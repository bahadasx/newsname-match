GOOD SEASON
LOOKED FOR
Monster Milk River Irrigation
Project Nears Completion.
WILL RUSH CONSTRUCTION
Water Will be Available in Spring for
40,000 Acre»—Flood Waters „
Will be Utilized.
The coming season will be one
of exceptional promise to the resi
dents of the towns and farms in the
Milk river irrigation scheme. With che
necessary water available for the
growing of crops, a sugar factory is
expected to locate in the valley, Glas
gow, Malta and Saco being the points
considered.
Water will be available this comirig
season for the irrigation of 40,000
acres of land. Work on the construc
tion of main canals and laterals in
the vicinity of Saco will be prose
cuted during the season, and by next
. „ . . , , nnn .„ .
fall a total of 71,000 acres will be
j ... . « *
under the ditch. Each year, as the
■ -i Li j it a
money becomes available and the de
/#«. ; .J
mand for irrigated land increases, ad
ditional work will be performed un
. w
tU the project is completed to its ul J
timate capacity and 200,000 acres of,.
tne!
as fertile land as is to be found in
country are under irrigation.
The Milk river project is the largest
yet undertaken in Montana by the
reclamation service.
Construction,
V '" >rS
work has been carried on for years
and the results will be manifest to
an appreciable degree this season for!
the first time.

for the maximum development, and
the other parts of these structures
will be constructed as a larger amount
of water is used.
There are two main storage fea
tures, one on the St. Mary's river, and
the other, the Nelson reservoir, north
of Saco. The flood run off the Milk
river will be diverted into the Nelson
reservoir and then drawn upon during
the irrigating season as needed, sup
plementing the Milk river run-off,
which in some years is very light, is
the St. Mary's storage, on the west
side of Glacier park. The St. Mary's
z'\ w ' '^rLfthe 0, ml
the St. Mary's river into the Milk
river, has been completed and the
water from this drainage basin will
be available for the Milk river valley
farmers. Considerable work has been
done on the Sherburne lakes storage
dams, which is part of the St. Mary's
feature, but because of the magnitude
of the work, it will not be completed
for several years, and until a larger
appropriation is made by congress.
The Nelson storage reservoir will
conserve 25,000 acre feet of water at
present, but when completed will have
a capacity of 133,000 acre feet.
WOLF POINT WINS CASE.
In a majority ruling of the state
railroad commission, signed by Com
missioners McCormick and Morley,
the citizens of Wolf Point, a town
on the Great Northern in Sheridan
county, won every point for which
they contended with reference to
train service on passenger trains
numbers 1 and 2.
The order requires that the Great
Northern be required to stop trains
numbers 1 and 2 on flag at Wolf
Point station, to let off or take on
passengers destined to points whfere
trains number 1 and 2 are scheduled
to make regular stops, until such
time as local, daylight passenger
service, both east-bound and west-1
bound, may be restored. The order,
becomes effective in 20 days.
Some interesting statistics
brought out in the order.
are
The town
has a population of 400 people, and
draws from a large territory o.n the
south, across the Missouri river. Un
til recently the Great Northern com
pany objected to stopping emigrant
cars at Wolf Point station, for the
reason that there was no crossing
over the river to points south.
The citizens made a strenuous ef
fort to overcome this difficulty and
raised sufficient funds to build a
pontoon bridge. The bridge was com
pleted September 15, and up to about
January 10, the time the river was
frozen over, and including a period
of a little over three months and a
half, there were 7,435 paying passeng
ers who crossed the bridge.
This only includes the drivers of
wagons and men passengers, as no

Missouri river in Montana. The bill
has passed the senate and has been
reported from the house committee on
commerce. The war department has
reported that there is no objection to
the bill.
From a report on the measure by
the department, it appears that the
company constructed a bridge in 1915
in deliberate violation of .the law.
They applied for authority and were
put on notice that the bridge could

not be built unless an act of congress

was secured. They nevertheless went

GRAIN THIEVES CAUGHT.
T. B. O'Neil is in the Hlaine county
jail held to the district court ou a
charge of grand larceny i.i the theft
of a load of flax, the property of
Frank Kirschcr, a farmer of the Big
Flat, residing about 35 miles north
east of Chinook. O'Neil was arrested
by Marshal Mike Buckley of Harlem
early in the week and bound over to
the district court. The flax was sold
to the elevator at Zurich on December
6, foii which O'Neil received a grain
check for $118.60. The grain was
easily identified because it was white
flax, an Alaskan variety and Kirscher
is the only man in the country who
has that kind of flax. O'Neil claimed
he was hauling the grain for other
parties. F. H. Anderson and Art
Cheney have also been arrested,
charged with being implicated in the
theft.

Coal Famine Threatens Towns

DRIFTS PREVENT TRAFFIC
Outlook, Dooley and Scobey Unable to

Weather on Record
Northern Montana is feeling the ef
weather in its history. Trains on all
lines have been delayed by heavy
snows and the extreme cold and both
passenger and freight traffic has
been practically at a standstill, de
spite the efforts of the railroads to
alleviate thé conditions. A coal fam
ine has threatened several towns in
this part of the state, and there are
towns in northern Sheridan county
that have been without train service
and coal for the last two weeks, de
spite the best efforts of the railroads
to get trains through. The supply of
fects of the longest spell of cold
coal in the city is very low at pres-j
ent and the few cars that have ar
rived the last few days have been dis
tributed where most needed.

FARMER HAS NARROW ESCAPE.
i w. Romig, a homesteader on the

0 f Nashua, narrowly escaped death
I by freezing last week, while return
| j ng tQ bome f rom N asbua .
Mr. Romig had been in Nashua
after supplies. Driving a span of
mules he started for home. He had
reached a point about four miles from
his destination when the snow be
gan to blow and darkness overtook
him. Unhitching the mules he
mounted one of the animals with the
intention of riding the remainder of
the distance home. However, the
snow became so blinding that he was
lost on the prairie. All night long he
rode, mostly in a circle, repeatedly
crossing his own tracks. The follow
ing morning neighbors saw him in the
' distance and went to investigate. Here
they found Mr. Romig in a delirious
condition, still seated upon the mule,
the animal standing still. He was
taken to the home of Mr. Erickson and
given all possible care.
His hands and feet were badly
frozen, and his tongue and face. His
tongue was so badly frozen that
turned black when thawed out. It is
miracle that Mr. Romig escaped
alive.—Nashua Independent.

Harry J. Smith and John McDonald,
the two gun men who were being held
here on a charge of robbery, were
given their release Monday in the
district court, the court granting the
motion of the defendants' attorneys
to dismiss the case because the infor

time specified by law.
Upon the release of the two men,
they were immediately arrested by

I TRAINS SNOWED IN.
I The towns of Outlook and Dooley
ion the branch line of the Soo in Sheri
' dan county, which parallels the Great
: Northern Scobey branch, have been
hard hit by the cold spell. It is
! ported that five freight trains have'
1 been snowed in and also a special
i train belonging to one of the officials
[of the line. Rotary snow plows are
ser-. operating on a relief expedition. At
the
the
Outlook there is a shortage of hard
a
and soft coal and the merchants are
waiting for fresh stocks, and mail and
express that is on the road.
With its coal supply exhausted two
weeks ago, with food supply low,
flour, no yeast, crackers or bread,
with schools and several business
places closed, Dooley is facing a des
perate condition. Lumber is being
used for fuel and with the lumber
supply low the citizens will use the
stockyard lumber. On homesteads
farmers are burning oat straw and

from being brought overland. There
has been no mail for three weeks.
It is rumored that an official of
the Soo line, being annoyed with sev
sral reports of snow bound trains, de
cided that he would go and take per
sonal charge of the work of clearing
the line, intimating that he would
show the boys what could be done in
battling with the elements, under his
own persona] and skillful guidance.
He attached hi« special car to a pow
erful locomotive and started on his
mission of mercy and where there
were but five trains stalled, there
were six, that of the official's being
the last one. It is reported that he
left the work to the men already on
the job and went to Plentywood, go

NOW A REPUBLICAN.
In the issue of January 14, Editor
E. H. McDowell of the Terry Tribune
gives his reasons for adopting the
republican standard, taking this
course notwithstanding he is a re
cent Wilson appointee as postmaster.
The editorial reads, in part:
"It is, in our judgement, imperative
that a republican congress be elect
ed this year in order that this ruin
ous policy toward the farmer, labor
er and manufacturer in this country
be discontinued in the passage of a
tariff law which will be just and
equitable to all the people—a law
which will prevent this being made
| the dumping ground for the great
surplus which is piling up in foreign
countries as a result of war.
"We have always favored a protec
