FIRST MEETING OF THE YEAR
HELD HERE LAST WEEK
A GOOD REPRESENTATION
PLANS OUTLINED FOR THE PROMOTION
OF ANGOSTURA PROJECT DUR
ING COMING YEAR
(By Charles A. Nyetrom, Rapid City,
Secretary Black Hills Angostura Irri
gation Association
The Black Hills Angostura Irriga
tion Assooiation held its first meeting
this year in Hot Springs Jannary 2'Jth.
There were representatives present
from Oral, Smithwiok, Ardmore, Oel
riohs, Ardmore, Buffalo Gap and Hot
Springs.
After listening to reports, ways and
means for carry
Idg
It will be remembered that this same
amendment was up for a vote at the
last general election, and in oommon
with a number of other measures went
down in the "vote no" oatopuign then
waged. At that time less than three
thousand votes would have changed
the result Its defeat was not due to
any organized opposition, but our
eastern ifrieuds, and many west of the
river knew nothing about this meas
ure, and therefore voted "no." The
South Dakota Irrigation Assooiation
then organized with the state histor
ian. Ooane Robison, as president, aru
a vice president in every western
oounty did valient service in cariying
on a publicity oampaign and had the
eleotion come a month later it is be
lieved the amendment woud have car
ried. This year it is proposed to start
the publicity oampaign early.
In line with the adoption of the irri
gation amendment is the Jones biil
now before congress. This bill pro
vides for federal guaranty of irrigation
distriot securities. Such distriots or
ganized under the laws of the several
states may ask the government for co
operation in finanoing the project. The
secretary of the interior shall oause the
projeot to be examined, and if ap.
proved, may on behalf of the govern
ment guarantee the interest on such
bonds to be issued by said district for
the oonstr notion and operation of the
projeot. Such bonds shall run not to
exoeed forty years and shall bear in
terest at not to exoeed four per oent
la case any distriot shall default in
its bond interest, suoh interest shall
be paid by the United States under its
guarantee and such interest and bonds
shall be made a lien npon all the lands
within the distriot. nf|
With government guaranty of inter
est bonds there would be no lack of
private capital to develop the hund
reds of larger and smaller projeots
throughout the country, should the
reoiamatiuu aervioe be slow in taking
hold. The one great drawback, as Sec
retary Lone save, has been the laok of
funds. Should the Jones bill paes, it
is anticipated there will be ample pri
vate funds available to take oare of
every feasible projeot in South Da­
tot?
•pep1
the proposed irri­
gation amendment at the next eleotion
were discussed. It was the oonoensus
of opinion that this campaign Bhoald
be carried on most vigorously east of
the river, where the people know little
or nothing about this amendment, and
having no information to aot upon,
will naturally oast an adverse vote.
It is proposed to show those voters
that this amendment merely permits
the legislature to provide for the or
ganization of irrigation distriots in
townships, oounties or otherwise, and
to operate the same under proper safe
guards, taxing the property directly
benefitted aouording to the benefits re
oeived. Those living outside the pro
posed projeots will not have a dollar
to pay. The cost of construction and
operation is placed where it belongs
and the general public will have no
added burden to bear. In fact, the
taxes of the general publio will be lesB
by reason of large areas of largely
nonproduotive land being brought un
der a high state of cultivation throagh
irrigation. This has been the exper
ience of every state where irrigation
has been tried. When our friends east
of the Missouri understand the provis
ions of this amendment it is believed
there will be little if any opposition to
its adoption. But it will take hard
and strenuous work to make this mat
ter clear.
V.
kota. Irrigation bonds would no
longer be held in bad repute in flnsn*
oial centers because of the operations
of unscrupulous get-rich-quick promo
ters who in years past have attempted
to sell "blue sky." With government
backing, the bonds will find ready sale
at lower rates of interest than oould be
secured independently by any private
oorporation.
The writer has written a number of
irrigation promoters and landowners
throughout the state, and particularly
those in the western half, urging that
a general meeting be called for the
purpose of discussing ways and means
forgiving the irrigation amendment
needed publioity The many replies
received have invariably been favor
able. It is generally realized that the
"sinews of war" will have to oome from
the western half of the state and that
it will take a vigorous, persistent pub
lioity oampaign to carry this amend
ment. To do this, a closer organiza
tion must be formed to direct and
finance the work. It has been sug.
gested that suoh a meeting to organize
be called to meet at Pierre next week
during the extra session of the legisla
ture, This would get out a larger
representation and would give oppor
tunity to start the publioity oampaign
at an early date.

EXTRA SESSION
IS fAllED
GOVERNOR BYRNE SETS DATE
FEBRUARY 8TH
TO ADJUST PRIMARY LAW
STATE LEGISLATURE WILL MEET AT
PIERRE TO ADJUST
OLD LAW
Pierre, S. Feb. 4.—The South Da
kota legislature will meet in special
sessibn to adjust the primary date, in
order to avoid the necessity of holding
two primaries. Governor Byrne's re
cent oanvass showed suoh aotion to be
the sentiment of the legislators and
the oall for the session has been issued
to convene here on Tuesday, February
3th.
This is the first speoial session ever
oalled in South Dakota, but general
oonfldenoe is felt that the legislators
will confine themselves to adjusting
the primary law and that the session
will not last more than three or four
days.
From a legal standpoint, ouly two
propositions were under consideration:
Either to hold the special April pri
mary, as provided under the law, or to
oall the legislature together and have
an earlier date fixed for the regular
primary. From the standpoint of ex
pense, the extra session will cost about
$G,000, as against probable expense of
130,000 for the special primary In ad
dition, there are some teohnioal flaws
that might be invoked against the
April primary.
Fixing an earlier primary date, thus
giving opportunity for legal oanvass
and certification of the vote on nation
al convention delegates, does not bar
efforts for a harmony delegation, but.
it will put a check on the system that
will destroy the enthusiasm of some of
the "harmony" advocates.
The basio idea in the Burke plan was
to foroe a vote on delegates at the pri
mary of June 6. This plan, very plain
ly, would not permit of any legal oan
vass and would give Burke and Look
hart an opportunity to designate the
republican oonvention delegates, re
gardless of primary eleotion results.
With an earlier primary date estab
lished, any so called harmony delega
tion oan be put to the test before the
voters of the state through the listing
of an opposition ticket.

Feature Photoplays at Morris Grand Last
Week Delight Crowds
Two feature photoplays at the Mor
ris Gi'and since our last issue are de
servii of special mention. "The
Carpet From Bagdad" on last Satur
day evening and "The White Sister"
on Tuesday evening of this week.
The first named featured Kathlyn
WillUms and the seoond Viola Allen,
two ot the most famous aotresses now
appearing upon the screen. It is sel
dom that a picture will thoroughly
please eaoh individual member of an
audience but we believe from the ex
pressions that these pictures did that
very thing.
Both these pictures are released un
der the V. L. S. E trademark and
Manager Parks informs us that eaoh
succeeding release will be fully as good
as the ones already sbown. It is hardly
neoeseary to go into detail about eaoh
story but the aoting, the settings and
the photography seems as near perfect
as oan be possible. Despite some
rougb usage that they are bound to
get, the physical oondition of the films
when they arrive here is very good,
The regular programs at the Morris
Grand are way above the average and
deserve a good patronage.
FARM HELP
Belle Fourche, S. D., Feb. 4 —Are
yoa going to need help this year Mr.
Parivjr: It. may seejn a little early to
some to answer this question now, but
it will pay you to do it. Seasons past
the majority have waited until the
last minute and then in many cases
were unable to get 6uffioient help to
take oare of their orops. The Com
mercial Olub of this oity would be
glad to help you in this matter and all
they ask is that you let them know
how many hands, what kind and at
what time you want tbem, just as early
as possible. If you U6e three men and
oould place your order for two now we
oould get these lined up for you while
there is'plenty of time and it would be
much easier and surer to get the third
one on a months notice. Think this
over and if the Commeroial Club oan
do you any good, oall or write.

THORNBY FOR R.
R. COMMISSIONER
WELL KNOWN DEADWOOD MAN
OUT FOR PROMINENT OFFICE
IS WELL KNOWN HERE
WAS THE FOUNDER OF HOT SPRINGS
AND ONE OF THE PIONEERS
OF THE HILLS
The Deadwood Pioneer-Times of
Wednesday has the following an
nouncement of Col. W. J. Thornby, of
that plaoe, who is in the raoe for the
offloe of state railway commissioner.
Ool. Thornby is one of the early pio
neers of the Hills and is the founder
of this oity, where he Bpends bis
vaoations with his host of friends.
Regarding his fitness for the office
the Pioneer-Times says:
"Several of the Biaok Hills and state
papers have recently mentioned the
name of Colonel W. ]. Thornby, of
Deadwood, in oonneotion with the re
publican nomination for the offloe of
state railway commissioner, and this
fact seems to have met with the ap
proval of his many friends throughout
the country west of the Missouri ri*er
and many of them have enoouraged
him to allow his name to go before the
voters at the coming primaries. In the
Black Hills especially, would Colonel
Thornby be a strong candidate, for it
is here that he is best known, and all
that is known of him is good. He has
lived in various parts and districts of
the Black Hille, and daring his resi
dence in all of them be has ever been
foremost in all work that would tend
to bring the section or district in
whioh he lived into greater prominence.
He has contributed his experience,
his time and his money to works of
beneficial nature, to enterprises which
would tend to improve not one seotion
of the Hills alone, but all parts of it,
and bis efforts have counted. When
traveling, he has ever had South Da
kota in mind and has been one of the
state's best boosters, not forgetting
this little kingdom west of the big river
whioh has been bis home for many
years. He has been public-spirited and
has kept in as close tonoh with the
times as any man in the state, knows
of itB needs and is particularly well in
formed on its business audits business
progress. He has followed oloseiy the
growth and settlement of the country
west of the river, and has watched its
change from a wilderness to a com
munity teeming with people and enjoy
ing prosperity. His selection to the
offloe of railway commissioner would
be one whioh would result in ben
efit to the people, and his high
character for honesty, integrity of
purpose and firmness, and the
intelligent foroe which he would
take to the position should recom
mend him to the voters of his party,
for in him they would have a com
petent, fearless officer and the people's
interest a positive champion Colonel
Thornby is one of the oldest residents
of the Black bills, and during the
thirty-nine years that have passed
since be first came to them he has held
many important places of trust. While
a resident of Custer county hj filled
the position of connty assessor, and
afterwards was elected oounty judge,
filling both in a manner most accept
able to the people. He represented
the forty-first senatorial distriot in the
state senate during the meeting of the
Third legislature, and his record as
such was excellent. For the past
eighteen years be has held the import
ant and responsible position of melter
in the United States assay office lu
Deadwood, and bis work has been such
as to receive the commendation of hiB
superiors. Three years ago he was
elected a member of the Deadwood
school boar j, and the excellence of hie
work as such is attested by every rest
dent of the distriot. Should Colonel
Thornby come'out for offloe—and he
undoubtedly will—he will have the sup
port of hundreds of enthusiastic work
ers, not only lu the Black Hills, but
east of the river.
"THE SINS OF THE MOTHERS"
Big Feature Photoplay at the Morris (irand
Tuesday Evening
On Tuesday evening, Febru
ary 8th, will be presented the
New York Suns' SI,000 prize
drama, "The Sins of The
Mothers" another one of the famous
I
Vol. 30 No. 42
Vitagraph Blue Ribbon Features, with:
Anita Stewart aud Earle Williams
featuring
HI.
all star, Vitagraph oast.
The New york Evening Sun follow
ing the first production of this great
photo drama, says:
"The Sins of the Mothers, 'the Even
ing Sun's 81.000 Prize Photo Play,
shown for the Hist time last night in
the Vitagraph Theatre, is going to
oause a whirlwind of talk. Who is
there who plays bridge, whioh almost
everyone does now and then, who will
not question one of the two outstand
ing lessons of the play? The play
wright, lilaine St,erne, has snatched a
story out or the everyday lives of
those who see her work and has built
up a stroDg drama based on the Bteadily
tightening grip that the gambeling
fever obtains on one to whom a littie
society card playing proves fascinating.
Only when the lives ot those the viotim
loves are wrecked and her own is sao
rifloed does the lust of the play lose its
DOla.
The drama was submitted last night
for the first time to tne publio and to
the writers of the 3,500 plays over
whioh it was the viotor, to justiry itself
and the judges who gave it the Blue
Ribbon in the Eveuing Sun's recent
big scenario contest. That it "made
good" the slightest study or its con
struction and the abservation of the
first night throng of spectators proved
amply. In the singlemindedness with
whioh it hammers home
The Vitagraph Company has made
the soreen in this case a very mirror
held up to the lives in front of it. The
drama is played in the most natural
manner, and the oharaoters are seem
ingly folk we all know. Director Ralph
Ince, among the moBt artistio of the
Vitagrapher's producers, has used his
talents to the full in presenting a
smooth running story that sweeps one
on irresistibly with its ourrent. Not a
single diversion from the main theme
oooure and once the preliminary show
ing of the business of the mother of
the play 1b over the aotion runs swiftly,
unerringly to the olimax.
Anita Stewart plays the heroine, or
perhaps she'd the villain, and repeats
the suooess she won With a difficult
role in "A Million Bid." As she steps
out of a convent, with many a look
backward, she is the personitioation of
girlish iunooenoe. Her progress from
then on through the suooesBive steps
of society bridge player, follower of the
races and devotee of the roulette table
is indicted with a sure and certain
hand. Her scenes of remorse and
anguish as 6he attempts to reclaim
nbioeir are strongly played and at ail
Limes siib uniibts the Bpmpathy of the
spectators, ahe dresses tne part in
the extreme or style aud with oorres
sponding ffeot.
The companion piece to her imper-i
sonation is that of Norris Oraham, the
husbund of the fated girl, whose aotion!
as District Attorney brings the ruin of
his own home and the destruction of
his wife. Earle Williams, always a
forceful actor, has touched no greater
heights eveu in '-The Christian." First:
as the sweetheart, then as the idolising?
bridegroom, next as the guardian hus-s
band who seeks to save his wife from
herself, finally as the determined Dis
triot Attorney who carries out infiex
ibly the pledges of bis oampaign, he is
precisely in character. His anger when
be discovers that his wife has again
succumbed to her mania is whole-'
hearted and effeotive. His efforts to
strengthen bis wife's stamina are'
among the most sympathio touches of:
ti a play. Julia Swayne Gordon as the^

ror the development of the mania fors

The other rolee. notably, those of the 5
daughter's old uurse, the satanio gam--,
bier De Voie, and the girl's woman
friend who introduces her to bridge
are in capable hands. The character!
of the old nurse particularly appeals,^
and Mary Maurice, one of the best of-1
the Vitagraph Players, makes it touoh
a plaintive note. Luoille Lee is the?
handsome and filttery friend and Pau

direot and
convincing story it is a masterpiece.
Its greatest merit from a teohnioal
point of view is its progressive
strengthening of purpose and effect as
eaoh blow is delivered. The first tell
ing stroke is followed by relaxation, a
ohange then comes of still more vital
power. So the situations follow, in
creasing each time In dramatic tensity
until the final climax outdoes all that
has.gone before. The simple beginning
oatohee the interest of the epeotators
at once and with eaoh succeeding soene
the play gains a stronger and stronger
grip until at the finish there is a thrill
of expectancy. That is fulfilled with a
denouuoement that is unconventional,
fresh and startling. So the last blow
is driven home bard.
