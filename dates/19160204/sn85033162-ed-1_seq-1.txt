. She was a member of the Epis
copal Church at Portland. For
a long time she kept a rooming
house on. the East Side, near
Morrison street bridge. The
remains were brought to New
port Friday evening and taken
to the Copeland undertaking
parlors where a short., service
was held Saturday morning by
Rev.E. T. . Simpson, rector of
the Church. The last rites of
the Church were conducted at
the grove by Rev. F. O. Jones,
Retired ' minister. The Masons
of Newport had charge of. the
funeral services. Mr. Russell
was a Mason. It was a cold,
bleak day and but few people at
tended the funeral and there
Were no flowers, but the beauti
ful snow was falling and the
grave was soon covered with
that emblem of the purity of the
soul when disenthralled from the
troubles and sorrows that afflict
us in this world. The only ones
from Portland was an aJopted
daughter, Miss Lena Russell, and
a friend,, Mrs. William Weaver.
And thus one by one the Oregon
pioneers are passing away and
soon the last name on the roll
will be called. Where the cities
and the railroads are now built

In his log cabin with his faithful
-wife by his side and the little
children huddled in the trundle
bed the bark of the wolf could be
heard and the roar of the moun
tain lion sounded through the
forest and the dreadful war f
whoop could be heard echoing
through the hills and the little
children huddled In the bed not
knowing whether they would be
massacred before morning or
not. These are the experiences
of some of the Oregon pioneers.
May the snow fall lightly on
their graves and may the mem
ory of what they, did remain
fresh and green in the minds of
those who came after them. It
' has been a hard Winter on old
people and persons weakened
from disease. Since the state
went dry it is hard to get good
v whiskey or brandy the very
best of stimulents and I have
no doubt many persons in their
weakened condition have died
for the lack of proper stimula
tion at the proper time. '
The basketball teams of New
port six young ladies and six
oung gentlemen went- to
Waldport Saturday to play the
teams there. It was a royal bat
tle. The girl team went on the
floor first. The floor was small
and new to- them, the baskets
were placed high, the cel'lng
was fifteen feet above the floor
and unless a person had special
training he could never get a
ball In the basket. The score
stood 15 to 10 in favor of Wald
port. The boys came, on the
floor next, full of the spirit of
the game,, and, observing the
conditions of things, pitched the
ball a little higher. It was a
hard fought battle. The home
"team disliked to be beaten on
tlelr own ground. . Every mem
"ber of the Newport team played
. their best cards and won by a
scratch. The score Btood 23 to
" 22 in favor of Newport. The
Vams of Newport speak In the
jighest terms of the royal treat?
went they received at the hands
tt the Waldport teams. The
band, led by Mr. Keady, was at
the wharf to greet them with
splendid strains of martial mu
sic. They were conducted, to
the Wakefield, where a splendid
supper awaited them. ' They
felt at home. At night a dance
was given at the Kent hall in
honor of the visiting teams.

A CHANCE IN EIGHTH
GRADE , EXAMINATIONS
, In the May and June eighth
grade examinations a new plan
will be tried in testing the pupils
in the Biibjects of U. S. History
and Civil Government, according
to a statement issued by State
Superintendent of Public In
struction J. A. Churchill. Dur
ing the examination the pupils
will be allowed to refer to their
text books, but the questions
will be so framed as to test the
ability of the pupil in expressing
what be has learned in clear,
concise language. The advan
tage of such a plan are, that it
permits the teacher to empha-"
size the historical events which
she considers most Important ;
it gives the trained teacher
greater freedom so that she can
do much higher quality of work
than simply helping the pupils to
"cram for an examination; it
frees the teacher and the pupils
from so teaching and studying' .
as to make the examination the
end; it tends to give the 'pupils
power of expression and elimin
ates the memorizing of unim
portant dates and facts.
"There is always danger,"
said Superintendent Churchill,
"of the examination system de
veloping a question, and answer
method unpedagoglcal, and the
examination usually deterioates
into a memory test. With this
new plan if the teacher will
adopt It for the pupils' monthly
tests they will learn by tho close
of the year how to use the text
as meieiy a reference work in
writing their final papers. The
questions will be so worded that
It will be impossible for the pu
pil to copy any amount from
the text book, but he will find
help by turning to it to refresh
his memory on some point that
has . escaped him Just for the
moment. When writing an ex
amination a pupil often finds he
can not recall the answer to a
question. He Is then liable fco
become so nervous and fright
ened that he will fail in the en
tire examination. This is really
the common senae way to pre
pare a pupil for his work in the
every day world, for if a man
has to write an article or prepare
a paper on any subject, he does
not attempt to depend upon his
memory for the proof which he
wishes to use from various
sources to substantiate his state
ments; rather, he has on his'
table a number of reference
works dealing with the subject,
upon which he Is writing. The
eighth grade examinations, to a
very large extent, set the stand
ard for teaching, and I am very
confident that this new plan will
strengthen , the work In the
eighth grade and give the puplj
much more power and confl
uence than he gains from the
memory tests. If his class
standing has been, high during
the year , and his English work
what It Bhould be, he will pass
a good examination. If his
class work has been below par,
the open book will be of 110 help
to him during the short hour of
the examination."
