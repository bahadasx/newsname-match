Columbia, Feb. 3.?The senate on
Wednesday morning killed the bill to
abolish the state tax commission, and
the house of representatives killed the
ibiH to establish a state mgaway commission.
The house has been steadily at work
on the appropriation bill since Wednesday
morning and the members
seem to be trying to clear the decks
for as early final adjournment as possible.
Tax Commission Remains.
The bill repealing the act creating
the state tax commission was called
up in the senate on : Wednesday morning
by Senator Stuckey, one of its authors.
He repeated 'nis arguments
[ against the bill. Senator Black supported
the Stuckey repealing oill and
said the state equalization board
should be composed of the .county auditors.
Senator Goodwin of Laurens
and Senator Patterson of Barnwell
joined in the efforts of Senator Stuckey
to abolish the tax commission. Senator
Kitchin opposed the bill repealing
I the tax commission, oe-ucuui v^ai |
who had moved to strike out tiie enacting

certain sources to induce him and others.

chance to solve the tax problems.
Senator Banks in his -speech favoring
the tax commission said the finance
committee were to report an amendment
restoring the board of review.
After further debate the senate by a
vote of 29 to 13 killed the bill to re%
peal the state tax commission.

By a vote of 60 to 37 the house on
Wednesday morning: killed the committee
bill to create a state highway
commission. The house showed that it
was against any general road law at
this time, putting to death, several
measures in this direction.
l^siatflrs as tfoHesre Trustees.
(Resolutions were introduced in ths
-house rn Wednesday morning calling
uj.oii the attorney general to report to
the house during this session members
cf the legislature holding any
otncr office and asking the secretary
of state for a list of those holding commissions
as trustees of State colleges,
and whether or not any of them are
members of the house.
Following the election of Mr. James
3 - - r\f thll
IH. nammonu as a UU VTi. |
T)oard of visitors of the Citadel, he announced
that he would be a candidate
for re-election to the general assembly
next summer, feeling that the position
of college trustee did not disqualify
him. Other members of the general
assembly, both senate and house, have
Ions: been state college trustees, and
II no doubt Mr. Hammond felt that he I
had ample precedent and should not
7 tie discriminated against. Other officials
high in the government are also
state college trustees.
This matter, to which The Herald
t and News has for some years been
calling attention, is the subject of a
good deal of interest and comment
! nere now. The Columbia Record, in
its issue of Wednesday afternoon, car
I ried the following editorial:
"All in the Same Boat
"Regarding the contributed article
in the Record of Tuesday with reference
to the holding of two offices, the
Record feels that the law has been
made quite plain. So plain was it in
I the days when the constitution was
fresh in the minds of the people that
old fashioned legislators used to reI
sign from school boards when they
I came to the general assembly.
"We can not see that the law admits
P any other construction, although
j we have heard that it is contended that
j there is another view. It is patent to \
ibly Working
.al Adjornment
us that the law is not observed as!
I
punctiliously as it should be. If we |
are to have law enforcement we should
also and first have law observance. ]
"The member of the general assem- J
bly from Richland who has been elect-1
ed a trustee of a state college is not
to much to be blamed, if there is adho
incit nritim'sm in this con
vvr wv J
nection, for the precedent had been set
numerously and for years.
"It might appear that this is a small
matter, but it is not. The agitation
over the holding of the office not oniy
brings censure upon individuals, but
causes too much partisan discussion,
and should be avoided as much as
possible.
"The Record is not criticising any
one individual in this matter, but we
are calling attention to the fact that
the public is dissatisfied with the way
in which this matter is drifting into
a general custom. We leave the responsibility
where it should rest."

There was introduced in the general
assembly 011 Wednesday a bill prepared
in the senate, providing .for a

The Two-Cent Rate Bill
The two-cent passenger rate bill,
which has passed the house, has received
a majority unfavorable report
by the senate committee. The senate
committee held an extended hearing
on the measure.
The senate this morning killed the

ships in state institutions. This is
one of tiie bills that has caused the
greater part of the debate in the senate
during the present session. The
amendment, which provided that the
board of charities investigate the financial
status of those holding scholarships
and report t'neir findings was
adopted. The board of charities is expected
under this amendment to make
a thorough investigation of the beneficiaries
of scholarships.
The house spent the morning up to
the time of taking a recess until 5
o'clock tonight considering t'ne appropriation
bill. So far the bill is going
through practically as it came from
the ways and means committee. 'Tiie
only change was to increase the litigation
fund at the disposal of the attorney
general from $1,200 to $3,000.

any one. It was a purely voluntary

NEWBERRY FOLK IX FLORIDA
Mr. Eugene S. Blease Tells The Herald
and News of Yisit to Land of Flowers?Many
Newberrians There.
#
Mr. Eugene S. Bleas-e returned to
Newberry this week from a visit of two
weeks to Florida, to which state he
went on professional business, and incidentally
sigiit-seeing. Mr. Blease
says that he enjoyed his trip very
much and that Florida has a great future
before it, for there is so much
room and opportunity for development
and the people of the state have the
progressive spirit. Two things especially
do the Floridians believe in,
good schools and good roads. Mr.
Blease took and automobile ride from
Jacksonville to St. Augustine, a distance
of forty miles, and all but about
five miles of the trip was over a road
paved with brick. And strange to say
1 -3
mat one can travel uvci mat u m
several instances for seven and eight
miles without seeing a dwelling no use.
Around ^Sanford and Ocala the roads
are just splendid, many of them being
brick paved and others a sand and clay
mixture. Sanford, a town just about
the size of Newberry, has at least
three-fourths of its streets paved with
brick, and is a beautiful little city on
Lake Monroe. The city is now having
a sea wail built on the lake front at a
cost or over $bu,i/uu.
"Taxes seem to be a little higher in
Sanford and other Florida towns than
in Newberry.'' said Mr. Blease. "but
the people down there don't seem to
mind paying taxes so long as they get
good roads and good schools, and they
say that money spent for these purposes
is a mighty good investment.
The auto drivers and owners say that
they get their money back pretty soon
in the cost of keeping up tlieir cars.
The farmers bring in their produce for
-shipment in automobiles, oftentimes
carrying in a load and getting back
home for breakfast."
Mr. Blease ran across several old
South Carolinians while in Florida.
He was told that a very large per
/>on+oora r\f the noonlo- in Marion conn
: v^u vi i/**v/ -?? - - ? ?- ? ?
ty, of which Ocala is the county seat,
are originally 'South Carolinians. Tnis
county is one of the best sections of
Florida and the people there seem to
be especially prosperous.
At Sanford Mr. Blease found many
Newberry folks. l.Vr. Forrest Lake is,
and for some years has been, one of
the leading citizens of Sanford. Mr.
Lake is now president of a prosperous
~ L J Paw m o mr rod re Via
uailiv Oil ill VI U. i'Ul ma u j j tcvio ++\>
was mayor of the city and is now one
of the leading members of the state
legislature. While a member of the
legislature, Mr. Lake secured the passage
of a bill making a new county,
Seminole county, with. Sanford the
county seat, and in recognition of his
services the people of Sanford pre*

service and re-elected him to the legislature
without opposition. Mr. Lake
keeps up very well with Newberry
people and is always glad to see them.
He has a beautiful home, a charming
wife and two pretty little girls, and he
is fond of entertaining his old Newberry
friends. Mr. Lake loves to tell
people of tSanford and the opportuni
ties there and is a real live booster for
his state, county and city. Around
Jacksonville and other places, as well
as in Sanford, Mr. Blease heard Mr.
Lake spoken of as one of the big men
of Florida, and his name has often
been mentioned in connection with the j
office of governor and congressman.
Mr. Blease also saw Mrs. G. D.
Bishop, formerly Miss Bessie Schumpert
of Newberry, and her husband
and Mrs. Bishop's sister, Mrs. Chas. E.
Bell of Atlanta, who was on a Aisit to
Mrs. Bishop. These charming ladies
are popular in the society life of Sanford.
Mr. Bishop is one of the leading
business men of Sanford. being the
. i
manager of a large paper concern, ana '
he is recognized by all who know him
as a young gentleman of great business
ability and sterling worth.
One of the leading farmers of the
Sanford section is Mr. Henry H'. Chappell,
an old Fairfield boy, and related
to the Wickers and Chappells of this
county. Mr. Chappell doesn't farm as
