The City Council is Indig
nant Over Unwarranted
Action of Charter
Constructors.
At the final meeting of the Palatka
.Charter Board, held on the 17th of
January, the following item appears
on the minutes:
"The Manager of the Morning Post
(Mr. H. P. Nerwich) appeared before
the board and requested that he be
awarded the publication of the pro
posed charter at 20 per cent discount
from the legal rate; on motion of Mr.
Walton, seconded by Mr. Davis, the
publication of the proposed charter
was awarded to the Palatka Morning
Post."
The law requires that the proposed
charter shall be published in some
newspaper of the city four weeks pre
ceding the election, and that the first
publication must not be less than 25
days preceding the day of the charter
election. The election has been call,
ed for the 29th inst.
The first publication of the proposed
Charter appeared in the Palatka Morn
ing Post last Monday. That was the
first intimation the Times-Herald 0
the Daily Democrat had that the pub
lication of the document had been or
dered. The Palatka News knew of it
on Thursday of last week.
On Tuesday last with the approval
of the other city publishers, the pro
prietors of The News, believing that
the Charter Board had done an un
lawful act, looked into the matter.
As business men and tax payers of
the city, there was of course a modi
cum of selfishness in this investiga
tion. As business men and tax pay
ers these investigating publishers are
justified in securing business for
their respective publications in every
legitimate manner.
They found in the first place that
the Charter Board had performed an
illegal act in awarding the publica
tion of the proposed charter.
The law ia found under Section 11,
Chapter 6940, Laws of Florida, known
as the "Charter Board Act." This
section says:
"The Clerk or Secretary of the
Council, or Legislative body of the
city or town shall cause to be publish,
ed in a newspaper, etc."
It will thus be seen that the law ex
pressly makes the giving out of this
charter for publication a prerogative
of the Clerk of the City Council.
Knowing that the other publishers
of the city had time to seek this bus
iness and make a price on its publica
tion the publishers of The News, with
the approval of the other city publish
ers, addressed a letter to City Clerk
Williams, asking that they be given
an opportunity to make a price on the
work. '
Mr. Williams was not aware that he
had the power to award this printing
until his attention was called to it by.
The News. He was overcome with
his responsibility and for this reason
The News advised him to secure the
advice of the City Council and the
City Attorney.
At the meeting of the City Council
Tuesday night Mr. Williams laid our
communication before the Council.
The City Attorney who was present,
after considering the matter, agreed
with the opinion of The News, that
the Clerk, AND THE CLERK ONLY,
had authority under the law to award
the printing of the proposed Charter.
There was much discussion in the
Council over this usurpation of power
on the part of the Charter Board.
Speeches were made in condemnation
by Messrs. Becks, McNally, Gay, Aus
tin, Jarrett, Kennerly and perhaps
others. With the exception of Mr.
Howell A. Davis, a member of the
Charter Board, every member of the
council made known in some manner
his indignation over the action of the
Charter Board.
A resolution was passed advising
City Clerk Williams to get tenders
from all the publishers of the city and
to award the publication to the lowest
bidder. '
Alderman Howell A. Davis defend
ed the Charter Board's action in a vig
orous manner. He said that a year
of two ago the council asked the
Times-Herald and the Palatka News
to make tenders for certain city print
ing, and that both papers made bids
at the legal rate. "Now," said he,
with that peculiar nasal twang ne
uses when he desires to be particu-
laily impressive "they come here and
make a howl because this Charter
Board has given out this printing at
a discount of 20 per cent from the le
gal rate."
Mr. Davis is partly right. These
papers did charge the legal rate and
refused to cut under, on this particu
lar advertising, because it was some
thing the city did not expect to pay
for; and Mr. Davis knows this as well
as do the publishers of The Palatka
News. On occasions when the publi
cation has been an expensive, one,
these papers have always made com
petitive bids. 1
,But here was an extraordinary
niece of printine, one that might
nroDerlv be called WHOLESALE
printing; one that was sufficiently
large to warrant a cut price; one mat
at the legal rate would be nothing
less than a graft something that no
city would stand for when run on bus
iness principles.
Under the State law boards of. coun.
ty commissioners are prohibited from
spending more than three hundred
dollars of the people's money without
securing bids on the contemplated
purchase. The City Council is not
subject to this law but The News sub
mits that it should be.
There is, however, a resolution of
the Council, adopted some time ago,
which prevents that body from mak
ing purchases over a certain lesser
amount, without first securing bids.
On Tuesday morning bids for this
printing were submitted by The Pa
latka News, The Times-Herald and
The Daily Democrat. The Morning
rost reiusea to mane anotner Did
said it had legal advice.
Before considering these bids. Mr.
Williams asked the City Attorney to
give him a written opinion covering
his rights and duties in the matter.
This request was in the form of a
written communication to the City At
torney in which Mr. Williams, the
city clerk, recited the action of the
Charter Board and said:
"PURSUANT TO THE ACTION
OF THE CHARTER BOARD IN
AWARDING THE CONTRACT FOR
PUBLICATION TO H. P. NERWICH,
I furnished Mr. Nerwich with a copy
of the proposed charter as proposed
and adopted by the Charter Board,
and helped with a part of the proof
reading." '
Make Clerk the Scapegoat.
Replying to the communication of
Clerk Williams, Mr. H. E. Merryday,
City Attorney, wrote his opinion as
follows:
February 2, 1916.
"Mr. W. A. Williams, Jr.,
"City Clerk,
"Palatka, Florida.
"Dear Mr. Williams:
"In answer to your inquiry of even
date herewith as to your powers, au
thority and duty with reference to the
publication of the proposed charter of
the City of Palatka, and basing our
opinion on the facts stated in your
letter, we beg to advise you as fol
lows: "Where a duty is imposed on an of
ficer or commissioner, the power and
authority to exercise and perform
that duty is implicitly given.
"Under Section 11, Chapter 6940,
Laws of the State of Florida, known
as the "Charter Board Act4" it is
HAUii LtlE JJUXl Ur THE ULEKK
OR SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL
OR LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT
OF THE CITY TO HAVE the pro
posed charter or charter amendments,
together with a notice of the elec
tion, published in a newspaper pub
lished in such city or town, once each
week for four consecutive weeks, next
preceding said election, the first pub
lication thereof to be not less than
twenty-five days prior thereto.
"When the Charter Board complet
ed its work and adopted and signed
the proposed charter, it became the
duty of the Clerk of the Council to
have the proposed charter published
as required by law, and this duty de
volved upon the Clerk without the in
tervention or act of any other board
or arm of the government.
"It was the duty of the Clerk to
have the proposed charter published
so that the first publication thereof
would be not less than twenty-five
days prior to the election.
"From the facts stated in your com
munication, we are constrained to
conclude thatJyou performed this duty
when you gave the proposed charter
to Mr. H. P. Nerwich, Manager of
the Palatka Morning Post, for pub
lication; and having performed the
duty and given the publication to Mr.
Nerwich, you could not entertain the
bids that have been submitted to you."
It will thus be seen that the publi
cation will continue in The Palatka
Morning Post, and so continue on a
MERE TECHNICALITY. Mr. Wil
liams as City Clerk, did actually PASS
THE COPY OF THE CHARTER lo
the publisher of the Morning Post.
But as he said in his letter to the
City Attorney, he did so "PURSU
ANT TO THE ACTION OF THE
CHARTER BOARD IN AWARDING
THE CONTRACT FOR PUBLICA
TION TO H. P. NERWICH."
The Palatka Times-Herald was the
lowest bidder. It made a price on
the publication of this proposed char
ter which in dollars and cents was ex
actly TWO HUNDRED FORTY-TWO
DOLLARS AND FIFTY-THREE
CENTS cheaper than the rate the
Charter Board illegally agreed to pay
the Palatka Morning Post.
The Palatka News did not expect
to get that business, though it made
a bid BUT AS A TAX PAYER OF
THE CITY OF PALATKA IT WAS
YESTERDAY. IS NOW and WILL
FOREVER BE OPPOSED TO THE
ILLEGAL EXPENDITURE OF THE
FUULIC FUNDS even for Charter
purposes.
It is reported that at the meeting
of the Charter Board at which this
publication was awarded, that Mr.
Hamm and Mr. Yelverton and Mr.
Merryday urged the advisability of
securing bids, but this was evidently
voted down. However, if the Char
ter Board had done so, their action
would still have been illegal. The
A Distinctive Reason
What is the chief reason for the superi
ority of Royal Baking Powder?
There are several good reasons, but there
is one which distinguishes Royal from other
baking powders.
This reason, which every woman should
know, is that Royal Baking Powder is made
from cream of tartar, which comes from
grapes. This means a healthful fruit origin.
It means natural food as distinguished from
mineral substitutes used in other baking
powders.
There is no alum nor phosphate in Royal
Baking Powder.

F. D. WATTLES RESIGNS
E
Says he Cannot Spare the Time
From His Private Business.
Frank D. Wattles, president of the
Putnam county school board, has sent
his resignation to Gov. Trammell
The resignation was also read to the
school board at its meeting last
Tuesday, and seems to be final.
J. his is indeed a serious loss to
Putnam county. Mr. Wattles, by vir
tue of his office as president of the
board, has given much more of his
time to school affairs than have any
of his predecessors. Hi started out
with other members of the present
board to make a record in. the con
duct of our school affairs; he intended
to wipe out the present school board
debt (and this is being accomplished)
through a thoroughly business-like
administration of school affairs. All
unnecessary expense has been elimi
nated. Mr. Wattles has done more;
he has personally visited all, or nearly
all the country schools of the coun
ty and learned by a personal inspec
tion of their condition.
Mr. Wattles is a business man;
his business requires his personal at
tention, and he found he cuold not
give it and attend rightly to his of
ficial duties. Hence his resignatiin.
He waa one official whose work told
handsomly for the public benefit, and
he will be missed.
The following is his letter of resig
nation!:
Honorable Board of Public Instruction:'
Putnam County, Fla.
Gentlemen:
Feeling that I shall be unable to
give the necessary time to the schools
the coming year ,1 have determined
to retire from the Board of Public
Instruction, effective at the close of
the present meeting, and my formal
resignation has been forwarded to the
Governor to-day.
I apprised you some time ago of
ny intention to resign January 1, but
on account of illness of teachers and
pupils of School No. 1, necessitating
an extension of the Christmas vaca
tion, I acceded to the request of the
Superintendent to defer my retire
ment until normal conditions should
again prevail.
This conclusion to leave the School
Board has not been hastily reached,
but rather after long and careful con
sideration, and I assure you that I
am prompted by no cause or motivj
ther than that stated above. The
Board is engaged in work that is of
utmost importance to every resident
of Putnam County more urgent and
necessary than brick roads end more
beneficial than all else for which pub
lic money is used. For the business
of the Board, with the innumerable
details of school management, to be
properly cared for, a great deal of
time and attention is required. To
this work I have given liberally of
my time during the past year, but
now convinced that I cannot contin
ue to do so, I am unwilling to remain
a member and neglect the duties of
the position.
I am very much gratified to know
that the office of the Superintendent
and all of the affairs of the Board
are in such splendid condition, as
shown by the recent examination and
report of the State Auditor, and that
our efforts along economic lines, nec
essitated by circumstances, have not
been unavailing. The present Board,
immediately after its organization,
January 1, 1915 determined to pur
ne a policy of equitable distribution
of funds, to investigate every item
and purpose for which school money
was to be used, and to eliminate ev
ery unnecessary expense. This plan
has been productive of most pleasing

P.Matka, Feb. 1, 1916.
That the school board feels a sense
of loss over the retirement of Mr.
Wattles is shown in the following res
olutions which were passed by the
body after his departure:
Whereas, Mr. Frank D. Wattles,
who has been the capable chairman
of this board for the past year, has
decided to resign, as he finds he can
not erive time from his business tn
fill the office in the way he deems
best for the public; therefore, be it
Resolved, That in accepting the
resignation of Chairman Wattles, we
do so with sincere regret. As mem
ber of this board he has proven alert
progressive and useful, and as chair
man he has been just and fair in his
rulings and action. At a sacrifice of
his personal business interest, he has
given freely of his time fo not only
the Board meetings but to every mat
ter oi concern to the educational wel
fare of the county.
He has ever manifested a zealous
interest in our schools, and his policy
of economy has aided, greatly to the
splendid financial showing the board
is now able to make. We appreci
ate his many courtesies and generous
support, and our association will ever
be pleasantly remembered.
Resolved, further, That these reso
lutions be embodied in the minutes
of this board, and that the county pa
pers be furnished a copy for publica
tion. -
Respectfully submitted,
