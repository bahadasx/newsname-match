ors were recorded In the various
schools. In most eases, they were
given a chance to observe the regular
work, but In several schools the pro
gram was varied In the afternoon to
a certain extent. Marshland school,
under the efficient direction of Mrs.
Jonnlo Love, standardised on that
day, and a part of the afternoon was
given to a suitable program; lunch
eon was served, etc. The Quincy
school devoted a part of the after
noon to special features, the County
Superintendent being present and
visiting with them. Reports from
every side Indicate that the day was
a success, and It Is hoped that It will
help toward a better co-operation be
tween teachers, patrons and pupils.
The County Superintendent vlBlted
the Bcappooae school on January 27,
and found everybody at work as us
ual tn the progressive spirit which
Scappoose knows how to show.
January storms have Interfered
very materially with the progress of
the various schools throughout the
county, and many of them have been
obliged to close a portion of the
time on account of the inclement
weathor.
Miss Edna Dalzlel has been elected
tonohor of District No. 60, to take

SUNSET CLUB LOST
Sunset Iawh to Portland, Score
42-241
In a fast and exciting game of bus
ketball hero Saturday night, the local
Sunset Club lout to the Multnomuh
Club second team of Portland by the
score of 42-26. The Portland boys
put up a good clean game and won
on their superior playing, though the
locals were hundlcupped by the ab
sence of their star guard, Stewart
McKlo, and by McDonald not being
able to glvo his best services, owing
to his being sick all week. The lo
cals were outweighed by at least 1 2
pounds to the mun, and also against
a team of longer expeiience. How
ever, had the locals their best lineup
In shape there would have been a dif
ferent story to toll, but as It was, the
Portland boys deserve their victory.
F. Sten of St. Helens, was easily
the star ot the game, as he mude 22
of the 26 points niado by his team,
while Masters and Mulrhead were the
high point men for Multnomuh, with
Itrooks, the 190-11). guurd pluying a
greut defensive game.
The Sunset team has only one more
game scheduled for the home floor,
which will be against the fust Soll
wood Swastikas, who won two games
from the locals lust year. However,
the Suuselers are out for revenge this
year and will assure you a good ex
hibition, it you will walk out to the
Sunset gym Suturday night, Feb. 12,
and donate 25 cents to the club.
FIRE BOYS BANQUETED
Mayor Morton tendered the fire
boys a banquet Monday evening. This

In which he holds the hoys whose
voluntary service to the city is of
Inestimable value. Tho evening was
spent In toust and song. As a host,

local Institute at Kuinier, making the
entire trip to and from Deep Creek,
and Is entitled to the chroma for for
tltude and courage displayed In mak
ing this arduous journey both ways
over the mountains on tho snmo day
Miss Mildred Taylor of the Jeffer
son High School of Portland, has
been elected as Becond grude toucher
at ScuppooBe to succeed Miss Elsie
Philip, who has resigned to accept
a similar position tn tho Salem
schools.
The school lunds of this stnte
have boon disposod ot and tho schools
derived not one-tenth ot a fair value
for them, and the state fund amounts
to about $1.76 per capita. The stnte
fund ot Washington pays a per capita
school tax of about four times as
much as Oregon, because their
school lunds wero under better man
agement. Tlie land grant formerly
clalmod by the Southern Paclllo and
worth approximately one hundred
million dollars, Is tn tho hands ot
congress for dispoBut and will in
some form be largely returned to the
public. It should be put tn the
school fund of the state of Oregon,
where every man, woman and child
of this state would be benefited di
rectly or Indirectly. All Oregon
should unite In an effort to place
this Immense fortune In the school
fund where all will benefit. If mun
aged properly In connection with our
state fund, it would produce funds
enough to maintain our schools with
out taxation. Taxes are too high and
here is an opportunity to reduce thorn
materially. One section of school
lund located in Columbia county,
within a mile ot one of our graded
schools, was bought for sixteen hun
dred dollars; the other follow sold It
for fifty thousand dollars. This Is a
fair Bamplo ot school land transact

a letter to our senior Benntor toduy

OPPORTUNITY
FEED THE BIRDS
The attention of the public Is again
called to the necessity of feeding the
birds, to save thorn from death by
starvation. With the ground covered
with snow, It in Impossible for the
feathered songsters to secure their
usual food, and they are more easily
affected by the cold. Bread crumbs,
apples, or beef suet, are very wel
come articles of food for the song
birds.
Game birds are being cared tor by
Deputy Garno Warden Brown, who
has mude a number of visits to the
woods and scattered grain. He wishes
to publlcally acknowledge his obli
gation to the St. Helens Rod and Gun
Club for the use of un auto.
He reports China pheasants in
fulr condition but the danger to these
birds comes when the snow begins to
melt, especially the roosters, as it Is
claimed that the wet snow adheres
to their tall feathers and weighs
them down. Then they sometimes
roost on low branches and their tails
freeze to the biiow and they are un
able, to escape snd perish from cold
and hunger.

A VILE CANARD
False Statement Circulated Concern
ing Houlton I'ostoflke
No petition has been circulated in
St. Helens to have the postofflce at
Houlton abolished, neither has there
been talk of one or has there been
any desire to abolish the postofflce at
that place. On the contrary, this
matter was thoroughly investigated
prior to the consolidation and the de
partment cheerfully consented to the
retention of the Houlton office should
the two cities be consolidated.
The postofflce inspector who was
here during the holidays, made the
statement corroborating the action
between the officials of the two cities
and the postofflce department.
We place no credence in the state
ment of the Portland yellow Journal.
Its bureau of information seems to be
tinged with yellow In every depart
ment. Mr. Rutherford never heard of
such a petition being circulated or
even contemplated.
St. Helens has kept faith with
Houlton to the very letter and will
continue to do so. The city council
and Commercial Club are composed
of honorable men, men far above vi
olating honor between neighbors.
Consolidation has improved both
cities and harmony and good fellow
ship will make a healthy and prosper
ous community, when otherwise fac
tional strife will retard the upbuild
ing and success of any community,
no matter how great the natural ad
vantages may be. Let us all pull and
all pull together.
CREAMERY MEN

The Or-zu Co-operative Dairy
Exchange was the name selected by
the selling organizatiion of creamery

members will be taxed one-half cent
for every pound sold through the ex

Ed Cary, Cnrlton; executive commit
tee. R. C. von Lehe, Philomath; W.
A. Smiley, Reedsport; J. J. Wheal

THAT HOWLING STORM
Great Damage to Proerty and Busi
ness Paralyzed
The weather clerk is determined to
smash all previous records. Snow and
lots ot It has fallen In this section.
but it only remained for a few days,
but this winter It stays with us Ike
a poor relation.
Sunday it snowed all day and ditto
for' Monday. Tuesday morning the
ground was covered to a depth ot 17
Inches. In the evening It commenced
to rain and froze as it tell. It de
veloped into a silver thaw and great
damage was wrought to telephone
and electric poles and wires.
In the evening at about 9 o'clock,
the electric light wire went down and
out and the city was in darkness. On
account of a number ot wires being
down, the company shut off the
"juice" to prevent danger from fallen
wires. Telephone and electric poles
crashed to the earth and the drive be
tween this place and the depot was a
network of wires and poles Wednes
day morning.
Coming from the depot Tuesday
evening Johnson with his auto bus,
noticed a pole gradually falling, and
putting on full speed, passed under.
Stevens' bus, which followedwaa not
so fortunate, but crashed into the
wires. He was badly enmeshed but
no serious damage resulted.
Trees were shorn of limbs and
those residing near timber could
scarcely sleep for the thunder and
It is reported that It 1 will be a
week or more before we can have
electric service.
Telephone service Is badly cripp
led. The weather has moderated but
little and while a large force of men
have been put to work but little
headway is gained on account ot the
ice, rain and snow.
Great icicles are hanging from the
roofs and life Is endangered when
walking near buildings.
The mill closed Monday after runn- '
Ing a few hours. The company will
take advantage of the opportunity
and make the annual repairs which
will mean about two weeks' lay-off
for the men.
The shipyard has been closed since
Saturday. The weather conditions
are a black eye to this industry as
they are already behind time with
work on the big Bhlp. As soon as
weather conditions will permit a
larger force of men will be put on.
More snow fell Thursday, which
increased the depth to 20 inches.' All
business is paralyzed. Even the town
clock has gone on a strike and re
fuses to strike. Wood is a scarce
article because it cannot be delivered.
No trains either. The mail train
reached Warren Wednesday after
noon and sidetracked for the north
KIM 1 1 1I Train mrn ,1111 ntt aiT1irJr

The wires were down and the dis
patcher was unable to isue train
orders.
