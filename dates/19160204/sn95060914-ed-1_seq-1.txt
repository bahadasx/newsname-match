Started Drill Work Monday
Night and Made a Fine
Showing
FULL COMPANY NEXT MEETING
National Guardsmen Not to Be
Excluded by the United
Mine Worker
The Safford Company of the
National Guard of Arizona met at
Briers Hall Wednesday night and
took active drill work A large
number were present and indica
tions point to an active and effi
cient company
The next meeting will be held
next Monday pight at Briers Hall
and it is hoped that a sufficient
number will be present to com
plete the organization of sixty
eight men so that the equipment
can be secured from the State and
target practice be taken up with
the beginning of the outdoor tar
get season in May
All persons interested in military
matters are requested to attend
the next meeting
Many have asked whether en
listment in the national guard
would compel service in time ol
war The regulations all require
that in the event of war all natiopai
guardsmen will be requested to
volunteer their services and all
that do volunteer and successfully
pass the physical examination will
be accepted but no member oi
the national guard can be ordered
out of the State unless they volun
teer and are re enlisted
The government is encouraging
the organization of the national
guard only for the reason that in
modern war trained men especial
marksrnejvare required and with
out training it matters not how
courageous or willing a volunteer
may be he is useless on the firing
line until trained and this prep
aratory training it is hoped to ob
tain in the national guard
Many do not recognize that to
be a soldier requires that he not
only knows how to drill to shoot
and to inflict damage on the enemy
but must also be able to take care
of himself physically preserve his
health and thereby help preserve
the health of his comrades
The lessons in sanitation and
physical training taught in the na
tional guardarenot only a help to
the individual member of the
guard but to the community in
which he lives as his knowledge
is more or less beneficial to his
neighbors and friends
Will Not Exclude Guardsmen
Those in control of the national
affairs of the United Mine Workers
of America won another victory
in the convention at Indianapolis
lnd Monday when they defeated
a resolution designed to exclude
national guardsmen and members
of state constabularies from the or
ganization
After the administration leaders
had defeated the exclusion propo
sition they presented a resolution
which was adopted without oppo
sition petitioning the American
Federation of Labor and various
state federations to secure the en
actment of legislation that will
prevent military forces and pri
vately armed gunmen from acting
as strikebreakers

Seventy-two-Year-Old Santa
Cruz Boy Takes His First
Aeroplane Flight
Terence OBryan a seventy-two-year-old
farmer from Santa Cruz
Cal flew over the bay November
22 1915 with A H Longhead the
aviator and was so pleased with the
experience that he was later trying
to find Art Smith in the hope that
he might induce the expert on aerial
insanity to take him up for some
real lofty tumbling
Farmer OBryan paid several
visits to Loughead8 hydroaeplane
before he could make up his mind
to take the adventure Finally on
the morning of November 22d he
took the plunge When he landed
after a flight around Alcatraz he
was in high spirits
That beats anything I ever
rode he said
He came back in the afternoon to
ask for Art Smiths address
I have got to go up with that
boy Smith he explained I want
to do some of that real flying You
know the stuff that that fellow
Loughead does is too tame for me
Mr OBryan is well known here
having been a resident here for
many years before making his resi
dence in Santa Cruz Cal In fact
he spends about as much time here
as a guest of his son M E OBryan
the genial manager of the Gila Val
ley Furniture and Hardware Store
as he does at his home in California
Although Mr OBryan is seventy
two years of age he is more active
than many men twenty years young
er He is the youngest old boy we
know and we dont doubt his trip
in Lougheads hydroaeroplane was
rather tame

The appeal case of Arthur Cooper
who was found guilty in the Justices
Court by the jury of ihe charge of
assaulting the Kev G L Horene
came up for trial Monday morning
in me superior Court Judge Frank
B Laine presiding
After argument on a demurrer
presented by the defense Judge
Laine sustained the demurrer on
the ground that the complaint had
not been correctly drawn
This practically throws the case
dufof court unless another prose
cution on a proper comDlaint is
started
It would not be a bad idea if all
parties concerned would drop the
matter and forget the unfortunate
occurrence
The next ense called was that of
George HammCod arrested by Con
stable Lancaster Christmas night
on the Solomonville road on a
charge of bootlegging
A jury was secured and the trial
proceeded Hammond was a wit
ness for himself and Geo Bafnej
and William Gillen were also wit
nesses
The prosecution was unable to
get any testimony that showed that
the last named witnesses knew that
the whiskey was on the car though
the counsel for the defense acknowl
edged that the whiskey was founo
on the car by the officer
Ihe case went to the jury about
230 p m The jury was out unti
1154 p m when the foreman re
ported that it was impossible foi
the jury to agree and Judee Laine
discharged the jury
Monday afternoon after the jury
in the Hammond case retired Judge
McAlister announced that the trial
jurors would be excused until Feb
ruary 23d owing to the fact thai
the mining case from Greenlet
county which was to be tried Tues
day morning had been postpones
until that time on account of sick
ness of counsel in case
The several cases that vycre to bV
tried the latter part of this weel
were also postponed owing to th
expense of holding over the juron
until they could be reached
Tuesday morning Lester Eller
and Fred Elkins charged with
bootlegging pleaded guilty to thi
charge and Judge McAlister im
posed a fine of 10000 and foui
months in the county jail for each
defendant
