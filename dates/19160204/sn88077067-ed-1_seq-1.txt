decision handed down In the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals In
the eiise of Ida Mc.N'ortlon against

from the District Court nt Cleveland.
One of the main points Involved was
the (luestlon of whether father Is
responsible for the acts of his son,
when the latter Is driving the father's
car. In thin case the upper court
held that Mr. Denlson was liable for

lug at the time and sustained the ver
dict of $10,000 awarded by a Jury.

Come Across for Failure to Stand
by Contract Selling Farm,
Says Judge Miller.
John G. Van Deusen, of the faculty
of Celina High School, was elected to
membership by the New York His
torical and Archelogical Society at
its last annual .meeting. This organ
ization is the largest of its kind in
the country and only those persons
are admitted to membership who
make an important contribution to
New York history. Mr. Van Deusen s
claim to membership is based upon
his book 'The Loyalists in London
which was published some two years
ago. At the- time of its publication
the book received aome favorable
comment but did not attract wide at
tention. Early last August the Hart
ford Times, of Hartford, Connecticut
secured exclusive rights to the manu
script and published it in the form of
a serial which ran for rive months.
Almost immediately there was an

his decision in the case of Ralph
Mills versus Preston Bradshaw, on
Thursday afternoon before returning

perform a contract which had been
agreed to.
It seems that early in 1M14 tfraa-
shaw had agreed to deliver a deed for
his farm to Miles, having Miles ot
take over a 3100 mortgage on the
farm and allow Bradshaw a mort
gge of the remainder of ? 5,000,
which Miles was to pay for the farm.
Each agreed to those terms aud on
March 1 of that year they wtre to
get together and make the formal
transfer. If either were to back out
of the deal he was to pay the other

It happened that March 1 fell on
Sunday and on the following day
Bradshaw testified that he looked for
Miles an dMlles testified that he look
ed for Bradshaw. A few days later
Bradshaw sold his farm to an uncle
and then he went to Miles and told
him that the farm aws sold. Miles

A week ago yesterday a meeting of
he executive committee of the
Wayne Highway was held In Colum
bus. At the meeting there were for
ty men present, and four of them
were from Mercer county.
in tne morning tne members me
and discussed means and methods of
marking the new highway from Ham
ilton to Toledo, also taking up some
other details In connection with the
highway.
In the afternoon the committee
met the governor In his olllce in the
effort to have the Wayne Highway
designated as a main market road
After hearing the appliction of the
committee and the arguments of the
members he promised his support
The western tier of counties have
a Just right to have this road made
a main market road on account of
the fact that It would serve to con
nect these counties and also make a
terminus for the east and west main
market roads.
Ihe committee then went to the
State Highway Commissioner Cow
en, at (Irst he did not sanction the
movement but finally agreed to ex
tend his support. So there seems to
be little dilllculty in having the
Wayne Highway designated as a
main market road.
After the recommendation by the
dovernor then all that Is necessary
is ror the state Highway Department
to grant the application.
The benefit derived from having
the highway made a main market
road is that is will then be eligible
for the state aid. Seventy-live per
cent of the money collected by the
state from the sale of motor vehicle
tags is returned to the counties and
the other twenty-five per cent. Is us
ed for the improvement of main mar
Ket roaas. i nis money each year
may be apportioned among all the
main roads or may all be spent on a
single road. Then after the road has
once been built the state maintains
it.
The designation of the Wayne
Highway as a main market road will
be abig benefit to Celina and Mercer
county, as the road crosses from the
south to the north through the cen
tral part of the county, touching this
city, and a long stretch of the coun
ty's roads will be eligible to state
aid, while otherwise it could not be.

SEED CORN ADVERTISING AV1LL
1'AY
Home grown seed corn, repeatedly
found "best by test" will be one of
the most sought-for farm commodi
ties next spring. Those who have
high grade seed corn for sale in fair
ly large quantities should let others
know about it. Otherwise seed tak
en by taith from other regions may
be planted and ont only the indivi
dual but also the community will suf
fer. Advertisements of seed corn in
the home paper, however modest, will
surely bring results because they will
likely reach the men who will be the
most likely customers. If the farm
er has high-class seed corn his ad
vertisements will add to his reputa
tion as a good farmer and business
man and at the same time confer a
benefit upon the c-iMmunitj.
