A WORD TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL
CHILDREN.
After we have passed from our
graded schools into our various high
schools there is a certain behavior
decorum and civility while at school
and in public, in fact wherever we
may go that we must nbserve and
adhere to, even though our parents
have neglected to tell us or admon
ish us to behave ourselves, and not
wait for our teacher or professor to
tell or remind us of our duty. I have
been informed that here in &ne of our
high schools (and what is true of
Des Moines may be true of other
high schools where there are many
attending), that the colored children
congregated together become boister
ous, noisy, with loud talking and
laughing and acting ridiculous. This
should be stopped. You high school
children should not segregate your
selves* off and become ludicrous for
your fellow white schoolmate. Be
young men and girls of a genteel
high ideal, mixing with every other
student, thereby reflecting credit and
character on our race. Parents,
speak to your children and caution
th,ejn, a.bout those things
.-J*"'." ©t''
X^UT CHAtiltfy.
Many are in need, because of sick
ness, and some of our charity, work
ers are giving relief. Let us not
quarrel as to "who does it!" but rath
ei dn our share to relieve the needy.

DES MOINES, IOWA, IPKIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1916.
Let us recognise the woric of the
charitable clube, and .pay less atten
tion to these over-nlghti reformers,
who have recently transferred their
financial activities from thieving in
the underworld, to misappropriating
the proceeds of suppers, chnrdi col
lections and other revenues intended
for charity who parade among the
needy in their purple and fine linen,
and thrive for a while on their ill
gotten gains. .These gay deceivers
would not dare don the simple garb
of the humble mission worker, or
Sister of Charity. Mary Magdalene
is a worthy example of reform, be
cause she obeyed the injunction, "Go
in peace! and sib no more." But we
accept,spasmodic and unreliable re
formers, and place them on a pin
nacle of prominence In our chuzdiea
^s emblems of purity when there
has been no actual reform. Once
recognised they represent them
selves as leaders, (and drive away
some nf the older members) when
tbey should be humble followers un
til they have stood tie proper tort,
in spite of this, those who are do
ing good will reap their reward and.
the hustlers will alsareap what they
have sown.—Twin City Star, Minne

SAWYER FOR MUNICIPAL
JUDGE.
Public offices, and especially the
judiciary, are f«r tfce public good
and not for the #dvaiceoent or pri-
duty™of every citiien to work and
vote for those candidates whom he
believes to be best fitted for the of
fice, and any one who asks or gives
support for any other reason is
neither patriotic nor loyal.
Therefore I offer myself as a can
didate for municipal judge. I am
not so concerned about being elected
as I am that the best available men
be chosen- I want no one to vote for
me unless he believes that I am one
of those best fitted to. fill the office.
I could not and would not buy the
office whatever time and money I
spend will be to arouse the people to
choose discriminatingly the best
among the candidates more than for
my own election. If, after investiga
tion, the people of Des Moines feel
that I can serve them as municipal
judge, I promise to do my conscien
tious best.
