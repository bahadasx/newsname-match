IiEltl.IN, Feb. 4. German officials
and German newspapers are unar.i
mous in the expression of the opinion
that unless the United States govern
ment waives the demard for disa
vowal of the sinking of the Lusitania
or agrees to submit tha question to
The Hague tribunal, an amicable
adjustment of the controversy be
tween Germany and America is im
possible. The Lokal Anzeiger says Germany
has done herutmost to prove her
friendship for America, but that she
cannot admit that the sinking of the
Lusitania was in violation of inter
national law.
Officials here in endorsing this
view, cvpr'.es the hope that Colonel
Mouse, who recently visited Berlin as
the personal representative ot Presi
uent Wilson, will be ab!o to presenc
the German view to the president so
correctly that a settlement will be

H. S. STUDENTS MAKE A
HIT IN "GIRL
High school taler.t produced, in the
high school auditorium last night, the
"Girl From Oklahoma" to a large and
appreciative audience.
The parts were well played, tho
acts well staged, the characters thor
oughly rehearsed and every amateur
perfect in his lines.
The following is the cast of char
acters: Miss Josephine Pool, Kobiu
Weatherford, a typical American girl:
Miss Claire Woodson, Priscilla Pea-
1 bodv, a'int of Robin Weatherford, who
is anxious to sen her niece married to
an Fngliah nobleman; Miss Alberta 1
Smith, Lady Violet Beauchamp, hos
tess to the American family; Miss
Clarice Tatman, Ethel Osbourne, rival
of Kobin Weatherford; Mr. Arthur
Griffin, Henry Weatherford, repre
sentative westerner cf great wealth
and father of Robin; Mr. Edwin Pool,
Sir Blakesley Bertford, nobleman,
owner of a title and a multiplicity o.'
debts, anxious to marry an American
heiress; Mr. Norman Duncan, Archer
Winthrop, a civil engineer, with plenty
of "pep" and a brilliant future, great
ly disliked by "Aunt Priscilla" and
prime favorite with Pere Weather
ford; Mr. Dewey Luster, Geoffrey
Carlyle., an English gentleman; Mr.
Earnest Raspberry, Wilson, the but
ler. The play was in fovr acts, each art
replete with thrilling denouments, the
last closing with the climax of "Mar
lied at Last to the Right Man."
As an American heiress whose hnnd (
was sought bv the impecuious scion !
of an old family and an empty title,
Miss Pool showed rare histrionic abil
ity and played well up to the situa
tion to the last moment, when her
father's fortune, having vanished the
impecunious lordling broke tho en

the man of her choice. Miss Wood-ling

Rises from Plight of Pauper Boy
to Position of King's Privy
Councillor
COMPELLED TO DON
TOGGERY OF COURT
Wife Takes Hand in Dressing Him; First
Elected Mayor of London Suburb
and Then is Sent to Parlia

By WILBER S. FORREST.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Feb. i England's most
Abraham Lincolnesque figure is in
the limelight. From the poor house
to membership in the king's most
honorable privy council is but part
of the record of Will Crooks, labor
member of parliament and champion
of the common people..
On the front doorstep of a modest
little cottage in Poplar, a London sub
urb, on New Year's day, a figure in
shirt sleeves, colored shirt sleeves at
that, stood greeting proud townsfolk
come to congratulate him. Messen
ger boys brought telegrams in batches
and handed them direct to the only
Britisher of the "masses" admitted to
the king's inner council and privileged
to bear the title of Right Honorable.
Inside the cottage, 'While Crooks
did the honors on the doorstep, wai
Mrs. Crooks, a plump, wholesome
English housewife, preparing the New
Tear's dinner. There ere no frilto
or "swank" in the home of the kings
latest privy councillor. That is why
Mrs. Crooks was in the kitchen while
Will, as he is known both in Poplar
and parliament, was assuring his
friends on the doorstep that being a
Right Honorable made him feel n-:i
different.
"There's one thing I want to say,"
he told them all. "Because the king
has deemed fit to call me his right
trusty and well beloved or whatever
the phrase is, I'm not going to become
a party man 1 11 be right with the
workers. Tell them that the position
gives me more power to work for
them. I live with them and hope to
, die with them."
When the voters elected Crooks
mayor of Poplar in li)01 he made a
record that pleased the folk who had
elected him over a more aristocratic
opponent. He w-ore the traditional
robes of office because Mrs. Crooks
told him to and not because he want
ed to. That is also why he's oinp
to wear the elaborate court dress that
is incumbent on a privy councillor.
"If they say Wil's got to wear court
togs, he's got to, that's all there Is
to it," said Mrs. Croon-i. "Leave It
to me. I'll see that he gets them. It
was the same when he became mayor
of Poplar. He wasn't going to wear
the robes, but I made him."
When the workers of Poplar re
v iewed Crook's record as mayor In
i','01, they immediately bean to boost
him for parliament in the Woolwich
district of which Poplar is part. He
wer.t to commons with an overwhelm
ing majority and he's still there.
Fighting the battles of the common
folks, the appearance of this medium
sized labor M. P. with his flashing
blue eyes and iron grey beard on the
floor of the house of commons, has
long since, 1903, ceased to be a joke.
Much credit for the strength of labor
in England today goes to the "ordi
nary pauper boy" who dared to call a
spade a spade while surrounded by his
upper class colleagues.
The story of Garfieid's boyhood
clays on the towpath; Lincoln's rail
splitting and grocery clerk life or Ben
Franklin's last penny for a bun In
Philadelph'a, do not outdo the boy
hood vicissitudes of King George's
