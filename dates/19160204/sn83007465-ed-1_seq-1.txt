10,000 Watch For Him.
Kansas City, Mo., Feb 2.?
President Wilson demanded tonight
that steps be begun during
the present month to back him
up in defending American lives
and commerce abroad." His demand
met with shouts and applause
from an audience of 16,000
persons who waved American
flags, leaped to their seats
and cheered.
When the president ceased
speaking he leaned forward and
asked the great throng to join
him in singing "America." The
band played softly, the audience
stood and the words of the patriotic
anthem came in a glori- [
u. a. ~c
tins uursi ui sung.
The big crowd was for the'
president from the start. It
waited patiently an hour to see
him and cheered itself hoarse in
a three-minute demonstration
when he appeared. Sixteen thousand
heard him; 20.000 were
turned away and 10,000 more
tried to glimpse him as he left1
his hotel for the hall.
"Why. some men in Washington
are questioning if we could
get the 500,000 men for which
the government is asking." he. i
said, at one point of h s address.
"Would they volunteer?"
A man in the far end of the
hall shouted "yes" and others
echoed the word until, the hall

"Why. I > -v, ve." the president
said "ymi re dd raise the |
500,000 men in almost, any elate.

who say the United States ;s no* ;

goods"?the crowd cheered.
"Don't miissunder tnrd we {V ->v
are going to deliver the goods
because you want the goods do
. livered.
"I have come to ask you what
is back of me in this task of
preserving at one peace and your
honor," the president said. "The
iudge on the bench has the l^w
back of him with its bailiffs,
sheriffs, National guardsmen
and the United States army, if
you ignore hi bome foreign capital
what the president urges as
the rights of the people and government
of the United States,
what is there back of it?
"It is necessary that I should
come and ask you this question
because I don't know how Ion"the
mere word and insistence of
your government will prevail to
maintain your honor and the
aignity and power of the nation.
"There may come a time?T
nray God it may never come, but
it may in spite of everything we
do?upon us when I shall have to
ask, T have said my say, who
stands back of it? Where is
that force by which the right
and majesty of the United
States are to be vindicated and
asserted ?"
?The president deelnrpH v?oi
need was immediate and that action
should be beffun within the
present month.
"I assure you there is not \
day to be lost," he said. "Not because
there is any snecial crises
but because T do not know 2*
( hours ahead what will happen. 1
"The future does not depend]
on us, but upon commanders;1
of shins and of submarines and j
upon blockades and upon many''
other men, biff and little."
The president presented a 1

without success. The only change
in any of the items considered to
