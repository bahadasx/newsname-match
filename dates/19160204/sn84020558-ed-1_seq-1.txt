A Zeppelin airship and probably all

off the coast of Holland. This air
ship, according to an Amsterdam re

Thirteen of the crew of the collier
Franz Fischer were drowt.ed when
the collier was sent to the bottom ia
two minutes by a bomb dropped by
one of the Zeppelins returning from
the raid made on .England. Only
three men of the Fischer were saved.
Heavy bombardments are in pro
reus at various points along the west
ern line, especially in the region of
l.oos, h.ld by the British, and around
Neuville, where the Germans recently
captured French positions. The Brit

around Hulluch. Near the Bois De

put tlown a German attack against
their trenches.
There is comparative quiet on the

Unofficial advices say that floods

Along the Italian-Austrian front
hravyi artillery duels continue. A dis

an encounter between Bulgarians and

junction of the Greek-Serbian-Bulgarian
frontiers, in which the entente
allies repulsed the Bulgarians.
News is lacking concerning the op

(Republican A. P. Leased Wire.)
OTTAWA, Feb. 4. The historic Canadian parliament
building was destroyed last 'night by a fire declared unof
ficially to have been caused by the explosion of a gas bomb
or an infernal machine. Two women, guests of the wife of
Speaker Sevigny, were overcome by smoke and perished.
Several policemen and firemen were buried under the de
bris when one end of the building collapsed.
.The number of persons taken to hospitals had not been
determined early this morning. Frederick F. Pardee,
chief liberal whip, and William S. Loggie, a member of
parliament from New Brunswick, are missing and it is be
lieved they have lost their lives.
Two dominion policemen and two commons attendants
who, working with other men in the chamber below the
speaker's quarters. when the roof fell, are declared to have
been killed. The main tower fell at 1 :30 o'clock this morn
ing. It was believed at that hour there was slight hope of
saving the library.
It has been e' tablished that the first burst of flames in
the reading re m of the house of commons was preceded
by at least one explosion and probably by two. The force
of the concussion hurled persons standing some distance
away to the floor. A rigid investigation to determine the
cause of the fire already has been undertaken by the do
minion authorities.
The flames spread with such amaz
ing rapidity that the Ottawa fire bri
gade was helpless to cope with them.
Aid was sent from Montreal on a spe
cial tr.iin but at l o'clock this morning
the fire still was raging. '
The
mf.ney
loss cannot be estimated in
The building was valued at
about $ri.nno,ono. But the contents are
of inestimable value. There was no
insurance.
At midnight the commons and sen
ate chambers had been destroyed and
as the grent clock boomed out the
hour, flames were climbing up the
magnificent tower and licking their
way to its top. The parliamentary lib- j
rary at the rear, probably will be saved.
Soldiers were assigned to carry out its
contents.
Members of the parliament, specta
tors in the gallery of the lower house,
government employes and other nar
rowly escaped death or injury. Within
a few minutes after the fire began,
corridors were filled with smoke and at
many points walls of fame barred
progress. There were many doors to
the great building, but since the out
break of the war, all except the main
portals have been closed to safeguard
the exchequer. This precaution prob
ably was responsible for the deaths of
I line. Brayy of Montreal and Mme. Mo.
i rin of Beauce in one of the rooms of
the speaker's suite.
Mme. Sevingy saved her two children
by diopping them into a firemen's
safety net and then leaped to safety
'herself. Another of her guests, Mme.
Dussault, saved herself in the same
way.
Jmong those severely burned was
Minister of Agriculture Burrell, who
fell unconscious after plunging through
a curtain of fire and groping his way
along a smoke filled corridor. Dr.
I Michael Clark, member from Red Deer,
wa slightly burned.
. An unidentified woman iumned from
the second story of the building and
was severely injured. Several persons
were overcome with smcke. Sir Robert
Borden,' the premier escaped safely.
Part of the roof over the reading
' room and chamber collapsed soon after
the fire was discovered. The leading
room is situated at the northeastern
corner of common chamber.
The entire fire fighting equipment of
Ottawa was unable to cope with the
flames and Mayor Martin of Montreal
was largely responsible for the de
sign of the building.
The central building, which had two
wings, was 470 feet in length and had.
a- tower 220 feet high. To the rear of
1 ,ne csnuai mincing was the library ot
parliament, a polygonal structure with
a dome. Tie senate chamber was tp
the right of the entrance and the
house of commons to the left. Stone
carvings and paintings of
Canadians embellished the
corridors. . The library contained more
than 200,000 volumes.
The buildings covered an area of
more than four acres, on what is
konwn as parliament hill.
I a member of parliament, at 10 o'clock
j ordered the Montreal fire brigade to
j this city. At half past eight, half an
hour after the fire was discovered, the

handsome Gothic structure was
: doomed.
' The fire spread with such rapidity
tilat the belief was expressed by offi
I cials that it was of incendiary origin.
' When Speaker Sevingy took the chair
ani opened the session of the house at
8 o'clock only about fifty memoirs
were
latin;
in their seats. A discussion re
to fisheries was proceeding
when a messenger rushed into the
room shouting "Fire; Run for your
lives." ,
The members were driven back by
smoke and flames when they sought
a.i exit through the two main doors
and spectators in the gallery, panic
stricken, stampeded for the exits.
Minister of Agriculture Burrell was
overcome by the smoke and fell just in
front, of the postoffice. He was picked
up and carried out by Robert Rogers
minister of public works; J. O. Reid,
minister of customs and Pierre Blow
din, secretary of state. It was found
that while his injuries were serious he
will recover.
One of the first men to make his
wav out of tile chamber was Colonel
John Currie, who commanded the
Fourth Regiment of the Canadian first
division through the battle of St. Ju

ruled that testimony should be limited
to that concerning alleged undue in

ond will shall not be entertained. The
contest involves half a million dollars
and Mrs. Lillian Beale, the widow, is
the defendant. Arthur K. Stearns of
c nicago, a nepnew ot Air. Beale was

show that he was not permitted to see
his uncle through influence exercised

Republican. A. P. Leased Wire
ON BOARD PRESIDENT AVIL
SO.VS SPECIAL TRAIN, INDIAN
APOLIS, Ind., Feb. 3 President Wil
son was speeding back to Washington
tonight convinced that the people of
the middle- west are with him on the
issue of national defense and are pre
pared to insist that congress take
speedy action. He finished his speak
ing tour in St. Louis today and ex
pressed the conviction that his mission
had succeeded beyond his greatest
hopes. He will arrive in Washington
at 1 p. m tomorrow.
When the president's train reached
Indianapolis at 5:45 p. m. for a five
minute stop, a large crowd greeted
him at the station. When cries were
made for a speech, he appeared on the
platform of his car and said "Indiana
is all right." The crowd then shouted
for Mrs. Wilson, but the president told
them she was resting and she did not
appear. Members of the Indiana dem
ocratic club sent Mrs. Wilson a large
bunch of American beauty roses.
President Wilson's advisers believe
he has explained clearly why he con
siders immediate preparedness impera
tive has won many converts to the
movement and has given new impetus
to a discussion of the cause.
From the sympatheitc attitude of most
of his audiences, from the enthusiasm
his every appearance in public has
evoked, from the huge crowds which
have greeted him they have drawn the
conclusion that the people overwhelm
ingly support his plan at leapt in the
middle west.
The president's official family want
him to start soon on another tour.
Some of them liken his swing through
the middle west to an operation not
yet completed. Enroute to Washing
ton tonight they looked both south and
west for he setting of his next appear
ance in the role of champion of nation
al preparedness.
The south beckoned with many
hands. Senators and representatives
ftom most of the southern states al- !
ready have isked him to include their
sections on his next tour. To this have i
been added invitations from many pub
lic bodies with Texas strongly assert
ing her claims. There is feeling
among somj of his intimate advisers
that in choosing the scene for his next
plea to the people, the president could
pay no greater compliment to his own
political party than by going into its
stronghold. '
The west pnd northwest, or at least
that section of the country that fringes
the eastern slopes of the Rocky Moun -tains,
are hardly less, insistent that the
president's next visit shall be to them.
Minneapolis. St. Paul and Denver have
presented what they consider strong
claims and it is known that a trip to
these cities is receiving careful consid
eration. It is possible that if the pres
ident makes another preparedness tour
it may be a combination of the two a
swing to the northwest, including Min
neapolis or St. Paul, or both

and then south into Texas, possibly re
turning by way of New Orleans, Birm

has been decided concerning this.

NEWPORT NEWS. Va., Feb. 3.
Ninetcn days of ceaseless vigil for the
shirt handed German prize crew
aboard the former British liner Appam
ended late tonight when the last of
more than four hundred British pris
oners climbed over the ship's side to
liberty on the American soil. For the
first time since Lieutenant Berg and
his 22 men boarded the liner from the
raider which captured her on the night
of January 15, most of the Germans
slept peacefully with but a few of
the number on watch.
All British subjects and the one na
tionalized American, G. A. Tagliaferro,
quit the ship, leaving the prize com
mander with his crew and the 20 Ger
mans who had been made prisoners on
the Appam, including three women.
Captain Harrison and the Appam's
Fritish crew left their vessel only
after a sharp controversy between
agents of the owners, the Elder Demp
ster Company and the British embassy
at Washington. The company desired
its men to remain on the liner to sup
port the claims, that the Germans for
feited their prize by remaining in
neutral waters, but the embassy in
sisted, that every British subject de

time during the war, and even might

American sailing ship William P. Frye.
sunk a year ago by the German com
merce raider Prinz Kitel Friedericn.
The Frye case is on the eve of settle
ment, practically on the terms for
which the United States contends.
British officials go so far as to
charge that the Appam was brought
to Hamilton Roads for the deliberate
purpose of testing the soundness of
Germany's original contention that the
sinking of prizes is a necessary inci
dent to naval warfare in its present
form.
To offset that contention however,
is the German claim that the Prussian -American
treaty guarantees the prize
safe to her captors.
American officials realize that the
Appam presents the case of a prize
taken, with great difficulty and risk of
the captors, to the nearest accessible
neutral port. They recognize that
should the United States return her
to her British owners, that fact might
be made an argument for sinking cap
tured merchantmen.
One further result which threatens
to confront the United States should
it decide to recognize The Hague con
vention instead of the Prussian-American
treaty, isvthat Germany might
consider herself thus relieved from the
treaty obligations the United States is
contending to enforce. Such a de
