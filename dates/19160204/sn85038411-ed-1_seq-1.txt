Ottawa, Feb. 4.—Two women and
three men are known to have per
ished in the fire which swept through
the central portion of Canada's mag
nificent Parliment Building last night,
destroying the Chambers of the Com
mons and Senate. Several others are
reported missing and it is feared they
are buried In the ruins.
All night long firemen, police and
soldiers fought to save the $6,000,000
structure, which is considered one of
tlie finest examples of Gothic archi
tecture on this continent. They were
successful in saving the beautiful
library building and the east and west
wings of the main edifice.
Ruinor of I tomb.
Immediately after the fire started a
report was spread broadcast that it
was caused by the explosion of an in
cendiary bomb. The fire started In
Ibe readingrooni of the House of
< 'ommons and several percons who
were present at the lime including
Mayor Medric Martinfi of Montreal
asserted that it was preceded by ex
plosion which knocked down several
persons. The bomb theory was, how
ever, rejected to-day by Col. Sherwood
commissioner of Dominion police, who
insisted that the conflagration was
accidental.
The two women who lost their lives
were Mme. Bray, wife of H. A. Bray,
of Quebec, and Mme. Morin, wife of
Louis Morin, of Beauce, Quebec. The
men, whose bodies are still buried in
the debris, are Alphonse Des Jardins.

Among those reported missing is
B. B. Law, a member of Parliment for
Yarmouth, N. S. Mr. Law is under
stood to have been at the House at
the time the fire broke out and has
not been seen sinoe. He was alone in
the city and the management of the

left there last night to go to the House
and that every effort to trace him since
had failed.

to provide a complete new system of
secret communication for the navy.

Von Bernstorff Issues
Denial; Dr. Hale Is Head
of Embargo Conference
Washington, Feb. 4. Ambassador
Von Bernstorff, it was declared last
night at the German embassy, had
made no subscription to the American
Embargo Conference. Ambassador
Von Bernstorff declined to say any
thing about the subject. The impres
sion here is that the association has
been financed by German citizens in
| this country.
The Rev. Dr. William Bayard Hale,
| once confidential adviser of President
Wilson and the special representative
| of this Government in 1913 in Mexico,
expenses for which mission were
drawn from the State Department's
j secret fund, is exposed as a confiden
tial agent of fount Von Bernstorff.
| In this new role Doctor Hale is shown
i as chairman of the. American Embargo

! which displaced Labor's National

early Wednesday morning in the
North sea he saw the Zeppelin L-19
with her boats and a portion of her
envelope submerged. He noticed from
17 to 20 members of the crew cling

They asked to be taken off but as
the men on the Zeppelin outnumbered
the trawler's crew the skipper ile
clined to accede to the request. In

New York, Feb. 4.—Six women lost
I their lives in a fire which destroyed j
! the home of Mrs. Casimir Tag at 243 ]
Hancock street, Brooklyn, early to-day. j
i The dead are:

' Tag. the daughters of the late bank

old. a cousin of Mrs. Tag; Jennie
1 Stebman, a nurse ,and Anna Cain and
Lizzie Cain, servants.
The fire, which began in a partition
on the lower floor of the four-story
house, is attributed to defective in
sulation of wires. Miss Caroline Tag
was awakened by smoke and discov
ered the fire about 3 o'clock this morn
ing. Hastening to the telephone, she
notified her brother, who lived in an
adjoining house, and then telephoned
to the fire department. As she gave
the address of her home to the operator
at fire headquarters she said: "I am j
being overcome by smoke."
Rescuer Meets Death
Miss Tag awakened her mother, who 1
is 60 years old, and ained her to escape j
| through a third-story window to the
roof of an extension In the rear of the
j house. Apparently Miss Tag then went
I to the rooms of her sister and the

the flames and smoke which filled the

When the national real estate execu

Shreiner, member of the City Plan

he jumped at the chance.
The scores of real estate men from
Western Pennsylvania and the Middle
Western States had crowded to the
windows and observation platforms to
view the receding city and the
smoothly flowing Susquehanna. As the

Try to Dynamite Levee
to Divert Arkansas Flood
Little Hock Ark., Feb. 4.—investi
gation was being made to-day in the
futile attempt last night to dynamite
j the government levee at Pine Bluff
which if it had succeded would have
diverted the course of the Arkansas
I river many miles from the site of the
I town.
With the water slowly rolling into
the lower reaches of the Arkansas
the suffering in the flooded areas is
becoming intense. Hundreds of per
sons have been driven from home,
thinly clad and unused to the extreme
cold of the last week. Relief work I
can proceed only slowly as few fa- i
cilities exist to prov ide succor and the
towns In the flood area virtually arei
isolated. The flood's death toll to-day

AUSTRIAN AIRMEN
IN DARING RAID
ON ALLIED BASE
Shower Bombs Down on Dur
azzo and Aviona; Huss
Attack From Air
Notable success for its airmen in 1
raids on tlie Albanian port of Dura-1
y.xo is reported by the Austrian admir
ality. Three attacus by air on this
important allied base between Jan
uary 25 and February 1 are recorded. !
The Italian base at Avlona. Albania, »
also was attacked by Austrian aviators '
on Feb 2.
The eastern war theater, like the
western and the Balkan, has in recent
days been the scene of the numerous
aerial operations. Vienna reports the
bombardment of Buczacz in Gallcia
by a Russian air squadron and Russiuni
raids further north, in Volliynla while
the Austrian airmen appear to have
been equally active.
A second Zeppelin air raid on Sa
lonika attempted on Wednesday, was
frustrated by the fire of the allied
batteries, according to an Athens dis
patch.
Reports of infantry operations of
.importance from any of the main war
| fronts are lacking. Vienna claims
progress for the Austrians at the Tol
mino bridge head by sapping optra
tions.
A similar operation enabled the
British to destroy one of the mine
\ craters near Huluch on the French
[front, recently occupied by the Ger
i mans.
Artillery activity along the western
battle !ine shows no signs of lessen
ing Indeed, Berlin to-day reports the
allied tiro increasing in intensity. The
Argonne is now named as one of the
; sectors where the big guns are most
! persistently pounding the German
lines.
Paris also records considerable
artillery activity, but mentions only
the Vosges as the scene of it. Only
hand grenade engagements are re
ported near Neuville where the
mans appear to be holding tenaciously
to the groiind recently won from the
French.

Impossible to Understand

Athens, Feb. 2, via London, Feb. 4.
—"There is not any way to tell you so
that you would understand the awful
horror of the things that 1 have seen
and lived in the last month," said
Marie Lemos, of Irving Park, Chicago,

vived the sinking of the Italian steam
ship Brindisi which recently struck a
mine in the Adriatic. She continued:
"The hideous rapidity of the sink

NEW LUSITANIA
I CRISIS RAISED BY i
TERM "ILLEGAL"
Germany Will Not Disavow

stances in Concessions
SITUATION IS SERIOUS
No Other Difficulties Remain
in Way of Satisfactory
Settlement
By Associated Press
j Berlin, Feb. 4, via London. 12:20 j
j P. M. —Information reaching the As- |
jdociatetf Preuc to-Uuy indicates that
-' under no circumstances wlfi Oermwiy |
! i admit the sinking of the Lusitania was j
I an illegal act.
The new instructions forwarded to I
|! Ambassador Von Bernstorff, accord-'
' j ing to this information, contains sim- !
i ply one phrase of the new formula
, j tion of the proposed note of regret ]
for the sinking of the Rusitania. The
" j suggested sentence is short, consisting
' | of only eight words and does not con
■ tain the word "illegal." It represents
■ the extreme limit of Germany's con
cessions in the Lusitania case.
> The view is entertained here that
! one of the most serious crises of the
i war has arisen in connection with
• the Rusitania case and that it is Im
possible to foresee the outcome from
i any indications here. The result of
• the negotiations appears to hinge
i solely on the one word "illegal."
Seven Letters Raise Crisis

1 | stand only these seven letters, express
ing the conception which President

' must be embodied in the German for

' American lives aboard the Cunardcr.
' The Associated Press is informed posi
[ tively and authoritatively that Ger
! many cannot and will not designate as
il'egal the sinking of a liner by any
submarine.
Virtually no other difficulties in the
5 way of settlement remain, and the
1 new instructions forwarded to Am

! contain merely the now formula by.

Although the suggested sentence, ac
