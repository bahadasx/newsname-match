VOLUME XXVIII
PULLMAN MAY LAND
BIG PYTHIAN MEET
Some Lodge in Whitman County Will
He Host to Hundreds of Knights
of Pythias From All Parts
of Inland Kirn pi
Evening Star lodge, No. 20,
Knights of Pythias, will make a
strenuous effort to secure for Pull
man one of the biggest meetings of
members of the order of Knights of
Pythias to be held In the state dur
ing the year, a meeting that will be
featured by an initiation that will
add over 100 names to the county
Pythian roll, and that will draw
members of the order from all parts
of the Inland Empire, with probable
special trains from Spokane ana
Colfax.
The big gathering will be one of
the three "Bible Classes" allotted to
the state of Washington, and the
candidates for initiation, over 100
of them, will take their obligation
over the same Bible that Justus H.
Rathbone, founder of the order,
used to obligate his first members
ever 50 years, ago. This famous
Bible is never allowed to leava the
possession of Fred E. Wheaton of
Minneapolis, supreme keeper of rec
ords and seal, and Mr. Wheaton,
himself one of the greatest Pythians
of today, will have charge of the
unusual ceremony.
In the interests of the meeting
Grand Keeper of Records and Seal
H. M. Love of Colfax, accompanied
by R. C. McCroskey of Garfield, su
preme delegate, and A. R. Met/, and
Judge Thos. .Will of Colfax, both
officers of the grand lodge, and J.
J. Klmm of Colfax, visited the local
ledge. Mr. Love has charge of the
placing of the three stale classes,
and offered one meeting• to Whit
man county in case the various
lodges of the county will pledge 100
candidates, the meeting to go to the
lodge that presents the greatest
number of candidates by April 1,
about two weeks before the meeting.
Evening Star lodge promised half
that number of aspirants for initia
tion, and will bend every effort to
bring the big meeting to Pullman.
. It will undoubtedly be one of the
biggest Pythian meetings ever held
in the state, and should the Pullman
members of the order .realize their
hopes, Pullman will be honored with
one of the most compreheosize gath
erings that ever assembled here.
In connection with the visit of
the Colfax delegation to Pullman,
the Palouser had this to say:
On Monday night Grand Keeper
of Records and Seals Harry Love,
Auditor Met/., Judge Thos. Nelll and
J- J. Kimm visited the Pullman
lodge. The matter of a "Bible class"
was suggested to them and discus
sions of the proposition invited. And
the Pullman membership present at
that meeting left no doubt in the
minds of any as to what would be
the position of their lodge in the
matter. They very readily took up
with the idea and forthwith in
formed the gentlemen from Colfax
that Pullman expected to be the
scene of that "Bible class" initiation
and that the Pullman lodge would
be up and doing from now until the
time of the proposed visit of Mr.
Wheaton, straining every effort to
outdo the other lodges of the county
hi the matter of securing applica
tions.
The Pullman Knights are a live
bunch. They are hustlers and usu
ally get about what they start after,
and the Colfax lodge will have a con
test on their hands to bring the class
initiation to the county seat. Every
member of the order in Colfax
should get busy and do all he can to
help the local lodge win the honors.
The reward in sight justifies hard
*ork, and if the Colfax boys will go
into the matter with a determination
to win they are certain to give a
splendid account of themselves.
t But the contest of the honor of
holding the class initiation is by no
means certain of being confined to
the above two lodges. There are
other live and ambitious lodges In
the county that are very apt to make
their presence in the race a great
Jactor. Garfield, Rosalia. Tekoa,
Parmington and other points are In
wrested In the proposition already.

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4. 1916
! Bryan May Run for 11. S. Senate
[Spokane Paper Says Thai Friends of
Educator Are Feeling the
Republican Pulse
The Spokane Chronicle, in a recent
issue, published the following article
which will he of interest to the many
friends of Dr. E. A. Bryan in Pull

It is now really true— lull most

late president of Washington State
College, is changing his political atti

man who is a receptive candidate for
the United Slates senate.
Certain inspired friends of Mr.
Bryan, who Know how to do the job,
are expeditiously feeling out the re
publican party in the state, in a
fashion that makes it certain that
their efforts are fully authorized by
the man in whose behalf they are
made. Letters and personal visita

Dr. Caldwell went on to Puyallup,
Dayton and Walla Walla to stud)
evaporating plants In those places,

three weeks, ready to formulate

These evaporating plants will be

Two things .Mr. Bryan would like'
i' know, from the form the query
is takiug. First, is it true that there
la a largo fraction of the republican
party, a one-third fraction, say, that
is disposed to view unfavorably both
the progressive candidacy of Senator
.Miles Poindexter and the stalwart
candidacy of Senator of Congressman
W. G. Humphrey? Second, is E. a.
Bryan, carefully and Impersonally
considered, the man who can appeal
to this one-third fraction with a
chance of success, when aided by
friendship and personal Influence?
Should the returns from these' two
propositions be satisfactory, the edu
cator will take to this senatorial race
like a due to water.
Naturally the- process going on in
political channels in this matter has
attracted some attention. Congress
man Humphrey is already wigwag
ging frantic signals to his supporters
in eastern Washington, outlining tac
tics to lie adopted. Mr. Humphrey
would like somebody, several some
bodies, in fact, to tell Mr. Bryan that
he, Humphrey, loves him, Bryan, like
a brother; that there' are many other
things in politics besides a senatorial
nomination; that there are are lus-
clous cabinet posts to come if a re
publican administration takes office
next. year. Would Mr. Bryan like to
be secretary of agriculture? Sup
pose a new commissioner of educa
tion was to be chosen, would Mr.
Bryan like to be it? That nothing
would be too good for Mr. Bryan, if
only he wouldn't gum up the cards
this way and hamper the attempts of
Humphrey to settle the political hash
of the returning hull mooser who has
the senatorial title now.
This is one reason why there will
be an interesting campaign in this
state this fall. Humphrey, by a hard
year of political work, aided sub
roes by Senator W. L. Jones, has
lined up the republican organization
hard and fast all over this slat" to
support his ambition, but he knows
as well as anybody else that tying up
the leaders does not tie up the pri
mary vote.
possible for them to present not
only an oporatlc performance every
spring, but also an oratorio each
winter, for which the best soloists
in the country may be secured.
To this end, however, it is neces
sary for them to receive loyal sup
port, both morally and financially.
The program, which follows, will
consist of concerted works only, the
object being to afford variety in the
regular winter schedule of solo con
certs, lectures, etc.

northwestern apples has been made,
the capacity being about 200 bushels
of fruit per day.
"The thing we have In contempla
tion for the immediate future," said
Mr. Corbaley, "Is a study of such
driers as there are in the northwest
and a comparison of them and of
their product with the evaporators
of New York state, Which Dr. Cald
well has been studying recently. We 1
want to determine the per cent of |
shrinkage and the best varieties for
drying, and for this purpose tests
are to be made of fruit sent from
the Spokane district, from southern
Idaho and from other Washington
districts.
"When these studies have been
made Dr. Caldwell will prepare a

may be expected."

GROUND.HOG PROMISES
MODERATE WEATHER
The ground-hog emerged from his
hole Wednesday after a lengthy hi
bernation, shivered in the zero
weather, looked around for his
shadow, which he failed to locate,
then promised the shivering masses
of people relief from their long suf
fering. That, in itself, was cause
for general rejoicing, but the pesky
critter has failed ingloriously to
make good his promises and has lost
a goodly number of previous staunch
believers. However, the Infalllable
Hicks himself has predicted an early
break In the cold spell, and those
who are prone to accept the prog
nostications of weather prophets as
reliable' see another ray of hope.
■ ■
The story of the ground-hog see
ing his shadow on February 2 comes
to us from a very old superstition,
It. is believed the Scandinavians first
gave thought to it on their church
holiday, Candlemas, when the hedge
hog was supposed to wake up from
his long winter's nap. He would
crawl out of his hiding place and
look around. If the sun cast his
shadow on the ground he would get
scared and run back to his hole and
sleep for six more weeks, but if he
did not see his shadow he would
smile- right then and there on the
world and give the signal for spring
to begin. Hundreds of years ago the
< people believed in this and other
superstitions equally foolish. The
farmer would put his confidence in
the little animal and plant his seed
according to his staying or hiding.
