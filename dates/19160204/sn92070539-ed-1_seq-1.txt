SOLDIERS HAD FIRE
THURSDAY EVENING
Fire in Hay Corral does but
Little damage. "Prepared

The fact that the troops wore
prepared to tight tire saved the
goei-uinunt an expensive one
about 1 ().;!() Thursday evening
The lire started in a stack of
baled hay just east tif the troops'
stables. The sentry only a
short distance away discovered
it a luiost as soon as it started
and gavo the alarm by tiring his
rille. Fire call was sounded
by all trumjieters in euinp and
in throe minutes several hundred
men had arrived and made a
dangerous tire of little eonse
quenco. They attuetod vigorous y
with wet sacks and a bucket line
was quickly formed aim in less
than an hour the tlames .voru
completely checked.
If this lire had occurred be
fore the- troops prepared for (ire
the t OHUlt would have been far
different. The loss probably
did not amount to over 100.
The origin is supposed to be
hoboes. There wree hosts of
them around the stock yards at
the time of the tire and it is very
probablo that some of them had
been sleeping in the hay.
Interesting to Merchants
Who ran for the vice presiden

ran with Roosovult? Who served

Test your memory a little, at

It is important to remember
that less than lour years ago the
names of this running mates of

that these names appeared every

every one of :Jr,000 newspapers

Diversified Crops
Diversified crops, together
with the hog, cow and hen.
the salvation of dry fartr-crs inlfunrt to
New Mexico. Tills belief was
subscribed to by agricultural
experts and practical farmers,
gathered together at the Farm
ers' Congi ess held at the Agn
cultural College during the first
week in January. It is conceded
that the value of diversified
crops, and the hog, cow and hen
as mortgage litters and dividend
payors, is generally realized by
the people of the dry farming
sections of the state. It is pos
sible, however, that it is not
generally known that the service
of the entire stuff of teachers
and experts of the Agricultural
College and Experiment Station
are always at the disposal of the
farmers, who are invited to ask
by mall at any time for informa
tion, Instruction and advice
regarding any dithculty in con
nection with farm management,
crops, livestock, poultry, or anv
disease affecting grains, fruit or
livestock. Extensive expert

GRADE LEFT OPENi
Large Delegation calls on
Koad Board to protest
the movement to build thc
road around mountains
A large number of the busi
ness men of Columbus made a
trip by autos to Doming Tuesday
to hold a consultation with the
Luna county road commissioners
to protest against the proposed
ro.id from Deming to Columbus.
The old Grnde road, as it is
commonly known, is straight as
t ho ciow tiles from one town to
the other. It was graded for a
railroad at a large expense and
has been used as a public high
way for the last thirty yours.
During all this time there has
beon practically no work done on
it and in many places it is still a
good road. Of course there has
beon numbers of washouts and
In the gap a part of the Grade is
past using at all. With the ex
ceptlon of this one place, which
would have to be bridged, thisold
road could be put in good condi
tion with a small amount of work
and some culverts.
Thero is a state highway which
runs from Doming to a point
twelve miles due south. What
is needed Is a good road from the
county seat to Columbus. The
Grade would be practical
but it is learned that from the
gap north there is but one or
two settlers living on the road
until a point is reached up near
Doming, md at this place- there
is section line roads toaccommn
date those people. In opening
this road very few people north
of the gap would be served ex
cept the direct travel between
Deming and Columbus.
The Columbus idea is a good
road to Doming but build it in
the place where it will serve the
greatest number of settlers and
can be built at the least ossible
expense. Those things taken
into consideration the practical
solution of the question seems to
be to join the Grade and the
state highway, either by going
west from Mayflelds place to
Waterloo thence north, or by
keeping on the Grade to a point
due east of the south end of the
state road thence west. The
Columbus people favor tho form
er route because there is more
people tributary to it, although
it is about two miles the longer.
One or the other of these
routes seem to be the only sonsi
bles ones between the two
towns. Mr. Kelly, secretary
and treasurer of the road board,
favors tho Colum'aus loon. The
other member has an entirely
different idea.
As we understand his plnn it is
a continuation of the state road
south to a point in the Tres Her
manns mountains, k o o p i n g
around tho east side of tho moun
tnlns nnil comintr into tho Grade
a lmrt distance out from town.
This route would bo a very ox
pensive one for tho county in
the building anil also mainton-
nnco. nnd would he of no bonofit
whatsoever to tho largo number
of settlors in tho gap It would
probably enot twice as much as
tho other rond and exeludinp!
the direct travel would bonofit
no ono oxcopt a very few mining
in1" i" ' mountains, among
' whom is Dr. S. D. Swope, chair
, 'n of l,,p '"nn ootinty road
board, nnd the member who fa the now town well. The sooner

needed.
Columbus and tills end of the
valley have at least one third of
the population of - the county.
Our road commissioner. Chns.
Heath, lias not been an active
member for some time, probably
due to a misunderstanding be
tween the members. Mr. Heath
is tho senior member and was
no doubt entitled Ut more consid
oration than was given him.
The work on the Columbus
road has been IHd up until some
understanding can be reached
between the members of the
road board. Dr. Swope inform
cd the delegation that all work
would be stopped on this end of
the road until the state engineer
can get down here and go over
the prooscd routes and make a
recommendation, but we think
that it will be settled satisfacto
ry both to Deming and Columbus
as soon as our commissioner In
comes active, which event will
happen shortly, and the pies
enceof the state engineer will
not be necessary.

that made the trip to Deming
Tuesday were W. C. Hoover, .1
