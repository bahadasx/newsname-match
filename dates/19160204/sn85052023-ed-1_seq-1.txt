HOT TIMES IN
THE HOUSE
When Representative Greene Charges
Gov. Stanley Is Trying to Force
Members to Obey His Wishes
Developments in the legislature at
Frankfort this week have been rath
er interesting to an outsider.
Early in the week the bill to cre
ate the new county of Stanley was
tabled in the senate by a margin of
one vote, after certain Administration
leaders had exhausted every effort to
"put it over." Charges then sprung
up in the House that some crooked
-work was attempted, and a republi
can senator, Robert Antle, of Rus
sell county, gave out a statement
that a prominent democratic leader
had offered to guarantee .or post a
1,500 forfeit that "Uncle Bill" Al
len, of the Clinton-Wayne district,
whose seat was being contested by
S. C. Dobbs, democrat, would be
seated if Antle would vote to create
the new county of Stanley. Antle
declined to accept the covert bribe
and the House unseated "Uncle Bill"
and Antle told of the proferred deal,
-which will be investigated.
Representative Frank C. Greene,
of Carroll county, threw a bombshell
into the House also when he declared
on the floor of the house that Gov.
Stanley is trying to dictate to the
members of the house how they shall
vnfo TTo nnpnlv stated that Stanley
j took a member of the House to task
for voting favorably toward the bills
which are designed to close the sa-j
loons in Covington and Newport on
Sunday.
A feature of the sensational dis
closures in the house was that Rep
resentative George L. Pickett, of
Shelby county, in the debate on these
questions, defended Gov., Stanley and
the Administration. The Cincinnati
Enquirer's Frankfort correspondent
wrote the following concerning the
charges made : .. - - -
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 1. Charges
were made in the House of Represen
tatives by Repreesntarive Gre?ne of
Carrollton, that Gov. Stanley railed
s. member of the house into his of
fice and rebuked this member be
cause he had voted to take the Cov
ington and Newport Sunday closing
bills out of the hands of the Alcohol
ic Liquor committee and put them
in the calendar. Representative
Harvey declared that Gov. Stanley
had been corralling senators in, his
office .c induce them to vote as he
desired on measures.
These chares were preceded and
supplemented by denunciations of
Gov. Stanley equally as bitter. Rep
resentativee Pickett defended Gov.
Stanley by alluding to 'disorganiz
ers," and "anti-administrationists"
and ""politicians," who, he said, were
trying to disrupt the legislature.
"Evidently," said Representative
Greene, "the gentleman from Shelby
meant to refer to me when he spoke
of disorganizes. In reply I want to
ay that it is A. O. Stanley, the gov
ernor of Kentucky, who is disrupting
and disorganizing the legislature
not only in the house but in the sen
ate. It is Gov. Stanley who is trying
to frame and force legislation to car- i
ry out his pre-election promises. I am
still for the administration when it is
right but, God helping me, I will nev
er be for it when it is wrong."
The storm broke when Representa
tive Harvey arose to a point of per
sonal privilege and began to read a
newspaper article, which recited that
"some of the legislative 'bronchos'
seem to entirely oblivious of the fact
that they are riding to a fall." The
story dealt with those members of
the legislature who have not been in
harmony with the administration in
all of its measures. These members
it designated as "administration bait-
test is a coward."
Speaker Duffy declared Represen
tative Greene was out of order and
directed him to sit down.
Taking the floor again Representa
tive Harvey declared "Governor Stan
ley had corralled Senators into his
office to force them to stultify their
consciences by voting for measures
against the wishes of their constitu
ents." Representative Pickett arose to a
point of personal privilege. He was
recognized and began to speak. Rep
resentative Harvey called attention
to the fact that other members had

A luncheon or smoker is to be

Secretary Jay Howenstine,
of the association, is arranging the

senative Pickett to proceed, who Ham Severance will preside, and will
praised Governor Stanley and his ad
ministration. Without mentioning
any one by name, he condemned se
verely such "insui-gents" who seek
to "disorganize" and "disrupt" the
proceedings.
"In the name of God, gentlemen, I
ask you, let's drop this and get down
to work," was his concluding plea
for harmony.
Representative Greene demanded
that the names of the "disorganizers"
be disclosed, but the Speaker ruled
further debate out of order and made
all the members take their seats.

News comes from th West End
that petitions are being circulated
for another election in Lincoln coun
ty on the road bond question. It is
said that the petitions ask for an
election to be held on the question
of voting bonds to the amount of
5lKft.nnu to imi rove tile roads all

over tne
that the petitions are
ously signed, and it is believed thai
sufficient, number of names will be se
cured by court day, that the election
may be asked for, and called by the
County Court at its term on Feb
ruary 14th. Reports from the West
End say that many who were against
the road bond proposition have come
out strong for it now, since they
have seen the fearful conditions in
which the highways have gotten dur
ing the winter weather. The peti
tions are said to ask the calling of
the election as soon as possible after
the filing of same with the court,
which would make the date about the
first part of April. It is said that
those behind the movement in the
West End have appealed to friends
in other sections of the county to
start and have similar petitions
signed from all over the county.

discussion at this point, declaring that
every member of the House had as
much right to the floor as the Speak

"This article is an insult to every
member here," said Representative
Greene. "It says that unless they
