Jerome Day To Chicago
Boise Capital News: State Sena- !
[tor Jerome J. Day of Moscow will
be Idaho's representative to make
t; be t r j p Chicago to consult there of
with the syndicate behind a promi- j
|nent engineer on the closing of a
[contract financing the north and
south railroad. Negotiations carri- by
e d 0 n between Governor Alexander
Day as vieil as his
brother, Harry L. Day, the well
known mining man of Wallace, who of
is in the city assisting in closing up
the affairs of the Panama-Pacific
exposition commission of which he
and g enator
Senator Day and Aaron Par er of
Grangevdle, both members of the
nortb an( j sou th railroad commission,
would be asked to make the Chicago
was a member, resulted in the con
sent of Senator Day being secured.
He leaves for Chicago Tuesday.
It was announced yesterday that
trip in response 1o urgent telegrams
of
from the engin, er who made an in- .
spectil , n of the route last summer
for capitalists of eastern states. He
stated in his telegram that if the
state Could send a representative to
Chicago, he was pit pared to talk
business and close a contract for the
building ol the railroad.
A second telegram was received
by the governor irom this engineer
yesterday. It ib as loliowo:
"Chicago, lil ,Jan. 27, 1916.
"Governor Mooes Alexander:
"Yoursof today received. Please
wire Friday it possible when lepre
sentatives will an ivt, so 1 can make
definite appointment here. Also
have brought ail available data and
information, without delaying, how
ever, on that account."
That the mission of the Idaho
representative is one of paramount
importance is evident trom the tone
of the telegrams received. It is a
well-known tact that there is ample
capital in the east seeking ltgunate
investment and at that some oi mis
has been secured to finance the north
and south raiiroaa seems to ue quite'f
apparent.

War in High School—
Everywhere you read about the
war in Europe, but do not realize
that there is a desperate struggle
going on in your very midst. This
is a great struggle between intel
lect and ignorance. Although in
tellect is greatly out numbered by
ignorance, the war is being carried
on most vigerously. Intellect is
represented by Prof Best and ig
norance by the majority of his Ge
ometry class. Reports as to the re
sults of the battles are conflicting.
In the last reports the struggle is
becoming more desperate day by
day and it looks as though Prof.
Best will suffer a disasterous defeat
if he does not get the neuturals
"Home Study", "More Effort",
"Individual Study" to become his
Allies.
