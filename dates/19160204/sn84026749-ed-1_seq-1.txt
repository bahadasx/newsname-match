235 DRUGGISTS
HERE PROTEST
A 1
DISTRICT BILL
Say They Aren't Taking Sides in
Prohibition Fight, But At
tack Proposed Restriction of
Alcohol Sales.
Formal Communication and
Many Individual Letters Sent
to Legislators by Pharma
cists of Washington.
Washington's 235 wholesale and
id'tail druggists are sending pro
tests to Congressmen and Sena
tors against the Sheppard District
prohibition bill which they assert
would materially affect their busi
ness. The druggists wish it distinctly
understood that they are not tak
ing sides in the prohibition fight,
but they do protest against any
legislation which would restrict the
sale of grain, wood or denatured
alcohol to the drug trade.
One of ihe sections of the Shep
pard bill provides that only five
wholesale drug firms shall be
licensed to sell pure grain, wood
or denatured alcohol in the Dis
trict after November I. It further
.provides that ;tjiesQ. five whole
salers shall not sell more than five
gallons to any person at one time,
and that the purchaser must have
a permit from the District Com
missioners to buy the alcohol. The
price of this permit is fixed at 25
cents.
MANY PROTESTS.
t'nder the provisions of thin section
retail druggists would be put on .a plane
with individuals and be compelled to
obtain permits from the Commissioners
and pay for them.
Believing this section would hamper
their business, the retail druggists have
pent a formal protest to Congressmen
and Senators, and many Individual let
ters have been written to the legis
lators. The druggists state that they
are opposed to any provision In the
8hbpard bill which would restrict tho
salo of grain alcohol for pharmaceut
ical, scientific or mechanical purposes.
The wholesale druggists protest
against the provision requiring the pay
ment of a $25 license for the privilege
of dispensing alcohol. They also ob-
Ject to tho requirement of the Shep
pard bill that they exact affidavits of
purchasers of alcohol and keep an open
record of all such sales. Their opposi
tion is based solely on the restrictions
and Interferences which would affect
the drug trade.
The District of Columbia Retail Drug
Association, of which F. T. Stone Is
president and Charles J. Fuhrman sec
retary, will hold a meeting at the Col
lege of Pharmacy Tuesday night. Prcs-

OF LUSITANIA
Lansing Told German Language
Contains No Such Word and
None That Corresponds Ex
actly With Its Meaning.
Officials Declare That From
Standpoint of American Gov
ernment the Situation Is No
Less Grave.
Germany cannot "disavow" the
sinking of the Lusitania in express
terms, and the United States Gov
ernment has been so advised by
Count von Bernstorff.
The reason which has been
given to Secretary Lansing is that
there is no such word as "disa
vow" in the German language,
and none that corresponds exact
ly with its meaning.
While there is still hope in Ger
man circles that a settlement will
be reached, it is declared that the
problem for Berlin has been partly
one of getting an expression which
approaches that demanded bv tha
United States.
'tfO LESS GRAVE.
Although theXAjrd "disavow" Is con
tained Jn tho English translatipn of
Germany's jioto to tho United States on
the sinking of tho steamer Arabic, It
was learned today from the highest
authority that tho Stato Dvtment
haa never seen tho German translation
and docs not know what German word
was used.
On the eve of the arrival of the new
memorandum from Berlin, offlcaB let
It bo known today that from the stand
point of this Government tho situation
is "no less grave" than It was a week
ago. Although realizing the limitations
pf language, tho State Department let
It be known today that It had not
ii- cdta from its orl-inul demand fo
disavowal.
President Wilson returned to Wash
ington this afternoon to take charge
of the situation. For a week he has
been telling the people of the Middle
Nest that it Is Impossible for hlin to
predict what the morrow will bring
torth to endanger tho peaceful relations
of the I'nlted States with the rest of
the world. The question aa to whether
the new memorandum from Berlin la to
effect a settlement or cause a break
will be squarely before him within the
next twenty-four hours.
House Speeding Homeward.
The statement Is still made In Ger
man quarters that a diplomatic break
would mean war, sooner or later. Tho
German press, while still hoaeful or a
settlement, declares that If a breaK
comes "Germany will know how to
meet her new foe as stoutly as she has
met her old."

tlouse, tho President's personal emis

tis coming is being awaited with eag
erness In German quarters. Ther t
is suggested that If the present irego
nations fall through. Colonel House
will havo with him, straight rrom
chancellor Bethmann von Hollweg or
Germany and from von Jagow, the
German foreign minister, suggestions
which may save the situation.
It is thought that Colonel House. In
his dispatches to the President last
night, "urgod that no precipitate action
be taken until ho has had opportunity
to confer with the Chief Executive.
The German embassy is momentarily
expecting the arrival or the new in
structions. As soon as they reach hero
Ambassador von Bernstorff will ar-'
range for a conference with Secretary
Lansing.

Department insists, tho United 8tdlea
is still standing tlrmly, were set forth
In the formal notes of May 13 ana

BERLIN (via Amsterdam), Feb. 4.
Unless America waives the demand for
disavowal of the sinking of the Lusi
tania, or agrees to submit the -question
to arbitration at Tho Hague, an amica
ble adjustment of the German-American
controversy Is Impossible. This Is
the unanimous vlw taken by German
officials and Berlin newspapers today.
