Laclede Bakery
Laclede is now eating home
made bread, that is, bread made in
Laclede. Mr. Jamison opened his
new bakery Monday and put his
first batch on sale that day. It
will be known as the Laclede
Bakery. The product was good
but the baker informs us it will be
better when he gets the new oven
regulated and everything in more
perfect working order. There will
be no bread shipped in now. all
places in town where bread is sold
are handling the Laclede baked.
In addition to supplying home con
sumption the Laclede bakery will
ship to other towns, baskets having
been shipped south Tuesday after
noon. In taking hold of the pro
ducts of the Laclede bakery the
local merchants are certainly show
ing the right spirit towards the
new industry and practicing what
they preach about patronizing home
first. We predict a good business
for the Laclede bakery.

A Candidate For Treasurer
Marceline Journal-Mirror.
Mrs. Flo Carr, principal of the
Park school building, in this city,
has yielded to the solicitation of
her friends it is understood, and
will be a candidate for the republi
can nomination for county treas
urer. The present , treasurer is
Mrs. Ruth Hayes, a very worthy
lady, whose nomination upon the
democratic ticket is conceded. The
republicans who it seems will be
more than usually aggressive in
county politics this year have
selected Mrs. Carr as a worthy
opponent for the ingumbent, and
one likely to poll the full republi
can vote. Mrs. Carr has a wide
acquaintance throughout the coun-
ty, and is well qualified for the
position. The

Thieves are getting hard pressed
for booty when they break a lock
to secure what little brass there is
connected with stock scales. But
that is what they did recently and
took the brass beam and slides
from the stock yard scales owned
by J. W. Power & Son. As junk
the brass they secured would pro
bably bring about a dollar yet if
caught and punished they could be
sent to the penitentiaiy. There is
a reward for information that will
lead to the arrest and conviction of
the thief.
The most despisable scoundrel
we know of is the fellow who
sneaks . around after night and
places a lighted match under
thermometers found displayed in
front of the business houses.
Several valuable instruments have
been blown up and ruined by this
method which is a malicious des
truction of property and there is
no punishment too severe for the
dirty mongrel if he could be caught.
The only regret is they do not dis
figure the scamp when they explode
so he can be found ont.
