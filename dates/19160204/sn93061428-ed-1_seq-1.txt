Mr. Leopold represents the United
fiUteo Forest Service and also the
- Albuquerque Game Protection Asmo
elation of which he Is Secretary. He
haa been closely Identified with the
movement for better game protection
which has of lata made (Treat strides
in New Mexico, and Is (riving this lec
ture in Alamogordo In order to place
before our citizens the aims and ob-
. Jacte of the irame protection move
fJ menu and to explain the necessity for
immediate and decisiva action to save
the game supply of the state. Mr.Leo
pold lectured last week at Silver City
under the auspices of the Southwes
tern New Mexico's Sportsmen's Asso
ciation, and proceeds from there with
Supervisor Balthls to the Guadalupe
mountains to lay out plana for pro
tecting the remnant of mountain sheep
found there. He will then iro to Roe
well and Carlsbad to (rive lectures
nd- confer with Pecos valley sporta
men. This lectura ought to be of interest
not only to sportsmen, but also to lo
ALMOST
cal stockmen and business men, Inas
much as Mr. Leopold will discuss in
detail tha proposed National Game
Ua, Refuge in tha Guadalupe mountains,
"T tha principal object of which will be
to save the remnant of mountain aheep
Mr. Leopold holda the opinion that
these sheep, if they can be saved from
extinction, can be developed Into one
of tha moat valuable resources of this
part of tft átate. Tkay ara tha sola
remnant of a bow almost extinct
pedes, ha Dtatea, and if they have a
chanca te increase ta tha point where
man making trip to their range
would have a god chanca of seeing
them, people would coma from all over
tha country just for a look at them.
Mountain aheep are acknowledged to
be tha Anee, of all gama animals, and
tha mountain sheep of tha Guadalupes
ra no exception to this rula,
a- Mr. Leopold states that tha Game
f Protectiv Associations now organised
at Taos, Santa Fa, Albuquerque, Mag-
dalena and Silver City ara Intensely
i interested in the Guadalupe sheep, and
ra going to insist that tha law pro
tecting them be absolutely and rigidly
enforced. In this they are naturally
desirious of tha full cooperation of
their fellow clUtens in tha Alamogordo
region. It ia pointed out that these
associations have already made one
' vary effective move toward tha pro
Mection of thee sheep In .persuading
i Mia Federal government to send trap
' per to the Guadalupe country to ex
' terminate the mountain lions, which
heretofore have been very destructiva
there, not only to the Mountain sheep
but also to local livestock.
Supervisor Balthia and Mr. Leopold
pent yesterday in Cloudcroft giving
public lecture there laat night. K
la reported that there was a large
audience and that considerable inter
est was aroused.
Local Forest Oflloers have submitted
reports showing that a total -of b,
deer and 61 turkey were killed by
hunters in the Alamo National Forest
uring the open season of 11)16. Mr.
aopold expiessea the opinion that
these figures, even though very appro
ximately coirect, indicate an alarming
scarcity of game. An ace of almoat
million aerea like the Alamo Forest
ught to yield twenty times that num
ber of killabla anímala each year, he
aays, and the fact that it does not,
how that tha breeding stock must
bo restored before the full value f.f
ur local fame resources can be de
veloped. He point aut that T.000
people vtaitCloudaroft and other polct
in tha Forest each year, and that
really adequate game supply would
bring larga proportion of these peo
ple back each fall on hunting trips.
Really rood hunting would bring pro
bably $25,000 into the region each
year, he says. And the only way to
net really good hunting Is for the
people to Join actively and aggressive
ly in vigorous campaign to enforce
the game law, exterminate predatory
animals, and educate the entire public
to a realisation of what game is real
ly worth.
MOTIIKK WOKRNKK DEAD.
Mrs. Magdalena Woemer died Wed
neiiday at 2:45 in tha afternoon after
an illness o fthree or four weeks.
Mrs. Magdalena Woerner (Nee Ell
wangeri was horn In Kloin llepparh,
Wurtcmburg, Germany, May IB, Di:i2,
and united with the Lutheran church
at the age of twelve. She came to
America with her mother and three
brothers and two sisters in 1848 and
located at Louisville, Kentucky, where
the Louinville water works is now
situated. She was united in marriage
!to Joseph B. Woerner in 1862 who
died in ia and naa nve sons, mom
as, Edward, Daniel, John. Wm. G.
Three of the sons are still living,
namely, Edward, John and Wm. I.
She lived continuously in the same
community until 1899 whea she came
to Carlsbad, N. M. During tha Civil
war Buell's army camped around her
home on two different occasions and
stole and destroyed everything so
.completely that any one that had a
few potatoes to eat considered them
selves fortunate indeed. Grandma
Woemer, aa sha was better known
in Carlsbad, occasionally referred to I
the Insults and indignities heaped up
on her and all those who were so un-1
fortunate a to live on the Mason and !
Dixon line during the Civil war. She..'
with many other women, were taken .
prisoners and kept In camp with her
Ave small boys without the slightest,
cause and waa subjected to the most:
-m oss insults. The men In the com-i
nunity were run away. Those re
f UHlng to go were as rula taken pri- j
soners or shot without the slightest I
provocation. Tha United States gov- j
. ernment gave her a war claim that
; amounted to many thousands of dol
lars, but the claim, like hundreds or,
thousands of other claims, waa never
paid. She often spoke of what a I
dainty cup of coffee made of parched
corn waa occasionally on Sunday
morning made by those who were so
fortúnala to (have enough com to
make a cud of coffee. Since war was '
declared In Europe she often aaid If
the ruler In Europe had her war
experience war would have been the
farthereat thing from their minds and
often said It was her prayer that the
present war would coma to an and
speedily as she knew what It was to
be stripped of all earthly possessions
and worst of all tho indescribable suf
fering of the old men, women and
children.
During her life life in Kentucky she
I made It her life work to minister to
the unfortunate. There were some so
poor none by the way side but what
she reached out a hel"'nr ha"d. One
eaae that might He refer ed tn was a
negro living near her home during the
Civil war who had smallpox and no
one was left to minister to him. She
nursed him alone until he died. When
warned of the danger to her and her
children, she said some one had to
look after hi wants.
Two brother survive her, living in
Louisville, Kentucky. 8he also har
four grand children living In Califor
nia and one in St. Louis.
During tha past ten years sha was
unable to attend church, being al
most blind and deaf, so on Sunday
morning about tima for church ser
vice she would watch people on their
way to worship wth tearful eye and
often expressed the wish that it was
possible for her to attend worship as
was her custom in former year.
She took aick with U grippe on Dec
20, of last year, and wa confined to
her bed until her death. 8 he rallied
several times and had great hope of
recovering, but on January 26 a bad
case of plural pneumonia developed
and aha sank rapidly, dying vary
peacefully February 2 at 1:45 p. m.
Funeral services were conducted at

San Diego. Calif , Jan. 81. Tele
graph and highway communication
into San Diego, was re-opened some-
what today: the city began buying
water from the C.ayamara reservoir
and relief work waa expedited by the
establishment of a naval radio sta
tion at Otay City, at the mouth of
the Otay river. The estimated num.-
er of dead remained at sixty-five for
he Otay and San Luis Rey valleys
vith about thirty-five bodies recov
icd. of which eight have been iden
tified. The Morena and Sweetwater dam
1 1 i 1 1 held, but the nutlet through
which the Morena reservoir fed Into
the Snn Diego water supply is chok
ed. The dairy ranch at santee own
ed by Walter Duppee of Chicago, is
believed to lie undamaged.
Relief parties of sailors and ma
rines, who have gone Into the valleys
took three days' provisions.

today. J
"The scene presented was one of
absolute desolation," said Mr. Block, '
"In one spot I saw piano, tilted at
an angle and about half buried in !
mud and sand. Nearby was a clump
of uprooted lemon and orange trees 1
still bearing blossoms and fruit. A
cow belonging to no one knows whom ,
and doubtless miles away from It
former home, stood graxlng a short
way off. In the middle of the in
undated highway to TI Juana, Low-!
er California, stood half of a house,
and several hundred yards further
down the road, was the other half
with a broken section of a bridge
leaning against it. Wagon beds, live-'
stock, sections of houses and other
objects dotted the expanse of water
and sand. Houses which remained
standing appeared about ready to
collapse. . I

"Both men are married, and have
families. They declined to apply for

mittee working in the dstrict had
voluntarily made provision for them. !
"One desolated family was that of
a farmer whose sight has been gradu

HAVE BEEN DROWNED.
San Diego, Calif., Jan. 2. At
leant fifty persons were believed
to have been killed late Thursday
when the lower dam of the San
Diego water sylem in the Otay
valley south of here, broke un
der the heavy pressure of the
flood waters. A wall of water
thirty feet high was released.
Sweeping down tha valley the
great flood of water carried peo
ple, livestock, and valuable farm
property to destruction. Score ot
residents were missing tonight.
Housa on twenty-five ranche
were a wept away. TV
Rescuers were unable to reach '.
the scene of the disaster tonight
aa all bridges were washed out
and swollen streams were so
treacherous it was impossible to
launch boats.
Several bodies have been seen
floating in the flood waters, ac
cording to reports received here.
The death list, it was feared
here tonight may reach fifty, but
the meagre details which have
been obtained thus far hams it
impossible to estimate accurately
the probable loss of life. Ijite
reports said twenty-live Jap
anese, men, women and child
ren, were drowned.
Tho breaking of the dam re
leased eleven billion gallons of
water, which ruxhed down
through tha thickly populated
and narrow Otay valley.
The property loss will amount
to at least $1.000,000. Because of
the fact that they were isolated
by the breaking of the dam,
which shut off any means of
reaching other communities,
hundreds of families in the vi
cinity were facing a food fam
ine tonight.
All possible efforts were being
hade here to send relief to the
sufferers in the valley. An area
fifteen miles wide and two mile
long is devantated.
