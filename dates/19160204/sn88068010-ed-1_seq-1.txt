James Wiley Stewart, born
April 8th 1839: died Jan. 27th
1916.
The curtain has fallen shutting
out the life of one of Chariton
county's most respected and lov
able characters that of . James
W. Stewart, whose demise came
most unexpectedly while asleep
at the family home in Mendon,
shortly after retiring Thursday
evening Jan. 27th 1916. Mr.
Stewart had been ailing for about
two weeks with "Grippe" but
had never been confined to his
bed and death was due to a weak
. heart
Funeral services were held
Sat Jan. 29th. at 1.30 p. m. at
the M. E. church in Mendon, o
which deceased was a member,
conducted by Rev. William D
Cater, assisted by Rev. W. C.
Whitehouse pastor of the Christ
' ian Church. Interment at Old
Mendon Cemetery.
A James Wiley Stewart was born
in Wayne county Kentucky, the
, son of John and Avis Johnson
Stewart of Old Virginia stock,
whose hardy Scotch ancestors
settled upon the shores of the
Chesapeake and braved the wild
erness of the new world. In
1843 the family of John Stewart
came to Mo. from Kentucky by
boat landing at Brunswick, in
which community deceased has
lievd almost continuously, becom
ing an . integral factor in . its
growth and development

On Nov. 26th 1913, Mr. and
Mrs. Stewart celebrated their
golden wedding anniversary and
the above named relatives and a
host of old friends were present
How feeble our efforts are.
Jiow futile are words, to pay a
just tnbute to the character of
tuch a man as Mr. Stewart and
to estimate such a life.
The light of the splendor of
his personality makes dim and
dark the printed page. Such a
rich, free and abundant life can
not be described by another; it
can be better felt and only partly
realized. - ;
In his veins flowed true blood.
Witn the growth of the years
( that brought him to manhood,
came courage, gentleness, hon
esty and generosity,
' Indeed -these were but the
natural fruits of the virtues in
stilled into his earl life by his
sturdy parents and bred into his
being by generations of a noble

through. He lived to see the
day when he could look back
upon the steep and rugged road
of struggling progress and be
happy in the consciousness that
he was living in a new and bet
ter day in which he had been a
helpful factor in bringing about,
the day of better ideals, for
which he consistently stood.
- The ideal life he still strove for
until he fell asleep in the arms
of his Heavenly father who had
been such a source of strength
to him through all his days.
Few men enjoyed a wider circle
of acquaintance than he and his
friends were legion. He feared
God, was law abiding and home
loving. He tried to follow the advice
of St Paul, "if it be possible, as
much as lieth in you, live peace
ably with all men." Well may
we close this tribute with the
word3 of the peer of poets, ' 'His
life was gentle and the elements
so mixed in him that Nature
might stand up and say to all the
world, "This is a man."

PRESIDENT'S PREPAREDNESS POPULAR
No Recommendations as to How We Shall Prepare,
But Whatever Necessary to Back Up Defense
of Principles and Lives Urged.
THRONGS GREET HIM EVERYWHERE
Only Room for Half the Kansas City Crowd When
15000 Are Packed jn Convention Hall.
From the start to near the finish of his trip for
the purpose of meeting the people of the middle
west and telling them of liis views on the question
of preparedness, President Wilson has been the re
cipient of the most unbounded interest in which
. Mrs. Wilson came in for f considerable share.
All along the President has contended that
"No nation ought to wish either an army or navy
to be proud of, to make a display with, to make a
toy of. It is the arm of force which must lie back
of every sovereignty ia the world." And further,
that he is very sorry thai auy one in this country
should go about crying ojut for war, yet he is as op
posed to peace at any prfce as any who pretend to a
semblance of courage or independence.
At Kansas City whqre the largest crowd which
has met him, President Wilson said he would go
back to Washington andsmile at any one who told
him the United States was not wide awake.
He said "We are ' witnessing a cataclysm and
God only knows what ; the issues will be." And
further he told them, "Modern wars are not won by
mere enthusiasm. They are not won by mere na
tional spirit. They are von by scientific conduct of
war the scientific application of an irrestible force."
But Just what he miknt'when he told his vast
audience at Kansas City "I assure you that there is
not a day to be lost, not, understand me, because of
any new or specially critical matter, but because I
cannot tell twenty four ; hours at a time whether
there is going to be troubb or not."
At Des Moines he told his audience that "God
helping me, I will keep this country out of war if
such a thing is. possible with honor." Thousands
stood in the cold on the outside of the hall and got
what benefit of the speech they could from the vo
ciferous cheering. When the President had con
cluded his speech he asked that the big orchestra
play America and that all join in the song as the
music was played. The great audience rose to its
feet and such a scene was never witnessed in Madi
sou square as that when the throat of every individ
ual in the hall shouted its loudest the words which
never fail to inspire. The President and Mrs. Wil
son joined the song for a time, then slowly took their
way up the incline which leads to the exit, and as
the song was finished, the President bowed and
smiled as he went out and Mrs, Wilson, her whole
being filled with the inspiration of the grand ova
tion, kissed her hand to the audience and disap.
peared.
