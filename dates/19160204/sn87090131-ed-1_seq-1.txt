GETTING ASTART
By
I NATHAMNEL YC. FOWLU, Jr.
(Copyragh. a15, by the McClure Newspaper bydicM .)
PUBLIC 8ERVICE.
The President of the United States,
and every other officeholder and gov
ernment employee of every class, from
the head of a great department to the
driver of an ash team, are members of
the public service, and most of them
depend upon their salary or wages for
a livelihood.
In this article, however. 1 am not
considering government officials, and
those who hold political offices. My
remarks refer solely to the govern
ment employees or clerks, and other
subordinates who occupy govern
mental positions similar to those in
mercantile houses.
Governmental positions are usually
obtained by appointment, but most of
the applicants are obliged to pass the
civil service examination, which is not
difficult, and does not require more
than a common school education.
Under the civil service one is not
likely to be discharged except for
cause, and is subject to automatic pro
motion.
The government employee, as a rule,
receives a larger salary or wage at
the start than does one doing similar
work for a mercantile concern. His
position is not affected by the times,
and he is reasonably sure of retaining
it, provided he gives fair satisfaction.
Should I advise one to enter the
government employ in preference to
taking a regular business position'
My answer must be both "yes" and
"no."
The government certainly offers a
more permanent position, and for the
amount of work done and the responsi
bility, gives a larger salary than one
is likely to be paid by the business
house.
The man of ordinary ability, who
is economical and who is satisfied
with a sufficient sum to support him
in moderate comfort, is probably bet
ter off holding a government position
than he would be taking his chances
in the business world at large.
The minimum governmental wage is
large, the maximum small, compared
with the salaries paid by business
houses.
The governmental worker has little
or no opportunity for receiving more
than a few thousand a year at the
very outside. The top of his depart
ment is not of commanding impor
tance, while the opportunities offered
by business are practically unlimited;
but many men in business are not bet
ter off financially than is the faithful C
and competent governmental em
ployee.
Great success is accompanied by
equally great risk.
If you are satisfied with a reason
able income, and a permanent post
tion. and if you are willing to continue
in it indefinitely without more than
moderate promotion, the government
is your best employer. If, on the other
hand, you are ambitious, and do not t
desire to limit the measure of your t
success, you will be happier in busi- 0
ness. taking your chances with other s
men, to win or to lose, as your ability e
and conditions may determine for you d
Bear in mind that the best fruit
may be at the top of the tree, the
hardest to pick, and that, in attempt
ing to reach it, you may slip and fall
to the ground. The higher up you C
go, the more likelihood there is of dis
aster. There is safety in the middle
of the road, and monotony, too. Ambi
tion enters the bypath where it may
be lost, and where it may discover the
source of high accomplishment.
On one hand is reasonable certainty
and a living income, on the other, un- b
certainty with many prizes. n
His Pleasure Spiked. g
It was the first swim of the season,
and the boys were plunging and
splashing gleefully in the water. One t
youth only remained on shore, wist
fully watching his companions disport
themselves.
Tears and knackles were in his p
eyes, and an Interested stranger ap
proached and asked the cause of the
sorrow so plainly visible. i
"I--boo--want to go in!" sobbed the
boy. E
"Then why don't you go?" inquired p
the stranger. t
"'Cos I'm afraid." came the reply. m
"Td get a hiding when I reached home, th
you see." gl
"But," pointed out his new-found ti
triend, "aren't all those other boys flu
risking a hiding, too?" of
The little boy burst into a fresh a
paroxysm of sobbing. o
"Yes," he replied; "but-my father's m
a professional cricketer, and wears
spikes in his shoes!" lo
Things Will Take a Turn. si
Mrs. Blox-Poor Mrs. Rounder! Her de
husband didn't leave her much when th
he died, I understand. il1
Mrs. Knox-No; but he more than 1l1
made up for it when alive. Then he
left her nearly every evening.
Ag Bad as That? a
Yeast-And does he see hisl doctor
onften? e
Crimsonbeak-Well, he sat next to
him at a stag dinner last night, but
hae couldn't mse him.
THE EASY WAY.
s, Progression's road is never straight.
v- It winds and counter-winds along the
m shores of the sea of life, crosses moun
oe tainous obstacles, goes down deep into
of the valleys of despair, and also enters
m the easy-going plains of the least re
)r sistance.
Since the day of creation men have
ft hunted for the easy way, the short
id cut, the smooth, straight highway, that
[y they might travel the shortest path
n- leading to accomplishment. Some of
ir them have arrived at their destina
n- tion, aided by what we call luck, for
n the want of a better name for it; but
men, as they run, win 'ecause they
Y have the strength and the ambition to
I overcome obstacles, to leap over hand
Le icaps, to reach their Y , irrespective
)t of the barriers of the rtiad
I have followed the careers of
many men of mark, those who occupy
't places of honor and of responsibility,
r and not one of them has reached his
destination over the easy way.
That which comes to you unsought.
B' unstriven for, gives you neither pleas
ure nor satisfaction, for you have not
' earned it, you have done nothing to
get it.
An earned dollar is worth more to
you than 100 dropped into yohr beg
ging hand.
e When you get that which you strug
Sgle to obtain, it is yours, all yours,
and you have a right to be proud of
it, partly because it was not given
t " you, and partly because you won on
a hard battlefield 'gainst a strong and
e valiant enemy.
Fo-,et that there is an easy way,
Â° partly because you are unfortunate if
you find it, largely because it is sel
dom to be f' imd.
Thousands of men struggle harder
hunting for the easy way than do
those who armor themselves for the
world's battle, get out into the open
field, and are willing to fight for fame.
If you would amount to anything, it
you would be satisfied when you reach
your goal, determine to earn what you
receive, to obtain it by hard and per
rF te-t strurtle.
Place Lu dependence upon luck. If
" ou meet it on the road, do not re
fuse to recognize it; but make it
'ollr 'Ave. -' yoe- Waster.
If you work, you iay accomplish:
if you don't, you will remain in the
ranks, unless unreliable chance takes
you by the hand and makes a pauper
of you.
So seldom does the easy way ap
pear that we may consistently claim
that there is no easy way; but, even
if there were, I should advise you,
young man and young woman, to re
fuse to travel upon it, though it ap
peared to lead to accomplishment.
Success is not measured by what it
is, but what was done to get it.
That which is thrust upon you,
which accidentally arrives, even
though it may be excessive wealth
or fame, is not founded upon that
stable foundation which is likely to
endure in business or in any other
department of the world's work.
All that is worth having is worth
working for.
There is no easy way.
CELEBRATED FOR ITS LACE
Venice Has Been Known for Many
Years as a Center of That Par
ticular Industry.
The lace of Venice has been cele
brated for many centuries. It was
made originally by nuns within the
walls of convents for ecclesiastical
garments. Then, with the fall of the
Yenetian republic, the convents were
closed and the lace industry ceased
to exist for an entire century.
In 1870 the Princess Margherita, af
terward queen of Italy, took measures
to revive it, especially as a means of
providing employment for Venetian
women. At present there are several
schools, subsidized by the government.
in which the art is taught.
The pupils are women of all ages.
Each sits on a low stool and holds a
plump. square cushion in her lap. On
this cushion is pinned a strip of paper
marked with the pattern, into which
the nimble-fingered worker sticks
glass-beaded pins. about which she
twists her threads. From twenty to
fifty shuttles depend from all sides
of the cushion, and these are thrown
across and back with the rapidity
of a typist handling the keys of her
machine.
The process looks so simple that it
looks like play, but the lace produced
represents thousands of dollars The
simple laces grow rapidly under the
dexterous fingers of the women, but
the exquisite rose point and other saim
ilar sorts are evolved much more
slowly.
Not Particular.,
"I understand you have applied for
a chair at the university."
"Yes, 1 sent in my application last
week."
"What one did you ask for?"
"I didn't specity. Jut mid somee
easy chair."
