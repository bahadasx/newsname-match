KOOCHICHING COUNTY DRY
BY VOTE LAST SUMMER
Home Rue Charter Does Not Give
City Right Redwood County
is Dry.
St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 4.The su
preme court in a decision filed this
morning held that International Falls
has no right to issue liquor licenses
under the home rule charter that
governs that city. Koochiching coun
ty was voted dry last summer under
the county option law and that law
was upheld by the court.
Claim Exclusive Right.
The action was begun by Interna
tional Falls liquor dealers who de
sired to have the law tested. The
council attempted to grant licenses
and an injunction against the coun
cil was issued by Attorney General
Smith. The International Falls in
terests claimed that the charter of
that city gave the city exclusive right
to grant licenses.
Appealed to High Court.
The injunction proceedings came
before Judge W. S. McClenahan at
Brainerd and he decided that the
city had no right and the injunction
was made permanent. The matter
was then appealed to the supreme
court.
Judge M. A. Spooner of Bemidji
and Attorney Banks of Grand Forks
represented the International Falls
interests.
The supreme court also decided
that although six dry votes were
found ilegal, Redwood county is dry
by four votes.

LUSITANIA CASE

Great Pessimism at Washington
Governments Must Reach Under-

Washington, Feb. 4.The greatest
pessimism since the beginning of the
war is evident here today as a re
sult of the latest communication re
ceived from Germany in regard to
the Lusitania situation. It is un
derstood that Secretary Lansing has
received a report from Ambassador
Gerard. Tne report has been for
warded to President Wilson.
Result of Investigation.
The report, it is stated, covers
what Gerard learned in Berlin. It
is believed that President Wilson will
not yield to the Lusitania demands
made by" Germany. The United
States government, according to one
high official, is unable to dicker any
longer with the situation and must
reach an understanding this month
America Must Yield.
Berlin, Feb. 4.Unless America
waives the demands of Germany
the disavowal of the Lusitania, an
amicable adjustment to the German
American controversy is impossible,
officials and newspapers say today.

Germany has done its utmost to prove
friendship for America.

TWO PARLIAMENT MEMBERS
DEAD MANY ARE MISSING
Ottawa, Feb. 4.Six people are
known to be dead as a resuJt of a
fire which destroyed the historical
?5,000,000 Canadian parliament
building last night. The fire, it was
declared unofficially, was caused by
the explosion of a gas bomb or an
infernal machine.
Frederick E. Pardee, chief Liberal
whip, and Wm. S. Loggie, a member
of parliament from New Brunswick,
are missing and it is expected lost
their lives.
Heard Explosion.
It has been established thet the
fir^t burst of flames in the reading
loom of the house of commons was
preceded by at least one explosion,
and probably by two. The force of
the concussion was so severe that
persons standing some distance away
were hurled to the floor. A rigid
investigation already has been under
taken by the dominion authorities.
The flames spread with such
amazing rapidity that the Ottawa
fire department was utterly helpless
to cope with them. Aid was sent
from Montreal on a special train, but
at 1 o'clock this morning the fire
the fire is still raging.
The loss cannot be estimated in
money. The buidling was valued at
about $5,000,000, but the contents
are of inestimable value. There was
no insurance.
The parliamentary library to the
rear was partially saved. Soldiers
were assigned to carry out its con
tents.
Escapes Were Narrow.
Members of parliament, spectators
in the gallery of the lower house,
government employes and others who
were in the building, narrowly es
caped death or injury. Within a few
minutes after the fire began corridors
were filled with smoke and at many
points walls of flame barred progress.
Colonel Geo. Bradburg, a member
of Manitoba Medric Martin, mayor
of Montreal, and a member from that
city, and Constable Helmer, a guard,
were at the entrance to the reading
room when the fire started. All three
asserted that it began with an explo
sion which filled the reading room
with flames and burst open the swing
ing doors. The force of the explo
sion was so great that all three men
were thrown flat on the floor. In
their opinion an explosive bomb or
an infernal machine was responsible
for the Are.
Many Doors Closed.
There were many doors to the great
building, but since the outbreak of
the war, all except the same portals
have been closed to safeguard the
legislation. The precaution made
escape more difficult and probably
was responsible for the deaths of
Mme. Bray of Montreal, and Mme.
Morrin of Bruce, in the rooms of the
speaker's suite. Mme. Svigny saved
her children by throwing them in
a fireman's net and leaping to safety.
Another guest saved herself in the
same way.
Among those severly burned was
Minister of Agriculture Burrell, who
fell unconscious after plunging
through a curtain of flame and grop
ing his way along a smoke-filled cor
ridor.
One of the first men to make his
way out of the chamber was Colonel
John Currine, who commanded the
Fourth regiment of the Canadian
first division through the battle of
St. Julien, where he was overcome
with asphyxiating gas.
Colonel Currine at once organized
into a fire brigade members of the
house, telegraph operators and police
attendants, who manned several lines
of emergency hose. They played
streams on the flames, but without
apparent effect, and soon were driven
back by the terrific heat.
Sir Robert Borden, the Canadian
premier, who was in the building, es
caped safely but Martin Burrell, min
ister of agriculture, was burned se
verely about tho head, and Dr. Mich
ael Clark, member for, Red Deer, was
burned about the hands.
Vienna, Feb. 4.(Official)Aus-
trian aeroplanes have made several
air raids on the Albanian ports of
Durazzo and Valona, in the greatest
aerial activity since the war was
launched.
