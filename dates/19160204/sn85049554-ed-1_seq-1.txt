some of the other men who had come
to the surface after the disappearance
of the vessel, but soon their cries

Washington, Feb. 4.—Secretary tun*
sring indicated today that the United
States decided to hold the Prussian
American treaty governs -the case of
the Appam, as Germany contends, and 1
all that remained to be decided was
the interpretation of the application of
the treaty'* terms.
The secretary disclosed further that
tihe sole question to ibe decided by the
interpretation was how long the
Appam should be permitted to remain
in American waters. The treaty
guarantees to a German prise the right
to come and go freely. If forced to
depart German officials have stated
that the Appam would be sunk.
Gei-mSny Is expected to contend the
treaty guarantees the Appam the rlgbt
to remain safe in Hampton Roads un
til the case goes before a prize court.
Technically the vessel does not become
Germany's prize until suoh a court
establishes thedr right of capture.
