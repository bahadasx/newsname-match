WOULD COME ON THE PUBLIC
v
NEW
YORK, Feb. 3. The an-
ractte coal operators rejected here
today the demands of their miners
lor a 30 per cent increase in wages,
complete recognition or the United
Mine Workers of America, a two
year working agreement, an eight
hour day and changes in the meth
ods of fixing wages.
The operators propose that if the
differences cannot be settled by the
interested parties themselves they
b submitted to the board of concilia
tion provided for in the award of
the Anthracite Coal Strike commis
n'on of 1902. The miners' demands
were formulated last September at
Wilkesbarre, Pa., and were ratified
last week by the United Mine Work
ers' convention at Indianapolis.
In reply to their employes. signed by
the heads of nineteen anthracite com
psnies and approved fct their meeting to
day. If Is stated that to grant the wane
Increase would, mean an advance to the
consumer of Co cents a ton for domestic
slues of anthracite. The operator de
clare that the anthracite Industry Is be
conducted "on n low a margin of
rofit as Is possible, if the operators are
to continue to serve the public.
The demand for recognition of the
United Mine Workers Is declared unrea
(enable, as it would "subject the anthra
cite region to the politics of an orgasrfta-
tlon absolutely controlled from the out
Hide. The operators point out that a
majority, of the members of the United
Mine Workers are employed In the bitu
minous coal fields. They hold - "the
rights of organised labor are fully pro
tected by the open shop principle estab
lished by tbe commission."

and Hsnry II. Spellman, charged with th
murder of Dr. C. Franklin tohr. was
conuluded at the forenoon session of the
superior eourt here today. It is ezpeoted
that the. case will reach the Jury some
time tomorrow. -
Th greater part of the session was oo-
cupled by the prosecution in, seeking to
irefute parts' of the testimony offered dur
ing the last week by the defense. A wit
ness called in twhalf of the two negroes
had testified that one of the bullets which
struck tr. Mohr catered his chest.' The
state today put on . a physician who
stated that both bullets entered the back.
Tbe state also sought to rebut the theory
that the assault on Dr. Mohr was for the
urpose of robbery.
Arguments, for. the defense were then
begun,' William H. I-ewls spesr&ing first in

FOR GOVERNORSHIP
Brother of Commoner Aocepta Filing

W. J. BRYAN IS BACKING HIM
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
LINCOLN. Feb. 3. (Special.)
That Mayor Charles Bryan is . the
political Moses to lead the demo
cratic party out of the wilderness Is
now settled. To make it. doubly as
sured he makes the announcement
himself. He recognizes that owing
to the conditions in all political par
ties someone must come forward and
save the whole country, and the
mantle of leadership has settled
upon him. ,
In answer to the. question of
whether he would accept. the filing
made this morning placing him In
nomination for the democratic nom
ination for governor, the mayor said:
Telia Why He'll Ban.
"In view of the very important ques
tions to be ' considered this year by the
voters of Nebraska and owing to the un
usual conditions existing in all political
parties, I feel It my duty to stand as a
candidate for- the -democratic nomination
for governor in response to, the petition
filed by tbe democrats of my. homo city
and the requests which have been coming
from throughout the state. I will there
fore file my acceptance and make the
beat fight for the race that . I know how.
I will give out a statement within a few
days relative to some questions that I
believe the voters of Nebraska wilt be
Interested in considering at the pri
maries." -Dnaht
of It Now.
When the mayor issued his celebrated
pronounclamento a couple of months ago.
which threw consternation Into the ranks
of his party, to the effect that every can
didate for a state and legislative office
must attach himself firmly to the water
wagon or be flattened out by the Bryan
roller, many of the mayor's friends
sought' consolation in the alleged state
ment that his statement was made with

The best Information obtainable is that

HASTINGS, Neb., Feb. 3. (Spe
cial.) Clarence J. Miles, for several
terms mayor of the city of Hastings,
now a prosperous grain dealer, and
one of the bet known of young re
publican leaders In the state, today
announced his Intention of going be
fore the voters at the coming pri
mary, asking for the nomination for
the office of governor.
Mr. Miles, in his statement of his
Intentions, says:
"In announcing my csndldacy for the
republican nomination for governor, sub
ject to the will of the voters at the pri
maries April 13, lflld. I might preface my
remarks hy sayinc that I have two mo
tives in my amhition to be governor. I
want to see the government of this great
youn-; state administered In an econom
ical, progressive and business-like man
ner, the same aa one would conduct any
large private enterprise. 1 believe that
men who work for the state should be
honest and capable, and that honesty
and efficiency for this particular work
are as necessary tests tor employment
by the stale as by the Individual. I be
lieve 1 understand business methods and
that I can and would apply three meth
ods to the atate administration. The
other motive I have is personal pride. I
feel that it In a legitimate ambition to
want to be governor of Nebraska, with
tbe hopes of successfully manaalng the
affairs of the state, so that most of the
people at the end of the term can say,
Well done.' That commendation and the
satisfaction from It are worth more than
the largest salary paid by the richest
business concern.
Position on Important durations.
"As the platform convention will not be
held for months after the primaries, It
seems only fair that candidates should,
In advance, lot the people know Just
where they stand on Important questions.
"While tha liquor question is not a po
litical issue, I have never tried to carry
water on both shoulders, and that there
can be no mistake In my position, I will
state that I am for high license and tem
perance but not for prohibition. I favor
high license as the best means of con
trolling the liquor traffic, but If tho peo
ple of the state, by their votes, declare
for prohibition, I shall abide the will of
the majority, and shall,. If elected gov
ernor, use all the power at my command
under the law, to oarry out the expressed
will of . the people. On tha other hand,
should the result be against prohibition,
I would enforce the Slocum law and not
favor, any material change In Its provis
ions, as I consider It the best state liquor

sity at its present high standard of ex

great educational Institutions. ' I also
favor tha sectional normal schools, and
realise their advantages. Oood roads
should bo encouraged generally, as a bet
tar moan ot transportation for our farm
era, and the advertising It brings through
tourists traversing our state.
Protection for Amerlesat.
' "I believe In a protective tariff protec
tion for American life, American Indus
tries and Amerlcati products. Tho tariff
should be modified to meet changed con
ditions, but shouid always be sufficient to
offset the difference between the price of
labor abroad and In this country. This
can be best arrived at through tha ap
pointment of, a non-partisan commission,
picked from among business men and sci
entific experts, and not politicians.
. "I believe In reasonable . preparedness
against war. In which the National Guard
should have a substantial part.
"I believe In absolute neutrality with
regard to the nations at war; that we
should be in a position to protect our na
tional honor, our freedom, our repub
lican institutions and our cltlsens,
wherever they may be, and a protest
against watchful timidity."

Mrs. France 1 Campbell.
PENALTY' PENITENTIARY TERM
Relly M. Smith, 69 years old, was
convicted of second degree murder
as the result of the shooting of Mrs.
Frances Campbell October 31 last,
by the Jury which heard the evidence
In his trial In District Judge Sears'
court.
The Jury deliberated a little more
than two hours,, taking the case

The verdict was a surprise to most
of tbe persons Interested In the case,
according to statements made last
night. The prosecution made no
demand of the jury aa to the degree
of homicide of which Smith should
be found guilty.
Consequently It was anticipated that in
the event the Jury found Smith guilty it
would fix the crime at manslaughter,
which Is the least of ths three degrees of
homicide. ,
Penalty Twenty Tears to Life,
The penalty for murder In the second
degree Is Imprisonment In - the peniten
tiary for from twenty years to life, to
be fixed by the court.
Although Mrs. Binlth, the gray-haired
wife of the defendant, remained in the
court room more than an hour after the
Jury retired waiting for a verdict, she
had left before the Jury cams. In. None
was present except the defendant, Ills
attorney, A. 8. Ritchie, Judge Bears and
