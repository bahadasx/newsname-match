To Erect New Building
For Power Clothing Co.
Purchased Lot Adjoining First National Bank
on the North—Will Erect Modern
Two-Story Building
A deal was consummated by0
J. R. Waters the first of the
w)eek whereby Ham Power, of
the Power Clothing Company
purchased the N 1-2 of lot 15,
block 1
Beach
adjoins the First National
bank on tihe north and in
purchasing it Mr. Power se
cured a half imtenest in the
party wall om 'tihe south. Con
sideration for the lot was
$3500.
In interviewing Mr. Power
a Chronicle representative
learned that his intentions aire
to erect a modern, two-story
fire-proof structure as soon as
weather conditions will permit
building operations to begin.
The building will
Jbe
brick and will be 100 feet
long 25 feet wide. The
first floor will house the Pow
er's Ckl-hiling tjirJporium and
the second flocir will be given
over to the tailoring depart
ment aind suites of office
rooms.
After the completion of this
structure the. Power's will have
one of the nicest and most
modrnly equipped buildings of
its kind in the state, as well as
-one of the best and most com
plete stocks of clothing and
furnishings. As Tom says:
"We are here ito stay. We
have faith in the city and tihe
country 'tributary and I am
^oing to substantiate this
statement by erecting a build
ing tlhat will be a credit to our
city. When we get into the
new building we wli'll have a
fixtures second to none in this
part of the state. We have paid
rent too Icing."
The spirit theft prompts Mr.
Power to make this move is
the spirit that should permease
every business main in Beach.
'Good, substantial, fire-proof
buildings are a credit to cur
city am! as an investment we
believe they 'will prove profit
able to amy concern expecting
to remain in business here for
a long term of years.
While the Power's Clothing
store will occupy the
marn
floor the building will not be
owned by the corporation but
by Tom Power as am indi
vidual.
Farmers' Next
Step Suggested
President McVey Spoke at Tri
State Grain Growers' Con
vention in Fargo
"The next step in the Ag
riculture Problem" was the sub
ject of am address by President
McVey of the University of
North Dako ta at the meeting of
the Tri-State Gnaiim Growers'
Association in Fargo January
20 and 21. President McVey
said 'that in his judgment the
next slfcep in the development
of agriculture consists of four
different things: First, the re
quirement for standardization
of farm, products second tihe
development of co-operation in
original towtnsite of I the handling of the marketing
This plat of ground problem third the formation
of a national! organization for
built of
propaganda purposes and
fourth, the bringing of an ad-!
equate credit system.
The speaker made the point
that the work which was to be
done for the farmers could not
Ibe done by Government poli
tical parties cannot do it the
farmers must do it for them
selves. Tihe beginning of the
introduction of business meth
ods ilnsto the industry of agri
culture nqust comie thru the
medium of cooperation. The
mem im the manufacturing in
dustries learned this along
time ago, and the farfmers must
do the same. So in time there
willl came to be cooperative
groups organized for 'tihe pur
po3e of selling their products
on a business basis and con
ducting iit with a full know
ledge of what the markets are
•and wihat they may expect
from the sale of their products.
The things which were out
lined by Presiden tMcVey were
definite in character and all of
them, according to the speaker
must iin timfe be undertaken.
Congress might well pass a
standardization act and providr
far the appointment of inspect
tors, and when the National
Organization Society begins its
work, there will probably be a
revival of interest in cooperat
ive effort.
In closing his address. Pre
sident McVey said:
"The individual must do his
pairt, and the nation must de
velop a condition in which he
can work to the best advan
tage. With such a view as
this, we ought to face with
confidence the step that should
be taken in the near future for
the development of agricul
ture."
In this Week's issue of the
Ohironicle appears a half page
ad advertising the closing-out
sale being put on by Rosen
berg & Lewison. This is a
bonalflde closing out 'sale as

May Bring Suit
Against Belfield
Sell Apples.
S. A. Wright, of Opportun
ity, Wash., has notified the
City Auditor, A. S. Ward, that
unless the city refund him $20
which he paid last fall for a
peddler's license, he wiill bring
suit to recover the samie
through 'the courts.
Mr. Wright arrived in Bel
field some time in November
wish a car of apples, which he
advertised for sale on the
track.
Acting on the advise of the
Council Chief Bol-tz waited on
Mr .Wright and informed him
that if he wished to peddle
isipples iin cur cdby. he must
secure from the Auditor a
peddler's license. At first he
refused and left for home,
leaving the car of apples on
the side track here. In a few
days he returned and interest
ed Mr. Alex Mcnty, am influ
ential farmer w(est of town,
in hrjs scheme, amd once mere
proceeded to, sell his apples
taking out a license under pro
test.
Mr. Wright's objection to
nayr'ng feir a license iw^s from
the fact that he was selling the
product of his own orchard
and ci!'3 med a fairmier's exemp
tion. If liSiiis be so it's quite
orobpible Mr. Wright will find
his claiim worthless, by mak
ing a mistake in calling in the
assistance of Mr. Monty, who
is a strong Farmer's Union
man. Taking advantage of
this fact Mr. ^Vright used it
to procure patronage, intimat
ing tlbat the Urr-n had taken
over the sale of his apples on
a commission basis.
Willh the exceptiicin of paint
ing and a little work on the ap
pcaches. the Red Trail bridge
at Medoira is now completed.
The work still to be dome will
be finished he firsit thing when
weather permits of the work
being done.
