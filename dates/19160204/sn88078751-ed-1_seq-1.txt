The Americans
President Makes
In
Kansas City, Mo., Feb. 3. In two
speeches in. 'Topeka, the capital of
Kansas', where pacifism is supposed
to he almost paramount, President
Wilson made the strongest declara
tion he ever nas uttered of his inten
tion to use the army and navy of the
United Stales to preserve certain
rights of her citizens.
So Ions as he is entrusted with the
executive power, he said, he will
stand ready to uso our armed forces
to maintain theso rights of Ameri
cans: First to travel on the high
soaa on legitimate errands. Second,
to carry on unrestrained commerce
with the neutral nations and to sell
food and -clothing to peaceful popu
lations yhorover. the conditions of
war maf;t it possible to do so unie'r
tie ordinary rules of international
law; third, to maintain the Monroe
doctrine.
Wliile tlio significance of these dec
larations .sank into the minds of his
hearers, who realized that the first
applied directly to our controversy
with tiip Teutonic powers, and the
second to the British invasion of our
commen-ial rights, the president said:
"The final test of the validity, the
strength, the irresistible force of the
American Ideal has come."
There was every Indication that the
president's arguments had won a re
sponse from the audience, A sen
tence that everybody seemed to like
was wlifii he said: "If Kansas will
not fight, who will fight, that Is to say,
fight for principle, light for an ideal,
right frir cnaracter, fight for right?"
For the Topeka audiences the pres
ldent outlined in- detail the purposes
for whioh the proposed armed forces
of thB United States would be used.
"There Is nothing," he said, "you
would lie quicker to blame me for
than neglecting to safeguard the
rlghtBiof Americans, no matter where
they" might he in the world. There
are perrfrtly clearly marked rights
guarantef'd by international law
vhlch every American is entitled to
enjoy, and America Is not going to
abide the habitual or continued neg
lect of these rights."
Would Safeguard Rights.
The president was equally emphatic
In arsorting his'rcsolutlon to maintain
the rights of Americans to unrostraln
ed commerce with neutral nations.
"There is another thing that wo ought
to safeguard, and that Is our right to
cell what we produce In the neutral
markets of the world," ho said. ''We
have the right to send food to peace
ful populations wherever the condi
tions of war make it possible to do so
under the ordinary rules of Interna
tional law. Wo have the right to sup
ply them with our manufactured prod
ucts." The president denied that he favor

ed a standing army any larger than
it is necessary for the routine uses of
reace. "The Increase proposed for the
standing army will bring it up to a
rtrengfh adequate to the needs of
peace and no further," he said. Ho
declared that all the administration's
continental plan contemplated was a
sufficient number of civilians be train
ed In the uso of arms and camp life,
so In time of war they might be used
tr supplement the small standing
army, a plan which he declared to be
wholly consistent with the traditions
of Kansas and all America.
The address delivered by the presi
dent In Kansas City was featured
chiefly by tho disclosure that If the
administration's naval program is
adopted the American navy will rank
.first among tho navleaof the .world.
At the conclusion of his address here
the president asked his audience to
sing "America," He stood dramat

whether President Wilson or John
Doe will bo tho declared presidential
choice of Ohio delegates to the Dem

utes of Ohio provide each candidate

BRITISH ASK RETURN OF SHIP
Ambassadors Spring-Rice and Von

Secretary Lansing Neither Side
Contends Appam Is a Naval Auxil
iary Passengers and Noncombat
ants Ordered Released.
Washington, Feb. 3,-That the Brit
ish liner Appam, brought into Hamp
ton Road3 by a German prize crew,
I will be held by the United States to
be a German prize of war and not an
cuxlliary cruiser is the belief in offi
cial circles here. The neutrality
board, which advises tho state depart
ment on such questions, announced
that the ship was a prize, but the an
nouncement was recalled later, pre
sumably because the state depart
ment itself has not acted.
The real point to be decided is
whether the Appam shall remain in
possession of the prize crew under
the terms of the Prussian-American
treaty or shall be returned to her Brit
ish owners under The Hague conven
tion. Indications were given that tie
state department will hold that the
prize belongs to Germany
Count Von Bernstorff. the German
ambassador. In a formal note to Sec
retary Lansing, gave notice that the
Appam came into Hampton Roads un
der the treaty which guarantees her
to her captors. Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,
the British ambassador, asked that
the ship be returned to her British
owners as a prize recovered under
The Hague convention.
It was regarded as significant that.
neither the British nor tho German'
authorities contended that the Appam
was a naval auxiliary. Thus tho Unit
ed States is relieved of deciding a
Cuestion which officials feared would
tecomo one of the most troublesome
complexities of the war. As both gov
ernments concede she is a prize, noth
ing remains to be decided except her
disposition.
The state department requested the
customs authorities to land all pas
sengers and noncombatants. Their
case now goes to the immigration au
thorities. Foreign consuls will care
for their own nationalities who aro
Indigent. Those who can afford to do
so are free to go on to Europe. Those
who wish to remain In the United
States must comply with the usual
Immigration regulations. Any Ger
mans who elect to return to Germany
and can not find ways to do so proba-
j fcly will have to be cared for by the
government at some immigration sta
tion. LIVE STOCK AMD GRAIN

FREEDOM TO
FILIPINOS
If The House Agrees To Sen
ate Action
Senate Adopts Clarke Amend
ment to Philippine Bill.
VICE PRESIDENT BREAKS TIE
Amendment Gives Absolute Independ
ence to the Filipinos After Two
Years and Not Later Than Four.
Natives to Bs Freed Without Agree
ment Among Nations as to Recog
nizing Their Independence.
Washington, Feb. 3. The senato
went on record in favor of absolute
Independence for the Filipinos after
two years andnot later than four
years.
By a vote, 41 to 41, tho vice presi
dent casting the deciding vote on tho
tfflrmative side, the senato adopted,
the Clarke amendment to tho Philip
pine civic government bill, which thus
directs the giving of independence to
the people of the Philippines.
Efforts to head off the Clarke
amendment and adopt in its place z
provision giving the president wider
discretion were defeated. Under thn
rmendment adopted congress alone
can undo the decision to give the Fill
linos their political freedom and the
president In the absence of any such
legislation will be obliged to carry
out tho mandate of the Clarke acend-rcenL-
Furthennore, the action ot the sen
ate indicates that the Filipinos are to
bo freed without any agreement
among the nations as to recognizing
their neutrality and Independence.
The Clarke amendment as originally
drawn provided that the United
States should negotiate treaties of
this character with the powers of tho
world, and If none would enter into
cuch conventions then the United
States was authorized to guarantee
their sovereignty and independence
for five years. This clause was voted
out, leaving merely the bare declara
tion of Independence.
Coaling Station Retained.
The senate voted to retain a coal
ing station and naval base In the is
lands, so It is to be expected thaL
when the hill is finally perfected It
will reserve this as the only remnant
cf American authority in the archi
pelago. The vote to strike from the Clarke
J.mendment the authorization to the
rresident to negotiate international
agreements looking to the recognition
by the great powers of the indeoend
ence and neutrality of the islands was
carried, r.3 to 31.
On the final passage of the ClarK
amendment, 3G Democrats and the
vice president and five Itepublioanj
voted for t'.ie unconditional independ
ence of the Philippines. Twelve Dem
ocrats and 29 Republicans voted"
cgainst the Clarke amendment. The
Sutherland amendment, which rlim
inatfd all guaiantees by th8 United
States prevailed by a vote of 53 to 31.
In an effort to prevent the passage
cf the Clarke amendment Senator
Hitchcock, chairman of the Philippine
committee, ho had charge of the
till, submitted a compromise amend
ment, which he decinred include'"- all
the provisions President Wilson had
urged. The Hitchcock compromibo
was voted down. SS to 22. It proposed
that the independence should be bo
stowed on the Filipinos In from four
to six years If a republican form of
government was formed and apprfved"
by the people at an election. Many
believe that tho president will with
hold his approal If the Clarke amend
ment pastes the house in Its present
form,
