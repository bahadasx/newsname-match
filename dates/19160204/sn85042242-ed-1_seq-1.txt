FAIR
Citizens' Committee of Bismarck
Issues First Statement to the
People.
OBJECTIONS TO REMOVAL
ARE MANY AND OBVIOUS
Demand for Transfer Is Unfair
and Artificial and Is a Back­
ward Step.
Bismarck has begun its fight to
retain the state capital and well de
lined plans to combat New Rockford's
contention have been formulated.
The following: statement has just,
been issued by the Kisniarck Citi­
zen's committee:
"There are many obvious Qbjec
tions to capital removal. It is a back­
ward step: it gives the slate a bad
name, waged as it is by 'New Rock
l'ord upon the theory that the west
portion of the state is inferior to the
eastern half of the state.
"There is no necessity or demand
for the removal only such as has
been artificially stimulated by the un­
fair publicity circulated from New
'Rock lord.
"The state of North Dakota Is a
large real estate owner, from which
the educational institutions, all of
which but four are located in the
eastern tier of counties, draw consid­
erable of their income. Most of this
land is situated in the Missouri river
slope, in a district that would be vi­
tally affected by capital removal. It
is hard to estimate the damage to the
state in land values were the capital
removed, but. land experts contend
that it would reach the millions.
"The S'-ope country has been grow­
ing rapidly in wealth and population.
This would naturally be retarded and
state institutions would have their
Viet' 1oj,f}icy impaired to an extent,
that ny one now can estimate. "It is
sufficient, however, to call attention
to possible depreciation in value of
state lands if the voters of the state
endorse New Rockford's position that
the Slope country is an unfit place for
the seat, of state government.
"In view, then, of the vast interests
which the state owns in the western
portion of thp state, it is certainly not
good business judgment for North
Dakota to adopt a policy calculated to
injnre its own interests. The iNew
Rockford agitation has engendered
bitterness and sectionalism in North
Dakota. Family quarrels are neither
wise nor profitable, even when wag­
ed among the family of units that go
to make up this great and glorious
state.
"Largely through the energy and
money subscribed by Bismarck citi­
zens. the capital was moved here in
territorial days. Thousands of dol­
lars were publicly subscribed and
many acres of land donated to the
state for capital purposes. The con­
stitutional convention in 1SSD recog­
nized the moral obligation toward
Bismarck because of, its, efforts ill
1882 and 1#83 and there was never
a voice raised against fixing.the cap-,
ital here permanently b,yj ycoiistjtu
tional mandate.
'*New Rockford h'a$, no, pipfat,. right
or any other l?inA of a..right, to take
the capital from Bisuiarck or to force
Bismarck to spend her resources and
energies in another capital fight.
"Bismarck is nearer the geographi­
cal center of the state than New
Rockford. It possesses better hotel
and railroad facilities. It has been
more than 30 years in perfecting its
facilities to care for the business of
a state capital. No valid argument
can be advanced why the voters of
North Dakota should transfer their
seat of government from a city of
more than 7,000 persons to the small
county seat of Eddy county, where
accommodations are inadequate and
where it will take almost a genera­
tion, and probably several, to build
up a city of the size and commercial
importance of Bismarck.
"Central and western North Da­
kota do not begrudge eastern North
Dakota the University, the College of
Mines, the State Agricultural col­
lege, the State Scientific School, its
two Normals, its Insane Asylum, its
School for the Blind and its Institu­
tion for the 'Deaf and Feeble-minded
and its Soldiers' Home. With all but
four state institutions situated in the
eastern portion of the state, the west
believes that section has been treated
generously bv the voters of the state.
"This committee also sees a dan­
gerous preceden-t being established
by INew RotkfOrd. It means placing
wheels under every state institution
and creating a breach between the
east and west th/it. can never be
bridged.
"New Rockford has attempted to
enlist the prohibition forces on the
ground that Bismarck is not a clean
city morally and that the sale of li­
quor is carried on in defiance of law.
This statement is unsupported by
facts. The Citizens' committee chal­
lenges 'New Rockford to bring for­
ward her proof. An actual canvass
of the situation shows that Eismarck
is as clean as any city in the state
and there is practically little illegal

Committee
On Ftood
Washington, Feb. 3.—Late today
the house passed Speaker Clark's res­
olution for a new standing committee
to handle legislation relating to flood
control. Republican Leader Mann en­
dorsed the resolution.
The new committee is expected to
make a scientific investigation of the
whole subject of flood control, vital­
izing a movement that has been agi­
tated in congress for several years
for co-ordination of forces that have
to do with internal waterways, flood
and kindred subjects.
(Representative Meeker of Missouri
said during the debate, that creation
of the committee would be the great­
est improvement in internal matters
ever taken by the house.

evening in the Grand Pacific hotel,
given by the Thursday Musical club.
The banquet was served at 7 o'clock,
in the spacious dining room of the
hotel. The long table hold clusters
of pink blooms and covers were laid
for $6. Mrs. .J. A. Haney was toast
mistress and filled her role with
splendid success. The response of
welcome was given by Mrs. J. A.
Graham, who is president of the club.
She was followed by a toast by Mrs.
.E. H. L. Vesperpian, who spoke on

to their feet and remained standing
until he finished. Much merriment
was afforded by the reading of the
club's prophesy by Mrs. John Larson.
Splendid Program Features.
The 'banquet was featured by ones
Of the most interesting musical pro­
grams yet given by the club. The
Bismarck male quartet, composed of
W. L. iMiller, Henry Halvorson, ten­
ors A. J. Arnot and 'George Hum­
phreys, baritones, entertained by
singing five numbers. This quartet is
the finest in the capital city and their
singing was featured by a splendid in­
terpretation of their numbers. They
were forced to respond to several en­
cores. The other numbers included
a piano solo by Miss Ethel (McKen
zie, who distinguished herself by her
artistic playing. Miss McKenzie is
one of the most talented young pian­
ists in the city and is a most valued
member of the club. Mrs. Arthur
Bauer and Miss E'essie Homan, two
of Bismarck's best known musicians,
contributed a piano duet, which was
•one-of the interesting features of the
program. Both Mrs. Bauer and Miss
Homan are artistists of exceptional
talent. The vocal numbers were pre­
sented by W. L. 'Miller, Miss Clara
Tatley and Mrs. John A. Graham.
Each of these young artists gave
charming interpretations of their
numbers and were given an ovation.
A pleasing feature of Mrs. Graham's
solo was the violin obligato played by
Donald McDonald. Dancing followed
the program.

The entertainment committee was
composed of Mrs. Vesperman, Mrs.
A. J. Arnot and Mrs. J. P. French.

Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 3.—The Canadi­
an parliament building was threaten­
ed at 11 o'clock tonight by a fire
which broke out two hours earlier,
between the commons chamber and
the library.
The bodies of two women had been
removed from the gallery of the low­
er house at 10 o'clock, and it was
feared other lives might have been
lost, as two members of parliament
were missing. Several persons, who
had been over come by smoke, were
taken to hospitals. Several police­
men and firemen were buried by the
collapse of one end of the building
and firemen dug frantically to release
them.
Premier Escapes.
Sir Robert Borden, the Canadian
premier, who was in the building, es­
caped safely, but Martin 'Burrell, min­
ister of agriculture, was burned se­
verely about the head, and I)r. iMicty
ael was burned about the hands.
M'any of the legislators experienced
diffculty in fighting their way through
smoke-filled corridors. Several fief

The entire fighting equipment was
unable to cope with the flames, and
Mayor Martin of Montreal, a member
of parliament, at 10 o'clock ordered
the Montreal fire brigade to this city.

discussion relating to fisheries was
proceeding, when a messenger rushed
into the room, shouting, "Fire! Run
for your lives!"
The members were driven back by
smoke and flames when they sought
an exit through the two main doors

stricken, stampeded for the exit at

certain witnesses for the state of com­

to prison, William II. Lewis, counsel
for the defense in the trial of Mrs.
Elizabeth Mohr, and two negroes
charged with the murder of her hus­
band, made a dramatic appeal to the
jury in his closing argument today.
Mr. Lewis, as counsel for Cecil
Brown, one of the negro defendants,
asserted that the stale was relying
on circumstantial evidence and that
there was nothing so unreliable—that
it had sent many innocent persons to
jail. He condemned the police meth­
od of investigating the murder by get­
ting "so-called confessions" from pris­
oners.
The entire day tomorrow will be
occupied with the arguments by John

On Board President Wilson's Special Train, Indianapolis, Ind., Feb. 3.
—President Wilson was speeding back to Washington tonight, con
vinced that the people of the middle west are with him on the ifSue of
national defense and are prepared to insist that congress take speedy ac­
tion. He finished his speaking tour in St. Louis today and expressed
the conviction that his mission had succeeded beyond his greatest hop#.
He will arrive at 1:00 p. m. tomorrow in Washington.
FIVE^MIiNUTE STOP.
When the president's train reached Indianapolis at
five-minute stop, a large crowd greeted him at ttjfc station^ When cries
were made for a speech he appeared on the platform of his ear and said:
"Indiana is all right."
President Wilson's advisers believe he has explained clearly why Hp
considers immediate preparedness imperative'and hat won'many converts
to the movement and given an impetus to discussion of the eiuse.
Another Trip Planned.

The resolutions approving Presi­
dent Wilson's administration declare
that the "issue of preparedness has
been met with sanity, patriotism and
good judgment," and further com­
mends the chief executive on the pre­
servation of the rights of neutrals
without resorting to war. Banking
and currency, tariff and trade regula­
tion laws of the administration are
also endorsed.
Victory For Lynch.
The so-called Lynch faction, com­
posed of followers of National Com­
mitteeman Fred B. Lynch of St. Paul,
won an unqualified victory at |he
opening of the afternoon session of
the conference, when the iRamsey
county Lawler delegation of that fac­
tion's choice was seated and Lawler
made a choice to the St. Louis con­
vention.
The Ramsey county faction, so-call­
ed anti-Lynch, then marched from the
conventioh hall, singing, "Good-bye
Postmaster, we're going to leave you
now."
While the Lynch factions won out
in the convention there were numer­
ous indications tonight that opposi­
tion would be met in the primary, as
complete opposition cards will be fil­
ed in Ramsey and other counties, it
was said.
Endorse Preparedneess.
Division of opinion over the extent
to which the conference should en­
dorse the pr^iaredness policy of the
president did not result in any ma­
terial differences. The resolutions
finally adopted declared the adminis­
tration had met the issue of prepar­
edness "with sanity, patriotism, and
good judgment," and further com­
mended the chief executive on the
preservation of the rights of neutrals
without resorting to war. Banking
and currency, tariff and trade regula­
tion laws of the administration also
are endorsed.
OPERATORS REJECT
DEMANDS OF MINERS
New York, Feb. 3.—The anthracite
coal operators rejected here today the
demands of their miners for a 20 per­
cent increase in wages, complete rec­
ognition of the United Mine Workers
of America, a two-year working agree­
ment, an eight-hour day and changes
in the methods of fixing wages.
The operators proposed that, if the
differences cannot be settled by the
interested parties themselves, they be
submitted to the board of conciliation
provided for in the award of the An­
thracite Coal Strike commission of
1902. The miners demands were for­
mulated last September at Wilkes
barre, Fa., and were ratified last week
by the Mine Workers' convention at
Indianapolis.

The crowd roared its approval.
"The plans now before congress are
merely plans to save the lives of

The president ended his speech

'President Wilson received from
