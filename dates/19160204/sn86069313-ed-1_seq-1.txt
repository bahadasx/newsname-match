AMERICANS VIEW
CAPTURED LINER
GERMAN CREW SAILS INTO NEW
PORT NEWS WITH IIRIT-

With the German .natal CBslgn flat

charge-ofa German prize .crew, tho
British' SoHth African Iiaer Appar
sdven ud for lest, toe' .refuge, la,
Hampton Roads this aforalBg with
the story of seven-vesseUvdestreyed
by German sea raiders- off the Afri
can coast.
The Appam was captured off the
Canary Islands on. January 15 by a
", Westaerman raider four days after
sho had sailed for Dakar, British
West Africa, for Plymouth, Eng
land. ,
Whether the captor was a Ger
man U boat or a hitherto unreported
German ""auxiliary crulsor Is unde
termined. From what was learned by
some of the officials who boarded
the Appam It Is believed that some
steamer, armed as a German auxil
fary, possibly the cruiser Mowo, raid
ing shipping off tho African coast,
took the British liner and put the
prize crew aboard. This view Is
supported by the fact that a sub
marine could hardly have spared a
'lieutenant and such a large crew to
a prize.
Lieutenant Berge, of the German
.navy, placed on thp Appam when
ishe was captured, brought-, in the
;prlzo, eluding the cordon of British
cruisers across the Atlantic, and
:addlng to the historic chapter of Ger
man exploits at sea,, a chapter to
:rank with the adventures of tho Em
den, the Prlnz Eltol Frledrlchand
the Kronprlnz WUhelm.
There are 451 persons aboard the
ship, Including 188 survivors of sov
en ships aunk by the submarine
-which captured the Appam; twenty
German' civilians being transported
fro:u Africa to England tq bo placed
in detention camps; forty-six mem
bers of the Appam's crew; 155 orig
inal passengers on the Appam, and
the prize crew of twenty-two.
Many of the passengers on the Ap
pam are women and children. There
are .also several high British colonial
officials, who were returning to Eng
land from Africa. There are also four
-wounded sailors,- taken from one of
the sunken ships, which resisted cap
ture and was shelled.
ftb Resistance.
According to the, information
leaned from ihose who talked with.
Lieut. Berge, the Appam was captur
ed without any show of resistance, on
January 15, tho day that British
news reports said wireless communl
., cation with the vesel suddenly ceas
edT A prize crew " was placed on
tboard and. the same day the raider
which 'captured the Appam gavo
chaso to another British steamer,
bound for Australia with a cargo of
.meat. Tho meat ship gave battle,
-was captured and was sunk, after a
large portion of her cargo had been
.taken off.
Six moro Vessels then were de-'
atroyod In rapid succession. It was
Mated. The crows were taken on
OjoariMhe Appam, which ran due west
across tho Atlantic for Hampton
Itoads.
The names of the steamers sunk
by the raider which captured the Ap
pam are given as the Corbrldge,
Trader, Dormomby, Farrlngford,
Clan MacTavlah and Arthur.
When the Appam passed la the
"Virginia Canes early-today and took
,,son a pilot, she was asked by the Fort
"tJMoriroe wireless station who she was.
SThe 'reply was, It 'was stated, that
tshe was the. 'German cruiser "Buf
falo:" i(jWhen she arrive at Old "Point,
oSaf latlaa oaeer MeCaffery went

The fear weaaded satiets were the
, sly ease f sUfcmsss feaod.,
. The, Oersaa CeaaaJ. b Marshall
von Schilling, took charge of the sit
uation and Lieutenant Berge placed;
himself under the consul's orders.
They went to tho office of Colonei
Ira Haynes, commandant of Fort
Monroe, where the German offlQef
paid his respects and explained why
he had .given the Ireles station the
namo of tho German cruiser ''Buf
falo." Lieutenant Berge and Consul von
Schilling sent mesages. to the Ger
man embassy at Washington and lat
er had conversations over the tele
phone with the embassy and with
'Customs Collector Hamilton. -
No One Allowed Near.i
Pending the receipt of Instructions
fromo Collector Hamilton,' no one is
allowed on or near the Appam.
Guards are at the rail on -every, side
and no gang plank, is down. Ef forts
to communicate with any of'the pas
sengers' from small' boats encircling
the, steamer are forbidden.
The -JV.ppam has one three-lach
gan meMHted efe'her bow, but wheth
er it waaon. board before, her eap
ture or waa mounted by the Ger
mans is not known. She was
brought in under the German man-of-war
flag, Instead, of the'German
merchant flag, and her name -was
given to the quarantine officer as
"S. M. S.. Appam," meaning the
German warship Appam:
When seen on his' way to visit Col
onel' Haynes, Lieutenant Berge re
fused o talk. Asked for information
he merely shook his head and, re
plied: "Nothing to say, nothing, to
say. He is a smaii man ui augm

.TOBACCO COMING IN.
Mr. J. B. Westerfleld, of Fords
vllle, has closed a deal with the di
rectors of the Hartford Warehouse
company wher,cby gets the use of the
local warehouse, for the comlng'year,
and will buy tobacco here the rest
of the season. Already tobacco is
coming in and at press hour last
night between 50,000 and 75,00'0
pounds of the weed has been bought
for delivery here. The warehouse
ts being cleaned out and prepared
and by next week buying here will!
bo in full sway.
Mr. Westerfleld Is acting aa agent
for a Louisville corporation that al
so has representatives, on the loose
leaf floors in Owensboro .and prac
tlcally the same prices' will be paid'
here that prevail in that city, except
the higher grade tobacco, which' we
understand ,1s not' desired, at the reg
ular scale of prices. ' Since the meet

that farmers living near Hartford
, must haul to deliver In Owensboro,
I however, Is so great that they will
no dou.bt take advantage of tlo op

I Thp buying of tobacco here will no
doubt, stimulate business In this sec-
'tlon, and the handling of the weed
will give employment to several

asserted Mr.. Logan. "You have.jaii

One bf the discouraging, features
of the situation to his mind is.that
any attempt) to correct conditions is
met only with the strongest; opposi
tion. Unnecessary expense accounts
and department salary and expense
rolls of Illegal size are the chief fea
tures so far encountered. t-
It cost 61,000 last year to r.uiMhe
office of the department of. education.
That included, only the office exaaa
ses. This susa, was greater than the
cost of tho conduct of the auditor,
attorney general's 'and 'the Govern

' "The dopartmtent made a request
tor seven stenographers;" said .Mr.
m
Logan, "L don't know" how manjrjljto,. whether or not these cases will
they need. Bu'f ItMr. V. 0.,Gilbert

has Just as much legal authority to
appoint 700, with no' limitations on
their salary. When I "declined to
countenance such a procedure, I be
gan to be assailed In letters from alt
over the State, wanting to know
whether I was opposed to the common
school system.
Let Him .Appeal to Assembly.
"If the superintendent needs seven
stenographers let him go to the Leg

What One Trip Cost.
"One trip ot an officer- to Michigan
cost (he State over $200. He didn't
get the prisoner, and the law express?
ly forbids payment of expenses unless
the prisoner is, bagged. His next trip,
in which he got his man, cost the
.State $250. These sums -are out
