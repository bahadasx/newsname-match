Washington, Feb. 4. President
WIlBon was attacked as a "Jingo" by
Senator Works of California today.
Speaking before the sonato mili
tary committee, Works said Wilson's
campaign for military preparedness
la an "unwise attempt to scare the
people Into accepting a program they
do not want."
"Tho public mind," ho continued,
"has beon excited iby publicists and
movies, and now the president Is In
creasing that excitement. Among
his statements Is one that we should
have the biggest navy In the world.
But I can not believe that he realizes
what Great Britain's naval program
Is, or that It has the policy of laying
down one battleship for each fight
ing unit laid down by an other two
nations combined.
"For my part, I see no cause for
alarm, and I do not. contemplate that
this nation .will be led Into war."
Works epoke In behalf of the bill
for defense "against the forces of na
ture';; In this connection he advo
cated further reforestation and re
clamation to prevent floods and other
natural disasters "llkoly to cause a
greater loss of life and property than
war would." '
London, Fob. A, Prussian lossos
in dead, wounded and missing men

Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 4. The giant
Gothic parliament buildings here
stand today a gaunt, smoking ruin,
while six persons are known to have
lost their lives, as the result of a Are
that sweirt through tho structure dur
ing the night.
Shortly before 3 a. m. the Are had
been controlled, though flames still
flickered through the senate side.
The great library appeared likely to

Dead Mesdamos Bray and forla,
guests of the wife of Speaker Sevlgny,

two other men burled when a section
of wall collapsed.

Incendiarism Susitected
The origin of the conflagration 1b
a mystery, though officials who un
dertook an Investigation suspected ln-
cendarlsm, possibly German. How
ever, aa policemen guarded both
doors of tho commons reading room,
where the fire began, and other po
Ucemen were Inside. It would have
hom verv difficult for any one to
start the Are undetected. At the
samo time, there were stories of ex
plosions at the outset, giving perhaps
tangible support to bomb theories.
The fire, which caused damage es
timated at from $4,000,000 to $5,-
000,000, began In the reading room
about 9 o'clock last night. The
flames were shooting In spirals
through the Gothic towers and
spreading sparks some distance be
yond. The red light against the sky
could ibe seen for miles.
Groat blankets of Are rolled rapid
ly through the structure. At mid
night the tower chimes boomed out
above the roar of the Aames, but an
hour and a half later the tower
crumbled with a crash audible for
blocks. Long before this both the
senate and commons chambers had
been wiped out.
Aid Sent From Montreal
Volunteer Are brigades and the full
city department vere unable to make
an impression upon the Are, so aid
waa hurried from Montreal by special
train.
Colonel John Currle, who distin
guished himself in the battle of St.
Jullen. proved himself a hero when,
rushing from the flaming building he
organized parliament menvbers, po
lice and telograph operators Into a
volunteer squad. Heedless of the
smoke and Are, the colonel dashed
Into the building at the head of this
force and led the work of fighting
the Are with emergency hose.
The Arst word of the Are came Just
before 9 o'clock as a handful of legls
lators were debating a flBhorlos mea

while gallery spectators, In a panic,

Mayor Martin of Montreal, two

It spread with terrible rapidity. This

Six Dead In N. Y. Fire

SAYS AID
MUST
Berlin, Feb. 4. Unless America
waives her demand for disavowal of
the Lusltania torpedoing, or agrees
to submit the case to The Hague for
arbitration, an amicable adjustment
thereof Is Impossible, Is the unanim
ous view today of officials and news
papers.
The Lokal Anzeiger, one of the
most influential newspapers here, de
clared that Germany has done her ut
most to prove her friendship for the
United States, and that she can not
admit that the sinking of the big
Britlfra liner, with her munitions
cargo, was a violation of international
law.
While semi-official advices here a
few days since said that instructions
had been forwarded to Ambassador
von Bernstorff at Washington which
gave reasonable assurance for a posi
tive understanding, the general feel
ing here has veered from that view
point since. The consensus of opin
ion Is that Germany has gone as far
as she can in trying to settle the situ
ation. '
Officials, however, hope that Col
onel House, President Wilson's en
voy, may be able to present the Ger
man attitude aa correctly as possible,
so that an amicable understanding
may be reached. -
Colonel House will take back to
President Wilson some mild criticism
of the administration on the grounds
that it makes its diplomatic moves
with too much noise, it is reported
here.. Officials have told House tnat
probably more might be accomplish
ed in dealing with the central em
pires If greater secrecy were used.
For instance, it was pointed out that
Austrian officials have been leary of
discussing some affairs with Ambas
sador PenAeld, inasmuch as press re
ports of instructions to him in the
past have been printed in Vienna be
fore these orders reached PenAeld.
RAID OVER ALBANIA
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Vienna, Feb. 4. Raids on Avlona
and Durazzo, Albania, were reported
in today's official statement, which
detailed the greatest Austrian aerial
activity since the war started.
"Five Austrian aeroplanes on Janu

Other raids on the Gallcian front
were detailed. '
In these Russian and Austrian air

"Russian Infantry raids northeast

The proposal before the city coun

also to include other amusement con
cessions at the park for that period
of time, has aroused a storm of pro

Macduff, Geo. Lundberg and Dr.
Macy addressed the council. These
gentlemen '"proposed to- the- council
that If the management of the toath
house seemed a "white elephant" up
on the city's hands, that they turn It
back to the citizens, stating that If
this should be done the citizens would
Incorporate for the .management of
the bathhouse and other attractions
which might later be added to the
Park. ' -
The gentlemen proposed that all
profits from the bathhouse would be
returned to the improvement of the
park property if It was operated by
the citizens.
A. resolution that had been unan
imously adopted by the Parent-
Teacher association protesting
against the leasing of the bathhouse
to persons for private gain was read.
Two petitions, also numerously
signed, were read asking that the
lease be given Mr. Schmidt as pro
posed in the ordinance.
The committee of citizens present
stated that; by another meeting night
It could have the details of its pro
