THE WAR TODAY
The instructions regarding the
Lusitania negotiations with the
I'nited States, sent to Ambassador
von Bernstorff, do not provide for
un admission that the sinking of
the liner was illegal, according to
information from Berlin. It is de
clared the indications are that the
(.ermun government will in no cir
cumstances admit the illegality of
the sinking.
Notable success for its airmen
in raids on the Albanian port of
Dnrazzo is reported by the Aus
trian admiralty. Three attacks on
tills important allied base between
Jan. 25 and Feb. 1 are recorded.
The Italian base at Avlona, Al
bania, also was attacked by Aus
trian aviators on Feb. 2.
Vienna reports the bombardment
of Buczacz In Ualit-ia by a Russian
air squadron and Russian raids
further north, in Yolhynla, appear
to have been equally active.
A second Zeppelin mr raid on
SalonitI, attempted on Wednes
day, was frustrated by the fire of
the allied batteries, according to
an Athens dispatch.
Artillery fighting continues along
the western front, especially near
Loos, which the British hold, and
around Neuville, where the Ger
mans recently took some French
positions.
A German Zeppelin with her
crew of 20 has been lost in the
North sea and it is said, tliat the
air craft was brought down by the
fire of Dutch anti-aircraft guns.
The collier Franz Escher was
sunk in the North sea by a bomb
from a Zeppelin returning from a
raid on England. Thirteen of the
crew were drowned and three
saved.
On the Russian, the Austro-Ital-lana
and the Caucasus fronts little
fighting has taken place.
An Austrian submarine has cap
tured the stmer Koenig Albert
from the Italians in the Adriatic
sea.
The Canadian parliament build
ing at Ottawa, which cost more
than six million dollars, was prac
tically destroyed by fire last night
and six lives were lost. By some
the fire was attributed to a bomb
or Infernal machine. The fire
burned for six hours and was not
under control until 5 a.m.
A report from Fetrograd de
clares word has been received that
Erzerum, to which a large Turk
ish force was recently driven after
a defeat by the Russians, has been
evacuated by the Turks.
Erzerum has been considered
one of the main" Turkish strong,
holds on the Caucasus front. A re
lief force sent thence from Tre
bizand on the Black Sea coast was
recently reported In retreat after
a sndden fight against the Rus
slans. Today's statement from
Constantinople does not mention
the Caucasus operations except a
they are inelnded in the general
statement that no events of Im
portance have occurred.
6 WOMEN PERISH
IN HOUSE SWEPT
BY FIRE IN NIGHT
New York, Feb. 4. Six women per
ished In a fire which destroyed the
home of Mrs. Casimir Tag at 243 Han
cock street, Brooklyn, early today. Mrs.
Tag, widow of the president of the
German Savings bank, escaped, but
two of her daughters were among the
victims.
The dead are:
MISS CAROLINE TAG and MISS
HELEN TAG, the daughters of the
late bank president.
HANNA E. SNAVLEY, 68 years old,
a cousin of Mrs. Tag.
JENNIE SJTEBMAN, a nurse.
TWO SERVANTS.
The fire which began in a partition
on the lower floor of the four-story
house, is attributed to defective insu
lation ol wires.
Miss Caroline Tag awakened her
mother, who is 60 years old, and aided
her to escape through a third story
window. Apparently Miss Tag then
went to the rooms of her sister and the
other occupants to awaken them and
she with the others was trapped by
the flames and smoke which filled the
hall and stairways, cutting off their
means of exit. There were no fire
escapes in the building.
Miss Tag was engaged to be
married on Feb. 15. Her father was
prominent in the tobacco industry as
well as in banking and left an estate
estimated at $1,500,000.

yesterday of Francisco Villa on the
garrison at Moctezuma, 100 miles
south of here.
Beyond establishing the fact that
Villa himself led the attack, no news
had been received at military head
quarters early today to indicate how
the fight progressed.
Troops under General Herrera were
hurrying from Chihuahua City to At
tack Villa, while reinforcements from

END OF CASE
IN LUSITANIA
Germany Refuses to Brand
Actions of the Subma
rine as "Illegal."
BERLIN IS STIRRED
Germans See Gravest Crisis
of War at New Turn in
Negotiations.
Berlin, Feb. 4, (via London.) In
formation reaching the Associated
Press today indicates that under no
circumstances will Germany admit the
sinking of the Lusitania was an illegal
act.
The new instructions forwarded to
Ambassador Bernstorff, according to
this information, contains simply one
phrase of the new formulation of the
proposed note of regret for the sink
ing of the Lusitania. The suggested
sentence is short, consisting of only
eight words and does not contain the
word "illegal." It represents the ex
treme limit of Germany's concessions
in the Lusitania case.
Most Serious Crisis.
The view is entertained here that
one of the most serious crisis of the
war has arisen in connection with the
Lusitania case, and that it is impossi
ble to foresee the outcome from any
indication here. The result of the ne
gotiations appears to hinge solely on
the one word "illegal."
In the way of an agreement between
the United States and Germany stand
only these seven letters, expressing
th conceptfotrwhich President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing insist must be
embodied in the German formula ex
pressing regret for the loss of Ameri
can lives aboard the Cunarder.
Germany Refuses to Use Word.
The Associated Press is informed
positively and authoritatively that Ger
many cannot and will not designate as
illegal the sinking of a liner by any
submarine.
Virtually no other differences in the
way of settlement remain, and the
new instructions forwarded to Ambas
sador von Bernstorff on Tuesday con
tain merely the new formula by which
it is hoped to satisfy Washington with
out humiliating this country.
Although the suggested sentence, ac
cording to a reliable version, consists
of only eight words and does not con
tain the word "illegal" or characterize
the sinking of the Lusitania as such, it
goes otherwise to the furthest ex
tent possible toward meeting American
desires.
Hints at Break.
Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, under-sec-retary
for foreign affairs, in an inter
view with The Associated Press, ex
pressed the hope that the new for
mula forwarded to Ambassador von
Bernstorff would offer a possible bas
is of settlement. However, he made no
effort to conceal the gravity of the
situation and was most explicit in his
statements that Germany had reached
the extreme limit of concessions and
under no circumstances would con
cede the illegality of her submarine
campaign in the war area.
"The government is willing to do
everything in its power, and has done
everything in its power, to meet Amer
ican wishes," he said, "but there are
limits beyond which even friendship
! snaps.
"I do not understand America's

Appam to be
HeldGerman
PrizebyU.S.
Washington, Feb. 4. Secretary Lan
sing indicated today that the United
States had decided to hold that the
Prussian-American treaty governs the
case of the Appam, as Germany con
tends, and that all that remained to be
decided was the interpretation of the
application of the treaty's terms.
The secretary disclosed further that
the sole question to be decided by the
interpretation was how long the Ap
pam should be permitted to remain
in American waters.
The treaty guarantees to a German
prize the right to come and go freely.
If the Appam were forced to depart
she would doubtless become the prey
of British cruisers outside the Vir
ginia capes. If forced to depart, Ger
man officials have stated the ship
would be sunk to prevent her recap
ture by the British.
Germany is expected to contend that
the treaty guarantees the Appam the
right to remain safe in Hampton
Roads until the case goes before a
prize court for adjudication. Techni
cally the ship does not become Ger
many's prize until such a court estab
lishes the validity of her capture.
Newport News, Va., Feb. 4. Only
Lieutenant Berge and his small prize
crew remain today aboard the former
British passenger steamer Appam,
brought into these neutral waters last
Thursday as a prize of war. The lin
er's passengers and original ship's
company, taken prisoners when the
steamer was captured by a mysterious
German raider off the Canary Islands,
Jan. 15, were liberated last night by
order of the United States govern
ment. The passengers today are aboard
the Old Dominion liner Jefferson, en
route for New York, where they were
expected to arrive tonight. The mem
bers of the crew, with the gun point
ers taken from other British steam
ers which the raider sank before the
Appam was overhauled, are in Norfolk
awaiting the sailing of another New
York steamer tonight
The Appam is to remain at this
port until the Washington government
decides what disposition of her shall
be made whether she shall be held a
fair prize of her German captors
under the Prussian-American treaty
or returned to her British owners
under the Hague convention.
Washington, Feb. 4. Conferences
over the status of the British liner
Appam were continued today between
Secretary Lansing and other officials
of the state department and the neu
trality board.
Officials are proceeding cautiously
in determining the course of the Unit
ed States government because of the
many diplomatic complexities involv
ed in the case. '
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British
ambassador, today presented a formal
demand on behalf of his government,
for the return to British owners of the
liner Appam, taken by a German
prize crew. A new diplomatic con
troversy with Great Britain is fore
shadowed as the United States prac-
Itically has decided the prize is Ger
many's.
JUDGES AND LAWYERS
GATHER AT DECATUR
Decatur, 111., Feb. 4. Judges of the
supreme and appellate courts of Illi

of the Illinois Bar association of the

heated discussion on the matter of a
new constitution for the? organization
and on the advisability of changing
the method of instructing juries.
Hotel Destroyed by Fire.
Hull, Mass., Feb. 4. The Rockland
House, one of the largest hotels at
Nantasket Beach, was destroyed by
fire today. The loss is $100,000. The
only person in the building was the
caretaker, the hotel having been closed
since the end of the summer season.
BRITISH PREPARE
TO BULK GERMANS
London. Feb. 4. The Times an
nounces today that the government "is
taking various important steps" in con
sequence of Monday's air raid. The
first of these, the newspapers say, is a
change in the policy regarding the
publication of accounts of what hap
pens.
The other steps, the Times adds,
are obviously of a confidential charac
ter, hut there is no question that the
visitation has produced an outburst of
unusual activity in the department
concerned."
The responsibility for defense
against air attacks is still dual, ac
cording to the Times, the defense of
London being vested in the war office,
while the defense of the coast line and
the remainder of England is with the
admiralty. This, says the Times, is ob
viously an unsatisfactory arrange
ment and Is not likely to continue.

JITH HEAVY TOLL OF LIFE
FIVE LIVES LOST
IN HOTEL BLAZE
Atlantic City, N. J., Feb. 4. Five
persons lost their lives and eight oth
ers were seriously injured today in a
fire which destroyed the Overbrook
hotel here. Several of the injured are
expected to die.
The fire is believed to have started
in the kitchen. When it was discovered,
flames were shooting up the elevator
shaft and soon afterward the entire
building was burning. Many guests
had to jump from windows.
One woman was seen to faint after
calling for help from an upper win
dow and was burned to death while
her body lay across the sill in view of
hundreds of persons unable to help
her. The engineer of the hotel hung
out of a window until the fire reached
his hands and caused him to drop to
the street. He was killed almost in
stantly. Another woman who managed
to crawl out of a window fell and
also lost her life.

nesday night In a eoUlslon with
the steamship Linan and 160 lives
were lost.
Twenty-one persons were saved.
The Linan, badly damaged, Is re
turning to Hong Kong. The col
lision occurred at night, at a point
80 miles from Swatow.
The Daijin Maru, 243 feet long,
was built at Kobe In 1900. She was

The Linan Is owned by the China
Navigation company of London.
She is 300 feet long and was built

Athens, Feb. 2, (via London, Feb. 4,
5:05 p. m.) "There Is not any way to
tell you so that you would understand
the awful horror of things that I have
seen in the last month," said Marie
Lemos of Chicago, one of the Red Cross
nurses who survived the sinking of the
Italian steamship Brindisl which re
cently, struck a nilauia -the- Adriatic.
She continued:
"The hideous rapidity of the Blnking
of the steamship Brindisl with her
decks covered with dead; myself shot
into the water, which was full of strug
gling youths trying to keep afloat but
disappearing one by one within sight
of land; the Austrian aeroplane at
tacks on San Giovanni de Medua and
Durazzo; the sight of hundreds of
Serbs falling exhausted and dying from
hunger and cold along the road of
their retreat through Albania it does
not seem believable."
Miss Lemos is 22 years old, with
broad features, revealing her Bohe
mian extraction. High laced boots, a
khaki blouse, a jacket embroidered
with the Red Cross insignia and a
flannel waist constitute her only pos
sessions. "We struck a mine at 9:30 o'clock
in the morning and the ship began to
sink immediately," said Miss Lemos.
"We tried to lower a boat but the ship
keeled over so that everybody was
thrown into the water. Miss Hample
could not swim and never came up. I
scrambled back aboard the Brindisl
where I found some 200 Montenegrins
who were unable to swim. These men
said they would not die by the enemy's
hands. They sang their national an
them and then one squad shot the oth
ers and finally killed themselves. The
decks were covered with dead and
awash with blood.
"When the ship began to founder I
slipped back into the water and swam
to a plank on which several men were
clinging, but who dropped off one by
one. Finally, after being three hours
in the water I was picked up and taken
to San Giovanni de Medua.
"As soon as the 143 persons
rescued were safely ashore the
remaining Montenegrins lined up
and re-sang the national anthem.
While the men were singing ai
Austrian aeroplane squadron bombard
ed the town, killing 18 of those who
had Just been saved.
"From San Giovanni de Medua we
walked to Scutari and sought to Join
the Serbian staff at Plavnica but six
days later the occupation of the town
took place.
"King Nicholas of Montenegro fetch
ed us to Scutari in his boat He is a
kindly old man who seems to under
stand, but Prince Peter says he wants
to give up the struggle and again be
gin life as a private citizen, preferably
in America.
"From Scutari we walked five days
through sleet and snow over detestable
roads, along which the hunger-weakened
Serbs died like flies.
"Reaching Durazzo, seven pursuing
Austrian aeroplanes bombarded the
town where the remnants of the Serb
Ian army were so crowded that they
were unable to escape the missiles.
Many were killed and other wounded,
and owing to the lack of medical stores
the suffering was frightful."
