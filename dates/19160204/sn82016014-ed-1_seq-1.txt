Ottawa, Fell. 4. Canada's
magnificent parliament building
which cost more than $6,000,000
lay in ruins today swept by a
fire attributed by some to a
bomb or infernal machine. At
least 6 lives were lost and many
nersons were injured. The fire
was under control at 3 a. m. to
day after rasrins: furiously for
six hours. The known drad are:
MME. BRAY, wife of M. A
Bray, of Quebec, and daughter
of the late George Tanguay of
the legislative council.
MME. MORIN. wife of Louis
Morin of St. Joseph de Beauce,
Quebec.
ROBERT FANNING, a waiter
employed in the building.

uncle of Alph.
Another dominion policeman
is bHieved to have been kUIed

Contents Priceless.
It was stated last night that Fred
erick F. Pardee, the chief liberal whir
in the house of commons, also was
missing, but it was subsequently
learned that he went to Sarnia. Ont
yesterda v morning and he could not
have returned before the fire.
The financial loss is difficult to es
timate but the contents of the build
ing were of great value. At an early
hour today it was believed that the
parliamentary library in a far wing
had been saved. While the fire was
burning soldiers carried out many of
its 200.000 volumes.
The parliament bull dine was rated
as one of the finest Gothic structures
on this continent. It covered four
acres on Parliament Hill.
Several persons who were burned or
otherwise hurt in fleeing through the
corridors before the swift rush of tlu-
flames or in escaping from the win
dows, are in hospitals. One of those
most severely hurt is Martin Burr ell
minister of agriculture, who wa.
burned about the head. Dr. M ichae'
Clark, member for Red Deer, suffer
ed burns about the hands. Sir Robert
Borden, the Canadian premier escap
ed without injury.
Mother Saves Children.
Mme. Bray and Mme. Morin wer
guests of Mme. Sevigny, wife of the
speaker, and were trapped in tin
speaker's rooms.
Mme. Sevigny dropped her two
children into a fireman's safety net

another of her guests. Mme. Dussault
of Quebec. They escaped unhurt
"When the firemen reached the speak
er's chamber they found Mine. Bra
and Mme. Morin unconscious. Vain
attempts were made to revive them
with pulmotors.
The origin of the fire can be deter
mined only by an investigation which
it is understood, will begin as soon as
possible. The fire started in the read

The fire which began in a partition

BLOW UP LEVEES
Attempts on Goy't Stmctnre at
Pine Bluff, Ark.
Dynamiter Hoped to Rush
Flood Waters From City.
Little Rock, Ark., Feb. 4. An at
tempt made last night to dynamite
the government levee at Pine Bluff
and which failed would have di
verted the course of the Arkansas
river many miles from the site of the
town. A small dam was - blown out
last night near Grady to relieve tho
flood. Officials are investigating at
tempts on the Pine Bluff revetments.
With the water slowly rolling into
the lower reaches of the Arkansas,
the suffering in the flooded areas is
becoming intense. Hundreds of per
sons, driven from their homes by the
water, tiliniy clad and unused to the
extreme cold weather that has pre
vailed during the last wek, are paying
toll to water and weither. Relief
work can proceed only slowly as few
facilities exist to p-ovide succor and
the towns in the flood area virtually
are isolated.
Refugees at Iouula.
All buildings on the state's penal
farm at Cummins, a 7,000-acre tract,
has been swept away. The farm has
been damaged thousands of dollars,
commissioners say. Suffering from
the flood today concentrates at Doug
las, where, it was reported here, that
1,000 refugees have sought help.
An urgent call for boats, food and
feed was received in Little Rock today
from Dr. C. W. Dixon, of Douglas.
D. C. Welty. agricultural commissioner
of the Iron Mountain, is expected to
arrive in Little Rock today with a steel
boat to be taken at once to the lower
reaches of the Arkansas that it may

T. P. Van Orsdol was elected presi

ganization held last evening in the
rooms of the State Horticultural so
ciety. T. P. Van Orsdol succeeds
George W. Van Orsdol as president.
W. I. Cole was selected as vice presi

secretary-treasurer to succeed John

Reports up to date indicate that the
fruit prospects are in good shape at
present, with the possible exception of
peaches which may have been injured
during the freezing weather of Janu

degrees below, here in Topeka, the ice
which covered the buds and continues
to do so. excluding the air, smothered
the prospective bloom.
A program was arranged for the
next meeting to be held the first

from the Agricultural college at Man

Pruning," F. P. Rude will talk on
"Gardens in General," while M. T.

WAR TALK BANDIED BY PRESS
Will Not Admit Lusitania Sink

Kaiser's New Note to U. S. Con
cise and Final.
Washington, Feb. 4. (Bulle
tin) Late today Count Von Bern
storff, the German ambassador,
received his government's answer
in the Lusitania negotiations and
took it to a conference with Sec
tary Lansing. The ambassador
said before conferring with the
secretary he did not understand
how the instructions he had could
be unsatisfactory to the United
States.
Berlin, Feb. 4. The view is enter
tained that one of the most serious
crises of the war has arisen in con
nection with the Lusitania case, and
tl.at it is impossible to foresee the
outcome from any indications here.
The result of the negotiations appears
to hinge solely on the one word
"illegal."
In the way of an agreement be
tween the United States and Germany
stands only these seven letters, ex
pressing the conception which Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
insist must be embodied in the German
formula expressing regret for the lossfl
of American lives aboard the Cun-j
arder. i
The Associated Press is informed
positively and authoritatively that
Germany cannot and will not designate.
as illegal the sinking of a liner bv anv
submarine. Virtual jy no other diffU1
culties in the way of settlement remain
and the new .nstructions forwarded to
Ambassador Von Bernstorff Tuesday
contain merely the new formula by
which it is hoped to satisfy Washing
ton without humiliating this country
Although the suggested sentence,
according to a reliable version, con
sists of only eight words and does not
contain the word "illegal" or charac
terize the sinking of the Lusiti-nia as
such, it goes otherwise to the fur
thest extent possible toward meeting
American desires.
Await President's Decision.
Washington, Feb. 4. In the ab
sence of official information Secretary
Lansing today refused to discuss any
phase whatever of the Lusitania nego
tiations. It appeared at the state de
partment, however, that if officials
regarded the situation as seriously as
it is reflected in Berlin dispatches, it
was not permitted to appear on the
surface. Something definite may take
form soon as President Wilson re
turned to the capital this afternoon.
Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, under sec
retary for foreign affairs, in an in
terview with the Associated Press,

the illegality of her submarine cam
paign. IT. S. Demands Too Much.
"The government is willing to do
everything in its power, and has done
everything in its power to meet
American wishes." he said, "but there
are limits beyond which even friend
ship snaps.
"I do not understand America's
course. We had thought the sub
marine issue and the Lusitania ques
tion on the way to arrangement had
agreed to pay indemnity and all that
when the United States subsequently
made its new demand which it is im -
possible for us to accept.
"You must not push your demands
too far. You must not attempt
humiliate Germany." Dr. Zimmer
man left no doubt that the whole
crisis centered on Secretary Lansing's
demand that Germany disavow the
sinking of the Lusitania as an act ;
contrary to international law- The j
under secretary declared repeatedly j
that Germany could not admit this
procedure was illegal or make con- j
cessions which virtually would take
the submarine weapon out of her

that if the United States desired to

Berlin, Feb. 4. Unless America ad

question to The Hague arbitration, an

Ami'rian controversy is impossible.
