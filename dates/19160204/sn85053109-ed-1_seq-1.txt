Two Dollars Per Year
Half Million Grain
Larson's Estimate
100,000 Bushels, Exclusive
Feed and Seed Remain
Unmarketed
T. J. Larson, of the Boinboy
Larson elevator, estimates the
grain produced here this fair as
approximrtely half a million
bushels. He estimates the a
mount unsold to date, not in
cluding a reserve for seed and
feed, as 100,000 bushels. At the
present time very little grain is
being marketed here, due pri
marily to unfavorable weather
conditions. Undoubtedly, too
a number are holding their grain
with the expectation of realiz
ing still higher prices and as the
tendency has been upward for
more than a month, many are
of the opinion that wheat will
sell for $1.25 a bushel in local
market.
The big crop produced this
year was certainly a boon to
this community. In sections
farther east where the grain
crop was light, farmers are com
plaining of their ill fortune in
not being favored in a time
when such high prices prevail.
Little wonder that they experi
ence a feeling of envy when in»
formed of our unprecedented
yields—and little wonder that
so many are making inquiries
about the possibility of purchas
ing farms in this part of the
west.

People are still laughing over
the jokes at the Burns banquet.
The kilts and the lartan were
much in evidence. So were
"Bonnie Sweet Bessie," "Bong.^
Doon," Wert Thou In the C<*
Blast,"
"Flowers O' Edinburgh"
Holden Grey Breek
"Flow"
Gently Sweet Afton," "Oh, My
Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose,"
"To Mary in Heaven" and "The
Bonnie Lass O' Ballochmyle."
Dr. Gold's sermon last Sun
day morning was on "The mean
ing of existence." He showed
very clearly that the material
universe and our present life in
it would be utterly senseless
and without meaning were it
not for the idea of a future life.
All interest centers in the fu
ture—in tomorrow. It is the
future that gives value to the
present. Great thought, Doctor.
There have been quite a num
ber of interesting sleigh parties
around here of late. That at
Trombley's, west of town seems
to take the lead. The bells
are jingling, and some of the
hurry-up outfits would make a
mule laugh.
We heard about a poor fellow
who had both hands so frozen
that they will likely have to be
amputated.. Another had his
feet so frostbitten that they
may have to come off. They
are said to be laborers on the
railway. People should b e
warned to exercise care during
such extreme degrees of frost.
Tom Bird is said to have been
found in an unconscious state
North of Headlight recently.
His dog attracted the attention
of passers-by who went to his
aid. It is reported he will like
ly recover.
Mrs Bond entertained the
primary department of the Pres
byterian Sunday School to a
rousing time at her home in the
Frisbee building the other day.
It is a question whether the
coal famine will be averted yet.
Just imagine being without fuel
out on this bleak plain! O-o-o
Oueh.
Even the mountains look
chilly these days.
Several very excellent gen
tlemen have moved from the
northern camps in the Reclam

Mazes
éVenlÉg was a gala one
in Odd Fellow circles, when
twelve "good men and true"
were placed astride the faithful
"goat" and rode that fractious
animal through the mysterious
mazes of the initiatory degree.
A luncheon and social session
followed and it was a ghostly
hour before the closing ode was
sung. The following became
members:
S. J. Rigney, Dan Kelleher,

Dr. Nerall was called to a
home north of Ethridge a few
days ago; one of the coldest
days of winter. It was a twen
ty mile drive and the roads
were in bad shape and the doc
tor states that it was one of the
worst experiences in his profes
sional career and a continuous
exertion to keep from freezing.
Wm. Anderson drove over
from 'the Kevin Country Thurs
day, a distance of twenty miles,
to secure a load of coal from
a local dealer. Fortunately he
was able to return home with a
load. Ht- says there is no coal
in Kevin and that the situation
in that section is serious, with
no hope of relief.
The "goat" backed into a
string of coal cars Monday even
ing, with bad consequences to
both "Maud" and one of the
rear cars. The switch engine
was backing up and the collision
smashed the tender badly and
broke the end out of the car.
A switchman escaped possible
death by jumping from the
tender before the crash.
Miss Gladys Furey returned
to St. Paul today after a visit

Humble Vocation
of Editor
Washington, Jan., 29.—Speak
ing of his announcement of a
determination to withdraw
from congressional life at the
close of his present term. Con
gressman Stout said today:
"The people of Montana have
been mighty good to me and I
have attempted to repay them
for their generosity by devoting
earnestly my full time and
endeavor to the task of repre
senting them here at the na
tion's capitol. If I believed that
I was the only person available
who can adequately perform
the duties of the office I would
be entirely ready to set aside all
personal considerations and
stick with the job, but I ap
preciate that there are scores of
good men in Montana who can
represent the interests of our
state here in Washington with
just as much fidelity and doubt
less greater distinction than I.
Mv future plans contemplate
going back to Lewistown, re
suming my old job as the editor
of my newspaper and taking
only such part in public affairs
as every good citizen should
deem his duty to take in both
development and upbuilding of
a thriving and progressive com
munity."

Sad Circumstance
Monday afternoon the seis
mograph in the Pioneer Press
registered a "disturbance" in the
Ethridge section, akin to a small
earthquake. A few moments
afterward an S. O. S. call came
in from the Ethridge World of
fice. When the distress call
was answered it was found that
the editor and publisher of the
World was forced to abandon
his lofty journalistic estate and
resort to the turgid and menial
task of "bucking" a woodpile.
This low occupation was forced
upon the World man by the sad
circumstance of a coal famine
in Ethridge. Later in the day
the soothing and assuring news
came over the phone that a
Mexican had been subsidized to
dismember the woodpile while
the editor repaired to his editor
ial room to typewrite an editor
ial entitled "Northern Montana
as a Desirable Winter Resort
for Rich and Blase Easterners."
