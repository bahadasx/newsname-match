go oot and tell my fellow countrymen
that new circumstances havs arisen
which make it absolutely necessary
that this country prepare herself for

"Whenever the ordinary rules of

or Ignored," be continued, "thereto
danger of the more critical kind of
controversy.

not of our own making and not under
our control. I think no man in the
United 8tates knows what a single
week, a elngle day. single hour may
bring forth"
The President socks of the navy and
the coast defenses, saying:
"Take for example the matter of
our coast def ensea. It to obvious to
every man that they are of the most
vital importance to the country. Such
coast defenses as we bave are strong
and admirable, but we bave not got

Yoa have been told that it ia the sec

oning by It actual strength I believe
It to be one or the most esftctent naviee
In the world: but Its strenght ranks
fourth, not second. You must reckon
with the fact that It to necessary that
that should be our first arm of defence,
and you ought to insist that everything
should be done that It Is possible for
us to do to bring the navy up to an
adequate standard of strength and effi
ciency. - ' .
"Where we are lacking moreper
harw is on land and In the number of
men who are ready to fight. The
characteristic desire of America Is not
that ahe should have a great body of
men whose chief business to to fight,
but a great body of men who know
how to fight and are ready , to fight
