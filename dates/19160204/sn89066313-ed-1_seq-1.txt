ted by any undergraduate of the Uni
versity of Missouri. The money part
of the prize is therefore in abeyance,
at least for the present session.
The department issued tlie follow
ing statement:
"Tlie department feels that it would
be a real loss to the University to
have its best prize discontinued en
tirely a prize which has given the
University of Missouri a distinction
shared only by two other universities
in the world, Oxford and Harvard, and
which has now in its history an
honorable list of prize-winners. On
this account it has been decided to
continue the contest this year as
usual, and award the distinction of
a place in the list of Feild prize win
ners if a worthy competitor appears.
Although the financial part of the re
ward must be omitted, the honor will
remain as great as ever; and it is
sincerely hoped that those students
who are Interested in poetry will help
the University to carry on the tra
ditions of this great prize for the
present year.
"The subjects for this year's con
test are two: "The War and 'Shake
speare. The first is the topic which
stands foremost in the minds of us
all at this tragic time; the second Is
suggested by the approaching ter
centenary celebration of Shakespeare's
death. It should be emphasized that
in prescribing these two general sub
jects the English department does
not desire that candidates should try
to write upon either one of these sub
jects as a whole; such a course indeed
Is Inadvisable. The writer on any
general subject should first of all
narrow It down within definite and
manageable limits; and such aspects
of the subjects prescribed as, for
example, 'The Retreat from Mons,'
'The Death of Rupert Brooke,' 'The
Duty of America,' or 'Shakespeare's
Heroines,' 'At the Mermaid Tavern,'
The Growth of Shakespeare's Imagi

Missonrian Corrects Wrong Imprest
sion Given by an Article Ycsterdaj.
Prof. R. H. Baker of the department
of astronomy of the University does
not ask that a printed correction be
made, but nevertheless the Missourian
wishes to make amends to him for an
unintentional wrong done his depart
ment. The last paragraph of an article
printed yesteiday, dealing with the
partial eclipse of the sun, gives a
wrong impression. It might be in
ferred from this paragrapli that the
department is inclined to facetious-
ness in answering serious questions
that are asked of its members regard
ing scientific phenomena. The state
ments in this paragraph were wrongly
attributed to Professor Baker; they
were in fact made by another person.
The Missourian is glad to make the
correction.
The Laws Observatory is of court"'
glad to receive inquiries from any
one at any time and to answer them
courteously and to tho best or its
ability.
While driving his delivery car north
on Sotttli Ninth s'reet this noon, W.
W. ("Buck") Davis, the motorcylce

the vehicles locked. The motorcycle
skidded about fifteen feet and hit the
post.
Armstrong stopped immediately and
took Davis to the hospital. It is
said that the Injured man may be out
in a few days.
