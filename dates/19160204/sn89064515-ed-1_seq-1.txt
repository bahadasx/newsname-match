TOSGH GETS VERDICT FOB $90—
GAKIN CASE NOW OCCUPIES
ATTENTION OF OOUBT
Diatrict cburt is still in session and
there is no indication of the work be
ing completed within less than ten
clays as there are still two jury cases
to try, which will probably take until
fthe middle of next week to complete
and then there are enough court eases
to be disposed 01 to last at least a
week, according to County Attorney
Kosenmeier.
Today the case of the State of Min
nesota VS- Chas. Gakin is occupying
the' attention, of the court. D. M. Cam
eron, city attorney, ia prosecuting the
2ase, as the defendant is charged with
the violation of a city ordinance. The
case may be completed by noon.
Tomorrow the first case to be taken
up will be that of Theo. Pohlkamp vs
John Naber, both of Buckman town,
The plaintiff charges that he was de
ceived in a real estate deal, claiming
that certain land which he purchased
of Mr., Naber was guaranteed against
laying any quack grass, but upon .ex
amination was found to. be full of it.
The last jury case is that of Blaczek
vs. Kugler, an action for accounting
for labo?. performed.
Late -Wednesday afternoon the jury
returned a verdict for %the defendant
in -the case of Math. Jtitigwelski vs..
Andrew Leazynski. In this action the
plaintiff sought to have the boundary
line between his and Mr. Leazynski's
farm established along the route of a
certain ditch, claiming that this
boundary was the correct one by ad
verse possession. The correct bound
ary line was recently laid out by the
couity seiunreyor and the verdict of
the tjury therefore established the^ new
line, a* the correct one. The plaintiff
-also sued for damages to his 1915
•crop, for a fence which he alleged was
taken from his land by the defendant
•and for permanent damages to the
land because of the filling of the
ditch. The verdict of the jury on the
boundary line question settled all the
other questions.

fendant tike same day in the. caseof
Johnson' Bros. vs. L. Zigmaq. Tlie
plaintiffs sued for a grocery bill of
about $150.
After deliberating for sixteen hours,
the jury in the case of Frank Posch
vs. the Water Power company of this
-city, brought in a verdict for $90 for
the plaintiff. This case occupied more
time in court than any other this term,

his horse, which occurred one day last
fall when the horse as standing on
Market street, near the Victor store.
He was tied to the electric light pole
and was standing on wet ground and
the plaintiff charged that he was kill
ed by an electric shock, caused by a
grounded wire.
HORSE RACES ON ICE SUNDAY
Next Sunday afternoon, if the track
can be cleared of snow, and if the
weather is favorable, some interesting
horse races will be pulled off here.
"Twice the races have been postponed,
the first time on account of the ab
sence of one of the horse owners and
the second time on account of the deep
snow and intense cold. But those who
expect to enter the contest state that
they hope to be able to race Sunday
afternoon. Racing will probably be
gin at about 2:30.
Much interest has been manifested
in this sport of late and everyone is
anxious to see the races pulled off.
Burton & Greisch and Sam LaFond
have horses which it is believed will
"be closely matched, although the horse
owned by the former parties has never
been seen in a race here.
IPAY FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS
PROPOSED BT ALDERMAN VEN
NERS—MAYOR AND BOARD OF
PUBLIC WORKS INCLUDED
H. W. Venners, during his year's ex
perience as a member of the city coun
cil, has found out that this office is
one which should pay the holder a sal
ary sufficiently large at least to en
courage him to attend meetings. He
therefore expects to circulate a peti
tion in the near future, asking for a
vote, at the spring election, on the
proposition of amending the city char
ter to provide for a salary for the al
dermen, the city mayor and the board
of public works.
Mr. Venners will do this from an
entirely non-personal standpoint, as he
will not be a candidate for re-elec
tion as alderman, but he knows that
the duties of these offices are so great
as to make them worth a reasonable
salary.
Although no definite arrangements
"have yet been completed, according to
the plans of Mr. Venners the salary
of the aldermen should be $3 for all
regular meetings, and $1 for all special
meetings,, providing the members
would be present for roll call. The
mayor's salary should be at least $100
per year and the salary of the board
of publie works about 30 cents an
hour, he says.
Few people realize how much work
is connected with public offices, es
pecially of aldermen. They ^old at
least twelve regular meetings each
year, usually as many adjourned regu
lar meetings and a large number of
special meetings. They also must
serve on committees, which requires a
great deal of extra work. The office
of mayor also is one of a great deal
of work. Members of the board of
public works must investigate all, peti
tions for public improvements such as
sewer construction^^etc^ a a a.
IMIHH
BUILDING WILL BE OF BRICK
WITH STONE TRIMMINGS,
POSTMASTER IS ADVISED
Plans for the new government post
office to be erected here in the near
future, have been completed and ac
cepted. Postmaster Brick was advised
of the completion of the plans in a
letter a few days ago.
According to the plans i-e building
will be of brick, probably of a grey
color, with stone trimmings. It will
face Broadway and the main and only
public entrance will be on that street,
he building will be fireproof through
out, except the roof.
Out of the appropriation of $65,000
made by congress for the construction
of the postoffice building, $30,000 was
recently set aside to begin work with.

According to Hubert Friesinger the
burglars came into the city on an af

them. Everything possible was1
to close all possible avenues of escape.
Entrance to the store was
through the skylight on the roof. On£
of the panes of glass had been neatly
cut out and the roof ladder let "down,
through the opening, onto a display
table in the rew1 of the store. One pt
the' men went iiito the store in tMs
manner and the front and back doors
were then unlocked so as to make es

The men went to the statioh at
about 3 a. m., about ten minutes apart,
presumably to catch the early morning
train to Minneapolis. Hubert Friesin
ger followed the first man to the sta
tion and as the second one came near
the south water tank he was nabbed
by Night Patrolman Boyes. Boyes
brought his man to the station and
Friesinger then covered the other man.
Both were searched and revolvers of
large calibre were found on their per
son, indicating that they had meant to
make a success of the thing. They had
only three suitcases in their posses
sion when arrested, but upon being
questioned, admitted that they haci
hidden one behind a building near the
east approach to the Broadway bridge,
as it had proved too heavy to carry.
They had evidently expected to return
and get this case later. Th© men were
taken to the county jail and locked
up.
Upon being questioned by County
Attorney Rosenmeier they decided to
Elead
guilty to a charge of first degree
urglary, which they did before Judge
Parsons at 1 o'clock in the afternoon,
and received their sentence.
In court the men gave their names
as Lee Curtis and T. J. Murphy. The
former was about 52 years of age and
the latter 36. They stated that they
were from St. Paul. The latter admit
ted haying jserved a term in the feder
al penitentiary at Ft. Leavenworth,
Kansas, for a mail robbery. He said
that he was formerly engaged in the
dry goods business.
It is the opinion of-the local police
and of Mr. Wessel, proprietor of the
store, that the burglary was planned
several days in advance. Mr. Wessel
states that on Saturday night he saw
a man enter the alley at the rear of
the store and walk to the back door,
examine the transom and then disap
pear down the alley. Mr. Wessel gave
the matter but little thought at the
time but now is firm in the belief that
this man was one of the burglars. He
also remembers seeing a man enter the
store during the day Monday and no
ticed that the man examined the sky
light, but even then he thought noth
ing of the possibility of a robbery.
Friesinger is entitled to much credit
for his excellent work and complete
success in this affair. The burglars
are^ without question old timers and
their capture and conviction certainly
showed the ability of Mr. Friesinger
as a detective. He. was ably assisted
by the local night patrolmen, Richard
and Boyes. ^4

A partial eclipse of the sun was vis
ible here between 9 and 11 a. m., yes
terday. It could scarcely be seen with
the naked eye but wa$ easily dis
cernable with the aid of a colored or
smoked glass. The eclipse as seen here
covered about one-sixteenth of the

of the week in the interest of estab

the proposition to them. At the board
meeting Wednesday afternoon the
matter was brought up and the mem
bers expressed themselves as in favor
of it but they did not want to take
any definite action until they were
sure £hat the school would be attended
by. those who are in need of instruc

ed to see if enough persons could be
secured to attend to warrant establish

be held and one of the local teachers
will have charge of the work.

PRIMARY
The Minnesota state supreme court

the presidential preference primary
law, holding that tradition made it

The test suit was brought by W. N.
Carroll of Minneapolis,, a supporter of
Elihu Root for president. Boot re
fused to permit his name being used
and Carroll was thus unable to be a

IDECIDES TO HAVE BRIDGE RE
PAIRED BY PURCHASING MA
TERIAL AND HIKE LABOR
An adjourned session of the city?
council was held at the city hall Mon
day evening for the purpose of taking,
some action on the bids for the repair
ing of the north wagon bridge. After
some discussion it was decided to post
pone the matter to the following eve-,
ning and at that time it was decided,
to reject all the bids as they were
considered too high. The council then.,
decided to have the bridge repaired
by direct employment of labor and tho
(purchase of material made by the city...
This can be done now, since satisfac
tory bids could not be secured on the
work. The aldermen were of the opin
ion that several hundred dollars could
be saved in this manner. Tho county^
has agreed to pay one-third of the
cost and has appropriated a sum not
to exceed $500.00 for this purpose.
At the meeting Monday night a pe
tition was presented for a sewer on
Broadway to extend from the, west,
end of the postoffice lots to connect
with the end of the present sewer in,
front, of the Joslin building. This
sewer petition was the result of a pe
tition from the government asking for,
an ordinance permitting the construc
tion of a ,6rinch sewer on Broadway
from tliC i&stott^ t!» connect
with the old sewer. If th^ aewer ia.
constructed it "wiN not be necessary
for the government to build one. It
is feared that if the government sewen
is put in and the property owners
along the north side of $read,way
should desire to get sewer connections,,
trouble might arise, as the government
sewer would be in the way. The peti
tion was left until Tuesday evening in
order that the matter might be invest
igated. On Tuesday evening it waa
necessary to postpone, action on., it
again, owing to an error in the peti
tion. A new petition will very likely
be brought up at the regular monthly
meeting of tne council Monday eve
ning.

—WILL PLAY BEMIDJI TO
MORROW
Royalton's high school basketball
team comes up here today for a
game with the local high school team
at the high school gymnasium this
evening, beginning at 8:15.
The down-river town has a fast team
in the field this year and a good game
should be the result. A record crowd
should turn out and encourage the lo
cals and thus help them to victory.
The attendance at the games has been
very small in the past.
Coach Liljedahl expects to use prac
tically the same players in the game
this evening as were lined up against
Aitkin. They are practicing every
day and are getting in fine shape.
Tomorrow the local team will jour
ney. to Bemidji for a game with the
high school team of that city. This
game the locals are anxious to win as
Bemidji is one of the strongest teams
in this district.
