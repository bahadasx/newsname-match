SCHOOL NOTES
The box social held at the K. of
P. hall Thursday, January 27, was
a success. A short program was
rendered by the school children
and after that the boxes were auc
tioned off by Mr. McElgin. There
were far more boxes than gentle
men but, nevertheless, they were
all sold. The amount cleared was
$46, which will be used to defray
the expenses of the basket ball
team, and for material to' be used
in the physical training classes.
The girls' basket ball team will
go. to Clifton Friday afternoon,
February 4th. A large crowd could
accompany the team and root for
them. The game will be a hard one
and the girls would play much bet
ter to the tune of "Lordsburg,
Lordsburg, Rah! Rahl Rah!"
It would be a kindness to the
teachers and a protection to the
school grounds, if the parents
would remember that school does
not take up in the morning until
9 o'clock, nor in the afternoon un
til 1:15. Some of the children rush
home and eat their lunch and then
hasten back to the school grounds.
This results in accidents and quar
rels to the child and oft times
damage to school property. Co-operate
with us and keep the children
home until school time.
The Patron Society will have
their regular monthly meeting at
the school house next Thursday af
ternoon at 4 o'clock. Your presence
and ideas aré much in demand.
Try and come.
The scholars of the Sixth, Sev
enth and Eighth grades will com
pete for a prize, to be awarded the
best speller at the school house,
Friday afternoon, February 11, at
2:30. A large exhibit of indus
trial work should attract your at
tention. The children will work
with greater zeal if they have your
commendation.

Sad Accident at Deming'
Three sisters, Louise, Edna and
Sophronia Vallandigham, daugh-,
ters of E. R. Vallandigham. editor
of the Deming Headlight, were
instantly killed at 6:50 o'clock
Thursday evening of last week,
when the automobile in which
they were riding was struck by a
Santa Fe railway coal car propel
led by a switch engine at Deming,
New Mexico. George Lntchet,
linotype operator of The Deming
Headlight print shop, was driving
the car and he had a leg and an
arm mangled and received injury
internally, from which he may not
recover. Mr. Vallandigham, who
was also in the car, escaped with
only a few bruises. The accident
occurred at the railway crossing
near the freight depot.
The railway crossing tender,
who was the first to reach the
spot, declares that he blew his
whistle and waved his lantern
when the machine approached
the crossing. He said the auto
mobile hesitated, but started
across the tracks just as the
switch engine shunted the coal
car over it. The machine was
struck full in the side and com
pletely demolished. The three
young ladies were hurled to the
ground, striking with such force
that their death was a matter of
moments.
When the crossing tender
reached the victims he found
that Mr. Crichet had a broken
ankle, a broken arm and what
aDDeared to internal injuries.
Mr. Vallandigham was bruised
and dazed. His escape is con
sidered little short of miraculous.
The Vallandigham girls were
well known in this section and
highly popular. The eldest, Miss
Louise, was 19 and a teacher in
the public schools at Deming.
Mis3 Edna, aged 16, was a senior
in the local high school, and the
youngest, Sophronia, was a pupil
in the grammar school. Mr.
Vallandigham is one of the most
prominent newspaper men in
New Mexico. The family "home
is two miles from Deming.
VICTIMS OF AUTO
ACCIDENT BURIED
The funeral of the Misses Lou
ise. Edna and Sophronia Vallan-
dicham was held in Deming Sun
day morning at 11 o'clock. The
effect of tne fatal accident which
resulted in the death of the young
ladies was manifested everywhere
in the solemn demeanor of the citi
zens and the large numbers which
assembled at the Methodist church
long before the funeral hour. Ev
ery automobile and conveyance in
the little city which was available
wa3 pressed into service to carry
the mourning throngs.
The services were conducted by
Rev. E. C. Morgan, Methodist pas
tor, who was assisted by practical
ly all the local ministers. His ser
mon made a deep impression on all
those who were able to gain admit
tance to the church. Special music
was provided by the schoolmates of
the dead girls, assisted by the
members of their Sunday school
class. Their class mates acted as
pall bearers. The floral remem
brances were numerous and beau
tiful and were a silent tribute to
the high esteem in which the de
parted were held. All arrange
ments were in the hands of the Odd
Fellows wno attended the funeral
in a body. The processon to Moun
tain View Cemetery where inter
ment was made was one of the
largest ever witnessed in this part
of the state.
The physicians at the hospital
deemed it inadvsable to permit the
father of the children, E. R. Val
landigham, to attend the funeral.
wheh might have seriously imped
ed his final recovery.
George Crichet Dies
George Crichet, who was so ter
rbily injurea at the time of the fa
tal collision, died at the Ladies'
Hospital in Deming shortly after
noon Wednesday. At no time did
the attending physicians encour
age his friends or relatives to ex
pect his recovery. He rallied re
peatedly, nowever, and while at
times there seemed a bare possi
bility that he might live his splen
did physique was unable to cope
with the strain that had been put
upon it, and he sank into a state of
coma, from which he never roused

Mother and Baby Drowned
Copper Era of Clifton, Arizona,
says: A communication received
from the ranch of J. II. T. Cosper
gives the sad account of the
drowning of Mrs. Delia Reynolds
and baby, 19 months old, in the
Blue river, January 16th. The
accident occurred three miles be
low the ranch of Mr. Cosper.
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds and
their three little children were
residents of Luna, New Mexico.
They had been on a visit to the
parents of Mrs. Reynolds, Mr.
and Mrs. Isaacs, at Animas, New
Mexico, and were returning to
Luna, travelling up the Blue in a
wagon when they encountered
the high water.
They were compelled to abandon
their wagon at the Base line Ran
ger Station and attempted con
tinue the rest of the journey on
horse back. While crossing the
Blue a short distance below the
Cosper ranch, the horse carrying
Mrs. Reynolds and the youngest
child in some way fell in the
water and before Mr. Reynolds
could give assistance the horse,
wife and baby were swept down
the river. Mr. Reynolds later
3aw the horse some distance be
low washed out on a sand bar.
Mr. Reynolds took the remaining
children and went to the Cosper
ranch with the sad news. J. H.
T. Cosper, his sons Dewitt and
Wain, and D. Hale and two Mexi
cans started in haste for the
place. In the meantime the river
was rising rapidly. In making
a close search they jouno me
horse about one half mile below
and about one milo further on
found the body of Mrs. Reynolds.
Bv this time it was 4 o'clock and
pouring down rain and the river
rising so rapidly tnac it was im
possible to make a further search
for the child. Mr. Cosper man
aged to tret the body of the
drowned woman to his ranch at
about. 6 o'clock by swimming
several places. The river con
tinued to rise for three days
which rendered it impossible to
make any search for the child
which will very likely never be
found.
Mrs. Reynolds was buried at
the Cosper ranch on January 1,
by the request of her husband.

Credit, Big Thing In Business,
Helped by Pay-Up Week
THE late E. H. Harrimnn, wizard of finance,' once said: 1
' never particularly considered a man who is worth ft million.
The man I like to talk to, the mn with whom I like to do
business, is the mari who can go out and borrow a couple of hun
dred thousand dollar any time he want it."
There's a volume of wisdom in thi urntpnc. It means that in
the business world credit is the one big thing. Once a man lose
his credit in business he lias a hard tim to uccccd. He pays the
penalty in other ways. There may come an opportunity for an
enlargement of his enterprise. There may come a chance to get
soods cheaply for cash. If he stands right at the bank he can
borrow. If ho stands right with his neighbor he can borrow from
them. The moral is obviou.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN A LAGGARD IN YOU (I PAYMENTS YOU
