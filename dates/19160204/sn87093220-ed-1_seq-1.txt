Fight Still Rages
Over Location of
Federal Structure
The fight started last week, following
the activities of those who circulated
a petition to the U. S. treasury depart
ment, asking that the new federal
building be not erected on the G street
site, shows no signs of abating in its
fierceness. Each side stands to Its
guns and thunders in communications
to the daily press, seemingly without
furthering either cause.
From the trend of street discussion
iit would seem that the majority of
Aberdeen people deplore the fu3s,
mainly because they fear that it will
result in an indefinite postponement
of work by the government on the
postoffice building. Press dispatches,
on the other hand, indicate the govern
ment will go ahead with its plans for
|»uilding the G street site.
The petition favoring retention of
the Benn site will be held open by
E. B. Benn until Saturday evening,
when it will be forwarded to Washing
ton, D. C., with, as estimated by Mr.
Benn, all of 3,000 signatures.
Jewelry Store of
Thomas Will Move
Into Finch Building
||> —
Thomas' Jewelry store, the oldest
establishment of its kind in the Grays
Harbor county, will move into the cor
ner store of the Finch building some
time during the next sixty days. Mr.
Thomas in securing this location un
doubtedly has the most centrally and
best store room In Aberdeen.
Mr. Thomas' strong conviction that
e stock carried by him is by all
Adds the largest, most complete and
in Southwest Washington,
accounts for his securing this very
fine location. He is simply conforming
|p the requirements of his business.

FREES CLEARED
~ BUT DEFENSE'S
f v CLAIM DENIED
Frank Frees, charged with viola
tion of the "dry" law, was cleared
Monday before Police Judge C». R.
■ Snider. Frees is alleged to have
li#ught a pint of alcohol from a lo
cat pharmacy for massage purposes,
wltliout a physician's prescription.
His defense was that massage is a
mechanical, not a medicinal, use of
alcohol. The court ruled the conten
-«n wrong, but held that the drug
. , and not the purchaser, was to
f 1 ae /or selling under the circum
jiceß.

Fewer Arrests Here
Forty-eight arrests made in Janu

80 made in January, 1915, looks like
some benefits accruing from the "dry"
regime.
