Gang Working on Tracks,
At Westbrook. "
Westbrook, Conn., Feb. 4. One man
was killed and, two others seriously, if
not fatally, injured here today by be
ing hit by a light engine, running west
over the New York, New Haven and
Hartford railroad.-- 1 All three men
probably were members of the section
bang Of thisdislp-ict or extra men hired
since the snowstorm."
The " accident happened at Eafst
brldge. A freight train was running
east and the light engine west and ap
parently the three men, who were
walking east-, stepped off one track
just in time to be struck by the light
engine: One man, who had ticket 387
m his clothing, was struck and rolled
about 12 yards under the engine pilot.
The engine - was stopped and the fire
man held the injured' man while tne
engine backed so that he could be ex
tricated. But this man, supposed to
he R. Sammi, died a little later. The
other men, who had cards 385 and
388, were very badly hurt - and after
being attended by Dr. Grannis, of Say
hrook,; and' T. - Reynolds of Clinton,
they were placed on express No. 8 1
and taken, to New London. "
The difficulty in identifying the men
is due to the fact that yesterday the
section foreman, named Maloney, whose
home is in Passaic, N. J., got permis
sion to go there to move his household
effects to Westbrook. He knows the
regular members of his gang, six in
number, but it is not known how many
he engaged to help in snow removal.
Two members of the gang, father

MRS. MOHR SOBS
AS HER LAWYERS
MAKE LAST, PLEA
Providence, Feb. " 4 Final argu
ments were made today in the trial
of Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mohr, C. Victor
Brown and Henry H. Spell man, for
the murder of Dr. C. Franklin Mohr.
It is expected that the case will go to
the Jury tomorrow. .-.
John J. Fitzgerald, of counsel for
Mrs. Mohr, declared in his argument
that the state had ' "subjected his
clfent to an injustice" in its refusal
to permit her to be tried alone. The
prosecution, he said,' had attempted
to show four- motives behind its
charge that she had hired three ne
groes to kill her husband, none of
which, he contended, had been es
tablished. These were jealousy, re
venge, a desire to - get possession of
the doctor's 'money and fear of di
vorce suit possibilities.
Mr. Fitzgerald was particularly, se
vere - in his discission of the testi-.
mony of George W. Rocks and Miss
Florence Ormsby. Referring to Mrs.
Mohr, who was in tears, Mr. Fitzger
ald said that several of the witnesses
for the prosecution "have been
shouting 'crucify her.' "

"Wait in Vain For Cars
About Bridgeport.
Fire in the Connecticut Co. trolley
barns on Congress street, which dam
aged overhead wires in the shells,
caused a tie-up of early morning cars
today. Though j the blaze is - said to
have been checked by trolley company
employes before it had done much
damage to the building or cars, great
difficulty was experienced in replacing
feed' wires to run cars out and. upon
the street lines.
An attempt to patch the wires tem
porarily was only partially successful
and failed just as the need for cars
was most pressing ' this morning, ac
cording to General . Manager Charles
H. Chapma'n.
Between 5 and -8 o'clock today
many, persons waited patiently i for
cars in the outskirts of the city and
roundly condemned the company.
Manager Chapman declares that full
service will be maintained on schedule

That German Contention
Will Be Upheld.

Berlin To Demand That

Prize Court Decides.
Washington, Feb. 4 Secretary
Lansing indicated today that the
United States had decided to hold that
the Prussian-American treaty govern
the case of the Appam, as Germany
contends, and that all that remained
to be decided was the interpretation
of the application of the treaty's
terms.
The secretary disclosed further that
the sole question to be decided by
the interpretation was how long the
Appam should be permitted to re
main in American waters. The treaty
guarantees to a German prize th
right to come and go freely. If the
Appam were forced" to depart she
would becpme the prey of British
cruisers assembling outside the Vir
ginia capes. If f o-ced to depart, Ger
man officials have stated the ship
-would be sunk to prevent her recap-
ture by the British.
Germany is expected to contend
that Hie treaty guarantee the Appam
the right to remain safe in Hamp
ton roads-Tintil the case goes before
a nrize court for adjudication. Tech
nically, the shipvdoes not become Ger
many's prize ' until such a court es
tablishes the validity of her captors.

Newport: -News. Va., Feb. 4 Only
Lieut. Berg and his small prize crew
remained today aboard the former
British passenger steamer Appam
brought into these neutral waters last
Tuesday as a prize of war. The liner's
nassengers and original' ship's com
pany, taken prisoners when the steam
er was captured by a mysterious Ger
man raider off the Canary Islands,
Jan. 15, were liberated last night by
order of the United States govern
ment. The passengers today were aboard
the Old; Dominion, liner Jefferson, en
route for New York where they were
expeeted to arrive early tonight. The
members of the crew, with the gun
pointers taken from other British
steamers which the raider sank be
fore the Appam was overhauled, -were
in Norfolk awaitlngthe sailing of an
other .New York steamer tonight. .
The Appam is to remain at this
port until the Washington government
decides what disposition b& her shall
be made whether "she shall be held
a fair prize of her German captors
under the Prussian-American treaty
or returned to her British owners un
de The Hague convention. No guard
has been placed over the vessel 'by the
United States, reliance being placed
in ' the word of Lieut. Berg that the

have been decided.
IG BLAZE WAS
CAUSED BY GAS
BOMB, IS BELIEF
Fire Department Officials
Suspect Incendiary Mis
sile Was Used.
Investigation of the blaze that gut
ted three buildings on Broad "street.
between John and Cannon streets.
Wednesday, night, leads the fire offi
cials of Bridgeport to believe that a
chemically . timed gaseous powder
bomb similar to those used in the
present war was the cause of fire.
Lieut. Thomas F. Broderick, de
tailed as inspector of combustibles,
declared today that he believed this
bomb may have been placed near the
foot of the staircase several days or
even a week ago and probably not by
anyone connected with the billiard
academy. '
James Freeman of Holyoke was
closely questioned in St. Vincent's
hospital by Lieutenant Broderick to
day. He admitted that he is what
technically may be termed a
"floater," or one who goes from city
to city for work that he may 'see the
sights.
According to his own statements, he
came from Holyoke on a freight train
the morning of the fire. He applied
for work at the Remington factory
and later procured a promise of em
ployment at the Pembroke launcj-y
in Madison avenue. He drank con
siderably during the afternoon and
fell, asleep in the billiard parlor.
Freeman remembers being awaken

LAKE DESIGNS
SUBMARINE TO
CARRYFREIGHT
Noted Inventor Obtains Pati
ents on New Type of s
Undersea Vessels.
SWEEPING RIGHTS
GIVEN TO PATENTEE
Unusually Broad Powers
Are Conferred Upon Local
Manufacturer.
An undersea, cargo-carrying boat, so
unique in design that every claim
asked by Simon- Lake in his original
request to the Patent office has been
allowed , without change, has been pot
en ted by the noted submarine de
signer. . "- . .
.This fact, in itself1 most unusual, is no
less unique than the boat Itself which
is a submarine with two hulls outside
and inside no armament and capable
of carrying grains,' foodstuffs or other
material beneath a blockading fleet
and into a beleaguered port.
No navy is known today to have
such a vessel although It has been
suspected that German cargo-carrying
f undersea- boats have been utilized in
the present war.
One of the marked features, and
possibly one of Simon Lake's most
useful inventions is the method of ob
taining quick "trim" and fore and
aft stability under varying loading
conditions. ;
According to., patent 1,169,970 for sub
marine boats granted by the - United
States government February 1. 1916,
through the local office of Patent a t
torney Mercer D. . BlondellLake has
so arjrangod a series of tanks and bal
last compartments that water-hallast
may be admitted into the very interior
of the vessel's compartments and
around the' cargo Itself without injury
td the contents or danger to the crew.
This method, is novel and makes for
quick stability and submersion even
while the -cargo ,-is being loaded. It
w)ll be seen readily that in loading
the ordinary vessel, cargo of various
specific gravity is placed in tne noias.
This is later "trimmed" or. so read-
Justed -that the water line of the ves
sel and the list to right or left may
become level before the - vessel is : put
under way. By Lake's plan of allow
ing water directly into the boat he is
able to quickly obtain this "trim" and
to .rest submerged upon an even keel.
His method is by having an outside
and an Inside hull, both of pressure
resisting material.. He carries all
his cargo in hermetically sealed con
tainers similar to huge milk cans
whioh' may be filled with material and
surrounded by water ballast neces
sary, t
Though the prompt granting of this
patent, without change of the original
application papers submitted by Mr.
Lake through Mercer Blondell, has
given rise in submarine circles at
Washington to the belief that the gov
ernment may propect the building of
such undersea carriers, local boat
boat builders would not sanction, state
ments that such a plan is conceived
by the United' States..

LEGALITY OF ATTACK IS UPHELD
Berlin, Feb. 4 plnformation reaching the Associated Press
today indicates that under no circumstances will Germany ad
mit that the sinking of the Lusitania was an illegal act.
. .,' The new instructions forwarded to Ambassador Von Bern-,
storff, according tt this information, contains simply one phrase,
of the new formulation of the proposed note of regret for the
sinking of the Lusitania. v . v
The suggested sentence is short, consisting of on-ly eight
words and does not contain the word "illegal." It represents-,
the extreme limit of Germany's concessions in the Lusitania
case. ' "- :. ' ' , ,-
The viw is entertained here that one of the most serious
erisis of the war has arisen in connection with the Lusitania
case and that it is impossible to foresee the outcome from any
indications here. V
The result of the negotiations appears to hingef solely on
the one word "illegal." ' .
' In the way of an agreement between the United States and
Germany stand only these seven letters, expressing the concep
tion which President Wilson and Secretary Lansing insist must
be embodied in the German formula expressing regret for the
loss of American liyes abpard the Gunarder. The Associated
Press is "informed authoritatively that Germany cannot and will
not designate as illegal the sinking oT a liner by iany submarine.
. Virtually no other difficulties in the way of the settlement
remain, and the new instructions forwarded to Ambassador Von
Bernstorff on Tueseday contain merely the new formula by
which it is hoped to satisfy Washington without humiliating this
country- Although the suggested sentence according to a re
liable version, consists of only eight words and does not contain
the word illegal" or characterize the sinking .of the Lusitania.
as such, it goes otherwise to the furthest extent possible toward.
meeting the American desires.
, Says Situation is Grave. .
. rr. Alfred Zimmerman, under-sec-retatry
for foreign affairs, in an inter-
view with the Associated Press, ex
pressed the hope that the new formula
forwarded to Ambassador Von Bern
storff would offer a possible basis of
settlement.
- However, he made no effort to con
ceal the gravity of the situation, and
was most explicit in his statement that
Germany . had reached, the extreme
unilt of concessions and under no cir
cumstances would concede the illegal
ity of .her submarine campaign ii the

everything in its power and has done

BERLIN PAPERS SEE GRAVEST
ASPECT TO LUSITANIA CASE
Berlin, Feb. 4, via London 12:50 p.
m. German-American tension was
again reflected on the Bourse, prices
declining moderately in general but
war stocks tnore Sharply. The after
noon newspapers for the most part
abstain from discussion of the case,
one exception being the Lokal An
zeiger. In a column editorial, this paper
mya that a very grave situation has
Seen caused by the Washington gov
ernment suddenly insisting that Ger
.nany declare the sinking of the Lusi
ania Illegal" and apparently suspend
tg the negotiation of all other unad
asted matters until such a declara
on be given, the situation therefore
ly, but he left no doub-t that the whole
crisis centered on Secreary Lansing's :
demand that Germany disavow the
pinking of the Lusitania as an act
contrary to international law.
1 The under-secretary declared re
peatedly that Germany could not pos
sibly admit this procedure was illegal,
or make concessions which virtually'
would take the submkrine weapon out
of her hands. He asserted again and
again that if . the United States de
sired . to drive matters to a breach
Germany codld go no further to avoid .
it, and that the breach, with all its la
mentable consequences, must (Some.
The most regrettable phase of the
situation, .he asserted, was that there
existed no really important reason for
a breach, no conflicts of Interests be
tween Germany and the United Sti.tes..
Germany, he said, ws counting on
reciprocal development of trade with
America after the war. ' ,
These hopes would be dashed or at
any rate their development would be
hampered greatly, if a breach were to
come now; but Germany would do no
more.
Dr. Zimm merman evidently believes,
Germany now has in the submarine a
highly effective weapon for use against .
England. When reminded that even
experts had' disagreed previously on
this point, he replied: ..
"Yes, . I used to think that way, but
now I have changed my mind."
nowilooklng like "bend or break"
Germany, declare the newspaper,
has shown by indisputable facts that,
she cherishes a sincere wish to live In
peace wlth the United States. There
has been no lack of words with a
friendly ring from that side, it adds,
but all the world now has "only one
opinion of what American neutrality .
really means."
The newspaper says that the Ger
man government still hopes that a de
finite understanding is within reach
of the basis of the latest questions to
