of her " face. Her" family tad peeri
rich once. They had bad estates !&
Louisiana; but the war had reduced
them to poverty, and Lily Ammt waa
i stenographer before her marriage.
Sum had never seen Mr. Trent. H
Only ktiew that his name was the
word rrted try Ammt to cow the spirit
of bfs beautiful wife. He suspected
that Lily Ammt had loved Mr. Trent
before her manjage, and he suspect
ed, too, that h had married the
waMiy man to bring" sipme comforts
to her ttffctf parents. B9t Sara only
suspected; and b was toT loyal a
servant to voice his suspicions, even
to himself.
He had noticed a shabby teller who
haunted the street, and often flood
staring up at the windows, particularly
Ifi tbe evenings. ,
Saffl could not help seeing the rnall.
and he recognized the writing of cer
tain letters very well. He was at hi
wits' end how to proceed. Once he
caught the shabby man attempting to
enter the house in the guise of a gas
inspector. Just after the postman
called. The man had the mail In hi
hand when Sam collared him and
pushed him into the street.
"Sam," said his mistress, "you can
start on your vacation tomorrow."
"Yes, ma'am, thank you," aid Sam.
"You can take your two full weeks.
amf yoir money " i
"Oh, Lord, Mis' Ammt, I don't want
to go now," said Sam Imploringly.
His look might hare melted a atone.
but Mrs. Ammt was seized wlthfnry.
"I'm tired of your spying abont me,"
she cried, stamping her foot. "I tell
you to go and afterward you can re
port to Mr. Ammt for instructions." ,'
"Yes, ma'am," said Sam humbly.
He went after breakfast, but waa
back at his poet that afternoon. He
came In at an hour when he knew hie
mistress would be out, and tbe servant
engaged. He came in softly through
the front door, with his mistress' apare
key, and went to his room. Nobody
would be likely to trouble him there,
or to suspect hie presence. "
It was a big house. The servants
downstairs could not hear what went
on In the drawing rooms. But Sam'a
ears heard the unmistakable but soft
click of a key In the latch. He wa
down the stairs like a panther, be-'
fore the man who was coming up had
reached the top of the first flight. And
yet, swiftly as he moved, ha bad
caught a glimpse of Lily Ammt, seated
upon the lounge under tbe electric
light, pretending to read, and waiting
for the man whom she loved with all
her heart.
He knew, too, that the shabby
man was somewhere in the street
opposite.
Sam's voice rose loud at the head
of the first flight of stairs.
"Mis' Amint's very sorry, Mr. Trent,
sir," said Sam. "She's very sorry eh
can't see you this evening. You see,
sir, Mr. Ammt'a away on business,
sir."
Sam's heart almost melted as be
looked into the despairing face of the
man in front of him. Upstairs he
heard the rustle of the pages cease,
and he knew that Lily Ammt had
heard.
"Mr. Ammt asked me to say how
sorry he was, sir," continued Sam,
standing Implacably In front of
Trent.
"He did, eh?" stammered Trent
"Who the dickens are you?"
"Why, I'm Sam, sir," answered Sam.
"Never bad any other name, I reckon.
Don't you remember seeing me, sir,
when you called on Mr. and Mis'
Ammt last month? It was me handed
you the cigar box, sir."
As the man turned away and began
to descend the stairs Sam followed
him. In the hall he looked up at him
Imploringly. "You see, air. Mis' Lily's
my charge, sir," he said. "Asking your
pardon, sir. Some day, sir, I hope to
serve you both, sir."
Trent swung round on him. "You're
right!" he said in a broken voice. "I
shan't forget you, Sam."
"No, sir," said Sam, as he opened
the door and saw the shabby man
lounging near. "And Mis' Ammt'a.
sorry she can't receive you tonight,
sir, on account of Mr. Ammt being
away, sir."
But when the door closed he turned
to see Lily Ammt standing behind
him.
"You dear you dear black gentle
man," sobbed Uly Ammt. That scared
Sam more than anything that had hap
pened before.
