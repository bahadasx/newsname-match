UNITED STATES
READY FOR WAR
Chicago, Feb. 1.-The United States
has made preparation for immediate
war, as far as the navy is concerned,
although the present naval force is in
adequate in size, President Wilson de
clared in an address before several
thousand persons in the Auditorium
here.
"We mean business," he said, in
speaking of the preparedness plans of
the administration.
"We have given to the present fleet
of the United States an organization
such as it has never had before, I am
told by Admiral Fletcher," the presi
dent said, "and we have made prepa
ration for immediate war so far as the
navy is concerned."
The army, the president said, as at
present constituted, "is not large
enough even for the ordinary duties
of peace."
The president repeated his warnings
that no time must be lost in strength
ening the defenses of the nation.
"When I see some of my fellow citi
zens spread tinder where the sparks
cre falling I wonder what their ideal
of Americanism is," he said. Ameri
ca, the president said, has been cruel
ly misjudged by the nations at war.
"I know that on the other side of
the water there has been a great deal
of cruel misjudgment with regard for
the reasons why America has remain
ed neutral. Those looking at us from
a distance do not feel the strong
pulses of ideals and principles that are
in us.
"They do not feel the conviction of
America that our mission is a mission
of peace and that righteousness can
not be maintained as a standard in
tie midst of arms. They do not
realize that back of all our energy we
are a body of idealists much more
ready to lay down our lives for a
thought than for a dollar.
"They suppose, some of them, that
we are holding off because we can
make money while others are dying
the most cruel misunderstanding that
any nation has ever had to face-so
wrong that it s.ents almost useless to
try to correct it, uecause it shows that
the very fundamentals of our life are
not comprehended or understood."
Rulers, not public opinion, brought
about the present war. Mr. Wilson de
clared.
"I thank God there is no man in the
United States who has the authority
to bring war without the consent of
the nation," he said.
The task of the United States, he
said, is to assert the principles of law
in a world in which the principles of
law have broken down.
"We are not now thinking of in
vasion of the territory of the United
States," the president declared. "That
is not what is making us think. We
are not asking ourselves shall we be
prepared only to defend our own
homes and our own shores."
GLAD HAND AT MILWAUKEE
Milwaukee. Feb. 21.-The largest
crowds that have yet turned out to
hear the president on his present tour
faced him as he entered the Auditor
ium here. The three-quarters of a
mile drive from his hotel was between
dense crowds that blocked all side
walk traffic. Although the air was
chill and a raw wind whipped over
the city the president made the trip in
an open car.
Meantime an audience of 9,000 had
been waiting, some of them for hours.
The police estimated that 5,000 were
turned away.
When the president arrived the
crowd stood and cheered. The band
played "America." The committee of
;00 on the stage started to sing, the
president joining and the big house
caught the air and joined in the
chorus.
Mrs. Wilson occupied a box near the
stage with Dr. Grayson. She wore a
magnificent bouquet of orchids.
"I want at the outset to remove any
misopprehension in your minds," said
the president. "There is no crisis;
nothing new has happened."
INDIANS RESTORED TO ROLL
Washington, Feb. 1.-Gus Beaulieu,
B3en Fairbanks and eighty-six other
Minnesota Indians will be restored to
the roll of the Chippewas as a result
of a ruling by the attorney general.
Beaulieu, Fairbanks and the others
concerned were removed from the roll
and their annuities stopped as a re
sult of representations made .sme
mionths ago by Special Agent Birch s?
Ihe department of justice.
PITH AND POINT.
Haste makes some people waste a lot
of other people's time.
Too bad the trouble huntei doesn't
have to take out a license.
The movement toward seeing terra
firma first is receiving a powerful im
petus in merchant nariue circles.
The sixth sense that a scientist says
some men have is probably common
sense, but only some men have it.
All sides are confident of victory
when the war ends. Some of it is
plainly confidence misplaced, as the
events will show.
More Potato Money
The Banking Corporation of Helena
offers through the state fair a special
premium on potatoes exhibited at the
1916 fair. For the ten largest and best
potatoes exhibited, regardless of va
riety, provided that each lot of ten po
tatoes must be of one variety, exclusive
of all other lots or special premiums,
$100 in gold is to be given as follows;
First, $75; second, $15; third, $10.
"Potatoes will be jndged on the basis
of commercial value. Commercial
value takes into consideration the true
ness of type of a particular kind or
variety, the preparation given speci
mens for exhibit, and their condition
at the time of judging."
THREE THROUGH ROADS
TIED UP WITH SNOW
Three transcontinental railroads run
ning into Seattle and Tacoma are com
pletely tied up on account of heavy
snows in the Cascade mountains, where
it is said the snow lies 30 feet deep. In
Seattle a foot of snow lies on the
ground and it is said this has not hap
pened before in twenty years.
It is almost certain that the first
warm southwest wind will be accom
panied by devastation in the mountains
and valleys and preparations are now
being made to protect lives and prop
erty.
LAWRENCE URGES FARMERS
TO SOW BEST SELECTED SEED
I see no reason why the quality of
grains grown around Ronan should not
be the equal of that grown, anywhere
in this state. I certainly believe the
types of cereals grown at St. Ignatius
that made such a remarkable showing
at the state fair and State Seed Show
this year will do just as well here,
therefore I earnestly recommend that
your farmers plant these same types
of wheat, barley and oats.
We must get rid of the large number
of varieties of wheat that has been
planted.by the ranchers the past four
years. A large percentage of this
year's crop was a mixture of seven
wheats, commonly called "Duke's
Mixture," and a great deal of poor
Bluestem and Fife. None of this pro;
duct grades very high, the fixed charges
in growing it is just as high as the
types of wheat which grade higher
and if clean and rich in color, sell at a
big advance for seed purposes, so there
can be no object in raising poor quality
grains and no excuse now about in
ability to get seed to plant. The local
merchants can supply our needs. I do
not advise sending away for seed grain.
We import weed seed and only add to
the already too numerouus varieties of
grain already grown here.
In spring wheats I recommend the
Marquis, an early maturing, marvelous
yielder and good hard milling wheat.
From 40 to 57 bushels to the acre was
obtained in different parts of the coun
try this year. The St. Ignatius Scotch
Fife and the Gold Sheaf Fife are the
next best hard spring varieties. The
Stanley and Northwest Bluestem for
soft wheat and Kubauka Macaroni can
be planted for variety.
The Roosevelt is our best dry land
oat. The Swedish Select, Prince Royal
or Scottish Chief are all heavy and
good yielders under irrigation. These
varieties do best with us and no others
should be used.
Oderbrucker and Blue Boy 6 Row,
and Guy Mayle Hulless are our best
barleys.
All the varieties mentioned are the
highest priced and best sellers on the
market today and they grow to per
fection here. With them we have won
sweeping victories at the state fair
and seed shows. Those who plant
them will reap the profits which this
kind of advertising brings. As it is
now, we cannot supply the outside dc
mand. All our meritorious grain is
held by local dealers for home planting.
I strongly urge every farmer to plant
all he can of these varieties, as I am
sure a good premium will be paid for
them next yaar.

STOUT WILL QUIT
AT END OF TERM
Congressman Tom Stout of Lewis
town, has decided that he would rather
live in his home town and edit his news
paper than to live in Washington as a
congressman. He announced his pros
pective retirement from congress last
Friday by issuing the following state
ment:
"I have determined not to become a
candidate for re-election. My reasons
are purely personal. My wife and I
would rather live in Montana than
Washington.
"Montana people have been mighty
good to me and I have attempted to
repay their generosity by devoting my
full time to representing them here at
the nation's capitol. If I believed I
am the only person available who could
adequately perform the duties of this
office, I would be willing to lay aside
personal considerations and stick with
the job, but there are scores of good
men in Montana who can represent the
interest of the state at Washington
with as much fidelity and doubtless
greater distinction than I.
"My future plans contemplate noth
ing more than going back to Lewis
town, resuming the job as editor of my
newspaper and taking only such part in
public affairs as every good citizen
should deem it his duty to take in the
development and upbuilding of a thriv
ing, progressive community. "
Will the Hon. John M. Evans take
the hunch and do likewise?
COUNTY AGRICULTURIST
WILL BE NAMED THIS WEEK
According to the Missoulian, the
county commissioners have decided to
continue the employment of a county
agriculturist this year and the selection
of a man to fill tnis position will be
made this week.
Last fall the Society of Equity of
this county adopted a resolution favor
ing the discontinuance of such an agent,
but since then the same society has
reversed itself and requested the com
missioners to make proper provisious
for an agent for 1916. The commis
sioners being of the opinion that an
agriculturist of ability and merit will
be of material assistance to the farm
ers, have decided to employ ,one, and
in order to meet the requirements of
the state board it is necessary to make
the final decision this week, which, it
is understood, has been done.
Later:---J. R. Campbell of Lake
Crystal, Minnesota, has been selected
as county agriculturist for this county.
His duties will commence on March 1st
and after that time his services will he
at hand for the farmers of Missoula
county.
NEWSIN MONTANA
"The workmen's compensation law
seems to me to be proving a decided
success," said A. H. Spriggs, chairman
of the state accident insurance board,
in an interview at the Thornton hotel
at Butte. "The law has been in oper
ation for seven months. More than
$300,000 lhis been paid by employers
on death claims and claims for 4,000
minor injuries have been compensat
ed. The number of beneficiaries un
der death claims has been 13(1 and
there has not been one legal action
briught."
Mr. Spriggs continued regarding the
new law:
"The law Is working splendidly so
far as Butte is concerned. The cost
to the employers is no greater than
ever and now they know just what
they have to pay out every month,
while in the past they never knew till
the end of a lawsuit, which was ex
pensive in itself. The laboring people
are doing much better under it, for
they get it all now instead of divid
ing with attorneys."
Mr. Spriggs paid a high compli
ment to the safety first system in op
eration in the Iutte mines and said
dhat it was decidedly redn-ing the
number of injuries to employes and
greatly lessening the cost to the com
panies.
Asked If the charges of undertak
ers had become reasonable MIr
Spriggs said that they had, generally
speaking, and that the bourd has
ceased to receive the exorbitant
claims once sent In. Said Mr. Spriggs!
"Publicity stopped that. The news
papers made It unpopular and it Is
stopped now."
This was an abuse at the beginning
that caused much adverse criticism.
In one case a laborer was buried in
silks and the undertaker scnt in a
bill for $45 for a silk burial suit, $6
for silk slippers and $2 for silk stock
ings.
FEW IDLE MEN IN STATE
'T'hat Montana will not be confront
ed with a labor problem the present
winter is indicated in the announce
ment made at Helena by Chief Inmnui
gration Inspector L. T. Plummer that
thus far this month but thirteen appli
cations for work have been filed with
the federal labor agency, whose head
quarters are in Helena.
All last winter an average of 130
applications a month were received
by the federal labor bureau and for a
time it was impossible to supply the
jobs which were so eagerly sought.
This year, however, there are but few
men out of work.
Of the thirteen applications which
have been received this month by the
federal bureau eleven were from men
in Eastern states who are now em
ployed but who want to come to Mon
tana to locate permanently.
BRAVERY AVERTS ACCIDENT
Through the bravery of W. C.
t)'llrien, a Northern Paciflic car clerk,
an explosion which would undoubtedly
have wrecked the city of Helena, was
narrowly averted.
A car of giant powder in a train
load of twenty-two cars, containing
dy namito and nitroglycerin, caught
fire in some unaccountable manner
while lying in the freight yards. See
ing the fire O'Brien rushed to the
burning car, uncoupled it and obtain
ed a freight engine to rush the burn
ing twenty-one cars to a point of
safety. Only the one boxcar of giant
powder and one empty box car were
destroyed.
BURGLARS LOOT POOLHALL
Secure $75 in Cash, Gold Pieces and
Merchandise.
Approximately $75 in cash, gold
pieces and merchandise was appropri
ated from the Lobby poolroom at Dil
lon by burglars, who secured an en
trance to the place by means of the
cellar door. The burglars, who evi
dently had an Intimate knowledge of
the interior of the. place, confiscated
the contents of the cash register and
secured some gold pieces from a raffle
board and several meerschaum pipes,
etc. The loss was discovered In the
morning when one of the employes
opened the pool hall to clean out.
Serious Blaze at Hinsdale.
Practically the whole of the business
district in Hinsdale was destroyed by
fire which started in the electric light

thousand dollars. Not even a stamp
remained at the postofilce. Other
places destroyed were the Wellon
store, the Hinsdale electric power
house, a millinery shop, the office of
the Hinedale Tribune, a meat market
and other small stores.

RAILROADS OF MONTANA
ANTICIPATE HIGH WATER
Whenithe cold snap breaks, and it will
-sometime-unusually high water in
Montana streams is anticipated by the
railroad men. There is said to be more
snow in the mountains now than in
many years past and should it go oil
with a rush, serious floods are sure to
result.
The management of all railroads
operating in the state are making
elaborate preparations to protect their
track from the water that is sure to
rush out of the hills and mountains
when the snow begins to melt. It is
said the snow lies from six to ten feet
deep on the level in western Montana,
while the fall in the mountains of the
eastern part of the state has not been
equalled in years.
LANSING TAKES
FIRM POSITION
Washington, Feb. 1.-The United
States has shut off completely any
hope of a. settlement of the Lusitanis
controversy with Germany throug'i
the machinery of international arbi.
trat ion.
This fact, obtained from an official
source, indicates the extent to which
Secretary Lansing has bared the mail
ed fist in his demand for an uncondi
tional disavowal by Germany.
The refusal to arbitrate, it is learn
ed, is based on the ground that, the
"vital interests and national honor"
of the United States being involved,
the matter is one which cannot be
submitted to arbitration.
It is the second time such a pro
posal has been turned down and it
was repected definitely and finally, it
is reliably said, at the last conference
which the secretary of state had with
Ambpssador ]ernstorff.
The first proposition, it is recalled,
was made shortly after the Lusitania
was sunk. At that time it was reject
ed on the ground that the United
States had no assurances that, pend
ing an arbitral decision by The Hague
court, to which Germany proposed to
submit the dispute, Germany would
not continue sinking merchant vessels
without. warning.
Subsequently, however, Germany in
formed the United States she had re
scinded her former orders to subma
rine commanders and that henceforth
the rules of international law, requir
ing due warning and care for the safe
ty of passengers and crews, would be
strictly lived up to.
On the occasion of his last confer
ence with Mr. Lansing and in the light
of the assurances just referred to, it
is said, Count von l3ernstorff renewed
the proposition, the sole question to
be submitted to arbhration being that
relating to disavowal.
Germany, lie said, greatly deplored
the loss of American lives on board
the Lusitania and was willing to dem
onstrate the extent of her regrets by
paying an indemnity. She could not,
the ambassador Insisted, admit that
the attack without warning on the
Lisitania was illegal.
This attack he is said to have in
sided was a reprisal against Great
Britain's illegal blockade. Internation
al law, he argued, recognizes that re
prisals are legal. There is nothing
in international law, the ambassador
contended, which states that reprisals
cannot be undertaken it they endanger
the lives of neutrals. That being the
case, lie said, the assumption was that
neutrals shoiil keep out of harm's
way when plain warning is given that
reprisals are to be resorted to.
Secretary Lansing is reported to
have replied that the right of the
Americans to be on board the Lusi
tania could not be questioned and that
their right to the protection which in
ternational law aciords to neutrals on
the high seas was too firmly estab
1liued to admit. of debate.
