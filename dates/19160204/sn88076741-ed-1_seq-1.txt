PROGRESS OF TKC WAR.
The week has bees uneventful along
*11 fighting lines.
The only place where their appears
much movement is the Caueasius where
they sent the Grand DukeNicholas after
deposing him from the supreme com
mand of the Russian army In Poland
and Galaeia. But what actually oc
«urring these is hard to tell as the re
ports are very contradictory.
A very extensive aeroplane ratid was
made over parts of England at and near
Leverpooi killing about 50 persons and
wounding many more. The raid was
made with the help of a mist
Wednesday's dispatches tell of a re
markable case «n naval circles. An Eng
lish steamer the "Appam" arrived at
Hampton roads in charge of a German
price crew .of 23 and altogether some 400
persons on board. It seems that a G«r
cruiser «f some sort has keen fitted out
somewhere and has sunk six or seven
mere hast vessels near the African coast
and the Canary Islands. She is called
the "Moere" and after taking "Appam"
she loaded the crews and passengers
from the othe ships taken and sunk, into
the "Appam" put a prize crew on board
and sent her to Hampton Roads.
The commander in chaige "Appam'1
claims to have converted the "Appam"
into an armed cruiser while at sea and
sailed into Hampton Roads and there
fore claims the privileges of an armed
cruiser to repair and' refit and then re
turn to sea, qc« if he remains in port
than the ship to be interned for the rest
of the war, which latter of oourse is his
plan.
On the other hand if the "Appam" is
only an ordinary prise then aeoording
to the usual usage, the Germans lose any
control or ownership as soon as she ar
rive in a neutral port, and the ship will
be delivred to the nesrest British oonsul
to be restored to owners.
It will make a rather difficult question
for Washington authorities to unravel
as there is not much diplomatic preced
ent.
As to the general situation, then is

would wish the other to make
the necessary assaults, each being quite
certain that their positions are impreg
nable, and that the offensive troops
would necessarily suffer the most, ss is
nlways .the case when men leave their
own defences to tight in the open sgsinst
an enbr nched foe.
While 'Germany has been far more
successful on the whole than hsve the
entente allies, yet
BO
fsr«Qermsny has
made no definite success as to the final
ending uf war in het favor. 'Germany
occupies a large amount of conquered
territory, but is still confronted by ar
mies at least equal in numbers and
.equipment to her own.
And ^England still contois the sea. It
is a curious speculation if we suppose
that Germany by deftatung.the entente
forces in .France should be able to take
that country hs sbe has Belgium and
4» Serbia hut that. England was still un
touched on land or sea—what would be
4 the linal result.?

"PREP A.RDNESS"—WHAT?
Just ow probably the matter of "pre
pardoess" is toe most popular subject of
discussion .by both papers and peqple.
And perhaps
a more Jndefinite^lidiM*
gue subject never before interested the
people. /-r -v
To discuss .any subject intelligently,
the very first matter should be to.find
.out definitely what one is talking about.
This new word, "prepardness" as so
commonly ueeu has never yet been de
fined in any dictionary. It means all
sorts and conditions to all sorts and con*
ditions of people.
There a few people who,like the Quak
ers, literally believe in no "prepardness"
whatever. They prefer to turn the other
cheek rather than fight. The number
of these is so small that they are practi
cally negligible, and all the more so that
most of these would fight if driven into
a corner.
Eliminating these from consideration^
then we have the rather remarkable fact
that almost every body believes in being
prepared for war. Hence, the present
discussion is just a question of degree, of
how much?
But even in this there is a great con
fusion of ideas. What is a large army?
What is a large navy? What do we
mean when .we say a larger navy, or per
haps specify by saying second to that
of Great Britian"
When we talk to a laiger army, do we
mean a hundred-thousand, a million or
or two million? Shall these be militia
trained citizens or regulars?
Navies are not measured- when the
fighting begins only by the number of
ships nor yet simply by size -and guns.
Do you remember the Russian fleet, in
Japanese war that had the sanguinary
engagement with the English fishing
boats? Germany is credited with a navy
"seoond to that of Great Britian" but
they are not doing much so far in the
present war.
The real fact is that most of us can
have but very indefinite notions about
what we mean by "prepardness." Even
the trained officers of the army and navy
disagree about it. It is like a big busi
ness man in New York attempting to
decide how many cows and horses should
be kept on a Red River valley farm or
the farmer attempting to say how many
motortrucks that merchant should pur
chase to run bis business properly.
But the merchant knows that the far
mer ought to have cows and horses, and
.the farmer thinks the merchant ahould
have the motor trucks, and that is about
as much as most of us know about
the subject of ''prepardness.1'

SMALL TRACTOIIS.

before the Society of American EmIb*!
eers by Mb C. E. Mason is revie
the current Literary Digest. We
that our space fecbids copying in (otyf. xi
The engiieer regard#: the small
tor as the next treat innovation in f*irs|
ing. He cites the feet that in l9i* lhQri'
were made half as many tractors the to»
tal made before that date while i!01$
doubled the output of the previous jMwi
and the manufacturers expect to hihtty
be' able to supply the demand jsftlf,
doubleing the number sold in 1916.
Statistics show that then are more
than two million farms where the trac
tor could be used with benefit. We of
course know that if these maohiaes an
a success then then is no plsce when
they csn be snd will be more successful
than in this valley when the aatura)
obstructions an almost nil.
In the discussion, the engineer elisain
ates the four plow and larger machines
as being too expensive. The cost of
from fifteen hundred to two thousand
dollars make them out of-the race until
the stage of experiment and experience
is over. But the new small tractoroat
from $350 and upward make it possible
for the farmer to buy even atsosie risk
of efficiency.
He also says that at this time there
an more than one hundred and fifty
"two-plow" tractors msde, no two alike
and so different that they are hard to
classify. Very generally however, they
first, the machines evolved from the
ststionery engine. Rather heavy, with
large cylinder capacity and simple in de
sign and construction.
The second general class based on
automobile construction, is lighter, has
smaller and more cylinders and more
complicated ,parts.
The third class is composed of modifi
cations of the-other two.
The object of the manufacturers of
the first class is simpicity for stesdy
work. The auto types are intended for
more mobility and for different.classes
of work.
The engineer "states that more is ex
pected and required of a tractor than al
most^any other machinery. An auto
'mobile is doing Well when it needs ut
special repairs or readjustment of parts
until after running ten thousand miles.
A tractor is expected to run a whole sea
son under a constant heavy strain of
nearly its full power without repairs or
adjustment.
All tractors are as yet experiments!
and it will take time and experience to
develops the perfect types. When the
type is finslly determined then the
prices will be lass because of the manu
facture on a larger scale by larger con*
erns.
