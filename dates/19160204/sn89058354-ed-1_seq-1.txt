AGAIN SHOP EMPLOYES ARE
WORKING NINE HOUR DAY
Will Probably Get Full Six
Days Every Week When
Dull Season Is Over
HAVE BEEN WORKING EIGHT
: HOURS SEVENTEEN MONTHS
Prosperity Returning to Paris
With Longer Hours For
Shop Employes
After working eight hours for
more than seventeen months the
employes of the local Louisville
& Nashville railway shops went
back to the nine hour schedule
Tuesday of this week.
While no official announcement
has been made it is expected
that the shops will be working
six days per week, instead of
five, when the dull months have
passed. January and February
are usually the dullest months of
the year at the shops, it is said.
Employes are jubilant over the
return of prosperity to Paris.
Twenty additional hours monthly
means a great deal to' many of
them. " - '
Shortly after the outbreak of
the European war the time was
eut to five days and eight hours
and sometimes, employes have
been getting only four days per
. week,., -The i posting ; oLgaotices
Saturday announcing that the
nine hour schedule would be
resumed on Tuesday came as a
surprise to many of the
employes.
MEXICAN QUAIL ARE BARRED
Owing to the prevalence of
quail disease among birds import
ed from Mexico at the ports of
New York, and Eagle Pass,
Texas, during the past month,
the department of agriculture
has suspended issue of further
permits for entry of these birds
this season. Quail in shipments
actually en route to the United
States on January 20 will be ad
mitted to quarantine, but no fur
ther entries will be authorized.
Most of the States now have
Buch stringent game laws that it
practically impossible to pur
chase quail even for propagating
purposes in the United States
and dealers have sought quail
elsewhere, especially in north
western Mexico where quail oc
cur in abundance, but Mexican
quail on arrival at destination
are frequently found infected
with quail disease. So fatal is
this disease that when it once
appears most Of the birds which
are exposed to it die within a
few days. In one shipment of
196 quail which recently reached
New York only three birds sur
, vived the voyage, and in another
- of about 160 birds, more than
two-third3 of the number died
shortly after arrival. More than
one-third of all the Mexican quail
imported last year died within a
few months. .

Many Need , School Supplies
Who Are Not Able To:
Purchase Them
There are a large number of
children, of school age, in Paris
whose parents or guardians are
not able to purchase the neces
sary books. The law compels
parents to send their children
to school and many are very
much embarrassed because of
their financial disability to buy
the books and supplies.
In the past some of the teach
ers at the Atkins-Porter and Lee
schools have been furnishing
books, but feel that they can no
longer afford to do this, and it
does no good to send children to
school without books.
It has boen suggested that a

No Action Taken by Commis

Is Expressing Interest
According to the opinion of
several well known attorneys
the Henry county road law was
knocked out and replaced by the
Robertson and Haywood county
statute passed two months after
the enactment of the Henry
county law.
These attorneys declare that
there cannot be the slightest
doubt but that the law last enact
ed repeals the first, and say that
the clause "or by any subsequent
Federal census" clearly makes
the Robertson and Haywood
county act apply to Henry coun
ty. " -. . .
So far as has been learned no
steps have been taken by the
members of the "Highway Com
mission" to test the two acts in
the courts, although the public
continues to take a great deal of
interest in the matter. It is

CUR
PRISONERS;
Jailbirds Could Have Secured
Release Through Writ
of Habeas Corpus
WORKHOUSE COMMISSIONERS
WILL CONTINUE ROAD WORK
Walter F. Brockwell Chosen
Guard For Another Year
By Acclamation
If a contract leasing Henry
county's workhouse prisoners to
some other county had been
made, as the county court au
thorized at its last session, every
one of these jailbirds could have
obtained a writ of habeas corpus
and secured his release. - This
was the opinion given by one of
the ablest lawyers in Paris, it is
understood, and the workhouse
commissioners decided to ' keep
the prisoners at work on the
county roads, even if this plan is
a losing proposition to the J
county. "
, It seems that when a person
is sentenced to the workhouse
in this county he is 'sentenced to
the workhouse of Henry county
and no other, and the Supreme
Court has held that the sentence .
does not mean any workhouse
in any county the authorities
may choose,' but that .the prison
ers must be kept in the county
in which they are convicted.-
It was put up to the Henry
county court that the county
was losing money by keeping
the prisoners, feeding, and in
many instancss clothing them,
and so the court passed a resolu
tion giving the county judge the
authority to lease them to some
other county. There was very
little opposition to the resolution,
but now the whole plan fails be
cause if an attempt should be
made to carry it out the jailbirds
would be free in a few days.
When they found that it was
impossible to lease the prisoners
to some other county, the work
house commissioners immediate
ly reelected Constable Walter F.
Brockwell as workhouse guard.
Mr. Brockwell's-election was by
acclamation, we are informed.
The workhouse commissioners
are H. B. Swinney, W. E. Wel
don, R. H. Compton and W. D.
Morris. With possibly one exf
ception, they -favored the lease
of the prisoners provided the
plan had been legal, it is said.
TRANSPORTATION OF EX-

Wednesday night there will be

Transportation of Explosives and
Other Dangerous Articles" by a
representative of the Bureau of
Explosives of the American Rail
