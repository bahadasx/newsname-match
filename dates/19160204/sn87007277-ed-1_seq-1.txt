BOWL FOR AMUSEMENT
Fight Shy of Sharks Is Advice of
New York Writer.
Ne Other Gsme or Sport That Claim
to Have as Many Participants as
Bowling Tende to Better
Health and Spirits.
W. V. Thompson, writing in the New
York World takes a "crack" at so
called "pot-hunters." He says in part:
"Just as soon as one becomes Inter
ested in bowling and discovers how
easy it is to roll a fair average, he
then wanta to bowl In competition.
Hie one ambition is to beat somebody
and in tournament play, but natural
ly, prefers not to compete with the so
called "stars" or sharks," those who
own or manage bowling alleys and
practice free, especially those that do
nothing else.
"They tell me there are more than
50,000 bowlers in Greater New York
who are Interested principally for the
physical and social benefits, a great
majority of whom are virtually elim
inated from competition bowling, ex
cept in the closed tournaments. There
is no other game or sport that even
claims to have as many participants
as bowling. There is a reason for
this.
"It Is the demand for play, born in
us. that cries out for expression in the
midst of the whirl of business. An
hour at noon, or more at evening after
toll, the fellowship of others bent upon
the same pursuit, and for adults the
right to choose and the responsibility
to use properly, make the whole pro
gram one of delight and profit to all
concerned.
"The flabby muscles that tire so
easily respond to nature's way of keep
ing In shape; the circulation Improves
with exercise, and better health and
better spirit follow.
"Every employer of labor should en
courage his employees to participate
in some game after work. It will be
better If he leads the way. It he la a
large employer o( labor, it may be best
to provide something close to the work
shop, factory, mill, store, or, as some
have already done, put in an equip
ment in the store.
"It pays in better work, co-operation
if you are in the play; it stands be
tween you and trouble, chases the doc
tor out of the house and gives the
country a better type of human beings.
Surely this is a game worth while."

LOSES
IN BATTLE, WHS
FIANCEE ANEW
Canadian, Mind Made Blank by
Shell Concussion, Does Not
Know Parents.
IS STRANGER THAN FICTION
Thomas Truster Sent Baok to Front
Prom Hospital, Palls to Recall His
Name and la Reported Missing
Forgets Sweetheart and
Falls In Love With Her
"All Over Again."
New York. Fate has played many
strange pranks with the men fighting
In Europe, but none perhaps is more
curious than that in which Thomas F.
Trusler figures. Mr. Truster, who is
stopping at a hotel, was a gunner in
the Third brigade, Canadian field ar
tillery. The concussion from a shell which
struck the ground near him last win
ter caused him to lose all recollection
of the past. Consequently, his fiancee
In Montreal mourned him for dead,
and even after he learned his identity
through a scar on his right foot be did
not remember her or his parents.
However, as he explained recently,
he took his parents' word that they
were his father and mother, and, al
though he does not recall his first pro
posal, he said he has fallen In love
all over again with the woman he was
to have married and soon he hopes to
make her bis bride.
Although Sir Frederick Treves, King
George's surgeon, is said to have at
tempted to restore his memory by
means of hypnotism, Mr. Trusler, who
is twenty-one years old, recalls noth
ing of his past prior to the day his
mind became blank from the concus
sion, and when he returned to Canada
In the early autumn because of his
wound it was necessary for him to
relearn the way about his native city
of Montreal and to be introduced to
lifelong boyhood friends and school
mates. Under Fire at Ypres.
The young gunner went with the
first Canadian contingent which
reached France a year ago. At that
time the German general staff was per
fecting its schemes to break through
to Calais by way of Ypres. Mr. Trus
ler first came under fire near Vlamar
tlnghe, just west of Ypres. His divi
sion was acting as a reserve force.
"I have been told by men who
served with me on my gun that we
all saw a huge German aeroplane fly
over us," Mr. Trusler said. "Soon
thereafter there came a rain of high
explosive shells from a big German
gun. Several of our boys were killed,
and the fact that I was not was a
miracle. One of the shells fell within
ten or twenty feet of me, I was told,
but did not explode. The concussion,
however, was terrific, and It dazed and
stnpefled me.
"1 remember awakening in a base
hospital with the wounded all about
me. I felt myself all over and could
find nothing smashed, so I sat up in
my cot. Then I got out of it and stood
up and asked why I was there. A
physician told mo what had happened
to me and sent me back to my brigade,
which he located by the Insignia on
my uniform. When I got back I didn't
seem to recollect anything or any
body. "Some of the men of my gun com
pany saw me and took me back to my
quarters. If was necessary for me to
make friends with companions again.
VICTIM OF AUTO DISEASE
Petromortls, or Automobile Gas Pois
oning, Kills a Chicago
Lawyer.
Chicago. Eugene M. Bumphrey, a
lawyer, is dead at his home here of
what physicians term petromortls, or
automobile gas poisoning. According
to physicians, it is the first fatal case
in Chicago from that cause.
An idea of the violence with which
petromortls attacks Its victims was
given by Dr. John D. Ellis, head of the
department of occupational diseases
of Rush Medical college.
"The thing Is new to science in
some aspects," said Doctor Ellis. "Per
sons who are subject to vertigo may
be attacked when in a close, small
garage. The danger lies in a failure
of certain elements In the gasoline to
oxidise. In any event, there Is a
quick suffusion of a violent gas that
renders the victim taint Thus It the
exhaust of an automobile continues,
the result Is almost Instant death.
"The post-mortem shbwlngs are
those of brain and lung congestion,"
They called me 'Howie'- a nickname
and soon I became known as 'Howie
Truster.' That fact made it difficult
for my parents to locate me, because
when I was aeked my name I spelled
It 'Tressler,' because I didn't want
anybody to know that I couldn't recall
where I came from or who I was.
Is Reported Missing.
"Consequently 'T. F. Trusler went
on the rolls ot the missing. Conse
quently also, I failed to get mall from
my fiancee and my parents. It was
not until last summer when I was
wounded In the leg so badly that I was
sent to England that I made any at
tempt to find out who I was. I con
fided my story to an Englishwoman
of high rank who was Interested In
the hospital. She made Inquiries
among the officers of my brigade who
remembered 'Trusler who came out
with the contingent.
"My parents were communicated
with and my mother remembered an
old scar on my toot Sure enough
the sear was there. Even when 1
returned to Montreal I didn't recog
nise my mother and don't yet 1
learned I was engaged to be married
before I left for the front and on my
return home my fiancee was at the
station with my mother and father.
I didn't recognise any ot them, but
they took me home."
Here Mr. Trusler admitted that be
had fallen in love "all over again" and
with the same girl.
Although the gunner cannot remem
ber what happened before January ot
last year, he has a vivid recollection
of what has happened since, and his
description ot the battle ot Ypres In
April and of the effect of the poison
gases used by the Germans Is most
vivid.
"About five o'clock of the evening
of April 23," he said, "we were get
ting quite bored, for we were in the
reserve force along the Poperinghe
road, three miles west of Ypres. The
dull monotony was rudely broken by
the sudden appearance of swarms ot
French colonial troops, Singhalese and
Zouaves, rushing in from the front
trenches, clutching at their throats,
holding their sides, rolling on the
ground, gasping tor breath, eyes blood
shot and staring, many of them bleed
ing at the mouth, but most ot them
unable to explain the cause ot their
peculiar actions.
Asphyxiating Gas Cloud
"Along with them came scores of
refugees, men, women and children,
bearing with them all they could take
from their burning and wrecked
homes. At that time we had never
heard of asphyxiating gas and were at
a loss to make out what it all meant
The order stand to your arms was
quickly passed along to the reserves.
The Montreal Highlanders were the
first to get on the move. It takes
longer to get artillery wagons on the
move, and while we were working at
feverish haste the Highlanders went
by, each man singing and smiling,
although they must have known that
many of them would never return.
"At seven o'clock the artillery
forces were all ready and waiting
for the order to move forward. I shall
never forget the scene at the moment
From the city of Ypres there arose
high In the heavens huge jets ot
flames, while overhead shells burst
by the hundreds, and In our ears was
the din of falling walls and all sorts
of Indescribable noises.
"When the order came to move for
ward we urged our horses with a
cheer and a song. It was necessary
for us to make a detour south ot Ypres
in order to get to the main road lead
ing to our damaged front It also
was necessary to cross the Yser canal,
about half a mile south of the town,
on a pontoon bridge. The first gun
got over safely, when along came a
German shell and destroyed it
"Under a deadly fire, tor the Ger
mans had the range, we waited while
the engineers worked to construct an
other bridge. Two long thick poles
were placed across the narrow canal
and crossways on them timbers and
logs were piled. The second gun
went across precariously, but the
Bumphrey went to his garage last
night to get his automobile. In which
he Intended to deliver a number of
Christmas gifts to poor families. An
hour later his body was found on the
floor ot the garage, the engine of the
automobile was running, and the
small room was filled with gas fumes.
Our Nature Note.
Madlsonvllle, Ky. J. if. Fugate,
well-known farmer ot the. Moss Hill
neighborhood, was a caller at the
Hustler office last Saturday and in
showing us some apples he had with

third was upset by a rolling log, the
cannon carriage falling on one side of
the narrow bridge and the six horses
on the other. While the cannon and
horses seemed to be seesawing this
way and that across the bridge a shell

ed, and my gun went across. By this
time the glare from the burned town
was dying down, and I was wondering
just what was ahead ot us when an
aeroplane high above dropped a star
shell. This was followed by a perfect
hurricane of shells, and the last gun
to attempt the crossing went into the
water. Emerging from a wood, we
ran into a murderous gunfire from
German Infantry and machine guns.
My gun and others of our battery
were hurled into this open fire-swept
field, swung around and in less than
two minutes opened fire on the Ger-

but the German infantry remained hid
den behind a deep fringe ot trees
with their own dead piled up against
them. Our guns could not do effective
work because of the trees. Therefore
we were ordered to use high explosive
shells.
"I shall never forget how those)
shells were brought to us. The horses
on the ammunition supply wagon be
came crazed and ran away. They
dashed within a few yards ot the Ger
man lines, and one brave rider no
one ever knew who he was shot the
first two horses dead. The wagon
rolled over them and him. Then
there was an explosion, for the wagon,
hit by a shell, was blown to bits. The
explosion wrought havoc among the
Germans and our infantry, quickly fol
lowing up the advantage, drove the
Teutons out of the woods.
"Meantime our line was badly
pressed near St Julien, and after the
arrival ot fresh British and Canadians
our battery was ordered there. We
went right into the town. But on and
on came the German infantry, and th
retreat was sounded.
Spying Is Dangerous.
"Spying at the front is the most
dangerous of all occupations," Mr.
Trusler continued.
"The Germans are very clever at it,
and one method of sending news be
tween the lines is by trained dogs.;
One night one of our sentries saw s
dog dart past him. He called to the
animal, thinking the dog would make
an excellent mascot for the battery.
The dog came back and wagged his
tall and the sentry took htm to his
quarters.
"The following morning one of the
men remarked on the thickness ot the
plain leather collar worn by the dog.
An examination revealed that the col
lar was hollow, and in it we found a
message In cipher. Instantly an offi
cer was summoned, the dog was put
on a long wire leash and driven out ot
camp. He went direct to a barber
shop, where the men were in the habit
of lounging and talking when off duty.
The barber, whom we thought to be a
Belgian, was a German spy and after
ward was put to death.'
