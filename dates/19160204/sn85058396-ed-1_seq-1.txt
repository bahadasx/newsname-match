M Washington, Feb. 4. Late today
tU f Count von Bemstorff, the German am-
!tH X bassador, received his government's
H r answer in the Lusitania negotiations
rJ ' and tok ' to a conference with Sec
M retary Lansing. The ambassador
'J' sa'd before conferring with the sccre
a t ta,,y tnat ne did not understand how
"1; the Instructions he had could be un
9 ;; satisfactory to the United States.
il: The German ambassador conferred
. with Secretary Lansing less than five
M , minutes and left the state, war and
yM , navy building flanked by clerks to
ward off questioners.
Secretary Lansing replied to ques-
tioners:
''There is absolutely nothing to be
said. The matter is confidential."
Count von Bemstorff finally made
the same reply when inquirers inter
rupted him.
Finally, in response to repeated re
quests for a statement, Secretary
! (Lansing sent out from his office the
message:
"The situation is unchanged."
Berlin, Feb. 4, via London, 12:20
p. m. Information reaching The Asso
'ciated Press today indicates that un
der no circumstances will Germany
admit that the sinking of the Lusi
: tan is was an illegal act.
The new instructions forwarded to
! Ambassador von Bemstorff, accord
ing to this information, contains sim
ply one phrase of the new formula
4 tion of the proposed note of regret
I for the sinking of the Lusitania. The
suggested sentence is short consist
Y lrg of -onlyclght words, and 'ddes-nof
I contain the word "illegal." It repre-
sents the extreme limit of Germany's
J concessions In the Lusitania case.
Berlin, Feb 4, via London The
Kreuz Zeitung interprets "President
' ' "Wilson's present warlike course" as
dictated to some extent by political
considerations. It says both the
! American and European press have
I regarded the president's attitude
throughout the war as being influenc-
I ed by the approaching campaign, but
H 'no one considered such an interprcta-
- tlon of his utterances as especially
.unfriendly to him, regarding it as a
III thing to be expected.
lit Assuming a more serious tone, the
III I Kreuz Zeitung adds:
Iff "At the moment it seems best to

III I German people are most completely
III j agreed; namely that nobody, of
l) (course, will regard a conflict with the

Iff that we are already resolved, never-

H nity, without laying upon ourselves
H betters that hinder our freedom of
Hit i mnvnmont In thp Rtnirrlr fnr nur CX-

H Latest Instructions Very Reserved.
H The Vosslsche Zeitung and the
H Tageblatt both hold that the an-
H ; nouncement in regard to the latest
H ' Instructions sent to Ambassador von
H ' Bemstorff are not so sweeping as
H generally supposed.
H , The Tageblatt says the language
H ; used was very reserved and could not
warrant any hasty or far reaching
H' conclusion.
Hi; Facing Grave Situation.
H George Bernhard, editor of the Vos-
H sische Zeitung draws the conclusion
mil that the Lusitania negotiations havo
I reached a point where German states
men are called upon to make decisions
of the utmost gravity. Germany's
agreement to pay Indemnity "for the
loss of American Jives and to submit
to the tribunal at Tho Hague the
H. question whether the torpedoing of
IK the Lusitania was in accordance with
1 international law, be says does not
appear to have satisfied the American
government which insists that Ger

This -would deprive submarine war

Iti Is not the case, tvc can, nevertheless,
IL expect with certainty that no decision
m will be taken calculated to cast doubt
upon the dignity of the German peo
ple or to interfere with their vital
necessities."
Serious Crisis of War.
The view is entertained here that
one of the most serious crisis of the
war has arisen in connection with the
Lusitania case and that it is impos
sible to foresee the outcome from any
Indications here The result of the
negotiations appears to hinge solely
on the word "illegal."
In the way of an agreement be
tween the United States and Germany
stand only these seven letters expres
sing the conception which President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing insist
must be embodied in the German for
mula expressing regret for the loss of
American lives aboard the Canarder.
Germany Will Not Give In.
The Associated Press Is informed
positively and authoritatively that
Germany cannot and will not desig
nate as illegal the sinking of a liner
by any submarine.
Virtually no other difficulties in the
way of settlement remain and the
new instructions forwarded to Ambas
sador von Bemstorff on Tuesday con
tain merely the new formula by which
it is hoped to satisfy Washington
without humiliating this country. Al
though the suggested sentence, accord
ing to a reliable version, consisLs of
only eight words and does not con
tain the word "Illegal" or character
ize the sinking of the Lusitania as
such, it goes to. otherwise, the furth
est extent possible toward meeting
American esires.
Germany Has Reached Limit.
Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, under-secre-tfiry
for foreign affairs, in an inter
iew with the Associated Press, ex
pressed the hope that the new formu
la forwarded to Ambassador von
Bemstorff would offer a possible bas
is of settlement. However, he made
no effort to conceal the gravity of
the situation and was mOBt explicit
in his statements that Germany had
reached the extreme limit of conces
sions and under no circumstances
would concede the illegality of her
submarine campaign in the war area,
"The government Is willing to do
everything In its power, and has done
everything In its power, to meet
American wishes," he said, "but there
are limits beyond which even friend
ship snaps.
"I do not understand America's
course. We have thought the subma
rine issue and the Lusitania question
on the way to arrangement had
agreed to pay indemnity and all that
when the United States suddenly
made its new demands, which it is
impossible for us to accept.
"You must not push your demands
too far. You must not attempt to hu
miliate Germany."
Lansing Note Raises Trouble.
Dr. Zlmmermann left no doubt that
the whole crisis centered on Secre
tary Lansing's demand that Germany
dlsavow the sinking of the Lusitania
as an act contrary to international
law.
The under-secretary declared re
peatedly that America could not pos
sibly admit this procedure was il
legal Breach Must Come.
He asserted again and again, that,
if the United States desired to' drive
matters to a breach, Germany could
go no further to avoid it, and that
the breach, with all its lamentable
consequences, must come.
The most regretable phase of the
situation, he asserted, was that there
existed no really important reasons
for a breach, no conflicts of inter
ests between Germany and the United
States. Germany, ho said, was count
ing on reciprocal development of
trado with America after the war.
These hopes would bo dashed, or at
any rate their development would be
hampered greatly, if a breach were
to come now.
German-American tension was again
reflected on the bourse, prices declin
ing moderately In general, but war
stocks more sharply. The afternoon
newspapers for thfe most part abstain
from discussion of the case.
Situation Seems Serious.
Washington, Feb. 4. In the absence
of official information, Secretary Lan
sing today refused to discuss any
phase whatever of the Lusitania ne
gotiations. While it appeared at the
state department that tho situation
was regarded as seriously as it is
reflected in Berlin dispatches, it was
not permitted to appear on the sur
face. President Wilson read the Berlin
dispatches on the situation while his
train was running between Baltimore
(c Washington. He made no com
ment, but nlembers of his party said
they regarded the situation as "un
favorable." It was said that the
president had not finished consider
ing the official dispatches he received
last night on his train.
Count von Bemstorff declined to
discuss tho Berlin dispatches because
he has not received his government's
answer "which was supposed to have
started from the Berlin office on
February 1.
Wihen Count von Bemstorff re
cently transmitted the last draft of
the agreement to Berlin, 'after hav
ing submitted it to Secretary Lansing,
the ambassador believed it would be
acceptable to his government.

APPAM STATUS
IS NOT DECIDED
Situation Growing Out of
Case May Affect Fundamen
tal Questions of Naval
Warfare.
Newport News, Va., Feb. 4. Only
Lieutenant Berg and his small prize
crew remained today aboard the form
er British passenger steamer Appam,
brought into these neutral waters last
Tuesday as a prize of war. The lin
er's passengers and original ship's
company, taken prisoners when the
steamer was captured by a mysterious
German raider off the Canary Islands
January 15 were liberated last night
by order of the United States gov
ernment. The passengers today were aboard
the Old Dominion liner Jefferson en
route for New York where they were
expected to arrive early tonight The
members of the crew, with the gun
pointers taken from other British
steamers which the raider sank be
fore the Appam was overhauled, were
in Norfolk awaiting the sailing of an
other New York steamer tonlghL
The Appam is to remain at this port
until the Washington government de
cides what disposition of her shall he
made whether she shall be held a
fair prize of her German captors un
der the Prussian-American treaty or
be returned to her British owners un
der The Hague convention.
GREAT BRITAIN
CLAIMS APPAM
Formal Demand Made to
United States for Return of
Liner to British Govern
ment. Washington, Feb. 4. Conferences
over the Status of the British liner
were continued today between Secre
tary Lansing and other officials of
the slate department and the neutral
ity board. Final decision probably
will not be reported before tomorrow.
Delay in reaching a decision as to
whether the ship should be returned
to her British owners 'under The
Plague convention or hold as a prize
of war under the Prussian-American
treaty is due to the possibility that
the situation growing out of the case
might threaten to affect some of the
fundamental questions of naval war
fare In dispute between tho United
States and Germany.
Treaty Governs Case.
Secretary Lansing indicated today
hat the United States had decided to
hold that the Prussian-American trea
ty governs the case of tho Appam, as
Germany contends, and all that re
mained to be decided was the inter
pretation of the application of the
treaty's terms.
The secretary disclosed further that
the sole question to be decided by the
Interpretation was how long tho Ap
pam should be permitted to remain
in American waters. The treaty guar
antees to a German prize the right to
come and go freely. If forced to de
part German officials have stated the
Appam would be sunk to prevent her
capture by the British.
Germany is expected to contend
that tho treaty guarantees the Appam
the right to remain safe in Hampton
Roads until the case goes before a
prize court for adjudication. Tech
nically, the ship does not become
Germany's prize until such a court es
tablishes the validity of her capture.
Berg Surrenders Mall.
Newport News, Va., Feb, 4. Lieu
tenant Berg will surrender tho first
class mail on the Appam, but will
hold the parcel post pending further
consideration. The commander agreed
to deliver unopened to the postoffice
authorities here 153 sacks of first
class mail to be sent to its destination.
There are 150 sacks of parcel posL
Collector Hamilton, asked as to
whether the prize crew would be per
mitted to keep the bombs on the Ap
pam, replied that tho Washington au
thorities would have to decide.
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British
ambassador, today presented a form
al demand on behalf of his govern
ment for the return to British owners
of the liner Appam, taken by a Ger
man prize crew. A new diplomatic
controversy with Great Britain is fore
shadowed as the United States prac
tically has decided to hold the prize

Maria Leinois of Irving Park, Chi
cago, one of the Red Cross nurses who
survived. She said:
"The steamship, with her decks cov
ered with dead, sank with hideous
rapidity I was shot into the water
which was full of struggling youths
trying to keep afloat but disappearing
one by one within sight of land.
"We struck a mine at 9:30 o'clock
in the morning and the ship began to
sink Immediately We tried to lower
a boat, but tho ship heeled over so
that everybody In the boat was thrown
into the water. Miss Hample, my
companion, could not swim and never
came up I managed to scramble
back aboard the Brindisi where I
found some 200 Montenegrins who
were unable to swim.
Men Cheat the Foe.
"These men said they would not
die by the enemy's hand. They sang
their national anthem and then one
squad shot the others and finally
killpd themselves. Tho decks were
covered with dead and were awash
with blood When tho ship began to
founder, I slipped back into the water
and swam to a plank on which several
men were clinging but who dropped
off one by one. Finally, after being
three hours in the water, I was picked
up and taken to San Giovanni di Me
dua "As soon as the 143 persons rescued
were safely ashore, the Montenegrins
lined up and re-sang the national an
them. While the men were singing
an Austrian aeroplane squadron bom
barded the town, killing eighteen of
those who had just been saved.
"From San Giovanni di Medua we
walked to Scutari and sought to join
the Serbian staff at Plavinca, but six
days later the evacuation of the town
took place.
Guests or King.
"King Nicholas of Montenegro
fetched us to Scutari in his boat. He
is a kindly and democratic old man
who seems to understand.
"From Scutari we walked 'five days
through sleet and snow over detest
able roads, along which the hunger
weakened Serbians died one after an
other. "Reaching Durazzo, seven pursuing
Austrian aeroplanes bombarded the
town where the remnants of the Serbi
an army were so crowded that they
were unable to escape the missiles.
Many were killed and others wounded.
"From Durazzo we accompanied the
Serbs to Avlona and Corfu and thence
to Athena."

London, Feb. 4, 10:55 a. m. A dis
patch to the Star from Rotterdam car
ries the story of a member of tho
crew of the Dutch tank steamer Arte
mis which was torpedoed in tho North
sea and arrived yesterday at the Hook
of Holland In a leaking condition.
The tanker. In ballast, sailed from
the Hook of Holland for England at
midnight, Tuesday, carrying the dis- H
tmgulshing lights to proclaim her a H
neutral. After scarcely an hour H
steaming, according to the seaman's H
account, she was stopped by two Ger- IH

the torpedo boats steaming along H
with her to see that their orders were H
obeyed. H
About two hours later a third, tor- H
pedc boat appeared from which, ac- H
