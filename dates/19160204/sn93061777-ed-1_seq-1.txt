Hurrah for Clovis! Victory for Homes, Schools,
Churches and Better Citizenship at the Ballot
Box Monday. Clovis
the Loss of the Saloons will Bankrupt Us.
AS THE VOTE STOOD
Ward one. 128 for prohibition,
and 42 against, 3 mutilated. Dry
majority 87.

Dry majority 31.
Ward three. 103 for and

62
against. Wet majority 7.
Clovis joined the list of dry
towns Monday, when out of a
total of six hundred and thirteen
votes, prohibition carried by a
majority of G4.
The conclusion of the count
wus a sigral for giettt rejoicing
among the prohibition forces,
many of whom became fran'ic
with joy. A Urge crowd gather
ed in front of tho post office,
where the demonstration con
tinued fr an hour. The occa
sion was celebrated with a jubi
lee meeting at the Chaistian
Church.
The prediction that the final
iiu come w ould be close has been
frequently made but even the
most optimistic pros never an
ticipated such a complete vic
tory. So cerUin were the "wets" of
winning that they did not get
out all of the votes known to
be favorable to their cause.
They edfered bets at odds just
before the polls closed, but bo
uncertain was the result that
these were not called.
The success of the pros is at
tributed largely to the untiring
aid and faithful support of the
ladies of Clovis, who turned out
n masse and worked like bea
vers from beginning to end.
The workers of both sides and
the people generally show signs
j relief that the five weeks
fight has finally terminated.
THE i'ARADE
The lust great drive of the
prohibition forces began Satur
day afternoon, when in a mist
ing rain, a parade extending
from t he Court house to the dep
ot marched through Main street
headed by Johnson's Chamber of
O-iii.Tu rce Band. In this parade
were many women and children
inautos, wagons and cu ts which
were profusely decorated with
bunting and Hags. They carried
burners containing such inscrip
tions as "Vote It Dry," "Think
if Mother." "Eight Hundred
Humes va F. v Saloons," "I
can't vote, neither can Ma, If
Clovis goes wf:i. Name iton IV
Klc. 'I wo v. fiHf Ih-ats, contain
ing younir gins dressed in white
arid tfmwn by white horses with
white harness, auiacted con
siderable atu-ntion.
The coiiiiir feature of the pa
rade was an old cart containing
a liberal supply of junk and
drawn by a iurro. It was label
ed "Hound fur Texico."
The girls band fared worse
than the others. They had just
taken their places in a large van,
when the muls-a which were
unaccustomed to such a gorgeous
display of colors, bright instru
ments and giddy girls, made a
dash for liberty which they suc
ceeded in gaining after losing
their load. Luckily all jumped
nd were uninjured.
People Do Not Fear that
STREET MEETINGS
While the Prohibitionists were
holding a meeting on one corner
of Main street, the antis held a
meeting on the opposite corner
and on Sunday night preceeding
the election, the pros lectured to
a crowded house at the Elks'
Auditorium and the others held
forth at the Lyceum where all
the available space was occupied.
Attorney J. E. Pardue of Fort
Sumner and Rev. B. B. Crimm
were the principal speakers at
the pro meeting while Attorney
Stanley J. Clark lectured on the
"Man of Gallilee."
The Ladies W. C. T. U. and
others served free lunch to the
voters all day Monday at places
located near the polls.
lhe resuit of the ballot was
known within 30 mimiiei after
the polls closed.
Since the lead of the pros is so
large there is practically no
thought of a content and the
antis seem resigned to their face.
Just when the saloons will be
closed is discretionary with the
City Council after the publica
tion of the ordinance closing the
saloons, but the supposition is
that the members of this body
will be fair end allow the sa
loons a limited time within
which to dispose of their stocks
of liquors.
Hurt in Auto Accident
Virgil McCaskell, state agent
for the Davis Sewing Machine
Company was seriously injured

trol of the cir. A young man

directly in front of the car is
the driver attempted to turn
around him. The front wheel
of the Ford passed over his leg
but aside from a few bruises and
a sore limb, he is uninjured.

To the Petple of Curry County:
I Hm sure every person in the county will be greatly inter
ested in the above figures winch show the percentage and number
of illiterates in New Mexico, by counties and the ranking, as
shown by the government statistics of 1910. Illiteracy as used
here by the government, means persons ten years of age and
over, unable to read and write in some language,
Certainly it must be with a feeling of pride for you to see
your county at the top of the list in a line-up of this nature
However, we must not content ourselves with this report but let
us join the great campaign that is being waged in this state
against illiteracy so that when the government census is taken
tour years from now it may be sh wn that there is not one person
in Curry County, New Mexico, that cannot read and write.
While the report shown that we had 1.3 uer cent. orl'6
persons out of a total of 11.413 in the county in 1910, who could
not read and write, it is my opinion that at this time there are
surely not more than two dozen, if that many. If it happens to
be your neighbor who is unfortunately deprived of such a privi
lege, possibly you can tactfully assist him or her in learning to
read and write.
Very truly yours,
L. C. Mersfeider, Ex-County Superintendent.

Election To Be Contested
The News learns today that
the election is to be contested
but the grounds of complaint
have not as yet be.-n made pub
lic. The supposition is however,
that it will be based upon the
petition circulated which ic ii
ailegod is construed to be a
threat in violation of the cr
nipt practices act. ih s, ho.'
lever, is only a hearsay report
and it may be that the corit...-!!
will be based 'upon entirely dif
ferent grounds. The fc?lin;p
among tho aldermen is to give
the saloons 30 days in which to
close. When the attempt to
close the saloons is made after
the expiration of this time, it is
expected that they will get out
a restraining order and in such
an event, the city couucil will
ask for an injunction closing the
saloons until the matter is
thrashed one in the courts. Lat
er developments ' promise some
thing interesting and sensational.
The Splendid, New, Big
On the Corner of Mitchell Street and Washing
ton Avenue to be Formally Dedicated Sunday,
February 6th.
A Bold Hold Up
The first hold up reported in
Clovis occurred Sunday night
when an immigrant was held up
by two highwaymen at a point
near the stock yards and reliev
ed of his pocket change amount
ing to about four dollars. He
was en route from Memphis to
Fort Sumner and had been up
town attending the prohibition
speaking and was returing to
his immigrant car near the
yards, when he was suddenly
confronted by two men, one of
which shoved a pistol in his face
while the other went through his
pockets, Luckily he carried his
money in his sock which was not
examined by the robbers. It
was dark and he was unable to
give a good description of the
men, hut says that they were
rather tall and slender and ap
peared to wear overalls, jumpers
and caps. The officers have no
clue. The supposition is that
they are the same pair that held
up a grocery store in Amarilio
the day before.
Jail Delivery Monday
Taking advantage of the ex
citement due to the prohibition
election returns Monday evening
and the absence of the jailer,
three prisoners escaped from the
county jail and have not yet
been apprehended. They are
Homer Moulton, charged with
bigamy, J. II Johnsey, charged
with forgery and a negro, Henry
Smith, charged with theft of
liquor. The jail has been under
going some cleaning and repair
ing and the negro was employed
upstairs in the work. The jail
er had two keys to the big cell
where the prisoners were con
fined, one of which he kept
hidden in the upper story, where
the negro had been working and
the supposition is that he found
this and at the opportune time
unlocked the door and liberated
the other prisoners. This belief
is strengthened by the fact that
the key is missing. Johnny who
had almost served out his term,
would have been liberated at the
coming term of district court
within a few days. The negro
had for some time been employ
ed as porter in the Union bar
and was thought to have com
mitted the robbery there several
months ago.
F. A. Wilmeth Dead
F. A. Wilmeth, who recently
came to Clovis from Oklahoma
City and entered into a law
Dartnershio with Stanley .1.
Clark, died on the train while
en routi? back to Oklahoma last
week. He came here for the
benefit of his health and finding
the altitude too high had decided
to return. The end came sud
deal and unexpectedly.
State Corporation Commission
er, O. L. Owen and Mrs. Owen
were here from Santa Fe several
days the first of the week. A
meeting of the state corporation
scheduled here on the 2nd and
he came here to attend that
meeting and incidentally to vote
in the election held Monday, as
he still claims Clovis as his home.
