25,000 MEN NEEDED TO
PROTECT PANAMA CANAL.
Ger., C R. Edwards So Informs the
. Senate Military Committee.
Washington, .Feb. . J.-Ttsrentyyflve
thousand men, or more than one
fourth the present total strength ot
the standing army are needed to in
sure adequate protection of the Pan
ama canal. Brigadier General Clarence
R. Edwards, commanding the canal
garrison, told the senate military com
mittee today in outlining his opinions
on" national defense.
Fixed fortifications, no matter how
strong, cannot guard the zone. General
Kdwards said, and without a mobile
army to back them up the guns al
ready there are a source of weakness,
not strength. He declared the Jungle
on parts of the zone would be more
of a protection than a hindrance to
an approaching enemy.
"But this is far from all," he dded.
"At a distance of from 17 to 20 miles
from the axis of the canal on the Pa
cific side the country is not only free
from jungle and the ordinary . tropical
growths, but it Is as open as are
ports of New Mexico and Lower Cali
fornia. There an enemy is offered
every facility for landing mobile
troops and reaching by easy marches
the vitals of the canal the Miraflores
and Pedro Miguel locks. The most
casual reflection by any military stu
dent familiar ' with the facts should
show that we must never let an enemy
approach within ten miles of the locks.
"The contemplated permanent force
of civil employes Is from 2,000 to !,
500 "whites and 1,000 blacks. In the
event of war likely to Involve -the
canal, it is probable that many of
them would volunteer. I recommend
legislation therefore, that shall re
quire, all male civilian employes of
the canal of suitable age and physical
(condition to obligate themselves to
volunteer and in preparation for this
to offer themselves for a period of at
least two months training during the
first two years of their employment
and thereafter for ten days each year."

MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE
OF BATTLE SIGNAL BOOK.
From the Destroyer Hull of the Pa
'. . cifie Fleet.
frankly admit that they are alarmed
at the mysterious disappearance of the
battle signal book from the destroy
er Hull of the Pacific fleet. r
Admiral Winslow today reported
that all efforts to find the highly con
fidential code have been unavailing
and navy ofilcers said that It proba
bly would at once be replaced by an
other to make useless the one which
has disappeared and which they ad
mit they fear may fall into the hands
or some foreign government.
The battle signal book contains the
secret code used in war and in battle
practice in times of peace. The copy
on the Hull was in possession of
Lieut. H. A. Jones, commander of
the Pacific reserve torpedo flotilla and
Ensign Robert D. Kirkpatrick. Both
officers have been courtmartialed at
Mare Island Navy yard.
Navy officers express some satis
faction that the battle signal book and
not the secret code which is used when
ships are in foreiga waters are com
munlcating with home, is the one
which disappeared. This' latter code
is recognized among nations as the
best of its kind in the world and
wouia ne difficult to replace.

BOMB EXPLODED IN
CANADIAN HOUSE
OF PARLIAMENT
Hist or lo Building Destroyed by Fire-
Two Women Were Overcome By
Smoke and Perished Several Po
licemen and Firemen Were Buried
When One End of the Structure Col
lapsed. Ottawa, Feb. 4. The historic Can
adian parliament building was des
troyed last night by a fire declared un
officially to have been caused by the
explosion of a gas bomb or an in
fernal machine. Two women guests
of the wife of Speaker Sevigny were
overcome by smoke and perished.
. Policemen and Firemen Buried.
Several policemen and firemen were
buried under debris when one end of
the building collapsed. The number
of persons taken to hospitals had not
been determined early this morning.
Frederick F. Pardee, chief liberal whip
and William S. Loggle, a member of
parliament from New Brunswick, are
missing and it is feared they have lost
their lives.
At Least One Explosion.
It has been established that the first
burst of flame in the reading room of
the house of commons was preceded
by at least one explosion and probably
by two. The force of the concus
sion was so severe that person
standing some distance away were
hurled to the floor. A rigid investi
gation to; determine the cause of the
fire already has been undertaken by
the Dominion authorities.
Flames Spread Rapidly.
The flames spread with such amaz
ing rapidity that the Ottawa fire brig
ade was utterly helpless to cope with
them and aid was sent from Montreal
on a special train but at one o'clock
this morning the fire was still raging.
The loss cannot be estimated in
money. The building was valued at
about $5,000,000 but the contents are
of inestimable value. There was no
Insurance.
Chambers Destroyed.
At midnight the commons and sen
ate chambers had been destroyed and
as the great clock boomed out 'the
hour flames were swirling tip the mag
nificent tower and licking their way
to its top. The parliament library
at the rear probably will be saved. Sol
diers were assigned to carry out its
contents.
Members of the parliament, spec
tators in the gallery floor of the house,
government employes and others who
were in the building narrowly escap
ed aeain or injury. .
Flames Barred Progress
Within a few minutes after the fire
begun corridors were . filled with
smoke and at many points the flames
barred progress. There were many
doors to the great building, but since
the outbreak, of the war all except the
main portals nave been' closed to safe
guard the legislators. This precau
tion made escape more difficult and
probably was responsible for the
deaths or Madame Bray of Montreal
anr Mme. Morin of Beauce in one of
the rooms of the speaker's suite.
Dropped Into Net.
Mme. Sevigny saved her two chil
dren by dropping them into a safety
net ana men leaped to sarety herself.
Another of her guests. Mme. Dus-
sauit, saved herself in the same way.
Among those severely burned was
Minister of Agriculture Burrell, who
fell unconscious after plunging
through fire and groping along a
smoke-filled corridor.
APPAM CASE BECOMING
A COMPLEX PROBLEM
Affecting Fundamental Questions of
Naval Warfare.
Washington, Feb. 3. The Appam
case broadened out today, becoming a
complex and possibly far-reaching sit
uation, threatening to affect some of
the fundamental questions of naval
warfare at issue between the United
States and Germany.
For that reason it was not finally
decided whether the ship should be
returned to her British owners under
The Hague convention or held the fair
prize of her German captors under the
Prussian-American treaty, although
the Indications remained that the lat
ter course ultimately would be fol
lowed. Officials are said to realize that their
construction of the Prussian -American
treaty in this case undoubtedly will
come up as a precedent at some other
time during the war, and even might
have a bearing on the case of the
American, sailing ship William P. Frye,
sunk a year ago by the German com
merce raider Prinz FJitel Friedrich. The
Frye case is on the eve of settlement,
virtually on terms for which the
United States contends.

PRfclDENT WILSON TELLS BIG
AUDIENCE IN ST. L0UI8
REFRESHED BY THE TRIP
Is On His Way to Washington, Confi
dent That His Mission for Prepared
ness Has Been Successful May
Make Other Trips.
On Board President Wilson's Special.
Indianapolis. Ind.. Feb. 8. President
Wilson was speeding back to Wash
ington tonight convinced that the peo
ple of the middle west are with him
on the issue of national defense and
are prepared to Insist that congress
taxe speedy action.
He finished his speaking tour in St
Louis and expressed the conviction that
his mission bad succeeded beyond his
greatest hopes. He will arrive in
Washington at 1 p. m. tomorrow.
When 'the president's train reached
Indianapolis at 5.45 p. m. for a five
minute stop, a large crowd greeted him
at the station. When cries were made
for a speech he appeared on the plat
form of his car and said:
"Indiana is all right."
Crowd Shouted for Mrs. Wilson.
The crowd then shouted for Mrs.
Wilson, but the president told them
sue was resting, and she did not ap
pear. Members of the Indiana Demo
cratic club sent Mrs. Wilson a large
Duncn or American Beauty roses.
President Wilson's advisors believe
he has explained clearly why he con
aiders Immediate preparedness impera
tive, has won many converts to the
movement, and nas given new impetus
to a discussion of thb cause. From the
sympathetic attitude of most of his au
diences, from the enthusiasm his every
appearance in public has evoked, from
the huge crowds which have greeted
them, they hays' drawn the conclusion
that the people overwhelmingly sup
port his plans at least, in the middle
west.
The president's official family want
him to start- soon on another tour.
Some of them liken his swing through
the middle west to an operation not
yet' completed. En route to Washing
ton tonight, they looked both south
and west for the Eetting of his next
appearance in the role of champion of
national preparedness.
The south beckoned with many
hands. Senators and representatives
rrom most of the southern states al
ready have asked him to Include their
sections on his next tour. To this have
been added invitations from many pub
lie. bodies, with Texas strongly assert
ing her' claims. -" -There is a feeling
among some of his most intimate ad
visors that in choosing the scene for
nis next plea to the people the presi
dent could pay no greater compliment
to nis own political party than by go
ing into its stronghold.
Considering Trip Further West.'
The west and northwest, or at least
that section of the country that fringes
the eastern slopes of the Rocky moun
tains, are hardly less insistent that the
president next visit shall be to them.
Minneapolis, St. Paul and Denver have
presented what - they consider strong
claims, and it is known that a trip to
tnese cities is receiving careful con
sideration. If the president makes an
other preparedness tour it may be a
combination of the two a swing to the
northwest, including Minneapolis or St.
Paul, or both, Denver, and then south
into Texas, possibly returning by way
or Aew Orleans, Birmingham or Louis-
viiie.
Refreshed by the Trip.
President Wilson goes back to
Washington refreshed by the trip. The
enthusiasm displayed - wherever his
itinerary has taken him, the throngs
which flocked to hear him, have been a
tonic to his nerves. His physician
said today his appetite is good and his
rest has been unimpaired. ' The ad
dresses delivered at the chief stopping
places nave oeen apparently as bene
flcial as his usual game of golf.
100,000 Heard His Speeches.
At least 100,000, his advisors est!
mate, heard the president's chief
speeches. At least 50,000 more crowd
ed about the rear platform of his car
during his five-minute talks, though
the great majority of these were out
of the range of his voice. Hardly fewer
than half a million others have been
banked on the sidewalks to watch him
pass through the cities from railway
sattion to hotel, from auditorium back
to his private car. .
Believes Country With Him.
Reviewing his trip In its high lights
the president told his audience in St.
Louis today that he came away from
Washington thinking that the country
was with him on the issue of prepar
edness and is going back knowing that
it is with him beyond his greatest
hopes. Apparently the president's
conviction of this grew with each suc
ceeding day; deepened in Kansas City
last night when he asked: "Would you
volunteer?" and receiving a thundering
"Yes!" from every section of the great
convention hall, and reached its cli
max with the demonstration today at
St. Louis when he told an audience
which cheered him tumultuously that
the United States ought to have "in
comparably the greatest navy in the
world." .
LYNCHINGS DENOUNCED . BY
GOV. HARRIS OF GEORGIA
Threatens to Ask Legislature for

Atlanta, Ga., Feb. 3. Lynchings of
more than a dozen negroes in Geor
gia recently Is denounced by Govern
or Harris in a -statement today in
which he declares that "unless con
ditions improve by the time the next
general assembly meets." he will ask

laws to stop lynching in this state."
The general assembly meets in June.
CAUSE OF INCREASED
- PRICE OF GASOLINE
Shortage of Supply .and an Increase
In Consumption.
Washington, Feb. 3. The greatly!
increased price of gasoline. Secretary
Lane reported to the senate today in
response to a resolution, is caused by
shortage of supply and an increase in
consumption. He recommended that
the situation be relieved by the use
of heavier distillates in internal com.
bustion engines. .

Dispatches on
Lusitania Here
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN DE
LIVERED TO PRESIDENT
WHILE EN ROUTE HOME
Details Not Disclosed Believed to bs
Satisfactory Because 8tay of Col.
House In Berlin Was Not as Long as
Planned.
Washington. Feb. 8. Despatches on
the Lusitania situation from Colonel
E. M. House, now on a special mis
sion In Europe, for President wii
son, are believed to have 'been deliv
ered to the president today on his
special train.
Colonel House discussed the situa'
tion with hle-h German officials, in
forming them of the position of the
United States and receiving in return
first hand information of their view
point. Details were not disclosed in
such despatches as have been received
here, but they reported Colonel House
found It unnecessary to remain in
Berlin as long as he originally had
Intended. .
House Talked with German Officials,
It is said that Colonel House prob
ably discussed subjects other than the
Lusitania case with German officials.
but that the Lusitania situation occu
pied the major portion of his des
patches to the president.
The semi-official statement of the
foreign office forwarded to this coun
try, that there "was reasonable" hope
that a communication which " had
been started to Count Von Bernstorff
would prove satisfactory to the
United States is taken In official and
diplomatic quarters to mean Germany
has not accepted the tentative form
or proposal exactly as It was sub
mitted. The opinion and hope was
expressed by diplomats in a position
to be familiar with the status of the
negotiations, that the cardinal points
set forth in the tentative form ap
proved by Secretary Lansing remain
ed.
It was said here that there are cer
tain words which the Berlin officials
believe could not be included In. the
final settlement of the controversy be
cause of concern for German public
opinion. It was thought certain that
this, phrase had been explained to
Colonel House and that he in turn
has conveyed the explanations to
President Wilson.
It was said tonight that the lan-
ruase In toe tentative form nf nro
posals submitted to Secretary Lansing
last week in regard to Germany's ex
pressed hope that the United .States
do everything possible' toward secur
ing rreedom of the seas had been re
vised considerably because It was con
sidered the words used might have
conveyed the impression that Ger
many was making that - ouestion a
condition of settlement. This, it was
explained, was in no wise the lnten
tion of the German government.
In Lansing's Hands Today.
The latest communication to Count
Bernstorff had not, it was said at
the embassy, arrived In Washington
tonight. it is expected tomorrow.
Unless present plans fail through de
lay In delivering the despatch to the
German ambassador, the . tentative
form of settlement as now suggested
by the German government, should be
in Secretary Lansing's hands before
the president returns to Washington
tomorrow or soon thereafter.
BRITISH PRISONERS HAVE
LEFT STEAMER APPAM
Only the Prize Commander and Hi
Crew of Germans Aboard.
Newport News, Va.. Feb. 3. Nine
teen days of ceaseless vigilance by a
short-handed German prize crew
aboard the former British liner Appam
ended late tonight when the last of
more than 400 British prisoners climb
ed over the ship's side to liberty on
American soil. And for the first time
since Lieutenant Bergre and his 22 men
boarded the liner from the raider
which captured her on the night of
Jan. 15 most of the Germans elept
peacefully, with but a few of their
number on watch.
All British subjects and the one nat
uralized American quit the ship, leav
ing the prize commander with his crew
and the 20 Germans who had been
prisoners on the Appam, including
three women.
Captain Harrison and the Appam' s
British crew left their vessel only after
a sharp controversy between agents of
the owners, Elder Dempster company,
and the British embassy at Washing
ton. COLOMBIAN MINISTER
ISSUES A STATEMENT
Expressing Disapproval of Amendment
to Reduce Indemnity.
Washington, Feb. 3. While the Co
lombian treaty was being brought into
the senate today Julio Betincourt, the
Colombian minister, was issuing a
statement expressing his disapproval
of the amendments- to reduce the in
demnity the United States would pay
Colombia from C5.000,00 to $15,000,
000 and to make the expressions of re
gret for the partition of Panama mu
tual to both nations.
Minister Betincourt was certain that
the treaty, already accepted and rati
fied by his country, would be rejected
now with the proposed amendment.
There were suggestions in Latin
American quarters that the minister
was considering whether It would be
an expedient and diplomatic method of
expressing disapproval if he left the
legation and returned to Bogota.

COLLIER 8UNK BY
A RAIDING ZEPPELIN.
Thirteen of the Crew, Including tht
Captain, Drowned.
London, Feb. S, 9. SO p. rn. The col
lier Franc Fischer, which left Hartle
pool Monday, afternoon, was sank at
sea - by one of the raiding Zeppelins
which visited 'England. Thirteen oi
the crew, including the captain, were
drowned.
Three men were saved. Chief Engl-
neer Birch, Steward Taylor and Sea
man Charles Hillier. The Franz Fischer
was a captured enemy vessel employed
as a coasting collier.
Hinier, who is a native of Newfound
land, described the disaster as foW
lows:
"About 10.80 o'clock Tuesday nigh
we heard a noise overhead, such as we
had never heard before. Presently a
Zeppelin came right on top of us and
dropped a bomb which fell near the
engine room. A tremendous explosion
followed, the vessel remaining afloat
only two minutes.
"There was no time to launch life
boats. We all went under with the
ship. When I came up again I caught
hold of a lifebelt. After swimming
for some time, I came across the chief
engineer and the steward, who had
also managed to get hold of lifebelts.
By their aid we kept afloat for an
hour.
"It was pitiful to hear the cries of
some of the other-men who had come
to the surface after the-disappearance
of the vessel, -but soon their cries
ceased and we concluded they were all
drowned. Meanwhile we continued
shouting for help. When we were al-,
most exhausted, a Belgian steamer
heard us, lowered a boat and picked
us up. Subsequently we were trans
ferred to a mine-sweeper and landed."
Asked how the Zeppelin managed to
locate the vessel in the dark, Hillier
said the collier was riding at anchor
and her anchor lights must have been
seen by the men in the Zeppelin. As
the vessel was stationary, it was easy
to drop a bomb on her.
PACIFIC NORTHWEST BATTLING
WITH A SEVERE SNOWSTORM.
Which 'Has Paralyzed Rail Communi
cation and Disorganized City Life.
Seattle, Wash, Feb. 3. The Paclflo
northwest today again faced the task
of battling with an almost unprece
dented snowstorm which has paralyzed
rail communication, disorganized city
life, held residents in outlying sections
snowbound and caused many thou
sands of dollars' damage to buildings
which were not strong enough to with
stand the weight of more than two and
a naif feet of snow on their roofs. With
continued cold weather and more snow
in prospect the outlook is not promis
ing today for early resumption of nor
mal conditions.
All the northern transcontinental
railroads are tied up by snow in the
mountain passes, and railroad officials
have abandoned hope of raising the
blockade until the storm ends.
In Seattle and other cities street car
lines are completely blocked by snow.
Schools are closed and business is
practically suspended, awaiting the end
of the storm. The greatest single loss
from the storm occurred in Seattle,
where the dome of St. James' Catholic
cathedral collapsed under the weight
of snow yesterday, causing damage to
the, edifice of $75,000.
