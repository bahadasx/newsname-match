, cess, If any, was being met with by
the leaders In their new effort, was
not learned.
In some Democratic quarters there
was still talk of Edgar F. Hood as a
candidate for the Democratic nomination
for mayor. Mr. Hood, however,
has not as yet made announcement
of his candidacy.
Present Indications are that Ken-;
neth Sapplngton will have no opponent
for the Democratic nomination
for chief of police. Although he has
not yet announced himself as a can-!
didate, there seems to be no doubt!
whatever but that Mr. Sapplngton j
will be a candidate.
Rumors afloat today had It that
W. R.. Johnson, city clerk for one
term and Democratic candidate for
i mat posmon in xnxo, wouin enter
i the race for the Democratic nomination
for that position. Democratic
i leaders, howeTer, said they knew
i nothing of Mr. JohnBon's Intentions.
: On the Republican side there are
two new entrants Into the races for

the United Statee has decided to hold I
that the Prussian-American treaty
governs the case of the Appam, as
Germany contends that all that remained
to be decided was the interpretation
of the application of the
treaty's ter-ms."
ThdSecretary disclosed further
that the sole question to be decided
bv the interpretation was how long
the Appam should be permitted to
remain in American waters. The
treaty guarantees to a German prize
the right to come and go freely. If
the Appam were forced to depart it
would doubtless become the prey of
British cruisers outside the Virginia
capes. If forced, to the part, German
ofilcials have stated the ship j
would be sunk.

The fire originated In the kitchen of

have been caused by an explosion of
gas. The light In the kitchen was left1
burning when the Weckleys retired1
Thursday night, and an explosion of
some kind is thought to have set the
wall paper on fire.
Mr. Weekly was awakened by the
heat, from the flames and had barely
time to rouse his wife and throe children
and get out of the house In safety.
They lost all their household goods,
and in addition (80 in currency was :

SEillS CRISIS
Of the War Arises in Connection
with Lusitania Case,
is the Belief of Berlin.
( V AMOCtATID PIUII
BERLIN, Feb, 24.?The view entertained
here that one of the moBt
Bcrloue crisis of the war hiia arisen
In connection with the Lusitania case
and that it Is Impossible to foresee
.the outcome from any Indications
here. The result of the negotiations
appears to hinge solely upon tne one
wbrd "Illegal." Iu the way of an 1
agreement between the United States
and Germany stand only seven letters
expressing, the conception which
President Wilson and Secretary Lan- J
sing Insist must bo embodied In the
German formula expressing regret; 1
for the loss of American lives aboard i 1
the Cunarder. The Associated Press't
Is Informed authoritatively that Ger- t
many cannot and will not designate I
as illegal the sinking of a llnor by any c
submarine. (
Virtually no other difficulties In c
the way of settlement romaln and the e
new Instructions forwarded to Ambassador
von Bernstorff on Tuesday
contain meroly the new formula by
which it Is hopod to satisfy Washington,
without humllltatlng this
country. Although the suggested /
sentence, according to a reliable version
consists of only eight words ami
does not contain the word "Illegal"
or characterize tho sinking of the
Lusltanla as such It goes to otherwise
the furtherest extent possible toward
meeting American desires. j
