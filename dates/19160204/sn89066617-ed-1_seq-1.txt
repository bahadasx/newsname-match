COMEDY TONIGHT
Unusual Demand For Seats
Indicates House Will Be

If the demand for tickets can be
called a barometer of the interest ta
ken in the Big Minstrel show, which
opens at the Park theater this even
ing, the entertainment is an assured
success. More than "00 tickets were
reserved yesterday, which surpassed
expectations.
Charles V. Boutin, who is looking
after ticket sales, stated, last right
that he anticipated a crowded he;: -3
each evening. The sale of ticket.? has
been large, but only about one third
of the purchaser have reserved their
seats.
Mr. Boutin oiled up his money fin
gers yesterday in order that he will be
able to prevent any filthy lucre get
ting away from him this evening. He
will receive tickets and look after the
change.
The Elks last night left the door un
locked when the dress rehearsal was
"pulled off" and a peek at some of the
city's best known young men in silky
costumes, quickly impresses one that
tonight's show will have real merit.
The minstrels who will show their
faces tonight expect and invite cab
bages or tomatoes if their acting
doesn't cr.ie i" '- Ih:- rrralde.! rtand
ard, the management announced last
night.
On the other hand, it is under
stood on the q. that the Elks, who
will be ushers, have provided -a big
box filled with bouquets, one for eaca.
of the performers, if he makes a hit.
These will be gracefully, unostenta
tiously, perhaps even modestly lugged
down the aisle to the foot-lights and
hoisted up to the charmer.
Of course they didn't practice on that
feature receiving the bouquets last
night at the dress rehearsal, but it
was easy to imagine how the broad
smile could play over W. Falmer Oli
ver's features as he will modestly ac
cept the token of someone's esteem.
Mr. Oliver you will recognize him
by his bass voice is what, in common
everyday minetrels shows, would be
called the E..d Men. In this show he
and Tony Gockel, Robert Xunn, and
George Boltz are called "Apostles of
Sunshine." Their facial appearance
alone, leaving out some of the verbos
ity that they will cut loose, suggest.'?
that perhaps "Apostles of Moonshine"
might have been a more descriptor?
phrase.
Chris Stiver is the only white mr.n
in the whole show who looks serious
about it ,and that's because he has io
he's the receiving end of all jokes, h
id the interlocutor! Chris has to s'ng
a song too!
It was reported a while ago that all
the hack drivers and hearse men had
been requested for the loan of their
plug hats. There were rot enough
hearses and hacks in town to go
around, so the wardrobe boss has b.icn
forced to hand out some fancy lid.
The "biled" while, war-time dickey;
will be there.
The most export colored "gemmen"
of the troupe will be Bob Beckman,
Leon Haman, Khr.er Hainan, Art
Wiclpuetz, Paul Finney, ChaiW
Elackledger and Pooch Gaines. They
are mentioned on the program as

The Sweet Southern Singers will be
William Schad, Norman Mozley, Gus
Walther, Oliver "Doc" Edwards.

called "Beaux Ideals of Melody" In
this class will be Eddie Gockel, Leon
Bahn, Yorwell Lane, Russell Deal,
Gather Ranney, "Hap" Gaines, Charles
Blattner and Charles B'ack.
At one stage Elmer Haman is going
to sing a song about a chicken dinner

clog dancing as he wails his tune,
"Loading Up the Mandy Lee."

The ship, attempting to escape, kept
up a constant fire at the submarine,
which bombarded the liner in return.
British members of the Cabinet, who

Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Kansas City, Mo., Feb. 2. Presi
dent Wilson tonight for the first time
sounded the warning that peril men
aces the United States from its west
ern coast. After declaring that the
whole world is on fire, and that the
United States may become involved at
any time, he said:
"If these flames creep in on the
United States, it may creep in on both
coasts. . Do you know that great sweep
up the Western coast from the Canal
to Alaska. And that great sweep up
from the Gulf of Mexico to the St.
Lawrence.
"There are many good harbors and
many cities that would be open to at
tack. Do you think that a navy that
ranks fourth is good enough to guard
these long expanses?"
The crowd cheered his sensational
remarks and yelled a husky reply to
every question he asked. It was the
largest crowd that has yet heard the
President on his preparedness tour,
and the big throng was with him. More
than 15,000 people jammed into the au
ditorium and they gave hira their undi
vided attention.

by the President. He intimated tonight that he would accuse the Chief Ex

OPTION ON PARK
EXPIRES TODAY
Mayor Kage Says Delay With
Bonds Ought Not To
Effect Purchase.
Today marks the expiration of the
option held by the City for the pur
chase of the Fairgrounds as a city
park, and last night the city officials
had not received the $40,000 city bonds
iouh uiuc imcj
sent two weeKs ago to Do registered.
As soon as the bonds are returned
from Jefferson City they will be turn
ed over to the Sturdivant Bank, the
purchasers, and the final negotiations
in the deal for the purchase of the
park from the Fair Association will be
concluded. .
Attorney K. B. Oliver, Jr., already
has drawn the deed which will be used
in making the transfer of the property
to the city, and if the bonds are re
ceived in today's mails, the Mayor and
other proper officials may make a trip
to the home of Charles Blattner on the
Bloomfield road, to have his signature
attached to the deed, thus completing
the sale.
Mayor Kage yesterday discussed the
eventuality of the bonds' failure to ar
rive from Jefferson City today and de
clared that he does not believe that a
delay of a day or two at this time will
affect the sale of the park to the city.
The Fair Association's offer to the
city has been accepted by the city's
vote in favor of the bond issue with
which the park is to be acquired, he
said, and the small hitch in the pro
ceedings should make no difference in
closing the sale.
The mutual uaderstanding between
the city officials and the directors of
the Park Board is such that no action
has been taken by the Fair Board to
grant the city another extension in the
time of the option. It was not deem
ed necessary.
The bonds were sent to Jefferson
City two weeks ago today and nothing
was heard from the Auditor until
Tuesday, when City Clerk Frisscll re
ceived a reply to a telegram he sent in
quiring about the bonds. It was stated
in the telegram that the securities
would be examined at once and for
warded to the Cape. It 'cost $40 to
have the bonds registered and a war
tax was levied in addition.

HENRI BOSSE SUES
FRATERNAL LODGE
Seeks To Recover $291.45 From
Knights and Laoies of
Security.
Henri Basse, an employe of the Cape
Brewery & Ice Co., and who lives at
1S06 Bloomfield street, yesterday filed
a suit in the Common Pleas Court
against the Knights and Ladies of Se
curity, to recover $291.45, premiums
and interest he has paid on an insur
ance policy in that order.
The filing of the suit reveals that
Mr. Bosse has been debarred from
he privileges of membership in the
M-der last June, and the lodge refused
'o accept the money he offered in pay
nrnt of his premiums.
Mr. Bosse is an old resident of the
Cape and is well known here. He

vas granted to him so that he began
naying dues for march at the rate of
52...0 a month on a $2,000 policy.
He declares that he paid his pre
miums regularly for all months from
March, 1907 to May 1915, inclusive,
and in all paid the order 5227.30. In
Tune, last ,he made a tender of the
money and it was rejected and since
that time, he asserts, he has made
er.der of the money each month to the

clined. The petition also declares that with
out notifying him of any charges
gainst him and without giving him
m opportunity to make a defense to

Ten Thousand Acres of Rich Farm
ing Land Inundated as Mississippi
Breaks Over Bank, South of De
vil's Island.
CAPT. JAYNES SUFFERS LOSS OF
$3,000 HE SAYS TO FALL WHEAT
Controversy Over Cost of Four
Acres of Land Is Blamed For
Tremendous Loss Live Stock
Perishes East of East Cape.
A break in the levee, just south of Devil's Island, yesterday morning,
flooded 10,000 acres of rich farming land, causing a damage estimated at
i $100,000. The land inundated is some
'of the Mississippi bottoms, and 175 acres of excellent fall wheat, belonging
to Capt. A. C. Jaynes of this city, was destroyed.
j The collapse of the levee was a result of a cave-in which occurred dur-
ing the high water last summer. Arrangements wore just being made to
repair the break, and workmen were on the scene when the present flood
came.
Capt. Jaynes, who is one of the East t'apo Girardeau & Clear Creek
Levee and Drainage commissioners, returned from the flooded district late
yesterday, after spending the day there,
levee repair men.
The ferryboat Gladys, which belongs
to Capt. Jaynes, was kept busy yester
day rescuing livestock from the flood
ed lands. One hundred head of thor
oughbred cattle, eighty hogs and about
fifty mules were landed safely in this
city yesterday. These were driven
from the farms that are now flooded
before the water broke out of the
river channel.
Great quantities of live stock, Capt
Jaynes stated, will not be taken from
the lowlands. Xo effort was made to
rescue chickens, small hogs and hun
dreds of head of other livestock, be
cause of the rapidity with which the
overflow water rushed across the
stricken area.
Earnest Caldwell, a farmer living
near the break in the levee, lost heav
ily. Some of his most valuable live
stock were brought to this city last
night on the Gladys, but many of his
cattle, horses, mules and hogs perish
ed when the river swept over his farm.
Caldwell owns the land that abuts
the river at the point where it broke
over yesterday and which was weaken
ed by the cave-in last summer. Four
acres of ground running up to the
river bank at the break were sought
by the levee and drainage commission,
of which Capt. Jaynes is one of three
members.
"We asked Caldwell to sell us the
land immediately after the cave-in,"
said Capt. Jaynes, "but he wanted us
to pay $1,800, which was more than
the land wa9 worth and more than we
were willing to pay. We considered
J $1,000 the full value of the four acres
and made this offer to Caldwell, but
he declined it repeatedly.
"A short time ago, we offered him
a compromise. We told Caldwell we
would pay $1,350 for the four acres,
provided the taxpayers would approve
of it. We felt this was really in ex
cess of the value of the land, but it
was essential that we get possession
of the ground. We intended to supply
the dirt necessary to rebuild the levee
from these four acres.
"Caldwell finally consented to accept
this offer, with the proviso that the
people ratified our action. Monday
of this week, I went to Cairo to adver
tise the transaction there, because the
land was in the Cairo district, and in
order to make it legal, we were com
pelled to advertise in the Cairo news
papers. I completed my work there as
soon as I could and returned home, be
cause I knew the river was then at a
dangerous depth and it might break
over the weakened levee.
"We put a force of men to work
building a dam, hoping to build up
faster than the water in the river
would rise. But our expectations were
not realized. The water simply climb
ed up until it broke over the cave-in
and then Bwept over the wide area.
There are at least 10,000 acres of land
de leve:

damag:
of the mcst fertile in th rich tracts
directing the work of a corps o
' under this tremendous body of water.
Xincty-five per cent of the land is rich
farms and a large percentage in al
falfa and wheat. Caldwell had a
splendid tract of alfalfa. While alfal
fa will prevent ground from washing,
the grass cannot endure a flood. A
field of alfalfa, when once overflowed,
is dead. It will be necessary to re
plant every alfalfa field.
"The wheat is lost also. While
there were many tracts of fall wheat
that were infested with the Hessian
fly, I happened to have a splendid field
of about 175 acres. My loss will be
about $.'5,000, which is insignificant
when compared to the losses sustained
by farmers whose land adjoined min?.
"William X. Leitner, one of the big
stock farmers in the flooded district,
lost much grain in addition to hi a live
stock. He had more than 1,000 bush
els of torn in the field that had nev-r
been gathered. I don't know how
much livestock belonging to him was
washed away, but his loss is large.
Some thoroughbred stock belonging to
Leitner and about 2C0 head belonging
to Ira Hastings, another stockman,
were taken out of the overflowed dis
trict this afternoon by the Gladys.
"While I was in Cairo two days ago,
I telephoned a warning to the farmer.?
in this district to get their stock out
of the danger zone, but they felt they
knew more about it than I did and ig
nored me. Had they driven their
stock to places of safety between the
Vvee opposite the Cape and the strip
of lowland which is now inundated,
we would have been able to rescue
every head of it with the ferryboat.
But the loss will be appalling.
"On my trip to and from Cairo, I
found conditions deplorable in that
territory.
"While I do not believe Cairo is in
any immediate danger, the farm lands
surrounding that city are in a terrible
state. I saw farmers building trestles
out in the middle of their farms, and
upon these they herded their livestock, "
where they will remain until the water
recedes."
Capt. Jaynes informed The Tribune
last night that the river at Cape Girar
deau was at least ?.7 feet. He bases
this upon guages he erected during
low water. "It is the highest I ever
saw, and I have been here more than
a quarter of a century."
John Morrison of the Morrison Ice
& Fuel Company, stated yesterday
that the Frisco trestle over the creek,
just south of the ice plant ha3 been
torn loose from its moorings and has
been afloat during the past two days.
When a train pasess over it, he said,
the trestle sinks to a depth of almost
one foot.
E. Alley, a farmer, living west of
Chaffee, lost nine colts and three head
of cattle by the flood yesterday. They
were caught in a field by the high wa
ter and washed down the river.
