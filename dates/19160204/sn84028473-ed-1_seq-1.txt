Guirc an Irish American who has vis
ited Erins green isle England Ger
many and the other warring nations of
Europe These books are prohibited
from circulating in Ireland and Can
ada but all Americans should read
them 330 pages each at 1 The
author shows the utter impossibility
of conquering Germany and that Ire
lands only hope of future prosperity
and greatness lies in being taken from
under English rule and placed under
that of Germany and he suggests
many good reasons for doing so
among them being a comparison of
Ireland In olden Umes with that of
being under English rule the super
iority of German scientific methods in
farming and manufacturing together
with the prosperity of her people
when England resolved a year ago to
starve out Germany ho saw women
and children In England hunting
through garbage cans for something
to eat that Germany haB more to eat
and more munitions or war today than
she had one year ago The people of
