Back from an apparently successful

national preparedness. President
Wilson today found his work in
that direction merely beginning,
it was asserted by high officials
of the administration. Although he
may have triumphed in getting
the ear of the people, he is confronted
by a stubborn Congress,

The President, it is known, received
advices from Washington during his j
absence, and these advices did not en- I

speeches as he has apparently made in I

Some administration leaders, close to
the President, too. were showing signs j
today of being out of patience with the
democratic division in Congress, and
expressing the hope that the President
(will cease his efforts to influence opposition
to his program through appeal
to public sentiment and get right

the conditions in House and Senate. He

* There are intimations that he will

that if he wants results in Congress he

% That may not be the refined style of
politics that the President stands for.
it was suggested today, but it might
be more effective than the long-distance

It was the practically unanimous
opinion today that Congress is in a bad

definite is in sight; that there .are all,

Probable Origin of Fire.
The fire is believed to have started in
the kitchen. When it was discovered
flames were shooting up the elevator
shaft and soon afterward the entire
building was burning. There were not
many guests in the house, but most of
them were around in time to escape.
Their exit was cut off and most of them
had to jump from windows.
One woman was seen to faint after
calling for help from an upper window
and was burned to death while her
body lay across the sill in view of hundreds
of persons unable to help her.
The engineer of the hotel hung out of
a window until the fire reached his
hands and caused him to drop to the
street. He was killed almost instantly.
Another woman who managed to
crawl out of a window fell and also
lost her life.

HEARING IS BEGUN !
ON POWER PLANT
Opponents of Proposed Plans
Tell Senate Committee
Their Objections.
POINT TO THE DANGER
FROM THE SMOKESTACKS
Favorable Report Asked on Newlands
Amendment. Providing for
VS-1 *? v* - TTT 1_
ueiay in Beginning worn.
Arguments for and against the
proposed new central heating
plant for the government, to be
located opposite the bureau of
engraving and printing, was
heard by the Senate library committee
today. The committee
has before it a resolution offered
by Senator Xewlands of Nevada,
providing that the work of construction
of this plant shall not
be begun until the plans have
been approved by the fine arts
commission and by the President.
An amendment embodying this
prohibition has been inserted in
the urgent deficiency appropriation
bill by the Senate, and that j
bill is now in conference between)
Uie two houses.
State Their Objections.
Should the Senate library committee
determine that the Xewlands resolution
should be adopted, however, it will go
to. the Senate with a favorable report
on it.
The opponents of the new central
plant, who urge that the huge smokestacks.
belching forth smoke, will disfigure
the appearance of the capital,
appearing before fre committee, included
Cass Gilbert of New York, a
member of the fine arts commission;
Glenn Brown and Hennen Jennings.
Edward C. Kemper, secretary of the
American Institute of Architects, also
will appea,r before the committee in
opposition to the plans for the central
plant.
Assistant Secretary Byron R. Newton
of the Treasury Department and James
A. Wetmore, acting supervising architect
of the Treasury, appeared in support
of the plans and urged that the work
on the central plant be not held up. It
was planning to go anead with the
construction work almost Immediately,
and already excavation work has been
begun.
To Have But Two Smokestacks.
That the new central power plant is
to have two smokestacks and not four
was brought out at a hearing before
the Senate library committee today.
Strong protests had been made to the
committee because of the stacks, which
are to be 195 feet high, on the ground that
they would disfigure the appearance of
the National Capital.
A letter from Elliott Woods, superintendent
of the Capitol buildings and
grounds, was referred to by Chairman
Williams of/ the committee in which
Mr. Woods suggested that the present
Capitol power plant, located near Garfield
Park, could be enlarged and made
posed central plant. Senator Williams
said that the committee had asked for
Mr. Woods' opinion on the subject.
Mr. Wetmore described to the com.
mittee the plans for the central plant,
showing that it was designed to provide.
heat, light and power for all the
government buildings west of and including
?he Post Office Department. He
told the committee that the present site
i had been chosen because it was scienjtifically
and mechanically idea! for the
I location-**/ such a plant.
' Tie said that it was near the water
' which had to be used for condensation
purposes: that ic was near railroad
! tracks which could be used for reniov|
Ing ashas, and that It was very near
I the bureau of engraving and printing,
i which would use about 25 ner cent of
j the power generated by the new plant.
Would Effsct Great Slaving.
He said that :i would effect a very
great saving annually in the amount
expended for heat, light and power for
the government buildings.
Senator Williams interrupted to say
that the commttee had to consider the
beauty of Washington as well as the
question of saving money.
Mr. Gilbert of the fine arts commission
brought out the fact that the plans
as now provided called for only two
smokestacks, though at first they had
made provision for four such stacks.
Senator Cummins of Iowa, who, with
Senator Newlands and Senator Williams,
attended the meeting, asked Mr.
Wetmore why the plans for the central
plant had not been submitted to
the fine arts commission for its approval
in time for the commission to
pass on them before all plans for going
ahead with the work were so far underway.
Mr. Wetmore replied that the failure
to submit the plans to the commission
had been an oversight and not intentional.
He explained that he had
thought the former supervising architect
had submitted the plans before he
want mil nf nfflpa Wlipn hl? attpntinn
was called to the matter the plans wer^
sent to the commission.
Urges Further Investigation.
Lewis B. Stillwell, a New York engineer,
discussed before the committee
the question of central power plants
and told what had been done along this
line in other cities. He said that he
thought the office of the supervising
architect should go into this matter
more fully before continuing with the
present plans for the central power
plant.
Senator Williams suggested to the officials
of/the Treasury Department that
the comihittee would like to have submitted
to it for consideration perspective
drawing of the proposed building.
Senator Cummins asked Mr. Gilbert if
it would be possible to construct the
central power plant without the objectionable
stacks. Mr. Gilbert replied that
it would be possible. /
He said, however, that such a plan
had been adopted in connection with
the building of a plant near the state
capitol building in St. Paul, Minn., and
that the gases from the plant had
been so objectionable that later the
smokestacks had been erected. Mr.
Gilbert said that he feared such a
'course weuld be found necessary if
.the. government undertook to erect k
plant without smokestacks on the^presMi
site, ftnd tbat tb? employe* in Urn

might be seriously inconvenienced if
the gases were allowed to escape.
Cost of Special Apparatus.
A similar question was put to X. S.
Thompson, chief mechanical and electrical
engineer of the office of the
supervising architect. He replied that
it would be possible to do away with
the stacks by installing a special apparatus,
but that it would cost some $88,000
for installation and would add
greatly to the .cost of the upkeep of
the plant.
Senator Williams suggested that it
might be wise to ask the bureau of
stanuaras n me gases generaieu vy
the plant could be used as by-products.
Mr. Thompson suggested that the proposed
central power plant would be
ideally located for use as a steam auxiliary
plant in case the government
should undertake the development of
the proposed Great Falls power plant.
He said it was a recognized fact
that such auxiliary steam plants were
needed in the case of hydro-electric
power plants.
Will Receive Written Statements.
At the close of the hearing. Senator
Williams announced that the committee
would receive written statements
from any persons who desired to submit
them in regard to the power plant.
He also stated that if any witnesses
desired to be heard they could appear
at the regular meeting of the committee
next week.
Senator Williams expressed the opinion
later that his committee would use
whatever moral suasion it could to prevail
upon the appropriations committee
to have some plan adopted whereby the
objectionable smokestacks could be
lowered or eliminated.
Senator Newlands laid before the Senate
tod a 5* a telegram from the Merchants'
Association of New York, protesting
against t he erection of the power
plant on the plan now provided. The
association declared that it is necessary
to safeguard the beauty of the National
Capital.

Paris Newspapers Insist Heir to

PARIS, February 4. 4:45 a.m.?Dispatches
to the Paris newsnanera r-nn. 1
tain insistent suggestions that Prince
Yussof Izzedin, heir to th? Turkish
throne, whose death by suicide was reported
February 2, was assassinated.
Emile Galli, formerly editor of the Levant
Herald, and a personal friend of
Prince Yussof, writes as follows to th?
Journal: "Prince Yussof Izxedin foresaw
that he would be assassinated.
Last January he gave an envelope
sealed with his own private seal to a
number of persons, with instructions
that it should be opened only in case he
was murdered.
Yussof Detested Enver. ?
"Yussof detested Enver Pasha on account
of his deeds and of his attitude ,
toward the Germans. He often repeated:
'Enver has let the wolf into the
fold.' Violent scenes occurred between
him and Enver Pasha, especially after
the warships which were formerly the
German vessels Goeben and Breslau
had attacked the Russian fleet in October,
1914. At the instance of Yussof
the sultan also strongly protested to
Einver against tnis action wnicn naciM

threatened the sultan and an angry
altercation followed between Yussof
and Enver." .

He said the criticism had been made
that when the water was allowed to

was complete it drained under some of
the banks and caused the slides that

PRUSSIAN TREATY
GOVERNSAPPAM
Secretary Lansing Now Concerned
About Its Application
to Seized Steamer.
WOULD BE BLOWN UP
IF FORCED TO DEPART
Collector Hamilton, Ship's Purser
and Embassy Attache Confer on
Disposal of Cargo.
Secretary Lansing indicated
today that the United States had
decided to hold that the Prussian American
treaty governs the case
of the Appani, as Germany contends,
and that all that remained
to be decided was the interpretation
of the application of the
treaty's terms.
Under the provisions of the
Prussian-American treaty of 1810
prize vessels have the right to
come to and go freely from ports
of the United States.
Thp Wrptarv further
that the sole question to he de- j
cided by the interpretation was j
how long the Appam should be j
permitted to remain in American
waters. The treaty guarantees to
a German prize the right to come
and go freely.
Would Sink the Ship.
If the Appam were forced to depart
she would doubtless become the proof
British cruisers assembling outside
the Virginia capes. If forced to depart
German officials have stated the ship
would be sunk to prevent her recapture
by the British.
Germany Is expected to contend that
the treaty guarantees to the Appam
the right to remain safe in Hampton
roads until the case goes before a prize
court for adjudication. Technically, the
ship doee not become Germany's prize
until such a court establishes the validity
of her capture.
British Ambassador's Demand.
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British ambassador,
today presented a formal demand
on behalf of his government for
the return to British owners of the
liner A^pam. taken by a German prise |
crew. A new diplomatic controversy |
with Great Britain is foreshadowed, as
the United States practically has decided
to hold the prize is Germany's.
Conference About Ship's Cargo.
NEWPORT NEWS. February 4.?
Collector of Customs Xorman P. Hamilton
is in close conference this morning
with Prince von Hatzfelcft, counselor
of the German embassy at Washington:
Lieut. Ber$, commander of the
German prize crew which brought the
captured British liner Appam into this I
port: Purser Parker of the Appam and
Postmaster Mugler of Newport News,
discussing the disposition of the large
quantity of mail on board the Appam.
German Vice Consul von Schilling of
Hampton is now on his way here to
participate in the conference, which is
being held behind closed doors at the
customshouse.
Collector Hamilton stated over the
telephone while the conference was in
progress that he expected a final de
cision to oe reached shortly and that
the mail would then "be removed from
the liner. All other questions remaining:

at this conference, the collector said,
and it is hardly probable that his presence
on the Appam will be necessary
again today. Prince von Hatzfeldt expected
to return to Washington at 1
o'clock this afternoon.
Only Prize Crew on Board.
Only Lieut. Berg: and his small prize
crew remained today aboard the former
British passenger steamer Appam,

raider off the Canary Islands January
lo, were liberated last night by
arder of the United States government.
The passengers today were aboard
the Old Dominion liner Jefferson en
route for New York, where they were
expected to arrive early tonight. The
members of the crew, with the gun
pointers taken from other British
steamers which the raider sank before
the Appam was overhauled, were in
Norfolk awaiting the sailing of another
New York steamer tonight. Both
passengers and crew were transferred
from the Appam to tugs and taken to
Norfolk on river steamers.
The Appam is to remain at this port
until the Washington government derides
what disposition of her shall be
made?whether she shall be held a fair
prize of her German captors under the
Prussian-American treaty or returned

convention. No guard has been placed
over the vessel by the United States,
but Lieut. Berg has given his word
that the steamer Will not be moved until
the diplomatic questions involved in
her disposition shall have been decided. -J

BERLIN TO REFUSE
DISAVOWAL TO U.S.
IN LUSITANIA CASE
Teutons Foresee Serious
Crisis in War Over Word
"Illegal."
NEW INSTRUCTIONS ARE
LIMIT OF CONCESSIONS*
German Officials Will Not Surrender
the Right of Submarines
to Sink Liners.
MEET ALL OTHER DEMANDS
Say That to Repudiate Action la
Question Would Make All U
Boat Warfare Contrary
to Law.
BERLIN", February 4. via London,
1^:20 p.m. ? Information
reaching the Associated Press today
indicates that under no circumstances
will Germany admit
that the sinking of the Lusitania
was an illegal act.
The new instructions forwarded
to Ambassador von Bernstorff,
according to this information,
contains simply one phrase of the
new formulation of the proposed
note of regret 'for the sinking of
the Lusitania. The suggested
sentence is short, consisting of
only eight words, and does not
contain the word "illegal." It
represents the extreme limit of
Germany's concessions in the
Lusitania case.
Foresee Serious Crisis.
The view is entertained here that W?
of the most serious crises of the war
hees aiysen in connection with the Lusitania
case, and that it is impossible to
foresee the outcome from any indications
here. The result of the negrotia
tions appears to hinge solely on the
single word "illegal." In the way of \
an agreement between the United
States and Germany stand only the
seven letters expressing the conception
which President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing insist must be embodied in the
German formula expressing regret for
the loss of American lives aboard the
Cunarder. The Associated Press is informed
positively and authoritatively
that Germany cannot and will not designate
as illegal the sinking of a liner
by any submarine.
Virtually no other difficulties in the
way of settlement remain, and the new
instructions forwarded to Ambassado;
von BernStorfT Tuesday contain znerelv
the new formula by which it is liopeu
to satisfy Washington without humiliating
this country. Although the suggested
sentence, according to a reliable
version, consists of only eight words
and does not contain the word "illegal"
or characterize the sinking of the Lus'tania
as such it goes otherwise to
the furthest extent possible toward
meeting American desires.
"Must Not Humiliate Germany.'*
Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, under secretary
for foreign affairs. in an interview
with the Associated Press, expressed
the hope that the new formula
forwarded to Ambassador von BernstorlT
would offer a possible basis of
settlement. However, he made noeifort
to conceal the arravity of the situation
and was most explicit in his
statements that Germany had reached
the extreme limit of concessions ar.?;
under no circumstances would concede
the illegality of her submarine campaign
in the war area. "The govern
ment is willing to do everything in itpower
and has done everything it it*
power, to meet American wishes," he
said, "but there are limits beyond
which even friendship snaps.
"1 do not understand America's
course. We had thought the submarine
issue settled and the Lusitania
question 011 the way to arrangement?had
agreed to pay indemnity and a)'
that?when the United States suddenlv
made its new demands, which it is im
possible for us to accept.
"You must not push your demand*
too far. You must not attempt to humiliate
Germany."
Crisis 011 the Disavowal.
Dr. Zimmerman n declined to discus?
these new demands or the instructions
to Count von Bernstorff more precisely
but he left no doubt that the whoh
crisis centers on Secretary Lansing'
demand that Germany disavow th?sinking
of the Lusitatiia as an act contrary
to international law. The unde.
secretary declared repeatedly that Germany
could not possibly admit thi.;
procedure was illegal or make concessions
which virtually would take the
submarine weapon out of her hand''
He asserted ugain and again that i.'
the United States desired to drive matters
to a breach Germany could go no
further to avoid it, and that the b?eac?
with all its lamentable consequence-,
must come.
The most regrettable phase of tho
situation, he asserted, was that thcr.s
existed no really important reason for
a breach, no conflicts of interest between
Germany and the United State .
Sermany, he said, was counting on re.
dprocal development of trade wit a
America after the war. These hopes
would be dashed, or, at any rate, their
levelopment would be hampered
greatly, if a breach were to come now;
t>ut Germany would do no more.
