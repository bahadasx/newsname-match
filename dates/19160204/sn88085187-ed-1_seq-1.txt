GERMANY WONT BACK DOWN
His Way Home
One of the best editorials we have seen in the last month appears in the
current Colliers under the meaningful title, "The Way Home." Will you, Mr.
Average Tacoman, give as good an account of yourself on YOUR way home?
Read it and answer for yourself:
Two little boys of under ten were skating on a thinly frozen canal in
Jersey City. The ice broke and they disapeared in the water. That
would have been the end of the story had it not been for a young man
named Ira Stringham. He had left his office in Manhattan as usual and
was on his everyday walk home after his day's work when he saw the
accident.
Without an instant's pause he raced out and dived into the black hole
where the boys had vanished. And he got them. Then he tried to raise
the boys to safety on to the ice, though time after time the brittle ice at
the edge of the hole broke and let them into the water. But at last, with
the aid of ropes thrown from the bank, both youngsters were hauled to
shore—and life.
Ira Stringham did not follow them. He clutched feebly at the rim of
the ice, but his strength had been exhausted and his hand could not keep
its grip. They got his body an hour later. "There was nothing to dis
tinguish this from countless other cases," you say; "hundreds of soldiers
are doing as much every day." So they are, fired by the call which sum
mons them to a glorious end and sustained by the example of their com
rades. But Ira Stringham heard no.siu-.i«.i11. No one would have termed..
him a coward had be paused, weighed chances, reasoned, "If I go after
them, we shall ALL be drowned," and let the moment pass.
He chose differently. He was something more than a mere slave to
duty. His twenty-one years of life may not have been great. But he sud
denly came to real greatness that night as he went home.

early this morning, Leta Sartorla,
age 7, was probably fatally burn

caught fire, enveloping her la
flames.
The little girl arose at 6
o'clock this morning, intending
to start the fire and creep back
into bed while the rooms ware
warming up.
Dressed only In a nightie of

match to the end of a newspaper
which was to serve her as a
torch.

In a flash the small flame
caught at her nightgown which
went up like so much powder,
scorching her lender skin.
She was badly burned about
the back and shoulders and face,
the skin having been burned
sway in many places. She was
hurried to St. Joseph's hospital,
where she is being attended by
Dr. Nace. She is not expected
to live.
Leta is the daughter of James

Ex^el Drivers
For Charging
10 Cent Fares
Two drivers operating jitneys
under the Tacoma Auto associa
tion will be expelled from the as
sociation for charging 10 and 15
cent fares during the recent had
weather, it was announced today.
Secetary Wilson said although
It cost the drivers more than 5
cents a passenger to operate, the
association did not propose to
stand for a violation of the city
registration laws, and will see
that the offenders are prosecuted.
He said It was impossible for
the association to deal with the
drivers who were operating with
out a tag and who were not mem
bers of the association.
Considerable pressure has been
brought against the police, It is
said, by outside Interests to ar
rest all drivers who are charging
the excess rate.
I CATHEDRAL WRECKED BY STORM
A view of the interior of the wrecked St. James' cathedral (Cathoil< ) nt Seattle, showing, at
the top, the yawning hole in (lie roof where the dome fell in late Wednesday, und the debris piled
high in the auditorium. The great pipe organ sli ows in the background. The collapse is blamed to
the snow which had piled deep on the roof nnd to a fault In a steel girder. The damage may amount
to aa much as 973,000, and will require three months to repair.
The fact that the sudden air pressure developed inside the building when the dome fell blew out
the windows Is thought to have saved the walls fr on weakening.
The cathedral is tbe large, light-colored edifice with twin towers which forms so conspicuous a
feature of the Seattle sky-line as seen from the harbor.
