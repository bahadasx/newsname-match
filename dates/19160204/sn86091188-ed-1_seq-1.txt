FULL WEEK IN GOING
SALT LAKE TO BUTTE
One train on the Short Line,
Known as No. 0, made a record last
week fur lack of speed. It left Salt
Lake on Tuesday, January 16,
reached Pocatello the same evening
and struck the blizzards and drifts
near Dubois the same night, where it
remained fast ti'.i the following Tues
day, January 28, wiien it pulled in
to Butte. The slowness of progress
was due entirely to the conditions of
weather which no forces ^could over
come.
On Friday, January 28, the coldest
temperature reported on the Short
Line system was in that district,
where thermometers went to 45 be
low. High winds, blowing a gale of
thirty miles per hour, with weither
rauging from twenty to forty de
grees below zero, marked the entire
day. The weather was such that a
human being could not stand to be
out of doors, let alone work. The
combination of wind and cold delay
ed all trains, but by the liberal use
of snow shovels and snow plows, all
passengers were put through al
though it is an impossibility to make
schedule time.
At midnight Friday night, Janu
ary 28, I ho rotary which was broken
in a head-on collision with a freight
j
train at Monlda, was sent to Dubois. ,
The rotary had been in the shops,
and was again in first class condition
when it left Pocatello.
According to official announcement
trains over the northern brancii will
be late so long as the present un
precedented combination of blizzards
and cold wea»uer continues.

LARGE SUGAR BEET ACREAGE
Sugar beet acreage in Ctah and
Idaho is expfO'ed to be increased this
year nrore than 29,000, and it is pre
dieted that tire output of the factor
ies of tha Utah-Idaho Sugar company
and the Amalgamated Sugar com
pany will require the building of ad
ditlons to the older factories. The
land cultivated last season for the
sugar beet companies of Utah a°d
Idaho totaled 61,000 acres. The
farmers expect to plant more than
80,000 acres of beets this year and the
two companies have contracted for
almost this acreage. In addition sev
eral thousand acres will be signed up
by the companies as experimental
sugai beet land. The Increase in
Idaho in the acreage devoted to sugar
beets has been caused by the wheat
farmers devoting their fields to beets,
in the rotation of crops.

By J. £. CROOK
Dear Editor 1 will greatly ap
preciate the publication of this news
ietm, and am sure that many of your
readers will tie Interested in the
progress that has been made by the
Adventist church.
r
Great enthusiasm was manifested
among 1 >cal Seventh-day Adventists
when they harried of the unusual
progress made by their denomination
during tiie past year, as given in a
report that lias Just been received
from the world's headquarters of the
church In Washington, D. C. Ex -1
tracts of this report, compiled by H.
E. Rogers, statistical secretary of the
denomination, having been sent
broadcast Ihrougout North America,
j in order that the believers might

vauced.
One of the remarkable statement«
in the report 1«, that "The actual
net gain in memfiefship for the year
was greater than the entire mem
bershiD of the denomination through
out the world as it stood thirty years ;
after this movement had begun its j
work." j
The report says further: !
"At the lose of 1914, the total :
membership was 125.844, a galr dur
ing the year of 11,2 M 7, or 9.85 per i
cent. The gain for 1913 was 8,100, i
or 7.16 per cent, and that was the !
large«! gain ever recorded up to that !
time. The gain for 1914 was great,
,, r than hat reported for tiie preced
,ng year by 3,107. Tiie number ol
baptisms during the year wan 14,999.

During Long

A message received from Gilmore
this morning by Manager Shaw of
