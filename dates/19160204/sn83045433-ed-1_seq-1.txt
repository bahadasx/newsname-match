g?pori News, Va., Feb. 3.?
The passengers and crew of the
Rritish steamer Appam, captured
by the German commerce raider
.Moewe, were landed here today.
\Vith them came ashore the cap
tains and crews of seven other
British vessels which had been
sunk by the Moewe.
Th? prisoners on the Appam
were released by Lieut Berge, in
command of the German prize
rrew. on demand of the I'nited |
States government. The following
order was handed Lieut. Berge by
Collector of Customs Norman R.
I lamilton :
"Von will release from the ?
steamship Appam alt those persons '
who desire to be released, and who ?
came in on the strip, except the !
prize officer and prize crew or maj \
who acted as a part of said prize
rrew in the navigation of the ship." ?

About ?wl persons nuit th?? i?htp ami
????r? brought ashore her??. Some twiaity
(Vrmans. priaonera on the Appam. who
had been releas??!*! by the prize crew,
elected to remain aboard. Amone them
were three women.
Hejolee Oliar Releaae.
The dial-eraba rcat ion was ?.'Mined out
with Jubilation and rejoicing by l!;e pas
sengers and Britisli craws. No happier
part? ever came down a gangway. The
Britons fraternized in the local hotels and
bars until they took ?hip for Norfolk,
where many later board?*! coastwise
eteamers and took tialns for New York
and Washington.
At the last moment a sharp controversy
took p,aa-p. and it appeareij for a time
that Capi. Harrison, former commander
of the Appam. and his crew of 18 might
remain aboard. He received orders from
the Elder-Dempster line. British owner?
of the Appam. not to leave the ship. The
British Embassy, ln the meantime, ordered
all the English aboard to get off as soon
a? Lteajt. Berg would let them.
The action of the Elder-Dempster
laine apparently waa taken ln .support
of their claim that the ahip Is their
property. They hold that the Ger
mana forfeited claim to the Appam
by bringing her into a neutral port
and remaining ln neutral waters.
Five members of the crew of tne
sunken Clan McTavish. who were
picked up by the Appam. were taken
to a hospital. They are suffering
from wounds received In the engage
ment between the Clan McTavlsh and
the Moewe.

SpeeUl Cabi? to Tha WulniHn BcraliL
reri?. Fei?. *!.?Tlie time has come
? Rain for tht allies tu "took around and
see how they stand. Three vital points
in the present problem are:
What about the trench war?
What about the war of attrition?
What la the diplomatic situation?
The trench war seems stationary, but
the people must not be deceived. On
both sides tremendous preparations are
being made tor a gigantic battle, which
cannot be long delayed.
The central empires, surrounded with
an almost complete clrcumvallation,
nave only two ways of breaking
through the Iron ring?either by pierc
ing it st a decisive point or by obtain
ing a deciaion on a far-off battlefield,
such as Kgypt or Mesopotunia.
Might End War.
Th?* latter solution does not offer im
mediate danger. The Teutons are dally
trying to pierce the wwtern front.
It la very doubtful whether they poa
moaa the strength to carry ?hi-nngh a
huge attack successfully. Nevertheless,
there i? one great factor ln their favor
?they have a tremendously powerful
heavy artillery.
This artillery can not only prepare a
great attack, but lt Is dally killing allied
Hoops. That Is how the Germans are
now nibbling at our front.
For thi? reason I think the day 1? not
far distant when a fearfur hand-to-hand
battle will be engaged in which will end
trench warfare.
Our leaders are aware of this possibility.
We can be ?certain th**y alwaya have it in
mind. ?\t the last Champagne battle our
people living at Ardennes and on the
Aisne witnessed preparations for a great
retreat by Germans, over whom had
.?wept the breath of rout.
Tentons Trying Hard.
? bigger aod longer sustained battle
probably will end trench warfare and the
war it?self. for Germany lies at the mercy
of one terrific, well-delivered blow.
Regarding the war of attrition, we must
not be deluded. Despite their undoubted
sufferings, tbe German people are not In
a tottering condition. The militairlst.
agrarian, and Intellectual parties still
hold their heads high.
But the allies can aggravate the evils
of food and money shortage by tightening
the blockade.
The trainine of our armies is magnifi
cent, and their equipment waa consider
ably improved. It remains for us to oom
bine trench warfare, the war of attrition
and vigorous, united diplomatic action to
win a definitive victory.

If possible, views upon which peace pro
poaals might be based, was made In
formally to Secretary of State Lansing
by Count von Bernstorff, the German Am
bassador to the United States, accord
ing to the informant of the International
News Service.
Peace Kmlaaarlea Active.
There Is no good reason to doubt that
the German peace propaganda has been
extended to the United States, for It la
an open secret thAt peace emissaries of
?Germany have been active ln several of
the neutral countries of Europe during
the past alx months
Count Von BernstonTs suggestion that
an envoy be sent abroad to look into the
poeait'llitlea for peace was convoyed to
Pt-asldent Wilson by 8a?cretary Lansing.
The . ???Id???, seeing a possible Chan u
for a service to humanity, decided to act,
be the outcome what it might. Accord
ingly. CoL Houae. the confidant of the
President, was summoned to the White
House and a long conference waa held.
Col. House accepted the mission ana
Immediately the United Statea embassies
In London, Berlin and Paris were en
trusted with the task of arranging con
ference? with the various foreign min
isters and other Influential membera of
the government.
Old Vnl See Ambassador.
It is believed that CoL House did not
sec Ambassador iron Bernstorff before
his departure for Europe on December
-X last, but that all arrangements were
made through Secretary l-ansing
Count von Bernstorff was given per
mission to uae the private channels of
the United States State Department, ano
the information was thus transmitt??d to
Dr. Von Jagow. the Gasrman foreign
minister, and a reply was received ln
the -ame manner.
Immediately afterward the news was
given out in Washington that Col. House
waa going abroad on an "unofficial'' mis
sion connected with problema affecting
American embassies.
It Is believed In London that Col.
House's mission will end ln failure. The
allies are bound to stand together, ana
have pledged themselves not to consider
peace until an absolute victory is In
sight.
