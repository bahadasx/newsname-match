FRESIDENT ELS AEONS FOR IVEPBIESS
DELIVERS SNIUES OK SPEECHES THROUGHOUT MIDDLE WEST,
DECLARING "NO MAN KNOWS WHAT A SINGLE HOUR MAY BRING
FORTH"—INCREASED MILITARY STRENGTH TO BE USED FOR
DEFENSE, NOT AGGRESSION.
Carrying his program of prepared
ness direct to the people, President
Woodrow Wilson delivered a series
of speeches in various cities of the
Middle West the latter part of last
week and the fore part of this,
speeches in which, speaking as he
said "solemnly," he warned the na
tion that the time may come when
he cannot keep the United States out
of war and maintain its honor, and
declared that the nation must be pre
pared to defend itself and be pre
pared at once.
"Let me tell you very solemnly,
you cannot afford to postpone this
thing," he told some 4,000 persons
who heard him Saturday night in
Cleveland, Ohio. "I do not know
what the next day will bring. I do
not mean to point to any particular
danger. I merely tell you we are
daily treading amongst intricate
dangers. We are being swept along
by things not of our making and over
which we have no control. No man
in the United States knows what a
single week, a single day, a single
hour may bring forth.
"You may count 011 me to keep
you out of war," he added pointedly,
"but you must help me in maintain
ing the honor of the nation."
Sincerity Impresses Audiences.
This series of speeches has been
the most stirring the president has
delivered during his official career,
and the evident sincerity, earnest
ness and solemnity with which he
clothed his statements were singu
larly impressive. In all of his speech
es he emphasized the possibility that
the United States may be drawn into
the European struggle as the reason
why he believes the navy and army
should be strengthened without de
lay; in all of the cities in which he
spoke he was greeted with large
crowds and great enthusiasm, and
his demands as to preparedness re
ceived warm responses from his au
diences.
Again and again in his different
•peeches he spoke of the nation's
honor. In his Cleveland address he
declared the real man believes his
honor is dearer than his life, and- a
nation's honor dearer than its peace
and comfort. It had been difficult,
he said, to keep the United States
out of the war, adding, "I hope you
"will bear me out in saying I have
proved that I am a partisan of
peace."
"America is not afraid of any
body," he said. "I know I reflect
your feeling and the feeling of all of
our citizens when I say that the only
thing I am afraid of Is not being
ready to perform my duty. I am
afraid of the danger of shame. lam
afraid of the danger of inadequacy;
I am afraid of the danger of not
being able to express the correct
character of this country with tre
mendous might and effectiveness
•whenever we are called upon to act
in the field of the world's affairs.
"I would be ashamed to be bellig
erent and impatient when the for
tunes of my whole country and the
happiness of all niy fellow country
men were involved. But I know that
peace is not always within the choice
of the nation, and I want to remind
—and remind you very solemnly—of
the double obligation you have laid
upon me. I know you have laid it
upon me, because I am constantly re
minded of it in conversation, by let
ter, in editorial, by means of every
voice that writes me out of the body
of the nation. You have laid upon
me this double obligation: 'We are
relying upon you, Mr. Preisdent, to
keep us out of this war, but we are
relying upon you, Mr. President, to
keep the honor of the nation un
stained.'
May Be Unable to Do Both.
"Do you not see that a time may
come when it is impossible to do both
of these things? Do you not see that
If I am to guard the honor of the
nation, I am not protecting it againßt
itself, for we are not going to do any
thing to stain the honor of our own
country? I am protecting it against
things that I cannot control —the ac
tion of others. And where the ac
tions of others may bring us, I can
not foretell. You may count upon
my heart and resolution to keep you
out of the war, but you must be

ready if it is necessary that I should
maintain your honor."
Regret that the question has come
up in a campaign year was expressed
by Mr. Wilson. "Let us forget," he
said, "that this is a year of national
elections." The preparedness issue,
he said, should have nothing to do
with politics. "The man who seeks
partisan value from these questions
is unworthy of your confidence," he
declared. The president asserted it
was the duty of all men of all parties
to think and do the same thing and
forget party differences at such a
time.
"And in the first place all should
tell the truth," he declared. "Some
tell you that we have no defense and
others say we have sufficient defense.
Neither tell the truth. Take for In
stance, our coast defenses. Their
quality is admirable, but their quan
tity is insufficient. As to our navy,
some say it ranks second to any navy
in the world. Our navy ranks fourth,
and we should do everything to bring
it up to adequate strength and effi
ciency.

N. P:S NEW DEPOT MAY
8E ERECTED THIS YEAR
Construction of SSO.OOO Building De
pends on Capitol Commis
sion's Plans.
Delayed in its plans for the last
two years by the capitol commission
which for lack of funds was unable
to carry out some of its ideas, the
Northern Pacific will construct a new
$50,000 depot on its property at Sev
enth and Columbia streets this year,
if the supreme court upholds the cap
itol bond issue, enabling the com
mission and the railroad to reach an
agreement as to plans.
This is the unofficial report current
in local circles this week, authenti
cated by the fact that two years ago
the railroad made provision in its
budget for a new depot here, appro
priating $50,000 for the purpose, and
prepared plans for the building and
the re-arrangement of its yards, only
to hold them up temporarily at the
request of the capitol commission.
The sale of the capitol bonds and the
likelihood that their validity will be
upheld in the test suit to be argued
before the supreme court Friday,
have revived the railroad's plans as
to the construction of a new depot
here.
The company had planned to re
arrange its yards and to erect a new
depot at the same time as the con
crete tunnel under Seventh street
was constructed, but Was delayed as
stated, because of yard changes the
capitol commission desires made and
upon which it waß not then in a po
sition to talk business. When the
re-arrangement is undertaken, the
depot will probably be built on the
west side of the railroad line, and
the route of the railroad straight
ened so that instead of curving
around under capitol hill it will run
directly across the bay.
COUNTY DROPS GAME FAHM.
Imogen SI,OOO in a Year ami Then Lets
Go to H. W. Myers.
After having been operated for the
past year at a loss of SI,OOO, the
county game farm at Butler s Cove
was taken over this week by H. W.
Myers, who has been in charge of it
for the past year, after having orig
inally sold it to the county.
I Details of the transfer are not
made public, except that Myers is to
pay for the farm with birds sold to
'the county. The farm was estab
lished by the game commission and
'maintained out of moneys received
'by the county from hunters' licenses
' and from fines assessed for violations

HARBOR LEASE HELD UP.
Mayor Opposes Granting W'wton's
Application for Part of City Tract.
Opposition by Mayor Geo. A. Mott
man to the sub-leasing by the city of
a part of its harbor tract to Arthur
Weston, who wants to make exten
sive improvements on it to permit the
operation of a car ferry between
Olympia and Shelton, resulted in the
appointment of a special committee
to confer with the state land com
missioner, after a considerable de
bate at the council meeting Tuesday
night.
The proposal to grant Weston a
lease was reported favorably by the
public property committee, but the
mayor opposed the sub-lease on the
ground that the city would need the
property for another city dock with
in five years. Councilmen who fa
vored the proposition, however,
pointed out that only half of the
property is to be sub-leased and that
the city still retains right to a tract
with 150-foot frontage on the harbor,
and expressed the opinion that this
would be plenty large enough for the
city's purposes. They also argued
that the city should encourage the
establishment of an enterprise such
as Weston proposes.
N. P. DAIRY MEETING
SATURDAY AFTERNOON
EXPERTS TO TALK ON ALL
PHASES OF SUBJECT—GEN
ERAL DISCUSSION.
Special invitations are being Bent
by the Thurston County Dairymen's
association to every farmer whose
name appears on the list of patrons
of local creameries, urging them to
attend the big dairy meeting at the
Chamber of Commerce at 1:30 Sat
urday afternoon under the direction
of the Northern Pacific, one of a se
ries of meetings it is conducting
throughout Southwest Washington in
its campaign for "More and Better
Livestock." While particularly urg
ing those directly engaged in the
dairy business, the association and
the Northern Pacific are also anxious
that every farmer who can, attend
Saturday's meeting.
Talks will be made by Professor
D. E. ("Farmer") Willard, the
Northern Pacific expert, C. E. Arney,
western immigration agent, and the
representative of the Pullman State
College who is traveling with the
party, and after these the meeting
will be thrown open to general dis
cussion, when the farmers will be
expected to ask any questions they
may desire about different features
of the dairy business.
In the general discussion of dairy
ing, such subjects as dairy cows, cow
testing, f&rm feeds, silos, care of milk
and cream, use of by-products, mar
keting problems, and methods of
farming, including the clearing of
logged-oft lands, will be considered,
while an important feature of the
meeting will be consideration of the
financing question, ways in which
loans at a satisfactory rate of inter
est can be granted farmers for the
purchase of dairy cattle. The meet
ing will occupy most of the after
noon, and business men of Olympia
as well as farmers of the county will
be urged to attend.
! The first meeting in the campaign
in this county was held at Yelm Mon
day afternoon, and in spite of the
snowstorm and inclement weather,
bad road conditions and everything
else, a large crowd of farmers gath
ered, the railroad officials reported,
and the meeting lasted for more than
two hours. The farmers were en
thusiastic, asked lots of questions
and were very much interested, and
I the success of this meeting leads the
railroad officials to believe that the
meeting at the Chamber of Com
merce Saturday will be a large one.
Meeting Is Postponed.
1 Attorney P. M. Troy, Democratic
state committeeman for this county,
received a telegram Wednesday from
State Chairman J. B. Fogarty of Ev

of the state central committee which
was to have been held in Everett
Saturday had been postponed for two

RELIEF FROM SNOW
WILL SOON RE HERE
INDIANS PREDICT "CHINOOK"—
WEEK SEES HEAVIEST SNOW
IN YEARS.
Basing bis prediction on the new
mooji Thursday and the "hunches"
of the Indians, the local weatherman
promises relief in the next day or two
from the heavy snow—the heaviest
Western Washington has known since
188^ —when the "chinook" winds
come, more than likely carrying with
them a downpour of rain. that will
make the sidewalks and streets of
the city seas of slush and the county
roads lakes of mud. The Indians are
the ones who see the warm winds
coming local weather observers,
even the old-timers, so often mistaken
this winter, have quit guessing what's
going to happen next, but this is the
Indians' "big moon," and with it,
they say, always comes the "chinook."
Relief will be welcomed by every
one in the city and country. Thirty
six years from now "old-timers" will
point back to the "big snow of 1916"
as today they are pointing back to
1880 or still further to the severe
cold spell of '6l, that lasted three
months. With the coming of the
"chinook" are also expected heavy
floods, streets and roads as full of
water and slush and muck as they
are now with snow, railroads tied up
with slides and washouts as they are
now with snow. But the "chinook"
will liberate business once more, will
permit logging camps to resume and
lumber mills to start again, in what
lumbermen say will be the biggest
boom in recent years because of the
enforced shut-down of the last six
weeks when hardly one-fifth of the
normal cut was made, and the in
creased demand at better prices.
16 Inched of Know This Week.
Olympia's streets Thursday were
piled waist-high with snow, roofs
were heavily burdened, sidewalks la
boriously cleared; Thurston county
roads, even the best of them, were
well-nigh impassable and some were
entirely closed. In the storm that
began Monday and ended Wednesday
night, 16 inches of snow fell, accord
ing to Weather Observer Raymond
Holcomb of the state department of
agriculture, bringing the total snow
fall since the last day of December up
to 31% inches, the deepest snow and
the longest duration—3s days—in
the 20 years that records have been
kept in the local office.
The week's snowstorm started in
Monday, the snow falling steadily all
day and being whipped into a bliz
zard by the strong wind toward even
ing. All Monday night and part of
Tuesday it snowed, but that after
noon the wind veered to the south, a
"chinook" set in and it rained stead
ily the rest of the day and through
the night until early Wednesday
morning, when the wind re-shifted
to the north and the heaviest snow of
the season was recorded, 10 inches
during the day.
All traffic was demoralized, though

MONY—DEFENDANT TESTIFIES IN OWN BEHALF, DENYING
EVERY FEATURE OF STONE'S CONFESSION—DEFENSE INTRO
DUCES EVIDENCE TO SHOW ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES IN
OTHER CLAIMS AND LOOSE METHODS USED BY DEPARTMENT.
After six hours of arguments by
opposing counsel, the case involving
J. F. Gillies, deposed claim agent, in
the industrial insurance frauds went
to the jury about 6 o'clock Thursday
evening, after a trial that lacked but
two days of occupying three weeks'
time and brought to Olympia an
array of witnesses from all parts of
the state. It is estimated the trial
will have cost at least (5,000, a large
part of which will be charged to
Thuraton county.
The taking of testimony was com
pleted Wednesday afternoon, the
court's Instructions were delivered
by Superior Judge John R, Mitchell
when the trial was resumed Thurs
day morning, and at 10:30 Assistant
Attorney General John M. Wilson
began the opening argument for the

CLUB WANTS SAMPLES OF
LOCAL SPUOS FOR SEED
Also Desires to Know How Many
Acres of Potatoes Will Be Plant
ed Here This Year.
Decision to use local seed potatoes
this year and to treat them with
chemicals If necessary to eradicate
any disease, was taken at the regular
meeting of the Thurston County Po
tato club at the Chamber of Com
merce last Saturday, when, though
there was a good attendance in spite
of the inclement weather, the club
voted to postpone permanent organi
zation until Saturday afternoon, Feb
ruary 12, when it is hoped that the
weather will be such that more farm
ers can attend.
I At the next meeting the club wants
all those farmers who have white
seed potatoes for sale to bring sam
ples of them and also samples of the
soil in which they were grown, so
that the club can determine the best
varieties to plant in the different
soils throughout the county and can
buy the proper seed from those farm
ers who have it for sale. Samples of
the soil are as essential as samples
of seed, according to the announce
ment made by Dr. P. H. Carlyon, or
ganizer of the club. '
At the meeting February 12 the
club also wants to know what farm
ers are going to plant potatoes this
year and how many acres they ex
pect to plant, so that it can have ac
curate Information as to the acreage
it can depend on for this year's crop
and make the required arrangements
for marketing It. The club wants to
include in its marketing plan all the
acreage it can get, so that it can
standardize and grade the crop and
offer buyers sufficient of any particu
lar variety to make carload ship
ments.
Officers will be elected at this meet
ing and the permanent organization
effected, and for all these reasons the
club hopes for a big attendance.

part of Wednesday were occupied by
the defense in presenting its testi
mony, the feature of which, besides
the attempts to "show up" the
alleged lax methods employed in the
office, was the testimony of Gillies
himself, in which he emphatically
denied every feature of the evidence
of his alleged accomplice and partner
In the fishing business, Frank Stone,
who confessed last week. Gilliea
denied any guilty knowledge of the
fraudulent claims, asserted he had so
much work to do as claim agent that
he had no time to investigate as to
the legality of claims and took them
at their face value, and attempted to
explain large bank deposits at about
the same time fraudulent warrants
were cashed by stating he had made
sl,Bso in oil stock speculation and
had been entrusted with $1,200 as a
trust fund by A. B. Ernst, one of the
industrial Insurance commissioner*,
which Ernst later emphatically de
nied. Gillies' bank deposits during
several months last spring totaled
$5,000 and be testified he also kept
some money in a safe deposit vault.
His salary as claim agent was SISO
a month.
Gillies Contradicts Stone.
Friday afternoon, Saturday and
Monday the defense occupied by the
introduction of some 2,000 claimß in
which various irregularities were at
tempted to be shown, and Gllllea
took the stand Tuesday, his direct
examination occupied the entire day.
He told a radically different story
from that told by Frank Stone, con
fessed forger of the spurious claims.
In every particular Gillies contradict
ed Stone's testimony, stating that he
had no knowledge of the claims be
ing spurious when he allowed them
to pass through the office with his
"O. K."; that the claims in question
were not forged by Stone at his dic
tation nor under his direction; that
he did not hand the vouchers to Btone
for the latter's signature, and that
he did not deliver the warrants issued
on the claims to Stone. He also de
nied getting any money from Stone
as the result of cashing bogus war
rants, and said he never hired Stone
to do any writing for him. Gillies'
story is not corroborated by other
witnesses, however.
Gillies admitted being engaged in
the fishing business with Stone, and
having loaned him money at odd
times, |1,730 all told.
How Gillies was able to deposit
nearly $5,000 between February and
September of 1915, was then brought
out. Gillies said he received $1,420
from Stone in repayment of loans
and his share of the profits of the
fishing business; $1,860 as a result
of Investments in oil stock with a
man named Will White; $l2O as a
result of collecting former small
loans from various persons, and that
he received $1,200 from Commis
sioner Ernst to be deposited as a sort
of trust fund.
He also said he had $650 in a safe
deposit vault, which he transferred
to his account at the bank.
"1 received $1,200 from another
person; it was not my money," Gil
lies testified. t
"Was this money paid to you on
account of any dealings with indus
trial insurance claims?" Attorney
Vance aßked.
"No, it was not."
"Who was this other person?"
"A. B. Ernst."
"Was this money paid as a result
of a private business affair?"
"Yeß. It was given to me as a sort
of a trust fund. I deposited it, and
paid out the money in various sums
as orders or demands came to me."
Ernst Makes Flat Denial.
After Gillies' cross-examination
Wednesday, the state submitted as
rebuttal evidence to this particular
transaction the testimony of Com
missioner Ernst, who emphatically
denied ever having given Gillies
money to be held in trust.
"Did you give Gillies any money
whatsoever to be handled in trust for
you between February and Septem
ber of 1915?" Mr. Ernst was asked.
"Not a cent," was the reply.
Commissioner Ernst testified that
