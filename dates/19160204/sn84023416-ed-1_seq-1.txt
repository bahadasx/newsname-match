just the same. It's "up to us" to see that you have
the proper tools with which to do it. In the matter of
Washing Machines, we have the American at $5.00, the
Horton Rotary Washer at $8.00 and the Water Motor Wash

boiler with the clothes packed about it which "works while
you sleep," the price is $1.75. You may have this on trial,
or in fact, any of them. If they do not do the work it's no
sale. Of course we have a variety of Mop and .Clothes
Wringers, Wash Boards, Sad Irons, and all the needful helps.

The Pennies in the Box.
I'm Uncle Sam's most favored pet,
I'm hearty and I'm hale;
I've nothing in this world to do
But glide 'round with the mail
But one thing! almost breaks my
heart
And my nervous system shocks.
It's the everlasting pennies .
That I'm fishing from the box.
I carry stamps and envelopes '
And postal cards and such;
And I would like to sell a few
'Twonld please me very much.
But a man can't sell unless you buy,
No matter how he talks;
So I have to keep on diving
After the pennies in the box.
It's all right in the springtime
Or when summer breezes blow,
But a different proposition
When it's thirty-two below;
When all your fingers and your
Are frozen hard as rocks,
It's most anything but funny
Scratching pennies from the
toes
box
And now, quite confidentially,
I'll tell you something more,
A rural carrier fway out West)
Forgot himself and swore;
Says he, "I can stand the snowdrifts
I can stand the frozen locks,
But blast the mfeasley pennies
In the blastedj measley box."
When the roll is called up yonder
And we all shall gather there,
They wouldn't let a mail man in
If they knew lie'd learned to swear
If you want St Peter to open the
gate !
When your rural carrier knocks,
Buy stamps; -and don't be guilty
Of putting pennies in the box.
