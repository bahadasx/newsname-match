One Time Member of House
Naval Committee, Now Here,
' Favors Big Fleet for Hawaii
"President Wilson's plan to make
tire nary of the United States the
most powerful in the world will have
the aupport of the mainland voter,
almost to a man, hut the plan for a
large standing army will te opposed.
nd probably defeated, by the inland
states the 'great -Middle West."
That is the opinion cf Harvey C.
Garber of Columbus, Ohio, former
congressman from: that state who,
with Chris E. Markey of Los Angeles,
is now visiting in Honolulu. Mr. Gar
ber returns to the mainland in the
Matsonla next week, but Mr. Markey
may locate here. Mr. Markey was
v Mr. Garber's private secretary when
the latter war In Congress.
"People of the interior states do not
favor a large standing army," contin
ued Mr." Garber, "though they see the
need of a powerful navy.-y .
For my own part I approve a great
strengthening of the defenses of Oahu,
Porto Rico and all our other islands,
except the Philippines, and a great in
crease In coast defenses on the Atlan

"The Philippines, I think, we should
relinquish at an early date. We do
not want to keep them, and la the
event of war e wtould Inevitably Jose
'them, for they 'are too far from our

"For my part I would not be averse
to seeing Japan control those islands,
. cf at least, direct their policy, 4ecause
they are contiguous to Japan on the

are like those of any other nation.
"We undoubtedly heed a mucb lar

Uhe wealthy Middle West, which fur
' ; niches much of the wealth of the na

is opposed to an adequate force. v
"In my mind that Is another argu

think It would be wise, to bring all
of the army now in those Islands to
this territory, thereby greatly increas

Regiment on Each Island. ',
"I ahould also favor having at least
one regiment of ..regulars on. each of
the other islands of this group. A big
Increase of your coast defenses here
also is essential, as Is a powerful unit
of the navy. In order to keep you from
possible hostile attack."

DOUBLE TRACKS
SURE THIS YEAR
Ballentyne Tells City Engineer
That Directors Have Au
thorized Improvement
King street will be double tracked
by tha Honolulu Rapid Transit and
Land Company some time this year.
News of a resolution of the board
of directors of the transit company
to this effect tame out in a statement
made by City Engineer Collins at last
night's meeting . of the board of su
pervisors. The matter came up in
connectiou with the proposed narrow
ing of Beretania street. A letter from
C. G. Ballentyne, manager of the trac
tion company,. to City Engineer Col
lines was - Incorporated in the en
gineer's report on the matter. In the
letter it was stated that the work has
already been authorized by the direct
ors and would be commenced some
time during the present year.
As a consequence of this additional
tracking a great amount of traffic
will be diverted from King street to
Beretania street, especially' when the
latter Is paved. Is the engineer's con
clusion. Labeled "Poor Economy"
The saving in cost of paving to be
effected by moving the curbs would
be only about $8000" and this was de
clared by the engineer to be poor
economy.
A traffic study by Fred Ohrt. as
sistant city engineer, shows that 62
per cent of the traffic on King street.
Ewa of the junction, continued out the
same road and but 32 per cent turned
down Kalakaua avenue.
His report on the situation declares
that when King street is double-tracked
the clearance between the street
car running boards and the curb will
be such that owners of machines driv
ing to and from town could not pass
a standing street car and comply with
the traffic ordinance requiring a
clearance of eight feet. This would
mean that a great part of the traffic
would be diverted to Beretania street
as soon as it is put In condition.
