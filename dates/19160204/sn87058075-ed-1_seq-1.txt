VOL. LVII. NO. 24 CRESCO, HOWARD COUNTY, IOWA, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 4, 1916
w*m
A Fine Entertainment.
While a goodly portion of the audi
ence that went to the opera house last
Friday evening did it more from'a sense
of loyalty to the school then with the
expectation of hearing some real music,
such were most agreeably surprised to
find that they were being treated to an
operetta full of real tuneful numbers
and catchey choruses.
John Patterson was cast for the lead
ing role, and, although it was his first
appearance before the public as a
vocalist, he carried the part with ease
and sang with a precision and correct
ness that showed his ability as a
musician. He has a good voice for a
young boy and gives promise of mak
ing a good tenor singer in later years.
Elizabeth Kakac, Grace Patterson,
Charlotte Melvold and Mildred Klingle
sustained other leading parts, singing
their parts nicely. The hit of the even
ing was the duet "Nothing To Do," a
delightful bit of nensense sang by
Herold Wilbur and John Patterson.
Charlie Tillson acquitted himself cred
itably in a rather difficult duet with
Charlotte Melvold, and Willard Todd
surprisedall with .his singing, especially
in his rendering of "In Dreamland,"
which should have been given a rous
ing encore, for it was worthy of one.
The chorus did excellent work, sing
ing with such volume and precision as
is seldom heard from young amateurs.
Miss Hughes, the instructor in music
in the schools, is deserving of much
credit for her success in successfully
training the young singers and so
prettily staging the production.
Before the performance and between
the acts, the High School Orchestra
rendered several pleasing selections.

Two years ago he was compelled to
give up farming on account of failing
health. Wednesday, Jan. 26th, he was
called away, leaving his wife, one son,
two daughters, two grandchildren and
one brother, Albert Henke. The fune
ral was held at Immanuel's Lutheran
Church Saturday noon, Rev. J. Pless
officiating. Deceased was laid to rest
in Howard Center cemetery.
A precious one from us has gone,
A voice we loved is stilled,
A place is vacant in our home
That never can be filled
All is dark within our dwelling,
Lonely are our hearts today,
For the one we loved so dearly
Has forever passed away.
CARD OP THANKS.
We wish to give our heartfelt thanks
to our kind friends and neighbors who
so kindly assisted us at the time of the
illness, death and burial of our loving
husband and father, and also for the
beautiful flowers.

The children have been working hard

points toward some good work by
them.

Opera Howe Stockholders Meet.
At the annual meeting of the
1S«V week* Secretary
W. H. Tillson made a report of the

A Rural Reate
One of the Cresco carriers who has
been compelled to frequently remove
his mittens daring the past cetd weath
er and nearly freeze his fingers trying
to fish an elusive letter or postal card
from a mail box offers the suggestion,
that if the letters and cards were
placed in an ordinary clothes pin, they
could be removed from the box much
more easily. The idea is endorsed by
the other carriers. Try it out. The
carriers declare that it is no scheme to
supply themselves with clothes pins at
the public expense, but that all clothes
pins will be left in the boxes as a mark
of appreciation for the thoughtfulness
of their patrons.
On Monday evening of this week,
Rural Carrier Win. G. Fish and his
horse "Old Snip" completed 14 years
of faithful service a* carrier on Route
3. Mr. Fish estimates that during this
time the old horse has traveled 60,000
miles.

A basket social will be given at the
