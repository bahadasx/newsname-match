FROM THE PEOPLE.
) To the Editor of The Beacon.
? I am enclosing you a clipping
, containing part of an address,
delivered by Hon. J. J. Brown,
president of the Farmers Union
of Georgia. Would that I had
the power to convert the Heavens
above us, into a mighty scroll,
written there on, in letters of liv
ing fire, these eternal truths
that they might burn themselves
into the minds and thoughts of
man.
Arousing them to a realization
of the true condition that con
fronts the American farmer, and
working man of today. The ad
dress follows below. Read it:
"Civis."
For ten years the Farmers'
Union has stood for and recom
mended to its members diversi
fied farming, the growing of
home supplies, raising cattle and
hogs, in fact, we. have taught
this lesson so thoroughly, that it
is presumptious for anyone to
suggest these means as any com
plete solution of our "agricultural
problems. It is a fact that the
Union, in co-operation with our
extension and demonstration
agencies of this state, has taught
our faiiners to grow not only two
blades where one was. formerly
grown, but in many cases more
than twenty have been produced
where the one formerly grew;
and yet we find the farmers of
our state, as a whole, more
heavily in debt than they were
five years ago. So, my friends,
while it is safe farming to follow
these teachings, it is not appar
ent that we will ever be able to
redeem the mortgages that hang
over our, homes until we devise
some plan by which we will be
able to demand a margin of profit
cn these extra blades t aad extra
bushels. We may learn from a
scientific application how, to grow
100 times what we now raise per
acre, but if we sell the increase
for less than it costs us to pro
duce it there is no gain to the
Eroducer; . nor, on the other
and, do we find the laborers in
the shops and in the mills living
in any more ease and -luxury
than before we began our system
of diversification. But those of
us who have been close students
on the farm for the past few
years, have observed that this
extra increase of wealth is going
into the hands of the gaffi biers
and the manipulators who con
trol the money of our country
and in turn control the prices of
our products. And let it be un
derstood here that when we re
fer to these manipulators who
say from the farm that wealth
which should go to the producer
and legitimate consumer, we do
not mean the Then who are en
gaged in legitimate mercantile,
and manusacturing industries.
The Farmers' Union has no war
to make on our merchants and
others engaged in facilitating
our commerce. We have always
had merchants and will ever
have them, for the fact that they
are essential in a great agricul
tural and commercial country.
One of our greatest handicaps as
a farm organization has been due
to the misunderstanding that
existed on the part of our mer
chants and country brnks rela
tive to our oims and purpose,
but I am glad to say to you today
that these misunderstandings
are fast passing away and thanks
be to those who have stood faith
fully by our great Union, your
labors have not been in vain.
The Union is growing more pow
erful tSan ever before, and the
business interests have at last
seen the necessity of co-operation
all along the line in order that
our great section may receive
her proportionate part of the
wealth that she produces. It has
begun to dawn on our would-be
friends, who once advised ue
that we had no jJace in the po
litical arena, tnat the opposite is
absolutely true. While we pro
nose to continue along the line oi
safe farming, giving the aid of
the Union to every agnculturai
institution in our state that will
co-operate with us, we intend to
go farther and demand of oui
law makers, both state . and na
tional that they give to us, as
the wealth of this country, out
fair share of the wealth produced
through laws that are just and
equitable.
The farmers of this country
have done more to change the
course of humanity from barbar
ism to civilization than any oth
er class. They have, furnished
the raw material to make the
raiment for the civilized world
and food for all mankind. Every
ounce of food is a witness to their
power and every yard of cloth
tells of their work. Their indus
try is the foundation of com
merce. The manufacturers' suc
cess and the bankers' security is
based on their products. The
trains on our mighty railways and
the ships of the sea rush to the
hungry multituies the food to
feed them, and yet the farmers
are getting behind in the proces
sion. For at the beginning of
our existence as a nation 90 per
cent of our wealth was in the pos
session of rural population." In
1860 the total wealth of the Un
ited States was $16,000,000,000.
The farmers owned $8,000,000,
000, or one-half of our total
wealth. Our wealth is at pres
ent estimated at $140,000,000,000,
of which $41,000,000,000 is farm
property, but all of this $41,000,
000,000 does not belong to the
farmer. Foreign and American
corporations, land companies,
rich individuals who do not till
the soil, and people engaged in
other vocations own $14,000,000,
000, or about 37 per cent of the
farm wealth of the United States.
This leaves in the possession of
he real farmer $27,000,000,000
worth of farm property and this
is owned only by a part of them,
for in 1910, 37 per cent of the
farmers were tenants, and it is
safe to say that since the 1910
census our tenantry has increas
ed to not less than 40 per cent.
In a little more than fifty years
the wealth owned by the farmers
has changed from 55 per cent i to
20pereent, so in the name tof
justice, in the name of all that
is near and dear to us, in this
the greatest country under the
sun, I ask what are we going to
do to save our country from a
system of slavery on the - farms
far worse than any system of
slavery ever known?
This is the vital issue which
must not be obscured , by any
other question. This is the is
sue that must be faced, and must
be settled. And we, as produc
ers of wealth, and the ones upon
whom our nation must depend
for prosperity in time of peace
and for soldiers in time of war,
and for the necessaries of life at
all times, have a right to demand
of our Congressmen and Sena
tors a system of rural credits
with direct government loans at
a low rate of interest without the
intervention of any other money
ed interest, that will enable us
to reverse the system of tenantry,
debt and mortgage, and bring
about the ownership of independ
ent homes. And today, we place
the creed of our patriotic fore
fathers in the forefront of this
mighty organization and say to
every public servant that "he
who is not for us is against us."
We know no pirty, nor parti
sanism. What use? All parties,
all partisan organizations, have
known their loyal spirits, have
'nown their betrayers. "In the
tford unspoken is the silence of
God" and in the non-partisan
judgment of those who place
country above class, above per
sons, is the seat of the mighty
like the arm of omnipotence it
self. The time calls for men. While
Washington prayed in the snows
of Valley Forge, Robert Morris,
a plain, practical banker, put re
sources behind the pitiable, strug
gling, starving Continental army.
Washington was not the radical
that Thomas Jefferson was;
Thomas Jefferson was not the
iron man we had in Andrew
Jackson, but in all of these, ac
cording to his talents, we had a
man who disdained class and
stood for the peoplethe human
rights upon which love of coun
try rests. We cannot measure
ill by one yardstick. Strength
and genius differ, but he who
does in a time of need that which
he can do is the patriot, and may
the Almighty pity those who
think only of how best to pro
note their own prosperity and
comfort!
I appeal to those who hear me,
not for my sake, or for the sake
of the Farmers' Union, but for
the sake of Georgia, to stand
fast to the principles that shall
blaze the way for real economic
freedom for these United States
and for the world. Upon Geor
gia, upon those who are now
within the hearing of my voice,
rests the responsibility for a new
and regenerated world. Europe
with its devastation of militaay
struggle, America with its no
less awful devastation of indus
trial war, await the light of man
ly peace not pusillanimous sur
render, the peace of an economic
cemetery in which the majority
decay and a few fatten, but. the
strong, calm, sane peace based
on stern, sound righteousness,
invincible morality and the- ap
plication, for the first time in. all
the ages, of the Golden Rule, in
the relations of man and man,
Georgia's Lynching Recor
Georgia nas as good, people as
are born and reared in any state
in the union, but this better ele
ment has allowed' itself, to, be
"rough-shodded" aside while a
certain other element has made
the state a glaring example of law
lessness and bloody debauchery of
justice.
Georgia led all of the union in
the number of lynch ings last year,
breaking the record with 18 of,
these illegal executions, doubling
tjjie records of the. two states, next
fter her Alabama and Jlississip
each of which had nine.
. Would it not seem that the state
tat has produced some of, the
greatest men of the South would,
be so ashamed of this stain upon
her legal escutcheon that she would
set up the sign of "Never again"
oyer the work of a masked , mob!
And yet, with the new year just
three weeks old, she sees five, of
these base, hangings already set
down in her account book. And
all fi"e of them took place at the
same time. It seems that a Geor
gia. mob cannot v do its lynchings
in broken doses, but must have
an orgie of murder-madness with
victims : galore. One sheriff is
slain while he is supposed to have
been performing his duties; and
immediately five negroes are
strung up to trees and riddled
with bullets by members of an in
furiated mob. This is the uncivi
lized code of Mexico, not the code
of an enlightened people, and if
Georgia intends to keep up this
practice it is a pity she cannot be
moved down to the border and
annexed to the hot tamale and
hotted tempered country of the
lawless Mexicans.
If the pace of five lynchings in
three weeks is kept up, the state
will land itself outside of the pale
of civilization long before the sum
mer solstice.
And the pity of it is that the
rest of the South must bear a part
of the ignominy. As the South is
"solid," so the glory of one state
sheds a luster over all, and the
shame of one darkens the fair
name of the others. So closely, is
the section bound together that,
like a family, the 4isgraoe of one
member reflects upon all. Geor
gia is not at liberty to keep up or
to make a new record for herself
in lines of lawlessness, because she
caunot keep the shame of it all to
herself.
. The people of the state of high
ideals and love of justice and
these people are largely , in the
majority owe it to themselves,
to the rest of the South, to the
states of the entire union and to
the civilized world at large to rise
up and punish and put down that
smaller portion of the population
who spit upon the law and look
at life through the noose of a rope
that no court or judge has pre
scribed. The rest of the South
demands this.
Around those five dangling bod
ies the good people of the state
should draw "the awful circle" of
the established law, across which
no man might step and go un
whipped with the scourge of re
tribution.
Those five stains are already
upon the judgment book of pub
lic opinion, and cannot be erased.
But if Georgia allows so much as
one more to be added to the. list
she will draw upon herself a far
reaching opprobrium that will be
hard to bear or to, live down.
Right here Is the place for her to
write "finis" to the story of her
lynchings. Oommercial-AppeaL

TH Liar,
It is related ia bibical lore than
Ananias and Saphjra were struck
dead for lying, tf such a heaven
ly edict should oe issued today
they would bury men and women
in trenches.
The lie has become a convention
al method of avoiding compromis
ing difficulties. We lie to each
other with the most serene coun
tenances. Men lie to their, wives
and wivei lie to their husbands.
We lie in business and wink : and
think that the white lie does . not
count.
Witnesses purjure themselves in
courts of justice where honor is
supposed to preside.
When the blind poet Milton
said, "Give me liberty, to know,
to think, to believe, to utter , free
ly according to conscience above
all liberties," he echoed the real
spirit of man. But this sentiment
is based upon truth. Truth is the
foundation of any peaceful home.
Truth is the-very, foundation of
our present civilization.
There is no vice that covers a
man with bo much shame as the
deliberate habit of lying. All
that such a man gains is the tri
bute of not being believed when
he tells the truth, "
There 'is another point which
might be suggested to our modern
liars. When they lie they should
have pretty good memories When
a man goes before a court and tells
the truth the shrewdest of cross
examiners cannot shake him or
make him deviate from the evid
ence given. The liar is liable to
get badly mixed up unless he has
a perfect memory.
One lie must be bolstered up by
another, If not it will soon fall
down.
The harmless lie sometimes does
the greatest hurt A lie about a
woman will shatter a reputation.
It may be inadvertently uttered
but the dart goes home and all of
the retractions which may follow
will not relieve the lingering sting
of suspicion. Men sometimes hu
morously indulge in a lie about
each other, but they do not rea
lize how a rolling stone gathers
moss and what, the .' result of the
lie may be.
One of the . greatest , virtues in
this world is $09 plain truth and
the greatest recognition of . this is
to use it. .
A seemingly harmless lie in more
than oae instance has resulted in
disaster.
We art getting very careless of
the truth and when we begin to
realise. .tha&fty t)LN& Jove are two

Th Farm Dairy.
There is an unlimited and an
undeveloped field for the produce
of the dairy. Much has been done
to hamper the consumption of
milk, cream and butter by city re
gulations and inspection and by
transportation dufliculties; but
these will gradually disappear
when the dairymen realize that
the best profit comes from the pro
ducts that are best protected and
best prepared to attract the atten
tion of the consumer.
Milk is the primal food of the
race, yet the consumption of milk
and milk products is lamenta
bly light when compared to the
consumption of other products.
The consumption of beer and whis
kep, is inrignificant.
The dairyman should make the
consumer realize that there is no
substitute for milk and milk pro
ducts, and that whatever enlarges
milk consumption improves the
health of the race.
Let the farmer begin this work
at home, let him improve his own
dairy; add a cow or two; give the
members of his family all the dairy
products they can consume; watch
the effect on the health. Then
let him develop a milk route or a
butter route of his own. to be
served, if he prefers, by his own
wagon or automobile. Then he
and his neighbors can join to ship
milk and cream and butter to the
nearest town, and . so , the traffic
will grow.
But the condition of success is,
the production of the Ixst milk at
the lowest price. You must,
therefore, study the question of
the best cow for the dairy and the
best care and feeding of that cow.

Mrs. L'Estelle Van Zandt Barclay is
now in Chicago rehearsing for a com
ing tour with the Venetians, a small
but noted troup of high class musicians,
of which she is to be a notable member.
Their tour will begin this fall and ex
tend into next spring and will cover
New England, New York and the mid
dle and middle western states. Mrs.
Barclay will perform on the violincello,
guitar and piano.
Music lovers of Macon will watch
Mrs. Barclay's career on the profession
al stage with a great deal of kindly in
terest and confidence. Coming here
from Kansas City where she had been
organist in one of the largest churches,
she from the start took a grea t inter
est and an active part in the musical
life of the town and did a great deal in
developing the taste for fine music
,iere. Her main work was with the
Baptist choir which under her encour
agement and management gave some
or the best local music ever heard here.
Its most notable achievement was the
rendition of Gabriel's cantata, "The
Nazarcne," Her music class was
showing the splendid effect of her
teaching when her present duties call
ed her away. In the musical societies
here, especially the Music Teachers'
association, her work , and influence
were marked. Her charming personal
ity as well as her musical talents won
her a high place in the. regard of the
people of Macon,
From her achievements . here her
friends see. nothing, but confident ex
pectation of Mrs.. Barclay making a
splendid success in her new field.
