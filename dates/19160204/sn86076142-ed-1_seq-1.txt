CRISES Or THE WAR
Latest Note on Sinking of the
Lusitania will not be
Kindly Received
(By Aasoclated Press.)
BERLIN, Feb. 4. Information reaching the Associated Press indicated
that under no circumstances will Germany admit that the sinking of the
Lusitania was an illegal act. The inHtructlons forwarded to Count Von Iierns
torff, according to Information, contain simply one phrase of new formulation
of the proposed note of regret. It suggested that the sentence consists of only
eight words and does not contain the word "Illegal." It represents the limit
of Germany's concessions in the Lusitania case. It Is viewed here as one of
the most serious crises that have arisen in the war and It is impossible to
forsee the outcome. The reBult of the negotiations appears to hinge on the
word "Illegal." The Associated Press Is informed positively and authorita
tively thai. Germany cannot and will not designate as illegal the sinking of a
liner by any submarine.

AIR SQUADRONS IN
FREQUENT EVIDENCE
Turkish Troops Evacuate One of
Their Strongholds on the
Caucasian Front
A most Interesting development Is
shown at the extieine western point
of operation of the Tonopah Exten
sion mining company un the 1350-foot
level. The vein at this point has nar
rowed to about a foot In width but is
of very high grade.
After maintaining a length almost
unparalleled In the history of Tono
pah, the lens on the 1260 knifebladed
out. In running the two drifts to the
westward, the farther the advance
made, the nearer the cap rock was ap
proached, until It finally was reached,
as the ground to the westward slopes
away and the depth of the capping
seems to be uniform.
. The only conclusion to be reached
Is that the Extension, with Its vast
resources east of the above referred
touoint of exploration. Is really only
on the top of Its ore bodies. This Is
further shown by the Incline winze
that Is being sent down on the Mur
ray vein In order to connect with the
Victor crosscut, which Is being ad
vanced on the 1540 level. When the
Victor working reaches the Extension
Incline, a drift, It la understood, will
be extended westward and very In
teresting developments are expected.
The Extension management is so
confident of its stores of ore as well
as of the appreciated price of Bilver,
that it is pouring concrete in freezing
weather In order to have the founda
tions ready for the Installation of ma
chinery for the enlarged mill, which
is now on the way from the manu
facturers. Large bonfires are kept go
ing through the night to keep the con
crete in the molds at a temperature
that will assure proper setting. The
Extension Is now the most Interest
ing property in Tonopah, as is Judged
by the Inquiries regarding It which
are coming in from the east respect
ing this property.
