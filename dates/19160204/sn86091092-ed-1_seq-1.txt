LOCAL MEN FILE ON WASTE
IRRIGATION WATER
Plan to Reclaim 5,000 Acres Near the
City This Year.
H. A. Griffiths and associates have
been granted permission by the state
engineer to divert 50 second feet of
water from the Wilson slough and 25
second feet from the Mason creek
drainage ditch, for the purpose of re_
claiming bv irrigation a tract of land
of about 5.000 acres between Cald
well and Notus. The construction
work will be done this year. Water
will be ready for delivery in 1917 if
the plans of the local men do not mis
carry.
Short Canal Needed.
By means of an open concrete ditch
and a steel pipe flume over the Boise
river, it is planned to carry the water
from the Wilson slough ditch to the
lands below Caldwell. The distance
the water must be conveyed is but
little more than three miles, the plan
being to divert this stream from the
government ditch at the point where
:he Boise Valley Traction company's
line crosses the drainage channcl
something more than a mile east of
town.
Development of the project will be
started first by use of the Wilson
slough water only. Subsequently, if
this is found to be insufficient, a can
al from the Mason creek waste water
ditch will be added to the system.
It is acknowledged that suit by the
government may be necessary in or
der to clear all doubts as to title to
the water right filed on. The pro
moters say they have no fear of the
outcome of such suit.

SUIT AGAINST T. M. NICHOL
Recovery of $1500.00 Demanded by
Plaintiff to the Aaction.
Civil suit for $1500.00 was filed in
the district court yesterday by Mrs.
N. E. Bedford, through her attorney,
fudge Curtis Haydon, against T. M.
Nichol. This suit is brought to recov
er the amount stated. The nlaintiff re
cites that she authorized the defend
ant to sell a tract of land she owned
in the Gem District at a minimum
price of $1,000.00. The land was sold
to G. E. Littletield who traded in a
place in Oregon and gave a mortgage
'o Mrs. Bedford for $1,000.00 on the
Gem district land. The plaintiff al
leges that the defendant represented
that the Oregon property was not
worth more than a resonable commis
sion for transacting the business.
The complaint alleges thät the Ore
gon property was sold for $1500. The
deed to the Oregon property was
made to a third person, November 1,
1915.
To date all that Mrs. Bedford has
received is a mortgage on the prop
erty she owned for $1,000.00.

GOVERNMENT TO IRRIGATE
ENTIRE BLACK CANYON
Most Favorable Report Made bv Mid
dleton Settlers' Committee.
(Middleton Herald.)
The mass meeting of the Settlers'
Reclamation association of Middleton
held Wednesday afternoon, was well
attended. The settlers had come to
hear the report of the investigating
committee as to what had been learn
rd regarding prospect of irrigation by
the reclamation service.
The committee's report was com
plcte, covering their work since their
appointment, and was, on the whole,
very encouraging. The report
summed up in the statement that
the committee will irrigate all the land
they can possible cover with a high
line ditch and that it all depends on
whether the money will be made
available for action.
There are reasons which lead the
committee to believe that prospects
ire exceedingly favorable for money
from the Arrowrock surplus be made
available for this work, and that the
ettlers have every reason for en
couragement.
The committee was continued in
its work and will report again at any
time it has information worth vChile
Dr. and Mrs. W. F. Gigrav moved
from the residence they have occupied
for a long time on Dearborn Street to
the new bungalow recently erected for
them by Mrs. Julia Parks.

The trade letter of the Caldwell
Commercial bank for January has

tone of business here is decidedly op
timistic. Trade continues good,
prices on farm products and livestock
generally are advancing. Real estate
movements are becoming more fre
quent, building continues and Cald
well citizens are closer united than
ever. So we predict that 1916 will be

Market Conditions.
The local^market conditions are re
ported bv the bank as follows:
Hay—We are informed that $11.00
per ton has been paid for baled hay
f. o. b. cars here, and from $6.50 to $7
per ton in the stack. There is still
some surplus hay for sale in the val
ley.
Grain—Wheat, as also other grains
have made a marked advance since our
- .st letter. The Caldwell Milling &
Elevator Company reports paying
$1.60 cwt., for wheat; $1.25 cwt., for
oats and $1.25 cwt., for barley. The
advance in prices has caused a con
siderable movement in grains and a
lumber who have been holding have
disposed of their entire crop, believing
hat market prospects did not justify
holding any longer.
Corn—There is now a market for
shelled corn and $1.40 cwt., is being
paid. Several prizes were awarded to
exhibitors from this vicinity at the St.
Paul Corn Show, held under the aus
picies of the First National Bank of
it. Paul.
Livestock—Hog prices are advanc
ing and we are informed that $6.5(
cwt. is now being paid here and higher
prices are predicted. The future for
better prices for hogs is looking more
favorable now than for some time
Cattle have also shown an upward
tendency in recent sales and prime,
well finished steers are now being sold
at some profit to the feeder.
Poultry—There is a strong demand
for heavy hens: in fact, much greater
ban the supply. Dealers today are
>aying 9c lb. live weight for heavy
'lens; 8c live weight for light chick
ens: 14c lb. for turkevs and 8c lb. for
ducks and geese. We believe our
customers would do well to add to
their flocks of poultry for market for
next fall.
Eggs—The price for eggs is de
clining and with the milder weather
will likely continue to decline. The
cash price paid today is 30c dozen.
Cream—Cream receipts arc increas
ng with prices steady. Today's quo
ation on butter fat is 28c lb., and 30c

REPORT ON NORTH AND
SOUTH R. R. FILED
WITH GOVERNOR
COMMITTEE DOES NOT STATE
COST OF THE PROPOSED
ENTERPRISE NOR WHERE
MONEY IS TO COME.
Extra Session of Legislature Recom
mended—Jerome J. Day Goes East
—High Taxes Bob Up to Confound
Democrats—Explanations That Do
Not Explain are Presented.
lioise, Feb. 2.—The North and South
railroad proposition has again bobbed
up serenely. It comes to the atten
tion of the public in two ways—a re
port from the special commission ap
pointed by Governor Alexander and
an alleged proposition from a Chicago
"rm to finance the road.
The commission reports that the
railway proposition is entirelv feasible
and calls upon the governor to con
vene the legislature in extra session
speedily" for the purpose of "inau
gurating surveys, procuring rights of
way, and devising ways and means
for construction."
The cost of the enterprise has not
been made a part of the report. Just
why this important information has
been overlooked is not apparent. This
unfortunate because a great many
people have looked upon the pronosed
Vorth and South railroad as political
buncombe, and such an omission, so
essential to the determination of the
merits of the enterprise, will not
strengthen public confidence.
The cost of the construction of a
line from New Meadows to Grange
ville has variously been estimated ai
from $7.000,000 to $11,000,000. The
ost could be shaved slightly by em
ploying convict labor, as the commis
sion suggests, but all the convict la
"'ior available in the state of Idaho
.vould not go verv far towards build
ng a railroad. The expense would
l iave to be met by the sale of bonds
hich would eventually have to be
oaid by the taxpayers of the state, or
by a subsidy to some construction
ompany, a scheme not at all popular
ind now in complete discard in older
states.
That the citizens, of Idaho want a
Vorth and South railroad is not to be
lorMed and they also want a road
to Butte and a road to Winnemucca
How to finance them is the great
problem. State aid means higher
taxes, the particular misfortune that
ve are trying to get away. from.
Return of Confidence.
It is believed by many that the solu
tion of the railway problem in Idaho
will be settled by a return of confi
dence and prosperity. Capital will al
ways be found for financing railway
propositions, in good times, when it
can be shown that there is sufficient
business to justify the cost of con
struction. Any sound business ven
ture must rest upon this basis. If it
can be shown that there is profit to
apital in building a Vorth and South
railroad, the capital will be forthcom
ing as soon as we have a return of
normal conditions. The election of a
Republican president next fall will do
more to bring about railroad building
in Idaho than any other agency that
could be named.
The outlook for a North and Soutii
railroad is by no means dark. The
I'ittsburg & Gilmtre line was built to
Salmon City with the intention of ex
tending the road on down «he Salmon
to Lewiston. If this road were ex
tended as originally planned, the gap
between North and South Idaho, so
far as railway connection was conccrn
od, would be only 27 miles. It would
then be to the advantage of the Paci
fic & Idaho Northern to extend their
line on from New Meadows to the
Salmon and close up the gap. This
seems at this time to lie the most like
ly solution of the North and South
railroad problem. The sooner con
fidence is restored the sooner capital
will be available. The election of a
Republican president will restore
confidence. We must have a confi
dence based upon something more
durable than war orders. The war will
end sometime—what then? The ans
,ver to that question is what worries
capital and causes it to halt when sol
icited to invest in big enterprises. The
character of the next administration Is
important as regards the industrial
development of the country, hence as
to railroad construction in Idaho, and
this applies to tire construction of a
Vorth and South railroad, as well as a
railroad to Winnemucca or Butte.
Senator Jerome J. Day, a mem
ber of the North and South Railroad
Commission, has gone to Chicago to
confer with some gentlemen who have
found capital, they allege, to construct
the North and South railway. Every
one will wish the Senator success and
their anxiety for his success will be so
great that he should not cruelly keep
the public long in the dark as to who
our benefactors are and what their
proposition is.
High T*xes Haunt Democracy.
Democratic organs are publishing
long columns of tigures relative to tax
levies with a view to excusing their
party for a failure to keep faitk with
the taxpayer in their pledge to reduce
taxes. The tax situation haunts the
Democratic brethern and well it may.
They were going to save the taxpay
ers a million dollars and reduce taxes.
It did not rest with the legislature oi
county comissioncrs according to their
campaign declarations, but the gover
nor could do it all. He was to be the
great 1 Am who was going to "yank"
everything. He has had full sway in
his vanking process and here are the
results:
1 lie following facts are taken from
statistics appearing in Democratic or
gans: The tax levy has been reduced
Detwecn 3 and 4 cents on the $100 of
valuation for state purposes. This
means a saving of thirty to forty cents
on a thousand dollar assessment. On
a five thousand dollar assessment It
•■vould be five time that amount. If a
farmer's total assessment was $5,000
it would mean that the saving to him
would amount to $1.50 and possibly
$2.00. The reduction in state taxes is
certainly nothing to crow about. But
let us pursue these Democratic tigures
a little further. We find that the to
tal tax levied for all state purposes
and all county purposes was higher in
1915 than in 1914, in 19 of the 37
counties of the state while there was
no reduction in four others. Only 14
counties showed a reduction as against
"9 that showed an increase. Of the
14 that showed a decrease, the
amounts were small in at least half.
The increases in many instances were
very material. In Ada county it
amounted to an increase in the levy of
26 cents. In Bannock, 18.3; in Clear
water, 82.7; in Gooding, 36; in Idaho,
26; in Lewis, 61.5. These counties
will serve to show how the increases
compare with the slight saving made
on state taxes alone. A farmer In
Ada county assessed at $5,000 in 1914
and the same in 1915 will pay for state
and county purposes $13 more in his
taxes, and in Clearwater county he
would pay $41.35 more, and, in like
manner, more in the other counties,
in proportion to the increase in levy.
But our Democratic friends tell us
that this increase is all due to the ex
travagance of the county commis
sioners. Well, suppose that it is, what
then lias a Democratic governor got
♦o do with the tax question? How can
he reduce taxes? The answer is self
evident from the results of one year
if experience tindr a Democratic gov
rnor. What, then, is the use of elect
ing a Democratic governor? That was
! he stock argument for electing a
Democratic governor last year—that
">e would reduce taxes. The Demo
•rats claimed that high taxes were due
•o Republican extravagance at the
state house, but thev now acknowlede''
that charge to be false by blaming this
year's high taxes onto the extrava
gance of county commissioners. Is
it any wonder that the tax situation is
t nightmare to the Democrats in Ida
ho?
Bee Inspector's Report.
Nearly every voter in Idaho will re
call that the "Bee Inspector" was quite
'n issue in the campaign of 1914. The
Hemocrats' were horrified to find that
there was an official so designated. It
vas presumed that that would be the
'irst official that Governor Alexander
•vould "yank" out of the state house.
The Democrats were great for "seeing
•liings" during the campaign which
they see differently now. It was
charged that a Republican Bee In
spector had a stinger while it must
be that a Democratic Bee Inspector
Tins no such harmful business end, else
why would the Democrats retain him.
An official report has been filed in the
executive office signed, "Bee In

"The snowstorm experienced yes

"Some snow fell on 20 of the 31

storm up to Wednesday noon was
about 14 inches, but the great weight
caused some settling."
City Cleans Up Snow.
Wednesday night, with commend

MR. BRANDEIS NEEDES
NINE MORE VOTES
Poll Taken by Friends in the Senate
Shows Only Forty.
Louis D. Brandeis, the Boston law
yer, nominated for the Supreme Court
by President Wilson, could muster
Monday but 40 votes in the United
States senate for his confirmation.
It requires 49 votes to confirm. Mr.
Brandeis must win from the 10 doubt
ful votes or make converts among the
46 Senators, more or less, opposed to
him.
The poll of the Senate was taken
hastily by friends of Brandeis and
may show some inaccuracies later,
but it proves that the confirmation is
not to be made without a fight.
When the Senate committee on the
judiciary met this morning to consider
the nomination of Mr. Brandeis, Sen
ator Overman, acting chairman of the
committee, appointed a subcommittee
if five members for the most oart re
garded as friendly to Mr, Brandeis to
study his qualifications. The sub
committee consists of Senators Chil
ton of West Virginia, Fletcher of Flo
rida and Walsh of Montana, Demo
crats, and Cummings of Iowa and
Clark of Wyoming, Republicans. Mr.
Clark is supposed to be the only hos
tile member of the subcommittee.
The subcommittee is ready to hold
hearings and to listen to witnesses for
and against Mr. Brandeis. The sub
committee will hold its first meeting
Thursday morning. Before that time
individual members will have looked
into Mr. Brandeis' published remarks
•,nd some aspects of his record.
Representative Kent, of California,
an Independent Republican, told the
subcommittee that Lieutenant Gover
nor Eschelman, of California, would
give favorable testimony to Mr.
Brandeis in connection with matters
participated in jointly bv Mr. Bran
deis and himself. In connection with
some of these matters Mr Brandeis
had been accused of bad faith.
