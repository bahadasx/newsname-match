fy. Mr. Logan- eave vent to
strong statements regarding de
-pleradlo conditions at the State
capital-
"Thereiii no need to dig down,"
asserted Mr. Logan. "Ton have
only to scratcb tho surface to
discover it."
Ono of the discouraging fea
tures of the situation to bis mind
'is that any attempt to correct
conditions is mot only with the
strongest opposition. Unneces
sary oxponse accounts and de
partment salary and expense rolls
of illegal size are tho chiof fea
lures so far encountered.
It cost $01,000 last year to run
the office of the depattment of
L education. That included only
the office expenses. This Bum
was greator than tlio cost of con
duct of the auditor's attorney
goneral's and the Governor's of
fice combined.
'Tho department mode a rer
quest for seven stenographers,"
said Mr. Logan. "1 don't kuow
bow many they need. But' if
Mr. V. 0. Gilbert bos the right
to nppoint seven ho has just as
much legal authority to nppoint
700, with no limitations on their
isalary. When I declined to coun-
itouance such a procedure, I be
gan to be assailed in letters from
all over the state, wanting to
know whether I was opposed to
Tho common school system.
Xet Him Appeal to Assembly
"'If the superintendent needs
-seven stenographers let him go
to tho Legislature, which is the
only body that has the power to
grant him that many, and ask
-for it. Then there- will be notb
ine to prevout the naming of
wife, brother, Bister or any other
relative who has never written a
line of shorthand in his life."
"The worst part of it is, that
no one regards tho law. If the
legislature says you can't uo a
certain thing it's dono anyway.
lowed $23,000 a year to run on.
It has been using $80,000 with'
out any apologies. In tho last
report from that office I noted
that 'exprosasge' for 1016 cost
$1,500. That was almost twice
as muoh as tho year before, aud
I know that such a sum couldn't
have been expended for express
age, I detailed Mr, -Hick to look
into it, und he reports that the
money was spout in cuing ufter
requisitioned prisoners. The ho
couut used to be chnrgod to ox
pross agent, and the custom has
contiuued.
What One Trip Cost
"One trip of an officer to Mich
igan cost the Stato over $200.
He didn't got the prisoner, and
tho law expressly forbids pay
ment of expenses unless the pris
oner is bagved. Ilia next trip in
which he got 113 man, cost the
Stile $250. These sums are out
rageous. Officers have made it a

SQUARE DEAL
FOR RAILROADS
Urged by Vice-President Ma-
pother of the L. & N.
O p p osing the
Smith-Scott
' Bill
TOO MUCH AUTHORITY
GIVEN COMMISSION
By Harry Bloom
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 2. Wible L.
Mapother. first vice president, and
since the Illness of Milton H. Smith
ohief exeoutlvo of tho Louisville &
Nashville railroad, talked for half
an hour in protest against tbe en
actment of the Scott-Smith bill to
extend the powers of the Railroad
Commission before the joint com'
lmittees of the House and Senate last
imgnt. -men ur. wapotner dolled
his official togi, andjmade what he
tstmeA a man-to-man talk to the
committees.
"Forget that lam a railroad offl
clal," he said, "and that yon are
lawmakers. What is tbe situation
in tbe United Stat6i?
"I know of no parellel in any
country on the globe where tbe
greatest single industry Is left in the
absolute autooratio management of
political bodies, who make no ac
counting to anyone and possess no
qualifications exoept to gat votes,
Can you beat It? Railroading is the
greatest and most scientific biuinest
except war."
Roads Want Square Deal
Sharp fire was dlreotod by Mo
nomer against tho power to suspend
ratea pending an investigation of
their Justice. "That is the most ih
iqultous law ever enacted," he de
clared. "AH the railroads want is a
square deal, and rate suspension
doesn't give It to them."
He related the oase of tho suspen
slon of coal rates out of East St.
Louis for a year and eleyoQ months,
Dy the L 6. 6. At the end of this
time the commission declared the
Increase was justified. The railroads
lost hundreds of thousands ot dol
lars because of the suspension. Had
the rates been kept In force and la
ter reduced, the railroads would
have been compelled to rebate tbe
increases with Interest, but they
could not collect for the period of in
vestigation. Mr. Mapother termed
suspension as confiscation of prop
erty. He also Inveighed against the pro
vision to give the commission pow
er to make joint rates. Sixty-five
per cent of the L. & N's. business,
according to his estimate, was han
dling coal and arbitary Imposition
of the joint rates might tie up the
coal business.
In his oplonlon no more drastic
or radical legislation could have
beeu designed than the bill under
consideration. It was Inopportune
In hit opinion, and Iwould set baok
railroad development In the State.
The L. & N. be deolalred had spent
$20,000,000 in the past five years In
the development of East Kentucky
but he believed that tbe passage of
the Uw would threaten future de
velopement. "The country may now be on tho
verge of the greatest business pros
perity in its history," said Mr. Ma
pother, following it wlthja quotation
from a message by President Wil
son favoring the soientlflo Investi
gation of the needs of tbe railroads
and the ascertainment of the wisest
regulation.
State Rights Must Oo
"State rights must go," was Ma
pother's prophecy. "The railroads
have too many master. The L. &
N. today is compelled to obey four
teen coinmisBlotip. One commauds
one sort of screou, the next another
kind. This Btate tolls the road to
use a oirtalu caudle-power head
light, aud the next state may oem
niand another that may not be a bit
better. They oouillct ou every hand
and this sort ot thing can't go on.
The time will coma when the State
power will bw purely Ipoal. The
railroads will have but one master
to serve."
