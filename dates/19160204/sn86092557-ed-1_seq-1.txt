serious crises of the war has arisen
; in connection with the Lusitanla case
and It Is impossible to forBee the out
come from any indications here.
The result o? tho negotiations ap

Germany stand only those seven let
ters expressing the conception which
President .Wilson and Secretary Lan
I'filng Insist must be embodied In tho
German formula, expressing regret-for
the loss of American lives aboard the
Cunardor.
i Tho Associated Press is Informed
[positively and authoritivcly that Ger
many cannot and will not designate
(a?, illegal the sinking of a liner Uy any
-ibmtfrine.
.^Virtually no other difficulties in the

Status of Appam Has Been
Definitely Decided by
Lansing.
I
(By Associated FrestO
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.?Secretary
Lansing indicated today that the Uni
ted States had decided to hold that
the Prussian-American treaty governs
tho case of the Appam as Germany
contends, and that all that remains to
be decided is ;the Interpretations of
tho' treaty's terms.
The Secretary disclosed further that
the sole question to be declded.by_.thej
Interpretation is how long; TEe Appam
should be permitted, to; remain-ia Am
erican,waters. Tho treaty guarantees
to a German .prize the right to come
and go freely. If the Appam were
forced to depart she would doubtless
becomethe prey of the British cruiBers
assembling outside the Virginia capes.
If forced to depart, German officials
have stated that the ship would be
sunk to prevent her recapture by ths
British.

Germans Recapture
Lloyd Liner They Lost
BERLIN, Jan. 20.?According to fig
ures Just published by the Gorman
Medical Weekly (Deutsche Medlzi
nlsche Woerchenschrlft) the medical
corps of the German army has estab
lished better and better results al
most every month In treating the
wounded. The record at the Btart was,
In fact, a very high one, 4.8 per cent,
of the wounded being, so completly
healed that they could return to the
ranks; 3 per cent dying, and the re
maining 12.2 per cent, being discharg
ed as unfit for further service or sent
away on furlough for later examina
tion.
The figures improved from then on
till the number of men returning to
duty in May, June and July reached
above 91 per cent. The most striking
Improvement was the reduction In the
ratio of deaths; these amounted In
June and July to only 1.2 per cent,
of the wounded, as compared with 3
per cent, for August, 1914. Similarly
the ratio of wounded men sent home
unfit for duty or furloughed for fur
ther observation was reduced from
12.2 to 7. For the first year of the
war the total record was as follows:
89.5 healed and returned to the ranks;
discharged as unfit for duty or for
further observation, and only 1.7 per
cent died.
