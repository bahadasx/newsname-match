Says Wilson
President Says Al! We Need is
Quantity, We Have the Qual?
ity?Will Keep Country Out
of War, He Says.
Milwaukee, Wis., Jaa. 31?A throng
of 9,000 persons, the largest thut has
greeted President Wilson since he
started on his recent tour, cheered
him lustily here today when he said
he believed the danger of a division
of domestic sentiment was past, and
added that he never doubted that the
danger was exaggerated.
Referring again to the nations de?
sire for peace, the President gave his
hearers the pledge that, God helping
me, I will keep it out of war if it is
possible.
"And I want at the outset to remove
any misapprehension in your minds,"
said the President. "There is no cris?
is; nothing new has happened. I came
to confer with you on a matter which
we should confer on in any event. We
should see that our house is set in
order. When all the world is on fire,
the sparks fly everywhere."
The President said the presence of
the vast crowd attested the interest
of the people of Wisconsin in his
mission.
"American has drawn her blood
and her energy out of almost all of the
nations of the world," he said. "We
know that our roots and our tra?
ditions run best into our soils."
"At the outset of the war it did
not look as if there were a division of
domestic sentimet which lead up in?
to some errors of judgment. I for one
believe that the danger is past. I
never doubted that the danger was
exaggerated. I for my part always
feel a serene confidence in waiting to
a declaration of the principles nnd
sentiments of the men who are now
vociferous, who do their own think?
ing, attend to their own business and
leave everything else alone.
"I have not supposed that the men
whose voices seemed to show a threat
against us represented even the people
they claimed to represent.
"I know the magic of America. I
know the impulses which draw men
to our shores. I know that they came
to bo free.
I know that when the test comes,
every man's heart will be first for
America," he declared amid applause.
"The trouble-makers have shot their
bolt. They have been loud, but ineffec?
tual. Talk was cheap, and that was all
it cost them. There are dangers, how?
ever which are past our control, and
which have not been overcome,' dan?
gers we cannot control. We can con?
trol the irresponsible talkers in our
midst. All we have to do is to en?
courage them Jo hiro a hall, and
they will abundantly advocate their
own folly.
"There is daily, hourly danger that
they will feel constrained to do things
which are absolutely inconsistent with
the rights of the United States. They
are not thinking of us. They are
thinking first of their own affairs.
"The very uncalculated course of
affairs may touch us to the quick at
any time. Standing in the midst of
these difficulties, I want you to know
I am in difficulty."
Possible Danger Ahead.
He went on to say the nation want?
ed him to preserve the honor of the
United States, but said there may be
Sit any moment a time he could not
preserve the honor and the peace of
the United States.
"Do not exact of men an impossi?
ble and contradictory thing but stand
ready and insist that everybody who
represents you should stand rendy to
provide tho means for maintaining the
honor of the United States?" he asked
"I want the people to know some?
thing of military life if the call should
come. That is the reason I am urg?
ing on the Congress of the United
States that at least a part of the peo?
ple be trained. We have got down,
not to the sentiment of national de?
fense, but to the business of national
^defense. Even that arch-Democrat,
Thomas Jefferson, believed in compul?
sory military education.
"There is another misapprehension
I want to remove from your minds.
I dont doubt that these things to
prepare for defenso will be done. I
believe that our people are entitled
to know just what is being done.
"I am not here to convert you; I'm
not here to argue with you, ;I'm just
telling you. It has been very sedu?
lously spread abroad this country
that the impulse back of all this is
the desire of men who make the ma
? terials of warfare to make money out
of the treasury of the United States.
I wish the people who say that it is,
could see meetings like this one. Did
you come for that purpose? Of course
you did not.
"If a government does not manu?
facture what it wants somebody will
make money. I have been urging that
the government' itself get ready to
make what it wants, so that we can
at least control prices. I assure you
that the government will at lenst be
able to regulate tho matter. I and
my colleagues are watchful in this
matter.
Larger Navy Needed.
"Criticisms havo nlso been made ol
our navy.
"All the-navy lacks is quantity. Ir
size it is fourth. I think if it had t<
give tin account of itself, however,
it would be raised above fourth place.
"What wo are proposing now is not
tho sudden creation of a navy. We
have a splendid navy. Wo are, simply
working on a program that will give
the navy in five years the same
strength that it otherwise might take
eight years to give. Th jro is no sud?
den change of plans.
"We are woi king out American
problems a little faster because
American pulses arc beating a little
faster, because the world is now in a
whirl because there are incalculable
olpmcnts of trouble abroad which we
cannot control. 1 would be derelict
in my duty if 1 did not tell you that
it is absolutely necessary to carry out
this program now.
"And yet, all the lime, I believe we
are merely interpreting the spirit of
Americn. When wo prepare for na?
tional defense we prepare for na?
tional political integrity.
"As I came along the line of rail?
way today, I was touched to observe
that on every standard where a flag
could be raised, there floated the Stars
and Stripes.
"Do not deceive yourself as to where
the colors of that flag came from.
Those lines of red are lines of blood,
nobly and unselfishly shed by men
who loved liberty of their fellow men
more than they loved their own lives
and fortunes. God forbid that we
should have to use the blood of Amer?
ica to freshen the color of the flag
but if it should ever be necessary
again to assert the majesty and in?
tegrity of those ancient and honor
able principles, that flag will be col?
ored once more, and in being colored
will be glorified nnd purified."
REMEDY FORJONDITIONS
Senator Thomas S. Martin Be?
lieves if Instructions Are Fol?
lowed, Situation Can be
Handled With Great Ease
Richmond, Va.,' Fob. 3.?Senator
Martin today sent the following let?
ter to tho Virginia Anti-Tuberculo?
sis Association in acknowledgment
of copy of report just received by
him:
"In response to your request that I
give some expression of my views
relative to the report of the Tubercu?
losis commission appointed last year
by his excellency, Governor Henry C.
Stuart, I beg to say, that after going
over the recommendations of the com?
passion I feel that they are sound
und practicalhle and should commend
themselves to the wise judgment of
our legislature. They indicate a deal
of painstaking effort on the part of
the commissioon and suggest conser?
vatism and reasonableness through?
out.
The very high death rate among
the negroes from tuberculosis has
been long recognized by persons at
all familiar with the subject. As
domestic servants they come in closer
relations wtih our families, so that
education and control in this direction
is vastly important, to curb the rav?
ages of the disease throughout the
State. Prevention should bo the
watchword, and this can bo best se?
cured through education of the pub?
lic as to tho methods and means
whereby the spread of the disease may
be prevented. In the ratio that pre?
ventive methods, or education, is dis?
seminated will the increase of tuber?
culosis in the State be found.
Tuberculosis ir.volvc3 a I0113 period
of suffering, expense nnd waste upon
its victims and their relations. In com?
mon with all public spirited citizens,
I feel, of course, the deepest interest
in a subject involving, as this does,
security to the health and life of tho
people of Virginia. Apart from the
humanitarianism, which in itself is
impelling, in protecting our citizens
from the suffering and misfortunes
incident t tuberculosis there is also
to be considered the economic side
of the question. As shown by the
report of the commission, tho wage
loss in- Virginia in 1914 through
deaths from tuberculosis was not far
short of two million dollars, and the
cost for care of these decedents, dur?
ing their illness, is placed at a mil?
lion and a half dollars. This eco?
nomic loss is quite startling, but when
it is remembered that its cause is
preventable it becomes appalling.
? remedy for the situation in Vir?
ginia is clearly pointed out in the rec?
ommendations of the commission,
which plainly outlines tho necessary
and essential beginnings in order to
successfully combat the ravages of
this dread disease on the health and
life of so many of our citizens. I
certainly hope that the report of the
commission will receive at tho hands
of the Legislature that careful con?
sideration to which, I feel, it is en?
titled."

THC ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE AND
DKY LEGISLATION.
Big Stone Gap, Va., Jan 28.
Editor C. V. News: I have just re?
ceived your paper, which was pub?
lished today and am shocked to see
in its columns that thlucfll ftlnftlnfn
in its columns that the anti-saloon
league of Virginia has gone on rec?
ord as favoring compromise legisla?
tion with tho devil as regards the
liquor traffic. I use the word devil, be?
cause he is surely the proper dcfend
nn in this cnsc instead of the whiskey
trust. I do not condemn the man that
makes the whiskey, or the man who
sells it. Why should we? They have
a legal right. Neither do I condemn
the man who drinks it, starves his
family, whips his wife, shoots down
his fellow man and now stands on the
gallows ready to be executed for his
crime. Is he to blame? I answer with?
out the least fear of contradiction.
No! Then who is to blame? I an?
swer in the language of the deciples,
"Lord is it I?" Yes, it is me. I feel
like stepping into the shoes of the
man on the gallows, adjusting the
rope around my own neck and spring?
ing the trap myself. Why? I am a
sober, law abiding citizen. Why should
I bo executed in place of the drunk?
ard? Ah, I put the bottle to his
lips, because I sent a man to the leg?
islature who helped to make a law
so his neighbor could manufacture
and sell whiskey to the weaker man
who would shoot down his fellow man.
Yes, I am guilty.. Is not the stain of
his blood upon my hands?
Is there any good reason Tor the
manufacture or sale of liquor. Huve
any moral or physical benefits ever
been realized from its sale, and has it
not been condemned by leading phy?
sicians and surgeons?
Why is it necessary to put it in the
drug stores? Can any fair thinking
man in the State of Virginia find any
good reason why it should not be put
out. If the anti-saloon league can
give any reason for their position at
this time, I certainly would like to
have it, for I am looking for excuses
for what I have done in the past.
No, sir; I am not praying for the
good Lord to put it into the hearts of
the men that make it to stop, nor the
man who sells it to quit selling it;
neither the drunkard to stop drinking
it. I am very selfish in this. I am
asking God to please forgive me for
giving my support to the representa?
tive in the legislature who voted for a
law to legalize the manufacture and
sale of liquors.
Now, friends lets get rid of the old
sin. Lets not have any more widows,
or orphans of executed drunknrds
made so by our voting for such rep?
resentatives. We cannot afford to
compromise. We do not want to
compromise. We demonstrated this
fact at the September election, 1014.
We voted for sate-wide prohibition
and we got it. Now, for the sake of
our own souls, humanity and decen?
cy, let's have it. Let every voter who
voted for state-wide prohibition in
1914, wake up and write their rep?
resentative, both in the legislature
and senate such strong letters that it
will be impossible for them to do oth?
erwise than cast their ballots for pro?
hibition.
Yours to this end, M.

Out of Mud'
Burkes Garden Makes Flea For
More Road Money?Favors
New Bond Issue II Properly
Expended.
Editor tho News:?Everybody who at?
tended the good roads meeting last
Saturday was struck with one thing at
least?tho people are for good roads
and they ore going to have them some
way. Every other way to get them
except through another bond issue
seems hazy or impractical that senti?
ment has developed overwhelmingly
for another bond issue right up to tho
limit. At least this is so in the Clear
Pork district. In Burke's Garden, en?
thusiasm is running higher than ever
before. Most of us see no other so?
lution than a bond issue and are
ready to vote. There are some influ?
ential citizens, however, who still
question the wisdom of the bond is?
sue. Maybe some of them oppose it,
as some times strong-minded men will
just because they said they would.
Change your mind, fellows and come
across. It is said to be a mark of
greatness to change your mind when
you are wrong, and maybe that is
about all the claim to greatness most
of us will ever have. Let's drop that
old issue as to how to raise the mon?
ey and spend our energy on getting
the worth of our money when it. is
spent. Your correspondent believes
with the majority that it is the real
crux of the matter here in Burko's
Garden. If our people really felt
that they were going to get some
roads this time they would "fall in"
and "go marching on" to glory. But
in the light of past experience is it
any wonder that some of our folks
are opposed to voting any more tux
money until they are assured that
Uurke's Garden is going to get her
part of it. That was the "nigger in
the wood-pile" at Ta/.ewell last Sat?
urday when the little scrap came up
between Burke's Garden and the dolo
from the other end of the district.
There are other "niggers" in other 1
wood-piles, but that's tho one in ours
this time and if it is any satisfaction
to know it the Grnham hustlers jump?
ed him right out. Our people want (
some roads this time and they are
mighty apt. to light a bond issue if
they don't get some mighty clear in?
dication that they are going to get
some roads this time. It may be of
interest to some of our readers to re?
view the situation in Burke's Garden
a little. In a nutshell, Burke's Gar?
den is a valley five miles across and
ten miles along. Under the old bond
issue you, (whoever you era), helped
to get us into the Garden from Grat
ton by coming over u fairly good mod?
ern road to the top of the mountain
nnd then jumping US down or sliding
us down or wnllowing, or whatever
you want to call it, to tho bottom.
And then you let us have a little
string, economically anil wisely built
by .the Mosses, our own people, to
the Station Spring Branch, i\ mile,
say, inside the Garden. Beyond that
not a dollar was spent of the bond is?
sue money to get us to church, to
school, to the blacksmith shop, store,
mill or to each other's homes. Unless
wo want to go to town, wo drag thru
the mud just like we always did and
if we want to go to town, maybe we
can and maybe we can't. Wo can if
it is cold enough to freeze the horns off
a brass monkey nnd the road up the
mountain gets frozen up tight nnd
then it. takes a pair of automobile
tires every time to try it. And if the
weather is worm enough to tempt
one to go out in the winter the bottom
drops out of the rond nnd you have to
double team and get out and push
nnd cuss and do nil sorts of things
liko they used to do in pioneer days.
Now, that's one "nigger" in our wood
pile, the south of the mountain. A
rope is only as strong as the weakest
point. We want the south of the
mountain macadamized so that we can
get the benefit of the rest of it. You
folks who love to tour over here in
summer, and we like to hnvo you do
it, just motor over one of these drip?
ping January days. Come right on
up to the top of the mountain on
"high" if you want to nnd then slide
down through the muck. You can't
coast, so you'd hotter keep on the
gas. No; don't come 'till summer
comes again, for if you do you'll nev?
er get out. You may slide in, but
you'll never slide out. You'll feel like
rats sliding into a trnp. And when
the bait is all gone you'll \>c starved.
Do you begin to glimpse tho situa?
tion V Here's Burke's Garden, benuti
ful Burke's Garden, the most isolated
community in the county, the most
populous rurnl area in the county, a
community of educated, cultured,
thinking, business people, with only
one way out, twelve miles to the rail?
road and county seat,?fifteen nnd
seventeen for most of tho people?
cheerfully pnying taxes and helping
to develop a great county, but handi?
capped in everything by bad roads.
The road from Tazewcll into tho Gar
(den may be called the arm of trans
? portation, the rond inside being the
1 fingers branching off from the palm
? of a hand. But tho arm is cut off at
! the wrist and the fingers are buried in
! mire. Drop figurative language and ?
' get down to facts. There are two t
'< miles of tho main rond, the old Wythe-1
' ville-Tazowell pike, four miles of the
, 1916.
road lending to tho eastward from tho
church, four and a half from tho
post-office to Walker's on tho Cores
road, throe miles from the mill to the
CSoso's and L&WSOll's, anil on the road
to Hland C. H., two miles of tho Litis
lane road, not ono of which has had
one dollar of bond money and that arc
just as they were a decade ago. Havo
we been patient about it'.' If you
were to see from six to seven feet of
Hob Moss steaming across tho pas
lures of mornings even before tho
frosty dawn made visible his impa?
tient breath ns he tries to catch a CD
or a wagon to get to Tuzowoll to a
good roads meeting, you'd probably
think we were impatient. Why does
your road commissioner tramp the
four milus before daylight across the
fields? Recnuse his own road is well
nigh impassible. If there was oc?
curring only now you might think
him impatient. Ilut as u matter of
fact, in all the three years since the
good roads movement first, started,
to say nothing of the years before
when both he and his public spirited
father unselfishly served the public,
not one dollar of bond issue money
has been spent to relieve the tedious
drag of four miles to even get an
even start to go to town or to the
station. And the same is true of the
Kellys and Hiram Stowora and all
the East end folks. Here's our direct
routes to the south and to the east, to
the adjoining counties where we do
three-fourths of our cattle trading,
ami where we have many friends and
much business interest, lying like
trails of Ihe pioneers, little better
than when first blazed through the
woods, while in and nut and around
our county towns whirr hundreds of
thoughtless motoring parlies. Is it
fair? Hut you say we cannot expect
a county to build roads for Hob Moss
or Joe Kelly or John Goco, Certainly
not, but when those names stand for
communities of- bard-warking handi?
capped people, ii Isn't selfishness, It
isn't even self-interest, to want, good
roads. It is community interest, frank,
open and laudible public spirit and
self protection, On the road leading
oir from the postofllco to go to Ceres
there are nineteen bind owners who
use that road for everything, and they
have not had the benefit of even a
dirt road appropriation. Now, we
have reached the day of opportunity
agnin. On next Saturday in the town
of Graham at twelve o'clock a masa
meeting of tho Clear Kork district
will bear the report of the commit?
tees on appropriation of funds to be
voted in the next bond issue election.
This report will embody the wisdom
of some le or twelve public spirited,
sensible men and they have used as
the basis of that report the estimates
made by the engineers and commis?
sioners for the other bond issue that
did not go around. Hurke's Garden
will frankly appeal to that committee
and to (he mass-meeting to regard
her needs and her rights and we be?
lieve they will. We cannot think that
any man or set of men in this great
progress-movement really mean to be
unfair. We are trying to look at
this matter here in Hurke's Garden
in a broad minded manner and at the
same lime we realize that self-preser?
vation is the first law of nature. We
are trying to work out some features
of the Community Idea here in
Hurke's Garden and we cant do it with
poor facilities for the Interpretation
of those two greatest words in the
life of community develpomoht, trans?
portation and communication.
Talk about Social Centers, the
Country Church, Co-oporativo Clubs,
and all those things that have pro?
jected the west years and years ahead
of provincial, self-satisfied counties
like Tazowelll No wonder we speed
on slowly. We light each other over
roads, telephones, etc., and while we
fight others pass on ahead. Let's
quit fighting and get down und push
and pull and make this thing go!
I'm for another bond issue wisely
and fairly spent and am willing to
give and lake in whatever degree of
cither is ncccssnry to get results.
And I believe this expresses tho at?
titude of the majority of citizens.
When the various communities of the
district, Hurke's Gnrden, Clear Kork,
Ulucstonc, Graham, Pocahontas, etc.,
meet at Graham next Saturday, (to?
morrow), I think it is going to lie an
open-minded, good humored bunch' of
fellows who are trying to find out the
right thing to do und who will have
the brains and grit to do it.

More Bonds
to be Issued
Jeffersonvillc District Votes Al?
most Unanimously For Anoth?
er Issue ? Changes in the
County Rond Laws.
Tho meeting advertised for lust
Saturday, to ttottlo by what manner
the monoy should bo raised fur thu
completion of tho roads in Jelferson
villo and Clear Fork districts, as orig?
inally outlined in tho previous bond
issue, and to recommend certain al?
terations in the county road law, wus
held in the Court House, nnd was one
of the most unthuslntsic of tho kind
ever held in the county.
Uy an almost, unanimous voto,
(only one dissenting voice), it was de?
cided by tho meet ill}; to hold another
I bond issue in Jeffersonvlllo district
ami lo complete the roads in those
sections of the county that were left
out before. A committee was ap?
pointed to go to work at once se?
curing petitions for presentation to
the Circuit. Court asking for the elec?
tion in tho near future. The follow?
ing are tho committoomon:
Ta/.ewell-? Dr. Isaac Pierce.
North Ta/.ewell?J. 1). Poory.
Crockett's Cove?Joe Kiley.
Dry Fork?Goorgo Lambert.
Gap Store?C. P. Ilnrmnn.
Henlmw It. P. Iliiclinnan.
Thompson Valley?Sam Six.
Poor Valley- W. T. Corall.
These gent leinen ni e charged with
thu duly of circulating petitions ut
their various precincts and securing a
sufficient number of signatures in or?
der that the Judge of the Circuit
Court may call an election.
Another important resolution was
adopted, lixine; the levy for the up?
keep of macadam roads at 2Gc on tho
hundred dollars, and for the upkeep
of dirt roads, 35c on the hundred dol?
lars, maximum. It. was understood
that the Supervisors would not luy
these levies to the maximum amount
lltoH if was absolutely necessary for
the proper maintenance of the roads.
It. was also the opinion of a major?
ity of the liudiotlcu that the rend com?
missioners should still bo appointed
by the Supervisor;! us heretofore. An
effort was made to have the matter
placed in (he hands of the court.
Peel Ilnrmnn, nf North Ta'/.owoll,
was one of the leading spirit:', in the
meeting, p.lid It was upon bis motion
Hint the Supervisor:-, were rc-invented
with the power to appoint rm.d com?
missioners,
An effort wus made to have the
road law changed hi reference to
condemnation of land for righto-of
way, lo give tho complainant an op?
portunity lo appeal lo tho circuit
court, whereas, an the matter now
Stands there is no appeal from the
decision of I lie local road commission?
ers, except, to tho Supervisors, and
their opinion in the matter is final.
Mr. Henry tiowen, of Willen:; Mills,
in support of the present method of
securing new rlghto-of-way for road,
cited the North Carolina law, which
gives the road authorities t'.e right
to build Hie road where they think it
ought to be and after the road is com?
pleted, the damages, if any, are as?
sessed.
Chairman I). B. Daniels was over?
whelmed by molions of various kinds,
it npeariug that, nearly everybody had
some kind of a motion to make.
Henry Galloway, of Graham, who
became weary of listening at motions,
moved that the meeting get down to
business and take up the question of
whether bonds should be issued for
road work. His suggestion was im?
mediately adopted, and the voto was
taken as to whether Jeffersonvlllo
district should issue bonds for the
completion of certain roads, which will
be given as soon as decided upon, The
amount of the bond issue in tho Jef
fersonvillo will be determined lntor.
The amount will not be over .$100,000,
and maybe not an amount that large,
if it is developed that by operation
of the new tax law the district is re?
stricted in issuing bonds to that
amount
Clear Pork district is in much bet?
ter shape in that respect, it being pos?
sible to issue several hundred thous?
and dollars more in that district. It
was brought out in the discussion of
the Clear Pork district bond issue,
that the district was still indebted
for road building to contractors and
others to the amount of $12,000.00,
which would have to be poid from any
future bond issue.
Tho citizens of Clour Fork district
have been called lo meet in Graham
tomorrow, where they will decide on
the amount they will endeavor to is?
sue. It is feard that the meeting in
Graham will not bo as harmonious
in so far as a bond issue is concern?
ed as the meeting here lnst Saturday.
In rcferenco to the legality of is?
suing more bonds in the Jeffersonville
district, Dr. Isnae Pierce read a let
tetr from Attorney General Pollard,
which threw some light on tho ques?
tion. It seems to be the opinion of
a number of the lawyers that the dis?
trict can still issue some $80,000 in
bonds.
