BUILD HIGHWAY
WITH CONVICTS
State Has Sent Equipment to
Grangeville and Prison Men
Will Come Soon as Work
Can Be Prosecuted.
Construction work on the north
and south highway will be com
menced in this county between
Whitebird and Lucile as soon as
the weather conditions will per
mit. This is the report made by
State Highway Engineer E. M.
Booth, who has been in confer
ence with the county commission
ers and citizens who are interest
ed in the working of convicts on
the state road.
The equipment for the convict
camp, the tools and supplies are
now in Grangeville and will be
moved to Whitebird within the
next few days to be stored until
the weather conditions are favor
able for the beginning of con
struction work along the river.
Mr. Booth stated the Grangeville
and Whitebird people expect the
work can be commenced the lat
ter part of the month.
Engineer Booth explained the
construction work on the high
way between Whitebird and
Lucile will consist largely of im
provements to the present road.
Entire Northwest Suffers
From Severe Storms
After one of the coldest Jan-1
uarys experienced in the Inland
Empire in more than thirty
years, February was ushered in
with a big snowstorm which con
tinued almost without cessation
the past three days and is still at
it. The snow is piled up to a
depth of almost thirty inches on
the level on Camas prairie and is
much deeper in the mountains,
while in places it is drifted over
the fences and as high as the
roofs of the smaller buildings.
The snow is very light but is so
deep that it is rapidly becoming
a serious menace to travel of any
kind, while a little wind would
pile it up in the railroad cuts in
such a manner as to completely
block traffic for an indefinite
period. The extreme weather has
caused very little trouble here on
the prairie but over in the range
country along the Salmon and
Snake rivers the deep snow is
rapidly becoming a serious prob
lem to the stock men and will oc
casion serious losses unless mild
er weather comes to remove the
snow and allow the cattle to get
down again to the grass below.
The deep snow that covers the
range at present makes it im
possible for the cattle to get a
particle of feed and the stockmen
are forced to feed their herds
every day. The larger firms are
well prepared to do this and will
not suffer unless the sm w lays
on the ground long enough to
exhaust their feed supply, but
Our Roll of Honor

At points the road must be rais
ed above the high water mark,
at other points the grade must
be reduced and in other places
the bluffs must be blown away
to reduce the curvature and
eliminate the danger now exist
ing at such places. It is planned
to expend at least $10,000 in this
construction work and one-half
of the sum will be provided by
Idaho county, while the remain
der of the fund will be provided by
the state. It is also expected
the settlers along the river will
make subscriptions to the fund,
as much interest has been arous
ed in the proposed improvement
and a number of the Salmon
river residents were at Grange
ville to confer with Mr. Booth
during his recent visit there.
The plan 3 provide for bringing
40 or 50 honor convicts to the
Salmon river camp. Foremen of
the work will be in charge of the
party but no firearms are allow
ed in the camp and the men are
entirely 8n their honor from the
time they leave the penitentiary
at Boise until they return. It is
expected the convicts will be
transported from Boise t o
Grangeville by train and an over
land trip to the Salmon river will
be made from Grangeville.
The camp and its equipment is
identical with that of any con
struction outfit and to an observ
er there will be nothing by which
the camp and the» men could be
identified as being from the state
penal institution.
the smaller growers are not so
well supplied with feed and no
doubt many of them have just
about exhausted their supply by
this time. As it is almost im
possible to get the cattle to feed
or vice versa it will not take long
to seriously cripple many of the
smaller stockmen if the present
weather continues.
Word came out this week from
a sheepman over on the Oregon
side of Snake river stating that
he had about two thousand head
of sheep there without a particle
of feed and the snow was almost
two feet deep. The man tele
phoned to Lewiston to have the
gasoline launch bring up a load
of feed but as Snake river is
blockaded with ice jams at sever
al points it was impossible for
the boat to get through and the
sheep will probably starve.
The central Idaho section is
not the only part of the north
west subject to these weather
conditions, for Lewiston has al
most two feet of snow, Portland
has a foot, and the snowfall in
the Cascades is enormous. Se
attle and other coast cities are
also receiving their share of
snow, while California is being
visited by heavy rains and sever
al sections have been severely
damaged by floods. Altogether,
the Pacific slope seems to be re
ceiving the limit from the weath
er dispenser and what is yet to
come before spring arrives time
alone will tell.
The New York Minstrels will
appear here tonight at the K. C.
hall. They are advertised to give
a street concert at noon but ow
ing to coming in on the evening
train the concert will be given on
the street in the evening before
the show opens.

County Commissioners Favor
Some Radical Changes
Boise, Jan. 28.—The delegates
to the seventh annual convention
of the county commissioners' as
sociation of Idaho put in busy
days discussing the problems
with which they have to deal and
framing suggestions for legisla
tive relief. They know what they
wanted and they succeeded in
compressing their requirements in
concrete form. Each suggestion
was carefully threshed out and
expressed the will of the conven
tion. The resolutions adopted are
as follows:
We recommend the organiza
tion of the state tax association,
under the supervision of the de
partment of political science in
the University of Idaho, and
pledge our support and coopera
tion to it for the purpose of ar
riving at a solution of the prob
lems of taxation in this state.
We favor the creation by leg
islative enactment of a state bu
reau of accounts for the purpose
of installing a uniform system of
accounting, auditing and report
ing in all governmental units
within the state.
We favor a uniform budget
system for all counties in the
state; and pending the creation
of a state bureau of accounts, we
recommend that a committee of
the convention be appointed with
instructions to devise a suggested
form for a budget; and that said
committee be instructed to confer
and cooperate in devising such
form with the state examiner and
with the officers or a committee
of the state tax association.
We favor the reorganization of
county government for. the pur
pose of ^rendering it a more effi
cient business unit. As an initial
step in such'organization we favor
ah amendment to the constitution
providing that the term of county
commissioners be extended to six
Calico Ball a Howling Success
The "Calico Ball" given Tues
day evening at the K. of C- hall
by the local order Knights of
Columbus was one of the most
enjoyable affairs of the season
and was quite largely attended.
The dance was an invitation af
fair, the invitations being sent to
the members of the order and
others secured by them for their
friends. Plain clothes were the
order of the day and bib overalls
and calico dresses were largely
in evidence, the finer sort of
raiment being strictly taboo.
Dancing started promptly at
eight o'clock and the large hall
was soon filled to full capacity
with merry dancers, young and
old, who disported themselves in
the good old fashioned way when
everyone went for a good time
and "style" was a forgotten
quantity. Quadrilles were as
popular as the waltz and two-step
and the older folks set a pace
that the younger people found
hard to travel. At midnight the
dancers repaired to the council
chamber upstairs where their
lunches were spread on tables
provided for the occasion and hot
coffee and cream was furnished
by the council. Afterward danc
ing again held sway with una
bated fervor and the merry crowd
did not disperse until about the
hour of four a. m. Quite a num
ber of people were present from
neighboring towns and all pres
ent join in saying the dance was
one of the most enjoyable ever
given here. Music for the occa
sion was furnished by the popular
Reubens orchestra.

years, and that the bill be so
drawn that one commissioner be
elected every two years and that
all salaries and bills may be paid
monthly.
We favor amending the present
revenue law so as to permit coun
ties to place their finances upon
a cash basis. We particularly
recommend that the fiscal year
be made to conform to the tax
year; that the present system of
payment of taxes in two install
ments either be abolished, or, if
retained, that it be so amended
that both installments shall be
paid in the same year for which
tne taxes are levied. For the pur
pose of enabling counties to
change from a credit to a cash
basis, we favor legislation author
izing a small levy to create a sink
ing fund, which will gradually
and over a series of years permit
such change of financial basis to
be made.^

lars were spent by the Panama

Resolved, that the county com
missioners' association of Idaho,
assembled in convention at Boise,
Idaho, do recommend and urge
that the moving picture films ad
vertising the resources of Idaho,
upon the ceasing of the Panama
Pacific International exposition
commission of Idaho, be placed
in charge of the state board of
education to be used to advertise
the state of Idahö and for educa
tional purposes.
We favor the tract index sys

installed in each county.
North-South Railroad Hope
Boise, Jan. 28. —A deal may be
consummated at once for build
ing the north and kouth railroad
in this state from New Meadows
to Lewiston, and to close it, either
Jerome J. Day, state senator and
millionaire mine owner of the
Coeur d'Alênes, or Aaron Parker
of Grangeville, member of the
railroad commission, will leave
immediately for Chicago.
Announcement to this effect
was made here last night by
Governor Alexander on receipt
of a telegram from an engineer
who last summer quietly investi
gated the route and tonnage a
vailable.
From Chicago this engineer
telegraphed the governor as fol
lows:
"Can you have parties inter
ested in north and south railroad
project come to Chicago immedi
ately to close contract financing
construction and to whom repre
sentatives of the syndicate, now
here temporarily, will submit
ample evidence of ability to carry
project through? This is con
sidered unusual opportunity."
Aged Indian Woman Dies
Mrs. Thomas Wilson, an aged
Indian woman well past her 90th
mile stone, died last night at her
home. In her youth, her husband
and herself, who were Snake In
dians, were captured by the Nez
Perces and were held as slaves
by that tribe while the Nez
Perces were in their savage state.
But with the coming of the mis
sionary this was done away with
and Mr. Wilson and his wffe re
mained here to finish their days.

The Lewiston Mercantile Co.
last week placed an order for
nine full carloads of fruit jars
for the season of 1916. This is
perhaps the largest order ever
placed by this company and its
size was due to the rapid advance
in the price of zinc jar caps, due
to the demand caused for that
metal since the opening of the
European war.
The'farmers rochdale company
at Nezperce, assisted by the bus

A black fox was bagged last
week by Chas. Cromwell near
Grinell station in the Palouse
hills. The animal took refuge
under an old abandoned, house
where it was shot by Mr. Crom
well. The pelt of the animal
killed is valued at approximately
$1500, due to the scarcity of black
as
foxes. The other two foxes start
ed by the Palouse hunter are sti.l
at large. It is said to be difficult
to account for their presence in
that locality, but it is supposed
that they drifted down out of the
mountains before the heavy snow
storms.
Is Well Pleased With Silo
Fred Ledford, who has been
working for James Wright south
of town for the past year and is
caring for the farm this winter
while Mr. Wright and family are
enjoying life in California, drop
ped in Saturday for a few min
utes' chat and stated that they
were getting very satisfactory
results from their silo this winter.
The silo was erected last summer
and was filled with field peas and
finished out with wheat hay.
Mr. Ledford says the ensilage is
highly appreciated by the hogs
and chickens as well as the dairy
cows, and that the latter picked
up wonderfully in their milk and
cream production after being fed
a silage ration along with their
other feed. While no record was
kept of this increase Mr. Ledford
says it was a material one and
was due entirely to the silage
ration. Mr. Ledford is familiar
with the silo from experience
gained in eastern states and says
that the wooden silo is about as
good as any other jcind but pre
fers corn as an ensilage crop be
cause of its superiojr feeding value
and that it is far lèss difficult to
convert into first class ensilage
than some of thé other crops
grown for this purpose. While
peas and oats make fine ensilage
if well packed, whether used sep
arately or together, the difficulty
is to get them packed sufficiently
tight in the silo to prevent con
siderable spoilage from moulding,
while corn, owing to its greater
weight, packs easily and is very
free from spoilage.'

January a Record Breaker
January was a record breaking
month in the weather line for
this part of Idaho, according to
the records kept at St. Michael's
Monastery west of town, all rec
ords for the past thirty years
having been broken, and that
period of time may elapse again
before the present record is equal
led or even nearly approached.
According to the government rec
ord kept at the monastery the
maximum temperature for the
month was 43 degrees on the 23d,
and the minimum 7 degrees be
low zero on the 29th. The total
snowfall for the month amounted
to 20.6 inches.
While the instruments at the
monastery did not record nearly
as low temperature as was record
ed at this place, and . at many
points on the prairie, the records
show a temperature of-zero and
lower for eleven days dut of the
month, and the average temper
ature for the entire month was
only 16 degrees above zero.
