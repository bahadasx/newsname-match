Some Interesting Old Papers.
The Lexington Historical So
ciety is in receipt of a bundle of
local papers printed in Lexington
between the years 18G0 and
18G8, the gift of Mr. Frank Bow
man. Many of the papers are of
far more than ordinary interest
and value, especially because the
society's files are incomplete be
tween I860 and 18GG. The gen
eral public ought to make a
habit of turning over all such
original sources of local history
to the society for preservation.
It may be too late in a few
years.
