SUPERVISORS DID RIGHT
JiiricA Minor FtafusA Mandamus to
Compel Snbmission of Local Op
tlon Question.
In a most clear and comprehensive
opinion filed Thursday morning Judge
Miner In the circuit court refused the
petition of L. G. Heyer for a writ of
mandamus to compel the board of
supervisors to re-convene and submit
the local option question to a vote in
April 1916.
Judge Miner holds that the petitions
presented did not comply with the law's
requirements in the fifth ward of Owos
so and New Haven township. With
these eliminated there were not suffi
cient names to compel the submission.

Basket Ball.
The basket ball game at the high
school Friday was an interesting con
test. The opposing team, the Lansing
high school five, was victorious, the
final score being 26 to 23. At the end
of the first half the score was 19 to 18
in favor of Owosso.
A preliminary game between two
girls teams from the high school called
the "Reds" and "Blues" resulted in a
victory for tne "Red" side, the score
being 6 to 4.
The girls will play Laingsburg here
Friday night and the high school boys
team will play at Grand Ledge.
The Owosso high school girls' basket
ball team defeated the Eaton Rapids
team Friday night in a particularly
fast game by a score of 11 to 8.
Team work exemplified by the visi
tors, accounted for the result. At the
end of the first half the score was 5 to
5. Owosso accelerated the pace and
clearly outplayed their opponents in
the second period.
The Woman's Club.
At the Woman's club meeting held at
the club rooms the subject of the after
noon was "The Rivers of the United
States" and papers were read by Mea-
dames G. E. Pardee, F. A. Watts and
F. Miner, - Mrs. Pardee gave a vivid
description of the Mississippi and Colo
rado rivers, Mrs. Watts r read an , in'
teresting paper on the St Lawrence
and Ohio rivers and Mrs. Miner told of
the Hudson and St. Mary's rivers.
A communication was read from Mrs.
D. D. Ashbaugh, president of the state
federated clubs, stating that Mrs. Frank
Greenman of this city had been ap
pointed chairman of the state educa
tional department of rural schools.
The appointment places Mrs. Green
man on the state board. Members of
the club are gratified by the honor that
thus comes to one of their number.
Month of New Weather Reoords.
January, 1916, will likely be remem
bered for some years to come as the
one month where there was only one
clear day and also as a month of near
summer warmth, according to the
monthly weather summary issued yes
terday by local Meteorologist F. H.
Coleman of the weather bureau. On
just one day, January 7, the automatic
instruments in the weather bureau
office at the Arthur Hill Trade school
registered "clear," showing a maximum
of 8.7 hours of sunshine. Of the other
days in the month there were 13 when
the instruments failed to show any trace
of sunshine. The temperature was also
more than unusual, showing an average
for the month of 28 degrees just one
degree warmer than the record break
ing January of 1913. The average tem
perature for the month last year was 20
degrees. The highest mark reached by
the mercury during the month was 62
degrees on the 27th and the lowest was
on the 17th. The normal average
temperature for January is 22.5 degrees.
Although the temperature for the
month was warm and the weather
cloudy, the rainfall was only .25 of an
inch above the normal of 2.26 inches.
There was 1.8 inches of snow, which
fell during the month. The prevailing
direction of the wind during the month
was south, with a total movement of
,809 miles, making an average hourly
velocity of 18 2 miles. The highest
mark reached by the wind was a veloc
ity of 40 miles per honr on the 5th.
The weather chart showed eight partly
cloudy days, 23 cloudy and 15 on which
there was at least .01 of an inch of rain
fall. Saginaw Courier-Herald.

People in this city have been receiv
ing postal cards headed "Ancient
Prayer." It is mentioned that the one
receiving a card should rewrite and
address to nine other persons, and im
plying that unless this was done mis
fortune would befall them. Some per
sons nave oeen made exceedingly
nervous over the prediction. No doubt
the intent in first sending the cards was
to do a religions act, but as to the pre
diction of evil, it is bosh and should not
be considered.
WHO WILL BUILD HOUSES?
- ! OWOSSO Needs HOIKS For
Additions
Men at Malleables Co. Plant
Canvas of City Fails to Show Twenty
five Suitable Vacant Quarters.
After a careful canvass, the American
Malleables Company is unable to find
houses which may be rented by the
men whom they are to employ in the
new addition to the plant. E O. Dewey
reported the matter to the Improve
ment Association at the Tuesday noon
meeting and Vice-President Blagdon
stated the needs of the new company
They want to bring in families so that
the men will remain in their employ
and want suitable homes for them
which will rent for from 10 to f 15 a
month.
Superintendent J. B. Cary stated that
after a careful canvass, eliminating
the high rent houses and a few which
had prohibitive restrictions, there were
less than 25 houses available and prob
ably half of these could not be secured.
People who have anything to rent
that might be available should report
to Mr. Cary at the Malleables office.
E. 0. Dewey and Mayor De Young are
the Association's committee, which will
endeavor to interest citizens to construct
the houses needed.

Plan to Build New Building Too Ex

Mayor James De Young. Wednes
day gave out an interview in which
he quoted facts and figures regard
ing the two tentative plans the com
mission has for motorizing the fire
department. One plan calls for cen
tralization and motorization of the
department, while the other calls on
ly for the motorization. The mayor
favors the first plan. The executive
said:
Considers Two Plans. '
"The commission has under con

and make it possible to bring the of- merce or otherwise brought within the
flees of the city clerk and treasurer
on the ground floor; furthermore, it
would also leave more room for the
police department, justice court and
commissioners' offices. The sheds ln
the rear of the city hall could be
used for the storage of street ma
chinery and heavy tools. Tae
clerks and treasurers offices could
be used for work shop purposes, thus
saving $400 per year which is now
paid for rent.
The cost of this plan would be as
follows:

who were present:
Whereas, The use of the telephone

Killing of Birds Tree Destruction.
"Children of today will live to see
the time when every tree and shrub in
America will have been destroyed by
insects unless the slaughter of birds is
done away with," said Col. Q. O.
BhieHs of New York city, in delivering
an illustrated lecture at South High
school building Tuesday evening, on
"Wild Animals and Birds."
"Game laws and game wardens have
proven to be inefficient to stop the
ruthless killing of our feathered friends.
The only solution of the problem is for
property owners to see that the trespass
law is enforced."
Colonel Shields showed a number of
views portraying bird and animal life,
and told of the great nnmber of insects
whlcn different species of birds kill
each year. He also pointed to the valne
of birds in the eating of weed seeds.

No Township, City or Village Caucus
Legal in Michigan If Held Later
Than Monday, March 13, 1916
The people of this state, by constitu
tional am end went, voted that traveling
salesman who could not be at their
places of residence on election day
should have the right to vote reverthe
lees, aud provided that official ballots
should be mailed to them in time so
that they could mark them and return
them to the city, village, township or
county clerk in time for delivery to the
election boards on election day.
Agreeable to this amendment, which
the voters of the state enacted, the last
legisliture provided the law for making
it operative. The new law provides
that any traveling salesman who' will
not be at his place of residence on elec
tion day, may apply to the city, village
or township clerk for an official ballot
to be sent him at an address he may
give. The clerk to whom the applica
tion is made must forward by regis
tered letter to the traveling salesman
who applies for an official ballot in
time so the recipient can mark it and
have it returned by registered letter to
the clerk early enough so the clerk may
file it on election day with the election
board where the traveling salesman may
resida.
To enable all this to be done, it is
necessary to have nominations made

EXPERIMENT
BRINGS SUCCESS
Edison Now Allows Disc Record
Offered to Publio Under
His Name.
The Edison Diamond Disc. Phono
graph marks the attainment of an idehl
by a man whose ideals are many years
in advance of the age in which he lives.
In 1877 Mr. Edison invented the phono
graph; one year later he patented the
disc phonograph. This may come as a
surprise for sot until now has the great
inventor permitted a disc phonograph
to be offered to the public in bis name.
The New Edison Diamond Disc Phono
graph, therefore, represents thirty-five
years of experimenting to perfectly
reproduce sound. A visit to the store of
the Shattnck Music House, one of the
finest in Michigan, and yon will be
wonderfully impreseed at the demon
stration you will see there. After you
have heard the Edison Diamond Disc
you do not need be told that it is
different from all other sound repro
ducing instruments. Yonr own appre
ciation of real music will enable you to
recognize its grand superior, musical
qualities.
The hardness of the Edison disc is a
very noticable characteristic. It being
many times harder than the substance
of which other discs are made, being a
new chemical material. This hardness
insures the life of the indentations so
that the minntest sounds once recorded
are not destroyed by use.
The fineness of the grooves is another
featnre. An Edison disc is cut 150
threads to the inch, other discs gener
ally 75 or 80 to the inch.
The lie of the record is protected not
only by the thickness, its hardness, its
toughness, but by a number of devices
which the Shattuck Music He use will
gladly explain to persons interested in
this wonderful invention.
Toe Edison Diamond Disc Phono
graph, the instrument that plays this
wonderful record, is also the culmi
nation of many years of work and
experience.
It has many wonderful
features which cannot be enumerated,
and ftnyne interested in invention or
0nl7f appreciate this instru-
went uy seeing u bqu uaviug lis
mechanism explained.

Post will fly over the new armory for

and ballots printed much earlier than
heretofore. Therefore the legislature
amended the election law so that all
caucuses, conventions or primary elec
tions for nominating candidates for
any office whatever MUST BE HELD
AT LEAST 20 DAYS BEFORE
ELECTION, AND THE BALLOTS
l-OR EVERY ELECTION MUST BE
PRINTED AT LEAST. 12 DAYS BE
FORE ELECTION
Township, village, city and county
committees should note the provisions
of the new law, and call all party cau
cuses in townships, villages and in this
city nut later than 20 days previous to
the spring election and the ticket0 for
the election must be printed not later
than 12 days before election.
This new law makes no change in
time or dates of registration. These
can be held at the times they have been
heretofore.
It will be well for all interested to
study this new law, and be prepared to
follow its provisions. The time will be
much earlier than caucuses have been
held heretofore; but the new law is
mandatory on that part so that no town
ship or city caucus can be legal thia
year which is held later than Monday,
March IB. 1916.

one of the richest in what It has to offer
astronomically.
1. In the first place the extra day in
this month, which constitutes the en
tire year "leap year," provides us with
a calendar different from any enjoyed
since the centennial year, 1876, forty
years ago; and different from any that
will follow for twenty-eight yeara
longer, when 1944 will have begun.
This is a leap year beginning on Satur
day, containing S3 Saturdays and 53
Sundays, such as no person under 40
years of age ever knew before, and such
as possibly a very few will see again
repeated in the millenlal year, 2.00084
years hence.
SUN ECLIPSE FEB. 3.
2. The 3rd of February brings as
a total eclipse of the sun, visable as a
partial eclipse, in the morning hours,
all over the United States, Canada and
the northern part of South America.
The path of totality, perhaps, 500 miles
wide, lies mostly on the sea, but runs
across Colombia, south and east of Pan
ama. Though the eclipse will be only
partial with ns, it will be well worth
seeing, the eyes being carefully pro
tected by well smoked glass. The black
disc of the moon will be plainly visible,
and its progress across the sun's face
full of interest. For New York the
eclipse begins at 10:53 and ends at 12:45;
for Chicago, 0:10 and 11:03; for Denver,
7:41 and 9:14.
3. A beautiful conjunction of the
moon with brilliant Venus occurs on
the 6th, and the two bodies may be seen
together in the west both the 5th and
the 6th shortly after sunset.
4 A beautiful conjunction of the
moon with only Jess brilliant Jnpiter -
occurs on the 7th, the two bodies seen
together in the west, as darkness comer,
on both the 6th and the 7tb. The ma .
jestic advance of the lunar crescent
past these two most glorious orbs should
be carefully watched in the early even
ings of the 5th, 6th and 7th.
WE'LL CALL ON MARS.
5. The planet Mars, now rising in
the east, with its lurid hue, early in
the evening, will come to "opposition"
at 2 a. m. on the 10th. This term
means opposite the sun, as seen from
the earth; and, as the earth's path is
next inside that of Mars, opposition
brings the two planets side by side, and
hence nearest each other; the actual,
ueitrest approach occurs the day be
fore the opposition. It, is, however,
further from the earth's path to Mars'
path at some points than at others; and
so It happens that, at this opposition,
Mars is distant about 60,000,000 miles,
whereas sometimes he approaches as
near as 35,000,000 mile. Even so, Mars,
the supposedly inhabited planet, will
be big and bright, a conspicuous figure
