THREE DAYS 10
Charles Lindstrom, logging fore
man for the Saginaw & Manistee Co.,
came in Tuesday evening from Belle
mont. The big snows have completely put
them out of the logging business for
this winter, says Lindstrom. From
their camp to Bellemont ia one grand
wilderness of snow varying from four
to eight feet? deep. "For the past
three days we have been bucking the
road through fiom camp with a gang
of men and threo big logging teams,
and just got into Bellemont from our
camp seventeen miles out Tuesday
night. It was the wort combination
I have ever been up against. Under
neath the snow is a formation of ice
and water and when the snow was
shoveled away, it was all the big
teams could do to pull though this.
Teams were changed into relays,
using a fresh team when the leaders
were worn out. There was no way
out of it as the camps had run out of
meat of all kinds with but very little
other food left in camp. The continual
storm was more than any one looked
for and it caught us unprepared for a
full month's advance supplies. The
camps will shut down, of course, as
there is no possible chance of turning
a wheel until the snow goes off. The
logging road is completely blocked
ana it would cost at least $20,000 to
clear it enough to get an engine over
it, ice is from four to six inches thick
over some parts of it" Foreman Fred
Reno is bringing in the horses which
will be shipped to Phoenix to be put
onto pasture until they can be used
again next spring.
ASKS SCHOOL TEACHERS
TO HELP PROTECT BIRDS
The following communication, sent
out by the Federal Game Warden of
New Mexico to all of the school
teachers of New Mcxicp, will no
doubt be of particular interest to the
lovers of the birds in Arizona.
To the school teachers of New
Mexico:
The purpose of this letter is to
awaken your interest and enlist your
cooperation in the protection of the
migratory and insectivorous birds of
your state. When you realize that
unless active measures are taken and
assistance rendered by the people, ex-
tinction threatens many valuable spe
cies, the importance of the subject will
be plain. It has been shown that
birds save the farmer millions of dol
lars each year, and that the toll they
exact in return for their services is
trifling. Scarcely less important to
mankind than the practical value of
birds is their esthetic value, since
without their bright plumage and
beautiful songs the world would be
far less attractive.
Until recently large numbers of
birds, including many insectivorous
species, have been destroyed for mili-
nery purposes. Many others fall vic
tim to the small boy with the 22-cali-ier
rifle, which is too often employed
every evening and Saturday on every
living bird within range, including
song-birds. You can assist in the good
work by giving a few moments occa
sionally to the instruction of your
pupils in the value of insectivorous
and migratory birds, teaching them
their value both from the practical
and esthetic standpoints. If you can
induce them to actively assist in the
work by putting up bird houses and
by feeding hungry birds, especially in
winter, a long step will have been
taken in their education. Today the
trend of the American people is to
ward the conservation of our natural
resources. The protection of birds is
in line with the conservation principle
and is indeed a very important part
of it. Your efforts in this direction
will be greatly appreciated, and any
data that will ssist you in in the work
will bo cheerfully furnished. Publi
ctlons that bear directly on the sub
ject may be. had by applying to the
Bureau of Biological Survey, Depart
ment of Agriculture, Washington, D.
C. Very truly yours,
R. B. CRAIG,
Federal Warden.
Nackard Breaks Ankle
K. J. Nackard, proprietor of the
New York store on Railroad avenue,
fell from the wooden awning late last
week Thursday afternoon while shov
eling off the snow, breaking his ankle
and receiving other bruises from the
fall.
FOREST SERVICE TELLS
r AILS GAME SUPPLY
In commenting on the figures re
cently published showing the dwind
ling game-supply of Arizona and New
Mexico, Forest olticers say that the
situation is so serious as to necessi
tate immediate and decisive action
along the following lines:
First, the prompt enactment of the
Chamberlain-Hayden Bill now before
Congress embodying the Hornaday
Flan for a system of Game Refuges,
pioviding places where game can
breed unmolested and where no hunt
ing is allowed
Second, the organization of Game
Protective Associations throughout
the Southwest to crystalizc and make
effective public sontiment in favor of
game protection. Theso associations
arc steadily growing in New Mexico,
nctive organizations existing at Toas,
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Magdalena,
and Sijver City.
Third, a vigorous campaign, car
ried on jointly by the State Game
Wardens, the Game Protective 'Asso
ciations, and the Forest Service, for
the absolute enforcement of the game
laws.
Fourth, a vigorous campaign of
public education carried on by the
same three agencies, which will teach
people the value of game, the neces
sity for game conservation, and the
fact, that under present conditions,
tnc breaking1 of the game law, instead
r De,nff a sPrt'nff chance rcprehen
sibie only when detected, is
an act
unworthy of a good citizen.
.
The National Forests, of Arizona
nnd Ncw Mexico, it is said, instead of
(yielding thousands of deer and turkey
each vcar' 0UKht to yie,(1 tens of
I thousands, but they will never do so
I un'l an adequate breeding stock has
been restored by vigorous action along
I the lines indicated.
DERAILMENT SMASHES
STANDPIPE AT BELLEMONT
A derailment and a smashed stand
pipe at Bellemont last week Thursday
added to the general pleasantness of
the day in the big snow for trainmen.
The deep snow caused the derailment
and the derailed cars took it out on
the standpipe, the standpipe spilled
water all over the right of way; the
snow froze up at the perdicament and
there you are, the trainmen had to
stand the blunt of the trouble.
Fred Russell for Street Commissioner
Fred Russell has thrown his hat in
e .nB ,an" " MK1"S "e SUnpon 01
i ilia iiicima iui uiu ujiilu ui Bbiuub tuiu-
missioncr at the coming city election.
The office of street commissioner will
be a very important one during the
coming year if the'down town district
is paved as now seems very probable
and it will require a good man to fill
the place. Russell is a Russell by
name and a rustler by nature. He is
well equipped for the work with
teams and has a good knowledge of
the work that will be required of him.
He has many friends who will be
found boosting his candidacy from
now until the polls close next May,
believing that no better selection
could be made for the place.
If elected ho promises to be on the
job in all parts of the city with an
earnest effort to make the streets of
the city something to be proud of .be
fore his term of office expires.
Overland Tourists Were
Snowbound Without
Food
A party of overland tourists con
sisting of two men and their wives
were snowed in east of Flagstaff in
the Doncy Park country last week,
with an outfit of burros and horses
and were unable to make their way
into Flagstaff. County Engineer W.
H. Power sent out a relief party after
them and was in hopes of locating
them in a ranch housp temporarily.
They seemed to have struck this sec
tion at about the middle of the two
big storms and were practically with
out food. Their burros were lost during
the storm and the travelers were in a
hard way until their predicament was
reported by a rancher who had made
it across country to the railroad and
came into Flagstaff by rail.
Prominent Arizonana Visits District
Oatman received a visit early this
week from some of the wealthiest adn
most prominent men in the state. In
the party were George Babbitt, his
son, Herbert, Charles Prochnow, Fred
Hensing and M. J. Aubineau, all of
Flagstaff. The party spent several
days examining the different mining
properties of note and expressed
themselves as being well pleased with
the future of the district. Oatman

HAS THERE ANYBODY
HERE SEEN KELLY?
Mrs. James Kelly, of Flagstaff, Ari
zona, is in the city looking fpr 'friend
husband. If there is anybody hero
that has seen Kelly they arc request
ed to convey what information they
have to Mrs. Kelly at the Los Angeles
rooming house.
Mrs. Kelly came to Albuquerque
two or three days ago from Flagstaff
expecting to be met at the train by
her husband, who had left Flagstaff
shortly before on account of the clos
ing of the mines where he was work
ing. Kelly didn't show up at the train
and his wife has not been able to lo
cate him since. She is therefore
alarmed for his safety and has asked
the newspapers to assist in getting in
formation about him.
Kelly is described as a large man
with a broken nose who, when last
seen, were a black fur cap. He is a
miner by trade. Mrs. Kelly says that
he sometimes goes to saloons, but,
that she has his word for it that he
never drinks on such occasions. He
can neither read or write. It is pre
sumed that he was looking for work
when he arrived in Albuquerque.
Albuquerque Journal.
Mrs. Kelly says she is very sick and
without cither a husband or money.
She wants him immediately. She says
he was last heard of in Gallup.
Ground Hog Was Shadowed
If the ground hog poked his nose
out. of the ground Wednesday he
could plainly see his shadow laying
thick in the snow beside him, conse
quently we arc entitled to six more
weeks of winter weather. We have
snow enough on the ground to last
over six weeks and we didn't need the
durned shoat to come out to make any
demonstration. We do not know just
who invented "ground hog day" but
we are confident that it is not legal
as it is not mentioned among the legal
holidays in the Arizona statutes.
FOREST SERVICE NEWS NOTES
Supervisor Jno. D. Guthrie, who has
been in Albuquerque for the past two
weeks, is expected back in Flagstaff
the first part of the coming week.
Ranger Morse reports that flood
conditions washed out a majority of
the irrigations ditches and dams in
the vicinity of his station on Beaver
Creek.
Ranger Brown reports an unusually
large number of birds starved to
death as a result of the unusual snow
fall in the vicinity of Camp Verde.
Theiquail resorted to eating misletoe
berries and in this way were able to
survive the famine.
Supervisor Greene of the Tusayan
National Forest together with Ranger
Kimball skeed up to the top of Bill
Williams Mountain on Tuesday of this
week. On the way up they repaired
the telephone line, which in places
was buried to a depth of six feet in
snow. It was necessary to dig down
at least eight feet to enter the look
out cabin from which location they
talked to the local Forest Supervisor's
office.
Ranger Maxwell in returning from
Winslow to his station at Bly, thirty
seven miles southwest of Winslow,
experienced difficulties at the Jacks
Canyon crossing where he was held
up for three days by the high waters.
He finally managed to cross the
stream by swimming his team. Be
fore the phone line went out of com
mision, the snow fall in the vicinity
of his station compared very favor
ably with that of Flagstaff.

Remarkable Change on Saturn
January 8, 191G
Recent observations of Saturn show
a remarkable change in the color and
brightness of the planet's ball which
is now of a brickred tint all over and
strikingly darker than the rinirs.
1 TRAINS RUN DISPITE
WASHOUTS, RAINS AND SNOW
The Santa Fe put on a big snow
plow Monday and started in clearing
up snow off Loth tracks east and west.
For a day or so the west bound track
has been blocked and the big snow
plow from Glorieta was sent over to
assist in clearing the right of way.
Many delays have been caused by the
unprecendentcd snow, but by a su
preme effort the Santa Fe men have
managed to get trains through some
how and are entitled to much credit.
Washouts were patched up by night
and day work and these were hardly
cured before along comes snows
heavier than known for fifty years,
but still the trains go through. The
one thing that assisted materially in
preventing a stubborn snow blockade,
was the fact that there was not much
wind with the snow to drift and fill
up the cuts. The snow shovelers and
all hands are hoping for a few weeks
clear weather in order to complete the
work of straightening things out. The
cold snap Monday morning when the
thermometer hit the 25 below zero
mark early in the morning is an in
dication that at least one grand in
stallment of the storm of the season,
has passed over.
Great Weather Variations
The mercury indicated 25 degrees
below zero early Monday morning.
Weather conditions as observed by
the average individual Monday morn
ing seemed to prove the mercury's
contention. The one good thing about
it is that our mercury does not stick
and hang, around 25 degrees, but
starts going up the line again a few
minutes after it hits the lowest point.
At the Lowell observatory up on the
hill it was over, twenty degrees warm
er than down in the city.
Al Doyle Done in Oil
Artist James Swinnerton has com
pleted a splendid picture of Al Doyle,
the old guide, friend and philosopher,
in oil. The picture shows Al with hat
in hand, gazing off onto the great
Painted Desert from the vantage
point of a bluff and it is so natural that
you can almost hear him telling of the
big storm of over thirty years ago.
It is a remarkable picture of a re
markable old pioneer and "was
drawed just like he was."
Artist Swinnerton has a large col
lection of fine paintings of the south
west and especially of the Indian
country and they rank with the best
artists in the country, notwithstand
ing the fact that he first attained
fame by his "Little Jimmy" funny
pictures.
A Test of Advertising Value
In talking recently with a man who
has made a large success as an ad
vertising salesmanin another place,
this question was asked him: "When
a merchant says it does not pay to
advertise, what do you tell him?"
"I just ask him this," was the re
ply: "What proportion of the popula
tion of this town has been inside your
store during he past two months?"
Very few merchants ever claim
they have had 10 per cent of the pop
ulation. Most of the non-advertisers
would be glad to get one per cent. A
lot of them probably' get only a small
percent"
SUPERIOR COURT DOINGS
Miss Mary Irene Bart was admitted
to citizenship by the Superior Court
Wednesday morning.
Letters of administration were
granted to M. C. Smith in the Patrick
McCoy estate and bond fixed at $10,
000, Wednesday.
RANGERS POT OUT 417
FIRES OUBWGUST SEASON
The District Forester at Albuquer
que announced today that first honors
for efficiency in fighting forest fires
during 1915 had been awarded to the
Sitgreaves National Forest, in charge
of Supervisor C. H. Jennings of Snow
flake, Arizona. Out of a total of 42
fires, 34 were detected and txtingu
ished before they had burned over 1
acre.
The Crook National Forest with
headquarters at Safford, Arizona, re
ceived honorable mention for an ex
cccdigly good fire record, attained
hove er under conditions which did
not test the real effectiveness of the
fire-fighting plan.
Generally speaking, the fire season
of 1915 was abnormally dry and ac
cordingly dangerous. Rainfall was
especially light in southern Arizona
and southeastern New Mexico. A to
tal of 417 fires occurred, burning over
a total of G000 acres and doing dam
age estimated at $4700. The average
area burned over was 2l acres, but
899 of the fires were extinguished
before they had covered 10 acres.
A special time-keeping system, de
signated to analyze the various fact
ors bearing-on efficiency in the work
of fire suppression, yielded some in-
teresting figures. It took an averacc
of 48 minutes for fire-lookouts to
reach a telephone to get reports of
smoke to the Supervisor. 1 hour and
37 minutes later the Ranger had, on
the average, arrived at the fire with
tools and provisions, traveling an
average of 517 miles. The" average
time elapsing between the first sight
ing of smoke and the final extinguish
ment of the fire was 27 hours. In the
old days before the Forest Service
telephone systems were constructed,
the time consumed by these same
operations was often measured in
days instead of hours.
On the whole, Forest officers ex
press themselves as gratified that the
dangers of a very dry season should
have been averted with only nominal
losses, and express the hope that the
steady extension of roads, trails, and
telephone lines and further improve
ments in methods, will gradually re
duce the fire menace to National For
est timber.
Is Your Enlarged Picture Here?
Chas. Prochnow has a large collec
tion of enlarged pictures at the Com
mercial hotel that he would be pleased
to return to owners if they will call
for them. A solicitor collected them
during 1914 around town to be en
larged. The originals and the en
larged pictures were sent here and
left as baggage at the hotel and in
cleaning up old baggage and such
stuff left by transients, these pictures
were found He will be pleased to
turn them over to the proper owners
if they will call for them.
OWNERS SHARE PROFITS
WITH MINERS ON COPPER
Jerome's two leading mining com
panies, the United Verde and United
Verde Extension, have granted their
employes a wago increase of 25 cents
a shift This is the third time that
they' have advanced wages since the
upward trend in the copper market
began, the total increase being 75
scnts a shift.
Both the United Verde and United
Verde Extension operate under the
Butte sliding wage scale. It is based
on 15 cent copper, and increases are
granted when the price of the red
metal goes above that figure. There
are no reductions, however, when cop
per is selling below 15 cents.
Two bodies of native copper and
oxidized copper ore, running from 35
to 52 per cent copper, have been
opened recently on the 1400-foot level
on the United Verde Extension. Never
was a more remarkable showing un
covered in the famous old United
Verde.
Lee AIlsup for City Marshal
Lee AIlsup announces this week that
he will be a candidate for the office of
City Marshal at the coming city elec
tion in May. Mr. AIlsup is a married
man with a family and is the owner
of residence property in the city. For
a number of years he has been con
nected with the city water service
where his work has been of the hon
est conscientious kind and he pro
mises a. fair and impartial enforce
ment of the laws governing the city
if elected to fill the position.
Mr. AIlsup has many warm friends
in the city who believe that he would
be the right man for the place and one
who would give prompt attention to
every detail of the duties imposed
upon him.
WILL DEVELOP BIG
WATER PROJECT
EARLY IN SPRING
Mr. J. J. Reynolds, of Chicago, chief
cjinecr for the Jolict & Eastern
Railway Co., was in consultation with
C. H. Spencer relative to the work to
be done on the big water development
scheme of the Coconino Water Devel
opment and Stock Co., recently organ
ized and incorporated by Mr. Spencer.
The water location and rights are
north and east of the San Francisco
mountains and the company proposes
to develop sufficient water to furnish
the Santa Fe, Grand Canyon and
other places with a plentiful supply
of' water, including water for stock
purposes and irrigation around north
and cast of the monutain.
Mr. Spencer is certain that the
greater portion of the snowfall and
drainage from the San Francisco
mountains can be tapped from the
north side of the mountain and that
but a small portion of it runs into the
springs in the basin owned by the
city.
If Mr. Spencer's contention is cor-
reci ami ne nas nad years of expe-
rience alonB this line, his plant will
' mean a Ereat advancement in the
development of this section of the
country. There is every indication
that his contention as to water drain
ago to the north is correct. Hardly
one tenth part of the precipitation on
the city springs watershed reaches
the city and it must find an outlet in
some directions other than south.
The company intends starting act
ive development work on the water
project early next spring.
On the Job Night and Day
Trainmaster Duffield and George K.
Anderson of the power service were
in Flagstaff Monday and Tuesday on
the job of moving trains and the big
snow plow. Trains have been de
layed a great deal because only one
track can be used betwen here and
Williams and there are no side tracks
available. The sidings are all block
aded by snow. With reasonable
weather, the blockade will be cleared
up this week.
Broken Weather Records
George Herrington, the local U. S.
weather man has compiled some in
teresting figures on the recent storms.
He reports that there was 54 inches
of snow fall during January, not in
cluding the December storm, 8.16
inches of water, which doubles all pre
vious records for the month. In 1911
there was 4.04 inches of water, the
average precipitation being 2.06 inch
es. A measure taken of snow now on
the ground shows 8.16 inches of water
just as it lays. There was probably
1 12 inches of water all told during the
snow and rain storms.
Monday night 25 below zero broke
all available records; 23 below being
the coldest previous record.
The high wind on the night of the
28th came from the southwest with a
velocity of 58 miles per hour, which
equaled the old record of 1905 or
1906.
The total amount of snow fall was
practically twelve feet
On January 31st the average depth
of snow in this vicinity was 34 inches,
at Fort .Valley, 42 inches.
