Not only is It possible for tho bel

PLAN TO STEAL
DURANT'S TRADE
Rciiortctl Conspiracy tst Dcnlsott Re
sults In Row and Making Public
of Schcmo and Probable IUlgrt
tlon Tho Story of tlio Ituso'.
Has Detlison conspired to como
?lght into tho city of Durant and pull
trade from Durant merchants into
Dehison? It is strongly believed
that such a conspiracy has existed,
although no positive proof orvfacts
aro available; but a reported row in
a Dcnlson commercial organization
meeting is responsible for tho leak
ing ou tof bucIi information as has
reached local' ears.
As the story goes, a DepiSon Jitney
driver had started out to run a lino
from Dcnlson to flnr.int mnlrlno- Dni.
rscttgh .J ; -.-.,., ...v...uo u,-
,orai trips aaily, and 'charging tho
samo faro as 'charged by the railroad
trains between tho two cities. Trlns
wore made back And forth JuBt as or
ten as thoy could be made with ono
car, and business was getting good
tor the J'tney man. It seems, accord
ing to report,, hat Denlson mer
chants, through the Dcnlson Com
mercial Club, had mado an agree
ment with the jitney man that all
persons from Durant who wished to1
go to Denlson to trade wore to bo
transported to Denlson and back free
of charge, with tho side agreement
that tho Denlson stores which were
tho recipients of tho trade of tho vis

itors wero to pay tho jitney owner
a commission on the business
The
scheme was on for somo time, ac
cording to information, but one par
ticular store In Denlson seemed to be
getting all the best of the deal, and
It looked like there had been still
another deal (undor cover, as It
were) because the jitney and this

was to unload-all prospective Durant
patrons at this particular tsore. At
least, other Denlson stores are said
to have put up a holler that this one
store was getting all the busineaw do-

will result In making the Jitney driv

No comment is necessary. The
deal is clear. It sneaks for itself.
EXPLAINS AGREEMENT
ON INDIAN PAYMENTS
Carter Speaks on Stipulations of the
Treaty. Points Out Principal
Points About Per Cnplta.
A complpte explanation of the
treaty stipulations, upo nwhlch the
Choctaw and Chickasaw per capita
payments in the Indian appropriation
bill are based Was made to the House
of Representatives by Representative
Carter during the general debate on
the measure In Congress the first of
the wee.k. There wero two salient
provisions In the Atoka agreement of
1398 and the supplemental agreement
of 1902, he said, which were adopted
by both the Government and tho In
dians. One of these agreements was
a pledge to close tho rolls, and that
no person should participate In. the
tribal estate unless he was enrolled
The other was that tho tribal mon
eys should be distributed by March,
1907i and a Bale mado of all tho prop
erty not allotted.
'Unless" the provision had been In
serted for a poymont of the tribal
moneys, neither tho Atoka agreement
nor the supplemental agreement ev
er would have been approved by tho
Indians," said Mr. Cartor. "Not one
vote would have peen cast by tho In
dians In favor of tho compacts. Tney
were solemn agreements on the part
of the Federal Government with
those Indian tribes."
Ho also showed that thoro wore
eleven benefits in the agreement, nine
of which were for the white settlors,
and two for tho Indians, they bolng
the ones mentioned. The Govern
ment hnd closed tho rolls, he said, but
Congress was being Importuned every
session to reopen them. The agree
ment to distribute the tribal moneys,
however, had been ruthleosly disre
garded.
Representative Hastings made a
speech In regard to the Mississippi
Choctaws, who are claimants for tri
bal participation, and, told how the
quostibn of their rights had been five
times adjudicated, ono tlmo, being by
tho Supreme Court ofd the Unite
States. In every Instance, ho said,
the decision had been against tho
Mississippi claimants.

ANOTHER KILLING
NEAR ACHILLE
S. E. RniiiH Receives Fatal Wounds
in Drunken Row with I). Turnbiill.
Cluirgo of Murder Has Been Filed
Against Turnbiill.
In a drunken row at the home of
S. E. Rains, near Achllle', Tuesday af
ternoon about 4 o'clock, S. E. Rains
received injuries that caused his
death shortly before G o'clock Wed
nesday morning, and D. Turnbull,
whllo not seriously hurt, is protty
bndly beaten up about the head and
has one broken bono In his right
hand. Turnbull, after he, sobered
up. said he did not know how Rains
could have been Injured bad enough
to cause death, and no one was pres
ent at tho tlmo tho men had their
difficulty.
County Attorney Turnbull and
Sheriff Phillips went to the scone
early Wednesday and made a thor
ough investigation. Turnbull faces
a murder charge, nnd will probnbly
waive an examining trial Thursday
or Friday and ask for bail.
Tht details of the affair, the re
lations of the two men, and Just what
occurred, aro set down here Just as
told a reporter by County Attorney
Turnbull, , who had the Information
from Mrs. Rains:
Turnbull and Rains lived within
three-quarters of a mile of each oth
er. Rains rented part of Turnbull's
land, and tho two men had gotten
along well always. Tuesday Turn
bull went oVer to Rains' house to
see him on Borne business, liisf. na
they were sitting down to dinner, At
the Rains home also were Mr. and
Mrs. Rnper, Mrs. Raper being Mrs:
Rains' sister. Rains brought1 out a
quart bottle of alcohol, nartlv full.
and suggested u drink, and he and
Turnbull drank along, finally finish
ing that. bottle, when another was
brought,, out,' After tho meal was
finished the men still sat at the ta
ble, drinking and getting: drunker
and drunk&r, and finally began' td
quarrel and fuss at each other, as
urunK men will do. Finally, about
4 o'clock, or a llttlo later, the two
men got up and commenced to strike
at each other, Rains charging that
Turnbull had called Mrs. Rains a
liar, to which Turnbull is said to
have replied: "No; you s - - ,
I didn't say she was a liar; but you
are a liar." Before this Mr. and Mrs.
Raper had left, and Mrs. Rains en
deavored to separate the men, but
failed, and they fell over on the bed,
still battering each other's faces. She
then hurried to Tumbril's hnn
three-quarters of a milo distant, and
told Mrs. Turnbull what was up, and
3he and her son returned with Mps.
Rains to the Rains house. When
they got to the house, both men lay
on the floor. Rains lay sort or on
his face in a pool of blood, bleeding
from the ear. Both were .badly
bruised about the face, and Turnbull
had a broken bone In hlsfrlght hand.
During the fight, before Mrs. Rains
had left the hpuse, Turnbull had tak
en his knife from his pocket, snap
ping thp blade, but It had not been
used, nor was it found anywhere In
the house afterward. A loaded shot
gun stood against the wall, and a
loaded pistol lay in a table drawer
near by, Turnbull was taken home
and sobered up, and Dr. O. E. String
er was summoned from Achllle to see
to Rains. The only wound of a ser
ious nature which he located, was a
slight laceration of the scalp on the
back of the head, but which did not
penetrate nor fracture the skull. TIir
doctor said that this blow, probably
maue oy somo small, bluut Instru
ment, and causod the bursting of a
blood vessel on the brain which caus
tho hemorrhage at the ear. No ar-
ucio or instrument which showed
any signs of having beon used as a
weapon could be found In the house.
Turnbull is a man of about forty-
nve years or age, and tho head of a
family. He is a man of good renute
and stands well In that community.
ne uoes not havo tho reputation of
beipg a habitual drinker, and Is not
known to hnve been in trouble be
fore Rains also stood well, and was
considered a law-abidihg citizen: but
was considerably addicted to tho use
or liquor.
