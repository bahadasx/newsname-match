Flames Sweep Through the
Magnificent Building—
Two Wings Damaged.
BOTH TOWERS ARE
COMPLETE RUINS
Conflagration Gained Tre
mendous Start and Fight
ers Were Impotent.
Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 4.—
The parliament building fire
was quenched this morning
after an all night fight. The
library building was saved
after a stubborn fight.
The morning revealed no
farther casualties other than
those reported last night.
Officials declared there is
absolutely no ground for the
reports that the fire was of
incendiary origin.
"The fire started in the
reading room of the house of
commons, right under the
nose of a policeman," one
official stated.
-The: central part of the
main building, including the
chambers of commons and
senate was destroyed. Both
the east and west ends of the
buildings are but little dam
aged. The towers. are com
pletely ruined.
Ottawa, Feb. 4.—The Canadian par*
liament buildings.are in ruins.
Fire which tf oke out at 9 o'clock
last night in the Commons reading
room swept with tremendous fury
down the corridors and leaped to the
galleries, and' in the space of three
minutes had filled the whole wing with
an impenetrable volume of smoke. It
was followed quickly by flames.
Two people are known to be dead.
They are Madame Bray, wife of Dr.
Bray of Quebec and Madame Morin,
wife of Dr. Louis Morin, Quebec. They
were guests of Madame Sevigny, the
wife of the speaker, and were cut off
in their apartments.
Madam? Sevigny escaped by leaping
Into a Are net,, while Hon. Martin
Burrell, minister of agriculture, was
severely burned about the face and
hands when escaping from his office,
which adjoins the Commons' reading
room.
The origin of the flre is a mystery.
It may never be known. There were
suspicions last night of incendiarism,
possibly by a German agent, but as.
policemen were on guard at both
doors of the room where the flre start,
ed and others in tne room itself, It
would have been difficult for anyone
to deliberately set the flre without be
ing detected. A smouldering cigar
butt might have done It, though
smoking in that quarter is supposed
to be prohibited.
Filled with thousands of loose pa
pers, the flames leaped from stand to
stand with an almost inconceivable
rapidity. At the same, time the smoke
rolled forth in dense clouds of suffo
cating volume. While an alarm was
Instantly raised, the escape of mem
bers, of people in the galleries and
the house staff with so small a list of
missing Is remarkable.
At 8 o'clock the house assembled
as usual, with thirty members in their
seats and a hundred visitors In the
galleries.
A. K. MacLe&n had finished speak
ing, and W. F. Loggle had just com
menced. A messenger put his head
through the chamber door behind the
sergeant at arms and shouted "flre!"
Two minutes later smoke rolled down
through the corridor from the read
ing room, and flames roared down be
hind it. Members rushed this way
and that.
E. N. Rhodes, -who was in the chair,
had presence of mind to formally ad
journ the house.
Those who endeavored to seek exit
by the back were met with- rolling
smoke and searing flames.
The first who got out from behind
the speaker's chair escaped down to
ward the main entrance without mis
hap.

Washington, Feh. 4.—In the course
of his testimony before the senate
committee on military affairs, Cpl. Ed
win F. Glenn, U. 8- A., chief of staff
on Governors Island, told of 116 un
protected landing places along' the
Atlantic coast betweep Portland. Me.,
and the Virginia Capes. He said that
at any one of these plaoes an enemy
would be able to land an invading
force, once that enemy |ot oontrot of

the 116 places he had. in mind, nor
was he asked to do so.
The location of each of these pos
sible landings, together with the depth
of' water at all tides, the' 'nature of
the country behind them, the rail
roads that supply them, and other ma
terial facts are today known to every
general staff in Europe, while the Q«r»

Berlin, Feb. 4.—Information reaching the Associated

New instructions forwarded to Ambassador von

regret for the sinking of the Lusitania. The suggested
