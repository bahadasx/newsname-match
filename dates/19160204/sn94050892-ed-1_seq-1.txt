With the exception of a few minor
incidents the large body of former
employees have resumed their occu
pations without any friction. There
was a misunderstanding at Met-
calf one day last week when the 1
miners quit: work for a few hours
but the, matter was quickly adjusted
1 to the satisfaction t)f all concerned.
Again at Morenci on- Wednesday
there was a note of discontent over
the manner of in which the Duncan
refugees were brought into the camp.
A committee of miners met the man
agers interested and the committee
returned .to work fully satisfied. Fed
eral Investigators Davies and Myers
were called back to the district and
have been using their good offices in

It may be said at the. end of the
week gcod will and a kindly . feeling
prevails on all sides.
A conference among the, managers
of the district was held oh Wednes
day and Thursday. In. addition to
Mine Managers Bennie, Carmichael
and McLean, representing the three
large producing companies of the
district, the conference was attended
' by, Walter Douglas, General Manager
of Phelps, Dodge Company; A. T.

and Federal Investigators Davies and
Myers .
Mr. Walter Douglas and Mr. A.
T. Thomson departed on a special

meeting of the officers and managers
on Thursday questions, which will
likely come up at the . approaching
conferences, between the committees
representing employees and the mine
-managers, were gone over.
John L. Donelly, Vice-President of
the State Federation of Labor who
directed strike matters in the district
just prior to the decision of the men
to return to work, remains in the dis
trict. On Thursday he stated that
lie would probably make Clifton his
home.
"Things are going on well here,"
said Mr. Donnelly. "The men are
being put to work as fast as the
mines can provide places for them.
Almost all of the men are now at
work, and it is expected that the re

days.

"There are few among the younger

Assailant Arrested in Lordsburg
Awaiting Preliminary Hearing Dis
pute Over Possession of Land Was
- Cause.
Sunday afternoon about 2:30
o'clock George Haydon and Robert
M. Reynolds were putting up the
frame work of a goat herder's shack
a mile south of Pyramid Peak near
Lordsburg, when Eugene "Curley"
Rolland of a neighboring cow camp
came up to them, inquiring as to their
mission on the ground.
Mr. Hayden informed him that
they were putting up a shack to
protect their herder during the severe
weather. Mr. Rolland is said to
have thereupon laid his claim to the
ground stating that he was holding
the proper.y with his squatter s right.
It was alleged that hot words ensued
between the two men over the right
of possession of the ground and it is
alleged, as Mr. Haydon turned to
walk away Rolland pulled a six shoot
er, . pointed it at Haydon and snap
ped the trigger. The gun failed to'
diL'( haw As Mr. ITayd-3.i tur:.-' 'a
face Rolland the latter again pulled
the trigger. This time the gun dis
charged, the bullet entering Mr.
Haydon's left arm above the elbow
shattering the bones.
According to an eye witness Mr.
Rolland stayed at the scene of the
shooting until Mr. Reynolds had
hitched the horses to the wagon and
helping Mr. Haydon onto the seat,
drove to Lordsburg. Dr. M. M.
Crocker attended the injured man and
obtained passage for him on an east-
bound freight train to Deming, all
passenger trains being annulled.
At Deming an operation was perform
ed by Dr. Swope at the hospital and
it Is possible that the arm will be
saved. Mrs. Haydon followed her
husband to Deming by automobile.
"Curley" Rolland came in to Lords
burg Sunday night and on Monday
morning about 9 o'clock was placed
under arrest. His bond was fixed
at $1,000 by Justice of the Peace C.
W. Marasalis. Bond was furnished
and February 3 set for the date of pre
liminary hearing. A wide-spread in

BILL GURRIES $25,000.00
. . i i ' '
This Amount Apportioned Among
Several States. Arizona's Pro ;
Rata Will Amount To $117,000 As
Provided in Shackelford Bill.
In the House of Representatives on
the 24th ult., the Rural Post Roads
Bill was .under consideration in the
, lw
I . . conclusion of the remarks
, A lDe c onc " slon or . f e I?ma3
I by .Mr. Shackelford, he yielded the
j floor to Representative Hayden of
Arizona, who addressed the House
oh this important subject as follows:
Mr. Hayden. Mr. Chairman, what
policy shall be adopted by Congress
respecting national-road ' ' legislation?
The opinion is almost unanimous
among the Members of both Houses'
that good roads are a necessity; that
it is desirable that the Federal Gov
ernment contribute in some measure'
to their construction and ' mainten
ance, and 'that ample authority is
found in .the Constitution to permit
appropriations by Congress-for'- this
purpose. The only question is as to
the method' of procedure.
; In common with a number of .other
Congressmen, I have introduced a bill
to provide for national aid to ' the
several States ia the - construction
I m , I , ... J
ul ""
and while' the pending measure' does
not entirely conform to my idea of
i . . ,
wh&t a sood roads bill ought to be,
i yet I intend to give it my heartiest
, support -because I-Vtnow . 'that .
the
i Committee on Roads has given most
Committee on Roads has given
eyeful consideration to this legisla-
jtion. Like most all of the other bills
jthe Shackleford bill contemplates an
i annual expenditure of $25,000,000 for
road construction and maintenance
by tne Federal Government, to-
be
apportioned among tne states and to
.be expended under the supervision of
Secretary of Agriculture,
. , t.
lue ""suu-y wm apportion B9
money appropriated among: the
States, after deducting a -sum neces
sary for administrative, purposes and
a f urhter sum sufficient to .' provide
for an allotment of $65,000 to each
State, on the basis of population' and
the mileage of rural post roads, and
star routes. . In this respect the
pending measure differs from the
bill which I introduced..1 It appears
to me that it would be more equitable
to the Western States to apportion
the money one-third according to
the number of Senators and Repre
sentatives to which each State re
spectively is entitled in Congress,
one-third in accordance -with the
ratio which the area of each State
bears to the area of the United States,
and the remaining onethird according
to the mileage of rural delivery and
star routes. I have no doubt, how
ever, but that the committee had
good reasons for adopting the method
of dividing the appropriation as pro
vided in this bill.
. The bill before us very properly
provdes that in allotting Federal aid
the Secretary of Agriculture shall
deal with the States as units and not
with the counties or other subdivis
ions, as has been proposed in the
bills which passed this House on
former occasions. After groping
around learning' costly lessons by ex
perience, we have finally reached the
conclusion that there is too much lo
cal control in the business of build
ing roads. The most efficient plan
that has as yet been advised in the
United States for the construction
and maintenance of public roads is
to create a State highway deaprt
ment. Over one-half the States have -
already adopted this method of super
vising their road work, and the pass
age of this bill means that before
very long every State in the Union
will provide by law for a State high
way department or a State . highway1
engineer having authority to super
vise and direct the construction and
maintenance of the public roads and
highways of the state.
By recognizing and encouraging the
establishment of State highway de
partments we permit each State to
solve its own road problems. The
State of Maine is one of the summer
