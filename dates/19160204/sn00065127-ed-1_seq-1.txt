BARACAS REAL MEAN.
Bury the Hudson High School Team
Under an Avalanche of Baskets.
Last Saturday evening the Hudson
high school quintet came to our city
to play a game of basket ball with the
fast Baraca team. At the very start
it could be seen that the Hudson boys
had no show at all and as three of
their numbers were short they could
not do much in blocking the passes of
their taller opponents. The tirst half
closed with the score 34 to 0 in the
Baracas favor.
After seeing the members of the
visiting team indulging in "colflo
nails" while practicing shooting bask
ets there did not seem to be much
sympathy for them in the audience.
When the whistle blew for the second
half the Baracas started out with 100
as the score they were after and they
played rings all around the Hudson
buys who when they did get their
hands on the ball scarcely ever got it
near their own goal. T'.ie farce ended
LOO to 2 in favor of the local players.
The Canton players were Eugen,
Howe, Brenner, Alnsworth, Stanley
and Rasmusseu as his substitute in
the second half. Hudson it es were:
Roberts, Parkenson, Jackson, Trickle,
Trickle and one sub. Homer Bain
bridge, timer K. E. Jacobson, scorer
and Albert Cleveland referee. The
game was very free of fouls only three
or four free throws were had and
those all missed the baskets.
Augustana Five Defeated.
The Augustana college basket ball
live accompanied by a few rooters
went to Sioux Falls Monday afternoon
and played a return game with the
Lutheran Normal five tu their gym
nasium which resulted in a score of
28 to 18 In favor of the Normals. The
game was a hard fought one and full
of fouls on both sides. The Canton
team was a little slow with their team
work but made their opponents work
for all their scores.
Band or No Band?
That is the question that is being
discussed a great deal In the surround
ing towns and in most cases the
answer if "AND
Sunday a young man pointed at a
horn and case and said "That cost me
8100" and at present It Isn't worth
100 cents to him as he has no use for
it and that is no doubt the case of ten
or lifteeu other young Canton men.
We have plenty of material for a good
band here in Canton and we know of
a baud leader who has a good reputa
tion who we have been told would
move to our city if a baud was organ
ized. If we are not mistaken there is
a law which says that a city may levy
a tax of one mill for the maintance of
a band. Lets put It up to the pec pie
at the next election and have them
uecide. The merchants have kept the
baud up in the past while the people
have enjoyed the concerts, now let
the people try it a year.
It is not necessary to have a big
baud. Mitchell, three times as large
as Canton, is planning on a band of
only 12 pieces and smaller towns than
ours are organizing for the coming
season. Nothing that can be done
will draw more farmers and people
from neighboring towns in the sum
mer time than a good band concert.
Now is the time bo talk this matter
over and get it started. Let the Can
ton Commercial Club wake up long
enough for a meeting and see what
they think about it.

Gillman-Phillips.
On the 29th of January, 1910, Mr.
Frederick Edward Gillman of Web
ster City, Iowa, and Miss Sadie Phil
lips of Belolt, Iowa, were married at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Boyce
In Canton, S. D.
Precisely at 11 o'clock a. m., Miss
Genevlve Oliver played the march
and as the sweet strains rose and fell
through the home. Rev. Zellhoefer,
followed by the bride and groom slow
ly marched into the parlor to the
cozy place reserved for them amid a
profusion of flowers. Soon the strains
of the celebrated Lohengrin march
ceased Its sweet refrain and Rev. Zell
hoefer performed the beautiful ring
ceremony which united these .voung
people for life. The groom was attired
in the conventional black while the
bride was tastefully dressed in cream
chiffon, trimmed in pearls and car
ried a bouquet of bride's roses and
carnations.
After the ceremony was over the
young husband and bride were ready
for the congratulations of their ^rela
tives and friends which was given
them with much pleasure. The bride
and groom followed by the guests
went to the dining room where a
sumptuous two course wedding break
fast was served. The table was ar
tistically decorated with pink and
white carnations. The guests enjoy
ed watchlng.the bride as it was her
duty to cut her own wedding cake.
After enjoying the repast they re
turned to the parlor where the bride
sang solos accompained by Miss Gene
vlve Oliver on.the piano and the af
ternoon soon passed away. Then the
bride and groom went down to Belolt
to pass the next few days with her
parents at her old ancestrlal home.
She Is the eldest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Wm. H. Phillips and was born
In her grandfather's house, who was
James A. Carpenter as all old pioneers
well remember back amid the
vears of 1870 and later on through
the hard times of 1875 to '79 when the
grasshopper scourge was destroying
the crops of the early settlers.
The Carpenters were old friends of
Mr. and Mrs. E M. Boyce back in
Belolt, Wis before they came west
to the beautiful Big Sioux Valley,
therefore being a personal friend of
the Carpenters for many years Mrs.
Boyce had promised Sadie that when
she was married she would make the
wedding for her. Although both Mr.
and Mrs..Boyce were nearly sick they
braced up and with the help of some
kind neighbors, Mesdames Rood and
Loveless and Miss Genevlve Oliver
and her friend they managed to ac
complish It.
The invited guests at this quiet
home wedding were: Mrs. Zellhoefer,
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Phillips, Mrs.
Tom Rood, Mrs Loveless, Earl E.
Boyce, Mr. and Mrs W. W. Teach
and baby, Misses Genevlve Oliver and
Opal Kundert. The groom presented
the bride with a beautiful gold neck
lace and the other presents were both
beautiful and useful.

A Bob Ride.
Last Sunday afternoon Dewey!
Evanson invited a party of eighteen
people,consisting of Olga Skartvedt,
Esther Murner, Francis Lantaff, Iva
Anderson, Hattie and Kalma Grann
eng, Genevlve Oliver, Palma Juel,
Marlon Balnbrldge. Arthur Ilelgerson
Arthur Belknap, Ernest Howe, Neal
Gerber, Oliver Overseth, Harold Moe
and Albert Jennings, to his home 17
miles southwest of Canton.
They hired the big double bob, a
driver, and four horses leaving Can
ton about 3 p. m. When about half
way the driver suggested, pleaded
and entreated to turn home but with
no avail. Everyone staunchly stuck
by the "ship" and finally went on.
And so the afternoon wore on through
snow drifts and hills. We got to Moe
In time for the second show but we
decided we had better continue. The
last two miles were so long we really
suspected Dewey of fibbing.
When we got outside of Evanson's
gate going down a hill the hind run
ner broke and we naturally walked,
well not exactly a walk, we ran and
it certainly was a night attack on the
house it being about (i:30 Mrs.
Evanson knew how to prepare eatables
that tempt the appetites and as soon
as we had divested ourselves of our
numerous wraps we fairly devoured a
three course dinner. After dinner
we played games until 9 p. m. and
the driver attempted to round up the
crowd for the return trip But on
account of a high wind and Intense
cold It was decided we should stay all
night. So one of the girls 'phoned to
our parents and told them the unsur
prising news. The most tired ones
went to bed while the others sat up,
and the night wore on. Such a slum
ber party never was and it will not
be forgotten soon. One of the boys
had such an uncontrolable giggle that
he kept every one awake that tried to
sleep and thus entertained the crowd.
Numerous tricks were played one of
which was blacking the sleepers' faces
with burnt cork. At about 6:00 a. m.
the driver gravely informed us that
he was going to hitch the horses and
we should all be ready In 15 minutes.
The hoys were finally awakened by 7.
After eating a hearty breakfast we
took our departure declaring Evan
sons' royal entertainers.
At Moe a halt was called for about
3i minutes and the frozen ones were
allowed to get warmed. After getting
nicely tucked in we started once more
and everyone was just enjoying the
ride when without any warning what
ever we were sprawling In a big snow
drift. Harold Moe could not resist
brown poplin and her husband left
Tuesday for their future home which
he has prepared for her In Webster
City, Iowa, where he is engaged in an
extensive automobile business which
he has built up since coming from
England a few years ago. He belongs

men. The friends unite In wishing
them a long and prosperous life and

The Athletic Association of Au

many expert skiers from this and ad
joining states will compete (or the

want to see something that will make
your heart jump just go and witness
men making big jumps at lighting

that all who have sleds will be will

hill if the snow is still deep Only
25c admission will be charged for an
afternoon of thrilling events.
the temptation to take a snap-shot of
the bunch tho' it was unfair to take
advantage when we were down.
The journey was resumed. We
went ou and on, each hill and drift
being announced by a series of squells
from the girls and groans from the
boys. Within 5 miles Of town we
stopped to warm at a farm house
About 12:30 we landed in Canton and
it never looked better. With the ex
ception of one or two the crowd ap
peared in school and we all felt that
the teachers should appreciate our
presence. We enjoyed the bob-ride

it again but the weather could be
warmer.

Advice For Girls With Leap
Intentions.
Year
To all daughters of Eve who have
leap year intentions, the vocational
guide and well know bachelor William
J. Klbby, today offers advice concern
ing the habits, characteristics and
dispositions of various sorts of men,
which Is intended to help the girls
win their hearts' desires without suf
fering rebuff In the process. A good
deal of what Kibby says Is based up
on phrenology. A man who has thin,
straight llpt- Is branded a cold blood
ed, stony hearted creature upon whom
the dearest girl's appeal would have
no effect. This sort of man will do
his own proposing, run his own wedd
ing and rule his household and he'll
do It more with his head than his
heart. But if the man of your choice
has full, well-formed lips, Kibby says
you may depend upon his capacity for
and inclination to, love. He also Is
susceptible to the right sort of femin
ine approach. The way to tell wheth
er the one you love, loves you, is by
the coloring of the under lip when he
Is with you. Every human emotion
gives some physical demonstration
when it is aroused. The evidence
that love has been aroused is given by
the deep crimsoning of the under lip.
If his under lip is pertpetually pale
when he Is with you. be doesn't love
you. If it is crimson and you want
