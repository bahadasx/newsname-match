CITY'S BATTLE
AGAINST O-W
ON IN EARNEST
F\l I in, Mr. Business Mnn, the fight is on!
I he Harriman railroads' interests have de
clared a blockade.
Fall in and man the guns!
It has come to a showdown between the
Harriman railroads (the Southern Pacific, Union
Pacific and 0.-W. R. & \.) and the Northwest.
Equal, indiscriminatory tourist rates from
Chicago to San Francisco have been demanded
by the Northwest and refused. Arbitration has
failed. Diplomacy has been sneered at.
From now on it is a fight to i finish—a
tooth for • tooth, an eye for an eye, a life for
a life!
The railroads are hauling, and declare thev
will continue to haul, tourists from the East to
California and return via Southern lines for
S! 7.50 less than they will allow them to be
hauled via Northern lines.
The Harriman interests control the situation.
The result is a blockade against tourists entering
the Northwest.
IT MEANS THE LOSS OF MILLIONS OF
YOU. MR. BUSINESS MAN!
Your captains in the fight for equality with
California business men have been named.
Thev are Joshua Green. Perry Poison and
A. C. Mitchell.
YOU ASKIiD FOR THEM. THERE
THEY ARE.
Fall in, and stand behind them till the fight
is won!
The 0.-W. R. & N. is discriminating against
you and your business, and at the same time
asking your patronage.
WHEN A IX)(i BITES YOU, WHAT DO
YOU DO?

If Seattle hu«lne»* men win
their fight against the llarrltnan
railroad*, and the Interstate com

tourist blockade In the Northwest,
there ts nothing. It was learned
Friday, to prevent the llarrltnan
roads frotn dropping their rates

situation exactly similar.
"But with the united support of
every business man." declared

He pointed out that the Hurrl

lines, $ 17.50 cheaper than the tour
Ist rate between the same terinl

distance this way Is 25.1 miles
shorter.
"We sre trying to equalize those
rates," he nald. "Hut If wo suc
