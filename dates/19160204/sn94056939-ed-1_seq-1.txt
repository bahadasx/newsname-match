QUESTION OF LIGHTS
IMPORTANT ONE
Should IIiivo tlio Attention
of Evory Citizen and Busi
ness Man in Carrizozo Who
Want Town Improvements
TOWN AND COMMUNITY WILL
PROFIT FROM STREET LIGHTS
Wn ilu nut mean to docloru that
Carrizozo h n (load town just bo
enme things liavo worked together
to make it at present a dark town
Those wlio liko the town oí Carrizo
zo best uro thoso who are best
acquainted witli It, and no ono en
itorpriso of Carrizozo is stronger for
ltd linme town than the Outlook,
Wo are well aware that private
parties have subscribed generously
for ntreot lights for Carrizozo Tlio
bcstobtainblo gas light on eubstnn
tia' iron posts havo been provided
for the principal corners, and for
a considerable timo theso lights
wero kept up by tlicss samo public
cpiritcd men, purchased gasoline
for these lights to consumo whon the
moon was not on job, and paid
man to look after thorn, to see that
they were kopt in good working
order and to gonerato and light tlio
lamps before night took full charge
of our hustling little commonwealth
k Who got tlio benefit of these
light? Tilt whole iuwii uml eom
munity nllko reaped tlio good re
(suits of the system, Rut who paid
for them? A very few enterprising
spirits who wnntod to seo the town
move forward and wero willing to
dig deop to keep things moving in
tlio right direction But naturally
tho "regular call for caoh to keep
the lights on duty for all made
rather discouraging prospect whon
tlio burden was borne by tlio few
So the "favored few" began to
loose from its ranks thoso who re
fuso to be ridden to market and
then sold. In other words publi
ingratitude dumpened ovon (heard
or of Carrlzozo'e llvo ones, beoaus
there is nothing like appreciation
in keeping onthuslustio boosters con
utanlly doing tiieir lavoritu stunt
And so the lights, tlio best ob
tainablc, when they wero Installed
have been neglected because pro
vision for their maintcnunca ceased
to lio made. Can you Llamo tlio
burden boarcrs for ceasing to longer
be tlio goat?
What is the solution? Incnrpor
ntlon, no more, no less. Let
roii8oiiublo property tax bo levied
to support tho town's Improvement
and all will snare tno minien uro
partlonaleljj Of course the business
men and larger property holders
will shoulder most of the levy, but
thoy arc tho ones whj huve been
footing tho bills any wav audit will
bring a system luto play to make
the burden fall where it should
Nnr should the required levy bo
excessive as nomitial tax will put
tlio city treasury to tlio good am!
the muoh needed lights be easily
roallzod,
The Alto Light &: Power Co
liavo extended their eteotrlo linca to
Carrizozo and alroady practically
every citizen lias modern lights In
stalled both in his home and place
of business. Lot us pull together
and do tho same for tho streots of
tlio town, Talk Incorporation for
that's the only practical way to
talk street lights for Carrizozo
And to talk street lights Is the only
iWay to talk peogress Into the town.

CLAYTON ANTI-TRUST
t hit a nnrrnr pinar
Another Democratic Measure
Passed for tho Good of the
Common People is of Grónt
Advantage to Trusts
DEPT. OF JUSTICE CANNOT
REACH THE SITUATION
Washington, D.C. Jon. 31, (3 peo
i al Correspondence.) "Tho Cloy
ton anti-trust law, heralded by the
Democrats as a weapon against
unlawful combination In restraint
of trade, has proven to bo a fraud."
This bitter criticism of tho null
trust law, passed by tho last Demo
cralio Congress, was uttered today
by Representative Halvor Steenor
son of Minnesota,
"For weeks I hove been endoav
nrlng to liavo the Department of
Justice nnd tho Federal Trade Com
mission fix tho responsibility for
Increased prioa of gasnlino, which I
bellovo is due to nu unlawful com
blnatlon In restraint of trade," said
Mr- Steenerscn.
"Tlio fact is that tlio provisions
of the Clayton anti-trust act have
made It practically impossible fn
either the Dopartmont of Justico or
the FedorBl Trade Commission to
reach tho situation. Formerly the
government was able to prosecute
.W.Y vitiln iu. of '.lie ituii 'ills.
laws in restraint of trade, irres
pectlvo of the ellcct on prices, so
long ui thoro appeared to bo
combination which controlled pries
It was the POWER to fix prices
I lis t was condemned.
"Tho Clayton act provides fo
prosocution of iubstnnllal' lesser.
ing of competition. The insertion
of tho word Substantial in the
Clayton law hns practically taken
all tho teeth out of it While com
paratively easy to prove the exist
nuco of a combination, the Clayton
law hurl enormously increased tho
difiiculty of u conviction, owing to
the absolutely indefinite moaning of
the word 'Substantial '
' Furthermore Iho Trndo Com
mtstlnn law limits tho Investigation
of that Commission to whether
not there has been an unlawful
combination between inanufaotur
cis and dealers. In other words
this law protects tho big jobbers
and not the consumer.
"The Democrats by the Insertion
of Ibis troublesome word 'subslan
tint' iu the Clayton aot havo cm
aseulatcd the wholo scheme of trust
prosecution for violation of law
atiu nave virtually committed n
fraud upon those whom It wus sup.
posed to protect.
