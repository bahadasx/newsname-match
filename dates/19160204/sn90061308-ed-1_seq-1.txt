Seventy-Five Years in Barry
County
of
LJVjJwere very much pleased this
week to receive a letter from Wm. A.
Fly, of Purdy to be published in The
Times. Mr. Fly has lived in Barry
county many years and is one of the
best known and highly respected of
our citizens. The letter follows:
Purdy, Mo., Jan. 31, 1916.
D. A .Peters. Monett. Mo.
My Dear Sir: I amwritirig you
this letter for a better acquaintance.
I get the Monett Times every week
and I like it very much . It gives me
more general news than any paper I
read, home, local, state and foreign,
how and when you received it. 'I
like to read . I have quite a library
of bopks.
I followed farming until the last
few years. My age and health com
pelled me to quit.
I am now nearly ninety years old,
have lived in Barry county over seventy-five
years. My parents came to
what is now Barry county in the
spring of 1839. Lawrence, Newton
and McDonald counties were organ
ized from territory from Barry. Cir

cuit court was held at Clear Creek
about two miles west of where Peirce
City is now. I have. Jived in the coun
ty all thej time.
When the . railroad from Rolla to 'j
Grand River was completed I went on-
I an' excursion from Peirce City to .the
bridge over Grand River and back to
Peirce City. That was the first rail
road train I ever rode on.
I lived on Joys creek about two
miles east of Corsicana. I moved to
Purdy in 1886.
I was one of the judges of the coun
ty court four years. I then served in
the thirty-third and thirty-fourth gen
eral assemblies of Missouri as repre-j
sentative of Barry county.
We are now living in a progressive
age. Education is one of the leading
progressive things and I think
a good one. When. I went to
school the house was a log house. The
window was a log cut out one side or
end. The writing desk was a slab of
l'wood and our seats were split logs.

The teacher wrote copy on our paper spent in this world that I will be bet
for us to learn to write. We used the ter off by the aid of the strong grip of
old blue back Webster spelling book, the lion's paw of the tribe of Judah.
We used Pike's arithmetic that gave
us pounds, shillings and pence to study
instead of dollars, cents and mills.
The good roads provision in our
country is good for as near everybody
as any other improvement we could
make. I feel very favorable to this
progressive movement.
I have always voted the Democratic
ticket for national and state officers
since our war. I am known as a Un
ion Democrat, I voted against Mis
souri seceding . I -did not think it best
to make two general governments. I
never did think it was right to make
human, beings chattel slaves to sell
and buy like other property.
I think we are now living in an age
of the most . serious confusion the
world over, we ever did. The govern
ments that are not killing, starving
and destroying everything are being
seriously troubled and confused con
cerningVhat is going on and how to
keep out of their troubles. I
think ;
the European war and our Mexican
troubles have so confused and divided
the people in what they should do in
the way of legislation and how all
these troubles w?ll be settled that we,
the people of the United States, will
not have the quiet and peace that we
havehad in the past. Our people are
wonderfully -divided in what is best to
do. I think our representatives in
congress and state should lay aside

welfare of the great masses of the
people. Officers under the law are
public servants and guardians of the
great masses of the people. Time only
wil reveal what the end of our present
civil and military confusion and wars
will bring forth.
I feel very thankful that I have been
spared to live to see Barry county's
progress from 18J9 to the present, l
also feel very thankful to the people
of the county for their friendship and
the confidence they had in me by elect
ing me four times to office in the coun
ty and many other favors.
' I am now very feeble in health but
not confined to the bed all the time
and can be on my feet but little . My
seeing and hearing are very dim.
This will be my last letter, I think,
for publication. I am confined to the
house and yard . It will not be very
long at best until I will be done my
work and sufferings in this world, and
I have hopes that my life has been so
Yours very respectfully,

FLOODS THREATEN
LIVES OF 200 IN
ARKENSAS VALLEY
Special Train Bearing a Gasoline
Launch is Sent to Gould to Aid
Rescuers -
Little Rode, Ark., Feb. 2. Two
hundred persons are in peril at the
town of Gould in Desha county, twen
ty miles below Pine Bluff, according
to a report received at Pine Bluff to
night. The message said that the
Arkansas river flood, pouring through
the breaks in the levees, had engulfed
the little town, which is several miles
from the river, and that the residents
had been driven to the roofs of their
homes. . .
The message .said that if help did
'not arrive -within three hours it
would be too late. The water was
said to be sweeping through the town
so fiercely that no small boat could sur
vive in it. A special train carrying
a big gasoline- launch was sent out
from Pine Bluff. The train will go as
far as possible and then the rescuers
will set out in the launch.
The steamer Bay Queen, which was
chartered to rescue negro convicts
from the state farm at Cummins, was
ordered to Douglas this morning, as
the situation there was reported acute.
However, it was found that the water
was receding at Douglas and that the
people were not in grave danger. The
steamer returned to Cummins to make
a second effort to rescue 300 negroes
who have been huddled for two days
and nights on- what remains of the le
vee. It had not reported early to
night. '" " ,
The crest of the flood had passed
Pine Bluff tonight and is beginning to
raise havoc in the lower course of the
river. Five hundred refugees have
flocked into the little. town of Dumas.
It is expected the town will be under
