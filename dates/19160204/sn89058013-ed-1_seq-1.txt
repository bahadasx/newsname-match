Mr. and Mrs. Walker White

tives at Hollflday.

The Woodmen Circle met last
Saturday and instructed two ladies
in the mysteries of woodcraft and
voted on two new- applications for
membership. The ladies of the
. Circle are getting busy nd appli
cations are coming in fast.
Some correspondent said if we
were not iu favor 'of a $250,000
' road bond . issue to keep "mum."
Well, the writer is not in favor of
such an issue. We need good
roads bo one will deny it but
now to get them is the question
the people ef Benton County have
been trying to solve for years.
Bonds is something we get, and
then -there is no chance to turn
loose until the other man says so.
Then how can we pay them? You
ay with an extra assessment of
taxes. Poor old taxi He is badly
Abused. We are paying $1.55 on
the $100 worth of property, but
now are the lands assessed?. We
. know of lands in this locality that
are not assessed at one-third the
value. Now if we pay $1.55 on the
$100, suppose the, bonds are voted
on the county, what will we pay?
If the above mentioned tax does
not provide a sufficient fund even
to . keep up the bridges as they
, should be, what will you do when
we have to raise the money to pay
the bonds and interest? - interest
is the pet of eome people because
- "they are getting it.; others abuse it
because they have to pay interest.
Those in favor of bonds say they
can be sold at per cent, possibly
" lesa. Well, say 6 per cent. We
believe that is as good as we could
do, and in 16 years and 8 months
your $250,000 bonds wave drawn
$250,000 interest and like 3 years
and i months of maturing. Thus,
to illustrate, $250,000 draws inter
est at the rate of $15,000 annually.
v When the interest has amounted
to as much as the principal, then
we will lack 3 years and 4 month
of being ready to pay the principal.
The interest accruing iu these 3J
years is $50,000. Now complete
these amounts. Bouda, $25000;
interest, $300,000; total, $5550,000.
This'does not look good to thejlschool with all the comforts and
writer. Do yon think that Benton
County cau raise $27,500 per year
aud not have a tax on the people
that would be hard to get. I mean
hard for the tax payer to get. If.
you think we can raise $27,500 an
nually, why not levy the necessary
tax and iu 16 years we .would raise
$275,000 aud not be in debt. . The'
writer can not see where it shows
good judgment to vote bonds and;
pay interest on them that will eati
up the principal, that is, amount to.
more than the principal. We need J
the good roads but please don't'
vote bonds. .The amount sufficient'.
to pay the, interest would have to
be levied, so why net levy without!
bonds. ' "-

By mutual agreement the 'firm of Stigall Potts has dissolved, A. Potts, the fuuior
member of the firm, having purchased the interest of H. F. Stigall, senior member, in the stock:
of merchandise. We want to saj to the "public one-and all who have in any way, by trade or
influence, contributed to the great success df this well-known and popular establishment, that
words are inadequate to express our truest and most sincere appreciation for all the cooperation
given from the least child to the oldest citizen who has thus contributed, ; ' :
We have seemingly done our best to give good values, good good aud fair treatmeut to
aH alike, ; If we have done anyone an injustice, it was purely an error of the head and not of the
heart, for life is too short aud money too finite to deviate from the pathway of right,' and we feel "
that the business will continue on, the same high plane as' it has been conducted heretofore. Our
MrvU A. Potts will be sole proprietor, and we bespeak for him a liberal share of your patron-
age. Twenty-five years in business withoat a single change makes us one of .the oldest if not the ,
oldest firm in the county. . We have customers that began when we begau business aud they are '
'still appreciated customers. 'Sincerely your friends, ' , : A

Having purchased the stock of . merchandise of Stigall & Potts, I want to say in the be
ginning that I am now in a pesitiou to give you greater values for your money than probably
you have heretofore been getting, for the reason I will make'my priceeras low as the lowest for
