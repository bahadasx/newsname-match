' - Your readers have perhaps heard
v as much as they want to about New
v York City, but a few more words may
not hurt, especially as all Americans
ought to know something about the
, largest city in the world. When I
say that there were 75,000 deaths
here last year; that 400,000 children
are without full school privileges;
that four hundred millions of dollars
are invested in subways alone, and
that the assessed valuation of New
York City property is four thousand
, millions of dollars, you can begin to
concede of what the city is. Riitj
there are few people who can think
in billions. Counting as fast as could
be done, it would take 250 years to
' count one billion. -
Instead of saying ho much about
the hug metropolis, let us turn for
awhile to a country which is much
like Tennessee, as there are many na
tive Tennesseeans " there. That is
, Arkansas. You hear a good deal of
fun poked at the State, but I am here
to say that I found as much culture
there as anywhere in the South, and
and more than in some places farther
north. But up in the mountains you
find some curious specimens of human
ity, A wave of religious frenzy swept
over that section some years ago, i
while I was there. You could see
thin, long-haired men walking along
the roads, their eyes fixed upon
Bible carried in the hand, whispering
their prayers as they walked, and
women with strange lights iu their
. , eyes talking about "the second bless
ing" and "the language of th Holy
Ghost." Most of , these were plain,
evory-day harmless "Holiness" people,
honest and friendly as anybody, even
if a . little eccentric; others were
"Holy Rollers" or t'Holy Jumpers"
and but little removed from the mad'
house. . I Intend some day to describe
, a Holy Roller meeting 1 saw at Eureka
Springs, but it is my purpose todpy
to tell of a funny character I met in
the tnountains of northwestern Ark
. . ansas seven years ago while on gov-
r ernment business "
v , It became necessay to learn the
reputation for chastity and good mor
als of a certain woman whose husband,
- a pensioner," had deserted her
Through the testimony of the leading
citizens of the little town where she
lived, I found that she ; was upright
and moral, and infinitely : better than
, her husband who had tried to blacken
her character in order to keep her
from sharing his pension. The evi
, dence seemed unanimous that she
was above reproach in every way, till
. I met an old mountaineer, a brother
of the soldier. I asked him what the
woman's reputation was.
"Well, now, mister, you want the
truth, and you'll get it from me. Her
reputation is mighty bad, mighty
bad." . '. . . ,
TVhen prened for particulars, the
old fellow continued, snapping out his
words that must b9 heard to be ap
preciated. ' .
"Well, mistei-, I'll tell you one thing.
Same lime ago I was a-goin' along the
' road, andl8eenhera-comin't Thinks
I to myself, wVve had a, fallin out,
but I'm a goid' to be Christ-like and
speak to the pore critter. So I says
- when she coras up: . 'Howdy, Sally,
' howdy P jiat as polite and nice as I
knowed how. Don't you know, that
critter turned up. her nose and passed
by jist like was nothin' to her. Now,
youknow.no perfect Arkansas lady
would do anything like that."
"Is that all you. have to say against
-her?" .
'XVIister, that wasn't all she done.
' 'Slid of answerin' me like a lady, she
goes to knockin' the backstep on me."
"What was that? Explain yourself ."
, "Mister, that's a sort of hateful
-o ance people takes when x they haiut
got no use for ye; they sorter dance
' backerds and kick up the dust. Now,
, you know no perfect Arkansas lady"
, - "Is that all you have to say against
that woman?" '
"Indeed hit haiot, mister! Me and
my wife Sarepta passed her house
awhile after that, and seen her on the
porch; we both spoke to her jist as
nice and friendly as we knowed how.
And do you think that critter opened
"her mouth? Stid of that, she com
menced a-knockin' the backstep right
thar oa the porch"
"My dear sir," said I, "you will have

to show something more serious than
that to keep the woman from getting
a pension." - :
"I'm a comin' to that, mister! Jist
you wait a minute. You know my
brother is a Holiness. He never done
no wrong in hia life, and he, being
sanctified, and got the second blessin',
hit was jist naturally impossible for
him to sin. And ye know them there
Holinesses can't stand the sound of
no musical instrument, 'cazo hit's an
abomination unto the Lord. Well,
that there woman went and bought a
parlor orgin, and the first thing my
pore brother knowed, they had it sot
up in the house."
"What?"
"She shore did. You hear me. And
tney Kept junin' on tnat tnere orgin
as late as nine or ten o'clock at night,
when all honest people was in bed.
And my pore brother, him.bein' a
Holiness,; couldn't stand anything
like that and they jist pintadly drove
him away from his own home. Now,'
mister, you know that wernt right.",
"So that was the worst she did?"
"No hit wernt, mister! She jist
bodaciously broke my brother up! She
run hoe-downs over him, that's what
she doneT
"Ran hoe-downs aver him? You
will have to explain yourself.. The
government never heard of hoe-downs
before." -
"Now, mister. Til tell you what a
hoe-down is. Hit's one of the lowest
down, commonest, set-firedestvulgar-esest
dances you ever beam tell of.
Hit's somethin' like waltzin' if yon
know what that is," he added, looking
around and speaking low. "That
there hoe-down dancin' and that orgin
junin' kept np away into- the night,
and my pore brother a-sittin' and a
sorrowin and a-whittlin' splinters oat
on the wood-pile, and the tears a
streamin' down his face like he bad
loit his best friend. Mister, he loved
his little family T This with a chok

were only eleven in the family, so his
love must have been great, I thought.
"But she drove him off. No Holiness
could stand that orgin-noise and that
devilish hoe-down business. Mister,
I .never seen hit myself, nor would I
ever look at sich bell-fired doins"
"Is that all . you can' say against
your brother's wife?"
"Well, haint that enough?"
- I saw that the old man was getting
excited, and calmned him down with
the assurance that I certainly was
shocked, and would see what could be
done. It is hardly necessary to say
that the woman got her pension. Ev
idence in the case showed that she
was an angel of light compared to the
old man himself, who, in spite of his
holiness, was anything but an angel.
Another old chap I met in Johnson
county, Arkansas, got so full of the
holiness idea that he had, as he
thought, regular communion with the
Almighty. One day,' he announced,
God commanded him to give a beating
to another old fellow who had been
crippled when his house blew down in
a hurricane. The holy one met his
neighbor going to Clarksville, pulled
him out and pommeled him within an
inch of his life. The old victim had
two stalwart sons in Clarksville, who,
when they heard of the exploit, looked
up His Holiness and beat him, with ax
handles, till he could scarcely get
home. In the court he explained that
he had beaten up his neighbor by com
mand of the Lord. The boys defend
ed themselves by saying that they got
their orders direct from Old Scratch.
The judge thought that evened things
up, and discharged them all with a
warning to "go and sin no more."
These same people would take you
in and treat you like a brother if you
came among them as a stranger, and
not stop to aBk you how much money
you had. That is, if they do not live
very close to a railroad. Somehow,
the iron of the rails enters the soul
of man, Lpjdsat S. Perkins.
