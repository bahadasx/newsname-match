SNOW STORM IN CASCADES
Of UNPRECEDENTED SEVERITY
Eight Feet in Eight Hours, 24 feet Inside Thirty Hours-Four
and Half feet all Over Puget Sound Country
WORST SNOW STORM SINCE OffICAL RECORD KEPT
AH Transcontinental Railroads Tied Up—Eight feet Deep in the Upper Wenat
chee Valley-flood Dangers Must Be Reckoned With
From a time when the memory of
the oldest inhabitant in this part of the
country runs not to the contrary a
snow storm began last Monday noon
and ended Wednesday night that for
precipitation has never been equaled.
For almost forty-eight hours snow fell
continually without a moment's let up.
The snow fall here from Monday noon
to Thursday night at 12, 60 hours, was
32 inches. In the same time the fall
at the »ummit, where the G. N. track
crosses the mountains, the fall was 288
inches. On Tuesday 8 feet of snow
fell in as many hours. Everett and
Seattle reported a snow fall Wednes
day afternaon of four feet, to which
another half foot was added the same
evening and night, which was followed
by rain. All over the western country
from southern Alaska to California the
earth was covered with a blanket of
snow of varying depth from one foot to
thirty feet. There is no record of any
such widespread snow storm since first
the weather bureau was established
forty years ago. Every transcontinen
tal railroad was tied up from Monday
for periods of time from two to five
days with the prospect that the Great
Northern will not be opened for travel
for the next four or five days, or from
Monday to Wednesday or Thursday of
the coming week, with the possibility
that it may be tied up for ten days or
two weeks longer. It was a storm of
such unusual severity that there is no
way of making comparisons or comput
ing the time that will be required to
open the road. With the amount of
snow in the bills the possibilities of
slides of monster proportions develop
ing is great and there is no way at this
this time of telling howing long it will
take to clear them up. The great
trouble just now with the railroad is to
find a way of wasting the snow that
must be plowed off the tracks. The
snow on each side of the track is in
many places thirty and forty feet high
and the snow plows are incapable of
throwing the new snow high enough
to clear these banks.
The snow storm began just after the
longest cold spell of the winter —after
the thermometer had stood about zero
or 20 below for thirty days. The snow
now lies on the ground at this point to
a depth of almost seven feet.
Conditions on the Northern Pacific
and the Milwaukee roads are almost as
desperate as On the Great Northern.
Since last Sunday the only communica
tion between the east and west side of
the mountains was by way of the Spo
kane, Portland and Seattle road, which
follows the bank of the Columbia river,
and even this road was threatened with
a snow tie-up. The southern part of
the state suffered almost as much as
the central and northern part of the
state from this unprecedented storm.
It it impossible for people living
more than a mile from town to get
here. There is no communication by
wagon load with any of the towns down
the valley. The Great Northern rail
road is running one train a day in
here from Spokane. Arriving here in
the evening at 5:30 and leaving in
the morninsr at 3:30. No train has
gone west from here since last Mon
day night at 12 o'clock.
In round numbers there is a million
K re»of land in the Wenatchee river

watershed, and if a warm wave hit the
country and endured for ten days or
two weeks, as is not unusual at this
time of year, the canyon of the Wenat
chee river could not carry all the water
that would come down it. There is
about five times as much snow in the
hills at this time as there has been any
time in the past twenty years. The
flood dangers can scarcely be exagger
ated and it would be well to keep this
in mind.
The snowstorm which hit the north
west coast of North America the night
of Jan. 31st and lasted from 48 to 60
hours was without doubt the worst,
most widespread and destructive that
ever hit this country since the white
man came. It extended from southern
Alaska to northern California, covering
1000 miles of the interior. In places
the snow fell at the rate of over a foot
an hour —reaching in the mountains a
depth of over twenty feet, and else
where from one to four feet. Fuel
shortage is reported from many points.
All railroads were paralyzed and all
wires down from 12 to 60 hours, some
for four days. Schools closed, street
railways stopt running and all traffic
was suspended.
Following is a news summary for
Feb. 2nd:
Victoria, B. C. —Worst storm in over
SO years; 4 foot snow and still falling.
Stores and schools closed; no street
cars running.
Fuel shortage and other bad condi
tions thruout Idaho and Montana.
Seattle—The dome of the 82,000,
--000 Catholic cathedral fell in from
the weight of snow, doing damage esti
mated at 8100,000.
Portland —Conditions frightful. All
railroad traffic suspended; schools are
closed; street cars stopt; many acci
dents.
Wednesday, Feb. 2— Great North
ern, Northern Pacific, Oregon Short
Line, Milwaukee, and even Spokane,
Portland & Seattle were closed to
traffic. The latter was opened again
today.
Bellingham —High wind is drifting
the snow rapidly and traffic virtually
stopped. Schools close. Food and
fuel is short.
Boise —Train service suspended on
all branches of the short line. Street
cars stopped and coal famine threatens.
Walla Walla —Business halts, schools
close, street cars stop, theaters dark,
funerals postponed, roofs cave in, no
rural mail, fire department helpless;
three feet of snow.
Wenatchee —Chelan region is par
alized; locomotion by road vehicle or
train stops; 24 inches of snow in city,
deeper in country. Fuel shortage.
Have You Registered?
This is to call your attention to the
fact that you can not vote tnis year un
less you are registered twenty days be
fore any election. The election for a
school director will occur on the first
Saturday in March. There are just
nine days left in which to register for
this election, wherefore it behooves
you to get busy if you want to vote for
school director in the March election.
Fuel shortage does not menace this
town. It may cause some inconven
ience but there will be no suffering.
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, February 4, 1916
Douglas County Man Kills 115 Hogs
A dispatch in the Wenatchee World
from Mansfield, dated Jan. 31, states
that E. J. Carroll shot 115 head of
hogs during the worst part of the
storm. The pigs were crowding into
the pens and smothering, and nothing
could be done to care for or feed them
so he took his gun and put them out
of their misery. He estimates the loss
would not be heavier than if he had
fed them dollar wheat and had to sell
at the present market price, Some of
the pigs weighed over 100 pounds.
They were hauled out into the field
and will be buried in the spring.
GREAT WAR'S EFfKT
ON LUMBER PRICES
Halts Improvement and Necessary Build
ing That Will Cause Demand
After Conflict Ends
A copy of the Aberdeen (Scotland)
Free Press, a city with 100,000 inhabi
tants was handed to The Echo one day
this week by W. Mclntosh. The Free
Press finds that the war has had a de
pressing effect on building operations
of every kind. Not only because the
citizens of Great Brittain find it neces
sary to economize to meet the higher
war taxes which hits all alike, but be
cause the price of lumber has risen
enormously, due to the high price of
ocean freight rates and the government
order for all ships to give preference to
war material.
Su great has been the scarcity of
lumber that the native forests have
been drawn on for much needed lum
ber. Something which never would
have been done but for the dire neces
sity. This doubtless indicates the con-'
dition all over Europe, from which can
be drawn the rational conclusion that
after the war is over there will be a
large demand for lumber of every kind.
Great Brittain has for many years drawn
heavily on the timber of Sweden aud
Norway, but this stock is wholly insuf
ficient to meet the great demand after
the war coones to an end. The United
States and Canada will be called on to
supply Europe with her lumber needs
and for this reason The Echo confi
dently predicts that great prosperity
will surely come to our lumber indus
tries and that it will continue indefi
nitely. The price of lumber will ad
vance rapidly with the first indications
of peace.
The Scotch paper adds that the price
of foreign lumber has rison 70 per
cent since the war began, and that the
prospects for 1916 point to still higher
prices.
As showing how the war affected
lumber shipments to Aberdeen these
figures are given:
American timber, 1914,6,785 loads;
1915 none. British and European,
1914, 63,604 loads; 1915, 27,000
loads.
To Clear Up Uncertainties in
the Dry Law
Chelan county's prosecuting attorney
is to go to Olympia to meet other at
attorneys and together with the attor
ney general go over the state wide pro
hibition law and clear up the many
doubtful places in that losely drawn
enactment, one of which is whether
one has the right to get two quarts ol
liquor and twelve quarts of beer. The
cumulative "and" and the alternative
"or" has given some of the auditors
trouble. The Chelan county officer
has refused to give any one applicant a
permit for both the liquor and beer,
while other counties have interpreted
the law to entitle the applicant to both.
There are other ambiguities, how
ever, which need clarifying.

JANUARY SNOWFALL
AND TEMPERATURE
Almost as Much Snow in January, 1916,
as Winter of 1914-15—Seventeen
Days of Zero Temperature
The extraordinary severity of the
weather this winter and the still more
extraordinary snowfall up to this time
makes the weather topic one of un
usual interest. Below is given the
temperature and snowfall record for
January 1916, by days, with a compar
ative record of the snowfall for the
winter of 1914-15 by months, and the
snow fall this winter by months up to
and including Feb. 3. The figures
are finished by Dr. A. G. McKeown,
the local U. S. weather observer.

The above table shows temperatures
of zero and below zero for seventeen
days of the month. On the mildest
day, the 23rd, a Chinook wind pre
vailed and reduced the snow levels
about ten inches.

give below the snowfall during the
winter of 1914-15 by months, and the
total, and the snowfall for the winter of
1915-16 by months, and the total up

The Hard Times Dance
The members of the 0. E. S. lodge
gave a hard-times dancing party in the
Masonic hall Wednesday evening. A
large crowd attended and everyone
pronounced it a most enjoyable affair.
A prize was awarded to the couple
making the toughest "hard-times"
showing. Doctor and Mrs. Judah won
in a walk, to use race-track lingo.
They looked the part so well that some
body suggested that a collection be
tak^n up for them.
Rotary Stuck in Snow.
A snow plow and engine has been
stuck in a snow bank three miles west
of Leavenworth since Tuesday. Yes
terday a rotary was brought .rom Spo
kane and last night went out to relieve
and liberate the two crews. The en
gine and rotary was kept alive.

Since the price of wheat reached the
dollar level considerable Washington
wheat has been sold. A very consid
erable amount of the 1915 crop is still
in the hands of the growers.
The Birth of Every Child Should be Re
corded
In reply to advice from the board of
health of Washington that the birth of
her baby had not been recorded a
Bellingham woman wrote, "I have had
seven babies and no one ever before
asked me to go thru this foolishness."
When the woman wanted to leave the
country to go abroad she was prevented
from leaving because she could not
show the birth certificate of her child.
There are hundreds of reasons why this
is necessary. No foolishness about it.
An American recently had two sons go
to Canada and enlist. They were un
der age, yet because she could not
show birth certificates showing they
were American born they were not
turned loose.
NATIONAL fORESTS NOW
NO LONGER FOREST RESERVE
Increase in Timber Value and Intelligent
Administration Adds to State's
Revenue
It does not seem to be generally
known that the term "Forest Reserves"
is no longer legal or official. This
name was changed by act of congress
March 4, 1901, to "National Forests,"
to indicate that these resources were
not locked up as "reserves" for the
distant future, but were to be adminis
tered for the greatest good of tl.e
greatest number now.
The first allotment of national forest
money made to Oregon and Washing
ton in 1910, after the passage of the
act which gave the states a share of the
national forest revenue, was $7,565 for
Oregon and $1,823 for Washington.
In 1915 Oregon's share of this revenue
was $49,675, and Washington's was
$37,445. The constantly increasing
demand for national forest timber as
sures a much higher rate of increase in
the next few years, and ultimately the
states will receive a large revenue from
this source.
Of the approximately 490,000 acres
of school land within the national for
ests of Washington,233.ooo acres have
thus far been cruised as a preliminary
step in the exchange of these lands for
a solid block of national forest land of
equal area and equal value. Upon the
completion of the cruise of the school
lands it will then be necessary to cruise
an equal area of land to give to the
state in exchange for the school lands.
The cruising work is being done un
der a cooperative agreement between
the federal government and the state
of Washington.
Delightful Musical Entertain
ment
The Musical Entertainers, three
young ladies, Miss Hockinson, violin;
Miss Garten, singer and reader, and
Miss Ingram, reader and singer, gave
very pleasing entertainment to a large
audience in the Scenic theatre last Fri
day evening. The first two numbers
on the program, a vocal solo by Miss
Garten and a violin solo by Miss Hock
inson capturad the audience. Miss
Garten nas an excellent voice and ac
complished the higher notes with per
fect ease. Her's is easily the best
trained voice it has been our pleasure
to listen to in Leavenworth. She was,
roundly applauded and responded with
a simple melody. Miss Hockinson's
violin selection was a difficult piece of
music well rendered, and might have
been played with more expression had
she not suffered with benumbed fin
gers. The evening was very cold and
the stage was woefully lacking in
warmth. Miss Ingam's recitations
were delightfully droll and often pleas
ing. The ladies of the Kumtux Club,
who by the way brought the entertain
ers to the city, have our thanks for, to
our mind, the best entertainment we
have had in Leavenworth.
The Lutheran Ladies Aid will meet
next Thursday afternoon, Feb. 10, at
the home of Mrs. Fred Ahlin. A cor
dial invitation to all.

POLITICAL DOPE
BY A POLITCIAN
"County Chairman" Has Started the Ball
—Candidates Backward About
Coming Forward
The moratorious "County Chairman"
in Tuesday's Wenatchee World started
the political ball rolling by mentioning
some "willin' Barkis' " who are ready
to sacrifice themselves on the altar of
public duty. The crop of county can
didates bids fair to be large in Wenat
chee. If any one in this section har
bors designs on a county office he is
keeping very still. Tho doubtless
there be some so foolish as to believe
there is a chance to elect a man to of
fice outside of Wenatchee.
"C. C." predicts that Judge Grim
shaw will be a candidate to succeed
himself for the superior court judgship,
and mentions A. N. Corbin, W. O.
Parr and Fred Kemp as possible aspir
ants for judicial honors. The gratui
tous observation is here ventured that
the man who beats Biil Grimshaw to
the coming-out place will have to go
some.
The sheriffs office, says "C. C,"
will be the chief bone of contention in
the primaries, and Chief of Police In
scho, Deputy Sheriff Huff, of Wenat
chee, and ex-Deputy Burt McMaaus,
of Cashmere, will be in the running.
Charley Harlan made no canvass to
speak of two years ago and came
mighty near getting the nomination.
Few men are more favorably and bet
ter known than Charley, and if he de
cides to again heave his hat in the
ring he would be a rash man who
would undertake to predict the out
come.
U. G. Poage, A. Paptie and Frank
Palmer are to strive for C. E. Buttles'
shoes, who is disqualified, having served
the county two terms in succession.
Auditor Ross, not being disqualified,
will try again for the auditorship of the
county. "C. C," presumably a re
publican, does not suggest a demo
cratic candidate for this position.
J. W. Sussex, of Peshastin, and Fred
Berry, once county engineer, will di-.
vide the votes for this particular office,
the present incumbent, Mr. Warren,
being ineligible as he has served two
terms.
Hon. Frank Reeves, he says, will
not be a candidate to succeed himself
as representative in the legislature from
Chelan county. For this important
but poorly paid office a long string of
names is suggested as possible candi
dates, among them our fellow towns
man, Mr. John B. Adams, George
Brown of Chelan. M. E. Field of Ste
heking, and P. W. Lawrence and Sam
R. Sumner of Wenatchee. Some of
those named have not yet fully decided
whether they want to be representative
or joint senator from Chelan and Kit
titas county.
Mr. Flummerfelt, of Ellensburg, is
the present representative in the state
senate from these two counties. Await
ing his decision to try again candidates
who have their eye on this position are
backward about announcing their can
didacy.
"C. C." gives Hon. John G. Lewis,
of Aberdeen, quite a boost lor governor,
but as some eight or ten are known to
have gubernatorial aspirations there is
little significance in Mr. Lewis' an
nouncement at this time. There is a
possibility that eastern Washington
might land a governor if the republican
voters would consolidate on one man.
In the candidacy of W. J. Sutton, em
inently qualified in every way, there is
an opening for just such a landing.
If the republican voters of eastern
Washington can be brought to see the
importance of concentrating their bal
lots on him, and the benefit that would
result therefrom Mr. Sutton stands an
excellent chance of getting the repub
lican nomination.
