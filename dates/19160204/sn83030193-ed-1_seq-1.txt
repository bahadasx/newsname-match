"You Must Not Attempt to Humil

State Zimmermann "There Are
Limits Which Snap Friendship."
GERMAN PAPERS TALK
OF BREAK WITH THE U. S.
WASHINGTON, Fob. . President Wilson returned
to the capital from his Western speaking tVip shortly after
1.15 o'clock this afternoon. lie went at once to the White
louse, ...
Te reiid the Berlin despalcltes on the .situation while
his train was running between Baltimore and Washington.
He made no comment, but members of his party said they
regarded the .situation as " unfavorable."
BERLIN, via London, Fob. 4. Information reaching
the Associated Press to-duy indicates that .under no cir
cumstances will Germany admit that the sinking of the
Lusilaiiia was an illegal act.
The new instructions forwarded lo Ambassador von Uernstorff,
according lo this information, contains simply one phase of the new
formulation of the uroposcd note of regret for the sinking of the Ltisi
ilaiiia. The suggested sentence is short, consisting of onlv eight words.
and does not contain the word "illegal." It represents the extreme limit
of Germany's concessions in the Ltisitania case.
The view is entertained here that one of the most serious crises of
the war has arisen in connection with tlie l.tisitani.i case, and that it is Im
possible to foresee the outcome from any indications here. The result of
the negotiations appears to hinge solely on the one word "illegal." In
the way of an agreement between the United Stales and Germany stand
only these seven letters.
Dlt. ZIMMERMANN SAYS SITUATION IS CRAVE.
Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in
an interview with the Associated Press, expressed the hope that the new
formula forwarded to Ambassador von Uernstorff would offer a possi
ble basis of settlement. Hut he injtle no eftort to conceal the gravity of
the situation and was mot explicit in lib statements that Germany had
reached the extreme limit ol concessions, and under no circumstances
would concede the illegality of her submarine campaign in the war area.
"The Government is willing to do everything in
iU power, and has done everything in its power, lo
meet American wishes," he said, "but there are limits
beyond whicirevcn friendship, snaps. I do not un
derstand America's course. We had thought the
submarine issue settled, and the Lusitania question
on the way lo arrangement--had agreed to pay
indemnity and all that when Ihe t'niled States sud
denly made its new demands, which il is impossible for
us lo accept. You must not push your demands loo
far. You must not attempt lo humiliate Germany."
SAYS GERMANY HAS CONE THE LIMIT.
I)t. Zimmermann declined b discuss these u.'w Jeni.'.i.ls or th:
, instructions to lauint vmi Uerns'.nrtt mure precisely, but he left nodoubt
I that the whole crisis centred on .secretary Lansing's demand that Ger
; main disavow the sinking ui the I.usit.inia an act cjnlrary to Inter
national law. The Under-becreurv declared repeatedly that Germany
could not possibly admit this procedure was illegal or make concessions
which virtually would take the submarine weapon out of her hand.
He asserted again and again that if the United States desired to
DEAL 1
