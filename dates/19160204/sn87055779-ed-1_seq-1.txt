SCHOOL HEAD
IS ENDORSED
Bl PRINCIPALS
Progressive Methods Intro
duced by L. J. Montgomery
Are Incorporated in
Endorsement.
SUMMER SCHOOL IS
ONE OF HIS IDEAS
All Are in Favor of Having
Him Returned For Another
Term Night Schools
Are Encouraged.
Signed by principals of the grade
schools, an endorsement of 1. J.
Montgmery, superintemlent of
schools, ha. been addressed to the
citizens of oiith IJend. It points
j out the progressive steps that have
been taken in th city schools dur
ing the 'last four years and shows
that educators who have signed it,
favor the reappointment vf Mr.
Montgomery.
c-ch)ol work in every line has
been improved, according to the
principals' endorsement. In January,
H13, manual training was intro
duced in the seventh grades for all
boys in th city schools. Pefore this
it had not been given below the
tighth grade. At the same time
promotion by subjects instead of by
grade was inaugurated in the eighth
grade. Departmental teaching had
existed for many years previous to
this, but up to that time a pupil
was promoted in all subjects or
none.
Started Summer Schools,
During the .summer of lUlo summer
school was held for the first time
upon the reeommmlation of Supt.
Montgomery. Enrollment for the
first summer was L',44t5,with a daily
attendance of i.TTo. During that
time, 920 pupils made up work who
otherwise woujil have taken it over
during the second semester. A total
of i." high school credits were earn
ed. According to the endrsement,
this sael the school city aoout
$7.0 oo.
With the opening of school in the
fall of l!l:;. an industrial F:hool
was establishe! in the old eighth
! grade building on W. Washington
' av. In the first year 3S boys were
enrolletl, many of whom had become
discouraged with school and con-
tinued only in this work. Many of
j tllPm h;ul l,ecome difficult problems
n discipline, relieving the ward
' build inus of these cases.
I Practical courses along with the
regular school work were establish
ed at Kaley school in January, Dili.
Past ieconls showed that very few
pupils frm that school entered high
schd. localise they left sch(ol at
an early age to help support the
family. Housekeeping was offered
to th girls in the fifth, sixth and
seventh grailes. sewing ami co khm
being alternated ever week. 1'or
the boys half of the time was de
voted to shop wirk and drawing, the
remaimier of the day being spent
upon academic work. The courses
in arithmetic and language were
made more practical. This plan
was adopted after Mr. Montgomery
had i?ited schools of the same kind
in Philadelphia. Hochester. Cleve
land and Detroit. Since the system
has been in operation, the enrollment
in the grads above the compulsory
age limit has increase.! 5 4 per cent,

entire first floor of the hotel was in

documents, however, had been car
ried from tb library by members of
the 77th regiment befort. the tire
reached them.
Help was calle! from Montreal,
but the combined efforts of the Ot
tawa and Montreal firemen could not
stay the headway of the flames.
Two of the missing are Mme.
Morin of Beauce. and Mme. Bray of
Montreal, who were guests of the
wife of Speaker Zvigny.
Several men were reported to have
been killed when one of the stone
walls of the building collapsed.
William S. Loggie, member of
parliament frm New Brunswick,
was said to be missing.
Many persons were injured and
were rushed to various hospitals.
Many Narrow 1 ". es;.
There were many narrow escapes
as the fire spread so rapidly that
some of the persons hi the building
were trapped and had to fight their
way through blinding smoke.
Minister of Agriculture Burrill
was overcome as he was making his
way through the thickest of the
tsmoke and fell unconscious, but was
dragged to safety.
The Duke of Connaught. governor-general
of Canada, rushed to
the scene in an automobile and in
sisted on helping the firemen.
Premier Borden announced that
parliament would continue in ses
sion despite the loss of the building.
The members were notified to be
ready to assrmhle at o'clock thi-
afternoon either in Russell theat-r
or the government offices (,t' the
board of railway commissioners.
Among the works of value de
stroyed were paintings presented to
parliament by Queen Victoria and
King Edward.
Gen. Sir Sam Hughes, minister of
militia for Canada, assisted in the
direction of the fire fighting fore?.
He called out the 77th regiment,
which is in training hero, and the
men were s-t at work rescuing trap
ped persons in th building, carrying
out books and documents and as
sisting the firemen in other ways.
.'i:u;a rvot inctl.
In the meantime the minister of
militia notified the militia authori
ties ail along the border to watch
for persons trying to leave the coun
try surreptitiously.
A number of newspaper corre
spondents were caught in th press
gallery by the onrush of flames and
saved themselves by climbing down
extension lid'Iers w.iich the firemen
raised to the windows.
Conflicting report"? were circulated
as to th- f a e of Chief Libr-ral Whip
Partlee, whr, was in his s-at in com
mons when an excited messT.er
dashed into the chamber shouting:
"Fire; Fire! Run for your livfs."
Mr. Parde- like many others in
the chamber, did not recognize the
full extent of the danger and was
slow in attempting to make his es
cape. Many of the legislators after mak
ing their way from the building,
gave such aid as they -ouhl to the
firemen. Some f these paid for
their devotion with M-rious injuries.
