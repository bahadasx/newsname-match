Joe Bryson, fat man, good fellow
and old-timer, who has been riding
the ranges of the southwest these
man; years, was never suspected of
harboring a secret In his life, but a
recent discovery on the part of his
friends has revealed something that
even those closest to him never sus-
peeled. ,
Joe owns a ranch down on Ten-Mile
creek, southwest of Reaver, and has
always posed as acat'le baron among
the peoole who knew him. But the
unprecedented air of prosperity that
has hovered over him during the last
few months lias made even his friends
regard him with suspicion, and a few
decided to find out Its source. Joe is
very reticent by nature and one al
most has to use a stomach pump or
a corkscrew to get any information
out of him regarding his personal af
i fairs, hut once in a while he would
f couuesceiiu wj Dpean uuuut a pros
pect hole" he owned out in Arizona,
and he always carried such a mysteri
ous air when saying anything ahout
it that J. E. George, Jim Maloney,
and a few other local capitalists tried
to buy an interest in tne same., The
fact that he shows up at the First
National Bank of Liberal every once
In so often with a good sized bag of
gold dust served to add to the won
derment of its source, and his friends
were beginning to think it was a se
cret that would go down in silence to
t.hft crave with him I
Everyone overshoots his mark, how
ever, sooner or later, and Joe's invi
tation of a few friends' to his ranch
last week proved tils undoing, and
has further proved that the gold
mine was loc tied on the ranch In
stead of Arizona. A few years ago
Joe bought several pairs of ducks and
placed them on the ranch, with the
freedom of that part of the Ten Mile
that' traverses the same. These
ducks swim in the cretik and occasion
ally dive down a'ter a bill full of
mud; this mud happens to be liberal
ly sprinkled with gold dust, which
sticks in their crops (or craws, if you
like that belter), and when Joe runs
short of money lie rounds up" tifteen
.'or twenty ducks, kills them and re
Y moves the contents or their crops ( i
Acraws), pans out the proceeds In an
J old skillet, sacks it up and brings il
to the First National bank, where it
is dulv credited to Ids account, and
thus Joe Is always lousv with money
and only has to work enough to get up
an appetite. The on'y regretalde
part of the whole performance, as Joe
gees It, Is that the goid only runs
about twenty dollars to the duck, and
lie has to go slow at slaughtering
time or his herd might give out.
The reason lie went there last week
was In hopes lie might be able, with
the snow on the ground, to track the
ducks to the location of the gold,
but they're wise old ducks and rer
ma'ned perfectly stationary until be
got nearly to Beaver.

Beaver County's Oil Well
There is considerable excitement
over In Beaver county these days re
garding the reported finding of oil
near Oate. Last week's Forgan
Eagle had the following account of
it: "The visitors at the Gate oil
well Sunday met and talked with R.
B. Rutherford, president, and G. O.
Wilcox, secretary of the oil com
pany, and these officers took partic
ular pains to tell our people about
the excitement that had been on
there regarding the claim of so:ne
that oil had been struck. They tell
us that the reports that had been
circulated about oil being struck was
not authorized by any one In charge.
They say, however, that to the ones
not familiar with the oil, could easily
take what was taken out of the well
for oil and that there was a great
many who was positive It was oil.
The officers of the company and the
drillers all agree that they have
every indication of oil, and they
firmly believe if they can go to 2,500
or 3,000 feet they will strike It.

THE PEOPLES STATE BANK
After the hole is put down another
1,000 feet they will, if they do not
strike oil, pull the casing back to
the 1,250 foot mark and shoot the
well. The well drill, was not wont
ing Sunday. for the reason that the
company was waiting for casing,
which they expected to arrive Tues
day, and they expected to get to
drilling Tuesday night.
"Later: Telephone advice from
G. G. Wilcox of Gate at 9 p. m.
Wednesday night was to the effect
that the casing for the oil well had
been received and the drill started
that evening." .
If it Is a fact that the soil of
Beaver county Is underlaid with a
strata of oil there I no reason to
doubt that something like that could
exist In Seward county, or at least
near enough, to benefit the town of
Liberal. " The whole state of Kan-
fas seems to be going wild over oil
j or the prospects of finding it, and
we might as well Jump in and try
to start something down here.

Watches!
On the subject of
watches we desire to speak
plainly and franklv fur
the reason that few peo
ple who buy watches know
much aliout them. In
the majority of cases they
set a limit of expenditure
without definite know
ledge of watch values.
If you are considering
the purchase of a watch,
our advice Is that you buy
the best watch you can a'ford there Is no economy In buying a
heap watch; it means continued trouble and annoyance; whereas
a watch well '..ought will give a lifetime of service and satisfac
tion. When we, sell you a watch It Is part of the transaction for us to
see to It that It's performance is equal . In every respect to the
promise made for It.
We are headquarters for
Howard, Hamilton, Elgin and Waltham Watches
We carry In stock a good selection to choose from take our
advice next time and buy a REAL WATCH-You will never re
gret it.
