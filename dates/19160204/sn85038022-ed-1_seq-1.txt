HOBBIES
A prominent physician tells us that "hobbies" are healthy
H things for us to have, ami we fed that wo must be blessed with
JJ unusually good health, as we have ALWAYS had a hobby
and it's
HARNESS!
JJ Years ago, when leather sold for nineteen cents a pound,
our boast was that we made the best harness that could be
made of good leather, good thread and good workmanship.
Now, when that same kind of leather is selling for forty-nine
and fifty cents a pound, we still maintain that wc have tho
best harness that can be made. All you have to do to provo
that we are telling you "facts is to go to the next "sale," and
hear Col. Ilcnsley Hawkins say in that musical drawl for which
he is so famous, "This is a set, gentlemen, of Mike Brown's
Harness. What do you bid?" Then's when you can see tho
farmer "set up and take notice." for he knows there will bo
some bidding on that harness.
This is the time of tho year, when Harness is foremost in
every farmer's mind, and this is the time of tho year, also,
when we arc ready to soli him. All winter long our men have
been making up harness for Spring trade, and now wo are
ready. Of course, it's higher than wliun our grandfather
lined to buy it, but, considering the price of leather, it's a
wonder how low in price and high in quality tho Square Deal
harness is,
Come in, gentlemen, wo are ready to rig up those horses,

PHENOMENAL GROWTH OF COMPANY
THAT OPERATES IN SINGLE STATE
KENTUCKY CENTRAL LIFE AND ACCIDENT HAS POLICY OP
FAIRNESS THAT INSPIRES CONTINUED CONFIDENCE,
It must bo a great Inccntlvo for restricted territory, .Messrs. Walker
tboso Just beginning in tho Industrial ami West wcro among tho first to ap-
llfn nnrlrlont nn.l hnalth business to re- I'reciaio mo puuuc cuucauon in insur
view tho history of tho Kentucky Cen
tral LI fa and Accident Insurance Com
pany of Louisville, Ky., which has had
A rcmarkablo career, for which entire
credit Is duo President P. J. Walker
and Secretary-Treasurer T. O. West.
Tho company was organized In Sep
tember, 1902, nnd has a perpetual char
ter. Beginning with llttlo aside from
sclf-confldcnco In their ability to suc
cessfully direct an Institution of this
character, Messrs. Walker and West
now find themselves at tho head of a
company which is writing probably the
largest business of Its kind In a single
State. Jt Is needless to say that had
they not dcalth with unusual fairness
with policyholders thoy could not have
Inspired bo much confldcnco nor could
tho company have continued growing
In such a phenomenal way.
Tho Kentucky Central Life nnd Ac
cident Is mutual In spirit as well ns lu
fact, and tho officers feel it their duty
to treat tho members liberally and to
pay claims with the utmost dispatch.
Despite this policy Is loss ratio is not
abnormal. In 1914 tho premium in
come In Kentucky, In which state it
operates exclusively, was $576,721.60,
and during that year tho company paid
over CD.000 weekly sick and accident
and 1,322 death claims.
So effective Is Its policy that Instead
of having to seek agents the Kentucky
Central Life and Accident has more
applications than It can care for. Its
men nro prosperous and arc largely of
that clean, young, nggrcsslvo type
which Is a characteristic of the offi
cers themselves.
Although the company operates In a
janco nnd Immediately took advantage
of tho opportunity offered to partici
pate lu tho Collective Insurance nnd
Universal Safety Exhibit nt tho Pann-ma-l'aclflc

of tho Kentucky Central Life and Acci
dent, Comnilbslonor Clay of Kentucky,
In ono of the most scal-chlng of ex
aminations said In parti
An Investigation of tho com
plaints filed by policyholders with
tho management show that tho
company gives special nnd prompt
attention to same, forwarding
them nt once to tho superintend
ents for Investigation, with In
structions to settlo samo Imme
diately If found meritorious.
Tho death claims nro principally
settled lu tho field by the superin
tendents, but tho policy, premium,
receipt book, proof of death and
receipt of payment arc turned Into
the homo olllce for tho flics.
Your examiners nro glad to say
In their belief that tlic company's
treatment of policyholders Is be
yond criticism.
Wo have found tho books In an
excellent condition, and must com
mend the bookkeeper for accuracy
and neatness.
Wo found the uinuagemeut ex

tho president, F. J. Walker, and
the secretary. J. O. West, for their
earnest nnd constant, nttention to
the company's business.
Tho company Is economically man

and confidence of those with whom
the have dealings.
