lice gave out a statement this after
noon stating that the-destruetion cf the

caused... by . an Incendiary but un
doubtedly started from flies of old
newspapers in. the library. The fire
was first discovered when it had
climbed to the eaves ot that section of
the .buildinir used for tho library.
The explosions which have been fe
ported from apparent bombs, tending
to prove malicious destruction on the
part of the country's enemies, have
been minimized by the olficials. Al
though the fire is believed to have
started in the library section, the li
brary was saved.

they have their lives.
Jt has been established that the first
burst of ilame in the reading room of
the house of commons was preceded
by at least one explosion and probab
ly by two. The force of tho concus
sion was so severe that persons stand
ing some distance away were hurled
to the floor.
A rigid investigation to determino
the cause of the lire already has been
started by the Dominion authorities.
Tho flames spread with sucli amaz
ing rapidity that the Ottawa fire bri
gade was utterly iielpless to cope
with them and aid was sent from Mon
treal.
Tho loss is set at $10,000,000 not in
cluding the value of many very valu
able books and official documents.
:,Irs. Alphonse Vervill wire of a
well known labor member, says slie
was in the commons reading room
when all of a sudden there was a light
explosion, followed by a fire that
seemed to sweep through the room as
if tho floors had been saturated with
oil.
Legislators who were in the build
ing experienced great difficulty in
groping their way through smoke
filled corridors. Several fled through
windows and down ladders to the
street.
The entire fire fighting equipment
of Ottawa was unable to cope with
the flames and Mayor Martin of Mon
treal, a member of parliament at 10
o'clock ordered the Montreal fire bri
gade to this city.
Half an hour after the fire was dis
covered the glass roof over the com
mons chamber fell and it appeared
that the handsome (Jothoc structure
was doomed.
The fire developed and spread with
such rapidity that the belier was, ex
pressed by officials that it. was of iu
ccudiary origin.

Berlin, Fob. 4. Germauv will not
disavow tho sinking of the Lunitania
with loss of American lives, and if the
American government does not. wish
to submit tho Issue to arbitration at
tho Hague, Germany is prepared to
consider breaking off of relations or
any other alejmalive which the United
States may have In view. This, in ef
fect, whb substance of Germany latest
note transmitted today to Washln
ton, and published in all the leading
German newspapers.
Washington, Feb. i. Son. Lans
ing today transmitted to President
Wilson in tho west, the latest and per
haps last word from the German gov
ernmont on the Lusitania controver
sy. Germany Is willing to apologize
for the act, and make restitution for
tho loss of American lives. She is fur
ther willing to submit her side of the
grievance to tho Hague- fur arbitra
tion, but she will sufi'er the breaking
of diplomatic relations, before she will
niako complete disavowal as the
United Slates requires.
Doep pessdmhm prevail?;, here at the
text of ,the i German communication.
The State department has instructed
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin to gath
er all the facts in connection with
Germany's apparent last word and for
ward a report on the attitude of the
German ;wc-rnmnr,t aad loading news

Washington, Feb. 3. The Appeal
case broadened out today, becoming a
complex and possibly fur reaching
(situation, threatening to affect some
of the fundamental questions of naval
warfare at issue between the United
States and Germany. For that rea
son it was not finally decided whet
her the ship should be returned to its
British owners under The Hague con
vention or held the fair prUa of the
Germans under tho Prussian-Ameri
can ireaty, although the indications
remained that the latter course ulti
mately would be fo'Jowed.
Officials are said to realize that thei
construction of the Prussian Ameri
can treaty in this case undoubtedly
will come up as a precedent at some
other time during the war, and even
might have a bearing on the case ol
the. American sailing ship William P.
Frye, sunk a year ago by the Germai:
commerce raider Prinz Eitel Fried
rich." The Frye case is on the eve o.'
settlement, practically on terms, for
which the United States contends.
American officials realize tho Ap-
pam presents the case-of a prize talt
en with great difilcu!tand risk of the
captors to the nearest accessible neu
tral port. They recognize that shouh'
the United States turn the vessel back
to tho' British owners that fact might
tie made an argument for sinking cap
tured merchantmen.
The situation was cleared of some
of Its complexities tcday, however, by
tho release of the twelve British sea
men whom the German commander
was inclined to hold as prisoners of
war because they had been gun point
ers on captured merchantmen.

WHAT IS CAUSE OF WAR
Free Lecture at High 3chool Hall
Next Week.
Arrangements were completed by
Bennington Council of the Knights
of Columbus last night for tho free
lecture by David Goldstein of Boston,
ou tiie Peace and War, which is to bo
held at High School Hall on Wednes
day Feb. 9 at 8 o'clock, p. in.
It is announced that Mr. Goldstein
will deal with his subject under three
headings, giving the causes of War
and the way to establish peace in our
domestic, industrial and government
al relations. Mr. Goldstein will make
plain tho Christian attitude on these
three phases ot his subject, while ho
exposes the false teachings of radi
cals.
What causes famiiy disruption?
What solution do Catholics offer for
divorce and its kindred modern evils?
What causes the industrial conflicts
of our time? llotv would Catholics
establish industrial per.ee?
What is the caute of War?
uoes tnc .uro;K?an war prove
Christianity' to be a failure?
What is needed to establish and tq
maintain an enduring peace of na
tions"
v hat has tho Church done- for In
ternational peace? What can she do
today?
Does obedience to the , Pope iu mat
ters cf faith and morals conflict with
the patriotic duty of Catholics to
their country?
Is there a higher form of patriotism
than that taught by the Catholic
Church? These are some of the ques
tions Mr. Goldstein will answer in
his address at the High School hall,
Wednesday evening Feb. 0. His
arguments aro said by his friends to
stand the tests . of right-reason, but
his enemies are not so complimentary-.
Mr. GolJstein is a couvert to the
Catholio faith, having been baptize:i
on May 21st, I!i05, wliich was two
years after he resigned from the,
Socialist movement. Mr. Goldsteins
fearless, fair and uncompromising at.
tilude in defense of Christian priiif
tuples against the assault "of ' oppon
ents has at length wt.n, for hirnf very
high standing In the- community'' in
which ho lives: And it has won for
him thousands of friends in the
United States and Canada. Mr. Gold
stein has the' ' dlstftlclion ' of having
been selected by Hia Eminence Wil
liam Cardinal O'Counell, Archbishop
oi' Boston, as layman to present the
Caiholic view o sociological prob
lems in 1907 and year after year since
that time. He is sent to tho annual
conventions of the American Federa
tion of Catholic Societies each year
to represent Boston.
The announcement that Mr. Gold
stein Is to speak in his home city is a
guarantee of a packed house. In re
porting the opening of the Common
Cause Forum last season the Boston
Journal says: ."Catholics and So
cialists by the thousands flocked to
Franklin Union Hall last night to
hear David Goldstein, a convert to the
Catholic faith, tell oi" his journey
from Socialism to the Church. Al
though the hall was filled 3.000 others
in front of tho building clamored for
admittance until long-cfter 9 o'clock,
when they were, finally convinced
that not another person could be ad
mitted." Mr. Goldstein's sound reasoning
and convincing logic is said frequent
ly to arouse the ire of his opponents
who invariably flock to hear and quiz
him, despite the attempts of the Na
tional officers of the Socialist party
to pet members to "ignore Goldstein
eud ask him no questions." The
press reports that "they come with
the hope of causing embarrassment
to the speaker, but in every instance
Mr. Goldstein has met the enemy,
disclosed their tactics, and complete
ly defeated them." In answer to a
California Socialist who made an at
tack upon Mr. Goldstein ho replied, in
part, "The charge of being a profes
sional turncoat has in fact no slen
derest thread to hold on to. My re
cord is simple. I have not changed
from one organization to another
nor back again. I have been as
sociated with one trade union during'
my life as a journeyman that is tho
Cigar Makers International Union of
America, of which I itm still a mom.
her in good standing and in which I
am proud to say I hold a 20 year old
rard. I have been associated with
hut one political movement I re
signed from the Socialist party
twelve years ago, after a futile at
tempt to induce it to repudiate its im
moral teachings. I have beeu con
nected with but one Church the Bo
man Catholic Church into which I
was privileged to enter ten years ego
last May the twenty-first.
"Moreover I -am not. a turncout
with regard to my religious convic
tions, I am but a belated follower of
cur dear Lord. Being . a Catholic
means not a denial of great Jewish
traditions, but rather a recognition of
their greatness by reason of their ful
fillment. The Catholic Church Is the
fulfillment of the law which was
placed into the hands of the children

higher law in tho Blessed Sacrament,

Permanent Relief For W
Chronic Constipation
Knowledge and Practice of Correct
Daily Habit the Great
Essential. ,
Constipation is a condition affecting
all classes of all people and can be
permanently relieved only by acquir
ing habits of regularity.
Tho most natural timo for the elim
inative process is in the morning
when both the muscular and nervous
systems aro relaxed by sleep and rest.
When relief does not come readily, it
is an excelrent plan to take a mild
laxative at bedtime. Cathartics and
purgatives, that by the violence of
quick uction shock and disturb the
system, should not be employed.
An effective laxative remedy that Is
very dependable, and which does not
gripe or otherwfse disturb the organs
involved, is fond in a combination of
simple laxative herbs known as Dr.
Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin that can be
bought at the Drug store for fifty
cents a bottle.
Mrs. C. C. Allen, 215 Foam St., New
