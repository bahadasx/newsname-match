which we commend to our readers. It
is reminiscent, many of the persons
spoken of are living and well known
in this community. The letter Is high
ly characteristic of the man.
Mr: Editor:
A Catlettaburg friend sent a copy of
the Big Sandy News to me the other
day and when I read the date lines
Louisa, Lawrence County, Kentucky,
and caught that top line, "Holds First
Prize of Kentucky Press Association ai
Best Eight Page Weekly In Kentucky,'
I was vividly reminded of the time
when there was not one newspaper on
Big Sandy from the Mouth to the
Breaks and the nearest thing to It was
my paper The Ashland Weekly Review
at Ashland. Brother Meek had The
Central Methodist at Catlettsburg. but
It waa religious, not secular, and there
fore not a newspaper In the general ac
ceptation of the term. Under the cir
cumstance It 1 hardly necessary for
me to say how much better the NEWS
i than the newspapers on . Sandy In
my time. Nor ia it necessary for me to
say what a prize beauty baa grown
from nothing, and that I quite agree
with the K. P. A. In its decision. Of
course, you never would have got the
prixe if I had kept The Review going
in Ashland, but how the dickens could
I when I had to live with my parent
to keep It going long enough for me to
get from under before It dropped on
me? However, that 1 all past now and
I rejoice to know that newspaper
flourish all over Eastern Kentucky and
their editors have so much money they
haul it around In motor car when the
roads will permit They do permit
some times, don't they? They didn't In
my day. The best piece of road in East
ern Kentucky waa between Catletts
burg and Ashland and I recall that Gus
Baurroann and I walked It one rainy
winter .night rather. than -go home by
the usual conveyance, and on another
occasion I horsebacked It from Ashland
one way only, and ate my meals off the
mantelpiece for ten days afterwards.
Such was life In N. E. K. In the early
day.
Now here' where I begin to reminisce
and every time I start doing it I can
feel the crows' feet clawing at my
eyes. Otherwise I am about a young
and frisky aa ever, ao I don't reminisce
except under great temptation. Tour
newspaper 1 the temptation. I started
mine at Aabland in February. 1877
seems like 1777 absolutely without
experience and not much more of a
bank account My chief asset was
Frank French and the two Davenport
boys who had been conducting Its pred
ecessor until the sheriff heartlesly stop
ped the Archlnedean lever that moves
the world. I should have known better,
but I had the bug and I would have
started a paper at the head-water of
Sandy If anybody had asked me to. As
nobody did, I started It at Ashland and
went up Sandy for additional assis
tance, Ashland and Catlettsburg not
being able at that time to carry the en
tire burden. Two pretty good towns,
two, aggregating about 8.000 people,
not counting the people In the county.
But nobody had been educated up to
local newspaper standards and It was
hard sledding. First off, I was told that
when Louisa came In with A. and C.
there wouldn't be any trouble about
making things hum. and I looked to
Louisa much aa I fancy Mose looked
to the Land of Canaan. It waa like
Egypt down In the other town. But
I could not tackle Louisa until Circuit
Court and that would come later, just
when I don't recall now, but In April,
I think. At last the happy day of de
parture came and on a bright Sunday
morning with Judge W. C. Ireland and
John F. Hager I started on the memor
able Journey, my - flrat Journalistic
Jaunt I remember I rode a trotting
horse and had my fears, but they were
groundless for we rode slowly and when
we reached Louisa that evening, I wa
feeling like gathering In any number
of eager subscribers for The Review
when Monday should arrive. The rid
after leaving Catlettsburg wa very In
teresting to me because I had always
heard of "Up Sandy" and waa anxious
to see It regardles of what It might
be to me aa financial aupport to my J
great moral engine at Ashland, terms I
It per year, Invariably In advance. We
topped at Mr, Will Moor' about half
! way for dinner, and while the dinner
may have been all that a Kentucky '
dinner should be, I only remember a
dark eyed, dark haired girl who if sbe
were a sample of Sandy loveliness wa '
plenty good enough for me. My. my.
and I am a bachelor yet . .
Arriving at Louisa as the evening sun
was sinking behind the western hill
it sink behind the western hills on
Sandy Just a it does everywhere else
if there are any hills we hitched up
in front of Tip Moore' tavern what
waa the name of It Louisa House?
and I wa Introduced to the Immortal
Tip a the only editor in captivity In
that section, not counting Orahn of
The Greenup Independent who wasn't
really an editor, . but an everlasting -hustler
and 1 went Into that tavern
feeling a though I bad at last struck
tha caravanaarv of mv dreams, because
there wa a bunch of town talker sit
ting around In front and I knew I
couldn't sit with them after supper and
listen to the music of their tongue by
the light of the stars. Maybe they were
not quite all that but so it seemed to -me,
and I wa glad to be an editor, if v
only to fall Into such pleasant place.
And all went Joyously till the time
came to go to bed. Then Hager and I
went up to our room and when I open- -ed
the bed assigned to me. I could And
but one sheet on 1L I counted the
cover once or twice to be sure I bad
not missed It but I hadn't and in sur
prise I asked John what about the
missing sheet In a tragic whisper.
hoarse with fear, John told me to say
nothing about it, because one sheet to
a bed was the Big Sandy custom and
it would start a feud or something if
I asked for two. Of course, my inten
tions were entirely peaceful and I went
to bed with one sheet I didn't know
Just how to handle it and John said It
waa to go next the mattress and the
blanket was to go next to me. What
happened after I got safely tucked in
never did know, because my 12 mile
ride demanded dreamless rest and It
got It all right I kept my counsel about
the sheet business, but Tip Moore was
such a winning sort that I was tempt
ed once or twice next day to say some
thing, but recalling Hager's admoni
tions I refrained. After a bully break
fast I went forth to do my first sub
scription soliciting. I don't know how
many people were in attendance at that
court hut If there were a million, I
went after each one, and when the
shades of night had fallen I didn't have
a name on my book, nor a dollar In
my pocket I hadn't brought with me.
Nary one. Still, I wasn't bitter against
the unappreciative Big Sandian be
cause I knew the light had not yet
shone upon them and probably I would
have to come among them several times
ere they could see their way clearly
and get the Illuminating radiance of

next morning I mounted my steed,
thanked tbe genial and generous Tip
for courtesies, thereby saving three
dollars In cash, put him on my free list
and rode away to the north, feeling nt
notwithstanding my failure. I did want
to stop where I had my dinner on Sun
day, but I did not dare and rode along
on a cracker and cheese I bought at a'
cross-roads store. My. spirits were
heartened some by meeting a man on
the road whom I approached on the
subject of intellectual uplift and he
gave me a quarter for a six weeks try
out I have forgotten that man's name
but I wouldn't if he had renewed his
subscription.
When I had once more reached my
base of operations I wrote up that first
trip to Louisa for The Review and did
It so different from any Big Sandy lit
erature that had ever circulated in that
neighborhood that I must have secur
ed at least half a dozen subscribers,
some of whom haven't paid yet But I
don't care. An editor can't make hi
first trip up Sandy more than once, and
why not enjoy It? I did, especially
what I had to say about that one-sheet-to-the-bed
condition and Tip Moore

In his house would have two sheets
apiece hereafter and when I came
again I could have three or more If
necessary. Which wa the gospel truth
for I went back there more than once
and the power of the press was ex
emplified in those hotel beds- if no
where else. And here I may add that
the good word went , farther and the
good work went on until every hotel I
visited along Sandy had two sheet to
the bed In which I slept even If other
were skimped. Today I fancy a hotel
keeper In those parts would laugh at
the very thought that the time ever
was when one sheet was the Invariable
custom. So much for the power of the
press!
