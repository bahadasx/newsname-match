"Git Hung. Nigger, Git Hung"
Irvin Cobb, the popular
short-story writer, has a
fund of anecdotes which he
delights to tell after a good
dinner. One of his favorite
stories is that of an incident
that occured in his native
state of Kentucky.
The story runs that a negro
man was sentenced to be
hanged for chicken stealing
or some equally heinous
crime. The hanging was to
take place in the court houe
square and the entire popula
tion of the town had turned
out to witness it.
In the crowd was the wife
of the condemned man, who
was arrayéd in all the fine
raiment possible to borrow
or beg. By her side was the
man she had already chosen
for a second husband, and
the parson awaited near by
to perform the marriage cere
mony when the wife had
been released from the bonds
of her first marriage.
With the perversity of the
male species, the man con
demned to be hung possib
ly understanding his wife's
desire to be on with the new
love sought to delay his ex
ecution by harranguing the
crowd. The sheriff did not
interfere knowing that the
speech of the victim would
be his last, but allowed him
to continue his talk.
The wife, impatient to get
to the wedding feast, bore
the delay as long as possible
and when she could stand it
no longer she approached the
scaffold and called to her
husband : ' 'Git hung, nigger,
git hung."
Likewise we say to the
editors of the Winslow Mail
and the Snowflake Herald:
"Make good, men, make
good." Start your recall
petitions and your impeach
ment proceedings; but be
careful lest you start some
thing you can not finish.
The people want to learn
whether or not you are bluff
ing. The grand jury last
week called some of Chap
man's bluffs and found him
fourflushing. We doubt that
he and Smith will make any
better showing in the recall
game.
Chapman Stricken
with Forgetfulness
Fortunate Investment
Judge D. J. Thomas, cash-
Redeemer Chapman of the I ier 01 tne Mercnantss siock-
Winslow Mail was a witness growers mnK or noiDrooK,
I 1 1 1
before the grand jury last 1S congratulating nimseiiup
Friday afternoon. The News
is not advised whether his
appearance before that body
was made at his own solicita
tion so that he might as
sist m bringing to speedy
justice the bunch of "arch
conspirators" that "infests
the courthouse" - or whether
some other agency caused
his appearance.
Neither are we advised as
to the nature of the disclo
sures made by Chapman in
his testimony before the
grand jury, but we imagine
that he was suddenly strick
en with forgetfulness when
questioned about various al
leged fraudulent transact
ions about which he had pre
viously said so much.
Anyhow we have not no
ticed any exodus of the
"court house gang", and we
naturally assume that Chap
man's testimony before the
grand jury carried no more
weight than the harrangues
he publishes weekly in his
organ of discord which is
none at all.
Avoiding Brain-Fag
It appears that the Wins
low Mail and the Snowflake
Herald have formed a syndi
cate for the purpose of dis
seminating tirades against
various office holders in
Navajo county. By this met
hod the effusion of vitupera
tion published one week in
the Mail is reprinted next
week in the Herald, and vice
versa. The arrangement is
a good one, for in this man
ner the danger of brain-fag
is avoided, and the men who
write the stuff for both
papers are not even put to
the necessity of making car
bon copies of it.
Sale of First Store Confirmed
The sale of the B. First
general merchandise store in
Holbrook was confirmed by
Judge Sapp in superior court
Thursday morning. The sale
had been made several
weeks ago by the adminis
trators of the estate, the
purchasers being R. E. Put
ney of Albuquerque and W.
J. Hookway of Holbrook.
One of the administrators, S.
A. Simon, obiected to the
sale being confirmed, and
employed Attorney R. E.
Morrison of Prescott to con
test the matter. Thursday
morning Mr. Morrison stated
that no contest would be
made to prevent the sale
proceeding, his clients, S. A.
Simon and Mrs. Shapiro,
being satisfied to allow it to
stand.
S. A. Simon offered his re
signation as administrator,
and it was accepted by Judge
Sapp. L. C. Henning, the
other administrator, will
now act alone and will pro
ceed with a partial distribu
tion of the money belonging
to the estate, in accordance
with an order made by the
court.
The purchasers of the
n i mi .
r irst store win at once in
corporate a company for con
ducting the business. W. J.
Hookway, station agent for
the Santa Fe in Holbrook,
will resign his position with
the railroad company and
will assume the management
of the store under its new
ownership. Mr. Hookway,
during the years he has been
agent for the Santa Fe here,
has gained an enviable re
putation for integrity and
business acumen, and in his
new business venture he will
no doubt be successful.
on his foresierht in making
some real estate investments
in Gallup a few years ago.
For a time after purchasing
a track of land adjoining the
town, Judge Thomas was
somewhat doubtful about its
rapid rise in value. How
ever, a few months ago the
Santa Fe Railroad company
started in to make extensive
improvements in the com
pany's facilities there, and
the subdivision put on by
Judge Thomas and his asso
ciates is right in the line of
the city's growth. The many
friends of Judge Thomas in
Holbrook will rejoice at his
good fortune in guessing
right in this instance.

Refused Flattering Offer
W. E. Chamberlain, man
ager of the L. B. Putney Co.
in Holbrook, refused a very
flattering offer this week
from the First National
Bank of Albuquerque to pur
chase the Whitney Whole
sale Hardware business in
that city. The bank people 0f
now own this company, of
which Mr. Chamberlain was
manager for a number of
years, and they made him
an offer to sell to him on
very liberal terms. The
offer was made by Col. D.
K. B. Sellers, represen
ting the bank, who was
in Holbrook last Friday
night. Mr. Chamberlain took
the offer under advise
ment until vesterdav,
when he wired his declina
tion to 'accept. He was aid
ed in making his decision by
faith in the future growth
of Holbrook, believing
that eventually his present
position will grow into a bet
ter thing than that offered
by the Albuquerque people.
Since coming to Holbrook
less than a year ago Mr.
Chamberlain has not only
built up a good business for
the Putney 'Company, but
he has established himself
firmly in the esteem of all
who have met him socially
and in a business wav. That
his decision is to remain in
Holbrook is a matter of con
gratulation to these friends.
nobody thought it possible
to hold more than one ex
position at a time; California
had two, at San Francisco
and San Diego. Hitherto
the time limit was late spring
summer and early fall; the
San Francisco big show ran
about ten months and San
Diego a full twelve months.
Now the latter city boldly
decides to keep going for
another year, making a two
years' continuous perfor
mance. Ample funds have
been subscribed to insure
isuccess.
The San Diegans plan
Some marked improvements
for 1916. Many important
foreign exhibits will be mov
ed down from San Francisco,
including the Canadian,
French, Italian, Dutch, Rus
sian, Spanish, Swiss, German
and Austrian. It is probable
that India, Persia and Tur
kev will be added. Exhibits
the California counties
have been secured, and a
number of "Zone attrac
tions. The Santa Fe's Paint
ed Desert Indian village will
also remain.
A large attendance is ex
pected from the East, parti
cularly during the summer
season, when the perfect cli
mate of San Diego is at its
best. Patriotic Americans
who were unable to visit the
Far West during 1915 should
not fail to include the San
Diego Exposition in their
vacation itinerary for 1916.
Handicap Ski Record
Mr. Harold Green estab
lished a record for handicap
skiing, this morning when he
came in from his ranch in
forty five minutes in spite of
the driving storm, soft dry
snow, and huge fresh drifts.
The distance is about two
and a half miles. Williams
News.
Something Good
Those who hate nasty medicine
should try Chamberlain's Tablets
for constipation. They are plea
sant to take and their effect is so
agreeable and so natural that you
will not realize that it has been
produced by a medicine. Obtain
able everywhere.
Narrowly Escapes Death
Jose Ortega, a young man
who resides with his mother
on a ranch a few miles west
of town, was nearly electro
cuted yesterday at 12:30
o'clock when his horse stepp
ed on a live wire that had
fallen to the ground near the
Cotton store. The horse was
instantly killed by the elec
tricity and urtega was
thrown to the ground when
the ainmal was killed. The
boy was thrown clear of the
wire but belieyes he received
a shock through the horse
Ortega is said to have been
slightly injured by the fall
and on his neck there is the
evidende of a burn. The boy
was riding to town from his
home when the accident oc
cured. Gallup Herald.
Severe Cold Quickly Cured.
"On December first I had a
very severe cold or attack of the
grip as it may be, and was near
ly down sick in bed," writes O.
J. Metcalf, Weatherby. Mo. "I
bought two bottles of Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy and it was
only a few days until I was com
pletely restored to health. I
firmly believe that Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy is one of the very
best medicines and will know
what to do when I have another
cold." Obtainable everywhere.
brought $8.50. Receipts
were 8000 head, and packer
buyers were out early for cat
tle to start killing gangs with
there having- been a close
cleanup last week, as re
ceipts were light after Tues
day. Buyers were in a will
ing, not to say anxious, mood
and the predicted rise in cat
tle values in the next thirty
or sixty days, estimated at
around a dollar per cwt. in
some quarters, appear more
logical than it did last week.
Receipts were 8000 head here
considerably less than on re
cent Mondays. Good to
choice beef steers sell at $7.-
75 to $8.50, medium to com
mon kinds $6.50 to $7.50,
western fed steers $7.00 to
$8.25, cows $5.50 to. $6.50,
heifers $6.75 to $8.50, veals
$8.00 to $10.50.
tine receipts of cattle con
tinue very light, some 963 lb.
steers here today from Wag
oner at $6.90. In stockers
and feeders there has been
no change in prices since a
week ago. A larger percent
age of the supply runs to
beef cattle at this season,
and the stockers and feeders
find ready sale, stock steers
largely at $6.25 to $7.50,
feeders $6.75 to $7.50, a few
cattle up to $7.85, breeding
cows and heifers $5.25 to
$6.75.
Sheep and lambs broke 25
to 35 cents last week, and the
market is weak to 15 lower
today, receipts 12000 head.
Packers claim there is a bad
outlet for dressed mutton,
which is the onlv reason for
lower prices, as supplies at
the markets continue mode
rate. The bes lambs here
sold at $10.25 to $10.35, some
yearlings brought $9. 10,
wethers $7.75, ewes $7.10.
Feeding lambs sold up to $9.-
75 and $9.85 last week, and
some brought $9.70 today
Prospects point to a recovery
in the fat sheep and lamb
market, but feeding: lambs
may sell lower.

The Best Recommendation
The strongest recommendation
anv article mav receive is a
favorable word from the user.
It is the recommendations of
those who have used it that
makes Chamberlain's Cough Re
medy so popular. Mrs. Amanda
Gierhart, Wajftiesfield, Ohio,
writes, "Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy has been used in my
family off and on for twenty
years and it has never, failed to
cure a cough or cold." Obtain
able everywhere.
For a Billious Attack
When you have a severe head
ache, accompanied by a coated
tongue, loathing of food, constí
pate ion, torpid liver, vomiting of
partly digested food and then
bile, you may know that you
have a severe billious attack.
While you may be quite sick
there is much consolation in
knowing that relief may be had
by taking three of Chamberlain's
Tablets. They are prompt and
effectual. Obtainable every
where.
