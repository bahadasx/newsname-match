The miners' demands were formu
lated last Septeml er at Wilkesbarre,
Pa., and were ratified last week by
the I'nlted Mine Workers' convention
at Indianapolis.
Would Ik' l'alil by Public.
In a reply to their employes, signed
by the heads of nineteen anthracite
companies and upproved at their meet
ing today, it Is stated that to grant the
wage scale would mean an advance to
tin- consumer of 60 cents u ton for do
mestic sizes of untliracite. The opera
tors declare that the anthracite indus
try is being conducted "on as low a
margin of profit as is possible, if the
operators are to continue to serve the
public."
Answering the miners' contention
that the cost of food in 12 j ears in
creased 40 per cent and wages .1 1-2
per cent, the operators present fJguns
purporting to show "an Increase of
only 16 per cent in the miners' total
cost of living as compared with an in
crease of over 36 per cent In his earning-
capacity."
laborers Arc rroscrliig-.
. "The increase in the opportunity
for earnings as compared with the in
crease in the cost of living." says the
operators' statement, "combine to
make the increased prosperity of tlte
anthracite miner far in advance of
Other classes of labor."
The demand for recognition of the
United Mine Workers, is declared un
reasonable as It would ".subject the
anthracite region to the politics of
an organization absolutely controlled
from the outside." The operators
point out that a majority ,,f the mem
bers of the I'nlted Mine Workers arc
employed in tho bituminous coal
fields. They hold the "rights of or
ganized labor are fully protected by
tlie open shop principles established
by the commission."
Defend Present System.
The miners' contention that the
present system growing out of the
"contract provision between miners
and operators Is anticipated" is char
acterized as a, "misleading statement."
The arrangement, the operators say.
"was a part of the award of the
anthracite commission which 'pro
vided for a board of conciliation
through the operation of which
strikes and lockouts should become
unnecessary."
The work of the board has "stood
til," lest of thirteen years and It is
believed that any further departure
Irom the rules laid down by the com
mission will be. a decided step back
ward and an encouragement to labor
troubles in the anthracite field," the
operators declare.
Jn this connection grievance com
mittees provided in the agreement of
1S12 between the operators and min
ers should be abolished, the operators
say.
The proposed two-year agreement
is described as "a business arrange
ment that is shown by actual exper
ience in the bituminous field to
threaten a bl-yearly disturbance of
the peace, and prosperity of the min
ers, operators and general public.
Tlie operators quote government
statistics to show that the tim,. lost
by strikes and suspensions in tho bi
tuminous field between 1H00 and 1912
was equivalent to a loss earning ca
pacity "approaching tho labor cost of
digging onother Panama canal."
