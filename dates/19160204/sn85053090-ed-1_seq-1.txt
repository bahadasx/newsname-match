VOLUME VIII.
EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1916.
NUMBER 5
TOM STOUT TO QUIT
Will Not be a Candidate I"oï
Re-electipn This Year.
The news wàs'spread over the
slate last week that at the ex
piation of his present term Con
gressman Tom Stout will end his
political career at Washington
and return to the editorial desk
of the Lewiston Democrat, his
o n paper. Personally Mr. Tom
S I out is well liked and he has re
presented Iii« state during the
past two terms in such a manner
as is a credit to Montana and the
democratic party. While the
mà
Congressman Torn Stout
party and his many friends are
sorry to learn that he no longer
desires political recognition as
Congressman they are glad to
welcome him back to the Treas
ure state, knowing that as editor
of one of our leading newspapers
he will accomplish great good in
aiding in the work of up-buiiding
the state and the democratic
party.
Leap Year Social.
The Medicine Rock Literary
Society announce their next pro
.gram to be held at the school
house on February 12th at 7:30
p. m. The next number will be

where the bovs bring tne baskets
and the sky-high bidding is done;
by the young ladies. Here's
chance for the boys to let the
baking powder biscuits take the
lead. A Valentine box has been
prepared for the young folks.
The social supplies have arrived

iff's office. Joe has been absmt
for the past four years, his de
p i r t u re all of a sudden causing
much anxiety among several of
the residents in this section. Just
what action is to be taken in his
case has not been ascertained as
we understand that the complain
ing witness is willing to make a
settlement for his alleged loss.
Mail Blockade.
Owing to the condition of th
weather the daily mail stage fai
ed to make the trip between hgre
and Baker, both Saturday and
Monday. Saturday's mail arrived
late Sunday evening but Conduc
tor Hamilton after making a
start Monday morning turned
back to wait until some change
was noted A blizzard resembling
one of those "talkabouts" bro!*e
loose upon us Sunday evening
and for many hours it was im
possible to see ourselves taste or
hear ourselves think. Some real
winter weather out here we as
sure you.
The Same Old Grin
In dden days we used to grin
when some subscriber war dered
in and, kinda careless like, wouid
say, "I brun g a barrel o' spuds
t'dav. They're worth a dollar,
purty near, so send the paperi
'nother year. And mother want- j
! t ,, ^ , ... . i
ed me to say that she liked that I
piece the other day—the one
wrote about our Bill teach' n g
school up on the hill. Th-.t tickled
tno'hc< > ^ke the ù.v,Oc, ài.°"so sir.?
sends this .here fat goose." We
never used to need a cent to pay
the-grocer or the rent Subscrip
tions out in trade we took. We j
got a'ong*-by hook or crook, but
time? have changed and nowa- j
days we must adop.t newfangled j
ways. The farmers are all busi- j
ness men. They sell their stuff'j
foj\,good hard cash., themortgag- :
es have all gone to smash ; a trac
tor has displaced ,the-mules; the
cbil&'ren' go ta brick high schools;
thev keep their money in the
banks, their gasoline in iron
tanks. They don't di op in to see
us now—we miss their visits, 1
allow. But still, they write

THE COLD JANUARY
Of 1916 Puts All '86 Records
On The Blink.
( "The worst I have seen since I
have been in Ekalaka" is the
w a y Local Weather Observer
Wm. Freese expressed himself
today in speaking of the extreme
co |d spell that we have been hav
ing since the first of the year,
i„ looking over the table below
you w ju observe that during this
time we have withstood 28 days
wit h the thermometer down be
] ow zer0( 0]1 i y 2 days in the past
24 being above the zero mark,
And still the weather continues
to hold on, just for how long we
dare not predict, but certainly
I hope for the best within a few
days. It would be hard toascer
tain the amount of snow now ly
ing on the ground, some places
. being nearly bare while in others
seemingly bottomless drifts are
found. Loss of stock has been
very slight so far, the past year
affording everyone the opportun
ity of putting up plenty of winter
feed and to stiil leave good pas
ture. Here's the official weather
score since the birth of 1910:
