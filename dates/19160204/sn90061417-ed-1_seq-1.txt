truth
Accepts the Call.
It Is certainly gratifying to Tiik
Stt.NTiNia, and will doubtless be
equally so on the part of the people of
llolt county, that Judge A. D. liurnes
has consented to become a candidate
for renomlnallon at the coming Aug
ust primaries, for Clrult Judge of this
Judicial circuit.
Judge liurnes lias been endorsed and
called upon tostand for renomlnallon,
by the entire bar of his circuit, and
under mucIi Haltering circumstances
we cannot well see how he could do
otherwise. We believe had thu people
ueen given a like opportunity, their
endorsement of his service on thu
bench would have been as hearty and
sincere as that of tho bar.
Judge liurnes, since coming to thu
llolt circuit court bench, lias proven
himself an honest, conscientious, and
fearless Judge, and we believe all our
people, regardless of political ailllllla
Hons, are fully salhlled with his ser
vices, and will be glad to know that
he will be a candidate for renamlna
Hon, which we hope and believe will
be unanimous,
