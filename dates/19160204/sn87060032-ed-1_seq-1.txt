As was announced the gavels
j that ere procured by the Sun
day Schools of the city through
the suggestion and efforts of Dr.
C. A. Bromley, pastor of the
First M. E. Church, were pre
sented Saturday morning at the
Courthouse at motion hour.
Lieutenant Governor Black,
having come home on Friday,
i . . . . . . .
i those in charge thought it more
fitting that he should bepiesent-
od the gavel here than at Frank-
I fort. So at 9:15 o'clock, Rev. J.
W. Ligon pastor of the First
Christian Church presented to
Judge Sampson the gavel in the
following words
Judge Sampson. Ladies and
Gentlemen:
It is a common fault of man-
Kmu l" postpone saying
any
thing good about our friends un
til after they are dead. Homer,
the blind poet of antiquity, re
cited his bnllnds from town 1 1
toW11 aml begged his bread
lun ii .11 in utrgKcit '" u'cuu iiuiu
door to door. He lived a mendi
cant and died in obscurity and
neglect: but he left behind him
an imperishable monument in
tho excellent literary work he
had produced. Long after his
death hio n: me became famous.
Men began to appreciate his
work. Then seven cities con
tended for the honor of being
his birth place.
"Seven Greek cities vied
fpr Homer "dead, through
which the living Homer beg-
ped his bread."
Sir (addressing Judge Samp
son) from the day that you as
sumed the duties of the high and
honorable position which you fill,
till now, your friends and neigh
bors have watched your course
as an official; and so well pleased
have they been that they are not
willing to wait longer before ex
pressing their appreciation of
you. They have been highly
gratified at your firm stand for
law and order, for temperance

of the purest ivory, banded with

this gift, and it is preted,

And when the time comes f
you to lay down the duties anjj

Sunday-schools of Barbourville,
I now have the honor to present
to you. (Here Brother Ligon
placed in Judge Sampson's hand
the gavel; Judge Sampson rising
to his feet and bowing thankful
ly). Judge Sampson in response
spoke as follows:
Br.o. Ligon. Ladies and Gentle
men :-
This is indeed a beautiful gav
el; but what Brother Ligon has
said, speaking for the Sunday
schools and for my neighbors
and friends, looks better and
sounds better to me than any
gavel, or ring of any gavel that
could possibly be presented

surprise imd I do not know how

G. A. R. on Preparedness
Harbourville, Kentucky
January 24. 1910.
We, the comrades of the John
G. Eve Post, No. 221. G. A. R.
do agree that
Whereas, there is so much agi
tation about the preparedness
program of the present adminis
tration in the event of war, we.
the comrades of the said Post do
submit to the G. A. R. comrades
of the United States of America
for their consideration 'as to the
requisite number of the standing
army in time of peace the prop
osition that our standing army
should at no time exceed the
number of two hundred thousand.
We do not propose to dictate to
our old comrades as to any policy
they wish to pursue or express
but merely to invite their atten
tion to the important question
referred to.andjwe know thattwe
all have a deep interest in our
1 country's wellfare and feel like
they will agree with us in regard
to same. Surely they have not
' fonrotten the strucrele from ISf.l
, t0 ig65, when their attention U
draWn to the articles now ap-
! pearjnB jn the pi ess and to the
.i, i n nrenaration and now
being ottered before tho Con
gress of the United States pro
views, xnereiore, we invite tne
opinion of the Grand Army of
the. United States in regard to
same, not only from comrades
but from Posts.
We put ourselves on record as
being in favor of sufficient forces
in our standing army to guard
our forts and our public jKirts.
We believe the safety of our
country depends more on tho
patriotism of the common people
than in a large standing army.
We believe that the volunteer
soldiers are a safer means of de
fense in time of war;
Whereas, we view with dis
favor and distrust the proposi
tion to raise a large standinp
army, as being n menace to the
peace and to the patriotism of
our country. We do not desire
that our children and future gen;
erations should reap the fate oi

and great people, who were
brought to wreck and ruin
through the military power of
the nation.
Wherefore, we request our
representatives in Congress and
in the United States Senate to
not pass any oui that would en
danger the peoples' liberties.
However, we desire to put our
selves on record as being in

cient to meet

we ao not see why our navy
should not be the strongest and

Uncle Bill Allen Ousted
Uncle Bill Allen, the Repre

ousted from his peat in the Leg
islature, Thursday morning, by
Jie Democrat who was contest
ing his seat. It seems that Un
cle Bill was the nominee of the.
Republican party, and that he
failed to send his nominating
papers to the Secretary of State
so that his name might be print
