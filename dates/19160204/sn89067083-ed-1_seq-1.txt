Prevention of Small Pox.
Most of the triumphs in the
prevention of disease have oome
about as the direct result of the
discoveries of Faeleur and the
establishment of what ia known
as the germ theory of disease.
However, before the time of
Pasteur one most notable advance
was made; namely,. the discovery
of vacoination by Dr. Edward
Jenner, 1708. ' Previous to that
time about one person in every
ten ,died of smallpox. In Eng
land, one person in every three
showed pock marke on the fare
wnen it waa carried to a new
oountry the death rate was some
thing frightfut, as for example,
in Mexioo, where 3,500,000 of the
natives died of the disease after
its introduction by the Spanish
For many years in England it
had been observed that cows euf
fer from an eruption boated about
the udder and, flanks, and that
milkers were likely to become in
fected with the material from this
eruption. Doctor Jenner observ
ed that those who had suffered
from this infeolion did not con
traot smallpox, which almost
everybody had at that time. He
began to experiment by infecting
people and then, watching their
ed hisbbeervation absolutely that
an attaok of this disease which is
known ' a s vaooinia protected
against a subsequent attaok of
smallpox. The germ or virus
had become attenuated or weak
ened in its virulence. It is known
that vaccinia as seen in the oow
is a modified form of smallpox.
If we transfer some of the matter
from' the smallpox postules on a
human being to a oalf, we do not
produce smallpox but only the
mild disease known as vaccinia.
When we again trtinsfer this mat
ter from the oalf to the human
being, it dois not regain its viru-
lenoe, but produces the mild form
of the disease, though it has the
power of protecting again? t the
severe disease, smallpox, beoauee
protective substances are formed
by the cells of the bdy in re
sponse to the attaok of the weak
ened germ, just as they are In
true smallpox, and without dan
ger. ; ' - .' 1
During the Eighteenth Cen
tury, there were 70,000 deaths a
year from Esallpox in Germany.
From 1848 to 1870, twenty-five
persons out of every 100,000 died
of the disease in that oountry. In
1871 and 1372, owing to the Fran-
00- Prussian War, the disease be
oame prevalent, causing ' the
death of 213 and 202 persons re
spectfully in every 100,000. In
1874, vaccination was made com
pulsory, and Immediately a mar
ked falling off in the disease was
noticed, , ;From 1874 to 1888, 1.57
died in every 100,000, and in the
year 1910, .there were" 'only 33
deaths from smallpox in the en
tire, empire of Germany with a
population of over 60,000,000, and
15 of these were foreigners. If
the old rate had kept up, 160,000
persons a year would have lest
their live from this disease.
Surely no stronger proof of the
vain of mnHn5 Mlij ,
given. " 1
. Ilowlorj doea this protection
last? In r;-a persons it iats
tot life, t"t the average person
should be vaccinated whenever
exposed. If they are still pro
tected by C.3 former vaccination,
It does not nsult in any pain or
inonnveni z&. At best this is
on'y temr- . ry and is amply paid
fur by U. i frotcctiun from the
1- 'jubaome and tles-Jly dist.-i
known as -'.', x. In ad-Jition
: ti proven . j; r-.a d;3"ase, vacci-
ni'.ijii 1. r.v-.rej it nauch
milder and it is not nearly so Be
vere in those who have been vac
cinated, even when it doea not
protect entirely.' . For example:
During the bad ' years in Ger
many, 1871-72, it was found '.hat
oi ttiose persons who had been
vaccinated more than onoe, only
5 out of every 100 of those who
contracted the disease died. Of
those who had been vaccinated
only once, 14 out of every 100
died, while among those who had
not been' vvsoinated at all, the
death rate reached 45 in every
100.
Tested Seed Corn Will Save
, Missouri Millions.
Carefully conduoted oorn-ger
minatlon tests in Missouri this
year may, if properly followed
up by an elimination, of those
ears whioh. are low in vitality,
make an inorease of $11,273,491
for the 1916 oorn orop.
This amount is an estimate of
the average annual loss caused
by the use of untested eeed oorn
n the state during the last, eight
years, aooording to J. C. Haokle
man nf the College of Agrioulture
of the University of Missouri at
Columbia. ' The use of tested
seed corn may make the differ
enoe between an 85 per cent stand
and a perfect one, or . between 25
and 28 bushels an acre at gath
ering time. '
Last year's wet season, slow
maturity and late gathering of
the orop resulted in cribbing
much corn before it was ripe
enough to make good seed. The
oorn contained bo much water
that it was almost aura to heat
and mold even if it were mature
enough to gather. The Missouri
ariner who selected seed oare
fully in the field and stored It
properly can make a big return
now by his increased orop or by
selling the seed to his neighbors
who did not take precautions last
fall.
f The task of testing seed oorn
for Missouri's 7,282,617 acres is
not so great When we remember
that the work is divided among
more than a quarter of a million
farmers, : This means that to
plant the average man's 26.6
acres only four or five bushels of
tested seed are needed. As it
takes about two hours to test a
bushel, of seed oorn, tea hour'
work by the average Missouri
farmer would usually result in a
difference of $40 in his income,
or about $150 an acre net gain
for all the eorn he plants.
The sand box or sawdust ger-
minator consists of a box about
four inches deep an thirty in
ches square, with about two in
ches of sand or sawdust in the
bottom to hold the moisture or to
keep water from standing around
the oorn. A piece of old sheet
ing or other clcth that will ab
sorb moisture, but will not allow
it to stand on the surfaoe, should
be stretched over the surface and
marked off into two-inch squares.
Put six kernels from various
parts of the middle of each ear
