The Ice King Makes
Havoc With Trees and Wires
Old King Ice held a most depressing
iind practically complete siege in this
community, the same as in many
other communities, last Friday, run.
ning well into the night before his
strangle-hold was finally released by
Moderating Temperature..
Quite early in the morning the
rain that was falling commenced to
stick and freeze when it struck any
thing abov ground, though ice failed
to form on the ground. As the day
advanced, the temperature continued
to fail, and the work of coating ev
erything with ice continued with in
creasing rapidity.
Along in the afternoon the weight
of the ice had become so great that
aiany limbs, and some trees, were un.
able to hold up under their chilly bur
den, and went down. It seemed al
itoiit as if a. battle was in progress,
to hear the limbs and trees breaking
with loud report, and crashing to the
ground.
As the temperature went lower, the
roar of battle constantly became more
intense, and by nightfall practically
all the telephone and electric wires
had been utilized in the "battle,"
forming a wire entanglement some
what similar to those that have be
come so popular in the European war
zone. And they did form an entang
lement worthy of consideration, be
ing wound among trees and huge
iimbs that had assisted in bringing
ihem down. ,
It was nearing midnight before the
iiege was finally raised through the
intervention of Moderating Tempera
ture, and the uproar of explosions
ceased. To those listening in the
trenches and they were many it
seemed that there would be but few
trees standing. Payight, however,
disclosed the fact that the loss had
been very greatly overestimated, as
Acre were comparatively few trees
down, though most yards were thick
ly littered with limbs.
This indicated that much of the

"bombardment" of the night had been
caused by the breaking of the ice
incasements of the trees. The side
walks were also littered with debris,
and forces of men were kept busy all
of Saturday clearing away the work
of destruction. At daylight Saturday
a scene was presented the like of
which was perhaps never before seen
in this community. While the trees
were now stripped clean of the enemy
that had caused the damage, great
piles of the crystal casement that had
lately adorned the trees now lay in
broken and dismantled piles where it
had fallen from the trees as the tem
perature arose.
The oldest inhabitant has failed as
yet to appear to state that in such
and such a year "more ice congealed
on the trees, wires, etc., to a much
greater extent than it did last Friday."
In fact, all The Times has interviewed
seem free to admit they never before
saw the like of it. The telephone
lines were quickly repaired, but the
damage to the electric light wires
was far more extensive, and linemen
are still busy putting them in correct
position.
This city has been dark for several
nights, which fact will doubtless
cause all to appreciate more fully a
"lighted town," and not grumble so
much, even if the lights sometimes
do seem too far apart. There was al
so a pronounced breath of relief went
up from this community when the Ice
King broke camp. At certain seasons
of the year he is bribed liberally to
remain in our midst but not now.
Practically the same conditions ex
isted in every other community as
prevailed here during the storm period.
In renewing his subscription to The
Times, P. E. White, one of the leading
citizens of Knob Lick, writes: "I am
glad to see The Times getting better.
It looked to me like it was bad sick,
but looks now like it will get a start
again."
GLARING DISCREPANCIES IN -
REAL ESTATE ASSESSMENTS!
The problem of equitable assess
ment for the purposes of taxation is
one with which our legislative bodies
have long wrestled, and yet no satis
factory solution has been reached.
The condition is still one wherein the
smaller property holders oftener than
otherwise are made to pay relatively
a larger proportion of the taxes. Not
only is it true that the wealthy and
large investor may evade taxation on
much of his personal property in the
shape of bonds, mortgages, notes,
stocks, etc., but his large estate and
regal residence, with its extensive
park, racing grounds and hunting
preserves, which compare favorably in
munificence with the castles and man
ors of the old world, are rarely
rated by the assessor in ratio
with smaller properties. The aver
age munificence of such an estate is
so imposing that it staggers the as
sessor's judgment when he come to
place a valuation on it, and because
of its regal largeness he is disposed
to be too moderate in fixing a taxing
value lest he impose too enormous a
a tax on the owner.
Not so, however, when he comes to
assess a more .modest property; even
if he should overvalue it somewhat the
amount of taxes that would accrue
from such valuation is so small in pro
portion to the amount the owner of
the vaster estate must pay, that the
assessor's judgment is unwittingly
perhaps biased in favor of the latter;
and the valuation fixed by the asses
sor is seldom disturbed by boards of
equalization.
We have been led into these reflec
tions by what has long been recog
nized as inequitable in the assessment
of the lead companies' property in St.
Francois county, and which has fre
quently been discussed in a cursory
manner in the Times and other local
papers. In this county, and it is
doubtless true of every county in the
State, the custom has been to assess
MISSOURI-COLORADO ROMANCE
Albert J. Zwart of Kansas City,
formerly of this pla:e, and Mrs.
Maude W. Bunting of Grand Junctir n,
Colorado, are to b nurrhtd in about
three weeks the exact date is not
given at the Cathedral in Denver,
Colorado. There is quite a little ro
mance associated with this marriage,
which may prove interesting to Mr.
Zwart's host of friends here and to
the former friends of Mrs. Bunting at
Ironton. What follows is from the
Denver Post:
"A romance which started at least
thirty years ago back in the lazy lit
tle town of Ironton, Mo., will reach a
pretty climax within the next three.
weeks when Mrs. Maude W. Bunting,
owner of the Grand Junction Sentinel
and widow of L N. Bunting, for twen
ty years editor of that paper, becomes
the bride of Albert J. Zwart cf Kan
sas City and Grand Junction, presi
dent of the Redlands Irrigating and
Power Company, and representative
of the Henry L. Doherty interests of
the Grand Valley.
"Mrs. Bunting and Albert Zwart
were schoolday sweethearts, back in
the days of beribboned "pigtails" and
knee breeches, and young Zwart made
certain vows and declarations rela
tive to matrimony. But time sped on
and it looked as though the Zwart
vows were mere boyish -boasts. He
married another girl and she mar-
! ried another man, a newspaper man
who was destined to become a power in
Western Colorado. The old sweet
hearts were still friends and often
met in their homes.
"Five years ago Mr. Bunting died.
Two years later Mrs. Zwart (who was
Miss Clara Parkhurst of Farmington)
succumbed to prolonged illness. And
next month (February) the widow
and widower will be married."
After their marriage Mr. and Mrs.
Zwart will visit friends in Farming
ton for a few days in March, and
spend several months in an extended
tour of the South and East. They
will then make their home at Kansas
City, and will also maintain a resi
dence at Grand Junction, Colorado,
where they will spend several months
of each year.
real estate at about one-third or a
little more of is estimated value. If
this rule were applied to our lead
companies there would be a consider
able increase in the revenue of the
county. These companies have been,
as long as we can remember, assess
ed -at a much less rate than farm and
other real property.
Take the St, Joseph Lead Company,
it being the oldest, for example. Ac
cording to its own statement or bal
ance sheet for the calendar year end
ing December 31, 1914, the value of
its land holdings alone in this coun
ty is $6,732,514.16. And yet this com
pany is assessed on all its lands to
gether with its mills, equipment
houses and other taxable property,
only $1,452,830. This is but a little
more than one-sixth the value that
the company places on its lands, while
every farm and household in the coun
ty is assessed at one-third or more
Of its estimated value double that of
the lead company's lands with all its
other taxable property thrown in.
Isn't that out of all proportion? Is
it just to other taxpayers ?
But to go a little furher: Besides
the company's $6,732,542.13 of valu
able lead land, it has according to its
own statement and valuation, sepa
rate and apart from its lands, $4,
064,.r0!.33 in buildings and equipment,
a total of assessable property of $10,
797,051.49. If this were all assessed
in proportion to the assessments of
farm lands, the company's assessment
would be about $3,599,027, whereas it
is only $1,452,880, or about one-eighth
the valuation placed on it by the com
pany itself, while the farmer or house
holder pays taxes on one-third of the
estimated value of his property. Here
the Inequality is flagrantly transpar
ent. The assessments for taxation pur
poses on the property of the Doe Run
and other lead companies are about
in proportion to that of the St. Joseph
Lead Company. We may take occa
sion to refer to these and other mat
ters along this line in future articles.
WOULD VOTE BONDS
FOR COUNTY ROADS
Shelt T. Horn, one of Marion town
ship's thrifty, energetic and successful
farmers, was in town Tuesday and
called on The Times. We are glad to
make the acquaintance of Mr. Horn
and listened with interest to his good
mads talk. Since the rains and the
floods of the past week have knocked
the bottom out of all dirt roads, the
comfort of travel on good roads im
presses itself upon one more urgent
ly than when the roads are dry, even
if they be a little rough.
Mr. Horn wants to inaugurate a
movement in favor of bonding the
county to raise money for the purpose
of constructing an adequate system
of macadam road; throughout the
county that will be good all the year
round. He thinks it would be of the
greatest material advantage to farm
ers and everybody else to have such
a system of roads; that while we have
some good macadam roads, and the
policy of the County Court is to keep
on constructing them to the extent
that the road taxes will allow each
year, he thinks it would be a saving
in the long run if we were to bond the
county and do the work by wholesale
instead of by piece meal a saving in
the first cost of the roads and a sav
ing right along to every one who has
hauling o do or who wants to travel
anywhere in the county, in wear and
tear of vehicles and team, in getting
farm products to shipping points or
to the local markets, and in worry and
vexatious delays.
There is much that may be said for
Mr. Horn's theory, and The Times
opens its columns for any and all who
would like to discuss the question.
HOLOUICH ROUNICK
Tony Holouich and Miss Helen
Rounick of Leadwood, two of the high
class Russians of that town, were
married in Farmington last Monday
by Justice William Good, who is
something of a specialist in the mat
rimonial line. With "a photograph
free if married by me", the delighted
couple went on their way rejoicing,
and may it be a long and happy one.
W. C. Eaves
County Recorder
Passes Away
W. C. Eaves, Recorder of Deeds of
St. Francois County, died at his home
in Farmington last Tuesday, Febru
ary 1, 1910, after a lingering illness
of some months. Perhaps no man is
more universally known in the county
or more generally loved by those who
knew him, men, women and children,
than was "Daddy Eaves," as he was
affectionately called. He possessed
that genial fellowship and kindness
of heart that attracted to him all who
came within the sphere of his influ
ence, and the writer never heard him
utter an unkind word about any one
and perhaps an ungenerous thought
of any one never clouded his mind.
His death is universally regretted,
and his cheerful smile and kindly
greetings will be missed by scores
of our people.
Mr. Eaves was born in Dent coun
ty, Missouri, April 22, 1853, and was
therefore in the sixty-third year of
his age. For some months prior to
his death he suffered with asthma
and kidney trouble, and during the
past summer took a trip of several
weeks West in the hope of improving
his condition. He came back some bet
ter of the asthma and it was hoped
that the improvement might prove
permanent, but other complications
set in, and for some weeks past he
had been confined to his home. He
was twice married, his second wife
surviving him. He was the father of
six children, five of whom are living,
together with twenty-two grand
children. Several years ago he unit
ed with the Baptist Church at Des
loge, and his walk in life was guid
ed by a gentle Christian faith and
good will for his fellowman.
He was a 32d degree Mason and was
associated with a number of lodges
and benevolent organizations, among
them the A. F. & A. M., the I. O. O. F.,
the K. of P., the M. W. A., the Yeo
mans and others. In 1910 he was
elected ".fceeordf -i'f Deeds of St,
Francois county on the Republican
ticket, and re-elected to the same of
fice in 1914, a position which he has
faithfully filled.
The funeral took place from the
First Baptist Church yesterday
(Thursday) afternoon, Rev. O. H.
L. Cunningham, the pastor, conduct
ing the religious services, and he was
laid at rest in the Masonic cemetery
with the beautiful rites of the Ma
sonic order.
Requiescat in pace.
Improve Sani
tary Conditions
Since the recent suggestion in The
Times, as to Farmington's need of
improved sanitary conditions, we have
heard many remarks indicating that
many of the citizens of this city are
at least taking serious thought of
this most important matter. It is but
natural that Farmington's citizenship
should have become apparently more
or less careless about improving its
sanitary condition, as the city is so
healthfully located, and has always
been immune to epidemics of all
rkinds.
But this city is constantly growing,
and as population increases so does
the need for better sewerage. All such
a citizenship as this needs is to be
aroused to its apparent needs, and the
ultimate result will be for this city's
good. The Times, therefore, feels
content that it has aroused them
from their false sense of security, and
wc now feel confident that plans will
ere long begin to formulate for the
building of just such a sewerage sys
tem in Farmington as well protect the
health and life of this community.
This is the one thing needed to make
this little city in every respect ideal
as a residence place.
Residence Partly
Destroyed by Fire
About midnight Wednesday the
fire alarm whistle awakened the quiet
of the night. The lire proved to be
at the residence of A. C. Devan, on
Potosi street. Prompt arrival of the
Fire Laddies with their hose and good
work saved the main part of the
building, but the one-story ell, in
which was the kitchen and where the
fire started, was burned. The front
part of the building, a two-story struc
ture, was saved by dint of hard work,
only the roof being damaged.
The Merging of
Carleton-Marvin
Impracticable
Says Rev. Dr. Crissman Would
Build $1,000,000 Methodist Uni
versity in St. Louis.
A $1,000,000 Methodist university in
St. Louis as the solution of the edu
cational problem of Missouri's Meth
odism, North and South, is advocated
by Rev. Dr. B. F. Crissman, district
superintendent of the St. Louis dis
trict, says the Republic.
Dr. Crissman's advocacy followed
his announcement that the proposed
union between Marvin College at
Fredericktown, Mo., and Carleton
College at Farmington, Mo., had been
abandoned because of financial obli
gations. For more than a year efforts had
been made to unite the two institutions
representing the two dominant Meth
odisms. Marvin is a Southern Missouri in
stitution, while Carleton is operated
by the Methodist Episcopal Church.
Dr. Crissman gave out the following
statement yesterday:
"I consulted with Dr. H. P. Crowe,
presiding elder in Farmington, and Dr.
W. C. Macurdy, President of Carle
ton. I also consulted with members
of the special commission on merg
ing the two institutions.
"It was agreed that it was imprac
tical to unite the schools at this time.
Financial difficulties make the union
impracticable.
"The two denominations through
out the territory served by these
schools are in greater harmony and
close fellowship than ever before."
Dr. Crissman, when asked what
would be the best solution of the edu
cational problem of the two Meth
odisms in Missouri, said:
"My own personal opinion is that
such a solution lies in the two great
churches to unite in establishing a
truly great school in St. Louis. Such
a school should have at least a mil
lion dollar ii wl.Ich to beglr-.
"The two churches are certain to
be reunited soon, and it would be
most fitting that the Methodists of
Missouri should have a great school
in Missouri's greatest city."
WORDS OF COMMENDATION
Judge Jerre S. Gossom of Caruth
ersville is renewing his subscription
to The Times, writes us:
"How long do you think you will
maintain the paper up to its present
standard? I have been a subscriber
of The Times for many years, but af
ter Theo. D, Fisher severed his con
nection with it, the paper has not been
kept up to the high standard former
ly maintained by Mr. Fisher. Lately
it has been somewhat improved, and
I trust you may be able to get it back
to itself again, to-wit, a genuine Dem
ocratic paper, clean in politics and ad
vocating the doctrine of true democ
racy." We thank the Judge for the com.
pliment implied in his question, and
answer by saying that it is our inten-
I tion and hope to make The Times bet
ter than it ever was, even under the
old-time management of Mr. Fisher.
If determined effort and conscientious
work count for anything we are going
to do that very thing. As to politics,
the present manager is a Democrat
from away back, as other papers he
has published in the State will attest,
and we expect to continue to "hew
straight to the line."
Again we thank the Judge for his
good words, which will act as a sort
of spur to us to do our very best; and
as we have heard somewhat of the
Judge through his old friends here,
we want to congratulate him on the
report that many of his newer friends
down in the Twenty-eighth Judicial
Circuit are urging him to step up
higher and occupy the bench of that
circuit.
Big Blow at Annapolis
A small hurricane has visited this
section since I last wrote you. Four
teen trees near town were turned up,
the roof was blown off of Gus Funk's
hay barn, north of the school house,
Mr. Culley's porch was blown away,
went over Nath Sutton's farm and took
the roof off his house; lots of fencing
blown down around town, and the
roof taken off W. H. Dunn's black
smith shop, and part of the roof taken
from John T. Webb's brewery and
feed store. Fortunately no one was
hurt Ironton Register, Annapolis
