Henderson County roads in particu
i
lar, a citizen who is as well posted on
these matters as any other person in
the county, said recently:
"This subject has always had a
warm spot in my heart and I will be
more than glad to see the work con-
tinued The county already has a
reputation for good retids ana tnas j

proper push and energy and the com -

The county can be made an example.,

amount of money; -which is -the most
essential thing for poor and sparsely

and maintain good roads with a very
limited amount of money she will not

It is certainly wonderful how uni
versal the Ford car has become in
Henderson county. The farmers are
buying Rapidly and to travel of the
county roads without peeing a Ford on
the road or in a barn on the side of the
road is rather remarkable.
The part that the Ford car is playing
in North Carolina can be seen from the
editorial from the Charlotte Observer
vliich is reproduced below:
