BONDS FAIL TO CARRY
The people have spoken and the
proposed issue of bonds for streets
to the amount of $50,000 were vot
ed down in Tuesday's election. Very
few times in the history of High
Point have improvement bonds
been defeated, in fact it seemed
that .he people were bond hungry
at oil times.
But in Tuesday's election it was
different. Several things contribut
ed lo the defeat of the bonds this
time but the most important (and
it's no use to deny it) was the temp
er of the voters who were disfran
chised by an act of the legislature
last year in naming the city govern
ment without the endorsement of
the voters, and this was one way
they had of showing their disappro
val Another thing the voter analyzed
very carefully was the tax rate
higher than towns and cities all
around us who have so much better
streets and they wondered where
we had fell down on the proposition
and are not convinced that these
small issues every now and then
would greatly remedy matters.
These two things were the main
causes of the defeat of the bonds.
Of course there were those who did
not like this or that man, are at all
times against improvements, etc.,
hui these are in the minority. And
there uere many who swallowed the
bitter pill of dislike in regard to dis
franchisement and voted for the
bonds or the majority against would
have been much larger.
There were not so many voting
a gainst the bonds directly but- of
c wrse these registered and not vot
ing were counted against them. On
the other hand those for bonds fail
ed to show enough votes to carry
the issue, the required number be
ing 430 of which only 359 were se
cured which shows after all that
there was no great demand for bonds
at this particular time in this city
of 12,000 people. In fact there
should have been 500 more on the
registration books than there were
if any great amouriLof interest had J
Deen snown less umu ouu
there should have been 1,400 easy
Finally let it be understood to the
outside world (if it is interested)
that High Point did not vote the
bonds down solely on account of the
improvements they would bring but
from a principle through which it is
hoped a lesson has been learned
tnat will re-art to the best interests
of our city.
When the proper time comes no
doubt tie voters will agree to vote
money for necessary improvements,
if they are given the consideration
they are entitled to as freemen
the rifciht of suffrage on all matters
affecting their interests, instead cf
a bedy of legislators from every part
of the state acting the "billy goat"
for us by "having already" voted
through an act oflheirs, denying
us this God given right as citizens
and tux payers and who are more
vitally interested than the law
makers.
As the Review pointed out before
the election if a bond issue large
enough to pave the streets wa3 be
fore the people they would probably
vote for it, with the understanding,
however, that the property owners
would not be required to pay any
part of it, only their proportion of
the cost through taxes. An issue
of $250,000 or $300,000 would pro
bably do the work and it may be a
"blessing in disguise" that the bonds
were lost Tuesday, if this can be'ac
oompiishtd The tabulated vote is as follows:
For Against
Ward 1. 123. 29
Ward 2. ..87 21
Ward 3... 53 ..53
Ward 4 ..96 ..80...
Totals 359 183
853
Total vote against bonds 494
Total vote for bonds 359
Necessary to carry bods 430
Number of votes lacking 71
While only 183 votes were cast
against the bonds, yet the 311 not
voting but registered, were counted
against them. The election was a
clean cut, orderly on.
"God Bless the Third"
Rushing into our office yesterday
with face beaming like Sunny Jim
was a second warder who exclaimed
"God bless the third". Who do you
mean, king George the Third? we
asked. "No, man. no the third
ward if it hadn't been for the
third the bonds would have carried".
The Third ward now seems to hold
the 4 balance of power" politically
and otherwise and no doubt some
tilt "ccurting' will be done in that
direct iou nereauer.

his home on Morris street from an
gina pectoris. The funeral services
were held from the home Monday
afternoon, conducted by Rev. A. G.

ber. Mr. McPherson was a brave Con

and a loyal and true soldier of peace
since. He was a member of High

and Jackson in the celestial empire
where there i no more strife or
trouble.

Why You Should Trade in
High Point, N. C.
The following is the prize winning
letter in the contest closing Feb. 25
on 'why you should trade in High
Point,"
1. Because you are a part of the
city or the community.
2 Because every dollar spent in
the community is a direct benefit
to you.
3. Because as a loyal member of
the "big family" you should protect
its interests in a business way the
same as you would ,your household
in a fatherly way.
4. Because the merchants and
business houses of High Point pay
their part of the taxes and help
share the burdens incidental to a
livelihood.
5. Because the mail order houses
or other towns have no interest in
common with yours and do not con
tribute towards your welfare.
6. Because the merchants here
are your friends in time of need as
well as of prosperity.
7. Because you will save money
by buying here and be protected in
what you buy.
8. Because by your loyalty there
is made possible a greater High
Point in every way.
9. Because then all with one ac
cord can say: "Come, live with us
and prosper"- High Point, the city
of Do Things.
