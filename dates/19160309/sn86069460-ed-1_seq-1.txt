NOTICE TO ALL
THECITIZENS
Dr. Ceo. W. Stone Moves to the
Jenkins Building-Interesting
Facts Concerning Location.
I have moved my optical office
to the Record-Press building, on
ground floor in room back of the
Postal Telegraph office and S. M.
Jenkins' office, where I will be
glad to do your optical work for
less money than you can get the
best work done, on earth. You
will find me in my office on Sat
urdays and Mondays until the
first of August at grently re
duced prices. After thatdateever
day for forty-two years.
Now it will be no trouble to
find my office. There are five
ways you can get in. You can
comedown through the basement
and up the steps right into my
ollice, or through the barber shop
or through Miss Mary Cameron's
telegraph office, or through S.
M. Jenkins' office, or come up
the little short street and turn
square to the left, and don't run
against that post, but come to
the second door and there you
are, in my oilice.
This is one of the handsomest
buildings in Kentucky and more
omveniencies than any buildingin
the United States. First we have
a tailoring and pressing ollice
run by Huffman and Cook. Now
he don't cook, that is his name,
and they clean and press your
clothes while you wait. All you
have to do is step down in the
basement and shed your clothes.
They will send a blind boy
down and get them and return
them by same boy in a few min
utes.
Next you step into the Barber

We also handle Ford parts, made by the Ford Motor Company,
for the Ford car, sold on the same guarantee as the Ford car.
Shop where there are three of
the handsomest barbers I have
ever seen, in one bunch. They
will shave you so quick and easy
you will be surprised. Also, in
same shop, get your shoes shined
so you will not need a mirror for
several days to see yourself.
Then come through the door
into my office and get fitted with a
pair of glasses in pure gold
frames, or rimless with gold
mounting, for $1.00 with centex
lenses, the best on earth. These
lenses go with every frame or
eye glass. I fit alumino frames
with same lenses for $2.00. Also
nice leather case goes with each
pair.
Now when you get your glass
es go right through the door and
Miss Mary Cameron will sell you
any paper or magazine you want
for less than the paper costs
they are printed on and from the
same ollice you can send a tele
gram anywhere on earth.
And then through another door
and behold S. M. Jenkins, the
editor of The Crittenden Record-
Press, with three or four of the
best looking "Little Devils" you
ever saw. You can advertise in
this paper anything you want to
sell or buy and the cost is noth
ing compared with results you
get Also all kinds of job work
turned out by this force.
Now in same building, on sec
ond floor, we have a dentist Dr.

you in just a few moments. So

five ways to get into my office.

line you want for less money

A CUD SURPRISE.
All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy. The same is
true of Mary in fact young and
old of both sexes enjoy a little
relaxation now and then. Ac
cordingly, after a long and
dreary winter of quilting, sew
ing, bazaar and other charitable
work, Mrs. S. M. Jenkins in the
kindness of her heart enter
tained for the sewing circle of
the First Presbyterian church,
on last Thursday evening at her
new home.
The house with its spacious
halls, parlors and reception rooms
is an ideal place for gather
ings and the snow and gloom
outside enhanced the coziness
and light of the interior. Sever
al contests were provided, but
the most enjoyable one was the
playing of old melodies on the
Italian harp, which were quickly
recognized by the guests, a few
of whom were on the shady side
of life, showed plainly there was
music in their hearts and awaken
ed memories that had lain dorm
ant for years.
Refreshments, consisting of
salad, creamed chicken, hot
rolls, apricot Bavarian cream and
collee were served in the daint
iest of hand-painted china, after
which the health of the hostess
and family was drunk in pure
cold water from the well, near
four hundred feet deep, on the
premises. It is said this water
is equal to the famous White
Sulphur Springs in the moun
tains of West Virginia.
The only thing that marred
the pleasure of the afternoon was
the unavoidable absence of a few
esteemed members. If the way
to be happy i3 to do for othprs
and who can doubt it, our host
ess deserves to be happy indeed.
A Guest.
Marion's New Marshall
Has Birthday Dinner.
People around town were won-
dering Monday why the new
City Marshall had some of our
representative citizens in charge.
He was taking them oh a prom
enade when first observed in the
early afternoon. Among the
number were noted the follow
ing: M. Y. Nunn, G. H. Nunn,
J. A. Chandler. T. H. Cochran.
J. N. Boston, J. W. Weldon, V.
0. Ciandler and some others,
who in company of the Marshall
were seen coming in Shady Grove
street, in the neighborhood of
the Marion Mill. People will talk
you know, and soon many ton
gues were wagging, and finally
some of the nerviest ones ven
tured to question Mr. George
Boston as to why such a "haul"
had been made. One of the een
tlemen spoke up immediately and
said: "It was us who made the
haul, and if you had seen that
spread whfch Mrs. Boston pre
pared you would agree with us
that it was indeed us who made
the haul. George didn't have a
thing to do with this. His wife
surprised him by invitineinsome
irieuds for dinner, and oh, ray!
what a dinner.
The new marshall (who by the
way has one of the best wies
on the earth) was 58 years old
Monday. March 6th. hence the
dinner party.

Important Notice.
The high cost of all printer's
stocks now, including the "white
news" on which we print the
Crittenden Record-Press neces
sitates an advance all along the
line, but in order to give all sub
scribers a chance to pay up, and
renew at the old price $1.00, we
will accept subscriptions at that
price during this month. We
cannot afford to mail out any
more papers to parties in arrears
and are now culling out all such i
names as rapidly as we can do
the work. J

DREAM OF PAST
TO COME TRUE
Old Eddyville And Princeton Turn
pike to be Remetalled in
The Near Future.
Some people not over half
century of age remember well .
when the old stage-coach made
its trips from Hopkinsville via '
Princeton and Eddyville to Smith-
land. This was in the latter
60s and early 708. One of the
places to change horses was at
Frank Gardner's on the old pike
five miles from Princeton. This i
pike was virtually abandoned af
ter the railroad was built, but
is now to be rehabilitated as
stated in a telegram fromlPrince
ton, which says:
"The citizens living along the
pike came before the fiscal court,
Tuesday, with a proposition to
raise 1,750 for the purpose of
aiding the county and State in
macadamizing the old Eddyville
pike, provided that the fiscal '
court would select that road and
set aside an equal amount for it3
construction this year.
The fiscal court believing that
it is the best policy to accept
every dollar that is given to the
county for building road, accept
ed the propsition, provided-the '
money or its equivalent was de
posited with the county treasur
er before the first day of March,
which is the last day for making: '
application for State-aid this
year.
So the citizens along this road
got busy and in a very short
time the money was subscribed
and a bond-Jox the payment of , ,
the same was deposited with'the
county clerk, K. L. Gresham.
This money will be paid by the
first of May, or when the fiscal
court calls for it"
