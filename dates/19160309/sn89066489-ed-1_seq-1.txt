BUTLER MISSOURI. TUESDAY, MARCH 9. 1916.

To the Gitiseni , of Butler and
VJoinity.
Many yean ago I resided in this
eommiinity, ' Ho me itis4ome. I
have observed the improvements
of the town both public and pn
vate with keen interest. Your
splendid Court House does credit
to the "County and is no doubt the
pride of its citizens. ; .
. You have, as a municipality
shown" your intelligent interest in
education, by providing adequate
buildings' for your ward schools
and; especially you. have done
yourselves nonor m me erection
of your splendid modern High
School Building. But you are be
hind in adequate buildings for the
worship of God. Many smaller
' cities and towns In the State sur
pass you in this respect. You
scarcely have one modern house
of worship in your city. One can
not witness the interest taken here
in the moral and religious uplift
of the people and believe that this
condition 'fitly ' represents the
spirit and sentiment of your peo
ple.
The Baptist people of Butler
have sold their present church
site to the Government for the
erection of a Post Office Building.
They havepurchased the fine va
cant corner at Fine and Delaware
Streets and propose the erection
of a spacious modern house of
worship, to cost not less than -$20,
000.00. This building, if complet
ed'as they are planning it, will be
an ornament to the city and will,
in my judgment enhance the value
of property in the "city by an
amount larger than its cost.
The city has no Y. M. C. A. and
no attractive modern place which
will draw the fine young people
of the community toward the bet
ter things. "It is proposed to pro
vide in this new building all mod
ern features so that the social life
of the people may receive Jhe ben-
' ccnctlon. of a christian atmosphere.
i It is in the mind of the Baptist
people to tender the conveniences
of this modern building to the use
of the whole community, I am told
that ' there is scarcely a fit place
in the city for a church banquet
or anything of the kind so that ev
ery function of this sort is put to
. the trouble to find a place and
then must entail a large expense
to consumate adequate provision,
It is proposed to build into this
spacious edifice a convenient
kitchen with spacious dining room
not to turn God's House into a
place of rendezvous, or merchan
dise but to provide a place where
any Christian Denomination in the
city may sit down together as
Jesus so, often sat down with his
disciples.
This, my friends is an undertak
ing so, large that it would entail
a heavy burden upon any one of
your : congregations to provide
such a place. The only way to
secure such places of worship is
for-the whole people to co-operate
and erect one such structure at
the time. -
In view of these matters, the
Baptist people will at an early
day, solicit a "contribution from
every business . firm and if pos
sible from every citizen of the
city and community. -
The writer is supplying . the
Baptist pulpit, for the time being,
in the hope that he may see erect
ed here a building for the worship
of God, of which the whole com
munity will be proud.
Cordially and respectfully,
. . - S. M. Brown.

Bsidet Boewe Reaches Oermany.
Official statement has been
made by the German general staff
that the German commerce raider
Moewe has succeeded in reaching
a German port. She had on board
199 prisoners and 1,000,000 marks
($250,000) in gold bars.

sels were captured by the Moewe,
which also laid mines at' several
points. One of these mines, it is
stated, sank thie British battle
ship King EdwardVII.
The Moewe, previously made
famous by her exploits, has per
formed one of the most spectacu
lar feats of the war on the seas
by reaching a home port in safe
ty. The great German naval port
of Wilhclmshaven is on the North
Sea, which is patrolled with cease
less vigilance by British warships.
It is through these waters, which
have been blocked off in districts
for patrol by the different Brit
ish units, that the Moewe must
have threaded her way to home
and safety.

CONGBESSLUPHOLDS THE
PRESIDENT.
By a Vote of 256 to 160 Congress
Votes to Back the Presid
ent's Attitude Toward
Oermany.
Washington, March - 7. The
house ofn representatives today
capitulated to President Wilson.
The first test vote on proposals
to warn Americans off belligerent
armed ships showed that the
forces of the administration were
in complete control.
By a vote of 256 to 160 the
houKC carried a motion to limit de
bate on the special rule for the
consideration of the McLemore
warning resolution.
The administration program
called for four hours' debate on
the McLemoro measure, followed
by a motion to lay it on the table.
The first vote indicated' that the
program would go through easily.
The vote came in the midst of
a day of sensational details. Pleas
for support of the president "who
lias carried the greatest national
responsibility of any president
since Lincoln" aroused the house"
to wild enthusiasm. Warnings
that no nation r divided against
itself shall stand" were received
in solemn silence. Excoriation of
American citizens whose "fool
hardiness and recklessness" in
traveling on belligerent ships may
"plunge thq country into war,"
was cheered.
The final argument and appeal
which aroused the house most was
the demand that this country
stand firmly behind the president
in his fight to insure respect for
the rights of American citizens on
the sea. To this plea the big mem
bership on the floor, and the
crowd which overflowed galleries
and corridors, rose with cheers
and applause.
1 The gray-haired, stalwart form
of Speaker Clark stood at the desk
and wielded the gavel vigorous
ly, biit, impotently, in his efforts
to restrain them. At times the
house was in tumult.
When the vote was announced a
hush of silence swept over the
chamber, followed by a sigh of
relief, as the members of the
crowd realized that the president
was sure of a big majority of the
house behind him in. his foreign
poliey.
