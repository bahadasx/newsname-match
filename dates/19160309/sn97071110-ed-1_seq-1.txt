"A third service, so commonplace that
its value is perhaps not fully realized, lies
in holding the customer's deposit balance
and paying it out as ordered by the custo
mer's checks, under the risk of forged
checks and numerous other risks, to say
nothing of expenses. Besides these, there
are the numerous minor or special services,
like making collections of all kinds; fur
nishing business information, suggestions
or occasional advice, if desired, relating to
business in general or in particular; obtain
ing special information through its corre
spondents; transferring funds from place
to place by telepraph; and, in fact, any re
spectable service that an obliging bank is
capable of performing with its extensive
facilities, or having performed by any of
its officers or employees."

The year 1856 was one of anxiety to
the few and scattered inhabitants of
eastern Oregon and Washington. Ru
mors of an impending Indian outbreak
filled the air tame with the winter's
snows, but did not go with them.
For a year the columns of the Weekly
Oregonian had been filled with ac
counts of the barbarous tortures in
flicted upon helpleBs immigrants who
fell into the hands of hostile hordes in
the eastern part of the territory. The
question then with the wretched pris
oners was not how long before a ran
soms or exchange would set them free,
but how long before death would re
lease them from the infernal tortures
inflicted by their captors. Once in
their clutches few escaped to tell the
awful tale.
The powerful Yakima nation, led by
the noted Chief Kamiaken. were prac
tically on the war path, and their emis
saries were everywhere urging me
Columbia river tribes to join in a war
of extermination against the whites.
The Klickitats, an important branch of
the Yakimas, withstood for a time the
importunitites of their inland brothers
and gave up their arms to the authori
ties without a word ; but the magot oi
unrest was industriously working in
the "military biain," and the arrest of
three of the principal chiefs of the
tribe was decided upon. Mr. Joslyn,
the pioneer settler of White Salmon, a
warm-hearted Christian gentleman and
an earnest friend of the Indians, pro
tested in Vain against the outrage. The
unsuspecting chiefs were easily trap
ped, loaded with chains, sent to Van
couver and placed in charge of the reg
ular army. They soon found means to
evade the vigilence of their guards and
returned to their tribe, who, with a
few notable exceptions, at once joined
the hostiles.
v This occurred during the latter part
of February, 1856. Mr. Joslyn, satis
fied that trouble would follow the ar
rest of the chiefs, had removed with bis
family to Portland, leaving a hired
man named Galentine and a boy named
Hawks to look out for the place. An
attack was at once planned by the
anorv chiefs, but the friendly Indians
notified them of the plot and they left
the place and crossed to Hood River,
after beine chased all night by the
hostiles. For this act of friendship to
the whites the friendly Indians were
compelled to leave their homes and

hrnthers-in-law. making with our fam
ily and the man named Galentine seven
men, two women ana two uuys, cum
peeing the entire white population be
the Cascades and The Dalles.
Our farm work thus far bad been
done very much as the Jews had re
builded Jerusalem, with implements of
war in one nana ana a irowei in an
other. Manv a dav have 1 urged on

troublous times. The hostile Klicki
tats made themselves very conspicuous
ftlang the bluffs on the Washington
shore above White Salmon. For days
(ho war drama had beat continuously,
fiilin our hearts with forebodings of
trouble.

w did not much like the job, but
could not help it ; but before we had
fnund the cattle we ssw the smoke

ried home as fast as our feet could
carry us. We found the cavalry had
arrived, and their coming was the stg
Kfll for the burning. Tbe valorous lieu
marshaled his forces on the
anrihar. and hsilins the steamer Was
co on her way to Tbe Dalles, started
for the seat of war. My two brothers
and the two Benaona bad gone with tbe
troops; also Amos Underwood, who
was on his way to the Cascades, was
one of the party. How the Indiana did
yell I The cliffs were alive with them,
and their war whoops echoed and re
echoed across the river. The valiant
lieutenant, ere he reached the landing.
suddenly remembered that he bad or
ders not to molest the Indians in Wash
ington, but merely to protect the set
tlers and their property at Hood River,
and ordered tbe boat to land him again
on the uregon snore. Discretion in
this case was certainly the better part
of talor, for it undoubtedly saved him
his scalp and that or every memDer oi
his party that was to have landed on
the hostile shore.
That night, by some means, a band
of hostiles crossed tbe river and at
tacked the camp of friendly Klickitats,
near where the section bouse now
stands, and after a sharp exchange of
shots, in which one of tbe invsders was
seriously wounded, the friendlies left
their camp and came trooping up to
the house. Soon after the hostiles
came across some of the cavalry picket
guard and opened fire on tbem, which
sent them scurrying to camp. These
men were posted on the brow of the hill
near where my house now stands, so
that evidently the Indians were recon
noitering and unexpectedly ran across
the guards. Everybody was, of course,
un and under arms, dui noining eise
occurred during the night.
The next day all was quiet across tne
river, the Indiana naa gone; not a
sauaw. DBDOoae nor duddv was leu.
They had disappaered as completely
as if the earth had swallowed them up.
Even the friendly Klickitats were at a
loss to account for their absence. Ah,
but the Cascade massacre wss the
dreadful sequel of their vanishing.
A few dsya later tbe cavalry re
turned to The Dalles, and the daily
routine of farm work was resumed, un
disturbed, until the awful horror of the
26th day of March. What a bright
beautiful dav it was 1 Tbe broad bos-
som of the Columbia was like mirrored
glass. My two yoke of oxen were
yoked to tbe wagon, and brother Charles
was denutiied as special guard ior tne
day's trip to Rail gulch for a load of
rails. Just as we were ready to start
a faini halloa was heard from over the
river, near the mouth of White Salmon.
Again and again it came. Finally, two
figures were made out, waving their
blankets. The Indians collected at the
house, hesitating, fearing a trap, but
finally, fully armed, a party started
over to investigate. Before their re
turn we had gone for our day s worn.
About two o'clock, when on our way
borne, my brother, Eugene, came tid
ing up on horesback with the news
that the Cascades had been attacked
and that the battle was then raging,
and told us to hurry home as fast as
possible. The appalling news tell like
thunderbolt irom tne clear saies.
The battle going on, or possibly over,
and an elder brother there, perhaps
dead.
RAINFALLS UN
PRECEDENTED TOTAL FALL SINCE JAN. 1, 18 INCHES
While Unusual Precipitation Delays Orch
ard Work, Crops for the Year
Will Be Benefited
The rainfall for the eeason has been
unprecedented. The records of Co
operative Weather Observer Birge, of
Edgewood orchard on the West side.
showed that about 171 inches of rain
had fallen up to 5 o'clock Tuesday
night. More than a half inch of precip
itation has prevailed aince then. The
amount of rain since the first of the
year is more than a half a foot more
than fell last year between January 1
and November 1. However, the rain
fall for the first of last year was slight
ly under normal.
While the rain is delsying the early
spring work of orchardists. it is consid
ered that it will be of inestimable ben
efit to crops of all lines the coming
summer. It is predicted that the
strswberries will be of excellent size
and quality.
The rainy winter, it is prophesied,
will be followed by a dry summer sea
son, an ideal condition for an apple
crop, and with the keen interest that
prevails In better spraying, riood Kiv
er fruit should be of a clean, excellent
quality the coming year.
While the loot oi snow tnat prevailed
over the Lower Valley last week was
the cause of a great deal of inconven
ience, it tended to retard the growth of
friut buds and delay the blossoming
season. This condition is welcomed by
orchardists, as it is hoped the blooms
will not open until after the usual cool
rainy weather of eary May, when pol
lenizstion of cherries is often prevent
ed. Two feet of new snow fell in the Upper
Valley around Parkdale, and it is re
ported that at the present time a blan
ket of four feet of snow is on the
ground at Homer Rogers' Mount Hood
Lodge. At the Green Point mill of the
Stanley-Smith Lumber Co. the snow
has been 15 feet deep, having been
piled up to the second story windows of
the company's office building. While
the heavy fall will delay the operation
of the big mill slightly, it will insure
water a plenty for the transportation
of the lumber by flume to Ruthton.
The winter's bad weather has given
the greatest trouble to the Mount Hood
Railway Co. Traffic to Dee was again
retarded last Saturday when a slide
100x20 feet blocked a cut just south of
the city. The debris was cleared out
by Monday. Slides, however, continue
to block the line between Dee and
Parkdale.
ASSOCIATION PRIMARY
