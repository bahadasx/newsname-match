:
In tlie middle of the street, lying
on the snow between the car tracks
and exposed to the bitter wind and
biting sleet, a mother gave girth to
a son Monday at 7.
The. husband, a stranger in the
city and out of employment, knelt
beside her, trying to shield her
from the wind and to comfort her
in her anguish.
Not 10 minutes before, the police
say. the woman was denied admit
tance by the management of To
ledo hospital and was denied at
tendance by a physician living
near that institution.
Insistent nature called a halt in
the middle of the street and the
woman fell to the snow, where she
immediately gave birth to the
child, a line, bright boy. Pedes
trains were attracted to the scene
and found the babe lying in the
snow, its little' lungs sending forth
lustry wails. Toledo Blade. '
HOME GUARDS RATIFY
MERGER WITH A. I. U.
10,609 File Written Ratification.
Canton, O., Feb. 25. In August,
1915, the Home Guards of Amer
ica, with headquarters at Van
"Wert, O., voted at their Canton
meeting to merge with the Ameri
can Insurance Union of Columbus,
Q. A few members of the Home
Guards objected to the merger be
cause the proposition was not sub
mitted to the individual members
for approval instead of the Su
preme Home. The American In
surance Union then submitted the
matter to the individual members
of the Home Guards and up to date
10,509 have filed their individual
written approval of the merger.
As there were only 11,520 members
at the time of the merger in Au
gust, and the ratifications are still
coming in at the rate of twenty
five or thirty a day, it is apparent
that the ratification will be sub
stantially unanimous.
Last night the two former Home
Guard lodges of this city joined
with the A. I. U. lodge in giving a
ratification banquet to the Na
tional Officers of the A. I. U., and
it proved to be one of the finest
and largest banquets ever given in
the history of fraternalism in Can
ton. The Court of Last Resort.
Around the stove of the cross roads
grocery is the real-court of last resort,
for it finally rules all others. Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy has been
before this court in almost every cross
roads grocery in this country, and has
always Teceived a favorable verdict. It
is in the country where man expects to
receive full value for his money that
this remedy is most appreciated. For

Instead of the weekly meeting, a
"hare and hound" chase was held
last Monday.
Many of the boys have passed
their second class tests.
When a boy applies for admis
sion into scout movement, his ap
plication is first considered by the
registered scouts of the troop. If
ho is elected ho must then take the
tenderfoot 'test. The requirement
of this is that each boy know the
history and composition of the
American flag, know the scout sign
and its significance, be able to tie
four knots, know the twelve scout
laws, and give the scout oath. The
oath that every scout takes is : On
my honor I will do my best,
1. To do my duty to God and
my country, and to obey the scout
law.
2. To help other people at all
times.
3. To keep myself physically
strong, mentally awake, and
morally straight.
Paul and Dave Hoffman of
Grand Rapids, Ohio, visited their
cousin Scout Stanley Thurlby, last
Sunday.
Mr. Cole and Edmund Schuster
attended the Scoutmaster's meet
ing in the Nicholas building on
Wednesday evening.
Many of the scouts figure on at
tending the box social at the high
school auditorium on Thursday
evening.
The scouts will usher at the final
number of the lecture course,
which will be given Saturday
night.
Chas. Bayers, Jr., of the Stag
Patrol, is a first-class scout. Earl
Lauraan is the only other scout of
our troop with this honor.
The Stag Patrol's hike east is
being prepared.
SECURES STATE HELP
Highway Commission Will Appro
priate $3,000 for Market Road.
Capt. George Greenhalgh, who
has had charge of the legal end of
the effort to secure State appropri
ation for the Market road passing
through Perrysburg, was notified
Wednesday that the State High
way Commission would appropri
ate S3,000 to the fund for the road.
This amount will be added to the
S2.000 made available by the
county, and will be sufficient to
warrant the completion of all nec
essary legislation so that the work

THE NEW SCHOOL HOUSE
Shall Wo Give Perrysburg Chil
dren a Modern Building?
Are the children of any other
place better than the children of
Perrysburg' Do others deserve
hotter conditions .around them
than your children? Ask your
self these questions, and then stop
to consider. Instead of having
your children, for five days each'
week, under conditions similar to
the very poorest in the country,
why not have them surrounded hy
the school comforts equal to the
best. These things can be changed
with a very little cost to each of
the citizens of Perrysburg. Since
such is the case it is really hard to
understand why people have to he
urged in the matter. The aim and
interest of everyone centers in his
'child. Ask a parent why he is
working so hard and he will say
that his child may have greater
advantage than he has had.
The health .of the children is a
mattor of the greatest considera
tion. Wealth without health can
not bring happiness. There is
sure to be sickness and physical
we.akncss resulting from condi
tions such as we have in our
school. Rooms that were made to
house 30 children are now provid
ing space for twice that number.
What .will be tho answer to that?
Well, just think of it when your
child has its next cold, or tonsilitis,
or some other illness. In that you
have your answer. GO in the first
grade, with half day work. 60
each in the second and third
grades, but with a pressure re
moved somewhat by a divided
grade.
About 50 in the fourth grade.
About the same number in the
fifth grade. More than that num
ber in the sixth. And next year
the seventh grade will have more
than 60. One grade is now out
side in a room that cannot be used
next year. .Where will it be 'pos
sible to get two rooms outside next
year? Some classes will have to
be out in these rooms over stores
or any place where they can be
obtained. Do you want your child
to go? Do you, or you, or you?
Well, someone's child will have to
go. About 30 children were sent
to tho court house early this year.
About 30 people either, sent or
brought complaints in one day.
And the worst of it was, that they
had good ground for their com
plaints. Well, there is only one answer
to it all, give your children the
best. Vote for the now addition
to tho school, building on April 25.

A' Specific Against Colds.
Tho .nearest thing to n specific
against colds is a sleeping porch or
open bed room and a cold sponge bath
every morning when you first get up.
Even then you will occasionally take
a cold, especially when colds aro epi
demic, and when you do you will find
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy a great
help in enabling you to got rid of it.

A Friend In Need
Is a Friend Indeed
Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.
"Make Lucas county and the
Maumoc valley the garden spot of
the world."
This is the slogan of the Com
merce club and the Lucas county
Improvement society, "says the To
ledo Blade.
It sounds good, brother', but
your little old Commercial club
slogan is too late. Perrysburg, in
WOOD county, has- already been
proclaimed the ONLY "garden
spot."
To organize and incorporate a
$25,000 co-operative company in
40 days and begin business opera
tions is something of a record for
speed in business, we think, and it
is just what was accomplished by
the Perrysburg Grain & Seed Com
pany, and it is "a mighty healthy
youngster.
Thus far .the month of March
has been doing fairly well. The
seed catalogues have arrived, and
the neighbors' chickens are ready
to scratch, all of which are signs
of spring.
The Auditorium movie theatre
will close to the public during lent,
but many changes and impVove
ments will be made that will give
additional seating capacity and
other features that will prove very
acceptable to the patrons of the
theatre that has been winning
favor from the date of its opening.
Work is expected to be under
way very soon on the construction
of the Old Ladies' Ilome that is to
be erected on land donated by
Adam Leydorf about four miles
south of Perrysburg.
"Baby born on Street" is heading
on first page of Toledo Bla'de. On
the same page is an illustration
of a business man holding a ban
ner on which is inscribed "I Live
in Toledo." After reading the
story of the "Babe born in the
snow" he must feel proud to think
he lives in a city where "charity"
has closed its doors to a woman;
where the spirit of kindness and
"brotherly love" will turn the cold
shoulder to one of God's creatures
seeking a retreat that she may
render to humanity the most sacred
of woman's priviledge and duty.
Well, in part history is merely re
peating. Ages ago a man and wo
man sought refugo under similar
conditions, but were compelled to
go to a stable where the babe was
born and placed in a manger. In
Toledo, however, the police found
a place for the mother and child
and the newspapers are seeking
help for them as well as employment
for the father. It's a good thing
there aro newspapers and police in
Toledo otherwise tlie town would
have gono to h 1 long ago. '

Just how to feed an animal in
order that it may make the most
profit is a problem which many
farmers are asking. It is known
that dairy cows give milk in
amounts directly in proportion to
the kind of feed they receive and
often the profits arc cut down be
cause a balanced ration is not
maintained. To meet the requests
coming from all parts of the coun
try on profitable feeding, W. II.
Palmer has prepared a handy
booklet on "The Feeding of Farm
Animals."
Treating seed oats for smut with
the formalin solution this year will
save the farmers of Ohio more
than $500,0(10, according to the
Farm Crops Department, Ohio
State University. Oat smut is said
to be very prevalent because of the
adverse harvesting conditions last
year. Tlie seedlike spores of the
smut pass the winter in the grain
and when the untreated kernel
sprouts in the spring, the spores
begin to grow and develop a little
plant within the oat plant. The
dustlike spores, given off by the
little plant near harvest time blow
to the other oat plants and infect
the grain from which next year's
seed must be selected. To treat
oats with the formalin solution se
cure formalin at a drug store and
mix a pint with 40 gallons of
water. The oats may be sacked
and dipped into a barrel of this
solution until they are thoroughly
soaked or they may be piled upon
the barn floor and sprinkled with
the solution. After the treatment
they should be covered with blank
ets for four or five hours so that
the formalin will not evaporate too
quickly.
"Light is cheaper than feed and
more beneficial than gallons of
germicides," states Frederick W.
Ives, professor of Farm Architec
ture, Ohio State University, in re
plying to the many requests that
come to him about lighting the
barn properly. "Every barn
should have at least four square
feet of window space to each ani
mal and in dairy barns this should
be increased to six or eight square
fee."
Gather up and remove from the
orchard all branches and twigs
