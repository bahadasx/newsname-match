POLITICS
[ CHAPTER 1
I Wherein the Editor Does a
Little Keynoting
BY THE EDITOR
About the next bitf tiling Tat'ouia must do
I is to elci-t two city commissioners.
In a series of page-one chats J want to <lis
vcuss with you voters of Tacoma what sort of
men ought to be chosen, and why.
■ * *
I am sure it is needless to say in the begin
ning that The Times is no slate-maker. It is
not our business nor our desire to plot the per
sonal advancement or the personal downfall of
this politician or that. We don't believe in
using newspapers for that purpose.
But The Times does believe in good govern
ment, and it is ready to fight at all times for
good government.
When the candidates all are in the field and
the issues begin to take form, then The Times
doubtless will be found definitely out for cer
tain candidates and against certain others. It
is not our nature to be a neuter.
* * * ■ — ■
Now a general word about your attitude,
Mr. and Mrs. Voter, as you begin your duty of
weighing the men who come seeking your suf
frage.
Hear in mind from tlie start that a commis
sioner under our charter must perform two
very distinct types of service.
First, he administers whatever department
his fellows assign him.
Second, he is a legislator.
* * #
Speaking generally, our present city council
is a satisfactory city council if you are to
judge it only from the standpoint tff the way
the five individuals composing it run their re
spective departments.
Of course criticisms could he made. There
are too many employes in some departments;
there arc inefficient employes in some; the
baneful effect of politics is noticeable in some
—but on the whole the administrative work of
the commissioners is up to about as high an
average as could be expected.
* # #
It is in their law-giving that the members of
the present council fall pitifully short.
Their votes on vital questions are bad, in
some cases rotten bad.
The mayor generally votes right about 75
per cent of the time. Lately he has not done
that well. His votes on the T. R. &P. power
franchise a few months ago and on the civil
service resolutions just yesterday were lament
able.
Each of the four other commissioners votes
right about half the time on small issues and
wrong practically all the time on large, vital
questions.
A 9 9
The moral, Mr. Voter, Mrs. Voter and Miss
Voter, is: Don't spend too much time worry
ing about the candidates' ability to direct the
iork of the departments; that is important,
io, but it is only part of your task.
You must choose men who will VOTE
IGHT the maximum number of times on big
sues and little issues.
That means you must select men of intelli
?nce, fearlessness, high principles and judg
eut.
If they possess these qualities they probably
ill succeed in both capacities.

Germany issued a statement to

of the ships violated the Ger

provided that, in event of such a

must first be made.
