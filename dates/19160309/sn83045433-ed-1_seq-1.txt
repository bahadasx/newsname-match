WMS DELAY II PROGRAM
yea Lord Insists. However, Fleet Is
Better Prepared Than Ever
Before for Clash.
?pselal Cable to The Wabsgtm Heral.
London, March g.-After a day of' bit
ter debate, the House of Commons this
evening passed the government bill pro
viding for a navy of X;0,000 then. The
naval estimates of 1914-15 provided only
for a navy of 151.000 men.
The day's debate turned largely round
the charges made yesterday by Col.
Winston Churchill reflecting on the ad
ministration of the admiralty since he
ceased to be its first lord. Churhill's
attack upon his successor, Arthur Bal
four, has developed into the poitloal sen
sation of the year.
Mr. Balfour today returned blow for
blow. In a speech sprinkled with such
adjectives as "contemptible" and "in
suilting," he openly intimated that
Churchill's motives were base and his
attitude hypocritical. Out of this wash
ing in public of the dirty linen of the ad
miralty has come one highly disturbing
fact:
There has been delay in the completion
of the new British dreadnoughts, Mr. Bal
four admitted this delay today. He at
counted for it partly by saying that gun
and gun mountings designed for the
capital ships had been diverted for the
use of the monitors.
Charges Ieeassteac y. -
Taking up Col. Churehill's suggestion
that Lord Fisher recalled to
e admiralty that he m t infuse it
with more life, Mr. Balfour said:
"Col. Churchill never astonished the
House more than when he demanded the
return of Iord Fisher to the admiralty.
That suggestion was listened to with
profound stupifleation, for Col. Churchill
himself has never made the smallest con
cealment, either In public or private,
of what he thought of Lord Fisher.
"I would regard myself as contemptible
beyond expression if I yielded an inch
to such a demand. Personally, had I
received such a recommendation as did
Lord Fisher, I should have considered it
an insult."
Mr. Balfour described Churchill's
speech as "unfortunate, both in form and
substance, and calculated to arouse
doubts, misgivings and suspicion."
Navy's Power Growing.
"I am not pessimistlc as to the strength
of the fleet," he said. "It is now more
powerful than when Co!. Churchill left
the admiralty. As the months progress,
it will become more powerful still"
Col. Churchill made a five-minute reply.
He would have made a much stronger
speech than he did, he said, only he,
was restrained by public interets. lie
denied that his tatement had gone be
yond the facts and again urged the de
sirability of atta,'hing Lord Fisher's
"great powers' to the admiralty.
Col. Churchill's attack on the admiralty
commanded wide attention in the news
papers today. Mlany editorials arraign
Churchill's motives and suggest that he
desires to return to the cabinet.

with a .Jew to ascertaining whether the
