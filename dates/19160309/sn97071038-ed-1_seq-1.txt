Heppner's new industry, which is
now assured, will be built at the low
est possible cost and yet be able to
manufacture a first grade article.
The new company will be known as
the Morrow County Creamery Com
pany. The following statement has
been made by I. M. Morgan, practical
creamery man, who has charge of the
organization work and who will be
manager of the factory after it is in
operation:
The Morrow County Creamery
Company, as planned to be installed
in Morrow county is to be built at the
lowest possible cost and yet be able
to manufacture a first grade article
from the start. The concern is not to
be made up of a lot of "watered
stock" but each amount of money
will be fully secured, and with the lo
cal market of Morrow county and the
territory that is available for produc
ing the raw material, and the undi
vided support of the entire county,
there can be no doubt but what the
same will be a success and an addi
tional Improvement to the country.
The plan of this enterprise is to
put in a plant to the value of $1500.
which will Install the machinery, and
allow enough money on hand to pay
cash for the cream as received, which
is the base of successful operation of
a creamery. Having had a number
of years of training and practical
work along this line and knowing the
conditions of Morrow county, I feel
that I can make a success of this lit
tle enterprise and will take some
stock in the same.
In case the proposition appeals to
the citizens of Morrow county, the
machinery can be placed on the
ground sometime about the first of
April and ready for operation by the
first of May, as a building can be se
cured that will eliminate the con
struction of a new one.
Anyone interested in the proposi
tion and desiring Information can
reach me by addressing as follows:

HEPPNER ANO LEXINGTON MAY START SOON
Members of the Heppner Commer
cial Club met with the farmers and
citizens of Lexington on Tuesday af
ternoon to discuss Uie proposition of
building a permanent highway be
tween this city and Lexington.
The meeting was held in the Lex
ington theater, with W. E. Leach act
ing as chairman. W. W. Smead, sec
retary of the Heppner Commercial
Club, explained the object of the
meeting saying that the county court
of Morrow county had certain funds
available which they would spend on
a certain piece of road, making it
permanent. The court has decided
that they are willing to start per
manent road work on the- 9 miles
of highway between Heppner and
Lexington. The survey has been
made for the new road and bids re
ceived by the court last spring indi
cate that the entire roadway can be
built for $7000. The court has mon
ey in the general road fund to the ex
tent of $5000. The citizenB of Hepp
ner are willing to raise $1000 by sub
scription. Lexington has been asked
to give over from the district road
tax money whch they will receive,
$1000. This will complete the sum
necessary which t-) county thinks
will insure a permanent road on a
grade, properly drained. After turn
ing over $1000 for this piece of road,
the Lexngton .road supervisor will
still have $900 to use in repairs and
improvements on the other roads in
the district.
After Mr. Smead's introduction of
the subject County Commissioner E.
L. Padberg arose and on behalf of
the county court, corroborated Mr.
Smead's statements. "Now," con
tinued Mr. Padberg, "what the court
wants to know, is, what do the people
of the Lexington road district think
of the proposition." Mr. Padberg in
some general remarks on the road
question asked for the cooperation of
the citizens with the county court
in keeping the roads In good condi
tion, since most of the road money
will necessarily be spent in keeping
the roads In repair.
Campbell Practical Road Man.
W. T. Campbell of Social Ridge,
who lives in the Lexington road dis
trict, discussed the proposed road
from practical sides and took a few
steps into the future. "I would like
to have this, road leading from my
farm gate into town," said Mr. Camp
bell, "but no one realizes better than
I do that I can't have it. The whole
system of road building in tills coun
ty in the past has been wrong. I
have thought over the matter a great
deal and I don't know that I have a
remedy. However, a start has got to
be made Boniewhere and I know of
no road that is more traveled for the
same distance than is the read be
tween Lexington and Heppner. Lets
put the road on a grade, looking to
the future, in the event that we
should ever want to hard surface,
build a standard grade, put in the
proper culverts and keep the road
well drained. Crowning the road is
the one important thing that we
should not overlook." Mr. Campbell
has experimented with roads in his
neighborhood on his own accord, and
he says that by using the road drag,
keeping the center well crowned and
drained he has an excellent road the
year around. When a small wash
out or some other disagreeable mis
hap ocurs to the roads in Mr. Camp
bell's vicinity, he doesn't take a half
day off to go complaining to the coun
ty court, but puts in a half hour of

work repairing the damage. Mr.
Campbell also put some emphasis
on the necessity of using the road
drag.
"I could name no road in the coun
ty that is more traveled than the
Willow creek road between Lexing
ton and Heppner," said Karl Beach,
of Lexington. "I am very much in
favor of the proposed plan as out
lined before us. The almost impas
sable condition of this road the past
year is argument enough that the
new road is needed."
Although the court announces that
they will not begin work on the new
road unless they can let the contract
at $7000 or less, Eph Eskelson, Wil
low creek farmer, stated that he was
very much in favor of starting the
work whether the $7000 would be
sufficient to finish the highway or
not. Mr. Eskelson called attention
to the good condition of the roads
at the mouth of all little gullies and
draws where gravel had washed
down. He explained how he had
taken some of this same gravel and
used it on the roads about his farm.
The result has been highly satisfac
tory and Mr. Eskelson agitates the
use of gravel in surfacing the new
road.
Marsh White says that this is the
one big opportunity for Lexington to
get some real road work. Heretofore
little enough has been spent in the
Lexington road district. Since the
greater part of the road lays in the
Lexington district, the greater part
of the money must necessarily be
spent in that district. He heartily
endorsed the new road plan.
E. L. Reaney and W. F. Barnett
spoke in favor of the proposed road
and Mr. Reaney stated that this was
the best proposition yet presented
for the reason that no additional tax
would be required. "If we keep in
step with civilization and march for
ward with the country around us, we
must build permanent roads," con
cluded Mr. Reaney.
W. G. Scott, Lexington banker,
spoke in favor of spending the dis
trict road tax money on roads lead
ing to the farms. Mr. Scott advo
cates a system of good roads eman
ating from the towns and leading out
to the farming district. A. W. Gam
mell also spoke in favor of Mr.
Scott's suggestions.
Axte taken at the close of the
meeting disclosed the fact that those
present were greatly in favor of the
proposed plan. Just what steps will
be taken by the court nert we have
not learned, but they are being urged
to commence active work as soon as
possible for the reason that this is
the ideal time of the year for road
construction.
Those attending from Heppner
were J. L. Wilkins, I. M. Morgan, W.
W. Smead, L. K. Harlan, who acted
as secretary for the meeting, Robert
Young, E H. Kellogg, J. S. Whitbeck,
Loy M. Turner, Homer Wall, of the
State Highway Commission and Ar
thur R. Crawford.
Morrow County Realty Transfers.
During the past week two realty
transfers were reported at the county
clerk s office which are of some mag
nitude and importance. C. O. Bur-
chell has sold his ranch north of
Lexington consisting of 480 acres
for $11,000. Jerome R. Jackson has
purchased 960 acres from Rulifson &
McKenney, known as the old Shutt
place. Mr. Jackson assumed a $5000
mortgage.

Burbank Day Observed.
Burbank Day was faithfully ob
served by the high school.
Each class planted its tree and the
president of each class dedicated
their respective trees. The Seniors
dedicated their tree to the Primary
grade of Heppner school. Each mem
ber of the class partook of Logan
berry juice and while the dedication
speech was being made the remaining
contents of the bottle were poured on
the three.
The president of the Freshman
class, Miss Cecile Stevens, performed
the ceremonies over the Freshman
tree. In her speech she said that the
Freshmen were considered so green
and awkward that she didn't suppose
their tree would grow good. How
ever, their tree was a stout, thrifty
little tree and ought to do justice to
their class.
Some of the classes did not dedi
cate their trees to anyone in particu
lar. Their trees will probably grow-
just as well without it.
Grades Also Plant Trees.
The grades each planted a tree and
also some vines were planted on each
side of the walk close to the large
entrance doors. A creeper w as plant
ed on the west side of th uuikimg.
About 15 or 20 thrifty cork elm trees
were planted. These in due time
should improve the appearance of
the campus and furnish shade.
Mr. Hughes is slowly recovering
and has had no more hemorrhages.
We hope he will be with us before

CAUSE OF EXCITEMENT
Other Items of More Than Passing In
terest From the EgK City.
A dog having every symptom of
being possessed of rabies, was dis-
atched by Marshal Frank at the west
end of Main street on Monday morn
ing. The animal had come into town
evidently from the country and had
been noticed to run the full length
of Main street. At the F. T. Calkins
place he was attacked by a couple of
Mr. Calkins' dogs and turned back
towards town, when he was met by
the marshal who had started to fol
low after him in an auto. It took
three shots from a rifle to kill the
dog. The Calkins dogs were both
bitten by the mad dog. According
to all reports there can be no doubt
that the dog was rabid and that no
persons were bitten by him on his run
down the street was a piece of good
fortune indeed. It has been later as
certained that this was J. A. Kiehn's
dog, and Mr. Kiehn states that sev
eral of his horses and mules were
bitten and he is expecting a lot of
trouble as a result. A dog belonging
to Wm. Gorger, a neighbor of Mr.
Keihns, also went mad and had to be
killed. This animal was acting
strangely for several days and ap
peared to be sick, and it was not
known what ailed him. Upon giving
him a shower of cold water in the
face he immediately went into fits
and evidence of bis mad condition
could not be disputed. The dog was
killed immediately. The Kiehn dog
had been afflicted for several days,
and just how much injury he In
flicted upon the stock remains to be
seen. No telling how far this disease
has already spread in this section,
and heroic measures will have to be
resorted to in order to stamp it out.
