in tin* Mouse tijilit over the prohibition
bill in 11*1". leading a hrillianl attack
on th<' enaltlintr ait on constitutional

was that the submission of the en

The enai'ltneiit of legislative prohihi
tion at tin* present session without
reference t,o or dependence upon the
, referendum of September 22. ni l. is
in a measure a concession on the part
of prohibitionists themselves to the
fear that the cons) itntionalit v of the
i prohibition law mi^ht be called into
1 quest ion, if it were made to hinge in
I any way upon the referendum.
in 1014 Mr While joined the prohibi
tion majority in voting for the en
aiding act. Since then lie lias become
! the central figure in the light against
| the establishment of a co-ordinate col
! lege for women at the t'ssiversll.x of

Senator lluchanau was emphatic in
expressing his belief that Jitneys
t should he required to pay a franchise
tax. "The laws of Virginia," he said,
! "impose this burden on street railways,
and I can see no difference between the
service temlered bv a Mr.-t-t rallwnv
and a jitney. Anil I would call the
attention of the Senate to the fact that
e\erv time a jitney fakes in cents
the State is the loser. The franchise
tax imposed on street railways is based
on their irross- icceipts. and. when thev
lose, the State also loses"
Senator Andrews asserted that anv
1 thing that would tend to decrease the
business of interurbau railways is pro
portionately harmful to the communi
ties through which thev operate, for
ilie reason that such lines never fail
to increase the values of adjoining
properties. The jitney, lie said, does
oot so effect properly, nor does it pro
vide transportation during inclement
wea t her.
