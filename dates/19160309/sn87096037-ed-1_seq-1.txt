Land Owners, Attention I
We desire to explain to you several reasons why we can
sell land and at the same time show you the tree benefits that
you receive by listing land with this company. There are no
secrets, the facts are plain.
Reason No. I. Every man connected with this Company
has had several years of experience and has been succcssful
in selling land.
No. 2. This company is reliable and we aim to make
our word, as well as our note, absolutely good, and are glad
to furnish bank references.
No. 3. We have been careful and have spared no ex
pense in perfecting a strong organization to bring buyers to
this part of North Dakota. We will have from 300 to 500
agents located in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, South Dakota,
Minnesota and Wisconsin, and everyone of these men have
a direct contract with this Company to giue their time and
attention to this work.
No. 4. In order to induce buyers to come to North Da
kota, we pay part of their railroad tare, whether they buy or
not, and also pay the agent's fare who accompanies them.
No. 5. We will have plenty of cars to show land.
No. 6. When we find a man who has to sell his Iowa or
Illinois farm before he bugs up here, we don't have to wait
tor him to sell it but will trade with him.
Surely, you can see in the above six reasons what a
splendid opportunity you have to tell by listing with us. Just
think of all of this service you are getting that don't cost you
one cent. We have to pay the bills, take all the chances, and
you stand no chance to loose.

STEELE COUNTY SCHOOL NEWS
It is to be regretted that all patrons
of rural schools could not have been
present at the Women's Division of
the Farmers' Short Course at Sharon
or Hope and have heard Miss Sulli
van's splendid talks and demonstra
tions of the rural school hot lunch.
This movement is gaining ascendancy
rapidly it is not an experiment for
it has proved itself. No argument is
necessary to con vience one that cpld
lunch eaten five days each week for
eight or twelve years will weaken the
constitution of the strongest child.
The hot noon lunch increases the phy
sical and mental efficiency of growing
boys and girls and it should find its
place in every rural school.
By hot lunch, we do not mean a
whole warm meal but simply one hot
dish served with whatever the dinner
pail contains. An enthusiastic teacher,
a small oil stove, a few simple kitchen
utinsils, a few provisions from the
various homes, and the hot lunch is
ready to be put into operation.
This hot lunch plan is being tried
with great success in several of our
rural schools. The following is an
enthusiastic report sent to us by Mist
Lillia Lund, of Willow Lake sohool,
number four. Their equipment con
sist* of a two burner oil stove loaned
by a neighbor during the cold months,
a few simple kitchen utinsels donated
by parents, a cupboard made from a
box by the boys, dishes (each pupil
brings his own) and canned goods
purohased by a tax of tan cents upoa
each pupil. Potatoes, milk, butter,
etc., are furnished in turn by the par
ents. Dish towels are also furnished
in this manner. One hot dish served
each day. One day it is hot chocolate
the next, cream potatoes then follow
in succession, tomatoe soup, beans,

rice, cream dried beef, corn, peas, etc.
The contributions each day are inex
pensive—a few potatoes, a quart of
milk, a hand full of rice, or a few
tablespoonfalls of butter which the
children bring in the morning.
Wherever this hot lunch plan has
been tried it has been a splendid suc
cess. The keen interest which pupils
take in it and the glow of satisfaction
on their faces at noon time will more
than repay the work to say nothing of
the comfort and health. It is a matter
which teachers cannot promote alone
it requires a hearty co-operation on
the part of the parents. The hot lunch
in your rural achool means a decided
step forward in the educational pro
cession. We heartily endorse this
plan and sincerely hope that it will
fine its way to every rural school in
this county.

The pupils take turns to prepare the
lunch and do the dishes. Very little
school time is needed for this. The
desks are set with dishes and the pu
pils eat while sitting down and not
while racing around the sohool room.
