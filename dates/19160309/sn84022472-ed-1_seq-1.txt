HAINES DEFENSE
RESTS; "INSANE"
SAY ALIENISTS
The defense rested in the Jason S.
Haines murder trial in the criminal
superior court at 12:30 this afternoon
and the state began to call witnesses
in rebuttal. County Sheriff Simeon
Pease was the first to take the stand.
He said he had several conversations
with Haines while the accused was in
jail. Haines did not display any ab
normal characteristics, the witness
said. The., prisoner was quiet, made
no trouble and indulged in no wild
talk.
Sheriff Pease said Haines had writ
ten a number of letters to August
Kuehri of Fairfield, a witness for the
defense. After Kuehn had talked with
the prisoner the sheriff asked him
what he thought of Haines and Kuehn
replied, "I don't think, he's crazy but
he's, a very foolish man.''
Jailer Matthew W. Scott was next
called. He declared he had never
seen Haines until the day he was
brought to the jail. He thought the
accused looked weather beaten then
and his clothes were soiled but other
wise 'his appearance was not different
than today. The witness claimed
Haines had made no outbreaks in jail
and had been a model prisoner.
William B. Wallace of Trumbull de
clared he met Haines and former
Deputy Sheriff Berger the day the
prisoner was being brought to jail.
Haines asked the witness some ques
tions about the team he was driving
and asked Wallace to take care of
the Haines children until something
could be done for them at their, own
home. There were no signs of mental
derangement about vHaines, Wallace
stated. r
The last witness for the defense was
Dr. Allen R. Diefendorf of New Ha
ven. He stuck to his statement on the
direct examination that he found
Haines medically insane on the day

NEGRO JUSTIFIED
IN KILLING, SAYS;
CORONER PliELAN
Finding Probably Will
, Prompt City Court to Dis
charge Marshall.

Portuguese Victim's Broth
er Here to Arrange For
His Funeral.
Coroner John J. Phelan finds that
Joseph Marshall shot in justifiable de
fense of his own life when he killed
Pedro Dias Monteria in the shack at
854 Iranistan avenue last Saturday
night. The coroner completed his
finding today and the result of his in
vestigation will undoubtedly be ac
cepted by the city court authorities as
reason for discharging Marshall from
custody when his case comes up on
Saturday morning. Marshall now is
held without bail on a charge of mur
der. The coroner finds that" Mrs. Viola
Diggs, who was engaged to marrv the
victim, had rented the house at 854
Iranistan avenue to Marshall, who was
her brother, and to Robert H. Valen
tine and several other negroes. They
were to pay a weekly rent of 75 cents
each.
In company with .Monteria Mrs.
Diggs visited the house on Saturday.
She had appointed Hickson to act as
her agent and collect the rents from
the other men. She did not find I
Hickson and after going with Mon- j
teria to a nearby saloon, where they I
had drinks, she returned to the house
with Monteria. She asked her brother j
for financial assistance in supporting :
the home of their mother in New Ha- I
ven, but the latter "refused and began J
j to abuse her, using Indecent language.
I The brother and sister came to blows, j
j At the same time Monteria seized a
i nickel plated lamp from the table and '
I began to beat Valentine on the head i
with it. - , ;
Mashall, attempted to separate the
men and to induce them to" desist. To
' his surprise Monteria turned on him,

; forced him into another room where
! he threw him across the bed. Hold
j ing the prostrate man by the throat
I with. the left hand Monteria threw
' away the lamp and reached for his hip
: pocket. Up to that time, Marshall f
claims, and his testimony has not been i
disputed by any of the witnesses, that J
. he was mecely endeavoring to keep
Monteria off him by holding him by
the shoulders.
Before the fight started he had been
; warned to "look out" for Monteria as
the latter was "a bad man" and "car
ried a gun." When Monteria reached
for his hip Marshall believed he was
i reaching for a revolver. He took his
: right hand from Monteria's shoulder,
' reached for his own hip pocket, where
he had a revolver, drew it and shot
Monteria dead. The bullet entered
Monteria's brain through the left eye
and death was instantaneous. Mrs.
Diggs and the other negroes had fled
from the house by this t'me. No pis

Columbus, N: M., March 9 Nine civilians and six
killed early today when 500 Villa bandits crossed the border and attacked this town.
Among the civilian dead and wounded are women and children. Eight troopers
were wounded in the pitched battle that followed the surprise attack by the bandits.
Before retreating under the fire of the army machine guns- the bandits fired
many buildings. Half of the town is in ashes, and there isn't a building standing that
was not hit many times during the battle.
United States Troopers Pursue Bandits.
United States troopers are in pursuit of the bandits, who fled after applying
the torch. "
Civilians were shot down by Mexican snipers who were posted at vantage point
when the attack on the railroad station, at 4:30 o'clock, announced the raid.
The railroad station was fired and the bandits immediately began a carnival of
pillage and destruction. They held the city for an hour and a half before the fire of
the United States troopers
A large number of Mexicans were
killed. Their bodies dotted streets
where they had been posted, picking
off Americans as they emerged pell
mell out of dwellings and hotels. Sev
eral guests are reported to have been
burned-to death in the Central Hotel,
whlah was one of the first buildings
fired by. Villa's men.
Mexican bandits standing outside
the flaming building shot down A. L.
Ritchie, proprietor of the hotel, . and
R. Walker, a guest, as they attempted
a aasn out or tne aoor. jsolii were
dead when picked up later. i
C. C. Miller, owner of a drug store,
was shot as he tried to enter the door
of the Hoove Hotel, an adobe struct
ure, protecting a score of cowering
women aid children, who remained in
the rooms while ai howling mob of
bandits surged through the surround
ing streets.
Although they first attacked the
camp of the Thirteenth cavalry, 11
suffered little although a number of
American soldiers were killed and
wounded and a number of cavalry
horses ridden off by the Mexicans as
they fled back toward Mexico after
daylight.
The attack was a complete sur
prise. Villa deceived all the authori
ties by dispatching a telegram to
Hachitaw, N. M., last night, saying
that he was at the Nogales ranch in
Chihuahua, near the border, at least
forty-four miles from here. , This
telegram was signed ostensibly by the
American caretaker of the ranch and
stated that Villa personally was at
the ranch house.
AH the while, however, the Mexi
can bandit leader was making his
way from Bosques Grande? Ranch,
about 25 miles southwest of here.
A Mexican scout gave an intimation
of this. He reported late last night
that hesaw two parties of Villa's
men moving eastward from Bosques
Grandez Ranch toward Palomas, an
abandoned Carranza outpost six miles
directly south below here.
Colonel H. J. Sloeum, commanding
the 13th cavalry, had heavy patrols

when Villa appeared in the vicinity
several days ago.
Lieut. Casteman, officer of the day,
turned out all the men remaining in
the camps. Shrieking battle yells the
Mericans in overwhelming numbers
rushed savagely into the town north
of the railroad tracks.
A courier was sent to Major Linsley
at Gibbons' ranch, 15 ' miles east, to
bring up the troops posted there. Th6
first volley of rifles awoke all the
townspeople.
Villa is said to have been' seen by
several Americans directing his men.
He cat the telegraph wires east to
El Paso to prevent any call for Amer
ican troops stationed there. The .tele
phones also went out of commission.
While part of his forces fought the
hastily rallied American troops. Villa
is said to have detailed snipers and
soldiers to various houses. Houses
throughout the town were riddled with
bullets.
A. L. Rlggs, wife and two children,
in the ' living quarters of the custom
house, barricaded themselves behind
mattresses on ithe oor. L. Jager, his
wire and f.mily were on the second
floor of the station building and did
the same (thing.
In the section ' hit nearby Foreman
S. S. McCullough and his wife and
their four children sought safety on
the floor. Bullets flew over their
heads. C. C. Miller was shot' dead
as he dashed from his drug store
to the Hoover hotel across the street.
A woman dragging a little girl by the
hand, was wounded and stumbled
over the druggist's 'body.
Snipers posted in front of frame
buildings which had been set on fire,
shot at the American inmates as they
sought refuge from flames fast de
stroying several buildings.
These Mexican snipers moved de
liberately in the dark. The lighting
of lamps by householders and hotel
guests startled out of sound sleep by
the rifle fusilade, promptly brought a
shower of bullets. .
Every house in town appeared to
have been hit from once to a doz
en times.
Civilians armed themselves at vant
age points within their homes and
answered the shots of the Mexicans.
Some of the bandits sought to entice
Americans out into the streets 'by
speaking English. J. S. Dean was
caught in this way. A Mexican, who
spoke excellent English, called to
him. Dean emerged from a doorway
and his reply in English betrayed
him to be an American and .brought
his death.
At the same time another American
shouted:
"Hey, who are you?"
"Vive Villa," came the reply.
"I don't know who he is," the Amer
ican answered, "but I fcave some of
him left here scattered in the street."
The American pointed to the street
intersection where half a dozen dead
bandits lay in the pale light of dawn.
The quick flash of a few pistol shots
were visible and disclosed dying forms
In the stret. Villa apparently left
when Col. Slocum's troops began
pressing the snipers toward the south.
Villa's buglers began sounding the
retreat shortly before 6 o'clock. The
town was cleared of them by 6:30 and
the remaining people of Columbus be
gan to take account of casualties and
losses. Walter Walker, who was shot
at the Central Hotel with the proprie
tor, W. T. Ritchie, was a delegate to
the New Mexico state convention'' of
Sunday schools. His body was burned
in the ruins of the hotel.

Shortly afterward oil was thrown

Major Frank Tomkins, with two

gate south of here, caught the re
treating Mexicans oin the flank and
