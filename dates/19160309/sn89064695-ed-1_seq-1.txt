Senator Curtis Assumes
Responsibility Of The
Morris Law.
At a hearing before the senate
Indian committee last week, Sen
ator Curtis assumed the responsi
bility for introducing the Morris
Act regarding which M. O. Burch
tried to create the impression be
fore the Graham committee was a
big scheme to defraud the Chip
pewas of their pins timber. Sen.
Curtis made the statement before
the committee that he had intro
duced the bill, wltich had been
prepared by the interior depart
ment, and by doing this the Min
nesota delegation in the House had
refused to speak to him for three
weeks that he had finally made a
compromise with Congressman
Morris, and that the latter had
from that time on assumed charge
of the bill until its passage by
Congress.
Mr. Burch did not only intimate
fraudulent motives on the part of
Judge Morris but also tried to
connect Senator Clapp with it.
Another of Burch's contentions,
by Sen. Curtis' statement, has
gone up into smoke, although
those who know Judge Morris did
not doubt his words in the least
when he made a statement before
the Graham committee in which he
did not hesitate to condemn
Burch.
DUNN SHOULD NOT TRY
AND MISLEAD.
The Minneapolis Journal in its
political column has the following
to say regarding the Daniels
charges and which it quotes from
the Princeton Union:
"Commenting on Sam Y. Gor
don's demand that C. C. Daniels
charges against Senator Clapp
shall be "sifted to the bottom,'*
B. C. Dunn says in the Princeton
Union:
If Mr. Gordon will peruse vol
umes one and two of the report of
the congressional committee on
the "Investigation of White Earth
Reservation," which he can easily
obtain by writing to the congress
man from his district, he will get
full ar complete infbrmation on
the subject. The volurans in ques
tion contain mighty interesting
reading.
The investigation referred to
was made by the so called Graham
committee of congress."
The Princeton Union should at
least be fair and refer to that por
tion of the Graham committee re
port which in any way involves
Sen. Clapp in anything that was*
not for the benefit of the Chippe
was of Minnesota.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
Ji*ye in their general council en
dowed Senator Clapp, and if he
had evr secured the passage of
sany legislation which was not to
iheir interest, they would not have
hesitated to condemn him.
The criticisms of Sen. Clapp are
001 in behalf of the Chippewas,
Isl t^^t
but on account of other interests
which his critics dare not come
out in the open and assume.

Chippewa Delegates In
dignant Over Daniels'
Interview.
Repudiate Statements Made Against
Senator Clapp.
The Chippewa delegation, some
of whom have just returned from
Washington, including those who
are still at the capitol, addressed a
communication to the Minneapolis
News in reply to the Daniels' in
terview which appeared in that
paper on the 25th of last month,
and which the News abreviates as
follows:
"Daniels' Charges in a Nut
shell."
"That Senator Clapp sent a pe
tition to President Wilson for the
removal of Mr. Daniels and Indian
Agent Howard that was signed by
employes of the NicholsChisolm
Lumber Company."
That Simon Michelet and E. E.
Smith have formed a company for
the purpose of buying land from
the Indians."
"That the full Wooded Chippe
was have not been represented be
fore the Congressional Indian com
mittee of the last two congresses."
"That the recognized represen
tatives of the Chippewa Indians at
Washington are representatives of
the "White Man's Council."
"That at least two of the repre
sentatives are employes of the
NicholsChisolm Lumber Com-
pany."
"That the full blood Chippewas
are actually dyir.g off from starva-
tion."
Mr. Daniels charges in substance
that Senator Clapp, the Depart
ment of Justice under the Demo
cratic administration, E. E. Smith
and Simon Michelet, prominent
Republicans of Minneapolis, and
the NicholsChisolm Lumber
Company entered into a combina
tioo to cause his removal.
List fall ex State Senator The
dan informed the publisher of THE
TOMAHAWK that Mr. Daniels had
seated to him that ex-Gov. Eber
-vrt E. E. Smith and Simon
Michelet had entered into a scheme
to defraud the Chippewas of this
reservation out of their lands, and
Daniels then stated that he was so
going to inform Senator Clapp.
Now he says it is Sen. Clanp who
has beeu used as a tool of the per
sons who wish to defraud the In
dians.
According to Daniels not only
is Senator Clapp, ex-Gov. Kber
hart, E. E Smith, Simon Michelet
and the NicholsChisolm Lumber
Company dishonest, but also the
Department of Justice under the
adminiotration that gave him a
position he was unable to fill.
The communication of the dele
giitions above referred to is as fol
lows and explains fully the POM
tion that the Chippewas are tak
ing relative to the fight now being
waged against Senator Clapp:

and by local councils of the sever
al Chippewa Reservations in the
State, have today read the inter
view with C. C. D-iniels, published
in the News under date of Febru
ary 25, 1916.
Mr. Daniels is the employe of
the Department of Justice, recent
ly removed from the position of
prosecutor in chief of the White
Earth allotment land suits. Much
of the interview attributed to bim
ib faUe and misleading, and we
most emphatically repudiate such
ports of the statement.
It is true that on July 10, 1915,
the officers, and some of the mem
bers of the White Earth Council,
together with the Vice-President
of the General Council of the
Minnesota Chippewas, sent a peti
tion to President WHSOD, asking
the appointment of a Commission
to visit the White Earth Reserva
tion and investigate Mr. Daniels
and Supt John R. Howard.
The following request affecting
Mr. Daniels and his relations to
and conduct among the Indians
was made:
"That the acts of the officials
who are creating and encouraging
ill feeling among the Indians be
fully investigated, in order to
learn the motive."
Instead of a Commission to make
investigation, Inspector Xearful,
of the Department of Justice, and
Inspector Tray lor, of the Depart
ment of the Interior, came to
Minnesota and made the investiga
tion asked for by the Indians,
with the result that reports against
both Mr..Daniels atfd.Superintend
ent Howard were filed, aa we are
informed.
Senator Moses E Clapp, being
a member of the Senate Indian
Committee, the petition was for
warded through him, and to this
extent only was Senator Clapp
connected w'th the matter, so far
as we are aware.
We speak with assurance when
we say in regard to Senator Clapp
that he has the respect and confi
dence of the Chippewas of Minne
sota, with the possible exception
of a few so called "warehouses,"
who, to curry favur with Govern
ment officials, have bartered their
manhood and independence for
monthly supplies or rations from
the warehouse at the hands of
Superintendent Howard.
These "warehousers" no doubt,
are the Indians to whom Mr. Dan
iels in his interview refers as "full
bloods" who are actually being
starved out and slowly but surely
being deprived of their rights to
live and enjoy protection.
If you will take the trouble to
inquire, you will find that in late
years these so-called full bloods
have been ignorantly signing any
thing and everything that was
placed before them by Govern
ment Officials in support of their
misrepresentations to the Govern
ment and the public.

tins communication it is necessary to

Indian Lid Opinion Asked
Of Lindbergh.
MANY IN THE MOVEMENT.
Bemidji, Minn.J. J, Opsahl.
candidate for Congress in the Sixth
district, has written a letter to
Congressman Lindbergh asking
him for more detailed information
regarding the latter's attitude on
the Indian lid question.
Mr Opsahl wants to know if
Congressman Lindbergh has been
correctly quoted in widely spread
reports to the effect that the en
forcement of the Indian treaty of
1855 is unjust and working great
injury to a large section of the
state.
Mr. Opsahl takes the position
that if the officials of the state had
performed their duty it would not
have been necessary to enforce the
treaty, and he asks Congressman
Lindbergh whether he does not
agree with that view. Another
question the congressman is ex
pectpd to answer is whether thedp
velopment of this section depends
upon the sale of liquor. In his
letter Mr. Opsahl calls attention
to the fact that two years ago sev
eral hundred persons signed a pe
tition asking that the treaty be en
forced.
A canvass of this section to learn
the real sentiment of business and
professional men shows that not
only is the resentment against fed
ejpal interference-growing rapidly,
but that many persons in favor of
prohibition are joining the move-
I Come in and look
over our line of
C/
ftM1
ment to induce Congress to re
lieve the so'called Indian lid terri
tory from the blight which the
federal government, through the
Indian bureau, has cast upon a
large area of Northern Minnesota.
This movement has spread to every
town and village affected by the
treaty.
An interesting development of
this general movement to have the
lid removed is the outspoken dec
laration of many influential men
that it will be necessary to elect to
Congress a man who will properly
present the matter to Congress,
explain the sentiment as it exists
today, and urge immediate rem
edial action. As it is not known
whether Congressman Lindbergh
will seek re-election, or whether
he is sincere in his recently ex
pressed attitude on the enforce
ment of the treaty, the candidacy
of Clarence Buckman of Little
Falls is receiving marked impetus,
for it is generally understood that
he is strongly opposed to the en
forcement of the treaty.Minne
