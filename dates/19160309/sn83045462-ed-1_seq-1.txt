"Killing of Americans was just because

PLOT BY VILLA IS SEEN
Belief Expressed That Outrage Was
Planned for Deliberate Purpose
of Provoking American
Action.
Faced by a new crisis in Mexican
affairs by the Columbus massacre.
administration officials admitted
that President Wilson
might find it difficult to refrain
longer from actual interference.
What the administration leaders
who favor a "watchful waiting"
course fear most is an outbreak
in Congress, with its consequent
effect upon the country.
The Senate particularly, which
contains many vigorous critics of
the administration's Mexican policy,
has iust settled down from
the flurry over the Cusi massacre
of several weeks ago.
Edict From White House.
At the White House the only word
eriven out was that stens woulrl
taken to punish the Villa bandits, but
it was not indicated whether Gen. Carranza
would be called upon to do so or
whether American troops would be sent
over the line.
At th" State Department it was said
that the situation was "very serious,"
but that no announcement of what action
could be taken would be announced
until the official investigation was concluded.
Memorandum to Carranza.
The State Department is understood
to have begun the draft of a memorandum
t?? (Jen. Carranza based on the
report of (Jen. Funston.
The memorandum is being prepared
\v;;h a view to its dispatch in case Secretary
Lansing decides to present the
case to Gen. Carranza.
it probaby will be drafted along lines
similar to the communication sent Carranza
on the Santa Vsobel massacre,
but because of the more serious aspects
of the present incident probably will
be firmer than the previous one.
President Eager for News.
The President sent word to the War
Department that he should be notified
immediately of all developments.
.Reports that American soldiers had
crossed the border in pursuit of the
Mexicans were shown him. The conviction
prevails in official circles that
the attack was a bold stroke 011 the
part of Villa to force intervention by
the United States.
Secretary Baker transmitted to President
Wilson reports about the attack on
Polumbus as quickly as they were received
at the War Department. It was
said at the White House that vigorous
stops would be taken to mmUh
bandits. The President directed Secretary
Baker to do everything possible
to protect Americans.
Hard Blow to Carranza.
While the policy of the administration
so far has been to look to the Carranza
I forces to deal with the bandits, some
' officials declared today that it was a
grave question whether such a raid as
I that on Columbus was not sufficient
evidence of the inability of the Car'
ran/a government to deal with the sit|
uation to warrant sending American
| troops over tlie line.
The raid started a new agitation in
Congress, where those who have opposed
the administration's Mexican policy
openly charged that the attack was
proof of i lieir repeated declarations
that t lie Carranza government ivas impotent
to deal with the situation, and
a fulfillment of their predictions that
another outrage iike tlie recent Cusi
massacre, in which sixteen or more
Americans were killed by Villa bandits
when they held up a train, was only a
question of time. There were indications
early today that the Columbus
massacre undoubtedly would be the
signal for another outbreak in the
Senate, where the opponents of the

Accusation Made in Ger
I
man Memorandum.
Vigorously challenging every
substantial charge against Great ]
Britain obtained in the German
memorandum submitted to Secretary
Lansing yesterday by Count
von Bernstorff. the British embassy
today issued a statement
which, in substance, makes it ap1
pear, first, that although Germany
asserts that her submarine war- !
fare was in retaliation for British
violations of international law, '
many of the German transgres- j
sions were committeed long be- 1
lore the British had issued the '
orders in council or committed '
any other act w hich even the Ger- '
mans alleged was in violation of
law. ,
i 1
j Also h is shown that one of r
the reasons the British refused to J
accept the declaration of London a
regarding maritime warfare was f
because the Germans had insisted ?
i
upon having embodied a provision v
in the declaration that would
have recognized the right of an J
enemy to prevent the civilian 1
population of a country from re- r
ceiving food which was to be jf
treated as contraband. r
a
The British Statement. ,
The British statement issued today \
is as follows: r
"According to the German statement, S
German submarine warfare was en- 1
lorcea on reoruarj i?, 191a, as an act t
of reprisal against illegal acts of Great 1
Britain. \
'The Admiral Oanteayme, with 2,000 t
unarmed refugees on board, mostly a
women and children, was torpedoed
and sunk by a German submarine on 1
October 26. 1914. Two British merchant t
vessels weic iui ^cuucu wiuioui nonce
on January 30, and the British hospital
ship Asturfas fired at with a torpedo
on February 1.
"The illegal acts complained of are
apparently the non-acceptance of the
London convention of 1901). the enlargement
of the list of contraband,
theh warning to merchantmen! as to
mines in the North sea and the capture
of the Wilhelmlna with foodstuffs
on February 9.
"The declaration of London of 1909
was never ratified by the British government,
and was never binding on
them. One of the reasons of the nonratification
of the convention was the
claim of the German government as to
the right to treat foodstuffs as contraband.
"The enlargement of the list of contraband
is an acknowledged belligerent
right; the warning to merchant ves- t
sels in November was due to the fact ..
that the. Germans had sown mines in
the high seas, resulting in the destruc- c
tion of many innocent merchant ves- v
sels. foreign as well as British. The
Wilhelmina. with a cargo of foodstuffs '
for Hamburg, was only stopped after c
the German cruisers had destroyed the *
Dutch vesjsel Maria (September, 1914) ?
and the Frye (January, 1915). which t
were conveying grain from California <
to Ireland." I

Theodore Roosevelt, who is now

and say that it would be a mistake

'"This is one of those rare times which
come only at long intervals in a nation's
history, when the action taken
determines the life of the generations
that follow. Such times were those
from 1776 to 17S9, in the days of Washington,
and from 1858 to 1865, in the
days of Lincoln.
"It is for us of today to grapple with
the tremendous national and international
problems of our own hour in the
spirit and with the ability shown by
those who upheld the hands of Washington
and Lincoln.
"Whether we do or do not accomplish
this feat will largely depend on
the action taken at the republican and

"I believe that in a crisis so grave it
is impossible too greatly to magnify
the needs of the country, or too strongly
to dwell on the necessity of minimizing
and subordinating* the desires of

the mighty tasks of the next four
years. That administration can do an
incalculable amount to make or mar
our country's future.
The men chosen to decide such a
question ought not to be politicians j
of average type and parochial outlook.
Still less should they be politicians
controlled by sinister influences from
within or without. They should be the
very best men that can be found in
our country, whose one great mission (
should be to declare in unequivocal
terms for a program of clean-cut, ,
straight-out national Americanism, in
deeds not less than in words and in
internal and international matters '
alike, and to choose as a candidate a
man who will not merely stand for
such a program before election, but ]
will resolutely and in good faith put
it through if elected.
June "a Long- Way Off."
"June is a long way off. Many things
may occur betweeen now and then. It
is utterly impossible to say now with
any degree of certainty who should be
nominated at Chicago. The crying, the
vital need now is that the men who
next June assemble at Chicago from
the forty-eight states and mingle the
views of the entire country shall act
with the sane and lofty devotion to the
interest of our nationas as a whole which
was shown by the original continental
ongress. They should approach their
task unhampered by any pledge, except
to bring to its accomplishment g
