Mr. Wanuamaker asks that thi

Progressives suggest this solution, hi
says, in order to keep the negro voti

Mr. Kvans' letter in reply is as fol
lows:
"i have your letter of the 25th o:
February, concerning tbe oath re
quired of voters at Democratic prl

that the oath be changed so as t<
allow a voter to pledge himself onl;

entirely a function of the Democratic
