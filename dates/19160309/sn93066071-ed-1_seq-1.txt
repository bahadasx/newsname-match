hundred nml fifty people ui.ru turned
awny from the door on account of not
only the seating capacity of the build,
ing being exhausted but there was not

which time the prices will be US and 25
cents.
The play was splendid from begin
ning to end and was heartily enjoyed
by all who heard it. Those who had a
part in its production are certainly
entitled to a great deal of praise for
the creditable manner in which they
presented their various parts. Each
one played his role, most commendably
and the fact Unit a great many of those
who heard the first performance have
said that they would not miss seeing
it again, speak' in no uncertain degree
of the high favor in which the play was
received.
The receipts for the evening were
$108 40.

AUTO TURNS TURTLE
The family of K. A I'ugh, who re
side near Dilko, had a narrow escapo
fromdeathor at least being seriously
injured Sunday afternoon when the
new Studebaker car, wiilch they had
Just recently purchased, turned turtle
while going at a good rate of speed.
The car was pretty badly smashed up
but each Of the seven occupants escaped
with only n few minor bruises, which
is, nothing lets than miraculous.
The family were out driving and Tab
P'ugh was at the wheel. In going
down a grade at a good rate thn car
skidded into a deep rut and Tab at
tempted to steer It out again. In so
doing the car was upset and turnvd
completely over onco and a half again
finally landing facing almost in the
direction from which it was going.
When the machine turned turtle the
occupants were thrown clear o f it
which is undoubtedly the only reason
they escaped being killed. The steer
ing wheel, top, fenders and wind shield
were demolished.
The loss from damage to the car will
be a heavy one for Mr. Pugh and all
who know them will regret to hear of
their misfortune, but rejoice to know
that the family escaped Injury.
