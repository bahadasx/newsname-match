"OUTRAGE," SAYS McMASTER.
Scores Companies Quitting State.
Seeks Federal Aid. !
Columbia, March 4.?Insurance
Commissioner F. H. McMaster this <
i
afternoon addressed letters to Senator
Tillman and Representative Lever
asking them to have the United
State government investigate certain
fire insurance companies that are
withdrawing from South Carolina because
of the passage by the legislature
of the anti-compact bill. Mr.
McMaster says that the State is un
able to deal with this situation, but
"it does seem to .me that this is a
most outrageous condition, and one
that should not be permitted by the
federal government," said the commissioner.
>He says that he believes
these ocmpanies have entered into a
conspiracy to withdraw from the
State and to injure the peoplb of the
State by disturbing the business conditions.
The following letter was written
by Commissioner McMaster to Senator
Tillman and Representative
Lever at Washington:
McMaster's Letter.
"At the last session of the legislature
the Laney-Odom compact bill
was passed. < It. was signed by the
governor on the second and goes into
effect on March 22.
"This bill practically, in effect,
simply forbade the companies 'making
any compact or combinations
with other fire insurance companies,
associations or partnerships or to allow
their agents to enter into any
compact or combinations with other
companies, associations ot partnerships
for the purpose of governing
or controlling the rates charged for
fire insurance upon property in South
Carolina.'
"The bill practically put out of
business the Southeastern Underwrito
oar\r>i a ti rm hut left PAO.h COTTi
CIO liiravwuviuu) uub *v.? _
pany the right to make its own rates.
It permitted the companies to employ
a common agent for the inspection
of risks, advising as to defective
structures, etc. As you know, for
the past ten years the Southeastern
Underwriters' associatipn has dictated
the rates of fire insurance in South
Carolina wjthout practically any ability
by the State to control these
rates. The purpose of the LaneyOdom
bill was to provide for independent
action by the companies and
permit some competition in fire insurance
rates.
Alleges Conspiracy.
"From the public prints, information
received through telegrams to
the local agents and from other
sources, I am convinced that a large
number of companies have agreed to
withdraw bodily from the State, and
they are now doing so. I believe
that they have entered into a con
' * - -* ~ 4- Vl A
6p*racy to injure um ui mc i
State by disturbing in every
way possible business conditions;
depriving agents of means . of
livelihood and otherwise working
great injury and loss to the people.
"Of course, the State is wholly unable
to deal with corporations which
withdraw from the State and which
have their home offices in other
States.
"But it does seem to me that this
is a most outrageous condition and
one that should not be permitted by
the federal government.
"The companies have claimed that
they lost money in Sou tlK Carolina,
and yet the law, when it goes into
effect, will permit each company to
make its own rates by its Own experience,
numbers of them threaten /
and in a practical mass withdraw.
"Is there not some federal remedy?
It does seem to me that the federal
authorities should have the power to
investigate the matter and to put an
end to a condition which seems to
me to be ruthless and outrageous.
"I feel sure that you will leave no
stone unturned to do your best for
the people of South Carolina in the
present emergency.
''Asking that you take prompt action,
I am very truly,
"F. H. McMASTER,
"Insurance Commissioner."
Several more companies notified
their local agents today that they
were withdrawing from business in
South Carolina. It is believed here
that practically all of the big fire insurance
companies will withdraw
from the State.

After a full hearing, at

Columbia, March 3.?The Atlas

from South Carolina because of the
act driving the Southern Underwriters'
association out of the State. They

OVER 3,000 LIVES LOST. j
Tragedy of Cruiser La Provence One
of Greatest Ocean Disasters. I
Paris, March 3.?It was announced
at the French ministry of marine todaj*
that there were nearly 4,000 men *
on board the French auxiliary cruiser
La Provence when she was Sunk in
the Mediterranean on February 26.
It was stated that on board the
La Provence were the staff of the 3rd <
colonial infantry regiment, the 3rd ]
battalion, the 2nd company of the 1st <
battalion, the 2nd machine gun com- j
pany and one extra company, in all ,
nearly 4,000 men. ^ j
As the ministry of marine on Feb- 1
ruary.29 announced that the number s
of survivors of the La Provence dis- i
aster was estimated at 850, it is in- t
dicated by the foregoing dispatch that <
upwards of 3,130 lives were lost. i
The loss of more than 3,000 v lives t
in the sinking of the French auxiliary I
cruiser La Provence is the greatest
ocean disaster of modern times. Up ,
to the present the largest number of j
lives ever lost in one wreck was when ]
the White Star liner Titanic struck an \
iceberg off the New Foundland banks i
on April 14, 1912, and sank with a ]
death loss of 1,595. The rescued ]
numbered 743. <
The French ministry of marine had {
previously issued no statements as to the
number of persons on the La 1
Provence when she went down. *
Th$ vessel, however, when in the ^
trans-Atlantic service could carny 1,- 1
960 persons including the crew, and 1
it has been presumed that, as she ]
was transporting troops between ]
ports not far apart, she was carrying i
a number t>f men larger than her nor- (
mal capacity. J
The official statement of February ^
29 announcing the sinking of the La ^
Provence said:
"The French auxiliary cruiser
DitAtranna TT (an tft dlSt.in
X i V T CUV/U XX \UW vw ?
guish her from the French battleship
Provence,) engaged in transporting
troops to Saloniki, was sunk in the
Mediterranean on February 26. Two '
hundred and ninety-sixN survivors
have been brought to Malta, and 1
about 400 to Melos by French and
British patrol vessels summoned by
wireless.
"No signs of a submarine were noticed
before or after the sinking. La
Provence was armed wth five cannon
of 14 centimetres, two of 57 millimetres,
and four of 47 millimetres.
Among the other great sea disasters
in addition to the Titanic already
mentioned were:
The Cunard Line steamship Lusitania,
which was torpedoed by a German
submarine and sunk off the head
of Kinsale, Ireland, on May 7, 1915,
with the loss of 1,206 lives.
The burning of the excursion
^steamer General Slocum in the East
River, New York, June 15, 1904,
when nearly 1,000 persons met their
death.
The , French Line steamship La
Bourgogne, sunk in collision with the
steamship Crementshire, July 4,
1898, with the loss of 580 lives.
The1 Japanese liner Kioker Maru-,
sunk off the coast of Japan, Septem
ber 28, 1812, with the loss of 1,000
lives. / v
The Canadian Pacific vessel Empress

with the Danish collier Storstad in
the St. Lawrence River, May 29,

lives.

)ENMARK MAIL ROBBERY
S'EGRO* IS ARRESTED CHARGED
WITH CRIME.
Charles Johnson May Also Be Implicated
in Orangeburg Repot
Robbery.
The arrest by Sheriff S. G. Ray of
Charles Johnson, on a charge of robbing
the mails at Denmark, may result
in implicating Johnson in the
-obbery of the depot at Orangeburg
ind the attack on the night operator
;here. Sheriff Ray carried Johnson
:o Orangeburg Friday, and at the
same time brought back Mallie CurT
to serve a sentence in this coun:y,
Curry's appeal to the supreme
lourt resulting in the lower court beng
sustained. The following from
:he Orangeburg Evening News of
Saturday will be interesting:
The arrest of Jake Black, colored,
n connection with the Atlantic Coast
Line depot robbery and dastardly attack
upon Operator Carter on the
morning of January 7, has not only
placed the officers in what they believe
to be direct touch with this one
2ase, but it has turned up several
Dther interesting cases, in which
Black was either directly or indirectly
connected. A warrant has been
sworn out for Black and he will be
held pending a more thorougn investigation
concerning his connection
with the jlepot robbery. He has
not given any additional information
regarding himself since the first examination
yesterday morning. The
officers believe, however, that the negro
will volunteer some additional
information before he has been behind
the bars many days.
Besides getting behind the bars
himself, Black has a compatriot in
prison, Charles Johnson, colored,
charged with robbing the mails at
Denmark, and John Wilson, alias
Charles Burns, wanted in Marioif
county for housebreakingand larceny.
In the Charles Johnson case Black
gave ithe officers some information
yesterday which led to the arrest of |
that man. Black said that Johnson
was a pal of his when he hit Denmark,
and that he gave him a bit of
valuable information in regard to
robbing the mails. Johnson has been
employed at Denmark as a transfer
man,' having charge of transferring
mails and baggage at that station.
Black upon, one visit gave Johnson
some help, and while rendering this
assistance, he told Johnson how easy
it would be to make a haul with the
mail. .Black opened one or two
v '
sacks at that- time and took several
articles out. Johnson was at first
u a ctmattt vi /\1 rl on/1 o
LiilllU, Uul 110 61CW UU1U ouu uicu a,
job himself. ,
Wheh this information was given
the police, Chief Jennings got in
touch with Sheriff Ray,'of Bamberg,
and last night Sheriff Ray together
with Johnson, arrived in the city.
Sheriff Ray made a careful search in
Denmark before bringing Johnson
over and he found a number of articles
which the negro had taken
from the mail pouches. Among the
articles were a set of silver teaspoons
bearing 'the trade stamp of a Beaufort
dealer, there were a pair of
child's shoes, a lady's green silk underskirt
and several pieces of lady's
silk under garments. These were all
recovered as the result of information
given by Black, although Johnson
said Black knew nothing of the
haul in which they had been taken.
Black yesterday morning, admitted
that he was wanted in Marion
county where he had escaped with a
sentence of four years hanging over
his head. As the result of communication
with officials at Marion, Rural
Policeman Davis, of that county, arrived
in the city today to look the
negro over. Officer Davis was in the
police court this morning during the
trial cases, and while there he recognized
an offender going by the
name of Charles Burns, as a negro
wanted in Marion county on~ the
charge of housebreaking and larceny.
John Wilson is the negro's right
name, and he was considerably surprised
when he saw the Marion county
officer in court. Burns, as he
was known here, was up today on the
charge of vagrancy.
Sheriff Ray also came in for a
iouble duty trip upon his visit to
Drangeburg. He not only brought
Charles Johnson, of Djramark to this
city, but took a negro by the name of!
Mallie Curry back to Bamberg from
:his city to inter upon a sentence imposed
for stealing peas.
Curry was a student at one of the
jolored colleges in this city. He was
ried sometime ago on the charge of
itealing peas and sentenced to serve

OPENING OF HUGE BATTLE.

Verdun Struggle Started at Her bebois.?Germans

Paris, March 4.?The French official
eye-witness gives the following
description of the defense of HerfViraa
milfle tft t Vl O nnrth ftf
UCUUIO, till VV liiitvu wv W4AV
Fort Douaumont, where the great
battle of Verdun began 12 days ago:
"It was on February 21, at 7:20
o'clock in the morning that the Germans
began preparation for the attack.
They unloosed a formidable
artillery fire on the positions which
" &
they wshed to capture and shells of ,
all calibres fell like hail. It was a
veritable drum fire of an intensity
unknown till now. A zone 500 me- > : '
tres broad and a kilometre deep, for
example, was pounded in such fashion
that the earth was plowed up on
the entire superficial extent in* mathematical
fashion. Laerymosal shells < . %
and suffocating gas shells were also
employed to accentuate the moral effect.
However, despite this formidable
rain of projectiles the Germans
the first day succeeded only in entering
our first line of defense atlHerbebois
and taking a small support- '
ing work of the line. It was a
miserable result compared with the Q
.- /
mechanical effort and the human effort
which they had put forth against
our advanc 1 line of resistance. It
was then that my regiment was called
upon to counter attack and to try * j
to recapture the first line lost.
"At midnight accordingly on the* 'M
21st the men were in position and 'J
we were rather happy at having at r
the first moment of'our appearance 1 1
1 ?CO ni>iennai>a
Oil lUtJ uuuu laivcii vo \/iiovuctv
who seemed to be, very glad not to v
have to measure themselves against
us any further. Among these prisoners
was an officer who, having
trie& to escape, was killed by the
sentry who was charged with guarding
them. ,
"Our counter attack took place on 1
February 22 at 4:30 o'clock in the
morning, but after a moment the
Boches attacked again. No one had '
j the advantage in this affair. Then |
! during the day there was on both
sides an unfceasing struggle with
grenades. We no longer had^ any /
natural shelter. Herbebois is covered
with tree stumps, among which\ f
some large trees stand up. On a '
depth of 300 to 400 metres behind is
. ordinary undergrowth, byt the Ger!
mans had 'opened upon it a terrible'
! outpouring of projectiles and the
| wood at certain places was transfomed
into a clearing. It was necessary
to manoeuvre through this confusion
by climbing and crawling. It
was snowfng, and I leave you to imagine
the endurance which our men
showed in the circumstances.
"During the night of February 22
the Germans renewed their offensive.
/ ' *
A bombardment of amazing violence
and of mortal precision did not permit
them, however, to advance an 1
inch. When their infantry in turn ;i|
attempted to strike our njen made -i
| them suffer sanguinary losses. It rj
was still worse during the 23rd. Af\
ter having copiously rained shells on
our lines, the Germans sent against
us at least a battalion. This attack
excited to the highest degree the
valor of our menr. They sighted the
: Germans at -50 metres and under
| methodic volleys the latter fell, howling
in terrible fashion. It was a
veritable massacre.
"Our 75 millimetres on their side
had executed a curtain of fire, preventing
the enemy from retiring, and
very few of the assailants succeeded
in getting to the rear. That did not
prevent the Germans from attacking \

us once more uunng me aay out
without any better success.
"Four of our grenadiers, posted at
the entrance of a communication
trench, killed groups of the enem^ as
fast as they presented themselves.
They carried on this work for more
than 20, hours. Our troops manoeuvred
as during field practice.
They saw without a murmur their
comrades fall around them and they
continued their work as quietly as
at exercise.
