W II Lynch Visitor Slate Nor
mal School Springfield Mo Thats
the way his card reads but really Mr
Lynch hardly needs a card In any one
of tho 22 counties composing the south
west quarter of Missouri As his card
indicates Mr Lynch ravels in the in
terest of the Spiingficld Normal an
institution almost if not quite as
popular among the people us he is
Prof Lynch is one of the oldest
active school men in the state His
long cxperienceand the fact thathe has
kept right up with the march of prog
ress makes him an expert in school
mutters and a welcome visitor every
where He had some nice things to say
about our school lis equipment and
teaching force But listen He asked
why the Stars and Stripes were not
Moating over our handsome building
and we told him we didnt know We
did not tell him how much time and
how many pencils we had used up in
the cause and with no visible results
We ore guilty of gross neglect in this
matter of teaching patriotism in this
most practical and effective way
school board citizens teachers all
Lets get back to Prof Lynch Hts
subscription is the only one we ever re
fused He offered to pay for the paper
hut he subscribes to 120 papers ami we
know something about a mans limita
tions We know that out of the good
ness of his heart and because he loves
the newspaper boys that he is taking
a lot of papers that he dont even see
and we refuse to take advantage of his
good nature
