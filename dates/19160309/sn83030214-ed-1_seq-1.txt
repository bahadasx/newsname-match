GERMAN MARK DROPS
TO NEW LOW RECORD
Quoted at 72'2 for Four Bcr?
lin Suffering ? inancially.
The collapse of the (?ermin govern?
ment's plan to control srti'irially th?
foroigfl exchange?, recently reflected in
rene?ved weakness 1b sight drafts on :
Berlin, was followed yesterday I ? s
new low record for marks, which fell I
to a ?juoted price of 74.*?? rent?, that Is,
four marks would bring only that1
?mount, when normally they would
bring S?fJ cents.
Foreign exchange bankers and brok?
ers explained that yester.lay's decline
from the previous loxx- record of 1t%,
established on January 7, was effected
?n comparatively light offerings of
billa They ridiculed r'port, that there
had been any exceptionally larg? trans?
fera of credits from Berlin to ?w
York by wireles*. Al a matter of fact,
raest of the ?elling of marks from Ger- !
many has been conducted in this way, '
as control of the transatlantic cables
rests with Great Kritain.
Commenting on the failure of Ger?
many to "peg" the pnce of her ex
< hange, b* England ha-, done with ster?
ling, bankers thought this furnished
excellent evidence of 'he comparative
tmanciul condition of the two coun?
tries, despita the eptlmietic statement?
that have emanated from pra*Teutsaie
source:. When sight drafts on London
have dropped fractionally below ?1.76,
buying has appeared x-hich has brought
it back to that level or -lightly above.
Apparently the only reason that mark*r
have not gone lower ia that few bill?
have been offered.
Zimmermann &. Forsbay, in response
to y?Mterday'a decline in Uerlir. ex-'
change, offer?-d subscriptions to the
fourth Imperial German I per cent war

400,000 persons crossed the Atlantic between American and Euro?
pean ports as passengers last year. Figures assembled to-day in
the Bureau of Navigation show that 250,000 of them travelled on

Only 38000 of the passengers travelled first class. Two hundred
and seventy thousand went in the steerage.
Passengers carried by belligerent ships are divided as follows:
By Italian ships, 113,000; British. 89,000; French, 43,000; Rus?
