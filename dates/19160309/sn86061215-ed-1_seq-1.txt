Washington, D. C., March 8.—The
German government," in a memoran
dum handed today by Count von Bern
storff to Secretary Lansing, outlines
In detail its position in regard to ann

to Its decision to torpedo without
warning all armed merchantmen of
Its enemies, concedes that interna
tional law, as at present constituted,
makes no provision for the use of
submarines and expresses a willing
ness to operate its submarines in ac
cordance with international law pre
vailing prior to th,e war on the condi
tion that Great Britain does not vio
late the Bame laws.

as follows:

the former naval weapons and England
not to Interfere with the food supplies
