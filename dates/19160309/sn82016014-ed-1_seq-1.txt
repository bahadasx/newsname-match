Sixteen Americans were killed
by Villa bandits variously esti
mated from 500 to 1,000, in num
ber, who swooped down on this
town in the darkness early today
and were driven off only after
nearly two hours fighting with
oOO United States cavalrymen.
Thirty or forty Villistas were
killed or wounded, it is estimat
ed. Five American civilians and
eijfht soldiers were wounded.
Aroused from sleep by the
sudden onrush of the Mexicans,
firing into the stores and houses,
seven American troopers and
nine civilians, including one wo
man, were killed before the Vil
istas were finally driven across
the border three miles below Col

Rumors that several guests died in
the Commercial hotel when the Mex
icans applied the torch are not cred
ited, although tie ruins are being
carefully searched for traces of bodies.
Mrs. Gran, wife of James (lean, a
leading merchant, was shot down in
cold Mood beside her husband who
was also killed in defense of his home.
Only the desperate bravery of the
outnumbered American soldiers pre
vented a massacre greater than the
.slaughter of eighteen helpless Ameri
cans at Santa Ysabel, Mexico, Jan
uary 10 I 'ablo Lopez, who led the
Villistas in the Ysabel massacre, s
reported to have been with Villa in
the attack on Columbus today.
Three Americans Villa held prison
ers before the raid on Columbus, are
reported to have been hanged and
their bodies burned.
Entering Columbrs und ?r rover cf
darkness, protected by a ditch, the
Villistas suddenly dashed into the
he.irt of the town, shrieking war cries
and shooting into houses.
Suuads evidently detailed for the
purpose, threw oil on several build-,
ings and applied the torch. Snipers
picked off civilians as they left their
homes.
The firing grew into a pitched bat
tle as soon as the American soldiers
could gather for the attack.
Col. H. J. Slocum speedily brought
the Thirteenth cavalry into action and
shortly after 6 o'clock drove the raid
ers across the border.
Information that Francisco Villa
and his chief lieutenant, Pablo Lopez,
were in personal command of the
raid was given Colonel Slocum by a

declared that a fourth American,
whose name - he did not know, n.

Mexican informant said Villa attacked
with from N00 to l.OuO men and
machine gun platoon.
"Traveling north they crossed .he
boundary west of Columbus," said the
Mexican, "and entered town by a ditch
running past the cavalry camp. Vi'la
was in per onal charge and declared
he was going to kill every American
because the American government did
not treat him right. Villa declared
'arranza could not make peace in
Mexico. With Villa were Pablo Lo
pez. Martin Lopez, Col. Candelario
Sevantes, Col. Craz Chavez. Gen. Jcse
Fernandez and General Keltran."
The Mexican confirmed a report
previously sent by Carranza officials
that before leaving the Santa Ana dis
trict in western Chihuahua, Villa had
freely stated that he intended to force
intervention by the I'nited States by
raiding American territory and -tilling
everybody in sight.
The Mexican fugitive said that Villa
addressed his men yesterday just be
fore ordering an advance on Colum
bus croM)r? to the Mexican's ac
count Villa declared the watchword
would be "death to Americans" and
added that the killing of Americans
was ordered because citizens of the
L'nited States were responsible for the
wretched condition of Mexico.
' 'The United States intends to swal
low Mexico,' Villa shouted," said the
fugitive, "Let us do what we can to
make it stick in their throats."

500,000 TO SEND TO MEXICO
Murderous Raid On American Town Early This Morning
1 """ I I I I. IN ...... . I- -I .1 ,
BULLETIN!
Washington, March 9. The Mexican question broke out in
congress late today. Senator Fall of New Mexico announced
that he had prepared a resolution to authorize recruiting of an
army of 500,000 to intervene in Mexico and aid the existing
authorities in stamping out -brigandage while in the house Rep
resentative Mondell, Republican of Wyoming, started debate
with a speech attacking the administration's Mexican policy.
VILLA LED HIS MEN.
A dispatch from General Pershing forwarded to the war de
partment late today through General Funston states definitely
that the Mexican raiders were commanded by Villa, personally.
Washington, March 9. General Pershing in a report filed
late this afternoon, says: "Slocum reports by telephone and
asks me to repeat that Villa himself led the charge through
camp with a force estimated at from 500 to 1,000 men. Eleven
Mxicans were killed in camp and 23 altogether so far."
MOVE TO TOPEKA
....
Secret Conference Discloses
Hock Island Plan.
Make This City Secondary Gen
eral Headquarters.
Following a conference of officials
of the Rock Island Lines in Topeka
the first of the week it is known in
railway circles today that a plan is
on foot to make Topeka next in im
portance to Chicago in general office
authority. The conference gave birtl
to a proposition whereby many gen
eral offices of the railway may be
concentrated here before June.
If the plan meets with general ap
proval from the officials with direct
ing authority, the Rock Island will
construct a new building in this city
to be occupied exclusively by offices
moved here fro.a other points on the
system.
The argument brought out at tho
Topeka conference was to the effect
that Topeka was the natural govttfn
ing center of the western and cen7fil
districts of the Rock Island Liuis.
Chicago, now the head of all Rock
Island authority, is far away from the
western terminals in Denver and Kl
Paso and Galveston. Many offices
could be conducted here with greater
efficiency and at less expense, it was
pointed out.
I "ill Up the Vacancy.
Kver since the Rock Island moved
the office of general manager and
subsidiary offices from this city sev
eral months ago. promises have been
made Topeka that something would be
sent here as a "fitting substitute."'
Rumors directly from Chicago in
the last week state that the account
ant's force would be moved 'o this
city. Indications recently have point
ed to this move. The secret confer
ence in Topeka early in the week,
however, brought out still another
chance for additional offices.
It has been known for some time
i hat the offices of the Rock Tsland
in Chicago were a tremendous expense
to the road. High rentals, limited
space and long distance have combin
ed to make certain departments too
, expensive in the "Windy City." To
peka, a much smaller city, with
cheaper rentals and grounds and with
i every acessibility to the western dis
tricts of the road, forms an ideal to
'cation, according to the newly formn-
lated plan.
ALL ARE WARNED
Senator McCumber Withdraws
Merchantmen Resolution.
I Sea-Going Americans Now Un
j derstand Perils, He Says.
Washington, March 9. Senator Mc
j Cumber. Republican, of Xorth Da
kota, today withdrew his resolution
j to warn American citizens off armed
' ships, stating he thought that Ameri-
cans have been effectively warned and
1 that the pendency of his resolution
j might embarrass nepotiations.
"In view of the turn in our interna
; tional affair during the last 24 hours.-'
! said Senator McCumber, "I feel that
I sea going Americans have been as ef
fectively warned of their perils as
though either the McLemore or the
; Gore resolution had been adopted, and.
! considering that new proposals tend
ing toward an amicable settlement of
the question in controversy, I feel that
reopening of the discussion might be
embarrassing and improper."
APPROVE RATES
Grants Freight Increase for Grain and
Coal.
Washington, March 9. Proposals
of western railroads to increase from
30,000 to 40,000 pounds the minimum
carload weight on grain products and
from 40,000 to 50,000 the minimum
weight on wheat and rye were ap
proved as justified today by the inter
state commerce commission.
The commission also found justified
increased rates on bituminous coal
from Illinois mines and other points
to points west of the Mississippi. Pro
posed increases on broom corn from
Kansas and Oklahoma points to points j
in Colorado and New Mexico were
found not justified and increases on
wheat and corn between points in
Arkansas on the St. Lrouis & San Fran
cisco railway to Memphis were found
justified.
MORE OUTRAGES
Three Ranchers Hung and
Bodies Burned by Villa.
E Paso Chauffeur Dead, Carl

Columbus, March 9. Arthur Mc
Kinney, foreman of the I'aloraas
ranch, Will. Corbett and .lames O'Jfeal,
captured by Villa Tuesday were
hanced and their bodies burned, ac
cording to information today. The
hanging occurred when the bandits
raided the cattle herd of the Bosques
Cardes ranch. J. J. Moore, a mer
chant, on a ranch one mile west, was
killed.
A chauffeur driving an automobile
with an El Paso license, name un
known, was Killed and his body
burned.
SIGHT WAR FLEET
German Squadron Includes Bat
tleships and Zeppelins.
Report It Is in North Sea Con
firmed by Many.
Ijondo.i, March 9. Morning news
papers publish from their correspond
ents in Holland such details as are
aviilable there regarding the recent
activity of the German fleet in the
North sea According to these ac
counts the fleet included about fifty
craft of all descriptions, from the
most modern dreadnaughts down to
old fashioned torpedo boats.
The fleet was escorted by two Zep
pelins, which served as scouts to pre
vent a surprise attack by hostile ves
sels. One trawler sighted this fleet
165 miles due west of the mouth of
the Kibe. Another saw it 35 miles
northwest of Yumiden. All the Ger
man ships were painted a war gray
and were invisible at a short distance.
Heavy clouds f smoke frequently hid
them completely.
One Dutch trawler is quoted as
having made the following report:
"During the recent air raid on Eng
land a Zeppelin was seen scouting in
advance of three cruisers and a fleet
of destroyers and submarines which
were believed to have the intention of
making a dash for Knglish waters.
The Zeppelin, however, made eertain
discoveries regarding the watchfulness
of the British fleet and the German
squadron hastily withdrew."
STATE APHEAIS CASE
Suits Aguins Klk- and Katies to the
Supreme Court.
Appeals in suits against the Kagies
and Klks lodges in Montgomery coun
ty were filed today before the state
supreme court by S. M. Brewster, at
torney general. Efforts to secure in
junctions against the lodges failed
when the cases were tried before th?
Montgomery county district court and
the state has appealed its cases to the
supreme court.
Two Eagles lodges and two Elks
lodges in Caney. Midland and Inde
pendence were under fire by the at
torney general's office. Both the
Eagles and Elks lodges in Caney were
cited by the state in suits for injunc
tions. The Eagles lodge in Midland
and the Elks lodge in Independence
were also charged with violation of the
liquor law. In all of the four casey
it was charged by the state that com
mon drinking was permitted in the
club rooms and permanent injunctions
were asked.
When the case was tried before
Judge Flannelley, the evidence wa
held to be insufficient and judgments
were entered for the defendants. The
state, however, contended that the
law had been violated and today took
the cases before the state supremo
court.
DIAZ IN HIDING?
Washington, March 9. State de
partment agents have information that
Felix Diaz, the Mexican revolutionary
leader, is hiding in New Orleans, and
upon their information they are satis
fied that he has not landed in Mexico
with an armed expedition as has been

Washington, March 9. Faced by a
new crisis in Mexican affairs by the
Columbus massacre, administration
! officials admitted that President Wil
, son might find it difficult to refrain
longer from actual interference,
j What administration leaders who fa
! vor a watchful waiting course fear
most is an outbreak in congress with
' its consequent effect upon the coun
i try. The senate, particularly, which
1 eontains many vigorous critics of the
president's Mexican policy, has just
j settled down from the flurry over the
C lift massacre of several weeks ago.
At the- White House the only word
I given out was that steps would be
taken to punish the Villa bandits, but
it was not indicated whether General
Carranza would be called upon to do
so, or whether American troops would
be sent over the line.
Lansing to Carranza.
The memorandum is being prepared
with a view to its dispatch in case
Secretary Lansing decided to present
the case to General Carranza. It
probably will be drafted along lines
similar to the communication sent
Carranza on the Santa Ysabel massa
cre, but because of the more serious
aspect of the present incident prob
ably will be firmer than the previous
Washington, March 9. First re
ports of the Mexican raid on Colum
bus. N. M., were received at the White
House while President Wilson was
having his first conference with New
ton D. Baker, the new secretary of
war. Officials admitted that the "raid
put a very serious aspect on the Mex
ican situation.
While the policy of the administra
tion so far has been t look to the
Carranza forces to deal with the ban
dits, some officials declared today that
it was a grave question whether such a
raid as that on Columbu., was not. suf
ficient evidence of the inability of '.e
! Carranza government to deal with Ine
j situation to warrant sending Ameri
i can troops over the line.
New Agitation.
1 The raid started a new agitation in
congress, where those who have op
posed the administration's Mexican
policy openly charged that the at
tacks were proof of their repeated
( declarations that the Carranza gov
! ernment was impotent to deal with the
j Situation and a fulfillment of their
! predictions that another outrage like
! the recent Cusi massacre in which six-
teen or more Americans were killed by
Villa bandits when they held up a
train, was only a question of time.
Swears in Baker at Once.
After the president and Mr. Backer
I had discusse i the reports briefly, the
president decided that the new sec
: retary of war should take office at
; ence. He signed the commission and
Mr. Baker went to be sworn in.
One of the probable courses most
discussed in official circles was to send
I American troops over the line to clean
cut the bandits.
It was pointeJ out that such action
could be taken with a declaration tbai
' there was no intention to impa;i the
! sovereignty of Mexico or purpose -if
occupation of territory, but simply to
j deal with a situation menacing to the
American border over which the Car
ranza governm -nt evidently had no
control.
Can Troopers Cross?
There is some conflict of opinion re
i gardin the authority of the war de
partment to send troops into a or
I eiiin country without Lhe consent of
' congress. Those who doubt the au
thority contended that ail Amiican
troopers may Jo without further au
thority would be to repel Mexican
marauders by fire. Jther officials,
however, contend that the constitution
vests the president with authority to
: epel invasion and that authority Lhey
say includes lhe power to send trot-pa
over the line. They point out that
:n 187 7 Secretary McCrary of ihe war
department instructed General Oi d,
commanding on the border, to notify
the Mexican authorities if they were
1 unable to suppress disorders which
menace the American side, the United
States would undertake the work, even
if the outcome caused the occasional
crossing of the line by American
I troops.
