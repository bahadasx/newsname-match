TABERNACLE MEETINGS
Will Commence Sunday Morning at
the Big Tabernacle Being Built
on North Church Street.
For some time plans have been
talked of for a big union tabernacle
meeting and they suddenly material
ized, the result being that on Mon
day morning a big force of men com
menced work erecting a tabernacle
building on the lots owned by J. T.
Harris on north Church street. It
was decided to build a tabernacle as
there was no church in Leon large
enough to seat the people at a real
union meeting, and the tabernacle is
promised to be ready for occupancy
lor the opening meeting on next Sun
day.
It will be something new in the
way of a revival meeting too, for it
will be in charge of ihe Business
men's Gospel Team of Fairfield,
Iowa, which is composed of leading
business and professional men of that
city, composed of eighteen men, and
during the meetings they will all at
tend the meetings, relieving each
other from time to time, but some of
them will be here all the time. This
team has just closed a big meeting at
Washington, Iowa, with about 400
conversions. Balloons and aero
planes will be used to advertise the
meetings.
The president of the Fairfield Gos
pel Team, Mr. C. W. Wade, is the
biggest merchant in Fairfield. A. K.
Harper, of the Harper Brush Works,
known as "Uncle John," who has
saved $30,000 since his conversion,
is knowoi by some Leon people, hav
ing frequently visited this city and
has owned several farms near Leon.
Gust Scott, "The Big Swede," will
have charge of the singing and ex
pects to have a choir of 200 voices
for the meetings.
The meetings will be participated
in by all the churches of Leon. The
slogan "Leon Leads for Christ," has
been adopted and they are going to
make it mean what it says.
The first meeting will be held in
the tabernacle on next Sunday morn
ing at 11 o'clock, an afternoon meet
ing will be held at 2:30 o'clock, and
the evening meeting at 7:30.
Who Started This Hot Air Story?
The past week the report has been
induustriously circulated in various
parts of the county that Walter Os
born, our popular and efficient coun
ty auditor, would not be a candidate
for a second term. There was abso
lutely no-foundation for such a re
port. Mr. Osborn's announcement as
a candidate for his second term ap
pears in this issue of The Reporter.
Walter has made a competent, cour
teous and obliging county official and
we will miss our guess badly if the
voters of Decatur county do not e
turn him to the office by even a larg
er majority than he had two years
ago.

A LARGE CITY CAUCUS
A. M. Pryor the Nominee for Mayor,
Floyd Coiad and Geo. farquhar
for Councilmen at Large.
The court room was packed last
Monday evening at the caucus called
to nominate candidates for city offlc-'
ers at the coming city election. Dr.
B. L. Eiker was chosen as chairman,
Floyd Cozad and W. A. Poush, as
secretaries, and S. G. Mitchell, Wal
ter Osborn, Ed Farquhar and J. S.
Parrish as tellers.
A. M. Pryor was nominated for
mayor on the 4th formal ballot, the
contest being between Mr. Pryor and
Morris Gardner, and it was a close
contest, they being tied on two bal
lots and only a few votes between
them on the others. Mayor Geo. R.
Farquhar absolutely declined to
serve as mayor again. On the infor
mal ballot, Pryor had 47, Morris
Gardner 47, F. A. Gardner 21, Far
quhar 16, and a number of scattering
votes. On the first formal ballot
Morris Gardner had 84, Pryor 77 and
F. A. Gardner 31. The second formal
ballot gave Pryor 95, Morris Gardner
93, F. A. Gardner 27. F.
There were two candidates for
councilmen at large to be nominated,
and on the informal ballot Floyd Co
zad had 62, E. G. Monroe 35, Geo. R.
Farquhar 34, S. E. Benefiel 28, F. S.
Stewart 26, Frank Gardner 21, Mor
ris Gardner 12, and many scattering
votes. Mr. Monroe refused to be con-J
sidered as a candidate, and on mo
tion Floyd Cozad and Geo. R. Far
quhar were nominated by acclama
tion.
For city treasurer M. A. Gammill
was nominated on the first ballot by
a vote of 74 to 35 for Chas. Cherring
ton.
For assessor T. E. Wallace was
nominated by acclamation.
A petition was circulated yester
day in behalf of Morris Gardner by a
number of friends, nominating him
for mayor, and it is probable that the
contest for mayor at the city elec
tion will be between Mr. Pryor and
Mr. Gardner.
Will "Leon Lead" in Cleanliness?
The busiftess men's committee re
quests me to call attention to the ad
visability of tidying up our streets
and grounds as much as weather con
ditions will permit in anticipation of
out of town vsitors the latter part of
this week.
If it is a fact that "Leon Leads,'.'
then l^t us act upon this request at
once, and continue to do it so that our
spring cleaning will be done by
springtime, "instead of waiting for
the mellowing effects of the good old
summer time.

ANOTHER GOLDEN WEDDING.
Mr. and Airs. J. K. Henderson, of Da
vis City, Celebrate This Covet
ed Anniversary.
We add another name to our list
of Decatur county residents who have
been married fifty years or more,
that of Mr. and Mrs. J. K. Hender
son, of Davis City, who were mar
ried in Decatur county on March 4,
1866, and they observed the anni
versary by having a big family din
ner at their home on Sunday, at
which nme ail of their seven children
together with twenty-eight grand and
great-grandchildren were assembled
at their home.
J. K. Henderson and Miss Clarissa
Starkey were married March 4, 1866,
and until five years ago had resided
continuously on their farm in Hamil
ton township. With advancing years
they retired from active work on the
farm about five years ago and moved
to Davis City to take life a little
easier. To them were born seven
children and all of them reside in this
county, Aaron, W. L., C. E. and
George Henderson and Mrs. Lydia
Hullinger, Mrs. Stella Stoneburner
and Mrs. Ida Fulton. This is a rec
ord which is hard to beat. Married
fifty years, resided fifty years in the
same county where they were mar
ried, the parents of seven children,
all living, married and residing in
the same county with their parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Henderson have a
large circle of friends in this county
who extend congratulations and trust
that they may be spared to enjoy the
comforts of old age for many years to
come.
Stole a March on Their Friends.
Mr. Robert Teale, of this city, and
Miss Helen Cook, of Rock Island, Il
linois, whose engagement was recent
ly announced, the date of the wed
ding being set for June 21st, stole a
march on their friends by getting
married at Des Moines last Wednes
day. Bob went to Rock Island a few
days previous and persuaded Miss
Cooto that it was the proper thing for
them to get married right away, so
they wired Mrs. Teale to meet them
in Des Moines and they were quietly
married, returning to Leon the fol
lowing day.
The bride is no stranger in this
city, having visited here during the
holidays, while she was a student at
the State University at Iowa City,
and it was while Mr. Teale was also
a student there that the romance
started, which has ended so happily.
The briae is a charming young lady,
who made her home with a brother
at Rock Island, Illinois. She is a
member of the Delta D^lta Delta
sorority, and was quite prominent in
social circles at Iowa City.
The groom is the only son of Mr.
and Mrs. Fred Teale, being born and
raised in this city, and there is no
more popular young man in Leon
than Bob Teaie. He holds a good po
sition in the Farmers & Traders State
Bank, and many friends in this city
extend their congratulations.
For the present and until a new
bungalow home can be built, they
will make their home with Mr. and
Mrs. Fred Teale.
Remember! When you place your
insurance business with E. B. Faust
Jnsurance Agency, you get the benefit
of the lowest rates and generous
treatment, and your insurance is in

Tremendous interest is being mani

opening Sunday, under the Business
Men's Gospel Team. Of course, nearly
every one has seen the ordinary
evangelistic meeting open but very
few Leon people have ever seen one
of these gospel teams open their cam
paign, to say nothing of going
through one of their meetings.
Bis crowds are anticipated at
these meetings on Sunday as people
are naturally curious to know just
how laymen handl^ such a thing.
These men are said to do away with
all stiffness and all that would sug
gest the formal or conventional. They
want everyone to feel at home wheth

is said they p.re of the good old fash

THE INTEIi-COUN'TY SPELLING
CONTEST.
Gladys Overholtzer Wins Third in
lnter-C«unty Spelling Contest.
Twenty-nine contestants partici
pated in the Inter-County spelling
contest at Chariton, March 4. The
counties represented were Lucas,
Clarke, Adams, Montgomery, Warren
and Decatur. Each county except De
catur was represented by five spell
ers. Gold, silver and bronze medals
were awarded to the best three spell
ers. They were given respectively to
May Brown, aged 16, of Clarke coun
ty, Elva Wilson, aged 13, of Lucas
county, and Gladys Overholtzer, aged
10 of Decatur county.
Decatur county's record in the con
test is one of which we may be proud.
We entered with four contestants
where others had five. Two of our
contestants were but ten years of age.
All of them spelled well. Finally
Wilina Cartwright tripped on 'gauge'
spelling the word 'gague.' Then Vir
gil Snow got excited over the l's and
p's in Philippine. He spelled the
word correctly but forgot to say,
"Capital P," and was called out in
accordance with the rules of the con
test. When the matQh had narrowed
down to live, Asa Barber and Glayds
Overholtzer were standing their
grounds valiantly. Asa was called
out several times, but was reinstated
by the judges who decided after brief
consultations with Webster that Asa
was a better speller than the man
who prepared the spelling list. But
being the subject of much controver
sy finally "rattled" Asa and when the
word miasma" was pronounced to
him it awakened no response. He
concluded he had never seen nor
heard of such a word and walked off
the field without making a tackle.
Then Gladys Overholtzer was call
ed upon to spell "acquisition." By
this time Gladys was sure .of the
bronze medal. Perhaps she conclud
ed this honor was acquisition enough
for a ten year old spelling against
older girls. At any rate she modest
ly dropped the "c" from acquisition
and the spelling match was over as
far as Decatur county was cencerned.
Mabel Welcher who stood third in
the county contest moved to Creston
during the interval between the con
tests. Her departure was unexpect
ed and there was no opportunity to
arrange for the proper person to fill,
her place.
An Interesting Court Decision.
When Harve Detrick of Washing
ton township refused to answer what
he considered pertinent questions
asked him by the census taker enum
erator, T. A. Patterson had him ar-
restea and bro ght before Justice
Morrow of Osceola. Upon the coun
sel of his attorney, O. M. Slaymaker,
Mr. Detrick plead not guilty." The
justice ruled that the charge was
well founded and fined the defendant.
$5 and costs in all $9.45 from which
an appeal was taken to the district
court. After a hearing last week
Judge Maxwell affirmed the decision
of Justice Morrow.
It is a case of more than ordinary
interest in that the authority of the
assessor and census enumerator is
frenquently questioned. It is rumor
ed that tne case will be appealed to
tue supreme court.—Osceola Senti
