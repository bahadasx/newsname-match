The Associated Cnarities and Hu

ben d3,-have gone on record as hearty
Hy favcrlr-s the proposed Baby -Week
for Honolulu. ''
i-Althcush he admitted he.knewbut
little about the local flans, Edgar. E.
Crocks, manager of the charities, taid
It would be very helpful if local work
ers would tpead an entire week in
structing mothers in the proper care
cf their Infants and small - children.
He added that he has heard of a like
project on the mainland, bat that he
preferred tomore'fally Investigate the
local plans 'before making a further
statement.' ' - ' . " -.-
Mrs. KR. nglav acting, sjeclal of
ficer of tte Humane Society,-declared
that the cutstandlng trouble seems to
be that mothers do not know howXq
take care of their children. r
''Son: e women are so Ignorant In
the matter that they are hardly, res
ponsive for the care cf their, child
ren," 6be continued. If some . of
these wenaea were enllshteaed. I do
net belleye. they. would treat their chil
dren as they da ' ' ; ' v "
"Tben, there are a great many moth
ers who cannot afford to give their
children, proper care, although; they
nay want to badly enough. , The Hu
mane Society might do .what little it
could tovrard3 advising what-should
be dene. But nearly always, when we
have cases of hahie3 or children, we
refer them to the- district nurses. ' -'
Mrs. Elgin added that the aim of
the society Is to see that children are
not neglected in their' homes; that
they are not starved or cruelly treat
ed. If they are, then the children are
taken from their homes and placed in
proper Institutions.
"I think , that the Idea of having a
Baby Week in Honolulu is an excel
lent cae," the concluded, ' ;

There is a possibility that American tcccps will be crdrrcd
to cross the border for the purpose of cleaning up the barJits,
which Carranza is evidently unable to do. It is rcacrtcd ti;at

actually quartered in the town, of Columbus, for it is the practise on the

of the command. The 13th is at peace strength and therefore at a maxi
mum of 65 men to a troop, making 195 in the three troops. .
