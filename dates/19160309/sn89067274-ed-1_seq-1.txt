Admitted.
London, March 8. Driving hard
against the French line northwest and
rsouthwest of Verdun, the Germans
have been enabled to make additional
gains toward Verdun but with ex
tremely heavy casualties, according
to Paris. Besides Hill No. 265, to the
southeast and a part of Forges, oc
cupied by the Germans through
strong infantry attacks preceded by
extremely heavy bombardments,, the
town of Fresnes, in the Woevre, also
has been captured, the French admit
The German attack was over the
entire front west of the Meuse, ex
tending from Bethincourt to the river,
but except in the Corbeaux wood and
at hill No. 265 the French held back
the attackers at all points. Thus toe
French stili occupy the important
strategic position on the heights of
the Cote de l'Oie, but the occupation
of a part of the Corbeaux Wood
would indicate that the Germans
have advanced more than three miles
since they took the town of Forges.
Infantry Attacks Increased.

George A. Brock, 87 years old, one
of the oldest and most popular men of

extended illness of diabetes. He be
came suddenly ill Sunday while eating
his dinner. He soon lost conscious
ness and remained unconscious to the
end.
Ho leaves his wife, Mrs. Belle

and three brothers and two sisters.
They are: Mrs. M. E. Daniel, Cen
tralis; Mrs. Adele Hunter, Chamois,
Mo.; Mathcw Brock, St. Aubert, Mo.;
and Lee and John Brock, of St Louis.
Mr. Brock was a native Tennessean
and came to Missouri in his early
manhood. He was in business in this
city for a number of .years and his
death will be mourned by many close
friends. The Ledger joins the people
of Mexico in extending sympathy to
the bereaved family.
The funeral of George Brock was

The burial was in the Catholic
cemetery. The pall bearers were: Joe

Dr. R. W. Bourne, of this city, was
96 years old Tuesday. Although he
has been ill this winter, the first time
really in his almost a century of life,
he arose early and shaved himself pre
paring as usual for the day. Dr. Bourn
enjoyed a quiet birthday dinner to
which only the immediate members of
the family were present He lives
with his daughter, Mrs. W. W. Fry, on
east Promenade Street
Tuesday was also the natal day of
Speaker Champ Clark and County
Clerk Ross Cauthorn. After break
fast Dr. Bourne sat down and wrote
Mr. Clark a letter wishing him many
returns of the day. Dr. Bourn, until
his recent illness, taught a Sunday
School Class of rtien at the Methodist
1 Church and was the oldest active Sun
day School teacher in the world.
In speaking of his long life Dr.
Bourn lays down the following rules:
1. Your chance of becoming a cen
tenarian is up to you. Begin by ap
plying common sense to your method
of living. '
2. Eat one third less than your
neighbor does, setting more vege
tables and cereals and less meat on the
table.
3. Drink water in copious drafts,
two small cups of coffee is enough
each day.
4. Do not smoke, chew or drink to
excess. Nicotine will aid you to reach
an early grave.
6. If yon are ill consult only a re
putable physician. Many a man's
chances for a 100 have been ruined
by unskilled treatment
6. Early to bed and early to rise is
an old but good maximum.
7. Exercise every chance you get;
activity keeps you young.
8. Live a Christian life and you will
be well repaid.
9. Don't worry over trifles. It will
help to age you.

Cincinnati, O., March 7. Charles

Times-Star, says under the caption
"Congressional Blunderers and the
Danger of War."
"The members of the House who
have advertised so widely their oppo
sition to the President's diplomatic
policies have argued that their efforts
were in the direction of preventing
war. As a matter of fact by weaken
ing the respect of foreign Govern
ments for the authority of the Gov
ernment at Washington, the influence
of their action could only be in the
direction of war.
"The American people do not want
war. But we are a patriotic people,
with a fair share of loyalty to the old
flag, and if it comes .to a showdown
most of us can be relied upon to back
up the President In whatever stand he
may take."

COURTESY "OVER THE PHONE"
IT's one thing to be courteous on
meeting persons on the street in our
place of business or in our home. It's
another matter, sometimes, to be cour
teous in talking over the telephone.
About the time you are hard at work
at your desk or in another part of
the house, the telephone rings. You've
got to stop and answer the phono.
And by the time you've taken down
the receiver for the 'steenth time in
the last half hour, you're in a frame
of mind to take someone's head off.
So much of the day's business is
done over the telephone that it is as
essential to be courteous then as in
meeting persons face to face. In the
advertising of a railroad ticket office
in Kansas City appears the phrase
"It's a pleasure to answer the phone,"
If the same were true of some other
business concerns .their trade a the
end of the month would take a decid
ed leap.
Courtesy pays!
