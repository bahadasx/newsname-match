FIFTY INCHES OF
SHOW 13 TOTAL
TO THIS DATE
iiA Inches In Present Storm
i-olloweLl byEig Blow
BUSINESS IS EADLY CRIPPLED
It Was Not the Biggest Snowfall of
the Winter But Is Causing More
Trouble to Travel.
Bennington started at cue o'clock
Wednesday afternoon sending up S. O.
S. signals. From one end of the
county to the other tne atmosphere
was choked with S. O. S. signals.
Finally a Washington street gentle
man started out determined to find
out what species of distress "S. O. S."
signified so far from the sea. When
he learned it was "Same Old Snow"
he met the ground with great sudden
ess and was carried home on a door.
. It is estimated that 14 inches of
snow has fallen in the last 2i hours,
bringing the total amount this winter
up to 50 inches. It is Bennington's
second big storm of tho winter which
record brings the amount fallen this
season to a figure surpassing the snow
fall of any winter since 1888. A queer
feature of today's blizzard is that it
falls so near the anniversary of the
famous storm of 28 years ago.
Tho prohibitionists are convinced
this nioruing that the Lord is disgust
ed with tho way the election went
Tuesday and the big fall of snow at
this time is an attempt on His part to
cover us with purity. But the prohi
bitionists had to shovel their way out
this morning the same as the rest of
tho census, through drifts that in
some places especially on the hill at
Old Bennington and to the south of
the village were piled five to six feet
in depth.-. ,', ,
, The snow would not have been so ob
noxious had the fall not been followed
by a high wind that blew almost con
tinuously through . the hours . of
the night and well into the
forenoon, burying milk men snow
plows and arguments . over the
Perry bill, result., On , .the , .cl
vslted sections "of the village, it was no
uncommon sight to see the snow .bank
ed, to iho sills of the first-story wiuaows
and roBMents tnrow.ng up. the material
from their walks on piles that hid them
from .'View. v . t' i
As usual, all trains were delayed and
the trolley cars had a, bard .tlniq-getting
through. SnoW-plows on' " both
F.tcam and trolley , rdada were ' doing
heroic duty alj night, in ppite ofiwhich
tlte sl6eper did not arrive in the villlge
until 7 o'clock tii morning. and,, .the
Troy train at nine o'clock had not put
out from the Troy station,
although at that time it was
nearly due in Bennington. The
New York and Boston papers were
therefore delayed and Bennington has
had but incomplete reports of
the effect of the storm in other sections
of the country.
On the street lines the North Adams
cars went out of commission early yes
terday afternoon and did not pet
through until 10 o'clock last night.
Thl3 delay was partly due to a brok
en car in Pownal which had nothing to
do with the storm, , This car delayed
traffic until it was pulled into North
Adams, but it gave tho storm a chance
tOTrlle Bnow on unused tracks and the,
bl plow had to get, ahead of tho regul
ar carS." The 10:45 car started "out of
the village crammed to capacity fund
although its progress was almost a
"hobble," it went through without
much seriotis delay. ; ;s
"The Hoosick Falls line ran nearly
on schedule last night and this morn
irigi" although" the motors on the phW
were at meltintr point. The line wa9
kept open and North Bennington folks
who work in the village reached their
labor but a few minutes late.
The kids knew when they looked
from the windows this morning that
there would be no "readin", rltin' and
'rithmef ic" today, but it was necessary
to use the telephone to verify Princi
pal Varney was on his job, as well as
the phone operations. The phone girls
were kept busy plugging information
through the switchboards, but the joy
of the kids was short-lived when they
learned that the school authorities had
announced the lost day would be made
up in the near future on a Saturday

There was practically very little
damage done by the storm, except the
depreciation on snow-shovels caused
by excessive and strenuous use. No
lines were reported brought down from
the telephone office and no farmers
were reported lost in the blizzard while
planting corn yesterday.
The milk-men were the worst suffer
ers and many of them made their
rounds this morning with an extra
horse. The snow was so deep in places
on Weeks street that one horse was
noted breaking his way through the
drifts with his noBe. This story isn't
horse-play, either. The animal was
perfectly willing to hit his mattress
when the owner finished his route and
reached his barn.
Bennington ia now fairly convinced
that winter is upon us. The man who
says he heard a robin Tuesday and the
fellow who came down from Woodford
with the story of picking a dandelion,
are busy this morning explaining that
they made the statements under tho
undue excitement caused by the direct
primary and the majority by which
Bennington went damp. There is hope
expressed in some quarters that tho
stuff cluttering up Main street may be
removed bya Providence in time for
at least one, day's wear of .ice cream
trousers and the chance to eat an ice
cream code assisted by a palm-leaf fan.
Spring has become a rumor, summer
an Ideal and green grass will be an
epoch. Meanwhile the sweetest mus
ic falling cn the Bennington ear is the
sound of a man's own voice as he says:
"Thank the Lord' I've got that job
done" and he spends the following hour
standing in JiIb parlor window gazing
on the shoveled walk that has called
forth the remark and guying tho man
who Is waiting, for his wife to volun
teer to do tho job, on the walk across
tho street.
The fifth week since Candlemas be
gan yesterday and it is going to take
only a few days more to prove the
ground hog a liar.

REVISED ELECTION FIGURES
Increase Majority Against Perry Act
and For Primary.
Rutland, March 9. The Herald this
morning prints the complete vote on
tho two state-wide referendums voted
on Tuesday, the Perry prohibition
measure and tho direct primary act.
The last town to be heard from was
the home of Marshall J. Hapgood
Peru which turned down the direct
primary by the overwhelming vote of
two to one and better. It should be
pointed out that the total vote on the
question in Peru was 38. Tho majori
ty by which the Perry act was snowed
under, given yesterday morning as
13.C56, has been increased by 71 by
the returns from Warren. Marsh field
and Barre city have jumped the ma
jority in favor of the direct primary
law. The Herald's figures this morn
ing, which have been carefully revis
ed, show that 25,856 votes were cast
for the direct primary that that tho
vote against the measure was 21,829,
making a majority of 4027 for the act
which becomes a law. The revised re
turns show that the Perry bill was de
feated by a majority of 13,673.

For eastern New York and western

NORTH SEA FIGHT NEAR?
. .Kaiserts Fleet of Twenty-Five Ships
; Said to Be Ready for Battle.
London, March - 8. Rumors n that
Prince Henry of Prussia, the kaiser's
brother, has been placed in command
of the German fleet for a dash into
the North sea were revived and re
eelved the greatest credence; . t I: hj.
An Amsterdam dispatch reported
that twenty-fire German warships
were sighted cruising in the North
sea. They wero ' moving westward
when first observed, but later changed
course and steamed northward, it was
stated.
Vague but persistent rumors re
garding the North sea war zone have
created a state of expectancy among
Londoners. This expectancy has
been- heightened by dispatches re
ceived from Scandinavia predicting
that a battle In which British and
Russian warships will oppose German
warships is not far distant.
KO REASON FOR IT '
When Bennington Citizens Show a
Way.
There can be no reason why any
reader of this who suffers the tor
tures of an aching back, the annoy
nnce of urinary disorders, the paluF
and dangers of kidney ills will fail to
heed tho word3 of a neighbor who
has found relief. Read what a Ben
nington citizen says:
Mrs. Celia Lamroeux, 222 Division
St., Bennington, says: "For four
years, I was so bad from kidney com
plaint that I could hardly do my house
work. I had a terrible backache and
headaches and sometimes became sc
dizzy that I was nearly blinded. The
kidney secretions wero unnatural and
caused annoyance. Seeing Doan'f
Kidney Pills recommended for such
troubles, I went to Cole's Drug Store
and got a box. They were just what
was needed. The backache that hail
clung to mo so long left and I fell
better and stronger. After taking
two boxes of Doan's Kidney Pills, all
symptoms of tho trouble were remov
ed." The above statement was given De
cember 19, 1905 and after OVER FIV1
YEARS LATER, Mrs. Lamroeux said:
"Time only increases my. confidence in
Doan's Kidney Pills. I still use them
occasionally, but never have any seri
ous kidney trouble, for they keep me
free from it.''
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the, same that
Mrs. Lamroeux has twice publicly
recommended. Foster-Milburn . Co.,

Another Verdun Fortress is Taken
By a Sudden Advance Under
Cover of Storm.
Berlin. March 9. Germany has de
clared war on Portugal' because of the
hostile act of Portugal in seizing Ger
man ships held in Portugese- harbor3.
The German ambassador at Lifcbon
today notified the Portugese : govern-
ment and demanded his passpcits.
London, March 8. A sudden Ger
man advance under cover of a storm
resulted last' night 'in 'the taking of
Fort Deveaux 'five jniles northwest of
Verdun.
Tho French lost several guns and a
number of prisoners, but their lines
held at other points and an effort is
being made to regain the lost fortress.
London, March 8. Through a vig
orous French counter attack in the
Bois de Corbeaux today, which, ex
cept for a fringe, Paris asserts has
been retaken, the German offensive
west of the Meuse has apparently
been slowed down. The French also
claim the repulse of violent attacks
on Bethincourt, the most advanced
point of their line, although east of
the Meuse the" loss of the Hardau
niont redoubt is admitted. ;

drive northwest of . Verdun i3 de

them to ? "flicerg anri 3,277
men. Tht . Forges and
Rogueville, Jerghts of Raben and
the Cumieres woods fell' into the
hands of the Germaua.. .
The French did, not give up these
positions without strong resistance
and suffered , heavy casualties, es
pecially along the' southern triage of
the Cumieres wood.,
': j ,T..f, 7, ', ,
' Washington, March S. Berlin to
day told President Wilson, that Ger
many, was willing to operate its sub--Tarinea
in accordance with interna
tional law prevailing prior ;i to the
war on condition that Great Britain
and her allies did not violate the same
lav.'. , '
The new proposal was contained
in a memorandum handed by Count
von Bernstorff to Secretary Lansing.
Aftor reviewing the events leading
up to Germany's recent decision to
treat armed merchant ships as aux
iliary cruisers, it conceded that exist
ing .international law does net regu
late the use of submarines. It ex
pressed the hope that the people of
the United States, remembering the
long, existing friendly relations be
tween the two nations, would appre
ciate the German position.
The niemorandum was submitted
to President Wilson soon after its re
ceipt. It will be considered, together
with other documents from the Ger
man government, in detorming' what
'hall be the next step of the United
States in the submarine negotiations.
There was every indication that
thp Administration would bo in no
hurry to' announce a stand as to the
new policy of the Central European
powers or to pass finally , upon Ger
many's latest proposal for a settle
ment of the Lusitania case. .

Early Wednesday Evening.
Charles Henry Sibley, aged 77, a
life-long resident of Bennington,
