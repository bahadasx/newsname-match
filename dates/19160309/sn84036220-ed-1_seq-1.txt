SO FLETCHER SAYS
Admiral Tells House Naval Committee
If the United States Wants a Navy
by 1925 That Will Equal Most Pow
erful Fleet Afloat Cost Will Run
Into Billions, and Says Judging by
the Great Wealth, This Country Can
Well Afford to Give Its Interests
Same Protection That Other Na
tions Think Necessary.
WASHINGTON, March 8. Approxl
matoly a billion amt u hair ilollura for
him ahiiis anti an annual upkeep
charge of $7611,000,(100, Is what Admiral
I'let idler, i iiiiiniuuilliiK the Atlantic
Oeei, cHliiuatPH it woul d coal to carry
out the navy general hoard'a recom
mendation (hat the American navy
nhimlil equal the nioat powerful Heel
ailiial by not Inter than 1926.
The admiral'a eatlmule waa given
today In toHtiinony before (the house
naval committee. Ilepreaeiltative Cal
laway, who brought out the atale
mini, called attention to publiHhnd
repoi'la that Great Britain hud added
nearly a million Iona to her light
ing alilpa since Hie war began. Ho
wan naked |f the situation waa not
"liopelosH." Admiral Fletcher (bought
not, adding that judging by Its great
wcallli, the United Slates could well
afford In give its Interesta the Hainn
protection Hint other nalious thought
necessary.
Reprcsentnlive Hensley askeil If a
race In building warships or In any
oilier in 11 it ary preparation between
Iwo nations had not invariably leil
In war. Admiral Fletcher said no, und
expressed (he opinion I hut failure to
prepare was merely making certain
Dial a uni Ion must surrender Its
rights.
Representative Callaway askeil lf It
was not reasonable to assume that the
European wur would end within n
year or a year and a half at most.
Admiral Fletcher thought il would,
anil addl'd that he believed the close
of the war will see the greatest op
portunity in history for the success
of an Internal ional (lisiirmnmeiit or
limitation of armament agreement. Hu
Insisted, however, Hull llie United
States could not afford to pill oft Its
navy building on Hull account.
"Why not put all otir energies luto
completing alii ph already authorized,"
Represent nil ve Callaway askeil, "and
so far as new building Is concerned,
awult the conclusion of the war?"
Admiral letcher repeated his state
men! tliul the hope of a disarmament
agreement was too vague lo build
upon.
Representative Oliver usked If any
thing had been developed within the
Iasi year lo shake Admiral Fletcher's
faith in heavy armored ships us the
main strength of a navy, lie naked
particularly if high explosive shells
had made armor Ichh trustworthy.
"There has been no development In
high explosive shells worth mention
ing, in that lime," Admiral Fletcher
replied.
Representative Callaway look the
witness through n number of hypothet
ical engagements to support his con
tention tin,I battleships In the pres
ence of submarines, mines and tor
pedoes no longer can tight In fleets.
Admiral Fletcher disagreed and re
sorted to paper and pencil to map out
the operations of two hostile fleets
under the eonitllions set.
Alter Admiral Fletcher concluded
hjs (esHiliimy, Rear Admiral Taylor.
idilef of llie bureau of construction,
and Admiral Griffin, chief of steum ell
gineering, explained to the commit
tee the situation as to the fleet sub
marines authorized last year. Secre
eisinii of this problem to congress,
bids on the two big Bubrnersthles au
U,orl * ,,fl not h " vinp: l ' i,llt ' n within the
requirements of the act. Admiral
Taylor said one bidder would guar
antee a 19-knot surface speed and
not the 20 knots specified in the act.
Both lie and Admiral Griffin recom
mended that Hie 19-knot proposal be
aeeepted. if the bouts could not he
made to do better.
Both admirals disagreed with Rear
Admiral Grant and other officers of
the submarine flotilla as to the desira
bility of abandoning all other types of
submersihles for a 800-ton boat similar
to those used by the German navy.
They believed It impossible that the
requirements as to speed, endurance
and habitability required hy Admiral
Grant could lie met.
Admiral Taylor recommended, how
ever. that three 800-ton boats he or
dered as AxperlmenJs, ordinary con
ditions of construction to be set
aside to produce them in the shortest
possible time. If the result, of tills
experiment was to bear out Admiral
Grant's statements, he said, it was
desirable to establish the fact as soon
as isjssible.
The committee reached no decision
on the question.
