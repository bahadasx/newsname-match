AIRMEN TO
CARRY MAIL
IN ALASKA
Postal Department Plans Seven Aerial
Routes in Far North and One in
Massachusetts; Will Make
Fast Time
By Vnited Press.
WASHINGTON D. C, March !).
With aeroplanes expected to cover 30
uilt-s an hour, Alaska soon will have
about the fastest mail service in the
world. For the dog-teams. Yukon liver
barges, frontier railways and trials, the
post office department will substitute
the latest type of planes, capable of
carrying S.OOCi ton loads, at more than
express train speed.
Betides the seven planned Alaska
routes, there is likely to be one in
Massachusetts. Economy is the pri
mary motive of the government, but
in at least ne of the Alaskan routes
the delivery of a letter which now
takes- two w eeks will be accomplished
in 12 hours.
In tho Massachusetts route starting
from Xew Bedford and serving the
islands of Martha's vineyard and Nan
tucket the big difficulty to overcome,
aid Second Assistant Postmaster
I'raeger today, will be fog. In Alaska,
difficulty is expected in finding suit
able landing places; in the cross-winds
that sweep in and out of mountain
ranges; and in tne intense cola tne
aviator will be subjected to in certain
seasons.
"But it is not the human facto
which wc rriea us most," continued
Praeger. Your skilled aviator of today
takes little account of wind and cold.
An extremely dense fog will delay serv
ice some, probably.
"Another difficulty will be getting
machines which will carry 3,000 pounds
of mail. There are such machines on
the European battlefields, ti ' tho de
mands of America may not have pro
duced such giant craft."
Praeger has advertised for such ma
chines and has appealed to the patriot
ic Impulses of national aerial societies
o show what American genius caji
do.
The main route in Alaska w ill be to
Fairbanks, in tlie interior. Its mail
now goes from the states to Skagway
by boat,, thence by rail, stage or dog
team to White Horse and the Yukon.
The substitutes will be aero service
from Valdez to Fairbanks direct, 33S
miles.
In the Massachusetts route the
planes will be used betwen mainland
and the outlying islands, across stormy
and treacherous rea-.-hes of water.
If these routes aiv. successful, says
Praeger, the opportunities for further
use of aviation mail service are almos:
iimiiless.

TEST NEW
PROCESS
By United Press.
WASHINGTON", D. C. March 9.
Congressman Randall ia preparing to
ask Henry Ford to test the so-called
Rittman process of manufacturing gas
oline. It is claimed that this process, which

duce the cost ot gasoline, Randall says
the government should manufacture it.
Congressman Britten proposes a bill
providing for an export tax of 50 cents
per gallon. This would require a con
