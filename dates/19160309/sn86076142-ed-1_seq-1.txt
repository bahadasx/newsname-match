President Fears Action by Congress
(Bv Associated Prese.)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 9. Faced by a new crisis In Mexican affairs through
the Columbus massacre, administration officials have admitted that the presl-
dent might find It difficult to refrain longer from actual Interference. What
tha barters, who favor "watchful waiting." fear most is an outbreak by
congress with Its consequent effect upon the country.
At the White House the only word given out was that steps would be
taken to punish the bandits. At the state department It was said that th
situation is "very serious." Secretary Baker took office and sent the presl
rfont i.i. rai.nrta i nnn R thev were received from General Funston. The
state department is said to have begun the draft of a memorandum to Car
ranza. based on General Funston's reports.
Secretary Lansing announced that the United States Is considering asking
General Carranza'g permission to send troops into Mexico to capture the
Villa bandits who raided Columbus. American troopers are pursuing the
raiders, uncertain as to how far they penetrated Mexico.
A purported Interview in the Reno
Journal, which was copied by the local
morning paper, quotes Herman Zadig
as saying that the first nm of ort'
from the Rescue-Eula ran only $10
a ton and that Tonopah people bad
only 100,000 shares in the mine, while
in Reno there were 200,000 shares,
there being 60,000 In one block. ,
J. C. Robertson, the broker, took b
poll of the other brokers and his own
clients and found that between ZOO.ooo
and a quarter of a million shares of
Rescue-Eula were owned 'In Tonopah
He then sent the following wire this
morning to Mr. Zadig in Sail Fran
cisco:
"Reno Journal quotes you sayinn
first shipment to mill from Rescw
values 110. Reports here Indicate
about $20. They also quote you say
Ing only hundred thousand Rescue
here. We all agree that it is closer
to Quarter million. Fine specimens

have some expression from you 7
Scarcely half an hour had elapsed
before back came the Drier, Dut ex
pressive reply: "Mr. J. C. Robertson
Never saw any man trom iteno jour
nal. First shipment went $21.50. Mine
looking very good. H. .AUll.
A naner published in Tonopah on
the ground that would publish such an
Interview without having the same
officially authenticated, knowing that
$10 ore is not worked in tne nuns oi
Tonopah, shows poor business man
agement and lack of knowledge of
Tonopah conditions.
The shipment was made last Sun
day and was the llrst consignment to
be sent from the property, inasmuch
as It was made almost entirely from
the crosscut where the vein was en
countered, it Is naturally the expecta
tion of the management that when
drifting and Moping are regularly in
progress the values will be improved
All the news relating to the Tonopah
Extension Mining eompany is good
news. The downward continuation of
the Murray vein to at least the 1540
level has not only been conclusively
proven, but its increasing width and
value as well. At the point mentioned
it was reached by the crosscut from
the Victor and an upraise is now be
ing driven on It to meet the winze bo
gun from the 1350 level of the Exten
sion. It will require about two weeks
more work to make the connection, the
headings now being separated by
about sixty feet on the dip of the vein
Where the vein was eut by the Vic
tor drive it showed a width of thirty
feet. Twenty-five feet of this ore body
will run $20 to the ton. As soon as
the connection is made, drifts will be
run both east and west and that por
tion of the mine placed in readiness
for stoping.
Machinery is now being put in the
sorting shed. The electric railroad
connecting the Victor bins with the
Extension mill will be in operation by
the middle of April. This Is an ex
tension of the third rati line that runs
from the mill to the No. 2 shaft.
Foundations for the tube mill and for
ten additional stamps will be started
at once and will be in readiness when
this equipment arrives.
