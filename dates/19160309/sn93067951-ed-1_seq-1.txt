y a weeKiy Review
Of The Great Wa
The significance of the Gei
man attack upon Verdun ma
be seen from any map or histor
of France. A straight line is th
shortest distance between tw
points. On the line bet.wee
Metz and Paris stands the fort
^ ress of Verdun. The reason wti
the Germans did not. go straigh
from Metz to Paris is becausi
Verdun was in the way. The;
wept to the north of it instead
ifirmiirh Itrdcinm thninrh fhu
net made it certain thai
England would be counts
among her enemies and tha
neutral nations would be alien
ated.
This was bad policy from a po
litical point of view and it ma]
now be questioned whether i
was good policy from a military
point of view.
[The Verdun forts before the
war were constructed on th<
same general plans as those ol
Liege and Namar. The guns
were placed in movable steel cupolas,
shaped like a saucer, anc
protected by a ring of concrete
so heavy as to be invulnerable
to the artillery of'.the time- But
a shell (ired with a modern high
explosive dropt em one of these
cupolas does not glance oil', but
explodes. The concrete and
sttel structure is blasted tc
pieces and the gunners crushed
^fcui.focated by the gas evolved,
is why Liege and Nainur
taken within two days af
fcwenty-eight-centiineter
^^^^^^Hhud been brought to bear
them.

LVJr. U. LVI. Barentine
Passes Away
Mr. D. M. Barentine former
owner of The (Jhesterfleld Advertiser
and one of Chesterfield's
most prominent and respected
citizens, died at his home on
Green St. near midnight of last
Thursday night. The death of
this good man was not unexpected,
a9 he had hovered between
life and death for several |
days before the end came.
About three weeks ago Mr. "
Barentine suffered an attack of {
the grip. From this 8e seemed
on the road to recovery and was
on the street two weeks ago
from to-day. He suffered a relapse,
however, which, complicated
with arterio sclerosis, was
the cause of his death.
A marked sense of sadness
prevailed throughout the town
for two days, manifesting the
universality of esteem in which
Mr- Barentine was held.
Mr. Barentine was born in
L850 and was married in 1873 to
Miss Nannie McOreight. There
vera five children, all of whom
ire living. They are Mrs. D. g
Fl. Laney, Mrs. B. F. Kobeson, *
Mr. (). L. Barentine and Miss
/Vnnie Barentine, of this com- *
nunity, and Mr. Walter E. Barmtine.
of Moultrie, G&. Fie is
ilso survived by a brother, Mr.
lohn Barentine, of Olio, and a
lister, Mrs. Ella Turlington, of
Baltimore.
Mr. Barentine always took a
ively interest in the affairs of
lis county and State. For seviral
years he was auditor of Cheslertield
county, after which he
lerved several terms as probate udge.
At the timo of his death [f
le was clerk of the Board of 5
Jonnty commissioners. =
For a good many years Mr. E
Barentine was owner and editor E
>f The Chesterfield Advertiser. 5
in this work he was recognized E
is a man of positive convictions E
ind of great breadth of mind. E
The upbuilding of the county E
va8 always his first thought. E
Mr. Barentine was a member E
if the Methodist church. To E
he church he gave liberally of jjj
lis time and means. For almost E
forty years he was a steward in E
5t. Paul church and for years E
vas chairman of the board of E
rustees. His church honored E
lim by sending him to the Dist E
ict Conference from year to: E
rear, and often he was a dele- i E
;ate to the Annual Conference. S
3e always stood loyally by his E
luty to his church. LThe
funeral services were con- E
lucted Saturday afternoon by E
lis pastor, Kev. J. L Tyler, and E
;he body laid to rest in the Ches- E
ierfield cemetery. [I
Fire in Lancaster
A disasterous fire occured in
Lancaster on March 6th, in the ^
:otton mill village, when six
itore rooms and a barber shop '
vere completely destroyed by
[ho flames which, once started, a!
being fanned at the time by a d
itifF breeze, quickly spread from c?
>ne building to another with 8
inch fury that the combined ef- V
forts of the Lancaster fire com- tl
pany and the mill fire depart- li
ment could effect but little to- ti
wards extinguishing the fire- d
ii is saia ui&t in most, eases t<
there was very little insurance ?J
carried, either on these build- g<
ings or their contents. The fire g
was one of the biggest seen f<
there in some time. a

II. T. Straynge, Gainesville, t
Ga., II. R. No. 8, was unable to 0
sleep all night without getting .
up. "Sometimes only a few min
utes after going to bed, 1 would P

Pageland Fight Case
In Criminal Court ?
i
Criminal Court couyened Monday
morning. A record crowd
was in attendance on account of j
Pageland war cases being set for
trial. For three days now the 1
interest has remained unabated <
on the pending case of South {
Carolina against no less than (
ten separate defendants for the
murder of Dock Wallace on March *
j L2th last during the riot at '
. Pageland. The town of Chester.
field has been over-run by the '
W unmnfAiio *11
ouiuuiuuj muucancH mill oilierH
who are in Chesterfield to hear
the trials. From the opening
day of Court, Monday, through
Wednesday, the court house *
has been crowded at all times. 1
Good order prevails and while
there is an under-current of
feeling the officers believe that
whatever the outcome of the <
trials there will not be any out- *
break like that at Pageland last 1
year.
When court convened Monday ?
morning, the fust case called t
was that of the State against t
C. W. Arant and J. M. Arant, i
| H. H. West, Luther West, Bax- i
ter West, Arthur West, Shepherd
West, John West, Luther c
Wallace and Walter Wallace 1
for the murder of Dock Wallace ?
and Wesley Arant. The solici- f
tor has indicted all defendants ?
jointly for two separate mur- ?
ders. As predicted in this pa- 1
per several weeks ago the attorneys
reprepresenting the var- u
ious defendants immediately c
moved to quash the indictment t
on the ground that the defend- c
ants could not be charged in the i
same indictment with two sup- t
J arate murders?that separate I
i trials were necessary. After <
: considerable argument 'he sol- t
i icitor stated that he was going (
i to be frank with the court?that 1
I he was in error?and to remedy c
; matters he was going to strike t
i off the name of Wesley Arant v
: from the indictment and let 1
i same stand against the defend- q
i ants for the murder of Deck e
; Wallace alone. The solicitor e
| gave notice, however, that he t
| was going to hand to the Grand t
: Jury a new indictment against
j all the defendants for the mur- v
| der of Wesley Arant. E
| The Judge then ordered the e
\ case to trial, the situation being a
: as follows: The ten defendants
above named are being tried e
under a joint indictment alleg- c
ing that they are all guilty of <
riot and the murder of Dock e
Wallace. The solicitor takes a
the position and so charges in 1
the indictment that all the defendants,
the Arants and the e
Wests-Wallaces?both factions c
?met at Pageland and by a 1
preconceived agreement, either r
expressed or implied, agreed to a
r fight it out. The solicitor alleges i
- that the riot was nothing more i
. nor less tl an a mutual combat, a
that it is immaterial who fired c
, the fatal shot that killed Wal t
( lace, that all were engaged in a c
? mutual combat, that the hand I
) of one was the hand of all. (
? The state relied principally t
, upon Rural l'olieement .lames I

f the State was that Dock Wal- t
3 lace was killed by Walker Arant i
. and that Wesley Arant was 1
j. killed by Sheppard Went. How t
B ever both men wero killed dur- j
t ing the free for all fight while i
shots were Hying in every direction
and the evidence of the <
. defense now being heard is con- (
- tradictory to the States evi- !
s uence. The evidence was that 1
