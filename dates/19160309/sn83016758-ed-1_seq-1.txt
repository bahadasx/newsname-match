PRIMARYJELECTION
Candidates for Delegates to be Voted
for on Town Meeting Day,
Next Tuesday.
Polls Open and Close as Usual for
Town and Village OfficersUn-
til 9 p. m. for Delegates.
fc
Next Tuesday the voters of Minne
sota will select delegates to the sev
eral national conventions to nominate
candidates for president and vice-pres
ident.
For the first time the presidential
primary law will be in operation in this
state and the vomers will be afforded
the opportunity of voting direct for
delegates.
There is only one democratic can
didate for the presidencyWoodrow
Wilson. But in this state there is lively
opposition between the Lynch and anti
Lynch wings of the party, and in the
state at large as well as in each of the
congressional districts there are two
sets of delegates.
As far as the republicans of Minne
sota are concerned they are obliged to
vote for delegates favorable to either
Cummins or Estabrook. Under the
provisions of that beautiful piece of
fad legislationthe presidential pri
mary lawthey have no choice in the
matter they must vote for delegates
ostensibly for either Cummins or Esta
brook. Thousands of republican voters
may favor Hughes or Roosevelt, but
they have no means of expressing
their choice.
As a matter of fact no one who is
at all posted on the political situation
expects to see either Cummins or Es
tabrook nominated at Chicagoneither
of them stands one chance in ten.
Then the only thing for the republi
cans of this state to do is to vote
for delegates to the republican national
convention who can be trusted to ex
ercise good common sense in the Chi
cago convention and act for the best
interests of the party and the nation,
for the probabilities are that if the
right men are nominated for president
and vice-president they will be elected
in November.
But who are the right men That is
for the members of the republican
national convention, after mature de
liberation, to determine. Let us send
delegates whose advice and counsel
will be of some assistance in these
deliberations. Delegates who will be
consulted and advised with by delegates
from, other states. We realize that it
would be hardly possible to select 24
delegates of this caliber, but there
should be at least three or four men
on the delegation who are known out
side the confines of Minnesota. Men
for instance like Frederick C. Stevens,
who has served 18 years in congress,
Hon. J. F. Jacobson who has on two
previous occasions creditably repre
sented his party in republican national
conventions, William Henry Eustis,
whose speech nominating Blaine in the
Minneapolis convention of 1892 gave
him a national reputation, and Marcus
Johnson, who also has a wide acquain
tance among public men outside the
state. There are other capable and
deserving men not as well known per
haps as those above mentioned, who
would like to go as delegates, men like
Hon. Henry Rines of Mora, former
speaker of the Minnesota house of rep
resentatives, and Hon. James Mana
han, former congressman-at-large
yfrom this state.
There are only four delegates to be
elected at large and two from each
congressional district. If the voter
votes for more than four delegates-at
large his vote does not count. He may
vote for less than four delegates-at
large and his vote counts for the dele
gates for whom he votes, but if he
votes for more than four he has spoiled
his ballot and his vote does not count
for any of those for whom he has
voted.
For congressional delegates the
voter must vote for two only. There
are only two to be elected from each
"congressional district.
The Union will not attempt to dic
tate who should be sent as delegates,
but from our personal knowledge of
the men we have no hesitation in say
ing that the republican voter who votes
for such men for delegates-at-large as
J. F. Jacobson, Frederick C. Stevens,
James Manahan, Marcus Johnson and
O. J. Larson will make no mistake.
(One of the five mentioned must be
dropped as only four can be elected.)
Men like these would represent the
state intelligently in the Chicago con
vention.
In the Tenth congressional district it
seems to us that our neighbor Hon.
.Henry Rines of Mora, and William
i tSA
fa* id^^MMm4ir^^^^^^^mm^ 3
Henry Eustis of Minneapolis, are fit
and proper men to select as delegates.
Mr. Rines is certainly well qualified,
and he is the only candidate for dele
gate from the rural counties of the
Tenth congressional district. Mr. EusT
tis is known far and wide as the silver
tongued orator, and he is a man of
national reputation. Rines and Eustis
would make a good team to send from
the Tenth congressional district.
Sherburne and Benton counties are
comprised in the Sixth congressional
district. There are four candidates for
delegates under the Cummins banner
C. A. Allbright of Brainerd, Geo. E.
Hanscom of St. Cloud, Charles Hay
den of Beltrami county, and Peter O.
Scow of Long Prairie. All of them are
good reliable men. But there are only
two to be chosen.
On the democratic side there are two
bunches of candidatesfour eachfor
delegates-at-large. The regulars or
the convention candidates are Daniel
W. Lawler, of St. Paul, Anton C.
Weiss of Duluth, B. F. Nelson of Min
neapolis and Henry F. Wessel of
Crookston. If we affiliated with the
democratic party we would have no
hesitancy in voting for the first three
above mentioned. The other anti-con
vention bunch is composed of Z. H.
Austin, W. A. Just, Julius J. Reiter
and Cyrus King. Only four can be
chosen.
In the Tenth congressional district
there are four democratic candidates
S. J. Mealey, J. F. Williamson, A. S.
Dowdall and Guy A. Thomas. Mr.
Mealey is a Monticello man and is a
good fellow. Mealey and Williamson
are the regulars and stand the best
chance of winning.
In the Sixth congressional district,
of which Sherburne and Bention coun
ties are a part, the democratic candi
dates are Fred Schilplin, J. B. Galar
neault, Wm. F. Donohue and H. C.
Baer. Messrs. Schilplin and Galar
neault are the regulars. Fred Schil
plin is a St. Colud boy and very popu
lar. He will undoubtedly be elected
one of the delegates. Mr. Galarneault
is now a banker at Aitkin. He was for
merly county auditor of Benton county.
It is unnecessary to mention the
other minor political parties as they
will not figure to any large extentjln
the general result. The next president
and vice-president will be nominated
by the republican national convention
at Chicago, or by the democratic na
tional convention at St. Louis.
Once more we wish to impress upon
the voters that only four delegates
can be elected at large. If the vojer
votes for more than four his ballot is
spoiled and his vote does not count.
Vote for only two delegates from a
congressional district, only two can be
elected.
The polls open at 9 a. m., and close
at 9 p. m., as far as presidential dele
gates are concerned. We presume the
polls for the election of town officers
will open and close at the usual hours
from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., and vil
large officers the same.
There must be a separate ballot box
at each election precinct for the presi
dential delegatesone ballot box for
delegate ballots and one for ballots for
town or village officers.
The voter will ask the judges of
election for the ballot of the political
party with which he affiliates if he de
sires to vote for delegates.
Once more, we reiterate, vote for
only four delegates-at-large, and for
only two delegates from the congres
sional district.
Moses E. Jesmer.
Moses E. Jesmer succumbed to
Bright's disease at his home in this
village on Monday afternoon at 4
o'clock. His health had not been the
best for several years, but up to five
weeks ago he was able to attend to his
affairs, being actively engaged in the
barber business.
The last sad rites were conducted
yesterday morning from St. Edward's
church. Rev. Fr. Willenbrink officiat
ed, and the Catholic choir sang. In
terment was in the Catholic cemetery.
Moses E. Jesmer was born in Green
bush, this county, on August 30, 1864,
and, aside from a couple of years pass
ed in Mora, lived in this vicinity all of
his life. On January 10, 1904, he was
united in marriage to Miss May Dugah.
The widow and five childrenClaire,
Albert, Evelyn, Melba and Bernard
survive him. Six brothers and one
sister also survive, viz:Nelson, of Win
nipeg, Canada Louis, of Princeton
Joseph, of Seattle, Washington Wil
liam, of Spokane, Washington Albert
and Hubert of Los Angeles, California,
and Mrs, Leroy Bowen, of Colorado.
Deceased was of a guiet and unas
suming disposition, but was respected
by all who formed his acquaintance,
and his death marks the passing of a
good citizen.

BLUE HILLTRAGEDY
Fatal Shooting of Henry Woods Fol-
lows Quarrel Over Owner-
ship of Hay Stack.
Frank Kalen Faces Charge of Man-
slaughter in Second De-
greeHearing Today.
As a result of a quarrel over the
ownership of a stack of wild hay,
Henry Woods of Zimmerman came to
an untimely end Monday evening, and
Frank Kalen faces a charge of man
slaughter in the second degree.
The killing occured on the N. A.
Lind farm in Blue Hill, Sherburne
county, and was witnessed by Ray
Grover of Zimmerman, a cousin of the
dead man. His version of the deplor
able affairs follows:
Up to three weeks ago Henry Woods
and his wife and family occupied a
portion of the Lind farm, and Frank
Kalen occupied the balance of same.
Mr. Woods it appears was in straiten
ed circumstances financially, and three
weeks ago sent his wife and children
to Iowa (the Woods had been residents
of Blue Hill only a few months, going
there from Iowa last August) and lo
cated in Zimmerman, temporarily,
himself. Previous to this it is alleged
that he traded a cow and a calf to Ka
len for the stack of hay in question,
$10 cash and a sack of flour. The
cow and calf were not healthy, and it
was also stipulated that if they lived
Kalen was to give Mr. Woods the dif
ference between the value of the hay,
money and flour, and $35. The cow
and calf died, however.
Monday afternoon Mr. Woods, ac
companied by Mr. Grover, drove out
to the Lind farm and started to load
the hay onto a rack. Kalen appeared
on the scene, claimed the hay, and
heated words followed. Kalen then
ran to the Albert Roman farm home,
about 20 rods distant, helped himself
to a 12-guage shotgun, returned and
pointed it at Mr. Woods' chest. Woods
siezed the gun by the barrel and while
lowering it a shell was exploded the
charge~ entering Mr. Woods'-left leg
jusbte above the Kalen appeared Preparingkneeshoot
to again, when
Mr. Grover siezed the gun, pushed the
barrel into the snow, and another shell
was discharged. No one was injured
by the second shot, but about a foot of
the gun barrel was blown off.
Kalen then apparently realized the
seriousness of his hasty action, and
assisted Mr. Grover to place the unfor
tunate victim on the load of hay. Inas
much as the team was rathertired, and
the roads were in bad condition, the
wounded man was removed, considera
ble of the hay pitched off to lighten
the load, and then Mr. Grover proceed
ed to the James-Stevenson residence,
a mile distant, with Mr. Woods. Kalen
did not remain on the scene long after
assisting Mr. Grover when Woods was
first placed on the hay load.
No attempt was made to get the in
jured man into the Roman residence
nearby as the Woods and Roman fami
lies were not upon friendly terms.
The shooting occurred at about 5
o'clock and the Stevenson home was
not reached until half an hour later,
and by this time Mr. Woods was very
weak from loss of blood and
sinking fast. Dr. H. C. Cooney of
Princeton was communicated with over
the telephone, and he advised that a
tight bandage be put around the thigh
of the wounded leg, to stop the flow
of blood and sent a rig out to convey
the unfortunate man to the Northwest
ern hospital. The end came at 20 min
utes to seven, however, and when a
team from a Princeton livery arrived
Mr Woods had been dead over an
hour. The roads were in such condi
tion as to make fast driving impos
sible.
The Sherburne county authorities
were notified and Kalen was arrested
by Deputy Sheriff E. H. Foley of Zim
merman Tuesday morning at 3 o'clock.
He was located in the John Lind
home, having made no attempt to es
cape.
A coroner's inquest was held at Elk
River yesterday, and the jury decid
ed that Henry Woods came to his
death at the hands of Frank Kalen,
and advised that Kalen be held to the
grand jury. Kalen does not deny the
shooting, but claims that the gun was
accidentally discharged. The coro
ner's jury held, however, that his
handling of the weapon was criminal
negligence.
Kalen will be arraigned for his pre
liminary hearing before an Elk River
justice of the peace today on a charge
of manslaughter in the second degree,
ASSESSORS^MEETING At Court House Yesterday Attended
by 11 of the 21 Assessors of
Mille Lacs County.
State Tax Commission Represented by
Hon James T. Hale Who
Talked Interestingly.
The meeting of assessors of Mille
Lacs county at the court house yester
day was not as largely attended as
expected, due no doubt to the deplor
able condition of the roads. There are
21 assegment districts in the county,
and 11 of these were represented.
Hon. James T. Hale of the state tax
commission addressed the assessors
in regard to their dutxjs valuing
the real and personal property of the
county this year, and his remarks were
interesting and instructive. He told
the assessors that their main duty was
to give all property its true and full
market value and then to assess it for
the various percentages of its true and
full value as provided by the classified
assessment law now in force in this
state.
The amount of money raised by tax
ation does not depend upon the as
sessors' figures. The legislature,
county commissioners, town meetings,
village and city aldermen vote the
amount to be raised by taxation.
Whether each and every taxpayer
pays his just and due proportion of
the taxes voted depends of course upon
the valuation placed upon his prop
erty by the assessor, so every tax
payer is more interested in seeing that
every other taxpayer's property is
valued at its percentage of its true and
full value than the assessor.
Complaints of over-assessment are
quite frequent, but they mostly come
from the taxpayer comparing his tax
able valuation with his neighbor's and
if his neighbor's property is underval
ued by the assessor he immediately
thinks he is overvalued, whereas in
fact his valuation may be just right
of even low. So it becomes very im
portant for the assessor to be careful
andc-value all property at its true -and
full value and then assess it at its
proper percentage of true and full
value, otherwise he will hear many
complaints and he justly should.
The taxpayer who is undervalued
pays less taxes than he should, and
consequently the man whose property
is valued as it should be pays more
taxes than he should. He practically
pays part of the taxes of the man who
is undervalued. Mr. Hale then said
that it depended upon the assessors
as to whether the taxpayers had a
fair deal or not. If the assessments
were all fairly made it then depended
upon the voters whether their taxes
were high or low according to the
amounts they or their representatives
voted to spend.
Out of every hundred dollars of tax
es paid by the taxpayers of Mille Lacs
county this year $3.52 will go to the
state $40.09 will go to education
$26.98 will go to the road and bridge
fund $15.68 will go to the county
$10.19 will go to cities and villages
$3.54 will go to townships and for
every dollar the county pays the state
in taxes the county gets back from
the state $3.43 for roads, schools, etc.
This shows that more than all the
amount of taxes paid by this county is
spent in this county, and that the main
portion of it goes to education and
roads and bridges. Platted property
(village and city property) is assessed
at 40% of its full and true value. Un
platted pronertv (farm property) is
assessed at 33 1-3% of its full and
true value.
This is in compliance with the new,
so-called classified assessment law and
apparently seemed just and equitable
to the legislature, and whatever the
assessor's personal view or opinions
and the probabilities are that he will years of age, and the victim of the
waive examination, in which event he shooting 'was about 35 years old.
will be held to the grand jury.
The hay in question was of trifling
value, and it seems incredible that it
should lead to such tragic results.
Last fall and winter Kalen was em
ployed in Princeton as a waiter in the
restaurant adjoining Payette's photo
studio, and last sping he operated a
lunch room in the JCaliher building ad
joining the First National Bank, for
a couple of weeks. Since that time he
has been on the Lind farm in Blue
Hill. To some in Princeton he was
known as 'Dago Frank," having been
given the nickname of one of the New
York gunmen executed for the mur
der of Herman Rosenthal, the gam
bler. He was not actually considered
to be a desperate character, however.
He is a young man, probably about 27
maybe he is bound by law to follow this
statutory provision. This law makes
the cities and villages pay more taxes
in proportion to the true and full value
of their property than unplatted or
farm lands.
Mr. Hale told the assessors that the
greatest difficulty they would have
would be in finding property now
classed as "money and credits" which
consists of promissory notes, bonds,
book accounts, money on deposit in
banks, etc., because of its not being
possible for the assessor to see the
same, but they were expected to fol
low the law strictly and if any citizen
refused to make a sworn statement as
to "money and credits" to levy an as
sessment against him. The tax on
"money and credits" has been fixed by
law at three mills on the dollar of
\aiue and being so much lower than
the rate on all other classes of prop
tity the tax commission expects ev
ery person to reporst the sameoand if
he makes not sworn report stating that
he either or has not any money
sor are make
ass
shas
an an arbitrary assessment against him
and add fifty per cent thereto as a
penalty for not making a sworn report.
Civil War Veteran Passes Away.
Another esteemed Princeton pio
neer, and a veteran of the Civil war,
joined the great majority when Charles
Anderson departed this life at the
home of his daughter, Mrs. Oswald
King, in this village on Wednesday ev
ening of last week. General break
down due to old age was the cause of
death
Brief and simple funeral services
were conducted from the King resi
dence Saturday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock, and were largely attended.
Rev. E. B. Service delivered the ser
mon, and the Methodist quartet sang
several beautiful selections. Inter
ment was in Oak Knoll cemetery.
Charles Anderson was born in Bruns
wick, Maine, August 9, 1834, so at the
the time of his demise was 81 years,
six months and 21 days old. He was
united in marriage in 1854 to Miss Ly
dia Cole, and came to Princeton the
same year. Eight children blessed
this union, six of whom are living, viz:
Mrs. V. D. Crandal, Robbinsdale Robt.
Anderson, Pheonix, Arizona John An
derson, Mrs. Oswald King, Mrs. Alice
Townsend and Mrs. A. Howard of
Princeton. Mrs. Anderson answered
the final summons 27 years ago.
Deceased was a good and patriotic
citizen and served three years in the
war of the Rebellion with honor and
credit, being a member of Co. of the
immortal First Minnesota. Each year
the grim reaper exacts his toll in the
ranks of the survivors of those who
battled to preserve the unity of our
country, and it is ever an unpleasant
task to chronicle the passing of one of
the old boys in blue.
The children desire to express their
sincere appreciation to the neighbors
and other friends who kindly tendered
sympathy and aid to them in their be
reavement. They are truly thankful.
Balfanz-Falk.
Mr. Henry Balfanz and Miss Marie
Falk were united in marriage at the
German Lutheran church in Princeton
town on Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Rev. Otto Strauch performed the cer
emony, and about 200 relatives and
friends were present. Misses Clara
Henschel and Flora Falk attended the
bride, and Messrs. Chas. Manske of St.
Paul, and Anton Falk, jr., of Prince
ton were the groom's attendants.
A reception was given at the home
of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Anton Falk, in Princeton town, after
the ceremony and a bounteous wed
ding dinner was served. Mr. and Mrs.
Balfanz received numerous beautiful
and useful gifts.
The bride and groom are popular
young people, and a large circle of
friends extend congratulations. They
will reside on the farm operated by the
bride's parents.
Measurements Taken.
Measurements have been taken for
the new base ball uniforms in which
the Princeton ball team will be attired,
and the order will be sent in as soon
as Harold Caley's measurements ar
rive from Cambridge, Mass, where he
is attending Harvard university.
The uniforms will be white, and
trimmed with blue, a neat combination.
The word "Princeton" will adorn the
front, and the merchants who donated
the money to purchase them, volun
tarily decided to not have individual
advertising matter thereon. The socks
will be blue with white stripes around
the center, and white feet. White caps
with a blue vizor,, and a blue "P" on
the front will be provided, and the
boys will indeed look spick and span
when they don the outfit.
VOLUME XL. NO. 1 2
A SIGHTLY SITE
If a New School Building is Necessary:
Locate It Where It Can
Be Seen.
Build for the Future as Well as the
PresentTemporary Make-
shifts Undesirable.
The Union was in hopes that we
could get along without a new school
building in Princeton for a year or
two yet, or at least until our two main
streets were permanently improved.
But it seems in the near future, if not
now, more school facilities must be
provided.
A pew school building cannot be
erected in a month or in a year. Means
must be provided for the erection of
the samebably It wouldarequirebefor a bond is
sue. If the bonds were voted, and a
loan was sought from the state it
woul
pro be year the
same could be granted, as there are
applications for loans from the per
manent funds now pending aggregat
ing over a million dollars. Of course
the bonds of the district might be sold
to private parties, but it would be at
a higher rate of interest than the
state would exact. A loan could be
obtained from the state at 4%. Pri
vate parties would demand five or six
per cent. It would not be ad
visable to negotiate a loan at a higher
rate than 4%.
If a new school building is to be
erected it should not be a little dinky
makeshift it should be a structure
that would meet the requirements of
the district for years to come, and one
that would be a credit to the village
and district, and it should be centrally
located on a sightly site.
It is claimed by some that if the out
sidersthe pupils outside the district
were to be excluded from our schools
we would have room enough and to
spare. This cannot be done. One of
the requisites of a high school as pro
vided by the statutes is that, "it shall
admit, free of tuition charge, students
of either sex resident in the state." The
great majority, probably 95 per c^nt,
of the high school pupils of Princeton
are residents of the district or with
in a few miles of its boundaries. Any
how, a Chinese wall cannot be built
around the Princeton high school.
There is probably not a high school in
the state that has not pupils from out
side districts, and the Princeton school
is no exception to the rule.
Anent a site: The Union is not pre
judiced in favor of any particular site
for a new school building, but we do
believe that no more sightly one, no
one more centrally located than block
34bounded on the east by E street,
on the north by Sixth street, on the
west by F. street, and on the south by
Fifth streetcould be selected.
