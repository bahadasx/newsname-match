Tonight at the Phelan opera house
will be held the second annual ban-'
net and election of directors for the
Alliance Commercial Club. The date
lor the annual banquet was first set
tor Wednesday night, March 8. but
wing to the fact that this was Ash
Wednesday and the attending of the
neetlng of this kind on that day con
futed with the religious principles of
Mine of the members of the organiz
ation, the date was changed to to
aghL The banquet will be served tonight
by the ladies of the Christian church,
which fact is sufficient guarantee of
tho Buccess of that part of the pro
gram. The ladies of the Christian
etsrch have showed on previous oc
casions their ability in this line and
the one hundred and fifty or more
Miens of Alliance to whom tockets
have been sold for the event have
pretty well in mind what is in store
tor them.
Henry Augustus Buchtel, former
ajrrernor of the state of Colorado,
1117-1909, and present Chancellor of
ike University of Denver, will be the
principal speaker. He will talk on
"The Pleasantness of American
life." Chancellor Buchtel, who is a
platform lecturer of some renoun and
who has received only the most favor
able of criticism from the press
wherever he has been called in this
capacity, bears the distinction of be
tas the only clergyman and college
president ever elected to the gover
norship of a state in the United
Bate. v . ;
He was widely known as a minister
4 the Methodist Episcopal church
before he was called to the Chancel
lorship of the University of Denver
m the fall of 1899. At that time the
alversity was overwhelmed with
ebt. The Chancellor put his life in
to the campaign for the salvation of
the University, and won. It required
e-quarter of a million dollars to
extinguish the mortgage debt. More
than two-thirds of a million dollars
have now been secured in donations
frem more than ten thousand people
la the state of Colorado. The Chan
ceil or 'a wide travels in the University
campaign made him acquainted with
afl sorts and conditions of men in ev
evy part of Colorado. It was this
wide acquaintance which justified the
leaders in his political party in ask
lag him to become a candidate for
governor at a critical time in the his
tory of the state. His address to
night will undoubtedly be one of the
beet that the citizens of Alliance will
ver have the opportunity of hearing.

CITY ORDERS SPECIAL
CLEAN-UP AT ONCE
Inspection Will lie Made Monday of
Public and Private Prem
ises by Officials
Company's coming and special
preparations must be made. Do your
spring housecleanlng at once, that is,
next week, and put on your best bib
and tucker. So orders the city po
lice department, and woe unto them
who fail to heed the order, for in
this case there will be no favorites
and no exceptions will be made.
Several thousand visitors will be
In Alliance the weeks of March 20
and March 27 for the land drawing
and the auction sale, and you know
it's custom when visitors are expect
ed to do a little extra cleaning up
about the home. And even if it
wasn't custom, you should have civic
pride enough to do your part in put
ting Alliance, the biggest little city
in the world, in such condition that
nothing but the most favorable im
pression will be made on each and
every one of the thousands of strang
ers who are coming.
Not that Alliance isn't presentable
or hasn't been kept clean for we have
the reputation now of being ahead of
other cities in our class, but, in fol
lowing the ordinary pursuits of life.
all of us are prone to forget the little
things, the unkemnt appearaYice of
front yards, the litter in the back
yards, the rubbish, ashes and manure
piles in the alleys. Such little things
as these have come on so gradually
that we have not noticed them but
they would be among the first things
noticed by our visitors.
The city of Alliance has an ordin
ance prohibiting such things but the
officials have been lenient with Alii
ance citizens to the extent that some
thine must be done. You should not
make it necessary to have your indiv
idual attention called to this matter
however, it's up to you. Monday
morning an inspection will be made
that will include every street and al
ley in the town and also the condition
of private premises. If necessary
suggestions will be made to you and
you can govern yourself accordingly.
If you don't the matter will be
threshed out in the court of officials
whose sympathy, we imagine, will be
with the law and you will be working
against odds.
If every citizen will do his part
cheerfully, there will be no trouble.
no costs worth mentioning and Alii
ance will be ready in Sunday attire
for her company.
The city scavenger. Sam Shelton &
Co., are in the business of keeping
Alliance celan. They make a small
charge for their assistance but it is
only nominal. For fifty cents per
month, this firm will bend their wag
on to your alley door, or to our front
door, which ever you please, once ev
ery week to carry away any rubbish
that m:y have accumulated. In the
busin -, district their charge is more
an'T they cover the territory twice a
w-ek. A phone message to 575 will
tiring their services. They will be on
the job all next week and will have
teams and men ni.ugh to handle all
ne rubbish occasioned by this spec
ial clean-up.
The city ordinance makes it a mis
demeanor to have about your prem
ises anything that might be declared
a nuisance, and this includes the lit
tle things we have mentioned such as
rubbish piles, ash piles and manure
piles. The penalty Axed Is a fine of
not more than one hundred dollars.
Alliance is putting on the big auc
tion sale in an endeavor to induce a
few hundred respectable citizens
from all over the I nited States to
come here and be one of us. The
first impression is said to be a lasting
impression, and Alliance wants to ap
pear at her best. Nothing that can
reasonably be done should be left un
done, and we believe that the appeal
of the officials will meet with a ready
response from every individual.
Fire DefwrtJiieiU Meeting
The Alliance volunteer tire depart
ment held one of the best attended
sessions in its history Wednesday ev
ening at the department headquar
ters in the city hall. Nearly every
member of the department was pres
ent. Nominations were opened for
officers for the coming year and oth
er interesting business transacted.
New members were initiated and ex
emption papers granted to members
who had served five years. Election
of officers will be held at the regular
meeting on March 22.

MAY ORGANIZE TO DEAL
WITH THE DELINQUENTS
Many Cose in City Reiortcl as Need
ing Immediate Attention of
the City Official
So many cases of children improp
erly cared for and being brought up
in improper surroundings have been
brought to the attention of the city
officials recently that a movement is
now on foot for a roncerted action of
the city and county officials in co-operation
with the school authorities to
investigate these cases and make
proper disposition of them.
Numerous complaints have been
made lately of young lads "pulling
off stunts" that cannot longer be tol
erated under the classification of mis
chievousness. Boys, most of them
belonging to a gang that runs togeth
er, have been especially troublesome
In the way of annoying old people
and little children by throwing stones
and clods at them, and of throwing
at and breaking windows. Some of
the same crowd of boys have been
caught in the act of stealing Bmall ar
ticles from several of the stores.
Their work is done more in a spirit
of daring rather than any idea of in
juring any one or for the intrinsic
value of the articles taken but back
of it all lies the fact that these are
the things that ultimately make real
criminals, and it is probable that in
some cases the cause lies In improper
conditions, teaching and example in
the home.
Several cases have been brought to
the attention of the police matron
lately of children being reared in
homes where the mothers are of de
cidedly disreputable character. The
law provides for the disposition of
such cases as these and with the feel
ing that these children are being rais
ed under a handicap that will affect
their entire lives and in order to put
these children in surroundings that
will permit them an equal chance
with their playmates ns they grow
up, officials are going to thoroughly
prob all such cases that come to their
notice.
The city police department, Police
Matron Mrs. Sharp, County Judge
Berry and County Attorney Basye
will have the co-operation of school
officials in this work and undoubted
ly much good will he accomplished
not only for the city of Alliance but
for the future welfare of the children J
concerned.
BURNS FOR SHERIFF
Another Candidate Now on Ticket tor
Democratic Nomination for
Sheriff of Box Butte
John Burns, old time Box Butte
ranchman and farmer, is now a can
didate for the Democratic nomination
for the office of sheriff, his papers
having been tiled this morning. "Mr.
Burns is at present in San Antonio,
Texas, but will return to Alliance by
April 1.
R. M. Hampton, who met Mr.
Burns on his recent southern and
western trip, filed the papers for him
"Jack", as he is familiarly known,
has a wide acquaintance throughout
the county, having been one of th
first settlers.
This now makes three candidates
for the Democratic nomination: Cal
Cox, the present incumbent; A. A
Ralls and Mr. Burns.

BUILDINGS ON FEDERAL
SITE SOLD AT AUCTION
Loral Parties Bid on Old Shacks tit
Iow lrlces Will Move to
New Iocations
New locations will be found for all
the buildings on the federal building
site, and they will be moved in a few
days by the parties who purchased
them at the auction sale held Satur
day by the Federal Site Association.
A total of $RR1.50 was realized by
the Association from the auction, and
while that amount does not begin to
represent the value of the buildings,
it will enable the association to about
break even on the deal which they
undertook several years ago in order
that Alliance's new federal building
might be located on this spot, the
corner of Box Butte and Fourth
streets.
At the time the appropriation was
made for the Alliance building, only
$15,000 of the amount was allowed
for the purchase of a site. A num
ber of locations were offered but
none seemed quite so suitable as this
one. However, the owners asked
$20,000 and held to their price, and
had it not been for a few enterpris
ing business men who made up the
difference, the building would proba
bly have been located on a Bide street.
These men who have property and
business interests wanted to see the
building on Box Butte avenue, so
they formed a local organization,
bouhgt the property for $20,000 and
sold the site to the government for
$15,000. In the meantime they have
paid the government $225 per year
for the use of the ground on which
their buildings were located and col
lected rentals from the occupants of
the buildings, and the rentals, to
gether with the amount realized from
the sale Saturday, has been sufficient
to permit them to break about even.
February 24 they received an or
der from the government to have the
ground cleared within sixty days,
This action has made it necessary for
the occupants to find new locations
and since these changes have been
made there Is not vacant business
property in the city of Alliance with
the possible exception of one or two
which are in such condition that they
are not habitable.
The two-story brick building on
the corner, occupied by Robert Pie-
ster's meat market, was sold to W.
M. Wilson for $210. Fixtures in Un
building are Haid to be worth much
more than that amount. Mr. Wilson
contemplates moving this material to
a new location on Box Butte avenm
and erecting a building to which he
will move his furniture an dhardware
store. He will probably locate on
one of the lots in the first or second
block from the depot where old
frame shacks now stand.
The next building from the corner,
a one-story cement-block structure,
occupied by the Alliance Cleaning
Works, was sold to F. E. Holsten for
$150. Mr. Holsten contemplates
moving this building to a lot owned
by him on Third street In the block
west of Box Butte avenue, and will
remodel it for a business house.
The two-story frame building for
merly occupied by Mrs. Fee's confec
tionery and Ed Jeffers' plumbing
shop was purchased by F. J. Betzold,
who will move it to his ranch near
town. P. H. Dillon, who purchased
tie other two-story frame, occupied
by W. I). Zdikr's plumbing flinji.
expects to nu.ve it to a lot in the
north part of town.
The sheds and out buildings sold
for three and four dollars each. bring
ing the total receipts from the sale
up to $551.50.
