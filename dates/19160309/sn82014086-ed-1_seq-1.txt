German Drive Northwest of Verdun.
A continuation of the German drive
northwest of Verdun is declared by
Berlin to have netted the Germans
French positions over a front of nearly
four miles and virtually two miles in
depth, and enabled them to capture 5S
officers and 3,277 men. The villages

PARTIAL BLOCKADE OF
ENGLAND BY MINES.
Now in Existence Along the
Route to Holland.
Trade
London, March 8, 6.03 p. m.
The
blockade of England by mines, re
ported as threatened by Germany, is
already in existence along the trade
route to Holland, according to naval
circles here. German submarines are
reported to have been busy recently
laying anchored mines between the
mouth of the Thames tmd the Gal
lower lightship. It is in this neigh
borhood that many disasters have oc
curred during the last month.
Passenger ships until recently have
been quite successful in dodging float
ing mines by making their voyages in
daylight, but no metrod is known of
guarding against submerged anchored
mines.
ISSUE OF FRAUDULENT
PASSPORTS HAS CEASED
Owing to Stringent Regulations In
posed by U. S. Government.
London, March 8, 6.10 p. m. The
stringent regulations put Into effect by
the American government to prevent
the Issue of fraudulent passports have
been so effective that the use of Amer
ican passports by spies in England has
virtually ceased. At the present mo
ment not a single person held in Eng
land for espionage possesses an Amer
ican passport.
Not only has it become extremely
difficult for an American without
legitimate business to obtain a pass
port, but such close track is kept of
these already Issued that spies are
unlikely to take the risk of attempting,
to enter England with a forged pass
port. SEVERE THUNDER STORM

VERDUN
In the Woevre district, southeast of
Verdun, the Germans have forced the
French to loose their hold on outlying
positions they held in the village of
Fresnes. Here, the Germans assert,
they captured 700 prisoners. In the
Meuse hills the French artillery is
counter-shelling the guns of the Ger
mans. French Capture Trenches in Alsace.
Trenches captured by the French in
upper Alsace, destructive bombard
ments of German positions at several
points north of the Aisne and the
shelling in the forest of the Argonne
are told of in the French official com
munication. Sixteen French aeroplanes
have dropped a large number of shells
on the Metz-Sablons station.
Russian Warships Active.
Russian warships are particularly
active in the Black sea, bombarding
the coast towns, and the continued
nrneress of the Russian forces is evi
denced by the capture of the town of
Riza. which lies about 35 miles east of
Trebizond, one of the important ob
iectives of the Russian army. In Per
sia, also, the Russians are forcing their
advance at a lively pace and have cap-;
tured the town of Senha (Senneh), to
the north of Keerman shah.
Artillery activity is increasing along
the Dniester river and the Bessarabian
frontier, probably presaging the re
opening of a progressive campaign.
Fifty German Warships Sighted.
Fifty large German warships, accom
panied by armed trawlers, Zeppelins
and submarines, have been sighted
steaming west off the north Holland
coast, according to the report of the
captain of a steam trawler which has
arrived at Ymuiden.
U. S. STEEL1 CORPORATION TO

New York, March 8. A new tube
plant to cost $25,000,000 will ge erect
ed at Gary, Indiana, by the United

Improvements, including ore docks,
ore yards, blast furnaces, converting
mills, blooming mills, power station,
water works, sheared plate mill, uni
versal plate mills, butt mills, job shops
and all auxiliary departments will cost
$25,000,000. It is probable the plant
will be in two units, the first of which,
it is hoped, will be completed in about
fourteen months."

ore will be moved, the statement savs.
Added to this will be 30,000,000 tons
of coal and about 14,000,000 tons of
grain.
This volume of freight is so large
that owners pf vessels, it is announced
are contemplating breaking a channel
through the ice so as to reach the
port of Escanaba, on Lake Michigan,
March 20, so as to put their ships in
commission.
The wage schodule on the lakes, the

NOMIC
- ' - SIDEOFCOAL MINING
Dealt With In Report of Special Colo
rado Coal Strike Commission.
Washington. March 8. Recommend
ation that the federal trade commission
study the economic side of coal mining
with a view to steps toward prevent
ing waste and putting the industry on
a basis giving maximum safety and
maximum steady employment is made
in the report of President Wilson's
special Colorado coal strike commis
sion. The report was sent to congress
by the president today for its informa
tion. Seth Low of New York. Charles
W. Mills of Philadelphia and Patrick
Gilday of Clearfield, Pa., composed the
commission. The commission says the
fact that all four hundred indictments
returned in Colorado in connection
with strike troubles were against
strikers, has left a "festering sore" on
public opinion.
"Some of the citizens of Colorado,"
the report comments, "believe that
many illegal acts were committed on
the part of operators and the justice
which finds all Ohe indictments on one
side does not seem to them even
handed. Your commission naturally
expressed no opinion as to the correct
ness of this belief. It simply calls at
tention to the existence of this feeling.
Again, it is believed by some, even
among the operators, that in many of
these cases the state has not sufficient
evidence to convict.
"In such cases, and your commission
believes that there are such, the men
affected are suffering from great in
justice in that flhey are either con
fined in jails, unable to get bond, or,
if out on bond, they are refused em
ployment in Colorado on account of the
indictments against them and are pre
vented from leaving Colorado or the
jurisdiction of the court by their
bondsmen.
"As long as this condition of affairs
exists, the industrial health of Colo
rado will be weakened by this fester
ing sore. It is not the business of
your commission to weigh the rights
and wrongs of the case, but we should
fall short of our duty if we did not
call attention to tihis feature of the
situation and emphasize the impor
tance to the state of providing for the
prompt remedy. Even in the interest
of public order in the long run, this
situation should be quickly ended."

GERMAN PRISONERS TELL
OF LOSSES AT VERDUN.
j Place Casualties to Infantry at Two-
Thirds of Their Total Strength.
Paris. March 8, 1 p. m. Prisoners
taken at Verdun estimate the losses
of the battalions which took part in
infantrv assaults since Februr-y 25 at
an average of two-thirds their total
strength.
"Our officers promised us." said one,
"that cannon would clear the way for
us fo that we cculd occupy the French
lines almost without loss. We be
iieved also that at each stage of our
advance new artillery preparation
would enable us to continue without
great risk. Instead my battalion un
der hard fire from field guns and ma
chine guns for hours together was cut
to pieces. The effort we made passed
all measure of human strength. That
Is why the march on Verdun failed."
A German soldier belonging to the
sixty-Fourth Infantry said: "Our bat
tallon started from its position in the
woods on the night of March 2 with
orders to occupy an earthwork east of
Fourt Douaumont. Suddenly some one
called: 'Here come the French." The
shock was so impetuous that it over
whelmed our lines. I fell into a hole
made by a shell and lay there all
night listening to the calls of the
wounded for stretcher bearers. The
moans often ended in the death rat
tle.
There can scarcely he anything left

Champions of Conservation Fought
Hard to Amend the
Without Avail.
Measure, But
Washington,
March 8. The
senate
tonight after
four weeks of
debate
passed the Shields bill to provide for
develODmet.t of water power in navi
gable waters by private capital. The
vote was 46 to 2Z. conservation
champions fought hard to amend the
measure, but without avail.
Several senators voted for the bill
who had opposed it during the debate.
One of them. Senator Walsh, said he
considered it bad legislation but firm
ly believed it would be amended when
it reached the house. Those who
voted against the bill were Senators
Ashurst, Uorah. Chamberlain. Chilton,
Cummins. Gronna, Hollis, Husting,
James, Kenyon, La Follette, Lane, Lea,
Lee, Lewis, Martine, Newlands, or
ris, Poindcxter, Heed, Sheppard and
Works.
Final Effort to Defeat Bill,
A final effort to prevent a vote on
the measure and deturn it to the com
mittee was made by Senator Husting,
whose motion to re-commit was beat
en 49 to IS. An amendment by Sen
ator Chilton requiring the secretary
of war to decide contests for permits
to build cams in favor of the appli
cant offering the lowest priced ser
vice to the public was defeated, 30 to
21
Senator Reed attacked the provision
of the bill which provides that con
tests be decided in favor of the appli
cant able to guarantee the best con
struction, declaring that this would
result in the best sites going to the
interests now operating power plants,
lie declared the measure would grant
corporations absolute control of the
country's water power for a long time.
At the end of the fifty years in
the grant." Senator Reed said, "the
government can enjoy the blessed
privilege of taking over the plants and
paying for them the full value. I be
lieve that back of this law which
would grant these enormous powers
is the same crowd that was back of
the Coosa River project in Alabama."
Continuous Debate Since Feb. 4.
The Shields bill had been under al
most continuous debate since the
passage of the Philippine bill Feb. 4.
It was opposed by the National Con
bervation Association of which Glfford
Plnchot is president. Many amend
ments were offered by a. score of sen
ators but the bill as pa sued was
changed tut little from Its; original
form.
Senator Walsh made a hard but
losing fight to obtain for the federal
government compensation for public
land withdrawn for use in dam con
struction on the basis of power ere
ated. His amendment was opposed by
Senator Sha froth and other senators
of the public land states who contend
ed that the government had no con
trol over waterways except insofar aa
concerned their navigability. S&
tor Husting and other conservation
champions sought vainly to substitute
a measure based on the Wisconsin
water power law, and retaining with
congress control or power sites. Sen
ator Newiands tried without success
to attain to the bill his measure pro
viding a waterways commission and
appropriating 60.000,000 annually for
ten years for flood control waterway
