ITEVENS-PRIGE REGULATION BILL
S OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE
About 215 members of the
lower House of Congress
have gone on record in favor
of the Stevens price-regulation
bill, and its passage ap
pears almost assured.
Notwithstanding this fact
there have been no hearings
on the bill, and the committee
on interstate and foreign af
fairs, which should be the tri
bunal fbr preliminary argu
ments; since the measure was
referred to it, has been inac
tive. The friends of the measure have
smoked out the opposition, and now
the price-cutting department stores
and mail order houses have combined
with the trading stamp people in an
open organization, and are in the fight.
This rather clears the atmosphere,
since It has been plain to the mer
chants in small towns for many years,
that the cutting of prices on nationally
advertised goods, has been a great
trick by which the business of the
small town has been drawn to the
large cities.
Price regulation, as provided for in
. the Stevens bill, is most certainly in
tha interests of the small town, the
small merchant and the consumer.
The President and the Department
of Commerce spoke out in behalf of
price regulation and protection of le
igltimate trade, fully two years ago.
Wk With Congress practically committed
the proposition, it would seem that
legislation is assured. But Congress
needs poking up a little; therefore,
people should write to their members
Make yourself a small town booster.
There is no good reason why thou
sands of dollars should be shipped out
every community each week for the
purchase of goods from mail order
houses and price-cutting department
stores, who make their big profits by
simply giving less for one's money
than the local merchant, who pays the
taxes and helps in putting his com
munity on the map.

ROBBING EDUCATION
TO BOOST WAR F
(Associated iress)
LONDON, Mar. 10. It is absurd to
talk about capturing German trade and
meeting foreign competition after the
war when so much harm is now done
to the British elementary schools in
the name of public economy, declared
Gautrey, secretary of the London
Teachers' Association in a recent in
terview.
"Education is being raided because
it is so easy to do it," he said, "but
those who are doing it have no vision
for the future welfare of the empire,
which must rest first on national ef
ficiency. A sound elementary educa
tion is the base on which all forms of
higher education must be built, espe
cially those of a more practical char
acter than are now suppiled.'
The war savings committee of the
London County Council has instruct
ed the education committee to effect
a saving of $2,000,000 in the coming
fiscal year beginning April 1. This
also means the stoppage of all build
ing projects, which in normal times
amounts to at least $2,500,000. The
county would thus save $4,500,000, on
education the next school year.
Mr. Gautery says it is not shown
how this saving would aid the war,
and implies that it only eases the bur
den of the taxpayers.

AMERICAN TROOPS TOLD TO CATCH VILLA
(Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 10. President Wilson
ordered American troops over the Mexican border
to capture or kill V&a and his bandits, who yesterday-raided
Columbus, N. M. Major General Scott
has announced that the expedition will consist of
not less than 5,000 men, all of whom are already cn
the border, under the command of General Funston.
WASHINGTON, Mar. 10.
After an early conference
this morning, between secre
tary of war Baker and Major
General Scott, it was an
nounced that the Columbus
massacre was a closed inci
dent as far as the war de
partment was concerned.
Gen. Scott said that unless
it was decided to have the
American troops cross the
border again, there was no
likelihood that any further
action would be taken by the
army.
Gen. Funston, in an over
night disoatch urgently rec
ommended that he be outhor-
ized to send troops over the
border to finally clean out all
bandit gangs. The State De
partment passed on this rec
ommendation.
At the State Department it
was made plain that while the
incident was closed tor the
present by the War Depart
ment, it was not closed as tar
as the U. S. government was
concerned, as negotiations
with Carranza for permission
to send troops would go for
ward at once.
The Cabinet Talks and Acts
(Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 10.
(11.14 a. m.) As President
Wilson laid his data of the
Mexican situation before his
cabinet there were strong in
dications that all members
strondv favored sending an
American force across the
SOUTHWEST t'f
MARCH 9, 1916.

border to clean up the Villa
bandits.
It is the desire of the gov
ernment to accomplish that
without precipitating a con
troversy, and tor this reason
Carranza will be a strong fac
tor in whatever decision ,is
reached.
The administration officials,
were far from disapproving of
the pursuit of Villa yesterday
by American troops; they
praised the action, and ex
pressed regret that Villa was
not taken.
The cabinet decided that
the Villa bandits must be
caught even if the American
troops have to go atter him.
President Wilson s order to
go after vVilla, in its present
form, does not mean armed
intervention in Mexico; it
provides for a punitive expe
dition to deal with the lawless
forces over which Carranza
soldiers had no control. The
statement issued by the
White House reads:
"An adequate force will be
sent at once in pursuit of
Villa with the single object of
capturing him and putting a
stop to his forays. This can
be done entirely by friendly
aid by the constituted author
ities of Mexico, with scrupu
lous respect for sovereignty
of the republic."
It is said at the White
House that the American gov
ernment wants Villa dead or
alive ; no steps will be neg-

An account of recent activities of
the Rood School Parent-Teachers' As
sociation of the Yuma project will ex
cite the envy of people located in more
rigorous climates, for all winter they
have had the most wonderful out-of-doors
neighborhood meetings in the
willow grove of the school grounds.
Their Christmas frolic and tree ex-,
ercises were held on the grounds, and
as the night was cool huge bonfires
were lighted, which were an attractive
addition to the novel celebration.
.This association. does, not confine its
activities entirely to exclusively school
matters. They have furnished money
and supplies to a needy family in their
midst, and are initiating "a movement-
for co-operation - in the handling of
farm produce.
The Yuma Women's Ocotillo Club
has purchased a , piece of property on
which they propose to erect .a club
house in the near future. The Ocotillo
Club is one of the strongest organiza
tions in Yuma, and their club rooms
will be a credit to the city.
Yuma Valley has been the scene of
destructive floods. With the city levee
broken, the Gila's muddy flood swept
through the business streets of Yuma
and left a trail of ruin and destruction.
Hundreds were rendered homeless and
without food. Business was at a
standstill for days. Did you read the
reports from Yuma? We hope you did,
for they carried a note of courage and
hope so inspiring and thrilling that
every patriotic American should bt
proud to claim kinship with these
brave folks of the valley of the Ameri
can Nile.
Yuma people asked no alms for her
distressed and homeless. Yuma's
great heart opened wide, and the
stricken and hungry were housed and
fed. A noble band cf Yuma women,
in the dark hours which tried men's
souls, did their full share. With food
and clothes, with lodging and minister
ing hands to the afflicted, they gave
unselfishly and without stint. Great
disasters always knit a community
closer together, and in these troublous
times Yuma has been as one family.
Out of the wrecks of the old adobe
structures, which crumbled like ashes
in the flood, modern buildings will
quickly rise, and a better and more
beautiful city will smke again beneath
the cloudless skies- of the wonderful
valley. It is worth while to suffer
sometimes just to bring out again
those splendid qualities of unselfish
and tender solicitude. Yuma is not
despondent. Yuma Is even now at
work making a new and better . city.
This weather tempts one to take
them off, but the calendar says that
it is way too early and a certain
amount of mental seesawing takes
place every morning early when one
puts the first foot out of bed.
It may sometimes happen that one
time is better than another t oinsist

In the case of Louis Alexander,
:harged with liquor selling, the jury
disagreed, and the defendant was dis
charged. The jury that tried the case
were J. B. Marrs, William Wright, G.
?. Rose, Drain Quick, O. H. Crane,
Oscar C. Luzier, CP. Cooper, W. G.
j ones, Joel Berry, J. P. Hunt, Charles
J. Johnson and James F. Meek.
It was a hotly contested case, the
defendant having four attorneys, Tim
mons, Harris, Ford .and Pierce Evans.
Alexander was accused of having sold
whiskey to Frank M. Hodges, Jr., Gus
Coutreras, Julius Levy and Onofre
Daniel at the Yuma theatre on last
Thanksgiving evening. The plaintiff
contended that the whiskey was sold
to the boys named, who made up a
purse of 2 with which they paid for it.
Julius Levy and Frank M. Hodges,
Jr., testified for the state, stating that
they received a bottle of whiskey from
Young Alexander according to the com
plaint, and that he was paid $2 for the
same.
, The defendant placed no witnesses
on the stand. Attorney Timmons con
tended in his argument that Alexander
was only an-agent for some one else,
in procuring the liquor, and that as
agent he was not violating any law.
Judge Baxter instructed the jury
that if they found by the evidence that
, the defendant had either sold, or gave
jaway, or acted as agent in procuring
j the, booze he should be found guilty.
