law. and at the same time there was only a slight increase in
the number of towns voting to grant licenses. There appear
to bo 2:) this year, against 20 last year. Many "lily-white"
towns that have never granted licenses voted heavily against
the proposed prohibitory law, Hvattlcboro, with a majority of

larger towns in the State, Burlington went, wet by .'Ml, as
against 25 last year. Rutland went wet, two to one, and
Barre gave a majority of 10:5 for license. Montpelier went
"dry" by 58 majority.
