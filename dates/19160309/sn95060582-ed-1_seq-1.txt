RANK FOOLISHNESS
You occasionally see it stated
that colds do not result from
cold weather. That i s rank
foolishness. Were it true colds
would be as prevalent in mid
summer as in midwinter. The

ishes in damp, cold weather. To
get rid of a cold take Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy, 1 1 i s
effectual and is highly- recom
mended by people who have used
it for many years as occasion re-
quired, and know its real value. -
Obtainable everywhere.

make it perfectly waterproof.
The building proper will be two
stories high and 65x100 feet with
a solid glass front, the walls to be
built of stone. The interior will
