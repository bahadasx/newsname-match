day to attend the cattle men's
convention. The town and coun
try round about seemed almost
depopulated. Long strings of
automobiles from further east

Tuesday bound for the same des
tination. To signalize the meeting of
stockmen in Albuquerque, the
Herald of that place issued an
extra edition of four sections
containing a complete review of
thb live stock industry of New
Mexico. It was a fine example
of newspaper enterprise, and
good work technically in all de
partments. County Agent Roland Harwell
left last Friday evening to spend
a few days at the government
experimental dry farm at Tucum-
cari. It is understood that those
in charge of that station have
worked out successful dry farm
methods, and Mr. Harwell's ob
ject in making the trip was to
acquaint himself with the meth
ods pursued there, which be will
in turn impart to the dry farmers
of Torrance county. He will
also take note of the crops raised
there, and bring back with him
seed of different varieties. Un
doubtedly this trip will result in
benefit to the farmers of this
county. The Rock Island rail
road company issued Mr. Har
well a pass to enable him to make
this trip. Our readers all under
stand, of course, that the N. M
C. not only issues him a pass but
contributes to the fund for pay-
his salary and expenses.

POLITICAL
ANNOUNCEMENTS
We are receiving these days
sundry marked copies of news
papers and circulars and phamph
lets setting forth the reasons why
sundry gentlemen therein named
should be elected to sundry of
fices therein specified, even up
to president of the United States.
The fact that the claims of these
sundry gentlemen are not set
forth at large in the columns of
the News-Herald is not due to
any grouch or feeling of hostility
toward any of those who desire
to serve their country in public
office. The desire to hold office
is a laudable ambition and we
have no objections to it But we
have no space to donate for fur
thering the political aspirations
of any man or set of men. The
columns of the paper are open to
any and all to whatever extent
may be desired at a very reason
able charge, and all who desire
to avail themselves of this
privilege may feel assured of ab
solutely fair treatment. Calls
for caucuses and conventions and
announcement of meetings will
be published without charge
when copy is furnished, as such
are of general interest and there
fore have a news value. Other
wise there will be exceedingly
little of a political nature in these
columns, which will be devoted
as heretofore to giving the local
news of the county, and to say
ing whatever may be said honest
ly to promote the general inter
ests of the people of the county.

There are five stations in Tor
rance county where a complete
weather record was kept during
December and January Tor
rance, Willard, Estancia, Rea's
Ranch on Bosca Mountain, and
Harry Bigger's ranch near Mori-

fall considerably heavier than
the average. For the two
months the snowfall ' at these
stations was as follows: Tor
rance, 20 inches; Willard, 14.1
inches; Estancia, 23.3 inches;
Rea's Ranch, 112.5 inches; Big

feet; Willard, 6,086 feet; Estan
cia, 6,140; Kea's Kanch, 9,820
feet; Bigger's Ranch, 6.204 feet.

different parts of the county on
the same date. In December
the lowest temperature at Tor
rance was 3 above on the 28th;
at Willard, 16 below; at Estancia,
14 below; at Rea's Ranch, 6 be

the temperature record was not
kept at Torrance. The lowest at

the 31st. The highest at Willard
was 61 on the 9th; at Estancia 64
on the 8th; at Rae's Ranch 46 on
the 4th.
There was very little snowfall
in the valley during February,
