BETTER BABY
PROOtAM WAS
IMG
PLAYLET BY CHILDREN—SENSI­
BLE TALKS BY DOCTORS
PENCE, McCANNEL AND HARTL
—GOOD MUSICAL NUMBERS.
A large crowd attended the "Better
Baby" program at the Presbyterian
church Monday evening. Rev. P. W.
Erickson, who presided at the meet­
ing, complimented the women's clubs,
having the work in charge.
Mrs. E. S. Person, one of Minot's
most talented pipe organists, played
two selections in a manner that was
highly pleasing. Mrs. R. E. Barron,
one of the city's favorite soloists, sang
two appropriate selections.
The playlet, "Why the germs found
another home," was given by children
under the direction of Miss Eula Mil­
ler. This was one of the most inter­
esting numbers of the program.
Dr. Pence spoke on "Infectious and
Contagious Diseases," saying, that
some of the diseases, particularly
measles, are not to be so greatly fear­
ed, as the complications that some­
times arise. He warned mothers nev­
er to expose a child to a contagious di­
sease, thinking the child must take it
sooner or later.
Dr. Hartl spoke on the care of the
mouth. He mentioned the great work
done along pure food lines, but said
that not enough attention was paid to
clean mouths. In New York City an
inspection showed that there were
9600 pupils with decayed teeth and
their efficiency was improved 90 per
cent when their teeth had received at­
tention.
Dr. Archie McCannel said that Bet­
ter Baby work really started in Paris
30 years ago when Dr. DuBown insti­
tuted a free consultation for mothers.
He said the keynote of the medical
profession is prevention rather than
cure that 98 per cent of the ear di­
seases are due to diseased condition of
the nose and throat. There are over
300,000 blind people in the United
States. Ninety, pier cent of this bKndr
riess ia due to infant opthalmia, which
could be prevented, and to neglect of
school children. He condemned sling
shot and air rifles, the latter, .being
the worst ^'actidental" destroyed i«f
sight in existence. He said there
should be a law preventing the manu­
facture of the. air rifle. j*|'|

DIES FROM IMS
WESTERN EXPRESS CO.'S NIGHT
MAN SUFFERED FATAL IN­
JURY SUNDAY WHEN HIS MO­
TORCYCLE COLLIDED WITH AN
AUTOMOBILE.
A terrible accident occurred on East
Central avenue at the corner of
Third street at 4:30 o'clock Sunday
afternoon, resulting in the death Wed­
nesday night of Herbert Franklyn,
night expressman of the Western Ex­
press Co. Mr. Franklin was riding
his motorcycle north on Third street
at quite a rapid pace and turned to go
west on Central avenue, when his ma­
chine collided with an auto driven by
Mrs. R. N. Allen, who was driving
east on Central avenue in company
with two friends. Mr. Franklin's left
leg struck the front spring of the car
with such terrific force that the bones
below the knee were crushed to a pulp.
He was taken at once to St. Joseph's
hospital, where he was made as com­
fortable as possible. The bones were
set the following day in hopes that the
leg might possibly be saved, but blood
poisoning set in Tuesday and that af­
ternoon the leg was amputated just
below the knee. He was very weak
from the shock, and blood poisoning
setting in, he declined rapidly Wed­
nesday. During the afternoon he con­
tinued to fail and several hours before
death, the doctors had given up all
hopes of saving the young man's life.
He passed away at 9:40 o'clock Wed­
nesday evening.
Mrs. Allen states that she was driv­
ing on the right side of the street at
the rate of about six miles an hour.
On account of the icy condition of the
street, she kept her car towards the
middle of the street. She says the
rider of the motorcycle came around
the corner, taking the short turn and
that she tried to steer her car to the
left in order to let him pass. As she
did so, the two machines came to­
gether. She declares that he was
riding at a rapid pace. There are sev­
eral eye witnesses to substantiate her
story. Mrs. Allen has handled cars
for several years and is regarded as
a very cool-neaded driver, who is_ able
to control her machine at all times.
She states that she brot her car to
such a sudden stop that the engine
was killed instantly.
Immediately after the accident hap­
pened, Mrs. Allen backed her car out
and carried the injured man to the
hospital. The accident is regretted
by everybody and especially by Mrs.
Allen, who is inconsolable.
Herbert Franklin was born at East
Grand Forks, Nov. 27,1895, coming to
'•ic't-!
.'i', i"..'
:'.vvS
W'V-"Ni|-.A
Minot with his mother about fourteen
years ago.
For several years he had been em­
ployed by the Western Express Co.,
where he worked his way up by his
faithfulness to his duties and the ex­
treme courtesy he showed all patrons.
He was a member of Co. and was
considered one of the best members of
the organization. Herbert was a
young man exceedingly popular with
his associates. He was honest and in­
dustrious and manly in every way. He
is survived by his mother, Mrs. A.
Franklin, a brother, Thomas, employ­
ed at the Leland Department Store,
and a sister, Miss Florence, who is at­
tending the Normal school.
Short funeral services were held at
Van Fleet's undertaking parlors this
afternoon, and the remains were taken
to Grafton, N. D. that aternoon, where
they were buried beside those of his
father.
Last Monday Herbert told a friend
all about the accident. He declared
that he was partially to blame. He
said that had there been a stake in
the center of the square where he
made the turn, he would just about
have struck the stake. He declared
that the driver of the car was driving
in about the center of the street, but
that when he turned to go to the right,
the driver turned to the left, appar­
ently expecting that he would make
the short turn.
Owing to conflicting stories in exist­
ence concerning the tragedy, Coroner
Orson Doe ana the State's Attorney
decided on holding an inquest, which
was begun this afternoon. The jury
consists of J. A. Roell, Ernie Tomp­
kins and W. E. Mansfield.

PARTMENT RECOMMENDS A
FIRE HALL FOR NORTH SIDE.
State Fire Marshal A. H. Runge
sent a communication to the city com­
mission, urging them to buy addition­
al equipment or the fire department.
He refers to the recent Roell-Blakey
fire and says that the firemen are to
be commended for the good work they
did, considering the equipment.
He says in part:
"I am surprised that there were not
injuries reported from the Roell-Blak­
ey fire, as part of the walls were found
to be only four-inch brick with eight
inch hollow tile and yet they will crit­
icise a chief for failing to save the
building. If a building of that size and
character was afire in either St. Paul
or Minneapolis, instead of a handful of
men, there would be at least ten en­
gine companies of nine men each,
three truck companies of eleven men,
a water tower and about one-half do.z
en turret nozzles working, all this
equipment under orders of at least
three chiefs, without the aid of side­
walk chiefs.
"This department, knowing the con­
ditions of both your water and fire de­
partments extends its compliments to
the heads of both for the very efficient
work done on January 11th and would
recommend that each and every re­
quest made to you by Chief O'Leary
be granted. Also that consideration
be given the matter of purchasing a
site on the north side of the Great
Northern tracks and a firehall erected,
Also that consideration be given, fag
installation of a high pressure system.
Look into the future and be prepared:"
Miss Mabel Harris of Des Lacs
Miss Mabel Harris,, the 18-year-oll

one. She was loYq&.aotf admired by

THE HOME OF HER SISTER AT
ALEXANDER—FUNERAL HELD
AT SURREY SUNDAY.
Obituary.
Emma Cornelia Van Ostrand was
born at Weyauwega, Wis., July 9,
1849, and resided with her parents
near Rural, Wis., until the year 1873,
when she was united in marriage to
George Wetmore and removed to Ne­
braska, where they lived 21 years and
where all of their seven children were
born. In 1902 they came to North
Dakota and resided at Surrey several
years, later moving to Laurens, Iowa,
where their home now is. Last fall
they came to North Dakota to visit
their children and in November Mrs.
Wetmore went to Alexander, N. D.,
to visit hefc sister, Mrs. Mary Cooper.
She had only been there a short time
until she ifras taken quite sick and
kept failing until she was removed to
I the hospital, where she had the best
icare and medical attention, but with
out avail, and where she passed away
the morning of Feb. 29, 1916. She
was converted when sixteen years of
age and lived a consecrated Christian
the rest of her life, attaining a deep
experience in Christian grace. She
composed many beautiful hymns, some
of which were set to music.
Her daughter who was with her in
her last hours, took her remains to
Surrey, where she was interred. She
leaves to mourn her loss a loving hus­
band, three sons, three daughters,
three sisters, one brother, nine grand­
children and many friends.
,Tlje following is one of her poems
which her children prize very highly:
"IT IS FINISHED."
"'Tis finished! the work Thou gavest
me
Is done Thy voice I have obeyed.
Justice was met, and on the tree,
For you for me, He died.
"'Tis finished! Yes, on Calvary,
Redemption's work was done.
Stern justice yields to Mercy's plea
And Love doth sit enthroned.
I
"'lis finished! He died He rose again
Arid triumphed o'er the gra-vi
That you and I from sin's dark stain
Forever might be saved.
1 1
"'Tis .finished. But will all this avail
If offered mercy we'refuse?
Redemption's work for us will fail
And W^Hfithbttt excuse."
E. C. W.
fThe funeral was held at the Breth
erni! chjijfql^, at Surrey Sunday after­
noon at .Sk o'clock, Rev. Clymer of­
ficiating. -The obsequies were delayed
from Saturday until Sunday, on ac­
count of the husband, who was at the
Old Soldier's Home in South Dakota,
not being able to reach Surrey sooner.
LOGAN MURMURS. S
'$$ $ $ $ $ S $
The directors of the Logan Hall as­
sociation are to be congratulated on
the successful series of dances recent­
ly inaugurated. Oard's six-piece or­
chestra has discoursed sweet music in
manner finished, and the management
are deserving of much credit for the
perfect order which has prevailed. The
floor, which is of hard maple, is in ex
cellent shape and Logan has reason
to be proud of a record which has
proved beyond question that it is pos­
sible to eliminate any and every ob
jectionable feature from a public
I dance.
Mrs. Russell Oard and Mrs. D. E.
Ross were Sawyer visitors on Wednes
day last.
The Samaritan Ladies Aid were the
guests of Mrs. Reuben Stredwick- on
Thursday. Many members and friends
enjoyed the hospitality of our pioneer
friends, much useful work was really
accomplished and a pleasant visit was
brought to a close by the serving of a
luncheon dainty and delicious.
Mrs. Tilton entertained the mem
bers of the Latter Day Aid from morn
till eve, on Thursday. This proved to
be one of the most pleasing social
functions of the season.
Miss Iola Horning, who has been
spending the wintry months within
the Heavenly sphere, was welcomed on
her return to Logan by a host of ad­
miring friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Carl Ross, who are
now resident several miles south of
Minot, were enjoying the many attrac­
tions of our city on Wednesday.
Miss W. Bean, our popular postmis­
tress, and Mr. Cale Bean were among
the many who were disappointed by
the non-arrival of the much advertis­
ed Gold car. Hotel accommodation
within the windy city is apt to be
somewhat draughty, whenever any­
thing is doing.
Mr. Packard of N. prairie, who re­
cently sold his farm at an encourag­
ing figure, was a visitor on Wednes­
day, arranging with out local repre­
sentative for a comprehensive sale
bill. Mr. Packard, whose announce­
ment appears elsewhere, is among
those who have demonstrated that Lo­
gan soil, well farmed, is a wealth pro­
ducing combination.- The sale on the
20th is a genuine dispersal of stock
and effects.
Mrs. David-Forbes left last week on
a visit to her daughter at Kincorth,

helpmeet of the hustler who has res­
urrected Sawyer, is, we are pleased to
learn, rapidly gaining strength and
is expected to return from Rochester,
Minn., the latter part of the week.
Fred Willman was a visitor during
the week, arranging for the prelimi­
nary work in connection with the ex­
tensive improvements contemplated
on his farm lands just east of .town.
Misfortunes, we are told, seldom
come singly, and, the truth of this
adage is emphasized by news of a
painful accident which recently befell
Mrs. H. C. Kuchenbecker. While in
Minot, submitting to a course of
treatment, she had the misfortune to
fall on a slippery sidewalk and
twist her wrist, and suffer a severe
shakeup. The good lady is progress­
ing favorably, however.
Olaf Lokensgard, our popular com­
missioner, was a business visitor on
Wednesday.
Miss Cora Mackie from Minot and
Mrs. Clarence Mackie's sister from
Dubuque, Iowa, are enjoying a pleas­
ing visit on S. prairie.
Mr. and Mrs. Will Sillman were be­
tween train visitors to the Wonder
City on Thursday and Friday.
Mrs. Gus. Silman of S. Prairie, was
among those who took in the great
Auto Show during the week.
Martin Skov has given a practical
demonstration of what a Ford will ac­
complish on North Dakota roads dur
ing the worst winter months, being an
almost daily visitor to our interesting
town, where he has a host of friends.
Freemont Cook, of Holstein fame,
has been sadly under the weather of
late and is still patiently submitting
to medical experiment. Freemont is
a busy man at all seasons, and1 his
farm is among the best examples of
successful diversification.
We are glad to note that our good
neighbors at Tasker are making an ef­
fort to establish a Farmers' elevator.
It should be useful as a landmark, to
determine just where Tasker is.
Burlington enjoys the eccentricity
of a bachelors' club with quite an im­
posing membership. One respected
but loveless native wandered with in­
sufficient escort to the Heavenly
Sphere, hotel accommodation is pain­
fully limited at intervals, and the gen­
tleman was finally located at an es­
tablishment presided over by a good
lady, who caters especially for the
needs of the sweet daughters of Eve,
who tend the sick and suffering. A
charming nurse is hard to resist sev­
eral will play havoc with a bachelor's
best resolutions. When those ladies
got wise, imagination will suggest
what a dainty, delicate, yet deliberate
roasting Burlington's stray bachelor
^enjoyed.
.There will be a select dance at the
new Logan Hall on Friday, March
17th.. Some maliciously disposed in­
dividual has circulated a report that
a rough element is permitted at these
functions, but Logan brands a^ abso­
lutely false any.such infeitfUatibn, 'and
prides herself "oft the 'good beh'avior'-Grf

Loftus, of Minneapolis, who went to
St. Petersburg, Fla., several weeks
ago in an attempt to recuperate from
his long seige of illness in a Minne­

that he is very much stronger.
Mr. Loftus underwent treatment for

Burlington Man for Presidential
Elector.
The many friends of John Werner,
of Burlington, will be interested in
learning that his name will appear on
the ballots of the state for presidential
republican elector. Mr. Werner has
never played politics very extensively.
He has given his attention to farm­
ing and banking, but if he is as suc­
cessful as a politician as he is as a
businessman, he will go along some.

Expensive Fight for McHenry County
Farmer.
Matt Mettson, a McHenry county
farmer, was awarded a verdict for
$1500 against his neighbor, John H.
Jones, for a beating tne plaintiff had
sustained at his hands. The men had
trouble over some cattle that had been
trespassing and when Mettson went
to the Jones farm to effect a settle­
ment, he was severely beaten. Mett­
son brot suit for damages thru his
attorney, M. O. Eide of Minot, assisted
by Atty. C. B. Davis, also of Minot.
Chet Harris Guilty.
Chet Harris, charged with stealing
dressed hogs from the Wm. Parker
farm north of town, was found guilty
in district court.
FORMER PRESIDENT OF CITI­
ZENS BANK, WHO WAS AC­
QUITTED OF EMBEZZLEMENT,
The plaintiff alleges that he was
wrongfully detained by an officer in
Minneapolis, being deprived of his lib­
erty a long time that he was incar­
cerated in jail for thirty hours and
was afterwards brot to Minot in
charge of the sheriff of Ward county.
He alleges that he was harrassed, vex­
ed and injured and was injured and
damaged both physically and mental­
ly and was exposed to great shame,
humiliation and disgrace.
Peter Ehr, the defendant in the ac­
tion, is one of the best known citizens
in Ward county and one of the strong­
est financially. He has employed Brad­
ford & Nash to defend him. While
Mr. Ehr does not believe in trying his
case in the newspapers, he states that
he is certain that when the case comes
to trial, he will be able to show up
some features that he was unable to
show at the former trial, by reason of
Mr. Kemper's being kept off the wit­
ness stand. The result of the action
will be watShed with considerable in­
terest.

WARD COUNTY THRESHERMEN
START BALL ROLLING FOR A
STATE-WIDE MOVEMENT
FINE BANQUET HELD.
Forty-seven sat down to a fine ban­
quet given by the Ward County
Threshermen's Association at the P.
and L. Cafeteria this evening.
Ward county has the distinction of
having the only threshermen's organ­
ization in North Dakota and at the
meeting this evening a committee
composed of John M. Rohe, John Un
derdahl and W. G. Hancock was ap­
pointed to take steps towards forming
a state threshermen's organization.
After the banquet, an interesting
program of toasts was given, Wm.
Stevens, of the firm of Hancock &
Stevens, Rumely dealers, acting as
toastmaster. Among those who spoke
were Atty. Sibbald, August Hanson,
of Fargo, manager of the Case Co. for

Korsland and County Commissioner
Rohe of Kenmare Marius Erickson,
manager of the Minot branch of the
Case Co. Mike Donovan of Williston
A. M. Johnson and W. C. Hancock of

The threshermen in organizing,
have for their aim mutual benefit for
themselves and farmers in coping with
the riff-raff labor. They hope to es­
tablish uniform prices thruout the
state and add dignity to the business
in general.
Percy Hancock, son of W. G. Han­
cock, delighted the audience with sev­

burned to death, in a fire which de­
stroyed the farm home. The victim
and his nine-year-old brother were
lighting a kerosene lamp which ex­
ploded. The victim, with his clothing
aflame, rushed up the stairs, which
made it impossible for the mother to
save him. The other boy was badly
burned, but will live. The body of the
victim was found charred in the ruins
I of the home.

BRINGS SUIT FOR LARGE SUM.
H. H. Kemper, formerly president
of the Citizens Bank of this city, thru
his attorneys, Halvor L. Halvorson
and E. R. Sinkler, has started an ac­
tion in the district court of Ward coun­
ty, for $110,000, against Peter Ehr,
I the present president of the bank. The
alleged grounds for damage are two
I arrests of the plaintiff in the damage
case, at the instigation of the defend­
ant, as he alleges, charging him with
embezzlement. Kemper was acquitted
of both charges when the case came
to trial in the district court some time
ago.
The county insanity board, after
giving the question a thorough inves­
tigation, decided that A. B. Britton,
who was arrested some time ago on a
charge of committing a loathsome
crime, and who Was turned over to the
insanity board for consideration by the
state's attorney and.police, was not in­
sane. He is still held under the orig­
inal criminal charge and is out on bail.
He is receiving treatment foriiris'sup-''
posed malady.
