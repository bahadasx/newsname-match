Mistake of Crown Prince
Has Doomed Success of
Verdun Flank Attack
By . Issociatcd rress
Paris, March !•. The oflicial state
ment published last night has done
much to relieve the tension which had
been caused in the public mind by the
expectation of a great onslaught on
the mam French defenses on the west
bank of the Meuse. Press and public
are now more than ever convinced
that the Germans will not be able to
take Verdun.
Military observers express the be
lief that the Germ'ans originally in
tended a frontier attack on Verdun,
which was to be accompanied by two
flank attacks, one in the Woevre not
meant to be pushed home, and the
other on the west bank of the Meuse
which might develop into the main
attack. Desiring, however, to justify
a premature announcement of the
capture of Douaumont, the Crown
Prince kept 200,000 men on the right

"REFORM" POOR

President Loudermilch Tolls
Mow Former Directorate
Labeled Inmates
"Under the 'reform' policies of the
former poor board, the unfortunates
at the county almshouse were never
allowed to forget for a moment that
they were paupers—that is, if they
1 didn't want, to go trouserless."
President Fernando Loudermilch
made that cryptic observation yester
day in discussing the curious methods
I employed by his predecessors in car-
I ing for the poor of the county.
The story of the heritage of trousers
was unearthed by the poor directors
, during a recent visit to the almshouse
following the general and thorough
■ "clean-up" made at the urgent, order
of inspectors of the State Department
of Health.

IMMENSE REALTY DEAL
May Be Joint Move With De

lon Mills
I -
| Persistent rumors of an immense 1
real estate deal said to involve the
I sale of many properties in the West ,
Side of Steelton and a large tract of j
land between the borough and liar- i
rlsburg, were current this morning.
, The ground, according to the re-:
I ports, is to be used either as the site 1
] for big railroad yards for the Phila
; delpliia & Reading Railway Co., or for
| the proposed expansion of the Penn- !
| sylvania Steel Works.
While none of the persons interest
ied in the reported deal would shed
j any light upon the rumors, it was;
I intimated that the Reading lias plans]
for yard expansion to enable it to
make a strong bid for greater freight j
shipments from this rapidly growing I,
manufacturing center.
After Freight Business
It has been known for some, time
jthet the Reading is going after freight
] business from this section with re-
I newed vigor and attention was called j
I to the advertisements now being dis-;
j tributed hereabouts by the Reading
j Railroad, pointing out its facilities for
| shipping from Harrisburg to all large j
! trade centers. That the reported deal j
;is the forerunner of big railroad
i yards between Harrisburg and Steel
-1 ton was intimated.
j Since the steel trade has entered its
; present period of war-time activity
shipments from the steel works have
taxed to the utmost the facilities of
the railroads entering the plant. The
1 cnnsylvnnia is now endeavoring to
get permission from the Steelton
council lor constructing a new freight
i spur with siding through the borough
and the Reading recently improved its
tracks throug.ii the lower end of the
city. In the light of these htings, such
a deal as' rumored to-day, would not
be unexpected, especially since tin-
Schwab interests are planning to still
greater increase the output of the big
steel works.

>j "From bridge steel to shrapnel," is
J the title of the last, chapter in the

j steel which long has stood the knocks

of passenger and freight trains, will
, be flying through the air in the war

ing bodies, and even destroying cathe
-1 drals, perhaps.
Announcement was made to-day

rarily because of the unsatifactory

The action was decided upon fol
lowing a conference between the Bu

No definite action was taken on the

Relieved to have been led by Francisco Villa attacked this town
i early to-day, killed five American soldiers and fully a dozen civilans,

United States troops on American soil.
The Mexicans were driven from the town after a struggle last

art' said to have crossed into Mexico. More tHan fifty Mexicans were
killed, according to reports received here just before noon.
Colonel Slocuin, commander of the American troops at Colum

I he Mexican fell dead a second later, shot through the head bv a

have been a stroke by Villa to force intervention in Mexico, lie
