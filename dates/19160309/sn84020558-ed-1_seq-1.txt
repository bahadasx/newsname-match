' Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON. March 8. .Mittcrnos:;
marked the reply of A. J. Balfour,
first lord of the admiralty, in the
house of commons today to Colonel
Winston Spencer Churchill's attack on
the naval administration which the
first lord said was unfortunate, both
in form and substance and likely to
arouse misgivings among the people.1
While deprecating "the controversy, I
Mr. Palfonr declared: "I absolutely
deny Colonel Churchill's charges." j
He then threw the blame on Colonel
Churchill for depleting, the ranks of
skilled shipwrights by allowing them
to join the army during Churchill's'
tenure of office, thus hindering the
shipbuilding plans which, however, the
government had succeeded in keeping
abreast with the needs. !
"If the fleets at, the command of i
his country at this moment are not
suffirieni to secure safety, then in
the whole history of Great Bhitain
they never have been," was one of
the parting shots uttered by Mr. Bal
four. Colonel Churchill retorted with a
brief speech, repeating ht.s doubts
about the execution of the battleship
nnd destroyer program and asserting
that even now Mr. Balfour had not
given any assurance on this point. He
admitted there was no reason to sup
pose that the British margin of
strength was not sufficient, . but he
thought the greatest efforts should J
be made to build at the highest speed.
Other members protested against
such contest in the house of com
mons and James M. Hogge. radical,
for East Edinburgh, criticised Colonel
Churchill for starting a controversy
which couuld not lie- easily stopped.
A number of other departments of
admiralty activity, ouch as requisi
tioning merchant shipping, arming of
merchantmen and air defense, were
mibjected to discussion, but the com
mittee of tlie house eventually ap
proved a vote for 350,1100 men for the
navy and several 'token" appropri
ations for navy expenditures, which
bad been introduced in this manner
to avoid giving total amounts.
Tilers are many evidences of a
highly ch-trged political atmosphere
as a result of Colonel Winston Spen
cer C'.iiirehi"s sensational reappeat
anee in the house of commons Tues
day and the equally sensational re
Ply to Colonel Churchill made by
Arthur J. Balfour, first ioid of the
aomiralty-.
"Is Colonel Churchill preparing to
return to politics?" Is the question
on many lips. Yesterday he attended
n meeting of a self-appointed com
mittee of liberals who suggested to
him that h- ought to come back into
the parliamentary forum. Colonel
Churchill replied, according to those
present, with a speech criticising the.
work of the present admiralty, and
said he was "gravely considering"
what course it was his duty to pur
sue Colonel Churchill's intentions in this
respect are of such importance that
the morning newspapers show reluc
tance to hazard any guesses, although

road employes, involving every road in
the country, or 52S different lines, on
the question of demanding an eight
hour day with time and a half for over
time, will not be made until tomor
row or Friday. The vote of the men
is said to be overwhelmingly in favor
of demanding a shorter day with pay j
ror overtime wnen tne present wage
agreements expire March 31. The tak
ing of the vote has been in progress
by mail for several months.
Officers of the engineers, firemen
conductors and trainmen organizations
met here today to tabulate the vote
and consider plans for presenting the
demands of the men to the railroads.
The union leaders were in conference
behind closed doors all day. but said
no announcement of the result of the
vote would be made within forty-eight
hours. Those present were:
W. S Stone, grand chief of the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Enginemen; W.

Railway Trainmen;' W. S. Carter, pres
ident of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Firemen and Enginemen: A. B.

tut secretary of the executive commit
tee. '
' V. G. Lee. president of the Brother
hood of Railway Trainmen, said: I
"There is little question that the vote
will be in favor of the eight-hour day
and for immediate action. If that is
the case, the railroads will be notified
that the men demand an ebjht-hour
day, and they will be given thirty day
in which to prepare their reply. If the
cKmar.ds are refused, our hext step
will be to call for a referendum strike
vote and negotiations will be begun
with the railroads. There is a pros
pect of a strike, but there are many
conditions which may arise between
I he present and the final calling out
of the men which may prevent such
action." '

Hawaii, was mentally competent
when, several years ago, she exe

her property to three trustees, headed
by the late Samuel ( leghorn, father of

The decision was rendered in a
suit brought by her nephew, Jonah
Kuhio Kalanianaole. better known as
Prince Cupid, delegate to congress
from Hawaii, to have the trust deed
dissolved on the ground that the for
mer queen was mentally unsound
when she executed it.
Cupid brought suit as Liliuokalani's
"next best friend." The court denied
his right to bring the suit and de
cided that the former queen was pre
sumably sane and competent.
The deed of trust gave the trustees
absolute and irrevocable control over

WASHINGTON, March 8. Today
Germany made a further explanation
to the L'nited States of the position
it has taken in regard to armed mer
chant vessels of the entente allies.
Count von Pernstorff handed Secre
tary Lansing a formal memorandum
vvhi'-h. after reviewing the events lead
ing up to Germany's recent decision
to treat armed merchant ships as aux
iliary cruisers, conceded that existing
international law does not regulate the
use ot submarines, indicated a willing
ness to conduct undersea warfare in
accordance with the law prevailing at
the oinbreak of the war, providing
Great P.ritain and her allies would re
gard the same laws, and expressed the
hope that the people of the United
States, remembering the long existing1
friendly relations between the two na
tions, would appreciate the German po
sition. The memorandum was submitted to
President Wilson shortly after its re
ceipt. It will be considered, together
with other documents from the Ger
man government, in determining what
shall he the next step of the X'niteil
States in the submarine negotiations.
There was every indication that the ad
ministration would be in no hurry to
announce a stand as to the new policy
i f the central Kuropean powers, or to
pass finally upon Germany's latest
proposal for a settlement of the Lusi
tanian case.
From both the White House and the
state department there came during
the day emphatic denials of a rumor
that the administration itself intended
to warn American citizens off armed
ships. At the state department it was
explained that it was for the citizens
themselves, who took passage on armed
ships not entering American waters.

Naval Officers Says Situa
tion "Not Hopeless"' and
That United States Can
Well Afford to Give This
Protection
Republican A. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, .March 8. Approx
imately a billion and a half dollars
for new ships and an annual tipheep
charge of $7tio.MiO,ftO" is what Admiral
Fltcher, commanding the Atlantic
fleet, estimates it w-nuld cost to carry
out the navy general board's recom
mendation that the American navy
should equal the most powerful fleet
afloat by not later than 1923.
The admiral's estimate was given to
day in testimony before the house na
val committee. Representative Calla
way, who brought out the statement,
(ailed attention to published reports
that Great Kiitain had added nearly
a million tons to her fighting ships
since the war began. He was asked if
the situation was not "hopeless." Ad
miral Fletcher thought not, adding that
judging by its great wealth, the United
States could well afford to give its in
terests the same protection that other
nations thought necessary,
Representative Hensley asked if a
race in building warships or in any
military preparation between two na
tions had not invariably led to war.
Admiral Fletcher said no. and ex
pressed the opinion that failure to
prepare was merely making certain
that a nation must surrender its rights.
Representative Callaway asked if it
was not reasonable to assume that the
(Continued on Page Three)
dicated that the next move by the Unit
ed States might take the form of an
inquiry to Great Britain as to the
authenticity of the German confiden
tial copies of alleged instructions to
British sea captains.
When attention was called to the ap
parent discrepancies between, the Ger
man and the British versions of the
instructions, officials pointed out that,
the date on the German version wac
prior to that on the British version.
It was said future events would be
considered in the light of the orders
now in force.
The United States will accept the
assurances ot the British government,
as to-which orders are in force, just
as it will accept the assurances of
Germany regarding any action by that
government.
Meanwhile, should an American citi
zen be involved in an attack on an
armed merchant ship, upon the facts
in the case would depend whatever ac
tion is taken.
Both men come from the eighth con
gressional district, which Mr. Adair
has represented in congress for five
terms. Mr. Goodrich was chairman ot
the state republican committee for ten
years and is now Indiana's member of
the republican national committee.
Goodtich's plurality in the 1,920 pre
