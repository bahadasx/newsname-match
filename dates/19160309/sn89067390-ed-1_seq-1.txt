"We must not )et the voters of the
country overlook the fact that had the
rates of duty provided by the Republi
can tariff law been in effect during the
past two year?, on the imports received
into this country during that period,
the revenues would have been suffi
cient to meet all of the running ex
penses of the government, notwith
standing Democratic extravagance,
and there would have still been a bal
ance left in the treasury." Thus
spoke a Pennsylvania Republican Rep
resentative. The Republican party in
times of profound peace has never found
it necessary to levy direct taxes on the
people. It has always been able to meet
ordinary as well as extraordinary expens
es by indirect taxation, which has largely
been paid by the foreigner. With a
depleted treasury and no improvement
in sight the Democratic party is face to
lace with additional problems of tax
ation, most of which must fall directly
on the backs of the people. If the
Republican party were in power today
with protective tariff, there would be
no necessity for this, neither would
there be a 'war tax' and many other
burdens."
The Republican party will eo into
the campaign of 1916, united, active
and vigorous, and the coming national
convention at Chicago, will select a
candidate who will meet with the sup
port and approbation of the people"
said an Illinois Representative to a
group of Congressional friends. . "All
throughout the country there has aris
en a great desire on the part or' the
people to rid the country of Democ
racy and what it stands for. Both the
foreign and fiscal policies of the admin
istration have greatly displeased the
American people and they are ready
to go back to the party which stands
for progress and prosperity and which
upholds American honor in all portions
of the world. The dillydallying and
hesitation that has marked this adminis
tration in its foreign policy, will cost
it thousands of votes. The constant
shifting of the views of the President
on public questions has shaken the
the confidence of the people in his
stability.
There is at least an even chance
that Oklahoma will swing into the Re
publican column in the elections this
fall that we will gain two Republican
Congressmen from that state, and that
many gains will be made by the party
in state officers," said a Middle West
Republican Conngressman to a group
of colleagues. "For some time Okla
homa has been heading towards Re
publicanism. The development of
the state has brought in many new
residents from the eastern states who
are of our party faith. The Democrats,
realizing they were slipping, have
been endeavoring to disfranchise the
ngro in that state, hoping to save
their bacon, but they have made
such a mess of it, which ended with
the disgraceful row in the legislature a
few days since, that public opinion in
the state has been stirred by such tac
tics. It has hurt the Democrats and
driven many voters to the ranks of the
Republicans, and when November
comes do not be surprised il Oklahoma
looms up in the list of Republican
states. Certainly the indications point
that way, and at least two of the pres
ent Democratic Congressman are great
ly alarmed over the outlook in their
districts.
Indiana is surely heading towards
Republicanism. We will elect a gov
ernor, a United States Senator, make a
gain of several Congressmen and carry
!he state for the national ticket. From
preaent indications, Congressman Adair
will win the nomination for governor
on the Democratic ticket. He is the
machine candidate and has the back
ing of Tom Taggart. Already his
candidacy is opposed by the leading
Democratic paper of the tatc, and
there is much opposition in the pr'y
against him. All along the line Re
publican victory seems almost assur
ed." These were the prophetic
words of a member of Cnneress from
that state.
Goodbye to our old Friend, "Free Sugar."
The Democratic editor of the Au
gust! (Ga.) Chronicle editorializing on
the action of the Democratic congress
in voting to repeal "free sugar" thus
bids goodbye to one ot his favorite
free-trade heresies:
All of which was expected and is,
probably, the right thing to do see
ing that the government has not been
raising enough revenue under the new
tariff laws and what is more, seeing
that there is still need for more and
more but; nevertheless and not with
standing, we can't restrain the feel
ing that we are parting with an old
political Iriend when we give up "free
sugar." And of course, we are giving
it up for a very long time to come.
We have fought many a political
battle together we Democrats and
'free sugar.' It has stood by us in
times of stress when neither free sil
ver nor anything else 'free' would pre
vail and great was its power as a ral
lying cry.
For years we have been told that we
couldn't get along without 'free sugar'
that the breakfast table fairly groaned
under the burden of the Louisiana
cane planter and the beet sugar baron;
that the Sugar Trust stuck its greedy
finger in every man's cup of coffee
and that without free sugar' pretty
soon, this country was In a fair way to
become a vassal state, or something
equally reprehensible.
Moreover, we were told that the
sugar tariff war a 'direct tax' levied on
every breakfast table in America, and
that it fell heaviest on the poor and
pure in heart provided they were very
fond of sugar in theirs. So the great
American people rose up, and smote
the sugar barons hip and thigh; and
'free sugar' was proclaimed king
with just the lapse of a year or two, or
uutil May, 1916, to enable the people
to get accustomed to this great bles
sing before it overwhelmed them.
But alas and alackl ere the ides
of May are here, our Democratic
brethern in congress met in caucus
and almost unanimously determined
that the days of 'free sugar' shall be
withheld from us for yet awhile longer
perhaps indefinitely. And all be
cause this country needs a large army
and a larger navy and must dig up the
money to pay for it: $40,000,000 a
year out of the sugar barrel, for one
thing.
And we are not complaining; on the
contrary, we really doubt if 'free sugar'
would have made so much difference
with the average breakfast table any
way.
But what concerns us is tne way in
which the Hon. Claude Kitchin,
Democratic house leader, revamped
an old Republican protective tariff ar
gument, when in explaining why we
are not to have 'free sugar' said the
expense of preparedness would have
to be met with as little burden and
annoyance to the people as possible;'
hence, they would just keep the tax
on sugar.
We seem to recall that the Republi
cans used much the same language
that nobody really felt the tariff on tiug
ar when our Democratic spell-binders
were telling us that if we didn't get
'free sugar' pretty soon we would sink
under the weight of this 'breakfast
table tax' and probably, die, in the
end, for want of a sufficient amount of
sugar in our system.
Truly, then, we are sad. Not mere
ly that we are to lose free sugar just
before we get it but even more at
the manner of its going."
"The Congress", remarks the Indi
ana Times" waits for action by a
President backed by the people."
This Congress will never get it. But
the next Congres will be Republican,
the next President will be Republican
and the people will be back of both

Trade Advantage for Canada
Our imports from Canada for the
calendar year 1915 were over 8 per
cent greater than for 1914, both years
under the Democratic tariff law, and
25 per cent greater in 1915 than in
1913, nine months of the year 1913
being under the Republican protect
ive tariff. Oar exports were 11 per
cent greater in 1915 than in 1914,
but 17 per cent less in 1915 than in
1913.
The official figures given out by the
Department of Commerce, show
that Canada can help England to car
ry on the war and still throw another
locp around the market, thahks to the
Democratic tariff-forless than revenue
law. Moreover, the war diverted a
huge stream of products to Europe
which otherwise would have come to
the United States, and as a large pro
portion of our imports from Canada
are products of the soil, those who
make their living from the soil in the
United States will appreciate what they
escaped.
In 1915 our exports to Canada
amounted to $345,000,000, largely
manufactured products, while our im
ports from Canada amounted to $177,
600,000, giving a balance of trade in
our favor of $167,400,000.
In 1914 our exports amounted to
$10,000,000 and our imports to $164,-
000,000 giving a favorable balance of
trace of $164,000,000.
In 1913, three months of which was
under the Democratic tariff law, we
exported to Canada merchandise to the
value of $403,000,000 and imported
goods to the value of $142,000,000
giving a balance of trade in our favor
of $261,000,000.
The difficulties arising from lack of
tonnage did not affect us in our trade
with the Dominion, and as most of
our imports from Canada consists of
goods on the free list, the Democratic
tariff law has given that country a great
boost.
Wilson's Last Lap
On March 4 Woodrow Wilson enters
upon the last lap ol his presidential
course. The home stretch is full of
of pitfalls and obstacles and he is al
ready nearly tuckered out with past
exertions. He does not dare to look.
back and it is an unpleasant prospect
that stretches out before him. When
he began the course he was the ''mask
ed marvel" of national politics. To
day the mask has slipped 'way off to
one side and he is seen for what he is,
a man with no fixed convictions who
is willing to play with the most sacred
of national affairs, the supreme court
and the foreign relations , in order to
obtain a personal political benefit.
Under these circumstances it is
small wonder that Wilson has lost his
stride as he enters the last quarter of
his presidential course. Winded and
weakened, he hopes with desperation
for some unexpected piece of luck to
help him through. His supporters
realize that nothing else can save him
Henry Watterson has lately said, If
Wilson's luck does not desert him, he
will be reelected." But a president
who looks for luck instead of clinging
to character to give him success is in
a bad way.
No Prohibitory Tariff Desired
The New York Journal of Com-j
merce publishes a special from Wash
ington which attempts to show a change
of attitude among certain in
terests throughout the country on
the subject of the tariff. "The
old style demand for practically prohi
bitory protection is growing weaker in
many sections," says the article, "and
in some quarters is dissappearing. It
is doubtful if any such demand ever
seriously existed. The American sen
timent for protection to domestic in
dustries, as represented in the legis
lation of the Republican party, has
never been for absolute prohibition of
imports.
A fair adjustment of duty rates
which would give our producers an
even break in their home market is
what they have asked. The Republi
can party has always placed its chief
reliance for revenue on the protective
tariff a tax paid chiefly by the foreign
er and which is of general benefit to
country. Obviously the levying of
extortionate rates would result in the
loss of this revenue producer.
The Underwood law was character
ized by its framer as a competitory
measure. It is, to the limit. Under
it 74 per cent of our imports are com
coming in free, and the average duty
rate now hoveis around eight per cent.
As a revenue producer it is a farce,
and the Democrats are now suggesting
57 varieties of taxation to bolster it up.
The change ot attitude on the tariff,
where it exists, is in the direction of
the Republican protective idea. This
change has been most marked in the
South, if it could vote orf xhe tariff to
day, would show a huge majority for
the protective policy.

for having gone joy riding with the

Of Interest to Farmers
In a recent issue of Commerce Re
ports, the Department of Commerce
expressed great surprise that the
Netherlands and Switzerland "sold
much larger quantities of milk in the
United States in 1915 than ever be
before." Inasmuch as the Democrat
ic tariff iaw placed condensed milk on
the free list, there is nothing surpris
ing about the fact that European
countries are taking advantage of it.
However, ball of onr milk imports are
coming from Canada who turned down
onr reciprocity off er in 1911 and recei
A Washington dispatch to the New
York evening Post" exults that the
report on Mexico which has been sent
to the Sena'e "is by no means as full
of dynamite for this administration as
the Republicans has hoped." The
dynamite, let us say, exists. It may
be kept in cold storage in the files of
he State Department for a time. But
it fs bound to explode one of these
days. Concealment of facts never
yet helped an administration.
The recent disgraceful scenes in the
(Democratic) legislature of Oklahoma
are the logical result of President Wil
son's pardon of two (Democratic)
politicians who were convicted for en
forcing the "grandfather clause" which
the Supreme Court has declared invalid.
When a man who is sworn, as the Pres
ident is, to maintain the Constitution,
will pardon, for partisan reasons, men
who have violated the Constitution,
he passes the word to all the thugs to
get busy.
We have not always agreed with the
utterances of George W. Perkins in
matters political, but he surely strikes
a responsive chord in our nature when
he describes himself as believing in
Republicanism "of the Abraham Lin
coln, Thomas B. Reed, James G.
Blaine, William McKinley" brand,
reflecting upon the present manner of
conducting our foieign relations, we
are inclined to place our emphasis
upon the "James G. Blaine" portion
of Mr. Perkin's words.
Now if the President would make
conditions unbearable for one or two
ether members of his Cabinet, there
might be a chance to improve the
public service The trouble is that
the least competent of the cabinet
members are not likely to resign.
Although Secretary of War Garrison
had a remarkable amount of patience
there was a limit to his ability to stand
the vacillation of the President. Who
can blame him?
President Wilson's decision to run
again created just about as much inter
est and enthusiasm as Vice President
Marshall's similiar announcement.
A sure fire method of breaking into
the head lines these days is for some
multi-millionaire to give a dinner and
