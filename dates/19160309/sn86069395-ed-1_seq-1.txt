constitutional amendment to be re

Col. E. H. Taylor, Jr., the Frank
fort distiller, not only denied Tuesday
that he had contributed $15,000 for
Gov. A. O. Stanley's senatorial pri
mary and $10,000 for his gubernation
al. primary as charged by YV. B.
Harvey, but declared that he had
made contributions in behalf of Sena
tor J. C. W. Beckham, who was run
ning' for Senator as an Advocate vof
State-wide-prohibition. '
Representative Harvey is in a fit of
frenzy because the Hpuse refuses, to
take seriously his charges lhat Gov.
Stanley's campaign fund was contrib-
uted to by liquor men. He has is
frsued a statement he expressing em-y-Vtlatic
dissatisfaction with the report
exonerating him. He repeats his
charges against Governor Stanley,
supports them with an affidavit, and
dares the governor to submit them to
an investigation.
By a voto of 276 to 142 the house of
representatives has tabled tho resolu
tion beforo tliat body which sought to
fwarn Americans from traveling on
wrmcd merchantmen. As tho senate
had already taken action in favoi of
the administration, President Wilson's
hands aro now f reo to continue nego
tiations with Germany concerning Unit
country's method of submarino war
faro, and especially its announced in
tmiim to sink armwl merchantmen
without warning.

The second trial of "Bubber"

in circuit court Monday. The jury

mer trial the defendants were given
life sentences, but the higher court
granted a reversal.
The -fifstwitness vas Dr. J. B.
Jackson, Who attended Mr. Renshaw
during the time he lingered with a
bullet in his head. - He said the shot
was fired at close range, not oyer
two feet, as shown by powder bums.
There are a large number of wit
nesses who arc giving about the'same
testimony as in the previous trial.
Many of them saw two negroes skulk
ing in the vicinity of the bridge where
Mr. Renshaw was attacked as he
drbve by in his buggy. None of the
witnesses could positively identify
thd prisoners as the men seen, WU
all said- their general appearance at a

them with scarcely a jmssing Imk.

Bitter Debate in Kentucky As
sembly L- & N. Wins In
Big Battle.
Frankfort, Ky., March 8. The
common earners, represented by the
biggest aggregation, of t.alent that ha
been seen in Irankfort this year
swept the platter clean in Tuesday's
sessions of the general assembly'.
n the morning the Louisville & Nash
ville railroad stepped into the, sena
torial ring with the Western Union
Telegraph company to renew the
battle which it had lost in Federal
court. An hour later it emcr
vic-
torious, Senator Sam Robertson's bi)l
to prohibit the condemnation for other
purposes ot railroad rights of way
having been passed by a count of 31
to 2.
In the afternoon the common car
riers again scored heavily by the
overwhelming defeat in the house of
the Finn bill to extend the rate regu
latory powers of the Kentucky rail
road commission. This measure,
demanded by the platforms of both
the democratic and republican parties,
was tabled, 52 to 32, on a motion of
Representative Humphrey.
The administration suffered another
defeat when Governor Stanley's plan
creating a state tax commission to de
vise legislation for the revision of
Kentucky's system of revenue , and
taxation was overwhelmed in the
house by a crushing majority. Thp
plan was embodied in a joint resolu
tion which had been introduced by
Representative Perry at the instance
of the governor.
An indentical resolution is pending
in the senate. In view of the action
of the house, however, it seems prob
able that a resolution offered by Sen
ator BooleS, which differs in some
important particulars, may be adopted
as it is indicated that it will be more
satisfactory to members. The Booles
resolution provides for a commission
of nine members. Three to be ap
pointed by the' governor, three by the
president of the senate and three by
speaker of the house. Under this
resolution the commission would be
expected to report next fall.
When the senate met it took up the
Knight "Jim Crow" street car bill,
providing for a separation of the races
in street cars in Louisville.
Senator T. A. Combs, of Lexington,
wanted to know "if 90 per cent of
the people of Louisville were in favor
of a separation bf the races in the
street cars, as,claimed by Senator
Senator Knight, why it was lhat they
were not afforded the relief by the
general council of Louisville which
had the power."
After a bitter debate the bill
passed, 18 to 12.

German Troops Reported to
Have Suffered Extremely
Heavy Casualties.
CORBEAUX WOOD CAPTURED
Penetrate French Redoubt But
Are Driven Out by Counter
. Attack.
Londori, March 8.-i-Driving hard
against the French line northwest and
southeast of Verdun the Germans
have been enabled to make addition
al gains toward Verdun, but extreme
ly heavy casualties, according to
Paris. Hill 265, to the southeast and
a portion nf Corbeaux wood, directly
south of Forges, have been occupied
by the Germans through strong
in
fantry attacks that were preceded by
i
extremely heavy bombardments.
The town of Fresnes in the Woevre
also has been captured.
The German attack was over the
entire front west of the Meuse ex
tending from Bethincourt to the riv
er, but except in the Corbeaux wood
and at hill 265, the French held back
the attackers at all points. Thus the
French still occupy the important
stragetic position on tiie heights of the
Cote de l'Oie, for the possession or
which numerous sanguinary engage
ments have been fought.
The occupation of a portion of the
Corbeaux wood would indicate that
the Germans have advanced over
three miles since they took the town
of Forges.
The Germans succeeded in pene
trating a French redoubt in the rer
gion of Donaumont, but immediately
were thrown out in a counter attack.
The recapture by the Germans of a
position from the French' in Cham
pagne, the pushing of the Germans
line farther forward in the Argonne
forest and the expulsion of small
British detachments from raptured
German trenches northeast of Ver
melles are related in the latest Ger
man official report. The British are
defending the famous Hohenzollern
reboubt position against German
bombing attacks.
Despite the report from Rome that
twenty German dreadnaughts have
come into the North sea from their
base at Kiel, and other reports which
seemed to presage the imminence of
l naval battle, nothing definite has
come through to show that German
warships are out maneuvering or
seeking battle.
