Political Situation in Stockmen s Gathering; Charge That

Pnmm Was Under Packers Influence Hotly Resented by
Friends; Chance That Nations May Yet Put Up Strong
Bid for Presidency in Spite of Caucus Action, Is Factor
to Be Considered; Race for Secretary Complicated by
Mix-up Over Campaign for Head of Ticket.
At a time when it seemed that he
had the presidency of the Panhandle
and Southwestern Stockmen's associa
tion cinched and double buckled, and
when nil the boys In the outfit were
reft'Jy to accept his election as a fore
front conclusion, James K. Piimni,
president of the American Trust and
Savings bank, of El Paso, last niKht
upset all calculations and threw the
political dope of the association to the
justly celebrated four winds by with
drawing from the race in favor of Ab
ner T. Wilson, of Clifton. Ariz., the
present first vice president and one of
the leading cattlemen of Arizona.
This action came at the close of a
day that was filled with exciting
events. The race for tho presidency
had become heated to a degree never
before known in the history of the as
sociation, and there were even rumors
at times that the organization might
split wide open as a result of the strife
that Was (joins on. At 6 o'clock yes
terday Afternoon it looked as if
trouble had subsided and that I'limin
would win in a walk. It was stated
that tho resolution changing the con
stitution had been pigeon-holed, that
Mr. Wilson would not accept the of
fice if elected and that the patli was
clear for the election of "Jim" Primm.j
Caucus at Elks' Club. J
Then, just as everybody had settled I

for the purpose of determining the ac.
Hop to be taken by the El Pasoans
in the convention this morning. Im
mediately it Was recognized that some-;
thing new Was stirring, j
The caucus was called to ol der by i
State Senator -Claud,! Hudspeth, who!
stated the objects of the meeting. J.j
M. Wyatt then took the floor and tul.lt

he declared, has there been any
Iiih-
tificatlon to the chaw that Mr.
Primm's interests are at variance to
those of the cattle raisers. Ho Is a
man who has at heart only the Rood
of tho cattlemen themselves, declared
Mr. YVyatt, and his election would
mean a big move forward in the de
velopment of the organization.
At the same time, said Mr. YVyatl,
.Mr. Prlmm realized that the Kood of
the association and the spirit of har
mony amoiiK its members were of far
more importance than the
personal
ambitions of any man, and for that I
reason, and in order to remove all!
possible room for dissension he had
asked that his name be withdrawn
from consideration as a candidtte for
the presidency, and had thrown his
strength to Abner T. "Wilson, of Clifton,
now first vice president of the associa
tion. Slake Is Prepared.
U was also stated that the El Paso
delegation W"uk asked to support
Thomas I). Lov, of .Sierra Dlanca,
for first vice president, and E. It.
Bralnerd for second vlco president.
The secretaryship Is to be fotmht out
on the floor of the convention this
morning, but every effort is to be
made to secure JJte flection of an El
l'aso mun. H' was also stated that
Amarillo had' withdrawn her claims

Much interest is centered on the
race for the secretary of the Panhan-;
die and Southwestern Stockmen's as-'
soclation. There are four avowed can-
dldates. They are J. V. Parrott, of.
El Paso; Charles Hunt, of El Paso;;
V. I. Amonett. of El Paso, nnd P. Y.
Plato, of Povlna, Tex. The four can-
,)lcldidateH yesterday and last iiiRht
wonted naro in the interest ot tneir
campaiKii and all declare that they
will "win with a walkover
Some little opposition has devel
oped iiRainst Mr. Flato by Panhandle
! and New Mexico stockmen on the
Krouuds that Mr , Plato in now a res
ident of Kansas OHy. one prominent
Panhandle stockman expressed him
self by saying" "Its a loni; ways to
N'iiri.s City u ti-t a secretary." All
this Mr. Plato emphatically denies.
Mr. Flato says he is a Texan and is
amonir the early rangers. Air,
Flato
says if he is elected secretary he will
reside whereevcr the officers
want
him to.
El Paso furnishes three candidates
for the office of secretary. This will
naturally split the vote of the Fl
Faso delepatioil. J. V. Parrott, well
known stockman who has been affili
ated with Mr. JIarrell since he has
l been secretary and present inspector
for the association
is continent of tno
nomination. '.Mr. parrott says he. Is
seeKliiK inu oiucc on ois nicion.
His
experience as inspector und ins con-.
nection with the secretary's office, he
says fully (pialifios him. Mr. Parrott
says he is in a position to devote, all 1
of his tome, to tho office.
Col. Charles P. Hunt has been
strongly endorsed by stock inert from
all sections. Ho will doubtless re
ceive a crood vote from the El Paso
and Panhandle delegates. Colonel
Hunt has been layini; his claims be
fore the delegates nt tho convention
Anfl ls JuKl a!t confident us his two
opponents.
It is expected that the strength of j
the El Paso delegation will go to Mr. I
Amonett. Many of the well known j
El Paso delegates are working fori
Mr. Amonett. As the others, Air.
Amonett is Just as confident as his
opponents. He is well known and
will make, a lively race, according to
the El I'aso Htorkiiien.
