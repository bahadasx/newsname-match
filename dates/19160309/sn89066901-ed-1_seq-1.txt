Mining Newt
A. Le-Tinsley and W. M. Lin
genfeldcr, experienced mining
men fifom Wallace, Idaho, arriv
ed in Mansfield last week at
tracted, by the reports of mineral
here arid have been looking over
the country. They express
-themselves as being well pleased
with the mining prospects here,
and believe that this entire Ozark
country Is underlaid with rich
mineral deposits. They have in
spected many properties where
mining has been in progress and
where prospect holes have been
sunk arid there seems to be
good mineral in paying quanti
ties. In company with Dr. F.H.
Riley, G. S. Burney, James Co
day, Frank Scheuermann, Fred
Carnall, Sam Ervin, Charles Bly,
Simon Carter, W. A. Black and
Ned Gaines, they made a trip to
the old crusher plant and adja
cent mines one mile from town,
to the Deaver mine and the G. S.
Burney mine, Many good sped
mens were found, and the Mirror
now has on display some good
mineral from the Deaver and
Burney mines. The Deaver
mine is apparently a very rich
mine, and although Mr. Burney
has gone only a few feet on his
prospect some splendid speci
mens of ore have been unearth
ed. We hope he will go ahead
and develop his mine to the limit.
The Scheuermann mines were
also visited by Messrs Tinsley
and Lingenfelder. Mr. Scheu
ermann.has been prospecting for
some time and deserves to strike
it rich and we hope he will
also Sam Ervin and Charles .Bly
of the Sammie-Bly mine.
Rufus Chandler has a fine
prospect. He is an experienced
mining man, and knows a good
thing when he sees it.
W. M. Huwell, Route C, Sey
mour, writes: "Find enclosed
money order for which send me
the Mirror, as I like to read the
mining news. Dr. Riley sure is
a booster. I wish there were
more like him. Tell him to come
out to Jericho and visit Z. H. I
pock's mine. Those Joplin men
are doing something now."
Encouraging reports come
from the Ipock mine, which is
being worked by Joplin men. It
is said to be one of the best for
miles around, and much mineral
has been taken out during the
past week. It is reported an 800
pound piece of carbonate of zinc
was taken from this mine
A.P. Stephens of Walnut, Kas.,
has been looking after his inter
ests here. He owns 80 acres 5
miles southeast of Mansfield, on
which mineral has been struck.
The place is occupied by Joe
Maine. Sample of the ore from
this place may be seen at this
office.
James Frye and wife came in
last week from Milford, Iowa.
Mr. Frye said he had a dream
that ore was struck here, and
he decided to come to Mansfield.
Upon his arrival here he found
that mining operations were al
ready in progress.
Sam Ervin, Charles Bly and A
T. Friend have leased 200 acres
of the Dodson Mining Co. land in
the vicinity of the old rock crush
er plant, a mile from town, and
miningoperations are in progress
E. A. Hunsaker of the Bryant
Mining Co. was here last week.
This company has excellent min
ing property and expects to re
sume active work Boon.
W. O. Williams and J. E. Sey
mour have added to our mineral
display what seems to be mag
nesia or chalk, found on their
farms.

a strong factor in the campaign.
While Mr. Dennis has made no
formal announcement of his can
didacy, it is said that he has the
matter uuder serious considera
tion, and his announcement to
this effect may be made soon He
is well known and popular and
has the qualifications necessary
in a good official and his many

the county will await with inter

A unique method of ranking
the high school students was
tried out last week with satisfac
tory results. Each pupil was
asked to rank himself or herself
in attendance, deportment, liter
ary work and each of the four
regular subjects carried, using
E. S. M. I. and F. to indicate
their places. When the teachers
went over the papers and com
pared the grades with their own
records they found very few
changes nectssury. Those who
marked themselves too low were
more numerous than those too
high, and the most pleasing fea
ture of the experiment was that
nearly every student seemed to
recognize where he was weakest,
whether it be in attendance, de
portment, literary work or oue
of the regular studies.
It the Die Catt?
The following letter which re
cently fell into our hands was
written by a "stand-pat" Ropub
lican to a former Progressive,
This former Progressive had
sent the "stand patter" a letter
containing some grains of sand
and a newspaper clipping to the
effect that Roosevelt would again
be a presidential candidate and
a successful one:
Dear Friend: lam returning
your clipping and sand. You
had me going all right; I waited
until I got a chance to he by my
self before I got a chance to de
termine what the white granules
were. At first I took it to be
salt, thinking perhaps I might
need it to keep me from spoiling
after reading the clipping. I am
afraid you are reading Democrat
ic literature. It seems that "the
dice are down," so let them
"shake, rattle and roll," and
here's hoping Teddy throws
"box cars" or "snake eyes."
But if he's an "even roller" and
"sets the dice," the only chance
is to catch them; but if he still
"throws a natural, "or"makes his
point," let him have the "kale."
So let's sand the track and go
down the line. Anybody looks
good to a "standpatter" if he's
on the right track
