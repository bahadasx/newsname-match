Labor produces all wealth, and to
the producers It should belong. The
present economic system is based up
on capitalist ownership of the .means

the products of labor belong to the
capitalist class. The capitalist is,
therefore, master; the worker, a

So long as the capitalist class re

The Interest of llu* working class
lies in the direction <>f Boiling Itself
tree from capitalist exploitation by
the abolition of the wage system un
der which is cloaked the robbery of
the working class at the point of pro
duct ion. To accomplish this necessi
tates the transformation of capitalist
property In the means of wealth pro
duction Into collective or working
class property.
The Irrepressible conflict of inter
ests between the capitalist and the
worker is rapidly culminating In a
struggle for the possession of the reins
of government the capitalist to hold
this and the worker to gain possession
of it, by political action. THIS IS
THE CLASS STRUGGLE.
Therefore, we call upon all work
ers to organize under the banner of
the Socialist party, with the object of
conquering the public powers for the
purpose of setting up and enforcing
tho economic program of the working
class, as follows:
1. The transformation, as rapidly
as possible, of capitalist property IN
THE MEANS OF WEALTH PRO

agricultural land, min>is and forests
and also factories, mills and railroads)
into the collective pv.9°rty of tho
working class.
2. Tho democratic organization
and management of industry by the
workers.
3. The establishment, as soon as
possible, of production for use instead
of production for profit.

Comment ,
This is the platform of tho Cana
dian Socialists and we feel that the
platform that will be drafted by the
National Executive Committee will
be one of reform measures similar to j
the. one wo had four years ago, and
will be a vote catclwng proposition
rather than a clear statement of the,
real Socialist position; and by having
both platforms on the ballot at the
same time, it will give the member
ship a chance to decide between Re
form and Revolution.
Twenty-siix members in good stand
ing. Published for seconds. Feb.
26, 1916.
Further Comment
The proposed platform was adopted
by the Socialist party of North Da
kota at its convention held Feb 4-6.
It has been adopted by a number of
Socialist locals throughout the Unit
ed States at different time?.
The Socialist party of Canada
adopted it at its convention in 1905
and it has remained the same during
the ten years.
By adopting this short platform,
embodying only the essential features
or principles, of Socialism, there is
little or no opportunity presented for
confusing our philosophy and aims
with Bull-Mooseism, or "Non-Parti
san" clap-trap. Second the motion,
comrades, and send notice thereof to
i lie National Executive, SO3 Madison
St., Chicago, 111.
GOOD WORK DONE
BY WOMEN COMRADES
Comrades Tillio Roeder ami Kath
crine Hodgins went to Mukilteo Mon
day for the purpose of organizing the
women in some way that would en
able, them to carry on some kind of
educational work. They report that
they found not only a strong sympathy
for Socialism among them, hut a gen
erally clear understanding of it.
Alter a number of visits had been
made about fourteen women and Gus
l'ilz met at the home of Mrs. Young
and spent several hours discussing
the various phases Of the work to lSe
done. Those present voted unani
mously to organize a study club, and
it is expected that in time this will
develop into an effective local.
Mukilteo has sufficient Socialist sen
timent, which, if it were crystalized
Into an effective organization, vvpuld
be of the greatest value in education
al work.
This should be an example for the
nther nearby towns. Let the women
| organize!!
"Preparedness" Discussed
N. Yakima, March 1, 1916.
Dear Comrades:
A few tilings have been transpiring
around North Yakima that you will
be interested in, perhaps, and as I
am particularly interested in fight
ing militarism and capitalistic pre
paredness, will say that we are trying
to bring the people out of the night
mare into which the jingo specialists
have led those who are hypnotized by
that specious chicane called "Pre
paredness for protection."
A few Sundays ago Ref. W. F. Tur
ner, minister of the Christian church,
proved himself to be possessed of
more stamina and principle than arty
of his ministerial associates, by de
livering two sermons against the so
called Wilson policy, and he notified
his congregation that he proposed to
deliver himself of his opinions on the
subject, if he were compelled to re
sign the following day. He still holds
his position, but has created an at
mosphere of antagonism among cer
tain fossils, whose pretended rever
ance for the ancient peace advocate
hasn't tinged their souls with much
sincerity A debate held In the same
church by members of the same con
gregation, resulted in the same church
by members of the same congrega
tion, resulted in victory for the anti
preparedness faction.
We were busy circulating petitions
against preparedness, to be submitted
to Senator Jones, who had at first ex
pressed himself a3 opposed to the pro
gram, when he flopped like a lobster,
and became a jingo as soon as the
plutocratic papers of the state began
to criticize his stand. Economic de

Another Kind
A. J. M. Hosem makes a pitiful ap
peal to the business men of Washing
ton in The Washington State Weekly
to organize and offset the encroach
ments of the Socialist party.
He says: "In this state there are,
broadly speaking, but TWO POLITI
CAL PARTIES — SOCIALIST AND
NON-SOCIALIST. The Communist
Manifesto, or platform of the Socialist
party, is in the hands of probably 50,
--000 men and women of the labor
unions and farmers of this state."
The emphasis is ours. Note how
truthful they are among their own
class.
He further states: "The Socialist
and labor element have been organiz
ing night and day for THE POSSES
SION OP YOUR (capitalists) PROP
ERTY in this country for 63 years.
The approaching fight is of greater
moment to the PROPERTIED INTER
ESTS of thiis state than any held
heretofore. You have gained your
possessions under a righteous govern
ment and stand to lose all under a So
cialistic government." Do you note
how scared they are and how badly
they want to retain that "righteous
government" so that they can skin
and flecee the workers for a few more
years?

I attended a banquet given by the
Spanish war veterans (having been a
head-hunter myself once), and offered
a few words of protest against the
subject of discussion, "Preparedness,"
and offended the patriots by offering
Allen Benson's voting scheme as a '
solution for wars. One oriental vet
eran with a volcanic vocabulary de
clared that the only reason I dared
express such sentiments, was because
I live in America; no other nation
would tolerate it.

Republican paper. Up to the present
time no one has accepted the chal
lenge to debate.

plans of the plutocrats, who preach
preparedness for poor people to prac
tice,
FRANK G. McMURRY.
P.S.—I replied to the editor's re
marks, but he refuses to publish it.
If I could have inveigled him into a
discussion, it would have been a pic
nic to put his arguments on the hum,
but he couldn't afford to publish my
reply because it would have made him
look around for his next argument. I
told him the conditions under which
I would fight, and that wouldn't do to
print in a perfectly good Republican
paper.
I may be able to stage a debate
with the Spanish war vets.
Success to you in your labors,
F. G. M.
After two columns of tWs kind of
stuff he goes on to say that the busi
ness element must "organize a cam
paign of conciliation worked out with
literature flaming with appealing
truths." We have a picture of the
"Appealing Truths," but we say "Lay
on, Mac Duff, and damned be he who
first cries, hold! enough!" We are
already putting out our 40,000 leaflets
a month besides using numerous oth
er means of education,
Further on he states that they must
"not do politics under the name of
'Employers' Association' or a similar
word, as it is like waving a red flag
in the face of a mad bull." Sure,
Mike! May we suggest that you join
the "Non-partisan League." By so do
ing you will help split up the vote as
nothing else will. But, let us add, you
cannot kill Socialism, nor the Social
ist party, with new political parties.
We are here to stay and here to win
and in the words of Jack London, "We
are going to take from you your pal
aces and purpled ease, and in (li.it
day you shall work for your bread,
even as the peasant in the field and
the poor air' rusly clerk in your
metropolises. Here are our bands.
