HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS
Commercial Club Committee Active
in Securing Cooperation of
Congressman Miller.
A letter has been received from
Congressman C. B. Miller by F. R.
Paine and J. A. Blackwell, who
were appointed harbor committee of
the Commercial club, in which he
states he will do all he can to insure
some harbor improvements for Grand
Marais. The improvements which
the Commercial Club is endeavoring
to secure for this village have been
recommended by the government
engineers, consisting of a new break­
water extending out into the lake,
widening the opening into the har­
bor and enlarging it. A certain
amount of dredging has been
mapped out, about doubling the
acreage of dredged area now avail,
able. The cost of these improve­
ments was estimated by the govern­
ment engineers and an appropriation
covering the same was recommended
by them. This is what the lake
captains and transportation com­
panies want, so that this harbor of
refuge will be of some value to them.
The boats of heavy draft cannot
enter here at the present time, and
it is imperative that these improve­
ments be made. Mr. Miller's co­
operation in this matter will be
appreciated by the people of this
community.

Brook Trout Fry Assured
According to a letter from the
State Game and Fish Commission,
Grand Marais is to receive a supply
of brook trout fry for distribution
in the streams that can be reached
from this point. Executive Agent
Carlos Avery expects to visit this
place some time this month, and will
then take up the matter of distribut­
ing the fry. He will also investi­
gate the matter of seining the
mouths of the trout streams, to secure
the large brook trout and placing
them in the streams above the talis
which the larger fish are unable to
climb. L. H. Lien is taking the
initiative in this matter of replenish­
ing and protecting the brook trout
supply.

$2l)0 FOR TOWN ROAD FUND.
_________
An ^Opportunity for Town Voters to
Increase Their Road Fund.
The Cummins Campaign Committee
wilf pay $200.00 into the road fund of
the Minnesota township which makes
the best showing in voting attendance
at the presidential primary to be held
Tuesday, March 14.
The terms of the contest are set forth
in the following statement issued by I.
A. Caswell, chairman of the committee:
TO THE VOTERS OF THE STATE
OF MINNESOTA:
The Cummins Campaign Committee
of Minnesota will pay into the road fund
of the rural township which oasts the
largest percentage of votes at the presi­
dential primary to be held in this state
on March 14, the cum of two hundred
dollars ($200), such percentage to be de­
termined by taking the total male vote
of the township at the General Election
of 1914 as a basis for making the esti­
mate for awarding the prize. Compet­
ing townships must be strictly rural,
that is, they must not be attached to
villages or cities for voting pnrposes.
This does not mean thas the prize will
be given to the township casting the
greatest number of votes, for that would
be unfair to the smaller townships, but
it is intended simply to iucrease interest
in voting generally in townships of all
sizes throughout the state.
For example, if a township cast 100
mule votes at the Ir.st election and 35 at
this primary its percentage would
be 35 if another township cast
50 votes at the genereal election and 35
at this election its percentage for the
pnrpose of this contest would be 70, and
it would be nearer the prize than the
larger township.
All classes of voters will be inclnded
in this contest in determining the total
vote, both Cummins and anti-Cummins
Republican votes, as well as those of the
members of the Democratic and Prohi­
bition parties.
Townships desiring to contest for the
$2f0 prize must make their claim in
Writing to Julius A. Schmuhl, Secretary
of State, St. Paul, on or before March
$1,1916, duly verified by the town clerk,
and accompanied by a certificate from
the county auditor of the county in
which the township is located stating
that the claimed figures for the general
election of 1914 and for the primary
election of March 14, 1916 are correct
according to his records.
Upon written notice from the Secre­
tary of State designating the winner or
winners of the contest the amount
above named will be forwarded to the
town treasurer or treasurers who may be
entitled to the same.
If a tie results in the contest the
amount will be divided equally among
the winners.

On Monday night the Willing
Workers and their husbands were
entertained by Mr. and Mrs. F. R.

O
came with a good smile in anticipa­
tion of the evening. At "Five
Hundred," head honors were won by
Miss Thelina Woods tor the ladies
and Mr. C. G. Stubstad for the gen­
tlemen. Mrs. Geo. Bayle received
consolation prize and John A. Black
well added another doll to his col­
lection. After partaking of a sub­
stantial luuch, the ladies had their
little chat, while the men enjoyed
the Havanas, and the reticence on
the break-up of the party was due,
not to fear of the storm, but a de­
sire to continue the good lime
which was had by ail.
At a recent meeting of the Cream­
ery Association, Jorgen Peterson,
Chris Murphy and J. A. Blackwell
were appointed a committee to list
the cows in the county, and to find
out how many additional cows would
be purchased if a creamery was
erected. The question of how many
cows the farmers could provide fod­
der and pasturage for is also to be
looked up.
N. B. Arnold arrived on the Sa­
turday stage to attend the Referee

A Letter From the Front.
Pat Bayle has just received a
letter Irom his brother, Tom Bayle,
who is in the trenches in France,
part of which is of interest to us all,
as,follows:
H.
We fire having pretty fair
weather here, there is no cold to speak
of but we have showers of rain every day.
We are out of action now. I guess we
will be out for about a month. It is
a pretty nice -coun try-around- here, if it
wouldn't rain so much v/e would have a
jake time. We are billeted 011 a big farm
and sleep in a barn, everybody bunched
in together, lots of straw for bedding so
I think we are pretty well oft". The
Twenty-eighth passed here the day we
came in, I guess they are going to have
their first crack at them. I heard they
passed first in all their examinations, if
they are lucky they they will be all right.

Reservation Notes
The following items were written for
last week:
Cupid is again stealing about on the
Reservation. Hearts are trumps. Clubs
being thrown into the woodpile where
the old heads can dig them out at
moments notice, yet, so far as the cor­
respondent. knows there is no weddings
chronicle or engagements to announce.
Perhaps the most important' evqnt of
the past week was the visit paid us by
Dan McDenald, the well known taxider­
mist who is located at Grand Marais.
Dan spent a week on the Reservation
visiting his neighbors and looking over
his
homestead
where
he
intends to make
some improvements this summer. Dan
is a iolly bachelor and our latch-strings
always hang on the outside for him.
Geo. Bukovich who liae been in the
employ of the Pigeon .Lumber Co. has
returned to the Bukovich homestead
where he will begin trapping for wolves
and foxes. His many friends welcome
him home again.
The dramatic play to be given under
the auspices of the Farmers Club Satur­
day eve, March 11th, is the cause of a
great deal of comment and commotion
in the community. Settlers are busy
rigging up sleighs, toboggans, suow
shoes and skis to carrv hem to the en
tertainment. A bumpe crowd is now
assured as the committe of finance has
decided to reduce the price of admission.
A charge of 1 cents will be made for
adults and children under twelve will be
admitted free.
It is reported the government will
build a No. 1 road between Grand Port­
age and the International highway.
I11 fact it is whispered the efficient agent
of Indian affairs' visit to the White Fa­
ther at Washington is relative to this
proposed highway. The agent is pro­
gressive and does not. believe 111 walking
the trodden paths, also a "good roads"
booster. We feel sure he will do all
within his power to secure a large ap­
propriation for this enterprise. This
road is very essential to the community
and county. This is the route selected
for the dispatch of the mails to and from
Grand Portage. It also leads to the
dock that serves the community in pas­
senger and freight traffic, besides it.
serves as an outlet for nine settlers who
are, or will be 111 the near future, tax
payers a.l of whom reside on or very
near this road. It is the duty of the
county to assist in this enterprise by
completing all work left undone by the
government. This way, at present, is
very rongh and has been too Jong neg­
lected as it is of more use to the Reser­
vation than even thelnternational high­
way.
The weather man promised us un­
settled weather and a north-we9t gale
for this afternoon, and he is surely malt
good.
You can always atford something—no
matter how small—put it in the bank.
