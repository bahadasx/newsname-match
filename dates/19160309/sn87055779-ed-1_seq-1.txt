Administration Plans to Rai
$200,000,000 Income in
Single Gigantic Bill.
Ir.tenint ionnl News Service:
WASHINGTON, March 0. The
administration revenue program. ;.o
provide an additional S-UO.Ot'O-.oOO
annual income for the government,
is to be included in a single gigantic
bill and rushed through congress
under party whip and epur. Confer
ences of democratic congressional
leaders have determined on a tenta
tive plan for disposing of the gov
ernment's linancial ditliculties at one
fell swoop. A preliminary survey of
proposed appro nations has con
vinced the leaders that it will be
necessary to raise about $200,000,000
rather than the .$112.000,000 addi
tional asked for by the president
early in the session.
Fast year's total appropriations
were $ 1 ,1 1 t.lblT.t' 1 2.( 2.
"After conferring with members
of the ways ami means committee,"
said Chairman Claude Kitchin of the
committee, today, "I believe the best
way of disposing of the revenue mat
ter is to include all of the proposed
matters affecting revenue or tho
tariff in a single measure."
The omnibus revenue bill will h
perfected in a democratic caucus and
will go to the house as a democratic
party measure.
The provisions which the leaders
now plan to embody in the revenue
bill include:
The creation of a tariff commis
sion as suggested by the president.
Tariff legislation protecting the
new coal thr dye industry, ami an
"anti-dumping" clause, now being
prepared by administration experts.
An increase in the income tax
amounting to about double the pres
ent rates, without affecting the pre?
ent minimum exemptions.
A tax on the profits of munition
manufacturers.
The rei-al of practically all the
objectionable stamp taxes now in
cluded in the war revenue law.
The plans of the con-rcssional
leaders fur rev enue 1 gislation wil!
be laid before Pres't Wilson by Ma
jority Leader Kitchin as soon a.s the
tangled foreign situation clears
enough to allow the president to turn
Iiis attention to domestic affairs.
"No linal action can be taken on
a general revenue bill." said Kep.
Kitchin, "until we definitely deter
mine what the total appropriations
for the year are likely to be. They
are certain to be large and as soon
as the military and naval appropria
tions are complete, we will be able
to i;n ahead."
The omnibus bill plan will enable
the democrats to hohl low n liscus
sion ami prevent a lon drawn out
tariff light. The measure will be
taken into the house as a party
measure, a special rule Iin itin1 do
bate and amendment provided, and
republican opposition will be steam
ndle.l out of the way. With the
dye staff legislation ami the tariff
commission provison tied up in a
general democratic measure, the re
publicans will be unable to make
any political capital out uf utts for
those pruviiiciis

WASHINGTON, March 9. The
United States will go into the merits
of merchant vessel armament in its
discissions of the entire question
with the Huropean belligerents. The
Prit.sh explanation of its plans,
whit h denies or justifies most of the
Herman contentions that its mer
chant captains are to attack sub
marines already has been drawn in
London. The memorandum, how
ever, probably will be withheld until
it is learned just what the United
States will do in its negotiations
with Germany. Meanwhile the note
explaining that no Pritish vessels in
the Atlantic trade, excepting those
plying to and from Mediterranean
ports, will he armed, is expected
shortly to be handed to Rec'y Lans
ing by the British ambassador. Of
ficials hope that it. will be so framed
that It can be used as an entering
-wedge for th renewal of the Amer
ican attempt to arrange a modus
vivendi on the entire submarine
question.
Britain Also Violator.
Incidentally officials pointed out
today that the matters in dispute
with Oreat Britain were fully a-s se
rious. ins)far as the charge of ruth
less violation of international law
was concerned, as are those with
Germany. The Anglo-French answer
to the American mails protest Is on
its way to Washington. It specifically
refuses to accept the American view
that The Hague convention permit
ted nil mail belligerent as well as
neutral the right of passage to its
destination unmolested. On the
contrary. Oreat Britain holds, state
department officials have learned,
that England is applying its internal
laws providing for search to all mail
on the pretext that, inasmuch as
neutral vessels are taken into Brit
ish ports to be searched they auto
matically become subject to port
law. England also has rejected the
United States' contention that her
"trading with the enemy edict" is
a violation of American rights un
der international law and has de
clined to modify it.
Sharp Answer to Ik Made.
There is no doubt in official circles
that as soon as these replies are re
ceived here sharp answer will be
made. It is said to be realized fully
by both the president and Sec'y
Irnsing that there is an apparent
cause for complaint in Germany
that this government has been de
manding that the Teutonic allies
observe the letter and spirit of in
ternational law while failing to hold
the Anglo-French allies to the same
strict accountability. This has been
due. however, officials point out. to
the dilatory tactics pursued by the
British foreign office which forced
the United States to press repeated
ly for a reply on the mails contro
versy before it could be secured.
Reply Date Uncertain.
Just when this government will
reply to the German note dealing
with the renewal of the submarine
warfare anl the appendices and ex
planations that accompanied it, is
not known. lt is stated that th
president and Sec'y Ionising will
confer reyanling it before any ac
tion whatever is taken. Officials be
lieve that the latest German explan
ation, made public yesterday, ma
terially has helped th German
cause. It is accepted tha'. Germany
would willingly call off her subma
rine warfare aeainst merchant ships
if the United States can secure con
cessions that would be considered a
fair return. It is also suggested here
today that the German note opens
the way for another enfort to have
the declaration of Indon accepted
as the last word in international law
governing war if the United States
should so desire.
The chief langer ofcomplicat ions
at 1 resent is in the fact that one of
the Teutonic submarines now out
may sink a steamer without warn
ing on which an American I? a
paer.ger. Even thou-h this should
occur, officials say. no preoiptate ac
tion would be taken, but the pres-

PARIS, March 9. Fierce attacks
were renewed by the Germans on
the Verdun front, both to the east
and to the west of the Meuse, but
were repulsed by the French troops,
the war otrtce announced this after
noon. At nie time, according to : he

the Germans succeeded in entering

There an as also lierce fighting

repelled the German efforts to re
gain the positions which they had

The text of the cotuinunhjue fol

continued its bombardment of the
enemy's lice of communication, par
ticularly in the eastern Argonne and
in the reg:on of Mont Faucon and

to dislodge us from the large space
of reconquered ground which we
had consolidated.
Battle Continues With Tenacity.
"East of the Meuse the battle has

"In the Woevre region both sides
carried on an intermittent cannon

surprise attack west of Le Pretre
forest resulted in our taking L'O pris

The steadily increasing violence of
the French counter attacks indicates
that the mighty battle at Verdun is
drawing near its climax. These at
tacks had the most success north
west of the fortress where the
French launched a drive in an effort
to recapture Bethincourt, Hepneville
and Forges. The Germans were
forced to give up the greater part
of the forest of Corbeaux, falling
back upon positions which had prev

There ha.s len no letup in the
smashing artillery duel which is stil!
raging all along the front from the

Both sides are using guns of every
calibre and a perfect tornado of
shells is falling night and day.
