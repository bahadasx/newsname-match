was shocked to find the lifeless
bo ly of his wife lying on the

health, apparently, when her hus
band left home in the morning.
The husband has the sincere
sympathy of his many friends in
this sad bereavement.
Mrs. Margaret Mitchell.
Mrs. Margaret Mitchell passed

and daughter, Mr. and Mrs.
Elliott H. Kirk in Taylor town

them since.
Mrs. Mitchell has two brothers,
one living in Ohio, and the other
in Kansas. She had been suf
fering from an attack of grippe,
but her illness was not of such a
nature a3 to cause any serious
apprehension, until she suddenly

before stated. (
ElishaJ. Smith.
ElishaJ. Smith died at his
home near Robinsonville, Bed
ford, co.unty, Pa., on Tuesday,
March 2, 1916, aged 84 years, 9
months and 24 days. The funer
al services were held at the Rob
insonville M. E. church, conduct
ed by Rev. Fronfeltner, Clear-
ville, who preached from these
words; 'I am Alpha and Omega.'
-Rev. 1:8.
The deceased was twice mar
ried. His first wife was Sarah
Elizabeth Smith, and to this un
ion six children were born all
of whom are living. His second
ire was Elizabeth Smith, and to
this union three children weYe
born, two of whom survive, and
Susie, wife of Raymond Hender-
shot deceased, who preceded him
to the grave nearly three years
ago. The deceased is also sur
vived by 48 grandchildren, and
32 great-grandchildren. He was
a kind neighbor and will be great
ly missed by all who knew him,
Mrs. Lloyd McLucas.
Laura Mareret wife of Lloyd
McLucas, died at their home at
lhomastown in Ayr township,
Monday evening, aged 21 years,
months, and 19 days. The
funeral took place at 10 o'clock
A Close Shave.
Last Sunday Harvey Unger of
Ayr township, in his six-cylinder
Buick, took his sister Alice (Mrs.
David Connor) over to Fort Lou
don. Mrs. Conner had been call
ed home to attend the funeral of
her mother, and she was taken
to Fort Loudon last . Sunday to
get a train for her home in Hag
erstown. Harvey's wife, his father, (Mr
John Unger), and Mrs. Nettie
Bivens accompanied Harvey and
Alice to Fort Loudon, and every
thing passed very pleasantly un
til returning home, they attempt
ed to swing around the Horse
shoe Curve on the west side of
Cove mountain on the Lincoln
Highway, when Harvey found
his steering gear unmanageable,
and in spite of his efforts to the
contrary, the car veered off to
the lower side of the road, and
was just hanging by a thread
when the driver got it stopped.
It required the assistance of Gar
ageman Cline to get the car back
onto the road, and it is marvel
ous that there was not a very
serious accident.
Now, as to the cause: The af
ternoon was just warm' enough
to make mud in the road where
the sun hit it fair, and cold
enough to freeze in the shade.
The car had picked up mud which
froze to the steering rod, and
made it impossible to make a
short turn. It might be well for
motorists to keep a watch out
for just this kind of trouble dur
ing the spring months.

The citizens of Pennsylvania are to have an opportunity to view an Exhibit which attracted more attention
at the Panama-Paclilc Exposition thanany other Health Exhibit.
The International Jury awarded the State Department of Health the Grand Prize for thus showing the result
of ten years' work by the Department In protecting the hoalth of the people of Pennsylvania.
Educators, health officers, tuberculosis experts, physicians and the public more than a million in all
studied this romarkablo Exhibit. Commissioner of Health Samuel G. Dixon, with the help of his competent
assistants, planned and "directed the corps of artists who were busily engaged for several months In Its con
struction. There were models, relief maps, transparencies, photographs an' diagrams, all designed and executed
with the utmost care to visualize tun work of the various Divisions of the Department of Health.
Typhoid prevention, the tuberculosis campaign, medical inspection of schools, housing, general hygiene and
sanitation are all illustrated
This Exhibit will be on view for some time In the Academy of Natural Sciences on Logan Square, Philadelphia.
After the people of eastern Pennsylvania have had an opportunity to view It, it will be moved to other large
centers of population.
The New County Atlas.
The engravers have completed
the plates for the new atlas of
the county, and the work is now
in the publisher's hands.
The atlas is made up with a
title page, an index pajre of
townships and post offices, a
page of these plates of Pennsyl
vania, showing the Judicial, Sen
atorial and Congressional dis
tricts of which Fulton County' is
a part, a full page - map of the
county, and a map on a large
scale, of each township on a
separate page, location of houses,
with names of residents, roads,
schools, churches, and much oth
er details are shown. Elevations
above sea level, of various places
throughout the townships are
shown in figures. The atlas will
be about 14 by 16 inches in size
and will be handsomely and ser-
vicably bound. It will be a fund
of valuable information that our
citizens, both old and young will
be fortunate to get, and that at
a price less than one-fourth the
cost of the map published more
than forty years ago. It should
be found in every home in the
county within the next few
weeks.
Crushed in Coal Mine.
John Schnatz, aged 49 years,
met death while working in a
coal mine at Coalport, Pa., on
the 11th day of January, 1916.
A large quantity of rock becom
ing detached from the roof of
the mine, dropped upon him,
crushing his breast and breaking
one leg. He was rescued as
quickly as possible by his fellow
workers, and an effort was made
to get him home, but he died on
the way.
The unfortunate man was a
son of the late Joseph and Sally
Schnatz and was born and rear
ed on the old Schnatz farm near
Scott's Schoolhouse in Todd town
ship. He was married to a Miss
Wo 1 f of Chambersburg, and
about 23 years ago, they went to
Coalport, where he had since
been working in the mines. Sur
viving him are his wife and nine
children, the youngest being but
four years of age. Three of the
children are married. Eleanor
wife of John Oyler, near Bethle
hem church, is a sister.

Clyde Strait, Princeton, 111.
To ease a troubled conscience, I
am enclosing three dollars which
will pay what I owe you on sub
scription and "make me good"
well into 1917. The 2nd day of
March marks just ten years since
I left "Old Fulton" for the first
time to try my luck in Illinois,
and during that entire decade,
the News has been right with
me, and has kept me posted on
home doings in great shape I
learned from the News that
Judge Peter Morton and wife
had been out West I wish they
could have stopped off to see me.
I would have written them in
Omaha, had I known their street
address. I shall be glad to have
any of my old Fulton county
friends visit me if they come in
to this section of the country.
Well, how about your new rail
road? I do hope for the sake of
my native county that it will not
be permitted to fall through.
Say, Mr. Peck, why don't you
crank up your Ford and come out
to see us. Even if roads are bad
they never get too bad for a
Ford.
Mrs. Esther Winter, Olpe,
Kansas. Enclosed find money
order for another year's subscrip
tion to the News. I see that
many of my old neighbors and
acquaintances have passed into
the great beyond; yet I am inter
ested in my native county, and
await with eagerness the coming
of your paper. Sometimes I do
long to be with -my old time
friends for a visit, and I think I
could spend the remainder of my
days in Pennsylvania.
More deaths have occurred
from Lagrippe and pneumonia in
Kansas this winter, than for any
like period in many years. The
weather has not been as severe
as in some winters, but the chang
es have been abrupt, and ex
treme. Best wishes to you and
to all my old friends.
George P. Atherton, Loving
ton, 111., The label on my paper
reminds me that it will not be
long until I owe another year's
subscription, and enclose here
with a dollar bill. It is just fifty
years ago to-day (March 6) since
I left Pennsylvania for Illinois.
I have been back to Hustontown
just one time since m 1873
when Mary Newman and I were
married. Since that time we
have lived in the central part of
Illinois. This is in the corn belt!
CITIZENS
Loses No Time.
To-morrow Witz Mason, son of
Ex Sheriff and Mrs. Frank Ma
son, of this place, will graduate
from the engineering department
of the University at Angola, Ind.
and will go at once to Topeka,
Kansas, where he has in waiting
a fine position with the Santa Fe
railroad, and is expected to have
the harness on and be at work
early next Monday morning.
This is another instance of what
sheer pluck and stick-to-it-ive-ness,
will do for a boy. While
the ties that bind Witz and his
home folks together are as strong
as in the case of any other boy,
he, in order to save expenses and
make the best possible use of ev
ery minute of the time, has not
been home for eighteen months.
Both he and his parents were
looking forward to a home reun
ion just after his graduation, but
this opportunity for employment
came, and Witz chose "business
before pleasure." This is a dis
appointment to his father whose
health has been very poor for the
last year or more, and who has
been confined to his bed during
the last eight weeks.
William West, a grandson of
Rev. Dr. West, a former pastor
of the Presbyterian church at
McConnellsburg, d i s a p peared
from Princeton University last
week, went to Harrisburg, en
listed in the army, and is now in
training for the coast artillery.
He was a senior, and his friends
are very much surprised at his
action.
of the Northwestern States. Of
course, we raise wheat and oats,
timothy and clover, and some
broom-corn, but corn is our main
crop.
No doubt things have changed
in Pennsylvania since I was there
just as they have changed here.
When I first came out here, we
had no railroads or, very few.
Now they are laced and interlac
ed, so there is scarcely a place
that is five miles from a railroad.
We are just 2h miles from Lov
ington, which has two. Then,
there are the interurbans, which
are fast taking the place of our
steam roads not only for pas
senger traffic, but for freight
Illinois is taking the lead in this
interurban building.
I suspect that there would not
be many people I would know if
I should return to Fulton County,
for fifty years is a long time.
There may be a few friends who
may read this that will remember
us. My brother John has always
lived with us,
State Agricultural Notes.
Pennsylvania ranks fourth in
the production of rye in the Unit
ed States with Wisconsin, Michi
gan and Minnesota leading in or
der named.
For the past twenty-five years
the production per acre of crops
of the country has been increas
ing at the rate of one per cent a
year.
Pennsylvania stands sixth in
the production of potatoes in the
United States and easily leads all
other States in the production of
buckwheat
The damage done by the Hes
sian fly in this State during 1915
was only about one-haif as great
as in 1914. Over one-half of the
counties were affected. Berks
county had one-fourth of the
crop of wheat affected.
The Dairy and Food Division
of the Department of Agriculture
secured and analyzed 8,9o9 sam
ples of food 8tufTs during 1915
and brought 1,165 suits for in
fractions of the cold storage and
pure food laws.
To capture the markets of the
State, for Pennsylvania fruits,
all that is needed is closer atten
tion to the appearance of the
package, as the quality of the
fruit is already established.
A former Pennsylvania resi
dent now living in Oregon writes
to a Pennsylvania fruit grower:
"Oh for some Pennsylvania ap
plesthe Oregon apples look
good but give me those rich,
juicy, quality apples of the dear
old Keystone State."
Fruit growers of Pennsylvania
claim that the greatest need to
the fruit growing business at
present is a law compelling every
shipper to mark his name and
address on every package he
ships, with the grade and mini
mum size of the fruit contained
in the package.
The highest return during the
past year to any Pennsylvania
egg farmer was sixry-three cents
a dozen according to W. Theo.
Wittman, a poultry expert of the
Department of Agriculture. The
break in prices was the earliest
yet known, and it is claimed that
fall eggs and not winter eggs
now bring the maximum prices.
An average farm with six cows
and four horses will produce in
the barnyard probably fifty tons
of manure in a year, which in
comparison with commercial fer
tilizer has a cash value of about
250.
During the past two years 2,
400 barnyard pollutions have been
abated by Pennsylvania farmers
by embankments of earth or con
crete diverting the surface drain
age, and saving both solid and
liquid manure for fertilizing pur
poses. It is estimated that this
manure saved, is worth $120,000
a year to the farmers of this
State.
In every horticultural district
of the State, one or more com
mercial sprayers are needed. A
man who will render good con
scientious service with a spray
pump, using the boiled lime-sulfur
solution, either homemade or
commercial, can do a lot of good
in his community and should
prove as useful to the citizens as
a man with a threshing machine,
corn shredder or cider press.
In the Dark.
One of the mails from the north
Tuesday brought us a letter in
forming us that illegal liquor sell
ing was going on Saturday nights
that it was being sold by the
quart; that the writer knows who
the violator of the law is knows
on what road he lives has evi
dence enough to put him where
the dogs couldn't bite him. But
as the writer forgot to sign his
name to the letter, and forgot to
tell us the name of the person,
selling the liquor, the fellow is
safe as far as we are concerned.
We take this opportunity, how
ever, to say-to the writer.of the
communication: "If you know as
much as you say you do, place
your information in the hands of
the District Attorney, and we
promise you he'll do the rest"
BOLTING MEALS.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgicne by
Samnel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Kealih.
Man is an omnivorous animal
and cannot afford to permit him
self to be hurried at meals. It
is impossible to bolt such food as
the average person eats without
injuring the health.
With the animal kingdom the
sense of smell, as well as the
sense of taste, enterj largely in
to the enjoyment of the meal.
This should be the case with man
kind. Odor, and taste, if prop
erly exercised, have a tendency
to stimulate the fluids essential
to proper digestion.
Chewing the food a reasonable
length of time should assist U3 in
enjoying the taste and flavor.
One of the essentials to good di
gestion is to eat those things
which we relish unless the con
trary is indicated by well estab
lished scientific and empirical
knowledge. Civilization has dull
ed our instincts in this respect
but it survives to a certain de
gree in our relish for certain food
stuffs. This relish should not be
mistaken for the inordinate fond
ness for certain things, Every
one can distinguish between an
occasional intemperateindulgence
and a natural taste and relish.
The proper flow of the diges
tive fluids is essential to good di
gestion. A liberal portion of
fruit is suggested by most diet
itians and it is a common belief
that fruit i3 a wholesome food.
It should be remembered how
ever, that acid fruits are often
irritating to the mucus membrane
and the habit if long continued
on a naturally weak digestion or
with babies, it will still further
interfere with digestion. Almost
everyone who is using grapefruit
or other acid fruit for food,
makes a mistake by eating it be
fefore breakfast or at any time
on an empty stomach. It should
be eaten after breakfast instead
of before as is the habit
Gasoline Soaring.
Less than a year ago gasoline
was retailed in Harrisburg at 11
cents. Last Friday it reached a
retail price of 31 cents in New
York City. McConnellsburg deal
ers who have long since made it a
rule to share pnfits with custom
ers, are content o take 25 cents
a gallon; but even here, prices
are liable to "change without no
tice." This works a hardship on own
ers of motor cars, as well as up
on those who manufacture and
sell them. At 25 cents, the cost
to the average . automobilist is
two cents a mile. At the pres
ent cost of tires, an automobilist
who gets off with 2 cents a mile
for tires is lucky. Then he must '
keep off a toll road, or he gets
stung for three cent3 a mile
more.
Theadvanee in the price of
gasoline is not considered fair,
and the Automobile Dealers As
sociation will make a vigorous at
tack on the oil producers, to
make the latter show that the
present advance is not a mere
arbitrary act on their part
