Washington, March 8.—(Special).—
Anybody wishing to acquaint himself
with what is going on before the var
ious committee of Congress, now hold,
ing hearings, will have to be present
at the hearings, depend on newspaper
reports, or wait an indefinite time be
fore a printed copy of the hearings, is
available. Hearings on the govern
ment ship purchasie bill had been go
ing on for days before the proceedings
became available to the public, and
there is complaint of delay on the part
of other committees in publishing
their hearings. The committees blame
the delay to the public printer, and the
public printer declares that the com
mittees do not send him the copy
promptly. In 1908 and 1909 with a
Republican Congress in charge, the
Ways and Means Committee held
hearings on the tariff, and the hear
ings appeared daily—as promptly as
the Congressional Record. Testimony
taken in the afternoon of one day was
in the hands of the public in printed
form the following morning at-nine
o'clock. That was Republican effi
ciency at work. A slipshod Congress
is on the job today.
"I am calling the attention of the
people of New England to the delay
and the procrastination of the Ways
and Means Committee of the House,
in the mttter of reporting the bill in
troduced by Congressman Hill, of
Connecticut, providing for an increase
duty on dye stuffs", said a New Eng
land member of congress. "This bill,
which increases the duty on dye stuffs
is urgently needed in veery industrial
section of the country. It should
have -been passed weeks ago. The de
lay may affect hundreds of industries
and- thousands qt operatives,.. It pros
vides that sufficient, protection be
placed'on dye stuffs so that American
capital may be invested in the busi
ness. It is purely for the purpose of
establishing this industry that this
legislation is asked. Men of capital
and manufacturers who desire to go
into the dye industry want to knpw
that they will be protected before they
invest millions in the business. The
Democratic party in Congress is tem
porizing with this proposition, fearful
that favorable action will mean a re
verscal of their tarieff policy and an
indorsement of the policy of protec
tion. They know that such action ab
solutely endorses the great cardinal
principle of the Republican party and
this is why they hesitate."
"We have been here ten weeks and
we are still, markinjg time," said a mid.
die Western Democrat at the Capitol.
I never saw Congress when it was at
such a standstill. The trouble with
our leaders is they do not know where
to begin. It is all easy to talk about
millions
for preparedness and for oth
er great governmental projects, but
with our finances so low and the fur
ther fact that our revenues have
shrunk to such an alarming figure, it
is no easy task for those who have to
face the music to work out a program
to make ends somewhere near meet.
I know the Democratic leaders are
having great anxiety as to where the
money is coming from and how it is
to be raised. We have to answer to
the country for the present and for
our future-financial conditions and no
one has stepped forward as yet who
has a program that will get us out of
our financial dilemma with any credit
or aiiy prestige."
"We have fallen under tiiis admin
tration into, .the deplorable practice of
receiving all., our, communications
as to foreign relaiionsthru the news
papers," says Senator 'Lodge. But the
President ask» for the support of Con
gress ''in ungrudging measure."
Next Monday evening the Commer
cial Club will hold another of those
pleasant meetings, when there will be
a good program rendered and a lunch
and smoker will follow. All mem
bers are requested to be there and join
in making this a most pleasant and
profitable meeting.

STUDEBAKER ANNOUNCES HALF
TON AND ONE TON TRU ti S
TO BUILD 10,000 IN 1916.
ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND STARTER
A FEATURE—SIX STYLES OF
BODIES STUDEBAKER COR
PORATION TAKES ITS PLACE
AMONG LARGEST BUILDERS
OF MOTOR TRUCKS.
Announcement made of the new one
ton and one-half ton Studebaker com
mercial cars is accompalned by the
information that the Studebaker cor
poration will produce 10,000 of these
vehicles during 1916, thus taking a
place among the largest builders in
the industry of trucks of like capaci
ties.
Three models of the half-ton carry
ing capacity are announced, and the
same number of the one-ton capacity.
The half-ton models include the panel
delivery car, $875 open express .875.
One-ton trusts' include the open ex
press type, $12®0 stake body type,
$1250 16- passenger brs type, $1400.
Quantity production is the rule at
the factory because of the big demand
for the new trucks that is reported by
dealers everywhere.
The new Studebaker models are
featured by the fact that they are de
signed and built primarily for com
mercial work. They are not adapta
tions of pleasure car features, but are
the result of long tests in actual com
mercial service preparatory to being
placed on the market.
Although The Studebaker corporation
has been building commercial cars for
half-ton capacity for several years, it
has never attempted production on as
large a scale as planted for 1916.
One of the fi-.AriSJas^'of the jiSw mod
els is that they are equipped with el
ectric starter, electric lights, speed
ometer and other high-class features.
In addition to their power, these cars
are notable for their attractive lines
and high quality body finish.
Considerable attention has been paid
to the comfort and convenience of
drivers. Everything necessary for the
operation of the trucks is within easy
reach of the operator and arranged in
simple fashion.
At the bottlers convention held in
this city last week, M. Richtman of the
Devils Lake Bottling Works was el
ected vice-president of the association
for the coming year. The many
friends of Mr. Richtman are pleased

One of the most important and in

for some time was delivered by Dr. C.
J. McGurren, secretary of the state
board of health, in this Grand Opera
house Tuesday at 2:30. This was an
illustrated lecture and was given at
the request of the city federation of
clubs, the subject being "Birth Regis
tration."
While there was not as large num
ber present as was hoped for those
present thoroughly enjoyed the talk,
and the doctor showed that he has his
subject well in hand, and presented it
in a most pleasing and able manner.
The lecture was illustrated with slides
and was in the form of a story of a
boy whose parents neglected to see
that the date of his birth was record
ed, the result of which brought about
many peculiar circumstances and at
times placed the boy in many awk
ward. positions. It illustrated very
clearly the importance of birth regis
tration.
Twenty-five years ago Mr. and Mrs
John Bryn, well known people of

some beautiful presents. It was a
most happy occasion and the exeni ig
was spent in music and dancing, ard
during the evening the happy couple
were presented with a beautiful Set of
silver ware and also a valuable set of
china dishes. The family were all at

Johnson of Montana, who was unable
to attend. Among the otthers who at
tended were Mr. and Mrs. Christian
Loften of DeGroat township, Mrs.

At a recent hill-climbing contest at
Montrose, Colo., a Dodge Brothers car
performed a feat never before at
tempted on a hill near the town by
climbing to the top with nine passen
gers weighing a total of 1760 pounds.
The contest was started for cars
carrying their seating load and the
Dodge Brothers car won easily. A
seven passenger that had stalled re
quested permission to cut its load to
five and it was then successful. But
to demonstrate its superior power, the
Dodge Brothers car was loaded with
four men in addition to its first pas
sengers and easily made the top.
The hill was but 200 feet long, but
it was a crooked and the average
grade was 26.6 per cent of the steepest
portion having a grade, of 45.22 per
cent and the most level part a grade
of only 7 per cent.
There were originally a number of
cars scheduled to try the climb, but
when starting time came only three
would compete.
