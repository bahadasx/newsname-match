Eleven Americans were killed by 400

town in the darkness early today, and
were driven oft only after nearly two
hours of fighting with 800 United

Thirty or forty Villistas were killed

American civilians were wounded.
Aroused from sleep by the sudden
on-rush of the Mexicans, firing into
the streets and houses, four American

one woman, were killed before the Vil

exchanges were presaged. The state
department will consume some time
in studying the German memorandum
and appendices, it was indicated to
day. The whole question probably
will go before President Wilson ana
his cabinet tomorrow. It appeared
probable this government's first ac
tion will be investigation of alleged
secret British orders to her merchant
men to attack submarines. Officials
had ground for hope today that Ger
many will go slow in unwarned at
tacks upon merchantmen, pending
negotiations. In enect nine days, the
new admiralty decree has not yet
brought forth an instance of violation
of international law, according to offi
cial information here.
While diplomacy was simmering,
renewal of the fight in congress over
resolutions to warn Americans oft
armed ships threatened. In the sen
ate, the parliamentary situation open
ed the way for further debate and
possibly another vote on the McCum
ber warning resolution.
Ambassador BernstorfT is not ex
pected at the state department again
until the administration is ready to
reply to the last German memoran
dum, or unless a sudden crisis should
develop from the unwarned sinking
of an armed merchantman.

AMSTERDAM, March 9.—A Ger
man cruiser squadron accompanied
bv several speedy destroyers, con
ducted a successful reconnoisance in
the North sea and returned to its
base without encountering any enemy
ships, according to derlin dispatches
received here today.
The seaward dash of the cruiser
squadron, It Is now believed, explains
recent reports from Dutch skippers
that the German battle fleet had left
Kiel canal ancf was cruising the
North sea in search of the British
fleet.
The reconnoisance expedition, ac
cording to well informed persons
here, probably was inspired by news
of the return of the commerce raider
Moewe to a German port. Several
fast scout cruisers accompanied by
speedy auxiliary craft disguised by
false funnels and a flotilla of destroy
ers embarked on the enterprise,
knowing they could take to cover If
ine British fleet came out and count
ing upon no difficulties should Brit
ish patrol boats engage them.
Several months ago a German
cruiser squadron cruised Into the
North sea In similar fashion without
encountering any British warships.
The Dutch trawler captain who
brought the report of having sighted
many dreadnoughts to Ymuiden, is
believed to have mistaken the false
funneled auxiliaries at a great dis

skipper reported the German squad

VIOLATION OP TREATIES
Seizure of German Ships In Portu
guese Ports, Resulted in Break
Between the Two
Countries.
[United Press Leased Wire Service!
BESBLIN, March 9.—Germany today
declared war on Portugal and the
Portuguese government became the
fourteenth involved in the world con
flict.
An authorized statement was is
sued today outlining Germany's posi
tion. It was pointed out that the seiz
ure of German ships by the Portuguese
naval authorities was in violation of
treaties between Germany and Portu
gal, providing that in the event ot
such seizure, arrangements must first
be made for compensation.
The German minister at Lisbon to
day notified the Portuguese govern
ment of the declaration, handing the
official document to the foreign min
ister with the remark:
"The German government therefore
now considers herself from this date,
at war with Portugal."
The German declaration was based
on the act of Portugal In seizing with
out previous notice, German merchant
men in Portugese ports. This action,
Germany charged in a sharp note to
Portugal, violated existing treaties be
tween Germany and Poi*tugal and of
fered evidence that Portugal is a "vas
sal of England."
To this note Portugal on March 4,
replied with a communication to the
German foreign office flatly declining
the German demands.
The government's action occasioned
no great surprise. Portugese and Ger
man troops had clashed earlier in the
war in the African possessions, Portu
gal alleging that German troops had
invaded her territory.
Portugal iater sent troops to aid the
British in operations against Germans
and in other ways openly displayed
her enimlty for the central powers.
She was bound to England by a treaty
pledging her to send ten thousand
troops to England's assistance should
England be attacked.
The declaration of war according to
an authorized statement from the for
eign office this afternoon, was made
necessary by "illegal seizures of Ger
man ships in Portugese ports, which
was the gravest ibreach of neutrality
and of such treaties."
Germany has therefore been obliged
to surrender her former fore bearing
attitude which she bad maintained on
account of Portugal's awkward posi
tion with respect to England," the
statement added.
It is believed here that Austria
will take similar action, Austrian
ships having been seized by the Portu
gal naval authorities.
In other quarters it has been hinted
that another result will be Spain's en
trance into the war on the side of
Germany.
The German statement lists a long
series of neutrality violations by
Portugal. The charges are:

PARIS, March 9.—Repeated and
heavy German attacks against the
village of Bethincourt, eight miles
northwest of Verdun, throughout last
night, were repulsed, the war office
reported this afternoon.
Two of the heaviest onslaughts
were preceded by artillery fire lasting
several hours. The German advance
was stopped by a French curtain of
fire from Goose Hill and Dead Man'
Hill to the east
'•East of the Meuse, around Vaux

the war office. "The enemy, however,
was unable to weaken the efficacy of
our artillery and was completely re

"In the Woevre region Intermittent
bombardment continued throughout
the night. West of Lepretr© woods,
we took twenty prisoners. In the east

to bombard enemy communication*"
The Germans attempted to swing
forward with their right wing on the
Forges-Bethlncourt front, west of the
Meuse, planning to straighten their
front before making a grand assault
on the Goose Hill and Dead Man Hill
positions. At the same time they
made fruitless attempts, the war office
reiported, to dislodge the Frenoh from
the Corbeaux woods positions, south
east of Bethincourt, recaptured by the
Frenoh yesterday.
In this region, the French are con
solidating the reconquered works. It
was stated.
German troops entered the village
of Vaux, southeast of Fort Douau

by a counter attack, the war office re

the Douaumont Vaux front were re

NEW YORK, March 9.—Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt "does not wish"
the presidential nomination and "will
not consent." to having his name used
in any of the coming state primaries.
He so declared today in a statement
made at Port of Spain, Trinidad, B.
W. I., and cabled by Henry L. Stod
dard, of the New York Evening Mall.
The statement makes it clear, how
ever, that despite his wishes the col
onel recognized that his services are
subject to draft in a crisis. The state
ment follows:
"I am deeply sensible of the honor,
confered on me and of the good will
shown me by the gentlemen who have
announced themselves as delegates to
be elected in my interest in the
Massachusetts presidential primary.
Newerth&ioBs, must request and 'I
now do request and insist, that my
name be not brought into the Massa

decline to be a candidate in the pri

"Months ago I formally notified the
authorities in Nebraska, Minnesota
and Michigan to this effect.
"I do not wish the nomination.
"I am not in the least interested In
the political fortunes either of myself
or any other man.
"I am interested in awakening my
fellow countrymen to the need of fac
ing unpleasant facts. I am interested
in triumph of the great principles for
whicii with all my heart and soul I
have striven and shall continue to
strive.
"I will not enter into any fight for
the nomination and I will not permit
any factional fight to be made in my
behalf. Indeed I will go further and
Bay that it would be a mistake to
nominate me unless the country has
in its mood something of the heroic

ideals, but the purpose measureably

with the tremendous national and in

we do or do not accomplish this feat
