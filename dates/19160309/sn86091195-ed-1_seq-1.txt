MOSES PEDDLES
SAME OLD DOPE
The first volley of Démocratie hot air
was fired at the Orpheum theatre
Tuesday night by Governor Alexander
who was greeted by a house. The
vice-presidents of the meeting were: Dr,
Povnter, superintendent of the B(ack
fo^t State Asylum ; S. L. Reece, one. of
thf directors of the asylum; G. L.
Brawlev, deputy game warden; Jap
Toner, the democratic editor; T. J.
Bennett of Shelley, ex-Demoeratie coun
ty commissioner, and Attorney Beakley,
who acted as chairman.
Mose made one of his characteristic
talks to the gallery, overflowing with
grotesque figures of speech that elicited
hearty-,applause and frequent laughter.
His time was consumed in explaining
the different branches of* government,
and telling Rift audience" what a goo 1
governor he 'has bèèh. He also told
them' that-ifie State of"Idaho had 1000
militia-men costing'them $200;00'0 every
two years, for which they should w beiid
their heads and bow their knees." He
informed them that the state, during
his administration, had accumulated
$1,000,000, and that it would not be
necessary to levy any state taxes for
1917. He took credit for the abolish
ment of the tax commission which cost
the state $20,000, ajuk all it did was
to submit a report, whieli he said , lié
had furnished for $1.75. While it Was
generally-known that the-State Insane
Asylum at Blackfoot was in a very
creditable-condition both sanitarily and
economically, his auditors were surpris
ed to learn that it had accumulated a
surplus of $35,000 during his adminis
tration. However, this startling sur
plus was a few moments later reduced
to $25,000, which he suggested should
be spent in building an annex to the
institution to be called an "administra
tion building." He said that during his
presidency of the state land board he
i ad fixed it so that the chief and only
requisite to borrow money from the
state was to become a ' ' ' boncvfied^
farmer," and that none other could
borrow money for his farm but a horrev
fisted tiller of the soil who actually
resided on the farm.
While many of Moses' thoughtful
audience doubted his veracity and
sincerity, they all conceded him the
ability- of being the King of Votegetters
the hero of the gallery gods and a liar-1
politician to beat in the approaching
gubernatorial election if Republicans
are not loyal to their party. Moses did
not intimate that he desired to succeed
himself, but if he can make all tho
Democratic and half the Republican
voters believe half he is telling them
no announcement is necessary, as his
re-election is a foregone conclusion.

Soon be erected on the comer, of First

firm that will build -the new struc
ture arid move here from Blackfoot.
The plans for the new building have

AN APPRECIATED OCULIST
For business reasons I have had to
call a number of times oil Dr. Scrii
borougli while here on his professional
visits, and each time he has had a
number of patients waiting for his ser
vices. And from what they- report
about his work the man surely has a
kick ' ' back of liis system anil method
of eye treatment that delivers the re
sults that he claims. In fact some of
his patients tell of gettmg better and
more far-reaching results than he had
promised. In the end isn't this the best
way- of doing to get people's good wilt
and confidence. No wonder Dr. Scaj
borougli is ajways kept exceptionally
busy. He informed me Tuesday that he
will have to cbme to Blackfoot twit
each month to take care of all tlie
work he lias here.

Councilman W. F. Berryman arose in

SAD DEATH OF
FRED McCRACKEN
The sad news of the death of Fred
McCracken, the only son of Congress
man McCracken, reached here last Sun
day. He had only been sick eleven days
with typhoid fever when his young and
promising career was ended. The fu
neral services were held in Washing
ton, 1>. C., last Monday when the re
mains were placed in a vault when
they will rest until moved to Idaho,
the land of his birth, ns soon ns con
venient. Deceased was 16 years of
ago, and was born in Blackfoot where
he received his earliest education while
his father was a practicing lawyjr
and county attorney. Besides his par
ents three sisters mourn his sad and
sudden death, which is also regretted
by a host ot acquaintances who knew
him ns a bright and lovable boy.
His parents have the sincere condol
ence of this entire community in their
unusunllv sad bereavement.
Two inmates of the city- prison who
were allowed to work on the streets
made their escape last week for parts
unknown, and their whereabouts is not
of much consequence, as our loss is
nobody's gain. . ■ -
