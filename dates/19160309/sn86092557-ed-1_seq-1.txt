Lieutenant Casteman, officer ot the
day turned out all the men remaining
In the camp. Shrieking battle yells,
the Mexicans In overwhelming num

was sent to Major Lindsley at Gib

throughout the town were riddled with

the living quarters of the Customs
House barricaded themselves behind
mattresses on the floor. L. Jager and

heads. Snipers posted in front of the
frame building which had been set on
Ore shot at the American Inmates as
they sought refuge from the flames
fast destroying several buildings.
These snipers moved deliberately In

householders and hotel guests start
led out of sleep- by the fusillade
promptly brought a shower of bullets.
