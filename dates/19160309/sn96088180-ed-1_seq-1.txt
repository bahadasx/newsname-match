great surprise to official circles.
The state department advices with

Slocum's failure to report an Inva
sion of Mexico leads war department
officials to belteve th story rntrue.

American Invasion, would .enable
American soldiers to round up the
Columbus raiders. By doing so. It fs
believed that intervention agitation,
now practically certain of breaking

It could gain any headway. -
