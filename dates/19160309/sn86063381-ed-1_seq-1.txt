BEGINS INVESTIGATONS
Farmers Ask Right to Kill Off Ani
mals May Be Trapped and
Sent to Refuge.
That beavers are becoming so
plentiful near Popple, Minn, that
they are disastrous to meadows and
farms, has been learned by corre
spondence from the farmers of that
neighborhood with S. C. Bailey, dis
trict game warden here.
Flood Meadows.
"I have some leased land with a
brook running through it that I de
pend upon entirely for my hay crop
for my stock. The beavers have a
dam on this brook on my..land. Said
dam floods my meadows. If I cut
the dam out they immediately re
build Now I want to know if I have
the right to capture these beaver
to keep them from destroying my
property."
This was the substance of one in
quiry The game laws do not allow
the killing of the animals owing to
the rapid extinction in previous
years
Bailey Investigates.
Mr Bailey has made several in
vestigations and finds that the ani
mals in that section, after being un
molested for many years, have grown
into quite a large colony They
have, as was indicated in the cor
respondence, become indirectly quite
destructive
The state may provide means for
the trapping of the animals and
moving them to some game refuge.
