Carter County, the financial .Mecca of the soui Invest.
Ill'T Ardmore is not going lo ml still ami let any other city Ret any
more than the crumlis which might fall from her tahle. Not more than two
days ago an incident, witnessed by lint a very few, took place which evidences
more than all of the newspaper talk or street optimism could demonstrate.
Fourteen merchants responded to a hurry call to meet the director of the
United States Regimental Hand which is to he here during Style Week. It
was possible to reach only a limited number and without an exception every
orfi responded. The object of the meeting was to lay before those men the
fact that it would cost a thousand dollars to bring the aggregation here and
get it back to their slat ion.
Had it been ten thousand, it would have been the same. There was no
hesitancy, no consideration of individual interests. Kvery concession neces
sary to secure this attraction, despite the cost and whom it would benefit,
was met instantly. There was but one thought, the promotion of Ardmore
as a great center and the benefit of Us, people, as a whole.
To have been present was to catch a vision of Ardmore's future, and
in that wholesome co-operative s pi rit of tho-e merchants was the predomi
nance of the ruling spirit v.hieh has made givat cities elsewhere in the na
tion. In this spirit being manifested by the 'Ardmore Itusiness Men's Associa
tion, it is not hard to see a greater and better Ardmore, nor is it Idle prophesy
to sav that Ardmore will be ready to meet all competition which might re
tard its progress.
