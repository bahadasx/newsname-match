Reception at, Carnegie Library
The reception at the Okolona
Carnegie Library, from 4 to 10
p. m , on Feb. 23rd, though one
day late never the less was truly
a George Washington entertain
ment, which was evidenced in
the appropriate decorations car
ried out in our national colors,
red, white and blue, the crown
ing feature being an immense
flag of our beloved stars and
stripes which served as a back
ground to the charming and
efficient Librarian, Miss May
McDowell.
The guests were received at
the door by Mrs. Laura" Harrell
who directed them to the head
of the stairs where they were
received by Mrs. James Gordon
and conducted to the bowl of
delicious cherry-red fruit punch,
which had been prepared by
Mesdamcs Jagoe and Jansen and
which was presided t)ver by Mrs.
Whiting Ames, while a number
of pretty girls, quaintly gowned
in costumes of "Ye Olden
Times", dispensed dainty sand
wiches. Music was
tumisnea
through the kindness ot Mrs. M.
R. Waller in the use of her
graphophone. The cherry tree
still bearing fruit and the little
hatchet occupied a prominent
place, and Martha Washington,
Dollie Madison and others had
been exhumed and these grand
dames, arrayed in all the gor
geousness of rurtling silk, white
lace berthas, powdered hair and
rosy cheeks, smiled and chatted
with the guests that were pre
sented by Miss Mollie Trimmier
to the receiving line composed of
Mrs. Fannie Clark. Aunt Laura
Murdoch, Mrs. Frank Foster and
others.
Miss Elbur Crighton received
the books which were donated
by the guests. .
Mrs. Mollie Allen, in her pleas
ant, genial way, was the essence
of hospitality. '
By request. "Aunt Laura"
sang in her clear, sweet, silvery
voice, as no one else could have
done at her age of 84 years.
Later in the evening Mr. Henry
B. Lacey, as master of ceremo
nies, called upon Mr. R. J. West
for the reading of Washington's
farewell address, which was
much appreciated by all.
Miss Williams, in'her inimita
ble way, recited two numbers.
Miss Clark gave a reading, in
which "Samantha Allen" en-j
joyed George Washington and
"Josiah Allen" became very
jealous of the memory of the
hero long since dead.
Mrs. James Gordon recited
"Our Colors," and last, but not
least, Master George Cavin re
cited a piece in which he thought
that George Washington might
have been just as great a man
had he been captain of a football
team.
,The Library Association is
indebted to the guests for quite
a number of new books 175 in
number. Also to those who so
liberally contributed refresh

Here Today for His Steers
and Heifers
J. E. Edens, of Chickasaw

Mississippi cattle with a load of
mixed steers and heifers that
sold at $8.00. They went to the
native division of the yards.
These were native raised Mis
sissippi cattle and of Mr. Eden's
own feeding. The price they
hbrought was the highest paid
this year for mixed steers and
heifers shipped from the state of
Mississippi. Mr. Edens is a
progressive stockman and ranks
high among those who are
striving to place the state on the
map in cattle raising. Live

Ugh! A Dose of
Nasty Calomel

and you may lose a
day's work
You're bilious, slues isli, constipated
and believe you need vile, dancerou
calomel to start your liver and cleei
your bowels.
II I A
nere s my guarantee rtsk your
druggist for a 50 cent bottle of Docl-
soii's Liver Tone and take a spoonful
tonight. If it doesn't start your liver
and straighten you right up better
than calomel and without griping or
making you sick I want you to go back
to the store and get your money.
Take calomel today and tomorrow
you will feel weak and sick and nau
seated. Don't lose a day's work.
Take a spoonful of harmless, vegetable
Dodson's Liver Tone, tonight and
watte up feeling great. It's perfectly
harmless, so give it 'to your children
any time. It can't salivate, ao let

United Daughters of Confederacy
Hold Meeting:.
The first Friday brought the
monthly meeting of the U. D.
C.'s, which took , place at Mrs.
George Cole's, Sr,
Elegance was the slogan of the
occasion. An elegant home in
which we were elegantly enter
tained; an elegant corps of la
dies, both old and young, with
our hostess in the lead; an ele
gant repast.
Last but not least, in our esti
mation, wnicn also seemingly
contradicted the statement that
Southern hospitality was vanish
ing.
Jeff Davis seemed uppermost
in thoughtjudging from little
interesting incidents related of
him by Mrs. Fannie Clark and
others that some on the program
were not present.- And insist
that we resolve ourselves into a
committee of "the all" to bring
up any little item of worth or
interest that we possibly can up
to may, to make our chain of
topics assigned, complete,
However, the missing links on
the program were very graceful
ly filled in by good music and a
recitation from Mrs. Col. Gor
don. Dues were collected and some
little business done. A chorus
of thanks was proffered the
hostess. Adjourned. Adieus
were feaid." '
Meet again first Friday in
April, at Mrs. M. B. Dottery's.

girl was born two years ago I began suf
fering with female
trouulo and could
hardly do my work.
I wa3 very nervous
but just kept drag
ging on until last
summer when I got
where I could not do
my work. I would
have a chill every
day and hot flashes
and dizzy spells and
my head would al
most burst " I got where I was almost
a wnLcir.g skeleton and life was a burden
to me until one day my husband's step
sister toid my husband if he did not do
something for me I would not last long
and told him to get your medicine. So he
got Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com
pound for me, &nd after taking the first
three doses I began to improve, I con
tinued its use, ard I have never had any
female trouble since. I feel that I owe
my life to you and your remedies. They
did for me what doctors could not do
and I will always praise it wherever I
go." Mrs. G. O. LOWERY, 419 W.Mon

If you are suffering from any form of
female ills, get a bottle of Lydia E.

commence the treatment without delay.
