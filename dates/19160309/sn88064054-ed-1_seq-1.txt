"PARKER'S ELECTION MEANS
NEGRO TO VOTE"---SANDERS
Ex-Gov. J. Y. Sanders does not ty o
believe that Jno. M. Parker per- that
sonally desires to return the power crat
of the ballot to the negro but re- tick
gardless of the intentions of Mr. han
Parker the results are what count PleE
and Mr. Sanders is of the opinion vot(
if Mr. Parker is elected that it will wou
mean the negro will soon have the the
ballot restorpd to the blacks race. In Pi
his speech at the Y M C A Saturday N
t night Mr. Sanders stated that at the mei
National Progressive convention
that Theodore Roosevelt, with his
a arms around two negroes, walked to thoi
f the edge of the platform and told tha
v the delegates of the convention that the
s these negroes were just as good as I eve
s any of the white delegates. Jno. bos
. M. Parker was a delegate and in the
p crowd and when Roosevelt made lean
. the statement Mr. Parker did not and
g object to it. Mr. Sanders then
dwelt on the record of Theodore
,s Roosevelt with the negro. He called th
e attention to Mr. Roosevelt, then
;t president of the United States. en- ra
tertaining Booker T. Washington at
rt the White House and having him
e at dinner with his family: He
further showed that Mr. Roosevelt the
,s had appointed a negress postmaster pal
at Indianola, Miss., and the whites ma
became so indignant that they re- the
fused to have their mail sent there, at.
Mr. Sanders neglected to add that Pa
after protests had been filed and of
every action taken to remove the dei
negress, that Roosevelt had the Pa
id office closed be.ore he would re- VO
d move the negress. He cited other in
id instances of appointments and qu
s- works of Roosevelt to show that es
ill Roosevelt was a believer in equal
a' rights of the negro in every respect. $
,r- to the whites. The speech was one oV
as of the best that has ever been de- sa
10 livered in Washington Parish and be
1o did much for the cause of De- In
it- mocracy.
In his. speech Ex Gov. Sanders gr
ill stated that if the democrats of the
dy state were split open that it would fo
is- result in one side trying to get the siL
elf vote of the negroes. His argument at
was good and carried convictions
because it is known that there is no to
[ law to keep a negro from voting to- H
Lu day. He has a right to pay his poll t°
I tax, and register and only the power o01
of the white race has kept him
from participating in the election.
Its, "Let the white vote split and the U
at negro vote will be returned and
im control the politics of the Parish
le and state. Suppose that there
l were 2000 white voters in the Parish,.
re- that they were apparently equally
he divided. There would be, say for
of arguement, 100 negro votes in the
S-Parish. The way these 100 negroes
eft would vote would decide the elec
till tion." said the Ex-Governor.
eir ROOSEVELT PARKER BOSS
"In the name of God if Jno. M.
led Parker wanted to be governor of
Iid- the state why did he not remain a J
ens Democrat and why did he not enter
ist the Democratic primary" asked Gov.
of Sanders." Because Mr. Parker gets.
an his orders from Oyster Bay and
sa Theodore Roosevelt wanted to gain
set power and split the Democratic I
ish- party."
PARKER STARTED 'PINK TICKET'
ard Mr. Parker and his friends are
ung claiming that the Democratic nomi
En- nees should be defeated for the rea
end- son that they were on the pink
ticket. The pink ticket, Mr. san
ders explained was some man's
choice for certain men for state
offices and their names were printed
4. C on pink paper. Four vears ago Jno.
lusa M. Parker sent 100,000 similar
The tickets broadcast over the state in
have favor of Gov. Hall and others, and
lood if the pink ticket was a bad trick it
nish was learned from no one else but
reat Jno. M. Parker who now denounces
tend it.
with HAD PICKED HAND BY 85,000
SGov. Sanders showed the absurbi
ty of the statement of Mr. Parker
that Col. Pleasant and the Demo
cratic nominees was a "hand nicked"
ticket. If it was there were 85,000 At
hands doing the picking for Mr. dred

Mr. Sanders then reviewed the on F
memorial constitutional convention in ti
when Mr. Pleasant was the only
juroi
thought of candidate for Governor Star:
i thathad the nerve to try and beat gani
t the greatest combination that was seen
'ever known. The New Orleans ward acct
bosses Gov. Hall. Jno. M. Parker
and every daily paper in New Or- the
leans were fighting Mr. Pleasant
and were for the constitutional con- to
vention. The country vote defeated ud
the convention and on that day Mr.

pratically nominated as the standard
Ibearer of the party. prey
THIE MORAL OBLIGATION of`
nex
Sanders then discussed at length
It the obligation of Democrats who
sr participated in the Democratic pri- "Th
,s mary to support Col. Pleasant and of
the entire state ticket He called
attention to the fact that certain I
i Parker newspaper urged to voters ma
of the state not to participate in the ord
1e democratic primary and that Mr. the
e Parker said he did not want the to
e vote of any man who did participate for
or in the Democratic primary. He the
id quoted Mr. Parker is several speech
at es before the primary as saying that
al "I.am a Progressive, I know where I Ma
t. st~ad." After the figures were given
out in the primary and lr. Parker
e- saw there was no earthly chance to
id be elected he now calls himself an
