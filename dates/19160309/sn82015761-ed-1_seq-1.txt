ing refused to participate in the

on which account according to
the advice from the office of the
Attorney General of the State of
Arizona and the County Attorney

was mandatory under the law
and not from choice.
The meeting was called to or
der by W. M. Hughes, Chairman

asked for by Mr. Gold, which the
chairman granted. The follow

Hughes, F. O. Twitty, and Mrs.
Andrew Miller. The Resolution
as read by Mr. Gold was then
offered by the chairman, Second

Resolved, that whereas Mrs.
Andrew Miller, a member of the
., Board of Trustees of the Wil

more than three consecutive

refused to perform the duties, or

The following ia the opioion as
rendered by the attorney General

based.
"In reply will state that sub
division 7 of paragraph 221 R. S.
1913 provides that an office shall
be deemed vacation upon his ceas
ing to discharge the duties of his
office for tne period of three con
secutive . months, except when
prevented by sickness, or when
absent from the state by per
mission of the legislature. I
think that it is within the prov
ince of the Board and also their
duty to declare the office vacant
when an officer has failed to dis
charge the duties of the office in
X any particular for th time pre
scribed by law. This of course
is a question of fact, as to wheth
er or not said officer has failed to
discharge any of tne duties of
the office, with which the law
can not deal.
I am therefore of the opinion
, that if the fact is true that the
officer has failed to discharge the

ter from the National Rifle Associa
tion. This makes the members of
the local club, members of the nat
ional organization, and puts them
in line to receive a number of U. S.
rifles and aquantity of ammunition
free. It also makes it possible for
each member to secure a govern
ment rifle for personal use at small
expense.
The officers of the Williams Gun
club are identical to those of the

I Melicks office. This is an import
ant meeting and all members should

BETTER BABY CONTEST
On the afternoon of Tuesday,
March the seventh, the regular
monthly meeting of the Women's
Club was held in the Parish
House.
Following the business of th6
day, the meeting was given over
to Mrs. Cureton and her assist
ants who had arranged a Better
Baby contest as a part of the
Baby Week program in Williams.
This little community is justly
proud of its large number of
intelligent and devoted mothers.
A large majority of these moth
ers entered into the spirit of the
day by bringing their babies to
the meeting, and as they arrived
with the daintily attired little
ones, the committee realized that
careful attention must be given
to measurements in order that a
fair award could be made.
, Various authorities give slight
ly different measurements for
the average normal child. The
figures used in this contest were
the average reached from the ex
amination of (4,000) four thous
and healthy babies. This average
was taken jls normal and the
babies judged accordingly. That
the climate of this particular sec
tion of Arizona is well adapted to
the welfare of babies was demon
strated by the fact that practi
cally all of the babies were above
the average in size and at the
same time well proportioned.
The committee wishes to thank
Dr. Jeffries and Mrs. Lebsch
who generously gave their time
to take the measurements.
While the examinations were
being made, a profitable exercise
of questions and answers con
cerning the care and feeding.of
babies was conducted by Mrs.
Cureton.
Mrs. Rittenhouse read an in
teiesting article setting forth
the importance of music in the
baby's life. The lullabies and
hymns softly sung by the mother
to her child influerce the little
life more than we realize.
There was suggested a list of
good lullabies and hymns which
every mother should know and
sing to her children.
Mrs. E. Adams then sang two
lullabies which were greatly en
joyed. This was followed by a
social hour during which tea was
served and greetings extended
to the guests of the club. Truly
"A little child shall lead them",
for the Better Baby contest brot
out many mothers who have not
before attended a Woman's Club
meeting. It is being demonstrat
ed that the Women's Clubs are
not clubs for the few, but for
every woman who would be an
intelligent mother, a good citizen,
a helpful neighbor, as well as a
part of the social life of tfie
community. Following are the
names of those in the contest
and the winning babies:
Joseph Amundsen, First Boy
James Mead Stark, Second Boy
Ernest Erikson, - Third Boy
Ellen Ramey, - First Girl.
