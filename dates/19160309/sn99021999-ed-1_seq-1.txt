Iction of House in Disposing of
McLemore Resolution Relieves
Senator of Necessity of
Talking.
HAS A TALK WITH PRESIDENT
ssert that Chief Executive Has !
No Desire to Plunge United j
States Into War. i
WASHINGTON', D. C. March 8.
Chairman Stone of the foreign re
latlons committee announced today
that he would not deliver the ad
dress to the senate that he has had
in preparation for some time with re
lation1 to foreign issues. Mr. Stone
conferred with President Wilson last
Bight following the rote in the house
tabling the McLemore resolution to
warn American citizens off armed
merchant ships of belligerents. He
said he would make a brief state
ment later.
"I hare a notice standing on the
calendar to the effect that I would
tomorrow address the senate on the
subject of armed merchant ships and
on other related subjects," Senator
Stone continued. "With much care
I have prepared a speech which I
purposed to deliver, and in which I
joined issue with some senators who
have spoken on these questions, par
ticularly as to the law, if Indeed
there be a law established and recog
nized touching the subject of armed
erchantmen."
Rrion for Being Clad.
"There are potent rtarons why I would
be glad to lay these matured views on
this and co-related tJJects before the
senate, but some ot my colleagues. In
whose Judgment I have great confidence,
a number of them being substantially In
accord with my views, have expressed to
me their belief that It would be wiser
and belter In every t ay If I should defer
the delivery of this nadress for the time
being., I recognize the force of what they
have said to me, and In fact sympathize
with, their suggestions.
"Last night I had another very frank
talk with the president I say frank, for
that Is the way we talked with each
other, aa we should. I am sure I will
not offend if I say that ao far from the
president desiring., to Involve this country
In thl" disastrous European war, bis su
preme wish is to avoid that calamity. I
may not be In accord with -some .of his
views; I have already stated that on the
floor, but tt should be Impossible for any
senator to believe that the president has
so changed the attitude he has ao long
maintained a an advocate of peace as to
wish now to make this cpuntry a party
to this conflict.
N Kor Upheddlaa Ware.
"As senators well know, I have fronf
the first been earnestly opposed to hav
ing any of these questions presented in
any formal way to the senate and that I
have been equally opposed to any public
discussion of these questions while they
were the subject of diplomatic negotia
tion. In this view I have determined that
I could better serve the cause that I have
at heart that Is, the maintenance of peace
this country by . withholding any ex
pression of my opinions so long aa the
questions at Issue. are the legitimate sub
Jttt of diplomatic negotiations.
"I profoundly, hope that no occasion
will arise when I shall feel obliged to take
these subjects up In a public way, but If,
perchance, such an occasion should arise,
1 will speak and act aa I think. In the
meantime I shall give the president what
ever support I can In the discharge of
thobe duties devolved upon him by the
constitution."
