Pretzel
A Warning of Death and
How It Was Dispelled

Fritz Schneller shifted his feet on
the brass rail in front of Donovan's
bar and contentedly munched the last
of a big handful of pretzels. The third
of Donovan's generous schooners stood
before him.
He blew the foam from his glass,
and, as it struck the sawdust with a
great plop, reached out a hand toward
the great bowl, never empty of pret
zels, that stood on the free lunch
counter.
Schneller looked into a pair of eyes
that made him think of shoe buttons
many times magnified. A busby mus
tache swept in long curves over sallow
cheeks almost up to them. It wiggled
and curved back over rows of white
and even teeth. Fritz's china blue orbs
enlarged at ieast one diameter.
"You have eaten your last pretzel!"
hissed the stranger. Then lie whirled
with soldierly precision and in three
strides was gone from the saloon. The
swinging doors flapped behind him.
Fritz put down his glass.
He glanced down the bar. The bar
tender and the two regulars were still
engrossed in their guttural mysteries.
Fritz made a jump for the door.
"Iley!" lie yelled as lie reached the
street. "Vot iss?"
But there was no one in sight. Fritz
went back into the saloon.
"Don't yousc want dat beer?" asked
the bartender as he re-entered.
"Ja!" exclaimed Fritz excitedly.
"Aber, 1 haf mein glass bier," Fritz
rehearsed the thing under bis breath to
himself, "und I tum. Stands der man
dere. His finger points, so. and lie say
I haf eaten my last pretzel! Psst! He
iss gone! But why? Why haf 1 mein
last pretzel eaten? Vot iss?"
Schneller decided to take the matter
home to Ids basement shop and Iris
dog. He could think It over as he
pegged and heeled and half soled. It
was no matter to be lightly dismissed.

He would finish bis beer. He turned
to the pretzel bowl, and, for no reason
at all, his hand stopped. It remained

brown crispnesses and was withdrawn.

finger, nad he tied, or had he simply
become invisible? Had any one else
seen him? Had there been any man?
Schneller put down liis glass with
the beer but half drunk.
It seined that lie had received a
warning of death—a death that would
come soon. With the next thought lie
ridiculed the idea. He had no enemies,
and as for the supernatural—bah. He
would test the warning-then and
there.
Fritz determined to eat another pret
zel and defy the fate that awaited
him. He turned and took a step toward
the free lunch counter. Then he stop
ped, with one foot poised in air.
At that moment the saloon porter
swept the bowl of pretzels into his
arms and started away with it. He
had carried out the free lunch and the
shelf stood bare of disbes.
Had tbe black stranger meant that
he never again would have the pleas
ure of crunching a pretzel between his
teeth? But that was most absurd of
nil explanations! Why should any one
want to stop him. a peaceable shoe
maker. from eating pretzels?
"Wake np. Dutch !" exclaimed the
bartender. "D'ye t'ink ye see a

"Nein." answered Fritz with dignity.
•It iss not veil I am today."

Schneller got up and put on bis bat.
He would take no rest and do no work
until be bad put the mutter to a final
test. It would be easy enough. They
kept pretzels at the cornery grocery.
He would go there- fie would buy
some.

Fritz turned with a groan and went
out.
Fritz walked down the street until
he eatne to a cafe. There, on the
counter with the pickled onions and the
dried herring, was a, dish of pretzels.
What easier than to buy a glass of
beer, stroll nonchalantly over and grab
ii handful? There were no dark brow
ed men in the saloon.
The bartener drew his beer. Schnel
ler raised it with a trembling band
and took one sip. A$i the cruical mo
ment drew nearer bis courage ebbed.
He walked toward the« free lunch.
A greasy cross section of herring was
the instrument of fate. As Schneller
reached liis hand over the pretzel dish
the foot on which liis weight rested
shot out at right angles to his body.
He clutched wildly aà Jie went down
and bis band grasped the pretzel bowl.
Then it rained pretzels and the dish
broke in a dozen pieces.
Tho bartender put one band on the
mahogany and vaulted over as the
handful of customers set up a laugh.
There was a terrifyingjfrowu on that
bartender's face.
"Git up, y'bum," lie growled. "Are
youse trying' t'put th' place on th'
pork ?" *
Fritz arose in confusion. It seemed
that there were pretzels in his eyes and
in his hair—everywhere but in his
hand. He stuttered out an apology as
he vainly endeavored tix put the pieces
of the broken dish together.
"I vill." lie hesitated— "1 vill pay
for der pretzels."
"Ye'll git out o' here." said the bar
tender, and he added a shove that ma
terially aided Fritz to find the door.
Schneller went back to bis shoeshop.
He sat down in the doorway with his
head in liis hands. A pretzel bad be

the world, as it was the hardest to get.
A little girl stopped iu front of the

at him. He knew her. she was Rachel

He came from his torturing reverie
to see that Rachel stood before him,
surrounded by a group of sympathiz

Oh, forgif me, Mister Shoemaker!"
Fritz could see that the fight, was
useless. He soothed the child and gave
her 5 cents for herself. She was not
to blame. When the children had gone
he locked liis shop and walked down
the street. It was well to keep mov
ing until the end came.
The shoemaker's eye rested on a boy
a few paces ahead who carried
basket covered with a paper. At first
Schneller looked carelessly. Then he
caught the brown glint of what he felt
sure was a pretzel. He hastened his
footsteps.
It was a whole basket of pretzels!
"Poy," said Fritz, seizing the young
ster's arm, "I rant a pretzel." His
eves were sunken and glaring. The
boy twisted away.
"Dese ain't fer sale, mister," he said.
"Dey're goln' soin'eres. Dey ain't

so hollow eyed as Fritz.
"Beer," said Fritz.
"Ye look rocky, Dutch," commented
the bartender. "Made a night of it?"
"Nein," said Fritz.
Schneller took a little sip. Even
from beer the joy had fled forever.
And when joy flees from beer for a
man like Fritz, what has he left?
Dass ich so traurig bin," ran through
Fritz's mind.
Schneller felt something. He could
not tell at first what it was. But when
he saw out of the tail of his eye the
dark stranger lean over the bar not ten
feet away, be knew what had settled

PRESENCE OF MIND.
Saved General de Segur From the
Fury of the Kalmucks.
In Napoleon's campaign in Russia
one of bis generals, Philippe de Segur.
had a peculiar adventure with a band
of Kalmucks. The Kalmucks are wan
dering tribes of southeastern Russia.
They are fierce warriors, and their
light cavalry forms an important part
of Russian armies. De Fegur's pres
ence of mind saved him from being
killed by them when the most Gespor
nte fighting could not have done so.
The French had attacked a body cf
Russians and put them to flight, when
Segur suddenly discovered that lie and
a few French dragoons had become
separated from the French army and
were being carried away with the re
treating party.
He and his men were surrounded by
band of Kalmucks. The situation
seemed so hopeless that the men gave
themselves np and, disregarding his
orders, passively allowed themselves
to bo struck down. De Segur deter
mined to sell his life dearly and contin
ued to fight. A Kalmuck lance struck
him from Ills horse. He jumped to Ids
feet and. getting behind liis horse, con
tinued the struggle, it was a hopeless
contest, however, and in a few mo

not a happy thought occurred to him
The Kalmuck leader, a tine looking
Cossack, remained calm while Ids men
were carried away with the fury of
battle. The expression on liis haughty
countenance indicated that he scorned
to murder a vanquished foe, and from
time to time he called, "Nikale, nikaie!"
De Segur guessed that this was an
order to cease fighting, ne shouted in'
periously to the Kalmucks that sur
rounded him, "Nikale!"
Immediately the fury died out of
their faces, and they paused, motion
less with astonishment. Their fury
once checked. Segur's life was saved
by their chief
Ho learned afterward that ttie word
meant "Do not strike" and that white
the Impetuous Kalmucks Imd not heed
ed the command of their chief they
were puzzled and disturbed at hearing
this word of their native dialect from
the mouth of one whom they supposed
to be an enemy.
Do Segur was kept a prisoner until a
peace between France and Russia was
arranged some months later. — Ex

A Military Compliment.
During the South African war an
order was issued to the men of the
Highland regiments that they must
cover up their tartan kilts as they
made too good targets for the enemy.
The order proved very unpopular and
caused a great deal of dissatisfaction
among the soldiers concerned. When
Sir George White heard tilts lie thought
of a way out of the difficulty.
"Let them cover up only the front
of their kilts," he said. "The enemy
will never see the other side." Lon
