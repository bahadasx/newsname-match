Everybody knows the story of Gulliver and the Lilliputians. Gulliver was a big, strong man, but he was mastered
by a'horde of little fellows, each no bigger thanone of his hands, who eaughthim while he was asleep and tied him down
to the ground by a thousand little threads. Gulliver could have dealt with these little people singly in short order, but
they caught him napping. The thread each one tied to him was not strong, but together they resisted his efforts—for
awhile. Then Gulliver woke up and he was pretty angry. He mustered his strength, broke the bonds which held him
and swept the horde of pests away.
There has been a farmer Gulliver in North Dakota and like the Gulliver of old he has been caught napping and a
horde of little pests have tied him down. But he is waking up! See him, as he observes what these little fellows have
done! You bet he is angry! And he is bursting those bonds which the little fellows have been years making secure.
.He is awake now and he is going to be a match for those little fellows—what?
