ASK BETTER DEFENSE
Carranza Government Is
Believed Impotent to
Handle Situation.
Washington, March 9. Faced
by a new crisis in Mexican affairs
by the Columbus massacre, admin
istration officials admitted that
President Wilson might find it dif
ficult to refrain longer from actual
interference.
At the White house the only
word given out was that 'steps
would be taken to punish the Villa
bandits but it was not indicated
whether General Carranza would
be called upon to do so or whether
American trops would be sent over
the line.
Secretary Lansing announced late
today, that the United States was con
sidering asking General Carranza for
permission to send American troops
into Mexico to capture the Villa band
its who raided Columbus, X. M., and
that the troops would be withdrawn
when they had accomplished their pur
pose. It was said that the request for
permission to send American troops
into Mexico probably would be for
warded to General Carranza before
night.
Washington, March 9. First reports
of the Mexican raid on Columbus, N.
M., were received at the White house
while President Wilson was having his
first conference with Xewton D. Baker,
the new secretary of war. Officials ad
mitted that the raid put a very serious
aspect on the Mexican situation.
While the policy of the administra
tion so far has been to look to the Car
ranza forces to deal with the bandits
some officials declared today that it
was grave question whether such a
raid as that on Columbus was not suf
ficient evidence of the inability of the
Carranza government to deal with the
situation to warrant sending American
troops over the line.
General F'unston Reports.
Major General Funston's first report
on the Columbus massacre says three
troopers were killed and that four were
wounded. It did not bring full details.
General Funston's report said firing
had ceased at 6:30 o'clock and that
cavalry was in pursuit of the bandits
southwest of Columbus. The number
of civilian dead was unknown at that
time.
An unofficial report received here and
transmitted to the Carranza embassy
said the 13th cavalry had crossed the
border in pursuit.
Renew Mexican Agitation.
The raid started a new agitation in
congress, where those who have op
posed the administration's Mexican
policy, openly charged that the attack
was proof of their repeated declara
tions that the Carranza government
was impotent to deal with the situa
tion and a fulfillment of their predic
tions that another outrage like the re
cent Cusi massacre in which 16 or
more Americans were killed by Villa
bandits when they held up a train was
only a question of time.
There were indications today that
the Columbus massacre undoubtedly
would be the signal for another out
break In the senate where the Oppo
nents of the administration's policy
have been most active. Early today no
official reports had been received by
the war or state departments or the
Carranza embassy.
Officials familiar with the president's
Mexican policy were silent, but indi
cated the raid had brought the situa
tion to a critical point, where it might
be difficult to stand by the policy of
noninterference.
Baker Takes Office.
After the president and Mr. Baker
had discussed the reports briefly, the
president decided that the new secre
tary should take office at once. He
signed Mr. Baker's commission and

Berlin, March 9, by wireless to Say

Portugal at 3:30 o'clock yesterday aft

minister his passports.
"The German declaration," says the
news agency, "emphasizes that this
step was made necessary by recent il
legal seizure of German ships in Port
uguese ports.
"The declaration enumerates a long
series of breaches of neutrality by tht
Portuguese government such as the
permission of free passage to English
troops through the colony of Mozam
bique; the permission given to Eng
lish men of war to use Portuguese
ports for a time exceeding that given
neutrals; the permission given the
English navy to use Madera as a naval
base; actual engagements between
Portuguese and German troops on the
frontier of German Southwest Africa
and Angola; frequent insults to the
German nation by members of tha
Portguese parliament, who never were
reprimanded."
The declaration further says "seiz
ure of German ships in neutral Portu
guese ports on Feb. 23 was an act
against the law and the treaties con
cluded between Germany and Portu
gal." Boy Terribly Burned.
Borosco Babitz, 15-year-old son of

RAILWAY EARNINGS
DECLARED SMALL
Chicago, March 9. Railways of the
Vnited States earned only 3.09 per
cent on their property investment in
the last six months of 1915, according
to information made public here to
day by the Railway Age-Gazette.
It was pointed out, however, that
statistics show that the railroads en
joyed a larger prosperity than in the
same months in 1914, but that the re
turn on the investment was smaller
than in the same period of 1912, "the
last corresponding period when earn
ings were good and in that year the
percentage of return was less than it
was in 1906."
In the same three-year period the
cost of road and equipment per mile
increased 13 per cent from $69,420 on
June 30, 1912, to $74,7S1 in 1914, aud
to $7S,682 on June 30, last.

GreatBritain
Refutes Note
of Germany
Washington, March 9. Challenging
every substantial charge against
Great Britain contained in the Ger
man memorandum submitted yester
day to Secretary Lansing by Count
von Bernstorff, the British embassy
today issued a statement intended to
show that while Germany contends
her submarine warfare is in retaliation
for British violations of international
law, that many of the German acts
were committed before the British had
issued the orders in council or com
mitted any other acts of which the
Germans complain.
The British statement follows:
"According to the German state
ment, German submarine warfare was
enforced on Feb. 18, 1915, as an act of
reprisal against illegal acts of Great
Britain.
"The Admiral Ganteaume, with 2,000
unarmed refugees on board, mostly
women and children, was torpedoed
and sunk by a German submarine on
Oct. 26, 1914. Two British merchant
vessels were torpedoed without notice
on Jan. 30, and the British hospital
ship Asturias fired at with a torpedo
on Feb. 1.
"The illegal acts complained of are
apparently the non-acceptance of the
London convention of 1909, the en
largement of the list of contraband,
the warning of merchantmen as to
mines in the North sea, and the cap
ture of the Wilhelmina with foodstuffs
on Feb. 9.
"The declaration of London of 1909
was never ratified by the British gov
ernment and was never binding on
them. One of the reasons of the non
ratification of the convention was the
claim of the German government as
to the right to treat foodstuffs as con
traband. "The enlargement of the list of con
traband is an acknowledged belliger
ent right; the warning to merchant
vessels in November was due to the
fact that the Germans had sown mines
in the high seas, resulting in the de
struction of many innocent merchant
vessels, foreign as well as British.
"The Wilhelmina, with a cargo of
foodstuffs for Hamburg, was only
stopped after the German cruisers had
destroyed the Dutch vessel Maria
(September, 1914), and the Frye (Jan
uary, 1915), which were conveying
grain from California to Ireland.

Berlin, March 9, (Tia London,
3:i. p. m.) The village and arm
ored fort of Vanx, northeast of
Yerdnn has been captured by the
Germans, the war office announced
today. Adjoining fortified posi
tions were also captured. The as
sault was made 3n the night by
Posen reserve regiments.
The statement says that in the west
ern theatre artillery activity on both.
sides was often of great violence.
The French, says the statement, re
captured the western part of a trench
near the farm of Maisons de Cham
pagne where hand grenade fighting oc
curred yesterday. West of the Meuse
the Germans cleared out the rest of
the French troops remaining in the
woods of Corbeaux.
"In a series of aerial engagements
in the neighborhood of Yerdun," says
the statement, "our aviators were Tic
tors. It is certain that-three enemy
aeroplanes were shot down. All our
aeroplanes returned safely. Several
of their brave pilots were wounded.
Enemy troops in villages west and
south of Verdun were heavily bom
barded." The statement says that in the at-,
tack of a French aeroplane squadron
within the radius of the fortress of
Metz, two civilians were killed and
several houses damaged. In an aerial
battle the machine of the commander
of the squadron was shot down and
the commander captured. The observ
er was dead.
"In the east Russian advances
against German advanced positions
are reported unsuccessful. The Bal
kan situation is unchanged."
Paris, March 9, (3:43 p. m.) The
Germans have been repulsed between
Douaumont and the village of Vaux
after several heavy attacks accom
panied by intense artillery fire and vi
olent infantry assaults, according to
the French official statement which
says the attackers were completely de
feated after having penetrated the vil
lage of Vaux.
French Report.
The official statement says that in
the Argonne French artillery has con
tinued its bombardment of the enemy's
routes of communication. Two abort
ive attacks west ot the Meuse were
stopped by French batteries. Renewed
efforts of the enemy, the statement
says, have not been able to dislodge
the French from the large stretch of
territory which they have conquered
and consolidated.
In the Woevre there has been an in
termittent bombardment on both sides
without any infantry action. In Lor
raine a surprise attack to the west of
the Le Pretre forest resulted in the
capture by the French of 20 prisoners."
SECRETARY LANSING
DENIES WILD STORY
Washington, March 9. Secretary
Lansing today requested publication
of the following statement:
"I wish to deny that there Is the
slightest foundation for a story sent out
of Washington last night by a news
service and appearing in the newspa
pers this morning to the effect that
American citizens will 'receive indirect
but effective warning' not to take pas
sage on armed merchantmen. The
story is false from beginning to end.
