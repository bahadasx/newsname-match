BECKHAM RECEIVED
WHISKY MONEY.
Col. B. II. Taylor, Jr., the Frankfort
distiller, not only denied yesterday that
he had contributed $15,000 for Gov. A.
0, Stanley's 'senatorial primary and
$10,000 for his gubernatorial primary,
but declared that he had mado contri
butions In behalf of Senator J. C W.

hlbitlon.
W. R. COOK NAMED AS FOREMAN.
The March term of the Garrard Cir
cuit Court convened last Monday morn-
ing with Judge C. A. Hardin on the
bench. Little dilliculty was had in im
paneling tfin grand jury and Judge
Hardin thanked those summoned for
not olrering trivial excusea for not
serving, and immediately began his in
structions to this august body, -which
held the undivided attention of the jury
and the large crowd that had assembled,
for over an hour. He first called their
attention to the oath that each member
had taken and stated that "only good
men were wanted as jurymen, because
they had the Interest of the community
ut heart and he felt that such men
would eee that those who were guilty
of any infractions of the law wouid be
indicted." "Saving yourselves, you
will diligently iiuire into all violations
of the law. You will find it difficult to
put anything in action that will destroy
u friend, but you are no longer acting
in the capacity of n friend or neighbor.
hollowing the duty which you have just
worn to do, will be u test of your
character and manhood." At this jwint
Judge Hardin was very complime itary
of our new Court House and said it was
the "result of co-operation and organi
zation and should be a source of pride
to every citizen of the county and a joy
for years to come' Xon anUwra.B
an organized body, to fight crime. ,ind
to aee mat the laws or your slate-juu
upheld." "Law," he said, "is nothing
more than the will of tho people ex
pressed in legislation." Iiefore the
present outbreak of the European war,
there were ten timeB as many homicides
in the United States as there wps in
any other country, which was the re
suit of social conditions.
Particular stress was laid on the il
legal sale of liijuor, gambling and hous
es of ill repute. He told of the evil in
fluences of all these and insisted that
each juryman aim to better these con-
ditions and maxe it hard for the violat
or of these laws.
He instructed them to Investigate
certain charges that had been made by
a local minister and if such violations
Were true, the public should be made
aware ol the (act and is such was not
the case tho public was entitled to
know it.
Judge Hardin dwelt at some length
upon the game laws of the state and
said that at one time Kentucky was
noted as the "Happy Hunting Ground'
and that conditions still existed here
that made the propagation of birds ar.d
fish the most desirable in any state. He
said the state game warden had told
him recently an Frankfort that the
farmers of Garrard county were doing
more and shewing more interest in the
inforcement of the game laws, than
any other county in the state and 1 ask
that each of you investigate uny viola'
of the game law and help these citizens
of the county to enforce it. He in
atructed them to look after the sanitary
condition of the city, all public build
ings, and report as to the condition of
each.
The grand juTy after returning two
indictments adjourned over from Moil'
day until today.
