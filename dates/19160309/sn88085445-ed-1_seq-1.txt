tbe most sensstioual run of tbe game

team
Toward the end of the game the ball
was fumbled by one of tbe backs on
the winning team. The ball rolled out
toward an opposing player, wbo Imme
diately swooped down upon It, gather
ed It under his arm and fled down tbe

At this a howl went up from tbe
spectators tbat might be beard for
miles. Tbat shout gladdened tbe heart
of tbe runner, for be real tied that be

toward him and ahrleked. The runner
put on an extra toarst of speed. It wa*
very encouraging to be applauded by
players and spectator* alike.
Presently be beard feet peuudlns
heavily behind him. But be felt confi

ground sped by under his feet, and the
ten yard marks were passed as though
they were but a few inches apart-
Only a few more yards, and then
fame!
But for all the runners speed tbe
pounding feet behind him drew stead
ily closer. Tbe man carrying tbe ball
beard them with dismay.
He leaped, be bounded, be fairly
flew, he was there!
When both runner* were but one
yard from the goal posts the pursuer
burled himself forward, clutched tbe
runner viciously about the knees, and
both crashed heavily to tbe ground.
Too late, however, for tbey bad fallen
over tbe goal line.
Tbe runner pk-ked himself up. aching
In every limb, turned proudly toward
the stands to receive the plaudits of
tbe spectators —and looked Into tbe
snarling face of a furious teammate.

We Need Merchant Ships as Delivery
Wagons of Commercial America
By WILLIAM HALE THOMPSON. Mayor of Chicago
THIS niition ig a great department store and the nation* of the world
its customers. As business men, you know the success of any en
terprise depends upon the ability to get goods to the customer
a hen the customer wants them. It ought to be apparent to anybody that
if we would maintain our standing as a commercial nation WE MUST
FIND AN OUTLET FOR THE INCREASING SURPLUS OF
MAX UFACTCKKS. It ought to be equally discernible that if we are
to hold our position in the markets of the world we must insure our
ability to make deliveries at any and all times.
THE WAY Tq DO THIB 18 TO ENCOURAGE THE AMERICAN REG
ISTRY OF MERCHANT SHIPS, AND THEN, THROUGH PROPER LAWS.
TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE FOR THEM TO CATER TO AMERICAN
SHIPPING. WE ARE NO WISER THAN THE OSTRICH WHEN WE DE
PEND UPON OUR COMPETITORS TO DELIVER OUR GOODS FOR US.
WHAT WOULD BE THOUGHT OF A DEPARTMENT STORE IN NEW
YORK CITY WHICH WOULD ABOLISH ITS DELIVERY SYSTEM AND DE
PEND UPON A COMPETITOR TO DELIVER ITS WARES! IT DOES NOT
REQUIRE MUCH STUDY TO FORETELL WHAT WOULD BECOME OF
THE BUSINESS. SHIPS ARE THE DELIVERY WAGONS OF COMMER
CIAL AMERICA. LET US SEE THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF THEM, SO
THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE AT ALL TIMES TO GET OUR GOODS TO
OUR CUSTOMERS.
If the farmers and merchants of this country have available a fleet
of American merchant vessels adequate to handle the water borne com
merce of our country, it would not bnly give confidence and stability to
our foreign trade, but WOULD ENHANCE THE VALUE OF EV
ERY SINGLE PRODUCT OF FARM AND FACTORY PRODUCED
IN THIS COUNTRY AND SOLD IN THE MARKETS OF THE
WORLD. Such a fleet of Teasels could be obtained, lam sura, if this
Sovernroent would encourage American registration by providing a re
uction in import duties where the goods are carried in American bot
toms or, if necessary, by a direct subsidy.

A plea for cooperation on Llie
part of the What, om Count>
Sportsmen in the matter of rear
ing Game Birds has just b<en made
by Co. Game Warden. J M Ait
ken. It is pointed out that many
birds were lost during ihe unprece
dented cold of last winter, and thai
every year many broods are de
stroyed by bird dogs which are al
lowed to roam about it large.
The latter trouble is one which
the Game Department feels that car.
be overcome v ith but litt'e trouble
provided t! . t the owners of b : rd
dogs will take an interest in the
matter.
At this time of the year prac
tically all of the game birds are
nesting and are easily caught. H
an effort will be made by bird dog
owners to keep the dogs at home
for a while, it is believed that the
loss of birds due to the late cold
weather will be more than made
ue for. 0
At present it Is a questionable
legal point whether or not the own
e. - of a bird dog. can be held fot
damage done by the animal. Any
how those having an interest it,
preserving the game in the County
will never want to test it out.
