Destructive Fires
Train No. 1 was responsible
for a prairie fire in J. M. Wood's
oasture last Sunday afternoon.
About four hundred acres of
grass were burnedt and only the
prompt work of a "sack brigade"
preyented the house and the
barn from being destroyed?
Monday, smouldering chips,
fanned into a blaze by a high
wind, resulted in another hun
dred acres being burned.
Tuesday's No. 751 was res
ponsible for another and a more
serious fire. A spark carried to
the pasture on the south side of
the track soon developed into a
blaze which -was beyond the con
trol of the section crew, and a
high north-west wind' took it in
the direction of Harry Bellamy's
home, four miles west of Meade,
A telephone call to this city
brought additional fire-fighters,
but not-until the barn was re
duced to ashes. By hard work
the house was saved and the big
pairie fire swept on; the next
home in its path being that of E.
D. Smith, three miles west of
Meade. Again by a close margin
the house was saved, though for
a time.it looked doubtful. So
near did the fire come that straw
on the flowerbeds along the north
side of the house, was burned,
on the west side a space of but a
few feet' intervened. . Several
tons of feed were burned, but
the barn, stock and stock sheds
were saved, The fire burned on
south into Ballard's pasture be
fore it was controled. Several
hundred acres of pasture and, a
large number of fence posts were
burned. ,
1 Dodge City, Kansas, March 6
A call for volunteers to fight
the prairie fire raging in the
southern part of Hodgeman cour
ty and nearing the Ford couqty
line, reached Dodge City this af
ternoon from IbeSetzcorn neigh
borhood. Thousands of dollars
worth of property, mostly bay
land and stock, has been destroy
ed. In several cases settlers
have been forced to flee without
making an effort to save their
property, as a high wind is driv
ing the flames before it, and at
terrific speed." Only one loss of
life is reported, that of a small
boy in the , northeastern part of
Finney county. When his fam
ily sought refuge in a dugout,
the boy hid in some tall grass
and could not be found until af
ter the fire had passed. The
fire started yesterday in Finney
county from an overturned stove
in a camp and thousands of acres
in Finney and Hodgeman coun
ties have been burned over.
Great Bend, Kans. March 6
The property damage "in west
ern Kansas from prairie fires
yesterday is estimated at $500,-
000. Very few buildings were
destroyed, as guards plowed the
ground and back fire was start
ed. A fire about fifty miles long
and thirty miles wide extended
from northeast Finney county
to near Ness City. Another
covered thirty miles of territory
from Dighton to Utica. One big
fire on the Smoky river and one in
Hodgeman co. in which one life
was lost, complete the number
of fires in the Ness City vicinity.
