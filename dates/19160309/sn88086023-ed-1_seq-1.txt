With the approaefl of spring evi

pie are beginning toturn again to the
DatatOrlum where they disported
themselves for a eoujile Of inontha
last year. The committee of the
council. In charge of the swimming
pot, has not abandoned Its plana for
healing (ha water so that the natuttc
rium ma he used earlier In the spring
and later In the fall.
CouncUman John Vaughan stated
this morning that he Us still strongly
In favor of putting In the electric
heating apparatus and will recom
mend such action tn the council In
the near future. The cost of the
heater is very nominal, he states, and
both the initial coat and the subse.
quent cost of electricity would be
made up by a small charge to bath
ers, he thinks.
The proposed heater la fitted Into
the Intake pipes In such a manner
that the water In passing must come
In contact with It. fn this way
Councilman Vattgjwn thinks the tem
perature of the water could be raised
to an degrees or above, a comfortable
temperature for bathing He does
not think it will cost more than S.tti

The action of the state executive
committees Is a response to an invi
