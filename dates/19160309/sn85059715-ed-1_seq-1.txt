First Attack Made by the Invaders is on the Camp of the
Thirteenth Cavalry Where a Number of American
Soldiers Are Killed and Wounded by Them.
LEAVE PART OF THE TOWN OF" COLUMBUS IN FLAMES
Villa Himself Leads the Attack and Completely Surprises the;
American Troops and Carranza Guards by Causing
a Telegram of Deception to Be Sent.
(By Associated Press.)
COLUMBUS, N. M., March 9.?Five hundred Villa bandits
attacked this point at 4:30 this morning, killed a number of civilians,
men and women, and held the town for an hour and a half.
Driven off by three troops of the Thirteenth cavalry they retreated
at 6 o'clock, leaving part of the town in flames.
A large number of Mexicans were killed.* Their bodies dotted
streets where they had been posted, picking off Americans as they
ran from dwellings and hotels. There appeared to be no wounded.
Several guests were burned to death in the Central hotel, which
was one of the first buildings fired by Villa's men.

Mexican bandits standing outside the flaming building shot

up later.
C. C. Miller, owner of a drug store, was shot as he tried to enter
the Hoover hotel.
Mr. and Mrs. Milton James and J. S. Dean, a merchant, also
were killed.
Howling Mob
The Hoover hotel, an adobe structure, protected a score of
cowering women and children, who remained in the room while
a howling mob of bandits surged through the surrounding streets.
11 Tiiey first attacked the camp of the Thirteenth cavalry. It
suffered'little although a number of American soldiers were killed
and wounded, and a number of cavalry horses ridden off by the'
Mexicans as they fled back towards Mexico after daylight
Complete Surprise
The htfack wa# ft complete surprise, ^illa deceived all the
authorities'b^dlfS^ftfching a telegram to Hachita,-N. M.; last' night,
saying that he was at the Nogales ranch ipuCbihuahua near the
border at least forty-four miles/rom'here, this telegram was
signed ostensibly by the American caretaker of the ranch and
stated that Villa personally was at the ranch.
All the while, however, the Mexican ban<jit leader was making
his way from Bosques Grandes ranch ."about twenty-flve miles
southwest of here.
A Mexican scout gave an intimation of his movements. He
I |{ reported late last night that he saw two parties of Villa's men moving
eastward from Bosques Grandes toward Palomas, an abandoned
Carranza outpost, six miles directly south below here.
I Heavy Patrols
I . Colonel H. J. Slocumb, commanding the Thirteenth cavalry*
( has heavy patrols out and two troops of cavalry at Gibson's ranch,
II mteer. miles wear,
Carrartza customs guards at the border prate, three miles
south of Columbus. Jia'cl dug a few rifle pits for the fifty Carranza
| soldiers who fled Palomas when Villa troops appeared in the vicinity
several days ago.
I Sneak Up
Villa's men apparently came over the line'at this point and' the
Carrnnza soldiers were reported to have joined them, deploying in
open order. Villa sent them up a deep ditch running up from the
') United States customs house to the railroad station.
The fight began here in town and the families of A. L. Briggs,
customs collector, and L. Jager, station agent of the El Paso and
Southwestern railroad, were in the midst of it, but no member of
either was hurt. M. Puche, a merchant, was shot through the
hand.
Shrieking Battle Yells
Lieutenant Casteman, officer of the day, turned out all the
men remaining in the camp. Shrieking battle yells, the Mexicans
in overwhelming numbers rushed savagely into the town, north of
the railroad tracks. A courier was sent to Major Lindsley at Gibson's
ranch, fifty miles east, to bring up the troops posted there.
Wie first Volley of fires woke all the townspeople.
Villa is said to have been seen by several Americans directing
his men. He cut the telegraph wires east to El ?asoto prevent
any call'for American troops stationed there. The telephone also
went cut of commission. .
While part of his forces fought the heavily rallied American
forces, Villa is said to have detailed snipers and soldiers to fire
houses. Houses throughout the town were riddled with bullets.
IRiggs, his wife and two children in the living quarters of the
customs house, barricaded, themselves behind mattresses on the
floor. L. Jager and his. wife and two children on the second floor
of the railroad station building' did the same.
In the section house nearby, Foreman S. H. McCullough and
his wife and their four children sought safety on the floor. Bullets
^ flew over their heads.
Snipers Do Deadly Work
Snipers posted, in front of frame buildings, which had been
set on fire, shot at the American inmates as they sdught refuge
from the flames. These Mexican snipers moved deliberately in
the dark. The lighting of lamps by householders and hotel guests,

a shower of bullets. Every house in town and nearly every window
appeared to have been nit from once to a dozen times.
Civilians armed themselves and from vantage points within
their homes answered the shots of the Mexicans. Some of the
bandits sought to entice Americans out into the streets by speak
ing English. J. S. Dean was caughf in this way.
Villa apparentl yleft when Colonel Slocumb's troops began
passing the snipers toward the south.
