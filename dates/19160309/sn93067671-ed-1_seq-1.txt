John 4. Hoton, of e1 to
now a capdlate for Congess
from this d16tret, was bod for,
ty.one y4rag on a farm nea
Neal's .rek 'urch in Ahder
son comtitV. '.hen he was old
enou4h he worked on the farpi
in summer OxWd we t to school
after crops wee laid byand in
this way prepared himself for
college. He worked his way
through school, eaching during
vacation, and grTaduated fromr
the Patrick Military istltute in
Anderson. In this institutioj
under the instruction ofICol. J.
B. Patrick, the great and good
christian teachek', young Horton
had the principles of honesty,'':,
honor and ddtty in 'all things
deeply impressed upon him.
These principles had been taught
him by christian parents in the
home. Now they were more
permanently fAxed in the very
foundation of lis character and
when Horton left the school he
want into the school room as a
teacher and Into the store room
as a salesman and later into the
mercantile business with his fa
ther at Belton. The principles
of honesty, honor and duty gui
ded him in buying and sellink
goods and he succeeded.
When the Farmers Bank was
organized at Belton in 1903 Mr.
j~orton was.elected cashier and
so faithfully did he discharge his
duties and prove his ability to
manage the business of the bank
that he was . promoted from
cashier to president in 1908, and
under his management the bank
has done vwell and has accom
modated many farmers in the
community, as well as others.
People who have dealt with his
bank will tell vou that they
have had a square deal.
When the subject of this
sketch was quite a boy it was'
mYpleasure to receive him into
the fellowship of Neal's Creek
church, and I am klad to hear
that he has been a consistent
member and active worker in
the church and Sunday School.
While every man ought to
ai uniust stand on his own mer
its, yet it is not against a man
to have good and honorable khi
people. So in the case of John
A. Horton, he has good people
on. his father's and mother's
side. His father and grand-fat
thers were successful farmers.
He has two uncles who are hon
ored and successful lawyers in
Atlanta, Ga., and his brothers
are successful business men.
-He Ise1l9sely related to the- Ma.
j6s. and Longs,'successfni far
mers and business men of Anvs
derson coanty. His wife was a
MisTate, of Elbert county, Ga.,
closely related to our popular
fdllow'-citizen, E. W. Tate, of
Norris. Dr. Wmn. A. Long of
Liberty married a sister of Mr.
Horton.
Should Horton be elected to
congress he would fill the seat.~
of one of our most honored and''
lamented representatives, who
was a kinsman of his by mar
r'iage. I refer to the lamenited
Asbury C. Latimer', who was,
perhaps, one of the most popu'
lar men among the masses of
this district.
Horton's friends do not claiml
for him the gift of tgreat orato
ry, b~ut, they do claim for him
honor, mrtegity, fidelity to duty,
that he Is a business man of fine
ability, a man from the people,
of the people and for the people;
a man who has workedl himsel~
up and who knows the needs 6f
the people. He pledges hltriself,
if elected, to do his best forfali
the people as God shall give him
light to see his duty an# gtade
