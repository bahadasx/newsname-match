atmosphere of the State ' is now
that of the bristling busy North

"Thre is not a trace of the
.'manana' of the Spaniards left
now in Florida, and there is not
a State in the Union that can
show for this present decade such
a large percentage of gam in pop
ulation as can the State of Flori
da, which Ponce de Leon made
known to the world.
"The stoppage of travel to Eu
rope, Asia and Africa has concen
trated in Florida the 'birds of
passage,' and, combined with
those who each winter seek a mild
climate, the State is fairly swarm
ing with visitors who are greatly
enjoying the delights of the semi
tropical State. The majority of
the industries of the State were
never so active as now, and the
productions of the State never so
diversified as at the present time.
The soil of the greater part of
the State has proved marvelously
fertile, and the extensive and sys
tematic drainage operations car
ried on for so many years have
reached a stage that has proved
their immense utility, and have
redeemed and made valuable mil
lions of acres of land useless for
agriculture, proves even five

as they now stand, the season on
all migratory wild fowl is closed
until next autumn throughout the
United States. Federal inspec
tors and wardens are required,
and othei's interested in the pro
tection of wild fowl are requested
to report to the department of ag
riculture all cases of violations of
the regulations, in order that
proper action may be taken.
The department of agriculture
has no power to suspend the law
or to pardon violations of the
regulatins. Doubtless the erron
eous impression, on which the
newspaper statements are based,
has grown out of the pendency of
litigation involving the constitu
tionality of the act of congress
approved March 4, 1913 under
which the regulations were pro
mulgated. The lower federal courts disa
greed as to the validity of the sta
tute and the issue Mas carried to
the supreme court of the United
States. The case was arsrued in
the supreme court in October,
1915, but has not been decided.
Following the lower court decis
ions, congress appropriated mon
ey for the purpose of continuing
the enforcement of the law. The
department of agriculture is
bound to report to the. depart
ment of justice violations of the
regulations if the supreme court
should declare the law constitu
tional. All persons should, there

they incur from failure to abide

Alcohol and Pneumonia
Para Grass Improves Native Pastures
The United .. States Public
Health Service brands strong
drink as the most efficient ally of
pneumonia. It declares that a
cohol is the handmaiden of the
disease which produces ten per
cent, of the deaths in the United
States. This is no exaggeration.
We have known for a long time
that indulgence in alcoholic liq
uors lowers the individual vitali
ty, and that the man who drinks
is peculiarly susceptible to pneu
monia. The United States Public
Health Service is a conservative
body. It does not engage in a
larmist propaganda. In following
out the line of its official duties it
has brought forcefully to the gen
eral public a fact which Will bear
endless repetition. The liberal
and continuous user of alcoholic
drinks will do well to heed this
warning, particularly at this sea
son of the year when the grue
some death toll from pneumonia
is being doubled.

An Appreciation
The ladies of the visiting dele

branch of the W. C. T. U.. who
were so cordially received, and
delightfully entertained during
the District Convention just held
in the city of Punta Gorda, were
obliged to leave before the concur
sion of the business meeting held
Tuesday morning. Therefore,
they were assembled together in
the train on their way to their
homes, by the district president
Mrs. Olive E. Stout, and passed
a resolution that they desire
through the medium, of the Punta
Gorda Herald, to express their
appreciation of all courtesies re
ccived, and extend their thanks
to all who contributed in any
way toward making the time
spent in your midst a pleasure.
Especially do we appreciate the
co-operation and hearty good
will, as expressed by representa
tives of your churches, of your
press and of your board of trade.

More About the Cedrat
Last week's Herald contained
an article irom me norma urow
er about the cedrat, a costly fruit
which often brings as much as
$5.00 apiece for use in Jewish re
ligious ceremonies. Since then,
The Herald has received informa
tion from L. B. Scott, assistant
pomologist of the Bureau of Plant
Industry m Washington iq the
following letter, dated March 3,
which may prove interesting:
"In reply to your letter of reb-
n. it j
ruary ior lniormation concern
ing the Cedrat or Etrog, would
state that we can lurnish you
with very little information con
cerning this particular fruit
which you do not already possess.
There seems to be considerable
difference of opinion among vari
ous authorities as to whether the
fruit is a distinct form of citrus
or whether it is a particular form
of citron which is handled in such
a way as to give the fruit the ap
pearance which is acceptable to a
Rabbi.
"At the pr 1 time, practical-
v the whole supply of these
fruits comes from the Island of
Corfu, Greece.

ment Station in
Dr. Arhonsohn,

Palestine, has

duce satisfactory fruits there. Wc
are under the impression that sev
eral trees which had been intro
duced from the Island of Corfu
and which are being tested at the
Plant Introduction Garden at
Brooksville, Fla., were bearing
this particular fruit. However,
wc believe now that these particu
lar trees are lemon trees rather
than Etrogs.
"We are trying to get in touch
with a few of the Jewish import
ers of this- fruit, but it seems to
be very hard to get accurate or
authentic information concerning
the character of the fruit. I will
