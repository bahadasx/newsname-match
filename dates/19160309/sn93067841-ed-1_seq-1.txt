tive address to the sctiooll upon the !
importance of caring for the teeth u'
as a necessary step toward a healthy ! ^
body. He stated that the mouth 1 p
bad been very property termed an j j
incubator of disease germs such *asj^
cause pneumonia, tuberculosis, diph- j ^
theria, etc. He pointed out the im-1 ^
portance of great care in the prepa-1 c
ration of the child's food since it i 81
often had to pass through a germ^
. infested mouth?one full of decayed ! n
[ or ulcerated teeth. i 81

converted into nourishing marial
