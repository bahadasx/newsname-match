GOT. HAMNA HOME
FROM EUROPE
Says This State Must Do Some
thing With Our Coal
Supply
USED THRUOUnil GERMANY
To Consider Plans for Handling
the Product in This
State
Louis B. Hanna, governor of
North Dakota, who went to Eur
ope as a member of the Ford
peace expedition relumed to Far
go Saturday night.
({overnor Haiina, who spent two
weeks in Germany, declared that
country is well supplied with food.
He visited several war detention
camps, war prisoners' camps, and
war hospitals, and declares those
he saw were clean and well main
tained, with prisoners being well
fed. Poland, says Uanna, is more
in need of aid than any other peo
ple in Europe.
Governor Hanna did not remain
in Fargo, continuing directly to
Bismarck, where his family is.
The governor, since landing, has
been in New York, where he con
sulted with physicians, and in
Chicago, where he attended to
business mutters. On arrival here,
Mr. Hanna said:
I am glad to ho home. While
away my time has been spent in
Norway, Denmark, Germany'and
Holland.
Their viewpoint of the war and
conditions generally is different
than ours.
Each of the so-called neutral
countries is trying its best to pre
serve its neutrality, not an easy
thing to do when surrounded by
war-like neighbors like Germany,
France, England and Russia. Hoi
land has its colonies in the east.
Indies, of great value, that she
might lose over night if she were
drawn into the war
Norway. Sweden and Denmark
each have their reasons for pre
serving a strict neutrality, and
yet knowing that, at any lime they
may become involved. In all of the
neutral countries their armies are
nn a war footing. The increase in
the cost of government j.n every
country neutral and belligerent,
has been enormous.
As an example lake the country
of Denmark. In times peace its
government costs about, one hun
dred anil thirty million kroners
per year. Now while Denmark is
not at war with any nation, yet
a strong undercurrent in the conn!

Ihe United Stales to lake the lead.l
peace movement, that such a step
would be taken hy the world as -in
evidence of weakness on the part
of the nation making the first pro

While in (ierinany I visited war

of, clean and plenty of wholesome
food. The prisoners are weighed
each week and Ihe records show
that they have gained in weight.
