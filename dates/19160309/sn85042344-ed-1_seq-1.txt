On the house side several members

their remarks of yesterday on the
tabling of Ihe MeLemore armed ship
resolution, and Minority Leader Mann
took occasion lo suggest that some
bad voted on both sides of Ihe ques

explain their irositiotis to constituents
on cither side. Itepresentatlve Foss
of Ohio began reply, but Mr. Mann
shut off further argument by a point
of order.
Itiinior llenlcd
From both the White House und the
state department there came during
the day emphatic denials of a rumor
that the administration itself intend
ed to warn American citizens off
armed ships. At the slate department
it was explained that it was for the
citizens themselves who took passage
on in mid ships not entering Ameri
can waters to (leici iniiie whether they
Were boarding vessels iirmed de
fensively or offensively and the nature
of the instructions under which ship
captains would net in the presence of
a submarine. An offensively armed
ship which enters American waters. It
was said, would be regarded as u war
voss'l and would not be allowed to
remain in more than L'l hours. In
foreign waters, however, it Is no con
cern of this government how ships are
armed.
The now submarine campaign of
the central powers has now been In
operation eight days and up to tonight
the state department had no reports:
ol any act by a Oerman or Austrian
submarine eommanibr under thn
changed orders. State department
officials make no secret of the fact
that they do not believe unv aids will
be committed if they can bo avoided,
which involve the death or injury of
American clllzens.
Administration officials began con
sidering today the complete trans
lated documents appended to the
lermnn declaration of Intentions. U
was Indicated that the next move by
the I'ulted States might take the form
of an inquiry to Croat ltrttaln as to
the authenticity of the Herman con
fidential copies of alleged Instruc
tions to Hrlllsh sea captains.
Careful Consideration.
When attention was culled to tho
apparent discrepancies between thn
Herman and the Hrltlsh. versions of
the Instructions officials pointed out
that the date on tho Oerman version
was prior to that on the llritlsh ver
sion. It was said that future events
would be considered In the light of
