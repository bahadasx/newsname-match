Good Roads Into Yale.
1 The work of hauling gravel for
building the good roads east of Yale
was finished on Monday. Commission
er Stevens, of Port Huron, Informs the
Expositor that 1400 yards of gravel
have been hauled and placed along the
highway at a cost of S1.07 per yard.
This figure includes dynamite used,
cost of hauling and price per yard for
the gravel. Many of our people were
surprised and were loath to believe
that it could be laid down on the road
side for such a low price. The gravel
was taken from the Henry Ohmer pit,
a distance of between three and four
miles of a haul. Notwithstanding all
these facts everybody was satisfied
with what they received for the gravel,
hauling, etc. In the epring, work will
be started and S3,C0i) will be spent on
the road east from Yale. Eater work
will start on the road west from this
city and 85,000 will be expended. We
then will have a long stretch of good
roads.
Our people may not know the fact
that supervisor, Norman H. Herbert,
has worked faithfully and untiringly
and deserves a great deal of credit in
securing the good roads into Yale. Of
course the county road commissioners
come in for their share, for through
them the money has been set aside for
this part of the county.
It means considerable to have 88,000
spent in this section. New wagons
were purchased, also feed for the horses,
employment given to teamsters and
laboring men, and in fact everybody ia
benefitted.
Minstrel Show a Winner.
When the High school Athletic As
eociation decided to give an entertain
ment for the amusement of the people
and for the purpose of filling in the
hole in its financial pocket, everybody
was eager to go because it was a fore
gone conclusion that it would be worth
going to.
Central hall was crowded, of course,
on Friday evening last, and the whole
program from beginning to end, was
completely satisfying to the audience.
Each number of the first part, as
published in the Expositor was more
than good, as evinced by the merited
apnlause. The second part consisted
of "the minstrel 6how proper by ten
highly colored young gentlemen who
performed their parts and did their
stunts as well as any regularly organ
ized minstrel company.
The boys made good at both ends of
the proposition, entertainment and
finance, and are well satisfied with
their venture, having some seventy-five
dollars after expenses are paid.
A nice little dance after the show
finished up a pleasant evening.
M. P. Church Notes
. Rkv. Chas. Hkago, tastou
There were no evening services in
our church last Sunday. All who could
attended the union service in the Pres
byterian church. The splendid ad
dresses given by the pastors of the
various churches were well worth
hearing.
Our Ladies' Aid has been doing good
work'this winter. The last meeting was
held in the basement and was well at
tended. A 10 cent dinner was served
to which the ladies' husbands and
children were invited. $6.00 was real
ized from the dinner and a fine amount
of work was done. This week the
ladies' meet with Mrs. 1. Martin.
A meeting of the officers of both
church and Sunday school was called
last Monday evening to discuss the
problems and work of the same.
We hope to see the usual goodly
number out to' our prayer service next
Thursday evening.

- My Dear Sir: 1 am answering your
Inquiry made to into over the telephone
this morning.
As 1 understand your remarks, you
have been informed or thought that I
had given advice that the primary
election recently held in your city was
illegal.
1 wish to most emphatically state
that I have not been asked for, and
have not given to any person an opin
ion of any kind about this primary. I
was asked by the Times-Herald whit
the statute was that provides that pri
mary elections shall be held at least
twenty days before the election. My
opinion was a general one, and did not
apply to any particular case.
I have no knowledge as to how your
primary was held, so you will see, as
far as 1 know, It was legal and regular.
I have endeavored to make myself
clear and you may make this letter pub
lie, If you so desire. Yours truly,
Shirley Stewart

Important Notice to the Farmers.
Don't lose any time. The seed corn
situation is critical. In Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Michigan, the Dakotaa and
Northern Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska
very little of the corn matured last
year and is unfit for seed. All corn
growers should select the best matured
corn and test every ear before planting.
We have bulletins of the seed corn sit
uation by P. G. Holden, director of the
Agricultural Extension Department,
International Harvester Co., which ex
plains fully how to teet every ear be
fore planting at a cost of not more
than ten cents per acre. Kindly call
and get one and help the corn situation
