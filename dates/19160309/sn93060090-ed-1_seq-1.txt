Dear Sir. let me sneak to vou.
As .vour letter .Informs me that I
should discontinue, sending you

not only to you, bub to you and
your Uhvych of Humanity. The
paper called "The Truth About
God and Life" published month
ly. Which is said to contain the
late discoveries of W.. H. Kerr
staling that the universe
contains no real God No real
Christ And that death is the
endofevegy man. And that jnan
contains np soul., Aad all that is
taught from the stand point of a
God of the universe is mystical.
We shall quote from one of the
numbers, those few lines.
"This Littlti Educator is dis
tributed by the Church ef
Humanity to introduce to all
people Kerr's Great Discoveries
in Nature that the Universe
contains no real God. that man
contains no Soul, and that Life
is ended forever in each person
at death that all God s Saviors.
Suls, Saints. Devils, Spirits,
Angels, Heavens, Hell, Purgatc,
ry, Etc. are purely Mythical,
having no real existence what
even in Nature. This Church has
over 300 enrolled .members in
the United States and is duly
Organised and Incorporated to
each these Discoveries."
Wdmust say right here, that
in our estimation if ever there
wa a disgraceful belief and
teaching in those United States

The Jingoes give China as an
example of unpreparedne3,
Good enough, China is the old-

nations of the earth, China fur
nishes an example of psrma
nence among nations. China
and its institution have out lived
every thing else in the world.
China prepared a wall of de
fence 1500 miles long and 25
feet thick at the base, and 15
feet thick at top. .
There is 'quite. 'a contrast in
China and the United States,
China prepared with a stone
and brick wall for national de
fence. China had been a nation
for five thousand years, Other
nations hve risen1 and decayed.
Their preparedness, was based
on the shot and shell, plan which
is advocated by Woodrow , Wil
son. China's wall of brictr. Wil
son's wall of battleships - and
cannon, China's wa)l was built
215 years beforerist." "Now
mostly in ruin. A wall of navy
of ammunition and arms has
never been permanent, if we
are to believe history, 1 am glad
to be in a class with the. Chinese
if they are peaceful: They are
more desireable1 than the t Jingo,
Coolie or no Coqlie. 'The Jingo
would have other people do all
preparing and, all the defending
all the fighting, ad the dying.
While in reality they had noth
ing materially to defend, Not
even honor or; principle.
As a nation of Christians', we
must prepare to .lefend our
selves, with with the Truth,
which is more powerful than the
sword or bavonet. The Truth
will overcome the lie, it will van
quish the ignorance of the mass
es, it will create a new man with
io, it will cast out the bad idea,
and let the good ideo enter in
stead. It will give mai the
Second Birth, it will make man
free.

as the sun is light to tne eye

All instruments for human disS
truction are necessarily false
and bad, dark and sinful.

We are proud that Bro. Coonce
has taken up the Two Man
Theory politicaly; We have at
times spoken of the great divi

The lords and the slaves. The
two classes have sprang from
the One Man Theory. Set up by
Martin Luther which was that

was the first man created. The

put in force there vill be no rich
class and poor class, and lords
and slaves; which the One Man
Theory has given us, tbat is
the two classes that the brother

"Oh Spring bas come to stay.''
Oh tra la la la lee I Sing; "Tra la la la ,,lee!"
Yours in ecstacy, C. B, C. .,.-
