APPLAUSE IS OF MANY KINDS
But There’s No Mistaking the Genuine
Article, When It Is Heard, Says
Victor Murdock.
With nearly every successful ad
dress applause plays a leading part,
writes Victor Murdock in Collier’s
Weekly. There are several varieties
of applause. The common variety is
the perfunctory handclap—a poor,
weak contribution which makes a but
terfly look long lived in comparison.
A second variety is the charity offer
ing of an audience to the oratorical
beggar.
The speaker ends a profound decla
ration with a pause which Is next door
to an open declaration of war if the
audience doesn't come across. Or he
works himself up In a series of mental
paroxysms which impel the auditors
to rush to his rescue before It is too
late. All spellbinders pocket this va
riety of applause as real coin. Of
course it is nothing of the kind.
The genuine issue in laudation is a
spontaneous and volcanic eruption ol
approval and delight. It blows out
violently from the subterranean fires
of folk, and when it has reached Its
climax there comes, suddenly and gor
geously from the midst of it a second
and more terrible explosion, and as
this is reaching Its highest point, a
third and seismic spasm rockets up
through bedlam and overwhelms ev
erything and everybody. This is the
real thing. It cannot be made to or
der and It cannot be counterfeited.
The prearranged outbursts at national
political conventions following the
nominations are pitiable attempts to
manufacture it. Claques and coteries
of devotees try occasionally to pro
duce it mechanically. They never do
successfully.
All veteran speakers know It, and
having experienced it. live on In the
bright expectancy of the golfer who
has accidentally driven 275 yards and
believes that any minute it is liable
to be done again. There are many
communities which have never wit
nessed such a scene. They never will.
For there are some communities that
are strangers to all manner of re
sponse.
Rum and Mahogany.
What will the schooners, laden with
New England rum for West Africa,
bring home? That question may have
puzzled many who have noted the
strange revival of the rum tradlc that
used to flourish in the slavery days. It
may have been thought that the rum
paid for the round voyage. A four
masted schooner, the first to go out,
has now returned to Boston with 486,-
673 feet of mahogany In logs from
West Africa, a cargo of no small
value. The round voyage has con
sumed seven months, the loading of
the mahogany being a slow process
owing to the indolence of West Afri
can labor. At the dock was another
capacious windjammer ready to sail
with 200,000 gallons of ruin, 1,500 bar
rels of flour and other things that the
natives seem to be In need of. As
many as six sailing vessels have en
tered this trade since last spring.—
Providence Journal.
Last "City Poet."
Elkanah Settle, a copy of whose
rare "Augusta Trlumphans” has just
been presented to the Guildhall li
brary, is forgotten by an ungrateful
posterity, but was once a prominent
personage In the literary world at Lon
don, and considered a serious rival to
Drydcn, by whom he Is satirized as
"Doeg.” He was the last of the "City
Poets,’’ retained at a salary of $3O a
year to perpetrate triumphal odes for
Lord Mayor’s day. and similar
pageants; and his verses, as Wilkes
observed to Doctor Johnson, matched
the queerness of his names. Settle
was a most prolific poetaster, but
somehow never prospered, though he
repeatedly turned his coat in religion
and politics. Ho was reduced to play
ing "tho green dragon" at Bartholomew
fair, and died a poor brother of the
Charterhouse.—Westminster Gazette.
Traveling Men Talk Too Much?
There may be someone who has won
dered why traveling salesmen or
“drummers" are such great story tell
ers. There’s a reason.
The traveling salesman who has a
good sense of humor, who can tell a
good story and who reads good litera
ture is bound to succeed, according to
Prof. E. J. Swift, psychologist of
Washington university, who talked be
fore business men at the Cabanne
branch library. His subject was "The
Qualities of a Salesman.’’
Professor Swift also said that moat
traveling men talk too much and that
the sniiie and handshake is overdone.
The salesman is too polite, the lec
turer said, and should learn to be a
good listener, and talk “with" and no*
"at” a man.—St. Louis Star.
Weds, Has 192 Grandchildren.
W. B. Davis, ninety four years old
and father of 41 children, 33 of whom
are alive, was married in Cabool, Mo.,
to Mrs. Macon, thirty-nine years old.
Twenty children and more than 100
grandchildren of the bridegroom at
tended the wedding. Davis has 192
grandchildren and several great-grand
children. This is his fourth venture
in matrimony. He is enjoying good
health, but has complained of being
lonesome. —Springfield (Mo.) Dispatch

rying a widow?"

ALL “GO HOME” SOME TIME
To Every Inmate of Prison the Period
of Freedom Arrives, Either in
Life or Death.
Some day—it we live, and there
doesn’t seem to be much chance of
dying around here —we are going out
and going home, says a writer in the
New Era, Federal penitentiary, Leav
enworth.
Even the man who happens to die
here is going home, for that matter.
It may seem slow, but the time
comes eventually for the last ’’get-up”
in prison for every man here. Then
it’s hike!
It’s over to the tailor shop for new
clothes from head to foot —and then
out and away. No bird will bo freer
than you and I, but we’ll not fly high
any more. One will start in one direc
tion and one in another. What’s the
difference? Any road leads to free
dom and the main chance.
We shall have the right to work and
to carry our wages in our pockets
again or put the money in the bank.
We shall drink freedom from every
water cup, and breathe in liberty from
the air itself. We can got off a dis
tance and yell out loud without fear
of a calldown.
We can sit and talk it all over at
the dinner table with friends and rel
atives. No more hands out for pota
toes. Some of these days we will tuck
a napkin under our chin again and
make merry over our pudding. Wo
Shull go to bed at night with lights
out and know the balm of darkness
to the eyes and enjoy the rest it gives
the optic nerve.
The day will roll ’round for us to
say good-by and go, with heads up -
not down.
No more will we fee! the weight of
bondage or know (he pinch of confine
ment. Everything we do, it will bo
our pleasure to do, and not our task.
We will cast off fetters, not put them
on.
We shall despise and fed a horror
for anything that curtails our liberties.
Habits that make slaves of men will
be cast aside, for while serving a
prison sentence we are freed of habits
that bind us more than any privilege
withdrawn here. Wo will not be
slaves to strong drink. Wo will go out
free from its awful bondage. Its
curse is removed far from us.
We shall not bo tempted to profane
our lives with evil deeds so long re
moved from their commitment. Wo
will go out more free from shackles
than we have been in years, for bud
habits aro tho hardest shackles to
strike from us.
Made Bachelor Pay for Wife
A delicate question was recently de
cided by an alderman of Wilkes-Barre,
I’a., when be was called upon to ad
judicate as to how much it is worth to 1
find a wife for a bachelor, who is anx
ious to step from bachelorhood into
the bliss of married life. Opportunity
to determine this question came when
a woman brought suit against a man
to recover $ 100 which she alleged was
promised her for finding a w ife for de
fendant after ho hail failed in his hunt
for a life partner. She claimed that
he had expressed great disgust with
his condition of bachelorhood and en
gaged her to hunt him a wife. She lo
cated a woman, introduced her to him
and their marriage resulted. Follow
ing the marriage the husband refused
to pay the SIOO he had promised. The
alderman, w ho is a bachelor, ruled that
It was well worth SIOO to find a wife
for a bachelor, and he gave judgment
'or the lull amount of the claim.
State Control in England,
A remarkable scheme of state con
trol has been Inaugurated at a cen
ter in the north of England where 2i),-
000 men arc expected to bo at work
shortly on munitions. To provide for
them the government has acquired all
shops In the district, and will either
allow the late proprietors to sell goods
under license only or will in most
eases run them under direct control.
The government will thus be butchers,
bakers, grocers and milkmen to the
Inhabitants. The main object is to
regulate prices and prevent extortion.
The liquor control board has already
bought all the public houses —about
thirty in number —and has thus a
monopoly in the district. In some the
sale of intoxicants will continue under
dose restrictions; in others it has
been suspended, and some have been
turned into lodging houses for work
men.
This Picture and That,
"The populations of the Boer, or far
mer republic of South Africa, and of
Mississippi have not been unlike, ex
cept in language,” says Senator John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi.
"Both lead plain lives; both alike
have their strength constantly re
newed, as was that of Antaeus of old,
by daily contact with their mother
earth.
"Both shoot well, ride well, live an
outdoor life and. as a rule, speak can
didly without diplomatic frills. Both
have their negro race problem and an
overruling race pride molding, color
ing, motiving or modifying nearly
everything—politics, religion and so
cial life. Both have combined grim
humor with cool courage.”
Refractory to Anesthesia,
Red Cross surgeons find that French
soldiers are refractory to anesthesia,
it taking far larger quantities than
usual of chloroform or ether to "put
them asleep.” This is believed to be
due to their habit of drinking wine
freely and smoking cigarettes inces
santly. So when operating on them
the surgeons see that they have their
customary wine and cigarettes.

(Copyright, 1916. by W. G. Chapman.)
"I never imagined human nature
could ever be like this,” said Rev
John Saunders to Miss Mary, the ma
tron at the Shelter society's head
quarters.
Miss Mary smiled upon him with the
dignity of five and twenty years, four
of which had been spent In the so
ciety’s service.
"1 guess it's the same everywhere,
Mr, Saunders," s’' n cos we- d lightly,
mentally registering her pity that a
young man of her own ago should
know so little of life. In fact, Mr.
Saunders, who had come straight to
the chaplain's post from the theolog
ical seminary, are di i, ore, was. in
comparison with herself, a child.
Mins Mary had evinced rv decided
partiality for U ;v. i,n. maunders. He,
himself, was not Indifferent to her.
In the secrecy of Ins heart he had
even dared to dream things relating
to a little home somewheo, when ho
got his coveted post in a small town,
far from the noise of the lower East
side. In this home, like a presiding
genius, was enthroned Miss Mary
Pagshaw, with a changed name. What
Miss Mary thought, must not bo re
vealed. Hut she thought a good deal
of him.
"If I could advise it. Mr Saunders.”
said Miss Mary, "I wouldn't he quite
so eager to save these men's souls.
They’re pretty hardened, some of
them. They want example more than

coming here, he was a hardened drunk

And he's quit swearing. Well, Mr.

about salvation. 'Never mind his soul

forehce in conditions by example.
And any day he may come up to the
mercy seat.' Well, Mr. Saunders, 'Red'
Larrigan Is a far different man from
what he was, and, mark you, the day
will come when you'll finish what Mr.
Harrison began.”
She spoke with great earnestness,
hut the young clergyman was not con
vinced. He, too, had noticed a dif
ference In Larrigan, even during that
month. His heart was burning to pull
this piece of human wreckage out of
the mire. Then there was "Blister”
Mike. Mike was a regular hobo who
put Into the mission during the winter
and found subsistence in return for
some very meager work at the wood
pile.
On the next evening both these
characters being in attendance, Mr.
Saunders took the opportunity for a
little private talk with each.
The results were disconcerting,
"Rod” relapsed. Ho uttered an oath.
"Five years I’ve been coming here,
Mr. Saunders, and nobody never said
a word about religion to me,” ho com
plained, greatly aggrieved. "I dunno
what to make of it. Seems to me it
ain’t fair on a guy.” And he ended
with a threat, which ho had no inten
tion of carrying out, of transferring
his patronage elsewhere.
“UliStor” listened with the same
sense of a grievance, but Mr. Saun
ders got, only vague promises out of
him.
Ho did not notice how the two down
and-outs put their heads together aft
er the meeting, while they supped
their coffee and munched the slabs of
bread and butter with which the mis
sion provided them.
It was some days later that Mr.
Saunders was amazed, after the serv
ice, to receive a voluntary visit from
"Blister.”
“Ves, my dear fellow, what can I
do for you?” he inquired, laying his
hand upon the hobo's shoulder.
"I want to tell you, mister, your
words went straight to my heart,”
said “Blister. ’ “And it made me feel
what you said—-we got to square our
selves. I’m wanted in Chicago."
"Wanted, Blister—l mean Mike?”
“Bigamy,” said “Blister” laconically.
‘You have committed bigamy?"
"And arson. That’s what they
called it. I burned down our home to
get rid of my old woman. She beat it.
Else it would have been murder aa
well.’’
“Dear me!" muttered the young
man, staring hopelessly at the tramp.
"My dear fellow, you—of course you’re
going to give yourself up to the po
lice.”
"Police?” shouted "Blister.” “If I
wanted to do that I could have done
it any time the last three years. No,
what I want is to get square, to be for
given.”
For half an hour Mr. Saunders plead
ed with him in vain. “Blister" appar
ently had no intention of paying the
penalty of his crimes, and at last
stalked oif in a huff—to admit “Red."
"Mr. Saunders,” "Red” began, “I
been thinking over your words about
getting square, and I want to tell you
something that’s been preying on my
mind for years.” "Red” could talk
quite well if he tried to. "Four years
ago I killed a man!”
"Killed a man!” echoed the young
minister, staring at this new coniidant
in absolute horror.
“Yep, in Chicago," said "Red.” "It
was while I was engaged in a little
private affair —well, sir, a burglary.
He was an old guy, too, turned eighty,
I believe. 1 smashed his head in
with my Jimmy. He shouldn't have
interfered, at his age, unless he'd had
a thicker head. But, Mister Saun
ders. his last look has haunted me to
my dying day. I want to get square.”
John Saunders placed both his
hands on “Rod’s" shoulders and
looked him earnestly in the eyes.
"There is only one way in which
you can square and make atonement
for your past," he said.
"1 knew it!” shouted "Red" exultant
ly. "Name it. I'll do it.”
"I will pay your fare back to Chi
cago,” answered the clergyman.
"Red’s” jaw dropped. “What In
blazes would I want to go back to Chi
cago for’” he asked. "I had trouble
enough getting away.”
To give yourself up and satisfy the
law," said Mr. Saunders. ‘‘That is the
only way in which you can square
yourself."
"I won’t. 1 fell you,” shouted "Red.”
"And you won’t snitch on me, neither.
1 come to you and told you that in
confidence. I come to you to get
square and you want to kill me!”
And ho (lung himself out of the
clergyman’s presence, leaving Mr.
Saunders white and shaking.
All that night he thought over his
predicament. Hero were two of his
flock, one a murderer, the other with
two atrocious crimes unpunished.
Both were repentant: neither was
willing to pay the price of forgiveness.
What should he do? Could he betray
them?"
Ho was too sick to get up that
morning. In the afternoon he rose
and dressed: just as ho had complet
ed his toilet there came a tap at the
door and Miss Mary stood revealed,
carrying a tray on which a hot lunch
was smoking.
“I was afraid you were 111, Mr. Saun
ders, when you didn't come down to
breakfast," she explained. "I hope it
is nothing much?”
In spite of the weight upon the
young man’s mind he could not help
thinking that ho would like to catch
this vision and keep her to be his for
ever.
Miss Mary set down the tray and
came toward him, holding out her
hands impulsively. "You are in trou
ble.” she said. “Tell me what it is.”
Ho told her. sick and trembling.
When he had finished he asked for her
advice. But to his amazement Miss
Mary was actually smiling—smiling,
while the tears stood in her eyes.
"Oh Mr. Saunders!” she exclaimed.
"You didn’t believe a word those two
dreadful liars said? Why, I saw them
plotting together last night. They are
both highly respectable men, of their
kind, except for drink and shiftless
ness. Mr. Saunders, they wanted to
give you something to occupy your
mind, that’s all. They tried that trick
with Mr. Harrison once. You speak
to them and you’ll find out.”
The young man gasped. "Are you
sure, Miss Mary?” he demanded, seiz
ing her hands again.
“Dead sure,” she answered. And
suddenly a silence tell between them.
“Miss Mar)’,” said John in an al
tered voice, “I am a fool. I need
someone to look after me. Will you—
won't you—will you try, dear?”
And Miss Mary promised that she
would.
Say “Women,” Not “Ladies.”
Don't say “ladies,” please; don't
draw that distinction. Ladies belong
to the past; the Victorian period saw
the last of them, writes Jane Cowl In
the Washington Times.
Modern womanhood is something
nobler, and it has for its ideal, “sis
terhood,” the equality of women with
out class distinction; that is the new
note in our life. Women, the world
over, have come to recognize their du
ties toward each other. The fine lady
is no longer respected for merely be
ing a fine lady; she is more honored
for what she does for the poor, unfor
tunate members of her sex. The finest
women in our great, glorious land
have reached out and given a helping
hand to unhappy girls like Ellen Neal
in “Common Clay.” A new spirit of
sisterly love prevails among all wom
en, which is to do great things for
civilization in the future.
In the Vernacular.
“You say Mr. Dubwalte was detained
in town last night by business?” asked
the visitor.
“Yes.” replied Mrs. Dubwaite, in a
slightly sarcastic tone. “Business of
trying to look pleasant when bis
strongest card was a two-spot.” _
LAID TO REST AMID POMP
Soldier’s Funeral Is One of the Most
Impressive Ceremonies That Can
Be Imagined.
Fort Myer is at the entrance of the
National cemetery at Arlington and
troops of the garrison a< as escort at
mflltary funerals. Once seen, the sol
emn ceremony is never quite forgot
ten. I chanced to he at the garrison
a few weeks ago when the burial of
a brigadier general took place with
lull military honors. When the fu
neral cortege entered the military res
ervation, cannon boomed out a sol
emn announcement of the approach.
Distant strains of a grand dirge came
faintly up from the valley* below and
mingled with the salute fired by the
battery at staled intervals. Nearer and
nearer it came, until down the broad
avenue under trees brilliant in au
tumn foliage, the funeral cortege broke
Into view. It was led by the mounted
band and hundreds of cavalry and ar
tillerymen on finely caparisoned
horses. At the gate of the cemetery
a hail was made and the great mili
tary escort spread out into a semi
circle. In the background was the
row of cannon from which the salute
had been fired, the smoke still rising
in soft curling clouds. The baud played
an impressive military dirge. The glit
tering tips of 40U sabers painted sky
ward in the sunlight as the cavalry
stood at attention, man and horse alike
immovable, while the caisson bearing
the Hag draped casket passed through
the gates of Arlington, preceded by a
platoon from the garrison which was
to fire the last volley. The simple com
mittal service became at once dra
matic At the close three volleys were
fired over the grave; the clear notes
of a bugle sounded ‘Taps.” Then fol
lowed a moment of stillness that was
Inexpressively profound, and the sol
emn ceremony was ended.
Dut there are no somber trappings
of woe in a military funeral. In their
place is a glitter of gold lace and bril
liant uniform; the flash of saber and
sound of martial music. And the Stars
and Stripes blot out the gloom and
give a patriotic splendor to the scene.
—“Training the Trooper,” Mrs. George
F. Richards, in National Magazine.
PLACE OF DUST IN NATURE
Wrongly Considered Nuisance, This
World Would Be Bleak Indeed
Without It.
Nothing is so useless as dust, you
say. The old burial ritual, “Dust unto
dust,” typifies the total absence of
value considered to lie In the parti
cles of earth.
But this dust that you kick and re
gard as an annoyance is really indis
pensable as well as ornamental. It
beautifies nature, since it, swimming
In the air, is responsible for the blue
of the sky. Without It there would b'e
no beautiful sunsets or sunrises. Des
erts and mountains would be colorless
without it to break up the light ray s
In the atmosphere. Wallace, the natu
ralist, says: “One-half the beauty In
the world would vanish with the ab
sence of dust.”
So much for the picturesque quali
ties. Far more Important Is Us char
acteristic of giving us diffused day
light. Without dust the sky would
appear to be completely black and the
stars on all sides of the sun would
be shining brightly.
The tiny particles flying in the air
halt and shatter the solid light rays
of the sun and spread them over a
wide territory. There wohld be pain
ful scorching light in the direct play
of the sun and blackness everywhere
else, in the front yard there would
be glaring sun and inside the bouse
midnight blackness. Our lives would
be totally different were there no dust.
We should have by necessity grown
Into different beings. Plants and ani
mals would be in nothing like their
present form. The instant the sun
sank there would be total blackness.
Twilight and dawn would have never
been known, and the times which *
ence says are the most restful ~nd
soothing periods of the day would bo
left out.
Mothers and Wars.
After leaving school 1 do not think
that women of the non-possessing
classes owe the state any other kind
of service than they are already giv
ing.
The life of the working woman,
loaded with the treble tasks of mother,
housewife and breadwinner, Is more
than burdened, and It is a great in
justice not to consider motherhood a
perfect compensation for any war
service of men.
The men who fight battles are the
sons of mothers; the death of every
one wounds a mother’s heart, and sad
ness of war is so heavily felt by the
women of any country that many of
them would rather give their own
lives than those of their sons.—Adele
Schrelber, In Health Culture.
Wandering Bird.
The great albatross deserves to be
called the wandering albatross. A
mounted specimen is preserved In one
of our museums of a bird which, when
captured off the coast of Chile, on De
cember 20, 1847, had a small vial hung
on a string about Us neck. This vial
contained a piece of paper, from which
it was learned that the bottle had been
attached to the bird on December 12,
1847, by the captain of a whaling ves
sel when It was about eight hundred
miles off the coast of New Zealand.
The blyd, therefore, traveled at least
3,400 miles In eight days.—Frank Chap

VISITING FRIENDS iN DREAMS
English Experimenter Asserts That it
Can Be Done Through the Ex
ercise of Will Power.
That a person can visit distant
friends and see what they arc doin '
If one only wills to do so, is the state
ment of an English experimenter in
the mystery ot dreams. It is appa
rently a kind of “dream" telepathy I. ■
cause to carry it out successfully both
parties must be willing to receive or
to transmit the message. Curlmiu
enough, who is to be the transmitter
and who is to be the receiver can only
be decided when the experiment is
carried out. The following is an ex
ample of the strange means of com
munication which was carried out as
an experiment:
The experimenters were a lady ami
a gentleman. They were friends, hut
not in any way related, nor wo re 11. y
lovers. The man lived In London and
was a bachelor; the lady in Liverpool.
They mutually agreed that on u con
tain night, at a given hour, they would
try to see in sleep what the other
was doing and what were the on
roundings ot each. The man went, to
sleep in London, as usual, ami
dreamed not at all, although trying to
do so. In the morning lie decided that
the experiment had failed.
What was his surprise, however, to
get a letter from his friend in Liver
pool the following day, in which she
gave an account of all his acts before
he went to bed, amt described bis
room accurately, even to the detail
of a brown, well-worn carpet being
mended with a bit of scarlet felt, i-'ho
had never been in his rooms nor heard
what they were like, yet she was able
in a dream to see in Liverpool v.iiat,
he was doing in London. How ii was
that she could see when ho could not,
has yet to be discovered.
This dream sight would be of much
comfort at the present time when one
longs to know if the dear ones, at the
war are safe, and doubtless the sol
diers would be cheered by a visum of
those at home. Thus telepathic dream
ing might be worth while cultivating:
hut to be successful it must be quite
natural. The will power must be under
the complete control of the sleeper,
and not interfered with by any out
side intelligences, and both parties
must arrange the hour they intend to
put the experiment into practice.
Paper Bags for Breastwork.
Owing to the limited supply of cot
ton In Germany the sand bags used in
constructing breastworks are now be
ing made of specially-prepared paper,
according to the Wall Street Journal
Experience lias proved that these new
paper bags are much superior to cot
ton bags for durability, and cost less.
After cotton bags have been in use
for some time they wear out from ex
posure and must be replaced. The cut
ton bags are now being replaced by
paper bugs. These new hags have
been scientifically prepared, are water
proof and may bo used over and over
again, being practically indestructible.
Millions of these bags are being us !
in place of the cotton ones, which
means quite a saving both in cotton
and cost.
Eat Chicken for Moral Tone.
Prof. M. E. Jaffa, the nutrition ex
pert of the University of California,
has declared that different sorts ot
food have distinct, but varying effects
upon the moral character of human
beings, the San Francisco Bulletin
states.
"If one eats chicken exclusive ly it
brings out the finest qualities of the
person's higher nature,” he said,
“The light foods, such as vegetables,
tend to make an esthetic. On the other
hand, beef brings out the quality ot
savagery.
"I once knew an actor," lie added,
“who always ate large quantities of
beef before playing a heavy tragic
role. He found the added savagery
aided in his dramatic portrayal. ’
Knitting Under Difficulties.
Miss Li ias Trotter ot the Algiers
Mission b,,nd writes that the native
classes that used to work on native
embroidery and lace at the different
stations of the mission in North Af
rica have now, in view ot the Euro
pean war, resolved themselves into
more Immediately useful knitting
classes fo: the Red Cross.
“The children took vigorously to
the new craft, even though knitting
needles had to be long nails or um
brella ribs. Yarn proved as scarce
as needles, so we started spinning it
from sheep fleeces, thus giving em
ployment t the older women for w hom
times were hard.”
Traasvaal Gold Output.
The gold output from the Transvaal
the last year has outrun all records.
The total yield is 9,003,671 ounces, the
value of which is $187,916,473. Tho
output in 1914 was 8,394,322 ounces,
and for 1913 about the same. Tho war
demand for gold has stimulated min
ing enterprises, and it was known
early In 1915 that there would be an
unusually large yield. The returns for
the first six months of 1915 showed a
return of 4,408,050 ounces, valued at
|90,865,C0Q.
Fate's S-übstitution.
“The things we fear most never
happen,” said the optimist.
“Yes,” replied the pessimist, “hut
we generally get something equally
bad.”
Musically Speaking.
‘What kind of an apartment did the
singer get?”
“I suppose nothing less would sat
tefy her than a suite thine in A fiat.”
