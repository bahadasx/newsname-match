Other parliamentary experts In tho

CRISIS AS RESULT OF
INVASION OF U. S. SOIL
One Woman Among Victims of Villistas;
, Fifty to 100 Bandits Shot Down By
Troopers Before They Are Driven
From Town.
Eleven Americans, including four United States
soldiers, were killed and five wounded in an invasion of
American soil by 400 Villista soldiers early today.
Press dispatches and official reports to the Jar De
partment agree in all essential facts on the first real inva
sion by Mexican bandits of United States soil.
Fifty to one hundred of the invaders were killed
by the soldiers and civilians who took part in the two'
hours' fight before the Villistas were routed.
Columbus, N. M., was the scene of the battle. The
invaders swooped down on the sleeping town just before
daybreak, firing into houses and applying the torch to
scores of buildings.
As the inhabitants, panic-stricken, poured into the
streets the Mexicans shot them dovn, and when the United
States troops, under the command of Col. Herbert Slocum,
attacked a fierce battle ensued.
A running battle to the border followed, but the ban
dits escaped into Mexican territory, taking back a number
of United States cavalry horses.
Official circles view this latest outrage in the gravest
light. In view of the number of invaders and the fact that
Columbus is well back from the border line the interna
tional complications are the most serious that have yet
arisen.
An outbreak in Congress is expected hourly. Stirred
by the latest outrage both Senator Fall and Senator Borah
are said to be lining up facts for an attack on the Admin
istration policy.
The strict enforcement of American rights on the high
seas with an opposite policy on the Mexican border will be
the center of the Fall attack.
In Administration circles it is said that strong repre
sentations will be sent Carranza.
Raid Recognized
As an Attempt to
Bring Intervention
An official report from General Funs-
ton giving the details of the Villista at
tack on Columbus, N. M., brought a new
Mexican crisis squarely before official:
today.
Tills attnek, the first serious Invasion
of American soil during the years of
Mexican revolution raised a serious is
sue which officials realize may change
the course of the Administration's action
in dealing with the Mexican situation.
The invasion was recognized as an at
tempt on tho part of Villa to fono
American Intervention.
After receiving the report Newton D.
Baker, who had Just previously Deen
sworn In us Secretary of War conferred
with staff officers. Secretary Baker
later sent the report to President Wil
ton. The first official report of the Inci
dent camp- from Major General Fun

on tho border. Ills telegram, sent from
Fort Sam Houston, said:
