New York, March 8.—Attorney A.
G. Koeble, president of the United
German societies, admits that the let­
ters reproduced in the World charg­
ing that the driving force back of the
Gore and McLemore resolutions in
the National German^American Alli­
ance were genuine, but asserted that
they were stolen and their meaning
perverted. He also said he would
ask the district attorney to take legal
action to compel the World to dis­
close how it carat' in possession o'
them.
Certain of the letters were written
by former Congressman Richard liar
tholdl of St. Louis, who suggested a
"boom" for Champ Clark for presi
ident in New York, adding that prob
'ably he would be able to "set some­
thing in motion" in St. Louis. Other
letters were written by Leo Stern, a
prominent German-American of Mil­
waukee Henry Weissmann of the
German-American alliance T. J. Mar
salis, a real estate operator of New
York, and Dr. C. J. Hexamer of Phil­
adelphia, president of the German
American alliance.
Mr. Koelble expressed the belief
that the World was the personal or­
gan of President Wilson and denied
that lie or any other German-Ameri­
can had fathered either the Gore or
tlie McLemore resolution, although
he "would consider it a great honor
tp do so."
,The World said that the new Ger­
man propaganda to influence con­
gress catoe into being "last December
following the return from Europe of
Mr. Koelble, who had been to Europe
in the interest1 of the German cause
here.
"That statement," said Mr. Koelble,
"is absolutely false. I did not go to
Europe for that purpose. I went
solely in the interest of my client*
Hans Schmidt, a murderer, recently
executed in Sing Sing."
IN WINTER EARNINGS
January Report Shows Dividend
Needs Surpassed, Revealing
Business Activity.
St. Paul. March 8.—The Northern
Pacific road broke every record in
January by earning money enough to
cover its dividend apportionment for
that period, and the showing is an
index to a condition of midwinter
business activity in the northwest
that is without precedent. Because
winter conditions make hard operat­
ing, hold down tonnage, and run up
operating cost, January is usually
considered a "deficiency" month by
'the Northern Pacific.
In January, 1915, the net earnings
were insufficient by $810,000 to pro­
vide for the dividend apportionment
for a 301day period. But in January
this year the road earned sufficient to
provide a net sum that covers the
dividend for the month and leaves
$171,000 over.
February's record showed heavier
leadings of tonnage on the system,
and it is expected that general offices
reported today that the gross and net
figures for February when available
will show a material increase over
the same montn last year.
MAY BUILD HOME
Glen Ullin, N. D., March 7.—If plans
and ideas advanced by members of
the local Camp of Modern Woodmen
can be brought to a realization. Glen
Ullin will have one of the finest lodge
and opera buildings in this .part of the
country.
For a long time the 'Modern Wood­
men have been considering the ad­
visability of erecting a home of their
own, but no action has ever been
taken. Recently the proposition of
either buying or building has been
freely discussed among the local
members and the organization of a
stock company composed of only
members of the local camp seems to
be the most popular as well as feasi­
ble plan.

Judge Gary
Indicted on
Trust Charge
Youngstown, O., March 8.—The Ma­
honing county grand jury today end­
ed the investigation of the strike
riots of January 27 in Youngstown
by returning an indictment against
Elbert H. Gary, chairman of the
United States Steel corporation, and
against six big steel companies.
The indictment charged Gary, the
corporation of which he is the head,
one of its subsidiaries and four inde­
pendent steel concerns with conspir­
ing to fix the wages of labor, and to
fix the price of iron and steel in Ma­
honing county, in violation of state
anti-trust laws.
"Judge Gary has been indicted,"
said County Progccutor A. M. Hender­
son, "because the evidence laid be­
fore the grand jury tends to show
that he is the director of the iron
and steel industry in the United
States."
"Combining in an unlawful trust"
is the condensed charge in the indict­
ment.
Prosecutor I-Ienderson tonight de­
clared the trial of Gary and six in­
dicted corporations would be held at
the end of the month.

EXPLAINS HIS FAILURE
TO LAND APPOINTMENTS
Fargo, March 8—
John Bruegger,
as a candidate for re-election as na­
tional committeeman for the demo­
cratic party in North Dakota, fighting
a combination of prominent demo­
crat*. wlip -are -backing the M. H.
Perry candidacy for the position, look
confidently to the outcome of the bal­
loting on March 21—insisting that
Mr. Bruegger's chance for re-election
is everything that they could wish
for, and that they are practically cer­
tain of the retention, by him, of his
present post.
In a bulletin issued here and given
general circulation among the demo­
cratic voters of the state, between 12,
000 and 15,000 of whom are expected
to go to the polls to vote on the com­
mittee job, the Bruegger interests
take the opposition to task for state­
ments made by the latter during the
campaign which has, in recent weeks,
taken on considerable heat.
That his opponents are attempting
to belittle his record in the matter of
"turn downs" by the departments at
Washington, in the matter of postal
and other federal appointments, is
one charge made against the Perry
forces by Bruegger, and this he an­
swers by the declaration that no na­
tional committeeman in any state has
a record of receiving so many accept­
ances of recommendations as has he.
New evidence on the question of
McArthur failure to land the post of
collector of customs is also set forth,
in the following manner:
McArthur Not Filed.
"Relative to the appointment of
Mr. Morrison as customs inspector,
the statements made are best answer­
ed in the words of Secretary McAdoo,
who stated, over hife own signature,
that none of the telegrams or pro­
tests which are credited with prevent­
ing appointment of Mr. McArthur for
this position had anything to do with
the action, neither could they have,
for Mr. McArthur had no application
on file for the position and at no time
did the secretary of the treasury con­
template sending his name to the
president.
"The rejection of Mr. Bruegger's
endorsement for this oflice or any of­
fice cannot reasonably be taken as
any evidence of his influence or lack
of inlluence with the administration.
There is not a national committee­
man in the country who has not had
similar experience.
"While a national committeeman
may recommend appointments, the
federal administration is not obliged
to accept them. However, since this
matter has been mentioned in an at­
tempt' to injure Mr. Bruegger, it is
fair to state that no national commit­
teeman has had a greater percentage
of his recommendations for office
recognized than has Mr. Bruegger.
Reference also is made to the ques­
tion of previous elections, the opposi­
tion attempting to use the vote of
four years ago as a basis for deter­
mining the probable strength of
Perry as against Bruegger.
Figures on Election.
With respect to the election of four
years ago, the Bruegger statement
says:
"The total vote cast in 1912 for the
office of national committeeman was
10,2H, of which John Bruegger re­
ceived 2,690, or lettle less than one
third George Duis, 2,053, practically
one-fifth: Frank Wilson, 1,821, little
better than ohe-sixth F. W. McLean.
1,065, less than one-eighth Ben
Whitehead, 922, not quite one-tenth.

OBEY RULES IF
THE ENGLISH 00
Memorandum Handed to Secre­
tary Lansing Latest Phase in
Negotiations.
SENATOR STONE DECIDES
TO POSTPONE HIS SPEECH
Declares Remarks Might Be Mis­
construed in Foreign
Capitals.
Washington, 'March 8.—Count von
Bernstorff today handed Secretary
Lansing a long memorandum explain­
ing in detail the German position in
regard to the armed merchant ships
and the causes leading up to the de­
cision of the central European
Began as Reprisa.l
The memorandum is also under­
stood to reiterate the previous decla­
ration that submarine warfare was
begun by Germany in reprisal for
the announced intention of Great Brit­
ain to starve the civilian population
df the central empires. The memo­
randum is also said to refer to the
long standing friendship of the Unit­
ed States and Germany, and to ex­
press the hope that the American peo­
ple will, when familiar with the ex­
planations offered, fully appreciate
the position which'Germany finds her­
self in as a result of the blockade.
Lansing now has before him the ap­
pendices to the announcement of the
new German submarine campaign,
which 'Germany contends will prove
that E'ritish merchant ships, armed
for defense, have been using their
guns offensively against submarines.
On the eve of the decision of how
the United States will regard the new
campaign the ambassador was in­
structed to discuss the question fully
with Lansing and outline Berlin's
views at length.
Germany's position is that the arm­
ed ship question is not connected with
the Lusitania negotiations, and the
state department's view is exactly op­
posite. It is considered probable,
however, that the Lusitania negotia­
tions, which have been held in abey­
ance while the congressional situa­
tion was disposed of, might be dis­
cussed again today.
The memorandum also expressed
the hope that the people of the Unit­
ed States, remembering the long ex­
isting frindly relation between the
two nations, would appreciate the
German position.
Submitted to Wilson.
The memorandum was submitted
to President Wilson shortly after its
receipt. It will be considered, to­
gether with other documents from
the German government, in determin­
ing what shall be the next step of
the United States in the submarine
negotiations.
There is every indication that, the
administration will be in no hurry
to announce a stand as to the new
policy of the central European pow­
ers, no'r to pass finally upon Ger­
many's latest proposal for a settle­
ment. of the Lusitania case.
Echoes of President Wilson's vic­
tory in the fight to end agitation in
congress over the armed ship ques­
tion were heard today on both sides
of the capitol.
Stone Cautious.
In the senate Senator Stone, chair­
man of the foreign relations commit­
tee, made a statement, after a con­
ference with the president, announc­
ing that because of the chances that
his remarks might be misconstrued
abroad, he would not make a speech
he had prepared for delivery tomor­
row.
From both the White House and
the state department there came dur­
ing the day emphatic denials of a ru­
mor that the administration itself in­
tended to warn American citizens not
to travel on armed merchantmen.

powers
to torpedo without warning all the
armed merchantmen of their enemies.
Lansing and von 'Bernstorff declin­
ed to divulge its contents. is un­
derstood to contain an allegation that
Great Britain had taken advantage
of the contention of the United States
that Americans must be safe on de­
fensively armed merchant men, to
have those ships act offensively to­
ward enemy submersibles.
The German government, it is un­
derstood, concedes that as subma­
rines are new engines of warfare,
international law as at present con­
stituted makes not provision for their
use. The 'German government is un­
derstood to express a willingness to
operate its submarines in accordance
with the international law prevailing
prior to the war, provided Great Brit­
ain does not violate the same laws.
It is also understood the memo­
randum contends the evidence ap­
pended to the late German announce­
ment proves that British ships, arm­
ed ostensibly for defense, have been
instructed to act and have acted of­
fensively, and that they are not peace­
ful traders, as the United States was
assured they would be by Sir Cecil

City of Fargo Grants Two
Days' Free Use of Audi­

MARCH 31 AND APRIL 1
ARE DATES ANNOUNCED
Politicians Looking Forward to
Action of This Organiza­
tion.
Fargo, March 8.—Probably the first
real test of the political strength of
the Non-Tartisan league will come
March HI and April 1, when a con­
vention will be held in this city to
determine the action the new organi­
zation is to take in state politics.
Many are inclined to reserve their de­
cisions as to the merit of the organi­
zation until this meeting.
"From 5,000 to 10,000 farmers will
be here to attend the lirst. state gath­
ering ever held by the Farmers' Non­
partisan league March 31 and April
1."
This was the statement made to­
day by 10. C. Coates, editor of the
Nonpartisan Leader, in commenting
on the state convention of the league,
official announcement of which was
made today for the first time. The
city of Fargo has donated the use of
the iFargo auditorium for two days,
There will be two great mass meet­
ings each day. The first day the
meetings will be held in the morning
and in the afternoon.
On Saturday there will be two
great mass meetings, afternoon and
evening.
"For over a year the farmers of
North Dakota have gathered in local
conventions thorughout the state and
have been told of the proposed plans
of the league," said Mr. Coa'tes. "An
intense .enthusiast? has -been created!
•fails will "be the first, time the farm?
ers will have had an opportunity to
get together, and meet all the officers
of the league at one time. Not only
the delegates, but every member of
the league is being urged to attend
this mass meeting. You may be sure
that there is going to be the greatest
mass meeting ever held in the state
of North Dakota.
"We have been assured that Fargo
will be pleased to entertain the far­
mers of North Dakota."
All the officers of the league will
be at the meeting and will deliver ad­
dresses, and there will be one or two
and possibly three of the best orators
in the United States to talk to the
farmers.
At a meeting of the city commis­
sioners held this morning E. C.
Coates, editor of The Nonpartisan
Leader, appeared before the body and
asked that free use of the auditorium
be granted to the Nonpartisan league
for its big state convention, which
will be held here on March 31 and
April 1.
.Mr. Coates explained to the com­
missioners that the meeting would be
a mass convention to which the pub­
lic was invited, and for which no
charge would be made, and Commis­
sioner Alex Stern moved that the city
pay for the use of the auditorium for
the two days. The resolution was
passed by a unanimous vote.
The convention will be attended by
delegates chosen from each county in
the state, and will be the big pre­
election session of the organization
for the purpose of making arrange­
ments for the part it is to play in the
coming primaries and general elec­
tion.

GERMANY MAKES DEMAND.
London, March 8.—'Unless the
German ships seized by Portugal
are released, the Portuguese min­
ister to 'Germany will reecive
his passports Saturday at noon,
according to a dispatch to the
Exchange Telegram of Zurich
Switzerland, which gives a re­
port from Frankfort as a basis
for the statement.
London, March 8.—The French, by
a strong counter attack today, suc­
ceeded in driving the Germans from
tiie greater part of the Corbeaux
wood, which they occupied yesterday
and, according to the official state­
ment issued by the war authorities
tonight, the Germans now hold only
the eastern extremities of this wood..
The Germans, however, have re
occupied the Hardmoiint. Douamont
to the north of Verdun is again being
heavily bombarded.
In the Champagne district the
•French have recaptured portions of
trenches lost March 6„ according to
a semi-official announcement made
here.
The situation north of Verdun
unchanged. No infantry attacks were,
made last night. Artillery fighting*
continues. France awaits apxiously
.tilt confidently
battle. .in' •*-..
The real struggle will begin when
the German masses hurl themselves
again on the four miles of heights ex-",
tending from Bethincourt to Cumi
eres.
Battle Unchanged.
Yesterday's- attacks left the battle:
unchanged., Corbeaux wood, in which
the*! Germans succeeded in establish­
ing themselves, is within a hollow be
tween Dead Man and Goose hills. A»
neither position is endangered, the
German success is of little strategic
importance.
It is known here that the Germans
have set aside 300,000 men to capture
Verdun. Ony 200,000 having been
employed up to yesterday, it is a
question whether the remaining 100,
000 will be used to make a sudden
descent on some other part of the
French line in developing the offens­
ive against the fortress.
A heavy attack west of the river,
however, leaves that question no long­
er to be settled. The impression of
members of parliament, who are kept
regularly informed as to the progress
of the battle, is that the defense will
be able to resist all onslaughts the
Germans will be able to make and
that Goose iHill on the left bank, will
play a role similar to 'Douaumont on
the right. It is expected the battle
will reach its climax tomorrow or
Friday. Not until then will it be pos­
sible to judge which way the battle
will go.
Germans Still Gaining.
The capture of a French position
west of the Meuse river on both sides
of the 'Forges brook, below Bethin­
court, six kilometers wide, and three
kilometers deep, is announced by the
German army headquarters. It is also
announced that the villages of Forges
and Regenville, the heights of Rabea
and also the Cumieres woods are in
the hands of the Germans.
The capture of '58 officers, 3,277 men
and ten cannon is officially reported.
In the Woevre district the French
were driven out of the last houses
they held in the village of Fresnes.
More than 700 prisoners were taken
there.
FLEET SIGHTED.
A German fleet consisting of at
least fifty great warships, followed by
large grey painted trawlers, two Zep­
