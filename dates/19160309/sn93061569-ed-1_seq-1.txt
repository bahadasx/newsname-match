FAMOUS BOOZE
CASEDECIDED
Judge Lleb Renders Decision in Case
that has been "Hair-splitting
Affair for Several Months.
In the District Court of the Eighth
Judicial District of the State of New
Mexico, Sitting Within and for the
County of Union.
E. J. Walters,
Plaintiff
-vs. No. 1799
T. J. Crumley, acting sheriff of Union
County, New Mexico,
Defendant.
OPINION
THIS CAUSE is now before the
Court on the motion of the defendant
to dissolve the temporary injunction
issued herein during the absence of
the judge of this court from the State,
A temporary order was issued re
straining the defendant from attempt
ing to close a saloon operated by
plaintiff in block 1050, of the town of
Clayton, New Mexico, which the de
fendant Sheriff claims was being op
erated illegally because within the dis
tance from the church prohibited by
Sub-section 18 of Section 3564 of the
Codification of the Laws of New Mex
ico, 1915.
The part of this sub-section which
is applicable to this case reads as fol
lows: "But no license shall be grant
ed for the sale of liquor within one
blocS or square of any church."
The saloon operated by the plaintiff
is at the north edge of block 1050.
The church in question in on the north
side of block 1051, some little distance
from the street. Block 1051 is direct
' lyVorth of 1050. Block 1051 together
with the street between it and block
1050 measures 330 feet The distance
between the church and the saloon
in question in a direct line is 289.6
feet. These various facts are before
the court by stipulation.
It is the contention of the plaintiff
that when the law says that "no
license shall be granted for the sale of
liquor within one block or square of
any church" it means that a license
could not be granted for the sale of
liquor at any point within the partic
ular block in which the church in
question may be located. That in the
case before the court, cs the church
is located in block 1051, no license
could be granted for the sale of liquor
any where in said block, but that such
license could be granted in any other
block,, no matter how close that would
bring a saloon to a church. With this
contention the Court cannot agree. If
that be the law, there could Be a row
of chuches on or e side of a narrow
trtei. and a row of mloons on the
other side, but a few feet apart We
would have a law so absurd as to
prohibit a saloon on one side of the
church for three hundred feet with
buildings located between, and on the
other side of the church to permit
them to be within a few feet with
the intervening space an open street.
Such cannot be a reasonable interpre
tation of the law.
The Court construes the law before
it to mean that each church is a center
of a prohibition district, whose radius
is a distance of one block or square
measured in a straight line, and that
in computing the length of such ra
dius the width of the street should be
taken into consideration. In reaching
this conculsion the Court is following
decisions rendered by the other courts
of other states where similar questions
have arisen. A like question was be
fore the Supreme Court of Louisiana
in State vs. Berard, 3 Southern 463.
. When the Court was considering a
statute of that state which prohibited
the keeping of private markets within
a radius of six squares of the public
market in New Orleanes, the Court
held that when the Legislature used
such language they had in view to
fix an equal and uniform distance in
order to avoid any arbitrary discrim
ination, and intended that the distance
should embrace both the length of the
squares and the width of the streets.
The Court says, "The inquiry is there-'
fore narrowed down as to whether the
width of the streets is or not to be
included in the disaitfe which the leg
islature fixes when it says that private
markets shall not be kept within a
radius of six squares of the public
market in the city. It is clear that
there can be no squares unless they
are divided by streets, and that the
pieces of ground which are termed
and designated as squares, in ordinary
parlance, when a distance is to be
staked, includes the streets." If this
be the proper interpretation of the
law, and this Court believes it is, then
this saloon maintained by the plaintiff
is within one block of a church, and is
therefore being operated in violation
of the law.
It goes without saving that no one
has a right to operate a saloon with
out a license. If the plaintiff has been
operating one in a place forbidden by
law, then he is in the same position
as if he were doing business without
a license. ' For whatever license he
may have had is void and of no effect,
and he would be subject to prosecution
under the law for the unlawful sale
of intoxicating liquors. The location
of his place of business being within
the distance prohibited by law from a
church, it naturally follows that no
one had any jurisdiction to grant him
a license.
That being true, the plaintiff is a
violater of the law, unintentionally it
may be, but a violater nevertheless.
Therefore, he cannot come before
court of equity and get it to assist him
in carrying on a business contrary to
law. There is no older nor familiar
maxim of equity than that "he who
comes into a court of equity must do
so with clean hands." Many courts
have called the saloon a "legalized
outlaw." If it be that when operating
usder. a license, with the cloak of lc
gality taken away it is an outlaw in
every sense of the word, entirely with
out the pale of the law, and can ob
tain no relief in a court of equity.
The temporary injunction heretofore
issued in this cause will therefore be
dissolved at the cost of the plaintiff,
DONE at Raton, New Mexico, this
2nd day of March, 1916.

GRAZING CASE
HASHEARING
Precedent Established in Important
that has been "Hair-splitting"
Raising.
In the case of James vs. Salas, in
which Mr. James sought to restrain
one Salas from pasturing his land
and damages in the amount of $1000,
the court granted the injunction, gave
to Mr. Salas a right of way to a public
road, denied the damages asked for
and assesed the costs against the de
fendant. This wat one of those pecu
liar cases that coiue up in every court
and that all may know the effect of
the court's decision as to the matter
of having a precedent established in
which one can be guided in such mat
ters in the future, it is necessary to
state some of the conditions that led
up to the suit. Mr. James is a large
ranchman. His land is enclosed. In
side of the enclosure Mr. Salas has a
homestead. Mr. James' land surrounds
it on all sides. Mr. Salas took the
liberty to pasture Mr. James premises
with sheep accompanied by a herder.
The court held that he had no right to
thus pasture Mr. James premises,
hence was a trespasser. It granted
Mr. Salas, however, right-of-way to
and from his homestead across Mr.
James' premises. The law provides
for what is known as and is, a lawful
fence. Stock of any kind breaking
through this fence and entering in on
and destroying crops or grazing would
be considered as trespassing and the
owner thereof liable for damages.
Stock entering land or premises not
lawfully fenced ot fenced at all,
if running at largeowner is not liable
for damages. Stock accompanied by
herder are not permitted on any prem
ises except as owned, leased or under
the control of the owner of the stock,
except by permission of the owner of
the premises.
It would appear from the decision
that if Mr. Salas would choose to turn
his stock loose unattended that they
would not be considered trespassing,
to graze Mr. James' land.
ONE WINDY DAY V
Sunday, March 6th, goes down in
history, our history, as the dirtiest
that we have experienced in Union
County. It was a real terror, and was
just as bad as Saturday was good.
The wind began blowing about eight
o'clock and by noon about all the real
estate that was lying loose had ex
changed hands, and some of it was
still on the move. All sorts of "pur
suing" spectacles were to be seen in
the early part of the day but before
night the program had changed, for
one could pick up a hat just most
anywhere. No use to chase one, pick
up another and go on. The week fol
lowing, so far, has been normal, which
for Union county is as fine weather
as we have ever seen anywhere. J
CUBBISON VS. DAVIS
The case of Paul K. Cubbison, of
Kansas City, Mo., vs. Mrs. Belty Davis
of Mosquero, N. M., this county, was
heard before Judge Lieb on March
8, and a verdict rendered in favor of
the plaintiff for $600.00, defendant to
pay the costs.
It seems that Cubbison purchased
a relinquishment of 320 acres of
homestead land together with all im
provements thereon about February
25, 1915, from Mrs. Davis, and paid
through his aunt, Mrs. Daisy Kings
bury, $175.00 in cash and its equival
ent, and gave a note for $425.00 to run
for one year from date. Paul Cubbi
son filed on the land, and went back
to Kansas City to prepare for his re
moval to land. He was threatened with
appendcitis before consummating his
arrangements, and felt he should stay
at his home where he could receive
proper medical attention and care. His
aunt, Mrs. Kingsbury, in the mean
time, had demanded possession of the
land in order to sink a well and build
the fence, but Mr. James D. Davis, the
husband, made several and various
threats, and stated he would not give
up the land until he was paid $200.00
Lfor his work and improvements. On
July 23, 1915, the husband contested
Cubbison, in order to secure the land
again, and made Desert Entry on 160
acres of it, which was not allowed by
the Clayton Land Office. In the mean
time he continued to use the land,
planting and garnering crops, and
herding his sheep thereon. Paul Cub
bison relinquished to the government
and J. B. Duvall filed as a homestead
find protested Davis' preference right.
The matter is now before the Wash
ington Land Office for settlement.
PRAIRIE FIRE
A very far-reaching prairie fire
swept over the country south of Clay
ton on Saturday of last week, con
tinuing for several days. The fire
originated, as near as we .have been
able to learn, some fifteen miles south
of town and the strong winds of Sun'
day swept it with terrible force, driv
ing it east and south east, in the di
rection of Hereford, Texas. Many
men were out for several days doing
all they could to stop its progress
but as long as the wind was blowing
a gale as it was on Sunday last, they
were of little or no avail. Many
barns, some houses and much hay and
feed was destroyed, but to date we
have learned of no loss of life, f
PIE SUPPER
A pie supper was billed for Satur
day night in the district known as the
Horn neighborhood, Mrs. Bywater
teacher, in which Supt. Errett, Prof.
Thompson, G. C. Smith and "Yours
Truly" were destined to play a part.
Mrs. Bywater is to be commended for
auctioneer of no mean ability and as
a bidder, (sometimes we thought he
tin' there." "In a beauty contest Mr.
Thompson and Mr. Errett ran like
quarter horses, with Mr. Thompson
taking the prize money. "Ye editor"
brings back no distinction except that
he enjoyed the privilege of eating pie
with the prettiest girl in the district.
Mrs. Bywater is to bo commended for
the excellent program she and the
pupils had prepared. Mr. Hanners
was prominent as "clerk" and in all
it was a most enjoyable affair and net
ted the district $45.55, which goes to
purchase an organ.

UNCLE BOB"
MAKES A HIT
Big Dance and Children's Party wcrt
Great Successes. 400 Children
Present
The big dance given by one of oui
townsmen, Mr. Robert Isaacs, on Sat
urday evening last, was a crowning
success, as is most every thing that
this veteran undertakes. The event
was staged in honor of the opening
of Mr. Isaacs new mammoth imple
ment and ware house, which he has
just completed, and is one of the per
manent new structures of the city.
There was a great crowd in town
on Monday, Big Monday, and many of
them came or at least Btayed around '
until late in the day to be present at
the big affair. John Hill was master
of ceremonies and at about nine o'clock
the music being furnished by Bristol's
Orchestra, the grand March was on
and "Your Uncle Bob" and wife led
off with as much "pep" as though they
had been twenty years younger. The
March terminated in a dance at which
juncture "Bob" and wife dropped, not
for any fault of Bobs, but the musie
kept crossing his feet until he saw
P hat it would be better to drop out than
to do something that he would be
sorry of.
si In all, it was a grand success. The
skating party that was promised to
the children on Wednesday was no less
attended, in fact Bob was compelled
to double his order on candy for they
were there, the "children" about four
hundred strong, and to say that "Your
Uncle Bob" enjoyed every minute of
were furnished by Mr. Isaacs to ac
commodate all and a great time was
had. ' s
