Letters to Citizens
Williston, N. D., March 10, 1916.
Dear Sir:
The directors of the Commercial
Club are now preparing a tentative
program for the year's work. In or
der to secure the ideas of all and
thereby start out right with a sound,
practical plan that will have unit
support, this letter is sent you with
the request that you cooperate with
the club by promptly answering and
returning the questions asked and
making any and all suggestions that
you believe will help. While the
board prefers you sign your name to
your answers, it is not necessary if
for any reason you should rather not.
It is the purpose of the directors to
make the Commercial Club what it
should be and what it must be in or
der to merit the support of all our
people. We are confident you will
welcome an opportunity to girt your
own ideas and help the club get start
ed right. In order to know what the
public in general thinks the dab
should undertake and just how to do
it, we must have an expression from
each individual, setting forth his per
sonal opinion. We have decided upon
this letter plan rather than holding
a public meeting because we know
there are those who have splendid
ideas but who are not accustomed to
talking and expressing themselves in
public. Make your answers, com
ments or suggestions just as broad as
you wish and if this is the first real
opportunity you have ever had to ex
press your opinion as to what the
Commercial Club of your city should
do, now is the time to make up for it.
In doing this the directors want you
to understand clearly that you are
not bound in any manner whatsoever
to join the 'club or to pay any dues,
donations or budget assessments. All
that is wanted now is your personal

Pioneer Railroader
Severely Injured
Wm. T. Benton, 427 First Avenue
east, one of the oldest local men, in
point of service, employed by the
Great Northern, met with an accident
last Thursday that may prove fatal,
although late reports hold out some
encouragement.
In the capacity of train master Mr.
Benton was on the Berthold branch
near Niobe where a snow plow was
clearing up the lines. The full cir
cumstances of the accident cannot be
known as it is said there were no eye
witnesses before it occured but
through some misunderstanding Mr.
Benton was overtaken on a high
tressle bridge by an engine with a
wedge plow ahead. The width of the
plow left him no chance but to iumn
or be struck. The accident occured
late in the evening and the engineer
saw the flash of the trapped man's
lantern as he fell to the ice 25 feet
below.
He ws'i hastened to a Minot hos
pital where the company saw thut
everything possible was done, even to
bringing a specialist from St. Paul.
According to reports he did not re
gain consciousness until Tuesday af
ternoon and then for only a short
time. Mrs. Benton, accompanied by
Mrs. E. W. Blaisdell went to Minot
by first train. Reports received
through trainmen yesterday were to
the effect that the injured man show
ed some signs of improvement. About
a year ago Mr. Benton met with a
severe injury to his foot.
Williston
The Hardy Kiosk
Lives On Climate
And Is Costless
They were discussing new attrac
tions for the city at a meeting of com
mercial club directors. "Did you ever
see a kiosk," asked President Jack
son, "They are the cutest things out
and I understand the government is
furnishing them to some cities, free
of cost"?
"Is that right"? spoke up Cunning
ham, with much interest, "I saw sev
eral specimens of the cayuse, in Ore
gon, and have seen many North Da
kota coyotes, but do not recall ever
seeing a kiosk—still I may have, in
a menagerie."
"I would not recognize one if I saw
it in the Williston Drug store/' said
Charlie Mansfield, "but if there is any
chance of getting them free, I move
that the secretary write the proper
department requesting that two be
sent to Williston, a male and a female.
We can put them on the island, south
of the depot for the edification of pass
ing tourists."
"I suppose they originally came
from northern Siberia and so would
stand the winters all right and would
probably keep fat on alfalfa," added
G. B. Metzger.
"Order, gentlemen, I have the floor.
You fellows will have me thinking I
am back at Jamestown," this from
the president. "I was going to ex
plain to you that a kiosk long i, ac
cent about equally divided) is a
small, ornamental, concern that
houses every sort of weather instru
ment known to science. They are sta
tioned at convenient public places and
the elements and the weather are test
ed, measured, weighed, sampled and
dissected the weather's pulse is felt
and its mind read concerning it's in
tentions for the next 24 hours. The
results are plainly recorded in simple
words of two cylinders so that the
curious public may read and heed.
"In short," explained Mr. Jackson, "a
kiosk is a sort of minature and auto
matic, combind weather bureau and
bulletin—a ready compendium of use
ful information for busy people. If
the department should set up a lib
erally educated and highly pedigreed
kiosk at the Great Northern station
Hiram Eastman of Jonesburg, 111.,
could step off No. 1 for a couple of
minutes, introduce himself to the
kiosk—learn the name of the city,
distance from other points, popula
tion, altitude, principal industries,
temperature at the moment and for
past night, name of the commercial
club secretary, velocity of the wind,
average price of farm land, if the
previous day was cloudy or fair, per
cent of humidity in the air, total bank
deposits and post office receipts, if
rain or shine would prevail for the
next 24 hours, tons of lignite coal
mined the previous year, which way
is north, just how much Williston is
going1 to beat the other team next
Saturday, at what figure September
wheat closed and why Williston is the
best town along the line."
TO ORGANIZE ROYAL
NEIGHBORS
Lila L. West of Hurdsfield, N. D.,
deputy organizer for a district cover
ing about half the state, is in the city
for the purpose of organizing a lodge
of Royal Neighbors which is the
womens' auxiliary to the Modem
Woodmen of America. The Royal
Neighbors is the largest auxiliary or
der in the world which is a fact suffi
cient in itself to entitle it to great
consideration. Miss West points out
that the order has not only quantity
but quality, its membership coming
from the wives, mothers and daugh
ters of Woodmen. No difficulty is
anticipated in forming a large and
active order of Neighbors. An an
nouncement to Woodmen will be found
in another column.
A LEAP YEAR BOY
Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Swedlund are
the happy parents of a fine son who
according to popular traditions is des
tined for some unique experiences. If
checked up by his birthdays he will
not "be of age" until this time in the
year 2,000 A. D., at which time he
certainly will be. He will have to
wait until the presidential primaries
of the same year before he can vote
for either Bryan or Teddy. If he does
not wait about 80 years before speak
ing to "her father" he will be turned
down as too youthful—that is if the
old man is feeling grouchy and look
ing for an excuse. He can't run for
president until, by actual count, he is
140 and then he will know better. This
boy was born on the 29th of February.
VOL. XXI, NO. 88 WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1916.
NEWTON D. BAKER
SECRETARY OF WAR
PRESIDENT SELECTS CLEVE
LAND MAN TO SUCCEED GAR
RISON—HAS GOOD RECORD
Gap In Cabinet Will Be Filled By
Reform Mayor—Has Had Cab
inet Experience
Washington, March 6.—Newton D.
Baker, former mayor of Cleveland, O.,
has been selected by President Wilson
for secretary of war. Baker has ac
cepted the position, and is now ar
ranging his affairs in Cleveland prep
aratory to coming to Washington to
take up his duties.
The selection of Baker is under
stood to have been discussed by Presi
dent Wilson with Colonel House soon
after the latter's arrival here.
Offered a Portfolio Before
When the president was making his
cabinet in 1913, he offered the place
of secretary of the interior to Baker,
twice. Baker, then mayor of Cleve
land, declined for that reason. The
president and Baker have been friends
for some time, and have corresponded
frequently. When the president was
touring the middle west on his pre
paredness program, he saw Baker in
Cleveland and had a long talk with
him.
Ever since Lindley Garrison resign
ed, the president has been seeking a
middle western lawyer for the place.
The 30-day period for which Major
General Hugh Scott, chief of staff,
designated secretary of war ad
interim, will expire March 11. It is
believed Baker's nomination will be
sent to the senate before that time.
Secretary to Cabinet Member
Baker is 44 years old and was born
in Martinsburg, W. V. At the age of
35, he was private secretary to Post
master General Wilson in President
Cleveland's cabinet. In 1897, he be
gan the practice of law at Martins
burg, but was not long there. After
wards he moved to Cleveland, where
he became city solicitor in 1902. He
held this office for ten years until his
election as mayor. Baker has receiv
ed the degrees at John Hopkins and
Washington and Lee universities.
A Reform Mayor
For years he has been closely iden
tified with the reform movement in
Cleveland. When Mayor Tom John
son died, Baker took up the fight for
lower street car fares in Cleveland.
The Williston To
Crosby Road Plans
The farmers of the northern part of
the county are making renewed ef
forts to interest capital in the Wil
liston-Crosby railroad. Leaders in
the movement having gotten in touch
with a man named Henderson who has
successfully promoted several lines
in the Dakotas and Minnesota, in
duced him to come here and look the
local proposition over. Mr. Hender
son arrived the latter part of last
week and was met by Harry Porter
and taken over the route by Mr. Por
ter, Mr. Borstad and others. It is
understood that a new route is being
considered via Zahl, Bonetraill and
Squires, entering Williston from the
west through Sand Creek valley.
Meetings were held and it is under
stood that a tentative proposition was
made the farmers but just what it
was has not been learned. There is
great need of transportation for the
inland districts of the two counties
and it is to be hoped that through one
means or another it will be realized
at a nearly date. Anything within her
power to do will be done by Williston
to further the enterprize because it is
to her advantage. The talk so in
dustriously circulated to the effect
that this town is opposed to a railroa
to the northwest country is un*
and unfair and based on nothing
misinformation or prejudice.

BRILLIANT BANQUET
WILLISTON COUNCIL, K. OF C.
ADD 35 TO THEIR NUMBER
MANY VITITORS PRESENT
Event Celebrated By Splendid Ban
quet at Library Hall Sunday Even
ing—Fine Program
Sunday was the most important day
in the history of Williston Council,
No. 1798, Knights of Columbus. Many
members of the Knights and the
clergy were gathered with the local
council to solemnize and celebrate the
initation of a class of thirty-five can
didates. The impressive ceremonies
began with high mass at St. Josephs
church, continued in Odd Fellows hall
and concluded with a splendid ban
quet at the library in the evening.
High mass was attended in a body
by the candidates and members, mass
being read by Father Nicholas Rau
of Popular, Mont., and the sermon
preached by Father O'Neil of Willis
ton.
Brown's mass in E flat was render
ed by the choir assisted by John A.
Corbett and H. R. Evans and directed
by Prof. A. Onstad
In the initiations, the exemplifica
tion of the first and second degree
work was by the officers of the Wil
liston Council and the third degree
was by members of the Dickinson
Council, headed by State Deputy J.
P. Cain. The management of the af
fairs of the day was participated in
by Thos B. Murphy, district deputy
and warden of the State Council.
The sumptuous banquet, at which
150 were seated, was prepared and
served by the ladies of the Altar So
ciety. A most interesting program
of speaking followed the repast with
W. J. Kelly, a local knight, in the role
of toast master. The speakers who
responded were: Grand Knight N. B.
Ludowese of this city, J. H. McGarry
of Alexander, Rev. Fther O'Neil of
^ji'iston, Rev.. Father Van Gils of
Ray, E. J. Hughes of Dickinson, Mr.
LaFleur of Minot, Dr. Nockway of
Dickinson, and State Deputy J. P.
Cain.
The affairs of the day passed off
with gratifying smoothness, out of
town knights pronouncing it the most
successful exemplification of the first
three degrees of the work they had
ever witnessed in the Northwest.
Finest In the City
Call And Be Shown
Permanently and conveniently es

that he has the finest offices in the
city. Any Missourian who doubts
this claim will please step up to the
second floor some day, when in the
building, and see for himself, or her
self.
The department has been renting
quarters for the local station since it
was moved from Buford to Williston
in 1893 and in that time hs'.s paid
about $8,000. for rent. In a wern

penurious but felt that furnishing'

Gold Discovered
In Williston,
North Dakota
Looks like a phoney head line, don't
it? Well, it isn't. It, the gold, is
the real thing and was not discovered
by Doc Cook but by the Graphic re
porter, in the course of his preambu
lations through the ramifications of
our city of opportunity. Just be
patient, Pauline, and you shall learn
where. You have noticed the big wide
sand bar, the river formed the past
summer, at the west end of the island,
just oposite the city—well, that wasn't
the place—never was on that sand
bar. In a woolen sock, tucked under
the eaves of an old log shack on First
street—that might have been the
place—but it was not. Let's try
again. In the north side of the cop
per covered, coal bin shaped structure,
at the head of the spiral stair, leading
from the weather office to roof of the
post office building whereon are the
recording instruments, is a door. On
that door there is a lock—in commer
cial terms, a rim lock, attached to the
outside surface of the door. On the
same door is a pair of hinges—other
wise known as butts.
Said lock and said hinges are GOLD
PLATED and cost $22. Now what
do you think of that for democratic
extravagance? Local partisans claim
the set was left over from the days
of Williams Howard Taft. Be that
I as it may, the department knew just.
what it was doing when it sent those
gold trimmings to Williams county.
The fourteenth assistant secretary of
the department of agriculture (of
which department the weather bureau
is a branch) had heax-d of the Golden
West with it's golden opportunities,it's
golden grain and it's golden sunshine
—in short he had gathered a bit of
local color and sought to match it.
Like North Dakota weather, our
weather bureau handle is "bright and
fair."
All citizens who will submit in ad
vance to being searched for files,
screw drivers, cold chisels and jack
knives, will be allowed to climb the
winding stair and turn- the golden
knob—once. No objection to acid
tests, or snap shots with kodaks.

Judge Frank E. Fisk, a roynd dozen

gathered around the banquet board at
The Silver Grill last Saturday night
as a mark of esteem and a hearty
God speed to Mr. Spencer who depart

Cali., to make his home.
After the party had done justice to
the appetizing menu, Toast Master
H. W. Braatelien put the after din
ner speakers through their paces
with a succession witty sallies aimed
at the profession. A question of
doubt was raised as to the origin or
meaning of the ancient term, at on*
time applied to certain members of
the bar, "proctor in admiralty." Mr
Braatelien said the answer was easy,,
that then, as' now, some barristers
when they came before the eourt
were at sea—hence the term. In in
troducing Ivan Metzger, the youngster
of the local bar, the toast master
solemnly declare: "Out of the mouths
of babes we shall learn wisdom.''
