IT IS
Haphazard
of trying to conserve one's income that cause
so many people to become confused, to lose out
and finally to stop all efforts to accumulate .
The man WINS who knows exactly what he is
trying to do, has a definite plan and makes u se
of a systematic and continuous effort to ac
complish his purpose.
Our Bank Account Plan is especially suited to
the needs of this man. No red tape. He can

WE ARE A KEKBER OP THE
Money.
It is possible to insure almost anything against de
struction from almost any source. But there is one thing
that cant be insured money.
The only way to secure yourself against loss of money
is to put it where it will be secure. That place is a good,
reliable bank, like ours. Here it will be safe and secure
from theft, fire and waste; yet it is where you can get it
quickly and conveniently. All you need to carry is a
bunch of blank checks keys to your deposit in the bank,
but of no value to anyone but yourself. Isn't that the
best insurance?
OURS IS THE ONLY DANK IN DAXTER
SPRINGS IN WHICH DEPOSITS ARE
GUARANTEED.
