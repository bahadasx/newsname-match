added very pleasant social fea- i

Chaplin's Enormous Salary. 1
Unless there is a misprint in 1
the figures, the mathematical 1
movie editor of the Atlinta
Journal has figured it out that
Charles Chaplin, the comedian,
iraws 78 cents every time he '
Jmu's hie hrooiVi i,ntin ? ?... 1
~ vivuui, uiiuci ma new
?670,000 anuual contract with 1
die Mutual Film corporation.
Chaplin signed up at this 1
stupendous salary after dicker- 1
ing for months with many 1
noving picture companies. His I
:ontract with Essanay has just
jnded. They paid him more .
,han the president of the United ,
states receives, but he held out |
?or still more. When they
wouldn't come across, Chaplin
;hrew himself upon the open (
narket, with the result that the 1
Vlutual company took him at his '
>wn price. (
Mathematically figured, Chapin's
salnrv is- (
78 cents a second, or j
$4.48 a minute, or
$268.(X> an hour, or
$2,147.00 a day. or
$22,884.00 a week, or
