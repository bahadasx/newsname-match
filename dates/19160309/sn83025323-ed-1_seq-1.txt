IRRIGATION DURING 1916
MILK RIVER PROJEUT
During the irrigation season of
1916 the U. S. Reclamation Service,
will be prepared to give irrigations
water service to water users under
the Dodson North Canal, between
Dodson dam and the end of the cAn
al in the vicinity of Malta, and tin
der the Dodson South Canal, bey:
tween Dodson dam and Lake Bow
doin, commencing on April 25. Un
der the Vandalia South Canal, ex
tending from Vandalia past Tampi
co, Paisley and Glasgow, to the een'
of the canal system, it s probable
that it will be impracticable to make'
deliveries before May 1, or possibly
May 15, this due to the fact that'
work at Vandalia diversion consist
ing of installation of the moveable
crest and operating bridge, will be
in progress until that date. This
work consists of huge steel gates
and automatic lifting devices, which
are designed to raise the water level
above the dam an additional six
feet. Upon the istallation of these
gates and lifting devices the Van
dalia dam will be completed in its
entirety.
The form of application for water
service is new, but in its general
terms it is similar to the form used
heretofore, with the following im
portant change: The advance pay
ment of 50 per cent for water ser
vice will not be required, but the
entire charge of $1.00 per acre-foot
shall become due on March 1, 1917,
and shall be subject to the discount
and penalties provided in Section 6
of the Reclamation Extension Act,
which is as follows:
"Sec. 6.-That all operation and
maintenance charges shall become
due and payable in the date fixed
for each project by the Secretary
of the Interior and if such charge
is paid on or before the date when
due there shall be a discount of 5
per centum of such charge; but if
such charge is unpaid on or before
the first day of the third calendar
month thereafter, a penalty of one
per centum of the amount unpaid
shall be added on the first day of
each calendar month if such charges
and penalties shall remain unpaid,
and no water shall' be delivered to
the lands of any water-right appli
cant or entryman who shall be in
arrears for more than one calendar
year for the payment of any charge
for operation and maintenance, or
any annual construction charge and
penalties. If any water-right appli
cant or entryman shall beone year
in arrears in the payment of any
charge for operation and mainten
ance and penalties, or an" part
thereof, his water-right application,
and if he be a homestead entryman
his entry also, shall be subject to
cancellation, and all payments made
by him forfeited to the reclamation
fund, but no homestead entry shall
be subject to contest because of such
arrears. In the discretion of the
Secretary of the Interior suit or ac
tion may be brought for the
amounts in default and penalties in
like manenr as provided in section
three of this act."
In general, application for 'about
one-acre-foot of water should be
made for each acre which it is pro
posed to irrigate. but in making
this application it should be rem
embered that charge will be made
for irrigation water service for
each acre-foot. applied for, whether
used or not, provided water is avail
able for delivery. In additiona, a
charge of 25 cents will be made for
the preparation by an official of the
Reclamation Service, but no charge
will be made for information con
cerning the name of the canal from
which water is to be delivered and
other general information necessary
for the preparation of the applica
tion. The following is the new form
of water service application:

Why Do You Make Your Own House
Ci Dresses?
"You cannot make them as cheaply as you ean buy them, because
you and I cannot compete with the modern factory.
"They cut 20 dresses at one time-they sew on 5,000 buttons a day
with one machine-they work corded buttonholes that cannot rip,
also by machine.
'"You cannot sew a seam as evenly as the new machines that can
make sixteen stitches to the inch-you cannot buy as good or as com
fortable a pattern as Ibis dress was cut over.
"If you count your time for anything, you cannot make a dress for
twice what I paid for this one."
Mina Taylor Dresses
are so stylish in appearance-so low in price-so sturdy in service
that no woman who values her time will try to make a house dress
when she can buy one that is better at a lower price.
We sell Mina Taylor Dresses at $1.25 and up
Come in and we will convince you that you. cannot afford to try t:
make your own dress.
