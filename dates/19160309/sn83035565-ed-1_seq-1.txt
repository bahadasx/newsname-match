Dangers ol Draft.
Drafts ftel better when we are
hot and perspiring, just when
they are most dangerous and the
result is Neuralgia, Stiff Neck,
Sore Muscles or sometimes an at
tack of Rheumatism. In such
cases apply Sloan's Liniment. It
stimulates circulation to the sore
and painful part. The blood flows
freely and in a short time the
stiffness and pain leaves. Those
suffering from Neuralgic Head
ache will find one or two applica
tions of Sloan's Liniment will
give grateful relief. The ago
nizing pain gives way to a ting
ling sensation of comfort and
warmth and quiet rest and sleep
is possible. Good for Neuritis
too. Price 25c at your druggist.
Adv
To Prevent Lead Poisoning.
Many painters do not realize the
danger of lead poisoning from white,
black and red load paints. Outside of
cuts the most accessible place for the
lead to enter Is the flesh around the
finger nails, its entrance there can be
preventad by dipping the finger tips
Into warm paraffin or beeswax, where
upon gloves are put on mid nne pro
ceeds with the work. The paraffin can
he easily removed when the work Is
completed or at the end of the day.
Coal in France at $10 a ton above
the average here also helps to make
us feel thankful.
If every revolution must have Its an
niversary holiday when will the Mex
icans work!
Cottage Plan For Public School.
Colorado Springs Is trying with suc
cess the "cottage plan" for public
schools. With a separate building for
each class the disturbances are elimi
nated of classes passing through rooms
or halls to and from recltatious. and
the risks of Ore. panic and epidemic
disease are reduced to a minimum.
