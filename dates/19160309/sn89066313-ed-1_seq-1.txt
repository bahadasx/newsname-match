BUSINESS IS BASED
ONRELIGIQN.HESAYS
Dr. Hugh Black Tells Com
mercial Club "Hope" Is
Financial "Confidence."
PANICS AS. EXAMPLE
Believes Most Modern Prob
lems Due to Wrong In
dividual Relations.
Nearly ever) problem of the busi
ness world todaj springs fundamen
tal from a religious source, the
Rev. Hugh Black told the Columbia
Commercial Club at its luncheon 'at
the Virginia Tea Room today. His
subject was the relation of religion
and commerce.
"Religion," said Doctor Black,
"viewed in its true sense, not as a
promenade on Sunday, nut as a dy
namic force in the lives of individuals,
is tied up ver) closely with the com
mercial world. Some business men
have a habit of sa)ing they will have
nothing to do with religion because
it is not based on an established busi
ness principle. One business man
gave me such an explanation for his
disregard of religion. It was the time
of the 1907 panic. I didn't answer his
statement, but asked him what was
the cause of that great Rich Man's
panic.
" 'Oh, the business men began to
lose confidence in the banks. Credit
could not be secured,' he said.
"'It seems to me that what jou
business men call confidence and
credit,' I told him, 'is jolly near what
I call "hope" in my religion.'
"Religion does not consist in when,
why and where the world was begun
or will end. Religion is in itself a
principle on which men live. Man is
essentially religious incurably re
ligious. The qualifications which
make a business man what he is, are
fundamental!) religious, as for exam
ple character, or honesty in dealing.
".Nearly even problem of today
reaches back to a source religious.
Problems are found wherever the hu
man relations are wrong. Religion
is the science of the relations of indi
viduals.
"This Commercial Club is doing
good because it is getting the business
men into their right relations."
Doctor Rlack wished prosperity for
Columbia and the Commercial Club.
"There is a danger in a town striv
ing for numbers in its enthusiasm,"
he said in conclusion. "I would rather
live in a town like this which has the
proper relations between its individ
uals than to live in the biggest booin
city in the United States."

Or. Hugh Illiuk S.ijs "He Mas a -Man
of Originalit)."
"We find that Jesus was a man of
artistry and originality," said Dr.
Hugh Rlack in his talk at the Univer
sity Auditorium last night. He was
discussing Jesus' parables as a means
of ascertaining the personality of
Jesus.
"He was revolutionary," continued
Doctor Rlack, "and he bewildered the
people about him by recogni7ing cer
tain sources of law, but at all times
holding paramount his own conscious
ness that he was taught of God. His
mission was to teacli and save others
by showing them the pitfalls of his
own experience."
PREP UtED.N ESS M)T HIS AFFAIR
Dr. Hugh Rlack Sajs He Has .No
Right In (lire Opinion.
The Rev. Hugh Rlack, who is giving
a series of lectures at the Universit)
Auditorium this week, believes that
preparedness is aiono of his affair.
"I am Scotch," lie saiil, "and 1
think that the time lias not come when
I have a right to give my opinion on
American national questions. I.eave
that to the American politicians."
Doctor Rlack bilieves that there Is
more religion among college profes
sors ajid students than ever before.

thing," is Ills comment upon thjs con

DO.VI' WASTE WATElt, HE VK.N
One of y. V. Pumps Is Out of Order,
Sajs A. L. Weslcntt.
"Don't waste the water," is the re
quest of A. L. Westcott, superinten
dent of University buildings, to all
persons using water from the Uni
versity wells. The machinery which
pumps water from one of the deep
wells has been out of order since Feb
ruary 20. The University has had
to draw from the city suplv after i
o'clock at night, and Columbia's sup
ply has not been so low for several
)ears, according to Mr. Westcott. He
warns students who live in Univer
sity dormitories and those who use
water in the laboratories not to waste
water lest persons over the city may
have to suffer.
Tho material for repairing the
pump has been ordered from Roches
ter, X. Y., hut owing to the scarcity
of metal used in making machine
parts it did not arrive in St. Louis,
where the pump was sent for repairs,
until a few da)s ago. Mr. Westcott
thinks the jinmp will be ready by the
first of next week.
