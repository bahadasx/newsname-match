U. S. TROOPS IN CONTROL.
El Paso, Tex., March 9.—An official report from Colonel Slocum of
teenth cavalry, commanding the troops at Columbus, to his commnading
Douglas, Ariz., follows:
"The camp was attacked at 4:30 o'clock this morning by a force of from 800 to
1,000 Mexicans, with a machine gun platoon, from across the border. The attack was
repulsed and at 6:45 a. m. the Mexicans retreated towards the border to the southeast.
I have sent mounted troops in pursuit. Several buildings were burned in the town.
So far as known the army loss has been three men killed and four wounded. A num
ber of civilians were killed in the town. A number of dead Mexican soldiers are lying
around the town and camp. All firing has ceased. No help necessary."
Columbus, N. M., March 9.—Five hundred Villa bandits attacked this point at
4:30 o'clock this morning, killing a number of civilians, both men and women, and held
possession of the tQiyn for an hour and a half.
They were driven off by three troops .of the Thir$d»ntli cavalry. The bandits re
treated at 6 o'clock, leaving part pf1^ j^wxi in tfames!
A large number of Mexicans were killed. Their bodies dotted the street where
they had been posted picking off Americans as they emerged pell mell out of dwellings
and hotels. There appeared to be no wounded. Several guests were burned to death
in the Central hotel, which was one of the first buildings fired by Villa's men.
The Mexican bandits standing outside the flaming building shot down A. L. Rit
chie, proprietor of the hotel, and W. R. Walker, a guest, as they attempted a dash out
of the door. Both were dead when picked up. C. C. Miller, a drug store owner, was
shot as he tried to enter the door of the Hoover hotel, an adobe structure, whose mud
walls protected a score of cowering women and children who remained in their rooms
while a howling mob of bandits surged through the surrounding streets.
Although they first attacked the camp of the Thirteenth cavalry it suffered little,
although a number of American soldiers were killed and wounded, and a number of
cavalry horses were ridden off by the Mexicans as they fled back toward Mexico after
daybreak.
a complete surprise, Villa deceiving all authorities by sending a
telegram to Hachka, N. M., last night saying that he was at the Nogales ranch in Chi
huahua, near the border, at least 44 miles from here. This telegram which was signed
ostensibly by the American caretaker of the ranch, stated that Villa personally was at
the ranch house.
All the while, however, Villa was making his way from the Bosques Grandes
ranch, about 25 miles southwest of here. A Mexican scoilt gave intimation of this. He
reported late last night that he saw two parties of Villa's men movnig eastward from the
Bosques Grandes ranch toward Palomas, the abandoned Carranza outpost six miles di
rectly south of here.
Colonel H. J. Slocum, commanding the Thirteenth cavalry, had a heavy patrol,
consisting of two troops of cavalry at Gibsons' ranch, 15 miles west. The Carranza
customs guards at the border gates three.miles south of Columbus, had dug a few rifle
pits for 50 Carranza
frame buildings which were set on
fire, and shot at the American in
mates as they sotight refuge from the
fast destroying flames., Several bulld
ingB were destroyed in this way. These
Mexicans moved deliberately in the
darkness. Lighting of lamps byhouse
holders and hotel guests startled out
of sound sleep by the rifle fusillade,
promptly brought a shower of bullets.
Every house in town and every win
dow appeared to have been hit froht
once to a dozen times.
Civilian* Resist.
Civilians armed themselves Did
from various vantage polpts within
their homes answered the shots of the
Mexicans.
Some bandits sought to entice
Americans out into the streets by
speaking English. J. S. Dean was
caught in this way. A Mexican, who
spoke excellent English, called to him.
As Dean emerged from the doorway,
his reply in English betrayed him to
be an American and brought his
death Instantly.

troops of the Thirteenth cavalry is

The American pointed to a street
intersection where half a dozen dead
bandit-raiders lay in the pale light of
the dawn. The quick, flashes of a few
pistol shots visible'disclosed the dying
forms in the street, but Villa was not
among them. Villa apparently left
when Colonel Slocum's troops began
pressing the snipers towards the south.

Villa's buglers began sounding the
retreat shortly before I o'clock. The
town was cleared of them by 6:30 and

Washington, March 9.—
Secretary Lansing announc
ed that the United States had
considered asking General
Carranza for permission to
send American troops into
Mexico to capture the Villa
bandits who raided Colum
bus.
Secretary Lansing said
that if permission is asked it
would be for this occasion
only and that the troops
would be withdrawn when
they had accomplished their
purpose.
It was said the request for
permission to send American
troops into Mexico probably
would go forward to General
Carranza before night.

MEMORANDUM DRAFTED.
Washington, March 9.—The

The memorandum is being pre
pa ...... view to its dispatch
in case Secretary Iiansing decides
to present the case to Carranza.
Washington, March 9.—The first re
ports of the Mexican raid on Colum
bus were received at the White House
While President Wilson was having his
first conference with Newton D. Bak
er, the new secretary of war. The
raid started new agitation in congress
where* those who have been opposed
to the administrations Mexican policy
openly charged that the attack was
proof of their repeated declarations
that the Carranza government was
impotent., to deal with the situation,
and a fulfillment of their predictions,
that another outrage like the recent
massacre, in w.hich sixteen Americans
were killed by Villa bandits when'
they held up a train, was only a ques
tion of time.'
There were indications that the
Columbus massacre undoubtedly
would be the signal for another out
break in the senate where the op
ponents of the administrations policy
are most active.
At the White House, after the presi
dent and Secretary of War Baker had
discussed the reports briefly, the
president decided that the new war
secretary should take office immedi
ately. He signed Secretary Baker's
commission and the new secretary
went to his office where, he was sworn
in. One of the probable courses
most discussed is to send American
troops over the line to clean out the
bandits.
It is said at the White House that

QUEEN LIL'S DEED
IS DECLARED VALID
Honolulu. T. H., March 9.—The su
preme court of Hawaii held that
Liliuokalani, former queen of Hawaii,
was mentally competent when, sev
eral years ago, she executed a deed
of trust conveying all her property to
three trustees, headed by the late
Samuel Cleghorn, father of Princess
Kaiulani, also deceased.
The decision was rendered in a suit
brought by her nephew, Jonah Kuliio
Kalanianaole, better known as Prince
Cupid, delegate to congress from
Hawaii, to have the trust deed dis
solved on the ground that the former
queen was mentally unsound when she
executed it.
Cupid brought suit as Liloukalani's
"next best friend." The court denied
his right to bring the suit and decided
that the former queen was presuma
bly sane and competent.
The deed of trust gave the trustees
absolute and irrevocable control over
the former queen's extensive estate.
