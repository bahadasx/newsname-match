NESS MEN WANT
A grain elevator iiuin from Kansas
is expected here this month, and a
number of the local business men are
planning to show him that they want
an elevator in Tuciimcari, and that the
farmers in the country arc very much
interested in the matter. The exact
date of his arrival is not Known at
thin time, hut an automobile trip over
the surrounding district is being ar
ranged for, so that the opportunities
and possibilities may lie shown to
the best advantage.
Some six to ten automobiles have
been offered for use and a strong elclo
gation of boosters is being organized
to vlult Hnirlimil .Ini-itmi. k'ii-L- Mr
Alistcr, House, Murdock, Forrest. !
Plains, Puerto, Norton, and other lo-
cnlitien in the agricultural district.
It is believed that an elevator here
can do well, that it will lie a benefit to
the farmers, and that it will be an
asset to thu entire county. It is pre
dicted that it will promulgate to a
great extent the planting nnd produc
tion of larger grain crops.
Letters have been addressed to many
of the farmers requesting their as
sistance in pulling for the proposi
tion, and considerable interest gener
ally is being manifested in the matter.
Co-opcrntion is necessary to accom
plish anything so the citizens of Quay
county should do all in their power to
encourage the establishment of an ele
vator in Tucumcari or some other rail
road town.
CONDITIONS IN THE EAST
We have all been rending of the
great industrial activity in manufac
turing centers and of the making of
millionaires b y the wholesale on ac
count of now conditions. From what
1 have observed and been told the
printed reports have not been exag
gerated. New York is drunk with
business, nnd the "groat white way"
is crazy. From early evening on
through the wee small hours of morn,
ing, Uroadway, from 34th street to
89th is a boiling, seething mass of
humanity too varied to describe. To
a jay from the hoar grass, it was too
strenuous and after venturing a few
blocks in it and among it ho was glad
to bent it for shelter. It is a good nn
tured crowd, a well dressed crowd,
but all intent upon spend. All the big
thenters are in thnt section, nnd they
releaso their crowds about 11 p. m.
Thnt is the c.me the real life begins.
"Going to the play" is a mero incident.
And automobiles! I must have dodged
10,000 of them at the street cross
ings nnd seen a million. Of course?,
I didn't count 'em -couldn't, they go
too fast.
Hut Hint's enough about Broadway.
What I want most to tell about is the
merchandise situation. To be frank,
it is serious. Not that we are going
to hnve to reert back to "lig leaves"
-there will be sufficient supply to
clothe our nakedness, hut we'll have
to dig deeper in mir pockets than ever
before to pay for it. and we can't tm
so discriminating when it comes to
the quality and pattern of the cloth.
In all my experience I have never
found stock so low with wholesaler-.
and they say the mills will not guar
antee anything for the future. Con
tracts entered into a year ago have
not been touched by the mills and
jobbers are taking what they can get
as they can get it. Particularly is
this true of staple piece goods such
as ginghams, percales, muslins, etc.
The price is of secondary considcrn
tion--getting the goods if tlu- main
thing.
And speaking of prices -iheie have
already been radical advances on ev
erything and the future promircs even
grenter. The price on an article to
day is as far as anyone will go; to
morrow will have to look out f-r it
self. The lines I found that had shown
great advances, with more to follow,
were those into the manufacture of
w'.lch enter cotton, wool, silk, iron,
steel, brass, copper, glass, clay and
dye stuffs. Outside of these I can't
say as thoy are not among my lines,
And why this situation' There
are several "whys." Ab for cotton
goods, for several seasons the mills
had bean curtailing their output In
order to disposo of surplus stocks on
hand to onnblo them to keep in touch
with tho raw matorinl market. After
that time their out-put was all made
under contract with the distributors
in othor words, their goods wore
sold boforo they wero made nnd the
jobbers contracted for only what thoy
thought thoy could dispose of in n
senson.
On account of tho European war
America was suddenly cnlled upon to
supply demands from numbers of neu
tral nntlons thnt formerly depended
unon Europe. In addition to that, bcl
ligcrents hnvo been drawing on us
moro heavily for both tho raw ma
terial and tho finished product. De
mands for homo consumption hnvo
been heavier than ovor before known,
Tho result is tho millB hnvo such tre
mendous outlet for their products that

COUNTY AGENT HERE
Roland Harwell, county agent of
I Torrance count., was acre last week
vi iling Supl. Herbert .Smith of the
Government Station, looking through
the toeoiels and gatheiing data with
which to advertise New .Mexico.
Torrance county has had a county
HRenl but a very brief time. Recently
some of the residents of the county
took a notion to dispell, e with thu ser
vices of an agent, claiming It was
canting the taxpayers too much money
to carry on tin work. Vigorous pro
u...ts went up from all parts of the
county and the hoard of commission
( is decided to retain the ugent. It
was proved that the railioads pay
nearly 00 per cent of the taxes of the
county. The average Torrance county
Iua payer contributes approximately
10 cents a year for the support of tho
agultl.
All opposition to a county agent,
leenuso of the expense . has now dis
appeared and Roland Harwell, of the
l.tiitod States depnrtm ;nt of agricul
i'lce, is vigorously going ahead with
ilie work. There was ait one silo In
Ik- county when Mr. Harwell started
..ork. There are ten stlos now, either
f uilt or in course of construction. Tho
li.rmers are beginning to see that the
ilo will put Torrance coun'y on the
map. Mr. Harwell has arranged to
it cement for -ilo construction from
iibiic-.-pirite-d merchants at cost. The
machinery for the silo is nl:o securcl
at reduced prices and a boost for tl.e
immunity. The average silo builder
: urn-mi Shll thi-mii'li the ciitmlv nircnt.
jxhnt the silo idea has taken hold with
.he fanners is indicated by the fact
that fifteen rilo are to be built in
i arious parts of the county within the
j ne-xt few months, this being in addi
i tion to the ten now built or being con
tracted. I Air. Harwell is having good success
; with organization work among boys'
, ind girls' clubs. During the last week
o visited ten schools in tho countv,
n each of which gren. interest was
hown by the pupils in the plans fori,.,,,.!.
county development through the ju-, j 0 not consider this a political
enilo- matter. In fact, 1 am so little inter-

one of the leading agi -cultural coun- cndidatos that I elo not know wheth
ties in the state and lv all mean it r other memliers, who have announced
hould fall in line and take up this 0 lnH ticket, are Denocrats or Itc

CAPTURES ALTO THIEF
Last Fmby Iienir Ward captured
a young man from Amarillo who hnd
stolen an Overland car and driven it
to thi- city.
The young man ilenied that he had
stolen the car but said lie knew who
elid stent it. lie mid the thieves told
him where they left it anil hired him
to come nfter it and return the ma
chine to Amarrillo. After asking tho
young fellow so many questions It
made hi. heart come! mi in his throat
the young man finally called the sher
iff to a '-relet place and confeed to
stealing the car. The authorities at
Amarillo were notilied and they sent
Deputy Sherilf llolletti after the pris
oner and now Texas has one more
bail character behind tho bars.
Amnrillo mint be a mighty tough
place or the ollb-ers oer there nre u
live bunch, because tin y are continu
ally coming to New Mexico after a
wayward son (or htop-son) which to
our way of thinking i not a very de
sirnble chits of citizen diip.
WHAT MK. 1SIJAEL STANDS FOIl
The News thic week interviewed Mr. i
Joseph Israel, candidate for .Mayor of j
Tucumcari, upon a good government I
platform. In the latt'.r part of last 1
week Mr. Israel and o.her candidates '
i.- Hiied their announcements ns candi-,
elates for variom city ollices, declar-j
lug in their announcements that they
woultl favor certain pe.icies. and di -cuK..ing
these various policies, Air. j
Israel stated to the ' ws:
"I did not seek or desire the office !
of mayor, eir any other oolitlcnl office. 1
I have never been in politics, Aly only J
reason for running for mayor is be
cause many of my friends asked me
lo do so, and I recognize that some
one has to do these things. I hnvo my
property here, my business nnd my
home, and I have been hero for many
years, and if my friends want me for
mayor, I am willing to elovote the
necessary time to help make a better
bigger and more prosperous Tucum-
imy political issue in tais matter, nor
, mnlc perianal fight against any-
"It has already been saiel that I am
running on an anti-saloon f,cK"t. That
is not a fact. I am for reasonable en
forcement of the laws, and tho only
thing that 1 have eleclareel for, other
than the enforcement o " the laws gen-
' vraiiy. is u.r a icu ocii k ciosiiii. nour

for tho saloons. I bob we such n law
will injure no one. I have always
been in favor of law enforcement, and
if a law is not suitable to bo onfoiced
it ought to be repealed. It has been
reported to me. by a aloem man of
the city, that it is understood that I
am running on n ticket which is put
out in behalf of tho . inten- tt'il :ti

jure the saloon nnd prohibit their bird
ness by high license and unfair mean
This is not a fact, ami I will say fur
ther that I would not run on nny tlck
et which required me to elo the bid
ding of any man or faction, but I
propose to elo what appears right and
proper, and to do just as I have de
clared that I will do, provided I have
the support of the council. I will fur
ther say, not only it is untrue that the
prohibition people are controlling me
in any way. but that Harry II. AIc
Elroy, who was chairman of the pro
hibition party in the recent city elec
tion, has .-tateel to me that he is In
I hearty accord with tho policies and
, principles which I have announced
"I am iitit in favor of increasing
' the saloon licence, nn 1 I have good
reasons for not favoring increase of
the license, and belli.. e that hotter
regulation can be soared, ami a hot-
tor co-operation with tho saloon men
I effected, with the snmo license's that
have been paid in the i nst, permitting
a fair profit on the investment encour-
ages obedience of tho law.
1 About eight years ago this state
declared against gambling, games of
chance, innl gambling devices. This
icily likewise has such laws, and I

do not mean by this, that I am against
pool rooms, or any 1 lnl of games,
where they are net pbtynd for monoy,
or used for gnmbUng, nnd I shall not
undertake to romeive pool tables from
saloons or nny other place. I am
against punch board?, and such de
vices, no matter where they are lo
cateel. "No one can except to one state
ment of my announcement unless ho
is simply not in favor of enforcing
tho law. I favor eno new regulation
for the saloon.
"I faor do ing the nloon nt 10:00

will injure no one. I b lleve the profit
made by the saleon elvring tho hours

The das' of buslr.ei s e'.nne by tho sa

run my store until lnte at night, and
consideroel it neccssar-; then it wns
agreed to elowi at "eve n o'clock, nnd
when everybody close 1 at seven, It
made no difference in my business;
now we clo.e m six. and I find it
makes no difference ir. business. The

mits the proprietor o' the business
anel hi employee' to I five more time
feir recreation and mo' time to spend
with their families. I believe thiB Is
fair, reasonable, nnd f ir the best in

In a general way I hr.vo stated what
I intend to do and wh. t. I intend not
te elo. I elo not want ho pcoplo who
vote for me to ex iect -ny more than
I have eleclareel for. I believe in lie
ing fair to everyone, nnd I do not
want theiso supporting 'no to have any
inisunderstaneling of try purposes. I
elo not expect to elo mo-e nor less than
I have declared for, povidcil I have
the support of tho council. I hnvo
always believed that t'ds is tho only
fair way for any candidnte to go be
fore the people.
"It is not necessary for me to make
any statement of my views on tho
question of management of the affairs
anil finances of the city, other than
has already been made in my announce
ment. Those who know trie, know that
I favor progress ive management of
the city, and hnve alwr.ys been in fa

MEN'S DE.MOCKATIC CLUB
If all the signs of the times mean
anything, the Democratic Club which
the young democrats of the town are
attempting to organize will be a live
wire and a succe.-.- from tho start. In
terest is being manifof teii by citizens
beith old nnel young.
Hie purpo-e of the mganization is
to line up the young men who may
yet be pliable in their political views,
and to be a medium thnugb which the
members may more ea-ily keep them
selves pn:-teel on political and public
nirairs. The propo. ed 'irogram of tho
club includes debates i.nd discussions
on political question. The club will
work in harmony with uie ('ounty nnd
State organizations in rolling up the
biggest possible mnj city in Quay
county this fall to help win tho state
for democracy.
A meeting has been called to con

SEVEN UWGS
BURN AT NANA VISA
T
Nora Visa, Alarch 7. - Seven frame-
building wero destroyed by a lire which
originated in u building on Main St.
thnt was being made roudy for a pool
hall. Tho buildings destroyed wore
the ones Just north of tho Commer
cial Hotel, and belonged to John Hums
and tho loss is partly covorcel with
insurance.
One of the burned buildings wmk
filled with baled hay and another con
tained n carload of maize bends. The
feed had been stored by a Dalhart man
named Goodrich, to bo hnuloel to his
ranch in the Alincosa country.
Ntira Visa business men nnd ranch
ers fought n prairie fro for four day
which started 50 miles west and north
of town, and were finally able to get
it under control.
To fight tho fire most of tho mer
chants closed their places of business
and some of them returned oxhnustod.
The fire wns funned by the high wind
and for n time seemed to have gono
fnr beyond control of the firo fighters.
Itcinforccmcnts from Dalhart, Texas,
came to tho scene on a special train.
Thousands of acres of fine wintor
grass was destroyed nnd many home
stondors and small ranchers have been
ruined by the flumes. It was feared
tho fire would reach Nura Visa, but
was stopped before getting this fnr
south.
NEW C ATA LOO FOR UNIVERSITY
Albuquerque, N. M., March 7. More
than one thousand voluntary requests
have come from Now Mexico pooplc
for copies of tho 1010-1017 annual
catalogue of tho Now Mexico State
University. This interesting fact was
disclosed when the new catalog cumc
from tho press this week and distribu
tion begun from tho executive offices.
Tho requests, which hnd been coming
in for the past thrco months, pre
sented a formidable job for the mail
ing clerks and a count showed thrco
times as many demands for tho your
book as had evor been recorded bo
fore. To educutors the demand for the
Univorsity's catalog and for informa
tion about the institution is significant
of a number of interesting things. Tho
first, is of course tho growth of the
University, under tho munugemcnt of
President David R. Boyd. When Dr,
Boyd assumed direction of the Uni
versity four years ngo. this coming
cummer, ho die! so after careful de
liberation und nfter a careful study
of tho field. Ho hnd finisehd sixteen
years of constructive work in tho Uni
versity of Oklahoma, which ho took
with an enrollment of nothing and
left with nn enrollment of 1000, and
ho gave us a result of his survey of
the New Mexico field, the opinion that
a development equally great could be
brought about in New Mexico's Uni
versity. He finnlly undertook the
presidency here with flic r. sertion
that the work was to be ids final ef
fort in bringing tho University up to
standard of attendance proportionate
to tho state's population. It now be
gins to nppear that ho will roach that
mark possibly boforo the five year
poriod has ended. The now catalog
shows this year's frcdhmnn clnss to
number 75. It is now forecasted that
graduating classes from Now Mexico
high schools alone will contribute
moro than 100 to tho freshman class
to enter next August, and with prac
tically every student of this year's
lower clussos returning, an enrollment
of more than 400 is being predicted.
This will bring tho state univorsity
very close to tho mark of a proper
population proportion in its nttenn
ancc. The now catalog outlines a number
of important betterments in course
of study, in increased faculty force,
in equipment and in buddings. Of tho
latter several will be started during
tho coming summor and one or two
may bo completed in time for use
from tho beginning of the next collage
year. The Pueblo type of architecture
is to bo maintained und extended to
the now buildings and it is understood
Unit tho sendees of a famous firm of
landscape architects hnvo boon secur
ed for tho planning of tho now build
ings, ns woll ns tho laying out and
parking of tho grounds.
Construction now Is woll under way
on tho now street car lino to tho Uni
versity campus, and tho recent open
ing of a largo rcsidonco district imme
diately adjacent, and announcement
of a numbor of handsomo homos to
ho built therein, make it qui to certain
that tho next year will witncsB n com
plete transformation from tho old
loneliness of tho Univorsity buildings
into a community of attractive dwell
ings contoring around tho institution.
As nearly all of tho now dwellings will
hnvo room for ono or moro students,
this phase of development will bo of
importance to those who do not caro
for tho dormitory life.
Copies of tho now catalog will tie
mailed on request to President Boyd,
at Albuquerque.
