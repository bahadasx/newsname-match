late yesterday afternoon by Chief of
Detectives J. li. Kicharil. He was
found in South Sioux City. Elliott's
condition was reported to be some
what improved at the St. Vincent's
hospital last night. Collins, who
gave his occupation as an express
driver and his age as 27 years, was
charged last night with assault
with intent to inflict great
bodily injury. When taken Collins
bore knife wounds on 'both hands,
said to have been received in the
fray Monday morning. Detectives
last night asserted that Collins ad
mitted there was a fight near the
Hiebv dace, but he was of the onin-
ion he was not the one who inflicted
tho most serious of Elliott's wounds.
Elliott yesterday was in such condi
tion that the attending physicians
would not permit him to be inter
viewed. According to information
obtained by Chief Richard, the melee
was the outgrowth of a debato over
the prowess of Elliott and Collins,
Sioux City Tribune, 3rd: First
honors in the fat cattle market were
taken down by Julius Lamp, a prom
inent farmer and feeder near Emer
son, but who ships from Nacora,
Neb. Mr. Lamp's consignment to
day consisted of 29 head of steers
that averaged 1,351 pounds that
were good enough to sell at $8.50,
which is the top price for both the
day and week. The offerings were
bought by Mr. Lamp on the local
market four months ago as feeders,
at which time they averaged 1,050
pounds, so the cattle showed a net
gain of 2 pounds per day for the
four months they were in the dry lot.
Mr. Lamp stated that the price he
received today was much better
than he expected Fred Bartels,
of Hubbard, Neb., a frequent patron
of the local market, had in 224 lambs
that averaged 76 pounds that were
good enough to sell at the top figure
for the day, $11.00. "The past two
years have been very profitable to
me, and I think you will find that
the rest of the sheep men will say
the same thing." Mr. Bartels stated.
"The lambs that I had in today have
been in the feed lot since November
and the gain in weight has been a
a very satisfactory one." In all Mr.
Bartels had fed 2,000 head of ewes
and lambs this year and while he has
marketed the big end of the flock
has still a few decks qf ewes that will
bo ready to come in a short time.
As for his ability to top the market
he has constantly done this. He
was the first to land $10.85 and has
twice received $11.00 for his offer
ings on the local market.

RAILROAD EMPLOYES
MUST BE SOBER;
All over the country the rail
road companies are closing down,
on tho litnaov traffic. They realize
that in tho matters of safety and
efficiency the drinking man has no
placo in the service, and the tond
ency is to assist in every move
ment to remove temptation from)
the men by banishing tho saloon.'
A sample order is that of thej
Seattle Electric Company which
has posted the following in its car
barns :
"Employees must abstain while on'
duty from smoking or chewing tobac
co, and from tho usa ot intoxicants.
Tho habitual uso of liquor, tho fro-,
quentlns of places whoro liquor la sold
or carrying liquor about ho person
while on duty or about tho premlsos
of tho company is forbidden.
"It has been necessary during tho
past fov months to remove from tho
norvlce sovoral tralnrnon who have not
observed tho abovo rule. An wo havo
Btated, many times boforo, thoro is no
placo in tho railroad business for any
ono who drinks intoxicants. Wo will
cortninly not tolorato tho uso of liquor
by trainmon either on or oft duty, if
wo can prevent it, as a trainman needs
every faculty ho possesses to bo able
to do his work efflcUntly. '

Iowa saloons all go out of busi

Iativo enactment.
Daring tb last year iu prohibi
tioa Kansas bank deposits have in-'
creased $46,281,300.71. Looks very

Saloon licenses in Chicago have
always been marketable at good
bonuses, but tho Sunday closing
ordor has knocked out tho premi
um -on the business. In tho -want
ads of tho Chicago papers there
ia a veritable panic of offers of
saloons for sale.
Three hundred saloons in New
York City went out of business for
good on tho first of October, and
tho same number are expected to
quit by tho end of tho year, be
cause of the government excise
tax of about $20 a week, and an
extra $300 a. year clumped on by
tho city.
Tho Anheuser-Busch Brewing
company at St. Louis is working
iU great plant only three days in
tho week. To an anxious inquirer
tho manager said that this was
partly due to the season and part
ly to tho spread of prohibition. All
of whioh proves that the increase

about an increase in the consump
