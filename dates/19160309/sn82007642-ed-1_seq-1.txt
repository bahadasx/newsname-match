HUNTING EXPERIENCE OF HARRISON
MIRIDGE.
BY L. D. LOWE.
When Harrison Aldridge was
qnite a young man he concluded
to put in a part o! one fall in the
wilds o! the mountains. During
.the month o! November, aftjer
putting his flint-lock rifle in firijt
class condition, collecting an am
pje supply of powder and bnllee,
he started across the mountains
on one of his rounds. It was one
of those beautiful days during
the period of Indian Bummer,
clear except the peculiae haze
which resembles the smoke from
a distant forest fire, but later in
the afternoon he observed that
the clouds began to form about
the western horizon; he little
thought, however, that a storm
was approaching.
As he was crossing over the
top of a ridge leading from the
main top of the mountain to-
ward an immense bed of laurel,
he saw where the fallen leaves
had been freshly overturned and
he knew that a number of wild
turkeys had just passed over in
to the cove below, so he crept
along through the forest with the
stealth ot a lynx until he could
BOO the turkeys busily engaged in
picking up chestnnts. After selec
ting the largest gobbler as.his tar
get and drawing his long rifle to
his shoulder he fired, and when
the smoke had sufficiently disap
peared the turkeys arose and
flew in different directions, but he
observed that the object of his
aim flew in a straight course fl
yer the top of the tall hemlocks
in the low ground in the thick
bed of laurel until it reached a
tall pine with a deadop when
the huge bird seemed to draw his
wings to his body and drop to
ward the ground, and then he
knew that his shot was not in
vain, provided he should be for
tunate enough to find the tur
key r After selecting a number of
birch and hemlock trees to guide
him to the dead-topped pine, he
entered into the great laurel
thicket to find the dead bird, and
after considerable time he .reach
ed the pine and near the base of
it he found the turkey.
Upon examination Harrison
found that he had learned a les
son that he would not forest:
that in taking aim he had been
deceived by the bulk and the ef
fect of the gun-shot upon a tur
key; that if the bullet should en
ter the breast or too low in oth
er parts of the body the bird U
too apt to rise and fly out of
sight, and if the shot proved 'to
be fatal nine times out of ten the
bird would be lost, or if only
wounded it would upon reaching
the ground at a considerable dis
tance away, conceal itselt in some
hollow log or dense thicket where
it would die eventually; but if
shot about the head, back or oth
er vital spot it would either die
instantly, or be so disabled that
it could not fly and if it under
took to run it would soon be o
vertaben and caught.
As soon as the young man em
erged from the dense laurel the
wind began to howl at a furious
rate, and he could see the rain
falling in the distance. After wal
king Jup the cove for some dis
tance he observed , an immense
ledge of overhanging cliff, which
formed shelter from the rain.
Ashe approached this shelving
mass of rock he observed the
fragments of a hog which had
been slain by a bear and partial
ly consumed; and by the time he
had reached the shelving rock his
clothing was wet from the rain
which was coming oown w i t h
great violent. He found some dry
' wood under the rock ledge and
with flint and steel he soon had a
fire, and after remaining around
it until his clothing was about
dry, he discovered that night
was approaching, and as there
was no prospect of an early a
batement of the storm, he must
content himself with a hunter's
luck under the cliff, so he dressed
the turkey and suspended him
for the night
After eating the remainder of
his lunch he had provided for
bis da 's outing, he recruited his
tire and sat around it listening at
the raging storm until late in the
night, not being provided with
sufficient covering for such emer
gency, he knew he could not
sleep until a late hour, and just
as he was ready to enter into a
little doze he heard the hideous
howl of a wolf in the distance,
and scarcely had this sound died
away until he heard the barking
of another from a different, di
rection, then came the sound of
others from different directions,
and ten they all chimed in and
such yelping, barking and howl
ing the young man had never
heard in his life. This experience
was so terrible as to almost make
the young hunter's hair stand on
end and the blood curdle in his
veins. The terrible noise became
louder and louder and be found
that th wolves were approach
ing nearer so he thought it best
to put more wood.on his fire and
await further developements.
He knew by the noise that
there was a great band of wolves
and he thought it prudent to
take advantage of opportunities,
so he selected a 'shelving rock a
'ew feet above the fire and perch
ed himself upon that with gun in
hand.' He did not have to wait
ong, however, until he heard a
scampering m tne lorest near
where he had seen the fragments
of the hog as he approached the
cliff a short time before. He
could see the glimpse of the wol
ves from his perch, jumping and
darting back and forth, snapping
and snarling over the remnant
of the hog, then one large wolf
threw his head up in the direct
ion of the fire, and when Harri
son saw his ejes shining like two
iilln of fire he took deadly aim
iiiui the won leu ueaa. io soon
er had the wolf struck theground
and the blood began to flow from
the wound than the whole pack
flew upon his prostrate body,
and after they had torn their
companion into fragments and
devoured it they scampered off
into the forest and were gone.
and upon examination in the
morning it was found that only
the hair of the dead won re
mained.

Butlerlzid Republicans.
News and Observer.
The Republican party of North
Carolina is a chattel in the hands
of Marion Butler, the same But
ler who has run the gamut of
politics in this State, the same
Butler who by reason of Fusion
ism wormed his way into office
by the temporary error, of the
people of the State.
In North Carolina it need not
be recounted the things of those
dark days through which this
State traveled that it might a
gain see the light.
Yesterday in the Republican
State Convention Marion Butler
moved the wires which controlled
the Convention, and by means of
the power, he exercised gave clear
proof to those who opposed him
that he was the master of the
situation. He did the cracking
of the whip and the convention
danced obedience to his crack
ing-
The name of Republican Na
tional Committeeman E. C. Dun
can was hissed. When he at
tempted to speak he was howled
down. Then he was thrown out
of office. In vain did another
war horse of Republicanism, Dr.
Cyrus Thompson, seek to have
his say to the convention, for he,
too, was bowled down. And as
the men to whom the Republi
cans of Nqrth Carolina had here
tofore bowed down were humilia
ted to the core Marion Butler
sat on the platform in the plain
view of all and laughed in mock
ery.
The appearance of Marion But-
er on the platform was the sig
nal for wild cheers by the con
vention. From his first gesture
as he faced the convention and
pushed aside a delgate who was
trying to speak it was seen that
lie had the convention well in
land. When there came action
from him which meant that Carl
)uncan as national committee
man must be displaced by Mr.
John Motley Morehead it was
seen that it was a fight to the
finish between the standpat Re-
mblicans under the leadership of
Duncan and the Bull Moose Re
publicans under the orders of
Butler. And Butler won despite a
lesperate struggle on the part of
Duncan.
Carl Duncan made one declar
ation in his appeal to the Repub-
icans to stand by him which was
significant. Speaking of Butler,
who was on the platform within
a few feet of him and indicating
him in the sweep of his hi.ud,
Carl Duncan declared that "It is
not needed in North Carolina
where Butler and I are known to
speak of him. 1 put it up to the
Republican party to decide be
tween me and Marion Butler."
In answer the Republcans show
ed that they chose Butler. And
this was in the face of the declar
ation of Dr. Cy Thompson that
if Butler was given charge of the
Republican party there would a
gain be heard in North Carolina
pf "Butler and Bonds."
The Republican party of North
Carolina is Butlerized. It is in
charge of that man whose name
was signed to an advertisement
in the New York Evening Post
ot April, 1915, which told that
Marion Butler was one of t h e
committee who had put over the
South Dakota bond business a
gainst North Carolina, and that
because of this "The committee
is now ready to proceed with the
collection of all other repudiated
bonds of every class of each
State." And when the Republi
cans go to the people for their
support it will be well for all our
people to remember the past and
to remember that again the Re
publican party of North Caroli
na is in possesuon of Marion But-
ler.

A Law Kith Teeth.
i
. We Jail remember what a fu
rore was raised for a state-wide
primary law and with what a
blare of trumpets it passed the
General. Assembly last winter.
Without some law restraining
the candidates from spending
money too freely this state-wide
primary law might well be called
"an act to put up public office to
the highest bilder." But fortu
nately there is another act pass
ed by the General Assembly of
1913 which was passed to pre
vent the voters of the state from
being debauched and to head off
any wealthy candidate from
spending a big wad in his own be
half. Not many of our people,
perhaps, know of the existence of
such a law. The writer confesses
that he was in ignorance pf it un
til his attention was called to it.
This act makes it unlawful for
any candidate to spend or permit
others to spend for him an am
onnt that would exceed fifty per
cent of the annual salary of the
office for which he is running, ex
cept a candidate for Governor
and a candidate for the United
States Senate may spend or al
low others to spend an amount
not greater than thp annual sal
ary of the office. These two acts,
the state primary act and this
corrupt practice act are intend
ed to go together. The public de
manded this restraint on the
spending of money inordinately
by candidates, but as Boon as it
passed forgot all about it.
It is there however, in cold type,
and it should be invoked wherever
and by whomsoever it is violated
V'e have had enough shatreful
squandering of money in North
'arolina- It not only impover
ishes the candidate but what is
ten times worse, it debauches
and demoralizes the public. We
mavbe allowed to express' the
hope that every candidatjeofany
party in the state this year will
be held strictly to the law. in this
V - 1
respect. The filing of a state
ment showing every cent) expen
ded by himself or by others in
is behalf is on the books and it
means what it says, and any jif-
brt to evade it or nullify at pro
ves the Unfitness of any candidate
to hold any office within the gift
