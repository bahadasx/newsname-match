Postof f ice Has Forwarded to
- Japan $277,147 In the
Ust Six Weeks
Japanese of -the; islands sent 4703
money orders, totaling $123,073.57, to
Nippon yesterday afternoon in the T.
K. K. liner Shinyo Maro,-instead of
the $75,000 the Honolulu postof flee
had estimated would be despatched.
This big sum, showing how much
thA honna to suear plantation labor
ers of the territory has increased the j
postof f ice's foreign money order dus
lness, has accumulated since Novem
ber 28. just 16 days. .
Since bonus payments began, early
in November, the total amounts for
warded by the Honolulu postoffice,
the Japan exchange office for the ter
ritory have been, including yester
day's $123,000, $277,147.73, of which
Si.ri4.074.l6 was sent in November.
The number of November orders was
5072.;;.-
Contrasted with the figures for No
vember of last year, this year shows a
tremendous gain, according to Acting
Postmaster William C. Petersen to
day. In November. 1915. foreign mon
ey order business to Japan was only
$79,53U 1, against this November s
$154,000. For December of last year
the total was only $96,406.50. With
this December only half , gone, yester
day's despatch of $123,073.57 exceeds
the total for December, 1915, by $26,
667.07. And there are 15 days for this
month yet to go. .
The 1916-17 fiscal year total will be
well over a million dollars, the acting
postmaster believes. For the fiscal
year from July 1, 1915, to June 30 of
this year, total foreign money order
business, orders sent from the terri
tory to Japan, was $861,868.05. For
this year, from July 1 to the time the
Shinyo sailed at 5 p. m. yesterday, the
total is already $613,257 and the year
Is not yet half gone. -
By way of further contrast. In No
vember there, came from Japan to
Honolulu only $922.16 in money or
ders. For December to date 'the
amount totals $.13.

BIG BASE HERE
Does Not Believe Government
Likely to Stop Work In
"Key to Pacific" '
Glimpsed In the work which Uncle
Sam is already doing at Pearl Harbor
Is the promise of a great naval base
for Hawaii In the not too distant
future, according to the belief of Rear
Admirai WTillard Herbert Brownson,
retired officer of the navy, who is now
visiting Jn the city.
Admiral and Mrs. Brownson are at
the home of their daughter, Mrs.
Thomas C. Hart, wife of the submar
ine commander. This Is the admiral's
fifth visit in th s city, the first having
been taken when - he was an officer
on tha hteam, sloop-of-war Mohican,
which dropped anchor here in 1869
when Kamehameha was on the
throng and Kilakaua was major of
the household troops.
Islands Key to Pacific
"Any money properly spent hejre in
naval construction is a good expen
diture, ' said the admiral today, "for
these islands are truly the key to
the Pacific. There is no doubt that
the facilities of Pearl Harbor will be
extended. How much, I shall not at
tempt to say, out It is evident that
having expended such suras already.
Uncle Sam will not stop with this."
AdmirM Brownson w ould not offer
a prsdiciion of w hether or not a great
fleet would ever be placed, here. . He
declared the placing of a fleet large
ly a political matter in peace time,
but added that all officials agree on
the fact that tfw- fleet should not be
divided. .
'There won't be a single battle
ship, nor two rr three sent here," he
said. "What good would that num
ber do? If the place is defended with
battleships there will be enough to
amount to somlhing."
The admiral is 71. He retired nine
years apo, but 'eanlng back In an easy
chair on the Hart lauai todky he look
ed not o' er 50. He smiled at recollec
tion of his first visit here, remarking
that hv? can pick out only a few of
the ho ises that stood in the city at
that time, and that many of the pres
ent resilential districts were then
taro patches.
Food Supply is Problem
"Honolulu's food supply in case of
war would depend largely on circum
stances,' he said when asked if this
question might prove serious. "Eng
land as mistress of the seas is even
being led to consider the food supply
question. Men can't fight without
food. And speaking of fighting, the
battleihip still commands the sea in

BOARD PLANS TO

Hereater tin niemLers of the board

the plans and Epeciiicatlons of street
Improvements as they are presented
to theji by thi engineer's office, as
is -evidenced by the action of the
board at :ts last meeting when it voted
to consider the i roposed Puuhul pro
ject : is u comnrittea of the whcle.
Since then a ii'mber of the mera
bers'have statod that the same pro
cedure vill be carried out with all
future projects. This takes it out
of the hands of the road committee
to' som extent.
The itason 'or this was expressed
by Superyisor j.arsen at the last meet
ing wbn he ypoke cf a $16,000 loss
which the city will l.ave to pay and
which iuv. laid to the engineer's depart
ment. ,
Tho n'stako which resulted in the
loss of approximately $11,000 was In
connection with the Manoa improve
ment district and is divided into two
parts, The first, amounting to $6500,
was caused wheu th estimates were
made up. The second is due to an
oversiat in the plans of storm drains
which were so run that in times of a
heavy rain and a resulting freshet, the
grounds of the Mid-Pacific Institute
will be flooded. To remedy this drain
pipes "iii have to be extended, cost
ing in the neighborhood of $9500.
An appropriation for the $6500 has
already been presented to the board
but was tabled lor 'urther considera
tion in the absence of Supervisor
Hatch. The scend amount has not
been -r2t callel formally to the at
tention of the board, but when it Is

part of certain irembers is expected.
The beard as a coirmittee of the
whole will go over the proposed plans

TO BE TORN
Asking that the board' of supervisors
order the Territorial Hotel Company
to tear out the concrete conduits
which It has placed across Kalakaua
avenue, Harry Murray, superintendent
of the water department, has filed a
letter -: with the clerk of the board,
which will be presented this evening
for consideration, v - ,.:
The letter points out that in laying
the conduits the hotel company has
done so contrary, tq law Jt could only
bedone by a permit granted by the
board of supervisors and' that a search
through the records discloses no stich
permit. -' . : ' , . ' .'';' -' .
The letter also says that control of
the city's water supply is involved, for
If a permit Is given and condemnation
proceedings become necessary it
would greatly increase the cost to
the city. Is the opinion of Murray.
In conclusion Murray writes: "I wish
to call your attention to the fact that
the last legislature appropriated funds
for the purpose of drafting legislation
to control the artesian water supply
for the use of the general public." ,
