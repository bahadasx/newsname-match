ESTABLISHED 1845.
STOCK COMPANY
NOW ORGANIZED
Farmers Hold Meeting in the
Court House and Name Offi?
cers For Tazewell County Pure
Bred Shorthorn Association.
The most important movement ev?
er put on foot for the improvement
of Tazewell county live stock was
launched on Tuesday, December 12th,
at the Court House. About seventy
live cattle raisers of the county met
and organized the Tazewell County
Pure Bred Shorthorn Association, In?
corporated.
The meeting was called to order
by the temporary chairman, Dr. Isaac
Peirce. After a few words, stating
the purpose of the meeting, Dr.
Peirce introduced Prof. Hutcheson,
State specialist in animal husbandry.
Mr. Hutcheson made a short talk in
which he emphasized the need of cat?
tle improvement in Tazewell county.
He then suggested a plan of organi?
zation which has worked successfully
in adjoining counties. The advan?
tages of this plan were set forth In
detail. Mr. Hutcheson stated that if
this plan was adopted and pure bred
bulls placed in every part of the
county that the live stock industry
would be benefltted at least $10,000
annually. He pointed out that the
co-operation of every cattle raiser
in the county was necessary in order
?for the organization to 'bring nbout
best results.
After Mr. Hutcheson's talk, the
County Agent read a suggested con?
stitution nnd by laws for the gov?
ernment of the association. This was
fully discussed and then adopted by
the share holders.
The election of officers was then
taken up and the following was the
result:
R. S. Moss. President.
W. O. Barns, Vice-President.
3. Ed. Pecry, Sccy.-Treas.
Tt. M. Lawson and S. J. Thompson
buying committee.
The amount of stock already sub?
scribed is $5,000. A part of this was
paid to the Secretary and Treasurer
at the meeting and it is hoped that
the remainder will be paid at once.
Jf you have not already paid please
sentl check to the Secretary and Treas?
urer at once.
No bulls will be bought until the
?stock js paid in. The members of 'the
Association hope that at least $8,000
will be subscribed. This amount would
?place forty to fifty good pure-bred
Shorthorn bulls in Tazewell county.
If this can be done Tazewell county
-will soon become noted for the pro?
duction of high grade shorthorn cat?
tle equal to any in the country.
The Secretary will send you a re?
ceipt and then a certificate of slock
rat once.
It. R. WALL,
County Agent.
TAZEWELL COUNTY BANKS
HELP FARMERS.
fioon after the County Agent began
the organization of the Tazewell
County Pure Bred Shorthorn Asso?
ciation, the plan was put before all
?of the banks of the county. Greater
interest could not be expected. Most
at the banks have already subscrib?
ed stock to the Association and those
who have not will take the matter
?up at the next meeting of the direc?
tors. None Slave turned the matter
down. Thus far the following banks
have subscribed the Minis opposite
their names:
Basik of Clinch Valley.2 shares
Tazewell National Bank, . .2 shares
First National Bank of Rich
Jands. ,.1 share
Bank of Cedar Bluff,.1 share
(Each share, $50 each.)
The last two banks named stated
that they mav subscribe more and
the final subscription will be pub?
lished later together with that of the
banks not yet heard from.
The farmers of the count" should
deeply appreciate the real interest
.shown by their home banks and re?
member it. This is another advantage
of the Association without which the
farmer would not get the use of this
money to improve his stock. Join
the Association if you want part of
f.jie benefits. In return patronize
your home banks by all means and
remember those that stand by you.
They hare your interests at heart.
, Your success means their success.

County Agricultural Agent.
A CHRISTMAS SERMON.
(By Dr. Lyman Abbott, in the Wo
mon's Home Companion.) |
God was manifest in the flesh?I
Timothy 111:16.
The Apsestle Paul, going to Ath?
ens, found hinusolf in a city full of
various idols, so full that an ancient
satirist said that in Athens it was
ensier to find a god than a man.
Among the altars was one to The
Unknown God. Paul made this inscip
tion the text of his sermon which may
bo summed up in the single sentence:
"Whom therefore ye worship without
knowing him, Him declare I unto
?you." This is the message of Christ?
mas to theworld. What we celebrate
on Christmas is a new unveiling of
God.
"God manifest in the flesh." What
do we mean by that? What I think
is meant is the supremest manifesta?
tion of God possible in human life.
And that is the supremest manifes?
tation possible to humanity. Or, to
restate it in different terms, what is
meant is thnt what Jesus Christ is
seen to be in the three years of his
recorded life, the spirit of God is in
.the history of the human race.
A mother sits down on the floor
nnd plays with her child with build?
ing blocks. If she is a woman of
sympathetic imaginations she is her?
self a child for that hour. She shares
her child'* joys in his brief successes
and his disappointments in his brief
failures.
God lives as child with his children
for an hour that they may become
Clin
acquainted with Him ami know that
He is always living with them, often
most truly "when they see Him least.
There is much in the mother which
remains unknown to the child. These
is much in God that remains unknown
to His children. But the child knows
the mother because the mother has
been u child with him. An' we chil?
dren may know our Father because
He has been a child with us.
? ? *
Three illustrations may help to
make the principal clear.
Jesus Christ is not a manifestation
of certain attributes or qualities of
God; Ho is God manifest in the flesh.
He is not a temporary manifesta?
tion of God's mercy or pity, leaving
his Justice and His anger to be
revealed in the future. There is no
justice and no wrath in God which is
not manifest in Jesus Christ; and
there is no pity and no mercy In Je
nis Christ which is not u reflection of
the eternal pity und mercy of God.
"He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father." To understand Jesus Christ
is to understand God.
Jesus Christ began His ministry by
attending a wedding-feast. His first
miracle was wrought to prolong its
festivities. He repeatedly compar?
ed the kingdom of God to a great
festival. He accepted all social in?
vitations; declined none. Ho declar?
ed Himself that He came eating and
drinking and this wns so characteris?
tic of Him that His enemies called
him a glutton and wine-bibber. He
compared Himself to a musician pip?
ing in the street for the children to
dance. Neither He nor his disciples
observed the customary fasts of the
church to which they belonged. He
was a.favorite with the children, and
they clustered about Him and were
willing that He should take them in
His arms. His last meeting with His
disciples was at a social meal, and
with such a social meal He asked
them ever to associate His memory.
? * . *
If Jesus Christ is God manifest in
the flesh, Cod is not the austere being
lie is sometimes represented. There
is much more truth in the philoso?
phy of the child who said, "God must
have laughed when ho made a mon?
key" than in thnt of the theologian
who said, "JOSUS wept hut never
laughed." Prayer and play are not
incongruous. God is HOt the kind of
father who wishes his children to
hush their laughter when he enters
the house. "? merry heart doeth
irood like a medicine" says the inspir?
ed writer?a motto which might well
be put over the convent-gate or hung
in the prayer meeting room. For to
laugh is as religious as to weep; and
smiles may bring us into the com?
panionship of the Father no less than
tears. Let us got rid of thi" notion
that we must always associate the
thoughts of (iod with a spirit of great
silemnity. Gaiety and God are not
mutually exclusive.
But. Jesus Christ was not all gaiety.
"Woe unto you laughing ones," He
said: "for ye shall mourn and weap."
He had no sympathy for the jester
who can take nothing seriously, hut
tries to make of life one huge pro?
tracted joke. He saw that the whole
world groaneth and travaileth in pain
and He travailed with it. So did He
enter into sorrows of the sorrowing,
so did He make them His own, that
it was prophetically said that He
'was acquainted with grief." The
sorrows might be superficial, and
transient, they might he deep and
abiding, He was not Indifferent to
either. When lie had been preaching
ill day. and evening came, and His
'oyal disciples desirincr for their Mas?
ter some rest, aske Him to send the
congregation away. Ho would not do
it until He had provided for their
hunger. When the brother had died
and the sisters were heart-broken, He
shared grief with them and mingled
His tears with theirs.
* ? *
To some it seems a profanation to
think of God as suffering. To met it
?s n profanation to think of Him as
incapable of suffering. Love suffers
when the love one suffers. If God
is love, Gods knows the sorrows as
well as the joys of love. If Jesus
Christ is Cod manifets in the flesh,
the tears shed at the irrnve of Laza?
rus and at the prospective destruc?
tion of Jerusalem are divine tears.
To me the greatness of the infinite
power and skill manifested at the
same moment in the most distant star
and in our globe by the forth-putting
of the same wisdom and power is not.
os marvelous as the greatness of
soul manifested In n sympathy which
can share at one-- and the same time
the joys of the wedding and the sor?
rows of the funeral. But why should
1 believe His power and His skill are
infinite and refuse to believe that His
sympathies are infinite. His children
crowd about Him, some with their
gratitude, some with their reproach?
es, some exultant with victory, some
humiliated by their defeats, some
'oyous, some in tears., some saints
with songs and some sinners with
?-ino'oss penitence, and He is not
distraught. He hears all voices,
shares all experiences, ministers to
all needs.
To Jesus Christ sin was a disease
to he cured rather-than a crime to be
nunished. It awakened His pity, not
His aiicrer. Condemned for associat?
ing -with sinners, He replied on one
occasion "They that be whole need
not a physician, but the that are
sick." On another occasion He said
that lie had come to seek and to save
that which is lost. And to Him a lost
soul wns a soul not yet found. He
compared such a soul to a coin mis?
laid, which the owner was seeking; to
n sheep strayed from the fold, which
the shepherd was seeking; to a prod?
igal son, whose return the father was
awaiting. There is no one for whom
society has so little hope as a lost
woman; but Jesus never despnircd of
the recovery o? even a lost woman.
Kven the Judas who betrayed Him
He sought to rescue with reproach?
ful greeting. Friend, betrayest thou
the Son of man with a kiss? There
was only one character whoso destiny
He seemed himself unable to avert;
the religious man whose religion was
a false pretense, who was pious, but
not humane; who devoured widow's
homes and for a pretense made long
prayers. The offal of Jerusalem was
carried out of the city into the valley
of Gehenna and there thrown upon
TAZEWELL, VIRGI
fires always left burning, ami there
it was consumed. "Alas! for you
hypocrite," cried Jesus, in an out?
burst of despairing pity, "how can
you escape Gehenna?" To Him such
false pretense seemed like the offal
of the universo.. domed to destruc?
tion.
? ? ?
Jesus Christ, savior of men, is the
revelation of God's perpetual pres?
ence, and perpetual power in the
world. Holiness is health. Sin is
disease. Forgiveness is healing. God
is the Great Physician. We come be?
fore him, not as a criminal to be judg?
ed and punished, but as sick to bo
cured. Those who do not know that
they arc sick and need cure arc the
sickest of all. He is the "Power not
ourselves that nvkes for righteous?
ness." His life in the world is a con?
tinuation of the life of Jesus Christ.
It is the life which centuries before
Christ Duvid saw; which centuries
after Christ so many of Christ's dis?
ciples fail to sec:
Bless the Cord, O my soul,
And all that is within me, bless His
Holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul,
And forget not all his benefits:
Who forgiveth thine iniquities;
Who healeth all thys diseases;
Who redeemcth thy life from destruc?
tion;
Who erowncth thee with loving kind?
ness nnd tender mercies
Who satisfielh thine age with good;
So that thy youth is renewed like the
angel's.
There has been a great deal of
discusion and a great dual of hot de?
bate concerning the rclnllnu of Jesus
Christ to the Infinite and Eternal. Wo
do not know?at least 1 do not know
?enough to define that relation, but
we do know enough to define His rela?
tion to us. That definition may be
very briefly given in the following
words: The supremest work of God
is man. who He has made in His own
image. The sprcmcst revelation of
r:od is therefore that afforded by the
life and character of man. The hUr
innremest ideal of humanity iH Jesus.
Christ. Therefore the supremest rev?
elation of God to ma nis that, to be
found in the life and character of Je?
sus Christ. This is in my judgment
the essense of the theological teach
ins? of Paul on this subject.
We celebrate on Christmas, not the
birth of Santa Claus, the patron saint
of the children; not merely the birth
of the Christ-child, symbol of all in?
nocent child-hood; nor yet alone the
birth of the martyr hero, leader and
type of all who have lived and loved
and suffered for their rare. We cel?
ebrate a new unveiling of God to hu?
manity, the dwelling of God in hu?
manity. We celebrate the day when
the love of God dawned on the world
nnd the fear of the Gods tbegan slow
'v and sullenly to give way before
the coming of the new day. Every
vear Christmas repats its message:
Fear God no more. He borings liberty
to the enslaved, light to the despair?
ing; purer jov to the glad. He is the
comforter of the- sorrowing, the Phy?
sician of the sick; the Healer of the
sinful, the Friend and Companion of
man.

NIA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15,
NO OFFERS OF
PEACE FROM U.S.
Washington Regards Agitation
. .at This Time as Calculated to
Defeat Every End in View.
Would Mislead Foreign Na?
tions as to Our Position.
Washington, Dec. 10,?Offers or
mediation or suggestions of peace to
the European nations have not been
made by the United States, they are
not now being borne across seas by
Ambassador Gerard, and they will
not be broached by this Government
in the near future unless there is
some quite unexpected turn in world
events.
These facts are stated authorita?
tively by one of the highest officials
of the Government to counteract, re?
ports to the contrary which have
been generally published, much to
the embarrassment of the Admin?
istration and to the misleading of
Foreign nations. The facts set forth
and the details following may be said
to express the Administration views
of the situation as affecting pros
pectts for peace.
In official circles it is felt that the
increasing and apparently authorita?
tive rumors that the United States
is planning some move for peace are
calculated above nil else to destroy
chances of peace, and no matter what
their origin, to defeat their own ends.
Indeed the misunderstanding has bo
come so serious that an official deni?
al has been contemplated, probably
through the State Department. The
President, however, has preferred to
dissociate himself entirely from any
such announcement, no matter how
made, in order that he might stand
untrammclcd on his original offer of
mediation at the beginning of the
war,
Two cardinal facts stand out In
the minds of officials: First, that
many such proposals originate In
German circles; second, (hat their
reiteration has been driving allied
statesman to an extremity of refuta?
tion from which it would be very cm
barrassing for them to recede.
Without in any way passing on the
ultimate outcome of the war, it is Hdt
here that Germany has largely achie?
ved her objectives and that she Is In
a position to treat on the basis of her
present gains without subjecting her?
self to tho Inevitable leases of men
and moncv caused by further hostil?
ities.
The Allies, on the other hand, have
shown that they are absolutely op?
posed to peace now. They have left
not the least doubt that they would I
regard an offer of mediation, at this !
time as unfriendly. It is firmly belli?- '?
ved here in official circles that such I
an offer by this Government would
subject the United States to the I
charge of partisan interference in j
the war.
Most embarrassing of all the ru- ;
mors, perhaps, is the constant reit- \
oration that Alaishac|or Gerard is '
returning to Germany with peace I
proposal: from the President This Is
declared, not only to he false, but to |
he actually dangerous. It is said to
have created a very unforturiat fee- |
ling in both belligerent groups, it i
feeling of intense irritation among \
the Allies and of unfounded hopeful- |
ness amopg the German people, who
appear to be well satisfied with the.
war's results and eager for Its end.
The Government will watch an op?
portunity to offer mediation with a
zealousness that could not fail to
come from the chance to put an end
to the most calamitous war in his?
tory. When official reports from all |
sides indicntethat such a movement
might succeed it will he scrutinized I
very carefully before being attemp?
ted. Until then unfounded agitation
by persons not in n position to know
the fundamental and decisive at?
titude of the belligerent nations is re?
garded as best calculated to defeat
the very ends in view.

PATERSON DAVIS DKM).
Patterson Davis, Hurko's Garden's
oldest citizen, is dead. The funeral
land burial took place on Wednesday
from the Central church at It o'clock,
by Rev, W. C. Thompson, pastor of
the Methodist church, of Which de?
ceased was a member. Mr. Davis
was 1)8 years of age, lacking less than
two months. His wife died some '20
years or more ago.
The following are the names of
his children who survive: A. W. Da?
vis, W. L, Davis, with whom deceas?
ed lived; Mrs. lt. K. Moss. Mrs. W.
M. Pruitt, of Clear Pork; Mrs. Cris
mond, Mrs, S. A. Pox, of Cray son
county, and Mrs, F. D. Kerrill", of
Logan, W. Va. Mrs. Crisiuond died
some years ago.
Mr. Davis bad been a very active
man through his long life. Dp to
the summer of 1014, il is said that
he was still able to do light work
lie gave up the activities of life on?
ly when Iiis failing strength and the
weight of years compelled him to
do so.
Mr. Davis was born, from best in
formation at band, in lllaud county.
He came to Hurko's Garden when
quite young. His only slock in trade
.was the plain suit of clothes he won1,
but he had what was better than
money?-ambition, industry and ster?
ling, moral habits. He worked as a
farm hand for several venrs, then
married a Miss Wynn, of Hint com?
munity.
Through bis wife's grandfather he
came into possession of a tract of
land, upon which he reared a fulni
ly of seven children, added \? hi*,
possessions, apd left a goodly estate.
It is well known of him that he was
a very industrious man., und also un?
usually abstemious as to his habits.
Up to a few years ago ho had never
tasted liquor or tobacco. When ho
in to grow very weak be was
persuaded that he needed a Stimulant
which he look sparingly and infre?
quently, lie wan a life-long mem?
ber of (he church and died in the
faith. Wonderful old man. Hurko's
Garden citizens say thai he wa :. (ah
oi| all the way through, one of the
best men they ever knew. Tim exam?
ple of his life is a rich legacy left to
those who comu after him.
HOW TO LIVK CHEAP AM) JUST
AS WELL.
The Lynchburg News says edito?
rially, that it is useless to look lo the
Federal Government, as to a sort of
parent, to ruducu Ilm Cpttt of the ne?
cessaries of life, that when the great
war is over a normal condition will
return, but that each housewife can
if she will, reduce materially the
cost of living, and particularly, if the
housekeepers will get together, an
I hey are doing in the large etiles,
thai they can put. it over on the spec?
tacular extortioners nnd exploiters of
eatables, etc. The Roanokc Times
says that it is up to the women.
There are a number of way., and
means of reducing the grocery and
other bills. Eliminate wastage. Wast?
age is sin no matter how rich we may
be. For instance, take the one thing
of eg)..... Forty cents a dozen or ev?
en thirty cents, is much more than
I hey are worth. Dont buy I hem. If
there wasn't an egg in the United
States everybody would get oil jufcl
as well. The price of u dozen eggs
put lido moat and several other com?
modities, would go twice or three
times as far as the eggs will go.
"Eggs are worth all they will bring."
No, they are not. They are worth
jusl so much in nutrition and value
as food. This is not advocating a
boycott. It is advocating economy.
Farmers can make money on eggs at
'25 cents a dozen, "anil would lake
this price readily, says a good egg
man, if I hey couldn't get more.
And, there is butter. Il Is entirely
possible to use less butter at meals,
says the Lynchburg News. Substi?
tute something else in its place. With
gravy, syrup, preserves, etc., In
spread on a biscuit. 1ml tor is not
needed, nnd its use under the cir?
cumstances is pure extravagance.
The quantity used can be reduced
by al. least half npyway. We eat
too much meat- -reduce tno quantity.
Fruits, home made preserves, oat
meal, etc., not overlooking rice, are
all as nutritious as meat, and much
more healthful. Leaving out. the
question of cost entirely, it is the
duty of every man and woman lo be
economical, particularly these days
when so many thousands of people
are starving.
Left Overs?Cuts and Dogs.
Sjome ono hns estimated thai
enough scraps, left over pieces from
the tables and fed lo the worthless
cats and dogs, or tliU'wn out the
hack window, in the homes of this
town and county, to support a dozen
uuilies. Why, in this town alone
there are not less than 75 dogs and
twice as many cats?all of them sup?
ported from the kitchen tables, all
this is absolute waste, pure and idni
plc, and could bo and should be elimi?
nated.
Take the single commodity, coal, a
household necessity that cannot be
dispensed with. At the most, and un?
der best conditions, only about 25
per cent of the coal we buy is profi?
tably consumed. In the ordinary grate
and furnace not 25 per cent is used.
The rest goes in gasSCS, cinders, and
half burned coal?coke. Look at the
ash piles. They are half coal and
coke. A good suggestion comes from
authentic .sources?"dont burn more
coal than is needed and sift the ash?
es."
And so, on down the line, there are
many litle leaks which may be and
should be, stopped. Tazewell people
are notoriously extravagant. They
have no right to be, even if they are
rich, anil can afford to be. We dont
believe in, advocate, nor practice nig
ardliness, but we do believe in a rea?
sonable, sensible system of economics
and it behooves us all. these days of
'ligh prices?men as well as wom?
en, to do no foolish or unnecessary
spending, and to teach our children
so.
FIFTH SUNDAY.
On the fifth Sunday in this month
I will preach at Liberty at 11 o'clock,
