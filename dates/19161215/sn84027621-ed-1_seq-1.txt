Loss of Wich Town Endangers the Entire Ru
manian Defensive Line
-BREAKING THRU THIS POSITION MAY RESULT HI RUSSIANS ALSO LOSING GALICIA AND
U
BE I
ABIA
(Associated Press)
Berlin announced today the capture
by German troops of the town of
Buzeu just south of the Buzeu river,
where the Russo-Rumahian forces
have been expected to make a stand.
Possible serious consequences both
for Russia and Rumania are seen. If
the capture of the town breaks the
Buzeu defensive line the whole Rus-fo-Rumanian
line along the western
Moldavian border seemed endangered.
It has been stated the Russians must
hold this line if they expected to pre
serve their front in'the Southern Car
pathian's, and even in Galicia. It has
also been indicated that the falling
tack of the Russian front beyond the
mouth of the Danube would open
Bessarabia o invasion.
Buzeu is near the center of a line
Letween the Moldavian frontier and
the mountains and the Danube at the
junction of the railroad from Ploechti
to Ibraila and Galata.
Berlin reported French attacks on
hill No. 304, on the Verdun front, the
Pepper ridge and east of Fort Haud
remont failed.

men including ninety-five thousand
prisoners." We took 135 heavy guns,
80 field pieces and nearly 1,500 ma

ANTHONY
Anthony, Dec. 13. The shower
Monday night was refreshing to the
young lettuce plants.
Christmas will soon be on us. We
are already beginning to se the effects
of the Christmas spirit. Two young
men who are not living more than 50
miles from here came in town not
long ago, as tight as Dick's hatband,
and not on buttermilk, either, and
acted very much like they had been
where there was plenty of booze. But
we will not tell what happened if they
will just promise not to do so again.
Mr. and Mrs. Ed Neff and baby
spent a few days here visiting old
friends and relatives. They were
from Jacksonville.
Mrs. A. P. Baskin has heen very
sick but we are glad to know she i3
convalescing and will soon be able to
be among us again.
Conference is over and the appoint
ments and disappointments have been
read. Rev. C. A. Saunders, who was
appointed to this place will be here to
fill the pulpit next Sunday and every
body is invited to come and hear the
new preacher. But don't come with a
pint of criticism. Let us examine
and see first if there isn't need of im
provement in our selves and get the
beam out of our own eye and then it
may be we can see more clearly. Then
we will be more anxious to know how
we will suit him and not so much
about being satisfied with the preach
er, as we are all human and cannot
expect to see perfection in any one.
The sad news of the death of Mrs.
Louis Lang was a dreadful shock to
this community. Miss Sue, as she was
called,' lived among us, was married
here and had taught school several
terms here. She was loved by all who
knew her and was a faithful member
of the Methodist church. She was an
attractive, pleasant young lady. The
Lord works in a mysterious way. We
cannot understand why a mother
should be taken from a little family,
when she was so capable of bringing
them up in the right way. The par
ents and family certainly have the
sjmpathy of their many friend3. We
all have these heartaches and have
gone through the some sore trials, so
can weep with those that weep.
