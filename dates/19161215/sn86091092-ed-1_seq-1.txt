stalled—Best Equipped Grain Plant
on Main Line of Oregon Short Line
—Improvements Will Cost About
$100,000—Construction Work Will
Start Soon.
Caldwell will soon have the biggest
and best equipped grain plant on the
main line of the Oregon Short Line
railroad. The plans for the enlarged
and improved plant are now being
prepared. Construction work will start
in ample time to handle next season's
grain crop. The additions and im
provements will involve the expendi
ture of about $100.000.
The improvements outlined above
will be made by the Caldwell Milling
& Elevator company, according to a
statement made by Mr. F. C. Lily to
The Tribune Wednesday.
200,000 Bushel Elevator.
One of the improvements that will
be made is a 200,000 bushel grain ele
vator. This elevator will be of con
crete, upwards of 100 feet high and
will cost upwards of $75,000.00. In
addition a concrete warehouse will be
built. These additions will give the
Caldwell Milling & Elevator company
a storage capacity of over 300,000
bushels of grain.
The elevator will be equipped to
load and reload grain with the least
possible delay. The company will be
able to handle 20 carloads of grain a
day with their new equipment. It is
the intention to ship grain here from
all points, weigh, grade and reload it.
New Switching Device.
In order to facilitate the quick and
easy handling of cars a new switch line
will be built. Between the two
switches serving the mill will be a
switching device consisting of an elec
tric motor, car puller, drum and cables
which will enable the mill to do its
own switching.
The new railroad equipment will be
the latest and best thing in that line
that is in use today.
Work Start Soon.
Mr. Lilly was unable to state exactly
when construction work would be
started owing to the fact that struct
ural steel cannot be had as promptly
as in the past. He assured The
Tribune that the plant would be in
full operation in ample time to handle
the grain crop of the coming season.

case
stopped suddenly
Attorney M. H. Eustace, attorney
for the defence in the case of State vs.
Charles Crawford, sprang a surprise
in the district court late Monday,
when he pointed out that Crawford
was charged with a crime not defined
in the statutes.
Crawford had been charged with
assault with intent to commit great
bodily injury. The fact that the Far
go rancher had used nothing but his
fists in his attack upon H. H. Cross,
the complaining witness, was openly
onceded. The mistake in the charge,
under this circumstance, became ap
parent.
After the long process of obtaining
jury had been carried through, with
the calling of two special venires ne
cessitated, the defense suddenly ad
vanced the claim that Crawford was
charged with a crime not listed on the
statutes. Judge Ed L. Bryan con
curred in this view and gave County
Attorney H. A. Griffiths three days in
which to file a new information.
**************
COURT HOUSE BREVITIES *
*****************
District court reopened Monday
after a week's recess during which
Judge Bryan held court in Emmett.
Sixteen talesmen appeared for jury
duty. In the civil suit of the Denver
Lithographing Co., vs. J. H. Laughlin

in placing the judgment at $264.83.
After exhausting two special venies
securing a jury for the trial of
Charles Crawford of Fargo, charged
with assault with attempt to do great
bodily injury on the person of H. H.
Cross, the defense made the claim that
Crawford was charged with a crime
not listed on the statutes inasmuch as
he had used only his firts upon Cross.
The court sustained the claim and
gave the county attorney three days in
which to file a new information.
The case of Bostic vs, Butt, involv
ing a difference over the possession
of a team of horses, occupied the dis

FORMER WEISER MAN
ASSOCIATED WITH TURNER
Alva J. Stewart Will Engage in
Business Here.
Alva J. Stewart, former assessor of
Washington county, was in the city

I family in the capacity of wage-earner
death of child
stirs sympathy
The death in Caldwell Monday night
of his baby boy may be the avenue of
release for James G. Wallahan, who is
serving an indeterminate sentence of
from one to fourteen years in the peni
tentiary for the theft of a horse.
Because of the serious illness of his
little one, a reprieve was granted the
father who arrived just twenty min
utes beiore the baby's death, the time
being extended that he might attend
the funeral at Middleton, the present
residence of his wife and two other
children, Wednesday afternoon. G. C.
Painter acted as temporary guard for
the sorrowing father, and a delegation
of citizens from Middlcton will wait
on Governor Alexander today in the
hope that a reprieve may be secured
for him, that he may be restored to his
and comforter. This hope is based
upon the peculiar circumstances of the
case together with the fact that Walla
han did not claim his right to legal ad
vice and accepted sentence without
trial.
The case is one which has elicited
the sympathy of both Caldwell and
Middleton communities, not alone for
the unfortunate man, but for the
stricken wife and mother who during
her residence in both towns, bravely
and uncomplainingly tried to keep her
children together and at the same
time keep from publicity their father's
plight. It is to be hoped the reprieve
will be granted, and that the husband
and father, having learned his sad les
son through the severe school of law,
will merit and continue to receive the
sympathy and neighborliness of those
who have been instrumental in his
release if it be effected.

ATTORNEY HAWLEY ADVISES
THAT IT IS BETTER TO
MAKE FIGHT IN CON

COURTS.
Fund Authorized to Employ Repre
sentatives to Present Arguments of
the Settlers to Members of Con
gress—Hubbard Fears Politics But
Is Outvoted by Directors—Fight
Will Be Made as at First Con
templated.
The board of directors of the Boise
Water Users' association decided to
accepte the advice of Attorney James
H. Hawley, and make their fight for a
reduction in the water costs before
congress. The board of directors au
thorized an assessment of 10 cents an
acre for the expenses for the coming
year. It is understood that such por
tions of this fund as is needed will be
used to send representatives to Wash
ington to present the matter to con
gress. e
Director D. R. Hubbard was much
opposed to the plan adopted. He and
Director Spaks voted against the as
sessment.
Disclosure of the fact that one of
the directors had evidently voted
himself out of office through author
izing new contracts with the govern
ment on the part of Nampa & Meri
dian district water users constituted
a feature of the meeting. This direc

AND THE VILLIAN STILL
PURSUES—DECLARES HOLMES
Bad
Man of Fox Films Finds
Cannot Be Good.
He
Sturat Holmes' reputation as a vil
lain precedes him wherever he goes.
He never realized it until a few days
ago, when a strange thing happened
to him in New York.
Holmes was in the city between
scenes in "Under Tow Flags," the
William Fox photodrama, in which he
plays Chateauroye, the villain. Walk
ing along Forty-sixth street, he saw
an orange rolling down the sidewalk
by his side. He stooped and picked it
up, then saw that it belonged to a little
boy who was coming down the street
with his mother, and walked toward
him with the orange.
The child held out his hand, and
Holmes reached the orange toward
him. Then the woman started.
"Don't take that orange, Willie,"
she said. "He's a bad man, and there's
no telling what he's done to it."
Holmes was puzzled.
"I haven't had a chance to do any
thing to it," said Holmes, "and if I
had. why should I?"
"I've seen you do thaings worse than
that in the movies," said the woman,
'and I won't trust you now."
Willie began crying, the woman
dragged him down the street, and
Holmes remained motionless, with the
orange in his hand.
"Being a villain has it draw-backs,"
said Holmes in telling the story after
wards, "but that was one of the best
oranges I ever ate." At Bungalow,
