F- A. Wardwell. G.G. Thompson
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Thi9 week has marked an epoch in the
war situation in Europe. It may lead to
a final agreement on terms the two fac
tions may agre upon. Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg submitted a message
to the Reikstag on Monday settiug forth
terms on which the Central powers are
willing to settle the war. It is far more
liberal than anything ever suggested be
tore, although it is couched in language
that shows that Germany don't want to
sacrifice any territory—all she wants is
to get back the foreign possessions she
has lost, and she is willing to restore
Belgium, give back to France what ter
ritory she has occupied since invading
the western front aud she makes certain
provisons to compensate her allies on cer
tain lines.
The proposition was given to the min
sters of nutral countries to be forward
ed to England and her allies for consid
eration.
That the proposition will be rejected
there is no doubt. But we believe that
it opens further negotiations that will
have a tendency to settle their differenc
es. There is no doubt but that all the
warring nations are ready to quit, the
only question is how they can come to
terms satisfoctorily to all concerned
The general belief is that Germany
saw an opportunity, after their sweeping
victories over the Serbians and the cab
inet crisis in England and France that
both would be ready to discuss settle
ment.
Fighting is still going oh in the
and on the eastern lines, but very
progress is made by either armies.

FOR FARMERS TO THINK ABOUT.
If a farmer has the faots he can draw
his
conclusions. He has plenty of
time to think, kind his thinking gener
ally
workB
accurately. He can plow, a
field and think at the same time. So
when he grapples with the Tariff ques
tion, and reads in the Government re
ports the facts that in nine months, un
der the Republican Tariff law, we im
ported cattle to the value of $5,680,733,
on which the importers paid into the
treasury a duty of $1,533,178, while in
the same length of time, under Demo*
cratic Tariff laws, we imported cattle to
the value of 916,540,435, on which the
importers paid not one cent of duty, the
farmer is sure to reason out the con*
elusion that the industries of this coun
try were drained to the extent of more
than 911,000,000 and the treasury was
deprived 91,500.000 of revenue. The
Democratic Department of Commerce
is authority for the statement of facts.
We have the admission, therefore, that
the Democratic Tariff law caused an in
crease of $ll,6ii0,000 in the purchases of
foreign cattle—Mexican and Canadian
chiefly—and a corresponding decrease
the demand for American cattle.
Dm American farmer can plainly see
tltot his market must have been injured
by this increased competition. He can
also see thai if ihe Treaury had receiv
ed that million and a half of revenue,
along with numerous other amounts
that the Democratic Tariff law cut off,
we should not now have a deficit of 972,
000,000.
The recent eletion as,closed a total
of 5887 saloons and 99 breweries and dis
tilleries in four states. Nebraska 392
saloons and one brewery were closed.
South Dakota closes 200 saloons, Michi
gan oloses 3208 saloons and79 breweries,
Montana closes 1587 saloons and 19
breweries. Over two million population
weie added to the dry population of the
country. One half the nation is now
"dry" and the end is not yet.
The ^newspaper fraternity will learn
with regret that the grim reaper of
death has visited the homes of two sis
ters of Editor Fairchild of the Cavalier
Chronicle within the last month. Mrs.
R. B. Moe, of Port'and, Michigan died
on November 25th, after a stroke of par
alysis. Mrs. William Broad, another
sister who attended her sister during
her sickness returned home to Owosso,
Michigan and died on Thanksgiving day.
Meeting of School Dlrectora.
A meeting of the school directors of
Pembina County was held at the Court
House in Cavalier and the following,
resolutions were adopted:
The committee calls attention to the
resolutions passed at the last meeting
with reference to sehool nurse, and re
commends that resolution be pass
again in this meeting and the matter
thus be brought to the attention of the
County Board. The resolution in ques
tion reads as follows.
Resolved: Whereas, it is the unani
mous opinion of the school officers of
Petubina County in meeting apsembled,
that a competent nurse should be em
ployed to visit all schools in the county
and examine all children for physical
defects. We therefore respectfully sub
mit the resolution to the Honorable
Board of Count} Commissioners of
Pembina County for their consideration,
with the request that they take steps to
engage such nurse. We deem that such
measure will meet with the approval
of the tax payers of tbe county, as auth
entic reports presented at the meeting
from countries where such safeguard
for the health of the children is provid
ed show the benifits far in excess of the
expense incurred.
Resolved: That it is the sense of this
meeting that consolidation of schools is
desirable and should be encourage in
our county wherever conditions are fav
orable.
Resolved: That school officers, teach
ers and parents should encourage the
practise of providing a hot lunch in the
rural schools at dinner hour.
Resolved: That the school officers
should follow up as well as possible the
work of this meeting by bringing the
matters here disscussed to the attention
of the patrons of schools and thus dis
seminate information and foster interest
in matters pertaining to the schools.
Resolved: That a copy of these res
olutions be sent to all of the local news
papers in the County.
Resolved: That tbe meeting express
es its gratitude for the able manage
ment shown in arranging for this meet
ing and for the excellent addresses that
were delivered.
Resolved: That meeting expressed its
appreciation at the excellent attendance
at this meeting and encourages school
officers to continue their interest in
these matters, and bring them to the
highest state of efficiency.
