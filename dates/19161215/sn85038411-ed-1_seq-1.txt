Christmas
More than three inches of snow fell
during the morning in the first big
storm of the winter. Fair and cold
er weather will follow to-night with
a drop in temperature to 15 degrees.
Continued cold weather will prevail
to-morrow, according to government
forecasts.
The storm is general throughout
the eastern section of the country
and the cold wave which is follow
ing it across the States may keep the
mercury down for several days. Ac
curate forecasts are difficult because
of the varied weather conditions all
over the country.
In Chicago, Detroit and other Mid
dle western cities zero weather pre
vailed during the night, while off the
Carolina coast the mercury registers
60 degrees.
Traffic Delayed
In many parts of Pennsylvania snow
began falling during the early morn
ing hours and is expected to continue
until nightfall, in the morning hours
in the city, traffic on the trolley car
lines was congested because of the
big Increase in the number of pas
sengers, and the wet rails. Three
sweepers were sent out by the Harris
burg Railways company, and by noon
practically all of the cars were run
ning on schedule.
Additional men were employed by
the city highway department to open
street crossings in all parts of the
city, and as soon as the storm passes
the snow will be shoveled from the
business streets and hauled to the
river.
Slightly warmer weather is expect
ed on Sunday, but with the cold wave
area in the Middle West sweeping
eastward, another big drop in temper
ature is predicted during the early
part of next week. No thaw is ex
pected before Christmas.
The railroads were hit hard. Keep
ing the trains on schedule time was
a difficult task. Most of the trouble
was in the west, the through trains
on the Pennsylvania Railroad being
from one to two hours and a half
late. Local trains with heavy traffic,
due to the Christmas rush were re
ported from 10 to 30 minutes late.
Officials of the Pennsy said the
storm was unexpected, and the track
foremen were not prepared. There is
also a scarcity of trackhands which

Pennsylvania Railroad
Advertises For Men
For First Time in Years
Pennsylvania railroad circles were
startled to-day when notices , were
posted at freight and passenger sta
tions as follows:
"The Pennsylvania Railroad
will consider applications for
positions for firemen, brakemen,
machinists, shopmen, trackmen,
truckers, etc. For application
blanks and further information,
apply to local agent.
"W. B. MeCALEB."
Employes who have seen a half a
century of service and are. nearing
the time for retirement cannot recall
when the Pennsylvania Railroad ad
vertised for help. Department heads
said there is a scarcity of men.
Wheat Crashes on Rumor
That Universal Disarmament
Will Be Discussed at Parley
Chicago, Dec. 15.—Wheat crashed
down in value to-day. First sales
showed a fall in some cases of 8%
cents a bushel. May wheat touching
$1.58 as against $1.6614 to sl.66<! a at
yesterday's finish.
Prices varied as much as five cents
at the same instant in different parts
of the pit. The opening range for May,
the chief trading option, spread from
158 to 161. Waves of selling accom
panied the exciting break In values.
What chiefly sent prices whirling
downward was the statement author
ized by the German embassy In Wash
ington that one of the most Important
subjects for discussion at a peace par
ley would be universal disarmament.
Besides the German embassy state
ment referring to a limitation of arm
ament the smash in wheat prires was
due largely to yesterday's and this
morning's breaks In the New York
stock market. Yesterday's big decline
In New Yoi'k came too late to have
much Influence here until to-day.
The decline at the outset this
morning made a. total drop |p wheat
prices of about 18 cents a bushel since
the first peace olTer caino from Berlin.
After the opening, still lower prices
were reached, the extreme being 1
for May. Then the pressure became
relatively exhausted and houses that
of late have been free sellers, took to
the buying side. Rallies, however, were
not well manltained.
Within an hour losses had been
widened to 10% cents a bushel. Wheat
May, tumbled to $1.56. As compared
with prices a month ago, December was
down more than 45 cents a bushel.

DRASTIC EFFORT
TO RELIEVE CAR
SHORTAGE STARTS
Emergency Measure Is Design

Washington, Dec. 15.—Drastic reg
ulations adopted by the railroads went
into effect to-day with the approval
of the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, as emergency measures to re
lieve the shortage of freight cars
which for months has been a brake
on the country's commerce and af
fected the high cost of living.
The remedy Is the railroads' own,
proposed by the car service commis
sion of the American Railroad Asso
ciation and approved by the Federal
Commission. The first regulation pro
vides that a consignee may have the
usual two days to unload a car and
that thereafter demurrage shall be
charged at the rate of $1 for the first
day, $2 for the second, $3 for the
third and $5 for the fourth and each
succeeding day. Heretofore the charge

DANES ENDORSE
SALE OF ISLANDS
283,000 Votes in Favor of
Transfer of Danish West
Indies to U. S.
Copenhagen, Dec. 15, via London.—
The plebiscite held yesterday on the
question of the sale of the Danish
West Indies to the United States re
sulted in 283,000 votes being cast in
favor of the sale and 157,000 against
such action.
The endorsement by popular vote in
Denmark of the proposal to sell the
Danish West Indies to the United
States means that the matter will now
bo taken up by the Riksdag, the Dan
ish parliament. A treaty for the sale
of the islands was concluded between
the United States and Denmark in
New York on August 5, of this year,
the purchase price being fixed at $25,-
000,000. The treaty was ratified by
the United States Senate on rieptember
Considerable opposition to the pro
ject developed in Denmark, the ques
tion being used by the opposition as
the basis for a determined fight on
the administration. The sale bill was
finally passed by the Landsthing, or
upper house, and wus then referred to
a Joint committee which summoned
a number of witnesses. Including dele
gates from the Islands. The Island
representatives endorsed the transfer
and it was finally decided to hold a
plebiscite.
The Danish archipelago included
the Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix
and St. John. St. Thomas Is 38 miles
east of Porto Rico and directly in the
line of Panama canal traffic. It has
an area of 33 square miles and a pop
ulation of'about. 11,000. St. Croix has
an area of 83 square miles and a pop
ulation of about 18,000. St. John Is
tho smallest of the group with an
area of 21 square miles and a popu
lation of 900.
The proposal of the purchase of
these islands, first came up during the
Lincoln administration and was also
considered when Theodore Roosevelt
was In the White House. There have
been reports from various sources
that Germany desired to obtain pos
session of the archipelago, but the
reports have never been confirmed
from any olllcial source.
FALL OF BUZEU
ENDANGERS RUSS
WITH RUMANIANS
Whole Allied Line Along Mol
davian Mountains Imperiled
by Teutons
Possible serious consequences not
only for the Rumanians but for the
Russians are implied in to-day's an
nouncement from Berlin of the cap
ture of the Rumanian town of Buzeu.
Military writers have very largely
assumed it to be the Russo-Runianian
intention to make a defensive stand
along the line of the Buzeu river, run
ning in a general easterly direction
not far from the southern border
of Moldavia, Rumania's northern pro
vince. The town of Buzeu lies just
south of this river, near the center of
the line between the Moldavian fron
tier mountains and the Danube, and
at the junction of the railroads run
ning from Ploechti to the Danube at
Ibraila and Oalata, northward through
Central Moldavia and northwestward
to the West Moldavian frontier.

DUTY OF U.S. TO
LEAD PEACE MOVE
Capper Tells Governors, Amer
ica Is Confronted With Great
Responsibility
Washington, Dec. 15. America is
confronted to-day with the responsi
bility and duty of leading the move
ment for universal peace and to in
sure that such wars as that of the
present shall no longer disturb the
world. Governor Arthur Capper, of
Kansas, told to-day at the conference
of governors here.
"Upon the American people," said
Governor Capper, "rests the responsi
bility and duty of leadership In the
movement for permanent peace
among civilized nations. It is no quix
otic enterprise to which we are called.
We are not meddlers In the affairs of
others when we say that war must
cease. The interdependence of na
tions, the bonds of commerce and fin
ance, entirely aside from the dictates
of common humanity make It impos
sible for this plague of war to exist
anywhere upon the globe without ser
iously affecting both our international
relations and our domestic affairs.
Our protest is not sentimental, al
though we thank God we are moved
by human suffering and the waste of
human life by this destroying world
sickness.
Through such agencies as the pro
nosed League of Nations to Rnforce
Peace or the World' Court League
which prepared commission of all jus
tifiable questions at issue between na
tions to an international tribunal,
Governor Capper declared the object
might be obtained.
"The United States," he said, "Is
the logical nation to begin this move
ment for which destiny has now pre
pared mankind. Never before since
the dawn of history has such an op
portunity been presented to any nation
as now comes to ours. Our task Is to
keep one single Issue burning into the
general human consciousness; that the
world can and must find some other
way to nettlo differences of opinion
than by the slaughter of men and the
starving of women and children."
WILSON TO AWAIT
PREMIER'S SPEECH
BEFORE ACTING
Will Not -Determine Formal
Peace Steps Until Lloyd-
George's Address
Washington, Dec. 15. President
Wilson probably will not llnally de
termine on any formal steps in con
nection with the peace proposals of
the Central Powers until after David
Lloyd George, the British prime min
ister, has spoken in the House of
Commons Tuesday.
In the meantime through the Am
erican diplomatic representatives in
the capitals of the entente powers the
American government will keep in
close touch with the situation.
No formal comment was forthcom
ing to-day either from the White
House or the State Department. It is
known to the vfrew of most of the cab
inet members that the American gov
ernment should move cautiously and
do nothing to imperil its influence for
peace.

French Liquor Dealers
Fear Ruin Because of
Alcoholic Beverage Ban
Paris, Dec. 15. —The decision of the
government to prohibit the consump
tion during the remainder of the war
of alcoholic beverages, with the ex
ception of wines and beer, has caused
consternation in the liquor trade, al
though it is but the logical culmina
tion of a series of restrictive measures
which have been taken since the out
break of hostilities, such as the sup
pression of absinthe In March, 1915, the
doubling of the* tax on spirits last June
and the granting to private individuals
of the privilege of distilling spirits
from the products of their own lands.
M. Grlzard, president of the provision
Dealers' Association, declared the new
measure will bring ruin to 380,000
saloonkeepers now mobilized and fight
ing for their country, and that it will
dry up one of the sources of national
wealth. On the other side it is pointed
out that, aside from consideration of
the health of the people, alcohol is
needed urgently In the manufacture of
munitions, for which purpose Increas
ing quantities are being imported.
Tho amount expended for this pur
pose In the present year Is about 130,-
000,000 francs, compared with 30,000,-
000 francs last year.
M. Hiemaln, secretary of the Anti-
Alcohol League, says the prohibition
measure will not injure the saloonkeep
ers, but on the other hand will benelit
them, as they would get small profit
with the doubled taxes on spirits while
the sale of wine, beer, eider, tea and
coffee will yield handsome returns. The
distillers will loose nothing, M. Hiemaln
contends, as their whole output will
be taken for industrial purposes.

DISARMAMENT TO BE
CONSIDERED IN PEACE
PARLEY TEUTONS SAY
German Embassy Authorizes Statement That at Least Les
sening of Armament Would Be Discussed if Peace
Conference Is Held
OFFICIALS AT WASHINGTON AND
FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WILDLY EXCITED
Eagerly Thresh Out Announcement; Kaiser Threatened
Withdrawal From Second Hague Conference if Simi
lar Action IVas Mentioned
Washington, Dec. 15. The au
thorized statement at the German em
bassy that consideration of at least
partial disarmament would be one of
the things taken up at a peace con
ference attracted the widest attention
among government officials and diplo
mats here to-day. It was accounted
doubly interesting because Germany
had repeatedly refused such sugges
tions, even to the point, it was said,
of threatening to withdraw from the
second llagtie conference if the sub
ject were pressed.
Disarmament formed practically
the whole basis of the Russian cir
cular note of August 12, 1838, propos
ing the first Hague conference. The
note declared "in checking the in
creasing armament and in seeking
the means of averting the calamities
which threaten the entire world lies
the supreme duty to-day resting upon
all States."
Atterttion was called to the resulting
economic crisis, the continual danger
lurking in big military and naval
forces, their crushing burden and the
fact that they must "Inevitably lead

Washington, Dec. 15. A bill prohibiting the trans

to the very cataclysm it was designed
to prevent."
The first conference adopting the
suggestion ot' a subcommittee decided
"the restriction of military charges is
extremely desirable for the increase
of the moral and material welfare of
mankind." Nevertheless owing to the
attitude of some of the powers and the
difficulty of agreeing on an interna
tional plan the matter was left to the
various nations without direct sug
gestion.
When the call for the second con
ference in 1907 it became unmistak
able that Germany would not discuss

them was made in the call, but the
United States and Spain reserved the
liberty to bring the question forward.
