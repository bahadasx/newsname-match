Hartley mills. Sixteen gunmen from
Seattle, hired by the Clough-Hartlry

are on duty at the mill and acting as
escorts to non-union shingle weavers,
which is entirely unnecessary.
On the hill above the Great North

infamy.
The consideration of this part of
the report was referred to the order

oiiler Of new business a motion pre
vailed to endorse a proposition from
the Shingle Weavers to circulate a
petition for the signatures of tax
payers In Snohomish County, protest
ing against paying the bills for the
special deputies of Mcßae. The fol
lowing is the text of the heading of
the petition:

Commissioners:
• Whereas, Tin 1 county authorities
have seen fit to hire and deputize
Bpeoial imported gunmen and thugs

"Olympia, Washington,
"There is intense feeling in Everett
on account of employment, of gunmen

Perry Taylor, secretary of the State
Federation of Labor, addressed the

applauded by the delegates.
After a few short speeches on topics
of interest to the unions the Council
adjourned.

FAVOR STATE PRINTING
OF ALL TEXT BOOKS
Since the co-operation of agricultu
ral and labor organizations has ac
complished much good in the State of
Washington, it seems desirable that
they get closer together to the end
that they may better understand their
mutual interests. Here's a chance to
co-operate.
The Skagit and Snohomish County
I'omona granges, favoring the uni
formity of school text books, have
adopted resolutions suggesting that
all text books he printed by the state
in the interest of economy and the
retention of the money spent for them
within the state.
We reprint the resolutions adopted
by tin 1 Snohomish County Pomono
Grange, which met at Arlington week
before last, from the Snohomish Ad
vance:
Whereas, Industrial betterment, in
the last analysis, means industrial ef
ficiency and the elimination of indus
trial waste, and
Whereas, According to gathered
statistics, two concerns alone supply
84 per cent of all the American text
books, controlling the scheme of edu
cation of our children, exacting ex
cessive profits and having a history
of graft and corruption, and
Whereas, Uniformity of text books
throughout the state would be of mu
tual benefit to instructors and
students and state printing of text
books would add an industry to the
state and keep our money at home,
and
Whereas, Free distribution of text
books to the children of the state is
in full accord with the democratic
spirit that gave rise to and dominates
our schools, therefore be it
Resolved, That we, Pomona assem
bled, November 21st, 1916, endorse the
Skagit County Pomona resolution and
the action of the state grange in the
matter of uniformity of text books,
the state printing and free distribu
tion of same.
Resolved, That a copy of this reso
lution be sent to Governor Lister and
that same be brought before the 1917
session of the legislature,

POSTAL EMPLOYEES
BACKED BY A. F. OF L.
The postal workers of the country
are going to the second session of the
Sixty-fourth Congress for remedial
legislation backed tip by the support
of the American Federation of Labor.
The A. F. of B. convention at its
session in Baltimore endorsed the
following resolutions:
Higher Wages for Postal Employees
Whereas, The wage scales existing
in the Postal Service governing the
wages of postoffice clerks, railway
mail clerks and city letter carriers
were fixed in 1907 and are woefully
inadequate to meet the present-day
cost of living; and
Whereas, Postal employes are high
ly specialized workers who function
in a government monopoly with no
hope of receiving a higher wage from
a competing industrial establishment,
performing a service which gradually
unfits them for employment else
where; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we, the American
Pederation of Labor, in convention as
sembled, indorse the attempts of af
filiated postal workers to secure a
higher wage scale from the Sixty
fourth Congress and instruct the Ex
ecutive Council lo render all possible
assistance.
$200 Increase
Whereas, The present rates of pay
of practically all of the employes of
the United States of America In the
classified Civic Service were fixed by
enactment of law in 1853; and
Whereas, The salaries and wages of
all classes of workers, especially
those organized, have very materially
increased during the period since
1853; and
Whereas, The duties of government
employes, the requirements as to their
abilities and the hours of work, have
from time to time during the period
since 1853 increased; and
Whereas, The salaries and wages of
the president of the United States, the
vice president, the members of the
cabinet, the heads of all independent
bureaus and commissions, the mcm
i hers of congress, the judges of all
! United States courts, the United
j States marshals, the officers and en
listed men of both the army and
navy, and of a vrey large percentage
of the supervisory government of
ficials have been increased from time
to time until now these salaries and
wages are a great deal larger than
they were in 1853; and
Whereas, The actual cost of the
necessities of life has increased dur
ing this period, and especially during
the last decade, to such an extent that
it is now almost impossible for a
classified civil service employe to
support himself and family on the
wages paid by the United States;
therefore, be it
Resolved, By the American Federa
tion of Labor, in convention assem
bled, that the president of this organ
ization and the Executive Council be,
and they are hereby instructed to use
every effort to have the congress of
the United States enact a law grant
ing to all government employes in the
classified civil service a horizontal in
crease of salaries or wages, amount
ing to at least $200 per annum; and,
be it further
Resolved, That the same conditions
confronting the employes of the Dis
trict of Columbia, the same effort be
made to secure for them such an in
crease in pay as will equalize the
rates of pay of the employes of the
District of Columbia and the employes
of the United States.
Reduction of Night Work
Whereas, Thousands of postoffice
clerks throughout the country are
compelled to work nights under con
ditions inimical to their mental and
physical well-being; and
Whereat, Tlie Postal Federation of
Postoffice Clerks is endeavoring to]
eliminate unnecessary night work in
the postal service by securing a time
differential of fifteen minutes in
every hour worked after 6 p. m. and
prior to G a. m. for postoffice clerks
and letter carriers—a legislative re
form beneficial to the men and the
service; and
Whereas, There is pending before
the Sixty-fourth Congress the Randall.
Lewis bill, which will accomplish this
reform; therefore, be it
Resolved, That this Thirty-sixth An
nual Convention of the American Fed
eration of Labor indorse the Randall*
Lowis bill, and instruct the Executive
Council to co-operate with the repre
sentatives or the National Federation
of Postoffice Clerks in seeking its
passage.
Railway Mail Legislation
Wherens, The cost of living has in
creased greatly during the past four
years and yet during that time the
THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST
EVERETT. WASH., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1916
salaries of railway postal clekra have
been decreased —
By working substitutes without giv
ing them an appointment.
By cutting the salaries of transfer
and terminal clerks.
By reducing the classification of
[ certain lines.
By taking mail from lines of high
classification and working il in lines
of terminals where lower classifica
tion exist, thereby reducing the force
of the higher class lines.
Resolved, That this Thirty-sixth An
nual Convention of the American Fed
eration of Labor indorse the efforts of
the affiliated railway postal clerks to
secure legislation which will correct
these conditions and also their efforts
to secure a higher wage scale, and in
struct the Executive Council to co
operate with the Brotherhood of Rail-
I way Postal Clerks in seeking legisla
tive relief in the Sixty-fourth Con
gress.
PERSECUTION
OF PRISONERS
From an article in the Northwest
Worker the following statement con
cerning the treatment of the I. W. W.
prisoners in the county jail is clipped:
"The men in jail in Everett are be
ing constantly subjected to petty per
secution. They have all been photo
graphed and finger-printed by officials
of the Slate Board of Prisons, al
though yet unconvicted! This was
made the excuse for nol letting At
torney Moore into the jail on Friday,
the 24th. He was not allowed to see
his own clients! Prosecutor Webb
tried to get Moore into the jail, btit
Sheriff Mcßae was Implacable.
"This same sheriff also refused to
allow any dainties to be seal into the
jail for the boys on Thanksgiving.
Friends of the men and local sympa
thizers had planned to send them a
Thanksgiving dinner. But, out of
sheer malice and gratuitous brutality,
the sheriff forbade the food being
given the men. This has but added to
(lie growing sentiment in Everett
against the sheriff and the prosecu
tion. The daily pres:; of Everett is
completely under the sway of the lum
ber interests, it seems. For instance,
Ihe Everett Herald of November 2f»
says that Attorney Fred Moore tasted
the prison food and praised it highly.
This article actually slates that Moore
said that the prisoners were 'given
as good food and as much of it as
they could wish.' When Moore saw
this 'interview' In the paper he was
astounded. The story was a deliberate
piece of misrepresentation. Disclaim
ers have been sent to the Everett
papers, but have not been printed."
It seems that in this enlightened
day we know not at what moment
some official, a "public servant,"
elected by the people, may revert to a
condition of savagery. These pris
oners, guilty or not guilty, are help
less now. Bet the public think the
rest.

EVERETT TRADES COUNCIL.
OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
TWO GREAT LAWYERS
FAVOR LABOR UNIONS
On November 7, when the Building
Trades Department of the American
Federation of Labor was called to
order, X. K. Reeves, chairman of the
legislative committee of Maryland
Railway Trainmen, was the first to
address the delegates. He welcomed
them to the state, expressing himself
as emphatically favoring "closer allied
af filial ion.''
William Broering Speaks
William Broering, the state's attor
ney, followed with a further word of
welcome. He commended the organ
ization for its objects and purposes
and for "doing the things the indi
vidual cannoi hope to achieve for him
self. * * * I believe you are just
as loyal to our country, just as loyal
to its institutions and that you do
those things Which make your city
the host in (he state, your stale the
best In tho nation, and your nation the
best In the world."
i In dealing With unemployment Mr.
j Broering suggested that state or mu
nicipalities provide "emergency im
provement work that will not In any
j way compete with honest labor or
affect labor organization, where men
can be kept self-respecting by making
them self-sustaining, but it must be
I done in a way that will not affect, the
standard wage of the community."
Attorney General Straus Talks
When Chairman O'Rourke intro
duced Attorney General Isaac Loeb
Straus he eulogized him as the "fore
most constitutional lawyer In Mary
land, a man who never fails when
called upon to do something for labor."
j Mr, Straus said: "I want to say,
I not as a compliment, but in all sin
cerity, thai I consider it an honor
to speak at this meeting. Although
I there are a great many useful, service
able things a man might do, there is
nothing I can think of as really use ful
'and as actually Important and ser
j v'.ceable as speaking to laboring men
| organized in their associations and
[ speaking for their just rights. * » *
The supremest temporal thing that
i should concern the minds of men is
that a man is more valuable than
money, and that people l are more
precious and important than property.
* * * You represent to me as I
stand here the supreme hope ulti
mately of democratic institutions."
.Air. Straus sa ; d he viewed the labor
organizations as a body of men band
ed together to do what they ought
to do, protect themselves, lift them
selves, advance themselves, and strike
down every interest that is militantly
hostile to the well being of them
selves.
"You ought to rule, not through dis
order or violence, but as free men
engaged with the duties of self-gov
ernment at the ballot boxes of the
nation. * * *
"Generally you are right in your
organizationi in the high things you
stand for; it's the duty of every
honest freeman to put h's shoulder to

THE LARGEST IRON ORE DEPOSITS AND
HOW THE STEEL TRUST KEEPS THEM
By HARRISON GEORGE
Eight billion dollar combine of
CAPITAL io fight organized LABOR!
Such is the weight of the oppressive
forces headed by the U. S. Steel Cor
poral ion. To realize what such op
pression means lo tlie American peo
ple we shall examine a district where
SI eel Trust control is absolule, i. c.,
I the Mesaba Range
The writer has before shown "How
the Steel Trust Got It." This deals
With how the trust keeps it. We shall
summarize ith local control of social
and political forces. The part il plays
nationally is well known.
Look first at the federal judge of
this district, Page Morris. Judge
j Morris has denounced from the
bench the range town councils, who
wanted Ihe Steel Trust, to pay proper
j taxes. The judge owns steel slock.
| How he got it has not been explained.
j Next, Bruce McDonald, immigration
inspector at Dululh, in recommending
deportation of George Anderytchlne,
| a striker, said: "He is dangerous be
cause he is smart, having acquired a
remarkable English vocabulary in less
: than three years."
I introduce for the slate—Governor
Burnquist. lie it was who sent the
now famous telegram lo the sheriff,
ordering the arrest of strike leaders
and the taking of them "before magis
trate, preferably at Duluth," where
Burnquist was apparently sure of the
judge. Burnquist it was who gave
sanction to the Importation of an
army of thugs lo over-awe the
strikers.
Next is Sheriff Melnlng of St. Louis
County, who deputized this private
army of the Trust and gave il full
power lo deny constitutional rights of
speech and assembly. These so-called
guards left company grounds to at
tack strikers on the streets and in
their homes. This crew arrested over
six hundred people. District Attorney
Greene is the one who saw that the
victims escaped no penalty he and his
subordinates could fix upon them with
the aid of gunman testimony.
Municipal Judge Carey during the
strike gained the sobriquet of "Old
Ninety Days"—his usual sentence to
strikers. The mayors of the range
towns are the one bright spot. Head-
MINNESOTA MURDER TRIALS BEGINNING
HILTON HEADS COUNSEL FOR LABOR
BY HARRISON GEORGE. SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
Virginia, Minn.. Dec. la. —The open
ing gun in the big cases on Mesaba
Range, will be fired tomorrow when
O. N. Hilton of Denver, famous labor
attorney, goes before Judge Pesler
with a motion to quash the indict
ments against Organizers Scarlett,
Schmidt and Treses,
The only evidence connecting the
organizers to the alleged crime is the
UNION CARDS illegaly seized by the
state with tlie coats of the accused
principals at whose home the killing
occurred and from which their coats
were taken without legal warrant.
The basis of argument on motion to
quash will be this illegal entry and
seizure. In the preliminary hearing
Judge Kesler denied the same motion,
leaving it open, however, for the
present argument. In his dental at
thai time Judge Tesler ruled that as
the coats, although illegally seized,
were not the properly of the or
ganizers, they could not object to the
evidence taken with them.
However, the distinctions between
accessories and principals are re
moved by tin- laws of Minnesota, and
Hilton contends that, as the or
ganizers by law are co-indictees with
the principals, subject to the same
laws as are principals, they have a
common r'ghl of pro'est against cvi
every man tees it an.l knowi what
WOUld happen. The newspapers which

led by Victor power and Mike Boylan,
they exerted every effort to bring
operators and strikers into conference.
The strikers welcomed this, but the
operators refused. These mayors
bave been attacked by the Trust press
and Tower roused the Ire of the Trust
by becoming attorney for the strik
ers. As a consequence he has been
indicted for alleged graft.
The press deserves dishonorable
mention. The Dulutb News-Tribune
has bitterly denounced tlie strike and
verbally damned the strikers, vilify
ing the leaders. There may be a more
degraded daily elsewhere, but the
Tribune holds the laurels for Min
nesota.
The Blwablk, Minn., Times runs a
close second. As an example of what
it means to organize in a Trust town
I quote from the Times anent or
ganizers: "If these men are allowed
freedom of action and speech they
will precipitate another strike. There
is but one way to stop this outrage,
thai is to do as did the citizens of
Everett, 'Wash." Headers will re

shot down five peaceful workers at
Everett November sth. Tlie Times
says an organizer "hates to get the
deserved bat. over the head with a
stout club by a strong man." That
the people should "take the situation
in their own hands, county officers
cannot be depended on. The situation
should be controlled as it is in the
South." Th- Mesaba Ore is the one
local paper taking the side of labor.
As a result its editor, ('. M. Atkinson,
has been indicted on some petty
charge connected with the local ad
ministration.
For the Trust, you may safely ad
vocate lynching and murder. You
may as company gunman shoot
strikers under authority of the county
and with sanction from the state. Yet
if, as striker, you assemble with your
fellows; if, as organizer, you teach
labor its power as did Scarlett,
Schmidt and Tresca; if you stand for
labor in any way. you face the venge
ance of all those forces which reflect
the industrial control of organized
capital. That is why all labor is
watching Minnesota, where the big
battle, now postponed to the 18th, will
soon begin.

if the coats wore their own.
Hilton also says: "If such a doc
j trine of connecting organizers and
even plain union members with a
crime committed by any other mem
ber at any distance. Is allowed to
'stand, no union man is safe from con
viction upon charges of complicity in

I the slightest connection. Organized
Capital can say to any worker, "Look
( here, if you join the union and carry
'a card similar to one carried by an
other person who commits murder at
any place the law will hang you for it,
and you risk your life at my pleasure
•when yon join any union "
Despite the fact that the jury panel
i consists largely of Duluth businei-.s
men, Mr. Hilton appears optimistic as
to the outcome. Hilton reiterates his
former statement as to the Importance
of this trial breaking down Hie Chi
cago Haymarket decision, which he
jsays all eminent lawyers acknowledge
as infamous and a disgrace" to the
jurisdiction that gave it birth An
appeal on an adverse verdict will per
mit a chance to shatter this out
rageous precedent forever, while an
acquittal at trial will be a magnificent
step toward making the Haymarket
decision a dead letter.
