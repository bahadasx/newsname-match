jus stating that Columbus was
I not the live town that it was two
months ago. He said that the
people who had drifted into Co-,
lumbus shortly after the raid of
last March had left and gone to
El Paso. A question we wish to
ask is "Who is this R. D. Gard
ner?" He is a new one to th peo
ple of Columbus. No doubt he
was one of the dead ones who
drifted in and the pressure was
to strong on the part of the men
who look after the peace and dig-,
nity of the town, or else he was
unused to a real live town and
went back to El Paso where the
conditions were more to his taste
and feelings.
Columbus has not as many fly-
by-night artists as it had at one
time, but the places of business
are getting down to an establish
ed order and today there is more
and better indications of a real
and permanently established
town than ever before, and the
little huts and shanties that had
been built during the high tide
have most all bden replaced by
good business buildings, and to
day there is a greater building
activity that ever in the town's
history.

MORE THAN 100 VOTERS
RESIDE IN THE VALLEY
Many were of the ooininn that
ranchers had moved into
town or left country
Doubtless many of the candi
dates for the precinct offices will
be surprised to learn that there
is still one hundred of the voters
of the precinct residing outside
of the town of Columbus. A list
ecentlv prepared of the voters
of the precinct show a much
larger per cent of the residents
of the Lower Mimbres than was
even thought of living on ranch
es and homesteads.
Immediately after the raid a
large part of the farmers moved
into town or left the state, many
of whom have never gone back,
but some have returned, and a
large number remained on their
property.

HADBORNE PURCHASES
THOROUGHBRED BULLS
D. J. Chadborne returned Sun-
lav from Fort Davis, Texas,
where he had gone to purchase
some thoroughbred bulls. He had
four shipped back, which arrived
Wednesday. They are white la
cos and are sure good stuff. He
will soon put them on the range
with his herds.
Mr. Chadborne made the trip
to Fort Davis in his Ford car,
taking his family along with him
who had a short visit in that
section with friends. During the
entire trip he did not have the
least trouble, not even e punc
ture. This seems to be a good
record, in an 800 mile trip.
ELLIOTT PURCHASES THE
COLUMBUS DRUG STORE
R. W. Elliott closed a deal on
Wednesdny of this week for the
Columbus Drug Store, formerly
the Miller Drug Store, from C
R. Rogers, who has conducted
the business since last March.
This is one of the oldest estab
lished stores in Columbus, and
no doubt has been the best pay
ing proposition. Mr. Elliott is
not new in the business at all
nnd will keep the place up to the
usual standard. Mr. Rogers has
not made any plans for the fu
ture, but expects to remain in
town.

RECEIVED BY FUNSTON
Expressed willingness on part of
the Military to help repair
roads damaged by it
Luna County Road Board, re-
turned Wednesday from their
trip to San Antonio, Texas where
they went to interview General
Frederic Funston, in regard to
securing goverment aid in re
pairing the county roads which
have been damaged by the travel
er..te with them in securing aid
from the federal government in
tion caused by the using of the
roads during the rainy season,
The commander did not know
mat suen a rounu aoout roau nau
to be traveled in going from El
Paso to Columbus, and neither
did he know that the trucks were
obliged to use the Luna county
roads.
He informed the board what
stops to take in order to get their
claim before the proper author
ities. They were to see Lieut.
Colonel Farnsworth, base com
mander at Columbus, furnishing
him with all the data, which has
already been done, or is now be
ing done. He will appoint a com
mittee from his corps of engi
neers who will go over the roads
with the board and make their
report, which will be endorsed
by the colonel, and will be sent
through military channels to the
commander of the Southern De
partment, which is General Fun
ston. He will endorse same and
send it on to Washington, mak
ing his recommendations, which
will be favorable, according to
the way he expressed himself to
the board. It should not be so
very long until favorable action
is taken in the matter, as the
road commissioners will use all
means possible to get everything
properly arranged at once.
They have had a meeting with
Colonel Farnsworth, and there
seems to be no reason why the
natter can not be pushed
through immediately.
There is now a large crew of
men working on the piers for the
bridge across Seventy-Six draw
and this job will be completed
shortly after the first of the
year.
