NEVIER CEASES LABOR
Artillery and Trench Warfare Goes on
in Spite of Snow or
Rain on the Battle
fields.
[By William Phillip Simms, United
Press Stat Correspondent.]
[Copyrighted 1916 by United PresB.J
WITH THE BBITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Dec. 15.—This is a machine
war. One realtors this more as win
ter swamps the earth with mud and
wet. The purely human element
balked—but the machines keap war
grinding on. The infantry can't march
—but auto-busses shunt the men
back and forth like magic. The
scouts are almost pa'ralyzed but
aeroplanes defy the elements.
The soldiers can't pass the mud
holes between their line and I he
tr,fuiy and stick to trench work «md
trench mortars all day. So when the
communique reads: "There is noth
ing to report," it doesn't mean the
front is silent—for the machine fight
ing never ceases.
Just now ono of the wettest, chilli
est, dreariest snowfalls on record
seems bent upon ushering in a cor
respondingly soggy winter. Huge
ftakes of snow resembling monstrous
goose feathers and completely arrest
ing aerial operations at times, limit
the vision ,to scaroely a hundred
yards.
But artillery and trench warfare
goes on. Nothing stops this. The
worst possible weather can only
cause a slowing up.
Even wh'en the snow and rain and
fog prevent all attempts at observa
tion, there are always many charted
points against which the artillery
hammers. The trench-mortar men
have the exact range of the enemy
trenches in front. The freezing
weather an^ thaws are very damag
ing to trenches, which have a tend
ency to crumble and cave In. Thus
it is the British Tommy's idea to
keep the martars busy as few pro
jectiles are wasted. Even if thero
are no casualties of the enemy, his
trenches are usually damaged, the
sofe condition of the earth rendering
explosions doubly effective.
Thwugh tne air of aotivity was stop
ped in this part of the line during a
snow storm, yet the fact remains
that the weather seldom completely
suppresses the everlastingly alert
air men. Yesterday It drizzled almost
all day and clouds seemed at times
to be resting in the tree tops. The
day was dark and forbidding. Never
theless, there were many war planes
abroad and at least one German ma
chine was brougnt down in a thrtlling
battle near Arras.
Though tempests of wind, rain and
icy blasts, the airmen got aloft, «top
ping only when it was impossible to
see.

BERLIN, Dec. 15.—Germany ex

negotiations 'because she is now fully
victorious, Katser Wilhelm told Ger

The emperor's statement came aft
ter he had praised the loyalty of
Alsace in peace and war times and
referred to (Rumania as "that country
in the east which attempted to stick
a dagger in our ally's back."
Details of» the kaiser's visit to
Alsace as received here, say the em
peror was in excellent spirits. He
watched a parade of troops while
aeroplanes circled overhead to guard
nlm against possible Frendh raiders.
He talked with officers and told them
incidents of the .Rumanian campaign,
taking no notice of a rain which fell
during the half hour he was in the
open.
"We proposed to mediate to the
enemy," the kaiser was quoted as
saying. "The outcome is unknown,
•but if the war continues, tne blame
lies with the enemy. If they
they have not had enough, then I
know you'll—" and here the kaiser
concluded with a bit of soldier's
slang that caused nls troops to smile
grimly.
