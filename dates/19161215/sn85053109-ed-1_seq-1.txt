London, Dec. 13.—The Associated

an "appeal to the American people"

It follows:

Cruelty Grows More Vivid.
"Th* eloquent protests of the Bel

facts. One must turn to the hi&torj
of the early ages of long past cen

of the Belgians. The Hague régula

rights of the family be respected.' Bui
the German government deliberatelj
