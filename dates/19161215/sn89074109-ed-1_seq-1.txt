The Farmers' Paper
VOLUME 13.
To Vote On Natural
Resources Com
bination Question
The Chamber of Commerce has
been asked to express itself as to
whether or not combinations to
conserve natural resources shall
be permitted. The question of
paticular impotance to consum
ers, producers, and operators is
Submitted through a I refendum
sent by the Chamber of Com
merce of the United States- of
which the Beach Chamber of
Commerce is an affiliated mem
ber. In the canvass now being
made upwards of eight hundred
local and national commercim
bodies will be heard from. The
vote will represent every state in
the Union, our insular posses
sions, and the American chamber
of commerce in the principal
cities abroad
As explained by T. E. Hayward
secretary of the Chamber of Com
merce, is asked to vote for or
against the report of a special
committee of the National Cham
ber which recommends that there
shialil be remedial lgislation to
permit cooperative agreements
under federal supervision in
those industries which involve
primary natural resources- on
condition that the agreements in
fact tend to conserve the resour
ces' to lessen accidents, and to
promote the public interest. The
recommendation is limited to
timber, the ores- and deposits of
useful metals, and of minerals
'which are a source of heat, light
«nd power.
It is argued that there has long
%een need
for
a definite national
policy for the utili.d-n mid
•co? serrvatio of the ratual re
sources to which manufacturers
must look for raw materials or
fuel. Accordingly, a plan is ad
vanced by the committee which
'would make it possible for the
federal Trade Commission to go
beyond its present powers of in
vestigation and to formulate con
structive plans under which an in
dustry may operate to the com
mon benefit of consumers( work
men and producers.
Public Interest First
Consideration
The committee endeavors to
show how the public interest may
be safeguaded and prdtnoted. As
things stands today- it ss said, it
is being left to take care of itsef
There is a strong argument for
the prevention of waste. Statis.
tics are presented which show an
appaling loss. Only about 35 per
cent of the total volume of lumber
as it stands in the forest now
reaches the consumer. Millions
of barrels of oil are lost. Some
thing like 40 per cent of the coal
in the seam is not uti'ixed.
Fatalities Due to Industrial Acci
dents
There is a plea for increased
safety for workmen. Over 4-000
-deaths occur in the metal mining
coa1 mining, and lumber indus
tries each year. In the three in
dustries in question between
three and four men at an average
in every thousand were killed in
1913. In other words, if
a
man
remained in such an industry for
twenty years his chances for be
ing killed during the period
would be almost one in ten.
Both Sides of Question Presented.
This is the seventeenth refer
endum sent by the National
Chamber with the purpose of as­
certaining for the benefit of con
gress and the President, business
opinion prevailing throughout
the country on topics of national
and immediate importance. Fol
lowing the invariable rule the re
ferendum contains arguments for
and against the recommendation
so that organitions may be fu'lv
informed before finaVy casting
their votes. The balloting closes
