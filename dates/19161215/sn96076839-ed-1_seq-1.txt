Christmas
Committee in Charge Announces
Number of Committed for
the Work.
The committee appointed by the city
commission to have general charge of
the Community Christinas observance
has made plans for careful attention to
every part of the work by a competent

The same general plan as wjs used
last year will be followed again. The
tree will be erected on the band stand
opposite the State Bank and a short
program will be given on Saturday
evening, I)cc.3, at 8 o'clock, the lights
of the tree being turned on first at that
time. There will be a small gilt for
each child under ten years of age and
it is rumored that Santa Claus will try
to be present for this part of the pro
gram. The tree will be lighted up every
evening from Saturday to New Year's
live.
The most important part of the work
in collection with this Community
CinO'uniiS celebration is the relief of
the pVor of the city. On and after next
Mondr.y gifts of clothing, canned fruit,
potatoes, toys or cash will be very ac
ceptable for the use of the committee
and may be left at StroebVl Bros, store,
or cash may be handed to the treasurer
of the committee, Kev. John Clemens,
or put into the Christmas boxes left at
the different business places. All
money received will be used for the aid
of the poor as the expenses of the tree,
etc., are cared for by the city.

persons to act on the Committee on Re
lief: Mrs. Chas. Brabant, chairman;

Christmas headquarters will be at the

Famous Lecturer
Coming Monday
Dr. John M. Driver Will Appear
on Entertainment Course.
. The second number of the high school
entertainment course will be a lecture
by Dr. John Merritte Driver of Chicago
one of the most popular lecturers in
lyceum work. It was only by a fortun
ate chance that Dr. Driver was secured
for the local date. Intending to leave
for Europe earjy in tUe fall his foreign
passport was held up by the state de
partment so that all engagements with
the bureaus for this season he was se
cured independently foV this lecture.
Dr. Driver is not a lecturer with a
reputation in printer's ink only. Gov.
W. N. Ferris says of him: "He is the
one lecturer who;-e compensation is
never equal to the service he renders."
Other well known men who have heard
him have spoken highly of his ability.
VV. J. Bryan said, "I take pleasure in
commending J)r. Driver." Leslie M.
Shaw, formerly Secretary of the
Treasury, "I thank you personally for
your splendid address." A Redpath
manager says of him, "We have no
lecturer who gets as many return dates
as Dr. Driver." He has been in every
European country, lias seen all the
kings and armies, tells of great dynas
tic plottings and ambitions and brings
to his audience" a thrilling and instruct
ive message. A great lawyer said of
this lecture: "It is the most compre
hensive and eloquent presentation of
European conditions today, most
fascinatingly told in a, single lecture
in itself a liberal education."
Every progressive, up-to-date, public
spirited man and woman should hear
this lecture. It will begin 'promptly at
8:30, at the Temple Theatre, Monday
evening, Dec. 18. The admission for
adults will be 35 cents, for children 25
cents. The reserved seat board will be
open at Mack's store Friday morning.
There are still five good numbers on
the course and course tickets maybe
secured of members of the senior class,
at Mack's or at the box of fice.x
And Now, Here's Something Else
to Worry About
Investigations by the geological sur

inch in every seven hundred and sixty

GLOWING TALES OF
WESTERN ORCHARDS
ARE FAR-FETCHED
Marketing Problems Greater in
West Today Than in Mich.
. Ludington, Nov. 29. President A. L.
Hopkins opened the morning session
of the Northern Michigan Agricultural
tongress with introduction of Prof. H.
J. Eustace of the M. A. C, stating as
he did so that he thought it well for us
to know something of what people are
doing in other localities. We are prone
to imagine that far fields are greenest
until we are disillusioned by a closer
view. .
Prof. Eustace gave a very interesting
description of conditions in Oregon,
Washington, and Montana as he found
them on a recent trip thru those states,
but it was anything but the glowing
account of the fabulous profits and
harmonious co-operation that , we are
used to bearing of the fruit growers in
the west.
In one region in Washington where
ten years ago there were 50,000 acres
in apples there are now but 23,000.
One reason for this shrinkage is that
many of these orchards were set out by
promoters and sold to people unac
quainted with the business and who
were inJuced to pay 16a fyigh a price
for the land and then compelled to pay
usurious rates of interest.
Many of trees, too, were set out with
the idea -that irrigation would be un
necessary. They grew very well with
out water until large enough to bear
but now have to be irrigated at great
expense.
Western growers have to contend
with all the pests and diseases known
to Michigan growers and many more
Mr. Eustace said that he had never
seen such a scourge of blight on pear
and apple trees as he saw in that sec
tion.
The days of fabulous prices for west
era fruit are past and growers of fancy
fruit in Michigan, many of them, are
getting better prices at home than are
paid for the famous western fruit after
the expense of getting it to a far away
market.
Young orchards, valued a few years
ago at a thousand dollars per acre, have
dropped to six hundred.
The lands generally have been so
starved that the application of a few
pounds of nitrate of soda around a
group of trees has an effect immediate
ly noticeable. v t
Some of the land was no good to be
gin with and thousands of dollars have
been lost thru ignorance of this fact.
Growers of the west must smudge,
must irrigate, must spray seven or eight
times in a season, and in addition must
grade with extreme care with no
market for culls. All this means much
Vdded expense over that borne by
Michigan orchardists.
Around Salem, Oregon, where the
world-famous cherry orchards are, the
brown rot was so bad last year that the
fruit brought next to nothing and not a
cherry was shipped from there this
year. All were sent to the canneries at
a nominal price.
TIiq same story, with slight variations
was repeated at nearly .every point
visited, and Prof. Eustace returned
convinced that the Michigan orchardist
would do well to take care of his trees
and to set out more if he has good land.
He believes that conditions will -grow
worse with the apple growers in the
Monday, Dec.
18 th
t
west and better in thg east.
Near Salem six or seven thousand
acres have been set to prunes and the
promoters of this project will have a
marketing problem on their hands
when these come into bearing.
One of the most promising fruit
prospects was in the Logan-berry vine
yards near Salem. The growers jot this
fruit were having some difficulty in
educating the public to its use, but
when the state went dry a large brew
ery there turned its extensive, equip
ment over to the manufacture of Logan
berry juice. This commodity made a
great hit as a soft drink and both grow
ers and brewers are rejoicing.
A fruit association built , up in Wash
ington by Paul Haven has adopted the
novel plan of carrying $100,000 insur
ance on his life in the fear that some
thing might happen to him and the as
sociation go to pieces. r .
There are great fruit undertakings in
the west, but the expense of carrying
them on is tremendous. The boasted
co-operative associations fight each
other and altogether the prospect was
not one to lure the Michigan fruit
grower from his own orchards.
A CONVERTED SUPERVISOR
When the question of securing a
county agricultural agent was first sub
mitted to the farmers of Mason County
one of the strongest opponents of the
proposition was S. D, Squire, Supervis
or of Sherman township. No smart
guy from the agricultural College could
tell Mason county farmers anything
about farming he said. His vigorous
protests were made to all ,who would
listen and he used the columns of the
Daily News to spread his views over
the county. Supporters of the pro
position came back at Mr. Squire and
the contest went merrily on for several
weeks, or.until the Supervisor made a
business trip to White Cloud in Neway
go county, where his conversion oc
curred.
While waiting for a train to return
home, the Supervisor entered into con
versation with a bystander who ex
plained some changes which had taken
place during the year in the methods
of producing, packing, and marketing
Newaygo-fruit and farm produce. The
men continued their conversation in a
fruit packing shed where the stranger
showed Mr. Squire how the farmers
were profiting by the changes which
he, the stranger, had introduced.
Thoroughly interested by this time,
Mr. Squire inquired who the stranger
was, and was informed that he was
talking with II. B. Blandford, the
county agricultural agent of Newaygo
county.
Unlike some men, Mr. Squire was
open to conviction. He had seen the
light, and he was not ashamed to admit
that he had been wrong in his estima
tion of the value of a county agent. On
returning to Ludington he had printed
a retraction of his views, and he began
to work for the cause with as much
enthusiasm as he had formerly opposed
it. At the present time Mr. R. V. Tan
ner has been county agent in Nason
county for nearly a year and his warm
est friend and supporter is the convert
ed Supervisor.
If Charlevoix county farmers and
business men are not willing to prove
or disprove our nead of a county agent
by giving the plan a trial for one year,
there are twenty-six counties in the
state now employing a man where the
working of the system may be studied.
However, the cost of a county agent for
one year would tax the average farmer
29.7 cents which is 12.5 cents on the
thousand dollars valuation, and this
small amount would barely pay his
car fare to the nearest county. Part
of the state tax which we pay goes to
support county agents in other coun
ties. Isn't it about time we began to
ask for the return of some of this
money for our own benefit? ' This state
pays $000 and the U. S. Dept. of Agri
culture pays $000 to any count employ
ing a county agent.
The good Samaritan didn't wait to be
ntroduced to the man who had fallen
among thieves. .
Knowledge is power and if a man
empties his purse into his head no man
can take it away from him. v
Dying in poverty is dead easy. It's
living in poverty that hurts us.
One woman rarely expresses her
true opinion of another woman until
their children quarrel. '
What some people live on does not
puzzle us nearly so much as why they
live on.
Time is a worker that accomplishes,
much.

VAN PELT'S TOURING DIARY
Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts
October 7, 1916.
We arrived here the morning of the
4th inst, and have been busy ever since
seeing Boston and one day we went to
the Brockton fair. It is supposed to be
really the best fair in the United States.
The day we were there, the attendance
on paid tickets was CG,000, and it sure
ly was a corking good fair.
The best time made at the races was
2:09, and it was not to me one bit more
interesting than our Charlevoix county
fair at East Jordan last month. Speak
ing of fairs reminds me that our fair
there is not patronized as it should be,
as I look at it.
We should show up our big pump
kins, apples, etc., and bring more
people there even if some of us have
to put up some money for special
prizes and attractions.
The weather continues fine,- quite
like summer and the country is beauti
ful to drive through. But Hubert says, .
'Oh, I don't see how the people live
here and make any money, its so rough
and stony." The only thing I could
think of at the moment was that when
our Pilgrim fathers landed here at
Plymouth, they found- it so nigged,
rough and stony that they at once con
cluded it would be a good place to bring
up a hardy race of people and people
who have to work hard we know do not
get into so much mischief as those who
areldle. He replied, "Well, I'd rather
be a little more idle and have more
than to work so hard and have so little.'
So I let him off with telling , him he
could be more idle and work more and
get all there was in it He said he
didn't understand and t said neither
did I.
Yours,
VAN PELT.
