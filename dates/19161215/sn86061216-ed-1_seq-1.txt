"What the entire cltj? and the

the proclamation by the emperor

BRIAND SCOFFS AT
GERMAN PROPOSALS
FRENCH PREMIER'S DENOUNCE
IVIENT WINS APPLAUSE OF
THE DEPUTIES.
Paris, Dec. 14.—premier Briand, ac
companied his denunciation of the
German peace offer as a trap with an
announcement that he would ask for
the increased power with which to
carry on the war, according to full re
ports of his speech before the chamber
of deputies today. At the same time
the premier promised that the govern
ment would not undertake any scheme
of national mobilization such as that
involved in the German home army
plan.
'Evidently," said the premier, "re
cent developments are serious but It
is necessary to recall what has hap
pened in 1916. After eight months it
is not a German but a French victory
which in truth has been inscribed on
French flags." The premier referred
to the French success at Verdun and
the gains made on the Somme and de
rided Germany for its claim of victory
while it was taking such measures as,
what he termed, the militarizing of the
entire population. The chamber ap
plauded unanimously when he affirmed
that the war government of France
would not follow the policy of Ger
many. He asked, however, for power
to regulate all questions concerning
the national defense, including the pos
sibility of requisition but said that if
the latter step was considered neces
sary it would not be carried out incon
siderately. The chamber again ap
plauded when he announced that the
government would ask for the suppres
sion of the liquor traffic throughout
France.
Premier Brand expressed the cer
tainty that some of the measures tak
en by Germany have behind them the
object of intensifying the war next

France to be prepared for these efforts
and to have confidence in the final out
come. Then he turned to a discussion
of the German peace proposal.

connection is understood to include in

Terrible Tales About
Carranza's Men
El Paso, Tex., Dec. 1,4.—The poor of
Guanajuato, one of the large mining
cities of central Mexico, are dying at
the rate of about seventy persons a
day, according to an affidavit sworn to
by an American mining man just out
of there. The affidavit.tfhich has been
forwarded by government officials to
Washington, affirms also that the wom
en teachers in the parochial schools
had been seized by Carranza soldiers
and taken to their camps, while church
properties were turned into bull rings
and barracks.
The document goes on to say that
the poor were wearing native grasses
for clothing and eating roots and twigs
of trees, and corn sent by the Ameri
can Red Cross to relieve this suffering
was seized by officials and sold at
$3.50 gold a bushel.
One church in Guanajuato, accord
ing to this same source, was looted
and a bull flght held in it and it was
then used as a barracks for soldiers
of the Carranza garrison. The wom
en teachers were forced to endure tor
tures worse than death, the affidavit
stated, and were then apportioned
among the soldiers.

WILSON IS DEFIED
ON LITERACY TEST
SENATE PASSES IMMIGRATION
BILL CONTAINING CLAUSE
WILSON OPPOSES.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 14 —The im
migration bill containing the restric
tive literacy test for admission of
aliens which has caused three presi
dents to veto such a measure, was
passed by the senate today 64 to 7.
The bill as amended in the senate now
goes to conference. It passed the
house last session.
The senate reconsidered the clause
designed to exclude anarchists who
teach destruction of property, as a
propaganda. An amendment .by Sen
ator Hardwick for the committee, per
mitting entry of persons who advocate
or teach destruction of property "in
war, Insurrection or revolution" but
not otherwise was adopted.
Three republicans Brandegee, Colt
and Du Pont—and four democrats
Husting, Martene, Phelan and Reed—
voted against the bill. Senators Smith
of South Carolina, Hardwick and
Lodge were appointed on the confer
ence committee.
Authoritative statements have been
made that President Wilson intends
to veto the bill a second time because
of a literacy test. In this event an ef
fort will be made to pass the bill over
the veto, two-thirds majority in each
house being required. The bill pass
ed the bouse last April by a vote of
308 to 87, more than a two-thirds ma
jority, and the senate vote today, If
repeated, would be sufficient to over
ride an executive veto.
FOOD PROBE ORDERED.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 14. —The

committee.
DRY BILL FAVORED.
Washington. D. C., Dec. 14—The pro

universal suffrage amendment was or

JAPAN IS SKEPTICAL
Stock Market Fails After Learning of
Peace Proposal, but Government
Men Are Unmoved.
Toklo, Dec. 14.—News dispatches
from-New York were the first Intima
tion reaching here of Germany's peace
proposal. The news was a complete
surprise and caused a panic on the
stock exchange. Shipping stocks tum
bled and were followed by other secur
ities until the governors ordered the
exchange closed until December 16.
Officials of the Japanese foreign of
fice said today that they do not tako
the German peace proposals seriously.
They expressed belief that the entente
allies would have to fight to the end.
•War Summary
While the warring nations are
awaiting definite developments
from the presentation of peace
proposals by Germany and her
allies the operations on the var
ious fighting fronts are proceed
ing as usual. The immediate fu
ture so far as the peace proffers
are concerned is indicated as like
ly to be taken up by consultations
among the entente powers prelim
inary to the sending of a joint re
ply.
Interest in military develop
ments still centers upon Rumania,
where the armies of Field Mar
shal von Mackensen are fighting
their way forward.m despite the
difficulties of transport caused by
the bad condition of the roads in
a Rumanian winter.
Whether the Rumanians have
succeeded in establishing them
selves along the line of the Buzeu,
near the southern Moldavian bor
der. is not yet apparent. Berlin's
last specific mention In this con
nection was made in last night's
communication in which the Teu
tonic forces were reported to be
nearing the Buzeu. In any event,
it appears that the Rumanian
evacuation of southern Wallachia
is virtually complete, as the Ger
man war office announces that
Great Wallachia south of the Bu
charest-Tchernavoda railway has
been cleared of hostile forces.
Beyond the German report of
the repulse of a French attack
In tlC Argonne. on the western
front and of Serbian assaults on

the war news presents little else
of interest.

COMMITTEE TO
PERFECT PLANS
Farm Improvement Bureau
and County Agent Move
Will Be Discussed
The work accomplished at the open
session for farmers held in the Com
mercial club will be followed up by the
committee in charge of the county
agent project at a meeting to be held
tonight at the club.
Well pleased at the success of Tues
day's luncheon and the enthusiasm
that was manifest by the men from
the country, the committee intends to
continue the work until not only the
160 first set as a goal is reached, but
until hundreds of the men from the
farms become active members of the
Commercial club's farm bureau.
The eighty-four who expressed a de
sire to be a part of a big community
organization at the open meeting fol
ljpving the address by J. W. Coverdale
of Ames, state leader of the county
agent movement, have become verit
able missionaries for the farm bureau
scheme then launched. Many of these
took out blanks to get the names of
their neighbors who were not present
Tuesday. More of them turned in lists
of names of fellow farmers who will
be reached by literature and some if
necessary in person by the committee.
Wants All the Farmers.
The plans for carrying on the work
now under way to a successful comple
tion will be taken up and perfected by
the committee tonight. It is the pur
pose of the committee now that the
movement has been given an Impetus,
to launch a campaign for the enlist
ment of all the farmers obtainable in
th/e ranks of the proposed farm bureau.
If it proves necessary to make per
sonal visits throughout the rural dis
tricts, the committee and the forty or
more volunteer workers among the
ranks of the farmers have decided to
visit the various parts of the county to
get members. All of those whose
names have been submitted will be
sent literature on the project by Mr.
Coverdale.
The date of organization of the farm
bureau will depend upon when the
farmers in sufficient number have been
enlisted. When this is accomplished
officers and directors will be chosen
amon£
the
in the house of represents- fUrbaji members of the club. It will be
ttves without a vote with a salary of the duty of the farm improvement bur-
farmers and not the
eau and not the club generally, to se
lect the county agent and care will be
exercised In making the choice. The
bureau will fix the salary.
The Committee.
The men making up the county
agent committee of the Commercial
club that meets tonisrht in the rooms
of the club are as follows:
C. L. Graham, L. R. Clausen, W. B.
Bonnifield, G. F. Spry, J. K. Dysart, R.

L. Pollard, C. D. Evans, E. N. Stern
er, L. A. Andrew. Secretary J. N. Weld
enfeller and President C. S. Harper,
the latter two being ex-afficio mem
ben of all committees.
Mr. Coverdale before leaving the
city said that the open meeting held
Tuesday was the best organized meet
ing of that kind he had ever attended Hgnts.
and was quite sanguine for the success
of the movement. He volunteered to
be of any service he could to further
the project.
MINES CLOSE AS
