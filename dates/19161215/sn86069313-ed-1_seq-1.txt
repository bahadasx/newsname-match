In the sum of $10,000. Theao threo
cases were vctiued to Grayson coun

for trial.
In tho samo opinion, tho motion
for chango of venue In tho criminal
eases was continued and tho com
monwealth's attorney Instructed to

at the next March term of court.
Tho court indicated that ho
would, under tho law in criminal
cases giving him tho right so to do,
summons a Jury to hear tho criminal
cases from sonio other county other
than Ohio county. As tho motion
for change of venuo In the criminal

to direct that tho venue of thobo
casc3 ho changed.

James A. Everett, of Indlanapolia.
who hi widely known among the
farmers of tho United States as for
mer president of tho farmers organ
izations known as tho American So
ciety of Equity and tho Farmers' So
ciety of Equity, and his son. Sibley
F. Everott, who Is associated with
him In tho publication of fjp-To-Dato
Farming and lu tho ownership of tho
O. K. seed storo, were both found
guilty recently by Judge 'A. B. Ander
son, qj tho United Spates district
court, of using tho mulls lu a scheme
to defraud) and each was sentenced
to a term pf eighteen months In the
federal penitentiary at Atlanta.
An attempt by Sibley Everett to
anvo his father by taking tho princi
pal blarao far sending out a stotoment
through tho mulls which Judge An
derson had denounced as particular
ly fraudulent, brought a decision
from the court to chango his mind
about being less severe on the son
than on tho father nnd they received
equal sentences.
A plea by Frank Oroulugcr, attor
ney for the Evcrctt8, that they occu
pied a high place In tho community
and had u good reputation, brought
tho reply from Judgo Anderson that
men of education who had set them
selves up as advisers to tho farmers
of tho country should receive no more
consideration than n poor man who
had just been sentenced to tho peni
tentiary for embezzling $500 from
tho government.

London, Dec. 13. The German
pcaco proposals made littlo apparent
progress in winning favorable Brit
ish eentiment during tho first twenty
four hours of the unlimited discus
.sion on the subject by tho public and
preys. The general trend of this
discussion continues highly critical,
but there Is soma Indication that tho
llrst Impulse of lrrltutftiii will bo suc
ceeded by a calmer nnd moro conser
vative viow in some inllucntlal polit
ical quarters.
Tho disposition uot hastily to re
fuse to listen to tho proposition is re
flected in tho Westminster Gazette,
usually classod as a Liberal journal
favorablo to former Premier As

peace move calls for a high degree of

Berlin, Dec. 12. Although Chan"
cellor von Bethmanu-Hollwcg did not
discloso tho definite proposals ou
which Germany and her allies ary
prepared to mako pcaco in his
speech before tho Reichstag, such
proposals aro ready and will bo com
municated to the Entente Powers it
tho Chancellor's offer should fall up
on responsive ears. In the corri
dors o'f the Reichstag, whero after
the historic twenty-minute session
tho members gathered in keen dis
cussion of the Chancollor'a speech,
tho general opinion expressed tfas
that the situation would bo advan
tageous to Genuany whether or not
the Chancellors offer was accepted
by tho Entente.
Some of tho opponents of th$
Chancellor arc opposed to any move
In tho direction Of peace except ou
tho basis of "woo to tho conquered."
M.ost Members of the Relschstag,
however, express tho opinion that
the Emperor's decision was wlso
and tlpiely and showed pleasure at
the formal step taken toward ending:
tho wr.
Tho speech was not marked by s
singlo expression of dissent, -whilo
tho significant passages wore erected
with, hearty bravos and cheers. It
was noticeable, however, that Count
von Westarp, tho Conservative lead
er, and others of his following" eat
silent nnd unmoved even when tho
galleries and newspaper men joined
demonstratively In the applause

When the Chancellor had conclud
ed his speech an attempt was made to
forco an immediate debate by tho
annexationist bloc under Maj. Ernest
Basscrmann, leader of U19 National
Liberals, and Count Westarp, sup
ported by the Extremo Socialists.
This move was firmly resisted by tho
leaders of tho moderate parties, who
agreed with the Chancellor that a
general discussion of possible peoco
conditions before tho attitude of tho
enemy Powers was made known could
only lnjuro the causo of pcaco and
placo Germany -at a diplomatic dis
advantage. Their attitudo was that
If tho Central Powers exposed all
their cards before peace negotiations
began they would bo placed at a dis
advantage. Tho indeflnlto adjournment of tho
Reichstag by Its own decision leaves
tho Government a froo hand to con
duct further negotiations and Is re
garded as tantamount to a voto of
confidence.
