Beggars of All Descriptions 1
For the past week or so Clifton has
been overrun with beggars, several jf
whom to all appearances were badly
crippled and who played the sympa
thy gag for all it was worth. Inmost
cases they were successful and reap-
ea a rich reward from the unsuspect
ing philanthropists. All of them
were fakes and many individuals
lossened up considerably after listen
ing to their pitiful plea , for alms.
One- instance of unmerited charity
was witnessed by one of those who
fell for the game. In this case the
man . appeared to be seriously crip
pled, his right hand being useless
and having but very little use of his
legs. After collecting a pocketful of
snekeis he repaired to a bootlegging
joint ana after pouring out a man's
size drink of booze his right hand
came into , play with .no trouble at all.
his legs straightened out and he
dashed down the fiery liquid in ap
proved fashion, all signs of his crip-
piea condition having vanished with
the drink. Another instance 'was of
a fake deaf and dumb man who was
collecting tribute. He braced one of
our prominent citizens and was turn
ed down cold. As the citizen nassed
on the dumb man was heard by a by
stander to remark, "that is the
blankety blank stingiest cuss in Ari
zona." Thus it is that the gullible
public are separated from their hard
earne d simoleums in an unworthy
cause.

it is further ordered that the Clerk
of the Court mail or deliver in person
a copy of this order to each of said
Inspectors, which shall be their author
ity in the premises.

JUDGE DEMANDS
ALL BALLOTS IN
il
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 11. After
Senator Ives had argued in the su
perior court here today that the re
count of ballots .begin immediately
before the ballots from other coun
ties are received,' Judge R. C. Stan
ford stated from the bench that no'
decision would be given by him on a
partial recount and that all of the
ballots must be before him before a
decision is rendered .
He "ordered a recount of the bal
lots in Maricopa county to begin at
9:30, a. m. on Tuesday, giving
Frank E. Curley, attorney for the
governor, 48 hours in which to show
his good faith and dismiss contests
brought against Campbell by him on
behalf of the governor in Mohave
and Navajo counties in. which fraud
was alleged.
Senator Ives said . that . tbfere
would be no charge of fraud brought
and to this Curley assented.
Senator Ives promised to furnish
a bond of $2,000 for costs on be
half of the governor after Judge
Sloan representing Campbell had ob
jected to the bond of $300 as in
sufficient. ,
Counsel for Campbell strenuously
opposed the motion of Ives to begin
the recount at once but were Counsel
contended that the Ballots were in
some cases in custody of the superior
courts of other counties, some in local
contests and in two counties brought
by Frank Curley one of Hunt's coun
sel. -

Campbell Refused His Certificate
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 11, 2 j. m.
When Tom Campbell called today
on Sidney P. Osborn for his certificate
of election the latter refused it, after
having informed the governor-elect
over the telephone that he would be
the first candidate to receive his pa
pers. Osborn's action a taken to
mean that Senator Ives, representing
Governor Hunt, will apply . to the
court for some sort of an order di
rected to Osborn, enjoining him from
issuing the election certificate. It is
evident that the Hunt machine is
working well and that all of the cogs
are well greased. I
Campbell Names Hiizinger to Be His
' Inspector.
PHOENIX, Dec. 11. A recount
of the votes in Maricopa county in
the HuM-Campbell contest will be
gin today, George O. Hiizinger,
named by Tom Campbell, as his in
spector, having arrived from Tucson
with Judge John H. Campbell.
E. S. Clark,, of Prescott, retained
by Tom Campbell as additional coun
sel, also arrived on the scene. Mr.
Campbell has a battery of five attor
neys, with local counsel in nearly
every, county.
Hiizinger Named.
Judge John H. Campbell, counsel
for' Tom Campbell and George C.
Hiizinger, who has been 'appointed
by Mr. Campbell as his representa
tive OH the commission which will
recount the ballots left last night for
Phoenix, Judge Campbell went to
the capital to participate today in
a hearing before Judge R. C. Stan
ford of the Superior Court of Mari
copa, county of a demurrer filed by
Torn! Campbell to Hunt's petition in
which the jurisdiction of the court
to hear a contest is questioned.
It is the contention of counsel for
Mr. Campbell that under the decision
of the Supreme court In the Osborn
case, Which was the suit in which
the Supreme court held that ' state
officers held over. after the first state
election, there can be no legal declar
ation of result and as a contest ifl
predicted on a declaration of result
the statutes are'' incomplete and give
the ..court no jurisdiction of contest
proceedings.
Stanford Reverses Himself
Completely reversing his decision
in me case or uranay vs. Laney, an
action between two democrats, Judge
Stanford held on Saturday afternoon
that Hunt could have a commission
appoitned to recount the ballots in
the entire state even before the is
sues in the case are framed and it
is demonstrated that the contestant's
petition is good and not frivolous.
The ruling forced Mr. Campbell into
court immediately and he had been
compelled to file a demurrer and
answer at once. A hurried consul
tation of his counsel was called for
today to frame the pleadings. The
law gives him ten days to answer.
The court granted Ives' motion
for a recount on a statute which says
that this may be done after suit is
brought. Counsel for Campbell con
tended that the case should at least
be at issue before such action is
taken. Judge Stanford appointed
Thomas Nealson, a local democratic
attorney and a supporter of Hunt as
inspector. This gives Hunt two in
spectors to one for Campbell.
Bad First Impression.
The action of Stanford at the out
set in deciding all points for Hunt,
has been unfortunate in that it has
given the impression right from the
start that the proceedings are to be
partisan.
Campbells attorneys moved on
Saturday to make the complaint of
Hunt, which is in very general terms.

VOTE ON JAN.
FIFTEENTH
B&d Issue of . $160,000.00 Will Be
- Voted on by Taxpayers of the Town
of Clifton on January 15th.
' At 'the regular session of the town
council on Monday night it was decid
ed by the city fathers to call an elec
tion on January 15th for the purpose
of voting on bonding the town in the
earn of $160,000, the money to be used
for improvements, of which the town
is sadly in need The question of car
rying on the said improvements has
been discussed at length for several
months by the city administration, the
only .drawback being the necessary
funds with which to carry on the
work.- After .carefully estimating the
cost of the work, it is thought that the
above sum will ' be adequate for ail
mirnoses. and it is to be honed that
the taxpayers of the town will rise
to the occasion and vote favorably on
the proposition.
" The contemplated ' improvements
are not a luxury but a vital necessity
and have been badly needed for sot
eral years. .They will not only, be
of great and fasting benefit to the peo
ple of today but to the generations to
come. The bonds will be issued for
the purpose of acquiring funds for the
construction and reconstruction of
river walls, -the .construction ' of
bridges and the reconstruction of
roads and highways in the town.
Clifton is assuming metropolitan as
pects rapidly, and while it may never
equal In size the larger cities of Ari
zona, business conditions will con
tinue to be such that without - the
improvements enumerated , .serious
handicap will be suffered by all lines
of industry. Perhaps the most need
ed of all are the two bridges, one
across the river In town in place of
the old one which has served ' its
usefulness and one. directly below the
railroad bridge In South ' Clifton.
Traffic in Clifton has , assumed such
proportions that ; these inprovements
should be of primary consideration.
In years past the present wagon
bridge across the Frisco river was
adequate to the needs of the travel
ing public, but with- the . increased
traffic and the hundreds qf automo
biles in commissiotf daily more than
taxes the efficiency ! of . the present
structure. it is almost a aauy to
pnrronrb' tn aoa atrlncr nf Anton And
vehicles held up at either end of the
bridge awaiting their turn to cross
end thus delaying business to a con
siderable extent. At this point a wide
bridge with side walks on either side
i-3 an absolute necessity and one ol
the crying needs of. the town. The
present structure has been unsafe fo
some time and Its . removal - would,
eventually be but mattej bf a
short time. . -;
The sewerage system -and road con
struction are also badly needed and
wiuh.iutj lavurauie vte 01 taxpay-'-ers
on the question niext month - we
hope to see them become realities. -The
town has no existing indebtedness
and has taxable property amounting ltf
value to $5,829,808,93 and many towns ,
in the conauy of less wealth and Bize
are alive to -their needs and do not
hesitate to bond themselves in order
to leave to posterity the fruits of their
efforts along the line ot civic better-
The bonds are to bear date of Feb
ruary 1, 1917, and are to mature at
the rate of $8,000 a year to and includ
ing the year 1936, and shall bear in
terest at the rate of 6 per cent pay
