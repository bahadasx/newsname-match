Christmas Postoffice Don'ts.
Don't forget to mail your Christmas
packages early. As Christmas falls on
Monday, if you delay mailing till late
in the preceding week, your presents
may be delayed in the rash and con
fusion that is bound to occur because
of the handling and delivery of two
days' mail must be made on Christmas
Day and the addressee may not get his
present until after Christmas.
Don't neglect to inform the post
master or clerks what your package
contains and whether contents are per
ishable or fragile.
Don't send a child on a message with
a package for insurance unless you
instruct them concerning the value and
the contents of the parcel. Both are
necessary before the package can be
insured.
Don/t forget to place your name and
address preceded with the word "From''
plainly on every package you mail—
preferably in the upper left hand corn
er. Postal regulations require this.
If the sender so desires, short imper
sonal inscriptions, such as "Merry
Christmas" Happy New Year" or "Do
not open until Christmas" may be writ
ten on the parcel, but anything writ
ten and placed inside subjects the
parcel to postage at letter rates.
Don't mail tinsel postal cards unless
enclosed in a sealed envelope under a
two-cent stamp. Tinsel cards are un
mailable otherwise and are destroyed.
Don't be afraid to use plenty of stout
wrapping paper and twine. Don't pre
sent a parcel flimsily wrapped "and
poorly tied and ask the clerk whether
or not it will go through. He don't
knOw any more about it than you do.
Don't use Christmas seals to fasten
your packages. It subjects the pack
ages to letter postage.
Don't neglect to insure your valu
able parcels. Parcels not exceeding $5
in value can be insured for 3c not to
exceed $25 for 5c not to exceed $50 ijor
10c not to exceed $100 for 25c.
Ddn't fail to mail your packages early
in tqe day, especially if you reside in
the city. It will be an accommodation
both to the but-of-town shoppers and
the post office force which they will
certainly appreciate.
