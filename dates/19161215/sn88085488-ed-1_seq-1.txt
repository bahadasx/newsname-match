STATE COLLEGE STOCK
BEST IN THE WEST
Cattle, Horses and Sheep from Col.
lege I'm in Take High Hank at
International Livestock Impo
sition, Portland
The Pacific International Live"
Stock exposition is to be to the
Northwest what the "International'
in Chicago is to the Middle' West and
East. Last week the thoughts and
faces of farmers and breeders were'
turned toward Portland. Thousands
came and positively stated that they
could not afford to miss it. There Is
to be found at this show, the best
in the association, Instruction, in
spiration, and business. One could
clearly see that the' future' of live
Btock production in the entire North*
west is bound to be great. Breeders
assembled at the exposition refused
to concede any possibility about it.
They are augmenting their herds, be
cause they have no fear of the future.
The big outstanding feature of the
show was the birth of a new level of
excellence in the live stock exhibited.
The top animals in each ease' were
superlative in form, quality and fin
ish, It is no small honor to be at
the head of the line and receive the
coveted purple and blue ribbons.
Many of the Portland champions will
compete at Denver, Colorado, in I
January, 1917, against the Chicago
champions. Last year the western
bred animals held their own nojtly. j
Citizens of this stale may well be
proud of the high ranking taken by ,
the stock exhibited by their own
State College. A few side lights on
the principal premiums won by them
may be properly presented here.

by F. W. Loomis of Aberdeen, grand
chancellor of the Knights of Pythias
and an able speaker. Mr. Loomis
will take for his subject "The His

taining and convincing and will
bring a message of value to every
man who hears him. whether a lodge
man or not. The local address,

Invitations to attend the address
will be extended to tin members of
all local fraternal organizations and
the heads of the various lodges will
be asked to occupy seats on the i^lai
form with Mr. Loomis.
His lecture is in no sense a Pythian '
lecture, but relates to the origin,
growth and development of the fra
ternal idea from tho very dawn of
history to the present time, and
therefore applies alike to all fra
ternal societies. Tucre would be no
European war today if the principles
of fraternalism had received the same
attention in Europe during the past
quarter century as in this country.
Judge Loomis is a finished orator
and handles his subject in a masterly
style. He clothes his thoughts In
beautiful language and presents them
in a forceful manner. His lecture Is'
interspersed with hits of wit and
humor, making it highly entertaining
as well as Instructive. He should be
heard by everyone. A cordial invita
tion is extended to all.

mittee chairmen emphatically disap

ticed by those aspiring to the posi
tions of leadership in the legislature,
whereby they go about the state
pledging the newly elected members
to their support.
Several Important committees
were appointed for the next conven
tion, to be held in North Yakima.
Miss Sue' Lombard of North Yakima
is chairman of the committee on ar
rangements; Mrs. G. Dowe McQues
ten of Til. oiiea. was made chairman
of the program committee. For
various reasons several new appoint
ments on standing committees were
necessary.
Mrs. Wm. Goodyear of Pullman
was made cha'rman of the pea. com-
mittoo. Mrs. 0. K. Williamson, fed
eration member of the library advis
ory board, was made sub-chairman of
the library extension committee.
Mrs. .1. ii. Graham of North Yakima
was appointed to the food sanitation
committee.
II was decided that a quart
bulletin be published in order to give
wider publicity to the federation
work. All club women will be urged
to subscribe for it.
Tho movement to divide the state
Into district federations was en
dorsed and will be actlyoly pushed.
I. Is thought that by making the dis
trict federation presidents vice presi
dents of the state federation, and the
district committee chairmen members
of similar state committees, the or
ganization will be much more com
plete and effective.
The health committee Is to launch
another "Baby Week" campaign.
Each chairman had much to report
of most excellent work accomplished
ami splendid plans for the future.
The civic committee Is working on the
plan for lb-- "Standardization of the
Towns." The art committee is pre
i paring a book on Washington art.
The food sanitation committee, in co
operation with the Washington State
College, Is to get out a pamphlet on
"Rural Sanitation."
