There Is the Ingenious plea or

"Can't you rent Just one room and
take us to It and call It home?'
Mother Doe Utmost.
The mother couldn't answer "yes."
Iler husband had cruelly treated her
and deserted her. The mother works
steadily, but her pay Is not enough
to bring an offlrm.itlvo answer to
Johnnie's question.
Though thn mother oan't answer
this boy's question, the public of
Washington can.
Tou don't llko pathos? Well, take the
case of tho sturdy boy of fourteen, who
wants nothing more In life than a
rlmnro to be a Rood bricklayer. Ho
demands a chance to "make Rood,
that Is all. nothing tearful or fearful
about II. and he awaits the response
of tho public of Washington to this
ambition.

nies Authenticity of Utilities

SAYS METHODS ARE WRONG
Declares Books Aro Not Kopt to
Show What Existing Physi
cal Costs Are.
The books of the Potomac Klectrlc
Power Company are not Pept with the
Idea of showing existing physical
costs.
The methods of the accountants of
the Public Utilities Commission were
not such In tho beginning as to ellm
Inate all costs but physical.
Tho books of the company could not
possibly show the existing physical
costs and give a basis for reproduc-
Chief Accountant Andrew Sangster,
of the Public Utilities Commission,
states It Is necessary to distinguish
between Intangible and physical costs.
Denies Authenticity..
Hecause of these facts and many
others ho proposes to bring out 'In
the futuie, William K. Hairi. vlco pres
ident and controller of the Potomac
Klectrlc Power Company, on the wit
ness stand today, sard the methods
employed by the commission's ex-'
perts do not show a true valuation of
tlio company's properties in me mean
ing of the public utilities law.
The presentation of Mr. Ham as a
witness by the power company sig
nalizes tno neginning oi me testi
mony as to the accountants and ac
counting systems engaged In the val
uatlon of the physical properties of
the company, which will probably
occup the attention of thn commis
sion until tho latter part of next

Mr. Ham qualified as an expert
by reason of his connection with the
Potomac Klectrlc Power Company
and tha Washington Hallway and
Klectrlc Company as treasurer, con
troller and vice president at various
times since December lhlis.
All Must lie 'Considered.
At the outset of his testimony Mr
Haia stated that he Interpreted the
act of Congress authorizing the valu
ation proceedings to mean that all of
the various Items of valuation of n
pioperty should be taken Into con
sideration. . .
"I believe that the law requires thn
cniitii1loii to arilve at an estimate
of the cost of all porpetty." said Mr.
Ham. "from the beginning of the
time that the property was used.
And I believe that It moans to Include

or more of whisky or one gallon of
beer a month.
This action folio wed a piolonged
and bitter discussion yesterday as to
whether the personal use of liquor

striction on tho amount of liquor
which a person can Import Into tho
District for personal consumption.

sisted on the adoption of II. the bill
would lose considerable support
among Senators.

of withdrawing this provision," said
Senator Sheppard. Hut we can't ac

LONDON. Dec 16. -Acceding to
the request of the United Stutes, H.e
allies have consented to .grant Count
Tarnowskl, newly appointed Auatro
Hungarlan ambassador to Washing
ton, safe conduct to America
Count Tarnowskl was appointed
ambassador to the United States to
succeed Count Dtimba, who returned
to Vienna because he was no longer
psrsona grata to America.
The United Stales made known tts
displeasure at Dumba's actions and
he was recalled, ,
When Tarnowskl wus appointed nls
successor several weeks ago the a!llei
refused him safe conduct first, on
tho ground that his entourage was
entirely too large to bo bona fide, and,
later, because It was contended by tho
ullles that previous experience had
shown Teutonic diplomats were, flrs,t
of all, propagandists or the Herman
powers, and Kuglaud would merely be
aiding hor enemy by permitting
propagandists to travel.
America later made formal requo-U

Since receiving the houid's icceni

abolished the saloon men have been
cogitating on Just what was meunt
by the term.
To a man accustomed to a free
lunch, consisting of a plate of soup
01 a "hot dog" sandwich, u pietzel
would not be so considered.
In inuny establishments the only
hospitality offeicd Is from n bowl on

to Follow.
LONDON, Dec. U. A steady Increase
In sentiment that tho allies In refusing
German peaco plans should set forth
their own terms of peace was manifest
here today.
Notwithstanding the continued Illness
of Premier Lloyd-George, It is known
thst 'the allies, through the foreign of
fice, already have begun nn Informal
excliange of views on von llethmann
Hollweg'a proposals.
Three Views Kntertalnrd.
There are three views cntertalnd as
to the course which the allies should
adopt In answering tho German note,
based on the realization that the en
tente powjers must carefully avoid the
pitfalls of the Teutonic nations. The
three plans are:
First A blunt rejection of the not.
The advocates of this course are con
vinced thst thla will be the only way
In which to prevent tho situation being
maneuvered to advantage by Germany.
Opponents of the plan hold, on the
other hand, that It would bo a serious
mistake not to meet the issues raised
by von Ilethmann-llollweg.
Second That Germany name her
term on the assumption that thes
terms, yet to be made known officially,
may rcall) bo worth considering, and
might b4 considered without damage
to allied prestige.
ThirdThat thn allies do not ask
Germany's terms, but detail theli
own sentiments as to peace; their
terms and conditions. ,
Third Course Fatored.
Suggestions made In the press and
neutral nations, ancL particularly d
velopments of such un Idea In th
United Stales, has aided in develop
ing sentiment for this third course.
Moreover, It Is ittn hy news from
Germany that the government did
not expect a favorable response ol
Its proffer; therefore, Kngland re
gards the main purpose of Von Beth-mann-Hollweg's
proposals as mani
festly two-fold to Impress neutralJ
and the German public.
Advocates of the policy of the al
lies listing their iVrms argue that In
such a situation as presented now
the entente have a "splendid opportun
Ity to put before tho outside world
as well as the people of Germany
whom ihey have always believed gen
erally Ignorant of the real Issues ol
the war a clear-cut, definite, united
pronouncement of the allies' alms and
purposes.
Kxpert To Adopt Course.
There was every Indication today
that the allies will adopt this course.
It Is fully expected that Lloyd
George will be sufflcently recovered
from his Illness on Tuesday to give
In his speech before the House of
Commons a more or less positive
statement of the allies' position.
Ilonar Law's Speech,
In his statement yesterday before
the House of Commons, Bonar Law
said, In part:
"Something has happened of which
I think It necessary that I should sa
a word. Naturally, the papers nrr
full of the peace proposals front Ttei
lln. Until now no proposal haH
reached his majesty's government. It
Is obvious that under these clicum
stances no member of the government
can make any statement on the sub
Ject. and In my view It would b bet
ter that very little should bo said In
the House of Commons.
"There Is one thing which even at
this stage I think it necessary to sa
In moving the last vote of credit tho
late premier, In a peroration which
moved the house and the nation, used
these words: "They (the allies) re
quired that thern should be adequate,
reparation for the past and aclen.ua.tn
security for the future "
"That Is still the policy, still the de.
termination, of his majesty's govern
ment.
Advantages tor Germans.
"Two great advantages are pos
sessed by the Germans. One Is tholi
preparedness for war. They hae to
day another advantage, that is, that
circumstances have so fallen nut thul
the control of all the resources of 0111
enemies are virtually In one hand
One of the drawbacks of our alliance
a. of every alliance, is that It Is ery
difficult to get this central control
To secure It has been the object not
only of this government, but of the
governments of our allies, and ft.
great deal lias been done in tills dltec
Hon during the last year, and partlcu
lolly during the last six months.
"111 my nenet euccenn in nun wnr
and the inpldlty with which we can
bilng It to a victorious conclusion
must depend upon the extent upon
which the icsouicr of the allies In
men, money, and munitions can be
pooled and thrown Into th common
cause."
