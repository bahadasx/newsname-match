In a final effort to reach some definite
conclusion in the mysterious case of
Miss Helen Cannell of Alton, till.,
who died here Thanksgiving day from
burns recieved in an abandoned negro
school house six miles from tbwn,
Frank Smyth, the Cerulean Springs
liveryman who voluntarily made a
statement Monday telling who she
was, was questioned for an hour this
afternoon by County Attorney Smith
and Judge Knight in the presence of
A. H. Cannell, brother of thedeceas
ed.
Nothing really new was learned
and the case remains as puzzling a
mystery after two weeks of investi
gating as at first. Mr. Smi h answer
ed all questions readily and freely; re
peating his statement of Monday that
he had known the woman in SI. Louis
where she operated a small store, and
had sold Tier tobacco. But he reiter
ated that their relations had been of
a purely business nature aud his ac
quaintance was a casual friendship.
He said he could not offer any
theory for her coming to Cerulean to
see him other than it was to secure a,
loan ot iuu. tie sam sne naa never
confided in him as to her business,af
fairs or love affairs, if she had any.
He never saw her show any prefer
ence for one person over another and
that she had always deported herself
in the most ladylike manner." ' On
the trip from Cerulean Springs with
him she talked little and only on
general topics but appeared entirely
rational;
He said that she could not explain
her long walk out the Princeton road
and. going into the school house for
the night and declared that he was as
anxious as anybody to clear "up the
mystery of her death and ready to do
anything in his power.
The body of the woman was ex
humed this afternoon and examined
by her brother, who said there was
no doubt that it is that of his sister.
He plans to leave here tonight with
it for Alton, where it will be buried-

WILSON'S MERCY
FOR "SLACKER"
Court Martial's Imposition of
Drastic Punishment Ap- -proyed
Washington, Deo. 13. Presi
dent Wilson today approved the
actiou of an army court martial
in sentencing Lewis 0. Gardner
of the New Mexico militia to dis
honorable discbarge and a year
in prison at h rd labor, for fail-
are to obey the federal call for
border duty last June but; re
mitted the prison sentence, be
cause the case had been pressed
as a test.
War department officials re
gard the decision as important
because of the warning it gives
to more than 10,000 enrolled
members of the" 'national guard
who have not appeared for
federal service.
Gardner was enrolled as a
member of B company, First in
fantry, New Mexico national
guard. He was one of a consid
erable number who refused to be
mustered into the federal service,
bat tho others changed their
minds when courts martial wer
ordered and joined their co
paniea ratehr than face trial.
Major Blanton Winshlp of the
judge advocate general's depart
ment, was espeoia'ly assigned to
carry on the prosecution before
a court composed of both regu
lars and national guard ofQoers,
t ie Utter from the accused sol
dier's own regiment.
When the case came up for ap
proval Secretary Baker took the
position that Gardner was not
aware of the gravity of his of
fense and as the purpose of the
proceedings had been served by
the conviction, recommended that
the prison sentence bo remitted.
Army tifQcers say the right of
the federal government to en
force service of national guards
men has been well established
and a precodeni set for the treat
ment of future "slackers." The
claim, however, that the fact
that between 10,000 and 15,000
enrolled members of the guards
never have been located for fed
eral service, constitutes a serioUB
impeachment ot the whole na
tional guard system and expect
to have this point fully present
ed to the military committees of
congress, during the present ses
sion,
