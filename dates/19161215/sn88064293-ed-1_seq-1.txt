VOTES IN MORGAN CITY REVIEW
THOUSAND DOLLAR CONTEST
There is no Sex distinction in this Vote Getting tontest,
in which this Paper will Give Away a Ford Touring
tar and Six other Paizes.
Eighteen Contestants are Working Hard
There are mar, y Morgan City citi
zens who have voted for women dur
ing the past ten weeks of Morgan
City Review's great popularity con
test. The ,women have proved them
selves to be excellent vote getters,
and as the contest has just touched
the half way pole, there is going to
be some lively campaigning in the
ten weeks that are left. There will
positively be no extension of the
time set for closing, and all votes
must be in the hands of the contest
manager by midnight of March 1st,
or they will not be counted.
There is one contestant who has
made rapid progress during the past
few weeks, who says that if he wins
the Ford Touring Car, he expects to
operate a service car and that all of
the poople who ffelp him in the con
test may ride free.
Stop and think a moment of the
many pleasures you may have when
you own a car that you cannot now
enjoy. You have wished for an auto
mobile for a long time, but felt that
you could not afford to buy one.
Then why not get in the Review con
test for ten weeks and get a 1917
Model Ford Touring Car absolutely
free of charge. This car which is the

Review Doll and Toy
Fund Closes Dec. 21
The Fond is Still in Need of
Financial Help to Mcke
It a Great Success
The Doll and Toy Fund now totals
$148.75. During the last few weeks
the fund has climbed rapidly and
there is every reason to believe that
the fund will go over the two hun
dred dollar mark. From contributions
coming in almost daily from organi
zations and individuals it looks like
Santa Claus is really going to get all
the assistance he needs in taking care
of the situation in Morgan City.
Even though the Allies were to ac
cept Germany's proposals for peace,
which they have'nt, there would be
no chance of getting any "made in
Germany toys" because the time is
too short therefore the market price
of these necessities at Xmas time will
be as high or higher than ever be
fore.
A stranger in the city yesterday
was commenting upon the Review
Doll and Toy Fund and remarked
that our fuhd was now almost one
tenth of that of the New Orleans
fund in a city sixty times the size.
This does not mean that there is
enough-money in the fund. There
is not. In fact the president of the
King's Daughters prevailed bpon the
Review to change the closing date of
the fund which was originally set as
December 16th, to December 21st.
As she so aptly expressed it, "There
are many who do not get their Xmas
money early, and many others who
do not get the Xmas spirit until just
before the great day." That goes to
show how unselfishly the ladies are
interested in the fund. It is to be
distributed by them a they want
to reach every kiddie in the city
Fifty-one dollars and seventy-five
cents is needed to hit the two hun
dred dollar mark. Send in yours to
day.
All funds contributed to The Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund but contributions will be
accepted by the banks of Morgan
City and by a number of the busi
ness men. Be certain that your name
and the correct amount you contri
bute appear in the colums of this
paper.
