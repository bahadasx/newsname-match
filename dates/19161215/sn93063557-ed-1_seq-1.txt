GAME WARDENS BUSY.
Baron Menzer was arrested by Wardcn
George H. Chaffee December 6 for
trapping 10 muskrats out of senson. Ho
pleaded guilty before A. W. Dickens
and was fined $50 and costs of $0.48.
John Todd was arrested for having four
muskrats out of season. He also
pleaded guilty and was fined $20 and
costs of $6.48, which was paid and both
discharged.
UHIlord Bouvierot iiristol was arrested
is approacliing nu ora ot agricuitural
prospority with farms incroasing in vnlue
and botter motbods of cultivation and
fortilizalion, groater iiiterest inorchnrd
ing, puror bred stock and improved
metliods of marketing.
Hosaid: "It lius ot'ton been snid that
fnrmor.s, becauso of their scattered con
dition nndspii'itof independence, cnnnot
co-operate but 1 think that wo aro prov
ing that tbia is not so. Tho combining
of milk shippers to obtaiu hettor prices
is a notable instanco of refutation of
this notion. Cow testing associations,
in which Vermont lemls, co-oporntive
crcamorit's, fnrmi'rs' olubs, potntogrow
ing associations provo that to bo mde
pondont wo must combine forces." Ho
urged supnort of tlio Grango educa
tional fund, saying that farmers are
learning moro and moro the nood of a
tritined mind to nciiuire success m agn
culturo. "Tho valuo of our fnrms are very
largoly allected by tho condilion of the
roads lending by thein but wo will never
get good roails by kieking to thoso who
have chargo of the work. Wo should
help and encourngo them to do good
work nnd if thoy do not turn them out
nnd put someono elso in their places.
We should stick to tho 'pay as you go'
plan and insist that wo get a dollar's
worth of road for evory dollar ox
pended." Anent tho tempernnco question, ho
said: "Thoro is not much useofasking
for furthor legislation until we enforce
the lnws,wo have. because we have no
gunrantee that better laws will be on-
torced."
Stato Commissioner of Education
Milo B. Ilileiras took ns his tonic, "Tho
Education of tho Villnge and the Rural
Child. He said hc behovcd that a
better understanding of the school
transportation law would remedy tho
present nbuses of it. Hc believed that
no ono is in position to change this law
until it is carefully studied and watched.
The commissioner denrecated the pnrc
tico of disfiguring school houses in en
deavoring to make ropairs that are in
accordance with law nnd called atten
tion to tho imnrovementin thestam'ard
of the teaching force in the State
within a short time.
Of tho rurnl high school problem, he
said: "The condition which makes it
necessaiy for a boy nnd girl to leave
homo in order to have high school nrivi
leges is to be deplored," The nomo
needs the boys nnd girls and they need
thoir homes. One child vout of every
five in Vermont cities are found in the
high school and outside of the cities leas
than one in ten There is need of de
velopment of a high school which can
care for the village boys and girls. A
junior high school, which is now much
favorod by educators, will help to solve
the problem. Mr. Hillegas dwelt at
length upon the character of the work
n junior high schools.
Contests over tho selection of the
officers of the Vermont State Grange
necessitated the continuing of the VVed
nesday morning session into the after
noon for the choice of leaders the cqm
ing year. In the af ternoon, following
the business session, when Master
Willis N. Cady of Middlebury was rc-
elected for the third time, the third
and fourth degrees were exemplified by
tho Kutland Vnlley Orange degree toam.
In the evening the sixth degree was
worked by the State body on a class of
over 200 candidates.
