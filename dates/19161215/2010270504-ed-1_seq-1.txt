Nearly every one is familiar with the above
but did you realize what it meant?
One dollar doesn't mean independence but it does represent the start
toward independence. THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF NORTH
PLATTE proposes to help you to be independent by showing you how easy
it is to save the FIRST DOLLAR by commencieg with a deposit of only
TWO CENTS. Bring your two cents to the bank and let us issue you a
Christmas Savings Club Pass Book. Then make weekly deposit of this
amount adding two cents more each week. By February Nineteenth you
will have $1.10. We will then issue you a regular Savings Department
Pass Book, the deposits in which will draw four per cent interest. If you
take out a book in the Five Cent class and make your deposits regularly you
will have 1.05 by Jan. 22nd. at which time a regular Savings Department
Pass Book will be issued to you.
"ONE DOLLAR" is merely the start.
the stepping stone for more.
If you ever expect to have money in the bank you've 'got to
start sometime why not now?
