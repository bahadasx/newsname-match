'Justice Deyo Hears Sunday Hanting
Caa -Judgs Woira Busy Week
Cases Disposed of New Citizens in
Process of Making.
WAUSEON OHIO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1916
$1.50 PER YEAR
Last Wednesday afternoon Justice
L. H. Deyo moved his court from his
office down to the court room to hear
the case of the State of Ohio vs H. H.
Wolf on a charge of violating the
. State game laws by hunting on Sun
day. The case was brought by A.
F. Sams, Deputy Game and Fish War
den who made affidavit that on Sun-
i day December 3rd he personally
saw H. H. Wolf carrying a gun and
accompanied by two dogs hunting on
the farm of Wm. Nutt in Swan Creek
township.
Prosecutor Chas. T. Stahl repre
sented the State and Attorney George
. Everett of Delta appeared for the de
fendant. Mr. Sams who as we gath
ered from questions and answers from
attorneys and witnesses had started
out on a campaign to put a atop to
Sunday hunting and on the Sunday in
question had rot as far as the home
of Mr. Nutt when he saw a man with
a gun and two dogs going across the
fields of Mr. Nutt's farm he msd
pursuit and called to the man to stop
which that individual failed to do.
Mr. Sams testified that he was at no
time nearer than 20 rods to the party
he was pursuing and that this party
disappeared in the brush and he fail
ed to catch up with him, but he identi
fied Mr. Wolf as the man whom he
had seen hunting on the day and date
in question. Mr. Sams went f"om Mr.
Nutt's place to the home of Art Gill
and there made soma inquiries of Mr.
Gill's son.
Mr. Wolf, placed on the witness
stand gave a detailed accpunt of hit
increments on the Sunday in ques
tion and according, to his testimony,
which was corroborated by Mrs. Wolf,
was not off from his own place ex
cept to take the milk out to the road
and in the afternoon to go with Mrs.
Wolf to call on some neighbors. A
number of witnesses were called by
both sides; both attorneys brought
their forensic powers to bear upon his
Honor. Mr. Everett even went so far
as to recite an incident in his own
experience, when he, sitting quietly in i mav resort to the Christian Science
oiai "uilor c
From the Christian
nel, issue of November 25th, we glean
the following interesting information
in regard to the legal status of the
method of healing practiced by the
Christian Scientists, in the State of
New York. A case involving the heal
ing of disease by the Christian Science
method has recently been decided by
the New York Court of Appeals in
which decision the court held that the
practice of healing disease by prayer
was not a violation of the Statutes
of that State. In the concurring opin
ion of Chief Judge Bartlett of the
above named court, is this statement.
"I concur in Judge Chase'3 construc
tion of the statute. But I would go
farther. I deny the power of the
legislature to make it a crime to treat
disease by prayer." In commenting
on this statement the "Bench and
Bar," a lawyers magazine published in
New York City, gives the following
discussion of the question from a legal
point of view:
This suggestion raises perhaps the
most interesting feature of the case.
Can the attempted cure of disease by
prayer be constitutionally inhibited?
That the treatment of disease so
closely concerns the public health as
to come within the police power of
the state is, of course, too plain for
serious argument. The licensing of
physicians and surgeons is maniestly
a valid police measure. Both operate
directly upon the body. The one ad
ministers drugs; the other wields the
knife. If the doctor knows nothing of
the effect of his medicine upon the
human body, or the surgeon has no
knowledge of anatomy, the results are
likely to be disastrous.. Knowledge
on these points is essential, and the
state has a right to require it,
The case of the Christian Scientist
is radically different. He does not
operate upon the body at all. He
even denies its existence. His theory
is, that disease originates in the mind
and can be cured only by treatment
of the mind! and that even the. men
tal concepts resulting in what is call
ed disease are false and unreal, and
can be dispelled by the apprehension
of truth. A treatment based upon
such theories cannot result in mal
practice upon the body; and to a great
extent the reasons which necessitate
the licensing of the ordinary medical
practicioner disappear. .
There remains, however, the argu
ment from neglect that the patient
his own home reading and smoking
was positively reported as hunting the
rare and rapid rabbit on a farm a
number of miles away. Justice Deyo
concluded that there was not sufficient
evidence to show that Mr. Wolf was
beyond a reasonable doubt, the man
who Mr. Sams saw on the morning of
Sunday December 3rd hunting on the
farm of Mr. Nutt and accordingly dis
charged Mr. Wolf from custody.
This has been a busy week for
Judge Wolf. The Juvenile Court,

i
First Home Game of High School
Team Last Friday Night With
Fayette Team Fast Game Wau
seon Victors Coming Games.
The first game of the season for the
Wauseon High School Basket Ball
Team was played last Friday night at
Saunders Hali when the High School
Team of Fayette were the visitors.
There was a very good audience of
townspeople to witness the battle) and
they were kept interested by the pre
liminary game between the Sophs and
Freshmen of Wauseon high. The
youngsters put up a lively game but
the Freshmen were somewhat out
classed by the Sophomores who claim
ed the victory by a score of 23 to 4.
The Fayette team arrived just after
the close of the first half of the Freshman-Sophomore
game and were ready
for the fray at the conclusion of that
game The Fayette boys averaged
somewhat larger than the boys of the
local team but were a fine set of fel
lows and played good basket ball
though, it took them all of the first
half to get warmed up.
The first fourteen minutes of the
game passed before the Fayette boys
scored; the first half closing with the
score reading 5 to 17 in favor of
Wauseon. Samuel Monetta q Covert
Brothers, Toledo, was the referee and
seemed to give general satisfaction.
In the last half the Wauseon boys
slowed down a trifle while the Fayette
team speeded up and the game closed
with a score of 23 to 13 in favor of
Wauseon. The Wauseon team are
starting out with a fast game whether
or not they will develope the staying
qualities which will enable them to
keep the pace remains to be : seen.
Two other games were scheduled by
the Williams-Fulton Basket Ball Lea
gue for last Friday evening, Mont
pelier vs Stryker at Stryker and
Pioneer vsWest Unity at West Unity,
f'riday evening December 15th and
the next game at home will come one
week later when the Stryker team will
be the visitors.
LOSURE W: R. C. RESOLUTIONS
In the natural course of events
through severe illness and what is
called deajth, Losure Women's Relief
Corps, has in such a short time again
to mourn the loss of another sister
member, Mrs. Ellen Crew, who has
always endeared herself to every one
who was acquainted with her.
Her amiableness was pronounced,
although her face many times had a
sad expression, yet it carried with it
a cherry smile and last a -bnderf ul
amount of good will to her many
mends everywhere.
How much we shall miss her in our
meetings; as she was always ready to

to such a person. His belief that the
seat of the disease is in the body, and
beyond the control of the mind, would
prevent his resorting to it. On the
other hand, if the patient di believe
in the healing power or mind, and dis
believed in material methods, it is
difficult to see how the legislature
would protect him by forbidding the
Christian Scientist to -practice. ' lis
could not then resort to such a prac
titioner, but neither would he apply
to the established school of medicine.
The question raised by Chief Judge
Bartlett seems to us an interesting
one, which is worthy of serious con
sideration. It will not arise in this
state, however, unless the legislature
amends the public health law in the
Casting flowers of purity along her
pathway. But we can not wish to call
her back, when we realize the distress
which she bore with patient fortitude
in her long and painful illness but we
look forward to meeting her in the

AN ANTIQUE
Through the courtesy of Mrs. Mary
Domitio we have had the pleasure oi
perusing an antique curiosity in the
shape of a newspaper published in
Wauseon under date of, October. 5th,
1872. It bears the title of "The Peo
ple's Paper," volume one and num
ber one. From its contents we should
judge that it never got any further
than, "Number One" for its sole pur
pose seems to have been political and
in opposition to the Republican candi
dates for county offices. There is
some interesting reading in this little
four page 8xll sheet but its all
politics of forty-four years ago and
many of those who are the targets for
the political mud which is thrown as
well as those who are held up as mod
els of perfection, for whom it should
be esteemed a high privilege to vote
are alike gone the way of all man
kind. They had their faults and they
had their estimable qualities. None
were so bad that there was no good in
them and none were so good that they
made no errors. They were all hu
man like ourselves.
RESOLUTIONS OF RESPECT
In the death of sister Ellen Crew,
Wauseon Temple No. 337 loses a
highly honored member, a kind and
true friend. While she was not an ac
tive Temple worker, she was ever
ready to do her full share when called
upon. Her gentle loving manner hav
ing endeared her to us all.
While we bow in humble submission
to this sore despensation we offer our
deepest sympathy to the son, bereft
of an indulgent loving mother, and to
the other members of the family in
their hour of sadness.
Therefore be it Resolved. That our
charter be draped for a period of
thirty days; that a copy of this reso-1
lution be spread upon our minutes and
that they be published in our city pa
pers. . Respectfully submitted,

ation in the Cole case. Whether or
not the amendment might constitu
tionally be made, the only justifica
tion for such legislation is the pro
tection of the public health. If that
is not threatened by Christian Science
practice, such practice ought not to
be "forbidden. The legislature of
ten other states, as the opinion in the
Cole case shows, have not believed in
cause of the fact that a great many
people have been so fair - and prompt
in pacing up long standing accounts
that they are entitled to and will have
a higher rating. On the other hand
there are a few who have made no

The Association hopes it will not be

the advantage of being as lively and

splendid memory of past experience
and of faces and persons whom he

know about the author of the poem
published herewith, he will be glad to
tell them for he knew him well. The
poem will appeal to the older resi
dents of Wauseon who may remember
when Wauseon stood "knee deep in
unstoried mud" and yet was, "The
pride and boast of all the West." Our
Glorious Wauseon.
WAUSEON.
Go search the country over,
' From the Mexico line to Maine,
From Baltimore to Oregon,
From Mobile to Champlain;
Each city, town and village
Go view them all and own,
That none- csan hold a candle
Toour glorious Wauseon.
Go search old feudal Europe
In storied grandeur old,
O'er whose battlemented cities, vast
Grim centuries have rolled;
From Lapland to Gibralter
From the Duro to the Don;
Yet nothing there will e'er compare
With glorious Wauseon.
Here stand no mouldering castles,
Gloomy relics of the past;
Nor minret spire, nor dome arise
O'er ponderous structure vast;
Nor aught of regal grandeur here,
. Where splendid and alone,
Sublimely o'er a mud-hole stands
Our glorious Wauseon.
She boasts not of historic fame,
Of battle, siege and sack
With streets once red with gory
streams
'Mid smouldering ruins black;
Her streets ne'er flowed knee-deep in
blood,
No carnage here was done;
But knee-deep in unstoried mud,
Stands peaceful Wauseon.
When down beside the old Maumee,
"Mad Anthony's" thunder roared,
in furious tight along that shore,
Against the savage horde,
And when Tecumseh raised his arm
That selfsame shore upon
The oak trees waved their branches
o'er
Unconscious Wauseon.
For then the woodmen's ringing axe,
Had waked no echoes here;
Within the forest lurked the wolf,
And coursed the bounding deer;
And dusky warriors roamed the wilds
:That hid the coming dawn
Of future greatness,, sleeping, with ...
ihe site of "Wauseon.
But years, long years, have fleeted
past,
The Red man's star is dim;
His glory and his race alike,
Have faded as a dream;
And here within his hunting grounds,
Like Jonah's gourd, has grown,
The pride and boast of all the West,
Our glorious Wauseon.
So here's all hail to Wauseon,
All hail her people, too.
Who through old Clinton's realms of
mud
Their boots to glory drew;
A health to each, a health to all;
A health to everyone!
And last of all a double health
To glorious Wauseon.

ELLEN LILLICH CREW
Ellen Jane, daughter of John and
Sarah Lillich, was born about three
miles south of Wauseon, Ohio, No
vember 18, 1843, and died in Wauseon
Ohio, December 8, 1916, aged seventy
three years and twenty days. She
was one of a. family of nine children
seven sisters and two brothers, all of
whom are dead except Mrs. Joanne
Moses, of Alvordton, Ohio.
On January 1, 1870, she was united
in marriage to Micajab Crew of Wau
seon, Ohio. One child, a son, glad
dened their hearts and gave them
something worth while to live for.
With this son, Alva, she made her
home during the last eleven years of
her life. The remainder of her mar
ried life was lived on their farm
about six miles south east of here.
Her seed has not been greatly
multiplied. As there was but one child
so also there is but one grandchild,
Mrs. Walter Disbrow, also of Wau
seon, Ohio.
Mrs. Crew was a Pythian Sister and
also an enthusiastic member of the
Women's Relief Xorps. Many sick
hearts were cheered and sad hearts
relieved by her sacred ministries.
Almost half a century ago she unit
ed with the Olive Branch U. B. church
and worked and worshipped therein
until in quite recent years she trans
ferred to the Methodist church . of
Wauseon.
She bore her long and violent suf
fering with great fortitude and pa
tience and left her testimony behind
of being both ready and willing to
go in God's good time and way. We
have no doubt she is now beyond the
reach of pain and safe at home.
Folks in all direction keep saying
"a good woman is gone." Let them
have it so, the tribute has been well
earned.
Funeral services conducted by her
pastor, Rev. O. P. Hoffman were .held
at the home of her son, Mr. Alva
Crew, Monday afternoon, December
11th at 1:30. Interment made in
Wauseon cemetery.

Another of Wauseon's older and
highly honored residents passed away
last .Sunday. , Mrs. Hough was highly
regarded by all who knew her and
her life was so interwoven in the
life and development of our commun
ity that her departure brings a real
sense of loss to those that have known
and loved her through the years.
For a number of years she has been
in poor health and for the past two
years or more an invalid, during
which time she has been tenderly car
ed for by her daughter, Miss Lillian
Hough.
Elmina C. Hough, eldest daughter
of Amos Hosmer and. Rebecca Live

county, Michigan, December 12th,
1837, and died at her home in Wau
seon, December 10th, 1916, lacking
two days of being seventy-nine years
of age.
She was united in marriage with
Charles Richard Hough, February

having lived together more than fifty
one years.
