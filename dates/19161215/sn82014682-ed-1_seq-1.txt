PEACE STILL REMOTE,
SAYS JAPANESE EDITOR
"Germany most do something to
satisfy the citizens of that country
who .vant to end the war," said Y.
Soga, editor of the Nippu Jiji, today.
At the present time there are a num
ber of Socialists v,co are agitating
that the war be 'ended.-; Now Germany
has asked for peace proposals, and
if the Allies do not agree, Germany
win have stimulated the people.
"Peace is still remote.- It is the
belief tf many . that Germany is
merely sounding the Allies to find
out their status. England and France
have prepared new foundations which
will make them stronger from now on.
Tsingtau will not be given back to
Germauy, as Japan will hardly agree
to this i lan."

BOARD PLANS TO
STOP ALL ERRORS
Hereaiter thi memLers of the board
of supervisors will go more fully into
the plans and specifications of street

is evidenced by. the action of the
board at its last meeting when it voted
to consider the proposed Puunul pro

Since then a number of the mem
bers have stated that the same pro

future jrojects. This takes it out
of the hands of the road committee
to som extent.

by Supervisor i.arsen at the last meet

which the city will l ave to pay; and
which ho laid to the engineer's depart

The n'stake v hicli reulted in the
loss of approximately $16,000 was in
connection with the Manoa improve
ment district and is divided into two
parts. The first, amounting to $6500,
was caused when the estimates were
made up. The econd Is due to an
overstsntin the plans of storm drains
which were so run that in times of a
heavy rain and. a resulting freshet, the
grounds of the Mid-Pacific Institute
will be flooded. To remedy this drain
pipes '.'til have to be extended, cost
