GeltiiiK Views of Governments
for Use by Lloyd George
in Mis Speech.
LONDON. Dec. ir. -Notwithstanding
tho continued llluoi of Premier Lloyd
(Jeorgo tho allies, through tlm Foreign
Office, have already begun an Informal
exchange of views on von Ilethmann-
llollweg's proposals,
Three views aro entortalnml a.s to the
course which the allies should adopt
in answering the. (Icrmnn note.
First A blunt rejection of th
note. Tho advocates of this
course are convinced that this
will bo the only way in which to
prevent the situation bslnri ma
noeuvred to her own advantage by
Germany, Opponents of tho plan
hold that it would be a serious
mistake not to meet the issues
raited by von Bethmonn-Holl-werj.
8econd That Germany name
her terms on the assumption that
these terms may really be worth
eontiderinti and mioht be con
sidered without damauo to allied
prestige.
Third Thnt the allies do not
ask Germany's terms, but detail
their own sentiments as to peace,
their terms and conditions.
There uern many Indications to
day that tho Allien will adopt this
euiirnu.

DEPENDS UPON A
TAKEN BY ENTENTE ALLIES
Embassy Officials in Washington
Give Out a Statement Declaring
Germany Is Willing to Discuss
Disarmament If Conference IsHeld
WANTS TO LIMIT NAVIES ,
AS WELL AS THE ARMIES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15. President Wilson probably will not
finally determine on any formal steps in connection with the peace pro-
I pos.ils of the Central Powers until
Prime Minister, has spoken in (lie House of Commons Tuesday. ,
Through the American diplomatic representatives in the capitals of
the liiiteulc powers the American Government will keep in close touch
wilii (lie situation. ;
Secretary Lansing to-day held his lirst conference with President
Wilson since tlie peace proposals were announced. The Secretary
said later the position of the American Government had not been
finally determined and that the note from Turkey had not been received.
There were indications that while the President was still waiting
for an expression of the attitude of tlie I-nteiile allies before taking
any formal step, lie had made up his mind sulliciently on his general
policy to discuss it witli the Cabinet.
Tlie Ofriiinii llmbnss) anlliurlzi-s the sinlcim'itt that n nf thn
must Important subjects tr hMm-iissIdii lit the proposed IIul-uo con- .
Terence of belligerents vmiilil be Unit of limited uuhcrsul disarmament.
The iiuestlon of limiting nrmnmonts ?-
crushing "Prussian militarism tno
allies have called It wus regarded us
ili. iTe.-itiHt obstacle In pence, none
of the nllle.1 capitals bollevlng tier-
many would consent to It unless
beaten to her knees. Tho uulhml7-.e.l
statement that site wishes It consid
ered In pou.cn parloys came, therefore,
as a surprise to diplomats.
C.ermany's disarmament proposals
mean that Hussla must be restrained
from using her full land power: F.ng-
land from using lu-r mil sea power.
The statement at the Gorman
Embassy attracted widespread
attention amonfi Government of-
ficials and diplomats. It was ac
counted doubly interesting- be
cause Germany had repeatedly
refused such sunoestions, even to
the point, it was said, of threaten
inn to withdraw from the second
H.icjuo conference if the subject
were pressed.
Since tin. PJ07 conference the sub
ject has been widely discussed un
olllclally. (Jreat Ilrltaln offered u
naval holiday to (lormany without
success, and President Tuft waa au
thorized by CongteMM to appoint an
itit.-i iiiillonal commission. The lust
f..MKuH also In tli Naval Hill au
tlioi Izi il the appointment of .m Am.-i -it-.
111 lepiescntaliuii to an interna
tional meeting.
More of the neutral European
diplomats have asked their Gov
ernments to authorize them to as
sure President Wilson of support
in any movo designed to brinn
about consideration of the offer
to discuss peace.
Nuutrul dlsplum.its am certain that
