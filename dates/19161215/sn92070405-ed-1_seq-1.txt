Un the 27th of this month George
W Uanncr, first mayor of Lords
burg will be united in marriage to
Mrs. May Bartlett, also of this city.
Word of the union came as a delight
ful surprise to the host of friends of
both parties who arc well known
throughout this section. The mar-
r Hugo will take place at the homo of
the groom and after the first of the
year they will bo at home to their
many friends.
Messrs Bishop and Paul of Douglas
Arte., were visitors here the first of
the week in the interest of a Douglas
smeltery and consulting local mine
operators. Both gcntlomen are well
known throughout the southwest
where they havo been prominently
identified with mining and smelting
for a number of years and have
transacted much business in the
Lordsburg mining districts.
The high grade silicious ores of
this district arc in great demand at
both the Douglas and El Paso smelt
ers for flux and even Clarksdale has
participated in the local output. At
the present time, however, there
seems to be a great demand especially
at Douglas, Ariz. The Lordsburg
ore with its good metal rnd high si
licious contents is desired for both
flux and converter lining, ou: mors
especially the former. During thec
periods of damand nt the smelters
many of the low-grade ores of the
camp may he mined and shipped at
a neat profit and :t is quite likely
that the present desire for l.ical oreá

The 85 Mining Company has
decided on the sinking of their
main shaft until the 950 foot
level has been reached, prosecut
lateral work at the various levels.
The improvements for the com
ing year as contemplated, are
to build a few small family
houses and a hotel for single
men. This building includes the
installation of a sewerage system
with a septic tank, in this way
it is hoped to have every out-of-door
toilet done away with. One

dealer for the Willys .Overland coin
puny, retuvwd Sunday from a trip
to the company'i factory at Toledo
where he vine with a irtierh 0i
southwestern dealers. In an inter
view with !. I.ini-il renreeentati.H
Mr. Fitzpatrh!: said-
"Nothing was uyor o impressw
as our tour of the great plant that
turns out Willys-Oorland cam.
Our Pullmans all parked in the
company yards. Then was room u
nough, for there ave stavon nnd three
qunrter miles of track within the
plant. Each man got a card con
tamine; a picture of Mr. Willys and
an autographed snesng.2 of welcome
from him. Next thing I knew wo
were lined up on the stops of the
stunning new ndmiuistratic i build
ing Retting photographed. Elovnt
ors shot us to tho company's own
restaurant on the sixth floor. There
we had a corking breakfatt. At eaeh
pinte there was a copy of th3 live
"The Starter". It mapped our day's
program. Then started our tour of
tho plant. Our guides were caroful
ly picked men. They knew the plant
from end to end, and tho parties
were small so that each member of
the party could 'lave his question
answered. Nobody ought U try to
sell Willys-Overland product .with
out knowing this plant. You can't
grip the immensity of th? propositio i
till you do. It is no pikor bus
iness. 388 persons can be fed in the
restaurant at one time. Hut this is
nothing to what hita when you cross
into the shops. I; is a wh'rl of ac
tion, yet all is system. Parts by the
untold thousands are here, with a
value into the milions of dollars.
There are milions of motors. I never
saw so many crank shafts together.
Our guide said 0,000 I'd have be
lieved 00,000. Thre is stock in
bins, stock in yards, stock along Uie
walls, connecting rods, frames, fend
ers, mudguards, hoods, rims, springs,
axles, torsion tubes, transmission
gears, shafts, break parts, stcoring
rods, pedals it is an unending
procession. $25,000.000 ar etied up
in land, buildings and machinery,
not to say a word about tho stock
of parts and raw material. From
the roof of the wonderful administra
tion building, which stands out like
a stat capital, you got a gicat pan
orama of the plant. You an then
readily believe that it occupies 103
acres, with 4,48G,G80 square feet of
floor space in daily use and n produc
tion capacity of 1000 cars per day.
You can appreciate tho growth
from 250 employes in 1008 to 17,300
in 1910. 1,000 per.iom, more than
the entire manufacturing force of
many a company, work in the ad
ministration building alone. This
structure, 375 feet long, has every
facility for rapid work, including dic
taphonos, its own telegraph and vel
cphone system and a m.:il handling,
department that does everything but
write the lettors."
