German Proposals.
THREE PATHS OPEN

-ny United Press
LONDON, Dec. 15.-rA steady la
crease In sentiment that the Allies, in
rejecting Germany's peace" proposals
should set forth their own -terms of
peace, was manifested eVe today.
'Notwithstanding the continued illness
of Lloyd-George. It is, known that the
Allies, through the foreign office, have
already begun Informal exchange ot
views on Bethmann-Hollweg's proi
posals. u i .
There are three views intended as
the ultimate course which the' Allien
should adopt in answering the notes,
based on the realization that the En
tente Powers must carefnlly; avoid the
pitfalls of the Teutonic nations. These
plans are: ti
First, a blunt rejection, ot the note's;
Second, that Germany's 'terms, jFet
to be made known officiary may really
be worth considering and may.be con
sidered without damage to the Allied
prestige, p -, ,. f . I
Thhvi that 'ti AnieaiUtj not iii
Cernaanys ternk buUetMl the.ro
sentiment as to peace, tbelr terms and"
conditions.
Suggestions made in the press ot
neutral nations and particularly de
velopments of such an idea in the
United States, have aided in develop
ing sentiment tor the third course.
Moreover, it is seen by news from Ger
many that the government would not
expect a favorable response. Eng
land, therefore,,,' regards the main
purpose of the proposals as manifest
ly' v twofold to Jmpres neutrals and
the German people- , -
Advocates ot the policy of the Al
lies' listing their terms argue that in
such a situation as the present the'
Entente Powers have a splendid op
portunity to put before the world, .as
veil as the people ot Germany, a
clear-cut, definite, united pronounce
ment of the Allies aims and purpos
es. There was every indication today
tthat the Allies will adopt this course.

The Columbia Automobile Club will
meet for the first time In two years

Little Girl Tells Store's St Nick"
She Wants Shoes.
A little girl, 3 years old, walked
three miles Wednesday to see Santa
Claus, who was ,at the Missouri Store,
to tell him she wanted a pair of shoes.
The child had been told that if she
would go to see Santa he would give
her a pair of shoes; so with just light
rubbers and gaiters on her feet she
reached the store nearly frozen. She
was taken in and warmed; Santa took
her name, and she will get her new
shoes' for Christmas.
Nearly three hundred children be
tween 3 and 4 years, and almost as
many between 6 and 15, came to see
Santa and to talk to him over the tele
phone. -A telephone was placed on the
outside of the Missouri Store and one
In the window, and by this means the
children could talk to Santa. tele
grams were sent to all the Columbia
schools telling- the teachers and chil
dren that Santa Claus was here and
wished to talk to them.
Two big books containing the names
ot all good boys and girls of Columbia
were used for reference when the chil
dren told Santa, what they wanted for
Christmas. Almost every child told
the good "St Nick" to remember his
or her mamma or papa. Boy Scout
books were requested by a greater
number of boys, while the girls mostly
desired sleds.
The little tots were very business
like in talking over the telephone. One
little boy, fearing Santa would forget
something for him, talked three times.
The children stood around on the out
side of the store and discussed the re
alty ot Santa Claus.

TO DELIVER SUNDAY
Five Wagons to Carry Par
cels on December 24, but
No Letters.
The Columbia postoffice last week
handled the heaviest mail that has
ever passed through It In one week.
A large part of it was anti-tuberculosis
literature. The receipts at the
postoffice for the first twelve days of
December were $4,000, which Is a
larger amount than has ever been re
ceived in an equal period.
December 20 is the day on which the
annual Christmas rush at the postof
fice Is expected to begin. From then
until several days after Christmas all
the regular employes at the postoffice
will work from two to five, hours over
time each day. Six substitutes will'

period.
Tables and scales will be placed in
the postoffice lobby during the rush
period to facilitate the handling of the
increased business, Postmaster J. H.

On December 24, for the first time
since the local postoffice was estab

bulky packages on that day, but no
letters will be distributed by carriers.
The Sunday delivery is imperative be
cause it would be impossible to de

COLD WEATHER STRIKES NEEDY
Requests for-Old CloUrep and Greer
ies Have Increased. 7
The cold, weather has increased
largely the demand for old clothes and
coal among the poor ot the city. Dur
ing the last few days on the average
ten persons daily have visited the of
fice of D. E. Major, field agent of the
Columbia Charity Organization Socie
ty, in search of old clothes and, in a
few cases .of coal and groceries.
Mr. Major is well satisfied with the
generous amount of old clothes con
tributed by the people of Columbia.
Therevis, however, a shortage of chil
dren's clothes, especially shoes. The
neSf for shoes by one boy but 14
years' old who visited the office-was so
urgent that Mr. Major 'found it neces
sary to buy a pair of new shoes imme
diately. , .
Contributions of old clothes -are
made through. the merchants' delivery.
'which collects, the donations at the

A few loads of coal are'' sent out
daily, and the continuance of the cold
