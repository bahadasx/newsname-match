lowing account of the flood in these
parts.
"Pendletonians had on their hands
on the 14th of December, 1882, a full
grown flood. It came as the result
of two days of heavy rainfall, accom
panled by warm winds which melted
the snow In the Blue mountains.
"So suddenly did the Umatilla river
rise that many citizens of the town
had to climb trees to escape from the
torrent. Among the structures wash
ed away were the sawmill of J. H.
Sharon & Co.. and the residence ot
Senator Pennington. Two bridges
were carried down by the flood, an 1
the O. Ft & N. tracks were washed ou!
In many places. i
"Circuit court was in session in
Pendleton during this time, there be.
ing a very heavy attendance; this
added greatly to the trouble in find
ing places for the homeless to llv
until the waters subsided.
"At Echo the flood did a great
amount of damage.
"There had also been very heavy
rains In the Willamette valley; rail
road traffic was held up, highway
transformed into quagmires and tele
graph wires were down In almost
every direction."
