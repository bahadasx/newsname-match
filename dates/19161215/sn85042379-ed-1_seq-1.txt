NEW BANK WILL
SOON BE OPEN
_
EXPECT TO ERECT BUILDING
Farmers - Stockbrokers Bank
Newest Local Enterprise
Will Be Ready for Business About
January First. Temporary Lo
cation in Odd Fellow Bldg.
About the first of January, or as
Boon thereafter as adequate quartern
can be secured, the Farmers-Stock
growers Bank of Glasgow, will open
for business.
The incorporators of the new bank
are all local men, and they have
everything ready to begin doing a
general banking business, the minute
the equipment arrives, and a suitable
building can be obtained.
Several sites are being considered
for a temporary location of the bank,
but none have been definitely decided
upon. It is the intention of the men
behind the organization of the new
bank, to build a structure that will
house the bank, and for other pur
poses, in case they cannot secure a
suitable place.
The capital of the new bank is
placed at $35,000, and a charter has
been granted so that business can be
started at any time.
The officers are: R. E. Johnson, pres
ident, and G. R. Jamieson, vice presi
dent. Several men are being consid
ered to fill the position of cashier,
but none have been decided on as yet.
The Board of Directors are: M. Mur
ray, Roy Billingsley, T. IL Shipstead
Scobey, Roy Black of Hinsdale, R. E.
Johnson and G. R. Jamieson.
The rapid growth of the city and
the development of the resources of
the surrounding country has made it
possible for another banking institu
tion to enter the field. The men who
have organized the new institution
have taken an active part in building
up the city and this part of the state,
and they realize that the city is des
tined to have a remarkable growth
within the next five years.
Mr. R. E. Johnson, the president
of the new bank, is the present head
of the Johnson Farm Loan Co., which
has been very successful in its field.
He is familiar with every aspect of
the country and understands the loan
business thoroughly, and has the con
fidence of everyone who knows him.
His associates, G. R. Jamieson and
M. Murray are prominent residents
of this city. Both are engaged in
the sheep business and have been very
successful in their ventures. Roy
Billingsley of this city, T. H. Ship
stead of Scobey and Roy Black of
Hinsdale are stockmen and ranchers
of wealth and influence, and their as
sociation with the new enterprise will
have a big influence in getting cus
tomers.
MALTA TO OPEN
SEASON HERE
First Basketball Game Next
Thursday Night. Teams
Well Matched
"With Malta as their first opponents,
the Glasgow H. S. quintet will begin
the basketball season Thursday. The
little affair will be threshed out on
the local high school gym floor, and
it promises to be quite a time of
mourning for someone. Malta is re
ported to be much stronger this year
than last, and has hopes of revenge
for the drubbing they received last
year here. Glasgow's team also bids
fair to be better than last year, when
they came withone one game, their
only defeat, of winning the champion
ship of northeastern Montana.
Supt. Williams is making the final
arrangements on a schedule that
makes those of former years sound
like play. The dates are not all def
initely determined yet, but Glasgow
will have at least five, and possibly
six, home games, with return games
at the other schools. Besides Malta,
Williston, Culbertson, Chinook, and
Havre will play here for certain, and
there is a strong possibility that Fort
Benton or some other fast team will
also be seen. Glasgow plays at Cul
bertson and Williston during the
Christmas vacation. The remainder
of the schedule will be published as
soon as possible.
games will be tried out this year.
Season tickets will be sold at the nom
inal price of $1.50, good for five ad
missions at any time the owner sees
fit. Five persons may come to one
game, or one person to five games,
or any other combination desired as
long as there are unpunched numbers
on the ticket. As the single admis
sion to all games will be 50 cents, the
season ticket will offer a substantial
saving. This scheme will also make
it unnecessary to canvass the city!
with tickets before each game, as has
been the custom heretofore.
The High School Athletic associa
tion will, quite naturally, appreciate
a heavy sale of season tickets. They
promise all purchasers their money's
worth of fast basketball.
The lineup for the Malta game is
not settled as yet, Coach Leedham
says. He considers that the most
promising first string candidates are
Heiland, Baer, and Illman for the
forward position; Lebert, Pippenger,
and Richardson, guards; Wall, center.
Sektnan, the big center of the scrubs,
has been a hard proposition for the
first team to handle in practice, and
only lack of experience keeps him
from being a serious contender for
Wall's job.
The combination to start against
Malta will be selected from the above
group, with a probability that the
others will be also tried out before
the game is over. Some of the
scrubs will also be on hand to break
into the game if the opportunity pre
sents itself.
CAR SHORTAGE
The car shortage during the past
several months has caused railroads
and everybody else no end of delay
and trouble. An investigation of the
matter by government and state com
missions found that the dilatoriness
of firms, receiving car shipments, in
unloading cars and the laxness of the
railroads in charging and collecting
demurrage had a whole lot to do with
the matter.
In consequence a new and more se
vere rate of demurrage will be put
into effect on December 15th and col
lection of same will be enforced. The
{old rate was one dollar per day for
each day's demurrage.
The new rates are :
For first day, $2.
For second day, $!!.
For third day and each succeeding
day, $5.
It is expected that the new rates
will cause the expeditious unloading
and return of cars of all descriptions
which will in time relieve the car
shortage situation considerably.
Railroad men declare that numer
ous instances have occurred where
cars have been held for fifteen days
waiting unloading, the cars being
used for storage purposes. All this
will be changed when the new rates
go into effect, it is expected.
-NEW ELEVATOR OPEN
The new Equity elevator is now
open and ready for business. Grain
has already been received at the new
place, and it is one of the largest and
best equipped in this part of the state.
It has a capacity of 35,000 bushels
and can elevate, clean and load 1,500
bushels of grain an hour.
F. W. Feehan recently came up
from Nashua to take charge of the
elevator, and W. M. Burlingame will
have charge of other Equity business
in the city.
Coal sheds and storehouses are also
to be erected here by the society.
CHRISTMAS CANTATA
At the Methodist Church on Sun
day evening, December 24th, there
will be no preaching service, but the
evening hour will be given^over en
tirely to the choir, which will render
a beautiful Christmas cantata en
titled, "The Messiah's Advent." This
cantata contains a wonderful selection
of the best in music and song for the
Christmas time. Keep the date in
mind.
CRUSHED UNDER WAGON
Adrian Pepin, a homesteader south
of Malta, lost his life Tuesday when
he was crushed under the wheels of
the wagon he was driving. He was
on his way to Malta, and while driv
ing down a steep hill, a barrel on
which he was sitting lolled over and
threw him under the horses and
wheels. The team ran away and the
wheels passed over his chest, causing
almost instant death.

POSTAL RATES
TO BE REVISED
Zone System Provided for Mag
azines and Newspapers. Hits
Catalogue Houses
One-cent postage for local first
class mail deliveries and a zone sys
tem of rates for second-class matter
which is expected greatly to increase
the charges for magazines and other
periodicals having a nation-wide cir
culation, are provided for in the an
nual postoffice appropriation bill as
virtually completed today in commit
tee.
• The measure, carrying appropria
tions totalling about $317,000,000
probably will be reported to the house
next week.
The zone proposal for handling
newspapers and magazines, which
now pay a flat rate of one cent a
. .
pound, is regarded as one of the most,
radical changes in postage rates in
years. It divides the country into
eight zones, with rates chargeable
ranging from one cent for three hun-j
dred miles to six cents of 1800 miles
or more. The bulk of daily newspa
pers, the committee believes will not
be affected, because they do not cir
culate beyond a 300 mile radius. The
section fixing the rates for publica
tion follows:
"That all newspapers, magazines
and other publications regularly ad
mitted to the mails as matter of the
second class, when mailed by the pub
lisher, shall be subject to the follow
ing rates of postage, the zone system
now applying to parcel post matter
to be adopted also to second class
matter.
"Local, first, second and third zone
(under 300 miles), one cent per pound.
"Fourth zone (300 to 600 miles)
two cents per pound.
(Continued on page 4.)
HELP AVOID THE CHRISTMAS RUSH
The Christmas mail rush is on. The local postoffice is be
ginning to feel the influx of holiday mail, which will be at high
tide during the coming week. The rush and congestion cannot
be avoided, but it can he alleviated if every patron of the post
office will do his mite. Every day a long line waits at the win
dow while Christmas packages are being weighed, addresses
corrected, questions answered, and insurance tags made out.
Much of this waiting in line and delay is needless.
Next week, a window will be used exclusively for parcels.
People who intend to send packages should see that every pack
age is securely wrapped, the address plainly written and the re
quired number of stamps affixed. Before you send a package,
secure an insurance tag, take it home and fill it out, and you will
save a great deal of time for others who are behind you. Parcel
post rates can be obtained any place in the city. Don't wait
until you get to the postoffice to take up the time of the clerks
who are now rushed to the limit.
WAR CAUSES
TOY SHORTAGE
Merchants Unable to Get Stocks
of Former Years. Prices
Are Higher
If Glasgow parents wish their kid-,
dies to have the usual portion of
Christmas toys, or any portion at all
for that matter, they had better buy
early.
Toys are scarce; they are more ex
pensive than usual and local depart
ment store buyers predict that the,
price will advance as the holiday sea-•
S °m cs ° .
There are, of course, no foreign
' , . , , ± . »,
toys to be had with the exception of
, , „ , . .
those left over, and American manu
facturers are already oversold in
many instances.
In looking over the toy situation it
is interesting to note the quality of
t j, e American made toys as compared
i with the German and French. In al
mos t every instance native playthings
; are be j ng . ma d e to take the place of
t h e important kind but they are some
j how different
They are, in the first place, often of
the instructive type (not offensively
1 so), but they offer a field for develop
; men t of skill through play, which is
! directly in line with the present-day
j ideas of education.
* The "Mecano," "Tinker Toy" and
j "Erecto" are among the toys which
j allow the genius of the child builder
\ to show itself.
j One toy buyer insists that "Ameri
■ can toys are more like the real thing."
| To the miniature trains, some of the
j animals, and that ever present "cos-1
j mopolite," the Teddy-bear, this may,
; apply, but alas for the fate of the
; lively dolly, dear to the hearts of
; many little mothers.
The French kid bodied dolls, with
their go-to-sleep eyes and their nat
uarlly curly hair, are to be purchased
only at a high price and the American
novelty doll does not compare.
Musical toys are few and the be
loved mouth organ is almost in the
class of the not-to-be-hadat-any-price.
Books, games and puzzles are in
greater abundance and the Japanese
toys (if they had only had time to
arrive) would have more than made
up for the deficiency. These last are
unique in their conception and color
mg.
The animals are grotesque affairs
of wood, painted in bright yellow and
reds, with bobbing heads and wagging
tails, clever indeed but none too avail
able. Japanese dishes are coming into
the foreground.
If you would have the youngsters'
stockings as full as of yore obey the
ftigh-Cost-of-Living Bogey, and "do
j your Christmas shopping early."
NEW BILLIARD HALL
TO BE OPEN SOON
About Christmas, the new Crescent
Billiard Parlors will be opened to the
public, in the basement of the new
Rundle building.
The workmen are practically
through with this part of the building,
and Harry Hess and G. A. "Fat"
Wright, the proprietor of the new
place, are now working, getting every
thing ready for the opening day.
The bowling alleys are now in
stalled and will be a big feature of
the new recreation palace. There
are two fine alleys, with all the new
improvements in lighting and con
veniences for those who go in for this
kind of sport. The alleys will be var
nished and polished by experts and
will be the best in this part of the
state.
In the billiard hall, there will be
two billiard tables and six pool tables,
that are the best that could be ob
tained, and other fixtures according
ly. There will be plenty of large
armchairs for those who wish to
lounge and watch the games and it is
the intention of the owners to make
it as much as possible like a club.
definite date has been set yet
of f or the opening, but it will be some
i tj me around Christmas. Full details
where lovers of this indoor sport may
spend many a pleasant hour, on tables
of the big event will appear in next
week's Courier.

ALL READY FOR
SANTA'S VISIT
STORES ARE WELL STOCKED
j
j No Shortaf , e of Gifts This Ye , r in
City Well Prepared for Observ
ing Holiday Season
I
1
Glasgow. Windows in Beautiful
Holiday Dress
Glasgow is all ready for the annual
visit of Santa Claus.
The Yuletide season is upon us be
fore we hardly have time to realize it.
The tardiness of the Thanksgiving
holiday this year has shortened the
period between the two holidays by
several days and also shortened the
occasion for Christmas buying.
Fro/n all indications, it will be a
"white" Christmas, as the snow which
has fallen the past week, will un
doubtedly remain over the holidays.
This should be especially encouraging
to the little tots, as Santa will be able
to drive his sleigh with his many
reindeers.
The Christmas trade began in ear
nest this week and the large stocks
of holiday goods are rapidly becom
ing depleted. Business men predict
large sales this season and ihey de
clare the gifts this year will be of a
more useful nature than ever before.
Cards will be used more than ever be
' fore to carry the Christmas greet
ings, in place of useless trinkets.
All the local stores are now in their
holiday dress. Prettily decorated win
dows, containing myriads of gifts,
give evidence that the great day is
not far distant. The stores are ex
ceptionally well stocked, and while
there are evidences of the European
W a7intV absence "of "somTof'the
features from trfe stocks, yet on the
whole, the stores have splendid holi
day stocks and are prepared to serve
the Christmas shoppers of northern
Montana better than ever before.
Apparently Glasgow has given heed
to the "Shop Early" slogan for ever-'i
day there are hundreds of shoppy
on the streets, carrying suspicioiK.
booking bundles that will probably
make their next appearance on Christ
rttas morning In the stockings or on
the tree.
NEW BANK FOR OPHEIM
Opheim will soon have a new bank,
according to advices from the north
country. The new institution is to be
called the Farmers' State Bank of Op
j heim and wU , be ready fm business
within a short time The 8uppIieB are
j ordered and partial arrangements
made for
a building in which to begin
business.
The capital of the new bank is
$25,000 and the officers are: C. J. Lof
gren, president; F. H. Derrig, vice
j president; F. F. Smith, cashier, and
j p. M. Boukol, assistant cashier.
USES SHOTGUN
ON NEIGHBORS
I
Wm. Hamilton Tried at Sidney
for Using Weapon. Sen
tence Suspended
William Hamilton, a homesteader
livnig south of Culbertson on the Mis
souri river, pleaded guilty to the
charge of "shooting with intent to
kill," Mr. and Mrs. Pat Savage and '
their son, at Sidney, Wednesday.
While there had been many con
flicting reports of the affair circulat
ed, it developed at the hearing
Wednesday, that both parties were at
fault, and the sentence imposed on
Hamilton, was imprisonment for not
less than two years nor more than
four. Sentence was suspended, how
ever, and the defendant was placed
on parole.
According to the evidence at the
trial, Hamilton and Savage had some
trouble over cattle. Hamilton's cat
tle were on Savage's place and Sav
a p e an( j his son went to drive them
off. While doing this they met Ham
ilton, and Savage sent his son back
to the house to procure a rifle, intend
ing to use it on Hamilton. Hamil
ton got a shotgun and fired three
shots over the heads of the Savages.
Some of the stray shots struck Mr.
and Mrs. Savage, but they were only
slight wounds. Hamilton stated on
the defense that he had shot to pro
tect himself and his cattle.
