, Thit ! the plea from thousands of boy end girls who have joined t!ie MotJera I -Isalth Gade. : I
God? How do we expect to arouse
an indifferent and perishing world?
We are, ,' by such unbecoming
con d net, eowiug the seed of indif
ference, which is sweepiug down to
ruin 'down to hell great hosts of
immortal souls!
Jesus said, "I must . work the
works of him that sent ne while it
is day; the night cometh when no
man can work," ' . ,
Brother, sister, -awakel Arouse
yourselves and. get busy about
your Master's business. The night
is coming when you' can work' no
more. 'The night is coming to those
precious souls out of Christ, and if
we neglect to try to lead them to
Christ, will their ruin not be charg
able to our indolence? '
In the church where every mem
ber is truly the. Lord's, there will
be nd covetousness; for covetous
ness is the freezing of the waters
the icebergs that interrupt the" ves
sel of mercy onv her voyage of sal
vation. Covetousness is that low,
sordid, grasping spirit which cen
ters our heart and mind upon the
perishable things of earth to such
an extent that they become pur
idol a curse instead of a blessing
as God intended. 4
Hardly, any other sin sinks a soul
lower than covetousness. But that
church whose members are ruled
and dominated, by the spirit of
Christ live above all that is of a
wordly nature. They ever look
toward and work toward that high
goal of true , spirituality. Uhey
ever look toward and work toward
evangelizing, carrying the glad
gospel news to a perishing world.

OPPOSED TO STRIKES.
President Woodrow Wilson, iij
his addfress before the' joint session
of Congress at the December term,
was ontspoken in his oppoeition to
atrikes and the attacks of organized
labor upon the country's industrial
institutions.' da touching upon the
railroad phase of the, question, he
says: 4 ; ,'
The country can not and should
not consent to remain any longer
exposed to profound industrial dis
turbances for lack of additional
means of arbitration and conciliation-which
the Congress can easily
and promptly supply. ' '
VI would hesitate to recommend,
and I dare say the Congress would
hesitate to act upon the suggestion
should I make it, that any man in
any occupation should be obliged
by law to continue in an employ
ment which he desires to leave..
"To pass a law whiQli forbade or
prevented the individual workman
to leave his work before receiving
the approval of society in doing so
would be to adopt a new principle
into our . jurisprudence which I
take it for granted we are not pre
pared to introduce. But the pro
posal that the operation of the rail
ways of the country shall not be
stopped or interrupted by the con
certed action of organized bodies
of men or until a public investiga
tion shall have been instituted
which ehalT make the whole qnes
tion at iesne plain for the judgment
cf the opinion of the nation is not
to propose any such principle.
"It is baaed upon the very differ
ent principle, that the concerted
action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop in
dustrial processes of the nation, at
any rate before the nation shall
have hid an opportunity to ac

all practical means of conciliation
and arbitration. w It can
and should be done with a full and

and liberties of all concerned, as
well as for the permanent interests

is expected to make certification to
fill a contemplated vacancy in the
position of oltrih cl'..8s postmaster
at Coxbnru and othar vacancies as
. . ...... j...
they may occnr at that office, unless
it shall be decided in the interests
of the service to fill the vancancy
by reinstatement. The compensa
tion of the postmaster at this office
was $201 for the last fiscal year.
Age limit, 21 years aud over oh
the day of the examination, with
the exception that in a State where
women are declared by statute to
be of full age for all purposes at

mission, Washington," D. C. '
Applications should be properly
executed aud filed; with the Com

impracticable io examine the ap
plicants. When a man shuts his eyes to the
teachings of history, refuses to be
lieve the official records of his own
country and insists on believing
that what he thinks ought to be,
will be, although he can-not give
any reasons for so believing that
man is a fanatic and you had just,5
well let him alone. Manchester

been able to strick a lick of work
for over 14 years until I got to tak
ing this Tanlao tnediciue, said Mr.
II. W. Miller at Jacobs' Pharmacy
Saturday." ' , .
' -Fonrteen years ago'I.had a ter
rible spell of typhoid fever, and
since that time. I hadn't been1 able
to use. my right arm to do any good.
It felt weak and numb and 1 had
no strength in it, but I didn't get
Tanlao for this trouble, an I had no
idea I would ever be able to use it
again.
MI bought it for kidney trouble,
rheumatism and pains In my back
Well, it relieved me of these troub
les alright, but, strange to! saj', it
helped my arm, too. . Yes, sir, it
has actually made my arm so much
belter hat I can now do a lot of
work -something : I hadn't been
able to do in all these, years. I
don't know how to .account for, it,,
1 L ..I II- 1 1
and all my neighbors who have
known me for years will tell you
the same thing, j
"Going back to my other trouble,
I suffered a. great deal from my
back and joints, and was so nerv
ous all the time T couldn't sleep
much, Sometimes I would get so
nervous and struner-up that' the
least noise: would almost make me
jump out of bed before; I could,
control myself. ' , ;
"Mj stomach was all out of shape
too, and. I couldn't eat to do any
good. Nothing ' ceemed to taste
right, and I got so. finally I would
have vomiting spells after trying to
eat. To tell you the truth, I waa
in a mighty bad fix and was just
getting weaker and weaker,allthe
vjuivi 4, uuu ixjja vuuv nuj yu.u y
and after taking three bottles of
Tanlao I have gained 13 pounds in
weight, besides my stomach feels
just like I had bad a new one put
in, and I eat and sleep just like a
school boy. The rheumatic pains
are all gone, and I am feeling -better
and stronger hi -ovary way.
J,'lt has helped my wif, too. She
is now on her second bottle, and it
is uuiug ui mure uuu iuhu huj
thing the has ; tried in yeara. - She
was in almost as bad a fix ad I was
and it has relieved her of ailments
she has had for a long time, Both
of us think there is nothing too
good to say about Tanlao, and I
can understand wliy everybody ia
talking about it." - , '.'
