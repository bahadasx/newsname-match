Washington, Doc. 14. Serious
consideration Is being given by Presl
dent Wilson to tho possibility that any
exchanges of views that may follow
the peace proposals of the central
powers to the entente allies may de
velop an opportunity to bring forward
the suggestion for a league of nations

reached no decision, however, as to
the course to be followed by tho Unit

ing' the arrival of the official cable
gram containing the communication
handed Chargo Grow by the German
government.
The cablegram has not been re
ceived at the state department and all
officials are most reticent about dis
cussing the situation. It Is undei
stood that the communication will by
transmitted promptly to the entente
governments rogardlees of what attl
tude may be adopted by the United
States, and for this reason there It
a general belief that any steps taken
by the United States- on its own ac
count will come after formal delivery
of the proposals from one set of bel
ligerents to the other.
It Is realized that the American
course probably must be guided large
ly by the reception given the Teutonic
offer lit tho entente .countries, al
though It Is regarded as certain that
either Informally or formally, quietly
or publicly, tho government here will
find a wnv of displaying its Interest in
the restoration of peace,
Most officials think that a consider
able time will elapse after the com
munication Is delivered before a for
mal replv 1s framed lry the allies and
that in the meantime a very clear Idea
of what Hint reply Is to be and how
any attempt at mediation By neutrnls
would be viewed will "bo gained.

The trend of public opinion in Great
Britain, France and Russia is being.
followed closely, and tho American
ambassadors In those countries have
boon Instructed to forward promptly
any available indication of official
views.

the question ot legislation that may
be needed to protect the United Stated

inent that will follow the war. Some
leading Republican senators and rep
resentatives believe a concrete Re
publican program to meet this situa
tion, based on a stiff protective tariff
should be formulated without delay
and pushed by the Republican minor
ity In congress.
Senator Harding made a prognosti
cation. He said: , '
"I predict that before long Presi
dent Wilson will come out in favor of
a defensive larilT." Asked the differ
ence between a "defeusiio" tariff and
a "protective" tariff, he replied that
it Is a "difference of names only."
"Bosh!" said Senator Pomerene,
when asked If he would favor levying
a high tariff to prefect the United
State? after the war
"We didn't fear European compctl )
tion when wo had a iot of live and
husky competitors over there," he ad
ded, "Now I suppose wo must get ex
cited over tlie competition of dead
men and cripples. That kind ot talk
makes me tired." i l

SAVINGS
S
10 OVER $10,000
Vast Amount Of Shopping
Money Mailed Out
This Week
PLAN IS VEEY NOVEL
Started Here by Knox County Savings
Bank And Taken Up Last Year
By Knox Savings & Loan
Assn. Much Cash
Abroad
Over $10,000 is being mailed In
checks the last part of this week to
Knox county people who cultivated
the habit of thrift) the past year by
enrolling1 themselves In the two
Christmas savings clubs ot Mt. Ver
non. This sum of money is enormous
when one considers that It is made up
of extremely small deposits each
week, but distributed over the period
of a year.
Hundreds of people availed them
selves ot the novel plan to save mon
ey and, as a result, these people are
receiving nice, fat checks with which
to do their Christmas shopping.
There are numerous classes in the
clubs. One may pay five cents the
first week and increase this by live
cents each week until $2.50 is depos
ited iu a single week, or this process
may be reversed. Then there Is the
plan of depositing a flat sum each
week. Other classes are equally at
tractive. The Knox County Savings bank in
augurated the Christmas savings plan
in this county and has carried these
accounts for several years. Last year,
the Knox Sawngs & Loan association
opened up a Christmas money depart
ment. .Both banks pay Interest, pro
viding regular-payments are made.
Hie beauty of the plan is that the
depositor, scarcely missing the mon
ey, will find himself or herself liber
ally supplied with cash for the pur
chase of gifts when Christmas time
arrives.
Both hanks have opened their clubs
for 1917.
IN THE MORNING IS BECOMING
MORE AND MORE A HABIT
WITH MT. VERNON PEOPLE.
"That people are becoming more
and more educated to the fact that
doing their Christmas shopping ln the
morning is really a pleasure instead
of a task, is becoming more apparent
every year, remarRed a local mer
chant Thursday morning.
"And why should It not be fo?" he
continued. "In the morning the stocks
are arranged properly for careful
choosing; the salespeople are not
fatigued In the least, assuring more
accommodation and individual atten
tion to each customer; the stores aro
not so congested, making it possible
for shoppers to take their own time
in making their selections and from
every point of view. The advantages
of morning shopping are so many, why
should people not begin to realize
them?"
"I am sure there will be more
morning shopping done in Mt. Vernon
i this year, than in the past two years
together," he concluded.
. EXCHANGE OF IDEAS
VALUABLE FEATURE OF THE
INSTITUTE AT DEMOCRACY
Details are being rapidly completed
for the farmers' Institute to be held
at Democracy Dec. 29 and 30. Every
effort has been made on the part of
tho local management and the farm
ers' institute force at the Ohio Slaty
university to arrange an attractive
program.
The raising of pigs, increasing of
soil fertility, and similar topics,
while given sufficient emphasis, are
not the only things that aro to be tak
en up this season. A rural life spec
ialist, who will speak from his own
experience, will be present at the In
stitute to discuss rural social prob
lems. The most public-spirited farmers
and business men of the community
will be called together to study the
needs of our community life and to
decide on some definite rural social
iirnlilo,,, ibnt mnv nncrntrfi the efforts
of the community during the year.
William r- i.onoy, Hecruiui- ui um
fnrmers' Institute, says: "All that re
'tnains now is for our farmers to feel
tlfat it is their Institute nnd to co
operate, In order to make it the big
'gest in years. Do not forget to bring
questions about your own problems.
This Is the best chance of the year to
exchange ideas with your neighbors
and to consult the veteran farmers'
Institute speakers who will address
us,"
