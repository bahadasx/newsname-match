BULLION TRAIN CREW IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR WRECK
From tlie Snlt Itke City Koncrnl offices of the openitlriK de
imitmcnt of the Denver and Rio Gripidc it awih announced during
the week that the train crew of the bullion Arain that ran Into the
Sunnyflidc coach at Price on Thurmlay)idrniiiK of last week in le
Himniiblc for the wreck by which thrcu persons were killed and five
others fruitfully matiKled and crlppletOThe eiiBlncer of the
train was W. T. Matson and his fireman was named McCaithy.
Just after the wreck it wih stated by the crew of the train that
the air brakes had failed to work and that this was the cause of the
accident. Now, however, after the investigation it is claimed the
wreck was caused by the engine of the oncoming bullion train
blowing smoke back upon the cab of the engine No. 120C so
blinding the vision of the engineer against the coach ahead of him
that he could not sec.
No blame, whatever, is attached to the ciew of the Sunnysidc
train in chnige of W. T. Hamilton, conductor, and Harry Chambers,
engineer. They were clearly in their rights, according to railroad
rules, in leaving the Sunnysidc coach on the main lino while the
switching of their train was going on in the yards. It is also
claimed by the crew of the bullion train that there was consider
able fog hanging low the morning of the accident.
Several big damage suits against the railroad company are be
ing talked of. Considerable criticism is heard both from railroad
men and the public because of tho company rules allowing a coach
with passengers aboard to remain on the main line while a crew
was switching in the Price yards. No flagman was sent out to
protect thu Sunnyslde train befoie the wreck, this it is claimed,
being uncalled for under the rules.
The uillroad board of Inquiry at Helper to go into the wreck
was made up of R. C. Ton Eyck, superintendent of the. Gieen River
division, and W. J. Honnett, master mechanic nt Salt Lake City,
lepresonting the uillroad company, and C. C. Wallm, conductor, J.
A. Daley, engineer, C. II. Clouser, brakeman, and J. A. Van Nntta,
fireman, for the mon. The decision of tho investigating board is
that W. T. Matson, engineer of the extra freight train, erred in
judgment in regard to tho control hu had of the bullion train in
not being able to stop.
Says Superintendent Ten Eyck: "Tho railioad company's rules
do not require freight or mixed trains to flag within yard limit
boards, except against passenger trains, but requir approaching
trains to move within yard limits prepared to stop unless the main '
track is seen or known to bo clear. In this case Train No. 138 1
(Sunnysidc) was standing one thousand eighty-nine feet inside
tho west yard limit bonrd, making the npproaching train respt i-'
sible." '
The coroner's jtuy to inquire into tho wreck is composed of
Lars Gunderson, A. L. McMullen and McClure Wihon. Hearings
are to be resumed with tho return of County Attorney Fouts to the
city. The jury has already inspected tho scene of the accident,
taking such data an it is thought -will be useful and making meas
urements and the like.
