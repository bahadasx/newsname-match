Senator is chairman of the Foreign Re

1 "Our relations to the combatants are
such and our interests so involved." the
Senator said. "that I think we have a
right to speak-a right so clear as to en
eitle us to speak without asking and
i "Ithout giving offense."
le pointed out that the United States

the fued was carried to the point where
it was disturbing the pace and menacing
the safety of the balance f the com

"Why should not the same law apply.
morally and legally, to the family of na

"It Is sufficient to say. "that our mails
have been seized and destroyed or mis
used: our ships have been arrested on
the high seas and sunk; passengers and
sailors have been taken from American,
ships in sight of American territory; o'r

ACTION ON RAILROAD
BILLS SEEMS REMOTE
Senate Committee Decides to Hold
Hearings on Measures.
Prospects of early action on President
Wilson's railroad legislation program
went glimmering yesterday when the Sen
ate Interstate Commerce Committee de
cided to hold hearings on the hills pro
viding compulsory arbitration of strikes
and authorizing the taking over of the
railroads in case of military necessity or
in other emergency.
The committee set January 2 as the
date for beginning the hearings.
The opposition of the railroad brother- I
hoods and organized labor to the pro- I
posed legislation prompted the commit
tee to vote for a full investigation. I
Senator Newlands, chairman of the I
committee, announced that "the three
parties, namely, the railroad employes. t
the railway executives, and the general I
public" would be given ample oppor- I
tunity to discuss the Piesident's program. c
The Senator laid before the committee I
tentative drafts of the compulsory arbi- r
tration bill and the measure authorizing 9
the taking over the railroads.

tive and judicial bil, and advocates f
a greater advance than the 5 and 10 9e
cent graded Increases, served notice that
they would endeavor to revise the sched
ule upward when the real fight comes to
