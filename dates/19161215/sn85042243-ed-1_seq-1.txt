Fortunes Wiped Out.
Reassuring statements that no brok­

engendered a near panic that seized
the country speculators.
The extent of the fortunes made
and wiped out by the million-share
market is a matter of guess work.
Country customers suffered first and
then in the crash hundreds, perhaps
thousands, saw their speculative nest
eggs wiped off the board. Profession­

the market whipsawed this way and
taht without preference.

Coroner's Jury Probing Death of.
Karl Maier of Beulah Holds
Suicide as Cause
BETROTHED DID NOT
BREAK ENGAGEMENT
Testifies She Wrote Letter in Fit
of Jealousy To Make Him
Come Post Haste to Her
(By Staff Correspondent)
Hazen, N. D., Dec. 15.—Death by
suicide was the verdict of the coron­
er's jury late yesterday, after an
hour's deliberation in the case of Karl
Maier, Beulah ranchman, whose re­
mains were exhumed this week under
an order from Attorney General Linde
that the murder mystery theory might
be cleared or more light thrown on
the man's mysterious death.
A gre^t many witnesses were ex­
amined. John M^ier, a brother, who
had been suspected Of the crime, when
subjected to a severe gruelling exam­
ination by Asisistant State's Attorney
H. L. Berry, gave clear and unques­
tionable answers which left no doubt
in the minds of the jury that he was
innocent of the crime.
Two Bullet* Caused Death.
The postmortem examination estab­
lished the fact that two bullets caused
deatb, that they entered the chest
over he heart, one parsing out of his
side and arm and the other severing
several ribs and lodging in the intes
tines. The clothing was powder burn­
ed as was the flesh around the wound,
showing that he had held the rifle in
a perpendicular position and against
his chest at the time of firing the first
shot, the other shot undoubtedly be­
ing fired after he had fallen. to the
ground.
Letter Motive for Deed.
As a motive for the deed, a letter
was found In his pocket from his be­
trothed, Miss Rebecca Henke, which
had most likely been received the
night before the deed' was oemmitted
and which stated that she did not love
him any more, that she would rather
kill herself than live with him and
that she loved another and returned
to him a set of furs he had recently
given her.
Wr^te'Letter in Fit of Jealousy.
Upon being shown the letter, she
admitted having written It in a fit of
jealously caused by having learned
that he said he had written a former
sweetheart but i' that she wrote it in­
tending to bring him post haste to
her feet as a similar letter did on an­
other occasion. She insisted the let
ter had nothing to do with his death
and that he had been murdered, that
he must have known she had not in
tended to break their engagement or
she would have returned his ring and
that had he not been murdered he
would have come to her at once. No
evidence was produced showing any
intimacy.
Girl in Case 19 Years Old.
It is supposed now that grief over
the loss of his sweetheart, who is 19
years old and beautiful, caused him
to commit suicide in a fit of despond­
ency. He was building a bungalow in
Beulah and expected to take his bride
there shortly. Prospects of an early
marriage evidently were shattered by
the letter written in a jealous rage
by his sweetheart.
Increased News Service
For Trlbune]Readers
Associated Press and United Press news bureaus are being
established at Fargo which will furnish The Tribune, COM­
MENCING NEXT MONDAY, a more complete telegraph news
service than is carried by any daily paper in the state.
Realizing that the state capital is entitled to the best, The
Tribune has contracted to take both services, the only paper in
the state to do so. This insures an exceptional variety of tele­
graph news.
The United Press is strictly an evening news service with
hundreds of special correspondents in the war zone. While it
is on the job twenty-four hours in the day, its news gathering
machinery is especially speeded up to serve the news red hot
to evening papers.
With the Associated Press also, The Tribune will be in a
position to serve its readers much better than in the past. It
will carry more telegraph news than any evening paper in
North Dakota.
In addition it will give special service during the session
of the legislature. You will want to keep in close touch with
this session which because of the personnel of the body will be
unique in the annals of the state.
You CANNOT KEEP IN TOUCH with the legislative news
unless you have a daily newspaper from the Capital City.
Carrier service is maintained at Jamestown, Mandan and
Dickinson. Special price during session ONE DOLLAR.
By carrier fifty cents a month.

Copenhagen^. Dee. 15.—The Ru­

dispatch from Jessy,, the new Ru­
manian capital, states. A new
cabinet will be formed.
Athens, Dec. 15.—Greece has ac­
cepted the ultimatum made several
days ago by the- Entente iowers. That
the terms 'will prove acceptable to the
Greek government was indicated fol­
lowing a meeting with the cabinet
and crown council over which King
Constantine presided.
It is indicated that the demands on
Greece may require complete demob­
ilization of the army, restoration of
control by the Entente over the posts,
telegraphs, and railways, and the re­
lease of the imprisoned Venizelists.
The allies' demands mean surren­
der of arms. Greece, through surren­

King Constantine has been communi­
cating with Berlin. He probably hop­

and the Teutonic armies operating
in the Balkans.
Russian forces are retreating from
Rumania in all directions. They are
burning the villages through Wallach

Ousted Commissioners Decline To
Oust and Question Hanna's
Authority
ALLEGED UNDUE INFLUENCE
EXERTED OUTSIDE HEARING
Petitions for an appeal from the de­
cision of Governor Hanna in the Het­
tinger county commissioners ouster
proceedings and notices that an ap'
pead had been taken were filed with
Secretary of State Hall yesterday by
each of the three defendants—'Wil­
liam Colgrove, John A. Rieger and
Paul F. Schmidt—and the secretary
of state in turn served formal notice
on Governor Hanna of the action tak­
en.
The grounds' stated for appeal in the
notice served upon Secretary of State
Hell are:
FirBt: That the law under which
the said defendant was removed from
office is unconstitutional and void and
that the said governor of North Da­
kota had no jurisdiction in the prem­
ises.
Second: That there is no evidence
of any nature whatsoever introduced
or taken by the referee or the said
governor showing or tending to show
that the defendant has been, guilty
of misconduct, malfeasance, crime in
office or habitual drunkenness or
gross incompetency.
Third: That the evidence introduc­
ed wholly fails to show that any act
or thing constituting grounds for /re­
moval from office that the evidence
conclusively shows that this defend­
ant has complied with the law in all
respects and has fulfilled his duties to
the letter with respect to thfe office of
county commissioner, and that the de­
fendant at all times exercised the ut­
most good faith in the performance
of the duties of his office.
Fourth: 'That Governor L. B. Han­
na of North Dakota committed error
in admitting and considering incom­
petent, immaterial and irrelevant evi­
dence which was introduced at the
hearing, and that the referee commit­
ted error in sustaining objections to
defendant's offer of proof of certain
testimony showing the good faith of
the defendant and showing the malice
and bias of the witness for the state:
that the referee appointed to take the
testimony by the said governor com­
mitted error in sustaining objections
to testimony offered by the defendant
explaining his acts and conduct and
showing good faith.
Fifth: That the decision and order
of removal of the governor of North
Dakota was not based upon the testi­
mony introduced, but was based upon
prejudice, and bias and statements
made by. enemies of the defendant to
said governor outside of said trial and
hearing.
Sixth: That the defendant did not
have a fair or impartial trial in that
the said governor was prejudiced and
biased against him that the said gov­
ernor committed error in making his
order removing this defendant from
the office of county commissioner of
Hettinger county that said order is
in no manner supported by. the tes­
timony.

Western Union Branch Will
tribute About $400 to Its Em
ployes As Gifts
EASTERN EMPLOYES
TO SHARE LIBERALLY
The sum of $400 will be distributed
in Christmas gifts to the employes of
the Bismarck branch of the Western
Union under provisions of the gener­
al order sent out from the head offices
this week. Those who1 will share in
the distribution are employes in the
service since the first of this year.
The general order provides that all
employes receiving less than $1,200 a
year will receive 7 per tent, of a
year's salary, and that all employes
receiving $1,200 to $2,000 will get 6
per cent of a year's salary. All mes­
senger boys who have been in the
company's employment since January
1, this year, will receive a flat allow­
ance of $25. The Fargo office, the
largest in the state will distribute
$2,129 in Christmas gifts to its em­
ployes.
Drippings from the overflowing
vats of fat rendered in Dall street will
be distributed this and next week to
employes as Christmas gifts which
will break all past records.
Firms like the Guaranty Trust com­
pany of New York, will distribute
$300,000 to 1,000 employes Charles
H. Jones & Co., 50 per cent of all em­
ployes salaries the Metropolitan
Trust company 50 per cent for all em­
ployes Drepet & Doremus, 6 months'
salary the Harriman National bank,
10 to 16 i»er cent and has risked spoil­
ing its employes Christmas by telling
them in advance.
Two years ago. it is. said, there were
no bonuses. A Wall Street clerk who
had a job and regular pay was consid­
ered a very lucky young man. There
is a case, however, of a young man
who worked as a stenographer for a
year and is now said to have $250,000
of his own stowed away in the bank,
made out of the brokerage business.
In the stock exchange is Robert C.
Hancke with a $75,000 seat paid for
by the firm for whom he was a tele­
phone reporter for four years. Most
Wall Street, stenographers, however,
will go without seats on the exchange.
They will have to be content with
gifts from StOO to $500.

London, Dec. 15.—There is a stead*

allies to refuse German peace plans

Suggestions are being made that
