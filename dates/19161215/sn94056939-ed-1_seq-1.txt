MUDDLE MAY ARISE
OVER GOVERNORSHIP
Delay of dc Baca in Taking
Oath of Office and At
tempt of McDonald to
Remain May Cause Mixup.
GOVERNOR-ELECT SAIU TO
BE SERIOUSLY ILL IN CALIF.
Santa Fo, Dec. 10 -A moat
interesting question has arisen
over tliu govornship which doubt
less will be determined by decis
ion of the supremo court. Bc-
cause of the illness of Governor
elect E. C. Du Daca, who is now
on the Pacific const and conlom
plutei remaining there for some
months, no arrangements are
being made here for Ins inaugura
tion, Htui it is said that Governor
MeDonalJ will continue to dis
charge the duties of the office
until such time a - Mr. de Haca
shull be able t quality.
TliiS power Governor McDonald
will u-sume under Article 20,
Seet'in 1U7, of the Ptate consti
tution, which says: "Every offi
cer, unios romovod, shall hold
his o.Ti.,0 ii'-'.il ii' wiiuceh;' ha
diily minliruid.'
Hat it is unc!cr.-tood that the
ropni''',,iMs 'vil' i'-iifost. should
de, linca not aiiiuar to tune the
onv' nf ifln't Ho nrovision
( of Ai ucle (j, Section in), of die
constitution which says that the
toru.a uf ni! ..utlu jfficers shall
begin on the fir3t day of January
next afer the election," will dis
place McDonald.
It is intimated that an action
will b" brought to have the offi
ce of governor declared vacant,
,lf de Baca does not como for
ward nnd take the oatli of ofli-
cc, thus turning the executive
power over to Lieutenant Gover
noi'Liinlsoy under provisto:, of the
constitution, Article C, Section
7C, which says:
"In case the governor is absent
from the state, or is for any
rouse n unable to perform the
duties, the lieutenant governor
shnii act as governor, with all
tin powers, duties and emolu-
íüonts of the ofllce until such
disability bo removed."
"If the court should declares
vacancy, (lie lieutenant governor
would automatically become
uovornor. But, if before mien
decirion was rendered Mr. de
Lkcn should appear and qualify.
and after that ho should, because
of his health, not bo able to dls-
elmtw the duties of the olllco,
Mr. Lindst y would become acting
govsmor during such disability
The chief question involved
in the matter have to do with
logialution and appointments,
With de Haca governor ho would
be axpocled to veto any political
legislation passed by the repub
lican legislature, there not being
two-thirds in either house to pass
such measure over his veto.
Should Mr. Lindsey become
acting governor for even a day.
it is not unlikely that he wmild
nominate all of tho apjiointivo
offices and the members of tho
