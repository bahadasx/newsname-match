SOMME BATTIE
CAUSED PEACE
MOVyESAYS
Frederick Palmer Says Ter
rific Blows There Were
too Much for Germdily.
She Knows They will Come
Again—Germany Has No
More to Gain, He Says.
Springfield, Mass., Dec. IS.—"If
Germany is ready to make conces
sions for peace, the Somme battle is
responsible," said Frederick Palmer,
war correspondent after he read the
Teutonic overture for peace discus
sion.
"Though only from six to ten miles
depth In ground was gained, the
world has a small idea as yet of the
part this unparalleled Btruggle has
played. Germany knows that she must
spend all next summer buffeting a re
petition of the same kind of blows,
only more of them for a longer period.
"The appointment of Nivelle at the
head of the French army is significant
of the Intention of the allies to force
the fighting on the western offensive
harder than ever. He is a soldier who
believes in attack. With immensely
increased munitions the allies will
force the struggle every day that the
weather permits.
"Any one who has watched that
battle, who contemplates the enor
mous losses of next summer, is for
peace, if it means a conclusive peace.
No one wants to see the^war prolong
ed unnecessarily, least of all those
who realize Its horrors by actually
living at the front. Germany has no
more to gain. Why should she light if
she can gain no more? Why should
the allies, If they think they cannot
gain more? But they do.
"Any peace move is a good move
for military morale In Germany. The
average German soldier thinks the
war has been forced upon him. It is
Important to the German staff that hp
be kept firmly in this belief. It makes
him fight more stubbornly, because he
thinks he is fighting to save Germany
from spoliation. German soldiers, who
were taken last spring on the western
front, said that their officers had as
sured them that the war would be
over by the first of June. Those taken
In the July offensive said they were
assured that It would be over by the
first of September. The German is-al
ways fighting in' the hope that one
more blow will bring peace.
"Opinions, In every capital, whether
Paris, London or Berlin, Is finally
regulated from the trenches. The men
who are risking their lives and en
during the storms of bullets and shell
fire are the final arbiters. They pay
the prloe. If the French and English
soldiers say, through their generals,
that It Is time for peace, there will be
peace. My own opinion Is that both
the French and English armies, to a
man, will answer the German propos
als with a demand for concessions,
muoh greater than any Germany has
suggested otherwise they will fight
on."

RA1ESJFFECDVE
Drastic Regulations to Re
lieve Car Shortage Start
Today.
Washington, Dec. 15.—Drastic reg
ulations adopted by the railroads went
into effect today, with the approval
of the Interstate commerce commis
sion as emergency measures to re
lieve the shortage of freight cars
which for months has been a brake on
the country's commerce and affected
the high cost of living-
The remedy is the railroad's own,
proposed by the car service commis
sion of the American Hallway associa
tion and formally approved by the
federal commission. One regulation
provides that a consignee may have
the usual two days to unload a car
and that thereafter demurrage shall
be charged at the rate of $1.00 for
the first day, $2.00 for the second,
$3.00 for the third and $5.00 for the
fourth and each succeeding day.
Heretofore the charge has been uni
formally $1 a day.
Financier Sees Danger
in Gold Concentration
New York, Dec. 16.—George E,
Roberts, former director of the Unit
ed States mint and now an officer of
the National City bank. In an address
before the Iowa society, sounded a
note of warning against the concen
tration of gold In this country.
"You cannot use gold without la
bor, and we are not getting more la
bor," he said. "The only way you
can put more gold or more capital In
to use Is by hiring labor away from
one employment to another or by bid
ding against other buyers for materi
als and property. The effect is sim
ply to raise, wages and the cost of do
ing business until a larger amount of
money is employed In doing the eame
volume'' of business.
"There is great danger, when a
great amount of capital in the form
of gold is suddenly forced from one
country to another without a corre
sponding movement of population,
that all costs of production will be
I raised to far above those In other
countries, and that, when normal con
ditions are restored, that country will
find itself isolated from the rest of
the .world-"

CAPPER IN ADDRESS
Kansas Executive Speaks at
Governor's Conference
in Washington.
Washington, Dec. 15.—The task of
the American people is to keep one
single issue burning Into the general
human consciousness: That the world
must And some other way to settle
differences of opinion than by the
slaughter of men and the starving
of women and children," declared Ar
thur Capper, governor of Kansas,
here today in an address before the
annual conference of governors.
"Never before has such an oppor
tunity been presented to any nation
as comes to ours," Governor Capper
said. "The only danger Is that we
may lose our unique opportunity
through the scattering of our ener
gies^ through becoming confused and
ensnared in the multitude of consid
erations and possibilities which the
war brings to the minds of thinking
men and women.
"Let in the light and publicity will
cure the most of the world's Inter
national Issues. No war can be waged
successfully without support of public
opinion."
Referring to the program of the
projected League of Nations, Gover
nor Capper presented that the league
has in its proposed economic boycott
a weapon almost as powerful as war
itself. "Few nations could withstand
its pressure for long, he said. "Money,
the stock exchanges, the cables, the
wireless, the postal service, all are
international forces without which no
nation could long make war, even If
It could provide its own munitions
and provender. And If this should
fall it is not inconsistent with the
highest ideals of peace to create a
police force to maintain or compel
peace.
"Whether we look upon this war as
inevitable or consider it as the result
of the deliberate machinations of
scheming rulers, crazed by lust for
power, it Is the duty of the sane men
of the world to make this world tragr
edy the marker of a new epoch in
human progress. Humanity must
gather up the fragments of the wreck
and must begin the work of recon
struction upon .a greater plan and
With a higher purpose than any plan
with which the world has ever built.
"In the natural-trend of events It Is
highly probable that the United States
government will have a voice in the
negotiations of peace upon the cessa
tion of hostilities. Foremost among
the principles will be discussed with
out prejudice to our standing as ar
bitrators Is the principle of a per
manent peace. Better that this war
with all its unspeakable {rightfulness
and suffering should continue for
years than that it should end with
an inconclusive peace—In an armed
truce, with the contending nations
nursing their old animosities and
ready to resume hostilities upon the
Ant provacatlon or excuse."
Hughes Gets Plurality

Charleston, W. Va„ Dec. 15.—Al
though Charles E. Hughes, republican
nominee for president, carried West
Virginia by a plurality of 2,721, the
official count nearly completed shows
that President Wilson will receive one
electoral vote from the state.
Colonel S. A. Scott, republican elec
tor, who was placed on the ticket fol
lowing the resignation of J. W. Daw
son, was defeated, receiving a smaller
vote than Orlando Depue, democratic
elector.
Complete returns show that woman
suffrage was defeated by a larger ma

PEACE PROPOSAL
IS HANGING FIRE
Nothing Definite Expected
to Ensue Until Next
Week.
Further developments regarding the
peace proposals of Germany and her
allies are awaiting the consultation
and decisions of the Entente govern'*
ments as to official action te be taken.
Probably nothing definite In this
connection may be expected before
next week, the probable oooaslon be*
lng the apparance of David Lloyd
George, the new British premier, be*
fore the House of Commons mi Toe**
day. The premier who has been UU
is improving in health, And, accord
ing to today's indications, will be able
to make at that time his postponed
statement regarding the policies of the
new government.
Consequence* May Be Sertuaa.
Possible serious consequences not
only for the Rumanians^ but for the
Russians, are lnplled In today's an
nouncement from Berlin of the cap
ture of the Rumanian town of Buseu.
Military writers have very largely as
sumed It to be the Russo-Rumanian
Intention to make a defensive stand
along the line of the Buseu river,
running In a general easterly direction
not far from the southern border of
Moldavia, Rumania's northern prov
ince. The town of Buseu lies Just
south of this river, near the oenter
of the line between the Moldavian
frontier mountains and the Danube
and at the junction of the railroads
running from Ploechlt to the Danube
at Ibralla and Cjalata, northward
through central Moldavia and north
westerward to the western Moldavian
frontier.
May Be Flanked.
If the taking of Buseu, as appears,
breaks in important defensive line, the
whole Russo-Rumanian line along the
western Moldavian line seems en
dangered from flanking.
Stress has been laid by military
commentators upon the importance of
this line too, the Russians as it has
been pointed to as one to be held if
the Russian front In the southern
Carpathians and even in Gallcia was
to be preserved. Moreover It has
been indicated the falling back of the
Russian front northward In Moldavia
beyond the mouth of the -Danube at
Galata would open Bessarabia to pos
sible invasion by the Teutonic armies.
French Repulsed-
Berlin reports an abortive offensive
by the French In the Verdun region.
Attacks made In the region west of
the Meuse, to retake the positions
lost by the French on Hill 304, were
repulsed, it Is declared, as were as
saults on German positions on Pepper
ridge and near Fort Douamont, cast
of the river.
The situation in Greece Is still in
volved In uncertainty. Steps are to be
taken by the Entente to prevent the
Greek government from sending large
forces in Tessaly, where they would
be in a position to constitute a threat
to the Macedonian forces of the allies,
according to advices through Paris.
Athens dispatches by way of London
report Indications that Greece will ac
cept In principle the Entente ulti
matum.
HINDENBURG LAUDS THE
CHANCEUOR'SPROPOSAL
Field Marshal Congratulates wim xjp

—Field Marshal Von Hlndenburg,
chief of the general staff, has sent a
message to the Imperial chancellor,
Dr. Von Bethmann-Hollweg, congrat

Reichstag and adding:
"I read your speech with deep emo
tion and great satisfaction. By the
Kaiser's command you made with
this speech a great moral demonstra

at home and at the front. We sol

Is no higher or holler duty than to
prosecute victory with the utmost en

The chancellor replied, saying he
regarded Von Hlndenburg*s words' as
the voice of the German people's
army and adding:
"It Is the deeds on land and sea
that have cleared the way for the
high spirited decision which the
Kaiser and our Allies took yesterday.
The death-defying loyalty to duty and
the unshakable bravery of our men
fighting for Germany is a guarantee
to us that if it does not please the
