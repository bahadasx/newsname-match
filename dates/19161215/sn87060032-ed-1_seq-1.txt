HON. J. C. BIRD.
To the Voters of 34th Judicial District of Kentucky:
I am a candidate for the Republican Nomination' for Circuit
Judge in the August Primary, 1917.
- -It was not my intention to make this announcement quite this
early, and I am doing to only to satisfy a large number of my friends
who are urging me to make my intentions in the matter known.
In making this announcement 1 do so with full appreciation of
the vastness and importance of the duties of the office, and 1 am
sure I can measure up to them. If I should lack in knowledge I
would endeavor to make it up in hard work and honest purpose to
do right.
If I am elected Circuit Judge it will be my constant purpose to
administer the office in such a manner as will insure justice to all
classes alike, and to prevent the oppression of the poor and humble
by the rich and arroganf,
I served Whitley County as County Attorney -for four years
and I am willing to depend uyon my record in that capacity for
support in this tace.
I respectfully solicit the support of all the people, with the
promise that I will exert my supreme efforts to make a good Judge.
Yours very truly,
J. C. Bird.
Oil Well Shot
Last Friday the well that was
drilled in on the Bingham farm
was sliQt, and it is said that it
made a fine showing of oil. The
well was shot with dynamite,
and it is said that it was a good
shot, though not as good as it
would have been had it been shot
with nitro glycerine.

We have been asked many
times why we do not boost the

will boost as soon as we find
something to boost. So far there
has been little drilling, it looks
now, tnat the time of wildcaling
and pin-hooking is over and there
are some people here now that
really mean business.
