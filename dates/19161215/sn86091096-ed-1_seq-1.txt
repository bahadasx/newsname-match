CURING PORK
ON THE FARM
Method Suggested by A.
Johnson of U. of I.
F.
I
At one time in the history of our
country nearly all the goods used
on the farm were produced there.
Today such is not the case. As our
activités have become more com
plex, we are able to do fewer tasks,
but as a consequence must do them
better. This is as true on the farm
as in other lines of business. To
day no one thinks of converting the
shorn wool into clothing on the
farm. This is the work of the
manufacturer, for by his skill and
equipment he can do it better and
more economically. This statement
is not true of all lines of manufac
turing activity. In the canning of
fruits and vegetables and the prep
aration of many foodstuffs, the
commercial factory will not com
pete, either in economy or quality
of production, with the home.
The knowledge of the essential
principles of meat-curing is fast
disappearing from the farm folk,
in many localities only among the
older people and the people of for
eign extraction is this practice kept
up.
Home-cured meat is the best in
many ways. It insures the use of
clean home-grown animals with
less probability of disease. The
flavor and quality should be of the
highest rank because the farmer
can give his personal attention to
the care and fattjning of the ani
mal.
The curing of the meat commen
ces to an extent before the animal
is slaughtered. If the animal is
young and still growing rapidly,
the meat will not be firm and hard
when cured. It will always be soft
and watery. Animals should be
well matured and well finished for
the best grade of cured meat. Big
hogs weighing from 300 lbs. to 400
lbs. are best for lard; 175 lb. to
225 lb. hogs make the best size for
cured meat. The animal should be
starved for 24 hours before killing
to allow the waste materials to pass
from the body. In killing, bleed
the hog well and scald in water
just brought to a boil, to which
some lye has been added. A barrel
is good enough for holding the
water where only one or two hogs
are killed. Turn the pig in the
water so that it scalds evenly; pull
the pig out to air and then scald a
little more and the hair will usually
come out readily. Clean off the
hair and dress as soon as possible.
Let the carcass hang until it is
thoroughly cooled. In cooling, the
meat should not be allowed to freeze
~5 it will not cure evenly after
wards.
The pork may be either dry or
brine-cured with practically the
same curing mixtures. The brine
cures are usually best for the farm
because they are simpler and re-1
quire fewer utensils. I
Plain Salt Pork.
Rub the hams and bacon pieces
with fine salt and pack down in a
barrel with the hams on the bottom,
Let stand over night. Then add
for every 100 lbs. of meat, a brine
made by dissolving 10 lbs. of salt,
1-2 ounces of saltpeter in 4 gallons
water. The meat can remain in
this brine until used, or it can be
removed and smoked after from
four to six weeks.
Sugar Cure.
Another formula that gives good
satisfaction is for 100 lbs. of pork,
8 lbs. salt, 1-2 oz. saltpeter, 2 lbs.
brown sugar, to be dissolved in four
gallons hot water. This solution
should be cooled and applied to
meat that has been rubbed with
salt and drained for 24 hours. The
Badly Cut Hand
Clarence Bechtol suffered a very
painful and serious injury to his
left hand while running a circular
saw in the Kendrick Furniture
Company's shop. The thumb was
almost severed and the palm of his
hand badly lacerated. The accident
happened late Monday evening.
Clarence went to Lewiston on the
night train, accompanied by his
brother, Elmer. He received med
ical aid at one of the Lewiston hos
pitals and it is thought that the
thumb can be saved.
UNIVERSITY STOCK
1NS£P0RTLAN0
Hereford Grand Champion
Sells 45 cents Pound
The University of Idaho secured
grand champion on a two-year-old
Hereford steer bred and raised on
the university farm and this animal
was sold in the auction ring for 45
cents per pound. The University
yearling Shorthorn, "Scotty," was
made reserve grand champion and
was sold for 25 cents per pound.
The University secured champion
long wool and reserve grand cham
pion wether in open competition.
For the past three years the agri
cultural colleges and individuals
have competed for the champion
ship honors at the Portland show !
and the University of Idaho has had
two of the three grand champions
steers and three grand champion
wethers. The record of the Uni
versity at the Lewiston and Port
land shows is that Idaho has had
seven of the eight grand champion
wethers and seven of the eight
grand champion steers, or a total
of fourteen out of a possible six
teen grand champions.
All of the Idaho grand champion
wethers have been bred on the Uni
versity farm and five of the seven
grand champion steers have been
bred by the University. Benefac
tor, a University steer, last year
won championship honors over the
champion of the Panama-Pacific ex
position at San Francisco.
Idaho Troops Will Return
According to a telegram received
by Governor Alexander from Gener
al Bell of the western division of
the war department at San Francis
co, the Second Idaho regiment re
cently ordered released from border
duty at Nogales, will be mustered
out at Boise.
Preparations will immediately be
made to prepare the' barracks for
the reception of the regiment. An
expenditure of $1,000 or more will
be necessary, r as the plumbing and
the lighting and heating connections
will immediately have to be attend
ed to; the buildings will have to be
renovated, and a large number of
cots, together with bedding, instal
led to accommodate between 1,000
an d l,100 officers and men.
I ■ -----
; bacon strips should remain in solu
tion from three to four weeks be
fore smoking. The hams and
shoulders should stay in solution
from six to eight weeks. After
1 curing the meat should be smoked
both to give added flavor and to
give additional keeping qualities,
The meat before smoking should
be washed in warm water and then
drained and dried for a few days,
! Apple limbs or any hard wood may
be used for smoking. A smudge
for an hour or two daily from 15 to
20 days will give a good smoke.
The meat can can then be buried in
a grain bin or hung up in bags
which can be whitewashed or paraf
fined. Under these conditions the
meat will keep for an indefinite
length of time.
The success of every great man hinges
right on that one thing—to pick your men
to do the work. The -efforts of any one
man count for so very little! It all depends
on the selection and management of men to
carry out your plans. In every successful
concern, whether it be bank, school, factory
steamship company or railroad, the spirit of
one man runs through and animates the en
tire institution. The success or failure of
the enterprise turns on the mental, moral
and spiritual qualities of this one man. '
And the leader who can imbue an army of
workers with a spirit of earnest fidelity to
duty, an unswerving desire to do the thing
that should be done, and always with ani
mation, kindness, courtesy and good cheer,
must be ranked as one of the great men of
the earth.—Selected.
Schools Lack Supervision
In her final report on the condi
tions of the schools of Latah county
Miss Catherine T. Bryden, who is
! ^tiring after 10 years of service in
the position of county superinten
dent, summarizes the financial con
ditions and makes recommendations
designed to add to the effectiveness
of the educational system of the
county.
Lack of supervision of the schools
is given as the chief cause of unsat
isfactory work. With 97 districts
in the county it is provided that
the superintendent shall visit and
inspect the work in each one, but
no assistant is provided and it has
been found impossible to make
tours of inspection and to care for
the other work of the office at the
same time.
During the past fiscal year the
expenditures for the schools totaled
$185,833.35, of which the largest
single item was $117,049.46 for
teachers. The receipts, including
state and county apportionments,
special tax fund, returns from the
sale of bonds and from other sourc
es, totaled $182,660.99, creating an
overdraft of $3172.36.
There are 42 men and 150 women
employed as teachers. The averagè
salary for the men is $86.69, for
the women $69.96, and for all
teachers combined it is $72.25.
There are 537 high school stud
ents enrolled, 2549 elementary bovs
and 2447 elementary girls. It is
estimated there are 12 feeble minded
children attending the schools,
while one blind child and one deaf
are enrolled. The actual census of
school children places the number
in the county at 6714.
The bonded indebtedness amounts
to $180,200, while during the year,
$3800 was spent for bond redemp
tion and $9286.98 for bond interest.
New schoolhouses cost $3732.28

New Drug Store
A. C. White is putting shelving
and fixtures in the Boy Scouts'
room back of the post office, pre
paratory to installing a stock of
drugs. Mr. White was formerly in
business here before the fire. He
comes from Kooskia here, having
been in the drug business there for
a time.
The Wrestling Match
Two professional wrestlers blew
into Kendrick the first of the week
and challenged any amateur in this
vicinity to a match. Some of the
local sports finally prevailed upon
Harry Hupp, as the most likely
representative of this section, to go
on the mat with the smaller of the
two, an Indian who goes by the
name of "Iron" Chamberlain.
Tuesday night was chosen and the
crowd assembled to see the Indian
get his. It looked for a while as
tho he was sure going to get more
than he had any idea was coming to
him. Hupp was not in condition
for a match, however, having just
recovered from a siege of the
grippe, so that he couldn't keep up
the pace which he started and the
Indian secured the first fall. Harry
was too ill to continue the match,
crowd, the next two falls were
called off.
A featherweight match was
staged between Harry Stanton's
eldest son, Claude and Archie Bo
so, by the unanimous consent of the
j
len. Both of these youngsters are
promising athletes and know sever
al "holts" already. The match was
declared a draw after two rounds.
Paul Petrick and Art Hartinger
wrestled the big professional just
to show what he could do. Petrick
took him on first and Hartinger
wrestled him later in the evening.
If they had both gone after him at
the same time the result might have
been prolonged.

PLAGE EMBARGO ON
GRAIN SHIPMENTS
N. P. Railroad Tries to
Car Shortage
Help
-
As a radical step to give relief to
the car shortage situation the
Northern Pacific railway company j
Wednesday announced an embargo |
on all east-bound grain and flour
shipments. The announcement was
received by local offices of the com
pany during the forenoon, with the
statement that the embargo would
be made effective Thursday. !
The embargo applies noUonly to
the eastern terminals of the North
ern Pacific, such as Minneapolis or
Duluth, but to shipments as well
destined beyond those points.
There is an impression that the J
order will prevail for only a few f
days and is intended to relieve the
freight congestion by releasing
many cars now in the terminals.
It is explained with the embargo
going into effect the new demurrage
rules will also become effective.
These rules provide that after two
!
days the demurrage charge will be j
$1 for the first day, $2 for the sec
ond day, $3 for the third day, $4
for the fourth day and $5 for the j
fifth and each subsequent day the
car remains unloaded. The old de
murrage rule HmitejJ the charge to
$1 a day. It is explained that this
charge was so light many shippers
found it more profitable to pay it i
for 15 or 2P days than to meet the
elevator charges. The shipper was
thus also able during tho period to
give the car a new routing if he so
desired. The embargo and the new
demurrage rule it is felt will early
result in making available for other
than grain and flour shipments
many thousands of cars.
Cost of Hired Man's Board
It costs $128 per year to board a
hired hand, according to estimates |
furnished to the Department of 1
Agriculture by 1,000 farmers repre-1
senting widely separated sections in
14 States. The averages derived
from these estimates are embodied
in Department Bulletin 410, recent- ;
ly published, entitled "Value to
Farm Families of Food, Fuel, and
Use of House."
It was found that the total an
nual cost per person of board for
hired help varied from $104 in Ver
| „ont and Pennsylvania to 5162 in
! New Jerse y- and that the P^cent
age of this cost paid out in cash
varied from 15 per cent in North ,
! Carolina to 49 per cent in Califor
I nia. This percentage is about one

Will Furnish Power to Kend
rick and Troy.
At their recent session, the board
of county commissioners granted a
1 * ranc hi se to the Potlatch Consoli-
dated Electric Company, giving the
Company the right to construct and
maintain an electric line for the
transmission of power along the
highways of the county between
Troy and the City of Moscow. The
franchise will be effective as soon
as the required surety bond of
$5000.00 has been regularly filed
by the power company in favor of
Latah County. The exact route of
the line has not been definitely de-
cided upon at this time but active
work along that line will start as
soon as the bond offered by the
power company has been accepted
by the Board.
j Owing* to the increasing demand
| f or p0W er and light in the Potlatch
section, the company anticipates
that they will not be able to supply
the needs of the communities served
by its lines from the generating
p i an t a t Kendrick. For this rea
! son , they have decided to buy addi
to tional power from the Washington
Water Power Company which they
or vvill distribute in the towns of Troy
an( j Kendrick for light and power
purposes. In order to secure this
J additional power, it is necessary for
f them to build a line from the town
0 f Troy to Moscow which will corn
pjete the connecting link between
the lines of the two companies.
The new line will transmit the
power at a voltage of 13,200 volts
and will be constructed according
