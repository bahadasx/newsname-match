PRICES DROP SLIGHTLY AS WAR
ON SPECULATORS IS CAR
RIED FORWARD.
Nation-wide federal grand jury in
vestigations into the high prices of
fuel and food were undertaken this
■week by the department of justice.
Grand juries have instituted action
In New York, Chicago and Detroit,
and similar action will follow in Mil
waukee and Minneapolis and on the
Pacific Coast. A federal grand jury
called in Seattle this week will go
over evidence gathered by federal
agents during the past two weeks.
Meanwhile the "cost of living" has
begun to drop. Advices from all sec
tions of the country to the depart
ment of agriculture and department
of justice indicate this fact. The re
duction in prices, while small, is
general. Officials believe that it will
be continued.
Evidence of Conspiracy.
They believe the cause to be the
announcement of the government
tbat criminal prosecutions of food
price manipulators are certain. Offi
cials of the department of justice
claim they already have concrete
evidence of conspiracy against big
board of trade dealers, middlemen in
almost every line of food supplies and
others. Concerted action Is planned
against these persons. The agents of
tbe department of justice, operating
under the orders of United States
Attorney Anderson of Boston, who is
In charge of the special investigation,
already have turned in reports wbicb,
it is stated, show general conspira
cies to manipulate prices.
This information was presented to
President Wilson and he directed
tbat immediate prosecutions be un
dertaken.
The chief obstacle in the way of
prosecutions is the desire of the ad
ministration that those persons who
bave been active participants in the
alleged conspiracies shall not gain
Immunity by being summoned to tell
of their operations before a grand
Jury- This has proven a knotty
problem, but the officials say that
they are fully confident that it can
be solved.
• Can Sidetracked.
Much of the evidence so far
amassed deals with the holding up
of coal cars, refrigerator cars and
tbe like. These cars have been held
idle on sidings at various points
while a scarcity of products has
forced prices skyward. Department
of justice officials insist they will be
able to show that in certain Instances
at least these cars were held as the
result of a conspiracy between deal-1
ers in the big Eastern cities and the \
men who had control of them.
So far as embargo legislation by
congress is concerned, it is agreed by
administration leadefs that there is
no chance of Its being successful If
directed against food products simply
to keep down prices. Even though
tbe house should pass any such leg
islation, the administration is in con
trol of the senate and would kill it
in a hurry.
Two startling discoveries have
been made in the federal investiga
tion into high prices of food in the
Chicago district. They were:
That the egg supply of Chicago is,
and has been for months, controlled
by four men: James Wete, self
styled "egg king of America," H. M.
Elchengreen, C. B. Ford and Louis
Richter.
That several storage warehouses,
anticipating Just such an investiga
tion, have been keeping a duplicate
set of books, one of actual transac

The information regarding the dupli

who mentioned it casually.

ABOUT BIG AUTO FACTORY
AM) ORGANIZATION.
I
Enthusiastic over the Overland
, models for the coming season and
, tickled with the trip he had. W. E.
, Bronson, of the Bronson & La Gue
; Auto company, local Overland repre-
I sentatives, returned Tuesday from a
visit at the Willys-Overland factory
in Toledo, Ohio, where 5,000 Over
land dealers gathered the fore part
of this month as guests of the com
pany.
Recounting his trip, made on a spe
cial train with 228 other Overland
, dealers from Washington. Oregon,
California and Nevada, Mr. Bronson
says he was chiefly impressed with
I the fact that the company is directed
'and handled by men in the prime of
life, all of the beads of departments
and superintendents being young
men, while there were mighty few
dealers. To this youth
and among the directing heads
of the organization Mr. Bronsoi) as
cribes the energy and enthusiasm
which has pushed tbe business ahead,
j Size of Business Remarkable.
I Tbe Immensity of the business, of
the plant, machines, stocks of mate
, rials, and the speed and precision
wltl) which the finished cars are pro-
duced. are remarkable, Mr. Bronson
says, referring as a sample to the
six-story administration building
housing the company's offices, the
top floor of which is given over to
a restaurant, where 800 of the deal-
ers were fed at a time, and to an
auditorium seating 2,500. On the
company's pay-roll are 17,300 em
ployes.
The dealers, during their two-day
stay at the plant, first made an in
spection tour of the plant, the guides
being carefully picked men who
knew the factory from end to end,
and the parties small so that each
member could have his questions an
swered. This trip took two and a
half hours, and then the dealers ad
journed to the auditorium, where for
another two hours moving picture
machines displayed to them the de
tails of all the important manufac
turing processes.
The new models for the coming
season constitute a beautiful line of
cars and aroused enthusiasm of all
the dealers, Mr. Bronson says. He
expects a carload shipment to arrive
about January 1, which will enable
him to display the leading models to
all interested persons in this terri
tory. A feature of the company's
policy, referred to by all department
heads in speaking to tbe dealers. waß
that it had attained the quantity of
production desired and that here
after all of its efforts would be di
rected to constant Improvements in
tbe machines.
While at the plant,, the Northwest
dealers presented John N. Willys,
president of the company, with a
bouquet of Washington flowers. Fred
Chandler, the Overland dealer at
North Yakima, making the presenta
tion. The train on which the North
west dealers traveled consisted of
nine sleepers, two diners, a club car
and two observation cars, all con
nected by a telephone svstem. Tbis
train. It was estimated »•«« the most
expensive of all of the specials pro
vided by the companv for its deal
ers. because it traveled the longest
distance, and cost in the neighbor
hood of $35,000.

FREEMAN BROWN HURT IN
TACOMA AUTO ACCIDENT
Weil-Known Pioneer, Former Olym
pian, Is Badly Cut
About Face.
Old-time Olympia residents learned
with regret this week of the accident
which befell Freeman W. Brown, a
former resident of Olympia and one
of the oldest pioneers of the state,
who was seriously injured in Tacoma
last Saturday afternoon when he
tripped over a rail of the street car
track on St. Helens avenue and fell
against the running board of a pass
ing automobile.
Mr. Brown was taken to the Taco
ma General hospital for treatment,
having received several bad cuts about
the face. Mr. Brown is 84 years old,
and his advanced age increased the
apprehension of friends when they
learned of the accident. Attending
physicians, however, reported that the
injuries were not serious and that he
would be able to leave the hospital
after a few days' treatment.
Mr. Brown first came to the state
in 1854. and was a member of Cap
tain Gilmore Hay's company of vol
unteers who successfully conducted a
campaign against the Indians. He
made his home in Olympia for years,
and the family is very well known
here, one of the sons, Fred Brown,
having served Thurston county as en
gineer and school superintendent.

Importations Except for Sacra*
mental Purposes.
A "bone dry" prohibition law, for
bidding entirely the importation and
possession of intoxicating liquor ex

state at a meeting in Seattle Tuesday
afternoon under the auspices of the
Anti-Saloon League of Washington.
The measure provides for the abo
lition of the personal permit system

FARM AOENT TO START
WORK HERE JANUARY I
Lack of Funds Causes Delay, Super
visor Coglan Writes Fred W.
Lewis.
Tfiurston county's farm a&ent will
arrive about January 1, if the United
States department of agriculture car
ries out an agreement recently made,
according to word received this week
by Fred W. Lewis, of Brighton Park,
from R. B. Coglan, state supervisor
of county agents for the Extension
Department of the State College.
The agent was to have started work
here November 1, according to the
contract the county commissioners
signed with Mr. Coglan last summer,
( but Mr. Coglan explains that the ex
tension department's lack of funds
made this impossible. The federal
department of agriculture, however,
has practically agreed to advance the
department the money with which to
carry on this work until its own
funds become available next July.
On this basis, Mr. Coglan writes
Mr. Lewis that he expects to have an
agent in the field here by the first of
the year. He expresses regret that
the expert could not have been here
in time for the agricultural exten
sion school, for the opportunity it
offered to become acquainted with
farmers. Mr. Coglan plans to spend
several days here with the new
agent,'to assist him in planning his
work and getting it started.

FARMERS TO MEET DECEMBER
23 TO COMPLETE NEW
ORGANIZATION.
Decision to organize a Breeders'
Association among the dairymen of
this county was taken at the meeting
at the Chamber of Commerce last
Saturday afternoon, when the in
structors of the Agricultural Exten
sion school conducted a special dairy
day program, and S. C. Gibson, su
pervisor of the cow-testing work of
the state, made a short talk.
The proposed Breeders' Associa
tion is to be organized at a meeting
of dairymen in this city "at 10 o'clock
Saturday afternoon, December 23,
the date for the regular meeting of
the Thurston County Dairymen's as
sociation, and members of this or
ganization, the Cow-Testing associa
tion and all other farmers interested
In Improving their herds, are expect
ed(and urged to attend.
Plan of
The general plan to be followed
by the Breeders' association is ex
plained by L. R. Campbell in the fol
lowing communication received this
week:
i"Editor Washington Standard:
"Dear Sir:—As per your request
I will state briefly the facts concern
ing the meeting last Saturday at the
Chamber of Commerce, at which t!he
subject of dairying was discussed in
general and the community breeding
feature in particular.
"The decision was reached that on
Saturday afternoon, the 23d inst., we
would hold a meeting at the Chamber
roomß at 1 o'clock to organize a
Breeders' association, probably to be
known as the Thurston County
Breeders' association. The plan us
ually followed in an organization of
this kind Is for the banks to advance
money to farmers to buy pure-bred
bulls. The farmers then would pay
the regular service fee into the as
sociation, which goes to liquidate the
indebtedness incurred in purchase of
bulls..
"The farming district would be
divided Into blocks, each bull to be
kept in a block by a farmer who Is
named by the board. The farmer
keeping the bull would be allowed
$75 per year for his feed and and
care. As each bull has served his
usefulness in his block he Is shifted
to another.
. "This plan may not be followed
In detail, although It has been
worked out In other localities.
Improvement Needed.
"There Is great need In our county
of breeding up our dairy cattle. Our
cow-testing records show the need
of Improvement. By organizing a
Breeders' association and following
some such plan as this, the man with
the small herd who cannot afford to
Invest in a first-class sire will be able
to improve his herd at small cost.
"The meeting on the 23d will be
the regular meeting of the Thurston
County Dairymen's association, and
nil the members who-oan attend, to
gether with members of the Cow-
Testing association, are urged to do
so."

NEWSPAPER COMMENT INDI
CATES HOSTILITY TO
ENDING WAR.
Formal proposals by Germany and
her allies, made Tuesday, that nego
tiations for peace in Europe be un
dertaken, apparently will be rejected
by England, France and Russia, judg
ing from the sarcastic comments of
allied newspapers, and such an out
come, it is believed, will mean that
the European war will be prosecuted
with still greater intensity on all
sides, with the responsibility for its
continuance placed on the allies.
Germany expected her peace pro
posals might be rejected when she
made them, according to advices re
ceived in diplomatic circles in the
United States, but the opinions of
neutral diplomats at Washington, D.
C., agree that Germany has made a
master move in diplomatic and world
politics, and a strong bid for the sym
pathy of the neutral world which it
will be hard to offset.
No official comments have been
forthcoming from any of the allied:
governments, while the action which,
the United States may take looking
to a renewal of its offer of media
tion, will not be decided until Presi
dent Wilson receives information as
to the sentiment in the various na
tions on the subject. Washington of
ficials do not look for the situation to
crystalize until the first of next week.
President Wilson would like to
evolve through peace negotiations an
association of nations designed to
keep the peace, and if he can see his
way clear to do so, he will suggest
such a proposition in transmitting
the German peace suggestions to tbe
allies. The greatest good that will
come from the German offer, It is be
lieved, will be to revive the efforts
of neutrals to bring about peace.

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 15. —The
area of winter wheat planted In the
three Pacific Northwest states this
