during the ten days' contest, the
number of the team ahead being
placed first and the others in their

THE LOCAL POSTOFHCE
Some Facts Relative to the Work
of the Office of Interest to the
Public.
There are many people who do not
grasp the amonnt of business trans
acted in the U. S. postoffice depart
ment each year. Neither do they
take into consideration the responsi
bility and painstaking care perform
ed by all those connected with this
work. When time is taken to look
into details and the promptness and
accuracy of handling Uncle Sam's
mail is shown, it is then possible to
grasp in some degree the admirable
system that makes possible such ac
curate work.
This system is carried out in every
postoffice and the local office is one
cog in the wheel necessary to keep
up this efficiency. The business
transacted in the local postoffice telk '
in a large degree the business ac
tivity and prosperity of the local
field it serves.
The postoffice in this village is a
busy place and transacts much more
business than many of its patrons
realize. The present postmaster,
D. P. MacKenzie, has held the office
two years; his predecessor was
J. S. Sweeney, who served the pub
lic as postmaster for many years.
Since postmaster MacKenzie has
been in charge of the office many
changes have been made to further
increase the efficiency of the office
and meet the increased patronage.
Parcel post racks, pouch racks and
stamping tables have been added,
these being on castors and easily
moved about the room for conveni
ence in carrying on the work. A
partition was removed, making the
room larger, and this fall a furnace
has been installed.the chimney in the
office-room taken out. These im
provements make the office comfort
able and increases the floor space.
The room has been papered and
painted, making it attractive. All
these improvements have added to
the general good of the office in
making pleasant surroundings for
employes and patrons.
The office has day and night clerks
and takes care of ten in-coming
mails daily and despatches an equal
number. There are 1000 patrons of
the office including the rural free
delivery. The parcel post and money
order business has greatly increased.
Postmaster MacKenzie is a cour
teous and efficient official and serves
the patrons of his office faithfully
and well. He is a staunch democrat,
and likely to continue in this office,
for the public is pleased with his
work, and certainly the department
has no cause to make a change.
