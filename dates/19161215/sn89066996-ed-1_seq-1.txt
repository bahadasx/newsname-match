Farmington Local
Option Contest
The Farmington local option con
test case, which was taken to Iron
county by the "wets" on a change of
venue, came up in the Circuit Court
at ronton before Judge, Hearing last
Saturday. B. II. Boyer, attorney for
the "wets", dismissed the "Trauer-
i mem case , which was the one wnere-
I 1 il . 'J L 1L. A 1.1
in me mayor una c;icii 01 me iuor
men were made defendants, and filed
an amended petition in the "Fischer
case", wherein he alleged as an addi
tional and new ground for contest
that there were no booths nor ballot
boxes furnished and used at the elec
tion. The "drys", by tneir attorneys, con
tended that this was a new contest
and asked the court to continue the
case to the next regular April term
C 1 i 1 7 ) of the Iron County Circuit
Court, which was done. This carries
the case over to the fourth Monday in
April, 1!H7.
The "wets" had an array of witness
es on hand and demanded a trial, but
Judge Hearing ruled that the "drys"
had reason to rely on the good faith
of tHe "wets" in filing their amended
petition, and had the right not to
cause any witnesses to be subpoenaed
and be present. As the case now
stands the pleadings are to be made
up in April, 1917, and the case tried
then.
Germany Makes
Peace Proposal
Following up her recent successes in
arms in overrunning Roumania, Ger
many, with the allied central powers,
has made a tentative proposal to the
Kutente Allies for peace negotiations.
The German Chancellor announced
this fact in the Reichstag on the 12th
inst. He said he hud that morning
sent a note proposing peace negotia
tions to the hostile powers through the
representatives of Spain, the United
States and Switzerland looking after
Germany's interests in those coun
tries, asking them to deliver it. The
London Foreign Office declined to dis
cuss the peace proposal until the terms
shall have been received, but one
prominent English official expressed
grave doubt that any terms Germany
might suggest would offer even a
basis for negotiations. Acceptance
by the Entente Alliance is considered
very unlikely.
COUNTY SCHOOL NOTES
The annual meeting of the County
Text Book Commission as required
by law will be held at the office of
the County Superintendent on next
Saturday, beginning at 10 a. m. Prob
ably no formal adoptions will be made,
however, before April, 15, 1917.
Miss Ruth Spradling of the Lambeth
school reports having made $28.12 at
a recent box uspper. This money she
has expended for a suitable bookcase
and an excellent line of library books.
Great progress has been made during
the current school year in adding to
t.he libraries of the rural schools of
the county. The teachers are taking
tho law into their own hands and art
raising the necessary money by va
rious kinds of entertainments. This
is well enough, but school officials
Should not ignore the law which re
quires that not less than five cents
per pupil enumerated in the dis
trict be set aside, out of the levy made
for incidental purposes, for the pur
chase of necessary supplementary and
reference books. If this law were
strictly obeyed cverv district in the
county, however poor, could soon have
a good working library.
Mica Ttlomevor of the Su
gar Grove school staged a play at the
Colony Church recently, tne was
(not the pupils) of her community.
The proceeds, about $24, will be used
In making a payment on their modern
heater which was installed at the be
ginning of this term.
The board of directors of the Roug
gly school have just ordered a modern
heating plant. The Rouggly people
seem determined to give their chil
dren a fair start in the battle of life.
All praise to them! Who will be next
to fall in line? Forward march!
Miss Anna E. Overall of the DeLas
sus school has ordered a copy each of
the Ayres Spelling Scale and the Ay
res Penmanship Scale. Teachers de
siring these scales, can get them at
15 cents each by writing, Russell Sage
Foundation, Division of Education,

scales may be seen by calfmg at this

Christmas Buyers
The Times wishes to suggest to all
prospective Christmas shoppers that,
before starting in search for remem
brances for family and loved ones,
that 1 hey carefully inspect the adver
tising columns of this paper. Thry
will find that a few minutes so spent
will he most helpful to them, and will
perhaps be the means of savi'tg them
both mney and time in their shop
ping expedition.
In The Time3 will be found adver

progressive merchants, who think
enough of your patronage to render
j you every assistance in theii' power,
and who strive in their advertising

mation of what you may expect to
find in their stores. Times advertise
ments will not only prove to be money
and time savers, but are most read
able and attractive to the eye.
Get the habit of reading Times ad
vertisements. You will never regret
it. In fuct, it will soon fasten itself
on you, and you would not dismiss it
if you could. And remember, too, that
the home advertiser is he who is en
titled to all your trade, for he is
helping to support the mainspring in
j the community, which is the readable
home paper. And the fact that he is
an advertiser, who does not desire to
choke the eagle on the coin when he
gets hold of a piece of money, is the
best possible evidence that you will

tiser than by the non-advertiser.

OYSTER FRY
Direct From
Factory To. Yon
The people of-this county have been fooled long enough into buy
ing stenciled pianos and paying standard prices, and since I have
secured the agencies of these great Piano Manufacturers I consider
that I have used good judgment and am offering the public a chance
of deciding between the stenciled, or cheaper grade of instruments at
a grtat-big-price or straight-forward first-class instrument at a much,
lower price. That is my sole reason for not buying goods in St.
Louis as there arc no piano3 manufactured there and all that come
from there are handled through the jobber or the middleman, hcr.ee
the cause of high prices and the stenciled pianos. I earnestly and
honestly invite competition of both St. Francois county pd St. Louis
dealers. You may ask "How can you do it? This I have previously
explained, and now I ask you to inquire of the people who have already
purchased nnd see if they are not satisfied with the "Giliam Way"

Prof. Dearmont, coach of the High
School Foot Ball Team, gave the boys
,a:i oyster fry Tuesday evening at
Kinney's as a token of his appre
ciation of their victory over the Jack
son team on Thanksgiving, and Geo.
Morris stood for the liquid refresh
n.e.ts. Capt. Tom McKinney of the
team says that with such hacking as
the High School boys, has received
this year they will make more of the
same kind of records.
New and Renewal
Yes, We Believe
In Real Boosting
In regard to the present man
agement of the Times' penchant for
"boosting." That has sometimes been
said to be "our middle name." When
there is anything to boost, there we
are entirely at home. This is the rea
son we feel entiiely "at home" in
Farmington, and we are now just get
ting our "booster" well fitted, with
the hearty co-operation of some of
our most enterpi ising citizens. Out
work along this line is just now be
ginning, with the almost unexampled
resources in this community, which
has come to our attention. Bu. we be
lieve in building from the ground up,
and when we see anything, especially
a public utility, apparently floating,
with apparently no solid foundation,
such as at present appears to be tho
condition of the Farmington telephone
system, then it is the duty, we be
lieve, of a real booster, to administer
a few sharp knocks in order to bring
it to earth. In order to build truly,
safely and solidly, occasionally there
is an old hulk that must "come down."
Then is when well directed "knocks"
are -helpful.
The Times is more than pleased
with the splendid support I hat has
been forthcoming from the live, en
terprising citizens of this community
in the light it has been making for a
bigger and better Farmington, and sb
long as our efforts in this direction
meets with such hearty approved it
woi:ld be ungrateful in us to say the
least, to "knock off" on such .vorK.
Christmas Tree
Entertainment
and Caroling
The City Council has agreed to fur
nish a tree, put it up; light and deco
rate it, and turn over to the women's
organizations of the town for the de
tails and further arrangements of car
rying "but the municipal Christmas cel
ebration. The several women's organizations
met last Saturday afternoon and de
cided upon a plan. On account of tho
uncertainty of the weather at this
season, they determined not to have
any out-door exercises and distribu
tion of gifts from the tree. A "giv
ing and not getting" spirit will bo en
couraged, but the tree will be placed
op the Public Square and dressed out
in all the Christmas brightness to
charm the eye and senses.
But that is not to be all. The la
dies arranged for a splendid Christ
mas entertainment at the Monarch
Theatre at 4:45 o'clock on the Satur
day afternoon before Christmas. An
excellent program will be presented,
consisting of orchestral and other mu
sic, an appropriate address by some
local speaker, a reading of Vandyke's
"The First Christmas Tree," Christ
mas carols and other exercises.
Then, on Sunday night after the
Sunday School exercises at the sev
eral churches, four bands of Carol
Singers will go out through the town
and sing wherever the homes are dec
orated with a burning candle in the
window, to show that the people there
enter into the spirit of the Christmas
time, and receive whatever donations
they feel disposed to make. The do
nations thus made will be used for
charitable purposes, and it is hoped
that the people may open their hearts
and make them liberal.
The following committees were ap
pointed to superintend;
Music Mrs. K. C. Weber of tho
Monday Club.
Program Mrs. J. Paul Cayce of tho
Daughters of the American Revolu
tion. Press Mrs. Harry Denman of the
Methodist Episcopal Church.

A Comparison
. A mineral report from Joplin on
the lit of the month gives the zinc
and lead production of that district
for the past eleven months. It is plac
cd at a total valuation of $30,3X1,000,
of vhich $26500,OO0 is for zinc ore
and $V"'0,OOO for lead ore. This is
an increase of $i,000,000 in zinc and
11,713,000 in lead over the correspond
ing period last year.
No reports are given out for pub
lication of the lead products of St.
Francois county, ro we have no way
of getting at the exact figures, but it
is estimated that more than $fi0,000,
000 of lead ore has been produced or
mined by the several big companies
in this county. This is about double
the while of the zinc and lead com
blm d : tho Joplin district. Tho net
profits of the companies of thin coun
ty tho ist year are estimated nt
about 000,6'iO: the net p.vfit of one
Compaq Is nil to be $7,000,000.
From v. ib, as li.'tle as 13 said about
it in published statistics of ore pro
ductions, St. Francois county leads
all others in the. State. '
The Busy Little Fly
In last Sunduy's St. Louis papers

Friends cf Miss Mabel Sackmunn,

To keep their marriage a secret the
couple decided that Mrs. Nations
