will gladly admuit, say those who al
ready know, as soon as the federal
go\vernment is reutady to invite the world
to come and ride on its new railroad
to the new Mount McKinley national
park, remarks a writer in the New
York Times.
The railroad, strictly a government
enterprise, Is now under construction.
A bill to set aside 2,200 square miles
of the Alaska range, the highest land
on the continent, as a national park
has been introduced by Mr. Wicker
sham and Is pending in congress. But
park and road should be considered to
gether in making any forecast of what
Alaska is going to mean to the country
at large. The railroad, which starts
at Seward, on the southern coast of
the peninsula-the Gulf of Alaska-is
to run north to Fairbanks, a distance
of 400 miles, or almost half way tQ

The new railroad will bring Mount
McKinley within three weeks' travc.
of New York city, which is another
way of saying that the sledloads of
dead animals will become a great deal

Little Gold in Proposed Park.
There is no fear that the mining
ant lhunting privilege will Ie a ltnute
to the rt~ion as a park. "As a matter
of fract," said Robert Sterling Yard,
who is associated \ ith Mr. Mather in
all nati()nal park matters, "we do nit
expec't the rlniing operations to
Lt)amount to much, for the evidence of
the geological experts indicates that
there is litt gold in the region which
Is to bIe set apart. As to the game,
we will have in Mount McKinley park
the re.lpettion of the story of the Yel
lowstoine, xheucre there has not been a
gun tired legally since 1872 and where
there is more game now than before
the comIing of the white man, for now
there are no Indian hunters. Cavalry
patrols and ceaseless watching for
poachers have made the Yellowstone
a paradise for animals. McKinley is
that now, always has been and with
the passage of this bill, always will
be."
But the conservation of wild life, as
iniportant as that is, is bunt one of the
olbjects which the government has in
view in the Alaska range.
The line of the railway runs within
a dozen or 13 miles of the Alaska
range and parallel to it, and from
BIrnatd pass, 200 mrilles from Seward
on the railroad, will be easy going to
the great McKinley, which dominates
that range.
The railroad. at least to Broad pass,
will be ready for operation by the sum
mer of 1917, either by the government
itself or by private capital under fed
eral lease, a detail that has not yet
been worked out, but the main point
is to get Mount McKinley and the 2,200
square miles of surrounding country
under the jurisdiction of the depirt
ment of the interior as a national park
before the stream of tourist travel is
turned into the country over the new
line. Otherwise there will be serious
damage to one of the chief assets of
the region, Its present abundance of
Igreat gatne. So keen is the apprecia
liin of this danger that Assistant See
retary lMather is being backed in his
efforts to get the required legislation I
by the Atmericain Game Protective as
sc:ition t Ille ('amp Fire Club of
America and the Boone and Crockett
club.
Is Paradise of the Hunter.
Belimore Brow\ne, the explorer and
hunter, h\li has spent three years on
Mount McKinley, has, in behalf of the
ldepartment and of the cominittee on
con(servation of forests and wild life of t
the ('iamp Fire club, issued an appeal
for the establislhment of the park in
which he says:
"lhere caul still be seen the wild herds
protected from man by the rugged
ness of the country. Giant moose still
stalk through the timber line valleys,
herds of caribou move easily across
the moss-covered hills, bands of white
big-horn sheep are on the mountain
sides, while at any time the powerful
form of the grizzly bear may give the
crowning touch to the wildness of
the picture. But while the Mount 1Mc
Kinley region is the fountainhead
from which come the herds of game
that supply the huge expanse of south
central Alaska, that fountainhead is
menaced. Civilization is closing in, and
already sledloads of dead animals from
the mountain country have reached
Fairbanks market. Unless a refuge is
set aside in which the animals that
remain can breed and rear their young
unmolested they will soon follow. the
and the coaservatle of Its game are
not, singly or together, sufficient Jus
tification for this park project (which
they are, of course), and we still have
a third reason, sufficient in itself,
which justifies McKinley and all the
other national parks of the country.
These great reservations cannot be dis
missed as merely recreational or sen
timental, esthetic or educational. They
are all that, but, most important of
all, they are economic. They consti
tullte great business asset. as such
hitherto overlooked entirely by the
country.
"Switzerland lives on her scenery.
She has devewloped it scientifically into
a busiless. She maiintains tourist a.geIn
cies anl expensive publicity opera
tions in every for 'Ign country fr-omn
which profitable income may he de
rived. She entertains the world. A
few years ago Canada went into this
samie scenery bIusiness, cnombining
American imagination and enterprise
with British thoroughness. She adver
tisedl extesively and iwisely, and today
Swiitzrlnnd and Canada share the
scenic reputation of the world, also
the profits. The Alps and Lake Louise t
are their rival assets.
How the Government Advertises.
"P.tt the assets of the United States
for this samte sort of enterprise are
the best in the world. The difficulty in
the necessary propaganda or educa
tianal work, or whatever you want to
call it, is that this country's stock In
trade is of such magnitude and such
rare quality that if you even attempt
to describe it adequately people won't
believe you.
"So the government sticks to the
barest facts, tells the world that in its
Glacier park more than sixty glaciers,
comin;g from cliffs thousands of feet
high, feed hundreds of lakes, in one of
which the icenergs last all summer.
And we let it go at that, not a single
adjective, and It is the same way
throughout the list of the eight na
tional parks of the first order. But
that may he the best way. Why should
the United States try to embotlish the
fact that in its Sequoia national park
there are a million or more sequoia
trees, 12,(000 of which are more than ten
feet in diameter and some of thema
more than 36 feet? If I were not In
the government service I might simply
say 'some trees.'
"In the park in the Alaska range,
when congress turns it over to this de
partment, the people of the United
States will have the top notch of the
scenery of the world In their own
keeping for all time. Mount McKinley
itself is more than 20,000 feet high.
There are greater heights in the Hlma
layas, it Is true, but they are not domi
natlng because of the high average
level of all about them. McKinley. on
the contrary, is so Isolated in Its mag
nitude, so much greater than the rest
of the range, that It presents the spec
tacle of a sheer rise. of 17,000 feet.
Furthermore, It is accessible, or soon
will be. The Himalayas are not."

THE FINISH OF LORD FERRERS. I
IN THE ighteenth century the hang- 1
man was the busiest man in Eng- i
land. The death penalty was inflicted I
for the most trilling misdemeanors. I
Men were hanged for stealing spoons, 1
for defrauding their creditors, for per- 1
jury, arson, disturbance of the peace. I
There 4as no discrimination in favor
of the women. Scores of servant I
girls were hanged in those grand old I
days for offenses which would scarce
ly draw a reprimand in these easier I
times. Naturally, the hangman and
his assistants, and the jailors, and all <
who had to do with the condemned, 4
were calloused and brutal; and a
doomed steer at the stock yards re- I
ceives more consitderation now than
did the doonmed human being then. He I
was hustled from the prison to a cart I
or sledge and hauled to the gallows
without ceremony, and arrived at the
fatal tree he was "turned off" as part
of the day's work.
Yet snobbery was possible even in
this dismal matter of execution. The
treatment that was good enough for a
poor but respectable thief wasn't good
enough for a blooming nobleman; and
the plain people of London never knew o
how artistic a hanging could be until I
Laurence Earl Ferrers met his fate at I
Tyburn.
Lord Ferrers had the blood of Plan
tagenet kings in his veins. His ances- 1
tors for ages had distinguished them

selves on battlefield and in council
room, and one of them, who died hero
Ically at Shrewsbury, is mentioned by
Shakespeare. The earl himself was a
man of high ability, and when he was
sober, which happened perhaps once in
four or five years, he was said to have
the most charming manners. IBut he
kept himself pickled nearly all the
time, and his charming manners were
not in evidence. He flew into sense
less rages over nothing, conceived vio
lent prejudices against people, and al
ways was threatening to kill one per
son or another. He was so cruel to his
wife that she applied to parliament
for relief, and parliament granted her
a separate maintenance, with the rev
enues from certain farms and other
property.
William Johnson was his lordship's
steward, and because he had to pay
money from the estate to the lady, the
earl began to hate him bitterly. He
got the idea in his sodden mind that
there was too much Johnson in the
negotiations, and determined upon
Johnson's destruction. He prepared for
the crime deliberately, notifying John
son to attend upon him at a certain
hour In the afternoon. As the hour
approached the earl managed to send
everybody away from the place, with
the exception of two or three maid
servants. Johnson appeared for the
interview promptly on time, and the
earl handed him a paper and told him
to sign it. The paper was a confes
sion of all sorts of crimes and crooked
ness on the part of Johnson, and he
refused to sign it, and began to ex
postulate, but the earl produced a pi
tol and told him to get on his knees.
Johnson fell upon his knees and then
the nobleman shot him. He lingered
until the next day, when he died.
Then the earl barricaded himself in
his ancestral hall and defied arrest.
He was armed to the teeth with pistols
and blanderbuses and other weapons.
He held off the crowd of officers and
citizens for several boars, but was
fbinlly captured while trying to make
his escape throuh a back ardena
taken t the tower of Leec
he bobered up completely,
the theory that he was
a charming man. All who
contact with him dring his
t agreed that he was just
sweet for anything. In due season
trial occurred, and he conducted
own defense, introducing a great
of testimony calculated to show
he was insane when the crime
committed. There were no pro
oalona allienists in those days, and
his showing didn't make much of an
kmpresslon upon the jury. He was
',and guilty of willful murder and sen
tapeed to be hanged and then turned
vere to the college of surgeons for dis
section. This little matter being set
tied, he expressed regret that he had
tried to prove himself insane. He did
It by the advice of friends, he said.
Had his defense resulted in acquit
tal, he'd have been greatly ashamed
and embarrassed.
On the morning of May 5, 1700 the
sheriffs of London and Middlesex
made a formal call at the tower of
London and demanded the body of
Laurence Earl Ferrers for execution.
His lordship, being informed of it,
asked that he might ride to the gal
lows in his own landau, and this was
granted. "We strive to please" was
the motto of the sheriffs of London
and Middlesex. His lordship came
from his cell, cool, intrepid, suave, at
tired in his wedding suit, which was
trimmed with silver. His toilet had
been attended to with great care, and
he was a fine figure of a man.
Sheriff Valliant and another promi
nent citizen seated themselves in the
landau with him. This carriage was
drawn by six horses, and would have
been a credit to an American circus.
The grand free street parade was then
organized as follows: A large body of
constables in advance, on foot; a party
of horse grenadiers and another of in
fantry; Mr. Sheriff Errington in his
c'hariot; the landau, escorted by horse
grenadiers; private carriages; a
mourning coach drawn by six horses;
a hearse, drawn by six horses. The
calliope wasn't invented then, or there
would have been one at the end of the
procession.
The streets were absolutely packed
with humanity. All London was there
to see a real nobleman go to a felon's
death. Every few rods the procession
was halted until the grenadiers could
clear the way. So it took nearly three
hours for the pageant to reach Ty
burn. Meanwhile his lordship sat in
the landau as serene as though going
to a clam-bake. He discussed litera
ture, art and religion. He criticised
a new book by Lord Bollngbroke, and
recited several recent poems which
had caught his fancy. hebrE.r  i a

been done to make the scabid selm
cozy and cheerful. The timbers were
covered with black balse, and there
was a comfortable chair for his lord
ship, in case he wanted to rest. The
whole mechanism of the gallows had
been changed to make death as pleas
ant as possible. The earl ascended
the steps jauntily, gave five guineas to
the executioner, smiled cheerfully on
everybody, and died without a tremor.
During his last night on earth he tried
his hand at poetry, and produced the
following three lines:
"In doubt I lived, in doubt I die,
Yet stand prepared the vast abyss to
try,
And, undismayed, expect eternity."
