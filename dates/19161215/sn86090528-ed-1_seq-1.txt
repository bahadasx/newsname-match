Three Courses Open.
By United Press.
London, Dec. in. A Bteady increase
in the sentiment that the allies in re
"using the German puaee proposals
should set forth their own terms of
peace is manifest here.
Notwithstanding the continued ill
ness of Premier Lloyd-George, the al
lied nations have already begun an
exchange of their views on the Teu
tonic peace proposals. Three views
are entertained as to the course which
the allies should take in answering the
German note and avoiding Teutonic
pitfalls.
, The first suggestion is that the note
should bo bluntly rejected.
The second plan is that Germany
should be asked to name her terms, on
the assumption that they a're worth
considering.
The third idea, brought forward is
that the allies should riot ask for Ger
many's terms but should state their
own in detail. "

Faithful Gray Team of Fire Department,
Now Out of Job,' Will Cet Sinecure
from City
The fate of the two gray fire horses
that have been relieved from active
duty by tho purchase of the $9,000 mo
tor fire truck was sealed last night
whon, upon receipt by the city coun
cil of a petition signed by hundreds of
Chickasha women through their re
ligious and civic societies, both Mayor
Coffman and tho council declared
their policy regarding these faithful
servitors.
It had been the intention or the city
officials at all time sinco the begin
ning of the negotiations for the motor
truck, to provide well for the old gray
team which for eleven y .rs had done
yeoman service tor tho department,
most of the time hauling the fire en
gine to danger spots. However, the
Impression gained ground that, on re
lieving the pair for duty, the city
would farm them out to some enter
prising contractor for the feed. This
wa3 not true, but it had the effect of
producing the following recommenda
tion on tha part of Chickasha lar'iej,
the petition having been filed yester
day afternoon with the city clerk to
be read last night ai the meeting:
Whereas, the City of Chickasha is
the owner of two horses, eighteen and
twenty years old, respectively, which
said horses have rendered long and
faithful service to tho fire department
or said city; and,
Whereas, since the purchase of the
motor truck by said , city it is pro
posed that some disposition be made
of said horses;
Now, Therefore, We, the undersigned
organization of the city of Chickasha,
do hereby respectively petition the
city council of said city in making dis
position of said horses to so provide
that said horses will only be subjected
to light work and that some provision
bemade for the welfare of said hors
es so long as they may live.
In presenting this petition we feel
that said horses have rendered to said
city their full value, and are now en
titled to spend their last ilays free
from abuse or severe work,

Mayor Coffman this morning made
the following statement regarding the
future of the old grays:
"While we all commend the ladies
for the kindly and humane interest
which they have taken in the old gray
horses; you may say that it has nev
er been our intention to turn them
loose to anybody who would not take
the best of care of them. On the con
trary they will he given good homes
and tho best of attention, and in re
turn will do their part' in helping to
make of Chickasha the cleanest city
in the state. We will give them three
good meals a day, a warm home and
just enough work hauling trash to
keep them In good condition. They
will be attached to the rubbish wagon
with light work and in charge of a
mail who will take good care of them.
A better fate they could not ask If
they could speak, and they can al
most do that."
The horses were purchased by tht
city on July 11. 1905, and are sixteen
and seventeen years old, respectively.

VOLNEY GRAY
NORTH TO
Volney L. Gray, known throughout
the length and breadth of Alaska as
"Slim" Gray, though the reason for
this cognomen is not apparent when
one sizes up his six feet of hardy man
hood, after spending many years in
the frozen north has concluded to re
turn to the land of his first Joye and
will try farming in Grady county and
make his home in Chickasha.
M". Gray Is now the guest of his
father, O. J. Gray, and will try raising
cotton instead of nuggets or frozen
mail matter. He tells an interesting
tale of conditions prevailing 'In Alas
ka, how great fortunes were made in
.the early days of the gold excitement
and how the Americans are now set
tling down on farms of from five acres
down, for five acres of cleared land
was the largest tract he saw In that
rapidly growing territory:
Mr. Gray went from here to Alaska
in 1902, goir.g to Valdez and the Cop
per river country, putting iii the first
ten winters in that section of Alaska,
returning here in 1912. In 1913 he
returned to that country with the gov
ernment expedition, going to the Ma
tanuska coal fields through which the
American government is now operat
ing a railroad. This expedition was
sent there to mine 1.000 tons of coal
to bo used as a test for their navy de
partment. To reach these fields one
goes first to tho government's railroad
terminus at Anchorage at Cook's In
let. They have their road practically
finished now from Anchorage to the
coal fields. He went to Anchorage
when the government first started op
erations there in the spring of 1915,
having visited in Chickasha that win
ter. '
"Last winter I had a small contract
hauling mail from Seward to Anchor
age," he said, "the latter being a clos
ed port In the winter and having no
ships from November till he latU'r
part of April."
Mr. Gray remained at Anchorage just
long enough to vote and helped to
elect Alaska's first Democratic dele
gate to congress by 54 votes in the
whole territory. This was a close con
test in a district In which there were
35,000 Americans ami included wo
men's suffrage.

LIVE IN CHICKASHA
big placer fields are beginning to be
worked out and the people are paying
more attention now to quartz mining.
The railroad Is opening up a new min
ing and agricultural district that has
never before been exploited.
Big Money in Potatoes.
"The engineering commission has
this fall purchased 700 tons of pota
toes from the farmers in the Matanus
ka valley, allowing them the same
price that it cost them to get the pota
toes shipped in from the states, about
$43.00 per ton. Tho largest farm that
I saw that was cleared up was about
five acres, a truck farm. The (armors,
however, are moving right into the
jungles and crowding tho moose back
into the mountains, Tho land produc
es about ten tons of potatoes to the
acre and they are beginning lo expo
rlmont with such gialn as wheat, bar
ley and oats, and think they will be
able to raise small grain with profit
later on.
$500 an Acre to Ctea.
"Up until this year homesteaders
were allowed up to 320 acres of land
and then it was cut down to 100 acres.
Owing to the heavy timber on tho land
the people have not yet been able to
get any largo tracts cleared up, which
accounts for tho small farms up to this
time. It costs about $500 to clear an
acre in that country."
New Mining Country.
"Tho railroad is opening up new min
ing districts, among them the Willow
Creek district about sixty miles from
Anchorage, That camp now has about
five stamp mills in operation each of
which paid a good dividend this year.
When the railroad reaches the Broad
Pass country that will open up a won

that has never been touched. After
going through Broad Pass beyond the
Nenana river they will reach flie Ne

nal will be Fairbanks on the Tanana

"This railroad when completed will
be about 500 miles long. The town of
Anchorage had nbout 0,000 people
