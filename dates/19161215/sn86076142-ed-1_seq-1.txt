GERMANY IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL
DISARMAMENT
PLAN FOR
AS PART OF THE
A PERMANENT PEACE
WASHINGTON. Dec 15. The Ger
man embassy last night authorized
(he statement that it was certain,
should representatives of the bellig
erents meet to discuss peace terms,
that one of the most important sub
jects for discussion would be that of
universal or limited disarmament.
The German view la Bald to be
that any peace would be worthless
which did not make unnecessary
armament on a scale approaching
that which existed before the war.
It was suggested that actual forma
tion, as fca boon proposed In some
league of nations to enforce peace,
necessarily would have the effect to
bring about a limited armament.
The German chancellor has said
Germany would be glad to enter a
league to prevent war. The German
view further Is indicated as being
generally opposed to international
coalitions, as such have existed in
the past, on the ground that such
coalitions are antagonistic to the
maintenance of peace, rather than
conducive to it.

down in value today on account of
peace reimrts. The first sales showed
a fall In some cases of 8 cents a
bushel. Waves of selling accom
panied the exciting break. The break
was due to the German embassy's
statement referring to limitation of
armament and also to breaks in the
New York stock market.
Within one hour the losses widened
to 10 cents a bushel. The market
has fallen down over 45 cents a
bushel In the December option, com
pared with the price of a month ago.

This was the outcome of a cabinet

LONDON, Dec 15. The Greek
government has accepted the ultl
matum of the entente, gays an Athens
dispatch to the Central Newi agency,
account and to safeguard our own
interests, to approach the combatants
as a mutual friend and open negotia
tions with a view to the re-establishment
of normal international condl-,
tions. , -
"Our relations to the combat are
such, and our interests are so in
volved, that I think we have a right
to apeak, a right as clear as . to
entitle us to speak wlLvut asking
and without Just offense. We would
not speak Impertinently as lnter-
meddlers, but as a friend who suf
fered grievously and Innocently from
the ruthless acts of war."
The senator declared he wished it
distinctly understood that he spoke
on his own personal responsibility,
but said he later might speak "in
another forum" on whether any neu
tral or group of neutrals should "at
tempt any affirmative action to end
the present war." He said he would
not discuss the wisdom or unwisdom
of an approach of the belligerents
with peace proposals, but merely of
the propriety of the right," and point
ed out that distinguished In this
country and In the warring countries
have warned that such a movement
would not only be futile but offensive.
"I am not disposed," he added, "to
accept without questioning either the
accuracy of these statements or the
soundness of the reasons on which
they are predicated. Two families
with a feud between them might so
long as they kept peace and observed
the law, resent any effort of an out
sider to harmonize them; but if they
should break forth into open war, so
as to disturb the general peace and
visit universal harm upon the whole
neighborhood, the law-abiding mem
bers of the community would have a
right to call a halt without being
guilty of Impertinence. Why should
not the same rule apply morally and
legally to the family of nations?"

STATE EXECUTIVES
The president attaches much Im
portance to the possibility of estab
lishing an association of nations to
maintain peace.
With the apparent moderating; of
that first attitude, as reflected in
the British newspapers and among
the entente allied diplomats here),
the way seems easier for the presi
dent to express In some vy the
hope ot the U. S. that the proposal
for a discussion ot peace will not be '
rejected without consideration. In
such a step there is a likelihood, of
the U. S. being supported by some)
of the European neutrals. .
The change in the attitude of the
entente embassies, however, was re
garded as the most Interesting de
velopment pointing to the probable
position of the allies. It was indi
cated that to avoid being placed la
the position of flatly rejecting peace)
overtures, without knowing what Is
proposed, It was not improbable that
after mature deliberation among
themselves the allies, would make
preliminary inquiries upon which dis
cussion was discussed. , Such action
