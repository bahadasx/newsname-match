RUSSIAN ATTITUDE
' ? i ON PEACE PROPOSAL
Declare Offer Was Made to Placate
People jilMGermany.
Petrograd, via-London,' Dec. 14, 9.15
p. m. The following semi-official
statement regarding the Russian at
titude on the peace proposal has been
issued by the Petrograd News Agen
cy: - ... "
- "The new appeal of our enemies is
not their icst attempt to .throw upon
the entente powers the ' responsibility
for. the war they let loose. In order
to obtain the support of the German
peoples, who are tired or the war, the
Berlin government many times has
had recourse to fallacious words of
peace and has f reqently, in order to
animate its troops, offered prospects
of a nearly ipeace. It promised peace
when Warsaw was taken, when Ser
bia was. conquered, forgetting ' that
such promises unfulfilled would create
profound; distrust. ,
"In its further efforts, which are
similarly due to the same interested
consideration! the German govern
tnent is obliged to carry this question
outside of Germany. ' All "the world
recalls these attempts, notably, its
Ballons d'essai, which were sent up in
neutral countries, particularly the
United States. '". -
'Seeing the inanity of such methods,
which deceived nobody, Germany at
tempted to create a peace atmosphere,
which would allow her to consolidate
her aggressive and. imperialistic ten
dencies. while sowing discord between
the allies by seeking to make puimc
opinion believe that separate pourpar-
lers were in progress between her i.nd
the entente powers. There were also
persistent reports of a separate peace.
In -view of the fact, however,, that the
allies with strong unanimity, rejected
all these attempts, our enemies had to
think or a more serious plan.

FEDERAL INDEX SYSTEM
FOR VITAL STATISTICS
Urged by Kentucky State Registrar
To Prevent Mixed Marriages.
Laouisville. Ky., Dec. '14. Laxness
in the registration of negro births

statement of W. L. Heiser, state rear
istrar of vital statistics, made before

Mr Heiser . called it a real peril in
Kentucky and asserted the number of
quadtoons and octoroons in other por
tions of the country as well who
could not be distinguished from white
persons was considerable. He recom
mended that registrars take greater
care in accurately fixing of record the
racial status of their progeny for tho
protection of future white generations
and urged compulsory registration of
vital statistics for the whole nation
under , a card index system supervised
by the Iedera government. ,,.

this bill Senator Underwood has pro
posed a referendum to the male voters
of the district. Senator Kern of Indi
ana has added a proposal that women
also should participate in the referen
dum.
Sentiment In the senate for and
against the referendum appears to be
closely divided, with a vote on the
subiect expected within a day or two.

forded opportunity for comment on the
proposed amendment, several senators.
among them Sheppard, Vardaman and
Owen, predicting triumph for the cause
of nation-wide prohibition in the near

Seven members of the judiciary com
mittee voted against reporting the
prohibition amendment. They were
