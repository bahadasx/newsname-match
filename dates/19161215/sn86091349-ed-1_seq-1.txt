Atlanta Gold Mine
Showing Bio

Resources
The Atlanta Home Cold Mining
company, operating at Atlanta, lias
been making some very important
developments In Its property lately,
and the management has announced
that there is no question about con
struction of a large mill at the mine
iluring the coming year.
The late developments consist of
opening the ore bodies on the 4 00
foot level which gives the company
an available asset of at least 1,000,-
cidedly better values said to be
around $12 a ton. This being the
case, the officers of the company have
reason to feel Jubilant over the out
look for the future. Cross-cuttinz
is in progress on the 400-level, and
at the same a drift on the ore body
is being run to correspond with the
work done on the upper levels. The
company is going to continue the
shaft on to the 500-level without de
lay. The Atlanta mine has proved to
000 tons and which is estimated to be a big low grade gold proposition
be worth $5 a ton, or $5,000,000. land no doubt during the coming
It is reported, however, that the year the camp 47 miles north of Pi
ore found on the 400-level shows de- oche will teem with activity.
YELLOW PINK PAYS
CHRISTMAS DIVIDEND
The directors of the Yellow Vine
Mining company have declared a div
idend for December of ten cents per
share of its capitalization of $1,000,
000. This brings its total dividends
for the year 1916 to the stupendous
amount of $800,000 or Just $200,000
less than its entire capitalization.
The actual amount of cash repre
sented in the capitalization la prob
lematical, as the treasury stock of the
company sold all the way from five
to 50 cents a share. The treasury
stock was sold out when the price
was fifty cents. If figured out on the
actual ampunt of cash received by
the company for mine development
and operation from the sale of its
treasury stock this dividend would
mean that It has paid from 200 to
300 per cent in one year for all the
cash actually involved.
The physical condition of tho mine
was never better. Thereis more ore
In sight right now than can be ex
tracted in a year. As depth is at
tained in its immense working, big
ger and better ore shoots are un
covered, until it looks as if the whole
ground of the company was a gigant
is chimney, similar to the United
Verde in Arizona and El Potosi pipe
in Chihuahua. There seems to be no
limit to the extent of ore production.
Yet the stock of this company is be
ing sold on the Los Angeles Stock
exchange for the miserable sum of
$1.65 per share, while stocks in com
panies in Utah, Idaho and Montana,
producing no more, and paying less
dividends, are freely quoted on their
exchanges at from $8 to $12 per
share. Goodsprings Gazette.
