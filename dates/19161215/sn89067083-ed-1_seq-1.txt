Rome. One of the atorle of hero
Ism and bravery that Is ou everyone's
lips Is of Sub-Lieutenant Uaruzzl, a
modest young man, nineteen wears old,
who ha been awarded the gold medal
for valor. With only three men he
captured an Austrian detachment of
foar officers- and 200 soldiers In
trenched under a railroad bridge, and
afterward he entered Uorits end hoist
ed the first Italian flag over the city. -
All attempts to Interview. Lieuten
ant Baruzzl and make him tell his own
story proved fruitless. Like all real
heroes he Is very modest, and when
asked for an Interview he replied that
be was very busy and, besldos, he had
nothing to say. A general finally came
to the rescue of the newspaper men.
He Invited the lieutenant to dinner and
made him talk for the benefit of the
public. . This Is the story Lieutenant
Baruul told the general : . I
' "I was out of the lines In command
of a patrol of three men, and I discov
ered that an 'Austrian detachment was
barricaded under the railroad, bridge
close to the Isonxo. ' The Austrians
were In a sort of tunnel, the entrance
of which was protected with sandbags
and timber. Our guns were firing all
ovor the place. I decided to enter the
tunnel, and went in, pistol in band,
shouting 'Surrender !' I ordered my
three men to cover the officer with
their LrljBcs. telling JLcinthnLn. Asm-
would not show any fight And, la fact,
that Is exactly what happened.
8ends for Help. j ,
"Civ minutes passed and I was
thinking to myself that It was Impossi
ble to get the Austrian out. We dis
armed the officers and got them out,
and I sent on of my three men to our
lines to report that we had captured
200 Austrians and needed re-enforcements.
The man went to our line and
came back on-his hands and knees,
crawling to escape oar fire, and report
ed that re-enforcements could not be
sent before the artillery had , ceased
fire. We waited for a good bit; and I
had to shout at the Austrians the wholo
Hme to keep them still. Finally the re
enforcements arrived and took the
whole lot prisoners. ' i
'f strolled toward the Isonso and
saw some men uuder, cover.' 'Do you
waat to eome with met' I asked then.
They wanted to know where to. and
when I said Qortts, of course, they re
plied that the Austrians word firing
ngnlnst'the bridge and that it was Im
possible to' cross It; 1 know tliat,' 1
sold, "but come along all the same.
We'll run for It and get to Corlta all
right.' -
"The soldier hesitated just for an
Instant, bnt seeing that I was running
toward the bridge they followed me
shouting at the top of their voices;
To Ooritxl To Go5Ul' W Crossed
the bridge on the run and got Into the
city. It was empty.' Some Austrians
were coming toward us. 1 halted took
out tny camera and snapped at, them.
They evidently thought It was a bomb
or something - like It, because .they
raised their arms and surrendered. ,.,
. '- , Waves Flag on Roof.
"Ws went on until we reached the
railroad station. Here I got on the roof
and waved the Italian flag I had with
me in the direction of our line beyond
the Isoiuo. I knew at once that my
flag had been seen, because I could
hear .the men cheering loud and long.
Mled the flag to a polo and left it
there, and when 1 got down from the
roof the first detachment of Italian
troops were rushing at the double to
ward the city, ' which they entered
shortly afterward."
The flag that Lieutenant Barazsl
hoisted over Gorlts was not larger than
an ordinary pocket handkerchief, but
It was sufficient to provoke the cheer
of the men waiting beyond -the river,
and undoubtedly hastened their ad
vance and entry Into the city.
