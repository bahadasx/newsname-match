, y' i -CATTLE SOLD WELL
-' The Holsteln cattle gale held at
the Palace Livery bara Saturday was
'well attended and the stock brought
good prices on an average. Seven ty
iz head of registered and high-grade
"cattle were sold from 4:16 till dark,
and the prices ranged from $75 to
1160 per head. The sale was con
ducted by Dlckerson and Barmore,
the, famous auctioneers, and the
' prices obtained for the stock is proof
-that they -were up to - their' usual
standard on the block. About 160
buyers were present at the sale.
"' The farmers of Seward county are
"beginning- to learn that it pays to
keep only high grade livestock on the
farms, and 'the attendance at the
ale and prices. paid for this stock
shews interest is beiug manifested
"by them in improving the breeds of
their stock. No intelligent farmer of
today would think of using inferior
seed for his crops and expect to get1
.good results, neither pan he use a
poor grade of livestock and expect to
get top prices when he brings it to
.market.
HOG BALE A SUCCESS -
f
.The public sale of Duroc-Jersey
"hogs by Lusk & Lusk held in Liberal
Saturday was a success in every way.
He price received, varied from $16
to $52. Mr. Lusk had eight' 40-
' ponnd pigs that sold for $20 each,
and the brood sows averaged $42.60
each. The average for the entire
lerd of 60 hogs was $25.35 per head,
"which 1b a mighty good price for a
bunch of hogs to bring anywhere ex-
cept in a hog country. Buying ' a
good grade of hogs and then feeding
your crops to them Is a mighty safe
policy for any farmer.; The market
price of wheat and other cereals
fluctuates so rapidly that the selling
of grain is each year more, or less of
a gamble, but the hog and cattle
market has been good and the price!
steady for a number of years, hence
the best way to market a crop, in our
opinion, is to drive or haul it to town
on foot. Mr. Lusk devotes a good
deal of 'attention" to the raising of
hogs and holds a sale of his best
stuff every fall.' He has found it a
Tery profitable side line from a finan
cial standpoint, to say nothing of the
benefit conferred on the farmers
around here in helping them to get
their farms stocked up with a good
breed of hogs.

IiOLIX-UALL ELEVATOR BURNS
:,. Flrt, broke oU In Jlhe Boltn.-JUll
elevator yesterday morning about 9
o'clock and by the time the depart
ment could get there, about three
minutes after the alarm was turned
in, the entire driveway and that side
of the building were a roaring turn
ace. Realizing the futility of wast
ing water on that Are, the boys devot
ed their attention to the VIckers ele
vatoij located a few steps east of the
Boiin-Haii, and saved it. This was
the largest fire Liberal has had since
the fire lighting apparatus has been
in use. and it is claimed to be the
largest since the depot burned sever
al years ago. The fire is of doubtful
origin but is thought to have started
in the engine room. About ten
thousand bushels of wheat and some
other grain was in the elevator and
will be almost a total loss. The
building burned furiously for over an
hour. A large crowd was soon on
hand to watch the building go up In
smoke. We failed to learn the
amount of Insurance carried on either
building or grain.
MARRIKD
, Vernon Young, who came here
about four months ago to hold down
the third trick at the Western Union
office in the freight depot, and Miss
Rhetta Downs, who has been assist
ing Miss Carson at the up-town office
of the same company, were married
by Rev. MacLennan at the Presby
terian manse Sunday at 7:30 p. m.
The newlyweds left Monday for Kan
sas City to spend a week on their
wedding trip after which they will
return and establish their home in
Liberal. Both will hold their posi
tions with the Western Union after
their return. Mr. and Mrs. Young
are a couple of fine young people and
The Democrat extends its cougratula
tions to them on their marriage.
FIRE AT OXFORD CAFE '
The fire whistle sounded Monday
night about 11 o'clock and the de
partment was called to the Oxford
Cafe on North Kansas avenue, the in
terior of which was found to be a
mass of flames. The cafe doesn't
keep open all night and had closed up
for the night about an hour before
the fire was discovered. The fire was
first seen coming from the roof , near
the chimney, and it is thought to
have been started by a defective flue.
The contents are practically a total
loss, and the Interior Is so badly
charred that the building will prac
tically have to be rebuilt before it can
be used again. We' understand the
loss on both building and contents is
partially covered by insurance.
LOSES WIFE AND CHILD
Editor Roddy of the Hooker Ad-
Vance loBt his wife and child by death
early Monday morning. They were
married about a year ago and the
double loss will be a hard one Indeed
for Frank to stand. - It Was the
writer's pleasure to know Mrs. R6ddy
since she was a small girl going to
school, and the future seemed to
hold great promise for her and hus
band. Funeral services were held at
Hooker Tuesday afternoon. The
Democrat extends the hand of sin
cere fraternal sympathy to Editor
Roddy In his great loss.
A. F. EDDIXGTON DEAD
Albert P. Eddington, who has been
suffering from cancer for several
months, died yesterday morning at
his home on North Sherman avenue.
Owing to the lateness of the hour, we
are unable to get the particulars for
this issue, but will have them for
next week. Funeral services will be
held this afternoon at the Methodist
church and interment will be made
iu the Liberal cemetery.

peka Friday, December 15, at which
time Ex-President William Howard
Taft will address the delegates of the

force Peace. Mr. Millman expects to

ciates the recognition.
The League to Enforce Peace was
organized in Independence Hall, Phil
adelphia, June 17, 1915. Its objects
re set forth in the following pro
posals: We believe It to be desirable for
the United States to Jotn a league of
nations binding the signatories to the
following:
First: AH justiciable questions
arising between the signatory powers,
not settled by negotiation, shall, sub
ject to the limitations of treaties, be
submitted to a judicial tribunal for
hearing and Judgment, both upon the
merits and upon any Issue as to its
Jurisdiction of the question.
Second: All other questions aris
ing between the signatories and not
settled by negotiation, shall be sub
mitted to a council for hearing, con
sideration and recommendation.
Third: The signatory powers shall
jointly use forthwith both their eco
nomical and military forces against
any one of their number that goes
to war, or commits acts of hostility,
against another of the signatories be-,
fore any question arising shall be
1 niihmltted as provided In the forego-
The following Interpretation Of
Article 3 has been authorized by the ,
Executive Committee:
"The signatory powers shall joint
ly use, forthwith, their economic
forces against any of their number
that refuses to submit any question
which arises to an International ju
dicial tribunal or council of concilia
tion before issuing an ultimatum or :
threatening They, shall follow ',
'this by the joint use of their military
1 forces against that nation if it actu
ally proceeds to make war or invades
another's territory."
Fourth: Conferences between the
signatory powers shall be held from
time to time to formulate and codify
rules of international law, which, un
less some signatory shall signify its
dissent within a stated period, shall
thereafter govern in the decisions of
the Judicial Tribunal mentioned in
Article One. , .. " J
CALLED OFF POULTRY HHOW
The Poultry Show, which was to
have been held Just after Christmas,,
was called off 011 account of there be
ing no suitable building available in
which to hold the show. We hope
that by next year Liberal will have
an Auditorium in which to hold this
sort of functions. They are not only
valuable to the town but also help
materially in developing the various
Industries In the country.
