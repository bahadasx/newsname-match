gress to prohibit the use of the mails
for the sending of liquor advertise
ments by unlicensed liquor dealers.
An effort is being made to have such
a provision Included in the current
postoffloe bill.
The vote on the suffrage proposal
was 11 to 8. The resolution by Rep
resentative Baker would submit the
several Husan H. .Anthony amend
ments to the states.
Chairman Webb of the committee
said he would not ask for a rule on
the prohibition resolution until after
the Christmas recess. He will not ask
for any action on the suffrage pro
posal. Representative Oard of Ohio,
who has been opposed (,i suffrage, was
chosen to report it. Representative
Carlin of Virginia, will report the pro
hition proposal.
Would Settle Suffrage Measure.
The reporting of the suffrage pro
posal was due to the belief of some
of its opponents that il can be beaten
on the floor and they thought It best
to settle the issue by bringing It to a
direct vote In the house.
An effort was made to couple it in
the voting as was done at the last ses
sion of congress and which resulted In
both proposals being kept in the com
mittee and consideration of them post
poned indefinitely. The committee by
a large majority, however, voted not
to do so.
suffragists Alt' Surprised.
The reporting of the suffrage
amendment was a surprise to Its sup
porters. The designation of Repre
sentative Walsh of Massachusetts, an
antl-snffragist, to succeed Representa
tive Mos.s of West Virginia, as a mem
ber of the committee a tew days ago,
was generally believed by many suf
frage leaders to have dealt a death
blow to their chances of having any
sort of a suffrage resolution reported
