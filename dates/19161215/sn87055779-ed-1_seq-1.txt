I r tei national Nows Service:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1.". The old
'.ai in the senate between the Old
Guard arid the progressives for con
trol of the republican party has
broken out again in an intensity
livalling the violence of the
revolution. The armed truce of the
last two years is ended. Each side
is blaming the other for Jhe repub
lican defeat in November and the
whir of the grindstone sharpening
the avenging cutlasses for an open
declaration of war was heard in
both camps today.
i in.' progressive group in the sen
ate is determined that the old
guard leadership. the Gallinger-Smoot-Penrose
triumvirate. must
go. The old guard is equally de
termined to stay. The progress
clique showed its temper yesterday
when it supported Sen. Moses G.
Clapp of Minnesota, for president
pro teui of the senate against Sen.
Gallinger. the regular republican'
leader.
Lil dlette N Ijcsulor.
Yesterday's progressive mutiny
was led by Sen. LaFollette of Wis
consin. He vas joined by Sens.
Tbtrah f Idaho. Kenyon and Cum
mins of Iowa, and Nort is of Nebras
ka. They hadn't been consulted by
the old guard when certain minor
committee appointments were made
tecently anil the election of the
president pro teni gave them their
first opportunity for revenge.
The live mutineers are almost cer
lain to get the support of Sens.
Poindexter of Washington and
Washington., arid Gtonna of North
Dakota. In the next session, they
will get a new and powerful ally in
the person of Sen. -elect Hiram John
son of California.
Platform (ihm Out.
This is the progressiv' senators'
platform, as given todav bv 'one of
the revolting clique:
I r . . . L i r . . . . I
o'ikhx oeieai was larct-rj. due to
irreconcilable progressives, who re
fused to vote the republican ticket
localise they feared it would put
control of th national government
hack in the hands of the reaction
aries against whom the 1912 revolt
'was directed. To win in l'J20 the
republican leadership must he re
constructed The republican party
ran never expect to win hack- the
progressives as long as it keeps the
r 'illingers. Smoots. and Penroses in
power. The voters f the west ex
pressed their aversion to this sort of
leadership in November and they
will continue to do so as long as
uch leadership is maintained. The
time to t.ein ousting the old guard,
which cost us the election, is now!
The old guard must go.

PROCEDURE OF i
Gill COURT IS
FOUND FAULTY
Both Judges, Ford and Funk,
Declare All Appeal Bonds
Must be Signed by Judge
of Lower Court.
TWO APPEALS DISMISSED
ON CITY'S CONTENTION
Custom of City Clerk Signing
Transcripts and Bonds
Has Been in Force For
Twelve Years.
Change in the city court pro
cedure in granting appeals to the
two higher courts of the county,
which has been in force for about
12 years, will have to be made as
the result of decisions that have
been rendered by Judge Walter A.
Funk of circu't court, and Judge
George Ford ot superior court.
Both of the court have held that
transcripts and Bonds in appeal
cases that are approved by the city
lerk rather than the city judge are
oid.
Judge Eord'st decision to this ef
fect was made Thursday afternoon
in the case of the City of South
Rend vs David Fetters, who appeal
ed to the superior couri. when he
was found guilty of violafing a traf
lic ordinance by Judge Herbert 1).
Warner in police court last June.
Both the transcript and the appeal
bond were held to be void by the
judge on the ground that Judge
"Warner had not approved either of
them.
Fetters was accused of failing to
obey the signal of the traffic police
man at the . corner of Washington
a. v. and Main st. He was fined $1
and costs and immediately iiled an
appeal bond ot $100. When the at
torneys in the case came before
Judge Ford to argue the issues in
the case, City Atty. Eli F. Seebirt
raised the juestion of the validity
of the bond and the transcript. Ac
cording to Mr. eebirt the lirst de
cision rendering bonds and trans
cripts void unless they were signed
by the city judge was given by a
court in central Indiana.
Judge .Must Sign Papers.
In arguing the point to Judge
Ford, the city attorney showed that
according to Burn.-:' revised statutes,
the transcript and bond in an ap
peal from a city court must be ap
proved in the same manner as in an
appeal from a justice of the peace
court. He said that when an appeal
was taken from a justice court, the
justice of the peace was required to
approve the bond and transcript
and that the two papers In an ap
peal from a city court must be sign
ed by the judge of the court and not
by the city clerk.
Attorneys said Friday that the
custom of the city clerk signing the
papers in appeal cases had been in
force in the South Lend city court
for years and that no objection to
the procedure ever had been raised
before. With the judges of the two
highest courts in the county hold
ing the same way in regard to the
matter, it will be necessary for the
judge of the city court to sign his
name to the papers raider than al
lowing the clerk to do it.
Judge Funk's ruling in the mat
ter was given in the ca.-e of the
City of South Tend vs. Israel T.
Glaser, who was charged with con
ducting a livery stable in the resi
dence district, in violation of a city
ordinance. Glaser was found guilty
and appealed to the circuit court.
The appeal was dismissed on thn
motion of City Atty. .eebirt on the
same grounds.
Although the decisions of both of
the judges were made on cases in
volving violation of city ordinanc -s.
which come under the legal head of
civil suits. Mr. Seebirt contends th tt
the same rule will affect criminal
cases. He said Friday morning that
the class of the case would have no
effect on the ruling in regard to
bonds and transcripts.
Jn (lisirussing the new rulings Fri
day morning. several attorneys
raised the question as to the forfeit
of the bond on w hich the offender is
released pending the hearing- of the
pppeal in the higher court. One of
them contended that the I ondsman
could not be held responsible when
the higher court refused to accept
the bond when it was not approved
by the proper authority.
About nine cases will have to be
dismissed here because of the rul
ings of the higher courts. Only "0
days are allowed for the perfec
tion of appeals and in all of the
iTpeals that are now pending in the
circuit and sujierior courts the al
lotted time is up.
Fortunes Made
And Lost in the
Pits at Chicago
Ir ternatittnal News Kervire:
CHICAGO, Dec. 15. The wheat
pits on the Chicago board of trade
were veritable mad houses today.
Fortunes were made and fortunes
were lost in the most exciti re
market of many months.
Prices broke sharply at the open
ing on reports that the allies would
state terms of peace in response to
Germany's offer. Starting with a
loss of r, 4 to 6 'h, May futures drop
ped steadily and before noon had
reached a loss of 12 i cents,
the most sensational decline since
wheat started its climb toward the
$2 mark. Futures for other months
lost from to 7 cents in the first
two hours of trading.
Crowds thronged the galleries as
the roar of excited bidding spread
to the streets.
There were reports that grain
men had received advices from
Montreal, saying agents were con
tracting there for German made
goods with assurances that delivery
could be maU in the spring, indl
eating Germany's belief in an early
peace.

E
Will Continue Efforts to End
War Though Allies Refuse
to Consider Terms.
International N'crs Service:
BE It LIN, Dec. 15. Even should
the allies reject Germany's peace i
proposals without an interchange of i
ideas Germany will continue her
efforts to end the conflagration
which is desolating Kurope, accord
in? to an opinion expressed in high
political circles today.
The fact that Germany said noth
ing about terms in the proposals is
held in some quarters as an inten
tional omission, the object being; to
give the allies an opportunity to ex
change notes- on the subject.
The terms Germany is willing to
offer are not known to the people.
but from all indications they
are
believed to he moderate.
There is good ground for the
belief that the question of limiting
armaments will enter largely into
the conversations if a peace confer
ence can be brought about. l.ut
that is only one of the big problems.
Concisely they might he grouped as
follows:
V Restoration of lost territory.
2. Indemnities.
Limitation of armaments.
4. Commercial freedom.
Germany, it is declared, is pre
ured to make equal concessions
with the allied nations in the mat
ter of disarmament. She is espiee -
allv anxious to show that militarism
is not the dominant spirit animating
the German empire.

may lead to tangible results.
