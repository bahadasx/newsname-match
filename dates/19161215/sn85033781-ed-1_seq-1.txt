IMPORTANT BERTH
D. G. Watson to be Kala
mazoo Manager of
Bell Telephone.
TWELVE YEARS WITH KIBBIE
Started in as Trouble Man
and was Promoted to
Dist. Manager.
Paw Paw loses another one of it3
splendid citizens. Dwight G. Watson
the genial local manager of the Van
Buren Telephone company has accept
ed a position as manager af the Kala
mazoo branch of the Bell Telephone
company, and will assume his duties
in the new field next Monday.
Mr. Watson is a Van Buren county
boy, born and raised here. He at
tended the schools, and grew to man
hood in this locality. Later he ;u
cepted a position with Swift and Co.,
in Chicago, leaving there twelve years
ago to accept a position as "Trouble
Man" foi the Kibbie Telephone com
pany. This was really the beginning
of a career which has won for him the
responsible position he now accepts.
His courteous and obliging ways, and
his close application to business were
.soon rewarded by a promotion, and
for the past five years he has been
iistrict manager for the Van Buren
county Telephone company. His
territory comprising Taw Paw, Law
ton and Decatur. It will be a blow
to the local company to lose him, but
he starts in a better position there
than it would ever be possible to reach
here, and those who know him best
are confident of his success. He will
be on the job to win. v
it is probable that Miss Kathryn
mazoo next Monday, his family will
remain in Paw Paw at least until
Spring. It is not known who will
succeed him in the local exchange, but
it is probable that Miss Katherine
Smith who has been the efficient chief
operator for a number of years, and
who is thoroughly competent, will be
placed in charge for the present.
That would seem to be the logical sol
ution both in the interest of the com
pany and its patrons.
The Telephone company is doing
everything in its power to give its
patrons the best possible service. We
are informed that an effort is being
made right now, to reach some agree
ment whereby there may be an ex
change of service among the various
companies doing business in this coun
ty. This would eliminate the neces
sity of two phones in many places
and would meet the approval of
everybody.
PUPIL OF MR. SHELDON
The Dowagiac Daily News in com
menting on the O. H. P. Sheldon story
in last weeks issue of The True
Northerner says in part:
"In the early days Mr. Sheldon
taught school in a little red school
house near the present Steeple
schoolhouse east of Paw Paw, and
sixty-one years ago A. M. Moon of
this city was one of hispupils. He
never went to a better teacher and
still remembers with the livliest
pleasure his kindly care for his pupils
his unfailing patience and good citi
zenship." BIRNEY BROS. SELL
HOTEL TO McNEIL
Tht Giddings Hotel at Law ton bai
been sold to K. W. McNeil who assum
ed his new role of Landlord last Mon
day morning. The hotel was owned
and operated for many years by the
f biddings brothers, Fred and Charley.
Some years ago they sold out to the
Birney Bros. Tim and Frank, who
have conducted the place since that
time About two years ago, the
BirneyBros. bought the Pike Hous
at Niles. Tim looked after their in
terests their and Frank remained at
Lawton. Many improvements have
been made in the Pike House, and
more are contemplated now that both
the boys can give their undivided at
tention to the one place.
CHOCOLATE SOLDIER
A HIGH CLASS SHOW
The Oxford company presented the
"Chocolate Soldier" for the second
number of the Coterie Lecture course
at the Opera house last Wednesday
evening. This was a splendid high
class company and gave a most pleas
ing entertainment. It seems to be
the universal opinion, that it was the
best company ever appearing before
a Paw Paw audience on any lecture
course. It was certainly deserving
of a packed house. If the people of
Paw Paw would only patronize the
"good things" that are brought here,
a little more liberally, it would offer
a little more encouragement to those
who work hard to insure a good lec
ture course for the winter months.
GOES TO INDIANA
Rev. Shape accepts Pastor
ate at Butler in the
Hoosier State.
Ilov. F. A. Shape has accepted I
call from the Christian church at But
ler, Indiana, and is moving his house

large and enthusiastic congregation.
M r. Shape has preached several Sun
days there, and is delighted with the
place and with the hospitable and en
thusiastic reception with which he
has been received. He is looking for
ward to a pleasant and profitable pas-
new field.
liev. and Mrs. Shape have made
many friends during their short resi
dence in Paw Paw who will regret to
lose them. They are most estimable
people and an asset to any commun
ity. Mr. Shape is a speaker of more
than ordinary ability, and a gifted
musician. He has had twenty years
experience as a pastor and evangelist,
and is a polished gentleman. He is
broad minded, knows the frailities an 1
weaknesses of humanity and is a
"man among men". He should be a

ARRESTED THEIR MAN
IN MUNCIE, INDIANA
Under sheriff Andrew Lang arrest
ed Earl Gest of Arlington last Tues
day in Muncie, Indiana and brought
him to the county jail. The young
man has been wanted since last July,
on a larceny charge. It is alleged
that while his father-in-law, Joseph
Weston also of Arlington was away,
Gest, entered the house and helped
himself to one hundred and fifty
dollars in cold cash, and disappeared.
He was working for Weston at the
time, and while he was suspected of
the crime at the time, he eluded the
officers until this week when he was
apprehended as stated above.
E A
Packed Opera House More
than Delighted with the
SchoolEntertainment
One of the finest school entertain
ments ever given in Paw Paw was
witnessed by a packed Opera house
last Friday night. The program was
given by the grades from the first to !
eighth inclusive, and there was not a
poor number from start to finish.
One noticeable feature which is wor
thy of commendation was the utter
absence of confusion both on the stage
and behind the scenes. Over one
hundred and fifty pupils took part in
the evenings entertainment, and yet
everything moved off with clock like
precision. It would be extremely
difficult to pick out a single number
that was deserving of more praise
than the others. It was a finished
entertainment from the time the little
folks came out for the first number
until the curtain went down at the
close. The teachers of the various
grades are certainly entitled to much
credit for the excellence of the drills,
and the polished manner in which
every number on the program wa.
given. The High school orchestra is
also entitled to its share of commen
dation. There has been such a mark
ed improvement in the orchestra dur
ing the present school year that one
would not recognize it as the same
organization. It reflects much credit
on the individual members, and also
on Mr. Gottheimer, the instructor and
cornetist. Nearly seventy dollars
was realized from the receipts of the
evening, and everybody was satisfied.

DINNER PARTY AT KILLEFEE'S
A company of young people were
entertained at the hospitable Kiiiefer
home last Thursday evening. "Bill"

groaned under the weight of the many
good things, prepared as only Mrs.
Killefer knows how to prepare them.
It was an event long to be remember

The following was written and
dedicated to "Jim" Warner, the genia!
book keeper at the First National

cashier was away:
Its easy enough to be pleasant
When the Book-Keeper runs the bank,
But the guy worth while, is the one
who can smile
When he breaketh his arm with a
crank.
Then all the officials worketh
Till every one's in a quiver
And they cuss and they rare
And almost they swear,
At the Book-keeper's gol darn "flirer"

S 111 NSPECTION II SUCCESS
Certified Grapes Well Re
ceived. Federal Inspect
ion Bound to Come
G. E. Prater Jr. returned from Chi
cago last week filled with enthusiasm
over the National Conference on
Marketing which he attended, and in
which he had a part in the program.
The conference of course covered all
branches of agricultural, dairy aad
fruit marketing, but Mr. Prater was
particularly interested in the fruit de
partment. The same objects are
sought however, and will eventually
be attained in all the various depart
ments of marketing.
After considerable hard work and
much agitation, Michigan got just a
sample of state inspection this year.
In this connection, it may be said that
it was largely through Mr. Prater's
efforts that real certified grapes be
came a reality this year; and also
that the first certified grapes ever
sold and shipped in the United States
came from the Wolverine co-operative
company at Paw Paw of which Mr.
Prater is manager. Certified grapes
of course was an experiment this year
As in all innovations or progressive
movements in any line, there were
many skeptics. Many who doubted
the advisability of it. But it is no
longer an experiment and the success
of the movement is now assured.
The success of state inspection has
warranted a movement toward Feder
al inspection. This may take some
time, but it is sure to come. Then
the standard of packing in Michigan
will be the same as in every other
state. A customer who buvs a "AA"
ear of certified grapes in Michigan
then, no matter what state he is
from, will know, just what the stand
ard is. This standardization of mark
eting will eventually come in all
branches of produce. This section
is especially interested in the grape
question, but other sections are talk
ing state and federal inspection for
all kinds of produce. The next ten
years will see many changes for the
benefit of both grower and consumer,
and the days of haphazard, hit and
miss packing of produce are numbered
