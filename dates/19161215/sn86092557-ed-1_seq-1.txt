No formal comment was forthcom j
I ng today either from the White llous0 i

It. is known to hi' the view of most
at the eabinei members that the
American government should move
\ cautiously and do nothing to imperil
its influence for peace.
Secretary Lansing early today held
his first personal conference with
I President Wilson since the peace proposals
of the Central powers wore
made public.
It was said the formal note from
Germany and Austria mlgut go torward
before night and necessarily in
view of probability that the President
| would take no independent action uuf
til after Lloyd-George had spoken in
Itlie House of Commons they probably
will bo accompanied only by formal
k notes of transmittal.
" The authorized statement at the :
German embassy that consideration
of at least partial disarmament would
be one of the things taken up at a
peace conference attracted the widest
| attention among government officials
[ ; and diplomats.
It was accounted a doubly interestI^S.Jcg

Not So Cold Today As Yesterday
According to

What a blowing on fingers and resurrecting
of snow shovels this morning
when the good people of Fairmont
peeked out of doors and saw that overnight
there had sit'toj down nearly
six Inches of snow?the first real snow
storm of the year. All day the snow
kept coming down and from the looks
of the clouds. Fairmont is slated for
a real old "Whitticresque" storm.
For the first time thi> v'.nter the
jingly, rag time music of tho sleighbells
was echoing everywhere, with
scores of sleighs, bob tails, and cutters
dashing about here and there.
Persons who live out in the country
piled into their sleds this morning,
anil Iieliiud Uie brisk feet of "Folly"
and "Bob" wfre whisked Into town to
do Christmas shopping.
The little Flivers wpre running
hither and yon, but the heavier automobiles
were keeping pretty much
"to hum." The streets were slippery
and icy, the hills almost impossible,
which of course was ideal Kliver conditions.
Teamsters were pretty good to their
horses today, nearly all teams which
were left standing for any length of
time being blanketed. There were a
few exceptions but the activities of
the Humane society have been such
as to instill a fear into the hearts ot
tho most brutal drivers
The weather man at Fairmont says
that the temperature this morning was
not as cold as yestcrii or tile day
before, lie gives the I, "roe of coldness
this morning as being 21) above.
Yesterday's was 14 and the day before
that. 13. The weather chief at

had better bundle up and watch
the water pipes tonight, for its going
to get lots colder.

City Hall Notes
I
Dominick Casteluci. foreman of the
city water department, was taken
home yesterday afternoon suffering
with pneumania. He had contracted
the ailment while working in water
to his waist during this present inclement
weather. Dominick has been with
the city water department for the past
16 years and since the present administration
took hold has been the foreman.
Two-thirds of Robinson street has
been paved leaving the other one-third
to await the whints of the weatherman.
No street department employees are
working at regular jobs today, the few
who are working being used to remove
the snow from the bridges and over the
sewers which aro liable to freeze up.
Monroe street will be paved when
the weather gets so that brick laying
can be done.
Finance Commissioner J. Walter
Barnes' office was the scone today of

"?:
Heaviest ot Christmas Mail
Will Come Next
Week.
Due to the "shop early" and "ship!
early" campaigns the Veal post ofiice
will not have to place additional forces
to work until Monday. Monday
there will be one additional cl?rk and
one additional parcel post wagon put
on. Each day more will be added
until about next Thursday when 10
men will have secured positions assisting
in moving the mail
Three parcel post wagons will be
added by the middel of next weok.
Signs at the post office are beginning
to indicate that there will be one of
the heaviest mails for Christmas season
known to Fairmont. At the present
time it can be sc.i that Christmas
shippers started to moving their
goods early and that on this account
it will prove not so great a congrestion
as the amount of business would
seem to indicate.
Assistant Postmaster llarry Owens
has his organization working like a
clock at present and were it fcot that j
the present post will increase fivefold
within the next few days the men
lie lias on hand ought to be able to
handle it. Boys will be. carried in to

That is the Conclusion of
Studies Made by Insurance
Companies.
(By Associated Prcs?l
NEW YORK. Dec. 15.?Two yearsstudy
of original insurance statistics
indicate cancer Is neither hereditary
nor contagious, according to a paper
presented to the Association of Life
Insurance Presidents here today hy
President Arthur Hunter, ot the Ac
tuarial Socic ty of America.
After referring to the annual toll of
eighty thousand deaths from cancer in
the United States. Mr. Hunter said:
"No sooner do we become interested
in the wide prevalence of a disease
lileo cancer, than we begin to wonder
whether it is contagious or hereditary.
Such questions must be in the minds
of hundreds of thousands of relatives
of persons who have died from this dis
ease and of others who arc suffering
from it.
"There seems little to support the
view that cancer is the result of con-1
tagiou. Twenty thousand applications
for insurance were reviewed and it
was found that In 488 cases one only
of the parents of the applicant was
stated to have died from cancer and
in four cases both parents were stated
to have died of that disease. There
were 1222 times as many cases in
which one parent had died of cancer
as of those in which both parents had
died of that disease. Them could hardly
be a stronger test than the case of
husband and wife."
As to heredity, Mr. Hunter said"My
first investigation consisted ofj
cases of persons Insured In six com-1
panics, both parents having died of j
cancer prior to date of application for j
insurance. Of 472 grandparents of the i
insured, the cause of death was given |
ill 2:>4 cases of which two were from i
cancer; the cause of death was stat-1
ed in 1S4 of these as 'old age,' the |
average age at death of which was S2. j
In 72 of the grandparents the cause
of death was not known but the age
was given, the average being 62; in
*55 cases neither the age nor the cause
of death was known. It is reasonable
to conclude that if only two died of'
cancer out of 234 parents of personsj
who died of cancer, that disease is not,
hereditary.
"The possibility of heredity in cancer
has generally been studied by ex- j
periraents on anitnals. In the case of j
human beings there has been no previ- j
ous attempt, so far I as am aware to j
investigate the problem lit families where
there has evidently been a can- J
cor strain, if such a thing exists. In
the present investigation, one of the
groups consisted of cases in which
both of the parents had died from cancer;
and in another of the groups, a
parent, and a brother or a sister <>f iho
policyholder had died from that (lis- j
ease. It might be expected, therefore,
that if concer were hereditary, it would I
be shown very clearly in the family
records of these persons but this has j
not appeared.
"Men and women who are in anxiety j
of mind on account of the appearance
of cancer in their ancestry or immediate
family may dismiss such anxieties
as there is no statistical evidence
at the present time that the disease of
cancer is transmitted by Inheritance
in mankind."
