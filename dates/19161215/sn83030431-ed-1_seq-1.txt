ON PROHIBITION
Judiciary Committee Favora
Adoption of National
Amendment.
ACTION IS A SUHPHISE
Question Likely to He Domi
nant Isnnc of Sixt
Congress.
Washington. Dec. H. Nationwide
prohibition look a long stride toward
Congressional consideration to-day when
the House Judiciary Committee voted
unexpectedly to recommend adoption ot
the amendment to submit the constitu
tional (intendment forbidding the manu
facture and sale of liquor for beverage
purpose In the United Statea. Even the
moat enthusiastic champion of the
amendment had not expected favorable
action so soon from the committee,
which at the last session voted to poet
pone Its consideration Indefinitely.
How the resolution will progress
through the turlous legislative sUgeiof
Congress At this session Is problematical,
but Administration leaders doubt that It
nill reach the Senate In time for action
at this session. Prohibition advocates
ate JubllHnt at the action of the com
mittee and predict ultimate adoption of
the resolution and reference of the
merriment to the legislatures of the
various States at a much earlier date
than they heretofore had hoped. A two
third Majority In both houses Is re
quired. .rnalr Mrntlntrnl Divided.
Sentiment In the Senate for and
sgslrst the referendum appears to be
divided rloxely, with a vote on the sub
ject expected within a day or two. '

Congress If the constitutional amend

In the House before the amendment can
be taken up for consideration a special

f the Judiciary Committee, will ask for
such a rule early In January and en
deavor to press the resolution to an

PAVLOWA SUMMONED
FOR SUNDAY DANCING
Sabbath Committee Invokes
Blue Law Against Benefit
Performance.
' Pavlowa, tha dancer, was summoned
to Yorkvllle, court yesterday because she
danced on Sunday. ,
The fact that their services were
gratuitous and that the performance
was for charity did not have sufficient
weight with the New York Rabbath Com
mittee to prevent complaints being made
against the celebrated Ilusslan dancer,
Toto, the Hippodrome clown, and 11. M.
Lavelle. the house manager, charging
violation or the blue law which pro
hlblts theatrical performances on Hun
day.
I 'avion-a and the others did not appear
In court, but they were represented by
Lincoln D. Fronlleh, counsel for Charles
Dillingham, lessee of the Hippodrome.
Detectives said the alleged violations oc
curred at the Hippodrome last Sunday
evening when the benefit for the Home
for llebrew,lnfants was given and that
Mint. I'avlowa'a butterfly wings and
Toto' voluminous coat designated thfm
as ineuiricai.
Mr. Pronllch asked for an adjourn
ment of two weeks to consult District
Attorney Swann, but the Magistrate al
lowed only one week, provided thena
would be no repetition of the perform
ance next Hunday.
No performance was scheduled for
next Sunday night, but the following
Hunday night a large benefit Is planned
for the Have a Home Fund, and clabo
late concerts are scheduled at the Hip
podrome on Sunday evening. December
z, cnriatma Kve. and December 31
New Year's Eve,,
The Hippodrome has no regular-Sunday
evening concerts, but the big play
house ha been filled almost every Sun
day evening recently by a benefit per
formance of some kind for chailty.
These have been given without any
financial profit to the management. Mr.
Dillingham says the ruling will not af
fect the Chrlstmss and New Year's eve
concerts.

'The Government will ask you lo give
It the faculty of solving by decrees all

question which can be regulated only In
war time, the solution of which Involves
the life of Ihe country and Its salvation,
Is .the total suppression of the consump

The Premier's rental ks were greeted
with loud applause from many nf the

"In the army also?"
"Ves, in the entire country," said the
Premier.
The use of the term alcohol In this
connection Is understood to Include such
boveragea aa absinthe, which already
has been suppressed ; whiskeys, brandies
and liqueurs, but not wines or beer.
