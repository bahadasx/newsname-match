WASTING OF ROAD
FUNDS IS UNDER
SCRUTINY NEW
LAW AS REMEDY
Senator McGarry of Walker Has
Announced Purpose of Intro
ducing Measure.
NEED OF COMPREHENSIVE
SYSTEM URGENT, HIS OPINION
Proposition Has Endorsement of
Northern Minnesota Development
Association.
Senator McGdrry of Walker
has announced his purpose to intro
duce a bill in the next legislature to
concentrate more effectively the ad
ministration of road funds.
"Minnesota may raise approxi
mately $30,000,000 for roads per year
by taxation under existing laws,'*
slays Senator McGarry in his an
nouncement.
"There is a great need, in my
opinion, for the establishment of a
comprehensive system to handle the
public road improvement fund in
Minnesota and to prevent the squan
dering of a single dollar.
"Townships are authorized by laws
now to levy up to 13 mills for reg
ular and five mills additional for em
ergency road funds the board of
county commissioners can levy four
milk* for its purposes and lastly is
the provision of a one-mill maximum
levy by the state.
"The one-mill tax for the state
brings about $1,600,000 of revenue
now, so maximum levies under all
the authorization would seem ample
to provide all the funds necessary to
carry on a complete, systematic plan
of road improvement over the state."
Senator McGarry's proposal was
indorsed by delegates to the recent
meeting in Bemidji of the Northern
Minnesota Development association.

DUE TO SAIL TODAY
(By United Press)

nowski, recently appointed Austrian
Ambassador to the United States to
succeed Theodore Dumba, recalled
at the request of the United States
for undiplomatic activity, is due to
sail for New York today from Rot
terdam on the Dutch steamer Nieu
wo Amsterdam.
Immediately after Tarnowski's ap
pointment Great Britain and France
refused to grant him a safe conduct
to the United States. It was gen
erally believed this was a protest of
Great Britain at what she consid
ered the laxity of the United States
in suppressing activity of England's
enemies on United States soil.
The state department immediately
sent notes to Great Britain and
FranCe asking a reconsideration of
the refusal and pointing out that it
wasi the inalienable right of sover
eign nations to exchange ambassa
dors. Great care was taken to make
plain that the United States was
making its recommendations solely
as a matter of diplomatic right and
was not seeking a favor.
Count Tarnowski was one of the
active Central Power diplomats at
Sofia immediately preceding the en
trance of Bulgaria into the war.

FORTY CENTS PER MONTH &-
Is the "Magic City of the North"
to be represented at the St. Paul car
nival of winter sports during the
week of January 27 and let the thou
sands of persons who will be there
know that Bemidji is what its people
have and are claiminghat Be
midji is the liveliest city of its size
in Minnesota? Or shall Bemidji not
be represented and allow rivals to
carry off the honors! as they are care
fully planning to do?
It is squarely up to the business
men and leaders of civic development
of Bemidji to answer this question
and tonight will decide the issue.
There will be a meeting in the
Commercial club rooms this evening
at 8:30 o'clock to which it is urged
every business man and every other
man be present and also have his
wife and family with him. The pro
position is not alone for the members
of the masculine persuasion but for
the women of the city and what is de
sired is to make it a thoroughly
Bemidji -affair.
About 25 energetic citizens met
last night in the Commercial club
rooms and inaugurated the movement
to have Bemidji represented at the
great winter carnival. The matter
was thorougly discussed and it was
decided to Mplace the decision square
ly up to the people of Bemidji lor
their decision.
It is the plan to have at least 150
represent Bemidji in the huge par
ade, each member of the delegation
to be in appropriate costume of a
uniform nature, the garb to be at
tractive and at the same time useful
at other times. Such delegation
might be known as the "Bemidji
Spuds" and it is the intention to let
it be known that they are "there."
Reports from other cities through
out the state are to the effect that
extensive preparations areblready un
der way to provide representation,
Itasca county planning to send fully
300 with a band and other features
and the same is true of other cities
near Bemidji.
This is the first time cities outside
of St. Paul have been invited to par
ticipate in the carnival which has
taken on the aspect of an entire Min
nesota project and it is believed that
the carnival this year will not only
surpass everything in kind in the
past, but be one of the greatest car
nivals ever held in the United States.
From California will come a delega
tion of 6,000 so it can readily be
seen what attention the carnival is
attracting and the magnitude of its
scope.
At the meeting in the Commercial
club rooms last night, presided over
by President Denu, a committee of
three was appointed to arrange for
the meeting tonight, the committee
consisting of W.'L. Brooks, chair
man E. E. McDonald and H. E.
Reynolds.
A committee consisting of Phil
Gill, Fred Shavitch and Charted Com
insky was also named to secure fig
ures on costumes to be worn." A sug
gestion as to costume was red mack
inaw, green knickerbockers, high
stockings and high overshoes, white
toque. The costume for the ladies? is
yet to be selected.
If you're "for" Bemidji, be at the
meeting tonight and be heard. There
Is nothing compulsory about any
thing, only a matter of boosting Be
midji and an effort to progress.
