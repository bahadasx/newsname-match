Cong. Fordney's 'Plurality.
As shown by the report of the state
board of canvassers, Cong. J. W.
Fordney received 28,288 votes in the
district, whilo' his opponent, W. A.
Seegmillcrr had 23,G92, giving Mr.
- Fordney a plurality of 4,590, just 7G
more than his plurality in 1914. ;IIe
. had 8,039. more votes than in 1914,
while Mi Scegmiller received 7,9G3
more, than 'did Mr. Smith in 1914.
Witll an acitve campaign such as he
- lias' always put heretofore, there is
little question but that the vole for
Mr Fordney would have been consid
erably larger. Ilia election was so
pure that he devoted most of his time
this .year to work in outside states
and at that turned down more than
. 80 per' cent of' the calls which 'came
! to him from various parts of the
country. The district will be for Mr.
Fordney just as long as he wishes to
rcrvc it if he continues to serve it as
lie has in the past. ., t ' , ... .,M
WANTS FARM BACK
Mrs. LouiaacCraun Deeded Away
Property Bxpaotinf to B Cared
For With Usual Result
' Louise Braun has begun action to
have a deed to a farm In Perry town
hip given by her to Joseph Qnldet and
wife cancelled, claiming she was to be
cared for during her life, but that she
has been forced to go to work in a
laundry in Owosso to get her living,
having ' been contemptibly treated by
the Guidets, being refused food.
Miss Baughman Resigns.
Miss Leona Baughman, who has been
the popular and successful secretary of
the Owosso Y. W. C. A. for three years,
has resigned on account of ill health,
and will leave Dec. 20 for Florida to
spend the winter with her parents.
. The Owosso association regrets ex
ceedingly to lose Miss Baughman. fler
work has been helpfnl in many lines
especially educational and social. Na
ture study work has been prominent.
The spiritual work has been constantly
cared for and the finding of employment
and homes has been successfully cat
ried out.
Miss Baughman'a successor will come
In January.
Constitutional Amendments.
The official figures on' the four con
stitutional amendments voted upon at
the November election show the ad
option of two of the amendments, pro
hibition and local acts. State-wide
prohibition waa adopted by a major
ity of 68,624, the vote being 353,387
for and 284,754 against; home rule
went down to the extent of 122,599,
there being 256,272 votes for the prop
osition and 378,871 against.; the local
acts amendment carried by a majority
of 8,122 and the fraternal societies
amendment was defeated by 124,590.
The vote on the liquor and the fra
ternal amendments were so decisive
that Michigan voters will probably
never be called upon to vote on them
again. ' ,

WHAT REDvCROSS SEALS DO
Christmas Messenger Helps to Relieve
; and Prevent Disease.
Here arc six ways in which, the
money you spend for Rod Cross
Christmas Seals may be used:
(1) Tuberculosis patients who are
in need of food, clothing, sanatorium
care or other necessities may be re
lieved. (2) A visiting nurse may be en
gaged to go out to the homes of tlie
lxKr and give instruction and advice
on the treatment and prevention of
tuberculosis. She is, a most valuable
educational and preventive agency.
(3) A campaign for a city or coun
ty hospital may be carried on, and
the community he thereby induced to
assume its share of the tuberculosis
burden. Thus your money is multi
plied manyfold.
(4) A dispensary may be maintain
ed where patients-and their families
may call for free advice and examina
tion. (5) Open air schools and fresh nir
classes may be started, where boys
and girls who have tuberculosis or art
threatened withfit may he built up in
body and mind. , ; '
; (6) Educational ,work will be done
to show- the entire community men,
women and children that tuberculosis
can be cured and prevented.

, WASTE OF MONEY
BUILDING ROADS
(The following observations by
Editor Jv N. McCall, of the Gratiot
County Herald, are so pertinent that
we ask our readers interested in good
roads to read and carefully consider
other counties in Michigan will apply
to Shiawassee.)
1 1 here are some suggestions on the
Here are some suggesitnos on the
pertinent or impertinent, depending
on how you look at it. They are such
thoughts. as have come to the writer
in his auto trips of the summer, ex
tending over about 6,000 miles.
The most serious need of the prcs
ent time is a road law which will pre
vent the waste of work on undrained
road beds, the use of worthless ma
terial, faulty construction methods,
and gross negligence in keeping roads
in repair.
As we traveled around the country,
we saw not a few places where a good
grade of gravel was dumped into a
mud hole. No provision whatever was
made for draining off the water which
filled this hole and stood on both sides
of the road after every rain, thus
keeping the road bed soft, so that
every passing vehicle would cut
through, mixing the gravel and mud
until you could not tell what was
gravel and what was mud. Indeed
you do not have to go outside of the
limits of the village of Itnaca to see
instances of this kind of road con
struction. It is an utter waste of
time, money and material.
The first requisite of road construc
tion is a ROAD BED, thoroughly
drained. To put gravel on any other
foundation is reckless waste. In trav
eling through nineteen counties of the
lower peninsula, the writer has been
impressed with the idea that in the
main the material used is of fair qual
ity, but even in the same township
it is far from uniform, nnd in some
instances is so full of sand and clay
as to be worthless. '
' About '.the most useless, and inex
cusable thing is faulty construction
methods. Some townships in Gratiot
county habitually commit these blund
ers. They built a road bed, let it lie
a season or so. It may be pretty fair
when it is built, well drained, smooth,
even, fairly hard, sufficiently crown
ing, etc, but after lying' uncared for
for several months, mud holes form,
it becomes rutted and rough. What
do you thing of a highway commis
sioner, who, without thoroughly re
pairing such a road .bed, putting it in
first class condition and rebuilding
the retaning walls, .proceeds to dump
on gravel f "Dump on" the word,
too, for any officer so incompetent nnd
wasteful as to gTavel SUCH a road i
bed, will literally "dump" the gravel
on, a load in a place. It is never
properly spread, but just loft where
it is dumped, tramped down, driven
over and left in such shape that an
nntu will begin to vibrate the moment
it strikes such a road and vibrate
more and more until a spring or axel
gives way. We have all driven over
such roads. They are really charac
teristic of some townships, not in Gra
tiot county ALONK, wc have them
everywhere, that roads are built. They
are here and everywhere, the work of
careless and incompetent road officers
who leave the unmistakable marks of
their unfitness wherever they. go.
Down on the Williatnston road, to
ward Detroit, we saw some of the fin
est specimens of road grading and
gravel spreading we have over soon
anywhere. It was as smooth and well
graded as a railroad bod, while every
load of gravel was spread with abso
lute evenness. A man was kept on the
road for days going constantly over
every foot of road daily, filling even
the slightest depressions and ensur
ink PERFECT SURFACE DRAIN
AGE. .
This brings us to our last point
ROAD REPAIR. It is hard to write
of this point with any degree of pa
tience. This year we build a fine
gravel road, with sixteen foot road
bod. It is a splendid piece of work
and is" soon known far nnd nonr as a
credit to the township nnd its road
officers.
Then for a WHOLE YEAH, neither
a highway commissioner nor an over
seer goes near it. No one lifts a fing.
or to do a thing.
A little depression appears. Rain
fills it with muddy water. Wagons
with narrow tiros run through it and
cut down deeper into it. 'An auto
swoops through it at n rapid speed
and the watornnd mud nre thrown
out. The' rngoii3 chnrk; into it and
soon it gets deeper. Water stands in
it longer, it breaks through into the
soil below. The soil is mingled with
the gravel. The hole becomes a rut.
It multiplies, and before another sum
mer comes, what was once a beautiful
gravel road, is a rough, rutty, abomi
nation Whose fault, you sayt Whose
can it be but the fault of the careless,
shiftless, incompetent road official and '
the people who re-elected him when
they should have fired himfy There '
should be no politics in road officials.
Just two classes, competcnts and in
competents. If the present laws are not string
ent enough to got results, 'then-more
stringent laws should be adopted. It '
ought to be an absolute crime for an
official or a community to neglect road
repair.
Hundreds of times have wc driven
over roads which with a single drag
ging, scraping or rollng would have
been' in splendid condition, but it was
neglected and within a few weeks the
entire road bod was ruined.
