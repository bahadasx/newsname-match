MayorlsMiiesOrder to Close
Saloons in Bangor
Below is printed a portion of an
article by Walter W. Ridley in a I
recent issue of The Boston Transcript:
Press dispa hes this week, an
nouncing the perplexity -of Bangor as
to the best method of closing its
saloons during the strike of street
railway operatives, must have caused
surprise to the innocent and amuse
ment to the cynical. Maine being a
"dry" state, why should Bangor be
vexed with the problem of closing any
saloons? The mayor and the chief of
police fell into a hot controversy as j
to the wisdom of closing the 123
liquor resorts of that prohibition city.
This difficulty has been happily com
posed. The chief of police has with
drawn his resignation, the mayor
retains his office and 123 saloons have
been definitely closed. And this in
Maine?

easy enough to get liquor in that city
if one knew how. The following
instance shows how difficult it is for
irson upiquamted vith the
jate system to purchase liquor in

A hundred or more foreigners, tm

had liquor which had not been
"chacked." The official went to the
pair. Each had two quarts of liquor.
The bottles bore a well-known brand
nd the United States revenue
stamp. These two men had secured.
withm two hours of landing in the
city, one gallon of whiskey, and it
was not necessary for them to speak
English to get it, either. This shows
the difficulty.

in walking till he finds the right one.
A respectable resident of a district

he is known; an acknowledged drunk
