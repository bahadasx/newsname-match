ued by the Teutonic forces. The latest
Ftatemeiit by the German war office
announces the rapture of R.noo addi
tional prisoner together with 2Cguns.
Seemingly the Rumanians and such
Russian troops as were aiding them
are still on the retreat northeastward,
and military commentator for the
most part do not expect a stand to be
made by the Rumanians before the
line of the Buzeu river I reached.
This line virtually closes the neck
of the province of Moldavia, running
eastward from the Hungarian frontier
to Calata on the lower Danube, near
the Bessarabian border. It Is regarded
as a strong defensive line and one eas
ily susceptible of reinforcement from
Russian sources.

had adopted a friendly attitude to
ward foreigners, were misleading.

property at Parral, where Weeks was
killed. The Alvarado mines, a H.uoo,
