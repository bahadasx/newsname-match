Chancellor Law Asks for Credit of
$2,000,000,000
VOTED BY HOUSE OF COMMONS
-
Head of Exchequer Says Nation Can
Only Hope to Keep up Expendi
ture Long Enough to Win.
London, Dec. 15. Andrew Donar
Law, chancellor of the British ex
chequer, announced In the House of
Commons yesterday afternoon that
the dally average expenditure of
Great Britain in the war had risen to
5,710,000. Bonar Law said the ac
tual expenditure had exceeded the es-.
timate owing to the increase in mu-;
nltlons and additional loans to Great j
Britain's allies and to her dominions.
The chancellor moved a vote of credit
of 400,000,000 ($2,000,000,000),
which the House of Commons unani
mously adopted. I
The chancellor gave the votes of
credit since the outbreak of the war,
and said that they did not quite rep
resent all of the expenditure. There
had been expenditures over and above
the votes of credit of 330,000,000.
bringing the total since the outbreak J
of the war to 9,852,000,000. j
"That figure takes the imagina
tion," he went on. "It is a colossal
figure but I do not think it is an ap-!
palling figure. We cannot continue .
at the present figure indefinitely. All
wo can hope for is that we can keep j
at that figure long enough to beat our '
enemies, and I believe we can go on
long enough, to make sure that it will
not be from financial causes if we fall
to secure victory."
WOMAN HELD FOR BIGAMY
Counsel for Mrs. Mary Warren Thinks
She is Insane
Attorney Harrier B. Chase, assigned
by the Brattleboro Municipal court to
defend Mrs. Mary E. Warren on a
charge of bigamy, Tuesday morning
waived examination and Judge Frank
E. Barber bound the respondent over
to the county court under $1000 ball.
In default of bail she was taken to
Newl'ane Jail this noon.
Attorney Chase said that he would
at once petition a superior court judge
to have Mrs. Warren committed to
the asylum at Waterbury for examina
tion as to her sanity. Her three-year-old
son was taken care of by his father
Itufus Warren of Lowell, Mass., who
came to Brattleboro for the hearing
and had a long conference with his
wife and her attorney.
Mrs. Warren had been known at
Brattleboro since last August as Mrs.
Walter K. Porter, having married
Walter E. Porter of Marlboro here
August 6. When arrested by Sheriff
C. E. Mann she readily admitted that
ahe had .been married twice before
and had not been divorced from her
second husband, Warren, a former
resident of Montpelier and now of I
well. It was to him that she prompt
ly appealed for help when arrested.
The -woman's older daughter by her
first husband, C. E. Wells of Mont
pelier, has been with her mother at
the Marlboro home of Porter, who
has been with the family of Henry
Warren of that town since a small boy
and is generally known as George
Warren.

Washington, Doc. 15. While it is
virtually settled that no safe conduct
will bo issued by tho entente allied
governments to Count Tarnowskl, the
nejwly-appointed Austrian embassa

H-3 Went 'shore on Northern
California Coast
STRUCK BEACH IN DENSE FOG
Crew of 28 In Danger of Suffocation
Before Taken Off by Coast
Guards.
Eureka, Calif., Dec. 15. Twenty
seven members of tho crew of United
States submarine H-3 imprisoned
since dawn yesterday in the submers
ible, which went ashore on a shoal
near tho entrance to Humboldt bay,
California, were rescued last night.
Five of the crew were taken ashore
on a breeches buoy at 5 o'clock. With
in an hour tho remaining 19 men of
the crew and the two officers were
rescued. Coast guardsmen shot a
line across tho bow of the H-3 as
darkness set in and watchers on
shore saw tho submarine become
more steady in the roll of the surf as
the line was made fast. Then a
breeches buoy was rigged and five of
the trapped crew were rescued.
Lieut H. It. Bogusch, commanding
the 113, reported that his vessel was
lying on a sandy bottom, had been
closed up "water-tight and probably
could be refloated with minor dam
age. Some chlorine gas had been liberat
ed during the day, Lieut. Bogusch
faid, from the submarine's batteries,
but his men had not suffered greatly
therefrom.
All the men imprisoned in tho sub
marine suffered bruises in the pound
ing which accompanied their surf
forced progress up to the beach. At
10 o'clock yesterday morning the H-3
was more than 300 yards off shore
when she nosed' into the sand. When
darkness ranici last night she had
traversed 175 yards under pressure of
the mountainous seas.
This progress, which was aided,
Lieut Bogusch said last night, by
emptying the tanks, was the greatest
factor in saving the. lives of her crew,
as her decks were too wave-swept at
the greater depth to permit her crew
to crawl out long enough to .haul
aboard a buoy line shot aboard by
coast guards from the Eureka sta
tion. Pulling out in their cutter, the
coast guardsmen finally made a line
fast and the last man splashed to
safety through the surf at 8 o'clock.
Thousands of people witnessed the
rescue. The coast guard crew and
volunteers were aided by men of the
United States ship Cheyenne, the
mother ship under whose convoy the
II 1, H-2 and H-3 were proceeding
from Puget sound to winter quarters
at San Diego when the accident oc
curred.
PROHIBITION IN FRANCE
Suppression of the Liquor Traffic De
cided Upon by the Government.
Paris, Dec. 14. Total prohibition
throughout Franco of the consump
tion of such alcoholic beverages as
whiskies, brandies and liquors has
been decided upon by the govern
ment. This is shown by the text of
the Journal Official today of Premier
Briand's declaration yesterday before
tho Chamber of Deputies on the sub
ject. The Premier said:
"The government will ask you to
give It tho faculty of solving by de
crees all questions of interest In re
gard to the national defense which
the laws are too slow to regulate. A
particularly grave question which can
be regulated only in war time the so
lution of which involves the life of
the country and its salvation, is the
total suppression of tho consumption
of alcohol."
The Premier's remarks were greet
ed with loud applause. Deputy May
eras Interjected: "In the army al
so?" "Yes, in the entire country," said
the Premier.
The use of the term alcohol in this
connection is understood In France
to include such beverages us absinthe,
which already has been suppressed;
whiskies, brandies and liquors, but
not wines and beer.

STATE GRANGE IN SESSION
Organization Now Has Membership
of 17,000
Rutland. Dec. 12. A representative
gathering of Vermont Grangers as
sembled here today for the three
days' 45th annual convention. Willis
X. Cady of Middlebury, State master
occupied the chair. A brief business
session in tho morning was followed
by tho master's annual address this
afternoon and speeches this evening
by Commissioner of Education Milo
B. II illegas of Montpelier, Judge John
E. Weeks of Middlebury, chairman of
the stato penal board, and W. J. Low
ell of Fredonia, N. Y., master of the
New York State Grange. Mayor Ii.
L. Stafiord welcomed tho convention
ers. The Grange has 17,000 members in
190 subordinate Granges in the state,
according to Secretary A. L. Priest of
Randolph. There are 23 ' Pomona
Granges. In comparison with a year
ago tho present total membership
varifS very little. The Grange has a
permanent fund of $11,584.37 ami a
current fund of $.1,70!U'S, according
to Treasurer F. 11. Pier of Brattleboro.
The expenditures of the last year
for officers' fees, dchates' expenses,
etc., amounted to $3,335.45.
"The man who Invests his time and
capital in an intelligent manner In
the business of agriculture in Ver
mont is going to win," Mr. Cady said
to the grangers in the course of a dis
cussion of education, co-operation,
good roads, Insurance, temperance
and "good of the order." He pointed
out that Vermont is approaching an
era of agricultural prosperity with
farms increasing in value and better
methods of cultivation and fertiliza
tion, greater Intel est In orcharding,
purer bred stock and Improved meth
ods of marketing.
Hd said: "it has often been said
that farmers, because of their scat
tered condition and spirit of indepen
dence, cannot co-operate but I think
that we are proving that this Is not so
The combining of milk shippers to ob
tain better prices Is a notable in
stance of refutation of this notion.
Cow testing associations, in which
Vermont leads, co-operative cream
eries, farmers' clubs, potato growing
associations prove that to bo indepen
dent wo must combine forces." He
urged support of the Grange educa
tional fund, saying that farmers are
learning more and more the need of a
trained mind to acquire success in ag
riculture. Commissioner Ilillegas took us his
topic, "The Education of the Village
and Rural Child." He said he be
lieved that a better understanding of
the school tiansportation law would
remedy the present abuses of It. He
believed that no one is in position to
change this law until It is carefully
studied and watched. The ooni
mlssionir deprecated tho practice of
disfiguring school houses In endeavor
ing to mako repairs that aro in ac
cordance with law and called atten
tion to tho improvement In tho stand
ard of the tetiching force in the State
within a short time.
Of the rural high school problem,
he said. "The condition which makes
it necessary for a boy and girl to
leave home in order to have high
school luivileges is to be deplored."
The home needs the boys and girls
and they need their homes. One
child out of every live In Vermont
cities are found in the high school
and outside of the cities less than one
In ten. There Is need of develop
ment of a high school which can care
for the village boys and girls. A Jun
ior high school, which Is now much
favored by educators, will help to
solve the problem. Mr. Ilillegas
dwelt at length upon tho character of
the work in junior high schools.

Administration Leaders Doubt Pos
sibility oif Resolution Reaching
Senate During Present Session
Washington, Dec. 15. Natlon-wldo
prohibition took a long stride toward
congressional consideration yester
day when the House judiciary com
mittee unexpectedly voted to recom
mend adoption of the amendment to
submit tho constitutional amendment
forbidding the manufacture and sale
of liquor for beverage purposes in the
United States. Even the most en
thusiastic champions of tho amend
ment had not expected favorable ac
tion so soon from the conmilteo,
which at the last session voted to
postpone its consideration indefinite
ly. How the resolution will progress
through the various legislative stages
of Congress at this session is prob
lematical but administration leaders
doubt that it will reach the Senate
1U lime lor action ai una session.

of the resolution and reference of the

e
of
amendment to the Legislatures of tho
various states much sooner than they
heretofore had hoped. A two-thirds
majority in both houses Is required.
Coincident with the committee's ac
tion on the amendment tho prohibi
tion issue was brought directly to the
attention of the Senate when the
Sheppard bill to prohibit tho manu
facture and sale of liquor in the Dis
trict o." Columbia became the unfin
ished business to bo kept before the
Senate' until disposed of. As an
amendment to this bill Senator Un
derwood of Alabama has proposed a
referendum to tho male voters of the
District. Senator Kern of Indiana has
added a proimsal that women also
should participate In the referendum.
Sentiment in the Senate for and
against the referendum appears to be
closely divided, with a vote on the
subject expected within n day or two.
Discussion of tho Sheppard bill afford
ed opportunity for commout on tho
proposed nmend.ment. several sena
tors, among them Shoppard of Texas
Vardaman of Mississippi and Owen of
Oklahoma , predicting triumph for
the cause of nation-wide prohibition
in the near future.
Hardly anyone doubted Inst night
that prohibition will be a dominant
legislative Issue before the new 05th
Congress if the constitutional amend
ment does not reach a vote this win
ter, in the House before the amend
ment can bo taken up for considera
tion a special rule must be adopted
giving it right of way. Representa
tive Webb, chairman of the judiciary
committee, will ask for such a rule
early in January and endeavor to
press the resolution to an early vote.
'President Wilson was urged lata
yesterday by Rev. Clarence T. Wilson
representing the Methodist confer
ence board, to use his inlluence with
Congress to prohibit the use of the
mails for the sending of liquor adver
tise merits by unlicensed liquor deal
ers. An effort Is being made to have
such a provision included in the cur

HELP FOR SUFFERING
Mrs. Hope Graves Hazeltlne Asks
Aid for Children.
Editor of the Bemnington Banner:
Early In January I am returning to
England, where I shall at once re
sumo my work at the clothing Depr't
for Beilgian Refugees at Cambridge.
As your readers will know there
are many thousands of these utterly
destitute pet sons in England, in
Cambridge and the surrounding vil
lages we have several hundred.
Those who are unable to support
themselves and alas! there are
many of these, old men and women
and widows, whose husbands have
been killed, with little children are
housed and fed and clothed. At the
beginning of the war appeals for help
received generous support, but as
time has passed supplies have run
short owing to the multiplicity of
funds which have had to be main
tained. I appeal to the readers of your
paper to send me donations to take
back to this most necessary work.
They will be sincerely appreciated,
and will be acknowledged by tho
treasurer of the fund for Belgian Re
lief work in Cambridge. Jf all those
persons who are having a happy
Christmas in their own homes will
think for but a few moments of these
poor people with no homes they will,
I feel sure, do something for them.
Truly yours,
Hope Graves Hazeltine.
VERMONT POETS
Distinctive Publications Issued by
Three Well Known Writers.
For Vermont the year 1016 will have
one distinctive nature, the publica
tion of a book of poems by three Yer
niouters. First came "The Harp of
the North" by Arthur Wentworth
Hewitt and almost simultaneously at
the opening of the Christmas season
"Thti Land We Love" by Wendell P.
Stafford and "Stray Thoughts in
Verso" by Rev. W. E. Baker.
Each poet's work is distinctive and
each one adds to the strength of lit
erature and beauty of thought. Rev.
Hewitt has touched more closely the
level of common life, the joys, griefs,
thoughts and aspirations of the man
and woman who toil and strive to
live.
Judge Stafford's book is a collection
of poems written during a term of
years, many of the poems having been
published in the reports of events for
which they were written. Some, like
"The Old Pine" and "Tb.iddeus Fair
banliS" are local in character. In
many others zeal and lofty patriotism
thrill and Inspire the reader while the
lyrics in the volume breathe a pure
and tender love that charms and en
riches the emotions of all mankind.
Rev. linker Is not a native of Ver
mont, but is one of the able Congre
gational preachers of the state located
at Morrisville. His poems do not pos
sess the nationalism or state pride
found In Judge Stafford's poems but
they do picture a mother's love, a
father's loyalty, pure love, tho poetry
of nature, the grandeur of the uni
verse, the charms of companionship
and graceful exhortations for the bet
ter things cf life. They are printed in
attractive booklet form and cannot
fail to bring the reader a keener
pleasure and a purer devotion.
Every Vermonter who loves his
state. Its men and women, the charms
of nature and purse and lofty thoughts
should add to his library the threo
volumes of Vermont poetry published
during tho year 1910. St. Johnsbury

WOMAN CAN'T BE FRIEND
Startling Assertion Made by a New
York Philosopher.
New York, Dec. 13. An important
discovery, which is likely to affect
the attitude of men toward women
and women toward women, was made
yesterday by Charles Gray Shaw, pro
fessor of philosophy at New York
University, who has devoted consider
able time and effort In research work
on the problem of "Can a woman be
a friend, and if not, why not?"
"She cannot be a friend," Profes
sor Shaw announces, "for, although
the word Is given In both genders, the
fact alone is masculine. The reason
for tills state of unfriendliness in wo
man is that to be a friend a clear cut
personality and a disinterested out
look on life are required. Woman
lacks both of these. Woman is never
a friend because she Is never an in
dividual, and to be an individual, one
must stand alone. Woman is a planet
a satellite well adapted to revolv
ing around some center, but not or- .
ganized so as to stand alone. j
"Men's clubs, of which they are so
proud, are combinations made for kill
ing time and fostering laziness. On
the other hand, the woman's club is
an attempt. to generate feminine
friendship. It is a hothouse for ten
der plants.
Tho Orchid.
The orchid i a peculiar plant, for,
strange as it may seem, there is no
distinctively orchid odor. One smells
like the violet, others like the rose, the
hyacinth, the daffodil. Orchids nre the
monkeys, the mimics of the vegetable
world, in edor as well as form and
tint. No other flower resembles an or
chid, but orchids ure forever aping
butterflies, pansles, roots, spiders, pitch
plants, birds und what not. And they
aro not absolutely certain to look just
the same twice In succession.

Christmas Club Checks Distributed
to Patrons I his Morning
BEATS LAST YEAR S FIGURES
Plan Will Be Continued and 3
Cent Interest Will Be Paid
Next Year.
Per
Twelve hundred checks aggregating
over $40,000, the annual distribution
of the Bennington County National
bank's Christmas club, were delivered
by the local mail carriers this morn
ing. A goodly portion of this amount
will be in circulation during the next
few days and Bennington merchants
will soon begin to realize what tho
Christmas clut plan means to tne
prosperity of the community at this
season of the year.
The Christmas club plan, that of
saving toward a particular end, is a
comparatively recent one. Several
years ago, it is generally understood
the manager of a payroll department
in a factory In New Jersey instituted
a week by week saving plan out of
the earning of the employees at their
reciuest. Appreciating the increase
in thrift through this experience and
realizing how tills splendid plan
could be enlarged by a general adop
tion, he started the system through
cue the banks of the country. As a
result of this little experiment in a
factory, there are several thousand
banks across the country, today that
are operating the clubs for the wel
lare of their communities.
The Bennington county National
Bank was the first bank in Benning
ton to introduce this progressive plan
into this community. In 1913, the
first club paid out 7,2ut) to a few
hundred depositors. At the close of
tho third year it now pays out J40,o00
to 13"t) persona 1.. Bi nningtou" and
vicinity. , ..-
The advantages of the Christmas
Club have been 60 strongly impressed
upon the otlicials of the Bennington
County National bank that they have
this year decided to pay interest at
the rate of three per cent on all
Christmas club deposits.
The experience of tho Bennington
County National bank during the
three years that the clubs have been
conducted is that the plan has not
only collected a considerable sum of
money to be expended during the
weeks before the annual holiday sea
son but that the disiosition to save
money has been given an Impetus
that could have been created in no
other manner. Families that never
beiore pretended to save money, that
could not be persuaded that it was
possible for them to put by something
from their weekly wages, have taken
out cards in the club and carried
them through the year. In numerous
cases the Christmas club has laid the
foundation for a banking account or
has been the basis of a savings ac
count to which will be added tho
chocks that were distributed this
.morning.
Although this bank already had 7
different classes last year, it has ad
ded two more classes to its next
year's schedule In order that the
poople of the community may take
advantage of every form of the club,
it has the increasing and decreasing
classes in addition to the steady pay
ments. The smaller class starts at
2 cents each week and increases 2
cents each week, the last payment
being $1. Those who wish may stort
at $1 and have the smaller payments
come at the end of the year. Cards
are supplied for this purpose. It
also has a class starting at 5 cents
and increasing each week by 5 cents.
In like manner, the payments may be
reversed, starting at $2.50 and de
creasing 5 cents to the minimum.
These classes have both been very
popular and have mot the needs of
Hennlngton people who might have
found it difficult to make steady pay
ments when employment has been
irregular. In addition their will bo 5
steady payment classes ranging 25,
50. $1, $2 and $5 per week. .
The 1917 Christmas Savings club
will be made up of the following nine
classes:
Class 2 Starting at 2 cents the
first payment and increasing each
week by 2 cents, tho total paid In be
ing $25.50 for fifty weeks.
Class 2 A Starting at $1.00 the
first payment and decreasing each
week by 2 cents, tho total paid in be
ing $03.73 for fifty weeks.
Class 5 Starting at 5 cents the
first payment and increasing each
week by 5 cents, the total paid in be
ing ..(13.75 for fifty weeks.
Class 5 A Starting at. $2.50 the
first payment and decreasing each
week by 5 cents, the total paid in be
ing $3.75 for fifty weeks.
Class 25 Tho first and each succes
sive payment being 25 cents, tho total
for fifty weeks amounting to $12.50.

cessive payment being 50 cents, tho
JURYSATUPENTIRE
NIGHT AND THEN
Failed to Reach Decision in Case of
Wal&ridge vs. Fillmore & Made ,
JURORS EXCUSED Till MONDAY
, Judge Miles Informs Attorneys that
Unless Cases are Then Ready
Jurors Will Be Discharged,
Following the announcement late
this afternoon that the jury in the
land damage case of J. Ed Walbridge
vs Fillmore & Slade that It had been
impossible to reach a verdict, Judge
Willard W. Miles of Barton, who la
presiding at the present terra of Ben
nington county court, endeavored to
start the trial of some one of the
cases on the jury calendar. He was
unable to do so, however, and the
jurors were excused until Monday.
Judge Miles wishes to state
through the Banner that unless tho
jury cases are ready for trial when
court convenes next week that the
jurors will be discharged for the
term.
The case of J. Ed Walbridge vs.
II. D. Fillmore and Burnside G. Slade,
which was put on trial Monday after
noon, went to the jury at 5 o'clock
Thursday afternoon. Judge Miles in
formed the jurors that if they reached
a decision not later than 9 o'clock in
the evening he would open court to
receive their decision. They did not
report at 9 o'clock in the evening and
when court convened this morning
they were still behind locked doors
debating the merits and demerits of
the case. At 11.15 o'clock they came
into court and announced that they
were unablo to agree. They were
then discharged.
The prospect today is that when
court convenes Monday 'the case of
Jessie Kussell vs. John Harte will be
taken up. Miss Russell, a vaudeville
actress, brings action against' Mr.
Harte, the proprietor of a local mov
ing picture theatre to recover dam
ages of $6000 for injuries alleged to
have been sustained in a fall in the
theatre building. Holdcn & Healy ap
pear for the actress and Daniel A.
Guiltinan for the theatre proprietor.
Sheriff Godfrey will probably go
to Salem tomorrow for Francis Ketch-
am, who Is confined at present in the
Washington county jail in that vil
lage and who Is under Indictment for
the murder of William Costello in this
village on the night of September 16.
PROF. WETHERELL DIES
Head of Middlebury's History Depart
ment III Only Two Weeks
Archibald D. Wetherell, head of the
history department at Middlebury Col
lege, died Tuesday afternoon at the
Mary Fletcher hospital in Burlington
after a short illness. Prof. Wether
ell's sudden death is a shock to the
college. He was very popular, not
only among students but in the town
as well. He was 40 years of age.
His death was caused by an infect
ed clot which formed in a large blood
vessel at the base of the brain. He
became 111 two weeks ago with an
acute cold in the head and he was fin
ally taken to the hospital to be treat
ed by 'specialists.
Professor Wetherell was born in
Russell, N. Y., In 1876, the son of Dar
ius and Sarah Barbara Wetherell, who
survive him. He was educated at
Potsdam, (N. Y.) Normal, was gradu
ated from Middlebury college with
