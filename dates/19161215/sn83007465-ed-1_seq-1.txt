London, Dec. 13.?A strong current
of public sentiment opposed to
the German pe;v?e proposal was evi-1
dent in the first expression available
last night, both from public men and '
the British press, although these'
were without knowledge of any de-j
finite terms and without any work
from high authorities' sources indicating
the attitude of the government.
The only Information was in the j
jk?cdd icruris wnicn came irom uerlin'
and in the absence of some tangible i
official proposition, British officials
were disposed to maintain reserve. It
was noticeable that the proposal had
not created any profound impression
upon, the average Londoner. There
was little talk in the hotels or other
public places and this discussion was
far less animated than in the recent
*
ministerial crisis.
Government circles also held aloof
from any discusson, with an evident
desire to learn more of the details
before committing the new administration
to a definite course of action.
The foreign office would make no
comment in the absence of the terms,
but indicated that the British attitude
up to the present was embodied
in the declarations made from time
to time by the former premier and
Viscount Qrey and that any new pro
posals would have to be decided b>
all the Entente allies before a dot)
ignite attitude^ was possible.
Thone in close association with the
new government took the view that
the proposals would prove entirely
unacceptable, mainly because they
were not likely to touch what the
ruling authorities regard as the most
essential basis of Any peace, namely,
such guarantees against German militarism
as will permit England,
France an their allies to demobilize*
their vast armies, reduce their onor- [
mous military expenses and retain to

Fletcher's Influence Too Strong
on Rank and Muscle Shoals
Too Good on Power.
Washington, Dec. 12.?Three important
matters in which the people
of South Carolina are deeply interested?the
location of the sites for
the $20,000,000 nitrate plant authorised
under the Smith law, the $11.000.000
Tillman armor plate factory,
and the farm loan* hank?are. according
to the heat Information available
here today, to he decided within
the next SO days.
Focusing every known influence
which it can secure on landing the ni-1
trate plant, the people of Alabama
who have been fighting for-almost a
year to secure this establishment at
Muscle Shoals, it is said, have sent
cne of the most powerful lobbies'
ever known to the Southern Commer- l
rial congress, now in session at Norfolk.
in the hope of creating sentl-t
ment towards Muscle SHioals and to1
have the eongrens go on record
through resolutions which are to he

the nitrate plant hill, wan destined

I'shment for South Carolina result

Both Premier Lloyd-George and 11
Mr. Balfour, secretary for foreign af- 1
fairs, are slightly ill and this may 1
result in deferring the announcement 1
of the plans of the new government '
next Thursday, but if an announce- <
ment is made it will possibly include
reference to the German proposal. '
though this is unlikely, pending re- j<
ceipi or the proposal itself thro'ugh '
official channels. 11
Some early expicssions, indicating '
the general drift of sentiment, Vere 1
as follows: '
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: "We '
want to know more about the terms. 1
for without them the Imperial chan- ^
celor's suggestion of peace is prepos
terous and ridiculous. We, too, are ^
conscious of victory and his boastings
will be laughed at."
The Marquis of Londonderry. |
"We have got to win the war. Peace
at the present time would be disas- |(
trous to the nation and the empire. (
It is only a question of time and wV <
vill win out absolutely."
Principal Burrows, of Kings Col- 1
lege: "No peace iP possible on the <
basis that Germany is victorious." J|
Sir Gilbert Parker, after mingling <
with his associates in the House ot j \
Commons, said: "This is clearly a 1
political manoeuver, desfgned to ira- (
press the world as a dramatic stroke. 1
but having little serious purpose tod
ward securing an enduring peace^
One of the chief essentials of any 1
peace would be such a curbing of ,
German militarism that a resumption ,
of the present conflict would be ini \
possible. Without such a guarantee 1
England and France would be com- |
pelled as a matter of self-defense -to |
retain vast armies and thus continue,
the enormous war burdens of thci.

to resume peace with the assurance j
that they will not again be plunged (

said, to lose no more time over the "
bank question but to busy them l

seeing that they had lost on the |
bank matter.
While no definite decision has beenl]
or will be rendered by the farm loan]
hoard for several days as to whert? i
these bunks are to be located, then-1
is apparently no room to doubt now j
that Jacksonville has won out In itsj

It has been recognized from th?,
start that it would hardly be possihh
for the farm lo^n board to pet,
Florida inasmuch as Senator I). IV,
Fletcher of that State is one of the
influential and powerful members of
the senate and has been at work on
this matter for not less than five or
six yen^s. He was chalrmnn of th"
United States commission *>n rural

upon which to base the rural credit law,
from which was evolved thej
farm loan bank Idea. In addition to!
this It is hardly probable that anyj

study to this matter as Senator|
Fletcher. When ho hegnn the move- j
ment for the establishment of th<farm

days later when the farm loan hoard

Washington. Dec. 12.?Germany's
proposal for peace is regarded here
is having broken the chains which
for months have restrained the
United States as well as other neutrals
from making offers of mediation.
Now that one set of belligerents
las siginfled its willingness to disiuss
peace terms?a condition often
reiterated as necessary to any action
t>y President Wilson?there are indirations
that when the United States,
icting as intermediary, transmits the
3erman proposal it may accompany
Its action by some steps, necessarily
ielicate, to throw the influence of the
United States into the balance for at
least a consideration, however preliminary,
of the terms on which a
lasting peace might be brought to th
world. Some ranking ofllcials of the
American government believe a
league of nations, such as President
Wilson has suggested, must be the
outcome, %nd it could not be perfected
without the participation of the
United StateB.
Whether the United States will
transmit the German proposal without
any comment whatever or accom*
|iany it with some formal or informal
expression will not be finally decided
until the note delivered to American
Tharge Grew in Berlin reaches Prcsi.|
dent Wilson's hands, probably tomor-j
row.
There were indications tonight that
President Wilson might lind some
way to express the solemn and earnest
wish of the United States for a
"areful consideration of the suggestion
of peace, even before the Kntrnte
governments have made known
Iheir attitude toward the German
proposal. This, however, it was
puiiiieu our, necessarily would be
lone in such a delicate and ultraconIdential
way that it never would be
publicly known should the Allies dedine
the offer. This course was saio
c be absolutely necessary so as to
eave the United States free and un
nnbarrassed to act when an accepable
peace offer comes.
Regardless of whether President 1
CVilson decides to accompany the Gernan
proposal with any word, it was
said tonight he unquestionably
*ould take steps to learn the attitude
if the Entente Allies toward the
peace move and possibly might again
send to Europe his personal friend
pnd advisor. Col. E. M. House.
None of the official dispatches had
arrived tonight. The government's
first information was conveyed in the
Associated Press dispatches from
P.erlin. President Wilson was said
to be deeply interested, but reserving
pomment. Secretary Lansing maintained
a similar attitude. The cabinet
discussed the development at its
tegular Tuesday meeting, but the situation
was described by members a?
*o obviously delicate that no announcement
could be made.
The absence of any specific terms
Tor peace in the note, or In the German
chancellor's speech, was in ;.
measure a disappointment to those
who expected some concrete expression
of a basis on which negotiation's
might begin. The German embassy,
however, is in possession of -advices
which outline in a general way whi<
[Jermany expects and the diplomat"
of the Entente Powers, through *the
means of being supplied with infoi
mution. believe thev have n ?retio.-'.i
idea of what terms the Central Cow
era are willing to advise the basis for
discussion.
The whole German view of the
peace move is that it is a step towards
a discussion of peace terms
which if it amounts to anything. <
ought to show definite progress early '
In January.
There is said to be no possibility
nf a peace conference being held in j
the United States. Berne and The<
Hague are mentioned as most likely ;
?nd it is not doubted that Count Von ]
Bernstorff. the German ambassador \
here, would go as one of his country's |<
representatives. His attitude war ^ 1
expressed tonight In the following i
ttatement:' jl
"I am. of course, extremely gratl- <
led at the step that has been taken, i
I hope that it will be successful. 1
Even if It does not lead to peace It
iffers proof that Germany wants i

paign, and does not desire the responsibility
for further suffering of
mankind, loss of life and property.
Germany wants peace and does noi
desire conquest, I cannot say any
thing about the terms."
Germany, it is said here, was moved
to bring out the peace proposal
at this time principally because she
had given up hope that President
Wilson would make a move. Another
controlling factor was the re
cent crisis in the Itritfsh government
and the reorganization of th^
government there and. in France.
The coming of winter and the consequent
lull in fighting which would
give opportunity for peace overtures
before the belligerents prepare for
another spring campaign was still
another factor.
Would Force Showdown.
One of the principal objects, however.
was to force a "showdown" and
draw from the Entente ullies some
indication of whether they are dis
posed to make peace now or whether
they are determined to crush (Jer
many and dismember her.
Diplomats of the Entente allies
1 ere regard the peace offer as having
the double purpose of placing upon
the Allies the responsibility for continuing
the war. and for impressing
upon the German people that they
are. fighting a defensive conflict
against enemies who refuse quarter.
Coming immediately after the culmination
of the triumphant Rumanian
campaign, the peace offer. En
tente diplomats say. is intended also
to impress the German people that
they need have no lack of confidence
in their government to continue the
war.
The actual procedure in conveying
Germany's proposal to her enemies,
according to precedent, begins with
Charge Grew forwarding the note to
Washington. The State department
then will forward it to the American
ambassador resident in the country
to be addressed and he In turn presents
it to that government, acting
in the interest of Germany and bet
allies.
One immediate effect of the peace
developments upon the United States
will he to hold in abeyance practically
all the diplomatic issues pending
with the warring countries. The new
submarine issue with Germany, the
protest against deportation of Belgians.
the controversy with Great
Britain nvcr mail? ami nAtnniopno .. 11
will mark time until it becomes apparent
whether they will be solved
by the advent of peace.
Regardless of how far Germany's
proposals may be expected to go toward
ending the war. it was regarded
as of the greatest significance that
for the first time in two and a half
years of war one group of belligetenrs
had addressed the other on the
subject through the channels of
diplomacy.
In German quarters here it Is be
lieved that any sort of an armistice
during a discussion of peace plans
would be out of the question, because
tMs is an economic as well as militr
v war.
Meantime the Centra. Powers, it iaid.
expect all neutrals to encourage
peace talk.
So far as has been disclosed 110
intimation reached 1he American
government forecasting the action
of the Central Powers. Today a dispatch
sent from Rerlin Sunday night
to the German embassy announced
the intention of the government to
nake public peace proposals "prohblv
Tuesday." TMs was taken f.?
indicate that the move had been de
elded upon Saturday or Sunday and
probably after Emperor William'*
five hour conference with Gen. Von
II in don burg.
As the texts of the chancellor's
speech, the note to the bellgeronts
md the note to the Holy See were
published, it became apparent that
lhe Germanic allies had not propos
?d specific peace terms, but rather
f ad initiated a movement for pe:ic?..
ind it became apparent that the matler
resolved itself in effect into an
ifficial communication of whit Gen
tnan statesmen have said many time*
before in public and in the press,
that they ?were willing to discuss

Washington, Deo. 1^.?Based upon
information from their home governments,
the Kntente diplomats believe
Germany's terms are in general
about as follows:
| Restoration of Belgium, with the
conditions which would practically
leave it under German control and
probably give over the port of Antwerp
to Germany.
Restoration of the occupied portions
of Northern France, but with

to Germany supplies of iron
and other raw materials drawn from
there.
Domination of Mesopotamia by
Germany and Austria to give them a
path to the Persian Gulf and break
England's gateway into India and
Egypt.
To award to Bulgaria all of Serbia
as far south as Nish. which would
take from Serbia as much territory
a? she gained in the Balkan wars.
They expect Germany will demand
the return of her African colonies or
at least propose to exchange them
for the French colonics
Turkey's interests . r< considered a
minor affair and not fully developed {
in consideration of peace.
The attitude of the Balkan nations'
of the Germanic allies, it was ex
plained, will be set forth in the'
notes which have been dispatched
;from Sofia and Constantinople and
nothing of them is known at the Bal-j
kan legations here, except that Bulgaria
probably will expect to get
Macedonia and Dobrudja, which formerly
belonged to her, making the
Danube the boundary between Bulgaria
and Rumania and shutting the
latter from the Black sea.
Recent dispatches to th?> German
embassy indicate a belief that the
general terms might be in substance

they anticipated the action of the bol!

As a result of three meetings of the

and vicinity, a permanent organization
has been effected, a constitution

officers elected: Dr. W.

The most emphasized fact at the

to have complete co-operation
between the farmers and al1 business

As this is a time when every one is
thinking of ways and means to economize,
the following resolution was
unanimously passed at the last meetIre:

A restoration of the status quo
existing before the war. This lncludes
the evacuation of Belgium
and the restoration of the occupied
portions of Northern France with the
exception pf Alsace and Lorraine. Noauthorized
expression was obtainable
from the embassy as to whether conditions
would be attached to the
restoration of Belgium and FrenCfc
territory but it was understood that
German idea was to make provision
for the future neutrality of Belgium
and probably propose defortification,
particularly of the city of Antwerp.
It was also understood that no conditions
amounting to economic con
trol of the mineral lands of Northern
France would be likely to be
asked. All Germany's lost eolonier
she experts to he returned. Her possessions
in the Pacific, however, are
not a subject of great concern add
the Berlin government is understood
to be ready to relinquish the claim
on Kiau Chau.
The security of Turkey in possession
of Constantinople probably
would be insisted upon by the Cen11al
Powers, as well as the restoration
of Albania. J
The establishment of independent
kingdoms in Lithuania and Poland
would be one of the factors in the
German proposal, that part of Poland
possess'd by Germany at the
outbreak of the war would not be included.

(tl<l Claim Against U. S.
Government.
Washington. Dec. 12.?An interesting
story of ante-bellum days was
neveloped here today as the result 01
%
a visit to Washington a few days ago
of former Governor John Gary Evans;
of Spartanburg.
Before the Southern Mates seceded.
Mr. Evans' father was a captain
ir the I'nited States army, according
to the way Representative Byrnes related
the story today. When tb?
South withdrew from the Union,
South Carolina among them. Cor.
Erans' father was loyal to his section
and resigned his commission as'captain
in the Federal artjiy.
Two or three years ago?almost
years after the war had ended?rcongress
passed a law proviong pay for
officers who were in the regular
United States army When the war began
and who resigned. Clain\ was
made in the interest of ( apt. Evans
of Edgefield, but his representatives
wore informed by the government officials
that his claim was barred because
when he turned over the property
under hi- control to the United
States authorities upon resigning hf?t
commission, all the equipment In hisr.
care was not there, this lack of
equipment amounting to about $1,?
100. For this reason the claim was;
not paid.
Last Sunday Mr. Evans was looking
over some of his father's old papers
and came across a receipt from
the proper authorities showing that
('apt. Evans had many years agc*>
paid the amount charged against him
in full and that this discharged the
claim standing against him. Col.
Evans immediately came to Washington
and showed the receipt to
government ottieials and several
members of the South Carolina delegation
in congress, Mr. Bvrnea
Among them. As a result of finding
this receipt the legal representatives
[>f Capt. Evans will probably be paid
by the government in accordance
with the recent law, the exact
unount of this payment not ascertained
here yet.
