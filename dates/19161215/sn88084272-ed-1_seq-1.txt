questions involving the legality of un-

vere argued today before the supreme

In two West Virginia caseh the court
reviewed decrees of federal judge Da -ton
finding the United Mine Workers

and also combinations in restraint of

Dayton issued broad injunctions.

Wellsburg, W. Va, against the Glass
workers' organization.
Judge Dayton's decrees and injunc

WILSON DELAYS
PEfiGEPROPDSAL
Awaits Statement From
Lloyd George Before Mak
ing Recommendation.
Washington, T. C. Deo. 15. Presi
dent Wilson probably will not finally
determine on any formal steps in con
nection with the peace proposals of the
central powers until after David Lloyd
George, the British prime minister, has
spoken in the house of commons Tues
day, indicating the attitude of the en
tente toward peace.
In the meantime through the Ameri
can diplomatic representatives in the
capitals of the entente powers, the
American government will keep in close
touch with the situation.
It is known to be the view of most
of the cabinet members that the Ameri
can government should move cautiously
and do nothing to imperil its influence
for peace.
Want League of Xatliinn.
President Wilson is known to attach
great importance to the possibility of
establishing an association of nations to
maintain peace. He outlined indefinite
terms or procedure ne wouia lane in
initiating a peace movement in the
course of a speech delivered here lat
May before the League to Enforce
Peace At that time the president said:
"If it ever should be our privilege to
suggest or initiate the movement for
peace among the nations now at war, I
am sure that the people of the United
States would wish their government to
move these lines:
We Ilae othing to Ak.
"First, such a settlement with regard
to their own immediate interests as the
l-elllgerents may agree upon. We have
nothing material of any kind to ask for
ourselves and are quite aware that we
are in no sense or degree parties to the
present quarrel. Our interest is only
in peace and its future guarantees.
"Second, a universal association of
the nations to maintain the Inviolate se
curity of the highways of the seas for
the common ami unhindered use of all
nations of the world and to prevent any
war .bagun either - contrary to ireatjr
covenants or "without warning ahd
Without 'warning and without full sub
.mission of the causes to the opinion of
the world, a virtual guarantee of terri
'tcrial Integrity and political Independ
ence." May Transmit Notes at Once.
Secretary of stale Lansing early to
day held his first personal conference
with president Wilson since the peace
proposals of the central powers were
made public It was said the formal
notes from Germany and Austria might
go forward before nignt and necessarily
in view of the probability that the
president would take no' independent
action until after Lloyd George has
spoken in the house of commons, they
probablv would be accompanied only
by formal notes of transmittal.

SAYS U. S. HAS A RIGHT
TO INITIATE PEACE PROPOSAL
St. Louis. Mo, Dec. i. Senator
Stone, chairman 6f the senate foreign
re'. tions committee, asserted Thurs
day night before the League to Enforce
Peace that a neutral nation which has
suffered from the effects of the Euro
pean war, particularly the United
States, has a right to initiate a move
ment for peace.
"Since the war has almost from the
beginning resulted in offensive attacks
on the rights and dignity of our sov
ereignty and Inflicting incalcuable In
jury to our national interests, all of
which we have bocne with patience,
because of our friendship for the na
tions involved," said senator Stone, "it
se ms to me that after enduring these
attacks and suffering these losses for
nearly two and a half years, with no
end yet in sight, that we have a right
without regard to any question of
sympathy or humanity but solely on
our own account and to safeguard our
own interests, to approach the combat
