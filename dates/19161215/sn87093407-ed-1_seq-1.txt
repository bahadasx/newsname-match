COUNTYDRAINS
PRIVATE LAKE
Is l.afe Hamilton still playing politics?
Fifty indignant farmers of the Suis creek precinct,
three miles east of Kent, think so.
Resolutions were adopted at a meeting in the Tan
ner school recently, condemning the King county com
missioners for authorizing the draining of Ham lake,
located on the farm of John T. Mason, at an estimated
cost of $1,000, which, in reality, they assert, is nothing
more than a settlement of one of Lafe Hamilton's po
litical debts.
The work In being done by eight
men drawing county wage* under
the supervision of the county road

pervlaor James Jones, who. In turn,

Oliver O Otto, who acted as
chairman of the Indignation meet
ing. described the drainage plan, as
suKg> sted by those favoring it, as
follows:
About 200 yards of HO-lnch gal
vaulted pipe line will be placed in
a channel having a deep enough
drop to lower Ham lake two and
a half feet. The lowering of this
lake is supposed to carry off water
from a low bit of road, nearly a
quarter of a mile from the lake, by
the seepage route.
"In reality." explained Otto, "the
lowering of the lake will simply
give Mataon considerable more

full of pep.
"You're to see Santa Claus," .Mrs.
Hasmussen explained to her
prancing son. "Now tell him what
you want."
Young Deane wasn't shy. He
walked up to Ih«> outstretched arms
of the department store Santa
Claus.
Santa Claus leaned over.
"What do you want me to bring

grab. In which he clutched the false

Deane tried to run out with the
whiskers, but he was stopped and

C. R. Cotterill, another of the
farmers opposing the propoeition,
described it as simply being a "big

"The lake already liaa a natural
