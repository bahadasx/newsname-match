WILSON AWAITS RIGHT
MOMENT TO COUNSEL PEACE
President Withholds Decision as to
Part United States Will Play in
, Futheiin Central Powers'
Proposals.
Washington, Dec. Serious con
sideration is being given by President
Wilson to the possibility that any ex
changes of views that may follow the
peace proposals of the central powers
to the entente allies may develop an
Opportunity to bring forward the sug
gestion for a league of nations to en
force . permanent peace. He has
reached no decision as to the course
to be followed by the United States, '
and probably will not pending the ar
rival of the official cablegram con
, taming the communication handed
Charge Grew by the German govern
ment. .
, The cablegram had not been re
ceived at the state department tonight
and in the meantime all officials were
most reticent about discussing the
situation. It is understood that the
communication will be transmitted
promptly to the entente governments
regardless of what ''attitude may be
adopted by the United States, and for j
this reason there is a general belief
that' any steps taken by the United
U t.r.Ml '.rtron
i ,ii.
from one set of belligerents to the"
other.
It is j 1T"o'1 that the American
course probably must be guided large
ly by the reception given the Teutonic
offer to the entente countries, al
though it is regarded as certain that
either informally or formally, quietly
or publicly, the government here will
find a way of displaying its interest
in the restoration of peace. Most of
ficials think that a consideable time
will elapse after the communication is
delivered before a reply is framed by
the allies and that, in the meantime,
a very clear idea of what that reply
is to be and how any attempt at medi
ation by neutrals would be viewed,
will be -gained 'through diplomatic
channels. :
