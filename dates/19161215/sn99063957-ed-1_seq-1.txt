Feeling Now Is That the Allies Should Consider the Offer,
and Make a Statement of Terms That Would Be Satis
factory to Them Germany's Willingness To Consider
Disarmament and World Peace Causes Change
By Robert J. Bender,
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Washington, Dec. 15. For nearly two hours today
President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing con
sidered the question of supplementing the forwarding of
the German peace proposals to allied capitals with some
suggestions from this government.
At the conclusion of the conference neither the presi
dent nor Secretary Lansing would throw any light upon
what, if any, decision was reached.
"I have nothing to say now. There is no announcement
to be made at present. There is no conclusion to discus
sion," summed up Lansing's reply to inquiries from news
papermen. It was indicated after the conference that, the state
department at least has little on which to work in the
way of expressions of public sentiment in this country,
except as voiced in the newspapers.
In the past the department has been flooded with tele
grams, giving individual views of what ought to be done,
but in this instance none has come.
Cabinet Takes It Up.
Washington, Dec. 15. The whole sub
ject of peace and the part America can
jplay, it' any, will undoubtedly be thresh
ed out in this afternoon 'a cabinet ses
sion. Confidential Information from Secre
tary Crew of the American Berlin em
bassy dispatched with Germany 's pro
posals, is scheduled for presentation to
the members along with consideration
-' past official reports and recent un
official versions of foreign attitude to
vard peace.
The state department was reliably un
derstood to be collecting this forenoon
a'l its past information bearing on the
subject of peace. This, taken with news
messages, indicated a sentiment ou the
rtilies' part against yielding up the
struggle to diplomacy at this. moment.
Would Discuss Points.
Meantime, German official hints here
pointed to a willingness to talk at least
B partial disarmament and likewise a
v.illingness for introduction of a world
guaranty of peace.
The administration now feels that
t! ere may be instructive discussion of
t ie peace proposals among the allies,
lut has had no reason to believe that
the present proposals themselves will
at once point the way to peace.

WILLING TO DISCUSS

the public as to what this government
proposes to do.
English Feeding Changes.
By Ed L. Keen.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Loudon, Dec. 15. A steady increase
in sentiment that the allies in refusing
German peace plans should set forth
their own terms of peace, was manifest
here today. Notwithstanding the con
tinued illness of Premier Lloyd-George,
it is known that the allies, through the
foreign office, have already logon an
informal exchange of views on Von
Bethmann-Hollweg's proposals
There are three views entertained as
to the course which the allies should
adopt in answering the German note,
based on the realization that the en
tente powers must carefully avoid the
pitfalls of the Teutonic nations. Three
plans are:
First A blunt rejection of the note.
The advocates of this course are con
vinced that this will be the only way
in which to prevent the situation being
maneuvered to advantage by Germany.
Opponents of the plan hold, on the other
hand, that.it would be a serious mistake
not .to meet the issues raised by Vou
Bet lima nn-Hollweg.
Second That Germany name her
terms on the assumption that these
terms yet to be made known officially,
really may be worth considering and
might be considered without damage to
allied prestige.
May State Their Terms.
Third That the allies do not ask Ger
many's terms, but detail their own sen
timents as to peace; their terms and
conditions.
Suggestions made in the press of neu
tral nations and particularly develop
ment of such an idea in the United
MlateThas aided in developing senti
ment for this third course. Moreover,
it is seen by the news from Germany,
that the government did not expect a
favorable response to its proffer: there
fore Knglaud regards the main purpose
of Von Bethmann-Hollweg's proposals
as manifestly two-fold, to impress neu
trals and the German public. Advocates
of the policy of the allies listing their
tefms argue that in such a situation as
presented now, the entente have a splen
did opportunity to put before the out
side world as well as the people of. Ger
many whom they have always believed
generally ignorant of the real issues of
the war a clearest, definite united
pronouncement of the allies' aims and
purposes.
There was every indication today
that the allies will adopt their course.
It is fully expected that J.luyd
George will be sufficiently recovered
from his illness on Tuesday to give in
his speech before the house of commons
n more or less positive statement of the
allies' position.

German Advance Losing Momentum-Russian
Activ
ity Increases
London, Dec. IS. The allies have
made known in semi-official statements
their rejection of German-made peace
at this stage and today their armies
in the field were backing up that re
fusal by force of arms.
Statements from the cast indicated
winter has caused no let up in Russia's
Offensive in the Carpathians. Nor has
there been any diminution of the fight
ing in Rumania, The German advance
is slowly losing its momentum in the
face of the Rumanians' strong rear
guard resistance, made ns they retreat
to the strategic line of the Basau river.
Before long there will be complete
consolidation of the Buzau river line
of Rumanian defense with the Rus
sian Carpathian line of offense. Russia
is likely to reinforce this whole line
strongly.
Great interest was manifested here
in a dispatch from Paris connecting
op Monday's violent German attack
ou the French lines nearest Pasis with
Von Bethmann-Hollweg's peace pro
posals of the same day. The assault was
declared to have been carried out by
the flower of the German troops and
I with a force of probably 10,01)0 men.
The attack has not been specifically
mentioned in official statements.
Apparently bitter fighting is still go
ing on in Macedonia, with the allied
forces under General Herail continuing
satisfactory progress. England looks to
see division of German forces to aid
the Bulgarians here very shortly with
a consequent increase in the intensity
or' the fighting.
French Attacks Fail.
Berlin, via SayviHe wireless, Dec. 15.
Three vain attacks by French forces
on the west bank of the Meuse were
reported in today's official statement.
The assaults were directed against
trenches ou height No- .104 southeast of
Malencourt, captured by German forces
a short time ago. -
On the east bank of the Meuse the
French also repeatedly launched attacks
preceded by a strong artillery prepara
tion, which extended far into the ter
rain behind the lines.
Further "storming waves" frif?ed on
the Pepper Ridge.
Development of an attack on the
south slopes before Fort Hurdumout
was made impossible by the Germans'
destructive fire.
Germans Take Buzah.
Berlin, via SayviHe, Dec. 15. Bu.ah
has been captured by the German forces,
today's official statement declared.
" Under the most unfavorable weath

"the allied troops rival each other in

GRANT SAFE CONDUCT
London, Det 15. According
to the request of the I'nited
States, the allies have consent
ed to grant Count Tamowsky,
the newly appointed Austro
Hungarian ambassador to Wash
ington, safe conduct to America.
Count Tsrnowsky was appoint
ed ambassador to the I'nited
States to succeed the Count
Dumba, who returned to Vienna
because he wss no longer per
sona grata to America. The
I'nited States made known its
displeasure at Dumba's action
and he was recalled. When Tar
nowsky was appointed his suc
cessor several weeks ago, the
allies refused him safe conduct,
first on the ground that his en
tourage was entirely too large
to be bona fide.
America made formal request
for Tamowsky 's safe passage.
It remained unanswered and
second request was recently
made of England.

Eureka, Cal., Dee. 15 The exact
causes of the wreck of the I'nited
States submarine 11-3, which stranded
in the breakers of Humboldt bay, will
not bo known until on official investi
gation is begun by the naVy depart
ment. Lieutenant H. E. Bugseh and Lieu
tenant Kric F. Zeemke, officers of the
diver, and Lieutenant Commander Howe
commanding tho submarine flotillri, ab
solutely refused today to discuss for
newspapermen the details off the mis
hap. One of the members of the rescued
crew, however, gave the I'nited Press a
graphic story of the experience.
"We knew that we were in the vicin
ity of Eureka but we could see only a
short distance from the boat," he said,
"The fog was very dense and we moved
slowly, even though we thought our
ship well out from shore.
"Suddenly there came a scraping,
followed by a heavy bump which threw
us all to the floor of the boat. "By the
time we found out the trouble, the ves
sel began to careen. It rolled tremend
ously, milking it impossible for us to
stand or to make deck. It seemed that
every moment the craft would turn tur
tle, so fearfully did she roll and pitch.
"We lashed ourselves to the nearest
objects on the vessel. Finally, after
the tossing ceased somewhat, we made
deck and signaled to shore, but could
acocmplish little because of the tre
mendous roll which was so heavy that
the periscope touched the water fre
quently. Our wireless apparatus WnS
useless anil our efforts to signal with
the whistle proved ineffective.

"Finally, us the fog lifted, one of the
boys got on dock and announced that
he could see people on shore and that
they seemed to be signaling to us to
keep up our courage. Then the fearful
rocking began again and we had to get
under deck, I'ltimnlely this rolling in
the surf brought water into the interior,
