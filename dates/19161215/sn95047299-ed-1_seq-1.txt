y STRUNZ DIES
OF HEART FAILURE
Was Prominent Palatka At
torney and Wealthy
Realty Owner.
25
Henry Strunz, Esq., for some
years a prominent attorney of this
city, died about 10 o'clock on Tues
day night of heart failure at his home
qn Third avenue.
Mr. Strunz had complained some
during the day of feeling poorly and
spoke of his disinclination to go to
his orange grove in San Mateo to
make out a bill of lading for a ship
ment of oranges. He went, however,
and attended to his business, return
ing about dark. He made the trip
in his automobile, and felt much
worse on his return. He went to
his home and sent for Dr. Geo. E
Welch, who was with him an hour or
more.
Dr. Welch .said that when he reach
ed his patient about six o'clock his
pulse was low about 56 but that he
administered restoratives and when
he left there was a reaction toward
normal, with the pulse at about 70,
"I sent some medicine up from the
drug store, said Dr. Welch, "and ex
pected to go back to him in an hour
or two, but I was called on another
serious case and it was nearly eleven
before I was again free. I went to
my home and there learned that a
hurry telephone call had been sent
for me about ten, which I immedi
ately felt was from Mr. Strunz
went immediately to his house and
found him dead. He had expired
about 10 o clock.
Mr. Strunz was unmarried and lived
alone, but an old colored woman who
does his house work had been in the
habit of staying with him nights
when he had these sinking spells
She had gotten him up-stairs to his
room and here it was that the fatal
attack came.
R. H. Cooper, who lives just across
the street was the first to arrive, but
he states that Mr. Strunz was breath
ing his last when he entered his room
Mr. Cooper immediately telephoned
to Drs. Welch and Johnson, and then
to other friends, all of whom of
course arrived too late to be of ser
vice.
The body was turned over to Moon
ey & Davis, who prepared it for bu
rial.
T. B. Merrill, one of Mr. Strunz'
close friends, sent telegrams to a
nephew living in Plainville, Conn., and
others to Joseph H. Spafford of New
York, a close friend and former law
partner.
A telegram in reply from the neph
ew, William F. Strunz of Plainville,
Conn., arrived Wednesday afternoon.
It simply requested that the body be
embalmed and held until his arrival
probably this morning. Arrange
ments for the funeral will be made on
his arrival.
Henry Strunz came to Palatka
about 25 years ago and associated
himself with Joseph H. Spafford in
the practice of law. After a short
time in this association Mr. Spafford
rutired and moved to New York, leav
ing his practice with Mr. Strunz. He
has practiced here continuously since,
hig practice being more that of a
councellor than as a pleader in the
courts.
He had invested heavily in Palatka
real estate and improved property
and at the time of his death his wealth
was conservatively estimated at about
$100,000.
Some three years ago he purchas
ed large orange grove interests on
the river front at San Mateo, and for
a year or more he has been gradual
ly giving more and more time to this
interest to the neglect of his law prac
tice. He ultimately intended to give
up his law practice altogether. His
grove consists of something more
than twenty acres of bearing trees
and his crop of fruit this year is a

THIRTY THOUSAND
ACRE CATTLE RANCH
Is the Latest Proposed In
dustry for Putnam
County.
Among the most important docu
ments filed for record with County
Clerk Hutchinson in some time is a
contract entered into between R. L.
Dowling who is interested in the
Southern Cattle Feeding Company of
Columbus, Ohio, wherein the Clay and
Putnam Land Company agrees to sell
to the former some 45,000 acres of
land in Clay and Putnam county for
forming and ranch purposes. Of this
amount nearly 30,000 acres are in
Putnam county, stretching west from
Bostwick to Harlem and the Clay
county line and extending south to
Rice Creek.
The Southern Cattle Feeding Com
pany of Columbus already has a 60,
000 acre ranch in Clay county, and
this latest purchase is to be added.
The company already has more than
25,000 acres in Clay county under
fence, and over 6,000 acres fully
cleared. Corn and other crops rais
ed by the company on this cleared
land during the past summer took
hrst premium among the county ex
hibits in the last Ohio State Fair.
The president and active manager
of the ranch is S. E. Strode, formerly
dairy and food commissioner of Ohio,
and one of the directors is Homer C,
Price who only a few months ago
retired as dean of the Ohio State
University of Agriculture. R. L
Dowling and W. T. Shands of the
Dowling-Shands Lumber Company of
ureen Cove Springs, Fla., are respec
tively treasurer and secretary.
Mr. Strode was raised on a farm
and is a practical farmer. For four
years he was secretary of the Ohio
State Grange, for four years lecturer
of the State Grange, eight years As
sociate Editor of the National Stock
man and Farmer, eight years lectur
er and demonstrator for the Ohio
State Board of Agriculture, for two
years member of the Agricultural
Commission of Ohio and for two
terms dairy and food commissioner,
Certainly there was no reasonable
element of doubt in Mr. Strode s cal
culations when he decided to leave the
great state in which he had become
so important a factor to cast his. lot
in Florida.
The company's plan is to have a
permanent herd of about 3,000 select
breeding cattle. To do this it will be
necessary to purchase about 6,000
head of range cattle, having 1,000
head now. This will give the com
pany 7,000 head from which to make
its selection. For grading up the
stock and improving the quality the
company will use 30 pure bred bulls.
It will also stock its pastures with
high grade hogs.
For work horses heavy brood mares
are employed. Under the plan of op
erations these will be busy only about
six months in the year and they will
be bred to jacks, giving the company
fine lot of mules for which there
is a good market in Florida and ad
joining states.
It estimates its gross earnings at
$127,500 a year and its net profits
at $47,500 to which will be added a
very handsome increased in land val
ues.
The company has the advantage of
good water and rail transportation,
being near the St. Johns river and the
Atlantic Coast Line, one of the most
progressive rairoads in the country
which gives every possible encourage
ment to new industries established in
its territory.
Should this purchase be consum
mated, as it undoubtedly will be, the
business of the company will be great
ly enlarged over the figures given
above, which were those planned for
its already established ranch in Clay
county, of which the Putnam county
purchase will adjoin and become a

Mr. Strunz was an alumnus of
Yale College and was about 56 years
of age. He was a fine gentleman
and was held in the highest esteem
by those in this city whose good for
tune it was to know him well. He
was charitable in his views and acts,
and many a needy soul has reason to
bless his name for aid.
Late on Wednesday afternoon,
County Judge Haskell caused the safe
in Mr. Strunz' office to be opened in
hope of finding a will. One was
found but it had also been destroyed
by having the signature torn out
Whether he made a subsequent will
or not is not known, and will not be
until the arrival of his nephew this
morning but it is thought he did not.
Mr. Strunz had no immediate rela
tives and his estate will likely go to
his nephews living in Connecticut.
For more than a year he had known
that his condition was serious and
had been under the care of a physi
cian. He frequently talked of it to
his friends, though because of his vig
orous appearance few were inclined to
credit it and some there were who
suggested that his condition was
largely a matter of imagination.
In the destroyed will found in Mr.
Strunz' safe his largest bequest was
to Yale University, which was to have
one-fourth of his estate. .Each of
his several nephews and a niece were
to receive bequests, and Jos. II. Spaf
ford of New York, who was name.!
as executor, was to receive $o,000.

Secretary.
The Palatka Athletic Club, The Palat
ka Public Library, St. Mark's church
and perhaps some other local organi
zations were each to receive bequests
of $1,000 or more, and like be
quests were to go to eld friends,
among whom were Mrs. Gov. F. Peek
of DeLand, and Mrs. Parker H.
Smith of Jacksonville. That Mr.
Strunz intended to make another will
since his return from New York sev
eral weeks ago is certain; he had so
told friends here, and the fact that
the old will, stripped of its signa
ture remaining in his safe is evidence
that he retained it simply for guid
ance in making the new deposition.
Unless a new will is found, the estate
will go to his nephews and a niece,
of whom there are known to be four
of the former at least, and one of the
latter.
The problem of what to do for
Christmas spending money isn't both
ering the many people in this city who
had the foresight to start in the reg
ular, every week savings plan offered
early in the year by the State Bank
of Palatka.
The scheme was first tried by this
bank a year ago, and was so success
ful that it was repeated this year,
with the result that some $10,000 is
now being mailed in small checks to
these Christmas savers.
Of course some will not spend the
money, but will use it as the neucleus
for a permanent savings account. But
the many will regard their checks as
an account specially accumulated for
this season.
"No, it don't pay the bank," said
one of the officials, except it be re
garded as advertising, and then I rec
kon it does. It requires an immense
amount of work and at this time one
of our accountants will be kept pretty
busy figuring interest and writing
checks. There is a great number of
these accounts, and I expect it will be
Monday or Tuesday before we get all
the checks mailed. Of the number
who 'began the accounts, a very large
per centage have kept them up to the
end. No, these accounts do not re
main until called for like other sav
ings accounts; we send each depositor
a check for his account with interest
up to date, and most of them will be
turned loose in Palatka stores."

PALATKA STORES EXCEL.
"I don't believe that in all my trav
els I have ever been in a city the size
ofPalatka where the merchants made
a finer exhibit of merchandise, espe
cially of merchandise suitable for the
Christmas trade."
This is a remark made to The News
by a gentleman of middle life, evi
dently a man of cosmopolitan habits
and culture, who was sitting in the
office of the Hotel James one evening
this week. He continued:
"I have just come from a stroll up
and down your business street and
have been looking in at the window
displays and have been in some of the
stores.
"Not only are the goods as choice
as in the larger cities, but there is
the variety as well. You have some
wonderful stores, and some of them
certainly have artistic window dress
ers. "The people of this city and the
surrounding country are certainly
blessed with a choice of selection
when it comes to Christmas gifts."
The Store With
the Xmas Spirit
Yes, indeed, this store fairly radiates
the Christmas spirit that feeling
which makes this the most joyous
season of the year. There is no
better place to buy Christmas gifts
for every member of the family
than right here. ,
