TOLEDO, LINCOLN COUNTY, OREGON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15th, 1916.
NUMBER 43
NEWPORT
lm meeting of the taxpayers
tf the County at Toledo on the
CQlto discuss the County Bud
geW expense f or Jthe ensuelng
wan a. &icai buuuwbb. u
a new departure such a
Ms had never been before in
Qua county. The County Court
ianritetl the people to meet with
titexa on the above named day
aad discuss the estimated cost
tor running the County for an
Oaeryear. The courthouse was
well filled with the taxpayers of
th county. Toledo was out in
Jaass, Newport sent a delegation
1 315 and South Beach of jsbout
15 in company with the Newport
&Jegatlon a committee of fivo,
Air. Irvin being chairman, Wy
?nx, Hartly, Kirkland and
J?Viyiue were the other members.
Me. Irvin was chosen as spokes
ntsu Mr. Waterbury was also
askwl to take a leading part in
th liBcussions. 'Each item in
the budget was taken up and
35ettirsBed. Mr. Irvin asked the
toast questions and the fire of
the audience seemed to be cen
tered on him and when the ques
tions didn't go to suit them some
tTssaXisfied person would shoot
a. mrestion at Irvin. But Sam
bad teen under fire before and
b stood the fire first rate. The
ftw tax limitation amendment
vaa up and discussed. Mr. Irvin
wta asked to explain the law, be
wasre he was a member of the
uREar-siaturo when the bill was
pressed. He got the law a little
raixMled but finally came out al
right after being asked several
Uaestlotis from the audience.
"Kms law doesn't have anything
to do with past indebtedness, but
oraj provides that a county can
ot create a new debt under the
feiv tf more than $5,000. This
seems to De tne proper con
struction of the law. This is a
Rood thine. Of all ills that af
tetl humanity this going in debt
fe the worst both 'for Individuals
Had the county as well. Some
exposition was made to . the
to wnd three-fourths mills levy
tor road purposes. One or two
sm&kers said it would work
hardship on the timber owners;
but 'when we consider the men
lrt uy and own large bodies
of Umber are wealthy and buy
the timber for speculation they
sore the last ones that should be
fcvTored with reduction of taxes.
Th rancher: the farmer who
vhh Mb family is trying to build
u borne In this rough and moun
tainous coast country should be
b-rjd to build roads and bridges
ao lie can market his produce,
baSVi school houses, establish
roieinunities so he can educate
bb children and let in the light
of civilization and happiness in
these dark places. The timber
fcnWcr Bhould bear his share of
Vfcus expense with out squealing.
The County Judge put this ques
tion: 'Shall the levy for road
imrposes 5 mills be reduced?"
The Tore was unanimous against
tho reduction I believe one
wstn however had the courage
. to rise and vote against it. When
the Umber owners get ready to
xnove that timber they will do it
and a few thousand dollars one
mj or the other will not make
ny difference. The basis of our
prosperity is with the farmer.
We need better roads, more peo
"pSe, more creamerys, more fruit,
xnore stock, more vegetables,
. better homes and more work to
thfwelop our resources. I don't
fciiow what the County Court
"wEl do, but I am quite certain
' the people want the county out
of debt. The best thim? no
iloufrt would be to pay of the
county's indebtedness which U
now about $66,000 with work
Toagh to keep up repairs. This
1 think would suit the people.
When the county or city is in
Oebt and warrants are at a dis
count It leaves room for money
ed men to speculate off the peo
IjJb the men who do the work
and ought to have the money.
Yhen warrants are at a discount
wwa who have the money buy
them up at a discount of ten per
cent or more on the dollar and
to warrants are not taxable and
. sua they draw six per cent Inter
val, the man who holds them
eaves all the way from sixteen to
twnnty .per cent on the dollar
and such men do but little of
anything to improve the county.
I believe it a God send that a
limit of $5,000 is put on each
county. It is a thing to be proud
of to say your county is out of
' debt. I think the meeting at To
ledo will do good. The people
now understand better than ever
what the Court is doing and how
their money is being spent.
Boomers, exploiters and graft
ers should have a cold shoulder
shown them in this county. It
goes without saying that every
county in this state has suffered
more or less in this way. Such
people are the curse of the coun
try.. Amos Kisor has gone to the
Valley to visit his friends and
relatives. He will go as far as
Portland before returning home.
Monday evening at the Mid
way theatre a musical program
was rendered for the benefit of
the city park. The use of the
building was donated by Mr.
Freeland and the music was also
furnished free. The seats were
all taken and the audience had
an enjoyable time. The Pickins
orchestra furnished the music.
Vocal solo, Miss. Ina Irvin; Eu-
calo, Miss James and Miss Anna
Mahall, vilephon, Mrs. Black,
monologue, Mrs. E. J. Hartman;
vocal solo, Miss Alda Berry; male
quartette, My .Old Kentucky
Home. These old melodies nev
er loose their pathos and beauty.
It turns us back to the old
homes we left fifty years ago,
where the opossum and the ra
coon came to our chicken roost
and the mocking birds sang be
neath our cabin windows. It
makes us sad to think of these
happy days long passed by. Rev.
G. T. Pratte acted as master of
ceremonies.
News came to Newport Sat
urday that Samual Hill had died
at his home Friday after a long
illness, aged 77 years, 8 months
and 6 days. Mr.tHill took up a
homestead on Beaver Creek
nearly 40 years ago and lived
there continuously to the time of
his death. His was an interest
ing career. He came West in
the fifties, was a miner in the
early days in California and
Southern Oregon, was in several
of the Indian wars, had numer
ous hair breadth escapes from
being maBacred and had passed
through the struggles and dan
gers of pioneer life. He was a
man of stearling worth, a good
citizen, kind husband and in
dulgent father. He is survived
by his wife and an only daugh
ter, Mrs. Hester Hill Coovert.
His remains were laid to rent in
the Fern Ridge Cemetery Bur
rounded by his neighbors and
friends with whom he had lived
for more than a quarter of a cen
tury. The grangers conducted
the funeral services of which or
der he was an honored member,
