OKLAHOMA CITY. Iec. 1 I. Lep.
rosoiitaltv es of all the railroads op
erating ill the state were here today
at the hearing of the corporation
commission on a proposed order to
modify an order Issued by the com
mission several months ago relative to
the charging of I cent extra where
passengers boarded trains not having
purchased tickets They vigorously
objected to reducing the charge.
When the order allowing the charge
of the extra cent was made, several
things were considered by the com
mission and tlie order was allowed
rather on condition that the railioads
do other things they were not doing.
Complaints were sent to the commis
sion asking that the roads be roipilrol
to keep one door of all the coaches
open for egress or Ingress. Traveling
men especially complained about the
rule of the roads to reiulre each pas
senger to snow tickei ueioro eiueruiK
the cars.
When the order was made finally
it nllowed the roads to charge the
1 cent extra where a passenger had
failed to buy a ticket, but required
the opening of a car door at every
car, and prohibited tho rule of show
ing tickets before boarding the train.
Complaints came to the commis
sion that the railroad companies were
not conforming to the order. It was
complained that In some cases proper
facilities for passengeis buying tick
ets were not maintained.

CONGRESS TO VOTE

Advocates Win Victory in

WASIIINHTON, Dec. II. Woman
sufl'ruge advocates won a partial vic

Susan II. Anthony federal amendment
voted on In congress today when the
house Judiciary committee reported
tho measure for consideration without
recommendation. A campaign now
will be launched to get a special rule
to bring the amendment before tho
house for action pruhubly some time
in January.
Doth suffragists and nntisiiffragists
expressed satisfaction over todays de -
Velopmeul unit are coiitiueiii oi vic

tho resolution be reported favorably
the suffragists were pleased because
tho committee which generally was
regarded ns hopelessly against their
cause went as far as it (lid. On the
other hand their opponents declare an
onuortunltv to have the house vote on
tho issue Inevitably means a defeat for
suffrage which will settle the question
nniloniillv for many years.
The vole In favor of reporting tho!
resolution, 11 to X. does not represent
the sentiment of the committee on the
Issue. Some of Its bitterest enemies
voted favorably, most of them confi

and desirous of quieting charges of
"smothering" in committee.

asserted lieio tonight before the

The senator declared that he wished
I' distinctly uinlcit.tooil that he spoke
on his own personal responsibility,
but said he laler might speak "In an
other form" on whether any neutral
or group of neutials "should attempt
any aflitiualive action to end Hie

"There have been times," he con

such things give us some right of our

SUICIDE VICTIM NOT OF
THE BON TON MILLINERY
Woman Wlio Died Was Proprietress
of Hon Man he Parlor mi
Main Street.
The woman who recently commit
ted suicide at the I. uxor hotel was
proprietress of the Hon Murchc mil
linery parlors on Main street until a
short time before her death, but was
In nowise connected with Ihe Hon Toll
millinery. The Impression has gone
forth that she operated the Hon Ton,
due no doubt to the similarity of the
names. The Hon Marehe wont out ot
business some time since. The Hon
Ton is operaled by Mrs. Kate Hust
and Miss Willla Cowan, both of whom
have been greatly annoyed during Hie
past few days by people calling ihcm
up to find which one was the suicide
victim.

In each case those found guilty of

Probably the most bold seekers of

with the briskness of the weather was

proposals of the ceiilial powers would
not be flatly rejected without ex
amination weie the oiistatidlug do

(lerinany's note substantially tho
same as the published text, arrived by
cable in the early hours of the morn
ing and Just as the slate department
was closing for the day. Austria's nolo

was Iileiiltcal Willi lierioaiiy's and that
neither contained any change 111 mean

It was stated ofucially that neither

Indication that the . readout had
made up his mlml what action If
any he would take in transmitting the
central power proposals to Hie entente
belligerents.
Altitude Moderates.
With the ii ii ii ii i incut of the
Ci no in proposals two days ago It ap
peared that the entente allies were in
clined to reject the offer flatly. It ap
peared very I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 If President
Wilson could find a way to add a
word of iiii'di.itlon lu transmitting the
notes. With the apparent moderating
ol that fust altitude as reflected in
the Hrltlsh now spa ioi. s and among
the entente diplomats here, tho way
seems easier for the president to ex
press 111 suie way tlie llopo of the
I lilted Stud that the proposal for a
ilisi iisioii of peace will not be rejected
without consideration. In such a step
there Is a likelihood of the I'nited
States being supported by some of tho
Km open n neuti als. The minister of
one of them today nsked his govern
ment to authorize him to assure tho
president of indorsement lu such a
move and il Is behoved others are con
sidering the sumo phase of tho situa

Conferences Held.
The Spanish (itnhassador.JNfr. Ttinno,
and tlie Swiss minister. Doctor Hitter
both conferred today with Secretary
Lansing. Their government's also lire
acting as Intermediaries In transmit

cussed tho prospect of a neutral con
cert was not disclosed but the Im
pression prevailed that In tho absence
of a decision by President Wilson tho
siil'led was scarcely moro than
touched upon.
The change In the attitude of the
entente embassies, however, was re
garded as the most Interesting de
velopment pointing to the probable
position of the allies. It was Indicated
that to avoid being placed In tho posi
tion of flatly rejecting peace overtures
Without knowing what Is proposed It
was not Improbable that after mature
deliberation among themselves the
allies would make reply, Inquiring
upon what basis a discussion Was sug
gested. Such an action by tho ullles,
it was pointed out, would not hy any

The Herman view ( I tho next prob

should be proposed for a gem ral dis
