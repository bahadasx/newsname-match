BE COMMUNITY
CHRISTMAS TREE
Commercial Club Will Stand
Sponsor for Annual Affair
Free Moving Pictures Form
Part of Program.
Cottonwood will have another
community Christmas tree on
Christmas eve. This decision was
reached Wednesday evening
when a number of the members
of the Commercial Club met and
arranged for the event to be re
peated again this year the same
as last Christmas. The occasion
last year proved such a success
that it was decided to repeat it
and committees are now at work
collecting money to defray the
expenses and arranging the de
tails for the occasion.
The entertainment will be given
at the K. of C. Hall on Sunday
evening and will consist of a free
picture show, followed by a short
Christmas progràm, after which
gifts of fruit, candy and nuts will
be made to everyone present.
Those who wish to may place pre
sents on the tree for their
friends. The entertainment will
start promptly at 7 o'clock and
will be completed about 9, thus
giving everyone an opportunity
of attending the community tree
and then attend to their private
arrangements at home.
The public generally is invited
to attend this entertainment and
it is the hope of the Commercial
Club that the hall be completely
filled for the occasion. Come,
and bring the little folks.
Will Platt Joins Benedicts
Will Platt and bride arrived in
the city Wednesday evening from
a trip to Portland and other out
side points and will leave
soon for their home across the
river. Mrs. Platt was formerly
Miss Vivian Jones, daughter of
Sam Jones of Boles, and has been
visiting for several weeks with
friends at Genesee. A couple of
weeks ago Mr. Platt went out to
attend the Lewiston stock show
and he and Miss Jones were
quietly married and then went on
to Portland for a short trip be
fore returning t o their home
across the river. Both are well
known and highly respected and
number their friends by hun
dreds. The bride has lived al
most her entire life in this coun
ty and is a young lady of fine
qualifications and charming per
sonality. The groom came here
a number of years ago from Gen
esee and engaged in the cattle
business across the river and to
day is considered quite wealthy.
He is a young man of fine char
acter and in every way worthy
of the lady of his choice. The
Chronicle extends hearty con
gratulations.
Word received from Mr. and
Mrs. A. A. Harrison and Dick
Haskin, who left recently by
auto for their homesteads in
southeastern Oregon, shows they
have been having a very strenu
ous time since leaving the prairie.
They ran into deep snow before
reaching Meadows, and had to
camp out by the side of their car
for two nights, afterward being
towed into Meadows, a distance of
eight miles, by a freighter.
Here they loaded the car onto the
P. & I. N. train and had it hauled
to Weiser, from where Dick es
sayed the task of driving across
country to their claims, the new
ly-weds going around by train.
This is a new way of enjoying a
honeymoon but we surmise most
people would prefer a little less
strenuous experience.
Orofino Has An Inventor
W. M. Peatman has invented
what may develop into one of the
biggest inventions of the year,
and not only put Orofino on the
map, but incidentally put Mr.
Peatman into the millionaire
class with a whoop. The new
invention is a differential, or
drive gear that will drive from
both hind wheels, and always
drive as long as one of
the wheels has any contact with
the road. Here is the situation.
Take any automobile, whether a
Ford or a $6,000 car, and on a dry
floor jack up either hind wheel.
Start the engine and you cannot
move the car. The loose wheel
turns while the wheel on solid
floor will not move. Mr. Peat
man has invented a gear that
overcomes this, and he can jack
up one wheel and pull it off. Ap
plied to mud one can see that in
mud a car is practically helpless
if either wheel gets into soft
ground even if the other wheel
is on solid footing. With the
Peatman patent a car can pull as
long as either wheel can get any
footing, and in a trial test Wed
nesday around Orofino with a
load of local auto owners the
Peatman Ford, equipped with
the new invention, walked thru
deep mud from the end of the
paving down to the depot and in
other parts of town.—Republican.
Rush Blindly On
Miss Ada Randall of this place,
who suffered the total loss of her
eyesight through sickness when
aged about 8 years, and George
Robinson, the blind piano tuner
of Nezperce, were married this
(Thursday) afternoon in the
parlors of the Ilo hotel, Justice of
the Peace L. J. Luscombe tying
the nupitial knot.—Ilo Register.
Grand Theatre Salem
The Reese Bros, players, who
are appearing at the Grand Thea
tre during the fair week, are
notably superior to any talent of
that character ever appearing in
Salem. The old humdrum jokes
and belated minstrel comics are
conspicious by their absence in
this show and each member of
the company is an artist in the
2 0th century entertainment.
Arthur Reese, an amusing con
versationalist, is one of the most
characteristic numbers of the
company, while Florence Blue,
Major Bailey and Jessie Reese
are blessed with beautiful voices
and their efforts are those of
players who are sincerely de
sirous of pleasing their audiances.
Jopie Murray is a dancer extra
ordinary. His antics are mirth
provoking, while at the same
time he is capable of some
amazing foot work. The tango
dancers are immense. Tom Davis
and Ollie Rees are clever end
men. The Reese Bros, are gun
jugglers with no superiors. The
show as a whole is first class.
The music is entrancing. They
will appear at the Grand during
the week.—Salem (Ore.) News,
Sept. 26, 1916.
Jim Rooke returned Wednesday
afternoon and Ira Robertson got
back the first of the week
from across the Salmon and
brought back some fine vension
which they have been handing
around among their friends. Jim
was over on his old stamping
grounds for about three weeks
and, while he only hunted a cou
ple of times, succeeded in getting
his full allowance of game while
Ira was also successful in landing
a fine buck. Tne snow is deep
over there, however, and hang
ing low on the trees and makes
hunting pretty difficult, while
there are many hunters in the
field and game hard to locate.
HELD A FINE
CONVENTION
Knightf of Pythias Met Here
and Had Enjoyable Time—
Vollmer Won on Degree
Work.
The Craig Mountain district
convention of Knights of Pythias
which was held in this Tuesday
evening was a decided success
from every point of view. About
seventy-five members of the or
der were present from the sur
rounding territory and degree
teams from the Vollmer, Ilo and
Culdesac lodges competed during
the evening, the former team
winning first honors and the Ilo
team taking second place. After
the degree work was completed
an elegant banquet was provided
by the Pythian Sisters, to which
all did ample justice. The work
of the convention was not com
pleted until after three o'clock in
the morning and many of the
visitors decided it was then too
late to think of sleep and whiled
away the rest of the time with
cards, music and singing. Cul
desac was selected as the place
for holding the next convention
and the date chosen was May
30th, 1917.

Wants No Fuss and Feathers
Inaugural balls are not in the
good graces of the incoming ad
ministration, so there will be no
flutter of society when the state
officials elect are sworn into office,
says a Boise dispatch. Governor
Alexander was not in favor of an
inaugural ball two years ago
when he was first elected. He
has not changed his mind now
that he has been re-elected. The
chief executive makes it very
plain that the people who ele
vated him to the highest office in
their gift are not the ones who
attend inaugural balls. He said
two years ago that elaborate ex
penditure of funds for balls to
inaugurate state officials could
better be spent in aiding the suf
fering on the battlefields of Eur
ope. With the war still in prog
gress he is of the opinion that
there are more serious problems
than official state balls to face.
Owing to the fact state officials
will not be inaugurated on the
same day the legislature con
venes the first instance of its
kind in the history of the state,
there will be two separate inaug
ural ceremonies. State officials
will be sworn in on Monday, Jan
uary 1, in the house of represen
tatives by Justice Alfred Budge,
who becomes chief justice with
the reorganization of that tribu
nal. Adjutant General Moody
will be master of ceremonies.
The governor and his staff, with
the public, will attend. The
ceremony will be brief. On the
following Monday, January 8,
the legislature will organize and
that evening a public reception
wi'l be held in the rotunda of the
new capital in honor of the solons.
There will be no dancing and the
reception is announced as in
formal.
Killarney Girls Pleased
The third number of the Red
path lyceum course, the Killar
ney Girls, appeared here Satur
day evening and proved very
satisfactory. They were greeted
by a large audience and the pro
gram rendered was the best so
far provided, the violin selections
being particularly fine and the
impersonations of Miss Rich of
a very high character. While
the program, as the name sug
gests, was made up almost en
tirely of Irish selections the num
bers were all well chosen and
capably rendered and the audi
ence was well pleased with the
entire program.
Thiesson Bull Brings $1,000
Portland, Ore., Dec. 9.—The
auctioneer sale o f pure-bred
