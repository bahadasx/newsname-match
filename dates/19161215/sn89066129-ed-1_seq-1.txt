One of the peculiar things about
antomobiling is that .accidents
always happen when the car is
running at a moderate speed. If
within the corporate limits of a
town the speed is never over ten.
miles an hour and on a country road
not to exceed twenty miles per hour,
always so declared by the driver if
he lives to tell the tale. No differ
ence if the car turns over sevens
times and is completely demolished,
or if it smashes down a telephone
pole and drives a hole in a brick
wall the speed is always within the
speeu law accoramg to tnose re-
sponsible 'for the accident. Yet
every day right here on the main
streets of Laclede cars are driven
by reckless drivers between twenty
and thirty miles per hour and no
effort made by-the authorities to
discourage the practice. There is
going to be a bad accident at the
bank corner some of these days
then there will be a vigorous ex
pounding of the law and digging
