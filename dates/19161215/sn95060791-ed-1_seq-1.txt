Proposed County Fair for Navajo
SUnder the above caption the
Snowflake Herald published last
week an editorial on the proposi
tion ot holding a county lair in
Nayajo county. The News re
prints the editorial in full and
will do all possible to bring such
an enterprise to a successfu
conclusion. We only differ from
the Herald in the location for
the fair; we think it should be
held in the county seat, but we
would be willing to concede this
point if found to be the will of
the majority of the people who
would contribute to the sue
cess of the fair. The Herald
article follows:
"The proposition of holding
fair in Navaio county has been
and is still being discussed by
the wideawake's of this part oÃ­
the county. That it would be
the greatest thing that ever
happened for the agriculturist,
stockman and others, cannot be
denied. It would be the means
of inducingirand encouraging
every fellow to do his "leve'
best" in trying to produce the
best in his particular line.
"Nothing of this kind has ever
been attempted in Arizona's
northern counties, '"Joutside of
Yavapai, and.', the' first year's
event probably could not be as
elaborate as desired, yet if the
Srst one proved a success, future
nes could branch out from time
me as the fair grew, f
Snowflake wouldbe the ideal
e for the holding of such an
rtainment, being situated
in the center of the county
our sister towns, and is al
right in the heart of the
ultural, fruit and liyestock
We have the climate,
water, and an abundance
ound suitable for pulling off
an entertainment. At a

Farm Association the mat-
Was discussed and all present
rtily favored the proposition.
But this, however, will not

et's all pull and boost for

I Christmas Parcels Early
e postomce department s
ing to "do mailing early"
ven out a few days ago by
aster Chas. Osborne. The
ing calls attention to the
that Sundays precede both
Christmas and New Year's holi
days. Here it is:
"Both Christmas and New
Year's are holidays and occur on
Monday, therefore, it is kindly
suggested vou complete mailing
your parcels, holiday cards, let
ters and gifts preceding the end
of the week before the holidays
so as to give us ample time to
make prompt deliveries. Do not
delay mailing your parcels and
we will not delay delivery to your
friends and patrons. The cor
dial aid of the public is solicited."
Resumes His Old Business
Henry Kruthott, a cook, was
arrested last Saturday night by
Undersheriff Harp upon suspi
cion of having intoxicating liquor
in his possession. He had come
in from the east on the midnight
train and had a suitcase with
him. When taken to jail the
suitcase was found to contain 24
pints of whiskey.
Monday morning Kruthoff was
arraigned before Justice Boyer
by County Attorney Jordan. He
pleaded guilty to a violation of
the prohibition amendment to
the state constitution, and was
bound over to superior court in
bonds of $500. He was remand
ed to jail, not being able to fur
nish bond.
Kruthoff served time in the
county jail several months ago
tor a similar offence. Less than
48 hours after the new prohibi
tion amendment had become law
by proclamation of the governor.
he started the business of boot
legging again.
Masons' Elect Officers
The local lodge of Masons held
i regular communication of the
odge, in the new temple last
Saturday night. The transac-
ion of routine business was fol
lowed by the election of officers
for the ensuing year. The elec
tion resulted as follows:
Worshipful Master, W. B.
Woods; senior warden, J. H.
Scorse; junior warden, C. H.
Jordan; secretary, L. C. Hen
ning; treasurer, Geo. W. Hen
nessey, trustees, Geo. W. Hen
nessey, J. L. faulsell and W. K.
Scorse.
The installation of these offi
cers, together with tnose yet to
be appointed by the master, will
take place at some date to be
announced later.
The new temple will be didi-
cated by the' grand master of
the grand lodge, Judge F. W.
Perkins, at some time in the
near future to be fixed by him.
Famous Horse Swindle
Case in Federal Court
No Opposition to School Bonds
At the school bond election
last Saturday there were 41
votes cast in favor of the is
suance of $8,000 in bonds for the
completion of the new school
house now in course of construc
tion. No votes were cast against
the proposition.

Renewed interest was mani
fested in the Smith Bros, horse
swindle case Saturday when
Deputy U. S. Marshal Weage, of
Phoenix, arrived in Flagstaff and
subpoeaned several Flagstaff men
to appear before the federal
court at Omaha, Neb., as witness
es in the case.
J. S. Smith, Smith Bros., and
the U. S. Live Stock Co., all one
and the same outfit, began opera
tions around Flagstaff in 1910 by
buying up several horse brands
from R. Gleason, Fred Volz, W.
H. Rice, C. A. Bond and others.
They then proceeded to advertise
extensively through the middle
states and by correspondence and
otherwise sold horses to ranchers
in those states far in excess of
the number of animals they had
purchased.
In order, as they thought, to
cover up the crooked work they
specified in all bills of sales that
the buyer was to come to Flag
staff and gather his own stock.
This many of the buyers tried to
do and all found that the horses
were not there or mavericks and
so wild and the range so rough
they could not gather them with
out expense far exceeding their
worth.
Proceedings were started in
the spring of 1914 against the U.
S. Livestock Co., and its officers
on the charge of misuse of the
mails and the trial now being
held is the culmination of a long
legal fight. Those who left for
Omaha Saturday were S. S.
Acker, J. D. Dunn, D. J. Cronin,
Thos. Eakin, B. C. Black and
Frank Fairchild.
It is understood that T. E. Pol
lock and Lee Doyle were sub
poeaned to appear at a later date.
