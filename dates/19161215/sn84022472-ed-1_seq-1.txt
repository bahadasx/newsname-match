eharged with having killed Margaret

how ; the accused, met- itser death.' He
claimed ' '. theV -accosed should have
more specific. jLnfbrmaJUon ; so , they
would know better how to frame their
defense. He' wanted to know if the

shot or pojsened or what method had
been used. ; State's Attorney Cum

formation he had in the complaint.
Hec declared if the state didn't know

that fact was more to the disadvan

Hartford, Dec. 15. The public utili

tion of the city of Bridgeport for a
flagman at the railroad crossing at
the Berkshire division tracks of the
New' Haven road at. Grand street in
that city! The commission held that
the present traffic there does not war
rant a permanent flagman and the
crossing is soon to be abolished with
the building of a new bridge. : :
Alderman Harry M. C'ark of the
Eights distrpct, recently introduced a
resolution which was adopted by the.
common council calling for the' es
tablishment by the railroad of a per
manent' flagman at that point.. A

horses caught on the crossing al Hall

fered "death when struck by a train

CRITICISM OF HIS
REGIME THE CAUSE
Friends ; Circulating Report
That Press of Business
Is Reason
-As a. result of the severe criticism
to which the . police department has
been subjected under the administra
tion of John C. Stanley, .president of
the ' board-1 of police commissioners,
which has Included . charges of in
competency, it is stated that Stanley,
although desiring reappointment will
not, obtain (the position, but will have
to' quit when his term expires Jan. .1.
Realizing- this, friends of the com
missioner have caused to be circu
lated a report that his duties as vice
president of the American "& British
Co. have assumed such proportions
that it precludes giving attention to
any affairs other than those atr"the
factory. . ,. .. . . ,
It is . understood 4 . that despite the,
present status of Stanley with the. po
litical powers-that-be,' Influential per
sons will attempt to prevail upon John
T. .King yto have Stanley reappointed.
Whether, or , not they have sufficient
inbuence remains to be' seen. , .
'Reports of Stanley's failure as a po
lice Commissioner aild the report that
he . is. slated, to go,', evidently have
greatly irritated him. , ..When v asked J

clare that although the letter received
by the sister stated that 3LIiss Pendle
ton,? a charming girl of 23 years who,
up - to a few months ago; had always
lived at. home, h. d procured employ
ment in New Tork; the family -despaired
of ever seeing her -again -
Beyond the fact that she was so well
nurtured in the ! home here and ; con
sequently; - is little equipped to fight
alone the battles with the world, as Jt
appears she has determined to do
rather than return to Bridgeport,
great alarm is felt for heir meptal
condition. : ,-; t Y ;?; ' :;;'
"About a month ago," said a close
friend of ,Mr. j Pendleton todays she
was found in a New Haven hospital
where ' she had been taken when she
fell in the street. 1 was thought b?
the physicians that she had possibly
been attacked by epilepsy! . Her con
duct since has led those closely as
sociated, with ; her to suspect 1 that
amnesic: tendencies 'have" developed. f
Should she be similarly attacked in
Kew York or any of, the larger cities
the likelihood of her condition might
never 'be, known. For this as well
as the other reasons tnat cause fooid
parents to locate missing children, the
utmost search will be made for her,. "
