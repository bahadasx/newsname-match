Prohibitionists Are Jubilant

Thirds to Carry.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. The
House judiciary committee today
voted to recommend adoption of
the resolution to submit a consti
tutional amendment forbidding
the manufacture and sale of liq
uor for beverage purposes In the
United States. Even the most
enthusiastic champions of the
amendment had not expected fav
orable action so soon from the
committee, which at the lac; ses
sion voted to postpone its consid
eration indefinitely.

Administration leaders, however,
believed that It will reach the Senate
In time for action this sesion. . Pro
hibition advocates are jubilant and
predict ultimate adoption of the reso
lution and reference of the amend
ment to the legislatures of the vari
ous states at a much earlier date than
they heretofore had hoped. A two
thirds majority in both houses Is re
quired. D. of C. May Dry Up
Coincident with the committee s acijui
ion on the amendment, the prohibi
tion issue was brought directly to the
attention of the Senate when the
Sheppard till to prohibit the manu
facture and sale of liquor in the Dis
trict of Columbia became the unfin
ished business to be kept before the
Senate until disposed of. As an
amendment to this bill. Senator Un
derwood has proposed a referendum
to the male voters of the District. Sen
ator Kern of Indiana has added a pro
posal that women also should partici
pate in the referendum.
Senate Divided
Sentiment in the Senate for and
'against the referendum appears to be
closely divided with a vote on the sub
jeet expected within a iff or two.
Discussion of the Sheppard bill af
forded opportunity for corn-rent on
the proposed amendment. Several
senetors, among tbeni Sheppard, Yard
aman and Owen, predicted triumph
for the cause of nation-wide prohlbi- j
tion in the near future.
Dry Question First
Hardly any one doubted tonight
that prohibition will be a dominant
legislative feature before the new
sixty-fifth congress ir the constitu
tional amendTent does not reach a
vote this winter. In the House before
the amendment can be taken1 up for
consideration a special rule must be
adopted giving it right of way. Repre
sentative Webb, chairman of the ju
diciary committee will ask for such a
1 rule early in January and endeavor
to press the resolution to cn early
vote.
Small Opposition
Seven members of the judiciary
committee voted against reporting the
prohibition amendment. They were

Pennsylvania, Walsh of Massachu

to the resolution at the last session,
voted this time to recommend its

President Wilson was urged late
today by the Rev. Clarence Wilson,

"DRY" QUESTION
' Germany Closes
American Case In
Behalf of Belgium
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON', Dec. 14. Consid
eration of Germany's note answering
the American protest against the de
portation of Belgians for forced labor,
received at the state department to
day, probably will be delayed while
the peace proposals of the Teutonic
powers to the entente allies are pend
ing. It has been intimated by officials
that all questions at issue between
the United States might be allowed
to rest at a standstill at least, until
the allies had an opportunity to con
sider the peace offer. .
' In view of the insistence by Ger
many that there has been no viola-
I tion or international law or of the
laws of humanity, it is felt here that
having gone already beyond the
bounds of diplomatic usage, jhe Unit
ed States cannot undertake any fur
ther step without most careful delib
eration. HUNT'S GAIN

DOUGLAS, Dec. 14. The sack con-1
taining nineteen ballots cast in Wilgus
precinct in Cochise county, at the
November election, thought to have
been lost and not officially counted,
was discovered today in the office of,
the county treasurer at Tombstone. j
It was explained that the sack had
become mixed with others which had

men were at work and had been stored :

state law. But for the contest on the
governorship the sack would not have

(By Review Leased Wirv)
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 14. The right 'of
a neutral which has suffered from the
effects of the European war, particu
larly the right of the United States to
initiate a movement for peace was
asserted here tonight before the
League to Enforce Peace by Senator
Stone, chairman of the Senate foreign
relations committee.
U. S. Has Suffered.
"Since the war has almost from the
beginning resulted in Continuing offen
sive attacks on the rights and dignity
of this sovereignity and inflicting in
calculable injury to our national inter
ests all of which we have borne with
patience because of our friendship for
the nations involved," said Senator
Stone, "it seems to me that after en
during these attacks and suffering
these losses for nearly tv.t) and a half
years, with no end yet in sight, that
we have a right, without regard to
any question of sympathy or humanity,
but solely on our own account and to
safeguard our own interests, appiach
the combatants as a mutual friend and
open negotiations with a view to the
re-establishment of normal internation
al conditions.

Altogether it was one of the most

their origin in the European war. To

SUFFRAGE WINS

to House Without Objec
tion, Where Its Fate May
Be Decided in January.
(Contfnuea From l ase One)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. Women
suffrage advocates won a partial vic
tory in their long fight, to have the
Sncan B. Anthony federal amendment
voted on in congress when the House
judiciary committee today reported
the measure for consideration with
out recommendation. A campaign will
be launched to get a special rule to
bring . the amendment before the
house for action, probably In January
Both Sides Happy
Both suffragists and anti-suffragists
expressed satisfaction over today's
development and are confident of vic
tory on the floor. Though anxious
that the bill be reported favorably
suffragists were pleased because the
committee, which generally was re
garded as hopelessly against their
cause, went as far as it did. On the
ther hand, their opponents declare
an opportunity to have the House vote
on the issue inevitably means a defeat
for suffrage which will settle the ques
tion nationally for many years.
The vote in favor of reporting thei
resolution, 11 to 8, does not represent
the sentiment of the committee on the
issue. Some of its bitterest enemies
voted favorably, much of them confi
dent of seeing It beaten on the floor
and desirous of quieting charges of
"smothering" in committee.
One element of the committee, head
ed by Representative Igoe of Missou
ri, sought vainly to prevent action.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 4. Arrival of both the German
and Austrian peace notes and broad intimations at the entente
allied embassies that the proposals of the Central powers would
not be flatly rejected without examination were the outstand
ing developments here today in the peace movement.
U. S. Gets Peace Note.
Germany's note, substantially the same as the published
texts, arrived by cable in the early hours of the morning, and
just as the state department was closing for the day, Austria's
note arrived. Secretary Lansing said it was identical with
Germany s and that neither contained any change in meaning
from the semi-official versions.
It was stated officially that neither Germany's nor Aus
tria's note would be formed before tomorrow, if indeed then,
and there was no indication that the President had made up
his mind what action, if any, he would take in transmitting
the Central Power proposals to the Entente belligerents.
Allies Reasonable sentatives of all of the belligerents
When with the announcement of should be proposed for a general dis

were inclined to reject the offer flat- j edly have expressed their comric Hon.

W'th the apparent moderatins of that j the allied diplomats, oa the other
nrsi attitude, as reflected in the Btit-
lsh newspapers and among the enten
te allied diplomats here, the way
seems easier for the President to ex
press in some way the hope of the j
Lnited States that the proposal for a
discussion of peace will not be reject
ed without considering. In such a
step there is likelihood of the United
States being supported by some of
the European neutrals.
Other Neutrals Aid
The Spanish ambassador Air. kiano
and the Swiss minister. Dr. Ritter.
both conferred with Secretary Lan
sing" today. Their governments also
were acting as intermediaries in
transmitting the proposals. Whether
they discussed the prospect of a neu
tral concert was not disclosed, but
the impression prevailed that In the
absence of a decision by President
Wilson the subject was scarcely more
than touched upon.
Hope Lies in Allies
The change in the attitude of the
entente embassies, however, was re
garded as the most interesting devel
opment pointing to the probable posi
tion of the allies. It was indicated
that to avoid being placed in the posi
tion of flatly rejecting the overtures
without examining what is proposed,
it was implied that after mature delib
era tion among themselves the allies
would make reply, inquiring upon
what basis a discussion was suggest
ed. Such action by the allies, it was
pointed out. would not bind them to
a conference.

. hand. Is that Germany's terms, as out-
lined by the Certnar embassy here
and as indicated by the tenor of the
German chancellor's speech, are such
that discussion would be fruitful of no
conclusion. But before approaching
that stage, they seem to agree that an
inquiry to the central powers for
more information of their proposal
would be proper- and that it will de
velop together for the next step.
J. P. Morgan, head of the financial
agents of the allies in this country,
consulted today with the British am
bassador. Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, and
the French ambassador J.iles Jusser
anl It was said his vk-it was a con
sequence of his recent conference ia
Europe with King George and some
of the British statesmen. Inasmuch
as his engagement with the two am
bassadors was made several days ago,
the conference, it was declared, obvi
ously was not brought about by the
peace proposals.
Wilson To Assist
So far as was known the President's
attitude remained undisclosed to any
of his advisors, but the belief grew
stronger that if in forwarding the pro
posals the American government did
not accompany them with more than
a forn-al note of transmission, it prob
ably later in some way would Indicate
Its Interest "in having peace discus
sions established as soon as possible.
Meanwhile the American diplomats in
the entente allied countries will be
expected to keep the government In
formed on official views.
Defines Opponents
The German note asked that the
United States "be so good" as to send
it on to France. Great Britain. Japan,
Russia. Serbia and Rumania.
The Austrian note asks the United
States to trhnsmlt to the same na
tions as the German note, except that
Belgium was substituted for Rumania.
That Japan was included was noted
