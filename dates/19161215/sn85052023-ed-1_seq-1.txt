is a very important office, und one in
i which each nnd everv tnx nnvnr of the
' . I
, th county is, or should be interest-
ed, nnd a man to fill that office
should be selected because of his
qualification and fltnesi for the office,
nnd not because of some insincere

myself in fnvor of increasing the pay
for work done on trie dirt roads of the
county to "G cents n day for a hand
and not less than $:2.(I0 for wagons
and teams. You, will notice that I did
not say thnt n man with n wagon and
tentn should not be pnid more, but
that "they should not be paid let.s."
My opponent nnd friend, T. A. Rice
declares in his announcement thnt ho
is in favor of paying hands SI. 00 nnd
wagon nnd teams $2.00 for each
day ot 10 hours. '
Now at the time I made my an
nouncement I happened to know the
law of our (date makes 8 hours a leg
al day's work on the public roads,
and my proposition to pay 75c nnd
S2.00 for 8 hours wort, amount to
about the same ns Mr. Ricu's propo
sition to pay $1.00 and $2.00 for 10
houis work. Mr. Rice forgets, or does
not know that a County Judge can
not make, amend or repeal our Stat
ute laws, and if he wants to thus en
gage, he should be a vandidatc for the
legislature instead of County Judge.
1 do not pretend to say that 7f cents
for n man and $2.00 for u man and
team is enough, considering prevail

ly vote as- u member nf the fiscnl

man with a team $"1.00 for each day's
work of 8 hours each, but the finan
cial condition of our county would
not now justify theVe prices, and it
would be but piping of n hypocrite
- I
i 'ind the braying of a demogoirue to
make promises that I could not ful

islature 1 procured the passage of a
law authorizing the fiscal courts of
the state to furnish tools" to be used
on the dirt roads, nnd if elected
County Judge I will be in fnvor of
furnishing n reasonable number of
suitable tools to be used on tho dirt
i roads of our county.
Large sums have been spent in ma-
! chinery to be used on the nikes and
, I o no good tenson why those who
I have to keop up the dirt roads should
'not lie furnished tools to do the
work. The prices paid hands on the
roads are t-mnll enough to pay for tho
labor alone, without having to fur
nish tools. I hope I hnve mndo my po

Tho marriage of Rev. C.'E. Wyatt,
pastor of the Christian church nt
this place and Miss Myrtle Murray,
wns solemnized on Friday afternoon,
Dec. 8th, In thnt church. The beauti
ful nnd Impressive ring ceremony
wns performed by Rev. Horace Kings
bury, of Danville, an old schoolmate
and chum of the groom. The maid of
honor wns Miss Mac Cnmpbell, of
Danville and the best man was Harry
Collier of this place. Tho bride was at
tired In a blue charmcusc dress of
latest style and enrried a boquot of
bride's roses and looked her sweet
est. Rev. Wyatt as pastor of the
church here needs no write-up ns ev
eryone known so well the great work
ho has nccomplishcd for the church
during his charge over it and those
who know the bride best feel that he
has chosen wisely nnd well. Myrtle,
ns president of the Christian Endeav
or society here had few equals in the
work nnd endenrcd herself to the
little ones by her efforts for their
ndvnncemcnt. For six years she had
made her home with Mr. and Mrs. R.
L. Collier, who took great pains to
give her every advantage socially.
She is a girl of fine sense, good taste,
economical nnd practical and will cer
tainly be to him n loving helpmate.
Roth bride nnd groom were recipients
of many useful and handsom presents
which would have numbered many
more hail thi-ir friends been posted
us to the wedding day, but it was
such a carefully guarded secret that
few if any knew about it until the
day before.
After receiving congratulations nt
Mrs. Collier's from their wide circle
of friends and partaking of an ele
gant lunch, they were motored to
Stanford, where they took the train
for Louisville. After a visit to ho
groom's family at Valley View near
' Louisville, they will leave Jan 1st,
for Ocala, Fla., where Rev. Wyatt
will have charge of n church next
year. In bidding good bye to these
two we with others feel that church,
Sunday School and Endeavor Socetj,'
sustain n great loss, but wi hpe
their joyful beginning of life will nt
its c!oe be brighter still.
On Christmas eve the Junior En
lleavorers will entertain from half
past six until seven at the Christian
church, here. The -Baptist brethren
have kindly ngreed to have, their ser
vices begin a half hour later on Ijjis
account. Every member of the Juniors
must be present. This entertainment
is free and we hope a full house will
greetjthem, ns they-hnVc taken much
pains to present an interesting pro
gram. The leaders, Mrs. Sidles and
Mrs. George Stephenson have certain
ly worke'd hard for the advancement
of the little tots and they try their
very best to do as their leaders sug-1
gest.
