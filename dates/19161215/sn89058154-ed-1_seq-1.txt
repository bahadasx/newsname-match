The central powers have made
propositions of peece. The terms
are practically -everything to be
restored as at the outbreak of
war. It simply means a dog fall
with the Germanic powers on top.
It is not believed that the entente
powers will agree to a cessation
of hostilities that peace terms
may be considered. "
With all the cry of high prices,

do without that which is too high
for you to buy. An ordinary fair
liver would be foolish to buy a
$10,000 necklace. A rich woman
.would think it a trivial matter,
because she , was able. If you
cannot afford eggs at 40 cents, do
not buy, them. If you can afford
it, and want them, buy them.
So with everything entering into
the daily expenses of the house

to substitute. . " ''
Lively Runaway
Aa Alfred Smith was . driving in
Monday morning from his farm,' the
I. C. passenger was too near to risk
the lower crossing:, and he turned up
east of the railroad as. it passed,
when hia gentle (?) family horde took
fright and ran to the upper crossing,
and as the boggy struck the track on
a curve one wheel went down, throw
ing Mr.v Smith across the switch.
Fortunately he struck the ground on
a smooth place. When assistance got
to him he was unconscious, but came
to by the time he got home. Outside
of the shock he was not seriously

Letter From New York.
Following up the suggestions made
in y our columns some time ago as to
starting a stock company for the
raising of live stock in McNairy
couity, it may be said that this sort
of scheme is by no means news, al
though it is only recently that it' has
been talked of very much. The con
tinued high price ;of farm produce
, has revived many plans of that kind,
and several recent ventures are told
- of by the newspapers. I suggested a
capital stock of $50,000 for the Mc
Nairy corporation. I read in a Flor
ida paper the other day, of a farming
stock company recently organized in
Marion county, in that state, with a
capital Btock of $550,000, and Bince
then I read of a company in North
Carolina that has millions back of it,
organized to raise hogs and cattle and
general farm products, and there is
no doubt that the recently enacted
rural credits bill which provides for
loans to farmers on long time and at
low interest, will greatly stimulate
the formation of these companies.
Ten members are required to form a
liorrowinz company, and they can
get a loan amounting to half the
market value, of their land. Those
interested should write to the Secre
tary of the Treasury, Washington, D,
C for fuU information. . '
The tendency to produce everything
on a big scale is more and mors in
evidence every day.v When my father
was a lad he worked in a tanyard for
his father in Hardin county, and on, a
cousin, Dr. Gerry Sanders, I saw
where my father had worked in an
other tanyard. of which no trace now
remains except the little spring
branch where the water was pro
cured to run the vats. People ; used
to card their own wool, spin it and
weave it, and make their own shoes.
Now, the tanning of leather, carding
and spinning of wool, weaving, and
nearly everything else in the . way of
productive industry, is done on a big
scale by machinery not so well in
some cases aa it used to be, but much
quicker and even cheaper.
With big capital, the land of farms
can be better cultivated with less
money than is now possible. Steam,
electric and gasoline plows will do
more in an hour than a single horse
and plow can do in a week, and do it
better. . The water of floods will be
stored up to use in dry times, and the
planting and harvesting of crops will
be carried on by machinery better
and quicker than can be done by hand.
The markets will be better controlled,
the quality of produce improved, and
storage facilities increased so as to
distribute produce more evenly
throughout the various seasons. Sci
ence will make the farming interests
more independent of the weather,
providing drainage or protection from
floods in big rains, and irrigation in
dry seasons, as well as' protection
against frosts, plant diseases and in
sects. Food and clothing should be
come cheaper and better, aa man
learna to diversify his crops and pro
duce them at less cost. At the same
time, farm ' lands will increase in
value, and then a man who owna 100
acres in McNairy will be esteemed
aa well-to-do. An intelligent Mc
Nairian wrote me the other day: "I
am a poor man, and own 600 acres of
poor land, bat it is all paid for." I
hope that man will live to see his
land worth ten times its present price,
and to live the rest of his days in
plenty while a syndicate is working
his farm on shares under a long.lease
and paying him more each year than
he ever made from it. , .
And what will the average farmer
do then? Let's see about that. -He
will be getting more money from his
land, and bis living will cost him less
that is, hia food and clothing. It
will require fewer people to do the
work, and a lot of land owners will
have plenty of time to run around in
their automobiles or air-planes, see
ing sights and learning the secrets of
Jature and of all sorts of science.
Many of them will make the mistake
of coming to live in a great beehive
of humanity like this, and their lives
will be shortened thereby. Tbey will
be prosperous, but will it make them
happier or better?

LITTLE GIRL NOW . ,
PLAYS LIKE OTHERS
Capt. T. M. Harrell says Tanlac
'gave his child health. x
"It wouldn't be doing right not to
tell you what your medicine has done
for-our little girl," said Captain T. M.
Harrell, of Atlanta, conductor on. the
Seaboard Air Line for 25 years and
rone of the most popular men in the
service. '
'"She's 11 years old," he continued,
"and has been a little sufferer all her
life weak, puny, nervous, no appe
tite, no control over her kidneys and
had headaches almost all the time.
"The child never was strong, even
from the cradle, and when she got a
little older and wonld try to play with
the other children and was too weak
to romp and keep up with them, it just
didn't seem rig1 1. for ' she seemed so
anxious to be with them and do aa
they did. It made me mighty sad and
brought many a big lump into , my
throat to see her that way, and some
how I could never get used to it.
"There was nothing on earth too
il-'yi ivi. iirt, ui'-'j vttc '-i:u r v c: jt
we could think of to try and rid her
of the pains and weakness and make
her like other children; but nothing
seemed to do her any good.
" It has always been a great worry
to get something for hpr to' eat that
would agree with her, and it was dis
heartening job, too, for almost every
thing would give her heartburn or
sour stomach or cause her to wake up
in the night with pains. We'd try
first one thing -after another, and
when everything would fail we would
feel disheartened and helpless.
"There is nothing quite so opprea-
aive aa a feeling that getahold of you
when" a little one of your own 1 flesh
and blood is sick and helpless and de-f
pending on 'you, and you can't find
anything on earth to help them.
"I saw in the paper where Tanlac
was helping so many women and
elderly people with delicate vital or
gans, and who were in weak and run
down condition, and as I studied over
the matter I didn't see why it
wouldn't help children; so I got the
child a bottle, for I believed it was
the right thing.
"I just cau't tell you how much
good it has done her, for she seems
like a different' child. She's picking
up weight and strength right along,
has control over her kidneya and sleeps
and eats as well as any youngster I
ever saw. " -
"Tanlac has given ray diild health
and happiness, I do believe, anji I don't
think there is anything like it in the
world. She now plays and romps like
the others and is just crazy abont her
Tanlac. Just now she phoned me
from our home in Ingleside to be sure
and get her a new bottle.
"She goes to school now, is jolly
and playful and enjoy j Ijfe."

THE FIRST STEP
Usually the first iudication of a
lowering of health is found in the
bowels and liver. Something goes
wrong we eat too much, or work
too hard and . the bowel action
weakens or the liver is sluggish.
That heavy feeling on arising in
the . morning, dryness of the
throat, with bad taste, a slight
headache, dull eyes all show that
food has fermeiUe 't in the intca
tines, and that tho body is man
ufacturing poisons instead' of
good blood. - '
Clear it all out Give n the
stomach and bowels a fresh start.
Encourage tho liver to go to
work. Manalin does all of this,
without griping or weakening.
It's the 'ideal laxative and .-liver
tonic, because it follows Nature's
plan, without discomfort, inllara
mation or forming a habit. Con
