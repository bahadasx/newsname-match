Legality of Union Organizations
is to Be Passed On by the
Federal Supreme Court
LABOR IS INTERESTED
Right to "Picket" Peacefully is
r*.. t n />

(?? askwCiatcd mcsai
WASHINGTUN, Dec. 2 5?Dabor
questions involving the legality of
union organizations, their right to
peaceful "picket" and liberty of contract
were argued Friday before the
supreme court.
In two West Virginia cases the'
court reviewed decrees by Federal
J Judge Dayton, finding the United,
Mine Workers union and the Ameri-j
can Flint Glassworkers' union il- 5
legal organizations, and also combinations
in restraint of trade under
the Sherman law. Judge Dayton issued
broad injunctions respectively j
to the Hitchinan Coal and Coke Coin-!
pany, of Wheeling, against the mine
workers' officers, including Secretary
Wilson of the department of labor,
who was formerly secretary-treasurer,
and to the Eagle Glass Manufacturing
Company, of Wellsburg, against
the glassworkers' organization.
Judge Dayton's decrees and Injunctions
were annulled by the Fourth
rlrr-nlt r?nnrt nt* finnhnlu ftnH fVto nnr
porations' injunction suits ordered
dismissed. The companies then appealed
to the supreme court.
Labor interests have been closely
watching both cases more recently!'
because questions are presented in- j
vo'ving contractural freedom. Both
"West Virginia companies operating
"open shops" have contracts with
employes not to join a union. They j
sought to restrain union solicitation j
even by peaceful persuasion and ar- j
gument of their workmen, contend- j
ing that such solicitation Interferes j
-i? with constitutionality liberty of con- j
tract. The circuit court upheld 1
union rights to peaceably "picket"
and persuade such workmen without
intimidation or violence.

Then Disagree.
A jury in the case of Gabor Nogy,
a, loreigner cnargeu wn.n violating
the prohibition law, failed to agreed in
the criminal court Thursday afternoon

of a paid stool pigeon for A.
,T. Findley, prosecuting attorney- A
few weeks ago Wamsley went to one
of the suburbs and running across
Nogy corhplained that he was ill and
needed liquor badly. The foreigner
told him that he had no whiskey but
Wamsley begged so hard for liquor
that the fellow to oblige an American
finally took Wamsley's money and
purchased liquor for him. Shortly
after that the foreigner was arrested, j
It was told the jury that Warns'ey i
was" to be paid $3 by Findley for the
service in this case as stool pigeon
and it was argued that Findley himself
was a party to the frame-up.

CHICAGO, Doc. 15.?Wheat crashed
down In value Friday on account ol
peace reports. First sales showed a
fall in some cases of eight and fiveeights
cents a bushel. May wheat
touching 51.58 as against 51.66% tc
$1.65% at Thursday's finish.
"What chieflly sent prices whirling
downward was the statement authorized
by the German embassy in Washington
that one of the most importani
subjects for discussion at a peace parley
would be universal disarmament
Besides the German embassy statement
the smash in wheat prices was
due largely to Thursday and Friday
morning's break in the New York stocn
market Thursday's big decline in 'New
York came too late to have much influence
hero until Friday.
The decline made a total drop In
wheat prices of about eighteen cents a
bushel since the first peace ofTer came
from Berlin.
Within an hour losses had been widened
to ten and live-eights cents a
bushel. May wheat tumbled to $1.56
In the closing out of accounts, as
compared with prices a month ago
the market at this stage was down
more than forty-five cents a bushel in
