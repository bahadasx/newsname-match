STARTLING STATEMENT
OF MANY MURDERS
TEN YEAR OLD BOY ACCUSES PARENTS OF CRIME
KlKilfl Invcstlg,,!, and rinds Ao Kvi.lcnce Htiuportinic hrKeH Deplor
ablu Condition Wus lilst'losm! However.
Tho arrest and trlul of Edward
Guy und Wllllum Hurrls for trapping
without a license lias brought out
some startling evidence which gives
a number of problems for the olTiceis
of the law to solve. So far as can
be learned, the stories originated
with a Mrs. Johnson, who, It seems,
is not on friendly terms with the Gay
family. The bitterness existing be
tween the families was caused by
Mrs. Gay's objection to Mrs. John
son's brother, Edward McFall, being
attentive to Hazel Gay, aged 14
)ears. It seems that Mrs. Johnson
resented tho Interference of the girl's
mother, end aided tho girl in her
preparation for leaving home. The
girl and McFall went to Kalama on
November 2 and were married, the
witness, whom Sheriff Stanwood Is
now looking for, and the bridegroom
swearing that the girl was of legal
ago and resident of Oak Point, Wash.
After the wedding the couple left for
Centralin, and McFall has been em
ployed In a logging camp near that
pluce since. A few weeks ago Mrs.
McFall wroto to Mrs. Johnson, and
among other things said "if old ludy
Guy" (her mother) got too gay she
would squeal about the beaver trap
ping. Mrs. Johnson sent the letter
to Sheriff Stanwood and he and Coro
ner White with Deputy Game Warden
Brown began an Investigation. '. '
Clarence Gay, the 10 year old son
of Mr. and Mrs. Gay, broke into the
limelight when he told the officers
that his mother had killed a man
nunied Harris, who was working on
:ho highway and later helped his
father trap. He stated that In the
forenoon of a day several months
ago, Harris wus sick, and the boy
weni out to bring in somo wood and
when he reuwnfid Hurrls was dead.
The boy stated his nioiwor 0ft Hur
ls' body in the room, and tho iiua
.lay his father made a big fir box
nnd with the aid of his mother and
grandfather the body was taken up
he creek and burled. Tho burial was
supposed to havo been at 5 o'clock
In the afternoon. The boy also ac
cused his mother of killing a Greek
named Peter Paris, a little 4 year old
huby and also a baby five days old.
In his statement ho said:
"Sho hit the baby on the head with
a stick, and mamma had a stick in
her hand and she hit it and It fell
down and never got up and then
she put it in a big pasteboard box
and put it under the bed, and about
three days after they took him away
some place. And then another lit
tle baby, about five days old, and
he died, too, and thoy put him away
over by tho hillside and the grave
was by a big maple tree, and uncle
foil a tree across It and they took
the tree off and cut it up for wood,
mid they took Boiue men up the
creek there and they put them by
that big log."
Coroner White Investigated at the
place designated by tho boy and
found the remains of an Infant, but
luter learned that it was a child of
Mrs. Gay. The buby was dead when
born and a physician's certificate was
produced to verify the statements of
tho parent.
Iu unswer to the question as to
the murder of the Greek, the boy
sold;
"When we (he and his sisters)
were under the table there and
mamma hod the ax in her hand. The
ax was by the wludow and sho took
it and I hoard the man holler and
the blood was coming out of tho side
of his head and they had been quar
rollng there quite a while and they
Htartcd to auarrel about mamma
wanting some money, and he said he
d'.dn't have it, and mamma said he
hud to go down to the office (Ker
ry's) and get it, and he BBid he could
n't get It in the ef.ee and he had to
go to Thompson's siding, and mamma
said he had to o there and get
A nnii m.mmn hit
and mamma nu
the
side ot the head an!
kllkd him and grandpa took him
across tho creek und cut his log off
..nd ho took the shoo and the pants
leg off It and put it In the place where
they cock fish for the chickens, and
they took him up the creek and then
they (mamma, papa and grandpa)
came back und grandpa took the
meat off the bones and threw the
bones into the slough there
wero a few bones left and grandpa
dug a hole and put them bones in it.
That is all they done to him."
The lad described, upon cross ex
amination, every detail connected
with the alleged occurrences, and
three times repeated tho same story.
Finally he broke down and confessed
to Sheriff Stanwood that Mrs. John
son had made up the story and
coached him In It, stating that the
murders had been committed and
that if he didn't tell the story as she
told It to him the sheriff would think
he committed the crimes nnd take
him to Jail.
Every clew given by the boy has
been run down and no foundation for
the story has been discovered. The
murdered Greek, so Sheriff Stanwood
learned, was working In Eugene sev
eral months after the time ho was
supposed to be murdered.
The remarkable phaso of the case
is the testimony of the 10 year old
boy, who geve a clear statement of
all occurrences, fixing times, dates,
locutions, stc, und then never vary
ing from his first statements when
he was cross examined. The case has
Wen the officers no little trouble,
but the sheriff believes he has solved
'.lie various questions and that the
neighborhood will not have any more
similar rows.
The sheriff decided to tunko a
cloanup of the whole affair. Satur
day he went to Tcniuo, where he ar-
tod McFall, bringing him to St.
Helens. M.Paiig Wifo had, a few
days earlier, been located and
brought here. McFall was ciuu,!
with a statutory crime, and before
Judgo Philip his preliminary trial
was held Wednesday. Much evidence
was' Introduced as to how and why
the girl left home. It was shown that
McFall had been "keeping company"
with her for several months, that her
mother remonstrated and tho out
come was that the girl ran away and
met McFall at Kalama, whero they
wore married. McFall swore that he
thought the girl was IS years old,
ind the girl horself claimed bIio was
of that age, but her mother stated
that she was born February 6, 1902.
The Gays wore married in Michigan
!n 1897; tho first child was born In
1898, the second one in 1900 and
'.he third (Mrs. McFall) in 1902. The
girl alleged that sho had been mis
treated and theroforo looked to Mrs.
Johnson (McFall s sister) for pro
tection, but the only Instance she
could name was when her mother
slapped her on the shoulder when the
Irl refused to leave McFall. Much
more evidence, which Is unprintable,
was Introducod. District Attorney
Jooper presented the state's case and
was followed by a Portland lawyer
for the defense. During the speech
of the attorney for the defense Mrs.
Johnson became hystertcr.l and had
to be taken from the court room. M
E. Miller, special prooocutor, summed
up the casa, and the Judge, while er-
prosslng regret on account of the
girl's condition and tho surrounding
circumstances, Btatcd that according
to law he hud no alternative except
to bind
the defendant over to the
grand Jury. Hta bond was fixed at ! L. Morris. The territory assigned
$750, and he Is still in Jail. It is! to the association is all of the torrl
