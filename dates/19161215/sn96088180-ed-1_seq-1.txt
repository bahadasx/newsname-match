"We aaw at once that we would

Statements from the ' east Indi

Nor has there been any diminution

The German advance la slowly

Before long there will be complete

pcdcf&CctnJPcnCrs London, Dec: IS. A steady In
crease In sentiment that the allies In
refusing Germany's peace terms.
should set forth their own terms of
peace. Is manifest here today Not
withstanding the continued Illness of
Premier Lloyd-George, it is known
that the allies, through the foreign
office, already hare begun an in
formal exchange ot vlewa on on
Bethmann-Hollweg's proposals.
There are three views entertained
aa to the coarse which the allies
should adopt In answering the Oer
man note, based on the realization
that the entente powers must care
fully avoid the pitfalls of the Teu
tonic allies. Three plans are:
First A blunt rejection or the
note. The advocates of this course
are convinced that this win be the
only way In which to prevent the sit
uations being maneuvered to advant
age -by Germany. Opponents of the
plan hold, on the other hand, that
It would be a. serious mistake not
to meet the Issues raised by von
Bethmann-Hollweg.
Second That Germany names her
terma Jn the assumption that 'these
terms yet to be made contain official'
ly what really be worth considering
and might be considered without
damage to allied prestige.
Third That the allies do not aak
Germany's terma, but ' detail their
own aentlmenta as to peace; their
terms and conditions.
Suggestions made In the press of
neutral nations snd particularly de
velopment of such an Idea In the
United States has aided in develop
ing sentiment for this third course.
Moreover, it Is seen that the German
government did not expect a wholly
favorable response to the terms:
terefore, England believes the -pur
poses ot Germany's proposals are
To Impress the German public with
the fact that Germany Is fighting for
her existence, and to influence neu
tral opinion.
It la fully expected that Lloyd-
George will be sufficiently recovered
from his Illness on Tuesday to give

by officials of the Twohy Bros, com
pany. The matter is nnder eonsider

ed shortly, said Judge John Twohy,
prealdent of the company, this morn
ing on his return from New York
Although some attractive proposi

the statement was made that It la

"Contracts have been closed with
the Union Pacific system' by the
Twohy Bra. company to build 200
ibox cars, with the probability ot
this number increasing, said Judge
Twohy. . These cars will have steel
undernames and wooden bodies, us
ing fir lumber from local mills. The
contract runs nearly to 1400,000 and
will require the employment Of a
large force of men at the company's
plant on East Sixth street. '
"This car building contract is the
result of negotiations which began
in Portland a few weeks ago while
Joudge Robert S. Lovett, chairman
ot the Union Pacific board, waa mak
ing an inspection ot the system's

said the preference would be given
to the local industry, and this has
probably been done.
