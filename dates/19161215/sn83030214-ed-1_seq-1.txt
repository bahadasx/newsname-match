jTroM 1 I ? ' -
Washington, Dec. i L A greater
obstacle to peace, if a conference Is
held, than any question of territory
or indemnity is seen in the certainty
that limitation of armaments to pre?
vent another holocaust xvill be one of
the first questions on which the eon?
ferreea would clash.
All the European nations have
been clamoring for ? step in that di?
rection, but it became evident to-day
until Germany was further sub
ducd her terms in that respect would
be beyond anything the Allies could
, listen to.
Germany's purpose in a limitation
of armaments, which German spokes
| men hero say that tshe will demand,
is twofold. Russia must be re?
strained from realizing- her full mili?
tary power. England must be robbed
of control of the seas.
Ai a Teutonic diplomat naively
pointed out to-day, a reduction of
standing armies would operate tre?
mendously to Germany's advantage
as against Russia, because, xvhile a
German soldier can be turned out, if
-ary, with one year of training,
the Russian requires at least three
years to approach the same degree
of efficiency. For this reason, he
added, Russia has not been able and
will not be able during the present
witr to put her real man power into
action.
Russia at Diaadxantage
No matter how the ratio of army
strength to population is scaled down,
therefore, Russia will be constantly
*t a disadvantage, and xvill not be
able to realize even her relative mili?
tary strength.
Bal as such a reduction generally
\ throughout Kurope would deprive
Germany of her supremacy over the
present coalition against her, bees ?
ths rule that hold-? gootls for Kus-ia
cannot be applied to France, Great
Bl tain and Italy, Germany adds that
before the disarmament question can
be considered it must apply to sea ;
as xvell as land forces.
This introduces, it is believed,
among diplomats, an tn?uperable ob?
stacle to the disarmament plan, and,
therefore, to the conclusion of any
peace as long as Germany is able to
it? a -ingle clause of the treaty.
Enrlaftd, whose geographical position
aaval supremacy the sine qua ,
'?f national existence, can he
counted SB not to relinquish a ?ingle
?hip while there Is a man left to fight.
(.ermann Se?? little Hop?
PI | Germans themselves, as repre?
sented here, recognize this difficulty,
and privately confess that they see
. hope of pence, no matter what
answer the Allies make to their for
mal invitation to parley. The qu? -
?I land armaments alone, they
? is enough to deadlock the con
? at the start.
'<. an alternatr. e to the reduction
of the standing armies it was sug
gaated in German quarters that a gen?
eral limitation #f ammunition re
- be considered, again enormous?
ly to Germanv'a advantage, because
of the shortness of Germany's interior
lines of communication. But the prac
? lifticulties la the way of enforc?
ing a plan of this aort make serious
?..-ration of it almost out of the

I Tie lack of sincerity and
the object of the German
proposals are evident. The
enemy governments have
need of heroic measures to
complete the gaps in their

ing a sort <>( serfdom in the
guise of compulsory military
-ei vice.
1 he German government,
in order to uplift the hear!?
of its people and pr?paie it
for fresh sacrifices, is striv?
ing to create a favorable *t
mosphere with the following
thesis :
"We are struggling for our
existence; we are proposing
peace; it is refused us.
Iherefore, the responsibility
for the continuation of the
war falls upon our enemies."

He repeated As.?tilth's statement
that there would be no peace until
Germany had made reparation for
her past wrongdoing, and had been
forced to ?i:sure the safety of Kuropo
in time to corr.o. He then pointed out
that Britain was still of the same
frame of mind.
British Financial Situation
Britain's daily war expenditure
was increasing, he said. Her loan?
lo the Allies were growing so largo
that she could not continue her pre?.
ent open-handedne.ss indefinitely.
Nevertheless. Mr. Law remarked,
Britain would never lay herself open
? to the accusation of not using her
[wealth to defeat the enemy, and ho
inguinc that her money would
list until that victory was won.
If the temper of Parliament was
indicative of the f-elmg of the eoun

"Something ha? happened of which
