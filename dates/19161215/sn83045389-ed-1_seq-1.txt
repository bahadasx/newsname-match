No more striking proof of th- vital
ity o'f the country from an industrial
point of view was found than in the
enormous increase in Ihe munition
output during the last %ear.

house to know that it had ifone lartre
lv to < Ire.a t Itrit tin's allies, the do
minions ha\in< I" -n able to llnam-e
their ex pemlit ures. These advances
were just as much war expenditure, he
said, as the amount expended on the
Btitish I roups.
'I'll'- chancellor said it was hoped to
expedite the business of the house
sitting and it might '-e prorogued on
December
Mr I.aw said the house would be
occupied with the appropriation hill
on Monda; nnd Tuesilay. at which
time any business might be discussed.
Iteing- asked by John lledinond as
to the length of the recess after the
prorogua t ion, he replied:
"I hriv- been considering that hut
Che Premier is ill and the doctors will
not allow me to see him, so that I am
not prepared to answer."
I'hlllip Snnwden urged that a full
day tie given for discussion of one
speech before the Uclchstug of Chan
cellor von Ili'thinann-Hollweg. at which
there were erics of "Xo!" from all parts
,.f the house.
Mr I.aw said that no proposals for
peace had yet been received by the
British government from th- central
powers, lie added that the entente al
lies reo'i'red adequate reparation for

"Something iias happened of which

"Naturally Ihe papers arc full of the |

.\ im: her collection is to he made on
Thursday of next week. The results
of the campaign to-day are expected
?o open the eyes of the children to
tin- meat possibilities of saving paper,
and it is expected that the collections
in-xt week will far ex-coed those of to
day. In the city of Washington thi.
was true. The children there raised
fl.'.'afi for the playgrounds, getting
.' imi].ar prices to those fjuoted The
Times-Dispa teh.
There are. nearly 25,000 regular at
tendants of the Richmond schools. t
each boy and girl only brings ten
pounds each day, a total of aOH.OOO
pounds, or 2<mi tons, of waste paper
will be collect ed. This would mean
nearly $1,000 Tor the schools of Rich
mond to have for various Improve
ments. Some of the children are ex
pected to brinir considerably more pa
per than others, while it is naturally
to be expected that some of them wi!
not lie interested enough to aid in any
movement for their own benefit.
There will not be many of that kind
however, as the principals and
teachers have endeavored to impress
upon the children the value of thrift
and economy, as exemplified by the
paper-saving campaign.

Pire oflicials art- highly in accord
with the collection of the waste paper
from residences. The accumulations In
many households is surprising, and it
is a source of constant danger. An
nually. Mayor Ainslie, in his fire-pre*
vention proclamation, calls attention to
the necessity of getting rid of paper
and other waste, which is a hazard
to l>c feared.
Annually there is used in Klchmond
for newspaper purposes alone 30,000,
OuO or more pounds of paper, and prob
ably that much for other purposes. The
larger part of the paper is never again
available for use, being burned or de
stroyed. The clt/ street-cleaning carts
deposit ton after ton at Die incinerator*
or 011 the dumps. If this paper was
systematically saved, it would pay
the wages of several men. Millions of
pounds are lost in other ways.
The paper brought itt by the school
children to-day will then be shipped
back to the factories, where It will he
ground up with wood pulp, and remade
into usable material. Kvory pound ot
paper reclaimed saves that amount of
wood pulp, the scarcity of which is
threatening a famine In paper through
out the country.

same as the published texts. arrlveil hy
eaHle in the early hours of the inorn
inu. ami .ins! as the State I >epn r.tment
was closing for the day. Austria's note
arrived. Secretary Lansing said it was
identical with Germany's. and that
neither contained any change in mean
ing from the semiofficial versions.
It was stated officially that neither
Germany's nor Austrin's note would he
f'lrvvanlod before to-morrow, if indeed
then, and there was no outward indi
cation that the President had made up
his mind what action, if any. he would
take in transmitting: the central powers'
proposals to the entente belligerents.
When, with the announcement of the
German proposals, two days ago, it ap
peared that the entente allies were I11
t dined to reject tin- offer flatly, it ap
peared very doubtful if President Wil
son could tlnd a way to add a word of
mediation in transmitting the note's.
With the apparent moderating of that
first attitude as reflected in the British
newspapers and among the entente al
lied diplomats here, the way seems
easier for the President to express in
some way the hope of the United
States that the proposal for a dlsctls
sion of peace will not be rejected with
i out consideration. In such a step there
Is a likelihood of the United States
being supported by some of the Ktiro
pean neutrals. The minister of one of
! them to-day asked his government to
authorize him to assure the President
. of indorsement in such a move, and It
Is believed others are considering the
same phase of the situation.

I The Spanish ambassador. Mr. Itlano,
and the Swiss minister. Dr. Kilter, both
; conferred to-day with Secretary Lan
? sing. Their governments also are act
ing as intermediaries in transmitting
! the proposals. Whether they discussed
; the prospect of a neutral concert was
I not disclosed.
The change in the attitude of tha
! entente embassies was regarded as the
most interesting development pointing
; to the probable position of the allies.
It was Indicated that it was not im
probable that, after mature delibera
! tion among themselves, the allies would
I make reply inquiring upon what basis
1 a discussion was suggested. Such ac
: tion bv the allies, it was pointed out,
1 would not hind them to a conference.
! The German view of the next prob
able step is that a meeting of repre
sentatives of all belligerents should
be proposed for a general discussion
j of an approach to a basis for peace.
{German officials here repeatedly have
j expressed their conviction that once
, having gone that far, the movement
would result in an actual peace con
ference. The conviction of the allied
diplomats is that Germany's terms, as
| outlined hy the German Chancellor's
j speech. and by the German view
i In Washington, are such that dis
! cussion would not be fruitful of
a conclusion. Hut before approach
ing that stage, they seem to agree that
an inquiry to tire central powers for
more information of their proposal will
be proper, and that it will develop the
ground far the next step.

So far as was known, tire President's
attitude remained undisclosed to any of
his advisers, but the belief grew
stronger that If in forwarding the pro
posals the American government did
not accompany them with more than a
formal ri'Xfce of transmission, it prob
ably in some way later would indicate
its interest in having peace re-estab
lished as soon as possible.
The only official word forthcoming
at the White House was that President
Wilson still was studying the question
closely, and had not readied a deter

expected to take up the question to
