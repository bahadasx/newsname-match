THE MISSION.
The Mission in the Cathdlic church,
attracted a good crowd of people, es
pecially at night, since the beginning,
in spite of the cold weather.
Father Hochard gives in his ser
nions a solid exposition of the funda
mental priuciples and dogmatic and
moral theolofy. He speaks in a plain,
clear way, without any pretentious
Crtory. so that every one can under
stand the full meaning of the argu
m'nts and be convinced by the logic
of them, instead of being astounded by
loud speaking and technical wording.
That unassuming eloquence, although
leaving the speaker unnoticed, makes
a lasting impression in the minds of
the hearers.
The Mission will end Sunday, Dec.
17th. The first Mass, with English
ser5lmon, will begin at 7:30 a. m. The
second '1ass at 10 a. m., with French
t sermon. The closing service will be
at 7:30 p. m. During that service
' another illumination, still more elab
orate than the former one, will add
to the solemnity.
Do not miss the last days of the
e Mission. J. P. Ferret, Rector.

CLAY ROBICHAUX'S HOME hU 'F
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Last Saturday night shortly after
12 o'clock, Mr. andi Mrs. Clay Robi
chaux awoke to find their home in .
flames, and they were compelled to
flee to the street in their night clothes
in order to save their lives. The fire a
originated in the living room of their
nome, a two-room house just cast of '(ei
the Welsh Bakery, and was lapping dlitin
into the room in which they were
sleeping when they awoke. In the` !'
stupor following sudden awakening -'`as
Mr. Robichaux and his wife ran to the ""-i'
street without stopping to secure h P
wraps, and befoer they were able to ' C
realize the acuteness of the situation TIIC
it was too late to return to the burn- tht
ing house, and they were forced to
seek shelter at the home of L. R. Bar
bee. By the time an alarm was given
their home was a mass of burning em- 1
bers, a hopeless ruin, and as Mr.
Robichaux says, he didn't have even,1
a pair of socks.
Mr. Robichaux is unable to explain l'
the origin of the fire. Hee says that,
although his wife retired early, he sat
up by the kitchen stove until about; hl
10:30, reading the latest edition o.'a
the Rice Belt Journal, and that before W. I
retiring he scratched out the few lot
burning embers in the stove, extin- Jei
guished the light-taking a few ih
matches which were in his pants pock- la
et along with him to the bed room
although he left his trousers by the V
stove. After taking such careful pre
'cautions he is very much at a loss
for an explanation of the fire's origin.
Mr. Robichaux is employed at the
MWelsh Grocery and by dint of thrift1'''
and economy he had been enabled to
purchase for himself and wife a mod- n
eat but comfortable home, and its de- have
struction is for him truly a disaster. .
fait1
He carried about $300 insurance on
the ho".se and its contents.
Mr. Robichaux requests the Journal d
I to extend his heartfelt thanks to the `i
s many fr'ends and kind citizens who co'I
contributed liberally far the allevia- 'thin
