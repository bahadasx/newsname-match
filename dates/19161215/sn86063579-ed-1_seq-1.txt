To successfully ruise alfalfa in tins

twice to each cutting.
Mr. Hanson has a pumping plant

which costs uhoul 23 cents nn hour
to operate. . . . . . ..... ,
Mr. Hanson now has about one
hundred pigs, and notwithstanding
the fact that the porkers are selling
at 10 cents on the hoof, there is
more profit in selling milo mnie at

which he puts 110 tons of feed each
