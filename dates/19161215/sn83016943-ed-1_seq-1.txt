Interest in the farm loan act in
this state seems confined to efforts
to corral a bank. Organizations
of associations of farmers, in com
pliance with the law, for securing
loans, has been on rather a small
scale. Quite a contrast is present
ed by the following concerning
North Carolina: "As a result of
this educational campaign in
North Carolina by Nov. 24, there
were 57 national farm roan asso
ciations, and individual applica
tions had been made for $699,325
more.'' Vicksburg Herald.

FROM THE PEOPLE
On account of several errors and omissions
that occurred in printing the article last week
it Is republished,
To the Officials, Members and Friends
of the Methodist Congregation :
Kindly permit me to thank you for
your most effective service, fine co
operation and splendid loyalty during
the conference year just closed. It is
with more than ordinary pleasure that
we retom to you for the year 1917.
By means of this loyalty and co-operation,
God helping us, a splendid year's
work haa been done. We are filled
with pride for the past, of course, as
any people should be proud of a worthy
past, but still these achievements only
teach us how to meet the future and
succeed in all things God would have
us do.
Our aim should be to grow in God's
favor. Our work should be to do God's
will. Our success should be manifest
by the fruits of God's spirit, which
worketh in us day by day teaching us
to be courteous and kind, trusting and
hopeful, long suffering and diligent.
Facing the futuie, we are humbled
before the great responsibility. To
care for the young, to sustain the
weak, to save the sinner is our heaven
imposed duty. He who shirks ia
traitor, both to God and man, so, bj
God's trace, we will be faithful and
fight God's battles to a successful issue.
The report of the year's work is your
report and one of which we all should
feel justly proud; I therefore, render
it to vou as it went to the conference
at Winona:
Additions to the church 71, adults
baptised 17, infants baptized 8, new
subscribers to the Advocate 15.
Raised for church debt, orphanage, in
cidentala. etc $1276.92
Insurance premiums paid 135 00
Womans' work for all societies ous.uu
Paid preacher in charge 1500.00
Paid presiding elder 232.50
Paid conference claims 690.00
Total $4343 42
Again thanking you for your confi
dence, loyalty and co-operation, I am,
Yours in Christ,
E. Nash Bboyles, Pastor.
I have juat seen the newly made rest
room in the court house which has been
so thoughtfully planned and furnished
for the convenience of the ladies.
Whatever money has been spent on it
is certainly a good investment. Natu
rally we men can drop down and rest
anywhere when our business calls us to
the court house, but the women always
desire such privacy as a room of this
kind affords when it becomes necessary
for them to remain long in a public
place of this kind. In the county teach
ing force this year there are probably
thirtj -five or forty lady teachers, who
necessarily must be at the court house
once a month to make their reports and
attend the County Teachers' Associa
tion, and as president of thia associa
tion, I take the liberty and this oppor
tunity to express for them, as well as
the lady public, their appreciation to
Mrs. Tyndall, Mr. Chandler, the Parent-Teacher
Association of the Macon
school, the Board of Supervisors, and
others who were instrumental or aided
in any way in thus providing thia much
needed convenience.
Respectfully yours,
W. B. Jones.
Why the Cool Famine?
Users of coal are being inform
ed by their coal dealers that the
shortage of coal oars makes in im
possible to deliver the coal con
tracted for, and that the dealers
must tae advantage of clauses in
the contracts that where a short
age of cars exists the contract is
not enforcible, but by increasing
the contract price 50 cents or $1 a
ton the coal will be forthcoming.
What kind of a car shortage is it
which prohibits the delivery of
coal at the contract price but per
mits it at from 50 cents to $1 a
ton above the contracted price!
Such a coal shortage may be bona
fide. It may be explained satis
factory to all, but it needs a deal
of explaining. If the railroads
are the guilty parties and not the
coal dealers, this should be made
plain, otherwise a large part of
the public will feel that the coal
dealers are guilty of sharp prac
tice and are conspiring to raise
the price of coal for their own ben
efit. The hard coal dealers might
also explain their extraordinaiy
lack of interest in obtaining
steamers to bring coal by water
from Erie and Buffalo to Chicago.
