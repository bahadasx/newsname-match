Kansas went into the peace move
ment with both feet this afternoon
when more than L',500 men and women
heeretl William Howard Taft, former
lirteulent. in a speech in the auditor
ium and voted for a state-wide organ
ization of the national league to enf
force peace. Organization followed a J
Ui-minute talk uy me lormer pi"
ident in which he outlined policies
and plans of the peace movement..
Nut only will Kansas swing behind
the peace program, but funds will be
pr)idcd for an extension of the work
to other fi Ida. In his speech Mr. Taft
nrued the formation of an interna
tional court to hear and settled isputes
of nations. He urged international
:tgt-'emerii.s for compulsory arbitration
miu i:se forte only where arbitra
tion t;tils or nations refuse to submit
remedial disputes to investigations.
I'rjrt's International Police.
International police methods should
b maintained by nations, Taft urged,
in enforcement of its policies.
Settlement of or incerference with
the war in Kurope were not encourag
ed in the Taft speech. Yet Europe,
he declai ed, will wisely welcome and
receive ;i;iy ;ironi:r, that bars prob
;.biiit:en of 1'turo warfare.
I ):s -listing the European situation,
Tat't .lecltrt'd that Europe would wel
come the aid and leadership of the
I n i ted States in directing a program
for permanent peace.
The first floor of the auditorium
was filled and half of the seats in the
pa Her ies taken when Taft walked on
the stage at :ZQ. A volley of yells
from Washburn r.nd high school stu
dents greeted the former president and
be responded to a noisy greeting with
a bow and the famous smile that won't
wear off.
Mr. Taft was introduced by Walter
Roscoe Stubbs, of La wrer.ee, former
governor. The mere fact that Stubbs
fa led to support Taft in the political
campaign of four years ago did not
lessen his praise of Taft in his advo
cacy of world-wide peace. The intro
duction followed prayer by Father
llayden.
"This meeting involves the great
est problem in the world today." said
Stubbs "and means the stopping by
force if necessary the world war in
2nrp today.
'"While our distinguished visitor
held the greatest office in the gift of
our people." said Stubbs, "I doubt not
that the place he holds today means
more to the future and welfare of the
world thon any office we gave him."
"We don't offer you a panacea or
a cure-all that will end all wars," said
Taft in his opening remarks. "What
we do offer you is a program that
will prevent many wars and make war
less probable."
The former president then discussed
former proposals by peace conferences
and thru treaties.
"We had a big dinner." said Taft.
"and a good dinner makes you anx
ioux to agree. But what was our
horror in August. 1914. to see the
opening of this great conflict."
Something more than dinners and
s-.teeohes must be resorted to in our
effort to work out the world peace
plan, he said. Details of the plan for
realization of ideals of League of
Peace were then discussed by Mr.
Taft.
"If chis program is to be effective,
it must have not only the endorsement
of this nation, but most of the big
nations of Europe," said the speaker.
"Then there is no doubt the smaller
nations will come in out of the rain."
Settlement of disputes by arbitra
tion wa the fundamental principle
advanced by Mr. Taft. He illustrated
hie plan by reference to the Kansas
Colorado controversy concerning the
Arkansas river.
As a result of that suit, you have
a dry state in more ways than one,"
he said. "As between nations your
case might have been a cause of war
but you settled the question thru
and by your courts, just as you should
have done."
Mr. Taft injected keen wit into his
TOPEKA'S
William Howard
discussion of the plan of arbitration
and in illustrating his points. But in
his use of wit he drove home his
arguments for world peace plans.
Take Grievances to Court.
"Under the plan we bring to you,
all nations must submit their disputes
to a court of arbitration," he said.
"This war would have been avoided
and Austria and Servi- submitted their
griefs to a court for compromise.
"Now our plan is that force shall be
used where nations refuse to await
action by arbitration and seek to
throw the world into war. By that T
mean we must have an international
police force that will make certain ob
servance of the agreement. If they
won't permit or give time to settlement
by arbitration, then we shall join to
settle that difference by force if neces
sary. "Why we are all in favor of peace
some of us more than others. But
sane, practical men must take charge
of this thing and there are sane, sensi
ble men who know the value of peace
end will face these matters in a sane
but practical manner. .
Not a Mere Whim.
"This is not a mere theory, or im
aginary whim. It is something that
big, practical men encourage and ad
vance. "It is very wise and just that this
league must have something to say
about the armament the police force,
if you please of all nations. Why
England might now want assurance in
event of peace that some guarantee
may be given that they will not face
such another crisis. And in such de
mands are recognitions of our plan to
enforce peace for all people."
Taft referred to the power in con
gress concerning the right to declare
war. He said there were always un
certainties as to what congress might
do in settlement of international af
fairs. "Why, I have known times
when it was mighty uncertain what
congress would do. And then there
are people who do not believe we
should have armies or use force. All
1 have to say about that is "it ain't so.
Just, if you please, as a parent turns
a child over his knee just to help the
future generation. It is the presence,
not the use, which gets results from
elements of force.
"This is a league to enforce arbi
tration and settle remedial disputes.
We don't believe in war or in force
unless it is necessary. But first we
want to know" that use of such force
is necessary just as it is necessary
for your police force to act."
Mexico a X u i sa nee.
"Mexico is an international nuisance
and we are right up against it," was
the former president's reference to the
Mexican situation. "And there is the
Monroe doctrine like the poor, some
thing we always have with us."
In the next war, Taft declared, there
will be no room for neutrals.
"Then everyone will want in this
league, because there won't be any
place to get under cover if we are
not. Everyone and everything will be
blown up if the science of war in
creases as it has in the last few years.
"This movement means sacrifice. It
means enlistment and awakening of
the interests of the people. Reitera
tion damnable reiteration is neces
sary. Now we want you to enlist.
Kansas is different than I think she
is if she will let the east lead her."
Joked His Way Thru.
William Howard Taft, ex-president
of the United States, joked and guf
fawed his way back into the hearts
of 500 Topeka business men at the
Chamber of Commerce this noon. For
thirty minute?? the big man with the
peculiar guffaw, who laughs at his
own .lokes before anyone knows that
they are, kept the audience in an up
roar as he cracked one joke after an
other, all at his own expense.
"Isn't he a good old sport?"
"You just can't beat him."'
"I never saw anyone with such good
sporting blood in his veins."
These were expressions heard as the
audience crammed its way out of the
Chamber of Commerce and hurried to
the city auditorium where the main
address was delivered by Mr. Taft.
John S. Dean introduced the speaker.
Taft opened his after dinner talk
by referring to Mayor House, who had
announced that he would sit beside
the ex-president and that he was one
of the men in Kansas who had voted
for Taft.
"I wish to say that your mayor in

making this confession has placed
himself in very select company," said
Mr. Taft.
He chided ex-Governor Hock and
ex-Governor Stubbs as men who oc
cupied the same position that he now
holds but braced them up by declar
ing that the triumvirate of ex's "knew
a whole lot more than some people
who know lots." Always before in
forming the audience of his humorous
statements, Taft broke into his famous
smile and guffawed and had them
laughing before they heard the joke.
"I feel grateful to the American
people for what they have done for
me," continued the ex-president. "And
I feel doubly grateful to them for al
lowing me to retire with such undis
guised consent." -..,:"
Complimented Topeka. - .
Taft had heard of the recent re
juvenation of .the Chamber of Com
merce and congratulated the city on
the lare membership, which, he stat
ed, indicated to the world better than
anything else the strength and pros
perity of the city. He further con
gratulated the Chamber of Commerce
for getting away from the dollar be
fore the nose scheme of doing things
and for centering its main activities
in civic affairs and civic betterments.
Taft remembered his visits to To
peka in past years and spoke, in par
ticular, of the time when he dedicated
Memorial hall. Then he launched into
a discussion of the recent election,
! which, by its closeness and accept
i ance of defeat by his own party, ln
I dicated the people's ability to govern
themsel""s. This ability was more
strikingl.v illustrated, he stated, in the
; famous Hayes-Tilden race. He de
scribed the issues in the recent cam
paign hs caloric. Everyone looked
puzzled.
"What does that mean?" some one
shouted.
The question was never answered.
Webster's unabridged states that ca
loric means heat.
Tn ft tnnrhpd li p-htl v on his mission
! of peace which brings him to Topeka.
He admitted that it would be "easy
to suggest corrections on practical
grounds," but urged the adoption of
the principle, with corrections made
later, in order to give the president
the backing of the American people
on a peace propaganda which should
be proposed to the congress of na
tions certain to follow the great war.
Ills Faith in Kansas.
In closing he expressed his faith in
Kansas
j "With $2 wheat I should think you
all would be in a philosophic frame of
t mind," wefe his parting words.
1 To get Taft and his party to Kan
sas in time, the Missouri Pacific ran a
special train out of St. Louis last night,
j The train left St. Louis at 12:40 o'clock
j and arrived in Kansas City at 7:40
' o'clock, near a record breaking time.
A special car was run from Kansas
City to Topeka today and Superin
tendent Brooks and Judge Merriam
of the Missouri Pacific, accompanied
the Taft party. Ex-Governors Stubbs
and Hoch joined the party at Law
rence. Other members of the party
were: Charles C. Michener, director
of field work for the League to En
force Peace. Wendall W. Mischler, sec
retary to Mr. Taft. George Sherwood
Eddy of Leavenworth, and W. R.
Boyd, jr., district secretary. Orchestra
music was enjoyed during the noon
day lunch.
Eddy's Speech.
George Sherwood Eddy, with the
Taft party, told Kansans his after
noon of the horrors of the European
war and pleaded for united effort in
bringing about world peace. Eddy is
a former Kansan. He formerly lived
in Leavenworth.
In his appeal in Topeka this after
noon, Eddy did not urge an effort to
bring the European war to a close.
In fact, he declared that the work of
the peace league was in the future in
cementimr the nations and settlement
i of international disputes by arbitra-
tion.
j "I have been thru Russia, Turkey,
I Bulgaria, Servia, Greece. Egypt,
! France, Italy and was on tours with
! the British army at its base camps.
as well as on a trip thru Germany
earlier in the war," said Eddy. "I
went there hot with academic interest.
I came back burning with the convic
tion that America has the responsibil
ity of laying the foundation for lasting
peace.

DRASTIC RAILROAD
RULES TO SOLVE f
CARJHORTAGE
Become Effectiye Thruout En
tire Nation Today.
ExpenslTe to Shipper to let
Car Stands Loaded.
PENALIZE RAILROADS ALSO
Some Roads Hold 5,000 to 10,
000 Foreign Cars.
Will Cost Shippers as High as
$5 a Day Storage.
Washington. Dec. 15. Drastic reg-J
ulations adopted by the railroads went,
into effect today, with the approval of
the interstate commerce commission
as emergency measures to relieve the
shortage of freight cars which for,
months has been a brake on the coun
try's commerce and affected the high
cost of living.
The remedy is the railroads own,
proposed by the car service commis
sion of the American Railway associa
tion and formally approved by the
federal commission. The first regula
tion provides that a consignee may
have the usual two days to unload a
car and that thereafter demurrage
shall be charged at the rate of $1 for
the first day, $2 for the second. $3
for the third and $5 for the fourth
and each succeeding day. Heretofore
the charge has been uniformly $1 a.
day, and many consignees, notably au
tomobile concerns and' coal dealers,
are declared to have been glaji to per
mit cars to stand for long periods be
cause the penalty was so small that it
compared favorably with warehouse
charges.
Detroit Held 25,000 Cars.
Another order increases the daily
rental paid by railroads to each other
for cars from 45 to 75 cents per car.
Some eastern roads are said to have
from 5.000 to 10,000 foreign cars of
a single type. The order is expected
to make serious difficulties for some
small roads which do not have suffi
cient equipment of their own.
The rise in the price of coal
is attributed almost wholly to the car
shortage aided by the alleged activi

stuffs; the same situation iB-.aid tdtt
have applied, only it has been less?
acute. In railroad yards of the middle
west the relief of the congestion under
these and related orders are said to
have been marked. Thus at Detroit
within a month the number of loaded
cars in the railroad yards awaiting un
loading is said to have fallen from
25,000 to 15.000.'
Further consideration of the prob
lems presented by the shortage of cars
is the subject of a conference here to
day of officials of eastern roads. A
meeting of some of the chief shippers
of the country will be held here next
week.
CAPPER FOR PEACE
Governor Speaks Before Con
ference of Governors.
"Better Fight It Out Than Have
an Armed Truce."
Washington, Dec. 15. Speaking be
fore the conference of governors.
Governor Capper of Kansas today de
clared that in the desire for world
peace it were Detter that warring na
tions of Europe continue hostilities
uninterrupted than that they resort to
armed truce and nurse their animosi
ties. Governor Capper spoke today
concerning "Our Duty and Responsi
bility at the Close of the World War."
In a forty-minute speech he urged
prompt action by the United States in
forming a permanent international
peace league at the conclusion of
European hostilities.
Governor Capper talked peace at
the annual gatherings of United States
governors this afternoon, while Wil
liam Howard Taft. former president,
urged adoption of the program of the
League to Enforce Peace in a speech
in Topeka, the Kansas governor's
home town. Action by the United
States looking to world-wide peace
would be welcomed by the belligerent
nations, said Governor Capper, who
declared this country is the logical na
tion to point tne way to future set
tlements of disputes thru arbitration.
The world, tho, must safeguard
against make-believe peace pacts in
the settlement of the war in Europe,
Governor Capper said.
'Better that this war with all its
unspeakable frightfulness and suffer
ing should continue for years." sail
the governor, "than that it should end
with an inconciusive peace in an
armed truce with the contending na
tions nursing their old animosities and
ready to resume hostilities upon the
first provocation or excuse."

Washington. Dec. 15. Attorney
General Gregory today turned over to I
Assistant Attorney General load, gov
ernment "trust buster," serious
charges preferred by H. B. Varner,
North Carolina, publisher, tending to j
show "an understanding" between cer-
tain manufacturers of newsprint paper ;
to maintain "ruinous prices." j
Varner's action in going right to i
headquarters with his charges follow-
ed his appearance before the- federal j
trade commission which has been in-
vestigating the alleged "paper trust." J
Varner told the attorney general in- i
dividual publishers are afraid to testify j
against the paper manufacturers for i
fear of having their paper supply sum
marily cut off. He said after agitat
ing the question in the house he found
he- was unable to obtain print paper
except at utterly prohibitive prices.
Small Papers Boar Burden.
"Our entire output contracted for,"
was the invariable answer, he said. -
Many small papers, particularly in
the south, Varner said, are on the
verge of positive bankruptcy from the
present price of paper, when, indeed
it is possible to get it at all.
Manufacturers in an effort to con
ciliate the publishers urged they in
crease subscription prices and adver
tising rates, throwing the burden on
the public, said Varner.
Inasmuch as most of the big metro
politan daily papers overate their jywn
paper mills, it is mostly the rural pa
pers that are "feeling the pinch" he
pointed out.
After filing his charges with the at
torney general, Varner, it was learned
today, discussed possible remedial leg
islation with Senator Simmon. The
latter stated he believes that "unless
thedepartment of justice finds some
way to bust the news print paper
trust,-the. freedom of the press is in
danger.
Canada Makers in Trust.
"That there is a combination of pa
per manufacturers is evident in infor
mation now before the department,"
said Simmons. .
"I believe it is an international trust.
"Without the aid of Canadian manu
facturers I do not think the paper
manufacturers of the United States
could hold up the price of print paper.
"If the department of justice, the
attorney general and the federal trade
commission, after exhausting their
powers, find themselves unable to
bust this combination, let them call
upon congress for an increase in pow
er and I am sure it will be granted."
Federal Control of Distribution.
New York, Dec. 15. Tackling the
acute situation in the print paper
market, newspaper publishers today
proposed to make the federal trade
commission the "middleman" to super
vise distribution of print paper at
equitable prices. They presented their
plan to the Paper Manufacturers of
North America in session here. The
federal trade commission also met
here and awaited decision of the
manufacturers, recommending that no
new paper contracts be signed mean
while, -pending agreement by the three
bodies now at work to solve the paper
problem.
Ernest G. Smith of the Wilkesbarre
Times-Leader and E. H. Tomlinson of
the Norristown (Pa.) Record, dele
gates from the Affiliated Publishers'
association, now in session at Wash
ington, presented the publishers' plan
at the Waldorf meeting today.
Demand Stable Prices.
They declare prices now range from
2 cents a pound for metropolitan pa
pers with good shipping facilities i
from mills to 7 cents for small pub-
Ushers in far districts. They propose
an investigation of cost of production j
and present prices and the establish- i
ment of a flat price by the federal
trade commission, to which will be
added freight charges. Available ton
nage of paper would then be distrib
uted fairly in the district adjacent to
the mills, eliminating long freight
hauls and insuring to publishers cer
tainty regarding the price they would
have to pay. At present, they de
clared, prices fluctuate widely and
publishers are forced to pick up a
carload here and two carloads there
at whatever price the manufacturer
or dealer is able to demand.
TO EDITORS' RESCUE
Representative Campbell's Bill Would
Break Grip of Paper Trust.
Washington, Dec. 15. A bill aimed
at protection of publishers of all small
newspapers, which it is charged, are
now at the mercy of a "combination"
of powerful news print paper manu
facturers, was introduced in the house
today by Representative Campbell of
Kansas.
Government to Economize In Paper
The senate today adopted a resolu
tion by Senator Kenyon of Iowa, di
recting the committee' on printing, in
view of the scarcity and increasing
cost of print paper, to investigate the
subject and to recommend that gov
ernment publication might be tempo
rarily suspended and that economies
might be practiced in the various gov
ernment departments in the interest of
conservation of paper.

PRESIDENT WILSON PUZZLED
Has Crucial Moment Arrived
for Diplomatic Action!
Cabinet May Inform Public
What U. S. Intends to Do.
Washington, Dec. 15. The whole
subject of peace and the part America
can play if any, will undoubtedly he
threshed out in this afternoon's cabi
net session.
Confidential information from Sec
retary Grew, of the American Berlin
proposals, is scheduled for 'pro.fci.ta
tion to the members along with con
sideration of past Official reports and
recent unofficial versions of foreign
e.VHude toward peace.
The state department was reliably
understood to be collecting thJs fore
norn all its past information bearing
on the subject of peace. This, taken
with news messages, indicated a sen
timent on the allies part against yield
ing up the struggle to diplomacy at
this moment.
Uncle Sam Still Uncertain.
Meantime German official hints
here pointed to a willingness to talk
at least a partial disarmament and
likewise a willingness for introduc
tion of a world guaranty of peace.
The administration now feels that
there may be instructive discussion of
the peace proposals among the allies,
but has no reason to believe that
the present proposals themselves will
at once point the way to peace. Petro-
grad s semi-ornciai statement tnat
Germany is deluding her own people
and trying to cast the responsibility
for continuance of the war elsewhere
is regarded as a. general allied view
point. In these circumstances President
Wilson and his advisers are admittedly
still puzzled to know just what atti
tude and what action, if any, to take.
It was expected that the cabinet session-
would serve to clear the official
atmosphere and that it might be pro
ductive of some definite information
to the public as to what this govern
ment proposes to do.

OPINION GROWS
FOR ALLIES TO
PUBLISH TERMS
Entente Nations Open Ex
change of Views on Peace.
Three Views as to Course
Allies Can Take.
SUSPICIOUS JF A PITFALL
U. S. Sentiment Urges Allies to
State Demands.
Opportunity Ripe for An
nouncement of War Aims.
London, Dec. 15. A steady increase
in sentiment that the allies in refusing
German peace plans set forth their
own terms of peace, was manifest here
today. Notwithstanding the continued
illness of Premier Lloyd-George, it is
known that the allies, thru the foreign
office, have already begun an informal
exchange of views on von Bethmann
Hollweg's proposals.
r,ei-o nr thrpp views entertained
as to the course which the allies should
adopt in answering the German note,
based on the realization that the en
tente powers must carefully avoid the
pitfalls of the Teutonic nations. Three
plans are:
Blunt Rejection Advocated.
First A blunt rejection of the
note. The advocates of this course
are convinced that this will be the
only way in which to prevent the
situations being maneuvered to ad
vantage by Germany. Opponents of
the plan hold, on the other hand,
that it would be a serious mistake
not to meet the issues raised by von
Bethmann-Hollweg.
Second That Germany name her
terms on the assumption that these
terms yet to be made known offi
cially, may really be worth consid
ering, and might be considered
without damage to allied prestige.
Third That the allies do not ask
Germany's terms, but detail their
own sentiments as to peace; their
terms and conditions.
V. S. Sentiment Has Influence.
Suggesions made in the press of neu
tral nations and particularly develop
ment of such an ideal in the United
States, has aided in developing senti
ment for this third course. Moreover,
it is seen by news from Germany that,
the government did not expect a fav
orable response to its proffer; there
fore England regards the main pur
pose of von Bethmann-Hollweg's pro
posals as manifestly two-fold, to im
press neutrals and the German public.
Advocates of trie policy of the al
lies listing their terms, argue that in
such a situation as presented now. the
entente have a splendid opportunity
