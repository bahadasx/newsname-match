It is estimated the trips can be made
in 'frpm six? t6 fourteen hours, depend
ing dpon the wind, and that the aver
age running time for the 720vmlles (air

cities would be eight hours.
Certain American promoters have
proposed definite plans for tne main

out that "the flights of Ruth Law 'ana

help along the route, whereas we would
provide everything that can be thought
of."
Leaving New York at. du£k, the air

"KSI3TANCE POWER
NOT YET BROKEN
Note Implies That Unless Offer Fur
nishes Basis For Peace Germany
Will Fight to End Even If Army Is
•Exterminated—Note Declares Cen
tral Powers Are Not Seeking An
nihilation of Enomies.
Further developments regarding
the peace proposals are awaiting
the consultations and decision of
the entente governments as to the
official actiort to be taken. Prob
ably nothing definite may be ex
pected^before next we^k Sorrie of
the sections of the official German
note are being studied With in
terest by diplomats, especially the
admission that the central powers
have reached the height of their
aggressive abilities while claiming
that their strength of resistance is
not yet broken. Another Signifi
cant point In the official note is the
hope that the proposals will^erv^
as a "basis" for peace. This is in
terpreted- in* some quarters" that
Germany and Austria-Hungary are
ready to concede more than they
apparently offer.
Washington, Dec. 15.—An unofficial
translation of ^he German" note' pro-*
posing peace negotiations, made here
from the official French text obtained
from a diplomatic source, shows that
while accurate in substance the pre
vious published version had the__docu
ments out of their proper order.? The
translation follows:
"The most terrible war which history
has known has been ravaging a large
part of thtfworid Cor two years and a
half. This calamity, which the Bonds
of thousands of years, of a common
civilization have not been able to pre
vent, is Injuring humanity in Its most
precious heritage. It ^threatens to
plunge into ruins- the mjtrat progress
which flwas the pride, of^iirope at the
dawn, of the, twentiethycentjiry.
"In*this struggle Gefmftny and- her,
allies—Austrla-Hangary, Bulgaria and
Turkey—have given proof of their un
conquerable strength by achieving im
portant successes over adversaries su
perior in number and in war materials.
The, last diversion in the Balkans
has been speedily and victoriously
thw£rted.v Recent events haVe demon
strated that the prolongation? of the
war would*- not be able to break their
power of resistance, On the other -hand,
the general situation justifies them
from hoping for further successes.
Not Seeking to Annihilate.
"It was to defend their existence and
the freedom of their national develop
ment that the four Allied powers were
forced to take up arms. The achieve
ments of their armies have not altered
this purpose. Not for a single instance
have they departed from the convic
tion that respect for the rights of «lth
er nations Is in no way incompatible
with their own legitimate interests.
.They do nqt seek to shatter or annu
late their adversaries.
"Conscious of their military and
economic power, and ready if neces
sary- to continue to the very epd the
struggle yhich was forced upon them,
but inspired at the same time 'with a
desire to Stop the flow, of blood and to
put an end to the horrors of w&T, the
four, allied- powers propose to ehter
forthwith into negotiations for pe$oe.
They are convinced tl}at the prqposals
which they will submit and* which ali»
to insure' the existence of the honor
and the development of their peoples
will be appropriate to serve air a basis
for the re-establishment of a perma
nent peace.
"If despite of this offer of peace and
reconciliation the struggle should go
on, the fouj? allied powers arfe deter
mined to continue "It to the end, dis
claiming solemnly' Before history and
humanity their responsibility therefor.".

Russian' Semi-Offioial Statement Hos
to Teutonic Move.
Petrograd, vla London, Dec.15.—The
foiiowjisg semi-offiirial i"^
/gardlng the Russian attitude on the
peace proposals has been issued by the
Petro$rad'newa agency:
"The new appeal of our enemigs is
not their first atleiript lo throw, upon
the entente powers the responsibility
for the war they let loose. In order to
obtain the support of the Gernoi&n peor
pies, who are tlred of the war, t|ie Ber
lin government many times has 'had
recourse to fallacious wqrds of peace,
and has frequently, in orter to ani
mate its troops, offered prospects olan
early peace. It promised peace when
Warsaw was taken, when Serbia vas
conquered, .'forgeting that such. prom
ises unfilled would, create profound,dls''
.trust."'.
Try "More'Serious pl^n." ..
Citing further efforts by Geri^any to
"sow. discord "among the allies," the
statement continue^:
5"'
"In view of the fact,- however that
.,
-i-
the allies wl}h strong unanimity re
jected al%these attempts, our enomies
had to think of a more serlouB plan.
They today are making, in spite of
their confidence in their military ahd*
economic power, an appeal to the
United States, Spain and Switzerland,
announclng^their anxiety to enter into
negotiations for peace.
"The object pursued by Germany,
however, Is clear. She speaks of re
spect for th«t $ffhts Qt' other nations,
but at the s«mp' time she has already
iiTtroduced into Belgium, Serbia, Monte
negro and Poland a regime of terror
and violences As for the future, Ger
many has. proolaimed an illusory inde
pendence for Poland she proposes to
divide Serbia between Bulgaria and
Austria, economically to subjugate Bel
gium and cede- to Bulgaria part of Rou
manian territory.
No Grounds For Parleys.
... "feverywhere* the idea of hege
mony of Germany predominates. The
latest speeches of Von Bethmann-Holl
weg show the true aspirations of the
German governmept. But today, when
the entente powers have proclaimed
their un»hakab|j0 determination to con
tinue the war tt) a successful end and
to prevent GeiMany from establishing
her hegemony, no favorable ground
exists for feace^ negotiations.
"Our enemies' knew of the speeches
of Lloyd-George, Brland and Boselli,
and the statement of Trepoff they
were therefore- assured that their pro
posal would be Unacceptable. It Is so.
not because th«JKentente powers the
friends of peac»—are not inclined thAt
way, but because the peace offered by
Germany is a snare for public opinion,
yhat is why the enemy governments
carefully avoid mentioning the condi
tions of peace.
firm determination of the en
tente powers to continue the war to a
final triumph'can be weakened by no
illusory proposals of the enemy."

STEP TOWARDS DRY NATION.
House Committee Takes Favorable
Stand on Proposed Amendment.
Washington,' Dec. 16.V-Nation-wide
prohibition took a long stride toward
congressional consideration when the
house^udiCiary committee unexpected
ly voted to recommend adoption of the
resolution to submit a constitutlopal
amendment forbidding the manufacture
ahd sale of liquor for beverage pur
poses In the United States.
N^lven the most enthusiastic cham
pions of the amendment had not ex
pected favorable action so soon from
the committee, which at the last session
voted to postpone its consideration In
definitely.
Mow far the resolution_will progress
thya the various legislative stages of
congress at this session is problemati
cal, but administration leaders doubt
that it will-reaoh .the senate in time for
action at this session.
Prohibition advocates are jubilant
over the action of th,e committee, how
ever, and predict ultimate adoption ot
the resolution and' reference of the
amendment t» the legislatures of the
various states at a much earlier date
than they heretofore fhad hoped for. A
two-thirds majority in both houses Is
required.
Coincident with the committee's ac
tion on the amendment the prohibition
Issue was brought directly to the at
tention of the senate, when the Shep
pard bill to prohibit the manufacture
and sal^ of liquor"in the District of
Columbia became the unfinished busl
ncss to be Iccpt fcefers th? s^n^tc until
disposed of.*
As an amendment to this bill Senator
Underwood has proposed a referendum
to the male voters of the district. Sen
ator Kern, of Indiana, has added a
proposal that women also should par
ticipate in the referendum.
Sentiment in the senate for and
against the referendum appears to be
closely divided, with. a vote on the
subject expected within a day or two.
Discussion of the Sheppard bill af
forded opportunity for comment on the
proposed amentynent, several senators,
among them Sheppard, Vardaman and
Owen, predicting triumph for the
cause of nation-wide prohibition In the
near future.

Premier's Speech in House of Com

bers Urge Cautious Movement in
Order to Prevent Creation of Fric
tion—Formal Notes to Go Forward.
Washington, Dec. 15.—President Wil
son probably will not finally determine
on any formal steps In connection with
the pe^ce proposals of the central
powers until after David Lloyd-George,
the British prime minister, has spoken
in the house of commons on Tuesday.
Secretary Lansing early today held
his first conference with the president
since the peace proposals were made
public. It is said the formal notes of
Germany and Austria might go for
ward before night and that it is prob
able the president would take no Inde
pendent action until after Premier
Lloyd-George has spoken in the house
of commons.
To Move Cautiously.
In the meantime thru the American
diplomatic representatives in the capi
tals of the erttente powers the Ameri
can government will keep in close
touch with the situation.
It is known to be the view "of most of
the cabinet members that tlje Ameri
can government should move cautious
ly and do nothing to imperil its influ
ence for pea£e.
President Wilson is known fo attsioh
importance to the possibility of estab
lishing an association of nations to
maintain peace. He outlined the po
sition he would take in a peace move
ment in a speech here last May. At
that time the president said:
"If It should ever be our privilege to
suggest or Initiate the movement for
peace among the nations now at war.
I am sure that the people of the United
States would wish their government to
move along these lines:
/'First, such a settlement with regard
to their own immediate interests as the
belligerents may agree upon. We have
nothing, material of any kind to ask for
ourselves Our interest is only ii^peaoe
and.Up future guacikhte«)p,
"Second,' a .universal association of
nations to maintain the- inviolate -se
curity of the highways of the seas for
the common and unhindered use of all
the. nations of the" world, and to pre
vent any war contrary to treaty cov
enants, a virtual guarantee of territory
integrity ahd of political independ
ence."
The president said the American
people believe every people have the
right to choose the sovereignty under
flitch, they shall live.
GUARD TRAGEDY. UNCONFIRMED.
Published Reports of Private Brady's
Death Apparently Unfounded.
Des Moines, Dec. 13.—Confirmation
was lacking here today of the pub
lished reports that Private William
Brady, of Muscatine, Battery C., First
artillery Iowa National Guard, had
been killed while en route from
Brownsville, Tex., to Davenport .Iowa
on a troop train.
Investigation at -Muscatine, where
the item is said to jiave originated, de
veloped no basis of fact for the story.
The Associated E^ess correspondent
at Brownsville, Tex., said Brady left
there early today on a troop train and
that no report of an accident had been
recelyed there. The office of the
adjutant general here had not been ad
vised of the accident, and General
Logan advised his department from
Davenport that he had no information
regarding the reported death.
Major Whitley, commander of the
First'artlllery, is in Wausau, Wis., on
a-furlough, and could not be reached.
Statements by persons who investi
gated the reported death at Muscatine
said that in their opinion the story was
started' by idle gossip.
According to published accounts,
Brady was decapitated by -a bridge
girder when he thrust his head thru a
car window.

Washington. Dec. 15.—Drastic regu
lations adopted by the railroads went
into effect today with the approval of
the interstate commerce commission of
.emergency measures to relieve the
shortage of freight cars, which for
months has affected the high cost of
living. The remedy is the railroads'
own proposed by the car service com
mission of the American Railway As
sociation and formally approved by
the federal commission.
The first regulation provldos that
consignee may ha^p the usual two
days to unloud a car and that there
after demurrage shall be charged at
the rate of fl for the first day, $2 for
the second, $3 for the third and 5 for
the fourth and each succeeding day.
Heretofore the cimrgo has bccii, uni
formly $1 a day a'nd many consignees,
nojably automobile firms and coal
dealers, are declared to have been glad
to permit shipment^ to stand fdr long
periods because the penalty was so
small that it compared favorably with
warehouse charges.
Shortage Cause of Coal Rise.
The rise in the price of coal Is at
tributed almost wholly to the car
shortage, aided by activity of specu
lators. While the east was paying
panic prices for coal the mines of the
middle west and to less degree of the
anthracite section were working with
reduced forces or on part time, in
many Instances,.because there was not
a supply of cars to handle ttfe output.
An order for the return of coal cars to
their owners, loaded or empty, was is
sued several weeks ago by the car ser
vice commission to meet this condi
tion.
In respect to foodstuffs, the same sit
uation is said to ha*e •nnlled. alfho it

of the commission, which provide that
receiving roads shall return box cars
and refrigerating cars, to owning llnps,
are said to be showing effect now.
