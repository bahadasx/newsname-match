(.EiniAN PEACE TALK
ABSORBS ATTENTION
Berlin Dispatches Tell of Serions
Struggle at Katerina?Heavy FigHi
ing in Progress North of Monastir
-^Hliaiiiaiis in Battle.
The announcement by tne Teutonic
C allies of their readiness to discus*
peace with the entente allies continues
the absorbing feature in the war
pews. As yet, however, no announce
ment has been vouchsafed as to the
"basis on which they desire to'attempt
to bring an end to the war. Neither
has there come from any of the en
tente countries any official announce
ment as to the attitude they pur
*pose to take with regard to the pro
posal. Meantime the conquest of Rou
mania by the Teutonic allies continue^.
All along the front the Roumanians
9-ra 4r? rotrpot -rmrf-hpastward. and the
Ninth German army is nearing the im
portant railroad junction town of
Buzea. In the Carpathian and along
the Moldavian frontier, the Russian*
and Germans still are at grips witn
the Russians the aggressors at most
points. There is little or no change
in the situation in these regions, now*
From Greece, by way of. Berlin,
vomes the announcement that Green
regulars have clashed with French
* troops at Katerina, some 03 miles
southwest of Saloniki, and that, after
a eharp fight, the reeks have taken
the town. There has been much con
fusion recently as to operations in this
vicinity, where Gen. Sarrail is sup
nnspd to have exercised the authority
of the entente powers to suppress
Greek demonstrations, and this is the
first definite news of operations. Ota
er dispatches from entente sources iu
.dicate that the situation is less criti
cal than might be gathered from Ben
lin's announcement. They say thai
-the Greeks are still optimistic as to the
chances for a settlement of differences
vithout a break.
Heavy artillery fighting is in prog
ress . north of Monastir. Otherwise
calm prevails. A new feature in the
Balkan situation is a report from So
fia that 6,000 .Albanians have defeated
a force of Italians near Pasnesnia,
ispirus, me itanaus ucciug.
On the front in France and Bel
gium and in the Russian and Austro
Italian theatres there is little activity
aside from artillery duels.
GERMANY OFFERS PEACE
WITHOUT NAMING TERMS
German Empire, Ready for Fighting
and Ready for Peace, Declines B?
sponsibility If Offer Falls Upon
Deaf Ears in Entente Countries,
Declares Imperial Chancellor iu
Historic Address.
Berlin, Dec. 12.?Germany today
offered peaceXto the allies.
The imperial chancellor. Dr. von
Bethmann-Hollweg, speaking for the
German empire and its allies. Au&
tria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey,
announced in the reichstag that Ge
bad given to the diplomatic represen
tatives of Spain, the United States ana
Switzerland, a joint note addressed to
Germany's enemies, proposing to then,
to enter into peace negotiations.
The chancellor did not announce
the terms upon which Germany and
her allies will make peace. Nor are
they contained in the note he handed
to the three neutral diplomats for
transmission to the entente powers.
The only reference he made to them
was that they had the object of
"guaranteeing tke existence, honor
and liberty of evolution" for nations
extending the offer and "are according
to their firm belief an appropriate
*V.a />f orof
UA015 iUl LUC COta UHOUIUVII l VI. v ? V4
lasting peace."
This reference is contained in the
note addressed to the allies. The re
presentatives of Spain, the United
States and Switzerland were selected
for the transmission, because thesy
countries represent the entente inter
ests in Germany and the countries or
her allies.
Simultaneously with the issuance of
the note to the allies Germany sent
a communication to Pope Benedicr,
through German minister to the vat
"^ican. Dr. Otto von Muehlberg, noti
fying the pontiff of Germany's peac*
move, eulogizing the Holy Father for
his efforts in behalf of peace during
the last two years and expressing the
confidence that Germany's initiative
""will find a friendly welcome on the
part of His Holiness and that the worK
of peace can count upon the preciou*
support of the Holy See."

on by the Democratic candidates for

William Winard Howard, of New

I want to writ,? one more piece be

tiying to-say something, whether ii
is worth much or not I do not knotv
and if you do not think much of it,
why just pass it oyer and take thh
good intention for the deed. I said

make a suggestion to all the boys and j
girls and the old boys and the ola ' ?
girls as well. I was just reading the ; t
other day a little poem by Joaquin ?
Miller, and 1 want to pass it on to: ^
you at this time of the year and 1 j
want you to think about it and act on i
it. There are many of the young boy3
and young Sirls who still h^ve the'
srea't blessing of having their mother 1 ]
with them. Somr> have not that great '
blessing and privilege and who feei *
now that they would give almost any- !
thing if they just could bring mother ! 1
back for one more Christmas at the \
old home. Of course, for those who I 4
have no mother I cannot speak at ^
now, but I do want to say a word
to those who have the great privilege,1
to remember mother at this time. It' '
you are away from home she is think- j
mg about you just as much and jusr t
as often as if you were still at the 1
home, and the word I want to say is, i
don't forget mother at this Christmas (
time. Send her some token r,ncl em- j
blem of love and affection and write
her a sweet little note and tell her'
how much you love her and how you
appreciate her.

London, Dec. 33.?The indication;,

It was pointed out in well informed
[uartors today that while each one oi

ibly would require two or thre*v

The disposition this morning was to
vithliold comment, in as much as the
ictual proposals had not been receiv
ed or, so far as was known, transmil
ed to the British government or other
nembers of the entente. It was e.\
)ected this first formality would be
iccomplished quickly and that there
s-ould be disclosed what thus far haa
:een largely a matter of conjecture
whether any specific tTms have been
>ut forward by the Teutonic -allies.
One of the factors which, according
o an opinion expressed nere, militates
tgainst acceptance is that the op.'nin^
)f negotiations would necessarily Do
ollowed by an armistice.
No specific suggestion of an armis>
ice is made, so far as is indicated Dy
lie unofficial reports received, bui
t is said the precedent of 1866 in the
lustro-German peace negotiations ana
>f 1870 in the FrancotGerman negot
iations establishes that an armistice
md suspension of ill military activity
ollow the opening of negotiations.
The view expressed here is that
lormsnv u-rmlri liavp the mnsf to ?aiii
rom an armistice owing to recent
osses on various fighting fronts ana
iconomic stringencies within Teutonic
erritory. For that reason the prots
>ects of an armistice is not regarded
vith favor in London. The sugges
ion is advanced that one of the chiet
notives prompting the proposal was
o gain Time.
Concerning unofficial reports, tha.
>ne of the Tuetonic proposals is a
eturn to the status quo before tne
var. except as to creation of Polish
md Lithuanian kingdoms, it is said
lere that this apparently is impoo- j
;ible from the British viewpoint, as |
t would not provide any compensa-'
ion to Belgium, whose defence h??~
tlways been referrr-d to as one ot
he principal motives of Great Brit
lin in entering tne conflict.
In the same circles Russia's refu
sal also is expected of any settlement
which would leave parts of ervla
svhich would leave parts of Servia

Russia's entry into the war.
HIE GENEROSITY OF

f one knows the facts it is generally
ound that th? y are the most liberal

The Armour and Company of Chi- J

I MiTJKI) STATES IS SOW FKEE
TO MAKE MEDIATION EFFORTS
'Washington, Dec. 12.?Germany's
proposal for peace is regarded here as
having broken the chains which for
months have restrained the United
States as well as other neutrals from
n;akins- offers of mediation.
Now that one set of belligerents has
signinea us willingness to discuss
peace terms?a condition often reiter
aied as necessary to any action by
President Wilson?there are indica
tions that wnen the United States, act
ing as intermediary, transmits tn?
German proposal it may accompany
iis acaon by seme steps, necessarily
tieiicate, to throw tee influence of the
I'nited States into the balance for
at least a consideration, however pre
liminary, of the t-.-rnis on which a
lasting peace much be brcruglit to the
world. Some ranking' officials of the
American Government believe a lea
gue of nations, such as President Wil
son has suggested, must be the out
come, ?and it could not be perfected
without the participation of the Unit
ed States.
iint Vote Tndftv.
;Whether the United States will
transmit the German proposal without
any comment whatever or accompany
it with some formal or informal ex
pression w;U not be finally decided
until the iu a delivered to American
Charge Crew in Berlin reaches Presi
dent Wilson's hands, probably tomor
row.
There were indications tonight thai
President Wilson might find some
way to express the solemn and earn
est wish of the United States for a
,careful consideration of the sugges
tion of peace, even before the Enten
te governments have made known their
attitude toward the German proposal.
This, however, it was pointed out,
necessarily wouia dc uuue m suui *
delicate and ultracoufidential was
vay that it never would be publicly
.known should the Allies decline the
offer. This course was said to be
absolutely' necessary so as to leave
the United Slates fre- and unembar
rassed to act when an acceptable
peace offer came.
Regardless of whether President
Wilson decides to accompany the Ger
man proposal with any word, it wp
said tonight he unquestionably wouM
take steps to learn the attitude of the
Entente Allies toward the peace move
and possibly might again send to En
rr>ne his persona1 friend and advisor.
