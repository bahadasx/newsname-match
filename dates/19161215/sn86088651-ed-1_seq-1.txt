Austin, Texas, Dec. 15. According
to Peter Radford, present state ware
house manager and past president of
the State Farmers' Union, the Nation
al Farmers' Union has taken no ac
tion relative to the regulation of the
price of cotton for next season. That
organization, however, has appointed
a committee to study the cotton situ
ation and this committee will decide
what is best to be done In the matter.
Mr. Radford Is of the opinion that
there will be no more cheap cotton
and that next year's crop will yled
between 15 and 20 cents a pound. He
finds the farmers In the cotton belt of
Texas have made plenty money this
season, but despite this fact they pro
pose to diversify their crops next sea
son and thus maintain high prices for
cotton.

London, Dec. 15. The Rumanian
town of Duzeu has been captured by
the Teutonic forcea, Berlin announced
today, further stating that the re
treating Russians are burning villages
as they retire. The taking of Buzeu

endanger the whole line along the
Western Moldavian mountains by
flanking. Berlin claims the capture
of four thousand more Rumanians.

northward in Moldavia beyond the
mouth of the Danube at Galata, may
mean the opening of Bessarabia to In

sition to constitute a threat to the
