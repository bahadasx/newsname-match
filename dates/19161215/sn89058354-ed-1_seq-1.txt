GUTHRIE DIUGU1D .PROMINENT
MURAAY CITIZEN MURDERED
Last Saturday about noon,
Guthrie Diuguid, ex-policerrfan
of Murray, Ky., and one of the
best known and most promi
nently connected men in West
Kentucky, was shot to death
by Lube Martin, negro, on
West Curd" street in Murray.
Causes of the killing have not
yet fully been made public.
Martin, in company with
three other negroes, met Mr.
Diuguid, and it is stated that
theentire party attacked him.
He was shot twice, one bullet
passing entirely through his
body ajiwleft lung. The other
bullet entered his shoulder and
ranged downward.
He was rushed to the hospit
al at Murray, where he died
Sunday afternoon at five 0 -clock.
Martin was arrested by L.
& N. railroad officials Sunday
afternoon near Humboldt, at
the instigation of Deputy Sher
iff H. E. Butler of this city.
The negro was brought to Par
is Sunday afternoon, and from
here was carried to Hopkins
ville for safe keeping. Feeling
in Murray was high, and it was
not thought best to.carry him
back there. ' i "-;
Mr. Diuguid had served as
policeman at Murray for many

Come, dear old Santa Claus! the children now are calling!
Quick may the curtain rise, and let yourself appear.
Loud ring the Christmas bells ; the wintry snow is falling, t
And childhood's mirth will crown the drama of the year.
Long seemed the days to us; our youthful lives were yearning
For all the happy hours of th' good old Christmas time.
Pile on the wood, and keep the cabin-fires a'burning, ,
And let me write for you this simple Christmas rhyme.
Time passes on, 'tis true, but memory still is keeping
- The page afresh of years, alas! long since agone:
Now other children, too, are dreamful in their sleeping,
Will wake, like us, to joys of this glad Christmas morn.
The mistletoe is wreathed : there hangs the festive cluster,"
While maidens sweetly blushand Romance plays the part.
Some crallant heart of vouth true courage tries to muster
To kiss a queenly cheek, and bravely win her heart.
Bedecked are now the rooms with oily-wreath adorning ; . ' '
And spangled trees again, like mystic scenes appear:
What glad surprise returns to hearts on Christmas morning,
When conies this joyful time of all the passing year.
And cornucopia's horn'is filled to overflowing: -v .
' The stockings hung last night Old Nick has found them
all.
Dear hearts of youth I for you the future will be glowing
, :i With' niernory's." scenes of these when' saddened tears

The children of the poorf will Santa Claus forget them?
For them no stockings filled this dear old Christmas day?
Pray! open up your hearts, and never, never, let them
Be saddened with these thoughts as years will pass away.
Come! let us, one and all, forget our deeper sorrow '
Let Christmas Chimes, once more, refresh our lives, and
then, ' '
The thoughts of Christmas tims will gladden many a morrow,
.. "And cheer us ever ontil Christmas comes again. .
Down at the county bastile
sits Bob Hawkins, possibly re
gretting some of the steps he
has taken in his career. It is
an assured fact that he regrets
i of his steps that of at
tempting to enter the local ex
press office more than a week
ago.'
While he sits in jail, the
plot or rather charges a
gainst him thicken. He was
lodged in jail the same morn
ing that he attempted to enter
the express office, having been
trailed to his lair by Night
Chief of the Strong Arm Squad
Harry Hancock., When he was
arrested a set of burglar's tools
was found on him, also a pis
tol and other articles foreign
to the personal regalia of a
law-abiding citizen.
Several weeks ago the Btore
of Dumas' & .Chatman atCot
tage Grove was robbed, a pis
tol and some clothing being
among the articles taken.
Monday, Mr. Dumas identified
the pistol that was found on
the negro as the one that was
taken from his store.
On the same night that the
Dumas & Chatman store was
robbed, a blacksmith shop at
Cottage Grove was broken into
and some of the "burglar's
outfit" of the would-be yegg
has been identified as the pro
perty of the blacksmith shop.
, Hawkins is playing on the
"soft pedal" when it comes to
talking,' but the local sleuths
do not always wait for a man
to convict himself, but get busy
and round up the evidence and
then let him corroborate it.
Hawkins is awaiting the ac
tion of the grand jury, and in
the meantime the local Pink
ertons may locate a few more
of his victims and let them
come in on the benediction that
will be pronounced for him at
the March . term of circuit
court.
CHRISTMAS PAGEANT
CHRISTIAN CHURCH
On Sunday night December
24th, at 7 :15 o'clock, the Bible
School of the First Christian
church will hold its annual
VWtiite Gifts For the King"
. 1 - All
service; tne program lor tms
year being a Christmas page
ant, "The Spirit of Christmas."
At this service the members
of the school bring their pro
visions (white gifts) which
will be made up into baskets
for the poor. A cash offering
is also accepted, the proceeds
going to the Ministerial Relief
Fund.
Anyone who so wishes will
also be given an opportunity
of. making. a. gift of "Self, to
the King."
After a period of uncertain
ty, due to the German and .
English embargoes, the tobac
co market in Henry county has
opened with a grand rush. Ev
ery section is alive with buy
ers offering handsome prices
for crops, and in some instan
ces 12 and 12 12 cents around
has been paid.
The season has been de-
but only a few crops have been
sold, 8 cents being about as
much as has been paid for any
crop up until the past week or
ten days. While this was a
better price than was offered
at any time last season until
just at the close, nearly every
tobacco raiser held for better
prices this season, feeling sure
that it would be more in de
mand when the market stead
ied. - - .
The crop this year is esti
mated at , about ten million
pounds, or a 25 per cent in
crease over the crop of last
year. The last season's crop
was something short of eight
million. The present crop is
the largest that has been
grown in this county for sev
eral seasons past.
A few crops of the weed
were carried from this county
to the Mayfield market early
in the season, it having been
reported that better prices
were being paid at that place
than had been offered by buy
ers here. The Mayfield mar
ket, however, proved to be no
better" than this one, and very
ittle was disposed of there.
Four of the largest handlers
by buyers in Paris, namely :
E. J., O'Brien & Co., of Louis
ville ; Luckett-Wake Tobacco
Co., of Louisville; J. M. Buck
ner & Co., of New York, and
the Italian Regie. These firms
represent practically the nu
cleus of the tobacco handling
business in this country, and
have agents in all tobacco
growing districts. The prices
offered by them or their ag
ents are standard market quo
tations and are practically the
same, at all points in the to
bacco, district, quality cf the
weed considered, of course.
rThe Henry cuonty crop this
year will put a million dollars
into the pockets of. our farm
ers, estimating from the prices
now being offered. This com
ing i on .the heels of the enor
mous cotton crop just market
ed means much to local busi
ness and financial activities.
