J. our military and economie

' continue 1 the war (which has
- been forced xflpon us) until the
. bitter end,; if necessary; at the
V same Jtime prompted by the de
sire to avoid further bloodshed

ties of war, the four, allied pow

' The propdsition which they

' , tence,. of, the honor and liberty
"of ? evolution for their nations
are, acording to their firm belief,
i- ? an appropriate basid for the es-
, tablishment of a lasting peace.
'.Thefoqr allied -powers ,have
been obliged to take op - arms to
defend justice and the liberty of
national volution." The glorious
- deeds of our armies have in." no

justified claimS in. no way con

"Thevspiri ual and material
progress which were the pridel
v of Europe at the beginning of
the Twentieth tJentury are
threatened with ruin. Germany
,-. and her allies, Austro-Hungary
; ; Bulgaria and Turkey, gave proo
of their unconquerable strength
: in this struggle. They .gained
'gigantic advantages over adver

war material. ' Our lines stand.

Drainage Ditch Suggestions
My tax receipt urges me to
revert again to proposed improve
ments off drainage ditch. The
maintainance tax will create a
fund of more than .ten thousand
dollars, properly applied we wi l
have sufficient safe guard against
all ordinary floods, but if used
by ' experimental squads here
and there it will be fritted away
without permanent betterment
of the canal. Faults of engineer
ing should be corrected. , Gaps
in levies filled or diked and a i
even grade of 28 inches to the
mile maintained. This can only
be done by running a dredge the
entire length. 1 would suggest
that our county court fix a day
at its January term a full discus
sion of the matter. - Certainly
the court should be disposed to
do the things desired by the tax
payers who have created the
maintainance fund. I hope the
courier will see its - way to aid
the valley land owners in getting
best possible results from appli
cation of this maintainance fund.
I would suggest also that the
court be urged to publish a full
showing of the now ctatu; of
the drainage debt The ' initial
assessments was about 60 cents
now it is 80 cents (exclusive of
maintainance tax). As alPof the
interest .' and an instalment of
principal is paid each year, we
do not understand why our an
ual tax is . increasing instead of
diminishing. . .

Variety Again; Rose and Thorn
Who is Who and
Whats What '
The half expected happened
again in Salisbury Sunday morn
ing. Periodically' the metropo-
is of this county enjoys a sensa
tion of the same sort which es
tablishes her right to this dis
tinction. Almost any town
can enjoy an annual domestic
explosion but its a live wire that
shocks social sensibilities with a
double geared sensation of only .
momentary duration. Social
ethics do not guarantee immuni
ty from connubial penalties to
absentees nor does lex scripta
protect one who goes to sleep
at the or a switch, so to speak, -
from being ruthlessly or roughjy
disturbed, which leads to the
urther observation that while
all men have an undisputed right
to snooze in the arms of Morph
eus, and Morpheus the undisput
ed right to soporific embrace- .
ment ot any man, unsympathet
ic moral law aided and abetted
by lex non scripta draws the line
at more than one pair of f emine
arms encircling a man . af the
same time. In this particular
case if Morpheus kept awake the
other woman didn't and the doc
trine based on volenti non fit in-. .
juna, was disregarded, by the
interpleader when he arrived at
3 a. m. In fact according to
disinterested witnesses, all plead
ing, disavowal, alibi, habeus
corpus and sundry other
motions . . were . simultaneously
brushed (to use ta mild term)
aside by the party of the third
part and rough-stuff introduced
in lieu thereof.
Not desiring to deprive our
Salisbury contemporaries of, the7
scoop they are entitled to ai d
which they will avail themselves
of undoubtedly, we give no names
or particulars.
