SOLO A MILLION WORTH
' OF HORSE BRANDS IN
CJCONINO COUNTY
Omaha, Neb., Dec. 12. W. W. Mid
dleton of Kansas City, testifying for
the Government in the suit against
the Omaha Land and Investment com
pany and the United States Livestock
company for use of the mails to de
fraud in sales of wild horses in Coco
nino county, Arizona, today asserted
he would have had more success catch
ing deer than the wild horses he had
purchased.
H. B. Halverson, Hettinger, N. D.,
who testified to having lost North
Dakota land worth $3300 in purchase
of wild horses, said "expert cowboys
in Coconino county refused to catch
the horses for $30 a head." When he
complained to A. 0. Perry of Omaha,
one of the defendants, through whom
he purchased the horses, Halverson
said Perry wrote him as follows:
"Find another fellow like yourself
and trade your horses to him. Just
keep quiet, tell no one your troubles,
and get t& trading. That's what I did
and came out all right"
Frank Zeebe, a railroad fireman,
Hastings, Nebr., testified he held Vic
tor Palm, a Hastings real estate man
to account for the horses he pur
chased, but never secured. He testi
fied he chased Palm through the
streets of Hastings, ''laying on" at
at each step with a blacksnake whip."
"It was worth it," he said. "It Vas
worth the $750 I lost"
' The Government alleges that 42
men indicted secured approximately
$1,000,000 from sales of wild horses.
Arizona Ostriches Will Be
Fed to Hogs Around Phoenix
Two years ago. there were more
ostriches in the Salt River Valley than
anywhere else on earth outside of
Africa. They were considered as live
stock and about 8,000 were listed on
the tax rolls. Today it is doubtful if
the valley contains much more than
1,000 of the giant birds, and the num
ber is growing less as fast as dispo
sition can be made of them. Ostrich
breeding has ceased and hundreds of
the birds have been sent to California
and Yuma, and disposed of at bargain
prices, as low as $5 a head, to any
buyer. A few hundred have been
scattered around on the ranches, cared
for with the cattle.
Announcement has just been made
that 100 ostriches on the Chandler
ranches, near Chandler, are to be
killed and the bodies fed to hogs. The
rest of the band of 275 will be shipped
to Yuma. A band of 250 choice birds
will be retained, in the. hope that the
feather market may show some life
in the future.
MEXICANS FIND
BIG OPIUM RING
As the result of the arrest of eight
Americans and fourteen Chinese in a
raid on an alleged opium den in Agua
Prieta, last week the civil official of
the Mexican town, which is across the
international boundary from Douglas,
believe they have uncovered an opium
ring ramifying to Los Agneles, 'San
Francisco, El Paso, Denver and many
other points In the United States. The
prisoners . are being held incommuni-
cado while the investigation is in pro-
i gress.
A report that the gang had opium
valued at fifty thousand dollars stored
in Agua Prieta, awaiting opportunity
to smuggle it across the border here
for distribution through agents in
several large cities, was being investi
gated. CAMPBELL REFUSED
HIS CERTIFICATE
When Tom Campbell called Monday
on Sidney P. Osborn of his certificate
of election the latter refused it, after
having Informed the governor-elect
over the telephone that he would be
the first candidate to receive his pa
pers. Osborn's action is taken to
mean that Senator Ives, representing
Governor Hunt, will apply to the court
for some sort of an order directed to
Osborn, enjoining him from issuing
the election certificate. It is evident
that the Hunt mhine is working
well and that all of the cogs arc well
greased.
RUTHERFORD WANTS TO
HEAD THE SENATE
Senator Chas. ,H. Rutherford, re
cently elected by the people of Yava
pai county to represent them in the
state senate at the coming sessions of

liam Clearidge of Graham county are
also candidates.

dered bV the Navajo Copper Co., by
General Manager Robt. Mitchell, for
their heavy hauling over, the sands,
arrived in Flagstaff the first of the

The big, trucks are some "boats"
and are about the only thing short of
a steam railroad that can negotiate
theBandy country between, here and
the mines. Their work will be slow,
but they will only work a short dis
tance until the ore is transported over
the sandy strip, from .there on into
Flagstaff faster motor bucks will be
used.
The company has millions of tons of
low grade ore in sight on top of the
ground and are still developing more
with a good force of men.

IS THERE A REAL
SANTA CLAUS
There seems to be some real
doubt as to whether or not there
is a real Santa Claus among
many of the young people who
are getting about so old in the
in the present age of the world.
How can a fellow doubt the
fact after all the previous years
of his life?
What if you never did see him !
didn't he ever forget you?
If he did forget you, don't you
think there was some mistake !
about it, because he didn't hap-
pen to find you right away ?
There has been lots of talk
about this and we would like to
know just where the trouble is,
if there is any among the little
folks who are just a little bit in
doubt about the old man.
The Real vSanta Claus is the
Really Greatest Biggest Man
That Ever Happened On This
Great Big Earth. 'Your papa
knew him well; so did mine.
Sometimes he couldn't 'zactly see
over the mortgage on the house
that's a place- above the chim- '
ney, you know,- where kids can't
go; but I've seen pas' begging
for stamps to get letters off in
time to Santa, that made him
sweat harder than if he'd been
shovelin' snow.
If you ever see Santa Claus,
don't grab him by the whiskers
just run right straight into his
arms, for he's the old feller,
without an umbreller that no
storm alarms.
Many an old man knows 'San-
ta, and you just ask him, no
matter if he's as old as "Rimmy
Jim;" he'll tell you true 'tho it's
nuthin' new, that Santa's a man 4
without a clan but one who's love ,
is ajways true.
THE ELECTION OF SHERIFF DICKINSON
CONTESTED ON COMPLAINT OF F. I. SMITH
Since Governor Hunt elected to con
test the election of Tom Campbell for
the office of governor, contests have
become epidemic in the state. The
latest contest to be filed is that of
Fred W. Smith, chairman of the re
publican county central committe
against' the election of Sheriff W. G.
Dickinson, who on the face of the re
turns was elected by 17 votes.
The complaint was filed by attorney
F. .Crablc on behalf of Mr. Smith,

APACHE INDIAN CHARGED
WITH KILLING INDIAN GIRL
After almost 24 hours of continuous
travel, Deputy United States Marshal
J. J. Pecgan accompanied by B. F.
Crawford, returned to Globe from
Fort Apache with John A. Day, an
Apache Indian, accused of murder.
The trip was made in response to a
telegram from the superintendent of
the White Mountain agency who
feared that the presence of the pris
oner at the post might arouse trouble,
as feeling there runs high against the
accused.
Day is said to haveattacked a 13-year-old
Indian girl by the name of
Nancy Hope, and then to have beaten
her brains out with a stone. While
the particulars of the affair are lack
ing, the superintendent of the agency
claims to have a strong chain of cir
cumstantial evidence against the man.
The latter was given his preliminary
examination at the agency, and
brought to Globe on a committment
Special Pullman to Phoenix
In order to accommodate all those
wishing to take advantage of the holi
day rates to Phoenix, the local office
here has secured a special Pullman
sleeping car for their patrons, which
will leave Flagstaff next Thursday
evening.
Many students of the Normal, will
take advantage of the special ar
rangements to visit their homes south
during the holidays.
Bunk House at Riordan Burns
The railroad bunk house at Riordan
burned down last Monday afternoon,
caused by fire, but no one seems to
know what caused the fire. It was one
of the antique style of bungalows
built of ties for the use of Mexican
section hands along the line. We me
rely mention this in contradistinction
from the Fra Marcus, Escalante and
other such places along the line, not
including the Flagstaff daypoo, and
nights worse.

THINGS 01 INTEREST FROM
THE BIG NORMAL SCHOOL
The May Seniors are preparing a
dance in honor of the Christmas Se
niors. The affair will be held in the
Dining Hall Friday night.
Hubert Coulson was suddenly called
home Tuesday on account of the ill
ness of his father at Cornville on the
Verde. He will return for the seme
ster examinations, it is thought.
Mary Duffy of Bury Hall recently
left for home in Nogales to remain
until after the Christmas holidays.
Her recent attack of apendicitis has
made her too weak to continue school
work. She will probably undergo an
operation while at home.
A feature of the Dining Hall this
week is the presence of the. Senior
table which it is customary to have
the nveek preceding commencement
The lonesome boy of the class, "Ham"
acts as head of the table.
Miss Marguirite Irvine left this
week for her home in Phoenix. The
young lady was called suddenly from
school on account of the sudden death
of her father who "was some eighty
years of age. She will not return to
school this term.
Ui S. George, who has been bedrid
den for some seven weeks with blood
poisoning as a result of too much foot
ball is now able to be around again.
He is still lame and unable to "get in
the game" yet but can walk arourid
with comparative ease.
cient number of votes illegally cast
and other irregularities that would
change the result. No specific charges
were made against the candidate, but
on a general basis, similar to the
charges filed by Hunt's attorneys in
his contest case.
The charges or irregularities at the
Saginaw logging camp, which precinct
was held up temporarily until directed
to be counted by theiattoreny general,
will probably be one of the strongest
points of the contest.
COMMISSION EXTENDS
FREIGHT RATE HEARING
On the request of the Atchison, To
peka & Santa Fe Railway Company
their application for authority to ad
vance freight rates 20, was post
poned from Monday, December 11,
1910, to Monday, January 8, 1917.
This involves a horizontal increase of
20 on all intra-state freight rates
I and is a matter of great importance
.to the shippers and receivers of
, freight on the Santa 'Ee lines.
The application and petition of T.
M. Quebedcsux and K. H. Myers for
certificate of convenience and neces

ARIZONA SOLDIERS WANT
A SQUARE DEAL
In view of the fact that recently
the national guard of several states
has been relieved from border duty
and sent home, it .would appear that
the Arizona National Guard should
receive some attention in this respect,
and several hundred citizens of Gra-
I ham county have signed a petition,
I asking that Safford Company B, First
Arizona Infantry, be relieved from
further border duty.
The petition is .addressed to Presi
dent Wilson. Safford Guardian.
HARRY EMBACH'S FATHER
DIES SUDDENLY IN CHICAGO
Harry Embach, secretary of the Co
conino Cattle Grower's Association,
was summoned to his old home in Chi
cago yesterday by the unexpected in
formation of the death of his father.
He was out on the range at the time
a telegram arrived advising him of
the sudden illness of his father, but
before he could be reached another te
legram arrived advised him of the
death of his father.
Mr. Embach Sr., had been in Flag
staff a couple times, the guest of Har
ry, .during the past few years and
made many friends here during his
short trips. , Harry has the sincere
sympathy of a large number of
friends here in his sudden and unex
pected bereavement
Miss Gardner, the musical director,
I is working on some choruses for bac-
calaureatc and commencement exer
jcises. The men's and ladies' Glee
' Clubs are working together to furnish
, the music.
I Mr. Honn has made the announce
ment that all students who are sure
I of carrying all their subjects may re
gister any time for the second seme
Jster's work. Evidently a good many
siuuenis are oi mat opinion judging
from the popularity of the registra
tion office the last few days. Here's
hoping the faculty view matters in
(the same light.
Contrary to the usual custom of
holding the semester examinations on
the Monday and Tuesday of Com
mencement week, the faculty have
ruled that regular work shall continue
up until Tuesday noon next. Of course,
the regular amount of worrying and
cramming is being caVried on by the
wayward students who are sorely
afraid of "flunking."
The plague of German measles that
has been infesting the campus for the
last few weeks seems to be subsiding
in intensity. Only a few cases are
now reported. None of the patients
have been ill and an attack has been
considered as more or less of a joke.
However, the most careful pains have
been taken to prevent the spread of
the malady and there is yet a nurse in
each of the girls' dormitories to look
after the "injured" ones,

U. S. FISH HATCHERY SEND
- CATFISH FOR LAKElARf
A can of young catfish was received
here by John Francis yesterday from
the U. S. Fish hatchery to be dumped
into their new home at Lake Mary.'
This lake has developed into a splend
id fishing grounds since black bass
were placed in it a few years ago and
it was thought that added varieties
would lend more zest to the sport of
fishing there.
Forest Supervisor J. D. Guthrie also
received a consignment of, black bass
from the U. S. hatchery to be placed
in Mormon Lake, the only big lake
around Flagstaff that does not now
contain fish. For some reason no fish
have heretofore been secured for this
lake, though it is the biggest lake In
this section of the country having a
circumference of over fifteen miles.
The lake is twenty five miles out, con
sequently is not quite as popular as
the other lakes closer in. However
it will be one of the popular resorts
as population increases and roads are
improved.
STATE. COMMITTEE ASKS AID
FOR CAMPBELL'S CONTEST
The Republican State Central com
mittee, realizing the amount of money
placed behind the contest brought by
Governor Hunt by members of his ad
ministration and office holders to oust
Campbell from the office honestly
won, are asking republicans and
friends of Campbell regardless of
political belief, to make some con
tribution to the Campbell fund to
assist him in making his fight for his
rights.
Governor-elect Campbell is not
financially able to stand the costs
forced upon him and his friends
throughout the state have been asked
to contribute whatever amount they
may be able no matter how small, to
carry on the fight
Any contributions may .be made to
John Zalaha at the Arizona Central
bank, who will see that they reach the
proper person.
It is a poor .man's fight, consequent
ly anything from two-bits up will be
acceptable.
Border Guard Is Expensive ;
Majl Gen. Sharpe, quartermaster
general of the army, told the house
military committee that the war de
partment faced a $25,000,000 deficit
now on account of the extraordinary
expense of the border mobilization,
and predicted that if the national
guard were kept there until June, with
a strength of 75,000, the delicit .would
be ?50,000,000.
Toll Line to Grand Canyon
L. C. Riley, local manager of the
Mountain States Telephone Company,
was in Ash Fork recently on business.
He returned by the way of the Grand
Canyon to map out the best route for
a toll line 'from Flagstaff to the
Grand Canyon."
Logging Car Wheels Run Over
Body But Will Get Well
Wm. Ahl, the young man who was
run over by two wheels of a logging
car last week on the Flagstaff Lum
ber Co., logging road is getting along
fine at the Milton hospital with every
indication of ultimate recovery.
That he will live to tell the tale of
having let a logging car run over his
body is one of the miracles that
once in many times happen. His
exact position on the rails when the
wheels run over him, seems to have
presented the strongest portion of his
body in resistence. The point of one
hip was. crushed and the other only
fractured; the strength of these two
bones kept the weight off his abdo
men, thus saving his life.
OUR NEW PRESSMAN
The Sun has been endeavoring
for some "time to secure the ser
vices, of a competant pressman
who could properly handle half
tone and other work of a high
class, and were fortunate in se
curing the services of Mr. Frank
Bolls, who has put in years of
time with the best printing shops
in the east, on picture printing
as well as color work. None of
the patrons of the Suiuwill be in
least disappointed in the high
class of press work he can turn
out, for he has had years of ex
perience and is in no sense an
apprentice that will have to be
taught anything in his line of
work. The Sun believes in secur
ing high class labor and is will
ing to pay for it to give patrons
what they want.

T. J. MAHONEY TO BUILD
NEW jlER BUILDING
T. J. Mahoncy has secured the con
tract to build the new Bikkcr building
for which excavation is now being
made on east Aspen avenue.
The building is to be completed and
ready for occupancy by the Penney
Co., by March 1st, next.
Mr. Mahoncy has some job on his
hands in handling concrete for the
foundation and putting in the mason
work during the cold weather, but has
made preparations to see that the
concrete is properly handled and put
down under conditions that will per

There will be a full basement of 25x
80 feet, the front to be of Ios Angeles
pressed brick with a modern plate
glass front.
Aspen avenue is rapidly becoming
the business street of the city since
Mr. Bikkcr and the Sun office moved
down that way and the Bikker block
will soon be completely covered with
business buildings. Property in this
section has advanced a hundred per
cent during the past year.
T. E. POLLOCK VICTIM OF
RUNNAWAY TEAM LAST WEEK
T. E. Pollock narrowly escaped se
rious injuries in a- runnaway last Fri
day afternoon on the north road, and
as it was received a bad cut on the
forehead, and was considerably bruised
up by his fall from the light wagon.
The team of young horses became
frightened at something and one of
the .Jeam reared up breaking the neck
yoke strap; it was impossible to hold
the team without pulling the wagon
onto their heels. With good horse
manship he managed to keep them in
the road for a time' but eventually
they collieded with a telephone pole
throwing him out, cutting a bad gash
in his forehead and bruising him up
considerably.
The New Elks' Home
If there is not a new Elks' home
going up here next summer, there will
be a person of. rotund compilation and
complexion, branded Meyers, with "J.
C." ob both front feet, who will be
lacking in larnyx, throax and voca
bulary. Some of the old ten-prong-
Elks felt last year that a new home
might at that time be on slippery skids
and no chains, with foggy weather
ahead, but most of the old ten and
fifteen prong bimch' feel that they can
hand it to the two and three-prong
bunch for staying put with a firm
purpose of making the Elks' home a
real Elks' home the coming year. So,
if you find the Elks springing things
this winter pretty strong you may
know that it is either for the new
home or for a purpose that you would
gladly see your money going to.

Brakeman Blair Badly Injured
Brakeman J. J. Blair will lose a
foot as a result of an accident which
occurred near McLellan Sunday, and
was otherwise badly injured. At last
accounts. he was holding up well while
bejng taken to the hospital at Los An
geles. , N
While nearing McLellan the freight
train broke in two precipitating him
to the track below; his left foot was
crushed, his right knee and elbow
badly injured by the fall. Later it
was thought that a part of his foot
could be saved.
Escaping with his life seems mira
culous, falling between the two sec
tions of the train as he did, but in his
fall he must have been thrown to the
outer edge of the track where only
one foot was caught beneath the
wheels.
Amalgamated Mine Will Be a Winner

A red hot little blaze made the fire

It originated in the small store room
back of the boarding house on the
