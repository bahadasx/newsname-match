LUKE M'LUKE 8AYS:
When some men tell you that they
are looking for an opening they mean
that they have a corkscrew and a beer
cap remove!4 on their key rings.
Another sure thing Is that the gray
hairs in a woman's head are prema
ture. .
The reason why the married man
who has never seen a naval vessel,
knows all about dreadnaughts is be
cause he married one.
Another reason for the High Cost of
Living la that there are Ave shopping
days in a week and only one pay day.
When you do a favor for some peo
ple they act as If they were being
done.
Tell a woman how pretty she Is look
ing and she will hunt up a show win
dow as soon as she leaves you and will
powder her nose.
These Society lads may Imagine mat
they have a lot of Polish. But most of
the specimens we have examined are
merely there with Varnish,
Aftr the Honeymoon the Sunshine
of Tour Life ofton puts in the rest of
her time making it hot for you.
The Mlsorlty Is always right when
you happen to be in the Minority.
A man's Idea of a corking good time
s what his wife would term an un
corking good time.
The only time a man gets more than
he expects In this world Is when he
goes out looking for trouble.
Like other men you Imagine that
you are a popular speaker. Well, hire
a hall and charge a dollar a throw for
admission to hear you, and you will
wake up.
The difference between Africa, where
men buy their wives, and this country
is that in this country the wife doesn't
know that she has been sold until af

THE MAGOFFIN GOUNTY
FRAUD CASES IN COURT
- , - , -,, '
F,FTY'SEVEN PER80NS UNDER
INDICTMENT FOR MISUSE.
OF MAIL8.
The United States Court In session
at Catlettsburg took up the 67 cases
against Magotlln county persons charg
ed with using the nulls to defraud, and
continued them until the first Monday
In July, a special term being called for
that time to try these cases.
Magollin county has a lot of good
citizens and It Is no reduction upi
them to say that It also appears to con
tain more industrious rascals aHing
certain lines than any other cuwfty in
the whole country. For years they
have carried on fraudulentpractices
that have resulted In defruding mer
chants and manufacturers out of thou-
I"""'! dollars worth of goods. The
j postolflce inspectors have spent a great
. deal Of time in trying to land these
fellows, but usually they have kept
' barely clear of a violation of the pos-
'aws. finally they grew bolder and
the bunch now held for trial are charg
ed with gross violations.
Almost every line la Included In the
swindles -and nearly all the large cities
have sufTered. It Is estimated that tt0,
000 worth were obtained without pay
ing for any.
The "State Bank of Brownlow" "and
"The Rex Bank" were ficticious banks
used for reference by some of the swin
dlers. Stationery and a typewriter was
all the assets possessed by the banks,
but that was sufficient to satisfy the
wholesale dealers and manufacturers
as to the reliability of those who were
in on- the scheme and used it for ref
erence. The goods obtained without
cost were Sold Tit any price obtainable,
It la alleged.
One man even 'ocered to sell a pair
of 84 shoes to a U. S. Inspector., it is
claimed. The Inspector tells how he
was riding along the' creek when ac
costed by ah elderly man carrying sev
eral pairs of shoes over his shoulders.
The Inspector, after declining the man's
offer to sell him a pair cheaply,' asked
him where he got the shoea and how
he could sell them at such a low cost.
"I can't hear very well," 'he old
mountaineer replied, and passed on his
way. ' t
The federal agents encountered in
numerable difficulties, in locating some
of the mountaineers. When they ask
ed for any particular person they were
told he was "up the creek or down the
creek" or "he's gone over Into Morgan
county." The very telephones obtained
on credit from two big manufacturing
concerns were used to give warning of
the approach of suspicious strangers,
it is declared.
One 82,000 "wholesale establishment
turned out to be a log cabin with one
room and an aula.
Some mountaineers. It Is claimed.
would represent themselves as owning
real estate, possessing goods and live
stock, whereas a dozen of them on a
promissory note would not make the
note worth 8100, one government man
asserted.
One Arm which sought to make col
lections was ltself sued for sending lm
pure products Into Inter-state traffic,
it Is claimed.

gal battle In Kentucky over the,antl-
pass law which goes Into effect In the
Bluegrass State on January 1., This
law is said to be mure drastic than any
state law now In force against the Is
suing of free transportation. No of-

not, Is entitled to free transportation. -

fice men, hold minor state, county or
city positions in Kentucky. 'Some are
Mayors In small towns. Even railroad
police receive commissions from the
state and come under the law, accord
ing to some interpretations of it, while

high official of a road. Scores of notary
pub 11 a, commissions have been turned
