THEY FAVOR BETTER
iVIESJOR PUPILS
Columbia Mothers Endorse
Movement to Improve the
Silent Drama.
LIKE THE 'PIED PIPER'
Motion Pictures Greatlvin
fluence Children, Says
School Teacher.
The better movies for children
movement was indorsed by the Ben
ton School Mothers' Club after it was
Introduced by Mrs. W. B. Gage, Mrs.
A. M.Gardner of tha Civic League, and
Mrs. M. D. Lewis of the Columbia
public schools. The A. C. A has also
come to the support of the movement
Miss Louise Nardin, secretary of the
A C. A. and chairman of the drama
committee, says that, although A C.
A. has not met to endorse the move
ment formally, she has interviewed
the drama committee and most of the
members who are heartily in favor of
it. Because of its success in other
places. Miss Nardin is confident of
its success here.
"We start in life yielding to the
strongest influence," said Miss Ella V.
Dobbs, who spoke on "Clean Recrea
tions." We should make the right in
fluence the strongest by making it
the pleasantest. By putting at Its
head something compellingly attrac
tive, like the Pied Piper we should be
able to lead the children up the
straight and narrow path to a merry
tune. The "better movies" plan
one of the merry tune's of the Piper."
Miss Dobbs urges that we should
provide for the gang spirit in boys
and girls by organizing dramatic
clubs, orchestras, and by using the
school house afternoons and evening'
for social gatherings.
"On Mondays and Tuesdays you
can tell what kind of pictures the
children have seen the previous
week-end," said Miss Neil Crumbattch
of Benton School, v?ho claims that Ufa'
Influence of the movies is very evident
on 'the playground, and should there
fore be made a good one. The boys
turn their hats inside out and, in
imagination, rob and shoot the place
up.
Mrs." Lewis described the "better
movies" movement as the biggest step
forward that the mothers' clubs of
Columbia have ever taken.
Other business taken up by the club
was the providing of material for the
new Sally Flood Memorial Library,
which was dedicated October 13. As
far as It is able, the Mothers' Club
will buy the books for the library,
but books contributed by anyone will
be welcome.
Fire at Chi Omega House.

the girls at the Chi Omega sorority

DTRICT
COMMITTEE TO PLAN
CIVIC IMPROVEMENTS
O. D. Kellogg Says Council
manic Board Will Help
Beautify City.
ARE TO ADVISE ONLY
With Co-Operation of Citi
zens Future Growth Will
Follow Definite Plan.
WHAT IS CITY PLANNING?
It is a plan by which the physical
part of the city is made beautiful.
It is an effort to improve civic con
ditions. it means a uniform and compre
hensive parking system.
It means the elimination of an in
consistent and inadequate street
system.
It cultivates the spirit of civic pride.
The foregoing were the views ex
pressed by Councilman Oliver D. Kel
logg when asked to explain the func
tion and purpose of the city planning
committee recently appointed in the
City Council. The other members of
the committee are Councilmen Lee
Walker and Percy Klass.
"A city, particularly a small city,
has a tendency to grow without plan.
It grows piece-meal. There Is usually
a lack of style and .system in Its de
velopment, and the city planning com
mittee was proposed in order to at
tempt to Introduce more foresight and
system in the growth of Columbia,"
said Councilman Kellogg.
"The city planning committee will
endeavor to bring about a uniformity
of streets, elimination of dangerous
traffic, and making Columbia beauU
ful on an economical and efficient
basis. The committee will make an
effort to avoid such traffic complica
tion as may be found on Hltt street
and Broadway. Suggestions will be
offered to citizens, for Improvement of
the parking and sidewalk systems,
and advice will be given real estate
agents who are opening up new sec
tions of land. The capacity of the
committee will be advisory.
"The city planning committee,"
said Councilman Kellogg, "will study
the classes of traffic and the prob
able change in the character and
amount of traffic after the improve
ment of the street There will be a
consideration of the character of cross
streets, and the determination of
proper widths of roadways.
"In Columbia there is a lack of uni
formity in sidewalks and parking.
The sidewalks are of various widths.
while there is no system in parkings
or the planting of trees. The result
is that every year there are conflicts
between property owners and the
telephone company or the water
plant
"This condiUon Is not peculiar to
Columbia, but Is found in most'cSUes
where some plan is not nsed to make
uniform the development of the city,
and this is the purpose of the city
planning committee.
"I am not certain that the commit
tee will accomplish much," said Mr.
Kellogg, "but I feel as if it is a step
in the right direction. The commit
tee wants the spirit of co-operation
on the part of the citizens In this
movement of realizing 'city beautiful'
Ideals for Columbia."
