date Across Tracks in Front
of Train
Ogdensburg, N. Y., Oct. 28.—Charles
E. Hughes told an audience here to­
night that if he were elected president
lie"would protect Americans' rights on
land and sea. "There must be with
us. as with our fathers," he added, ''a
willingness to sacrifice for the country
that we love."
He spoke chiefly on Republican pol­
icies affecting agriculture, subordinat
ing other campaign issues. The pro­
tective tariff, the "need" for prepara­
tion to meet the competition of an
energized Europe, after the war, and
the Adamson law, were the chief top­
ics. Maintenance of American rights
on land and sea, he declared, was es
I sential to all prosperity and progress.
Patriotic Sentiment Needed.
"We shall accomplish nothing in
I this country unless we have the driv­
ing power of patriotic sentiment," he
declared. "There is no future for a
decadent people. We do not want war.
I am amazed at the audacity of the
assertions that a vote for me is a vote
for war. I am a man devoted to peace.
As I look forward to the future, there
is nothing that I more keenly desire
than an international organization
which will lend to promote the peace
of Hie world, when this awful conflict
is at an end.
"You cannot hope to maintain your
I peace if you present to the world, the
spectacle of timid people that has for­
gotten the courage and indominitable
spirit of the founders and preservers
of (bis nation. A people that backs
lam) backs and talks and talks and
never spans. There is no peace for
11lie United States with such a policy."
Hughes Nearly Run Down.
Mr. Hughes was nearly run down by
I his own special train at Osweko. A
nervous chauffeur drove the automo­
bile containing the nominee past the
landing at the railway station, direct
ly across the tracks in front of the
slowly approaching train. A sharp
I curve and a cut hid the train from
view and the blaring of a brass band
drowned the noise of its approach.
Hundreds of persons were massed
about the car.
When the engine came into view, it
I was less than thirty feet from the
automobile. The chauffeur backed in
to the car behind and the engineer
jammed in the emergency brakes. The
combination prevented an accident.
There was a scramble for safety by
the crowd and no one was injured.
Mr. Hughes campaigned today
I among the farmers of Northern New
York.

Elisio Arredondo, Mexican ambas­

cials asserted emphatically that Mr.
Arrendondo had not been consulted
before the statement was issued and
had no knowledge that it was in con­
templation, his first knowledge of it
coming after the bureau had distribut­
ed it to the newspapers.
Among the theories advanced to­
night in quarters familiar with Mexi­
can politics, was that Mr. Cabrera in­
tended his criticism for consumption
in Mexico more than in the iJnited
States and hoped they might placate
his chief and soften Carranza's in­
sistent demand that Cabrera have the
American troops wlthdrown from the
border.

WASHINGTON OFFICIALS
REFUSE TO COMMENT
Washington, Oct.. 28.—New compli­
cations with the Mexico de facto gov­
ernment were threatened today as the
result of a statement issued here
through the Mexican information bu­
reau and attributed to Luis Cabrera.
It assails in sharp language American
neutrality, and the adminstration of
immigration laws as regards Mexico.
Mr. Cabrera is minister of finance in
Carranza's cabinet, and president of
the Mexican commission now partici­
pating in the joint conference over
border difficulties, at Atlantic Gity,
and there are indications that his crit­
icisms will not be ignored at the state
department.
While refusing to enter into any dis­
cussion of the statement at this time,
administration officials characterized
it as extraordinary. Secretary Lan­
sing would make no comment. It
was known, however, that steps to es­
tablish the authenticity of the docu­
ment were taken under consideration

Ethel Garnant, at Age of 10, Is
Just Learning to Eat After
Throat Passage Is Opened
Weight Falls to 38 Pounds,
By HONOR FANNING.
Waukegan, III., Oct. 28.—Hungry
for 12 years!
Sitting daily at a table filled with
tempting food daily preparing food
for others that she could not taste
herself famishing in a house of plen­
ty!
That was the experience of Ethel
Garnant, 19-year-old school girl, who
is just learning how to eat.
Air "explosion" operation has just
been performed by Dr. Charles H.
Mayo of Rochester, iMinn., to save
Miss Garnant from death by starva­
tion.
This is the story as Ethel herself
tells it, of the 12-year fast and of
the "intestinal explosion" that fairly
blew her back from death to a razor
edged appetite.
"1 have been hungry since 1 was
seven," iMiss Garnant said. "They
used to call me the 'little gourmand,'
I ate so much.
"One night at supper my bread and
milk wouldn't go down. I choked
Since that night 1 did not swallow any
solid food until Dr. Mayo told me to
'go ahead and eat, eat everything and
lots of it.' I didn't need a second in­
vitation.
"I had been fasting almost 10 years
before doctors—and mother had con­
sulted at least 100 of them—could dis­
cover what ailed me.
"Then they said the esophagus, the
gullet, you know, was contracted and
the opening so small only the thin­
nest and hottest liquids could pass
through.
"I weighed only ?8 pounds, and I
was 17 years old! A mere skeleton.
"I had to quit going to school.
Mother kept me alive some way on
broths and soups. I don't suppose
anyone in the world ever drank so
much soup. And I was hungry all the
time.
"When the operation was perform­
ed it seems they slipped a string with
chemicals on the end, down this eso­
phagus passage.
The heat of the body acted on the
chemicals and there was aterrific ex­
plosion.
"It was like when a firecracker goes
off, but it was no Fourth of July pic­
nic for me. The pain was so great
I fainted.
"In an hour or so I was all right
again. In three hours I was asking
for something to eat and I did eat.
Um! that juicy steak! And sweet
potatoes—four of them.
"1 didn't take any broth at my first
dinner. I have a feeling I will never
care for soups of any kind again."
Despite her hunger, Miss Garnant
kept up her studies and will prepare
for a business career.

Colonel Claims President Should
Have Done Dictating After
Placing Troops on Border
New York, Oct 2S.—Theodore Roos­
evelt, speaking tonight before an aud­
ience that filled the Academy of Mu­
sic, in Brooklyn, arraigned the Wil­
son administration for what he char­
acterized the policy of "wobbling be
ween feeble peace, feeble war and
feeble peace again."
The Mexican members of the Mexi­
can-American joint commission, ac­
companied by their wives, and Dr.
John R. Mott, one of the American
commissioners, occupied a box at the
meeting.
Col. Roose^falt dwelt at considerable
length on the administration's Mexi­
can policy and declared that it would
have been infinitely better to have
kept General Pershing and the Amer­
ican troops out of Mexico than to
have "put them in" in the manner in
which the administration did.
President Wilson, the former presi
dent asserted, should have said, after
the troops once were in Mexico: "Mr,
Carranza, you say we cannot use the
railroads. Well, guess again." The
Mexican commissioners apparently
were only interested in hearing Col.
Roosevelt express his opinion on the
Mexican situation for they neither ap­
plauded nor made any comment. When
the former president had finished,
they left the hall without remaining
to meet him.

Improvement
MINE ANTICIPATES ITS
BIGGEST YEAR'S OUTPUT
John Crosby, a member of the
Washburn-Crosby milling company,
and executor of the W. D. Washburn
estate B. W. Stevenson, president of
the Washburn Lignite Coal Co.. and a
member of the Russell-Miller Milling
Co., and W. H. Keller, secretary of the
coal company, spent last evening in
Bismarck after completing a satis­
factory inspection of the mine at Wil­
ton. Messrs. Crosby and Keller re­
turned last night to Minneapolis,
while Mr. Stevenson went west on
business connected with the Russell
Miller company.
Shaft Big Improvement.
The new tipple recently erected at
No. 2 shaft and the additional open­
ings which have been made one mile
east of the original workings form a
big improvement. The cost, of the
work was $40,000, but the new equip­
ment will more than pay for itself
in the greater economy of which it will
admit in raising the coal. The under­
ground haulage had become a very ex­
pensive item, with some of the cham­
bers a mile distant from the old shaft.
The eastern section of the mine now
will be worked from No. 2 shaft, and
the haul will be reduced considerably.
Doubles Capacity.
The opening of the second shaft will
double the capacity of North Dakota's
largest coal mine. The maximum
heretofore has been 1,200 tons daily,
while the company can now easily
handle 2,500 tons. The demand for
lignite is the greatest the company
has ever known, and because the val­
ue of this fuel is becoming more gen­
erally recognized and by reason of
the bituminous coal shortage in the
east, the Washburn company antici­
pates a banner year's business. A oar
shortage is the only difficulty whiili
confronts the mine at present.
The officials came in Friday noon
and were met here by Supt. W. P.
Macomber, who accompanied them to
Wilson. They made the return trip
yesterday with G. W. Stewart, proprie­
tor of the Wilton News, who drove
down.

St. Paul, Minn.. Oct. 28.—.Minneso­
ta's national guardsmen, of legal age,
absent from the state in federal serv­
ice, will vote the national, state and
local ticket of their home precincts
in the general election of November
7, under the provisions of a measure
passed unanimously late today by an
extraordinary session of the state leg­
islature.
Within six hours from the time the
two houses of the state law making
machine were called to order, at 11
o'clock a. m., the bill enfranchising
the guardsmen, another providing for
the execution of its provisions, and
an appropriation bill covering ex­
penses of the special session had been
passed and adjournment taken in both
bodies.
Tonight the measures were being
engrossed by Chief Clerk Arneson of
the house, preparatory to their sub­
mission to Governor J. A. A. Burn­
quist, who had signified his intention
of signing them immediately upon re­
ceipt.
Six commissioners, who under the
provision of the law will go to the
Mexican border to take the guards­
men's vote, were named tonight by
the governor.
The bill making it possible for the
state troops to vote was adopted with
a few minor amendments as drawn by
the attorney, general's office. None of
the details for taking the vote were
eliminated, but a few minor additions
were made.

The auto campaigners who made a

An excellent meeting was held at
Driscoll on Friday eve.r'ng, and yes­
terday large crowds turned out every­
where. At Regan more 'lian peo­
ple heard Secretary of State. Thomas
Hall and F. E. Packard, chairman of
the state tax commission.
The secretary of stare discussed the
changing character of politician.*. who
are required under the present prima
rry laws to get out and meet the eo
ple and place themselves generally on
view. iMr. Hall stated that a better
class of men are offering themselves
for public service, and that the gov­
ernment of the state is bein, placed
in capable hands.
Politics and Taxation.
Chairman 'Packard of the tax com­
mission gave an interesting talk on
taxes and their relation to politics.
He urged a more active interest in
politics on the part of the taxpayer,
pointing to the fact that Xorth Da­
kota's per capita tax is more than
$25, or $125 the year for an average
family of five, and that to earn that
money would require an average of
days' labor.

north end of the county, the first stop
being made at Arena. A large num­
ber of people turned out at Wing. Wil­

Reviews Sending of Lusitania
Note and Gives History of
Postscript Attached
REVIEWS RESIGNATION
OF SEC. WILLIAM BRYAN
Somerville, Mass., Oct. 28.—The as­
sertion that President Wilson, at the
time the second Lusitania note was
sent to Germany, wrote and afterward
withdrew a postscript informing the
German government that the contents
of his previous note were not to be
interpreted too seriously, was reiter­
ated by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge
in a political address here tonight.
The senator added to his statement
that announcement on the subject
had come to him in a letter from Dr.
Charles H. Bailey of the Tufts
cal school, in which Henry E'recken
ridge, formerly assistant secretary of
war, was quoted as authority for the
story of the alleged postscript.
Senator Lodge reviewed the send­
ing of the Lusitania note, and the
resignation of Secretary of State Bry­
an. He continued:
"There was one feature about which
there was much speculation at the
time, and that is why Mr. Bryan al­
lowed his name to be appended to a
very strong note, couched in the most
extreme language possible to diplom­
acy, and yet resigned so that he need
not affix his signature to the very
mild note of June 9, a note which
even a man of very strong pacifist
tendencies could not have objected to.
Jt was currently reported at the time
that the reason for the apparently in­
explicable action on Mr. Bryan's part
was the fact that the first note, as
finally sent, was not the note to which
he had appended his signature. With­
in a few days, there has come into
my possession, direct information on
this subject, contained in the follow­
ing letter, addressed to Grafton Cush
ing. who forwarded it to me. This
writer. Dr. Charles H. Bailey, profes­
sor in the Tufts Medical school, is a
gentleman of high standing and un­
doubted veracity."
