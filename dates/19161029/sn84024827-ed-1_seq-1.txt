Hypocraqj Charge Is Hurled at
President In Bitterest Speech

and Humiliation, v
CHARGES COWARDICE,
DISHONOR, TO WILSON
"If We Should Enter Next
War. We Should Enter
This," Says T. R. Charging
Wilson With Insincerity. !
(By Review Leased, Wire)
NEW YORK,. Oct 28 Theodore
Roosevelt, in an address at the
Brooklyn 'Academy of Music to
night, declared that if today is
what "our Democratic friends"
call "Wilson Day" it should be
"appointed a day of fasting wd
humiliation."
"THREE YEARS OF SHAME"
"For during the past three
years," he went on,! "the people
of the United States have eaten
the bitter bread of shame and
trcd the paths of dishonor under
the leadership of Mr. Wilson.",
The Colonel directed njst of his
attack against the recent declaration
of Mr. Wilson that the present was
the Jast great world war that the
United States "n keep out of.
"Wilson Violates Word."
"We never have had any candidate
for so high an office who was so utter
ly indifferent to the ' reversal jf all
his professed convictions or principles
and, above all, so lndicerent to the
flat contradiction between his word
and his acts on almost every issue of
real tmportance before the people," he
said.
Is Wilson Hypocrite? -
After quoting the President's
words in regards to this country
and the next war, Mr. Roosevelt
said that "never have we had a
greater degree of insincerity and
hypocrisy than is contained in
such a plea for re-election by the
President, who has, himself, prac-.'
ticed the coldest and most selfish
neutrality when all these things
that be in the abstract condemns
were in the concrete committed
at the expense f Belgium and of -the
Armenians and the Syrian
Christians.
Taking up the President's "appeal
for support, on the ground that be has
kept us out of war," Mr. Roosevelt de
clared that if it was just to keep out
of the present war, then it would be
just in the future to keep out of all
similar wars, and "if the President,
on the other hand, -is right in saying
that we never shall keep out of any
such wars in the future, then he con
demns himself for keeping out of this
war."
Act of Cowardice?
"You say, Mr. Wilson, that here
after America must exert her whole
force, moral and physical, throughout
the round globe if the fundamental
rights of humanity are invaded." CoP
nel Roosevelt said. "Do you know
that it is object cowardice to say that
this must be done hereafter when
you do not dare do it now?
Says Wilson "Chatters."
"If ju mean what you say as the
future, then you must mean precisely
and exactly that this is your duty in
the present. Do it now, Mr. President,
it is your sheer hypocrisy to chatter
ten days before election as to what
ought to be done in the future, when
throughout your wh'jle term of office
you have failed in the present to do
what you now say is your duty." If
the President's words can mean any
thing, the Colonel continued, "and
never again are we to be neutral
then he is inexcusable in having kept
us so shamefully unprepared."

LONG BRANCH, N. J.. Oct. 23
That the opposition of his election
"is scrupling at nothing" in statement
or art or policy was the charge made
by Resident Wilson in a speech at
Shadow Lawn this afternoon to a
throng thnt assembled for a joint cel
ebration or New York Day and Wood
row Wilson Day.
"What are wt r say," he asked
"of the patriotism of men who
take advantage of a crisis of the
world when the fortunes of men
hang in uncertain balance, when
the peace of this great nation can
be maintained only by the most
thoughtful and considerate means
to settle a question of power
amng themselves?"
Defiance, G. O. P. Method
Renewing his discussion of the for
eign policies of the United States and
speaking of the vocal element of the
Republican party, the President de
clared :
"They prefer peace that Is pro
duced by the methods of those who
defy, of those who brag, or those who
threaten in order to establish their
prowess. They have forgotten their
manners. They want a peace indeed,
but they do not want a peace ob-
i tained as gentlemen obtain it
but on-
ing gyrations" or the Republicans to
ward the tariff and replied to asser
tions of his opponents as to what will
happen after the war.
Appeal to New York
Direct reference to the New York
campaign was made by Mr. Wilson
for the first time. He mentioned Sam
nel Seabury. candidate for governor,
by name, and urged that a Democratic
governor and United States senator
should be elected.
The President did not reaj a speech
prepared by him in advance. Al
though he used some of the thoughts
contained in the prepared speech, he
departed entirely from the words and
Injected many new ideas. The pre
pared speech was to be read at meet
