Eprr.al to Thn World.
NIV Y()i:K, Oct. 28--Vuiicu 8.
lonc, grand chief engineer of
tin) F.rotherhood of Locomotive. Kn
ginecrs und one of the four men
chiefly responsible for driving the
Adamson law through congress under
threat of a nutlcm-wittc tie up of the
railroads, has made formal udiiitssion.
over the grand seal of the brother
hood, to all it.s officers uud members
that he Is "not in position to give uny
definite Information' about the Adam
Bon law "because we do not know yet
Just what the law means." He made
thlH udinisslon In a circular repro
duced herewith addressed to "tho of
ficots ami uiemners of all divisions
and to the chairmen and secretury
treasurers of all general cominitteeH
of adjustment." The circular was
dated at Cleveland. Ohio, Octohcr lo,
llllu. Ji was signed by Mr. Stone a
grand chief engineer and by Assistant
(..rami enters male, wins, uurgess,
Kennedy, CorriKan, Urttflng and
Monfgnmcry.
"We are receiving a number of let
ters requesting definite information
regarding the application of the
Adamson eiKht-hour ilay," says the
circular, "but we are not In positloi.
to give any definite information on
this subject, because we do not know
yet Just what the law means. We are,
however, from time to time furnishing
the general chairmen with such Infor
mation as In obtainable in the mil
tor." Huglicw l'oiiitid out.
The day before Mr. Stone and his
colleagues signed this circular Charles
E. Hughes diHcusseo. the Aduinson law
tn a speech at Newark, N. J. "Haaty
legislation Is likely to carry with It
unwelcome surprises," he said. "If
eight hours is to be a measure 01
stundard of a day's work' for the pur
pose of reckoning the compensation to
be paid, huw are those men left who
complete the prescribed number of
miles in less than eight hours.' Have
they any assurance. If they are to be
paid under this bill on a basis of
hours, that they will be paid on
basis of miles when they work less
than eight hours? And how will
rigid eight-hour basis of pay affect
present guaranties? There is much
food for thought In this legislation,
not only on the part of those roi
whom It does not provide, but also ml
the part of those to whom it expressly
refers."
It Is apparent from tho stntemem
of the circular sent nut by Mr. Stone
and his colleagues that they are he
ginning to do some of the thinkinv
about the Adamson law which Mr.
l?lics suggested thnt thev do In his
Nutnrk speech. And they are find
ing that the law Is not so clear as
It might be. They are beginning it
pay one of the penalties for haste.
But there Is one man who affects
to know Just what tho Adamson law
means, anil Inasmuch as It was his
surrender to the threat of a strlko
by the brotherhoods that drove tho
Mil through congress, ho certainly
ought to know all about It and es
pecially what It meens Ho is Presi
dent Wilson. Time and again since
he signed the bill with four gold pens
and gave one to each brolliornooa
chief as a sacred souvenir he has pro
claimed In public his satisfaction wlti.

High Taxes Will Force a
Change in Tulsa
The exorbitant tax expenditures In
Tulsa county under Democratic ro
glme, amounting to $10.76 per capita
per annum, Is causing u lot of people
to lose some sleep In trying to frumo
up an alibi for the Democratic office
seekers and perpetual officeholders.
Taxpayers far and near are showing u
deep interest In the matter.
The assessed valuation of Tulsa
county Is about 882,000,000. A levy of
4.7 mills for county government means
only the Insignificant sum of J-91.-400.
Then add to this some IL'S.OOU
taken In by the registrar of deeds nnd
$25,000 to $30,000 earned by the
county treasurer for remember that
overy time you pay up the taxes on a
city lot or a ten-acre tract of land
that has been sold for taxvs, and
about half of our realty has been sold
In this matter Judging from the de
linquent tax roll recently published,
you pay $1 to tho county clerk una
also $1 to the county treasurer as fees
and add to these amounts Tulsa
county's share of the Campbell Rus
sell gross production tux, tho automo
bile tax and all other revenues. In
cluding fees from the sheriff's office,
and add the sum to the-$281,400
raised by levy. Divide the grand to
tal by the population of Tulsa county
and you have the figures, $10.78,
which Is the cost to each man, woman
and child for being governed by Dem
ocratic county officers.
This Is on a basis of the population
as given by the federal census of 1910.

A lei inly from all parts of Oklahoma
