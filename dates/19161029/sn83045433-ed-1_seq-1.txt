HIT BY WILSON
Says Hughes Does Not Want
Peace "as Gentlemen
Obtain It."
(By the laternatiemal News Service.)
Shadow Lawn, N. J., Oct. 28.-President
Wilson addressed 10,000 voters here this
afternoon at ajoint celebration of "Wood
low Wilson Day" and "Empire State
Day." He reiterated the charge that the
Republican organization was a party of
vocal and equivocal parts. He aroused
prolonged applause with the charge that
the vocal parts spoke only for themselves.
The equivocal parts, It was declared, were
very necessary in order to make the
statements of the Republican candidate
suit any situation.
The speech delivered by Mr. Wilson
was In no way similar to the advance
matter given out for publication except
In spirit. An appeal was made to the
voters of New York to stand by the Dem
ocratic candidates for office in that State.
Sees Conftion and Futility.
President Wilson said in part:
"The campaign that we are now en
gaged in has reached a point of culmina
tion where perhaps it is possible to view
the field and characterize the results.
Looking at the field as a whole you can
see that all that has been disclosed on
the side of the opposition is confusion
a futility. It is not singular that it
should be so because thy serve under
no single captain, they are moving in no
1:i 'le direction. they have no single body
of principles, they have no single purpose
in mind.
So far as we can diseriminate ele
ments in the opposition there are only
wo main elemenits. Perhaps I may call
them it.- vcal and equivocal. The vocal
- Iement utters very distinct ard emphatic
sentiments. It professes v-ry definite pur
roces. ht s,- soon ;s you question Its au
*hority yo, t'rd that it speaks for no
body hut itcef.
Their p.. is a parley for posses
';on. not a rnley for terms. TIeir parley
is of thos wh, tho'izh they profess to I,
otside, desire to be inside. but for th
t,:.e b-ing th, v ar outside and sieak for
xlhodly but themselves.
"Io Definite Policy."
On the other hand there Is the equivo
Rt element that has to speak for every
body at once and dares not speak for
anybody :n particular. They must speak
in equivocal terms because they must
speak in terms that can be translated
in any way that the exigencies of the
day demand. They put no stamp of
definite policy. They suggest no ine of
d(finite action.
'On the one hand the vocal elements
say that we have accepted the purpose
that they did have in mind. that they
itsire peace but they do not like the way
in whI.h peace was accepted. T'ey pre
fer a peace that is produced by the!
methods cf those who defy, of those who!
hra; of those who threaten. In order
t, es Ch. ir powers th..y 1ave for
!ntten their marnners. They want a peace
inded ,t they do not want a peace
obtain.,d as gentlemen obtain it, hut only
s bra.gai-ts obtain it.
'We hav a peace founded ipon the
delnit.' imlerstanding that the 'nlted
Stats is powerful, self pos-esed and
ha -ni j te ohjects. We have d.'terminedl
whether ie get the respect of th rest
uf t:ie world or not. that we wil d
serve it I th~ wav in which we act.
The people of the 1'nited States are

tonight that America must be prepared
to sacritle everything for patriotic ideals
and declared he did not want "to be
President of 8people that are not ready
to give their all for their 'iberty, their
land, their country that they love."
"If I am elected we shall have an
American administration with no deflec
tion to serve any interest and any ulterior
interest, with no deflection for the pur
pose of bending to the policy of any for
eign power, for the purpose of meeting
any alien machinations of any sort what
ever.
"We propose to have an American ad
ministration that will maintain American
rights on land and sea. With respect of
life there must he with us as with our
fathers a willingness to sacrifice it for
the country that we love.
"There is no hope for a decadent peo
ple. You may pass what laws you please.
you may have what party in power you
please but unless you have that love
of country which preserved us in the
awful struggle fifty years ago, unlexs you
have that patriotic sentiment which will
make you have some of the ideals of
our institutions; of the liberties which
we have gained here. it is idle to talk
about the future of the United States
I do not want to be President of a peo
