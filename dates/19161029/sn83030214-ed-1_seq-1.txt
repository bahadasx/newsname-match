Germans Use New Bomb,
Gas and Maehine Gun
Spirit of the Kaiser's Armies Still Unbroken and Each
Side Believes the End of the War Is
Far Ahead
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER.
[By Cable to The Tribune.]
London, Oct. 28.?In the British base
hospital in France lies a young
wounded German prisoner, who before
the war worked as a forwarding clerk
in Hamburg. He upeaks good English
ar.d wants to go to America aftrr the
w;ir, but he must stay in Hamburg to
support his mother.
Much nearcr the front ia a British
officer who knows more about the Ger?
man army and the internal eonditions
of that cour.try than any man in the
British ?rmy. On . recent trip to the
Western front I talked with both of
these nen and got practically the same
impressions from both concerning Ger
many's military situation.
A piece of shrapnel knocked out the
German at Courcellette. He has lost
the sight of one eye, but the British
surgeons expect to save the other. He
has a trcmendous respect for the
Canadians, having faccd them at Yprcs
and again at Courcellette, whero he
was made a British prisoner. But even
that and the injuries to his eye and
hand had not broken his spirit.
Germany Not Yet Beaten
The British officer was a powerful,
red-faced Scotchman. He talked of
German divisions as if they were chess
men on a board in front of him. He
emphasized the fact that Germany was
not yet beaten "by a long shot." He
seemed to fear that his confidence
would cause an excess of optimism,
a feeling that everything would
soon be over, that there only re
mained the triumphant parade through
London and the rush of sightseers to
tho battlefields. But he impressed me
the aame as the young German
prisoner; he appreciated the fact that
the spirit of the German army was still

and he wanted the world to see the

I talked with a good many Britiah
officers in France, and the higher in
rank they were ihe more they made
me feel that the end was a good way
off. But, unaniinously, they saw only
one ending. I gained the idea that
something in the nature of a decisive
battle was imminent -that everything
so far had been nerely a preliminary.
To meet this larger attack the Ger?
mans are prepared with new instru
ments of warfare. Of these I heard
during my visit.
The development of the maehine gun
during tho war has been a revelation.
Germany has recently put into the field
an instrument th.it commands the re?
spect of all the Allied ordnance offi?
cers because of tbe rapidity of its lire.
There is no doubt that the Germans are
banking heavily on this feature for
future use.
German Bomb Improved
Another recent German lnnovation is
a bemb, the shape and size of an egg>
which has two advantages over the
BritiEh bombs. It outrangea the latter
and a man can carry forty of the
bombs without inconvenience. On the
other hand. its power of destruction ls
much less than that of the British
bomb.
The Germans are now using a special
gas in their attacks which has a nevere
effect on the he.irt, causing death if
the victims attempt any violent excr
cise immediately after inhaling it, but
having no injurious effects if the vic

BLACKLIST LEGAL,
BRITAIN ANSWERS
Refuses to Modify Princi
ple?U. S. Will Send An?
other Note
[From Dt* Tribune Burrau ]
Washington, Oct. 28. Great Britain,
in a note received at the State Depart?
ment to-day, refuses f> modify the
principle under which she claims the
right to blacklist Ameriean firms, but
promises relief to Ameriean firms un
justly Injflfled by its application.
State Department officials refused to
publish the note or discuss it. but it
was learned that it fails to meet the
Ameriean demands, which will be re- ?
iterated in a note to be-sent as soon,
after election as practicable.
The note completes the list of Amer?
iean grievances against the Allies. An
i.nswcr to the blockadc demands was
fld early last summer, and the
mail seizure protests were answer.'!
two weeks ago, both notes rejectingthe
Ameriean position. AlthouKh in every
case the Ameriean government insisted
thflt the Alliea recognize the full neu
tral rights of the United States, no ac?
tion has been taken, and officials say .
none will be until the elections are ;
over.
The Ameriean blacklist protest waa j
sent July 28. It contended that the
Brtish government had no right to i
blacklist. Ameriean firms under any
pretext and demanded a ces"=ation of'
the practice, which was declared to be
"inconsistent with that true justice,1
rincere amity and Impartial fairness
which should chaiacienze the dealing*.
of friendly governments with one an?
other."
The British contention is that the '
blacklist BflflflflflrflB ?re a matter ofcon
cern to Great Britain only. British
firms are forbidden to trade with the
enemy, whether resident in enemy or
BflfltTfll territory, and B Hat of enemy
persons and firms residing in neutral
t'-rntory is publishcd for the guidance
of British trailers.
The point at issue in the controversy
is whether the nationality or the domi
cile of the owner of goods gives chnr
i.i?*' r as neutral or belligerent. I're
viously Great Hritain and tho l.'niterl
States have agreed that domicile was
deciflive, iflflflrdlflflfl of nationality.
The Cflntinflntfll Kuropean position
has been that nationality was decisive.
In the previous negotiations over tflfl

CHIEF'S ATTACK
Blames Washington for
Chaotic Border
Conditions
Mexico City, Mex., Oct, 28.? That the
Villista movement in Chihuahua has
been able to continue because of facil
ities given the enemies of the Consti
tutionalist government in the United
States, was the declaration of General
Carranza in a statement he gave to the
press to-day.
General Carranzi added that his'
government would eventually suppress '
the rebel movement la Chihuaha. He
also denied reports that the Constitu- >
tionalist forces had been defe.ited by j
rebel bands in various sections of
Southern Mexico.
U. S. Border Officials
Supine," Says Cabrera
lafraB Iaa Tii; aaa Baraaa ]
Washinjrton, Oct. tt Hlamc for thfl
present chaotic conditions in Northern j
Me.xico and along the border was placed ;
squarely on the Wilson Administration j
by Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Me\i
BBB Commission to the I'nited .States, j
now conferring with the American com-j
niissinners at Atlantic City, in a i-'ati -
ment made public here to-day.
Following closely on the heels of;
Secretary Baker's charge that for po?
litieal purposes "enemies of the Ad
ministration's policy toward Mexicc" I
were planning an attaek on I'ershing's
column, or a raid over the border. Mr.
Cabrera'8 statement asserts that the ,
"supineness" of the officials of the A i
ministration has permitted large sh'p- |
ments of arms to go to Villa, Zapata
and other bandita, from whom such an
attaek miirht be expected.
Mr. Cabrera further asserts that a
broad interpretation of the imm'.prr.
tion laws, as is the case at Bllfl Islard,
?'would go a long WBJ toward correc -
inj? the border disturbances and allay
much of the unrest which at present
pervades that region."
The Mexican delegate to the peace
conference, it was learned here to
night, was driven to the unusual course
of making a public appeal to the people
of the South, through the press, only
after his vigorous rcpresentations at
the peace conference had been calmly
ignored by Secretary Lane and others j
representing the Administration. It ia J
known that his protests voice the feel-;
inp of Carranza, and virtually the same
protests have been made time and a>rain
to the State Departmer.t by Ambassador
DoaifB*t* Arredondo.
Teit of Cabrera's Statement
Mr. Cabrera's statement follows:
"A broad interpretation of the Fed- ,
eral laws of the I'nited States dealinK j
with neutrality and regulating immi
gration, with a stric', consistent and
efficient administration oi these laws'
by the executives to \ om their admin?
istration is delegated, would go a long
way toward conecting the border dis
turbances and allay much of the unrest
which at present perviuies that region.
"In the I'nited States are many Mexi
SlB* and groups of Mexicans inimical
to the Carranza government Plottingj
and schemings without end are engaged
in, not alone by the extreme conserva

BLOCKED MOVE
Threatened Exposure of
Plan to Scuttle on
U-Boat Issue
[By Te>iTjph to TT.? Trttuafl ]
Somerville, Mass., Oct. 28.?Senator
l.odge, at a Republican rally, to-night
offered proof of his charges that Presi?
dent Wilson had drafted an appendix
to the tirst Lusitania note which nulli
fied its strong words, and that the post
script had been withdrawn when two or
three members of the Cabinet threat?
ened to rcsign.
The proof offered is a conversation
with Henry Breckinridge, former As
sistant Secretary of War, reported to
the Senator by Dr. Charles Hervey Bai- !
Ifljr, a profc-s-iir in Tufts Medical !
School. Boston. The talk took place on
July II last, when Dr. Bailey and Mr.
Breckinridge wero riding on a train
from San Francisco to Omaha. The
Senator read a letter from Dr. Bailey.;
According to the letter, Mr. Breckin?
ridge said that the postscript was kept
a secret from all of the Cabinet except
V.r. Bryan. Mr. Bryan let thfl cat out
flf the bag, and word of it rearhed Mr. '
Garnson. The Secretary of War and
two or three other members of the
Cabinet went to the President and
thlflfltflflfld to rcsign and to make the
matter public if the poi-tscript was not
removed.
Cannot Support Wilson
Mr. Breckinridge, who resigned when
Mr. (iarrison quit the Cabinet, told Dr.
Bailey, according to the letter, that
r.elther he nor any patriotic Ameriean
eould support Wilson, but that he was
a Demoerat at heart and would not
work actively for Hughes.
Senator l.odge pointed out that the
first Lusitania note warned (iermany
that the I'nited Btfltflfl would "omit no
word or act to hold it to strict ac
countability" for Arnerican livea lost
by the torpedoing of merchant ships.
Then he read Dr. BaiUy's letter, which
was flddrflflflfld tfl GlflftflB D. Cushing,
Iflflfl! rhtirman of the Hughi.4 National

CALLS PERSONALLY
FOR AN ANSWER
"Selfish Neutrality" Stirs
Crowd to Cheers in
Brooklyn
Theodore Roosevelt celebrated Wil?
son Day at the Brooklyn Ac-tjflemy of
Music last night. Hfl paid trihute to
the President on the day Bflt aside
for that purpose l?y the Democratic
party with the most hittcr attack
r.gainst his policies and his actions
that he has delivered since he entered
the campaign.
Taking as his text the speech de?
livered in Cincinnati last Thursday
by the Chief Executive, in which Mr.
Wilson declared that the United
States must participate in the next
war, the Colonel delivered a scorch
ing arraignment of the President's
foreign policy. He was sarcastic.
Hfl was hitter. He apostrophized the
present occupant of the Wlnte House
as though he were a prosecuting at?
torney and tho Derrrocratic candidate
were a prisoner seated on the plat?
form with him.
Crowd Yella Approval
As he drove home aceusation after
accusation, the crowd which Jammed
the auditorium to the doora yelled en
couragement. They had begun to yell
when he made his entry at the back of
the atage between two huge banners
emblazoncd with portraita of Hughea.
For minute after minute, while W.
C'ameron Forbes, former Governor Gen?
eral of the Philippines and president
of the Hughes National Alliance,
worked and perspired in an effort to
quiet them, the turmoil continued ao
loud and enthusiastic that it seemed an
echo of the Progreasive Convention at
(,'hicago.
It waa when the Colonel turned and
spoke to the President as though he
stood before him that the climax of
his address came. He branded Mr. Wil?
son as a hypocrite for his talk of future
wars. He mocked at a man who would
talk of his duty in the future "when
throughout your whole term of oftiee
you have failed to do in the present
what you aay is our duty.'
He called to the attention of tha
President, still addressing him pcrsoji
ally, the violation of Belgium's neu?
trality, the rflflflflflflfflfl in Armenia. He
drew to his attention "the outraging
of women, butchering of children and
murder of husbands," and asked the
Chief Kxecutive if he did not regard
these as "an invasion of the funda
mental rights of humanity."
Assails Mexican Policy
The crowd yelled louder and louder
as he built up his case against the
Pr?iflflflt. The;. cheered riercely when
he branded our Mexican policy as weak
and inadequate.
Mr. Forbes, in infroducing thfl
speaker. put the audienc: through .
eatflChiflfll of faith.
"Does any one here believe that the
disaster at Carrizal would have oc
curred," he asked, atepping to the
front of the platform, "if Theodore
Roosevelt had been Preaident?"
"No!" the answer came, like an ex
plosion. and was followed by another
burst of cheenng,
"Does any one believe that the Lnai
tania would have been aunk if Theo?
dore Roosevelt had been President?"
was the next question.
Ihe "No" which came in reply was
t-ven louder and more violent.
Would Ha*e Barred Notea
"And he wouldn't have written any
. me one in the gallery
yelled.
The Colonel was then ir.troduced aa
B man "flrhfl ha> not been too proud to
fight for his country."
Mr. Roosevelt was grinning as hfl
came to the front of the platform. He
was plninly enioying the noiae, and it
inspired him. He sailed into the Presi?
dent with vigor as aoon aa he eould
make hia voice heard above the ap
plause. The grin became broader as
he roused cheer after cheer by his at?
tack. Now and again he paused to let
it ihe away, his teeth shining in the
light and hia eyes narrowed by hia
nghtiflflj aflaslfl.
