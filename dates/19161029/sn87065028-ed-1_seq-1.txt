STARTLING DISCLOSURES
REGARDING BANDIT
OUTRAGES.
SAYS CONSPIRACY
IS BEING HATCHED
Funston and Pershing Fore
warned and Ready to
Resist
y Washington, Oct. 28. Secretary
Baker announces that the war de
partment has received definit? infor
mation that enemies of the govern
ment's policy toward Mexico, in co
operation with Villa or olli.1 brn-
dits, had arranged for a spertacilr
attack on American troops .m '.ho
border to be made before the election
to create sentiment against thi ad
ministration. Full particulars of the plan, the
secretary said, had been fo;'nrded
to Generals Funston and Pci'sbing
and all the American forces are in
readiness for the attack.
Mr. Baker issued this staener.t:
"The war department has re-eixed
definite information, confirmed from
other sources, that enemic? of the
administration's policy toward" Mex
ico, in co-operation with Vil'a or
other bandits in Mexico, havj ar
ranged a spectacular attack to b-;
made either upon some part of th;
American forces or upon some
American community on the border
between now and the date of the
election for the purpose of turning
the tide of sentiment against the
policy which the administration has
adopted for the protection of the
border.
; "It is significant in this connec
tion that both the state, and war de
partments were advised that the
bandit forces operating at the pres.
4-B.t time ors being paid in,
silver coin.
"Full particulars have been trans
mitted to General Funston and Gen
eral Pershing. All American forces
are therefore forewarned and in
readiness for such an attack."
Secretary Lansing authorized the
statement that Secretary Baker had
no intention to intimate that Ameri
can citizens were involved in the ban
dit attack plot. The secretary of
state said it had been called to his
attention that an effort would be
made to construe the war depart
ment's statement as a political play
and as an assault upon the adminis
tration's political opponents. He de
nounced such , a construction as ab
solutely false, declaring that politics
were not given a thought in connec
tion with the matter and that it was
inconceivable that any American
would allay himself with Mexicans
to attack his own countrymen.

SHOTBYS.G.MILLER
ALLEGED GIRL BETRAYER
ATTACKED BY FATHER
IN THE COURT ROOM.
SHOOTING CAUSES
MUCH EXCITEMENT
Ingram Only Slightly Wound
ed, and Citizens Threated to
Finish Job. t
Aberdeen, Miss., Oct. 28. The
entire city is lull or excitement as
a result of G. G. Miller, father of
Miss Mary Miller, th" pretty young
school teacher of Plattsburg, Miss,
who was murdered here several
months ago, shooting Clyde Ingram,
the man, it is alleged, who ruined
his daughter.
Court had just adjourned Thurs
day afternoon when Miller, who had
been in the court room all day, got
up from his seat, walked up onto the
raised platform where the attorneys
sit and where Ingram, Lee and
Broom field were standing, pulled hi.J
pistol and fired at Ingram. The bul
let went through Ingram's arm near
the elbow. The wounded man
dropped to the floor and Miller
pounced on him and snapped his pis
tol three times, Any of thef-e shots
would have killed Ingftam. When
the excitement was over a number
of the spectators had vacated the
court room.
Miller wa.i arrested and placed in
the Monroe county jail by Deputy
Sheriff T. 0. Jones, to remain there
but 30 minutes. Three hundred gen
tlemen rushed to the sheriff and
signed his bond, and there was not
a man that would net have gone on
the bond for his release. Ingram
was looked after by Dr. Lee, and 't
is thought he was spirited away in
an automobile. . .
When interviewed Mr. Miller said
that if he could call buck 10 years
when he was on the plains he would
have "shot the dog through the heart
the first shot." He said that he in
tended killing Ingram first and then
getting Dr. Lee; that he did not want
the negro, Broomfield, as he thought,
he was least guilty of the three.
Miller was very grateful to the
people who rushed to get his release,
and, with tears in his eyes, said that
he felt a little relieved, having tried
to kill the dog that entered his home
and ruined, then murdered his daugh
ter, Mary.
Feeling again has been stirred up
as never before, and talk of forming
a mob and finishing what the father
started is heard on the streets.
Clyde Ingram and Miss Mary Mil
ler taught school together in Wins
ton county, and they attended the A.
& M. Mississippi Normal last sum
mer. It was at this time that
Ingram brought Miss Miller to Aber
deen and placed her in a negro
boarding house which was run by
Sallie Scott. He then, it is charged,
engaged Dr. F. E. Lee to perform
a criminal operation, which resulted
in the young girl's death several day
after the operation, at the home of
Dr. Lee, the girl having been moved
from the negro's house by Dr. Lee.
Dr. Broomfield, a negro doctor, was
called in by Dr. Lee to administer
the anesthetic.
After the girl's death she was
moved to the undertaker's parlors
in the Henderson Hardware Com
pany's building. Mr. Miller, her
father, was wired to come at once,
that his daughter was dead. When
he arrived in Aberdeen he was met
at the train by Clyde Ingram, and
they rode up to the hardware store
together. The father says that he
suspected Ingram all the time, and
would have killed him that night h id
he a pistol to do it with.
Mr. Miller said before he left that
he stood it jut as long as he could,
and that when Judge Clayton an
nounced that the trial would be car
ried to Corinth, he believed that the
three men would be freed, and that
he had better kill Ingram and Lee
and bring the affair to a close.
Citizens of Aberdeen are going to
take up a subscription and employ
the best attorney in Alcorn county
to help select a jury to try the three
accused men.
Home Boys Win Again.
