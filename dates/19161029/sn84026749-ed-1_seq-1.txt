OF
MEXICO PARLEYS
U. S. Officials Believe Abandon
ment of Conferences Will
Follow Statement.
Abandonment of the Mexican media
tion conference at Atlantic City may be
forced, many officials believed today, as
a result of tho statement of Luis Ca
brera assailing the neutrality of tho
United States toward Moxlen, and, In
fcrcntlally, charging the United States
with responsibility for continued law
lessness In that country.
Cabrera Is minister of finance in Car
ranza's cabinet. He also Is president of
the Mexican commission participating In
tho Joint conference at Atlantic City.
Tho statement In which ho was quoted
us making n vigorous attack on the
United States Oovernment was given
out at tho Mexican embassy and
marked "official."
OiTicialH Astonished.
State Department officials expressed
tho greatest astonishment when the
criticisms were called to their atten
tion. They wero Informed later that
Ambnssador-dcslgnato Arrcdonoo had
no knowledge of tho Issuance of the
statement.
It was considered highly probable,
however, the Mexican dlplomate would
bo asked for nn explanation by Secro-
taiy J.HiiHing.
Tho impression was given at the State
Department that had Arrcdomlo, know
lug or tho statement, failed to stop its
publication, ho might have found him
self persona non grata here.
Irrespective of what official action
may bo taken, however, officials made
no attempt to blink the fact that Ca
brera's bitter charges of bad faith by
tho United States, Issued without the
knowledge of the American commis
sioners with whom he was conducting
mediation negotiations, may force ad
Inurnment of the conferences.

IN OPEN BOAT,
MIND A BLANK
Castaway Taken From Gulf of
Mexico Furnishes Another
Strange Coast Story.
MAY BE FROM BALTIMORE
Man Picked Up by Tug Thinks
He's Oyster Shucker Hunt
ing for Friends.
By THEODORE TILLER.
Gl'LFPOHT. Miss.. Oct. 2.-"Tho man
who forgot his name" a castaway found
drifting In an open host in the Gulf of
Mexico has bcen released from custody
here. The wanderer says that some
where along tho aulf Coast he will find
some ono who knows htm.
The man of mystery is the chief ng
ure in a true story as peculiar as any
writer of fiction has er woven about
the sea.
This town Is a port wheie the vessels
of many nations call. Old-fashlonod
sailing vessels, lugs, tramp stcamors,
modern sea carriers, yachts, and row
boats may be seen together along the
piers.
Tho usually tranquil Gulf of Mexico,
delight of tho tourist and the fisherman,
has alt tho romance of the deep, and
not Infrequently brings to shorn some
sailor who would furnish material for
tho author of sea tales.
Such a Character.
Such a character was tho "man who
forgot his name." A few days ago the
tug Uesslo II. D.intzlcr saw an open
boat drifting near tho n'.c selected for
the Mississippi centennial exposition
next year.
A man In the boat seemed to be en
deavoring to throw a lino out to sea.
The tug dreaw near, and its crew finally
reached the conclusion that an Insanu
man was adrift in tho OUlf of Mexico.
Tho man whs taken aboard the tug
lu his boat Im had neither water iior
provisions. Ho was but thinly clad, and
his clothing contained no mark Indi
cating from whom It was purchased,
The castaway said ho did not know
his namo, nor that of tho city from
whence he came.
Remembers Only "Bill."
"Hero's a line. Bill; catch It: here's
tho lino," tho man repeated over and
over again, as they brought him ashore.
He talked Incoherently, except for oc
casional references to "Hill," and for
days no Information whatever could be
obtained from him.
"There's Hill's clothes," he sold, when
he saw a pair of overalls.
City police nfllclals endeavored to as
certain whether he had had n com
panion In tho drifting boat, but this
has never been established.
After several days of mind blankncss
the castaway said:
"I think my name is George Super,
and I left Baltimore. I don't know how
I got here, and I don't know where 1
Intended going."
The unknown admitted dunning be

COAE FAMINE
GROWS ACUTE
E
Unless Relief Comes Quickly
Government, School, and
Apartments Will Suffer.
TWO STEAMERS TIED UP
About One-tenth of Normal
Daily Supply Received by
Dealers Yesterday.
The coal situation in Washington
today reached the most acute stage
of the past few weeks.
Within the next week, it was
admitted by coal dealers today, a
famine may occur which will affect
Government departments, schools,
and the larger apartment houses.
The shortage is most serious in
bituminous coal. This is used in
the large Federal and District
buildings, including the schools.
Today coal companies were 'busy
alloting the limited supply which
came in yesterday, trying to divide
the stock among their contract buy
ers where it was most needed.
SHIPMENTS FALL OFF.
A realization of tho seriousness of th
situation was driven home today upon
purchasing agents and engineers of de
partments when it was learned that
much smaller shipments were received
yesterday than were expected.
One company which furnishes bltumi-
nous coal to the schools, to the DUtri.l
Jail and Washington Asylum nnd t
the Smithsonian Institution, received
only two cht loads of conl yestcrdnv.
The normal receipt would have bee.t
twenty car loads.
This amount wns distributed to tl 1
schools and to the District government,
so that eery branch will have enough
coal to start on tomorrow. ,
Two steamboats plying on the Potomac
and Chesapeake Ba could not leave yeh
terday because of tho shortnee of eo.il.
The hampering of rivor traffic is con
sidered one of the serious plmcs of the
situation the ('unltnl today faces
All tne scnoois win open tomorrow,
though a few will have only enough
coal for a few days. On Friday tho
bins of Central High School showvil
only eight tons, and at the Dunbar
School there was one ton.
Raymond O. Wllmarlh was In his
ofllce at the Franklin School today
working out a plan by which coal
already stored In schools may be re
distributed if occasion demands.
Yesterday coal sufficient for n fev
days was hauled to Central High ami
the Dunbar Schools, as well as to the
M street heating plant, which sup
plies heat for the old M Street Hlfth
Schpol and for several grade school
Householder Suffers Little.
The fact that bituminous coal is
chiefly affected furnishes a ray of com
-. .. . .- . j ... - .
fort for the small householder. Theie
has bcen no shutting off. It was stated,
on small orders of anthracite coal.
The company which furnishes the
District government and the schools
with coal has plenty at tho mines, tlio
president of tho company said today
But enough cars to carry It cannot be
obtained.
An official of the compiny which
supplies the Tieasury nnd the Agricul
tural departments stated today that
enough coal was on hand for a few
days, but there wns no assurance that
the supply would be, forthcoming for
the rest of tho week.
' Dealers Offer No Remedy.
Coal dealers now state that so far as
bituminous coal Is concerned, they can
promise nothing. With shipments grow
ing smaller nnd smaller tho problem of
dividing the coal that comes In nmong
tho buildings that need It most Is an
increasingly difficult one.
It Is probable that if the stringency
continues until the end nf tho week the
Government departments having con
tracts with tho same dealers, may get
together and woik up on a plan of rc
dlstlbution. Tlio coal producers do not look for
materlnl teller as a lesult of the In
quiry launched yesterday by the Intel -state
Commerce Commission..
Due to Car S'nrtage.
The coal stringency, they say, Is duo
almost entirely to a shortage of cars,
and this shortage, they add, cannot be
cured by an investigation or orders of
tho Intorstatc Commerce Commission.
The railroads have not n sufficient num
ber of cars to accommodato tho heavy
traffic now being hauled, and, while
much new equipment has been ordered,
tho now cars cannot be delivered.
Statisticians figure that to koyu
equipment abreast of business the rail
roads of the country should build at
least 200,000 cars a year. During 1014
and 1915 only a small percentage of this
number wero built.
Tho Philadelphia and Beading Coal
nnd Iron Compuny which supplies a
large portion nf tho nnthraclto coal
used In tho DUtrlct :s keeping Its
dealers running by apportioning the
coal as It comes In dally from tha
mines. Other companies aro pursulnr
a similar course.
Patience Is Counseled.
Dealers Insist that there Is no dan
ger of ft coal famine, but add that tho
public must bo patient. Many ous
tomers, they say. fearing that thora
will bo a serious shortage, are now
ordering more coal than ever beforo.
