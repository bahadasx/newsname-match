Chicago, Oet. 28. Oarry Herr

with Han Johnson here today. After
three days, the suspicion that Herr
mann Is patching up the row between
Johnson and President Toner over
the McQraw Incident Just previous to

Herrmann and Johnson are sphinx
like on the subject, but It Is signifi
cant that linn Is toning down his re

baseball," he explains.
It Is snld Herrmann Is also trying
to forestall 'the tight Harney Drey
fuss Is making to dissolve the present

seeking Johnson's aid In his fight.
It Is possible that Herrmann will

Hughes Advises That There
Can Be Neither Peace Nor
Security Without Mainten-
ance of Self Respect
Newark. X. Y.. Oct. 28. "We shall
have no peace nor security unless we
maintain our self-respect," Nominee
Hugties told an audience that packed
Into the opera house here today.
' Hughes' hearers had come miles
from the surrounding country and
had waited an hour or more in the
theater.
The candidate reiterated his pre
vious views on Americanism, the tar
iff and democratic prosperity argu
ments. His voice was very frayed.
"Some time," he said, "the Amer
ican community and particularly
those who are Interested in agricul
ture will awake to the necessity of
a buslneas-like administration so
that In expanding activities of gov
ernment we shall not be overwhelm
ed by the burden of taxation. There
la no prosperltyfor the United States
If we go about our great International
business In han-haxard fashion."
The democrats, Hughes declared,
have betrayed the people of the merit
system and their performances have
not matched up. with their promises.
They promised to reduce the coat of
living, but on the contrary Inaugur
ated a policy greatly reducing the
chances of making a living.
The schedule for the presidential
campaign apeclal today carried
Hughes northward through New
York. He was due for speeches here,
nt Oswego, Watertown, and at night
at Ogdensburg. Tonight he will rest
In Ogdensburg. remaining over there
until late Sunday afternoon, when
he starta for Ohio.

heart. The nRht he died, he said,
'Son, your father la golug rub my

"The night after his burial 1 climb

grave with my fists. I was only a
boy. Mother's heart was always
broken, and the night wind blew so,
she died sobbing.
"1 swore when 1 grew to be a man
1 would be different. That was 40
years ago. Rut I broke a sweet girl's
heart and my own son disowned me
death lias no sting, but when I'm
gone I know I'll be listening for the
