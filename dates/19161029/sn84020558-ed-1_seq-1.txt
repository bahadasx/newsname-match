here tonight that if he were elected

he with us as with our fathers," he
added, "a willingness to sacrifice for
the country that we love."
Earlier In the day. he had asserted

discussion of the enactment of tire
Adamson law. In his speech here to
night Mr. Hughes, after declaring
that "it is love of country, not love of
dollars, that will make America great,''
he said.
"We want material advancement.
We want to have the greatest prosper
ity we can achieve, but it is a mis
take to suppose that with nations as
with men, great development and suc
cess can be attained if there are low
and unworthy ideals which dominate
action. It 1b the lofty patriotic ideal
that must beckon us on. and to which
we must be faithful. We must have
a driving power in this country, a
power which engendered a dominant
sense of unity and a respect lor the
provisions of American citizenship.
"'If I am elected, we shall have an
American administration with no de
flection to serve any ulterior Interests
and with no deflection for the pur
pose of bending to the policy of any
foreign power for the purpose of meet
ing any foreign machinations of any
sort whatever. What we hope is to
have an American administration four
square to the world, maintaining
American rights on land and sea with
respect to life, property and commerce.
I tiere must be wun us as with our

There is no hope for a decadent

have that love of country which pre
served us in the awful struggle fifty

United States secret operatives from
San Francisco brought Wilken here
and seized the outfit after his alleged
confession that he made and passed
more than $,"ii),000 of spurious paper in
seven years.
The plant, a copper etching uiitfit

in a room three blocks from police

SOMERVILLE, Mass., Oct. 28. The
assertion that President Wilson at the
time the second Lusitania note was
sent to Germany, wrote and afterward
withdrew a postscript informing the
German government that the contents
of his previous note were not to be in
terpreted too seriously, was reite-rateei
by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge in a
political address here tonight. The
senator added to his statement the an
nouncement that information on the
subject had come to him in a letter
from Dr. Charles H. Bailey, of the
Tufts Medical school, in which Henry
H reck en ridge, formerly assistant sec
retary of war was quoted as authority
for the story of the alleged postscript.
Senator Lodge reviewed the sending
of the Lusitania notes and the resig-
nation of Secretary of State Bryan. Ho
continued: "There was one feature
about which there was much specula
tion at the time, and that was why
Mr. liryan allowed his name to be ap
pended to a very strong note couched
in the most extreme language possible
to diplomacy, and yet resigned so that
he need not affix his signature to the
very mild note of June H, a note which
even a man of very strone pacificist
tendencies could not have objected to.
It was currently reported at the time
that the reason for this apparently in
explicable action on Mr. Bryan's part
was the fact that the first note as
finally sent was not the note to which
he had appended his signature.
Within a few days there has come
into my possession direct information
upod 'his subject, contained in the fol
lowing letter which was addressed to
Grafton Gushing who forwarded it to
me. This writer. Dr. Charles H. Bai
ley, professor in the Tufts Medical
school, is a gentleman of high stand
ing anf" undoubted veracity."
Sen&tor Lodee then read the letter
of Dr. Baik-y, dated October 21. as fol
lows: "Dear Sir: As you requested. I am
submitting to you herewith in writing
a repot t of a conversation between Kx-
Assis'.ant Secretary Breckenridge and
j myself.
Leaving San Krannisco n
July i5, 1J16. I rode from that citv
as far as Omaha, Nebraska, with Mr.
Breci;enrid::e. During the trip I asked
him if he would le willing to answer
certain questions with regard to the
com. i Jt of our national affairs during
his connection with the present tdrr.in
istration. Receiving an affirmative
reply, I asked him among other thing's
as to the truth of the published report
that, following the so-called "strict
accountability" note Secretary Br an
had informed Ambassador Dumha that
the central powers need not take the
note loo seriously, as it was written
for political effec' and home consump
tion only. He said that in all essential
details I had stated the matter cor
rectly, which led him of his own ac
cord to tell me ;he follow ing this is
not, of course, a verbal import, but
Kimi ly a brief outhre of the story by
Mr. Brec kenridge:
"'He stated that following the com
pletion of the 'omit no word or no an'
not to the satisfaction of the cabinet.
Mr. Wilson without the knowledge of
any member of the cabinet, except
Secre.ary Bryan himself wrote x post
script vhich he sent with the note to
thj stale department fir codification.
Mr. Urcckenriiiire stated that both Mr.
Garrison and he had seen thus post
script and he told me what he chunicd
were its exact wordr, which, he wever.
I CE.nnot repeat exactly, hut the sub
stance was that the imperial German
government was not to put too serious
an interpretation on the words; 'omit
no word or act' on the contrary ho
would be inclined, provided the Ger
man government did not see fit to
yie'd to the demands of the United
States to use his efforts toward sub
mitting; the entire matter to an impar
tial international tribunal, the decision
to he made only after the war." '
Ro,h note and postscript was sub
mitted to and signed by Secretary
Bryan. This, according to Mr. Breck
enridge was too good for Mr. Bryan .
to keep to himself with the result that
it reached Secretary Garrison's ears,
who immediately with two or three. I
do not remember which, other mem
bers of the cabinet, called upon Mr.
Wilson and demanded that he with
draw the postscript under the threat
that otherwise they would resign and
make the matter public. Mr. Wilson

carry on his business of commercial
artist, according to the authorities.
Wilken's process for making the pa
per on which the bills were printed, it
was said, consisted of boiling bits of
linen bark into a pulp and by hand,
working into the texture the silken
threads characteristic of genuine pa
per money. He also demonstrated to
the authorities his methods of making
the photo-engravings and his mixture
of the inks which marked his work as
the closest approach to the genuine
ever seen.
Wilken has a mother dependent on
him in New Y'ork City, he said, and
the authorities ascertained that he has
regularly sent funds to her. He is
years old.
