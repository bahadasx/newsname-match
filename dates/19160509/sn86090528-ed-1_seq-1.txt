(United Press Staff Correspondent.!
London, May 9. The war has de
veloped the "hursaa falcon."
Aerial fighters and aeronautical ew
perts throughout Europe today ar
discussing Germany's waper-hawk
Lieutenant Immelmann.
Advices just received in England)
from the vicinity of Lille, France, and
from Germany, tell for the first timei
the falconish methods ot the chann
plon Teutonic Fokker Flyer, wtiocqj
total bag to date is officially 'am
nounced at fifteen allied aeroplanes.
Immelmann's secret of offensive alt(
fighting is extremely 'simple. He
sights his quarry an allied aeroplane?
bent on reconnalsance duty or aeriaj
photography, somewhere over thai
German lines near Lille- The Falcon!
leaves the ground and! wings to si
great height, an altitude of 13,OOOJ
feet or more. '
When he has manouvered over his
adversary, he sets his planea and!
makes one long, terrific, downward
swoop. The plan is to pass diagonally,
behind his opponent at the rate of,
perhaps 200 miles an hour. Hia ma
chine gun is primed and ready. When!
he enters a prescribed area the but
lets begin to fly.
Just like tho falcon, the membet)
of the hawk family which tries onca
and Btrikes its mark or misses, Im
melman either bags his "bird" at ona,
swoop or wings back to his aerodomej
a failure He never returns to the;
attack. He empties one drum of bul
lets and, hit or miss, continues hl4
dive until It takes him home.
In Germany Immelmann is a nat
ional hero. He is called "The Eagle;
of Lille."
More graphic details of Immel-i
mann's method of attack ar con
tained in a letter just received ia
London from Lieutenant R. J. Slade.
of the British Flying Service.
Slade is one of the German Falcon's!
fifteen victims and now a prisoner a
Furstenberg.
Slade and his pilot, Captain Darley
Royal Flying Corps, were on recon
naissance duty over the German lineij
near Lille. The Falcon saw them.
"Suddenly from somewhere out ot
the air. Immelmann swooped down
behind us," declared the British of-'
ficer. "He opened fire with his ma
chine gun before we were aware ot
his presence."
The stream of lead from the Fokker
riddled the Briton's petrol tank. Cap
tain Darley, In charge of the controls,
tried to escape by a sudden nose dlvej
The Falcon followed with accuracy,
A steady stream of lead found its
mark. Captain Darley was shot
through the right arm. while tha
thumb of his right hand was reduced
to a pulp.
In midair, thousands ot feet abov
'he earth, the letter explains, Slade
was forced to lean over and amputate
Iterley's shattered thumb , with hie
penknife, lt was an easy operation,
as only skin and shredded fish helit
the member.
Throughout that time the German
aviator continued his steady fire.
Slade's clothing was riddled with lead!
but ho miraculosly escaped. Th
pilot was again wounded in the left
hand, but with his injured right arm
he manouvered his machine toward,
earth and made a perilous landing.
