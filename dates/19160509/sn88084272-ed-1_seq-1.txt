Negotiations With Another Nation; Acceptance

WAbHINGTON, D C. Mat 9
America's latest note to Ger
many on the submarine contro
versy has gone forward to Berlin to
day and administration officials were
interested in knowing whether Ger
many would make any rtpl The text
of the note shows the United States
accepts the German promises that sub
marine warfare in the future will con
form with rules of international law.
It insists however, that Germany must
not consider her respect for rights of
American citizens on the high seas
contingent upon the conduct of any
other belligerent with whom the
United States may be negotiating
"Responsibility in such matters is
single, not joint; absolute not rela
tite." says the note
Secretary Lansing gate out a state
ment explaining that a large part of
the latest German reply dealt with
questions concerning the conduct of
other belligerents which the American
goternment could not discuss with the
Berlin government He stated, how
ever he considered German had
'tielded to our representations" and
'we can hate no reason to quarrel
with her." so long as the altered sub
marine policy is noc violated
