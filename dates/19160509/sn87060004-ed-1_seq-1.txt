Cocktails
f The old way of doing buiness
was to take a prospective pur
chaser, especially' if be were
from the country, and ".how him
the town." Salesmen of the
leading business houses had an
unlimited expense account for
such use, for this' was the ac
cepted method of landing a big
order. Standards have risen in
recent years and the best coo-
corns wonld frown upon the sale
' man who had to take customer?
to tho red light, district, the low
class theatre, the saloon, or the
card table to get an order.
There are some houses, however,
that still encourage their em
ployees to follow this lower
standard of buiness morality
and eflloienoy.
A still more roraarkible situs
tion is disclosed in the plea nf
"guilty" made by the high
salaried sales manager, named
White, of a Naw York compaux
to the charge of robbing two
messengers of his company of
the payroll $8,000. His dowc
fall he lays to cocktails taken
with his employer at luncheon,
this leading on to nights of
drnnken gayety with other com
panions, finally transforming a
eobor business man into a crook.
His attorney, commenting upon
his (.'ovnfall, said: "It was the
case of a nun who had to go to
Manhattan and the Tenderloii
and drink wine and spend money
" to hold his position. White hie
to do this to get business, anri
his advanoemeut was due to thf
fact that for years he mado n
habit of it. He finally got to
going there for his own pleasure
aud fell in with bad company..
It is the old ftory nf a goad man
being dragged down by bad
men."
The employee who take hi
sales manager out to luncheon
and fills him with cocktails and
wiue so that he it adhamed in lit"
halfdrunkon coudition to go back
to tho office, need'nt be 6urpried
if his trusted employee, under
the influeu.ee of drink, he roye
