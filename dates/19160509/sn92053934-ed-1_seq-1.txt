CRISIS IS ADMITTED
Confessing Gravity of Sit
uation Officials Hope
to Avoid Split.
Washington, May 9. Special
Agent Itodgers at Mexico City, to
day telegraphed the state depart
ment that General Carranza had
indicated his approval of the ten
tative border protocol which has
practically been concluded by
General Scott and General Obre
gon. El Paso, Tex, May 9. A criti-
cal stage apparently had developed
today in the conference between
Generals Obregon, Scott and Fun
ston, over troops cooperating in
Mexico. That the point has not
been reached and in fact, may not
be reached, where the negotiations
will end in a disagreement, how
ever, was indicated from an .an
thoritative sonrce.
General Obregon said there was
no truth in reports he had de
manded the withdrawal of the
American troops
"If 1 spent my time denying all
the inventions nf the yellow
press," he added, "I would have
no time left for anything else."
It was said the Mexican conferee
has asked for another conference with
the American representatives. From
Juarez came the information that Gen
eral Obregon thought the negotiations
might keep him here another two or
three days
While the gravity of the situation is
admitted, it is thought that in the next
meeting or meetings to be held steps
to avoid a split will be taken. War
talk was prevalent along the border
today but the more conservative point
er! out that even if hostilities should
ensue they would come only after some
delay. It was also pointed out that if
the conferences ended without any
agreement being signed, exchanges be
tween Washington officials and Gen
eral Carranza necessarily would fol
low.
This opinion, of course, was predict
ed upon the supposition that no overt
act against the American expeditionary
force would be committed.
Obregon Shifts Blame.
General Obregon is not held respons
ible for the phase of the negotiations
now reached. He is said to have fa
vored an early conclusion of the nego
tiations along the line indicated by the
United States.

Berlin, May 9. (via London, 3 7
p. m.) The capture of several
French trenches on the Verdun
front south of Hauconrt was an
nounced by the war office today.
Paris, May 9, (12:15 p. m.) After a
violent bombardment1 of the lYench
positions on Hill 304 on the Verdun
front, the Germans attempted an ad
vance at 3 o'clock this morning. The
war office announces this afternoon
that the attack was repulsed complete
ly. Ftench counter attacks east of
the Meusc drove the Germans from
certain positions they had captured.
The positions recaptured by the
French consisted of some parts of
trenches northwest of Thiaumont.
An intense bombardment was con
ducted by the Germans in the sectors
of Aix and Chatillon and between Dou
amont and Vaux.
There was grena-o fighting at Apre
mont and in the valley of the Fecht.
South of Autreches near Soissons, the
Germans attempted an attack but were
repulsed.
At Bolante, in the Argonne, the
French captured two small German
posts, killing all the occupants.
Elsewhere on the front there were
no important developments.
French Are Efficient.
The latest assaults of the Germans
on the defenses of Verdun have served
to demonstrate the high pitch of ef
ficiency to which the French have
brought the use of the machine gun.
The French front line trenches are be
ing defended by machine guns with
comparatively few men to serve them
and with the addition of new auto
matic rifles, two of which are equiv
alent to one machine gun.
The forty-eight hour preliminary
bombardment of the Germans is de
scribed by eye witnesses as more se
vere than anything which hitherto has
been experienced and it is remarked
that the Germans were justified in be
lieving no human being could have
lived in the zone subjected to this
bombardment. Nevertheless the French
are such adepts at constructing un
derground shelter that when the Ger
man infantry stepped from the
trenches scores of well placed machine
guns opened concentrated fire, thin
ing the ranks of the attackers before
the advance was fairly begun. French
officera state that the losses of the
Germans in proportion to the number
engaged were as great as 1n any other
action of the war.

TROOPS SUMMONED BY THE
PRESIDENT WILL BE SENT
TO GUARD MEXICAN BORDER
Border Raids
Laid to Foes
of Carranza
Washington, May 9. After an early
conference with Secretary Lansing to
day Eliseo Arredondo, General Car
ranza's ambassador, said he had told
the secretary "there is not an iota of
truth" in reports from the border that
General Obregon had demanded the
withdrawal of American troops. The
ambassador denied also that Mexican
troops had been disposed during the
El Paso conference so as to threaten
General Pershing's line of communica
tion. Mr. Arredondo asked that increased
vigilance be kept by the American bor
der patrols against attacks by the ene
mies of General Carranza, who were
trying to force them into war by bor
der raids.
. "The de facto government," Mr. Ar
redondo said, "has official and accu
rate information that the attack on
Glenn Springs was organized in the
United States. It is feared that other
similar movements might occur. I
have laid our information before Sec
retary Lansing. We have accurate in
formation of at least two separate
places on the border, where raids are
now being planned by these interests."
Mr. Arredondo declared Antonio Vil
Iareal was the principal instigator of
the Glenn Springs raid, according to
his information. Villareal recently
visited Neuvo Laredo, he said, in an
effort to foment a mutiny in the Car
ranza garrison. The ambassador de
scribed the object of these factionists
as being in accord with the Magon pro
paganda in Mexico, which he said was
a radical organization with which Vil
lareal had been affiliated 20 years.
Secretary Lansing promised to dis
cuss that feature with Secretary
Baker. Before the conference at the
state department had concluded, how
ever, Secretary Baker had announced
the president's decision to send the ad
ditional troops to General Fnnston.
Mr. Arredondo was informed of these
orders.
"I am glad to hear that," he said.
"It is exactly what is needed."
A message from General Scott at El
Paso reached the war department early
today and Secretary Baker sent a re
ply immediately. The contents of
neither dispatch was disclosed.

Soldiers of Texas, Arizona,,
and New Mexico to Re
spond to Order.
AFFECTS 7,000 MEN!
Militiamen of States and
Three Regiments of
Infantry to Go.
Washington, May 9. ,
President Wilson has called:
out the militia of Texas, Ari
zona and New Mexico to deal
with the border situation.
Secretary Baker today issued
the following statement regarding
the use of the militia:
"The outbreak in the Big Bend
district of the Rio Grande has so
far further emphasized the danger
of similar occurrences along our
long border that the president has
called out the militia of Arizona,
ew Mexico and Texas and direct
ed them to report to General Fan;
ston, who will assign them to sta
tions along the border for patrol
duty.
"In addition to that, three addi
tional regiments of regular infan
try have been directed to proceed
to the border and such further ar
rangements will be made as are
necessary for the complete secur
ity of the people of the Tnitod
States against raids of this char
acter.'" Secretary Baker said the militia of
the three border states would make
available about 4,000 men.
In addition three regiments of regn-i
lar infantry were today ordered to the'
border. These regiments were the 30tfy
infantry now at Plattsburgh, N.
the 21st infantry at Vancouver barn
racks and two battalions of the 14Vxi
infantry at Fort Lawton, near Seattle,!
Wash., and one at Spokane, Wash.
The total additional force sent too
the border under these orders includ-
ing both regulars and militia is ap-i
proximately seven thousand men.
Secretary Baker announced alsothat?
published reports that the raid uponi
Glenn Springs had been organized oitj
the American side of the line, accord-!
ing to Mexican reports, had been tele-,
graphed to General Funston that hei
might investigate.
No Significance in Move.
Secretary Baker said the orders
sending more troops to the border,
were made upon the joint resolution of i
General Scott and Funston and werej
without significance in connection with i
the Scott -Obregon conferences. Re-i
garding the progress of these confer-;
ences, Secretary Baker said General '
Scott was awaiting a communication ,
from General Obregon. Further than.
this the secretary refused to discuss i
the status of the conferences.
Generals Scott and Funston advised
the war department that more troops
were urgently needed along the
border, as a return of the Big Bend .
raiders might be expected. They stat-'
ed that the regulars on patrol duty,
with the bulk of the southern forces
within Mexico, were insufficient to
adequately guard against repetition of
the Big Bend raid. It was upon these
recommendations, the president and
Secretary Baker decided to call into
service the national guard of the three
border states.
Only to Protect Border.
Secretary Baker described the new
troop movement as a step merely for
protection of the border. He said ho
had not heard whether the American
troops in the Big Bend region had act
ually crossed the boundary in pursuit
of the outlaws who raided Glenn
Springs and Boquillas.
Funston to Hurry lo Headquarters.
Kl Paso, Texas, May 9. On receipt
of news that President Wilson had or
dered out the Texas, New Mexico and
Arizona militia. General Funston an
nounced today that he would return to
his headquarters at San Antonio just
as soon as he could arrange to do so.
His departure will be contingent upon
arrangements he can make with Gen
eral Scott relieving him from partici
pation in the conference with General
Obregon.
So Demand for Withdrawal.
Secretary Baker has not been ad
vised whether a new expedition haa
crossed the border in pursuit of the
raiders, but orders have not been
changed and General Funston is free
to follow any hot trail across the line.
No further word has come to clear
up the border conference but officials
said no demand has been made for th
immediate withdrawal of American
forces.
The conference situation was fur
ther complicated by official advices
from Mexico City saving General Car
ranza had agreed to the proctocoL
Troops to Stay.
It was made plain here that the ex
pedition will remain in Mexico until
the Carranza government has
proven its ability to check brigand
and guarantee the security of Ameri
can border towns.
