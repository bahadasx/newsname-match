waa the flrfll* to open for the defence.
Me began by ndiculing the govern

munitions to the Allies. He pointed
out that the evidence showed that Fay
and his asiociates on trial were prac
tically penniless at the time of their
arrest, thus making expensive plots
such as theirs was out of the ques?
tion.
He said the .ruv of the case h-.nged
on obtaimng "TNT" as trinitrotoluol

that Fay. instead of wanting this pow

it be not received. It was finally
planted on him by Tanl Seibs, the gov?

Text of President's Reply to Germany.
Waahinrjton, Maji 8. FoUotamg is Ihr tr.rt nf thr note rnhlrd tn-dmi
f>u Secretary Lan*inri to Ambammador Gerard nt Berlin, uith instrurtinm tn
drlivrr it tn thr German Ministrr nf Foreign Affairs:
Thr note of thr Imperial German Government under ilatr of May 4,
1916, Iias reecived careful considrration hy thc Govrrnmrnt of thf I'nited
St.-itcs. It is csprcially noted. as indicating thr purposc of thr Imprrial Gor
.rnment a.s to thr future. that it "is prepared to do its utinost to eonfinr thr
opcration of thr war for thr rrst of its duration to the tighting forres of the
belligTcnts" and that it is detennined to impose upon all its eommandrrs at
sea thc limitations of thr rrcognized rnlrs of intrrnational law upon which
thr Government of thr I'nited States has insisted.
Throughout the months which have elapsed sinre the Imperial Gov?
ernment announeed. on Frbruary 4. 1915, its suhmarine policy. now happily
ahandoncd, the Govrrnmrnt of thr Tnitrd Statea has been ronstantly guidrd
and rrstrainrd hy motivrs of frirndship in its patirnt rfforts to bring to an
amicable srttlrmrnt thr rritiral qurstions arising from that poliry. Arrrpt
ing the Imperial Govrrnment's declaration of its ahandonment of the policy
whieh has so serioiisly menaeed the good rclations between the two eountries, the
Government of the United States will rrly upon a srrupulons rxrrution henee*
forth of thr now altrrrd policy of thr Imprrial Government surh as wil' re
move the principal danger to an interrnption of the good relations existing
between the I'nited States and Germany.
Tlie Government of the United States feels it necessary to state that it
takes it for granted that thc Imprrial German Govrrnment does not intend
to imply that the maintenanee of its neuly announeed policy is in any way
contingent upon the course or result of diplomatie negotiations between the
Government of the I'nited States and any other belligerent govenunents,
rvo^withstanding thc fact that certain passages in thc Imperial Gtovemment'l
note of the fourth instant might appear to bc susceptible of tbat eonstrnction.
In order. however, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, tbe Govern
ment of the I'nited States notifies the Imperial Government tbat it cannot for
a moment entertain. much less discuss, a suggestion that respect by German
naval authorities for .tbe rights of eitizens of the T'nited States upon the high
seas should in any way or in tbe slightest degree be made contingent upon tbe
conduct of any othrr government affrrting thr rights of nentrals and non-com
batants. Hesponsibility in such matters is single. not joint; absolute. not
relative.
Army of 250,000 Not
Too Big, Says Wilson
President Declares Weak Nation
Cannot Help To Make
Peace Durable
Washington. May l Hope that at
the end of the preaent war the na
tions of the world would undertak
a jo.nt effort to keep the peace. backed
bv a common police 'orce, was ?x
presied by President Wilson to-day ia
an interview with a committee of the
American I'mon against militar.sm.
the members of whieh ealled to pro
teit against his preparedncss pro
I gramme and advue him that they
had found a fear of militansm in the,
j country west of the Alieghanies.
The President declared that there
I was "nothir.g rxtravagant" ia a SSS
posal for an army of 250.000 men for
-he I'nited States.
The President told h a ca'.iers that a
Ihelpless nation would be neghgible in
a conference to establish the founda
! tions for peace. He said there was a
j difference between preparedness and
1 militansm; that the eountry was in no
: danger of the latter, and. la response
to a question. daclared that compu!-;
j iory miliury training was not eontrary
I to American traditions.
JUv Wtle4?n Ib Mialed.
The eoraraittee insisted that, on ac?
count of hn office, the Prendlnt most
frequently addressed audienees from
the upper classes, and that tha re
tponses he received on the proposal to
inerease the military forces were mis
leading tiim flfl to the true sentiment
of the country.
The committee was headed bv Miflfl
Lillian D. Wild, Rabbi Stephen S, Wiflfl
and Amos R. F. Pinchot. of Vew York
City; A. A. Berle, of Cambridge.. Mass .
and John A. McSparran, legislative
chairman of the National Grange, who
presented a memonal settmg forth
that while the union did not ?tand
against sane or reasonable prepared
ne?s nor for peace at anv price, it was
convinced that the big army and navy
programmes were a menace to democ
rary. The President was informed that
that these views had been exprtssed in
great meetmgs in tan cities of the
Middle West and had met with enthu
siastic indorsement.
When the spokesmen of the delega^
tion had supplemented their memonal
bv brief speeches the President replied
and for an hour listened to and an
bwered their questions.
Ameriea Not Militariatir.
"I have never dreamed for a moment
that Ameriea. as a whole. its rank and
tile, had got any military enthusiaam
or militanstic spirit." said the Presi
uent. "and I think that it is very
necessary, 1:1 order that we should
work this thing out wisely. that we
should earefully discnminate betwee:
reasonable preparstion and militansm,
because, if you use the two words in
terchangeably, then, of course, thc

take on a wrong and sinister appea

the 'wTong things, when we are 1

unavoidable in the circumstances.
"I think it would be a disservice not
to recognize that there is a point of
reasonable preparation, and that you
can go to that point without chang.ng
the spirit o'.the country or vio.ating
its traditions. For the .raditions of tne
