GERMAN8 STYLE THEIR HERO "THE EAGLE OF LILLE" FOR
HIS MARVELOU8 FIGHTING FOR KAISER AND COUNTRY FAR
ABOVE THE EARTH
By WILBUR S. FORRE8T
(Unltod Press Staff Correspondent)
LONDON, May 9. Tho war has de
veloped tho "human falcon."
Aorlal tighten nnd aoronautlcal ex
perts throughout Europe today aro dis
cussing Germany's supor-hawk, Lieu
tenant Immolmanri. Advices Just re
ceived In England from tho vicinity of
Lille, Fiance, und from Germany, tell
for the first tlmo of tho falconlsh
methods of tho champion Teutonlo
Fokkor Flyer, whose total bag to date
la officially announced ub fifteen allied
aeroplanes.
Inunolmann's secret of offensive air
flchitnc is extremeny simple. He
sights his quarry, an allied aoroplano
bent on reconnaissance duty or aenai
photography, somewhere over the Gen
man lines near uue. oe
leavoB the ground and wings (io a
great height, an altitude of 13,000 or

beginning of the war. This great gun
throws n shell of forty centimetres, or
15.7 Inches. If the French armies ever
reach the German border forts the
gun will be used to batter them to bits.
c
mes tic commerce show the heaviest
month was March' last, when more
than $50,000,000 worth of munitions
left American ports. April totals havo
not been compiled. -
This Young
"the Human Falcon"
enters a. prescribed, area the bullots
begin to fly.
Just like the falcon, that member of
tho hawk family which tries once and
strikes its mark or misses, Immolmahn
either bags his "bird" at one swoop or
wings back to his aerodrome a failure.
He never returns to the attack. He
empties ono drum of bullets, nnd hit or
miss, continues his dive until it takes
him home. v
In Germany Immelmann is a na
tional hero. He is called the "Eagle
of Lille."
Moro graphic dotalla of Inunolmann's
method of attack are contained in a
letter Just received In London from
Lieutenant R. J. Slade of the' British
flying service. Slade is one of the Ger
man Falcon's fifteen victims, and la
now a prisoner at Furatenberg. 81ade
and his pilot, Captain Darley, royal fly
ing corps, were on reconnalnaaott
duty over the German lines near Lille.
Tho Falcon saw them.
"Suddenly from somewhere out of
the air Immelmann swooped down be
hind us," declared the British oSJctr.
"Ho opened fire wltb his machine gun
before we, were aware of bis' pret
ence."
The stream of lead from tht Fokker
riddled the Briton's patrol task. Ca
