quired the Sheriff.
"Working," replied Shiflet. "You
won't want me, do youT
"Yes, I think I do. You haven't got
a gun, halve you?"
"No."

The building of roads by convicts
was given a trial last year when the
road from Chester to Waupun was
constructed by prison labor. This is
the first time counties have tried the
plan. Not many convicts will be leas
ed to the counties this year owing to
the fact that about 175 prisoners are
being employed in state construction

feeble minded at Union Grove and at

The descent of the Russians west

:To

been easier and the Turks south of
Bitlis are being driven from a series
of fortified positions, hotly pursued
by oosmcks, who have proved them
selves master at the sport of war so

Thus both the Turkish flanks—that
