WASHINGTON. May 9 The Am
erican conaul at Liverpool wired today
that the crew ol the Cymric had been
landed at Bantry. Despite the alate
raent of Conaul Frost at Queenstown,
that some sailors were loat, Liverpool
Insisted that all were saved.
The report thut the Cymric was In
the service of the British admiralty
complicated the situation. White Star
officers denied this. If true, the
steamer will have to be classed as a
warship and America will not be con.
earned In the attack.
Consul Frost huts left queensiown
for Bantry to learn whether the Cym
ric had been warned, He will inter-'
view the officers. The fact that the
Cymric was allowed to leave Newj
York Indicated It was not engaged In,
un-neutral business and therefore notj
a warship.
It was believed that Germany's new
submarine policy would be tested In
the Cymric caae. If there was nu
warning the attack apparently violate
Germany's orders. The fact that there
mm Americans aboard does not
un
cZlnuTnce of friendly relation, with

It was possible that lite Cymric was

WASHINGTON, May 9. The raid
into Glenn Springs was organized in
the United States, Arredondo told
Secretary' Lansing today. He charges
that I. Vlllareal probably was respon
sible. Scott's message this morning indi
cated tljat the conference with Obre
gon had ended and efforts to secure
the pact had been shattered. It inti
mated that Obregon had not threat
ened to use force, but It stated that
the "situation is no good and we bet
ter prepare for trouble."
Obregon has demanded a time lim
it to the expedition remaining in
Mexico. The cabinet today decided
to refuse this positively. It, was learn
ed that the department of Justice Is
extensively investigating the Mexican
raids, believing they were organized
here.
Officials said that the European
powers might desire intervention,
wishing to have America on the Job
for the Influence that such a cam
paign w ould have on Europe. It was
said that American Interests owning
huge properties in- Mexico were re
garded as likely to want intervention
t, redeem their holdings.
The force starting after the Mara
thon raiders was regarded as pitifully
j rmall. Funston was unable to reln
i force the battalion however.
"I have no more men to send," he
said despairingly. The country
! ahead of the tiny column Is the most
difficult in northern Mexico. There
is no forage enroute. The chances of
catching the bandits is believed
small. That section of territory has
;ind his lines of communication are
efficient. Scott and Obregon today
sent their governments lengthy re-
, !Mirts "' last nights meeting.
Funston has been fully empowered
to dispose of the national guard
troops, The militia is available for
service in Mexico if needed. The
president's step does not require con
gressional action unless the militia
crosses the border. If crossed the mi -
litia will be enrolled as volunteers,
losing the status of militia. This is
the first time since the Spanish-American
war that the militia has been
called out. Official records show
that the militia of the three states
comprises 5.360 men.
