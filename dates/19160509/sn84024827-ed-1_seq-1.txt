the only other means of adding ma

to employ coast artillery troops as

nothing to indicate that General Fun

The Glenn Springs raid has serveo
to make clear tbe attitude of the
j State Department regarding General
jCarranza's note suggesting the with-
drawal of the American expedition.
I It was stated offcially today that the

but rests upon a demonstration of the
ability of the Carranza forces to pro
tect the international line. The Texas
raid apparently places the fulfillment
of the condition further in the future.
In the meantime the original agree

OFF TO THE CIRCUS.
WASHINGTON. May S Pres
ident Wilson went to the circus
tonight. Seated on the , front
row, fanning himself and Mrs.
Wilson with a palm leaf fan
and sharing a bug of peanuts
with Secretary McAdoo, he ap
parently lost nothing of the
holiday spirit of t.'ie occasion. A
group of clowns carried out
their antics just in front of
him, furnished a particularly
appreciable spectacle to the
president.
When the party entered the
big tent the crowd of .several
thousand rose and cheered. As
he passed one of the rings the
president took off his hat and
laughingly made a motion as if
to throw it in. The crowd
quickly caug.'itthe point and
applauded again.
The President and his party
stayed until the very end of the
show, and were almost the last
to leave. He smiled broadly
when a "peace ship" manned by
lighting sailors and command
ed by a clown made up to rep
resent former Secretary Bryan,
passed around the ring. t
