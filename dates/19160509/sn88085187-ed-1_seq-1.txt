WASHINGTON, D. C, May 9.
—President Wilson liaa called
the militia of Texas, Ari/.oua and
Now Mexico for service on the
Mexican border, Secretary of War
Uakei announced today,
The following statement was
Issued:
"The outbreak in the Hig Bend
district has further emphasized
tbe danger of similar oceurances.
Tbe president has ordered the
militia to report to Gen. Funaton,
who will assign the men to sta
tions along the border.
"In addition, two regiments of
regulars have been directed to
proceed to the border. Further
arrangements will lie made aa
necessary to complete the secur
ity of the people against raids."
The regular Infantry from Fort
Lnwton and Vancouver, Wash.,
and I'roni I'lattslittrg and Oswego,
New York, were ordered to the
hot lier.
Sec. Baker said that the orders
were the result of recommenda
tions made by Gens. Scott and
Fiitiston.
I i> to I'tiiiHton.
(leu. Funston has been fully
empowered to dispose the troops.
Tlie militia is available for ser
vice:- in Mexico if heeded.
Tbe president's step doesn't
require congressional action un
less the in i lit in eroasea the bor
der. If it crosses, the troops will
be enrolled as volunteers, losing
the status of militia.
This i*i tin- first time since
the Mpaiiisli- Intel ii an war
that the militia has been
called. Official records slum
that the militia of the three
at .'lie*, called comprise ft,_tM>
men.

In U. S.?
WASHINGTON, I). ('., May
9.—The Mevlraii raid ou
Glenn Springs was organized
in the I'nited States, Con
eul A i rii Im 111, i told Sec.
Lansing today.
He < lunged thai I. VII* '
lineal probably was respon*
aible.
Gen. Scott's message this
morning Indicated that hla con
ference with Gen. Obregon had
ended, and that the efforts to
rerun- a pact had been shattered.
He intimated that Obregon had
not threatened to ÜBe force, but
that "the situation is not good,
and we belter prepare for trou
ble."
Obregon demanded a time limit
for the American expediton re
maining In Mexico. The cabinet,
decided today to refuse thia posi-
lively.
It was learned that the depart
ment of Justice is making exten
sive investigations of the Mexican
raids, believing that they were
organized here.
7 of Captured
Men Are Saved
MARATHON, Tex., May 9. —
Seven Americans whom the Mexi
cans captured overpowered their
guards and escaped across the
border, bringing three guards
with them .as prisoners, dis
patches said today.
American troops and a posse
of cowboys crossed the border
below Olenn Springs laat night,
riding at a breakneck speed. W.
Mathews Is bringing the bodies of
three wounded from the scene of
the raid, Including that of Cap
tain Rodriguez, one of the raid
ere.

WASHINGTON, l>. <\.
May 0. —Army official., today
cai-efully < urn ealed the con
tent* of Gen. Scott's report.
The tone N unmistakably
aeriiiiia, it Ik believed.
Many believe thst Gen.

Gen. CuiiHii/H. Humors of

Intervention
Gang Is Busy
EL PASO, May 9.—Working
unseen, intervention advocates
were most active today striving
to upset the peace negotiations
between Gen. Scott and Obregon.
The decision to send Ameri
cans across the border to pursue
the (ileum- Springs raiders can-t
--ed friction in last night's meeting
of the conferees. It is believed
the negotiations have not been
called off, however.
Officials said that European
powers might desire intervention.
Also American interests owning
huge properties in Mexico are
regarded as likely to want in
tervention to redeem their hold
ings.
The force starting from Mara
thon after the raiders is regarded
aa pitifully small. Oen. Funston
was unable_ to reinforce the bat
talion as he had no more men to
send. The country ahead of the
tiny column Is the worst in Mex
ico. It has long been Inhabited
by desperadoes from both sides
of the border.
The column is well supplied
and the line of communication is
good aa far aa Gen. Pershing's
troops are concerned.

Border Gets
the Recruits
Recruits for the P. S. army are
being enlisted in Tacoma at the
rate of one a day, according to
the officer iv charge of the army
recruiting office here.
As fast as they are unlisted
they are being sent right off for
the Mexican border.
Whether he's for the Infantry,
cavalry or artillery, the recruit
doesn't need to know the first
thing about arms and ammuni
tion and horses to qualify, ila
only needs to pass the physical
examination.
The regulars are teaching him
everything in the tough school
down on the Mexican border. He
is placed in the ranks between
two old timers who put hlin
through all tlie drilling he needs.
With the calling out of the
Fori Lawton and Vancouver reg
ulars today, the Northwest is left
with scarcely any troops outside
of the state militia.

Root Out
Firebugs
An active campaign against

nounced today by Commissioner
Pettit, following the firing of a
meat market on McKinley hill
last midnight.
Numerous incendiary fires have
occurred In Tacoma during the
last year. Fire Marshal Harry
Chandler has actively inveatigat
ed many of them but the police
department has paid little atten
tion to the evidence unearthed.
"There has been too much ar
son in Tacoma,'" said Coinmle
sioner Pettlt today. "I am confi
dent there are incendariats here
who are deliberately setting fire
to dwellings and business struc
tures." |

til 1 1 p. in., balancing his books.-
Firemen found that the blaze
originated under a counter. There
was $500 Insurance on the place.
The shop was praeelcally ruined,
with loss of over $1,000.
"There la no doubt that tho
fire was Incendiary," aald Fie¥
Marshal Chandler today. "1 be
lieve that thla fire was started
through spite."
Marshal Chandler, with Detec
tive D. O. Smith, is making a
rigid investigation.

FIGHT FOR FAIR RATES
TO SOUND CITIES OPENS
Woman
Rebel's
Coming
A plea to rebel agHinst moth
erhood, unless some contribution
la made by science toward the
elimination of tbe danger and
suffering incident to it, will lie
made to Tacoma women noxt
week by Mrs. Robert _t. Liggett
of St. Paul, Minnesota, who will
lecture on "Twilight Sleep" at
the Klks' auditorium every al'ter
noou and evening, beginning Sun
day, May 11.
Airs. Liggett has aroused a
storm of protest by appealing to
women to refuse to be mothers
until motherhood is made easier,
and by offering as the only niv*
tion of present conditonx, the
prohibition of motherhood to
women w hose nervous systems
have not been made sensitive by
education anil culture.
Ip to Hcier.ce.
"I say that no educated, cul
tured woman should be allowed
to be a mother under present
condition*," Mra, Liggett says.
"The only women who can lie
mothers wtlhout the atiffni-lng
wlibii nothing In the world can
justify are those who have not
the heritage of nerves, tempera
vent and physical development
which, aclenca admits is what
makes for suffering.
"It is time that science stop
frittering away its time on non
essentials and listen lo the cries
of women who risk their life and
ruin their health to populate the
world, which has always expected
too much of women, and even In
the lace of their proof of th°ir
importance civically, educational
ly and industrially, still expects
them to go through all the suf
fering of motherhood which we
are nil It-Told Is the will of God.'
U 111 Meet Clubwomen.
Mrs. Liggert Is lecturing on
twilight' sleep for the purpose,
ahe sajw, of putting it before the
women of tills state before the
meeting of the General Federa
tion of Women's Clubs In New
York city tee irst week in June.
Clubwomen of Tacoma will
meet with .Mrs. Liggett while, r,he
is here, and will discuss with her,
the radical views which she is
presenting.
The lectures will be open to
women only, for the purpose of
.allowing free discussion from the
audience.
Attack Women
Witnesses In
Liquor Case
Attorneys for Mayor Joseph
MoCaskey, proprietor of the City
Drug store of Wllkeson, charged
with Illegal sale of liquor, vio
lently attacked the reputations of
the state's witnesses in the open
ing statements today to the jury
In the .superior court.
Two of the chief witnesses
who claim to have bought li<|uor
from McCaskey's store arc wom
en. Attorney Hurmeister claimed
they were prostitutes and suld
they were plying their trade In
an Intoxicated condition In the
mining town; that they were
finally driven from the city and
that on all occasions they were
denied liquor at the drug store.
Stste's attorneys objected
strenuously to the insinuations
made by Burmeister, claiming that
the charges could not bo proved.
"It Is merely an attempt on the
part of the defense to affect the
credibility of the witnesses,"
the deputy prosecutor objected.
A dozen or so bottles of fancy
liquor decorated a table In front
of the jury aa evidence In the
case.

travel to the Northwest.
"The rates are a detriment to
the best development of Alaska,''

are allowed to remain in force;
the wonders of the northern ter
ritory will be shut off from hun
dreds of people whom Alaska
needs if it la to grow and pros
per."
"The Northwest is in competi
tion with the rest of Ihe world
for tourUts," was the statement
of Chairman Charles A. Reynolds,
chairman of the public service
commission, at the opening of
the iiearing.
'I'm onin lti'i-i I--I-HH il.
"That Is the basis on which
we are demanding Ihe elimination
of the |17.60 difference that ex
ists In round-trip fares from Chi
cago hy Sun Francisco, Which
tlie traveler must pay if he wants
to come a shorter distance via the
Northw-pt rather than the long
