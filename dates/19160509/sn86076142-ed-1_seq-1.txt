BASKETBALL PLAYERS REMEMBERED
W THE TONOPAH SCHOOL TRUSTEES
The basketball team of the high
I school was treated to a very agreeable
, surprise yesterday afternoon, when
President J. B. Tregloan, on behalf of
' i lie school board, presented to each of
the members of the team a lovely
white corduroy sport coat. The mem
bers of the main team are Captain Ger
flrude Kippingham, Ella Perry, Lavina
i Shields, May Kimball, Helen Mitchell
bor-jand Kannle Holmes. The substitutes
: Include Helen Clendennlng, Helen
j Davis, Arlien Dalzell, Addie Murphy
'and lnet O'Connell. On the coats of
the first six, a large "T" Is embroider
ed In red on the sleeve and the coats
of the substitutes bear a red mono
gram. "T. IL, 8." specially designed,
on the large pocket. By a little stra
tegy the perfect fittings of the coats
was secured. The girls were led to
believe the measure of the neck was
needed to obtain some newly designed
neckties and a few other little ruses,
secured for each one the dashing coat
each one possesses. To say the least,
the girls were bewildered with aston
ishment when Mr. Tregloan made
known to them that the school board
desired to give a testimonial which
would express In a small way recog
nition of their athletic work during
the past year. He did not wish them
in any way to construe the board's ac
tion as placing their academic work
as secondary. On the contrary he
dwelt on the proper use of sport and
placed emphasis on the value of phy
sical exercise as great aid to study
but that it must necessarily lake a
lower rank in school work.
The astonishment of the girls was
most amusing. Some of them ran all
the way home to bear the glad tidings.
When Mr. Tregloan had finished his
address Captain Gertrude Rlpplngham
responded in behalf of the team and
thanked the school noard for their
kindness and expressed the hearty Rp
preclntion of her team for the gifts
bestowed.
Joe Murphy responded for the stu
dent body, thanking the directors for
their backing and sincere Interest In
their work of the year. He also paid
a tribute to the girls assuring them
of the Intense pride and esteem in
which they were held by the whole
school. .

TERRIBLE LIFE IN GERMAN TYPHUS GAHP
REPORTED BY A SURVIVOR 0
' llr AuMM-latetl Ptmm.1
LONDON, May 9. Major Priestley,
of the army medical corps, has sup
plemented the recent official report
on the typhus epidemic among British
prisoners of war In the Wittenberg
camp in Germany last year, with fur
ther descriptions of the horrors that
he encountered there. Major Priestly,
It will be remembered, was one of six
British doctors sent to the Witten
berg camp by the Germans when, it
is alleged, the German medical staff
abandoned Its post at the camp after
the typhus broke out. Major Priestly
is one of the three survivors among
these six British doctors, the others
having succumbed to the fever.
"We were pushed through the barb
ed wire by the German guards," said
the major to an Associated Press cor
respondent In describing his Introduc
tion to the Wittenberg camp, "and in
structed to proceed to a certain hut
where we found our mattresses on
top of a stack of coffins
"It was dusk when we arrived and
it Is impossible to give you an ade
quate impression of the' terrible con
dition In which we found the camp.
We walked through the compounds to

tal, and although fifteen thousand pri
soners were crowded Into a space of
ten and one half acres, we might have j
been walking through a camp of i
ghosts for all the notice that was'
taken of our progress. The men seem-
ed dazed and apathetic. That night
we began our desperate fight against
typhus with all of tne odds in Us
favor.

sanitary conveniences, but utterly
lacked the most elementary comforts.
