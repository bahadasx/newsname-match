Old Folks Day.
*
Prosperity, May 8.?A telegram was

sunshine in their journey through
life.
Prosperity was shocked Saturday
jjvrning to learn of the death of Mrs.
Elizabeth DeWalt. Mrs. DeWalt has
been sick only since Wednesday and
her condition had improved to such
an extent that her friends had no
idea that her end was so near. She
was such a lovable character that she
counted her friends by the score and
was truly a Christian woman. Mrs.
DeWait was the widow of Mr. G. G.
DdWialt who preceded her to the
grave about 20 years ago. She is survived
by one daughter, Mrs. G. Y.
Hunter at whose home she died, also
three brothers and two sisters.

floral, offerings attested to her popularity.

As each. year passes and the time
draws aear when the peopie of tiie
South assemble to pay their annual
tribute of love and remembrance to!
those who gave their lives while fight-'
ing to uphold the honor and to pre- j
serve the liberties of their section, we 1
are forcibly reminded of the rapidly- j
thining ranks of the survivors of this i
great struggle and that within a few |
more years, the last one of them will j
have crossed the river, where the'
sound of battle cannot disturb his J
peaceful slumbers. The cause for j
which they so bravely battled was lost;
and the flag that they bore over so I
many fields of courage, where doath J
and its victim stood face to face, has j
been furled forever with the sanctity I
of a people's love resting upon it, anil j
stained with the life blood of some
of our best and bravest sons. But despite
all of this, they have not died
in vain, for in their deaths they have
endriched the pages of military history
and furnished an Example of patriotism
and devotion that will be an Inspiration
to all who live after them,
and which will be remembered as
long as time endures.
But how can we best observe the 1
day? It should not be made a gala

significance and beauty, and where
the lessons we should learn from its I
observance are ignored and will soon j1
be lost. 'Neither should we observe J
it with inalice in our hearts, but rath-j
er fcn the spirit of love and forgiveness
for the injuries we have suffer- '
ed. But while we approach the day
with these feelings we can still be j
proud of our gallant dead and en-|
shrike them forever in our hearts.'
They are not here to speak for themselves,
but if they could make their
wishes known, we may be sure that
they would endorse the sentiments
expressed above, 'fhe occasion should
be made use of to inspire the hearts |
of the rising generation to always
bedr in mind that many of them are
descended from these truly great men,
fof they were truly great in their}
patriotism, and that it is incumbe t j
cn them not to bring reproach on the j
nrmes they bear and in which they.
may well take an honest pride, but. j
remembering at the same time that aj
name is noble only when nobly borne. I
Then, too, it must be bornes.in mind j
that the spirit of true patriotism is i
o;:e of the noblest attributes of human
character, and that the man who
is lacking in this is lacking in all else j
that can make a man either great or j
good.
We but honor ourselves when we
honor our gallant dead, and it is a
beautiful and appropriate custom to
tell of their deeds on the battlefield,
tell of their unflinching heroism in
the time that tried the souls of all
true men, and to decorate the graves
with beautiful flowers, as appropriate

brance, at the same time lifting our
hearts in an unspoken prayer that !
we may be strengthened in our desires
that our lives, in all things, may
reflect honor on those wlio have passed
into the Great Beyond.
And to you, fellow-soldiers of the <
Confederate army, the writer makes
this, possibly his last farewell words," "
prayer: That the blessing and protection
may rest upon you in. your
declining years; that you may have a 4
sufficiency of worldly comforts until 4
the end; that you may have that ]
serenity and peace which can come ]

for the World Film program under
the personal supervision of fiarley
Knoles, who wrote the scenario.
