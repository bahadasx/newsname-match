Washington, Maj -i.A renewed request for with
drawal of the American expedition from Mexico will be
made by Mexican Ambassador Designate Arredondo at an
engagement this forenoon with Secretary Lansing. It
was assumed that he might make the request stronger
than heretofore, by reason of the reported threat of Gen
eral Obregon to use the Carranzista troops if the with
drawal was not accomplished immediately.
The most important developments lin flhe Mexican
situation was expected following the receipt of a long
code message from Generals

Staff Bliss remained at the
to receive it. There was no
forthcoming early today.
The message was regarded as highly significant in
view of reports that Obregon
presence of the Villa pursuers in Mexico would mean an
attack by Carranzistas. The communication was sent in
strict confidence.
The general feeling here was that Mexican affairs had
suddenly grown worse. Bliss returned to the war depart
ment at 8:30 a. m. He said
Secretary of War Baker. Asked if the situation was
serious he replied: "I can't

Mexican Representative Says
It Is An Attempt to Cause
Intervention -
Washington, May 9 The raid by
Mexicans on Glenn springs was organ
ized in the United States, Mexican
Consul Arredondo charged today in a
conference with Secretary Lansing.
Arredondo named I. Villarcal as the
principal ngitator responsible for the
raid and plots. He said he had no in
dication of a further request from Gen
eral Obregon or any Mexican officials
that the American troops be withdrawn.
All he knew, he Boid, was that Generals
Scott and Obregon were still conferring.
He urged that a larger body of troops
be stationed to guard tho American
aide of tho international boundry and
watch the conspirators who were en
deavoring to stir up a mutiny among
Cnrranzistas and inflame border senti
ment. Lansing will take up the charges
immediately with Secretary of War
Buker.
A illareal endeavored to stir up a
mutiny -of Carranzistas at Laredo, Mex
ico, mid failing in this, picked out the
border point which had the scantiest
guard, Arredondo charged. He said
that if it had not been for American
arms and information from American
sources the raid on Glenn Springs could
not have been successful. Arredondo
declared that he feared further raids of
the same sort if the utmost vigilance
was not observed. Tho purpose of the
raids, he believed, was an attempt to
embroil the Carranzistas aud the United
States. Two other towns are now
selected as objects of Villarcal raids.
Arredondo told Lansing.

By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, May 9. For the first
time since the Spanish-American war,
tho president today called out the mili
tia, to aid the regulars in the interna
tional crisis with Mexico.
The use of militia will not call for
any action by congress at the present
time since the nntional guardsmen will
be used in patrolling the American side
ot the border. The annua of New Mex
ico, Arizona and Texs, the three states
affected by the call, comprises 5,300 of
ficers and men.
President Wilson also ordered four
regiments of regular infantry to the
border. Tho decision to call out the
militia followed a conference between
Wilson and Secretary of War Baker,
after tho latter had received two code
messages from General Funston.
In announcing the move, Baker
?uid the step constituted no change in
the policy of the United States toward
Mexico.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo told
Secretary Lansing today that he be
lieved the raid on Glenn Springs, Texas,
was engineere-1 irom the American side
of the bolder. Hb charged that 1. Vil
lareul was probably responsible, nssert
ing that Villarcal had attempted to stir
up mutinies among the 3c facto govern
ment troops.
Two Regiments Regulars to do.
Washington, May S. Secretary of
War Baker announced today that the
president had authorized the calling out
of the militia of the states of Arizona,
New Mexico and Texas for service on
the Mexican border. He declares that
the raid by Mexicans on the Big Bend
country had so far emphasized the dan
ger of further attacks that President
Wilson had authorized the militia call.
Secretory of War' Baker issued the
following statement:
"The outbreak in tho Big Bend dis
trict so further emphasized the dan
ger of similar occurrences that the
president called out the militia of Tex
as, Arizona and New Mexico and di
rected them to report to General
Funston who will assign them to sta
tions along the border.
"In aJTition, two regiments of reg
ulars have been directed to proceed to
the border and such further arrange
ments will be mado as may be neces
sary to complete the security of the
people against raids of this charac
ter." The following units of infantry have
been ordered to the border: The Thir
tieth of Plattsourg, N. Y.; Third of Os
wego, N. Y.; Twenty-first of Vancou
ver, Wash., and the Fourteenth of Fort
Lawton, Wash.
The militia of the three states totals
about 4,000 men. Baker would not sav
whether the orders were the result of
General Scott's message. He declared
they woro bused on reeommndutions
from Scott and General Funston with
regard to the Texas ram. linker would
not denv or affirm thnt General Obre
gon nnd demanded the withdrawal of
American troops on penalty of a clash.
Funston is given full powers to dis
pose of tho troops as he sees best. The
forces are available for service in Mex
ico if needed. The president's step
docs not require action by congress un
le the militia should cross the border.
In such an event, the national guards
men will uf enrolled as volunteers, los
ing thoir status as militia.
Arizona Mobilizes Militia.
Phoenix. Ariz., May 9. Adjutant
General Harris, upon receipt of orders
from Washington this morning ordered
immediate mobilizutrun of the Arizona
militia for border service. Only four
troops, half the paper strength of the
state guard are uvniluble, it is esti
mated, Mobilization orders were greeted
quietly here. There wag little demon
stration on the part of guardsmen. They
were in too great a rush to close up
their business and piepare for service.
Orders hud been expected here since
the raid on Glenn Springs, Texas.
Owing to the recent Internal political
disturbances in Arizona, the Rational
guard was in process of reorganization
when the orders were received this
morning. Two companies were recently
mustered out in Phoenix. They will
probably reinlist to the man, in the op
inion of officers of the mustered com
panies. The guard will be iendy for service
Wednesday night. .Measures were tak
en today to establish recruiting stations

R. Cleavcland, alias J. A. Young, plead
ing with Judge Card to temper justice
with mercy. Cleaveland had pleaded
guilty to larceny, the specific cliargo
being that he obtained $2,500 from P. J.
Fransioli & Co. by means of fraudulent
bills of lading. Clcavelnna is under
sentence today to serve from four to
15 years in the state penitentiary. He
confessed, say officers, tA hnving ob

those employed in tho Fransioli swindle,

Innd mid Snn Francisco.- 1 ,
Cleaveland claims to have been post
master and mayor of n town in Utah
at one time. Then, he told Judge Card,
fire destroyed all his property, but by
hard work ho prosperod once more. In
the financial panic, of a few years ago,
he lost $-40,000. He was gradually get
ting 'a second start when, Cleaveland
said, a concession he obtained at the
exposition, turned out badly.
"I know the law must be respected,
for I am an intelligent ninn," Cleave
land snid. "But I've had my lesson.
Every time I tried anything with taint
ed money I always lost. All I wanted
was to educate my children, and give
them a chance. My one desire has been
to support my family. Now my boys
will have to leave school."
Judgo Card said Clcavelnnd's ideas
about getting money were nil wrong and
sentenced him to the penitentinry.

CYMRIC WAS TORPEDOED
D WITHOUT till
It Is Considered Possible Germany Has Not Yet Been Abb
to Communicate Orders to Commander of All Sub
marinesUntil Definite Information Is Received OScials
Will Not Discuss Matter-No Americans Were On Board
and the Entire Crew Was Saved
By Robert J. Bender
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, May 9. The new German submarine
policy may have been tested in -the case of the Cymric,
torpedoed White Star liner.
If there was no warning before the deadly projectile
was launched, the attack apparently violates the orders tcr
undersea boat commanders which the German govern
ment declared had been put into effect.
The fact that there were no Americans aboard, of
ficials said today, does not enter the case. Germany has
declared that its orders to submarine commanders were
intended to confine their operations to the fighting forces
of the belligerents. The Cymric was not a fighter.
The effect of the incident is problematical. If there
were any Americans aboard, quick disavowal and repara
tion from Germany are expected. '
This government has made maintenance of friendly
relations with Germany contingent upon abandonment of
such attacks as the one reported yesterday. Germany's
reported issuance of orders to U-boat captains were to
prevent such episodes. It is possible that the Cymric was
the victim of a submarine the crew of which had not yet
received the new instructions. Until all the facts are
known," Washington officials will not discuss the possible
effect of the accident.
The status of German-Amejicnn re
lations today is as follows:
If (lermuiiy is unwilling to abide by
in ternntional law in its submarine op
erations except in return for successful
United States negotiations with Grentf
Britain she must say so definitely. By
ncceptnnco of President Wilson's note
with its declaration thnt Great Britan's
policies do not enter into settlement of
the issue, Germany can bring the mat
tor to an end.
Pending word from Herlin, the presi
dent assumes that this is Germany's
intent. Full acceptance of tho Amer
ican torms is anticipated by the admin
istration. Anything less than that, of
ficials say, is likely to mean the long,
threatened break.
The report that the Cymric was in
the service df the British admiralty
freshly complicated the situation. If
this is true and the steamer is there
fore classed ns a warship, the United
States is not concerned in the attack.
On tho contrary, it was pointed out
that the customs collector of the port of
new York would not grant clearances to
a ship engaged in unneutral business.
The fact that the, Cymric, was allowed
to clear indicated that its status was
no different from thnt of other mer
chantmen which were granted immun
ity. Was Torpedoed Monday.
London, May U In vbwof the latest
German submarine pledges, American
consuls v.ere directed today to obtain
details of the torpedoing ot the liner
Cymric. Neither the British admiralty
or White (Star li r.e ageuts gave out any
information except brief dispatches
from Cjiicenstovn Baying that the big
steamer was torpedoed at' o'clock
Monday. It was pointed out that should
it bo learned tha the Cymric was not
warned, this fact would not offer proof
that the subniarino commanders were
not keeping faith with the United
States. New instructions have been is
sued to them in accordance with the
kaiser's pledges, but possibly the sub
marine wlii-h attached the Cymric left
its base before the new orders wcro is
sued. The line office believe.) that there
were not Americans aboard, although
one or two American sailors may have
been shipped at New York. For the
Inst six weeks the Cymr'c uas nHt car"
ried passengers.

London, May . The liner Cymric,

An earlier message said several steam
ers wero proceeding to the rescue, and
it is assumed has taken off the sailors.
