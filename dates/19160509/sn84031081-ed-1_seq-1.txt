It is regarded as unquestionable
that the latest incident will have a
strong influence upon the time when
American troops will be withdrawn
from Mexico. The agreement reached

but rests upon a demonstration of the

rine policy and now relies upon a
scnmulous execution of the altered
policy to remove the principal danger
of an interruption of the good rela

ot Germany' 4 Iffair,
Secretary Lansing Issued a state
ment tonight saying that the create,
port of Germany's answer to the de
mand of the United Stales was devot
iii to mutters which the American
government could not di-'euss with the
Uertig. government, but be considered
Germany had "yielded to our repre
sentations" and that "we inn have no
uason io quarrel will, her," ao long
as Ihe altered policy is lived up lo.
Following Is Ihe text of the note
cabled today by Secretary Lansing to
Ambassador Gerard at ikriin with In
structions to deliver it to (he Ger
man minister of foreign affairs:
l ull Text of Note.
The note of the imperial German
government under dale of May
19111, has received careful considera
tion by Hh- government of the United
States. It is especially noted as In
dicating Ihe purpose of the imperial
government as to the future, that it
'is prepared to do lis utmost to con
fine the operation of the war for the
rest of its duration to the fighting
forces of the belligerents,' and that
II is determined to impdse upon all
Its commanders at sea (ha limitations
of the recognised rules of internation
al law upon which the government of
Ihe United States has insisted.
Restrained t tVlendslilp.
"Throughout the months which
have elapsed since tile imperial gov
ernment announced on February 4,
i!1f,, its submarine policy, now hap
pily abandoned, the government of
the United Stales nas neen cumwm-
i ;., i I , i ..ti iii.i V,c lllOltvcS
l ........ i uiiu ...... ...... u ....
of friendship in its patient el forts to
bring to an amicable settlement the
critical questions arising from that
policy. Accepting the Imperial gov
ernment's declaration of its abandon
ment of the policy which has so ser
iously menaced the good relations be
tween the two countries, the govern
ment of the United States will rely
upon a scrupulous execution hence
forth of the now altered policy of the
Imperial government such as will re
move the principal dnnger to an in
terruption of the good relations exist
ing between the United states and
Germany,
Will Not DtSCUMB Matter.
The government of the United
States feels it necessary to state that
ll takes it for granted that the Im
perial government does not intend to
imply that the maintenance of Its
newly announced policy Is In any way
contingent upon the course or result
of diplomatic negotiations between the
government of the United States and
any other bellljrerent government,
notwithstanding the fact that certain
passages in the Imperial govern
ment's note or tb,- fourth Instant
might appear to be susceptible of that
construction In order, however, to
avoid ay possible misunderstanding,
the government of the united states
notifies the imperial government thai
It can not for a moment entertain,
much less discuss a suggestion that
respect by the German naval author!
lies for the rights of citizens of the.
United States upon the high seas
should in any way or in the slightest
degree be made contingent upon the
conduct of imv other government af
fecting the rights of m utrala and non
combatants Responsibility in srci
mntiers Is Single, not Joint; absolute,
not relative."
Mr. Lansing's statement mad,- pub
lic after the note was ..n Its way to
Berlin follows:
siaiemeni bf UaasllUi
"Tha greater part of the German an
swer is devoted to matters whb h this
government cannot discuss with the
German government. The only que
lions of righl which can be discussed
with that government are those aris
