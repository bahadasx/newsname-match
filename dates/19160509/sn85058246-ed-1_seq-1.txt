FISH AND GAME
COMMITTEE IS
tf . AN ACTIVE ONE
m -
9 Have Procured Quail Which Will Be
HS Liberated In North Logan. May
Hi Get Catflih
Kfi -r It anyono thinks the fish and
Kg t game committee of the Commorclnl
ffi Boosters Club Is not an active one
H they havo another guess coming. A
iM conversation with Chairman John
K Christiansen about the numerous
Ex things which this committee pro-
poses doing will convince nnyono
js that theso hoys are not asleep. Only
ffs yesterday twelvo pairs of genulno
13 California quail were on exhibition
1 in the window of tho Logan Arms,
Ig and In tho evening they wero taken
5 to tho foothills at North Logan and
8 liberated.
n The California quail arc said to
ho a very hardy bird and will thrlvrj
( well In this altitudes and climate If
tho proper protection Is thrown
; about them. Near Farmlngton these
birds arc multiplying very fast and
' wltli tho scattering of n few pairs
! over tho different parts of Utah, the
gamo fanciers hope to stock the on-
1 tiro stato.
Another matter which tho Fish and
Game commlttco has in mind Is to
plant somo channel catfish In Logan
river south and west of tho park.
Catfish are said to bo a fish that
win kill carp, something that Is
. very much desired In our streams.
They will nlso fight trout, but can
not survive Jn swift colj water, so
it would seem that tho catfish aro
I very much to bo desired in tho still
I waters of tho Logan river.
I Tho stato Is supplying these flsh
I and quail and will cooporato with
I the local committee In assisting In
I replenishing our streams with flsh
I and our hills with wild game.

Wife of the Late Herschel Bullen
Passes Away. Will Be Burled
At Richmond, Thursday
Mary Josephlno Bullen, wlfo of tho
late Herschel Bullen of Richmond,
died at her residence In this city on
Sunday evening at 8:25 p. m. after
a short Illness. For sometime sho
had not been feeling well, and about
'en days ago contracted a severe
caso of lagrlppo, followed by stom
ach and Intestinal complications.
For soverai days the pain and suf
fering was almost unbearable. All
that science and willing hands could
do was done to rellovo her suffering
and restore her to health, but from
the beginning sho seemed to bo re
signed to her npporent fate nnd fail
ed to respond with any degree of
satisfaction to anything that was
done for her. she seemed rea"dy
nnd willing to go and when death
claimed her, passed away without a
murmur or struggle
Mary J. Bullen wns tho daughter
of J. C. and Mary Ann Whittle of
Richmond, Utah, and was born at
Fort Herrlman, Utah, July 19, isr.i,
and would have been C9 In July. On
December 20 1870, sho wns married
to tho late Herschel Bullen, of Rich
mond, by tho lato William B. Pres
ton, of Logan. Sho is the mother
of seven children, Roy Bullen, city
engineer of Logan; Mrs. Pearl Har
rlson, of Logan; Cyrus Bullen, farm
er of Richmond; Emma Bullen, de
ceased; Asa Bullen, lawyer; and Bry
ant Bullen of the Motor Sales Cor
poration, of Logan; nnd Mrs. Edith
Robinson, of Long Beach, Cnllfornln.
In addition sho was a good nnd truu
mother to Herschel Bullen Jr., and
Mrs. Nellie Lnngton, who were small
children nt tho time, orhjr marriage
Sho was a woman of high Ideals,
strong characteristics, and so dl
divinely conscientious, unselfish, and
determined, that whatever sho decid
ed upon, or set forth to do, was al
ways carried forward to successful
solution. In speaking of her sudden
death yesterday, Herschel Bullen
Jr., said: "She was always tho same
good, uiiBclflsh mother to all of us.
and her death Is one of tho greatest
blows that could come to us. No
hotter, truer, nobler woman ever
graced tho earth. This planet may
produco her equal, but never her su
perior, for that Is not within tho
rank of tho possible."
A short funeral service will bo
held nt tho residence on First West
street In this city, Thursday morn
ing nt 10 o'clock, after which the re
mains will bo taken to tho home of
Cyrus Bullen of Richmond, where,
tho friends of her youth and woman
hood and associates of a life time,
may view them. At 2 o'clock In tho
Richmond Tabernacle tho funeral
services will bo held, after which
the remains will bo Interred In the
Richmond cemetery bcsldo thoso of
her lato husband.

DRAINAGE WORK
TO BEGIN IN
COLLEGE WARD
Within n few days work will be
gin on the drnlnngo of about 3000
ncres of land In the North College
ward district whero tho Logan Land
Drainage Company has been out
lining n district. Several car loads
of tile are now on Uio ground nnd
men are engaged In distributing
them along tho lines of drainage
Trenching machines aro expected to
day, shipped from Dodge City, Iowa,
and Crnwfordsvllle, Indlann.
Mr. J. H. Casey of Crnwfordsvllle,

to d0 this work for the Logan Land

with a crew of men yesterday and
will urrlvo hern Wednesday or Thurs

who aro being brought hero aro ox
pert machine operators but novoral
local men will bo employed and n
"number of teams put to work. Tho
.drnlnago will very likely bo com
pleted by December 1, unless un
foreseen obstacles Interfere.
"While Logan rlv.r Is extremely
high," sold Malinger A. F. Canton
of the Logan Land & Drnlnago Co.,
"it will not Interfere with dralnngo
work as wo had It planned. Our flrtl
unit to bo drnlncd Is south of tho old

of any danger whatever of flood wa
ters. In ,faet there Is only n small
part of our land, and thnt Is right
down nt tho extreme low part, that
Is Inundated by tho high wntcr. Wo
oxpect that tho river will bo dyked
nnd somo of tho extreme oxbow
bends will be eliminated by straight-
filing out tho river, and theso chang
es will prevent any further flooding
of the land, As high as tho water Is
at tho present time, Its flooding of
tho land could have easily been
nvolded by closing jiomo of the
