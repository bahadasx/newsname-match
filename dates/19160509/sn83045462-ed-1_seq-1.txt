The jury in the Iliggs Bo k ease

This teas a big surprise at the
closing of the morning session of
court. It is the first time that this
action has been taken since the
jury teas locked tip in the famous
Hyde-Benson-Diamond ease, which

The old custom teas to lock up
the juries only in capital cases, but
for some years it has been the
practice not to lock them up. even
in capital cases.
United States Attorney Laskey
stated that the action taken today
was not at his behest, but was a ,
voluntary action on the part of the
court.
The deputy marshals were sworn
to take charge of the jury during
the pendency of the trial, and they
obligated themselves to see that no
outsider talked with them or that
they read newspaper accounts of
the trial, or that the deputy marshals

tary Lansing Explains.
Officials of the administration, althrtiiirh
nnl riisnn?p<l Ift dlsfUSS the OUCS- i
lions of the relations between the
United States and Germany, in its present
aspect, are awaiting today with
considerable interest to hear how the
latest note of President Wilson's is received
in Berlin. There seems to be
some doubt as to whether any reply
will be made. At any rate, no further
action will be taken by this government
except in the event of the destruction
of a merchantman and the
injury of Americans, either as passengers
or connected? with the crew,
through German submarine operations
in violation of the assurances contained
in the latest communication from Berlin.
It was at first supposed that the sinking
of the White Star liner Cymric, by a
German submarine might complicate
the situation, but it is stated officially
that the fact that that vessel was in
the admiralty service removes it from
the class of vessels entitled to the usual
warning required in the case of mer- J
hant vessels under the agreement.
Secretary Lansing Explains.
In making public the note to Germany
Secretary Lansing issued the following
statement on the subject:
"The greater part of the German answer
is devoted to matters which this
government cannot discuss with the
German government. The only questions
of right which can be discussed
with that government are those arising
out of its action or out of our own, and in
no event those questions which are "
the subject of diplomatic exchanges
between the United States and anv otli- ,
er country. J
"The essence of the answer is that
Germany yields to our representations
with regard to the rights of merchant
ships ami non-combatants on the high
seas and engages to observe the recognized
rules of international law governing
naval warfare in using her submarines
against merchant ships. So
long as/she lives up to this altered
policy we can have 110 reason to quar- 1
rel with her on that score, though the 1
losses resulting from the violation of
American rights by German submarine
commanders operating under the former
nollcv will have to be settled
Standing for Treaty Rights.
"While our differences with Great
Britain cannot form a subject of discussion
with Germany, it should be i
stated that in our dealings with the fj
British government we are acting, as we a
ate unquestionably bound to act, it) ]
view of the explicit treaty engagements .
with that government. We have treaty *
obligations as to the manner in which M
matters in dispute between the two t
governments are to be handled. We
offered to assume mutually similar ob- i
ligations with Germany, but the offer d
was declined. When, however, the sub- p
ject in dispute is a continuing menace g
to American lives it. is doubtful wheth-j
er such obligations apply unless the fi
menace is removed 'luring the pendency ,
of the proceedngs." 1
The treaty with the British government
referred to is the convention ne- n
gotiated by former Secretary Bryan uri- N
der which the two nations agree that ^
any dispute arising shall be submitted ^
to an investigating committee for one
year before entering into hostilities.
An offer to enter into such a treaty for t
Germany brought a request for information.
but formal negotiations never
were instituted. ^

That the du Pont Powder Company of J ^

for several months at Great Palls and i
that the company is not interested in
any way in the gold mining activities
on the Maryland side at the fails are
statements contained in a communication
from the company's publicity de- .
ptrtment to The Star. y
The communication says that reports
that the du Pont company was the real ^

Both Asked tor More Troops. I
Secretary Baker said the orders sending j
more troops to the border were made upon |
the joint recommendation of both Gen. I
Scott and Gen. Funston and were without
significance in connection with the ScottObregon
conferences. Regarding the
progress of these conferences Secretary
Baker said that Gen. Scott was awaiting
a communication from Gen. Obregon
Further than this the Secretary refused
to discuss the status of the conferences.
Gens. Scott and Funston advised the
War Department that more troops were
urgently needed along the border, as a

be expected They stated that the regulars

It was upon these recommendations the :
President and Secretary Baker decided to j
call into service the National Guards of I

protection of the border. He said he had |
not heard whether the American troops ' i
in the Big Bend region had actually I ,
crossed the boundary in pursuit of the 1
outlaws who raided Glenn Springs and .
