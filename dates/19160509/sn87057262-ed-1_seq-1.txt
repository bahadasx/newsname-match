EL PASO. Texas, May 9.—Working
unseen, interventionist forces were
active along tho border today, striv
ing mightily to upset the negotiations
between Generals Scott and Obregon
for a solution of the Mexican situa
tion. The decision of American com
manders to send the Marathon expe
dition across the border caused fric
tion in last night's meeting between
the two war leaders, coming in the
face of General Carranza's request for
the withdrawal of the Pershing
column and the meeting broke up
without a conclusion having been
reached. Though no arrangements
have been made for another meeting,
there is a feeling that negotiations
have not vet been declared ofT. Indi
cations pointed to another conference
within the next few days. While
Mexican authorities suspected that
European interventionists haT prior
knowledge that the Glenn Sprinp
raid was to be made, there is
a

force lay nearer home.

have been lost d&ring last night's gale
with all on board. She carried a crew
of twenty-one men.
The steamer went down off Eagle
Harbor In Lake Superior, in the sixty
mile gale that has swept the upper
lakes for twenty-four hours. One man
of the Klrby's crew of twenty-one is
reported to have been rescued by the
steamer Joseph Block which arrived
at the Soo today with details of the
Kirby disaster.
The barge Hartwell in tow of the
Kirby was picked up by the steamer

Life Boat Swamped.
DULTJTH, Minn., May 9.—The
steamer S. R. Kirby*s boilers blew
up when she put on high steam to
battle a terrific sixty mile gale, ac
cording to the second mate, who ar
rived here today.
The mate, who waa picked up by
the steamer Berwind, upbound, claim
ed that the Kirby carried a crew of
tiyenty-two and that one other mem
ber tyf the Crew was picked np by the
Joseph Block, down bound. The Ber
wind tried to save another, but he
was so exhausted that he slipped
from a raft and was lost before the
Berwind reached him. When the
Kirby's boilers exploded, she cut loose
the barge Hartwell.In tow. The mate
claimed to know definitely that the
Hartwell's crew of seven with Cap
tain Oliver Pitts and Engineer Syl

life boat which was swamped and1
that the nine were lost. The steamer
XJtley, he claimed, later picked up the

was unable to reinforce the battalion
now heading south.
"We have no more men to send," he
said, despairingly.
The country into which the men
must penetrate is the most difficult
in northern Mexico. Little water or
forage is to be had enroute and the
chances of catching the bandits under
the handicap were believed small.
The country along both sides of the
border has long been the refuge of
desperate characters from both Mex
jjco and the United States. The Big
Bend country has been to the bad
man of Texas and northern Mexico
what the Bad Lands of the north
were to the desperadoes years ago.
Funston felt secure regarding Per

will be able to take care of them
selves. Their supplies are ample and
their line of communication has been
developed to a high point of efficiency.
Both Scott and Obregon submitted
long reports to their governments fol

LONDON, iMay 9.—The London
newspapers dwell at length today on
the German peace rumors but either
declared the kaiser insincere or sug
gested that Germany must prepare to
yield far more than she has yet hint
ed if the allies are to enter peace ne
gotiations.
The foreign office gave out a mes
sage from Sir Henry Howard, British
envoy to the Vatican, denying that
Pope Benedict telegraphed President
Wilson and the kaiser, urging peace
moves.
The Dally Mall deotared Germany
not stnoere In her move for peace,
attributing the peace hint In the Ger
man reply to a desire to enlist the
sympathy of neutrals, convince the
German people that Germany is fight
ing a defensive war, and to lull the
allies to sleep by the belief that Ger
many was about to »urrender.
The Dally News, taking a different
view, declared that Germany within
the not distant future, will make a

"Until that time oomes, the allies
will not entangle themselves in futils

BERLIN, May 9.—German troops

announced this afternoon. All French
attempts to recapture German posi

On the northeast front of Verdun,
French attacks in the region of Thiau

the Germans on that sector now num

Secretary Lansing said he would

declared he feared further raids of tho

not observed. These raids, he de
clared, have the purpose of embroiling
Carranza with the United States.
On the Mexican side of the river,
opposite Glenn Springs, there is no
settlement within 100 miles capable
of furnishing shelter or supplies to
such a force as the 300 armed men

The Dutch steamer Grotius sent

Neither the admiralty nor the White

day except a brief message from
Queenstown saying the liner waa tor
pedoed at 4 o'olock yesterday after
noon. Whether the Cymric was at
tacked without warning probably will
not be known until she reaches port.
It was pointed out, however, that
even should it be learned that the
Cymric was torpedoed without warn
ing that fact would not offer proof
that boat commanders were not
keeping faith with America. New In
structions have been Issued to the
German submarine commanders in a&.
cordance with German pledged to the
United States, but it is quite possible
that the U. boat which attacked the
Cymric left its base before the new
orders were issued from Berlin. The
White Star office believes that no
Americans were among the crew of
110 carried by the Cymric, though one
or two American sailors may have
been taken on at New York. The
liner was capable of only about fif
teen knots an hour and with her
heavy war munitions cargo, would
have been easy prey to one of the
new and speedy German boats. For
the last six weeks she has carried no
passengers on her trips between New
York and Liverpool. German opera

EL PASO, Texas, May 9.—The Mex

today following reports that General
Obregon issued an ultimatum to Gen

ference, demanding withdrawal of
the American expedition and threat
ening an attack by Carranzistas as
an alternative. Funston was deeply
concerned over tho sudden tack de
velopments have taken, but declined
The message was regarded as es
pecially significant in view of border
reports that Oeneral Obregon had
served notice on Scott and Funston
that the further presence of the Vil

attack on them, by the Qarranfca to comment on th© reported ufti
troops. The message for which Gen

chief of staff.
