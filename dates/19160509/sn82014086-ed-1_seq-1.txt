officials hope effective co-operation be
tween American and 'Mexican troops to
exterminate the band of Mexican out
laws which raided Glenn Springs, Tex.,
last Friday night win follow the con
clusion of the conference at El Paso
between Generals Scott and Obregon.
(is the meantime, it was Btated official
ly both at the war and state depart
ment. General Funston has full author
ity to send his troops across the border
Dn any hot trail.
Secretary Baker conferred with
President Wilson this evening, but he
tala later there had been no develop
ments. Only meagre details of the raid have
reached Washington. The latest was a
consul report from Eagle Pass today
laying that three civilians and three
loidiers had been killed and two sol
ilers wounded and that the four re
maining men of the little, squad of
savalrymen were missing. The missing
troopers may have joined the posse

ward the border.
Officials would not comment on bor

General Funston's force is to be in
reased. IATIONAL CONFERENCE OF

has also been examined and Dr. Wolff
states that instead of death being the
result of natural causes it was due to
poison.

jail, being bound over to the next term
of the superior court.

on Prospect street. There are fifteen
patients there now. Patients are ac
cepted on two plans: a payment of
1,000 insures a home for life; fehers
than life patients pay a weekly rate.

she married Michael W. Gilligan, who.
the police say, died suddenly on Feb
ruary 20, 1914. He had apparently

gan mads a will turning all tls proper'
ty over to his wife. The will was not
admitted to probate on a technicality,
Mrs. Archer-Gilligan has one daugh
ter. Mary, aged 18, an assistant at the
home. A niece and a servant are the
onlv two others employed at the es
tablishment.
Chief T. F. Egan of the state police
late tonight declined to discuss the
case in detail, other than to say that
he has evidence showing that Mrs.
Archer-Gilligan purchased large quan
titles of a powerful poison within, tne
last few years."" Two days befofe "An
drews death. Chief Egan says., she
purchased two ounces of poison at a
Windsor drug stores.

"We stand for the protection of the
American and his business. For the
protection of his business by a tariff
established through an expert perma
nent commissiou and scientifically ad
justed to serve the welfare of all
Americans.
For that control of business which
shall ensure its development and pros
perity and .provide for the just distrl-
mtlon of that prosperity among all
our people. Unless our business forces
are directed toward high national
ends, our nation can never have its
due weight in international relations.
We cannot demand justice abroad un
less we do justice at home.
In our international relations this
fstheTear .of destiny: The action of
America in this year 1916 will deter
mine the long future of coming gen
erations and centuries.
Put Honor Foremost
We put foremost the honor, the
strength and the leadership of the
American nation in international mo
rality. We demand of our govern
ment, that first duty of all govern
ments, the protection of its citizens,
Not otherwise can America have a fu
ture of Its own; not otherwise can it
have the slightest weight in deter
mining the future of the world, the
future which will be settled at the end
of that great war.
' Will Lay Aside Partisanship:
Recognizing these great issues, we
will lay aside partisanship and party
ambition: we will serve those great
ends and those only. We will follow
a leader whose purposes we know
whose power to drive these ipurposes
to fulfilment we can continue. We
will follow no man whose position on
these Issues we do not know, or who
has not the power to make them good.

Government Can be in
Conduct of any Other Government Affecting the Rights
of Neutrals and Non-Combatants Note Was Cab! : !
Yesterday by Secretary Lansing to Ambassador Gerar J
With Instructions to Deliver it to the German Minsiter cf
Foreign Affairs.
"Washington, May 8. Following is
the text of the note cabled today by
Secretary Lansing to Ambassador Ger
ard at Berlin with instructions to de
liver it to the German minister of
foreign affairs:
"The note of the imperial German
government under date of May 4,
19US, has received careful considera
tion by the government of the United
States. It is especially noted, as in
dicating the purpose of the Imperial
government as to the future, that it
is prepared to do its utmost to con
fine the operation of the war for the
rest of Its duration to the fighting
forces of the belligerents and that it
Is determined to impose upon all its
commanders at sea the limitations of
tne recognized rules of international
law upon which the government ot
the United States has insisted.
Guided by Motives of Friendship.
"Throughout the months which
have elapsed since the imperial gov
ernment announced on February 4,
1915. its submarine policy, now hap
pily abandoned, the government of the
United States has been constantly
guided and restrained by motives of
friendship in its patient efforts to
bring to an amicable settlement the
critica questions arising" from that
policy.
Will Rely Upon Scrupulous-Execution
Accepting the imperial government's
declaration of its abandonment of the
policy which has so seriously menaced
the. good relations between the two
countries, the government of the Uni
ted States will rely upon a scrupulous
execution henceforth of the now alt
ered policy of the imperial govern
ment such as will remove the principal
danger to an interruption of the good
relations existing between the United
States and Germany.
Not Contingent Uoon Othe Diplomatic
' Negotiations.
The government of the United States
feels it necessary to state that ft
takes it for granted that the imperial
German government does not intend to
imply that the maintenance of its
newly announced policy is in any way
contingent upon the course or result
of diplomatic negotiations between the
government of the United States and
any other belligerent government, not
withstanding the fact that certain
passages in the imperial government's
note of the fourth instant might ap
pear to be susceptible of that con
strnctjpn. In order, however, to
avoid any possible misunderstanding
the government of the United States
notifies the imperial government that
it cannot for a moment entertain,
much less discuss a suggestion that
respect by German naval authorities
for the rights of citizens of the Uni
ted States upon the high seas should in
any way or in the slightest degree be
made contingent upon the conduct of
any other government affecting the
rights.of neutrals and non-combatants.
Responsibility in such matters is sin
gle, not joint, absolute, not relative.
Statement by Secretary Lansing.
Mr. Lansing's statement, made public
after the note was on its way to Berlin,
follows:
"The greater part of the German
answer is devoted to matters which
this government cannot wiscuss with
the German government. The only
questions of right which can be dis
cussed with that government are those
arising out of its action or out of our
own, and in no event those questions
which are the subject of diplomatic
exchanges between the United 6tates
and any other country.
"The essence of the answer is that
Germany yields to our representations
in regard to the rights of merchant
ships and non-combatants on the high
seas and engages to observe the recog
nized rules ot international law gov
erning naval warfare in using her sub
marines against merchant ships. So
long as she lives up to this altered
policy we can have no reason to quar
rel with her on that score, though the
losses resulting from the violation of
American rights by German submarine
commanders operating under the for
mer, policy will have to be settled.
"While our difficulties with Great
Britain cannot form a subject of dis
cussion with Germany, it should be
stated that in our dealings with the
British government we are acting as
we are unquestionably bound to act
in view of the explicit, treaty engage
ments with that government. We have
treaty obligations as to the manner in
which matters in dispute between the
two governments are to be handled.
We offered to assume mutually similar
obligations with Germany, but the of
fer was declined. When, however, the
subject in dispute is a continuing
menace to American lives it is doubt
ful whether such obligations apply un
less the menace is removed during the
pendency of the proceedings.
The treaty with the British govern
ment referred to is the convention ne
gotiated by former Secretary Bryan,
under which the two nations agree that
any dispute arising shall be submitted
to an investigating commission for one
year before entering into " hostilities.
An offer to enter into such a treaty
for Germany brought a request for in
formation, but formal negotiations
never were instituted.- -
