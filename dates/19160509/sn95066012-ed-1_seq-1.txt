O'CLOCK THIS
Torpedoed White Star liner Went
Down Off Irish Coast
LOADED WITH WAR MUNITIONS
Steamer Carried Crew cf 110 Five of
Whom are Reported To Have
Been Lost.
London, May 9. The Cymric sank
at 3 o'clock this morning while at
tempting to reach an Irish port. Five
of the crew of 10,0 are reported to have
been lost. A dispatch from Liverpool
says that the crew of the Cymric are
being landed at Bantry bay, Ireland.
London, May 8. The 13,000-ton
White Star liner Cymric, recently en
gaged in freight service, has been tor
pedoed by a German submarine, ac
cording td advices received here.
One report says the Cymric was at
tacked in the Atlantic the White Star
company at Liverpool understands the
vessel was torpedoed about noon to
day.
Tho Cymric left New York April 29,
with an enormous cargo of war muni
tions. As it usually makes the voyage
lrom New York to Liverpool in ten
days, the ship was within a day or two
of its destination.
It is regarded as prcbable, in the
absence of definite details, that the
disaster occurred off the west coast of
Ireland, but whether on the northerly
or southerly route cannot bo stated.
The fate of the Cymric is not yet
known, although an early message re
ceived in London reported it was sink
ing.
I'he crew aboard numbered about
100 men, but no passengers were car
ried. y
There is no word of the fate of the
crew.
The Cymric was for years in the
usscngcr service between New York
and. English ports. It was 585 feet
long and 64 leet beam. It was built in
Belfast in 1898
New York. May 8. Officials of the
White Star line today said the Cym
ric's cargo included the usual amount
of war supplies carried by the line's
freighters.
Captain F. E. Beadnell, commanding
tho Cymric formerly commanded the
Adriatic, .Majestic and other White
Star vessels.
The manifest of tho Cymric dis-
lossea that it had on board 101 cases
of rifles and other firearms; 590 cases
of 'prjmers; 11,049 cases of empty
shells; 8,000 cases of cartridges; forty
cases of parts cf aeroplanes; 400 reels
of barbed wire; twenty cases of gun
parts; slx cases of bayonets; 220 cases
of fuae head and 0.720 cases of fuses.

ALL DELEGATES AT LARGE
Only One Convention to Make Selec
tions for Chicago.
Montpeaer, .May 9. All doubt as
to the method by which the republl
can delegates to the republican na
tional convention to be held in Chica-
go June 7 w ill be elected has been
dispelled as the result of the an
nouncement of the republican state
committee to the effect that there will
be only one convention, a state con
vention, to be convened at Montpelier
i Friday, May 26, at 10 o'clock in the
forenoon, when eight delegates and
eight alternates to the national con
vention will be elected' and the report
of tho committees on resolutions will
be acted upon. Former Lleut-Gov.
Frank E. Howe of Bennington, will
be the temporary chairman and the
Hon. C. H. Darling of Burlington, will
be chairman of the committee on res
olutions. This marks the end of the old sys
tem of electing district delegates at
district conventions, and four dele
gates at large known as the "big four"
at a state convention. Previously
the first and second congressional dis
tricts elected in their own convention
two delegates and two alternates
each. The wording of the new prim
ary law makes it possible to hold only
one convention.
Cities and towns will be represent
ed In the state convention by dele-
ates elected on the basis of one dele
gate for each city and town and one
additional delegate for each 100 votes
nd each fraction of 100 votes exceed
ing 50 cast for tho republican can
didate for governor at the state elec
tion of 1914. Figuring on this basis,
there will be 611 delegates in the
convention if all attend with 306
necessary for a choice. The represen
tatives by counties is as follows:
Addison 49
Bennington 40
Caledonia 43
hittenden 51 1

Total 611
The official call designates May 16
as the day on which caucuses are to
be held for the election of delegates
to the state convention. This is also
presidential primary day. Notices of
the caususes are to be published by
local republican committees not later
than May 10. Delegates elected at the
caucuses should provide themselves
with credentials to be presented to the
epublican state committee at the
headquarters in the Pavilion hotel im
mediately on their arrival at Montpe
lier to attend the convention. A du
plicate credential should also be mail
ed to the secretary of the state com
mittee, J. Rolfe Searles. St. Johns
bury. Immediately after the caucus to
aid in expediting the work of making
up the roll of the convention.
The state committee points out that
nder the new primary law there
probably will be no caucuses held this
ear after those on May 16 and that
therefore it would be well if town and
committees be elected at tho com
ing caucuses to take office immed
iately on their election. .
On the basis fixed by tho state
committee the several towns in Ben

U.S. SENDS KEW NOTE TO BERLIN
President Expects Imperial Govern
ment to Carry Out New Sub
marine Policy
Washington, May 9. Following is
the text of the note cabled yesterday
)y Secretary Lansing to Embassador
Gerard at Berlin, with instructions to
deliver it to the German minister of
foreign affairs:
"The note of the Imperial German
government under date of May 4, 191C,
has received careful consideration by
the government of the United States.
It is especially noted, as indicating the
purpose of the imperial government as
to the future, that it is prepared to
do its utmost to contine the operation
of the war for the rest of Its duration
to the fighting forces of the belliger
ents', and that it is determined to im
pose upon all its commanders at sea
the limitations of the recognized, rules
of international law upon which the
government of the United States has
Insisted.
"Throughout the months which have
elapsed since the Imperial government
announced on February 4, 1915, its
submarine policy, now happily aban
doned, the government of the United
States has been constantly guided and
restrained by motives of friendship in
its patient efforts to bring to an
amicable settlement the critical ques
tions arising from that policy. Ac
cepting the imperial government's
declaiation of Its abandonment of the
policy which has 60 seriously menaced
the good relations between the two
countries, the government of the Unit
ed States will rely upon a scrupulous
execution henceforth of the now alter
ed policy of the imperial government
such as will remove the principal dan
ger to an interruption of the good re
lations existing between the United
States and Germany.
"The government of the United
States feels It necessary to state that
It takes it for granted that the imperi
al German government does not intend
to imply that the maintenance of its
newly-announced policy is in any way
contingent upon the course or result
of diplomatic negotiations between the
government of the United States and
any other belligerent government, not
withstanding the fact that certain pas
sages in the imperial government's
note cf the 4th instant might appear to
be susceptible of that construction. In
order, however, to avoid any possible
misunderstanding, the government of
the United States notifies the imperial
government that it cannot for a mom
ent entertain, much less discuss, a sug
gestion that respect by German naval
authorities for the rights or citizens of
the United States upon the high seas
should In any way or in the slightest
degree be made contingent upon the
conduct of any other government af
fecting the rights of neutrals nnd non
combatants. Responsibility in such
matters is single, not joint; absolute,
uot relative."

FURIOUS FIGHTING
CONTINUES Oil
VERDUN FRONT
Four German Attacks on 2,000-
Yard Line
TEUTONS AFTER HILL 304
Crown Prince Used Four Different
Prussian Regiments in saults
on Position.
Paris, May 8. Furious fighting con
tinued laHt night and today on the
Verdun front and especially In the
region of Hill 304 on the west of the
Meusc.
Severe attacks by the Germans near
the hill during the night were repulsed
by the French, according to the War
Oliice bulletin this afternoon, and In
a counter offensive the French drove
the Crown Prince's troops out of a
communication trench which they had
captured In the day time.
Today a terrific bombardment was In
progress along this whole front, but a
German attack, directed against Hill
87, west of Hill 304, was stopped by
the French curtain of fire.
The Geiman objective in this region
is the ravine between Hill 304 and
Dead Man Hill. In renewing their at
tack before Verdun after seventy-seven
days of buttle with a violence rivaling
that of early March, the Germans fol
lowed the Napoleonic policy of at
tempting to turn what could not be car
ried by frontal attack. With a whole
army corps they made an assault by
way of the ravine in an attempt to
crush in the French line along a front
of one and one-half miles. The ground
there is favorable lor an attack and the
weakness of the position, put one of
his best trained army corps at that
place. This corps disposed of the
first attack without ceding any impor
tant ground, but the battle is still rag
ing there.
On the east of the Meuse also there
was fighting of much violence last
night. In making their gains yester-
lay the Germans delivered four attacks
on a front of 2.001) yards, between
Haudromont Wood nnd Fort de Dou
ailment, each advance being made by
a different Prussian regiment.
!n their counter offensive at night.
according to the War Oltlce bulletin,
tho French drove the Germans out of
a trench south of Haudromont, which
they had just occupied, and captured
thirty men, including two oillcers.
