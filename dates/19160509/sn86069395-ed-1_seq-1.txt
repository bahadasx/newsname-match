President Juan Jiminez, of Santo

One of the soldiers killed in the

died at Columbus, N. M., ten days

regarded as unsatisiaciory. in lis con
cessions and sneering in its tone.
President Wilson has refused to
withdraw the nomination of Louis D.
Brandeis for Supreme Court Justice,
and will press for early confirmation.
Few men have ever been subjected
to such opposition as Brandeis. The
defeat of his confirmation will be a
triumph for "the interests."
The storm of protest raised all over
the world against the summary exe
cution of Irish rebels, has called a halt
after tho slaughter of nine of the lead
ers. Many others given death sen
tences, including Countess Markie-
muted to imprisonment for terms
ranging from three years to life. The
number of civilians killed during the
fighting was 160 so far as known and
32 soldiers were reported as killed.
Eight of the leaders of tho Irish re-
bellion have been executed and the
folly of Pearse's attempt to start trou-
ble with a few hundred men is now
apparent to" all. About all that was
accomplished was the destruction of
$10,000,000 of private property in
Dublin. This of itself made the up
rising unpopular at home. There
are 150,000 Irish sbldiers in the
trenches and it is reported that when
the Germans-displayed a sign inviting 'wwer, that the only matter dis
them to desert their trenches during , ffd was the bandit raid at Glenn
the Dublin revolt, that the Irish band , SPr"?' . , ,
of its own accord struck

A break In tho diplomatic relations

A"bny was" postponed, if not averted,
by the German reply to the American
note in regard to tho U-boat warfare.
It was authoritatively stated in Wash
ington Saturday that if the official text
of tho note bore out the assurance
that the orders to submarine
com-
manders had been revised so as
end tho warfare against unarmed
v. .
rchant vessels it undoubtedly
uld bo accepted in good faith by
Washington Government. Tho belief
expressed in Washington is that if tho
reply is accepted as sufficient, ne
answer will be necessary, but tho fu
ture conduct of Germany's undersea
warfare will determine whether fur
ther action by the- United States is
necessary. CtowietsJwrnal.

j
Tragedy Foiiows When Men
Meet On Main
Street.
Cadiz, Ky., May 8. Eugene Wil
son shot and instantly killed Lee
Humphries on Main street here at 4
o'clock Saturday p. m. The shooting
was without prelude in the way of
words, it is alleged, Wilson stepping
up to Humphries and began firing.
The tragedy occurred just outside Mc
carty's drug store. Following the
first shot Humphries, who is said to
have been unarmed, ran into the
store. Wilson fired twice more after
Humphries got inside. All the bul
lets went true and Humphries fell
dead on the floor. He fell between
William Dunn and Dug Crute, who
narrowly escaped being shot. Wilson
was arrested.
There had been trouble of long
standing between the men. A few
weeks ago Wilson filed suit for $5,000
as damages against Humphries, charg
ing the latter with having alienated
his wife's affections.
Humphries was an influential farm
er and unmarried.
Wilson was arrested before the
third report of his pistol had died out.
Deputy Sheriff Charley Humphries, a
distant relative of the dead man, was
next door to the drug store and he
ran out and seized. Wilson.- The lat
ter submitted quietly and was imme
diately taken to jail.
He has made no statement regard
ing the affair. The shooting, taking
place in the heart of the business sec
tion, just across the street from the
courthouse, created an intense excite
ment. Public sentiment seems to lean to
Humphries, than whom there was no
more popular or highly respected
citizen of the county. He is survived
by his brother, George Humphries,
andean unmarried sister, with whom
lie made his home.
LOUISVILLE RELATIVE
He was also an uncle of Adrian C.
Humphries, prominent young attor
ney of Louisville. It is said that for
the past three or four months Mrs.
Wilson and her three or four chil
dren have been making their home
with her mother, a widow, who lives
near this place. Neither Wilson nor
Humphries had ever been involved in
any serious trouble before. Humph
ries was a member or the Woodmen
of the World Lodge, and the funeral
services, which took place at the
Humphries family burying gronud
Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock, were
conducted by the Cadiz Lodge of
that order.

Kffi MUSIC
In Public Schools to be Dis
cussed By Miss Bour-
gard.
An effort is being made by the
musical interests of IIopkinsviIIe,to
have the systematic study of music
madoja part of the work in all grades
of tho public schools and to this end
they have invited Miss Caroline Bour
gard, Supervisor of Music in the
Louisville Public Schools, to visit
Hopkinsville and tell of the methods
adopted by the progressive cities of
the country.
Miss Bourgard will come to Hop
kinsville on Wednesday and will on
Thursday morning go before the sec
ond and third grades of the schools
and give demonstrations in ear train
ing and sight reading. Thursday
night she will talk at the First Chris
tian church, explaining the methods
adopted in Louisville and by many
other up-to-date cities. She will tell
just how music is taught to little tots
and give the steps of advancement as
children go from grade to grade.
Miss Bourgard is thoroughly familiar
with her work and the talk she will
make Thursday night will be of much
interest to the patrons of tho schools.
Where music has been a study in
other cities it has been invaluable to
many noted singers who without hes
itation say they attribute their success
to the beginning made in the Idwer
grades of the public schools.
The talk by Miss Bourgard at the
Christian church is for the purpose of
informing school patrons of the good
results to be attained and to interest
all citizens who have the schools at
heart in the moyement to have the
Board of Trustees consider the em
ployment of a Supervisor of Music
In addition to the talk to be made
by Miss Bourgard a program will be
rendered by the High School Orches
tra and an opportunity will be had to
hear this organization in one of the
best efforts made this season.

Learning to Walk.

suffered a broken neck in a fall three
months ago, is learning to walk
again. He is permitted to take one
or two steps each day now, but if his

will be allowed to make longer walks
on crutches.

NEW OFFENSIVE

Germans Launch Great Attack
and French Admit Gains
in Two Places.
RUSSIAN TRANSPORT LOST

Germans of
ing British Submarine is
Denied by London.
Paris, May 8. In fierce .attacks on
both banks of the Mouse today, the
German forces gained ground from
the French. They entered the French
communicating trenches cast of Hill
304 and gained a footing in the first
French linebeween Haudomont wood
and Fort Dourumont, over an extent
of nearly a third of a mile.
London, May 8. What seemingly
is a new great offensive with its ob
jective the capture of Verdun, has
been launched by the Germans north
east and northwest of the fortress
In both sectors gains for the Germans
are chronicled in the latest French
official communication.
Except near Hill 304, however, the
entire attack, which was thrown
ifgainst the sector between Hill 304
and Le Mort Homme, was repulsed
with serious losses to the Germans. A
similar fate befell the attacking forces
in the northeast, except in the region,
of the Haudomont wood. Both at
tacks were delivered after heavy pre-
paraiury uuinuarumenis.
Aside from these attacks only bom
bardments have been in progress on
the line in France and Belgium. The
artillery action lias been extremely
heavy in the Woevre and at the foot
of the Meuse hills, in the region east
of Verdun.
Russian torpedo boats have ineffect
ually shelled German positions on the
northeast coast of Courland, accord
ing to Berlin. In Galicia, along the
lower Stripa river, the Russians have
made a further advance against the
Teutons, while in the Caucasus region
Turkish attacks in the Black sea lit
toral were repulsed. The Turks, who
had been contesting the advance of
the Russians toward Bagdad in the
Serinalkerind region, have retreated
hastily after having sustained heavy
losses, leaving behind them their
tents and war material.
Small infantry encounters at various
points along the Austro-Italian front,
in which what advantage there was
rested with the Italians, have served
to vary the usual fighting with tho
big guns.
The sinking of an allied transport
in tho Mediterranean late in April
with the loss of nearly all 600 Russian
troops who were on board is report
ed in advices from Corfu, says tho
Overseas News agency.
The transport was sunk by striking;
a mine about the time the battleship
Russell met a similar fate, the advices
state.
The news agency says only a few
were rescued. The bodies recovered
were buried by the British at M.dta.
The British official communication
admits the loss of two naval aero
planes, but denies the German cl tan
of the sinking of submarine E-Jl,
which is declared to have returned
safely to its base.
