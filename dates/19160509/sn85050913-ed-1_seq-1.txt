Supreme Court Sustains lower Court
in an Interesting Case Appeal-
ed From Hamilton
County.
A VICTORY FOR DRAINAGE
Constitutionality of law Attacked
by the Railroad—Albrook was
Judge Hoe.
The supreme court has just hand
ed down an opinion of more than or
dinary interest, involving the consti
tutionality of certain features of the
drainage laws of Iowa. The case was
brought by the Chicago & North
western Railroad Company against
the board of supervisors of Hamilton
county and drainage district No. 137.
The company appealed from the find
ings of the board of appraisers and
the case wa6 tried before Judge Al
brook in the district court here in
the fall of 1914. Judge Albrook, in
rendering his decision, took new and
advanced ground and his opinion
created much comment all over the
state and lawyers were somewhat ir
ritated at his conclusions. He held
that the railroad company was bene
fitted by the reclainiation of land, as
it would secure more freight from a
cultivated field than from a swamp
of the spme size. That, of course, is
self-evident, but many attorneys
held that the court had no authority
to take cognizance of such. benefits.
The constitutionality of certain feat
ures of the law were also attacked
in Judge Albrook's court here. At
torney Blake went to Des Moines
and argued the case for the county
before the supreme court and is nat
urally pleased over the verdict ren
dered.

A distressing and shocking acci
dent 'occurred Saturday atfobt 10
o'clock on Second street directly in
front of the F. C. Ruegnlts home
near Broadway and Second streets,

car driven by D. E. Stynn of Fort

eye, bruises of the body and possibly
internal injuries.
The accident as given by an eye
witness was substantially as fol
lows: The little lad was going north
on Broadway walking slowly, eat
ing from a bag of candy in his hand,
when all at once as he reached the
corner he started to run across Sec
ond street, directly in front of t^te
car, without looking to see if the
road was clear. The car driven by
Mr. Mann was going east and the
child was struck by the auto,
knocked down and run over by one
wheel. The brakes were immediate
ly set and the machine stopped be
fore the rear wheel ran Over the it
tie fellow.
Mr. Mann jumped out. picked up
the boy and took him at once to a
physician's office where his wounds
were dressed.
According to the eye witneSB, no
blame attaches to the driver of the
automobile, who was not golqg at a
high rate of speed, and did all that
a driver could do when such a situa
tion so suddenly confronts hitn.
Remodel Residence.
The Dr. A. Kellogg residence on
