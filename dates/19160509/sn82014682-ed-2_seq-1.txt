the fact that 'Hawaii's guard la ready

" Guard officers here point out that
while the men are ready and willing
to go, it Is not likely that the military
policy at Washington would favor call

news of this sort would bring rejoic

. News that the President had called
out the militia of three states caused
various bits of speculation at army
and guard headauarters today. It is
the general belief that the troops un
der this call wiu not cross tne line
and go Into tie Interior of Mexico,
but will rather be used for border
duty, being stationed along the line
in small towns and rellevinr the reg

PRESIDENTIAL
WOOD IS HERE
Proposed to Nominate High
Army Officer as Republi

The boom for Gen. Leonard Wood as
Republican candidate for president has
reached Hawaii
Several .other booms and boomlets
have come here In Che past few
months. Friends of Senator Burton,
Congressman Mann, Elihu Root

have written here to get a line on the'
island situation, and a good deal of lit

Hawaii doesn't get a chance to vote
in: the national elections and so far
Hawaii Isn't sore of a chance to vote
la the Republican convention which
will nominate the G. O. P. candidate.
If the Hawaii delegation' of two Is
seated with the right to vote, the ter
ritory can "cut some Ice" In Chicago,
but not much otherwise.
Nevertheless, the political powers
in their national campaigns look to
Hawaii to do something for the cause
in the way of contributions to the
war chest at least and the men back
of the variou8candidatea have been
getting busy some time since to get
what help they can in the territdry.
John A. Stewart of 233 Broadway,
New York, chairman of the incipient
Wood movement, has sent letters to
men - In Hawaii who supposedly can
assist the boom The following ex
tracts from a circular letter evidently
being widely distributed in the States

German
Drive at Verdun Tremendous
PARIS, France, May 9. What appears to be a most determined
effort on the part of the German troops at Verdun to break through
the French positions is now in progress. Huge masses of heavy ex
plosives are hurled constantly at the French positions, and infantry
attacks are being made with a desperate determination which indi
cates that the Germans have been ordered to accomplish the fall
of the French this point. : ' ;
After some initial successes at Hill 304, which is between Douau
mout and Haudremont, the Germans were repulsed by the French;
suffering heavy losses. The French by a series of counter-attacks
drove the Germans from certain positions east of the Meuse. ' '

cesses today on the Verdun front.; They took several trenches south
of Haucourt, holding their positions and capturing nearly 400 prison
ers. The enemy 's , losses n killed were . very heavy, V v I
Earlier despatches from London say that it is believed in welt
informed military quarters that the Kaiser contemplates the aston?
ishiiig feat of a double-barreled offensive in the west, massed legions
being hurled simultaneously against the French at Verdun and
against the British forces on the western sections of the front.
...To this end it is reported that 800,000 German troops have
beeti mobilized behind the lines facing the English, while despatched
froMAmsterdam state that 500,000 fresh troops have been concen
trated on the Verdun front, the German general staff having resolved
td throw in every. resource in an effort to capture the great Meuse
fortress before Whitsunday, June.ll. This great force of 1,300,000
men is said to include the new army of 1916 and troops withdrawn
