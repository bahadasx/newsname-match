command into Mexico.
Died in Effort to Warn Friends.
Four Americans at Tramway Cross
ing, near the border, were reported
to have eluded the bandits in delayed
dispatches to the state department to
day. No doubt remained, : however,
that L. Coy gave his life in a futile ef
fort to warn the Porto Rico de Boquil

came separated from the party that
set out for the international line and
his body is reported to have been
found with the throat cut. .
C. G. Compton, at first reported
killed, arrived here in a motor truck
with Private Tyree, also reported cap
ture, and Corporal Smith, and told a
vivid story of the raid :
"I was awakened Friday night by
cavalry marching past my home,"
said Compton. "I peered out of my
bedroom window and saw about 7u
Mexicans riding in groups toward the
settlement. Two drew handkerchiefs
about their faces and rode up to my
door to ask if any American soldiers
resided with ns. I told them only my
family lived there and they asked the
way to the camp.
Fled With Children.
"By this time the advance Mexicans
had reached the town and the shoot
ing began. The pair leaped upon their
horses and rode up to the fight. I
heard shouting and rifle fire and took
my place at the window with my own

they awoke and started crying and I
lost my nerve. I could not stand be
ing still any longer. Seizing Louise
in my arms, I ran to the home of a
Mexican washer woman and left her
there. Things were pretty lively by
this time. The wax factory was blaz
ing, lighting up the whole town."

Points Out Responsibility Is
Single, "ot Joint.
Washington, May 9. America's
latest note to Germany on the subma
rine controversy had gone forward to
Berlin today and administration offi
cials were interested in knowing
whether Germany would make any re
ply. It was intimated in German cir
cles that the imperial government
might. not consider an answer neces
sary. The text of the note made public
last night shows the United States in
cepts the German promises that subma
rine warfare in the future will be ar
ranged to conform with rules of inter
national law. It insists, however, that
Germany must not consider her re
spect for rights of American citizens
on the high seas as contingent on the
conduct of any other belligerent with
whom the United States may be nego
tiating. "Responsibility in such .natters is
single, not joint; absolute, not rela
tive." Text of the Note.
Following is the text of the note
