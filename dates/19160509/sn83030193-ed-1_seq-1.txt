ini'tif I'StKil 1"" Hi"1 Allan Powder
Company four woikmcn wore
hilled and none Injured.
Early reports stated that from !0
to 100 portions were injured, bill those
proved unfounded.
Fire followed thu explosion, and
blazing brands, borne on a fifty-mile
Kale from the went, were carried for
miles over a country literally doited
with powder and dynamite mills aii'l
stoi chouses. Window panes wore
shattered all aiound Lake Hopntcm;
and as far away ns Dover, which is
nine miles distant. The shock of the
explosion wns felt throughout the
mountain districts of Northern New
Jersey and the sound was plainly
heard in the skyscrapers of downtown
Manhattan.
The plant nf the Atlas Powder
Company consists of scores of low,
loosely 'built structures scattered
over 600 ncres of land. At tho lower
end of the lnke wns the dynamite
plant and storage houses. One of the
units of this plant was a tank used
for tho storage of nitro-Klycerlne.
Survivors say the tank exploded
nnd that the concussion set off two
of the dynamite storage housos. Thu
Alius offtelnta say there were two
explosion. Others stnto there wero
three explosions, tho most violent
marking tho destruction of the tank,
the other two, coming almost to
gather, representing the explosion of
the dynamite in the. two storage
houses, wnlch was set off by concus
tdon. The other unit, a storage house,
vrii destroyed by the fire which
spread after the main explosion.
The first report to reach Paterson,
Worrlrtown, Dover, noonton and other
towns la the powder mill district
placed tha number of dead at more
than fifty and tho number of IJured at
awveral hundred. Aa It was known
thit (00 er mora persons were em

bulance available was sent to tho foot
of Lake Hopatcong. The most seri
ously Injured were taken to Dover and
Morrlstown and the others were
treated at emergency hospitals estab
' Ilshed in residence nnd hotels around
the lake.
Tor a time the fire, fanned by the
gale, threatened the whole lower end
of the Atlaa plant, but tho Arc-right-lng
force of the company wis quickly
rallied after the panic following the
explosions and threatened buildings
were saved. In order to guard
against a wholo powder plnnt going

All the rest of the crew wero saved.
Tho Cymric carried no passengers.
Tho big liner floated eleven hours
aftor tho torpedo hit her, and she wns
virtually abandoned at the time she
started to go down. Several rescue
vessels had gone to her nld.
The survivors were landed on tho
shore of llantry Hay this afternoon.
Apparently tho attack on the Whlto
Star liner wiu mado without warn
ing. It was pointed out, however,
that oven if thin woro so tho fact
would not offer proof that U-boat
commanders wero not keeping faith
with America. Now Instructions have
beon issued to thn Gern an submarine
commandors In accordance with Ger-
man pledges to the United Stntos, but
It Is quite possible that tho U-boat
which attacked tho Cymric left Its
base before tho new order was ro-
celvod.
Ql'HKNSTOWN, May 9. American

Judge Howe Heeds Jury's Plea
for Mercy in Daeche's
Case.

Writ of Error Granted to Him
Fay and Scholz Sent
Back to Tombs.
Lieut. Robert Fay, the deserter from
jfcf.aMTBMnArmr. to-day was sen
tenced to a term of eight yeara In the
Federal Penitentiary at Atlanta, and
Walter Scholti, his brother-ln-la-w,
and Paul Daeche, a German reservist,
his two accomplices, were sentencod
to four and two yenrs Imprisonment
respectively, for conspiracy to dlsablo
ships carrying war munitions to the
allies. In addition to tho prison term
each was fined $1 on each of tho two
Indictments undor which they were
found guilty. The first Indictment
charged conspiracy to despoil tho
owners of ships nnd cargoes, thu sec
ond to despoil the Insurance under
writers.
In pronouncing sentence, United
States Judge Harland H. Howe scored
Fav nnd Scholz without reservation.
In Daeche's case he was obviously
guided by thu strong recommenda
tion for mercy the Jury had mado.
Fay received his sentence with tho
assumed stoicism which has marked
his demeanor throughout the trial.
Ho was very palo and hnd all he
could do to keep himself in hand.
Tho com (room was crowded nnd the
corridor without wnH filled for an hour

As soon as sentence wns pro

been at liberty. Fay and Scholz were
taken baik to tho Tombs. Writs of
error will be Mel for them within a
few da and an attempt will be
nude to obtain ball In their behalf.
United States Attorney H. Snow
den Marshall, In addressing the Court,
snld that he would niako no recom
mendation as to the length of term of
Imprisonment, but nuked that a
severe sentence be Imposed In order
to convoy the lesson that none of tho
belligerent nations nro to bo per
mitted to conduct their wurfaio from
this country.
"The laws which havu been vio
lated by these defondunts," hu raid,
"arc those which protect tho ships of
frlondly nations, tho same
general
laws which protect tno Merman snips
now lying Interned In our harbor, I
consider Fay an ngent of his govern

that in future It lncreai.es the real
danger of conspiracy In this country
