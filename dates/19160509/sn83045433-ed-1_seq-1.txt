The number of prisoners taken is placed

The capture of Hill No. 304 gives the
German artillery a clear sweep against
the Paris-Verdun railway, some four
miles to the southward, and imperils the
French positions at Dead Man's Hill, two
miles to the east. The German strategy
aims at forcing a French retirement from'
the Deadman region, by a turning move

Lower Chamber Adopts Plan Author
izing $20.000.000 for Erection of
Vast Nitrate Plant.
Efforts to bridge the gap that exists
between the House and Senate on the
subject of military preparedness failed
in the Lower Chamber yesterday.
The House rejected the provision in the
Senate bill for a standing army of 250.000
men by a vote of -t to 141.
It rejected the Senate provision for a
volunteer army by a vott of !1 to 109.
It approved a substitute for the Ben
ate provision for the erection of a ni
trate plant. This authorizes the Presi
dent to determine the most economical
means of manufacturing nitrates and au
thorizes t20 00.000 for the erection of a
plant. Surplus nitrates not required by
the army and navy may be d mond of
to farmerp in he form of fertiliser. en
larglpg the goveramae owarep as
pect of the undertaking. 1
The voting as well as the general de

strong sectional differences of opinion
among members of the House an to the
degree of preparedness demanded by the
xisting situation and the methods which
it was to be achieved.

Representative Hay, chairman of the
Military Affairs Committee, and cham
pion of the militia plan of providing a
national defense force, Inveighed against
the proposed Increase of the standing
army and the proposed volunteer army
as well.
The most strenuous fight occurred over
the proposal for the establishment of a
nitrate plant. When this was reached
Representative Hay proposed the substi
ute for the Senate provision. This au
horizes the President to make an in
vestigatlon of the possibilities and pro
:esses of nitrate manufacture and to
rhoose the most satisfactory site for a
plant.
Representative Lenroot offered a sub
stitute providing that a commission
should make an investigation and report
!o Congress before the building of a
plant was undertaken. This was defeated
by a vote of 1I to 194.
Representative Mondell, of Wyoming.
then proposed a substitute cutting out the
appropriation altogether and provIdIng
for an investigation of the nitrate propo
