MEXICANS FLEE
AFTER NEW RAID
.S.
Bandits Attack Texas Town,
Kill Three Soldiers and
Boy in Battle
VILLA MAY HAVE

Event Not to Cut Much of
Figure in Conference
Over Withdrawal
Alpine, Tex. May 8.—Fleeing
through the wild mesas of northeri
Coahuila, the sevtenty or more bandits
that raided the American settlement
of Glenn Springs and Boquillas, last
Friday, killing three cavalrymen and
a 9-yearold boy, ftre believed to be
heading into the interior today, many
miles from the scene of their depre
dation.
A posse from Marathon and detach
ment of twenty-three troopers of the
fourteenth cavalry are said to have
followed the trail of the Mexicans into
Coahuila, while other reports have it
that the Americans have not forded
the Rio Grande ninety-five miles from
here but are waiting at the river for
reinforcements. Capt. Caspar Cole is
hurrying to Boquillas to take com
mand while two companies of the four
teenth cavalry and a machine gun
company are expected here or at Mar
athon this afternoon when they will
head southward to the Big Bend coun
try. It is not known here whether
the new troops contemplate along pur
stilt of the bandits into Mexico or
will be placed as an additional guard
along the border. Reports here say
there are many bandits operating be
tween Boquillas and Presidio, Just
south of the Rio Grande.
Bandits Have Start.
It is about a three days' march
from either Marathon or Alpine to the
Rio Grande and as the bandits already
have a three days' start, only a relent
less pursuit will bring the Americans
up with them.
Nothing has been heard of Private
Roscoe Tyree, who was last seen as
he ran from the adobe house where
he and his eight companions for three
long hours fought against the Mexicans
and then lied because the roof of the
house was set aflame by fireballs.
Private Croskem, who was In the
light, thinks that Tyree was wounded
and wandered off In the hills where
he died. Others believe that Tyree
was captured and carried oft a prison
er by the bandits and probably killed
later.
Unconfirmed information says that
J. Deetner, the storekeeper at Boquil
las, has been found dead on the Mex
ican side with
hlB
throat cut. His
clerk, named Compton, is known to
have been a captive of the bandits.
He Is thought to have suffered the
same fats as Deemer.
Civilians Escape.
There were only a few Americans
in Glenn Springs and Boquillas at the
time of the raid and the bandits ap
parently made no effort to locate
them. They escaped Into bills when
the shooting started.
Several women are known to be
living on the scattered ranches in the
Big Bend country but there is nothing
to indicate that they have been mo
lested. The Mexican employes of the
Ellis Wax factory In Glenn Springs
were not molested.
The bodies of the three soldiers
killed in the Glenn Springs raid, Wil
liam Cohen, Stephen J. Coloe and
Hudson Rogers, will be sent to their
homes today. The body of the Comp
ton boy has been taken to Marathon.
A track driver, Champ Woods, yester
day reported miBslng, is safe.
Woman Tell* of Raid.
Mrs. W. K. Ellis and her husband,
whose wax factory was destroyed by
the Mexicans, had narrow escapes.
Mrs. Ellis was the only woman in
Glenn Springs when the bandits
swooped down upon the little settle
ment near midnght. In the flickering
lights of the burning buildings, she
and her husband stole out of their
house and fled in safety to the hills,
-where they wandered around until
morning.
Telling her friends in Marathon,
where she is resting today of her ex
perience, Mrs. Ellis said:
"A fusillade of shots roused my hjis
band and myself. Peering out of the
window, we saw the forms of men
moving in the direction of the soldiers'
little camp.
"The flashes of their rifles were like
lightning streaks against the dark
Hess and we knew there must be a
number of Mexicans attacking the
place. Mr. Ellis told me not to strike
qa match or make any light for fear of
attracting the attention of the bandits.

LEAD CHARGE ON
SCORE OF REDSKINS FIGURE
PROMINENTLY IN RECENT
VICTORY OF CAVALRY.
Field headquarters near Namiquipa,
Chihuahua, May 7.—By wireless to
Columbus, N. M., May 8.—Twenty war
mad Apache trailers took a prominent
part in the recent battle at Ojo-Azules,
according to reports brought here to
day by officers.
The engagement Is the flrst in
Which the Indians, brought here re
cently from the White Mountain reser
vation of Arizona, have participated.
Shrieking shrill, weird warhoops,
the trailers rode at the head of the
charging troopers of the eleventh cav
alry as they swept through the town.
.They demonstrated their marksman
ship with six shooters, killing a large
number of the flfty-flve Mexican vic
tims.
The defeat of the Mexicans was
complete.
Two Carranza soldiers from the
Bmall garrison at Quicoche arriving
at the American camp at San Antonio
last Thursday evening gave Gen. J. J.
Pershing, the expeditionary command
er, the flrst intimation of the pres
ence of the Villa bandits at Ojo
Azules. Gen. Pershing Immediately
ordered Maj. Robert L. Howze, with
six picked troops of cavalry, south
In pursuit
Poor guides delayed the column's
arrival at Ojo-Azules until daylight,
enabling a Villa sentry to discover
their approach and give the alarm.
MEXICANS DISHEARTENED.
Field headquarters, May 3.—By mo
tor truck to Columbus, N. M., May 8.—
The punitive expedition under Brig.
Gen. J. J. Pershing has accounted to
date for about 125 Villa bandits slain
and between two and three hundred
wounded. Meanwhile the Americans
lost six killed, a ratio of twenty ban
dits slain for every American life lost.
In wounded the bandits have suffered
nearly thirty casualties for every
American hit by a bullet.
While the expeditionary forces have
not lost one officer, the Villa men have
had half a dozen of their leaders
killed. The significance of this show
ing was that it was made against some
of the most desperate fighters In
Mexico, men whose reputations have
ranked high among the military men
produced by five years of Mexican
revolution.
More important than the numerous
bandits killed has been their complete
loss of morale. Nowhere will they
stand any longer to flght Americans.
A few shots from advantageous ground
and the bandits run, abandoning their
good positions before the Americans
are on equal terms.
MORE RANGERS ENLISTED.
Austin, Tex., May 8.—The state
ranger force is to be lnoreased by fifty
additional men at once and a call may
be issued for 100 additional rangers

Washington, D. C„ May 8. —A note
to Germany has practically been com
pleted and probably will go forward to
Berlin today. It will be made public
soon afterward. It is understood It
will be brief, informing Germany that
as long as the new Instructions to sub
marine commanders are observed dip
lomatic relations will be continued but
that the United States can not allow
Germany to dictate its negotiations
with Great Britain.
The president worked on the propos
ed communication early today follow
ing his conference with Secretary Lan
sing last night. It is understood offi
cials are so far agreed on the policy to
be pursued that it will not be neces
sary to wait for the cabinet meeting
tomorrow.
While the German note has averted
for the present at least a break in dip
lomatic relations, it was said today
that the president was not satisfied
with the apparent conditions attached
by Germany. The United States stands
by its demand that Germany cease her
attacks on vessels in violation of inter
national law, regardless of negotia
tions which may be carried on with
Great Britain over the food blockade.
Some of his advisers wanted him to
make no reply to the German note and
only wait developments but he is un
derstood to h&ve decided to. send the
new communication.

NEAR THE AZORES
INCOMING 8TEAMER AT NEW
YORK REPORT8 HAVING
BEEN CHASED AT SEA.
New York, May 8.—Capt. Guy Gaunt,
naval attache of the British embassy
at Washington, today Investigated the
report that two German commerce
raiders, accompanied by two subma
rines, are operating in the trans-At
lantic steamship lanes off the Azores
islands, about 1,800 miles from New
York. The story was brought here
yesterday by the steamship Venezia
of the Fabre line from Bordeaux.
Members of the crew said one of the
raiders fired several shots at the Ven
ezia on April 28 but was unable to
overtake her. The naval attache said
he intended to wire at once to Halifax
so that British cruisers now in Ameri
can waters would bd warned.
"They will know in Halifax if any
of our cruisers or auxiliary cruisers
are in the region reported by Capt.
Boniface," said Capt. Gaunt. "If these
are really German raiders escaped
from Kiel, they will have a short lease
of life. Undoubtedly there will be
great excitement in London when the
news reaches there that German raid
ers are loose again."
One of the men on the Venezia said
the vessel that flred on them flew no
flag and that -she was accbmpanled
by a larger vessel which in turn was
convoying the two submarines. The
larger of the raiders did not join In
the chase.

MAKE DESPERATE
ATTACK ON VERDUN
NEW AND POWERFUL ARMY 18
TRYIN0 TO BATTER DOWN
FRENCH DEFENSES.
Paris, May 8.—After seventy-seven
days of battle the Germans are mak
ing a new attack before Verdun with
another formidable army. Fighting
almost equal in violence to that of the
beginning of March is in progress on
both banks of the Meuse.
The principal effort of the Germans
is being directed against Dead Man
hill. Following the Napoleonic policy
of attempting to turn what can not be
carried by frontal attack, the Germans
with a whole army corps, made the
assault by way of the ravine between
Hill 304 and Dead Man hill, seeking
to crush in the French line along a
front of one and one-half miles. The
ground there is favorable for attack
and the French commander, aware of
the weakness of the position placed
one of his best trained army corps at
that place. This corps disposed of the
initial attack without ceding* any im
portant ground but the battle is still
raging and according to the latest ad
vices the result will not be known till
some time today.
East of the Meuse the Germans de
livered four attacks on a front of 2,000
yards, each advance being made by a
different Prussian regiment. The
fighting there is as fierce as on the
other side of the river and as Incon
clusive.
Gen. Nivelle, whose promotion to
the command at Verdun put him in
charge at such a critical time, is a
man of much ability. Gen. Nivelle is
one of the discoveries of the war. At
the outbreak of hostilities he was in
command of the fifth regiment of artil
lery. Gen. Joffre soon singled him out
for a leading role. He was promoted
to be general of brigade on October
24, 1914, and shortly after was placed
in command of the sixty-flrst infantry
division. On December 23, 1915, he
received his three stars and at the
same time was appointed commander
of the third army corps.
WAR 8UMMARY.
The artillery action has been very
heavy in the Woevre, in the region
east of Verdun.
In Galicia along the lower Stripa
river, the Russians have made further
advances against the Teutons.
The Russians advancing toward
Bagdad have repulsed the Turks who
retreated after sustaining heavy
losses.
Encounters along the Austro-Italian
front have resulted in small gain for
the Italians.
A transport with 600 Russians on
board has been sunk in the Mediter
ranean by striking a mine.
The Countess Markiecicz, one of the
leaders In the Irish revolt, was found
guilty by a court martial and sen
tenced to death but the sentence was
commuted to penal servitude for life.
LIBERTY IDELPDONEO
Leaders of the Filipinos Call on Presi

Washington, D. C., May 8.—Manuel
Quezon, Philippine commissioner, who
has been urging Philippine independ

he and his followers had abandoned
the idea of freedom in the near future
and hoped congress would pass the
house bill giving a greater share of
self government to the islands but set
ting no date for independence.
Mr. Quezon urged the president to
support the house bill and not insist
upon the Clarke amendment approved
by the senate which would give inde
pendence by 1920. T. R. Yangco,
president of the Philippine chamber of
commerce, saw the president with Mr.
Quezon. The whole question was dis
cussed at length and the president
promised to consult with senate and
house leaders.

From Cab and Nearly
Loses Her Life
MALE COMPANION IS
SLIGHTLY INJURED
Earl Everett Is Bruised
Slightly and Driver
Receives Cuts
Miss Rilla Stain, 606 Bast McLean
street, former deputy clerk of the Uni
ted States court,, and Earl Everett of
Mt. Pleasant, narrowly escaped death
Sunday night at 9:30 o'clock when a
taxi cab in which they were riding
collided with an east bound street car,
at Court and Main streets. Miss Stain
was thrown from the taxi in front of
the car which came to a stop, and
struck the fender. Frank Higdon,
driver of the car was slightly cut by
glass. The front of the street car
was smashed and the front of the taxi
was practically demolished.
Miss Stain and Mr. Everett started
for home in a taxi from Second and
M&rket street when it began raining.
The driver went west on' Second
street to Court and south on Court to
Main street where the accident oc
curred. The motorman on the street
car noticed the taxi as It turned and
threw on the brakes stopping the car,
thus preventing a more serious acci
dent.
Miss Stain was thrown from the
taxi by the force of the collision and
fell directly in front of the car. When
Mr. Everett picked her up her head
was lying under the fender of the
street car. The lobe of Miss Stain's
left ear was nearly severed and eleven
stitches were taken. Her right arm
at the elbow and wrist is badly bruised
and swollen and she has a cut below
the left knee. Mr. Everett and Mr.
Higdon were slightly cut.
The left front jfheel of the taxi
was broken into pieces and the frame
work and top of the taxi in the front
was crushed. Part of the front vesti
bule of the car was broken and it was
necessary to put a new car on the
line.
Higdon, the driver, had a narrow
escape as the entire front part of the
car was telescoped around him and the
wind shield was shattered.
KAISER SUGGESTS
PEACE POSSIBILITY
IS REPORTED TO HAVE ADDRESS
ED THE POPE IN HOPES OF
ENDING THE WAR.
London, May 8. —The correspondent
at Rotterdam of the Exchange Tele

"On the occasion of the Easter festi
val, Emperor William sent an auto
graph letter to Pope Benedict, express
ing the hope that the pontiff, with
the king of Spain, would be able to
construct a scheme with the object of
bringing together, under the auspi
cious emblem of the dove and olive
branch, a conference of belligerents
for consideration of an immediate arm
istice, in the fervent hope of securing
an early peace without detriment to
the legitimate aspirations of national
ities."
The correspondent says he obtains
this information from a circular just
issued by the German humanity league.
The circular also says considerable
significance is attached to the arrival
in Rome of envoys from the kings of
Bavaria and Saxony, who bad prolong
ed audiences with Cardinal Gasparri,
papal secretary of state.

CROPS NOT UP TO
USUAL MARK SAYS
FEDERAL REPORT
WINTER WHEAT IN POOR CONDI
TION AND YIELD IS FAR
FROM RECORD.
Washington, D. C., May 8.—'The win
ter wheat crop this year promises to
yield 499,280,000 bUBhels, the depart
ment of agriculture announced today,
basing its forecast on the condition of
the crop May 1. The output will prob
ably be above or below those figures,
according to the change In conditions
from now until time of harvest. To
day's forecast oompares with 666,
046,000 bushels harvested last year,
the greatest winter wheat crop ever
gathered In this country, and with a
forecast of 640,000,000 bushels made
last December before the crop entered
the winter from which it emerged in
rather poor condition, showing a de
cline of 9.4 points compared with the
ten year average decline of 3.6 points.
On the crop's condition April 1 a fore
cast of 496,000,000 bushels was made
by the bureau of crop estimates, as
suming average abandonment of
acreage qnd average influences on the
crop to harvest time.
The area of winter wheat to be har
vested is estimated at about 33,020,
000 acres as a result of the May 1 can
vass. The area planted last fall was
37,266,000 acres, a decrease of 4,756,
000 acres from the record area of the
1916 crop and compares with a yearly
average of 32,088,000 acres in the pre
ceding five years.
The condition of winter wheat on
May 1 was 82.4 per cent of a normal,
compared with 78.3 on April 1 last,
92.9 on May 1 last year and 87.5, the
ten year May 1 average. That condi
tion is indicative of a yield of 15.1
bushels an acre, compared with 16.2
bushels harvested last year and 19.0
bushels In 1914.
The large reduction in acreage sown
last fall was attributed partly to un
favorable weather for seeding, tangled
condition of much corn land which
otherwise would have been sown to
wheat, some fear of the Hessian fly
and to large supplies of wheat on
hand.
A wet cold fall, causing poor seed
beds and poor start for wintering re
sulted in a low condition this spring.
Much of ty® crop was sown,late and
the Hessian fly was reported present
and active in many sections of the
southern part of the winter wheat belt.
Climatic conditions were harder on
late sown, the winter covering was
lighter than usual and the Injury from
freezing and thawing greater than in
previous years.
Other details of the May report
show:
Rye—Condition 88.7 per cent of nor
mal compared with 87.8 on April 1
last, 98.3 on May 1 last year and 90.6
the ten year May 1 average.
Meadow (hay lands)—Condition
88.4 per cent of a normal, compared
with 89.8 on May 1 last year and 88.3
the ten year May 1 average.
Hay—Stocks of hay on farms May
1 are estimated at 11,049,000 tons, or
13.0 per cent of last year's crop,
against 8,468,000 tons, or 12.1 per cent
on May 1 last year, and 8,109,000 tons
or 12.1 per cent the five year May 1
average.
Pastures—Condition 86.2 per cent of
a normal, against 87.2 on May 1 last
year and 86.9 the ten year May 1 aver
age.
Spring plowing was 70.4 per cent
completed up to May 1, compared with
78.3 on May 1 last year and 68.6 the
ten year May 1 average.
Spring planting was 66.7 per cent
completed up to May 1 compared with
66.3 on May 1 last year and 55.9 the
ten year May 1 average.
SPECIAL SERVICE
FORTHECHILDREN
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 8. —A
service for the burial of children and
their reception into the church is pro
posed in a revised ritual of the Metho
dist Episcopal church, which was sub
mitted today for action by the general
conference in session here. Previously
only a ceremony for adults has existed.
The report was offered by a special
committee appointed in 1912 and is the
third proposal recently made for a
change in the form of services provid
ed by John Wesley when he instituted
the church in 1739. The argument was
advanced during discussion today that
a modification of the wording is neces
sary to consistency of usage and great
er clearness and brevity. Opposition
was based on the ground that the lan
guage of the present ritual had been
made sacred by continued use.
The suggested form provides that
service for baptism of infants and for
ordination shall be greatly shortened.
The burial service would be modified
by the insertion of additional scrip
tural Beleotlons giving fuller expres
sion of the Christian hope as found in
the new testament. In the marriage
ceremony it Is provided that when the
ring is used the words "and with all
my worldly goods I thee endow," shall
be omitted, ror the reason the commit
