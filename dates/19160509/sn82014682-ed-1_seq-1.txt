Two More Provinces - Declare
$ Independence and Yuan
- Loses Strongholds;
(Special Cable to Nlppu JUL)
TOKIO. Japan, May 9. Revolution
ists now bave. control over central
China. Yesterday Sze Chuen and
Hupeh provinces officially announced
their independence of Yuan Shih-KaL
The former province is the largest in
China, the latter is the most import
ant from a military and commercial
standpoint
The independence of these two pro
vinces gives the revolutionists com
plete control of the upper Yiangtse
Kiang river for hundreds of ; miles,
and Hankow, the strongest military
post on the Yiangtse is in control of
the revolutionary party.
Chingtu and Pau Ning, the two cit-
ies in Sze Chuen controlled by Yuan
Shih-KaL were captured on Saturday,
and as a result the entire province is
now in the bands of tbe revolution
ists. With Yunnan and Kweichau on
the south, Independent Yuan has lost
his last bold on western and central
China. .; ' i .
Hankow, in Hupeh, is one of the
largest cities of Caina, and with the
cities of Wu Chang and . Hangyang
across the river, the population united
Is more than one million. . Hankow
is a treaty port, and controls the en
tire upper Yiangtse river.
Wu Chang was the first city to de
clare independence of the Manchu
dynasty in the first revolution. Lu
Yuan Hung at that time in command
of the garrison in that city announced
his Independence, and China was
made a republic. He was later elect
ed as vice-president of the republic
when Yuan Shlh-Kat was named as
chief executive, v
news of this sort would bring rejoic
ing to many guardsmen here.
News that, the President bad called
out the militia of three states caused
various bits ot speculation at army
and guard headquarters today. It is
the general belief that the troops un
der this call will not cross the line
and go into tie interior of Mexico,
but will rather be used fbr border
duty, being stationed along the line
In small towns and relieving the reg
ulars who have been there and who
will be needed on the first line. .
At the last off leal gucrd census
Arizona had 80$ men in the guard, ot
whom 492 were present at federal in
spection. Texas had 2956, of whom
729 were present and New Mexico
had present 53 out of a total of 1729.
t is pointed out that Hawaii had ap
proximately 4500 present for inspec
tion out of a total of 5000.

The boom for Gen. Leonard Wood as

Several other booms and boomlets
have come here in (he past few
month. Friends of Senator Burton,
Congressman Mann, Elihu Root
Charles Warren Fairbanks and others
have written here to get a line on the

erature has arrived.
Hawaii doesn't get a chance to vote
In tbe national elections and so far
Hawaii isn't sure of a chance to vote
in the Republican cpnventlon which
will nominate the G. O. P. candidate.
If the Hawaii delegation of two is
seated with the right to vote, the ter

MADE EFFECTIVE
Raise Means Payroll of Steam
ers Witt Be Close to $40,000
More Every Year
News that the Matson Navigation
Company has voluntarily' raised the
salaries of all employes on its steam
ers, the increases ranging from $5 to
$10 a month, and meaning an expen
diture close to $40,000 a year above
tbe old payroll reached here this
morning on, the Matson liner Wilhei
mlna. ' ' ..
When asked for a statement on the
line's action, Capt Peter Johnson, the
Wllhelmlna's commander, said that It
is true, and that the increase became"
effective the day following the arrival
of the Wilhelmina in San Francisco
April 25, from Honolulu. - She left
here on her last voyage April 19.
' The Increase amounts to $38,000 a
year, for all the ships, - said Capt
Johnson. "For my ship it will mean
$50 more a month, as there are 100
men in the crew, and the average in
crease of pay to each Is $7.50.
"Oilers and firemen are now re
ceiving $10 a month more than before;
sailors, $5 a month more, and; stew-
a a - . m m. .
aras ana men empioyea in me stew
ard's department, $5 a month."
Officers of the liner said Capt Mat
son had authorized the increase with
out any conference with the represen
tatives of the unions concerned. At
a recent conference held in San Fran
cisco other" coastwise steamship l'i
agreed to meet the demands for high
er wages asked by the sailors, wai tors,
oilers and wipers' onions.
Prior to the raise Capt Matson, the
Wllhelmlna's officers say, was psinp
more than the union scale to a num
ber of employes. The present raise
adds a corresponding amount to their
salaries, over what they would receive
under the union rates.
The unions in San Francisco de
manded the raise on and after May 1
Capt Matson made it effective April
26, the day after the Wilhelmina
reached the coast on her last voy
age from this port.

NEW YORK, May 1. Lieut. Robert
Fay of the German army, on trial
here with two others charged with
conspiring to blow up vessels laden'
with munitions for the Entente Al
lies, today was extended the privilege
by Judge Howe of cross-examining an
unfriendly witness. ; He asserted that
his attorney was . not . properly con
ducting a detail or the case.
: Edward Brecker a reporter em
ployed by the New York World,
was on the- witness stand when Fay
sprang to his feet and asked to con
duct the cross-examination. T
"My counsel,", het said, "cannot de
fend me because he is not conversant
with many details of the case."
Fay's lawyer, former Assistant
District Attorney V'Unger, appeared
stunned and the court adjourned to
permit a consultation between Unger
and the prisoner.-
Unger explained; later that Fay
bad neglected to tell him many
things, and for , that reason, be said.
It might be best to grant Fay s re-
cueat. ; -i
." Although I havj never "heard of
such a proceeding," said Judge Howe,
"in view of the fact that Fay is a
foreigner and . that his counsel con
sents, I shall permit the prisoner to
examine the witness within certain
bounds.
Fay then . obtained affirmative
answers from the witness to a series
of questions directed to show that he
discussed war munitions with
Brecker.
Judge Howe.i however,- interrupted
Fay . and refused td permit further
questioning when the prisoner said

spite of. the enemy's tenacious, dense
and furious counter-attacks the Ger
mans took the whole system of trench

The German lines reach to the top
of the height ' The 'enemy suffered
extraordinarily bloody losses, so that
on?y 40 officers, unwounded, and 1280
soldiers were taken by us. The ene
my's counter actions against our po
sitions on the .western slope were ev
erywhere repulsed with heavy losses.
East of Meuse bitter fighting waged
on both sides of Ferme and Thlau
mont The enemy east of Ferme,
among other troops, employed ne
groes. The attack broke down and
300 were prisonered. In combats
mentioned, fresh French troops were
recognized. ' ." V
The enemy in the Meuse' sector, in
eluding divisions which wer .osada
second time after complete filling up,
employed 51 divisions, which means
fully as mhch as double the forces en
gaged by the Germans who are at
tacking. '
