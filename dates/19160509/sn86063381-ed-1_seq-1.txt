Record at East Grand Forks.
East Grand Forks, Minn., May 9
Glenn A. Thompson of Bemidji, by
obtaining the highest class standing
of the boys enrolled in the local high
school has won a scholarship
in either Hamhne, Carleton or
Macalester college, according to an
announcement made today by Super
intendent F. E Lurton
In the local final examinations,
Thompson received exceptionally
high marks and is now certain of
graduation. In class standings he
ranks fifth, four girls having re
ceived higher averages.
The record established by Thomp
son is unprecedented in local school
annals. Entering the East Grand
Forks high school late in the term,
he was forced to make up the work
which he had missed during the first
semester. He has worked his way
through the final year of his high
school career by employment in the
Hotel Dacotah at Grand Forks. He
recently accepted a position in the
editorial department of the Grand
Forks Herald and plans on spending
the summer months in that city.
Mr. Thompson has not decided
whether or not he will take advan
tage of the scholarships, as he had
previously planned on entering the
North Dakota university next fall.

custom and are allowing some of the

It is expected that the music fur

consist of the good old English bal

their popularity in Shakespeare's

SHORE TO SECOND
City Council Decides in Favor

Engineer.
of
M. & I. WITHDRAWS
OFFERS AND OBJECTS
Present Bridge and Railroad Cross
ing Not Safe to Condemn at
Once.
The Bemidji city council at an ad
journed meeting last evening at the
city hall decided to construct the Ny
more highway along the lake shore
to Second street and then to Beimdji
avenue. Plans of the city engineer
were accepted and the city attorney
was instructed to draw up a resolu
tion to provide for the condemning of
property for the route.
Railway Objects.
The Minnesota & International
railway company which objects to
the opening of Second street, has an
nounced that it will take the matter
into court, protesting against the
new route.
Railroad officials and several cit
izens attended the meeting of the
council last evening and participated
in the discussions.
Cost About Same.
City Engineer Swinson submitted
estimates showing that the fill in the
lake shore route would cost about
$2,574 and the paving $5,050, mak
ing the total expense of the lake shore
highway without the construction of
a bridge $7,634.
The engineer estimated that to
make a fill at the present route as
proposed by the Minnesota & Inter
national railway would cost $1,360
and the pavement would cost $2,542,
making the total cost $4,002.
The difference in the expense of the
two projects would be about $3,600.
However, one-half of the pavement on
the lake shore highway is assessable
to the railroad company and it would
cost about $1,000 to move the high
tension steel fowers at the present
crossing The two projects, there
fore, would cost practically the same.
Favorhird Street.
There was much discussion at the
meeting last evening. The railway
company favored a route along the
lake shore to Third street but re
fused to consider the opening cf Sec
ond street. They withdrew their
Third street offer after action taken
by the city council last evening.
Insult to City.
"The present crossing is blocked
every day. It is an insult and dis
grace to the city," said Alderman
Bailey. There is no place in the
state that has as dangerous a cross
ing Any railroad official or citizen
who would watch the traffic at the
present crossing for 20 minutes
would turn away in shame."
"The citizens do not want to do
anything against the railway com
pany but the citizens do not want to
be imposed upon," said President Ly
can after discussing proposed chan
ges to the present route.
A. M. Bagley, president of the Be
midji Auto club, stated that in his
belief the present route is not safe.
"We ought to change the lake shore
route or make the other one wider,"
said Mr. Bagley. "I favor the lake
shore proposition."
Favors Present Route.
T. J. Burke of the Northern Gro
cery company advocated the chang
ing of the present route, stating that
he believed that the lake shore pro
position would be too expensive.
"The majority of the citizens do
not want the present crossing," said
Alderman Smart.
The city light committee reported
favorably on the placing of street
lights on Dalton avenue on 21st, 22nd
and 23rd streets.
The light committee was asked to
investigate the request of George
French for lights on 15th street and
Irvine avenue.
The city engineer was instructed
to repair the cement paving and $100
was appropriated for that purpose.

President Wilson Sends Answer $oJ
German Reply Note Cabled by
Lansing.
CONSIDERED THAT
TEUTONS YIELDED
America Relies on Germans for the
Scrupulous Execution of
Altered Policies.
Washington, May 9 President
Wilson has replied to Germany's re
ply and has squarely placed Germany^
on trial.
A note cabled by Secretary Lansing
informs the German government that
the United States accepts its "declara
tion of abandonment" of a former
submarine policy and now relies up
on a scrupulous execution of altered
policies to remove the principle dan
ger of an interruption' of the good
relations existing between the two
countries.
Text of Note.
The following is the text of the
note cabled to Ambassador Gerard,
with instructions to deliver it to the
German minister of foreign affairs:
"The note of the imperial German
government, under date of May 4,
1916, has received careful considera
tion by the government of the United
States. It is especially noted as in
dicating the purpose of the imperial
government as to the feature that is
is prepared to do its utmost to con
fine the operations of war, for the
rest of its duration to the fighting
forces of the belligerents and that it
is determined to impose upon all its
commanders at sea the limitation of
the recognized rule of international
law upon which the government of
the United States has insisted.
Guided by Friendship.
"Throughout the months that have
elapsed since the imperial govern
ment announced on-February 4, 1&15,
its submarine policy, now happily
abandoned, the government of the
United States has been constantly"
guided and restrained by motives, of
friendship in a patient effort to
briug to an amicable settlement the
critical question arising from that
policy AetJept*ng the imperial gor^
ernment's declaration of its abandon
ment of the policy which has so
seriously menaced the good relations
between the two countries, the gov
ernment of the United States will
rely upon a scrupulous execution
henceforth of the now altered policy
of the imperial government, such as
will remove the principal danger to
an interruption of the good relations
existing between the United States,
and Germany.
Not for Discussion.
"The government of the United
States feels if necessary to state that
it takes it for granted that the im
perial German government does not
intend to imply that the maintenance
of its newly announced policy is in
any way contingent upon the courae
or result of diplomatic negotiations
between the governments of the Unit
ed States and any belligerent govern
ment, notwithstanding the fact that
certain passages in the imperial gov
ernment note of the 4th inst. might*
apear to be susceptible of the con
struction. In order, however, to
avoid any possible misunderstanding
the government of the United States
notifies the imperial government that
it cannot for a moment entertain,
much less discuss, a suggestion that
respect by German naval authorities
for the right of citizens of the United
States upon the high seas should in
any way or in the slightest degree be
made contingent upon the conduct cf
any other government affecting the
right of neutrals and noncombatants.
Responsibility in such matters is
single, not joint absolute, not rela-
tive."
