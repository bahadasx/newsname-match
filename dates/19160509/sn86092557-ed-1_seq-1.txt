BEAR ATE STRYCHINE.
MARL1NTON, W. Va.. May 9.?A
powerful bear was trapped at Stonv
Bottom, this county, Saturday. It
weighed nearly 400 pounds and had a
fine hide. The bruin was a sheep
kiler aad when caught in the trap it
carried the trap nearly a mile, and
was only stopped when the trap be
came entangled in a wire fence.
It is believed that the bear was Ira
mune to the effects of strychnine, be
cause it ate so much bait poisoned
with that chemical. The natives say
that during the past winter'they set
quantities of bait poisoned with
strychnine and the bait was always
eaten, but never killed the animal
which devoured it. Foot marks show
ed It was always a bear which con
sumed the bait.

Race Case May Be Resumed
Before End of the
Week.
Judge W. S. Haymond of the circuit
court returned to the bench today and
devote/1 his attention to a number of
matters that were awaiting him. The
Judge was out yesterday but kept the
court open for but a short session. As
the end of the present term of the
circuit-court is near at hand ?t-is un
likely that much new business will
be transacted. Every effort will be
made to finish all the work that has
been begun at this Bession by Saturday
and the. court will probably adjourn
at that time. The beginning of the
June term is but three weeks away
and the Judge wishes to bo fully re
covered so that the postponed crimi
nal docket'can be dispatched at that
time.1 The Race case, which .is still
unfinished may bo completed at this
term if the presence of Mr. Race can
be secured. The motion to set aside
the veidlct in this case is yet to be
argued and if this is overruled by the
court sentence will be passed, conclud
ing the case. 10 was thought today,
that Race would'be'present tomorrow,
or the next day.'
