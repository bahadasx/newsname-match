Bismarck pioneers have come to
bat for the best interests of their
city with a vim during the past week.
Among the genuine "old-timers" who

for the movement, are Philip Harvey,
Martin Bourgois and William E.

heavily interested in Bismarck Pat­

John Yegen, Patrick Kelley, E. L.

Dakota Territory, "With the Wards,
Williams and Wakemans, and the
Dunns, and the Jewells and the
Webbs," and a host of other names
which for more than a generation
have been identified with Bismarck.
Ail Anxious to Sign.
"You bet I am in favor of paving,"
said one "old-timer" yesterday. "I've
seen this city grow from nothing to
what it is today. 1 want to see it a
r^al city before I pass on. And I
want to set some pleasure out of
thet=e improvements before I go."
The petitions will come before the
City commission for definite consider­
ation next Monday evening. In (he
meantime a few finishing touches will
be a pp.ted, merely for good measure.

SCRUPULOUS EXECUTION
OF POLICY DEMANDED
Says Neutral Rights Are Not
Contingent Upon Conduct of
Other Nations.
Washington, May 8.—A note cabled
(by Secretary Lansinu to Ambassador
Gerard today for delivery to the Ber­
lin Foreign Office informs the Ger­
man government that the United
States "accepts its declaration of
abandonment of its former submarine
policy, and now relies upon scrupul­
ous execution of the altered policy
to remove the principal danger of
an interruption of the good relations
existing between the two countries."
With !this acceptance, is coupled
formal notice to Germany that the
United States cannot for a moment
entertain, much less discuss, a sug­
gestion that' respect by German naval
authorities of the rights of citizens
of the United States on the high seas
should in the slightest degree be made
contingent: upon the conduct of any
other Kovernment. affecting the rights
of neutrals and non-combatants.
Reply to Statements.
This is in reply to the concluding
statement in the last German note to
the effect that while submarine com­
manders had been ordered to sink no
peaceful freight or passenger carry­
ing ship, without warning or with­
out safety for passengers and crew,
the (ierman government would re­
serve lo itself complete liberty of de­
cision unless the United States was
successful in its efforts to break the
British blockade.
Secretary Lansing issued a tdale
ment tonight:, saving that the greater
part of the German answer, to the
U.
S. note wore devoted to matter they
ed lo our suggestions.".
Note To Germany.
Following' is text of note cabled by
Secretary Lansing lo Ambassador
Berard at Berlin, with instructions
to deliver it to the German minister
of foreign affairs:
"The note of the Imperial German
government in:oer date of May 4,

ation by the government of the Unit­

to an amicable settlement the critical
questions arising from that policy.
Accepting the Imperial Government's
declaration of its abandonment of the
policy, which has so seriously men­
aced the good relations between the
two countries, the government of the
United States will rely upon a scru­

now altered policy of the Imperial

Carl A. Londerwitz Charged
With Procuring' False Pass­
port for Confessed Spy.
New York, May 8.—Carl A. Loud
eritz, German consul, at Baltimore,
Maryland, was indicted by the Fed­
eral Grand Jury here today, charged
with procuring a false passport for
Horst Van Der Golz, confessed spy.
Another indictment was handed down,
charging Wolffe Von Igle, former sec­
retary of Capt. .Franz Von Papen, re­
called military attache. Dr. Walter
J. Schlee, already indicted in the al­
leged "fire bomb plot" and Gustave
Steinberg alleged aide of Franz Von
Rintelen, German agent, with con­
spiring to falsify a ship's manifest'
in sending a cargo of lubricating oil
to Germany.
The indictment against conusl
Louderitz charges that he obtained
a possport for Von Der Golz in the
name of Bridgman, W. Taylor, from
I he Secretary of 9tate at Washington,
August 24, 1914, and that on October
2, of the same year, the passport was
vised by the Italian consul general
here. On the following day, Von Der
Golz sailed for Genoa, Italy, on board
the Italian liner Diuca d' Aosta.
According to Federal officials the
new indictment against Wolfife Von
Igle and Schlee was made possible
by the papers seized from the office
of Von Igle. They alleged that papers
found among Von Igle's effect show
that the freight charges on the oil
"were paid by Von Igle, while employ­
ed by Capt. Von Papen.

said later there had been no develop­
ments in the situation.
Officials would not comment on
border advices, saying Gen. Fnnston
had repeatedly urged that his forces
be /strengthened. The question |of
calling out a portion of the 'National
Guard is not under immediate con­
sideration, however, and as the only
other means of aiding materially the
border patrol would be to employ
coast artillery troops as Infantry for
that purpose, there is nothing to Indl-.
cate that Gen. Funston's force is to
be increased.
Senator Borah issued a statement
tonight urging that additional troops
be sent to the border and any man
or posse in Mexico that sought to
emibarrasg the task of protecting the
American border be treated as ene­

It was stated today ottclally that

be in force.

what steps were being taken to In­

tion for the Columbus or tke Glenn

American side of the border.
Secretary ansing forwarded rep­
