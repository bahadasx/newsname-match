fop the latest raid into American
territory are "enemies of Mexico as
well as the Fnited States." He be
lieves that the attack on border
towns carried out last Friday night
should not justify the sending of any
more Fnited States troops into this
country.
Gen. Carranza has wired Gen. Al

the American chief-of-staff. along
the lines originally laid down.
"Such incidents as the Fig Fend

LONDON, May :h The White
s-tar express freighter Cymric, which
was torpedoed by a German submar
ine off the Irish coast on Monda.
afternoon, sank this morning.
Hefore r.e.vs of the sinking of the
i .V) )-ton freighter was rect ived. it
had been reported that the disabled
vessel was on her way to an Irish
port.
-V Floyd's dispatch, received just
before noon, stated that all on board
the Cymric had been saved.
The NVhite Star freighter, which
was under orders lrom t lie Iiritish
admiralty, and carrietl a caro of
war supplier estimated to be worth
nearly a million dollars, was sup
posed to bo under convoy ot a war
ship because of the importance ;;nd
value of her caruo.
It was regarded as possible that
the attack might have been mad- in
the presence of an Fnudish man-of-w
a r.
The lielief here at the tune news
ot the sinking of the ship was ro-
ceived was that there were no Amer
ican citizens on board.
Carried Crew of 110.
The ship carried a eievv of 110
men and, in addition, live Kn-lidi
seamen froT another ship, who were
returning from New York because of
sickness.
The Cymric, which sailed from
New York on Apiil -'J, wi.s com
manded hy Capt. F. K. Feadnell and
carried, among other articles, the
following:
Fight cases of firearms, la cases
of guns, 0 ;-;ses of rifles, SJO er. ses
of gun covers. 4 h o reels of barbed
wire, 11,010 cases of empty shell-?,
six cases of bavonets. :!".l bales of

cases of primers, 'J.D .". cases of forg

107 cafes of copper tubes, l o cases
of f iiseheais. 8.6 00 cases of cart
ridges, lubricating oils and agricul
tural machinery.
Word was nnxiouslv awaited as
to the fate of members i f the crew.
Karly dispatches relating to the
Cymric were m oarer and did not
say whether the explosion had killed
and wounded any of the mermen on
board.
Tll freizhter evidently remained,
afloat about 10 or 12 hours after the
explosion had occurred, which would
have given time for es -a e from tue

It was recalled that tn-1 FtPi-h
