IMG OF THE BOARD
The regular monthly business
mooting of the Hoard of Supervisors
of the Countv of Kauai was hold at
the office of the Board on Wednes
day, May Ilrd., 1!1', at 10 o'eloek.
1'resent: II. D. Wishard, chair
man; T. Brandt, W. I). MoBryde,
Joe Rndriguese, A. Monofoglio.
The minutes of the last meeting
were read and approved.
A request (P II! 12) from Col.
Broadbent on behalf of the '1th In
fantry N. (!. II. for financial assis
tance to defray the expenses of car
rying on 1 1 io work in connection
with the drilling, etc., of the 12
companies, and the hospital corps, i
composing the -1th Regiment, X. G.
II., was received, also the legal
opinion of the County Attorney in
regard to the request. Both docu
ments were read. Upon motion of

foglio, the request, by unanimous
vole, was denied.

The-committees of the National
Guard on Fourth of July celebra
tion had a bong session with the
chairman of the Board of Super
visors i n the County Building
Saturday night in the effort to
straighten out the matter of where
the finances tor the affair are to
come from. Reports from the
transportation coinnittee develop
ed the gratitving fact that the
nine companies of outside troops
tiny be moved into Lihueand back
home again without charge. That
cut the prospective expenses in
half at one shot and greatly
simplified the problem.
The supervisors, according to
Mr. Wishard, were doubtful that
they could appropriate money for
the entire budget of expense?., but
it appeared that a total of $500 of
the items submitted bv the com
mittee were within the law; and
he thought that the supervisors
could be relied upon to supply
that amount, the officers of the
Guard to raise t lie remaining sum
of S5oo.
The chairman of the finance
committee replied to Ibis that if
the supervisors would appropriate
S500 as suggested the officers of
the regiment would put up the
remaining $500. That seemed
satisfactory all around and was
adopted bv vote as the plan to be
worked upon.
The finance committee announc
ed that it would issue cards with
out delay to all officers of the reg
iment inviting their contribu
tions.
Captain Carden, for. the sports
committee, made a very satisfac
tory report of plans for the big
Fourth of July program.
It was stated at the meeting that
General Samuel I. Johnson and
perhaps other military notables
would be present for the events.
Fun At Makaweli
"Midnight Follies Of The Ma
kaweli Girls" is one explantory
note, on a card iust out. The affair

SIGNAL SUCCESS
The second battalion, Fourth
Infantry, N' G. H., most royally
entertained a very large number
of people from all parts of Kauai
it the famous Lawai beach house
Sundav. Not only was it a dav of
pleasure long to be remembered,
but the coffers of Major McBrydcV
battalion were left simply bulging
out with the dav's receipts.
Automobiles began to arrive at
the top of the hill about 10 o'clock
and before long the roadwavs there
were filled with them. Then came
the excursion trains from the Ma
kaweli Eleele side, which pretty
well filled the large grounds with
military men and their friends
The beach house proper was re
served for dancing a pastime
which was kept going pretty yvell
all day. Here and there in the
pretty grove were booths of varied
design and equally varied contents
There were flowtr, refreshment
and candy booth; all sorts of guess
ing and chance propositions; "hit
theniger" affair; wheels of fortune,
and heavens knows what all all
doing a land-office business and
the big crowd gleeful in the ex
treme all the while.
At noon th re was a regular, old
time Hawaiian luau-the real thing,
where you sit down on your feet
(or lomebodv else's feet)and gorge
your way to stomachic satisfaction .
There was not an idle moment,
nor a dull moment, nor an un
pleasant moment nor a moment
when one whished to be elsewhere;
and when the affair gradually
dwindled to a close the unanimous
opinion was that it was the hugest
and most signal success of any
military function yet attempted.
Nawiliwili Deferred
Tim:(!ai:ii:n Isi.anh received from
its Washington correspondent! lelin-
ite information this ntorning that
the NTiwihwili harbor appropriation
had been side-tracked, practically
without recall at this session. The
following is the information, which
is dated April 27.
The Senate Committee on Com
merce, which has charge of the riv
ers and harbors bill, has formally
decided not to add new projects to
the bill which has passed the House.
The House bill provided only for
projects under way, with the excep
tion of one item for the improve
ment of New York harbor, which
was inserted in the bill at the pcr
sonoj request and direction of the
President. The action T the Senate
Committee makes it reasonably cer
tain that no provision will be made
in the pending bill for the Nawili
wili and Honolulu harbor projects.
