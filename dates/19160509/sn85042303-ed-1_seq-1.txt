Washington, D. C, May 9.
President Wilson today called
out the militia of Texas, Arizo
na and New Mexico to deal
with the border situation.
Secretary Baker in a state
ment said that the Big Bend
outbreak has so far further em
phasized the danger of similar
1 occurrences along the border
that the president called out
the militia of the three border
state, instructing them to report
to General Funston, who will
assign them to border stations.
Two additional regiments of
the regular infantry have been
directed to proceed to the bor
der from other departments.
More Troops Asked For
Washington, P. C, May 9.
Scott and Funston advised the
war department that more
troops are urgently needed
along the border as a return of
the Big Bend raiders might be
expected. The number of j
troops patrolling the border is
insufficient, Baker said, and
the new-movements are merely
for the protection of the border.
The state militia is ordered
out under the Dick law, author
izing their service anywhere in
the United States, but they can
not be used beyond the Amer
ican border.

Funston to San Antonio
El Paso, Tex., May 9. Upon re
ceipt of the news that the state militia
had bene called out, General Funston
announced that lie would return to
headquarters at San Antonio as soon
as he can make arrangements. His
departure is contingent upon Scott re
lieving him of further participation
in the Obregon conferences.
Texans Ready in Short Time.
(Austin, Texas, May 9. The first
advices received by Adjutant Gen
eral Hutchings concerning the calling
out of the Texas militia came through
the Associated Press. Later when
the official order was received, Hut
chings stated that the call required
liim to be subject to Funston's orders.
About thirty-five hundred men are en
rolled at present and he said he could
move every member in forty-eight
hours.
New Mexico Militia.
Santa Fe, N. M., May 9. New Mex
ico's militia, approximating eleven
hundred men, can be on the way to

cording to Adjutant General Herring.
Arizona Men Read Wednesday.
Phoenix, Ariz., Mav 9. The Ari
zona national guaM of five hundred
men will be ready fo border sen ice

The special train bearing the Okla
homa City boosters will arrive in this
city tomorrow afternoon at 6:33, and
will remain all night. The chamber of
commerce is planning to give them
a reception when they arrive and a
special program) will be given for
their benefit at the Elks club. The vis
itors will form in line at the station
and march up Main street, headed by
their band, after which they will dis
perse and mingle witli the merchants
and business men until time for the re
ception at the Elks club. The Cham
ber of Commerce and the Business
Mens' association has pinned to furnish
them with a luncheon, but at the re
quest of the members of the party this
part of the program was dispensed
with.
CAPON INDUSTRY A
PROFITABLE BUSINESS
A burglary and a hold up was the
record lor last night in the city and
in both instances there is little chance
to capture the perpetrators. Last night
about nine o'clock as Tom Wilson
was on his way to town he was held
up by a couple of men near the Waters
Pierce oil tanks on the Santa Fe
tracks relieved of his watcli and $115
in cash. One of the men pushed a big
gun under his nose, commanded him to
elevate his hands while his pal went I
through his pockets, lie was then told
to march down the track and not look
back which he did while the robbers
vanished.
An entrance was gained to the store
of Jesse Akers on Caddo street last
night, but owing to the nature of the
stock it was impossible to ascertain
just what was missing. This same
store was entered a short time ago
and several suits of clothes taken. En
trance was gained by prying loose
bars from over a rear window and
breaking the catcli with a "jimmy."
The officers are doing their 'best to
thoroughly police the town, but with
the limited number of men allowed
it is impossible to give the citizens
the protection that it seems is re
quired.
Since the lid went on in Hagtown,.
the idle gentry that infest all new min
ing camps or oil towns, havo been
wending their way toward this city
and a crusade will probably be start
ed to keep them going, unless they can
produce pretty good evidence that they
have a legitimate means of support.
No Americans Were Aboard White
Star Liner Which Left New York
for Liverpool April Twenty-Ninth
With Big Cargo of Munitions.
Stillwater, Okla., May 0. George
Wyatt, a banker of Manitou, Oklaho
ma, is a strong believer in the capon j
industry, according to County Agent
W. A. Conner of Tillman County, Ok
lahoma. "Last year about 200 capons were
raised in this community," writes the
county agent. "The local buyer told
me he could have paid 25c per pound
in car load lots. We will try to get
a car this year. Three members of
the Poultry Association have already
promised to try 100 'birds each, and
others will try smaller numbers."
:M.r. Wyatt has been agitating the
matter of caponizing surplus roosters
for two or three years, says the county
agent, and the idea seems to be taking
hold. When it is remembered that ca
pons weigh considerably more than
roosters, it is easy to see that there Is
good profit in them at 25c a pound.

IKE ESCAPE

MAYSVILLE BOY PROVES
PURE BRED STOCK PAY3
There was scarcely a ripple of excitement in the streets of Berlin when extra editions of the newspapers car
ried the text of Wilhelm's reply to American demands in the name of humanity. And the press the editors were silent
What they did say seemed uninspired. The masses of Germany seemed not to Care. It was diplomacy so allow diplo
macy to worry with it. But what of the Kaiser the silent leader who grows dark of countenance and gray at the temples
as the war is forged along ? Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown ! How like your own business house ! Do your
employe and your friends worry about things that make you gray? Do you suppose every employe of the Ardmoreite realizes
that it costs twice as much to furnish print paper for the presses as it did ninety days ago ? They would worry, of course,
but do they ? And so, like Germany's masses, are you of Ardmore gay while the man who pays you money writhes as the
shafts his business problems hurl into his most strongly fortified trenches? The head that wears the crown lies uneasy but
you, each of you, could resolve today to bear a part of the bosses' burdens and profit by it.
