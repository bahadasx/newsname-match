ambassador, said he had told the sec
retary Vthere is not an iota of truth"
in reports from the border 'that Gen
eral Obregon had demanded the with
drawal of American troops..
The ambassador denied also that
Mexican-' troops had ; been disposed
during the El Paso conference so as
to threaten General. Pershing's line of
communication. , -
Mr. Arredondo asked that increased
vigilance be exercised 'by the Ameri
can border authorities' against -activi
ties of the enemies or. DOtn countries
who, he 'said, were seeking to force
them into war by the border raids.
'The de facto government," Mr.

21st infantry at Vancouver Barracks,
and' two battalions, of the 14th infan
try, one located at Fort Law ton, near
Seattle, .Wash., and one -at Spokane,
Wash. ' "
The total additional force on the
border including" both regulars and
militia, is approximately S.00O men.
Secrefary Baker has, not been ad
vised 'whether a new expedition has
yrossed the border in pursuit of tha
raiders but orders . hoye not been
changed and General Funston is free
to follow 'any hot "trail across the line.
It was made plain hire that the -expedition
will remain in Mexico until
the Carranza. government has proven
its ability- to check brigandage and. ;
guarantee . the eecurit? of America n '
border towns. ' Secretary Baker- said
there hadi'been no change in policy.
Secretary Baker said tihe orders"
sending more troops to the border :
were made on the urgent recommen
dation' of boh General Scott and
General Funston and were, without
significance in" connection with the
Scott-Obregon conferences. Regard
ing the progress , of these conferences.
Secretary Ba-ker i said' General "Scott
was awaiting a communication from
General Obregon. Further than this
the secretary refused to: discuss the
status of the' conferences. '
Generals Scott and. Funston advis- I
ed .war departmeniNthat more troops j
were urgently needed, along - the bor- j
der-as- a return of the Big Bend raid- '
ers might be expected. It was upon
these recommendations thatN the
fresident and Secretary Baker decid
ed to call into- service the National
Guard of the three border states.
Secretary Baker described the new
troop movement as a step merely for
protection' of the border. He said he
had not heard whether the American '
troops in the Big Bend region had
actually crossed the boundary in pur
suit of the outlaws who raided Glenn
Springs and Bouquillas. ' '
"While Secretary Maker's statement
said, only two regiments of regulai-3
had been ordered to the border, or
ders actually were sent to three regi
ments. The secretary said an error
had been made in. preparation of the
statement. .........
The national guardsmen are order
ed out under the Dick law authoriz-
ing their service' anywhere in "the
United States but hot beyond the bor
der. Under, that law every man en
rolled in the regiments who is physi
cally able may be forced to serve. It
service beyond the border was con
tornplated the regiments would ba
mustered into the federal service as

According to the last reports to j
the war department the Arizona guard j
