Tho garbage collector starts out on
his Initial round today and will mnko
tho trip onco n week. Only a small
proportion of householders havo so
far provided themsolvcs with cans, but
the number Is increasing daily.
Street Commissioner Salisbury said
this morning that as ho understood It,
tho deposits In tho gnrbago receptacles
must not lncludo ashes, tin enns or
liko rubbish, but must bo only tho
garbage that comes, from tho kitchen.
If this is true, tho collection will bo
very light, nnd In tho caso of small
families the servlco will bo nil, for tho
offal from tho kitchen practically
amounts to nothing nnd this Is par
ticularly true if chickens aro kept.
Tno Tribune s idea of this gnrbago
question Is that cvorpthltig that comes
from- a houso during the summor
Bhould bo deposited In tho receptacles,
whother It bo ashes, tin cans, or old
papors. Tako for lnstnnco a can of
corn; what would uttract moro files
than that empty can if thrown In a box
or barrel or In a corner of tho back
lot?
Wo believe that as tho people aro
paying for this servlco they have a
right to demand that nil garbago that
oomcs from a houso -but not from a
stable during tho summor months bo
collected.
