BANDITS DESTROY

3 Troopers Killed,
Several
Bl Paso. Tex., May 8. Mexican
bandits crossed the nio Grande Fri
day night Into Brewster county, In
tho Big Bond country of Texas.
They raided and burned two fron
tier settlements, Glenn Springs and
Boqulllas, and n wax manufacturing
plant and a general store; killed
three troopers of tho Fourteenth Unit
ed States cavalry guarding Glenn
Springs, wounded three and made
prisoners of several, possibly three
or four. They shot to death, tho ton-year-old
son of O. G. Compton at the
Ellis & Woods wax plant, near Glenn
Springs, and carried off a man named
Deemer. who ran a general store near
Bouquillas.
The reports as to the number of
killed, wounded and captured are con;
Dieting. Oeneral Funston's informa
tion ia, however, that three soldiers
and a boy were slain in the surprise
attack, three wounded and two made
prisoners out of tho nine troopers sta
tioned at Glenn Springs.
Tronp A of the Fourteenth cavalry
are already striking south through
tho rough country from Alpine, Tex.,
en the Southern Paciiic railroad,
eighty miles north of the raided dis
trict and tho nearest railroad point.
Two more troops of the Fourteenth
are on their way by train from El
Paso to Alpine, and a machine gun
detachment Is hastening by railroad
from Fort Clark to Alpine. These
troops are commanded by Colonel
iTederick W. Sibley, whose orders
ro to get the bandits even if he has
to go into Mexico after them.
The banviits were either outright
Villistas or members of tho former
Carranza garrison at Vlncente. across
tho border from Boqulllas. It Is not
known precisely how many of them
attacked tho settlement. Genera!
Funston hears that 200 horsemen
were In tho party, but doubts that bo
many took part. He believes that
fifty would be nearer the truth.
They forded tho river at a point
south of Terlingua, Tex., rode north
for a few miles and then turned east,
taking an old wagon road which
winds through the hill country near
the river. At about 11 o'clock on Fri
day night they reached tho little town
o.' Glenn Springs, where nine troop
ers of tho Fourteenth cavalry under
Sergeant Smith were encamped just
outside the town.
Attack a Surprise.
Tho attack was a complete surprise.
Tho troopers, fired on from all sides,
tried first to save their horses. Pri
rates Cole and De Fries of the de
tachment were killed near tho corral
whilo trying to drive tho horses into
the open country. Probably every
man in tho detachment would have
been killed had tho Mexicans not sot
fire to the frame shacks of tho settle
ment and to tho cavalry tents. Hid
den by the smoke tho uninjured and
the wounded who wore able to drag
themselves along escaped to cover of
rocks and brush, and did such effec
tive work with their rifles that the
Mexicans quit the fight after a three
hours' battle.
Nono of tho reports state how many
of the bandits were killed and wound
ed. Sergeant Smith and his men had
to take to cover so quickly that ttero
was no time to save side arms. All
they could keep In tho rush to cover
was their rifles and ammunition belts.
After the bandits rode off with their
cavalry horses Sergeant Smith, him
self wounded, managed to put two of
the wounded troopers upon n motor
ttuck and drovo It to Marathon, tho
nearest settlement to tho north.
After burning tho few houses In
Glenn Springs and destroying tho cav
alry enmp. tho Mexicans attacked the
Kills & Woods wax manufacturing
jlant, several miles from Glenn
tarings, which is Just east of the

settlement and around a mountain.
The wax plaint was burned to the
ground and the bandits shot the ten-year-old
son of O. G, Compton, an em
ploye of tho plant's owners, one of
whom, Wood, is a veteran of the
Philippine lighting and had served un
der Funston.
Finishing with the plant, the raid
ers turned south to Boqulllas. which
is one of the two most Important set
tlements along the Texas-Mexican
border, in what is known as the Big
Bend country.
RAID CAUSES STIR
New
Punitive Expedition
Mexico Predicted.
Into
Washington. May S. The report o!
the new violations of United Stutes
sol) and the killing of four Americans
f:om a quarter most unexpected and
in which General Carranza had de
c'ared he had complete control
against outlawry, occasioned great
surprise here. Important changes In
border patrol forces, with possibly an
other punitive expedition into Mexico
in the Big Bend region of Texas,
v.here the Glenn Springs and Bo
nulllas raids occurred, with Presidio
an a base, were predicted.
Conferences between Generals Scott
and Obregon regarding tho Texas
i aids, It Is believed, will only slightly
delay conclusions of their protocol. A
message from General Scott was In
terpreted as meaning an early rati
ficatlon of the agreement. It was un
derstood that General Sott reported
the minor phraseology changes sug
gested by General C,arranza to Gen
ual Obregon. A. reply was sent Gen
eral Scott by General Bliss, acting
Ohief of staff, which may result In
conclusion of the protocol at tho next
conference.
Secretary of War Baker returned
from Cleveland today to direct steps
necessary as a result of the Big Bond
incursions. General Funston reported
that a movement of a considerable
force of border troops had been or
dered. FUNSTON REPORTS

Ground For Hours.
Washington, May 8. Eight Ameri

report from General Funston which
reached the war department. Al
though three troopers were kill
ed, one wounded and oqe captured,
the fight did not stop until tho Mex
leans set lire to the quarters whero

Had Continued For Two Days Ger
mans Very Active Farther to the
East.
Paris, May 8. The German attack
on Hill 304, on the west bank of the
Meuse, which was begun by the Ger
mans last Thursday and resulted Fri
day In the capture of French posi
tions on the north slopes of the hill,
was continued Saturday and Sunday,
the attacking forces making another,
gain to the east of the hill.
The assault which gained this lat
est success for the crown prince's
troops on this side of the Meuse was
made after an extremely heavy bom
bardment, which had continued un
ceasingly for two days. The front at
tacked extended from Hill 304 to Lp
Mort Homme, with the valley of the
Bethincourt brook in the middle of
the line.
At first all the German attacks
were repulsed, but after these had
been repeated timo after time the at
tacking forces won a foothold in the
French positions on the eastern
elopes of the hill as they slope down
toward the Bethincourt brook.
Another German gain is announced
en the east bank of the river between
the Bols de Houdromont and Fort
Eouaumont. This gain was made on
a front of some 550 yards in the re
gion of the Bois de Houdromont, form
ing tfl western part of the front at
tacked. The offensive on the eastern bank
of the river was preceded by a violent
artillery preparation and was repeat
ed several times over the whole front
of attack without success before the
gain was made on the western flank.
Further to the east the German guns
were very active at the base of tho
heights of the Meuse, but no Infantry
were made In this region.

MAY WRITE
ANOTHERNOTE
President To Discuss Matter
With Cabinet
Said to Feei That German Reply
Needs Elucidation.
CERTAIN POINTS NOT CLEAR
Erlln't Latest Communication, Whllo
Averting Danger of Immediate
Break In Diplomatic Relations, Held
to Have Left the Whole Status of
the Submarine Issue On an Unsat
isfactory Basis.
Washington, May 8. President
Wilson has virtually decided to writo
another note to Germany.
Though the German reply to tho
president's "ultimatum" pledges the
imperial government to suspend Hie
gal methods of submarine warrare,
and thereby has averted an Immedi
ate break In diplomatic relations, It is
regarded here as having left tho
whole status of the submarine Issue
on an uncertain and unsatisfactory
basis. In addition, it Is explained,
the German note is so worded as o
make elucidation necessary. What
the tenor of the president's next com
munication to Germany will be has
not yet been decided It probably will
he discussed at tomorrow's cabinet
meeting.
Tho president's oflVial advisers are
saldto entertain two distinct views In
-regard to It. One view is that the
president should accept the substance
of Germany's pledge at its face valuo
and express gratification on the part
of the United States for the decision
which .the imperial government has
reached. Coupled with this expres
sion of gratification may go a declara
tion of confidence that the pledge will
be scrupulously kept and the misun
derstanding between the two govern
ments over the submarine Issue hap
pily disappear
A general statement reiterating tne
purpose of the United States govern
ment to see that International law is
not violated by any of the belliger
ents, so far as .American rights are
concerned, is regarded as sufficient to
cover "Berlin's reference to the Brit
ish blockade.
Another View.
The other view Is that the presi
dent should briefly inform Berlin that
the United States has noted Ger
many's pledge to suspend illegal sub
marine operations, that this govern
ment fully expects this pledge to be
carried out for reasons of "human
ity," aside from other considerations,
ajid that the United States can not
regard Germany's pledge as condi
tional upon the result of negotiations
which the United States might under
take with another belligerent
At the same time the president
j probably will geek explanation from
J the imperial roverninent on certain
I points In the German note which ".re
vegue and subjected to several inter
pretations. There is anparently nc
desire here to tpiebtion the good faith
o' Germany's orders to submarine
commanders din-v'ni; that submarine
cperations be conducted according to
the general principles of visit and
search of merchantmen. But the Ger
man note contains the definite state
cent that orders to submarine com
manders, which bao been in efferL
right along. hr.e been to operate in
Kccordnncp with the general principles
of visit and seaich, excepting in the
case of enem "freighters in the w:r
z.me. Just what Germany means by
the "principles of visit and sear"h"
Is not understood here if the older
orders have '"ppn as Germany de
clares, In accordance with this prin
ciple. OF INJURY
