WASHINGTON, May 8. Adminis
tration officials are hopeful
that effective co-operation between
American and Mexican troops to ex
terminate the band of Mexican out
laws, which raided Glenn Springs,
Texas, last Friday night, will follow
tlio conclusion of the conference at
El Taso between Generals Scott and
Ohrenon. In the meantime, both at
the war and state departments, it was
stated officially that General Kunston
has full authority to send his troops
across the border on any hot trail.
Only meager details of the Glenn
Springs raid have reached Washing
ton. The latest was a consular report
from Ragle Pass saying that throe
civilians and three soldiers had been
killed and two soldiers wounded.
Consul Blocker's message said the
bodies of Deemer and Coy, two of the
civilians slain, had been found with
the throats cut. The other civilian
reported killed was the Compton boy.
The message estimated the force of
the raiders at one hundred and said
the women of Glenn Springs had been
sent to Marathon by motor truck.
Secretary Baker conferred with
President Wilson this evening, but he
sold later there had been no develop
ments In the situation. He declined
to discuss what steps had been taken
by General Funston or what recom

the court announcing today that it

Senator Lane of Oregon, a Demo

of tho senate to alleged injustice on
tho part of the Interior department In
J. miming through new Osage oil and
gns lenses in view of the fact that
Indians have already been offered
millions of dollars in excess of terms
as insisted upon by the department.
Senator lane called attention to the
fact that the department had attempt

miitiica Accepts German
"Abandonment Declara-
lion" in Lansing's Reply
Won't for a Moment Consider That Rights of American
Citizens Are Contingent Upon Conduct of Any Other
Nation, Official Communication Notifies,
RELIES ON "SCRUPULOUS EXECUTION"
Unlike Previous Communications, Note Is Short, Spicy
and to the Point; Would Not Discuss Part of Ger
manv's Answer to U. S. Government in Turn.
WASHINGTON, May 8. A noto eaMotl ly Secretary Lniisinpr
lo Ambassador Gerard ioday for delivery to the Herliii foreign of
fice informs tlie German government Hint the 1'nited States accept
its "declaration of abandonment" of its former submarine policy
niiil now relies upon a scrupulous execution of Hie altered policy to
remove the principal danger of an interruption of the good rela
tions existing between the two countries.
With this acceptance is coupled formal notice to Germany that
the United States cannot for a moment entertain, much less dis
cuss, a suggestion that respect by German naval authorities of the
rights of citizens of the United States on the high seas should in
the slightest degree be made contingent upon conduct of any other
government affecting the rights of neutrals and noneombatants.
Would Not Consider Part.
This is in reply to the concluding statement in the last German
note to the effect that, while submarine commanders had been
ordered to sink no peaceful freight or passenger-carrying ships
without warning or without safety for passengers and crew, the
German government would reserve to itself complete liberty of de
rision unless the United States was successful in its efforts to break
the British blockade.
Secretary Lansing issued a statement tonight saying that the
greater part of Germany's answer to the demand of the United
Slates was devoted to matters which the American government
could not discuss with the Berlin government, but he considered
Germany had "yielded to our representations," and that "we can
have no reason to quarrel with her" so long as the altered policy
is lived up to.
America's Last
WASHINGTON. May 8. Following is tho text of the noto cabled
today by Secretary Lansing to Ambassador Ocrard nt Berlin
with instruction to deliver It to the German minister of foreign affairs:
"The note of the Imperial German government under date of May
4, 1916, has received careful consideration by the government of the
1'nited States. It Is especially noted as Indicating tho purpose of the
imperial government as to the future that It 'Is prepared to Its utmost
to confine tho operation of the war for tho rest of Its duration to the
fighting forces of the belligerents' nnd that It Is determined tn Impose
upon all Its commanders nt seas the limitations of the recognised rules
of International law, upon which the government of tho L'nlted States
lias Insisted.
Let I'rli'iiiNliip Guide
"Throughout the moiilhs which hnvo elapsed since the imperial
government announced on February 4, IDlfi, Its submarine policy, now
happily abandoned, the government of the I'nlted States has been con
stantly guided and restrained by motives of friendship In Its patient
efforts to bring to nn amicable settlement the critical questions arising
from Hint policy. Accepting the Imperial government's declaration of
its nbnndonment of (he policy, which has so seriously menaced tho
good relations between the two countries, the government of the I'nlteil
States will rely upm a scrupulous execution henceforth of the now
altered pulley of the Imperial government such as will remove the
principal danger to an interruption of the good relations exltsing be
tween the 1'nited States and Germany.
.Must Prolcct t'ilincns.
"The government of the I'nlted States feels It necessary to state
thnt It takes it for granted 4 hat tho Imperial German government does
not Intend to Imply that the maintenance of Its newly announced policy
Is In any way contingent upon the course of, or result of diplomatic re
lations, between the governments of the I'nlted States and other bel
ligerent governments, notwithstanding the fact that certain passages
in the imperial government's note of I he fourth Instant might appear
to be susceptible of that construction.
In order. Iitiweicr. to avoid any possible iniMiiiilcrstuiidliig, the
government of I lie l ulled Stales notifies the iniierlal government that
it cannot for u moment entertain, much tx dlx iivs, a suggestion that
respect by German naval authorities for the rights of citicn of the
l ulled Stales upon the high seas should in any way or In the slightest
degree he made contingent upon the conduct of any other govern
ment allt'ttliig the rights of neutrals and noucoiiiliniunls. Responsi
bility in such matters is single, not joint; ulisolulis not relative."

when a messenger appeared at

out upon the desert sands the mighty
tribe of Khorassan Knights, their
Hongal tigers held In leash, moved to
ward Tulsa, the walls to lay level, the
city for their goal.
Hardly had this Toysl messenger
