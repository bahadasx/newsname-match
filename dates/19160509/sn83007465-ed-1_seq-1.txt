policy and now relies upon a
scrupulous execution of the altered

existing between the two countries.
With this acceptance is coupled

rights of neutrals and noncombatants.
This Is in reply to the concluding
statement in the last German
note to the effect that while submarine
commanders had been ordered
/to sink no peaceful freight or passenger
carrying ships without warning
.or without safety for passengers and
crew, the German government would
reserve to Itself complete liberty of
decision unless the United States was
successful In Its efforts to break the
British blockade.
Question of Performance
Secretary Lansing issued a statement.
to-night saying that the greater
part of Germany's answer to the demand
of the United States was demoted
to matters which the American
government could not discuss with
(the Berlin government, but he considered
Germany had yielded to our

po long as the altered policy Is lived

Following la the text of the note
cabled to-day by Secretary Lansing to
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin with
, Instructions to deliver It to the German
minister of foreign affairs.
"The note of the Imperial Germa.i
government under date of May 4,
1916, has received careful consideration
by the government of the United
States. It la especially noted, as Indicating
the purpose of the imperial
government as to the future, that It
'Is prepared to do Its utmost to ronline
the operation of the war for the
rest of Its duration to the lighting
forces of the belligerents' and that It
Is determined to Impose upon all Its
commanders at sea the limitations of
the recognized rules of Internationa!
law upon which the government of
the United States has Insisted.
"Throughout the months which
have elapsed since the Imperial government
announced on February 4.
1015. Its submarine policy. now hap
plly abandoned. the government of
the United States has been constantly ;
guided and restrained by motlvea of
friendship In Its patient efforts to
bring to an amicable settlement the'
critical questions arising from that
policy. Accepting the Imperial tror.
ernment's declaration of Its abandon- i
ment of the policy which has so seriously
menaced the good relations
between the two countries, the government
of the United States will rely
upon a scrupulous execution hence

Washington Expects Exter

Glenn Springs Raid.
United States Considers Funston
II; s Authority to Send
His Men fntn Mexico in Pursun?No
Official Answer From
First Chief.
Washington, May 8.?Administration
officials are hopeful that effective
co-operation between American
and Mexican troops to exterminate
the band of Mexican outlaws which
raided Glenn Springs, Texas, last Friday
night will follow the conclusion
of the conference at El Paso between
Gen. Scott and Gen. Obregon. In the
meantime it was stated officially that
Gen. Funston lias authority to send
his troops across the border on any
hot trail.
Secretary Paker conferred with
President Wilson to-night, but said
later there had been no developments.
Only meagre details of the raid
have reached Washington. The latest
ivns a consular report from Eagle
Pass to-day, saying that three civilians
and three soldiers had been

border.
No Sign of Increase
Officials would not comment on
border advices saying ("Jen. Funston

be strengthened. The question of calling
out a portion of the National
Guard is not under immediate consideration.
however, and as the only
ather means of adding materially to
the border guard would he to employ

there is nothing to indicate that flen.

diplomatic situation, and in the ScottObrogon
discussion. The right ?o

raids was clearly staated in
the original proposal from Carranza
and if Funston's men go across in
pursuing the Glenn Springs raider*
they will he covered by that agreement
regardless of the status of Gen.
Pershing's expedition.
Suggest ion of Treachery ^
Secretary Lansing declined t,ay
what steps were being taken fo investigate
intimations that the inspiration
for the Columbus raid or the
lllenu Springs raid had come from
the American side of the border
Any announcement, he said, m'rely
would serve to block the investigators.
Washington still was without official
notification to-night as to Carranza's
attitude toward the ScottObregon
plan. It was assumed from
the fact that another conference was
held to-day. however, that he batl
accepted the proposals. ?*??r??
Secretary Lansing forwarded representations
to Gen. CaiTanz*
through Special Agent Rodger* at
Mexico Cltv last night when news of
the Glenn Springs raid was confirmed.
The defacto government was
notified of the raid and it was indi?

Villa and Carranxn wore heard there
is nothing to indicate to what faction
they belong.
