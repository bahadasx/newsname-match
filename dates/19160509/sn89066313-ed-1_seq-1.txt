NUMBER 216
POLICE SEIZE BOOZE
Negroes in Automobile Had
124 Pints of Whisky, Plus
Wine and Beer.
GOT IT IN MOBERLY
Taxi Driver Says He Was
Paid S 10 for Ride Liquor
1 Ield at City Hall.
The olhce r Chief of Police John
U Whitesides in the City Hall looked
like a city bar-room this morning
when the liquor that was taken from
an automobile earl) this morning at
Moore's switch was jiut on display.
John Scott and Bnu Kelly, negroes,
who were in the car, are being held on
suspicion until a charge can be filed
against them. The car was driven by
a white man, Best Thomason, a local
tai driver who told the police that
the negroes paid him $10 to drive them
to Moberl) and return. He said that
he did not know what they were go
ing after
The police were "tipped off" by
omi one in Columbia that the liquor
was (oming here by automobile.
.Night Policemen Ficklin and Fenton
went to Moore's switch and waited
for the ear.
The li(iior consisted of 121 pints of
whisk), " quarts of wine and :: cases
of quart bottles of beer.
1 he negroes told the police that the
liquor was for their own consump
tion Scott was once convicted for
bootlegging
The nun were questioned for two
hours bv Major .1 M Batterton, Ct)
Attornej George Starrett, Assistant
Chief William Miller and Chief of Po-
lue John L Whitesides.
There is doubt at the police station
w hither the negroes can be convict
ed, since the.v were not caught sell
ing the liquor. The polke said that
it was up to the tit attorney to
bring charges against the men or let
them go.
Another question is: What is to be
done witli the liquor? The police said
that it will be destiojed if the men
are convicted of breaking the law, but
if no charges are brought, the liquor
will have to be returned to them.
