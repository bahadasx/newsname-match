El Phso, May 9.-Worklng with

to upset the peace negotiation! be

The decision to tend American
forcea from Marathon aerom the bor

conferees, coming face to fare with
-Carranza's request for a withdrawal
of troops and the meeting broke p.
Though no arrangements were
made for another session, there was
feeling that negotiations have not
yet been railed off.
Omclali said that Intervention
might be desired by European powers
who wish to have the United States
occupied on the Job tor the Influence
surh a campaign might have on the
American attitude toward the Euro

. American Interests owning huge prop
pertles In Mexico were regarded as
likely to want Intervention to re
.deem their holdings.
The force starting after the raid
era from Marathon Is regarded as
pitifully small. Funston Is unable
to reinforce the battalion, however.
"I have no more men to send."
lie said, despairingly.
The country ahead of the tiny col
umn Is the most difficult In the north.
There Is no forage en route. Chances
of catching the bandits are believed
small. That section of territory has
long been regarded as a refuge for
desparadoea from both sides of the
border. Funston felt secure regard
ing General Pershing's men, and ho
lleves that they arc able to take care
of themselves. Supplies are ample
for them and their lines of communi
cation moat efficient.
Generals Scott and Obregon today
sent to their respective governments
lengthy reports on Inst night's meet
ing. Interventionists are jubilant over
the new turn of affairs In the Mexl
tan situation. (Mayor Iea of El Piibo
expressed himself as being delight

move was a certain step toward ul

Washington, May 9. Secretary ot
War Oaker today announced that
President Wilson had authorized the
calling out of the Mllltla ot the elates
of Arizona, Texas and New Mexico
for service on the Mexican border.
Secretary ot Baker Issued the fol
lowing statement:
"The outbreak In the Big Bend dis
trict so further emphaslxed the dan
ger of similar ocenrrencea that the
president 'called out the mllltla of
Texas, Arizona and New Mexico and
directed them to report to General
Funston, who will assign them to
statlona along the border.
"In addition two regiments of re
gulars have been directed to proceed
to the border and such further ar
rangements will be made as may be
necessary to complete the security ot
the people against raids of this char
acter." The following unit of Infantry
have been ordered to the border:
The 30th of Piattsburg, N. T.:
Third of Oswego. N. T.; 21st of Van
couver, Wash., and the 14th ot Fort
Lawton. Wash. The mllltla of the
three states totals about 4.000 men.
JTlaker would not say whether the
orders were the result of General
Scott's menage. ' He declared they
were based on recommendations from
Scott and General Funston with re
gard to the Texaa raid. Baker would
not deny or affirm that General Obre
gon had demanded the withdrawal ot
American troops on penalty ot a
clash.
Arredondo named I. Vlllareal as
the principal agitator responsible for
the raid and plots. Tie said he had
no Indication of a further request
from, General Obregon or any Mexi
can officials that the American troops
be withdrawn. AH he knew was that
General Scott and Obregon were still
conferring. He urged that a larger
body of United States troops be sta
tioned to guard the American border
and watch the conspirators who were
among Carranzlstaa and Inflame bor
der sentiment. Lansing will take up
the charges Immediately with Secre
tary of War Baker.
Funston Is given full powers to
dispose of the troops as he sees best. 1
The forces are available for service
In Mexico If needed. The president's
step does not require action by con
gress unless the mllltla should cross
the border. In such event,, the na
tional guardsmen will be enrolled as
volunteers, losing their status as
mllltla. .

tire for the 43rd annual meeting ot
the state grange of Oregon. For the
first time since the organisation of
the grange, 43 years ago, the mem
bers have come to the banks of the
Kogue for their deliberation and
Granta Pass Is host in what It hopes
will not' be the last visit of the dis
tinguished gathering here.
The atate officials and a tew of the
committeemen arrived Monday morn

from the grange and from the Com
mercial club, and were taken to the
Commercial club rooma, which were
offered the grange as headquarters
during their stay In the city. At the
club waiting autos took the delegates

been opened to them, this placing of
the visitors being done as expeditious
ly as possible.

arrived on the trains from north and
south, and a few came by auto. Af

the stay In Grants Pass and all had
enrolled with the grange committees,
the first session of the state grange

those who know to be due. The
last day of the session, Friday, will
probably be one of the-most Interest
ing of the four, for 1t Is then that
questions of policy are discussed and
disposed of.
SINKING OF THE CYMRIC MAY TEST
KAISER'S NEW SHI POLICY
Washington, May 9. The hew Ger
man submarine policy may have been
tested In the case ot the British
steamer Cymric, torpedoed yester
day. If the submarine attacked the big
Whlte'Star liner without warning the
attack apparently violates the orders
to undersea boat commanders which
the German government declared had
been put Into effect. The fact that
there was no American aboard, of
ficial said today, does not enter the
case.
Germany has declared that it or
ders to submarine commanders were
Intended to confine their operations
to the fighting forces ot the bellig
erents. The Cymrlo was not a
fighter."

lematical. It there were any1 Ameri
cans ' aboard, quick disavowal and
reparation from Germany are expect

Pass Last Night, 'and Meet
This evening: a dinner will be
served at the old Dreamland rink,
building, the rains of the past few
day having made It necessary to
change from the Idea of an open air
basket picnic at Elverkl park. The
dinner will be the best opportunity
for the citizens to meet the delegates
socially, and a number of brief ad
dresses win be given. The visitor
wlll.be welcomed by Mayor Truax
and others, while the grange will be
represented by State Master Spence,
Hon. Jas. Stewart, of Fossil, and Mrs.
Anna It, Stevenson, of Portland.
Thursday afternoon the 'visitors
will be taken around the valley on
a sight-seeing auto trip. They will
also have an opportunity to hear

Incident, The status of German-American
relations today is as follows:
If Germany is unwilling to abide
by International law In Its submarine
operations except In return for suc
cessful United States negotiations
with England, she must say so de
finitely. By acceptance of President
Wilson's note with its declaration
that England' policies do not enter
into settlement ot the Issue, Germany
can bring the matter to an end.
Pending word from (Berlin, the
president assumes that this is Ger
many's intent. Full acceptance ot the
American terms Is anticipated by the
administration. Anything less than
that, officials say, Is likely to mean
the long threatened break.
