HOPKINS "BOYS"
"TOOK" C. O.
Bad Whiskey Causes East End Young
Men to Get a Trifle Gay Of
ficers Go After Them.
Deputy Sheriff W. S. Drye, and
Chief of Police B. D. Carter, of
Stanford, went to Crab Orchard
Tuesday morning with warrants for
James, Leonard, John and Yewell
Hopkins and Blain Skidmore, who
were charged by prominent citizens
of the East End capital with "tak
ing the town" there Saturday.
According to reports brought here
by men from the East End Monday,
the Hopkins boys, pretty well satu
rated with bad whiskey, rode into
town from their homes out in the
Green Briar section, near Dripping
Springs, and began creating a dis
turbance in town. When Marshal
Hamilton arrested one of them, the
others, forcibly took him away from
the officer, took the officer prisoner
themselves and threatened to lock
him up in the city calaboose if he
became obstreperous. After fighting
around the corner of Main and
Stanford streets a while, they got
in their wagon with the one whom
they had rescued from the officer,
and went home. Their father Joe
Hopkins, and their brothers, George
and Joe, are said not to have been
mixed up in the affair in any way,
and to have done everything in their
power to quiet the troublesome fel -
lows and get them out of town. The
father is a respected and quiet cit-
icu ui u.c jt, luu. v,,.C ui. Ule
boys is said to have been the man
wno siew tne marsnai at rerea some
time ago and is to be ti'ied for mur
der in circuit court at Richmond this
week.
Several of them were working in
-.. nzr.v ct- ,!..
and they knocked off work Satur-
day about noon. One report said
that they got in eight quarts of
whiskey Friday night and when they
quit work Saturday, had put most
of it away so that they are feeling
its effects considerably by the time
they got to town.
Citizens swore out warrants for
!-. be men at -once.- and an effort was
made to arrest some of them at the j
road works Monday, but when they'
saw officers coming, thev took to the
brush. Deputy Sheriff Drye and Of-'
ficer Carter hope to land them today. '
One of the Hopkins boys, called "Lit-
tie Joe," lost his home and two lit-'
tie daughters by fire a short time '
ago. He was not concerned in the J
trouble at Crab Orchard in any way.
LONDON CASHIER GUILTY
Says Jury in Federal Court To Be'
Sentenced This Week.
London, Ky., May 8. The jury in
the case of the United States against
McCalla Fitzgerald, a former cash-
ier of the First National Bank, which
failed here in April, 1914, brought

ments. He was charged with mis
appropriation of the bank's funds,
making false entries on the bank's
books, embezzlement, and making
false reports to the Controller of
the Treasury. The case had been
on trial all week and attracted much
interest on account of the promi
nence of the accused. After the
jury reported Judge Cochran left on
the 4 o'clock train for Maysville. Mr.
Fitzgerald will not be sentenced un
til this week, during the regular
term 01 court. , 1

B. Catching, former president of the
bank. Catching is under indictment
on several counts.

WHOOPING COUGH
"When my daughter had whoop
ing cough she coughed so hard at
one time that she had hemorrhage of
the lungs. I was terribly alarmed
about her condition., Seeing Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy so highly
recommended, I grt her a bott'e and
it relieved the cough at once. Before
she had finished two bottles of this
remedy she was entirely well," writes
Mrs. S. F. Grimes, Crooksville, Ohio.

FIRST DEFEAT OF SEASON
Deaf Boys' Nine Win Over Stanford
High By 5 to 1
The pitcher goes to the well once
too often. The Stanford High School
base ball team's splendid record of
unbroken victories all spring was
rudely shattered Friday. The ball
team of the School for the Deaf wal
loped the stuffin' out our lads at
Danville that afternoon by the score
of 5 to 1. The tale is soon told:
Stanford was up against some real
pitching and was only able to nick
Miller, on the slab for the mutes,
for three safeties,
The home team
found Bill Reinhart to their liking,
however, and early in the game piled
over their runs. The derrick had to
be applied to the kid pitcher, and
Joe Embry, who is the most versatile
player on the team, went into the
box, and held the mutes to only one
hit for the remainder of the game.
Embry showed high class as a twirler
and will undoubtedly be used in fu
ture games.
The strong Eastern State Normal
team of Richmond plays here this
afternoon, and a hot combat will un-
doubtedly be seen. Stanford nosed
out this team at Richmond several
days ago by hard work. The score
at Danville:

WARM CONTEST
IN LANCASTER
Saturday Over Election of School
Trustee Little Interest Here
C. O. Going Forward.
Very little interest was manifested
in the election of two school trustees
in Stanford Saturday. There were
only two candidates for the two va
cancies on the local school board W.
B. McKinney and W. C. Shanks and
they were re-elected without oppo-
j
son, receiving all the votes cast.
Hot Race in Lancaster.
One of the hottest elections ever
held at Lancaster was conducted
Saturday, it was reported by Gar
rard visitors at Stanford court day.
Dr. J. A. Amon was re-elected a
member of the board without opposi
tion, but Dr. W. M. Elliott defeated
J. W. Elmore for re-election by a
vote of about 150 to 50, it was re
ported. The issue is said to have
been the retention of the present
superintendent of schools there,
Prof. Kinnear, Dr. Elliott being op-
jposed to his re-election as head of
of the Lancaster schools, it. is said.
The full board in Lancaster is now
composed of Dr. J. B. Kinnaird, J.
A. Beazley, S. D. Cochran, Dr. Elli
ott and Dr. Amons. Quite a num
ber of ladies are said to have voted
2 I n tne election at Lancaster for the
first time.
Going Ahead at Crab Orchard.
At Crab Orchard there were three
candidates for two places on the
school board, W. E. Perkins and H.
G. Skiles being re-elected, with Pate
King running third. The trustees of
the East End school are all progres
sive business men and are proud of
the institution they have in charge.
They have just decided to make the
Crab Orchard High School a high
school in the full sense of the term
and will hereafter have a four year
term in the high school instead of a
two-year term. This will be a great
improvement. The old faculty has
been re-elected with Prof. U. G. Hat
field at the head of the institution
where he has done fine work. Miss
Bessie Moore of this city, who has
been teaching in the fifth and sixth
grades has been promoted-to-the-seventh
and eighth grades and an
other teacher will be added to the
faculty to take care of the lower
grades.
LATEST WAR NEWS.
The American Government has ac
cepted Germany's promise to bring
her submarine warfaro under the lim-
j itations of the recognized rules of
international law as insisted upon by
the United States, and Washington
E now relies upon a "Scrupulous ex
1 ecution of the altered policy." Ger
many is told in the note just for
warded to Berlin that the
United
States Government cannot entertain
a suggestion that respect for the
rights of American citizens on the
high seas should in any way be made
contingent upon the conduct of any
other Government affecting the
rights of neutrals and noncombat
ants. While the pursuit of Villa bandits
who raided Glenn Springs, Tex., was
continued yesterday, the conference
at El Paso between Gens. Scott and
Funston and Obregon and Amador,
Carranza representatives, ended
without an agreement being reach
ed last night, and will be continued
An entire system of trenches on
the slope of Hill 304 has been cap
tured by the Germans and the French
in the fighting suffered heavy cas
ualties. One thousand two hundred
and eighty of their soldiers and fifty
officers were taken prisoners. The
French have been strengthened by
the arrival of Australian and New
Zealand ti'oops.

Only a fair crowd was in town on
army horses and mules and secured
about a dozen from $100 to $125 a
head. The principal topic of conver
sation among Lincolnites was the
bond issue election to be held nex
Saturdav. Considerable orfcositior
seems to have developed to the queAf
beaten than that it will win

GEORGE BOHON
DIES IN MERCER
Brother of Dr. Tom Bohon of West
End and One of Wealthiest and
Leading Citizens of This Part
George Bohon one of the wealthi
est citizens of Mercer county, well
known in Lincoln county, died at his
home in Harrodsburg at 1 o'clock
Monday morning. Mr. Bohon was
65 years of age, and his death was
caused by acute indigestion. He had
been in poor health for three weeks.
Soon after his arrival home from At
lanta, two weeks ago, he was taken
East, where he consulted physicians.
It was decided that an operation was
not immediately imperative, and he
returned home. Sinpe his arrival in
Harrodsburg he believed he was im
proving. He is survived by his wid
ow, his daughter, Mrs. John H. Rain,
and two sons, Davis and Hanly Bo
hons, both of whom are in business
in Harrodsburg. He was born in
Mercer county and lived there all his
life.

Christian church. Mrs. Scott. Hud
son, of Atlanta, is a sister and Ra
ney Bohon, of Decatur, 111., Dr. Tom
Bohon, of Hustonville, and Will Bo
hon of Gadsden, Ala., are brothers.
Mr. Bohon was president of the Bo
hon Buggy Manufacturing Company,
and in this business he amassed quite
a fortune, which he invested in Mer
cer and Harrodsburg enterprises. He
was president of the Mercer National
Bank, a member of the School Board
and was closely identified with num
erous smaller busines senterprises.
For years he took a great inter
est in the Mercer county colony of
the Society of Shakers, whose ranks
were being rapidly thinned. He
made many fast friends among the
Shakers, and five years ago, in con
sideration of his caring for the sev
en or eight remaining members of
the colony for the balance of their
lives, he was deeded one-half of the
many acres of rich soil owned by
the society. This he was to have out
right upon the death of the last mem
ber of the colony. The remainder is
owned by Dr. William. Bennybaker,

IMPORTANT TO TAXPAYERS
Before you vote on the bond issue
Saturday, read carefully the follow
ing: The present bonded debt of Lin
coln county is $35,800.00 which
bears interest at the rate of 49c per
annum, amounting to $1,432.00 in
terest each year. (This debt con
sists of $8,000.00 of turnpike bonds
and $31,500.00 of Court House
bonds nearing a total of $39,500.00
with $3,700.00 in the sinking fund
leaving a net bonded debt of $35,
800.00.) Of the debt remaining
$8,000.00 is the residue of the $52,
000.00 bond issue of 1898, for the
purchase of pikes. The assessed val
ue of property of Lincoln county,
amounts to $9,000,000.00, the levy
for road purposes is 25 cents on the
$100.00 which amounts to an annual
tax of $22,500.00 and the State aid
is 5 cents on the $100.00, which
amounts to $4,500.00, making a to
tal of $27,000.00 available annually
to be spent on the roads of Lincoln
county to maintain, repair and ditch
same and build, maintain and re
pair bridges and culverts and pay
ing interest and creating a sinking
fund.
The proposed bond issue is for
$200,000.00. It is not known what
interest they can bear, but say they
are floated at 49c, then there would
be $8,000.00 interest on those bonds
and $5,000.00 each year to be set
aside to the sinking fund with the
interest on the $8,000.00 old bonds,
making a total of $13,320.00 to be
set aside before there could be any
money spent to maintain the pikes
and bridges.
In the past five years the average
expenditure on the roads of Lincoln
county has been $25,000.00 annual
ly. This would leave for annual main
tenance, the sum of $13,680.00, or
the other would reduce the usual
amount of money spent on our roads
to one half for maintaining them.

BY MAD BULL
Col. D. R. Moore Seriously Injured
But Is Now Sitting Up and On
Road to Recovery.
Col. D. R. Moore, one of the best
known farmers and stock raisers of
the Shelby City section, of this coun
ty, was severely wounded by an in
furiated bull a short time ago, and
is only able to sit up a little at times
now, though he is rapidly regaining
his strength. For a time it was fear
ed that his injuries were very seri
ous. He was found by a colored
man employed by Mr. Sam Bishop,
in an unconcious condition in a field,
the brute, though having no horns,
having severely butted him, and
trampled him with his sharp hoofs.
Mr. Moore had gone into a field to
separate the bull from a bunch of
steers. The bull was of the short
horn type, which is not usually fierce
like a Jersey. Before he could de
fend himself or flee, the animal at
tacked him, struck him down, and
Mr. Moore says that, he remembers
nothing more of the brute's attack
upon him, after that. The negro
hand heard him groaning and went
to his assistance. For some time he
j was unconscious, and it was agreed
by all that he had a very narrow es
cape. Although not a young man,
Mi-. Moore has a splendid constitu
tion, and it has greatly assisted in
pulling him through the fearful ex
perience. DR. HARVIELLE DIES IN DENVER

Stigall, an East End farmer and
stock trader, who weighs 350. They
made our corpulent townsman. M.

Best Thing for a Bilious Attack
On account of my confinement in
the printing office I have for years
been a chronic sufferer from indiges
tion and liver trouble. A few weeks
ago I had an attack that was so se
vere that I was not able to go to the
case for two days. Failing to get any
relief from any other treatment, I
took three of Chamberlain's Tablets
and the next day I felt like a new
man," writes H. C. Bailev, Editor
