It is n more familiar place;
A homo unhurt by sighs or tears,
Whcro waitcth ninny n well-known

With passing months It comes mora
near,
It grows more real day by day,
Not strange or cold, but very dear,
The glad home land not far away,
Where none nrc sick, or poor or
lone,
The place where we -shall find our
ovn.
And. as we think of all we knew
Who there have met to part no
more,
Our longing hearts desire home, too,
With all tho strife and trouble o'er."
