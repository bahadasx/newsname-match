WARRIOR BRAKES
WITH CIRRANZt
By Carl D. Groat
l.'nited l'res* Staff Correspondent.
WASHINGTON. May 9.—Gen. Obregon has demanded
that a time limit be placed on the stay of the American ex
pedition in Mexico. This the United States will refuse posi
tively. it was declared at today's meeting of the cabinet. Th«
policy will be continued refusal to limit the expedition's stay
south of the border.
Messages from <»en. Hugh Scott to the war department!
today indicated his conferences with (Jen.'Obregon had prob
ably ended, and that efforts to secure a j>eacc pact had been
shattered
The United Pre**- was told that Obregon had not actually
threatened to Carranzi'tas against United States troops
if net immediately withdrawn, a- had been reported, but had
said "the situation i- not all good and that wc might as well
prepare for trouble."
Believe Obregon Has Broken With
Carranza and Will Try to Seize Government
Army officials carefully concealed the contents of the re
port from < ien Hugh Scott. There was no mistaking that
its tone was very serious.
Obregon has broken with Provisional President Carranza
and has taken affairs into his own hands, is the view of many
here.
Report•> that a break wa- imminent had been widely cir
culated lately.
Obregon had an opportunity to rally certain leaders in
the North if lie so desired and many believe he is now in a
strategic position to gain control of the government.
Militia of Three Border States Called Upon
by President to Patrol United States Side of Line
For the first time since the Spanish-American war, the
president today called out the militia to aid the regulars in
the international crisis with Mexico.
The use of militia will not call for any action by con
gress at the present time, since the national guardsmen will
be used in patrolling the American side of the border.
The militia of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas, the three
'tates affected b\ the call, comprise 5,.Vt0 officers and men.
President \\ ilson also ordered four regiments of regular
infantry to the border.
The following units of infantry have been ordered to the
border: The Thirtieth, of I'lattsburg. N. Y.; Third, of Oswego,
V V.; Twenty-first, of Vancouver, W ash., and the Fourteenth,
of Fort l.awton, Washington.
The decision to call out the militia followed a conference
between Wilson and Secretary of War Baker after the latter
had received two code messages from (ien. Funston.
Mexican Ambassador Declares Raid Was
Engineered From American Side of Border
In announcing the move, Maker said the .step constituted
no change in the policy of the I'nited States toward Mexico.
Mexican \mbassador Arredondo told Secretary Lansing
today that he believed the raid on Cdenn Springs, Tex., was
engineered from the American side of the border.
He charged that 1. Yillareal was probably responsible,
asserting that Yillareal had attempted to stir up mutinies
among <ic facto troops.
