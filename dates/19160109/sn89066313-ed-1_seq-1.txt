who. after telling incidents of his
early life on the farm and declaring
for national preparedness as far as
reasonably necessary, told the ban
queters that the farmer of tomorrow
would be measured not alone by his
crops but by the roads and schools
and community life through which
the real advance of the American
farmer must be made.

peared on several programs earlier in i
the week. He suggested that the
farmer earn more than a mere living
from the soil: he must earn a profit.

in favor of a women's building for

Harvey of Kirks vil'e made an appeal
for real eommuniti life. She (minted
out that there are today in Missouri
10.000 one-room schoolliouses "unlit
for occupancy by glowing boys and
ciris." which are housing 200,000
school children and in which is be-
ing made an attempt to teach them
the duties of good citizenship.

He said that the problem of co-oper-

to the common advautace of the pro-

of the farmer and the brains of the

eether for the common good, he
