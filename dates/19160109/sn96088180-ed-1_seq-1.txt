Youngstown, O., Jau. 8. All hope
of Immedlute settlement of the big
' strike of ateel worker at Hunt
Youngatown went glimmering early
this e veiling when the strikers turned
down company offers of 22 vents an
,hour and stood out (or their original
demands of 25 cents.
With this derision fears grew that
rioting might break out anew tonight.
Youngstown, Ohio, Jan. 8.- A plot
to blow up tho Republic steel plant,
In the wake of a night or rioting, was
frustrated here oUy when disguised
militiamen overheard the plotters and
reported to their superiors. The first
or tho national guardiunou were Im
mediately detrained to guard tho
plant,
Twenty high salaried tube company
officials, with, annual pay ranging
from $5,000 upward, atoked furnaces
today. If tho Area were permitted to
die out the furnaces would be ruined.
Quiet prevailed during tho morning
following cessation or the last ot the
rioting about S a. m.
"There will be a strike of 30,000
steel workers In tho Mahoning valley
' within a week unless this trouble Is
' settled aoon," John Granry, local or
ganiser, said today. Tho strike wa4
called when the concern, an "Inde
pendent," rerused to grant tho work
' era' demands for 25 cents per hour;
they offered a compromise plan of
raising rates from 1914 tents to 22
cents an hour.
' After this plot had boon broken,
Brigadier-General 8ieaka dispatched
two of his companies to the Struth
ers' dam, 10 miles distant, as strikers
threatened to destroy It. Destruction
or the structure, 70 root high and
300 root long, would moon demoli
tion of tho town or Struthers.
No troops were sent to the busi
ness district lest their presence Incite
the strikers to new rioting. Most ot
the forces were maintained In the
tube plant, three miles rrom the ruin
ed district.

Ho was acquitted, however, of a libel
charge, and the kalner dismissed by
wholesale counts and princes or the

On December 1, 1911, Harden gave
the United Tress an exclusive Inter

between Germany and England was
Inevitable unless there was a com

policies. He said at that time:
"The kaiser has two Ideas that In
a war with England tne Muiiam-

support, and, second, that America
would help Germany. The Morocco
agreement and Italy's occupation or
Tripoli answers the first. The second
Is too absurd to consider. I have also

THEU.S.ARE
Differences Between Germany
and America Seem Near a
Settlement, With Overtures
Jest Made by the Teutons
(By United Prsss Leased Wire.)
Washington, Jan. 8. Complete and
final settlement of all submarine con
troversies with the central powers,
including the Persia and Lusltania
cases, seems near today, lonowinr
overtures from Germany yesterday.
Pessimism has been dissipated.
From Austria and Germany the
government has formal binding
pledges concerning future conduct
of submarine warfare in accordance
with international law. These were
contained in Austria's Ancona note
and In Germany'a submarine message
yesterday.
Now the administration is con
cerned only over reparation In the
Persia and Lusltania' cases. Ger
many's promised disavowal of the
Pesla incident If It should prove
oae of ber submarines was respon
sible, ia believed to be the forerunner
of similar action on Austria's part.
Having promised reparation in the
Lusltania case, the only thing now
necessary to a settlement Is a dis
avowal. Further evidence of the settlement
of the controversy came today in the
German note of November 30 in the
Wm. P. Frye sinking case, made
public by Secretary LanBlng. In this
waa revealed a complete agreement
with the American position, Germany
specifically agreeing that passengers
shall not be put to sea in small boats
unless the sea la calm and land near.
There was no authority today tor
the statemenftbat the administration
will not insist upon an unequivocal
disavowal ot the Lusltania torpedo
ing. Germany's promise of repara
tion may be considered sufficient,
however, to meet American demands
In the case.
The failure of Austria and Ger
many to receive any report of the
Persia sinking led to the belief that
the cause -may never be known.
Consul Gaulin, of Marseilles, re
ported that Rev, Homer Salisbury,
of the District ot Columbia, reported
missing in the Persia case, was travel'
lng under a London permit.

Toklo, an. 8. Emperor Yuan Shi
Kal of China was reported here today
to have fallen suddenly ill with
apoplexy. Though the story was un
confirmed, his illness was said to be
serious.
San Francisco, Jan. 8. The United
Press cable from Tokl3 reporting
Yean Shi Kal had been stricken with
apoplexy and was in a serious con
ditioa, created a stir In Chinatown
today and led to the prediction that
if the president-emperor dies China
wi:i be saved a prolonged revolution.
. ."The death of Yuaa at this time
would' turn the empire back into a
republic and restore peace in China,"
said Robert Park, managing editor
ot the China World.
Tne scheme to make China an
empire would fatl through and there
would be no need ot a revolution it
Yuan were to die," said Leong Kow,
editor of the Chinese Republic
Journal.
San Francisco, Jan. 8. Emperor
Yuan Shi Kal was reported in a Hong
Kong cable to the "China World" to
have conditionally resigned bis post
and appointed Luk Ching Tseng as
premier and secretary of foreign af
fairs. The story was that Yuan would
remain in power until April, wben a
new cabinet would be proclaimed, still
under the monarchial form of gov
ernment, and a successor to himself
chOBen.
Local Chinese ssaid that if Yuan
had even conditionally resigned, as
the cables said, he bad done so only
to stem the tide of revolution and
with the idea of actually continuing
in office, though technically and tem
porarlly out of power. They felt that
he considered himself certain ot be
ing returned to power in April.
Another cable to the China World
said British police from Hong Kong
turned the tide of battle against
Chinese revolutionary forces which
attacked the customs house at Kow
Loong. 10 miles from Hong Kong.
The cable' stated the rebels were
on the point of Investing the customs
house when, In response to calls for
help from the Yuan garrison, the
British police arrived and drove the
rebels away.
Two Europeans who were in the
customs house at the time ot the at
tack were reported safe. Both the
Imperial and rebel forces made light
ot their losses, the cable stated.
Yuan Is 56 years old. He became
permanent president ot China in 1913
and recently was chosen emperor af
ter elections determined In favor of
a change from a republic. He has
been In public service since his 23rd
birthday.
