YOUXGSTOWN. Ohio, January
8.?Ouiet prevailed throughout
the day. with members of the
Ohio National Guard patrolling
the principal streets of East
Youngstown, where last night
drink-crazed mobs ran riot, looting
and burning property and
causing the loss of one life and
financial loss amounting to $1,500.000.
but rumors of fresh
demonstrations tonight resulted
in renewed vigilance on the part
of the militia.
Meetings of strikers were held '
in the halls of the town this afternoon,
at which plans of action
were said to have been discussed.
It was also learned that employes
of plants in the Mahoning valley
now on strike will hold a demon- ,
* ? i
stration here tomorrow. According
to the plans, the men will assemble
on the outskirts of East
Youngstown and march past the
scene of last night's rioting and
on to a big hall here, where
speakers will address the crowd.
Regiment Held In Reserve.
Militia officers acknowledged that they i
had been informed of such plans, but ,
refused to indicate what attitude the 1
militia would take in the matter. They
admitted, however, that the 4th Regi- :
ment, composed of nearly 1,000 men, 1
was being held in reserve at Berlin
Center, fifteen miles west of here, for
any possible emergency.
Although troops began arriving here
about 5 o'clock this morning, none was
taken to East Youngstown for patrol (
duty until nearly noon, when Mayor W. i
H. Cunningham of that place request- -t
ed that militiamen replace police offi- f
cers thete, in order to permit the men
to get a much-needed rest. The re- *
mainder of the troops stayed on the 1
trains, which were backed into the 1
yards of the Youngstown Sheet and ,
Tube Company, where they will l?e ,
quartered while here. ^
Efforts on the part of the state to
effect a settlement between the strik- i
ers and the Republic Iron and Steel ,
Company and the Youngstown
and Tube Company will probably open
here tomorrow. Fred C. Croxton, state
mediator, is expected to arrive here ,
late tonight and every effort will be
made to settle the difficulties.
All the Saloons Closed.
For the first time in the history of i
the city saloons were closed iti Youngs- i
town on a Saturday, this action being '
taken by the city authorities in an ,
effort to prevent further disorder. Sa- <
loons in East Youngstown and Struth?? ?
were also closed, but those in Gi- 1
rard, five miles away, were open and
ears running to that town were
crowded.
Today was pay day at the plant of 1
the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company.
Owing to the burning of the .
pay office by the rioters last night, the
*r.<n were compelled to line up in the
st eets to receive their checks. 1
Reports from Struthers. where t
threats had been made to blow up the <
Yellow creek dam, which would result ,
in the flooding of the business section
of that place, said that it Wfcs quiet
there. A detachment of soldiers was
sent to that point today and, aided I
by armed citizens, planned to patrol the
district all night. {
2ijrhty-Seven Are Arrested.
Eighty-seven persons have been ar- I
rested in East Youngstown as a result 1
cf the riot. All have been transferred
to the county jail in Youngstown and
will be held pending the outcome of
their trials Every available cell and 1

use.

Germany Wearing Out

Gen. Joffre Asserts
PARIS. January 8.?A dispatch
to the Matin from Athens says
that the Patrls prints n statement

school at Athens* In nhlch Gen.
Joffre said t
"We have every reason to be
sure of final victory. We aTe beginning
to get proofs which show
beyond all doubt that German
power is waning. The signs are
such as cannot be mistaken by
competent persons. These signs
and proofs relate more particu;
larly to the morale of the Geei

MS PROPOSED
NEW SCHOOL LAW
Commissioner Newman Out'
lines Changes to Federation
of Citizens' Associations.
BELIEVED TO HAVE MADE
MANY FRIENDS FOR PLAI\
Resolutions Adopted Favor Consoli
dation of Car Lines and Building
of Big Auditorium.
Commissioner Oliver P. Newman las1
night explained to the Federation o:
Citizens' Associations the Commission
ers' plan for changing the school sys
term of the District.
The Commissioner unquestionably
made friends for the plan. The meet
ing -was largely attended by delegatei
as well as members of the various cit
iaens' bodies, many of whom assurec
Mr. Neirman after the proceedings thai
they had been won over to the proposed
legislation.
Answering the various criticisms thai
lave been made against the plan, Com-nissioner
Newman created something
>f a surprise when he declared that tc
crest the powers of the board of education
in the Commissioners would result
n giving the people of Washington s
more direct interest in school affair:
than they have at present.
Reasons for Statement.
He stated that whereas two of the Com
nissioners are required by law to be resi
lents of the District no such require
nent applies to the Supreme Court, whicl
appoints the board of education, and tha
Ive of the six members of the Suprenn
7ourt are r^on-residents of the District
S'ot alone this, but the president of th<
x>ard of education, Mr. Newman said, ii
i non-resident and votes in the state o;
S'ew Hampshire.
Among those who heard the address
was James F. Oyster, former presiden
r?f the board of education. The federa
lion extended an invitation to Mr. Oys
i.er and to Henry P. "Blair, president o
rne Doarti or education, to present then
views on the suggested changes in th<
uchool system at a meeting to be he!<
later in- the month.
Several important resolutions wen
tdopted. the most important ones fa
roring consolidation of the local stree
railway lines and the building of s
mammoth auditorium in Washington
Concerning the former President Clar
&nce P. King of the Washington Rail
ivay and Electric Company will b<
asked to address the federation at iti
next meeting.
School Committees Represented.
Representatives of the school commit
tees of a number of associations and o
the High School Teachers* Associatioi
were In the audience when Commls
Bioner Newman began his address
Urging that the reasons back of th?
Commissioners* recommendation b<
carefully studied before a decision t<
condemn the plan is reached, Mr. New
man said, in part:
"The reason that the Commissioners o
:he District of Columbia have recommend
cd to Congress that the control of al
pliases of the educational system be p!ace<
under the Commissioners can be Bummec
up in this sentence: "No institution or or
Sanitation of the size of the public schoo
system of the District can be administered
as well by two heads as it can be b:
one head."
"The principal objection of the Com
missioners to the present system is no
at all that the schools are conducted
by the board of education but tha
they are conducted by the board of ed
ucation and the board of Commission
ers. nougniy speaaing, the board o
education runs one-half of the schools
and the board of Commissioners runi
the other half. The boaird of Commis
[doners is absolutely Independent o
I he board of education. In many re
spects the board of education Is abso
lately independent of the Commission
ers. The exact line dividing the way:
in which the board of education Is in
dependent of the Commissioners is in
distinct and uneven; in fact, there is n?
su? h line, and can be no such line.
The board of Commissioners ant
board of education disagree, from tinv
to time, as to the extent of the inde
pendente of the board of education. A
one time that disagreement became ?
serious as to be injurious to the schoo
administration, and through it to th<
children. Fortunately the presen
board of education and the presen
board of Commissioners have got oi
together very well. There have beet
very few points of disagreement, an?
no points of serious conflict. This ha
been due, however, not at all to tlv
form of administration, with these tw<
heads, but to the personalities of th<
tuo bodies. Kach has appeared to b*
anxious to make the Illogical syster
work to make greatest possible degre
of effectiveness, and with the leas
possible amount of friction. The sys
t.?m does, >>owever, contain irc^gulari
ties and makes for almost inevitabl
disagreement, friction, lack of ?;o

; J. Ray Adams Is Making Effort
to Cure Chronic
[ Indigestion.
I J. Ray Adams, clerk of the Senate
committee on woman suffrage, last
; night completed twenty-four days without
touching food.
Mr. Adams is not fasting on account
of a bet, nor has he sworn off food until
the women are given the ballot. In
fact, he plans to begin eating again
. next Sunday morning, when he will
. have gone thirty days without food-of
i any kind. He is fasting because he be5
lieves that it will cure him of intestinal
1 indigestion, from which he suffered se[
verely before entering upon his period
. of fasting.
To look at Mr. Adams, you would
think that he had never fasted a day
' in his life. He admits, however, to
: having lost.eight or nine pounds so far.
"I am feeling fine, better than I have
felt'for months," he said, when ques"
tioned about his fasting. "I believe
that I could go down and swim the
, Eastern orancn or me foiomac river
tonight if I had to." x
1 Works All the Time.
i This is no Idle boast, for on Christmas
eve a year or two ago Mr. Adams
did just that thing, on a bet.
"I haven't had so much as a crumb of
t bread since I began my fast," he con.
tinued. "Every morning I take a large
i glass of hot water, and that is all I
t take during the day. For the first few
days I felt a little 'peckish,' but that
soon passed, and I believe that this
course of treatment will cure me of my
trouble entirely. Of course, when I be>
gin eating again, I will have to be
careful, and if I find that I am not
cured, I'll start on another fast.
"The finest dinner you could set out
wmiMn't temnt me to walk across the
room to get ft today. I know that I
cannot go on indeflnitel}' without food,
however, and that I will have to begin
? eating again some time."
i Mr. Adams has been constantly at
j work since he began his fast, and he
takes some exercise every day. In
: most cases of prolonged fasting the
fasters fake to their beds, but Mr.
J Adams doesn't feel the need of such a
J step at at!, he says.
' BRITAIN SEEKS TO BAR
, SPECULATION IN COPPER
LONDON, January 8.?With a view to

has notified consumers in Great
Britain that they must not purchase
more than fifty tons of copper in one

It appears that the British authoriJ
ties recently bought, mostly fn Ameri
ica, refined ^copper for delivery over
? the whole of the present year at a
; price which would enable the governi
ment to supply its munitions contractt
ors at ?100 per ton. As much as ?116

Guarantees of Safety

OFFICIALS ARE PLEASED
AT LAST GERMAN NOTE
Assurances Regarding Conduct 'of
Submarines Presage Satisfactory
Solution of Controversy.
Encouraged by the conciliatory attitude
shown by Germany and Austria
in rec :nt diplomatic exchanges with the
United States, officials are considering
requesting a definite and comprehensive
statement pledging not only Germany,
bur. all of her allies, to respect,
in the conduct of their sea warfare, the
guarantees as to the safety of American
life, for.which this government has
contended throughout the entire submarine
controversy.
President Wilson is being urged by
some of bis close advisers to ask the
Germanic allies for definite assurances
that no unarmed ships with Americans
aboard shall be destroyed by any of
them until the passengers have reached
a place of safety.
Attitude of the President.
The President is said to look with
some favor upon such a proposal, but
has reached no decision. In any case,
he probably will take no steps in that
direction until details of pending negotiations
with these countries have been
cleared up.
Officials are particularly gratified
over Germany's latest note on the destruction
of the American ship William
P. Frye, made public yesterday, because
of its acceptance of the principle that
the mere placing of non-combatants in
lifeboats before a prize is destroyed
is not a sufficient guarantee of safety.
Prospect of an Adjustment.
This concession, coupled, with the
offer of Germany to pay Indemnity for
the Lusitania victims and Ambassador
von Bernstorff's assurances regarding
the conduct of German submarines in
the Mediterranean, has contributed
greatly to the feeling that a satisfactory
solution of the entire problem

strengthened by Austria's deference in
the second Ancona reply and the assurances
of Baron Zwiedenek, the
Austrian charge here, that if it developed
that an Austrian submarine
sank the liner Persia he had no doubt
personally that full satisfaction would
be give*.
No further details regarding the
Persia incident reached the State Department
yesterday, but there has been
an apparent lessening of tension as
the days have gone by without any
official confirmation that it was a torpedo
and not a mine that sank the
ship.
BREAD CARDS FOR SWISS
NOW BEING CONSIDERED
GENEVA, Switzerland, January 8.?
The federal government is seriously
considering the establishment of a system
of bread cards similar to that of
Germany because of the high price of
wheat in Switzerland. The rise in cost
of the grain has resulted from congestion
of traffic on the Italian lines,
where large quantities of cereals destined
for this country are held up.
Heavy consignments of wheat are in
French as well as in Italian ports
awaiting shipment.

Joint Committee's Recom- I
to
mendations Passed. *
i:
p
House leaders on District of Columbia
matters have about concluded that
the surest manner to get the recommendations
of the joint fiscal commit- ^
tee through the House will be to tack
the legislation on the forthcoming Dis- p
trict appropriation bill. A
This statement is made aftet inter- r
views with Representatives Johnson of J
Kentucky and Page of North Carolina, q
after both of those members had con- o
ferred at length upon the subject late I
yesterday afternoon. It developed that *
there is a unity of purpose between the
two committees represented by these s
two chairmen, and that they both want g
to take the shortest cut by which the 8
joint committees report can result in p
enactment. E
Obstacles to Legislation. I
There are obstacles in the way of any ^
legislative enactment, however, and n
these are being studied now by mem- ii
bers of the committees, especially by n
the two chairmen mentioned. One is 81
that the rules of the House will not 0
permit legislation on an appropriation ii
bill, and whenever there is legislation I
on an appropriation bill it is probably Jfj
there because no one took advantage of f,
the rule to knock it out or because si
maneuvering and jockeying between
Senate and House forced the bill into a
position where it must pass with the
legislation or fall. Appropriation bills, P
of course, cannot be allowed to fail of h
passage. B
There is a rule, however, that per- ?
mits legislation on an appropriation
bill when the legislation is designed to
reduce expenses. Chairman Johnson ?
has said that he believes the commit- **
tee's report in legislative form could .
be inserted in the appropriation bill
under that rule.
Favorable Report Necessary.
The House will probably not accept A
as an amendment to the District ap- "
propriation bill the recommendations ft
of the joint committee in legislative tl
form unless a favorable report comes v'
from the District committee. That Is.
there would have to be a special rule B
from the rules committee permitting *'
the lawmakers to add the legislative
matter to the appropriation bill, all of II,
which would be cumbersome and take tn
time. "j
However, Representative Johnson is already
to go to the rules committee, p?
with Representative Page, if needs be. hi
and ask for the special rule. This may t"
eventually occur. In the meantime the ki
District bill will be held up until the ki
District committee has made its fa- 1,1
vorable report on the necessary legislation.
The other matter of difficulty is the
proposed inheritance tax. It is easy to ,
write the other legislation in the committee
report, but the subject of an In- cc
heritance tax is bothersome. Repre- d<
sentative Johnson is studying the w
statutes of states where such a tax is re
in effect and will have a draft of a w
section of the bill within a week poe- ?
slbly.

pedal Cablegram to The Star.
PARIS, January 8.?Your corespondent
is now permitted to
nnounce what has been the subect
of secret congratulation to
nembers of the clearing house
nd the American Red Cross. It
5 of interest because it is a most
emarkable tribute to American
fficiency. That an American
msiness man should prove effiient
is not surprising, but the
ompliment is remarkable on acount
of the source from which it
omes. It is of interest also beause
it probably means that the
ives of hundreds of thousands of
tarving Serbians will be saved.
The German government has
nvited H. C. Hoover, who for
ourteen months has directed the
elief of the people of Belgium,
o feed and protect the destitute
>eople ot berbia.
A Hi? Arc Seeking Motive.
This tribute from the Teutons to the
nan who has stood between them and
heir victims is probably the most renarkable,
if not the only exhibition of
onsideration and tact shown by Germany
since the war be gran. It is remarkable
that the clearing house and
he French and English governments,
rho will be expected to finance the reief,
are investigating to find some
notive for Germany's offer other than
ympathy for the suffering Serbians.
<ike the man who was offered a cigar
y a not too generous friend, they are
sking:
"What's wrong with it?"
The clearing house, acting in conunction
with the Rockefeller Foundaion,
the American Red Cross and the
Iwiss committee for the relief of Serian
refugees, has found the work of
ssisting the Serbians in their invaded
ountry one of extreme difficulty. This
s due to reasons partly geographical,
artly political.
Method of Reaching Belgium.
For purposes of relief it has been

>y the neutral waters of the Scheldt,
nd to distribute food by means of her
wn system of canals. Supplies from
America taken on board at New York
equired no handling. At Antwerp the
argo could be broached and sent into
he interior by rail and canal boats,
if more importance was the fact that
<f the two powers that have kept the
Belgians alive?France and England?
he boundaries of the one join her on
he west, the other is separated from
er only by a ferry. Lacking the asistance
of the French and English
overnment, Belgium would have
tarved.
Mr. Hoover, acting as the agent of the
eople of America and the French and
English governments, has each month
istributed to the destitute Belgians
10,000,000. Of this the money sent from
Lmerica, even including the 14,000,000
ontrlbuted by the Rockefellers?the
lost abused of our royal families and
i this war the most generous?would
ot have kept the Belgians alive for
even weeks.

but who have learned in
Washington during the past two
weeks to describe themselves as
pan-Americans, gathered in the
large ballroom of the New Willard
Hotel last night at a banquet
which marked the end of the
second Pan-American Scientific
Congress, and heard, under the
most solemn circumstances, a
plea for increased military preparedness
for all of the American
republics.
It was made *by Judge
George Gray of Delaware,
chairman of the United States
delegation to the congress,
presumably, because of his official
position, with die sanction of
the government ot the United
States, and was the outcome of a
discussion by him and other
ciwatrrc nf what was dcscrihed
as now existing in Europe?"the
disregard of those restraints
which civilization and humanity
were supposed to have placed
upon the war lust of belligerent
nations."
Need Strength at Sea.
"Whatever position we assume/'
Judge Gray said, "there can be no
doubt that we of the Americas will
present a united front to the nations of
the world. In order that we may do
this, I venture to say, in behalf of this
country at least, that it is our duty to
so strengthen our sea power, south as
well as north, that we may protect the
commerce that traverses the high seas
and the ocean paths that are open to all
neutral nations."
Robert Lansing, Secretary of State of
the United States, presided at the banquet,
which was a great state entertainment
by the government of the
United States, with the Secretary of
State and the United States delegation
to the congress just ended named as
the official hosts, and which was given
in honor of the Latin American delegates
to the congress. Mr. Lansing,
who has had little opportunity during
his incumbency of office to practice
public speechmaking, and who was
hampered in his position last night as
toastmaster, as any Secretary of State
or minister of foreign affairs must be.
by the veiled allusions in which it is
necessary for such an official to speak
in public on subjects of international
affairs, nevertheless fourjd that those
whom he addressed were in thorough
accord with him, and the position he
has won with the distinguished Latin
American visitors during their visit
here was made plainly evident by their
frequent and generous applause.
Secretary Lansing's Address.
He told the Latin American visitors;
"We shall not forget you and we hope
you will not forget us. Every mail
loves his native land above all others.
We call that patriotism, and the destiny
of a nation Is in the hearts of its
people. Yet, how can a man better testify
to his patriotism than by strength'ening
the bonds which bind our republics?
1 hope each of you will go home
i as an apostle of pan-Americanism,
' teaching bis fellow-citizens the truth
as to other republics, wiping away every
suspicion, every doubt. Pan-Americanism
ought to be the guardian of
our mutual interests and the hope of
the Americas for all time."
These statements were made in the
Secretary of State s opening aaure?? <11
the banquet. He was followed by Eduardo
Suarez-Mujica, ambassador of
Chile, who is the president of the congress;
by Judge Cray, by Frederieo
Acosta, minister of foreign affairs of
Costa Rica, who has been attending the
congress as min ster of Costa Rica on
special mission to the United States; by
Ignacio Calderoti, tlie minister of Bolivia,
and by Dr. James Brown Scott,
secretary of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace. As a surprise, #
and in response to requests, Mr. lousing
called on John Barrett, director
general of the Pan-American Union and
secretary general of the congress, who
had not been on the program. He was
found in the lower part of the hotel
attending to administrative work of
the congress and made a speech,
in which he paid special tribute to the
State Department officials for the way
the congress has been handled, especially
to William Phillips, third assistant
secretary, who was charged by
Congress with much of the work. Mr.
Barrett also especially thanked Mrs
Lansing for the great work, he pointed
out, accomplished by Thw as chairman
of the woman's auxiliary and the woman's
entertainment committee, and he
called especial attention to the work of
the clerks, stenographers, translators
and other assistants. He spoke of liis
great love for his work in connection
with Latin American affairs, and expressed
the joy at seeing the accomplishments
of the congress. Mr. Barrett
was much affected, and so wws
