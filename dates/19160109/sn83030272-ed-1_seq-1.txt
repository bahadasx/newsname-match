i CRITICISM OF CITY'S
Stale Comptroller Travis's attack on
tile financial administration of New York
..i... , , , , , . ,
city drew a broadside In return from
Comptroller Prcndcrgast last night. Mr,
Premlergast challenged the State Comp
troller to make public the vouchers of
the. expenses for the commission that
had charge of New Voik's exhibit at San
Francisco and said that the. trips Mr.
Trails and his deputies made to San
Francisco "weie the cheap graft that Is
enjoyed sometimes by Sunday school
politicians of Mr. Travis's type."
Comptroller Premlergast .defended the
city's salary standardization programme,
which he said Mr. Travis was unable to
comprehend, accused Mr. Travl" of ex
travagance In his own State department
and declared that Mr. Travis's otllce "Is
still a tomh tilled with the rattling bones
f allc,.llt um) hsolete methods." Tho
Premlergast statement In part follows :
"Comptroller Travis Is undoubtedly
engaged In the old gam- of trying to
draw a red herring across the tiall. He
unows we arc on his trail as far as the
expenditures of the Stale of New York
at the Panama-Pacific Imposition arc
concerned.
"Some months ago, believing that the
city had a right to know how Its money
waa being expended. I ticked Mr. Travis
to let Us examine the vouchers of the ex
pence for the exposition commission.
He gave permission to examine the
vouchers up to a certain point, but when
'vvv got beyond that oliit he said the
ouclieis were not available. Now I am
going to ask Mr Travis why tltee
vouchers are not available, as they are
public records the moment they pass Into
his custody.
Isn't Dollar rti'ipoiislhlHty .
"The Stair Comptroller cmnot es
cape responsibility by lefetrlng to the
law under which these expenses were
authorized. That law Is Just like a lot
of other laws passed bv the State I.esls
lature. It offers little If any protection
to the public us far as preatidll Is con
cerned, but with a vhlle personality In
the office, of the state Comptroller, who
Is thinking of the people's Interest and
not of his own political prospects, or lack
of prospects, one or two good strong
worda spoken by hint In public would
have the effect of preventing unneces
sary expenditures, no matter what coloi
of legality might be urged for them.
"No such word was spoken. Mr
Travis was supinely silent all spring
and summer while officials from the
Stale with their families mid friends
were travelling all over this couniiy it I
tli4 State's expense. He and all his
deputlea made trips to Salt Francisco,
lie knows Unit those visits were not re-
mired bv tae nubile Interest. i ney

and his deputies were In San Kranclsco
they looked over the accounts of the
commission 's baldet.l.ish, bccitise we
know that If In- did look ov.r the ac
counts they would mean nothing lo him.
"If Comptroller 'Tnivls had a Hue
conception of Ills' duties he would never
have refused to ptodun- theso vouchers
and permit copies to be mad of them
tho first time he was asked, and the
fact that he has not produced them up
