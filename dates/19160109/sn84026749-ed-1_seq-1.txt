To make Washington a great Gov
ernmental industrial center:
To preserve its character aa a smoKe
lesfl town and a beautiful city:
To make it an example of the best
modern development in Industrial
methods and economies; and finals
To establish hero a system of model
industrial welfare work that shall ne
a lesson nnd an Inspiration to tno
wholo nation.
Such Is the big conception that tne
District government entertains concern
ing the next evolution of the Xatianat
Capital toward the destiny that is do-
lleved to be In store for It.
All this la an Incident to the present
consideration of the proposal to mane
Washington another electrical city.
To Harness the Potomac
Discussion has lecently turned ai
tttitlon anew to the vast possibilities or
hydro-electric power in determining the
character of Washington In the future.
Time was when It was esteemed im
possible for Washington ever to nave
any commercial or 'industrlalo-lmport-ance.
because commerce and industry
means smoKp. nnd this la and wilt re
main a smokeless town.
But there Is no smoke Incident to the
use of electric power, and Washington
has at Uh door one of the greatest un
devlopd'eources of electrical energy
that tha country "boasts,, in the Potomac .j
The new conception of Washington aa
model Industrial establishment of 'the
Government Is based on the purpose to
harness, not merely the nower of the
Great TVUJs of tho"Potomac, at the ack
dor of Washington, but the still greater,
pctcntlal powers that are. offered by iho
Potomac all the "way up stream from
thui city to Harpers Ferry, and beyond
that bv the .Shenandoah and Pqtomac,
whase point of confluence la there.
The Potomac and Shenandoah have
for generations been recognized an two
of the finest power rivers In the coun
try. Their heavy fall, rock beds, -and
mountainous banks Invito development
of water powers every few miles. Either
stream cottid be converted Into a succes
sion of lakes bybulldlng proper dams,
from the overflow of which almost un
told power could be developed.
Outlived the Day of Smoke.
Under the modern system of tying
those unit together th( aggregate of
this power could bo concentrated wher
ever Its application was desired. Thus
Washington could be made the bene
ficiary of this natural resource, and in
addition to operating the public utilities
of the ct9, there would be a great sur

Story of His Remarkable Single-Handed Fight
For His System and Supt. Whittaker's .
Analysis of it Comprise Interesting
Chapter in Prison Annals.
AUTOCRACY VERSUS
Osborne is deposed and

There is the big fact and the big question behind the
biggest mixup that marks the climax of the biggest job of
prison reform ever undertaken in this country.
With the removal of Thomas Moft Osborne as head
of Sing Sing prison began a firecracker series of events that
culminated in the deposition of the State superintendent of
prisons of New York by Governor Whitman. And the end
is not yet.
It is not the political aspects of the case that penolo
gists, civic, charity, social service and civic workers all over
the country are watching. They are asking the single question :
f'Will the Osborne system live?"
Osborne himself says that is the point at issue.
Down at Occoquan, where the District workhouse is located, a man as eminent in
his field as Osborne, W. H. Whittaker, has been working out an experiment in prisonre-
form as notable in its way as

Lack of Protest by Prisoners
Shows Method Was Right,
Friends Say.
Two nnd a half years airn a Sing Sins
warden made an admixture of humanity
with prison discipline. A few months
afterwnrd he was displaced. Hla kind
ness had made him Immensely popular
with the convlcta. The moment he was
put out anarchy possessed the prison
and held It In Krlp for weeks. Murder,
mutiny, and arson followed tho removal
of Jh" s; Kennedy.
Three of tho moat
important shons In
the Industrial section of tho prison were
set ablaze In one day. Gleefully the
convicts manned the hose and by wilful
misdirection let the buildings burn to
the ground. Tho warden was under
grand Jury lire. Inmates who had tes
tified against him were knifed In their
cells.
For days and nightH without let the
prisoners held their keepers at bay.
So veritably waa it a reign of terror
that a battalion of naval mlllttal slept
In their armory at Osslnlng, the village
that contains the prison. They were
ready at a minute's notice to protect
the countrysldo against an expected
jail delivery. The convicts' conspiracy
for a general break failed, but there
were a number of escapes,
