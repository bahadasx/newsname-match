THE HACl'E, Jan. S (Via London)
Five weeks after its departure
from New York, the Ford peace ex
pedition reached The Hague today.
The members of the party plan to
begin immediately the work of
spreading the peace propaganda.
The trip from Copenhagen in a
special train through Germany,
touching Luheck. Hamburg and lire
men, was filled with impressive sug
gestions of war. At the important
stages the American peace advocates
passed trainloads of soldiers bound
for the front and Red Cross nurses
in hospital coaches.
The progress of the expedition
through Germany was watched by
silent crowds, except at ono place
where a German lieutenant lifted his
helmet and wished success to the
project. The entire trip over German
territory was made after dark.
Arriving at the German port of
Warnemuende in a ferryboat from
Denmark, the Americans with the
Norwegian, Swedish and Danish del
egates, were met by a special train.
The train which was provided by
special permission of the military au
thorities, stood on the dock sur
rounded by soldiers. As the peace
advocates stood on the platform in
the dusk in a drizzling rain -hey
were selected one by one, as their
names were called and permitted to
go aboard the train. Then the train
was
the
locked and started quickly for
trip across Northwestern Ger-
many.
After a while the military guards
on the train relaxed the rules and
permitted the travelers to look out
of the windows. In the brilliantly
lighted stations at Lubeek, Hamburg
and Bremen, the pilgrims caught
their first glimpses of military activ
ity. Groups of Red Cross nurses
were seen on the platforms: soldiers
were leaning out of the windows of
incoming and outgoing trains; the
familiar gray coated German offi
cers were pacing back and forth and
frequently a crowd of civilians, an
ticipating the passage of the expedi
tion, hurried for a closer inspection
of the train.
Evidence of the war was not miss
ing from the train itself. Only one
dining car was provided for the 200
travelers. The railroad authorities
explained that all the dining car
were being used to transport
wounded.
Posted in the cars were printed
notices calling upon the public to eat
sparingly and not waste Pood. One
of three notice's gave ten rules, ad
monishing the people to cook pota-
toes with
scraps of
meat.

that when

had thrown bombs with the purpose
of destroying the railroad.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio. Jan. 8.
Quiet prevailed throughout the day
I with members of the Ohio National
j Guard patrolling the principal streets
i of Kast Youngstown where last night
drink-crazed mobs ran riot looting and
! burning property and causing the loss
' of one life and financial loss amount
i ing to $1,500,000 but rumors of fresh
'demonstrations tonight are said in re
newed vigilance on the part of the
militia.
Meetings of strikers were held in the
hills back of the town this afternoon at
which plans of action were said to
have been discussed. It was learned
als that employes of plants in the Ma
honing valley now on strike, will hold
a demonstration here tomorrow. Ac
cording to the plans, the men will as
semble on the outskirts of Host
Youngstown and march past the scene
of last night's rioting to a big hall
where speakers will address the
crowd.
Militia officers acknowledged that
thev had been informed of such plans
but refused to indicate what altitude j
the militia would take in the matter, j
They admitted, however, that the j
fourth regiment, composed of nearly j
1,000 men was being held in reserve at
Kerlin Center, 15 miles west of here for
any possible emergency. I
Although troops began arriving here
about five o'clock this morning, none
was taken to East Youngstown for
patrol duty until nearly noon when
Mayor W. H. Cunningham of that
place requested that militiamen replace
police otficers there in order to por-
mjt
tlie men to gel a much needed
rest. The greater number of - the
troops stayed on the trains which were
backed into the yards of, the Youngs
town Steel and Tube company where
they will lie quartered while here.
Efforts on the part of the stale to
affect a settlement between the
strikers and the Republic Iron and
Steel company and the Youngstown
Sheet and Tube company will prob
ably open here tomorrow. Fred C.
Croxton, state mediator, is expected
to arrive here late tonight and every
effort will be made to settle the dif
ferences. For the first time in the history of
the city saloons were closed in Youngs
town on a Saturday. This action wis
taken by the city authorities in an ef
fort to prevent further disorder. Sa
loons in East Youngstown and Struth
ers w ere also closed hut tho-ie o
! Girard, five miles away were open
and cars running to that town were
crowded.
Today was pay day at the plant of
the Youngstown Sheet and Tube com
pany. Owing to the burning of the
pay office by the rioters last night, the
men were compelled to line up in the
streets to receive their checks.
Reports from Struthers where
threats had been made to blow up the
Yellow Creek dam which would result
in the flooding of the business section
of that place, said it was quiet there.
A detachment of soldiers were sent to
that point today and these aided by

This was the fundamental question
which Judge Hunt told the jury in
his charge must first be settled.
In that event, it was suggested
that the jurors might be deliberating
on the question as to whether the
conspiracy was continuous to the
date of the indictment and were
taking up each phase of the case in
this connection, covering the entire
25 years of the history of the al
leged conspiracy.
Judge Hunt's plan in the event a
verdict was not reached, was to
send the jury to an uptown hotel
and have them resume deliberations
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. It
was said on good authority that the
court in the hope that a verdict
i might be eventually reached, would
keep them out a number of days if
necessary. Having failed to reach a
quick decision, it was pointed out
that the many and complicated

SIX-BIT PIECE

SAX DIEGO, Jan. 8. According to
announcement made today by Presi
dent G. A. Davidson of the Panama
California International Kxposition,
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo is
considering plans for the coining of
silver "six bit" (seventy-five cent)
pieces in commemoration of the expo
sition. It is proposed that the coin be octa
gonal in shape, the same as was the
"1S49 slug" of early California days.
"The plan provides for the pieces to
be 'egal tender as well as to serve as
exposition souvenirs" said President
Davidson. "The request for the issue,
is now before the treasury department
and if granted it will he the first time
that an exposition has adopted a
United Sta'es coin of a value other
than those in daily use. Having a legal
tender value of "six bits" the coin will
be symbolical of California."
Tile issue of this special coin was
first proposed by C D. W. Spencer of
Oakland.

many of which are still intact, will be

If th rings ate similar in their char
