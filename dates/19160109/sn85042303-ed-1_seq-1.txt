PROPOSES MO
NITION PLANT
FOR STATE
BILL INTRODUCED TO ERECT A
PLANT AT OKLAHOMA CITY
FOR MANUFACTURE OF WAR
MUNITIONS.
Washington, Jan. S. Conwessmin
Thompson introduced a hi'l in the
house Friday appropriating $10,t)ti0,
to erect and equal at Oklahoma City
a plant for the manufacture of war
munitions. Regarding the bill, he
said:
"The object of the bill is to lake
the profits mil ol war by having the
government manufact ur 1 war mater
ials. Half the cot of thc materials
'can ho saved by government manu
facture.
"Again, if all profit Is reniT ed from
war the subject can he discu-sed from
a patriotic standpoint and conclusions
reached on a consideration of facta
without being blinded by the specious
argument and the warped judgment
of those who reap profits.
"If there is danger of our coasts
being captured by an invading force
the plant should be located inland,
so there will be no danger of its cap
ture. It ought also to be located
where fuel is cheap and tb-3 supply
abundant.
"Oklahoma produces more gas than
any other slate in the n-ilion. The
Cushing field furnishes a FuppV suf
ficient to provide power for till the
manufacturing plants ir Amcrici, and
it is connected with Oklahoma City
by a pipe line.
"Oklahoma City, therefore, Is the
logical place for this plant."
(PLANTS TURNING OUT 400,000
FEET OF LUMBER A DAY
LABOR CONDITIONS GOOD, AC
CORDING TO ASHTON.
State Labor Commissioner W. G.
Ashton was in the city Friday night
from Oklahoma City. He was here
on his way home from a business
trip to the Choctaw nation. He had
visited the sawmill- plants at irroken
Row, Fort Towson and Hugo.
Mr. Ashton says the people of the
state cannot realize the vastness of
the hardwood industry of the state
without having made a trip to the
southeastern part of the state. The
Choctaw Lumber company has a plant
at liroken flow which has been in
operation about six weeks. The plant
is sawing from sixty to seventy per
cent of oak and is turning out about
10,000 feet of lumber a day. Mills
at four places in that locality give
employment to about 1,"j00 men. La
bor conditions are good. The men
and their
families are properly
housed and they receive from $l.C.j
a day up as high as i and $3 for
skilled labor. The combined capacity
of all the plants in that section is
about 400,000 feet of lumber a day,
and the supply of material is suf
ficient to last for a period of twelve
years.
