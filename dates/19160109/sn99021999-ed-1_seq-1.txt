Secretary Garrison Says Compulsory
Service in the Army is Sure to Come
WASHINGTON. Jan. t -There is no
military post in the United States where
a division of troops can be housed and
cared for. Secretary Garrison told the
houso military committee today, when
hearings were resumed on the army bill.
That condition, however, he said, would
not limit the effectiveness of the con

sen soldiers.
"What we want is an articulated skel
eton that can function," he said, laying
stress on his proposal to build the founda
tion of a definite military policy. "It
makes no difference now whether we
have a little more or less flesh on an
arm or a kg."
The secretary said that unquestionably
any perfect military system must be
based on compulsory service. Many army

LONDON. Jan. 8. The Kusslnn

in the neighborhood of llnsk, which la
threatened with envelopment as a result
