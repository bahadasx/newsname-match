SMALL DELINQUENT
M LIST THIS YEAR
County Treasurer Harry S. Ross has
completed making up the back tax
book on the first payment of the semi
annual taie; and finds that the amount
is only $10,300.01 which is the smallest
percentage that has be-n recorded in a
number of years and reflects great
credit on the condition of things m Co

jority of the taxaers have money
with which to ettle their just debt

.'was delinquent out of the amount due

jpit ear there was collected by Mr
Ross on interested on the county de
posits tbesumof (8,906 07 which is the
largest amount of interest that has ever
been collected in the history of the
county. Mr. Ross is to be congratu-
lated on the excellent record be is mak

while tuberculosis and bronco-pneumonia

While pneumonia was the cause of 7

Of the four deaths from tuberculosis

As a trmperance lectureit is interest
ing to note that there was but one death
from violence, and that was an indus-
accident, and not due to intoiica-

Homicide and suicide are conspicuous
by their absence as a cause of death
during 191.

In SpeaLing of (he new short line
from Yuma to Tucson through Ajo Dr.
F H Ftednrell in the Phoenix Arizona
Gazette had this to sa ;
Yupia and Tucson are constructing
r.iads ilif4nih .thrir cnuniiei to Aj,
which as ma v hi urtn fr.. m ihe map,
will m.iLe a!mot a bee line road from
Yuma to Tucson, a Unit 2s0 miles in
length. Tourist traveling overland in
either direction would save over nine
ty miles by taLintr this hort cut when
completed, leaving out Phoenix entire
ly. What can Phoenix do in the mat
ter? Shebasa chance ripht now to do a
jreat deal.
First, there is ha'dly one tourist in a
hundred traveling over the Borderland
route but want to see the Suit River
valley and the tneTontodnm.and they
will turn toward Phoenix if ihey can
strike a tood all-the-year-around road.

APPOINTED BY
THE CLIFTON
Copper Companies End As
sessment Work; Another
Peace Conference
CLIFTON". Jan. 8. Last Thursday
night about 175 members of the Citi
zens' League met at the grammar
school building to discuss the question
of the members becoming deputy town
marshals. There was a good deal of
speechmaking. in which many subjects
were touched on, and some feeling de
vel'iped, but the meeting finally end.d
harmoniously, and il was deeded to
ask the mayor to appoint as man)
members as desired to become mar
shes. Up ;o date about one hundred mem
bers have taken the oath, and will be
subject to call should occasion arise.
One of the principal reasons for the
formation of the league was to prevent
men from being run out of the district
and it seems to have accomplished its
purposevas this trouble has ceased. So
it will probably be unnecessary for the
town ofin-iiU to i;i ou the volunteers
for help.
' CLIFTON. January 7. Having re
ceived a suggestion from Dr. Dye, the
company representative who hasbien
in the district this week, that the mine
managers were favorably disposed to
calling another peace conference, the
strikers voted yesterday afternoon to
offer such a conference to the mana
gers. Dr. Dye was intrusted with the pro-

It will readil) he seen from the fore
going that Phoenit fears a loss of busi
ness oer the new short cut from Tuc

in getting a going route to Ajo at once
and later will undoubtedly vote bonds
to make "Ajo Short Cut" a standard
road ai.d it it is said Yuma will get her
end of the line doue right away. This line
may eventually be the busy road across
the state, the short tut open alt ear
around is the great demand of business
men and tourists Southeastern Arizona
wants to see a road from Phoenix

Salt River valley to see her cut olf from
the tourists and trust the) will get the

LOS ANGELES, Jan. S Adolfo
Carnllo, Mexican Consul in this city,
issued a statement yesterday afternoon
in which he scouted the idea of the
United States receiving any Mexican
territory as indemnity for alleged dam
ages to Amtncan interests during the
Mexican revolution Furthermore, Mr.
Carrillo added, the present trouble be
ing stirred up in the Senate concerning
the appointment of an American Am
bassador to Mexico is caused more by
perscnal animus than a patriotic and
national feeling.
"I understand that Gov. Hunt of
Arizona is talking about a plan to ob
tain si Kc Hi.l land fioni Mexico to ex
it m! the toundary of his state to thi
gulf of Ca'ifornia. I understand he has
requested the Governor of California to
aid him in influencing Washington to
this endravor." Mr. Cerrillo said. "It
is acainst Mexican law and spirit to
cede one inch of territory. Not even
the President of my republic has a right
to sell or give away his country's land
Only by force of arms can anyone seize
