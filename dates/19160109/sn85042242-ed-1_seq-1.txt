UNSETTLED
Will Throw Open to Fifty-Year
Leases Public Lands Contain­
ing Water Power.
BILL HAD SUPPORT
OF PINCHOT AND OTHERS
Senate Takes Up Question of Ex­
tending Self-Government to
Philippines.
Washington, bail's.—The house to­
day passed the Ferris bill, which
would throw open to 50-year leases
public lands containing more than
three times as much/water power as
now is under development ,in the
United States. It is estimated that in
the eleven states which it is proposed
to enter there are about 19,000,000
undeveloped horse1 power.
The bill is the result or careful
study by water power experts of al»
parties. The 50-year lease feature
had the support of Secretary of the
Interior Franklin K. Lane his pre­
decessor, Walter L. Fisher, and Clif­
ford Pinchot, former chief forester of
the (United Stales.
Mann Support* Measure.
Party lines were cast aside in vot­
ing on the measure today. Minority
Leader Mann was one of its strongest
supporters. Western republicans
fought it, insisting that leasing would
delay development of the sites.
Western senators are planning a hard
fight on the measure in the senate.
Philippine Question.
Debate in the senate began today
on a bill to extend a greater self
government to the Philippine Islands,
continued attacks on the measure by
Senators Sterling and Sherman and a
speech in. its defense by Senator
Williams Senator Sterling declared
that too much self-government al
readv has })ee,n tended tovtl}e Fili
liinjps Vfor"' tlieir ow§ good, and iSena
tor Sherman said the United States
was morally obliged to continue its
supervision of the, islands until the
people arc Unquestionably able to
manage their own affairs. Discussing
a suggestion that Japan might take
the islands if the United States gave
them 'up, Senator Williams declared
"Japan would give them a better gov­
ernment than we can, because the
races understand each other better."
Universal Military Service.
Secretary Garrison told the house
military committee at a hearing to­
day that compulsory service was the
only really adequate basis on which
to construct a military policy com­
patible with democratic govern­
ment.
The secretary made the assertion
merely as an expression of personal
senti-nent and he did not elaborate
on it. His statements were regarded
as significant., however, in view of
the known belief of many army offi­
cers and war department officials
that the continental army proposals
in the'Administration's preparedness
program naturally tend toward ulti­
mate universal service.
'Suffrage Amendment.
The

B. Anthony amendment
providing for woman's suffrage was
reported avorabjy today to the sen­

fication of sex.
Bottineau, N. D., Jan. 8.—Immigra­
tion work of a character and mag­
nitude never before attempted by a
board of county commissioners was
launched in this city today when the
board of Bottineau county let the
contract tor printing 60,000 booklets
descriptive of Bottineau county and
her resources.
The booklet will be profusejy illus­
trated" with halftone vieWs of farm
scenes from ail parts of the county,
as well as photographs depleting the
scenic beauty of the Turtle mountains
and their fishing lakes.
The booklet will contain a great
deal 6f descriptive and statistical
information, all of which is vouched
for over1,the signatures of the several
members of the county board.
An issue of 25,000 copies of a simi­
lar booklet was printed and circulat­
ed in the eastern states last year.
The results of this method of adver­
tising have been so satisfactory to
the board that it was decided to get
out a larger and more comprehensive
edition this year.

HARVARD JGOACH NOW
BMT
Percy D. Haughton Becomes the
President and Part Owner of
Boston Nationals.
Boston, Jan. 8.—Percy D. Haughton,
the famous Harvard football coach,
became president and part owner of
the Boston National league baseball
club. Associated with his as the
head of a syndicate is Arthur C. Wies,
member of a local banking firm. The
new president announced that he
would retain the services of tieorge
T. Stallings. as manager of the club,
and that Stallings would have abso­
lve charge of the playing end of the
organization. Walter E. Hapgood will
continue as business manager,.
The announcement of the sale of
thq club which two years ago won the
world's championship after a sensa­
tional season, was a surprise in sport­
ing circles. The Braves had not been
on the market and until a few days
ago President E. Gafltney and Robert
F. Davis of New York, (he owners,
had fully expected to retain control
during the coming season, according
to a statement, issued by Mr. Gafffcy.
Unofficially the prico is said to be
nearly half a milliqn dollars. The
club was purchased three years ago
by Mr. Gaffey for *187,000. The new
Braves' field, at which the last
world's series games were played,
was not included in t'lie sale. A lease,
the same length as held by Gaffney,
was given the new owners. It will
be for thirty-three years.
While Mr. Haughton's statement
made no direct reference to his sever­
ing relations with Harvard as coach,
it announced that he would "devote
his time to the club and its interest
in the future."

New York, Jan. 8.—^Approximately
20,000 college men are in readiness
to take the field, should the United
States become involved in war, de­
clared Dr. John Grier 'Hibben, presi­
dent of Princeton university, in an
address here today before the Re­
publican club.
These young men, he said, are in a
state, of preparedness because of the
military training they have received
in college. He said the presumption
that America could raise a volunteer
army of a million men between sun­
rise and sunset is sheer nonsense and
that war would be simply butchering
of our young men, who are untrained
for military service.

ENCOURAGED BY
RECENT NOTES
Officials at Washington Gratified
Over Recent German Note
on Submarines.
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION
OF PROBLEM IS REACHED
Will Investigate Arming of Ital­
ian Liner Now in Port of
New York.
Washington, Jan. 8.—Encouraged
by th^ conciliatory attitude shown
by .Germany and Austria in recent
diplomatic exchanges with the United
States, officials are considering re­
questing a definite and comprehen­
sive statement pledging not only Ger­
many, but all of her allies, to re­
spect. in the conduct of their sea war­
fare, th,c guarantees as to the safety
of American life, for which this gov*:
eminent has contended throughout
the entire submarine controversy.
iPresident Wlilson is being urged by
his, close advisers to ask the Ger­
manic allies for definite assurance^
that no unarmed ships with Ameri­
cans aboard shall be destroyed until
passengers have reached a place of
safety.
Like German iNote.
Officials are particularly gratified
over Germany's latest note on the
destruction of the American ship,
William P. iFrye, made public today,
because of its acceptance of the prin­
ciple that the mere placing of non
combatants in lifeboats before a
prize is destroyed is not a sufficient
guaranty of safety.
This concession, coupled with the
offer of Germany to pay indemnity
for the Lusitania victims and Ambas
sador von Bernstorff's assurances re
garding the conduct of German sub
marines in the Mediterranean, ha-vi
contributed greatly to the feeling
that a satisfactory solution of the en­
tire-problem might be near at hand
Italian Liner Artned.
b'aron tErich Swiedinek, charge of
the Austrian-Hungarian embassy, to­
day informally called to the atten­
tion of Secretary Lansing the pres­
ence of two mounted three-inch guns
on the Italian steamship, Giuseppe
Verdi, when she arrived in New York
Thursday.
(While official information upon the
subject was lacking, it was under­
stood that the charge has made in­
quiries as to what action the United
States, as a neutral, considered tak­
ing in the matter.
Lansing to Investigate.
(Secretary Lansing wa3 said to have
assured Baron Swiedinek that the
vessel would not be allowed to leave
the American waters before the ques­
tion involved had been disposed of.
Officials in a position to be familiar
with the attitude of the United States
expressed the belief that the ship
would not depart until the guns had
been removed.
Collector Malone's report regard­
ing the presence of rifles on (he Ver­
di states thai, the Ship was navigated
by a civilian crew and did not, as
was unofficially reported, carry gun­
ners of the Royal Italian navy.
Protests to England.
The United States has sent to Am­
bassador Page at London for presen­
tation to the British foreign office note
vigorously protesting against the Brit­
ish authorities interfering with and
'censoring mails from the United
States to neutral European countries.
Tho note is understood to have al­
ready been delivered to the British
foreign office.
Numerous complaints have been re­
ceived from American business men
and others that their mails destined
to neutral points in European coun­
tries have 'been opened by the British.
Americans Make Appeal.
The American Association of Com­
merce and Trade, embracing the Am
ereiecan business colony of 'Berlin,
today sent a wireless appeal to Sec­
retary of State Lansing and leading
congressmen at Washington, praying
for action to assist Americans rep­
resenting ^American firms here whose
business is paralyzed by British in­
terference with commerce.

All Sides.
ONE DINER PROVIDED
FOR 200 DELEGATES
The Hague, Jan. S.-- Five weeks af­
ter its departure from Mew York, the
Ford peace expedition reached The
IHague today. The members, of the
party planned to begin immediately
the work of spreading the peace prop­
aganda.
The trip from Copenhagen in a spe­
cial train through Germany,# touching
at Lubeck, Hamburg and Bremen,
was ifilled with impressive sugges­
tions of war. At the importaht sta­
tions, the American peace advocates
passed train loads of soldiers bound
for the front and fted Ci'oss nurses
in hospital coaches.
Trip Made in Dark.
The progress though Germany
was watched by silent crowds, ex­
cept at one place, whe'e a German
lieutenant lifted hi^^tynet and ex­
pressed* success: to ^F-pfroJect. The
entire trip over German territory was
made after (lark.

Arriving at the German port of
Warneme in a ferryboat from Den­
mark, the peace delegates were mei
by a special' train. The train was
locked and started quickly for the
trip across northwestern Germany.
After awhile the military iguards
on the train relaxed the rule and per­
mitted the travelers to look out of
the windows. Groups of Red Cross
nurses were seen on the station
platforms, soldiers were leaning out
ot' the windows of incoming and out­
going trains, the familiar gray-coated
German officers pacing back and
forth, and frequently a crowd of citi­
zens hastening for a closer inspection
of the train.
Only One Dining Car.
Only one dining car was provided
for the 200 travelers. The railroad
authorities explained that all the din­
ing cars were being used to transport
the wounded. Posted in the cars
were printed notices calling on the
public to eal sparingly and not waste
food.
Long before daylight lite train
crossed the border and was speeding
toward The Hague.
Within a week, the officials of the
peace mission expect to select the
members of the peace board that are
to remain at The Hague.
The other members of the expedi­
tion will start on their return to
the United States o? January 1".

Saloons Closed to Drink Crazed
Mobs Big Demonstration of
Strikers Today.
EFFORTS AT SETLEMENT
TO BE STARTED AT ONCE
Eighty-Seven Rioters Arrested
Strikers Threaten to Slow Up
Big Dam.
Youngstown, O., Jan. 8.—Quiet pre
vailed throughout the day, wilh mem
bers of the Ohio National Guard pa
troling the principal streets of East
Youngstown, where drink crazed
mobs ran wild, looting property, and
causing the loss of one life and fin
anclal loss estimated at $1,15)00,0*00.
Rumors of fresh outbreaks tohight
resulted in renewed vigilance on the
part of the militia, but several hours
after dark no demonstrations had
occurred.
Meetings of the men who formed
last night's mob were held in the
hills back of the town this noon, at
which plans of action were said to
have been discussed.
Demonstration Tomorrow.
It was learned also that, employes
of plants in the Mahoning* valley, now
on strike, will hold a demonstration
here tomorrow. According to the
plans, the men will assemble on the
outskirts of 'East Youngstown and
march past the scene of last night's
rioting, and on to a big hall, where
speakers will address thfi ,c,rowd.
(Militia officers acknowledge that
they had been aware of such plans,
but refused to indicate what attitude
the militia would take in the matter,
They admitted, however, that the
Fourth regiment, composed of nearly
1,000
men, was being held in reserve
at Berlin Centre, 15 miles west oi
here, for any possible emergency.
AHhough troops began arriving
here about 5 o'clock this .morning
none were taken to East Youngstown
for patrol duty until nearly noon,
when Mayor Cunningham of that
place requested that militiamen re­
place police officers there, in order
to permit the men a much needed
rest.
Try to Settle.
Efforts on the part of the state to
effect a settlement between the strik­
ers and the Republic Iron and Steel
company and the Youngstown Sheet
and Tube company will probably open
here tomorrow.
For the first time in the history ot
the city, saloons were closed in
Youngstown on a Saturday, this ac
tion being taken by the city author­
ities in an effort to prevent further
disorder. Saloons in East Youngs­
town and Struthers were also closed.
Reports from Struthers, where
threats have been made to blow up
the Yellow Creek dam, which would
result in the flooding of the business
.section of that place, said it was
quint there.
Eighty-five persons have heen ar­
rested in East. Youngstown as a re­
sult of the rioling. All have been
transferred to Ihe county jail in
Youngstown and will be held pend
ing the outcome of their trials.
One Man Killed.
Despite rumors that at least four
persons had been killed last night
search by the police today showed
that only one man, George Gett, aged
i' !, who was shot as he was smash­
ing a blass in a building, was killed.
Twenty-two persons are in hospitals,
suffering from injuries, one of whom
is in a critical condition. According
to the police, at least 100 other per­
sons suffered minor injuries.
Dies of Wounds.
The death toll of last night's riot­
ing was brought to two tonight, when
Robert Davis, a railroad brakeman,
died from wounds. Davis was struck
by a stray bullet.
TWO MEN KILLED IN
OREGON LANDSLIDE
Baker, Ore., Jan. 8.—Caught in a
snowslide, which swept a clear swath
down the side of Bull Run mountain,
20 miles from here, today, Albert Veis,
aged 55, a miner living in his cabin
on the mountain side, was crushed to
death while a companion, whose name
was not given in the report here, es­
caped with a broken arm. Searchers
are hunting for other possible victims.
IS IMPROVING.
Peter Silvernagle of Napoleon, who
was removed to the St. Alexius hos­
pital as the result of injuries receiv­
ed when he was run over by a grain
tank, is resting comfortably following
the amputation of one of his limbs.
Mr. Silvernagle was leading a team ot
horses hitched to a grain tank when
the animals became frightened,
charged forward, knocking him down,
the heavy grtiin tank passing over his
limb. It is thought that his injuries
will not prove fatal.

Carl Ftertsch. local contractor and
builder, has returned from a business
trip to Medina and Jamestown.

Washington, Jan. 8.—Delegates to
the second Pan-American Scientific
congress, which ended a two weeks
session here today, were guests of
Secretary Lansing tonight at a ban
ciuet featured by addresses emphasiz­
ing the growing tendency of closer
relations among the American repub
lies.
Secretary Lansing, Ambassador Ed
uardo Suarez of Chile, president of
the congress Judge George Gray of
Deleware, chairman of the United
States delegation, were among the
speakers.
Mr. Lansing expressed the gratifl
cation of the United States for what
the congress had accomplished, and
Ambassador Suarez, responding for
the organization, proposed a toast to
"the president of the United States
as a symbol of the country that has
entertained us so fraternally."
In delivering a farewell to the do
parting delegates, Judge Gray urged
that the American republics which
"need no formal treaty to impel us to
unity of thought and action," should
not neglcct in their friendly relations
with each other to take steps for mili­
tary preparedness.
Monday, as the guests of the United
States government, the foreign dele
gates will leave for a tour north as
far as Boston, which will end at New
York January 1(1.

High Priced Animals Being Pur
chased Which Are Found to
Be Unsound.
iDr. W. F. Crewe, state veterinarian,
issues the'following warning:
Parties purchasing stalliqns should
take precautions to determine that
animals are free- from trBdsmtetialHe
disease and unsoundness.
The North Dakota stallion law pro­
vider that stallions cannot be legally
used for public service if affected
with certain transmissable diseases
and unsoundness, which are specified
in the law accordingly, an animal
that is refused a license on account
of unsoundness has little more value
than a work horse.
It would appear that every precau­
tion should be taken to determine
that an animal is either licensed in
this state or eligible to license, be­
fore concluding the purchase.
The law requires that stallions im­
ported into this state must be ac­
companied by a Sartificate of sound­
ness, but this is not tho best of as­
surance that the animal can be li­
censed in this state. Purchasers
might better rely on the advice of
their local veterinarian, if they have
one that is competent.
Recently a stallion was shipped in­
to this state and sold for $2,000. The
stallion was accompanied by a cer­
tificate of soundness. The purchas­
ers took him to their local veterinari­
an to have him examined for life in­
surance. This veterinarian found the
animal with four pronounced side
bones on both front feet This con­
dition renders the animal ineligible
to license and he cannot be legally
stood for public service.
iNow, if this examination had been
made before the purchase was con­
cluded the parties would have avoid­
ed a probable lawsuit and the animal
would not have been sold within this
state.
WOMEN WOUNDED BY
San Francisco, Jan. 8.—Mrs. Emily
Bomberg was probably fatally shot
and Miss Rose Rea was wounded,
when they refused to deliver a cash
box to two negro robbers here today.
The box contained the funds of a sal­
ary loan concern of which Mrs. Bom­
berg is manager. The negroes es­
caped after firing five shots at the
women.
SATURN CHANGES COLOR.
Flagstaff, Ariz., Jan. 8.—Recent ob­
servations of Saturn at the Lowell
observatory show a remarkable
change, it was announced today, in
the color and brightness of the planet
ball, which is now of a pinkish brown
tint and strikingly darker than the
rings.
APPEALS FOR SONS.
Denver, Col., Jan. 8.—Mrs. O. S.
Steuerle, appealed to the state auth­
orities today to aid in securing im­
munity for her two sons from serving
with Australian forces in the Euro­
pean war. Mrs. Steuerle states that
her sons, who have been living in
Australia for several years, are Amer­
