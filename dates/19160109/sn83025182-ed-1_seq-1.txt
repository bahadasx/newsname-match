garded certain Inheritance taxes are
probable and taxation of war muni
tions a remote possibility, according to
the democratic steering committee
members.
Modification of present war taxes la
also predicted. While sentiment In
congress for taxation of war munitions
or profits of strob manufactures is ad
mittedly growing, the revenue experts
doubt if they are feasible. The prin
cipal objection Is their uncertainty If
the war should suddenly cease, this
source of revenue would be cut off in
stanter, leaving a hole In Imperatively
needed revenues.
The treasury department and ways

and the principal European countries
in times of peace. This information
covers every conceivable plan and art

Thp first revenue bill to be presented

which have arisen during the war.
The formal protest against British

only the first step of the state de

to permit cotton to go to Germany.
America's difficulties with the cen

NEW TOJIK. Jan. 8.—The costliest
array of counsel in tho country idled
about the corridors of the federal
building here today, or lounged in
Justice Hunt's court room at an aggre
gate expense of $675 an hour, while
twelve Jurors, men'of moderate means,
deliberated on the guilt or innocence
of eleven directors of the New Haven
railroad.
Court attaches figured the Jurors'
luncheon recess of one hour cost each
of the defendants in docket fees

been paid retaining fees before en

leave his dangerous post on Vesu

crater repeatedly to note every de
velopment, despite the warnings of
his companions. They fear he may
be caught beneath an unexpected lava
movement, or suffocated by an out
burst of gases at any moment.
The people of the neighboring vil
lages are not yet seriously alarmed.
Many peasant dwellers on the moun
tain sides, however, are ereoung

"The present activity of Vesuvius
is only a feature ot most unusual
selmistic disturbances which have
caused a reawakening of volcanoes in
all parts of the world," said Prof.
Malladra. "We are watching the
situation closely, but the symptoms
thus far noted give no reason for
alarm. There is no indication what
ever that a serious disaster is im
pending."
at the conclusion occupied more time
listening to a repetition of Justice
Hunt's instructions. Estimates of the
dally attendance fees varied, but they
were believed to average about $500
for each of the eleven defendants on
trial. George MiacCullough Miller, 82,
also indicted, did not go to trial,
though he is charged with the others
with conspiracy to violate the Sherman
anti-trust law.
R. V. Lindabury, counsel for William
Rockefeller, was said to be receiving
(1,000 to 91,200 a day for attending
court in addition to his retainer. He
has been in court sixty-three days,
Other counsel costs were large in pro

defendants.

I have put the defendants to an expense
of approximately $5,500 and should
they wait until Monday to report, an
other $5,500 will have been added to
the aggregate expense of the trial to
the defendants.
Not only is the Jurors' deliberate
ness costing a huge sum for every
hour of counsel's time, but, the time
spent in court by each defendant was
estimated at a huge sum.
The wealth of the eleven men on
trial is estimated at $300,000,000, the
greatest in any trial in American
criminal history. Stenographers' fees
alone were $35,000 for transcribing
more than 2.000,000 words of evidence.
Though a verdict was hoped for to
night. preparations were made for
holding Sunday court and should the
jurors fall to agree by 11:30 tonight,
they will be locked up and given a
chance to deliver a decision tomorrow.
