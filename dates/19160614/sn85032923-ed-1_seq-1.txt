ST. LOUIS, June 12. Prccon-
vention discussion among Democrats
centered largely today on moves and
suggestions to defeat plans for the
rc-nomination of Marshall. The move
to defeat the vice-president took a
well defined form when Henry Mor-g-nthau.

rhan Marshall should Ifir ta'inHT." and
suggested Secretary of War Baker.
Before leaving Washington Secretary
Baker announced that he favored
Marshall and said he expected to
stop mention of his own r-amc upon
his arrival in St. Louis tomorrow.
National Chairman McCoombs said
there had been "no hitch in the plan
to rc-namc the present Dcmocratu.
ticket." He declared talk o: upsetting
the plan to re-name Marshall was
"silly and absurd." Bryan docs not
expect to precipitate a fight on the
Democratic platform, according to a
close friend, who added that Bryan
might not even go before the reso
lutions committee. Bryan is expected
tomorrow.
Senator Stone, who will be chair
man of the resolutions committee, is
sued a statement this afternoon in
which he characterized the nomina
tion of Hughes by the Republicans as
in every way bad and vicious. He

political experiment for a great party,
hard pressed, to invade the Supreme
court. President Gompcrs and other
labor leaders brought 14 labor planks
to Chicago which they desire to 'have
incorporated in the platform.
Suffragists On Watch.
ST. LOUIS. June 12. Suffragists
have high hopes that the Democratic
convention will incorporate an equal
rights plank in .some form in their
national platform. Suffragists have
noted with interest the attention the
Democrats have paid to suffrage 'dec
larations in the Republicaa platform,
and have declared the Democrats can
no longer afford to ignore the issue.
The anti-suffragists arc ready to
make a determined stand against any
favorable mention of equal rights in

CLAIMS LOCKS

JOHN DUKE IS CHARGED
WITH MISDEMEANOR;
M'OMIE ALLEGES HE
DAMAGED PROPERTY.
(From Tuesday's Daily.)
John Duke, local hotclman, was ar
rested yesterday on a warrant charg
ing him witn breaking the locks on
one of the gates along the main irri
gation canal of the Hassayampa Al
falfa Farms Company. Duke appear
ed before Justice McLane and was re
leased on his own recognizance. The
warrant was sworn to Saturday by
O. E. McOmie, general manager ot
the company.
"We have tried to get along and
co-operate with Mr. Duke ever since
we started our irrigation project,"
said MteOmie last night, "but he seems
bound to interfere and his actions
have been so aggravating that we
could not but take steps to have the
matter settled in court. Duke claims
that he has certain water rights, and
we admit this, but we do not admit
that he any right to 'break the locks
on our irrigation ditch gates, nor to
replace them with locks of his own,
as he did on one occasion last month.
"We have had many things to con
tend with sine? we started to develop
our irrigation project and we have
not been assisted bv Duke to any
great extent. I. myself, have tried to
settle the question of his rights with
Duke and have been unable to ever
net him to agree on any reasonable
plan. The company has nothing
against him and is willing that he
should have all the water he needs
but we do pot intend to stand for
Duke breaking the locks on our gates,
taking all the water he wants before
we know it and interfering with out
service. If the water is allowed to
run through broken gates it inter
feres with the needs of consumers
farther alon the line of the canal
and upsets our entire system.

(From Tuesday's Daily.)
Stephen McDougall, an employe of
the M'ountain States Telephone and
Telegraph Company, was probably
fatally injured yesterday afternoon at
about 2:30 o'clock when the safety
belt he was wearing snapped in two
and he was thrown to the ground
from the top of a pole, a distance of
20 feet, alighting on his head. His
skull was fractured. When taken to
Mercy hospital a few minutes later,
an operation was performed, but his
condition last night was regarded as
honclcss.
The misfortune occurred in the al
ley to the rear of Goldwatcr's store,
where this Kncman with others was
placing cross-arms on a pole for tne
new plant which the company is in
stalling in the city. McDougall and
others of a trained crew arc recent
arrivals from El Paso, and were de
tailed for this especial work, owing
to their experience and capability.
The unfortunate victim of this sad
accident is unmarried and only 2S
vcars of age. Only a short time be
fore he ascended the pole, he made
an inspection of the safety apparatus.

THREE RAIDERS KILLED
Secret Service Agents Say Carranza Officers Promised To
Allow Bandits to Conduct Border Warfare Unmolested,
Officials Fear Attack on Pershing's Expedition.
By Associated Tress.
WASHINGTON', June 12. .
With 1,500 additional regular
troops ordered to the Mexican
border tonight and reports of the
rapid spread of anti-American
feeling continuing to pour in from
consuls all over Northern Mexico,
administration officials arc mak
ing no attempt to disguise their
uneasiness. It is officially admit
ted that their growing alarm is
over what the agitation may pro
due? and the possibility of an at
tack on General Pershing's expe
dition. A part of the increasing
apprehension is due to renewed
raids in the Laredo region. Sev
eral reports dealing with the situ
ation have been received.
Officials declined to give tic
tails but gave the impression of
having reason to believe that
there was a serious purpose be
hind the bandit raid at Coleman
ranch. Three raiders were killed
and three captured. One report
added that the Mexicans attempt
ed to burn the railroad bridge but
failed. The new force was sent
to the border. Secretary Baker
said to fill gaps in the guard. It
will be composed of ten com
panies of coast artillery and a bat
talion of engineers. The artillery

G. O. P. Will Win In State
And Nation, Says Anderson
Teddy Will Come Out For the Jurist, Claims Prescottonian
Back From Convention, Says Leader Was Only Re
publican Roosevelt Did Not Oppose,
(From Tuesday's Daily.)
Confident of the success of the Re
publican party in the coming national
election, by a large majority, LeRoy
Anderson returned home yesterday
from the Chicago convention.
Mr. Anderson's visit was not alone
political, for he has been spending
several weeks past touring the Mid
dle Western States in his automobile
and renewing his boyhood friendships
in Kentucky and Illinois.
"It is my confident opinion." said
Mr. Anderson in discussing the po
litical situation, "that Hughes will
win by an enormous majority, and
that Roosevelt will soon announce
himself for Hughes. There is no
doubt that he will refuse the Progres
sive nomination and that the Progres
sive national committee will endorse
Hughes. The only hope expressed by
the Democrats in the East for Wil
son's election, was a divided Repub

Secretary Baker said he had no
present intention of calling addi
tional national guardsmen. It
was officially reported that a pa
trol of three cavalrymen was fired
on Saturday night near Hachita
and Private Saunders. 12th cav
alry, slightly wounded. A mes
sage from Captain Burrage. com
manding the battleship Nebraska,
at Vera Cruz, said there was con
siderable unrest in that region,
due apparently to the currency
situation.
The State department, through
Special Agent Rodgcrs at Mexico
City, has called the attention of
the de facto government to anti
American outbreaks, which, for
nearly two weeks have been
spreading steadily. Because of
economic conditions in Mexico,
officials feel that thc-issibilityr
of serious trouble is enhanced.
Secretary Lansing is still at work
on a reply to the Carranza note
which will probably not be de
livered for a week or ten days.

IS SILENT
By Associated Press.
OYSTER BAY, June 12 James R.
Garfield and Dean William Draper
Lewis visited Colonel Roosevelt to
day and "had a full and frank discus
sion" with the colonel relative to what
he intends to say in regard to the po
litical situation and the "time he
should say it." Neither of the visit-
lican party. Now that this hope has
gone it will be a landslide for Hughes.
That Roosevelt will be for Hughes,
is without question, in my opinion. In
fact, Hughes was the only one of the
Republican aspirants for the nomina
tion who seemed to suit Roosevelt.
Ilis opposition to all the others was
outspoken and open, but he never
would say that he would oppose
Hughes. His only delay was in try
ing to find out just where the justice
stood on tne question of Americanism.
Now that Hughes has spoken his
views, in no uncertain terms, upon
this and other questions, in UU tele
gram of acceptance, and will more
fully discuss them in his forthcoming
letter of acceptance, I feel sure that
they will meet the Colonel's views
and he will come out whole-heartedly
and with all his strength for the Rc
nublicau nominee. Tnis is the feel
