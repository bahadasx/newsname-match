BAKER NOT A CANDIDATE
Secretary of War Arrives at St. Louis
.With President's Own Draft of
Democratic Platform.
St. Louis, June 14. Notwithstanding
the sweltering heat that prevailed In
the convention hall this afternoon the
delegates and spectators joined in 14
minutes of cheering when the name of
President Wilson was first mentioned
in the speech of Permanent Chairman
MeGlyn of. New York.
St. Louis, Juno 14. The arrival last
night of Secretary of War Newton D.
Baker, President Wilson's personal
representative, bearing "the presi
dent's own" draft of the platform and
news that he desired the renomiuation
of Vice-President Marshall, firmly es
tablished the harmony program for the
democratic national convention, which
opent today.
A program upon both the presidenti
al and vice-presidential nominations
and the platform, as well, has apparent
ly been agreed upon by the leaders.
Vice-presidential booms, around
which most of the pre-convention
fights have centered, wilted away last
night under influence of the personal
message from the White House that
the president desired Mr. Marshall
again as his running mate. Secretary
Itaker also effectually disposed or the
vice-presidential boom in his own be
half which had attained prominence
in the belief in some quarters that
Mr. Marshall lacked genuine adminis
tration support.
"The president's own" draft of the
platform a single copy said to have
been typewritten by himself will be
delivered by Mr. Uaker to Senator
Stone of Missouri, ehairman-to-bo of
the resolutions committee.
Although Mr. Paker declined last
night to disclose the president's plat
form views, it was learned the plat
form will" dwell 'principally "on peace,
preparedness for peace, and prosper
ity." Despite agitation by some dem
ocratic leaders, President Wilson, it
is said, disapproved insertion of a
plank criticizing the nomination of a
supreme court justice for president,
or favoring a constitutional amend
ment prohibiting justices from seek
ing other, public federal offices. The
president desires adoption of a j Kit
form so progressive that it will ap
peal to and attract members cf the
progressive party, but without an
open, direct Invitation to the pro
gressives to swing their strength to
the democratic ticket, it was learned.
As to female suffrage, it was under
stood the platform will suggest that
the women continue their efforts for
the ballot in the respective states,
the primary authority for political
qualifications. The principal planks,
it was authoritatively stated, will deal
with the administration's trials and
achievements In handling Internation
al and Mexican affairs, its rapid and
deliberate steps toward "preparedness
for peaco" and the record of economic
and industrial legislation contributing
to general prosperity.

Prentiss 11. Kent, son or the late As
sistant Judge C. 1!. Kent of Dorset and
one of the most genuinely respected
and generally liked young men in Pen
nington, has become a benedict. He
Mtas married on June 3 at Fulton N.
Y.,;he bride being Miss Gertrude

"iy took place. Mr. Kent Is in the
business with headquarters
aC - b. His business has necessi
tated ii. " -'sits to Pennington
and lie has n ide a host of friends
who will wish twin every happiness.
These numerous well-wishing friends
are not acquainted with Mrs. Kent, but
if they were they would probably in
form her that she is a mighty lucky
young woman. The Amsterdam Even
ing Reformer of June 8 contained the
following:
"Fultonville, June 3. This morning
the marriage of Miss Gertrude Hom
ing and Prentiss Howard Kent, of Put
land, VI, took place at the home of
tho bride on Prospect street. Owing
to the recent death of Mrs. Horning,
the wedding was a very simple one,
only the members of the family and
a lew intimate friends being present.
The ceremony was performed at 11
o'clock by the Rev. G. H. Dow, pastor
of the Methodist Episcopal church. The
bride wore a dark blue traveling gown
"with hat to match and carried a bou
guet of white carnations. She was
given away by her father, George
Horning. After a brief trip through
the Bcrkshires the young couple will
reside at No. 82 Grove street,, Rutland,
Vt. The bride is one of the most at
tractive members of the younger set
and is very popular. Slio is a gradu
ate from the Fultonville High school,
in the class of 1911, and since has
been a successful teacher. She will be
greatly missed from her home circle.
Mr. Kent is general agent for the Con
necticut General Life Insurance com
pany and has won many friends In
Fultonville by his genial and courteous
manner. The good wishes of all go
with the bride and bridegroom. Those
present at the ceremony were: George
Horning, Miss Mathilda Homing, Hen
ry and Jewell Horning, Dr. anil Mrs.
Walter Reynolds, Mr. and Mrs. Mal
colm S. Fearey of Albany, Miss Mar

IN MEMORIAN
Miss Caroline B. Downs.
"And so beside the Silent Sea,
I wait the muffled oar,
No harm from Him can come to me
On ocean or on shore.
I know not where His islands lift,
Their fronded palms in air,
I only know 1 cannot drift
Peyond His love and care."
(Whittier.)
When my Panner came, 1 read the
words which told me, that one of the
best friends I ever had, and one of the
most loyal daughters of the "Village on
the Hill" had passed to the Life Eter
nal. And then as I sat and thought, how
the long span of years faded away, and
once more I was a child again in my
home on the old hill and I thought of
the rainy Saturdays when the small
hoys of the vicinity assembled and af
ter deciding that out door play was im
possible, we would always go to the
old "State Arms" house, to ask "Miss
Caddie," (as we knew her) if we might
go up in the famous old Pall-Room and
play. And we were never refused, both
she and that gracious and beautiful
woman, her mother, always doing all
that lay in their power to help us en
joy the hours. And later in the alter-
iu,oii we were sure to hear a pleasant
voice at the foot of the stairs calling,
"Now boys come down, mother has
something for you in the kitchen." And
that meant a plate of cookies such as
tnly Mrs. Downs could make.
I remember as the years Hew by how
one by one the family grew less, first
tho mother, then the sisters and the
father till at last our old friend and
her brother were aVl that remained.
Eight years ago he went and she was
the last of the family. As 1 have gone
each succeeding year to my old home,
one of my first pleasures has been a
call on "Miss Caddie," my mother's
friend and mine. And the hearty wel
come has always been there, for I have
remained one of her "boys" and 1
thank Cod for tho Influence of that
quiet self-sacrificing life which radi
ated sunshine and good-will on all who
knew her. May her memory prove a
benediction to nil her friends, especial
ly to her n'ce who has cared for her
so tenderly in these last days, even as
she cared for all her dear ones In sick
ness or In health during her whole life.
"There hand in hand firm linked at
las'.
And heart to heart enfolded all,
Will smile upon the troubled past,
And wonder why we wept at all."

CZERE10W11Z
Capital of Bukowina Still Held By
Austrians
BITTER FIGHTING NEAR TARNOPOL
Teutons Putting Up Strenuous Defence
in Order to Prevent the Capture of
Lemberg.
I'etrograd, June 13. The reports
of the actual occupation of CzernowlU,
capital of Pukowina, by the Russians,
were premature, but alter the re
cent defeat of the Austrian Col. Gen.
Pflanzer's army and the successful Rus
sian operations in the immediate vicin
ity of Czernowitz, official news of the
fall of the city is momentarily ex
pected here. The Zale Szczyky point
of support officially announced as cap
tured was one of the most important
positions on the Dniester line of forti
licaliom:. The two other most important sec
tions of the front extending from the
Pripet River to Rumania are the reg
ions south of Lutsk and north of Tar
nopol. From the reports of the preci
pitate Austrian retreat from the for
mer region it is Inferred here that the
Austrians were compelled to relinquish
their most important position on the
Ikwa front tho Torgovitsa fortifica
tion, which is located at the junction
of the Ikwa and Styr Rivers. The oc
cupied position is of the greatest
strategic value. Here the same fate
overtook the Austrians as at Mlynoff,
on the Ikwa east of Torgovitsa. Find
ing themselves the target tor an in
tense artillery bombardment from
three sides the garrison fled in disor
der.
In the section around Tarnopol
there has been the most furious and
sustained fighting of all. Upon the
outcome of this engagement tho safe
ty of Lemberg depends and the Aus
trians are straining their utmost to
prevent further Russian advances.
Taking the Initiative In the region of
Gliadki and Vorobievka ' they are
launching a continuous series of at
tacks and making considerable gains,
but only to have the newly ;carrled posi
Hons wrested from them by the Rus
sians In counter-attacks.
SURVIVES LINCOLN CONVENTION
Col. Sawyer of Hyde Park Cast Vote
for Collamer-Edmunds in 1880-84.
The session of the republican na
tional convention calls to mind the
ict that Col. E. P.. Sawyer of Hyde
Park Is one of the very lew delegates
now living to the convention new m
Chicago In lS'in which nominated
Abraham Lincoln. During the past
year another delegate to that cenven-
tion, ex-Gov. John W. Stewart of Mid-
dlobury, has died.
At that convention Vermont's 10
votes on the first ballot were cast for
Senator Jacob Collanier of this state,
In tho conventions of 1S80 and 1SS4
Senator George r. Edmunds of Ver
mont was a presidential candidate
The republican correspondence de
scribing at that time the details of the
convention of 1884 said that the
speech cf Gov. John D. Long made at
midnight placing Senator Edmunds in
nomination was the greatest effort of
Mr. Long's life and made the speaker
a man of national reputation.
The speeches of Mr. Long and
George William Curtis in support of
Edmunds were called the strongest
made in behalf of any candidate.
It is worthy of note that this man
who was placed in nomination 3(5 and
again 32 years ago preserves his, men
tal vigor unimpaired and had been
able within the past few days to com
merit favorably upon the courso pur
sued by Justice Hughes.

DEFENCES OF HILL
314 CAPTUREO
Crown Prince's Troops Win French
Trenches Northwest of Verdun
TEUTON ARTILLERY ACTIVE
Big Guns Have Been Advanced for a
Systematic Pounding of
French Lines.
London, June 14. Renewing their
terrific attacks on the French lines
northeast of Verdun, the Crown
Prince's troops have captured ad
vanced trenches on the eastern slope
of Hill oL'l, to the west of Thiaumont
Farm, on which the defenders' Hue
pivots.
This loss by a night ussault is admit
ted by the French War Office, which
says, however, that the Germans were
beaten off at all other points. j
Following the lull after the capture
of Fort de Vaux, the Germans brought
up fresh effectives, reformed tht-ir
lines, and advanced their artillery to
positions from which they have now
begun a methodical pounding of the
main French defenses, especially the
powerful batteries at Tavannes and
Fort de Souville.
The French, on their part, have not
been idle. Thiaumont Farm bristles
with well-placed machine guns, and the
German masses, toiling up the slopo
which leads to the French positions,
are driven back again and again, while
their reserves are kept copiously show
ered by shells from French batteries
at the rear and on the other side of the
rive.
It is estimated that the Germans
have used up 30,000 infantry in assaults
on the trenches west of Fort de Vaux
and at Thiaumont.
West of the Meuse there were no im
portant actions last night, but the bom
bardment was heavy in the region of
Chattoncourt.
CHURCH UNION IN WESTON
Closing Two Churhes Out of
Three
Improves Community.
Here Is the case: Weston Is a rnoun
tain town of some 7oO population, lor
many years it had three churches.
Raptist. Congregational and Metho
dist. Each one of the churches was
small in numbers and poor In re
sources, atfording its pnstor little
more than starvation wages. The Bap
tists sent their minister to Peaseville
in tho adjoining town of Andover, for
an afternoon service and he secured
there a small addition to his stipend
The Methodist sent their pastor tn
the afternoon to the adjacent town of
Landgrove, where he was paid $200
sometimes. The ( ongrcgatlonalists
because they could not find a man will
ing to live on so small a salary, em
ployed a woman to occupy its pulpit
and visit Its scnttered families. Each
one of the three denominations sup
plemented the gifts of the people of
Weston from funds raised for home
missionary purposes from tho state
at large.
That is the condition as It was
three churches living at a poor dying
rate, thankful to hold their own, and
keep their doors from being closed,
and hoping against hope for better
days 1o follow. What is the condition
as it is today? Two churches lire
closed. The town has one pastor, the
Rev. Richard A. Burn of the Metho
dist church, who devotes his whole
energies to that one parish acting as
principal of the high school during
the school year, ministering to a large
and ever growing congregation upon
the Sabbath, and receiving a good sup
port for his labors, the missionary so
cieties being free to spend their money
elsewhere.
Weston has just such a man as the
News suggests, and he docs succeed
in making the church moro or less of
a community center, and there is
growing up a "Rigger. Potter, Busier
Weston". We leave it to the News
If this isn't right, anil better than
the prolongation of the agony of three
churches In a field largo enough for
but one.
And what has been done In this on
Vermont town might be done In many
another, letting the stronger church
whichever that-might be, hold the
ground and fill It with Intensive cul
tivatiou that would make the desert

AMERICANISM IS
HOT BLUSTER.
SAYS IlSOfl
Nation Should Not Carry a Chip on
Its Shoulder.
TALKS TO WEST POINT MEN
President Tells Graduates Only Those
Who Put America First Should
Be Tolerated.
West Point, June 13. Making his
first address since the presidential cam
paign began, President Wilson today
discussed preparedness, militarism,
Americanism, the causes of the war in
Europe, peace, the Monroe doctrine,
divided allegiance, and the Ideals of
America. He declared it is the imper
ative duty of the United States to bo pre
pared, adding that "mankind is going
to know that when America speaks it
means what it says."
The President said the United States
should not be a blustering nation, a
nation with a "chip on its shoulder,
but a calm nation which will withhold
its hand as long as possible and strike
only for vic tory."
The President's address ran through
almost the entire list of subjects dis
cussed by former Justice Hughes in his
telegram accepting the Republican
nomination, and he declared the Unit
ed States Is "ready to join other na
tions to see that the kind of justice it
believes in is given."
Shaking his finger emphatically the
President told the graduates of Clio
military academy and a large audience
that "nobody who does not put Ameri
ca first can be tolerated."' He added,
however, that true Americans should
tet a good example.
The President declared the present
war did not come by accident but that
it had to come. The United States
wants nothing from Europe, he said,
and there is nothing It wants which it
must get by war.
The word "Americanism'' was used
today by the President for the first
time in recent addresses. He warned
the graduates against militarism.
The speech was interrupted fre
quently by applause and he was cheer
ed as he concluded.
NEW RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE
Great Trial of Strength with
Austria
Yet to Come.
The similarity between Gen Brusl
loff's advance in the past week and
the Russian drive against the Aus
trians at the beginning of the war is
generally commented on at I'etrograd.
One difference, however, is pointed out
that Gen. Bruslloff's Initial blow has
been considerably more effective and
that the retreat of the Austrians be
fore it more precipitate than during
the initial events of 1314.
The net result of the week's opera
tions has surpassed the expectations
of the most ardent believers In the
southern U ader's ability. With up
ward of 72,00i) prisoners (the latest
official statements now place the num
ber of prisoners at about 108.000) and
immense booty and with the com
munications between the Austrian ar
mies around Czartorysky and Rafa
loka. and those in the neighborhood
of Czernowitz seriously threatened,
thorn is great rejoicing among the mill
tary and civilian population.
Tho military authorities regard the
piercing oi the .Austrian line aiong
the Stripa as perhaps of greater im
portance than breaking through at
Lutsk. Assuming that tho Austrians,
even with tho aid of the Germans, are
nimble to push the Russians back
here, it will mean that the Austrians
themselves must fall back along the
whole line northward and quickly, in
order to maintain a formidable front.
It is pointed out that nn orderly re
treat with such gigantic, armies Is an
extremely difficult task, Once they
are on the move anil with the Rus
sians pounding at their rear, it is con
tended the great drive of HU4 through
Poland and Galicla is likely to be re
peated. At the same time the military
critics warn the peoplo that the great.
trial of strength between Gen Brusilol'C
and Gen von Linsingen Is yet to
come and that it remains to be seen
If the latter is able really to strike
back effectively. They add that if
the Russians succeed In holding what
they have already gained, the Aus
trian plans for tho summer campaign
have doubtless been effectively
smashed.
Gen Bruslloff's promptness In seiz
ing advantages and following up the
eneniv forces Is regarded us the high
est evidence of the completeness of
the Russian preparation. "The pursuit
has been kept up day after day relent
lessly with no signs or diminution.
Details of the fighting are still lack
ing, except for meager accounts fil
tering in from wounded olllcers who
have arrived ut Kiev and Odessa.
Scenes of excitement In tho trenches
and villages where the reserves were
stationed when the word of the pro
posed ndvancc came Saturday, the 3d.
are told of by a captain of a Siberian
regiment. Where possible religious
services were held.
"Next day," he continued, "after a
tremendous bombardment, the first,
second and even the third lines of
Austrian trenches were easily taken.
Our losses were light. Put in the
strongest positions in the rear the
enemy made a desperate stand . with
machine guns, bombs and previously
prepared mines. Here we suffered
more heavily. It was necessary ' to
storm the positions. This our men
did with splendid courage and deter
mination. "As soon as wo came within reach
with the bayonet the Austrians gave
up, whole companies throwing down
their arms. They appeared to have
no heart for bayonet work.
"On we went, leaving heaps of dead
behind. Sometimes we had to take
defensive positions against counter
attacks. My corps withstood eight in
succession, repulsing them and then
charging again. Through the breaches
in their front our cavalry poured, in
some instances riding into the de
moralized rear, slashing, spearing and
yelling like demons as they rode.
"Entire regiments of Austrians were
cut off and surrendered. There was a
continuous stream of prisoners day
and night toward the Russian rear.
Among the prisoners were many German-speaking
officers and 1000 Ger
man soldiers who had been incorpo
rated in the Austrian regiments."

of our school for seven years, during
which the school has prospered and I
feel, has been very successful, has de

is voluntary on his part and 1 feel sure
that I express the sentiment, not only
of the school authorities, but of the
community, in saying that his action Is
regretted and that he leaves us as
sured of the respect, goodwill and af
fection of all.
j We are also sorry to loose from our
sijhool Miss Kentfleld and Miss Plumer
both of whom have had a very succes

obliged to decline re election, even at

MOOSE CHIEF WILL . HELP
Prominent Progressive Leaders Among
Callers at Former Justice's Head
Quarters Yesterday. ,
New York, June 13. Charles E.
Hughes today defined his attitude to
ward German-American support as one
of "undiluted Americanism." i:i the
first statement issued since bis accept
ance of the republican nomination for
president, he said:
"1 Htated my position very clear
ly in my telegram to the conven
tion. My attitude is one of un
diluted Americanism and anybody
that supports me is supporting an
out and out American and an out
and out American policy abso
lutely nothing else."
The nominee s day, a busy one, was
devoted almost exclusively to receiv
ing callers. His vicltors were moro
numerous than yesterday. There wero
so many of them at one time that a
line was formed and they filed past to
shake hands and chat for a moment
instead of waiting to be received
done. Several progressive leaders and
republican supporters of Col Roosevelt
were among them.
Everett Colby of New Jeiooy, who
placed John M. Parker in nomination
for the vice presidency at the pro
gressive convention and Theodoro
Douglass Robinson, nephew of Col.
Roosevelt and a former progressive
leader in New York, called during Mr.
Hughes' absence at luncheon. They
left word that they would return In a
day or so to deliver in person their
pledges of support. Oscar S. Straus

later to congratulate the nominee and
reiterate his pledge. ',
