Chicago, June 10.?Charles 1
Evans Hughes, former Governor
of New York, and Associate .
Justice of the supreme Court,
was nominated today for the
presidency by the Republican
National Convention.
Charles Warren Fairbanks of
Indiana, elected Vice President '
with Theodore Roosevelt , in ,
1904, again was chosen for second
place.

first ballot of the day?the third
ballot of the convention for the
presidency?were made by acclamation
unanimously.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts
presented by Colonel Roosevelt
as a compromise candidate,
received seven votes. Colonel
Roosevelt himself received 18 1-2
scattered over 12 States.
The nomination ballot showed
this count:
Hughes 949 1-2; Roosevelt
18 12; Lodge 7; Du Pont b;
Weeks 3; LaFollette 3; absent 1.
Total 987.
Although Frank H. Hitchcock
let it be known that the Hughes
men wanted Burton for second
place, Ohio withdrew Burton's
name, leaving the field to Mr.
Fairbanks and former Spnnfnr
Burkett of Nebraska.
The ballot for Vice President
showed this count:
Fairbanks 863; Burkett 108;
Borah 8; Burton 1; Johnson 1;
absent, scattering and not voting
6. Total 987.
Mr. Hughes will be notified
officially at a date to be fixed
later by a committee headed by

the convention.
Mr. Fairbanks will be notified
by a committee headed by Senator

of harmony from all the
leaders and amnncr the Helecratec
The delegations which on the
final ballot had cast votes for
others than Mr. Hughes made
statements declaring their loyalty
to the nominees.
"Six months ago," said chairman
Hilles of the National
Committee, "I said a nominee
would be born in the convention,
and he was."
"I am very much pleased, of
course," said Mr. Hitchcock.
"It means a reunited Republican
party and victory in November."
The canny Scotchman is, of
course, a synonym for thrift.
Ian MacDougal, about to leave
on a journey, proved no exception
to the rule.
In his parting injunctions to
his wife he said:
"Noo, Janet, dinna forget to
mak wee Sandy tak' off his
glasses when he's no' look in'
through them."

enter a second, although a great
number of his loyal friends believe
that a majority of the
Democrats of the district would
vote for him in a second primary.
He thought the contest would
be spirited and hardly to the
best interests of the party.
He feels that the best sentiment
of the district Democracy i
prefers that there be no further ;
contest and individual ambition
should be subservient to the
public good.
He says he feels profoundly
grateful for the loyal support he
received. "The very excellent

* Uncle John and the "High-bed
1 Disease" of Corn
0
"Talk about the bell weevil,
man," said Uncle John, as he
.* dropped in on the Editor, "I've
? discovered a corn disease that
t beats the boll weevil all holler.
' They's quite a lot of it, too, an'
I see some farmers' whole crops
have got it bad.
"What is it?some sort of bug
or worm?" we asked the old
man.
"I'll tell vou the symptoms,"
^ he replied, *'an' let you figer it
out fer yourself what's the matter.
First trouble you notice is
s that the corn, somehow or other,
1 has managed to git itself set way
e up on a ridge, with what looks
to me like ditches between the
' ridges. Then the little corn
v takes on a sort o' hungry, weaz

L like a yearlin' with the ticks on
' him, turns valler, an' ends its
unhappy career by makin' a
y nubbin, an' sometimes just a
shuck, with not a grain o' corn
' in it."
"This is a new one and seems
pretty serious. Does it seem to
be catching?can one plant or
field catch it from another?" we
' inquired.
"No, it ain't ketchin', so fer's I
y know," said Uncle John, "though
I do find whole neigoborhoods
' that's got it. It seems to be
specially bad where folks use a

"Well, we give it up; what's

s what's the remedy?" we asked.
^ "The disease," said Uncle
John, stroking his whiskers and
~ assuming a knowing air, "is
what I call high bed disease. It

Morning Train Will Not Be Dis
continued
The editor of the Journal is ii
receipt ol the following lette:
from Mr. E. C. Bagwell, genera
manager of the Seaboard, in regard
to the morning train which
is run from Pageland to Chora w
on each first Monday and eacl
day court is in session at the.
county seat:
Dear Sir:?I have read witl:
much interest and appreciation
vour editorial in the Pagelane
Journal of May 3rd with regard
to the morning train which we
run from Pageland during court
weeK at uiiestertield and on firsi
Mondays. Even though this
train is run with a direct loss, it
is our purpose to carry out the
terms of the arrangement with
the corporation commission
without any complaint on our
part.
It is our desire to give the patrons
of the Chesterfield & Lancaster
the very best service that
we can, even in view of the
light earnings, hoping by a liberal
policy to aid in the development
of the territory contributary
to our track.
Of course if the Corporation
Commission should of its own
accord desire to have an investigation
as to the necessity for
the continuance of this train and
if they should in their findings
determine that the train w as not
being used and it should meet
with the general approval of the
people between Chesterfield and
Pageland to discontinue the
train, we would of course abide
by their findings. 1 low ever, as
stated above the C. <S: L. expects
ito continue to run this train as
loiigiTs there are any pass'eifgers"
at all using it, or until such time
as the Corporation Commission
of South Carolina shall advise
us that we can run it at our discretion.
I am verv glad indeed to note
the sentiment of the Pageland
people as expressed in your editorial
and I hope that the citizens
of Pageland and vicinity
have realized that it is the desire
and intent of the present management
of the C. & L. to give,
such service as is necessary to
the development of the section
served by it.
