Doner of Beautiful Electric Flag Will
Attend Unveiling Ceremonies
at Court House This Evening.
TELLS OF CHICAGO CONVENTION
Says Hughes Will Poll Larger Vote
Than Any Olther Man in the
United States.
Governor Leslie M. Shaw arrived in
Denison Monda^and will be in attend
ance at the exercises this evening of
the upveiling of/the electric flag which
lie presented to the city, and has been
"prevailed upon to deliver an address
at the exercises. The many friends of
the governor are delighted that he is
in the city to take part in the exercisj
es and doubtless there will be a large
crowd in attendance to hear him
speak. The exercises will be held at
the south entrance of the court house
at 8:80 o'clock. A fine program, con
sisting of music and speech making,
has been arranged and at the close of
the program the flag will be illumi
nated.
Governor Shaw arrived in Denison
Monday and is stopping at the home
of Ir. and Mrs. E. Gulick, where his
wife has been visiting for the past
twp weeks. Last night he was in Ma
nilla and opened the republican cam
paign in Crawford county, delivering
an address on preparedness before a
big crowd. For the past two weok3
he has been in Chicago in attendance
at the republican national convention,
and maitnained headquarters at the
Cogress hotel. It will be of interest'
to liis many friends in Crawford conn
ty to know that he took a prominon!
part Ip the convention and was called
upon to confer with the national lead
ers of the party on numerous occas
ions. He iB taking an active interest
in the copilng. campaign and will de
liver many speeches throughout the
United States in the interests of
Hughes and Fairbanks. Mr. Shaw is
a firm believer in preparedness and is
said tp be the Instigator of the pro
pat&dnesB propaganda which has been
sweeping through the country.
Governor. Shaw, when asked fof a
statement. concerning the resist of
thf Chicago (convention, replied:
"I »tn well pleased. Justice Hughes
will poll a larger vote than any other
man in the United States and he will
mdke. a most excellent president.
"Few people know Charles E
Hughes. He is a unique character. A
position on the supreme bench is most
dignified and must have been congen
fat to a man of his temperament, but
Charles E. Hughes never says no to
duty.' He let it be known that he did
not desire the nomination, but fur
ther than that lie would not go. He
would have responded to the call with
equal promptness and perhaps with
less tears had he known that it meant
defeat or even assassination. This
comes from' his deep, abiding and un
swerving christian character. He would
go to the stake with equal promptness
as to the presidential chair if duty as
he understands it so demanded.
•"The only criticism anyone has ever
offered of Justice Hughes is of a po
litical character. It is said that he is
not sufficiently appreciative of the
work of his friends. But he never
asks favors tior grants them. Duty js
the one pole star of his private and
public life. Gen. Grant said of him
self, 'I have never sought a position
of honor^ or preferrment, and have
never declined one." This is the high
est standard of the American citizen
and no man whom I have personally
known so completely measures to that
standard as does Charles E. Hughes.
"Vice Presfdent Fairbanks is equal
ly well known. He Is a man of unim
peachable character and a very lov
able man.
"The campaign will bo most inter
esting and I hope free from acrimony.
For a number of years we have had
personal politics as distinguished from
party politics and abuse and misrep
resentation have been freely Indulged.
This campaign bids fair to be free of
these •"objectionable features."
A landscape gardener from Des
Moines was ill Denison the latter part
of the week and planted the shrubbery
ahr trees around the federal building
according to the plans sent out by the
Unite4 States government. It required
•'three days to complete the work and
-it1 will" not be long until the grounds
Will present as pleasing an appearance
f'aBilhe court house square, which was
beautified by trees and shrubs two
years ago.

TO PAVE FIFTEEN
MORE BLOCKS
At a Meeting of the.City Council on
Tuesday Evening Dccided to
Pave Some More Blocks
TO PAVE TO THE I. C. DEPOT
Remons'rance Pcltltion Up Was Tabled
—Paving Progressing Rapidly
Hard to Get Gravel and Sand
So well pleased are the residents of
Denison with the new pavement that
they have prevailed upon the city
council to lay a number of additional
blocks this summer. The city fatli
ers held a meeting last evening, at
which time it was decided to pave
from tho intersection of Trernont
street down Court avenue to tho Illi'
nois Central tracks, also from tho in
tersection of Church and Sweet street
south to the Northwestern freight de
pot past the Carnegie library and tho
Presbyterian and Baptist churches
An additional two blocks will be or
dered in from the intersection or Ri'.ii
road avenue and Locust street past
the Doud kill to the Northwestern
tracks and on State street from Locust
to Main street.
This additional pavement will go
through tho regular legal process and
notices will ho published in the local
papers next w,eek for the same. The
council took the matter up with Mr.
M. L. Flinn, of Sioux City, yesterday
and asked if lie would do the addition
al paving at the same price which he
contracted for before. Mr. Flynn
stated that inasmuch as it would be
necessary to receive bids on this ad
ditional work, lie would not care to
make known what his hid would •,be
but wo understand that, the price will
be as low or lower than the paving
which is now under way.
There has been considerable coui
plaint over the fact that the pavement
only went to one depot and the coun
cil relt that it might be well to have
the streets paved to both depots this
year rather than to put it off until an
other year. Court avenue will be
paved from the court house on down
past the 1 C. freight dopot up to -their
tracks. This will make a fine stretch
of pavement and one that will be used
as much as any of the other streets
originally ordered in.
We are told that there is a move
ment on foot to pave east Broadway
from the J. P. Jones corner to the P.
W. Harding corner. Property owners
in this block have petitioned the coun
cil for this improvement and it is to
be disposed of at a meeting to be held
next Tuesday evening.
A remonstrance petition dealing
with tho grade at the J. P. Jones cor
ner was brought before the council
last evening, but no action was taken.
There has been considerable trouble
over the .grade at the intersection ot
Locust and Broadway in front of the
•'ones residence and after thoroughly
canvassing the matter the council de
cided to raise the grade a few inches.
Property owners residing east of this
corner petitioned the council to leave
the grade as it was in the first place,
but there is little likelihood that they
will bo able to prevail upon the city
dads to do so.
Paving is progressing rapidly, most
of the work in North Denison now be
ing completed. The contractors are
having considerable difficulty in secur
ing sand and gravel and this is de
laying the work to some extent. Mr.
Flinn is purchasing tills material at
Lako View and has made several trips
up there to see if shipments could not
be made more regularly. It seems that
the concern selling the gravel and
sand Is so rushed that they are unable
to supply the demand, notwithstand
ing the fact that they have only re
cently installod additional equipment
to handlo the work. There is no hot
ter material available in the state for
concrete work than at Lake View and
they are supplying sand and gravel
Tor most of the paving contractors in
western Iowa.
The Ward & Weighton company,
who have the contract for laying the
new water main from the deep well
to the standpipe and also for the con
struction of the concrete reservoir
near the power plant, have their men
on tho ground and work will be start
ed at ohce.
The board of supervisors met Tues
day as a board of canvassers to can
vasp the returns of the primaries held
last week. Already a few mistakes
have been found, but It is not expect
ed that the results will differ mucli
from the vote as printed in the last
issue of the Review.

Play- Deloit Here Sunday.
The Denison ball team was defeated
by Carroll at that place Sunday after
noon by a score of 4 to 3, but from all
reports the game was handed to Car
roll by the umpire. The Denison boys
were game, however, and have very lit
tle to Bay in rogatrd to the treatment
they recoived at Carroll. The score
would have been tied,, so we are, told,
had it not been for'"the fact that tho
umpire called a Carroll man safe at
the home plate wlion in fact ho was
twenty feet from the platter when
Denison's catcher had the ball.
Pottash and Wahl, of Omaha, made
up the battery for Denison at this
game, and it was most effective from
beginning to end. Pottash struck out
six men. Bitterberg and Klick were
the battery for Carroll and they struck
out five of Denison's players. Carroll
scored the first run in the first nnins
and followed up with a score in the
fifth, sixth and seventh innings. Den
ison did not tallv until the sixth in
ning, when they chalked up two runs
and managed to get away with anoth
er in the ninth.
It was a fast game and Denison fans
say that the local team showed bet
ter team work titan in any previous
game. Sunday the local team wil'
play the Deloit club at the ball park
in West Denison.

SUDDEN DEATH
OF YOUNG MAN
Decfth of Albert B. Langenbuch Oc
curred on Sunday Morning at
Hor^s on East Chestnut.
CAME HERE FROM ENGLAND
Only Been in Denison a Short Time
But Leaven Many Friends to
Grieve Over His Death.
The unexpected death of Albert
Langenbuch, which occurred last Sun
day morning at 10 o'clock at the fam
ily home on Fast Chestnut street
caused profound sorrow to tho many
friends of the family in this city. For
several months the young man had
been in poor health and the fact that
he brooded over business matters is
believed to have undermined his health
and brought on his untimely death.
Mrs. Langenbuch, together with her
son, Albert, and daughter, Augusta,
were residents of Manchester, Eng
land, where the son was engaged in
business. Since the death of the fath
er, some four years ago, Albert had
been conducting the business which
his father built, up, which was a
bureau or translation, where all kinds
of legal and business papers written
in foreign languages were translated.
When the war broke out between Ger
many and England conditions became
unbearable for the family in Flngland
on account of their German national!
ty. The fact that their neighbors and
closest friends ignored them and that
tiie business was dwindling to nothing
forced theni to leave for America
They arrived in this country last June
and came directly to Denison to visit
at. the home of their cousin, Mr. A. C.
Balle. For a time they visited with
Mrs. Langetibuch's brothers, Messrs.
Carl and William Lorenzen. .it West
Point, Neb., but returned to Denison
recently to make their home, having
rented the residence of Mrs. Augusta
Hamley on East Chestnut street. Last
December Albert secured a position
with the Marshall Field company in
Chicago",Tut returned tb'Donison About
ten days ago to accept a position as
clerk in tho Balle-Brodersen store,
where his sister, Augusta, was work
ing. Not being familiar with the cus
toms in this country it worried, him
considerably not to be able to secure
employment such as ho was used to
in his native country. During his
short residence in Denison he made
maiy triends and everyone with whom
he came in contact enjoyed hearing
liim tell or the conditions in England
since the war started. He had an ex
ceptional education, being able to
converse in five languages and had a
working knowledge of two additional
tongues. When he left Manchester he
placed his business in the hands of
competent employees who were con
ducting it during his absence.
The deceased was an only son and
was born at Manchester, England, on
the 2d day of September, 1894. He
leaves to mourn his death his mother
and one sister.
Private funeral was held Monday
afternoon at 4 o'clock at the German
Methodist church. Rev. E. Witter of
ficiating, after which interment was
made In Oakland cemetery. Those In
attendance- at the funeral from a dis
tance were Mr. and Mrs. Carl Loren
zen and Mr. and Mrs. William Loren
zen, of West Point, Neb.
The special committee appointed by
the Commercial club to ma^k the
Spirit Lake air lino from Denison to
Odeholt. has commenced work and
•within a few days the route- will be
nicely marked from Denison to Spirit
Lake. The Commercial club at Spen
cer will mark the route from Odebolt
to the lake, in addition to the air line
the committee is co-operating with
the Charter Oak Commercial club and
will mark the Sioux City road from
this place to the Oak.
Mr. U. G. Johnson, who resides at
Redfield, S. D„ was renominated at
tho primaries held last weok for state
representative by the largest maiority
ever received by a candidate in the
district in which he resides. Mr.
Johnson has made a great, record in
tho South Dakota hduso of represent
atives and the fine vote tendered him
at the primaries last week is a fitting
recognition of his services. Soveral
of the daily papers in the state are
mentioning Mr. Johnson's name for
speaker of tho house next winter. The
many friends of Mr. Johnson here in
Denison will bo glad to learn of his
success.
ARRESTED FOR SELLING 800ZE
Buck Grove Man Up Before Justice
Rollins Charged with Boottleg.
ging—Turned Loose.
A Mr. Leffler was arresetd at Buck
Grove on Monday morning, charged
with disposing of intoxicating liquors.
An information was filed before Jus
tice.VV. C. Rollins, of this place, ask
ing that the party be bound over to
the grand jury for the action of that
body. An investigation failed to dis
close facts sufficient to hold the party
and he was discharged, after the hear
ing by the court.
It seems that a young man by the
name of Hulsebus Was found glorious
ly intoxicated on Sunday and he
charged the responsibility up to a Mr.
Leffler, but the evidence failed to sus
tain the charge and hence the action
of the court acquitting him. Mr. Leff
ler is in the employ of William Lentz,
a farmer near Buck Grove, and was
shown to be a young man.. of good
character.
The Denison local news page has
been transferred to page,seven this
week in order to accommodate the
double page advertisement of the Geo
Menagh" company, which occupies
pages four and five. This popular store
is advertising a big .Tune Clean Sweep
sale and is using this large space to
make known the many wonderful bar
gains which it has to offer. James
Menagh, who manages the store
writes all of the advertisements and
thoroughly believes in newspaper ad
vertising. We urge Review readers
to read the announcement over care
fully.
DEMONSTRATION
A BIG SUCCESS
Demonstration Held at City Hall by
Municipal Light Company Proves
to be a Big Success.
A NUMBER OF STOVES SOLD
Large Number of Interested Citizens
Attend antf Take-Interest in Af
fair—Lunch by Mrs. Silletto
The demonstration of electric stoves
and various kinds of electrical .do
vices held at the city hall by the mu
nicipal light company last Wednesday.
Thursday and Friday afternoons
proved to be a great success, hun
dreds of people being in attendance.
Electric stoves -of the latest pattern
proved to be the main attraction at
the demonstration and the fact that ex
perts from the concerns manufactur
ing the stoves were present to ex
•plain them in every detail made it all
the more interesting. Seven differ
ent models of the Hughes electric
stoves were on display, ranging in
price from $95 to $10. One of the
large models with four burners and an
oven was in operation during the dem
onstration and Mrs. John Silletto pre
sided over this. Delicious baking pow
der biscuits and rolls were baked in
the oven and guests were served with
hot coffee and meat. On Wednesday
and Thursday roast beef donated by
tho Economy meat market was served1,
and Friday afternoon steak. donated
by the Denison meat market was broil
ed in the oven and served to guests.
On Wednesday 'afternoon
jW.
Hover and W. D. Luney ttemonstTati-iar
ed the stoves to scores of''ladles. On
Thursday Mr. H. Fi. Jones, of the
Hughes company, was present and ex
plained the stoves to all Interested
parties, while Friday afternoon Mr.
Latta. of the Western Electric com
pany, distributors of the stoves in this
territory, was present. The electric
stove is practically a new thing and
was only introduced in Denison last
fall. The fact that several stoves
have been in operation In Denison for
the past few months and have proven
to bo successful attracted many peo
ple to the demonstration who were
anxious to have them explained.
The demonstration was very suc
cessful and the light department re
ports the sale of four stoves, they oe
ing to O. A. Patterson, D. E. Voss, G^o.
Sprecher and Jacob Sims. With the
present low rate made by the city
council for current for heating pur
poses it is expected that many stoves
will bo installed in Denison this sum
mer. The stove'is absolutely safe and
has none of the bad features of-the
gasoline or kerosene stoves which
sooner or later cause considerable
trouble. They are said to bo as eco
nomical to operate as a kitchen range
without all of the smoke and 'ashes
and they eliminate tho danger of fire.

MUSIC RECITAL
Entertainment on Wednesday Eve
ning at College Chapel Proves
One of Best Ever Given.
MISS RAINE WINS LAURELS
Value of Work is Seen in the Number
of Young People Who Have Gone
Out and Made Good.
The music recital at the college
chapel on Wednesday night of last
week was one of the features of com
mencement week. In fact, it was a
very important feature. Miss Lillie
Raine, the head or the music depart
ment of the college, has reason to be
proud of her work in her department.
Since she hasx been connected with
the institution It has been her pleas
ure to see graduated from the insti
tution under her direction a number
of young people who have made good.
The entertainment on .Wednesday
niglit was up to the standard if not
one of the best entertainments of its
kind given by the college for a long
time. Each one of the graduates
rendered his part in an exceedingly
creditable manner and such as to elic-'
it the praise of the audience. It would,
perhaps be impossible to give atten
tion to the individual performances of
the several students who took part in
the entertainment, but it is said the
entertainment as a whole was one of
the best that has been given for many
years at the college.
The value of the work of the institu
tion is seen in the number of young
people who have. received their train-'
ing at the college and have gone out
into their various fields of work well
equipped for life's duties. When we
reflect that every year a number of
young men and young women in, this
locality are graduated from this in
stitution who* perhaps might not havei
availed themselves of an education
had they been compelled to have gone
to other schools away from home, it
becomes a matter of great delight to
the patriotic citizens of Denison'•who
were responsible for the instiution
and who have for so many years stood
behind it to insureVitj^'cuftpfete. We'""
do not believe that our citizens fully,
appreciate the importance
ot
I.
No. 24

the work:",
of tike college and the influence it has
exercised and is exercising, not only
here, but elsewhere and wherever the
graduates of this* institution may find
their homes after graduating.
The college quartet, composed of
Hubert VanNess, Garl Krauth, Jen
nings Newcom and Jesse Riggleman,
took part In the entertainment on
Wednesday night and added to the In
terest of the occasion. The quartet
is frequently called upon and never
fails to please those who hear them.
TRAIN AND AUTOMOBILE COLLIDE
Car Driven by George Gla's Badly
Wrecked on C. & N. W. Crossing
at Sand Pit Last Evening.
An automobile driven by Mr. Geo.
Glass was badly wrecked last evening
about 8 o'clock at the Chicago &
Northwestern railroad crossing near
the sand pit south of town, when it
was struck by a freight train which
was backing up.
Mr. Glass only recently purchased
the machine from Pautsch Brothers'
garage and was not thoroughly famil
with the hahdling of it He,., to
gether with Moritz Jurgensen, started
across the crossing near the sand pit
just as a freight train started backing
up. Mr. Glass it'is said, lost control
of the machine and realizing that he
would be unable to avoid the train,
jumped from the machine, as did his
companion, and fortunately neither of
them was injured. The machine was
badly wrecked, however, having the
hood and radiator smashed in.
Miss Harriet Gebert returned last
Wednesday from Indianola, where ihe
has been attending Simpson college.
Miss Luella Cole, who has been
teaching in the public schools at Des
Moines, returned the first of the week
and will spend the summer here vis
iting her parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. H.
Cole. Miss Bertha Logsdon, of Ames,
accompanied her to Denison for a visit.
A number of the younger set are
enjoying an outing at Lake View this
week the guests of Mrs. M. E. Jones
at her cottage. The party consists .of
Misses Eunice and Dorothy 'Jones,
Hertha Lehfeldt, Alys Swanson, Mabel
Pett, Dorothy Tucker and Hubert Van
