HAS ACCOMPLISHED WHILE PRESIDENT
i
Gentlemen of the Convention:
The democratic party in thl con-
ventlon assembled, meets to perform'
a duty, not to itself, but to the nation
'Proud of the pan it has placed in
,h(. nations. IJaat the party of J.
Mn and ot Jackson is gathered here I
lo dedicate itaelf anew to the preser-i
vmUi.ii .i a tree, a united, a sovereign
republic.
We are proud of the battles we have
fought in the past under the emblem
of a great political party, but there is
a truth that we desire to alatHMH above
-il that we may say or do in this con
vention. We have entered this hall as dem
ocrats, we shall deliberate and act
here ..s Americans.
We w ho gather in this hall, stand
lor the Americanism of the Fathera,
who laid the foundations of this na-
tion so strong and deep that no storm!
has ever rocked them, no upheaval 1
ever moved them. We stand for the
Americanism which under the magic
spell of citizenship and the mystic in
fluence of the Stars and .Stripes con
verts men of every country into men
of one country, and tl.at country our
country; men of every flag into men
of one flag, and that flag our flag.
Our ideals and our Aspiration.-,.
When a hundred years look back
UDon this gathering or today, when we j
who now guard the nrk of American
covenant have become nothing but a
memory and a name, the principles
lor which we declare in this conven-;
tion, the issues for which we fight i
in this campangn win live in the lives'
of generations of Americans yet un
born I
If in the great crisis that now con-!
Ironta the nation, the American people
falter, if they forget that they are
guardians of the most sacred trust
111111 a people ever neiu, lueii apostasy
will be visited upon the descendants
Ot their children's children.
Out of the flaming fire of revolu. j
tion, out of a struggle in which they
risked their lives, their fortunes and
their sacred honor, the Fathers of the
Republic brought a nation which they (
dedicated to Uberty and to human ' I
progress. I
For the nations consecrated, true!
men in every generation have labored
and struggled, suffered and died, that ! i
it might flourish and endure.
We who stand today on the fertile j
soil of America, who live under the I
smiling skies of a free and fruitful ,

F..r the America of today and for
the America of tomorrow, for the
civilization of the present and for the
civilization of the future, we must:
hold to the course that has made our
nation great, we must steer by the
stars that guided our ship of state
. through the vicissitudes of a century.
For myself l have confidence enough
in my country, faith enough in my"
countrymen to believe that the people
of America will rise to their responsi-
billties with a single mind and a sin-,
gle voice.
Disregarding the divisions that
make one man a Tory and another a
Whig, one man a republican and an-.
: other a Democrat, Americans will cast
j aside the tinsel of party labels and the'
mummery of party emblems.

determine
I American must again
whether it shall have a national sou:,
whether it shall stand forth as a
mighty and undivided force, whether
the United State for which Washing
' ton fought and for which Lincoln died
shall hold its place among the nations.
For two years the world has been
afire; the civilization that we know
bas been torn by the mightiest strug
. ' "
""" O
Sparks from Eu-
rope conflagration have blazed in
our own skies, echoes of her stri'.e
have sounded at our very doors. That
fire still burns, that struggle still con
tinues, but thus far the United States
has held the flame at bay; thus fur
it has saved its people from partici
pation in the conflict.
What the people of the United
Stales must determine through their
suffrage is whether the course the
country has pursued through this cru
cial period is to be continued; wheth
er the principles that have been as
aerted as our nalioual policy shall
ne endorsed or withdrawn.
This is tlie paramount issue. No
lesser issue must cloud it. no unrelat
ed problems must cunruse it.
In the submission ot this issue to
the electorate we, of this convention,
hold these truths to be elf-evldent to
every student of Americas hist-.rv
to every friend of America's institu
tions First That the T'nited States Is
constrained by the traditions of its
Past, b) the logic of Its present and
in its relations with the European bel
j ligerents must continue the policy
I that It has hursued srnce the begin
: ning of the war, the policy of strict
i neutrality in relation to every warring
j nation, the policy v hich Thotnaa Jef
ferson defined as "rendering to all th
I services and courtes.es of friendship
land praying for the re-eatahllhment
I ot peace and right!"
Thir l. That save where the liber
ties, the territory or the substantial
I lights of the United States are Invad
ed and assaulted, it is the duty of
1 this nation to avoid war by every hon
I orable means.
Fourth: That it is the duty of the
United States government to maintain
the dignity and the nonor of the Am
erican nation aud in every situate. ii
lo uemand and secare from every
belligerent the recognition of the neu
tral rights of its citizen.
Fifth: That because the preaidenl
of the United States ha aaaerted
these principles ana pursued these
policies the American people muit
support him with ardor and with en
thusiasm in order that these princi
ples and policies may be known to ail
the world, not as the opinion of an
individual but as the doctrine and
laith of a loyal and united nation,
i lii- PoHey of Neutrality Is An Amer
ican As the American I-lag.
In emphasis of these self-evident
propositions we assert that the Policy
of neutrality is a truly American a
the American flag.
For 200 years neutrality was a the
ory'; America made it a fact.
The first president of the United
Slate was the first man to pronounce
neurality, a rule of international con
duct In April, 1793. Washington declared
the doctrine; and witnln a month,
John Jay, chief justice of the supremo
court of the United States, is an epoch-making
decision from the bench,
whose realization would ensure uni
versal and perpetual peace wrote the
principle into the law of this land.
The Declaration of Independence had
friends;" the constitution recognized
it; but the first president of the
United States by interpretation gave
it vitality and power.
And so neutrality is American in its
years later Prime Minister
Canning in the British parliament
pointed to this American policy of
neutrality as a model for the world;
and eighty years later, after approv
al by various statutes and agreements
it was written almost word for word
in the treaty wherewith we settled
our differences with England over vi
clations of neutrality throughout the
civil war.
And so neutrality is American in its
consummation.
And today in this hall, so that all
the world may hear, we proclaim that
this American policy of neutrality is
the policy which the present adminis
tration pursues with patriotic zeal
and religious devotion; while Europe's
skies blaze red from fires of war, Eu
rope's soil turns red from blood of
men. Europe's eyes see red from tear
ot mourning women and from sobs of
starving children.
The men who say this policy is not
American appeal to passion and to
prejudice and Ignore the facts of his
tory. Neutrality is America contribution
to the laws of the world Sir Henry
Maine says so
Charles Francis Ad-
ims say so. Henry Clay says so. Dan-
ie( Webster says so and upon theevi-
uence oi tnese witnesses we reat our
Americanism against the sputterlngs
of pepper-pot politicians or the fab
rication of those with whom a false
issue is a good issue until its falsity is
shown. It maliciousness exposed.
Hiouiry Kt-KULs itsolf.
For enforcing this policy of neu
trality George Washington was hoot
ed by a howling moh of 10,000 war
fanatics who threatened to pull him
from the presidential chair and start
