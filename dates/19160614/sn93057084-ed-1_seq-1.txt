an A few weeks ago the Bisuiark
Daily Tribune publi-h the fol
lowing about our former towns
man, (.'apt. (.'has. »l. Bailev. who
along in the nineties tried to keep
a ferryboat franchise alive here:
•"In order to pay expenses of
maintaining the deer which were
taken from the ice at Williston,
post cards are being sold about the
tiiun by t'apta'.n Bailey. The
pi ice of the cards is 1 cents each
and one half of the amount re
ceived will lie put in a fund to pav
the expenses of maintaining the
animals until such time as other
suit able arrangements can be made.
Seven of the 12 deer taken from
the ice on the Missouri bottoms
are still alive, five having died as
the result of injury and the severe
exposure. One of the remaining
seven may die, but the. other six
are in good health and likely to
live.
The Dakota Congregational con
ference met at Oalie Saturday, ex
tending their sessions over Sun
day and Monday. Indian min
isters from all the reservations in
the state were to be present, as
well as a number of white mission
aries, Dr. T. L. Riggs, who for
many years has been a missionary
to the Sioux Indians, has his home
at Oahe, and conducts the church
and mission school there. He and
Mrs Riggs have for many years
devoted their lives to the rervice.
They come of pioneer missionary
families who were prominently
known in Minnesota and other
northwestern states for their ser
vice to the Indians.
A brother. Dr. Alfred Riggs, of
Santee, recently deceased, was
head of the institution there, and
the Riggs family in its various
branches has been prominent in
the development of the Indians of
the northwest.
The rainfall for May in Potter
county was something near 5.81
inches and June promises to equal
it. The highest it ever reached
was last .1 ul v, when we had 6.12,
according to the Pierre weather
bureau.
It looks as if South Dakota is
getting into the humus belt with
Minnesota and Illinois, from our
experience with the rain this year
and last vear
IVe are informed that with two
or three exceptions, all the women
who have Indian rights, who are
married to white men. are now
citizens.
This is only the first step toward
giving all those Indians who are
mentally and physically fit, their
full citizenship rights, and putting
them on their own resources.
By the decision of Judge Bottum
that Orient cannot have legal sa
loons after the first of July, on
that date there will be no licensed
saloon in Hughes, Hyde, Hand,
Sully and Stanley counties
