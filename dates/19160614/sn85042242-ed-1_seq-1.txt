Violent Fighting Is Reported in
the Vicinity of Torno-

London, June 13.—In yo&ypla and
jGalicia Russians are continuing their
strong offensive against. Austro-Hun
garians and Galicians. On various sec­
tors, in both regions, they-4}a,v| made
fresh advances and captujie^ prison
ers. vHP'J*
In Galicia'the drive lias brought t.h«
Russians across the Dnitzer river,
where they have captured tfe? towns
of Zale Szczyky and .^oi^denfca,
where they are pressing fotfwjird to­
ward the Pruth river and the Buko
wino frontier, with Czernowitch their
objective. Numerous Austrians forti
fled positions in this region have fall
en into Russian hands.
Violent fighting is taking place
around Tarnopole, while the Russians
are held back in the region of Neberg,
capital of Galicia. Northeast, of Tar
nopole, near Vorobive»va, positions
have changed hands repeatedly in the
heavy lighting, while east of Kozloe,
which lies southwest of Tanopole, the
capture of a Russian advance post is
reported by Vienna.
Drive Out Austrian?-
In Volliynia, northwest and west of
Lutsk, Russians have driven out Aus­
trians near rtojitche, and occupied
Torchin, while west of Kolki, north of
Lutsk, Austrians have again repulsed
Russians who were attempting to
cross the Styr river, inflicting heavy
losses on them.
The diversion of the' Germans on
the northern part, of the front appar
entty has not assumed greater pro­
portions. Th« Mfest Petr^grtd com
munication merely reports 1xmibard
ments at many points, while Berlin
only concedes the defeat of the caval
ry brigade in the south of Jacob
stadt, and an increase in the Rus
sian artillery fire in the region of Bar
anovichi.
Canadians Make Gains.
The Canadian troops in the region
of Ypres have made a notable gain
over the Germans, retaking from
them, southeast of Zellebeke, in
"gallant and successful assault," more
than 1,500 yards of former British po
sitions which the Germans recently
captured. The regained ground was
held despite a vigorous shelling by
t'he Germans. The Germans suffered
heavy casualties. After driving thei*
wedge into the French lines, north
east of Verdun, Monday, the German?
did not. follow up the atack with bom
bardments. Only intermittent bom
bardments are "taking place around
Verdun.
In the Lagarina valley, of the Aus
tro-Italian theater, the Italians hav«
taken Austrian positions and repulsed
heavy counter attacks. On the Post
nia-Astico front, the Austrians pene
trated Molisini, :but were later driven
out and.in the Sugana valley they met
•with considerable losses in a futile
attempt to advance east of the Maso
Torrent.

CITY 8KTAURANT
Hold-Up Man Gets Away With
$150 From St. Paul Lunch
Room.
St. Paul, 'Minn., June 13.—A lone
bandit backed Charles Kelly, a cook
in a downtown restaurant, into the
refriegerator, closed the door and ri
fled the cash register of $150. He
then walked out the front door and
made his escape.
William Brenu, a waiter, doing ki3
first night's work at the restaurant,
met the bandit as he came in thS
front door. iHe was confronted with,
a gun and told to walk to the rear of
the building. Brenu did so, stopping
for neither his coat nor his hat. He
went to the rear door and has not
been seen since. The police have
not located the bandit.

Washington, June 13—Unless- the
increasing seriousness of Mexican
forces action, the dispatch of the re­
ply to Gen. Carranza's demand for
withdrawal of American troops prob­
ably will be delayed until after the
St. Louis convention, because the ad­
ministration desires to avoid any
drastic step at a time when it might,
appear to be prompted 'by political
influences.
Th
rapid spread of anti-American
aganda in northern Mexico, how­
ever, coupled with increasing grave
economic conditions, may take the sit­
uation out of their hands.
iprop
Are At Sea.
No official would venture a predic­
tion tonight as to what might be ex­
pected in the immediate future. In
common with some consuls in Mexico,
they believe almost any eventuality is
possible. It is stated positively that
the Washington government was con­
sidering no aggressive action to be
taken of its own motion, but is ready
to act should assaults on Americans
or on Gen. Pershing's troops force the
issue.

OLD GLORY NOT THE ONLY
FLAG WE HAVE BANNER
HAS MANY "FIRST COUSINS!
Old Glory seldom flies alone.
It has a score of "first cousins."
An amazing number of secondary national
flags find a iplace with it on ships, government
buildings, array posts and with marching
troops.
The most familiar of these is the union jack.
This flag is simply a reproduction of the blue
"union" and white stars of the United States
colors. It is flown by pilot boats, is hoisted at
the bows of warships and in the bow of any
boat carrying an ambassador or minister.
American yachts fly a flag at the stern or at
the end of the mainsail gaft which has only 13
stars in the blue field arranged in a circle
around a foul anchor.- Yachts do not use the
regular national ensign.
The president of the United States has his
own flag. It has a blue field with the arms of
the nation emblazoned upon it in full colors.
The flag is carried on small boats and naval
vessels when the president is aboard.
The secretary of the navy has a blue flag
with four white stars and a white foul anchor.
The flag of the secretary of war is scarlet with
a white eagle with outstretched wings.
The admiral of the navy flies a blue flag
with four stars. The senior rear admiral's flag
is blue with two white stars that of the rear
admiral second in rank has but two white stars
on a red field, and that of the rear admiral
of junior rank is white with two blue stars.
Commodores fly pennants with a single star
in the center. The senior commodore's flag is
bluo with a white star in the center, the second
commodore's is red with a white star, and the
junior's is white with a blue star.
The commodore's flags are seldom seen now.
There are no commodores in the United States
navy at present, but the rank still exists in the
naval militia.
The revenue ensign is the most peculiar of
all the national flags. It has 16 perpendirular
red and white stripes. Its union is white with
the coat- of-arms of the nation in red and blue.
This flag is flown on customs houses and on
the ships of the loast. guard serviue.
The ships of the lighthouse service fly a
white pennant with a red border and a blue
lighthouse in the center of the white field. The

Field Headquarters, General Pershing, June 12, by radio to
Columbus, N. M., June 13.—The finishing blow was given the larq

», toy* 20 men of the Thirteenth &. Cavalary, under Captain Otto
W. Rethorst, in a dashing canyon fioht, 20 miles north of Santa
Clara, near here.
No Americans were Injured
The Americans routed 25 Villa bandits, killed three, wounding
several, and capturing all their horses and saddles, several rifles
and several thousand rounds of ammunition, crippling the band
completely. A night ride brought the Americans into the canyon
at daybreak, where they followed a fresh horse track.
Riding at a gallop, they rounded a canyon bend and came on
the bandits in a grove of pines.
It was a complete surprise. There was a rush among the Villa
followers.
Sharp Rejoinder.
A sharp rejoinder is being prepared
to the Carranza note. Some officials
consider the note insulting in some
degrees not to be tolerated.
The Americans dismounted and in three minutes routed the
bandits, who sought refuge in the mountains.
For hours, the Americans continued the pursuit.

May Call Out Guards.
Pending the reply, steps have been
in progress toward meeting any emer­
gency that may arise. The possibil
ity of calling out more militia to pro­
tect the border has been the subject
of renewed discussion among officials
The motives behind the American
prapaganda, and the precise attitude
of Gen. Carranza toward the agitation
both are subjects of speculation
Many officials are convinced that the
de facto government is tampering,
and 'believe Gen. Carranza may have
sent the note with the deliberate pur­
pose of provoking the administration
to intervention.
In dealing with the army Carranza
does not impose duties repugnant to
subordinate officers, according to
some officials for fear that some of
his orders would be disregarded.
Situation Critical.
The fact that the great bulk of the
Mexican people have only such re
ports as to what happened and what
is happening, as theTl- leaders chose to
give them, increase the danger of the
situation. A situation that might
bring bloodshed could easily be pro­
voked. The consequences probably
would be far-reaching, and the Wash
ington government be compelled to
take measures, which it has struggled
for years to avoid.
President Wilson has no intention
of changing his policy unless forced
to do so. No important dispatches
were received at the war department
today.

The nominee's day was devoted al
most exclusively to receiving callers.
There were so many of theiii at one
time that a line was formed, and they
tiled past to shake hands and chat for
a moment instead of waiting to be re
ceived alone. Several Progressive
leaders and Republican supporters oK
Colonel Roosevelt weva among them.
Suffrage Leader Active.
Suffrage leaders sought vainly to ob­
tain the nominee's views as to their
cause.
The date of his formal notification
of nomination may be definitely set
tied within a few days, as word was
received tonight that the sub-commit­
tee from the national convention
might reach here tomorrow. Mr.
Hughes' present, plan is to receive

Monday to attend a class reunion, and
the commencement exercises at

New York, June 13.—Charles E.
Hughes today defined his attitude to­
ward German-American support a#
"one of undiluted Americanism," in
his first statement issued since his ac*
ceptance of the Republican nomina­
tion for president.

My attitude is one of undiluted

Substantial Company Ready to
Enter Life Insurance
Field.
The Provident Insurance Company
with home offices at Bismarck,
which has been in the process of
formation announces that its organiz­
ation has been completed and that a
charter has been issued under the
laws of the State of North Dakota,
authorizing it to write life insurance
and that it will commence business
at once.
The officers of the company are well
known business men who promise
careful management, with an aggres­
sive but conservative policy in admin­
istering the affairs of the company.
For the present the "Provident" will
confine its business operations to
North Dakota building up a field force
as fast as possible, later it is expected
the company will operate in South
Dakota where it has many interested
stock-holders.
The policies to be issued are clean
cut business contracts with liberal
privilages and benefits, at rates that
compare favorably with those of other
conpanies.
Under the laws of the State, the
capital stock of the company as well
as the reserve deposited with each
policy must be invested only in such
securities as have the approval of
the State, so the stock and policy
reserves are supervised and safe­
guarded, making the obligations of
the company assured.
Officers of the company say it is
their plan to build an institution that
will be a factor in the development
of home industries, by the investment
of its funds in securities in localities
where they originate and to make the
company in every way a "Home Com­
pany."
The active officers are: W. C. Tay­
lor, President F. L. Conklin, Secre­
tary: Hendricka B. Beach, Assistant
Secretary and Actuary, and N. B.
Fitch, Director of Agencies, with of­
fices in the First National Bank Build­
ing.
Bismarck, with its increasing busi­
ness activities welcomes this new in­
stitution and bespeaks for it a promis­
ing future in the life insurance field,
and predicts the comnany will grow
to be a credit to the officers and stock­
holders as well as to this community.

reviewed the achievements of the

Touching on his recent visit to the
warring nations, the governor said
he learned in Germany that scientists
are trying to devise substitutes for
gasoline and rubber, which are play­
ing such an important role in the
commercial affairs of nations today.
He spoke of the future of the state
of North Dakota and of the United

conception existed in the minds of

great as those preceding. He dedi­
cated the graduates of the class to
the thought that they should always
be ready to step in and take their
places in the world.
Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the col­

Suffrage Will Treated Much

iSt. Louis, Mo., June 13.—The arriv­
al here tonight of Secretary of 'War
Baker, President WilBon's personal
representative, bearing the "presi­
dent's own draft" of the platform,
and news that he desires renomina
tion of Vice President Marchall, firm­
ly established the harmony program
for the democratic national conven­
tion opening tomorrow.
When Chairman Wm. P. McCombs
of the democratic national committee
lets his gavel sound tomorrow, lead­
ers expect all pre-convention discord
to be blended in one harmonious note.
A program of agreement upon both
presidentital and vice presidential
nominations and the platform appar­
ently were agreed upon by the lead­
ers.
Wilson Wants Marshall.
Vice presidential booms and boom
lets, around which most of the pre
convention fights have centered,-wilt­
ed away under the influence of the
iv"sopal mtssage from the Whit#
"rfWus'e fhal tihe president dMrw. Mr.
Marshall again as hia«running mate.
"The president is for the renoln
ination of Vice President. Marshall,"
was the emphatic statement tonight
from Secretary B'aker.
"So far as I know, the president
has not considered any other nomi­
nee. As to the movement started flf
my behalf, 1 am for Mr. Marshall. I
am here as a delegate from Ohio. I
ran in a popular primary pledged to
support Mr. Marshall and obviously
could not allow myself to be consid­
ered."
Presidednt's Draft.
The president's own" draft of tha
platform—a single copy—will be dee
livered by iMr. Baker to Senator
Stone of Missouri, chairman to be of
the resolutions committee. Little
change in it is anticipated. Mr. Wil­
son wrote his draft after frequent
consultations with leaders at Wash­
ington. He is said to have typewrit­
ten it himself. Although,Mr. Bbker
declined to disclose the 'president's
platform views, these outstanding
facts were learned:
Peace Tone Predominates.
The platform will dwell tentatively
on "peace," preparedness, for peace,
and prosperity.
Despite agitation by some leaders,
President. Wilson disapproved the in­
sertion of a plank criticizing the nom­
ination of a justice of the supreifie
court, or a constitutional amendment
prohibiting other justices from seek­
ing offices. He desires a platform so
it will attract members of the pro­
gressive party, but without an open
and direct invitation to the progres­
sives to swing their streilgth to the
democratic ticket.
Woman suffrage workers will he
recognized, but the platform will sug­
gest that they exhattst their efforts
for the ballot in their respective
states.
The principal plank, it was author^
itatively stated, will deal with the ad­
ministration's trials and achievements
in handling international and Mexi­
can affairs, its rapid and deliberate
steps toward "preparedness for
peace" and the administration's rec­
ord of economic and-industrial legis­
lation contributing to general pros­
perity.
Secretary Baker also brought infor­
mation on the campaign planned in
-behalf of Mr. Wilson. Spellbinding
will be the principal feature.
The president has not decided on
the part he will play in the'campaign,
according to Secretary Baker.
(Secretary Baker was besieged last
night as the probabls campaign Baa*
ager. It 'became known that Col. K.
M. House, the president's closest
friend and adviser, And -Frefl -8*

teeman, have been eliminated from
consideration.
Regarding the plan broached If
some leaders to send Jl *qi)are* dean
cut invitation to the progtesafres
oin the democrats, or to make)
fic platform overtures to that elect,
Mr. Baker said:
