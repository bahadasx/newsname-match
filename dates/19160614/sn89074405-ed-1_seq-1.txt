St. Louis, June 14.—Victory for the
suffragists in the democratic national
convention today appeared so close
that "General" Updegraff's well laid
plans to keep silent her 8,000 "march
ers" in a walk less, talkless "golden
lane" demonstration appeared likely
to be shattered. Participants had
promised their "general" faithfully,
that during the two hours of the dis
play they would not utter a sound,
and then, in the closing hours of pre
peration of a tentative draft of the
suffrage platform plank tendered them
by democratic leaders would put them
In a shouting mood.
Ideal weather favored the demonstration atul .there was hardly
a cloud In the sky.
Enthusiastic crowds thronged the avenue from the peace monu
ment to the White House.
The plank contains everything
which the suffragists have been light
ing for. It would put the party on
record as favoring the passage of a
constitutional amendment to enfran
chise women. The plank, aa drafted,,
refers to the large number of. voting
women In twelve enfranchised states,
one of the principal arguments the
#«men have been using regarding
their strength.
Members of the National American
Woman Suffrage association expected
to put their unqualified approval on
the plank today and representatives
of the woman's party already have
endorsedIt:
Suffragists today continued their
street speaking and demonstrations
and planned to appear before the res
olutions committee Thursday as if no
plank had been submitted to them,
realizing that there may be a slip be
tween the endorsement of the plank
and its acceptance by the committee.
Anti-suffragists redoubled their ef
forts to defeat the adoption of the
plank.

school for girls at Constantinople who
was arrested in April on suspicion of
espionage returned here yesterday on
the steamship Ryndam from Rotter

soon after taken ill, however, and re
mained several weeks in German hos

Preliminary Work Disposed Of.
St. Louis, Mo.. June 14.—With harmony —Ufa
When the meeting was called to ovdev Che candidates for president
and vice president bad been agreed upon, and, according to leaders,
there will be no friction over the party's declaration of principles Onljr
the phraseology of a few planks In the platform remain* to be
upon.
Despite the exported cat and dried proceedings which party
agers hope to enliven by calling upon oM campaigners to deliver ring*
lng speeches at odd momenta during the wsinns, the aevgeantH
of the convention is prepared with a tanall army of ml stents to
large crowds at all meetings.
Quite in contrast to the republican convention.in which
a score of different kinds of buttons were worn, announcing favorite
son candidates for president, there was but one button seen on dele
gates today, that carrying the likeneas-of Wilson. Delegates shouted for
Wilson, wore neckties with the name Wilson embroidered on them or
carried pictures of the president.
After the opening of the convention at noon by William F. Me
Combs, retiring chairman of the national aonunittee, the national call
for a convention was read by J. Bruoe Kreaner, secretary of the national
committee.
The program called for an opening prayer by Rev. James W. Ijee
of St. IJOUIS. Ttie reading of the list of temporary officers, already
agreed upon by the national committee was next in order. Then, the
keynote speech by the temporary chairman, Martin H. Glynn. Glynn's
speech covered a whole hour. After he concludes, the roll of states was
to be called for representation on the oommittees cm credentials, perma
nent organization, rules, order of hunliwss, platform, and committee to
notify the candidates nominated.
Adjournment, then, will be taken until noon Hiurwday.
Denunciation of the use ot the militia and armed guards against
organized workers is contained tn the proposed industrial plank, sub
mitted by Frank Pi-.Wateh, former chairman of the
committee, to Senator Stone, who will be chairman of the
committee. The proposad plftnk also declared the righl of labor
to organise.
Half an hotir -beirore ebtoveuinjt time, halTa doxen delegates
hundred spectators were in the Coliseum, Initiator the,hall bega

cal song.
There was another squabble at the convention haO o*er
the second In two days. Late last night Edward F. Goltm,
committeeman from Missouri, issued orders barring every

Charles Boeschensteln, national committeeman from Illinois, who has
represented the committee In supervising arrangements for the conven
tion. said Goltra wanted more badges' than the committee had awarded
him.
When Chief Doorkeeper Charles White of New York arrived to in
spect the building, he was told by Goltra that the building .would not be
turned over to the committee until his demands were satisfied. White
got into communication with other national committeemen and in the
meantime Goltra left Instructions for the officer on guard to let no one
In the Coliseum. White, however, took possession of the building.
The national committee adopted the design for campaign bunting
submitted by National Committeeman McLean of North Carolina. It
bears the picture of President Wilson, with the motto "America first"
in bold red letters.
Senator Ollle James was loudly cheered when he entered the con
vention hall. While the band played a medley of national aira, small
flags were distributed to the delegates, who stood waving the flags and
cheering. Prolonged cheering greeted the entrance of Bryan.
Chairman McCombs called for order at 12:81 and delivered the
Introductory speech.
When the convention got down to business shortly after noon,
there was not one element in sight to disturb the harmonious renom
ination of Wilson and Marshall.
With the convention keynote "Americanism and peace, prepared
ness and prosperity," the first session was called to order by Chair
man McComhs and 1,200 delegates, alternates and spectators packed
the hall.
Vice presidential booms wilted when word reached the convention
that the president desired the re-nomination of Marshall.
All prospects of a fight In the convention went glimmering over
night with Bryan's announcement that be did not propose to press cer
tain planks before the resolutions committee, and that he would make
campaign speeches for the Democratic nominees.
The crowd was patient, orderly and quiet. The first, real demon
stration greeted McCombs declaration:
"TV elephant Is dead, the Moose is dead. Eong live the Ameri
can Eagle."
He declared that Wilson, in the conduct of his foreign affairs
stood with Washington, Adams and Grant, who had preserved peace
with honor.
