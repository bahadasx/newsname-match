at Head.
Today is Flag Day. Today also
marks the first anniversary of the
mustering in of the Bemidji division
of the Minnesota Naval Militia. On
June 14,1915, 52 young men answer
ed the call of patriotism and became
a part of the national naval reserves.
New Volunteers.
During the past year, twelve new
volunteers have been added to the
company. Many of the men have re
ceived rating as petty officers, while
still others have been assigned spe
cial duties.
Living up to the opinion of Cap
tain Guy A. Eaton that the Bemidji
division would be one of the best tn
the state within a year's time, the
local boys repeatedly won the favor
of the officers and regulars on the
training ship during the last year's
long cruise and the several short
cruises
Go On Cruise.
Shortly after ih muster in and af
ter the fundamental drills and in
structions had been completed a
number of the Bemidji company left
for Duluth to take the ten-day short
cruise and learn the habits of a
"jackies' life on the training ship
Gopher. Since that time a number
of short cruises have been held at
which the local boys have learned the
art of a sailor's work.
Socially the organization has been
extremely active, having given two
of the most unique dancing parties
ever given in the city.
Although organized too late for
the forming of a baseball team, a
football and basketball team repre
sented the company and claimed vic
tory in several conflicts.
Boat crews have been named and
enthusiasm is at a high pitch con
cerning the first boat races which
will be held on July 4.
COLONEL ROOSEVELT
TAKEN ILL WHILE IN
NEW YORK TODAY
(By United Press)
New York, June 14.Colonel
Roosevelt suffered a severe pain in
his side here today while going to
the dock to meet his son, Kermit,
and the latter's family who arrived
from Panama. He said that the pain
was unconsequential, but seemed
quite ill.
His daughter stated that the ill
ness was inconsequential, coughing
probably straining a muscle. Other
relatives insisted that his condition
was not serious.
After meeting the transport Kil
patrick from Panama, the party went
immediately to the home of his
daughter.
While climbing aboard the trans
port, Roosevelt was given a brisk
military salute by a number of sol
diers returning from Panama. He
returned the salute.

Silent Women Make Strong Showing
for Woman Suffrage at St.
Louis Convention.
By Perry Arnold.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
St Louis, Mo., June 14.For the
first time in decades, Democracy's
hosts met in quadriennial session to
day with complete agreement on the
choice of national standard bearer.
There wasn't a delegate who didn't
agree to the renomination. of Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson.
The bitterness of the factional
strife at Baltimore four years ago
was gone. Advance indications were
for a regular "love~feast with the
only possibilities fdr any difference
of opinion present in the building of
a platform.
It was a cheerful, optimistic, cheer
ing and confident throng that re
sponded to the bang of National
Chairman William F. McComb's ga
vel. No specter of an internacine
fight intruded.
First of all, the delegates were
meeting in Missouri, one of whose
favorite sons four years ago was a
defeated candidate in the battle of
the ballots.
Home of Son.
That same favorite sonSpeaker
Champ Clarkas if to emphasize the
healing of the wounds dealt him by
the Baltimore gathering, was one of
the loudest in his praises of the man
who took frpm him the honor of
leading the Democratic hosts.
"I believe the convention can ad
journ by Friday, if it so desires,"
Chairman McCombs said just before
convening the assembly.
The delegates themselves, how
ever, indicated early in the meeting
their desire to hear "glorification"
speeches and this excess of enthusi
asm was expected to prolong the con
vention until Saturday morning.
St. Louis began playing the host to
the voting thousands in royal fash
ion. Nto-partisan committees ga
lore, whose interest and energy was
bent solely toward making visitors
comfortable and happy, were con
stantly in attendance.
First Chance to Entertain.
The convention is St. Louis' first
chance since the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition of 1904 to entertain dis
tinguished guests and St. Louisans
were determined to make the occa
sion a memorable one.
The convention hall itself had
been repainted throughout, mostly
with white paint so that every pos
sible bit of light was reflected into
its gigantic interior.
Special ventilating appartus cool
ed the sultry air. Delegates and al
ternates alone were permitted on the
ground floor, permitting more com
fortable seating space for the men
who actually do the convention work.
One topic which was eagerly dis
cussed by the crowds in the streets
and hotel lobbies was the so-called
"unit rule" and "two-thirds" regu
lation which from time immemorial
has ruled at Democratic conclaves.
There was general belief expressed
that the regular quadriennial at
tempt to overthrow these ancient
rules would succeed this year.
Two-thirds Rule Up.
Delegates recalled that the attempt
was made four years ago in Balti
more and defeated mainly because
there was such bitter strife between
the candidates. If the two-thirds
rule had not been in effect at Balti
more, Champ Clark, Missouri's fa-

Chairman Glynn, sounding
Democratic keynote.
Announcement of resolu
tions and permanent organi
zation.
Making up of the perman
roll of the convention. -ft
vorite son, would have been named.
This year, it was conceded, will be
an excellent opportunity for the
Democratic party to abolish the pre
cedent requiring a two-thirds ma
jority as necessary to a choice. There
is only one candidate in the minds
of the delegatesWilsonand this
offers a free road to revision of the
rules.
Most important also, in the minds
of the gossipers and hotel lobby de
baters, was the platform upon which
Democracy will make this year's race.
The Democrats believe they have the
"edge" on the Republicans, simply
because they will have an opportunity
to see what sort of a statement of
principles the Chicago convention
has enacted, and to meet those prin
ciples in the Democratic pledges.
2,000 Present.
Over 2,000 persons assembled here
at noon to waste time, speak, listen
to speeches, for the next three days.
Democrats used Flag Day for frenzy
patriotism Fifteen thousand flags
were distributed. The band played
the "Star Spangled Banner" when a
huge flag was unfurled from the ceil
ing All the delegates were on their
feet, waving flags in frenzy patriot
ism.
A Silent Flea.
Women staged a silent plea for suf
frage by lining the approaches of the
convention hall A concerted battery
of 5,000 pairs of eyes started speech
less at the delegates in a mute appeal
for "votes for women." The women
were dressed in white, had a yellow
sash across their shoulders and a yel
low parasol above their heads.
Former Governor Glynn of New
York acted as temporary chairman
and he-delivered the keynote speech
of the convention Paragraphic
punches in his speech follow:
Has Strong Punch.
"Today Americans must decide
whether their country shall have a
national soul. We assert the policy
of neutrality as truly American.
Neutrality is the Americans' contri
bution to the laws of the world. If
Washington was right, if Jefferson
was right, if Ifamilton was right, if
Lincoln was right, then the presi
dent Of the United States is right to-
day."
"Neutrality is the policy that kept
us at peace while Europe is driving
nails of war through crucified hu
manity. In all history of nations,
of all ages, there is not a country
which has enjoyed such a gigantic
balance of trade as has the United
States.
"Where Washington vainly plead
ed for recognition of our neutral
rights, where Jefferson sought in vain
to protect shipping, where Lincoln
failed to gain for the United States
freedom of the seas, Woodrow Wilson
has secured from every warring pow
er, from every prince under the sun,
the formal and definite assurances
that the neutral rights of America
will be respected and observed."
Young and progressive Democrats
began gathering together early to
day They made it perfectly clear
that the Democratic platform must
contain a strong bid for- the father
less Progressives or there will be a
fight.
Some Things Doing.
Despite the supposed quiet, re
porters found that a few little things
happened today.
FirstWilson has halted the pro
gram for a plank in the party plat
form against making supreme court
justices ineligible for political office.
SecondWilson favors Marshall
for vice president which seems to put
needles to other vice presidential
booms.
ThirdThe Democrats have decid
ed to adopt a tariff plank amounting
to a distinct appeal to business in
terests.
FourthBryan announced that he
will definitely support Wilson on any
proposition, even preparedness.
A demonstration for Wilson lasted
16 minutes despite the terrific heat.
Juniata county, Pa., with a popu
lation of 15,000, has found from the
county commissioner's dog tag rec
ord that there are within its borders
more than 2,000 dogs.
Although there is in Barcelona,
Spain, a supply of electricity avail
able for charging electric trucks and
passenger automobiles, such vehicles
are not to be seen there.
