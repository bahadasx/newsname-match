PROGRESSIVES WANT TEDDY.
MAY WrrHDKAW IF HUGHES
TAKES AGGRESSIVE COURSE.
John M. Parker of Louisiana Named
for Vice President as Teddy's Run?
ning Mate?-Progressives End Tbeir
Convention.
Chicago, June 10.?The Progressive
national convention, after four tu?
multuous sessions with only one pur?
pose in view, today nominated Col.
Roosevelt for president and a few
hours later listened without protest
to a message from Oyster Bay that he
j would not "accept at. this time." The
convention adjourned at 4:58 p. m.
Col. Roosevelt's declination was
^conditional and it was placed in the
hands of the Progressive national
committee to be held until such time
as statements to be issued by Justice
Hughes, the nominee of tho Republi?
can party, "shall satisfy the com?
mittee that it is for the interest of
the country that he be elected."
, In the event the committee shall be
satisfied that aid should be given the
Republican party, Col. Roosevelt's re?
fusal to make a campaign is to be con?
sidered final. It will then be author?
ised for the representatives of the
Progressive party to say whether to
Indorse the position taken by Mr.
Roosevelt or whether they will name
another man to fight for their party
principles. e
John M. Parker of Louisiana was'
nominated for vice president, the se?
lection being by acclamation.
Cot Roosevelt's running mate of
four years ago, Gov. Hiram Johnson
of California, refused to let his name
be placed before the convention
because of the information he
had concerning the intentions of
Col. Roosevelt toward his nomi?
nation. Several other names and
potably that of Raymond Robins,
who was both temporary and perma?
nent chairman of the convention were
offered but not seconded.
'C^Prlor to reading the message from
jOtater Bay some minutes were con
iHned in drawing from delegates and
I jg^^supporterH the usual sinews of
1 %<?oL Rooievelt'8 answer to the Pro?
gressive convention follows:
'The Progressive convention: I am
very grateful for the honor you con?
ferred upon me by nominating me as
president. I do not accept It at this
time. I do not know the attitude of
the candidate of the Republican party
toward the vital questions of tho day.
Therefore, if you desire an immediate
decision I must decline the nomina?
tion. But if you prefer it I suggest
that my conditional refusal to run be
placed in tho hands of the Progres?
sive national committee. If Mr.
Hughes' statements when he makes
them shall satisfy the committee that
it is for the interest of the country
that he be elected they can act ac?
cordingly and treat my refusal as defi?
nitely accepted. If they are not sat?
isfied they can so notify the Pro?
gressive party and at the same time
they can confer with me and then
determine on whatever action we may
severally deem appropriate to meet
the needs of the country*
(Signed) "Theodore Roosevelt."
PLANS TO INVESTIGATE.
Hours and Wages of Railroad Em?
ployes Considered.
Washington, June 11.?An inter?
state commerce commission investiga?
tion into the whole subject of wages
and hours of labor of railroad em?
ployes will be urged by the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States un?
der authorization of a referendum of
its members just completed and a res?
olution to direct such an inquiry, the
chamber announced tonight, will be
Introduced soon In congress.
In submitting the proposal to Its
members the national chamber em?
phasized the possibility that demands
made by four brotherhoods of rail?
road employes might result in a strike,
which, in addition to affecting direct?
ly some 300,000 workers, would se?
riously cripple the country's entire in?
dustrial system. The member organi?
zations of the chamber, comprising
commercial bodies In 43 States, voted
in favor of an Investigation, 981 to 30.
STANDARD RAISED PRICE.
Big Trust Accused off Holding Back
Gasoline.
Washington, Juno 12.?Independent
oil operators charge that the Stand?
ard Oil Company held back gasoline
when the price first began rising,
this creating a shortage and forcing
the price further up, thus reaping big
profits. The charge was made today
at the hearing by the federal trade
commission.
MAY BUY LEGATION IN BUBI.
ITEM IN DIPLOMATIC BILL FOR
PURCHASE.
Secretary of State Favors Plan Sug?
gested by Cant. Gonzales, United
States Minister.
Washington, June 8.?If the senate
concurs in the action of the house just
taken in passing an appropriation in
the diplomatic bill for the purchase of
the legation for the United States
minister to Cuba, at Habana, Capt.
William E. Gonzales, who holds that
position and who is now in Washing?
ton, will see the culmination of an
idea which he has had since he went
there to represent this government.
The present legation at Habana is
the combined residence and business
office of the minister from the United
States and in the item which has just
been agreed upon. $100,000 will be
used in the purchase of the property
and in its refitting.
It is stated that about $80,000 will
be expended for the purchase of the
land and the building now upon it.
Capt. Gonzales some time ago having
secured an option upon it to this ef?
fect. The remainder of the appro?
priation, about $20,000, will be used in
fitting up the new acquisiton in keep?
ing with the position of its occupants.
Mr. Lansing, secretary of State, in?
dorsed the proposition of purchasing
the legation very strongly, and Capt.
Gonzales gave it as his opinion some
time ago, that in all probability be?
cause of the increase in land values in
Habana the same property could not
be had for the same amount of money
at a later time.
Capt. Gonzales, who has been In
Washington for several days on offi?
cial business, was much pleased to?
day when assured that the house had
agreed to the item for the purchase
of the legation.
There seems to be no doubt that
the senate will follow the action of
the house and that in a short time the
United States will have its home for
its minister in Habana.

Spring Yield 246,000,000 Bostels Be?
low That of Last Year Due to Lato
and Wet Season.
Washington, June 8.?Present indi?
cations point to a wheat crop 300,
000,000 bushels smaller this year than
last year. Department of agriculture
forecasts today indicated a winter
wheat crop of 469,000,000 bushels,
80,000,000 bushels less than forecast
from May 1 conditions, due largely to
insects in Kansas and Oklahoma and
a spring wheat crop of 246,000,000
bushels, due to a decrease of 8 per
cent, in the acreage from last year
and to the late wet spring.
June 1 crop condition indicated less

Indications are the oat crop
will be about iO.000 bushels

EFFICIENT . iM DRAINAGE.
I -
Frequent Inf >n of Drains and
Ditches a r? ompt Repairs Neces
sary.
S
In the ?>. ; of the year, when land
is being prepared for planting, there
[are frequent complaints from farmers
that the drainage systems which they
constructed a year or more before Are
not Improving the land as they had
expected. Perhaps the soli is just as
wet as it was before Installing drain*
i age, but is this a valid reason for con?
demning drainage? To answer this'
question correctly, other questions
must first be answered. Were the
drainage improvements in the first
place properly designed and construct?
ed? If the answer to this question Is
affirmative, may not some defective
condition have developed in the sys?
tem since construction? Have the
ditches been kept open and clean or
haye they been permitted to env* In
in and deteriorate generally?.^
outlet* to the ttle-drains'Tbee
Havs the inlets and catch basi
permitted to become choked with
leaves and other dry vegetable matter
of the previous season? it these con?
ditions exist, does not the failure of
the system to give the desired results
He with the farmer rather than the
system?
In the spring, when the root syitem
of the young plant Is developing, It Is
essential that the level of the ground
water be maintained at such a depth
as always to permit free growth of
the roots downward as well as lateral?
ly. The control of the water level is
the purpose of any drainage improve?
ment. The largest returns on money
Invested In such improvements can be
obtained only when they accomplish
their real purpose, and this purpose
can be accomplished only by keeping
the drains in the best possible state
of efficiency.
To obtain the greatest degree of
efficiency in drainage improvements,
as in any other work, frequent inspec?
tion is necessary. Brush and weeds
should be cut from the banks of the
open ditches and the latter cleaned
out to the proper depth. Openings
should be made into the ditches
where necessary to permit the sur?
face water in the fields to flow off
rapidly.
In tile systems, if the outlet has
not been protected by a headwall, one
should be constructed, for unprotected
outlets arc often damaged by stock
and the action of surface water. If a
tile drain empties into an open ditch
or swale, steps should be taken to
see that sufficient fall exists in the
ditch to remove the water as fast sis
it Is discharged from the tile; other?
wise the water will back up Into the
tile and the efficiency of the drain will
be impaired. Where surface inlets
and sand traps have been Installed In
a tile system these should be examin?
ed, and cleaned If necessary.
To realize the maximum results
from any drainage system It. Is there?
fore essential that Inspection be fre?
quent and that necessary repairs be
made promptly.
