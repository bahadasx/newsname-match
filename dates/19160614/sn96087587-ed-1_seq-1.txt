baseball pla od in Klgin in r canx
years was the one hero Saturday
between the Ft. Sill Indian
school team and tho luc.nl nine.
Interest wsis running high when
the game aim im1 as a gr 1 many
had the impression thai the Flglti
hoys would go .down in defeat
before their adversaries.
This impression was not chan
ged until in the fourth inning, as
up to that timo the Indians were
in the lead. During thy lirst
inning each side made one score
nod in th second inning the In
wlintis made one score. Neither
.side scored in the third.
The Indians failed to aco-o in

luck and also struck the ball suf
'Hcient tunea to send four men
ovr the home plate, all nine of
the men going to bat before the
i .-iile was out. This chued the

The agent says that the ret
