NEUT vALITY AS AMERICAN AS THE FLAG
4-
ß on. Martin H. Glynn, Ex-Gov. New York, In Keynote Speech at St. Louis Convention
The policy T leutrality is as truly American as the Ameri
can 11 a ...
For 200 years neutrality was a theory; America ma Je it
a fact.
The first presiJetu of the United States was the lir'st man
to pronounce neutrality a rule of international conduct.
In April. 1703, Washington declared the doctrine; and
within a month, John Jay, Chief Justice of the Supreme
court of the United States, in an epoch-making decision
from the bench, whose realization would ensure universal
and perpetual peace, wrote the principle into ths law of this
land. The Declaration of Independence had foretold it lv
declaring "the rest of mankind enemies in war, in peace
friends;" the constitution recognized it; but the tirst presi
dent of the United States by proclamation, the first chief
justice by interpretation gave it vitality and power.
And so neutrality is American in its initiation.
Thirty years later Prime Minister Canning in the British
parliament pointed to this American policy of neutrality
as a modepfor the world; and eighty years later, after ap
proval by various statutes and agreements, it was written
almost word for word in the treaty wherewith we settled
our dirferences with England over violations of neutrality
throughout the civil war.
And so neutrality is American in its consummation.
And today in tliis hall, so that all the world may hear,
we proclaim that this American policy of neutrality is. the
policy which the present administration pursues wilh'patriot
ic zeal and religious devotion; while Europe's skies blaze
red from tires of war, Europe's soil turns red from blood of
men, Europe's eyes see red from tears ot mourning women
and from sobs of starving children.
The men who say this policy is not American appeal t
passion and to prejudice and ignore the facts of history.
Neutrality is America's contribution to the laws of the
world. Sir Henry Maine says so, Charles Francis Adams
says so, Henry Clay says so, Daniel Webster says so and up
on the evidence of these witnesses we rest our Americanism
against the sputterings of pepper-pot politicians or the fabri
cations of those with whom a false issue is a good bsue un
til its falsity is shown, its maliciousness exposed.
For enforcing this policy of neutrality George Washing
ton was hooted by a howling mob of io.ooo war fanatics
who threatened to pull him from the presidential chair and
start a revolution. But half a century later Charles Sumner
said that "Washington upholding the peaceful neutrality of
tins country, while he met unmoved the clamor of the peo
ple wickedly crying for war, is a greater man than Wash
ington crossing the Delaware or taking Cornwallis' sword
at Yorktown."
For supporting this policv of neutrality in a speech in the
city of New York Alexanier Hamilton was stoned almost
to "death, John Jay burned in efiigy, Jefierson called a
spineless poltroon and Lincoln pictured as a craven. Today,
however, the nation goes to all these men for its every con
ception of all that is best in American citizenship.
The fate of the fathers of our country at the hands of a
noisy minority is the fate of the president of the United
States today. But their reward of dignities merited and
honors conferred will be his reward, when the people speak
on the eighth of next November.
Neutral Rights Asserted and Maintained With Unsurpassed Vigor
No American who knows the facts can honestly oppose
(r criticise the policy of neutrality which the present demo
cratic administration has pursued. Driven from this posi
tion, by the logic of our history and the lesson of our pros
perity, carpers and defamers rush to the opposite extreme
and assert that this policy has not been enforced with sufii
cient vigor by the present administration.
Standing here with the eyes of the nation upon this con
vention, with the cold light of reason, the piercing shafts
of logic streaming upon all that we may say or do, I de
clare," with history as my witness and with fact as my proof
that the neutral rights of American citizens have never been
so successfully maintained as they have been asserted and
maintained by the president of the United States during the
present war. "
America's doctrine of neutrality never meant that this
nation must rush headlong into war at the tirst invasion of
its neutral rights. Neutiality is not a liair-triggered policy
that explodes in violence at the tirst assault. It is a policy
that has proved successful because it has always been as'-
serted through negotiation rather than through force,
through diplomacy rather than by an appeal to arms. This
does not mean that America will not resort to war when all
other means of protecting its neutral rights have failed, but
it does mean that America will exhaust every peaceful
means of protecting those rights before it takes the step
from which there is no appeal. Just as in domestic affairs
the penal statutes cannot wholly suppress arime, so in for
fign aifairs the law of neutrality cannot entirely prevent the
Irerch of neutrality rights. 'There has scarcely been a
wai sree the principle of neutrality was embodied in inter
na!' 311a! law, in which some neutral citizens have not been
killed, in which some neutral trade has not been interfered
with.
A judicial review of relative values, a distinction between
honor and sensitiveness, a consideration of life as well as
property, a proper equation of conditions and circumstances
are elements of neutrality's law.
One hundred and twenty years ago when Europe went
mad with war as it has gone' mad today Jefferson pointed
io the north star of our policy of neutrality when he said
"in the present maniac state oY Europe we should not esti
mate the point of honor by the ordinary scale." The reason
ing which made this a sound rule in "the maniac state of
Europe" in Jefferson's day makes it an equally strong rule
in "the maniac state of Europe" today.
This nation, let us never forget, has always remembered
that neutrality is a policy which is asserted against nations
at war, against nations inflamed and disordered. It has
always been wise enough to proceed with calmness and
patience, and events have ever justified its willingness to
appeal from Philip drunk with war to Philip sobered by rea
son and reflection.
Read Text For Digest of Times Like These When We Didn't Go To War and This;
But, say our critics, this policv satisfies no one.
They mean it does not satisfy those who would map out
a new "and untried course for this nation to pursue, but they
forget it does satisfy those who believe the United States
.should live up to the principles it has professed for a century
and more.
Chief Justice White of the United States' Supreme court
(and his opinion is just as good as that of the Ex-Mr. Justice
Ih.ghes), says this policv has given America the greatest
diplomatic victory of the past generation. Maximilian Har
den, Germany's 'noted editor, says "that never once has
this' republic violated its neutrality," and Gilbert K. Ches
terton, the famous English journalist, says, "It is the duty
nf the' president of the Unites States to protect the interests
of the people of the United States." that "he can't dip his
countrv into hell just to show the world he has a keen eense
ut being an individual saviour."
This policy may not satisfy those who revel in destruction
and find ple'asure in despair. It may not satisfy the fire
eater or the swashbuckler. But it does satisfy those who
worship at the altar of the God of Peace. It does satisfy
and lireside no
It does satisfy
the mothers of the land at whose hearth
jingoistic war has placed an emptv chair.
the daughters of this land from whom bluster and brag has
sent no loving brother to the dissolution of the grave. It
does satisfy the fathers of this land and the sons of this land
who will tight for our flag, and die for our flag when reason
primes the rifle, when honor draws the sword, when justice
breathes a blessing on the standards they uphold.
And whom, we ask. will the policy of our opponents satis
fy, and for how long? Fighting for every degree of injury
would mean perpetual war and this is the policy of our
opponents, deny it how they will. It would not allow the
United States to keep the sword out of the scabbard as long
as there remains an unrighted wrong or an unsatisfied hope
between the snowy wastes of Siberia and the jungled hills
of Borneo. It wo'uld make America as dangerous to itself
and to others, as destructive and as uncontrollable as the
cannon that slipped its moorings in Victor Hugo's tale of
,(. It would give us a war abroad each time the lighting
cock of the European weather vane shifted with the breeze.
It would make America the cockpit of the world.
