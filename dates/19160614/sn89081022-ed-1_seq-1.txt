language and is an authority on dif
ferent vernaculars of India. He has
arrived for a short stay in America
while enroute from India to Norway.
He will speak in the Park auditorium

VETERAN ENGINEER
RECEIVES LAST CALL
Geo. W. Tyler, Ex-Mayer Of
WiHmar and Prominent
Citizen, Is No More.
This community was shocked Mon
day afternoon when it was learned
that George W. Tyler, veteran Great
Northern engineer, and pioneer citi
zen of this city, had passed to the
Great Beyond. It was not generally
known that he was critically ill, and
when word of his death was passed
around, it seemed almost unbeliev
able.
On Thursday he complained1 of
pain in his head and throat, and the
next day it was found he had mumps.
He was not seriously ill until Sunday
evening, when an abcess in the throat
developed, and his condition became
critical. Dr. Dunemoor of Minneap
olis was rushed to his bedside, and
everything known to medical science
was done to save him, but to no avail.
The end came at two-thirty Monday
afternoon.
George Wilmot Tyler, son of Har
vey and Abagail Tyler, was born at
Montrose, Penn., on November 16,
1850. His youth was spent at Mont
rose, and his schooling was received
in the common schools of that place.
In 1872 he came to Willmar, but
did not remain here thent going to
St. Paul, where he resided for two
years. He then returned to this city,
and here he lived until the time of
his death. In 1877 he was united in
marriage with Miss Emilie Brown,
daughter of Judge and Mrs. J. H.
Brown' of Willmar.
He entered the service of the rail
road company forty-six years ago next
September. The road was at that
time known as the St. Paul and Paci
fic, and Mr. Tyler was brakeman on
the local, which ran from St. Paul to
Delano and return. On his return to
this city he secured a job as fireman,
and soon was running an engine. In
point of service he was the oldest en
gineer on the Great Northern system,
for nearly twenty years having one
of the runs between Willmar and
Sioux City.
In 1887 he was elected an alderman
from the second ward, and served in
this capacity continuously until 1892.
In 1899 he was again chosen alder
man, serving until 1901. In the latter
year he was elected Mayor, being the
first executive when Willmar was in
corporated as* a city. He was re
elected again in 1902. He was promi
nently identified with the Masonic and
Elk's lodges, being Past Worshipful
Master and Past Exalted Ruler of the
local orders. He was, at the time of
his death, Chief Engineer of the local
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
a position he had held for many years.
Mr. Tyler was a man of sterling
qualities, respected by all who knew
him-, and loved by his friends and as
sociates. Quiet, genial and humorous,
he was always the same. As one of
his Sioux line associates remarked,
"George never had a grouch, but was
always pleasant." His interest in
children and their love for him is well
known. A devoted husband and fath
er, a kind friend, a good neighbor, a
real man, he is sincerely mourned by
all who knew him.
Besides the widow and! the only
son, George H. Tyler, county attorney
of Sherburne county, he is survived
by a half-sister living in Pennsylvania.
An only brother was killed in the Civ
il War.
The funeral services were held this
Wednesday afternoon at two thirty
at the house. Rev. E. R. Todd, rector
of St. Luke's church officiated. The
burial service at Fairview cemetery,
was in charge of Sharon lodge, No.
104, of which the deceased was a mem
ber.
The honorary pall bearers were:
Judge George Muller, Alton Crosby,
M. Jorgenson, J. F. Barrett, John Cos
tello, and Ludwig Wold.
The active pall bearers were: A. N.
Lewis, F. L. Smith, C. H. Carey, Chris
Ackerman, George M. Winney and J.
T. Carruthers.
