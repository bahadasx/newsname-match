what he termed "suggestions" from the
President for possible incorporation in

disclose for publication, although he
tock into confidence several senators.
Ore of the suggestions which I am
told has the President's personal ap1

I
as follows

Mr. Bryj^n promptly relieved their 1

BY EARL GODWIN.
ST. LOl'IS. June 14.?The
district of Columbia delegation
o the democratic convention will
tart today to make its fight for a
dank in the democratic platform
iledging the party to a liberal
reatment of the National Capital,
[lie proposal which will be ofercd
to the resolutions commit
ee is in the form of a plank, w riten
by the chaignan of the deleration.
Robert F.. Mattingly. and'
s as follows:
"We are in favor of complete
lame rule and self-government in
he District of Columbia and in
he territories: and favor the 1
iiiJddl ii CclLIIICII L UV Lite III' }
ional government and TJongress j
11 the maintenance of the na- |
ion's capital: and we pledge our
arty to every effort to provide
ur a civil service retirement of
ederal employes' as well as coinen-ation
for disabled governtent
servants."
Colpoys for Besolutions.
John B. Colpoys will be the member
f the District of Columbia delegation
y be placed on the resolutions com;ittee
which is to frame the platform,
nil it is expected this committee will
ieet soon after the convention ad
jurns some time this afternoon.
The presence of Mr. Colpoys 0:1 the
esolutions committee was the result of
direct suggestion from Samuel
rompers. president of the American
'^deration of Labor, who is here
.atching for every opportunity to
trengthen the chances of the proposed
ibor planks in the democratic platorm.
Colpoys is secretary of theCenial
Labor Union of the District, and a
pecial commissioner of the Labor Department
will act as a spokesman for
'resident (Jumpers when the commitee
gets down to its deliberations.
Mr. Colpoys will urge the adoption
f the plank for liberal treatment of
he National Capital, and he will havf;
ehind- him the entire District delegaion.
It had been suggested and cxectcd
in some quarters that Louis
irownlow, Commissioner of the District
f Columbia, would go on the resoluions
committee, and had this been the
use, according to Mr. Brownlow hirnelf,
there would have been scarcely
ukewarm support for any plank proofed
that would savor of a support
or the half-and-half scheme of appro
Gompers Early on the Job.
However, President Gompers was
arly on the job, and having: conferred
fith National Committeeman Costello
nd other members of the delegation,
L was decided that John Colpoys shall
onduct the fight for a District plank
nd at the same time take up the
laims of organized labor.
This will, of course, include the vital
ubject of civil service retirement,
ompensatjon for injured employes, a
linlmum wage law and other legislaion
for the benefit of government
workers which has attracted so much
ttention in Washington during the
ast session of Congress. The delegaioii
discussed the matter of the Dlsrlct
of Columbia plank and decided
bat there would not be time to enter
nto a technical discussion of the halfnd-half
subject before the resolutions
ommittee, and that It would be a beter
plan, practically speaking, to slmdy
ask for an indorsement of liberal
reatment.
For Betterment Plank.
President Gompers and Secretary
'rank Morrison of the American Fedration
of Labor, Joseph Valentine of
'incinnati and others will appear beore
the resolutions committee in adocacy
of civil service retirement and
he other government employes' planks,
'he other planks urged by organized
abor, and to be advocated In the comnittee's
executive sessions by the Disriot
of Columbia's representative. Mr.
!olpoys explained aa follows In a copy
>f the proposals to be laid before the
lommittee:
The fundamental step in national
reparedness for development and
rrowth, as well as for defense. Is eduatlon
that will develop the power and
acuities of all citizens, and will enable

Keynote Speec
An Appeal to
Insists Policies of President
Traditions of Count
Existence <
ST. LOUIS. June 14.?With the assertion
that no President since the civil war has had
as crucial problems to solve, and no President
has displayed a grasp more sure, a states
mansip more profound, as President uuson,
Matrin H. (ilynn, former Governor of New
YORK, opened the democratic national convention
here today, as temporary chairman. .
Declaring that "Americanism and peace,
preparedness and prosperity are the issues
upon which the democratic party stands, and
the heart of democracy swells with pride that
is more than a pride of party as it hails the
man who has asserted this Americanism, assured
this peace, advocated this preparedness
and produced this prosperity," he predicted
the re-election of President W ilson.
Taking up our foreign relations that have '
been called into emphatic prominence by the
world-wide war, the speaker declared that
"we have entered this hall as democrats; we
^hall deliberate as Americans."
TRULY AMERICAN POLICY.
The policy of neutrality, lie argued, is as
truly American as the American flag For 200
years neutrality was a theory; America made
it a fact.
"It took Washington and his successors
eighty years of endless negotiation to win
recognition of American neutrality," he said.
"And this eighty years of struggle wove the
doctrine of neutrality so closely into the warp
and woof of otrr national life that to tear it out
now would unravel the very threads of our
existence." By the records of history M.r.
tilvnn maintained that if Washington and Lincoln
were right, President Wilson is right.
The neutrality that President Wilson stands
for today was advocated by Washington, by
Hamilton, hv lefferson and bv Lincoln.
By citing precedents Mr. Glynn justified
and defended the course of the President in
the Lusitania and similar incidents.
CITES REPUBLICAN PRECEDENTS.
"In the face of this record," he asked, "do
republicans realize that when they arraign the
policy of the President of the United States
today they arraign the policy of Harrison, of
Blaine, of Lincoln and of Grant? For the
pleasure of criticising a democratic President
are they willing to read out of the republican
party the greatest men the republican party
ever had ? Are they willing to say that the
republican party of today condemns what
Hamilton did in revolutionary days, what Lincoln
did in civil war days and what Grant and

"In his policy of peaceful negotiations today

the example set him by the greatest Presidents
which the democratic party and the greatest
Presidents the republican party ever gave this
nation.
MESSAGE TO THE WORLD.
Mr. Glynn impressed on his hearers that
it v\as the business of this convention, "representing
every section of the United States,
speaking for every racial strain in America,
to send forth a message to all the world that
will leave no room for doubt.
"We must enable every real American to
stand up and assert his Americanism. W e must
make the issue so clear that every ballot box
in the land may become a monument to the
loyalty of American manhood.
''The citizens of this country must stand
behind their President because his policies are
right. They will stand behind him because his
policies are the policies which have brought
the nation a century of prosperous and honored
peace. They will stand behind him because
they want these policies continued, that prosperitv
prolonged, that peace assured."
PLEDGES OF PARTY KEPT.
l ie pointed out that the promise made four
years ago that a democratic administration
would liberate the nation from the chains of
industrial tyranny has been carried out. He
eulogized the federal reserve act and declared ~
that the "scholar-statesman, whose rod has
struck the golden rock of America's resources,
to set free the wealth imprisoned for half a
century, is a .Moses who has led America's industries
from the wilderness of doubt and
despair to the promised land of prosperity and
hope."

stifling competition, the trades commission

fore had there been such a union
spontantous public demonstration.
Included in the ranks of marchers
were persons from all walks of life.
Not only did the chief executive of the
I land join in the demonstration, but
also members of his cabinet, the men ]
who preside over the great departments
of the government and upon
whom rests much of the responsihility
of the safety of the ship of state.
I Statesmen from the halls of Congress
also were in the parade, and with them
marched jurists from federal and local
courts, high government officials and
thousands of other government work
ers, organized military units, members
of patriotic, fraternal, civic, social and
scientific organizations, educators and
students, school teachers and hundreds
of their charges and hundreds of plain
American citizens not connected with
any one organization, but who added
to the greatness of the spectacle by
their participation as Individuals.
Although it was a great demonstration
in favor of preparedness, the fact
that this is Flag day was not overlooked
for an instant by the marchers.
Every one of the thousands of persons
in the parade carried at least one
flag, and some carried several. Never
was historic Pennsylvania avenue more
ablaze with the national colors.
AddTess on "America First.*'
Besides marching himself and then
reviewing the parade the President
had prepared an address on "America
First," to be delivered in the afternoon
at an open-air meeting south of
the White House.
Washington was brilliantly decorated
for the occasion. It was a holiday, for
under an executive order by the President
all government employes were
excused from work, and many stores
were dosed. The celebration was
planned in part as a response to a
proclamation issued by the President
calling upon the people of the nation
to celebrate Flag day this year with
special ceremonies.
The parade was planned as a strictly
non-partisan affair.
President Wilson decided to set a
precedent by walking on foot during
the entire length of the.parade. Former
Presidents Roosevelt and Taft also had
been invited, but found it impossible
to participate.
I Beginning: at the Peace Monument, near
the Capitol building, the line of march
passed the Post Office and Treasury I>epaiiment
buildings, and then reached the
White House, where a reviewing stand,
draped with American flags, had been
erected. There the program provided that
the President should leave the head of
the parade and enter the stand with the
members of the executive committee. Ar- !
rangements had been made to have Mrs.
Wilson and members of the cabinet I
join him to watch the remainder <?f j
the line pass by.
CROWD'S ENTHUSIA
STRIKING FEATU
Scenes and incidents of a gay as well I
as a grave character furnished inter-I
esting ssde lights in Washington's pre- j
paredness parade today. One of the I
most striking features of the whole big j
procession was the enthusiastic ap- |
plause of the crowds which lined the j
route of march, this being at time^
so great in volume that it completely
drowned out the music of tiie Marine
Band and other big bands.
As the President led the big procession
up Pennsylvania avenue, flanked
on one side by Chairman Gude of the
citizens' executive committee, and cn
the other by Rudolph Kauffmann, treasurer
of the committee, the crowd went
wild, apparently, as 9th street and
Pennsylvania avenue was reached, and
the Marine Band struck up the opening
notes of "Down on tne Suw aiice

1 No regular military organizations
were permitted to march because
Secretaries Baker and Daniels thought
it would he improper for professional
soldiers or sailors to participate. The
National Guard of the District of Columbia,
the Washington High School
Cadets and several other volunteer
military bodies were assigned to prominent
places.
Secretaries Baker. Daniels and Hous
ton were out of the city attending the
democratic national convention at St.

agreed to march at the head of the
officials and employes from their departments.

A Flag in Every Hand. /
American flags were distributed to
every marcher just before the parade
started. Nearly every hand in Washington
and Baltimore had been pressed
into service and it was necessary to
haw some of them march by the reviewing
stand several times in order
to lead different organizations. The
United States Marine Band was placed
just ahead of the President.
The parade was under the direction
of Lieut. Gen. S. B. Ai. Young, honorary
grand marshal, and M. O. Hazen. grand
