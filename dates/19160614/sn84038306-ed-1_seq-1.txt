miles north of Santa Clara, near here.
No Americans were hurt.
Tho Americans routed 25 Villa ban
dits, killing three, wounding several,
and capturing all their horses and
saddles, some rifles and several thou
sand rounds of ammunition, crippling
the bond completely.
A night ride brought the Americans
Into a canyou at daybreak, where they
followed fresh horse tracks. Riding
at a gallop, they rounded a canyon
turn within two hundred yards of the
bandits, camped in a grove of pines.
It was a complete surprise. There was
a headlong rush among the Villa fol
lowers, who, half-clad, seized rifles
and fought from behind trees.
Returning to the Mexican bivouac
the Americans added the bandits*
breakfast to their own repast. The
bandits bad only beef and coffee.

The storm Tuesday night must

Petrograd Says Only Small Number of
Prisoners Was Taken Durihg tho
—Germans Halt Slavs.
Petrograd, June 14.—The Austrian
army is retreating so rapidly In Gall
da that the Russians have been un
able to catch up with them In the last
few days. The result is that fewer
prisoners have been taken, according
to an official statement given out here.
The total number of captives now
In Russian hands Is 115,700, as com
pared with 114,700 announced yester
day. The statement says:
"On account of the fact that in many
places the
Austro-Hungarian
and Aus-
tro-German troops withdrew rapidly
before the blows of our southern army,
the number of prisoners has In
creased only very little. The total
now amounts to about 1,700 officers
and 114,000 men.
"The enemy left enormous quanti
ties of military booty everywhere in
the territory evacuated."
In an effort to relieve the pressure
on their allies, the Germans around
Jacobstadt, southeast of Riga, have
opened a violent offensive. Here the
kaiser's forces won temporary suc
cesses, but were forced back to their
own lines under the heavy Russian
lire.
In the region south of Krevo the
Teutonic armies penetrated a wood
west of Wotchany and still hold part
of It.
The Austrlans, aided by Germans,
have also furiously counter-attacked
north of Buczacz. northwest of Czer
nowitz, and the Russians admit being
forced to give way before General von
Bothmer's troops.
Berlin, June 14.—Reporting minor
victories at several points In the fight
to stop the powerful Russian offensive,
the Austrian official war office report,
received here, declares Russian losses
"correspond to the reckless use of
masses made by the Russians." The
statement says:
"In northeastern Bukowlna Austro
Hungarian troops disengaged them
selves from the enemy under heavy
rear-guard
fighting. German and Aus­
tro-Hungarian regiments, by a counter
attack, drove back a hostile force ad
vancing northwest from Buczacz.
Thirteen hundred Russians were cap
tured.
"Violent fighting continues north
west of Tnrnopol. The positions near
Vorobievkn (northwest of Tarnopol),
which have been mentioned repeated
ly, changed hnnds several times.
"West of Kolkl we repulsed a Rus
sian attempt to cross the river."
The German officinl statement fol
lows
"On the Dvlna, southeast of Dubena
