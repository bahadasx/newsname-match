11 uglies Resigns .Justiceship.
Washington. June 10.-Charles
Ryans Hughes resigned to-day from
the Supreme Bench and accepted the
Republican nomination for President.
In a telegram denouncing the admin
istration's foreign policies and de
claring for a "dominant, thorough
going Americanism," he gave nls de
cision to Chairman Harding, of the
Republican National Convention,
and broke the long silence which had
kept the leaders of his party in the
dark as to his attitude on what they
termed the great issues of the day.
"I have not desired the nomina
tion," tho telegram began. "I have
witched to remain on the bench. But
In thlB critical period of our national
history 1 recognize that it ls your
right to summon and that lt is my
paramount duty to respond."
Within an hour after Chairman
Harding had notified him of his nom
ination Mr. Hughes had accepted the
call. His resignation, a scant two
line letter without a superfluous
word, was on its way to tho White
House from tho Hughes home before
th 1 nominee had dispatched the mes
sage of acceptance. President Wil
son accopted the resignation In a re
ply almost as brief.
When copies of both the telegram
>gressive Conven
dsntial Candidates
to Chicago and thc lotter of resigna
tion had boon made public, Mr.
Hughes left his homo for htH cus
tomary afternoon walk. Soon after
his return Lawrence Creen, his pri
vate secretary, told him of Col.
Roosevelt's conditional declination of
tho Progressive nomination. Mr.
Hughes sent word to Inquirers that
he had nothing to say concerning it.

Chica'go, June 10.-Tho Progres
sive National Convention, after four
tumultuous sessions, with only one
purpose In view, to-day nominated
Col. Theodore Roosevelt for Presi
dent, and a few hours later listened,
without protest, to a message from
Oyster Bay that he would not "accept
at this Hmo." The convention ad
journed at 4.f>8 p. m.
Col. Roosevelt's declination was
conditional, and it was placed in the
hands of the Progressive National
Committee to be held until such time
as statements to be issued by Justice
Hughes, the nominee of the 'Republi
can party, "shall satisfy the commit
tee that it is for the interest of the
country that he be elected."
In the event tho committee shall
be satisfied that aid should bc given
the Republican party, Col. Roose
velt's refusal to make a campaign is
to bc considered dual, lt will then
bo authorized for the representatives
of the Progressive party to say whe
ther to endorse the position taken by
Mr. Roosevelt or whether they will
name another man to fight for their
party principles.
John M. Parker, of Louisiana, was

four years ago, Governor Hiram
Johnson, of California, refused to let.
his name bo placed beforo the con

that of Raymond Robins, who was
both temporary and permanent chair
man of tho convention-were ofier
ed, hut nono seconded.
Roosevelt's Response.
Col. Roosevelt's answer to the
Progressive Convention follows:
"Tho Progressive Convention: ?
am vory grateful for thc honor you
conferred upon me by nominating
me as President. I do not accept it
at this time. I do not know tho at
titude of tho candidate of the Repub
lican party toward the vital ques
tions of the day. Therefore, if you
desire an immediate decision 1 must
decline the nomination. But, If you
profer it, I suggest that my condi
tional refusal to run <bo placed in the
hands of tho Progressive National
Committee. If Mr. Hughes' state
ments, when he makes them, shall
satisfy tho committee that it is for
th-- interest of tho country that he
ho cloded they can act accordingly
and trout my refusal as definitely ac
cepted. If they are not satisfied tnoy
can so notify the Progressive party,
and at the saino timo they can con
fer with me and then determino OM
whatever action wo may severally
deem appropriate to moot tho nedda
of tho country.

Who Porker ls.
Now Orleans, June ll.-John M.
Parker has been active in Louisiana
politics since 1886. Ho was defeated
for Governor on the Progressiv?
ticket In the State election in April
last. Ile always had hoon a Demo
crat until the Progressive party wan
formed, and was prominently Identi
fied with almost every reform mo ve
rnon I within tho Democratic party In
the city of 'Now Orleans. Ho never
held public office.
For many years ho has boon an In
timate friend of Col. Roosevelt, and
when the Prog rossi ve party was or
ganized in 19 12 Mr. Parker Joined
that organization. An evidonco of
his personal popularity was soon lu
tho vote givon him as the Progres
sive candidato for Governor last
April, when ho received almost 60,
000 votos against tho successful can
didato of tho Democratic party, which
seldom has lind opposition in tho
elections.
Mr. Parker ls 53 yoars old and waa
born on a plantation near Port Gib
son, Miss. Ho lived in New Orleans
about 40 years and owns several
large plantations nnd is a prominent
cotton factor of this city.
Not Altogether Unanimous.
Now York, Jun? ll.-The New
York delegates to tho Progrossivo
Convention at Chicago returned on a
special train with anything but una
nimity of feeling as to whnt course
their party should pursue. It seem
ed to bc tho consensus of opinion,
howevor, that if Col. Roosevelt makes
positive his tentativo rofusal to bo a
candidate for tho Presidency, some
other man should be solected by tho
national executive committeo of tho
party to fill the vacancy.
John J. O'Connell, chairman of the
county committee, declared tho Pro
grossivo party "will not desert tho
principles" for which it has stood.
"This muon ls certain," ho said,
"the national executive committee of
our party hereafter will not permit
any man not n member of tho com
mittee to invado its deliberations
and that applies to m em be rn.
"lt don't want Col. Roosovolt to
finally decline the nomination of the
party, but if he should I certainly do
not expect the rom mit tee on vacan
cies to select Justice Hughes to take?
, his place."

hours pleasantly and profitably in
