.'Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United- States, was nominated to-day
for the Presidency by the Republic
an national convention.
Charles Warren Fairbanks, of In
diana, elected Vice President with
Theodore Roosevelt In 1904, again
was chosen for second place on the
Republican ticket.
Both nominations, made by over
whelming majorities on the first bal
lot of the day the third of the con
vention were by acclamation made
unanimous.
Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts,
presented by Col. Roosevelt as a
compromise candidate, received
seven votes. Col. Roosevelt himself
received eighteen and one-half votes
scattered over twelve States.

Mr. Hughes will be notified offi

ed by Senator Warren G." Harding,
of Ohio, chairman of the convention.
Mr. Fairbanks will be notified by
a committee headed by Senator Wil
liam E. Borah, of Idaho,
At 2:01 p. m. the convention ad
journed. There were expressions of
harmony from all the leaders and
among the delegates. The delega
tions which on the final ballot had
cast votes for others-than Mr.Hughes
made statements declaring their loy
alty to the nominees.
Vie nomination of Mr. Hughes
was made possible so soon by an ov
ernight break-up of all the allied
favorite sons' combination, which,
early this morning released Its dele
gates, practically all of whom were
known to favor Mr. Hughes when
freed from their instructions.
When the convention began busi
ness shortly before noon the with
drawal of the favorite sons was an
nounced from the platform 'one af
ter another, and the votes- began
flopping into tho Hughes column In
solid blocks so rapidly that the nom
ination plainly was assured before
the roll-call had gone five States.
VWnen It jot to Colorado tho drift
was so apparent that a roposa: to
make It unanimous or nominate him
by acclamation was made, but Chair
man Harding ruled that the ballot
IngMhould take its regular course.
Wkh addition to tl)e Hughes col
vmn wis greeted by yells of exulta
tion from the rapidly accumulating
Hugjup delegates and steadily, State
by sT,ate, ,the votes plied un until
New Jersey carried It past the re
quired 494 and the remainder was
only a formality.
In rapid succession as the voting;
went on, Du Pont was wltairawn by
Delaware and his solid bleek was
D
RBANKS
cast for Hughes; Illinois withdrew
Sherman, Ohio withdrew Burton,
Iowa withdrew Cummins, Now York
withdrew Root, Massachusetts with
drew Weeks. Practically all these
now votes were cast for Hughes,
only a few remaining In compliment
to the favorite sons who brought
them.
Then ono after the other, Senator
Weeks and Senator Lodge took the
platform, pledged loyalty to the
nominee and asked all their support
ers to do likewise. Similar an
nouncements were made from all the
favorite son delegations. The final
analysis of the nominating ballot
showed that Hughes hajd drawn his
votes from every State In the union
and every territory; that Roosevelt's
had been scattered over twelve
States; that Du Pout's five had come
from South Carolina; Lodge's seven
from North Carolina and the. final
three for Senator Weeks had come
from Massachusetts and Missouri.
Although the convention, when It
nominated Mr. Hughes, had no word
that ho would accept and no state
ment of his position, one came along
soon afterward, but not until the
conventloniad adjourned. The for
mer Justice had kept to his deter
mination to utter no word in his
own behalf, to make no new an
nouncement of his position on Is
sues, and to say nothing which
might be construed as becoming a
candidate while he wore the robe of
a Justice in tho world's greatest
court.

from Chicago with a detailed report
of the happenings at both tho Re

Col. Roosevelt attended church
services in the village this morning
with Mrs. Roosevelt, but remained
in seclusion at Sagamore Hill the
rest of the day. The telegraph wlre3
last night and to-day brought a
flood of messages to Col. Roosevelt.
It was announced that most of them
approved his action In declining to
become a candidate upon the Pro
gressive ticket.
While Col. Roosevelt would not
discuss, the question to-day his Inti
mates considered It 'altogether un
likely that he would reconsider his
conditional refusal to head a third
ticket. He has not yet made It
clear whether or not he will sup
port the candidacy of Mr. Hughes.

THE CONVENTION IS STUNNED
Roosevelt Ht-'fiiMV Nomination.
Auditorium, Chicago, June 10.
Col. Roosevelt's answer to the Pro
gressive convention follows;
"To the Progressive Convention:
"I am very grateful for the honor
you confer upon me by nominating
me as President. I cannot accept It
at this time. I do not know the at
titude of the candidate of the Re
publican party toward tho vital
questions of the day. Therefore If
you desire an Immediate decision I
must decline the nomination. Uut
If you prefer It, I suggest that my
conditional refusal to run be placed
In the hands of the Progressive Na
tional Committee. If Hughes' state
ments when he makes them shall
satisfy the committee that It Is for
the Interest of the country that he
be elected, they can act accordingly
and treat my refusal ns definitely
accepted. If they are not satisfied
they can so notify the Progressive
party, and at the same time they can
confer with me and then determine
on whatever action we may severally
deem appropriate to meet the needs
of the country.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
On motion of James R. Garfield,
Col. Roosevelt's letter was formally
approved by the convention.
Convention Stunned.
Auditorium Hall. Chicago, June
10. Theodore Roosevelt was nomi
nated to-day by the Progressive Na
tional convention after four days of
uproar and tumult in which the del
egates never wavered In allegiance
or cast a passing glance upon anoth
er man.
Three minutes before the conven
tion adjourned until another time,
Chairman Raymond Robins read to
them a brief message from Oyster
Bay, In which Mr. Roosevelt declin
ed to accept the nomination at this
time. Few of the thousands In the
vast auditorium, some of whom had
seen the Colonel named in an even
wilder burst of enthusiasm four
years ago, realize when Robins rap
ped his gavel at 4:38 and declared
the convention adjourned slno die,
that In a few hours or a few weeks
they might bo a party without the
one leader to whom they had come
to Chicago to give the pledge of loy
alty and faith.
The significance of Mr. Roosevelt's
message with Its announcement
that If the Progressive National
Committee found the subsequent
statements of Charles Evans IIughc3,
the Republican standard bearer, to
its liking, his non-acceptance of the
Progressive nomination should stand
ns his last word, was lost In that
tired throng, worn out by Its own
enthusiasm, by long delays over
peace parleys with the Republicans
and by the discussion of a platform,
on which It must go Into the field,
if at all, against both the forces of
Democracy and Republicanism.
None of the feeling that some of
them later betrayed when they had
had opportunity to digest the Colo
nel's statement had time to flaro out
when the gavel fell. They trooped
out Into Chicago's streets for home
while the band played faintly and
the flags that had flaunted eo proud
ly through nil the stormy session
were folded and the banners put
away.
