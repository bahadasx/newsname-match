Directors-
Next Monday circuit court will open
at Jamestown. The attendance is
usually large, and unless wheat har
vesting interferes there vill be a large
number orthe yeomanry at tne open
ing. There are a number of fancy
horses on exhibition generally at the
Russell courts, and some foreign buy.
ers will likely put in an appearance.
The wheat in Adair county has come
oat wonderfully in the last three i
weeks, and at this time it is safe to
say more than an average crop will be
cut. One farmer told the News last
Friday that he had the best crop he
ever grew.
. Ed Lee Grady, of color, who was
killed at Lebanon by J." H, Shlvely, a
white man. was a son of Curt Grady,
this place. The boy was buried at
Lebanon and Shively was arrested for
the crime, and was acquitted.
Clemens, a little son of Mr. E. L.
Sinclair, who was operated on in St.
Anthony Hospital, Louisville, for ap
pendicitis, Is doing nicely and will
probably be out in about one week.
We advise our correspondents not to
take up time and paper writing about
neighborhood visits. We want the
news, crop prospects, deaths, births,
marriages and accidents and serious
sickness.
Mr. Geo. H. Nell, who was in the
Blue-Grass section of the State last
week, says theiWBfc crops of wheat
he ever saw are now about ready to be
harvested.
Columbia District Conference.
The Columbia District Conference
of the Methodist Church convened at
Jamestown last Thursday forenoon,
All the churches in theHstrictyvere
represented by two or more delegates,
and an interesting program- was car
ried out, the session closing Sunday
night with a discourse by Eevr J.
Kobt. Marrs . .
During the session there were a
number of able discourses delivered,
especially the one Thursday morning
by Bev. J. S. Chandler, ,pastor of the
Church at Campbellsville. His sub
ject was "The DivineCall toPreach the
Gospel," and it was handled in a Mas
terly manner. The song service was
led by Messrs. Smith and Thomas
throughout the meeting, and the
choir was made up with many of the
best singers in the district.
Mrs. S. G. Shelly's address, "The
-Work of the Women in the Evaugeli
zation of the World,'' highly enjoyed
by all. The Presiding Elder, Kev.S.
G. Shelly was busy all the time. His
address Sunday, "Call to service in
the Sunday'School," wasfullof truths
and very edifying.
Rev. S. L Piercy, of Taylor county,
delivered a most captivating discourse,
his subject being "World Wide Evan
gelism." Eevs. W. R. Wagoner, Jesse L
Murrell and M. M. Murrell made very
entertaining addresses.
Prof E. R. Moss, one of the princi
pals of the Lindsey-Wilson, made a
splendid talk, his subject being "My
Experience and Contact with Young
Life."
Prof Paul Chandler spoke on what
the Lindsey-Wilson is to Columbia
district and adjacent territory. His
remarks were well received.
We have not the space to take up
the entire program, but it wasgood
from start to finish-.
Mr. Ed Hill, of Campbellsville, who
takes great interest in church work,
was present the first two days, and on
Friday morning made a very gratify
ing talk on "Tithing."
Rev. W. F. Hogard, Wo isvery
much loved, and who was formerly
the Presiding Elder, was present, and it
goes without saying that he was con
tinuously handing out pointers, keep
ing the Conference in fine spirits. He
is now the Presiding Elder of the
Elizabethtown district, and those who
know him know that he will have a
good report when the Loutaville Con
ference meets this fall.
The people of Jamestown and vi
cinity open the doors of their res
idences, threw the keys in the1 well,
and all in attendance had nothing to
do at the meal hours but walk in and
be helped to the best edibles the coun
try afforded. !

Announcement.-
This is to announce that- Rev. Jo

Columbia District of United Brethren
.Kentucky Conference, to take the
place of llev. U. a. west, who is no
longer in that position,
G. M. Mathews,
Bishop of the Central District of the
United Brethren Church.
Mr. Matthew Taylor, who is in his
eightieth year, was in Columbia last
Friday There is not a man in Adair
county who is more universally re
spected, nor one who has more friends.
Thirty years ago 'he was anactive bus
iness man, filling positions in the
county, making a most efficient officer.
To-day carrying the weight of many
years, Buffering with some bodily afflic
tions, he has a smile for every person
he meets, and when he takes your
hand he grips it with a warmth,
which manifests that he is glad to
come in contact with his associates of
early days. He is as gentle as a wom
an, but firm in his convictions. The
writer has known him for many years,
and never at any time has he discov
ered in him any thing but marks of a
true Kentucky citizen. He is a man
who has kept posted with the current
events, and imparts his knowledge to
less informed friends in most enter
taining manner, he is a blessing to his
neighborhood, and a friend well wor
thy of meeting.

For the summ.g months I will not
be'in my office only public days, but
will visit the homes over the county to
look after the Interest of your eyes. I
do this for the benefit of th older
people who seldom come to town.

Rain Kept Many at Home.
Eain prevented a great many from
attending children's exercises at the
Christian church last Sunday night.
However, the interesting program was
carfie'd out, and those who put in an
appearance were delighted. It takes
nerve for little tots to stand before
an audience, recite, march and sing,
but the little girls and boys who ap
peared on this occasion, rendered his
or her part faultlessly. Miss Mary
Lucy Lowe drilled the children and
the way each one performed evidenced
good instruction. The' altar was
beautifully decorated with daises,
giving it a happy spring appearance.
An Estimable Lady Dies.
Last Saturday night Mrs Sallie
Walkup, who was the devoted wife of
Mr. H. K. Walkup, died at her home,
near Glenville. She was a victim of
pulmonary trouble, had been confined
to her room many weeks. She was
about sixty-five years old, and had
been a zealous Christian woman from
early girlhood Her death is a seri
ous blow to her husband and children
and she will be greatly missed by the
entire neighborhood.
A large circle of relatives and
friends attended the funeral and buri
al.
May God comfort the husband and
children in this hour of their greatest
sorrow.
