Coliseum, St. Louis, June 1 1. Seven
teen continuous minutes of fervid, per
juring enthusiasm, flag waving and
singing started off the democratic nn
tUmtil convention here today. It was
'Aiarfir. K. Glynn's rousing laudation
not by name, but by unmistakable ref
erence of President Wilson that gave
ti e rrnioci'ats au opportunity to blow
o-'f steam a little.
The convention was half an liour in
-r-seioHing and started off rather quiet
ly. Vx-Govornor Glynn 's heart-to-heart
nU-le of oratory took his audience's

The audience liked this style of par

Official Notification of Hughes

By Carl D. Groat
(T'uited Tress staff correspondent)
New York, June 14. I the old
guard thinks it can get hold of the
machinery of the republican organiza-1
tion and conduct the campaign, of
Charles Kvan Hughes to suit itself, it
would best watch out for bumps.
('lose personal friends of the candi
date have let it be known tiiat Hughes
will insist on having the major say in
the personnel of the campaign manag
ers and in the conduct of the cam
paign. He will strive to give all its
actions a vitality which will attract
the vote of the progressives. There is
a feeling at headquarters that should
the grand old guardsters ot the Mur
ray Crane, Boise I'enrose, Heed Smoot
type apN;ar to have control of the
campaign, t.ie progressive vote should
be very coy.
On the other hand, the Hughes per
sonal camp believes that even the most
case-hardened srtindpatlers will be
willing to pitch in and. work for
Hughes, even if the old guard leaders
are placed, so far as the public eye is
concerned, on the sidelines.
Would Tlx Hughes Speech '
W. Murray Craio, of the republican
"big three" had a long conference
with Huglies last night and is still in
town today, perhaps for further word.
The date for the conference of Hughes
with the subcommittee of the nation
al committee that is nameless but thnt
actually is a ca,maign "steering corn
tee" has not been definitely fixed.
The conference will probably take
place within a few days. The com
mittee will probably learn that it is a
" steering committee" alright enough
but. that Hugiies is the helmsman.
Former1 notification of Hughes of
his candidacy has been delated and
probably will not taliTT place until early
in July. Jn this the hand of the old
guard is seen. The delny will give the
old guardsters much chance for coun
sel with Hughes, in which they can
urge upon him their ideas to be incor
porated in his formal speech of accept
ance. Hughes plans to detail his ideas
in that seecli and the guardsters arc
anxious that the details be right.
Hughes said he had nothing to say
when he was asked to make known the
police he would pursue in the present !

STRONGLY AGAINST IT

By Lowell Mollett.
(United-Press stuff correspondent.)
St. Louis, Mo., June 14. The demo
cratic platform will contain u strong
direc; bid to the so-called ""fatherless"
progressives or there'll be a fight
This was made clear today as tha
young and progressive members of th
nart.' begun getting together. A com
pact group led by Director of tho Mint
Wooley, Assistuut Attorney ttenera-t
Houston Thompson and Kicnaru i.ioyu
Jones, of Wisconsin, having started
things humming lust night, kept it up
with the avowed purpose of getting ae-
tion.
With the arrival of Secrotary of War
Baker and a pronouncement by him on
the mbject, no doubt was left that thu
proposition to throw the doorg wid
open to progressives will havo strong
buek'u.g before the resolutions commit
tee. Maker, however, was dubious con
cerning the wisdom of "inviting" pro
gressives into the party, a plan that bus
gained a good deal of Jioadway prior to.
his arrival. He would not iudicuto
who her any of the Wilson endorsed
platform planks that ho brought with
him from Washington bear on tho ques
tion of winning tho proijrosslvo support.
"There couldn't be any direct in
vitation," ho said. "We can only hopo
to get progressive support by draw
ing u platform so that it will meet
with their approval."
Kern Favors It.
Senator Kern, democratic lender in
the senate, could seo no objection, be
said, to offering a specific invitation
by platform planks. "It should be
directedt" ho said, "to those progrcs
sjvtM wHio endorsed jtbe progecwniM
achievements of the present administra
tion rnd tho progressive program er.
tinci.il ed in the platform adopted here.
Secretary Daniels declared his en
thusiastic support of tiny "practical
plan" to prove, to progressives that tha
democratic party offers that which tha
progressives lire seeking. The extreme
to which Daniels might be willing to
go was indicated by a series of confer
ences with radicals of various shades,
including support for women suffrage,
llo talked with the suffragists them
selves, but his sessions with democratic
lenders who favor suffrage were regard
ed a more significant.
"Can they deliver what they prem
ies!" the question attributed to Daniels
by nn) who urged administration bark
ing for the plan to give the suffragist
the j.lank endorsing the federal amend
ment for suffrage.
" Vhat they promise, is a strong
working organization in the suffrage
states in behalf of the democratic can
did ites. The women of tho Congres
sional Union have offered to turn their
whole working force over to the demo
crat!', organization if the present con
gress will put the federal amendment
resolution through. The organisation is
bucked bv the 300,000 campaign fund
guaranteed by Mrs. O. II. P. Belmont.
Tsggart Opposes Plan.
Tii" opposition to the plan to garner
progressive votes is quite tangible. Tom
Tnggurt is probably 'frankent among;
the opponents. Having staved off action
by the national committee thin far, he
is insistent "there is nothing to this
progressive business." Certain south
