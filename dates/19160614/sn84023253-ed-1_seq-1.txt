Baccalaureate Sermon
The sermon to the graduating class
was delivered in the chapel Sunday
afternoon at 2.30, with a good at
tendance. The program was as fol
lows: Processional march, by Miss Mildred
Smith, during which the 76 members
of the graduating class entered, led
by the marshal, Edward Walter and
were seated. Invocation and Lord's
prayer followed, by the Rev. J. C.
Stephenson, after which there was
reading from scripture by Rev. J. J.
Hutchinson; singing, "O Rest in the
Lord," by the Boys' and Girls' Glee
clubs followed, and Rev. Harold H.
Niles prayed. The concluding num
ber before the sermon was another se
lection by the glee clubs, "But the
Lord is Mindful of His Own."
The sermon, "The Gospel of Margins"
by Rev. Paul D. Moody of the South
church, St. Johnsbury. Mr. Moody's
text was found in Matthew V:41,
"And whosoever shall compel you to
go with him a mile, go with him
twain." His sermon was an original
plea for "margins" in everything, for
a plane of living which should mean
not only doing just what is required
but a little more; a plea to allow in
planning for sufficient money, time,
work, conduct, not to see how little,
but how much we need do and give.
And the crux of the sermon lay in
the truth that only by the aid of
Christ can this be accomplished. At
the close of the sermon the chorus
sang "Lead, Kindly Light." The
benediction was offered by Rev.
Charles E. Gould and the audience
remained seated while the students
marched out.
HARLEY-DAVIDSONS WON
In Annual Motorcycle Endurance Race
From Worcester to Line and
Return Goes Through St.
Johnsbury.
The fifth annual 24-hour endur

club went through St. Johnsbury ear
ly Sunday morning. It was expected
that 150 motorcyclists would take
part in this 475-mile test from Wor

bad weather of the past week only 60
started. Twenty-eight out of the 60

on the return trip to Worcester suc
cessfully. Walter Coes, son of the Worcester
wrench manufacturer, took a bad skid

Avenue House.
The contest was run under the
rules and sanction of the American
Federation of Motorcyclists of which
M. E. Counsell, a prominent local
dealer, is state commissioner.
Mr. Counsel checked the riders as
they passed through St. Johnsbury on
the return. .The run was won by two
Harley-Davidsons with side cars, the
riders being Messrs. Clifft and "Hap"

ST. J.A. CONCERT
GREATSUCCESS
School Chorus and Orchestra Rend
ered 'The Holy City" Tuesday
Evening
STUDENTSHOLD PARADE
Annual Bon Fire and Frolic Peace
Masque Wednesday Morning
Hon. Bourke Cockran Speaks at
the Colonial Theatre Thurs
day Morning.
The annual commencement concert
given by the Academy chorus, Glee
clubs and orchestra, was held in the
South Congregational church last eve
ning before a large and appreciative
audience. The sacred cantata "The
Holy City." by Alfred K. Gaul, was
presented by the chorus and orches
tra, assisted by Mrs. Minnie L. Sam
ple of Springfield, Mass., soprano;
Miss Ruth Flint, contralto; Roy Cald
erwood, tenor, and Georgs R. Bollin
ger, bass. From the introduction to
the final full chorus the audience was
held in rapt attention.
"The Holy City" has long been a
favorite cantata. Up to last evening it
was not as well known to St. Johns
bury audiences as some other less
deserving music. The public should,
and doubtless will, appreciate the
splendid effort put forth by those who
took part in the concert, and render
ed so creditably the beautiful and in
spiirng strains of the cantata.
The chorus attempted the bold and
difficult part with fervor and strength.
In the strains of the chorus "Holy,
Holy, Holy," it Improved the oppor
tunity to show hhat a large chorus can
successfully do in tones that softly and
sweetly portray the full meaning of
the words. Great strength and ma
jesty were revealed In the principal
choruses, "Thine is the Kingdom,"
and the last chorus, "Great and Mar
vellous." These were deservedly and
enthusiastically applauded. The solo
isis were all most cordially received by
the large audience that filled the
church.
Tribute to Local Soloists
To the local soloists a word or trib
ute can heartily be bestowed. Mr.
Calderwood is possessed of a true ten
or voice. His part was very well tak
en. He doubtless will be better
known as his voice Is developed by
such tests as he successfully met last
evening. Mr. Bollinger has a rich
bass voice and delighted his many
friends by successfully, and in fine
spirit, manipulating the difficult por
tions of the several fine solos, both
alone and accompanied by the cho
rus. Miss Flint took her several so
los in a manner that revealed the rich
quality of her voice. Her solos were
enthusiastically received and finely
rendered.' Mrs. Sample, who sang the
difficult soprano solos, charmed one
and all by the clearness of her bird
like tones and sympathetic rendering
with technique and phrasing most
pleasing. Her voice thrilled her au
dience as with ease she mastered the
high and difficult part assigned to the
soprano. It caused real regret that
the composer did not add more so
prano arias to this beautiful cantata.
All will have enjoyed hearing Mrs.
Sample sing more selections. St.
Johnsbury audiences will gladly wel
come any future opportunities of
hearing her sing.
Fine Accompaniments
The accompaniment by the orches
tra, as drilled by Miss Peck, the piano,
as played by Miss McGilliveray, and
the organ as presided over by Mrs.
Joseph Fairbanks, proved that hard
work is rewarded. The audience duly
recognized all things, the concert, the
constant task so successfully perform
ed by those who accompany a chorus
in a cantata full of difficult yet most
beautiful parts. Miss Peck certainly
has won deserved praise for the
faithful work she has done for this
section of Vermont. The Academy or
chestra is certainly one to be proud of
and Miss Peck is to be most heartily
congratulated for the satisfactory and
unusual musical results obtained. To
Miss Brownell was accorded at the
close of the concert an applouse that
indicated how well and faithfully she
had performed her task as musical
instructor in our public schools and
Academy. Some have realized the
vast amount of hard work she has
done. It is safe to say that after last
night's most successful performance
that many will realize as never before
the extreme value of music in our
educational system.

Students' Annual Frolic.
The students of St. Johnsbury Acad
emy held their annual frolic and bon
fire last evening In front of the dor
mitories and administration buildings.
The streets were illuminated with hun
dreds of electric lights to better assist
them in the annual "blow out" that
wound up with a night-shirt parade.
The parade was late in starting due to
lack of torches for the illumination of
the band which was right on hand
with the popular music, getting the
crowd lining the sidewalks with "Are
You from Dixie?" with several hun
dred voices in on the chorus.
Of the many negligee costumes on
the boys' end of the line there were
night shirts, pajamas, blazers and ev
ery description of night clothing.
Some even dared to appear with noth
ing on other than a smile and a union
suit. The young ladles were more
modest in their tastes and were va
riously arrayed in sheets, turbans and
flowing robes. They showed con
tempt of the duties of the past year
by bearing the signs, "Goodnight
Caesar," and "Virgil is no more."
The parade, led by the band, parad
ed down Eastern avenue onto Railroad
street and back, where they more or
less quietly dispersed.
Baccalaureate Sermon
The North church was filled Sunday
evening with those anxious to hear the
baccalaureate sermon to the gradu
ating class of St. Johnsbury Acad
emy, given by Rev. Dr. Edward
T. Fairbanks. It was an in
spiring address, full af pertinent il
lustrations both from life and from
books, and also contained tributes to
the first principal of the Academy and
its founder, Sir Thaddeus Fairbanks.
The pulpit was banked with wild
flowers and the Academy Glee clubs
gave two anthems, "The Earth Is the
Lord's" by Brown, and "I Will Mag
nify Thee," by Mosenthal-Klein. The
invocation was given by Rev. Clar
ence L. Eaton, Rev. F. S. Tolman of
fered the prayer and the closing
prayer and benediction were given by
Rev. Paul D. Moody.
Dr. Fairbanks took his text from
Hosea 14:5, "He shall grow as the lily,
and cast forth his roots like Leban
on," and the cedars of Lebanon and
the lily were used as a theme for his
address.
The opening function of commence
ment week at St. Johnsbury Academy
was helu Friday evening when Prln.
and Mrs. M. G. Benedict gave a re
ception to the members of the sen
ior class, their parents and friends.
There was a large attendance, the
graduating class being a large one,
and several outside of their families
being present.
In the receiving line were Princi
pal and Mrs. Benedict and Horace
Massey president of the class, and
Miss Dorothy Adams, vice-president.
As soon as all had arrived Princi
pal Benedict announced a selection
by the Academy Glee clubs, which
was followed by a violin solo by Miss
Marjorie Cramton with Eunice Mc
Gillivray at the piano. Miss Cramton
played a delightful violin solo, a Ber
ceuse by Jarnefelt. As always Miss
Cramton's playing showed excellent
technique and remarkable control of
her Instrument. Her tone was full
and sweet. Miss Cramton is a very
gifted violinist . and it is always a
great pleasure to hear her play. Mrs.
F. A. Eldrldge of Springfield, Mass.,
prestlgitator, gave some very
amusing sleight of hand acts. At the
close of the program refreshments
were served.

THE VALVE MEN DINE
Abolition of Dcixirtiiient at Fairbanks
Will Not Separate Men and Plan
Is To Make It Annual Affair.
About 50 employees of the valve de
partment of the E. and T. Fairbanks
& Co. factory gathered at Sherburne's
Saturday night for a get-together din
ner. The valve business which has
been located here for the past 19
years was recently sold to The Fair
banks Co., of Blnghamton, N. Y., and
hereafter will be continued in that
city,
Some of the men employed in this
department may go to Blnghamton,
but the local company has so much
work in the scale department it de
sires to find places for all heretofore
employed in the manufacture of
valves.
Most of those present at the dinner
had worked side by side for a number
of years.
Just a little before 10 o'clock "the
valvles" assembled and proceeded to
do full justice tothe repast provided
by Mine Host Sherburne.
After the last strawberry and bit of
cake had disappeared the smokes were
started going and the remainder of
the evening was spent in the regula
tion manner. Impromptu speeches, ex.
changing of reminiscences and a gen
eral good time, and it was not until
"the witching hour" that the assembly
broke up, each one declaring it to
have been the most enjoyable one of
its kind they had ever attended.
After the spread there were re
marks made by D. R. Cole, foreman
of the department, who spoke of the
job and his association with it. There
were also remarks by A. E. Marshall,
F. J. Doloff, C. R. Jenkins. 11. J. Jun
eau, W. W. Morse and Albert Moore.
The committee in charge consisted
of Messrs. G. C. Currier, A. J. Cum
mings and C. I. Grant who certainly
did their part in a way that left
nothing to be desired, while the ef
ficient service rendered by the Sher
burne forces made the whole Affair
pass off with entire satisfaction to all.
