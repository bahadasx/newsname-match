in which It is thought fit and
proper for a careless and Ignorant par
ent to bind his children for life in the
bonds of ignorance, blind them for life
to the light of knowledge, and crip
ple them for life In the struggle for
existence; and this fact is a blot upon
our boasted civilization, a blot we
should like to enlist every man, wom
an and child In our Progressive Farm
er family in helping to wipe out. '
The argument of "personal liberty,"
the rights of the parent etc., which
have been ao long Invoked In this mat
ter cannot stand the light of reason.
What about the "rights of the child"
and his own God-given right of "lib
erty" of mind through the emancipat
ing power of knowledge? And as for
the parent, we may well say In the
language of the great philosopher Hux
ley: "I have liberty to do right; I
will thank any man to take away my
right to do wrong. The right to keep
a child In Ignorance Is "a right to do
wrong," and It should be taken away
from every careless parent In the
South, aa it has already been taken
away from such parents nearly every
where else outside of heathendom.

The scholarship contest Inaugurated '
by the Womans Club of this city,
which gives free scholarships at the
A. & M. College short course this sum
mer, closes Friday, June SO.
An unusual interest has been mani
fested in this contest from its very
beginning, there being about forty
names -e'nrolled upon the list and.
many others came in later. 'It has
already proven a benefit to all, for it
has aroused a greater Interest in the
art of home canning, home gardening
and the care of poultry. All cannot
win the scholarships, offered as prizes,
but aft shave In the benefits derived
from competing for them, and this
benefit Is not confined to that in
dividual alone but' to the members of .
her home, her neighborhood and coun
ty as well.
Mrs.' Albert Duchsnan. the retiring
president Is still in charge of this
stbolarshlp contest, as It is a continu
ation of this year's work of the club.
All committees to arrange for the
success of the closing day, June 30, ,
will be announced next week, and all
contestants are reminded to watch
The Eagle for the program of the day,
and other important announcements.
This work as undertaken by the
women of our town and county Is a
worthy one, and one from which only
good and real benefit to all can be
derived, and It Is hoped that the peo
ple of Bryan will Join with the tire
less, faithful women of the Woman's '
Club In making the closing day, Fri
