TO CARRANZA
Wilson to Deny De?

the First Chief.
CAPITAL FEARS
RESULT OF NOTE
Steps Taken by Adminis?
tration Officials to Meet
Any Emergency.
irrrm T*. MM ? ? ttaOM I
Wa-hington, June IS. The final draft
of the note to Mexico wai completed
to-day and will br lubmitted to rresi
drnt Wilson to-morrow. lt will not br
sent at once, hut will be held up until
the Democratic convention has ad
journed.
The note will reject flatly Carranza's
demand for the withdrawa! of the
American forces, and will g;ve only
partial satisfaetion to his demand for
an explanation of the purposes of the
expedition. Carranza will br rebuked
for what thr Administration considers
imprrtinent observntions on its mo
tives in Mexico, and certain statements
of fact in the Carranra note will be
disputed vigorously.
Offlcials fear that the note will in
flame public sentiment in Mexico fur?
ther, with an open break between thr
two governments as the possible out
comr Prrssure is already strong on
Carranza to oppose the American expe?
dition by arms, and hr may be obliged
to yield to the inerca-wd demand ex?
pected to follow the American notr.
Thr principal argumrnt of the Ad
mlnietration is that ( arranz-. has failed
'.n demnnstrate his control of the ban
dit infrsted area in (hihuahua, aa
shown by the rrpented raids into Amer
ican territory. The expedition will re?
main, therefore, until this situation
improvrs.
Nothing DoM hy ( arranza.
The SUte Iiepartment understands
that General (ibregon promised Gen
eral Scott ?n effective pntrol of the
border and a relontleai can
against the handits. Instead of this, it
is alleged, the Mexiean government has
done nothing except send tTOOBfl tfl
watch the I'ershing expedition,
the bandits have been allowod to roam
over the country and invadi I
States unmolcsted. lt is deciared that
if thr Carranza government had cooper
ated the expedition wnubl, have aeen
withdrawn long ago.
The Cairanza government insii-ts
that General Obregon made no such
promise. He fuggested, it contendr, a
mutual patrol of thr bordrr, and ob
tainrd a promisr from (ieneral Scott
that no more troops would be gent into
Mexico, which promise was violated by
the Glcnn Springs expedition and the
later pur.-,uits across the boundary.
It is apparrnt that the Scott-Obre
gon conferrnce producrd only delay
and misunderstandings. The two gov?
ernments are entirely at odds as to
what agrcement was reaehed.
Announcement that the i'a
note would be answered in detail wa

1 "Iny, the New Jersey Progressive
leader.
Theodore Douglas Robinson, nephew
of Colonel Roosevelt and former chair?
man of the New York State PrOf*rflSfliTfl
e ommittee, also called on Mr. Hughes
to pledge his support, and soon after
Osear S. Straus, a delegate-at-large to
the Progressive National Convention,
announced that he would also ally him?
self with the former associate justice.

Mr. Hughes had a two hours' con?

man of the National Republiean Com?
mittee, and all the officer. and em
ployes of the eampaign headquarters
throughout the country.
Af'er it was over Governor Hughes1
said he had nothing to say, hut Mr.
Crane took occasion to deny a Chicago
dispatrh which eredited the "old
guard" with trying to retain a hold on
the national organization through the
appointlve power of the sub-commit
tee.
"There will be no appointments
made by the sub-committee until after
Mr. Hughes has been ronsulted. Mr.
Hughes and myself talked over the
situation and discussed those eligihle
for the two big positions to be ti 1 led.
that of national chairman and eam?
paign manager, but anything on that
score must come from Mr. Hughes."
Hughes'. Klection Predirted.
Nieholas Murray Butler, president of
e'olumbia I'niversity, who placed Klihu
Root in nomination at the Chicago con?
vention, also vialtfld Mr. Hughes. Later
Dr. Butler .aid:
"There la not the slightest doubt that
Hughes will be elected, and he will re
ceive a .urpristngly large vote from
the Democrats, and praetieally the en?
tire Progressive vote. I am .atistied to
have him aa leader, and he will make a

Thii was the opinion of all who called

that his attitude in the eampaign would

Mr. Hughei dropped the smile ?

U. S. AMENDMENT
FAVORED IN NEW
SUFFRAGE PLANK
Daniels and Other Leading
Democrats Submit Plan
to Women.
St. Louis, June lt. Suffrage leaders
to-night received for approval a ten
tative draft of a suffrage plank for the
Pemocratie platform drawn by Secre?
tary Daniels and other leading Demo?
crat* The plank deelarrs unequivocal
ly for the passage by Congress of a
suffrage amendment to the Constitu
tion.
Leaders of thr woman's party im
mrdiately approved the form of thi
plank. Their contention, however, ha?
been that Congress should par-s thi
Susan B. Anthony amendment without
dclay, and their leaders are exprctrd
to press for such action. Thr plank,
it is believrd, will be ratisfactory to
the National American Woman Surfrag
.ition, which has been contend
ing only for an indorsement of suf?
frage.
The proposed plank follows:
"The Constitutlon providej that
when any considerable number of peo?
ple desire to have an issue refrrrrd
to the people thr Congress may sub?
mit the constitutional amendment to
the legislatures of the separate states
for ratirication.
I'cniand Kccogoijed.
"Now that there are more than ??-,
nn.i.hmi women voters in the country
and the issue has been ratitied by th,*
legislative action of twelvi separate
states, and, as there is a rrcognucd
.? .1 for rqual suffrage among a
large number of citizens, wr favor the
passage by the Congress of a Federal
imendment to the Constitution, grant
ing the right of suffrage to women. in
order that the separate states may,
by legislative act, decide whether thry
wish such amendment adopted."
Joy f-.Iled the suffrage camps here to
light because to-day Secretary of the
S'avy Daniels publicly indorsed the
>qual rights movement, and on every
.and suffragisls deciared they believed
he Democratic platform would favor
:hrir cause.
The Secretary made it plain that he
ipoke only as an individual, but auf
ragists believed his words might have
nfluence with the resolutlons commit
ee when it passes M thi proposed suf
rage plank of the platform.
?*I beheve," Mr Daniels said, "that
4-omen should have equal rights with
nen. In so far as I can help you as an
ndrvidual I will. I am not speaking
or any one except myself. however.
