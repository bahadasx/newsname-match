' Marshall anil victory In November
was the program of the delegates
who crowded Into the big Coliseum
here today for the opening session
of the Democratic national convention.
There probably was not* one.
I Democrat who went Into the building*
who could recall when a national
| convention of lhat party entered upj
on its work with more hurmony than
I that which prevailed among the more
than 1,000 delegates today. The
candidates for president and vice
president have been decided upon and
according to the leaders there will
be no friction over the party's declaration
of principles. Only the phraseology
of a few planks of the platform
are to be agreed upon.
Those who looked for clear weather
for the convention were a bit disappointed
to learn that conditions
were uncertain. There was, however,
one thing virtually certain and that
was that It was warm enough to
make the closely packed crowd in the
Coliseum swelter.
Nearly everybody who went to the
convention from the eastern part of
Ft. Louis journeyed by way of Washington
Htreet. which for two hours
before the convention convened was
transferred into a "golden lane." On
either side of the broad avenue stood
woman suffragists arrayed lu yellow.
CIm They stood and sat on stools a few
" feet apart and did not utter a word
to the passing throngs making their
way to the convention hall. The golden
lane stretched for twelve blocks
from the hotel district to the Coliseum
and the mute demonstration was
expected by its originators to Influence
the delegates In the mutter of a
declaration for suffrage.

?At 11:2ft o'clock, gorty minutes
before time for the Democratic national
convention to he called to order.
there were not more than twenty
delegates on the tloor. only a few
officials on the platform and the galleries
were filling slowly. There wao
little excitement and hands furnished
the only amusement for rhe crowd.
Carpenters were heating a tattoo in
finishing touches upon the hall as the
delegates filed in.
The delegates and alternates had
seats on the main floor nrrnnged like
n huge oblong wedge with a broad
side towards the platform. Their
seats were Jammed together, arrangements
for both delegates and spectators
being much more congested than
at. either convention In Chicago. The
only picture of President Wilson was
hung on the speaker's stand. It was
a small reproduction of a photograph
on n shield with a background of tho
tlag and bore the Inscription "America
first."
The Coliseum filled rapidly just befor
nenoon. some delay in opening the
doors to spectators preventing an earlier
influx. The bands accompanied
the delegations to the hall but were
not allowed to march into the hall.
Tew delegations came in altogether
and there was little excitement or
rheering during the half hour preceding
the opening of the convention.

Because of the heat under the
Flaring skylight many of the delegates
removed their coats.
The Texas delegation tossed miniature
souvenir bales of cotton to the
galleries.
At 11:1". the ofllcial hand began
the opening concert In acom pan intent
to a inale quartet which sang a new
pong about America through megaphones.
The song brought the first
applause of the day.
In calling the convention to order
at noon today Chairman William F.
v * McCombn of the Democratic National
Committee, spoke as follows:
"We are in an atmosphere of victory.
We have no feeling of guess,
but a spirit of certainty. We meet
to celebrate the marvelous achievements
of the. Democratic party since
It came into power and to place a

It promises the country in the main,
what the Democratic party has al- i

saving always, the bogus (2nd

with a judicial robe hut the

"The board of directors has sat In
Chicago and again resolved that they
are the country. They have adopted
the doctrine of fore ordination and
predestination, but have made It applicable
only to themselves.
"The rest of the people are their

"Ambition is a noble attribute but
when it is adulterated with greed, aj

"We have witnessed the drab spectacle
of two groups of men. trading
principles like competitors in a fish

would win public support.
They have not come together they
have fallen out over the "swag." For;

Their leader has abandoned them
with crass cruelty.
"The gentleman from Oyster Bay
in a recent letter to Chicago quotes j
Abraham IJncoin as saying 'May not

in a common effort to save our common

but that war only exists between

of reuniting Americans? No. Americans
