St. Louis, . IVJo., June 14. For the
first time in a decade, Democracy's
hosts met in quadrlonniul session to
day with complete agreement on the
choice of national standard bearer.
There wasn't a delegate) who didn't
nsree to the reiioniinatiou of Presi
dent Wood row Wilson.
The bitterness of the factional strife
at Baltimore four years ago was gone.
Advance indications were for a regu
lar "love feast" with the only possibil
ities for any difference of opinion
present in the building of a platform.
It was a cheerful, optimistic, cheer
lug anil confidant throng that respond,
cil to the bang of .National Chairman
William F. McComb's gavel. No .spec
ter or an internecine iignr miriiueu.
First of aB, the delegates were meet
ing in Missouri, one ot whose lavorue
sons four years ago was a defeated
candidate ill the buttle of the ballots.
That same favorite son Speaker
Champ Clarkt aa if to emphasize Un
healing of the wounds dealt him by
the Baltimore gathering, was one of
the loudest in his praises of the men
who took from him the- honor of lead
ing the Democratic hosts.
"I believe the convention can ad
journ by Friday, if it so desires,"
Chairman McCombs said just before
convening the assembly.
The delegates themselves, however.
Indicated early in the meeting their
desire to hiar "glorification" speech
es and this 'excess of enthusiasm was
expected to prolong the convention un
til Saturday morning.
St. Louis began playing tne host to
the visiHug -thousands in royal fash
ion. Non-partisan committees galore,
whose interest and energy was bent
solely toward making visitors com
fortable and Jrappy,' were constantly
in attendani';::: . ti- '
The convention is St. Louis' first
chance since the Txiuisiana Purchase
Kxposition of r.ui4 to entertain distin
guished guests, and St. Louisans were
determined to make the occasion a
memorable one.
The convention hall itself had been
repainted throughout, mostly with
white paint so that everv possible bit
of light was reflected into its gigantic
interior.
Special ventilating apparatus cooled
the sultry' air, JV'lcgates and niter-
nates alone were permitted on the
ground floor, permitting more com
fortable seating space for the men who
actually do the convention work.
One topic which was eagerly (Hh.
cussed by the crowds in the streets
and hotel lobbies was the so-called
"unit rule" and "two thirds" regula
tion which from time immemorial has
ruled Democratic conclaves,
t There was general belief expressed
that the usual quadriennlal attempt
to overthrow these ancient rules would
succeed this year.
Delegates recalled that the attempt
wns made four years ago in Baltimore
and defeated mainly because there was
such bitter' strife between tho candi
dates. If the two-thirds rule had not

Crippled and Reports Meagre;
Light Plant in Trouble
Following the hottwt day of the
present season, a severe wind storm
swept Chickasha, striking the city at
U:;!U this morning, accompanied by a
heavy downpour of rain.
While no houses were blown down
in the city, the destruction to glass
was considerable and meager reports
received from rural, eomnHintis state,
that corn lias been blown flat, and
wheat yet uncut badly fallen. The
damage to the corn, however, is not
considered serious as the stalks were
not sufficiently matured to break from
the force of the wind and will, it is
thought, straighten up.'
Agricultural Agent Cooper said that
he had been trying all morning to get
in communication with farming com
munities over the telephone, but ow
ing to wire trouble was unable to do
so.
On Chickasha avenue several win
dows wero blown out in the second
story of the Dugan building, between
Fourth and Fifth streets; a number of
windows were smashed at the United
States recruiting station and in the
Fagle's hall in tne Diiggers building
at the corner of Chickasha avenue and
Second street while the large plate
glass windows at the Grady County
Commercial and Farm bureau were
t
smashed.
A largo burn, just completed, belong
ing to J. C. White, near Bradley, had
been unroofed and badly damaged.
The Buck Island reported all early
morning trains operating on timo with
(he exception of the train from Kl Ue
no to Manguiu which was reported
l three hours late out of Kl Iteuo on ac
count of delayed connections from the
north caused through washouts, it was
thought, in Kansas, which happened
after the Firefly had run this morn
ing. The Frisco reports no further dam
age along its lines and the Santa Fe
states that all lines are in shape, with
trains running on schedule.
The Western Union Telegraph com
pany reports connections to the north
good and the Dallas wire working but
weak.
The Portal telegraph lines are re
ported all working out of Oklahoma
City both ways with connections out
of Chickasha unimpaired.
The Pioneer Telephone company re
ported numerous city phones out of
commission wiln ten rural and long
distance lines out of commission early
this morning. Trouble "shooters"
were workng hard, however, and the
greater part of the Carnage had been
repaired and practically all the local
phones working by noon.

REHEARING
DENIED IN
PAVE. CASE
A phone message from Judge C. B.
Stewart to Alger Melton received last
night conveyed the news that the state
supreme court hail denied the. applica
tion of the attorneys for the plaintiff
for a. new hearing im.tho matter of
the Cityy of Chickasha vs. Defmis
O'Brien, et al.
The suit, decided against the citi
zens in two hearings before the su
preme court, involves between $;J."0,
1)00 and $100,000, together with inter
est at the rate of 18 per cent since
10 1 2. The payment of the entire pav
ing tax of Chickasha, except the pav
ing tax on Chickasha and Kansas ave
nues was involved in the suit, which
was first tried and decided lor the
plaintiff in the district court, then ap
pealed and reversed, later reheard "and
again adversely decided lo the plain
tiff. . It is understood that the court, in
denying the motion for a rehearing re
affirms its former decision, holding
the 00 clay statute prohibits action of
this kind being maintained.
Attorney Alger Melton, of counsel
for citizens of Chickasha, stated this
morning that he had not received a
copy of the mandate, therefore was
not advised of the exact point upon
which the decision was based, but
that if the opinion was based upon
and the hearing denied on the grounds
that the? ;o day statute prohibits
courts from giving relief he would
probably favor appealing the matter
to the United States supreme court.

County Agent Cooper stated this
morning that the president ot the Free
Comity Fair association, and the mem
hers of the towushlp fair boards are
expecting one of the biggest oventa la
llin i:tate in the (irady county fair,
localizing that the hint fair was re
sponsible for forcing tirady county,

the third and fourth place, in point oC
prominence, at tun Ktatc fair laut fall,
all members of the fair association
hi'ii working hard to make the fair of
the coming fall, bigger and better
than any county fair In the slate and
hope to gather together a group ot

statu fair at. Oklahoma City, will places
Grady county at the toft of the culutttry
as the agricultural and live) utocls
county of the state. 1
Mr. Cooper said that there remalu
ed now 'no cjiiestion of the ogrittultur
al possibilities of (Irady county; that
the interest now manifested In the
breeding of fine cattle and horses and
bogs was fuHt bringing the county to,
the lead in live stock and that the
main thing to fear this fall, when thu
entries are placod on exhibition at the
state fair would not be the keen com
petition of the other counties of th
Male, but. an over-confidence of the
producers of Grady county which,
might lead them to be careless In
getting the very best of the products
' of this county to the front.
Mr. Cooper neid further that ho and
President Helm, of the county fair as
sociation, .were urging upon all tho
great importance of thoae who have
good stuff to begin at once gathering
and paving the best of their products
to be placed upon exhibition here.
They urge all farmers to begin right
now selecting, their "bundle exhib
its." Wheat, soft ud hard; rye, eata
and barley they say should be select
ed without further delay. The far
mers In other counties are now select
ing their choice bundles and thi3 in
itself shows that they are awak to
tho iieeelit ot early action.
Mr. Cooper says that all bundles
should bo carefully selected end huus
from joists In store houses in such a
way that rats and mice may not get
to them or that weather damage may.
not result.
Oi( account of the scarcity of fruit

given out that there will be plenty of
