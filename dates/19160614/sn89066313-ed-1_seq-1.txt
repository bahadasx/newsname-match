to
Trim Columbia's Shade Trees.
Dtcause of the .many complaints
which are being made against the
decision of the m.ior to have Colum
bia's trees trimmed so as to do away
with their interference with the elec
tric wires, Maor J. M. Datterton is
sued a statement today in defense of
iiis stand.
"TJie people of Columbia," the May
or said, "should understand the mo
tive behind this decision to have the
trees trimmed. Interference of the
trees with the electric wires breeds
danger to human life, and it is better
to prevent it now than try to cure it
later. If the citizens will cut their
trees so that there is no interference
with the wires, we will let them alone;
if they do not, we will trim them in
the way we think best for the protec
tion of human life."

ST. LOUIS. June 14 That the

plank inviting the Progressives to join
them or else there will tie a fight in

ST. LOUIS, Mo. Juno 14 For the
first time in decades, Democrac's
heists met in qundricuiii.il session to
da with complete agreement on the
choice of national standard bearer.
There wasn't a delegate who didn't
agree to the renomination of Presi
clcnt Woodrow Wilson.
The bitterness of thc factional
strife at Daltimore four cars ago
was gone. Advance indications were
for a regular "love feast" with thc
onl possibilities for any difference of
opinion present in the building of a
platform.
It was a cheerful, optimistic, cheer
ing and confident throng that re
sponded to the bang of .National
Chairman William F. McCombs' gavel.
Xo specter of an internecine fight in
truded. First of all, thc delegates were
meeting in Missouri, one of whoso fa
vorite sons four ears ago was a de
feated candidate in the battle of the
ballots.
That same favlirite son Speaker
Champ Clark as it to emphasize thc
healing of the wounds dealt him by
thc Daltimore gathering, was one of
thc loudest in his praises of the men
who took from him the honor of lead
ing the Democratic hosts.
