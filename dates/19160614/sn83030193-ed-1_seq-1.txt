half a dozen young women with
megaphones saw to It that, the banner
did not go unnoticed. It wns tho work

President Wilson, who dropped out
of the ranks at tho White Hou-to
where the reviewing stand was o

throughout the put tide and frequently
wavfd his hut to officials he recog

Following an nttnek of lllnes on

wlfo from South America, Col. Roose

Chairman of the National Progressive
Convention in Chicago, nnd Harold
l Ickcs, Progressive Committeeman
t
from Illinois, nt thn Hotel J.sngdon,
Fifth Avcnun and Fifty-fifth Street,
Col. Roosevelt Issued the following
statement:
"Ono vear ago I broke one of my
ribs on tho left side while tiding a
horse. The animal fell and threw
me. The coughing spells which I have 1
had since then have probably strained
one of the ligaments about my heart.
It Is ridiculous but painful, so like
King Agab, I arch mv neck and walk
llghtb."
The Colonel ndmltted, however, that
he would undergo an X-Ray examina
tion to-night, but declared that t
would not Interfere with engagements
he has made for ihe. two or three days
he intends remaining in town
The former President looked like a
very sick man when lie mc Kermit.
He greeted It fa son nnd the l.ltter'.s
wlfo without effusion.
A woman In the Ronsevelt patty
hurried to a telephone on th dock
and cnlled a number, addressing the
party who answered as "Ductoi."
"Col. Roosevelt Is III," sho wns
heard to say, "Tho f.iiulb is worried.
Can you come down?"
Kvldcntly the physician asked what
was thn trouble, for she answered
that Col. Roosevelt "had a stitch in
tho aide." which was causing him
great pain.
A moment later she added "All
right, wo will send him right up."
Col, Roosevelt was put Into the au
tomobile of his son-in-law, Dr. Derby,
nnd started uptown.
When thn throe, automobiles con
veying tho party arnved at Mis
Derbs home, In Kast Seventy-n.ntli
Stleet, Col. Roosevilt was missing. A
man In tho party said: "Mr. Rouse,
vrlt merely strained u muscle near
his heart. Ho was driven to the
olllco of his physician." Tim In
formant declined to tiamo thn pli
slclau. Mrs. Derby saw leporters at hm
homo soon after her arrival
"I do not know where these alarm
ing reports originated," she said, "but
there is no ground for them Mr.
Roosevelt has long been suffering
from a severe cold and has been
coughing quite a bit. This moinlng
lie was seized by one of the coughing
spells and strained a iinibclo about
his heurt Dr. Derby took him to a
nearby physician to have tho tumble
attended to."
Mis. Kermit Ronfivelt, who con
trailed tvplioid fever In Pannma, has
