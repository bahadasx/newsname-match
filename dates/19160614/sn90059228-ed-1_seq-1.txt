BOXVILLE FARMERS CLUB
PICNIC WAS A SUCCESS.

pleasant and successful social affair.

Ruth Peterson gave a select reading
that was very well received, this be
ing followed by more music. Presi
dent Hilleboe then introduced Hon S.
G. Iverson, the speaker of the day.
Mr. Iverson made a splendid address
in which he took occasion to con
gratulate the people of Boxville for
their enterprise and progressive
spirit, their efforts of co-operation
and their success in building up a
prosperous farming community. He
had lived all his life in Minnesota,
but had traveled extensively all over
the union, yet he had seen no state
to compare with Minnesota in agri
cultural resources. The Red River
Vaflley was in fact the richest agri
cultural region in the world. He
feared that we do not all appreciate
what we have here in our soil and
climate. Mr. Iverson made eloquent
allusion to our splendid educational
system, which furnishes equal op
portunities for rich amd poor to ac
quire an education. He commended
the spirit of co-operation between
town and country that was evidenced
at this picnic. The farmer and the
business men should unite and co
operate in building up the communi
ty in which they live. Mr. Iverson
made patriotic reference to the flag
and the blessings of free government
which we here enjoy. His speech
was an eloquent effort and was well
received. The Warren Maile* quar
tette rendered several songs at the
conclusion of the speech.
The remainder of the afternoon
was devoted to sports, among which
were foot races, tug of war, nail
pounding contest and baseball games.
The first ball game was between
the boys of WaiTen and Boxville
and resulted in a score of 8 to 6 in
favor of the Warren lads. Clarence
Spaulding officiated as peace maker
during this contest as he was the
only unbiased base ball fan to be
found on the grounds. Mr Spauld
ing resides in Warren and operates a
modern farm in Boxville.
The second ball game '-vas between
Boxville and McCrea. This contest
resulted in a score of 11 to 1
inand
favor of the Boxville aggregation.

Warren 2 Red Lake Falls 4.
In a fast and interesting contest
Red Lake Falls trimmed up the
local collection of ball players by a
score of 4 to 2, Wednesday evening
last week, on the home diamond. Del
burn, an ex-Northerni leaguer heaved
for the visiting nine and struck out
20 men. Halbert was in the box for
Warren and threw a godd game se
curing 12 strike outs but was given
rather poor support by his fellow
team mates.
Warren 5 Stephen 4.
In a game with little or no "pep"
the Warren nine took the home pro
duct team of Stephen into camp Fri
day evening on the Warren diamond,
to a tune of 5 to 4. Considering the
fact that the Stephen nine is com
posed entirely of home talent and
that this was their second game of
the season, they put up a good game
of ball. "Chuck" Russell was on the
round for Warren and struck out 11
men. Jack Walker received and
backed up the twirler in great style.
oSwanson heaved for the visitors and
secured 5 strike outs. Bouvette
played on the receiving end for the
Stephenites.
The features of the game were a
home run by Bouvette of Stephen
and three base hits by Herringer of
Warren and Rusling of Stephen.
