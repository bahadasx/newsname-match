' London, June 14. Kovel, next to
Lemberg the most important railroad
center back of the eastern Austrian
line, is now, with (Lemberg and Cser

drive. Its capture would provoke a
serious embarrassment to the lines
of the Germans toward Riga and
those of the Austrtana to the south.
The Russians' : have approached
Kovel olosest in the terrttory west of
Lutsk. Further Indentation of the
Austrian line here would give them
an opportunity to gain their objec

Democracy's representatives never
met under such Ideal conditions as
they did hero today. First of all, the
party of Jefferson and Jackson was
unanimous In Its choice of candidates
for tha national ticket; there was
complete accord on the platform on
which those candidstee were to ap
peal to the public and fullest agree
ment on the program.
At 11 o'clock, when workmen were
still tacking up decorations and look-
lag to see that th(ss tsr ship-shape,
the spectator; sod delegate? began
arriving. j ,..;: ,.;v,;

can flag, while on every seat was a
slfp with the verses of the "Star
Spangled banner" printed thereon.
The crowd was slow in straggling la,
due to the multiplicity of attractions
without the suffragettes, garbed la
snowy white and yellow gold dresses;
beads that gave Impromptu concerts
and Interest la the arrival of the cele
brities.':': f; ; .
Bryan's n trance to ths press stands
touched off a' great explosion of noise.
The commoner had wandered In, his
press ticket In one hand and a big
Japanese fan In the other, and was
looking uncertainly for his seat when
the crowd glimpsed him. He smiled
at the ovation, shook hands with
some of his newspaper colleagues and
then sat down. . ,

LIOOSEBS IH PLANK OF PLATFOntl
8t. Louis, June 14. The demo-
cratlc platform will contain a strong
direct bid to the totalled "father
less" progressive or there will be
a tight.;. . .
This wss made ilear today as tha
young and progressive members of
the democratic party began getting
together. A compact group, led by
Director of the Mint , Wooley and
Richard Lloyd Jones of Wisconsin,
started things humming last night,
and kept it up with tha avowed pur
pose of getting direct action.
With the arrival of Secretary of
War Baker and a pronouncement by
him on the subject, no doubt was left
on the subject that tbe attempt to
throw Jhe doors wide open to the
moosers will have strong backlng'by
the resolutions committee.
Baker, however, was dubious: of
the wisdom of Inviting the progres
sives, into the party, a plsn that has
gained a good deal of headway prior
to hie arrival. (He would not indi
cate whether any ; of the Wilson
endorsed platform planks that he
brought with him from Washington
bear on tha question of winning the
progressive support. . , ,i v , -j
"There could not be any direct in
vitation," he said. "We can only
hope to got progressive support by
drawing a platform , so that . It will
meet with their approval."' ..' ,,, ,

the aenate, could t4 ho otrieotton.
ly rounded bit of applause greeted
introduction of former Governor
Martla H. Glynn of New York tem
porary chairman, i
Glynn's first thought that struck
the audience and brought forth a
spark of enthusiasm was his defense
of the Wilson Americanism, and his
characterisation of the Americanism
of others as "pepper pot" politicians.
' At this time a summer rain had
set in ootaido and tha skylight was
fully needed to lighten things np.
The heat was sticky and enervating
and was shown In the absence of any
spontaneity la the applause until vol
anteer cheer leaders on the platform
i?t busy and literally pulled It out
with waving of flaga.

prediction of victory at tha poll In

'jolte. and waved his flag, demanding

he said, to offering specific Invitation
by platform planks. '
. "It should be directed.'' he said,
"to those progressives who endorse
the progressive achievements of, the
present administration and the pro
gressive program enunciated in the
platform adopted .here."
Secretary Daniels declared his sup
port of any "practical plan" to prove
to progressives that the democratic
party offers what the progressives are
seeking.'
Tb opposition to the plan to
garner progressive votes wss quite
formidable. Tom Taggart was the
frankest of these, and Is insistent
there is nothing to this "progressive
business." Certain southern leaders
are with hlra. and much Is made of
the wrath that. would be aroused in
the south by such action.
National Committeeman Kwtng of
Louisiana Is not one of those who
felt any danger in this. The prac
tical form tha issue Is taking was in
dicated today by open declaration of
one well known leader that. loan.
much as the democratic party has the
south solidly and can not lose It, the
convention should devote Itself to
winning over 'the states where pro
gressives have been strong and leave
the. south out of consideration.
No expression on the question is
obtainable from 8enator Stone, who

mittee. The Arst session of that com
mlUee will be held this afternoon.
