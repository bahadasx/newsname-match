Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Rev. I. A. Rassey, Pastor
You are cordially
all services.
invited to attend
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
In the absence of the pastor, Rev.
A. B. Blake had charge of the Sunday
services. The subject of the morning
sprmon was "The Importance of Little
Things," the text being in Zechariah
4 :10. At the evening service, lessons
were "drawn from the story of Rulh
and Naomi, the text being in Ruth
1 :16 and 17. The startling event is
that which the secular historian usually
records, and it is refreshing to find
such a story as the one of the evening
recorded at all. It is a pleasure to
read of Joan of Arc but there are
virtues other than those prominent in
her life which should also be sung.
Ruth is the great example of filial
devotion, leaving home, kindred and
country for whatever lot might come
to Naomi. From Naomi she had
learned of God and from henceforth
she would also follow him. Christians
everywhere should make the life they
profess to live such a reality and so
attractive that those with whom they
come in contact will desire it also.

Of the work of Mr. Stannard the White

praise and appreciation of the work
done by Professor Stannard was uni
versal. His stay here has been short,
but high hopes are entertained that he
will be with us again next year. He
has, in his brief stay, gained the love
and respect of every student and the
eordiil liking of the citizens in the
community generally. Sincere are the
hopes and requests that Professor
Stannard will be the one to steer the
course of the high school students dur
ing the next school year." ,

Plans are in process'of development,
whereby Bailey Post, G. A. R.,
contemplates making over its hall and
building, together with the land there
with to the Woman's Relief Corps
during the existence of the latter
organization, after which this said
property would be owned by the town.
The property consists of a large build
ing, two stories high, with spacious
grounds in front and on the easterly
side, located on the northerly side- of
Maia street. It is now cwred, free
from all encumbrance, by Bailey Post,
and the idea, of course, includes the
retention of such ownership during
the existence of the post as an organ
ization, the transfer to be effective
only when the post ceases to exist, as it
naturallywill in the course of few years.
In return the town will, if the contem
plated plans are carried out, erect
in the small park or "flatiron" piece
of land at at the head of Main street,
a monument in memory of said post
and bearing the names of the members
of Bailey post, as well as the name's
of all the soldiers who went from the
town of Troy into service in the Civil
war.
