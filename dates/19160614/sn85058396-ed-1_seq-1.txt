I MAETN GLYMNS SMILE '
i Down under the speaker s stand di-
; ' rect telephone and telegraph wires to
1 i the White House carried momentary
; ; reports of the proceedings in th hall.
' : All prospect of a fight In the conven-
; tlon had gone glimmering' overnight
-, ; with William J. Bryan's announce-
ment that he did not propose to press
: certain planks before tho resoutions'
committee and that he would make
; i campaign speeches for the Democratic
' i nominee.
"We have entered this hall as Dem
: ; ocrats, let us deliberate as Americans"
J aald Mr. Glynn in sounding the key-
J & note.
I t "It is the business of this couven-
1 tlon representing every section of the
1 United States, speaking for lovery
rl racial strain in America to send forth
n a message to all the world that will
i leave no room for ddubt"
Reviewing President Wilson's con-
$ duct of foreign affairs, he declared the
;! president had stood with Washington,
Adams and Grant who had preserved
k. peace with honor.
"For vain glory or for selfish pur-
f pose" Mr, Glynn declared, "others may
cry for a policy of bldod and Iron, but
the president has acted on tho belief
'- that the leader of a nation who plung
; ea his people into an unnecessary war,
"l like Pontius Pilate, vainly washes his
. hands of innocent blood, while the
3 earth, quakes and the heavens are
darkened and thousands give up the
I ghost
I "It Washington was right, if Jeffer
; Bon was right, if Hamilton was right
then the president Is right today" ho
declared.
f Immediately after the prayer Chair-
man McCombs delivered a brief ad-
dress.
4 A real demonstration greeted Mr.
m. McCombs' declaration: "The elephant
if? 1b dead, tho Mooso is dead; long live
Wk ho American Eagle."
m' J. Bruce Kremer, secretary of the
1 1$ national committee, then read tho
I Hr formal call for tho convention.
Wn Glynn Opens Speech.
Iv Sonator Reed of Missouri, Senator
I Taggart of Indiana, and Senator Poni

Ilt' cd Mr. Glynn launched into his key
mr noto speech.
If- Govornor Glynn's declarations upon
iv Americanism and that "the policy ot

Mr. Is as American no the American flag,"
H. "Were given a prolonged demonstration.
HI; Delegates Go Wild.

H election of President Wilson the dele-

ing flags and whistling shrilly Tho
band helped along the demonstration.
E-Governor Glynn, laughing vainly
tried to quiet the delegates but they'
were determined to have it out.
Mr. Glynn pounded his gavel. Soon
the floor was again a sea of flags.
The New Jersey delegation, bearing
its staunchion began the first proces
sion down the front aisle. Stanch
ions of Illinois, Maryland, Indiana and
other states soon followed.
The crowd got entirely out of hand,
but police prevented a general pro
cession by ordering the delegates to
their sections.
When the demonstration has been
going on fifteen minutes appeals were
made to delegates to take their seals
and let the speaker go on. They were
answered by more noise. Finally,
after sixteen minutes, quiet was re
stored and Mr. Glynn went on.
Glynn Repeatedly Applauded.
Mr. Glynn's long recital of efforts by
President Wilson and former presi
dents to preserve American neutrality
and peace was frequently Interrupt
ed by applause.
"Go on,' "go 'on," came shouts
from the crowd.
"Alright, I'll hit them hard," Glynn
answered.
When he told how many presidents
"didn't go to war," and settled trou
bles by negotiatfon, he was repeatedly
cheered.
Glynn proceeded to recite incidents
In diplomatic history In which war was
avoided by Republican presidents.
As Mr. Glynn recounted each in
stance some delegate would shout:
"What did the president do?"
"He settled our troubles by negotia
tions just as the president does now."
Mr. Glynn would reply and the con
vention would roar its approval
When he had spoken one hour. Mr.
Glynn was hal through his prepared
ness speech and he attempted to pass
on to other subjects, but the delegates
wanted more of the same subject.
"I can't stay on that all day," said
Mr. Glynn. "I've got something else
to tell you about."
Women delegates led a demonstra
tion which followed Mr. Glynn's dec
laration that the president's neutrality
pollcv "satisfies the mothers of the
land."
Forced to Repeat Part of Address.
The crowd forced Mr. Glynn to re
peat part of his address, drowned in
applause in which he declared that tho
men of America will fight and die for
our flag when reason primes the rifle,
when honor draws the sword and
when justice breathes a blessing on
the cause that they uphold.
Another prolonged demonstration
followed. From his desk William J.
Bryan joined, tears streaming, and his
face flushed with emotion. A Texas
delegate called out: "Don't forgot
that his policy also satisfies William
J. Bryan."
Mr. Bryan gazed intently at Glynn
and enethusiaslically clapped his
hands in approval ot the speaker's de.
preciation of war.
.In the midst of peroration, the bray
ing of a donkey disturbed Governor
Glynn for a moment. The sound
came through the windows from a
stable in tho rear Evidently the gov
ernor regarded, the braying as approv
al. The audiences laughed, the speak
er smiled and continued to tho end,
a laudation of Woodrow Wilson as
"president and president to be."
Mr. Glynn's declaration for an un
divided loyalty to the flag was cheered
on tho floor and in the galleries. His
praiso of the "Underwood tariff law,
the new federal reserve system and
other administration legislation was
gencroubly applauded.
Delegates Cheer to End.
He concluded at 2:30 a, m. The
delegates stood for two minutes and
cheered.
Alfred E Smith, sheriff of New York
county, drew attention to the fact that
this was Flag Day. Ho asked that the
proclamation recently issued b:
j President Wilson requesting the ob-
i servance of the anniversary of the
birth of the flag be read. There were
no objections and cheers greeted the
reading of the paper
Coliseum, St Louis. Mo, June 14.
At 11-20 o'clock, forty minutes before
time for the convention to be called
to order there were not more than
twenty delegates on the floor, only a
few officials on the platfrom and the
galleries were filliug slowly. There
was little excitement, and bands tnat
marched with the delegates .'rom
downtown furnished the only amuse
ment for the crowd.
Carpenters were beating a. tattoo in
finishing touches upon the hall as the
delegates filed in.
The delegates and alternates had
seats on the main floor, arranged llko
a huge oblong wedge with the broad
side toward the platform Their
seats were 'jammed together, arrange
i ments for both delegates and specta
I tors being much more congested than
jat either convention in Chicago.
, The only picture of President Wil
son was hung on the speaker's stand
It was a small reproduction of a pho
tograph on a shield with a hack
ground of the flag, and boro the in
scription "America First." '
The coliseum filled rapidly just be
fore n'oon, some delay in opening the
rloors to spectators preventing an
parlier influx TIip bands accompa
nied the delegations to the hall, but
wero not allowed to march into the
hall. There was little excitement or
cheering during the half hour preced
ing the opening of the convention.
Moving picture machines were
planted at every vantage point.
Because of the heat under a glar
ing skylight, many of the delegates
soon removed their coats and it prom
ised soon to become a coatless crowd.
Texas delegation tossed miniaturo
1 souvenir bales of cotton to the gal
leries New Song Brings Applause.
At 11.45 the official band began
playing the opening selection in ac
companiment to a male quartette that
I sang a new song about America
through megaphones. The song
brought the first applause of the day.
Dixie Brings the Rebel Yell.
Just before tho convention was call
ed to order the band struck up "Co
lumbia, the Gem of the Ocean," and
the delegates rose joining- in the
chorus, ajid waving . American Jlags.
"Dixie" brought a roar Interrupted
with tho rebel yell.
William J. Bryan was cheered as he
took his seat in the press section.
The applause for him started in the
galleries and then spread to the dele
gates. Mr. Bryan smiled his-appreciation
and got out his pencil and
prepared for his reportorial duties.
A "woody tiger" was sent to Chair
man McCombs' desk by a New York
delegate.
The crowd was patient, orderly ana
quiet as it waited for the convention
to begin. A half hour after the time
set for the start the delegates still
were coming in.
McCombs Calls Order.
Chairman McCombs took his place
at his desk at 12:30 a. m. amid ap
plause A few thumps of his gavel on
a wooden sounding board quickly se
cured order and he cried:
"Tho convention will be In order.
One verse of "America" was then
sung by the entire crowd wHh tossing
flags keeping the rhythm.
This was followed by one verse of
the "Star .Spangled Banner"

MANY STORIES CLOSE

People on "America
First."
Washington, June 14. Led by Pres
ident Wilson carrying the Stars and
Stripes nearly seventy-five thousand
men, women and children of Washing
ton marched up broad Pennsylvania
avenue today in a preparedness par
ade arranged to emphasize tho nation
al capital's demand for an adequate
army and navy.
Besides marching himself and then
reviewing the parade the president de
livered an address on "America first"
In the afternoon at an open air meot
ing south of tho Whito House.
Washington was brilliantly decorat
ed for tho occasion. It was a holi
day, for under an executive order Issu
ed by the president, all government
employes wore excused from work and
many stores wero closed.
Wilson Sets Precedent,
President Wilson decided to set a
precedent by walking during tho en
tire length of tho parade. Former
Presidents Roosevelt and Tart also
had been Invited but found it impos
sible to participate.
Beginning at the Ptjaco Monumont,
near tho capltol building, the lino of
march passed the postofflco nnd treas
ury department bulIdlngB and then
reached tho White IIouso where a re
viewing stand draped with American
r flags had boen erected There the

It is not expected that any real opposition will develop to the re
nomination of Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana for second place on" the
Democratic ticlqet
president left the head of the parade
and entered the stand to watch the
remainder of the line pass by.
Ne regular military organizations
were permitted to march because Sec
retaries Baker and Daniels thought
that it would be improper for profes
sional soldiers or sailors to partici
pate. After marching in review the parad
ers were directed to proceed to the
open space back of the White House
where a temporary stand was erected
for the flag day exercises. President
Wilson planned to begin speaking at
3 d. m.
Marches Briskly to Music.
The president, attired in white trous
ers, blue coat, and straw hat, and
shouldering his flag like a musket,
stepped briskly to martial airs played
by the United States Marino Band.
He smiled broadly and frequently rais
ed his hat In response to cheers as
he marched along between two Dis
trict citizens, escorted by Secretary
Tumulty, tho Whit House employes
and the White House newspaper cor
respondents. Ideal weather favored the demon
stration. There was hardly a cloud In
tho sky and It was as cool as late
spring Enthusiastic crowds thronged
the avenue from Peace Monument to
the White House.
President is Warned.
As the line swung around the treas
ury building at Fifteenth Street and
Pennsylvania avenue tho president
was confronted by a huge banner
bearing the legend "Be Prepared If
You Care About Ninety One Electoral
Votes, Consider Us Woman's Party."
It was the work of the Congressional
Union for Woman's Suffrage.
The president's criticism of the po
litical activity of foreign born citizens
was caused, administration officials
explained later, by recent editorials
In foroign language newspapers in
the United States and published state
ments of so-called hyphenated Ameri
cans on tho coming campaign. It i3
understood that the address will be
echoed at the Democratic national con
vention at St. Louis.
Speaking of disloyalty In the United
States, tho president said:
"The editors form a minority, a very
small minority but an active and sub
tle minority, working underground but
also showing its ugly head where It
may be seen and It is this minority
that at this very moment that is striv
ing to levy a kind of political black
mail or wreak its vengeance at the
polls. This is the sort of thing
-against which tho American people
will turn That 1b tho lesson which I
come to remind you of ioday "

The national Democratic commltteo
has adopted a design for a campaign

teeman McLean of North Carolina.
It bears a picture of President Wilson

RAILROAD IH
FAIL TO AGREE
Unions Reject Proposals of
Road Officials New An
swer Must Be Made.
New York, Juno u( The fate of the
negotiations between the railroad
managers of the United States and
their employes 'for a settlement of
the 'wage discussion hung today on
the willingness of the railroads to
"present a different answer" to tho
men's demands.
The union heads at their conference
here today rejected tho railroads' "con
tingent" proposition and demanded
"something definite." The railroad
managers met this afternoon to de
termine what action would be taken.
The conference then adjourned un
til tomorrow.
New York, Juno 14. Railway man
agers and officials of railway unions,
who have been discussing wages and
hours of woi;k, believed that this
would bo the last day of their confer
ence and that it would end In a dead
lock. ,Tho conference has been In
session most of the time since Janu
ary 1 and is estimated to have cost
upwards of $100,000. More than S00
delegates from unions of railway em
ployes representing 350,000 workers,
have attonded.
The union men have rejected flatly
a proposal by the managers that no
man shall be paid twice for the same
time, although his day may be divided
between two classes of work. Some
of tho 105 questions submitted by the
men to the managers remained to bo
answered today. After this It was
expected tho conference would ad
journ. Iibor leaders said the next step
would be to submit to the unions a
referendum voto as to whether the
officials should be empowered to ex
ercise their own judgment in calling a
strike. If that were decided In the
affirmative another conference of the
mnnagors would be called.

London, Juno 11, 12:50 a. m Re
ports from the eastern front indicate
that the Russians are making sub

Paris, June 14. Tho fighting around i
Vordun has once moro died down
from sheer exhaustion of combatants.
An entire division, half of whom
wero Bavarians and half Pomeranians
was brought up by tho Germans in
twelve separato attempts Monday to 1
storm the French positions north of
Thlaumont. From this position the
French flanking fire prevents the ene- l
my from advancing on the Vaux plat- H
eau. As no results had been attained H
