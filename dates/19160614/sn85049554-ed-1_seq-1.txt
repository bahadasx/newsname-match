his son Kermit, the colonel explained
that* his coughing probably had

GIRL'S DEATH DUE
TO LIQUID POISON
Coroner Taylor Testifies That Death
Potion Taken by Marian Lambert
Was Not in Crystal Form—tEvidenoe
Regarded as Important.
Waukegan, 111., June 14.—Dr. John
L. Taylor, coroner, testified today at
the trial of Will H. Orpet, for the al
leged murder of Marian Lambert, that
the cyanide of potassium which caused
death, was tfken In liquid form. He
based this statement on allegations that
stains of the poison on Miss Lambert's
person was sediment and not cyanide
in crystal form.
ThljB point was regarded as important
by the state in connectioh with the I
statement that Orpet bought a bottle
of the poslon in Madison.
The defense, It was said, will con
tend that IMISB Lambert brought thej
enrrn*)v» tn crystal farm with her.
Dr. Taylor said stains of sediment
were on Miss Lambert's hand and a
streak extended from a corner of her
mouth toward her forehead, as if left
there by a trickle of liquid.
Witness did not make a microscopic
examination of the stains.
There was no confirmation of re
ports that Josephine Davis would be
charged with perjury as a result of
discrepancies in the testimony before
the grand Jury and before the court.
Josephine Davis sought to atoue yes

Lambert, her dearest girl friend. It
was on her testimony principally that
the grand jury of Lake County voted
this charge on March 6.
Miss Davis did her best to undo the
mistake she says she made-when her
heart was sick with "spite" for the per
son she suspected of causing the death
of her chufai, and she did It bravely.
"I promised Marian never, to my
dying day, to tell the secret of her re
lations with Will Orpet," was her sim
ple explanation of the seal on her Hps
which broke so unexpectedly Monday.
Then with ^pne Statement she shook
.the fabric, of which she was a busy
weaver, that'has held Or^pet In the
tolls:
"Marian told me if fihpet rfave her
up she would kill hftfself," sht» as
serted.
This occurred on her eighteenth
birthday, when she entertained eight
een girls.
'They are all so happy, Jo, and I
can't be happy knowing my condition',"
Marian said on that occasion. Then she
cried and Josephine said she led the
girl Into a bedroom, where she threat
ened to kill herself If her sweetheart
failed her. That was three days before
her death in Heim's woods by cyanide
of potassium poisoning.
Josephine at this point broke down
for the first time during her long story
of her Intimate friendship with Mar
ian and did a little crying herself.
Josephine was again at the Lambert
home on Feb. 8, the day before she
died.
"Did you notice anything unusual in
her behavior?" asked Attorney Ralph
F. Potter of the defense.
"She appeared worried and nervous.
The window blind was flapping and
she got up several times to tlx It. She
stood at the window and looked out
for long periods. I was half asleep and
didn't pay much attention to her."
Previously, when Marian hud been
told by a schoolmate that Orpet was
engaged to Celeste Youiter, ane ap
peared despondent, Josephine said.
'If Will is engaged to marry Ce
leste I'll fix him,'" Marian remarked,
the witness said. "I asked her what
she meant and she said: 'Oh, never
mind you'll And out'."
Mariun's fueling for Orpet was
strong enough to cause her to save all
his letters, she said. She identified
nearly fifty of them and spoke of hav
ing seen them in a' bundle tied with
blue ribbon.
REPLY TO CARRANZA
DELAYED ONE WEEK
Considered Inadvisable to Dispatch
Note Until After Democratic Con
vention, to Eliminate Inference of
Political Influences Upon Reply.
Washington, June, 14.—The United
States reply to the last note from Car
ranza probably will not be sent until
after the 6t. Louis convention. The
delay was considered advisable to'
eliminate inference that any action
toward Merle* at. this time might
interpreted as prompted by political
influences.
That course has been laid out par-,
tlcularly in view of Carranza's strong
intimations that the United States'
dealings with Mexico, have been de
termined JCry questions of internal poli
tics in this country.
The answer which .Secretary
Lansing is preparing will rebuke Car
r&naa sharply for that Insinuation, it
is said.
Administration officials still are
worried over prospects of serious anti
American outbreaks In (Mexico.
