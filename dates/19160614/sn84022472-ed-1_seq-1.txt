The great DuPont interests par
( chased, the Fairfield Rubber Co. of
i Fairfield, yesterday and will continue
the. plant as at present for the time
being, with the probability that it will
: soon be increased from five to eight
' times capaelty. '
All the old employes who have serv-
ed the Harral interests so loyally for
I periods of from 10 to 30 years, will
be retained or pensioned . under an
j agreement forced by K. "WV Harral in
; the contract sale. Fairfield residents
i are assured by the .new interests
I which took charge today 'that the com
! pany will not manufacture powder in
I any form there.
Hereafter, while the plant will con
. tinue to be . known as the Fairfield
: Rubber Co., that the' prestige which
has been gained in 85 years' manufac-
ture of the standard rubber cloth may
,-ot be lost, the DuPont Fabrikoid Co..
', incorporated,, of Delaware, will toe in
full charge. .
E. W. Harral and his few associates,
closely related, have built up an enor
mous trade in rubber cloth. While
strict industrial methods would have
greatly increased the output, the aim
has rather, been to keep .peace, har
mony and allegiance among' the em
ployes. During the last year the
company; has been compelled to limit
its delivery to old customers while new
ones clamored for goods. An offer
to sell was refused until it was shown
that the employes, ' toahy' of twhom
have faithfully served for 3 5 years,
were be cared- for under the pen
sion plan of the big E. I. DuPont de
Nemoura Co., of wljjch. the new com
pany is subsidiary. i
When President E. W. Harral made
his parting farewell yesterday in the
plant he had supervised daily since
1881, the scene throughout the shop
was affecting. TheTconsideration of
sale '- is" not iknown.
The Fairfield Rubber Co. is gen
erally said to have "made Fairfield,"
for that part of itsN population that
has had to work for a. living. Nearly
half a century ago the people of the
town were dependent upon their crops
ofNmions and potatoes. The onions
were carted to nearby cities or shipped
to New York form Southport. Em
ployment , in Bridgeport was little
sought, because in the absence of trol
ley cars, those who worked in the
Park City had 'to start very early in
thejnorning, on foot.
The plant was built by James Mott,
Ck philanthropic resident of Fairfield,
who did much for the town. He plan
tiled to conduct a rubber cloth making
plant and give jobs to Fairfielders.
The building stood idle many years
until the late Nathaniel Wheeler pur
chased it. He gave employment to
many me,n and women and better
times were enjoyed. Since then it has
been conducted by E. W. Harral. son-in-law
of Mr. Wheeler.
The majority of those working in
the plant have been with it for years
and some have worked scarcely any
other place. The product of the plant
Is a rubberized cloth, which is used
for automobile tops, curtains, etc.
Henry Ford is one of the largest cus
tomers. .

It was announced today by E. W.
Harral, of .123 Harrison street, that
purchase of the Star Shirt factory
property on Golden Hill street and
Washington avenue had been, fully
completed for the purpose of recon
struction into a magnificent apart
ment house.
In addition the triangular piece of
ground fronting the factory at the in
tersection of the two streets formerly
owned by the Calhoun. Latham estate
has been purchased ' for restrictive
purposes. Architects .are now being
employed to look over the industrial
plant with a view to drawing plans for
a handsome and elaborately divided

pancy will be had in the fall. The
apartment will be one of -the most

Taxes on Water Co.'s
Easton Holdings Are
Cut By Court Decision
The Bridgeport Hydraulic C. has
Succeeded in getting a reduction in
taxes on its holdings in Easton. Judge
Webb of the superior court handed
down a decision today fixing the value
of the company's property in Easton
at $272,439. The Easton board of
appraisers had fixed the valuation
at $288,648 while the company listed
the property at $259,252. After the
board of relief confirmed the asses

FRANCES HEFT
LOSES IN SUIT
FOB MORE CASH
Judge Webb Upholds Exe
cutors of Estate in Ali
mony Action.
FAILED TO PROVE
FRAUD, HE FINDS
First Wife of Street Rail
way Magnate Has Ob
tained $20,000.
The attempt of Frances Helens
Heft to get additional alimony from
the estate of the late Col. N. H. Heft
was defeated today when Judge Webb
of the superior court granted a mo
tion of non-suit in the action brought'
by the first wife of the local railway
magnate against Mary Josephine M.
Heft and other executors of the estate.
The court held that the plaintiff had
failed to prove fraud on the . part of
Col. Heft at the time he submitted
the value of his estate.
The motion for non-suit was made
by Judge John S. Pullman, represent
ing the executors. He reviewed the
history of the case, calling "attention
to' the fact that Frances Heft had re-i
ceived $20,000 alimony at the time
she got a divorce form Col. Heft in
1902. The court then placed the val
ue of the Heft estate at $100,000.
Frances Heffe. claimed the colonel de
ceived her by not including in his In
ventory certain stock of the Green--wlch
Tramway Co. and the 'New "Fork
Stamford Street Railway Co. At the
time of the divorce Judge Pullman de
clared this stock was of doubtful
value. The roads had been construct
ed, he said, solely with the idea of un
loading them on the New Haven Rail
road Co. at some future time.
Three years after the divorce Col.
Heft did sell them to the New Haven
system and for his stock received New
Haven bonds worth about $300,000.
But this did. hot indicate that his
statements to his first wife in 1902 (had
been deceptive. Judge Pullman said
he did not think the executor ought to
be forced to make a defense as it
might be necessary to Introduce testi
mony regarding family history which
would contradict previous evidence.
-After the court's decision Stanley
Heft, son of the late Col. Heft and oae
of those contesting the present action,
walked; across the court room and
shook hands with Frances. - The plain
tiff sued for $l50,ooo.

"Theodore Roosevelt will support

Bridgeport,' Just elected Republican
national committeeman from Con
necticut. He made this ; declaration to a re

10:11 train for New York city, this
forenoon. This afternoon he and other

were to be in conference with the
Republican nominee at his headquar
ters in the Hotel Astor.
Mr. King sees nothing ahead but
Republican victory a sweeping vic
tory. "Woodrow Wilson won't carry a
state outside of the slave states," said
Mr. King.
It will be recalled that the Bridge
porter who attended the national
convention as one of the Big Four of
Connecticut cast his vote for Fair
banks for president.
"Mr. Fairbanks," declared V Mr.
King, warmly "is the 'nearest to the
McKinley type that we have in the
Republican party. I have known him
personally. I admire him."
Mr. King would not discuss state
or local policies. But he reiterated
his confidence in a great Republican
sweep.
RACE SUICIDE IS
NO GROUND FOR
DIVQRCEJECREE
Judge WebbDecidesAgainst
Casting Off of Alleged
"Man-Hater."
The fact that a woman is a believer
In race suicide does not constitute a
ground for divorce in this state, ac
cording to a decision handed down to
day by Judge Webb of the superior
court. The decision was given in the
suit brought by George NeftT of this
city against Florence Neff and is the
first to be made on this legal question.
Neff claimed his wife was " a man
hater," as he remarked in his testi
mony, and that she deceived hHm re
garding her views on marriage. He
also charged her with cruelty. Mrs.
Neff denied the charges. She said it
was not her fault that the marriage
has not proved happy.
The court held that Neff had not
proved his allegation regarding Mrs.
Neff's "man hating" ideas, and Judge
Wedd continues, "Even if he proved
his claim, tjis does not constitute
legal ground for divorce."

KILEY RIDES IN CAR
TO SHOOT HIS WIFE
Separated Several Months,
Couple Clash in Hallway
of Home.
Averting near tragedy by pushing her"
son-in-law through a door as he was
about to shoot his young wife, Mrs.
John Flood of 1858 Stratford, avenue,
Sunday afternoon, saved the life of
her daughter and the domestic trials
of the young couple were aired in
the city court today when Deputy
Judge Wilder fined the husband, John
Kiley, 26 years old of 24 Jtfiles
street, $ 1 and costs ' and suspended a
30 day jail sentence. As the result
of the trouble between Kiley and his
wife, the latter will probably bring
divorce proceedings.
Kiley who at one time sailed the
seas as a member of the United
States navy returned to this city a
few years ago and fell in love with
Grace Flood, cashier and bookkeeper
at the furniture store conducted by
George B. Clark. He proposed mar
riage and she accepted. .
In January 1915, he led his bride
to the altar of St. Mary's church
where they were made man and wife.
For several weeks they lived happily
and contented but then the husband
gave up his position as a . machinist
in a factory here and refused to
work. He is alleged to have started
drinking and his wife left him.
Several times since the first sep
aration they have been reconciled but
every time Kiley has given way to his
vices and the couple have separated.
About three weeks ago, relatives and
friends of the pair persuaded the wife
to give Kiley another chance and she
consented. He rented the house on
Miles street and they started keeping
house. He had a good position with
the Bullard Machine Tool Mfio. and
was earning good wages as a machin
ist.
But he could not keep to the
straight and narrow." After working
for 10 days or so he gave up the job
and again started drinking. His wife
left him ' again and . returned to live
with her mother.
Sunday afternoon,, while the wife
was atUxer - mother's "home the door
bell rang and answering it she saw
Kiley standing on the porch. He had
come to the house in an automobile.
Stepping into the hallway, he said,
"Now I've got you . and . I'll fix you
this time." He reached for his hand
trouser pocket. The wife grasped
his hand and felt a revolver in the
pocket.
A tussle ensued and Mrs. Flood,
hearing the noise, hurried downstairs.
Separating the pair, she pushed Kiley
out of the house , and he ran to the
sidewalk, 'jumped into the machine
and ordered the chauffeur to drive
away.
Word-of the scuffle and near trag
edy was telephoned the Second pre
cinct police station and the police
men were warned to watch out for
Kileyt - About 2 o'clock Monday
morning. Policeman . John F. McPad-
den saw Kiley at the corner of " Bar-'
num and Sea view avenues. He ar
rested him and found a revolver in
his pocket. .. Kiley was also in an in
toxicated condition.
In court t6day. Judge Wilder se
verely reprimanded Kiley for his ac
tions and In passing sentence stated
that should he ever face the court
again for bothering his wife or. on
any other charge, the jail sentence
will have to be served and whatever
additional sentence is meted out. As
sistant Prosecuting Attorney E. Earle
Garlick recommended that the jail
sentence be suspended, as Attorneys
Thomas C. Coughlin for Kiley and
Irving Elson for Mrs. Kiley had
agreed to 'that.
' I V.nii CT"V if was en ..on H t. T-onn.a
hat the wife would bring divorce
procedings against Kiley as long as a
conviction had been,' procured. Attor
ney Elson stated after court that he
would be unable to, make any state

Harmony and Enthusiasm
Convention is Called to Order in St. Louis
McCombs Scores Republicans and Pro
gressives in Opening Address, and Keynote!
Speech By Former Gov. Glynn Brings Pro-
longed Cheering From Delegates and Spec
tators.
i
' Coliseum, St. Louis, June 14 "Wilson and Marshall and
Victory." That is the program of the Democratic national
convention jwhich came to order here at 12:32 o'clock this af
ternoon. Candidates agreed upon both President Wilson and Vies
President Marshall will be renominated, probably by accama
tion the 1,000 delegates went into convention with harmony
and enthusiasm for the ticket manifest everywhere.
Only the. phraseology of some of the platform planks were
to" be agreed upon. The probability .of a convention fight over
the platform seemed remote. Secretary of War Baker arriv
ed here last night from Washington with a copy of planks
drafted-by President Wilson. They will be submitted to the
j resolutions committee.
I The delegates were given
when Chairman W. F. McCombs, calling the convention to
order, delivered a sharp criticism of the Republican and Pro
gressive platforms. The address by former Gov. MartinH. .
Glynn, of New York, as temporary chairman brought repeated
outbursts of applause. Especially was the enthusiastic ap
proval of the delegates manifest when Mr. Glynn referred to
the President as the greatest statesman since Lincoln.
Efforts to insert a plank in the
Democratic platform favoring a law
to prohibit federal judges from leaving
the bench to accept elective office will
not be countenanced by President Wil
son.' The President sent word here
that he did not want any petty politics
played.
Quite in contrast to the convention
at Chicago, when more than a score
of different kinds of buttons were
worn, announcing favorite son candi
dates for resident, there was but one
button seen on delegates today and
that carried a likeness of president
Wilson. Deli ?ates shoiitfi for Wilson,
wore , neckties with th name Wilson
embroidered on them, or carried pic
tures of the President. Those who
did not have on Wilson buttons wore
some emblem indicating their favorite
for Vice-President, Thomas R. Mar
shall, of Indiana, Roger C. Sullivan, of
Illinois, Governor Major, of Missouri,
or Governor Morehead, oft Nebraska.
But only one of th$se appeared to be
in the running, the present Vice-President.
.
President Wilson has indicated his
preference for his running mate of
four years ago, and there is not the
slightest doubt that his wish will be
gratified. The other candidates may
receive complimentary votes but if
the' leaders who are managing the
convention can bring it about, Vice
President Marshall will be re-nominated
by acclamation.
Nearly everybody who went to the
convention from the eastern part of St.
Louis journeyed by way of Washing
ton street, which for two hours before
the convention convened was trans
formedvin a "Golden Lane."
On either side of the broad avenue
stood women' suffragists arrayed in
yellow. They stood or sat on stools
a few feet apart and did not utter a
word to the passing throng making
their way to the convention hall. The
gold line stretched for 12 blocks from
the hotel district to the coliseum and
the mute demonstration was expected
by its originators to influence the del
egates in the matter of a declaration
for suffrage.
Platform building was continued by
potential leaders of the party today
so as to have much of the work in
readiness for the convention's consid
eration of the resolutions.
Expressions of approval were heard
today regarding the, suggested plan to
win over members bf the Progressive
party by making overtures to them in '
the Democratic platform. Secretary
Baker in discussing this phrase of the
political situation said the party lead
ers hoped to get progressive support
by drawing a platform so that it will
meet with their approval.
Denunciation of the use of the mili
tia and armed guards against organ
ized workers is contained in a pro
posed industrial plank submitted ; by
Frank P. Walsh, former chairman of
thf! federal industrial relations com
mJ.iee, to Senator Stone, who will be

Clares the right of labor unions to or
ganize. t 11:20 o'clock, 40 minutes before
time for the Democratic convention ton
be called to order there were not more
than 20 delegates on tne floor, only a
iw officials on the platform and the
galleries were filling slowly. There
was little excitemeart and bands that
marched ' with the delegations from
downtown furnished the enly amuse
ment for the crowd.
Carpenters were beating a tattoo in
finishing touches upon, the hall as the
delegates filed in.
The delegates and alternates naa
seats on the main floor, arranged like
a huge oblong wedge, with the broad
side toward the platform. Their1 seats
were jammed together, arrangements
for both delegates and spectators be
ing mucn more congested mat at
either convention in Chicago. .
The only picture of President W ll-
son was hung on the speaker's stand..
It was a small reproduction of a pho
tograph on a shield with a background
of the flag and 'bore the inscription
"America First."
The Coliseum filled rapidly just be
fore noon, some delay in opening the
doors preventing spectators from ear
lier influx. The bands accompanied
the delegates to the hail . but were

their first chance to cheer
not allowed to march into it. There
was little excitement or cheering dur
ing.the half hour preceedmg the open
ing of the convention. Moving pic-1
ture machines an cameras were placed
at every vantage point.
Because of the heat, under a glaring
skylight, many of the delegates re
moved their coats and it promised
soon to be a coatless 'crowd.
At 11:45 the Official band began
the opening concert in accompiment
to a male quartet that sang a new
song about America through mega
phones. The national committee has adopted
a design for a campaign button sug
gested by National Committeeman
McLean, of North Carolina. It bears
a picture of President Wilson with
the motto "America First" in red let
ters. Just before the convention was
called to order the band struck up
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,"
and the delegates rose, joining in the
chorus and wavirlg American flags.
"Dixie" brought a roar, interrupted
with the rebel yell. William J. Bryan
was given; an ovation as he took his
seat in the, press section. Mr. Bryan
smiled his appreciation, got put 'his
pencil and prepared for his reportorial
duties.
A wooden tiger was sent to Chair
man. McComb's desk by the New York
delegation. '
Chairman McCombs took his place
at his desk at 12:30 amid cheers and
applause. A few thumps of his gavel
on a wooden sounding board quickly
secured order and he cried: - "The
convention will be In order."
One verse of "America" was then
sung by the entire crowd, with tossing
flags in rhythm. This was followed
by one verse of the "Star Spangled!
Banner." .
Rev. James Lee, Methodist Episco
pal clergyman, read this proyer:
"We thank Thee, O Lord, for all the
