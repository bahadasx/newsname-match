Presence of Suffragettes is the Only 'Exciting
I
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
ST. IjOIOIS, MO., June 14.—Some
thing over two thousand persons
assembled here at noon today to
waste time, to speak and listen to
speeches three days before they do
the one thing for -which they have
been chosen. In other words, the
democratic national convention was
called to order by National Chairman
MdCorobs and started on its oratori
cal way toward the renomination of
Wilson and Marshall.
It was the women—suffrages us—
and the flag, who furnished the color
to the gathering today. Democrats
seized upon flag day which la today,
to arouse the crowd to a high frenzy
of patriotism. Nearly 16,000 flags
were distributed to delegates, alter
JMtai and spectators. At a given
imo big flags
in the Coliseum and with the band
playing the Star Spangled Banner,
the great hall will too transformed,
into a sea of waving flags.
The women staged a silent demon
stration of their plea for the ballot.
For two hours the suffrage workers
dressed in the white and gold of the
suffrage colors, lined Locust street
for Hie distance between the Jeffer
son hotel and the Coliseum. They
didn't say a word—the idea was
simply to bore in on the conscious
ness of the delegates the tact that
the women desired equal suffrage.
Because of the very fact that the
work of the convention is so perfunc
tory, there was a growing sentiment
today among delegates that its work
will be hurried along. There may be
an attempt "made to. advance the
date ot the nomination. The dele
gates know there is only one candi
date for presidential nomination.
They sire perfectly willing to adopt
any Bort of a platform pleasing to
him, so why fuss and speechify and
bake in the heat and pay big hotel
rates for several perfectly unneces
sary days. The plan to consolidate
several of the purely speeching ses
sions grew in favor today with
knowledge that President Wilson re
gards unlucky Friday as one of his
lucky days end would be perfectly
happy to be renominated on that day.
The original plan was to wait until
after midnight Friday to put through
the national ticket.
The program for today's session
was purely routine. First of all.
Chairman MoCombs sang his swan
song as national chairman. Then he
introduced the temporary cfhairman,
former Governor Martin H. Glynn,
of New York, the "key-noter his
speech concluded, there were a few
details of organization to Ibe attended
to .before the convention adjourned
until Thursday. Democrats would
like very much to have some sort of
a row just to furnish a little excite­

Ideal Conditions.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
OOiLISEUiM, ST. LOUIS, 1M0., June
14.—Democracy's representatives nev
er met under such ideal conditions
as they did here today. First of all
the party of Jefferson was unanimous
in its choice of candidates for the
national ticket there was complete
accord on the platform on whicii
those candidates were to appeal to
the public and fullest agreement on
the program. Finally, seldom has a
political convention met in such a
beautiful hall as that which St. Louis
furnished.
Vacated only Saturday night by
another meeting, carpenters and
workmen accomplished a masterpiece
in their renovation of the big hall. A
specially installed skylight made it
as light as day in the huge interior
and the whole inside was aglow with
the red, white and blue of old
glory. The entire ceiling was cover
ed with white. A special balcony
which added nearly 1,000 to the 10,
000 seating capacity of the place,
was draped with the national colors,
with huge plaster medallions show
ing democracy's famous men of the
past In bas-relief, hung at the top of
each white draped pillar.
Not so vast in its proportions as
the hall at Baltimore, where four
years ago the cohorts of democracy
nominated their victorious candi
dates, nor as huge and barn-like as
the Coliseum in Chicago, wihere the
republicans last week named their
ticket, the St. Louis Coliseum gave
an air of comfort, a closeness and of
cheer—exactly the setting for the
harmonious. get-togetherness and
closeness of the ranks of democracy
in 1916.
ROOSEVELT HAD A PAIN
BUT NOT SERIOUSLY SICK

Some Alarm Expressed Be

Over Heart.
NEW YORK, June 14.—Colonel
Roosevelt today suffered from a se
vere pain in his "side and as a result
frequently pressed his hand against
his side, near his heart, while motor
ing to the home of his son-in-law,
Dr. Richard Derby. He had been to
the dock to greet his son, Kermit, and
the letter's wife and baJby. The col
onel said the pain was of no conse

in.
Of no Consequence.

daughter of 0*M1 J*OOM?«1W
The day was warm enough to oe
to the United Press. "He has been
troubled with a' cough and may have
strained a muscle that may have
caused him to put his hand to his
side. That's all."
The colonel was at the Derby
home when Mrs. Derby made this
statement. He is due to leave with
in a short time for his office down
town.
The colonel later visited his Phy
sician to have his throat sprayed.
Dr. Derby accompanied him.
John McGratb, Colonel Roosevelt
secretary, announced early this aft
ernoon that while the ligament which
the colonel strained while coughing,
was not in a serious condition,
Roosevelt would remain in town to
night and have an X-ray examination
made. He had planned to return to
Oyster Bay tonight.
Roosevelt did not go to the oi

where he had appointments around
noon, and remained at his hotel In

It was nearly ll o'clock before
workmen put the finishing touches on
the decorations and erected the last
iron standard marking off the state
delegations on the floor of the hall.
Incidentally it was remarked that
a tremendous excess of zeal and en
thusiasm be necessary if there was
any .parade of standards this year—
since the same standards were ten
feet tall, of two inch iron pipe and
securely screwed to the floor with
five 3-inch bolts.
Three hundred and fifty of St.
Louis' "finest" kept the crowd in
check within and without the hall,
w&ile 100 firemen were detailed to
prevent smoking and watch out for
any incipient blazes. The whole
block around the Coliseum was Toped
off and splendid order maintained
as the thousands gathered for the
sessions.
At 11 o'clock, when workmen were
still taoking up decorations, and
looking to see that things were ship
shape, tihe spectators and delegates
began arriving. At each entrance,
•boy scouts handed every ticket hold
er a tiny American flag, while on
every seat was a slip with the verses
of the "'Star Spangled Banner"
printed thereon.
The crowd was slow in straggling
in, due to the multiplicity of attrac
tions without—the suffragettes garb

concerts and interest In the arrival
of the celebrities. Hawaiian dele

crowds !by their singing of native

Colonel John I. Martin, who has
ibeen sergeant at arms of all demo

four years, was early on the job. It
was an old story to him, but he was
just as enthusiastic and as energetic
about things* as if he had been the
youngest of new comers.
Roger Sullivan was the first of the
notables to arrive. He felt so lone

he finally climbed down on the floor,

It was exactly 12:30 when Chair

waited a moment before banging his

"Order" was restored at once.
"America" was sung the entire
audience rising while those on the
platform waved their flags in unison.
The Star Spangled Banner came
next. The audience sang at the last
named song and then most of them
gavo it up. It was plain the crowd
sticking to the newly varnished seats
was anxious to go ahead. Only a
brief yell greeted the conclusion of
the song service.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 14.—A con

pairs of feminine eyes was turned
upon the delegates to the democratio
national convention today in an ap
peal of votes for women.
The attack, staged by the national
woman's suffrage organization headed
by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt is to
be the most spectacular event of the
suffrage campaign before the conven

will for two hours try lo stare a

[By J. P. Yoder, United Press Staff

WASHINGTON, June 14.—For the
first time in history a president of
the United States today marched on
foot in historic Pennsylvania avenue
as a participant in a propaganda
parade. The avenue was Washiug
ton's plea for preparedness and a
tributo to the flag, today being the
anniversary of the adoption by con
gress of tho stars and stripes as the
ir.t onal emblem.
Immediately in front of the presi
dent was the United States marina
band working as never any band did
before. They had to set their musk
to the marching cadence the presiv
dent set and it was some cadence, a
matter of some 144 steps to the
minute. Despite a grilling sun, the
president didn't Beem to mind his
hike a bit. He walked With a jaunty
swing, that kept a large pompous
gentleman on his left pumping the
whole distance of a mile and a half.
The president wore a blue serge
coat, white duck trousers and shooj
with socks and tie to match the
trousers and a boyish straw hat.
Rudolph Kaufman and William F.
