Suffragists, Mute, Lined the
Highway Leading to
Convention Hall.
(By Associated Press)
BT. LOUIS, Mo., June 14.?"Wilson
and Marshal and Victory in November"
was tho program of the delegates who
crowned into the big Coliseum here
today for the opening session of the
Democratic national convention. There
probably was not ono Democrat who
went into the biulding who could re
call when a National convention of
that party entered upon its work with
more harmony than that which pre
vailed among the more than 1000 del
egates today.
The candidates for President and
vice president have ben decided on
and according to leaders there will be
no friction over the party's declaration
of principles. Only the phraseology
of a few planks of the platform are to
be agreed on. ?
Those who looked for clear weather
for the convention were a bit disap
pointed to learn that conditions were
uncertain. Ther was however one
thing virtually certain and that was
that it was warm enough to make tfci
closely packed crowd in the Coliseum
[?welter. , 4 . 4V
Nearly everybody who went to the
[convention from the eastern part 01
fSti Louis Journeyed by way of Wash
ington street which lor 2 hours be
I fore the convention convened was
transformed into a "golden lane." On
either sido of the broad avenue stood
-Jwoinan suffragists arrayed in yellow.
They stood or sat on stools a few feet
apart and did not utter a word to
the-passlng throng making their way
fgfio the convention hall. The Golden
lane stretched for 12 blocks from the
district to the Coliseum and the
-- mute demonstration'W*&^xptfct?dsbr
1 Its originators to Influence the dele
gates in the matter of a declaration
for suffrage.
At 11:20 o'clock 40 minutes before
the tlmo for tho Democratic national
convention to be called to order there
were not more than 20 delegates on the
floor, only a few officials on the plat
form and the gallierles filling slowly.
There was little excitement. The
carpenters were beating a tatoo in
finishing touches on the hall as dele
gates filed in.
The delegates and alternates had
seats on the main floor arranged like
a huge oblong wedge with the broad
side toward the platform. Their seats
were jammed togother, arrangements
for both delegates and spectators be
ing much more congested than at
either convention in Chicago.
The only picture of President Wil
son was hung on the speaker's stand.
It was a small reproduction of a pho
tograph on a shield with a background
ojC flags and bore the Inscription.
"American First"
The Coliseum filled rapidly just be
m ofre noon. Some day in opening the
doors to spectators preventing an
early influx. The bands accompanied
the delegation to hall but were not al
lowed to march Into the hall. Few
delegations came in all together and
ther was little excitement an'l cheer
ing during the half hour preceding the
opening of the convention.
r. Moving picture machines and cam
eras were planted at every vantage
point. Because of the heat under the
glaring skylight many of delegates
soon removed coats and it promised
soon to becomo a coatless crowd.
Texas delegations tossed miniature
souvenir balls of cotton to the galler
ies. At 11:45 the offficlal band began
the opening concert In accompaniment
i.o a male quartet which sang a new
ho"\s about Amerclan through a meg
aphone. The song brought the first ap
plause of the day.

Miss Clement will give an interesting
talk explaining to the people of Fair

At present there are about forty
members of the local branch of the

Jersey Cow Becomes Football
of Fate and the Laws Delays
Susan, a Jersey cow, who until a
few days ago was chewing her cud
contentedly on the grassy hillocks of
Rlvesvllle, has within the past week
been treated very badly. Susan is a
good girl, of perhaps five summers,
and has for sometime furnished the
table in the home of B. C. Coogle of
Rlvesvllle, with rich milk and cream.
But the tinkling bell which has hung
three or four years will no longer
be heard near the barn of Mr. Coogle,
for Susan has been made the victim
of untortnnatii "

thirsty and she does not like sleeping
out under the moon all night. She
cannot complain of^her position. But
she looks in wonderment at the moon

Ho down and dream of the days of
plenty gone by, and waking, to wond

No tag days will be held, no stamps

fust Three More Days for the
100,000 Bonus Vote Offer
Just three more days and the big
bonuB offer of 100,000 extra votes with
each club of ten subscriptions for one
year will be over. This offer means
much to the members of The West
Virginian's Seven Thousand club and
those who have made up their minds
to win one or the other of the big
prizes are out hustling, resolved to
make the most of the opportunity to
secure thousands of extra votes for
their subscriptions.
Never before have the friends and
readers of The West Virginian been
confronted with such a splendid and
equitable opportunity to turn their
spare time into sure and certain profit
No matter who you are you can secure
a share of the *3,200 in cash and mer
chandise prizes which are to be dis
tributed free on July 8.
Every member of the dub who takes
an active part In the work will receive
either a cash salary or a magnificent
nrize. No matter how much or bow.
little yon do you are sure to get your
share. The prizes wjll be awarded ac
cording to the number of votes secur
ed on both new and renewal subscrip
tions. Every subscription you turn In
will net you so many votes, and on the
evening of July 8 a committee of prom
inent business men of Fairmont and
vicinity will be called in to decide
who is entitled to the awards. To the
One who stands highest a handsome
Overland Six Cylinder touring car will
be awarded absolutely free. To the
two who stand next highest two high
grade pianos will be awarded. Then
in each of the two districts ten mag
nificent prizes will be distributed.
In almost every section there are
thousands of votes still to be secured
for the asking. The fact that you can
not lose makes the proposition inter
esting to all. The West Virginian is
the leading evening newspaper in this
part of We?t Virginia, and you will not
find It hard to writ* up subscriptions
for JL
ment. H? was given the decision In
the case by Justice of the Peace F. M.
Keener of Montana. Barker by spe
cial constable W. T. Bragg, levied on
the happy Susan and like the British
of old in the days of Evangeline In
Acadia, took Susan across the water
to strange lands. She found herself
foraging on the rockribbed mountains
of West Virginia In the district along
the Monong&heU river, at- Montana.
She was to be sold to satisfy the judg
ment of Mr. Barker against Mr. Coo
gle. Mr. Cooglcr who likes butter and
^{syinjunction'wms*^^^^^^^^
stable Bragg then haA a cow on his
hands which he could not sell, for the
[aw forbid. He obligingly took Susaa
back to, Mr. .Coogle. Mr.' Coogle could
dot see wny he Bhould feed a cow in
the keeping of the state. He refused
to accept Susan. Bragg refused to
keep her. Susan was fed and watered
by humane officer Charles Barthalow,
once since she hag been made the vic
tim of litigation. She has lost weight.
If Susan can live on oxygen and
dreamB October, when Intermediate
court convenes again, there is a likll
hood that sometime again she will fur
nish butter and milk for the table 01
some entororlslngr farmer of the Moun
tain State.

HUE THINKS FIRS!
OF PARTY SUCCESS
Wires Instructions to Call
Off Contest Begun in
His Behalf.
; irmimNOTON. June 14.-rnie Her
ald-Dispatch of this city in its Ibbuo
of last night contained the following:
In a telegram directed to his U:e
ISBg^pereonaTana' p51 fQSTifrftfidinf
business associate, Dave Qideon. Wil
liam F. Hitc, late candidate for tho
Republican nomination for United
S'.taes senator, refused . to sanction
the demand made for a recount of Um
votes In a number of countieB. This
demand was made by "Mr. t Hite's
friends, in his absence, wno sought to
protect .his interests at a time when
it appeared that there might be a do
zen or two votes between Mr. Hite and
his nearest competitor, and when ru
mores o! irregularities were rife. Up
on receipt of Mr. Hite's telegram all
| demands for recount were promptly
callod off. The message to Mr. Gid
!eon follows:
Dave Gideon.
Huntington, W. Va.\
Under no circumstances will I
be a party to.any recount. I made
the best fight I could to win. Tho
election of the Republican ticket
in West Virginia is far more Im
portant than the ambition of any
man. Please express my thanks
to those who supported me.
In making this telegram public last
night, Mr. Gideon, after a conference
with a number of Mr. Hite's friends,
Issued the. following supplemental
statement:
"Mr. Hite's telegram is characteris
tic of the man. He entered the field
believing it was for the good of the
party. Ho fought a clean fight, was
true to his promises and his friends.
Now that he is apparently defeated,
he Is the first to make concession and
assure bis successful opponent of his
loyal support and the party he loves
of his continued service. In making
this statement, however, we are con
straint by what appear to be en
tirely Justifiable circumstances, In
making this reservation; while there
shall be no recoiint. we reserve tho
right, if circumstances shall appear to
demand it, or entering contest proceed
ings in certain counties where charg
es of gross irregularities have been
brought before us. We now have
these charges under investigation. If
our investigations seem to Justify
the action, we shall unmistakably act.
If not, the matter will be speedily
ended and we shall be satisfied.
"I can say for Mr. Hite that he will
be a party to no contest which he
might not with perfect freedom and
propriety participate In as a citizen
in the interest of fairness disregard
ing entirely any personal Interest he
might feel In the matter." . c ?
The final figures, as reported by the
election officers throughout tho jstate,
are not yet available, several county
courts not having certified the result
of the official canvass.'
Best information, however, shows
Mr. Sutherland a lead, on unofficial re
tains, of about 1,000 over Mr. Hite.
Judge Robinson has apparently won
the cubernatorial nomination by ap
proximately' one thquMnd .'majority.
