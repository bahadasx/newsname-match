Federal Ownership!
Planks Urged for
Platform Use
French Infantrymen Rushing to the Charge in the Defense of Verdun
Uolted Praia Service
ST. LOUIS, Jim 14. Government
ownership will become a part ot toe
democratic platform If tke efforts of
Frank P. Walsh, chairman of the fed
oral Industrial relations committee,
are successful. Today he urged tho
democratic convention's committee to
Include In tke platform planks de
claring for government ownership of
railroad, telephone and telegraph
lines and coal deposits.
Walsh has also suggested plans for
a. belter distribution of wealth, and a
recovery of public lands claimed by
prlvatu Individuals.
Chairman McCombs called the con
vention to order at 11:30. The dele
gates eoeaed the session by singing
"America." "
Tke Coliseum was overcrowded. As
a result, it was hot and uncomfortable.
Tke Tammany Tiger preparedness
taansr, unfurled by tho New York
lty delegation, failed to elicit ap
plause. Bryan, seated among the other
remits, was. however,- given an ova
lion.
Owing to the beat In the Coliseum,
the delegates were listless. They
seemed anxious to rush proceedings.
Chairman Martin Glynn started his
keynote speech at 1 o'clock. In this,
he defended Wilson's policies, and
called upon the party to -work for
another democratic victory In 1916,
comparing- Wilson in the present situa
tions with Washington, Jefferson and
Mncoln in their crises.
"When tke history of these days
comes to bo written," he concluded,
aas? tke ckildren of tomorrow read
their satloa's story, whoa time skall
have oasaelled all misconception, and
tke year skall kave rendered their
Impartial verdict, one name will shlno
in golden splendor upon tke page that
is blackened with the tale of Europe's
war, one name will represent the
triumph of American princlplos over
tho hosts of darknoBH and. of death.
"That namo will bo tho name of
the great president who has made
democracy proud that ho Is a demo
crat, and made Americans proud that
lie Ih tin American.
"It will bo tho namo of the student
and scholar who has kept his country
true to Its faith in a tlmo that tried
men's seul: tho name of the states
man who has championed; tke oause
of Amorlcsn freedom wherever he
found It, oppressed; the name of the
patriot who has Implanted his coun
try's flag on the highest peak to
which humanity has yet aspired; .the
name that carried, tho torch of pro
grow to victory onco and 'will' carry
It to victory again; the name of Wood
row Wilson, president and president
to bo."
The Wiluon domotiHtratlon following
thin speech lasted fifteen minutes. The
New .Jersey delegation paraded
through tho hall during this.
Cllynn smilingly watched the demon
stration. Bryan excitedly waved a
flag during portions of Glynn's speech.
I (i nil tho crowd choored lustily.
Noar tho end of tho address, a smallJ
donkoy named "Suffrage Plank" bray
ed defiantly. Glynn paused, startled,
and tho delegates laughed!-
Wilson's Flag Day proclamation was
read. Aftor that, routine business was
hurriedly transacted, and a recess, was
taken until 11 a. m. tomorrow in
respect to tho memory of .the later
Thomas l'ence, secretary of the demo
cratic national committee.
