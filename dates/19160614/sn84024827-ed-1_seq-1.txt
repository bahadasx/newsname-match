Suffragettes Bother Him
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. June 13. Charles E.
Hughes today defined his attitude to
ward German American support as one
of "undiluted Americanism" in the
first statement issued since his accep
tance of the Republican nomination
for president he said:
"I st.ited my position very clearly
in my telegram io the convention. My
attitude is one of "ui.dilu'ed American
ism and aryfcody that imports me :s
supporting an out-and- t American
and an out-and-out Ar . 'an policy,
absolutely nothing else."
The nominee's day. a busy one, was
devoted almost exclusively to receiv
ing callers. His visitors were more
numerous than yesterday. There
y-ere so many of them at one time
hat a line was formed aBd they fil
ed past to shake hands aid chnt for
a moment instead of waiting to he
received alone.

GUNNAR QUINAS KILLED, PRE
SUMABLY BY HIS COUNTRY
MEN, IN UPPER LOWELL. OF
FICERS HUNTING COMPANIONS
Gunnar Quinas; a young Finlander,
while on his' way home this morning,
shortly after 1 ''o'clock, was killed by
a bullet wound over the heart. When
the Review went to press the officers
of Btsbee and Lowell were combing
the sides of Jiggerville and Upper
Lowell for several Finlanders who are
known to have goen home about the
time the murder was committed in an
intoxicated condition.
The tragedy occurred just east of
the bridge in Upper LowelL Accord
ing to a Mr. Martin, who lives enarby,
four or five Finlanders came along the
street and were fighting, or using un
usual language. Two of the number,
according to Martin, fought for forty
or fifty feet up the street. A second
later Martin heard two shots, the first
one undoubtedly hitting the mark and
the second going into the air.
Aid was rushed to the man in a very
short time. The others, however, had
disappeared. Quinas was not dead but
died before he reached the Copper
Queen Hospital.
When his effects were examined by
Judge George R. Smith a pocket book
containing an identification card and
the address of William Kuslck. R. F.
D. No. 1, Box 76. Claquit, Minnesota,
as the person to notify in case of
serious accident. The pocket book
albO contained a matter of $150 in
currency. In other pockets he had
some loose change. In his left coat
pocket he carried a thirty two calibre
revolver. In another pocket was a
trip ticket to Chicago. From the
dates on the ticket it was apparent
the man was to have left today for
the east.
Several theories are advanced as a
reason for the crime. First that
Quinas was killed for his money,
and the murderers becoming afraid
to go through his clothes after they
shot him. Another is that the mur
der is the result of a drunken quarrel.
The body was taken to the O. K.
Undertaking company. The Inquest
will be held today before Judge
Smith in Ixtwell.

Wilson's Draft Final.
The "I'resident's on" draft of tlie
platform a single copy will be de
livered by Mr. Caker to Senator
Stone, of Missouri chairman-to-be of

change in it 1 anticipated and Xr.
Baker said he came here as the means
of communicating between the tOm

dent Mr. Wilson wrote hi draft
after frequent consultations with lead
ers at Washington and is said t
have typewritten it himself and sent
the only lOpy to St. Louis by Secre
tary Raker.
Although Mr. Baker declined to
night to disclose the President's plat
form views, these outstanding facts
were learned from his arrival:
The platform nill dwell principally
1 "on peace, preparedness for peace and
I ,Or prosperity."
Won't Impede Justices.
Despite agitation by some Demo

' approves insertion of a plank criticu

Woman suffrage workers will be
recognized but the platform probably
will suggest that they exhaust their
efforts for the ballot in the respective
states, the primary authority for poli
tical qualifications.
