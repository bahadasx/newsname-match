Defends President's Foreign
Policy; Decries "Blood
and Iron"
Coliseum, St. Louis, Mo., June 14.
With the keynote of "Americanism
and Peace, Preparedness and Pros
perity," the Deniocrutic national con
vention began its first session shortly
after noon to-day with not a single
element in sight to disturb the har
monious renomination of President
Wilson and Vice-President Marshall.
When National Chairman McCombs
called the convention to order 12.000
delegates, alternates and spectators
packed the big Coliseum to the roof.
Members of the national committee,
members of President Wilson's Cabi
net and party leaders from nil over
the country had places on the plat
form. Plaster medallions of Washing
ton, Jackson, Jefferson and Cleveland
looked down upon the delegates from
the decorations, which consisted uni
formly of nothing but the American
flag. The only picture of President
Wilson in the hall hung in front of
the speakers' desk, inscribed "America
First."
Vice-President Rooms Wilt
Vice-presidential hooms wilted by
President Wilson's direct word that he
desired the renomination of Vice-
President Marshall were brought to
the convention hall, but only as favor
ite son compliment.v
When National Chairman McComhs
had called the convention to order the
next business was the reading of the
call by Secretary J. Bruce Kremer.
Ex-Goverror Klyim .of New York,
was next with the keynote speech.
Down under the speakers' stand

tary reports of the proceedings in the
hall. All prospect of a fight in the
convention had gone glimmering over
night with William J. Bryan's an
nouncement that he did not propose to
press certain planks before the reso
lutions committee and that he would
make campaign speeches for the
Democratic nominee.
"We have entered this hall as Demo
crats: let us deliberate as Americans."
declared Mr. Glynn in sounding the
keynote.
"It is the business of this conven
tion, representing every section of the
United States, spooking for every
racial strain in America, to send forth
a message to all the world that will
leave no room for doubt."
Reviewing President Wilson's con
duct of foreign affairs, he declared the
President had stood with Washington.
Adams and Grant, who had preserved
peace with honor.
"For vainglory or for selfish pur
pose," he declared, "others may cry
for a policy of blood and iron, but the
President has acted on the belief that
the leader of a naiion who plunges
his people into an unnecessary war.
like Pontius Pilate, vainly washes his
hands of innocent blood while the.
earth quakes and the heavens are
darkened and thousands give up the
ghost.
"If Washington v.as right, if Jeffer
son was right, if Hamilton was right,
then the President is right to-day," he
declared.

Snow-white and soul-white
The good forefather's dream.
Sky-blue and true-blue,
With stars to shine aright.
The gloried guidon of the day,
A shelter through the night. j
Tour flag and my flag,
And oh, how much it holds
Your land and my land
Secure within its folds!
Your heart and my heart

The one flag—the great flag,
The flag for me and you,
Glorified all else beside,
The red and white and blue.
Y'our flag and my flag.
To every star and stripe
The drums beat as hearts beat
And pipers shrilly pipe.
Y'our flag and my flag,
A blessing in the sky
Your hope and my hope.
It never hid a lie.
Home-land and far-land
And half the world around,
Old Glory hears the great salute,
And flutters to the sound.
