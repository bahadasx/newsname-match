W. C. T. -U. Meeting Watson
[ Bland Wedding. New Cen-H
tury Club Met. Mission
ary Meeting.
The last meeting "of the W. C.
T. U. was a full one and with a
good attendance, the meeting being
held in the home of Mrs. O. D.
Black. Mrs. Mattie Denny conduct
ed the meeting and several business
matters were attended to the chief
of which was the celebration of
Jennie Cassedy's birthday, June 9.
Jennie Cassedy originated the flow
er mission which department is such
a means for promoting prohibition.
It has been the custom of this union
to unite with other unions and cele
brate the day by a visit to the Coun
ty Home and making a happy day
for the inmates. Flans were made
for the picnic dinner and each in
mate of the County Home was to
have a bouquet of dowers with an
appropriate card. The program for
this a'ternoon was in charge of
IVIrs. O. D. Black who has charge
of the flower mission and after she
had read appropriate scripture Mrs.
Hattie Parrish offered a prayer that
God would use this ??department to
His glory. Mrs. W. J. Hatcher read
the story of Jennie Cassedy's hie.
She told of having visited her grave
in Louisville, Ky., and spoke of her
substantial monument over the
grave. At the time of her visit to
Louisville, she was stopping next
door to the home of Jennie Cassedy
and had the pleasure of going in it.
Out on the lawn was a peach tree
she h id planted and it was the in
tention of having it perpetuated by
planting the seeds. A paper, "Lights
and shadows of W. C. T. U. flower
mission" was read by Miss Zena
Payne. Mrs. Black gave some
thoughts concerning the work.After
sweet songs the meeting closed with
prayer by Mrs. Hatcher. Awhile
was spent socially and during the
time a variety of sandwiches and
i iced tea was served.
Hon. J. L. Walker has gone to
St. Louis, Mo,, to attend the nation
al convention being a state delegate.
A wedding that was beautiful in
every detail was that of Mr. Avery
Bland and Miss Martha Watson,
the happy event taking place on last
Tuesday evening at 6 o'clock at the
home of the bride's parents, Mr.
and Mrs. S. J. Watson. The wed
ding was a quiet one, being witness
ed only by a few, but was a sweet
and solemn one. The home was
prettily decorated and tiie arriving
guests were greeted by Mr. and
Mrs. J. Neil Lott and were directed
to the parlor by Misses Maud Kick
ersoo^and Virgie Courtney. This
?was the wedding room and was
decorated in white and green.
Promptly at 0 o'clock the wedding
mardi began, played by Prof. John
' Waters and as the notes of .Men
delssohn's march rang out, old, but
ever sweet and new, tiie happy pair
entered, unattended, and the solemn
words that bound these two, '*so
long as you both shall live," were
spoken by Kev. W. S. Brook. The
bride was attired in a traveling suit
of blue taffeta, and carried a lovely
shower-bouquet. After congratula
tions all were seated at dinner, this
being served in two courses and in
the dining room, everything was all
in pink decorations. About seven
o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Bland left in
an automobile for Columbia, where
the}' were to proceed to Black Moun
tain, X. C., to spend their honey
moon. Sincere and cordial interest
has centered in this marriage foi
both of these young people are
popular and the best of good wishes
of every one are wafted to them.
On last Sunday Rev. Brook ap
pointed Messrs. Joseph Wright and
J. A Lolt as head ushers in the
Bap'.i?t church, their chief duty
being to welcome all, he stating
that a cordial handshake to a stran
ger as he entered a church, was
worth more than six, as he departed.
These two were to select four ushers
to serve for a month and those for
Sunday were ([Messrs. W. P. Cas
sell, O. D. Black, Chud Lott and
J. ll. Wright.
Friends and relatives here have
received invitations to the marriage
of Dr. Frank Taylor Lewis to Miss
Ollie Booker of Leesville, La., this
to take place on June -?1. Dr. Lewis
was reared here and there will be

W. C. T. U. Picnic at County
Home.
Friday June ??. is the day that the
Edgeneld county W. C. T. U- has
selected as the occasion for the an
nual picnic at the County Home,
this being the birthday of Jennie
Casseday the founder of the Flower
Mission.
Friday was a lovely day, and
there was the largest number in at
tendance that we have ever pre
viously had on these occasions.
Representatives from the Johnston,
Trenton and Edgetield Unions were
present. We missed the Harmony
and Philippi representation, but
supposed they were unavoidably
detained, as they are always there
when it is possible.
The dinner was served at 12
o'clock to the seventeen inmates,
and to all who came. Mr. and Mrs.
Scurry showed most kindly hospi
tality, and after abundant provision
had been made for those for whom
the day was prepared, we partook
of the remaining feast together.
Ice lemonade and iced tea was
served as well as fruit and candy,
besides the picnic dinner. After
the dinner had been served there
was still an abundance left which
resembled the widow's cruise, in
that the more we took away the
more remained. This was sent in
large boxes to the camp where the
convicts are stationed, and was
enough for two good meals for
hungry men. This was carried by
Mrs. J. D. Mathis and Mrs. J. F.
Atkins of the Trenton Union.
Mrs. J. H. White of Johnston
had conceived the plan of bringing
some growing plants for those who
loved flowers, already planted in
jars and growing with a white rib
j bon card attached.
Mrs. Mathis brought fans for
each one and quilt pieces for the
women. Before going to the chapel
for the religious service those who
who were present enjoyed a season
of s .half hour in singing, accom
panied by Mr. Scurry's tine tenor
and Mr. Henry Dobey and Gordon
Warren. The chapel was nearly
filled with the visitors and inmates
and Mr. J. K. Allen was invited to
conduct the exercises, which he did
very graciously and happily. Miss
Miriam Norris and Mrs. J. H.
White sang solos and the -little
Scurry girls sang a duett, the whole
congregation joining in several
songs together.
Altogether the occasion was a*
delightful one, Mrs. Ida Stevens,
Mr. and Mrs. J. Iv. Allen and Miss
Lena Stevens and Miss Mary Lewis
were there from the Meeting Street
community.
The Farmer Who Was Too Late.
Do you know him-the man who
is always too late? We dare say he
! lives in your neighborhood, and
maybe his farm actually adjoins
your own. He is usually not bard to
tin J, this man isn't; in fact you can
usually tell bis farm the moment
you come in sight of it.
It is likely the first sight to offend
your order-loving sensibilities will
be a crooked fence row with a ten
foot fringe of bushes and briers bor
j dering it, that Mr. Slow-Coach, be
cause of getting behind with his
work, bas found it inconvenient to
?clean up. Then this time of the year
; there'll probably be a patch of
? something with a greenish, bilious
least that closer inspection will show
j to be oats heading out at an average
height of exactly ten inches. You
see, he got behind with the cotton
picking last fall and for this reason
it was impossible for him to insure
his oat crop by planting it in Sep
tember or October. Farther on
there's a field that looks just like a
great mass of hard clods, and, in
fact, thatls about what it is. You
see, he didn't have time to harrow
the hud right after he plowed it,
; and now about the only way the
clods can be broken is with a sledge
hammer. Later in the summer this
field will be adorned with the va
riety of cotton known as "bumble
bee"-another of the fruits of being
behind time.
Of course, we don't suppose there
is anything that ?'an be done for
jgucb a fellow-his ways are "sot;"
but it does seem a pity for him to
set sucli an example to our boys and
girls-the farmers and farm women
to be, doesn't .it?-Progressive
Farmer.
THE PRESS MEETING.
Forty-Second Annual Meeting
in York Pleasant and Profi
table. Beautiful Hospi
tality Abounded.
Some writer has said "AU earth
ly delights are sweeter in expecta
tion than in enjoyment." Bu; thia
is not always true. Knowing that
the town of York had its founding
in the good old primeval days and
that its culture, refinement and in
tellectual life are unsurpassed, the
newspaper makers of South Caroli
na expected to be graciously receiv
ed and entertained in princely fash
ion. But however pleasant this an
ticipation, the realization was far
more delightful.
The newspaper folk from the
eastern, southern and central por
tions of the Slate were met at Ches
ter Wednesday afternoon by a com
mittee of representative business
men from York and when we ar
rived at the station we found all of
the people of the town there to meet
and greet us. All of the homes were
thrown open and as many more
visitors could have been entertained
with ease.
The attendance upon the 1916
meeting of the Press association
was the largest in several years. The
first session was held in the opera
house Wednesday night at 8:30
o'clock, when a formal welcome was
extended to the visitors by Mr. J.
C. Wilborn, the mayor. Upon re
quest of President William Banks,
J. L. Mima responded to the address
of welcome. This was followed by
a practical talk by Mr. J. C. Mc
Auliffe, business manager of the
Augusta Chronicle.
An entire day of pleasure was
provided for Friday. The good peo
pld of York arranged for an auto
mobile excursion to King's Moun
tain battle ground and thence to
Gastonia, N. C. About nine o'clock,
aft jr all had posed for a group pho+
tograph on the steps of the hand
some new court house, the visitors
and a considerable number of York
people boarded about 75 automo
biles. These formed a pageant of
nearly a mile in- length, there being
regular intervals of about 20 paces
between the cars. The route select
ed was the King's Mountain road
which followed the watershed of
the Catawba and Broad rivers. In
passiug out of York by this route
one passes the Episcopal orphanage,
the imposing brick buildings of
which are among the landmarks of
York, having in the early seventies
housed the King's Mountain Milita
ry Academy which was conducted
by Colonel Asbury Coward and
General Michael Jenkins.
The battle of King's Mountain
which was fought October 7, 178'J,
marked the turning point in the
Revolutionary war. The historic
spot upon which it was fought is
near the North Carolina line, but on
the South Carolina side. Two mas
sive granite monuments have been
erected, one by the American peo
ple and one by the national govern
ment. The spot where Capt. Fer
guson, the British commander, fell
is marked and also his grave down
in the ravine. After the party had
explored the battleground they as
sembled in the pavilion, where Mr.
Rion McKissick of the Greenville
News, delivered an instructive ad
dress on the hattie of King's Moun
tain.
About the noon hour the pleasure
seekers resumed their journey, the
objective point now being Gastonia,
N. C. At one o'clock a stop was
made by the way for dinner at Lin
wood college which nestles in the
beautiful foot-hills, where the at
mosphere is balmy, bracing and
ozone laden. The president of the
institution told thc.writer that dur
ing his administration of fourteen
years there had been but little sick
uess. For four years a physician was
not called for the students who
number about 150.
The members of York's entertain
ment committee, who were always
thoughtful and provident, reached
Linwood college in advance of the
pageant and had spread in the col
lege dining roora a royal feast, the
like of which, in both abundance
and variety, one rarely ever sees.
Whether at hone or ou a pleasure
excursion, the beautiful hospitality

"UNCLE" IV WRITES.
Reader of The Advertiser Sixty
Two Years. Down on Mex
icans. V/rites of War
Times.
Dear Advertiser:-I saw in the
Southern Cultivator for June where
there was a man that has been tak
ing that paper continuously for fifty
years, and it put me to thinking
about how long I had been reading
the Edgefield Advertiser. I, if I
live to see the tenth day of this
mota th, will be seventy-two years
old, and my father was taking it
when I can first remember, and I
can safely say that I have been read
ing The Advertiser since I was a
ten-year old boy; not regularly, but
most of the time for sixty-two years.
Well, I am certainly glad to hear
front Russell Wright, again, and I
would reiterate every word be has
to say about mothers. What a
blessing to the girl or boy that bas
a Christian mother, or a man that
has a Christian wife. Must I say
it! 'Tis sad, but true sometimes,
the sons and daughters do not seem
to appreciate the prayers and cares
of their mothers as they ought.
Write again, Bro. Wright.
I also see in the same paper that
Jabez Garnett is not dead or even
captured by the bandits or a Mexi
can widow, but likely to have to go
to some other place to live on ac
count of a twelve-month drought,
but am afraid Pindar (W. J. Ro
chelle) is either captured or hid in a
swamp or an alligator hole, and
I don't blame him if he is hiding,
for I certainly think if I was any
where:^ Texas I would be looking
out for No. 1, for Uncle Sam is cer
tainly very slow in teaching those
Mexicans a lesson that they would
not forget verv soon.
Do I want the United States to
have war? No, I dou't, but if I
h ave ..a corn-on my toe do you think
I'wlfca let a fellow stand on it?
No, sir; but should he accidently
tread on that corn and apoligize, of
course I would readily forgive him;
but should he turn about and step
on that corn again and again I am
inclined to think that the time had
come where patience would cease to
be a virtue, and I would not be sur
prised if there would not be some
battling on the nose done. But I
bear some one say: ' Look here,
old man, you are mighty old to talk
about battling." That is true, but I
am still in the flesh, and am some
what like the Indian who went with
a missionary to the Southern Bap
tist convention, and the missionary
was asked if the Indian could rea
son, and he (the missionary) asked
if any one in the crowd bad a cake
of soap about their person, and one
of the preachers present banded him
a cake of soap, and, it being a nice
looking cake, something new to the
Indian, the missionary gave it to the
Indian and told him to bile it. Ile
bit it and made a very .wry face.
Ile was told to bite it again, but the
Indian shook his head and said:
"Too much of a thing was enough,"
and ibat explains just bow I see the
way those Mexicans are doing, and
'tis about time for them to be given
to understand that the United States
bas had enough of it. I believe
Governor Ferguson of Texas sees it
that way, too, and if the United
Stales will just say to him, we give
you the right to put things in ordei
in Mexico, it would not be long be
fore there would be something do
ing across the Rio Grande.
Well, really I did not intend
writing what I have, but intended
giving an incident that took place
during the Christmas holidays of
18i>2. (This was given birth by
seeing an account of the death of
Col. John S. Mobley in the Tri
weekly Constitution of Atlanta.)
On the 24th of December a good
portion of the Second South Carolina
Cavalry, with some from every reg
iment in Hampton's brigade, broke
camp and went with Gen. J.
E. B. Stuart across the Rapahan
nock river, and was in the enemy's
line by the morning of the 25lh, and
it was about the 28th before the
Yankees knew that Stuart was on a
raid within their lines, and we were
then near the bead of Ocquan Bay.
Col. M. C. Butler was thrown on
the extreme left, and as we came
near to a piece of woods we saw
two yankee videttes in the road
ahead of us, and Col. Muller sent Car
ter Singleton and Frank Chatham lo
Cotton Bloom Received Fror
Carolinian in Georgia.
Editor The Advertiser:-I am ei
closing vou a cotton bloom fror
our farm. I am located in Burk
county. Georgia, twenty miles sout
of Augusta.
Mr. Minis, I will sive the cond
ti on of the crops in our section
The corn crop is h ne. The firs
planted is tasselling and silking
The cotton crop I don't think is s
good. The majority of the crop
are in good shape, but some are ver;
grassy. The wheat crop down her
was very good, but oats were ver
peor. We had. I think, the heavies
rain I ever saw fall June 3.
Wonder where is '"Uncle" T
Morgan? I felt confident that
would bear from him in the last is
sue of The Advertiser, but failed t<
find anything. I fear the grass ha
got him in prison. And Mr. Ro
chelle of Texas-I am anxious t<
know something of bim. I fea:
that the same sentence is passed ot
him that Bro. Iv got. Kow
Bro. Iv and Bro. Rochelle, this i<
no reflection on either of you, for il
my attorney is a hard hitler, I'll re
ceive the same sentence. Baoh one
of you write a lons: letter to Tin
Advertiser, giving the farming con
dition of your section.
A well wishes to The Advertiser.

drive them in, and they went for
them, but after emptying their pis
tols the Yankees still stayed in the
road, and Singleton and Chatham
fell back, and Col. Butler called to
me and a man by the name of John
Bull of Company G to follow him,
and we charged the videttes and
they wheeled their horses and broke,
with Col. Butler, Bull and myself in
close pursuit, but just ahead was a
piece of woods, and as they passed
out on the other side of the woods
they turned to the left, and Col.
Butler and myselfj?ght in behind
them (Bull had gotten behind), and
as soon as we cleared the woods I
saw a batterv of three guns in less
than a hundred yards, and a force
of Yankees (don'tknow how many,
didn't have time to count them; not
over two hundred yards from us,
and formed in a hollow square with
their guns in position of bayonet
against cavalry. The Col. and I
wheeled, and I seem lo hear him
now say 'Run Morgan," and we put
spurs to our horses, and we had
hardly gotten in the woods before
all three pieces of that yankee bat
tery called for us to stop, and hav
ing tired on us with grape shot the
road was strewn with limbs cut oft'
by the grape shot, but the Col. and
I were on the move to a cooler place,
and as we passed a school house (we
then had gotten some distance from
those cannon) I saw a good looking
pistol lying in the road, slowed up
my horse and was in the act of dis
mounting to pick it up and the Col.
called out, what in the h-ll are you
doing, and I told him, and with an
oath he told me to come on. Yes he
would curse you and at the same
time he would tl ie for his men.
After passing the school house we
turned to our right and was then
out of sight of the yankees, and the
Col. said to me this: "Morgan, you
ought to think. I ought not to
have cursed you, but that pistol was
dropped there for the purpose of
getting some one to stop to ?et it,
and I haven't a doubt," says he, "but
what that school house was full of
yankees, but they did not shoot
at von and me because our men were
then near enough to have captured
them. " Yes Col. Butler could think
clearly in the thickest of a fight.
We got back into our lines on the
evening of the 30th, and our Christ
mas frolic was over, but men and
horses were tired and hungry, for,
with the exception of two nights,
we had no sleep, and but little to
eat, but we had been all around the
yankee army, and when they did get
in behind us they gave us a chase,
but after we got within our lines
there were wagons with food for
men and horses, and I remember
very well what I had for supper-a
few hard crackers and a piece of fat
side meat, and I ale it raw. Yes,
sir, raw meat svas often eaten, espe
cially when on the move. How we
went through with what we did is a
mystery to me.
The cavalry sometimes got into
the row and had all the picketing to
do during the winier mouths, but

The Carolina and Northwestern
Railroad.
One of the few railroads in the
State which is not in some way con
nected with the large systems is the
Carolina and Northsvestern which
is operated between Chester,
S. C., and Edgemont, N. C., a total
distance of 130 miles. With Col.
L. T. Nichols of Chester as general
manager, this road is succeeding far
above the average railroad. It was
first built as a narrow gauge road
to Lenoir but. was later made a
standard gauge and the mileage in
creased. The road traverses a splen
did section of country and the
volume of business will steadily in
crease as this section ?3 further de
veloped. It was over the Carolina
and Northwestern that the pleasure
excursion was given by the York
people to the members of the State
Press association last Saturday, and
everything possible was done hy
the officials that would contribute
in any manner to the pleasuie of
the day.
they never knew the hard fighting
the infantry did till 1864, when
most of the cavalry in Virginia
were armed with carbines and fought
as infantry a good deal, so I am told
by those who were in Virginia in
1864, but the Second South Carolina
Cavalry was sent back to South Car
olina in March of that year, and in
one fight on John's Island Company
I lost more men than she had up to
that time during the war in killed
and wounded.

there is only one other that lives in
