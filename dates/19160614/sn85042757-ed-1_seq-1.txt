DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
Convenes in St Louis Today to Nomi
nate President Wilson.
The democratic national convention
will convene in St. Louis today. No
name is mentioned for president except
President Wilson. He has directed all
vital matters for tbe convention even
to helping to write and arrange tbe
platform, cboose tbe man to make tbe
keynote speech and preside as chair
man. Not much has been said thus far as
to whom will get second place on tbe
ticket, but John W. Kern, of Indiana,
has been mentioned but it now seems
most probable tbat Vice-President
Marshall will be again tbe runaing
mate of President Wilson.
Every one of tbe 1,092 delegates that
will make up the convention are either
instructed for or committed to the
nomination of President Wilson.
For the first time in twenty years
William J. Bryan does not go to the
democratic national convention as a
delegate or in some superior position.
He failed to be elected as one of tbe
delegates at large from his home state
of Nebraska, l'bere is some talk that
be will find a way to wage a tight
against tbe Wilson preparedness plan,
bat none of his friends are prepared to
speak for him on tbat point. It is ex
pected that be will support the cam
paign of President Wilson.
The New York delegation will con
sist of over one thousand and will go
on special trains. They are particular
ly desirous of hearing the keynote
speech by former Governor Clynn,
who is to be temporary chairman.
OUie James, of Kentucky, will be tbe
permanent chairman and is expected to
make a speech.
The coliseum will seat 12,000 but the
demand for seats has already tar over
run tbat number. An effort is to be
made to prevent speculation in tickets.
The price for tickets for the week is
$50 or more

BRITISH WAR LORD LOST.
Earl Kitchener and Staff Go Down When
Vessel Is Sunk by Mine.
Monday night of last week the Brit
ish cruiser Hampshire was sunk by a
mine off the Orkney island with Lord
Kitchener and all his staff. Twelve
men floated in on a raft a few days
later and are the only ones savsd from
tbe sunken vessel.
The death of Earl Kitchener was a
severe blow to the British as he was at
the head of the recruiting forces and
was one of the foremost leaders of the
war force of the nation. He had a
long line of distinguished service be
hind him and his death is deeply de
plored by the nation. He was not a
man of engaging personality but had
accomplished so much that he stood
very high in the estimation of the peo
ple as a whole.

Interesting Article in Prospect Touching
These National Characters.
We have made application to a New
Ynrker who has been uersonall.v ac
quainted with both Justice Hughes and j Kressives four years ago
Colonel Koosevelt for an article deline
ating their characters and dispositions,
especially along political lines.
Should we be succes3fui in securing
this article, and SBouId it be written
with the vigor and clearness that we
expect, it will certainly prove very in
teresting reading and will give such an
insight into the public characters of
these two prominent men as will give
Chronicle readers a much better know
ledge of thmn. We have asked that
the writer "cut to the quick" and
neithei' spare nor censure, but to lay
bare the ruling characteristics of these
two men in such a way as will enable
voters to understand the men as they
really are.
We hops to know within two weeks
whether or not we are to be favored
with tbe article requested.
The republican national convention
at Chicago Saturday nominated Associ
ate Justice Chas. E Hughes as its can
didate for president and Chas. W. Fair
banks, of Indiana, as vice presidential
candidate.
Justice Hughes accepted the nomina
tion, tendered his resignation as asso
ciate justice of the United States su
preme eocrt and it was promptly ac
cepted by President Wilson. Mr.
Hughes ga out a brief statement as
to his posit: a and stated that he would
give a fuller statement later.
Chas. W. Fairbanks requested the
convention fa not name bim as vice
c udidate, but he was
3rr?e majority on the first
accepted and will be the
running mate ot Mr. Hughes.
Colonel Roosevelt suggested the
name of Senator Cabot Lodge, of
Massachusetts as a compromize candi
date on whom both conventions might
unite, but both conventions turned
down his suggestion. Mr. Hughes was
nominated on the third ballot with
949 1-2 votes, while Colonel Roosevelt,
whose name had been pre'ented to the
republican convention by Senator
Lodge, received 18 1-2 votes, which
was more than any other of the losing
candidates received. The total vote of
the convention was 987; necessary to a
choice 494.
in the progressive convention no
other name than that ot Koosevelt was
considered and he received the nomina
tion by unanimous consent. When no
tilled he wired that he could not at that
time accept and it the convention re
quired an immediate acceptance his
declination should be accepted as final,
but suggested that his refusal be placed
in the hands of the progressive nation
al committee to be acted upon after
the republican nominee was heard from
on the important issues before the na
tion, and if the progressive committee
should not be satisfied with the utter
ances of Mr. Hughes that then after
due consideration such action could be
taken as was deemed best. The pro
gressive national committee has set
June 25 as the date for meeting to set
tle the nomination question.
John M. 1'arker, of Louisiana, was
chosen vice presidential candidate by
acclamation. Mr. Parker was a formei
democrat and went over to the pro-
He has been
warm personal friend of Colunel
Koosevelt for several years. He made
the race for governor in April and re
ceived nearly 50,000 votes, which is
very unusual as the democratic ticket
in Louisiana seldom has any opposition.
NOT EXPECTED TO KUN.
The opinion prevails very strongly
that the coming utterances of Mr.
Hughes will prove so satisfactory to
the progressives that the party will
support him and no progressive ticket
will be put in the field. The belief is
based on tbe brief statement made
by Mr. Hughes in his telegram of ac
ceptance. The democrats were jubilant when
two nominations were made for presi
dent, but tbe conditional refusal of
Colonel Roosevelt to accept put an
other color on the whole matter and

SV'j
most democrats now see before the
party a hot cpnipaign instead of a
"walkover," as would surely prove the
case with a divided republican vote as
was the case when President Wilson
was elected four years ago by a minor
ity of the popular vote.
NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN.
R. W. Austin, Jease Littleton and H.
Clay Evans made a winning fight at
tht Chicago republican convention to
defeat John J. Gore for the place of
national committeeman. Littleton
was chosen by one vote when the dele
gate from Memphis broke instructions.
The case has been carried to the new
national committee and by it has been
referred to a sub committee for final
adjustment. There seems little likeli
hood of the sub-committee reversing
the action of our delegates.

in progress. There is a large number
of witnesses and it is hard to tell when
the case will be ready for the jury.
