Arriving delegates confessed they
had been simply ptincturftj with

fra(tints who pulled off a stunt
unique in political history
From the Jefferson hotel, along
l ocust at . for the tulle or more to
the convention ha!l. the "suffa" sat
and stood, and just razed in mute
appeal at the delegate* as they walk
ed or rode paat,
Women'a Stunt Effective
Nobody was buttonholed, nor
were therp any speeches en route
it was just stmplv a mile or more
of feminine eves locking at the del
egates— reproachfully. pleadinrlv,
deflantlv. anxiously, or Just looking
-as the delegate chose to regard v
the glances. c
That the stunt was effective was
apparent from the Impression It
made on the delegate*
Noon came, hut therp was no sign
of the convention l>eing called to
order
"It's the most stunid thine I ever
knpw of." remarked Senator Kern,
sitting an' mopnine with the Indi
ana delegation. "to keep us here un

Chairman McCombs began hla
opening speech at 12 43.
The call for the convention was
then read, while the audience sat
and fanned and monped Its brows.
Chairman MeComha read the list
of temporary convention offlclils.

The greatest applause came when

wrenched one of the big standards

around with It
Illinois and Maryland followed
suit, and there was a general lining
up. the strong men of all the dele
gations attempting to root up the
forest of signs.
Olynn stood, arms folded, and
grinned at the noise.
Order was finally restored at
1:34
The cheering and singing had
lasted IT minutes.
Audience Joins In
Glynn cited Instances of where
republican presidents hud avoided
war by arbitration
Glynn would cite each situation
in a few words, and then the audi
fuce got Into the habit of yelling
"And what did he do?"
To which Glynn would shout, a
Ih college veil style: "Me settled

The audience liked this style of
participating in the speech so
much that the.v kept Glynn at his
citations so long that he had to
protest.
