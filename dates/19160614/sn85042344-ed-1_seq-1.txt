WILSON WILL SEND
FIERY NOTE BACK
Situation Growing More In
tense, Outbreaks lie
ported Daily.
WASHINGTON, June IS. Unless
ihe Increasing; seriousness of
conditions In Mexlo forces action,
dispatch of the relv to Ceneral Car
ranza'i demand for withdrawal of
American troops probably will be
delayed until after the St. Louis con
vent Ion because the administration
desire to avoid anv drastic step at
a time when It might appear to be
1 rumpled by political influences.
Secretary Iunsin,- ond his advisers
are said to have given careful con
sideration tJ the possibility that the
sdinmistrat.cn might be charged with
playing politics in dealing with the
problem. The rapid spread of anti
American propaganda in northern
Mexico, however, col-pled with In
crcasingly grave economic conditions,
may take the situation out of their
hands. ... ,
o Predictions cnturexl.
No official wou'J venture a pre
diction tonight as o what might be
expected in the immoliate future. In
common with some i mauls In Mex
ico, they b-lieve altcfst any eventu
ality If. possible with agitators work
ing on the feelings of a people al
ready distrissfd by prolonged dis
orders. It was stated positively that
the Washington government was con
sidering no aggressive action to lie
tal'en on its own notion, but stood
rea.lv to act should assaults on
Americans ot an attack on Cleneral
Pershing's troops force the issue.
A sharp rejoinder Is being pre.
pared to th.. Carra i.i note, it will
repent the determination of Presi
dent Wilson to keep American troops
In Mexico until the Carranza forces
have shown their ability and inten
tion to propfrly pdlce the holder
states. It was also to rebuke the de
facto government forjhe suggestions
and statements in its note question
ing the good faith of the Washington
administration. S one officials re
gard parts of the Mexican note as
insulting to a degree r.ot to be toler
ated and if their noWec is followed,
its author will be called to sharp ac
count. Secretary Danslng has had befors
lUiii a mass of data dealing with the
assertions of fact set up by the Mex
ican note. He experts to be able to
refute most of these statements and
the daily crop of messages from Mex
ico telling of new disturbances will
Kinmlv additional evidence that the
de facto government does not in fact
exercise the control it claims over
the border states.
Pit-pun' for linor(roncy.
Pending the sending of the rep.y
steps have been In progress some days
toward meetin any emergency that
may arise. Conferences between statt.
and navy department officials have
resulted in the formulation of defi
nite plans for the removal of Ameri
cans who would gather in .Mexican
nnrts should a serious outbreak of
anti-American feeling force them to
flee or should there be a clash between
American and Mexican troops. It Is
known, too, that the possibility of call
ing out more state mililia to protect
the border has been the sujeot of
renewed discussion among- officials.
The motives behind the nnti-American
-opnganda and the precise atti
tude of Ciencral Carranza toward the
agitation both are subjects of specu
lation Many officials are convinced
that the de facto government is totter
ing and think Carranza may have sent
his belligerent note with the deliber
ate purpose of provoking the Wash
ington admlnistartion to intervention.
The control of the first chief over
the various elements or his army and
of his civil government manifestly Is
weakening, according to official re
ports. Instances have been reported
where tax collectors sent by the Car
ranza government have been driven
out by state authorities and people.
Decrees have been promulgated by
state governors dealing with matters
that belong, under the Mexican con
stitution, purely to the central gov
ernment. In dealing with the army Carranza
dares not impose duties repugnant t
subordinate officers, according to the
views of some officials, for fear his
orders would be disregarded. While
some of the troops of his own per
sonal following would remain loyal,
it Is said many parts of the army
would obey instructions from their
direct leaders without regard to Car
ranza's wishes.
Keep People In Dark.
The fact that the fit eat bulk of the
Mexican people have only such re
ports of what has happened and
what is happening In the border
states us their lea lor choose to give
them Increases the t'unger of the sit
uation. A demonstration that might
end in bloodshed among foreign resi
dents, It is feared, easily could be
provoked. The consequences proba
bly would be far reaching and the,
Washington government be compelled
to take measures which it has strug
gled for vears to avoid.
President Wilson bus no intention
of clanging his policy unless forced
to do so. If a peaceful way can be
found out of the difficulty presented
by the Carranza nolo and the even
more threatening spread of anti
American feeling In Mexico, that will
be the course pursued. In his treat
ment of the Mexicon problem, Mr.
Wilson Is (aid to have wotked al-
NitA regard to the effect eacn
--tep might have u)m Latin-American
nations generally, hoping to give
them a clear demonstration of the
good laith of the United States in
the declarations of friendship.
ITohlcm l'iin-lH-atttl.
It is known that before the out
break of anti-Amcri unlsm cnmpll-c-itee-
further the prol lem of framing
a replv to the Ca'ranza note, offi
cials were consider-n,; a proposal that
an international commission be
formed to lisouss all n, alters between
the two countries. The treaty of
1S4S, referred to In the Carranza
note, provides fur sue!- a discussion.
With the new and ilarming develop
ments beyond the herder, however,
there seems little portability that such
a course wi'l be followed.
No important dispttches were re
ceived at the war department today.

TULSA TO HONOR
OLD GLORY TODAY
Program at 3 o 'Clock This
Afternoon at Owen
Park.
HISTORIC FLAGS SEEN
Exhibition of Planners From
Dewey's Flagship at
Hotel Tulsa.
THOSIC Americans who proudly
boast of Its protection and who
have in them that latent spark of
patriotism which inflamed in '76
and '61 are called upon to do their
mite today in uiying trlbuto to the
emblem of the United States by fly
ing tho Stars and Stripes from their
homes and offices and by uniting in
the program planned for this, the
national Flag day.
In these turbulent times of war
ami politics, of commerce and ex
pansion, the. president of the United
States has laid special stress upon
tho celebration of Flag day in or
der that the countrymen may not
forget that old (ilory lives.
In accordance with the general
movement over tho country, the lo
cal tlrand Army of the Itepublic,
in co-operation with the Women's
Relief corps anil the O. A. it. aux
iliary, has planned a program to
be given at Owen park at 3 o'clock
this afternoon. Tho program will be
given from the pavilion and facili
ties will bo provided for several
I thousand people. The speaking can
be heard from automobiles parked in
the road.
Itogi-rs to Speak.
Tho Hon. Charles It. ltogers,
prominent Tulsa attorney, will make
I he address of the day, taking as his
theme, "The Flag." A reading will
be given by Mrs. II. W. Meekly. J.
C. Magee, department chaplain of
tho U. A. It. will offer the open
ing prayer. Music will be fur
nished by a mixed quartet and by
(ill's string orchestra. Master Don
ahoo Dangworthy will give a violin
solo.
The pavilion will be appropriately
draped in American flags. It being
tho plan to fairly overwhelm "the
small house with emblems. The
audience will be seated on park
benches and on tho lawn about the
pavilion.
Another interesting feature of
Tulsa's celebration will bo an ex
hibition of twenty of the most val
uable flags in the country. These
are the equipment of the United
States battleship "Olympiu," which
was Admiral Dewey's flagship in the
battle of Manila bay. These twenty
banners, including the proud Stars
and Stripes which reigned through
that memorable fight, are the prop
erty of K. H. tluthrey, who has re
cently moved to this city, and hav
ing read of the approach of Flag
day, generously offered to place them
on exhibition.
Show Hags at Hotel.
The management of Hotel Tulsa,
at which Mr. liuthrey Is a guest, will
co-operate in staging the exhibi
tion by allowing the flags to be
draped over tho balustrade of the
mezzanine floor of the hotel. They
will thus be visible from the lobby
of the hotel and will cover the en
tire balustrade.
The flags which will be exhibited
are those that topped the masts of
the victorious ship in 1898 when
Dewey defeated the Sanish fleet
without the loss of a ship or a man
and which accompanied the admiral
on his subsequent voyage around the
world. After this trip the Olympia
returned to the Boston navy yard,
where it was overhauled and the
flags sold to C. W. Davenport, from
which Mr. Outhrey procured them.
This Is the first time they have
ever been on public exhibition.

AFTKU a close contest with the
Charles M. Schwab interests of
Pittsburgh, J. S. Cosden. pn ..ident of
the Cosden Oil At Has Co., lias finally
closed a deal whereby his company
takes over the very valuable Hill OH
& Una Co. properties in tho south end
of the Cushing field for a considera
tion of I12.UOU.UII0. This announce
ment was made yesterday and sets at
rest the many reports that have been
circulated in rugrrd to the transac
tion. This is the lurgest single oil prop,
erty sale ever made in this country,
topping as it does by JJ, 000. 000 tno
price paid by the Sinclair Oil & lie
fining corporation for the Millikln
properties, which ulso included a re
finery. Oil men generally were glad
.vestirday to lenn that the rich Hill
property had been purchased by a
Tulsa concern.
Cosilt-ii Coming Home.
Ml. Cosden, who has made what Is
probably u record In tins purchase,
is on his way home from thu east
and will arrive in Tulsa today. His
firm was being congratulated on all
sides yesterday, as the Hill property
is generally considered to be the best
single property in the entile countiv.
The property purchased consists of
&.40U acres of leases in township 17-7,
with a daily production of better
than la.UUO barrels a day. Tho prop
erty is in splendid shape and has been
remarkably well band led hy Hupc-rni-teiideut
Thompson, under the guid
ance of William Carnill of Columbus,
Ohio, president und largest slocu
holder, and J". K. .Magee of Tulsa, vice
president and local manager.
It is an ideal property for a refin
ing company to have, as most of It
is well protected and offset wells can
not be drilled by other companies.
It can be drilled as the oil is needed
and is not subject to conditions whicn
changes in the market put other
properties under.
The Cosden company finally got the
property only alter Charles M.
Schwab and others had made a vain
effort to secure it. in making the
purchase. Cosden established u rec
ord for lime. lisl Monday a week
ago he was given a price on it. The
next day he left for New York to
arrange the financial end of the deal.
Monday night he left New York with
all details computed except the ac
tual payment of the mom y and tho
formal transfer of the property,
Kimiliiuiis ProiliiciH.il.
This purchase will give the Cosden
Oil (ias Co. a daily production of
close to thirty thousand barrels a day,
making the concern one ot the foul
largest producing eoinpaniis in the
Mid-Continent field. This is a re
markable record for n company that
was only organized a few months ago.
Stock in tho concern, which has a
par of 15, was quoted yesterday at
15 'i on the curb in New York.
The sale gives the stockholders In
the Hill company a fine "clean up."
President Carnill is not in the best
of health and probably will reliro now
and takes things easy for a while.
He has long held the respect and con
fidence of oil operators and many
telegrams of congratulation were sent
to his home in Columbus yesterday.
Percival K. Magee, vice-president
and Tulsa manager, is entitled to
much credit for the building uu of
the
properly, as it him been almost
a child to him, as he fought through
the Indian agency most of the leases
that now comprise the valuable prop

CTKOOItAD, June 13. (Via Uon
don. 7:22 p. in.) The war office
announcement of today, says that the
retreat of tho Austro-IIungarlan and
Ccrmnn troops ulong the dalloian and
Volhynlan fronts is proceeding so
rapidly that only a small number of
prisoners lias been captured in addi
tion to the previously reported. The

Further north, violent fighting Is
taking place around Tarnopol, where
the Austro-llsngarians, reinforced by

tempts of the Russians to advance in
III direction of Ix-mberg, capital of
Cnlica. Northeast of Tarnopol, near
Vorohievka, positions have changed

ing, while east of Ko.loe, which lies
southwest of Tarnopol, the capture of
a itussiaii advance post is reported by
Vienna.
In Volhynla, northwest und west
of I.utsk, the Itussians have driven
out the Austrians near llojitche and
occupied the town of Torchin, while
west of Kolki, north of I.utsk, tho
Austrians have again repulsed the
Itussians, who were attempting to
cross the Styr river, inflicting heavy
losses on them. The diversion of the
(Iermans on the northern part of the
front apparently has not. yet as
sumed great proportions. The latest
