ST. LOUIS, June 14. With the key
note of "Americanism and Peace, Pre

harmonious renomlnation of Wilson
and Marshal. Only the picture of Wil
son was in front of the speaker's desk
inscribed "America First."
Vice presidential booms wilted
when Wilson's direct word desired

read the roll call and Governor Glynn
delivered the keynote of the meeting.
The prospect of a fight in the con

Glynn's declarations upon Ameri

demonstration. When Tie predicted
the re-election of Wilson the delegates
rose en masse and cheered, with the
band helping, until the convention got
entirely out of hand.

PRESIDENT STOPS AN EFFORT TO

IN CONVENTION
Illy Aiwlitti-1 Prras.1
WASHINGTON, June 14. Efforts
to insert In the Democratic platform
a plank favoring a law to prohibit
federal Judges from leaving the bench
to accept an elective office are not
countenanced by Wilson, who sent
word to the convention he did not
want any petty politics played.
duced this prosperity," he predicted
the re-election of President Wilson.
Taking up our foreign relations that
have been called into emphatic promi
nence by the world-wiae war, the
speaker declared that "We have en
tered this ball as Democrats; we shall
deliberate as Americans."
The policy of neutrality, lie argued, Is
as truly American as the American
flag. For two hundred years neutrality
was a theory; America made it a fact.
"It took Washington and his succes
sors eighty years of endless negotia
tion to win recognition of American
neutrality. And this eighty years of
struggle wove the doctrine of neu-
frailly so closely Into the warp and
woof of our national life that to tear
it out now would unravel the very
threads of our existence." By the
records of history Mr. Glynn main
tained that, if Washington and Lincoln
were right. President Wilson is right.
The neutrality that rrestdent 'Wilson
stands for today wan advocated by
Washington, by Hamilton, by Jeffer
son and by Lincoln.
Lusitania Case
By citing precedents Mr. Glynn
Justified and defended the course of
the President in the Lusitania and
similar incidents. "In ttie face of this
record," he asked, "do Republicans
realize that when they arraign the
policy of. the President of the United
States today they arraign the policy
of Harrison, of Blame, or Lincoln and
of Grant? For the pleasure of crltl-
cising a Democratic President, are
they willing to read out of the Repub
lican party the greatest men the Re
publican party ever had? Are they
willing to say that the Republican
party of today condemns what Hamil
ton did in revolutionary days, what
Lincoln did in Civil War days and
what Grant and Blaine and Harrison
did but yesterday.
"In his policy of peaceful negotia
tions today the President of the
United States follows the example set
him by the greatest presidents which
the Democratio party and the greatest
presidents the Republican party ever
gave this nation."
Curbing ths Trusts"
The laws restraining big business
from stifling competition, the trades
commission act, the movement to fos
ter expansion of American trade, the
close union of economic, commercial
and financial interests between the
United States and the nations of
South America are shown to be legis
lation of the widest benefit. The
Underwood tariff, Mr. Glynn charac-
terized as the fairest and the best of
all we have enacted. Under the pres-
has enjoyed a wonderful era of good
business and good times.
The American's ideals and his aspi
rations served as the basis for the
speaker's opening discussion.
In asking for an endorsement of the
President's peace pulley Mr. Glynn
said:
"For two years the world has been
afire; the civilization that we know
has been torn by the mightiest strug
gle in its history. Sparks from Eu
rope's conflagration nave blazed In
