CASHIER
600D ROADS DAY
Will In Observed by Improving One
of the Village Streets.
The Governor has proclaimed
Tuesday, June 20th, ''Good Roads
Day", and it is fitting that the peo­
ple of every community observe the
day in such manner as to advance
the natiop-wide movement for bet­
ter roads.
A number of the men of our vil­
lage have agreed to devote the day
to the improvement of some part of
the local roads. It has been sug­
gested that the section of the Maple
Hill road lying within the village
limits be the soene of operations.
State Engineer Geo. B. Hughes will
have charge of the work.
The observance of the day will
afford an opportunity for the dis
plap of proper civic spirit and will
put our village in line with progres­
sive communities in this and other
states.
That the movement may not be
an entirely masculine affair it has
been suggested that a committee of
ladies aid by the serving of an after­
noon luuch.
In order that the proper provi­
sions be made for the necessary tools
all who wish to aid in the good
work are invited to report to Engi­
neer Hughes on or before Monday,
the 19th.
The people of Maple Hill are also
invited to help in this work, as the
road to be improved will be of as
much benefit to them as to the peo­
ple of the village. Let's all get
out and show our good will.

GHflHII HAHAIS, ennK COMITY. MIMB., JUNE U. 1916-
Body Found in Temperance River.
The body ot Lou Austen was
found in Temperance River last Sat­
urday by the federal forest rangers.
It will be remembered that Mr. Au­
sten waB drowned last October. He
and a Mr. Dunn were cruising for
the Alger-Smith Co., and were pad­
dling down the river in a canoe,
the canoe capsized and Mr. Dunn
swam ashore, while the body ot Mr.
Austen could not be found, though
a thorough search was made at the
time.
It is' believed that Auston was
stricken with heart failure while
the boat, as Mr. Dunn spoke to liiin
but receiving no answer lie looked
around and Austin was silting up­
right with his paddle still in the wa­
ter, just then he seemed to fall to
one side and the canoe tipped over.
The coroner was notified by tele­
phone Monday and he ordered them
to bury the body.
A Safe-and-Sane Fourth of
July for Minnesota.
Minnesota promises to head the
list of states this year where a
safeand-sane 4th of July was cele­
brated. Public sentiment is de­
veloping in Minnesota along proper
lines. This is shown by the re­
ports received from many commu­
nities in Minnesota that civic and
commerical organizations, church
societies and social organizations are
taking the matter in hand to have
Independence Day observed with­
out needless sacrifice of life, limb
and property.
The modern idea of celebrating
4tli of July is fast eliminating the
old style nerve-racking, noise-mak­
ing celebration with its long roll
of blindness, lockjaw, death and
maiming. With a further devel­
opment of this public sentiment
this plan of observing the anniverary
of signing of the Declaration of In­
dependence will be a thing of the
)ast, especially in Minnesota.
The fire marshal's department is
especially interested in the great
loss by fire which always follows in
the wake of the annual celebration.
For this reason the department ur­
ges all newspapers in the state to
take occasion to boost for a safe-and
sane observance of the day and to
joint out the fact that the splendid
ideals of the Revolutionary period
can be remembered on that day to
promote a wholesome influence and
spread an intelligent appreciation of
what the holiday means without so
mnch sacrifice.
The number ot deaths and acci­
dents on 4th of July is decreasing
in Minnesota, but they should be
eliminated altogether. For this rea­
son the state fire marshal's depart­
ment stands ready to assist in a state­
wide movement to put Minnesota in
a class by itself in this respect in
July, 1916.
Mrs. H. O. Toftey and baby came
down from Tofte on the stage Sat­
urday to receiye medical treatment

returned home Monday.

for forestry and park purposes has

Mr. Cranston, the mail messenger,
made his regular three trips through our

BRITISH ANTARCTIC
EXPLORER IS SAFE
London, June 2. Lieutenant Sir
Ernest Shaekleton. the Antarctic ex­
plorer, has arrived at Port Stanley,
Falkland islands.
The news that Lieutenant Shackle
ton was safe came in a message from
the explorer himself and announced
his arrival at Port Stanley.
The message said his ship, the En­
durance, had been "crushed" in a
Weddell sea ice floe last October, but
that it drifted until midwinter when
he and his party landed on Elephant
island in the South Shetland group.
The explorer left in a small boat
with five men a week later to sum­
mon help, leaving twenty-two men be­
hind. All of them were well, but in a
situation which demands the quickest
possible relief.
The gravest fears had been enter­
tained for the explorer owing to the
absence of news from the Endurance.
.You can always afford something—no
