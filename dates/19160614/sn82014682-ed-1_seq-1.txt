Tcl.'s of Feeling
"Australia will give her last nan
and spend her last shining It need.be
to aid England jtndliei Allies to break.
German militarism tmd never give in
until it is broken, ax:i no matter what
the cost we are determined to fight
until that end U accomplished.", ' -
Thus. was the - sentiment of Aus
tralia described today, by W. W. For
wood ci ; Adelaide, ; member of the
Australian war council and president
of the Associated Chamber of Manu
facturers of Australia, who was. hers
cn the Makura today on his way home
after an extended tour?of the United
States gathering data . on munition
actcries for the Australian.; govern
ment.' ' ; i. :' ' '- " ' ' . ,:
"It is costing Australia 5,000,000 a
week to keep up her end of the war,"
continued Fcrwood. "With a total
population of but 5,000,000 she has al
ready sent 360,000 ?men to the front
and Is prepared to make it 600,000 if
she is called upon, The one idea that
imbues the Commonwealth is to make
a thorough job of the war. Men are
leaving their work and traveling hun
dreds ot miles for an. opportunity to
enlist. My ' sons .volunteered at the
beginning. One of them, a lieutenant,
is 'somewhere in France' and r the
other is in Egypt . : "'r.-"r.rr,
"l want to say that now and in the
future there is room toe much expan
sion of trade between the United
States and Australia, both ways. I am
convinced that the present generation,
at least in. ray country, will refuse to
resume commercial, relations wltfi
Germany after the war We feel that
the money wo have been., paying to
Germany all these years has been
used to prepare her army and navy
for the killing of our own men. There
fore' we feel that1 the opportunity is
ripe for the development of trade with
America, -. . 1 .-. : . . urc.
"My mission in the United States

Germany admiralty ' and : govern

statements - that Great Britain 'won
the North Sea battle of Ma 31 June 1.
In an official cablegram received to
day the German government officially
sets forth the following declaration of
a German" victory: : :;v '" ".
"The German admiralty reports, un
der date of June 7, that English offi
cial jpress telesrama, and others, as
well ; as the conference of - official
English "representatives . In neutral
countries are making a systematic at
tempt to deny the size Of the British
defeat In the sea battle on May 31, and
make believe that the sea battle was
successful for British arms. -
"Thus for instance It Is stated that
the German fleet abandoned and the
British, held the field. Viv---:.:
"To tbif it is stated: . .
;The English main body, during bat
tle'at evening on May 31, was forced
by repeated effective attacks of Ger
man torpedo boats to turn away and
thereafter came " ho more in sight; of
the German ' fojees. y ?
"In spite of superior speed and ap
proach of English battleship squadron
of 12 ships coming from the southern
North Sea. the English main body
neither attempted to get again Into
touch with, our forces in order to con
tinue battle no to join sailing squad
ron In order to annihilate the German
.fleet;' '; ; rf-1 ,Qr--; t
"Further English reixrt is that the
English fleet tried in vain to overtake
the fleeing German -fleet in order to
defeat her before reaching her home
