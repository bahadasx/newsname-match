Richmond, Vn., June 10.?
?The prospects of it "good" ty?
phoid year on account of the
lute spring have largely been
oil's"! by the uusnal rains of the
Irisl ton days ami the situation
throughout the State is one that
calls for unusual precautions lo
prevent thti,spread of thu "smii
liler scourge.Such is the
Substance of a warning issued
today by the Siale Hoard of
Health.
Thus far the board has re?
ceive I comparatively few re-,
ports of an unusual prevalence I
of typhoid in the State. Hut in I
a feu localities apparent out-1
breaks have licetisrod anil are
now under caretul observation,
and a general increase in the
number of cases is expected he
fore .juho lath.
"Sdiiie people si ill i.in Id,
tliinl;." said Health t'ommis
sioiier Williams to,lay, "that '
typhoid originates m water or
in some other mysterious source
ley on I their control. As a
matter of I'aci . typhoid can on
ly be contracted by taking in?
to the body germs thai have
come from the body of seme
other person. Man pollutes
the WIHl'r froili which other
persons may get the germs of
typhoid. Mau puls into fe nl.
through Ins own tilth, the
germs 'hut may destroy nth
eis. Rvfiiii the lly, wliioli is
rightly regarjtetl Iis the most
dangerous insect of tins ?-1 i
in.11e, can only spread typhoid
when man's carelessness has
exposed tilth to the tie s.
"i hi tliis simple and often
lesled basis, the v. hole theory
of typhoid prevention is biased.
Wi? must So dispose of tin- tilth
from the human body that it
cannot reach the food or drink i
of man or he carried to him on |
Hie feet of Hies. This is the
sum and .substance of the
methods of pi even tin ii that litlVOJ
to he applied as circumstances
''Thedaiigers ol human tilth
are complicated by the fact
that unsuspected pursuits Somii
times harbor the germs of t\
I plioiil and discharge them
I regularly or intermittently.
J Most people realize that there
's .langer from an active case
[of typhoid in Ilm home or in
I the neighborhood, but many do
not seem to realize thai there
I is likewise danger front typhoid
'.'carriers' ? people who have
had the disease and have ap?
parently leCVeled but still
carry the germs. In addition,
it seems that a few people who
tic for some reason immune
and have no history of ty phoid
arc also 'carriers'. To guard
I against these, ail human tilth
j must he treated us though it
were infected and must, be dis?
posed of so that it cannot pos?
sibly reach the bodies of
healthy persons. The first
essential is a sanitary outhouse,
regularly used by all members
i of Hie family. The second is a
water-supply, "<> located and
protected that it. cannot be pol?
luted. The third is protection
of food supplies, notably of
' milk, from polluted water, in?
fected persons and Hies.
" There is a dangerous mis
understanding as to the amount
I of infected matter necessary to
cuuso typhoid. Some think the
disease can be spread only
when there is a vast deal of
fill Ii. 'I'llis. of course, met oases
the hazard, but cleanliness, ti>
bo protective, must be absolute.
Fnough germs can bo curried
in a particle of tiltli. scarcely
visible, to infect mi entire com- |
nstmity.'"
