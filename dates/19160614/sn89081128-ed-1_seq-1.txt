VOLUME XXXVII.
The Republicans have four candi
dates for the position of United States
Senator. Moses E. Clapp, the pres
ent Senator, is trying to succeed him
self. In the many questions that have
been up in Congress within the last
year or two Senator Clapp has shown
himself quite independent at times,
and those who do not favor the extreme
preparedness program, that some
hysterical people advocate at the pres
ent time, and who are also satisfied
with Senator Clapp's vote on the "Em
bargo of Arms and Ammunition to
Belligerents" have reason to vote for
Mr. Clapp. Those who believe in a
thorough preparedness and also be
lieve that Senator Clapp has had
enough political favors shown him
will no doubt vote for Frank B. Kel
log. The fight apparently seems to
be between these two. Adolph O.
Eberhart and Charles A. Lindbergh
*Staje the other two candidates and they
seem to have quite a few friends and
it is barely possible that there will be
some surprises.

INTEREST LAGGING
IN STATE POLITICS
NO LEGISLATIVE OR COUNTY
TICKETS TO CONSIDER
AT PRIMARIES
ONLY REAL CONTEST IS RACE
OF REPUBLICANS FOR
U. S. SENATOR
/Be
Before the next issue of the Review
'is published the primary election will
be over and the Democrats and Re
publicans and other political parties
will have made their choice in the selec
tion of candidates for the various offices.
Those who call for the Democratic bal
lot will have less trouble to determine
for whom to vote than those who use
the Republican list. The Democrats
have only to vote for a candidate for
Senator, Governor, and Lieutenant
Governor. For Senator, Alfred J. Da
vis and Daniel W. Lawler are the can
didates. The latter is the better known
of the two and he will no doubt receive
the votes of those who know him and
are satisfied with his political past.
Those who have no time for D. W.
Lawler, and who have not approved
of his political activities in the past
will simply have to vote for A. J. Davis,
whether they know him or of him, or
ifc^. For Governor there are three
candidates—Thomas P. Dwyer, Cy
rus M. King and S. D. Works. Of
these candidates S. D. Works stands
head and shoulders above his com
petitors, in address, in executive ability
and in those other attributes which
a candidate for that office should pos
sess. Cyrus M. King is simply a
candidate for this office, as we are
informed, because some politician in
St. Paul is not friendly to Mr. Works.
Thos. P. Dwyer has been running
for quite a number of offices in Henne
pinf County without landing any and,
although we do not want to say any
thing disparaging against the aspira
tions of Mr. Dwyer for we believe he
is honest and sincere, we hardly think
that he has the requisite ability for
the position of governor. For Lieuten
ant Governor, Severin N. Sorensen
and Julius Thorson are pitted against
each other. Neither one of them is
very well known and it is a toss-up
il wj?fich of the two will receive the sup
•h .port of the Democratic voters.
For Governor, J. A. A. Burnquist
and Samuel G. Iverson are against
each for the Republican nomination.
Mr. Burnquist became Governor through
the death of Governor Hammond and
it is questionable whether he would
ever have been considered as guber
natorial timber had he not become
Governor, so to speak, by accident.
We do not believe that a person should
be nominated and allowed to become
a nominee because he became Gov
»rnor through the death of the Chief
Executive. Mr. Iverson, who is known
all over the length and breadth of the
land as "Sam" Iverson, has been State
Auditor for two terms and has proven
himself a very efficient and painstaking
official. He is very democratic his
ways and is practically running on
his own merits and is not backed by
any political machine or power.
For Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court there are only two that will be
considered here and they are James H.
jpiitm and Albert Schaller. One be
xcause he lives in the southern part of
the State and the other because he
is a German-American. Both appear
on the non-partisan ballot.
i'or Lieutenant Governor on the Re
publican ticket, the adherents of the
fcJLyU.*
-w^*py ^^ir^^^^^^f^f^^^^^^r^f
party have their choice of three, Thom
as Frankson, Dr. J. A Gates and
James A. Peterson. No one of them has
much of an acquaintance over the state,
nor any great call for the nomination
and the choice will no doubt be hit or
miss and will depend a great deal upon
the Twin City vote.
For a change, Julius Schmahl of Red
wood has opposition for the nomination
as Secretary of State, E. K. Sampson
of Worthington being the contender.
Although we do not presume to the posi
tion of political prognosticator, we
believe that the famous Schmahl
"shmile" will be in evidence inthe secre
tary of state's office for a little while
yet, at least.
As far as the congressional, legisla
tive and county tickets are concerned
there will be "nothing doing." Con
gressman Ellsworth has clear sailing
at the primaries and in the legislative
field there are not more than two can
didates for an office, so that the names
of Mueller for Brown county represen
tative and Praxel and Hauser for float
representative will not appear on the
ballot. The same condition obtains
in the county. Judge Ross has no
opposition for judge of probate and there
are only two candidates in the two
city districts for county commissioner,
J. P. Graff against Jos. J. Sperl and John
Henle against Henry Meyer. Herman
Polkow has things his own way in the
western end of the county, no one hav
ing filed against him.
On account of the apparent dearth
of seekers of public office it is not anti
cipated that there will be a great rush
to the polls next Monday and only
a small vote is expected. Within a
week after the primaries, however,
the voter may expect an unusual friend
liness on the part of the candidates
as from then until November 7 the cam
paign will be in full swing.
TODAY IS FLAG DAY
Stars and Stripes Were Adopted As
Emblem of United States
139 Years Ago
June 14 is the anniversary of the
adoption of the Stars and Stripes as
the flag of the United States and the
day has been set apart by Congress
as one which on the colors shall float
from every public building and the
citizens generally are urged to assist
in the observance of the day by dis
playing the flag over home and busi
ness house.
The flag was adopted by Congress
on June 14, 1776, by the following
enactment: "That the flag of the thir
teen United States be thirteen stripes,
alternate red and white that the Union
shall be thirteen stars, white in a blue
field, representing a new constellation."
The number of stars has been increas
ed from time to time by the admis
sion of new states, but the number
of stripes has remained the same from
the beginning, excepting for a short
time.
The act authorizing increasing the
number of stars to correspond with
the number of states was enacted by
Congress April 14, 1818: "That from
and after the Fourth of July next
the flag of the United States be thir
teen horizontal stripes, alternate red
and white that the Union be twenty
stars, white in a blue field, and that
on the admission of a new state into
the Union one star be added to the
union in the flag, and that such addi
tion take effect on the Fourth of July
next succeeding such admission."

LABOR IN DEMAND
IN DAKOTA FIELDS
EMPLOYMENT AGENTS LOOKING
FOR HELP FIND SCARCITY
OF LABOR
CANADIAN WEST IS HARD HIT
THROUGH REMOVAL OF
FOREIGNERS
Representatives of employment
bureaus were in the city several days
of the past week looking over the lo
cal labor market, with a view of en
gaging men for the harvest fields of
North and South Dakota and Mon
tana. Usually these agents do not
make their appearance until later in
the season, but on account of the Euro
pean war it is expected that there will
be a decided shortage in labor during
the coming harvest.
According to one of these agents
the greatest trouble is experienced
in securing men for the Canadian
wheat fields. In former years there
was a large floating population to be
depended upon to move the crops of
the Sascatchewan, but even last year
there was a shortage, so that there was
considerable of a loss on account of
grain rotting in the shocks and on
the ground. Since then conditions
have gone from bad to worse, as most
of the German population has left
the country and but few young, able
bodied men remain to do the regular
farm work, not to speak of the harvest
rush. The employment bureaus are
not worrying greatly about the Cana
dian crop, however, as their main
concern is the moving of the crop of
the Northwest in the states.
Although no fancy prices are offered
for labor as yet, it is expected that
$4.00 a day, with transportation to
the harvest fields thrown in, will not
be an uncommon thing this fall. Sev
eral men were signed up for three
months work, at wages ranging from
$2.75 to $3.75 per day according to
the ability and experience of the appli
cants. The work includes both shock
ing and threshing.
BURGLARS TAP SALOON TILL
Burglars are reported to have entered
the Woratscky saloon on the night from
Saturday to Sunday and to have gotten
away with about $12 from the cash
drawer. Because of the fact that there
was nothing else missing, the police are
of the opinion that the job was done by
some one intimately acquainted with
conditions in the place. There were no
marks on the doors or windows and ac
cess must have been gained by means of
a duplicate key. No clew to the maraud
ers has been found so far.
According to a recent decision handed
down by the state supreme court money
appropriated by a county or township
for the construction or repair of a cer
tain road can not be used for other
purposes. It is usual, however, for
townships to appropriate money under
the general head of road purposes, thus
avoiding the supreme court construc
tion.
Ideal weather brought out the crowd
at last Sunday evening's concert by the
Second Regiment band at German Park.
The green near the band stand was
thronged with visitors and every bench
in the park had its occupants. The
shortage of benches at the park has
caused considerable comment and the
erection of a pavilion, where seats and
tables can be placed for the serving of re
freshments has been talked of by some
city officials who attended the concert

EXPERTS' REPORT
ON WATER SUPPLY
FILTRATION PLANT WILL COME
WHEN CITY OUTGROWS
DEEP WELLS
ENGINEERS TO GIVE COMPLETE
ESTIMATE OF COST OF
FUTURE SUPPLY
By spending approximately $5,500
at the present time, the city water
supply can be made adequate for the
next five years, according to the report
on the water situation submitted to
the city council by the engineers, Pills
bury & Co. of Minneapolis. Their
Mr. Foster was in the city to make a
thorough investigation about a month
ago and upon his investigations the
report is based.
Mr. Foster and members of the light
and water committee visited all the
known supplies in the vicinity at the
time, even considering the availability
of the water of the Cottonwood and
Minnesota rivers with the idea of es
tablishing a filtering plant. Because
of the large investment already made
at the pumping station the experts are.
of the opinion that the city would do
best to continue the present deep well
system. The report says New Ulm
should continue to use the wells so
long as they will furnish a supply of
wholesome water, and when the same
become inadequate to supply the re
quired amount of water that one or
more additional wells should be drill
ed and equipped with efficient pump
ing machinery.
The immediate installation of an
other pump at the station is recommend
ed also the repair of one of the pumps
now not in the best of condition. The
report points out the necessity for
early action, as the summer sea
son is at hand, and should one of the
present/ pumps be disabled for any
considerable time the water service
would be badly crippled and the fire
protection greatly endangered.
Future requirements of the city in
the way of water are based on the
growth of the city in the past and the
amount of water used every year
The necessity of a greater supply in
the near future is pointed out.
Speaking of the source of future
supply the report goes into detail as
to the investigation made, saying
**It is evident that the water supply
must come from one of the two sourc
es, either surface water or underground
-water. The surface supply might be
taken from the Cottonwood river or
the Minnesota river, but either would
of necessity, require treatment and
filtering.
"In this connection investigation
was made of the Minnesotar and the
Cottonwood rivers. In the instance
of the Minnesota river an ample supply
of water could be expected at all sea
sons of the year toad no unusual difficul
ties were noted in the installation
of a suitable filtration plant, using
this river as a source of supply. As
to the Cottonwood river, the volume
of flow during the dry season is so small
as to discourage the consideration of
and had the choice of either standing up
or finding a soft spot in the grass. A
substantial structure providing protec
tion against rain and comfort for the
visitors would no doubt be appreciated
by the public. Complaint has been
made by the management of the band
of the unnecessary noise made by the
youngsters during the concerts and in
order to stop the practice several special
policemen will be on hand next Sunday
evening to keep better order. Next
Sunday evening's program follows:

Balfe
John Wiegand
A. Base
Ernst Reiterer
M. A. Althouse
P. M. Costa
G. Rossini
J. Brahms
Fr. Spindler
C. Bannett
demons, Jr.
this source of supply the unusual and
severe flood conditions here encountered
would also make this stream undesir
able as a source.
"The underground supply would be
obtained from wells or springs. In
this connection a visit was paid the
springs known as the Marschner springs,
located approximately two miles from
the City of New Ulm. At the time
of this visit the flume through which
the water had been conducted to the
mill was broken so that no accurate
estimate of the amount of the flow
could be made. This flow was ex
amined, however, during the previous
summer by Mr. Mueller, superinten
dent of the electric light and water
plant, and from his estimate we find
that the flow of these springs ranges
from 150 to 200 gallons per minute.
To develop this spring, pipe and pump
the water and connect to the present
water systems would involve the ex
penditure of a very considerable sum
of money. A sufficient amount of
land would need to be acquired in or
der that the springs might be protected
against possible surface pollution.
There is little, if any, question but that
wholesome and suitable water in suffi
cient quantities can be obtained from
wells. Owing to the nature of rock
formation in New Ulm it is apparent
that each well will have a limited ca
pacity and the amount of water ob
tained is only limited by the number
of wells, provided that the wells are
located a reasonable distance apart."
PICNIC AT HUNTERS' REST
Junior Pioneers Will Hold Gathering
At Popular Picnic Place
Next Sunday
Invitations have been sent out this
week to all members of the Junior
Pioneer's association and to those who
are eligible to membership for the
annual picnic, which will be held at
Hunters' Rest, the popular picnic place
on the banks of the Cottonwood next
Sunday. It had previously been planned
to arrange the picnic out in Milford,
in order to give those who attend an
opportunity to view the monument
erected near the Henle farm, but it
was thought advisable to chose a more
easily accessible place, as Hunters'
Rest practically is within walking dis
tance of the city.
The gathering will be a private affair
and only the members and their families
are invited. The pioneers themselves,
however, will be regarded as the guests
of the organization. The gathering
will take the form of a basket picnic
and it is not expected that any set
program will be followed out. Each
family is expected to bring their lunch
as only coffee and cream will be served
on the grounds. The picnic will begin
at 1:30.
In the course of the afternoon a busi
ness session of the association will
be held at which time opportunity
will be offered those who are eligible
to membership to join the organiza
tion.
Should any who are Junior Pioneers,
or who are eligible to membership,
fail to receive an invitation the com
mittee in charge is anxious that they
should be notified for it is desired that
everyone connected in any way with
the organization be present and en
joy a pleasant outing.
CATHOLIC SCHOOL GRADUATES
HOLD EXERCISES
Impressive graduation exercises were
held at the Catholic church last Sunday
afternoon, when 33 pupils who had

where a program consisting of music
and songs by the choir was carried out.
Rev. Fr. R. Schlinkert delivered the ad
dress to the graduates and presented
each with a diploma and a gold pin in
remembrance of the class of 1916.

SOCIETY
KNIFE WIELDER IS
ESCAPED CONYIGT
WAS PAROLED FROM AN INDIANA
REFORMATORY BUT TIRED
OF RESTRAINT
COMMITTED BURGLAR AND HAD
BAD CRIMINAL RECORD
AS YOUNGSTER
When the local police arrested Frank
Sloan and a colored man last week on
account of an encounter the two were
having near the coal chutes in the
Northwestern yards, they little thought
that they were making a catch that
might be profitable in the way of a re
ward. The sheriff gave the fellow the
"once over" when the prisoner was
brought to the county jail and decided
from the furtive look in the fellow's
eyes that he had somewhere, some
time "did a turn" in a prison. When
Sloan had sobered up sufficiently to
be interrogated, the fact was pumped
out of him that he had at one time been
committed to a reformatory in the South,
but he steadfastly refused to give the
name of the state he had been committed
from.
The records sent out by several of
the southern reformatories were dug
up and the descriptions of the escaped
prisoners compared with Sloan. When
the latter saw what was going on and
made to realize that he might be ar
raigned on a charge of assault with
ntent to kill, which would send him to
the state penitentiary for a term of
years, he broke down and confessed.
According to his own story he was sent
up from Rockville, Ind., in 1912, wheik.
he was caught in the act of helping
himself to the contents of safe in a-_
lumber office. On account of his youth,
and seemingly good behaviour while*,
an inmate at the Jeffersonville re
formatory he was paroled in April
1915, and given into the custody of a
rancher who had taken an interest
in him. However, it was only a short
while before Sloan was on the war
path once more and after committing
several depredations in the neighbor
hood without getting caught, accumu
lated enough money to buy a new suit
of clothes and get away.
He went straight to the home of
friends in Kansas City, Mo., but soon
found that the reform school officials
were making a quiet search for him.
He dug out for new fields and entered
the employ of the coal contracting com
pany at first working in several towns•
in Kansas and Nebraska and finaUjr
being shipped with the rest of the mixed
gang to Minnesota.
He will now have to go back to the
Indiana reformatory, as the officials
were notified of his whereabouts. Sat
urday the sheriff received a telegram
from the warden of the Jeffersonville
institution, "Hold Frank Sloan will
send officer." The officer arrived Mon
day evening and verified much of the
story as told by Sloan himself. It
seems that the reformatory officials had
information as to his whereabouts
up to the time of his departure to Minne
sota and probably would have let him
go his way had he not messed up things
by attacking the negro with a knife.
Although Sloan claims that the black
man started the trouble, other members,
of the coal heaving gang say that the
white man drew the knife without,
serious provocation and was the at*
tacking party. The negro was dis
charged from custody after being given
a chance to sleep off his jag at the coun
ty jail.
There is a standing reward of $25
for the apprehension of an escaped re
formatory prisoner and this will no
doubt be paid over to the sheriff and
his deputy.
TRAINS CHANGE TIME SUNDAY
Chamges in the tine table of the North
western line are expected by local officials
before the end of the week. It is re
ported from the eastern end of the
division that the change planned about
two weeks ago will go into effect as an
nounced at that time, which means that
the Chicago Flyer will be extended
through to Tracy, going west through
New Ulm in the forenoon and returning
about 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
It is reported that the service via St..
Peter and Kasota will not be disturbed*
to any great extent, but there will be a
change in the running time of the trains
now in service. The changes will go
into effect next Sunday.
