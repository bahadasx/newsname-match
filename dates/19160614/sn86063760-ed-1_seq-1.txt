ROOSEVELT NOMINATED
BY PROGRESSIVE PARTY
Roosevelt Tentatively Refuses, Await
ing More Explicit Declaration . of
Views on Vital issues by Hughes
Before Final Decision.-Progres
sives Name John M. Parker of
Louisiana For Vice President.
Chicago.-Charles E. Hughes and
Theodore Roosevelt. both of New
York, were nominated for President
by the Republican and Progressive
conventions at 12:49 and 12:47 o'clock
Saturday. respectively, the Roosevelt
nomination beating the Hughes nomi
nation by exactly two minutes.
Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana
was nominated- for Vice President on
the Republican ticket and John M.
Parker of Louisiana on the Progres
sive. The Hughes nomination was
made on the third ballot of the con
vention, the Roosevelt nomination by
acclamation.
Colonel Roosevelt sent a tentative
declination of the nomination, with
the understanding that it was to stand
if Hughes turned out to be sound on
the issues of Americanism and pre
paredness, and that if Hughes turned
out to be pactifistic, pussy-footed, or
pro-German he would accept and
make the race as the Progressive can
didate.
Justice Hughes broke all records by
acceptingkhe nomination by telegraph,
without waiting for a formal notifica
tion by the regularly appointed com
mittee, and declared his position not 1
only on the issues regarded by Col
onel Roosevelt as the test issues, but I
also on the other principal quesLions
raised by the Republican platform. 1
For a long time a third telegram, this
one from Mr. Fairbanks declining the
Vice Presidential nomination, was an
ticipated, because he already had sent
a private one to that effect, but, in
stead, he accepted over the telephone
The Conference Committee scheme
tailed because the Republicans would
name no candidate. At the last minute,
after every effort to induce them to do
so had proved Ineffective, Colonel
Roosevelt himself proposed union on
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts.
The two Conference Committees sc
reported, but the Progressive Conven
tion laid the telegram on the table
and the Republicans paid no attention
to it.
The nominating ballot showed this
count:
Hughes 949 1-2; Roosevelt 18 1-2;
Lodge 7; Du Pont 5; Weeks 3; La-j
Follette 3; absent 1. Total 987.

Leaders Seen Satisfied.
At 2:01 p. m. the convention ad
journed. There were expressions of~
harmony frqm all the leaders and
among the delegates. The delegations
which on the final ballot had cast
votes for others than Mr. Hughes
made statements declaring their bo
alty to the nominees.
"Six months ago," said Chairman
Hilles of the National Committee, "I
said a nominee would be born in the
convention, and he was."
"I am very much pleased, of course,"
said Mr. Hitchcock. "It means a re
united Republican party and victory
In November."
FavorIte Sons WIthdrew.
When the convention began busi
ness shortly before noon the with
drawal of the favorite sons was an
nounced one after another and the
votes began flopping into the Hughes
column in solid blocks so rapidly that
the nomination plainly was assured
before the roll call had gone five1
states- When It got to Colorado the
drift was so apparent that a proposal
to make it unanimous was made. but
Chairman Harding ruled that the bal
loting should take its regular course.
Greeted By Yells.I
Each addition to the Hughes col
umn was greeted by yells of exulta
tion from the rapidly accumulating
Hughes delegates and steadily state by
state the votes piled up until New
Jersey carried it past the required
494 and the remainder was only a
formality.
In rapid succession as the vote went
on Du Pont was withdrawn by' Del-'
aware and his solid block was cast!
tor Hughes; Illinois withdrew Sher
man; Ohio withdrew Burton; Iowa
withdrew Cummins; New York with
drew Root; Massachusetts withdrewf
Weeks. Practically all of these new
votes were cast for Hughes, only a
few remaining in compliment to the
favorite sons who brought them.
Not a Nation of Singers.
In this country, though we have pro,
hnced many fine voices, we have never
itome a nation of singers. There are,
.1 Is true, In most of the leading cities,
shoral societies, but the singing of
large groups of people is ecmparative
Ly uncommon among us. Here is a1
amatter for regret, for among all large
bodies of singers where there has been
more or lees training the effect is beau
iful and inspiring. In fact, there atg
tow things in music more impressive
than the singing of hundreds of

Burton Goes to Fairbanks.
With the end of the balloting for
the presidential nomination and the
)fficial announcement the balloting
or Vice President began. There were
;ome surprise when Governor Willis
)f Ohio withdrew .Burton's name and
st the whole block of Ohio votes for
'airbanks.
After Chairman Harding had offi
ally announced the nomination of
'arbanks. the usual resolutions. were
passed. Chairman Hilles called a
meeting of the new National commit
tee for organization, and the conven
ion adjourned.
Notable Convention.
The convention was notable in po
tical history for many things. A
nan who had steadfastly refused to
eek the nomination had been chosen;
;t was the first Republican convention
snce 1888 which had been forced to
take more than one ballot to agree
ipon a candidate. and it had been
narked by a lack of riotous demon
tration and nervous enthusiasm
which hitherto had been a feature
f such gatherings. It did not touch
y of the existing records for sus
ained demonstrations, but despite
the fact that it was wholly and decid
ily "unbossed;" it moved with a pre
ision and quietness which had not
een equalled since the McKinley con
rention in Philadelphia.

Since the present offensive was
started one week ago, the Russians
have taken about 108,000 prisoners.
"Our offensive in Volhynia, Galicia
and Bukowina, have obtained fresh
successes. The enemy armies con
tinue to suffer enormous losses in
prisoners alone.
"The fierce attacks or our troops
are throwing into our hands thous
ands upon thousands of prisoners and
booty of all kinds, the exact estima
tion of which is as yet impossible.
"For instance, in a single sector on
the enemy front we captured 21
searchlights, two convoys, 29 field
kitchens, 47 trains of machine guns,
12,000 poods of barbedwire. (a pood
is equivalent to 36 pounds) 1,000 con
crete planks, 7,000,000 cubes of con
crete, 10,000 pounds of coal, enormous
depots of ammunition and quantities
of arms and other material.
"In another sector we captured 30,
000 rifle cartridges, 300 boxes of ma
chine gun cartridges, 200 boxes of
hand grenadtes, 1,000 rifles, four ma
chine guns ,two range finders and a
Norton portable pump for the extrac

"The capture of such enormous
war materials prepared by the enemy
for various operations affords proof
of how opportune was our coup.
"The Turks in the Caucasus region
repeated attacks on our positions in
the Platana region but were repulsed
with heavy losses, abandoning in

Anti-Tipping Act to be Enforced.
Inspectors of the state department
of agriculture will be instructed to
strictly enforce the anti-tipping act
which was passed by the 1915 session
of the general assembly. No pro
vision was made for the enforcement
of the law.
Recently members of the T. P. A.
made complaint to A. E. Hill, solici
tor, as to violations of the law. Solici
tor Hill took the matter up with Com
missioner Watson and also asked for
an opinion from the attorney general
as to the right of the inspectors to
enforce the anti-tipping law. Acting
upon the opinion of the attorney gen
eral, Commissioner Watson stated
that the law will be enforced.
The following is the opinion of the
attorney general, which was given
upon request of Solicitor Hill: "I
have received copy of your letter of
May 30 to the Hon. E. J. Watson, com
missioner of agriclZ4ture, commerce
and industries, with reference to the
enforcement of the anti-tipping law,
passed by the general assembly in
1915, and, in reference thereto, I beg
to say that the duties and authority
imposed upon the above named com
missioner are broad enough to justify
him in requiring the inspectors em
ployed by him to report and prosecute
violations-of the above law.
"While this duty is not specifically
imposed upon the department of agri
culture, commerce and industries, all
law officers are charged with seeing
to the enforcement of the laws and
it would not be beyond the power of
the commissioner to require the in
spectors to look after this matter."
Peeples Defines Weekly Pay Day Law.
It was not contemplated, in the
Opinion of Thomas H. Peeples, attor
ney general, that the weekly pay day
for corporations should be a movable
feast; furthermore the payment o1
wages is for money earned during the
preceding calendar week and not foi
the seven days immediately' preceding
the pay day.
This opinion was rendered in April
to Commissioner Watson and wat
duplicated to the Pacolet Manufactur
ing Company. - The letter in part fol
lows:
"It can not have been intended that
the corporations shall pay wages of
every seven days that the wages ma3
be earned, as the act requires a regu
lar pay day once in every week, and
not a movable pay day, according t<
the time the employes may have actu
ally worked.
"I am, therefore, of the opinior
that the proper construction of thi
act requires the corporations to fix
certain day in every week upor
which day they will pay the wage:
earned during the preceding calendal
week. While it would be more con
venient to the corporations- to have
only four pay days during a period of
30 or 31 days, this would nt, in m3
opinion, meet the requirements of the
statute."
Right to Condemn City Waterworks
Thos. H. Peeples, attorney general
in an opinion just filed held that ac1
No. 220 gives the city of Greenville
"authority to condemn waterworks
with the pertinent reservoirs and pip
lines situate without the city limits foi
municipal purposes.." The opinioI
was given upon request of Wilton H
Earle, senator from Greenville county
The opinion in full follows:
"As requested in your letter of the
29th of May I have examined act No
220 to amend section 3015, volume 1
code of 1912, approved March 6, 1916
and am of the opinion that it givee
the city of Greenville authority to con
demn waterworks with the pertineni
reservoirs and pipe lines situate with
out the city limits for municipal pur
poses. ,
"In this connection I will call youm
attention to the cases of Murphy vs
Kelley, 76 N. Y. 488, and Meaussler vs
St. Louis, 205 Mo. 556, 103 S. W. 1034
"There is no doubt that such exer
lse of the rightof eminent domals
would be for a public purpose, and, in
my opinion, this amendment to sec
tion 3015 of the civil code is broad
enough to authorize the exercise 01
the right of eminent domain by the
municipal authorities.

Doings and Happenings That Mark O

Columbia. r
Special from Washington. - Con. p:
-gressman Lever is planning to make e:
an experiment in rural community
building smewhere in South Carolina, it
beginning this fall. The effort, while Y
building a community spirit, will dem- ih
onstrate the practical value for farm- s
ers of the legislation for rural credits, u
standardization of warehouse receipts, it
and cotton standards in security com
munity co-operation. A fine graderof- e
cotton will be used, and Mr. Lever f(
hopes to have the services of govern- v
ment experts in getting the work si
done. .
His purpose is to make the work n
permanent in the community, and it F
may be several years before the re- 12
sults expected are attained. He ex tl
pressed the belief that the commun- 8
ity he proposes will be an example n
of value to the South as well as to his t4
own state, and his hope is that a model 1
rural community may be established, a
with the people co-operating along all
lines that make for progress and bet
terment.
He will choose some section where t
the people are homogeneous, and call b
a meeting. He will ask them for the b
next year to prepare their land and E
use the cottonseed under the direc- r
tion of a demonstrator. It Is prob- P
able that the upland long staple will e
be used. a
The community idea .,will develop
along the following ines: The work a
of the community with the cotton un- h
der this plan pre-supposes a commun
ity gin, which means a gin co-opera- e
tively owned. It pre-supposes, too,
community buying and mixing of fer
tilizer. A soil survey expert will show e
the needs of the soils and fertilizer
will be used which applies especially t
there. Community selling will be nec
essary. Mr. Lever said that selling is
a feature of agriculture that farmers 0
know less about than any other fea- d
'ture. 1
Mr. Lever entered in a criticism
that has obtained in the South in
which farmers sell to buyers without
knowing the real value of their cot
ton. "Four-fifths of the cotton of the b
South is sold that way. The big a
'I buyers have given small owners of d
stores in small towns the quotation d
on which to purchase the staple. ~
These people are not fully acquainted ~
with the grades. The cotton growers
are not and the result is that the
price paid often is not what the farm
ers should get-.t
This leads to a small communIty1
warehouse, owned, controlled and
operated by the community on the*
safest basis. It dan be operated in
conjunction with the Federal system. a
Mr. Lever wants an expert cotton
grader to stay with the people for a
time to demonstrate the values of a
~their cotton to them. Not only by~
this method will much higher cotton*
be put on the market for its realt
value but they will be taught the va
rious grades of cotton so they will
know what they are selling when no
expert is around.
"That community will probably sell
1.000 bales," said Mr. Lecer, in fol
lowing the outline of his plans. "We've
got to have competition in buying cot-:c
ton. There is practically no compe-c
tition now. The thing to be done Ish
to make a market day for buying si
cotton and let the fact be advertised
so the buyers can be on hand at a: a
given time. Let us say that on a cer
tan day we will sell 50 bales. That:
will interest the mills, and they will
feel .justified in sending a buyer on'
the ground for the occaso. Let
them advertise the quality of the cot- c
ton, say that it grades up to middling
fair, with a length of staple of oner
and a quarter.'
That, in substance, is Mr. Lever's
Idea, for the beginning of the com
munity work. 0
"If you can demonstrate to the farm
er that he can make money by co
operation in growing cotton you will
have instliied In him a spirit of co- c
operation and you can follow it out s
in other agricultural activities and in Ifc

RIENDSHIP THAT RINGS TRUE
.ways a Condition That Requires
Thorough Understanding and
Complete Sympathy.
Some acquaintances will never ripen
to true friendship because the com
on bond of union, the thorough un
erstanding and the complete sym
ithy are lacking.
An acquaintance begun in child
Dod will ripen Into friendship if the
ildren develop mutual interest in a
ymmon cause of study or pleasure. If
Issimilar tastes and unlike impulses
evelop the children will grow apart,
nee each of us tends.toward certain
nters of association.
Money cannot buy us friends. It
lten purchases apparent friendship,
at when the wealth goes that which
sed vs friendship vanishes also.
Friendship must -be distinguished 4
-m that sentimental feeling which Is
> common among young girls. This
idiculous fascination, which ex
resses itself in extravagant terms of
adearment, is very fickle.
As soon as It finds faults in one idol
transfers its affection to another.
outh has yet to learn that perfection
i human nature does not exist. The
msible man or woman does not set
p an ideal of friendship so high that
must be shattered.
Friends influence us for good or
vil. Unfortunately we cevn guide- the
>rmation of our friendships only to a
ery limited extent, either for our
elves or for our children.
Friendship springs up and grows
aturally; it cannot be planted at will.
bolish friendships are often formed

ust simply tolerate them and trust
the awakening of common sense to.

Wire in Great Demand.
Particularly for the transmission of 1

0,000,000 pounds of conductor of this i
aracter. The aluminum has great
iciency, together with lightness,

bly long spans, which Is not so with 1
e conductor made alone of alumi- 1

"City Healthier Than Farm."

"In New York and Massachusetts
irticularly, the city is a healthier
ace to live than the country." Doctor '
riley said. "The cities of New York '
ed Massachusetts are taking better
ie of their citizens than the coun
y is, and I am inclined to believe
at the unfavorable situation in the
iral sections is due more to lack ofj
nitary conveniences and appliances
an it is to the effect of the climnate !

Teaching Cops PoIteness.
Commissione Wood has a plan to
emore the sulphur from the atmnos
here, says the New York Times. He
as just organized a squad of uni
rmned professors of ethical culture,
rith trafmc policemen. The commis
loner has discovered that the cops in'
Ler controversies with chauffeurs of
en go a bit beyond the bounds of par.
ar conversation. Instead of the po
Leeman saying "--" to the chauf.
eur, and the chauffeur replying in
te manner, it is planned to have the
lcemen say softly: "Pardon me, if
ou will please turn that automobile
f yours around and go west through
hat other street, it will relieve me
f considerable worry." And the
hauffeur is expected to reply: "All
ight, dear sir. You are absolutely
orrect. I shall do as you suggest."
'o make it easier for them, the pro

Welding Platinum.
A new process has been recently de
sed In England for the welding of
atinum contacts on springs, thus ef
ting a saving in the amount of plati
imn used. Essentially, the main fea
ire of the process is the placing of a
tin coating of copperplate on the
atinum, which not only facilitates
e task, but also reduces the welding
rrent .necessary. An automatic weld
g machine is used in the process. It
kes a strip of platinum sheet or a
mii of platinum wire, depending on
hether a flat or pointed contact is de
red, and deposits a piece of platinum
the proper size on the spring and -
>lds tn postion durng the weldng
eration. The welded contact Is flat.
