AFTER THE BALL
The candidates all waltzed around
the county lively and can now count
the cost; while a few are happy, most
of them have broken hearts and hopes
such is life. The. eleventh-hour
politics with its two autos proved to
be a boomerang so mote it be. My
friends are not alj dead yet and as
this is my last race, I want to take
off my hat and thank every one of
them from the bottom of my heart for
fitting so steadily in the boat. The
old ship has made the landing in good
shape, thanks to them. '

A NEW HIGHWAY
AROUND THE LAKE
Would Open Up a Fine Section of the
County and Shorten Distance
to Weirsdale ' -
Among the things advocated"" by
Commissioner-elect Joe Davis, of Sum
merfield, is a - hard-surfaced road
around the north and west ides of
Lake Weir to connect with the Dixie
Highway at Weirsdale. The exact
route of the road Mr. Davis is will
ing to have decided by the people of
the precincts immediately concerned,
but in any event the proposed high
way will shorten the distance to
Weirsdale and points south.. It would
probably shorten the distance between
Ocala and the south side - of the lakfc
by about five miles, and would make
more accessible considerable terri
tory in one of the most attractive
sections in the county.
With the building of this proposed
road, there would be a hard-surfac
ed highway on all sides of the lake,
and as each side is different a" most
attractive route for motor trips would
be opened and the building up of all
points would follow. :
The road has been contemplated for
some time, and its cempleiton would
be more than welcomed.
A PLEASANT EVENT
A barbecue was given last evening
to the members of the young men's
class and their friends of the Methodist-
Sunday school at the home of
Mr. lid Mrs. Charles B. Howell of
LowrelL Guests were conveyed in au
tomobiles and on arriving each one
took part in such games and music as
were befitting to the occasion. At
the proper hour all the guests were
seated in a circle, quaint fashion, us
ing orange boxes as individual tables,
making a strikingly unique effect.
The feast consisted of chicken, rice
and seasoning palatable to the taste
ot the most critical. Each one had
brought with them an appetite such
as only healthy beings could possess,
hence justice was done to all the
viands, after which games and music
filled out the" evening. At the hour
of 11 o'clock the guests bid host and
hostess good-night.

President Allison of the Dixie High

"I am very glad inded to note that

This'is what Judge M. M. Allison

headquarters of the Dixie Highway in
Chattanooga, Judge Allison, after re
lating some of the results recently
obtained, says:
"These results ; have not merely
'happened,' but they have been
brought about by hard persistent
work on the part of the active repre
sentatives of the various counties and
the Dixie Highway Association. They
should be sufficient incentive. to every
county to bring their section of the
highway, up to the highest standard
of perfection, and to see to it that not
only the section of the highway thru
their county, but" that of the adjoin-

they will use in rebuilding thirty
