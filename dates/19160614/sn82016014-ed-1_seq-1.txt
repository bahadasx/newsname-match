the keynote of "Americanism and
Peace. Preparedness and Prosperity."
the Democratic national convention
began its first session shortly utter
noon today with not a single element
in sight to disturb the harmonious re
nomination of President Wilson and
Vice President Marshall.
When National Chairman McComDS
called the convention to order. 12,001)
delegates, alternates and spectators
packed the bis Coliseum to the root.
Members of the national committee
and of President Wilson's cabinet and
party leaders from all over the coun
try had places on the platform.
Plaster medallions of Washington,
Jackson. Jefferson and Cleveland
looked down upon the deleg iles iro.u
the decorations which consisted um
lormJy of American flags. The ..nly
picture of President Wilson in the hall
hung in front of the speakers desk
and was inscribed - America first.
Vice presidential booms, wilted by
President Wilson's direct word that he
desired the renomination of Vice
President Marshall, were brought to
the convention hall, but only as favor
ite son compliments. When National
r-hairmnn MeCombs had called tne
convention to order the next business
was the reading of the call Dy secre
tary J Bruce Kremer. Former Gover
nor Glynn of New York was next with
the keynote speech.
Under the speaker's stand direct
telephone and telegraph wires to the
White House carried momentary re
ports of the proceedings in the hall,
liryan Will .Make Campaign
All prospect of a fight in the con
vention had gone glimmering over
nieht with William J. Bryan's an
nouncement that he did not propose
to press certain planks before the
resolution committee and that he
would make campaign speeches for
the Democratic nominee.
"We have entered this hall as Demo
crats, let us deliberate as Americans,"
declared Mr. Glynn in sounding the
kevnote.
"It is the business of this conven
tion, representing every section of the
United States and speaking for every
racial "train in America, to send forth
a message to all the world that will
lfcve no room for doubt.
Reviewing President Wilson's con
duct of foreign affairs he declared the
nresident had preserved peace witn
honor.
"For vain glory or for selfish pur-
nose." he declared, "others may cry
for a policy of blood and iron, but the
piesident has acted on the belief that
the leader of a nation who plunges
his people into an unnecessary war,
like Pontius Pilate vainly washes his
hands of innocent blood while the
e.-irth quakes and the heavens ire
darkened and thousands give up the
ghost.
"If Washington was right, if Jeffer
son was right, if Hamilton was right,
then the president is right today." he
declared.
Carpenters Still at Work.
Carpenters were beating a tattoo on
finishing touches upon the hall as the
delegates tiled in.
The delegates and alternates had
seats on the main floor, arranged like
a huge oblong wedge, with the broad
side toward the platform. Their seats
were jammed together, much more
congested than at either convention
in Chicago. Moving picture machines
and cameras were planted at every
vantage point Because of the heat
under the glary skylight, many of the
delegates removed their coats and it
promised to become a coatless crowd.
The Texas delegation tossed miniature
souvenir bales of cotton to the gal
leries. Just before the convention was
called to order, the band struck up
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,"
and the delegates rose, joining in the
chorus and waving American flags.
"Dixie" brought a roar, interrupted
with rebel yells. William J, Bryan
was given an ovation as he took his
seat in the press section. The ap
plause started in the galleries and
spread to the delegates. Brvan smiled
his appreciation and got out his pen
cil and prepared to work. A "Woody
Tiger" was sent to Chairman Mc
Combs's desk by a New York delegate.
Open With Patriotic Songs.
. Chairman MeCombs took his place
at his desk at 12:30 amid cheers and
applause. A few thumps of his gavel
on a wooden sounding board quickly
secured order. One verse of "Amer
ica" was then sung by the entire
crowd, with tossing flags keeping the
rhythm. This was followed by one
verse of the "Star Spangled Banner "
The Rev. James W. Lee. Methodist
Episcopal clergyman of St. Louis, read
a prayer.
Denounce Cse of Militia.
Denunciation of the use. of the mi
litia and armed guards against or

Doyle demanded that Hugh Farrelly
of Chanute, Kansas, take the plat
form and explain the action of Presi

New York, June 14. Railway man
agers and officials of railway unions
who have been discussing wages and
hours of work believed that this would
be the last day of their conference and
that it would end in a deadlock. The
conference has been in session most
of the time since June 1 and is esti
mated to have cost upward of
J100.000.
More than 800 delegates from the
unions of employees, representing
350,000 workers, have attended. The
union men have rejected flatly a pro
posal by the managers that no man
shall be paid twice for the same time,
although his day may be divided be
tween two classes of work. Some of
the 105 questions submitted by the
men to the managers remained to be
answered today. After this it was ex
pected the conference would adjourn.
Labor leaders said the next step
would be to submit to the unions a
referendum vote as to whether the
officials should be empowered to ex
ercise their own judgment in calling a
strike. If that were decided in the af
firmative another conference of the
managers would be called.

New York. June 14. Reports today
that Theodore Roosevelt was seriously

has been experiencing couching spells
recently and in a statement late to
day regarding an attack of pain, while
he was at a pier this morning await-
i ng the arrival of his son Kermit from

America, the colonel explained
that this coughing probably had

I have probably strained a ligament.
It is ridiculous but painful, so. like

The former president left the pier
in an automobile with his family but
did not retire to his room at the hotel
where he is stopping- He appeared in
the public dining room with Mrs.
Roosevelt and others and held a po

who was chairman of the national

Conclusion: "Elephant Is
Dead; Moose Is Dead!"
I Coliseum. St. Louis. June 14.
In callins the Democratic nati-mstf
convention to order at noon today
Chairman William F. MeCombs of the
Democratic National committee spoke
, as follows:
"Ladi-?s and gentlemen of the con
tention: We are in an atmosphere of
j victory. We have no feeling of guess
but a spirit of certainty. We meet to
i celebrate the marvelous achievements
. of the Democratic party since it came
: into power and to place a milestone
upon the path of its future success.
"Over two thousand years ago, an
! old slave related the fable of the frog
I who wanted to grow to the size of an
; elephant. Such was the ambition of
i his soul that his body swelled to mar- I
j velous proportion. Indeed, Aesop went
so far as to predict that the frog upon
reaching the size of the elephant.
j would burst. I commend to your notice
the wisdom of Aesop. It took over f
two thousand years for his prophecy
to come true. Only last week the
frog-elephant or the elephant-frog I
exploded. The Republican party
for years succeeded in deceiving the 1
country. Now it is successfully de- I
ceiving itself. In its platform it offers I
pulchritudinous promise but with j
vacuous intent It promises tho coun- i
try in the main what the Democratic
party has already done or is in the
process of doing, saving alwavs, the
bogus god "Protection." It has '
cloaked its iniquity with a judicial f
robe but the cloven hoof of special in-
terest still protrudes. - i
People Wards ot G. O. P. f
"The board of directors has sat in j
Chicago and again resolved that they !
are Ike country. They have adopted :
the doctrine of foreordi nation and pre- 1
destination, but have made it appli- ?
cable only to themselves. , ;
"The rest of the people are their f
wards for profit.
"Ambition is a noble tribute, bat I
when it is adulterated with greed, a 1
cataclysm is inevitable. We have re- ;
cently witnessed the painful spectacle i
of two great American parties at Chi- f
cago putting self in place of ideals; S
self-glorification in place of national '
honor; Republicanism and Progres- ;
siveism so-called, in place of our only ;
ism' Americanism. . f
"We have witnessed the drab spec- j
tacle of two groups of men trading
principles like competitors in a fish '
market, in the hope that some com- t
promise would win public support. ;
They have not come together they '
have fallen out over the 'swag'. For
the sake of victory, many of these
men, essentially opposite in principle,
have been willing to become friends
with false masks. The result Is in
evitable "Divided they fall.' We are
proud in the thought that United we
stand.' We welcome the pent-up
Americanism of the real Progressives
individually to our ranks, offering
them a haven, in principle. Their
leader has abandoned, them with gross
cruelty.
ReonJon for Self.
"The gentleman from Oyster Bay, in
a recent letter to Chlcasro. onntarf
Abraham Lincoln as saying 'May not

unite in a common effort to save ntir
common country.' Ladies and gentle
men, I beg to call your attention to
the word 're-unite." The words 'save
the country" have been the disguise of
the opposition for years. There mar
be a political war today in this coun
try, but that war only exists between
factions. Why did the gentleman
quote the words of Lincoln? In the
hope of re-uniting Americans? No.
Americans are re-united as never be
fore. He meant by re-uniting that tw
factions of his party should re-nnlte.
These two factions or parts of them

' hour when every one should see
whether in his inner consciousness he

the later periods of dramatlo eplsod.

Maintained the Ideal.
"The Democratic party, in the face
of scandalous and vicious attacks, has
maintained thiB great American ideal.
While for peace it has steadily and
surely worked for sound and power
ful preparedness.. It naa maintained
a solemn, calm dignity in ihe face of
eircumtances which mixht have
drawn it into the vortex of a world

seekers, it has maintained friendly re
lations throughout the world;- it has
been true to the spirit of America.

convention, the elephant is dead, tho
moose is dead. Long live the American:"
