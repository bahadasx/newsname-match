Which Do You Prefer?
It is important for reasons of health and
practical economy for every housekeeper
to ask herself this question:
"Do I prefer a pure baking powder like
Royal, made of cream of tartar derived from
grapes, or am I willing to use a baking
powder made of alum or phosphate, both
derived from mineral sources ? "
The names of the ingredients printed
on the label show whether the kind you
are now using or any brand, new or old,
thai may be offered is a genuine cream
of tartar powder, or merely a phosphate
or alum compound.
Royal Baking Powder contains no alum
nor phosphate.
