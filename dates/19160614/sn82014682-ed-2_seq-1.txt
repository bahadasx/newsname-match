Thus was -the sentiment of AuS'
tralia described today by W W. For-
wocd cf Adelaide, .member of "'the
Australian war council and, president
cf the' Associated Chamher' of liana

continued Fcrwood. "With total
population, of but' 5,000,000 she has al
ready Eent S60.000 men to the front
tad is prepared to make it 600,000 if
she ia called uron.' The one Idea that
imbues the Commonwealth is to make
a thorough job of the war. - Men are
leavins their work and traveling hun
dred3 cf miles for an opportunity to
cn.lis t r lly sons volunteertd ' at the
beginnings-One. of them, a lieutenant,
is 'som e where ia France' and the
other is in Egypt . : i.'y.:.-)
"I want to say that now and in the
future there is room, for much expan
sion - of trade between the . United
States and Australia, Doth ways. I air
convinced that the present' generation,
at least in my country, will refuse to
resume commercial relations,, witn
Germany after tne? war.We feel that
the money we have been .paying : to
Germany all these " years has. been
used to "prepare' her, army sind navy
for the killing of our own men. There
fore we ' feel that ' the opportunity is
ripe for the development of trade with
America. - ;
"My mission in the United States
has been to inquire into the making
