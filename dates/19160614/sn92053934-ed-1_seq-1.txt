WILSON AND MARSHALL FOR
NOVEMBER VICTORY SLOGAN
OF DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES
Conventionites Convinced of
Success With the Same

ALL UNITE IN PEACE
Party Evidences Greatest
Harmony in Its History
Baker Favors Moose,
Washington, June 14.
Efforts to insert a plank in
the democratic platform fa
voring a law to prohibit fed
eral judges from leaving the
bench to accept elective of
fice will not be countenanced
by President Wilson. Ad
ministration officials let it be
known that the president
had sent word to St. Louis
that he did not want any
petty politics played.
St. Louis. Jnne It. There will
he about 12..VIO spats in the Coli
seum. There, w ill he 1.V2 seats on
the platform. 172 seals in the sec
tion reserved for newsnaKr and
press associations. 23 for weekly
papers, and 2.152 for delegates and
alternates. The remainder will he
in hoxes and balconies.
Wilson. Marshall and Victory.
Wilson and Marshall and victory in
November, was the program of the
delegates who crowded into the big
Coliseum here today for the opening
session of the democratic national con
vention. There probably was not one
democrat who went into the building
who could recall when a national con
vention of that party entered upon its
work with more harmony than that
which prevailed among the more than
one thousand delegates today. The
candidates for president and vice pres
ident have been decided upon and, ac
cording to ihe leaders, there will be no
friction over the party's declaration of
principles. Only the phraseology of a
. few planks in the platform remains to
be agreed upon.
Enliven Proceedings.
Despite the expected cut. and dried
proceedings which the party managers
hope to enliven by calling upon old
campaigners to deliver ringing
speeches to the delegates at odd mo
ments during the assemblies, the ser-geant-at-arms
of the convention was
prepared with a small army of assist
ants to handle large crowds at all of
the meetings. Every seat in the oval
shaped hall has been allotted and ar
rangements were made to take care of
hundreds in spaces back of the seats
and in the aisles. The interior of the
Coliseum was handsomely decorated,
the national colors predominating.
All Hear Picture of President,
The city itself was dressed for the
occasion and the fact that this was Flag
day, the anniversary of the birth of
the American flag, helped in the dis
play of the colors.
Quite in contrast to the republican
convention at Chicago when more than
a score of different kinds of buttons
were worn, announcing favorite son
candidates for president, there was but
one button seen on the delegates today
and that carried a likeness of Presi
dent Wilson. Delegates shouted for
Wilson, wore neckties with the name
Wilson embroidered on them or car
ried pictures of the president.
Several V. P. Buttons.
Those who did not have on 'Wilson
buttons wore some emblem indicating
their favorite for vice president
Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana, Roger
C Sullivan, of Illinois, Governor Major
of Missouri or Governor Morehead of
Nebraska. Hut only one of those ap
peared to he in the running, the pres
ent vice president. President Wilson
has indicated his preference for his
ninning mate of four years ago and
there is not the slightest doubt that

ARREST MAN FOR
SLAYING FAMILY
Kansas City, June 14 The evidence
against William Mansfield, who was
arrested in Kansas City, Kan., yester
day, as a suspect in connection with
the murder of six members of the
Moore family at Villisca, Iowa, in
1312, is circumstantial, O. T. Gillette,
county attorney of Montgomery coun
ty, Iowa, where the murder was com
mitted, declared today after reaching
Kansas City to question the prisoner.
Mansfield maintained that he could
prove he was working at a packing
plant at Milwaukee at the time of the
crime. He declared he would waive
extradition and return to Iowa, adding
that he believed that would be the
easiest way out of the trouble.
Although arrested yesterday as a
suspect, Mr. Gillette said today a
warrant specifically charging Mans
field with the crime had been issued.

Heart Pains
AwakingSon
New York, June 14. Kermit and
Mrs. Roosevelt, son and daughter-in-law
of Theodore Roosevelt, arrived
here with their baby from Buenos
Aires today on the United States army
transport Kilpatrick. They were met
at the pier by Colonel and Mrs.
Roosevelt, ,
Persons at the dock observed that
the former president walked with, his
left hand at times pressed under his
heart Questioned by his wife, he
told her he had a pain but believed it
would pass away presently. This
proved to be the case by the time the
vessel berthed.
Kermit Roosevelt had been in South
America as representative of a New
York- bank. His wife, daughter of
Joseph E. Willard, ambassador to
Spain, suffered an attack of typhoid
while in the tropics.
Later it was explained that Colonel
Roosevelt was suffering from a very
bad cold contracted several months
ago.
After leaving the pier he kept an ap
pointment with a throat specialist. Ho
has been visiting the physician upon
the occasions of his coming here from
Oyster Bay.
Reports today that Theodore Roose
velt was seriously ill apparently
proved unfounded. He has been ex
periencing coughing spells recently
and in a statement late today regard
ing an attack of pain while he was at
pier this morning awaiting the ar
rival of his son Kermit from South
America, the colonel explained that
this coughing probably had strained
a ligamenL An X-ray examination
will be made, probably tonight.
"One year ago," the colonel said,
"I broke one of my ribs in the left
side while riding. The horse fell and
threw me. The coughing spells which
I have had probably strained a liga
ment. It is ridiculous but painful, so
like King Gog, I arch my neck and
walk lightly."
fhieaen Observes Flair Day.
Chicago, 111., June 14. Flag day, the
109th anniversary of the American
flag, was generally observed through
out the city today by the display of the
emblem and by numerous exercises.
Democratic Convention
(Special to The Argus.)
St. Louis, June 14. St Louis be
lieves in preparedness, reasonable,
sane preparedness and enthusiastic
preparedness too. In the arrangements
for the democratic national convention
which opened today, every possible
detail is complete, both as to accom
modations for the convention and for
those who come here for the doings.
The Coliseum appointments could not
be more perfect.
St. Louis is also prepared to the
limit in entertainment in other ways.
The Business Men's association has
cooperated in providing means of di
version outside of the convention
hours. St. Louis has also taken care
to arrange that the stay of her visi
tors will not be abbreviated. It was a
condition of the contract by which the
convention was located here, that it
should last at least four days. The
hotels had something to do with this,
as all the reservations are made on a
four-day agreement, at rates running
from $8 to $10 per day.
Few men of national conventions
are big enough to need no introduc
tion; as a matter of fact, there is but
one. Temporary and permanent chair
men must be presented with much
eclat and much formality. Gentlemen
of the cloth who ask a divine blessing
upon convention proceedings must be
given formal entree. Even the small
est delegate from the smallest state
must be formally recognized by a pre
siding officer.
.Not so with the gentleman from New
York, who started proceedings in to
day's convention. He is William V.
McCombs, chairman of the democratic
national convention, a lawyer, a grad
uate of Princeton, and a personal
friend of President Wilson, chosen by
him four years ago to manage his cam
paign. He was successful. Over the
country they call him "the man who
made Wilson president" Failing
health brought on during his extra ef
forts of four years ago, may prevent
bim from serving longer, but his
charming personality will not be lost
to the workers who were identified
with him in the last campaign. He is
the kind of a man who will always be
remembered in the most pleasant man
ner. The democratic national convention
has chosen well in its chairmen, tem
porary and permanent. Former Gov
ernor Martin H. Glynn of New York,
who sounded the keynote, became fam
ous through the caprices of William
Sulzer, whom he succeeded when the
latter was deposed as governor of New
York. The selection of Glynn was
grounded not only on his ability to
handle the English language, but be
cause of his political ideals and be
liefs, which parallel very closely to the
principles admired by the president. If
Glynn has forgotten to say anything as
temporary chairman in sounding the
keynote of the convention, anything
that is missing will be put on by that
big silver tongued senator from Ken
tucky, OIlie James, who acted in a
similar cacpacity at the Baltimore
convention. He is a great man in the
world of politics and letters, and is a
close personal friend of Woodrow Wil
son. From the time that the memory of
man runneth not to the contrary. John

Washinirton. Jnne 11. In a Flat?
day speech here today. President
Wilson charged that there were
some foreign born persons in the
United Slates nho were tryinp to
levy a kind of political blackmail
on the American political party in
the interest of foreign govern
ments. This, the president declared,
mnst be stopped. He was sonnd
incr what some of his advisers said
would be one of the issnes of the
coming political campaign.
Washington, D. C, June 14. Led by
President Wilson carrying the stars
and stripes nearly 75,000 men, women
and children of Washington marched
up broad Pennsylvania avenue today
in a preparedness parade arranged in
celebration of Flag day to emphasize
the national capital's demand for an
adequate army and navy.
The president had prepared an ad
dress on "America first," to be deliver
ed on the White house lawn after the
parade.
The president, attired in white trous
ers, blue coat and straw hat, and
shouldering a flag like a musket, step
ped briskly to martial airs played by
the United States marine band. He
smiled broadly and frequently raised
his hat in response to cheers as he
marched between two Washington
citizens, escorted by Secretary Tumul
ty, the While house employes and the
White house newspaper corps.

JAMES
I. Martin, St Louis lawyer, has been
the fellow whose word was absolutely
law so far as the mechanical end of
democratic national conventions are
concerned. Politicians have stormed
the country; democracy's factions have
gnashed their teeth and swore that
this man or that man must be the
nominee for president, favorite sons
have come and favorite sons have
gone, but when it came to choosing a
sergeant-at-arms, there has never been
any discussion. John I. Martin has
always been chosen. When Martin
passes into the great beyond democ
racy will not know how to run its na
tional conventions.
Tickets to the convention are of an
extraordinarily beautiful type. Coun
terfeiting is said to be impossible, but
Charles Boeschenstein of Illinois, in
charge of the pasteboards, is taking no
chances, and hence many are called
but few are chosen in the distribution.

SL Louis, Mo., June 14. Victory for
the suffragists in the democratic na
tional convention today appeared S3
close that "General" Updegraff's well
laid plans to keep silent her 8,000
"marchers" in the walkless, talkless
"Golden Lane" demonstration ap
peared likely to be shattered. The
participants had promised their "gen
eral" faithfully, that during the two
hours of the display they would not
utter a sound, and them in the clos
ing hours of preparation, a tentative
draft of a suffrage platform plank ten
dered them by democratic lead
ers put them in a shouting mood.
The plank contains everything
which the suffragists have been fight
ing for. It would put the party on
record as favoring passage of a con
stitutional amendment to enfranchise
women. The plank as drafted refers
to the large number of voting women
in the 12 enfranchised states, one of
the principal arguments the women
have been using regarding their
strength.
Members of the National American
Woman Suffrage association were ex
pected to put their unqualified appro
val on the plank today and represen
tatives of the woman's party already
have indorsed it. The latter orguii
zation insists that adoption of the
plank should be followed by immediate
action in congress but that, it was
pointed out, is something over which
platform makers have no control. If
the plank is adopted, however, leaders
of the woman's party will turn atten
tion to congress and try to force the
Susan B. Anthony amendment through
both houses before adjournment of the
present session.

Roger C. Sullivan is getting a first

president regardless of what may
come of it and notwithstanding that
the nomination by the republicans of
Charles W. Fairbanks seems to dic
tate wisdom of the renomination by
this convention of Vice President
Thomas R. Marshall, the Illinois lead
er will not fail of highly compliment
ary consideration at the hands of the
convention. Missouri will present to
the convention for second place on the
ticket Governor Elliott W. Major,
while Ohio will come strong for New
ton W. Baker, present secretary of
war, and there will be others. The
seriousness of Baker's candidacy, of
course, depends upon the wibhes of

Paris, June 14, (11:45 a, m.) A
violent artillery engagement took

says.
The French carried a small German

A raid by French troops at Songern

of a number of Germans.
The text of the statement follows:
"Between the river Oise and the

enemy has been driven back with in
fantry fire at a point southeast of
Moulin-Sous-Touvent. East of Sois
sons we have occupied a small Ger

his willingness to meet representatives
of the Congressional 1'nion for Woman
Suffrage. He will see them within a

Everett Colby of New Jersey, a pro

inson called on Mr. Hughes during the
noon hour and had a lengthy confer
ence with him. They declined to dis
cuss the report that they were making
effort to bring Colonel Roosevelt and

When .National Chairman JIo '
Combs called the convention to or
der 12,000 delegates, alternates,
and spectators packed the big coll-
sewn to the roof. Members of the
national committee, members of -President
Wilson's cabinet and
party leaders from all over the
conntry had plas on the plat
form. Plaster medallions of Wash

delegates from the decoration

convention hall but only as favorite
sons compliments.
When National Chairman McComba
had called the convention to order the

call by Secretary J. Bruce Kremer.
Former Governor Glynn of New
York was next with the keynote speech.
Proceedings Plashed to Wilson.
Down under the speaker's stand di
rect telephone and telegraph wires to
the White house carried momentary re

All prospect of a fight in the conven
tion had gone glimmering overnight
with William J. Bryan's announcement
that he did not propose to press cer
tain planks before the resolutions com
mittee and that he would make cam
paign speeches for the democratic
nominee.

"We have entered this hall as demo
crats; let us deliberate as Americans,"
declared Mr. Glynn in sounding the
keynote.
"It is the business of this conven
tion representing every section of the
United States, speaking for every ra
cial strain in America to send forth a
message to all the world that will
leave no room for doubt"
Review'ng President Wilson's con
duct of t,-eign affairs, he declared the
president had stood with Washington,
Adams and Grant, who had preserved .
peace with honor.
Against Iron Policy.
"For vain glory or for selfish pur
poses," ho declared, "others may cry
for a policy of blood and iron, but the
president has acted on the belief that
the leader of a nation who plunges
his people into an unnecessary war,
like Pontius Pilate, vainly washes his
hands of innocent blood while the
earth quakes and the heavens are
darkened and thousands give up the
ghost.
"If Washington was right, if Jeffer
son was right, if Hamilton was right.
then the president is right today," he
declared.
Knilding Fills Rapidly.
The coliseum filled rapidly just be
fore noon. The bands were not al
lowed to march into the hall. There
was little excitement or cheering dur
ing the half hour preceding the open
ing of the convention.
Moving picture machines and cam
eras were planted at every vantage
point.
Because of the heat under a glaring
skylight, many of the delegates re
moved their coats.
Throw Bales 0' Cotton.
The Texas delegation tossed minia
ture souvenir bales of cotton to the
galleries.
At 11:45 the official band began the
opening selection In accompaniment to
a male quartet that sang a new song
about America through megaphones.
The song brought the first applause of
the day.
Just before the convention waa
called to order, the band struck up
"Columbia the Gem of the Ocean" and
the delegates rose Joining In the chorus
