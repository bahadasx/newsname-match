Lots of trade goes from Wil

have some come from Estancia
to Willard?
Peter McKissor and Linas and
Ivor are doing some tall hustling
to keep up with the weeds on
their 125 acres of crop. They
are doing it too.
If every man did as much for
Willard as George Alter what a
different place it would be. Nice
fireproof building, nice cement
walk on grade; nice clean shop.
What's the matter with Wil-
Lard in the baby line? We are
very, very short of our true share
there. Can it be that the ex
orbitant doctors' charges have a
depressing effect that way? It
looks like it.

The Feast of tho Sacred Heart was celebrat
ed at the Catholic church here last week.
Knther Dekeuwer was assisted by Father Jose
Quintero of the Cathedral of Zacatecas, Mexi
co. A beautiful statue of the Sacred Heart, do
nated by Joe lirazil and his Bister Mrs. Mary
Leonardo, was dedicated. It's a fine and ap
propriate ornament to the already pretty in
terior of the beautiful little church. That's a
boy, Joe. Now one more ceremony and you are
fixed right.
OLDER BUT STRONGER
To be healthy at seventy, prepare at
forty, is sound advice, because in the
strength of middle life we too often forget
that neglected colds, or careless treat
ment of slight aches and pains, simply
undermine strength and bring chronic
weakness for later years.
To be stronger when older, keep your
blood pure and rich and active with the
strength-building and blood-nourishing
properties of Scott's Emulsion which is a
food, a tonic and a medicine to keep your
blood rich, alleviate rheumatism and
avoid sickness. No alcohol in Scott's.
