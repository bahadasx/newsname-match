his pension certificate In the Safe of

Waugh naturally considered It the
safest place to keep the treasured
pension document, all of which was
doubtless true until safecrackers
landed in Edray on the night of August
4 and finding only one safe in the
place to crack, why, they just up and
cracked It. Ampng other contents
of the strong box which disappeared
was the pension certificate. The details
of this crook drama are given
with graphic delineation In a letter
from Mr. Waugh to Congressman
Sutherland. The latter Immediately
started the ball of governmental red
tape to unwinding and In course of
time the Edray pensioner will have a
new pension certificate to take the
place of the one the yeggs yanked
from Its hiding place.
