THE RURAL TEACHERAGE
The current Ladies' Home Journal
contains a page of photographs and de
scriptions that should interest every
resident of our rural districts, who is
anxious to see IiIb children have as
good school facilities as can be had in
the cities. This page contains a num
ber of photographs Of teacheroges sit
uated in various states of the union.
What is n teacherage? Well, aoout
the best explanation is that it bears
tne fame relation to the school that
the parsonage does to the church. Al
most every one Is familiar with the
fact that the churches have long been
accustomed to owning a ridence for
the use of their pastor during the term
of ills pastorate. The deed to the
property it vested in the church.
The teacherage is owned by tlte
school district and is the residence ot
the teaiher while he or she is employed
by that district. The rent of the same
is included as u part of the teacher's
salary, just as in the cae of the pas
tor. This plan should appeal to the school
districts of this section of Oklahoma
for the reason that the usual country
school employs only one teacher, and
tt is conceded that the married man
makes the most satisfactory teacher in
every way in the rural districts. Then
too, there are very few houses in the
country except such as are already oc
cupied by the farmers themselves. In
muny instaiicei il is necessary for the
teachers to live many miles from their
(school, so far that a conveyance is
needed to reach it. This plan has
many drawbacks, especially in winter.
Under the new plan, when it is car
ried to full completion, the school is
situated on a plot containing several
i.eies, suy from ' to 10. The school
building proner occupies the most cou
veu ent location. A suitable building
is placed on the plot for n teacherage.
The remaining laud is divided between
plnygrounds fur the. children and u
s unit farm for the teacher.
Uncle Sam, himself, hti become in
terested in the idea and has had plans
drawn by expert architects und land
scape gardeners suitable for district
d siring to put it into practice. When
Uncle Sam takes up with an idea you
may be sure that it has decided merits.
T.ie truth of thu matter is that anyone,
who has lived in the country, witi see
the many benefits to be derived from
this plan, but probably the one that
will Impress them most is the fact that
with a teacherage on its school lot and
the rent of same Included In addition
to the regular salary, the best teachers
in the country would fall over them
selves in the rush to obtain employ
ment from tho fortunate district.
We commend this idea to every
rural school district in the county.
Those who read this should call the
attention of their neighbors to it and
more especially -the directors or the
district. There are several plans by
which a teacherage can be built. The
district can appropriate funds fur that
purpose, the people of the district can
contribute to a fund or, and perhaps
this is the best means, the teachers,
themselves, can take the matter up
and push it to completion. Entertain
me its can be given and the receipts
applied to the building fund. Any
teacher, who takes the matter up with
enthusiasm, can soon arouse their dis
trict to the advantages uf the plan and
accomplish their object within the
space of one term. They may not be
elected for another term so that they
will enjoy the fruits of their labor, but
this should not deter them from push-
log the project with all their might
and main. Let all the teachers get
sutUcicntly interested and it will not
be long until every school will have its
teuuherage, just as almost every
church lias its parsonage. Let them
lollow the disinterested example of
the pastors of the churches and they
the teachers 88 a class will reap the
benefits,
ODD FELLOWS' PICNIC
LARGELY ATTENDED
As was announced in the Herald of
last week, tho Odd Fellows held their

Interesting and instructive.
The comfort of the largo crowd was
well looken nf.er. there being plenty of

Special committees hid been appointed
to care for the various details and nil
agree that none of them were derelict
in their duty. The day wus especially
enjoyed by the children, swings and
other amuiement devices being pre
pared fur their especial benefit.
It is reported on pood authority thnt
the dinner far surpassed any ptevious
effort of its kind ever put forth in Bra
ver. T!nre was such n quantity of it
fiat the crowd, lnrp.e as it woe, could
scarcely make an impression upon it,
ro it was decided to stay and make a
a second assault nt sundown,
The Odd Fellows, themselves, with
their families and friendcr, all report
the day as being well spent arid high j
enjoyed.
