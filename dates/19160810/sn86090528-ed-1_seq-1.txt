MEDIATION
ACCEPTED
One step toward averting the threat
ened strike of railway trainmen was
taken when the parties to the contro
versy consented to accept the services
of the federal board of mediation and
conciliation. How important this step
is remains to be seen. Mediation is
not to be confused with arbitration.
Mediation may lead to the latter but
thus far this Js no indication that the
trainmen are willing to submit their
case to any board or tribunal empow
ered to make an award. The best that
mediators can do is to get the parties
to the dispute together on a basis
which may result in an understanding
being reached. It is a hopeful sign,
however, when the mediation board Is
allowed to use its good offices.

ed on. A few moments later he was
stabbed in the right side with a long
knife, two and one-half inches below
tho liver. The injury is serious.
He was brought to Chickasha and
placed in tho hospital at noon today,
being accompanied by Mrs. Boulware
and Dr. W. W. Kerley.

C. Pratt, a prominent citizen and own
er of tho Pratt grocery at that place,

o'clock last evening preparatory to re
tiring, a man whose identity is as yet
unknown but who is presumed to have
been bent on robbery,- pushed in the
closing door and called to Pratt to
hold up his hands, following his com
mand with two shots In rapid succes
sion, both of which, owing to close
proximity to the victim, took effect.
Bullets Take Effect.
One bullet entered the side of the
head and lodged there, while the sec
ond lodged in the abdomen. Although
grievously wounded Pratt stepped back
of his counter and seizing his gun
fired at his assailant but with what re
sult is not known. The fellow escap

The firing immediately brought a
crowd of officers and citizens and a
posse, with two bloodhounds, started
on the trail which was lost two blocks
north of the store.

With scores of conferences, till lead
ing up to a decision on their choice
for president, leaders from the twelve
suffrage states composing tho party
met here today to decide which way to
throw tho 4,000,000 votes they claim
to control.
Four speakers will train their guns

The conferees here have just one
motive; to force passage of the consti

to vote. If the Democrats don't show
signs of passing; It qujckly, they de
clared today, those 4,000,000 votes are
going to be Republican, or Prohibition,
or Progressives, or Socialists or what
ever they will do the most good or
harm.
To back up their threat to rock the
boat in the coming election, the wom

say, ought to frighten even tho most

that they control enough votes In each
