Lloyd McCarl of Franklin township,
on the charge of stealing a mare and

week. As nearly as could be learn
ed by an interview with U. R. Ram

that led up to the arrest of the Mc
Carl boys are as follows:
It was Tuesday noon when Mr
Ramsey, his brother and his father,

farm missed a brown mare weighing
about 1200 pounds and her colt. As
the pasture gate was open they sup

Wednesday evening both of the ac

Carl is a young man about 21 years of
age and his brother Lloyd is yet in

mitted that he took the mare, and

U. R. Ramsey's son was a party to
the offense. Mr. Ramsey advises the
reporter that he having never, been
