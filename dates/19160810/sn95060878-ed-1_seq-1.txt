To cross the continent on
horseback is a feat seldom re
corded, yet a frail woman,
Miss H. H. Thinglestad, of
Seattle, has undertaken such
a strenuous task and she is
now in Yuma on her way to
New York.
She is taking x plenty or
time for the trip, leaving Se
attle one year ago. She ar
rived in os Angeles at Christ
mas tide and has spent the
past few months touring in
Southern California, on her
trusty steed, collecting data
for an account of her trip
; after it has been completed.
! Although strongly advised by her
i friends not to make the desert trip
in mid summer, nothing daunted, she
ventured the trip from San Diego to
Tuma, arriving here Tuesday, and
i she is now ready to leave for the
East.
j To the Examiner she confided that
!she had found the heat trying and
'the loss of sleep more so. It being
, too hot to travel by day, even when
crossing the mountains between San
Diego and the Imperial country. She

Future generations of Eu
ropean countries now at war
with each other not only will
have to pay the costs of that
war in material wealth, but
also in the lowered standards
of their physical, mental and
moral efficiency, according
to Dr. David Starr Jordan,
Chancellor Emeritus, Leland
Stanford, Jr., University,
who today addressed the
members of the Pacific Divi
sion of the American Asso
ciation for th? Advancement
of Science, on "War and "Eu
genics." He concludes "that war
weakens the breed by depriv
ing it of its finest strain is
'now an unquestioned fact in
biology as in history."
He said in part:
"Every army insists, in its enlist
ments, on obtaining men above the
average in physical efficiency. Its
ideal is the red-blooded man with, dash
and daring, a bit of an adventurer to
begin with, to "be reduced to a cog
in a great machine by the pressure
of military discipline. In general,
those who fight "best are most likely j
to be killed. i

Secretary of the Interior
Franklin K. Lane is to be
chairman of the commission
to attempt a settlement of
the differences between the
United States and Mexico.
Such, at least, is the an
nouncement made from
Washington, which also says
that Associate Justice Bran
deis will be a member of the
commission, the third mem
ber not having been an
nounced, though the place
has probably been offered to
ex-President Taft.
In the selection of Secre
tary Lane, the President has
pinned his faith on "the right
man for the right place," for,
of all men in the United
States, Secretary Lane is
probably the one man who!
will be acceptable to every
body in America.
He is not only a man of unusual
attainments, but a, broad-minded,
liberal thinking statesman of the
very highest type, and, having been a
member of the Cabinet all during the
recent troubles with Mexico, he is
familiar with every phase of the vari
ous questions that Avill come before
the Commission for final adjudication.
It is not known at this time just
what questions are to be settled, be
yond the withdrawal of our troops
from Mexico, indemnity for American
losses, and agreement as to future
movement of troops to keep the
peace along the frontier.
It is hoped, however, that the scope
of the commission will take in ever
question that has been a thorn in the
side of both countries ever since the
Gadsden purchase. This question
will naturally lead to a settlement of
the water rights of the Colorado river,
and on this particular question Sec-
The suction dredger, El
Centro, operating just above
the rock and pile dam at
Hanlon heading, broke loose
from its moorings at 5 o'clock
last evening and went crash
ing against the trestle, tear
ing out five bents of piles
(80 feet) and wedged itself
firmly between adjacent
piles, where it is now, stuck
hard and fast.
The accident was caused
by the slipping of the i:n-
holding
the
mense cable
dredger.
In a telephone communication with.
Hanlon heading this morning it was
stated that the dredger was not dam
aged and that it would be pulled out
of the trestle within a short time
work in that direction having already
begun.
When asked as to what effect the
break in the dam would have on the
flow of water through the Hanlon
head-gates, it was stated that at this
time it was impossible to tell, but
that it was hoped all the damage

"'The bravest men,' says Darwin,
who were always willing to come to
the front in war, and who
risked their lives for others, would
on an average perish in greater
numbers than other men. Better
men would make better history. The
demands of battle and camp cut off
men from parenthood in the prime of
life. This leaves the vmen war can
not use to be the fathers of coming'
generations.
"By the laws of heredity, like the
seed is the harvest and the future
of the races rests with those who are
its actual ancestors. 'Lions breed
lions,' says the Spanish proverb, 'a
brave man has brave sons.' Of like
import is the Moorish proverb. "The
father a weed; the mother a weed!
-Do you expect the daughter to be
saffron root?'
"A nation does not miss that which
it has not had. If it did, it would
realize that the longest cost of war is
that of impoverishment of the breed.
'War's greatest cost,' says Paul Dan-
The Twenty-first
infantry band
freely concert last night was unusually
largely attended, the announcement
having been previously made that
the ladies v of the Baptist church
would serve e cream and cake dur
ing the evening, the proceeds to go
to the church. Reclamation park was
filled with men, women and children,
and if they didn't enjoy the evenin
it was because they did not like a fine
musical program, or enjoy ice cream.
Now that the Baptists have set the
example, it is presumed that in due
time all other churches will take ad
vantage of Mr. Lawson's good nature
and give the people occasional
chances to eat ice cream and cake
while the band plays "in the good,
old summer time."

W. H. Heyser, of Bard, who for
several months has been connected
with the Overland company, is now
connected with Winn & Huss in hand
ling the seductive little jitney.
The County Fair directors will
meet this afternoon in regular ses
sion, one of the main questions for
consideration being the method to be
pursued to force Glenn Wheeler, the
former fair commissioner, to give up
the exhibit fruit jars which he now
claims as his personal property. It
is unnecessary to say that Mr. Gleen
Wheeler's friends are surprised at his
actions, for every subscriber to the
fund, which went to purchase the
exhibit jars, was told the jars were
to serve Yuma county for all time to
come. However, the fair directors
will see what can be done to gain,
possession of these much needed jars.
The Colorado, after reaching a
gauge of over twenty feet, is falling
quite rapidly. In the meantime work
is progressing as rapidly as possible
on the Hanlon heading dam, the flow
down the canal now being something
like three thousand second-feet.
