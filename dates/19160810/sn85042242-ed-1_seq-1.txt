If Mediation Fails to Prevent the
Strikes, Chief Executive Will
Be Appealed To.
NO REPORT ON
CONFERENCE RESULTS
Understood That Railroad Rep­
resentatives Outlined Posi­
tion in Full.
New York, Aug. 8.—If M'.e United
States board of mediation «nd .o'leili
ation, which was called In to-lay to
adjust the differences between the
railroads of the country and their
460,000 employes, fails, Preiideni. Wil­
son will be asked to use his personal
influence to avert a gener.il stri.'-e.
This statement was made today ly
the' representatives of die .ail-oad
managers, who have been negotiating
with the men since June 1 for a
peaceful settlement.
The appeal to the president, would
be the last resort and would be lal?on
only to save the nation fro tha par­
alysis that would follow a strike of
the magniture planned by the ail
road men.
Mediation Efforts Under Way.
Late tonight efforts of the federal
mediators to bring the contending fac­
tions together were well under way.
Six hours after the railroad managers
had served notice on the men that
they would not withdraw their former
rejection of the workers' demands
and had proposed federal mediation,
the mediators and the managers were
closeted in secret session. Media­
tion was suggested in lieu of arbitra­
tion under thfe Newlands act or by
the interstate commerce commission,
proposals
the, Brotherhood.
What was discussed at t,he confer­
ence could hot be divulged by any of
those attending, but it was under­
stood that the railroad representa­
tives outlined their position in full.
It was reported that the railroads
stood steadfastly for the main feature
of their "contingent proposition,"
made, at the June conference which
conceded" the shorter day but elim­
inated double compensation for differ­
ent-classes of services during the
same work day.
FOUMDEiR
OF
GREAT
WESTERN DIES
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 9.—A. E. Stick
ney, founder of the Chicago Great
Western railroad, died at his home
here this morning, after an illness of
one week. He had been in declining
health for several years. Intestinal
trouble with complications was the
cause of death. He was 76 years old.
Members of the Stickney family
and a number of friends were at the
bedside when the end came. Although
best known as the organizer and for
many years the directing force of
the Chicago Great Western, Stickney
was also the builder of several other
roads, and found time to participate
in a large number of activities and to
promote the commercial, social and
educational welfare of the northwest.
Wheat Affected by Black Rust
Will Be Destroyed by
Fire.
'Devils Lake, N. D., Aug. 9.—Chair­
man T. H. Maloney of the board of
county commisisoners, who operates
one of the larger farms in the county,
will hum three hundred acres of
wheat which has been ruined from
the ravages of black rust. There are
many other fields which will be a
total loss. But the practical loss of
his wheat crop is not causing Tom
Maloney any worry. !He just accepts
the situation as .one of the incidents
of life which goes to make things in­
teresting, and will soon have his land
plowed up and ready for a bigger crop
next year.

MOST TRADE WOULD

By Kenneth W. Payne.
New York, Aug. 9.—The country­
wide strike of our railroads, which
menaces the entire United States,
threatens the tie-up of billions of cap­
ital, idleness for the workers of the
country, starvation apd death through
out the land, and.the upheaval of our
social institutions.
Such are the possibilities brought
out by Prof. Emery R. Johnson of the
Unieversity of Pennsylvania, whose
books on railroad transportation for
student and public, and whose investi­
gations of railroad problems for the
United 'States government have won
for him the position of one of the
country's greatest authorities on
American railroads. In view of the
recognition accorded his work indeed,
Prof. Johnson has served on various
commissions, among them the -Isth­
mian canal commission as an expert
on transportation and in a number of
cases between railroads and employes
he has acted as an arbitrator.
'If the railroads of the entire coun­
try become tied up by a general
strike," declared Prof. Johnson today,
"we will draw dangerously close to a
revolution. The goverment naturally
would be obliged to put forth every
effort possible to move trains, the
very life of the people depending on
what the government could accomp­
lish. All the military sterngth the
government possesses would be called
to its assistance, and this would natur­
ally be bitterly resented by the rail­
road strikers and those' in sympathy
with them. From time to time it has
been suggested that in case of a ser­
ious strike the government woluld be

Dr. Gilmore says:
"The subject of dyestuffs has agi­

dealers throughout this country since
the outbreak of the German war has
hindered importation from Europe.
But before Europe ever had heard of
the Western Hemisphere, America
had dyestuffs and dyers.
But the subject of native dyestuffs
held little concern for the incomers
of the European race, just as the
matter of other products of native
American use were little regarded by

Just 13 1-2 Cents Under Topmost
Level at Outbreak of
War.
INTENSE EXCITEMENT
IN TRADING PIT
Estimates Domestic Yield Will
Be Cut Down 136,000,000
Bushels.
Chicago, Aug. 9.—Giant crop losses
in the United States and Canada sent
the wheat market today nearly
straight skyward. At one time the
ascent of prices amounted to 11 3-4
cents a bushel. Trading closed in a
whirl of excitement, showing net
gains of 10 5-8 to 11 5-8 cents, with
the September option at $1.44 1-4 to
$1.44 1-2 and with December at $1.48
to $1.48 3-8.
Something of the strain involved
and of the far-reaching consequences
may be realized by the fact that, ac­
cording to the United States govern­
ment crop report, which was the prin­
cipal cause of today's excitement, the
domestic yield of wheat for 1916 will
be 358,000,000 bushels smaller than
last year.
Black rust spreading in Canada ar.d
indicating that the crop there would
be cut down 136,000,000 bushels for
the 1916 total, made the situation ftih
more acute, as the United States and
Canada have been furnishing :?ix-s«v
enths of the world's breadstuff sup­
plies to tlie countries at war. 'jhe
biggest jump in prices today was
right at the outset, exactly 8 cents a
bushel over night. Strenuous sfforts
to buy cleared the market :t inter­
vals almost completely, aeadmg the
market higher and: higher, until the
May delivery cut $1.53 1-2, a price
just 13 1-2 cents under the topmost
level on record in the violent fluctua­
tions of the first year of the European
war.
ALLIES STILL
Italians Capture Gorizia, 22 Miles
Northwest of City of
Trieste.
TAKE MORE THAN
10,000 PRISONEReS
The victorious offensive of the En­
tente allies on the Galician and Italian
fronts still is being rewarded with im­
portant success. In Austria the Ital­
ians have captured the city of Gorizia,
22 miles northwest of Trieste in Gali­
cia the Russians, in quest of Lemberg,
have progressed, while in France the
French and British forces in the Som
me reion have won additional points
of vantage.
The capture of Gorizia by the Ital­
ians seemingly is as important a gain
by the Entente allies as has yet been
obtained in their present offensive.
The city being the door through which
the Italians may now pass in an en­
deavor ot carry out their long cherish­
ed idea of capturing Trieste, Austria's
big sea port at the head of the Ad­
riatic sea.
Casualties Heavy.
The Italians inflicted heavy casual­
ties on the defenders of Gorizia, took
more than 10,00 men prisoners and
captured considerable war material.
The Russian general, Lechitzky,
has driven his wedge further into the
Austro-German lines, near Scanisla,
capturing eight miles east of that Im­
portant city, through which the rail­
road leads to Lemberg, the town of
Tymrenitsa. '.Northeast of that town
the Russians have crossed the right
bank of the Koropice river and captur­
ed a number of important position
west of Valesniop and southward
along the Niznorff-Monasterzyka rail­
road, making the Russian menace
against Halice greater.

SPEAKS AT FORKS
AND FARGO TODAY
Indications Are That a Large
Crowd Will Greet Him in
Capital City.
Chrales Evans Hughes, Republican
presidential candidate, will invade
North Dakota today, to present the is­
sues of the presidential campaign. 'He
will find that the Republican party is
united behind his candidacy.
His visit to the state formally
launches the national campaign in
this state. It will be several weeks
yet before the state central commit­
tee meets and prepares for the state
campaign. All signs indicate, how­
ever, that the Republican leaders will
swing into line and work for a
straight Republican victory in the
state from one end of the ticket to the
other.
Mr. Hughes arrives this morningjn
Grand Forks, where he makes his
first speech in the state. -An informal
reception has been planned. Mr.
Hughes will deliver his address in one
of the parks, leaving soon after for
Fargo where an evening speech will
be made from a stand erected upon
the campus of the Agricultural col­
lege.
During the afternoon it is likely a
conference of state political leaders
will be held with Mr. Hughes and Gun
der Olson, national committeeman.
Fargo and Grand Forks are in read­
iness for the visit of the presidential
nominee. In Fargo it is planned to
have an automobile parade along
Broadway to Eighth street and thence
to the Gardner hotel, where an infor­
mal reception will be held.
Early Friday morning, Mr. Hughes
will continue his trip westward, stop
ping for addresses at Valley City,
Jamestown, Bismarck, Mandan and
Dickinson.
The local committee has made pre­
parations for the reception of Hughes
in Bismarck. Several automobiles
will motor to McKenzie to meet No.
3 there and escort the party to Bis­
marck. Work will start today upon
the stand to be erected on the west
side of the Exposition building. The
band will be on hand and present Indi­
cations are that a large number from
adjoining towns will cojne to Bis­
marck to hear Mr. Hughes' address.
TELEPHONE IMPROVEMENT.
Center, N. D„ Aug. —An improve­
ment to Oliver county's telephone ser­
vice on the long distance line is be­
ing made between Bismarck and Fort
Clark, including Center and interme­
diate points.
A separate wire is beeing strung
and hereafter people up this way may
have direct connection with points
east without using the same line
used by points up the N. P. branch.
Must Guarantee Storm
or Picnickers of First
Baptist Will Strike
Unless some way is found to guar­
antee a real live thunder storm, with
te brilliant electrical display and all
oter accessories, members of te Bar
aca club and the Young People's Chris­
tian Endeavor society of the First
Baptist church scheduled for a picnic
on the Missouri river, have threaten­
ed to strike.
Last Thursday the societies picnick­
ed on the river bank and were fortu­
nate enough to get caught in the sud­
den storm. Finding refuge in a va­
cant house, they were mistaken for
I. W. W.'s and a lively mix was only
averted by the tact and diplomacy of
the young men. The thrills enjoyed
on that hike have made them look
with disdain on ordinary picnics.
Therefore, President Paul Wessel
of the Baraca club, Rev. Bruce E
Jackson, pastor of the church, and
Miss Carrie Haugen of the Christian
Endeavor society, have before them
this difficult problem of serving up a
cyclone. They will hold a conference
today with Weather Observer Roberts
and see what can be done*

Much of the nominee's address was
devoted to the Mexican situation and
the calling of the national guard to
service on the border. "There have
-been warsingB. for two yean that
America should be tiMpand."
Hughes said, "yet when tM Una
came to put an army on the bordir to
do police service, there was present­
ed a spectacle showing inefficiency of
the first magnitude!"

Criticizes Embargo.
The administration's embargo
arms to Mexico was criticised as "fast
and loose-no policy."
"I don't think it a rash statement,1*
the nominee said. "I think it i« war­
ranted by the facts to say thit any
American soldiel1 killed in Mexico Is
killed by American bullets''that we
have let go over the 'border.
Mr. Hughes referred to a recent ad­
dress to the senate by Senator Lewis
of Illinois.
"He didn't like some statements of
mine," the nominee said. "They di­
stressed him. I am glad of It. That
was the intention. But there asn't
a word in what I said that he or any­
body else could answer.
"The punitive expedition to Mexi­
co," Mr. Hughes said, 'was only called
punitive.
"The only punishment inflicted was
punishment inflicted on ourselves,"
he said. "We punished nobody else."
A large portion of the nominee's ad-'
dress was devoted to' reiteration of
his views on the need for Industrial
co-operation and preparation for com­
mercial competition by Europe after
the war.
Leave for North Dakota.
