After hiring a band to play the
Star Spangled Banner, the Mu
nition Maker informed tbe Par
ents that tbey should consider it
tbeir greatest joy to be able to
give a son for the honor and
glory of the Republic.
The Parents, saddened, yet
with patriotism in tbeir ' hea ts,
gave tbeir son, that he might
march against Mexico. ,
In Washington there was a
man called the President. He
brought order from chaos and
made Mexico understand things
without tbe necessity of a bloody
wor. ,.
Tbe Munition maker was irate
and said to the Parents, "He re
fuses to send your boy to the
slaughter. We might bave had
a glorious war and now this man
called the President ends tbe
trouble without having your boy
made a target. Surely you will
not vote for such a man." Salina

Daylight Robbery
Sometime Wednesday morning
someone entered the M & M
Drug store, presumably via the
back door, and "lifted" a canvas
sack from tbe safe containing
$78 00 in silver, checks, and cur
rency. Of course tbe tbief will
no doubt make use of the silver
and the currency, but to him the
checks are of no value, while to
the M& M tbey represent a good
percent of the loss. If be will
ma.il thm back to thei-rigtl
cTwner, be will be making rea
titution for his crime in that far
and Pat surely will consider bim
a scholar, a gentlemen, an a man
of the first water.

Miss Etna Dalgarn bad quite a
serious accident tbe first of this
week. When cleaning out the
cellar she found an old basket,
left there by tbe former occu
pant of the bouse, in which were
some old paint brushes, empty
paint tubes, various othr odds
and ends, and a small package,
the contents of which were not
investigated, but being with tbe
paints, was naturally supposed
to contain something used in
that connection. Being of no
value, Miss Etna emptied the en
tire contents of the basket into
tbe stove. Tbe mysterious pack
age evidently contained gun
powder, and if not, something
else equally as explosive, for. a
terrific explosion followed al
most immediately. Her fate 8ud
Car Shortage Felt
A number of those bringing
wheat to Meade have difficulty in
unloading for tbe reason that
there is a shortage of cars, the
elevators have their storage bins
filled and the grain dealers hesi
tate to bave the grain unloaded
on the ground. Saturday was
the first dav that our farmers
wire seriously inconvenienced
in this way, even though the ef
fect of the shortage of ca)-?has
been felt by the dealers for some
time. The inability of the rail
roads to provide sufficient cars
to move the wheat seems to be
general, however, tbey teem to
be doing tbeir utmost to relieve
the situation.
Wheat was $1.18 per bushel
Tuesday, and to-day is up to tbe
$1.30 mark.

Will You Help Us?
An open latter tP tbe farmers of
Meade county.
Friends; .
The returns of the deputy
assessors of our Countv artve"
Meade County a population ai-'
little less than 7,000 people.
There is room for more than six-'
times that many. I am traveling:
over Kansas every week and
think that I know of our possi
bilities as compared with otber
parts of our great state. 1 find
no other county in Kansas with
such splendid, rich, soil; produc
ing sucb wonderful crops; where
tbe opportunities and facilities
for stock raising are so perfect;
with so much good water both on
top and under tbe soil of our
cultivated and uncultivated land
as bas our own favored county.
I want to call your attention to
tbe fact that all Meade county
needs to bring it to the front is a
wise, truthful, exposition to the
world of its possibilities and I'
can conceive of no better way to
accomplish this than by tbe pull
ing together of every citizen i"
the county, Let everv ' , '

Remember that the Fair As
sociation is putting forth its best
efforts to advertise the possibil
ities of our county. We are pay
ing tbe very best premiums we
p0sibly can w'tb tbe patronage

our fair a greater one, not alone
to advertise our advantages, but

of your landed estates. Won't

sistance. It redounds to our
mutual benefit.
