HURSERY EXPOSED
TO DIPHTHERIA
I ! Rose Toth Found to be Suffer
ing With Contagious
Disease Thursday.
Twentv-one little children at the
Circle of Mercy day nursery were!
exposed to diphtheria Wednesday by
the presence in the house of Kose I
Toth, w ho was examined by Dr. J. .
B. Berteling this mornimj and said
to have diphtheria.
Mrs. Michael Toth. 1 5 2 S Kendall
aw, mother of two children, Bose
and Paul, for some time past has left
them at the nursery while she was
at work.
Last night when Mrs. Toth went
to visit the children. Mrs. A. Heim
holt, who is in charge at the insti
tution, said that Bose was ill and
that she should he taken to a physi
cian. Then the mother took the
child to the "Kuropan Medical In
stitute," .101 S. Chapin st., where
she was examined by Dr. B. F. Deer,
head physician. Mrs. Toth then re
turned to the nursery with the little
girl, said that the doctor had told
her that there was no danger and
returned home.
Harly this morning Mrs. Heimholt
noticed that Hose was very ill and
called Dr. J. B. Berteling. Dr. Ber
teling pronounced the child a victim
of diphtheria and ordered her taken
away at once.
Door Ma kos Statoinont.
Regarding the case, Dr. Deer said
this afternoon:
"Last night at about 6 'clock the
mother brought her little girl and
hoy to my oflice. The toy had been
here some time ago for a treatment
for stomach trouble. Mrs. Toth said
that the girl was sick and after ex
amining her, I was of the opinion
that she might bo suffering from
tonsilitis. Her tonsils were enlarged
and red. I swabbed out her throat
and told the mother to bring her
back in the morning. .
"There were no symptoms of diph
theria when I examined the child
last niuht. There was absolutely no
false or psuedo membrane in her
throat. Diphtheria is a gradual
sickness, and the mother said that
the child had been suddenly taken
ill. My diagnosis of the case was that
it was tonsilitis. I would not even
now say that it was diphtheria unless
a laboratory examination had been
made.
"The woman did not bring the
child to my otlice this morning."
Cie Anti-Toxin Treatment.
Drs. J. B. Berteling, Charles Bo.
senbury. secretary of the board of
health, and J. Gooken visited the
nursery this afternoon and admin
istered the anti-toxin treatment to
all of the children.
The Circle of Mercy nursery was
established some time aso for the
purpose of caring for children whose
mothers were at work and could not
watch their children in the day time.

Federal Board of Mediation

International News Service:
NEW YORK. Aug. 10. The fed
eral board of mediation and concil
iation held a 53 minutes' meeting
with the delegates of the railroad
employes today at which the prelim
inary steps were taken to avert a
strike on 225 American railways.
After the meeting no formal state
ment was issued but it was reported
that a definite decision in some direc
tion might be made within 24 hours.
G. W. W. Hangar, the third mem
ber of the federal board, was asked
if an appeal would be made to Pres't
Wilson, but he replied that events
hid not proceed to the sta?e where
such action was necessary.
The board afterwards made pre
parations to hold a second confer
ence with the railroad presidents in
the afternoon.
Make No Coiioos-Ions.
Just before the meeting of the
mediators and the railroad presi
dents, Mr. Oarretson was asked if
the men had made any concessions
at their meeting with the federal
board this morning.
"We ar? not diverting from our
original position," answered the ex
ecutive of the Order of Railway
Conductors. "The situation stands
now just as it did before."
The meeting was the first direct
contact between the employes and
the federal organization which is at
tempting to prevent a strike of 400.
000 employes of American railroads.
There were about 600 delegates
from the four organizations of the
"big' four" present. The' chief
spokesmen for the men were: W. S.
Stone, executive of the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Fngineers; W. O. Lee.
head of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trninmen; A. . flarretson. president
of the Order of Railway Conductors,
and W. S. Carter, of the Order of
Enginemen and Firemen.
(1. W. W. Hangar, the third mem
ber of the mediation hoad was asked
today as to what steps had been
taken at the meeting with the rail
road presidents last night, but he
refused to commit himself.
Wilson Koops in Tom h.
Pres't Wilson is understood to be
keeping in close touch with the de
velopments in the railroad situation.
Although no statement was given
out it is reported that the managers,
who represent railroad companies
operating 230,009 miles of trackage,
laid statistics before the federal
mediators showing that the demands
of the men could not be granted
without disturbing the economics of
the nation.
Flisha Iee. chairman of the rail
road managers, is skeptical as to
the possibilities of arbitration, but is
hopeful that the troubles can he set
tled without resorting to any action
which micht prove harmful to the
business of the country.
The federal board is hearing the
arguments of both sides and it is
expected that after these 'iTe fully
digested, proposals will be made
with an object of satisfyin- both the
employers and employes. '
The possibility exists that Pres't
Wilson may be appealed to but de
velopments have n-T yet reached a
principal of which such action is
necessary.
Before meeting the mediators the
leaders of the men held a meeting
in Webster hall at which the situa
tion was carefully canvassed and a
line of action in the joint meeting
with the federal board was decided

r-JSISTS 1LH
SECRETS BE TOLD
Counsel Folk Files Brief De
manding Smith Tell
Where Money Gees.
WASHINGTON, Aug. '1C -Inist-ing
that it is illegal for a railroad
to have any secrets from the people,
Chief Counsel Joseph W. Folk, on
behalf of the interstate commerce
commission, today tiled in the su
preme court of the District of Co
lumbia a brief in support of the
commission's petition asking that
Milton H. Smith, president of the
Louisville and Nashville railway, be
compelled to answer questions put to
him by the commission. These in
terrogations pertain to alleged po
litical campaign contributions, the
hiring of legislative lobbyists and the
using of railroad funds to create
public sentiment in favor of the
i ailroad.
The suit is a sequel to the investi
gation of the Louisville and Nash
ville instigated following a resolu
tion offered by Sen. Luke Lea of
Tennessee, and adopted by the
senate, directing an inquiry of the
company's financial affairs. Sen. Lea
personally filed with the commission
a complaint alleging that the rail
road was using passes and bribes to
corrupt politicians in legislatures of
the states through which the rail
road operates.
Smith Uofuos to Answer.
Fres't mith of the Louisville and
Nashville, who has been chief ex
ecutive of the road since 18S4, was
a picturesque witness at tho investi
gation. He declined to give the com
mission details of the road's tinancU!
operations, declaring that a railroad
had two s'uli-a a public and a prl
ate one and that privacy was in
aded by a goernmental demand to
know what was done with the road's
money.
Counsellor Folk's brief argues
that the government has complete
supervision over interstate railroads
and that no expenditures can be
properly deemed as private if the
stockholders money is spent. With
out such supervision, railroads can
be wrecked and stockholders ruined,
the brief argues. The court has set

New Objective.
International News Service:
BUME, Aig. 10. The Austrians.
pursued by the Italian cavalry, fol
lowing the fall of Gorizia with the
capture of thousands of prisone-rs,
are reported today to have aban
doned nearly all their chief positions
on the isonzc.
This very indication is that more
success will follow. Occupation of
Gorizia would be precarious if the
Carso plateau remained in
hands, for the city is in
Austrian
a hollow,
surrt unded by steep heights on three
sides and commanded by mountain
peaks on the fourth.
The immediate objective of the
Italians now is Trieste. There is to
he heavy fighting before that city is
taken, because the Austrians have
several positions to fall back upon.
Further reports from the lighting
at Gorizia show that it was of the
most desperate character. House''
were captured one after another b
the Italians, who threw th Austrian
cefenders out of the windows. The
castle was taken at the point of the
bayonet-and the Italian lbig hoisted
on it.
