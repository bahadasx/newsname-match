10. Possibility of a "leak" in
the senate by which an import-
ant state document, supposedly
strictly confidential, was made
a matter of publication, devel-
oped today when Senator Stone,
chairman of the committee on
foreign affairs, demanded an in-

which a confidential copy of the
treaty under which the United
States is to acquire the Danish
West Indies reached the public.
An abstract of the treaty has
already been published and it
was when this was given publica-
tion that the progress of plans to
buy the West Indies from Den-
mark for 25,000,0C0 became
known.
It is believed that the abstract .4
waa made from some one of 25
numbered copies sent to the sen-
ate by Counsellor polk of the 4
state department, who at the
same time requested secrecy un-
til the governments had agreed
to promulgate the treaty.

PASADENA HOTEL MAN
RETURNS TO HONOLULU;
DOES NOT GO NORTH
D. M. Linnard has another float for
the tournament of roses parade in
Pasadena - New Year's Day.' During
his brief stay here today on his way
home from the Orient in the Tenyo
Maru with his daughter, Miss Doro
thy Linnard, he visited several Hono
lulans, including. W. R. Faxrington,
telling them of Japan's offer, for an
addition to the coast city's parade.
It will be remembered that Linnard,
as manager of three Pasadena hotels,
promised two floats for the carnival
in 'Honolulu next spring, when he
passed through here a few weeks ago
on his way to Japan. At that time
Linnard expected to return home by
the northern route but says he want
ed to see a little more of Hawaii.
Linnard draws especial attention to
what James Woods, manager of the
SL Francis hoiel of San Francisco,
said about Honolulu during his recent
visit here.
"I don't know what Woods' plans
are," says Linnard, "but he is dead
right when he says Honolulu's tourist
opportunities are the finest in the
world and that they will not be fully,
realized until there are. better, roads."

heavy artillery to batter down defenses but employed strategy to take
the city.
Before leaving the Austrians made an attempt to destroy their
large military stores and many buildings, setting fire to the store
houses, but the Italians made such quick work of occupying the city
that the fires were put out and most of the stores saved. . J
