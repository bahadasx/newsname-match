POLICE OPPOSE
PENSION PLAN
Firemen Also Fight District
Bill Provision-Want Bet
ter Law or None.
By ANDRW It. 9KELLSY.
Policemen and firemen of the Dis
trict, who are supposed to benefit by
the pension provision in the District
bill, yesterday began a campaign to de
feat the legislation.
"We would rather have no pension
plan adopted at this session than ac
cept this bill." said a number of the
bluecoats who were working quietly at
the Capitol yesterday rounding up
members of Congress to fight the meas
ure.
Their opposition to the present pen
sion bill, which In in the form of an
amendment offered by Senator la Fol
lette. is that "the bill has no teeth.
Summed up, their objections are
based upon the fact that the measure
does not make it compulsory upon the
department executives to retire mem
bers after they have reached the re
quired age and have given the required
length of service, nor does it fix the ar
bitrary amount which the men would
get from the pension fund when they
are retired.
They desire a measure that would give
50 per cent of the annual salary and
would leave no discretionary power with
the Commissioners in the matter of fix
ing the amount.
Further objection is entered to the
amounts fixed in the bill, it being con
tended that aside from the increases
granted the chief *ngineer and the dep
uty chief engineer of the fire depart
ment, the amount allowed all below that
grade Is decreased over that provided
under the existing law.

superintendent and the assistant super

Neither side is now willing to admi
a strike will come to tie up the nation

Judge Chambers, Judge Knapp and Ml

night, and will continue to keep the Presi

railroad managers' committee of eightee
today, the board tomorrow will call I:
the representatives of the 40.000 em

It was learned on good authority toda
that the railroad managers, although ask

succeed and that either Presidential ac

The "Big Four." opposed absolutely t
arbitration, hopes mediation will succeed
but secretly, it is understood, feels th
railroads will not yield sufficiently t
