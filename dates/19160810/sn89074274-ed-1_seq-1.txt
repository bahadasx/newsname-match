Confesses to Murder
Sentenced Same Day
Dickinson, Aug. 7— Frank Lang,
who was convicted this morning in
the Mott court of the murder of L. H.
Larson, a farmer living two miles from
Regent, was sentenced this afternoon
to life imprisonment at the state peni
tentiary.
Dune McGillis, state transportation
agent is expected on No. 1 to bring
the prisoner to bismarck.
Lang was arrested Friday evening
at Dickinson. He was brough,t back
to Mott for trial and then returned
to Dickinson to receive sentence.
According to Lang's story, he and
Larson were en route to a hay field,
when they quarreled over the use of a
whiffletree. Lang claims Larson hit
.'him over the head with a rock and
called him ugly names. In the fight
ensued, Lang is said to have ad
mitted grabbing a scale weight lying
on the wagon and crushing Larson's
skull.
Both were on the hayrack at the
time, and as they fought, the team
ran away, Larson's body being thrown
from the rig. Lang returned to Lar
son's body, tied the hands and feet,
so he couldn't give an alarm, the
prisoner maintaining that he didn't
know Larson had been killed.
Mott, Aug. 7.—"Yes, I did it, but he
hit me with a rock first," was the ad
mission made by Frank Long, alias
Lechowsky, to a representative of the
Mandan Daily Pioneer. He followed
•with a full confession, saying: "Larson
and I had a fight and he picked up a
rock and hit me on the head with it.
I picked up that old weight from a
scale and hit him on the head with it.
I killed him in self defense."
State's Attorney Crane and the sher
iff worked with Long yesterday trying
to get him to make a statement on the
murder of farmer Louis H. Larson last
Thursday night, but it was not until a
Daily Pioneer representative was ad
mitted to the cell with Long that he
finally broke down and made the con
fession. He admitted that he was a
member of the I. W. W., and that he
had three brothers in Chicago and a
sister in Kansas City. He had ap
pealed to the latter for money with
"which to help him out of the trouble.
Armed guards all Saturday night
and Sunday surrounded the Hettinger
county jail prepared to resist the at
tempts of two different parties bent
on laying their hands on Long. I. W.
W. members threatened to mob the
Hettinger county jail and free the con
fessed murderer. The sheriff swore in
a large number of deputies, armed
them, and then rounded up 30 of the
I. W. W. and Saturday night chased
them out of Mott. Sunday seven more
were rounded up and started trekking
for different fields. However, the I. W.
W. have appealed for aid from head
quarters and seek not only reinforce
ments but money with which to wage
the fight for Long's release.
Saturday it became known that a
band of some 150 farmers from the vi
ciniity of Regent had armed them
selves and prepared to come to Mott
to batter in the jail door, seize Long
and stage a lynching bee. The terrific
rain which came up late in the after
noon prevented the crowd from driv
ing across country and the plan fell
through. However, officials of Hettin
ger county expected further demon
stration and as a result continued the
armed guard. The I. W. W. had been
concentrating their forces at Regent
and at other points near Mott, and it
was believed were preparing to rush
the jail and deliver Long.
As a result of the organization of the
I. W. W. and the farmers, it is feared
that a big battle is liable to break out
Pretty Home Ceremony Marks
Marriage of Valley City Girl
A pretty wedding occurred on Mon
day at high noon, when Anna, the eld*
est daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ole An
derson, was given in marriage to John
Edwin Bjorlie, of Page, the wedding
taking place at the Anderson home, at
715 Normal avenue, in the presence of
about 25 relatives.
Promptly at the appointed hour
Miss Agnes Anderson began playing
the beautiful Mendelssohn wedding
march as the bridal party entered the
living room and took their places un
der an effectively arranged bower of
ferns and sweet peas. Preceding the
ceremony Miss Anderson sang "Be
cause," after which' the marriage cere
mony was performed by the Rev. H. O.
Bjorlie, of Sioux Falls, a cousin of the
groom, the ring service being used.
The bride was given in marriage by
her father and was attended by her
sister, Miss Minnie Anderson. Mr.
Bjorlie was supported by his brother,
Gilbert Bjorlie, of Pekin.
The bride wore an exquisite gown
of white georgette crepe combined
with white taffeta, with trimmings of
silver lace and her shower bouquet was
of bride's roses and swainsonia. Miss
Minnie Anderson, the maid of honor,
wore a pretty gown of pale green
georgette crepe and taffeta, trimmed
with gold lace. She wore a corsage
bouquet .of Cecil Bruner roses and
sweet peas.
After the ceremony congratulations
were offered, and the guests then sat
down to an elaborate four-course
luncheon,. served, at. little tables
throughout the rooms and in the din
ing room. The decorations were in

at any time. Never in the history of
southwestern North Dakota have the
farmers and townsmen been aroused
to such a high pitch of indignation.
That a peaceable farmer should have
been slain in cold blood by a wan ad
mittedly a thug with a long criminal
record behind him, a man marked by
the Chicago police department, has
pitched the whole county into a frenzy
of excitement. Talk is rife of the or
ganization of a modern KuKlux to ride
through the country clearing it of the
men who refuse to accept equitable
wages and yet feast off the farmers,
gaining money and food through
threats, thefts highway robbery and
murder.
During the night Long was spirited
away by a large armed force and hur
ried to Dickinson as fast as automo
biles could travel over the muddy
roads. Following his confession made
to the Pioneer representative, and lat
er reduced to writing, it was stated
that Long was ready to appear before
Judge Crawford and plead guilty to the
killing of Larson.

Here During Our Fair
Young Man Near Death
Cooperstown, Aug. 2. Reynold
Rearick has returned home from Red
Lake Falls, Minn. He had been mak
ing various fairs and race meets sell
ing score cards, and at Red Lake
Falls went swimming in the river,
walked off a sand bar into a big hole
and was going down for the third time
when a companion grabbed him by
the hair and hauled him out on the
bank, thereby saving him from drown
ing. After this experience he decided
to come home, where the swimming
holes are more familiar and the "eats"
are served three times a day. Mr.
Rearick was a student at the univer
sity of North Dakota during the last
session.
Rearick was in Valley City during
the fair race meet. He got out the
score card for the mule derby and
made the acquaintance of a number of
Valley City people.

The newspapers of the country
have had intimations from several
sources that the present mobilization
of national guardsmen at the border
was not a mere play spell. In fact,
the serious character of the movement
has been emphasized as strongly as
the military censorship would permit.
In view of this fact, the closing para
graphs of a letter from Corporal Mel
choir, of Company B, are significant:
This is some country cactus of
all kinds and scorpions are common.
I have a big one bottled up and will
send it up if you want it. Spiders are
thick as fleas here and they are sure
stingers. I have been bitten several
times.
The tarantulas are as big as 50
cent pieces and dollars and their
bite is deadly. Big rattlers hang
around and we have killed a few.
Some of the fellows have lizards,
some of which are poisonous. We
have not seen a centipede yet.
Wild deer are running all over
the country. This is the rainy sea
son and insects, snakes, bugs, fleas
and gnats by the millions hang
around. You may think this is put
ting it strong, but it is a lot worse
than I can tell.
We are encamped at Mercedes, Tex.,
five miles from the border. There are
5,000 Mexicans encamped across the
Rio Grande. There is a lot of greasers
hanging around and one gets shot reg
ularly every day. A few sentries have
been stabbed or shot, but only once
in a while. This is a wild country.
I met a Texas ranger the other
day and they are sure tough babies.
The greasers say thew could whip the
United States if they could get past
the rangers. They are just like west
ern cowboys, always on horseback,
and crack shots. They guard the
banks of the river.
A man can kill a Mexican and never
get .into any trouble. A good many
Texas boys have got a man apiece.
There is an old saloon here and it
is a tough joint. I cannot describe it.
You have seen it in a movie. They
shot up the place last night, but no
one was killed.
There are about 15,000 of us, with
the boys from Texas, Minnesota, New
York and Iowa. There are cavalry, in
fantry and supply troops.
The temperature is always between
102 and 108 in the shade and as a re
sult I am burned to a crisp. We all
sweat like rain. All around us is mes
quite brush and cactus, but at that, on
account of our reputation, we got a
choice place.
Tomorrow we are going to hunt
tarantulas and Mexican skulls which
are lying around here. The buzzards
pick them clean in short order.
This is not a bad life. We hit here
in a storm and sure labored to get
camp made. The .vegetation grows
three to five feet in a couple of
weeks during the rainjr season and

in Mexico Very Soon
we had to pitch camp in that grass.
We found tarantulas, scorpions, ad
ders and lizards in the grass, but we
are used to them now.
We brought 17 carloads of army
trucks south and there are 200 more
here. They are turning them out at
the factory at the rate of 75 a day. We
are going to invade Mexico, that's a
cinch.
The general of this division and
some of Funston's officers inspected
camp yesterday and Colonel Fraine
asked how long we were going to
stay.
"Two months," was the reply.
"I suppose you are going to send us
home then," said Col. Fraine.
"No. You are going into Mexico as
soon as you are used to the climate,"
was the officer's response.
Practice marches under every con
dition, and target practice with the
rifles, will be on the program from
now on, instead of the regular drill
held at Fort Lincoln.
For the first two weeks of prac
tice marches they will be increased
from day to day, until the troops are
able to complete a distance of four
miles in an hour. The third week,
haversacks and canteens, filled, will
be carried by the boys, and after the
fifth week the men will be under
heavy marching order.
Target practice on the ranges near
camp will also be held regularly.
More Bros. Secure Big
Territory for Pullman
A. Y. More, of More Brothers, of
Fargo and Wimbledon, automobile and
machinery men, returned Sunday eve
ning from York, Pa., where he spent a
full week at the factory of the Pullman
motor car company, and brought with
him a contract that will give them the
sale of this automobile throughout a
great territory of the northwest.
By the contract More Brothers will
have all of North Dakota, Montana,
Minnesota, including the Twin Cities
and Duluth, and the northern half of
South Dakota.
This arrangement shows how the
eastern manufacturers consider the
northwest as a motor car market.
The Minneapolis branch of the
Fargo office will be in charge of F. G.
Meyers, an expert from the factory.
Mr. More was gone about ten days
and while away made a thorough
study of the Pullman cars in the fac
tory, and of the factory itself. He is
much pleased with the prospects of
the car in this territory and especially
so with the big contract he secured
from the company.

States and .Mexico.
The First North Dakota arrived here
bearing the distinction of being one of
the best equipped militia regiments
reaching the border. The North Da
kotans have also demonstrated them
selves to be among the hardiest and
best drilled soldiers on the border. In
the Minnesota camp and the camps of
the eastern states there has been more
illness and suffering.
Someone Found Haven in
Occident Elevator Office
Sunday morning Ole K. Lee, agent
for the Occident elevator at North Val
ley City, was notified that an office
window had been broken in Saturday
night. On investigation he found that
someone, evidently fearful of the rest
of the working men and transients who
make that section their headquarters,
had used the office for a fortress, the
arsenal being all ready to hand. Mr.
Lee found that someone had entered
by breaking a pane of glass and lift
ing the window. After entrance the
window was barricaded by putting
against it a storm door which was
stored in the office. A cot had been
occupied during the night and on it
was still lying a hatchet which had
been commandeered as a weapon of de
fense, while a rifle was placed near at
hand. All the articles mentioned were
Mr. Lee's property and there were oth
er articles of value, none of which had
been stolen, making it clear that a ref
uge had been sought. The chances are
that the man had good reasons for his
precautions and that Barnes county
was spared the expense of a murder
case.
Isabelle Maria Hollinshead, the be
loved wife of Chas. Hollinshead, Sr.,
passed away on Wednesday, Aug, 2, at
6:30 p. m., at the good old age of 86
years, after a long and painful illness
which she bore with sweet Christian
fortitude in the home where she lived
the greater part of her married life.
In her middle life she was an active
worker in the W. C. T. IT., which she
joined 26 years ago. being one of the
first members of the organization in
Valley City, later being made a life
member.
She gave her heart to her Saviour
in the year 1869 and lived faithful to
her profession until the call came to
come up higher.
Sixty-five years, on April 17, 1851,
occurred the marriage of Chas. Hollins
head, Sr., to Miss Maria Mallory, at
Delavan, Wis., which event was cele
brated last April by a gathering of
relatives and friends which attracted
state-wide attention. Mrs. Hollins
head was born at Dryden, N. Y., April
26, 1831. Mr. Hollishead was born at
Lansing, N. Y., July 10, 1826, After
their marriage they resided on a farm
near Delavan for ten years. They
then removed to Pawnee City, Neb.,
where Mr. Hollinshead engaged in the
mercantile business for five years.
Later they moved to Fargo, where he
dealt in horses. In 1880 they moved
to Valley City, where they lived for 35
years in the residence on Fifth ave
nue from which Mrs. Hollinshead's
spirit finally took its flight. There
were only 17 buildings here at that
time and in the long years that have
passed since then, together they
watched the little hamlet grow into a

Tells How Getchell Prairie
Secured Its Present Name
Editor Times-Record':
I noticed an article in your paper of
Aug. 5, 1916, which refers to J. R.
Getchell as being the man from whom
Getchell Prairie gets its name. I do
not desire to deprive J. R. Getchell of
any honors there may be in this mat
ter, or find fault with the editor of
your paper, but evidently you have
been misinformed. As you are not an
old pioneer, and the writer is, I will
explain from whom Getchell Prairie
got its name.
The writer pre-empted the farm that
J. R. Getchell now lives upon in the
year 1878. He found Uncle Charley
Getchell living at that time on the
farm now occupied by Fred Johnson,
a half mile north of the Getchell
school house, and George Getcb«"
,!~
ing on a farm a half mile east of
Uncle Charley's place. The writer
helped to break up what was then
known as the Getchell farm, which
consisted of a section of land owned
by George Getchell, and a half section
owned by his father, Uncle Charley
Getchell. The furrows were a mile
and a half long, or three miles to the
round trip.
In the year 1881 the writer sold his
farm to P. P. Persons. Later Mr. Per
sons sold this farm to Sim Getchell,
a brother of J. R. Getchell. About the
year 1900 Sim Getchell sold this farm
to his brother, J. R. Getchell, and that
is about the time J. R. Getchell be
came a resident of Barnes county.
Getchell Prairie gets its name from
Uncle Charley Getchell, who has long
since been in his grave, and wTho was
not related to J. R. or Sim Getchell.
Herbert Getchell, of this city, is a
grandson of Uncle Charley Getchell,
and son of George Getchell, both pio
neers of Barnes county.
This can all be vouched for by any
old pioneer of Getchell Prairie.
Respectfully yours,
C. L. WYLIE.

especially commendatory. These are
towns where Mr. Greenwood is well
known and where his ability has been
proven, and are a deserved tribute to
his standing, as a dairy expert.

make a home here and to make a city
good to live in.
There are left one son, Albert, who
resides on a farm near Oriska. There
are three grandchildren: Mrs. Roy
Petty, of Spokane, Wash., who just

which she was held by her many
friends.
Funeral Held Tuesday Morning

nine-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John Koehn, who died on'Sunday aft
