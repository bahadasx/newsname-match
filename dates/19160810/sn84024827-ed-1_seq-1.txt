Wild Excitement Prevails in
Chicago Market, Prices Go
ing Up. Eight Cents Over
Night
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Aug. 9. Giant crop loss
es in tlie United States and Canada
sent the wheat market t'jday nearly
straight skyward. At one time, the
ascent of prices amoutned to 11 3-4
cents a bushel. Trading closed in a
whirl of excitement, showing net gains
of 10 5-8 to 11 3-8 rents, with the
September option at 144 1-4 to 144 1-2
and with December at 148 to 148 3-8.
U. S. Crops Far Short
Something of the strain in
volved and of th far-reaching
consequences may be realized
from the fact that according to
th United States government
crop report, which was the prin
cipal cause of today's extremes,
the domestic yield of wheat for
1916 will be 358.0.00,000 buhsels
smaller than was the case last
year. No such shortage had been
foreseen even by the gloomiest
, prophets.
Canada Also Shy
Mack rust spreading in Canada and
indicating t.'iat the crop there would
he cut down 136. 000,000 bushels from
the 1215 total made the situation still
more acute, as the United States and
Canada have been furnishing six-sevenths
of the world's breadstuffs sup
plies to the countries that in the face
of war difficulties have still been able
to import.
Jumps Eight Cents Over Night
The biggest jump .in prices today
came right at the outset, exactly 8
cents a bushel overnight. Strenuous
efforts to buy cleared the market at
Intervals almost completely bare of
offerings, and forced t.'ie market high
er and higher until the May delivery
touched 1.52 1-2, a price just 1-2 cent
under the topmost level on record in
the violent fluctuations in the first
year of the war
Foreign buying on a huge scale
apparently had much to do with
the extreme prices in the last
hour of today's session. It was es
timated that export business to
day totalled 1.500 000 bushels for
immediate shipment.
Gossip of big individual profits
gained by the sudden rise In the mar
ket were extremely indefinite. The
best ground for guesses was the cir
cumstance that since July 31, the
principal options of wheat here have
risen more than 23 cents a bushel.

Hughes, speaking tonight in the Audi-J
torium here, assailed the administra
tion for its preparedness policy, which
he declared inadequate, asserted that
he regarded "reasonable prepared
ness as a primary duty," and purposed,
if elected, "Vj see that it is discharged
to the credit of the American people."
"We are a spirited people," Mr.
Hughes declared. "We are a people
who can protect ourselves. We are
not too pi'jud to fight."
Much of the nominee's address was
devoted to the Mexican situation and
the railing of the national guard to
service on the border
The administration's embargo on
arms to Mexico was criticized as "fast
and loose no policy."
"I don't think it a rash statement,"
the nominee said, "I think it is war
ranted by the facts to say that any
America? soldier killed in Mexico is
killed by American bullets that we
have let go over the border."
"The. only punishment inflicted was
punishment inflicted on our selves,"
he said. "We punished nobody else.
"A large proportion of the nominee's
address was devoted to reiteration of
his views on the need for industrial
cooperation and preparation fOr com
mercial competition by Europe after
the war.

NEW YORK. Aug. 9 Methods of
serum treatment in cases of infantile
paralysis based on scientific princi
ples and from which beneficial re
sults have been obtaned. were out
lined tonight by Dr. Haven Emerson,
city health commissioner.
One of these methods, the commis
sioner , stated, consists of using the
fluid withdrawn by spinal puncture
and reinjected suhcutaneously or in
tramuscularly into the same patient.
Another method is spinal injections
of blood serum derived from persons
who have recovered from the disease.
The first treatment described by the
commissioner as one of "active Immu
nization" is based on the assumption
that the spinal fluid taken from the
patient contains the virus of the dis
ease which when injected suhcutane
ously or intramuscularly will stimulate
the production of antibodies which
will aid overcoming the infection.
The blood serum derived from con
valescents, he pointed out. contains
antibodies whith also will aid in
overcoming Infection. The new high
record of 57 deaths today resulted lu
a decision to postpone the opening ot
the public schools set for September
