purposed, if elected, "to see that It in
discharged to lite credit of the Amer
ican people"
"We are a spirited people," Mr.
dlugbes declared. "Wo are a peopn
who can protect out selves. Wo are
'nut loo proud to f'Kht."
Much of the nominee's address was
id -voted lo the Mexican situullon and
I the ciillihK of the national guard to
(service on the border. There had
i been warnings for two years that

j 'The only punishment Inflicted was
I punishment Intllcted on ourselves,"

1 A large proportion of (lis nominee's
'address was devoted to reiteration of
