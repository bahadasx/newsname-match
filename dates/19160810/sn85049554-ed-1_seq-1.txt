powerful enemy work, there taking 141
prisoners, but the adversary had placed

bombs which exploded, giving off clouds
of poisonous gases as our troops en
tered the lines.
"The enemy then made counter at
tacks and our troops stuplfied by the
-i' gas/were forced to fall back to their
own trenches.
"On Aug. 5, the artillery sounded the
enemy's whole front with the ofbject
of distracting his attention and fixing
li* the ranges accurately.
Splendid Artillery Execution.
"On the morning of Aug. 6 our bat
terles opened fire simultaneously on
the rocky barrier, which from Sabotlno
to Cavalro defends the Isonzo and
Gorizia to the west, and against Monte
San Mlchele, which forms the northern
edge of the Gorlzlan Carso. The ar

®Hrful'ly worked out, represented a per

against fortified lines.
"The positions of the enemy had all
Ipibeen marked, off clearly on target maps
fe and ranges, and the extension and
1 &S51engthenirig of fire had been calculated
'^with the greatest nicety. Thus at the

which the Unied States would acquire
the Danish West Indies for $25,000,
000, recently signed by Secretary Lan
sing and Danish Minister Brun, now is
before the senate foreign relations
committee and probably will be con
sldcrud early next week. It became
known today that the treaty was sent
to the senate in executive session
Tuesday, and was referred to the com
mittee without discussion.
The terms of the convention are to
be considered confidentially until both

Senator Stone in the senate this aft
ernoon demanded investigation of the
means by which a confidental copy of
the treaty, under which the United
States would acquire the Danish West
Indies for $25,000,000, became public.
An abstract of the treaty published
this morning-is- believed to hhve been
made from one of twenty-live num
bered copies sent to the senate Tuesday
by the state department with a letter
transmitting a request from the Danish
government that the terms of the
treaty be withheld.

Wiped Out and Seventy-Five In*
habitants Drowned Hundreds Ma­
rooned on High Lands in Cabin
Creek Valley Without Food—Excur­
sion Train Safe.
Huntington, W. Va., Aus. 10.—A re
port reached here this morning to the
effect that Jarolds Valley, a town of
500 inhabitants in Boone county, at the
head of the Coal river, was washbj
away in yesterday's cloudburst and
that seventy-five of its inhabitants ha'l
loft their lives.
That section of Jarolds Valley be
tween Fipldsi and Jose creeks was
swept clean by the waters, according
to the reports here. It is said that at
least 500 houses were washed away.
Inhabitants had no warning of the ap
proach of the water and it is believed
the loss of life may be even greater
than that on Paint and Cabin creeks.
More than 2,000 residents of the val
ley are perched on the hill top:', all in
danger of starvation.
MANY BODIES RECOVERED.
Whole Mining Camps Wiped Out by
Torrents Which Sweep Down Valleys.
Charleston, W. Va.t Aug. 10.—Twen
ty-three bodies have been recovered
from the debris carried down by the
flood which swept the Cabin CreeK
valley near here yesterday. Rescue
parties have penetrated some distance
above Cabin Creek Junction and mea
ger reports indicate that the loss of life
has been heavy, altho no accurate es
timate can be made.
Persons driven from their homes to
the mountains are returning to find
whole villages of mining camps swept
away, while distress and suffering ate
seen on every hand.
Two companies of the West Virginia
Infantry left Camp Kanawha Jj*. trol
ley this morning and were ^taken 'to
Ga^flk..Greek Junction with orders to
penetrate the valley and extend rellet
to all who need it. They carried provi
sions and tents.
Hunting For Destitute.
A special train was being made up
here cn the Chesapeake & Ohio rail
road and will 'go as far as the hastily
repaired tracks will permit. From that
point a. number of men provided with
provisions will seek oot the spots
where destitution is 'most pronounced.
Reports reached here today from
United States Commissioner Howard
C. Smith, who led a relief party for
a number of mining companies last
night, that looting had commenced and
a number of arrests had been made
and some property recovered.
The commander of the military has
been ordered to detail men to guard
property and restore order, leaving tho
relief work to volunteer parties.
So great has been the loss that coal
companies estimate that many thou
sands of dollars will be needed to feed
and clothe the miners and their fami
lies.
Says Forty Were Drowned.
R. Jacko, a telephone lineman,
reached Cabin Creek Junction shortly
before noon after a walk over thirteen
miles of the company's lines. He de
clared that forty persons had been
drowned and half that number of
bodies had been recovered.
Jacko had been unable to get up thu
Kayford branch of the C. & O. railroad,
but expressed the belief that damag?
and loss of life in that district was
greater than in other sections.
The entire valley between Miami
and DeSota was devastated, he said,
everything movable having been
washed away.
Excursion Train Marooned.
The excursion train carrying 410
persons marooned by the flood was lo
cated between Main Horse creek and
Little Horse creek, with washouts on
both sides. Relief was tient from S^
Albans. Women and children consti
tute the majority of the excursionists.
Soon after 11 o'clock the soldiers
reached Ronda, where headquarters
were established. At that hour an es
timate of the dead remained at 100, but
those responsible for the-statement ad
mitted it was only an estimate.

CAUCUS ON REVENUE BILL.
Senate Democrats to Consider Finance
Committee Recommendations.
Washington, Aug. 10.—Uecoinmend
ations of the senate finance commit
tee on the house revenue bill will be
passed on tonight by a caucu» of sen
ate democrats. Among the amend
ments suggested are those to reduce
the exemptions on income taxes, in
crease the tax on large inheritances,
continue in effect a number of present
stamp taxes, and revise the wine tax
schedule. The committee today had
before it discussion of proposals for
.munition taxes, which have been op
posed vigorously by the manufactur
ers.
Republicans of the senate in confer
ence today declined to accept -the leg
islative program submitted yesterday
by the democratic steering committee,
with a view to adjournment of con
gress before Sept. 1. Those inclined
to agree were outvoted by senators de
manding action on the immigration
bill at this session.
After two hours deliberation on
the democratic proposal that no con
tested legislation be taken up except
the shipping, revenue and workmen's
compensation bills and .conference re
ports, the republican conference
adopted a resolution" declaring:
"The power to cttptrol both legis
lation and adjournment rests with the
democratic majority^ The republican
members urge thatf the immigration
bill hall be taken uj) considered, and
acted on at this session."
The compromise ,program of the
democrats would have eliminated
from the programr
v'one
meaurc in
which many progressive senators are
interested, the corrupt practice bill,
and they are said to have Insisted in
the conference today that they would
be party to no agreement which would
prevent them from demanding a vote
on that measure.
DARING ESCAPE FROM PRISON.
Two Convicts at Fort Madison Gain
Freedom by Using- Electric Wires.
Fort Madison, Ai®f. 10.—One of the
most daring and Ingenious escapes that
has ever lje«n efffcted from the stato
prision at this city, occurred Tuesday
evening when two convicts, William
Fitzpatrick, serving time for robbery,
and Frank Russell, defying a sentence
for breaking, and^jsnterittg, went over
walls on electric wires. The escape
occurred at about 8 o'clock. Altho
guards combed the dounrry In the vi
cinity of the state jrison for hours dur
ing the night, no trace of the two con
victs could be found.
The escape of thei two .convicts was
seei|,byMwa:.:^,F. Rttter. who -resides
af l^Ifth and 'olive streets. She saw
the two men go ov^ci the waH&aad im
mediately ^otlfied i&y" p.ijsoh ..authori
ties. Before she could -noHfy ^he pris
on officials the men had dU«ppeared.
The escape wAs the result of many
days of planning. William Fitzpatrick
was employed as engineer at the power
plant while Russell was an electrician
at the prison. It appears that Fitzpat
rick pulled the fuse on tho electric wir«
in the "tunnel" near the power plant
which put out the lights in the prison.
He sent word to the office to have
Russell repair the Wires.
After the arrival of Russell the tw
men began to carry out their plan to
escape. They succeeded In. climbing
up the side of the building and went
over the line of electric wires to the
wall. Then they cut the wires so
they would stretch to the ground out
ride of the wall. Both men went down
the wires and escaped.

Refuse to Modify Demands
In First Conference With
Federal Mediators.
WILL NOT ACCEPT
OF ARBITRATION
Railway Employes to Refuse to Submit
Disputes to Non-Partisan Board if
Mediation Fails, Declaring Arbitra*
tion Is Abortive—Appeal to President
to Avert Strike Will Be La*t Resort
if Other Plans Fail.
New York, Aug. 10. The United
States board of mediation and concilia
tion held its flrft conference today with
the representatives of the four railroad
brotherhood^ of employes In its ef
forts to prevent thru mediation
country-wide strike to enforce the em
ployes' demand for an eight-hour day
and time and a half for overtime.
Nothing was officially disclosed as to
the successi the mediators met with,
but It was learned on good authority
that the brotherhoods had shown uc
disposition to modify their demands.
"The status is unchanged." was th^t
only comment which A. B. Garretson,
head ot the conductors' brotherhood,
was wilting to make after the confer
ence.
New York, Aug. 10.—The United
States board of mediation and concil
iation intends to hold its first confer
ence today with the committeo rep
resenting the four brotherhoods of
railroad empleyes, in their attempt to
mediate the troubles between the men
and the railroads over the demand
for an eight hour day and extra pay
for overtime.
The mediation commission held the
first conference with the railroad
managers yesterday. W. L. Cham
bers, one of tho mediators, said
atterwara that the railroad managers
told the mediation board how far
they vvere prepared to go In an at
tempt to avoid a strike, and the man
agers mado their side of the argu
ment plain. Mr. Chambers said the
mediators would have a much better
idea of the situation after' talking
with the employes committee today.
Three Possible Results.
There are 'three' possible results of
the mediittloA. 'One- is that -the fed-*
eral board will be able to-g-t the man
agers and workers to sign the agree
ment. The other Is that the board
may get both parties to consent to ar
bitration If mediation falls. The
third possibility is that the federal
board will fall in both these endeav
ors.
It was predicted today that if the
board could not compose the differ
ences PreiVdent Wilson would ask rep
resentatives of the contending fac
tions to meet him and that he would
ask them to arbitrate their differ
ences.
Prefer Mediation to Arbitration.
It is understood that the labor
leaders pin their hopes of settling
the dlsputn upon mediation rather
than arbitration, now that the man
agers have failed to asree with them.
They are opposed to arbitration.
W. S. Carter, president of the Bro
therhood of T.ocomotive Firemen and
Enginmen, said:
"Arbitration is a gambling game,
even when the dice are not loaded.
Railway employes have lost faith in
the justice of arbitration boards.
Thev believe arbitration is as fickle
as chance. If there Is arbitration of
this eight hour demand and every
effort is made to appoint neutrals, it
is but tossing pennies to decide the
question. Why has none suggested
that the matter be suggested by 'pull
ing straws' and relieve everybody
the bother?"
MOUNT ANTI-AIRSHIP GUNS.

New York, Aug. 10.—The battleship

railroad heads and their trainmen. A
strike of the latter would paralyse
practically every Industry In the
United States.'
No one desires to see such a situ
ation brought about. Its effects would
be felt in this country for months off.
The losses occasioned by it would
mount into tens of millions of dollars.
The railroads and the trainmen alone
have a full understanding of the con
ditions. Each side knows whether
there Is really Justice In the claims of
the other.
Common sense and *wber judgment
."hould prevail In tholr final negotia
tions and there ought to be given the
strongest consideration to the public
welfare. The real sufferers from a
rail strike would be the great mass of
the people.—Chicago Drovers' Journal.
Hard on Meat Retailers.
Retailers of meat all over the coun
try are "going to the wall" by the
score. Each succeeding week reduces
the list of packers' customers and
wholesalers gaze ruefully at the losses
owing to delinquents. High cost of
meat and hot weather have been elim
inating factors, but the fact sticks out
prominently that meat retailing has
been overdone.
The consuming public Is complaining
of excessive cost, even when stock and
values are taken into consideration.
Retailers retort that they are not get
ting rich. Probably not, but the rea
son Is excessive overhead charges.
Beef, pork and mutton can not be
vended on the same basis as whisky,
without regard to overhead cost. Cur
rent elimination of retailers Is a
healthy sign. Cattle have had a sharp
decline recently, but beef cost to the
public has been maintained sVnrply be
cause overhead charges made It nec
essary.
Retail cost of meat ought to he regu
lated by the price of cattle, hogs and
sheep, not by such Items as rent, labor
and Ice, which are either fixed or
working upward.—Chicago Live Stock
