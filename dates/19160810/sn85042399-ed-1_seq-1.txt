Commercial Club Rejects Death
And Inaugurates Radical Changes
The solid, concerted, unanimous
chorus of "aye" which answered
President Smith's query of "all op
posed to turning the assets and lia
bilities of the Commercial Club over
to a new organization" spoke elo
quently of the new spirit which is per
meating Ashland and showed pre
eminently that the movement insti
gated by the young men of Ashland
who backed the celebration and the
roundup and made It a success had
accomplished Its purpose. At Mon
day evening's Commercial Club meet
ing, H. O. Frohbach, representing
the group of young business men who
some time ago decided to either
arouse the Commercial Club to a new
energy or else organize a new Cham
ber of Commerce to take over the
mission of the Commercial Club, real
izing that the club might pull itself
out eventually but wishing to hasten
matters, placed the matter squarely
before the club, stating that the pro
posed Chamber of Commerce stood
ready to take over the assets and the
liabilities of the club and outlined
the radical changes which would be
made. He made It plain, however,
that in case the club refused the
proposition the chamber would not
be formed. The fact that the club
room was crowded while for the past
two months only a baker's dozen have
been present at meetings, gave a pre
monition of the realization that the
club was being aroused instead of
killed off, and the unanimous rejec
tion of the proposal marked the ar
rival at the aim of the young men,
the awakening of the organization
which represents Ashland.
The 'group which proposed the
Chamber of Commerce will no doubt
now throw themselves heart and soul
into the Commercial Club work, and,
in tact, two of the Eisners of the
Chamber of Comemrce proposal were
elected trustees of the new Commer
cial Club and will aid in the reorgan
ization of the club which will foll6w
the sweeping changes inaugurated at
Monday's meeting.
As J. W. McCoy remarked during
the argument which preceded the
vote of rejection, "Practically every
Mg project which Ashland has carried
through has seen its inception in the
Ashland Commercial Club." "The
present financial state of the club is
an Indication of the fact that we have
accomplished things."
The Commercial Club Is Just now
getting on Its feet after financial out
lays which were a little more than
the club should have undertaken,
bad plunged it into a large debt.
During the past several months the
club has been short of money because
' of an attempt to clear up Its indebt
edness and because of the inactivity
which naturally resulted from lack
of funds, interest in the club has
waned and the membership dwindled.
At present the club is in a sound con
dition. According to Secretary
Shinn's report, the indebtedness of
the club on August 7, 1916, was
$253.60, against which there Is an
offset ok $76 collected already this
month. There is due the club for
outstanding dues $540, the greatest
proportion of which is believed to be
collectible. In addition to this, the
club owns a billiard and pool table
and other furniture which it has been
voted to do away with, and these
Bhould bring way above the amount
. . . . . j At Va 1inat nolnillfl-
oi inaeDieuiieBo at wo
tion. It may thus be seen that the
Commercial Club Is ahead of the
game financially, has undertaken
changes which will keep it so, and
will supply a fund to be called upon
for the many small amounts which
are now taken care of by subscrlp-
Resolution Calls
For New Station
In view of the new spirit which Is
awakening in Ashland and the ex
pansion which the city is undergoing
and anticipates within the next year,
the Commercial Club at their Monday
meeting passed a resolution as fol
lows: "Be It resolved, that, In considera
tion of the Important steps taken by
the city of Ashland, in their expendi
ture of $175,000 for the development
of Lithia park and the bringing m
of Uthla and sulphur waters, the Ash
land Commercial Club ask the co
operation of the Southern Pacific
railway to the extent of erecting a
new depot and improvement of their
grounds in this city."
Hons from the merchants, has enlist
ed the interest of the young business
men, the live fellows who "put
across" Ashland's celebration, and
should within the next two months
take its rightful place in Ashland.
The changes which are to be made
are sweeping in their extent and in
clude those suggested In the recom
mendations made by a committee ap
pointed for the purpose some time
ago.
The most radical changes Include
the disposal of the billiard and card
tables, enlargement of the board of
truseees to twelve members, and re
moval to new quarters In the city
hall.
The proceeds from the sale of the
tables will be used to place the club
above the board financially. This
feature of the club has long been los
ing in favor among the business men
who realize that the Commercial Club
should be a place to do things rather
than to play billiards.
At the last meeting of the city
council the council Indicated its wil
lingness to remodel the storeroom in
the west end of the city hall Into an
office for the Commercial Club. The
club will ask the council to allow
them the use of this, water and lights
and the use of the council chamber
upstairs, which, by the way, will be
fitted up by the commercial club's
chairs and other fittings, thus saving
an overhead expense of $35 a month,
which alone is a big Item.
A determined campaign for new
members will be made. The new
club hopes to be able to produce re
sults and needs every man In Ashland
and every property owner within Ash
land or living elsewhere as a member.
The amended charter provides for
election of officers yearly instead of
every six months, a board of twelve
trustees instead of five, weekly meet
ings of the trustees to transact all
ordinary business, that all commit-
tee chairman be selected from board 1 wno will be here for a four days' re
members. The club's finances are . unjon beginning September 11. The
dealt with specially In a paragraph j encampment will be held in Chautau-
limltlng Indebtedness to $500. It isiqua park an(j over two hundred G.
recommended that publicity work bej. r., Spanish war veterans, Indian
done at public expense ny a puniiciwar veterans and pioneers are ex

In line with the new charter pro-1
vision for trustees, half of whom are
to be chosen every six months, the
following were elected to serve till
November: J. W. McCoy, W. E.
Newcombe, G. H. Billings, H. O.
Frohbach, Henry Enders. To serve
till May: C. B. Lamkln, C. W. Banta,
F. H. Walker, C. B. Wolf, M. C.
Reed. These ten, together with old
trustees, Fred Wagner, Hal McNalr,
President Smith and Vice-President
Jordan, ex-offlclo, constitute the
board of trustees for the present. .
San Franciscans
Will Be Here Soon
One of the biggest business men's
excursions of the year is the San
Francisco merchants' excursion to
Coos Bay which will pass through
Ashland on the trip to Marshfleld on
August 20, and returning on the
26th of August will stop off for a
two hours' stay in Ashland. H. P.
Adams was here recently arranging
the itinerary of the excursion, and
plans were made for Ashland to send
autoB to meet the party at Medford
at 3.45 and bring them up through
the valley to Ashland, taking them
through Lithia park and then turn
ing them loose to visit the mer
chants of the city. Other entertain
ment may be arranged by the com
mittee which has been apppolnted
from the Ashland Commercial Club.
The excursion will be made up of
about one hundred of the leading
business men of the bay metropolis,
They will be the heads of the firms
and many of the biggest men of Cali
fornia will be in the party. While
here they will visit the merchants,
one of the main almB of the trip be
ing to foster business relations. The
party travels In their own special
train.
Ashland should give this party a
great reception. Every one of these
men will be men who yearly seek for
new places for vacations and to send
their families for the summer. Not
only that, but they are men who can
do a great deal and will do a great
deal to advertise Ashland as a resort
city should they be given the hospit
able welcome of which Ashland is
capable.

Addresses The
Commercial Club
Prof. Deschamps of Paris, France,
who Is spending a few months in
Ashland mainly for health considera
tions, delivered a greatly appreciated
talk before the Commercial Club
Monday evening. Prof. Dessbamps
is a lecturer of more than national
note and has been touring the west
lecturing prior to his stop here for
a rest. He will return to France
next spring. The professor delivered
an energizing talk to the room full of
Commercial Club members. He dwelt
considerably upon the natural beau
ties of which Ashland possesses bo
many and suggested several things
which Ashland should work for at
once. He called his hearers' atten
tion to the need of a sanitarium,
apartment houses and more accom
modations for visitors, saying, "You
must have the places to put them,
before you get the victors.' He made
an urgent appeal for co-operation and
to Ashlanders to shake off the leth
argy which prevents progress.
Heavy Travel Over
Siskiyou Highway
According to the monthly report of
State Highway Engineer John L.
Lewis,, ,639yehlcles passed over the
SlsklW-grade during the month of
June. Two hundred and forty-five
was the greatest number in a single
day.
War Veterans Will .
Camp Here in Sept.
James Mattingly appeared before
the Commercial Club at Monday's
meeting and asked the club for Its
co-operation in the entertainment of
the old soldiers and sailors of south
ern Oregon and northern California
counties. The Commercial Club ap-
nomted a committee to assist in ar-
ranging for the entertainment of the
visitors.
Irrigation or
No Sugar Factory
The party of officials of the Utah
Idaho Sugar Company who thorough'
j ly went over the valley last week
have informed the Medford Commer
cial Club that the erection of a sugar
factory at Medford or other point in
the upper valley will depend upon the
extension of Irrigation In the valley,
If the proposed high line ditch is put
through under the district plan about
August 1 next, and an acreage of
good proportions is placed under wa
ter from the ditch, they will put a
proposition for the erection of a fac
tory before the people of Medford.
The Rogue River valley, said T
R. Cutler, vice-president and general
manager of the company, is well suit
ed ; as to soil and climate for the
growing of beets. However, he ex
plained, he and his associates had
found after carefully examining all
the beet acreage in the valley that
non-lrrlgated beets are already
shrinking and the tops beginning to
wilt, whereas the irrigated beets are
showing up splendidly and through
this sunshiny weather are showing
Increased gains.
A sugar factory cannot continue to
operate, he continued, unless the
beets can be grown profitably by the
farmers. Investigation convinced
him that they cannot be grown in
sufficient tonnage and high enough
sugar content without irrigation, to
be profitable to the farmer.
Baptist Pastor
Leaves September 1
Rev. Arthur Blackstone of the Bap
tist church will give up the pastorate
on September 1, his resignation hav
ing been handed in some time ago,
Mr. Blackstone has built up the
church during his pastorate and ha
won the friendship of a host of Ash
landers not church members as well.
His plans for the future are not fully
determined.
Friends Say Bill
Carries Horseshoe
Bill Loomls's friends claim that
Bill carries a horseshoe under the
back seat along with the extra inner
tubes and tools. The conviction
would seem to be bourne out by the
lucky escape which Mr. Loomis and a
carload of passengers underwent on
the Siskiyou grade last Sunday.
Three miles beyond the summit when
he was turning around the engine
"died." When he cranked up the
reverse gear stuck tfiid the car backed
over the grade and down an embank
ment 150 feet to the bottom of a
canyon, the car turning over three
times. On the second turn Mrs.
Loomls's mother, Mrs. Humphrey,
and Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Cox were
thrown out and on the third turn
Mr. I.oomls went out. All escaped
Injury except Mrs. Cox, who was only
slightly bruised. The car was lifted
to the road with a block and tackle
and will be in commlsion again after
undergoing repairs that will cost per
haps $25.
Bass Horn Band
Dance Tonight
Remember to drop up to the Bun
galow tonight. The band boys are
staging another "bass horn" dance
and will give you a pleasant evening
in return for a few cents towards a
horn. Five-piece orchestra of the
beBt musicians In the city. Every
body Is going.
More Soldier Boys
Bound for Border
Under the direction of A. D. Wick,
traveling passenger agent for the
Southern Pacific with headquarters
at Portland, 165 newly recruited mil
itiamen went south yesterday bound
foty border, where they will Join
the -companies for which they have
denoted their preference. These
boys have all been recruited since
the militiamen went to the border
and have underwent training at
Clackamas and are ready for service.
Others will follow later until the
various companies are up to standard
In numbers. ' '
Two Signs Which
Should Be at
Camp
Between fifteen and twenty-five
automobile parties camp at the Ash
land auto camp every night. There
are two signs which should be placed
in the camp In a prominent place for
the purpose of acquainting the visit
ors with the two biggest features of
Ashland as a watering resort.
One sign should point to the path
toward the lithia fountain, with the
words. "Two blocks to the lithia
fountain. Follow the lighted path."
Then none of the campers would
overlook a visit to the fountain, as
many now do because of lack of
knowledge of the fountain.
The second sign should read:
"Hot sulphur tub and plunge baths,
Jitney leaves 7:30 p. m. Fare 10
cents." No doubt the Natatorlum
and Helman's baths would put up
the price of this sign and would make
arrangements with drivers of Jitneys
to visit the camp ground every even
ing. If the business Justified, more
frequent trips could be made,.
Auto tourists who come to Ashland
to stay a few days will eventually
find out these things for themselves,
but the tourist who stops one night
only may not. A sulphur tub or
plunge -will appeal to nearly every
one of the autolsts and will be re
membered as part of Ashland.
Stuck Knife In
Chest While Drunk
Thomas Warren was one of the
passengers on the special train which
brought back the baseball rooters
from Weed last Sunday. Thomas
was slightly under the influence of
the fiery firewater of the lumber
town. Thomas was so drunk that he
did not know exactly what he was
doing. Thomas got out his knife and
stuck it Into his chest. Thomas
wounded himself severely. . Thomas
was taken to the Sacred Heart hos
pital at Medford, from which he was
released Tuesday a wiser Tom.
Two Hundred Former Residents of
Dixieland Gather in Lithia Park
A ToiiNt to Dixie anil Oregon.
The birthland is the loved land,
That's the way of the mortal heart.
So Dixie lund our loved land
To you.
Childhood days are care-free days,
That's the way of mortal life.
So Dixie days, our childhood days,
To you.
The last of life is the best of life,
The traveler chooses his path.
So Oregon land, our last days, our
best days,
To you. By Angelina.
"Dixie," sung as the rousing south
ern air has never before been sung in
Ashland, sung straight from the
hearts of two hundred folks from the
sunny south who were transported In
memory back to the homeland of
flowers and perpetual summer,
aroused the echoes in the hills which
hem in Lithia Park, Wednesday even
ing at the close of a gathering truly
southern.
From every part of the valley and
from distant points as well, the for
mer residents of the southern states,
who have learned to love Oregon and
the Rogue River valley until It has a
place In their hearts alongside of be
loved Dixie, came to meet each other
and with reminiscence and renewal of
old friendships and making of new,
bind closer together the residents of
this country who are from the south.
Late in the afternoon the gather
ing was called to order by President
John H, Dill of the Dixie Association
of the valley, who requested M. C.
Reed, chairman of the program com
mittee, to preside.
R. P. Campbell opened the program
with a reading from James Whltcomb
Riley, playing upon the emotions of
his hearers with that consummate art
which Is making "Dick Tosey" a val
ley favorite.
President Dill then gave the ad
dress of welcome with a warmth
which made every southerner present
feel that he was the friend of every

grades. Oh, how these school ladles
come and go. Like the great Ger

Blue Ledge Mine
Owner Dead
News was received in Medford
Tuesday night of the death of Rob
ert Sanford Towne In New York. Mr.
Towne was the owner of the Blue
Ledge mines and a millionaire mine
owner with interests all over the
world. S. S. Bullls told the Medford
paper that he was not surprised to
learn of Mr. Towne's death as the
capitalist was very low upon his re
cent viBit to the east. In Mr. Bullls'
opinion the fact of Mr. Towne's 111
health has held back the Blue Ledge
development and his death will prob
ably result In active work at the
mines, as his Interests are known to
be in competent hands and well or
ganized. Mr. Towne died at the Engineers'
Club, where he made his home, and
the New York Times account of his
death devotes considerable space to
his extensive mining Interests In Mex
ico and this country. Mr. Towne was
president of the Mexican Northern
railway, president of the Alvarez
Land and Timber Company, president
of the Sresnillo Mining Company, the
Mexican Lead Company, the PotOsl
and Rio Verde railway, the Montezu
ma Lead Company, the Soubrette
Mining Company, the Companla Met
alurgica Mexican!, and interested ex
tensively In a dozen other large min
ing concerns. A graduate of Ohio
State University In the class of 1879,
Mr. Towne was one of the most suc
cessful mining engineers in the coun
try and amassed a tremendous for
tune. He was a member of the New
York Yacht Club, the Engineers and
Lawyers Club, and took a prominent
part In the American Institute of
Mining Engineers.

George H. Himes, secretary of the

The program was followed by a
picnic dinner with delicacies of the
south much in evidence.
After the program reminiscences

Fire Burns Talent
Packing Plant
Fire of an unknown origin, but
presumably caused by defective elec
tric light wiring, destroyed the pack
ing house of C. M. Thomas at Talent
Wednesday night, about 10 o'clock,
causing a property damage estimated
at $5,000, partially covered by insur
ance. The building and contents
were totally destroyed.
Two days' pack of Bartlett pears,
being made ready for shipment, a
carload of box material, and a quan
tity of fruit wrapping paper went up
In smoke. It was the supply for the
season, and thus the loss fulls heavy.
When discovered the building was
a mass of flames, and the fire-fighting
equipment at hand was unable to
cope with the blaze, which was visi
ble in this city.
