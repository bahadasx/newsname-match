WORLD—VOLUME VI. NUMBER 32
NEWSPAPER BOYS OF STATE
MEET FOR THREE DAYS OUT
ING AT LAKE METIGOSCHE.
The annual summer meeting of the
North Dakota Press Association was
held at Lake Metigosche, about six
teen miles from Bottineau, and al
though the weather was bad on ac
count of heavy rains, the fact remain*
that those present had a most enjoy
able time. The newspaper fratenity
began to arrive at Bottineau Thurs
day evening and were transported to
the lake by autos, which were plying
back and forth all the time to take
care of the editors and their ladies.
Out at the lake is a good hotel and
many beautiful cottages, where all
were made at home, and where they
had three days of real enjoyment.
There was boating and bathing, and
other amusements. The Bottineau
military band was there and furnish
ed some good music, and a good prog
ram was carried out. A large pavil
lion had been put up under which the
meetings were held and the banquet
also. Heavy rains both Thursday and
Friday made the roads to the lake
very bad and therefore in a measure
interferred with the pleasure of some,
but we believe that there was not one
who attended but went home feeling
that he had had a good time and ther
good people of Bottineau had done
themselves proud. The business
meeting was held Friday and Satur
day forenoon and the balance of the
time was given over to pleasure. The
banquet was held on Saturday even
ing and was a most pleasant social
affair. Sunday there was devotional
exercises and in the afternoon several
of the party left by auto for Towner,
about 35 miles away, where they took
the train for their several homes. Lake
Metigosche is one of the beauty^ots
of North Dakota and was a' pleasant
surprise to many of the newspaper
people who had never had the pleasure
of visiting this resort. There are good
hotel accommodations and dozens of
beautiful cottages occupied by people
from vairous parts of the state. There
are launches and row boats, and all in
all it is an ideal place to go and en
joy a few days recreation and rest.
That the people of Bottineau ap'
predated the coming of the newspaper
boys to their little city, goes without
saying, as they did everything possi
ble to give them a royal time Prac
tically every auto in the city was iat
the disposal of the visitors.

Devils Lake, N. D., Aug. 3.—Fargo
Forum: The Devils Lake Journal of
July 26 contains the following editor
ial comment on the policy of the IT.
S. since Mr. Wilson has been presi
dent:
"The simple little query of 'Well,
what would you have done with Mex
ico if you would have been president?'
is destined to put an abrupt end to a
good many amature political debates
this campaign."
I stated to Mr. Bryan two years ago
in Washington what I would do, and
am certainly willing to do so now in
view of the past two years. Had not'
Europe, been convulsed in war, Eng
land, Germany and France would have
been in Mexico long ago if we had not
done something to indicate that we
considiered the Monroe doctrine wor
thy of our support.
Due to the war in Europe, if I had
been in Mr. Wilson's place,* I would
have asked the leading South Ameri
can republics to furnish their respec
tive contingent of troops, if necessary
advanced money to aid them to this
end, and'United States, placed in Mex
ico 50,000 troops, we furnishing at
least 25,000 of this force, to establish
order and restore peace and prosper
ity to this outlawed nation had each
nation sent a commissioner, thus form,
ing aboard whose duty it should be to
jointly administer the affairs .of Mex
ico, collect duties, and direct under
civil functions the action of the armed
forces until order was restored and as
near as possible a stable form of gov
ernment established, extending to
Mexico directly, or guaranteeing such
financial aid as necessary to relieve
her financial embarrassment, which
glad to extend, similar to the joint ac
tion of the world's nations in the Box
er movement in China.
Each .commissioner to have equal
power and thus guaranteeing the in
tegrity of Mexico and with such a
show of force, this country would not
have dared oppose joint occupation by
North and South American republics.
There are fifteen million people in
Mexico, five million Indians, five mil
lion breeds and three million whites,
ignorant and incompetent to vote are
the large majority, a few unprincipled
men—outlaws and adventurers have
deld sway' for four years, robbing and
ravishing the nation—with the poo:
ignorant peons at their mercy. Not
only have American citizens been
murdered in cold blood, but Mexican
bandits have invaded our soil, mur
dered our. women and children as well
as men,burned our houses, driven off
thousands of head of stock.
Mr. Wilson has pursued' a policy
never before experienced by the Asia
tics, unwritten by Grotius, the father
of international law, and since with
out precedent. As long ias we did not
intervene It was none of oar business
who was president of Mexico. Huerta
should have been recognized. Under
a nation's'well defined right he had
been elected. With as much logic
could Mr. Wilson written over to the
kaiser and said: "I don't like your
submarine policy, you have committed
murder without warrant and I demand
that you resign—call an election for a
new ruler, but you are not eligible."
Paul, emperor of Russia, was stran
gled—his brother Alexander succeed
ed him by a cold-blooded murder, yet
Europe was silent. It is a well de
fined law that a sovereign nation re
cognizes no power in the administra
tion of its affairs but its own dis
cretionary action and God. Unless
we actively intervened by force of
arms, we should not have meddled
with the internal affairs of Mexico.

Handled Meiican Situation
Mr. Wilson has always claimed that
he did not want war with Mexico.
Very well then, why take Vera Cruz
—and later invade Mexico to capture
Villa which on its face was a farce?
No, Mr. Wilson should have, from
his standpoint of "no war", had two

warships on the east coast, two on the
west coast, and 25,000 men on Bio
Grande land border to keep the ban
dits out of this country and protect
all foreign citizens when occasion
arose. Huerta did not salute the flag,
Vijla murdered American citizens at
Columbus with guns we gave him.
Carranza did the same thing when the
Tenth cavalry was simply massacred
at Parral and now the Mexican peo
ple believe us cowards, desiring an
nexation but too feeble and cowardly
to effect it, and if it were not for
Texas, that they could march into, and
capture the United States.
My cousin, Enrique C. Creel (son
in-law of General Terrazas, the rich
est man in Mexico), once governor of
Chihuahua—at the same time ambas
sador to this country, later special
ambassador to a joint conference on
the Venezuelan controversy, and fin
ally minister of foreign affairs, dean
of the Mexican cabinet during the
last days of Diaz, a man known
throughout Europe as perhaps the
best authority on the Mexican affairs,
once a rich man and an honest one
too, the best friend Mexico had, had
done more to develop Mexico perhaps
than any one man, now a fugitive
from his own country where he •tfas
born, has only this to say of Mr. Wil
son: In his letter to me of recent
date, written from Los Angeles, Cal.,
he says:
"President Wilson would certainly
be a very unhappy man, if he knew
that his blunders in his Mexican pol
icy have cost Mexico 300,000 lives and
the destruction of over one billion
dollars worth of personal property."
In conclusion if I had been Presi
dent Wilson I would have had South
America join with me in restoring or
der with a guarantee of Mexican in
tegrity, or .if more inclined Ijis way,
would have kept out of Vera Cruz,
out of northern Mexico with General
Pershing's army and also kept the
Mexicans out of the United States
force exerted entirely outside of Mex
ico. H. M. CREEL.

ATTITUDE OF ADMINISTRATION
IN REGARD TO MEXICO AND
THE EUROPEAN WAR ATTACK­
ED BY CANDIDATE IN AN-AD
DRESS AT DETROIT, MICH.
Detroit, Mich., Aug. 7.—Charles E.
Hughes in his' first speech of his
transcontinental trip tonight assailed
the administration vigorously for its
foreign poilcy, its Mexican policy, for
appointing men whom he termed in
experienced to diplomatic posts, an!
for what he characterized as "a raid
upon the civil service of the United
States."
"He kept us out of war," Mr.
Hughes said, referring to the presi
dent, and a democratic campaign slo
gan. "Yet he seized Vera Crue. That
was war—very ignoble war—and it
was called war over the bodies of
those dead soldiers it. was called
war of service.
No Particular Policy.
"Talk about what is your policy.
What is the president's policy—docs
anyone know? Has the executive ever
had a. policy for more than six months
on the Mexican question? I repeat,
who knows today what the policy of
the administration will be thrc*
months hence? My friends, the trou
ble is that this administration has bit
ten such a record that no matter what
it says, you do not know whether it
will stick to it.
Will Force Respect.
"We have had an exhibition during
the past three years which I confess
filled me with a deep sense of shame.
I have not a particle of militaristic
spirit in my system, but if I am elect
ed president I will see to it that Amer
ican rights in Mexico are respected."
Mr. Hughes assailed the adminis
tration course toward upholding Am
erican, rights abroad duripg the Euro
pean war.
No Protection.
"When I say I am an American cit
zen," said the nominee,"I ought to
say the proudest thing that any man
can say in this world. But you can't
have that pride if American citizenry
is a cheap thing, if it is not worthy
of protection this wide world over.
There is no man who could success

munity the platform that an American
citizen's rights stop at the coast line

chooses to take it."
The nominee cited the republican
platform declaration that 30,000 gov
ernment positions have been taken
from the operation of the civil service
law during the present administration,
and declared that "that sort of thing
has got to stop."
