MORE SHEEP KILLED.
Worthless dogs raided the flock of
Southdown sheep of Judge A. D. Ford.s

this county will be a thing of the pas'
We understand that 250 dogs were ex

WILSON DECLINES
Invitation To Speak Al Winchester.
In his formal reply declining the in
vitation of Chairman Cantrill and Ken
tucky Democrats to open the State
campaign at Winchester, President
Wilson explains the reason for his in
ability to accede to their wishes aa
follow:
'My Dear Mr. Cantrill I wish with
all my heart that I could accept the
attractive invitation to speak at Win
Chester on September 5, but I "feel that
I can hardly do it at that time. On
the 4th I am to speak at Lincoln's birth
place and that makes my errand to
Kentucky so distinctly a non-partisan
errand that I should like to go and
come without disturbing for myself or
for the other who will participate in
the exercises at the birthplace the in,
spiration of Lincoln's example of (lis
interested service meant for the whole
people without regard to party.
"I need not tell you that my whole
heart is in the campaign, for I sincere
ly believe that the Democratic party is
the real party of the people, the party
which In the present circumstances Lin
coin nimseii would have wished to see
conduct the affairs of the nation, but I
would rather not make this particular
errand to Kentucky a political errand
and I am sure that my friends In Keu-
tuckv will appreciate the ressons which
control me in this case.
"Cordially and sincerely yours.
"WOODKOW WILSON."
LIGHTING FRANCHISE FOR
THE CITY BEFORE
THECOUNCIL
A city ordinance directing the sale of
an Electric Light Franchise in the city
of Lancaster was placed upon its first
reading before the council last Monday
night. This ordinance has been pre
pared by the city attorney, J. E. Hob
Inson, with a great deal of care and
guards the peoples interest against ex
orbitant charges by the purchaser,
while providing for n twenty-four hour
service.
The rates under the new system will
be very much lower than Is now In
effect in the city. Among the provis
ions more beneficial than now enjoyed
by the people, will be lower rates, bet
ter lights, twenty-four hours for resi
dence lighting, all night for street with
more and better lights and the pump
ing of the city water by electricity at a
saving of several hundred dollars per
annum over the present cost of pump
ing. There is also a provision in the
ordinance giving the city the privilege
of taking over the plant upon reason
able terms after the expiration of sev
en year if the electricity should be
able to be produced at a lower rate at
that time.
It is understood that there are a num
ber of local people who are anxious to

This morning, at five o'clock,
the awakening life of a new day,
M. Dawson Hughes fell asleep.
It was just as the birds carolled the
coming of the morning and just as the
rosy fingers of tho orb of day tinted
the eastern sky with a sheen of glory,
he exchanged the earthly joys for the
fuller and more complete joy of heav
en and fell asleep like a tired child.
Mr. Hughes was born Nov. 23, 1845,
in Lincoln county, being a son of Mr.
Joseph Hughes and Amelia Hussell.
He was married Feb. 9, 18C9, to Miss
Martha Elkln, she died Sept. 1914, and

though Mr. Hughes was not In the best
of health at that time he has failed
rapidly since then, as he often told his
friends there v.'as not a day he did not
miss her and long to join her.
In his death Garrard has lost one of
her best citizens. He was a leader In
every movement to upbuild the com
munity and known throughout the
county for his probity and dependable
sterling worth. By nature kind and
charitable, he cultivated and practiced
the greatest of virtues and spread the
mantle of charity over the faults of his
fellows. It was known and always
said of him that if he could not speak
well of anyone he maintained a golden
silence. A kind and loving husband, a
noble father, a true friend, an exem
plary citizen, hi filled well every duty
of life. He had been a member of the
Christian church since his early youth.
having first united with that denomina
tion at Hush Branch. In his last year
his church and his religion meant every
thing to him.
Mr. Hughe was a man of splendid
literary attainments. Reading was al
ways a source of delight to him, ac
cordingly he was one of the most widely
read men of pure literature in Lancaster.
It la remarkable that he maintained his
intellectual virility almost to the end,
"Yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking
star
Beyond the utmost bound of human
thought."
At one time he was editor of this
paper, in his last years he has been in
the real estate business, but in every
walk of life he has sought to upbuild
Lancaster and worked for her interest.
Mr. Hughes is survived by one sister,
Miss Mary Hughes, of Louisville, and
three children, Mr. It. E. Hughes of
Louisville, Mr. Saufley Hughes and
Mrs. May Hughes Noland of this place.
He is also survived by four grand-children,
Hubert and Nellie Noland, Mar

BUSINESS MEN'S RATING
ASSOCIATION ORGANIZED
Business Houses Of Entire Stale Cc
Operate To Put Check On Dead
Beats Who Want Credit.
A representative of a great business
men's protective association, of Culum
bus, Ohio, wis in Lancaster this week
in the interest of the Kentucky Blue
Book of dead beats, which will be is
sued to all members of the association
in a few weeks.
This association is accompliihing for
the retail business men of thi and
other states, what Bradstreet and Dunn
are doing for the wholesalers.
Many Lancaster business men have
joined the association, which also oper
ates a collection agency and employs
all honorable means to collect accounts
against debtors, and falling to do so
they are quoted in the Blue Book juit
as their standing will warrant, and all
members of the association are supplied
with a copy of the book. To have one'
name appear in this book is indeed
calamity, as their credit la killed, not
only In their home town but In the en
tire state.
But it is a good thing for the mer
chant who can thus keep a close tab on
those who are not entitled to credit.
With this class of debtors it Is nccer
sary for them to pay up their old ac
counts before they can get credit from
any member of the association.
The Central Hecord has joined this
asaociation, and will in a few day be
compelled to liat a lot of old account
for collection and rating.

At any and all seasons you will find us doing our
best to deserve your patronage.
We know of no better way of deserving it than by
running the best sort of a grocery that we know how.
That means never relaxing our watchfulness of this,
that and the other thing. It means being satisfied with
modest profits.
It means many other things too-but chiefly it
means GROCERY GOODNESS.
Today is a gocd time to put us to the test and the
article may be whatever you happen to need.
