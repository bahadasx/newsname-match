Conservative estimates of the loss of
life In the Cabin Creek, Paint Creek

Wild rumors of 150 to 200 dead
are not borne out by latest reports.

The number of homes, carried from

Success of Italians and Czar's Troops
May Decide Roumanla

War.
[By Bd L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, Aug. 10.—Russian troops
under General Letch ltzky, were ap
proaching the Blstrltza river, only
three miles east of the Galician city
of Stanislau, yesterday morning, ac
cording to dispatches from Petrograd
today.
The Austro-Germans were expected
to mafce a final stand on the west
bank of the Bistritza. If they are
driven from these positions by the ad
vancing Slavs, the fall of Stanislau
and an AustroGerman retirement
northward to the Dniester is consid
ered certain. It is barely possible
that Stanislau already has been cap
tured by the troops of the czar, offi
cials believe.
If Stanislau does fall to the Rus
sians, the retreating right wing of
General Von Bothmer*s army is ex
pected to take up positions behind the
strongly fortified Dniester river
bridgehead north of Halitz. At this
position the decisive battle for Lem
berg may be fought.
Delayed dispatches from Bucharest
today reported that the Roumanian
war party, favoring action on the side
of the allies, has been stirred to great
action by Russia's unexpected stroke
in southeastern Galicla and the sur
prising victory of the Italians on the
Isonzo. Pro-ally demonstrations fol
lowed news of the Russian success
against the Austro43ermans and the
early Italian gains on the Isonzo.
News of the fall of Goritz had not
reached Bucharest when the dis
patches were filed.
Alleged acts of aggression by Bul
garian soldiers along the Roumanian
frontier have heightened the ill-feel
ing against the central powers. The
situation became so tense that a spe
cial cabinet meeting was held this
A dispatch from Amsterdam today
asserted Germany again is uneasy ov
er the Balkan situation, though satis
fied that Roumanla will take no Im
mediate action. The chief concern In
Berlin is that the allies will begin a
great offensive from Salonika while
the Russians are closing In upon Lem
berg and the Italians driving south
ward toward Trieste, convincing tho
Roumanians that the hour has come
to join and Invade Hungary.
Still Advancing.
PETTROGRAD, Aug. 10.—The rail
way station of Chryplln, only three
miles east of Stanislau has been cap

It was officially announced today.
Chryplln is a railway station on the
right bank of the river Bistritza.

VETOES MOINES, Iowa, Aug. 10.—J.
P. Morgan, who doubled his father's

the Iowa farmers whose corn crop
this year will be worth 152,320,000
mor^ this year than last, according
to tHe estimate of experts based on

Tnis means at least 200,000 autos

as against a paltry 175,000 this year,
only one to every thirteen people. It
means electric light systems for pros
perous Iowa farmers and electric
washers and flat irons for the farm

and bath rooms and* trips to Califor

Hot winds and rust have injured
the wheat crop in the norih and corn
in southern states has suffered, but
Iowa with 303,000,000 bushels of corn
last year has in prospect 365,000,000
bushels this year and the selling
price now is 73 cents as against 71
in 1915.
Wheat and oats show a falling off,
but the advance in price promises to
make up for It and cattle and hogs
with high priced corn are expected
to advance.

UNITED PB1ES6 SERVICE
Reduction In Cable Ratee and News
paper Connection, Will Re
sult In Much
Good.
[By Charles P. Stewart, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BUENOS AJLREJS, Aug. 10.—Worth
and South America have been drawn
measurably closer together by tho
reduction in postal and cable rates
and the signing of contracts by the
United Press and the influential
newspaper La Nacion for the first
comprehensive news service between
tho two continents. Dr. Jose Luis
"iurature, foreign minister of Argen
tine, and foremost journalist, declared
today.
Not only have the two continents
been linked up more closely as
geographical unite, Dr. 'Murature
pointed out, but their peoples will be
brought Into closer sympathy.
"A giant stride by North and South
America toward, Pan-Americanism,"
was the comment' made by the Argen
tine foreign minister on this triple
accomplishment of the last few days.
"It Is a matter not merely of exped
iency, tout based on historical and
geographical actualties.
"The date on whicih this collective
action will be mobilized in the serv
ice of common ideals and Interests
will be determined by the speed with
which the masses grasp the reasons
and advantages, which are insepar
able from Pan-American functioning.
"No development will so quickly
promote a genuine sympathetic un
derstanding as the Interchange of
news through such a medium as the
United Press."
Dr. Murature expressed the belief
that the exchange of news between
the United Press and La Nacion in
particular will promote among the
masses of South America a more
undenUKU., .t t*. wl"J»
action of the United States toward
Mexico than exists now anywhere ex
cept in government circles.
"I personally consider that the
United States Is offering most posi
tive evidence that its Mexican policy
Is shaped by Pan-American ideals,"
said the foreign minister. "The high
est respect constantly shown the
Sovereignty of Mexico and the con
sideration demonstrated for her in
dependence, is evidence of the sin
cerity of the American purpose."
Business and government circles
are most keenly interested both in
the cable and postal rate reduction
and in the arrangement for Inter
change of news. Several prominent
business men pointed out that such
an exchange of news between the
two continents as is provided by the
United Press-lA Nacion contract, is
of necessity the first step in drawing
North and South America into closer
relations.

Governor Hughes Speaks To
day in North Dakota at
Fargo and Grand
Forks.
ALLIANCE IS POWERFUL
Farmers Nob Partisan League Is
Strong Enough to Carry State
For Any of Ita
Favorites
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
FARGO, N. D., Aug. 10^-Charles
Evans Hughes set out today to cap
ture the farmer vote. The republi
can nominee got his flArt glimpse of
the hickory shirt and the gaUus aa a
presidential candidate today. Fargo
gave him a royal welcome. Farmers
from everywhere about came In their
autos to hear the former justice of
the suprenie court of the U. 8, ex
pound his doctrines of republicanism.
Particular interest centered In
Hughes' appearance In North Dakota
today because of the suspicion of
politicians that the G. O. P. candidate
Is setting out deliberately to kidnap
North Dakota's famous Farmers Non
partisan league.
Up in the northwest, the Farmers'
Aliance represents a new thing In
politics. According to ex-Representa
tive James Manahan who stumped
North Dakota recently for the league
just before It carried the nomination
of practically all its candidates in
both old parties at the primaries,
the league will again be successful in
the fall elections so far. as the state
ticket is concerned and will eject pro-'
fessional politilcians from control.
Then, according to Manahan, they
will enact laws for state owned ele
vators, revision of the tax laws,
mutual insurance against hall and
other progressive plans.
Sponsors for Hughes are hoping
that the republican candidate wllP
carry such a convincing message to
the farmers In North Dakota today
and tomorrow that being already well
organized, they will swing that
strength to the G. O. P. With such a
swing they count on further farmer
strength from other states.
Hughes has a busy program today
and tomorrow. Only two set speeches
were scheduled for today—at Fargo
and Grand Forks—but it was expect
ed that the candidate would find. op
portunity for several rear platform
talks. The governor's voice was im
proved today and there was little
hoarseness, although he plainly show
ed the strain of the past few days
campaigning. Despite the hot weath
er the candidate still stuck manfully
to his "boiled" shirt, stand-up winged
colar and white vest—but In all of
his talks the shirt, collar and vest
wilted away In short order. Mrs.
Hughes wore her "number two" hat
a simple narrow white brimmed
affair. She has worn number one—a
dark one—quite plain—just once
since leaving Bridgehampton and
that was at Niagara Falls.
Women are For Hughes.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Ctlo., Aug.

ltOIMBl Aug. 10/—The Atastrtan avia
tion station of Alsovlzza, six miles
east of Goritz, has been captured by'
Italian troope who are continuing pur-'.
suit of the Austrian force that re
treated from Goritz, according to re
ports received here today.
Cavalry detachments end bersag
llerl cyclist detachments entered Also
vizza after putting to flight tho Aus
trian rear guard which attempted to
make a stand In the eastern suburbs
of Goritz. in this section a body of
Austrian troops is reported to have
been cut off from the main force.
Pursuit of the Austrian army has
•been somewhat hampered by the
necessity of repairing damaged
bridges and roadways destroyed by
the enemy before the retreat from
Goritz. Infantry detachments, how
ever .are in close contact with the
Austrian right wing, striking un
ceasing blows and attempting to cut
off and surround bodies of Austrian
troops moving southward toward tho
Carso plateau.
Large numbers of heavy guns,
some which the enemy had made in
effectual attempts to destroy, fell In- -,
to the hands of General Cadorna's
forces at Goritz.
King Victor Emanuel is trader
stood to have been at the Isonzo
front when Goritz fell, though he has
not yet entered the Austrian strong*
hold.
Great street demonstrations oo
curred In.'Rome last night, when tho
capture of Goritz "was announced.
Crowds marched through the streets
singing the Italian and allied an
thems and cheering the king, thek«t,
Italian commanders and the army.
The public accepts the capture of
Goritz as only the beginning of a.
great move southward which they bfr
lleve will culminate in the taking ot
Trieste. It is believed here that thaj
whole Austrlan-Isonzo front from.
Tolmlno southward, eventually will
be broken.
Correspondents report that tha
capture of one of the heights sur
rounding Goritz was effected by a
daring enterprise. The Italians dug
along under ground tunnels to the
Austrians' stronghold. At a given
signal several thousand Italians sud
denly swarmed from these tunnels
and fell upon the Austrians, who
were taken completely by surprise.
A total of 21,750 prisoners have been
taken on the Goritz front, according
to dispatches from army headquarters
today. The guns and other booty have
not yet been counted.
A remarkable scene greeted the
Italian troops when they entered the
