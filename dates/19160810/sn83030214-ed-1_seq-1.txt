Business is good with some of the

and they are sad only when they think
of the days when the men will come

A woman who has the sad-faccd,

has given up two sons to her coun?

FORD GARAGES,
NEW AUTO PLAN
Company's 51 Branches To
Be Elirninated to Save
Car Owners Money.
Having just madde another redue?
tion in the rrice of its cars, the Ford
Motor Company, it was lc-arned yester?
day, plans to make it even more incx
pensive to own a Ford by making a
i radical change in its sales system.
The innovation will permit Ford
1 owners to have garagc and repair ser
! vice at considerably lower rates than
prevail at pre.ent. The purpose is U
avoid the complaint that, while one
may buy a Ford at a price unusually
low, the upkeep is f*r*qaeatly nearly
ns high as that for th* fltorag* of c
high priced automohile.
The plan, as understood by Ford rep
I rea*atativ?fl in New York, is to abol
iah the branches now maintained in
ind turn their busincis
over to a larg" number of dealers with
garage and npair facilities. I'urcha
" Ford cars by this arrangemetit
will be able to keep their cars in the
Ford garages at particularly low rate .
Officials of the comj.any are said to
have decided it would be impracticable
for the company to maintain garagfll
: and service station.*, although they
agreed such service for the benerit of
Ford owners would be of immense ad
vantage. lt was ther. that tha plan to
tui ii this function over to individua1
dealeri was formulated.

West Virginia Governor
Calls National Guard
to Aid Victims.
Huntington, W. Va., Aug. 0. At
least 150 persons were drowned, 5,000

000 damage was done in floods that fol?
lowed a cloudburst in the Coal River
and Cabin Creek districts to-day, ac?
cording to reports reaching here t*>
night.
Governor Hatfield received official
word of the flood soon after he reached
Huntington to-night. He at once got
into telephone communication with
Camp Kanawha, where the 2d Regi?
ment is encamped, and instructed Ad
jutant General John C. Band to gather
all available foodstufTs, teatfl and
clothing in ( harleston and place them
on a t-pccial train to be run to the
flooded districts without delay.
The Governor was informed in an
appeal from Cabin Creek that the lOM
of life would exceed a hundred and
that more than 5,000 are homelces.
So serious did the Governor con
sider the situation that he announced
to-night he would be unable to attend
the .state convention here and that he
would leave immediately for Cabin
Creek.
Officials of the Virginia Power Com?
pany said to-night that at least 150
persons have lost their lives. Fleven
bodies have so far been recovered.
Many persons have been seen clinging
to debris in ihe flood, but no assistance
eould be given them.

R.R.TROUBLES
ARE TAKEN UP
BY MEDIATORS
4 Great Brotherhoods
Accept Federal Com
mission's Offices.
UNIONS PRESENT
SIDE TO-DAY
Road Managers Take in?
itiative Toward Settling
Nation-wide Dispute.
The menace of a general railroad
strike loomed less darkly yesterday
The four great railway brotherhoods,
representing the 400,000 discontentod
trainmen, accepted the officei of thc
Federal Mediation Commission and the
hope that the strike may be averted
made progress, though with some diffi
culty. Wall Street took heart, and
stocks, apathetic of late, made gaina.
The railroad managera took the in
itative. At the behest of a conference
committee of nineteen of their number,
the I'nited States Board of Mediation
and Conciliation approached represen
tatives of the employes. While the
union leaders were not quick about ac
cepting the mediators' offer. they did
accept. This, observers point out, is
the main thing.
Move Made "Through Courteey."
"Through courtesy" is the way the
brotherhood officials explain their se
I tion. This move makes the situation
analacou* to the recent street railway
atrike, which was luccesafully medi
ated by Mayor Mitchel and Oscar S.
Straus. The Federal board will have
no specified powers other than those of
persuasion. Neither had Mitchel or
Straus, but, as followers of the litus
tion point out, they found a way. And
if the Federal board cannot find one it
may improvise one.
And at any rate and observers lay
stress on this the matter is brought a
step closer to the White House. Mem?
bers of the mediation body are under?
stood to be in New York at the sugges?
tion of President Wilson.
On Tuesday the brotherhoods in
formed the railway committee that 94
per cent of thesr 400,000 members had
voted to striL* if their demands for
an e ght-hour day and day and a half
pay for overtime were not met, and
that an answer was expected within
j twenty-four hours.
In behalf ol the railroads Mr. Lee
: asked until 10 a. m. yesterday to re?
ply. When that nour came he in
' formed the repr*sentative* of the "big
j four" unions, ussenbled at the Kngi
I neering Societie* Building, that it wa*
! impossible to grant the concessions. Hfl
1 urged that the matter be put into the
! hands of the federal mediators. U?
I also asked the brotherhoods to join
with the railways in thii requeit, but
his proposed was refused by A. H. UST*
retson. chairman of the union confer?
ence committee. The aetion of their
chief in refuaing tO take B step tow?
ard mediation greatly pleased th
union men.
Hoth I.eadera Anxious.
The situation wa? tense while thc
leaders of both sides sought to har
monne the situation, Mr. Lee plead
,ng for mediation and Mr darretson.
quutlv but reeolately anlaiaiaf tha
the pfoblem eould not well be solvel
by the agency of a third party.
It was apparent at the close of the
meeting that if the good offices of the
Federal mediators were to be used the
reauest would Brat have to come from
the operators. Although preferring to
settle their difficulties without outside
assistance, the brotherhood represenU
tives let it be known later that as a
"matter of courtesy" they would not
reieet an mvitation from the redera
mediators, although they had declmed
to sign the railroad managers letter to
i the board. . ,.
Before the day was half gone it was
obvious that nearly every one con
'ctrned in tho great railway labor prob
l lem was leaning toward mediation. The
I bcard consisting of Commissioner
William L. Chamben, Aaaist.nt Com
m.s.ioner G. W. W. Hanger and Chair?

Defeat of Foe.
[By Cable to The Tribune.]
London, Aug. 9.?Gorizia, the key to Trieste, has fallen to
the Italians. After three days of furious battling, Cadorna's men
have entered the fortress town on the Isonzo and set the seal on
Italy's magnificent offensive. Their bag of prisoners already
contains more than 10,000 troops.
The quick vietory is a sure sign that the concerted Allied
offensive has begun to tell. While the Allies in Picardy are
slowly pressing forward and the Russians are seoring swifter
and more substantial gains in Galicia, the Italians are smashing
through the whole Isonzo line.
That front has been weakened by the withdrawal of Teuton
reserves to reinforce other lines menaced by the Allies' batter
ing. The German General Staff apparently has not enough men
to withstand three offensives. Only one course seems left to the
Teuton?to shorten his line.

The victory was due to the effec?
