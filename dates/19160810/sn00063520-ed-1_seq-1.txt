WARM SPRINGS
DISTRICT ON THE 15-TH
the market for the bonds after the
election next Tuesday.
In viw of the fact that for the first
time In recent years the bond mar
ket has become active and moeny Is
seeking investment, the report of Mr.
Hopson will be of material assist
ance In the sale of the bonds. In
fact those Interested feel that his
report assures the sale.
A. W 'I'm, of this city, with
whom Mr liopson spent a portion
ol Tuesday going owr various phases
of the project declares that the con-1
summation of the sale of the bonds
und Hie completion of the reservoir
and laterals, means more to Ontario,
Vale and lenity than uny event iu
recent years.
According to the plana of the pro-1
Jectors one-half of the sum realized
from the bund sale will be spent for
the reservoir while the balance will ,
be used to enlarge the present later- j
als, where needed, and to extend
others to the lands now without wat
er rights.
To complete the work will require
some time. If an Immediate sale
of the bonds can be made, and tin
work started this fall, sufficient work
cau be done to put water on all the
lands In 1918 The cost for this per
acre will depend upon the ditches at
present reaching the various portions '
of the district

He declared that It waa no more
possible to expect tariff protection

The nominee assailed the admin

he would appoint to office only men

The nominee said he stood for a

"I do not want any hot air In

The democratic party, Hughes
said, was approaching the Idea of a
protective tariff "like a skittish
horse to a brass band " In 1912, he
added, "the democratic platform

tariff waa unconstitutional.
