Protection for American interests,
adequate military and naval prepar

rights abroad, and an efficient, busi

demanded by Charlen E. Hughes in
his address at the auditorium this
morning.
He pledged himself to the support
of these policies if elected to the
presidency by the voters of this na
tion.
Mr. Hughes spoke for some 20
minutes, and was frequently inter
rupted by applause.
His complete address follows:
"Governor Fraser, ladies and gen
tlemen, or, as I prefer to say,, fellow
citizens: (Applause). It is a very
great pleasure to come to the state of
North Dakota and to be welcomed
here so cordially on your behalf by
that fine upstanding representative of
North Dakota, Mr. Fraser (applause).
"I wish I could tell you how it
thrills a man to make a trip of the
sort I am making. I have been sev
eral times across the continent and I
know something of the various com
munities composing our country but
to go through in this rapid way, re
ceiving their geherous welcomes,
makes an appeal to the heart of a
man, and fills him with a burning
desire to serve the people of the Uni
ted States (applause.)
"I come to this, .great agricultural
state fresh froip communities where
industrial Interests are paramount
There is constantly, borne in upon me
the thought of the unity of American
life, despite the diversity of its re
sources-and its interests. We are all
linked together In a common destiny.
We know the vast importance of the
upbuilding of the industries of the
country. We also know that at the
base of all of our prosperity is the
agricultural interests of the country.
We know you cannot build up one
Industry toil! promote the prosperity
of farmers,. and we know if we
neglect the just interests of agricul
ture, Industry will wither, and the
prosperity of our -great- cities will ab
solutely fail (applause).
Democratic Unity.
"I am filled with the consciousness
of this interrelation .of our life, and
on our sense of democratic unity
which will defy all divisions, which
will make impossible any divided al
legiance, which will secure firm and
strong the foundations of our prog
ress. I want also to have it recog
nized that our economic unity is a
great fact of our American life, and
we should all feel—north, south, east
and west that- we are in a great co
operative undertaking. And the men
in New Tork must realize they are
the brothers of the men of North Da.
kota, and the men of North Dakota
mUst realize they are the brethren
of the men in New York, and we will
all go up or go down together and
that throughout the length and
breadth of the land must be this de
termined co-operation, that every
where we shall have the best done, to
the end that we shall enjoy a com
mon prosperity.
Protective Policy.
"Now, I stand for certain things. I
stand for the principle of protection
of American interests (applause). It
is hardly necessary to enlarge upon
that principle at this time. We have
before us a great drama of a world
contest, the final ending of which
will present to us a crisis in our eco
nomic life. Our opponents have long
stated that they were opposed to a
tariff for the purpose of protection.
I believe in a protective tariff (ap
plause). I believe in protection with
out abuse I think that is perfectly
possible. I believe in collating the
facts of our life, in understanding
actual conditions, and then in so ad
justing our duties that we may secure
economic independence. Our oppo
nents, who for generations have told
us that It- was contrary to the consti
tution of the United 8tates to have
duties except for the purpose of rev
enue, are now telling us that there is
an economic revolution and perhaps
now we can have a duty on dye stuffs
and a 'non-partisan commission. I
believe in .trusting .those, who really
accept the doctrine of protection to
the interests of American life, with
the enforcement of that doctrine and
its application in' concrete legislation
(applause). I believe in protection
for the farmers Just as I believe in
protection for the men in the factor
ies (applause.)
New Viewpoint.
"We must have in this country more
of a scientific point of view than we
have hitherto had. We have had a
country lavish in Its natural wealth,
a benediction to the people who are
fortunate to Uve in it. We are get
ting to the time when we must count

Villages and Mining Dis

Charleston, W. Va., Aug. 10.—Res
cue parties worked desperately today
in an effort to make their way up the
Cabin Creek and Coal River Valleys,
which for 20 miles southward from
the Kanawha river were devastated
yesterday by a cloudburst, which left
in its wake a death toll estimated
over 100 persons and a property loss
of at least $2,000,000.
Because of the topography of the
country, state authorities today ex
pressed the belief that it will be sev
eral days before the full extent of
the flood will be ascertained.
Eight villages and mining settle
ments in the district either were total
ly or partly destroyed, while many
others felt the effects of the storm
more or less. Those practically de
stroyed or badly damaged, according
to the latest reports received here
from rescue parties, are:
Acme, Ronda, Dry Branch, Miami,
Sharon, Dawes, Kayford and Eskdale.
It is reported that 60 persons were
drowned between Acme and Kayford.
Persons Find Homes Gone.
Persons driven from their homes
to the mountains are returning to find
whole villages and mining cabins
swept away, while distress and suffer
ing are seen on every hand.
Two companies of the Second West
Virginia infantry were taken to Cabin
Creek Junction for relief work. They
carried provisions and tents, and a
special train was made up here to go
as far as the hastily repaired tracks
will permit, with provisions.
Reports today from United States
Commissioner Howard Smith, who
led a relief "party from a mimWer of
mining companies, that loQtlng*.)ias
commenced and a number of arrests
were made, and some property recov
ered.
23 Bodies Found.
Twenty-three bodies were recovered
up to noon today from the debris car
ried down from the flood in the Cabin
Creek valley. Reports still indicate
that the life loss is heavy, but accur-

Locate Marooned Train.
An excursion train, carrying 410
persons, marooned by the flood, was
located today between the Main Horse
creek and Little Horse creek, with
washouts on both sides. Relief was
sent from St. Albins. Women and chil
dren constitute the majority of the
excursionists.
This afternoon the estimate of the
dead remained at
100.
