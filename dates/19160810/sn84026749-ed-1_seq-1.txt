RISE IN WHEAT
SENDS FLOUR
Household Necessity Advanced
50 Cents a Barrel Foroes
Bread Cost Up.
CHICAGO PIT A "MADHOUSE"
Everyone Anxious to Buy Ex
cept Few Profit Takers,
Who Won Overnight.
CHICAGO, Aug. 10. Advanc
tog wheat prices hit the American
housewife today.
Flour was advanced 50 cents a
barrel on the Chicago wholesale
markets, and the housewife who
buys a "big sack" will pay 10 to
15 cents more for it than she did
yesterday.
Flour today sold for $7.25 a
barrel for the baker's grade. Yes
terday it sold at $6.75.
In the last month flour has ad
vanced $2 a barrel, and the bak
ers already are considering
abandonment of the time-honored
5-cent loaf and sale of only a 10
cent loaf, slightly smaller than the
present "dime" loaf.
TRADERS VERY EXCITED.
While the flour market wu advanc
ing today wheat price alternately
rote and (ell amid excited buying and
selling.
Scenes In the wheat pit were like
thoae of the daya when big- traders
ought to -corner the whole world'
wheat supply. Everyone wai trying
to tav except those conservative ons
who rold today at prices 10 to 15 centa
higher than they bought It at.
Just when things had quieted down
to an ordinary din of trading: some
body broke Into the pit with a rumor
that the United States Government
had planned an embargo on shipments
of wheat because the crops were so
small.
This started things again. The mar
ket soared for a minute. Then some
one else had another flock of rumors
and prices dropped. It was see-saw
up and down throughout the morning.
Brokers in close touch with conditions,
discounted rumors that two-dollar
wheat was In sight. They said It would
stick somewhere around a dollar and
a half a bushel, until something, no
body knows what, throws another bomb
Into the market.
Stone Denounces
Treaty Publication
S3ys Extracts From Pact With
Denmark Was "Obtained by
Dishonorable Means."
Chairman Stone of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, today denounced
on the floor the "obtaining by dishon
orable means" and the publication this
morning of extracts from the treaty for
tho purchase of the Danish West In
dies. He declared he would ask an execu
tive session of the Senate this evening
to consider the situation.
He strongly Intimated the text had
been stolen from the executive flies of
the Senate. If It should prove, how
ever, he said, that any Senator had
given out the Information, he should
be "scorned and disciplined by the
Senate." '
"The offense" he said, "Is the more
eerlous because the D&nlsh govern
ment has requested that the terms of
the treaty be kept secret until ratified."
Though agreeing that the theft of the
treaty, if it had been stolen, was dis
honorable, Senator Borah declared vig
orously for the discussion of treaties In
open Instead of closed sessions.
NO SECRET LUSITANIA
NOTE, SAYS LANSING
Denying flatly the existence of any
.unpublished note from Germany regard.
lug a settlement of the Lusltanla con
trcverwy, the State Department again
today characterized as unfounded
printed reports that a stetlement has
been effected, and that the Administra
tion has asked permission of Germany
to make public the last chapters of me
correspondence.
Secretary of State Lansing, who re
turned today from his vacation, let It
be known that there la no such note
from Germany In existence. He gave It
U- be understood that no definite settle
ment has beer, reached, and explained
that tho Informal convisHtlsns held
botween him and Count von Bernetorff
last winter and spring have never boo
rjductd to formal writlnu.
The Impression In many official
quarters. Is that the reports are being
circulated deliberately by persons
close to the German embassy, with a
lew to making It appear that a thor.
oughly satisfactory understanding has

PRICESSOARING
Conferees Disagree On
Chief Navy Bill Points
Disagreement on every important
feature of the navy bill will be
reported by the conferee to
both houses tomorrow, House
Chairman Padgett announced
today. The House managers
flatly refused to meet the In
creases proposed by the Senate
in the building program and
. personnel.
A fight will be made, backed by
the Administration, to have the
House override its conferees
and agree to the Senate provi
sions. It appeared this afternoon that
the proposed equipment of the
Puget Sound navy yard for
battleship construction is in
danger of being strickon out of
the naval bill. It is one of the
many things on which the Sen
ate and House conferees find
themselves almoBt hopelessly
divided.
The House conforees object to
the appropriations for Boston,
Norfolk and Philadelphia yards.

The Austro-Germans were expected
to make a final stand on the west bank
of the Blatritra.
If they are driven from these positions
by the advancing 3lae the fall of
Btanlslau and an Austro-German re
tirement northward to the Dniester is
considered certain.
It Is barely possible that Stanislau
already has been captured by the troops
of the Tzar, officials believe.

ONE DETACHMENT CUT OFF
Victorious Troops' Advance
Hampered By Roadways
and Bridges Destroyed.
ROME, Aug. 10. The Austrian
aviation station o Aisovizza, six
miles east of Goritz, has been
captured by Italian troops, who
are continuing the pursuit of the
Austrian force that" retreated from
Goritz, according to reports re
ceived here today.
Cavalry detachments and Ber-
saglieri cyclist detachments enter
ed Aisovizza after putting to flight
the Austrian rear guard, which at
tempted to make a stand in the
eastern suburbs of Goritz.
In this action a body of Aus
trian troops is reported to have
been cut off from the main force.
Pursuit of the Austrian army
has been pmewhat hampered by
the necessity of repairing dam
aged bridges and roadways de
stroyed by the enemy before the
retreat from Goritz.
UNCEASING BLOWS.
Infantry detachments, however, are
In close contact with the Austrian right
wing, striking unceasing blows and at
tempting to cut off and surround bodies
of Austrian troops moving southward
toward the Carso plateau.
Large umbers of heavy guns, some
of which the enemy had made inef
fectual attempts to destroy, fell into
the hands of General Cadorna'a forces
at Goritz.
King Victor Kmanucl is understood
to have beer, at the Isonzo front when
Gorltt fell, though he has not yet en
tered the Austrian stronghold.
Great etreot demonstrations occurred
In Rome last nlu-ht when tho capture of
Gorltr. was announced. Ciowds marched
tnrougn tne strretH. singing the Italian
and ullled anthems and cheering the
King, the Italian commanders, and the
army.
Tne public accepts trie capture of
Goritz as only tho beginning of a great
move southward, which they believe
will culminate In the taking of Trieste.
It Is believed here that tho whole Aus-trlan-Isonzo,
from Tolmlno southward,
eventually wlU be broken.
Correspondents report that the cap
ture of one of the heights surrounding
Gnrlts was effected by a daring enter
prise. i ne Italians dug long underground
tunnels to the Austrian lines. After a
heavy bombardment several hundred
Italians suddenly swarmed from tho
mouths of these tunnels and fell upon
the Austrlans, who were taken com
pletely by surprise.
21,750 Prisoners Taken.
A total of 21,750 prisoners have been
taken on the Goritz front, according to
dispatches from army headquarters to
day. The guns and other booty have
not yet been counted.
A remarkable scene greeted the
Italian troops when they entered the
city of Goritz. Several thousand Italian
residents, who for weeks had lived un
derground, rushed out, bringing flowers
and Italian flags from concealed places,
and cheqred the conquerors. In other
underground caverns several thousand
Austrian soldiers were found and made
prisoners.
A war office review of the Isonco
offensive made public today corroborates
earlier press dispatches. The war of
fice recited the beginning of the violent
bombardment and told how Italian In
fantry opened the attack Sunday after
noon, capturing first Monte Sabotlno
and the Goritz bridgehead and later
Monte San Mlchcle, south of Goritz.
The Austrlans counter-attacked with
the greatest violence, but wero beaten
back each time with severe losses.
