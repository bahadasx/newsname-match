of exceptional ability who would fill
the office with honor to himself and
satisfaction to his constituents. It will
be impossible for Mr. Duff to person

MORE MEN THAN WOMEN
HAVE APPENDICITIS
Surgeons state men are slightly more
subject to appendicitis than women.
Vale people should know that a few
doses of simple buckthorn bark, gly
cerine, as mixed in Adler-1 ka, often
relieve or prevent appendicitis. This
mixture removes such surprising foul
matter that ONE SPOONFUL relieves
almost AN V CASE constipation, sour
stomach or gas. The INSTANT, easy
action of Adler-1-ka is surprising.

SLEEPER FOR GOVERNOR
1 JV'IV,F "

ALBERT E. SLEEPER
The time has arrived for Michigan
to have a business man for governor
and a business administration of the
affairs of this state.
The taxpayers have at last become
aroused to the burden of increasing
state expense and the costly "isms"
which have made such deep inroads
into the finances of Michigan.
The Expositor, after a careful study
of the situation and a thorough dis
cussion of the men whose names have
been offered by either political party,
endorses the candidacy of Albert E.
Sleeper, of Rad Axe, on the simple
basis that his name and his record in
sures a square deal to all of Michigan.
Mr. Sleeper was. a forceful and pro
ductive member of the state senate,
and his subsequent four years as state
treasurer demonstrated his keen busi
ness ability, his unquestioned integrity
and his devotion to those economies
which have become unfashionable in
so many departments of publio life.
Sleeper is a plain man of business,
with large experience, broad character
and a keen understanding of the detail
business of the state of Michigan.
With him as chief executive every
portion of Michigan, the largest 6tate
except one east of the Mississippi,
would feel the inspiration of harmon
ious state government.
Mr. Sleeper says "If I am elected
f;overnor, I will try to see that a dol
ar's worth of Bervice goes out for
every dollar of taxes that comes in."
