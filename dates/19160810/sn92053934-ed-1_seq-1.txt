RAIL CONFAB
AT NEW YORK
IS CONVENED
United States Board of Me
diation Opens Meet to
Prevent Strike.
STATUS IS UNCHANGED
Garretson, Chief of Work
ers, Declares Situation
. Remains the Same.
Nevr York, Aug. 10. The United
Stales board of mediation and concil
iation cer.ferre-1 today with represen
tatives of the tour railroad brother
tools of employes in its efforts to pre
vent a country-wide strike to enforce
the employes' demand for an eight
tour basic day and time and a half for
overtime.
"The star us is unchanged," was the
only eomnier.t of A. B. Garretson, head
of the conductors' brotherhood, after
the conference.
"We have only scratched the sur
face," said G. W. V. Hanger, a member
cf the mediation board.
The mediators arranged for a sec
cni conference with the railroad man
agers this afternoon and to meet the
Irotherhoods representatives again to
morrow morning.
The mediators held their first con
ference with the national conference
committee of railway managers yes
terday. These deliberations are secret.
Three Possible lUults.
There are three possible results of
the mediation. One is that the federal
board will be able to get the managers
and workers to sign an agreement.
Another is that the mediators will be
able to induce both parties to consent
,4irhitraCHn.- it-mediation fails. The
third possibility is that the federal
board will fail in both these endeavors.
It was predicted today that if the
board should be unable to compose the
differences. President Wilson would
ask representatives of the contending
factions to meet him in Washington
&ad that he would ask them to arbi
trate. It is understood the labor lead
ers pin their hopes upon mediation
rather than arbitration
W. S. Tarter, president of the Broth
erhood of Knpinemen and Firemen,
said: "Arbitration is a gambling game
even when the dice are not loaded.
Railway employes have lost faith in
the justice of arbitration boards."

Senate Gets
Isle Treaty;
Is Due Soon
Washington. Aug. 10. The treaty
by which the United States would ac
quire the Danish West Indies for $25,
000.000 recently signed by Secretary
Iansing and Danish Minister Brun
now is before the senate foreign rela
tions committee and probably will be
considered early next week. It became
know ntoday that the treaty was sent
to the senate in executive session
Tuesday and referred to the commit
tee without discussion.
At the request of the Danish for
eign office the terms of the convention
are to be considered confidential until
both governments agree to have them
announced.
The fact that $25,000,000 is the con
sideration to be paid by the United
States leaked out some time ago how
ever and in a general way the nature
of the document has been discussed.
It is understod that in return for
the cession of the islands of St. Thom
as, St. t'roix, St. John and "adjacent
island and rocks" with all public
buildings, fortifications, public funds,
rights and concessions belonging to
the Danish government, the United
States is to pay in gold the sum of
money stipulated within 90 days after
ratification of the treaty, maintain cer
tain grants, licenses and concessions
granted in the islands by Denmark
and guarantee the rights of Danish
citizens residing in the ceded territory.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee said consid
eration of the treaty would be has
tened and that it would be ratified by
the senate before adjournment this
session. He will call a meeting of the
committee early next week.
Ask Probe of Publication.
Investigation of the means by which
a confidential copy of the treaty un
der which the I'nited States would ac
quire the Danish West Indies for $25,
OoO.OOO became public was demanded
in the senate today by Senator Stone,
chairman of the foreign relations com
mittee. An abstract of the treaty published
this morning is believed to have been
made from one of 25 numbered copies
sent to the senate Tuesday by the
state department, with a letter trans
mitting a request of the Danish gov
ernment that the terms of the con
vention be withheld until the t.o gov
ernments agmeeTT t"5'fonxufgaie them:
"It is hard for me to believe," said
Senator Stone, "that any senator of
the United Slates would give this
treaty to the public under the circum
stances." Defends Senate Correspondents.
Senator Stone declared he thought
the correspondents in the senate press
gallery would not resort to dishonor
able methods in the acquisition of
news.
"I have no criticism of the corre
spondents" he continued, "but when a
great newspaper comes into posses
sion of a confidential communication
of this kind sent by the president of
the United States to the senate and
prints it to the detriment of the pub
lic interest, it is an entirely different
matter. Every senator and every pa
triotic American can have but one op
inion of such action."
The senator emphasized the impor
tance of secrecy because of the fact
that a similar treaty with Denmark
was interfered with and ratification
prevented several years ago.

in Flood; Aid
Hurried Out
Charleston, W. V., Aug. 10. Rescue
parties worked desperately today to
make their way up the Cabin creek
and Coal river valleys, which for 20
miles southward from the Kanawha
river, were devastated yesterday by a
cloudburst which left in its wake a
death toll estimated at more than 100
persons and a property loss of at least
$2,000,000.
At least eight villages and mining
settlements were either wholly or par
tially destroyed while many others felt
the effects o fthe storm more or less.
Those practically destroyed or badly
damaged were Acme, Ron da. Dry
Branch, Sharon, Dawes, Kayford and
Eskdale. Between Acme and Kayford
60 persons are reported to have been
drowned.
Two companies of the second regi
ment. West Virginia national guard,
entrained for the flood zone today with
tents, provisions and medical supplies.
Officials of the Chesapeake and Ohio
railroad said it would be at least two
weeks before travel could be resumed
in the Cabin creek valley.
Word was anxiously awaited from
the 300 passengers who were on board
an excursion train when it was mar
ooned near St. Albans.
Charleston, W. Va., Aug. 10. Twenty-three
bodies have been recovered
from the debris carried down by. the
flood which swept the Cabin creek val
ley near here yesterday. Rescue par
ties have penetrated some distance
above Cabin creek junction and mea
gre reports indicate that the loss of
life has been heavy although no ac
curate estimate can be made. Persons
driven from their homes to the moun
tains are returning to find whole vil
lages of mining cabins swept away,
while distress and suffering is seen on
every hand.
A special train was being made up
here on the Chesapeake and Ohio rail
road and will go as far as the hastily
repaired tracks will permit. Men pro
vided with provisions will seek out
the spots where destitution is most
pronounced.
Reports reached here today from
United States Commissioner Howard
C. Smith, who led a relief party last
night that looting had commenced and
a number of arrests had been made
and some porperty recovered. The
commander of the military has been

I
PAPER CRISIS IS
DUE IN OCTOBER
Reports From Federal Trade Commis
sion Situation Will Re Most Acute
as Contracts Expire.
"Washington, Aug. 10. The crisis in
the news print paper situation, which
already has cutdown newspaper pro
fits enormously will not be reached
till late October when contracts come
up for renewal, according to reports
received from many sources by the
federal trade commission. The presi
dential election, together with the
European war, is expected to increase
an already unparalleled demand for
news print which manufacturers tell
the trade commission they will hardly
be able to meet. This year, for the
first time, they have not been able to
lay up a large reserve 1 during the
summer
The trade commission's report on
its investigation of news print prices,
it was announced today, will be pub
lished not later than Oct. 1, regardless
of whether congress is still in session.
Probably a brief extract will be given
out two weeks before hand summariz
ing the findings. As yet the mass of
material has not been sufficiently di
gested for officials to indicate definitely
its trend.
The great question in deciding
whether there has been collusion
among the manufacturers to boost
prices unduly is said to be whether the
increased demand for paper has been
entirely disproportionate to the in
creased production. Manufacturers
claim that publishers are using 20 per
cent more paper than ever before.
Consumption figures presented to the
commission, however, vary widely. G.
F. Steele, secretary of the news print
manufacturers' association, has esti
mated that figures for June show "the
largest daily production of news print
ever recorded." Shipments, he de
clared, represented 99 per cent of this
production.
None of the substitutes for pulp re
cently suggested is commercially feas
ible, according to officials of the var
ious bureaus interested. Cotton
stalks, most frequently mentioned,
would be prohibitively expensive to
collect, they say. The same situation
holds for corn stalks, broom corn, rice
straw and flax. As yet the experi
ments have not passed the laboratory
stage and so far as is known no com
mercial use of the discoveries is con
templated anywhere.

IN ATTACK OF
ITALY FORGE
Duke Aosta's Army After
Capturing Gorizia Con
tinues Drive.
AUSTRO LOSSES HEAVY
Great Hordes of Retreating
Troops Being Taken by
Italians, Claim.
Taris, Ang. 19, (9:20 a. m.) A
Havas dispatch from Rome sajs
that the Duke of Aosta's army,
having passed the left bank of the
Isonzo, continues the pursuit of
the Austrians and that heavy loss
es particularly in respect of pris.
oners are being indicted on the
Austrians.
Town Not Ruined.
Rome, Aug. 10. Notwithstanding
the desperate fighting around Gorizia,
the city itself was not burned by the
Austrians or destroyed by the Italian
artillery fire; nor were the inhabitants
injured, these to the number of 20,000
having previously evacuated the city.
It was the desire the the Italian com
mander, General Cadorna, to save Gor
izia from destruction by the retreat
ing Austrians and to that end he em
ployed strategy.
After taking the mountain tops of
San Michele and Sabotino, he attacked
Gorizia from the front across the Ison
zo and also from the sides and rear.
When the Duke of Aosta, commander
of the third army, who was present
during the three days of lighting en
tered the city, Gorizia was found to be
deserted, save by great numbers- of
wounded and dying Austrians on the
outskirts. The duke was accompanied
by his cousin, the king. The only dam
age done by the Austrians was that
occasioned by their attempts to de
stroy military buildings filled with
large quantities of supplies.
Cross "Death Pass."
Fighting at the bridge across the
Isonzo at Podgora, leading into Gor
izia, was among the most sanguinary
episodes of the war.
Before this encounter, the bridge
had been named Death Pass. After the
Italian guns had obtained command o
Gorizia from the heights of Sabotino,
San Michele, Monte Fortin, Monte
Santo and Basso Fortin, Italian in
fantry advanced toward the bridge.
After the wildest fighting, in which 109
Austrians were drowned, the bridge
was taken. Entrance to the city then
was comparatively easy.
Describe Capture of Gorizia.
Rome, Wednesday, Aug. 10. The op
erations which led up to the capture of
Gorizia by the Italians are described
in the following official narrative giv
en out here tonight:
"The attack began on August 4 in
the Montfalcone section against Hills
85 and 121 east of Rocca. We stormed
a very powerful enemy works there,
taking 143 prisoners but the adversary
Chad placed in abandoned trenches
quantities of bombs which exploded,
giving off clouds of poisonous gases
just as our troops entered the cap
tured lines. Heavy masses of the ene
my then made counter attacks and our
troops stupefied or asphyxiated by the
gas, were forced to fall back to their
own trenches.
"On August 5 the artillery sounded
the enemy's whole front with the ob
ject of distracting his attention and
fixing the ranges accurately. On the
morning of August 6 our batteries op
ened fire simultaneously on the rocky
barrier which from Sabotino to Cavar-
