PRESS GANG MEET AT
LAKE METIG08HE
Bottineau Did Itself Proud Entertain­
ing Newspapermen and Ladies at
Mid-summer Convention
Lake Metigoshe came into its own
last Friday and Saturday as a summer
resort, and will get a great deal of de­
sirable advertising as such from the
newspapers of North Dakota. It all
came about through the summer meet­
ing of the North Dakota Press associa­
tion being held there on the days men­
tioned.
The press boys who braved the ele­
ments and went to the lake are enthu­
siastic over this beauty spot, and many
of the boys did not know that such a
beautiful body of water existed in
North Dakota, with such a splendid
setting of hills and natural forests.
The business sessions were, held on
Friday morning and afternoon, routine
business being the rule. However, the
matter of increased cost of materials
used in the printing business was
brought up for discussion through the
splendid address given by Mark I.
Forkner of the Langdan Republican.
The address was crowded with facts
and figures that proved that the news­
papers of the state were up against a
stone wall and their only relief was to
increase the subscription and advertis­
ing rates. It was also brought out by
the discussion that a colored man is in
the woodpile in regard to the increased
cost of paper stock and inks, particu­
larly black inks, and resolutions were
adopted requesting the congressmen
and senators from this state to use
their best efforts to back up the fed­
eral board of inquiry now in session
at Washington, D. C. The newspapei
men of North Dakota are up in arms
against what seems to be exhorbitant
prices that in turn force them to in­
crease their charges for subscription,
job printing and advertising. The faul'
lies with the mills and a rigid inquiry
is earnestly desred.
Resolutons were adopted deploring
the death of Alice Nelson Page of
Grand Forks, who had been a member
of the North Dakota Press association
for a number of years.
Resolutions were also adopted thank­
ing the Commercial club and good peo­
ple of Bottineau for the many cour­
tesies extended to the association.
Friday evening the Bottineau band
gave a delightful concert at the west
side hotel, which was followed by a
dance.
Saturday it rained nearly all day.
but the minor sports were pulled off
successfully, the balance of the day
being spent by the boys and their
wives in visiting from cottage to cot­
tage. In the evening an excellent ban­
quet was served in the east side hotel,
F. C. Falkenstein of the Bottineau
News acting as toastmaster.
Sunday morning devotional exer­
cises were held in the big tent, Rev.
Meyer of Bottineau preaching an ap­
propriate sermon, and exceptionally
good music being furnished by a male
quartet from Bottineau. In the after­
noon autos from Bottineau came up to
the lake and conveyed the press gang
to the city, where beginning at 9 o'­
clock a concert was given in the Ma­
sonic hall by the Bottineau band and
male quartet, which was one of the
most enjoyable features of the meet­
ing.
Taken by and large this summer
meeting was one of the most enjoy­
able in the history of the North Da­
kota Press association, and in future
years many of the press boys will jour­
ney to beautiful Lake Metigoshe and
relax for a few weeks during the heat­
ed season. Efforts should be made by
the citizens of Bottineau to exploit
the lake as a summer resort to the end
that our citizens would "See North
Dakota First." The press gang will
help.
Flower and Vegetable Exhibit at
Elks' Home August t7 and 18
Below will be given a resume of the
rules and regulations governing the
Flower and Vegetable Exhibit to be
held August 17 and 18, Thursday and
Friday, of next week, in the Elks'
Home. The City Beautifying League
desire greatly to make this exhibit a
display of unusual beauty and excel­
lence, and to further this end, have
asked and obtained help from men and
women whose tastes, training and ex­
perience qualify them admirably for
their positions as assistants and
judges.
But even though these competent
workers lend their aid, the exhibit can­
not succeed without the enthusiastic
co-operation of Minot's gardeners,
young and old, for these must contrib­
ute the foundation of success, the dis­
play itself. Tlie season has been un
usiAl and in some ways discouraging
but there is ample material in the city
for an excellent exhibit and it is to be
hoped that every person in Minot in­
terested in this line of work will make
an effort to send flowers and vege­
tables to be displayed next week.
Even though the gardener may feel
a diffidence as to the excellence of his
products, investigation will doubtless
reveal some one specimen or variety,
if not more, that is likely to hold its
own creditably with others at the ex­
hibit, and it must be remembered that
in addition to the many prizes offered
for single varieties of flowers and
vegetables, there are three prizes of­
fered for single varieties of flowers
and vegetables, there are three prizes
offered for the best collection of flow­
ers and three for the best collection of
vegetables, the first prize in each case
WW"**1'"
birysrr-^
being $4.00. Now $4.00 in cash is a
prize worth working for and the own­
er of any average garden might by
an unusually original and effective
arrangement of his collection win the
urize. Whether or not he won it, he
would have the pleasure of knowing
that he had contributed to the success
of the exhibit.
Prizes are offered for 21 varieties
of vegetables, viz.: stringless bush
beans, stringless pole beans, beets,
early cabbage, head lettuce, onions,
peas, potatoes, radishes, slicing cu­
cumbers, pickling cucumbers, summer
squash, turnips, endive, kohl-rabi, car­
rots, cauliflower, popcorn, sweet corn,
tomatoes and rutabagas.
Score Card for Vegetables
1. All vegetables are judged as to
their fitness for table use. Mere size
will not count, and in some cases
might be a detriment.
2. Exhibitors of several specimens
will be given preference over exhibits
of single specimens. Extremely large
quantities will not be given additional
preference. No set limit, however,
has been made in the matter, leaving it
rather to each exhibitor's judgment.
As an example, exhibits of peas and
beans should consist of about two
quarts each tomatoes, potatoes, on
iens, radishes, sweet corn, etc.. had
better consist of an exhibit of about
ten specimens cabbage, squash, etc.,
can better be limited to one of two
specimens. This refers, of course, to
exhibits of the single variety. In tho
matter of the display of a collection
of vegetables the amount used would
depend on the exhibitor's plan of ar­
rangement, number of vegetables ir.
the collection, etc.
3. General freshness in appear­
ance and arrangement of exhibition
will be considered in making awards.
4. In selecting specimens for ex­
hibition uniformity of size, color and
grade of sample is an advantage and
will be given tfye consideration.
Prizes will be given fc- the follow­
ing sixteen varieties of tuwers: Pan
sies, phlox, nasturtiums, ornamental
sun flowers, snap-dragons, sweet peas,
asters calliopsis, petunias, stack, an­
nual pinks, California poppy, portu
laca, poppies, dahlia and gladioia.
All exhibits are to be received be­
tween the hours of 9 and 12 Thursday
morning and all exhibitors must fur­
nish their own receptacles.
Score Card for Flowers
The judges will give the following
points particular attention:
(a) Number and beauty of colors
displayed in a single variety exhibit.
Number and beauty of color and va­
riety displayed in a collection exhibit.
(b) General size and vigor of
blooms.
(c) Freshness and vigor of entire
display including foliage.
(d) Effectiveness of the arrange­
ment of exhibits, as made by exhibitor
Entry will be made when the exhib­
its are presented at the Home. No
previous notification of intention to
display need be made. There is no
charge for entry. Any citizen of Mi­
not may exhibit, but adults are not
eligible for flower prizes, though they
are urged to exhibit.
No exhibit shall be entered for more
than one prize, and no exhibit shall be
eligible for more than one prize irre­
spective of the number of entries.
Any further information may be had
by telephoning Mrs. T. J. Vincent or
Mrs. C. B. Davis.

car and here is his affidavit upon its
splendid performance:
State of North Dakota,
County of Ward, SS.
I, Harry Dingman, on oath, depose
and say that I purchased an eight
cylinder Oldsmobile of the Minot Mo­

in its initial' trip to Westby, Mont.,
making my territory enroute, covering
a distance of 375 miles that the en­
tire trip was made on an average of
15 2-3 miles on a gallon of gasoline.
That 80 miles of the trip was made
through mud and over very heavy
roads. Further, that I made the
trip from Crosby to Minot, a distance
of 145 miles, on six gallons of gaso­
line (24 1-6 miles per gallon). On the
entire trip I used 1 1-2 pints of lubri­

GROSS PRINTERY
DAMAGED BY WATER
Water From Offices Above Leaks for
Hours Into Rooms Below, Doing
Considerable Damage
The Gross printing plant and office
were flooded Monday night by water
that ran in from the floor above. It is
estimated that about $250 damage was
done. The job stock was practically
ruined and the electric motor was put
out of business temporarily.
After the city water had been shut
off for the day on account of a break
in the mains, the faucet in the offices
above was left on. When the water
was turned on during the night the
water flowed steadily, flooding the
floor of Dr. J. W. Newlove and leaking
into the Gross plant below. The plas­
ter dropped from the ceiling and the
place presented a sorry looking sight
or. the morning. The shop was put
cut of commission for a day or two.
DESTRUCTIVE HAIL STORM
STRIKES SOUTH OF GRANO
Grano Tribune: Tuesday night the
dry, hot weather we have been having
was broken by a good rain. Unfor­
tunately it was accompanied by a hea­
vy wind and hail storm. To the south
and southwest of Grano many thous­
ands of acres of fine grain were de­
stroyed by the hail. The path of the
storm was about ten miles wide and
as near as can be learned about .15
miles long. Farmers reporting a total
loss on all or part of their grain in
this locality are M. C. Frederick, Robt.
Whiting, Walter Byrant, Chester
Ward, George Geyer, Dune Thompson,
Ed. McGuire, Emil Anderson, John
Lewis, H. S. Rapp, Pete Dinger, Ed.
Bryans, H. Swift, Christina Sattei-
lund, Joe Clementish, Henry Stem
mens, John Backus, Andrew Enerson,
Geo. Mittendorf, Ed. Miller, Dan Huff­
man, besides quite a number of others
who report partial losses.
The storm also demolished several
barns and granaries in the country to
the south of Grano. Among the things
the wind did was to blow Joe Clemen
tish's granary into the river and turn­
ed Ed. Miller's granary half way
around.
The damage done by the storm in
this vicinity is estimated at between
$100,000 and $110,000.
Most of the farmers who suffered
losses carried no insurance.
I. W. W. Headquarters
Two I. W. W.'s entered the police
station boldly Saturday morning and
inquired for the I. W. W headquarters
in Minot. Officer Reed opened a cage
and said, "There are the headquar­
ters walk in."
Later they were taken out of town
in the police patrol and told to stay
away from Minot.
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
Two mobs gathered around the jail,
one a band of 150 I. W. W.'s who made
threats to tear down the jail and turn
the murderer loose, and another mob
of about 150 farmers who threatened
to lynch Luchowski
Alter hours of cross examination,
the man made a written confession.
He admitted that he killed Larson with
a heavy scale weight, after he had
quarrelled with his employer. He said
that Larson had struck him on the
head with a rock while on their way
to a hay field.
Larson was 27 years of age and sin­
gle. The officers knew there was no
question as to Luchowski's guilt. When
he was arrested blood was found on
his clothing.
Numerous mysterious fires, highway
robberies, assaults and continual re­
fusal to work for other than outrage­
ous wages, all culminating in the mur­
der of Louis Larson, have so aroused
the southwestern North Dakota farm­
ers that clans resembling the old Ku
Klux are being organized to rid the
country of the I. W. W.'s.
Stork Partial to the Boys
That old, faithful bird, the stork,
helped out the vital stastics in Minot
Tuesday to the extent of three. The
wise old bird appears to be partial, for
he left sons at the homes of Geo. A.
McGee, Ray Kann and Thos. Forde.
Mrs. Truax to Kansas City Meeting
Mrs. C. F. Truax of this city, who is
president of the Womans Relief Corps
state organization, will attend the na­
tional meeting of the W. R. C. at Kan­
sas City Aug. 28 to Sept. 2. This meet­
ing will be held in connection with the
Golden Jubilee of the G. A. R. and will
be one of the most important in the
history- of those organizations.

Hi
jThe Northern States Power company
hit applied for an electric light fran­
chise at Berthold and this will un­
doubtedly be granted at an early date.
Manager McGuire states that just as
soon as the franchise is granted the
company will start operations on the
building of the electric line from Bur­
lington to Berthold, taking in Des Lacs
ana Lone Tree on the way. A num­
ber of farms enroute will be electri-
Mr. McGuire hopes to have the
line installed this fall and will be able
to do so in case that transformers can

#The old McCIure Coal company it
Tisker, now known as the Dakota Coal
cdmpany, has asked for an electric
sjjur to the mine and the Northern
States Power Co. will extend its line
t4 Tasker from Berthold as soon as
the main line is completed. The Da­
kota Coal company will install an
electric engine and two immense slio
eife which will cut right into the b^d
o^ coal at any angle, cutting out any
tmckness of coal desired.
!The Berthold village council pas^ei!

Tuesday providing for the franchise.
IThe Northern States Power cm
p£ny is installing a 400 kilowatt unit
afi the power plant in this city, which
will give them ample power for the
proposed new line. The plant will have
1JL50 kilowatts, equal to 1.800 horse
power, as soon as this unit is installed.
JThere will probably be no addition­
al) units planned for the local power
piknt and when others are needed, it
is possible that anew power plant will
bq built at one of the mines, BurHng

NORTHWESTERN
PART OF STATE
TERESTED IN PLANT
Practical Business Methods Would Dic­
tate the Location of Equity
Plant at Minot
Ever since the first intimation that
the Society of Equity was figuring
upon locating a large packing plant
somewhere in the state the northwest­
ern portion of the state has been very
much interested in the proposition, and
many excellent arguments have been
put forth relative to its location at
?.Iinot. These arguments have not
been founded upon sentimentality but
upon sound business principles.
A plant such as the Society of Equi­
ty is figuring upon must of necessity
be located somewhere near the center
of the producing country, and also be
nearer the ultimate market for the
nished product. The town must have
the very best railway facilities, so that
the most remote corners of the area
from which raw material is raised can
be shipped quickly and thereby save
considerable shrinkage. From the
fact that more people by 30 per cent
can come to Minot and return to their
homes in the state within twenty-four
hours certainly proves that if the
packing plant is located at Minot that
quick delivery is possible with freight
as well.
The packing plant cannot hope to
secure much eastern trade for the fin­
ished product, therefore, it is well to
have the plant located in the western
part of the state, preferably, of course,
in a city that has the best railway fa­
cilities. Outside of one city asking
for the plant. Minot is the farthest
west of any of the cities in the state,
but the other city only has one main
line of raliway, so that cannot offer
much in the way of real inducements.
The plant must be located in a city
where there are ample power, water
and sewerage facilities, and no city in
the state can measure up to Minot in
these particulars.
In 1910 and 1911 when the crojjs
were not just what could be wished
for, the northwestern portion of North
Dakota turned quickly to cattle and
hog raising to the end that that por­
tion of the state furnishes an immense
amount of beef and pork that is ship­
ped out of the state at the present
time. One instance will suffice to prove
this assertion. In 1912 there were
shipped out of one county in the north­
western part of this state 19 carloads
of all kinds of stock. The year fol­
lowing—1913—95 carloads were ship­
ped out.
The Northwestern Stock Show, held
at Minot in July of this present year,
proved that the northwestern part of
this state is strong for the cattle and
hog game. Eastern Montana is al'o
getting into the game with a rush, so
that much of the raw material of a
packing plant in North Dakota would
come from there. Minot has excellent
railway facilities to bring this raw
material to this city.
Minot is the logical city in Which to
locate the Equity plant, and we hope
to see the Society of Equity select the
city for this important industry.
GENERAL MANAGER PAYS
BUSINESS VISIT TO MINOT
R. A. Horr of Duluth, Chief Mogul of
Stone-Ordean-Wells Co., Pleased
With Minot Conditions
R. A. Horr, general manager of the
Stone-Ordean-Wells Co., with Duluth
as his headquarters, was in the city
Monday, conferring with the local
manager, Ira D. Wight, and the other
representatives of this well known con­
cern. He had visited Great Falls,
Billings and Missoula, Mont., where
the company has branch houses. Mr.
Horr stated that conditions through­
out Montana are excellent. He is well
pleased with the showing made by the
Minot house. During the first six
months of this year, all records were
broken by this branch, with the best
part of the year ahead. While crops
are not as good in the Minot territory
as a year ago, Mr. Ilorr feels certain
that the business is going to show a
nicc steady growth. With the very
high price for farm products of all
kinds and considering the fine showing
the farmers of this territory made last
year, Mr. Horr states that his com­
pany is going to be able to continue
its line of credits in as liberal a man­
ner as ever.
Early Minot Publisher .Member
of G. A. Ii. Committee
J. N. Baker, Commander of Post 05,
G. A. R., of this city, has received an
invitation to attend the Greater Kan­
sas City Fiftieth G. A. R. "Golden
Jubilee" Encampment the week of
August 28 to Sept. 2. Arrangements
are being made for reunions of all reg­
iments represented. The First Vice
Chairman of the entertainment com­
mittee is Homer B. Mann, a former
Minot newspaperman, now a member
of the firm of Brown. Mann & Bar
num, Kansas City. Mr. Mann was a
resident of Minot nearly a quarter of
a century ago and in company with C.
A. Johnson, now one of the publishers
of the Optic-Reporter, published the
Minot Journal. Many of the old tim­
ers who remember Mr. Mann will be
pleased to leam that he has been very
successful in a business way in the
southern city.
Cando Here for Fast Series.
The Minot ball team has been put­
ting up some mighty scrappy games,
much better than earlier in the season.
Up until Monday night, our team won
the last eight games played. Minot
won the series with Knox which closed
Tuesday evening, winning five out of
the six games.
The fast Cando team will start in
today for a three game series, Aug
10, 11 and 12. Cando has just finished
a series with Williston for the state
championship. At this writing, two
games have been played, each team
winning one. Cando played Minot last
year, Minot winning the series. These
games promise to be the best of the
season and large crowds should at­
tend.
COST OF POWER
Consumers Power Company Change
Schedule for Power Current
In This City
A change has been made in the price
of electricity by the Consumers Pow­
er company of this city, effective Aug.
1, which reduces the cost of current
to the plants of the city considerably.
The larger reductions are on the small­
er amounts used, but these cover the
quantity used by practically all the
electrically operated plants in the city.
The new rate per k. w. h. per month
gross, subject to a discount of ten per
cent under the provisions of the com­
pany, are as follows:
First 500, 6.66 cents.
Next 500, 5.55 cents.
Next 1,000, 5 cents.
Next 1,000, 4.5 cents.
Next 2,000, 4.25 cents.
Next 5,000, 4 cents.
The old rates were as follows:
First 100, 9 cents.
Next 200, 8 cents.
Next 300, 7 cents.
Next 400, 6 cents.
Next 1,000, 5 cents.
Next 1,000, 4.5 cents.
There are no plants in the city using
more than 3,000 per month so that the
reduction in prices can be determined
from the above figures. The reduc­
tions on the amounts above that point
are small, but the consumers get. the
advantage of the reduction in the
smaller quantities.
Hodge Will Buy Grain at Bordulac
P. L. Hodge, one of the best known
grain dealers in this section of the
state, 'will leave Monday for Bordulac,
N. D., where he will take charge of the
Farmers' elevator as buyer. Mr. Hodge
will move his family to Bordulac in
about a month, but Mr. Hodge states
that in reality he will retain his resi­
dence in Minot, where he has lived for
so many years, and where his friends
are legion.
FIRST
SECTION
Notwithstanding Difficulties the Boys
Made A Record.Results Prove
Very Satisfactory
Plattsburg, N. Y., July 28.—Major
General Leonard Wood, accompanied
by one of his aids, Captain Halstead
Dorey, spent two hours yesterday with
the machine gun detachment in a try
out of an Indian armored side-car, op­
erated by First Lieutenant Philip Gor­
don, of the Second cavalry, who is in
command of the machine gun deatcfe
ment, composed of regulars and busi­
ness men.
There was but one motorcycle with
armored side car used and this was
ridden by Lieutenant Gordon and two
privates, the Benet machine gun be­
ing carried, but no swivel attached to
the side car. The balance of the ma­
chine gun detachment accompanied
on horseback, and General Wood and
his aid also rode horses.
Mean Place for Tryout
The location selected for the exper­
iment was three miles west of the
camp, in the meanest kind of soil that
could be found, sandy and full of old
tree stump:-: and bushes as high as the
men on the motorcycle. To reach the
location the men went out over tho
Peru road and when nearing the rail­
road tracks turned into the stumpy
ground, reducing the motor's speed
from about 50 miles an hour to about
20, and at that rate Lieutenant Gor­
don. with one man sitting on the rear
of the motorcycle and one in the arm­
ored car, underneath which was a box
containing 600 rounds of ammunition,
picked his way in and around stumps
and over bushes. Reaching a small
stream, where it was feared that the
machine might become stalled, the
party stopped and in 20 seconds had
detached the car from the motorcycle,
taken the motorcycle across, gone back
and pulled the car over and reattach­
ed the two and were on their way.
Bringing the machine to a stop a
little further on, the lieutenant sprang
to the ground and one man followed
with several hundred rounds of am­
munition, while the third detached the
armored car and hurried to the rear
quite a distance with the motorcycle,
where it was hid in the bushes. The
idea was that if the enemy rushed in
the three men could get away on the
motorcycle, the third man holding on
to the second man and leaving the
armored car to be captured.
Test Was Pleasing.
The speed made in the test waa
pleasing to the general and he was
loud in his praise of the work done by
the motorcycle, personally compliment
menting Hal H. Noyes of Springfield,
Mass., who is not only here as the rep
sentative of the Hendee Manufactur­
ing company, who make the Indian
machine, but the civilian commander
of the motorcycle corps so far estab­
lished. The company has several ma­
chines at the camp and it is the duty
of Noyes to break in the soldetrs, prin­
cipally regulars, in the riding, 'hand­
ling and care of the machines. There
are about a dozen of these men now
who have under bis mechanical eye,
become expert riders and men fully
capable of taking a machine apart and
putting it together again.
In the test the machine and side car,
with three men. did what would be re
quired of throe horses, one pack mule,
requiring four men and the reader
can judge for himself how quickly the
motorcycle left a point and reached
another in comparison to what time
would be required for the three horses
and pack mules to do the same thing.
In the first place the machine left
camp covering the three and one-quar­
ter miles in four minutes and a half.
Horses could have made a short cut
by going over the railroad bed. saving
a mile, but from 10 to 12 minutes
would be required to reach the same
spot even then.
HANS WAS A STANDPATTER
Hans Schmidt appeared before the
pearly gates for his final judgment.
"Well," said St. Peter, "Your rec­
ord does not appear to be perfectly
clear. If certain discrepancies could
be explained no doubt you would be
entitled to enter, but the way the rec­
ord reads now, I cannot let you in."
Just then there came a loud, re­
sounding knock on the outer door. St.
Peter left the examination of Hans to
let the new arrival into the corridor.
He was gone a few minutes and when
he returned he said. "Hans, there is
a kindly gentleman out there who says
he can clear up the discrepancies in
your record so you can pass."
"Dat so?" said Hans. "Do know
him? Vat iss his name?"
"His name," said St. Peter, "is
Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt."
"Veil," said Hans, "It vill have to
go de vay it is, den, for I vill go to
hell before I vill let dot man Roose­
velt help me stay out."—F. W. Bis

SELLING WORTHLESS WARE
An agent has been driving through
