along?" "Is he Mill living?" "I)
you remember when we?"
J. II. 11. Maxwell, captain of the
lioone County Confederate Camp, in
terrupted the story-telling feast with
an announcement that a meeting
would he held in the Circuit Court
Room. The veterans gathered their
canes and leaned on them heavily
when climbing the stairs. In bring
ing the meeting to order, after same
dilliculty because of the continuous
buzz about wars and raids and person
al heroisms, Mr. Maxwell made a rec
ord of the veterans present and their
service in the war. This information,
the chairman explained, would aid
in obtaining better pensions.
Calls for C. A. R. Men.
The veterans used their hands as
ear trumpets and talked excitedly and
lingered their hats nervously when
asked about their services. Almost
all of them were dressed in the sober
old fashioned stvle.
About thirty answered the roll call.
Mr .Maxwell called for the G. A. R.
men to come up and register. Onlj
two of them showed up which disap
pointed the chairman, and he wel
comed the two Cnlon soldiers to live
and associate with their old enemies.
The two "Northerners" were .1. S.
Knochs of the Missouri Volunteers,
and .1. W. Chace of the Missouri infan
try. Mrs. C. W. Sebastian sang "My Own
Cnited States."
At 12 o'clock the meeting adjourned
to the lower floor where the Daughters
of the Confederacy had arranged two
long tables of dinner for the veterans.
In the afternoon Mr. Maxwell called
on several old confederates to talk.
W. T. Anderson, president of the lioone
County Mill, broke into tears when he
iccalled some of the military opera
tions around Missouri. He spoke of
Robert E. Lee as the greatest general
that ever lived.
Several others when called on com
plained that they had neer made a
speech In their life, and then started
on a recital of their experiences in
the Sixties.

With a drought lasting already for
a few months and no relief as yet in
sight, truck farm owners in and
around Columbia are giving up hope
of seeing a greater part of their prod
ucts go on the market. Almost eii cry
thing has been dried up, and condi
tions are not ccn favorable enough
to allow- the fall gardening a chance
to come up above ground.
"If we get a good deal of rain with
in a week we may be able to sae the
sweet potatoes and beans," said a
man connected with the Oakland
Truck Farm. "But it is entirely too
late for most of the products. They
are completely spoiled. There is
nothing that can save them."
"But tomatoes are not suffering at
all. We feel satisfied so far as they
are concerned."
Bryce Edwards, of the Sunny Slope
Farm, who supplies practically the
whole of Columbia, said that there is
a famine in home-grown butter beans
and peas. "They are not even shipped
in, and Columbia does without them,
It is a little different with cabbages.
there are not any of them grown here
either, but many are shipped in."
"There haven't been any butter
beans and peas on the market for a
month. All of it has been ruined by
the drought I have been here for
five years, and this is the worst pe
riod of drought that we have had.
"We hae enough tomatoes and cu
cumbers, although lots of them have
been burned. I hae enough here to
supply Columbia and I could have
picked a few more bushels. Of course
the reason tomatoes are so plentiful
is that there were so many planted,
and despite the drought Uiere are
enough to supply the demand. And
then again, you see we irrigate our
tomatoes, and, rain or no rain, we
have enough for the whole town."
"We also have plenty of vegetables
that will pull through the drought
because they were planted in good
bottom ground. There are fifteen
acres of this bottom ground that can
bring out good products despite the
weather. Canteloupes have been grown
here and there are enough of them.
"Turnips, beets, spinach, and cab
bages must be planted in July and Au
gust. Rut there is little chance this
year for there being any of these. For
cabbages there is no possibility at
all."

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Aug.

passage of the constitutional amend
ment permitting women to vote the
Woman's patty met here today. What
the new party will do at the polls No
vember T will be settled at the confer
ence of the national executive commit
tee starting tonight.
Leaders from the twelve suffrage
states composing the party, claim to
control 4,000,000 votes, which they
will use to force the passage of the
Susan B. Anthony amendment. If the
Democrats don't ehow signs of passing
it quickly the women declared today,
those votes will go to Republican Pro
hibition, Progressive, Socialist or
wherever they will do the most good.
"The Prohibitionists and Socialists
are clamoring for our support," said
Miss Mabel Vernon, secretary of the
Women's party, "But we do not want
to lose our votes and we want to pun
ish our enemies."
Miss Vernon "Mad on Democrats.
Miss Vernon, who attracted wide at
tention by hecklin.g President Wilson
at the dedication of the Iibor Temple
at Washington, is "mad on" the Demo
cratic party.
"From the Democrats we have gain
ed nothing we do not expect we ever
will. From the President down the
party is opposed to the passage of the
amendment," said Miss Vernon.
"The one plank of the Woman's par
fv is the enfranchisement of all women
on equal terms with men and we stand
with those who help us attain tin's
end."
"Every state has enough indepen
dent women voters to turn the bal
ance for one party or the other, if such
women are organized. The Democra
tic platform is an insult to the women
of America, offering only a suffrage
sop.
"If Mr. Hughes takes his cue from
'he Republican platform," continued
Miss Vernon, "and offers only such
tepid support as is found there, the
voting women of the country, repre
sented at the conference here, will
mark out a course to pursue during
the campaign and at the election.
Democrats Have Chance In Retrieve.
"The Democrats may retrieve the
last by passing the Anthony amend
ment through the present Congress.
This would enable many of our mem
bers like .Mrs. Harriet Stanton Blach,
Mrs. Sara Bard Field and others, to
campaign and vote for Mr Wilson.
"We are not depending on the party
bound women to help us out, because
they are as partisan as men. We are
counting on the independent women
voters."
A reception for the members of the
new party was given this afternoon
at Austin Bluffs, the home of Mrs. Leo
nard E. Curtis.
Miss Anne Martin of Reno, chairman
of the national committee of the par

Mrs. Florence Bayard Hilles, Wil
mington. Del., "Individual liberty is
the essential basis of free government.
and under our form of government
both political expediency and political
justice demand the enfranchisement
of women. The hopeless task of state
referendums has taught women the
necessity of concentration on the fed
eral amendment. Undoubtedly enough
states are now won to enable the most
skeptical observer to see the political
power already in the hands of women
is sufficient to win freedom for all the
women of the Cnited States."

Mrs. William Kenf, Calif.. "The wo

demand their rights, and they propose
