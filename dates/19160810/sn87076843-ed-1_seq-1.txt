Drought Having Serious Effect
Upon Crops Throughout State.
Tho wheat harvest is i'ar enough
advanced that an estimate of the
yield may bo made with approxi
mate correctness. Correspondents
of this department estimate the
production at 70 per cent com
pared with a normal production of
15 bushels per acre. The estimated
acreage harvested was 1,577,352
acres. Total production should be
approximately 1G,5G2,19G bushels,
being. 19,4G8,042 bushels short of
1 915 crop.
Oats show a decrease of 2 per
cent in prospect compared with
estimate of one month ago. The
outlook is most discouraging. The
severe drought has cut the crop
short.
Clover hay will produce an
average of l.G tons per acre.
Timothy put away in best condi
tion for many years with an esti
mate of 104 per cent compared
with an average.
Potatoes show serious damage
by drought and bugs and in some
localities won't produce half a
crop. The general state prospect
is estimated at 70 per cent com
pared with a normal yield, a de
crease of 19 points compared with
estimate of one month ago.
Apples and peaches are reported
is dropping badly. Apples being
I'stimated at 55 per cent compared
with an average, and peaches at
4!) per cent.
So little infestation by Hessian
fly has been reported in Ohio this
year that entomologists at the
Ohio Experiment Station are now
advising farmers that wheat may
be seeded at the usual dates this
fall without serious damage from
this insect. If the pest has been
noticeable in any district, com-
niunity organization may be effee
tive ill its control.
Last year an organization of
farmers in Miami county and
vicinity reduced the infestation by
Hessian ily in this year's crop in
that section to the normal. Tn sev
eral years immediately preceding
wheat growing there had been a
gamble. The change came by the
farmers waiting for the specialists
of the Experiment Station to give
the signal to sow. Wheat was not
seeded before October. In this
way the fly was avoided.
The time for seeding and other
facts on wheat culture arc given in
Bulletin 298, which may be ob
tained from the Experiment Sta
tion at Wooster.

PERRYSBURG CENTENNIAL
One Hundredth Birthday to be
Celebrated in Appropriate
Manner.
Perrysburg people will celebrate
the 100th anniversary of the
town's birth by a splendid cele-'
bration on
Thursday, August 24th, 1916,
in which every citizen is cordially
invited and earnestly urged to par
ticipate. Although the meetings for mak
ing necessary arrangements are
held nt the Civic Association
rooms, it should he understood
that every person is invited to be
present, whether or not he is a
member, and to participate in the
work of making Perrysburg Cen
tennial a great success. There is
room for every worker and all will
be made welcome and given a
place where they can do the most
good.
Plans now provide for a pageant
representing ten decades of his
torical events that have been in
cidental to the development of the
village during the past 100 years.
These periods will be represent
ed by allegorical floats especially
arranged for the occasion, and the
people of the dates represented
will be correctly costumed.
Following' the historical and in
the same pageant will be repre
sentations of the business houses
of the town, followed by decorated
automobiles.
Every church and fraternal
organization of the village is in
vited to participate in the pageant.
Positions in the Civic parade
will be assigned by lot, so that no
partiality may he shown.
One hundred school children are
now in training under the direc
tion of Miss Bertha Ilillabrand,
and they will render several vocal
numbers on the program.
The committee in charge of the
program desire that all committees
and individuals having in charge
any portion of the pageant or
taking any part whatever therein,
should understand that the pag
eant will move promptly at 1:30
p. in. arid will not be delayed to
aecommoditte any person or ex
hibit which may not bo ready.
Such action is necessary in order
to complete the afternoon program
before supper time.
All floats, exhibits and character
representations and organizations
intended for the pageant will
rendezvous on Indiana avenue not
later than 1 p. m., where they will
be assigned positions by the com
mittee in charge.
The committee announce the fol
lowing :
Pageant will form on Indiana
avenue, right resting on. Locust
street, and extending ' east on
Indiana avenue.
Promptly at 1 :30 p. m., the pag
eant will move west to Louisiana
avenue; east on Second street to
Hickory; north to Front; west on
Front to Pine; south to Second;
east on Second to Louisiana,
to Front, countermarch south on
Louisiana avenue to Library and
disband.
It is believed the pageant will
he one hour in making the inarch
and will therefore disband at 2 :30
p. m.
Cure for Cholera Morbus.
"When our little boy, now seven
years old, was a baby, ho was cured of
cholera morbus by Chambcrluin's
Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy,"
writes Mrs. Sidney Simmons, Fair
nuven, in. x. "since then other mem
bers of my family have used this valu
able medicine for colic and bowel trou
bles with good satisfaction, and I
gladly endorse it as a remedy of excep.
tlonnl morjt." Obtainable oyorywhoro,
During the hour which will
elapse between the disbanding of
the parade and the opening of the
speaking program, the Fremont
Light Guard band of 28 imisicians
will give a band concert at Hood
Park.
The speaking and musical pro
gram will open at 3 :30 p. m.
A platform will be erected on
the east bank, opposite the park,
from which the program will be
given.
The program as now arranged
promises a very interesting two
hours or more, and if the weather
permits the entire afternoon's cel
ebration will prove worthy the
time, the place and the people.
There are many people who have
not contributed to tho Centennial
fund and they are invited to call
at either of our village banks where
their contributions will be thank
fully received. Any amount from
a jitney to a million bucks will be
accepted. Drop it in the box or
hand to the bank clerk.
The program for tho afternoon
has been partially arranged but
will not be published until next
week. It should be understood
that it will commence promptly at
3:30 p. m. and will continue about
two hours.
It should be remembered that on
this date the entire program and
all features of the celebration ore
free to everybody.
After supper the band will give a
concert and it has been suggested
that the evening be made a Car
nival night in which every citizen,
old and young, is invited to par
ticipate, by dressing in costume,
masked or unmasked as may please
the individual and promenade the
streets and make the evening one
general jollification. The throwing
of confetti will be permissible, but
any person engaged in throwing
flour, talcum or other destructive
articles will be promptly arrested
by officers who will mingle with
the crowds.
The costumes for those partic
ipating in the pageant will be sup
plied by a Detroit costumer and
will be historically correct.
To Dr. W. H. Rheinfrank is due
much credit for the conception and
planning of the historical pageant.
In this work he is assisted by C. P.
Champney, George Emmerich and
John Aon as the Pageant com
mittee. Mr. R R. Hartshorn is the com
mittee on Decorations and is busy
planning the decorations for the
streets along the line of march.
The Program for the day is in
charge of the following committee:
E. L. Blue, G. B. Lownsbury, T.
M. Franey, Geo. J. Munger and R.
R. Hartshorn, and this committee
will be pleased to have any sug
gestions or assistance from every
person who desires to make the
Centennial a.success.
Other committees are working
equally hard in their endeavor to
make the celebration a credit to
tho village.
Just the Thing for Diarrhoea.
"About two years ago I had a se
vere attack of diarrhoea which lasted
over a week," writes W. C. Jones, Bu-
ford, N. D. "I became so weak that I
could not stand upright. A druggist
recommended Chaftnberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. The
first dose relieved mo and within two
days I was as well as over." Many
druggists recommend this remedy be
cause they know that it is reliable. Ob

IN time of death the bank account proves itself the BEST KIND of
insurance. You can get your money IMMEDIATELY and without
question. During life the hank account proves EQUALLY VAL
UABLE, provided it is kept at a figure that really insures, and it pays
BETTER INTEREST. Get your cash in the bank. Leave it there. You
can't beat that kind of insurance. This requires DETERMINATION
and sometimes SELF SACRIFICE. But it pays. A bank account WITH
US is your BEST POLICY.
