devastation throuKhout the district.
Advices tonight were BM(VbW owinji
to Interrupted wire and rail roiiiniwtii
cation but various reports estimated
the Iobb of life at from 11 to 150 per
sons. The property darrage was placed
at no less than 1 1,000,00(1.
Two companies of (he second regi
ment, West Virginia national guard, in
camp at KanawhCity, near hero, was
tonight ordered to the flood section
with (ents and supplies by Governor
Hatfield. Relief trains are being made
up here und will depart within n few
hours.
Eleven Bodies Recovered
Local officials of the Virginia I'ower
Company asserted the loss of life
would reach 150. Rleven bodieei have
so far been rovered, (hree at Cabin
Creek Junction and eight at Dry
Branch. Scores of houses have been
swpt down the two streams, which
swollen by the heavy ruins, overflowed
their bunks carrying everything before
them.
More than thirty houses were count
ed passing one point In Cabin Creek
today. Many of the houses crashed
into the pier of the C. & O. railroad
bridge which had been earlier waBhed
out and demolished. Late today a boy
was seen on top of one of tho houses
An effort to rescue him failed and he
disappeared in the water.
lMrnlr Train Marooned
The damage to railroads, coal, oil
and gas properties through out the
state is especially heavy. Practically
every coal operation as well as the
plant and lineB of the Virginia I'ower
Company arc idle.
Two passenger trains, one of which
is a Sunday school excursion train
carrying 300 persons, are marooned
near St. Albans and efforts to roach
them have failed.
A telephone message from Tavern
Creek at 10:30 o'clock tonight, from
Howard Smith, chief of the special
agents on duty in the stricken dis
trict, was to the effect that at that
time the rescuers had been able to
penetrato us far us Miami, six miles
from the mouth of the creek. Kvury
thlnK up to that hour was In ruins and
the si(ua(ion was growing worse us
tlie waters advanced toward the head
waters.
The cloudburst occurred at the
headwaters of I'aint and Cabin creeks
and Coal river, and the lorren( which
surged down Coal river swept lis
bauks almost clea of villages, while
he Kanawha river rose several feut
carrying ou its crest houses and build
ings of all kinds.

What Did Robinson Crusoe Do
With Friday on Saturday Night?
He brought him down to Merz Bros, and bought for him at
reduced prices a pair of shoes, a suit of athletic underwear for
39c, a pair of silk sox for 15c, an Eagle silk shirt for $1.25 and
some red tab collars for 5c.
On these purchases he received tickets on the $25 talking
machine and Robinson and Friday left the store in a happy
mood for they realized how much they had gained by their stay
in the store.
