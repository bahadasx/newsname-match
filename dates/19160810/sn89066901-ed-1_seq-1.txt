Hurt in Auto Wreck
What might have been . a fatal
accident occurred at, the; Woods
Fork bridge near Hartville at one
o'clock Monday afternoon, when
Rev. T. J. Gideon's a'uto plunged
over the embankment, injuring
the three occupants of the car
and also damaging the-machine.
Rev. Gideon had purchased the
car, a Ford, from W.jG. Reynolds
of Mansfield and was jusHearn
ing to drive.' . In company with
Mr. Pond of Bolivar, who has
been visiting at Hartville,. and a
you'ag man named Willis he had
made the trip to ' Mansfield and
was returning home.. Mr.', Pond
had been ' driving and teaching
Mr. Gideon. They had .crossed
the bridge when Mr. Gideon gave
the wrong turn and the car went
over .the embankment, spilling
out the occupants' and turning
over three times,' alighting up
right at the bottom of the creek.
That the men were not:; killed
outright is little short of miracu
lous. Rev. Gideon was . cut and
bruised tfljout theheud and con
siderably shaken up. One of the
wheels of thecar went over Mr.
Pond in his trip over the embank
ment, but he was not badly hurt.
Mr. Willis was scratched ur some
what. . The boulders on. the em
bankment is probably saved the
men from death, as they struck
the rocks and the car went over
them Mr. Gideon had on glasses
but they were not broken. The
windshield of the Ford was brok
en, the top was broken aud other
damage done, but the headlights
were nothroken..iThe Ford surely
demonstrated that it could 'un
dergo rough treatment with but
slight damage. ItMs a wonder
that it was not totally Demolished.
If there is such a thing, we call.
this a lucky" accident in that it
did not result more seriously al)
around: ' The . first car to rejcji
