HOPELESSLY APART
United States Board of Mecfiation Has
Offered Its Services to Bring the
Railroads and Their Employes Ti
gether in an Amicable Settlement of
Points in Dispute, But Garretson
Declares That Unless the Railroads
Make Satisfactory Concessions the
Employes Will Refuse to Bind Them
selves to Federal Mediation.
NEW YORK, Aug. 9—If tile United
Slates board of mediation and concili
ation, which was called in today, fails
to adjust the differences between the
railroads of the country and their
409,000 employes, President Wilson
will be asked to use his personal in
fluence to avert a general strike. This
statement was made today by a repre
sentative of the railroad managers,
who have been negotiating witli the
men since June 1, for a peaceful set
tlement.
The appeal to the president would
lie the last resort and would he taken
only to save the nation from the trade
paralysis that would follow a strike
of the magnitude planned by the rail
road men.
Late ton'ght efforts of the federal
mediators to bring tlie contending tac
tions together were well under way.
Six hours after the railroad managers
had served notice on the men they
would not withdraw their formal re
jection of the workers' demands and
had proposed federal mediation, the
mediators and the managers were
closeted in secret session. Med'ation
was suggested in lieu of arbitration
under the Newlands act, or by the
interstate commerce proposals, which
had been rejected by the brother
hoods.
What was discussed at the con
ference could not be divulged by any
of (hose attending it under the media
tion rules, but it was understood that
the railroad representatives outlined
their position in full rod indicated
how far they were willing to go in
mooting the demands of the men It
was reported that the railroads stood
stpadfnstlv for the main feature of
tiieir "contingent proposal,'' made at
the June conference, which conceded
the shorter day. but eliminated double
ermnensation for different elasses of
service during the same working day.
it was the failure of the representa
tives of tlip railroads and the unions
(o agree on ti e double compensation
clause that brought the June confer
ence to a sudden end and resulted in
the strike vote.
The railroad managers, in present
ing their case to the mediators, were
assisted hv throe experts on wages
and rates, J. W. Higgins, former sec
retary of the Association of Western
Railroads; O. .T Waller, secretary of
the bureau of information of the ea t
ern railways; and Charles P. Neil,
manager o f the bureau of information
of the southeastern railways.
Tomorrow it was announced by O.
W. W. Hanger, a member of flip hoard,
the mediators will hear the railroad
employes' side of the case. Then the
board will hold alternate conferences
with the ooposing forces, Mr. Hanger
said. When a basis for an under
standing has been reached, the ra'l
roads and men will lie separately
asked if tlipv desire to place their
ease in the hands of the board for
final adjudication. If (lie answer is
ill the affirmative, the contending
forces will have to abide liy the de
cision of the board.
It was pointed out hv Mr. Hanger,
however, that acceptance of the
board's proffer of services is pot ob
ligatory on either side and if the
1 rotherhoods refuse to accept the good
offices of tiie mediators in reaching a
settlement, then the situation will
pts"d inst as it was before the me
diators stepped in.
A. R. Garretson. president of the
