LOCAL ATTORNEY QUITS
REPUBLICAN PARTY
Hurry H. MeKlroy, 11 prominent lo
cnl uttornoy, Iiuh wltlulrnwii from the
Republican party and aligned himself
with thu Prohibition parly, as will be
noticed by the following letter niul
call for a meeting of the delegates
from thu various precincts to put a
county ticket in the Held:
Tucumcari, August H, 1010
Mr. A. I). Goldenbcrg,
County Chairman of the
Hepublican party, Tucumcari.
Dear sir:
I bee; to inform you, as chairman of
the Quay County Hepublican Central
Committee, that it is my purpo.se to
resign and withdraw my allegiance
from the Hepublican party and be
come a party Prohibitionist, and 1
shnll immediately align myself with
the National Prohibition party.
It is with sincere regret that I with
draw from the Hepublican party and
from the very pleasant associations
that I have had withjtti.e local organ
izations of that party. I have felt
for some lime that my interest in pro
hibition wns paramount to my party
interest as a Hepublican, and 1 feel
that the question of prohibition is the
greatest question before the Ameri
can people today. I recognize that thu
Prohibitionists are taking advance
ground and that it will probably be
several years before National Prohi
bition is an accomplished fact, but at
the same time I feel that National
Prohibition is inevitable and that the
work of the Prohibition party, togeth
er with the many other forces working
for National Prohibition, wi'l ulti
mately force that question to the con
sideration of all political parties.
I want especially to thank the He
publicans of Quny county for the hon
or conferred upon me in their recent
convention of electing me chairman of
that body, with knowledge of my de
clared intention of shortly resigning
from the party. Very truly yours,
iiaijry 11. Mcelroy.

REV. HOERING PREACHES TO
LARGE AUDIENCE IN EL PASO
"It seemed quite like old times again
to preach to a congregation number
ing hundreds instead of dozens," said
suid Rector Hoering, when ho cume up

pool operations. Among those who

Clements' in El Paso last Sunday

rious camps on the border. Having
served two enlistments, and holding
a commission as lieutenant makes the
work among tho soldiers "just like be
ing homo again." Tho response from
the Guardsmen has been most encour

volumes for Uncle Sam's brave boys
that they do not neglect their church

timated that 210,000 bushels of wheat
were tied up in liberal, which repre
sents an investment of about $325,000.
Tho acreage in the Liberal district was
greater this year than ever beforo but
the average of 10 or 12 bushels to the
acre was what they realized, or about
the same averaged in this county.
Mr. Salley on his return to Tucum

higher than last week's prices. Today
he was offering $1.20 and he says the
price will not be apt to decrease un

SOCIALISTS FIRST ENCAMPMENT
Tho socialists of Curry locnl work
ed up the first socialist encampment
ever held in New Mexico. Tho en
campment was held August 3, -I, and
5, at the Conevn Hasin where there
was plenty of good pure water and
shade for many moro people than at
tended. The number attending wns
estimated at 1000 on Friday.
Comrade . C. Thurp of Curry
county, was then; rhuc-dav anil Fri
day and made three stirring speeches.
Comrade Tharp is the first socialist
member of tho New Mexico State leg
islature. His party has nominated
him for re-election. We feel that the
cause of socialism -tho emancipator
of labor has in him a true friend and
an nblo advocate.
Comrade Frost, tho nominee for
superintendent of education in one of
tho counties of Oklahoma, spoke on
Thursday'night. Several enthusiastic
comrades of Quay county spoke dur
ing thu encampment. These speeches
mado us realize the ustness of n co
operative commonwealth, hue tho cli
max was reaches when Comrade Cobb
of Oklahoma City, came in Friday
afternoon.
Mr. Cobb mado three stirring ad
dresses closing witli the subject: "Tho
Evolution of Society." Ho took up
each step society had mado to reach
tho present and showed that social
ism is society's next step and that it
is soon to come to us nnd no force Is
strong enough to prevent It.
Tho local comrades wore so well
pleased that they announced wo would
havo another encampment next Aug.
!lrd, -Uh and 5th, at tho same place
or as near it as possible.

LOCATE
VEIN OF COPPER
E. M. Christian, who has been pros-
.,....)!.,.. t.. ...... U. U.. ..!!!... .. II. .11
liibiuiK 1111 uiu ill inu vicinity ui mill i
Canyon for a number of years, was
! rewarded a few days ago with u suc
cessful location of a vein of copper
thnt is largo and easy of access which
, will test better thnn 10 per cent or
as good as tho best in thu state of New
, Mexico. Mr. Christian was assisting
I in tho Pintado district whero Geo.
1 Murray a mining engineer of sixteen
; years experience, was working and he
' secured his services last Sunday, two
weeks ngo to asnist in locating the
main deposit of copper from which
' it wns evident particles in tho bottom
of the canyon had washed away from.
Murray accompanied Christian to the
camp at Conant spring where he pro
ceeded to view tho surrounding cliffs
, nnd truce the formations from the
bottom of tho canyon to 300 feet up
tho cliff and while killing a big rat
tle snnkc Murray glanced up the cliff
and to his amazement a vein of copper
was exposed which i' is said two men
with picks could have mined two or,
three tons of the substance within five
hours. At the price of copper today
the gross ton as mined from Hull
Canyon would be worth $114.
They say tho vein is about four
feet thick, with talc under tho copper
which contains about two per cent
copper and 3.01 per cent gold. The
mine has been named Legal Tender
nnd a half mile from this is a deposit
of lead whero some of tho old-timers
soy they made bullets with which to
fight the Indinns. Tho article taken
from this location is nearly pure soft
lend and melts with fifteen minutes
so thut it can be shipped in bars. In
dications arc thnt this vein of lead is
strong and in paying quantities.
The now mines will bo 10 miles
from Montoya, about three miles west
of the road to Ima in what everybody
in Quny county knows as Hull Can
yon. Mews. Murray and Christian were
in Tucumcari this week organizing n
stock company. They left Wednesday
for Fort Sumner where they are on
the same mission. They are not out
to graft tho public, but give every
man a chance to go and see for him
self what they hnve found as it will
bear inspection. Ail they need now is
the capital to buy the necessary ma
chinery to mine the product. There
are potash deposit in the canyon suf
ficient to puy the railroud company to
build a stub road out there from Mon
toya and Mr. Christian was working
mainly upon thut phase of the game
when Mr. Murray was given the trail
and located the rich copper deposit.
This means much for that locality
and Quay county providing tho vein
extends back in the cliff us Mr. Mur
ray believes it does. Copper mining
is ono of the most profitable indus
tries of New Mexico and these gen
tlemen aro to be complimented upon
their extremely good luck.
RAINS NOT GENERAL
The excellent rains of Monday and
Tuesday morning in Tucumcari and
east were not very far-reaching west
ward, only a trace being found six
miles out of town.
The season is lengthening well into
the summer nnd still no general rains
have fallen. Crops will be cut short
I in tho dry farming areas and in many
' 'cetions will bo a total loss if rains
do not come soon. Grass in most sec
tions is short and, although stock arc
now in fino condition, moisture must
be forthcoming or rnngo conditions
will be bad for fall and winter.
Good rains hnvo fallon in some sec
tions of tho county, it Is true, but with
out a general rain tho effects are not
the best. It is yet sufficient timo for
good rnins to make grass and save
some of tho crops, but tho tardiness
in tho arrival of tho looked-for and
expected moisture adds fear to all in
terests. Clouds continue to hang low,
the indications aro good for rain nnd
Jupitor PJuvius may open his flood
gates at nny moment.
Tho plains people say they expect
to raise enough row crop to do them
and somo of tho valley fnrmors have
their crops well along but a good gen
eral rain would bo acceptablo even if
somo of those who latoly purchased
uutos had to put their now charges In
tho garago nnd leave them until tho
ronds wero passable Let 'or rain reg
ulur gully-washers, then put tho now
grader to work and fill up tho center
of tho road so thut succeeding rains
will send waters down the sido in
stead of tho roadway.

PROSPECTORS
PICNIC AT PLAIN
On Friday, August A, there gathered
at Plain quite a crowd of local farm
ers and stockmen; also some few from
a distance, to enjoy a picnic. It eems
that it was intended by those in charge
to have something to entertain the
crowd before noon, but for some 1 en
son was postponed. Also thcro wns to
be some speaking, but the speakor.1
failed to show up Tho program com
mittee consisting of Messrs Page, Lind
say, Snelson, appointed H. E. DcOli
viera director of tho program nnd af
ter dinner, it was as follows:
Goat roping contest with tho follow
ing participating: Roy, Best, Bryan
Gholson, Amos Yates, II. E. DcOli
viera and Tom Wright. Bryan Ghol
son won first money my roping and
tying his gont in 25 seconds; Amos
Yates second in 20 seconds, Roy Best
third in 20. H. E. DcOlivicrn nnd Tom
Wright had hard luck and failed to
catch their goats.
Goatroping was new to many pres
ent and seemed to nmuse everybody.
Messrs. Griggs, Hutchison and Hnwk
acted as judges.
Tho next on the program was a ball
game between Frio and Grady, re
sulting in Frio winning. The Bcore
being ! to 10. Tho Frio boys appar
ently had their rivals a shade outclass
ed and outlucked.
Next cowboy's horse race was run,
Vi mile, by tho following: Bryan
Golson, Arnold Walthers, Amos Yates
and II. E. DeOliviera. The result was
Arnold Walthers 1st, Amos Yates 2nd,
Bryan Golson 3rd and H. E. DeOliviera
also ran.
The next nnd last event of tho day
was the somewhat sensational riding
of Tom Wright, who rode till his sad
dlo slipped over tho head of what
seemed an old fnmlly work mulo In
harness, but acted moro llko a dis
guised outlaw when Wright mounted.
The mule did some high jumping and
a wholclot of it but its rider stayed
almost as long as his saddle. The
mulo slipped tho saddle off over Its
hend and forelegs and some one caught
the bridle reins, it then slipped the
bridle all". Some one humorously re
marked that that was the first mulo
they ever saw that unsaddled and un
bridled itself. Wright also rode two
horses but they didn't tango liko the
mule. Ho was tho only rider who
rode for the bronco riding prize.
From the appearance of tho trade
it got, the lone drink stand mil-.; have
been n grand success. Customers were
so numerous thnt they had to wait
their turn to be served und it wns not
always immediately either.
Tho goat roping contest and riding
wero probably the real features of
the day.
BROTHERHOODS ACCEPT ME
DIATION OF U. S. BOARD
New York, Aug. 9. The threaten
ed strike of tho -100,000 railroad em
ployes of tho United States wns avert
ed today when tho railroad brother

New York, Aug. 7. George W. W.
Hanger of tho United States bourd of
mediation nnd conciliation, announced
today that as a result of a conference
between representatives of the Switch
men's Union of North Amorica nnd
the railroads, both sides had agreed

P. H. Snnford came in from South
Missouri Tuesday to visit his brother

WILL ROLD COWBOY'S
L
A number of citizens met at the
Commercial Club rooms Monday night
for the purpose of talking over a prop
osition to hold a Cattlemen's Cowboy
Carnival sometime this fall, perhupg
about tho middle of October. Numer
ous suggestions wore made and an
other meeting was called for Thurs
day night when committees will bo ap
pointed to start work, advertising, so
liciting and arranging for special at
tractions, such as a carnival company
with a band, horse-racing and bronc
busting together with everything else
that goes to make up u uucccsaful
three days' entertainment. It ia pro
posed to hold a barbecue in connec
tion. One day democratic speakers
could address the crowd; thu next day
the Republicans and tho next tho Pro
hibitionists or Socialists could enter
tain tho crowds during tho morning
hours. As soon as tho entertainment
committee is ready to report, tho pro
grams will be printed and distributed.
This will be moro than a statewide
affair as those who aro boosting it Buy
they will bring peoplo here from Kan
sas, Oklnhomu, Texas and Colorado.
Tho railroads will be asked to make
special rates. Extensivo advertising
preparations are being mado and ev
ery dollar that can bo secured will be
spent on attractions worth traveling
many miles to witness.
This movement was conceived by
Henry J. Wofford when a prominent
cattleman offered to head the list with
a cash donation of $50.00 and furnish
a string of horses and riders to as
sist in furnishing amusements.
All the attractions will be at the
base bull park whero the carnival will
also be located. Concessions for lemon
ade, lunch counters and other eating
and drinking resorts will bo sold to
responsible parties. This ia only tho
beginning of what promises to be an
annual occurrenco and Tucumcari may
as well entertain as bo entertained.
Railroads enter this city from nil di
rection end auto roads will allow those
to come from tho south ns well as from
points along tho railroads.
Every citizen of Tucumcari and of
Quuy county should bo interested in
holding three days of amusement and
recreation, forget the dally routine
and como prepared to stay a week if
necessary. There aro a number of
now residents of Quay county who
have never seen a round-up, stampede
or cowboy reunion. It is proposed to
combine nil theso and then havo a
good carnival company hero to make
things still moro lively.
SWIMMING POOL MAKING
GREAT HEADWAY
Tho Rev. Mr. Hoering came up from
El Paso, where ho Is spending August
to superintend tho construction of tho
Boy Scouts' Swimming pool, which will
bo ready for tho opening ceremony,
it is hoped, by tho middle of next week.
Mr. Hoering measured tho Swim
ming Tank at tho El Paso Y. M. C. A.
and found that tho Tucumcari tank
which is located on tho grounds of tho
Episcopal church, just across from
tho St. Michael's Tennis Club, is very
little, if any, smaller than tho El Paw
tank. The deep end will contain about
seven feet, and tho shallow end about
four feet of water. Thoso who feel
they need a greater depth than this
aro recommended to try tho middle
of tho ocean. Tho Scouts expect to
open tho pool to tho public for a emal
admission fee.
An interesting program for tho op
ening ceremony is being arranged,
when thoro will bo a Life Saving Ex
hibition nnd swimming races, diving
contests, etc. Tho dedication cere
mony will be performed by tho mayor,
and tho rector of St, Michael's who
is also president of tho Athletic and
Tennis club,
J. A. JONES BEAT UP
J. A. Jones, who lives somo 18 miles
southeast of Cuervo, haa fifteen cuts
in his scalp, said to havo been inflicted
by a stono in tho hands of his neigh
bor, Mr. Longacre. Tho difficulty oc
curred about 10 or 11 o'clock Tuosday.
Mr. Jones was crossing Mr. Longacre's
son's placo. Jones was carried homo
by tho young Longacre in an uncon
scious condition. Dr. Sanford was
summoned and administered to Mr.
Jones. It is thought that a difference
of long standing, over a fence, was
tho cause of the trouble.
Officers went to the sccno of tho
trouble but returned without fllnding
Longacro. It is supposed that Long
acre left his victim for dead and has
skipped the country. Cuervo Clipper,
