only candidate absent from th<
meeting was E C L Adams, an aspir

dies, heard the canaiaaies. mi
meeting was rather tame and order
ly. Exceedingly tame compared wit!
previous State campaign meeting!
in that it was practically free fron
mud-slinging and abusive epithets.
The candidates were all well re
ceived and given an attentive hear
ing. Governor Manning was greetec
with hearty and prolonged applaus<
and easily held first place in the re

was largely "in the minority in his |
efforts," he having fought bitterly |
compulsory school attendance legisl
lation and child labor laws, and had
been instrumental in killing many
^ worthless bills. He believed that not

constituents by helping to kill bills
rather than hv makinsr new l^s.
In replying to the debate by Mr
Wightman, Mr W Banks Dove, who
is also an aspirant for the office of
Secretary of State,told the audience
&
j that he had been chief clerk in the
office for eight years and prided himself
on being familiar with the laws
governing the various corporations
j of the State. Mr Dove told of the
work he is doing along educational
lines in the mill district of the capital
city.
FOR STATE TREASURER.
Mr D W McLaurin, candidate for
' State Treasurer, accused Mr Carter,
present incumbent, of drawing up*
wards of a $5,000 annual salary and
at the same time educating his
1 daughter at Winthrop college under
the charity provision, and said that
Clemson graduates,who put Mr Carter
in office,were now forsaking him.
He told the voters to work through
j the Legislature for better pensions
for Confederate veterans and veter*
ans' widows. Mr McLaurin referred
IU IIJ9 wai lu^tu.
Mr S T Carter, offering for re-election
to the office of State Treasurer.
in replying to his opponent, said
he had no war record to play on the
j sentiment of the peopie to gain their
votes. He should not be blamed for
' this, he pleaded, in that he was not
born until six years after the war.
Apparently his record as State Treasurer,
he said,has been satisfactory to
everyone except his opponent, who
had tried every means to induce others
to enter the field,and had offered
to pay the expenses of one man if he
' would come out for the office.
FOR RAILROAD COMMISSIONER.
Mr James Cansler, candidate for
' i Railroad Commissioner, said that he
i is crippled in the leg, while his "unidergrowth"
opposition is crippled in
? i the head. Mr Albert S Fant asked
that the test of Thomes Jefferson be
i applied when casting ballots for the
'.office of Railroad Commissioner: "Is

this test be applied to himself. A
G McDuffie Hampton asked for su
port upon his qualification as a cr
engineer and because of experien
in the office. He particularly stresa
his work in compelling railroads

Mr W T Thrower said he came b
fore the people with the endors
ment of Chesterfield county, ai
that he is the only candidate for tl
office east of Columbia.
FOR GOVERNOR.
Governor Manning was the fir
speaker of the candidates for Go
ernor. The Chief Executive said I
sympathized with the flood sufferei
and assured his hearers that he wou
sound a general appeal for contrib
tions to relieve these victims.
The Governor reviewed the la
lcoe oftnHiHnns confronting him tv
years ago, when liquor was open
and brazenly sold, (he laws trampli

true bills, convictions and pleas
guilty in Charleston to charges

stressed the sympathetic and hear
accord in which his office and tl
Legislature worked, the welfare
the State always being at stake. ft
Manning also told the story of tl
revolution of the State hospital f
the insane, it being converted into
hospital for the sick instead of an i
stitution for the reception of crirr
nals.

as false the statement made by Jol
T Duncan, Esq, at Monck's Corm
that Blease had said in the Piedmoi
he would cut the meetings in the lo
counties, where they raised "on
niggers and alligators." Any mt
who made such a statement, he sai
was "a common, every-day liar."
Though bitterly characterizing }/
Manning's administration as "tl
most lawless since 1876," he bo;
eloquent tribute to the Governor
uncompromising zeal for law e:

the Governor of compromising lav
cheating useless offices and commi
sions. The former Governor also a
tacked the chairman of the tax con
mission, "who pays only $1 poll t?
and Abbeville county should pay 81
of that back." In contradiction <
his usual policy of being Goyernor<
his "friends only," the late incun
bent says h<* "p eposes to be tl
Governor of aii the people."
R A Cooper, Esq, wanted it di
tinctly understood that if elected 1
would not abuse the pardon pow<

absolutely that a mistake has be
made." Mr Cooper pleaded for s
intensive development of agricu
ture, pointing out that last yei
South Carolina imported six millic
pounds of butter. He wanted to I
Governor if he could win it fairl
and honestly. "If elected, I'll n<
ask how you voted. Any man wh
tries to be the Governor of a factic

Governor of anyone. Think of o;
past history!"

he Mr J M DesChamps said his mot

at and if his kinsfolk were remove

p- trees and the earth. Mr DesCham
ril also explained he obtained the so
ce briquet of "barnyard" candidate 1
ed mimicking the calls of the barnya
to fowls, which proved to be a deiigr
ig ful diversion each day from the cc
it* vention's routine of debate and pt

had been in the race but two days

- GOVERNOR MANNING CALLS ON
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE
TO CONTRIBUTE.
I Columbia, August 6:?Governor
Manning tonight issued an appeal to
| the people of the State to contribute
i to the fund for the relief of the
) flood sufferers. Governor Manning
J has during the past week made a
5 personal investigation of the situation
in the lower counties, and he
has received accurate information as
> to conditions in other sections of the
State.
| "The crops over a vast area in our
' State have been completely destroyed,"
said the Governor, "and thous'
ands of our people are wholly without
crops, without occupation and
' ?-11 ? Kr>aa/t nnlaoa

' immediate help is given them.
1 "The Federal Government has
' made an investigation through the
army engineers and the Government
has asked me to receive subscriptions
I to supplement the Federal appropriation,
which will not be sufficient to
relieye the suffering. I have already 1
' received some voluntary contribu'
tions, and those who wish to give
may send the money direct to my
"?office in Columbia, and committees
will be appointed to take charge of
C the worK of distribution. Promptness
is essential. Thousands of acres
of crops have been laid waste in
York, Chester, Kershaw, Clarendon,
Williamsburg, Florence, lower Mar
ion, Calhoun and other counties.
The destruction is widespread and
r want is urgent.
r "I cannot too strongly emphasize
; the necessity for prompt and generi
ous response to this appeal on the
) part of our people who have been so
fortunate as not to have suffered
from the effects of the floods."
