through mediation, a country-wide
strike to enforce the employes' de

face," said G. W. G. Hanger, one of
the three, members of the mediation

WOULD BETTER
STATE LAW ON
COMPENSATION
Central Labor Union Parti
cipates in Movement With
State Federation. .
WANT VOCATIONAL
DISEASES COVERED
Would Revise Measure to
Heal Defect Disclosed in
, Recent Case.
Changes In the Compensation Act so
that it will be made perfectly clear
the law is meant to cover so-called
vocational diseases, will be urged in
the next session of the state legisla
ture by the Connecticut Federation of
Labor. . '
At the meeting of the Central Labor
union last evening, the principal topic
of discussion was the Compensation
Act and the change that is deemed
necessary by- the workingmen. The
members considered the recent de
cision of the supreme court of Con
necticut in a New Haven county case,
in which it decided that a man who
had acquired disease from working at
his trade, was not entitled to compen
sation. . '
Commissioner George E. Beers of
New Haven had decided the employe
was entitled to compensation. The
insurance company for the manufac
turing concern appealed to the courts.
The lower court sustained Commis
sioner Beers' decision. -An appeal was
made to the supreme court and that
tribunal, on a split vlte, reversed the
commissioner's judgment.
Labor men point out that when the
law was framed through the efforts of
tho trade unions, it was understood
vocational diseases were covered by
Its provisions.- In order that there
will be no doubt about it, a change
will be advocated because this fea
ture is considered highly Important.
Delegates from' ." many Bridgeport
unions will attend the State Federa
tion convention, which will be. held
Sept. 4,' in Hartford. : It : is expected
to be the largest ever held. f '
The Central Labor union will be
represented prominently.' and the
Bridgepore delegates will take active
interest in the Compensation Act dis
cussion because it is vital to Bridge
port as an industrial city.
At the meeting last night another
subject of discussion was the lack of
enforcement of the law concerning
the protection of bakers . while at
work. It is said there are innumera
ble violations of this, which will be
talked over at the state convention.
It is likely the State Federation will
seek to have a measure adopted pro
viding for establishment of J1.000 as
the bond required of jitney owners.
STRATFORD AVE.
IMPASSIBLE NEXT
MONDAY MORNING
Yellow Mill Draw Will Be
Open for Dredging Opera
, tions Four Hours.
Persons living in the East End or
other sections who come to business
using Stratford avenue must do so
before 8 o'clock Monday morning.
After that hour the. Yellow Mill
bridge will be opened and the passage
of the pond at this point closed to all
traffic' until 12 o'clock noon The
bridge must be kept open, during these
hours in order that the .Martime
Dredging Co. of Syracuse, N. Y., may
complete the' dredging work in the
channels and about the piers of the
bridge. This work is being paid for
by the U. 8. government appropria
tion. 1 - .
It was first planned to have the
work done from Saturday night to
early Sunday morning. To work at
night would mean more expense to
the contractor as his men receive dou
ble time for night work. As his con
tract was made at day working prices,
he refused to do the work except in
the day time. : '
This means that the bridge there
will be closed' to all travel for four
hours in 'the forenoon of Monday.
Paradise Green and other cars now
using Stratford avenue will be routed
over the Barnum avenue line over
Congress street bridge to the center
of the city. The Seaview avenue ser
vice will of necessity be discontinued
during the hours mentioned. There
will be no provision for vehicular or
foot travel across thep ond at that
period. '
Toole & Sunderlln are at present
repairing the pile work and the foun
dations of the bridge, $8,000 having
recently been appropriated by the city
for the work. The war department
now requires that all municipalities
dredge channels and the waters about
the racks for the draws. The city
will have to pay for this work about
the new Stratford avenue, East Wash
ington avenue', and Grand street
bridges. '

pairs and for - mudguards furnished

Jersey City, Aug. lj. A drawing of
what was at first believed to be a sub
marine and which later was admitted
by the designer to be a "self-propel
ling torpedo" together with an envel
ope addressed to John D. Rockefeller
and a notebook containing the name
and address of President Wilson, were
found today among he effects of 1- -
ling Iverson, who, with Axel Larsen,
were arrested yesterday on suspicion
of complicity in the disastrous muni
tions explosions on Black Tom Island
two weeks ago .
Although the two men produced per
sons who t"ld the authorities that they
were with them in another part of the
city at the time of the explosion, the
pair were held in $1,000 bail pending
.an investigation into their history by
police and government officials.
The drawing which showed the tor
pedo design bore the inscription, "Ap
proved by Captain J. Howard, chief of
the United States submarine depart
ment, June 26, 1916.' There was also
a notation, "To be built by Iversoh &
Company, London,'' and another,
"Revolutions 150 miles an hour. For
U. S." .
Iverson told, the authorities 'hat the
dra-i 'ng of the torpedo was his and
that he planned and designed it. He
refused to disclose his reason for the
design, but said that "Iverson & Com
pany" referred to himself. On the re
verse side of the draw ng was the
pictutre of a woman's head, , with an
inscription.

Doy tonlgJi-t. Iverson said it was a
pictutre he had drawn of his mother.
Underneath the heading "President
Wilson" is nls notebook appeared a
meaningless paragraph which Iverson
said he wrote '"to amuse himself."
Letters found among Iverson's effects
contained disconnected phrases, which
the. authorities thought might have
been written In code. One letter, which
Iverson wrote .to his mother and dtaH
not post,- told of "the fright he got
when Black Tom blejv up," and said
there were still eight cars of ammu
