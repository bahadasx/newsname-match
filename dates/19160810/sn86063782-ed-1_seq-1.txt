FEDERAL FARM LOAN
BOARD MEETING
Forty Cities to Be Considered for
Banks?May Be Next Spring Be"
fore Loans Can Be Secured.
Washington, Aug. 7.?The new fed- '
eral farm loan board met for the first
time heee today to work out plans
for a land bauk credit system as provlded
for the get of congress creating (
the board. I * 1
The first'"ork of the board, after |'
effecting organization, will be to U- '
ride the United States into 12 federal <
land bank districts. Before this is <
done, the board probably will hold I
hearings in various parts of the coun- i
. try to ascertain the views of farmers 1
on. the question. I
Forty cities have either applied or i
been recommended for banks, includ- <
~ 1 VflHrila \V?F- <
ing many f?ouiutrru auu iiuuwv ..? ,
ern cities. It is exxpected the claims j
of these and other cities will be pre- j
sented daring the hearings.
- Secretary MeAdoo, ex-offiico mem- i
ber of the farm loan board, who will <
be at the head of the system, predicts j
that it can not be in operation for at j
least six months and probably loans |
can not be made before next spring.
To Aid the Farmer.
In operatiion the system to some
extent will do for the farmer what
the federal reserve system does for
the business man. The fanner will
be givn opportunity to secure money
on his most available commodity, his '
land, just as the merchant and manu- '
factnrer has been enabled through the 1
federal reserve system to have his '
paper, based on commercial transactions,
find a ready market. \
L The new scheme has many points
of resemblance to the federal resen'e (
EV' system, hut in many essential fea- ,
tures it is entirely different In no ,
, way will the banks created under it j
Mmmordni hankine. and while it ,
f is possible that in years to come they
Bj?:- may have funds to loan that will
K amount to several hundred million
^ dollars, it is not believed probable '
K that the system evr will have the
l;-B& resources of the reserve system.
t Bow Loan WiU Be Made.
The bauv' will not, except in speloanassoci^
be S
ganlzed to any unmber in land bank
pective owners of farm land who depective
owners of farm lands property.
Applications for charters for
these associations must go up to the
farm loan board and may be refused
by it. No association will be chartered
unless it is shown that signing
members desire loans totaling at least
$20,000.
i In applying for membership in an
association, a farmer must take 5 per
cent of the face value of the desired
loan in stock of the association.
Land Value Main Consideration.
Applications for loans are to be
passed upon by a loan committee of
the farm loan association. Loans will
be made only on first mortages or
farm property and the value of the
land will be the main consideration.
The land will be subjject to Inspection
by an appraiser of the farm loan
. board. Loans will l>e made only for
purchase of land, foor its improvement.
or for purchase of livestock,
equipment, fertilizers, or to provide
buildings on a farm or to liqidate
Indebtedness existing when the first
association is formed in the county
where land is located.
No loo' u will be made of more than
$10,000 nor less than $100. Interest
will not be charged greater than 6 per
cent The loan itself will be reduced
throughout an amorization plan
providing for reduction by annual or
semi-annual payments on the princinfli
Xn mortnirncp shall run for more
than 40 years no less thain fiive. and
there are the necessary provisions in
the law for satisfaction of overdue interest
or amortization payments.
Bank Directorates.
In the beginning the fedeal land
hanks will be governed by directors
appointed by the farm loan board, but
after subscriptions from loan associations
to any federal land bank's capital
stock reach $100,000. an elective
system will become effective, with
three directors chosen by the board
nnd six by the lean associations. The i
board will approve comi?ensation paid
directors and officers of these bans.
The loan associations will l?e directed
by unpaid oF'eers expect a secretary
and treasure.*, or secretary-treasurer.
Banks and Ion associations will be
subject to tin- customeary examination
by persons appointed by the farm loan
\ board and the law provides penalties
for infringements of its provisions or
counterfeiting of farm loan bonds.

TRADE CONTINUES TO FORGE h
AHEAD I
Despite Modification in Crop Reports,
Tide of Prosperity Moves at Great
Rate.
New York, Aug. 6.?Duu's Review
"Exceptionally gratifying reports regarding
trade, industry and transpor- 1
tation are somewhat modified by less i
favorable news from the agricultural
regions. Yet the reduced crop estiiency
toward wholesome conservatism,
have not raised doubts as to the
maintenance of the forward movement
In business. Iu spite of various
Jrawbacks and uncertainties, confllence
in sustained economic progress
is undiminished, the large increase in
new enterprises testifying to strong
faith in the future. Notwithstanding
the magnitude \-l previous purchases,
mauy interests are disposed to extend
commitments further, being prompted ^
to cover for dl annt needs by fears of
a growing scarcity or supplies- ana tue
possibility :{nit prices may go still
higher. Recoveries t hare occured in
certain lines that recently showed evi- ?
Jenees of react in, such as in steel and
in dry goods, while additional advances ^
appear in commodities which thus far f
have given no sign*' of yielding. WeekIv

the South. 8
SOIL SELECTION.?The Late i>o- 1
tato thrives in a wide range of soil 't
types. In Laurens County, S. C., a
crop produced an average of 200 bushels
on red clay loam soil, following a *
grain qrop. In Robeson and Blladen
Counties, N. C., growers hari^advised
that very satisfactory cropaqMfe grown
on Norfolk sandy loam sdll. The best
poll for the fall Irish Potato wtould be
.sandy loam soil through prepared and
in which there is corporated a libberal
supply of organic matter. Select If
possible au upland bottom. These
spots always contain more moisture
than the higher places.
jv?ra?r "wrtrany^planted
lin the late potato crop. As soon as
(grain has beeu cut, broadcast peas and
plow in. In the later part of July plow
in i>eas with disk or turn plow. Then
cut the land in two directions with disk
harrow. Let stand for a few days and
ithen broadcast lot scrapings or stable
manure or leaf mold and plow in broadcast
with turn plow or disk plow, immediately
following with disk harrow
(or section harrow. This leaves the
land in excellent condition.
Planting may be done immediately
following the above preparation or
wait a few days before planting. The
proper time for planting this late crop
(is July 20th to August 10th. A 10 inch
shovel or a middle burster is used to
lay off rows at distance of three feet
apart.
i
In bottom of this furrow put down
800 to 1,000 pounds of fertilizer mixed
as follows: 800?1,000 pounds tankage.
800?1,000 pounds 16% Acid. 100 lbs
Nitrate Soda. Cotton seed meal and '
Acid Pliospate mixed in equal parts
may be used to advantage. When
fertilizer has been applied in bottoms
of furrow, run bull tongue or small
shovel in row to thoroughly mix fertilizer
with soil. |
Attention is called to the importance
of cutting jKitatoes in medium large |
sizes in order that dry weather will i
/not dry out the potato and reduce its 1
vitality. After cutting pq|tatoes, tt> <
prevent drying out and attack of dis- <
leases, it is advisable to roll pieces in
agricultural or well slaked lime. Drop J
potatoes eight to twelve inches apart *
and cover with two furrows. This '
leaves the potato covered about five or 1
six inches deep and a bed rounded '
slightly above level.
LATE VARIETIES.?It has found in |
a number of instances that it is hard |
to get a stand from varieties other
?han look kkot Mountain, Green Montain,
or Peach Blow. I
ui'Miiui Allium i n iii i? n lan yuneij
ifavored in many sections. Big yielder j
land sells well throughout the East and <
South as a winter potato. <
CJreen Mountain is smooth, large pro- *
ducing, fall variety. However, it is 1
not as large potato as the Lookout J
:Montaain. !
Peach Blow variety is planted exclusively
in some sections of the Soth 1
as a late potato. Markekt is always '
good for this potato.
