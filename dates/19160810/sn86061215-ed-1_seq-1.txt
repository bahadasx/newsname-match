German Headquarters (via Berlin),
Tuesday, Aug. 8—Since yesterady the
famous old French city of Peronne has
been under French artillery Are, re
sulting in a great conflagration which
threatens to wipe it out. Already the
fine collection of paintings of Italian
and Flemish masters has been des
troyed by shells which landed square
ly in the city hall, where the most
valuable art objects from the museum
had been housed for protection.
In addition the shells destroyed un
replaceable collections of medieval
Germanic silver and semiprecious
stone work, Celtic coins dating? from
the time of the Roman invasion and
medallions. Houses in some streets

WILSON NAMES
AMERICANS FOR
BIG CONFERENCE
SECRETARY LANE AND JUDGE
BRANDEI8 AND ANOTHER TO
MEET MEXICANS.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 9. —Secre
tary Lane of the Interior department
and Associate Justice Brandeis of the
supreme court have been selected as
two of the three American members of
the joint commission which will under
take settlement of Mexican border
difficulties. The name of the third
member will be made public later.
Formal announcement of the ap
pointment of the commission was de
layed today only to wait acceptance
from the third man asked by President
Wilson to serve. The Mexican mem
bers already ha,ve been designated and
Eliseo Arredondo, Gen. Carranza's am
bassador designate, has been author
ized to arrange with Acting Secretary
Polk details as to time and place of
meeting.
Mr. Arredondo called at the state
department during the day and gave
further assurances of the willingness
of the de facto government to have the
scope of the commission's discussions
as broad as the United States desires.
It is regarded as probable that the
meetings will be held at some resort
on the New Jersey coast..
Carranza In Accord.
Today's announcement followed a
brief conference between Mr. Polk awl
Eliseo Arredondo, Carranza's ambas
sador designate. Final assurance was
given by Mr. Arredondo that Gen. Car
ranza was in complete accord with
suggestions of the Washington gov
ernment that in the discussions the
commissioners be given the broadest
possible scope.
As it begins its task the commission
will be required first to reach some
conclusion on the specific points out
lined by Gen. Carranza in his original
proposal. The first subject under this
view would be the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico, to be
followed by negotiations of a proto
col covering future military operations
along the border.
State department officials said It
was not necessary for all matters to
be worked out before recommenda
tions could be submitted for ratifica
tions. On the other hand, it was re
garded as possible that each agree
ment reached by the commission
would be reported and acted upon byj
the two governments separately.
BANDITS ATTACK TRAIN.
Chihuahua, Mexico, Aug. 9.—Villa
bandits yesterday attacked a passen
ger train on the Torreon and Durango
railroad at Noria. They were repulsed

Gen. Francisco Murgia's staff was
killed. The bandits, numbering about
twenty, scattered to the foot hills.
CAVALRY LACKS HORSES.
Brownsville, Tex., Aug. 9. —Minus
several hundred of its troopers, unable
to participate because there are not
enough horses to go around, the first
Illinois cavalry took part in a review
before Gen. James E. Parker, comman
der of the Brownsville district, today.
FIVE MILLION IN
EUROPE'S PRISONS
New York, Aug. 9.—More than
5,000,000 prisoners, double the num
ber of men engaged in any previous
war that the world has known, are
now confined in prison camps of the
belligerent nations, according to Dr.
John B. Mott, general secretary of the
international committee of the Young
Men's Christian association, who
arrived here today on the Danish
steamship Oscar II, from Copenhagen.
Dr. Mott left here in May for Russia
and has visited the prison camps of
nearly all the countries at war.
Dr. Mott said that of the prisoners,
Germany has the greatest number,
approximately 1,750,000. Russia, with
about 1,500,000, comes next, then Aus
tria with 1,000,000, followed in order
by France, Italy, Great Britain and
Turkey. Russia's prisoners he added,
are rapidly increasing, more than
400,000 having been added to the
camps since the beginning of the last
Russian drive. In six weeks, Dr. Mott
added, 230,000 passed through Kiev.
GERARD TO CALL ON
RULER OF GERMANY
Ixmdon, Aug. 9.—"Berlin telegrams
state that the American ambassador,
James °W. Gerard, asked an audience
of Emperor William in order to hand
him an autograph letter from Presi
dent Wilson, in which the president
outlines his wishes concerning the
feeding of the population of Poland,"
the Amsterdam correspondent of the
Exchange Telegraph Co. wired today.
"The letter is believed to be of high
political importance though no men
tion is made of an offer of peace medi
ation.
"Ambassador Gerard probably will
join the emperor at the western head
quarters."

Decision Contradicts Early
Statement Declining to
Employ Mediators
CHANCE OF STRIKE
OFF FOR A TIME
Federal Board's Appeal to
Trainmen Does Not Fall
Upon Deaf Ears
New York, Aug. 9.—The threat
ened strike of the 400,000 railway
employes of the United States was
averted today when the railroad
brotherhoods accepted a proffer of
the U. 3. board of mediation and
conciliation to mediate their dif
ferences with the railroads.
Announcement of the accep
tance of the offer was made by
A. B. Garretson, head of the con
ductors' brotherhood, after It had
been delivered by G. W. W. Hang
er, member of the board, following
an appeal to that body to inter
vene made today by the national
conference of railroad managers.
Mr. Garretson said he had in
formed the board that the offer
was accepted on the condition that
"its good offices are promptly ex
ercised."
The federal board, which is com
posed of Mr. Hanger, Martin A.
Knapp and Judge W. L. Chambers
was prepared to begin conferences
with the respective sidea to the
controversy before night, it was
understood, although atjthe time
of Mr. Garretson's announcement
the board had not been officially
Informed of the acceptance.
New York, Aug. 9. —The national
conference bf railroad managers today
again rejected the demands of the four
railroad brotherhoods for an eight
hour day and time and a half for
overtime and proposed submission of
their differences with the men to the
United States board of mediation and
conciliation.
This proposal, A. B. Garretson in be
half of the brotherhoods rejected.
Elisha Lee, chairman of the railroad
conference, in proposing that their dif
ferences be mediated by the federal
board, said the brotherhoods had pre
viously declined arbitration under the
Newlands act, providing for six arbi
trators, but that the railroads saw no
other way out of their difficulties than
through mediation.
Afraid of Arbitration.
Mr. Garretson, reiterating the con
tention of the brotherhoods that in
previous attempts to settle differences
with the railroads through the federal
boards, the brotherhoods had failed to
obtain satisfactory awards, said that
the unions believed they could reach
a settlement by dealing directly with
the roads.
Chairman Lee then announced that
he would nevertheless appeal to the
federal board of mediation and concil
iation. This board was at the time in
session at a nearby hotel.
Mr. Lee's announcement came after
Mr. Garretson had expressed his will
ingness to have the railroads make the
appeal. In that event, he said, the
unions could make a reply as to their
attitude to the federal board.
This reply, Mr. Garretson indicated,
after adjournment of the meeting,
would probably be favorable.
Mediators Ready to Act.
Judge W. L. Chambers, chairman of
the U. S. board of mediation and con
ciliation, announced after the adjourn
ment of the meeting that the railroads
had formally appealed to the board to
mediate "their differences with the
unions.
The board immediately prepared a
communication to the brotherhoods of
fering its services which it was an
nounced would be dispatched to the
brotherhood chiefs at once.
Meantime, it was stated,
vthe
board
would remain in session to await the
brotherhood's reply.
It was indicated by members of the
board that the communication was be
ing sent on the assumption that the
brotherhoods would accept their offer.
A reply was expected before 1 o'clock
today, it was said.
Both sides, after adjournment, went
into executive session.
BREMEN EXPECTED

New London, Conn., Aug. 9.—The
German submarine Bremen is expect

PLEASES CHICAGOANS.
Chicago, Aug. 9.—Declaring that he
didn't care the snap of his finger what
might happen to him politically or
personally afterward, and that if elec
ted president he would conduct this
national government for the American
people regardless of partisianshlp,
Charles E. Hughes last night brought
15,000 persons to their feet In the
great Coliseum meeting. He had been
in Chicago all day, and everywhere
he appeared In public he was greeted
with great enthusiasm.
Speaking at night in the same hall
In which he was nominated, Mr.
Hughes Bald )ie felt a special obligar
tion to tell the people of Chicago pre-*
cisely where he stands.
Policies of Construction.
He then elucidated the "America
efficient" doctrine set forth briefly in
his speech flf acceptance, and an
nounced for the first time Blnce his
nomination the specific constructive
policies he would support.
Following are excerpts from his
speech:
If I had to choose between a gov
ernment with 75 per cent laws, and
25 per cent honest administration, or
a government with 25 per cent laws
and 75 per cent honest and efficient
administration, I would take the lat
ter every time.
If I am elected president of the
United States I propose that every
man that I put in charge of an im
portant department shall be a man
eminently fit to discharge the duties
of that department.
Now, I am a lawyer but I have
grown up alongside of business men,
and I have respect for facts. I do
not want any hot air in mine.
It is easy for democracy to lavish
its favors and to take little account
of the future. The hard thing for
democracy is to be expert, to count
the cost, to look into the future, and
wisely plan.
But we won't have any more, if I
can stop it, of these "kiss me and I'll
kiss you" appropriations in congress.
We have a financial system in the
United States that would not be tol
erated in any corporation In Chicago.
Instead of having a responsible project
presented by the executive, we have a
helter-skelter, unworthy system of
appropriations which will result In
waste and extravagence just as long
as if is continued.
There is nothing new for me in my
declaration for equal suffrage, al
though it may be new to the country
as coming from me. I have long held
this view and at a time like this you
can't expect me to keep my views to
myself.
OWft'S CORN VALUABLE
Yield In 8tate Is Larger Than Last
While the Nation's Crop Is Very
Much 8maller.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 9.—Though
the corn crop for the United States
appears to be considerably smaller
than the record yield of last year,
Iowa is favored in that its crops will
greatly .exceed last year's. The
bureau of crop estimates computes the
probable yield this year at 365,000,000
bushels, whereas the final estimates
for last year showed returns of 303,
000,000 bushels. Because of the na
tion's crop being smaller corn is worth
more than it was last year, so Iowa
farmers have the advantage of selling
a bigger crop in a higher market. At
the selling price August 1, Iowa's corn
crop is worth about $50,000,00b more
this year than it was last.
Both pastures, potatoes and flax
have suffered damage as the result of
the hot wave, according to the report
The condition of pastures was rated
at 91 per cent, as against 108 per cent
a year ago potatoes rated at 81 per
cent on August 1 last year, were rated
at 102 per cent and flax, rated last
year at 94 per cent, thiB year had fal
len to 90 per cent.

Supervisors and Committee
Will Confer About New
Sanitorium Here
SUNNYSLOPE IDEAL
LOCATION FOR IT
Natural Surroundings Make
It Very Convenient
as an Institution
Working out the details for the
establishment of Wapello county's new
tuberculosis sanitorium at "Sunny
slope," east of the city, now rests with
the central organization committee in
conference with the board of super
visors and representatives of the medi
cal society.
With the deal closed with W. E. Mul
lins, owner of the place Tuesday after
noon, the supervisors are now turning
to confer with the committee and med
ical society members and further plans
on the proposition will be worked out
within the next few weeks. The cen
tral committee, which was named at
a social service supper here last May
consists of Mayor Fred H. Carter, C.
S. Harper, president of the Commercial
club, and Dr. Murdock Bannister, of
the medical society.
An Ideal Location.
"Sunnyslope' 'is an ideal location for
the sanitorium from every standpoint.
It is located at the crest of a natural
slope and has a beautiful scenic view
from all sides. The hills, covered with
natural foliage, rise to the rear and off
to the front on three sides spreads
the broad valley of the Des Moines
reaching to the crest of the bluffs on
the south side of the river.
The house is an eight room bunga
low type and three porches, sixty-five
by eight feet, almost completely sur
round the "T" shaped building. Out
of each of the eight rooms two French
doors open onto the proches. While
built for a summer home by the late
T. D. Foster it is a substantial all tho
year round dwelling. The owners, who
sold it to the county, Mr. and Mrs. W.
E. Mullins bought the place six years
ago and have lived there, summer and
winter alike, ever since.
Aside from the principal dwelling
there is a four room cabin, in excel
lent shape, on the place. A 300 foot well
supplies water of the very best flavor
and a large cistern augments it for
water Bupply. There is a splendid
wind mill and water tank and under
ground and over ground piping car.
ries the supply to the house. There
is also a gas plant and cess pool, both
in the best of condition.
Wonderful Trees.
There are between twenty and twen
ty-flve varieties of trees on the place.
Many of these are from very .rare
species and were planted by the late
Mr. Foster. Seven acres make up the
amount of land and in addition to the
beautiful lawn trees there is a good
sized fruit orchard well started, a
chicken house and a garage. An im
mense garden tract adds to the prac
tical Idea of the place.
May Increase Land.
Contrary to the general opinion on
such matters statistics gathered by
state specialists show that in a few
years after the establishment of a
tubercular sanitorium in any locality
land values in that vicinity show an in
crease.
This same data shows that people
living in or near such an Institution
are in far less danger of tubercular
Infection than those pursuing the hab
its of their everyday life through the
busy streets of the city.
Convenient Location.
"Sunnyslope" is outside the city
limits and is boasting of a superior
location from the crowded standpoint
yet it Is not far from town. The most
convenient way to reach it is north on
Walnut avenue agd then east on Bis
marck avenue which brings one direct
ly to the rustic entrance to it
