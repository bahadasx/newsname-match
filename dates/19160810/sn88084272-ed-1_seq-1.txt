council Thursday morning and asked
for an investigation of the records of

a period of several years in order that
the apparent shortage in taxes collect

Collector McSain reported that there
were 102 cases of delinquency record
ed in his office but that many respon
sible citizens of 1 Paso had appeared
at the tax collector's office and have
shown receipts for their taxes, the col
lector said. For these receipts pro
duced by the taxpayers, collector Mc
Sain said no record exists in his office
or on any of the tax rolls. McSain de
clared that, while it was impossible to
ascertain exactl the amount of the
apparent shortage, it will amount to
several thousand dollars.

UlSITHITEi
Acceptance of Germany's
Terms Believed Likely; In
demnity Is Problem.
Washington. D. C, Aug. 10 With
the permission of Germany, the United
States is soon to publish the last note
in the Lusitania case which was sub
mitted by German ambassador count
von Bernstorff nearly six months ago.
There has been no Intimation as to the
precise date when the note would be
made public The fact that It is to be
published is believed to indicate the
United States' acceptance of the terms
of the note.
The communication, dated February
16 last, deals only with the principles
involved. It does not mention the
amount of indemnity Germany is to pay
or how or -when the amount will he
agreed upon. It simply "recognizes lia
bility." promises to make reparation
by the payment of indemnity, gives as
surances for the future and declares
that reprisals, such as ruthless subma
rine operations, must not be directed
at other than enemy subjects.
Discussion of AniotintN.
Until now there has been absolutely
no official discussion in regard to the
luestion of indemnity. The German
government Is represented as feeling
that, having signified its willingness to
make reparation, the United States
must make the next move toward se
curing it.
The communication when submitted
b count von Bernstorff was regarded as
being tentative, and the United States
refrained from accepting it because of
the declaration by the central powers
of their intention to treat as warships
armed merchant ships of the entente
allies.
Many Claim Filed.
It has been indicated by offh ials of
the denartment recentlv that it annar-
ently being evident that Germany was
living up to her promises, the Lusitania
note, the wording of which occupied
much of the time of secretary Lansing
and count von Bernstorff oer a period,
of many weeks, should be published.
The Berlin foreign office offered no
objection.
Hundreds of claims for lives and
property loss on the Lusitania are on
file in the state department. Heirs of
victims have filed claims ranging from
$5000 to $1,000,000 each The total of
the claims on file and details regard

; Democratic Party Gives Out
Gompers' Letter Eeview-
mg Hughes' Decisions.
Washington, D C, Aug. 10. In an
apparent effort to make out that for
mer justice Hughes of the supremo
court of the United States is unfriend
ly toward organized labor. Democra
tic party managers have given out a
letter written by president Samuel.
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor to Thomas H. Nichols of Al
liance, Oho. reviewing Mr. Hughes's;
attitude in supreme court cases involv
ing the interests of labor, particularly
the Danbury hatters' case.
Mr. Gompers's letter reviews the
Danbury hatters case which resulted
in an unanimous decision in the su
preme court, in which former Justice
Hughes concurred, holding the hat
ters of Danbury must individually pay
D. E. Loewe and company some $300,
000 damages under the Sherman law
for the celebrated hatters' boycott. It
also referred to the court's decision
holding unconstitutional the Arizona
anti-alien labor law. Former justice
Hughes wrote the opinion.
"In that decision," wrote Mr. Gomp
ers, "justice Hughes took the position
that the injunctive process applies to
personal relations. Mr. Hughes na
taken an unequivocal position. He
endorses the abuse of the writ of in
junction against which wage earners
have vigorously protested and which
they have tried to correct by remedial
legislation in order that they might
enjoy the rights and opportunities of
free citizens.
The above is accurately the Infor
mation which you asked and I take
it will be of importance to you as well
as to the working people and liberty
loving citizens all over the country in
enabling them to understand the men
tal attitude of Mr. Hughes, who now
Is a candidate for the presidency of

Foreign Relations Commit
tee Is Now Passing Judg

Washington, D. C, Aug. 10. The
treaty by which the United States
would acquire the Danish West Indies
for $15,000,00. recently signed by sec
retary of state Lansing and Danish
minister Brun, now Is before the sen
ate foreign relations committee and
probably will be considered early next,

treaty was sent to the senate in execu
tive session Tuesday and referred to
the committee without discussion.
At the request of the Danish foreign
office the terms of the convention are
to be considered confidential until both
governments agree to have them an
nounced. The fact that $25,000,000 is the con
sideration to be paid by the United
States leaked out some time ago, how
ever, and in a general way the nature
of the document has been discussed.

It Is understood that in return for
the cession of the islands of St- Thomas.
St. Croix. St- John and "adjacent Isl

and concessions belonging to the Dan

of the treaty, maintain certain grants,
licenses and concessions granted in
the islands by Denmark, and guarantee

in the ceded territory.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
