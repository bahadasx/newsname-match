Number 35
GLUBSBEST EVER
Six Clubs Represented
Fine Records Made
P; A. Melick High Man
The tournament of Arizona gun
clubs held in Williams last Satur
day was the most successful event
of the kind ever held here. Better
representations of other clubs had
been hoped for," but all . . responded
and sent good men- Dr. P. A.
Melick of Williams was high man
with a' percentage of 97 for the ten
events but H. P. DeMund of Phoe
nix and Ben Wilson of Gallup, N.
? M., were close after him with 96J
and 96 respectively. Of the 27
men participating 11 made 90 or
better and 21 made 80 or better.
Of those snooting the full ten
events the lowest percentage was
75. The record for full events as
shown by the score sheet is on
page five.
The Williams men who shot made
an average percentage of 86. TheRay
Squad of five made an average per
centage of 86. The four Phoenix
men made an average percentage of
95. Of the single men represent
. ing clubs. Bruner of Los Angeles
made a percentage of 81, Wilson of
Gallup made a percentage of 96
and Francis of Flagstaff made a
percentage of 83.
The long runs of 50 or over,
which secure recognition from the
munitions manufacturers jn the
shape of a medal were made by H.
P. and R. DeMund, I. L. Eden and
r D. E. Merrill of Phoenix, W. D.
Finney, F. M. Gold and P? A. Mel
ick of -Williams and - Ben Wilson of
Gallup. j
The local men are very well sat
isfied indeed with the tournament
and think the result justifies the ex
pense and trouble of arranging for
it. The invited clubs sent their
best men as wad natural and prop
er, and carried away honors which
thej' earned by superior shooting.

ONE COMMISSIONER IS
ENOUGH MARICOPA
Say P. J. Miller's Friends
P. J. Miller, candidate for the
democratic nomination for Corpor
ation Commissioner, came to Ari
zona in 1883. He began his Ari
zona life as a miner and made his
way up by hard work. After work
ing for a period in the old Orsoris
silver mine he was employed by
the government during General
Crook' 8 campaign against Geron
imo having charge of transportation
and stores at Whipple barracks.
It was largely thru the activity
of P. J. Miller that the reclam
ation service was brot into Yuma
county. He has been actively in
terested in farming, mining and
general business in Arizona for
many years. He was a member of
the state tax commission 1912 to
1915 and was very active in com
pelling railroads and other corpor
ations to pay their just share of the
taxes. He has served Yuma coun
ty a number of years as clerk of
the Board of Supervisors aud he
has served the city of Yuma as a
member of the common council.
He is at present a member of the
State Board of School Land- Ap
praisers, Mr. Miller has traveled extensive
ly over the State of Arizona and
knows her people and their needs.
His large business and civic ex
perience aud his thoro knowledge
of the people and conditions in
Arizona fit him peculiarly for the
duties of the office of Corporation
Commissioner. .
The friends of Mr. Miller urge
that it would be bad policy on the
part of the voters of Arizona to
give Maricopa county two of the
three Corporation Commissioners.
They believe that the remainder of
the state should have two and they
present the name of P. J. Miller as
that of a-man who will worthily
fill the place to be made vacant by
the retirement of W. P. Geary of
Cochise county.
No need to send your watch
away for repairs. Chas. H. Howe
at the Grand Canyon Drug Store
will put it in first class shape.
Mr. L. E. Human of the
Valley Hardware and Plumbing
Co., Phoenix, and party passed
thru Williams Tuesday on the
road to Pinetop Ariz. Mr.
Human is son-in-law of Hon.
Henry Erds, republican candi
date for congress. The party
had auto trouble and stopped at
the Red Cross garage for re
pairs. BOBBY BURNS HAS
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION
Last Friday night Town Marshal
Bobby Burns took No. 7 for Phoe
nix where he expected an operation
on his head to relieve him of the
pain from which he had been suf
fering for quite a long time. Aug
ust 7th Mr. Burns wired Mr. F. M.
Gold that the operation had been
performed and was highly success
ful and that he was feeling fine and
expected to come home this week.
To appreciate Williams climate
one should visit Phoenix, Marshal
Burns says. It is just awful down
there.
Regular train leaves Williams at
1:30 p. m. returning at 9:30 p. m.
There will also be special auto
mobile service from Williams to

Three Train to Carry Sugar
Five thousand tons of Philippine
sugar recently left San Francisco
in three special Southern Pacific
trains to help fill New York's sweet
tooth. The .consignment is the
biggest ever sent to this country
from the islands and arrived here
on the steamer "Hudson Maru.",
The size of the shipment is due
both to the higher price of sugar
in the East and the market fluc
tutations and at the same time
the movement from the Philippines
direct to New York is a new one
in ocean and railroad freight an
nals. One hundred and twenty
cars were required for the sugar.
