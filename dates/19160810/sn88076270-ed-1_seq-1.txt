HAIL STORMS WORK
GREAT DESTRUCTION
CROPS IN McKENZIE, DIVIDE AND
BOTTINEAU COUNTIES LAID
WASTE
While this county has suffered its
full share of losses from hail in past
years, it has this season so far es
caped. Several other sections of the
state have been less fortunate. The
accounts, received through our ex
changes, of the storms that hit
Divide, Bottineau and McKenzie coun
ties Tuesday and Wednesday nights
of last week tell of much greater
destruction than the first information
indicated. Many other parts of the
state have suffered from recent hail
storms.
The storms followed a northwest by
southeast course and laid waste wide
strips of country. In Divide county
the hailed district is described as from
six to twelve miles wide extending
from the Westby country nearly or
quite across the county, cutting a wide
swath through the splendid country
south of Ambrose and Crosby.
The same storm appears to have
struck again in northern Bottineau
county. The Souris Messenger says:
Hail Wednesday night at Antler,
Kuroki, Westhope, south of Landa
and north of Kramer, completely
wiped out the crop. North and north
east of Souris the crop is half gone.
Tremendous wind accompanied the
hail."
McKenzie County Hit
Late Tuesday evening Northwest
ern McKenzie county suffered heavy
loss from what is perhaps the worst
hail strom that has visited it since
the coming of the homesteaders. Of
this storm the McKenzie County
Journal of Charlson gives the follow
ing account:
By far the worst hail storm that
has ever visited this section of the
county laid waste the grain on at
least a hundred square miles of terri
tory south of here Tuesday evening.
The path of the storm in this coun
ty was from Seneschal southeast and
east to the reservation, a distance of
about twenty, miles, and the zone in
which total losses are reported ap
pears to be about six miles wide. The
north line of total destruction is ap
proximately from a mile two north
of Elidah to about a mile south of
Keene and thence about east, and the:
Jbeavy damage
south as Berg.
This is, of course, a serious set
back for the hundreds of settlers in
the afflicted zone, and therefore to
the community at large. And the
loss was not confined to the fields of
grain. The storm overturned build
ings and horses and cattle were in
jured by being driven into barb-wire
fences. There were also losses due
to lightning.
Tn the Charlson locality there was
a heavy shower of rain with little
wind and no hail worth mentioning.
Of the same storm the Schafer Rec
ord says:
McKenzie county was visited bv its
first destructive hail strom on Tues
day evening about 10 o'clock. The
storm entered the county from the
north and taking a southeasterly
course passed out through the Ber
thold Indian reservation on the east.
Its course was some thirty miles Ion?
and about six miles wide, beginning
at Senechal on the Missouri river on
the north passing through Elidah and
between Berg and Keene. one of
best farming sections in the county,
Between 40 and 50 farmers suffered a
total loss and more than twice this
number suffered a partial loss. Only
a very small per cent of the farmers
whose crops were totally or partially
destroyed carried insurance against
loss by hail.
Fields of heavy grain were cut off
short to the ground by the liail and
have the appearance of having been
cut with a mower. Scarcely a straw
was left lying on the ground in the
path of the storm. The standing
grain seems to have been ground to
bits and carried away by the heavy
wind. The prairie grass was also cut
close to the ground.
Among the number of farmers in
the path of the storm who suffered a
total loss are, S. G. Fadden, H. H.
Swenson, Buhel Bros AfeClure P.ros..

Lightning Causes Bad
Fire At Dickey
Jamestown, N. D., Aug. 5—Fire en
tailing a loss of practically $15,000
occurred at Dickey, thirty miles south
of here Thursday night and was caus
ed by lis-htninsr firing one of the
buildings in the city.
Shortlv after 2 o'clock a bolt struck
the Dr. Virgo drug store setting fire
to the structure. The flames spread
rapidly to other buildings in the line
of the wind.
The Dickey Reporter which was
about to issue its weekly edition, suf
fered a total loss. Among the places
destroyed were:
The barber shop, the postoffice
block, The Reporter newspaper plant
of which H. D. Mack is editor and
publisher, the meat market owned by
A. Mattson, and a residence undergo
ing repairs owned by H. D. Warner of
this city.
Rural Bible Schools
Will Rally Here
There will be a Rally of the Rural
Bible Schools connected with the Con
gregational and Methodist churches,
at Gromatka's Grove, next Sunday af
ternoon, August 13.
Every one who attends the services
at Missouri Ridge, Spring Coulee,
Garden Valley, East Fork and Palmer
School House is invited and urged to
be present. Bring an appetite and a
basket for the picnic dinner at one
o'clock and an open mind and co-oper
ative disposition to the Rally at three.
A good program of music is being
prepared, and talks by county and
state officers of the association, and
the pastors of the congregations will
be given on subjects pertaining to
the problems of the Bible school and
the best ways of handling these prob
lems.
Let everybody plan to come and
make this Rally an inspirational good
time for every one present.
Does Low Birth Rate
Mean Race Suicide?
If the vital statistics as given by
the last bulletin published by the
North Dakota Board of Health, can
be believed, the death rate in Willis
ton during the last three months ex
ceeds the birth date. This is a start
ling condition of affairs, and were it
not for the fact that outsiders are
continually moving into the city, it
would eventually, mean the total ex
tinction of the City of Opportunity.
During the three months reported
the death rate, figured on the basis
of a year, is about 1 per cent while
the birth rate is only 2-3 of 1 per cent.
This is considerably less than the
average mortality of France in time
of peace, and if the death rate con
tinues to increase over the birth rate
at the present speed, Williston must
cease to exist in about 600 or 700
years.
The report for the entire state
shows about three births for every
death, while Williams County shows
three and a fraction births for every
deaths.
It has been suggested that the con
dition existing in Williston may be
due to the high cost of living. Another
explanation for the low comparative
birth rate may be found in the fact
that births are frequently not report
ed to the proper authorities and hence
do not get recorded. Vital statistics
for the months of April, May and
June are as follows:

BUYS OUT "NEW YORK"
R. Rawitscher, proprietor of the
New York Store returned last Satur
day evening from a business trip to
Plentywood. While in that city Mr.
Rawitscher closed a deal for the en
tire stock of the New York Store of
that place, consisting of clothing,
shoes, furnishings, hats, caps, etc. It
will be to the interest of patrons of
this well known clothing house to
watch the announcements as they ap
pear from week to week and take ad
vantage of seasonable merchandise
at more than reasonable prices.
Let Rusted Wheat
Thoroughly Ripen
Some wheat fields in this coun
ty are aifected by black rust. The
extent of the damage cannot yet
be fully determined but, while
more than was until recently
realized, the rust ravage is not
nearly so general or so damaging
as in many other sections where
the fields were more advanced
during the extreme heat. Ac
cording to competent, unbiased
opinions this section has about
the best crops in the state.
Farmers are asking the^ ques
tion: "When is the best time to
cut rusted wheat, not untilit has
fully ripened or while it is still
somewhat green?"
County Agent Hall this morn
ing wired E. J. Eastgate a high
authority connected with the
Better Farming^ Association, ask
ing an expression of opinion on
the matter. The reply received
said:
"Let it stand as long as pos
sible."
Professor H. L. Bolley, than
whom there is probably no high
er authority, made the question
the subject of a recent article.
He said b^ has conducted numer
ous experiments to determine if
rusted wheat should be_ cut green
or ripe and his conclusion is that
the best course is to let it get
thoroughly ripe.
Of the crop and price situation an
exchange says:
"The North Dakota wheat crop
may be below the usual standard
this year, owing to many adverse
conditions, but there are sections
of the state which will harvest
a good crop and there is consider
able consolation in the thought
that the farmer will receive a
record price for what he does get
from his fields.
"North Dakota is not the only
spot which will have a short
crop. It is a general condition
throughout the nation—in fact
throughout the world. Before
another crop is harvested there
promises to be a very marked
shortage in the world's food sup
ply-
"The present prices of wheat
are the highest in recent years,
and there are indications that
they will go still higher."

CUR TURNED TURTLE
FARMER LOSES LIFE
WILMER ECKERT KILED JUST
EAST OF CITY—F. R. PORRITT
SEVERELY INJURED
Wilmer Eckert, a farmer residing
between Williston and Spring Brook,
met death suddenly Tuesday after
noon when his Ford runabout turned
over on the main highway leading
east from the city at a point about
100 yards east of the main water
ditch.
Mr. Eckert, accompanied by City
Engineer F. R. Porritt was driving
into town after a trip to the Little
Muddv bridge. Mr. Porritt was se
verely bruised and shaken up_ but is
believed not to be seriously injured.
Cause of Accident Not Known
What caused the car to overturn is
not known. After the accident the
right front tire was found to be flat
but whether this was caused by the
accident or whether the car was be
ing driven in that condition is not
known. Mr. Eckert was caught be
neath the car and received such severe
internal injuries that he died within
a few minutes. Dr. Hagan, who
reached the spot within five minutes
after the accident occurred, states
that the victim was so crushed that
every vital organ was displaced or
received serious injury.
The remains were taken to Arsen
ault's undertaking rooms where they
have been prepared for shipment to
the former home of Mr. Eckert in
Ohio.
Came Here About Ten Years Ago
Wilmer Eckert was born in 1878 at
Bowling Green, Ohio. He came to Wil
liston about eight or ten years ago,
and since that time has improved a
fine 320 acre farm which is located
just north of Avoca. He was a bach
elor and spent considerable of his
spare time in Williston, where he had
a large circle of friends and was
highly esteemed as man and citizen.
He was a member of several fraternal
bodies including the Elks, the K. P.s
and the Moose. He was a man of
wide reading who interested himself
in politics and other public questions,
and was one of the local farmers who
accompanied the Burdick special on
its tour of the state in June.
He is survived by his mother, two
sisters and a brother who reside in
Ohio, and the remains were taken to
Port?5-0, that state, on No. 2 today,
where funeral services will be held
and interment made.
TO
BEGIN OPERATIONS
NATURAL GAS FRANCHISE IS
GRANTED—GROUND LEASES
AND MACHINERY SECURED
The Pioneer Oil and Gas Company
have secured from the city of Willis
ton a franchise to lay mains and sup
ply the citizens with natural gas.
The company have secured all the
leases required for drilling purposes,
in both Montana and North Dakota.
Despite the fact that never in the his
tory of the oil and gas industry in the
United States have there been so
many drilling rigs working as during
the present year, the company have
negotiated through their representa
tive in the Kansas field with a con
tracting firm that is highly recom
mended and has a first class and com
plete deep-drilling outfit which will
immediately be brought to the Wil
liston field, where the Pioneer Com
pany's first well will be drilled.
This makes sure that within a short
time Williston will hear a new whistle
and have added industry which if
successful will spell commercial ex
pansion for the community.
W. A. GARRISON BUYS AT
KENMARE
A deal has been completed whereby
W. A. Garrison, of Williston and B.
J. Rosenberg of this city, became the
owners of the Model Clothing and
Shoe Store, purchasing the business
from I. Rosenberg. Under the new
ownership B. J. Rosenberg will be in
charge, and he and Mr. Garrison ex
pect to leave the last of this week
for the eastern markets to buy the
fall and winter stock.
The Model, while one of the newest
concerns doing business in Kenmare,
has always enjoyed a nice patronage,
and with the increased lines of new
goods to be added to the stock, and
the punch the new owners will put
into the business, they should do well.

First Infantry Needs
Over 1000 Men
According to Col. Arthur Johnson,
commandant of Ft. Snellinc- where all
NorthDakot a recruits will be sent in
the future, the First North Dakota
Infantry is short about 1,000 to 1,200
men.
The regiment was taken out of the
state with only 900 men according to
Colonel Johnson and the state authori
ties have been urged to recruit the
organization up to full strength.
There has been some talk in this state
about raising another regiment, but
it is indicated that this cannot be done
until the First North Dakota is
brought up to its full strength. All
recruits will be taken to the regiment
now on the Mexican border.
In order that there may be econ
omy in recruiting, all North Dakota
recruits will be sent to Ft. Snellinar
and direct from there to the regiment
at the border.
But North Dakota is not tb°onlv
state that is short of men. Minne
sota stil needs about 2,200 men to
bring the regiments nn to the Maxi
mum. Recruits for these regiments
will also be sent to Ft. Snelling.
Velva Man Named

Child Run Over By
Auto, Escapes Injury
Glenn Turner, six-year-old son of
Mrs. Alvira Turner, who resides at
113 8th St. West, had a miraculous
escape from serious injury when he
was run over by ah auto last Saturday
afternoon, Aug. 5th.
The child was on his way down
town with his mother, and just as they
were crossing Broadway on 1st Ave
nue West, Mrs. Turner noticed an
auto coming around the corner. She
saw that they would not be able to
cross in front of it and called to the
boy, who was in front of her, to stop.
He either failed to hear her or
thought he had time to get across, for
he darted directly in front of the car
which knocked him down and passed
above him. Fortunately, the child
fell between the wheels and was un
injured. The auto was going slowly
at the time the accident occurred, and
stopped immediately, but Mrs. Turn
er says that the driver did not blow
the horn in warning.
Ray's Annual Fair
Draws Big Crowd
Last Friday, the first day of Ray's
Annual Grain Palace and Fair, found
the streets of that hustling city pack
ed with people from ihe farms and
surrounding towns.
The streets were gaily decorated
and many booths had been erected
for the vendine: of wares always at
tractive to holiday crowds. A com
modious pavillion served for band
concerts, speaking and dancing. The
palace or exhibit hall contained some
fine samples of grain, vegetables and
fruit. The woman's department was
crowded full of samples of splendidly
done art needle work.
The exhibits of horses and cattle
were unusual number and excellence.
These were judged by E. A. Chvm
berlain, a member of the Dakota
Farmer staff.
Mr. Chamberlain gave an interest
ing and instructive address at
pavillion in
most of his time to a discussion
the'
the afternoon,
devoting
of
the
value of a balanced system of diversi
fied farming and the folly of putting
all one's eggs in one basket.
The big entertainment feature of
the day was the
Cando-Williston
ball
game.
Saturday program was entirely
destroyed by the rain.
Sees Permanent Pros
perity For Williams
Isaac Lincoln, a man prominently
identified with financial and agricul
tural interests at Aberdeen, S. D.,
looked over Williston between trains
last Friday morning and is greatly in
terested in the development of this
city and section. He believes Williams
and surrounding counties are destined
for permenant prosperity on account
of our growiner live stock industry
and the fact that the farmers are
forewarned against the dangers of
the one crop habit.
Several miles north of Aberdeen
Mr. Lincoln has a 1,700 acre farm
that, judging from. several photo
graphs, is one of the finest and most
extensively improved in either state.
Live stock exhibits from this farm
were shown at the Fargo and Grand
Forks fairs.
Mr. Lincoln spent a day at the Ray
Fair admiring the live stock exhibited.
Local Distributors
Get High Ranking
No-Vary Vim, a trade publica
tion whose pages are right up to
the "Always Good" standard, in
its August issue, gives the stand
ing of the salesmen who are com
peting in the big contest insti
tuted by the No-Vary Products
Company. All salesmen con
nected with the Williston Grocery
Company—local distributors of
the "No-Vary" md "Bo-Ka"
brands of food products—hold
high positions in the lists.
A unique system of credits is
employed, based on the amount of
trade mark goods sold, by which
each salesman receives votes. The
total number of votes (o a sales
man's credit entitles him to "hold"
a national political office ranging
from President of the United
States to Consul to the Fiji
Islands.
M. J. Roberts is next to the top
in the ministerial service and ap

Norway."
J. H. Borden is "Minister to

WILLISTON WINS
STATE PENNANT
LOSES FIRST TO CANDO THEN
WINS THREE STRAIGHT—ACCI
DENT MARS LAST GAME
The Opportunes are It.
Best in North Dakota—state pen
nant winners!
From a five game series with the
celebrated White Sox of Cando, the
Williston team emerged, victors. The
count of the series, three games to
two, does not indicate the margain of
difference in the playing strength of
I the teams that was plainly to be ob
served by those who witnessed the
contests. Without the slightest de
sire to take from the Cando team any
of the credit due them, or to under
estimate its skill and strength, it can
conservatively be stated that the Wil
liston team proved its superiority bjr
its consistent strength in all depart
ments of the game and smoother, bet
ter team work.
The First Game
The first game was played at Rajr
Friday and was won by Cando 9 to #.
It was what is commonly termed a
"slugging match" in which the bat
ting of tne boys from Towner County
while no better in point of number
at
hits, netted more runs than that of
the Williston team. It was a game
that demonstrated the remarkable
I possibilities and reversals of form
common to base-ball. At the end of
the fifth inning the score stood six
to one in Williston's favor. Our boys
had made twelve hits and Cando two.
In the sixth inning Ruyle's arm went
bad and three singles and a home run
in quick succession enabled Cando to
tie the score. Browning succeeded
Ruyle in the box, but was not entire
ly successful in stopping the Cando
onrush. On the other hand, Carver,.
Cando's box man tightened up and be
came miserly with base hits, allow
ing his opponents but one more blow
and no runs.
The game was played on exceeding
ly rough grounds which made clean
fielding impossible. Williston's two-
errors were each costly, but this is*
not said by way of an alibi. Cando*
won the game and deserves full credit-
Totals of the game:

Second Game
An all day downpour made base ball'
out of the question Saturday. Both*
teams came to Williston and the first
game of the four game series was
played Sunday afternoon before a.
large crowd. It was an interesting
game and the Cando team put up ft
stiff fight to the end, but the result
was never much in doubt, as the visi
tors were outbatted and outfielded.
Browning was in the box for Willis
ton, and while there was plenty of
fielding for the Opportunes to do his
delivery yielded but one safe hit._ A
three-bagger in the eighth inning
which scored the two runners that
chanced to be on base.
Lefty Bird took the box for Cando
but had poor control and was succeed
ed in the third inning by Lantz.

Third Game
The third game was a repetition of"
the second only more so. The fins
and hits were in about the same ratio
as the Sunday game, but the local
team even more plainly demonstrated'
the superiority of their ail-around
work. Siebert, Williston's smallest:
pitcher was pitted against Iveenan,
the giant slab-man, who was the big
gest man on the Cando team. Some
of the fans were very anxious—it.
seemed improbable that F-ci
•-,ild
hold this team of dangerous hitters.
The first inning served to increase
the anxiety. The first man up push
ed the ball out for a three-bagger.
The third man up scored with a sin
gle, and right there, within five min
utes after the game begun it was all
over so far as Cando was concerned.
Two men were retired at first and one
was thrown out stealing second.
The remaining eight innings, Cando
got neither a hit nor a run, and only
two runners reached the first station
in safety, both of them on balls. Wil
liston played the prettiest fielding
game of the season. The infield and
outfield work was air-tight with noth
ing resembling an error. Keenanfor
Cando pitched good ball, but^ the Jo
cals managed to make four hits yield
two runs.

Fourth Game
Not quite satisfied with holding'
their opponents to two runs and one,
the Opportunes in the fourth game
clinched the argument with a shut
out. The game was much like those
of the two previous days and was a
splendid demonstration of the high
class ball that some of the independent
teams of the Northwest are serving,
up to the fans. All three games were
nothing less than league ball, and
not bush league either.
Carver, who worked the downfall
of the Opportunes in the Ray game*
was again on the mound for Cando,.
and Marshall shouldered the respon
sibility for the locals. The popular
manager was at his best, and while
he allowed three hits there was never
