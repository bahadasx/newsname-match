commanded the operator, John
Collins, and Nelson Brock and
a traveling man who were with

company cash amounting to $56,
which Collins had just checked
up to turn over to Rehm. , From
Rehm be got 55 cents, from the
traveling man $2 50, while Brock
had an empty pocket.
After this operation the ban

been apprehended.
Before the robbery the man
stood on the station platform and
talked with the traveling man
for several minutes.

The Chautauqua.
Oae of the best Cbautauquas
Baxter Spring has ever had will
be eiven here this year. No
money has been spared to get
some of the best lecturers, enter
tainers ane concert companies
Every number on the program
shows exce'lent professional tal
ent of a very high order. Every
person to appear on the stage is
an adept in his or her work
They are real "stars" bringing a
big lesson in a big way to every
bearer in the tent.
There is no number on this
year's program that has appeared
in any previous one. The change
is comlete and will agreably sur
prise the hearers as the first one
given to a Baxter bprings and
ience.
This is a rare treat given by a
company of men who like to help
Baxter Springs in an education
al and moral way. Every citi
zen should be a hearty supporter.
Give it a lift. Tell others of
its coming and encourage a full
attendance.
R. F. Hartley & Son's meat
market was removed last week
just two doors south into the
building lately occupied by Mrs.
Palmer the milliner. Mr. Hart
ley recently bought the property
he moved into. Mrs. Palmer
simply changed places with the
meat dealers.
Money for Road Work.
The Baxter Springs Commer
cial club recently organized is on
the job all the time, and getting
results.
Recently the matter of improv
ing the road from the bridge to
Lowell was taken up and a com
mittee appointed to secure ftnds
for regrading and surfacing the
stretch with river gravel. Three
hundred dollars was the amount
of the estimate for the job. A
conference with a Joplin commer
cial club resulted in a promise
from them to contribute $200.00
if Baxter Springs would raise
$100.00 of the amount. The
Baxter Springs committee raised
its share of the amount in one
day from the business men and
as soon as Joplin comes
across the work will be started.
When completed there will be
a good graveled road all the way
to Joplin, with the exception of a
few bad places between Lowell
and Galena.

Saw Something New.
Mr. and Mrs. D C. Satterlee
and son Neal. returned home
recently from Iowa where
they went by automobile.
They are enthusiastic in their
praise of the roads in Iowa, but
between Baxter and Kansas City
the roads are in a deplorable
condition. Many Iowa cities and
towns have a new way to park
cars on the business street.
Instead of turning into the curb
on either side the cars are lined
up in the center of the street.
This affords access to the curbs
for the discharge of passengers
and freight and all cars are han
dled without difficulty. This
plan surely septus very practical.
Thanks to Voters.
I certainly am more thankful
than I can express in words to
my numerous friends who gave
me such a fine vote in my success
ful candidacy for the Democratic
nomination for Sheriff of Chero
kee county.
I also want to say that I am
duly mindful of the confidence
expressed and when elected to the
office in November I do not intend
to foreet that I am the people's
servant duly sworn and bound to
enforce the law without fear or
favor. Again I want to thank
the voters of this county.
Yours truly.

They announce that they will

a man's business career. It imbues him with confidence

of last week was not as well at

but this no doubt was due to th
heat The program was gives
under the direction of Mrs. Han
