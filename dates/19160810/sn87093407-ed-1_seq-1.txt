OF CHAMBER
Mayor Gill clashed with the 100 business men
Wednesday who called him to the Chamber of Com
merce tor a conference on how to protect life and prop
erty during the water tront strike.
Ihe meeting had been called by too signers of a
petition tor sterner police activity, but more than
packed the assembly room, many standing thruout the
meeting.
A resolution was passed at the end ot the session,
which called on the mayor to "exercise his full power."
Judge Burke presided. Me said the city was "fac
ing a reign of terror which might spread like wildfire."
and declared that the police force was adequate to en
force order if the proper commands were issued.
Me regretted that "business men in pursuance of
their duties" should be attacked by "outlaws" and said
the city would wake up some day to find a business
man shot unless action was taken.
"Before railing on the mayor Is l
there anyone else who ha* any
■tone to suggest""" asked the Judge
