METHODIST
Sunday was a good dav with us.
160 in Sunday School and a nice
S'Ze congregation at the morning
service. It was another hot day in
the house. We were so glad to see
fr in any visitors present, and we
nsaure you a hearty welcome every
lime you can meet with us. The
li:rk service was well attended and
we had a good service. I must con
fess my surprise at the people of
various churches that have not
been to a single service this sum
mer at the park. Some are taking
it easy, some are taking joy ri les.
and so it goes I am frank to say
that I fear we have been making a
mistake and will have to meet it
in the judgment against us. The
services have been good but what
might they have been if all the pro
fessiug christians would have come
regularly and helped us out!
Next Monday we hold our last
Quarterly Conference and we should
have a written report from the
Missionary societies, Trustees and
various committees. This weather
is discouraging bin I hope we can
pull through with our work
C. I. Hov, Pastor.
GRACE BAPTIST
As previously unounced in our
notes there was no preaching last
Sunday, either in morning or even
ii g at the Grace church as the pas
tor was at liellileliein, where all the
st rvi es were well attended.
Superintendent of the Sunday
School reports a falling off in the
attendance. No discouragement on
our part should result, we are sure,
fur this seems a common complaint
H.iving been blessed with a shower
of ruin we hope the weather will
not again get so warm and that the
general health of the people will
improve May we all pull strong
for our school while we ask our
stives the question:
"ii everybody in my Sunday School,
Were just like me;
Wliut kino of a Sunday School
Would our Sunday School be?"
The ladies of the Women's Mis
bioonry Society report an enjoyable

Mack Green and Miss Anna Fields,
w'.-.se duly it becomes to meet the
Bo .id of Deacons and to co-operate
