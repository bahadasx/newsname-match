Take Provisions in and Arrest
Looters; Hundreds of Fami

By Associated Press
Charleston. W. Va., Aug. 10.—Twenty
three bodies have been recovered from
the debris carried down by the flood
which swept the Cabin creek valley,
near here, yesterday. Rescue parties
have penetrated some distance above
Cabin creek junction and meager re
ports brought back by courier and
from the railroads indicate that the
loss of life has been heavy, although
no accurate estimate can be made.
Persons driven from their homes to
the mountains are returning to find
whole villages of minin? cabins swept
away, while distress and suffering is
seen on every hand.
Two companies of the Second West
Virginia Infantry left Camp Kanawha
by trolley this morning and were taken
to Cabin creek ;unction with orders
to penetrate the valley and extend re
lief to all who needed it. They carried
provisions and tents.
Special Food Train
A special train was being made up
here on the Chesapeake and Ohio rail
road and will go as far as the hastily
repaired tracks will permit. From that
point numbers 01° men provided with
provisions will seek out the spots
where destitution is most pronounced.
It is expected that they will be able to
go the entire length of the valley and
penetrate adjoining valleys, also hard
hit. before to-morrow.
Reports reached here to-day from
United States Commissioner Howard
C. Smith, who led a relief party for a
number of mining companies last
night, that looting had commenced
and a number of arrests had been
made and soma property recovered.
The commander of the military has
been ordered to detail men to guard
property and restore order, leaving the
greater part of the relief work to the
many parties which will be in the val
ley before afternoon.
So great has lieen the loss that coal
companies with mines in the valley es
timate that manv thousands of dollars
will be needed to feed and clothe the
miners and their families, scores of
them having lost all their possessions.
Forty Known Dead
R. Jaco. a lineman of the Chesa
peake and Potomac Telephone Com
pany, reached Cabin Creek Junction
shortly before noon after a walk over
thirteen miles of the company's lines
between Miami and Desota. He de
clared that forty persons had been
drowned, and half that number of
bodies had been recovered.
Jaco was unable to get up the Kay
ford branch of the Chesapeake and
Ohio railroad but expressed the belief
that damage and loss of life in that
district was greater than in other sec
tions. The entire valley between
Miami and Desota was devastated, he
said, everything movable having been
washed away.
Excursion Marooned
The excursion train carrying 410
persons marooned by the flood was lo
cated to-day between Main Horse
creek and Little Horse creek with
washouts on both sides. Relief was
sent from St. Albans. Women and
children constitute the majority of ex
cursionists.
Soon after 11 o'clock the soldiers
reached Ronda where headquarters

DEMANDS SHOWN
At First Mediation Conference
Brotherhoods Hold Firm,
Status Unchanged
ADJUSTMENT IS DIFFICULT
See Little Chance of Reaching
Satisfactory Settlement;
Demands Explained
By Associated Press
New York, Aug. 10. The United
State Board of Mediation and Con
ciliation held its first conference to
day with the representatives of the
four railroad brotherhoods of em
ployes in its efforts to prevent through
mediation a country-wide strike to en
force the employes' demands for an
8-hour basic time and time and a half
for overtime.
Nothing was officially disclosed as
to the success the mediators met, but
it was learned on good authority that
'.he brotherhoods had shown no dis
position to modify their demands.
"The status is unchanged." was the
only comment which A. B. Garretson,
head of the conductors brotherhood
was willing to make after the con
ference adjourned.
"We have only scratched the sur
face." said G. W. W. Hanger, one of
the three members of the mediation
board. "The situation may be clear
ed within 24 hours and then negotia
tions may continue for a week."
The mediators arranged for a sec
ond conference with the railroad man
agers this afternoon and to meet the
brotherhoods' representatives again
to-morrow morning. To-day's meet
ing with the men was held in a down
town assembly hall and was attended
not only by the chiefs of the four
brotherhoods—the employes official
spokesman—but by the 600 delegates
of the unions who are here. It lasted
less than an hour. Outsiders were
barred.
Seek to Learn Concessions
It was assumed that the mediators,
as was the case at tneir first confer
ence yesterday with the railroad man
agers, sought to learn from the men
how far they were willing to go in
making concessions which would
bring both sides to common ground as
a basis of settlement.
The brotherhood chiefs told them
however, that they were still firm in
their demands as originally presented
to the railroads. While expressing
their appreciation of the efforts of
the mediators, it was said that they
informed them that they saw little
chance of reaching a satisfactory ad
justment. The mediators however,
it was said did not contemplate that
the men would offer concessions at
to-day's meeting. Most of the meeting
was devoted by Mr. Garretson to a
detailed explanation of the brother
hoods demands, upon which he made
it clear, it was understood, that they
stood firm.
Three Results Possible
There are three possible results of
the mediation. One is that the federal
board will be able to get the managers
and workers to sign an agreement.
Another is that the mediators will be
able to induce both parties to consent
to arbitration, if mediation fails The
third possibility is that the federal
board will fail in both these en
deavors.
Wilson May Take Hand
It was predicted to-day that if the
board should be unable to compose
the differences. President Wilson
would ask representatives of the con
tending factions to meet him in Wash
ington and that he would ask them
to arbitrate their differences The
mediators announced that no state
ment would be forthcoming from
them until they either have succeed
°, r , failed - It is understood that
the labor leaders pin their hopes of
settling the dispute upon mediation
rather than arbitration now that the
managers have failed to agree with
them. They are opposed to arbi
tration.

up the trouble between the railroad managers and the employes in an effort to settle the existing difficulties and
thus avert a strike. The Federal board which is not allowed to intervene until invited by one or the disputing
parties, was asked to take a hand in the deliberations, by the managers representing the 227 railroads involved

STRONG FIGHT
ON PARALYSIS
WILL BE WAGED
May Open Sanitary Hospital at
Almshouse to Care For
Victims
Harrisburg not only may open the
sanitary hospital on the almshouse
farm for the care of patients suffering
with infantile paralysis, but provision
may be made t'or erecting tents in the
hospital enclosure should the necessity
arise.
The problem was considered late
this afternoon by the Bureau of Health
and Sanitation following the report by
Dr. J. M. J. Raunick, city health
officer, thaj, Hrurisburg's third case of
the disease—tin* Lena Napolla, 126
Ann street—has developed in unusually
severe form.
The child is one of six small chil
dren of foreign parents. For days the
youngsters have been playing about
the densely populated neighborhood
with scores of other children and Dr.
Raunick told the bureau this after
noon that ,he deemed it best not to
take any chances.
The health bureau chief, inci
dentally, conferred with the Poor
Board relative to opening the mu
nicipal hospital.
"The Ann street case is particularly
deserving of attention," declared Dr.
Raunick, "and because of the fact that
there are so many other small chil
dren in the family and that the family
lives in such a congested district, I
think it might be wise to open the hos
pital and to arrange to set up tents in
the enclosure for attendants if neces
sary."
The Ann street case was diagnosed
by Dr. Oscar A. Newman, who re
ported the matter to the authorities at
once. Later Dr. Ix«unlck agreed with
this diagnosis.
Lengthens Quarantine

adopted Dr. Raunick's recommen
dation that the quarantine period for
