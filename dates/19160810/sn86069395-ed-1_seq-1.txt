MANY FRIENDS
OF DEAD JURIST
Attend the Funeral Services
Tuesday, From Other
Towns.
With sadness in their hearts, hun
dreds of the friends of Circuit Judge
J. T. Hanbery gathered at the First
Baptist church Tuesday afternoon at
4 o'clock and silently and feelingly
took part in the funeral cermonies
over his remains. Dr. Calvin M.
Thompson, pastor of the First Bap
tist church, in which Judge Hanbery
had been a loyal and active member,
conducted the services. Dr. Thomp
son had been in Barbourville hold
ing a revival meeting, and returned
for the sole purpose of conducting
the service.
A large number of out-of-town peo
ple came here to the funeral. Judge
Hanbery had friends in all parts of
the state. He numbered many per
sonal friends in the towns in his judi
cial district where his work as a
public servant had been largely con
ducted. Many men were present
from these towns. There were about
fifty people here from other cities.
Among these were: Judge McKen-
zie Moss, of Bowling Green; Dr. Mil
ton Board, of Louisville; Denny P.
Smith and Jno. C. Dabney, of Cadiz;
JohnB. Chilton, ofEddyville; Ran
dolph Mallory and Lewiit Chilton, of

of Calloway; John W. Hooks, Max
M. Hanbery, Cadiz. - .
The floral offerings were lavish and
beautiful. The designs were some of
the handsomest ever seen here. Two
large casket blankets and a number
of elaborate designs and sprays and
large number of smaller designs were
received. The bar in many towns in
Judge Hanbery's district, the Hop
kinsville bar, the courthouse officials,
the Fidelia Sunday School class, the
secret orders to which he belonged
and other organizations signified their
sorrow by floral offerings.
Interment took place in Riverside !
cemetery following the ceremonies.
The funeral procession was one of
the longest'ever seen in the city.
RESOLUTIONS BY CADIZ BAR.
Whereas, it has pleased Omnipotent
Providence to call froni his earthly
labors to his final reward, Hon. J. T.
Hanbery, Judge of the Third Judicial
District of Kentucky, the beloved
presiding Judge of the Trigg Circuit
Court, who departed this life on the
6th day of August, 1916, at his home
in uopKinsviiie, Kentucky, possess
ing a hope cf a blissful life beyond
the grave, therefore:
Be It Resolved, by the Cadiz Bar
and officers of the court, that in the
death of Judge J. T. Hanbery, the
Trigg Circuit Court has lost a presid
ing judge who was eminently qualified
to, and did courageously without fear j
or favor discharge the duties devol-'
ving on him, rightly construing the
law and giving even and exact justice
to all men. And who as a man and a .
citizen was foremost in furthering
those things and measures that wore 1
for the benefit of humanity, and the 1
elevation and uplift of mankind. In
friendship ho was true and devoted, I
possessing a rare charm of manner
that attracted the esteem and confl-.
dence of his fellow men. In thc home
circle he was devoted to his familv.
and was a faithful and consistent
j member of his church; and we doubt
not that on the
morning of Rosurrec-
tion he will recoive the reward that
his purity of life and conduct desorvos.
Bo It Further Resolved, that a copy
,ot these resolutions bo furnished his
widow, a conv furnished tho fLuli
Record and Hopkinsvillo Kentuckian
for publication and that they be ,
spread in full upon tho Order Book of I
the Trigg Circuit Court.

all that saved his life. With sheets

what material he could find. He
sewed three stitches in engineer
