LOUISE HUFF IN
DESTINY'S TOY
LYRICJONIGHT
Many" aie the treasures which lie
burled In tho sea, Joe Martin, n lono
llsherman had often dreamed that tho
sea had cast Its riches at his feet, but
Uls lsiou never was realized until
one day he waded out among the
rocks to pull ashore a bundle and
found a little gill! It was not the
treasuro of which ho had dreamed,
but as the days lengthened Into H'rs
Martin swore that old Father Neptune
had given him the greatest treasuro
Uu possessed.
And slnie beautiful Louise Hull Is
tho personification of the bounty of
the sea, thero will be thousands of
motion picture enthusiasts who will
Iogrco with Martin. It all happens
tu the famous Players production,
"Destiny's Toy," In which Miss Huff
Kfi4 makes her first appearance as a per
K,ir tnunent member of the Famous Pla
1 rs forces since winning a host of
friends by her delightful performance
In that company's celebrated adapt
ation of Denman Thompson's classic,
"Tho Old Homestead," In which she
scored such a personal success. "Des
tiny's Toy" Is the current Paramount
feature at tho Lyric.
Hut tho Joy of Martin and Nan Is
suddenly brought to a disastrous closo
by the death of tho fisherman. Nan,
now a full-grown young1 girl, sets out
to mako her fortune In the world and
decides to travel to tho city by freight
But she is pursued in the railroad
yard by tho police and falls Into the
hands of Dopey, a trusted member of
tho Illver Rats, who takes her undor
his sheltering wing, perceiving In her
a wonderful "blind" for his business,
which consists largely In separating
tho wealthy from their ill-gotten
gains.
Nan's arrival at Martin's doorstep
In tho gulso of a mermaid was due to
a shipwreck in which sho had lost her
mother. Her other namo was Carter,
and her father was a very wealthy
man who retired heart-bro-;t,n to his
beautiful homo and lived In practical
seclusion when ho learned of tho sup
posed loss of his dear ones. Now tho
crooks Into whoso hands Nan had fal
len decldo to rob Carter and Nan is
sent to gain admittance to the house
Sho does so, but Is caught by llobort
"a youthful clergyman,, whom Cartor
has adopted to consolo him In his old
age.
Struck by tho girl's apparent inno
cenco and believing that a proper en
vironment will have a great lnfiucneo
upon her llobort has her placed In his
custody. His charitable act Is tho be
ginning of almost endless trouble and
worry, for tho youth ns ho Is torn be
tween lovo for this strange girl and
tho Increasing Iro of his congregation
at his apparent fall from grace. Tho
story -works up to a great climax,
vt- which is precipitated by tho re-op-
' pearenco of tho crooks.
In addition to Mlsa Huff tho cast in
eludes Bovcral other popular playors,
among thorn John llowors, J, W. John
ston and Harry Loc.

entIon, due to the tense contest that
wns staged for tho gubernatorial

ties to ballot gave him 207 votes
Wcbex gave him 37 votes and Box LI
der caBt her solid vote of 23 for him
In tho same six counties Governor
Spry received 144 1-2 votes.
The light right at the start slm
ruered down to n contest between ho
governor and Mr. Morris with the
Indications that It was only u ques
tion of ballots until Mr. Morris would
bo returned the nomlneo. Mr Morris
gained 39 votes on the second ballot
whllo Governor Spry gained 2.
Tho third ballot brought Mr. Mor
ris 313 2 3 votes, the number neces
sary to a choice, when H. 0. Pace,
a Wayne county delegate, contrary
to the understanding of his chairman
who announced all the county'.! oto
for L. It. Anderson, cast his vote for
Morris. Tho count, In view of the
chairman's declaration, gave Morris
only 312 2 3.
Then ensued n dispute the Morris
supporters claiming the nomination
on tho strength of the 312 2 3 count,
as It was moro than half of tho 02 o
votes In the convention
During tho controversy tho vote of
V.'ajno county was challenged and
then Delegate Pace announced his
vote for Morris, which clsa'cl the
atmosphcro and gave Morris tho
nomination without further ido.
Without tho additional vote tho
fourth ballot would havo brought Mr.
Morris tho nomination, as Utah cacn
ty' stood ready to switch eovn voVjs
to him on tho next ballot.
Tho finnl balloting for governor wis
as follows: Morris 313 2-3; Spry 193;
Jenkins 42 1-2.

North street. They havo now done
away with the old buildings and havo
moved Into tho new one erected on
the same property. The now building
gives the proprietors more room and
supplies all of the conveniences

will enauie the new owners to give
better service and servo more than
could possibly have been done In the
old quarters, besides adding more of
a metropolitan air to the place.
Of course the quality that has al

We congratulate these Logan boys in
taking over this business, and wish

CUTTING DOWN II
SHADjJREES II
Kdltor Hepubllcan: dBI
In Maine and tho District of Colum-
bin no on? can cut down a ttec, oven ufl
uu his own premises, without tuo ill
consent of the authorities. In most HI I
states, one cannot remove n tree fifl
from tlio sidewalk without the con- HI
sent of the municipal authority. In fill
Logan apparently any one can re- HI
move a tree from the street, or any Bl
other placo without seeking the con- Hffl
tout of nny person whatever. Hfl
The Telephone, Telegraph, and (SIH
l'lcctrlc compnules cut down, buck, Bsl
and mutilate trees as though thoy ill
were tho sole owners of the streets IS I
and the rulers of tho abutting prop- "SI
my owners, and the apathy of tlio nil
public under such treatment Is pos- l
Itlvcly sickening. WmU
The ono thing which distinguishes UU
Logan from the dry and desert west- HI
cm towns In general Is the number ftS
of bciutlful trees, which lino Its HI
streets. They nro the admiration ot HSl
every stranger who comes to town. 'nil
Tho peculiar thing Is that the people. rcffl
who havo spent n Hfo time watching j
theso trees reach their present ma- W?m
turlty seem to care less about pre- HI
serving them thnn the stranger with- all
In our gates, or elso thoy aro overaw- HI
ed by tho soulless corporations whose HI
only Interest In tho town and Its poo- HI
pie Is to exploit them for all they HI
will stand, and do not understand Hi
their rights In the subject matter. Hi
The nhuttlng property owner has HI
i special ownership in trees which fell
ho lias the right to protect, whether III
the city owns the streets or" not. 'Mm
Head tho language of ono ot tho most SI
recent court decisions on this 'sub- HI
II
"It tho owner ot vvlros, within tho HI
spaco occupied by trees, cutswback- HI
, tho trees to sever or prevent their fll
contact with the wires, and thus In- Sal
Jures the trees, and depreciates tho HI
value of the abutting lot of such ape- HI
clal owner, tho latter Is entitled to HI
recover damages therefor.
Only when public necessity, ns dls- HI
tlngulshed from any necessity ot tho HI
private owner of the trees or tho HI
prlvato owner ot wires. Justifies such U!l
an act, may tho city authorize such HI
owner of wires to Invade the spaco b
occupied by trees, or to Inflict any F
substantial Injury or damage upon K'll
such other, without due compensa- q
tlon'" ' B.1I
The measuro ot damages In such f&M
a case is not the value of the troo, eH
but tho difference between tho value HH
of the abutting property with the S
trees, and without the trees, or with BH
the trees, In their natural condition MJ
and In their mutilated condition. H
Tbe supreme court of Washington pH
recently nfllrraed an award ot $178 JJJ
for mutilating tho trees lu front ot HJ
an abutting proporty owner in Seat- BH

It Is up to some one to make a JJJ

AGREE ON PLAN I
OF ARBITRATION I
Washington, -Aug. Formal an- H
nouncement that a Joint International vH
commission will seek a solution tor jH
border disputes between the United H
States and tho Mexican de facto gov- jH
cromont probably will be made to H
morrow. Acting Secretary Polk an: H
Ellsco Arredoudo, General Carranza s H
r.mbassador, virtually concluded their H
preliminary conferences today. jH
It is regarded as Improbable that H
additional diplomatic correspondence H
will bo necessary. Mr. Arredondo as- H
sured Mr, Polk today that his gov- H
iirnmont was willing that the commis- H
slou should havo a broad scope, but mm
.that It wished to see tho immedl- H
nto questions arising from tho border mm
situation disponed of first. State de- H
partment ofllclals agreed with that H
(ontentlou W
President Wilson Is ebeperted p an- H
nouuco tho American membership or H
tho commission at onqo. It Iras been H
agreed by Mr. Polk and Mr. Arrodon- H
do that selection of tho place tor the PJJ
