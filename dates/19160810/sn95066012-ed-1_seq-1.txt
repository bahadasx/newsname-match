FRANK C.
Of
Vu
n State Banking Laws, Deceiving
Depositors, Using Misleading Advertising
and Manipulating His Bank Stock
To Avoid Taxation
Newport, Aug. ?. In a statement
issued Ik Hank Commissioner Frank
P. Williams, made public tonight, the
veiled charge! SgalnSt Senator Page's
bank are dragged ruthlessly Into the
open and every allegation made is hot
enly substantiated but the record of
six years of misrepresentation, evas
ion of taxes and violation of state law
la set forth in circumstantial detail.
To tho three questions, regarding
the conduct Of the bank the bank com
missioner answers in the affirmative.
He fixed the date of the misleading ad
vortising as late as 1H 12 and declares
that the evasion of taxes has not only
continued for six years but that at the
time of his latest examination a cer
tain bank was still hoing useu oy
Senator age to avoid local taxation.
Hank Commissioner Williams says:
"Summing up the charges which
have- been made with reflect upon
the administration of the banking de
partment of Vermont:
First, it is charged that Sena
tor Page transferred bank stock
stock which he owned to avoid taxa
tion; Second, it is charged that the
Lamoille County Savings Hank and
Trust company, of Which Senator
Page is president, issued mislead
ing advertisements with relation to
the manner in which the money of
its depositors was invested; Third,
it in charged that some directors of
the bank Indorsed or guaranteed out
Of state loans by the bank is an
amount very much larger than the law
allows; Fourth, it is charged that the
bank commissioner must have known
of these practices, and if lie did not
cr.rreet them, failed In Ills duty us an
officer of the state.
As to the first three charges 1
must answer in the affirmative.
"As to the fourth charge, I discov
ered the illegal acta; tho misleading
advertisements; the use of bunks
to evade taxation; that four of the
(til o tors, including Senator I'age,
had incurred liabilities to the bank
very largely in excess of the legal
limit, which is $10,000, and 1 acted
In each case promptly nfter com
plete practices to be abandoned af
ter a good deal of effort."

ment IS made in reply
the Rutland Herald lor
to a request
ii statement
ot
atiVS to the charges made against
Senator I'age in relation to his hank
ing methods. The statement in part
is as follows:
"For several weeks I have noticed
news items and editorial statement
in several vetmont newspapers, charg
Ulg that the banking methods of the
Lamoille County Savings Bank and
Trust company, of which Senator
Fane Is president, have been illegal.
and misleading to the depositing pub
lie, and very strongly intimating that
the bank commissioner had either
been negligent in the performance of
his duties, or had overlooked the
faults in tho management of that par
ticular bank. The Morrisville Mes
songer, answering apparently for Sen
ator I'age, stated that the depositors
of the bank had not been deceived by
the hank's advertisements, and that
no improper or illegal practices by
the bank had been discovered by tin
bank commissioner. On August 1 I
noticed an editorial in the Hrattlc
boro Reformer, making more ipet i i
charges with relauon to the pracUcea
Of the bank, and charging that Hit
bank commissioner has been derelict
in his duty, and the Randolph Her
ald last week stated that, 'it the hank's
methods were improper, it was the
duty of the bank commissioner to
proceed. Not having done so it is too
much to expect him to give evidenci
against himself.' An editorial in the
! Rutland Herald the last week in .Inly
reviews these charges and others witu
i relation to the same matter, and asks
I the bank commissioner whether, he
; hns ever had cause to criticize bena
I tor Page's methods, first, regarding
' the evasion Of state taxes, second, n
gardlttf misleading statements ' his
advertisements, third, regarding th
guarantee by some of the bank's ill
lectors of funds invested outside Vcr
mont. The Reformer states that I
have been repeatedly asked to stat
the facts with relation to the methods
of Senator I'age. and have not replied
I have hoped that Senator I'age won
frankly state the facts with relation
lo nil the matters referred to. ami :is
to the position taken bl the balik com
missioner. which would certainly
i
II
clear the banking department of any
suspicion of negligence or favoritism
witli relation to the practices referred
to, and would also assure the public
that all would practices had been stop
ped, and would thus avoid any possi
ble claim that the bank commissioner
WSS making any statement for politi
cal purposes, but I am very jealous
of the reputation of the banking de
partment of Vermont, and am not will
ing that the people Of the state should
;et a wrong impression as to the at
titude of the bank commissioner with
relation to illegal or improper prac
tices bv olhcers of any banks over
which he has jurisdiction. This is
my in reason for answering the charges
which have been made. 1 think it is
fully as important that the people of
the state should have confidence In
the intergrity ami Independence of the
bank commissioner, as that any par
ticular individual should be elected
I'nited States senator. 1 realize that
the people of this state have a right
to know what the attitude of the
hank Commissioner has been towards
any improper or illegal practices ot
the banks, hut 1 wish to have it plain
ly understood that during my term
,,i n'.ln e a ; Iuiik commissioner, t he
money deposited in tho Lamoille
County Savings Hank and Trust com
pany has been sale, and the bank
has been solvent, and its condition at
the present time is better, and the
bank is stronger than at any time dUr
ing the past six years.
Sums Up Charges.
Summing up the charges which
have been made by the various news
papers during the past six weeks,
which I have seen, which reflect up
on Hie ailiniiustiatlon i tin- Laiikin
department of Vermont:
"First, it is charged that Senator
ige transferred bank stock which he
o.vnei! to avoid taxation.
Second . it is charged that the
Lamoille County Savings Hank and
rust company, of which Senator I'age
is presiilent, issued misleading ad-
itfsenionts with relation to the man
ner in which the money ot its deposi
tors WM invested.
Third, It is charged that some di
rectors of tue bank indorsed or guar
anteed out of stato loans b the bunk
is un amount very much larger than
the law allows.
'Fourth, it is charged that the
bank commissioner must have known
of these practices, and if he did not
correct them, failed in his dutj as an
ollicer of the state.
Answers in Affirmative.
'As to the lirst three charges I must
answer In tho affirmative.
As to the fourth charge, discov
ered thi' illegal acts; the niKlcidln r
Ldvertisemont; the use of banks to
evsde taxation; that lour of the di
rectors, including Senator I'age, had
incurred liabilities to the hank vey
largely In excess of the legal limit,
which is $10,000, and I acted in each
case promptlv alter complete niionna-
Hon. and caused all such practices to
he abandoned alter a good deal of ef
lort. ami I will state fully and frankly
the fads with relation to all tbSUC
mutters, as they have existed during
my term of office, and as they exist at
the present time.
I found that the Lamoille County
Savings Hank and Trust company had
been investing in real estate mort
gages outside Vermont lor several
ears. the amount ut that lime being
something over onoquartor fit a mil
lion of dollars and was advertising un
der the slogan All in Vermont." I
took up the matter with Senator Page,
the president of the bank, and II. .M.
Mo.MI-'ai land, the vice-president, i.iid
advised them that the advertisement.
in my Judgment was misleading, in
that it caused the people of Vermont
lo believe that the bank did not in
ost in out of state mortgages as many
other banks were doing, but that It
Invested all. of Its funds in Vermont. I
ascertained that two of the directors
of the hank had guaranteed the
amount ot these out of state loans un
ST an arrangement with Senator Page
by which he paid them Irom his own
pot ket a commission lor their guar
antee, ami he Insisted that it was a
rfectly proper thing to do; that it
made the loans Vermont loans. and
that the hunk had a light under UlOJM
circumstances to advertise that ail its
in ve-intents were made in Vermont
Ither upon real estate loans or with
two good Vermont names. I Insisted
that under the law the directors hnd
no right to guarantee such loans in
such amounts, ami that the prucUoi
must ho stopped, both as to guarantee
mg the loans bv the directors, ami as
to the form of the hank's advertise
incuts- that the other directors whose
indebtedness was excessive must n
dine it to the legal limit, and was ns
sured that 1 should have no cause tor
criticism in those matters in the fu
lure.
Noticed Advertisements.
"Some two years later I noticed nd
vertisetnents of a similar character
answering John Senior's criticisms
and called the attention of Senator
I'age and Mr M I n laud to the agree
incut made two years before, which
thought hud not hen honestly kept
I also discovered that the bank, at tho
reddest of Senator I'age, was about to
lines! further In out ot state niort
gages and he had asked the t reason
to accept the indorsement upon siien
mortgages of a locnl corporation in
vhich Senator Page and other officer
of the bank were largely Interested. I
obieited to this and wrote a letti r t
Senator Page stating my nhlcctions
lie tailed for a conference upon th
uUter ami I met him ami Mr McFu
I .oid and spent a day with them goin
over the matter fully, Senator I'age
insisted that their practices were
right and ought to be allowed, and
that the iositioii which I took was pre
venting the hank from getting addi
tional security. I took the position
that the only right and proper thing
for the bank to do was to observe the
law which governed in such matters,
and that it was bad policy in any event
for the bank to make out of state in
vestments which they were not fully
satisfied wore absolutely sound and
safe, and that when he Induced his di
rectors to guarantee out of state
loans, paying them for the guarantee,
he was offering an Inducement to ac
cept loans In which the bank might
not otherwise invest, and tha; I
should insist that the bank's invest
ments be made according to la'.v. If
the law was( wrong he should lake, that
matter up with the Legislature, but
that 1 believed it was a very wise pro
vision in the law which prohibited di
rectors of a bank from borrowing
from the bank, or becoming indebted
to the bank in Riich amount.,, and un
der such circumstances as prevailed
in that bank, letter, a very serious
weakness developed in one line of out
of state loans guaranteed by tj di
rectors, and Mr. McFarland frankly
stated that the loans would not have
been made if Senator I'age had not
paid the directors a commission to
guarantee them. Mr. McFarland se
cured the hank againsl a possible loss
on these loans. After several hours'
discussion Senator Page finallv said
that he would comply with my request
and that I should have no further
cause for criticism, although he be
lieved was wrong in my position
From the first critic ism which I made
of the policies of the bank up to the
present time, Mr. McFarland has al
ways agreed that I was right In im
position; thst the policy of the bank
had been wrong, and that he was very
glad I was insisting In a change and
would cooperate with me in every
way ln.sslide to improve conditions
ind eliminate all bad practices, which
he has faithfully done to the present
time.
Makes Several Discoveries.
In the summer of lirn I discovered
thai several state banks had annar-
ntly purchased In March, stock of
Other banks and national hanks held
by officers of those banks, and that
shortly after April 1, a part of su h
stock was re-transferred to Its forme:
owners at the same price nc which it
had been purchased. I Inquired into
the matter and discovered that Sen
ator i'age had transferred a large
amount of stock owned by Mm in a-
ious banks to various other banks
shortly bents the first of April and
hud received an agreement from the
ankn to which such stock was irai s-
f erred that it would be returned 10
him on demand at the price of trans
fer, ami the same transaction had lak-
n place between various banks and
the various olhcers and stockh.d I m-s
In other banks. I was convinced, as
the result of my investigation, that
these transactions were solely for the
purpose of evading the payment of lo
ll taxes on such bank stock, and I
notified all such bunks that I did not
think a bank chartered by the state
should allow itself to lie used for the
purpose of evasion of taxes, and rec
ommended that nt once they require
the stdler to repurchase the stock or
release the bank from its agreement
to re sell, and sent a circular to all
the state banks calling their attention
to the situation and making a similar
recommendation, l found one hnnV
which kept such stock, and was a.lvis.
ii mm me agreement nan neon re

my Inst examination of that hank I
discovered that the hank had nSfrl

and ." per rent interest on the imnnnl
