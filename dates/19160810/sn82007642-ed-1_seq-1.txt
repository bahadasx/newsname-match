GOOD ROAD TALK. '
Mr.- Editor: I know of no pub
lic interests which now need at
tention more than does the pub
lic roads of this county, It seems
that there is an apparent indif
ference on the part of those in
power to an . extent not inten
tional, I take it, but nevertheless
it exists. It seems that there is
a spirit on the part of our peo
ple to the effect that the condi
tion of the roads has sufficed for
those of the past, and it is pood
enough for us and our posterity.
Our county, one of the very best
in North Carolina, has been es
tablished nearly seventy years,
and thousands of our forefathers
have passed away after having
put in their allotted time on the
public roads of Watauga county,
just as we are doing, yet without
regard to the very best grades
possible, and the permanency of
the work done, when done, by wi
denining, macadamizing, drain
ing, culverting and bridging,
'" hence nothing but a repetition
of the same sort of work goes on
and at the same rate will be for
time indefinite.
The country on all sides of us
is awake. Why not we? By ref
erence to Chap. 122, public laws
of 1913, Sec. 1; also the Acts of
1815, Chap. 237, and Gregory's
Biennial Revisal, 1015. Sec. 2,
691, we can see at a glance that
the legislature has prepared a
way by which we can, if we only
will, tave not only a temporary
but a permanent good condition
of our public roads throughout
our entire county. Boone being
the center of the county, and pre
sumed to take the lead and place
an example before us for the bet
terment of our public condition,
why not, under these provisions.
Boone take the first steps, and if
it will do is and start out the
work from that pointfor the per
fecting of road conditions, then
I have no doubt that other
townships will follow and within
a very few years have our public
roads in such condition that af
ter having traveled double the
distance one would not be so wor
ried as under present conditions
after having traveled half the
distance. Good suggestion this,
but the writer will take notice
that Boone has. since the heavy
rains taken over 2,500 in stock
in the B. & B. It. Turnpike, for
the sole purpose of giving an out
let for our people, not wholly
as an investment. We consider
the pattern laid for the remain
der of the county. Democrat
Take the public road leading
from Cove Creek tp Boone, a dis
tance of only eight or ten miles,
and one can ordinarily travel a
distance of 20 to 30 miles on the
roads of Avery county with
much more ease and in a very
much Lshorter time, and with
double tue weight, all because of
the difference in the condition of
the two roads, notwithstanding
Avery being an infant and V a
taujra being of full aire and as
serting her real manhood, al
though I shall not assert that we
should attempt to take on too
much burden, and particularly if
we were so youngasisoursplen
did neighbor Avery.
I have no other object in view
than that we may go to think
ing for our very best public in
terest with regard to our roads,
as these are the most used for
all purposes for the whole peo
ple than almost any other one
improvement in a country and
further that we may go forward
to the doing of things rather
than all talk and nothing done.
Let's think and then proceed to
do the best improvement yes,
the very best permanent improve
ment of ouf roads and that by
having thought for the very bes t

PROPHECIES.
Prof. Bert Reeso of New York,
said to be a noted oracle "the ge
nuineness of whose clairvoyant
powers and cosmic insight is
vouched for by hard-headed men
in the various professions and in
the fields of science, philosophy,
phychology, education and busi
ness," according to report, has
delivered himself of the following
prediction:
That the present world -war will
come to an end September 7th,
1916;
That the Upited States will
:iave war with Japan three years
rora now;
That Wilson will be elected for
a second term;
That Henry Ford will follow
Wilson in the presidential chair
and will serve longer than any
previous President.
The prediction that the war
will end a month hence is com
forting to the public generally;
the prediction that Woodrow
Wilson will be re-elected is cons
orting to Democrats and simply
confirms their belief. In fact
most of them will say that it re
quires no peculiar insight into
future events to make that pre
diction. The prophecy of a war
with Japan three years hence is
very discomforting, but it will be
water on the wheels of the pre
paredness folks. The prediction
that Henry Ford will follow Wil
son as President and will serve
onger than any other President,
woich means that he will be re-e-
ected for more than one term, is
calculated to cast doubt on all
the prophecies of Seer Reese, for
no matter how high an opinion
one has of Mr. Ford, he has so
ar failed to disclose qualities
that make him presidential size
or whould keep him in office in
definitely as if by a freak of for
tune he should be chosen. It .is
possible, however, that Prof.
Reeso figures that a year of war
with Japan and we would be
at war with Japan the last year
of the second Wilson admin intra-
tion, according to his prediction
would so disgust the Ameri
can people with war that they
would not only elect a peace ad
vocate, such hs Mr. Ford ie.Pres-
dent but would keep him in office
indefinitely,
We will soon be iu position to
test the accuracy of Prot. Reeco's
first prediction. If that is verified
wo can then make up our minds
as to what will believe as t ) the
other. However, it would be just
as well for everybody who wants
Mr. Wilson re-elected to do a
little campaign work and chip in
a little cash for the campaign
fund. It is well enough to hope
that prophecy will be fulfilled
but it is bettor to do our best to
help it come true. Statesville

THEY ASK FEDERAL AID.
Congressman Doughton, who
returned to Washington "last
week, after a few days at his
home, introduced a resolution
appropriating $300,000 for the
flood sufferers in western North
Carolina, the money to be expen
ded under the direction of the
Secretary of War. The Wash
ington correspondent of the
Greensboro News says:
Mr. Doughton decided to in
troduce the resolution after a
conference between himself and
Representatives Tage and Webb.
All three are of the opinion that
something must be done to aid
the people of the western part of
the State and decided they would
have the resolution introduced
and use their influence to have it
passed. They realize, however,
that it is going to be a bard job
to get such a measure through
Congress, as Minority Leader
Mann of Illinois is almost sure
to make an objection, which
would result in its defeat.
Mr. Doughton says it is impos
sible for anyone to estimate the
damage done by the floods in his
section of the State. He said it
was so great and so far beyond
the human imagination that the
people have not yet been able to
realize just what has happened.
"I am not a drinking man" said
Mr. Doughton, "and therefore
do not know how a man feels
when afflicted with delirium tre
mens, but what I saw in North
Carolina is so appalling that I
can easily believe that a man af
flicted with this form of alcohol
ism might imagine anything.
Whole farms have been wiped off
the mnp with a single landslide.
Hundreds of men who have been
prosperous and happy citizens
are now roaming about the coun
try with no place to go and ma
ny of them declare they will not
again return to their former
homes. Hundreds and hundreds
of acres of fertile land along the
railroad that usually produced
the finest crops in the land, are
today nothing more than worth-
less sandheaps. A few acres may
be used for cultivation but the
larger part of the lowlands will
not be worth cultivation for ma
ny years if ever."
Mr. Doughton himself lost hea
vily but he is a well-to-do man
as values go in that t-ection of
the country. He is chiefly con
cemed for the poor fellows those
who rent land who have noth
ing to do nor a place to lay their
heads. Much of the rich low
lands of Mr. Doughton's farm at
Laurel Springs is totally ruined
Barns and outbuildings have
been swept away roads comple
tely destroyed; not a bridge in
the county and his 300-acre tim
othy hay crop covered in sand

His handsome home, located at
the foot of the mountain and
within a hundred yards of the
stream which flows through his
farm, was flooded with water and
much of the furniture completed
ruined. Statesville Landmark.

$50,000 to Rebuild Bribes and Roads.
Lenoir Topic.
In response to a call of the
county commissioners, a large
number o representative citizens
from different parts of Caldwell
met in mass meeting in the court
house Monday at 1 o'clock to
consider methods and plans for
building and repairing tba coun
ty bridges and roads which were
destroyed by the recent floods.
Mr. J. L. Nelson was raadeclmir
man of the meet ing.
Reportsof committees appoint
ed at former meeting to investi
gate matter of forry across Ca
tawba and bridges across the
different streams, were made and
adopted. The ferry across the
Catawba is now in operation,
but the service is inadequate.
The approximate cost of the
bridges which have been washed
away was estimated at about
$19,000.00, but it is believed
that the high price of material
will make the cost of rebuilding
twice as much as original cost.
The motion of Mr. F. II. Cof
fey, slightly amended, that the
commissioners of Caldwell coun
ty be requested to borrow $50,
000.00, and later issue bonds to
pay off same, the sum to be used
in the discretion of the commis
sioners, in building and repair
ing the bridges and highways of
the county, was adopted by an
almost unanimous vote. There
was urgent demand for immedi
ate relief to the people on John's
river from Collettsvile to Globe,
and work to open an outlet in
that locality was authorized to
begin at once.
The First National Bank, of
Richmond, Va. through their lo
cal connection here, the Bank of
Lenoir, made the county the ge
nerous offer of the loan of $50,-
000 for six months at the very
low rate of four per cent per an
num. In the offer as submitted
it was explained that it wa'sx not
made with a view to profit but
with an earnest desire to be ofser
vice to a section of the State from
which it derives valued patron
age.
The matter of giving immed
iate relief to the flood sufferers on
Johns River, Wilson's Creek and
Buffalo received special attea.

these water courses are in great
distress, and urgent, earnest and
pathei ic appeals wero made for
help to build passable roads, giv

can become self supporting. Lv
cry citizen in the county, who is
able to do so, is invited to con-1
tribute something for the relief
of our distressed neighbors and
contributions from any outside
source will be gratefully received.
Messrs. W. C. Newland and W. N.
