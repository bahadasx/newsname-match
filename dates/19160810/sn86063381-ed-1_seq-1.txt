A 1917 CHAUTAUQUA.
The Chautauqua has proved to
be a vital force in Bemidji and
every effort should be made to
see that it is an annual affair in
Bemidji. ^'-Hw^V'- /H 'L
Last year 30 Bemidji men
guaranteed the Chautauqua for
this year. Surely over 30 men
will guarantee the Chautauqua
for next year.
A Chautauqua is preferred to
wandering shows and all cheap
clap-trap: The Chautauqua has
ant educational value. It is a
good thing for the community..
Everybody should boost for
the 1917 Chautauqua.
There has been some talk of
citizens dropping the Chautau
qua.
If education is profitable if
culture is to be desired if mor
als pay if clean entertainment
is preferred if progress beats
stagnation if Bemidji people
demand the best things the gen
eration affords then hold on to
the Chautauqua. It is the cham
pion of neighborhood life at its
best.

THIS MORNING
Nominee Leaves at Noon for Fargo
Where He Will Make an Ad
dress Tonight.
FLATS DEMOCRATS
IN ST. PAUL SPEECH
Mexico is Held Up as Text Says
American Bullets are Killing
U. S. Troopers.
Grand Forks, N. D., Aug. 10.
Charles E. Hughes, Republican can
didate for the presidency of the Unit
ed States, was the guest of Grand
Forks this morning. He arrived here
at 7:35 over the Great Northern rail
way. He gave an address here and
left at noon fofr.Fargo, N. D., where
he will give art address tonight. He
will continue his journey to the Pa
cific coast tomorrow.
Policy! Inadequate.
St. Paul, Aufe. 10.Charles E.
Hughes speaking last night in the
Auditorium here assailed the admin
istration for its preparedness policy
which he declared inadequate, assert
ed that he regarded "reasonable pre
paredness as a priamry duty," and
purposed if elected to see that it is
discharged to the credit of the Am
erican people.
"We are a spirited people," Mr.
Hughes declared. "We are a people
that can protect ourselves. We are
not too proud to fight!"
Militia Inefficient.
Much of the nominee's address was
devoted to the Mexican situation and
the calling of the national guard to
service on the border: There had
been warnings for two years -that
America should be prepared. Mr.
Hughes said, ye$, when the time came
to put an army on the border, "to do
police servic," there was presented
"a spectacle showing inefficiency of
mimttiA .".V""r
theflrst.mjaj^itU
%e admfhfswIktlonWembargo on^
arms to Mexico was criticized as
"fast and looseno policy."
Killed by U. S, Bullets.
"I don't think it a rash statement,"
the nominee said, "I think it is war
ranted by the fact to say that any
American soldier killed in Mexico is
killed by American bullets that we
have let go oyer the border.":
Mr. Hughes referred to a recent ad
dress to the senate by Senator Lewis
of Illinois.
"He didn't like some statement of
mine," the nominee said. "They
distressed him. I am glad of it. That
was the intention. But there wasn't
a word in it what I said that he or
anybody else could answer."
Punished Ourselves.
The punitive expedition fo Mexico,
Mr. Hughes said, was only called
punitive.
"The only vvntehmeiU irfiitted was
pvnishment inflicted on ourselves,"
he said. vVe punls'i nobod7 else.'
A large proportion of the nominee's
address was devoted to reiteration ot
his views on the need for industrial
co-operation and preparation for com
mercial competition to Europe after
the war.

RAILWAY STRIKE
BELIEVED AVERTED
BYEMPL8YES'ACTION
Railroad Brotherhoods Accept
Proffer of U. S. Board of Media?
tion and Conciliation.
PRESIDENT WILSON TO
BE REQUESTED TO AID
Efforts of Mediators to Bring Fac
tions Together are Well Under
Way, Says Report.
New York, Aug. 10.The threat
ened strike of the 400,000 railway
employes of the United States was
averted yesterday when the railroad
brotherhoods accepted a proffer of
the United States board of mediation
and conciliation to mediate their dif
ferences with the railroads.
Appeal to President.
If the United States board of medi
ation and conciliation fails to adjust
the differences between the railroads
of the country, and their 400,000 em
ployes, President Wilson will be given
to use.his personal influence to avert
a general strike.
The appeal to the president would
be the last resort and would be taken
only to save the nation from the
trade paralysis that would follow the
strike of the magnitude planned by
the railroad men.
Efforts Under Way.
The efforts of the mediators to
bring the contending factions to
gether were well under way today.
Mediation was. suggested in lieu of
arbitration under the Newlands act
or by the interstate commerce com
mission, proposals which have been
rejected by the brotherhood.
EQUALIZATION BOARD
COMPLETES DUTIES
The board o^ejjialization_o|
trami county finished-Jits sessions this
morning. Assessments throughout
the whole county were equalized. A
large percentage of the revisions are
in the form of increases and but very
few instances of decreases are on re
port.
By resolution, the board of equali
zation voted to call the attention of
the tax commission to the advantage
to this county of holding meetings of
instruction for assessors befor.e the
next assessment. As both Baudette
and Grygla, at which places the
board recommended the meetings be
held, are too remote to receive in
structions, the assessors have under
taken the work without the proper
instructions and numerous errors
have resulted.
H. Pfund, supervisor of assess
ments, was authorized to investigate
the assessment returns of O'Brien,
Turtle Lake and Blackduck town
ships with a view to determine
whether assessments of land having
valuable timber had been returned
with exorbitant valuations. The
result of Mr. Pfund's findings .will be
reported to the tax commission.
During the meeting of the assessors
it was found that in Beltrami county,
4,339 individuals are assessed for
personal property.
Comparative figures showing the
increase or decrease over last year's
assessment will not be available for
ten days.
