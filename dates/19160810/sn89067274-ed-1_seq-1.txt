'Senators, William J. Stone and

D. P. MOORE, formerly of Mexico,
now of Webster Groves, St. Louis
County, has been nominated by the
Democrats of that county for County
Court Judge. This is a most im
portant office at this time, as a big
bond issue has been voted for good
roads. Mr. Moore is a conservative.
careful business man, and would see
that this money was expended eco
nomically, and that all of it went on
the roads. No better equipped man
for this important place could be se
lected.
THE Dmeocratic County Commit
tee of Audrain County sljowed wis
dom in selecting William Vivion, cf
1 Mexico, as chairman. Mr. Vivion is
fa live, progressive and industrious
I Democrat who believes in the thor
ough and careful organization of the
party. The Democratic party of Au
drain county should be thoroughly or
ganized, and every voter gotten out
at the November election. 1 Thats
the way to get results.
MEXICO had a dandy 2-inch rain
Monday night, which insures us the
biggest kind of corn crop for Audrain
county. The rain was general east
of Mexico and south, but west and
north it did not extend very far. A
good general rain over the whole
western country would be a fine thing
for the con crop. '
WHY is it some people want to
make a joke of politics and political
preferment? We better get down
to earnest work in Missouri this
year.
THERE are not very many Repub
licans in Audrain county, but when
they meet and get to pulling hair
you would think they had something
to fight over.
THE A. P. Green Brick Company
has an' ad. in today's Ledgfor for
labor. There is no excuse for any
Mexico man being out of work.
THERE could be one hundred miles
of oiled roads in Audrain if we were
willing to pay for it It takes real
money to make good, roads.
CLEAN up your alleys and hack
yards. That's the way to keep sweet
and clean.
HARRY STOCKS will make Mex
ico a most efficient Police Judge.
LET everybody push or pull and
nobodv knock. That's the way to
make a city.

8. The giant submarine, Bre
men, which was expected to band
on the United States coast some
time this week, has been re

craft.
