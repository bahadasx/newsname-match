Rare Old Coins.
Adam Kelner felt that he need
ed a little extra exercise last
Friday, so he walked from his
home near Saluvia to McConnells
burg, and said he intended to
walk the return trip. While in
the News office that day, he
showed us three rare old coins.
One is an old copper cent bearing
date of 1834. The second is al
so a copper cent, but bears the
legend "Millions for defense, but
not one cent for tribute," and is
dated 1S37. Mr. Kelner found
the latter piece while cutting
corn in a field near Hustontown
a lew years ago. The third coin
is also of copper, about the size
of a dime, and is very probably,
an Austrian coin, dropped by a
foreigner on the street in Cum
berland, Md., where Mr. Kelner
found it several years ago. The
two old copper . cents are about
the size of a silver quarter dollar.

Terrible Auto Accident.
The Mount Union Times last
week tells of a shocking automo
bile accident that occurred be
tween C and . 7 o'clock Sunday
evening, July 30th, nonr Allen
vine, Huntingdon county.
Samuel L. Smith with hi3 wife
who was Currance Bumgarner, a
daughter of the late Scolt Bum
garner of Belfast township, this
county, and their three children,
the youngest of whom was two
years of age, were driving along
the highway in Mr. Smith's auto
mobile. Ahead of Mr. Smith
and family, going in the same di
rection, was Harry Speck's auto
mobile driven by Harry's son-in-law,
Chester Simms, accompa
nied by the latter's son, Chester
Speck. Mr. Smith desired to
pass the Speck machine, and
made the attempt; but the road
was very narrow and Mr. Smith
ran his machine into a ditch,
struck an old tar barrel and tore
one wheel oil' his machine.
Mrs. Smith who is a hrgo, hca
vy woman, was thrown headlong
into a barbed wire fence. The
baby Harold was thrown out, his
side striking somo hard obstruc
tion, instantly killing him. Mrs.

through the forehead and hor
skull was f racturod. She receiv
ed a barbed wire cut which rip
ped her mouth wider on each
side. Another wire caught her
above the mouth and tore a cut
upward across the cheek bone,
toward the eyes. The biceps
muscles of one of her arni3 was
literally torn in shreds. She sus
tained two bad cuts in the lower
part of the abdomen, running up
ward in two directions.
Mr. Smith had an ugly bruise
near one of his eyes. His son
Clair and daughter Edith were
not hurt much. Mrs. Smith was
soon to become a mother, and her
condition is such that there is lit
tle hope for her recovery.

was killed in the accident Sam
uel Smith is a brother of ex
Sheriff Smith of Huntingdon
county.

TRIP THK01GII T1IEWESL
A. C. Kortoa Yritcs frcm Benedict, Ne
braska lri(!er Mi of August
tlic Second.
Dear Editor: Perhaps some
cf my friends in Fulton County
would like to know something
about my trip west. I left Mt
Dallas at 3:40 July 10th. Went
to Bedford, then over the Mid
land to Altoona, arriving there
at 6;50 p. m. took No. 5 to Pitts
burgh, arrived there 9:45 eastern
time. Left at nine p. m. Central
time for Chicago, got sleeper and
went to my berth and slept to
Fort Wayne, Ind. Arrived there
without a stop 320 miles. Got
there at 4:50 Tuer.day morning
and left 455. The next stop
was Engelwood, seven miles of
Chicago. Arrived at Chicago at
9:46 a. m. Tuesday.
The crops look fine through
Indiana and in Illinois. Corn
certainly is king. I left Chicago
10:05 a. m. over the C. B. and Q.
R. R. crossed Mississippi river
at Burlington Iowa at 2:57 p. m.
Tne corn crop looks good through
Iowa. The wheat is a big crop
in thi3 state. It has to be seen
before you can grasp the great
ness of it. We passed on through
Iowa to Omaha. Part of Iowa
is broken and rough along the
railroad. We crossed the Miss
ouri river to Omaha, Neb., at
12:01 Wednesday morning, and
reached Lincoln at 1;50 a. m. Ju
ly 11th. I staid in-the depot till
daylight. Could not get a train
to Benedict until 11 o'clock. Took
a trolley to Havelock five miles
out from Lincoln, found my old
friend Fletcher Miller, and took
breakfast with him. As I had j
not slept any Tuesday night, I
went to bed and slept until 1:30. i
Spent the afternoon and night!
with him. Mrs. Miller is a daugh J
ter of the late Joseph Cornelius
of Tecumseh.
Wednesday forenoon I went
back to Lincoln, took the 11 o'
clock train to Benedict, 67 miles
farther west where my brother-in-law
George Keith lives. Found
them all well. July 22nd Keith,
his wife, and I went to Loop
City, Neb., to visit their son-in-law
and daughter, Mr. and Mrs.
Plants. While .there J found
Mr. Taylor Gibson vfho used to
live in Everett. I had a very
nice visit with him. The corn
and wheat crops are extra in
Nebraska. Wheat yields 20 to
..'I. 4.
.'-.V.
sr.
40 bushels per acre. Oats are
good. They thresh a lot of wheat
, and oats put of the shock. They
have from' eight to ten teams
hauling to the machine. They
will drive a team on each side of
the machine, a man on each wag'
on pitching the bundles into the
machine. It cuts the band, feeds
itsself, threshes, cleans, weighs,
j and puts it in the wagon box
ready to haul to the elevator at
the rate of three bushels per
minute. Some may say fish story
but it is an honest fact for I
timed it several times, and oats
five to seven bushels per minute.
I will close for fear of the waste
basket.

tracked by foot prints and feath
ers back through the Washa

JULY HONOR ROLL.
Names of New Subscribers and Others
Who Paid Subscription During
the Month of July.
The months come and go with
such rapidity that it keeps one
busy to keep pace in the race
with Time. This list was due to
be published last week, but it
was forgotten. If you have paid
subscription recently and your
name is not in this list it is be
cause you have paid since the
lust day of July. Your name, in
that case will appear in the Au
gust list to be published in the
first week in September, unless
we forget it like we did this time.
An old colored preacher forgot
his sermon. He justified himself
by telling his congregation that
forgetfulness had run through
the human race from early bible
times; "for you know," said he,
that Adam "forgat," Seth, and
Seth "forgat" Enos, and Enos
"forgat" Cainan." O yes, bied
dern we are all forgetful 'crit
ters.'" The expenses of the newspaper
publishers go on in hot weather
just the same as at other times,
and he appreciates the money
that comes in at that time.
Look at the label on your pa
per. If you are paid up, or in
advance, you have cause for self
congratulation. If you are be
hind, do not put off squaring up
the account and paying a year
in advance. Do not think that
because it is only a dollar or two
that the publisher can get along
as well without it. Not so. With
the constantly advancing cost of
paper, ink, type, labor, and ev
erything else that enters into the
cost of production of newspapers
the publisher needs every dollar,
and needs it bad. The subscrip
tion price of dollar newspapers
all over the country is being
changed from $1.00 to $1.50.
Many of the City Dailies have
changed from one cent to two
cents a copy, and it i3 only a
question of a short time when the
Fulton County News will be
obliged to follow in the footsteps
of the Bedford papers, the Ev
erett papers, the Mount Union
Times, and dozens of other pa
pers, and go from a dollar, to a
dollar and a half a year.

THE IMCItOSCOi'Ii.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
No single invention 'ha"s made
possible greater saving of human
life than the microscope. Its or
igin dates back to antiquity.
There is every reason to believe
that the ancients had some knowl
edge of the use of the single
lens. The compound microscope
was probably invented shortly
after the middle ages. The Ital
ians and the Dutch both claim
the discovery.
These ancient microscope, were
very crude instruments compared
with those of to-day. They were,
however, sufficiently powerful to
reveal myriads of living things
in the clear atmosphere as well
as in a clear tumbler of water,
but they left us to imagine a great
unseen living world beyond the
power of the new instrument,
and that is even so to-day with
our most improved microscopes.
In the hands of scientists the
microscope ha3 revealed from
time to time a teeming life of
bacteria everywhere present.
Some of these minute organisms
are the friends and some the
deadly foes of man. Vegetable,
and, indirectly, animal life, de
pends upon their work.
Typhoid fever, tuberculosis,
typhus fever, tetanus, and other
diseases are the result of certain
of these bacteria which can only
be seen by the aid of the micro
scope. There is evidence, but as
yet no positive proof, that they
are responsible for many other
diseases, the aetiology of which
is yet unknown.
An army of scientific workers '
is to-day occupied in the study of
bacteriology for the purpose of
discovering the organisms that
produce the different diseases,
and then to push on with the idea
of discovering that which would
produce immunity or cure. Thi3
work is vital to the welfare of
humanity indeed it is that which
forms the foundation of prepar
edness. There is a constant warfare be
tween these little single celled
organisms and man. The bac
teria have the advantage of re
producing themselves in untold
numbers and of adapting them
selves to different environments,
and when the conditions surround
ing them suit their existence they
produce great epidemics of dis
eases that man is unable to re
sist. The fight is an interesting
one as man has already discover
ed how to combat successfully
many diseases which for centur
ies baflled the skill of science.
