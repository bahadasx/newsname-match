headquarters of tht organization in
the First Stat liank building Mon
day nlfht, initiatory step toward
making plana for the livestock exhi

October were taken, and these plans
are to be on an extended scale, it
being the intention not only of the
directors but of Secretary Weather
ly, to conceive the idea for the ex
hibition, to make it the biggest thing
of its character ever undertaken in
Mississippi.
It is the desire of the officials of
the Civic Chamber to awaken as
much local interest as possible in the
undertaking, and with that end in
view a meeting of the stock growers
was held last night. Other similar
meetings will follow, and the pro
moters hope by this means to arouse
interest to the highest pitch.
Two industrial enterprises, a han
die factory and a concern manufac
turing automobile spokes, have made
the Civic Chamber propositions
looking towards the establishment of
plants in Columbus, and at the meet
ing Monday night the committee on
new industries was authorized to
enter into negotiations with the man
agers of the two concerns with the
view of indwin;; them to locate j
r plants here. ,r., ,
Secretary Weatherly reported that
the Civic Chamber had rendered ev
ery possible assistance in organizing
the Girbi' Canning Club at Mount
Vernon, and stated that the club is
starting out with a good membership
and with the most flattering pros
pecs. Dr. J.' W. Lipscomb president of
the organization, was not present,
and the meeting was presided over
by Mr. Irvin Kaufman.
The municipal council recently
passed an ordinance making it man

Chancery Clerk B. A. Lincoln is in
receipt of a letter from the congress
man in which he states that Lowndes
county will participate in the distri
bution of the $540,000 appropriated
for the relief of those in distress.
Hay growers in this section have
experienced much difficulty of find
ing a satisfactory method of curing
their product, and Dr. W. W. West
moreland, who wrote to an exper
ienced hay grower for advice, has
received a letter advising him to
place a little salt in the middle of
each bale when it is packed. The
Pennsylvanian declares that this will
prevent the hay from heating, mold
ing or mildewing, and the "salt cure"
will be given a thorough test by local
growers.
Master Willie H. Woods, Jr., who
has been seriously ill for some time

Academy, came very near transform
ing the school into a religious assem
blage when, at the close of his re
marks, he called upon those in at
tendance to sing an old-time negro
melody., The response was immed
iate, and the teachers and embyonic
teachers sang "The Old Time Relig
ion is Good Enough for Me," with
the spirit and feeling that only de
scendants of Ham can put into mus
ic, their 'voices having resounded
through the building and awakened
euphonious echoes in the surround
ing neighborhood.
The subject selected by Senator
Stribling was: "Some Important
Common School Laws Enacted at
the Recent Session of the Legisla
aure," and he not only explained
fully the benefits to be derived from
these laws but complimented his
hearers and members of the negro
race generally upon the progress
which they are making along edu

It was found that most of the chil

listrict, which includes Columbus,
and the number in this district is
now about up to the standurd set in
1912. In outlying precincts, how
ever, the count brought no material
increase, and, according to the offic
ial records, the total number of edu-
cable children within the borders of
the county in about 2,200 less than
when the last quadrennial enumera
tion was made. This is a source of
chagrin and regret to local officials,

WRT1S
LOCAL "JETS" WITH YARNS
NOTED CONFEDERATE SCOUT
AND SHARPSHOOTER VISITS
COLUMBUS.
Notable among the vistors to Co
lumbus Monday was Major Lamar
Fontaine, of Marks, Miss., the well
known Confederate officer who re
cently came into prominence again
through his application for a com
mission in the brigade which Col.
Theodore Roosevelt declared it was
his intention to raise for service on
the Mexican bonier.
This grand old man, who is now
87 years old, has had experiences in
this life which few men undergo,
and while here delighted old veter
ans who gathered around him with
tales of battle fbld and frontier. In
addition to being a sharpshooter of
far more than ordinary prowess he
is a graduate of schools of both med
icine and civil engineering, and
while here told a most interesting
story regarding a survey he once
made of the historic city of Jerusa
lem. He also declared, without the
b'ink of an eye that he once killei'
twenty Federal soldiers in about as
tnany minutes, nnd related a number
.f other equally thrilling occur
! nces.
Although past the four-score
irark Major Fontaine is still hnl
t-nd hearty and declares that ht i
now as good in every way as he w.n
KiH a century ago. While here the
distinguished scout and recounter
was the guest of Mr. V. R. Simms at
the Gilmer Hotel, and in registering
at that hostelery performed the us
ual stunt of writing his autograph
on the thinly inked line which marks
the division of spaces in which two
ordinary visitors usually write tht-ir
names. The writing was so small as
to be invisible to the necked eye, but
when examined through a magnify
ing glass each letter showed up clear
and plain. Major Fontaine was en
route to the mountains of North
Carolina, where he goes to spend
the remainder of the summer.
