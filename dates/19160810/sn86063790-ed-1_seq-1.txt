MYSTERIOUS SHIP SEEN.
Stranger Playing Searclilight on
Charleston.
Mystery surrounds the source of
searchlight rays that played on the
harbor entrance and Sullivan's Island
Saturday night, the rays coming
apparently from the open sea.
The most probable explanation of the'
origin of the blinding flashes is that
an allied cruiser was off the harbor
entrance keeping an eye open for the
possible appearance in this vicinity
of the submarine Bremen. A week
or so ago about 9 o'clock in the evening,
persons on the Battery noted
searchlight rays flashing toward all j
points of the compass and apparent-1
ly coming from the vicinity of the;
Isle of Palms. It was afterward j
learned that the government searchlight
op Sullivan's Island was not

that the searchlight on the
submarine at the Isle of Palms is not
powerful enough to be seen from the
city. Very evident, it is, that some
ship not far at sea, is keeping Charleston
harbor under surveillance.?

MANNING IS CONFIDENT.
Pleased With Campaign So Far, and
Believes He Will Be Reelected.
Columbia, August 3.?"I am very
much pleased with the progress of
the campaign and am confident of
my reelection," said Governor Manning
here Tuesday before leaving for
Sumter to begin the sixth week swing
around the State. Governor Manning
is bearing up well under the incessant
strain of campaigning, is
very enthusiastic over the support
that he has found in every part of
South Carolina and is thoroughly optimistic
over his chances of serving
the people a second term as their
executive.
"It is a campaign that is worth
fighting," emphatically continued the
governor; "there is no place in it for
compromise or for a neutral position.
The issues are as closely defined
as they were in 1914. The main
question is simply whether the law
shall continue to be enforced and respect
for the law upheld on the plane
to which it has been restored in the
past year and a half, or whether the
verdicts of the juries and the decrees
of the courts shall be set aside.
"Besides this there is the improvement
in conditions of labor to be carried
on; the education of our boys
and girls to be continued along tin.
line already mapped out; and the
welfare of the unfortunates in thfe
State Hospital for the Insane to be
safeguarded with sympathy, intelligence
and care. For all these things
I stand.
"Those who would violate the law
will vote against me, those who oppose
the legislation I have recommended
and signed for labor's better
ment will vote against me; those who
oppose better education for the children
of the State will vote against
me?and they will be wise to do so,
for these things to my mind are fundamental
and I will not compromise
tljem.
"But the course of the campaign
has already shown that these persons
are in the minority; that they
do not and cannot control the State; j
the cause of progress in law enforcement
and education will go forward.
This cause, which was my platform
two years ago and is my platform
now, is becoming each day more and
more a fixed policy demanded by the
level-headed masses of the people."

The time of departure of the 2n

Only Two Candidates to Be Consideri
ed, Says B. Frank McLeod.
v'l
Charleston, August 3.?"Because
of the sharply drawn lines, definite
a and unequivocal, on public questions
stirring the State of South Carolina
today, I believe that only two candi,
dates for governor?the incumbent,
Richard I. Manning, and Cole L.
Blease?are to be considered," said
B. Frank McLeod, president of the
Charleston Chamber of Commerce,
. today. ^
"Particularly is'this so in the lowfc
country," continued the Charleston
b business man, "where the people consider
that a neutral position is not
Q the proper attitude to take towards
^ great and growing questions of the
hour, questions that are constantly
finding reiteration in the minds of
South Carolinians. Manning and
Blease have come out boldly and emphatically
on pointedly cleaved issiipq
and thpv arp thp nnps that arp
n being given grave consideration in
e the coming primary. Being in daily,
intimate touch with Charleston coun''
ty I am satisfied that Governor ManL"
ning will receive the perponderating
consideration of the anti-Blease sen-,
timent at the polls; and being familiar
with the political sentiment in
* other parts of the low-country I am
satisfied that the Sumter candidate ,
1# will receive enough votes in this section
to give him a majority in the
x first primary over the four other
gubernatorial candidates?if not a
majority, then a tremendous plurality.
I make this statement after care- *
ful consideration and a close scruti5t
ny of this section of the State."
1* Mr. McLeod said that he is firmly
5t of the belief that the people of South
,x Carolina want all the laws of the
x State enforced impartially, and that,
in this respect, the people have con
lidence in uovernor Manning ior me
i- splendid success that he hsfa made
t- in the enforcement of the law and
*s the maintaining of order throughout
the commonwealth.
> "Further, I am of the unqualified
opinion," continued Mr. McLeod, . ....
-r "that the people believe in the pro- ^
0 motion of education in the public
'e schools; believe that the officials uj
te should do all in their power to see
i. that the laboring man gets a 'square '
3t deal;' believe that every comfort poste
sible and tender care should be given
n the unfortunate patients in the State
h Hospital for the Insane; believe that
n the verdicts of the juries and the det
crees of the courts should be respect- > ;&
le ed; believe that agriculture should
be taught in the common schools;
d and believing these things and havi>
ing the knowledge that Governor
le Manning stands for all these views,
g they are going to support him at the
>y polls and stamp their approval on
3- his administration by reelecting him
i- for a second term. ^
;o Expressions like those from the
7-, president of the Charleston Chamber
is of Commerce are being voiced in
every section of the low country and
d the popularity of Gov. Manning is
is I constantly increasing and many who
ie | have not supported him are coming , ^
d i over to his side?knowing that he
"S stands for concrete issues and will
d be unswerving in the fulfillment of
is his pledges. # . >3
Tribute Paid Gov. Manning.
t Georgetown, August 4.?One of
n the smallest crowds of the campaign . j
d season greeted the candidates for
State offices here today. Not more
than two hundred voters attended
the meeting, and they were largely of
d the undemonstrative type. All speak'
ers were well received, but there was
^ little animated enthusiasm. Gover^
nor Manning was easily the favorite,
he receiving as many flowers as three
assistants could bear in automobiles.
The floral tributes were borne to the
. stage by a group of little boys and
r girls, who took up twenty-five
' bunches of flowers. Seasoned cam)l
paigners regarded it as the most eloquent
tribute ever paid a candidate -4
e in South Carolina.
LS j these officers will go an adjutant, a
e| medical officer, a sanitary sq,uad, and
e j an officer of the supply company.
I Lieut. Harrison will be the medical
. j
Ll officer with the first section, Cdpt.
ir Schaver with the second, and Major
e Jervey with the third. Lieut. Watkins
will be the supply officer with
the first section, Lieut. Mazyck with
5" the second, and Capt. Doyle with the
e third. Companies I, K, L and M go
2 in the first section; companies E, F,
