Georgia Mansfield and Miss Eliza
beth Hileman of Homer attended
the Chautauqua Saturday afternoon.
....Jeff Taylor of Emerson, and
Heinie Wagner, of the Homer Star,
made this office a fraternal call
Thursday .... A rumor has been cir
culated that the Chieftain has been
sold to R. J. Taylor of the Emerson
Enterprise. That the rumor has
gone to the majority of the sur
rounding towns seems rather
strange since we know nothing of
any such change. Mr. Taylor was
in Winnebago one day last week
looking over the Chieftain plant.
We leased the. Chief tain and expect
to i run it at least until our lease
rvfna out. In this connection we
wish to make amends for an uniust
suspicion which we had concerning
this same deal. We understand a
certain man was trying to change
the management of the Chieftain
for political reasons. We know
this was untrue and we wish to rec
tify our error as much as possible.
Valuation Less, But
Taxes No Higher
Seattle, Wash., Spokesman - Re
view, Aug. 1, 191G: While the ad
justment of values in the county
clipped $8,000,000 from the assessed
valuation, County Commissioner Jo
seph Bishop, who has been studying
expenses under prohibition, declared
yesterday that the tax levy will not
be increased this fall.
Commissioner Bishop found in his
investigation that there is but 111 in
mates in the county poorfarm as
compared to 154 a year ago. He
cites that institution as operated at
a big saving under prohibition.
He declares that the jail, sheriff's
office, courts and other offices are
maintained at a big saving under
prohibition, as shown by the data
at the office of the county auditor.
"When I say that there will be no
increase in the tax levy this year I
am speaking for the county, and
know that we will not ue onngeu to
increase our levy," said Commiss
ioner Bishop. "Prohibition has cut
the cost already, and it can be pre
dicted it will work a greater saving
to the county next year.
The jail has fewer prisoners, the
noorfarm fewer inmates, and the
courts have less crimnal work. We
are now inside the appropriation,
while last year the county faced a
beficit at the end of the year.
The fact the assessor has reduced
the assessed valuations $8,000,000
means we must use care in fixing the
levy, but we will be able to let it
stand without an increase.
While the county auditor's force
has not completed the tabulations on
expenses for July, it is expected a
noticeable decrease in operating the
office of sheriff, prosecutor, the jail,
the poorfarm and courts will be
seen.
The prisoners in the county jail
yesterday were 45. July 31, 1915,
there were 150.
Demands for county charity are
loss than last year at the end of July,
according to County Charity Com
missioner H. W. Arvin.

Hughes Points the Way
The speech of the Republican can
dlilate for President wits a keynote

moment as to just wlint ho meant by
overythluc ho said.
His nihlrcss wns comprehensive, log
ical, clear mid nil sunlctent for the
occasion. There can be no dispute
us to this. Plainly Mr. Hughes Is a
muu who "knows what he wants when
lie wants It," nnd It Is tho opinion
of political authorities who heard him
and who have since rend his remarks
thut he knows, also, how to get It.
It was Incumbent upon tho Repub
lican candidate to confine the scope
of his remarks to the limitations of
the occasion, but his crushing analy
sis of the shortcomings of the pres
ent administration of the government
Is merely on earnest of what the tono
nnd the contents of his speeches will
he when he gets on the stump.
At ' inegle Hall Mr. Hughes ad
renal to every general question thnt
Is apt u be a serious Issue In the
campaign and In language thnt will
be absolutely clear to every man or
woman uble to rend he stated his
opinions, his convictions and his pur
poses. On the stump ho will argue
those points In detail. As nn orator
he Is eloquent, his personality attrac
tive and his mnrshnlllng of facts so
cohesive that he holds IiIb auQIencc
to the end. He makes It easy for
them to follow him and his points
nre not lost.
Thcro was nothing equivocal, noth
