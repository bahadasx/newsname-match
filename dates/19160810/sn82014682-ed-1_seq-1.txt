New York Physician Sees Little
Hope Abatement of Cases
r While Heat Lasts
Cold weather will check infantile
paralysis, probably nothing else.
This first-hand information was re
ceived by the Star-Bulletin from a
prominent New York City physician,
Dr. Charles L. Llndley, visiting here.
Dr. Lindley left New York before
the ravages of the dread disease
started, but has followed with profes
sional interest all newspaper ac
counts.
The visitor is at the Moana hotel
with Mrs. Llndley. . They will probab
ly leave for home in the Niagara.
They came in the Matsonla.
When Dr. Llndley was asked what
he knew about infantile paralysis he
said:
Very little, and that is about all
any physician - knows," either here or
abroad. So far as I know there is no
cure for it"
The doctor scouts a statement made
recently ty a Chicago physician, vis
iting here, that .possibly several
deaths of summer complaint from the
excessive heat had been credited to
Infantile paralysis In New York.
He says there can be no truth In
this statement as the symptoms' of
the two diseases are not at all simi
lar. "However, heat certainly spreads
the epidemic and aggravates Individ
ual cases," says the doctor, "and I
believe cold weMber will do much to
reduce the fatalities."
Dr. Lindley has read with interest
of the adrenalin remedy disco verea
by the Rockefeller Institute, but says
he . has heard of no -diminution in
deaths.
