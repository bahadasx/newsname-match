FOR CHEST
Editor of the Advertiser:?
Id a previous article 1
sir' d that Chesterfield should
be proud of the fact that her
High School is the only school in
the County that gives the State
High School diploma, which will
adroit the holder to the Freshman
class of any College in the
State, rcently, the writer was
in one of the larger towns of the
county, and heard a bright ambitious
girl of fifteen or sixteen,
say that she had finished her
home school of ten grades the
past year, and that she was coming
to Chesterfield to school this
year in order to get a diploma
from Chesterfield High School.
If the facts were generally
known and talked around the
county, there might be quite a
number of boys and girls, from
all parts of the county, who
would come to Chesterfield every
year to attend school. By
doing this, the great expense of
a Preparatory School is saved.
To all intents and unrposes the
geographical center of the county,
the center of legal und official
business, a commercial center,
why shouldn't Cheeterfield be
the educational center of the
county as well? The people of
unestertield should awake to a
realization of the value of her
possession?the best school in
the county?and take more interest
and pride in the school.
It has been the boast of England
for centuries that "Brittania
rules the waves." In England,
up to the Boer war, the
politicians and aristocrats could
play politics with the aruiy. A
man might be commissioned in
the English army because of tho
social standing of his family, regardless
of his lack of ability.
But even though politics, in a
sense controlled the army, this
was not true of the English Navy.
Every Englishman realized
that in time of danger, the Navy
would be the salvation of the
British nation, and politics were
taboo in the navv.
The schools of ' * erfield
hold the destinies of Jounty.

The boys and girls of to-day are
the men and women of tomorrow.
The fnture is in their hand9.
On the present generation rents
the solemn obligation and duty
to do every thing possible for
1 the good of the coming generation.
It we fail in equipping
them properly for the battle of
life, then we are not only failing
in our duty, but we are unfaithful
to our trust.
The Chesterfield High School
is one of the greatest possessions
of the town and the community,
and every Chesterfield heart
should beat with pride at its
possession. Each and every one
of us should lay aside petty
jealousies, and ill fellings, when
it comes to school matters. Every
man in the district should
take a deep interest in the
school, should realize that it is
partly his school, and advocate,
work for, and vote for any bond
issue which will benefit the
school in any way. The money
we pay out in taxes for educational
purposes cou.es back to
us ten-fold.
The complete course at Chesterfield
High School is equivalent
to the College education of
thirty or forty years ago. Some
of us of the preseut generation
did not have educational advantage,
but we should resolve
that no matter what happens
our children shall receive every
advantages possible. We should
not be satisfied that our school is
merely the best in the County,
but every man in the School District
should resolve that he will
not rest until the Chesterfield
High School i6 one of the very
best schoQls in the State; until
Chesterfield is known far and
near as a town and community
where educational 'advantages
are of first importance. That in
Chestorlield, regardless of personal
or political differences,
when it conies to school matters,
every man's shoulder is at the
wheel, and everyoue is ready at
any and all times to do his full
duty towards the school.

Allies Certain
To Win Victory
Gen. Joseph Joffre, generalissimo
of the French army and the
guiding spirit of the united army
of the entente allies, recently
received the Associated Press
correspondent and expressed belief
that the turning point of the
great conflict had been successfully
reached and passed and
that with the united action of
the entente allies on the many
fronts, they were pressing forura
r/1 /% f * 4* ? * rtrtlln
niaiu i>u unci uci lam umui
the German efforts and to an as
sured victory of the allies'1
armies.
JofTre is not only head of the
French army but also is in supreme
authority over the French,
British and Belgian forces on
the Western front and the
French, British and Servian
armies of half a million men
around Saloniki as well also as
being the supreme commander
in the united action by which
the allies are conducting simult
aneous campaigns in the Russian
1'p.lian, French and Balkan theatres
as part of one systematic
whole. It is this recent coordination
of the commands on the
many fronts that has permitted
Gen. Joffre to give full scope
to his military talent which
probally has been exorcised over
more men of the allied nations
t.liAM fivpr bpfnro hue f?llon
one military commander.
"I want to express my sati6faction
in meeting you gentlemen,
and through you to express
our feelings toward the
American people," Raid Gen.
Joffre, speaking in an easy conversational
tone. "A feeliug of
deep friendship lias always existed
between France and America
and it is particularly opportune
now, after Fiance has been
fighting for two years for the
ideals dear to both countries,
that this old friendship should
be renewed and strengthened."
Turning his attention to the
actual condition of the campaign
Gen. Joffre continued:
"Although the lighting is getting
more and more bitter, every
one recognizes in the complete
unity of the allies that destiny
has shaped its course and every
one can clearly see what the final
outcome is going to be. The
unity on all frouts is a great
characteristic of the campaign
now going on and the effort is
apparent in the constant pressure
011 all sides by the allies
who now have had time to form 1
their plans, thanks to the sacri- '
, (ices which the Freuch nation
has made at Verdun. We must
also pay full homage to the
splendid part our allies are taking.
The Russian effort has succeeded
in organizing and putting
forward larger uinl larger forces 1
of men, drawn from their apparently
inexhaustible soruces and
at the same time fully arming '
the masses. The splendid re- *
suits of their etForcs are shown
in what they have accomplished
in Qallicia and along the entire
Eastern front. Once more tin
chance has [alien to England to
show the vast extent of her resources.
both in men and material,
and the extent of her efforts
is shown in what has been
accomplished on the Somme
front. The Italians have had a
much harder task and a more
! limited sphere of action and you
| know how admirably they have
fulfilled their part. As for the
reorganized Servian army, it is
only just beginning to take its
full part in the war.
"If on the other side we consider
the condition of our enemy
we know for certain that
although they are fighting as
desperately as ever, they are
drawing on their last reserves.
Their game has been to transfer
heir reserves from one point to
another and from one front to
another but with the united action
of the allies on all fronts
our enemy now finds such a
course impossible.
"It is not for me to say how
long the struggle is going to last
but that really matters little.
We know the crash is coming
and you feel as well as we do
that we have reached and passed
the turning point. The fine
resistance of our troops at Verdun
has shattered the hopes of
the Germans and has turned the
scale, but still do not imagine
that there is a complete weakening
of the German effort on the
Western front. We know there
still are opposed to all our armies
on the Western front twothiids
of all the best fighting
forces that Germany can put in
the field.
Not Our Roy
Readers will call to mind the
newspaper stories that were
published recently regarding an
escapade of some of the soldier
boys at Camp Moore. Some of
them, going on a lark purloined
some watermelons and one boy
got sprinkled with birdshot.
Now it so happened that this
bov's eiven nam? in Hrwr nr?H fVi?
is also a boy soldier from this
section by the name of "Roy"
Melton at Oamp Moore. Therefore
it seems that someone with
a first-class imagination overlooked
the fact that the wounded
"Roy" was also named Kelly
and that he belonged to Company
"F," while Roy Melton is
in Company "I."
While this escapade, under ordinary
circumstances would be
treated lightly, Mr. I. R. Melton
father of Roy, feels that an effort
is being made to damage
his boy's reputation by this misrepresentation.
Mr. Melton exhibited in this
ollice a perfectly convincing letter
from Camp Moore showing
that "it was a boy uamed Roy
in Company "F", and not Roy
Melton in Company "1" who got
shot."
This letter went on to say tj^t
there are mauy false stories and
exaggerations going the rounds
about these boy6, many of them
without foundation.
We trust that this explanation
will be sulficient to quiet anv
one trying to injure the reputation
of this boy, if such a thing
is being clone.
Miss Mamie Simpson.
Miss Mamie Simpson, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. I. P. Simpson,
died at the home of her
parents on August 1st, after suffering
from typhoid fever for
ten weeks.
She died in her twenty fifth
year and leaves, beside" father
and mother, the following brothers
and sisters: Messrs, Will,
John, George, Zellie and Cyrus;
Mrs. James W. Knight, Mrs.
Lienry Sowell and Miss Loma
Simpson. The funeral service
was conducted by the Revs. El
kins, Lawson and White and the
interrmeut took place at the
f.emetory of the Babtist church
Plains, where she had been a
devoted member for a number
of years. The grave was banked
high with beautiful flowers,
ittesting the high esteem in
which she was held by her many
iriends in the community.
She bore her long illness with
beautiful Christian resignation,
expressing at times a desire to
recover so that she could be
about her duties in connection
with her church and Sunday
school where she was faithful
worker.
She was universally loved in
her community and the example
set by her luring her life of usefulness
and her patience in suffering
will be a blessing for a
long time to come. J. W. K.
