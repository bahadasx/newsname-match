corn crop i3 finer this year than

and expects to put in fifty more
as oon as possible.
Mr. Metculf brings the inter
esting .information that the
wheat acreage in Curry County
next year will be from one-third
to one-half greater than it was
tins year. This is stood news to
the people ofClovit and Curty
County. Providing it is an aver
age season this means th.it the
wheat crop of the county next
year will be from 600,000 to 800,
000 bushels, At the present
price of wheat, this will mean
SANTA FE MIXED TRAIN
DITCHED MONDAY NIGHT
Ran Into Washout. Engine and Cars Turned Over.
Engineer Injured and Passengers Shaken Up.
The South bound Santa Fe ac
commodation freight train went
into the ditch at Lakewood, a
station between Roswell and
CurWbad, Monday night at 10:55,
The engine and three freight
cars were turned completely
over.
The fireman sustained painful
injuries and several of the pas
sengers were badly shaken up
aid the remainder as badly
frightened.
ihe wreck was caused by a
wash-out of the road bed. A
heavy rain storm had prevailed
in tbat section of the country all
day Monday and the tracks in
several places were flooded with
tveral inches of water.
The wrecking crewa of Clovis
and Amarillo were called out and
proceeded to the scene of the

tendence o f Superintendent

CURRY
WHEAT ACREAGE
to One-half Greater
Season.
$600,000 to $800,000 to Curry
County from one crop..
This has been the dry est year
ever knon in Curry County,
but the wheat crop panned out
bjtter than was expected in the
early spring:. Wheat is- the sal
vation of this country. There is
more money in it than any other
crop that can be raised here and
the farmers are just beginning
to realize it. The crop has never
been a failure. Think of a new
country like this where 10 to 30
bushels of wheat can be raised
in a dry year on land that can be
bought from $10 to $15 per acre.
We doubt if it can be duplicated
anywhere in the United States,
except here in Curry County.
They call the Dakotas a wheat
country, yet the average yields
are no greater than right here
in Eastern New Mexico, and
lands there tell from $50 to $75
per acre.
Amarillo Boosters
Visit Clovis
The Amarilto club for city De
velopment came to Clovis in full
force, Wednesday and spent an
hour interviewing our business
men and viewing the city. The
boosters are traveling on a
special train consisting of two
ordinary coaches and three pull
mans, Heretofore the club con
sidered that they were "going
some" when they visited towns
in their patronising: territory in
a motor car. This evolution
from a string of "tin henrys"
to a special train of palatial
"Kivered" cars, is a good indi
cation that Amarillo is prosper
ing. The boosters took dinner at
the Harvey House, and led by a
moat excellent band, paraded
the principal streets and after
ward devoted their time to cir
culating publicity literature and
making acquaintances ameng
Clovis people.
Quite a number of business
men met them on their arrival at
12:25 and gave them a farewell
at 1.25. The party went from
here to Roiwell and returned to
this city at 5:30 a. m. and went
to Lubbock Texas to wake up
that city.
Reception to Pastor
A reception was tendered Rev.
Earle DuLaney, the new Baptist
minister, Tuesday night at the
Baptist church, and there was a
large attendance. Rev. Du
Laney made a pleasing address
which was well received by the
audience. Refreshments of ice
cream and cake were served by
the young ladies of the church.
A splendid musical program was
rendered.

WORKING
TO GET VOTES
is just "a wee bit" behind Miss
Wizksnow. Miss Doyle has for
gotten the words "can't" and
"fail" and she is in this cam
paign for a successful finish.
"Successful Finish" to Miss
Doyle means that piano, means
FIRST HONORS. It's a "battle
royal" with these two excellent
young ladies until the last second
of the contest.
Miss Carrie Blassingame has
done excellent work, as well as
some others in this campaign.
Miss Blassingame comes third,
and take it from us, she is a
worker worthwhile, and a few
long term subscriptions could
easily turn the tide in her f ivor,
and give her the piano. Fact is,
a few long term subscriptions
would probably "cinch" the
piano for any young lady in the
campaign.
Owing, to the change in day of
publication, and owing to the
fact that the campaign manager
hw n ripr to fill in Oklahoma in
a few days, tnis campaign will
clobe one day easier than first
announced. Don't forget this.
Instead of closing at 7 p. m.

WHAT CURRY COUNTY BOYS
AND GIRLS ARE DOING
This County Leads In Agricultural Club Work Out
side of Counties with Paid Agents.
The following which appeared
in the New Mexico Farmer, a
publication issued by the College
of Agriculture and Mechanic
Arts, written by the State Lead
er, is very flattering to the boys
and girls of 'Jurry County and
should encourage the formation
of clubs all over the county.
"Outside of the Counties with
paid agents in agricultural ex
tension work. Curry County
leads the I i t in point of Club en
rollment and ranks among the
bett in actual Club work. The
first Club member to become a
leader in Club work lives in the
Pleasant Hill neighborhood of
Curry County. As a Club mem
ber he becomes of age this year.
Not long since the State Lead
er visited the Clubs on the Plains
and found them working nicely.
Both Locust Grove and Pleasant
Hill groups are in the race for
Mr. Boyce's $4,000.00 Club
house. The way they are work
ing in these two communities
shows that they mean business.
With their Club work they
weave in the social features that
make their gatherings a source
of pleasure and enjoyment. The
girls' Cooking Club showed us,
in a practical way, their skill in
cake baking. To this they added
ice-cream and plenty of good
cheer, which gave a splendid
relish to the refreshments.
Not only is the Club member
NEW HOMESTEAD LAW
IS
Homesteaders Can File on Government Lands Re
gardless of Location.
A new homestead law is now
in effect, which will be good
news to many farmers and stock
raisers of Curry County. Home
steaders can now file on addition
al land without it being contigu
ous to the original entry.
Circular No. 485, explaining
the provisions of the Enlarged
Homestead Act, amended under
the act of congiess of July 3,
1016. has been issued to the
registers and receivers of United
States land offices in all states
including within their bordor
lands available for entry,
Tne original act provided for
entry on 100 acres and in 1909
this act was amended by the
passage of an act providing for
the futher entry by applicant
for appropriation of additional
lands amounting to 160 arces,
whert such additional lands were
contiguous to the original home
stead making possible the ac
quistion by settlers of a tract
embracing 320 acres, of free
government land.
Under act of July 3, 1916, the
restriction limiting applicants to
filing on only such lands as were
contiguous to the original home
stead, has been removed and the
settler is now permitted to file
upon any additional lands, re
gardless of its location. The
ship interested and active but
the whole community turns out
to these follow-up meetings and
puts its stamp of approval on
the work by their presence.
One man stated that whenever
he had an opportunity to burn
some gasoline in the interest of
the Club work he was alwayn
ready. We learned that he had
risen at five o'clock on Monday
rrorning and had driven fifteen
miles to town to get ice for the
nine o'clock meeting. While he
was gone to town, his little
daughter, baked a cake for the
occasion, tho she is about five
years under the club age. The
Club spirit runs in the family.
There were seventy-five people
at this Monday morning Club
meeting right in the midst of
harvest time.
On Saturday before the Mon
day meeting. Locust Grove
turned out more than fifty strong
in spite of a counter attraction
in the adjoining neighborhood.
This is one of the fortunate com
munities where the Principal of
the school is a resident member
and a good Cluh leader. The
boys are taking the double
project of Crops and Pigs and
the girls are busy with Cooking
and Sewing.
It does one good to feel the
spirit of csoperation that is fre
quently found in country com
munities like these."
NOW IN EFFECT
previsions of the ast extend the
privilege of the settlers from
the government lands in one
state to those of any other. The
act makes possible the selection
of a single homestead of 160
acres in any locatien and the
further entry upon additional
lands in tracts of 40, 80 or 160
acres in different states provided
the land is properly designated.
Democratic Get
Together Day
There is an agitation for a
Get-Together-Day, of the demo
crats and it has been suggested
that the State Committee desig
nate a day fer such a meeting,
and August 12 would be a good
date. On that date the demo
trats of each precinct weuld
meet to exchange views, formu
late plans and take measures to
give the state a wise, honest
and economic government
