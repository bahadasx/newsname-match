Chautauqua
The Indians of New York State gave the name to
Lake Chautauqua. This is one of the highest lakes in
the world being 6,ooo feet above the surface of Lake
Erie, which is only a few miles away. This was a famous
place for camp meetings, and Bishop John Vincent made
it a gathering place for summer assemblies, where music,
popular education, and inspiring addresses made the
hours pleasant and profitable.
The "Chautauqua idea" has been copied from one
end of the Country to the other, and now every up-to-date
American expects to spend several days and nights with
his family under a Chautauqua tent.
The Radcliffe Chautauqua, which is in.Berea this
year, is doing a splendid piece, of work for Eastern Ken
tucky. They are holding Chautauquas in many places
where the word had not. been heard. Everywhere they
are leaving a good impression The editor has recently
visited several towns where this Chautauqua has been in
session, and in every case the people have better things
to think about and talk about, neighbors are more ready
to join together, and already they are laying their plans
to have a bigger Chautauqua next year.
The Courthouse
Why is it we build fine courthouses and then treat
them like stables and hog-pens ?
As you approach a county-seat you count the spires
of its churches and mark the dome of th courthouse.
As you enter the town you are stuck by the imposing pil
lars, and it is evidentthat somebody has paid a good deal
of money for the erection of the temple of justice.
The people who do business in the courthouse are
highly paid officials the judges, the recorders, and the
county officers, on whom our peace and welfare largely
depend. But when you enter the yard you find it clutter
ed with newspapers, tin cans and empty bottles, and
when you ascend the steps you are likely to slip down in
the tobacco juice.

Road Improvements
By Prof. John F. Smith
Tka Making of the Road
After the road ia located thfn
cornea the road-building. Like
grain elevator, a great bridge or a
cily office building a road lasts lon
ger and gives better satisfaction
when it has a good foundation. The
plan usually followed in building a
macadamized road is t dig out the
road bed to a depth of a foot or
more and to a width of from eight to
twenty feet sixteen feet being a good
average. The bed is shaped so as to
leave the highest part along a line in
the middle from which the sides
slope away about one and one-half
inch to the foot until the aide
ditches are reached. This is then
filled with eight or len inches of
crushed stone which is wet and rol
led with a heavy steam roller. Next,
the surface Is covered with about
two inches of fine crushed stone cal
led screenings, and this is wet and
rolled until the whole mass becomes
solid.
If the road Is to be made of gravel,
the bed should be dug out as before,
filled with broken stones, and the
gravel should be spread over the
surface. Roll thoroughly if pos
sible. But if a roller is not at hand
the gravel should be kept raked in
to the ruts until it is well packed
by passing wagons.
If the road runs thru a sandy
eouotry where little or no metal
Is available the bed should be
thrown up a foot or two higher
than the land on either side and the
surface should be sloped as usual
and covered with sand mixed with
clay. This will soon harden, and if
kept properly dragged will turn the

water from the surface and support
the ordinary traffic that passes over
it.
If only dirt is to be used, the bed
should be thrown up as in the case
of the sand road and the slant should
be made just the same, one and a
half inch to the foot. Rocks and
sticks should be reniovetl from the
surface and it should be dragged
thoroughly with a King's split-log
drag. This will make the surface
smooth and pack it so it will turn
water and carry the traffic.
Drainage
The worse enemy of good roads is
water. If it stands on the surface,
runs in the ruts, flows across it, or
seeps under it, serious results are
liable to follow. If the road runs
along a ridge where natural drain
age is good it is easy enough to pro
tect it fruin damaging rains. It is
done by proper ditching and sum
facing. Hut if it runs across low,
marshy meadow-land, or along a
stream subject to frequent overflows,
or around a steep hillside the prob
lem of drainage becomes a serious
one.
As you have learned alrady the
surface of the dirt road, or of any
kind for that matter, should be rais
ed considerably above the land on
either side in order to have the pro
per slant and be above the water
that runs or stands in the ditches
during heavy rains. On both sides
ditches should be cut wide enough
to carry the water, and from these
at frequent Intervals other ditches
should be cut to lead "-the water
away. Culverts should be built at

Oil Flowing From Spring
What is puzzling oil men more
than any recent developments in the
field is a report from the Sweet
Lick section to the effect that sev
eral days ago a spring on the
mountainside on the Bud Rawlins
farm, began running crude oil and
has since slightly increased each
day, until now it is estimated that
four or five barrels escape in this
way daily. This pheomenon can
only be accounted for by those who
have studied it, by the drilling of
a well on the top of the mountain
nearby, and the drill coming in con
tact with the spring stream, thus
allowing oil rising in the well to
escape through the water passage.
Ol men say it is a new one on them
and can only account for it in the
above manner.

Congress, the incumbent, Hon. Har

votes and carried every precinct ex
cept Berea in which there was a tie
vote. His majority in the district is
about six thousand.
Judge Baxter wins his race with
ease and will carry the banner suc
cessfully next November. His major
ity over his opponent in the County is
1110, one of the largest ever given a
man for this office. Hej"arried every

New York, Aug. 8. The street rail

tulated. The result Is an overwhelm
ing victory for the men.

WORLD HEWS
The submarine merchantman, the
Deutschland, has, to all appearances,
succeeded in getting into the open
sea on her way back to Germany.
Before her final dash her captain and
crew gave a rousing cheer for the
United States and Americans.
The Germans and Austrians are
massing their troops and guns for a
great counter-attack to prevent the
Russian drivo on Lemberg and Ko
vel. Leading generals are in con
trol, including Von Hindenburg, Von
Mackenson and the Arch Duke. It
is believed that the crisis of the
war on the Eastern frontier is near
at band.
The English, have made further
gains on the Western frontier in the
region of the 8otnm. The advance
has not been great in distance but
the line has been straightened out
and put in better condition for a
furthra- advance against the Ger
mans. 1 The execution of Sir Roger Case
'ment for treason occurred during
the week. He wis the leader in aa
unsuccessful Irish Rebellion in
which Germany was also to aid.
The high standing and character of
the man and the urgent requests
for pardon had no effect on the
course of English justice.
The Germans are trying to bring
about a change so that the food
stuffs produced in the territory
conquered by Germany may be used '
in any part of the Empire and not,
as has been the case up to this time,
by the people of the conquered ter
ritory. The feeling toward the
American Food Commission on the
part of Germany is not cordial be
cause they oppose this.
A large force of Turks attacked the
English in the region of the Suez
Canal. The Turks were repulsed
with much loss of life. The English
control of the canal is still supreme.
The British government agrees to
the restrictions which the United
State wishes to be placed on the
Black List of every firm in our
country. This removes the grounds
for a serious disagreement be
tween England and the United
States.
