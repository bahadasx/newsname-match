. HUGHES ATTACKS 1
MINISTRATION
LACKING OF POLICY SAYS REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE.
ON FIRST SPEAKING TRIP
Assails Foreign Course and Mexican
Proflram of President Wilson?Diplomatic
Appointments Are Criticized.
Detroit. Mich.?Charles E. HuRTies
in the first set speech of his trans-continental
trip assailed the administra- {
Hon viHornnwlv for Its foreign nolicv.
its Mexican policy, for appointing men
who he termed nexperieneed to diplomatic
posts and for what h9 charac- ;
terized as a "raid upon the civil service
of the United States."
"He kept us out of war," Mr.
Hughes said, referring to the president
and a Domoeratic slogan. "Yet
we seized Vera Cruz. That was war
?very ignoble war. And it was called
war over the bodies of those dead
soldiers; it was called a war of service.
"Talk about what is your policy.
"What is the president's policy?does
any one. know? Has the executive
ever had a policy for more than six
months on the Mexican question? I
repeat: Who knows today what the
policy of the administration will be
three months hence? The trouble is
that this administration has written
auch a record that no matter what it
says you do no know whether it
will stick to it.
"We have had an exhibition during
the past three years which I confess
fills me with a deep sense of shame.
I have not a particle of militaristic
spirit in my system, but if I am elected
presdent I will see to it that Amor- 1
lean rights in Mexico are respected."
Mr. Hughes assallod the administration's
course toward upholding AinerJcan
rights abroad during the Eurojl
poan war.
. ' When I say that T am an American
citizen," the nominee said, "I ought
to say the proudest thing that any
man can say in this world. But you
can't have that pride If American citizenry
Is a cheap thing. If It is not
worthy of protection this wide world
over. There is no man who could successfully
present to an American communty
the platform that an American
citizen's rights stop at the coast lino
and that heyond that American life Is
to be the prey of any marauder that
chooses to take it."

CAPT. HINSCH TELLS OF THE I
DEPARTURE OF THE SUBMARINE
DEUTSCHLAND.
Captain Who Directed Departure Says
Vessel Went Under the Water When
Only a Mile Inside The Three-Mile
Limit.
Norfolk, Va.?So far as Is known
hero the Deutschland is safely at sea <
on her way to Bremen after success- ; j
fully running through the patrol of j <
Allied cruisers off the Virginia capes, i (
| It is not believed the Deutschland 1 |
j experienced the slightest difficulty in j
i evading the erulsers. Captain Hinsch. i '
of the war-bound German liner Nec-j
; kar, who directed the departure of the 1
j submarine said that the underwater ; <
freighter passed unobserved within
one hundred yards of a United States
destroyer on neutrality duty about a
mile off the capes.
"When we came to a stop at a point
in the bay I sliall not disclose because

place again," said Captain Hinach,
"the pilot aboard the submarine was ,
taken off to the Thomas P. Tlmmons,
our tug. It was then about 5 o'clock
In the morning. The submarine was
submerged, so that her machinery and
pumps could be tested and the cargo
be trimmed, should It be necessary.
*Jhe went down in a deep hole in the
bay to a depth of 135 feet remaining
there for some time.
"When she came to the surface
again. Captain Koenig came up
through the conning towers and said
that everything was working perfectly.
That pleased us, I can tell you.
We had thought we might have to
rearrange some things, after it was
seen how the Deutschland worked in
salt water. The tests in the dock at
Baltimore were made In fesh water,
you know.
"The trial completed we started off ,
down the bay and when no traffic was
in sight the Deutschland took another
dive while running. She went down
until only a few inches of her peri- :
s<-ope was showing above the water.
Then I dropped behind to see at what
: distance the wake of the Deutschland
1 or the foam crest of the periscope
| could be seen. About 400 yards with
: glasses I could not see a thing.
"In the afternoon we started for (
I the capes and you know how the bet]
ter part of the trip was made. The
I destroyer was passed In the dark. As
j soon as tno men on the bridge sight-I
ed the lights of the Timmins they
watched us closely and looked all
around for the submarine which passed
them at a distance of only a hundred
yards. At the time the submaROGER
CASEMENT MET HIS
DEATH ON GALLOWS BRAVELY.
Last Utterance Was, "I Die For My
Country."
London.?With only two chaplains
and minor officials of the Government
j looking on, Roger Casement, once
knighted for his services to the Crown
while a Hritish Consul, was hanged ;
as a traitor in the Pentonville jail
here. The trap was sprung at one
minute after 9 o'clock and when a
single stroke of the prison bell announced
the gTim fact to a waiting
crowd outside only a chorus of cheers
and groans replied, while at one spot
a group of about ilO Irish women fell
on their knees and prayed for the
soul of their fellow countryman.
Casement, convicted of conspiring J
to cnuse an armed revolt in Ireland ,
, and with having sought German aid
to that end, met his death with calm
courage .according to witnesses, and j
his last utterance was, "I die for my j
country."
PASSENGER SHIP SUNK BY
SUBMARINE?MANY LOST. I
London.?The Italian mail steamer
Letimhro has been sunk by a sub !
marine and 2S survivors have arrived
at Malta, says a Router dispatch from I
that place. Two boatloads with sur- i
vivors also have arrived at Syracuse.
The Letimhro carried a crew of 57
and her passengers numbered 113. It
Is believed that a largo number of

Commissioners.
Washington.?Indications were that
President Wilson would appoint three j
commissioners within the next few
lays to meet a similar delegation already
selected by General Carranza to
undertake settlement of the international
differences arising from disturbed
conditions along the Mexican borlor.
In a note delivered to the state department
General Carranza named his
commissioners, but did not answer '
specifically the suggestion of the
Washington government for enlargement
of the powe.s of the commission.
It Is believed, however, that tho
reply is generally satisfactory to the
administration and that negotiations
will proceed without delay.
General Carranza says in his note
that the Mexican commissioners
'preferably" will discuss the three
points outlined in the Mexican communication
of July 11, which are
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico, the framing of a protocol to
rover future border operations, and an
Investigation of what interests have
promoted border raids. State Department
officials are understood to regard
this as at least leaving the way
npen for broader considerations such
iis they desire.
Carranza lias appointed to represent
liis government Licentiate Luis Cabrera.
