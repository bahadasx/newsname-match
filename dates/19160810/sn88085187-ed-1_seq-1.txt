GIRL PLUNGES FROM WINDOW
FLOOD TAKES TERRIBLE TOLL M THE SOUTH
JOHNSON OF
'DON'T' SORT
By GILSON GARDNER
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 10.-- Regardless of their party
names, all congressmen fall into two classes; those who serve the
people and those who don't.
Representative Albert Johnson of south west Washington Is in
the "don't ' class.
If anyone wanted Johnson's vote, he would not go to Johnson
and say, "The people ought to have this law."
The seeker of Johnson's vote would go to Jim .Mann or Joe
Cannon or any of the old party machine bouses.
Or they might even get over the party line and do a little quiet
trading with the democratic leaders who serve business instead of
voters.
If these members told Johnson lt would lie all right to vote for
the bill and Johnson felt that he could plausibly explain lt to his
district or that tlie district voters would never hear about lt. John
son would go along with the regular Cannon-Mann machine crowd.
Johnson's record—the votes he has cast and the speeches he
has made —show he is this kind of a. congressman. Nobody ever
heard of Johnson fathering a workman's compensation law, or head
ing a light to increase tlie tax on incomes.
He never came out for Crosser's land colonization bill, or Tav
enner's government ownership and operation of waterpower bill.
He never followed Hryan of Washington in his advocacy of gov
ernment ownership of railroads, or gave any sifpport to Davy-
Lewis' proposal for government ownership and operation of tele
graphs and telephones.
AGAINST "IDEALISTIC, RADICAL" BILLS
He is not that kind of a congressman. He is 'regular," "con
m servatlve," "safe and sane."
He is so conrervatlve that he can't see a scintilla of good in
socialism. He appears to believe that all people (like the social
ists), who try to put the Interest of the worker first, are enemies
of the public good and ought to be put down by force if necessary.
One of his specialties is running publicity against -socialism.
This anti-socialist propaganda, incidentally, he tries to glorify by
much waving of the Stars and Stripes.
Johnson liati little of that kind of patriotism which
ni.il.es him anxious to find v better way of evening up the
products of the toiler's toil, step-, towurd his end are
"Idealistic," "radical," "dangerous."
Johnson shows how he goes along 'with the majority of his
1 party in voting ac he did for such things as the 20-cent mileage
grab, and Spanish and Philippine war pensions.
He was against the tariff provisions for free wool, steel rails
and lower sugar duties.
In other words, he stands for the Payne-Aldhich Idea on the
■übject of the tariff.
Johnson's disposition to dodge is shown in answering "present,"
Instead of voting on the waterpower leasing bill, and the very im
portant emergency currency law. For reasons probably of pure
partisanship, Johnson voted against the creation of the marine gov
ernment Insurance bureau In the treasury department, created at
the outbreak of the European war, and which has proved one of
the most successful of governmental activities. Johnson failed in
the two sessions of the 63d congress to vote on the child labor bill.
VOTED FOR PORK BARREL MEASURE.
During his first term he voted for a bad amendment proposed
by Fitzgerald of New York (democrat) which would put in the
hands of the appropriations committee the right to fix salaries of
r fleers of the government.
This was a patronage and pork proposal by the notorious Tam
many leader, and Johnson had no excuse for supporting It. In the
same session he voted with the democratic machine leaders to dis-
Jlace District day (the day set apart for D. C. legislation) on June
. 1914.
At that time the calendar contained bills of great Importance,
such as the Buchanan bill to amend the building law to safeguard
the lives of workmen, and the Crosser bill providing for municipal
ownership of street railways in Washington.
To shelve these bills the democratic leaders displaced "Dis
trict day," and Johnson (republican) helped them do it.
He failed to vote on the question of strengthening the campaign
" publicity bill, and also on the question of providing the speaker and
the vice president automobiles at public expense.
He voted against the democratic tariff and currency bllU—both
party votes —but in favor of the Clayton Anti-Trust bill.
Out of 118 record roll calls in the house between Dec. 1, 1913,
and Aug. 25, 1914, Johnson failed to vote 19 times.
In the present session, few vital roll-calls have been had in the
house He voted for the pork barrel river and harbor grab bill,
and against the new revenue meaaure with its incrased taxation on
th Incomes of the rich.

II WHY MAIDS |
I LEAVE HOMEJ
By a Woman Reporter
The * * lii«li«'w * gainc'' of firing and hiring maids
lias become the serious problem or keeping one maid.
Housemaid! get higher pay now.
Once they're hired, they're hard to keep.
Often they quit for shop and store work at
■mailer wages.
Whyl
What's tlie matter?
What is the housemaid problem?
And what is its solution.
J was given orders to find out.
"Hut you won't be able to get to the bottom of
the situation by interviewing housewives, maids and
employment agencies,l said the editor. "You'll have
to get firsthand experience."
That could only mean getting a maid's job and
doing a maid's work.
So 1 quit being a reporter for a while and be
came a housemaid.
1 take pride in the fact that 1 am able to bold a
housemaid's job.
1 think the duties of a home are fundamentals
vxovy woman ought to know.
No Trick to Find Job
So I have learned to do all that makes up tlio
work of keeping house. 1 can clean, wash and iron;
cook, set a table and serve a meal. 1 know how a
house should look, and how to keep it looking that
way. And I know how much labor this requires and
what it is worth.
To get jobs was easy. The "Girls Wanted" col
umns were sufficient.
I got not one job, but three. At them I was to
be paid $10, $(i and 05.00 a week, respectively.
The $10 place I took first.
It was noon when I knocked at the back screen
door of the first house. The woman who came to
the door still was wearing at that late hour her
soiled blue negligee with floating lace sleeves, and
her yellow hair was twisted into a bedraggled knot
atop her head.
"You advertised for a maid?" I began.
"Oh, yes; come right in," she invited mc. "Wo
will go into the dining room and talk while I finish
my lunch."
I followed Mrs. A (that for convenience; it
is not her initial) into the room.
There was neither cloth nor napkin on the ma*
hogany table.
Beside an open ginger-ale bottle stood a half
emptied glass and a plate of sandwiches; also desert
in the form of a theatrical magazine.
Mrs. A ate as she talked.
"You can cook, clean, make beds?"
"I can do general housework," I answered.
"Have you a uniform?" was her next question.
"I will expect you to wear one."
"I have some blue linen ones," I told her.
Room On Third Floor
"Well, you must look neat always, and wear a
white apron when you answer the front door. The
pay is $10, and there are only eight rooms in my;
house," Mrs. A informed me.
"I have two little children, but during summer
1 hire a girl to watch them. I must be relieved of
them mornings, as well as afternoons, when you can
look after them," she added wearily.
"I hope you won't mind my keeping one eye on
your work. 1 like to see how my maid^s caring for
my house. The girl I had before you wouldn't stay,
because I insisted on overseeing wiiat she did. And
she said she didn't have time to make butter balls
and do such little things. I like to be served well."
"I understand," said I, and went for my clothes.
When I returned to the house the next morning
I found the dishes from dinner and breakfast stack
ed high in the kitchen sink. On the table was a
chicken.
"Just as soon as you get into your apron, I wish
you'd clean that chicken and put it into the kettle
