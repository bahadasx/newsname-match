Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is coming out of the ground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
farmer's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in the reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
