A meeting of Audrain county Re
publicans was held at the Mexico
Court House Tuesday. The Central
Committee organized with the fol
lowing officers: Ralph Head of Van
dalla, chairman; H. P. Averltt of
Mexico, vice-chairman, and Harry
Householder of near Mexico, treas
urer. There was a spirited fight to In
crease the membership on the Cen
tral Committee from Vandalia and
Cuivre townshlo from two to six.
but the resolution lost. Vandalia
and Cuivre township, It is stated,
had 167 Republican votes in the late
primary while Mexico and Salt River
towiiBhip had but 29 more votes than
that, yet Mexico and Salt River have
ten members on the committee while
Vandalia and Cuivre have hut two
members. Some thought that un
fair. The full membership of the com
mittee is as follows:

ORVS STILL AHEAD.
The Recent State Primary Puts Them
Ahead In The Legislature, J loth
House and Senate.
Kansas City. Mo., Aug. 6, 1916
Although both candidates for Gov
ernor indorsed by the anti-saloon
league In the Republican and Demo
cratic primaries were defeated at
the polls Tuesday, the drys of Mis
souri will have an assured majority
in the next Legislature, no matter
which party carries the state next
November.
As a result of Tuesday's primaries,
the drys claim to have Increased
their majority In the House of Rep
resentatives. Last season they had
92 members who voted dry on every
thing. The coming season, no mat
ter which party wins, the drys figure
on at least 100 members, possibly
one or two more.
The Senate, which is the battle
ground of the wets and drys, and
has always been the brewery bulwark
against the overwhelming dry senti
ment of the House, apparnctly will be
really dry for the first time.
The claim is now made that 19 of
the 34 members of the Senate will be
dry, no matter which party carries
the state.

y L. Roy Ferris.
Old Brother Wolf was happy. He had not tasted
lamb for several days, and his sharp cars had caught the
invitation to the feast. Funny how sonic people are hap
py when they are planning something mean. It's a fine
thinir i'. ere :i "e rot lianv people hai w.iy.
As Brother Wolf pointed his nose at the man
in the moon he gave a long drawn-out "-yi." and his sharp
ears stood up straight to catch the answer, and he licked
his chops as he thought of the fine supper in store. Poor
little baby lambs, there were thousands ot them clown on
the border where Brother Wolf made his home.
Now some one else heard the call; it was Brother
Jack Rabbit. He looks almost like Brother Rabbit that
we meet in the woods only he is a great deal larger.
Brother Jack was going over to sec (Irandfather Ar
madillo. You know the old fellow looks just like a "pos
sum," only he doesn't look like a "possum." I mean he has
a sharp nose and a long tail, and small ears. But he hasn't
the fur-coat Brother Possum wears, but instead has a
hard scale like your Uncle Samuel fastens to the sides of
his battleships. Long ago Brother Wolt learned the les
son not to bite Grandfather Armadillo unless he wanted
to break one of his pearly white teeth.
Brother Jack stopped running when he came to the
home of the Owl. Rattlesnakes and Prairie Hog. Mr.
Rattler was coiled up enjoying the night breeze, for it is
hot in that country in the day time.
Dr. Owl was just finishing a fat mouse and a Prairie
Dog was sitting straight up like Fido when he performs
his tricks for company. Let's see, who was it said there
never was a house large enough for three families? But
here they are, and tbey don't wrangle and fuss, either.
"How do -ou do, friends?" exclaimed Brother Jack.
"Did you hcar'Brother Wolf's call?"
"Yes," replied Dr. Owl, as he finished picking the
bones. "It's a pity something can't be done with these
fellows."
Now that was just what Brother Jack was thinking.
But what could one poor little rabbit do with wicked fel
lows like these and besides he couldn't run very fast, for
at one time his leg had been broken, and it is hard to make
a rabbit's leg grow on straight. Although Santos the
Shepherd, at one time had put it in a splint when he
found Jack with a broken leg.
But Brother Jack had a plan of his own. Darting
forward as he best could, he avoided a bunch of cactus.
for you know tbey are like grandmother's pincushions,
"whoop-ee, how they do stick! He soon found the
flock. Every little lamb slept close to its mother, and
there were the little black-faced lambs, for you know
there are always black sheep in every llock.
But there was Santos, the shepherd, with his sling
that they all carry. The same kind that David used when
he slew the giant.
Ah, there he is asleep in the midst of his llock on a
rocky hill. Funny how sheep always like to sleep on top
of a hill in Southern Texas. But I will tell you why. In
the day time it is very hot and the sun heats the rocks,
but at night it is chilly, but the rocks remain warm, and
you will always find warm rocks on top of the hills. So in
stead of using a blanket they just lie on a warm rock.
Jack Rabbit touched his cold nose to Santo's cheek
and Santos sprang into the air, and, my what was that
noise that Brother Jack heard as he limped away? "Bang"
"Bang" for the ranch boss hat! left his ri tie with Santos
the day before for that purpose. The two thieves were
so sorry that they were so wicked, it they had time to
think it over. When Santos tells the story of how the
lame rabbit awakened him his friends smile, but Santos
has the two skins for proof and what more proof could a
fellow ask? But his friends say, "Santos, it was only a
dream."
