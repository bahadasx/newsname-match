WHO OWNS MEXICO?
Sen. La Follette Tells in Three
Articles, Writfen Straight..
From the Shoulder
Th? plain Citizen has no de
terming voice on the issue of war
or peace.
For more than 50 years money
has been powerful enough to
force war upon any country at
any time. The stude it of
worl.-f polities will find that
practically all modern wars have
been dictated by great financial
inter' 'Is.
As long as capital finds its
best field for profit in its own
country, the peace of that coun
try is reasonably secure. But
whenever flip financial interests
haw acquired such a control ol'
the ::ti• 11 a

own country and such mastery
over :iif industrial and commerc
ial affairs of th•• ii- own people,

TI N excess capital which lias

couir'rv and its people—if retain
ed at home—would reduce inter
est and farmes. merchants and
small business enterprises could
borrow upon reasonable rates.
But the masters of finance con
sider little else besides their
own profits.
The people of the United States
do not want war with Mexico.
The Mexican people do not want
war with us. And both President
Wilson and Carranza have mani
festly done everything' in their
power to avert war.
What is it. then, that menances
the peace of these neighboring
countries?
It dates far hack of the Col
umbus raid. The outrage upon
the residents of on? of our border
'towns was the logaica
1
oufcomc
of conditions for which the Mex
ican people were in no wise re
sponsible. Worse than that'
The Mexican people were really
innocent victims of traitors in
our midst. For it is charged up
on the highest authority that the
raid was inspired and arranged
for in our own country.
Do you get the full meaning
of that statem-orit? Benedict
Arnold was not more guilty of
treason.
The secret service of the gov
ernment has a 'ong arm and a
strong arm. The net may yet.
be drawn on I lie "higher-ups.'* It
is fair to assume that President
Wilson did not disclose all of the
facts in his possession when lie
declared offieally a few days af
ter the raid thai
"There were persons along the
border actively engaged in creat
ing friction between the govern
ments of lie T"fiited States and
the dp facto government of Mex
ico for the purpose of Tiringin*
abinit intervention in the infeve.^'
of certain owners of Mexican
properf ies."
There you have it! The gent
lemen who want war with Mex
ico are the gci|'em'n who haw
Mexican properties. They aiv
very powerful. They own inosl
of ill" I." if I'd States and a good
big slice of Mexico. They ill hi'
Captains of Industry: our Masters
of Finance. They own or con,

are for a strong Mexican policy, a
strong foreign policy, a hig armv
ami a big neavy.
Th'.v prate about "patriotism."
Th"y clamor for "preparedness."
They have tried to piling-' the
country into a hysteria of fear
that we are going to be thrown in
fo war with ("ierinany or England
or Japan. They have congress
"on the run."
Tli" privileged interests are
not taxing the people of the Unit
ed States for their great army
and navy scheme to fight Ger
many, England or Japan. Tlicy

They control the prices of labor
anil the products of labor. They
own the coal, the oil. the timber,
the water powers. Their pro
fits are so enormous that, they
must lower interest rates or else
invest in forign countries. The
timber, oil, coal an 1 mineral
wealth of Mexico and the Central
pnd South American countries are
most inviting in every way. The
governments are poor the labor
is cheap as slave labor.
There is .just one risk. And
that is a large risk. The govern
ments are most of them weak.
Revolutions in many of them ar«
frequent property rights are in
secure.
But a scheme has been worked
out by the masters of liiianc to
make foreign investments as
good as a gviwrninen* bond. .lust
