"One good farmer in this county
impeaches all the poor ones", Raid
President Farrell of the Oregon
Wasliington Kailroad & Navigation
Co aftr r insDeeting the wheat fields
of Morrow county. Mr. Farrell was
more than pleased with the conditions
as he found them in Morrow county,
he was jubilant. The poorest crops
this year are good, but the better ones
are the result of better farming
methods and Mr. Farrell, who is a
practical farmer was not slow in re
cognizing that fact. His visit here
took him through the principal farm
ing sections of the county, in com
pany .:th Vice-President J. P. O'
Brien, "Farmer" C. L. Smith and J.
B. Muddleston, the local agent.
Although this is the first visit of
the head officials to this Immediate
section, it must have been gratifying
to them to Hurt that the farmers here
have taken up or are following to a
large extent, the better methods
which the O. W. R. & N. Co. through
their demonstration train.s have been
advocating.
President Farrell expressed his re
gret that he did not get to meet more
of the fanners and business men at
tli is time; but this visit gives promise
of mure frequent trips into this comi
ty in the near future. lie was inter
ested in learning more particularly
of the fanner's methods here and es
pecially the conditions under which
ti e wheat is transported to the rail
road. This applies to the Eight
Mile section, where farmers are forc
ed to make a lunger haul than in any
other wheat sections of the county.
J. P. O'Brien who is a railroad man
through and through, made his first
visit to our farming section in the 23
years that he 1ms lived in Oregon. lie
liked it so well that he has decided
to come again. Mr. O'Brien compar
ed t lie wheat lipids of Morrow county
with those of the Wnlla Walla and
Palouse countries and announced that
we have better crops here this year
than the up'.p- country.

The DeMoss ftntertainers appeared
before a medium-sized audience ut
the Christian church last evening and
presented their very pleasing musical
entertainment. The first number on
the program was an orchestra selec
tion in which the two hoys, Elbert
and Homer, appeared to a good ad
vantage. Elbert plays the violin and
his execution is worthy of a much
older performer, while Homer pro
duces music of an extraordinary qual
ity on the flute. Following the or
chestra selection came a stringed in
strument number, a reading by Miss
Ponnio Olson, and a violin solo by
Master Elbert. All of these were
highly- appreciated and each one
called for an encore. The novel male
quartet, consisting of the two elder
De Moss and the two boys was excell
ent, and although the boys' voices
showed lack of development, their
singing revealed their thorough
knowledge of music. In their duet,
the two boys caused quite a bit of
amusement. This was a song repre
senting a school master and his pupil
and the pupil had much trouble in
learning his abe's.
On the whole, the entertainment
was fine and worthy of a much bet
ter house than the one which greeted
them last evening. Before the clos
ing number, Henry DeMoss gave a
short tnlk in which he recounted a
little of the history of the DeMosa
musical family. This family has been
engaged In the entertainmont busi
ness 43 years and the two boys, El
bert and Homer, are the third gener
ation to appear upon the stage. Mr.
DeMoss said the original company
gave an entertainment in Ileppner 15
years ago, and he and his brother
recognized some people in the au
dince who attended their entertain
ment at that time.
A Card of Thanks.
We desire to extend our heartfelt
thanks to all our good friends and
neighbors who so kindly assisted us
during our recent bereavement. We
also want to thank you for the beau

Crook plays have an indefinable
charm for most of us, particularly
where the detective who solves the
mystery is an amateur and is also in
love with the girl who is the victim of
the conspirators. There are various
types of crooR plays, but the one in
which a valuable gem is the motive
for the crime committed is always
sure to be replete with thrills. There

EAHH THEIR FEES
Oregon Congressman Tells How Bill
for Kelief of the Sherman Coun
ty Settlers Was Passed By
Congress.
Portland Journal.
Washington, Aug. 6. -Congressman
Sinnott, greatly pleased by tho
passage cf his bill appropriating $9 4,
000 for the relief of settlers of Sher
man county, Or., who were dispos
sessed by the Eastern Oregon Land
company, is strongly of the opinion
that attorneys claiming fees for serv
ices in securing passage of the bill are
entitled to nothing on that account.
Samuel Herrick, a Washington at
torney, has contracts with a number
of the claimants, providing that he
is to receive 20 per cent of the sum
realized for presenting their case to
congress. The bill provides that not
more than 5 per cent shall be paid on
account of such claims, and Mr. Sin
nott says Herrick is not entitled to
that.
"Herrick was of no assistance at all
in securing passage of this bill," says
tiie Oregon Congressman. "He was
rather a detriment than a help.
"When I came to Washington I
went into this matter fully to deter
mine why it was that this legislation
had not made headway. I found that
bills before congress, which Herrick
had prepared, failed to distinguish be
tween good claimants and those who
admittedly had no claim, although a
report of Special Agent T. B. Neu
liausen detailing the merits of the
different claims was available.
"Many of the items in the bills
thus presented could not be defended,
and the measure was consequently
held up.
"In conversation with Herrick I
learned that he had drafted the bill
without reference to NeuhausenVs
comment on these claims. I then in
troduced the bill which has passed,
in which I included meritorious
claims which I thought could not be
successfully attacked. This bill has
passed through my efforts and the
efforts of other members of the Ore
gon delegation. Herrick had noth
ing to do with it, and no one owes
him anything for services, so far as I
can see.
"I do not believe all the meritor
ious claims have been recognized in
the bill we have passed, and intend
to introduce another to pick up the
stragglers."
The claims of the Sherman county
settlers accrued through their enter
ing upon lands granted to The Dalles
Military Road company in 1867,
which were declared forfeited by con
gress and opened under government
authority. Subsequently the courts
vested title in the eastern Oregon
Land company, successor of the road
company, and the settlers lost their
land and improvements.
In 1904 Congress ordered the
claims investigated, to ascertain who
should be reimbursed. The senate
twice passed bills for the relief of a
much larger number of claimants
than were included in the measure
just passed, but these bills were held
up in the house because of the doubt
ful character of many of the items.
By sifting these down to such claims
as were clearly suuDorted bv evidence
at hand, Sinnott was able to obtain
passage of the bill through the house,
and the favorable vote of the senate
sends it to the president for approval.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
People of Morrow county who
want concessions at the Morrow
County Fair should make their choice
of location at once as outside con
cessionaires are asking for space
daily, and it is the desire of the
Board to give home people first choice
where possible.
