Wa Want Bible
Socialism.
We want Rible Socialism, be
cause it has co backs to scar
with slavery. Hs no hearts to
break with war. Has no child
ren to cry for. bread. For God
has said.
"Thus saith the LORD of
hosts ; There shall yet old mco
and old women men dwell in the
streets of Jerusalem, and every
man with his staff in bis band
for very age.
And the streets of the city
shall be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets thereof.
(Zech. 8-4-5 -
For He says again.
" Thus saith the Lord, of host;
Behold, I will save my people
f-om the .east country, and from
the west country;
And I will bring tbem, and
they shall dwell in the midest of
Jerusalem: and. they shall be my
people and I will be their God.
in truth and in righteousness.1'
Zech. 8-7-8)
For tbe promise-comes to us
in this manner.
"Thus saith tbe Lord of host Let
your hands be strong ye that bear
in these days these words by
tbe mouth of the prophets which
were in the day that tbe foun
dation of the house of tbe Lord
of hosts was laid that tbe temDle
might be built." (Zech. 8-9.)
x The hand of those that hear in
those days are to be strong;
for God has said, by the mouth
of the prophets, please read.
"For the seed shall be prosp
erous the vine shall give her
f ruil and the ground shall give
ber increase and tho heavens
shall give their dew and I will
cau e the remnant of this people
to possess all these things. Zee.
8-12.
Here is Bible Socialism. Yet the
word teach us that, for them to
hear in those days, they must
have a preacher And that
preacher must be sent of God
please-read.
"For whosoever shall call up
on the name of tbe Lord shall
be saved,
How then shall tfiey call on
him in whom tli'ejr have not be
lieved'and how shall tbey believe
in him of whom thev have not
heard and bow shall they bear!
without a preacher! ' " '
And how shall tbey preach
except tbey be Bent as it is
written How beautiful are the
fee!; of them that preach the gos
pel of peace and bring glad tid
ings of good things. (Rotu. 10
13 14 15.) i
And when we have a man sent
of God.' He will teach you all
things that Christ has said to
you and to bear those' things and
to heed them, brings about Bi
ble Socialism. For Christ jald,

mand'ed yoc; and lo, I am with
you at way, even unto the end of
world- Amon."' Matt. 28-20.
And Christ said the man that
was.'sent of him should do this.
Please' Vead.
"Biit.when the Comforter is
coma" whom I will send unto you
from the Father, c-en the Spirit
of Truth which proceedeth fromj
the Father ho shall testify of
me." St. John 7.5 : 20.
Therefore, Christ said,
"Hotybeitwhen he, the Spirit
of trutj), is come,-he will guide
you int;i all truth; for he shall
not speak of himself; but what
soever he shall bear that shall he
speak, and be will shew you
things to come,'
He shall glorify me, for he
shall' recieve of mine, and shall
shew it unto you
St. John '16 13 14.
For Christ says again, please
read. v
"But the Comforter, which is
tbe Holy Ghost whom the Father
will send in my name, he shall
teach you all things, and bring
all things to your remembrance
whatsoever I have said unto
you."- St. John 14 26.,
"Now this is a preacher sent of
God to thee for good. And in
order to bring about Bible Soci
alism you will have to bear bis
teachings, and obey his com
mands. In this manner you put
on tbe whole armor of God, and
when a people has once put on
the whole armor of God. then
swords will be beaten into plow
shears, and spears into prun
ning hooks, and war will not be
knpwn, and vineyards will be
planted, and the fruit of tbem
will be eateu, And every man
will sit under his own Vine and
fig tree, For the multitude of
those that believe in those days
shall be of one heart and one
soul. Please read,
"And the multitude of them
that believed were of one heart
and of one soul neither said any
of them that aught of tbe things
which he possessed was his own
but they bad all things common,
And with great power ' gave
the apostles witness of the res
urrection of the Lord Jesus and
great crace was upon the in all,
Neither wan there any among
them tnat lacked: for as many

Thursday,
Majority of Rigsdag Favors
Transfer to United States.
COPENHAGEN, 'via Londan,
Aug. 6. While the belief . still
seems to prevail that a majority
of the rigsdag approves the Sale
of the Danish West Indies to
the United States, the agitation
against thug disposing of, the
islands appears to be growing
throughout the country, influen
tial provincial papers strongly
nenouncing the proposal.
An open meeting of the rig
sdag to discuss ratification of
the transfer has been fixed for
next Thursday. The concession
bv the United States in agreeing
to recognize Denmark's supre
macy over the whole of Green
land is generally regarded as
important, and is approved.
Should the rigsdag ratify the
sale of the islands, the transfer
will be arranged speedily.

What will you
seek alter?
There Is many things that
men and women will seek after.
The first thing we shall speak
of, is money "the love of money
Is the root of all evil" This is
the first and greatest evil, From
this root comes all evils, There
is no amusements, gotten up,
in this day. or may be gotten
up, unless there is something in
connection with it to make
money, A pie supper, a testable
of any kind, the ones who get
them up, will seek every way, to
make up money tbey will work,
day and night, to accomplish
their end in making money,
they will work hard, labor both
late and early and the distance
is never to great to go, But if
the truth of the gospel, is pre
sented they are either to busy
or to tired or it is to far away,
We are giving the truth of the
Bible out every day, And every
Sabbath, But we find but few
who are interested in hearing
the truth. And for instance we
would say and announce that we
would give a lecture on the four
beasts which John saw. in heaven '
something that every one .ought
to be interested in. Again if we
would announce that we were
going to lecture on the two Wit
nesses of God spoken of in Rev.
no one hardly would be interes
ted enough to come and hear
tbe truth, But let iotno one
make the announcment that
they were going to lead all they
could down the sawdust trail
inorder to tike up collections to
get all the money they could.
Tnen.they would go by th'e 50,
and hundreds and tbe more
monkey shines tbey cut, or ball
games tbey could play tbe loud
er the people would shout, And
tbe more would hit the sawdust
.rail, And we defy the world to
show us from the word of
God a sawdust trail set. fort h
in the word".
We Lave a Highway and Way
but no sawdust trail, we have
two gosp'ols' set forth but no
sa wdust trail. God says Search
tbe scriptures for in them ye
think ye have eternal life and
tbey are they which testfy of
me. But people .to day do not
want tbe, gospel, tbey want a
sawdust trail to hij, and tbe
more money there is in , it the
better they, like it., So we beg
our readers to come and get the
word of God. seek for it with all
your heart. Seek ye tbe king
dom of God and his righteous- .
ness . and all these things shall
be added unto you. .
