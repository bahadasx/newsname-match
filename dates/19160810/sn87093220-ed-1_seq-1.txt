THIRTIETH YEAR
GEO. FISHBURNE FILES FOR
CONGRESS AS DEMOCRAT
Tacoma Attorney Throws His Hat Into the Con
gressional Ring, and Will Contest With
Johnson for Seat
WOULD SACRIFICE HIS COAT FOR WILSON
Democratic Candidate Announces Himself in
Hearty Accord With President and Majority
in Congress
TACOMA, Aug. 10.—George P. Fish
burne, assistant United States dis
trict attorney, has issued a state
ment of his candidacy for the demo
cratic nomination for Congress in
which he defends President Wilson
and criticises Charles E. Hughes. It
is as follows: •
"1 have just thrown a brand new ?75
congressional hat into the ring, and
the public may desire to know why I
am so extravagant with my clothes.
1 will do everything I can to help
elect President Wilson, and if I could
spare my coat, I would sacrifice that,
too. The only difference betwen the
Progressive and Democraitc parties is
this, that the Progressives advocated
and preached certain reforms, and the
Democrats practiced their preachments
by transforming their whole sermon
into law.
"To illustrate: Our ' Progressive
friends recognized this truth, that
when you have a high tariff wall, and
trusts and monopolies on the inside,
your wall instead of being a bulwark
of protection, becomes rather a
slaughter pen for the innocent con
sumer with no hope of help from
without. And so the Progressives and
ourselves, in 1912, advocated a tariff
reduction, and the tariff was reduced.
Now, our motives may have been the
ignoble ones, 'for revenue only' in
stead of 'for protection' but then if we
accomplished the same ' result, why
quibble? Do you think Mr. Hughes
made a larger contribution to the
cause of progress by vetoing the New
York 2-cent fare bill, and opposing
the federal income tax amendment
merely because he ascribed noble mo
tives to his actions? Deeds not talk
are what count.
" 'Wherefore by their fruits ye shall
know them.'
The Income Tax
"As a sister measure to our tariff
law, we passed an income taxe bill.
This softens the rigor of the doctrine
of taxation that unto him that hath
shall be given, and from him that hath
not shall be taken even that which
he hath, and compels him that hath
to contribute his widow's mite to the
support of the government. It ip
the first mite I have ever thought
right.
"Through Mr. Wilson, the Democrats
passed the currency bill. Now this
takes the control of the panics away
from Wall Street and J. P. Morgan
& Co., and spreading it over the coun
try, allows the government to per
form this function. Under the old Re
publican law, our currency system
could not stand the strain of the mere
domestic panic of 1907. Under the
federal reserve act, we have not only
weathered the world-wide financial
storm, but have been able to go to
the rescue of shipwrecked Europe.
"Other reform measures to the cred
it of Mr. Wilson are: The special de
partment of labor, creation of a fed
eral employment bureau, five eight
hour laws covering all the work for
the U. S., a federal trade commission,
rural credits, the tariff commission,
and a few other acts which we have
not space to mention.

SLADE TIMBER
WILL BE LOGGED
„ Receiver McPherson Contracts
"With Humptulips Logging
Company (or the Work
Geo. L. McPherson, of Portland,
who was appointed receiver for the
S. 15. Slade interests in Grays Har
bor county, has already arranged for
the logging of the Slade timber lands
in township 21, range 9, consisting of
4,800 acres, carrying about 500,000,000
feet.
He closed a contract Saturday night
with the Humptulips Logging company
which concern will log the land for
the receiver, who expects the income
from the timber to clear off the Slade
obligations and leave a comfortable
margin.

up to the camp to prepare for actual
ABERDEEN HERALD
EIGHT PAGES
"The judges of our supreme court
examine tacts a year or two old, are
bound by statutes and precedents oft
en older. Their Bible, the constitu
tion of the United States, is a very
ancient document. Their exalted po
sitions isolate* them from their fellows,
so that they necessarily become back
ward rather than forward-looking
men.
"Mr. Taft, as great a judge and
man as Judge Hughes, and one of our
greatest ex-Presidents, was not a satis
factory President. Why? Because he
suffered with 'judicial temperament,'
and it took four years of the presi
dency to cure him. Justice Hughes
has a bad attack of it. You can tell
by his speech of acceptance. I thought
when 1 got well into it, that I was
reading a supreme court decision, and
found myself turning to the back of
the paper to find the number of the
volume. In true judicial fashion, he
borrowed from the brief, the Repub
lican platform, after well diluting it.
There was no suggestion for the fu
ture, but he satisfied himself with the
i legal cure for all things, punishment
| by sentencing President Wilson to re
i tire to private life.
I "No, Judge Hughes would make a
! good umpire, but he could not be at
j the bat like President Wilson, with
j three pitchers, England. Germany and
: Mexico, all at the same time throwing
red-hot liners at him, with a grand
stand filled with many of the big
boys from his own school, like Root,
Roosevelt and Hughes, hooting and
jeering at him to try to make him
strike out, and still hit every one of
the balls and knock them over the
fence.
Peace.
"It is difficult to be neutral when
the world is at war, because each of
the warring nations says, 'If you are
not with us, you are against us.' To
actually get redress and an apology by
peaceable means from one of these un
fortunates at the time of the commis
sion of the offense, blind with the
madness of Mars, is just as sensible
as to try to accomplish the same re
sult by converting every 24 hours
1,000 living Americans into as many
bundles of bloody rags. But the Re
publicans say, 'If Mr. Roosevelt or Mr.
Hughes had been President there
would have been no Lusitania dis
aster.' Our answer is that if any other
policy had been followed than that
pursued by President Wilson, we might
now be in war. We must elect Pres
ident Wilson on account of the peace
and right that, through him, are and
have been, not defeat him because
of the 'might that might have been.'
My Au Revoir.
"I desire to say that, though born
in Virginia. I am not a hyphenated
Washingtonian. Though I learned from
the Old Dominion state-love, 1 have
been taught by Washington a broader
patriotism, a love for the United States
of America, and therefore it I should
be elected to Congress, it will be
Washington first unless her Interests
should conflict with those of the whole
country in which event I would decide
in favor of the latter."

Joe Renewitz on the elevated roadway
east of the city, who, the officer said,
was running his auto at about 50 miles

WILL OPEN UP
RICH COUNTRY
Fertile Lands of the East Ho
quiam and Grass Creek Val
ley Will Be Developed
Two districts tributary to Grays
Harbor are without means of transpor
tation, but are to be opened up by
roads this season, in each of which
there is largo acreagc of fertile farm
lands. They are the East Hoquiam
river and the Grass Creek valleys,
the former north and the other west
of this city.
The Grass Creek road will give a
route around the north shore of Grays
Harbor as far as Grass creek and
eventually, according to the commis
sioners' plans, will be extended to
a connection with the Olympic high
way northwest of Hoquiam.
The valley, in which State Fire
Warden Fred Pape, owns a large
ranch, has been settled for a num
ber of years but has had no means
of transportation except the North
ern Pacific railway. The new road,
which .will be opened as far as Grass
Creek this season, will run through
the abandoned town of Grays Harbor
City, and most of the distance will
follow the north shore line of Grays
Harbor, giving a scenic drive.
Valley to Be Benefited.
The East Hoquiam valley road will
be finished, including graveling, by
the end of this month. There is a
large settlement in the valley, be
ginning about six miles north of Ho.
quiam, but its only means of trans
portation has been the river, which
lias been partially blocked to navi
gation much of the time by logging
operations, and navigation of the up
per section is difficult under the best
of conditions, owing to the fact that
it is cmly possible at high tide. The
valley is one of the most important
tributary to Grays Harbor.

The third construction camp on the
Wishkah water project has been built

MEXICO AS ISSUE
If Hughes and Backers Choose
to Make Mexico the Issue

Wilson's Notification Speech
-Nearly Completed. Ollie
James Will Notify
WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. B.—
President Wilson will accept Mexico
as the campaign issue if Republican
Candidate Hughes and his followers
continue to indicate they desire to
fight for the presidency on this ques
tion.
This was the declaration of those
close to the president today. Pres
ident Wilson has agreed to open the
democratic campaign around Septem
ber 1, regardless of congress. Sep
tember 2 has been agreed upon as the
date for Wilson's notification, but
should it appear evident that con
gress will continue in session until
well into September, the president
may make his speech of acceptance
the last week in August.
This rallying call for the democrats
is now practically completed. The
first draft has been made. It will
contain about 4,000 words.
Senator Ollie James, who will offi
cially notify the president of his re
nomination, will emphasize the con
tention that a "united nation" stands
behind the president.
While Hughes' campaign tour may
develop necessary changes from time
to time in the president's address,
the features which will be most strong
ly put forth, according to the present
draft, include:
The policy of this country toward
Mexico and the other South Ameri
can republics.
Plans for continuing industrial pre
paredness to meet the economic sit
uation facing the country after the

ALLAN M. LOGAN
RESTS IN PEACE
Unexpected Death of Young
Lumberman Shocks Many
Friends. Died in Portland
The numerous friends of Allan M.
Logan were shocked Saturday to learn
of his death that afternoon, in a Port
land hosp'tal. where he had been taken
for special treatment and diagnosis
for a baffling ailment a few days be
fore. The Portland specialists were
unable to determine his trouble, but
his death was not expected, although
lie had been ill for several months.
On Saturday afternoon he fell into a
coma and passed the Great Divide
without regaining consciousness. An
autopsy revealed the cause of his
death to have been a tumor on the
brain.
The body arrived here Monday aft
ernoon, and was met by members of
the Elks lodge, who escorted the re
mains to the Whiteside chapel. The
funeral was held Tuesday afternoon,
services being held in the Elks lodge
room, Rev. F. F. W. Greene, rector
of St. Andrew's Episcopal church, of

known young lumbermen on Grays
Harbor, and was connected for a
number of years with the S. E. Slade
Lumber Co., and more recently with
the Carlisle Lumber company at Car
lisle. He was born at Newport, Ore
gon, about 34 years ago. and was
married 10 years ago to Miss Daisy

PERTINENT QUESTIONS
Put Up to Candidate, Charging
He Has Not Offered Single
Constructive Suggestion
NEW YORK, Aug. B.—Oil behalf of
a committee of distinguished Ameri
can writers, the executive group of
which met in New York Wednesday
at the Hotel Biltinore, George Creel
gave out the following open letter:
"To the Honorable Charles E.
Hughes:
"The professional writers who sign
this letter have small interest in par
ties, but a very deep interest in demo
cracy. It is our hope, through this
voluntary association, to assist in the
promotion of honest, educational dis
cussion in order that fundamental is
sues may not be decided in prejudice
and ignorance.
"Air. Wilson's beliefs have been ex
pressed in law and in declared poli
cies. He has made an open record
by which he may be judged. Wise
choice is not possible unless you your
self make equally specific statement
of purposes and convictions.
"Without intent to offend, we feel
justified in charging that in no single
public utterance have you filed a bona
fide bill of particulars, nor have you
offered a single constructive sugges
tion. Generalities are without value;
jlanket criticism Is worthless.
Specific Statement Asked
"What we desire to know, what it
is fair that the electorate should know,
are the exact details of your disagree
ment with President Wilson. What
has he done that you would not have
done, and what has he failed to do
that you would have done or propose
to do? Honesty and patriotism de
mand that you put yourself on record
in such manner as to permit people
to judge you as they are now able to
judge President Wilson. For ex
ample—
"1 —Would you have filed instant
protest against the invasion of Bel
gium and backed up that protest with
the United States navy?
"2 —It is arrant nonsense to talk
about action that would have prevent
ed the Lusitania tragedy. The vague
advertisement did not appear until
shortly before the hour of sailing. The
occurrence was one of those things
that civilization has made the world
regard as incredible. The only hon
est question is this: Would you have
broken relations with Germany at
once?
"3 —Would you have urged upon Con
gress an embargo upon the shipment
of munitions to the alli»s?
"4 Would you urge universal com
pulsory military service?
Questioned as to Huerta
"s—You are frank in stating that
Huerta's morals were of no concern
to America; does this mean that you
would have recognized Huerta?
"6 —As matters stand today, would
you be in favor of intervening in Mex
ico?
"7—Does your attack upon the Wil
son shipping bill mean that you are
in favor of ship subsidies?
"8 —You speak enthusiastically of
the rights of the worker. Does this
imply that you endorse the Clayton
anti-trust law and the seamen's bill?
Or will you urge their repeal?
"9—What are your specific com
plaints against the federal reserve
law?
"10 —As governor of New York, you
opposed the income tax amendment;
does this antagonism persist? Do you
or do you not believe in paying for
preparedness out of a tax on incomes,
Inheritances and munitions?
"We agree with you that it is a "crit
ical period,' by far too critical indeed
for candidates to talk in terms of
office-seeking rather than in the sim
ple, earnest language of definite
Americanism.

COUNTY FAIR
THE BEST YET
The Management Plans to
Have Fair This Year Excell
All Previous Efforts
SEVERAL NEW FEATURES
Race Track Is Widened and
Improved Until It Is One of
Best in the Northwest
That the sixth annual Grays Har
bor County fail', to be given at Klma
September 6. 7, 8, 9 ami 10, will be
the most complete exposition of its
kind in the history of the county, is
the confident prediction of Secretary
and Manager J. 11. Kirkaldie. -Many
new features have been added to
the fair this year that will make it
more educational and valuable to the
farmers of the county. New build
ings have been erected and old ones
enlarged. The racetrack has been
widened and is now a standard half
mile speed ring that is in excellent
condition. According to horsemen now
training on the fair grounds, the
track is one of the best in the North
west and this improvement will at
tract a far better class of horses to
the fair this fall, as well as make
the racing faster and more interesting
to the spectators.
In addition to the many hundreds
of premiums in the various classes
for stock, poultry, grains and grasses,
vegetables, school exhibits, etc., con
tained in the regular premium list,
special premiums have been offered
by the Aberdeen Chamber of Com
merce for community exhibits. The
cities of Hoquiam, Aberdeen, Monte
sano and Elma will not compete for
the community exhibit prizes, but out
side of these four cities each school
district will be considered a com
munity for the purpose of the con
test. At least five communities must
organize and enter the contest, and
not less than five farms shall be rep
resented in each exhibit.
Secretary Kirkaldie is responsible
for an innovation this year that will
make the fair of much practical value
to the ranchers who take an interest
in the products. This departure is
in the nature of a cost-finding re
search and is intended to bring out
the best methods of raising all kinds
of farm products, livestock, etc., and
the comparative cost of production.
Blanks will be supplied all Intending
exhibitors which they should fill out,
showing the entire cost of produc
tion —materials, labor, feed and pas
ture, quantity of feed, fertilizer, etc.
These blanks will be exhibited to
gether with short talks by the pro
ducers telling of their method of pro
duction. The interchange of ideas
and comparisons of costs should be
of much benefit to all engaged la
the same line of endeavor. '*
J. L. Stahl. horticulturist of the
Western Washington Experiment Bta
tloa >vill make a comparison of the
cost record blanks and will give a
talk explaining the means by which
the best results have been obtained
and how the farmer may take ad
vantage of the results demonstrated.
W. A. Linklater, superintendent of
the Western Washington Experiment
station, will give a lecture on the
cost results for stock.
The school exhibits this year will
be much more extensive than in any
previous year and an entire building
will be devoted to this department.
Schools in all sections of the county
will compete. In the community ex
hibits, Garrard Creek, Cedarvilie,
Summit, Satsop and the lower Satsop
have signified their intention of en
tering. Some splendid products are
raised in these localities and a great
showing should be the result.
