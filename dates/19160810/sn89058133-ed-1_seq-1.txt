CONVENTION ON SEPT. FOURTH
i
To Nominate Democratic Candidate
For Representative
District Meetings Will Be Held
Saturday, Aug. 26th
The Democratic Committee for Put
nam county met n the courthouse
last Saturday at one o'clock. Chair
man C. .H. Rickman Dresidinsr. and
Secretary J. H Cornwell at his post
of dnty, and about. 25 members pres
enL representing eight or nine dist
ricts. After some argument the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted as
the plan for nominating a candidate
for representative: -
WHEREAS, for the past several
yearB it has been the custom among
Democrats in Putnam county to nom
inate their candidate for the Legisla
ture by convention or mass meeting
of Democrats; and,
WHEREAS, the time has now
again arrived to make this selection
and the Democratic executive com
mittee has been called together to
day for the purpose of formulaling
some plan,
, BE IT THEREFORE, RESOLVED:
That a delegated convention be call
ed to meet in the courthouse in
Cookeville at 1 p. m. on the 4th day
of September, 1916, for the purpose
of nominating a candidate for the
lower house of the Legislature and
transacting such other ' business as
may regularly come before the as-
Each district in the county shall
be. represented in the convention bv
one delegate for every twenty-five
votes or fractional part thereof cast
for Wilson in the Novemiber election
of 1912 in safd district and the dele
gation in 'said convention shall be
entitled to vote their district in said
convention in proportion - thereto.
The delegates are to be well known
Democrats selected in each district
on the 26th day of August, 1916, at
1 p. m. to be called and assembled at
the usual voting place by the com
mitteemen from that district. . .. ,,
Should the Democrats in any dist
rict fail to assemble and select their
delegates . as 'Hereinbefore (provoded
then, the regularly, appointed commit
teemen from said district shall bave
the power to select delegates to rep
resent SSld district In the convention.
A list , of the delegates bo selected
from each district shall be filed with
the secretary or chairman of this
convention on ox before the first
Monday in September,1916.
In tbe event any district fails to
fceet in mass meeting as above pro
vided and select delegates and the
committeemen shall file with the
chairman and secretary of this con
vention the names of the delegates
selected,
JNO. H. ' HILL, Chairman,
JNO. VANTREASE,
D. H. MORGAN,
J. N. COX,
OSCAR WATSON.
Tnese are peculiar rules, to say
least, and we avef that not a Demo
crat in. the country knows by reading
them' exactly what they mean, and
especially the paragraph setting, the
time and place for holding district
meetings, and the Inst paragraph'.
Read them carefully and see why
you can get out of them. They are
either without sense or are cunning
ly devised for the purpose of defraud,
ing Democrats as a body from taking
any part in making the nomination
for representative. . The rules above
printed were not set up from the
original, ' but from a Copy 'furnished
us by J. N. Cox. .
The resolution as first offered get
no place or hour for the district
meetings, but was amended in tbis
respect upon motion of Worth Bry
ant. Had not this change been made
the rules would have been an out
right fraud. - ";.:-; '; V ;
Another unusual provision is that
of representation one vote for each
25 or fraction 1 thereof. This should
have been major fraction. As the
rule stands one vote may give a dis
trict one delegate., This fis an un
heard of plan. ;
The following : resolution was also
adopted: . -.-
1. We, the Democratic Executive
Committee of Putnam County,- in
regular session for the purpose of
promulgating' a ' plan to nominate a
candidate for the Legislature, and
transacting such other business as
may properly come before it, hereby
desire to endorse the candidacy of
the Honorable W. J). Scruggs for
Secretary of State and to commend
t,!- n ,vA n i
Assembly as one worthy and- well .
qualified to fill said position! We do!1
this first In recognition of our coun

who has been associated with Mr.

2. Because Mr. Scruggs as Chief
Clerk has conducted said office dur
ing the last four years on such a
high plane and is so competent to

With the opening of the T. P. I
close at hand we appeal to you to
assist us in caring for the students

that all who have rooms and can
board students notify the T P I of
the number of students they can
taxe as well as the price of board
and other details. This applies to
those desiring rooms only or board

Whenever a new student or pros

we will appreciate prompt notifica
tion so that the faculty may aid
them in getting settled promptly.
