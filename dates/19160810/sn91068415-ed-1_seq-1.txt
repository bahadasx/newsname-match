Xlie Bond Issue; Of Today
And Of A Few Days Ago
As has been stated many times
in these columns the editor of the
Review is naturally in favor of
bond issues for needed improve
ments, and twice only .before has
taken a stand against them, and
then only as to the advisability of
an issue at that time and as to the
handling of them, etc., at another
time. We have never voted against
schools and water works bonds and
certainly don't intend to ever cast a
vote against school bonds without
there is great provocation.
At the outset we were not in fav
or of the present $50,000 issue of
bonds for street improvements and
co stated in this paper apd voted
against them in the March election
ami they were defeated. And when
the same proposition came up
nisinst them f0r several reasons,
virich have been stated in these
column.2 The dissension among
the officials who were to handle the
bond money, the doubt as to the
advisability of voting such small
issues instead of making the. sum
large enough to fix all the streets,
the nrobability of
an increase in
interest on the
taxes
to meet the
bonds, the way the last election was
thrust upon us by the legislature, to
require the abutting property own
ers to pay one third each of the cost
of the streets, etc. These things
did not look good to us and we
deemed it unfair to the people and
said so The editor of. this paper
has always stood with the people
that sweat and toil for a living
when we thought the cause justified
it and shall ever fight the battles of
the working man because it is the
working man (and this takes. in all
classes that honestly toil for it liv
ing) who generally bears the burden
more or less of increased taxes. In
the past week the situation has
cleared up considerably.
1. The city officials apparently
have "gotten together" at least on
vital matters concerning the city's
interests.
2. Those who have given the
study confidently believe
iV,at the $5tj,O00 will noV 'give us
some twelve to fifteen miles of good
streets, which covers a large part
of the city.
3. The increased revenue from
taxes (10 per cent of which was
placed upon us by the Corporation
Commission) it is postively stated
will not increase the tax rate.
4- Those who were responsible
for the right of suffrage being denied
us at last election time, have been
eliminated through a later vote ' of
the people.
5. The statement of the city
council that the bond issue would
be handled under the new state law
v.hich requires the abutting proper
ty o.vners to pay only one fourth of
tae cost of the streets instead of
one-taird as originally intended.
(Of course no street or block can be
fixed without the consent of 60 per
cent of the frontage of property own
ers in b'ock or district affected.
The state law only requires a ma
jority or 51 per c-nt. So you see
there is a percepitble clearing up of
the whole matter and a reasonable
conclusion to . be drawn that the
proposed issue as now amended and
shaped up is for more inviting than
at any time previous.
MANY REGISTER FOR BOND
ELECTION
The number of people registere d
for the bond election is given at
1 079 by the registrars. It therefore
requires 540 votes to carry the elect
ion, provided all on the books are
properly x qualified, while in the
March election there were only 828
registered. This is a gain of 251
over the March registration. , In the
first ward there are 283 registered
against 148; in the third 227 against
183; in the fourth 387 against 265
in the last election. The bond pro
moters believe that the increased
registration is in their favor.
The election is to be held next
Tuesday. This week speakings are
heing held at various points in the
city, addressed by local men on
the merits of the bond issue.

To Erect Bif Movie Building
The Review learns that Messers
O. A. Kirkman, W. D. Simmons and
Geo. T. Penny will at an early date
erect a building on the corner of
South Main and East Commerce
Streets, the front of the building to
be one-story and the rear onv Com
merce street to be two stories. The
corner of the building on Mam
Street will be used for a drug store
or some other kind of a store and
adjoining this store will be a modern
moviag picture house with every
convenience and adorned with a
very handsome front. These gentle
men will erect the building and
lease the moving picture part to a
stock company for a term of years.
These improvements will add great
ly to that section of the city which
is destined at an early date to be
an important trade center, being
located so near the- post postoffice
and on the corner of Commerce
Street which is used more than any
street in the city by pedestrians as

ASPRIATIONS U? FOR A MIGHTY
FALL IN NOVEMBER
High Point, N. C.
August, 5th. 1916:
Editor of the Review;
High Point. N. C.
I read'in'your last week's issue
an editorial entitled:
"Carter Dalton has promised to
give back Ito the people in city
affairs when he take3 his seat in the
next Legislature in January, and
consequently he can most probably
get a bill through doing this early
in February, and an election can
be forthwith called and the city
government restored to the people
by March. This would give an en
tierely new set of city official? as
the majority of those now in couldn't
be elected by a vote of the people,
and the two that could probably
wiu won't accept under any circum
stances, we learn. None will hold
over as some think when Repre
sentative Dalton gets through with
the bill to restore the government
to the people, so therefore the pres
ent officials would have -to hurry
to spend all the bond money before
their successors are elected''
We have it on mighty good de-.
mocratic authority that our ReDre
sentatives for the past dozen years .
have not amounted to much, and
the people have decided to make a
change in November. Then why is
Dalton so presumptious? What
right has he got to make the fpeople
of High Point such "a promise? Why
do you "rjaffy him and get his hopes
and asphations so ;high- in August "
for sucn a mighty fall in November?
Did riot Mn Dalton know that A.
was a resident, and citizen of High
EoUitV"and candidate for- a seat
in tKeGeneral CAssemhlr of 1917?
And did he (fid not know that I was
going to be elected to that body?
Then from whence did he receive
his information that he was going to
be elected? When Jdid ne become
the political mouth-piece of the
sovereignty of Guilford County?
Is he so blinded that he cannot
read the signs of the times? Have
a few of Mr. Brockett's enemies
turned his head. Today every po
litical sign is for a sweeping Repub
lican victory in Guilford County in
November. So strong is the Re
publican hope and belief that even
the solid south will fall a victim to
the Republican avalanche of votes
in November. From every section
of the county come reports of the
rising tide a tide that over-runs to
boundaries of all Apolitical parties.
No, Mr. Dalton you should not be '
permature in what you will do
when you go to the Legislature.
You should keep in touch with the
sentiment of the people. You have
made an irreparable mistake, and
your readers know it. The voters
of Guilford County are the politi
cal jurors who are to render a ver
dict on the 7th day of November.
The people are not going to render
a verdict until they hear the facts
and evidence and when that verdict
is recorded you will find that you
are everlastingly mistaken as to
what you will do. You have lost
the trail and "barking up the wrong
tree," but I am charitable enough
with you to believe it a mistake of
the head and not the heart.
I may decide to leave the city
charter just as it is and look after
the Commissioners in May, next,
but I am not going to tell you what
I am going to do when I go to the
Legislature. But, if the - people
want the city charter changed and
other legislation done in the city of
High Point- they had better take it
up with the undersigned at once;
otherwise it might be too late.
Respectfully,
W. P. RAGAN
