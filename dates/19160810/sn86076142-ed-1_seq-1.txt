Continued Conquest of Austria With Whole Armies Surrendering

PARIS. August 10 A dispatch

bank of the Isonzo and heavy losses

(By Associated Press.)
KOMB, August 10. The Italians
have pierced the Blrong Austrian en
trenchment northeast of Monte San
Mlchele, on the Isonzo front, near
Bun Martlno. They occupied Bos
chint, capturing over 12,000 Aus
trlana. Tha fighting at the bridge across
the Uonie at Podgora leading Into
Gorizia wis one of the most ana
guinary episodes of the war. Before
the eucounted the bridge had been
named the "Death pasa."
After Italian guns obtained com
mand of Gorizia from Sabotine
heights, San . Micbele, Monte Fortln
and Basso Fortln, the Italian infantry
advanced through the bridge. After
the wildest fighting wherein hundreds
of Austriana were drowned the bridge
was taken. The entire city is com
paratively free from damage.

UOME, August 10. Notwithstand
ing deparate fighting around Gorizia,
the city was not burned by the Aus
trian nor damaged by the Italian
shell Are. None of the Inhabitants,
numbering 20,000, was injured, as
they had previously evacuated the
city. It was the desire of the Italians
to save the city from doutructlon and
the attackers employed strategy in
gaining this end. The only damage
occasioned was by the Austrlana In
attempting to destroy buldlnga con
taining military stores.
THE W WILL LEAVE SILVER
WITH FAR GREATER VALUES
In a letter to a friend in Gilpin
county, Colorado, V. 8. Senator Chas.
S. Thomas discusses the future of
sliver. He ventured the prediction,
at the lime of the breaking out of the
European war, that one of its ulti
mate and necessary result would be
Ui re establishment of silver as a
money metal upon some general and
fixed ratio with gold.
"I did this because I believed and
till believe, first, that the effect of
the war upon exchange In gold using
Mtlons would be magnified by a cor
responding but more desirable fluctu
ation between gold and silver than it
ever had. Second, because gold would
. disappear from the currt-nt of trade
In all the warring countries and silver
would very naturally fall Into the
vacuum thus created, being prefer
able to and perhaps an equally good
basla for paper currency. Third and
lastly, because the enormous cost of
the war represented by debt of strik
ing proportions would necessitate re
sort to silver as the only means of
broadening the t metallic basis for
money and credit. If I am correct In
this forecast, the Intrigues of the
money interests can only retard their
operation; the movement cannot be
avoided.
"I do not think the moneyed In
tercsu have had anything to do with
the recent rise in sliver or Its more
recent fall to. 82 Mi cents. This is

(he value of the commodity, which
are caused by sudden and temporary
demand. I think these are liable to
occur from time to time, resulting in
a permanent rise of the lew! of
market quotations. It Is too early to
predict a close of the war, and until
that arrives, little if anything will be
done for silver.
"When the war ends the total
public debt of the belligerent and
neutral European nations( who have
been obliged to lie at all times, on a
military basis at great expense), will
be far In excesB of $100,O00,0(M,0l)O
The annual Interest upon this Hum
at five per cent represents 15,000,1)00,
000, which, added to the com of
government operations, will mean an
annual tax upon their producing
masses of not less than $7,500,000,000.
This is much more than the total pro
ductive wealth of the countries con-
rned, and means repudiation, iimless
Bllver comes to the rescue of gold.
Even then, the nations will hare to
stagger along under an awful load
for many years, If they are evisr to

repudiation and payment In stiver,
the holders of these national securi
ties will prefer the latter. I there
