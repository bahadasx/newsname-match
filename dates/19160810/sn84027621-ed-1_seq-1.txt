London, Aug. 10 All Italy is cele
brating the fall of Gorizia. It is re

ITALIANS DRIVE AUSTRIANS
TOWARD TRIESTE
The Italians are driving the Aus
trians toward Trieste, twenty-two
miles away, the Italians say. This
apparently threatens the important
Austrian port on the Adriatic.
The capture of Gorizia by the Ital
ians is considered as one of the most
important gains made since the Al
lies began their offensive. Gorizia is
the door through which the Italians
hope to paS3 through in capturing
Trieste, Austria's big seaport at the
Tiead of the Adriatic sea.
A TEMPORARY CALM' :
The French report further progress

OUR STATE KEPT
ITS FRO UP
Criticism by Penrose and Other
Northern Senators of Florida
Troops was Unjust
St. Augustine, August 9, 1916.
Editor Star: There has been so
much comment in the press through
out the country, concerning the recent
mobilization of the National Guard,
that I have obtained the permission of
the governor to print and make pub
lic, a report "which was submitted on
July 25, concerning the mobilization
of the troops called for from this
state. : ''-'''
Recently in the Senate, during the
discussion of the army appropriation
bill, some of the "senators from north
ern states, and notably Senator Pen
rose from Pennsylvania, severely crit
icized the southern troops . because
they had not been moved to the bor
der. The Pennsylvania senator select
ed Florida particularly for his com
ment. It is not known, of course,
whether there has been the same dif
ficulty in the northern states in ob
taining equipment for. the troops as
there has been in the southern states,
but it is certain that no troops can
move from their camps until ordered
to do so by the commanding general
of the eastern department. The lat
ter official advised this office that
orders for the Florida troops have not
been given because the regiment Is
not fully equipped.
Obviously, this is a matter for
which no responsibility rests upon the
National Guard itself, and certainly
the remarks of the senator were un
warranted and grossly unjust, and, as
it appears from the records, the Flor
ida troops were mobilized several
days before the National Guard of
Pf nnsylvanla. The completion of the
requisite organization in this state,
and its recruitment to practically
twice its strength on the date of the
call, within three days, i3 an achieve
ment for which neither the guard nor
anyone concerned need feel ashamed.
If the method of recruiting which
was in effect at that time had not
been brought to war strength within
a very short time. ,
Yours very truly,
J. Clifford R. Foster.
