Mr. Dm-and's letter, read by the

in part:
"Inasmuch as the truth of your

resignation."
Mr. Hughes then repeated his De

Special to The WorM.
OKLAHOMA CITY. Aug. 9. Libel
suits against certain local theater
managers f,)r $25,000 damages have
been instituted by Tucker brothers,
f wners am' publishers of the Kree
Pointer, end also managers of the
Metropolitan and Dreamland theaters,
the only two signing the new wage
sale ashed by the moving picture op.
erators and stage handi. Several days
ago an article appeared in one of the
local Papers, supposedly inspired by
the theater managers' association
composed of those who have refused
to ugree to the strikers' demands. It
is alleged to have reflected upon the
business of the Tue ker brothers, and
is said by them to have contained
false statements.
This is t lie latest turn in the strike
begun hy stage hands two weeks ago.
It is reported hero today by leaders
of the "White Jtats" organization,
carrying on the strike, that other
towns will probably be Involved. A
representative of the union letnrnlng
from Tulsa this morning said that tlio
sl.igc hands in that city would also
ask for raise in wages and If not com
plied with would go out en strike at
once.
Managers here who are holding out
against the strikers sav they are not
worrying much, that they have exper
ienced very little trouble in getting
acts. This is disputed, however, by
members of the union.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 9. A plan
for adjournment of congress by Sep
tember 1 was worked out by wnale
ie-adeirs today In a series of confer
ences occupying virtually the whole
attention of senators of both parties
and transforming the opening day of
debate on the government xhip pur
chase bill which stirred up a bitter
fight when it was pressed two years
ago, into a spiritless dcM-uysiou among
the corporal guard of members who
remained in their places in the cham
ber. As a result of the day's
maneuvers the Democratic steering
committee submitted to the Republi
can leaders in writing, a proposal
that no important legislation be taken
up at this session except the shipping,
revenue', employe-is' liability and ap
propriation bills and conference re
ports with a view to adjournment b
the end o! Ihe present nionin.
Members of the Republican steer

favorably. Definite reply was deferred
