THE TOMAHAWK aims to give
every Chippewa an opportunity to
express his views through it? col
umns whether they conflict with
those of the publisher or not, and
the manager of the paper will pub
lish any article that may be sub
mitted to it provided it is not too
personal, or if the writer will sign
his own name to the article.
The Germans made several er
rors at the beginning of the war
by sinking ships that contained
women and children, but on the
whole its friendship towards the
United States can be trusted more
than that of England.
England seems to have a little
vantage now over Germany in
the war on account of the assist
ance it has, and it is beginning to
show its teeth to America. What
would England do in the event of
war between the United States and
Japan, and what would be Ger
rnany's stand
The Red Lake forestry bill has
a saving's clause in it which pro
vides^that it cannoc be put into
operation until the probable costs
have first been submitted to Con
gress for its approval, at least this
is the construction placed upon it
by some laymen. The Red L'ike
bill was the worst piece of legisla
tion ever passed against the Red
jake Chippewa interests, but Sen
ator Nelson is evidently trying to
remedy the evil he cau*ed to be
done by the latitude of his juris
dictional act on behalf of the
Chippewas.
Every member of the tribe is
looking for the big payment which
will take place here during this
year, but we predict that there
will be some disappointment
among some of those who have in
the past not convinced the govern
ment that they can use the fund*,
they receive as a gift to good ad
vantage. No doubt the officials
of the Indian office will watch
closely to learn to what use annui
tants are placing or expending the
Sfunds they will receive, so that in
the future it will be able to better
judge who are the competents and
non competents.
Justice Hughes' speech of ac
ceptance as the Republican candi
date for the presidency must be a
keen disappointment to many of
his followers, for it lacked thp
dignity which is expected of a
lan who seeks such a high office
as president. Mr, Hughes con
fined himself to attacking Presi
dent Wilson's Mexican policies al
most exclusivi ly. It is not what
Wilson ha*, done that the independ
ent voters wish to know from Mr.
Hughes, for they know this al
ready from their information
gathered from the same source as
Ale got his but what thvy wish to
know is what he will do regarding
the issues he discussed, if elected
president.

Men And Not Parlies
Should Appeal To In
dian Voters.
For several years the Chippe
wa voters have be^n voting first
fur one party and then another.
From this state their best friends
have been republicans, and the
advice of these should always be
followed, for these friends have
been tested and not found want
ing.
But we do not wish to be un
derstood as advocating the cause
of President Wilson by saying
that when an appeal was madp
direct to him, he made some im
portant changes in the service
among the Cbippewas of Minne
sota. But his good work has
been offset by the departments
under him, for it has simply been
a fight from the start of the demo
cratic administration to the pres
ent time to try and have justice
n*\ The Indian office at Wash
ington, it has stated, wished to
have justice done to the Chippe
was of Minnesota, and in this the
he-ids of the office have aoparentl.
been sincere, but department let
ters, usually prepared by subor
dinates, who cannot overcome
their prejudices in favor of red
tape, send letters here the reverse
of what is fair.
For his efforts to have justice
done to the Chippewas President
Wilson should at least have the
good wishes of the Chippewas,
but if the most insignificant clerks
in the departments and the field
service are able to set aside his
good intentions it is useless to re
ly further upon his administration
to fulfill the existing laws in favor
of Indians.
President Wilson's administra
tion has ample time to fulfill its
duties towards the Indians, but if
it fails to commence doing this
within the next three or four
months, or to fulfill the promises
made by the Democratic National
Committee four years ago to In
dim voters throughout the coun
try, it could not be relied upon
during the next four years to ful
fill these promises.
In South Dakota the Sioux have
a -sincere friend in Senator John*
son, a democrat whom they had
much to do in electing, and in
Wisconsin the Indians in that
state have a firm friend in Senator
Husting, also a democrat and who
is a mixed-blood Indian. These
two senators will no doubt have
much influence towards urging
the Indians to stand by the Wil
son candidacy.
The ludian voters of each state
therefore have varied influences
to cause them to vote either for
one party or the other. In this
state, which is so strongly repub
lican, Indian votes will probably
not cut any figure even though
ca- solidly for one party, but
they should at least express their
sentiments regarding their treat
ment frtm the federal adminis
tration by the manner in which
they shall vote.
Administrations Make No
Changes.
It cannot be denied that changes
of national administrations, since
the civil service law has been
placed as a barrier against the dis
missal of incompetent or dishonest
government employees, do not
effect subordinate positions where,
fact, changes are really more
Defective Page

necessary than in the higher posi
tions of the government service.
Federal administration cannot
change any quicker than the sub
ordinates of the departments, for
whenever a democrat becomes
president hundreds of employees
immediately spring up as loyal,
true democrats, and on account of
their experience in the manipula
tion of political spoils and their
claim to being under civil service
law, are able to secure the leading
positions in the service, and they
see to it that no other changes are
made in the service.
Once in a while those holding
high positions in the service, such
as Assistant Post Master General
Roper, under the Wilson adminis
tration, and Fiank Hitchcock, ex
assistant post master general dur
ing the Taffc administration, have
stepped beyond the bounds of
propriety in political matters.
The Minneapolis Journal of re
cent date states that Mr. Hitch
cock went as far [as to compel
President Taft to promise to put
him into his cabinet if re elected.
But the cases of Mr. Roper and
Mr. Hitchcock are exceptions in
very high positions, but there are
seldom, if ever, any exceptions in
thj more subordinate positions in
the government service, and one
thing remains unchanged, and this
is that employees continue to do
as effective political work for their
respective parties as the most act
ive politicians and they rely upon
each other in the event of changes
of administrations to prevent any
charge in their positions on ac
count of their political activities.
THE TOMAHAWK'S force has
frequently heard expressions of
sympathy among government em
ployees in favor of one party or
another, and these have been made
in such a manner as would induce
persons who are
themselves seek-
ing favors to vote as those who
are in the service have expressed
themselves.
After all the old so called "spoils
system" would be preferable to
the more dishonorable one of play
ing "good God and good devil."
Indians To Get A Large
Sum.
Washington, D. C. -In com
pliance with the provisions of the
Indian appropriation bill the In
dian bureau is preparing to dis
tribute about $1,500,000 among
the Chippewa Indians of Minneso
ta.
"The bill authorizes the secre
tary of the Interior to pay to the
Minnesota Chippewas not more
than one fourth of the amount to
their credit in the United States
treasury on appropriate basis."
said A-sistant Commissioner Mer
rit. "The money will be distrib
uted in the form of per capita
payments. Instructions have been
given to prepare the roll of all the
Indians entitled to a share of the
fund now in the treasury, and
when this roll is complete pay
ment will be made, probably in
the fall.
"The Indians who are reported
competent will receive their share
direct. These who are found to
be incompetent to manage their
financial affairs will have their
share deposited in local banks to
be disbursed by proper officials
for their benefit."
There are approximately 11,000
members of the Chippewa tribe in
Minnesota who will be entitled to
a share of the tribal fund. Mr.
Mrrritt estimated they each would
receive about $100.

THE TOMAHAWK
'Truth before Favor."
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, August
Should Examine
Books.
During the Howard administra
tion it was learned beyond the
question of a doubt in the mind of
THE TOMAHAWK that the most
overt acts of fraud were commit
ted charging to the members of
the tribe issues that had never
been made to them. Every effort
should now be made to have a full
and complete investigation made
of this.
In 1913 the late Chief Supervis
or Holcombe issued an order to
Ex Supt. Howard to furnish every
Mille Lac removal Chippewa with
a copy of the issues that were
made to him, but the superintend
ent failed to do this except in one
instance so far as could be learned,
and this was regarding the issues
that had been charged to Wah-we
yea-cumig which the latter pro
nounced to be absolutely incorrect
and fraudulent.
From his examination of the
issues, usually made, the publish
er of THE TOMAHAWK, from his
personal knowledge of thecircum
stances, stands ready to sustain
the charge of fraud which has re
peatedly been made by the paper
and others.
If the administration at Wash
ington, or Supt. Hinton himself
has the authority, a full investiga
tion of the issues should be made
now which have been charged to
Indians during the past five or six
years*'
Superintendent Hinton, for his
'i' ^^fy|W ^JPffljgJ *'wi i -ww M3HHfHA
wiwypMWw
own protection and ttie* protection
of the Indian interests, should
learn whether the frauds charged
in the issue book of this reserva
tion should be placed against Ex
Supt. Howard, or against the
present issue clerk.
There should be no lack of effort
to induce Congress to make a full
investigation of the issues and
other frauds which have been
practiced upon the reservation
people in general.
It is not surprising, in view of
the frauds that it has been charged
repeatedly were committed by
Ex Supt. Howard, that he was
able to purchase recently, as has
been stated, an expensive tract of
land and for which he paid #16,-
000, for when he was appointed as
agent here he nad been acting as
one of the State Fair grounds
guards during the fair at $3 00
per day.
The Nelson Jurisdiction-
al Bill.
It is surprising that a bill so
broad as the one recently intro
duced in Congress by Senator
Nelson, and which was recently
published in HE TOMAHAWK, was
passed without any opposition be
fore the senate Indian committee.
Senator Nelson and Congress no
doubt recognized the claims of the
Chippewas upon the United States
to be just and allowed them to go
through with very slight, if any,
amendments.
But the varied interests of the
Chippewas of Minnesota prior to
188'.), and even sirce then makes

-tto-UULjinpracticable as it is, and
when th?y fully understand it
some of the band* will object to
it, especially the Red Lake band
which stiil has separate interests
from the other Chippewas of Min
nesota.
As the bill passed by the senate
now is, the compensation for the
Red Lake forestry reservation will
be placed in the Treasury of the
United States to the credit of all
the Chippewa Indians of Minne
sota.
The Pillagers Chippewas also
have a claim for o\er one million
acres of land for which they have
retained Rogers & Wallace to
prosecute, and, according to the
bill, whatever is recovered for
them will have to be placed in the
consolidated Chippewa fund.
The Red Lake and Ptmbma
bands have other largo claims
which accrued prior to 1889 when
the consolidation of Chippewa in
terests took place, and they will
no doubt object to the present
provisions of the Nelson jurisdic
tional bill.
The Nelson jurisdiction^ bill
will no doubt be further amended
when it is passed by the house of
representatives, and steps should
be taken to correct the errors
which exist in it that would be
impracticable to the interests of
the several bands of Indians inter
ested.
One of the important points of
the bill is that the Chippewas will
have to select their attorneys after
the-bill passes anJ shall be cm
ployed under a contract to be ap
proved by the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs and the Secretary
of the Interior.
