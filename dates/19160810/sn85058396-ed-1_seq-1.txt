IRISH SITUATION
Pontiff Anxious for "Pacifica

men and Diplomats of the
Vatican Conferring.
London, Aug. 10, 11:43 a. m. The
Irish situation is being followed by
the pope with the keenest interest,
according to the Liverpool Post,
which states that the pontiff is n;ost
anxious for the "pacification of Ire
land." In an article in today's issue the
paper says:
"The pope and the statesmen of the
Vatican are most anxious for what
is described as 'the pacification of
Ireland.' This anxiety has been
made known to the Irish Catholic hi
erarchy through the most direct
sources and, of course, it has not es
caped attention. The rector of the
Irish college in Rome has been in
close association of late with the
diplomats and statesmen of the Vati

who enjoy the pope's confidence, in

TWO MEN HELD IN

Drawings and Notebook Seen
to Connect Suspects With
Black Tom Island
Disaster.
Jersey City, N. J., Aug. 10. A
drawing of what was thought at first
to be a submarine and later was ad
mitted by the designer to be a self
propelling torpedo, together with an
envelope addressed to John D. Rock
efeller tand (a note-book containing
the name and address of President
"Wilson were found today among the
effects' of Erling Iverson, who, with
Axel Larsen, was arrested yesterday
on suspicion of complicity with the
disastrous munitions explosion on
Block Tom Island two weeks ago.
Although the two men produced
persons, who declared they wore with
them in another part of the city at
the timeof the explosion, the pair
were held in 1000 bail pending inves
tigation. The drawing of the torpedo
bore the inscription "approved by
Captain J. Howard, chief of the Unit
ed States submarine department,
June 26, 1916." There was also a no
tation "to be built by Iverson & Co.,
London" and another "revolutions 150
miles an hour, or U. S."
Iverson told the authorities that he
planned and designed the torpedo and
said that "Iverson & Co." referred to
himself.
Underneath the heading "President
"WHboti" in his note-book appeared a
meaningless paragraph which Iverson
said he wrote "to amuse himself."
One letter which Iverson wrote to
his mother and did not post, told of
"the fright he got when Black Tom
blow up" and said .thoro were still
eight cars of ammunition In Black

HEAVY LOSS OF
LIFEJN FLOOD
Twenty-three Bodies Recov

REPORTS ARE MEAGER
Rescue Parties Carry Provis

All Who Need Aid.
Charleston, "W. Va., Aug. 10. Twenty-three
bodies have been recovered
from the debris carried down by the
flood which swept the Cabin Creek
valley near here yesterday. Rescue
parties have penetrated some dis
tance above Cabin Creek junction and
meager reports brought back by couri
ers and from tho railroads indicate
that the loss of life has been heavy,
although no accurate estimate can be
made. Persons driven from their
homes to the mountains are return
ing to find whole villages of mining
cabins swept away, while distress and
suffering is seen on every hand.
Two companies of the Second West
Virginia infantry left Camp Kana
wha by trolley this morning and were
taken to Cabin Creek junction with
orders to penetrate tho valley and ex
tend relief to all who needed it. They
carried provisions and tents.
Special Train Carrying Food.
A special train was being made up
here on the Chesapeake & Ohio rail
road and will go as far as the hastily
repaired tracks will permit. From
that point numbers of men, provided
with provisions, will seek out the
spots where destitution is most pro
nounced. It is expected that they
will le able to go to the entire length
of 'the valley and penetrate adjoin

morrow. Jleports reached here today from
United States Commissioner Howard
C. Smith, who led a relief party for
a number of mining companies last
night, that looting had commenced
and a number of arrests had been
made and some property had been
recovered. The commander of the
militia has been ordered to detail men
to guard property and restore order,
leaving tho greater part of the elief
work to many parties, which will be

INFANTRY ADVANCES
Battle Ebbs and Flows Three
Days Italians Make Big
Sacrifices and Austrians
Stoutly Resist.
Rome, Wednesday, Aug. 9. Via
Paris, Aug. 10, 10:10 a. m The opera
tions which led up to the capture
of Gorizla by the Italians are de
scribed in the following official nar
rative given out here tonight:
"The attack began on August 4, in
the Monfalcone Bectlon, against Hills
85 and 121 east of Rocca. We stormed
a very powerful enemy works there
taking 143 prisoners, but the adver
sary had placed In abandoned trenches
quantities of bombs which exploded,
giving off clouds of poisonous gases
just as our troops entered the cap
tured lines. Heavy masses of the
enemy then made another attacks and
our troops stupefied or asphyxiated
by the gas, were forced to fall back
to their own trenches.
Whole Front Sounded.
"On August 5 the artillery sounded
the enemy's whole front with the
object of-dlstractlng his attention and
fixing the ranges accurately. On the
morning of August 6 our batteries
opened fire simultaneously on the
rocky barrier, which, from Sabotino
to Cavarlo defends the Isatizo, and
Gorizla to the west, and agalnlt Monte
San Michele, which forms the north
ern edge of the Goribian Carso. The
artillery action of the day, long and
carefully worked out, represented a
perfect example of concentrated tire
against fortified lines.
"Thanks to our aviators and to the
observations of battery officers, the
positions of the enemy had all been
marked off clearly on target maps,
and ranges for the extension and
lengthening of fire had ben calculated
with the greatest nicety. Thus, at the
appointed time a veritable tempest of
shells fell in a wholly unexpected
manner on tho positions of the enemy,
demolishing everything systemati
cally. Infantry Columns Advance.
"Infantry columns then advanced
with customary dash, well supported
and carried tho entire formidable Sa
botino rampart, the principal fort
which forms the base of the Gorizla
bridgehead. On the heights which
cover the city to the west they
stormed the defenses of Oslavia and
of the summit of Hill 206 which com
mand Graffenburg. On the plain they
drove In a defensive lfne between the
southern border of Podgora and the
Isonzo. They also attacked on the
right bank of the river as far as
Saint Andrea. On the southern bor
der of the Caro, Italian troops cap
tured the very strong lines on the
summit of San Michele and the en
trenchments running into the San
Martino zone. Finally in. the Mon
falcone section a battalion of ber
saglieri cyclists from the third, fourth
and eleventh regiments after a desper
ate struggle, stormed all the defenses
on Hill 85 and held out there against
violent concentrated artillery fire, re
pulsing furious- counter attacks by
Austrian irifantry.
Three-Day Battle.
"Possession of the lateral pivots of
the Gorizla brldehead being assured
by the conquest of Monte Sabotino
and Monte San Michele, it remained
to take the imposing barrier formed
by the heights immediately to the
west of tho city. The battle ebbed
and flowed Incessantly for three days
Tho ground was fortified stnongly
and supported by a great number of
lines of defense thrown up by the
adversary close to Gorizia, an Impor
tant centor which rendered it easy
to offer stubborn resistance and en
abled the Austrians to make violent
counter attacks. Inch by inch, and
at the cost of generous sacrifices, our
Infantry, with the admirable co-operation
of our artillery, conquered first
tho crest and then the southeastern
slopes of tho heights and stormed in
numerable trenches, gradually driving
tho defenders before them, notwith
standing repeated counter attacks.
"As a result of all these continuous
efforts, nil the heights on the right
bank of the Isonzo, forming the
bridgehead of Gorizla and Monte San
Michele on the left bank, were cap
tured and securely held by the Ital
ians. The line of the Isonzo below
Tolmlno assured to them, their guns,
dominating Gorizla, drove out the ene
my lurking among the ruins. This
uninterrupted three-day fight cov.ers
with glory the troops of the third
army, commanded bv the Duke of
Aosta."
"Yesterday the enemy attempted to
relieve tho pressure on the lower'
Isonzo by attacks and heavy bom
bardment on various other points of
tho front," the statement said. "Other
attacks of this kind took place on tho
Tonale, In the Gludlcarie and Lagar
ina valleys on the Pasudo, on tho Val
TravJgnolo and on the Iesle. Every
where wo maintained our positions.
A squadron of eighteen Caproni
aeroplanes escorted by Nieuport ma
chines, raided tho supply stations at
Pravacina and Dorberg. More than
three tonB of high explosives were
dfropped on the railway stations and
on military depota. Good results
were observed. Notwithstanding tho
internee fire of anti-aircraft batteries
and attacks by hostile aeroplanes, one
of which was brought down, the
squadron returned safely.

Gorizla Not Burned.
Rome, Aug. 9, via Paris, Aug. 10,
D:4K n.. m. Nhtwith stun diner the des
perate fighting around Gorizia the
city itself was not burned by the
Austrians or destroyed by the Italian
artillery fire; nor were the Inhabi
tants injured. These to the number
of 20,000 having previously evacuated
the city. It was the desire of the
Italian comjnander, General Cadorna,
to save Gorizia from destruction by
the retreating Austrians, and to thaV
end he employed strategy.
After taking the mountain tops of
San Michele and Sabotino, he at
tacked Gorizla, not only from' the
front across the Isonzo, but also
from the sides and rear. When the
Duke of Aosta, commander of the
third army, who was present during
the three days of fighting, entered
the city after forcing the bridge
across the river, at the head of cav
alry and cycle corps, Gorizia was
found to be deserted, save by great
numbers of wounded and dying Aus-
was accompanied by his cousin, the
king. The only damage done by the
Austrians was that occasioned by
their attempts to destroy military
buildings filled with large quantities
of supplies.
Tho fighting at the bridge across
the Isonzo at Podgora, leading into
Gorizia, was among the most sanguin
ary episodes of the war. Before this
encounter the bridge had been named
"death cross." After the Italian guns
had obtained command of Gorizia
from the heights of San Sabotino,
San Michele, Monte Santono and
Basso Fortln, Italian infantry ad
vanced toward the bridge. After the
wildest fighting, In which 100 Aus
trians were drowned, tho bridge was
taken. Entrance to the city then was
comparatively easy.
Italians Continue Pursuit.
Paris, Aug. 10, 9:20 a. m. A Havas
dispatch from Rome says that the
Duke of Oosta's army, having passed
the left bank of tho Isonzo, continues
the pursuit of the Austrians, and word
came that heavy losses, particularly
In respect to prisoners, are being In

New York, Aug. 10. The Unltedl

through mediation' a country-wldo jj
strike to enforce the employes' de
mands for an eight-hour basic pay
and time and a half for overtime.
Nothing was officially disclosed as. 1
to the success tho mediators met, but j
it was learned on good authority that
the brotherhoods had shown no diB' j
position to modify their demands.
Status Is Unchanged. j
"The status is unchanged" w.as they i
only comment which A. B. Garretson !
head of the conductors' brotherhood,'
was willing to make after the con
ference adjourned.
"We have only scratched the sur-
face," said G. W. W. Hanger, one off
the three members of the mediation
beard, "the situation may be cleared
un within twenty-four hnnrn nnd thpn
'negotiations may continue for a j$j

It was assumed that the mediators,' !
as was the case at the first meet-w il

how far they were willing to go ity If
making concessions which wouldj j
bring both Bides to common ground1! !j

however, it was learned that they: J
were still firm for their demandB as1 (l
originally presented to the railroads.) j

of the efforts of the mediators, it m
was said that they informed them jjj
that they saw little chance of reach-l m

, The mediators, however, it waaj
i -men would offer concessions at tc- t J

it clear it was understood that they 1 j

cret. Mr. Chambers said tho media- 1
tors would have a much better Idea J
of the situation after talking with tho , 1
employes' committee today. . , ij
There are three possible results (j. IB
tho mediation. One is that the fed-! ,1
eral board will be able to get .th&l ;I
managers and workers to sign -anj
agreement. Another is that the medl-i ji
ators will he able to Induce both par-l In
ties to consent to arbitration, if medl-' ; j
atlon fails. Tho third possibility is; M
that the federal board will fall In' ;
both these endeavors. !(j
It was predicted today that if the ;
board should be unable to compose if
the differences, President Wilson. M
would ask representatives of the con-
tending factions to meet him in Wash-
ington and that ho would asK inemj .
to arbitrate their differences. The. tt
mediators announced that no state- 1
ment would be forthcoming lrom ,
them until they either ruve succeed- II
cd or failed. It is understood thati W
the labor leaders pin their hopes of ffl
settling the dispute upon mediation m
rather than arbitration, now that tho jl
managers have failed to agree with
them. They are opposed to arbitra- 1
