lesson to the many farmers who
bit at this easy looking game
Of course, the ones that got the
lone time loaus are not hit so
hard, as those loans at but 5.
But it was only intended to let

school house Friday night. Tho
bills for overhauling and improv
ing the school property were al
lowed, amounting to $175. A
concrete walk was ordered con
structed, running from the build
ing to the street. The collection
of all taxes due the city was dis
cussed, and a committee of t v
was appointed by the Chairman
to confer with the Marshal and
look after this business. It is the
intention of the Board of Trus
tees to use all moneys to the best
advantage, and it is hoped that
all owing taxes will pay up at
once and avoid trouble.
how to make our soil more pro
ductivo through right treatment
and cultivation. They will pro
vide Powell county with a farm
demonstrator if the county will
make provisions for part sain ry
and we trust that she will. It
will menu a tremendous forward
step for the county to have a man
who will go over the farms of tho
county and show the farmers how
to grow more aud better crops.
Prof. Mutchler told ot how one
old farmer said no one could learn
him auything about farming. He
kuew all there was to be known.
But his boy put in an acre of corn
alongside of his father's corn anil
tedded it under tho supervision
of the farm demonstrator. The
father raised 25 bushels to an a

The champion boy corn raiser

President Henry Barker, of Un
iversity of Kentucky, gave what
was said by many to be the great
est address ever given iu Stanton,
Tuesday morning at the Chautau
qua. Ihe writer has heard many
line orators and speakers in dif
ferent states, but he never heard
a greater address and a more
timely one. The pity is that ev
ery man, woman and child in
Powell county could not have
heard it. It was a marvelous and
masterful address aud held the
audience spell bound for two
hours and they clamored for
more. Every teacher in the
county was expected to be at
that meeting, but only a few
were there. Scores of people
said it was worth the price of the
whole Chautauqua and it was.
The writer wishes to give out the
cream ot his address though lie
can not do it justice iu his own
anguago. Ids aculress was on
Education. He told Kentucky's
coining into the Union and of tho
splendid Anglo-Saxon blood ot
her people, of the great men aud
women she had produced, of the
great Kentuckians she had given
to otiier 6tates aud to tho world,
as Lincoln, Champ Clark, Under
wood, and ecores of others. To
day Kentucky is not producing
on our own soil the intellectual
giants that we once did, but we
aro producing tho fiuest whukey
the world over saw. This fine
Kentucky whiskey makes the fin

tho rnggedest children, tho heart
