Minuet, Amvrills, Ghys....................
Misses Howard and Mrs. Brokaw
Melodv in F, Hubenstein ....................
....................................Miss Millick
About thirty young ladies gave their
undivided attention to the program.
The Club had as honored guests, the
M issus Howardof, Salt Lake City, who
remlered "Ma jit* Flute" on cello and ,
violin with Mrs.Brokaw in the most
creditable manner. As there were sev
oral guests at the club who had heard
the "Mnjic Flute" overture given by
the Metropolitan Opera Company, of
New Vork, it awakened many mem
orios. The young artists played with
such feeling and appreciation and dem
uistrated unusual talent. The Club re
grets that they eannol have these young
belies with them at all their meetings.
The Moonlight Sonata, as rendered
by Miss Millick, was most pleasing.
Her delicate touch and thorough know
ledge of the thought that Beethov
was trying to convey to the blind girl
for whom he was improvising, she
made evident to her listeners. Miss
Millick through her hard work and ser- j
ions application, is developing unusual j
talent. She gave as an encore Ruben
stien 's Melody in F. The club at its
business meeting elected Mrs. John G. j
Brown and Mrs. Blanche Kldredgc as j
patronesses. N'-^he meeting this week!
will be at the home of Mrs. F. W. Wil- |
son when tlie subject of Harmony will
be discussed and the life of Mozart Will f
be given by Mrs. Fred T. Dubois, along,
with musical selections from Mozart by
Miss Millick ami Mr. Robbins.
