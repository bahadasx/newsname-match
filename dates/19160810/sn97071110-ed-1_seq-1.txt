Merchants and newspapers say a great
deal about patronizing home industries, but
when it comes to the real test one merchant
seems to vie with his competitor to sell his
customer something that the other fellow
does not have. This is especially true in the
vegetable and produce line, very much to
the detriment of the resident truck fanner,
and very costly and extravagant to custo
mer. The overhead expense on some pro
ducts are almost unbelieveable,; as for in
stance, on California lettuce that sells for
. 5c per head, the grower gets 9c per dozen.
The above practice has forced us mtojaban
doning many vegetables that we formerly
grow as there is absolutely no profit left,
but what we grow and market'now is

This store never wab
bles on the question of greater-value-giving. Our
merchandise is purchased on a quality basis from
such quality clothes makers as
THE HOUSE OF
KUPPENHEIMER
We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
value.

Great Amount of Product Growl on
Undeveloped Blocks Neat Plots
Add to Gtj's Beauty
Booit your town, get out with your
icy the and cut the weeds and grata
from parkingi, cleanup those vacant
lots," was one of the messages brought
to town bv Lecturer Sias. who was one
of the speakers at the recent Chautau
qua. Mr. Sias message was not
needed by a large number of Hood
River men; for before hia name bad
ever been beard of, they were putting
to practce hia preaching, and weeds
and debris were being cleared from
vacant lots. Even while Mr. Sias was
speaking, luxuriant cropa of vegetables
were growing luxuriantly on undevel
oped blocks.
But the words of the visiting Chau
tauqua speaker should have been heard
and heeded by a large percentage of
the residents of town, who have appar
ently done nothing toward improving
the looks of the residence streets.
Weeds are grown as rankly on some of
Hood Kiver s streets, the most fre
quently used residence streets, mind
you, where all visitors may see tnera
and make whatever comment they see
fit, as in a tropical wilderness. It is
probable that local men would notice
weeds, if they were to visit another
municipality. They have passed and
repassed the weeds of the borne town
so often that they have forgotten
them. They have grown calloused to
the weeds just as to the beauty of the
surrounding scenery that is seen every
dy-
One city garden that is often
seen oy visitors as wen as me nome
residents is on Oak street, just east of
the Cottage hospital. Here in a por
tion of a block preacher and banker
are growing enough vegetaoiea lor
their home consumption. The men are
participating almost daily in healthful
exercise in the care of the plots. Their
grocery bills are reduced to an appre
ciable degree. The town of Hood River
is benefitting from the enterprise of
the men, because the vacant lots,
planted to the orderly rows of vege
tables, are much more appealing than
they were covered with an array of
unkempt weeds.
Just take this lot ana compare it
with others, not cultivated, in any
other part of the city. Then draw
your conclusions.
On cascade avenue a number or res
idents are exponents of vacant lot gar
dening. One of the finest gardens in
town is between Fourth ana rutn
streets on Cascade avenue. Here
Charles Richards, despite the fact that
he has been ao unfortunate aa to lose
one arm, is growing an abundance of
beans, potatoes and sweet corn. He
supplies bis own. table and makea a
neat aum from aaies to local grocers.
Mr. Richards last year sold, the first
loeal sweet 'corn that appeared on the
market here.
City Recorder H. L. Howe is a home
gardener, and a visit to his place on
the Heights is worth wnue.
But one of the best examples of a
backyard that can be found in town is
in the rear of the city hall. Here City
Water Superintendent Price gathered
ud the boxes, cans and refuse of years,
spaded up the soil and planted it to
vegetables ana nowers. ine pi see was
once the haunt of stray cats. It would
now make an appealing nook for
lovers.

REPARATIONS FOR
MOTH IS URGED
The impression in some of the sec
tions east of the Cascades that Hood
River people are apathetic over pro-
nosed 'improvement of the east exten
sion of tbe Columbia River highway is
refuted by tbe very action of local mo
torists, numbers of whom weekly are
taking motor trips through eastern
parts of the state, wnue it is no more
than natural that Hood River citisens,
because of their geographic location,
be interested more keenly in the com-
nletion of tbe scenic river route be

Mrs. Blanchar. Mr. and Mrs. A. D.

benefits which will accrue to the road

RANGERS JOURNEY TO PARKDALE
Most of 350 Members of Rural Organiza
tion, and City Guests, Will Attend
the Encampment
By Leroy Childs. ,
During the past week first genera
tion worms have been leaving the ap
ples in large numbers; some of these
have passed Into the pupal stage and
ill Issue as moths in a few days,
following which eggs will soon be de
posited. In order that the poison
may be on tbe fruit before any ot
these hatch, growers should plan to
begin their sprayings next week (Au
gust 14-20). There will undoubtedly
be some eggs of the second genera
tion batching by tbe 20th of the
month and for this reason it will be
well to have the spray on by then,
The behavior of the codling moth
this past summer has been far from
normal; the appearance ot the second
generation is practically li day lat
er than last year and nearly a month
later than occurred in 1914. This
condition is not confined to Hood Riv
er alone as indicated from correspon
dence received from several eastern
entomologists, who report a similar
condition existing.
Many growers applied arsenate of
lead during the last few days of July
and early in August; the date of this
application would have been 'just
right in 1914, but this year the mater
ial was practically wasted, the only
benefit derived being that it caught
few stragglers of the first genera
tion. The date of the application of
codling moth sprays depends upon
the development of the insects and is
not governed by dates used in pre
vious seasons of successful codling
moth control. Seasonal variations
are such that the f Ho wine of such
procedure as the last mentioned are
very unsatisfactory and would prove
disastrous in a season of prevalent
codling moth activities.
The codling moth will do a great
deal of injury at a late date this sea
son unless the growers of the North
west are not watchful. Many worms
will be entering tbe apples after the
15th of September; for this reason
orchardists who have had trouble
with the pest iq the past should not
only put on the August spray but
should follow this up between the
10th and 15th of September In order
to avoid the losses that will occur.
With the arsenate of lead it would
be very advisable to apply Bordeaux
This would prove not only advantage
eous In preventing a late Infection of
scab, should the weather conditions
favdr such development, but in con
trolling apple tree anthracnose. This
disease is becoming a serious factor
in many localities and as Infection
occurs with the first Fall rains, Bor
deaux applied after the fruit Is bar
vested does not prevent the early in
fection.
The following formulas are there
for suggested for the next spray:
For codling moth and anthracnose:
Bluestone S lbs.
Stone lime 4 lbs.
Arsenate of lead (paste) 2 " '
Water 60 gaL
For codling moth only:
Arsenate of lead (paste) 6 lbs.
Water 100 gals.
Tbe rains of Monday night and Tues
day morning while they threw a great
fright into tbe minds of Hood Kiver
county residents, anticipating the
pleasures of the Pomona grange en
campment at Parkdale, were really a
blessing. Tbe sun clesred at noon and
by the middle of the afternoon a stream
f automobiles and vehicles was filing
into the big grove near Mclsaac's
store. The precipitation laid the dust
of highways and traveling was made
more comfortable. The humidity of
the comfortably cool atmosphere
brought out the resinous aroma of the
forests, and it was a happy faced
throng that participated in the big
opening bonfire held Tuesday night.
Practically all grangers of Hood
River county have signed up for the
week's encampment, and perhaps be
tween 500 and 1000 people will partici
pate in the event.
the programs began yesterday after
noon, according to schedule One of
the big events of today will be tbe lec
ture by W. L. Finley, state biologist,
who will tell of wild birds and their
habits.
Billy Sundsy. a granger at heart and
who expresses a growing enthusiasm
each year after a visit to his Odell
home, will deliver his famous sermon
against booze Sunday afternoon. The
address will be the first and only one
delivered this yesr by Mr. Sunday in
the open air. "At first Mr. Sunday
declined our invitation to be with us,"
ssys Mrs. E. W. Dunbar. "He only
decided to come to Parkdale in order
that he might plea with the people of
Hood River county to oppose the pro
posed brewery bill to be voted on in
November."
Special rates for the encampment
have been made by the Mount Hood
Railroad Co. The Fashion Stables have
announced that they will operate spe
cial cars at any time as many as eight
more passengers form a party for
the Upper Valley trip.

RUNK ROAD IS DIS-.
CUSSED AT MEETING
At a meeting here last Thursday
night of goed roads enthusiasts with a
party of Portland men and Mate High
way Engineer Lewis, tbe stimulating
effect of tbe recent application of the
State Highway Commission for federal
funds for construction on tbe Columbia
River highway in tbe county and the
proposed opening by the United States
forestry service of the link ''Cast of
Mount Hood of tbe Loop highway was
evidenced by enthusiastic expressions
of local citisens, who declare that Hood
Kiver county should vote a bond issue
for the purpose of constructing a trunk
road through the Hood River Valley to
connect with the proposed Loop high
way at Mount Hood lodge.
Tbe Portland men here for the meet
ing were: T. H. Sherrard, state for
est supervisor, B. J. Finch, senior road
engineer of the United States Forestry
Department: Jacob Kanzier, chairman
of tbe Civic committee of the Portland
Chamber of Commerce, and Amos S.
Benson. With the exception of Mr.
Benson, all visitors spent Thursday on
a tour over the proposed Loop highway.
They left Portland Thursday morning,
coming by way of automobile to Gov
ernment Camp. From the intersection
of the proposed Loop route with the
Barlow road to Mount Hood Lodge, the
men rode norseoack, reacning ine
Lodge at 7 o clock. They arrived in
Hood River at 9 o'clock, having trav
eled a total distance of 99 miles. The
men declared the meadows, forest rand
and tracts of blossoming Mount Hood
lilies east of Mount Hood a veritable
paradise at tbe present time.
Tbe proposed trunk line in Hood Kiv
er county, a part of tbe Loop highway
project, will probably pass up tbe Hood
river gorge on a water grade. It will
be utilitarian in that it will furnish
ranchers of the valley with the beBt
route of transporting their crops to
market. While here Mr. Benson, ac
companied by C. A. Bell, hiked up the
gorge over a portion oi tbe proposed
route.
COOPER'S SPUR
ROAD WORK IS ON
Work has been started on the high
way penetrating the cascade na
tional forest as far as the foot of
Cooper's Spur on the northeast base of
Mount Hood, and before snow nies in
late autumn it is expected, according
to County Commissioner Hannum, that
the way will be completed.
Tbe new road, which is being built
with funds raised by private subscrip
tion, will connect with Upper Valley
roads and with a maximum grade of
seven per cent will make the snow fields
of Hood accessible to the motorists.
The new highwsy will in a great de
gree eliminate tbe old steep toll rosd,
the terminus of which is at Cloud Cap
Inn.
Upper Valley ranchers are donating
their services and wagons and teams
to the enterprise.
