Berlin, July 30.-Reports of a great
conflagration at Petrograd, in which
a bridge across the river Neva, 12
large steamers, including several
trans-Atlantic liners, and the Putiloff
gun works and other establishments
were destroyed, are printed in the
Lokal Anzeiger. In its account of
the fire the newspaper says:
“()n Tuesday the wooden palace
bridge across the Neva took fire at
several places. Flaming pontoons
drifted to Vassili Ostmv (Basil Island)
where the huge fire broke out, and
also to the port, where 12 large
stunners, including several trans-
Atlantic liners, a floating dock, the
Putiloff works and other estahlish

Wilson For Prosperity.
Bank Deposits, Railroad Earn
ings and other standards show
enormous gains.
New York, Aug. (.■ —The Demo
cratic Textbook in fast nearing com
pletion, announcment being made to
day at Democratic National Head
quarters that the first edition would
he issued between August 15 and 20.
The hook will contain about 400 pages
setting forth the achievements of the
Wilson administration, sections of it
being released from time to time for
use of the newspapers.
The first chapter deals with a ques
tion that touches every American
heart to the quiek and is the marvel
ous story of business prosperity. This
chapter lias been written by an ex
pert who has told the story simply,
effectively and logically, and he sets
forth for the busy business man the
real meaningof “The New Freedom,”
afretdoniuf industry and finance,
undampered of the old conditions.
The chapter proves from official fig
ures that the gain of the States in
hank deposits over 11)12 as a whole
was 83,1 1'd,811,000. Of this in
crease the Southern States show an
increase uf §2IS,SSI,(HID, an increase
of 2(1 7-10 per cent., and the Middle
States one of $658, 103,(MM, or 2113-10
per cent.
The real potent factor "of this pros
perity, it is pointed out, is that it is
not due to the “munitions business,”
hut that with these profits eliminated
the record surpasses all those of for
mer years in the history of the na
tion.
As an index of the vastly increased
volume of the country’s business dur
ing the last four years, it is stated
that the hank clearings of the United
States during the first six months of
101(1 under Wilson were approximate
ly were 10 per cent, larger than in
the first half of HH2 under Taft, and
constituted 70 p"r cent of the full 12
months’ transaction of the record
Republican year.
'l'he six months’ total of 101(1 is
§118,SOO,O(M) t (M)0 (Rradstrect’s) a
gainst 885,100,000,(MX) fur the first
half of 11) 12, a difference of over
85,5(M),000 (MM) monthly.
Another standard measure of the
country’s business activity is the pos
tal receipts. Receipts of the postal
service for the Wilson administration
exceed those of the preceding Repub
lican administration by approximate
ly 6235,000,000, or 25 per cent., not
withstanding the heavy falling off of
these receipts from August 11)1-1, to
June 15)15, owing to the European
war.
The individual income tax produe
during the y.-ar ending June 30, 110(1
$67,1)27,488 of revenue, an increase
of 65 pr cent. The corporation in
come tax in 11)16 produced $56,909,-
I) ,as compared with $31), 155,000
iu 11)15 and $28,583,(400 in 11) 12, an
increase of 45 per cent over 1015, and
of approximately 100 per cent over
the Republican administration 11)12.
The gold stock of the United States
today is double that of France, and
$500,(XM),000 greater than that of
Germany and the United Kingdom
combined. No country ever had the
solid gold foundation for its business
that the United States has today.
The wealth of the United States for
II) is estimated by the United State
Department of Commerce at $228,-
000,000,(MX) in 11)12, a four-year gain
of 21 8-10 per cent.
American commerce outranks lead
ing foreign countries by $1,000,000,-
000, and it passes the Republican
record by over $2,600,000,000 or 08.5
per cent.
American exports in the fiscal year
of 1916 exceed $1,300,000,000. The
Republican record in 1912 was $2,-
200.000, (MM). Four years of Repub
lican trade balances —1901), 1910,
1911 and 1912 —together make sl,-
612.000. or about $5(M),000,000
less than the Democratic balance of
1916.
The total industrial production of
the United States in 1916 —including
products of agriculture, manufac
tures, mines, quarries, oil wells, for
ests, fisheries and new buildings—
approximates a value of $15,000,-
000,000. The war munitions exports
are $480,000,000 for the fiscal year,
or only 1 per cent of the country’s
industrial product.
A Family Newspaper—lndependent in Politics—Devoted to Literature, Local and General News.
The 81,350,000,000 l>y which ex
ports of the recent fiscal year to Eu
ropean warring nations exceed our
normal exports to those countries
represents only 3 per cent of our total I
industrial production.
The entire 81,300,000,000 of our
1916 exports - to all countries are less
than 10 per cent of our aggregate
volume of production.
Railroad earnings in 1916 are the
heaviest known and run about 850,-
000,000 to 850,000,000 per month
larger, or 25 to 30 per cent compared
with 1912. For the fiscal year ended
June 30 last (Interstate Commerce
Commission) railway earnings were
83,400,CM>0,000, against 82,710,000,-

SEAL WAS HIS SIGNATURE
Babylonian Stamped Documents and
Letters Instead of Going Through |
the Formality of Signing Them.
Practically every man of any stand
ing in ancient Babylonia had a seal ,
cylinder or seal, the Impression of
which upon the document or letter
served the purpose of his signature.
Thousands of these have been found,
out out of all kinds of hard stone,
which bad been Imported from distant
lands, for Babylonia is an alluvial {
plain.
As a substitute for a seal the Indi
vidual would make his thumb-nail
mark upon the soft clay or Impress |
upon It a portion of his zlziktu, which
was a cord attached to an undergar
ment. This In all probability Is to
be identified with the zlzlth mentioned
In the Old Testament (Num. 16:38-
39), and even at the present time
worn by orthodox Hebrews.
In all periods scribes are very nu
merous. This is Inferred from the
fact that In some periods almost every
document Is found to hare been writ
ten by a different scribe. In the As
syrian period women are known to
have belonged to this profession. The
scribes wrote the legal documents, as
well as the private letters of Individ
uals. They even placed the seal Im
pression upon the legal documents, In
proximity to which they wrote the
name of the person to whom It be
longed, usually the obligor or the wit
ness.
In the time of Hammarabl (about
2000 B. C.) there was at hand an offi
cer called the burgul, who was pre
pared to cut temporary seals upon a
soft material for those who did not
possess them. This is the custom In
oriental lands in the present day.
In Constantinople, for Instance, the
curbs of certain streets are lined with
scribes prepared to write for the Il
literate. An occasional man among
them Is provided with little blank I
stamps In soft brass, and with an en- i
graving tool Is prepared to cut the slg- ,
nature or Initials of the man upon one
of them while he waits. The Impres
sion of the stamp is affixed to his let
ter In place of his signature.—Prof. A.
T. Cleg, In Natlo r *1 Geographic Maga
zine.
Summer's Sure Sign.
“There ure various ways by which
we cun tell with more or less certain- I
ty when summer has come," said
Mr, MacFllckerton. "You can tell
In some degree by the weather and
the temperature. You can tell In
some measure by the clothes you see
people wearing and by the advertise
ments of summer resorts In the news
papers. in seasons such ns the pres
ent you can even tell something about
when It ought to be here by consult
ing the almanac. But, after all, in any ;
season, the one sure sign that summer
has actually come Is found In that one, j
single, solitary fly that comes In to
wake you up ahead of time In the I
morning.” _ _
Hughes Points the Way
| The speech of the Republican can
didate for President was a keynote
speech, indeed. Not one person In
the great audience at the Carnegie
Hall meeting was in doubt for one
moment as to just what he meant by
everything he said.
| HU address was comprehensive, log
ical, clear and all sufficient for the
occasion. There can be no dispute
as to this. Plainly Mr. Hughes is a
man who "knows what he wants when
he wants It," and It is the opinion
ef political authorities who heard him
and who have since read hls remarks
that be knows, also, how to get It.
It was incumbent upon the Repub
lican candidate to confine the scope
ef his remarks to the limitations of
the occasion, but his crushing analy
sis of the shortcomings of the pres
ent administration of the government
Is merely an earnest of what the tone
and the contents of his speeches will
be when he gets on the slump.
At Carnegie Hall Mr. Hughes ad
verted to every general question that
la apt to be a serious Issue In the
campaign aud In language that will
be absolutely clear to every man or
woman able to read he stated his
opinions, hla convictions and hls pur
poses. On the stump he will argue
those points In detail. As an orator
be Is eloquent, his personality attrac
tive and his marshalling of facts so
cohesive that he bolds his audience
to the end. He makes it easy (or
them to follow him and hls points
ere not lost,
i There was nothing equivocal, noth
ing apologetic In the Republican can
didate’s speech of acceptance. He
called a spade a spade, and the unani
mous opinion of those who heard him
was that he shot to the center aud
rang the bell. The Rep ibllcan cam
paign Is now open, and those who
will speak and write and work for
the success of the Republican ticket
can wish fur no mure adequate cam
i palgn document, no more satisfactory
•tatement of issues than are found In
the candidate’s salutatory.
Brief Sentences Featuring the
Speech of Acceptance
of Charles £. Hughes.
America First and America Efficient.
I We are too great a country to re
quire of our citizens who are engaged
In peaceful vocations the sort of
military service to which they are
now called.
We cherish no illusions. We know
that the recurrence of war is not
to be prevented by pious wishes.
We denounce all plots and con
spiracies in the Interest of any for
eign nation.
Adequate preparedness Is not mili
tarism.
Dur .ig this critical period, the only
danger of war has lain In the weak
court* of the Administration.
The Nation has no policy of ag
gression toward Mexico. We have
no desire for any part of her terri
tory.
We propose that in the competitive
Struggle that le about to come the
American workingman shall not suf
fer.
This representative gathering Is a
happy augury. It means the strength
of reunion. It means th->t the party
f Lincoln is restored, alert, effective.
The dealings of the Administration
with Mexico constitute a confused
chapter of blunders. It Is a record
which cannot be examined without a
profound sense of humiliation.
We must take Vera Cruz to get
Huerta out of office and trust to other
nations to get our own citizrns out
of peril. What a travesty of Interna
tional policy!
Destroying the government of
Huerta, we left Mexico to the ravages
of revolution.
I stand for adequate Federal Work
men’s compensation laws.
The Administration was to seize and
punish Villa for his outrage on our
aoll. It has not punished any one;
we went In only to retire.
I favor the vote for women.
THE COMPELLING PERORA
TION TO MR. HUGHES’
ACCEPTANCE SPEECH.
We live In a fateful hour. In
a true sense, the contest for the
preservation of the Nation is
never ended. We must still be
Imbued with the spirit of heroic
sacrifice which gave us our
country and brought ua aafely
through the days of civil war.
We renew our pledge to the an
cient ideals of individual liberty,
of opportunity denied to none
because of race or creed, of un
swerving loyalty. We have a
vision of America prepared and
secure; strong and Just; equal
to her tasks; an exemplar of
the capacity and efficiency of a
free people. I endorse the plat
form adopted by the Convention
and accept ita nomination.
IN PREPAREDNESS THE AD
MINISTRATION HAS FOL
LOWED, NOT LED.
In the demand for reasonable
preparedness the Administra
tion has followed, not led. Those
who demanded more adequate
forces were first described as
“nervous and excited.” Only
about a year and a half ago we
were told that the question of
preparedne s was not a press
ing one; that the country had
been ml informed. Later, under
the pressure of other leader
ship, this attitude was changed.
The Administration, it was
said, had "learned something,"
and it made a belated demand
for an increased array. Even
then, the demand was not prose
cuted consistently and the pres
sure exerted on Congress with
respect to other Administrative
measures w r as notably absent.
We a r e told that the defects
revealed by the present mobili
zation are due to the “system.”
But it was precisely such plain
defects that under the constant
warnings of recent years, with
the whole world intent on mili
tary concerns, should have been
studied and rectified. The Ad
ministration has failed to dis
charge its responsibilities. Ap
parently, It is now seeking to
meet political ex'gencias by Its
naval program. But It has im
posed upon the country an in
competent naval administration.
—‘From Mr. Hughes’ speech of
acceptance.
TRUE INWARDNESS OF THE
VERA CRUZ INCIDENT.
In tho Spring of 1914, occur
red the capture of Vera Cruz.
Men from one of our ships had
been arrested at Tampico and
had been discharged with an
apology. But our Admiral de
manded a salute, which was re
fused. Thereupon the President
went to Congress, asking au
thority to use the armed forces
of the United States, Without
waiting for the passage of the
resolution. Vera Cruz was seiz
ed. it appeared that a shipload
of ammunition for Huerta was
about to enter that port. There
was a natural opposition to this
Invasion and a battle occurred
in which nineteen Americans
I and over a hundred Mexicans
were killed. Tills, of course,
was war. Our dead soldiers
were praised for dying like
heroes in a war of service.
Later, we retired from Vera
Cruz, giving up this noble war
fare. We had not obtained the
salute which was demanded.
We had not obtained repara
tion for affronts The ship with
ammunition which could not
land at Vera Cruz had soon
landed at another port, and its
cargo was delivered to Huerta
without Interference. Recently
the naked truth was admitted
by a Cabinet officer. We are
now informed that "we did not
go to Vera Cruz to force Huerta
to salute the flag.” We are
told that we went there "to
show Mexico that we were In
earnest in our demand that
Huerta must go.” That Is, we
seized Vera Cruz to depose
Huerta. The question of the
salute was a mere pretext.—
From Mr. Hughes’ speech of ac
ceptance.
PROMISE TO REDUCE THE
COST OF LIVING
NOT KEPT.
pur opponents promised to
reduce the cost of Iving. This
they have failed to do; but they
did reduce the opportunities of
making a living. Let us not for
get the conditions that existed
in this country under the new
tariff prior to the outbreak of
the war. Production had de
creased, business was languish
Ing. new enterprises were not
undertaken, instead of expan
sion there was curtailment, and
our streets were filled with the
unemployed. What ground is
there for expecting better con
ditions when the unhealthy
stimulus of the war has spent
its force and our industries and
working men are exposed to the
competition of an energized Eu
rope?
It is plain that we must have
protective upbuilding policies
—From Mr, Hughes’ speech of
acceptance.
WANTS AN EFFECTIVE SYS
TEM OF RURAL CREDITS.
We propose t promote by
every practicable means our
agricultural intereats, and we in
elude in this program au effec
tive system of rural credits.
We favor the wise conservation
of our natural resources. We
desire not only that they shall
ba safeguarded, but that they
shall be adequately developed
and used to the utmost public
advantage.—From Mr. Hughes’
speech of acceptance.

REAL LIFE ROMANCE
PRANK OF FATE THAT RESULTED
IN HAPPY MARRIAGE.
She Wa* the “Other Girl" and He the
Only “Good Looker" In the Regi
ment Which Wae Embarking
for War.
The scene of the first chapter of this
romance is laid In a city on the west
ern coast, a seaport from whose har
bor there sailed during the year of the
Spanish-Auierlcan war many trans
ports carrying to the Philippines
troops of gay and gallant soldiers,
most politely generous with their brass
buttons.
On one of these occasions two young
girls, thirsting for adventure, fared
forth, armed with a kodak. Snap
shots were taken of the soldiers march
ing down one of the principal streets
from the train to the wharf, but a sad
melancholy settled down upon the pair
when they were forced to admit that
these men were, Oh! so ordinary look
ing, not nearly so handsome us some
of the regiments bad been.
However, to vary the dull monotony
which the whole episode was gradual
ly assuming, they amused themselves
while the men were boarding the ship
in endeavoring to pick out the really
good-looking one. And they did —one,
and one only. But he, being by that
time on the upper deck, was quite un
attainable, so all the Joy that could
be extracted from an afternoon which
had given such promise was the pleas
ure of waving good-by to him as the
ship sailed away.
But what was their surprise when
the snapshots of the marching soldiers
were printed to discover that their
“good-looking man” appeared in one of
them. The pictures were soon pasted
into a book and the incident apparent
ly closed.
The scene of the second and closing
chapter is now shifted to a town about
ten years later.
One of the two girls was living in
this town. She was a schoolteacher.
At a social gathering she met a young
man who afterward called on her.
In the course of conversation she
gave the name of her former home,
and the young man remarked that he
hud been in that city just twice, once
when he embarked with his regiment
bound for the Philippines and once
when he was on his way back after
the war.
Of course, the old book of kodak
views was promptly unearthed, and the
girl was not a little surprised when he
greeted the picture of “the good-look
iug man,” with the rapturous an
nouncement that it was his old com
rade, Jack , who resided in that
very town, but was at that time away
on his vacation.
When he returned he would bring
him around, if he might, to see the
pictures, in which he was able to dis
tinguish many of his former friends.
Jack came, he saw, he conquered, with
the usual happy ending. lam and
was the other girl.—Chicago Tribune*
Eye Protection at Movies.
Physicians are constantly advising
patrons of the movies to protect their
eyes. A writer in the Journal of the
American Medical Association tells
how it may be done.
“The progress made In the charac
ter of subjects presented In the movies
today makes It desirable for all Inquir
ing people to at least attend occasion
ally,” he says. “Annoying after-ef
fects on the eyes of many prevent
them from enjoying the social diver
sion, and often the educational advan
tages, thus derived. The great major
ity of those who suffer from eye strain
after watching moving pictures can
find much, If not complete, relief In
perfectly fitted glasses. The picture
may not be quite so sharp, but this is
more than compensated for by the In
creased comfort.
“For those with very sensitive eyes
n colored glass, either amber, yellow
ish green or amethyst, may be neces
sary to give complete relief. There
have been put on the market recently
several varieties of colored glass, each
of which has some advantages, so that
some suitable color can usually be se
cured. A subdued light In the thea
ter is much less irritating than when
the only light visible comes from the
screen. It is also advisable to avoid
sitting in a place where it Is necessary
to look upward, as the additional
strain becomes very tiresome, and fre
quently leaves a headache.”

Freeze Feet in Midsummer.
How 150 Italian Infantrymen were
invalided by freezing their feet in mid
summer was told by a passenger arriv
ing at New York on the French liner
La Touralne.
The men were members of a batta
lion of Alpine infantry, and had gone
to a point fur above the snow line In
an attempt to surprise an Austrian
force that in no other manner could be
ousted from its position. They had
been carefully drilled in walking on all
fours and acting the parts of goats and
sheep.
Two days after leaving camp rem
nants of the command began to return.
They failed in their undertaking be
cause of a terrific storm and because
sharp pieces of Ice tore their flannel
leggings and exposed their feet.
The Reason.
“Odd, Isn’t It, that age is a recom
mendation in wine and a drawback
in women?”
“Not at all. You can put it down
In the one, but you have to put up
with it in the other.”
