V CHARLESTON, Aug. 10.?With
' conflicting reports froiu all sources in
this and neighboring counties it is
considered probable this afternoon
that no less than 125 persons lost
I their lives In the flood that swept
down from three West Virginia moun
tain streams yesterday.
Thirty-three bodies have thus far
been recovered near Cabin Creek
Junction, whilo for miles up the
stream, reports came in of the lindlng
L iof other bodies. Many bodies are be
lieved to have wushed down streams
and eventually Into the Kanawha and
Ohio rivers and probably never will
,be recovered.
J Thousands of persons made home
less are existing on the mountain
sides. One batalllon of militia from
camp Kanawha are forcing their way
.Into the devastated section with cof
'flns, cots, tents and thousands of
pounds of provisions for hungry and
'homeless. This - afternoon - they hau
[been able to penetrate no farther than
_ jnda four miles from Cabin Creek
Junction where the creek enters the
[Kanawha river. Cabin Creek valley
;la 16 miles long.
| Roads are washed out, trestles and
bridges carried awry and roadbeds or
rillroad obliterated to such extent
.that progress can only be made as
fast as a road to travel on can be im
provised.
A telephone lineman who covered
'13 miles of Cabin Creuk valley tele
phoned that 40 known dead had been
!? recovered ana that conditions further
on were much worse.
In Boone county Jarrold's valley,
r on Coal river, h reportod flood swopt
by the storm and 400 houses washed
away. No report of the loss of life
has been obtained. About 30 mines
ron Cabin Creek escaped flooding but
side tracks and tipples wero carried
[away and operators say the mines will
[be tied up 30 days. All coal contracts
have been cancelled.
An excursion tralu carrying about
400 Sundar school picnickers wrs ma
rooned between two creeks with a
; -washout on either side and a relief
train was sent from St. Albans.
All rivers and mountain streams are
, eeplng down wrecked houses logs
Nowned cattle and wreckage that in
cates a wide swept area.
Already wrecking crews and con
struction gangs are at work on rail
roads and large bridges washed away
are being replaced first, especially
along the main lino of the C. & O.
_ Camp Kanawha has been almost de
pleted of equipment provisions and
men. All blankets and cots available
and all teLts have been sent into the
stricken section with soldiers relief
department and 2500 travel ratio-s al
so were sent to sufferers.
It Is exrected it will be a wee1; or
ten days before the actual damage
will be known but there is no ex
pression of hope that the actual loss
[of life ever will be known.

Michigan Protests
Coal Rate Increase
HUNTINGTON, Aug. 10.?The next
neartngs in the coal rate case will be
heard in Detroit, commencing Seo
tember 25.
This hearing will be an important
?JJe;, The testimony of a number of
Michigan coal dealers and consumers, j
who are protesting against the increas
ed rates, will be taken before Examin
er E. C. Marshall, it is contended i
by them that the proposed increase
would add $2,500,000 per vear to the i
cost of the coal brought "from West I
Virginia mines. They join heartily
and forcibly in the contention that the j
railroads did not ask for an increase I
in the differentials because tho rail
roads needed the additional revenue,
but to meet a political exigency in
Ohio due to the threat of the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission to lower
rates on Ohio coal shipped from that
field Into Central Freight association
territory, unless the rates from the
West Virginia fields were advanced
to increase th0 differential.
West Virginia coal Is a favorite in
Michigan markets, and the dealers
there have been using it to the exclu
9h,? an^ Indiana coal, not
withstanding the oxisiting differential
of Twenty-five cents a ton. To widen
the differential an extra fifteen cent3
a ton would be be ruinous to the busi
ness and would force the Michigan
consumers to use an Inferior coal.
At this meeting the ovidence taken
in previous hearings will be summed
up and the railroads and shippers will
be given an opportunity to prepare
and submit briefs to the commission.
It is anticipated that this will be the
final hearing of the case.

HUGHES REPEIIS
Declares Country Demands
Higher Standards Than
Administration's.
(By Associated Press)
MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 10.?Charles
E. ughes, replying to Secretary Rod
field's telegram denying that E. Dana
Durand was forced out of office as
director of the census, yesterday, read
to a large audience here a letter from
Mr. Durand, in which Mr. Durand said
that he had told Redfleld he would
resign but wanted to remain, and that
Redfleld replied that the administra
tion had decided on a change,
j Mr. Durand's letter, read "by the
nominee in the course of an open-air
speech at the parade grounds here,
was in part as follows:
??Inasmuch as the truth of your
statement with regard to the change
iu the directorship of the census haj
been challenged, I think it is only fair
to you that I should make this state
ment. My resignation as director was
distinctly a forced resignation. At the
first conversation 1 had with Secre
tary Redfleld I hold him that I would
resign, but that I hoped I would be
permitted to remain. He at once
told me that the administration had
decided that it wanted to make
change. I believe 'to create a vac
ancy' were his words. The next that
that I heard of it was the announce
ment in the press that my successor
had been named and 1 at once wTOte
out my resignation."
Mr. Durand is connected with the
Minnesota School of Agriculture.
Mr. HugheB then repeated his De
troit declaration with reference to the
displacement of "an eminent scien
tists" in the coast and geodellc survey
by "an excellent stock breeder and
veterinary surgeon."
"Exception also has been taken by
the distinguished Secretary with re
gard to that man," the nominee con
tainued.
"Now, 1 am not in a position to
state of my own knowledge the Circum
stances with reference to the retire
ment of the eminet scientist who ac
cupied that important place. But if I
may assume that he retired voluntar
ily, my point is not so much the re
tirement of a man who went but the
character of man by whom he was
succeeded.
"I am now told that Mr. Jones, who
succeeded him, was promoted after
being deputy commisssioner of fisher
ies. But he was appointed to that
place, also involving the need of tech
nical skill and training, by this ad
ministration. He went there from his
stock farm and took charge of the bu
reau."
Mr. Hughes went Into detail as to
the charge he made In Detroit that
the administration had 'made a raid
upon the civil service of the United
States" and concluded as follows:
"We must have higher standards
than those of this administration. Thl*
administration with loud professions
of devotion to civil service reform at
j not been true to the standards of the
administration which I. believe the
American people desire to see en
forced."

WE I NOT TOO
PROUD TO Fid
ASSERTS HUGHES
Republican Candidate Again
Assails the Administra
tion.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug, 10?Charles
E. Hughes speaking last night in the
audiioriura here, a:-.ailed the admin
istration for its prepar: Iness policy,
which e declared inadequate, as
serted that he regained "reasonable
preparedness as a primary duty," and
purposed if Reeled "to see that is is
discharged 1 > t'te credit of the Ameri
can people."
"We ar^ a spirited pc >ple," Mr.
Hughes d< lared. "We are a people
that ran protect ourselves. We are
not too roud to fight."
Much of tre nominee's address was
devoted to the Mexican situation and
the calling of the Satio *1 Guard 'o
service on the border. There had been
warning Tor two years that America
should bo prepared, Mr. Hughes said,
yet when the time came to put an
army on the border, "to do police serv
ice," there was present' 1 "a specta
cle showing inefficiency of the first
magnitt.de."
The admin1'tration's embargo on
arms to Mexico was criticized as "fast
and loose?on policy. 1 don't think
it a rash statement," the nominee sa;d.
"I thinJ: it is warranted by the facts
to say that any America^ soldier
killed in Mexico is killed by American
bullets that we have let go over the
bord*r."
?:?<[hes referre! to a recent ad
dress 1 ?? the senate by Senat- ? Lewis
of Illinois.
"He didn't like some statements of
mine," the nominee said. "They dis
tressed him. I a: glad of it. This
was the intention, but there wasn't a
word in what I said that he or any
body else could answer."
The punitive expedition to Mexico,
Mr. Hughes said, was only called
punitive.
"The only punishment Inflicted was
punishment inflicted on ourselves,"
he said. "We punished nobody else."
Fastest Motorboat

The "VF" Earl Smith's big touring
motorboat, the largest and fastest on

when for some unknown reason it
caught fire and burned until those
wlio were on shore watched the boat
were afraid to go near fearing gaso
line explosion.
The first caught under the hood
while no one was about the craft The
boat was capable of taking the Monon
gahela Valley river at a 20-mile an
hour clip. It's loss is regretted by all
campers up the river, many of whom
have had the pleasure of using it as
well as by Mr. Smith's friends.
