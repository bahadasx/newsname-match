COTTON GKOWN ALONE IS UNPROFITABLE;
GRAIN, HAY AND LIVE STOCK ESSENTIAL
-
linc-Crop System m Agricultural Impossibility—Some Reasons.
Why It V« H Fail—Other Crops Good Credit Risks.
Cotton raising a-^ „.art of a system of farming is both a safe and a sound
business proposition 'otton farming as a business by itself is no longer safe
it profitable. To attempt to grow cotton except in conjunction with the pro
.uctlon of grain, hay and live stock is uneconomical, bad business, and ie
ound to result in disaster.
,Thc production of one crop as the main support of a people has failed in
ill of the United States. It is an agricultural impossibility. As a
.a,' ^ i h. s failed in the wheat, coin, tobacco and cotton sections of the
•ountry. in Louisiana it has signally failed in the rice and sugar-cane seo
.Ions. The one-crop practice has failed in the cotton sections for the follow*
ng reasons:
(1) Decreased soil fertility results in reduced production. Cotton being
i clean cultivated crop, this deterioration has come through the leaching out
jf the plant food in the soil by the heavy rainfall; through washing away of
the soils, and through the exhaustion of the organic matter and consequent
loss of nitrogen and bacterial life. Available plant food has become exhausted
and that mechanical condition of the soil necessary for profitable crop pro
duction destroyed. Washed and gullied hillsides, worn out and abandoned
fields haVe been the heritage of the one-crop practice in the South. Soil fer
tility is the basis of all agricultural wealth.
(2) T'he continuous growing of one crop in the same fields increase*
damage from insect pests and plant diseases.
(3) The growing of one crop to pay for all farm and household supplie*
bought on credit is uneconomical and a poor business policy. To be success
ful, the one-crop farmer must produce good crops and sell them for good
prices—a hard combination to get. Unfavorable seasons, with a poor crop,
even with high prices, or unfavorable seasons with good crops and low prices,
equally mean failure. The on«-crop farmer is at the mercy of the seasons.
All his eggs are in one basket.
Under such conditions, the cotton crop ha* been produced in Louisiana
and the rest of the South. The fault is not with the crop, for cotton has
all the qualities of an ideal farm product. It is adapted to wide range of soil
and climatic conditions, i* easy to raise and not hard on the soil, is readily
prepared for market, can be stored and held indefinitely, if necessary, and can
be turned into cash anywhere, at any time and in any quantity. The sol*
difficulty is that it is a hard crop to harvest.
The fault has been with the credit system that has been forced on th*
fanners of the South by their necessities following the Civil War. Cotton
being the sole basis of credit in the South, it has been and is still difficult
to carry out a sane diversification on the farms. The fact should be recog
nized that oat*, corn, hay, live stock, etc., are good credit risks and that th*
production of the other crops will make the growing of cotton, cane and rle*
a safe business proposition. Mason Snowden,

fHE HORN-FLY A DANGER
OUS PEST,
Irritating to Cattle, and Found to B*
a Charbon Carrier—Destroy th*
Egg or Larval Stage.
The horn-fly was Imported from Eu
ope, and since its arrival in 1887, it
îas spread all over the country.
i study of insect life, while
hey may recommend some meas
ures to destroy the mature in
jects, usually try to find out how and
-here they breed and direct their ef
orts at killing them in the immature
stages and so prevent their develop
nent. In fact, it is questionable
vhether it is possible, by simply de
stroying adults, to keep pace with
heir multiplication. On the other^
band. If these insects should be de
stroyed in the egg and larval, or grub
•tages, a material reduction in their
'.umbers might be brought about, even
f the adult flies themselves should be
left alpne. The important qaestion
therefore is, where do these horn-flies
breed? According. to the best au
.horities, this fly Jays its eggs singly,
tnd usually upon their hides, on the
■.ur/ace of wet cow manure. So far
s is known, they are laid upon no
'ther substance, and never upon old
dropping?. The moment the manure
s dropped, a swarm of flies dart from
he afiimal to the manure and remain
here a few seconds, or a minute at
he most, during which time many
ggs are deposited. Egg laying is
hiefly during daylight and most
bundant during the warmer morning
ours. After the larvae, or grubs,
iat.ch, they descend into the manure,
although remaining near the surface.
The pupa, or dormant stage of the
nsect, is found in the ground un*
lernoath the droppings. The time
vhich elapses from the egg to the
•dult stage, or fly, is from about ten
o seventeen days.
The fresh cbw droppings, then, are
he places on which these flies lay
heir eggs, and where the different
hages of the insect develop until the
all-fledged insect emerges. The most
radical „method of control, therefore,
r ould be the direct treatment of the
anure to destroy the grubs and pu
ae, and so limit the number of flies
oming to maturity;- and one of the
est agents to apply to the fresh drop
ings is lime. This may be quite
radical around buildings and yards
*"* u . Ye ' 'ï"""*
vntomologlwt», or thee wHo
•ccupied by cattle but somewhat im- ;
radical out in the open fields and |
nges, glthough it might *be possible j
) carry out this method e-. en under
:ch conditions, if the manure around j
ie places where cattle are in the ;
abit of congregating, under shade
rees, and the like. At best, it
s a trouble, but it fs not possible
o secure results without some trou
île, and if we ever expect to reduce
he numbers of these pestiferous in
lets, we will have to get after their
reeding places and troy them
here.
The arsenical soratrou uk^u tu the
lipping vats destroys large numbers
of these flies, and there are a num
ber of sprays used to repel them
from the animal, such as fish and
coal oil emulsions, the various repel
lants on the market, etc. However,
none cf these will effectually eradi
catc (he liorn-fly, while a combination
of both measures would no doubt give
the most satisfactory results. In s.d
dition to Its irritating effect on cat
tie, the horn-fiy hs 3 been found to be
a carrier of charbon infection. 1

TOMATO WILT A SERIOUS
DISEASE.
Widely Scattered Over Loulslana
H»w It May Be Identified—
Methods of'Control.
Th* appearance during the last few
years of several tomato diseases is
Louisiana, resulting in considerable
loS8> h4a caused 6 much uceas ineas
among tomato growers. Formerly,
when tomatoes were grown only on a
small scale, either for local consump*
tion or for small shipments to tne
North, there was not much chance for
the .spread of diseases. But, of late
years, conditions have been much bet
ter for the development and spread of
the diseases, on account of the larger
and more numerous fields. An increase
in the acreage of a crop is quite often
accompanied by outbrëaks of disease
or infestations by pest* that had not
been noticed before.
The Tomato Wilt "
The tomato wilt, the most serious
of the tomato diseases Is widely
scattered over the state. It absolute
ly prevents the growing of ordinary
tomato varieties in some fields in some
sections and cuts down the yield ma
terially in many of them. The disease
is produced by a fungus which live*
over from year to year In the soil, ana,
after a field is once badly infected, it
is difficult to grow tomatoes there for
a number of years. The plant affected
by the wilt disease has a more or less
stunted and sickly appearance. The
leaves turn yellow and fall off, and.
finally, the whole plant die*. Usually
a *ew fruits develop on the plants, but
they do not grow very large or ripen
normally.
If a plant affected with the wilt dis
ease Is pulled up and tne stem cut
across with a knife, the interior of the
stem will be seen to be dark colored,
or else there will be black areas in it.
These extend from the roots up to the
leaves and sometimes even out into
the petioles. The presence of these
dark colored areas is evidence or the
presence of the wilt disease. It is pri
marily a root and stem disease and
all of the damage is done in these
parts. The leaves show the effects of
the disease only after the roots and
stems are badly diseased and are un
able to function as they should.
The Control of the Disease.
Tomatoes should not be grown lr
th# same d for more than OTe
year in three If the tomato wiu ^
fage Jg preSent j n g roun d > it wir
j ncrease j n severity rapidly from yea'
t0 ar if the fleld ls kppt in t0Kl:1
toes. However, If tomatoes are plant
ed only every third year, much of th'
disease will die out duMng tbe two in
tervening years.
Transplanting from seeiTneds tna
have become infected is a very com
mon method of spreading the wilt d'a
ease. In many cases truckers us'
their seed beds or cold frames year at
ter year without changing the soil, o
at least all of it. Or they may br
filled with infected dirt. Care should
be exercised to keep the seed beds anc
cold frames free of infection.
Tne growing of wilt-resistant vane
ties or strains of tomatoes is perhap
the most satisfactory way of control;
mg thi* disease. Tomato plants evtc
i n tbe same field ao not show all 1 1
same susceptibility to the wilt, and »
saving seed from fruits on health)
plants a wilt-resi*tant variety rru y b.
evolved. This method has been suc- I
cessfully practiced at tbe Louisiaaa »
