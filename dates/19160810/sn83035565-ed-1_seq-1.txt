On last Thursday evening by
some means the barn of A. M.
Cromer on his farm adjoining
our village on the south caught
fire and was entirely consumed.
This was a large barn lately built
on irtodern plans and inflicts a
heavy loss. It was partially in
sured, but to what extent am
unable to say. The live stock
and machinery were all saved,
but the grain stored in it was
burned up. Origin of the fire is
unknown. Some, however, think
spontaneous combustion due to
the excessive heat was the cause
of the fire. One thing seems
sure, it took a very short time to
burn up or pass the danger line
to other buildings, which luckily
escaped favored Jjy a still wind
and a slate roof. The barn was
wired for electric lights and some
think the fire may have originate
ed from that source, but the ori
gin of the fire in the upper part
of the barn militates against that
theory as the lights were all in
the lower part of the barn. It
will probably Jieyer be known
how the fire- started. We all
Jcnow that a very valuable barn
was burned and one that cost
nearly $5,000 to build. The com
munity sympathizes with Mr.
Cromer in his loss.

Jt is foolish to think you can
gain a good clear complexion by
the use of face powder. Get at
the root of the trouble and thor
oughly cleanse the system with a
treatment of Dr. King's New

action, do not gripe, yet they re
lieve the liver by their action on
the bowels. Good for young, ad

Junior Fashions.
There are few better places to
study children's clothes than at a
resort frequented by modish peo
pie. At such places one sees lit
tle that is freakish or fussy in
junior attire. Practicality is in
fact the prime requisite in this
department of dress, for children
have little thought to their clothes
and the constant changes neces-
sitate many visits to the laun
dress. Then children grow so
fast, that clever mothers study
the problem of buying the smal
lest possible outfit that will keep
the child fresh and presentable,
since the next younger member
is apt to resent hand downs that
are seldom in perfect condition
when she gets them.
Wash Fabrics
are worn the year round by chil
dren of the well-to-do, and school
frocks of the winter differ little
from summer outfits and need al
most as frequent washing. Ging
ham of good quality that hold
their shape and color with the
heavier grades of tailored cottons
McCall Design
make ideal dresses of this sort.
Simplicity of cut, Very little trim
ming and great nicety jf detail
marks the attire of these children
who can have everything of thfl
best, and usually the cost is far
from low for such dainty simplic
ity, but with a few good patterns
and careful stitching duplicates
are easily made at home for a
fraction of the cost.
Sweaters and Long Coats.
Sweaters, and later, long all-
covering coats, make the light
weight washable frock as prac
tical in nipping winds as in warm
ly heated places. And the chil
dren are particularly atti active
in the brilliant hued garments
donned by all ages here this year,
when the other half of the world
wears only the colors of grief.
The coat of velours cord and
plaided or striped wool fabric
that slips over the summer frock
when cool winds blow, is all right
for early autumn wear, but later
this coat needs the warmest of
linings, plenty "of pockets and
some of the many forms of the
convertible collars, that are a
predominant feature of adult
wraps. Pile fabrics of all sorts
are to be greatly worn next sea
son, both for whole garments and
f as trimming. ' Many of the furs
are prettily reproduced in these
fabrics, and they offer great op
portunity for lengthening a too
short garment, while matching
cuffs and collars make the re
built garment fresh and up-to-date.
; re
combinations of material continue to be mod
ish, so that it is ar easy matter
to prolong thelif of an out
grown dress, by adding a little
new material which may either
match or contrast? in color and
weave. Mohair iionce more en
dorsed and there are a number
of fabrics woven either wholly or
r
partly of this wool, that make
pretty and exceptionally practic
al dresses for the youngsters,
since they shed dust and grime,
and yet are easily cleaned when
necessary. The striped and plai n
combination suits and dresses of
the summer come in vtry sjmilar
styles for fall, and coats are rath
er smarter in contrast than when
matching the dress or skirt.
Wash Crepes.
Especially pretty and practical
for the very little eirl are frocks
of white crepe weaves, in soft
dainty cotton that washes readily
and needs no ironing. A pretty
style in tne-pieea cut, buttons
continuously fron the top of the
shoulder to the e 1 of the sleeve,
and is trimmed h one of the
feather-stitched 1 ads that close-
ly'resemble hand worVr'l!alt,a'
dozen of these slips can be made
in less time than one elaborate
frock would take, and the child
looks better dressed in their sim
ple freshness than in a garment
at many times the cost. All
white is usually a most satisfac
tory choice for the littlest girl's
dress. Colored sweaters and
hats offer all the needed relief.

Astronomical Data for
August.
Venus may be seen in the mor
ning sky. At the middle of the
month it rises about three hours
before the sun and attains maxi
mum brilliancy on August 9. Ve
nus far outshines any other star
like object, and so may be iden
tified without difficulty. Mars
may be seen in the evening sky
during the month, but will be an
inconspicuous object in the south
west not far from Spica, the
brightest star in Virgo. At the
middle of the month Jupiter will
rise a little before 10 o'clock in
the evening (local time). There
i3 no vefy bright star in its im
mediate vicinity, and its bright
ness enables one to identify it
without difficulty.
Saturn will be too near the sun
for easy observation the first of
the month; but toward the last
of the month it may be seen in
the morning sky, when it will
rise about three hours before the
sun. It will be not far from Cas
tor and Pollux and almost direct
ly south from Pollux,
Toward the last of the month,
when the moon gets out of the
way, the Milky Way will be con
spicuous in the evening. At a
bout 10 o'clock it will stretch a
cross the sky from northeast to
southwest, paspinsr pretty nearly
throughlthe" zenith. ' It cannot
be seen to advantage unless one
goes where the sky is free from
smoke and the glare of artificial
lights. The telescope confirms
what had been surmised long be
fore its invention: that the Milky
Way is made up of a large num
ber of stars too faint to be seen
as individual stars by the naked
eye. It is safe to say that our
universe of stars has its greatest
extension in the direction of the
Milky Way, but the question of
the strjeture and distance of the
Milky Way is a difficult one to
investigate. It has been estim
ated, although the figures are not
entitled to any high degree of
confidence, that its -nearer por
tions are so distant that it takes
light over 15,000 years to pass
from these regions tp the earth;
and since there is reason to sup
pose that the Milky Way has a
considerable depth, its more re
mote portions are probably far
more distant still. Ohio State

Hughes Points the Way
The speecb of the Republican candi
date for president wax a keynote
Bpeech Indeed. Not one person in the
great audience at the Carnegie hull
meeting was in doubt for one moment
as to Just what he mount By every
thing h t said.
His address was comprehensive, logi
cal, clear and all sufflduut for the oc
casion. There can be no dispute as to
this. Plainly Mr. Hughes is a man
who "knows what he wants when he
wants it," and it is the opinion of po
litical authorities who heard him and
who have since read his remarks that
he knows also bow to get it.
It was incumbent upon the Republi
can candidate to con tine tne scope of
bis remarks to the limitations of tlie
occasion, but his crushing analysis of
the shortcomings of the present ad
ministration of the government is
merely an earnest of what the tone
and the contents of his speeches will
be When he gets on the stump.
At Curnegic . hall Mr. Hughes ad
verted to every general question that
is apt to be a serious issue in the cam
paign and in luiiguuc:e that will be
absolutely clear to e.very man or wo
man able to road be stated his opin
ions, his convictions and bis purposes.
On the stump he will argue those
points in detail. As an orator he is
eloquent, his iwrsouality attractive,
and his marshaling of facts so co
hesive that he holds his audience to
the nd. He makes it easy for them
to follow him. and his points are not
lost.
There was nothing equivocal, noth
ing apologetic in the Republican can
didate's speech of acceptance. He
called a spade a spade, and the unani
mous opinion of those who heard him
was that he shot to the center and
rang the bell. The Republican cam
paign Is now open, and those who will
speak and write and work for the suc
cess of the Republican ticket can wish
for no more adequate campaign docu
ment, no more satisfactory statement
of issues than are found in the candi
date's salutatory.

CONSPIRACIES.
We denounce all plots and

any foreign nation. Utterly in
tolerable is the use of our soil
for alien intrigues. Every Amer
ican must unreservedly con
demn them and support every
effort for their suppression. But
here also prompt, vigorous and
adequate measures on the part
of the administration were need

wise and politic to delay. Such

the administration bad notice of
plots and conspiracies it was its
duty to stop them. It was not
lacking in resources. Its re

condemnation of others. Prom '

COST OF LIVING
NOT KEPT.
Our opponents promised to re
duce the cost of living. This
they have failed to do. But they
did reduce the opportunities of
making a living. Let us not for
get the conditions that existed in
this country under the new tariff
prior to the outbreak of the war.
Production had decreased, busi
ness was languishing, new enter
prises were not undertaken, in
stead of 'expansion there was
curtailment and our streets were
filled with the unemployed. What
ground Is there for expecting
better conditions' when the un
healthy stimulus of the war has
spent its force and our industries
and workingmen are exposed to
the competition of an energized
Europe?
It is plain that we must have

WHAT ONE BIO MAN
THINKS OF ANOTHER.
President W. H. P. Func of
Brown university is a pretty liv
wire who keeps abreast of the
times, has keen powers of obser
vation and knows good man
when he eees him. Her is what
he has to say about the Repub
lican candidate for the presi
dency: "I have known Justice Hughes
intimately since we were stu
dents together at Brown and
havo seen him a thousand times
at work and at play. No man of
our generation has finer com
bination of character and intel
lect. A fcsolirtoty fearless, unself
ish, loyal to American ideals, he
is worthy of a nation's trust.
"All his friends know that be
hind the dignity of bearing is m
rich fund of humor nd good fel
lowship. Whether ha is climbing
a mountain, reading novels, play
ing with his children, resisting a
political lobby or delivering the
opinion of the supreme court, he
is ever the same rugged, demo
cratic, fair minded American.
His varied experience has given
him wide horizon and sympa
thy with every aspect of Ameri
can life.
"He possesses two .qualities
raroly found together the judi
cial temper and the capacity for
ewift and resolute action. Un
der his administration the fog
which now besete many public
questions would be cleared away.
"His penetrating mind goes to
the heart of any aubject he se
lects and strips off the irrelevant
at once. Such a mind ia pecul
iarly needed amid the intricate
problems that now confront
America.
"We need more than good in
tentions. We need clear vision,
sound judgment, strong will, un
hesitating decision. In short, we
need Charles E. Hughes."

D THE MAN.
"AMERICA FIRST AND AMER
ICA EFFICIENT."
We come to state in a plain
and direct manner our faith, our
purpose and our pledge. This
representative gathering is a
happy augury. It means the
strength of reunion. It means
that the party of Lincoln is re
stored, alert, effective. It means
the unity of a common percep
tion of paramount national
needs. It means that we ar
neither deceived nor benumbed
by abnormal conditions. We
know that we are in a critical
period, perhaps more critical
than any period since the civil
war. We need a dominant
sense of national unity, the ex
ercise of our best constructive
powers, the vigor and resource
fulness of a quickened America.
We desire that the Republican
party as a great liberty party
shall be the agency of national
achievement, the organ of the
effective expression of dominant
Americanism.. What do I mean
by that? I mean America con
scious of power, awake to obli
gation, erect in self respect, pre
pared for every emergency, de
voted to the ideals of peace, in
stinct with the epirit of human
brotherhood, safeguarding both
individual opportunity and the
public interest, maintaining a
well ordered conetitutional sys
tem adapted to local eelf gov
ernment without the sacrifice of
essential national authority, ap
preciating the necessity of sta
bility, expert knowledge and
thorough organization aa the in
dispensable conditions of secu
rity and progress; a country
loved by Its citizens with a pa
triotic fervor permitting no divi
sion in their allegiance and no
rivals in their affection I mean
America first and America effi
cient. It is in this spirit that
I respond to your summons.
