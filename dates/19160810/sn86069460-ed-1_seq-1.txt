BOYS AND GIRLS
NEED TO PLAY
It Very Necessary For Their Mora)
Mental And Physical De
velopement. (By Mug. Verlie C. Koltinsky)
It is as necessary that every
chilJ shall have a place to play as
that every child shall have a
place to go to school, and this
right to play is equally as funda
mental and important as is the
riht to go to school. Without
Jucation a child may grow up
healthy, goad and happy, but with
out play he will be none of thes.
Perhaps we often forjret the sen
tence in the Declaration of Inde
pendence in which onr forefath
er gave what tv?y regarded as
b.i!ic human rights in these words
"We hold these truths to be self-
evident: That all men are created j
equal: that they are endowed by I
their Creator with certain inal
ienable rights: that among these
are life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness." The government
which we have created protects
life and liberty, but in the case
of children at least, it does not
give adequate protection in the
pursuit of happiness. Play is es
sentially the pursuit of happiness
and is, hence, a fundamental hu
man right
Life seems to be made up main
ly of three things: Work, love
and play. Work we have organ
ized Fp'endidly, and law is be
ginning to protect it admirably;
love has its great opportunity in
the home; tut play, equally fun
damental and important, equally
a matter of human Interest, we
have left largely to private or
ganizations and commercial agen
cies. The value of play can be
ctnsidered from three stand
points: The physical, mental and
moral development it furnishes.
For their physical development
children r.ecd spirited, playful ex
erciie which utilizes in an instruc
tive way the large muscular
masses that effect respiration,
digestion and excretion; which
tone up the whole body through
graceful, child-like abandon. The
child's desire for play leads
him unconsciously into an active,
spirited; rythmical use of his
large fundamental muscles. If
young children lived in an ideal
atmosphere where there was no
Interference with the wise plans
of nature the question of exer
cise would solve itself uncon
sciously in play, for play is the
guardian of the chi'd's physical
health and furnishes the normal
stimulus to the various organs and
nerve centers of the body. Phy
will neither allow the muscles of
the body to become flabby nor
develop them in technical skill,
but will establish that balance
between exercise and rest which
result in the harmonious devel
opment of all its parts.
The great mental value derived from
the proper kind of play it of immente
Importance alto. In many garnet In
which children commonly engage, it it
exceedingly neceetary that their tente
organt act very quickly and readily.
Memory and imagination alto receive
important training in many garnet and
are developed to large extent In thia
way. Good sound judgment it a qual
ity which it rewarded very often in
play. In order that thia may be mani
rented the child mutt be able to quickly
and accurately decide on pointa that
oo-ne up in the play. The will alto, or
volitional tidt of hit nature it being
uted conttantly and develop! remarka
bly in many garnet.
Another great tervice that play ren
drt the child it ita moral value. Here
the expretaion, "Honeety it the Bent
Policy, " ie manifetled to them more
forcibly nerhapa than in any other way.
Truthfullncae it another virtue that it
Wilson Signs Forly-Two Million
Dollar River and Harbor Bill
Washington, July 27.-Wi:ha
silver and gold pen presented by
Represntative Alben W. Barkeley
President Wilson today signed
the $42,000,000 Rivers and Har

the leading advocates of Cumber
land river improvements.
The Rivers and Harbjrs Bill
carries an appropriation of $200,
000 to begin work on the last lock
in the Cumberland river; it will
be located at Eddvville and will
be the last link in the canaliza
tion of that stream: the Eddy villa
dam will mean completion of the
work from Nashville to the mouth
of the Cumberland. Mr. Mason,
who will receive the pen, was
mayor of Eddyville for several
vears and was one of the dele

er Improvement Association at
two national congresses of River
and Harbor Improvement advo-
catcg
Mr. Mason is Vice Pres-
jdent of ,he Cumbcrland River

encouraged in all came. Promptitude
it a very neceuary quality and the child
teet that without thia be can gain prac
tically nothing in the way of victory.
UntelAihnett, a virtue very much to be
detired in all children it developed in
many way i through different kind of
pity. The child learnt to co-operate
with other children and realizet that
they have the tame right! to a "tquare
deal" at he himself. Alto, he learnt
that he mutt Uke defeat at cheerfully
at he gaina victory. In playing in a
team where it it of the greatest import
ance that all work together thought
fully and pertiitently, telf control it a
quality which mutt be given great at
tention; the child that learnt to control
himself well on the playground can con
trol himtelf equally at well in other af
fairs of life, and therefore thit thould
be intitted upon and encouraged by the
j,e"b'r
Now we tee that pity givet ttrength,
courage and confidence, and maket the
child energetic, quick to decide, and
ready to act At he growt toward mi-
tirity the playt in which he it interett
j change their nature decidedly. At
about twelve the boy begin! to take ac
tive interett in gamee of an athletic na
ture and to think more of playing in
company with other boyi He delightt
in teamt which act In obedience to a
captain and which ttruggle together
for victory. Whether alone or in com
pany with other, competition it a pow
erful motive, and the greateat pleat
ore that a boy can feel it in overcoming
tome other peraoo.
The greateat obetacle to the prog rest
and development of the playground
movement it the ditcontinuity of mem
ory. Few pertont over thirty remem
ber the feelingi and motivet which gov
erned them at ten. Childhood haa to
moat pertont become a doted book;
moet adulu think of play at rett and
recreation. They can no longer remem
ber that play it life to the child, and
that a child playing intentely needt
rett and recreation at much at anyone.
We keep thinilng of pit at a by-activity,
whereat tchool, work and taaki

OFFERS NO SUGGESTION
Without intending to offetid we
feel justified in charging that in
no single public utterance have
yoa filed a bona fide bill of par-
ticulars, nor have you offered a
single constructive suggestion.
Generalities are witnout value.
Blanket criticism is worthless.
What we desire to know, what is
fair that the electorate should
know, are the exat details of your
disagreement with Mr. Wilton.
What has he done that you would
not have done, and what has he
failed to do that you would have
done or propose to do? Honesty
and patriotism demand thtt you
put yourself on record in such a
manner as to permit people to
judge you as they are now able
to judge President Wilson. For
example:

protest with the United States

to talk about action that would
have prevented the Luitania trag

that civilization has made the
world regard as incredible. The
only honest question is this:

most everyone, especially to Ken
tucky politicians, and the Cafe
at the Old Inn is unquestionably
the best eating place in Louisville.
Anyone wanting a real good
steak or fresh sea food of any
kind should visit the Old Inn
Cafe. Both hotels have hot and
cold running water and telephone
in every room, and anyone stop
ping at either of the hotels is as
sured of the very best of service
and reasonable rates. Some ho
tels have adopted such exorbi
tont rates as to prohibit anyone
except millionaires, but the above
hotel has quarters luxurious
enough lor a Kocke feller or a
Gould, and at the same timeoth
comfortable quarters at lower
rates.

Ninth-What are jour specific

Tenth-As Governor of New
York you opposed the Income Tax
amendment Does this antago
nism persist? Do you or do you
not believe in paying for prepar
edness out of tax on incomes, in
heritances and munitions?
We agree with you that it is
a "critical period, " by far too crit
ical indeed for candidates to talk
in terms of office-seeking rather
than in the simple, earnest lan
guage of definite Americanism.

Herschel Franklin III.
Herschel O. Franklin who was
in Louisville last February to
consult a specialist in regard to
the condition of his health, was
taken dangerously ill again, last
Wednesday. His home physi
cian, Dr. J. R. Ferry, was called
at once and soon gave him some
relief.
Herschel had begun teaching
school at Deer, Creek the Mon
day before, and he and all the
patrons were very much pleased
the way things moved off the
first three days but owing to the
general nervous break down he
had to give up the school work.
He is now at his home, near
Fords Feny and receiving the
very best of medical attention
and his many friends hope he!
will soon be able to be out again.

they went Friday to accompany
Mrs. Redd and three children,
