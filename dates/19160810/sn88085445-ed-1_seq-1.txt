Vol. IX
HALF VOTERS FAIL
TO REGISTER EARLY
Although but three weeks matin
until (he books close prior to the
primary, less than half of Lyuden's
voters have registered, ami the
same state of affairs exists in the
country precincts. With the liquor
question coming before the voters
again, and a president, a senator,
a congressman and a governor to
elect, in addition to nfnor State
and County officers, a rush to reg
ister is expected before September
1, as every one who holds the fran
chise will be anxious to exercise It
this year.
One hundred and eighty-eight
had registered at the City Clerk s
office up to the time of going to
press this afternoon. Four hundred
Ifand nine votes were east ut the
f *lectioii two years ago.
llt is this 409 votes that will
double Lynden's electiou expense
this year. A law passed last year
by the legislature requires the di
vision of a district with more than
four hundred votes into iwo pre
cincts. Lynden just barely .>x ced
ed the total, so the county commis
sioners have ordeied the division,
and all voters east of Fifth Street
will do their balloting at the City
Hall, all west at some other 'oca- t
tiou batWe<n Fifth and Seventh.

He Tells What Milk Costs
That, it costs the farmer $1.83
and more per hundred pounds to
produce milk, is the statement made
this month by James N.. Mcßride,
Michigan Director of Matfcets.
"1 ho cost figures for nii'.k pro
-I'iced by twenty-five herds iv the
vicinity of Howell, Livingston Coun
y, Michigan, during the months of
March and April of this year BhOW
hat the average cost for each 100
pounds of milk for March was $1.83
and for the month of April $1.84,"
*ys Mcßride. "The twenty-five
letds for the March Investigations
Included 487 cows and for the April
investigations 523 cows. The iig
ures were obtained as the result • f
ibservations and measurements
■cade by Peld investigators from
the Michigan Agricultural College.
"The selling figures for milk sold
tv the owners of the herds for the
lane months are also availab'e.
I'lley aro, March, $1.52, Apr I , $1 -
14. The loss to the growers was
herefore 31 cents for each 100
pounds for March, and 40 cents
i'or each 100 pounds for April.
"The average total cost of >at h
tow was $13.99 fo.-*\pril and the
iverage yield for each cow was G7 9
;iomi(ls.
"One reason that the dairy in
luEtry can prevail tinder such un
favorable conditions is because a
large part of the labor cost is iin
>aid overtime, and unpaid woman
md child labor."

Nation Should Prepare
For the Conservation
of Our Present
Prosperity
By ELBERT H. GARY. Chairman of the United
States Steel Corporation
THE close of the war will not Immediately check our prosperity, al
though undoubtedly a largo number of the men now working in
munition factories will be compelled within a few months to sock
other employment Our business is progressing at such a rate that its
very momentum will curry on for some time to come, but I do not a<rce
with the statements which have been made that at the close of the "war
we may expect in this country a prolonged continuance of the great
prosperity now existing.
THEREFORE I THINK THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE MORE
OR LESS TEMPORARY CHARACTER OF OUR PROSPERITY AND PRE
PARE OURSELVES FOR ITS CONSERVATION.
The business men of the country must give no cause for complaint in
the management of their affairs, ami by thus acting they can and should
insist that the government, with all its agencies and influence, co-operate
with them and aid them in establishing credit, in extending commerce,
in increasing capacity and in the development of natural resources.
We must be prepared for radical changes in volume, in prices and in
resources. There is danger of overproduction, overextension of credit
and liability, overconiideiice. Business men should realize there is pos
sible danger ahead and should proceed with cautious aggressiveness.
With its great and increasing wealth, its natural resources, its productive
capacity,'its location and witli a well defined and settled policy IT IS
IMPOSSfP.EE TO MEASURE THE FUTURE GROWTH AND
STRENGTH OF THE UNITED STATES.

to enter, the others being \V. E.
Humphrey, congressman from Se

MEETS SUCCESS IN
GROWING ALFALFA
An experiment in alfalfa grow
ing that is proving so successful
that It is attracting the attention
of a considerable number of farmers
throughout the county is being con
ducted by Russel Cries on his
ranch on the Po inder road south
east of Lynden. Gries planted five
eighths of an acre to alfalfa a year
aeo. and this year he will harvest
more than five tons of hay.
So impressed are several farmers
with the success of the Gries meth
ods that next Spring, there will be
a number of similar experimental
patches planted on both river-bot
tom and upland. The importance lo
the district should the growing of
alfa'fa 1 permanently be establiahed
cannot be overestimated, as it would
give the farmers a hay crop for
dairy feed nearly doub c in value of
anything they now possess.
"As we came from a part of Cali
fornia where alfalfa was grown
quite extensive y and grew on al
most any kind of soil and some
very poor soil, we thought that it
wou'd grow here," said Mr. Gries
today. "So we planted four acrea
three years ago this fall but it did
uot do very wel\ We put 300
pounds of ground limestone on a
small portion at one end of the
lield and the alfalfa came out quite
well there.
"A year from the following
siring we n owed the whole field
tnd put In barley and that fall wo
plowed it again and put in rye and
vetch. There is still quite a bunch
ot Alfa fa growing where we put
tbe lime but on no other place.
From this it appaarg as though the
"ime is a necessity for alfa fa. We
ilso inoculated the seed.
"A year ago this spring we de
cided to try the a falfa again ao wo
Uarted to prepare a litfef more
than an acre near the barn. We
manured it quite well and plowed
it under and then some three weeks
at so before time to plant we put
m a ton of hydrated lime. This
:ost us $10.00 for the ton.
"This was disked well but not
plowed for the lime should be near
ihe surface. We tried some com
mon seed the first time so this
time we sent east for some seed
that had been tested and tried by
■he Government and to Pullman for
some inoculation. The seed, 12
pounds, cost 90 cts. a pound;' the
inoculation, 50 cts., enough for
three acres, hut we used it a l on
the half-acre. This seed was plant
ed about the first of May without
a nurse crop.
"Last year the weeds were real
bad and we did not get any hay
but this year we have just cut our
second crop and it is very thick.
We expect to make another cutting,
so that the total crop will be over
five tons.
"1 think that spring planting is
much better, than fall on account
of our hard winters. The soil
should he well drained, at least 10
feet to water but 20 to 30 would be
much better.
"W e get our pure Grimm Alfalfa
seed from It. B. Lyman. Excelsior,
Minn., Alfalfadale Farm.
"Our total costs, Including the
lt.noculation. lime, and need, ran
about |22. This winter, we will
run the manure spreader over the
half-acre, and will harrow it light
ly in the spring to loosen, the
ground. There is no quaation in
my mind but what the alfalfa la
tnere to stay, as the results with
that planted three years ago with
the limestone, and the fact that the
present crop endured through last
winter which was exceptionally se
vere, shows that |t will last."
Farmers who are Interested
should plan to visit the Gries ranch
next week, when the crop will he
considerably advanced.
