ed that they are brother and sis
ter. Newman whose real name
is George Porter, was placed in
an orphanage at Spokane, Wash.,
in 1880; owing to financial re
verses of his parents. He was
adopted by a family that moved
to the east and his parents lost
all trace of him. His adopted
parents gave him a good educa
tion and later he returned to the
Pacific northwest, where h e
engaged in the insurance busi
ness. It was while living in
Portland that he met his sister,
who was attending a girls' semi
nary there. Entirely unsuspect
ing that they were relatives, the
pair became infatuated and later
were married.
Recently while he was search
ing through an old trunk New
ton found an old locket contain
ing a tintype of his parents.
When he showed it to his wife
she recognized her own father
and mother and then fainted
completely away. The Porters,
who have been residents of Globe
for the past four months, are on
their way to Eugene, Oregon, to
visit their parents

Prof. Parke was here Tuesday
and gave canning demonstrations
at the academy to the members
of the canning club. In the
evening he 'also held a meeting at
which he lectured on the same
subject. The lecture was quite
interesting and instructive. The
.only thing that was lacking was
the "lack of attendance, on .the
part of a great many of our citi
I zens.
A Contemptible Practice.
One of the most contemptible
things that has ever come to our
attention was the hiring of two
Los Angeles detectives to induce
men to break the prohibition law.
The county authorities may
have been jnstified in hiring
these pups to run down boot
leggers, but the. detectives soon
found out that bootleggers were
a scarce article in this county so
they bestirred themselves in an
effort to make men break the
law that they might have a
number of arrests to show for
their work.
These individuals went about
coaxing and begging men to sell
them whiskey, one of them using
the plea that he was a sick man
and had to have the liquor to
live. When the prospective
victim replied that he had no
liquor to sell then the detective
stated that he was a stranger in
town and would ( appreciate it if
the person to whom he was talk
ing would take his money and
scout around for a bottle of
whiskey. Very often this was
done, and as soon as the liquor
was returned to the "sick
stranger" the man who procured
it for him was arrested for boot
legging, It is hardly necessary for us to
give our opinion of the two detec
tives. A man who would be a
detective in the first place has
something wrong with him, and
when he becomes a sneak, a liar
and a hypocrite he gets so far
below the line of common decency
that the dogs should make the
same use of him they do of the
corner telegraph pole.
The authorities of this county
would be just as much in the
right if they hired men to go out
over the county and solicit men
to commit murder or rob or burn
as they were in hiring these, two
pups to solicitpeople to break the
prohibition law. The law against
the sale of liquor is the same as
the law against any other crime,
and it ill becomes the county to
solicit people to break these laws.

Forest Service Lays Out Lots
for Summer Cottages in Lee
Valley, Each Served by
Mountain Springs
Springer yille, Arizona,
August, 9, 1916.
Forest Officers here have com
pleted the survey of a number
of summer home sites in Lee
Valley near Greer, Arizona,
which they claim offer exception
al opportunities for city folks in
search of rest and recreation. The
lots overlook a beautiful mountain
valley and are within easy dis
tance of the town of Greer, where
postoffice facilities and farm
products are obtainable. The
little Colorado Riv9r, an excellent
trout stream, is close by. An
extraordinary feature of the loca
tion is that nine consecutive lots
are each served by nice separate
springs, so situated that water
can be easily piped into each
cottage at a negligible expense.
In spite of the distance from
railway transportation, it is be
lieved here that these lots will at
tract people in search of a good
location for a summer home.
The Old Trails transcontinental
highway is only a few miles dis
tant. Local Forest officials state that
these lots are now available under
long term leases, and that ap
plicants will be served-in order
of application. The annual
rentals are said to be nominal.
Additional lots will be laid out on
application anywhere in the
White Mountain region.
The Best Laxative.
To keep the bowels, regular the
best laxative is outdoor exercise
Drink a full glass of water half
an hour before breakfast and eat
and abundance of fruit and. yege-.
tables, also establish a regular
habit and be. sure that your
bowels move once each day
When a medicine is needed .take
Chamberlain's Tablets. They
are pleasant to take and mild and
gentle in effect. Obtainable
everywhere. Adv.

The Dreamers
The bugaboo of socialism held
up before the voters of Arizona
in this campaign to secure votes
is ridiculous. We at one time
thought socialism a menace to
this republic, but after hearing
their speakers and coming some
what in contact with members of
that party we find there is a
thousand times more danger to be
found in the mining companies of
the state and their hirelings than
there is in socialism. The truth
of the matter is that socialists
are clean, honest people, but
dreamers. Every reader of histo
ry in the world knows that the
great: things, of-the earth came
from' dreamersteDtmbar's.Week-
ly.
