The sidewalks in all parts of Bo
galusa are going to be placed in
first-class condition as a result of
complaints coming before the spe
cial session of the Commission
Council last Monday, and Commis
sioner Cowgill will give property
owners who have bad sidewalks but
very few hours to have them placed
in good condition. If not the city
will assume the work and, according
to Mr. Cowgill, it would be much
cheaper for the property owners to
have the city make the repairs.
North Bogalusa will receive atten
tion this week. Mayor Sullivan an
nounced that the sidewalks in South
Bogalusa were already being placed
in fine condition.

MORE MONEY Ti LOIHERE I
AS RESULT OF NEW LAW
The new state banking law which
went into effect Monday will mean I
that the local banks will have sev- I
eral thousand dollars more to lend
in the future. The new law permits
the state banks to loan an equal
per cent of their deposits as the
º National banks and the additional
5 per cent which the local banks can
now lend will permit them to loan
) several thousand dollars more than
r before. However there has been
i plenty of money in Bogalusa for
t the past several months and depos
e its have been steadily increasing
r which shows that Bogalusa is en
P joying unusual prosperity.

denied that the letter he received on
Thursday was the cause of him
taking the drug and later denied
that he did receive a letter. On Sat
urday he was removed from the
Headley Hotel to the Bogalusa
Hospital where he died Saturday
evening from pneumonia and the
effects of the drug. The remains

to the state officials that Bogalusa

busy as ever, and has secured the ii

ICETO BE WEIGHEO
HERE IN THE FUTURE
Dealers Decide Upon This
Plan On Account Of
Troubles In N. O.
As a result of the question of
short weights in nearby cities, M.
K. Pearce, of the Ozone Ice Co, has
announced that just as soon as
scales arrive they will be carried on
wagons which supply ice to patrons
from his plant. One of the first
ordinances passed by the Commis
sion Council was the Weight and
Measure Ordinance No. 35, which
states that any patron buying ice,
coal or wood could have same
weighed or measured. No case has
ever been reported against any ice
dealer in Bogalusa failing to com
f ply with a request to have the ice
weighed. If anyone has any doubts
as to the weight of his ice he can
demand that it be weighed in his
d presence and upon failure to do so
he can have any dealer arrested
under the ordinance.
"Weighing ice is not such an easy
matter to get the exact weight. Two
or three pounds too little works an
inconvenience on both the dealer
and the consumer," said Mr. Pearce,
r "bhut rather than have any com
- I plaints I am going to do my utmost
in to please myv patrons who are my
so friend s."
e- The service rendered by this com
pany, which has always been con
as sidered equal to any, will be main
ý tained and improved if possible..
