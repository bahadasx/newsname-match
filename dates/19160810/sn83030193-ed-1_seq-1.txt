MURPHY PLAYING A GAME OF

Charlei F. Murphy spent most of
the morntng on tho front porch of thn
hotel greeting tho up-Stnte men ns
they arrived. Ho seemed to have,
curiosity as to their views, but no
arguments to offer. From tho talk In
the groups which flanked him It was
qulto apparent that the Tammany
men did not want to bo put on record
as Influencing tho result of this two
days' pow-wow. They havo taken
their hands off.
They view with grimly humorous
'alarm their prospects for Stato
patronage. Hhould Senbury be
nominated, they can sco noth
ing int his candidacy from
t which they expect nourish
ment. But every one of them
whose name means authority Is toll
ing his friends that beabury Is tho
best vote getter In sight for thn
Metropolitan District.
Last night there were hints that
Seabury was an "Economic Hadlcal,"
whatever that is, and was "Social
iatlcally friendly to Iabor." Also
that he would arouso religious con

Big Broadway Noonday Crowd

Jump to His Death.
LANDED, ACROSS STREET
Death Came When He Hil
Coping at 13th Floor

Albert G-nldman of No. r,5: Kast
Fourteenth Streot, llrooklyn, Jumped
from the forty-second floor In tho
tower of tho Singor llulldlng, a helgnt
of more than 500 feet, at noon to-day,
his desperate act and appalling death
giving thousands of pirsons throng
ing Hroadway nt the luncheon hour
a shock that it will take them some
days to get over.
Hundreds heard, the man's body
strlko tho coping on tho thirteenth
tloor In Its descent from tho tower
ajid Rooked up,Jov tiwe to see him
crushed to death. Several women In
tho crowd swooned. Tho body after '
glancing off tho coping landed on tho
opHislto sldo of Hroadway.
A letter from thn Montcfloro Home'
and Hospital nnd nn unsigned will
found In (lolilman's pockets told
t)ie story and made clear that his mil-
cldo was dellborato long boforo the
pollco learnrd from his relatives that
ho had been threatening to destroy
himself for some time pnst. He wnn
seventy yenrs old nnd was a sufferer
from nsthmn and stomach trouble.
The only man who saw him start on
his death Journey was Jnmos Gal
lagher, nn attendant In chargo of the
observation platform In tho Singer
Dulldlng tower.
According to tho elevator oporator
who took Goldman to tho tower about
half past cloven, after he had paid
tho necessary fifty cents, thero was
nothing in his manner to Indlcnto he
contemplated making tho plungo.
(Inllagher corroborates thn elavator
nuiii ns to (loldman's unusually calm
conduct. Gallagher says that after
reaching tho tower Goldman stood
drinking In tho sights of the city for
at least half an hour. Ho says tho
man actually smiled ns ho alluded
to objects along the skyline.
Subsequent events howed Goldman
was evidently trying to disarm Gal
lagher'a suspicions, for the moment
tho attendant got far enough away
from hlin Ooldman climbed over thn
four and one-half foot guard rail,
reaching the other side Just as Gal
laghor turned and divined his Inten
tions. MADE JUMP AFTER FAREWELL
LOOK AROUND HIM.
Gallagher ordored him back In a
quiet tono. Goldman turned onca and
looked at the attendant, swept the
horizon with a farewell glancn and
then Jumped Into space,
At tho thirteenth floor, where tho
tower leaves thu main structure,
Goldman's body hit thu roof with such
force as to loosen tho slats and parts
of the roncrote, theso falling particles
warning those they struck In tho
street below to look up.
The body, following the Impact with
the roof bounced out Into the air clear
across Hroadway, landlns In the gutter
on tho far sldu of the street and Just
missing an opon cnr filled ulth women,
The screams set up by these women,
together with tho ;rles of those who
had seen the finish of Goldman's fall
drew tho crowds from all the sld'i
streets nndla a few minutes Ilioad-
way for bluuks on either side o( tho

ROME, Aug. to. King Victor Emmanuel of Italy, riding beside
the Duke of Aosta, who Is his cousin and commander of the Third, Army,
led the entry of the victorious Italian troops Into Gorizia after the forcing
of the bridge across the Isonzo. They were followed by the cavalry and
the cycle corps. The Duke was will) Jfo fopff duffogJl1 lhrgg.jJfr.

The Austrian aviation station of Aisovlzza, six miles cast of Gorizia,
iias been captured by Italian Iroops, who are continuing the pursuit of
the Austrian force that retreated from the fortified city
Strong Austrian intrenchments northeast of Monte San Michele, near
the village of San Martino, have been pierced by the Italians. They have
occupied Doschlnl.
The number of prisoners taken so far on the Gorizia front is reported
as 21,750. Guns and other booty have not been counted. As an indica
tion of the determined character of the struggle it is stated that in the last
fourteen montlis San Michele has been taken and retaken t'inty-five
times. For, seven months the Italians have held one-half of the summit.
The Italians are seeking to cut off and capture the Austrian naval and
commercial bases on the Istrian Peninsula. With the advance of the
army there looms more and more strongly the probability that the mili
tary success will compel the Austrian fleet to leave Poia, and either give
battle or strike its colors to the allied fleets.
At the same time, the Italians are pushing heavily against the
Austrians in the Trcntino. Military authorities say that a short advance
against the Austrians on the Adige River will open the way for extended
operations agains1 Ruvereto and even Trent itself.

MANY WOUNDED AND DYING.
AUSTRIANS IN OUT8KIRT8.
After taking the mountain tops of
Man Michele and Snbotlno, the army
attacked Gorizia not only from th
front, u cross thu Isonzo, but also from
tho sides and rear. When tho Italian
King und tho Duke of Aosta entered
tho city at thn head of cavalry and
cycle corps, Gurlzlu was found to be
deserted save by great number of
wounded und dying Austrians on the
outskirts.
Tho only damage done by the Aus
trians was that occasioned by their
attempts to destroy military build
ings tilled with large quantities of
supplies.
The lighting at the bridge across
the Isonzo at Podgora, leading Into
Gorizia, was among tho most san
guinary episodes of tho war. Before
this encounter tho bridge had bten
named Death Pass. After the Italian
guns had obtained coniL.aiid of Oor

San Michele, Monto Fortln, Monte

After tho wildest righting, In which
many Austrians were drowned, the
bridge was taken. Entrance to the
city was then comparatively easy.
