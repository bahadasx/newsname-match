MASS MEETING OF UNIONS
Industrial Council Members
Saturday Evening.
"Thirty-Five Cent Gas Won't
Work Hardship" J. W. Kelley.
Governor Capper announced this
afternoon that he will ask S. M. Brew
ster, attorney general, to bring suit to
dlmniss the Kansas Natural Gas com
pany receivership unless the new mini
mum rate be reduced. The matter
will be taken up with the attorney
general when he returns from a trip
to Troy.
Aroused because of the 100 per cent
Increase In the minimum' rate for gas.
Governor Capper today declared that
drastic action would be taken to curb
the gas company. The action contem
plated by the governor would mean a
motion to dismiss the suits now pend
ing before Judge Flannelly in Mont
gomery county. The action means a
step toward formal dismissal of the
receivership.
Recently John M. Landon, receiver
for the gas company, announced that
the minimum rate for gas would be
Increased from 50 cents to $1 a month.
The flat rate for gas would also be
increased from 28 cents to 35 cents a
thousand feet. This action was taken
under a ruling of the federal court
when the gas company provided a
bond to protect patrons against a gas
rate raise.
"As I see it now, this is the only
thing the state can do in the gas case,"
said Governor Capper. "Mr. Brewster,
- ho is at his home, will return to To
prka In a few days and I will put the
matter up to him."
Call Mass Meeting.
Thousands of bills and placards an
nouncing a public mass meeting over
the hike In gas prices, to be held Sat
urday evening on Capitol square, will
be distributed over town tomorrow.
The meeting will be called under the
auspices of the Topeka Industrial
council, according to Frank Brown,
president-elect of the council.
The Industrial council Willi probably
endeavor to form a Citizens' Protect
ive league at the time and ways and
mr-ans to head off the increase In price
will be determined upon. Well known
Topekans will be invited to lay their
solutions before, the public at the,
meeting.
"The Industrial council favors the
means used in a similar situation In
Joplin, Mo.." Frank Brown said to
day. "There, as a result of a mass
meeting, every citizen paid ul the rate
stipulated by the original charter there
and refused to pay more The gas
company came down from its high
price perch.
"I believe similar means would be
effective here. If not let people have
the gas taken out of their homes. The
utilities commission says it will be
only a few years anywp.y unril we
have to accustom ourselves to doing
without natural gas."
The Industrial Council will meet to
morrow night to fix definitely the
plans for the meeting.
No Hardship, Says Kelley.
"Thirty-five cent gas is not going
to work a hardship on the public if
they get the gas. I don't think the
public is going to complain about it.
Thu dollnr minimum, of course, is a
different thing. It is too high and
works a hardship on the small con
sumer. When a public utility uses a
meter system in furnishing gas I be
lieve the public should pay for just
what it gets and no more."
That was the way J. Will Kelley
secretary of the Commercial club,
summed up the gas situation today
Mr Kelley said the Commercial
club has not yet taken action on the
rras controversy. Several months -go
the hoard of directors, Mr. Kelley
pointed out. went on record in urging
the public utilities commission to in
crease the price of gas so the Kansas
Natural would be able to furnish
plenty of it.
The board of directors may take
some action on the matter in their
next meeting. Mr. Kelley said They
probably will condemn the dollar min
imum, ready to serve charge
Business men on Kansas avenue
have expressed themselves in favor of
35-cent gas. providing of course the
Kansas Natural will furnish the gas
which the merchants believe will be
done as the raise is sufficient, it is
said, to allow expenditures necessary
for increased distribution.
The dollar minimum charge is voted
too hiKh by the majority because of
the small consumer. A 35-cent rate
and a BO-cent minimum, it is pointed
out, would not be too high.
Guard Melancholy Slayer.
El Paso, Texas, Aug. 10. Harry
Spannells increasing moodiness and
melancholy has resulted in a special
guard, day and night being place.,
over him in the county Jail here to
day. The former Alpine Texas hotel
keeper still refuses to discuss his mo
tive for killing his wife and Lieut.
Colonel Butler. Spannell seldom
speaks to his guards.

Dyer's plurality. . .' 1,092
Fred W. Knapp's temporary lead
for the Republican nomination for
state auditor today went glimmering.
Late returns give Dan B. Dyer a plu
rality of 1,092 and a lead that Knapp
can hardly overcome In the counties
which have not yet sent their report
to the secretary of state.
Revised figures from the county
clerks have entirely upset all former
dope sheets. Knapp, who for a few
hours Wednesday held a lead of ten
votes over Dyer, this afternoon swung
back into second place. Only a most
unusual disturbance of the corrected
primary returns can now put him in
the running. Dyer, it seems, has won
the nomination by a plurality of from
1,000 to 1,200.
Returns today are from eighty-two
counties from which J. T. Botkin, sec
retary of state, has received official
reports. Returns reported to the State
Journal by county clerks from absert
counties are used in making up the
state total. The 'revised figures seem
to give Dyer the nomination. A num
ber of the larger counties including
Wyandotte, Shawnee, Sedgwick, Reno,
Crawford, Cherokee and Leavenworth
have not sent their reports to li e
secretary of state. Official returns

ties have been received in Topeka,

Kansas City, Aug. 10. Lee Judy,
assistant city counselor of Kansas City,
Kan., today advised gas consumers of
that city not to pay the increased gas
rate if it was put into effect there. In
a statement today he suggested that
the consumers pay the 28 cents fixed
by the Kansas utility commission and
await court proceedings before paying
the additional 10 cents.
Mr. Judy and L. H. Chapman,
commissioner of water and light, an

London. Aug. 10. New and strik

great triple offensive were reported In
official dispatches from the war of

the allied capitals announced gains In
the last twenty-four hours.
Pushing rapidly eastward on the
Isonzo front, the Italians have oc
cupied the Austrian position of Bos
chini and have captured more ground
from the retreating garrison from
Goritz.
The Russian troops have captured
the railway station of Chryplin, only
three miles east of the important city
of Stanlslau and the right bank of the
Bistrltza river. At the same time.
Petrograd reports, th Slavs have re
sumed their advance in the extreme
southeast, where they have been held
up by reinforced Austro-Germans. .
On the Somme front both the
British and French war offices re
ported slight gains. These statements,
however, were contradicted by the
German war office, which claimed the
repulse of allied attacks on the Somme
front.
Germans Repulse Enemy.
Berlin. Aug. 10. Repulse of both

Rome, Aug. 10. The Austrian
aviator station of Alsovizza, six miles
east of Goritz (Gorizia), has been cap
tured by Italian troops who are con
tinuing pursuit of the Austrian force
that retreated from Gorits, according
to reports received here today.
Cavalry detachments and Bersag
lieri cyclists detachments entered
Aisovizza after putting to flight the
Austrian rear guard which attempted
to escape.
Pursuit of the Austrian army has
been hampered by the necessity of re
pairing damaged bridges and road
ways destroyed by the enemy before
the retreat from Goritz. Infantry de
tachments, however, are In close con
tact with the Austrian right wing,
striking unceasing blows, attempting
to cut off and surround bodies of Aus
trian troops moving southward toward
the Carso plateau.
Large numbers of heavy guns, some
of which the enemy had made In
effectual attempts to destroy, fell Into
the hands of General Cadorna's forces
at Goritz.

King Victor Emmanuel is under

Kansas Bankers Start Fight on
Abilenian's Parole.
President Raines Serves For
mal Protest on Capper. .
Kansas bankers today started a
fight on the parole recommendation
for John A. Flack, the defaulting Abi
lene banker. J. L. Raines, president
of the Kansas State Bankers' associa
tion, today went before Governor Cap
per with a formal protest against the
parole.
Flack is serving a sentence hi the
state penitentniary at Lansing fir the
embezzlement $200 from ' the
ftwwlM ofrthe Abilefre states afifc.'-He
cently an application was made for. a
parole. Last week the state board of
corrections approved the application
and sent notices to Governor Capper.
It is now up to the state executive to
grant or withhold clemency
It is probable that action will re
taken in the Flack matter in a few
days. Because of this situation, Presi
dent Rainos of the State Bankers' as
sociation protested against the parole.
He appeared on behalf of the State
Bankers' association. He declared the
bankers of the state did not approve
the plan to release Flack and wanted
the banker to serve the remainder of
his sentence.
Flack has been in prison less than
three years. He holds a clerical posi
tion in the prison and has made a
good record. When his case recently
came before the board of corrections,
it promptly approved the application.
It Is necessary, however, for the gov
ernor to act in the matter. Governor
Capper stated today that a formal
hearing might be held at an early
date. At that time the protest of the
State Bankers' association will be
made formal.

Plenty Wheat for Heme Con
sumption Says Expert.
With Left Oyer, Has 150,000,
000 Bn. for Export.
Washington, Aug. 10. This year's
wheat crop will be sufficient for the
needs of home consumption and there
will be enough left to meet normal
export requirements. '
That Is the view the government of
ficials, who said today the - sensa
tional rise in wheat prices and a cor
responding increase in the price of
flour following the government's last
report, indicating a crop about two
thirds the size of last year's, was the
result of the market adjusting itself
from a crop of abnormal proportions
to one of much smaller size.
Experts of the department of agri
culture, calculating 620.000.000 bush
els of wheat will be required for home
consumption this year. A crop of
654,000,000 bushels, as forecasted
from August 1 conditions, would leave
34,000,000 bushels of this year's crop
available for export. In addition,
however .there was a pretty large carry-over
of old wheat from last year's
crop, amounting to approximately
160,000.000 bushels, or about 75,000,
000 bushels more than the average
carry-over of the preceding five years.
With the carry-over of old wheat
and the surplus of this year's esti
mated crop, officials believe the Unit
ed States will have at least 150,000,000
bushels available for export purposes.
High prices of flour usually tend to
greater economy in households, which
would result in reducing home con
sumption and leave a greater quan
tity of wheat for sending abroad.

Federal Arbitration.
LITTLE HEADWAY APPARENT
Mediation Board Today listens
to Employes Side.
If Strike Peace Fails, May Take
It to President.
New York, Aug. 10. "We're stand
ing firm," was the word brought from
the conference with the federal board
of mediation and conciliation on be
half of the 400,000 trainmen of the
country by A. B. Garretson, head of
the conductors brotherhood.
Following sessions during which the
government mediators met first with
the representatives of the railway
managers and then with the brother
hood heads, it was learned Jthat the
trainmen have not given an inch in
their demands for an eight-hour day.
Garretson declared they would con
tinue to stand their ground thruout
the conference. It was evident hat
armed as the representatives of the
trainmen are to call a strike they
have no intention of yielding to sug
gestions of arbitration. Garretson de
clared they would insist upon the
granting of their demands in full.
The federal mediators met flnt with
representatives of the employers for
a brief session today and then with
the brotherhood leaders. Judge
Chamberlain said the board expected
to hold another meeting with the rail
way managers this afternoon after
which they will confer with the rep
resentatives of the employes . again.
All meetings were executive and no
statements were made at their con
clusion. Chamberlain said he had not
communicated with President Wilson
as to the situation.
William L. Chambers, one of the
mediators, said afterward that the
railroad managers told the mediation
board how far they were prepares to
go in order to avoid a strike. . The
mediators made their side of the argu
ment plain, Mr. Chambers said that
the--mediators , would have a much
better idea of the situation after talk
ing with the employes'- committee to
day. ;'
May Appeal to president.
It was predicted today, that 't the
hoard should he unable to compromise
the differences. President Wilson
would ask representatives of the con
tending factions to meet him in Wash
ington and that he would ask them to
arbitrate their differences.-
Following the conference today the
mediators planned to draft an agree
ment which will be submitted to both
sides. If the proposed terms of set
tlement are rejected, additional meet
ings with representatives of both sides
will be held. There will be no joint
meeting of the mediators and repre
sentatives of both the employers and
the employes until some tentative me
diation agreement has been approved
by both sides.

Charleston, W. Va.. Auk. 10. Scores
of persons, reported missing early to-
day as the result of the cloudburst
that swept the Cabin Creek, paint
Creek and Coal Creek districts, .vera
accounted for in later dispatches,

Many of those first reported missinir
have been found at the homes of rcla
ttvtj or friends, whence they fled at
the first rush of waters.
Stream Carries Houses.
The Kanawha river was receding thii
morning but was still several feet high,
running swiftly and carrying down on
its crest houses, barns, chicken coops,
pianos and hundreds of pieces of fur
niture. One house that swept along
on its current carried on top the body
of a boy. Boatmen went out and re
covered it. The number of homes
carried from their foundations was not
definitely known early today. But
there were hundreds of them. At least
16,000 people were camped through
the night shelterless or with poor cov
er on the drenched ground back of
their former homes.
At least eight villages and mining
settlements in the district were either
wholly or partly destroyed while many
others felt some effects of the ,torm.
Those practically destroyed or badly
damaged were Acme, Konaa, urj
Branch, Miami, Sharon, Dawes, Kay
ford and Eskdale. Between Acme and
Kayford sixty persons are reported to
have been drowned.
8cores of Bodies on Raft.
Galllpolis, O., Aug. 10. Many
bodies of victims of yesterday's flood
were seen today in huge masses of
wreckage floating down the Ohio '
river here.
Ineffectual efforts were made 'to
........ v. .t '
of debris at Damno, south of here.
There were about a score of dead yis-,
ible rt was said at the lock.' '-'
Late estimates Indicate that the roll
of dead may reach fifty and it is the
belief that others may be dead In the
Paint Creek and Coal River valleys.
Fourteen bodies have been recovered
from the debris between the mouth of
Cabin Creek and Lee Wood, ten miles
up. All except one are those of wom
en and children. William J. McMride
made his way down the creek from
Honda to the Junction today and later
Charleston.
"Everything has gone and Investiga
tion can only reveal how many are
dead. The little towns near the mouth
of the creek have been swept clean;
Everywhere It is a mass of debris.
Houses, trees, mine tipples, railroad
cars and telephone poles are thrown
together in a heap, miles long, and
there are dead beneath. Men and
women who were seen clinging peril
ously tOj houses borne down the
to pass that point and we fear they
are now a part of the mass of wreck
age lodged against the railroad bridge
there," he said.
A million feet of lumber Is piled
mountain high at that point and It
will take days to pull it down.
The loss to the coal companies oper
ating the Cabin Creek coal fields will
reach 12.000,000. Five members of
the family of John Likens, who "ved
at Giles, were drowned. The bodleo
of the wife and mother and three
children lie In a morgue at the mouth
of Cabin creek. . '
National Guards to Hesrne.
'Huntington. W. Va., Aug. 10. Gov.
ernor Hatfield ordered two mors com
panies of the Second regiment into
the West Virginia flood district today
when reports of terrible loss of life
and suffering apparently confirmed
early estimates.
More than thirty bodies have been
recovered and on Cabin Creek tha
death list Is placed at more than 100.
Amon" the bodies tal.en from the
swirling waters were twenty-three re
covered at Cabin Creek town. Others
were being taken every little whiltf
from the creek pbove that town.
Town Washed Away.
Huntington, W. Va-, Aug. 10. A re
port reached here this morning to the
effect that Jarrolds Valley, a town of
600 inhabitants in Boone county, at
the head of Coal river, was washed
away in yesterday's cloud burst and
that 75 of its populace had lost their
lives.
That section of Jarrolds valley bi
tween Fields and Joes creeks was
swept clean by the waters, according
to reports here. It is said that at
least 500 houses were washed away.
Inhabitants had no warning of the
approach of the water and It is be
lieved the loss of life may be even
greater than that on Paint and Cabin
creeks. More than 2,000 residents are
perched on the hill tops the majority
of them without sufficient clothing
and all Df them in danger of starva
tion. Kstlmate One Hundred Dead.
Charleston, W. Va., Aug. 10. ft."

Potomas Telephone company, reached
Cabin Creek Junction shortly before
noon after a walg of over II miles'
of the company's lines between Miami
and De Sota. 'He declared that forty
persons have been drowned and half
that number of bodies recovered. Jaco
was unable to get up the Kayford
branch of the Chesapeake A Ohio rail
road., but expressed the belief thatr
damage and loss of life in that dis
trict was greater thrfn In other sec
tions. - - -
Soon after 11 o'clock the soldiers
reached Ronda, where headquarter!
were established. At that hour an es
timate of the dead remained at 100.
