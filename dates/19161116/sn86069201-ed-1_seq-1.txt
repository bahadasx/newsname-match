DEMOCRACY AND TAMMANY
In 1912 William J. llrvan drove Tam
many Hall out of the Ilaltimoie con
vention, and without tho supiwrt of
New York State, nominated a candi
date who was neither obligated nor
subservient to its malign inlluence, says
the Elizabethtown News.
In 1916 Woodrow Wilson has been
re-elected president of the United
States without the vote of New York
state, and in face of the treachery of
Tammany Hall.
They have been put out of the Dem
ocratic party like Christ drove the
Money-changer from the Temple, and
all honor to. William J. Bryan and
Woodrow Wilson who do not want a
Presidential bargain made on Wall
Street a terms.

tlmony showed clearly that it was an
unavoidable accident. Turpin was re
leased.

The National W. C. T. U. Convention
meets In Indianapolis Friday the 17th
In 1879 when Indianapolis was "Hostess
State" of the National Convention,
Frances K. Willard was elected I'reai
dent. The Christian people of all do
nominations are rejoicing over the
spiritual mikI moral uplift the city will
receive from this great gathering of
christian women.
WATCH OUT.
The way of the transgressor will be
hard if they are found hunting on any
of the farms which are posted. These
public spirited men are determined to
protect the pheasants and the few re
maining quail in this section. The
places and names of owners of posted
land ara found in tnis paper each week
and there is no excuse for anyone nut
knowing.
KENTUCKY MAGAZINE.
The first issue of the Kentucky
Magazine, the publication which is to
present what is best in Kentucky made
its appearance last wetk. The maga
zine, which bears the imprint of Lex
ington and Louisville, treats of the re
sources, institutions, material, moral
and educational progress, the character
and achievements of Kentucky men
and women, and the great possibilities
of the state's future development. The
complimentary copy sent this office
showed the magazine to be a work of
art from every standpoint.
NIMRODS SCARCE.
Owing possibly to the fact that so
many of the farms in Garrard county
are Misted, in order to preserve the
pheasants that are being propagated
so successfully, that only sixty hunters
license have been issued liy County
Clerk Hamilton during the year.
More than twice this many were is
sued last yaar and about the same num
ber the year before. Hunters are
warned not to hunt on any of the farms
posted, the names and owners of which
can be seen in every issue of the Record
O'HEARN.
Mrs Thomas O'Hearn died at her
home on the Lexington road at an
early hour Tuesday mornjng.
Her death was very sudden, dying
of rheumatism of the heart before a
doctor could reach her. She was a
lovely christian woman and had reared
a splendid family. Beside her husband
she is survived by ten living children,
four girls and six boys who have the
tenderest sympathy of the community.
Funeral services were held at the home
this morning by Rev. II. Schulte, of
Richmond, after which interment took
place in the Lancaster cemetery.
GEESE AND MORE GEESE
One of the largest droves of geese
seen in this section for several years,
passed thru the public square last Tues
day mondng, being driven from the
farm of Walton Moss, where they had
been fattened for the poultry dealers,
tlailey and Moss. There were 1804
geese in the drove and it was a curiosity
not often seen anywhere and of course
attracted much attention.
They were sold to Richmond parties
and were driven through the country, a
distance of twenty-five miles, where
thev will be slaughtered for the eastern
markets.
BEETS THAT BEAT
THE BEATER.
Mrs. Will Palmer brought to this

LOUD LUMBERING AND
HEAVY CANNONADING.
Lancaster and Garrard county Demo
crats had a big celebration last Friday
night that started about seven o'clock
and continued until well up in the night.
The public square was crowded with
enthusiastic men, women and children.
Roman candles and balloons played
quite a part and the heavy firing of the
anvils could be heard for ten miles. It
was certainly a noisy bunch, especially
the boys, numbering several hundred
that marched through every street,
with their Kan, Rah' that showed that
they were well equipped with good
cheer leader.

JUDGE F. P. FRISBIE.
In our enthu.iH.in and -liitii-n over
the re election of President Wilson, we
failed to mention in our last issue, the
election of Judge F. P Frisbie as Police
Judge for the city of Lancaster, for
the term ending December 31st 1917.
Judge Frisbie was appointed by Gov
ernor Stanley Inst spring to succeed
Judge Prather who had resigned. lie
is making a splendid lecotd on the
bench and is putting the screws to
every violator of the law, the boot-leg
ger in particular. The fact that hi
had no opposition either in the primary
or the final election, is evidence con'
elusive of his popularity and his com
petrncy to fill this important judgeship.
