By United Press.
f.:- Washington, Nov. 1G. It is
learned that the administration is
roady to start an aggressive right to
uphold the Adamson law. If the rail
roads tie up the enforcement of the
law through court action, the brother-
hoods are expected to strike.
It ia thought by some of the presi
dent's advicera that it may be possi
ble to enjoin the railroads from inter
ference with interstate traffic. It is
likely that the government will file
a demurrer to the plea of the rail
roads for an injunction, in order to
get tlie matter more quickly before
the supreme court.

DECISION
OF COURT
FOR COUNTY
Private Auditing Company Loses Conten
tion on Appeal Contract with
Commissioners Held Void
By a decision of the state supreme
court, handed down this week, the
contract entered into by the former
board of county commissioners of
Grady county with the News-Dispatch
Printing and Auditing company of
Shawnee whereby the latter, was em
ployed to audit the county books is
declared to be void.
The contract was entered into In
December, 1914, and the board of
coiiimlsRioneVs taking office the next
month were advised by County Attor
ney Venaijlo to refuse payment of the
bill. After the bill was disallowed
tho auditing company brought jauit,
losing in tho lower court and later ap
pealing. The amount Involved In the
suit was about $500. Mr. Venable and
his assistant, Allen K. Swan, repre
sented the county throughout the pro
ceedings. The substance of the court's opin
ion is contaiued in the syllabus as fol
lows :
"Where the statutes have created
two administrative offices, with co
ordinating powers and duties, in the
absence of express authority to do bo,
there is no implied authority in one
office to contract with private indi
viduals to perform service which it is
the express statutory dui"" c". tl:2 v-t--er
office to perform. The statute
which created the office of state ex
aminer and inspector and Imposed up
on that office the duty to examine the
books and accounts of all or any offi
cers or custodians of the various
funds of the county, etc., was intended
for the benefit of the counties of the
state. It Is the duty of the state ex
aminer and inspector to conduct such
county audit upou request; the coun
ty commissioners have no implied au
thority to employ a private individual
to conduct such audit; and a contract
such purpose is 'ultra vires' and void.'
ADMITTED TO PRACTICE
IN FEDERAL COURT
Allen K. Swan, assistant county at
torney, has been admitted to practice
before the United States district court
at its present term now in session, he
having passed Hie examination before

Prosecuting Attorney and Banker of Hugo
Found Guilty and Representa
tive Now on Trial
WARREN-B0MF0RD
JURY OUT 16 HOURS
Sentence of Court Reserved for Future
Date at Muskogee and Both
Released on Bond
Seldom have two sensations of
equal magnitude followed one on the
heels of the othor during- a session of
the federal court in Chickasha as is
the case todays Scarcely hud the
caso of Tom Hunter, widely known
politician of Hugo and representative
In the state legislature from that dis
trict, gono to trial this morning when
the Jury in tho caso of Robert K.
Warren, prosecuting attorney, and
Wright Bomhord, local copltulist of
Hugo, announced that a verdict had
been reached sixteen hours after the
case had been turned over to it. In
terest was Intense in the court room
while the Jury filed in and tho judge
prepared to hear their verdict. Both
men had been found guiltv after one
nf tho hardest fought liquor cases
ever tried here. The court declared
it would pass sentence on the two
men at Muskogee at a date to be an
nounced later and released both on
their original bonds.
k coincidence worthy of mention
was found in tho fact that Hunter,
w'jjsp trial had been interrupted by
i the verdict, had, at the last election,
been defeated by Warren, whose con
vection was announced, as represen
tative from that district. Both the
ingo ng and outgoing legislators for
Choctaw county at the same moment
faced the court on identical criminal
charges.
N The Warren Caso.
Outside of Chickasha Hugo Is by
far the best represented city in Ok
lahoma at this session of the court
and the citizens of that place who are
now here are representative. Of the
twelve men who took the stand yes
terday In tho Warren-Bomford trial,
eight were character witnesses and
Included lawyers, a Methodist minis
ter, and business men, while officials
took care of tho government's case.
Both Warren and Bomford are high
ly respected citizens of Hugo. In an
unguarded moment, however, in the
latter's car they vlsltod the ' Texas
town of Arthur City, ton miles dis
tant and just across the Red river,
"the dividing line at that place between
the Lone Star state and Oklahoma.
Arthur City is a city of 'steen inhab
itants more or loss when they are all
at home and its chief source of rev
enue is a saloon. In another unguard
ed moment these two highly respected
citizens in some manner accumulated
tbe 262 bottles of beer which were
seized in their car by William R.Hous-t
ton, the vigilant special enforcement
officer of the Indian service, who saw
the men cross the state line and thus
established the fact, in the opinion of
the jury, that the had introduced this
liquor Into the state of Oklahoma in
violation of tho federal statutes.
The defendants not only tried to
convince the jury that the state had
failed to make out a case against
them but by introducing eight witnes
es apparently convinced the twelve
men that their characters and general
reputation in their community were
exceedingly good.
Tom Hunter's Case.
Tom Hunter, who as a in ember of
the last legislature made a strong
fight for the speakership of that body
during the past session, was placed
on trial this morning before Judge
Campbell after making frequent at
tempts to delay that ordeal.
Hunter and an Indian, Eli Bohan
non, who had worked for the legisla
tor, are being tried jointly.

MOST OF PURE BRED
HERD STAYS IN GRADY
Local Fanners Realize That Hogs Which
Bring $100 Cost No More to Feed
Than Those Selling for $25
The highly successful sale of the
registered Duroc herd belonging to
the I. W. Hehn estute at Pocasset yes
terday afternoon brought out two im
portant facts. The first of these was
thut, in the opinion of experienced
hog men from both within and with-,
out the state, Mr. Hehn had accum
ulated a herd which was purely thor
oughbred. Tho second essential fact
was mai me people or uraay county
are becoming alive to the importance
a.id advantages of raising registered
stock which I'osts no more iui- care
nor for feed than inferior breeds
which bring one fifth the price on the
open market.
The sale cf. the Duroc herd, which
was conducted by William II. Dona
hue, netted the Hehn estate over $3,
800 and while fortunately most of the
hogs will remain In this county some
were sent to Kansas and to other
parts of Oklahoma. The best herd
sow brought $200 and waa knockod
down to Charles McKoe of Lavorgno,
a prominent pure stock breeder of
that section.
Twenty herd sows brought an aver
age of $103.50, three herd boars aver
aged $fir, and unbred gilts brought an
average price of $32, most of thi stovk
being distributed among farmers of
Grady county. Several head went io
Kansas. Among the local purchasers
was Thomas II. Dwyer who will im
prove the quality of the herd on his
; inn near town.
Among the outside bidaers of note
were Charles McKee of Lavergne,
who occasionally conducts sales of his
own, J. H. Slebert of Marlon, Kansas,
who raises hogs on a large scale, M.
B. Trice of Mankato, Kansas, Black
Brothers of Wellington, Texas, A. J.
Cole of Thomas and J. H. Sullivan of
Mitngum.
All of these men spoke In the most
decided terms of the profits to be real.
Ized from raising pure bred stock.
For instance, tho sows which averag
ed $103 cost no more to raise than
would common sows bringing $23.
Mr. Siebert ..tated that all the far
mers in the vicinity of Marion,' Kan
sas, were fully alive to the possibili
ties of keeping up the strain in their
herds, thereby produdr.6 better
