"Clearing House of Infor

of the Purposes.
New York, Nov. 16.—Formation of
the National Industrial conference
board with twelve of the most im
portant Industrial organisations of the
country in its membership, as a
"clearing house of information" in
the proposed study of problems con
fronting manufacturers of the United
States was announced here today at
a meeting of the National Founders'
association, an organisation of iron
manufacturers. Frederick P. Fish,
banker of Boston, is chairman and
Magnus W. Alexander of West Lynn,
Masti., is manager of the new organ
isation.
William H. Barr of Buffalo, presi
dent of the National Founders' as
sociation, commenting on the neces
sity of the conference board summed
its significance as follows:
"The developments of the last year,
politically and industrially, empha
Blsj'i as never before the need of more
comprehensive co-operative action in
Industry."
The industrial bodies which have
joined the board are the National

Erectors' association National Asso
ciation of Cotton Manufacturers

giving work to approximately 7,000,
000 persons and representing about
$8,000,000,000 of capital.
-.'.Heretofore to a substantial ex
tent," said Mr. Alexander, "each
haa -studied only
problem directly' affecting himself,
ignoring the faet that all Industry is
inter-related and that there is a vital
need for co-operative action and unit
ed effort. The war has brought many
new problems and peace will bring
many more. These must be studied
and solved.
The conference board will be a
clearing house of Information. Its
purpose will be to analyze and pre
sent the essential elements in the sit
uation, suggest methods and inspire
united and intelligent action. Indus
try in this country must have the
sympathetic support of the public. It
must have the co-operation of the
government and it must act intelli
gently and definitely on its own ac
count."
Frank A. Vanderllp, president of the
National City bank, asserted the new
board has been called into existence
In response to public sentiment "de
manding and needing fullness and ac

vital interests."

DOW AWAY WITH
Universal Manhood Suffrage
Granted—Sex Disability
For Women Removed
The Hague, (via London), Nov. 16
—By unanimous vote parliament has
passed a resolution, providing for the
amendment of article 80 of the consti
tution so that henceforth there will be
universal manhood suffrage and no
plural votes or compulsory voting.
The sex disability of women is also
removed by the resolution. The ac
tual granting of the women, however,'
is still distant, as it depends on the
passing of an electoral bill, which at
present is unlikely.
Early in the present years Premier
Cort Vanderlinden of The Nether
lands Introduced a bill in parliament
under the provisions of which the
constitutional obstacles In the way of
woman's right to vote would be re
moved. The bill also included a pro
vision giving women the right to be
elected to office.

torneys representing the Democratic
national committee have filed in the
county court of Morgan county a pe
tition asking for a recount of the

tions it has been impossible sometimes
for weeks to get these returns. He

quiries, however, would result in fur
ther delay and that the complete re
turns from West* Virginia might not
be known before January next.

YOUNGQRL
Daughter Committed Sui
cide Says Father—Po
lice Investigate.
Pontiac, 111-, Nov. 16.—Investiga

tablish the motive for the death of
Miss Christine Diemer, in connection
with which her father, Jacob Diemer,
a wealthy retired farmer, churchman,
and former county supervisor, her
mother and her sister are being held,
continued today and attracted wide
spread attention. One or all members
of the family may be held to the
grand Jury.
It is admitted on all sides the most
baffling point about the case was the
almost complete lack of a plausible
motive for the alleged murder of the
girl, whose body was found in Vermil
lion river a week ago.
Diemer, his wife and daughter, con
tinued denials that Christine, who is
a university graduate and 33 years
old, was murderer!. They emphasized
the suicide theory.
The daughter, Magdalena, discuss
ed freely her sisters will disposing of
$2,000, declaring her sister always
was free with money.

Captain of English Ship Ar

Berlin, Nov. 16., (by wireless to the
Associated Press, via 8ayville.)—The
assertion that the German submarine
which sank the British ship Ilowan
more on which there were several
Americans fired on lifeboats contain
ing members of the crew are dismiss
ed as utterly false in the report of
the commander of the submarine,
further details of which became
known today.
In fact, it said, the men of the
Rowanmore owe their lives to pre
cautions taken by the Germans and
the skill with which their operations
were carried out. During the 20-mln
ute pursuit of the steamship, the sub
marine's shots -were aimed accurately
astern to limit danger to the crew
which was congregated at the bow.
The Rowanmore was hit ten times,
the last shell disabling the propeller.
The submarine ceased firing the re
port continues, immediately after it
observed that the Rowanmore had
decreased her speed and abandoned
the effort to escape. No shots were
fired at the men in the boats. The
master of the Rowanmore attempted
to Justify his attempt to escape the
submarine, the commander reports,
by asserting that he desired to gain
time to launch boats, but this pretext
is not accepted.
Later the Rowanmore's captain
was made prisoner for attempting to
escape and for summoning assistance
by wireless, which speedily brought
up a British destroyer. Thereupcin the
Rowanmore was sunk by a torpedo.

GREAlWASTAGE
IN MINERAL WORK
Mine Director Says Devel
opment Has Been Too
Hasty and Inefficient.
Chicago, Nov. 16.—The develop
ment of the mineral resources of the
United States was described as an
orgy of hasty exploration by Van H.
Manning, director of the bureau of
mines, addressing the American min
ing congress.
"Great as has been the advance in
the mining industry," he said, "it is
deplorable to have to say that it has
been carried on in a most wasteful
manner and with little regard for the
safety of the men who labor in the
mines.
"Had our 'mineral resources been
developed they would have lasted
many years longer and yielded ten
times as much wealth.
"The chief heed of the United
States If It would meet new conditions
of trade Is a deeper and wider co
operation among our industries and
the elimination of factionalism and
sentlmentallsm."
Dr. George Otis Smith, director of
the geological survey, declared that
any regulation of prices needed to be
under federal control. "The private
owner of coal land has no more sacred
right to say whether or not coal shall
be mined or tp fix an exorbitant price
on this Indispensable resource than
the coal operators have to combine
to exact an excessive profit from the
oonsumer or the railroads to charge
all the trattc will bear." ,•

Fargo, N. D„ Nov. 16.—Bismarck
this morning was chosen as the next
convention city of the North Dakota
Kducation association. The associa
tion adopted resolutions affecting ed
ucation all over the state and setting
itself on record as favoring some very
far reaching reforms in the adminis
tration of rural school systems, and
in the selection of superintendents for
the state and the county.
Consolidated Schools Approved.
The committee on resolutions re
ported out some resolutions that go
to the very heart of the education
problems of the state, and are said to
tend to revise the whole system of
school administration. The first res
olution adopted pledged the teachers
of this state to approval of the move
ment for consolidated schools and
was freely said to be one of the most
far reaching resolutions adopted at
this session. In connection with this
resolution, the session agreed that
they would work for teachers' homes
to be established at consolidated
school centers. On account of the
fact that teachers who work in rural
districts must have a special prepara
tion a resolution was adopted favor
ing the establishment of a special,
course for this purpose that teachers
in these districts may become more
efficient.
Administrative Reform.
Attacking the very core of school
administration in the state and coun
ty, the association resolved to favor
the creation of state and county
boards of education, these boards to
appoint a state superintendent of pub
lic instruction and the county board
to appoint the county superintendent,
both appointments to be made with
out respect to residence. They also
favored the creation of a special bu
reau of education and investigation
under the direction of the state board
of regents to-be headed by a trained
statistician of education.
Believing that the terms of rural
schools are not now properly adapted
to the conditions of this agricultural
state, the association went on record
as favoring a later date for the open
ing of rural schools and the increase
of the minimum length of time
schools should be in session.
The last resolution introduced ap
proved the teacher's retirement fund.
K. J. Taylor, superintendent of pub
lic instruction, in his final address be
fore the association, urged upon the
teachers their hearty support of the
incoming state administration, main
taining that every patriotic North Da
kotan owed allegiance to his state
government first.
