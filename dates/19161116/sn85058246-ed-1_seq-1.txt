Dr. E. C. Titus of tho Utah Agri
cultural Collego has resigned his po
sition with that institution to accept
a position with tho U. S. Bureau of
Plant Industry as Technologist In
Sugar beet seed production. Dr.
Titus Is temporarily looking after
his work at tho local Institution, and
is also actively engaged In his work
with tho government. Ho leaves to
day for California and will bo gone
about three weeks "on work for tho
U. S. Bureau.
Tho purpose of this appointment Is
to give tho government a better op
portunity to study tho sugar beet
seed industry and to determine tho
best strains of seed for commercial
planting.
For the past ten years the col
lego experiment station, under the
direction of Dr. Titus has been grow
ing sugar beet seed in small quan
tities with good success. However,
there has been but little attempt to
grow tho seed In commercial quan
tities In Utah. In Idaho, however,
thero is a beot seed concern that is
highly successful in producing seed.
It 1b not doflnltely decided yet that
a station will bo authorized in this
Btato but it it is, it w'lll In all prob
ability bo in connection, with tho ex
periment station. In any event, Dr.
Titus will bo locatod at Logan until
