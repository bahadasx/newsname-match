REVIEW DOLL AND TOY FUND
Movement on Foot to Make Christmas 1916 a Memor
* able Date for Morgan City Needy
Are the little poor folks of Mor
gan City to sigh in vain this Christ
mas for those things so dear to the
hearts of children? Is the great pre
cedent established by the big-heart
ed, generous citizens last Christmas,
as a community, not to be repeated
on a bigger and better and broader
.scale than ever before?
Dont worry, little ones. There is
awake in your midst a spirit
tlmt proclaims for you a merry,
merry Christmas. Your little world's
will be full to the bursting of joy on
the Yuletide Anniversary.
Already there lays in the treasury
a nice sum left over from last year's
Christmas fund, and The Review
[and the King's Daughters and hun
jdreds of big-soul men and women
who know the pleasure of work in
a good cause have stated their will
ingness to carry out the plans in
[view which will insure those joy
hungry tots a lull measure on the
dawn of December 25th, 1916.
In order to present this opportu
nity of contributing to the greatest
number, The Review tenders its ser
vices in the raising of a Doll and
Toy Fund. This great work will
have all the publicity that the Re
view can possibly give to it and, no
doubt, it will be only necessary to
call it to the attention of its readers
in order to meet with a hearty and
generous fund.
All funds turned over to the Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
v _ j l .v , j- . ,
bursed by the ladies of the King's
r, rm.- i j-j . I
Daughters. This splendid organiza
.. . , ., 6 .
tion has again offered its services i
in this work and the entire com
munity is assured that the work will i
have the best of attention. j
The three banks of this city have
assigned their ^willingness to receive !
the contributions of the public and j

General Villa was reported to

COSTLY COSTUMES IN
"ROMEO AND JULIET'
"Never has a "Juliet" been dress
ed as magnificently as Miss Bayne is
dressed in the screen production of
"Romeo and Juliet" The statement
comes from venerable Leonard Gro
ver, in whose theatres Adelaide
Neilson, Mary Anderson and other
great Juliets have played. He asserts
that no actress who has ever essayed j
the part has been arrayed in the re-1
gal splendor that envelops Miss Bay- -
ne in the eight-reel motion picture j
production of Shakespeare's great:
drama. The costumes of Francis X. |
Bushman as "Romeo" are equally
rich, and those of the remainder of |
the cast are in keeping with them, j
Romeo first sees Juliet in a ball
taber overdress of white chiffon, ;
heavily bugled with silver and fes- j
tooned with silver crystal strands.
The gown has a head-dress of j
pearls. For her visit to Friar Laur-,
ence's cell Juliet wears a cloak of j
folds on folds of navy blue tissue ■
heavily brocaded with gold flowers.!
the design reaching up to the fluted
hood and down to the tjp of the j
sweeping train. She is borne to the [
tomb in a shimmery gown of silver
tissue, its hand- embroidered flowers
outlined in silver thread, the taber
festooned with pearls. On her head
a simple wreath of silver hand
the funds will be assembled daily
from all sources and deposited in the
People's State and Saving Bank. No
doubt, other business men and con
rcerns in the city will be glad to as
sist in the work by accepting contri
pa
butions from their friends and
j trons.
| Each day the Review will publish
j the names of all who make contri
butions and the amount contribu
ted. • Every man, woman and child
ig invited to share in this great
j movement and the contribution of
-the citizen who feels that his circum
stances will permit him to give but
little will be just as gladly accepted
and just as highly appreciated as the
large contributions which men of
means no doubt will gladly give.
Last year at Christmas time, the
City Hall of Morgan City, which was
the place of distribution of the toys
collected, was the scene of great
happiness. Every man, woman and
child who witnessed the joy which
they were instrumental in affording
to those little folks must feel that
there is a vital necessity for the oc
casion to be again lived thru. With
a greater prosperity evident this
year, let's do more toward this event
than was done last year when the
handsome fund donated amounted
to upward of $100.
To start the Doll and Toy Fund
contributions for 1916, the King's
Daughters are heading the list with
-the magmficient donation of $30.00.
