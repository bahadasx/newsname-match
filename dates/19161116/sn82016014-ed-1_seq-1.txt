Attorney Says Half Million Has
Been Spent in Betterments.
CAN SUPPLY J20MIUI0H FEET
That Is Limit of Capacity of the
Pipe Lines.
Everybody Willing for the Do
liertys to Have It.
Officers and attorneys for the Kan
sas Natural Gas company are not op
posing the sale of the gras property to
.the Doherty interests, according to a
statement today, by Robert Stone of
Topeka, an attorney for the Kansas
Natural. Stone declared the officers,
as well as John Landon, the receiver,
and the attorneys in the case, are will
ing to co-operate in the sale and in
any move that will mean more gas.
With that, Stone checks the next
move to the public utilities commis
sion. At present, Stone declares, the Kan-
pas Natural gas contracts will shortly
provide 120 million cubic feet of gas
a day. That supply is declared to be
the maximum test for the present pipe
line system. Next year new pipes and
manv betterments will be necessary to
meet the demands. Kither in event of
a sale or continuance under the pres
ent policy, these betterments will
doubtless be made, Stone stated.
With the present shortage of gas.
Stone urges wealthy consumers to
abandon the use of gas in their fur
naces. In this manner, he says, an
adequate supply will be available for
the poor people and small consumers.
Stone emphatically denied reports
that opposition has developed, to the
sale of the Kansas Natural to the
Uohertys. If the public utilities com
mission will merely live up to advance
advertising, the deal will be made, he
said.
Promises More Gas.
Discussing the sale today. Stone
.said: . .
"i he story uus been circulated --t
some opposition has developed against
the purchase of the Kansas Natural
by the Doherty interests. It is only
fair to say that if there is any oppo
sition it does not come from Mr. Lon
don's ide of the prerent litigation.
Mr. Hays, r lent of the Kansas
Natural and auditor for the recp' ";
Juui: Flannelly, Mr. Landon, the re
ceiver, and each of his attorneys are
very much in favor of the sale of the
Loherty interests b?cause they hope
this will mean a better supply of gas
to the consumers and they want the
litigation ended as soon as possible.
It may not mean a larger supply this
winter than Mr. Landon would be
able to give, because during the sum
mer he has done everything in his
power to procure an adequate surply.
Spent Half a Million.
"He has spent nearly a half million
of dollars in drilling new wells, pro
curing gas rights and the extension of
mains for that purpose. He has un
der contract and production over 120.
000,090 cubic feet of gas per day, all
of which will be accessible within the
next two or three weeks and this is as
much as in. .-..stem will ,
its present condition. By another
year more pumping stations or ail-,
tional pipe lines in the northern part
of ihe field must be added to give bet
ter service. This is what Mr. Landon
hum planned to do and if the property
is sold to the Do In i . s, we have every
reason to believe that similar or bet
ter frovif ion will be made by them.
"Every assistance possible on his
part and their part is being rendered
by the receiver and his attorneys to
perfect the sale to ;he Dohertys and,
as we understand, it now hinges upon
the granting of permission by the
public utilities commission. We are
glad to notice by the press reports
that such permission will be granted.
In the meantime if men of wealth
who consume large quantities of gas
In their furnaces would install some
other fuel for this winter, the poor
people who use small quantities would
be very much better accommodated."

OUT FORJLACES
Candidates for County Offices
Are Most Active.
Officers Have Not Made Known
Their Appointees.
Not a single county officer elected
November 7 has announced his ap
pointments and the milling continues.
Candidates for appointment are not
bothering the new officers personally
but their friends are busy.
Robert ; Garver, county attorney-
elect, has a first and a second assist
ant to appoint. Hugh Fisher, Ed
Rooney and Tinkham Veale are all
being talked of for first place. Fish
er's friends and Rooney's friends are
particularly active. For second place
Jay Jenson and J. Frank Chaney, son
of John Chaney, chairman of the Re
publican county central committee,
are the candidates.
Hugh Larimer, sheriff-elect, has an
undersheriff and two deputies and a
jailer to appoint. Soon after election
Robert Miler, Robert Tasker and
Charles Lytle were mentioned. A pe
tition is being circulated asking Frank
Leech, elected marshal of the court of
Topeka. to reappoint Lytle as deputy
marshal. Apparently Lytle is out of
the running so far as th sheriff's of
fice is concerned. Tasker's friends
have eased down and it looks like
"Bob" Miler for undersheriff. The
dope has it that "Joe" Holman may
stay as deputy sheriff. Holman Is a
negro who taught school in the south
before he came to Topeka, who -is
always on the job at the sheriff's of
fice and who has several good cap
tures to his credit.
An Office Filled by Women
Mrs. Mary Chapin will be the new
clerk of the court. There are three
clerkships in that office, all of them
now held by women. It is said that
perhaps one place will go to a man.
Clyde Cowgill, an attorney, and Will
Anderson, now stenographer in the
county attorney's office, have been
mentioned. Mrs. Chapin has given no
intimation as to her appointments.
It is said that the appointment as
deputy county clerk was offered by
Kenneth Raub to John Wright, who
has served as assistant under O. K.
Swayze, but that Wright has not ac
cepted it. Wright was a candidate for
the Republican nomination as county
clerk against Raub. He has been in
the office for years and is looked upon
by Swayze as a valuable man. The
friends of Harry Wright, defeated
candidate for the Republican nomin
ation for county commissioner, are
pushing him for deputy clerk. but
there is said to be trouble between
Raub and some of Wright's friends.
The two newly elected members of the
board of county commissioners. Hen
ry McAfee and A. A. Rodgers, are tak
ing an interest in the selection of a
deputy county clerk.

Von Hindenburg Sees Great
Problem Facing Germany.
MEN MUST HAVE THEIR FATS
Laborers in Ammunition Plants
in Need of Foods.
Nourishment Behind Helm of
Empire's "Home Army."
Berlin, Nov. IS. The afternoon
newspapers today print a lengthy ap
peal by Field Marshal von Hinden
burg to Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg,
the imperial chancellor, for active
propaganda among agriculturists to
induce not only a greater production
of fats but, also, a greater willingness
voluntarily to give up all available
food supplies for the benefit of indus
trial workers, particularly in ammuni
tion making centers. The appeal de
clares it does not appear to be suffi
ciently appreciated In some circles
that it is a question of life and death
for the German people and empire
and that it ' is . impossible to keep
workers on an efficient basis unless
they have a justly apportioned and
sufficient amount of fats.
Field Marshal von Hindenburg says
he is informed from the coal mine
sections and other industrial quarters
that this not only is the case but the
quantities of fats in some sections are
decidedly too low.
Don't Fu" Ar- T-iat ? Crisis.
The field marshal expresses the be
lief that the authorities in the agri
cultural district are insufficiently in
formed concerning the situation and
therefore do not appreciate that it is
their duty to increase fat production
as far as possible and voluntarily give
it over for general consumption.
Therefore he asks le chancellor "in
the most urgent manner" to use all
means to increase the nourishment of
war industry workers and to place
behind the plow and the factory of the
home army strong personalities of all
parties in order to link the peasants
with theindustrial apA city workers
and awaken in them all the furor of
Teutonicu3." . '
Count von Hindenburg concludes
with the declaration that he has the
impression that officials have become
weary in their efforts to be as just as
possible which has as its results in
decisivem He declares the chan
cellor will not fail to recognize the
danger in this and says the people
want strong and decisive officials so
that they may be strong and submit
willingly to many an uncomfortable
measure.

by government forces. The issue of
the fighting is still uncertain.
Still Worried About Americans.
In spite of the story told by the na
tive refugees that the ten Americans
known to be in Parral had left that
town before Villa's attack, fears of
the mining men are not quieted. An
other flood of messages from relatives
and friends of the ten men reported
the offices of the mining companies
following publication of the refugees
story yesterday. Altho ten days have
elapsed since the Americans have left
Parral, according to refugees, they
have not erached a channel of com

the Incident was ciosea
In preparation for' further ex-'
aminations, a new panel of twenty

Gov't Prepares to Make Fight
for Adamson Law.
May Enjoin Railroads From In

New York, Nov. 16. Prospects of
the greatest Industrial struggle in his
tory were increasing today.
The capital and labor situation aris
ing from the railroads determination
to fight the Adamson eight-hour law
was accentuated by formation of a
vast organization of employers to b.i
known as the National Industrial
Confe-enee Board. This new body.
representing 8,000.0OO,ouu capimi
and employing 7,000,000 persons pro
pose that industrial legislation snau
be watched more closely, mai legis
lators shall be guided by public in
formation and that favoritism to labor
shall be eliminated.
It will fight such measures as the
Adamson eight-hour law; and it be
lieves that the election showed there
is no labor vote, and nence legisiaiuic.
heieafter need not curry favor with
labor leaders as they claim has been
done in the past.
Th significance of the new align
ment increased with receipt of word
in Baltimore dispatches that the
brotherhoods will join to force the
eight-hour day in all industries not
by legislation, but by the force of or- :
ganized labor.
The railroads kept up their prep
arations for trying to prevent opera
tion of the Adamson law. More suits,
covering all lines' and all industries,
will be submitted to courts all over the
nation in the next ten days.
It was apparent in railroad circles
today that the managers have virtu
ally given up l:ope of coming to terms
with the brotherhood chiefs, altho
they said: "The latch string is out
for the men and their representatives.
The managers' conferences has ad
journed." Another meeting may be
called next week, however, it was said
today.
One of the leading railroad man
agers said today he knows nothing
about a reported conference with the
president.
Believe Railroads Will Fall.
Washington, Nov. 16. The admin
istration is ready to start an aggres
sive fight in behalf of the Adamson
law, now object of concerted attack by
most of the big railroads of the coun
try, it was made clear today
Belief was expressed by high offi
cials the efforts to enjoin the opera
tion of the law would fail.
If the railroads tie up the enforce
ment of the Adamson act, the railroad
workers are expected to strike. lt is
the view of some of the president's
advisors that the courts would ' hold
the railroads responsible for Interfer
ence with interstate commerce in-such t
case, and would compel them to abide
by the provisions of the act.
Law Only Temporary.
This belief is strengthened by the
admission claim that the Adamson
law primarily is a measure designed
to obtain a thoro and scientific in
vestigation of facts on which to base
final legislation. It is to be effective
only six months, during the time of
the investigation of the application of
the eight-hour day. It can be extend
ed only thirty days at the request of
the special commission appointed un
der it.
By reason of the very nature of the
! act. men are convinced efforts to
other hand it is thought it may be
possible to enjoin "interference" by
the railroads with interstate traffic, as
labor leaders were enjoined in the
famous Pullman strike of twenty years
ago.
It appeared likely the government
Yuld file, a demurrer, claiming the
Adamson law constitutional in answer
to the railroads' plea for an injunction
restraining its enforcement. This
would result in a straight-away fight
on the constitutionality of the act and
would serve more quickly to bring the
case before the supreme court.

DEAD BEFORE PUT IN RIVER
Pair of Water-Soaked Shoes
Furnishes Faint Clue.
Was School Teacher and Uni
versity Graduate.
Pontiac, 111., Nov. 16. The estab
lishment of the motive for the death
of Miss Christine Diemer in connection
with which her father, Jacob Diemer,
wealthy retired farmer, churchman
and county supervisor, her mother and
her sister are being held, occupied the
attention of the authorities here to
day. State's Attorney F. A. Ortman
continued his investigation of evidence
upon which one or all of the members
of the family may be held to the grand
jury.
It was admitted by the officers that
the baffling point about the case was
the almost complete lack of motive
for the alleged murder of the girl,
whose body was found in the Vermil
lion river a week ago. Diemer, his
wife and daughter Magdalena, con
tinued their denials that Christine had
been n;urdered and the theory of sui
cide was emphasized. A development
was a statement attributed to Magda
lena, that Christine's will, disposing
of about $2,000 in cash and personal
property, had been drawn in her favor, I
but at the same time she declared
that she had not wanted for money.
Find Suspicious Shoes.
A pair of muddy, water-soaked
shoes figured in an investigation being
made by County Treasurer W. M. Pat
terson, former sheriff. Mr. Patterson
came upon the shoes on the back
porch. Magdalena Diemer, Christine's
sister, according to Patterson, said she
was not sure, but thought that the
shoes were hers. Later she said that
she wore them in cleaning up the base
ment. The basement, Mr. Patterson
said, is of cement and neither wet nor
muddy. Local experts assert that the
absence of water from the lungs pre
cludes the theory of suicide. ,-
The Diemer home la two blocks from
the Vermillion river, and the street
leading to it Is a busy one. The cor..
ner's physician who conducted the au
topsy expressed the opinion that death
came several days before the body
was placed in the river. Magdalena
Diemer talked freely of the case
"Christine's will disposing of $2,000
in cash and personal property is in
my favor and if suspicion is directed
against any member of the family it
ought to be me," she said.
No Need for Money.
"My defense is that no member of
father's family ever had to ask for
money more than once, or ever ask
for it without getting It."
Christine taught school and had
money of her own. She had her own
automobile. She was a graduate of
the University of Chicago and 33
years old. The circumstances of notes

Heroism on Battlefield Inspires
Britons for Hardships. .
London, Nov. 16. England to
unit today of support of the govern-,
ment's food dictatorship plan. Not a
newspaper nor an individual, appa j
rently, in the whole United Kingdom j
voiced criticism of the plans an.
nounced in parliament yesterday by l
W alter Runciman, contemplating :
conservation of England's food sup. ;
ply. ' The only criticisms heard were i
that the governmental control had -.
been over long delayed and the pre :
liminary plans, as announced, were
insufficiently sweeping or drastic. -
It Is known, however, that Runci
man's announcement was purely pre
liminary and that he did not reveal all
the steps of control which the govern,
ment has determined upon. The food .
dictatorship, it waa said, may event ;
ually outdo even the thoroness of the
German system.
Eliminate Sugar, First Step.
The British people are fully pre.
pared for the sacrifices which it is
realized will be consequent upon oper
ation of the new plan. The public is
all the more willing to submit to the
hardships of a controlled food supply
in view of the thrilling stories of Brit,
ish army heroism now reaching here.
It was accepted here that the first
activities of the new dictatorship
would have to do with limitation on
the use of sugar In costly confection
ery, of indiscriminate feeding to ani
mals of vetables suitable for human
consumption and of wasteful use of
white flour and potatoes.
Retail food prices, according to
semi-official statistics available today,
show that in a year there has been an
increase cf about 27 per cent. Prices
now are about 78 per cent higher
than the year prior to the war. But
on such staples as eggs, potatoes, fish
tad sugar, the prices have nearly
doubled.
Dictator Urged in Russia, Too.
In the Russian duma. the budget
committee urged Immediate assump
tion by the government of complete
control of the food distribution and
food prices. ,
In France, the public was officially
prepared for a government decree,
ushering In rigid war economies in an
effort to compel the saving of coal,
light and provisions.
The decree to be issued by the
French government very soon will In
vest a national supervising body with.
wide powers to stay waste and ex
travagance. The order already cast
its shadows last night upon the world
of amusement and entertainment of
"gay Paris." Shops were ordered
closed at 6 In the evening and res
taurants and cafes at 9:30, an hour
earlier than heretofore. Opera, thea
ters and music halls are to close one
day In the week. Elevators of many
buildings will be stopped to conserve
coal for lighting. There begas today;
a sudden hoarding of candles and oil.
Four Meatless Days a Week.
In the duma session, the great suf.
fering existing among the working
classes (of Russia was . frankly dis
cussed. Already there are four meat
less days and tickets are required for
all foodstuffs.
