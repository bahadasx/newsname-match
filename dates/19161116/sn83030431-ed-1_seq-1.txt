within striking distance of Cernavoda
nd Its great bridge across the Danube.
Ills troops to-night face Von Mnck.cn-
sen's main lino protecting the brldse

miles north of Cernavoda, hns hern
taken by the advancing Hussions and
Ilumanl.ins. They arc before Sclmenl,
five miles south of lioualc, on which
rtsts the left wing of the line on '
.... , ,
which on Mackensen stakes the sue- .
rrs of his Dobrudjii position.
Thus Cernavoda and the bridge are
more seriously menaced than at any time .
since the Uusslans and Humanlans re
organized and under better leadership I
Marled to retrieve their defeat. Ths I
fcmiid Itusso-Ilumanlan army, which '
iijvjnred on the bridge across thu
Danube marshes from tho west, is firmly
established Just over the river from Cer
iiavodd. Dip two armies, coming from
north and west, are almost in position
fur a concerted blow at the who'c Teuton-Uulgur-Titrklsh
position,

Tepdl. In little more llim ten dajs the
Uusslans and Ilumnnlaus, previously In
relie.it, have come back fifty mllco.
Von Mackensen's main pocltlun. which
this army now faces, is a strong one,
resting upon a series of heights extend
ing across the Oohrudji from the Dan
ube to the llrnck Sea nt a distance from
Ivc to fifteen miles north of the Com-stanza-Cernavoda
line. The Dobrudji
here is little more than thirty mile
wnie. so Von Markersen has a compara
tiel) short line to 'defend.
It U believed here that the plan of
'he I'.mente Is to bring pressure to bear
all alom; this line by the first army,
Mhde the Fecund, In the tinube marshes
and nn the Crnavoda bridge causeway,
seriously th.-eatens tho left flank and
the Huslmi Olack Sea fleet bombards

5THAV. HOMES OF PLANT AND
VANDERBILT GO TO TRADE
Fight Ended to Keep Out Business, but Architectural
Beauties Are to Be Preserved in the
Altered Buildings.
Two more of the few dwelling re
maining on Fifth avenue below the park
are to be given over to trade. Cartter,
a jeweler at 712 fifth avenue, com
pleted arrangements yesterday for tak
ing over under lease the Morton F.
Plant houee nt the southeast corner of
Fifth avenue and Fifty-second street.
At the same time It was announced that
William K. Vanderbllt had rented the
adjoining dwelling ut 647 Fifth avenue
to an art firm.
That Mr. Plant was negotiating' to get
a business concern Into his property has
been known for some time, but that Mr.
Vanderbllt has surrendered to trade an
other bulwark which ho himself erected
ngalnst the advance of business up Fifth
avenue is taken by real estate men to
mean that the days of the little Van
derbllt colony across from St. Patrick's
Cathedral are numbered.
The Jewelry rlrm which has obtained
the Plant house has taken It for a long
period of years at an extremely high
rental, and the first step toward the
consummation of the transaction will be
the alteration of the building at a cost
of $50,000. When Mr. Plant decided to
lease the property he ruled oh a con
cession to those who had been his neigh
bors for many years that the outward
appearance of the building should not
bo changed In any way.
Hut trade's demands are great, and

finally It was agreed that the ground
floor only should be altered Into a shop
front, or as Mr. Cartler says, "adjusted
to business conditions." He said he will
not spoil the splendid example of
Georgian architecture, except perhaps to
embellish It. Most of the J.1O.000 will
be spent changing the Interior, which Is
to bo representative of French art.
The Vanderbllt house Is considered one
of Fifth avenue's finest dwellings. For
taxation purposes It Is valued at $413.
000. The late William D. Hloane oc
cupied It from 1904 until his death, nnd
It was not until Aurll. 1915. when Mr.
Vanderbllt took title to It, that It be
came known he had owned It since Its
erection. It Is one of two dwellings
which Mr. Vanderbllt :md Mr. Hloane
nut ud next to the I'nlon Club, when
they were spending big sums fighting
the trade Invasion of Fifth avenue.
About the same time they bought the
Hotel J.angham site at a high price, on
Fifth avenue from Flfty-secomi to utty
third street. They tried for several
years to get people to build residences
on the block, meanwhile paying big
sums In taxes and carrying charges, but
finally they gave up the light and the
black was Improved with large com
mercial tyilldlngs.
W. W. Hoswcrth designed the con
templated alterations to the Plant house.
Mr. Plant Is erecting a new home at
Fifth avenue and Klghty-slxth street.
