Wilson, with 1,953 out of 1,978 pre­
cinct reporting, has 54,031 votes to
52,843, a lead of 1,188 for the presi­
dent, who a second time carries North
Dakota. Four years ago his plurality
over Roosevelt was 3,831, and over
Taft, 6,465, but Wilson's total in 1912
was but 29,555 votes.
Late reports on the senatorial con­
test indicate a slight gain for Burke,
altho McCumber's lead is so great that
there is no doubt as to his election.
McCumber in 1,929 precincts has 56,
203, while Burke has 40,585.
The League judiciary ticket in yes­
terday's returns materially increased
its lead over the independent slate.
The vote, with 1,750 precincts report­

CONGRESSWOMAN TO PASS
AS "HE" IN CONSTITUTION
Miss Rankin is a republican,
democratic congressmen in Washing
ten said today they do not think that
leaders of their party will try to bar
Miss Rankin because of her sex. If
her democratic opponent contests her
seat he will do so on other grounds
than that she is a woman. Senator
Charles A. Culbertson, chairman of
the senate committee on the judiciary,
said the question of Miss Rankin's
eligibility to a seat in the house is
with the members of the house.
LET ALL VOTERS CELEBRATE

The Wilson voters have cause to

have cause to rejoice. The victors of

their achievement in electing Frazier

STORY OF "STREDWICK AND THE "CORN STALK"
Earle Stredwick's Corn Averaged 75
Bushels.
Earle Stredwick of Logan grew a
field of corn this year on his farm
which averaged 75 bushels per acre.
Mr. Stredwick planted his field to
Boone county White Dent corn, secur­
ing the seed from Cairo, Mo., two
years ago. The corn was planted May
24 and some of it matured, Mr. Stred­
wick securing enough good mature
seed to plant a good sized field next
year. The corn was grown on land
that had produced alfalfa for three
years and the mature corn was picked
early in September, before there was
any frost.

STEEH KEEPS LEAD
OVER CDSEV FOR
Now Practically Assured of Election to
Treasurership on the Republican
Ticket—Small Margin
With a lead of 228 in all but 14 small
precincts, John Steen, republican, ap­
parently seems assured of the election
tolhe state treasurership. The figures
lam given out are: Steen 49,874 Casey
49J646, giving the former a plurality of
228.
Steen's lead jumped from 186 to 228
and it is not believed that the precincts
still missing will make any material
change in the result.
The contest between Steen and
Casey has been exceptionally close
and was one of the most remarkable
in the history of the state. Casey had
the endorsement of the non-partisan
league and his slogan, "Don't forget
Casey," was dinned into the ears of
voters for weeks before the election.
The candidates polled greater votes
than the senatorial and gubernatorial
candidates.
Enjoyed Skating.
Youngsters took advantage of the
cold weather the first of the week and
enjoyed skating on the river and on
the lakes in the city. The ice is nearly
four inches thick and apears to be
perfectly safe.
Elect 26 Republican Governors.
The republicans didn't fare so badly
on election day, with the exception
that they lost their candidate for pres­
ident There were 26 republican gov­
ernors elected.
The corn grew so tall that Mr.
Stredwick was reminded of the old
story of "Jack and the Bean Stalk.
Mr. Stredwick is 5 feet and 8 inches
tall and some of the corn grew to a
height of 12 feet. Some of the ears
towered 8 feet above the ground and
the owner could not pick the tallest
ears without breaking down the stalks.
This is not a fairy tale. Mr. Stred­
wick figures that the corn averaged
fully 75 bushels per acre. He has al­
ways had success growing corn.
In the picture Mr. Stredwick and
his little son are to be seen. The
grower has carefully preserved a
large shock of the corn which he will
exhibit at the Minot Mid-Winter Fair.
SEVERAL DEFEND­
ANTS PLEAD GUILTY
Hamilton Gets Six Years for Highway
Robbery—Stratton Goes Free—
Murder Trial Now On.
Halvor Olson, charged with adult­
ery, pleaded guilty at the opening of
district court Tuesday.
James Doyle pleaded guilty to car­
rying concealed weapons. He is the I
W. W. who pulled a gun during an al­
tercation at Kenmare.
Donald Sacchi, charged with assault
with intent to do great bodily harm,
pleaded guilty to assault and battery.
The complaining witness was James
Fhilamallee of Berthold. The men
got into a dispute over wages and
Cacchi attacked Philamallee with a
knife.
Ed Schefflebein, charged with as­
sault with intent to do great bodily
harm, pleaded guilty to assault and
battery. The charge Avas changed on
recommendation of the complaining
witness, Emil Ekholm, of Ryder. Ek
holm is a deputy game warden and
when he considered that Schefflebein
was hunting out of season, he attempt­
ed to take the man's gun away.
Schefflebein, it is said, threw a rock at
the game warden.
Sentences have not been passed yet.
Charles Hamilton, colored, pleaded
guilty to first degree robbery and re­
ceived a sentence of six years in the
penitentiary. Hamilton was one of the
four highwaymen, three negroes and
one white, who held up four white men
in the sand pit in the southwestern
part of the city several wedks ago.
Hamilton is said to be the negro who
fired the shot that wounded one of the
victims, Mat Lahto, of Gackle, N. D.,
in the hip. He was found a few min­
utes afterwards with a gun, one cart­
ridge missing and with some of the
money taken from the four men.
H. H. Stratton, the white man,
charged with being with Hamilton and
the other two negroes, was tried
charged with highway robbery. The
jury, after being out nearly all night,
brot in a verdict of not guilty this
morning. Stratton was defended by
Eradford & Nash. Hamilton, the negro
v*ho pleaded guilty, swore that Strat­
ton was not guilty. Golden, another
negro, testified that Stratton was with
Hamilton and the other negroes.
Mat Lahto of Gackle, N. D., Elmer
Lahto, a cousin from Brocket, N. D.,
Victor Lind and Jacob Paulakka, all
Finlanders, had been threshing in this
part of the state. They were waiting
in Minot to take No. 2 to Stanley and
started out to see the sights. They
were followed by three negroes and a
white man, who held them up.
Claude Peoples, colored, who i,s
charged with the murder of Gregg,
another negro, in Harris' joint recent­
ly. is on trial today. Gregg before he
died made a statement that Peoples
had shot him. "Golden" Brown, who
was shot by Gregg, is recovering and
he will be an important witness in the
trial if he cares to go on the stand.
The jury in the Peoples murder case
v-as selected this morning and before
dinner States Attorney Herigstad
made his statement to the jury. The
first witness was Harris, the owner of
the building where the murder occur­
red. The states attorney has any num­
ber of witnesses and it is believed that
he has a good case against the de­
fendant, who can hardly hope to es­
cape conviction.
Ed Golden, who was in the hospital,
has recovered and is now in the coun­
ty jail. He may be used by the state
or it is possible he may go on the
stand for the defense. In case that
he turns state's evidence, the jig for
Peoples will be up.
This will end the criminal calendar.
Since April, States Attorney Herig­
stad has been instrumental in getting
c'6 defendants to plead guilty, thus
saving the county from $300 to $500
which each trial would have cost. This
is good work on the part of the state's
attorney.
WILL RAISE $500 ON TAG DAY
Fifty Minot Women Will be Stationed
About the City—Money All to be
Used for Food Purpose.
Saturday, November 18, is Tag Day.
Mrs. John Campbell, president of
the United Charities, hopes to raise
$500 or more on that day. Mrs. Camp­
bell says there are many poor people
in Minot who will need food, fuel and
clothing for their children in order
that they may attend school. The
money will be used for an excellent
purpose.
Mrs. Campbell has appointed the
following committee: Mrs. D. A. Din
nie, chairman Mrs. Skrivseth, Mrs. A.
Carr, Dorr Carroll.
Fifty women of the city will be sta­
tioned at various parts of town with
tags. When they approach you, have
your change ready. They will all have
little banks. The money will be put in
the banks and at night will all be de­
posited in the name of the United
Charities.
FRAZIER DON'T SAY MUCH.
Lynn J. Frazier, governor-elect of
North Dakota, visiting in Fargo, re­
fused to say much for publication. He
refused to say anything about his ap­
pointees but admitted that he had re­
ceived thousands of letters asking for
jobs.
From the governor-elect, however,
there was elicited the prophecy that
the next legislature of North Dakota
will adhere as strictly as possible to
the program outlined before election
by the leaders, of the Non-partisan
league. The new governor says that
the things for which the farmers have
been working will be brought about,
either by statute or constitutional am­
endment. The program of the legisla­
ture itself will be the program of the
Nonpartisan league.
On the other hand, says the gov­
ernor, the safe and sane idea will pre­
dominate.
"The farmers will be interested in
legislation of an aid to them," said
Frazier, "but I know care will be tak­
en that the taxes are not boosted un­
necessarily."

Dr. L. T. Guild, publisher of the
Fargo Courier-News during the past
three years, and A. L. Westernhagen,
business manager, have disposed of
their interests to E. S. Fentress and
Chas. E. Marsh, former business man­
ager and editor respectively of the
Des Moines, la., News. Mr. Marsh
will edit the Courier-News and Mr
Fentress will be business manager.
Dr. Guild will spend some time in re­
gaining his health, after which he will
take up chautauqua and lecture work.
Dr. Guild, who is regarded as a ready
writer, gained considerable unpopular­

With this machine the hardness of
the various steels entering into Dodge
Brothers cars is tested and careful
checks are kept on all material.
In testing a piece of steel it is placed
in the machine and a small steel ball of
great hardness is pressed into the
piece to be tested. By the pressure
exerted, which is indicated on a guage,
and by the dimensions of the impres­
sion made on the piece, the operator
is able to make comparison with cer­
tain standard figures and arrive at the
exact hardness of the steel tested.
This method of testing steel has
largely superseded the old method
whereby small steel balls were drop­
ped on the test piece and the height of
the rebound indicated the hardness of
the steel.
Both the machines are the inventions
of J. A. Brinell, a Swedish engineer,
who has a wonderful reputation be­
cause of his knowledge of steel and its
composition.
