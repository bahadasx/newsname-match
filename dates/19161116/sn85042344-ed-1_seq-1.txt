ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 15.- fnless
new und unexpected opposition

Aiiicrlcuu joint commission believed
tonight an agreement, covering the
withdrawal of the American punitive
expedition and a method of border

Announcement that mi agreement

The attitude of the Mexicans, indi
cated by the announcement developed
in i no second session today, although
it was not attended by Luis Cabrera,
c hairman of the Mexican commission,
w lio did not return from Philadelphia
until late tonight. He was accom
janied here by Ambassador-designate

significance seemed to be attached to
the coining of the ambassador since
it had been known for Mime time that
he bad planned to spend n brief holi
day here shortly before the adjourn
ment of the commission.

Although Mr. Cabrera has not been
here since bo manifested his opposi
tion to the plan that was sanctioned
Monday by his colleagues, it Is known
the other Mexicans were In telephonic
communication with him today. It Is
not believed, however, that the unex

Cue to his counsel,
Mr. Cabrera, It now is known, lias
been opposed, apparently unalleruhly,
to the plan as it has been discussed.
There appeared reason to believe that
he hud suggested u rounterplan. but
that his associates (-hose to continue
consideration of the one which had
virtually been agreed upon Monday
afternoon.
Mr. Bonillas denied tonight that
Cabrera had Interfered with the adop
tion of any plan and sought to imply
that the utmost harmony prevailed
among the Mexican delegates.
Minor points are yet tn be consid

the session today that Americans iw
well as the Mexicans appeared to be

a settlement would be reached, oer

World Advertisement Gains
National Recognition
World circulation and Wor. j service mean something
Did you ever notice the advertisements in The World? By that
we mean tho typography of the "ads." their construction and makeup.
They are not lust thrown-together affairs. They are written and
laid out with a view to catching the eye. Tho World advertising de
partment furnishes the services of experts for this purpose
Recently a hall-page "ad" for the Palace Office Supply company
appeared in The World. It was written by a member of The World
advertising force. First of all it contained vitul facts furnished by
the advertiser- facts that Would appeal to the buying public and that
could be bac'ied up by the firm. Next It was written in such a manner
as to bo easily understood at a glance. And last of all it was a piece
of architecture, so arranged typographically that It appealed to the
artistic senses of the render and caught his attention "rigid off the
reel."
A facsimile of that "ad" appears In the current issue of "The
American Stationer (V office Outfitter," nn international trado pub
lication published In New York. This "ad" was selected out of thou
sands all over the nation us one that from every standpoint was a
model one that dealers In similar lines throughout the I'nited States
would do well to follow.
No especial effort was put forward on this particular "ad." The
writing nnd laying out of it was part of the daily routine of the
particular World expert who constructed It. Similar service Is given
every day.
And there you havo In a nutshell tho secret of Tho World's
success.
Eirst clrcufation of quality that reaches people of intelligence
and money, discriminating people.
Second honest -lo-goodness service that gives the advertiser his
money's worth and a little more for good measure.
Tho World believes in co-operation -in giving Hie advertiser the
fullest meusure of benefit out of the money he spends for advettising.
