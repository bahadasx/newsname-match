CRESSET Club.
We most congratulate the
brothers and sitters of Chicago,
for their pride and ambition, in
sending a thrill to our heart and
soul, in the '.great work, they
dona in favor of the two men the
ory, in organizing a CRESSET
Club; For we know that it
takes enthusiasm and patriotism
as well as nerve, to come out
publicly and defy the world of
preachers, and say that God
created one man and then form
ed another man. We ask Bro.
Orr to inform that good sister
Johnson that each one of those
two men have a helpmeet, the
one called female and the other
called woman. In the Bible in
many places the one is called wo
men and the other one woman.
Thi woman in the garden eat
of the forbidden fruit. But we
doiiot rM "where she faught,
with the other women. But
dear sister we do read:
''Salute Rufus chosen in the
Lord, and his mother and mine,
Rom. 16 -13
Here is two mothers, that
tbere is no record given of their
love for each other ever being
broken. So we have a theory of
two women, living peacefully
with each other. Yes sister,
woman can do a great work, hnd
certainly you and your sisters
who helped oriraniza a CRES
SET Club, has done a mighty
work, like Ruth, Naomi. Martha
and Mary. Bro. Orr, we kn
our grammer is short but our
knowledge on the Bible is not
limited neither Is it on Fraternal
Ism, or universal brotherhood,
My heart is made to rejoice to
know that we have a Bro. Orr,
Bro, Goodwin, Bro, Richardson,
Sister Olson, and Sister Johnson
that will give us a little help and
a big encouragement. If we are
poor, and illiterate; help dear
friends all you can. If you have
any old clothes you do not need
send them to us, for young or
old big or little. And -we will
fight with the two men until the
two witnesses of God stand on
their feet and fear cornea on all
who see them. Many thanks
brothers and sisters.

From this Bible fact we learn-
that the Earth cannot be flat.
And yet as above stated it can

fact that God says boll is beneath

the Earth to stand still.

MANCHESTER GUARDIAN
SAYS NEW EPOCH IN U. S.
POLITICS INDICATED.
President Wilson' success to
the rallying of a sufficient num
ber of the Progressive voters,
blch Roosevelt gained in 1912.
"It seems a small thing,'' this
newspaper continues, "but yet
it may indicate a new ejoch in
American political life. The
Progressive movement arose
entirely independently of foreign
politics. Many Progressive
voters given to Wilson are given
itb the mental reservation that'
they will not go again to a Dem
ocratic candidate unless Wilson
confirms the faith of the Pro
gressives by consolidating wha1
is still only tentative. It.ha does
that he will have established
himself as the ablest statesman
since Lincoln and he m&v be
destined to play a part in the
achievement of peace which will
give him a place in the world
history."
iwspapers in England that
rejoiced over President Wilson's
defeat when it was prematurely
announced here now are silent,
Others, which awaited definite
result of the presidential election
in their comment expressed the
conviction that a more vigorous
foreign policy may be expected
from Washington now that the
eleotlon is over.
The Globe, expressing the
opinion that the war, which is
the "only real issue before any
body of civilized men," hardly
entered into the presidental con
test, say 8;
"The mass of American people
ask for nothing more than peace
at almost any price with the
liberty to gather wealth."
Still, the Globe says, the
result is of importance to -the
belligerents and President
Wilson, adding:
No longer preoccupied with
thoughts of votes ' it would not
be surprising if his attitude
toward foreign affairs nnder
went an immediate stiffening.1'
The Pall Mall Gazette says:
'The mere fact of the election
being over is calculated to
strengthen American diplomacy'
The Star says ;
"The most satisfactory feature
of the situation is that while the
return of Mr. Wilson is no
victory for the entente allies, it
Is unquestionably a defeat for
Germany."

PASTOR DISCUSSES
ELECTION.
Sees East Against West in
Future; Women a Factor.
The Rev. L. J. Marshall pastor
of the Wabash Avenue Christian
church delivered a sermon last
night on Significant Events In
Tuesday's Election. t '
''Elections in the future will
be decided by the great mass of
independent voters and also by
the women voters. A 'pleasing
thing about last week's election
was the great vote cast over the
country in the interests of
prohibition."
So did Adam say It was the
woman that beguiled him and
the woman said the serpent
beguiled her, It is well to have
someone to lay it to, but we
mut say that aa long as we are
living under the presantgovern
ment let the majority rule. And
when it comes to Bible Socialism
and Home Industry let God
rule.
