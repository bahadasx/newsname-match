ROAD MASTERS
URGED TO KEEP
UP GOOD WORK
Importance of County High
ways as William Penn
Feeders Pointed Out
DID MUCH WITH LITTLE
Sign Maintenance, Cleaning of
Ditches and Opening of
Culverts Discussed
Dauphin county's township super
visors in midwinter convention to-day
were earnestly urged by County Com
missioner Henry M. Stine to keep up
the pace they have set for maintain
ing the country roads because of their
relative importance as arteries lead
ing into the proposed William Penn
highway, Pennsylvania's cross-state
roadway.
Commissioner Stine, Frank B. Bosch
president of the Motor club of Har
rlsburg and W. A. Winn, engineer of
the bureau of township highways,
State Highway Department were the
principal speakers on the afternoon
program.
While the State official was on the
books to discuss the country road
problems in general and the work m
particular of the township super
visors in co-operating with the State,
President Bosch's talk dealt with the
l oad problem insofar as it relates par
ticularly to the mfctorists.
The session was held in the grand
jury room of the courthouse and prac
tically all of the supervisors attended.
An interesting program had been pre
pared by a committee consisting of
E. L. Sweigard, Susquehanna, Adam
Palmer, Wiconisco, Mathias S. Brinser,
Londonderry, E. D. Messner, Upper
Paxton and 1. F. Bogner, Middle Pax
ton.
The supervisors opened the morn
ing session with a lusty rendition of
"America" which was followed by
devotional exercises conducted by Mr.
Brinser. President Adam Palmer re
viewed the summer's work of the as
sociation and discussed tn nnef the
hopes for the future of the county
road work and the association. H.
M. Fairchilds, Millersburg, talked in
terestingly on the "good roads" day
observance and the remainder of the
morning program was taken up with
a general discussion of the road main
tenance work.
IJoscli Discusses Problems
In his address President Bosch com
mended the supervisors for their work
especially in view of the comparatively
little money that was allowed them.
He referred particularly to the im
portance of keeping posted ,and in
good repair, the cross-roads signs, the
cleaning out of ditches, the opening of
culverts, and the necessity of remov
ing big stones from the highways.
"In conclusion," said President
Bosch, "I just want to thank you men
on behalf of the motorists for what
you have done, are doing and will do
to solve the good road problem. For
you who have been so faithful in
doing these things I've enumerated I
want to express my heartiest thanks
to you who have been unable to do
them, I want to urge you to give these
questions all the attention you can."
Dr. Stine had a word of commenda
tion for the work that has been done
by the supervisors on their limited al
lowances. He cited one instance
where one man kept his thirty miles
of roads in good shape on about $2,-
400 a year.
"You men," said the commissioner
"have done admirable work and I
wnnt to say on behalf of the com
missioners that we are entirely in
sympathy with you and want to do,
and intend to do all we can with the
money that is at disposal. I do want
to urge upon you the importance of
keeping the country roads in good
shape because these in time will be
the smaller arteries that will lead
into Pennsylvania's cross-
State road—the William Penn High
way."
BONUS FOR "WATER WAGON"
Pittsburgh, Pa., Nov. 16. Five
cents an hour for "staying on the
wagon" is being paid in Johnstown.
To give old John Barleycorn a knock
out blow, an employer has made an
agreement with several skilled work
ers to pay them at the end of the job
on which they are engaged, five cents
for every hour they have worked if
they stay sober. And the plan, ac
cording to reports, is working.

PLAN SURVEY OF
RELIGIOUS WORK
IN FOUR STATES
Protestant Episcopal Board Of
Education to Conduct
Big Research
AFFECTS ALL SCHOOLS
Question of Establishing Sum
mer Schools Taken Up; Dr.
Gardner Speaks
A complete survey of Sunday school
work and religious education in
schools, colleges and theological
seminaries in Pennsylvania, Mary
land, Virginia, Delaware and the Dis
trict of Columbia, was decided upon
this morning by the Board of Relig
ious Education of the Province of
Washington of the Protestant Episco
pal church, covering that territory.
The survey will be probably one of
the most complete ever made and
work will be started at once by a spe
cial committee of the board including
the Rev. Dr. S. U. Mitman, of South
Bethlehem, field secretary; the Rev.
Dr. Frederick Gardner. Mt. Airy,
school secretary; and the Rev. Dr.
Bartlett, dean of the Philadelphia
Divinity School, representing theolog
ical schools.
The board also decided 011 the time
and place of its two next meetings.
The first will be held January 18, 1917
at Hampton, Va„ and the second at
Hagerstown, Md., April 2 4 and 25.
At the latter meeting the Sunday
school committee of the board will
meet also. The provincial board also
recommended this morning that the
General Board of Religious Education
urge the observance of the centennial
anniversary of the founding of Sunday
school work in Protestant Episcopal
churches. This work was started in
1817. Reports of committees and
officers were received yesterday and
disposed of so that action on new
business could be taken this morning.
This morning Dr. William E. Gard
ner, of New York, general secretary
of the general board, opened an ad
dress on the work of that body. He
continued his talk this afternoon after
which the committee on summer
schools met. Last summer seven
summer schools were conducted in
this province, more than were held
in all the other provinces in the Unit
ed States. Bishop Rogers Israel,
president of the board, presided. To
night he will speak at the closing
meeting in St. Stephen's church on
"Religious Education in the Home."
Twenty-One Counties Still
to Be Heard From Officially
in the State of California
San Francisco, Nov. 16. Twenty
one counties in California remain to be
heard from to-day in the official can
vass of the presidential election of
November 7, the twenty-one including
the most populous of the State, Los
Angeles, Alameda, San Francisco, San
Diego and Sacramento.
When the count was resumed to
day the highest Republican elector
was credited with 118,228 votes, while
the lowest Democrat had 132,068, a
plurality for the lowest Democratic
elector of 13,840.
As no notable upsets in the first un
official returns have yet been noted,
State Democratic leaders predict their
lowest elector will run ahead of the
highest Republican elector by about
600 votes.
A. F. of L. Plans to Stop
Emigration of Southern
Negroes to the North
Baltimore, Nov. 16. The emigra
tion of Southern negroes to Northern
labor centers was brought to the at
tention of the convention of the Amer
ican Federation'of Labor to-day when
the committee on organization favor
ably reported a resolution designed
to eliminate what was characterized
as a "menace to the workers in the
Northern States."
Cabrera's Stand May
Delay Border Agreement
Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 16.
Interest in the session of the Mexican-
American joint commission to-dap was
in learning what would be the atti
tude of Luis Cabrera, chairman of the
Mexican Commission. During his ab
sence at Philadelphia, Ignacio Bonil
las and Alberto J. Pani, the other
Mexican representatives virtually
agreed with the American Commis
sion on the essential points of a plan
of border control. They expressed
confidence in the support of Mr. Ca
brera, notwithstanding the opposition
offered by him on Tuesday, the last
time he appeared in the conference.
The optimism displayed by the two
Mexican commissioners was not shar
ed by all those in touch with the con
ferees early to-day. By a few of them
it w&h regarded as not improbable
that Mr. Cabrera might again stand in
the way although ail preparations
have been made for reducing to writ
ing the agreement, and Mr. Bonillas
and Mr. Pani appeared confident that
another hitch would be avoided. Mr.
Cabrera remained noncommittal.
BRADLEY WITHDRAWS
Boston, Nov. 16. Col. J. Payson
Bradley of this city, to-aay announced
the withdrawal of his candidacy for
commander-in-chief of the Grand
Army of the Republic. His name had
been put forward by New England
veterans at the last encampment at
Kansas City as their choice for the
post next year. In a statement ex
plaining his withdrawal, Col. Bradley
said that as the national encampment
would be held in this city he thought
it unfair to ask the delegates to vote
for a Massachusetts man for the high

When, some months ago, the newspapers told stories about them
marching away to Mexico, they called theni "Top" Sergeant Charles W.
Thomas, Second Lieutenant Robert D. Jenkins and Captain Frank E. Zieg
ler, officers of Company I. one of Harrisburg's crack Guard companies
which enlisted with Uncle Sam.
Gone are "Top" Sergeant Thomas, Lieutenant Jenkins and Captain Zieg
ler. They'll never come back again. Instead First Lieutenant Charles W.
Thomas, Captain Robert D. Jenkins Major Frank E. Ztegler, one of the
battalion commanders of the Eighth—will come marching home.
The answer is simple. During the tour of Texas duty occurred the
changes that could be expected in a big army under the circumstances and
during the last week or two, "Captain" Ziegler succeeded Major Vale who
resigned. Ordinarily that vacancy would have been tilled by First Lieu
tenant Charles Hi Chambers, but he had long since been appointed to the
machine gun company and Lieutenant Jenkins filled his shoes. Sergeant
Thomas was chosen to succeed Jenkins. •
WILSON TO FIGHT
HIGH FOOD COST
No Embargo on Wheat Exports
Will Be Laid by the
President
Washington, D. C.. Nov. 10.—Presi
dent Wilst n has determined person
ally to take charge of a general In
vestigation into the high cost of living.
Convinced that the present high
prices of food and all other products
regarded as necessaries of life are due,
partly at least, to artificial causes, the
President has determined to gather
the reins of the various Inquiries al
ready under way and personally direct
the attempt to bring about a solution.
It was learned that the President in
the near future will confer with Cabi
net members of the Federal Trade
Commission in order to evolve a pro
gram for dealing with the problem of
high prices.
It can be stated authoritatively that
there will be no embargo on wheat or
foodstuffs now being sent to Europe.
As a student of history, the President
is aware that whenever embargoes
have been laid by the United States
the effect has been disastrous to the
trade and industry of the United
States.
An embargo on wheat, the Presi
dent realizes, would lead to an endless
chain, affecting harmfully most agri
culture and manufactured products.
Whatever remedies are adopted will
be different in their nature from em
bargoes. The Federal Trade Commis
sion, for instance, has found that there
are combinations in fertilizers and that
farmers have suffered from a scarcity
of nitrates.
The Department of Justice has al
ready Inquired into t lie coal situation
to learn whether the increase in prices,
based on wage Increases, have been
out of proportion. There will be simi
lar inquiries all alone the line into the
percentage of profit of the middlemen.
Increasing the productive energies
of the nation, inquiring into alleged
combinations, a study of the market
ing system, more direct relations be
tween the consumers and producers,
releasing some energies now restricted
by legislation, are among the matters
to which the President will give his
personal attention in his conference
with the heads of the departments.
TO RUSH SUITS
ON 8-HOUR LAW
Department of Justice Wants
Early Decision by Supreme
Court
Washington, D. C.. Nov. 16. —Karly
decision by the Supreme Court of one
of the railroad suits attacking the
constitutionality of the eight-hour law
probably will be sought by the Depart
ment of Justice. An appeal probably
will be made in the first case decided
In the hope that the Supreme Court
may he able to pass judgment as near
| as possible by January 1, when the law
would become effective if not sus
pended by injunction.
A decision in the highest court
would be binding on all lower Federal
.courts and might dispose of all other
suits. The department's policy has
not been finally settled, but it was said
to-day that this course is being consid
ered and probably would he followed.
If an appeal is taken, the court would
be asked to advance the case, and in
view of its importance officials feel
that such a motion would be granted,
since such procedure is not unusual.
Official notice of the filing of sixteen
suits had been received to-day by the
department, but no determination was
reached as to where it would endeavor
to have the first hearing.
Preparations were being made to
day for the meeting Monday of the
joint congressional committee to in
vestigate railroad questions, including
government ownership. The commit
tee has sent notices to every state gov
ernor and attorney general and all
ttate, railroad commissions, to com
mercial and industrial organizations
and to the president of every railroad
in the country.
25,000 TROOPS
IN BIG MANEUVER
Guardsmen and Regulars in
Most Extensive War
Game
Brownsville, Texas, Nov. 16.—Twen
ty-five thousand soldiers comprising!
National Guardsmen from nine States
and several regular army organiza
tions to-day began what army officers
declare to be the most extensive man
euver attempted since the coming of
the National Guard to the Mexican
border. The soldiers are about equal
ly divided into two armies, one to be
known as "the Brown army" the other
to be known as the "White Army."
The invading force, the "Brown
Army" is to try to wrest a large sec- |
tion of territory known as the "lower
Rio Grande valley" from the "White
Army," the defending force, which is
to be stationed in the neighborhood of
Llano Grande, 46 miles west of
Brownsville. The territory in which
the armies are to be active is bound
ed on the east by the Gulf of Mexico,
on the south by the Rio Grande, on
the north by Ilarlingen, 29 miles north
jof Brownsville and on the west by
i 1-lano Grande camp, 17 miles west of
[ Harlingen.
The "Brown Army" probably will
be in command of Brigadier General
H. A. Allen, of the lowa brigade.
The "White Army" probably will be
I in command of Brigadier General F.
; M. Bewis, commanding the First Bri-
I gade, Minnesota infantry.
