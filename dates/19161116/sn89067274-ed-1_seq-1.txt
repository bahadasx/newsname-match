The restaurant and pool hall on East
Park street, owned' and operated by
Dave Gibbs, colored, was destroyed
by fire early Tuesday evening. The
fire company responded to an alarm
sent in at 7:40, and when they reach
ed the scene it was found, that, ow
ing to the distance to the nearest fire
plug, the hose carried on' the fire
wagon was not sufficient to reach the
building, and the wagon returned to
the fire house for more hose, ine
second string of hose enabled them to
reach the burning building, but not
the building immediately east of it
owned by Gibbs and occupied by Clif
Lee. Another trip back to tne lire
house was made and more hose was
