Mississippi's prospects of be
lling a leader in hog produc
Vm were greatly brightened by
ie recent organization of a State
Awine Breeders' Association.
An enthusiastic report of their
Weeting was given out here re

(.Vpterinarian. on his return from
r i ,i
Jackson. Miss., wnere ine meei-
Snrr vena held in connection with"
I the State Fair.
Hit. T
More than 150 breeders of pure
bred hogs were enrolled as char
ter members of the Association.
In addition to these, all ' mem
bers of the pig clubs in the state
were enrolled as honorary mem
t! Kara A a there are hfteen nun-
dred of these club members, Dr.
J
i Ranck predicts a total member-
Bv,;n of two thousand within a
short time. 1 i
The purpose of the association
is io encourage the breeding,

i Nation and control of all infec-
tious and contagious, diseases, of

lege, cooperating with farmers,
breeders, and bankers of the
state.
Feed
Sold Through Cattle Will
Bring High Prices
Farmers wha have surplus
feedstuffs this fall may hope to
obtain unusually high prices for
them by selling them through
beef cattle as there are indica
tions that there will be fewer
beeves fed - for market this
winter than last on account of
the scarcity of feed. These con
ditions prevail over the entire
country, and the man who has
enough roughage to carry a few
head of cattle or better still has
both roughage aid concentrates,
stands a chance to make a nice
profit next spring."
I. W.' Carpenter, of the Missis
sippi A. and M. College, recent
ly made this statement, but says
that not only is the number of
cattle fed out for market in
creasing in Mississippi, but that
the quality is much better, and
the methods of handling and
feeding are improving from year
to year.
Anioncr the precautions that
the feeder will do well to bear
in mind is the necessity of start-
in tt feedinff before" the cattle
begin losing weight, which
generally; comes" after the first
hard frost. It is best to begin
by giving all the roughage that
the cattle will eat combined with
two or tnree pounds of cotton-
BPPrt mpl or cake, and to
hold them on this until
they are ready to go on full
feed. The full feeding period
generally lasts from 75 to 120
days for best results, and it has
been found best to feed for
April, May and June markets as
the prices are usually higher
then than on the earlier markets.
Calves and yearlings do better
when fed from" 120 to 160 days,
and a good practice is to feed
these immature cattle some con
centrate other than cotton sed
meal for at least a part of their
ration. The man who rs short
soughage and expects to get his
cattle fattened at an early date
will probably find it to advantage
to feed 750 to 850 pound steers,
which are Usually put on full
feed in Mississippi as early as
possible.
These steers may be started on
what silage they can clean up
gnr) ,s nnunds of cottonseed meal
a head daily. This ration is in
creased at the rate of one pound
of cottonseed meal a week unti
the cattle are on full feed, which
consists of about six pounds of
cottonseed meal and what silage
they will take.

Sheep Raising Proving Profitable
I in Mississippi
"Owing to the high price of
wool and mutton, and to the fact
that winter lambs can be pro
duced under natural conditions
in the South more economically
than hothouse lambs can ( be
grown further north, sheep rais
ing is sapidly becoming an im
portant industry for Missis
sippi," says 1. w. carpenter,
extension livestock specialist of
the Mississippi A. and M. Col
lege, who is cooperating with
many faamers in improying their
livestock.
Mr. Carpenter states, however,
that those men having sheep
will do well to provide shelters
and a good supply of hay or sil
age for them during the winter
months. Where lespedeza, cow-
peas, soybeans, or some other
good legume hay is available no
concentrate is necessary, but in
case grass hay or silage is used
the sheep will need one-fourth
to one-half pound of cottonseed
meal in addition. While the
flock might winter solely on the
stalk fields, stronger and more
vigorons lambs and a better
quality may be produced by
feeding and caring for the flock
through the cold season.
$218 From 90 Hens in 8 Months;
as Side Line
- Many Mississippi farm women
are making their household ex
penses and adding to the farm
income by giving attention to
marketing their . poultry pro
ducts.,' -What is being done by
some of. the members of the co
operative egg and poultry asso
ciation maintained at the Missis
sippi A. and M. College by the
farmers of the community, can
be duplicated anywhere in the
state. E. P. Clayton, head of
the poultry department, and
secretary of the association,
gives the following figures from
the record of Mrs. J. P. Castles,
President of the Association.
During the 8 months ending
September 1st. Mrs. Castles sold
$122.01 worth of eggs at market
prices from 90 hens, and during
the same time sold breeding
stock to the value of 19.50 and
breeding eggs to the value of
$70.65, making a total of gross
income of $218.16, at a cost of
$45.50 worth of feed purchased.
No account was taken of' home
grown feed as this was more
than offset bv 75 oullets and 22
cockerels left on the yard and
valued at one dollar each. ..
In this same period, Miss
Eudora Carpenter, another mem
ber of the association made a net
profit of $155.T)5 from 65 hens,
cost of feed and laborconsidered.
Tn bnth cases the feed used
was corn, wneat. cononseea
mealTand oats, supplemented by
green feeds and skimmilk
Wheat bran, corn meal, and
cottonseed meal were fed in the
form of dry mash, using equal
Darts of each. ' No account was
taken in either case of the eggs
ond oViiVkens used for the home
table.
Water Works Week is here.
From the . 12th to the 18th of
November, Mississippi's chief
interest will be aiding farmers
in installing home water works.
Meetings will be held in every
county in the state. Plan3 and
bills of material for water works
systems costing from? $18.40 to
$128.80 have been worked out by
the agricultural engineer, Agri-
cyltural College, Miss., and will
be sent free on request
MRS. MAMIE HALL
GAINS 19 POUNDS
Was Sick in Bed
Months and Only
Pounds.
for Eleven
Weighed 96
Still another comes forward
and adds her voice to the hun
dreds who have already endors
ed the wonderful medicine, Tan-
lac. . Mrs. Mamie Hall, who
lives at 800 Fourth Avenue,
South Nashville, says she suffer
ed for years and that the trouble
was finally pronounced cancer of
the stomach. She also states
that she had fallen off as a result
of the trouble until she weighed
only 96 pounds, but that she
now weighs 115, a gain of 19
pounds."
"I had a bad form of stomach
troubl," said Mrs. Hall in relat
ing her remarkable - case to a
TanlaC representative, "and had
suffered from it for years. I
lost so much flesh and was so
weak that I was confined to my
room and bed for eleven months
and my head ached so bad I could
hardly stand it at times. "Yes,"
she continued, "they actually
had to prop me. up in bed to take
a drink of -water, as I iust
couldn't help myself at all. I
lived on malted milk and Graham
kp'ra. The steadv Dains in
mv chest made me afraid I had
lung trouble and my head ached
so bad seemed like it would burst.
About a year ago I was taken
to a hospital, the doctor saying
I had cancer of the stomach. I
was so nervous all this time
that the slightest noise would
almost drive me mad. and the
pains ih my back hurt me. so .1
hardly ever got a night s rest
"My husband was terribly out
of heart about me, as the doctor
said nothing would save me but
an operation, -We had spent a
lot of money for medicines and
it seemed like nothing would do
any good.
"Well sir. I haonened to see a
piece in the paper about Tanlac,
and it told about a woman in
Louisville that was suffering just
exactly the same way I was. -I
begged my husband to let me try
it and he said he had no faith in
it, but he would get it if 1 want
ed it. So he got a bottIe-and we
kept it a secret from the doctor.
'That was the best thing 1
ever did in my life, for I began
to feel better and -gain weight
with the very first dose: -I had
cone down so I didn't weigh but
96 nounds. but now, after takirg
four bottles, I weigh 115-?.ve
pounds more than I ever did in
my life.
I now feel stronc and well
and can do all my housework. I
can eat anything why, I actual -
w . . i
lv ate a tomato after I had been
-
taking Tanlac a week, and that's
something ' that never would
agree with me before. I have
no more of those terriblepains
and lam doing fine in everyway.
"I got a letter yesterday from
my husband at Chattanooga, and
he. said he had taken two bottles
of Tanlac and was doing fine. I
am going . to Chattanooga "Sun
day,, and will sure take a -bottle
of Teniae in my grip.. This med
icine just about saved my life
and kept me from . having to
have an operation,
"Yes," she continued, you
can print it I want everybody
to know about it I don't think
folks ought to be too modest to
prevent 'all the suffering they
can.
Surelv this is a most couvinc-
ing case of suffering and distress
being alleviated by the use of a
tomach corrective and tonic
which relieves the condition that
give3 rise to bo many different
symptoms of deadly disease. It
is not claimed that' Tan lac alone
produces flesh. This great med
icine frees the system from poi
sons arising from the
improper
digestion of the food and helps
nature turn the food into
strength and puts the body in
good working order. Then the
body gains back its normal
weight as naturally as water
flows down hill.
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in Houlka exclusively by J.
W. HOWARD & SON.

U. D. C. Notes
On the first Friday in October
we met at Mrs. Lela Hawkins',
a dear sweet woman.
Some text books- bearing on
Lee and Jackson as onspicuous
leaders in the civil war, recon
struction period, etc., were dis
tributed. Our resident Mrs. Walter
Smith, seemed to have surpassed
any previous occasion in her se
lection of a program, which was,
after the usual devotional exer
cises, first a brief history oi tne
Okolona chapter up to date, lit
tle incidence were related by
'Aunt Laura" also an "old
time" song from her, a couple
of sweet songs from Mrs. Ed
Buchanan, music from Miss 'M.
Trimmier. a recitation from Mrs.
James Gordon, all of which were
very enjoyable. '
Miss Mollie Trimmier put inmo-
tion a suggestion that each mem
ber give 5c towards a scholar
ship for some poor but worthy
boy, each chapter in the state is
so doing. Motion was carried.
This seems little, but "Little
things make of life the sum."
The meeting was then "turn
ed over" to the hostess who
served two dainty courses of re
freshments. As we adjourned to meet at
Mrs. Doud McCarley's, Nov. 1st,
several remarked that .Fannie
Kate out did herself.
True "to appointment about
twenty-two met at Mrs. McCar-
ley's. Our spirits were in uni
son with the lovely afternoon.
On this decasion, however, it
was "business before pleasure."
After the house was called to
order several important letters,
were read. One among the
number was from our Governor
in which he requested that the
ladies in each county contribute
$25.00 towards the enlarging and
bettering the Home at Beauvoir,
the same he asks of the men..
'Many hands make light work."
An application to join from
Mrs. Ed Buchanan was consid
ered. Then-officers for 1917
were elected as follows: Presi
dent Miss Mollie Trimmier; Vice
president, Mrs. McDowell, Sr. ;
H. V. P., Mrs. Laura Murdoch;
Treasurer, Mrs. Laura Harrell;
Recording Secretary, Mrs. Cora
Gates; Corresponding Secretary,
Mrs. M. B. Dottery; Historian,.
Mrs. D. McCarley; Custodian,
Mrs. Maggie Pannell; Reporter
Mrs. J. K. Glidewell.
After refreshments were taste
fully served and some- very deep
regrets expressed in regard to a
loss especially of our President,
though gladly welcoming our
new'one, we gave a rising vote
of thanks to our old President
for faithful services well render
ed, also to other officers and to
hostess and adjourned.
