From the time ot th landing of the
Pilgrim Fathers, Americans have been
accustomed to let aside one day In the
year wherein to review the past year
and take (lock ot the dealings of
Providence with us as a eople.
What was at first the spontaneous
expression of grateful hearts soon be
came a custom, and ns the Tears sped
this custom became fixed, until today
it assumes the sacrednets cf a per
mament institution.
Tuisvason Is again with us The
fruits of the broad acres of our fair
domain have been garnered in. The
warehouses and granaries are fairly
bursting with the'tr contents and pros
perity sets a guest at almost every fire
side.
Our President and the governors of
the various states have designated the
day cm which the people shall expres
to a boutiful Creator their gratitude
for these blessings.
And to the many positive and ma
ten'il Meetings which have been ours,
run is added oil this ocefction the
clla! uieing that we as a people
hare escaped the. madness that has
fallen as a blight upon our neighbors
and kinsmen acrosa the waters, The
magnitude of that blessing we cannot
at this timelxgin to estimate.
But while we have theso palpable
blessings fir which to be thankful, we
have other things for which to express
our gratitude, and these antedate and
underlie our present happiness and
prosperity, our peace and safety. We
have to be thai.kful that back in the
days when our nation was being born,
a land of heroes, than whom the
world has never produced greater, had
impressed upon their hearts to lay the
foundations of that nation upon the
only poMible true and lasting base
the Fatherhood of an omnipotent God
and the brotherhood ot man.
And we have to be thankful that all
down the years since that there have
been heroic souls worthy sons of
noble sires who have never ceased to
call to us with clarion voices to watqh
and preserve the old landmarks, to
plant our feet upon that everlasting
rock and stand firm.
And over and above all else, we have
to be thankful that a merciful Qpd,;
has tojnoulued the Jiearfd ajid.llves of
the people ol this nation that we aro
enabled to look about and beyond self
and seo for ourselves the great princi
ples of eternal truth and justice that
must uii.11110.Rjjr ruieH iiitjwiiuit" eariu,
that we are enabled to grasp the truth
that an Injury to ourselves, and that a
kindness to our fellows calls down a
benediction upon our own heads.
So that the one supreme blessing tor
which we should at this season return
thanks, is the fact that our God has
enabled us as a people to know and to
do the right
And let our prayer be, that it may
ever be thus with this people.

AN APPEAL TO COMMUNITY LOYAUTY.
It will not be lcng now until the
holiday shopping will be in full swing,
and before It opens we wish to have a
few words with our fellow citizens on
the quest oi ot how and where this
holiday money is to be spent.
Aro you going to patronize the mail
order housps this year as perhaps many
of jou did last year? Or are you going
to, If necessary, even make a slight
sacriflce and stick to homo people?
Whence camn the money that you
are intending to send to that mail
order concern? Did it come from the
city in which that concern is located?
Not by a long shot. If you ar a
fanner it is tho product nf the soil.
What soil? Why, the soil of ycir
community. ow yuu', at a pratical
farmer, know full well the results of
(he runious practice ot taking every
thing from your land and returning
nothing to it, You know this ptaetice
mustsooner or later impoverish your
soil and destroy your snrce of income.
Can't you realize that in seodiug
I your money away from home you are
UoiriR to thcuummuntty just what you
fould not think of doing to your farm
robbing it of its productive power?
You certainly are. Every dollar sent
away from your community robs it of
just that much of power for good.
But pereapsyou are not a farmer,
but a machanlc, or trader. Then the
responsibility rest even more heavily
upon you to keep your money in the
home channels of trade, because all of
It comes from the heard earnings ot
your neighbors and friends, and you
have no right to deprive commun
ity of the good It can do i'. culated
therein,
Yes, we say no right JIo man has
any right to be disloyal to his com
munity Deprive any min entirely ot
community support and becomes a
parish worse than a Robinson Crusoe,
for he is among his kind but not of
them. What loneliness could be
more terrible?
If, then, you are thus dependent on
your neighbors and friends, do you
not owe them an equal allegiance?
Are they to consult your interests
while you ignore theirs? This were
ingratitude of the basest sort.
Just suppose, you patron of the mail
order house, that for a period of twelve
mouths every citizens of your county
followed your example and did all of
his trading away from home? What
condition would your country be in?
Would there be a solvent merchant in
it? Not one. What of your schools,
your churches, and all the civilizing
institutions of our land? They might
still survive if you bear all expense-
not otherwise.
Think seriously of these things, you
patron of the mail order house, fieal
Ize that if you have the right to de
prive your community of your money,
all your neighbors have equal right
then Imagine the consequences.
Don't bo an Ingrate! If you have a
dollar to spend, spend it at home.
Thus it stays and work in the county
in which you are interested. Sond it
away and It Is gone forever.
