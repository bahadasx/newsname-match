"White Pine Camp No. 213 here last
night at a public speaking in the city
auditorium and a delightful banquet
served afterwards at the Kentucky
Home hotel.
Mr. Fraser and his party were met
at the depot by a committee of Hen
dersonville citizens, and immediately
after getting off the 5:15 train were
taken over the city, riding in the car
with John T. Wilkins and R. M. 0ate3.
They were preceded by the Henderson
ville band and about 40 automobiles
followed. The Noterman property, the
site of the proposed Root memorial
park, v,as circled; then up Main street
and back to the Park Hill hotel where
the guests stopped while in the city.
At S o'clock, notwithstanding th3
cold weather, the auditorium of the
city hall was well filled with Woodmen
and their friends for the speaking.
John T. Wilkins had charge of the
meeting, and Rev. T. E. Simpson, pas
tor of the Presbyterian church, led Jn
prayer. Mr. Wilkins introduced Dis
trict Deputy V. E. Grant; who intro
duced E. B. Lewis. Mr. Lewis in turn
presenting Mr. Fraser.
Mr. Fraser's adddress was highly
enjoyed and he interspersed his words
of thought with witty stories which
kept the audience in good humor air
the way through.. -
"I am glad of the privilege of com
ing to North Carolina," .said thespeak
er, "and I told "Lewis, who made the
aates for me 10 oe sure ana inciuao
Hendersonville. I have found North
Carolina to be a revelation of a life
time. Having always thought of the
state as a place where nothing but
cotton and colored folks were raised,
I was agreeably surprised to see so
many manufacturing plants and other
industries flourishing, but. the greatest
asset North Carolina has is the Wood
men of the World. While the power
plants, the furniture factories, the cot
ton mills, give employment to thou
sands, thereby enabling them to earn
a livlihood, the W. O. W. stands for
protection of the home and assures in
dependence for the widows and chil
dren should adversity overtake tha
head of the house.
'There is one town in North Caroli
na that somehow I have always want
ed to visit, and that town is Hender
sonville. It was here that on Decem
ber 24, 1913. that the founder of the
great order of which I am now at the
head, died, and for this reason I have
always wanted to visit your city. I
am sorry the hotel where he breathed
his last is burned down, but am glad
to meet the good men and women who
administered to him during his last,
hours.
"Some time ago I went to New York
where I executed a contract -with
Tiffany for a magnificent memorial
window to the memory of Mr. Root
which when completed will le placed
in the splendid Woodmen of the World
building at Omaha.
"The Woodmen of the World was or
ganized in 1890 and has far exceeded
the dreams of the founder. Starting
without capital and without stock the
society now has over 800.000 members
and has $30,000,000 held in reserve in
its vaults.
"The ladies make the -work of our
order much easier and far more suc
cessful and for them there has been
founded the Woodmen Circle. The so
ciety came into existence for the pur.
se jf making it easy for a man to
i'rov&e for his family after-he passes
aay. The 800,000 Sovereigns in' the
r,rder carry protection amounting to
5,000,000. ranging in amounts of
trm $500 to $3,000. so that their
lves and mother and children will
enabled to care for themselves in
'he event that the sovereign die$; '
The society Is imioue above all
0?hers in one particular. No member
i;l sleep in an unmarked grave. 'iSvery
-teased member has a monument
er-ctea to his memory costing $100. . .
''The society has Invested In North
Carolina $3;000,000 in road, municipal
school bonds, and right in 'Hen-'-3onvilie
has 'invested $25,000. in
bridge and funding bonds. I regret
we haven't invested $10,000,000 in
orth Carolina bonds for they are rilt
edge. Hereafter when North Carolina
Dnds are offered lis we will buy them
Without Question, and they ought to
be on par with those of New York and
Illinois because of; the manufacturing
interests here."
He said the local camp was as 'en-,
"siastie as aRy to be found any
;"ere and paid tribute to V. E. Grant

Speeches Were Made by X. W. Walker
of Chapel Hill and W. H. Hipps of
AsheTille Prizes Given.
Lined up in brilliant array, the sev
eral schools of Mills River township
Friday, November 10, at a signal's
sound, started from Whitaker & Dav
enport's store for the Mills Rivcr
school building. A long train W wa?T
ons, buggies, and automobiles loaded
with school children, parents and
friends flags waving - and children
yelling to the top of their voices was
1 formed hv each school which was led
1 with a float from that school. Much
'enthusiasm was manifested along the
entire parade. The parade was led !7
Rugby school while Smoky Hollow
brought up the rear. Each school
(Smoky Hollow, Mills River and Rue
by) presented a good display with their
beautiful floats and their enthusiastic
boys and girls. Large crowds greeted
the children along the parade.
Gd Speeches.
Among those who were watching the
parade was Prof. N. W. Walker of
Chapel Hill, N. C. Immediately after
the floats and other vehicles arrived at
the. school building, the older people
assembled in the school auditorium
where they were addressed by Prof.
Walker and Supt. W. H. Hipps of Ashe
ville. Both speeches were interesting
and to the point on better equipment
for thejschools.
: In "substance Mr. Walker said that
it was not a dream, that could not be
realized.. - for Mifls River "to have a
Farm. Life school to prepare thQjroung
menand. women f or, .thef yjejeations that
they wished to- follow. "Mr. Hipps
went right "to the point on what Mills
River should do in the way of school
improvements and made a convincing
speech on school improvements.
Fine Exhibits.
After the speaking, " the doors were
opened to all of the exhibits inside the
school rooms. Exhibits of apples,
farm products, handicraft (works), old
pieces of hand work, fancy work,
crocheting, embroidery and tatting,
canned goods, preserves, cakes, pies,
breads and various other things were
on'.
In the exhibition of farm products
large turnips, squash, and pumpkins
added considerably to the general ap
pearance Of the rooms; in the exhibits
of old articles .. could be found bed
spreads more than a century and 20
years old, horns used in the Revolu
tionary war, a bible 200 years old, and
numerous other things of interest.
. The fancy work was excellent
throughout. Each school presented a
fine exhibit of needle work. The ex
hibit in this line would compare favor
ably with work done in schools where
domestic science. and art are taught;
breads, pies, cakes, etc., were no lesi
to be considered.
The exhibits werenconfined mostly o
farm products and the works of do
mestic science and art. However, there
were some farm exhibits of animals.
The people of Mills River hope to
have exhibits of live stock at next
year's fair.

UCCESS
HUSTLER KEPT
GIVING ELECTION RETURNS
From the time the polls closed on
Tuesday until the certala re-election
of President Wilson became' known
late Thursday night the Hustler office
was besieged with anxious- inquiries
from both men and women, wanting
to know the reeults of the election,
and all were answered to the best of
our ability. Through the,splendid co
operation of Manager Carpenter or the
Western Union and the operators at
the local telephone exchange- we were"
enabled to keep pretty well posted on
the way things were going ,and out
side of the conflicting claims made oy
the managers for Britt and Weaver at
Asheville, almost definite jreturns
could be given in every Instance. On
Tuesday night returns were given by
the Western Union every few minutes
and the telenhone was kept busy get
ting returns from the county. By ten
o'clock Tuesday night the result in
the county from all precincts was
'practically definitely known. At that
hour judging from returns from the
eastern states the election of Hughes
I seemed a certainty, but later th the
night those who remained at the Hust
ler office began to see that Wilson was
gaining and Democrats then began to
!see a ray of hope. At three o'fijock
Wednesday morning they went to their,
homes feeling that the dawn of day
i would bring much better tidings and
In this they were; not -disappointed
All day Wednesday the suspense
continued and the Hustler office was
besieged by; inquiries both by tele
phone and in person. It is estimated
the nnerators at the local telephone
that over 1,000 calls were put. up for
the Hustler's single telephone during
the day and night.
Thursday night the glad news came
that Wilson had carried California and
apparently was elected. Then the
crowd dispersed, feeling that their
ceaseless vigil had been sufficiently
awarded.

18 STILL II
Last week on the face of unofficial
returns from the, tenth district, the
Hustler announced that Zebulon
Weaver had been elected to congress
by a majority of 100 votes. Later de
velopments, however, showed that
semLofficial returns from over the dis
trict 'gave Mr. Britt a majority of 13.
Moreover. 'the Buncombe county elec
tion' board,' after v canvassing a part of
the returns from Buncombe county,
adjourned- without certifying the con.
gfessional vote, to meet again this
(Thursday) afternoon to go over the
vote. ' - . -
in the meantime- both sides have
gotten busy, charges and counter
charges have been made until the sit
uation has become somewhat complex
and : decidedly perplexing. The fight
now'' seems to hinge7 on the unmarked
ballots 'that wer"e cast, and a dispatch
from .Washington; says there will be a
pntesT in Congress no matter in whose
favor the election is decided.
: Congressman Britt's Statement.
l I am resting my case solely upon
he ballots regularly, legally cast atvtho
polls, and'up to this hour have made
no harges whatever against anybody ;
riot that-J have.nqt abundant grounds
Or compfaints. but because I know that
I am entitled to my certificate of elec
tion on. the face of the official returns,
avnd feel that the "matter should rest
there.' Mr. Weaver now contends that
unmarked ballots-should be counted
when he knows that the Democratic at
torney general. Democratic state board
of elections, and his Democratic chair
man, D.,S. Ellas, have each and all
held he law to be that all ballots must
bemarked in order to be valid; not
only this:-but his chairman, who hap
pens also io be chairman of the coun
ty-boardr', of elections, marked every
Weaver ticket before sending them out,
as his own letters now in my posses
sion purtdantly?: prove-while in ythe
sahieetters hV stated he was sending
out my ballots unmarked and that the
Republicans could mark, them on tho
day of election, when they received
them,
"Mr. Weaver and his friends should
be the last to complain. I have beat
en him at the polls, under election ma
chinery provided by the Democratic
party. Both his ballots and'mine read
as follows: 'To vote this ticket, make
cross mark in square Knowing that
this question had been threshed out
before the Democratic state board of
elections, by the Democratic attorney
general and also that every Demo
cratic election official from state board
elections down had so decreed it, I in
structed my friends generally to abide
by It and observe it fully, which they
did, with the result that I lost heavily
on that account, 29 votes in one coun
ty, and almost an equal number in an
other, and from one to 10 in many pre
clncts throughout the district.
"X have won this election against the
most fearful odds against w.iii any
man ever battled. I had to contend
against federal, state, county and mu.
niclpal officers; a solid opposition
press, as well as the tremendous pop
ularity of President .Wilson. In spite
of all these odds I have won, ani
Weaver now proposes to revoke the
election laws and regulations all made
by his party, in order to destroy my
majority and get the certificate of elec
tion, to which he must know he is not
entitled. But he and his friends have
not reckoned with the public. The
great Democratic masses will not up
hold him In this, he will find that the
eople regardless of party will not sup
port him in this unwarranted effort to
deprive me of my election.
"On. last Tuesday the American peo
pie re-elected Wilson president of tile
United States. We republicans bow to
their will without complaint. On the
same day the people of this district re
elected me to Congress, and Weaver
and his friends should as cheerfully
concede my election and accord to the
Republicans their rights'
- The Democratic Tiew.
The Democratic vitw of th? situa
tion, as it now stands folio- 3:
"If the unmarked tickets should not
have been counted then errors and
mistakes have been made in counting
and returning unmarked tickets for
the candidates for congress. If. the
unmarked tickets should " have been
counted then errors and mistakes have
been made in not counting the un
marked tickets and Including them in
the returns. .
"In either view it is imperative, if
the will of the people as legally ex
pressed at the polls is to be arrived at,
that a correction of these errors and
mistakes be made.
"We understand that Mr. Britt and
his advisers insist that unmarked tick
ets should not have been counted and
Included in the returns. : If that be
true, then It is necessary to correct
the returns on that account. If. on
the other hand, the unmarked tickets
should have been counted, then the un
marked tickets which were thrown
away and not counted must be includ
ed in the returns. So in any event the
oard of canvassers of Buncombe coun
ty must be presented with the facts' in
order, to declare a result in accordance
with the will of the people as legally
expressed: at the' polls. ;f : !i
' -The facts should be found and thea
either party who feels aggrieved can
present the matter for final determina
tion to the state board of canvassers,
who have the final decision. ; : - -
"It has been intimated v that " it was
the purpose of Mr. Weaver, or some of
his friends, to arbitrarily and without
reason throw out certain votes and in
this way . bring about the election of,
Mr. Weaver. No such purpose or in
tent has at any time been entertained.
"There are persistent rumors that at
certain precincts in Buncombe county
gross; f raudsj bribery and . corruption
were practiced on behalf of some of
the candidates at the election If such
frauds, bribery and corruption are dis
covered then, of course, something
must be done to purify the ballot box."

To the Editor of the Hustler:
We would be glad to know who -is
responsible for the rebuilding of the
two bridges that were washed away
between Mills ? River and Henderson
vifle on-July 16, :9T6. The crowing 'at
the por house Is not only dangerous
to autos but also to teams. We pay a
heavy road and bridge tax and we
think it is due the public t they

Henderson county people gathered '

gave vent to their feelings of elation
over the election of President Wilson, . '
and for hours the intense joy went un
confined. Noise of every conceivable
kind was made by auto horns, sirens,
tin horns, cannon crackers, tin pans -and
most everything else that would V
make a noise. A - big torchlight pa

airs, wended its w"ay over the cityT

At 11 o'clock last Thursday night the
definite news came that Wilson ha4
carried California,, one of the doubtful
states on which the 'outcome of the
election depended. The thirteen elec-x
toral votes of California gave Wilson a 7
majority in the electoral college and
were sufficient for his re-election. The
final count of the ballots in California
gave him a lead over Hughes of ovr .
3.000 in the . popular vote.
In New Mexico, New Hampshire and
North Dakota, the president also nosed
out ahead, Hughes carrying Minnesota
and West Virginia, the other doubtful
states, by a small margin.
