Railroads Seek to Prevent
Government From Putting
Adamson Bill Into Effect.
RAILWAY PRESIDENTS
SAY MEANING VAGUE
Chairman Lee, of Executives,
Says Roads Will Faithfully
Obey Instructions of Courts
If Cases Are Dismissed.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Nov. 15. Suits filed
by railroads against the federal gov
ernment to test the constitutionality
of the Adamson eight hour law alBO
are expected to result in the interpre
tation of the statute if it be upheld,
the railroad managers comprising the
national conference committee of
railways announced in a statement
here tonight.
Suits designed to test the validity
of the law and to restrain the govern
ment from putting it into effect were
filed in this city today by the New
York Central and Erie Railroads.
Other Suits Planned
Similar suits are to be brought
within the next few days by each rail
road in the country in each of the
federal districts it traverses, accord
ing to Elisha L. Lee, chairman of the
committee. Mr. Lee issued a state
ment at the end of the committee's
three day session, explaining the
railroads' program in their fighi
against the law. The statement fol
lows: "Two questions are involved in the
appeal by the railroads to the courts
for light on the Adamson law:
"1 Is the law constitutional?
"2 If it is, what does it mean?
"Opinions have been expressed by
eminent authorities that the law is
unconstitutional and - there are con
flicting opinions as to how the law, if
constitutional, should be applied.
Suits Matter of Duty
"Therefore, the railroads must, as
a matter of duty, ask the courts if the
law is within the power of congress.
"If the law is declared constitution
al, it is expected that the courts will
make clear its meaning, and the rail
ways, it is unnecessary to say, will
faithfully follow the instructions of
the courts.
"The railways have chosen what
seems to be the shortest and most
practical method of reaching an early
decision, and. in the meantime, avoid
ing a multiplicity of prosecutions and
suits.
"The railroads earnestly desire to
take the right road and it is for this
reason that they have asked the
courts for light to show them the
road."

(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Nov. 15. The matter of
the destruction of British shipping by
German submarines came up in the
House of Lords this afternoon. Baron
Sydenham invited the right to make a
declaration in the nature of a "ton
for ton" policy in behalf of Great
Britain and her allies as a reply to
"the monstrous procededings" of the
German submarines. He declares that
there was an uneasy feeling in the
country that the submarine menace
was more serious than the authorities
were wjlling to admit.
Admiral Lord Bores ford said that
Great Britain had arrived at a time
for plain speaking, because the House
of Commons and the upper house had
been muzzled by the most autocratic
government since the time of Pharoab
"Had the blockade been properly
enforced from the first," he asserted,
"we should not have been faced by
tbla submarine menace."

DEMINO, N. M. Nov. 15 The fourth
separate brigade, which left here on
a practice march culminating in man
euvers at Fort Bayard, ! badly (Ms
organized as the result of the extreme
cold to which the men have been sub
jected and on account of sickness and
desertions, according to reports re
ceived bere tonight from Fort Bay
ard. The death from spinal meningitis of
Corporal Hunt of Company I, First
Arkansas Infantry, who recently joined
his regiment after being on duty at
Batesville. Arkansas, has caused con
siderable alarm in the camp. Five
men are also dangerously ill with
pneumonia.
Deserters unable tt endure longer
the intense cold of the high altitudes
have been arriving here singly and in
squads since last night Captain John
C. Pegram, in temporary command of
Camp Demlng, during the tfbsence of
the troops, said tonight that he had
been advised of 145 desertions.
The brigade, it is learned bere, is
on its way back, cutting short the
maneuvers, and encamped tonight at
Apache Tejo, four miles frtm White
water. The remains of Corporal Hunt were
buried in the cemetery at Fort Bay
ard. Medical authorities at the base
hospital said they did not believe
there was any danger of an epidemic
of spinal meningitis.
DENIES THAT SUBSIDIES
HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED.
PETROGRAD. Nov. 15. (via Lon
don) The semiofficial Russian news
agency has issued a denial of rumors
in circulation to the effect that sub
sidies to the Polish refugees in Rus
sia have been discontinued.
The Marquic of Crewe, lord presi
dent of the council, replying for the
government, said it was useless to
make such declarations as Lord Sy-1
denham's and Beresford demanded,
without the power to enfore then.
The only voices which would speak
with Influence now were the voices of
cannon, he said.
"It is useless," said the Marquis of
Crewe, "to threaten to exact particu
lar reparations in the terms of peace
unless we are able to impose those
terms by obtaining complete victory."
The admiralty, continued the lord
president, had been singularly suc
cessful in the destruction of enemy
submarines, but the difficulties in
dealing with this menace had In
creased. The Earl of Lytton. civil lord of the
admiralty, having denied thnt the fleet
had departed from its traditional poli
cy of seeking out and destroying the
enemy, the subject was dropped.

Elimination of Factionalism

(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Nov. 15. The develop
ment of the mineral resources of the
United States was described as an or
gy of hasty exploitation by Van H.
Manning, director of the bureau of
mines, addressing the American Min
ing Congress today.
"Great as has been the advance in
the mining industry," he said, "it is
deplorable to have to say that It has
been carried on in a most wasteful
manner and with little regard for the
safety of the men who labor in the
mines.
"Had our mineral resources been
wisely develo'ped. they would have
lasted many years longer and yielded
ten times as much wealth.
"The chief need of the United
States, if it would meet new condi
tions of trade. Is a deeper and wider
cooperation among our industries and
the elin.ination of factionalism and
sentimentalism."

THE HAGUE, via London. Nov.
15. By unanimous vote parlia

80 of the constitution so that
henceforth there will be univer

The sex disability of women

The actual granting of the vote
to women, however. Is still dis
tant as it depends on the passage
of an electoral bill, which at
present is unlikely.
Early in the present year Pre
mier Cort Vander Linden, of the
Netherlands, introduced a bill in
parliament under the provisions
of which the constitutional obsta

to vote would be removed. The

WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IN

British chaplain.' while searching the
battle field of the Ancre for wounded
hidden in the shell craters during the
British advance, accompanied by a
few soldiers, came upon an isolated
trench containing nearly 400 Germans
who promptly surrendered.
The chaplain ordered the men to
file out upon the open ground, pre
paratory to passing them back with
an escort, when the German officer,
seeing the small size of the force to
which he was surrendering, tried to
rally his men and overpower it. He
was able to kill the chaplain when a
British infantryman shot hira dead,
whereupon the other Germans again
held up their hands and shouted their
eagerness to be made prisoners.
Except forlocal ineffective bombing
attacks from the direction of the
Somme river, the Germans made no
effort to retake their lost ground on
Mount Ham el region today (Wednes
day). The British are proceeding with the
occupation of the German trenches..
Prisoners aggregating a battalion was

Unless new and unexpected opposition

American joint commission believed
tonight, an agreement covering the
withdrawal of the American punitive

) trol will be ready by the end of the

The altered attitude of the Mexicans
' was shown by the' announcement at
the second session today, although it
was not attended by Luis Cabrera,
chairman of the Mexican commission,
who did not return from Philadelphia
until late today. He was accompanied
here by Ambassador-designate Arre
dondo and Mrs. Arredondo. No signifi
cance seemed to be attached to the
campaign of the Carranza troops
against Villa.
Cabrera It Silent.
Although Mr. Cabrera has nM been
here since he manifested bis opposi

Monday by bis colleagues, it is known
the other Mexicans were In telephonic
communication with him today. It is
not believed, however, that the unex

Mr. Cabrera, it now is known, has

There appeared reason to believe that
he had suggested a counter plan but
that his associates chose to continue

Mr. Bonillas denied tonight that

Minor points are yet to be considered
