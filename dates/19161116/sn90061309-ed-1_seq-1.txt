We invite personal consideration of this statement.
We opened (or business January 10th 1914. We are therefore
not the oldest bank in Monroe City.
With a new bank, age and prestige cannot be taken into the
account. The one comes in process of time, the other by good
service.
From the outset we had unbounded confidence in the outcome,
in a growing bigger, better Monroe City, its homes, its streets,
parks, and banks with increasing resources.
In Watching us Grow, it is especially interesting to note that
the spirit of GROWTH and enlargement is now a community as
set The same spirit is touching tensely our agricultural interests.
The dry and lean years have aroused our fanners to a keen
sense of their opportunities.
Our financial position is strong, capable and enthusiastic.
