A MURDER AT WELDON
W. H. Carlan and Son Agil Charged
with Killing Lawrence Coffey
at Weldon last Thursday.
Another murder was added the
past week to the long list of murders
which have occurred in Decatur coun
ty. and W. H. Carlan and son Agil,
of Weldon, are under arrest charged
with the murder of Lawrence Coffey,
a young man residing at Weldon.
Last Thursday evening Lawrence
Coffey, a young man about 21 years
of age, had been drinking some and
went into the restaurant and barber
shop owned by the Carlans about
9:30 o'clock, lie made some re
marks to Agil Carlan, who jumped
over the counter and struck Coffey
several times, knocking him to the
floor, and then took hold of Coffey's
feet and was dragging him out the
door when his father, W. H. Carlan
grabbed up a bottle, claimed to be
either a pop bottle or a tonic bottle
from his barber-shelf and rushed up
to Coffey and struck him over the
head with the bottle. The blow was
a hard one the bottle being broken
and Coffey was rendered unconscious.
It is claimed that W. H. Carlan af
ter striking Coffey said to his son,
"When you start to do a job you
want to do it right," or something to
.that effect. Young Coffey was taken
to Dr. Jamieson's office and given
medical attention. He died Friday
afternoon about 3 o'clock, and a post
mortem examination revealed that
his skull had been fractured and
some of the arteries of the brain rup
tured.
County attorney Geo. W. Baker
and sheriff Lorey went to Weldon
Friday, and the county attorney filed
an information against both of the
Carlans before justice L. G. Jamie
son,
charging them with murder. At
the preliminary examination the
state introduced evidence showing
their case and the Carlans waived
examination and were bound over to
the grand jury tinder bonds, that of
W. H. Carlan being fixed at $5,000,
and that of Agil Carlan at $3,000. In
default of giving bonds sheriff Lorey
brought them to Leon and they were
placed in jail. *Agil Carlan gave
bond Tuesday evening and was re
leased from custody, but W. H. Car
lan has not as yet been able to give
bonds.

YOU SHOULD WORRY, WOODROW!
WILSON IS THE WINNER
He Carried California*, New Mexico
and New Hampshire While Min
nesota goes for Hughes.
Woodrow Wilson has been elected
president beyond any question, and
his election has been conceded by
most republicans. As announced by
The Reporter last Thursday After
noon, Wilson carried California by
a majority of from 4,000 to 5,000.
He also carried New Hampshire by a
small plurality and New Mexico by
several thousand, while Hughes has
apparently carried Minesota by two
or three hundred, the final outcome
depending- on the soldier vote,- but
the state will probably go to Hughes.
This will give Wilson 276 electoral
votes and Hughes 255, a majority
for Wilson of 21. There are 531
electoral votes, it being necessary to
have 266 to be elected. There was
some talk that California's electoral
vote would be divided, but latest re
turns show that it will be solid for
Wilson.
