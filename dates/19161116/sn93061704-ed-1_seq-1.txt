Government Bulletin Explains New Law Re-
gardi
ling Farm Loans
The Federal Farm Loan Act provides
a way of getting mortgage loans for
farmers at low rates of interest, at
lengths of time to suit the borrower,
and on easy terms of repayment. All
farmers have to do is to form them
selves into national farm loan associa
tions. The Government will do its part
in helping them. Farmers can easily
form loan associations as prescribed by
the new law.
Ten farmers may unite to form a
national farm loan association. That
is the least number the law allows, and
farmers only can be membeis. If more
than 10 get together for this purpose, j 1 e articles of association, and the re
so much the better. But if only 10 pjit of the loan committee, an affidavit
farmers are willing to join.an organiza- must be made out and sent to the Fed
tion to borrow on farm mortgage, that , eral land bank. This affidavit must be
number satisfies the law.
Now, these 10 or more farmers in a
community call a meeting. It may be
held in a schoolhouse, a hall, a church,
or in one of their houses most conveni
ent for them all.
When the farmers have come to
gether, they discuss the subject infor
mally and decide to form themselves
into an association to borrow money on
mortgage. They appoint a commitu-e
to draw up articles of association. These
articles should set forth, the object of
the association and the territory within
which it proposes to do business. They
may follow a prescribed form furnished
by the land bank, or they may be mod
ified to suit the needs of apy particular
body of farmers But nothing can be
included in the articles of association
that is contrary to the letter and spiiit
of the law.
The farmers who thus unite them
selves into a national farm loan asso
ciation then sign the articles.' A copy
pf them is made to be sent to the Fed
eral land bank of the district within
which the association is situated. When
the articles of association are received
by the land bank they are filed for
further reference.
A loan committee of three members
must be appointed to pass on loans. A
written report- is drawn up by them
after they have examined the lands.
The commjtee examines the farms and
farm lands for the purpose of apprais
jng thejr value. The report of this
loan committee, signed by all , three
members, must be sent to the land
b ink with the articles of association.
All three members must sign the re
port or it "will be worthless. "The land
bank will, not consider the request for
ioan's unless all three members sign
Iheir I report about the value f th
f urns. Their report should state dis
t'netly that the said committee had ex
amined thé 4ands 'and, '.appraised their
tralues. The lands and farmí should be
d.'scribed, and the'vaiue of those up. n
which the members desire loans should
) staec.
It is very important that the loan.
c immlttee put a ust valuation on the
lands. Care should be taken not to put
the valuation too, high nor too lovy. The
former would be rejected by the land
btnk; the latter might prevent, the
firmer from getting as high a loan on
jiis farm as he wanted.
Loan committee should remember
piat thejr appraisement is only pre
liminary; jt is pot binding on the F.ejU
eral land bank of their district. Fon
líteron the land bank will send its own
appraiser to fix his values on the same
farms. It would be ajne thing for
the members of the association if the
t vo independent, appraisements of the
lime farms should come close together,
i or
FARM
ASSOCIATION
It would prove to the officers of the
land bank that they were dealing with
an upright, intelligent body of farmers.
That would be a moral and intellectual
credit to the community. It certainly
would help their financial credit. So
loan committees should be fair at the
btgir.ning. Let them fix just values
o the farms of those members who
are asking for loans.
The report of the loan committee
should also give any other information
which would help the land bank to un
d rstand conditions in that community.
With the list of proposed members,
signed and acknowledged by the rrwm
bers. It must also be signed and ac
knowledged by the secretary-treasn: er,
whose residence and post-office address
must also be stated on the affidavit.
This affidavit, thus signed and acknowl
edged by the members and the secretary-treasurer,
should set forth that
each subscriber is the owner of í -m
land, or is about to become the owner
of a farm. That is; a person in rt e
community may net be in actual p.
session of a farm, but expects to be in
a shoi t time, by pinchase, the ownci
of the particular far;n described, in )v.s
application; in that case he could legal - j
ly join the association and become a
member. The affidavit should ah,o
state that. the desired loans added to
gether amount to $20,000 or more.
The national farm loan associations
are to be organized and run by farmers
and for farmers. Persons not farmers
need not apply for membership; they
could not legally be admitted. For the
law says that no one except farmers
shall be members, and no one except
mi mbers can borrow. The lowest sum
any farmer can borrow is $100; the
highest is $10,000. These are the limits
fixed by law
The associations will grow by the ad
mission of new members. After the
affidavit showing that the loans amount
to $20,000 or more, has been sent to the
land banK and the farm loan association
has become a corporate body through a
charter being granted to it by the Fed
eral Loan Board, a farmer who wants
t borrow $100 only can be admitted to
membership. In fact, there is no limit
to the growth of the association after
the first ten or moie have Ibecome a
chartered association. Any farmer may
be admitted to membership who wants
1 1 borrow on farm mortgage .'any um
r.nging l'rom $100 to $10,000. n this
way the national farm loan associations
will grow in numbers.
But farmers cannot join without buy
ing shares' in their association.. The
yalue of the shares js fixod. at the low
price of $5 each. Every farmer who
b comes a member of a national farm
ban association also becomes a bor-rjv.-er
and a shareholder at the same
time. For the law says that he must
subscribe for stock to the amount of 5
pir'cent of his desired loan. If he his farm and desires. borrón .for liw
wants to borrow $100, he must take h proviug.i.t I irj anyof the ways jnentioji
share of stock; if $200, 2 shares; if ed above, he can borrow money fron
$1,00Q, 10 shares; and if $10,000, IQOi
i: ----- '- A
aiare.
The borrower may pay in case forhisi
s;ock at the time he applies for msm
b
r.lnp, or he may wait until Ins loan-
j ícieived and then pay for his stock:
f,on the loan. He may, if he wishes;'
' eVl.n iUd the cost of his stock 'to the
; am )Unt 0f his loan, providing this cots :
j n3t increase his loan above 60 per cent",
I
it; iiii'.iseu
viT!aeof the land and
20 per ccrof the permanent improve
ments thereon, . Bat the owner ' must
keep the biddings insured.
Each farmer is liable for the debts of
his association to twice the par value
of the stock he owns. One-half ci this
liability has already been paid as repre
sented by his shares of stock hefd by
the association. So that, in case of the
failuie of an association, a member who
held one share would be liable for only
$5 more. Thus. theWmbers take little
risk and reap all the benefits of co
operative mortgage credit.
The money the farmers pay their as
sociation for stock is turned over to the
Federal land bank to buy stock in that
bank for the association. The cash may
or may not be sent in with the sublcrip
tion for stock. If cash is sent, the
secretary-treasurer of the associatio.il
must procure it from the prospective
borrowers. Each farmer pays his share
according to the amount of his loan.
For example, if one member, wants to
borrow $5)0 and another wants to bor
row $1,000, the first one has to pay $25
and the second one $50. The subscrip
tion price of $1,000 for the láhü-bank
stock is provided'in-thifl-way.
If for any reason? ' however, any or
all of the, loans should. nobe granted
by the land tbknk, . the morfejr j.p4fd 'n
advance on account of stock subscrip
tions would be Vefunded. Buf the cash
need not be. sent in advance .with the
subscription made by the -secretory-treasurer.
When the loans aregranted
by the land bank, the amount '"of the
subscription to the stock may be de
ducted from the total amount cf the
loans. In such case the balance is for
warded to the secretary-treasurer of
the association.
Now, Ic-t the farmer members under
stand this, that the associations and
not thr are tho owners of the stock in
the LVe.al l.md bank, and this plan is
'. i'aiit the ar sociations $iay ulti

! la, .d' hanks, This stock is held

and though t!i- we cooperative organiza
tions provide.- the method whereby they
ultimately btcoms the exclusive pwn
ers,
When the application for the charter
is sent to the land bank, it" must ' state
that a temporary organization has been
fomied. This temporary organization
elects a board of directors, a loan com
mittee, and a secretary-treasurea. Thé
board oi directors must consist of not
less than five members; the loan com
mittee must consist of three members
Ths bpa.d cf directors elects a presi
dent, vice president, 'loan . committee,
and secretary-treasurer. The last
named office-r.need not be a member of
the association or resident of the dis
trict, but the others must be members
and residents. The secretary-treasure
receives a small salary, which is fixed.
by the board of directors. All othef
officers are supposed to ':serve without
pay, unless the payment of salaries is
ápproved by the Federal Farm Loaji

The loans are made on first mortga
ges on farm lands. The mortgages
may run not less than 5 years nor more
than 40 years. The borrower himself
decides the length of time his loan shall
run. The interest can not exceed 6 per
cent and may be lower. Every six
months, or once each year, the farmer
pays the installment on his debt. This
includes interest, part of the debt itself,
and a small amount to cover expenses
of the association. The secretary-treasurer
makes the collections, gives his
receipt for them, and sends the money
collected to the Federal land bank.
Thus most of the work of the associa
tions is done by this officer. That is
why he is allowed a small salary.
The Federal land bank which receives
the application for loans and other pa
pers from the association then sends an
appraiser to examine the land and the
financial condition of the proposed bor
rowers, if these conditions are found
satisfactory, the land bank forwards
the papers to the Federal Farm Loan
Board with their recommendation. On
approval by the Federal Farm Loan
Board, a charter is granted to the ap
plicants to do business in their district,
the. charter being forwarded to the as-
rjciation.by the Federal land bank.
fWhen the charter has been granted,
tile association can borrow money of
the land bank. The mortgages are then
prepared and delivered to the-" secretary
treasurer, who forwards them to the.
Federal land bank of the district. On
its part, the land bank sends the money
for the loans to the secretary-treasurer
of the association. He in turn delivers
the proper amount of money to the re
spective borrowers and' the farm mort
gages transaction is closed. The farmer
has thus been enabled to borrow money
on first mortgages with practically no
trouble or expense on h3 part.
In this way the farmers themselves
become the owners and directors of the
national farm loan associations. They
become investors as well as borrowers.
T ie Government has not only made the
Way easy, but it helps the farmers to
reap the benefits of the profits derived
f rom their own united efforts of bor-
r wing.
But more than this. By becoming
subscribers to the capital stock of the
Federation land bank of their district,
with the associations have to do when
applications for loans are made, the
f aimer members of the national farm
ban associations will ultimately become
the owners of the land banks also, for
the Government will gradually with
draw its stock holdings from the Fed
eral land banks and leave their"' owner
ship with all their profifs entirely in the
hinds of the farmers themselves.
Let it be plainly understood that
farmers can form their preliminary or
ganizations at once. They can have
their directors chosen, as well as their
president, vice president, loan commit
tee, and secretary-treasurer. But they
"can not receive their charter, nor can
they borrow money of the lard banks
until these have been . located and or
ganized. This may take several months.
But, if the farmers have all the pre
liminary work done nhead, they can
m.ake their applications to the land
bank-, as soon as it is organized. This
will help them to get their loan? quicker
than if they put off oianizlng until the
land banks are located. Let 10 or more
farmers in every community go altead
at once and form a temporary organi
zation. It will help them and it will
facilitate the work of organization.

WILSON WINS BY
POPULAR MAJORITY
OF ABOUT A MILLION
Latest returns obtainable on the
recent election indicate that Wilson has
been re-elected, having received a mil
lion more popular votes than did Hughes
When bulletins showed New York, Illi
nois and Indiana in the Hughea column,
reports went forth that Hughes was
elected wtihout a doubt,' as it was not
thought possibly that a president could
be chosen witho'ut .the electoral vote of
these states. But with thirty states
falling in line for Wiison, there were
only seventeen left for Hughes. In
several states the election was so close
that practically every precinct report
was necessary to, tell which way the
electoral vote would go. California,
New Hampshire, Minnesota and New
Mexico were the last to report.
In the state, De Baca has the best of
it over Bursum, while Lindsey has de
feated McDonald. The final count may
change the present figures, as regards
the state officers, but appearently the
democratis have elected a majority of
their candidates. Roberts has been re
turned to the supreme bench, Ervien
retains his place as land commissioner,
andWagner will be superintendent of
public instruction, and Sargent will
continue to hold 'down the job of audi
tor. In the case of some of these, the
majorities are so small, that it is possi
ble that the official count to be made
next week, may change the result, but
this is hardly probable.
In the county, complete returns have
been very slow in coming in. It has
been conceded that the entire republi
can ticket is elected, but we have not
as yet been able to secure figures as to
majorities.
Seven More Cars of Beans
Seven more cars' of beans were billed
out during the past week by the local
Santa Fe agent, making a total of fifty
seven to date. Several more are load

ments will continue for several weeks
more. The threshers are still busy and
will be for a month or more.

H. B. Scott Died at Gallop
Prof. H. B. Scott ' principal 6f the
Gibson school, died at Gallup on Mon
day of last week. He had been com
pelled to give up his work in the school
room on Thursday, but thought a day
or two of rest would restore him to
usual health. He took to his bed, suf.
fering intensely. Early Monday morn
ing, death came to-, his relief. The
funeral was held in Gallup, interment
being in a local cemetery.
Mr. Scott had been principal of the
Mountainair school a year ago, having
gone to Gibson last autumn. His work,
there is reported as quite satisfactory,
he having taken a deep interest in. the
school. He had made numerous friends
who mourn his demise.
