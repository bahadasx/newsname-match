STATE SUNDAY
SCHOOL MEET
Noted Gathering In Session in Mex
ico Thin Week Workers Here
From All Tarts of The Country.
The FJfty-ftirst Annual Meeting of
Missouri Sunday School Convention
is in session in Mexico this week.
At the opening Dr. F. D. Kershner
of St, Louis gave a talk on "How We
Got New Testament Sources." Ex
plaining how the books of the New
Testament came to be written the
source of the material. The first of
the New Testament books were writ
ten 48 A. D. See first Thessalonian
letter. Books written on papyrus,
which was in long rolls, or parch
ment, which was made into books.
In existence today are four manu
scripts of New Testament that date
back to 300 or 400 the oldest being
written 325 A.'D.
We know these references are cor
rect because numerous references in
older writings. There is stronger
proof of the authenticity of the Bible
than of any other book. The oldest
manuscript of Cicero, for instance,
is 9G0 A. I).
Marion Lawrence of Chicago made
a great talk Tuesday afternoon on
"Service." That is the keynote of
the convention, based on the text,
"Not to be1 ministered unto, but to
minister." In his talk he told the del
egates how to' get the most out of
the convention, that they may render
the greatest good to their churches
and Sunday schools when they return
home.
There is somebody, or thing, to be
served. A purpose for serving, and
force or power driving to service.
First, a purpose to serve our own
Sunday school, onr county, our State,
the world. Second, motive pleas
ing to God. Serving we serve God
thru the machinery the real objec
tive the one to be served is God.
Third, the dynamic, or force, that
leads to the service Is dod. The
measure of God's love is "SO". "God
SO loved the world that He gave His
only Son." The motive will change
drudgery to pleasure. Quotation
from Livingston: "Willing to go
anywhere, so It was forward."
E. Morris Ferguson spoke on the
"Graded Lesson." Some have troub
le with the graded lesson because
they approach it from the old Ideal
of education. Old education starts
with truth and seeks to bring it to
the child because it is valuable in it
Belf. The new vision starts on the
mind and heart of the pupil, and then
finds the thing he- needs. The new
lessons aim that at the end of each
year the child has developed certain
attributes of character rather than
a fund of information.
The convention closes today. It is
one of the best things of its kind ever
held in our city. Large delegations
'have been here from Jackson and
Ray counties, especially, the latter
all coming in a special car.
THE CI TV COUNCIL.
At the City Council meeting Mon
day night a resolution was introduc
ed providing for the paving of Jeffer
son street railroad crossing. The
railroads are also to be required to
install gates at the crossing.
Attorney David H. Robertson ap
peared before the Council in behalf
of W. J. Mason and others demand
ing the abatement of the nuisance
caused by the city sewers emptying
into Beaver Dam Creek northeast of
town. A septic tank must be built.
The Council at its next meeting is
to take up the matter of selling the
'A. P. Green Fire Brick Co. addition
al city lands.
Bills for $1,601.52 were allowed.
Makes a Fellow "Hot"
To get up in the cold and start a fire
in the heating, stove. The Estate
stove will not go out. Also a line of
$5.00, $7.50 and $10.00 Oaks.

The Message live stock market
report from St. Louis is worth while
this week.' Notice where an Audrain
firm gets the biggest price for cattle,
$11.50, in the history of the Nation,
al Stock Yards.
According to the Paris Appeal $60
was the price Moss Crow, near Vic
tor, received for a spring calf Sat
urday. He sold it to Roy Key. Crow
bot It two weeks ago from John Haw
kins for $47.50. It was a Shorthorn
and would weigh close to 800
pounds.
C. il. Crockett tells The Message
that he sowed a crop of soudan grass
last spring and harvested two fine
crops from it. It makes an excellent
feed. He thinks it will eventually
take the place of timothy in this lo
cality. He will sow a larger crop
next season.
Among the good steers on qhe
market today was a drove marketed
by E. B. Johnson, of Audrain county,
Mo., says the Live Stock Reuorter.
There were 15 head in this strine that
averaged 1,349 lbs. and sold lor $10.-
75. Johnson conditioned the steers
personally and the beeves displayed
their usual good handling. In the
hands of Mr. Johnson a drove of cat
tle are Insured the very best of treat
ment. Mr. Johnson expressed his
pleasure over the sale today.
If you are- a chronic stayer-at-home
you Are in a prison. You are enslaved.
People who thus enslave themselves
become narrower, lose interest
and enthusiasm, and get nowhere.
They get somewhere who go some
where. Farmers and stockmen who
travel some, and keop in touch wit a
what is going on in the big field oT ag
riculture and animal husbandry, live
in better homes, have better farms,
better buildings, more friends, are
more interesting to meet, and get
more out of life than those who shut
themselves in, and refuse to extend
their sympathies and presenco into
the life of their time. Men owe it
to themselves and their families oc
casionally to break out of the litrle
world In which they live, and estab
lish contact with the deeper and
broader current of life that flows in
big events and big centers. For most
farm people in this region there Is no
trip that is offering so many advant
ages and opportunities as a trip to
the International Live Stock Exposi
tion at Chicago, which will be bold
this year from December 2nd to 9th.
This gigantic exposition comes at a
time when the field work is done,
when everybody Is more sociable and
communicative than at any other sea son
and when people get together
in the fireside spirit. Anyone who
sees this magnificent show of live
stock, which represents perfection in
form and quality, is broadened and
inspired; Ills vision Is enlarged; lie Is
a better and bigger man; his inter
ests are vivified and increased; he
goes home with new energies and re
solves, and he is freed from a person
al prison. The supreme event of the
year In American agriculture Is the ,
"International American agricultural
Show" in Chicago, wJiich is the
year bigger and better than ever, and
which it will be worth traveling
many miles to see. It is the man
who gets out of his shell and sees
what the world Is doing and hears
what it is saying who does things at
home. '
Raps and knocks of failure will
help bring success to the man who
keeps trying. See article by Thomas
E. Wilson on another page of the
Message.
