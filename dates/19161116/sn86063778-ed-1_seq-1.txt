Safe Lead.?Wilson is a majority
President.
New York.?On the returns up to
date President Wilson has received
8,608,085 votes and Mr. Hughes 8,090,951.
Mr. Wilson's popular plurality
Is therefore 417,134. He is a majority
president, which he was not when he
went into office. In 1912 ho received
6,293,419 votoe.
It has been said that Mr. Hughes re
ceived the votes of the most populous
states of the Union and Mr. Wilson
** that of the less populou. There is not
so mucch difference as might be expected.
The states which voted for
Mr. Hughes had. according to the last
census, 45,901,739 inhabitants. Those
which voted for Mr. Wilson had 45,737.643.
The difference in Mr. Hughes'
favor is 164.096.
The latest returns from the close
states show the following results:
In California Wilson is leading by
3.431 votes, with a few scattering precincts
missing; in Minnesota, where
i?ome of the militiamen's votes have
been counted. Hughes is still ahead
by 286 votes with 27 districts missing;
In North Dakota, with 14 districts miss
ing. wnson leans ny iid.i voies; new
Hampshire, where the count has been
completed. Rives Wilson a plurality of
63 votes.
From the reports of leading correspondents
In the different states on
tho influences which brought about
Mr. Wilson's election it is possible to
get a clear idea of the part played by
the different group "votes" of which
so much was said before election, and
of the reasons whjich moved great
bodies of voters to the decision they
reached.
Progressives and the WomenTwo
classes of voters, and two only,
accomplished the result. They were
not *he Gerrman-Americans. the labor
vote, or any of the groups standing for
special interests. They were the Progressives
and the women.
The split made in tho Republican
partv in 1910, which became a break
in 1912, was not mended at Chicago.
The dispatches now in the hands of
the papers indicate no probability of
Its being mended until the cause for
It Is taken away. From the Hudson
River to the Mississippi. the bolters
of 1912 were largely satisfied with
Hughes, but to the Fast and West of
those boundaries, especially to the
West, they were nod. And It was the
West that decided the election.
In New York nnd Illinois the breach
was apparently healed; there Is no
sign of anything to the contrary, and
the same thing seems true of the
w.'ates that generally follow the leadership
of these two. That, however,
waa as far as Colonel Roosevelt was
able to bring about a reunion.
The Progressives of Kansas. Washington.
California axid the other Western
States have again defeated a Recause
the other wing of the party was
in control ami made the nomination.
I Minnesota and Wisconsin voted for
Hughes, but both have show that they
are as progressive as ever. Minnesota
by accepting: him so narrowly and
Wisconsin hv I^aFollette's victory.
The woman vote and the Progresalve
vote telescope each other, for in
the critical states the women who
turned the election were largely Progressives.
But the women voteo as
women, too. The reports from the
states where women vote show that
the dream of solidifying: woman as a
sex and swinging her vote this way
a"d that at tho order of female j>olitlcal
leaders is shattered forever. But
the women did make un their minds
as women In many Western tSates
and voted without r^eard either tc
how the women politicians bade t'nem
or to how their own men folks voted I

said that he would make no ronees

It was explained that this meant
when the secretary of state in each of ' '
the doubtful states had certified to the

started in California Monday, it does
not start in North .Dakota until Nov.
17. This will take from a week to ten

Wlllcox was asked for an estimate of ' '
the time to elapse before the Republican
leaders would decide who had ' 1
been elected president, he said he
would make no estimate. He did say
that ho regardil ten days as a "safe

Washington.?Danger of a nationIde
railroad strike, which was be;ved
to liave been averted by the
issage of the Adaiusou eight-hour
w. has not entirely disappeared, it
tveloped here when representatives
the railroads and the four brother>ods,
comprising 40b.00b employes,
lied to reaeli an agreement as to the
oper application of the new law.
he stumbling block, both sides ail
itted, was the existing mileagi sysm
of compensation.
The announcement of the latest
?adlock between the railroads and
leir employes catne at the conelusti
of an all-day conference between
le national conference committee
' the railways and the brotherhood
liefs. which hud been arranged in

William CJ. Lee. president of the

bsence of A. B. Garretson, of the
rder of Railway Conductors, deelar1
in a statement that in the event
t evasion by the railroads of the
damson law, summary action would

lid that the strike order which was
irectly responsible for the law. was
till In effect and the brotherhoods
ould not hesitate to enforce it if the
ccasion warranted it.
"The brotherhoods asked for this
inference," said Mr. Lee. "At the
torning session we discussed the aplication
of the law and found that
lere was no basis upon which we
luld possibly agree. Another setack.
besides the elimination of the

,sks With Much Concern About Complexion
of Next House.
Washington.? President Wilson was
ark at his desk in the White House,
fter an absence of 2 months, preared
to take up important foreign
roblems which have been held in
beyance pending the election as well
? domestic questions. These inluded
the German submarine queson,
the Mexican problem and a numer
of Federal appointments.
The President was expected to conder
first the submarine situation
hich is admittedly serious. A sumlary
of recent developments in Gerlan
submarine warfare, prepared by
te state department, was ready to be
dd before him and. in addition, he
rrobably soon will confer again with
mbassador Gerard on the situation.
The President has not even considred
the question of chances in his
ibinet, according to Administration
Ticials, who characterize as pre^iaire
reports that lie had decided on
ich changes. It is possible, howtor,
that one or two cabinet officers
