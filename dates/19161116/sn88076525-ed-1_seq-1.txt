The greatest" pure seed shoow that
has ever been put on in the North
west is just now closing in this city.
There were hundreds of samples of
the finest kind of grain, corn and po
tatoes, as well as many vegetables.
It was really a revelation to those who
attended the fair to see this display.
iThat this show will result in
good to the^farmers of the state and
more especially to-the Lake Begion
goes without saying.
KICKED FlIlS
Park Biver, N. D., Nov. 15.—An
dihew Lofgren, a farmer living be
tween Adams and Fairdale, was kick
ed in the forehead by a horse he was
driving and died as a result. Lofgren
attempted to unhitch the horse, when,
without warning, the animal raised"
its foot and struck him a severe blow,
inflicting a horrible wound and Lof
gren fell unconscious.
His son MW the aeddent asd im
mediataly yushed him to Adams, wiieVe
it was decided to take him to Grand
Folks for treatment^ but the man died
before the trip was started^
Last' Saturday a large number of
farmers of the Edmore country got
together and organized the Farmers
Mutual Fire Insurance Company of
Bamsey County. This company will
write a line of insurance on farm' pro
perty and will confine their operations
entirely to Bamsey county for the
[present at least. Mutual fire insur
ance companies for the farmers hav»
been a success in this and other states
and there is no reason why this new
company will not be a success if the*
matter is handled right from the be
ginning.
For the first real attempt tiie stock
show at the Harvest festival which
closing today in this city, was vejry
good. The stock auaers in this vicin

you might go to many county fairs
and not see a better exhibit than was
here this week. This was really onl/
a start, and we hope will become
permanent thing each year. As a mat
of fact we should have a county fair
andwe can have one if tiie proper In*

World will be tiie first.one among
twenty-ftve to put up rflQO toward the

And with fti* amqant^Mi a mMjteus
to start with, we believe that we could
establish and maintain a fair each
year, and if the thing is properly
handled we would be able to get an
appropriation from the county each
year to help maintain it.
