To Be Constitutional
The supreme court today (Mon
day) declared enough of the initin
tive I'arm loan law, passed in 1914,
is colstitutional to afrord "a co.n
plet0, workable statute." The de
tails of the operation of this statute

'Associate Justice WVilliam L. Hol

title .,it-lice Sidney Sanner and
(hief Justic-e Theodore Brantley con
car, the latter stating: "While I did
not hear the argument in this case.
I have examined carefully the provis
ions of the statute and the sections
of the constitution by which its val
idity must be determined. I am sat
iffied that Mr. Justice Holloway has
stated the only conclusion permiss
able and therefore concur therein."
The following -paragraphs sum
marize the decision:
"Our conclusion is that the board
after having given preference to the
public securities enumerated, in the
inv est,.ent of the public school

employ the residue of those funds
and all the pernianent funds belong.

"This constructionl harmonizes
section 1 of this act with section 3,
article \'I of the constitution, and
leaves intact a complete workiable
stlatute, -ilmsolved from any of the ob
ject.ion. lodgedl againsl this plan."
The decision oafl-eCts threoe classes

the higher educational funds, and
those derived front the grants to the
reform school, tihe tesa!'- anid duilmb

Secti n ::, article XI, declares, con

that it shall be invested, "so far as

''lthe (-,o rt holds that the restric

form i'1an act are validl, and that
Iiereal't i'. il oney fronm the three
funds can be invested only in bonds

thIl county l'r the 18 reported and it
ih believed thai when the complete
o•ld olfficial ret ulrns have been re
ceived from the.ts same 18, counties
the majority for prohibition will be
in excess of 10,0t)0. At that rate,
the final majtt rity, if the other coun.
ties maintain the average, ought to
be nearly 20,000 votes.
That the total majority reportedi
from the other counties will far out
strip the vote already reported is
evident from the fact that in the to
tal here presented, the figures for
Silver Bow, Deer Lodge and Lewis
and Clark counties are included and
they are the only ones, so far re
ported, that have given majorities
againstt prohibition. In other words,
the majorities voting dry, of the 18
already reported, total more than
1 3,500 while the majorities of Silver
Bow, Deer Lodge and Lewis and
'lark against prohibition, total
about 4,500, thus leaving a majority
in favor of the dry in the counties
reported at 9030, as stated. Taking
the 15 counties voting dry, the av
* ra'e majority is fountd to be 900
oles. If that average is maintainied
;or the 2 '3 counties yet to le hard
0'0oni, then the actual lta jority for
iroohibition in the 23 counties should
it 207000 votes, which, added to
ihe 9030 majority already in, would
" iake the majority for the stale a lit
it mlore tlhan 29,73:0 voles.
It is a tafe irediction, however,
'hat in the counties yet to be heard
from, the majorities will not average,
as high as those already reported.
blecause the ones yet to report are
those of the smalled voting plopula
tion. In percentages they will vote
stronger for the dry side bui the to
tal vote will not run high. In the
15 counties showing dry majorities
now reported the smallest majority
is in Prairie county, where it was but
145 and the largest in Flathead
where it was 1595. Taking six of
the dry counties, including Flathead
lihe largest with 1595; Prairie, the
smallest, with 145., and the second
largest, Yellowstone 1473; second
smallest, Beaverhead, with 300; 6th
largest, Valley, 954, and the third
smallest, Sweet Grass 357, and ac
cepting one-sixth of the total as the
average and is found to be 804 votes.
If this average obtains, then the 23
counties yet to report would show a
dry majority of 18,494. This, ad
ded to the present majority of 9000
would make a majority for prohi
bition of 27,524.
That the majority will be nearer
20,000 than 10,000 is generally con
ceeded from all sources.
