SCHOOL NOTES.
B YV. H. JOHNSON, Sup.tlntand.nt
The attendance this week is
junsiderftbly better than last

Unit cotton is about all picked.

now who are not finding much
.mtton to pick, in fact not
tMinugh it seems to justify their

in thu habit of waiting till after
Christmas to start to school
uuain, even though the cotton
crop is picked out beforehand.
Tii do this is to lose the best
pro i of the school term. Every

b. ioio Christmas or after the
holidays.

An Interesting Letter.
Below we reproduce a letter
received by the Horald this week,
and wo feel that it will be of
much interest to many old ac
quaintances of the writer:
Fredania, Kas., Nov. 12, 1916.
Editor of Hayti Herald:
The Herald reached me this
morning, a pleasant visitor: many
thanks to my old friend, Dr. F.
A. Mayes.
I have many old friends in
Southeast Missouri, where I
lived for many years, and I am
rejoiced to learn of their pros
perity, as I see from the Herald
I congratulate the people of
your Senatorial district on
the election of the Hon. Von
Mayes, who I know will be an
honor to his district. I see a
bright tuture spreading out be
fore him. He is worthy and well
qualified, and when Joe Russell
gets tired Von will take his
place. "So mote it be."
The Democratic party of our
State has much to be proud of.
The money bags that were
strewn with lavish hands among
the people were not able to over
come the votes of our mothers.
It has been a custom from time
immemorial, whereof the memory
of man runneth not to the con
trary, to "reward true merit
wherever found." Our women
saw true merit in Woodrow Wil
son and as a reward threw the
State of Kansas into the Demo
cratic ranks. Wilson county,
normally Republican by a large
majority, "went Democratic by
lour hundred majority. We are
proud of our women; give the
