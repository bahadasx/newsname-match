the expenditures.
The report further ailed attention
to the fact that the iucom- for eight
years has been decreasing steadily, that
i? no year during that period have the
receipts equaled the expenditures. The
eost of the hoard in the last ten years
has increased ad per cent, and the re
port made it plain that for the edu

pressed that the committee to which
the report will he referred mny recom
mend to the general association that
this amount he set as the minimum to
be secured for the education board
during the current year, and that It
be distributed in some equitable way
among the twenty-nine district as
sociations of the State.
The hoard also expressed the hope
that each of these district associations,

distribute the amount assigned to It

helpfully oo-operati .e. Campaigns for

of sinners and the reclamation of hack

"There has been tnue'o interest

The Sunday schools are outgrowing the
facilities provided for them, and in sev

l?een constructed. The young people's
work has been encouraging."
"Have you got any >celesiastical

I'r Simpson closed his report by stat
