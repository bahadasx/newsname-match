SNOWS AND COLD WEATHER
BENEFICIAL TO FARMERS
It had been threatening cold weath
er for some time but Sundny It com
menced to drizzle and luter to sleet.
Monday morning the temperature wns
considerable below normal and It re
mained disngiccuble most of the, day.
That night it really turned cold and
those who owned thermometers were
afraid to look ut them for fear they '
had gono so low they had broken. At
seven o'clock Tuesduy morning some
of them registered ns low ns fifteen
degrees nbovo zero. Ico was about an
inch thick nnd u slight skiff of snow
lie on the ground. It sure reminded
the inhabitants of Tucumcnri that win
ter comes onrc a year, even in sunny
New Mexico.
The side-walks were covered with Ice
nnd it was with difficulty pedestrians
went to their places of business, but
no .serious accidents have been report
ed. Some of the old-timers say this
promises to bo one of the hardest win
ters ever known in New Mexico. Bet
ter prepare as it may be so.
The farmer will renp the reward if
there is much snow as there are many
extra thousand acres of wheat sowed
on the plains because of the lucky
strike made by the farmers up there
this year. We town folks can stand
considerable cold weather if it will 1
make the farmers prosperous. The
producers arc what wo need. When
the producer is really prosperous they
usually pass it around and the mer-,
chant and everybody receives their j
share.
A few weeks ago it was suggested
that the United States would be forced
to place an embnrgo on wheat and '
other food stufTs. At first people only j
laughed at the proposition, but the
mnttcr has been taken up by the main
newspapers of the country nnd a move
Is now on foot to suggest such a mea
sure to President Wilson. Tho situa
tion is becoming alarming nnd if we
allow tho foreign countries to drain
this country of its food, what will we
do for flour before the next crop is
harvested? It would not surprise us
to hear of an embargo being placed
on wheat.
Most of the farmers have sold their
grain nnd it is now being horded away
by tho millionaires to be kept nnd sold
at exhorbitant prices. Tho consumer,
tho mnn who cams his living by the
sweat of hla brow, will pay tho bill.
Wheat is bringing $1.81 in Tucumcnri.
This grain must lie shipped to tho mill
and nuidoMntrt- flour nnd returned to
tho consumer to buy nt big prices. No
one begrudges the farmer the big price
he is now receiving for his grain but
there is something wrong somewhere.
If the war in Europe would suspend
nnd yencc would bo restored there Is
u possibility or several men who now
claim to bo milliornircs, going broke
in a night's time, but so long ns the
war continues, nnd this government
allows foreign countries to come here
and buy our food stuffs, those men will
double their millions,
Election day enme on with u whiz

POSTMASTER GORMAN DIES
AFTER SHORT ILLNESS
T. F. Gorman, postmaster, died at
his home in this city Wednesday morn
ing after a serious illness lasting only
a few days.
During the past few months Mr.
Gorman has been troubled with his
stomach, but he was being treated
for name by local physicians and was
thought by his family nnd friends to
be getting along nicely, but nbout two
weeks ngo he was taken suddenly ill
and it was necesFury for him to remain
in bed. He had several hemorrhages
from the stomach and wns thought
to be dying several times, but each
time he rallied and Tuosdoy seemed to
be much better. That night he be
came violently ill nnd passed away
about twelve o'clock.
Tho parsing of Mr. Gorman takes
another of our best citizens. Mr. Gor
man was chief clerk on the E. P. h
S. W. with headquarters here for sev
eral years. lie desired a change of
work and secured the nppointmcnt ns
postmaster, tnking up his duties Inst
May. He was attentive to his work
and was making cue of tho most effi
cient postmasters Tucumcnri ever en
joyed. He was strictly business and
a perfect gentleman.
Mr. Gorman was 38 years of age
at the time of his death. The cause
of his dentil wns said to nave- been
cancer of the stomach. There were
no funeral services held hero but the
body was prepared for shipment to
his former home at Jolict, 111., where
the interment will take plnce Satur
day, November 18.
He leaves u wife nnd one son be
sides a host of friends und relatives,
to. mourn his death, nnd the fnmily
has tho sympathy of all in this snd
bereavement.
The remains were accompanied to
Joliet by Mrs. Gorman nnd son, John,
nnd two sisters, Mrs. Crooks nnd Mrs.
Conner, of Pueblo, Colo., who were
hen.' during the last few days of Mr.
Gorman's i.ickness.

Th building is being done with
tate money that can lie used for no
other purpose but state roads and this

QUAY
CORN DINGS FARMER
$195.00 GASH PER TON
A. L. Gurley, broom corn buyer, of
Melrose, has been in the north imt
of Quay county this week receiving
broomcorn from the Quay c . .- ' . m
ers. Messrs. Harry Whilos'dc, G. A.
Brimmage, Al Dunlnp, Enii Weaver,
J. L. Clemmer und Chas. E. Ward of
Quay, were here this week and deliver
ed 40,500 pounds of the best broom
corn Mr. Gurley has eceived this year
and he paid the top price to them,
which was 5195,00 per ton. This made
two car loads and brought in the neigh
borhood of S 1,000. Not so bad for
just common dry fnrming land which
only a few years ago was considered
worthless ns far as furming wont. Mr.
Gurley said he hud bought hundreda of
tons of broom corn this year and the
product from Quay Valley was the
best he had seen,
Mr. Gurley has been buying broom
corn in all parts of the county for
several months, paying good prices for
it before it wns baled. lie has shippe'd
fourteen cars from Glcnrio, two from
Hard, two from San Jon, und about
fifty from Melrose. Twenty-five of
these cars shipped from Melrose were
raised in Quay county on the plnins.
Four cars were shipped from Tucum
cnri previous to the shipment this week
of two cars. He, like all o hor grain
buyers, would be glnd to locate in this
city if the county roads wero fixed up
so the farmers could deliver their pro
ducts to the county sent nnd not have
to hnul it down in Curry county and
sell it.
Often times the Alhuqunrnuc nnd
Santa Fe paper have articles about
the big wheat farms in Curry countv.
counting the Vance Bros., with their
hundreds of acres nnd thousands of
bushels among the prosperous Currv
county wheat growers, when every
inch of their land is located in Quuv
county, but they nre forced to haul
their wheat to Melrose because the
roads are better. They also do moat
of their banking nnd trading their.
This also is counted in Curry county
resources. The Vnncc boy:-; nro not
the only prosperous Quay county farm-
on doing business In Curry county.
It is up to Tucumcari to av.-aken and
unite in an effort to encourage the
farmers to come here with their pro
ducts, make Tucumcari their trading
point and leave their money in Quny
county banks. They have been pros
perous and surccrsful this year while
farmers north ind east have failed.
They have raised excellent wheat that
lopped the mnrkot. They have raised
broom corn thnt will top the market.
This is no experiment; it is facts, now
if n good rond is built between lieiv
und the plains success will bo mutual
und Tuucmcari will become the beet
trading point in New Mexico.

CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC
Snn Francisco, Nov. 15. Thirty
three counties in Cnlifornin remninod
to be heard from todny In the official
election ennvnss. Early returns from
five counties mnde the difference be
tween the lowest Democrn'.lc elector
and tho highest Republican elector,
5,031, the lowest Democrat having thnt
majority.
Both parties admit that a big dis
crepancy would hnve to be found in
order to change the California result,
and such n discrepancy could only
come from the threo most populous
counties in the state, San Franciscu,
Los Angeles or Alameda. Tho first
dny's work in these counties disclosed
only minor changes.
