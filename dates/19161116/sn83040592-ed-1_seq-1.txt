PUBLIC VS.
PRIVATE PLANT
Kansas Cry Engineer Here to
Give Expert Advice on
Gty Water- Works
. Problem.
In providnr for a new water
works system for Baxter, which
now appears necessary to -meet
the needs of the city, the city
council may be depended npon to
make no mistake. It will not
srant a franchise to any concern,
nor will it go into debt for a
municipal plant until the subject
has been thoroughly investigated-
Friday afternoon the members
of the city council and a number
of business men gathered at the
city building and heard a very
instructive talk on the subject of
waterworks by W. K. Palmer,
head of the W. K. Palmer Com
pany, of Kansas City, consulting,
designing and supervising engi
neers, who at present are engaged
on surveying the Oklahoma ,&
Northern Traction Co., which
proposes to build from Bartlesville
to Joplin via Baxter Springs.
Mr. Palmer has installed a
great many water plants in
Kansas and the southwest. He
advised against the granting of
such a franchise as the city has
now under consideration, but he
did not say that it would not be
best to grant a franchise to a
private company. Whether Bax
ter should build its own plant or
grant a franchise, he said, was a
matter to be determined by a
thorough study of lb situation.
If, however, a franchise should
seem better, he advised that the
city employ a competent engineer
to prepare one that would fully
protect the city's interests. It
should require the installation of
a certain size and type of machin
ery that would be adequate to
take care of the needs of the city
up to a certain population, also
new machinery, not worn out
junk. The franchise also should
stipulate a reasonable scale of
prices for hydrants and private
service ($75.00 a year per water
plug was altogether too high.)
In case no private company
Bhonld want to accept a franchise
that would fully protect the city's
interest, then the city should
build its' own plant. In that
cae plans and specifications
should be prepared and an esti
mate of the cost made before
the matter of bonds is taken up.
A. municipal plant, said Mr.
Palmer, if managed by competent
men, can be made to pay fof
itself and prove a profit to the
city. There should be no reason
hv Baxter SDrincrs should obiect
to voting bonds for a municipal
plant The excuse that bonds
had been voted in years past with
no benefit to the citv. should not
obstruct the city's progress now.
The thing for Baxter to do now
is to get on a business basis.
At the close of the talk Mr.
Palmer was asked to make a
nranrMition to the citv as to his
charges , for doing two things.
First, to prepsre a franchise that
would fullv protect the citv in
case it were deemed best to erant
a franchise to private company.
Second,, to prepare tentative
olans and estimate as to the
needs of the civ in the mutter of
water plant. Mr Palmer
promised to come again within a
few dava snd rive the ccmncil a
definite answer.
The News is arlad indeed to
w the council place this matter
in the bands of comntent
engineer to worV not and not
go at the matter Mindly as tnanv
another council in other cities
has done, to be much regretted
later on.
Preaident McWilliams of the
Commercial Club received word
from Mr. Palmer that he would
be in Baxter Thursdav. prepared
to give the council definite infor
mation on the suMt of water
wnrki and' a soecial tneetinar of
tne council will he held Thursdav
night to bear Mr. Palmer and

Old Couple in Distress.. -Oo
bis way in from a little
hunt across tbt rivet Monday J.
O. Treece found an elderly couple
hovering over a little camp fire
at one end of the bridge. TbTy
appeared in distress and Mr.
Treece went down to talk with
them. He found them very
scantily clothed, without food
and almost froxea. They had a
little old horse and a rickety
covered wagon and were trying
to make their way to a point
near Coffey ville they said, where
they bad some j-elatives they
thought. Mr. Treece took the
couple to his home and warmed
and fed them, and found some
clothes for them. Then they
went down to Geo. Sikes and
were given a bed in the camp
house, and thert they were
yesterday waiting for the weather
to moderate so that they might
proceed on their journey.. The
case was surely pittaoie, out
people on the road a geeat deal
say they often see similar cases
of distress, and few people give a
thought;! these poor homeless
wanderers.; . r
Two small fires last week gave
the Baxter fire department work
which the boys did well. The
first waa the residence of Dick
Stallsmith in the south pait of
"town, which was damaged about
$150. The next day the home of
E. A. Haines near the Willard
elevator was partially burned,
loss about $150. The occupants
were away at the time and neigh
bors turned in the alarm. Fire
caught under the stove.

STILL ANOTHER
ELECTRIC ROAD
Bartlesville to Joplin-Via Baxter
.Springs is Route Surveyed
Looks Like Real -Thing.
.
Reliable information gives The
News the opportunity to state
that Baxter Springs is to have
still another railroad, in addi
tion to the Southwest Missouri
that already is building here from
Galena.
The new competitor for Baxt
er's rapidly Increasing business
is -the Oklahoma & Northern
Traction company that is going
to build a line from Bartlesville.
Okla., to Miami, thence north
through the mining district to
Baxter Springs and Columbus
and on to Joplin.
It is well known that for sever
al weeks the W. K. Palmer En
gineering Company has had a
crew of engineers working close
to Baxter on the west and north,
locating a railroad. A. S. Had
ley has had charge of this. work.
Last week W. K, Palmer, "head
of the company, was down and
apent several hours in Baxter
Springs, in company with Mr.
Hadley. While here Mr. Palmer
announced that the Oklahoma &
Northern Traction company was
going to build an electric line
from Bartlesville to Joplia and
they expect to have all the pre
liminaries out of the way so that
construction can be started about
the first of the year or shortly
thereafter. .
This is not a promotion scheme
of John R. Rose. The impres
sion might be such, due to the
fact that the Palmer Engineer
ing company, also' did the sur
veying for the Rose proposition.
The road now proposed is being
financed by wealthy oil men in
Bartlesville
"The northern division Mr.
Palmer says, will extend north
Jrom Miami, through Commerce,
Cariin and Picher, to Columbus,
with a branch from Picher to
Baxter Springs where it will con
nect with the Southwest Missouri
company's line which is going to
be extended from Galena to this
place within the next few months.
The Oklahoma & Northern
Traction company is composed of
two men, Mr. D. F. Mason and
F. M. Overess both wealthy oil
operators of Bartlesville. They
have no stock to sell but probably
will ask Columbus, Baxter
Springs, Commerce and Miami
for amall bonuses and may also
ask for some assistance in pro
curing rights-of-way, although
Mr.' Palmer said these matters
have not been determined defin
ately. According to Mr. Palmer, all
of the surveys for the main line
have been made and those for-the
northern division sre just being
completed. Mr. Palmer admits
the company has not been in
corporated but he says that is a
matter that will be attended to
very shortly.
"The reason that I did not
have much to say when I waa in
Columbus with Mr. Mason and
Mr. Overlees a short time ago,
and I might sav it is also the
reason whv we have not yet
incorporated, said Mr. Palmer
to a reporter late yesterday after
noon, "was that we were not
seeking any publicity until we
knew definitely just what we
were going. to do. Now we know
we are going to "build and I look
for constmction to be started at
Joplin snd Bartlesville about the
first of the year." ' -
