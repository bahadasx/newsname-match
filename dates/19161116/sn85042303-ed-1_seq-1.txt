TO APPLE MEN
OF NORTHWEST
President Wilson was in New York
for a few minutes more than half an
hour on his way back from Williams-
town, Mass., to Washington. Three
thousand people were lined up beside I
the pier at West 7th St., to cheer
when he landed from the Mayflower.
With him were Mrs. Wilson. Miss Mar
garet Wilson and Miss Helen Wood
row Hones. They had come down the
Hudson in the Mayflower from Ithltie-
iliff during the night.
The party took a waiting automo
bile and started downtown to the Penn
sylvania station at once. As they
climbed the steep grade leading down
to the landing the president's car
slowed nlniost to a stop, which gave
a half dozen enthusiasts on tli" side
walks a luniee to run out and grasp
his hand. As the president drove
down liroudway, having behind him
the crowd that had gathered to see
him, the procession of live automobiles
led by a police car with a dunging
gong, attracted much attention, hut
few people realized till he hail psnseil
Unit the president was In one ol the
a ut os.
At l'ilty seventh street, Miss Mar
garet Wilson left the party, as she
was to remain with friends in N'eu
York. The president drove on down
Ilroadway. Another big crowd wail

M. House, Cordon Aiichlncloss, Colonel
House's son in law ; Ainlusador
Gerard and Alderman John F. MeCourl
were among those who met him as he
Isiurded his private car, the May
flower. A crowd consisting largely of rail
road men, remained about the platform
of the president's car until it pulled
out, cheering both Mr. and Mrs. Wil
son. There were several shouts of
"Thank you lor the eight hour law."
The president smiled but made no oth
er response. In the picture, from left
to right, are President and Mrs. Wil
son, Miss .Margaret Wilson and Miss
Hones.
