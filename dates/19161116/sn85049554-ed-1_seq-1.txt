Red- Oak, Nov. 16.—'A. W. Hill, a
farmer living near Villisca, was put on
the stand this morning to tell of what
occurred at a third meeting which De
tective J. N. Wilkerson of Kansas
City, is claimed to have addressed and
made statements connecting the name
of Senator F. F. Jones with the famous
Villisca ax murders of 1912 and for
which Mr, Jones is now suing the de
tective to recover $60,000 alleged dam
ages. Hill said he attended a meeting
one dark night last August, held on
the farm of John Montgomery, father
of the murdered Mrs. Moore, and at
which Wilkerson said he "had evidence
that F. F. Jones had furnished the
money to pay* for the murder of Joe
Moore".
Hill also testified that Wilkerson de
clared the grand jury which refused to
indict senator Jones had on !t warm
personal friends 'Of the senator. Les
ter Scott, shoeman, and C. M. Orr, pro
duce merchant of Villisca, were also
on the stand this morning and further
corroborated testimony of Gill Roth,
given yesterday, of the- meeting held in
the Pryor pasture south of Villisca. J.
W. Noel, a Villisca photographer, was
the only other witness of the morning
and merely told of Wilkerson seeking
photographs of Albert V. Jones and
wife from him. On motion of Wllker

QUI Roth, a.Villisca farmer, declared
he attended a meeting held about Aug.
8, 1816, in a pasture oil the Pryor farm,
three or four miles south of Villisca, at
which he sa^d Wilkerson spoke "prac
tically the ent|re afternoon." Roth was
in the witness chair for nearly an hour
and a half and was questioned at
length regarding the statement the de
tective is claimed to have "made at that
time. Questioned as to the factV
whether Wflkerson said Anything to
connect the name of Jones with the
deceased, Joe Moore, Roth was finally
permitted to state that Wilkerson used
the words "F. F. Jones furnished the
money to pay for the murder of Joe
Moqre." In attempt to show malice
Attorney Beeson cf Jones' counsel
asked, "What, if anything, was said
there by J. N. wilkerson, with refer

competitor of F. F. Jones," responded
Roth.
tolls of Alleged Night Plot.
On cross examination Ed Mitchell,
attorney for Wilkerson, drew from
Roth the story Wilkerson told the
crowd at the meeting of- the alleged
"murder plot" on the bank of the
Nodaway, Roth declaring that Wilker
son related what Vina Tompkins said
she overheard. This story, which the
Tompkins woman is said to have told
Wilkerson, Was to the effect that she
was a member of a camping party in
the fall of 1911,''on the banks of the
Nodaway river. While'going to gather
kindling she is said to have told of
overhearing some men talking In low
tones. She dropped behind the bushes,
so the tale goes, and told the defective
thpt she heard the men plotting the
jnurdsr of Joe Moore. F. F. Jones, his
son Albert V. Jones and one Jake
Weem£, according to this story, were
the plotters. Mr. Mitchell also drew
from the witness the story a man by
the name of ThoTp Is claimed to have
told the deteictive. This story in ques
tion was that Thorp boarded a train
at Shenandoah the morning the Moore
murder was discovered that two men
got on the train there and engaged in
a conversation, one of them telling him
that Villisca was in great commotion
over a murder and that they had left
town because all strangers would bo
suspected. The men were very ner
vous, the story goes, and dropped off
the strain 4n the railroad yards at New
Market. According to the Story Wil
kerson is claimed to. have told at the
meeting one of these men were identi
fied as William Mansfield, whom a
Montgomery county grand jury failed
to indict in connection with the Moore
tragedy. S?
Said 'Rumcr Was Old -One.
During his testimony Joe Aldrlch, a
dairyman, said, 'There had been a
rumor «ver since* the Moore murder
that the Joneses had something to do

Jones vith thf
(Bv a Staff Correspondent.)
Red Oak, Nov. 16.—Not since the
day of the famous Tom Denison trial
has the court1 room at the Montgomery
county court house been the scene of
the intense interest which it was the
second day of the suit brought by Sen
ator F\ F. Jones, of Villisca, against
J. N. "Wilkerson,: a Kansas City, Mo
detective, for damages in the sum of
$60,000 alleged to have resulted from
rumors and stories set afloat by Wil
kerson" and imputing that Senator
Jones was the moving spirit in the
murder of Joe Moore, his wife and four
children and the two daughters of Mr.
and Mrs. Joe Salinger, which occurrcd
in the Moore home at Villisca on the
night of June 9, 1912.
Attorney's Statements.
After sketching the story of the
Moore murders, R. W. Beeson, of
Jones' counsel, declared in his state
ment to the Jury: "I claim that this
defendant has slandered and defamed
the .plaintiff, F. F. Jones, by public
statement that he furnished the money
to pay for that horrible murder. We
are asking that he be placed right so
far as the verdict of a jury can place
him right."
Stating that? the plaintiff had four
causes for action, Mr. Beeson declared
that on August 8, 1916, Wilkerson,
"who pretends to be a detective, held
a public meeting in the-brush south of
Villisca," and there talked for five
•hours by the watch and that a great
deal of tha£, talk was directed against
Senator Jones. "That' was after the
grand jury of this county had refused
to Indict Senator Jones," he added.
Be«son Intimated that the purpose of
this meeting and^of Others which he

expression 'attributed to Wilkerson at
one of these alleged meetings. An
other statement alleged to have come
from Wilkerson was "We have this
man Mansfield, who wielded the ax,
and Senator Jones is the man that paid
the murderer of Joe Moore."
Beeson held that It was the conten
tion of the plaintiff that such state
ments were made "falsely and mali
ciously."
"Old women stories and pipe
dreams," was the description Beeson
applied to evidence which might be in
troduced to show Jones' alleged con
nection with the murder. Before clos
ing his statement Mr. Beeson leaned
over the table and shaking his finger
in the face of Wilkerson, who sat op
posite, shouted that the detective had
been here two years "to frame up a
case and convict an innocent man."
The expression "so-called detective"
was used frequently by Mr. Beeson in
his statement.
Senator Van Law With Jones.
The presence by the side of Senator
Jones of Senator C. H. Van Law of
Marshalltown injected a new element
Into the case. Before beginning his
statement to the jury on behalf of
Wilkerson, Attorney Ed Mitchell, of
Council Bluffs, took occasion to com
ment on his presence in Red Oak. In
the midst of his opening remarks to
the jury Mr. Mitchell turned toward
Senator Van Law and declared that
one Vina Tompkins from whom it is
claimed Wilkerson learned of an al
leged murder plot held on the banks of
the Nodaway, near Villisca, at which
Senator Jones is alleged to have been
present, was ready to testify for Wil
kerson in this trial. "But now, she
comes here, today in the care of Mr.
Van Law." "And her husband, too,"
rejoined the senator.
"We do not claim that Mr. Jones
ever advised anybody to murder any
body, but Joe Moore," declared Mr.
Mitchell, and then went on to say that
the man who committed the crime was
compelled to destroy the other sleep
ing members of the household in order
to keep under cover the perpetrator of
the murder
As a possible motive for Mr. Jones
wanting to be rid of Joe Moore, Mr.
Mitchell related ^ow Joe Moore came
t© Villisca years ago and worked for
Mr. Jones, was. a faithful employe and
gained the confidence of Implement
men who later started him Into busi
ness, men with a line' of implements
formerly handled by Mr. Jones. This
vyas done to the detriment of Mr. Jones,
the attorney said. Evidence will be in
troduced, Mr. Mitchell said, dealing
•with all of Wilkerson's actions which
he took as a detective for the Burns
agency to locate the murderer of Joe
Moore and family.

The name of Mansfield was fre
quently mentioned in this connection
and the evidence will probably seek to
bring out that the ax with which the
murder was done was in his hands.
This ax. will be shown to the jury.
From Mr. Mitchells' statement it is
gathered that the defense Will en
deavor to show that all of the material
collected by Wilkerson, In his search
for thef-murderer tended to show that
the crime was the result of a conspi
racy composed of F. F. Jones, his son,

Berlin, by wireless to the Associated
Press via Sayvllle, Nov. 16.—Asser
tions that the German submarine which
sank the British ship Rowanmore, upon
which thiere were Americans, fired upon
lifeboats containing members of the
crew, are dismissed as utterly false in
the report of the commander of the
submarine, details of which were mado
today. In- fact, It is said the men on
the Rowanmore owe their lives to the
precautions taken by the Germans and
the skill with which their operations
were carried out. During the twenty
minute pursuit of the ship the subma
rine's shots were aimed accurately
astern, to limit the danger to the crew
which was at the bow. The Rowan
more was hit ten times, the last shell
disabling the propeller.
The submarine ceased firing, the re
port says, at once it was observed the
Rowanmore had slackened speed and
given up efforts to escape. No shots
wpre fired at the men In the boats. Just
before she stopped the ^hip hoisted a
signal, but it was Impossible to read
from the submarine at that time, about
.2,000 yards away. Later it was shown
that the signal was: "I surrender."
The captain of the Rowanmore at
tempted to justify his attempt to es
cape, the submarine commander re
ports, by the assertion that he wanted
to gain time to launch life boats, but
this pretext was not accepted. Later the
Rowanmore's captain was made a pri
soner of war for trying to escape and
for summoning assistance by wifeless,
which brought up a British destroyer.
Thereupon the Rowanmore was sunk
by a torpedo.

Albert V. Jones, Jake Weems, William
Mansfield, W. P. McCaull, and others.
Despite the fact that the court room
was crcwdcd to Its capacity there was
scarcely a movement in the audience
during Mr. Mitchell's statement to the
jury. Before he had proceeded far the
perspiration was pouring from his face.
Now and then In the course of his
statement Mr. Mitchell would turn to
ward Senator Jones and punctuate his
remarks with crashing blows with his
fist on the table in front of him. The
senator appeared unmoved. While his
attorney was making the statement to
the jurors Wilkerson sat most of the
time with his eyes riveted on Senator
Jones, paying slight attention, appar
ently, to what was being said, but
evincing more Interest in their effect
on the plaintiff.
While the selection of a jury did not
attract many spectators the afternoon
session of court saw the room filled
until standing room was at a premi
um. Scattered thruout the audience
were a few women. Ross Moore, bro
ther of the Moore, the murdered man,
and John Montgomery, father of Joe
Moore's murdered wife, were among
those in the court room. Albert Lee
Jones, son of Senator Jones, sat be
side his father during the afternoon.
Judge Rockafellow, who Is sitting in
the trial, has ordered that the jury bo
kept together and that they be per
mitted to see no newspapers.
^•Wilkerson created a commotion in
the court room Just before adjourn

altercation with Attorney Beeson.
Beeson was eonversin/ with County
Attorney Gillett directly in front of the
bench when Wilkerson accused the
county attorney of revealing to Beeson
what iittiiapirod in the grand jury room
during the Mansfield investigation.
Beeson retorted that Wilkerson could

The wrangle became so loud that the
court was compelled to Intervene.

1,300 VOTES CAST
FOR DEAD IOWAN
Taylor County Democrats Cast Ballots
For Supposed Candidate Who Has
Been Dead For Six Year*—Wae
Nominated in Primary by One Vote.
Shenandoah, Nov. 16.—After being
dead for six years a man named Dun
can, listed on the ballot as a demo
cratic candidate for representative, re
ceived^ 1,800 votes from the voters of
Taylor county at the recent election, it
became known here today.
C. A. Hall, the republican candidate
for the same office, had no opposition.
He thought that there was no demo
crgtlc candidate. When the ballots
were printed the name of a *lMr. Dun
can" appeared and people wondered
who it was.
The state auditor was called upon,
but he knew nothing of the man ex
cept that a voter at Clearfield haa
written in the man's name at the prl
jnary and consequently it was placed
on the balrat. ••'•.'
Investigation led to the disojpvery
that the man had heen dead .for six
years.
BURLESON TO KEEP POST.
Not Popular With Democrats, but Will
Probably Hold Plaoe.
Washington, Nov. 16.—It was stated
here that Postmaster General Burleson
probably would not give up his place.
Burleson hsis always regarded himself
as the "master politician" of the ad
ministration, but many prominent
democrats hMd a different opinion of
him. In*'-fact, they have asserted that
Burleson has been one of the worst li
abilities of the democratic party.
However. Burleson stands close to
the president, and it Is doubtful If out
siders will be able to cause his resigna
tion.
There was considerable talk In
Washington to the effect that congress
will be kept In session over Ihe Christ
mas holidays. Chairman Fitzgerald of
the house appropriations oommlttee Is
excedingly anxious to have this done
on the ground that much work Is to be
done this short session. However, It
Is thought that when tho prospect of
remalninR away from home over the
holidays confronts the members of the
house and senate they probably will
entertuin a different view of the urgen
cy of the work before congress.

New York, Nor. l«?iPredlctlons of
"splendid" American. mWchant taarlae
as a result of the world war, and the
federal reserves act on shipping legis
lation, were made here today by Steph
enson Taylor, president of the Society
of Naval Architects and Marine En
gineers, in a speech marking- the open
Ing of the twenty-fourth annual meet
ing of the organization.
The United States, he said, was mak«
Ing rapid strides In ship building.
Whereas between 1910 and 1914 this
country produced only 8^4 per cent of
253,000 tons as against Great Britain's
50 per cent of the annual world pro
duction of 2,7-40,000 tons, Mr. Taylor
declared. Great (Britain In 1918 would
produce 2,260,000 tons and the United
States 865,000, an Increase In 14 pes
cent for Great Britain and about 8 per
cent for the United States over the fig
ures for 1915.
The normal tonnage of the world. SO,*
000,000, has been sadly dcp!*tMl hv tha
war, said iMr. Taylor, due to the de
struction of 6.000.000 tons, the Intern
Ing of 4,400.000 tons and the conn
mandeerlng of 12,000,000 tons, leaving
available for service 28,600,000 tons, of
$7.2 per cent of the normal tonnage.!
TMb reduction was responsible for thai
high marine fAlght rates.
