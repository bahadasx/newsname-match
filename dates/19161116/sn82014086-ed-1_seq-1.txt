NO LAPSE IN SERVICE
' OF PRESIDENT WILSON
Will Take Oath of Office on Sunday,
March 4.
Washington, Nov. 15. There will be
no lapse in the service of President
Wilson, because of the fact that March
4 next, inauguration day falls on
Sunday, according to an opinion reach
at the state department. It became
known today that on account of re
ports that a lapse would occur and
that Secretary Lansing would be act
ing president on March 4, a form let
ter explaining the law has been pre
pared at the state department to be
sent out In answer to inquiries on the
Question. White it is not expected that
the formaS inauguration of President
Wilson will be until Monday, March
6, he will be advised by Secretary
Lansing to take the oath of office on
Sunday.
If Charles E. Hughes concedes the
re-election of President Wilson by next
Friday, Vance C. McCormick, chair
man of the democratic national com
mittee, probably will discuss plans for
the presidential inauguration with local
democratic leaders when he comes to
Washington that day. Usually the
chairman of the inaugural committee
which has charge of the parade and
other civic ceremonies is selected soon
after election. It Is taken for granted
by officials that the president, follow
ing out his plans of lj13, will have
no inaugural ball.1

RUMORS OF SUBMARINE OFF
NEW ENGLAND COAST
bteamer Howard Received Wireless
Warning of Presence of Enemy.
Providence. R. I., Nov. 15. A British
warship, lying oft shore, sent a wire
less message to the Merchants & Min
ers steamer Howard early today, giv
ing notice of the presence of a Ger
man submarine off the coast of
southern New England, Captain John
B. Ryan of the Howard reported on
the arrival of his vessel here today.
The Howard . was off Block Island
when the message was received. The
British' warship,. Captain Ryan said,
gave neither her name nor nnsitlnn
inThn riimi 1 1 n iri-- tt-t-1 1 n , t V, . r
j'wmtttng'ni whlLh was interpreted"
ashore to mean that she was in readi
ness to act as convoy for the German
submarine trader Deutschland, now
preparing to leave New London for a
return voyage to Bremen.
Persons familiar with wireless operations-
expressed doubt that the
message picked up by the Howard
came from a British cruiser. It Was
said that although British warships
were presumably off the coast, high
powered wireless stations in Canada
and the Bermudas had been sending
out similar messages broadcast for
the last month and that it waa prob
ably from one of these stations that
the Howard's despatch came.

ED IN THE COURTS
TWO SUITS NOW - FILED
New York Central and Erie Roads Seek
to Restrain the Government From
Putting Law Into Effect Ask Court
to Define What It Means.
Washington, Nov. 15. Suits by rail-
' .ivmi6 wiiDiaiUUUItlUlljr
of the eight-hour railroad law .were
uce un lonay in many parts or the
country and the department of- Jus
tice laid plans to defend them.
Will be Many Suits.
No offer has yet been made by ISie
railroads to settle the question by one
test case. It was stated officially that
Attorney General Gregory has made
no such proposition to the railroads
and the department is planning to con
test each suit as it comes up for hear
ing. Assistant Attorney General Un
derwood will have direct charge of the
government's defense and Frank Ha
german of Kansas City, JJxj.. has been
retained to assist him. Mr. Under
wood expects to appear personally in
most of the -cases, but their number
may take it necessary to employ other
special counsel.
t Lines of Defense Laid. a
The attorney general and Solicitor P
General Davis have been in conference
with Mr. Underwood frequently since
the first suits were filed and the gen
eral lines of defense have been laid.
Information so far reaching the de
partment shows that the railroads
base their prayers for temporary re
straining orders against the law be
coming effective on the ground that it
is unconstitutional' and incapable of
enforcement. The government will re
sist those contentions and assert that
congress had ample power to enact
such legislation.
Prompt Decision Possible.
Prompt and final decision by the
supreme , court of constiXiioriality of
the law is possible under federal court
practice, it was stated today by law
yers familiar with federal procedure.
Under accepted practice, it was ex
plained, in any of the district courts
where test suits are brought, the dis-.
trict judge might call in one or two
district or circuit judges to sit with
him in the case. After a decision by
such a "Crfurt,-if was' stated that, as
the constitutionality of an act of con-
could lie taken direct to the -.-supremo
court without delay for its considera
tion by a circuit court of .-appeals. ;
Cases May Have Priority."
Should a test case or cases be -appealed
to the supreme court, . it was
believed here that, despite congestion
of . important cases on its docket the
court would- advance Adamson - act
proceedings for early hearing and de
cision. ...s. '.. . -
Some of the railroad brotherhood
leaders are -expected 'hetierM'Within a

son. The statement of Samuel Gompers
that the law would go into effect, "in-
X junction or no injunction", and the
statement ot W. S. Carter, head of -the
locomotive firemen and enginemen, de
nying that a strike had been threat
ened if the law were not enforced, has
attracted attention among federal offi
cials. .--
SUITS FILED BY N. Y.
CENTRAL AND ERIE ROADS.
To Restrain the Government From
Putting Law Into Effect.
New York, Nov. 15. Suits filed by
railroads against the federal govern
ment to test the constitutionality of
the Adamson eight hour law, also are
expected to result in the interpreta-.
tion of the statute if it be upheld, the
railroad managers comprising the na- '
tional conference committee of rail
ways announced in a statement here
tonight. ,
Suits designed to test the validity
of the law and to restrain the gov
ernment from putting it into--effect
were filed in this city today by the
New York Central and Erie nuitawii.
Similar suits are to be brought
within the next fe wdays by each rail
road in the country in eaoh of the
federal districts it traverses, accord
ing to Elisha Lee, chairman of the
conference committee. Mr. Lee Is
sued a statement at the end of the
committee's three-day secrw session,
explaining the railroad's programme
in their fight against the law. The
statement follows in part:
"Two questions are involved in the
appeal by the railroads to the courts
tor light on the Adamson law.
"1 Is the law constitutional.
"2 If it is constitutional, what does
it mean ?
"Opinions have been expressed by
eminent authorities that ' the law is
unconstitutional ajid there are con
flicting opinions as to how the law, if
constitutional, should be applied.
"Therefore, the railroads must, as a
matter of duty,- ask the courts If the
law is within the power of congress.
It is a duty they owe, not alone to
the owners of these properties, but al-,
so the public that provides the reve
nues for the payment of wages. -
"If the law is - declared constitu
tional, it, is expected that the courts
will make clear its meaning and the
railroads, it is unnecessary to say, will
faithfully follow the instructions of
the courts."
