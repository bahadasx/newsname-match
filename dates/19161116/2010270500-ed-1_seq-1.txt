SiouxCity Journal, 11: Mrs. A.
L. Fletcher, of South Sioux City,
who underwent an operation at St.
Vincent's hospital Thursday evening
was ' improved yesterday The
Sioux City high school scrubs yester
day threw off the "jinx" which has
followed the team all season and
took the South Sioux City high school
team in camp with a 13 to 7 score.
The game was devoid of penalties
and rough playing except when
Sioux City was penalized in the first
quarter for offside. The local scrubs,
although starting in with a crippled
lineup, had the edge on thpir neigh
bors in both weight and height. In
the first quarter Haskins, Sioux
City's left half, fumbled to Gasser,
South Sioux City's right half, who
carried the ball from the 40-yard
line across the goal line. Lopp kick
ed goal. The second quarter show
ed no advantage for either side.
The game picked up in the second
half when Knott received a forward
pass on the 30-yard line and crossed
the line. Younger missed the goal.
Sioux City again scored in the last
quarter when Hogan received a pass
from Nugent on South Sioux City's
40-yard line. Younger Kicked goal.
Much fumbling prevented the locals
from rolling up a larger score. Ho
gan, Nugent and Younger played
the stellar roles for Sioux City high,
while Gasser and Lopp did much in
helping their team in holding Coach
Long's youngsters. The lineup:

GENERAL REVIEW OE CROP CONDI
TIONS IN STATE NOVEMBER 1
The yields of corn range from very
poor in some of the southern coun
ties to an excellent crop in many of
the eastern and northeastern coun
ties. It happens that the greatest
drought damage occurred in the
winter wheat belt where the acreage
of corn is not as largo or important.
Corn is far from normal but is a
good average crop for the state.
The quality is generally excellent as
there was only a very slight damage
from frost and the weather has been
most ideal for proper drying
Winter wheat and oats weigh out
well, the average weight per bushel
being higher than usual. Spring
wheat and barley are somewhat light
in average weight per bushel dye to
damage from rust and drought.
The yields of potatoes in the east
ern part of the state are generally
disappointing except the earliest
planted fields. In the western com
mercial sections, the yields exceeded
expectations. The average yield for
the state is less than 75 per cent of
a normal crop.
The total production of apples is
considerably less than a half crop.
Many of the farm orchards are so
badly infested with fungous diseases
and insects that a marketable pro
duct cannot be produced. The com
mercial orchards generally produce
a very high class of fruit but as yet
this industry is quite limited.
