Civic Club Elects
Mrs. Neil President
Beautiful In phraseology and ten
der In feeling was the annual report
of the outgoing president of the
Women's Civic Improvement Club of
Ashland, Mrs. E. D. Eriggs, after an
Incumbency of office for two years.
This report will be printed In full in,
Monday's Tidings.
A deserved tribute was bestowed
upon Mrs. Briggs in again tendering
her the position by the unanimous
rote of the club members present; an
honor which she courteously but
firmly declined.
Work that speaks for itself has
been accomplished in the past two
years. The earnest co-operation of
members and officers and the high
Ideal of improving the conditions of
our environment led to good results
and bound the club members in last
ing ties of friendship.
Many acts deserving of public re
port have been carried out, among
which were the awarding of thirty
five prizes for the building of sensi
ble but artistic bird houses which
were placed In Lithla park; the co
operation with mayor and council in
-waging a war against old tin cans
and filth in back streets and alleys;
the co-operation with the Commer
cial Club of the city in giving the
"home products" dinner which netted
the C. I. C. over $50; the gathering
and shipping of old textiles at a net
gain of $65 and of old periodicals of
$53, and of the planting of shrubs
and flowering plants and trees and
the eradicating of noxious weeds un
der the chairman of the city beauti
ful division; and the crowning act of
the entire administration of legally
adopting a new constitution and by
laws. Donations have been made to the
home band boys by regular monthly
payments; also to the committee and
superintendent of the children's play
ground, and for charitable purposes.
And amidst all this busy, arduous,
practical work one regular meeting
monthly was devoted to Intellectual
and literary work.
The new officers elected November
14 are. Mrs. Robert Nell, president;
Mrs. W. M. Barber, vice-president;
Mrs. Frank rutnam, recording secre
tary; Mrs Emma L. Jack, corre
sponding secretary; Mrs. W. D. Hodg
son, treasurer; Mrs. Sam McN'air,
Mrs. J. F. Rocho and Mrs. .A L.
Lamb, trustees. In every case the of
fice sought the candidate.
Political Class

The ladles' political class will meet
again Saturday afternoon at Auxili
ary hall. The city charter will be
taken up at this meeting and every
woman voter in the city should at
tend. Now that the election is over

1917 County Budget
Calls For 16 Mills
The budget of estimated expendi
tures of Jackson county is published
elsewhere In this issue and calls for a
tax of 1C mills. Owing to the im
mense reduction In assessable proper-
ty due to the removal of the Oregon-1
California railroad grant lands from i
the tax rolls and the decrease in
sessed valuation throughout the coun-;
try. tho 16-mlll tax will not raise as
much money as tne lwniu lax as -
sessea last year, me uuagei as prim
ed is worthy of the study of every
taxpayer. A final hearing on the
county budget will be held by the
county court at the court house at
Jacksonville on December 7.
Klamath Falls
Votes R. R. Bonds
Klamath Falls voted $300,000 rail
road bonds Tuesday for the purpose
of aiding Robert Strahorn in building
the proposed California, Oregon &
Eastern railroad. The bonds carried
1,222 to 104. Lakeview voted $20,
000 to purchase a right-of-way for
the same road, their bonds carrying
249 to 9. An era of unprecedented
activity is presaged in eastern Oregon
by the positive way. In which the vari
ous communities are going after the
building of the Strahorn roads.
Early Morning Fire
Burns Residence
A residence at the corner of Eighth
and C streets belonging to Mrs. J. K.
Reader was practically destroyed by
fira nat Tnpcrlnv mnrnlne about
5:30. The house was occupied by a
family by the name of Hacker. Ac-
cording to Fire Chief Robison the
fire started from defective wiring.
The house was in flames before the ,
blaze was discovered. The fire truck
made a fast run and had water on '
the house in a few minutes, and by
putting on two lines of hose checked
the fire before the house was totally ;
destroyed, but not before it was dam-
aged beyond repair. All the furni
ture in the upstairs portion was de
stroyed, and although a piano and a
few other pieces were taken out,
much of that on the lower floor was
ruined. The house was insured to
an extent which will cover about half
the loss. The furniture was not in
sured.
Soon after returning to the station
the truck was called out again by a
fire in a woodpile back of the Vienna
bakery which started from a bonfire,
but did no serious damage.
The Medford authorities have
passed an ordinance forbidding the,
use of spotlights on automobiles In I
the city limits and providing that
headlights shall be equipped with
dimmers or frosted on the upper half
so as not to glare.

The story of the fight to remove

Indeed to be congratulated upon the
successful culmination of their ef-

Last July the club owed $307.
War May Reduce
City Police Force
We at last have found something
which is going down because of the
war in Europe. Ashlaud's police
force will probably be reduced, with
a resultant saving to the taxpayers
of several .hundred dollars a year.
It works out like this: According to
Mayor Johnson, the hobo travel has
fallen off to about one-third its nor
may proportions owing to war pros-
Derity in the east, which has attract

of. He Is also working out a unique
Dlan of citizen policemen, eight in
hired. These volunteers will serve
without pay and will not be asked to
make arrests unless they wish, acting
more In an Informative capacity. Al
ready the city has five officials, the
park superintendent, water superin
tendent, mineral water plant super
intendent, street commissioner and
city electrician, all of whom have
been given some police powers, and

but it Is not thought likely.
Last year thousands of "bos" were
rounded up each month and given
lodging and free soup at the Fourth
street hobo hotel. This year the
travel is so light that one man should
be able to handle it.
The saving effected will amount to
within the neighborhood of $700 a
year, which will make a big cut in
the police fund in the city budget.

Crowning the announcement of
freedom from debt came the applica
tion of twenty-two new members read
at Monday's meeting. Only two res
ignations, both for good reasons,
were handed in. At the next meet
ing It is to be hoped that twice as
many more applications may be had.
Every dollar now paid into the club
goes for advancement of the city's
Interests, running expenses no longer
eating up the receipts.
Election of officers resulted as fol -
lows: President, Frank Jordan; vice -
president, Henry Enders. Jr.; treas
urer, Fred Engle. Six of the twelve
trustees finished their terms and the
following were elected: J. H. Mc-
. Gee, H. O. Frohbach, Louis Dodge,
jj. W. McCoy. W. E. Newcombe and
i Hal Mc.Valr. Mr. McCoy tried to de
J dine on the grounds that he had been
j connected with the club in one way
and another for many years, but the I
club members would have none of his
j objections and he finally accepted.
; Several very Interesting talks were
enjoyed. Superintendent Rriscoe
told of the work being, done to aid
students to keen In hluh Kehonl and
asked for the co-operation of the bus-N'T
iness men. Secretary Shinn told of,
his trip to the Grants Pass Bugar fac-!
tory. City Attorney Moore explained

of it.

Dope Points to Tie
In Saturday Game
Five hundred rooters from Med
ford equipped with megaphones and
flying red and black colors will bel
low forth cries of defiance from tha
east bleachers at the Ashland high
school athletic field Saturday after
noon, aided in their efforts by their
band. The bleachers on the west sldo
have been moved up to tho sidelines
and the entire membership of the lo
cal school will answer the waves of
sound which roll across from tha '
Medford side. At 2:30 o'clock sharp
the din will grow terrific and then
be replaced by a brief moment of
breathless silence broken by tha
shrill of tlic referee's whistle sending
the two undefeated teams of south
ern Oregon against each other In the
annual contest which marks tho cul
mlnntion of the football seiitioii in
the Rogno River valley.
A record breaking crowd is antici
pated and all indications point to
ward tho greatest game of the his
tory of the game in this section. On
the dope the Medford team hn9 a
Hliglit advantage, but the AshlandoM
are not conceding any advantage and
are sending in a team which has not
yet this season had an opportunity
to display Its full strength and i
more or less of an unknown quantity
From an unbiased viewpoint tha
game looks like a tie, and a total
score of more than fifteen points)
would come as a surprise. Captain
Cunningham may not be able to play
with Ashland, his neck still giving
him trouble from the smash received
In the second game of the season.
Brower is back in the game and will
probably start at end or in tho back
field. Ashland has an exceptionally
well balanced team with defensive
possibilities which are most encour- .
aging. Whether the fight and power
Is there remains to be seen. Coacli
Klum Is bringing up a team from
Medford which has been improving
With every gamo and which is not
handicapped by tho absence of a sin- '
glo player on account of injuries.
They are coming to win. Medford
will probably play an open game and
are said to have a bewildering as
sortment of passes and onsfdo kicks.
A big s'reet rally and bonfire will
be held downtown tomorrow ninht
and a special stunt is being arranged.
