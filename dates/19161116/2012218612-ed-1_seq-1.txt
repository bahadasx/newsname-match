[f You Want to Save Money,

In an article in "The Family'

7ember American Magazine
writer says:
3~e~ai~ id uncl of iinJ
>f 5, iiiy first impulse was to
'even it off," and if it hadn't'
been for an old friend of my'
father's I think I would have
succeeded in neatly paring it
down to zero.
"What were you thinking of
doing with that money?' he ask
ed casually one day.
"Well," I replied, 'I think I'll
just take that $45 and go for a:
little lake trip, and then I'll have
.500 to put in the bank.'
I'Why $500?' he said. Why
not $545?
"Oh," I replied, -you might as
well have an even amount.'
"Do you suppose you could
spare me five dollars?' he asked.
suddenly.
"Why, yes.' I replied, a little
sunrised that he should ask to
borrow money of me: but I hand-*
ed it to him.
"All right, then.' he said:
he' i"e deiars' hoding me
back that same bill. 'If you'll
just put this with that 8545 ycu
will have S550, and that's a nice
even amount. Now, if you'll
ut that in the bank, in three
months it will have earned five
fifty more, and surely in the
meantime you can scrape togeth
er 44.50 and then you'll have
an even $600 instead of $500.'
"Well, what could I do with
$600?' I asked, not very much
imressed. as the difference did
not seem worth the trouble.
"One thing you could do,' re
plied the old gentleman, 'would
be to ask your banker to buy a
thousand-dollar bond for you or,
rather, to lend you the extra
400, keeping the bond as secur
it, and then it wouldn't be long
before you would have a thou-:
sand dollars, which, for "evdn'
amounts" is a little better than
Five hundred.'
"Then with a pencil and paper;
e showed me carefully just how
long it would take.

Grass in Paper-Making.
In England there is a large use of a
Spanish grass called esparto as a di
luent for rag paper stock in making
fine white papers. As far back as
186 thistles were made into paper in
England. In 1788 autumn leaves were
made into paper in France. In 1828
corn husks were made into paper in
England, part of. which furnished the
title-page -for "Corbett's Treatise on
Corn," Corbett having grown the]
corn. Ia 1839 spent tan bark was
made into paper in England. In 1854
an English patent was issued to Alex- -
ander Brown,'- a Scotchman, for the'
making of paper from ferns. In 1862,
stalks of maize and sorghum were'
made into paper.
A Wonderful Maze.
At Waltham, Mass., there is a maze
which is a duplicate of the historic one
in the gardens of Hampton Court pal
ace, near London. It is a winding and
confusing group of paths, bounded by ]
high hedges; there are 1,000 trees(
which were planted in 1896. The to
tal -length of ali the paths is about -
one-third of a mile, and the shortest
path to the central pool is about one
fifth of a mile. It sometimes takes
visitors more than an hour to find
their way to the center; sometimes .
they give up and call for help in find
ig their way out.
