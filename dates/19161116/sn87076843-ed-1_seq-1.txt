Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.
The trouble with undersea war
is that it is not on the level.
It is reported that a "grave
note" has been handed Greece by
the allies, and taking previous
notes into consideration, one sur
mises that "grave note" carries
an invitation to go and jump into
a shell hole.
We fear that the Pittsfield,
Mass., housemaids who have or
ganized a union and demand $7 a
week for a 10-hour day will have
to wait until congress convenes.
The decision of the Episcopal
Church that wives must continue
to obey their husbands comes just
in time for the revival of King
Henry VIII.
"When the allies get hard' up
they-can always send the Italians
into the line for a three-yard gain.
That the Germans are building
ships for another merchant ma
rine must bo good news to the
British fleet.
It seems appropriate that the
place where the police and strikers
fight at Bayonne should be called
Constable Ilook.
Judging by the sick reports
from the National Guard on the
border, Texas had better set up as
a health resort.
If simplified spelling ever comes
into general use, it is to be hoped
that the very first change decreed
will be the dropping of that first
letter in opossum.
Perhaps, by the time another
Presidential campaign is on, the
Republican political campaign
managers will wake up to the fact
that tho country weekly newspa
pers are better advertising med
iums than some of the big fellows
have heretofore been willing to
concede.
YEGGS AT WESTON
Blow Safe in First National
Bank for $125.
When the Cashier opened the
First National Bank of Weston on
Tuesday morning they discovered
that Yeggs had been present the
night before and had blown the
front door of the safe.
They secured S125 in nickels and
pennies and rifled individual safe
deposit boxes.
The door of the inner vault had
been drilled but was not opened.

AGRICULTURAL NOTES.
Silago for Dairy Cow3 Increases
Milk and Butterfat.
Cows fed a ration composed
largely of silage produced 17 per
cent more milk and 28 per cent
more butterfat than those given a
ration consisting mainly of grain in
a feeding test conducted for 121
days at the Ohio Experiment Sta
tion. The silage ration was also
cheaper for milk production.
The cows gained nearly 8 per
cent in milk yield when put on the
silage ration. They produced but
terfat at a cost of 13 cents a pound,
while a cost of a pound from the
cows fed mainly grain was 22
cents. There was little difference
in the gains in live weight between
the two lots.
In addition to 58 pounds of silago
and 6.8 pounds of hay, the one lot
received only 4 pounds of grain con
sisting of oilmeal and bran. The
grain-fed lot received only 12
pounds of corn stover and hay, but
13.5 pounds of a grain mixture of
oilmeal, cornmeal and bran.

Some Hallowe'en Pranks of Forty
Years Ago.
(Continued from last week.)
Our old friend, John II. Mc
Knight, more familiarly known as
"Jade", for a number of years
resided on Second streets, between
Elm and Locust, and in the rear of
his residence lie had a nice little
livery stable. In a yard adjoining
the stable were stored at different
times a number of buggies, some of
which had been in use for a' long
time and were stored there be
cause they needed minor repairs.
One Hallowe'en some bold, bad
boys appropriated one of these
buggies and attached it to the rear
end of a south-bound freight train.
In those days all trains stopped in
the Burg, and when the head of a
south bound freight was at the old
water tank, the tail would be
about a square and a half further
north, or nearly opposite Jack's
livery barn. Well, these boys at
tached this old buggy to the ca
boose in a simple, but very effect
ual manner, using heavy telegraph
wire for this purpose. Then they
awaited developments. They came
soon after the train started, and
when the caboose reached Louisi
ana avenue it certainly was going
some, as was also the buggy, but
the latter began coining apart as
it passed the old depot and spokes,
felloes, tires and parts of the body
and running gear were scattered
all along the railroad as far south
as Roachton. It was learned after
ward from one of the railroad men
that the thills, front axle, and the
hubs of the two front wheels were
still attached to the caboose when
the train reached Lima, he end of
the division and the ruiains were
gently deposited on the junk heap
there. How boys could take de
light in such wanton destruction
of private property is past all
understanding.
On another Hallowe'en the boys
took all of the buggies, also all of
the horses, from McKnight's barn
and hid them in various places. Li
the morning shortly after the pro
prietor discovered his loss, a small
boy came up the alley, leading one
of the horses, and told Jack he had
caught the horse while it was wan
dering aimlessly about, and gently
hinted that a nice little reAvard
would be appropriate. This was
given him, and in a few minutes
up came another boy with another
horse, which he also claimed was
found wandering in the street. Boy
No. 2 got his little reward, in a
few more minutes Boy No. 1 reap
peared with another horse. Did
he get a reward this time? Nay,
nay, Jack had been 'worked
enough. Instead of a reward,
Jack told him if the remaining
horses were not returned to the
barn within one hour, he would
have Marshal Hayes after the boys
with a warrant for horse stealing.
That brought them to time, and in
a few minutes all of Jack's horses
were back in the barn. .By noon
all of the buggies had been loca
ted, and before sundown they had
all been restored to their rightful
owner. None of them were dam
aged. Jack, being of a rather
genial disposition, took the pranks
of tho boys in a good natured man
ner and soon forgave them, though

be remedied as soon as we can oc

Mothers are sometimes so thought
less as to neglect the colds which their
children contract. The inflammation
of the mucus membrane, at first acute,
becomes chronic and tho child has
chronic catarrh, a disease that is sel
dom cured and that may prove a life's
burden. Many persons who have this
loathsome disease will remember hav
ing had frequent colds at the time it
was contracted. A little forethought,
a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough Rem
