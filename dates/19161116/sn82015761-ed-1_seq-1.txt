PR0M0T0RS HERE,
FRANCHISE
A number of representatives
of the Coconino Water De
velopment and Stock Compan
are in Williams this week seeking
a franchise from the Town which
shall give the right to supply this
community with water. The inter
est of the News in Williamb is
paramount. The News wishes
Williams to have every good thing
which a Town may enjoy. Th
greatest of these things is good
water. The News realizes that the
water which Williams people are
compelled to use is not as good as
they should have, but in trying to
improve the water situation great
care should be used that we do not
jump from the frying pan into tthe
fire.
The Coconino Development and
Stock Company proposes to supply
Williams with water gathered in
the San Francisco Mountains which
shall be equal to the water which
Flagstaff enjoys. That sounds
good. But before entering into
any sort of arrangement with this
new company, the News believes
that the situation of the Town with
respect to its relations with the
Williams Water and Electric Com
pany should be fully considered
and the proposition of the new
company should be thoroly investi
gated. Williams Would Hold the Sack
Unless the Williams Water and
Electric Company is bought off, it
will fight the new company to the
bitter end. To grant another water
franchise in opposition to the pres
ent operating company would be to
iavite a struggle between rival
water companies. It might mean
competing wates systems with Wil
liams on the rack while the - fight
lasted, &nd Williams holding the
sack in the end.
The News believes that should the
Town Council decide to entertain
the proposition of the Coconino
Development and Stock Company,
the company should be compelled
to demostrate the soundness of its
general proposition to develop a
water supply and furnish high
grade water to communities
and especially to Williams. The
source of water supply should be
thoroly investigated. It should be
learned definitely what kind of
impounding reservoirs are to be
used. If they are to be wholly of
earth and small they will be mud
holes like the one from which the
Williams Water and Electric draws
its water. If they are to be large
enough not to be seriously affected
by wave action or incoming muddy
waters, then are they to be free
from orginic matter, living or
dead. This is an important ques
tion and unless satisfactorily
answered, it would be foolish to go
further with the investigation.
No "Wild Cat" Scheme For Us
Here is a proposition involving
the investment of a very large
amount of capital. If there is
doubt of its proving a good busi
ness proposition for the investors,
Williams should let it alons. The
Town can not afford to tie up to
any "wild cat" scheme. The
Town Council should then, in the
opinion of the News, ask for plans
,u iw me wuuai
.;a !,. ,i:i ti. n m,
snouiu kuow wnere me pipe line i.-
to run, how large it is to be; what
the estimated cost is and what
sources tf revenue will be relied on
to compensate investors.
While the News believes in the
proposition that in this advancing
era of the public ownership and
operation of , public utilities
it is not wise to commit a
municipalty to a long time

ed. A building site has been
donated and funds are now need

Over three thousand dollars
are yearly sent from Arizona, to
wards the support of the Cali

children in an Arizona Home?.
The only salaries paid are small
ones to the matron and one maid.

the home, at present. Those
who are old enough attend the
public school.
Here is a home for every Ari
zona child that needs one. Here
is a child for every Arizona home,
that needs one. Its merry prat

Who will be the first to subscribe
to the building fund or to join
the Williams branch . society ?
Dues are one dollar yearly.
The soul that (fives ia the soul that lives,

Doth lighten your own and shorten the way
and brighten the homeward road.

the benefit and appreciates the
opportunity afforded by Mr. Reese

RUM POWERS JOLTED,
4 NEW STATES DRY
The liquor traffic was hit a pretty
hard jolt Nov. 7. Four statei,
Michigan, Nebraska, South Dakota
and Montana adopted a dry amend
ment on that date. Majorities are
not-available at the present time
but they were heavy in some in
stances and enough in all. Missouri
and California also voted on a pro
hibition amendment but the prop
osition lost by a large majority,
some 125,000 in Missouri and 40
000 in California. Nearly half of
the states now have .prohibition.
If the movement to destroy the
liquor traffic continues at the rate
it has been going of late the next
ten years will leave very few states
with saloons and a national pro
hibition amendment will be a
certainty.
Mr. Dick Connor left on No. 7
Tuesday to attend the State Fair
at Phoenix. .
Wyatt Smith left for the State
Fair at Phoenix, Tuesday.
THE LAST GRIZZLY
OF THESYCAMORE
Frank ("Bear") Johnson was in
Williams last week and he was
persuaded to come in to the News
office and while there he was in
duced to tell the story of the killing
of the last grizzly of the Sycamore.
Johnson has been a "big game"
hunter all his life and has hunted
in the Rockies from Arizona to
Alaska. He thinks he has killed
fully 1,000 deer and he has
killed a great many bean and lions
and other big game of the moun
tains. For the last twenty years
and more, Johnson has hunted and
trapped off and on in the wilds of
the Sycamore. He says big game
is getting so scarce that there is no
longer profit in the hunt. Like
Roosevelt excepted, Johnson is re
luctant to tell of his thrilling ad
ventures with the ferocious ani
mals of the wild and it required
considerable tact to get the story,
told below. Johnson claims lesi
dence in Coconino County and vot
ed in the election in precinct No. 1.
I am a drinking man Johnson said,
and have drunk barrels of liquor,
but I don't want the boys to drink
and I came in to vote for the pro
hibition- aCisndment so that the
"stuff" may be kept out of their
Wy.
Frank Johnson is a small man,
probably 5 ft. 6 inches and weigh
ing 130 pounds. Size does not count
particularly when a hunter faces a
grizzly . and is so close that each
can smell the other's breath. - Un
der such circumstances, and they
have been numerous with Frank
Johnson, there must be a steady
aim and the target must be the eye.
Fortunately for Johnson his nerve
has been steady and his aim true
and the eye of his brute antagonist
has been pierced and instant death
has followed. To shoot a grizzly
any where else would mean death
to the hunter.
But to the story. "Bear" John
son is so interesting a character
that it is hard to drop him and take
up his modestly told yarn.
The Story
I had known for twenty years
that the old grizzly lived some
where in the Canyon and tho I had
seen her "sign" frequently, I had
never caught sight of her. I have
no doubt that she had seen me of
ten. You see, even a gnzziy does
not care to encounter a man and if
1 t ' 1 J !t xl
a auman can De avoiaea easily me
bear will go out of his way to keep
from meeting a man. But, if the
grizzly is surprised or crowded by
a man. . he will charge without a
moment's delay.
I kept a look out for the old beaf
thinking that some day 1 should
see her. How did I know it was a
she? Well, an old bear hunter can
tell that if he sees "sign" often
enough, and I knew that the sign I
saw was that of a she bear.
Nearlv two vears. ago the old
bear killed one yearling after an
other on the range that includes
the Sycamore basin. I thot I would
try trapping her but she would dis
cover my traps near a carcass and.
she would not eat more of it but
would kill another yearling. . I got
pretty mad about it and I deter
mined to hunt the old bear in earn
est. I thot I knew the side canyon
where she lived and I picked up
her trail and started after her. I
had a little Airdale which I took
along to help me keeo the trail.
The trail led up the vtry canyon 1
htd picked and I worked my "way
up thru mazanita brush so thick
that even my little dog had to go
around it in places. When I had
got prtty well towards the head of
