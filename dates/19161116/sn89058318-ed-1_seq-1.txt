Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, as they can
not reach the diseased portion
of the ear. There is only pne
way to cure catarrhal deafness, J
and that is by . a constituttional
'remedy. - Catarrhal Deafness-is;
caused by an inflamed, condition
of "the mucous lining of - the
Eustachian Tube. When this
tube is inflamed you have a
rumbling sound or 'imperfect
hearing, and when it is entirely
closed, Deafness is the result.
Unless the inflammation can be
reduced and the tube restored to
its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever. Many
cases of deafness are caused by
catarrh, "which is an in flamed
condition Vf the mucous surface

Mr. John M. Gerren, of Pike
ville was in our city tnis week,
and says he has leased the Bled
sonian to his former 'partner,
Mr. E. G. Wright, his duties -in
he educational lin? being so
great that he didn't have time to
look after it." Mr. Wright needs
no introduction to the readers of
his paper as he has : been 'con
nected in the printing business
for the last 20 years and we are
sure he will give the readers of
the Bledsonian the same good
paper they have had here-to-fore.

REMARKABLE RECORD ON
, : , ; BAGGAGE CLAIMS.
The record made by. the' the
Nashville, Chattanooga & St.
Louis Railway the past year in
the handling of baggage on its
lines U truly a remarkable' one;
when one stops to consider the
thousands of pieces of 'baggage
handled within a twelve-month
period on t railroad, ; l
The annual report -recently
submitted to the stockholders
shows that during the year the
loss and damage claims paid on
baggage was only, 1800.18 as
against $1,603.90 tho previous
year. It is doubted if any other
railroad in the country can show
such a record. j
While the payments for loss
ami damage to freight showed
a material reduction last year
as compared with the previous
year, the claim department
through a campaign for better
packing an 1 distinct marking of
freight, expects' to still further
reduce payments of this charac
ter, and has asked the co-operation
of all shijpers to this end.

PLANT PECAN TREES.
Native to the' South, at hm
practically everywhere from Vir-
ginta to Texas, the pecan is at
once anions flie noblest an! most
useful trees.- Highly valuable .
for fruit itis a beautiful orna
mental and shade tree as well. .
Thus co nhinln j; it does botlt
utility and beauty, it should be
found on every farm in the South.'
J?irticularly attractive is an
avenue of pecan trees leading up
to a farm home. There are to
day in, the South uucounted
thousands of hot, dusty lanes
that are terrors to travelers and
teams alike, but that might be
made invitingly cool and attrac
tive by a rov of pecan trees on
either side, and not only would
their shade be welcome, but in a
few years" they would provide a
decided addition to the income
from the farm. ' '
There will never be a better
time, than, the next few months
to start some pecau trees, and we
would suggest that rijjht now,
while the matter is fresh in your
mind, you wrife to your state ex- -periment
station, stating your
local condition, and ask their
advice as to the best varieties--
an 1 t!ie nearest reliable dealer.
w i II probably bear ma uy .crops .
before you are gone, and after -wards
your children and ,our
grandchildren w ill' reap where
you have sown and bless you. '
