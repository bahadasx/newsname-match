PATTDN'S ELECTION
' HAS BEEN
Wednesday Hon. Harry L.
Patton received a wire from
Santa Fe saying that his election
as attorney general of New Mex
ico had been conceded by the
Republican headquarters. The
face of the returns indicated all
along that Mr. Patton had been
selected, still it no doubt sound
ed good to him to have the op
position concede his election.
All Curry county feels proud
that the voters of the state have
seen fit to choose Mr. Patton for
this important position. That
he will serve the people faith
fully and well goes without
question.
On The Way.
The News is expecting its new
Model 5 linotype in most any
time now. It should have been
installed in the News office by
this time but the factory, owing
to a rush in orders, was not able
to make shipment as soon as
promised. The machine left the
factory, on November 1st and it
is now up to the railroads just
how quickly we will receive it
here.
Quotes Shakespeare
A quotation from "Romeo and
Juliet was incorporated in Vice

. of congratulation to President
Wilson. The telegram follows:
f J"Tis not so deep as a well,
" nor so wide as a church door,
but 'tis enough and 'twill serve."
PAYS FOURTH DEATH
CLAIM PROMPTLY
The past week the New Mex
ico Life and Aid Association paid
its fourth death claim. The de
ceased member was Mrs. Isla
Mann arid she died at Roswell,
following an operation in a sani
tarium at that place. The
death claim was immediately
paid to her husband, R. H. Mann,
who was named as her benefici
ary. The New Mexico Life and Aid
Association has had a most
successful business since
it was organized about eighteen
months ago. During this entire
time there have been only four
deaths in the ass )ciation a most
remarkable record, showing that
the association has exercised due
care in selecting its risks, The
plan that this association is or
ganized on furnishes cheap in
surance to many people that
might not in many instances be
able to carry other protection.
Another thing that commends it
to the people of this particular
section U that it is a home in
stitution under the guidance and
management of Curry county
people.
The first snow of the season
cam Sunday night. It was
J&nly a slight flurry, just enough
to cover the ground, but with
it came a blustry norther that
made the coal man get many
hurry orders from those who
had let their coal bins run low.
Hon. Harry Patton spent two
or three days'in Santa Fe last
week. The election returns
were coming in too slow to
please him and he decided to
make a trip to headquarters and
get some news while it was fresh.

Strong Photoplays To Be
Shown At The Lyceum.
Saturday, November 18th at
the matinee and evening per
formance will be shown "The
Song of the Wage Slave" which
is based on the poem by Robei t
W. Service, author of "The
Spell of the Yukon" and "The
Shooting of Dan McGrew." E1
mund Breese is featured in this
powerful and thrilling photoplay
which portrays the developement
in the character of Ned Lane,
one of the great army of work
ers, who sacrifices his identity
for the woman he loves and fi
nally life itself for the sake of
an ideal. There are many in

"Wid" the Bradstreet of film
dom, and most conserative of
film critics gays. "It is an ab
sorbing story with a powerful
star. It is verile and artistic,
and I feel sure that everyone
will greatly enjoy this offering."
"Notorious Gallagher," or
"His Great Triumph" will be
presented Monday. November
20. Maguerite Snow of "Million
Dollar Mystery" fame is the co
star with William Neigh. It is
the story of "Buttsy" Gallagher
a harmless young product of the
New York Bowery, who sudden
ly finds that he has come into
what he considers fame, through
being accused of a murder he
did not commit. The attention
and notoriety he receives flatter
him, and when he finds that he
is going to lose it all and that
his lawyer is going to prove him
innocent, "Buttsy" pleads guil
ty. The manner in which this
complication is unfolded, and the
introduction of a strong contrast
of life among the wealthy class
forms a series of delightful and
pleasing situations. "Wid's"
comment: "The story as a whole
is exceptional and there is a well
developed big idea. The stars
are excellent. It is surely a dis
tinctive offering, because there
is a central idea w.iieh is partic
ularly human. There is plenty
of action all thru the story. It
is something new, and you will
greatly enjoy it."

Cole BroB. Circus which was

to give an exhibition. The chow
came all right but the cold

hours and feeding the animals

cold weather the show failed to
give a performance in Roswell
the day before reaching Clovis
so they have been playing in
hard luck all around.
DEMDGRATS GET MOST
OF TIE STITE
New Mexico will have a Dem
ocratic governor and a Republi
can lieutenant governor during
the next two years. The unof
ficial returns show that DeBaca
has been elected governor and
that W. E. Lindsey of Portales
has defeated McDonald for lieu
tenant governor. The official
vote may change the totals of
the several candidates but it is
now absolutely certain that the
Democrats have elected Jones
for United States Senator, Wal-
ton for congress,
governor, Lucero for secretary
of state, Hall for state treasurer,
Patton for attorney general,
Montoya for corporation com
missioner, and the Republicans
have elected Lindsey for lieuten

EXCURSIONISTS LOOKING
AT THE SOUTHWEST
- ...
Fifty farmers from eastern
states, traveling in two private
Pullman car?, on the Santa Fe's
train No. 21, were given an op
portunity to see a good part of
New Mttico Saturday. The ex
cursionists stopped here for
breakfast, and as the country
was new to most of them, they
were very enthusiastic in antici
pation of an enjoyable trip.
"It so happened," said J. E.
Carr of Toledo, Ohio, a member
of the party, ' that several east
ern farmers wanted to make a
trip through the Santa Fe states
at the same time, and the indus
trial deparlment of the railroad
company arranged for us to go
together. Mr. Seagraves. the
industrial commissioner, planned
the trip for a dayligh: ride
through New Mexico. All of us
wanted to see this state, about
which we have heard so much in
the last few years."
The excursionists are investi
gating opportunities in the
Southwest, and it is their inten
tion to locate somewhere be
tween the Missouri river and the
Pacific coast. They will spend
two weeks on the Santa Fe rail
road. Several of the visitors asked
for information about Curry
county, and Clovis, which G. C.
Heston, the Santa Fe agent, said
would be furnished by the Clovis
Chamber of Commerce Mr.
Heston will have a list of the
party in a few days.
Bert Curless, secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce was on
hand when the excursion arriv
ed and gave out some advertis
ing matter calculated to interest
the ex:ursionists in the Clovis
country, the best section of
New Mexico.

SOME FACTS ABOUT -THE
RECENT ELECTION '
About the best figures at hand
give Wilson 8,563,713 and
Hughes 8,160,401 popular votes,
a plurality for Wilson of 403,312
votes.
Wilson carried 30 states and
Hughes carried 18.
Hughes cartied only five states
west of the Mississippi river.
Ohio and New Hampshire are
the only eastern states Wilson
can claim, This is the first time
in the history a president has
been elected without some of the
other thickly populated eastern
and northern states.
Nearly three million more
votes were cast for Wilson and
Hughes than were cast for Taft,
Wilson and Roosevelt four years
ago.
Wilson received over two mil
lion more votes than he received
four years ago and nearly a mill
ion more than both Taft and
Roosevelt received four years
ago, and received, the largest
popular vote given a president.
The republicans will likely
have a small majority in the
lower house of co gress and
Democrats will have a majority
in the senate.

016 REVENUE FROM
' BROOM CORN CROP
A good many favorable yields
of broom corn have been report
ed this year. The farmers have
derived an especially good reve
nue from this crop on account of
the prevailing high prices.
The A. B. Gurley Broom Corn
Co. of Clovis has purchased the
greater part of the Curry county
crop and there are many instan
ces of where they have paid far
mers more for their broom corn
than the land it was raised on
would sell for, This is true of
the broom corn raised by G. W.
Ryle of near Melrose. He had
fifty acres and made 100 bales of
brush which sold for in the
neighborhood of $2000.
Beautiful Assortment of
Diamonds.

Been in some time
A portion of this shipment has
been on display in their window
this week and has been attract
ing considerable attention. Es
pecially has the big $1250 stone
in the center of the display
caused the passeri-by to take
notice. At one shipment this
