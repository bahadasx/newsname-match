CLAYTON
CLAYTON TO HAVE
ENORMOUS RESERVOIR
PROVISION IN CONTRACT GIVES
CLAYTON CITIZENS PREFER
ENCE IN REGARD TO LABOR
AND TEAMS
yThe C. S. Lambie Company of Den
ver, Colorado has commenced work on
a half million gallon wateivreservoir
for the town of Clayton. This work
when completed will prove of inestim
able vaue to the town. The water sup
ply has been necessarily limited in the
past as the town Ion y ago outgrew
its water facilities. "'Work on new
and deeper wells has been progress
ing for some timeand when these and
the new reservoir which is now in
course of construction are complete
Clayton will have ample water supply
for some time to come, The reservoir
is being constructed of concrete and
will have eight feet of the base under
ground and well provided with set
tling tanks and everything modern
that goes to make up a first class res
ervoir. The contract price of this
reservoir is $10,500which, taking the
requirements of the contract that ev
erything is to be first class into con
sideration, would seem to be little en
ough for the work to be done An
other significant feature of the con
tract is the following provision which
our own laboring element will prob
ably appreciate: "In employing men
or teams, preference shall at all times
be given to residents of the- town of
Clayton and no one shall be employed
who is not a resident as long as local
labor is available which is suitable for
the work to be done." This is a time-
" ly provision in the contract protectng
the labor of the town of Clayon many
of whose laborers are her best contrib
utors in all that goes to make a good,
substantial, pr"essive town.sThe new
reservoir is being constructed on the
town's property near the power and
light plant and the comforts and ad
vantages ii will furnish the town
when complete cannot come too soon.

ORGANIZATION OF LOWER
HOUSE STILL IN DOUBT
Washington, Nov. 15. Incomplto
canvasses of the vote in several close
congressional districts today broutrht
no changes in the uoflkial election re
sults which would indicate that 217
republicans, 212 democrats, and
six
f other parties have been elected to
the sixty-fifth congress. Representa -
tive Doremus, chairman of the demo
cratic national committee, still claims,
however, that democrats will make
gains on the final returns in six or sev
en of the close districts, which appar
ently have elected republicans by small
Majorities. Speaker Clark and other
democratic leaders also confidently ex

ality.
Representative Woods, chairman of

Louisiana and the independent in Mas

R. Mann for speaker.
Prospects of a republican gain were
apparent in the thirty-second Penn
sylvania district, where the canvass
of all Pittsburgh precincts today
showed Representative Barchfeld lead
ing Guy Campbell, his democratic op
ponent, by twelve votes. On the un
official returns Campbell led Barch

Chairman Fitzgerald, of the house
appropriations committee, after dis
cussing with administration leaders to

to do away with the usual Christmas

NO
IMMEDIATE PLANS
T ORECALL PERSHING
San Antonio, TexaB, Nov. 14. Ma
jor General Funston said tonight that
no orders for a new disposition of
troops of the expeditionary force in
Mexico have been issued. Nothing at
headquarters indicated that an early
withdrawal of Geniral Pershing's com
mand is contemplated.
Officers pointed out that presence
of American troops in Mexico serves
to minimize the danger of border
raids. It is the opinion of military
authorities that Villa can hardly risk
a move against the Big Bend country
while Pershing's men are on duty, be
cause of the ease with which his re
treat back into Chihuahua could be cut
off.

RAILROAD STRIKE IS
AGAIN THREATENED
Road Officials and Trainmen Fail to
Agree on Adamson Eight-Hour Act
Old Walkout Order Still Effective.
Cleveland, 0., Nov. 13. A general
strike is certain unless all the rail
roads agreeto abide by the provisions
of the Adamson law, President Lee of
the Order of Trainmen announced this
morning before he left for New York,
where a big conference of the railroad
managers and the heads of the four
brotherhoods will be held.
This statement is taken as indicat
ing that the brotherhoods are expect
ing them to evade he law.
New York, Nov. 13. Danger of a
nation-wide railroad strike, which was
believed to have been averted by the
passage of the Adamson eight-hour
law, has not entirely disappeared. It
developed here today, when represen
tatives of the railroads and the four
brotherhoods, comprising 400,000 em
ploys, failed to reach an agreement
as to the proper application of the
new law. The stumbling block, both
sides admitted, was the existing mil
age system of compensation.
The announcement of the latest
deadlock between the railroads and
their employes came at the conclu
sion t an all-day conference between
the national conference committee of
the railways and the brotherhood
chiefs, which had been arranged in
September.
"We met," paid Elisha Lee, chair
man of the railroad managers and
the conference, "to exchange ideas on
the application and operation of the
Adamson law. We failed to reach an
agreement, and we are not certain
that another meeting will take place "
Strike is Hinted
William G. Lee, president of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen.
spokesman for the employes in thel'PP81 when Buit ,or an ia'
absence of A. B. Garreston of the Or-
der of Railway Conductors, declared
in a statement that in the event of
evasion by the railroads of the Adam-
son law summary action would be ta
ken by the brotherhoods.
He said that the strike order, which,
was directly responsible for the law,
still was in effect, and the brother
hoods would not hesitate to enforce 1
it if the occasion warranted it.
"The brotherhoods asked for this
conference," said Mr. Lee. "At the
morning session we discussed the ap
plication of the law, and found that
there was no basis upon which
we
cound possibly agree.
Roads to Press Lawsuits
"Another setback, besides the elim
ination of the mileage system, was,
the determination of the railroads toi
continue their suits to determine the
consituionalty of the law." I
The mileage sysem of compensation,
the basis of which is the number of ,
miles traversed by a train crew, and 1
not the actual hours of work, is the '
crux of the new problem that, a rail
road authority said, may result in the
development of a situation similar to
the one which brought into being . the
Adamson law.
"Frankly," said Chairman Lee of
the conference committee, in discuss
ing this phase of the situation, "the
trouble lies in the fact that neither he
railroads nor the men know definitely
how the law should bo applied.
"We have our own ideas as to how
the law shall be applied if at all as
suits to test its validity are now pend
ing, while the brotherhoods have their
own ideas."
Outcome is Uncertain
Chairman Lee added that he could
not predict the probable outcome of
the difficulty.
He said, however, that negotiations
might be resumed by calling another
conference. This possibility was
strengthened by the announcement of
the brotherhood chiefs that they, with
the. exception of President Lee of the
trainmen's organization, proposed to
remain here for several days.
President Lee left for his home in
Cleveland tonight. He said it was his
intention to join his conferees in
Washington Monday, where they will
go to attend the opening session of
the Newlands' investigating commit

BANDIT RIDES WITH THE
MEN HE HAD ROBBED
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 14. As the
(Missouri Pacific's Omaha-Lincoln ex
press train No. 108 was leaving Leav

Eighty dollars of this was, taken from
the conductor. The bandit then in
formed his victims that they might re
sume their seats. "I'll ride a way with
you," he said.

UNITED STATES TROOPS
SLAIN BY MEXICANS
ATTACKS ON GENERAL PERSH
ING'S ADVANCE FORCE ARB
FREQUENT. INTERVENTION IS
EXPECTED BY DECEMBER 13.
General Persning's forces at the ad
vanced base of Colonia Eublan con
stantly are being attacked by Mexi
can soldiers, many of whom wear Car
ranza uniforms, according to letters
received from militiamen now at the
border. The writers also declare that
news of the deaths of many American
soldiers in these skirmishes is being
suppressed. One million dollars is be
ing spent in establishing winter quar
ters at the border, the militiamen de
clare. They expect intervention to
come in December and do not expect
to be sent home before late in the
spring. Members of the- militia write
that almost every truck train which
arrives at the border from Colonia
Dublin carries the bodies of Ameri
cans slain in engagements with Mex
icans. .
"The last driver of an army truck
with whom I talked," one militiaman
writes, "told me that on his latest
trip he brought the bodies of six sol
diers. He also declared that he has
not made a single journey between the
border and General Pershing's head
quarters without being fired on."
The militiamen write that skirmish
ing is constant all along the border as
well as on the lines defended by the
regulars. The Mexicans are poor shots
they declare and therefore the Ameri
can casualties are few. The outlaws
frequently cross the Rio Grande in
their raids, usually on a moonlight
night, on acount of the superstitious
Mexican's dread oí a starless sky.
The militiamen believe intervention
will come by December 15. By that
time, according to their forecast, Villa
will be in control of all northern Mex
ico and the .Carranza soldiers in that
section, already the. enemies of the
Americans, will have gone over to
him. Then, according to their belief,
the American forces again will be or
dered across the line to "get Villa.".
"And we'll find him many times
more able to defend himself than
when the first order to capture him
went out," one soldier writes. "Scores
of Carranzistas are deserting to him
every day.
"To strengthen out belief that inter
vention soon will come, 220 rounds of
rifle ammunition and ninety of re
volver cartridges have been given out.
This war strength. Orders also have
been issued that none of the ammuni
tion shall be allowed to remain in
boxes, but that all of it shall be ready
for instant use."
THE LURE OF THE WILDS
Anticipation often brines more en
joyment than realization.' In proof of
this statement we will cite you to the
experiences of a couple of Clayton's
prospective young trappers (?) It
has been but a few short weeks, since
"Bab" Boggs and "Orve" Weckel, in
vigorated by the crisp autumn air, at
tained a longinrr for wilds and tho
sports attached thereto.' So great be
came the lure thft bein? unable to
stand it longer, they yielded up lucra
tive positions, provided themselves
with traps and "chuck" and departed
into the "unknown" wilds of Union
county, in pursuit of "wild animals."
Here comes the sad part of the story.
il lci auvvini wuciia ui yvi Diaieiib wir

find themselves unsuccessful as far aa
profits go, and their supply of "chuck"
almost exhausted. An S. O. S. call

was immediately sent to Clayton and
on Sunday last "Tim" Boggs motored
to their rendezvous and brought the
wayfarers home, poorer but wiser. Al
though the boys venture was not a
success financially, they succeeded in
getting the "scents" as we are told
they came in contact with .several
skunks and a coyote and even brought
their pelts back as trophies. Better
stay at home boys, and be sure of
something to eat, than to take any
more wild chases. Wild creatures are
very evasive.
