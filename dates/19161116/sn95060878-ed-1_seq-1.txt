Hon. John M. Hess, former Yuma
attorney, in the October Irrigation Age,
calls the Yuma project a seven billion
dollar oasis, in a lengthy article on
"Irrigation As a Means of Prepared
ness For Defence." Picturing the won
derful possibilities of this Southwes
tern Empire, Mr. Hess says:
Under the direction of Goethals and
his mighty Panama engineers, with
the Ludys, Yarwoods, the Marables,
the Sanguinetti's, the Hodges, and the
countless able men along the river
that know it, there will be placed a
hydro-electric power plant every 12
miles throughout the length of- the 2200
miles of this mighty river and its
branches. These men with this money
will conserve every drop of its 132,000
cubic second feet of maximum flow;
they will reservoir its flood-wave in
the 10,000 box canyons along its moun
tain sides, and run cool and life-giving
to the hungry, waiting desert that has
longed for centuries to give its bless
ings, to its children yet to be; they will
fill the 10QO "desert dry lakes" adja
cent to its mesas, and keep them for
ever replenished, until all the moun
tain desert shall drink from the cloud
mists formed here in its valley bosom,
an the cattle feeding on a thousand
hills shall glad the eyes of man where
today are the bare rocks only; at
each dam they will place their silt pit,
for the enriching of the mesas, and
their boat and ship locks that shall
bear a nation's commerce to a waiting
world, and the waters at the dams
they will harness to the turbine and
the dynamo, creating electric power
for transportation, sending their trol
ley cars for freight and passengers
through every square mile of the coun
try and power for manufacturing all
their raw material into finished prod
ucts into finished articles of com
merce, for lighting the homes and for
developing the mines within 200 miles
of each -hydro-electric dam center,
every twelve miles throughout the ter
ritory 400 miles wide by the full length
of the river, in ten short years from
the time Goethals is done, your re
claimed land will be worth $59,000,000
000. Fifty billions in cash. The des
ert reclaimed is the ideal home of
mankind.
Coninuing, Mr. Hess says: Yes, to
this mighty Laguna project this same
government has voted a niggardly
half-million dollars, and has voted to
the navy four hundred fifty million
dollars and to the army four hundred
seventy mirion dollars, and to the
Mexican punitive expedition one hun
dred thirty-five million dollars. One
billion dollars spent on war in timer;
of profound peace. We are at war with
no nation.

CANTU'S DOMAIN IN PERIL
SAYS AMERICAN ADVENTURER
(Special to the Yuma Daily Examiner.)
CALEXICO, Nov. 15 Edward B.
Brown arrived in the city from San
Diego yesterday and tells a rather
thrilling tale of experiences in Mexico
serving under the banners of various
revolutionists.
He declares that he was with Pan
cho Villa at Agua Prieta when he
captured that city in November, 1915.
As a soldier of fortune and wan
derer, he later served under Zapata
and then threw in his fortunes with
the Legalista faction.
While following the Legalistas, he
was bitten by a particularly venem-
ous Mexican insect, he stated, which
suspended his usefulness as a soldier.
He boarded the boat, San Diego at
Salina Cruz and was brought to San
Diego with a number of refuges.
He declared that at Guaymas he saw
2000 Carranzistas encamped whose
mission is to. enter Lowrr California
and wrest control of it from Col.
Cantu. He says he not only saw these
soudiers, but talked to them as well.
The soldiers claimed, he savs that
there are 2000 additional Carranza
troops at Mazatlan and that a regiment
of these also will be sent into Baja
California.
The only thing delaying the troops,
Brown states, is the lack of boats and
that they are expecting transports at
any time.
The story of the troops at Guaymas
has come to Calexico a number o
times previously.
The last time that it came an off!--cial
statement issued from the offices
of Col. Estuban Cantu, military gov-,
ernor of Lower California, was to the
effect that the troops at Guaymas
were gathered there to escort a new
governor to La Pas, a'tal of the
southern district of Lower California.
