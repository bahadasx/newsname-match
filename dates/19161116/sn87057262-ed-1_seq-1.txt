gains of 502 over his figures in the un
official count were shown for President
Wilson today in complete official pres
idential returns from fifty out of the
fifty-eight counties in California, tab
ulated by the United Press. These
figures tend to confirm the statement
of yesterday that Wilson's minimum
plurality over Hughes when all official
I returns are in, will be between 3,700
and 3,800 unless a vital error Is dis
covered during the next few days in
one of the large counties.
In the fifty counties whose returns
have so far been compiled Hughes has
a total of 157,115 against 169,743 for
Wilson. The same' counties, on the
unofficial count, gave Hughes 156,692
and WHson 168,817. Wilson's lead in
these counties on the official returns
is 502 votes greater than his lead in
the same counties on the unofficial re

The counties which have not yet

today, guarding the life of Samuel Gianola, an Italian, arrested on suspicion of complicity
in the murder of Harry Paul, 28, and Morris Harris, 22, shot down from ambush in the

Three hundred enraged citizens stormed the jail at midnight, attempting to lynch the

Police have been unable to learn the motive for the slaying of Paul and Harris. Both
men were wealthy, being associated in the organization of the Wyandotte Fruit company.
Paul's body was found on Oak street, riddled with bullets. A few yards up the street,
Harris was found lifeless.

IN DEFENSE OF
ADAMSON LAW
Administration Intends to
Fight for Measure Which
Railroads Have Brought
Into Court.
WILL FILE DEMURRER
Claim Will be Made That Law Is Con
stitutional In Answer to
the Plea for an
Injunction.
[By Robert J. Bender. United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.—The ad
ministration is ready to start an
aggressive fight in behalf of the Ad
amson law, now object of concerted
attack by most of the big railways of
the oountry, it was made clear today.
Belief was expressed by high of
ficials that the efforts to enjoin the
operation of the law would fail.
It was suggested that the govern
ment might not confine Its efforts
to defensive tactics, if the hope
tho railways to prevent the operation
of the law should appear likely of
realization.
If the railways tie up the endorse
ment of the A/damson act, the rail
workers are expected to strike. It
Is the sentiment of some of the
president's advisors that the courts
would hWd the railways responsible
for Interference with interstate com
merce in euch oase and would com
pel them to abide .by the provisions of
the act.
This beltef is strengthened by the
administration claim that the Adam
son law primarily Is a measure de
signed to obtain a thorough and
scientific investigation of facts on
which to base final legislation. It is
to be effective only six months, dur
ing the time of the investigation ot
the application of the eight hour
day. It can be extended only thirty
days at the request of the special
commission appointed under It.
By reason of the very nature of
the act, administration men are con
vinced, efforts to enjoin ItS operation
will fall.
On the other hand, it is thought. It
may be possible to enjoin "Interfer
ence" by the rallro&ds with inter
state traffic, as labor leaders were
enjoined in the famous Pullman
Strike of twenty years ago.
Work of formulating the govern
ment's course of action proceeded
rapidly today, under direction of As
sistant Attorney, General E. M. Un
derwood and Solicitor General John
Davis. It appeared likely the. govern
ment would file a demurrer, claim
ing the Adamson law constitutional,
in answer to the railroads' plea for
an injunction restraining its enforce
ment. This would result ln a straight
away fight on the constitutionality
of the act and would serve more
quickly to bring the case before the
supreme court.

desperate onslaughts from the enemy.
Southward, the French lines were
forced slightly to give way from the
tremendous concerted pressure at the S
very base of the angle which recent™®1
British and French gains have thrust,^
into the German lines. The German
gains were insignificant compared to
the prodigal expenditure of men and
ammunition which they expended.
Every instrument of warfare in the
German report was called Into oper
a tion—big guns, small guns, hand
grenades, bombs dropped from aero*
planes, machiae guns, poison gas,
"tear" shells—and the bayonet.
It was General Foch's French

fighting. Wltnin striking distance of
