The arrival of the machinery for
Bogalusa's creamery will arrive
next week and the following week
work will start on installing same.
The machinery is the most modern
and the plant will be owned by M.
L Pearce, proprietor of the Ozone
Ice Company. The creamery will
be a much needed addition to the
city as it is believed that the local
demand will consume the entire
output for several monthl Many
farmers have.announced that they
will secure fine milch cows and at
an early date Bogalusa cap claim

section of the country,

accomplishing that end by attend.
inog the meeting which will be held
ia Franklinton. on Tuesday, Decem*
bar Sth, when this question will b
decided. Owing to the fact that
the success of the fair in the past
has been due largely to the cooper,
ation given by Bogalusa and th
advantages of having the fair her
we have an excellent chance of
curing it for next year. Every
business man who possibly cani
should attend this meetng and set
forth the claims for Bogalusa as
final action will be taken on this
date.
