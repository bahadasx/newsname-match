"Midji" will be sold in paper bags

The new company has adopted Pie
idea of putting its product on the
market in paper bag containers in
preference to a sealed package or box
for the reason that in this form the
purchaser will be a&feured of its fresh
ness and lack of preservation (an
idea which undoubtedly should ap
peal to people with a "sweet tooth"),
a combination which in itself should
recommend the product very strongly.

CITY BASKET
BALL TEAM TO
ORGANIZE SOON
The "Big Bemidg" basket ball team
will be organized soon, probably the
latter part of next week, and a quint
which will compare favorably with
the famous fives of 1913 and 1914
will seen in action. The armory will
be secured for practicing and for
games.
Plans are already being made to
arrange a strong schedule for this
season. The first game will be play
ed the latter part of this month.
The Bemidji team will be strong
and among the players who will try
out for positions are Paul Howe,
captain of the 1914 quint, Glen Peck
and ^acobi*on, guards on the
1H13-14 quints, William Berrlgan,
Remson Bell, Dr W Dicdrich and
"Fuzz" Johnson. Several outside
players may be secured for the team.
Very few rules of basketball have
been changed for the 1916-17 season,
according to the official guides which
have just been issued.
Probably the most important
change is in the ground rules, which
provides* that a 6 by 4 backboard
must be used. It is not sufficient
to paint a rectangle on the wall as
the new rules place the boundary
line of the court three feet from any
portion of a building or spectators'
stand.
"Running up the wall," which has
been popular with many basketball
players, is forbidden and the new
ruling is adopted especially to pre
vent this practice.
The athletic laws governing the of
ficial of the games) and the duties of
captains have also been changed to
some extent but these are classed as
unimportant. Another rule of last
season has been discarded and on a
"jump bail" the players may now tap
the ball and turn and catch it if they
so desire, doing away with the neces
sity of another man entering the play
before the jumper may again get into
action.
The wording of each rule had been
changed to some extent in order that
there will be less danger of misinter
pretation. A few light restrictions
have been defined but no radical
changes made.

OFFICIAL RECOUNT
OFHENNEPlNCOUNTY
BALLOTS IS BEGUN
(By United Press)
Minneapolis, Minn., Nov 16.
With Charles Evan Hughes and
Woodrow Wilson running a neck and
neck race upon unofficial returns for
Minnesota twelve electoral votes,
the official post-mortem and inquest
over Hennepin county's popular votes
began today.
The official recount of the voted
of this county, the largest in the
state, was begun at the county audit
or's office. Great importance being
attached to the figures from this
county, both parties had men pres
ent when the recount was made.
The great element of doubt is the
recount of this county. This county
has the largest vote of any in the
state and it Ys remembered that when
Ramsey (St. Paul) county, the sec
ond largest in the state, and St.
Louis (Duluth) the third largest
county in the state, were officially
canvassed, it resulted in a change in
the figures that netted Wilson 349
in Ramsey and 62 in St Louis. In
Red Lake county, the official count
helped Wilson a net of 38.
Leaders of both parties hope some
mistake can be found in Hennepin
figured), to help their candidates.
Owing to the fact that there was not
only the national and state election,
but also a city election, the count
will proceed slowly, and probably
take four days.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 16.
Fifty out of 58 counties show a net
gain for Wilson of 502 in the offi
cial recount. Figures appear to in
dicate that Wilson's lead over
Hughes will be 3,700 to 3,800.
