Some Stove Questions You
Would Naturally Ask
In the selection of your heating stove surely you will
want to know . if it burns all fuels successfully, if it holds
fire overnight, if it "burns the smoke" if it will last 15 or
20 years. These are logical, sensible questions to ask of
the dealer.
Now for the Answers
Claims without proof arc void. If your selection-is
the Genuine Round Oak Double Burner, all these questions
can be answered in the affirmative, but better Still, we in
vite the opportunity of proving from the stove itself why
this is true.
Remember a quality purchase is always a compliment
to your foresight and ju Jgmcnt.

Emporia, Kansas, Nov. 11.
Six young people from Meade
countv aie enrolled at the Kan
sas Normal School this year. One
is a boy and five are. girls. Meade
county sends morejof its young J
people -away to the institutions
of higher learning j every year.i
The big state teachers school at,
Emporia, which with its annual:
enrollment of 4000 students is
now the largest normal school mi
I the United States, has always
received a large share of the
Meade county students. A large
i percentage of these boys and
girls, experts say, return to their
home counties for their' life
work. Interest in the home
county is kept alive at' the nor
mal by numerous county clubs.
Nearly every county in Kansas
has a normal county club. They
devote themselves to hikes, re j
ceptions, wienie roasts, debates
and the perusal of the county
Daners. The students at the i
normal this year from Meade
county are : Rosa Rhodes, Clara
Perkins, Glen Perkins, Florence
Ross, Lois Perkins, and Neva
Ross.

Protects His Customers
The true merchant the home
merchant seeks at all times to
see that his customers are not
deceived or imposed upon. 'He
learns to know the reliable job
bers and manufacturers and he
deals only with them. He car
ries only standard brands
goods bearing the stamp of hon
esty. By making a study of his
business, by knowing merchan
dise as the mechanic knows steel
and iron, or as the farmer knows
soil and grain and live stock, the
merchant is able to discuss in
telligently with his friends and
neighbors the questions of value,
quality, style and workmanship,
and, by actual tests and compar
isons to explain to the buyer just
why certain brands and makes
will give, greater satisfaction or
greater service to the user. He
is able to show just why an in
ferior article at a cheap price
may be far more expensive than
a good article which costs V a
higher price. The home mer
chant can take up with you the
various methods of manufac
ture. From the great mass of
information at his command, he
can tcjl you how unfair manu
facturers, seeking to profit at
the. expense of the buying pub
lic, send out off-hand goods un
der names almost like the names
and brands used by honest mak
ers how these manufacturers
claim their goods to be of first
quality, whon they are not first
quality at all. Today, there is
substitution in every line of
merchandising goods which to
the ordinary buyer seem to be as
good as any offered on the mar
ket, but which are made to sell,
not for service. The home dealer
knows these things. It is his
business to keep posted. He sees
to i t thai these questionable
makes and brands do not' find a
place in his store. His success
depends on fair dealing. He sees
to it that the buyer gets quality
q uality first quality the
highest that can be had. And
quality is the thing that counts
Cheap stuff, as we all kn6W, is
no good at any price. - u
