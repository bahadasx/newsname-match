New York's New Year's Eve
Is Postponed to New Year's
Hotel and Restaurant Owners Decide to Hold Celebration
on January 1. When Law Will Not Restrict

Praprlatari ol tr.e large hotels yes?

po*ed to celehrate New Year "in some?
what the same rnanner a* has heen cus
tomary to celehrate N'ew Year'a F.re,"
on Monday night, January I, A resolu?
tion to that effect was adopted Bt a
meeting of the executive committee of
the Hotel A?soclatlon of New York
City yesterday.
Tha Society of P.estaurateurs, eom
posed of the large restaurant and
rabaret proprietors, will meet to-dav
at Murray'a, in West Forty-serond

action. John (avanagh, president of
the society, said yesteniay that a com
rnittee of twelve of the leading restau?
rant owners would confer with Mayor
Mitchel prior to the meeting. It was
explained, however, that the viiit to the
Mayor would be merely a matter of
form ai the restaurant owners, bb well
aa the hotel proprietors, reaJized that
the Mayor was powerlesi to grant any
extension of liquor licenses for Sunday
night.
Appeal Made to tha Public
Tha hotel men, following tha adop
tlon of their resolution yesterday.
made an appeal to the public to enter
into the spirit of postponement of fes
tivities and celehrate Monday night.
The state rxcise law permits hotel* to
sell liquor to their guests from 12 to
1 o'clock Monday morfiing, a privilege
which the law does not extend to res?
taurant*. where it cannot he aold until
6 o'clock Monday morning. This, how?
ever, the hotel managers consider en
ALLIED BAZAAR
PROHTSDWINDLE
$700,000 Realized ? First
Reports Put Receipts
at $1,500,000
Shortly after the cloee of tha Allied
Bazaar, which drew .ig crowds daily
to the Grand Central Falace between
June 3 and June 21, it was announeed
that $1,500,000 had heen cleared. Yes?
terday those who had charge of the
bazaar and who did not trouble to
deny the earlier and more roseate es?
timate of the profits, admitted that
only ahout $700,000 had been realized.
The delay in auditing the accounts
has caused rextlessness among some
of those who contributed to tM J*
hef work. Chief among them is Will
iam J. Kohinson. a director in a mo?
tion picture company, which turned
?vor to thc hazaar officials the pro
ceed* from thousands of tlcketa f*>r

basis of receipts of $700,000 h? "*

"Wi' know." he naid yesterday, "that
some unpleasantness has cropped up.
Mr. Kohinson, for instance has threat?
ened to go before the jrrand jury unless
we nubh.?h our flgurc* within a week.
"I am not estimating the figures in
ndvam-e of the au.litors' report, but it
is true that the Boosting of oortain per?
sons not connected with the basaai Ml
been a source of embnrra*sment."
Mr Haight explained that the audit
has been delaye<] because a number of
bazaar wurkcrs went abroad immedi
ti',r,v nftor the close of tha vrnture;
because a considerablo amount nf un
sold goods remains to be disposed of
and because of a mlsunderstamiing
with one of the coop4Tating orgaalta

ality of Law ?Ask
What It Means
Three of the big railroad systems in
( tha Kast the New York Central, the
Pennsylvania and the Krle -and four
other lines in the Wr?t brought euita
yesterday at'acking the Adamson la
as uncon*titutional. The railroads
, asked for Federal lnjunctions restraln
ing I'nited States district attorneys
and members of the four train fltrvlce
brotherhoods from proseruting them
for failure to apply the act to their
pay sehedules on January 1, pending a
ruling by the courts.
The formal papers In similar actions
have already been signed by officers of
the New York, New Haven A Hartford
and soreral of the Southern roads.
Their suit9 will be filed in a day or
hra, Cp to the present sixteen rosd*
have had recourse to the courts for re?
lief.
These suit*, rapidly increaslng In
number. are regarded a* an emphatio
declaration of the railroads' Intention
i to fight the law, In spite of the threat
of the brotherhoods to renew their na
?:on-wide strike order. ? This course
also was clearlv Indicated yesterday in
h statement by Kl;?.ha I.ee, chairman of
the mnnagrrs' committee.
Want to Know Law'a Meanlng
Mr. I.ee said the roads would "falth
fully follow the instruetions of tha
courts," put he explained tim situation
concisely as follows:
"Two questions are involved in the
-*.r?al hy the ratlrords to tha rourts
i*?og light on tho Adamson law: fl)
Is the law constitutional? (2) If it
is constitutional. what does it mean?"
On the other hand, (ieorge H. Sines,
vice-president and chairman of tho
tralaatea'fl brotherhood, declared that
the employes' organizatmtis would act
regardless of the pending suits. Mr.
Sines said that the brotherhoods
might ask the railroads on January l
for the terms they sought before the
law was enacted and use the strike
iveapon if the roads refuse to grant
them amicably.
It was suggested in some quarters
yesterday that Congress might amend
the Adamson law before January 1.
nnd thus avert impending everrtuali
tics. lt a!*o was learned that the
railroad:? probably would resort to
other le^al action to prevent the
operation of the Adamson law if their
present injunction suits fail. That
other nction, it was said, might take
the form of gtockholders' suits.
No time was set for an answer in
the Pennsylvania injunction suit
which was filed in the Diatrict Court
f.f Kastern Pennsylvania. In the
Central and Elifl BBita, however,
Judge Julius M. Mayer n-l I o'clock,
December -'. a* the day for argument.

The principal attaek in the suits is

Prepares for Long War
London. Nov. 16. Kngland and
France have determined upon drastio
food economiea.
The appointment of a food controller,
hy tho British government, was fore*
caat to-day by Walter Runciman,
president of the Board of Trade, in an- ;
nouncing in the House of Commons i
that wider powers will be conferred,
upon the British government to-mor-1
row by an Order in Council dealing
with the food question.
Mr. Runciman said the Food Con-1
troller would have full power over all
departments roi.cerncd in food sup-1
pliea.
The London morning papers devo'.e >
their leading e.litonals to' Mr. Runci- .
man'a statement in the House of Com?
mons. They rccogniie the seriousness '
ot the situation and coneur in the ne- |
cesaity ot the proposed measurer,
which ?ome of them tegret were not J
adopted earlier.
"The Graphic" say?: "Mr. Runci
man'a speech does not leave much
room for that comfortable optimism in
which most of Bfl like to indulge when
| ever wa get go.nl news from the front.
! I'nless the ge#Yral situation were ftti'
I ous the government would fiardly ven
ture upon the drastic proposalu Mi?.
Runciman has otiMined."
"Tho Daily Sketch" expresses the
belief that I.ord M.lner will be the
food dictator.
Prepare far Long War
The speech of Mr. Runciman hail
significuiire, aside from its actual con
text, ns showing that the government is |
looking forward to protracted hostili-1
ties and foresees the necessity of J
timely measures for insuring the na-J
tional food supply.
These measurer, Mr. Runciman ex?
plained, would bfl lemporary, but if
they were found insufficient it m;ght
become necessary to have recourse to
food tteaata.
The speech of the president of the |
Board of Trade was welcomed in all
parts of the house. Sir Kdward Car- I
son, on behalf of the Opposition, and ,
George J. "Wardle, for the Laborites, j
agreedttrTat the HoBBfl was teady to
fgraat the trmot aakad without the for
mality of a bill. ... .
Mr. Runciman, in opening his speech,,
admitted that the time had arrived i
erhafl fhe government must regard the
qilflatiafl of food supplies as a wa*
problem, declaring that the Mrain the,
country would havo to bear next year j
woul.lbe mainly in connection with the
food rupply.
Foes' Situation Worae
He was only able to express the sure
and certain hone that, however tragic
it might be, the iCtrain was still more

Bfl ?aid it was imperativo to cut
down tho luxurious use of sugar, espe?

The excessive consumption ot pota?

London, Not. 15.--The destructlon of
British shipping by German submarines
came up in tho House of Lords for dis?
cussion this afternoon.
Baron Sydenham invit*d th* govern?
ment to make a declaration in the nat?
ure of a "ton for ton" policy in behalf
i of Great Britain and her allies as a re
! ply to "ihe monstroui proeeedings" of ;
i the German submarines. He declared '
! that there was an uneasy feeling in th* |
| country that the aubmarin* menac*;
was more serious than th* authoritiet |
were willing to admit.
Admiral Lord Beresford said that
Great Britain had arrived at a serious
crisis, calling for energy and foresight.,
It was time for plain apeaking, be
taaaa tbe Houae of Commons and the j
newspapers hnd been muzzled by the j
most autocratie government since the I
t.me of Pharaoh.
"Had the blockade been properly *n
forceri from the tirst," he aa?erted, "w?
ahaald not have been facad by this j
submarine menace."
Tho Marquis of Crewe. Lord Pr*?l
djaal of the Council, replying for the
government, said It was useles* to make
such declaration* as Lords Sydenham
and Beresford demandod, without th* -
power to enforco them. The only
raieaa which could speak with influ
e/BCfl now arflra the voices of the cannon j
on the various fionts.
"It is uselesfl," said the Marqui* of ?
Crewe, "to threaten to exact particular)
reparationn iii the terms of peace un?
less we are able to impose thoae terrai ,
by obtaining complete vietory."
The Admiralty, continued tha Lord ,
President, htwd been gingularly aueceafl-'
ful ln tha destruction of enemy subma- I
rines, bift tha difficultUs ln .lealing;
with this menace had increased.
The Karl of Lytton, Civil Lord of the
Admiralty. denied that the fleet had
departed from its traditional policy of
BCflkiag out and destroying the enemy. ;
The subject then was dropped.

London, Nov. 15.?Tha first pha?a
of tha Battle of the Ancre is ended.
Following tho mlghty blow by which
they obtained one of the moat sweep?
ing victoriea in four months, tha
British troopa are consolidating their
new positions and preparing for thfl
still greater elTorts to come. They
made slight advances notlli and
south of the Ancre to-day.
Mean while, the ('erman counter
attaek that had been expected on th?
Ancre was delivered instond against
tha Freneh lines, both r.irth and
south of the Somme, to-day. Thia
fact leads to the conclusion that tha
Germana believed Foch's troops lcaa
able to withatand a heavy assault at
the preaent moment than the trium
phant Britiah.
I'enetrate Preaaoire Village
The German infantry were sent
against the Freneh lines in two great
sections. One beat against the de
fencea in the region of Ablaincourt
and Pressoirc. These attacka were
delivered after three daya of inees
aant bombardment, and lastad the
entire morning and afternoon. The
aole auccess obtained by the attackera
waa tha canJiire ol t% few houses in
the kastern part' of PWs?oire
The Germans made cxtensive uaa
of flaming liquids and tear-produc
ing shells, but assault after asaault
was beaten back by the accurate fira
of the Freneh guns and at the point
of the bayonet, when the attaekera
penetrated aa far as the Freneh
trenches. The Freneh official atate
ment describea the loasea of the Ger?
mans in theae aaaaults aa terriflo.
The other attaek was aimed at tha
Freneh poaitiona gn the sevrn-mile
front from the region of I.ea Boeufa
to a point aouth of Bouehavesnea. At
the price of heavy caaualtles tho
Germana aucceeded ln winning a
foothold in the advanced Freneh
trenches in tha northern and western
outakirts of .St. Pierre Vnast Wood.
Everywhere else the attaeking foreea
were hurled back with greatly re?
duced numbers.
Fall In Main Objecta
Aa an attempt to Inflict a telllng
defeat on tlje Prench and ?o divert
the attention of the British from
their Ancra drive?and ?uch the (ier?
man counter blow I* annumed to hava
been?tha powerful effort againat
Foch'fl linea may be aaid to have
failed completely ln lt? principal ob
jecta.
Enough detalla of the great Ancre
drive are now at hand to get a fairly
eomprehenaiva view of thia movement,
one of the very few ?ueeet?ful big
aurprtae attacka fllnee trench flghting
began. It la not too much ta aay that
the element of flurprlae waa the out
atanding feajture of the battla.
The British frankly admit their
astontshment at the magnltude of
their fluccess and afflrm that it eo.ild
not have been obtained witiiout aur?
priae. Since Monday they have taken
6,(578 prisonera.
BattU In the Fog
The battle began ln the fog and
for hours neither aide knew what !t
had won or lo?t. Out of the mi?t?.
however, ia growing a vietory for the
Engliflh troop* that will loom large
on tho recorda of the Weatern of
Jensive.
For daya the whole German line for
milea had been bathed in ahell. A
fortnight ago the Germana mada ?

Except for aporadic bombardmenU
b/ the Britiah to worry the enemy, and
f'-intfl at other point*, nothing hap?
pened north of tha Ancre. Prince Rup
prccht was evidently eonfiden": that hia
t.rat fear* of atuek in that quarter
were ungrounded.
On Sunday last the Britiflh gun? re
?umed the bombardment of the German
linea ln thia sector, but it waa not until
about 5 o'clock Monday mormrf that
