GRAND CELEBRATION IN

livery Marcher will Carry a Light and an
American Flag.
The announcement was made sever
al days ago that the Bryan volunteer
flro department was badly In need of
funds and that the only feasible way
to raise this needed cash was by hav
ing a-carnlval week. Members of the
flro department announced this morn
ing that a number of merchants and
property owners of the city had signi
fied a willingness to raise the money
by private subscription if they would
iot hold the carnival. The fire de
artmont ha accepted and on tomor
row morning a committee will visit
every merchant and property owner
In the city that can be seen and see
what can be done along this line. The
fire boys are needing funds for their
equipment. A new tire for the -auto
truck must be purchased at once, notes
to the amount of $1,250 will soon be
due on the new auto chemical and
there is no source of revenue other
than public entertainments and out of
the purses of the fire fighters.
When this committee visits you to
morrow it is sincerely hoped that you
will not turn a deaf ear. Under the
present charter the city Is helnless in
Aiding the fire department. The vlo-
umeer nre department of the city of
Bryan Is composed of the most deserv
ing body of men In Texas. You can
not find another little city In the state
of Texas where the firemen have done
what they have In Bryan. These men
have nothing as a recompense for
what they do except for the knowl
edge that when they are called Into
the great beyond they have done
something for their fellow man. and
that It was noble. In the cold, dark
hours of the winter night wo stands
ready at the sound of the gong to pro
tect your business property, who
stands ready at the sound of the gong
to rush through the cold, bleak wind,
facing the snow and sleet, to your
home and rescue your loved one?
None other than the volunteer fire
man. The citizenship of Bryan should
rise en masse and everything these
boys want, give It to them and give It
to them willingly.

To Our Subscribers
We have been trying sincerely to establish a cir
culation department that can be depended upon to
give service. In revising our subscription lists recent
ly no one was cut off for non-payment of subscrip
tion, except when that person had been personally
seen and instructed our representative to discontinue
the paper. '
Each carrier has a typewritten list that he is In
structed to carry with him every day showing tha
name of every person to whom a paper is to be de
livered. Our subscribers will appreciate that it is practi
cally an impossibility to tell a carrier where any on
lives, owing to the fact that the houses are not num
bered. We are using every possible means and effort to
properly serve you, and will ask your cooperation in
view of the existing circumstances, to the extent that
when you see a carier go by without leaving you a
paper, to stop him and ask to see his list that you may
then personally , learn where the weakness is. It is
possible that in some isolated cases in making our
revisions, a name has been unintentionally dropped
And we want to know of these cases. KINDLY AS
SIST US.
