BOND ISSUE CARRIES.
oThe carrying of the Bond issue
for the purpose of building a new
court house for Apache County
is a boom lor bt. 'Johns and
should also be to Apache County
though some think that it will
not be but to those who
are in for improvement it is un
doubtedly the best thing that has
ever happened to us. Many
thought that the Road Bond Issue,
was going to be the worse calam
ity that was ever put ontol a peo
ple, but it proved to be a bless
ing and it has also been the
means of "putting Apache county
on the map. for there are no bet
ter roads, taken as a whole, than
those owned and kept up by our
county. Let us )iope that the
bonds just issued for the purpose
of building a new court house
for-our county will also prove of
lasting benefit and a blessing long
to be remembered by the genera
tions that will follow.
Now that the bonds have car
ried let us build a house that will
be a monument worthy of note
as well as one that will be modern
in every particular.
A. & B. Schuster company are

all as busy as can be filling up
their immense shelving and put
ting things into shape in general.
This store is as up-to-date as
any that you will find in the larg
er cities having every modern
convenience. It isNa credit to the
firm an asset to St. Johns and
Apache County, for it will be the
means of causing others who
might be inclined to build bigger
and better.
Fritz Schuster, the general
manager of 'the store is to be
complimented upon the way in
which he is handling the compa
ny, s affairs, although a young
man he is showing that he has
the ability to handle big things
and is making good with the trust
placed on him.
PREMATURE THANKS.
The thanks of our- contempor
ary, the Hartford Courant, were
premature. Last Tuesday morn
ing under the head of "A Great
Escape" the Courant thus ex
pressed its gratitude to "the
Giver of every good and perfect
gift":
It is an old saying that a great
many things never happen. So,
thank God, it is -with Tegard "to
what would have come upon this
country if Wilson had been re
elected. The misfortunes that
would have followed his blunder
ing course will never be known,
because the United States will be
through with him March 5. The
country has had an escape the
gravity of which cannot be
known, because, as we have said,
the things will not happen. A
man o f high character, who
knows his own mind and is guid
ed by principle rather than short-
minded expediency, will succeed
him. A great day's work by an
enlightened people. It renews
our faith in the people of this
self-governing country.
Later returns must have shaken
the Courant's faith in the people
of this self rgoverning country.

ACADEMY NOTES.
The Snowflake atheletes are
coming over to be defeated by
the S. J. A. boys as badly as we
were beaten at Snowflake. Two
games will be played Saturday
afternoon. Both the first and
second teams promise to play well
matched games. This is one
sport we can all enjoy and all like
to see played. Everyone be on
the grounds by one o'clock so you
will not miss anything. . Gate fee
fifteen cents for all.
There will be an "Equal Rights"
dance given at the Academy Sat
urday night, Nov. 18th. This
promises to be he dance f the
season and is the first opportunity
the ladies have had, this winter,
of exercising their rights of suf
frage. Good music and dancing
and real enjoyment for all.

.Happiness comes not from pow

most other things it is wise to
cultivate the powers of apprecia

music.
"Are you waiting for me
Frank?" Ida said coming into the
room, after spending half an
hour fixing her hat.
"Waiting!" exclaimed- Frank
impatiently. "Oh, no, not wait

"There you have a black eye,
your nose is bruised and your
coat is torn," said Mrs. Gibbons
as LeRoy appeared at the door.
"How many times have I told
you not to play with that bad
beck boy?"
"Now, look here mother," said
LeRoy, "do I look' as if we had
been playing?"
A banquet will be given the
athletes before the dance Satur-j
day evening. We notice a mark
ed change in the attitude of the
girls toward the boys. Don't
worry girls, the Snowflake boys
will be here too, so don't let the
St. Johns fellows get the idea
they are too important. There
may be some other chance for
you to visit the American Hotel
that afternoon.
LooK What's Coming
The time: Sat., Nov. 18, 1916.
The place: St. Johns Academy
Basket Ball Ground.
The event: Two of the Season's
Basket Ball Games St. Johns vs.

For anyone to be absent from
these keen contests will not be in
good keeping with the loyalty to
St. Johns and her educational in
stitution. We have no doubt but
that all lovers of basket ball will
see the participation. A cordial
invitation is extended to those
who are perhaps not admirers of
quickness, strength, and endur
ance of the human mechanism in
order that they will, beyond ques,
tion reluctantly leave the court
wishing the games had been re
peated. Here are the lineups:
