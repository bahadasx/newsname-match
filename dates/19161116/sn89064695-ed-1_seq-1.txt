PRESIDENT
RE-ELEGTION.
'S
Much satisfaction is being ex
pressed generally on account of
President Wilson's re-election, no
doubt because everyone feels that
he has given the country a good
administration.
A few calamity howlers are pre
dicting hard times and they no
doubt would be glad to have tins
occur simply to satisfy their po
litical prejudices.
Conditions will make hard times
if this should occur and even if J,estaolishment
Justice Hughes had been elected
be would not have been able to
control European conditions which
will undoubtedly have a strong
influence with the future condi
tions of this country either for
good or for bad.
One of the greatest surprises of
the recent election was the turn
jag &ver "of tfie'bSnfier""republican"
State of Minnesota into the de
mocratic column.
And another surprise was the
turning over into the republican
party of the banner democratic
county of Stearns. This can he
accounted for onlv by the German
vote which showed itself to be
thoroughly un American.
OQ the night of the election it
was generally conceded in the
Twin Cities that Justice Hughes
had been overwhelmingly elected,
and diappointed democrats who
had retired fully convinced that
the republicans had been victorious
awoke on Wednesday morning to
see by the public press that Presi
dent Wilson had a decidedly good
chance of being elected.
Democrats are iubilent over
President Wilson's election and
many republicans of this state are
equally well pleased.

of recommendations by Secretary
of Agriculture David F. Houston
the "Old Kassan National Monu-
ment," consisting of 38 acres with
in the Tongrass national forest,
Alaska, has just been created by
presidential proclamation. The
tract embrases the deserted Indian
village of Old Kassan, situated on
Prince of Wales Island in soutn
eastern Alaska, about 30 miles
west of the city of Ketchikan.
The village was abandoned by
the Indians 10 years ago. Among
the relics which remain there are
about 50 Indian totem poles and
eight large square buildings, which
represent the best specimens of
Haida architecture existing.
"Kassan" is said to be the In
dian word which means "a pretty
town."
A certain amount of vandalism
by tourists and souvenir hunters
rendered protection essential. The
Smithsonian Institution strongly
endorsed the proposition for the
of a national moun

OBITUARY.
Died at Mankato, Minn., on the
insfc, William Cajune, aged 40
years.
Mr. Crijune was a member of
the White Earth band of Chippe
wa Indians. He leaves a widow
and three children, a mother, four
brothers and live sisters to mourn
his loss.
On Sunday my old friend Frank
Cajune called and informed me of
the family loss, and that the re
miins of his brother bad been
brought to Le Sueur for inter
ment.
He married several years ago a
Miss Skelly whose family for sever
al years have been residents of this
city.
It was my mournful privilege
to call upon the widow, the mother
and the brothers and sisters of the
late Mr. Cajune and to attend both
the preliminary and church funeral
services.
The church services were held
at the Catholic church on Monday,
Nov. Gth, and the interment was
at the Catholic cemetery.
A requiem mass was said for the
soul of the departed, and all the
solemnity of the grand ritual of
the Catholic church was impres
sive in its assurance of peace be
yond and its tenderness for the
mortal body surely was comforting
to the saddened hearts yielding
precious dust back to the bsou
of mothar earth from whence it
came.
A large congregation was gath
ered to honor the dead and to pray
for the soul returning to God.
Mr. Cajune was born at Sunrise
City, Minn., and had been a resi
dent of Southern Minnesota for
over fifteen years.
Many friends will sympathize
with the bereaved ones here and
those in the Chippewa country.

Someone must have had a specu
lative and courageous mind, and
intense faith in climate and pam
"logy. Who ever set out the ap
pie trees did well for they thrived
and fruit came and ripened.
Those who came to Bayfield in
after years to build the town looked
at the apple trees upon the island
and gaining confidence decided up
on an industry that has since made
Ba.\field's apples famous
But for the faith and courage of
the pioneer pamalogist at La
Pointe, people to this cay would
have believed the climate too
severe for apple trees.
And here let me say that Mr.
Stahl of La Pointe, every year
raises quantities of apples of sev
eral varieties, and I saw this from
personal observation for the gen
tleman took me through his or
chard while I was at La Pointe.
Did I say grapes? Looking
back over my manuscript 1 find I
made no mention of these. Well,
there were grapes, and the vines
were trained over a pretty aroor.
Within this arbor was a long
table and flanking it were two
benches, and here Grandpa Oakes
reigned and dreamed. He was an
old man, and making his home
with his son, Chas. H. Oakes, a
local attache of the Fur Co., iu

partment.
"Grandpa," as we all called him,
was feeble of vision and exceeding
ly hard of hearing. There were
live little chaps whe were but
slightly less irreverent towards
age than were the little Hebrews
who taunted Elisha upon the bald
ness of his head.
One upon a time these five ir
reverent little La Pointers entered
sumptiouhly into the garden, not
thorough the gate, but over the
fence at the rear. They roamed
about inspecting growth of the
vegatables and fruit and tasting
them, and then they became de
sirous for grapes. The peered
within and behold, Grandpa was
there. Then they encompassed his
tabernacle and beheld the clusters
everywhere.
And then an impulse seized
them to climb to heights Of
course it was Gus Borup who
thought of this first, and his sug
gestive power was so great that he
influenced the rest easily.
"We clomb" at a point where
we could gaze directly down upon
the crown of Grandpa's skull cap,
we tarried, and studied the ancient
from a point where the center of
his cap was in direct line of vis
ion.
We saw, but he saw not, and
hearing not he wot not of the "evil
spirits" in the air above. We
grew bold and bolder and boldest,
speaking aloud, and "tickled" be
cause of the situation. Wo filled
up with grapes, dropped a few
t'irough interstices upon the table
below, and Grandpa between ab
solution and weak vision, saw
them not. But these little scamps
T-n I ._ i ii i
were cautious enough not to shout
loudly, and merrily in time "we"
withdrew. There now, I've made
a revelation, and since 1 have said
"we,"Imavas well mention by
nnme the other young criminals,
they were the aforesaid Gus
Borup, Charley Oakes, Ohirley
Beaulieu and John DuFort known
also at La Pointe as O jib waince,
and among the Minnesota Chippe
was as Kah-ais i-kah-wi mis i.
They are all gone from this
world, and I only am left to think
over this and other innocent esca
pades.
This is a good point to break off
in narration and with promise of
further tales.
But I cannot forbear mention
that the relation of this little gar
den espisode has awakened mem
ories many of other things done
upon the island recently visited.
They bring smiles and they bring
sadness because voices are hushed,
eyes'closed for aye upon earthly
things, and ears no more hearing
sounds that pleased.
Once upon a time there was an
experiement made at La Pointe in
mining. Four little boys one
Sunday afternoon weie made to
attend Sunday school.
This was the price of "aristo
craty." Rebellion in spirit was
there and evidenced in look if not
in word. The hour of instruction
over, they returned and learned
something, and were taken to see
John DuFort. He had not been
to Sunday school at Mrs. Hull's
little tabernacle, for he belonged
without strings tending to toler
ance ot Presbyterianism to Father
Schulln entirely.

We looked upon John as he lay
in bed but saw not, his face for it
was beneath layers of raw potato
and flour, sedatives for burns.
Iu one corner of a large build
ing was a pile of copper ore, (for
the company had visions,) and
John saw this pile on the after
noon in question and resolved up
on mining by blast. He obtained
powder, laid it under rocks, made
a fuse and lit it. It delayed action
and John approached to see close
ly and then the fuse and powder
acted and John's face was slapped
severely by rock and flame, hence
the clinics and which the other
boys were called to look upon.
We saw, and then had the fourth
commandment rehearsed to us.
John was shown to us a* the
punished breaker or moral and
ecclesiastical law, and we were
told that it was only our Sunday
school that had saved our faces.
As Aunt Maria would have said,
"Mi doog, Mi-doog."
"I'm nao doubtin," as a Scotch
man would say, for undoubtedly
we would have been with John or
he with us, but it is quite possible
that it was .John's lonlimsb that
made him wander, and stumble up
on the ore. More possible is the
theory I now hold that we live
would have been elsewhere than in
the forbidden regions of the ore
containing building, yet who real
ly can tell?
Once upon a time the father of
two of the five "young 'uns" saw
in the possession of an Indian five
fox cubs, these he purchased and
gave to the live boys who made
pets of them. "Evil communica-
