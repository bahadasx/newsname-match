GIRL'S SUIT MAY
SOLVE MYSTERY
Worn by Miss Diemer While
She Was Being Treated
In Sanitarium.
Irdernatieual News Service:
PONTIAC. 111.. Nov. If,. I'pon a
simple, tailored blue walking suit
may depend the solution of the
murder of Miss Christine 1 Meiner,
whose body, with broken neck and
fractured skull. taken from the
Vermilion river here following her
disappearance Oct. 27. Htr father,
mother and sister are under llO.Otnj
bonds pending action by a grand
jury.
The suit was worn by Miss bieincr
while she was being treated at a,
sanitarium. She became obsessed
with the idea that it was contamin
ated and demanded that it be burn
ed. On the night she disappeared
the suit went too. It was not on
her body when it was found. The
theory is advanced by the family
that she went to the river, loo yard
from her home, to destroy the suit
during the night, and was attacked
by some one and slain. Search is
beim; made .for it today, alcm? the j
river Lanks and in the water.
A bloodstained club with hairs
dinging to it may prove the
weapon with which she was killed.
Her brother, Ray, turned it over to
the coroner, explaining he found it
two days after his sister disappeared,
but not knowing she h id been slain,
thought nothing of it until the body
was found. A pair of woman's shoe..
coated with mud such as that of the
river hank, was found on the porch
of the Diemer home. The family
declared the shoes had been in the
basement for a 'long time and re
cently had been brought out and
never worn.
Authorities believe the girl was
slain and her body hidden for sev
eral days before being thrown into
the river. They admit the family
has ready an answer for every ques
tion and that they are baffled. The
outstanding feature is the absolute
lack of a motive, so far as revela
tions thus far have shown.

made that there will be no peace

IMspatche- received here from
Germany. Austria. England, liussia
and Prance tell of the most tremen
dous preparations for years of struu
j;le. The allied nations are follow
ing the lead of th- central powers
in placing food upon a basis of scien
tific distribution.
Now Germany has taken another
step in her system of super organ
ization by extending government
control to all non-military service.
This brings a centralization of ef
fort which makes every man. woman
and child in the empire a unit in
the qiuantie organization whose in-
i
,nistrial and military efficiency has
withstood the
tions arrayed
shocks of the 10 na
agairst the German
allies.
It is expected that the allied coun
tries also will move forward along
the lines of the German idea by ex
tending compulsion to industrial
work.
Apjcal is Iuel.
Field Marshal von Jlindenburg.

has issued an appeal to Chancellor
v on P.ethmann-Holl v eg for a more

ed in all the newspapers on Wed
nesday. The field marshal asks for a
greater production of fats and also
a greater willingnes-? on the part of
the rural communities to give up all
available food supplies for the bene
fit of the industrial workers. In or
der to keep up the efficiency of the
munitions workers, the field mar
shal says, they must be well fed.
