CHARLESTON, \V. Va . Nov. Hi.?I
Both Democrats and Republicans of

from elsewhere who are in Charleston
to take part in conferences, have accepted
the call Issued last nlKht by
Governor llatflcld for an extraordinary .
session of the Legislature in a most |
matter of fact way.
Considerable opposition from Re
publicans from different purts of the'
state developed earlier in the week
when It was the assumption that the J

take such it radical st ep tlio opnosi'

j Republican parly is ruined In West i

the belief that no revolutionary ncts|.

That Thanksgiving bird, the turkey,!
will be a real royal dish this year since
from 35 to 38 cents a pouml will be
charged for Ilia carcass dressed, or 2 a
lo ISO cents on foot. Last year prime
gobblers were selling for :!0 and :S2
cents dressed anil 22 and 25 on foot.
Local meat men are dccluriug that
even at the ndvunee prices, turkey"
will be very.' very scarce.
"Turkeys will be the scarcest in the
history of the city, and consequently
higher." said a local butcher today.
"The only wuy we could place orders
was to guarantee a cent above
the market price on the day of delivery."
said another.
"Turkeys will be unusually scarce.,
but ducks, geese, chickens, and other i
holiday fowls will be about the same
as usual." said one. Generally
the opinion is that with .
the exception of turkeys, the supply of j |
other food stuffs ordinarily looked on .
as particularly belonging to Thanks-11
giving, will be plentiful. Cranberrier ;
are. if anything, tnore plentiful un.l
of a higher grade tban usnal. Fifteen
cents a quart will probably be their
price. The celery crop is good and of
a very high quality- Three bunches
for a quarter, lv the present quotation.
Many of the turkeys which will grace j j
Fairmont tables, will have been ship-'
pod all the way from Texas. Texas is j
now the turkey raising center of the I
l ulled States, the vast plains that j
once grazed long horn steers being utll-1
ized now to graze immense licrdn of I
turkeys.
Pecos county. Texas, is the renter of'
tho Texas turkey industry, and will on ' ?|
Xoveber 18 observe "Turkey Day." A , \
prize will he offered for the finest t
birds and the object is to get the farm- i i

The bones of more than a thousand j
