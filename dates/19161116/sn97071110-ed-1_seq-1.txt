WILSON WINS
HOTCONTEST
PECULIAR PHASE ABOUT VOTE CAST
Oregon Remains Western Beacon Light of
Republican Party Biographical
Sketches of Local Winners
Last Thursday wis a day of great
excitement for those of the nation who
took great Interest in the presidential
race, and that meant practically every
body. A dispatch would eome announc
ing a lead for Hushes, and broad
smiles of encouragement would wreath
the luces of G. O. P. men. Then a
message would bring news of success
for Wilson, and, metaphorically speak
ing, the donkey would bray for joy.
wss late Thursday night, however.
before definite news of President Wil
son s reelection came to Hood Kiver,
Many waited until the receipt of the
Oregonian before the news would be
taken as authentic.
All in all. the race was one of the
most remarkable ever experienced by
the American people. Dope sheets of
politicians were entirely overthrown.
Oregon alone remains the beacon light
of the Republican party on the Pacific
coast. Because of intra state jeal
ousies Washington and California were
given to Wilson. In the eastern states,
where prosperity, more than anywhere
else, abounds, the vote of the people
went lor Hughes. In the middle west,
where the indifferent voter prevails
for the most part, especially on the
issues of the day, Wilson ran his
strongest.
Sinnott, Hawley and McArthur, Ure-
gon's three Republican congressmen,
were all returned by handsome expres
sions of the people. In the district
composed of Hood Kiver and Wasco
counties, the result in the race for sen
atorsthip was peculiarly gratifying to
Hood Kiver people, who elected their
choice for the legislature, Geo. R. Wil
bur, f or the first time Hood Kiver,
n fact eastern Oregon, will have a
woman representative. Mrs. ihomp-
son defeated J. L. Kelly by a narrow
margin. J. E. Anderson was returned
by a large plurality.

district attorneyship, local contests
were not very close.

ar interest at the present time, the

RELIEF IN THE CAR
SHORTAGE IS SEEN
Although officials of sales agencies
were alarmed the latter part of last
week and on Monday, relief in the
acute car shortage situation was in
sight Tuesday. On that day the Apple
Growers Association received 20 re
frigerators, and negotiations were made
for the removal of fruit to Portland by
ordinary box cars. For the heating ef .
apple laden cars, the U.-w. k. a w.
Co. has received here several score of
charcoal heaters.
The car shortsge was the main topic
here the latter part of last week and
Saturday afternoon the board of direc
tors of the Apple Growers Association
took ud the plan of chartering the
steamer Bailey Gatzert and probably a
barge to remove the apples to fort
land. F. S. Kingsbury, representative
of the Relgulator line, was in confer
ence with the board. Monday the plan
of moving the fruit across the Colum
bia by ferry and loading on worm
Bank refrigerator cars was broached.
If plenty of box cars and refrigera
tors are received the use of the river
end the North Bank line will be obviated.
With the increased shipments of ap
ples Tuesday the warehouses were
again thrown open for receipt of cer
tain varieties, and a double line or
loaded wagons was drawn up on Third
street all of Tuesday morning.
The Heilbronner building, tne ware
house of the Butcher spray plant, L.
N. Blowers warehouse and the other
local buildings form annexes to the
storage plants and are fast being filled
with apples.
Mr. Sieg says that accommodations
for 100,000 boxes of fruit have been
arransed for in Portland. Storage can
also be secured at The Dalles.
It ia expected that the warehouses of
the Association can be opened today
for all varieties of apples.
TWO BIG ORCHARD
SALES ARE MADE
Through the agency of C. N. Ravlin
two of the largest cash sales of local
orchard property made in the past
three years have just been closed, the
total consideration of the two deals
reaching 127,000. Through the consum-
mation of one of the deals Ralph Root,
who already owns 120 acres of young
orchards in the Middle Valley, becomes
owner of the 34 acre bearing orcnard
of the Dr. Stanton Allen estate located
on the East Side. Mr. Root, who with
his family has formerly spent the sum
mers here, will make the newly pur
chased place his permanent home.
The other deal involves a w acre
partly bearing tract on the East Side
purchased by C. K. Benton from Mrs.
Mary C. Swanson. The consideration
in the Alien-Koot transrer was tK.uuv,
while Mr. Benton paid $10,000.
The peculiarly gratifying features oi
these deals," says Mr. Ravlin, "come
from the fact that both tracts are
bought by men who are already heavy
holders of local orchard property. It
displays a confidence in the apple in
dustry, and we are looking for a good
movement in apple land witn too open
ing of the next year's season."
Reckers Sells Grapes Here
The larger portion of the supply of
grapes consumed in nooa Kiver mis
fall have been grown by C.W. J. Reck
ers, whose piece ia in iviicKiiBk coumy

Mr. necKers oaa piamea several
acres of the sloping csnyonside along
the White Salmon river to grapes.

duced several tons this season, and be
cause of the scarcity of the product in
other diatricta and locally, the fruit
bas sold extremely well.
Niagaras and Concords from Mr.
Reckers' vineyards have retailed here
throughout the season for eight cents
per pound.
Commercial Club Meeting Adjourned
The regular meeting of the Commer
cial elub scheduled for last Monday
night was adjourned until next Monday
night.
