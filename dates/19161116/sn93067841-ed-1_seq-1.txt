CHAMPION FARMER
OF WILLIAMSBURG.
R B FITCH EXHIBITED REMARKABLE
VARIETY OF FARM AND
GARDEN PRODUCTS.
As a feature of the second annual
Williamsburg County Fair, which
closed here Saturday after four sue- '
cessful days, and for which the highest
award offered by the association
was given, the farm products dis
play of R B Fitch, of the Pergamos
section, deserves special mention, as ,
it not only speaks eloquently for the ,
energy of and thrift of Mr Fitch. ,
but in a great measure goes to show ,
what can be done on a farm in this (
section in the face of adverse con- j
ditions, for many of the products
exhibited were made after the July
storm had destroyed, or serously
damaged, this farmer's first, or ,
main, crops. The following articles j
were produced on Mr Fitch's farm
and exhibited in a special booth at ,
the fair last week:
Corn, four varieties; hay, two va- j ]
rieties; cotton, two varieties of long I,
staple and one of short; ribbon, or j j
sugar cane, sorghum cane; millet, j ]
rice, Apler and Fulghum oats, to- j;
bacco, velvet and soy beans, wheat, I,
rye, sweet potatoes, two varieties; 1
irisn potatoes, peas, iwu vnrituea, | ,
^ peanuts, two varieties; beets, flour
from home-grown wheat, three va-;,
rieties of pepper, including the pi- i
mento; tomatoes, eggs, ham, fig,1
watermelon rind and apple preserves. (
cucumber pickles, black walnuts, sev-!;
eral varieties of canned syrups, <
fruits and vegetables from his farm (
and garden, ferns and flowers. ,
This splendid display was augment- ,
ed by a number of photographs show- ,
ing the growing crops in the fields, (
the home, barns, etc, on the exhib- 1 j
itor's place, also the school house ]
and church which are within a .
- i
* stone's throw of his home. j
Last year there was only one inidvidual
farm exhibit of special
notice, that of the Hon S A Graham. |
This year Mr Graham was unable to j
make a similar showing and, as indicated
by a card on his booth, exhibited
"what was lefter after the'
storm." But his exhibit last year
\
enthused others, for this year there
were five, W 0 Camlin, of Blooming- j
vale, being a close second to Mrf,
Fitch. Next year still larger and'^
more varied exhibits are to be ex-!
t J
pected, for this reporter talked
with a number of farmers who have \
gathered new ideas here, caught the ;
spirit of rejuvenated enthusiasm and 1
went home cocked and primed for J
entering next fall's contest. .,
Mr Fitch is one of this county's ; ]
most progressive and valued citi-1 ]

Governor Orders Investigation
of Abbeville Case.
Columbia, November 6:?Among
the callers at the Governor's office
this afternoon was Solicitor R A
Cooper, of Laurens. After a conference
with Solicitor Cooper, Governor
Manning gave out the following:
statement in reference to the
Abbeville lynching:
"I was out of the State when the
Abbeville lynching occurred. As
soon as I learned of it I called Solicitor
R A Cooper and Sheriff R M
Burts, of Abbeville, to the office and
called on Coroner F W R Nance, of
Abbeville county, to comply with the
law and furnish me with a copy of
the testimony taken at the coroner's
inquest. I found that the Coroner
held an inquest but took no testimony
Solicitor Cooper and Sheriff Burts
came to my office and I requested
them to secure the names of all parties
connected with this affair, those
who took part in the whipping, in
the taking of the negro from the j
jail, in the lynching, and all those
who were at the meeting reported
to have been held on the following ^
Monday. I have requested Solicitor, ^
Cooper and Sheriff Burts to make a ,
comDlete investigation of the whole ,
matter and tret the names of all par- j
ties concerned and to swear out warrants
and arrest them. I intend to j
Jo everything in my power to uphold
the law and let the offenders
know that such acts will not be tolerated,
and those guilty of violating v
the law must suffer for it. I have
requested solicitor Cooper as the
State's representative and Sheriff .
Burts as the highest peace officer in j
the county, to leave no stone un- ^
turned in order to vindicate the law ^
and all the powers of the Governor's j
iffice are at their disposal in bring- j
ing the guilty one to justice." j ,

letter office today from Minneapolis, ^
Minn, as the result of the "petti- j
coat for a dime" fraud, against j
which the postoffice authorities is- i
sued a warning yesterday.
According to the postal authorities,
the fraud consists in that the I
concern sending out the original let-1<
ters promised to send a $4.50 silk! s
petticoat in return for a dime and (
continued circulation of their offer ^
through the medium of each person .
writing five more letters, and as far , <
as persistent search can discover no ; <
one has really received one of these ,
promised petticoats. j
The number of dime "dead let-;
ters" th8t came in at the Washing- :

neapolis make a total of practically; j
200,000 of these letters without a (
return address that have been sent j
to the dead letter office to be open- j j
ed, the dime each contains to be re-1
turned to the sender. j
The receipts of letter? today were i.
10,000 larger than the receipts last11
week, showing that the chain letter |
mail order fraud is spreading. Postal
officials said today that their only
hope of stopping the avalanche of t
letters that have already snowed ^
under the Minneapolis postoffice is
through newspaper warning to the
public. c
