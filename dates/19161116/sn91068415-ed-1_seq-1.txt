FOUR MORE YEARS OF
. DEMOCRACY
Early Friday Morning Edi
tions of The Review Carri
ed the Stdry-The Result
Known Here Before Mid
night Thursday The Af
termath. .
After 60 hours of tireless vigil
around the newspaper office, tele
graph key and telephone stations,
the news was flashed to the world
late Thursday night that' Woodrow
Wilson had been re elected president
of the United States for another four
years. The announcement followed
the statement of ' the Republican
State chairman of California conced
ing the state to Wilson, after it was
seen that no possible report from
the few precincts missing could
change the big lead ef President
Wilson of that state.
Then the newspapers, big and lit
tle, got busy with extras and regu
lar editions that had been held up,
waiting on the fateful news.
The editor of The Review went to
his office in the early hours of the
morning, summoned help and by
daylight had an extra over the city
announcing the news- A rush was
made for the mails and many of the
rural routes were covered the same
morning, reaching some of our subs-
cribers on the routes by 8:30 o'clock, I
m hers not later than 11:30. A few
near by towns were also reached.
It was an exciting time all along
the line, and after it was all over
body and foul felt a great relief, one
being allowed to sleep peacefully
Friday night for the first time since
Monday. In fact out of three nights
the writer got about that many
hours sleep. It was a time which
tried the endurance of the news
paper fraternity especially
The announcemet of the election
was received with great joy by the
democrats and they lediately
gave vent to thur fceliLj which had
most to the oreVking point ""
At five o'clock Thursday after
noon The Review received a mes
sage from the New York-Herald say
ing that with the carrying of Cali
fornia Wilson would t).a elected and
practically predicting his election
The story was caried in ihe regular
edition of The Review and gave the
reader a pretty good idea that Wil
son would be re-elected. The week
before The Review had forecasted
"Wilson's election, the closeness of
the House and that High Point
township would go republican"
which proved to be correct in every
particular.
Vine result of tne ejection is a
victory , for the people lrom a
mocratic standpoint and the republi
cans must admit that Wilson was
eiected without conupt politics, the
aid of Wall street, the invisible al
liances, the hyphenate or any en
tangling influences, that he got his
vote in the main from the west and
the south, leaving out all the great
pivotal states except Ohio. In oth
er words it seems that he got his
strength from the common people.
As the republican party has norm
ally more than a million votes than
the democratic party it is evident
that many independents cast their
lot with Wilson. Of course the vote
of thewomen for the first time had
something to do with it.
Such rock-ribbed republican states
as New Hampshire and California it
was never t nought would go for
Wilson but it was just such changes
that made his re election possiole.
The straw votes of the New Yorii
Herald, the Rexall drug stotes and
other agencies, showed a preponder
ance in favor of the republicans in
California but the result showed ditr
. ferent.
In this state the Democrats seem
to have made a clean sweep of the
Congressional ticket except, in, the
Tenth where the rksult is An douht
now. The legislature and -senate are
overwhelmingly democratic. Bic
kett for Governor received around
50.000 majority and the state-ticket
ran close around these figures.
The constitutional amendments
were carried by a good - majority.
In Guilford county the democrats
made a clean sweep of every office.
Randolph county, went republi-i
can by majorities ranging irom oi j
to 396 and the entire ticket in lee -;
ed. J. D. Gregg js the uew senator
and J. F. Pickett representative.
Davidson county was placed in
the republican column by 200 in
round members.
Jamtstown township went repul
ican by 80 majority. j
I1 7 3 AT in
&
appreciated by that
- Forsyth county remained demo
cratic. -
This takes in all the four counties
surrounding High Point. The full
election returns from counties, states
and nation will be found in another
part of the paper..
The greatest vote ever polled in
state and nation was recorded in the
election and as a result of the tin
usual activities of Bboth parties
several changes in the political t itu-
ation were made. It was the first
time in the history of the country
that a democrat president succeeded
himself.
About all the daily DaDers in the
country announced Hughes tho wih
ner Wednesday morning, even the
staunch democratic organ, the News
and Observer. In Greensboro and
High Point the Public Service Co.
flashed the lights about eleven o'
clock that Hughes was elected. The
signal was FIVil for Hughes and
THREE for Wilson. Thursday
night the same company had toper;
form a similar service but this time
THREE for Wilson.
And they flashed the lights five times
for Hughes, .
But Democratic chairman McCormick
said that wouldn't do;
So the count of ballots in the west kept
steadily on,
And now Wilson and THREE and the
battle is won.

If you like to see people give vent
to their pent up feelings in a good
natured way you should have bpen
in Hrgh Point early Friday morning
and Friday night. -
A little after midnight Thursday.
just about the time those left on the
streets here, were getting readv to
ceieprate Wilsons victory a crowd
came ovef from Greensboro, carry
ing the good news also, and within
a few minutes something was doing .
In les than one hour two hundred
citizens had been aroused from their
beds to the streets to join in the
merry making. Of course about
f everyone in High Point was awake
: i j i i . i r
aiid remained so during the rest of
the night for who could sleep with
so much noise. Automobiles runn
ing here and there blowing their
horns, filled with lusty-lunged boys
and men, cow bells ringing, beating
tin pans,-blowing all kinds of horns
tind hcreeching things, dragging plow
shares tirf buckets, galvanized wash
tubs, ringing the big school bell,
blpwing the huge fire whistle in
couplets of three for three solid .hours,
turning in the fire alarm and cutt
ing up jack-in geneYal did these
200 men and young men from, two
o'clock' until the break of day. And
above, all the din could be heard
"Wilson"-- Wo drow, he's our man."
-"Hurrah for Wilson" and the like.
The racket never ceased until phy
sical exhaustion occurred, Homes
of .well known republicans were
visited and draped in mourning and
excuses made to " get them out of
bed. The store -of Blair-Hoskins
Was draped -and other - innocent
jlsa,ntries indulged iu at the ex
l.qse of tiberepu blicaos. ; So much
for Friday night T "'7 y"T'
Thursday at the noon hour a very
"serious" fuueral occurred at the
plant of the Southern Car Cq .one of
the men act ei as minister, others
as pall bearers, the 'relatives" fol
lowed with crepe on their arms
the body of Hughes was being con
signed to the grtv r while the crowd
chanted a solemn hymn. ; The
"preacher" concluded the services
with
Ashes to ases, dust to dust,
Here we lay Hughes' body to rust.
But Friday night was the real big
time. The word had gone out that
the democrats expected to pull off a
big one and when the magic hour of
7:30 arrived hundreds of people were
on hand to take part in the celebra
tion. The scene of action was at
the South Main street. graded school
building and the line of march was
up Main to the vacant lot D Amed by
the city where the festivities ended.
Four hundred kerosene torches had
been made, requiring a barrel of
waste and 150 galions of oil and
when they were lighted it looked !
like the night raiders were going to
take the town sure enough. Up
tpwa they came carrying these
torches, and shouting a c every step.
A large picture of Wilson adorned a
banner and the people went wild.
The coffin containing the remains
of Hughes followed in the wake.
Arriving at the North Main street
lot there was a barrel of tar burn
ing and this with the four hundred
torches thrown in a heap caused the
flames to leap nearly as high as the
Washington monument. Then the
Hughes caket was consigned to the
flames. Everybody then got happy.
Somencut the pigeon wing around
the bon fire, others a ' war dance
that would make the aborigine sit
up and take notice. f The Wilson
banner was carried round and
round and the crowd cheered, the
band played but the noise of the

crowd was greater than any band
Carter Dalton locked arms with W
