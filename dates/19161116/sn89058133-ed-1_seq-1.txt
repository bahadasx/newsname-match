bank board November 24. The hear

board stated they would like to get

eommiBRions; length of loans; farm
tenentry as affected by credit; farm
development as affected by credit,
and other things that would show the
farm loan needs of the state.

SOMEWHERE IN MEXICO
Dear Editir and Readers: As I
have been in Mexico for a little over
a month, I think it is my duty to write
a few lines to our good little paper,
which I am so glad to get. I take so
much interest in the letters from our
many friends that I thought perhaps
some of the readers would be glad o
hear from a lonely soldier in Mexico,
although there is not much' news that
I can write about. The censorship is
so strict that I am not allowed to give
the name of the place I am stationed.
Although we are in a hostile countrv
we find time to have a few games of
ball. This morning Co. L. 17th In
fantry played Co. M. same regiment,
a game of football. Company L. de
feated Co. M. to the tune of 3 to 0. I
have the honor of playing right half
back on Co. L team, so you know I
was well pleased with , the way the
ga.me went.
Well, as I don't want my letter to
find its way to the waste basket, I
will end my latter with a poem which
I hope you will like, for it is some of
my composing:
"Somewhere In Mexico"
I sit tonight by candle light in my
tent in
Writing to you of Mexico, amid the
mountains s green.
We will make a stand against Villa's
band if Wilson gives the word;
tAnd pluck their scalps from off their
heads like feathers from a bird.
A reckless crew of seventy men com-
pose old Company "L."
And a braver lot of huskies never
fought or tell:
'Till Villa's band no longer stands to
strike terror to the souls.
Of innocent vmnen and children on
which he takes his toll.
But Woodrow, as you perhaps have
learned is strong on "watchful
waiting",
And Villa may die of old age, and on
Hades Lake go skating.
And us troopers sadly one by one will
sleep on some green knoll,
Our spirits pitching camp in Heaven
Where St. Peter calls the roll.

A TRIBUTE OF LVOE
The Death Angel visited our com
mundty last Saturday morning and
claimed for its victim the loving
companion or Malcolm W. Jaquess.
tttbel had been in reasonable eood
health until Tuesday before her death
when she drove to Cookeville and had
sixteen teeth extracted which caused
immediate hemorrhage of the gums,
Medical aid was summoned and the
hemorrhages stopped, but she was
so weakened from the lofcs of blood,
all that loving hands could do failed
ti revive her, and on Saturday morn
ing her ppint took its flight to that
better world. She leaves a dear
mother, four brothers, two sisters, a
'oving husband, two precious child
ren, and a host of relatives and frie
nds to mourn their Ioks.
She was n devout Christian and
lived a life that ceases not at he
grave. She was converted in early
life and Joined the United Baptist
Church.
Her faith in Jesus grew stronger as
she most beautifully exemplified the
true Christian life in ner dealing with
her loved ones and friends.
There is a vacant place in the home
which can never be filled.
The comforting voice of a loving
wife and mother has been stilled
forever. But our loss Is her gain.
Today she is trying the realities
of an unknown world to us.
She is basking in the sweet co
hesion of the heavenly angelic appro
bation in that sweet summer land,
while we have a few more battles to
fight, a few more victories to win,
when we, too, will join the happy
throng.
Cheer up dear husband, mother,
brothers and sisters; Ethel is not
dead but only ; resting and waiting
for you.
She was laid to rest lh the Smith's
Chapel Cemetery Sunday, November
5. 1916.
A loving companion, a faithful mo
ther, and an affectionate sister has
gone; but we will meet ;her when
the mists have cleared away. In this
hour of sadness, to her faithful hus
band, mother, brothers, s:sters, and
dear little children, who in early life
are deprived of a loving mother's
care, we pray that - God our father,
may, through his blessed spirit com
fort their hearts.
