Prize Winning Essays

Herewith are presented two prizewinning
essays, from the pupils of
the schools at Mt. Croghan and Middendorf
respectively. They deal with
live subjects and earn the $1.00 prize
each, awarded by The Advertiser.
MT. CROGHAN COMMUNITY FAIR
By Alwyn RatlifT
The Community Fair was held at
Mt. Croghan on Friday, November
3d. There was much interest taken
in it, and it was splendid for the first
trial.
Friday morning about 9:30 o'clock
a large crowd assembled at the school
Dunning, where all the exhibits were.
Some of the little girls served refreshments
in the morning and about
12:110 o'clock oysters and sandwiches
were served.
There were numbers of nice things
on exhibit, especially patch and fancy
work. Some of the patch work had
been made one hundred years. Much
nice canned fruit, pickle, jelly and
preserves was or display, and some of
the ladies had some splendid cake,
pies, wafers and biscuit.
The farm products were also very
good. Much interest was taken in
poultry and livestock. Some fine
chickens and quite a number of horses,
cows and hogs were on exhibit.
About 2 o'clock Dr. D. W. Daniels,
of Clcmson College, South Carolina,
addressed the people on the subject,
"The Forces that Build a Community."
He gave us much useful information
and advice, and I am sure
all who gave him their attention could
not help but appreciate his speech.
While the judges were making
their decisions the athletes from
Kuby were competing with Mt. Croghan
in the high and broad jumps and
several foot races. These were very
interesting. Ruby won two prizes on
the high jump, while Mt. Croghan
won five on the broad jump and foot
races.
The last event of the day was the
basket ball game between Pageland
and Mt. Croghan. Both sides played
hard, but the Mt. Croghan boys were
a little tired as they had been working
hard in the athletics, so Pageland
won eight scores and Mt. Croatian six.
We were glad to have a number of
visitors from other communities who
seemed to take an interest in our fair
and hope to have them with us next
year.
Having a community fair is one of
he best means by which to build up a [
:ommunity. It makes everybody take 1
liore interest in their things. They
ry to have something better than
;heir neighbor. The ones who win
lecond prize one year will try much
larder for the first the next year.
Our fair was a success this year
ind next year we hope to have a bet,er
one.
Everybody, take an interest in the i
'air. Begin to think about what you
vill put on exhibit next time and let's
nake our fair the best communitv
'air in the county.
dIDDENDORF COMMUNITY FAIR
By Crete Sima
Un the atternon of October 20th a
,hort program was given by the pu- !
>ils of Middendorf school. At the
equest of Miss Alma Perry, princi>al,
Attorney C. L. Ilunley came to
lelp with the organization of a comnunity
fair. He brought with him
Messrs. Paul II. Ileum, editor of The
Chesterfield Advertiser, and W. 11.
'raig, an attorney from Atlanta. Mr.
Iunley gave a very helpful address,
'ollowed by short talks from Messrs.
learn and Craig. After the speakng
the following officers were electsd:
Mr. J. B. Sims, prsident; Mr. L.
). Johnson, vice-president; Miss Alna
G. Perry, secretary and treasurer.
Miss Perry went to work at once
lending out notices on the rural
outes, notifying the people of a fair
o be held Nov. 4th.
Our people responded lavishly,
mining in the products made in the
lome and on the farm, filling a spanous
class room of the school build?g
Among the exhibits made in the
lome were caned goods of all descrip-v
ion, jellies, preserves, pickles, cakes, |
>ies, knitting, crochet, tatting, em-1
irttiflprv nrwl ofltor thintra 1i?a nitmz.*_ 1
>us to mention.
Among the exhibits from the farm
;am? corn, cotton, peas, rye, wheat,
>ats, cotton seed, chufas, peanuts,
mmpkins, citrons, turnips, sugar
:ane, potatoes, etc.
The potted plants, ferns, begonias,
jeraniums, wandering Jew, the cut
lowers, chrysanthemums, geraniums
tnd roses, made a beautiful display.
The judges, Mr. W. J. Tiller end
diss Stella Mims, completed their
vork by noon.
At one-thirty the doors were opned
and a large crowd filled the auditorium,
to listen to the interesting
ind helpful address given by Mr. V.
E. Rector, principal of the Antioch
industrial School. M essrs. W. J. Tiler,
I'aul H. Hearn and Dr. L. H.
Trotti also spoke.
After the speaking the doors to
the exhibit room were opened and
.he room wtu* soon filled by the large
There were visitors here from Bishopville,
Kershaw, Lancaster, Bennettsville,
Cli< Monroe, Wadesboro
and Moreen and they did not hesitate
to pronounce this the best
county fair they had seen. Govern- i
ment experts, Messrs. Elliott and Evans,
and Mrs. Dora Dee Walker and
Miss Moore all agreed that Chester- 1
field County was surpassed only by
the State Fair and that only in
quantity.
Chesterlcld County has demonstrat- ,
ed that she can produce anything under
the sun that is good to eat.
She can dp this a little better than
most any other section of the country
and much easier.
It would be difficult to say what <
was the most surprisingly good, the
four general farm displays, the community
exhibits, the girls' canning
club exhibits or the woman's fancy
work. In all these departments mag- i
nificent showings were made.
Heretofore Mr. F. W. Rivers has 1
taken first prize for best general farm 1
display without very serious opposi
tion. This year, though he out-did 1
himself and had on display 238 different
items produced on his farm, he I
was compelled to take second place, 1
the blue ribbon and the $25 prize going
to Mr. D. T. Watson. He was *
closely followed by Messrs!. T. W.
Gaskins and G. L. Moore. All four i
of these men demonstrated that t
a Chesterfield County farmer can live
at home. I
Mr. Gaskins was preaching good
gospel when he picked up a handful
of soy beans and velvet beans and re- r
marked: "These beans have almost
wiped out my fertilizer bills. I be- \
lieve I can soon quit buying any fertilizer
at all." C
The rivalry between the community
fair exhibits was keen and the race 1
close, Mt. Croghan winning 1st place
over Macedonia by two points, the ?
count being 98 to 100. Middendorf,
with a very creditable showing, came I
third. The prizes were $25.00 for
1st; $10.00 for 2d; $5.00 for 3d. I
The work of the girls' canning
clubs under Miss Stella Minis direc- ( 1
tion, was one of the chief wonders of f
the Fair. These clubs have been or- (
ganized less than one year and the ^
exhibits excited comparisons with the s
State Fair in favor of Chesterfield.
The corn and pig club boys under s
Mr. W. J. Tiller, made very fine showings.
The progress in the corn clubs J
is especially remarkable.
Many people were heard to say 2
they had never before seen so much
fancy work brought together in one J
place. The quality was very high.
The poultry exhibit this year far 2
surpassed anything ever shown here 1
before. It was a revelation to know
that so many farmers are taking an
and admiring crowd. (
The crowd was estimated at from
three to five hundred. Every one was
pleased with the arrangement of the
fair and voted it to be extremely t
good, to be gotten up on so short !
notice.
The people went away with the de- j
termination of making the next com- j '
munity fair a grand success. j r

One of the finest things shown at j.

defeat gracefully and vowed to do
better next year. ^

FAIR NOTES
Mr. T. Ik Smith, of lYgelnnd had
on exhibit at the fair some velvet
bean meal, made by grinding up together
the beans and pods. This is
an experiment that bids well to prove
profitable. This mixture will al?<>u
equal cotton seed meat in nutrient
value and may also he of equal service
as a fert ilizcr.
The exhibit of the Montrose Canning
Co., should prove food for
thought for progressive farmers. This
factory offers a market near at hand
f??r a great variety of vegetables, at
a profitable price. They are already
calling for sweet potatoes in large or
small quantities . Farmers should
give this factory, situated at Montivu?,
near Cheraw ill the encouragement
possible by keeping it well supplied
with such by-products as they
can use.
It seems that a great many people
have latel.v developed a way of kicking
.at the gale-keepers of the Fair
grounds when ihe said keeper is only
obeying the instructions of the managers,
who are also acting in accord
wiin the rules of tin Association.
It seems that when a gate-keeper or
ticket seller tells a prospective patron
of the Fair what his instructions ure
in a given case that wouhl be enough.
At any rate it ought to be understood
that to abuse these men cannot
change the regulations complained of.
The Colored Folks Day at the Fair
this year, as before, was a big day.
There were many creditable exhibits'
in all departments, but the women
probably had the most attractive display.
The cooking of course was
good. The fancy work was surprisI
ingly good. Some very fine pieces
made by children were shown. One
of the novelties that attracted coni
sidcrable attentl>n was a hat made of
pine straw necdlys by Mary Hildroti^^^B H
