FINLAND'S TRADE IN WOOD
Pine Trees Constitute a Means of
Livelihood to the People of
That Country.
The pine trees of Finland are the
gold mines of the country, and really
Its chief trade. Pines and silver
birches flourish on all sides. Every
thing or anything can apparently be
made of birch bark In Finland shoes,
buskets, large and small, salt bottles,
flower vases, even an entire suit of
clothing is hanging up in Helsingfors
museum, manufactured of the silver
birch.
The lakes of Finland, of which there
are five or six thousand, cover about
one-sixth of the country, but these
lakes, rivers and waterways all take
their share in the wood trade. In the
uutumn the trees are felled and left
for the first fall of snow, when they
are dragged two or three, one behind
the other.
By this means (lie trees are con
veyed to the nearest waterway, where
they are stamped with the owner's
mark and rolled upon the ice of lake
or river to await the natural transport
of spring. On they voyage, these sol
diers of the forest, for hundreds of
miles to the coast, till finally, arriving
at such an enormous wood export sta
tion as Kotka, they meet their doom.
On the completion of the floating
season, the stock of logs at Kotka
often amounts to a million. On arriv
al at their destination they are sep
arated and distributed according to
the marks of their respective owners.
Large floating houses await their ar
rival. The steam sawmills are wait
ing for them, the trees as they go In
have half-a-dozen saws run Into them
at once, and out come boards and
planks of various thicknesses and
width, the best of which are sent to
England.
Modest Attitude.
"I assume," said the slightly cynical
person, "that you think it's up to you
to save the country."
"No, sir," replied Senator Sorghum
"I take it for granted that this strong
and resourceful nation will always
save itself. All I ask is to continue
flourishing around among my constltu*
ents and taking the credit."
EXCELLENT TRAIT IS CAUTION
Better to Be Sure Before You Move
Than to Have Occasion for
Vain Regret*.
Caution is the parent of safety. It to
better to use caution in time than re
grets too late. It is better to give the
mind some exercise in consideration
before beginning anew thing, remarks
the Milwaukee Journal. It is wise to
make friends slowly. Some people like
to boast of being "so impulsive," and
think that this should be an acceptable
excuse for many failings. Impulse is
often a good thing, but it needs a long
course of careful training before It
can be safely indulged. First impres
sions are often deceiving. One may
not at first lie attractive in appear
ance, but on further acquaintance,
prove to be admirable in character.
Those who are impulsive in making
professions of friendship are not en
tirely to le depended on to be perma
nent or reliable. Ib giving way to a
strong liking or aversion one often
does injustice. Acquaintance is quite
as likely to show admirable as uulik
able qualities. Often an aversion has
been changed to a deep and true
friendship. And, on the other hand,
some who appear admirable on first
meeting, prove otherwise. Do not
judge hastily on the impulse of a mo
ment. Acts done on the Impulse of
the moment may cause repentance lot
many a year.
Short, and to' the Point.
A book entitled "Coke of Norfolk
and His Friends" gives a picture of an
earlier period of English rural life
when there was more of a feeling of
equality between land owners and their
laborers than exists today, and de
scribes a dinner given at the end of
the sheep-shearing season.
The shortest speech on record gt the
clipping is the following. It came from
a farmer who had been observed mak
ing efforts to rise to his feet, but had
been pulled back by his companions.
Suddenly Coke noticed what was going
on and interfered.
"I see," he said, "that good fellow
has something tt say to us. Pray let
him speak."
The man, thus encouraged, rose
triumphantly to his feet and hammered
on the table. Profound silence at once
reigned through the room, and he de
livered himself as follows:
"Master Coke and gentlemen, what I
wish to say is—if more landlords would
doe as Master OBke he doe, there'd be
less doe as they doe doe!" And amid
thunders of applause he reseated him-
