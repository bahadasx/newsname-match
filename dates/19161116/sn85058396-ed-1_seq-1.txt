Cologne Gazette Declares
Navalism More Oppressive
Than Militarism.
Amsterdam, Nov. 1G. Via London,
9:42 a. m. The Cologne Gazette, com
menting on the British reply to the
American note regarding blacklists,
says:
"Everything remains as before.
England is mistress of the sea and
whoever wants to carry on commerce
can do so only with iier permission
and under her supervision. Is not this
navalism a thousand times nioro com
ploto and more oppressive than any
thing in German militarism which
really does not exist is supposed to
have douoV"
The Gazette especially attacks Vis
count Grqy for mentioning submarlno
warfare as a justification for British
predatory war. "We are treating ves
sels," it says, "exactly in accord with
international law. The fact that we
sink is solely the fault with England
who has marked nearly everything aH
contraband. The Americans empow
ered tho American president to take
strong measures againBt British en
croachment, but Grey appears to think
that there Is no reason to fear that
Mr. Wilson will make use of counter
measures."
SIXTEEN SUITS
AGAINST II. S,
Early Decision by Supreme
Court on Adamson Eight
hour Law to Be Made.
Washington, Nov. 16 Early deci
sion by tho supremo court of one of
the railroad Fuits attacking constitu
tionality of the eight-hour law probab
ly will be sought by the department
of justice. An appeal probably will
bo made in the first case decided in
tho hope that the supreme court may
be able to pass judgment as near as"
possible to January 1, when the law
would become effective if not sus
pended by injunction.
A decision in the highest court
would be binding on all lower federal
courts and might dispose of all oth
er suits. The department's polioy has
not been finally settled, but it was
said today that this course is being
considered and probably would bo fol
lowed. Official notice of the filing of six
teen suits had been received today by
the department but no decision was
reached as to where it would endeav

GERMANS SINK
MAILSTEAMER
British Claim Torpedoing of
Ship Was Outrageous and
Inhuman Act.
London, Nov. 16, 12:47 p. m. The
official press bureau gave out today
the following official British state
ment: "An official report from Berlin says:
'A German submarine sank by a tor
pedo a hostile transport of about 12,
000 tons, eight nautical miles west of
Malta.' "
The British admiralty appends "this
comment:
"The announcement is an obvious
attempt to explain away an outrageous
and inhuman act in torpedoing a mail
steamer without warning. The only
ship sunk in the Mediterranean on
November 6 was the Peninsular and
Oriental mail steamer Arabia, 7,933
tons, sunk without warning about 300
miles east of Malta."

STORY UTTERLY FALSE !H
Survivors Owe Lives to Pre- ;
cautions and Skill of Ger- ;
man Submarine Men. j
Berlin, Wednesday, Nov. 15. By Rl
wireless to The Associated PresB via feil
Sayville, Nov. 16. Assertions that
the German submarine which sank the fll
British ship Rowanmore, on which
there were Beveral Americans, fired ll
upon lifeboats containing members of '
the crew are dismissed as utterly
false in the report in the commander '91
of the submarine, further details of Ml
which became known today. In fact, '11
It is said, the men on the Rowan- jflH
more owe their lives to the precau- 1
tions taken by the Germans and the
skill with which their operations were j fH
carried out. During the 20 minute 11
pursuit of the steamship the submar- I IH
ine's shots were aimed accurately so J
as to eliminate the danger to the 11
crew which was congregated at the j ttH
bow. The Rowanmore was hit ten jjH
times, the last shell disabling the J UH
propeller.
No Shots Fired at Boats.
The submarine ceased firing, the
report continues, immediately It was
noted the Rowanmore had decreased
her speed and abandoned her effort I
to escape. No shots were fired at 'H
the men in the boats. Just before , 'H
she stopped, the Rowanmore hoisted a j H
signal, but it was impossible to read !
it from the submarine, at that time
about 2,000 yards away. Later it was
shown that the signal was "I sur- ;.H
render."
Tho master of the Rowanmore at
tempted to justify his attempt to
escape, the submarine commander re- 'H
ports, by the assertion that he de- ,
sired to gain time to launch boats I
but this pretext was.not accepted.
Later the Rowanmore's captain was '
mado a prisoner of war for attempt- ,
lng to escape and for summoning as- '
sistance by wireless, which speedily
brought np a British destroyer.
Thereupon the Rowanmore was sunk
by a torpedo. jM
