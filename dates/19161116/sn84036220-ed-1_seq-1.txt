LONDON, Nov. 15.— (10:25 p. m.) —
AVaHer Runciman, president of the
board of trade, In parliament today,
outlined the government's proposal
for dealing with the food problem.
The speech of Mr. Runciman had sig
nificance, aside from its actual con
text, as showing that the government
is looking forward to protracted hos
tilities and foresees the necessity of
timely measures for insuring the na
tional food supply bv an etfective or
ganizatiou of national resources in a
similar manner to that adopted in en
emy countries.
Mr. Runciman, in bis speech, an
nounced the imminent appointment of
a food controller with full power over
all departments concerned in food sup
plies and immediate measures to re
prevent waste and the making of largo
profits in potatoes and milk and for
forbidding the milling of pure white
flour. He said also that the govern
ment would ask new powers under
the defense-of-the-realm art to deal
with all attempts to exploit public
necessities.
These measures, Mr. Runciman ex
plained, would be temporary, but if
they were found insufficient it might
become necessary to have recourse
in food tickets.
The speech of the president of tho
board of trade was welcomed in all
party of tho bouse Sir Edward Par
son, on behalf of the opposition, Geo.
.1. Wardle, for the laborites, agreed
that the house was ready to grant tho
power asked without the formality of
a bill.
Mr. Runciman, in opening his
speech, admitted that the time had ar
rived when the government must re
gard the question of food supplies as
a war problem, declaring that the
strain the country would have to bear
next year, would be mainly in con
nection with the food supply. He was
only able to express the sure and eer
tain hope that, however tragic it might
lie, the strain was still more severe
in Germany and Austria.
Dealing with the wheat question,
Mr. Runciman said the government
had taken full advantage of the abun
dant harvests of Canada and Austrn
lia. which had been augmented by an
enormous production in the United
States, but that next year the country
would have to depend to a large ex
tent on Australia. Arrangements with
Australia, he added, were rather a
question of stimulating not production
but transport.
Already a large block of tonnage
bad been requisitioned and was -on
its way to Australia, Mr. Runciman
continued. The transport difficulty
hail been enhanced by the need ot
coming to the assistance of France
and Italy, but the government had tak
en the right step in regarding that
the whole of the entente allied wheat
shipment should he dealt witli b
one requisitioned fleet. He empha
sized the importance of transport and
the absolute necessity of shipping be
ing regarded as serving the national
interests when it was conveying food
to the kingdom.
Mr. Runciman also referred to the
constant difficulty and the anxiety of
satisfying in this respect, the conflict
ing interests of the naval and the mer
chant service, especially considering
the fact that Great Rritain was called
upon to provide not only for its own
needs but those of her allies. He saw
no reason, why, at the end of this
year, the production of new shipping
for tlie preceding six months should
not approach 500,000 tons.

GOVERNMENT PREPARES TO DEFEND
THE ADAMSON EIGHT-HOUR LAW
WASHINGGTON, Nov. 15.—Suits by
railroads attacking the constitutional
ity of the eight-hour railroad law were
begun today in many parts of the
country and the department of jus
tice laid plans to defend them.
No offer has yet been made by the
•■aliroads to settle the question by one
test case. It was stated officially that
Attorney General Gregory has made
no such prdposal to the railroads, and
the department is planning to contest
each suit as it comes up for hearing.

Deutschland Arranges
For Return January 5
NEW LONDON. Conn., Nov.
15. — Eighty negro stevedores
from Baltimore who loaded the
cargo of the German submarine
Deutschland last week have
been ordered to return here on
Jan. 5. it was learned tonight.
While the officials of the East
ern Forwarding company de
clined to offer any explanation
of the order, the belief prevails
that another German submarine
may be expected about that time
or that the Dei.tschland may
make another trip here. Al
though the Deutschland's cargo
was loaded several days ago and
she had provisions for 60 days
on board, the time of her depar
ture still was uncertain at a late
hour. Her crew was given shore
leave tonight.

he did not get the opportunity. Tlie
witching about in the returns made
tlie tiling so uncertain that tlie sit

Wednesday morning and then followed
a series of remarkable turns in the

right up to 9:35 Thursday night. At
that time an Associated Press flush
announced that Wilson had carried
Uaifornia. This meant more than that
Wilson was "leading," for, witli Hie
trend us it hud been all day, it made
the election of the democratic candi
