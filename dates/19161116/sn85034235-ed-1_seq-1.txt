Well built, well dressed, well groom
ed, the man entered the lobby of tho
lypicul New York apartment house.
As he did so he glanced hastily down
the deserted drive, then across the
dead slate colored Hudson to the pearl
and yellow lights • glittering coldly
along the Jersey shore.
Once inside the house he was soon
Inserting his key into the door of bis.
apartments. He stepped into the warm
glow of the drawing-room, where a lit
tle woman, hatted and cloaked for tbe
street, faced him.
In one swift glance she had noted bis
ashen pallor and the deep lines in his
face.
"What Is tbe matter?" she asked
sharply.
"It's all up, Madge," was his reply.
"Impossible!" she gasped.
"It's true," he told her. "Listen!
They may be here tiny minute now.
We haven't time to clear out. Well,
It's me for facing the music. Caught
with the goods!" ho moaned, dropping
lntô a chair.
"You have It with -you?" she ques
tioned angrily.
"Yes, in my pocket," he replied.
"Shall I give it to you?"
"No! Let me think. In heaven's
name, what shall wo do?"
"I wish I had your courage." he mut
tered. "Here it is."
He drew an open case from his pock
et, and the woman uttered a stifled ex
clamation at the sight of the flashing
blue-white diamonds displayed.
He slipped the Jewels into his pocket
and tossed the case to the woman,
who shut it with a click of the spring
lock and put it in her muff, which lay
on a chair.
Then she watched the man go to the
insistent phone and remained rigid,
listening to the ensuing conversation..
"Hello?" *
"Yes. this is Mr. Mortimer."
"Did he give his name?"
"Is he a tall man, brown overcoat,
gray suit, dark mustache?"
He listened eagerly to tho answer,
then, patting his hand over the mouth
piece, turned to his companion and
cried hoarsely:
"He's here! What now?"
"Have him come up. It's the only
thing to do, or he'll come anyway."
Hanging up the receiver, he faced
the woman. Both of them Were gbast-..
ly white. Tbero was a short pause,,
but nu eternity of time, and then a
knock nt the door.
"Come in!" said the man steadily.
The door opened to admit a man
tall, dark and comparatively young.
"Richard Mortimer?" ho asked cur
sorily. Then, noticing the woman for

"This Is my sister," said Mortimer.
"Will you kindly state your name and
your business with me?"
Tho man threw open hi3 coat, dis
closing a police-detective badge.
"My name is Burns," bo said quietly.
"And I guess you know what I waut
of you, all right, all right. You didn't
quite get away with that little jewel
stunt of yours, after all.
"No," ho added as Mortimer started
to speak. "I've traced the thief here to
these apartments, and the best thing
you can do is to come right along with
me now, without any fuss."
"I don't know what you're driving
at." said Mortimer sullenly. Then as
the man moved toward him he cried
threateningly:
■qTou can't take me by force, yon
know, and if you're looking for a fight
I'll"—
Burns sneered.
"The old days of knocking a man
down and dragging him off to the po
lice station are over. Gone are the
time»; for bloodshed and blows In the
taking of a criminal.

"People realize more the importance
ot that little element hi mankind that
we call, in wnnt of a better name, the
conscience!
"You're guilty, and you know it!
You may make a getaway now, but
the world isn't big enough to hold you
and your guilt. Sooner or later you
must give yourself uç to the Inexor
able law. You can't help it."
"IIow do you know he Is guilty?"
asked the woman, speaking for the
first time since the entrance of the de
tective.
"If he is be will tell me so of his
awn free will. Here!" and Burns teas
ed on the table ue&r by a pair of hand
2 uffs.
The chill steel fell on the wood with
an ominous clank.
"Sit down," said Burns gently to the
l>air whoso fascinated gaze was fixed
nn the grim thing on the table.
"For tho guilty person in this room
will eventually wear those handcuff#—
by free wllL There is absolutely no
escaper* «
Bums, watching, saw a swift, under
standing glance pass between brother
and sister, yet the true meaning of that
glance he could not fathom, so blankly
expressionless were their faces.
Then Mortimer spoke defiantly.
"What's your game?" be asked. "Do
you expect to gain anything by invad
ing my rooms and chucking a pair of
handcuffs on the table In that spectac
ular fashion?"
"I stay right here till something hap
pens." auswered the detective, "if I'm
still here for breakfast tomorrow
morning. So take your time, for you
may be 'doing' it before long!"
lie smiled and offered Mortimer a
cigarette.
The latter took one »and lit It with
the match shaking visibly.
Then he strolled over to the window
with an effort of nonchalance that did
not deceive the big man watching him
so closely.
Apparently the woman was not mis
led by her brother's iir of careless
ness, and if Burns had observed her
then he would have seen a look of con
tempt in the fever bright eyes resting
on Mortimer.
This expression was engulfed in one
of almost painful anxiety, however, as
she saw her brother turn sharply and
start toward the motionless detective
In the manner of one whose mind was
made tip.
The eyes of the two pen were fixed
on each other—Mortimer had crossed
to Burns and opened his mouth to
speak—when a sound shattered the si
lence. -
The sound of steel striking Wood!
The men turned and, cptechless with
astonishment, saw the quiet little wo
man drawing the handcuffs across the
tabic to her with Blender, bine veined
bands.
For a second she hesitated, horror
visible on her face, almost recoiling.
Then in the hush she slipped the
handcuffs on her hand3, that seemed
much too frail for their cold, merciless
burden.
■ Then to the detective she said calmly:
*"I am ready."
Burns could hardly conceal his
amazement
"The Jewels?" he asked briefly.
Her answer was to motion toward
her muff.
Burns plckèd It up and drew out a
heavy little jewel case, tight shut by a
snap lock.
He slipped It in his pocket with a
satisfied air. ...
r .. "Thank you, madam. Will yon come
with me?" he said, turning to tbe door.
She' took a faltering step toward her
brother and said, her courage suddenly
breaking down:
"Can yon ever forgive me, Richard?
I have brought nothing bat sorrow
upon you. If only I could have spared
/you this! Ah, what a fool I've been!
And now it is goodby!"
She turned to Burns, and her brother
rushing forward, threw himself before
tbe door to block their way.
"Yon shall not take her!" he cried at
Burns furiously.
Then to her. in pleading, broken
tones:
"Madge—Madge!"
"Hush," she said in reply, with a
certain grave, sweet dignity. "The sin
is mine, and mine must of necessity
be the punishment. No, do not kiss
me, even in farewell. By my own act
I have brought it on me and now 1
am an outcast"
When Bums and his prisoner were
about to get Into a waiting cab, she
seemed weak, but when Bums at
tempted to aid her in climbing Into the
conveyance she refused his proffer
courteously enough, though she shud
dered at his touch.
The drive to headquarters was ac
complished in silence.
Burns was full of speculations con
cerning the woman nt his side.
The light touched her pale face and
lie noted with unaccustomed pity her
appearance and extreme frailty.
Arrived nt their destination. Bums
went in to inform his chief of the ar
rest, leaving the woman in nn outer
room, guarded by a policeman.
"Well?" asked his superior briefly.
"Report on the Malden Lane Jewelry
case," he answered curtly.
"You served the warrant?" was the
next question.
"No, but"—
"But what?" impatiently.
"I worked the old gag of throwing
the handcuffs down and trying tbe
'your conscience will got you' trick."
"What do yon menn?" quickly.
As Burns explained the chief's face
grew more and more grave.
t"The woman put the bracelets on
herself?" he asked Incredulously when
Bums reached that part of his story.
"Yes," answered tho subordinate one,
filled with visible pride at his success.
"I brought her with me."
"Where's (he—what do yon call him
—brother?"
"Wo left him there."
"What! You left him there? Oh, you
flathead, you"—
It was now Bums' turn to demand
abruptly:
"What do you mean?"
"What I said. Did yon get those
diamonds f'
In answer, Bums handed him the
case. He took it, tried the catch, and
failing to open it, shook the box close
to his ear.
Then he dropped it with a look of
disgust
"There is nothing In that case. Burns,"
He said sternly.
"Nothing?" was Bums' horrified ex
clamation.
"Exactly! Now, Burns, how long have
you been in the service?" the chief de
manded.
"Six years, sir," was the reply, given
very humbly.
"Six years! Well, no one would ever

baggage and booty, eh?"
Burns started to speak, but was fore
stalled.
"We'll just cut out the excuses," he
was told firmly. "The next time re
member to forget all this psychology
stuff, and don't wait for your deeper
ate criminal to capture himself, but the
good, old, strong arm dope and deliver
the goods if you have to hit your man
on the head, and likewise break an
arm, or a leg or so, to do It Nov»
bring that woman In here!"
Bums, shamefaced, but only half con
vinced of his mistake, went out return
Ing with the prisoner.
The chief looked at her sharply.
"Wliat is your name?" he asked her
"Madge Ryan." was the calm reply.
Her air of quiet sadness had dropped
from her like a cloak, and she tossed
her head with something very near to
bravado.
"You are not the sister of the man
who calls himself Mortimer?"
Again ali ttie defiant movement of the
head. This time expressing negation.
Then rang the Impulsive rollicking
laugh of the street gamin, after which
she spoke.
"Would I wear these for a brother?"
she saucily inquired, holding out her
manacled hands. "Not me!" she added
with conviction.
"Of course it was the man who
pinched and got off with the Jewels."
remarked the chief.
Thon turning to the crestfallen Bums
he added. "Yon see?"
Bums did not see. and the air of one
who clutches at a last forlorn hope ho
muttered something about "accessoT."
"Don't be an utter Idiot, Bums." said
the older man. "Unlock those 'caffs."
Burns without a word obeyed.
"You may go," the triumphant "Bis
ter" of Mr. Mortimer was told, "and I
trust that the next time wo meet we
may be able to detain you for a little
visit in a nice, cozy cell."
"Thank you for your kind wishes,"
she toid him audaciously, and turning
to Burns, she added:
"I do hope your conscience won't
worry you too much, Mr. Bums."
Then, with a cheery "Good evening
gentlemen," she walked out smartly.
Tho two men watched her go In
silence. Then Bums turned and said,
with much feeling:
"Well, I'll be darned!"
"You ought to be," said his chief
grimly, "for of all the pinhead plays I
ever saw this"—
The chiefs head snapped up sud^„
ly with an Idea.
"Hold on!" he said between shut
teeth. "We've still a chance.
"This guy up on the drive may be
slow in making a getaway and wo may
beat him to it before his wife returns
to tip him off. So hustle up there."
Bums broke all speed limits in his
wild taxi ride to the uptown apartment
but when the door was opened to his
loud official knock the same small
woman faced him with a smile that
goaded him to madness.
That smile was his answer.
"How'd you happen to get here
first?" he snapped viciously.
"I—I was in a hurry," she answered
sweotly.
"Where's—where's be gone?" he
blurted In mad rage.
"Suppose you find out That's what
detectives are for," she suggested, and
calmly slammed the heavy door In his
face.
Outside on the deserted drive, how
ever, all that Detective Bums found
was a motor or two flying homeward,
and in the distance the dead, slate
colored surface of the Hudson reflect
ing the glittering pearl and yellow
lights of the Jersey shore.
NATIONAL PARK
HIGHWAY OPEN
Short Line Connection to tho
Pacific Coast.
ENTERS THE YELLOWSTONE.
The Roadway la Termed the Salt Lake
Yellowstone Highway and Connecta
With the Lincoln Highway, Midland
Trail and Pike's Route to the Pacifie
Comet—Built on a Wator Grade.
A direct, short line connection, term
ed the Salt Lake-Yellowstone highway,
betweeu the Lincoln highway, Midland
trail and Pike's route to the Pacific
coast, at Salt Lake City and Ogden,
Utah, the Yellowstone National park
and all points In northwestern United
States. Is now open to uuto traffic.
The highway is built on a water
grade and passes betweeu the Wasatch
range and tbe Great Salt lake in Utah,
northerly through the Cache, Malad
and Bear lake valleys iu Idaho, to
Pocatello, Ida. The Idaho-Pacific or
Oregon trail branches at this point
northwesterly through the watershed
of the Snake and Columbia rivers to
Spokane, Seattle and coast poiuts.
From Pocatello north to Yellowstone
park the highway traverses tbe upper
Snake river valley on tbe same water
grade over the Captain Bonneville trail
to a point near the western Ixmler of
the purk and then skirts the park to
the western entrance at Yellowstouo.
Mont
Approximately $5,000,000 has been
spent in the construction of the high
way. A larger number of small road
associations have been working for the
past eight years toward its comple
tion. Several years ago it has desig
nated a part of a joint system of state
highways by the highway commissions
of Utah and Idaho and the major part
of the construction work achieved with
6tate and county aid. Early in 1910
these smaller organizations met with
the county commissioners along the
route and the two state highway com
missions and formed the Utah-Idaho
Yellowstone Highway association fee
the state purpose of completing a few
unfinished sections, doing general re
pair work, shortening the route in sev
eral localities, making the highway
from the Great Salt lake to Yellow
stone park first class and continuous
for use .this year and maintaining and
patrolling It throughout the season.
The Salt Lake-Yellowstone highway
not only furnishes an outlet for park
bound traffic of the Lincoln highway
Pike's peak route and Midland trail
from California and eastern United
States at Salt Lake and Ogden and for
traffic off the northern route into tbe
park and out of the Yellowstone en
trance bound for the northwest
(branching at Pocatello, Ida.) and Cali
fornia and eastern points via Ogden
and Salt Lake, but it is the only di
rect north and south connection be
tween these central western and north
ern routes In the Rocky mountain re
gion.
All of the beautiful scenic mountain
ous sections of Utah and Idaho lying
contiguous to the Yellowstone National
park are reached by this main highway
and auxiliaries.
It also serves as the main trunk high
way and basis of a general scheme of
connecting county road systems in the
seventeen counties of the two states
along the route.
NATIONAL ROAD CONGRESS.
A. A. A. Chairmen Says Time Is Ripe
For Meet at Washington.
"Unquestionably the time has arrived
tor a great national road congress to
be held once a year iu the national
capital under federal government di
rection." asserts George C. Diehl, chair
man of the good roads board of tho
American Automobile association.
"This gathering In Washington
would be under the auspices of the
United States office of public roads and
rural engineering of the department of
agriculture, and the event could be
made comprehensive In its scope.
There could he a complete exhibit of
road machinery and road materials;
there could bo sample construction of
various kinds of highways; road
schools could he conducted for state,
county and town engineers, and va
rious technical phases of the work
could be set forth I>y trained experts.
"Then there would come the inter
related phases of toad travel and road
transportation. Undoubtedly the de
partment of the interior, because of its
national parks, would set forth the
scenic attractions which are under gov
ernment supervision. Various states
would bo given opportunity of adver
tising their attractions All around,
an assemblage could be brought about
which would prove exceedingly effec
tive." _____
A Boomerang.
That bad roads constitute a strong
argument for good roads Is Illustrated
by tlie following item from the Mound
City (Kan.) Sentinel: "C. A. Stites of
Farliu ville, in Linn county. Kan., call

to rock roads, and only sixteen at
tended. In a published statement why
the crowd was so small Mr. Stites
stated that it was 'on account or the
rain and bad roads.' "
DIRT ROADS PROBLEM.
Proper Drainage and Systematic Main

All through the central states tbert
seems to be at present nn unexpected
interest in earth roads, and there is I
widespread desire to have an author!

engineers are not willing to make anj
statements for fear of being misundee

gineer of the Illinois state highway de

repeated question as follows: "Th*

of the other types. The use of the
road in a wet and softened condltkm
is what causes the trouble. Under the
conditions where the earth road is a
suitable type its total cost for con
struction and maintenance Is less thae
that of any other type. In dry weather
and when it Is not too dusty the prop
erly constructed and maintained earth
road is by far more pleasant and more
satisfactory to travel upon than any
other road. With neglected mainte
nance, however, no other type of road
can go to pieces and become impass
able so quickly as an earth road, nor,
ore the .other hand^can any other type
be brought to a satisfactory conditio*
for travel so quickly and so cheaply
after having been Impassable. Fron»
these peculiar features it will be noted
that practically the entire probluu*
with earth roads is their proper dral li
age and systematic maintenance. The
opportunity for bettering our road con
ditions by properly Improving the
earth roads is almost beyond our im
agination."
THE GOOD ROADS BILL
Authorizes Expenditure by Govern
ment of $85,000,000 in Five Years.
The good roads bill recently passed
by congress aud signed by President
Wilson authorizes the expenditure of
$85,000,000 in five years by the federal
government This marks the beginning
of active co-operation between tbe na*
tlonal government and the states In
highway improvements in a country
wide program.
The condition attached to the expen
diture of the government appropriation
Is that the states shall expend nn
amount similar to that apportioned to
them for the Indic ated Improvement.
The bill provides that in addition to
the money to be spent in co-operation
with (he states $i0,009,000 shall l>e
provided for roads In federal forest re
serves. to be spent at the rate of $1,
000,000 a year for ten years.
The co-operative plan Is said to have
sprung from the combined energies of
tbe American Association of State
Highway Officials and the American
Automobile association. The hill is an
amalgamation of what was known ns
the Shackleford bill of the house and
the Bankhead hill of the senate.

five years among the rorty-eight states
