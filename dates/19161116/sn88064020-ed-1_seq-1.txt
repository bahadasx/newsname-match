BOARD TO COME HEIFE
The special commission of navy

vestigated, and will arrive in South- ki
ern California November 24.

pare a report to be submitted at the V

sirability and avisability of establish- at
ing an additional navy yard or naval al
station on the Pacific coast. If the A
commission recommends such a sta
tion, it is required to recommend a
site and estimate the cost of estab
lishment and maintenance. Study of
the Atlantic coast south of Hatteras,
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and 01
the Caribbean Sea also was directed at
"for the proper naval defense for that of
portion of the country."
In addition the commission is to re

LOCAL DESIGNER WINS CREDIT.
The Historis Pageant which ap
peared before the Grand Stand at The
National Farm and Live Stock Show
on Tuesday evening was a grand suc
cess and especially so from an artis- r
tic standpoint. Many complimentary
expressions could be heard from the
crowd regarding the beauty of the
Bfloats and we are proud to state that
Sour townsman, Orris Davieson. was
the designer of this Historic Pageant.
He has been working patiently for
the past two weeks seeing their con
struction. In all there were eight
een floats and had it not been for the
donations received for the construe- u
tion of these floats the cost would
have exceeded three thousand dollars. 1
tAdditional credit is also due Mr. Da
|davieson for the fact that this was his
first attempt at this kind of work and
that the Coats were constructed in
less than two weeks' time.
t

Ernest Towahill and Jesse John

A LOCAL INVENTOR
One of the coming young men is
Mr. Loutis J. Blrune, the son of I.
BIrune. of Belleville street. Young
Louis Brune has been very active in
the last year or so in experimenting
with inventions and has finally com
pleted a window sash mechanism
that has been highly complimented
by Popular Mechanic's l)epartment
relatlie to inventions. Another one
of the young chap's inventions is a
burglar alarm and window latch com
bined, but the one of his inventions
that he has already applied for a
patent is known as the Brune clasp
holder for the ordinary everyday flat
iron. This invention does away en
tirely with the old and time-honored
kitchen rag which every woman uses.
With this invention this old rag may
be discarded and the Brune Iron
clasp holder will take its place. Mr.
Brune has already received some
flattering offers for this invention.
lie has decided to put it on the mar
ket himself.
