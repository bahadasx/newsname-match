Thut councllmen are not exempt
from their own medicine was demon
strated last evening when the entire
council voted to require Councilman
Kll to put in a concrete walk In front
of his property on Garden street be
tween Alta. and Court. The peculiar
thing about it was that Councilman

motion.
However, Councilman EH was not
singled out The council had just pre.
vlouHly voted to require P. D. Tull
of Spokane to replace the old wooden
walks along the Tull property In
"Chinatown'' with concrete walks and
to do It forthwith. The motion for
new walks along the Ell and Max
puer property followed.

the petition of James If. Sturgis and
others for two crosswalks on Monroe

contractors for the building of sev
eal concrete crosswalks In various
parts of the city. The bid of o. R.
O'Melveny, 14.7 cents per square

an automobile to be used as a fire

furnish a Reo for $500. Mayor Bet

NEW YORK, Nov. 16. History's greatest industrial strug

dollars of capital, employing seven million persons. It pro

voritism to labor.
The railroads are rushing preparations to tvrevent th n.
forcement of the Adamson law. More suits coverinir all Hiim
and all districts will be filed within ten days.
Railroad brotherhoods are ioinin

troduction of an eight hour day In alt
Industries, contemplating strikes and
force the employers to surrender.
The railway managers' conference
have adjourned. They were unable
