E0IT0RIAL COMMENT.
Ml !
Wm. Culver, aged 100, voted for
Wilson in Nelson county.
One of the President's most trouble
some problems now is to take care of
the "lame ducks."
Every time a Democrat eats a Cali
fornia orange this winter, bet you he
will smile with pleasure.
Republicans are claiming that one
of the Idaho electors is ineligible, be
ing a member of the legislature.
Let us hope that Congressman Jcan
nctte Rankin will not interfere with
business in the House by wearing ex
tremely stylish clothes.
With prospects bright for $8 round
for Christian, county's 30,000,000
pound tobacco crop, many an automo
bile mortgage will be paid on".
Some of our Republican sports lost
money by betting on the election after
it was over. Many Republican vic
tories have been won in the count,
but not this time.
Dr. C. H. Todd, who died at
' Owcnshoro this week, was a gallant
Confederate siimeon and one of
Kentucky's leadincr physicians. He
was vice president of the State Medi
cal Society when it met herein 1876
and was later president.
Many world rulers have cabled
nngratulations to President Wilson,
ut he is giving Mr. Hughes tho place
of honor by waiting for his congratu
lations before giving out any. The
Judge is keeping up his reputation of
failing to connect.
Mrs-. Lucy-G. Saylor, at Blooming-
tort, 111., will be married next week
to Dr. Wm. Miller, who has just
served 12 years for the murder of
her husband. Mrs. Saylor herself
starved three years and has waited
nine years for him to get out.
Washington is said to be much ex
cited over the coming of Miss Jean
nette Rankin, Congressman from
Montana. She is a Republican, but
there are plenty of Democratic bache
lors and she may arrange a pair
before Congress meets a year hence
Judne Robt. W. Bingham, of Louis
ville, and Mrs. Henry M. Flagler, of
New York, were married yesterday,
The ages of both were given as 47
and the bride's wealth is estimated at
$70,000,000. Judge Bingham has
three children.
The railroads in the eastern part of
the United States announce their pur
pose to obey the order of Interstate
Commerce Commissioner McChord,
that thev return immediately to the
other roads all freight cars in their
nossession in excess of 100 per cent
of their actual equipment.

PROBE TO BE THOROUGH
Election of New and Watson
and Sutherland to Be Giv
en Particular Attention.
Washington, Nov. 15. Definite
plans were laid by administration
adcrs for having the senate begin an
investigation as soon as congress con
venes of tho use of money in the last
presidential campaign.
As outlined by officials the investi
gation will be very thorough and will
include the cross examination of
wealthy men supposed to have made
campaign contributions as well as of
the men in charge of the spending of
money raised for the campaign.
Evidence is being gathered upon
which to base contests in the election
of Harry S. New and James E. Wat
son as senators from Indiana and Rep
resentative Howard Sutherland as
senator in West Virginia.

At TheJteguIar Meeting of
The Coramissjpners
Tuesday.
Tha Board of City Commissioners i
met Tuesday morning with Mayor R.
T. Stowe presiding. There was but
little business on hand except the
hearing of a few complaints from par
ties whose assessment lists were rais
ed by the assessor. These were heard
and the matters left open for investi
gation. Commissioner Wicks sub
mitted plans for a work shed to be
built on the lot in the rear of the
workhouse, to be used as a work
room for for the prisoners in bad
weather. It would be large enough
to be used for breaking rock and one
end of it would contain additional
stalls for the teams and room to store
the wagons and street machinery.
Commissioner Wicks was authorized
to secure bids on the work, estimated
to cost about $1,000.

many changes loday but tonight stood

nothing in the course of the day to

BIG DRIVE ON
WEST FRONT
This Time It Is The British
Instead of the Demo
crats. PRISONER TOLL IS 5,000
Austro-Germans ' Gain Suc
cesses Over Rumanians
and Russians.
London, Nov. 15. The British
drive begun early Monday morning
amid fog and rain in the regfon of
Ancrc river in France has netted
them another village Beaucourt on
the north bank of the Ancre. The
capture of this village makes three
that have fallen into British hands
since the advance began, the other
two being Beaumont-Hamel and St,
Pierre Divion. There is no indica
tion that the offensive lias ceased at
any point along the five mile front.
In the drive the British thus far
have taken more than 5,000 Germans
prisoners and, according to the latest
report, more captives are being
brought in. Aside from the gains in
the Ancre region, the British also
have made an advance to the east of
Butte de Warlencourt about three
miles southeast of the important tpwn
of Bapaume.
To the south of the Sommc the Ger
mans are busily engaged ip shelling
French positions in the region of
Pressoire and on the sector of Biach-es-La-Maisonnette
with the French
vigorously replying. On tho remain
der of the front only bombardments
occurred.
WIN IN TRANSYLVANIA.
With comparative quiet still reign
ing on the Russian and Austro-Italian
fronts, the Rumanian and Macedon
ian theaters continue the local points
of interest. The Austrians near Or
sova and the junction of the Austro-
Rumanian and Austro-Scrbian fron
tiers have cleared the right bank of
the Danube of Rumanians, a victory
which probably means a lessening of
the impediments the Rumanians have
placed upon the navigation of the
river m this region. Up in the north
the Russians have been compelled to
retire from the Gyergio mountains to
the Rumanian frontier.
The situation in Dobrudja still re
mains to be clarified.
OPEN SEASON
IS NOW ON
Fields Full of Hunters and
Sport Expected to be
Fine on Start.
The open season for hunting small ,
game began yesterday and it will be j
lawful to shoot quail, rabbits audi
squirrels until Jan. 1, in Kentucky.
Several changes have been made in ,
the huntinrr laws this vear. most i
noticeable of which is the bair- limit of
twelve birds per day for each hunter.
Another change is the one made in
the United States Federal laws gov
erning the shooting of migratory
birds, so that Kentucky hunters may
shoot wild duck, geese and snipe at
this season of the year.
Tho Federal laws formerly irave"
nunters m this state an open season
for hunting these birds at a timo
when no geese or ducks were in the
state. Ducks and gceso may now be
shot until January 15, but the open
season on snipe closes December 15.
Every hunter, unless he be huntine
on his own land or the land of neigh
bors, must have a hunting licenseand
must carry it with him when ho goes
in tho field. Game wardens have
; been nstructed to enforce tho license
law and will be huntintr hunters whn
seek to evado this law. Licenses
maybe obtained by Kentucky hunters
upon payment of $1 each at the Coun-
ty Clerk's Office. Game is rnnrf
quite ptatiul hike mtioa.
BOOSTER IP
CALLED OFF
Owing To The Unsettled Con
dition of the Weather
Yesterday.
NO MORE THIS SEASON
Good Results Still Being Felt
From The Other Trips
Taken.
A final conference yesterday after
noon resulted in the permanent
abandonment of the Booster trip to
Princeton and other towns set for to
day, and there will be no more of
these trips this season.
The cold weather made it inadvisa
ble to attempt the trip planned and
as there is no likelihood of any suita
ble weather this fall for a period long;
enough to be advertised in advance,
it was decided to go into winter
quarters.
There is no doubt that much good
was done by the three trips takenajld.
good results are still being felt.
