Rev. J. F. Warner entertained
visitors yesterday.
Kirk Williamson and Frank
Sellers and their wives of the
Beech visited Mrs. M. E. Hahn
in this-place yesterday and at
tended divine services at the M
E. church.
Frank Luzena, wife and son
Harry, visited their daughter
Mary, living nar Troy, yester
day af teiTiOon.
Our M. E. Sunday school had
an attendance yesterday of 102
and a generous collection.
C. J. Miller and wife enter
tained visitors yesterday.
. J. H. Kniesly and wife had
visitors yesterday from the vic
inity of Oakland church.
B. Z. Gibboney and wife par
took of the hospitality of I. M.
Petersime's home yesterday.
The first number of our lecture
course, consisting of a musicale,
by three young ladies, was well
attended and enjoyed by all.
This augurs well and hopes are
entertained that the venture will
be a success.
P. B. Moul, H. M. and C. L.
Dershem, Lewis Krisman and
wife, I. M. Petersime, B. Z. Gib
boney, Mesdames M. A. Pickett,
B. F. Hahn, and P. B. Miller and
wife attended the Sunday School
Conference held in the Christian
church in Greenville " yesterday
afternoon. It seemed to be well
attended and was about as large
as the attendance at out S. S.
County Convention usually is.
This augurs well and bespeaks a
growing sentiment in favor of
the cause.
No matter, it seems, how much
persons may be admonished by
the occurrence of tragic events,
a course will be pursued by which
some person will suffer on ac
count of such happenings. While
out gunning for game this morn
ing, Chester, son of Samuel Hous
ton, living about 2 miles west .of
. Painter Creek, accidentally shot
and killed himself, the load en
tering his face and going upward
through the brain. He was aged
about 17 years.
North of this village about 2
miles a man by the name of Sul
zberger shot himself yesterday
with suicidal intent, but failed to
accomplish his purpose.
Rev. J. 0. Hillery, pastor of
our M. E. church, gave us his
last service yesterday before
changing to go to Toledo to fill a
vacant church of that city. It
was really a great surprise and
disappointment to our people to
lose his services so soon after his
re-appointment to this charge.
But the thing which most sur
prises his parishoners is that in
the change they can find no pro
motion.
Well, the nation as well as the
parts bas spoken, and the results
seem something like this : We
have met the enemy and we are
theirs. It was really a great
surprise in many of the accounts,
and seems difficult to determine
why it is thus. The most ra
that eome people are seized per
iodically with a paroxysm of
mental obliquity and this elec
tion dove tailed into that period,
and thus a sufficient number of
votes resulted to carry the elec
tion in some parts, making a
mixed result and placing some
doubt upon the national result,
whish it is claimed the official
count alone can clear up.

Wbere Intimidation
Really Exists.
Washington, Nov. 15. (Special
Correspondence.) Late in there
I cent political campaign informa
tion was given out from the De
partment of Justice to the effect
that large numbers of colored
men had been transported from
the South into some of the nor
thern states and that there was
suspicion that this was done un
der the guidance of Republican
campaign managers who wanted
to colonize these colored voters
for illegal purposes at the elec
tion.
Any man who would stop to
think would immediately see the
absurdity of such a proceeding
The transportation cost alone
would amount to not less than
$20 per voter, and it would cost
double that sum to keep the im ported
men in the voting pre
cincts until election t;me. While
there has undoubtedly been pur
chase of votes in both political
parties in the past, no political
campaign manager has ever paid
a price such as this in order to
add to the number of ballots in
the box on election day.
Notwithstanding the absurdity
of the story, the Depart. aent was
willing to let the impression go
out that Republican campaign
managers were directing the col
onization of men from the South.
The fact of the matter is, as
shown by census reports for a
number of years back, there has
been a steady drift of colored la
borers from the South to the
North because of the higher wa
ges offered and a greater demand
tor help. Moreover, the Depart
ment of Labor itrelt has been en
couraging this drift of colored la
borers northward, as its records
show.
The action of the Department
of Justice in thus endeavoring to
cast reflections upon Republican
campaign managers was no more
reprehensible than the ucusual
action of the Department of La
bor just before election in issuing
orders to its agents in the South
that they should discontinue aid
ing southern colored laborers to
find employment in the North
Here was a plain effort of the De
partment of Labor to utilize the
offices of the government for po
litical advantage.
One of the duties of the De
partment of Labor is to aid in
sending laboring men where their
services are most needed. If, in
the regular and legitimate exer
cise of that function, one party
gains or loses an advantage, that
is not the concern of the Depart
ment. It had been encouraging
colored laborers to move north
ward before thecampaign began
and it should have continued its
efforts along the same line with
out any variation whatever while
the campaign was in progress,
Any deviation in that regard
was nothing mere nor less than
an effort to use the powers of the
' government for partisan politica
advantage. ,

Get the Habit.
No matter what his vocation or
condition in life may be, every
man owes it to himself and to thf
world to form the habit of being
just as happy as he can. Hap
piness means harmony, and har
mony means health and efficier.-
Much natural ability is render
ed inefficient because men do not
lealize that discord, whether in
fear, worry, selfishness, hatred
or jealousy, is a health and hap
piness killer ; an efficiency blight
er. Many men waste more yi-
tality and mental energy in a few
minutes of hot temper than would
be required in the legitimate run
ning of their business for days.
Happiness is a great stimula
tor of growth. Nothing grows
when discordant. When we shall
have learned how to conserve our
energies by getting our minds
into harmony, even the hardest
dav's work will not tire us. It
is nerve exhaustion, wasted en
ergy through unnatural, discord
ant conditions, that makes us
jaded and tired out the result
of friction in our machinery. If
we could keep ourselves in a hap
py condition all day, we should
be fresh at night. It is by keep
ing ourselves in perfect harmony
that we become more efficient
and get the most out of life. Ex.

Silage for Dairy Cows.
Cows fed a ration compose i
largely of silage produced 17 per
cent more milk and 28 per cent
more butterfat than those given
a ration consisting mainly of grain
in a feeding test conducted for
121 days at the Ohio Experiment
Station. The silage ration was
also cheaper for milk production.
The coffs gained nearly 8 per
cent in milk yield when pat on
the silage ration. They produced
butterfat at a cost of 13 cents a
pound, while the cost of a pound
from the cows fed mainly grain
was 22 cents. There was little
difference in the gains in live
weight between the two lots.
In addition to 58 pounds of si
lage and 6.8 pounds of hay, the
one lot received only 4 pounds of
rrain consisting of oilmeal and
bran. The grain-fed lot received
only 12 pounds of corn stovtr and
hay but 13.5 pounds of a grain
mixture of oilmeal, cornmeal and
bran. .
