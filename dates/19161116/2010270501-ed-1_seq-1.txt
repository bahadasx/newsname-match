It has been years and years since
Democratic Jollifications of the good
old-fashioned kind have been held In
the north nnd west, but this year the
Bual proceedure was broken, and
rousing, rip roaring, red fire, Jubilee
parade demonstrations were held all
over the great west, the north and
the south.
Alliance was not hehnld anyone In
t-taging a celebration, either. Sat
urday night great Jubilee fires were
burned at the corners of Cox Dutte
avenue and Third street, and Box
IVutte and Fourth. Boxes, barrels,
and other articles were piled up In
advance and, it is rurnOred, certain
republicans contributed to the fire,
whether they would or not. The
Jollification was more than a celebra
tion over the victory of President
Wilson, It was a celebration because
the democratic party was victorious
both In the state and county.
lied signal lights were placed at
short intervals from the depot to
Fourth street on Box Butte avenue.
The marchers formed at the city hall
and with the Alliance band in the
lead they marched back and forth
between the two big Area, carrying
big cartoon banners full of humor to
those who understood the fine points
of the election full or humor at
least to the Victors. Bells, tin horns,
whistles, rattles and other noise
making Implements were brought In
to play and taken all In all It sound
ed as though the Germans were com
ing. Following tho great Jibilee parade
the marchers and the many on the
side lines, Including some republic
ans, repaired to the opera house for
the balance of the Jolliflcr.tion. The
scene at the opera house was of a
considerably different nature than
the one staged thero Tuesday night,

Prominent democrats of Box Butte
