Prohibition Progress
While Amendment No 8 wasdefeat
ed November 7 the Drys of the stale
get much encouragement from the elec
tion results Among other things
Jackson County and Kansas City
gave the amendment a substantial ma
jority
Kansas City is the largest town in
the nation to record a majority aganist
the saloon but thats like Kansas City
if shes any thing shes a leader
Jasper County gaen dry majority of
100
Joplins wet majority only 478
Greene County Including Spring
field voted dry
Randolph County in which is Mo
berly voted dry
Pettis County including Sedalia
voted dry
St Louis is no doubt reading the
handwriting on the wall but she only
allowed about 115000 dry votes to be
counted and recorded 140000 wet votes
Anybody who knows anything about
St Louis knows there are for more dry
votes there than these figures show
Dry workers the state over are plan
ning to continue the fighting and are
resolved that there shall be no let up
until the saloon is driven out of the
state and then out of the nation

The Jasper Commercial Club is to be
congratulated upon the work it is

gressive organization of course they
realize the money spent on road im
provements is money well and safely
invested but they made the discov

others When all the people come to
realize the truth about good roads it
will be an easy matter to get money
