Finaricic-r of tHc
KEVoi-UTlON
An immigrant boy,
he ran errands for a
Philadelphia store
worked, studied, saved
a little out of meager earnings against later needs. And
during the Revolutionary war Morris gave generously
of his resources for the blessed cause. His savings
helped make the Nation.
It is unlikely you will be called on to supply
funds to conduct a war for Independence. It is quite
likely, though, that you will need savings to tide you
over a family sick spell or save you from misfortune.
Have you set aside anything for the rainy day?
Start an account at this bank with a part of
your next salary. Add to the nest egg every pay day.
Watch the fund grow in a safe place and be able to
face the future courageously and independently.
Multiply your money in our care.

Report of the death of Miles Simmons
came as a shock to this community,
many not knowing that he was ill, so
short a time had it been since his at
tack of heart trouble on Saturday last.
Death came to him peacefully at 12.-00
o'clock, Wednesday night, November
15tbuat his home on South Main street.
Funeral services will be held at the
house on Saturday afternoon at one
o'clock. Kev. Waldren Geach will
preach the sermon and interment will
be made in Elmwood cemetery.
Mr. Simmons was.bom in Belleville,
Ont., in August 1831). When a young
boy he came with his parents to Michi
gan, settling in Worth township, Sani
lac county, at that time a wilderness.
When 22 years of age he enlisted with
the 10th Michigan Volunteers, and ser
ved throughout the Civil War.
In 1800, returning to Michigan, he
married Mary A. Losie, June 30th of
that year. For 33 years the home was
made on the farm in Sanilac county,
where three children were born, David
E.t of Munising, Mrs. J. T. Daumgard
ner, of Manistee, and Warren 13., of
Detroit, the latter being at his bedside
when he died.
Mr. and Mrs. Simmons retired from
farm life and made their home in Yale
where the wife and mother died Dec.
12th, 1800.
In July lOos Mr. Simmons married
Mrs. Mary Hennessy, who with the
daughter and sons survive him, also
two brothers, William T. of Amadore,
and Samuel of Yale, and one sister,
Mrs. E. Woodruff of Speaker.
The subject of this sketch was a man
of quiet personality, a consistent, earn
est member and worker of the Metho
dist Episcopal church, a -man most
highly respected and honored wherever
he was known.
He held the ollice of Adjutant of
Wm. 11. Dunphy l'o&t and Commander
of Lexington L'oil (J. A. It.
A Complete Surprise
"
On Wednesday evening at G .o'clock
while peacefully engaged in preparing
bupper, Kev. Waldren Ueach and family
were completely surprised in a most
unusual manuer by a host ot the mem
bers and attendants of the M. E.
church.
Mrs. N. J. Drouyor was tactfully sent
ahead to visit with the pastor's family
while tlfty or more of the friends were
gathering at the home of Dr. Wight
In a short time they all arrived bring
ing with them an elaborate pot-luck
bupper which all had the pleasure to
partake of.
After an hour spent in social chat
three of the men excused themselves
and wished all remaining friends good
night. In less than ten minutes they re
turned bringing on their shoulders a
beautiful Wilton rug, Dxl2. The retail,
cost of the rug was 855. When the rug
was laid down the Geaches were dumb
founded to even dream that their ser
vices were so generally appreciated.
Prof Drouyor made a timely, presen
tation tpeech and fully expressive
of the good will of the people. Kev.
Geach responded in his usual style in
behalf of the family telling of the deep
gratitude for the kind consideration of
their many friends.
The occasion will long be remember
nlon account of it being the birthday
of Mrs. Jotham Vincent who was the
instigatorof and solicitor for the hand

I am again in the realm of rummer
land. Every t ody and everything about
the same as when I left last spring with
the exception that several new arrivals
are whittling out homes in our immed
iate vicinity.
The former Yaleites are healthy,
happy and doing well. 1 found my
grove doing One and will have euough
grape fruit for my own use. My trees
vill not be three years old until Jan
uary. The most ideal weather prevails. I
have put in lettuce, beets and onions
and will get in some more stuff soon.
The small game, quail and rabbits, is
quite plentiful, but the quail season
doesn't open until the 20th. Kabbit
season never closes. The fish are bit
ing freely, so 1 am told, but have been
too imiy farming to go fishing yet.
I will tell you a fish story next time.

Saturday, Nov. 25th, Yale Mer
chants Plan Big Bargains For
Their Visitors.
In times like these it behooves the
people to lake advantage of any bar
gain that is offered by the merchants of
the town in which they do their trading.
Saturday next week, Nov. 25th, the
merchants of Yale plan to split their
profits with their customers, and have
concluded to put on a day of bargains
which they have styled the "Dollar
Day."
Each one of them are offering some
very attractive bargains, and in times
we are having now, when the bottom
is entirely knocked out of the markets,
and everything soaring in price it is
the wise man that lays in a supply
enough to last him for months to
come.
Each one of our merchants will
stretch a few points to make this bar
gain day one that will long be remem
bered by the consumers, and if the day
is a success it will probably be made
an annual event.
Head every one of the special offers
in this issue and make a list of what
you can use so your trading can be at
tended to without delay, as this will in
all probability be one of the biggest,
busiest days Yale merchants have ever
experienced.
Below we give a list of the enter
prising merchants who take part in
(his big "dollar saving event."
Emerson Cooper, who runs the Cash
Store in Masonic block, will do his
share to make your dollar do more than
one hundred cents' worth of business
on above date.
C. S. Cochrane is another one of our
general merchants who goes out with
a knife after old "High Trice." He
offers some bargains that are genuine
and will save you money.
E. Koy Fuller, jeweler and optician,
offers some very attractive prices on
goods in his line, and It will pay you
to feet in on some of his reduced prices
and save money on Xmas gifts.
George Gough, the veteran furniture
dealer will make a straight ten per
cent reductiou on any article purchas
ed at his store on "Dollar Day." This
gives you a line chance to make some of
your hard earned dollars go farther.
Grant llolden, of the "Kexall" store,
is always a good sport when it comes
to giving his customers a Ufty-tlfty split
on the profits, lie is offering mauy
prices on goods in his line that are real
money savers. Look over his ad.
There are very few things in a shoe
6tore that can come under the "Dollar
Day" head, yet Edighoffer Bros., of the
Yale Shoe Store, are in the deal head
over heels, and will do their share to
wards making your burden lighter for
the coming winter by good substantial
price reductions.
J. 1. Rosenthal, the leading clothier
of this section, and who combines low
price with high quality, is "Johnny-on-the
spot" with bargains that can't be
beat. For real money savers "Dollar
Day" see Ike.
Harry A. Williams, another one of
Yale's live business men, will be found
on the right side of this "Dollar Day"
proposition. He gives you a good
chance for early Christmas shopping
and will throw in something besides.
Call at the Yale Bazaar.
The Live Wire Stare of II. II. Beck
ett is offering some exceptional values
in clothing. You don't want to forget
them when trying to save money on
Dollar Day.
While they have nothing to sell, the
j ale Mate Bank has come out with a
big ad in this paper, asking that you
tart au account with them, using as a
begiuninir the money you save on
Dollar Day.
On Dollar Day, the Expositor will
give 82.45 worth of newspapers and
magazines for S1.0O. Take advantage
of this liberal offer.

Brown City Defeated
Yale High put one over on the pre-
sumptlous eleven from Brown City last
Friday by holding the latter squad to a
scoreless defeat, 3 to 0.
The victory for the locals is not
noteworthy merely as the first triumph
of the season, nor because they rendered
a shut out, but rather because of the
apparent comeback of the Yale aggre
gation. Brown City took great occasion to
gloat over the locals on account of the
walloping handed them early in the
season when the Yale line was green,
but Yale proved a good loser. A
month rolled by and again the schedule
offered combat between Yale and
Brown City. Fans offered odds on the
visitors.
Accompanied by hosts of supporters
seeped in ego and self satisfaction
the Browns Vnigrated as a body on a
special day, and, according to our gate
keeper outnumbered the local rooters.
The game was called at 3:30 and 30
minutes of struggle for supremacy
proved in vain. At the opening of the
third quarter, Yale led off with strong
offensive and with the ball on a twenty
yard line, oblique from goal, Van Nor
man booted a drop kick over the bar.
the only scoring feature of the game.
Three quarters of the game were play
ed almost entirely on Brown City terri
tory and only once was any real gain
against Y'ale.
Honey opened hostilities in the sec
ond quarter by intercepting a long pass
carrying the pigskin to within 16 yards
of the invulnerable goal before he was
downed by Captain Lndington.
Beyond the skirmish line no Brown
City man could advance although the
onslaught was formidable.
Lawson, on plunges, end runs and
bucks, was almost unimpeded and car
ried the ball for most of Yale's frequent
gains. Hitter starred on defense ap
pearing in every scrimmage, Luding
ton is to be lauded on his effective ma
nouvers and tactlce.
Vassar clashes the locals In the final
game of the high school schedule, on
Friday, Not. 17. City park is able to
accommodate a larger attendance than
usual.
The Princess Theatre will run after
noon and evening on Thanksgiving
Day, showing the World's Series base
