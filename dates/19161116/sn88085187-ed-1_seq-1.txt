NEW FACTORIES FOR TACOMA
HELD FOR
CATCH OF
16 TROUT
E. Festyn liar la. Tacoma tenor,
was hailed by the sporting editor
of a Tacoma evening newspaper
recently aa "tlie champion trout
fisherman of Pierce county."
The champ fisherman was
crowned with a photograph ol
himself on the sport page of the
Sunday edition, and held up as
a living model for all hunters of
tbe wily trout.
"A basket of 37 trout taken
frau the waters of rhumb, rs
creek Wednesday," said the ad
miring editor, "brought his total
for tlie season up to l.i so, and
every one of tlie fish were caught
with flies used."
Tlie iii.ii'tl Tacoma tenor
awl champ aiiKler was ung
ling in * 'limnln-1 s creek, hid
favorite haunt, yesterday,
when Deputy Game Warden
J. V. Heed happened upon
the scene and saw, lie says,
some small glittering object*
disappear into the noted ten
or's vest pocket**.
The game warden asked the
champ angler to let him see hit
catch.
Mr. Davis showed him the troJt
in his basket, but Mr. Reed was
curious about the vest.
A search of the pockets, says
the warden, revealed 16 tiny un
dersized trout, some of them not
more than three inches long.
Then the noted tenor waa ar
rested. The undersized trout
were in the aafe-keeplng of War
den Light Thursday.
But the alleged catching of the
small fish is not the only charge
against the noted tenor. The
warden declares he was standing
right on top of the dam nnd cast
ing his bait, contrary to law.
But to go back to the sporting
editor's interview with the champ
fisherman of Pierce county:
"Davis carries a little book
around with him on his fish
ing trips and puts down tho
number of fish caught in the
stream and the date of every
trip. Davis' figures show
that about 400 of his trout
were caught In Chambers
creek."
Then he quotes the noted tenor
in the following language:
"Chambers creek Is about the
finest rout stream around here.
"The fish are there ln millions.
"I have followed up parties who
couldn't get a strike and have
come away with a basketful."
Then the sport ed adds:
"Mr. Davis has' the highest
praise for Washington as a sports
man's paradise."

Tlie capltal-aud-labor situation
arising from the railroads' •e

son eight-hour law waa accentuat
ed by formation of a vast organi
zation of employers to be known
as the National Industrial Confer

poses, its organizers Met forth,
that industrial legislation shall be
watched more closely, that legis
ltiiors shall be guided 'iy public
information and that favoritism to
labor shall bo eliminated.
It will light such measures as
the Adamson law; and it believes
that the election showed ther Is
no "labor vote" and hence legis
lators hereafter need not curry fa

it claims has been done ln the
past.
Tho significance of the new
alignment increased with receipt
of word in United Press Baltimore
dispatches that the brotherhoods
will join to force the eight-hour
day in all industries—not by leg

ganized labor.
The railroads kept up their
preparations for trying to prevent
oieration of the Adamson law.
More suits, oovering all lines and
all districts, will be submitted to
courts all over the nation in the
next ten days.
It is apparent In railroad cir

Without putting on sale a sin
gle loaf of bread at the city bak
ery counter, Mayor Fawcett de
clared Thursday that he had al
ready won an Immense victory
over the makers' trust ln Tacoma.
A canvass of downtown stores
and bakeries by representatives of
the mayor showed that many re
tailers are not only refusing to
handle the "trust" bread, but are
undercutting the trust prices with
Independent bread, he says. Sev
eral stores are selling five-cent
loaves at 4 cents, and 10-cent
loaves at 8 cents, It was found.
Fawcett's desk was piled high
Thursday with letters and Times
coupons from Tacoma housewives
enthusiastically commending his
boycott of trust bread. The may

"The trouble now is that Taco
ma women don't know which

in newspaper advertisements. I
guess that will let the people
know plainly enough. If the
women will absolutely refuse to
buy bread of these bakers, It will
force the big fellows to come
down ln price quick enough."
Fawcett still maintains that he
will sell municipal bread If he has
to do It to force down the trust
prices.
Fawcett exhibited a lettei
Thursday from the Meadowmoor
dairy, on Broadway, which offered
to handle the municipal bread,
furnish free wrapping paper, and j
deliver it free, in order to help,
