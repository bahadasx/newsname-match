ROAD BOND ISSUE
IS HELD INVALID.
April 1st Union county voted
$450,000 in road bonds. The peo
ple of that county then, like
Powell, were wild with enthus
iasm for roads, and were anx-
"ious to pay the tax to set them.1
Union county taxpayers, like
Powell, as matters progressed,
snw (hat all in sight, for, them
was the. tax pari of it, ' ?o three
month's after the election some
sturdy farmers and enthusiastic
roads p'eople. o.f ,the, couuty gpt
together employed an attorney,
utid took the, matter to thecourts
with the result that the. .election
was knocked, kites high this
week.
The Union connty case is a
parallel case with Powell. Puu
ell's election was held teu days
later than in Union county, and
the same grounds for contest
exist.
The Times is strong for roads
but when we see an amount
greater than 24 of the bond'is
buo gone, and only 17 miles of
road surveyed and a surveyor
still permanently on the job at
$1,500 per year, we know that
our long fond hopes for better
roads through our Fiscal Court is
ta negitive proposition. The on-
tmethod of getting roads in this
ktion of the couuty is' to go in-

build them. The Times,, will
take the lead in subscriptions,
lei tig willing, under plans al
"ready agreed upon by the De
partment of Public Roads, to
give $000 for the various roads
leading from the west portion of
the couuty to Stautnn, the coun
ty seat. But the' first thing to
bo done is to get rid of the ob
noxious uud hindering bond vote

subscribe money to au effective

Gome in and let's talk this
matter over.
Powell County Bonds and Tax
to be Tested In Court.
We havo no doubt whatever
but that the proposed Powell
county road bond sale can be eas
ily annulled because of some il
legalities that the records will
show, and now that it vis con
clusive to the minda of all good
roads people who worked for. the
bonds in the beginning, that un
der the presont-procedure of the
powers that be, the $10,000 is not
going to get what they had v
right to expect, 'the cry on every
lip is "knock out the bonds aira
do away with the tax." Follow,
ing this admonition, a suit has
been drawn with that end in
view, and the same will be filed
and the legality of the Bale which
is advertised for the 22nd, tested
out.
