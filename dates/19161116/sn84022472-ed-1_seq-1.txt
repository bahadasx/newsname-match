t est In the sessions 'of the Mexican

Mexican commission. During his ab
sence at Philadelphia, Ignaclo Bonil

Mexican representatives, virtually
. agreed with the American commission
on the essential points of a plan of
border control. They expressed con
fidence of the support of Mr. Cabrera
, notwithstanding the opposition offer
' ed by him on Tuesday, the last time
he appeared at the conference.
Their optimism, however, was not
.shared by all those in touch with the
conferees early today. By a few of
them it was regarded as not improba-

the way of agreement again although
' all preperations have been madev for

In reply to the Hydraulic Co.'s at

voir as constructed is capable of . ab
sorbing, all the . water that can possi

would in the' belief of consulting en

the future of the company and
for Bridgeport." " . "
The steel mills .were founded in
Octpber, 1884, by Samuel R. Wilmot
and Willis F. Hobbs. Mr. Wilmot had
previously founded the Bridgeport
Brass Company in 1865, with D. W.
Kissam. 1
Under the name of Wilmot & Hobbs
the business was begun with a capi
tal of $125,000. It occupied a three
story building, 125x200, feet on Han
cock a venue. Samuel R. Wilmot was
president and Willis F. Hobbs, secre
tary. ;Charles M. Duprey was first
treasurer of the organized company
which then only, manufactured cold
rolled iron, carriage hardware, hoops,
steel bells, gongs, and other small pro
ducts. , The business rapidly expanded and
a second "mill was opened on Wordin
avenue at the foot of Howard avenue,
which is now utilized for hot and cold
rolling. ' Under a .reorganization,
June 20, 1899, the concern took the
name of American Tube & Stamping
Co.. which it still bears, with a capi
tal stock of $2,800,000. Another big
plant with furnaces and massive roll
ing machinery , was erected in that
section of East Bridgeport bounded
by Stratford and Seaview avenue and

received from' some farmers thatthey
propose1- to f-abandon, .dairying, rather
than make the needed, repairs to prop

Bridgeport milk dealers ' say that
the ,upward tendency of. prices for
grade and ordinary "cows which now
range from $100 to $150 an animal,
refutes the , claims of dairymen that
there is no money in the business.
Cows are said to have sold a, year or
so ago for prices as low' as $50. The
local dealers . in milk also , assert that
the price paid the producer has in
creased to a figure that will offset the
upward prices1 of grain and fodder
and still give a good margin of profit.
JE. W. Dewhirst, proprietor of the
Dewhlrst Dairy, predicts the elimina
tion, of the intermediate distributor
throughout the countryside -and that
the, big farmer and dealer will be
come ; bigger, the small man, still
smaller, with the supply of milk re
maining normal. " ,
It seems probable from statements
recently made by water company offi
cials that the increasing population in
Fairfield county will demand enlarge
ments of the Hydraulic Co.'s reservoir
system. With likelihood of increased
storage basins In the Aspetuck valley
denied by official statements it seems
certain from the topography of the
watersheds, of this county that the
old scheme of Increasing storage sup
plies in the Saugatuck . valley with a
tunnel through "Flirt Hill" will be
prosecuted with vigor and that the
reservoirs in Huntington will be in
creased. ,

" Reports.
Berlin, via' wireless to The Associ
ated Press, Nov. 16. Assertions that
the Germafc submarine which sank the
British ship Rowanmore, on which
there were several Americans, - fired
upon the lifeboats containing mem
bers of the crew are (dismissed as ut
terly false in the report of the com
mander of the ' submarine, further de
tails of which became known today.
On the contrary, it is said the men
on the Rowanmore owe their lives to
precautions taken ' by the . Germans
and the skill with which their opera
tions were carried out. During the 20
minute pursuit of the steamship, the
submarine's shots were aimed accu
rately astern to limit the danger to
the crew, which was congregated at
the bow. The Rowanmore has hit ten
ftimes, the last shell disabling her pro
peller.
The submarine,: ceased firing, the
report continues, immediately it was
apparent that the Rowanmore had
abandoned efforts to escape. just
before she stopped, the Rowanmore
hoisted a signal : but It was impossi
ble to 'read it from the submarine,
at that time" about 2,000 yards away.
Later '44 was showni that the signal
was "I surrender."
The master, of the Rowanmore at
tempted to Justify his attempt to es
cape, the submarine commander de
clares, , by asserting that he sought
time to launch his boats, but this pre
.text was not accepted. Later the
Rowanmore's captain was made a
prisoner of war for attempting to es
cape and for summoning assistance by
wireless through which ; she brought
up. a British destroyer. Thereupon
the Rowanore was sunk by a torpe
do. '
There were two white .Americans
and five Filipinos in the crew of the
Rowanmore, all of whom were sav
ed. - ' -

DELANEY ON HIS
JOB IN FAILURE
OF BURR&KHAPP
Prompt Action Taken on
Only Complaints That
Reached His Office.
That only two complaints ever
reached his office of fraud, in connec
tion with the Burr & Knapp failure,
was the statement of Alexander L.
DeLaney, prosecuting attorney of this
city, today, in connection with the re
cent sentencing of Herbert M. Knapp.
Mr. DeLaney showed plainly that
his office at all times had been ready
to act upon information of infractions
of the law in connection with the bank
crash. ,
The two complaints that reached Mr.
DeLaney's office were present by
co'unsel for the depositors, one of them
Attorney Ralph S. Beers, the other
Carl Foster.
"There was a question whether these
particular cases came within the scope
of the criminal law," said Mr. De
Laney. "Therefore I arranged a meeting-.'
with Galen & ' Carter, assistant
state's attorney, in the county court
house. He talked the two complaints
over with the lawyers and me, and
said that these cases were net for the
criminal authorities. The losers had
recourse only to the civil courts."
Spotswood D. Bowers, who was des
ignated a special assistant state's at
torney in the Burr & Knapp case, and
who prepared the evidence upon which
Knapp would have "been tried had he
not pleaded guilty, came into the case
! first in a civil capacity, as counsel for
losers through the failure of the bank,
Mr. Cummings thereupon entrusted to
him the task of investigating, and the
matter, in this way, did not go through
the hanids of the local prosecuting at

PAUL W.MORRIS
IS DEAD AT 51
OF PNEUMONIA
Brdigepbrter Was Regard
ed as One of America's
Foremost Sculptors.
Paul Winter Morris, formerly a resi
dent of Bridgeport and one of Amer
ica's best known sculptors, died last
night at his home in Westway, New
York city. ' He was 51 years old. He
had been ill with pneumonia for more
than a week. Yesterday his condition
became so serious that relatives in
this city .were called to his bedside.
Despite expert medical attendance
death occurred last night.
Mr. Morrirf was born in Chicago on
November 14, 1865. He was the son
of Marshall E. Morris and Mary Eliz
abeth Winters. The family residence
is a stately old mansion at Noble and
East Washington,, avenues, facing
Washington park. When very young,
the sculptor came to Bridgeport with
his parents. He attended the Bridge
port public schools and later attended
Rochester University where' he was
graduated. In 1886 he took up the
study of architecture and after grad
uation began) the practice of this pro
fession at Tacoma, Washington.
Mr. Morris' bent was the designing
of works of art rather than buildings
and he soon left Tacoma i to stxidv
sculpture under the guidance of the
most famous of modern , American
sculptors, Augustus Saint Gaudens.
He then went abroad for a year to
study in Paris and other famous art
centers of 'Europe. He returned to
America after taking prizes at every
students', exhibit at which he had of
fered his work. , j i
On' his return to this, country, Mr.
Morris established a studio In New
York city. One-of his first commis
sions was the execution of ' a hef pic
statue of Dr. Stokes, the eminent
Methodist divine and one of the foun
ders of Asbury Park, N. J. The sta
tue is placed in that famous sum
mer retreat of the members of ; the
Methodist Episcopal church. ' Later
Mr. Morris . designed a bronze bas
relief for the Craig Memorial In the
Holy Trinity . Protestant Episcopal
church,, Fifth avenue, New York city.
The bas-relief occupies the entire
space back of the baptsmal font and
depicts .the baptism of Christ by St.
John in the River Jordan. There are
more than a score of figures . in the
bronze.
- Mr. Morris also designed the bronze
tablet' to the Soldiers and Sailors, of the
Civil war, at the burial lot in Moun
tain . Grove cemetery. The figure of
the Civil war soldier leaning on his
gun against the granite tablet was
posed by the late Oscar C 'Beers, an
actor, and himself a veteran of the
Civil war. Mr. Morris designed the
Lincoln Memorial statue which Dea
con Edward W. Marsh of this city pre
sented to his home town of New Mb
ford and which now stands at the head
of the New Mllford Green. . In , the
terms of the will of the late Mrs.
William Hunt Perry, he had been com-
missioned to design the $75,000 me
morial arch which she desired to bef
erected for her husband at the Park
avenue entrance of Seaside park.
Whether or not he had started this
commission is not known.
Besides this statuary, Mr. Morris
was also the creator of a number of
notable' works of art. He was con
sidered o'ne of America's rising sculp
tors and his death will be ' widely
mourned in art circles here ana
abroad. -
In 1903 Mr. Morris married Eliza
beth Craig of Ardmore, Pa., who sur
vives him. There are no children. He
is also survived by his father, Marshall
E. Morris, a brother, Louis E. Morris,
and two sisters, Mrs. Edgar W. Bas
sick and Mrs. William T. Hlncks,,all of
this city. The funeral arrangements
have not yet , been tmade but the body
will be brought to this city for burial
n the family plot in Mountain Grove
cemetery.

That the Parsons Foundry Go
lost $200,000 during the las
few months because of tho
molders' strike, was asserted
last night by G. E. Bilton, head
of the company, according to
strikers who reported the inci
dents of . the meetingT this
morning when another gather
ing of the molders was held.
Mr. Bilton addressed the meeting
last night, according -to the report of
strikers this morning to P. F. Duffy,
organizer of the American Federation
of Labor, and promised the men 25
cents a day more with a 10 per cent,
increase on their. weekly pay besides,
if they, would return. This would
give them a wage of $3.85, more than
the strikers had demanded as a min '
imum wage.
Pickets returning from the .shop
this morning reported, said Mr. Duf
fy, that none of the strikers return
ed. Mr. Bilton was called on the
telephone this afternoon and asked if
the strikers returned. He- said
Tes," but refused to say over the
telephone how many. '
Indignation ran high at the meet-'-ing
of the strikers this morning when
a statement,- purporting to -come from'
Mr.. Bilton, was repeated, to the eflfevt
tha the had promised the men a 10 ,
per cent, increase and they had prom
ised the men a 10 per cent. Increase '
and they had promised to return to
work. -
' After, the meeting. Mr. Duffy said:
"No action was taken last night by
the strikers. Mr. Bilton addressed
them and asked, 'How many want to
go back -to work?'. They all raised
their hands. 'They're not loafers. '
They are workingmen whose living'
depends on their working. He didn't
ask them how many men wanted 'to
