COUNTY CAST ITS
GREATEST TOUl
WIDE ZONE OF INDEPENDENCE
MARKED IN THE BALLOTING
IN WILLIAMS
Frufer Receives lime—e Vote—
WUmb Hu 872 Over Haghea—
Strom Wins by 207
According to unofficial figures up
wards of 3.240 voters cast ballots in
Williams county November 7th near
ly twice as many as voted at the
June primaries. That the vast ma
jority have lost the habit of voting
'er straight is evident from the most
«"«i survey of the returns. Presi
dent Wilson, democrat, was the fa
vorite, over Chas. E. Hughes, repub
lican, by a plurality of 872, while
Lynn Trader, republican, outvoted
McArthur, democrat. 1182—a spread
of 2,004 votes.
Secretary of State Hall seems to be
the prize vote collector. In contests
where more than two names. were_ on
the ballot for the same office Hall is
high man with 1938 Frazier comes
second with 1921 and Wilson third
with 1781.
Apparently more voters were in
terested in the question of county aid
for the county fair than any other
Issue. On this question 8,240 votes
were cast while the total on presiden
tial candidates was 3,221 ana on gov
ernor 3,087. This is a* peculiar cir
cumstance as it is well known that
many voters pay no attention to the
little ballots. If there is an error in
the unofficial figures it is of slight
importance as county aid for the fair
was voted down .decisively—1436 to
1804.
Strom Gets 207
The only county contest at all close
was sheriff. Axel Strom was the
winner by 207 over L. V. Coulter.
The closest fight for a state office
was between John Steen, republican,
and P. M. Casey, democratic non
partisan "SfrdofSee, for state treasurer.
Steen, who won out in the state by a
few hundred, was bested in this coun
ty by his opponent, 1284 to 1237.
Big Vote For Frank Fisk
Judge Frank E. Fisk received a
splendid endorsement at the polls in
both Williams and' McKenzie counties
and carried Mountrail, his opponent's
county, by a small majority. Fisk's
majority in Williams was 1215.
All amendments and referendums
carried, the bootlegging law receiv
ing the largest majority—1664 for
and 1052 against.

RAILROAD STRIKE
MAY YET RESULT
RAILROADS WILL START SUITS
TO ENJOIN 8-HOUR LAWS
OPERATION
Great Northern Road Begins Action
In U. S. Court In St Paul to
Get Injunction
Washington, Nov. 15.—Attorney
General Gregory haa decided that the
suits by the railroads against the en
forcement of the Adamson eight-hour
law will be defended by the depart
ment of justice. The defense to be
presented in each case is to bi work
ed out between Solicitor General
Davis and other department officials
with the United States attorneys in
the various jurisdictions.
Railroads Accept
New York, Nov. 15.—The New
York Ceneral railroad has filed in the
federal district court here the first in
junction suit to be brought by an
eastern road to test the constitution
ality of the Adamson law, it was an
nounced by Albert H. I. Harriss, gen
eral counsel for the New York Cen
tral today.
The action is directed against Uni
ted States States District Attorney
Snowden here, and several local offi
cers of the four trainmen's brother
hoods. A temporary stay will be
sought, which will enjoin the defen
dants from instituting prosecutions
against the road to compel it carry
out the law.
5,000 Suits Are Likely
Railway managers comprising the
national conference committee con
tinued today the consideration of
whether wholesale legal action to de
feat the Adamson eight-hour law will
be taken or whether a limited series
of injunctions will be filed. The con
census of opinion favored the former
course, which would result in approx
imately 5,000 actions^ covering the
entire 'railroad territory of the Uiii-'
ted States. Whichever method is se
lected, the cases are expected to be
in the courts within a few days.
The Railroads' Stand

day, there will be special meetings for the women in a separate
room. Practical problems of the farm household will be discussed.

WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY. NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1916. $1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
The attitude of the railways was
summarized in a statement issued by
Elisha Lee at the close of an all-day
meeting of the railroad representa
tives. The statement follows:
"We are all agreed to fight to the
end. The means to be employed were
fully discussed and the concensus of
dpinion was that it was necessary to
file suits questioning the constitution
ality of the law in every federal dis
trict court in which the affected rail
roads operate."
Leave it Up to Wilson
Warren S. S(pne, president of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers, summarized the brotherhood's
side of the case iust before boarding
a train for Cleveland.
Mr. Stone said:
"The situation is closed in so far as
We are Concerned. We are not at all
alarmed. We know what President
Wilson intended we should have. We
know the explanation he made to our
six hundred chairmen in the White
House. We feel confident that if the
present law does not give as the
eight-hour day. the president will
give us a law that will*
"We can't understand the attitude
of the railroad, managers. They did
hot file their first suits until the day
after election, believing that Mr.
Hughes had been elected. Personal
ly, I believe they are either whistling
to keep up their courage or they are
trying to scare the public into sympa
thizing with them."
Great Northern Files Suit
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 15—The Great
Northern railroad has asked the fed
eral district court here for an order
to prevent the enforcement of the
Adamson law. The suit is the first
filed by a road in this territory and is
similar to suits filed by the Louisville
and Nashville, the Athcison. Topeka
and Santa Fe and the Union Pacific.
Named as defendants are Alfred
Jacques of Duluth, United State's dis
trict attorney F. A. Mallen, local
chairman of the Order of Railway
Conductors A. K. Rowe, local chair
man of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers T. Olson, local chair
man of the Firemen and Enginemen,
and P. A. Porter, local chairman of
Trainmen.
The enforcement of the Adamson
law will result in great financial loss
to the railroad, according to the peti
tion.
Frank Hyland, the live stock auc
tioneer, was reelected to the state sen
ate from Ramsey county, over the
nonpartisan candidate.
Towner county voted against aid
for a county fair. Wells county voted
on the question but the result has not
appeared among thf returns.
Three counties indulged in county
seat fights. Amidon lost the seat of
government of Slope county, Mar
mar th being the winner. Medora won
in Billings county over Fryburg.
Manning retained county seat hon
ors in Dunn against Killdeer and
Dunn Center.
Wilson carried 32 counties in North
Dakota and Hughes 16.
The official figures in New Ham
shire giv'e the state to Wilson by 63
votes.
The official canvass in both Cali
fornia and Minnesota is being closely
watched. ^Wilson apparently has Cal
ifornia by about 3,400 and Hughes
leads in Minnesota by a few hundred.
Appreciation Week
Dates In January
President R. J. Hughes of W^hpe
ton, head of the State Press Associa
tion D. R. Carlson of Towner, Secre
tary and M. I. Forkner of Langdon
and E. L. Richter of Larimore, repre
senting the North Dakota Press As
sociation met with representatives of
the North T)akota Development Lea
gue Press Bureau at Grand Forks and
laid definite plans for North Dakota'
Appreciation Week. At this meeting
an Executive Committee was elected
and officials were instructed to pro
ceed with active plans for North Da
kota's big annual publicity movement.
It was decided, after general discus
sion, to follow suggestions coming
from different sections of the state,
and to set this year's "Big Week" at
a later date than was named last year.
The week of January 21 to 27 was
named as the next North Dakota Ap
preciation Week.
By holding it later, it is believed
that more effective work and publicity
will result as farmers in other sec
tions of the country who might be in
terested in our advertising matter
have more time in January and our
own people will also be able to give
more attention to the work in the be
ginning of the new year instead of in
November, which is our busiest sea
son in North Dakota.
Newspapers, Commercial Clubs.
Churches and schools in all parts of
the state will be asked to co-operate

Scattering Results
Of the Battle
A. T. Cole, editor of the Search
Light at Fargo was elected district
judge over Judge C. A. Pollock by
1780 votes.
South Dakota went for prohibition
and Hughes and against, woman auf
frage. First reports indicated suffrage
had carried.
Unofficial returns show John Steen
reelected state treasurer by between
200 and 300 votes. The totals with 14
precincts not reported were: Steen
49,874 Casey 49,646.
Montana is believed to have gone
for prohibition by a large majority
but the figures will not be known un
til the offifial state canvass is com
pleted. Sheridan county, the home of
Mondak, voted for prohibition, 3438
against prohibition, 1805.
The election brought the number of
dry states up to twenty-three. Mis
souri gave a big majority for prohibi
tion outside St. Louis but the St.
Louis wet vote more than wiped it out.
The county of Grant was created
out of a portion of Morton and there
is a lively scramble for appointments
as county officials and eight or ten
towns want to be temporary county
seat.
The creation of Grant gives North
Dakota 53 counties in its pack. Some
one wants to know wlpich is the joker.
Frazier received the largest vote
ever cast for a candidate in North
Dakota.
Cavalier and Bottineau counties
voted to retain their county agricul
tural agents. Each county employs
two agents.

It is plumb up to the top—the red
streak on the big white thermometer.
Whan the campaign closed at Mid
night Wednesday night, the $40,000
goal- tad been reached and passed. At
suppenime when the reports of the
day were made at Library hall the
figures stood at between $38,000 and
$39,000. The managers of the cam
paign agreed that it would never do
to let the hour set for closing the
campaign arrive without the full ob
ject achieved.
A parade headed by the band and
including many of the active worker*
riding in cars and marching in col
umns, and an emblematic hospital
float, marched through the principal
streets, while solicitors made a Anal
effort to raise the amount necessary.
Returning to the library, the team
captains and workers again reckoned
results and struck a total which
proved to be a little over $100 short
of the $40,000. This was immediate
ly made up by additinal subscriptions
from the workers themselves.
A few workers who are out on
branch lines failed to reach home in
time to report last night and it is
probable that their efforts have not
been fruitless. Also available for^he
hospital fund is about $400 that was
deposited in a local bank at the time
the first effort was made to raise a
fund for a hospital. A fraternity day
was held and the fraternal bodies and
the secret societies united in a tag
sale that made up the above sum.
The property of the Wittenberg
hospital association will also be con
verted to the purpose of erecting the
new building. This will amount to
several, thousand dollars, so that al
together the total funds that will be
available at the time the new hospital
is completed will approximate $f0,0t»0.
Feat Accomplished by Organization
The splendid result of the hospital
campaign is attributed by the cam
paign managers to organization and
co-operation. These were absolutely
necessary in addition to the magnifi
cent liberality of the people Wil
liston and the territory surrounding.
The workers say that too much can
not be said in praise of the generous
response that met their efforts. The
raising of such a sum in such a short
time in a community with the popu
lation of this, was possible only tnru
practically everyone's doing his part.
With a few exceptions the surround
ing country and towns helped the
fund liberally. In round numbers
$30,000 was raised in tha city of Wil
liston. The other $10,000 was sub
scribed by the nearby towns and
cduntry.
Great credit for the thorough or
ganization and faithful work of the
campaign is due to Reverend Johan
son, Mr. and Mrs. Currier, the team
captains and the army of individual
workers.
Orange and Black
Clans Gathered
The evening of November 11 will
long be remembered by the 1916 high
school football squad and its friends.
As guests of Mr.* and Mrs. Joe
Cutting, amid surroundings that
breathed football tradition and foot
ball inspiration, the defenders of the
Orange and Black enjoyed a feast of
things good for both the body and
the mind. The close of the local foot
ball season has frequently been mark
ed by a banquet given by the school
for the coach but this year the coach
got the jump on the boys and beat
them to it. It has been remarked that
it is hard to get ahead of one of those
old time Minnesota men.
The hostess, assisted by Mi^. L. O.
Yonker, had filled the pretty home
with appropriate decorations, using
orange and black as the color scheme.
A oair of goals adorned each table
and a real football (the kind the Wil
liston high boys play) rested in the
center of the field of action—and the
last word is selected advisedly. Minia
ture footballs we're found at each
plate and made neat souvenirs of the
occasion. When opened the tiny
"pigskins" revealed slips with foot
ball questions and conumdrums to be
ask of some other guest who came
back in kind, thus making an ex
change of punts that was interesting
and brain tickling.
After the delicious four-course tur
key dinner Toast Master Vettle gave
the signals that brought a number of
the guests to their feet to talk on any
topic they might choose.
After the repast the company spent
a most enjoyable season in athletic
discourse and in discussion of "Joe's"
fine collection of football books, pic
tures and clippings. Those so for
tunate as to be present were:
Harold Bruegger, Willis Farries,
Mack Nelson, Pat Harvey, Rusael
Levitt, Orville H. Bruegger, David
Greengard, Clifford Gordon, Hulbert
