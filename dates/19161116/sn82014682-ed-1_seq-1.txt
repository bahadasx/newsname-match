Kalakana Day is not being observed
as a general holiday but it is being ap
propriately observed none the less.
Some of the courts are closed and
some business houses did not open,
city offices wre closed at noon,
some employes are absent from their
desks. Appropriately it is a Hawaiian
day for Hawaiians and equally appro
priately some Hawaiian customs mark
its commemoration. Naturally inter
est centered much about those who
were of the royal family, about Queen
, Lilluokalani and the home of Princess
David Kawananakoa, where a recep
tion was the chief feature of the morn
ing program, and many called at the
home of the queen.
Pa-u riders paraded the streets in
gay attire to the home of the queen
and thence to the reception. The Ha
waiian band played Hawaiian airs
and there were miniature yacht races
in the harbor, yachting being a sport
the late king is said to have greatly j
enjoyed. The culmination win come
this evening at the ball in the armory
to which hundreds of guests have been
bidden. To hundreds it is a holiday
in all but name. Further, it shows
what may be done In later years now
that a start has been made.

horses 14 Kaohelelanl pa-u riders pa

The riders then followed Beretania

the home of Princess Kawananakoa is
situated. , There a reception was held
by the princess for Hawaiians only.
They then disbanded until this even
ing, when they wJtl attend the recep
tion and ball at the armory.
The costumes of the pa-u riders this
morning were very gay. The first
nine wore black and gold, then came
a rider dressed in purple and follow

All wore lets and the horses, too. were
decorated with ribbons and leis.

Dr. Li Trial Progresses Slowly
and End of Case. Seems
Far Away
For more than an hour this morn
ing Attorney J. W. Cathcart, one of
counsel for Dr. K. F. Li, argued in
federal court against the admission as
evidence the opinion of physicians as
to whether the alleged prescription
for a so-called cure for the opium
habit, claimed hy the prosecution to
have been administered by Li. if ad
ministered according to directions, be
recognized as a proper treatment.
This is the so-called "elixir" that
Mazie Crystal, alias Annie Halfer of
Iwilei testified she was given by U to
hrpak hpr of the ODitim habit. Mazie
testified she took the "elixir," but that
it "hurt her. "It was no good ana
Dr. Li knew it-was no good," she de
flared cn the stand. Judge H. W
Vaughan gave a rather lengthy verbal
decision following the argument ana
overruled Attorney Cathcart's objec
tion. ';
Harry iiothberg was recalled to the
stand today and produced a promis
sory note which, he testified, he had
paid cn the same day he asserted he
loaned Mazie Crystal $23 in Li's office
"to pay for some drug." Several ques
tions were asked rtothberg regarding
an alleged demand by Mazie of $20,
000 from Li after she had taken an
overdope of drug which confined her
to a local hospital for some little time.
Rothberg. in response to a question,
said that the alleged suit was i ever
brought.;
Is vonr re:il name Harrv uotn
! berg?" Cathcart inquired.
Rot hhers said it was. He addeu '
that he' 'Was born in Russia.
' And in Russia was your Christian '
name Harry ?"' inquired the attorney.
"I'm not a Christian," Rothberg
responded. Otlier witnesses called today were
Dr. V. C. Hobdy and the post adju
tant at Fort Shafter. Further trial of
the L case will be had at ft o'clock
tomorrow morning.
