Government's Defense
Fargo, N. D., iNov. 15.—Suit
will be filed in the federal dis­
trict court here this afternoon by
Judge N. C. Young on behalf of
the Northern Pacific railroad, for
the prevention of the enforce­
ment of the Adamson eight-hour
law. The suit is directed against
District Attorney Hildreth and
the leaders of the four brSther
hoods.
Suits will be filed by the Qreat
Northern and Milwaukee rail­
roads tomorrow. \.
Similar suits will be filed in all
federal district courts throughout
the territory through which these
roads run.
New York, Nov. 15.—Suits filed by
railroads against the'federal govern­
ment to test the constitutionality of
the Adamson eight-hour law also are
expected to result in the interpretation
of the statutes, if it is upheld, the rail
road managers, comprising the Na­
tional Conference Committee of Rail­
ways, announced ih a statemehthere
tonight.
SlHts designed to test the validity of
the law and to retrain the govern­
ment. from putting it into effect were
filed here today by the New York' Cen­
tral and Rrie railroads.
Explains Program.
Similar suits were to lie brought
within the next few day9 by each rail­
road in the conntry in each ot the fed­
eral districts it traverses according to
Eli.sha Lee, Chairman of the Confer­
ence Committee Mr. Lee issued a
statement at the end of the commit­
tee's three-day secret session, explain­
ing the railroads' program in their
fight against the law. The statement
follows:
"Two questions are involved in the
appeal by the railroads to the courts
for liught on the Adamson law:
"One—Is the law constitutional?
"Two—If it is cqnstitutional, what
does it mean?
"Opinions have been expressed by
eminent authorities that the law Is un­
constitutional, and thire are conflict
ins opinions as to how the

Suits 8tart in Many Places.
Washington, Nov. 15.—Suits by rail­
roads attacking the constitutionality of
the eight-hour railroad law were be­
gun today in many parts, of the coun­
try and the department of justice lay
plans to defend them.
•No offer has yet been made by the
railroads to settle the question by .one
test case. It was stated, officially that
Attorney General Gregory has' made
no such proposition to the railroads,
and the department is planning to con­
test each suit as it comes up for hear­
ing. Assistant Attorney General Un­
derwood will have direct charge of
the government's defense, and Frank
Haggerman of Kansas City, Mo., has
been retained to assist.him. Mr. Un­
derwood expects to appear personally
in most of the cases, but their number
may make it necessary for him to em
Iloy .other special counsel.
The attorney general and Solicitor
General Davis have been in confer­
ence with Mr. Underwood frequently
since the first suits were filed, and the
Kfneral lines of defense have been
laid. Information so far reaching the
department shows that the railroads
Jjase their prayers for temporary re­
straining orders against the law be
coming effective on the ground that it
is unconstitutional and incapable of
enforcement. Tbe government will re­
sist those contentions and asserts that
congress had ample power to enact
such legislation.

New Sheriff
Out An Auto
Vla Joy Ride
(Tribune Mandan Bureau)
Mandan, N. D., Nov. 15.—Oscar Ol­
son, newly elected sheriff of Morton
county, Is out one perfectly good auto­
mobile as a result of the disastrous
termination of a little joyride indulged
in this evening by Fred Stabler and
Archie Wilkinson of the postoffice
force.
The young men had borrowed the
machine-for an afternoon spin and
were returning when, at a point neat1
the George Welch farta, Stabler, driv­
ing, lost control of the car. The ma­
chine swerved, a front^wheel struck a
rut, and the car turned'over, throwing
Wilkinson 15 feet away and caroom
ing. Stabler into a convenient barb
wired fqnee. When the young men got
back to the machine it was in flames,
and in spite of everything they could
do, the car, a 1915 Reo, was completely
destroyed. The machine was insured.
Neither of the young men was serious­
ly ^hurt. ...

Regan, X. D., Nov. 15.T7-H.er first at­
tempt 'to drive an automob'iie proved
fatal to Mrs./ Albert Thompson, a
short distance from the home ot her
father, Joseph Miller, Sr., on Tuesday
evening, WheA the car which shjB wuh
steering turned over, crushing her be­
neath it and killing her instaritly.
iMrs. Thompson's companion, Edward
Nolan, residing IS miles northoiist of
Regan, was also pinned under the
car, and his escape from a similar
fate is a mystery. The 6-year-old
daughter of the deceased, who was
also in the front of the car when the
accident occurred, was thrown clear
of the wreck by Mr. Nolati. She fell
on the soft turf, unhurt.
Had iNever Driven Before.
•Mrs. Thompson, who had been em­
ployed as housekeeper for Edward
and James Nolan, never had driven a
car until Tuesday. She had set out
with Edward Nolan for a sale near
Wing, and later had driven to the
home of her brother, Joseph Miller,
Jr. Enroute she had steered the car
a short distahce, and, proud.of her
prowess, she had insisted on again
taking the steering wheel upon leav­
ing her brother's for the journey
homeward. The party had proceeded
only a mile and a-half, when, as the
car was speeding over the level praij
rie, Mrs. Thompson lost control. The
machine swung in a half circle, shot
into the air, turned completely over,
and fell on top of its occupants. No­
lan only had time to throw the child,
whom he was holding in his arms,
away from the machine before he
was pinned to the earth. ...
Extricates Himself.
By sheer strength, Nolan extricat­
ed himself from the 3,700-pound bur­
den which was slowly crushing him
to death, and, unable to free his com­
panion, he ran more than a mile to
the nearest house to procure aid. It
finally was found necessary to lift
the car with jacks before the body
of the dead woman could be extricat­
ed. Life had then been extinct for
some time and it is presumed that

St. Paul, Nov. lo"—With 46 of the 86
counties in Minnesota having turned
in their tabulation sheet to Secretary
of State Schmahl, and with unofficial
returns from the remainder, including
Hennepin and Ramsey, Mr. Hughes'
plurality tonight was down to 386. The
total vote was:
Wilson 177,798
Hughes 178,183
The sheet from Renville county
made the big difference over last,
night's lead of more than a thousand,
credited to the Republican candidate.
Hennepin and Ramsey returns are ex­
pected tomorrow, and Democrats are
basing their hopes on enough gain for
the president in those two' counties,
and the other 38 no haying reported,
possibly, to change the result^
The official vote checked over at the
capitol today gave Wilson 69,598 and
Hughes 80,075, indicating a big lead
for the Republican candidate outside
the Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minne­
apolis, notwithstanding the plurality of
1,222 Duluih and St. Louis counties
gave the president. In- the 46 coun
tiest Allan L, Bensdn, Socialist, polled
8,095 and J. Frank Hanley, Prohibi?

All are blondes, although Mrs.

If Mrs. Trumper is acquitted, she
will get the baby. If found guilty of

child, but may be sent to the peni­

London, November 15.—'While the British were further advanc-'
ins their front nqrth of the Ancre river, or consolidating their new­
ly won positions, the French and.dermans have been engaged in
violent combats both north and south- of the Somme. In both re­
gions the Oermans made gains,—in the northern corner and west­
ern outskirts of the St. Pierre—vast, wood north of the river, atldl
in the eastern part, of the village of Pressoire, south of theL stream.
The French official communication, in admitting the loss of the
ground, says the Germans obtained only limited advantages at the
price of very heavy losses. In the north, the German attacks ex­
tended from Les Boeufs to the south of Bouehavesnes, a front of
five miles, and sonth of the Somme from Ablaincourt, to the Chaul
nes wood, about three miles: The attacks were launched after vio­
lent artillery preparation.

Funds Will Be Immediately Placed
at Work Again— Splendid
Record
State bonds totaling $106,700 were
retired yesterday at a joint, meeting of
the atate board of university and
school lands and the state auditing
board. Governor L. B. Hanna is chair*
man of both boards. State Treasurer
John- Steen, Secretary of State Thom
afl Hall, State Auditor Carl Jorgenson
and Attorney General H. J. Llnde are
members of the state auditing hoard.
All of the above except State Treasur­
er Steen and with the addition of
State Superintendent of Public Instruc­
tion E. J. Taylor, are members of the
state board of university and school
lands.
Retired From Sinking ^und.
The bonds taken up yesterday were
retired from the sinking fund. They
included the complete issue of agri­
cultural college Etate bonds due in
1921, $50,000 the complete issue of
university and school mines state
bonds due in 1921. $50,000, and $6,700
of the university state refunding
bonds, due in 1!}19,
There remains a small amount in
the sinking fund after the payment of
these issues and effecting a saving to
the state of approximately $20,000 in
interest charges which would hare ac­
crued during the next five years.
Available for Farmers.
Of far more importance than the
saving itself, is the fact that $106,709
is immediately available for the pur­
chase of public school bonds and farm
mortgages which are now offered ,the
state. The agricultural development
of tbe state and the extension of its
public school system is advanced just
so much.
Splendid Record Ntotfe.
The bonded debt of North Dakota by
the action taken yesterday is reduced
to only $472,000. Four years ago the
'bonded indebtedness, of the state was
$937,300. Since 1912 there have been
taken up $465,300, and there is still a
small balance in the state bond sink­
ing- fund.
Efficient management as well as a
generally prosperous condition for the
state are reflected in these figures, and
the retiring administration is being
complimented upon its good steward­
ship.

There was no lack of amateur crlt«

Only a block has been completed to
