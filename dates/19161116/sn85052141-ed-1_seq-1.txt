you can make them stay at home if
you fit your living room with furniture
that is comfortable and that you don't
need to be afraid to hurt by sitting in
it. That's what good furniture is in
tended for, and that's the reason we
sell good furniture furniture which
fulfills its purpose. If you have that
kind your men folks will be glad to

BARRETT LEEDF6l23
BIG OLLIE JAMES SAYS
SECTIONALISM IS DEAD.
Senator Ollie M. James, of
Kentucky sees the burial of iee
tionalism in the re-election of
President Wilson. - .
"The victory of Woodrow Wil
son proclaimed the death of sec
tionalism as a political issxie . i"
this country," said Sen. James.
"Never again will the people of
America be stirred by the hates
and passions of 50 years ago, re
surrecter by political partisaits
for campaign effect. That old
stuff won't go any more in this
reunited country, as is shown con
clusively in the defeat of Mr.
Hughes. Never aeain will parti
sans like Senator Lodge and Mr.
Hughe be able to make section
alism a rallying cry in a presiden
tial campaign.
' Maine, where Mr. Hughes first
sprang sectionalism, resident
Wilson missed carrying by only
a tew thousand votes, and m
Senator Lodge's State the presi
dent made a most remarkable
showing. The victory of Presi
dent Wilson conveys a warning
to those who seek to stir up
the old strife and bitterness for
the sake of promoting the cause
of an aspirant to a political of
fice. .
"In the virile west, where there
is a wholesome respect for the
best standards of Americanism
ami an America, one and united,
the appeals to sentiments of sec
tionalism were utterly empty
and futile. Even in the east
there was but a feeble response
in only a few sections to the ap
peals of those who would re
vamp sectionalism for party prof
it. Thank heavens, the election
of Wood row Wilson Las forever
banished the ghost of sectional-
ism.
