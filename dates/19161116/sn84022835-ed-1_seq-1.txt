RED CLOUD
Feature Play Friday Night
The Hillman Stook company, playing
at thcOrpheum this week, will present
tho feature play of their tnjagrment
Friday night, a bensatioual problem
drama, 'Trilling with Tomorrow"'.
This Is the only play ovir written cm
thu subject of Eittliniiubln (peaceful
death). It is one of tho big success's
en Broadway this season. F. P. Hill
man has secured the4 western produc
ing rights and ho considers "Trilling
with Tomorrow to bo the strongest
play ever offered in Red Cloud by 11113
of thu Hill man companies,
Tho poaceful slumbers -of tho resi
dents of Bed Cloud wens disturbed
about 3:30 Friday morning by thu
jingle of the fire-boll. Upon report
lug at headquaiters of thu lire laddies
were informed that thu homo of Ancil
Crublll was on Ore. A record breaking
run was mado to that place, arriving
there they found that Mr. Crabill and
some of tho neighbors had tho flro
extinguished. Tho origin of tho lire
is somewhat of a mystery, as It started
ie'iiiul a refrigerator on the back
porch, tho suinB being practically con
sumed, A small hole was also burned
through the wall of thu houso.

Farmers' Institute
Is Now In Full Blast
The Webster County Farmers' Insti.
tuto is now in session and It is being
demonstrated that this is tho bost yut.
Nine years ago this association was
formed aud as tho years go by it has
been increasing in popularity until now
it is known as the best of its lilt id in
the state. All thu statu workers tell
the sumo story, that lied Cloud has tho
greatest Farmers' Institute in thu
state of Nebraska.
An array of willing workers has
made this year's sebsion n grand suc
cess. Everything is carefully a u d
comfortably arrangod so thatthu visit
ors have no diillciilty in viewing tho
exhibits.
Thu greatest Itnprovomont over other
years is to be found in thu ladles' de
partment and farm products depart
ment. Thu ladles have fail ly outdone
themselves in their ell'ort to show the
world what can be done for tho homo.
Here you will Hud on display tho very
finest dishes that thu ImugiiMtioti can.
I.. I....1 .... ...1 .!!..!
utinucnL'i i:uuiii:u iu ii nn;i'i mill mrs.
played to tlie very best advantage.
One exhibit showed how tho farmer
could have fresh meat all Milliliter by
a new process of canning. Then there
you will ''d bread like mother used
to make, pies, cookies, tarts, cakes
and a lot of other dishes that meie
man hesitates to name.
In this dupartuiaut is to be found
the school exhibits. A careful exitinm
ntion of tho work of thu school child
ren will reveal a marked iuiprovumcnr
over former years in writing aud draw
ing. Wo counted llfty-ono dlffcrtji
varieties of wood gathered by one of
tho boys around the home place. This
exhibition Is a credit to thu children,
their teachers and the superintendent
iu charge.
On tlie whole tho farm products de
pHrtmeut is far ahead of former years.
Thu selection of all kinds of farm pro
ducts shows either a butter yield or
olt-e a better knowledge of what to
suleot, perhaps it would bo fair to sav
of both. The corn exhibit is simply
oxcollont. You will find corn hero as
largo as any raised in Iowa 01- Illinois
and a quality that is excelled by none.
The Pumpkin contest resulted in
somu enormous vegetables that look
liko tho ordinary kind magnified a
dozen times. How any onu can got
these monsters to grow is indeed a
groat mystery to this editor but they
are there and 110 mistake.
Tho cattle aud sheep and hogs de
partment is better than ever 1beforo
aud these animals bring forth unstint
ed pralso. They are fine specimens
and Wobstor county feels proud of
them. Tho number of horses on ex
hibition is not so largu as some years
past but what this department lacks
is quantity it makes up iu quality.

tho past two nights:
