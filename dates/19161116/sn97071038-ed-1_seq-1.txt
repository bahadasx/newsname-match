Sale of Farm Property
J. A. Osborn, a wheat farmer near
Lexington, made a peculiar sale of his
farm the past week. Mr. Osborn
sold his ranch to Marsh White of Lex
ington, but reserved one acre and his
house for himself. The ranch consists
of one quarter section of land. Mr.
Osborn did not care to sell himself
out of house and home so he kept one
acre of good old Morrow county soil
upon which to live. The price Mr.
White paid for the land was in the
neighborhood of $4800. Thirty dol
lars an acre would indicate that land
values are rising in that section of
Morrow county.

the Club was against holding the
Chautauqua here next year. It ap
peared that the Ellison-White people
demanded an absolute guarantee of
some $1100 or $1200 for the sale of
tickets and the Club did. not feel in
clined to recommend if to the citizens
of Heppner under that condition.
A letter from the Portland Cham
