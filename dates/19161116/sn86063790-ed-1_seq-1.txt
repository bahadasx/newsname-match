N^ws Items Gathered All Around the
County and Elsewhere.
Ehrhardt Etchings.
- Ehrhardt, Nov. 14.?What ideal
weather prevailed last week! Fine
for "tater digging," "possum' hunting,"
and "fair going;" too warm for
"cane grinding." A lot of us went
down to the fair at Walterboro last
week, some spent the week with
friends, taking in the fair every day,
others only visited it for one day;
- all report a good time, especially
those who took the trip called "over
and under the sea," supposedly in a
submarine boat. The voyage was a
rough one and it was difficult in keepyour
hair off its end, but you came
out unhurt and with a broad grin.
Mr. J. W. Goodson, of route Xo. 1,
is having a handsome dwelling erected
in the northern part of town, it is
now under construction and will
soon have the finishing touches put
on. Mr. and Mrs. Goodson will move
in as soon as it is completed.
The town is having the streets in
the north and western portion clayed.

town and the convenience of the public.
It is work that has been needed
for a long time. It affords a good in*
vitation to the auto owner for breaking
the speed limit.
The public at large wishes tc
thank the county for its recent work
v on the roads in this vicinity of the
county made by the chain gang. They
\.are in fine condition and it is a pleasN
ure to go out now on a joy ride or
to do any hauling over them. You
are highly complimented by many as
an expert road builder. V
Last Wednesday morning while
several \>f their "dears" were at, oi
preparing to visit the fair, Rev. J,
R. Smith, Messrs. J. C. Kinard, J. F.
Chassereau, and F. H. Copeland armed
with guns, plenty of buck shot
cartridges and two of Mr. G. B
Kearse's best hound dogs, boarded
Rev. Smith's car and proceeded tc
the hunting grounds near Jacksonboro,
on a "deer" hunt. They arrived
in due time and soon some were
on'their stands while others went or
. the drive. They found plenty 01
* -/ "deer," jumping four witji only one
going close enough to the stands t(
be shot. This was a seven-pronf
buck; he was shot by both Messrs
Copeland and Chassereau, and fel
on the spot. They both being olc
hunters and having each killed -i
"deer" before, there was no initiatini
t.o be done. Messrs. Copeland an<
Chassereau own a large interest ii
this deer reserve and they were high
ly pleased to find it abundantly sup
plied with game. During the excite
ment and hurry to get home one o
the dogs was left, a white and blacl
spotted hound. Any one of the part;
will pay a nice reward for the dog';
recovery. They arrived home abou
eight o'clock p. m., same day, am
surprised their "dears" (who wen
just returning from the fair) b;
having baged a "deer."

true, but there are plenty left a

GOVERNOR SENDS TROOPS
FIVE COMPANIES COAST ARTILLERY
UNDER ORDERS.
Manning Says He Exhausted Every
Means Before Calling Out
Troops.
Columbia, Nov. 10.?Governor R.
I. Manning tonight ordered five companies
of coast artillery to proceed to
Anderson immediately to assist civil
authorities there in carrying out the
orders of the court in ejecting striking
"mill operatives of the Equinox
mill from houses and in enforcing
the law. The governor ordered Major
William F. Robertson, commanding
the battalion of coast artillery,
to proceed to Anderson and take
command. He also telegraphed
Commander Hassell W. Crouch, of
Charleston, commanding the four divisions
of naval militia, to hold his
companies in readiness to answer a
call immediately. The five companies
of coast artillery are located
at Greenville, Greenwood, Spartanburg,
Jonesville and Gaffney, and
comprise about 250 men. They will
go heavily armed and will be equip!
ped with tents and all necessary field
| equipment. The decision of the governor
to send the National Guard into
Anderson to preserve order and enable
the civil authorities to carry out
the orders of the court, came after all
the civil processes had been exhausted.
The militia companies at once
assembled in their armories ana are
proceeding to Anderson. The governor
ordered the necessary railroad
equipment made ready.
To Reach Anderson Today.
By daybreak tomorrow 250 soldiers
will be in Anderson under command
of Major -Robertson ready to
carry out the orders of the governor.
Governor Manning had started to
Greenwood to fill an engagement, but
on receipt of Sheriff Ashley's telegram
from Anderson he caught the
train back and reached his office late
in the afternoon. He at once wired
the Anderson sheriff that his telegraphic
reply to his order of this
morning was "insolent" and he then
commanded the militia to be sent into
Anderson to preserve order and
carry out the orders of the court.
Manager Ligon, of the Eq,uinox mills,
said strikers were preventing people
from working in the mill and \the
situation was so threatening that a
riot was imminent. He appealed for
the governor to afford him protection
and to uphold the laws, that
deputy sheriffs who were on the
scene failed to afford the protection.
He described the "cursing and disorderly
conduct in the public street"

cursed and abus^i and further that
the disorders at the mill occurred in
the presence of "women and children
and the two deputies."
To See Law Enforced.
Governor Manning made it plain
tonight that he intended to see that
law and order is preserved in Anderson.
"Having exhausted every means at
my command to have the civil authorities
uphold the law and enforce
the mandates of the courts, and having
met with refusal and defiance
from the sheriff, who is the highesl
peace officer in the county, there was
no other course for me to pursue bul
to call on the militia to protect the
civil officers in the performance ol
their duties, to uphold the dignity ol
the law and to enforce the mandates
of the court."

REPUBLICANS CAN'T CONTROL.
i,.;
G. O. P. Prevails in House and Democrats
in the Senate.
Washington, Nov. 12.?Members of t
the house of representatives in the
newly-elected Sixty-fifth congress
face one of the most uncertain or- >S
ganization situations in the history
of the government.
With a few districts still in doubt,
the Republicans appear to have a plurality
of four or five members and a
possible majority of two or three
when it is figured that an Indeoend
ent
elected in Massachusetts and a
Progressive elected in Minnesota
probably will vote with them for. organization
purposes. Independence
of action nas characterized a number
of the reelected members of the
? k
Republican side, however, and their y
attitude toward Democratic legislation
in the last few years has given
Democratic leaders cause for hope
that some of them might cptrry their
independence into the organization
of the next house.
't*
Close Division.
On the face of the unofficial returns
the political division of the
house is so close that an effective and V|
certain working majority does not
exist. While there might be a few ; *changes
when the official returns are
counted, the chances are that these y
would not materially alter tlie general
result. In view of the situation,
it is regarded by Democratic
leaders as improbable that President
Wilson will call an extra session of
the new congress next spring. In
that case the organization fight will
not come until the regular session in
December, 1917, which will mean
manoeuvering for more than a year
in the contest for the speakership of '
the house and the organization of important
committees. x / I
