How it Happened.
We are cleaned, the Captain shouted, as
he staggered to the bar; give me a Wilson
cocktail, 'cause he kept us out of war.
We fit them all right valiantly, and gave
them all we had; but it'? an awful story
for me to tell to dad. A couple a good
big reasons why we couldn't get their
goat, was Henry Flivver's bankroll and
the suffragette vote. New York stood
up right nobly, and so did Illinois; but
Kansas, she went crazy, and California
made some noise. .. : . .,
