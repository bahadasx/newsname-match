Give Whitefly Larvae a Little Oil
A few growers have sprayed
for the fall brood of whitefly. The
whitefly should not be neglected
since it saps the life out of trees
and not only weakens the tree but
impairs the ripening of fruit. The
combined methods of fighting
whitefly are necessary to keep
the pest in control.
J. R. Watson, entomologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Station, recommends that
those growers who have not spray
ed do so at once. November is a
little late, but a great deal of pro
tection may be had even that late.
Several instances of effective
spraying in early November are
on record.
Oil emulsion or soap solution,
1 pound of soap to 4 or 5 gallons
of. water, will be effective. The
spray should be directed to the
under sides of the leaves where
the whitefly larvae wil be found.
The work must be thoro since
each larvae must be hit to be killed.
Performance . Records Eliminate
Unprofitable Trees
The value of permormance re
cords for citrus trees is twofold,
according to a recent lecture at
the University of Florida by Leo
B. Scott, Bureau of Plant Indus
try. In the first place they en
able the grower to distinguish be
tween the productive and the non
productive trees. They place the
trees on the credit or debit side of
the ledger. That a great many
trees are on the wrong side for
profit to their owner is shown by
the low average for the state. The
average state yield is about a box
to the tree. Trees of low perfor
mance are responsible for this low
average.
A few growers have inaugurat
J
of Agriculture. Mr. Sherman
spoke at the University of Flori
da a few week:i ago on marketing
problems and the work which his
division is doing for fanners.
These tomato growers have a mo
nopoly of the Unvkft at ccrtnm
times, yet ther-; is no .guiding
hand from this end to effort ivo
distribution,
The product is drawn by the
market and not pushed by the
growers. The demand is not large
enough, in the. , opinion of Mr
Sherman. Growers should endeav
or to create demands by widen
ing their distribution , They do
not receive the prices which would
be paid if they worked other mar
kets. Every grower attempts to
sell m the larger markets, and as
a result the smaller cities are not
supplied.
Mr. Sherman said that the of
fice had a man look over the field
in the tomato section and his re
port showed promising results for
organization. It is up to the
growers to make the first move,
however. The office with all its
forces stands ready to help the
Florida tomato growers, and the
results which have been obtained
in other states and districts indi
cate that their help means greater
profits and sometimes success in
stead of failure if marketing prob
lems stand in the way. The of
fice is busy and consequently does
not seek the growers. The initia
tive must come from the tomato
sections.
Health and Appearance
Have a Real Relationship
,Now that the political horizon
has been cleared from the quad
rennial spasm, there is time for
attention to matters more person
al and perhaps less patriotic.
Florida is peculiar, different
from other sections of the United
States in the fact that horticul
tural exertion with the hoe and
rake and other garden implement
may be made profitably in this
section when nature is taking a
rest in other parts of the land.
Flowers bloom somewhere in Flor
ida the year round. Foliage hangs
on the trees the winter through
and never is there here the deso
late forlonness that cold weather
brings through the northern win
ter. Theso are advantages that
should be stressed both for the
bentfit of Floridians themselves
Station Experiments With Wood

look at the horticulture grounds,

plant kingdom are on trial there.

pal to new varieties of plants

found that many trees are loafing
B. E. Evans, agent for the Univer
sity of Florida Extension Division
in Osceola county, has kept rec
ords for a year on several hundred
citrus trees. Records for one
year are not sufficient upon which
to draw conclusions or to elimi
nate trees, but these show the pro
duction of those several hund
dred trees to range from nothing
to sixteen boxes.
The second point in favor of
performance records is in helping
growers to select budwood. Cit
rus trevs transmit their character
istics of production and quality of
fruit to thefrbuds. Buds taken
from trees which produce large
quantities of good quality fruit,
will give trees with the produc
tion qualities of their parents. Re
peated experiments have shown
not only this but that heavy pro
ducing branches always transmit
their characteristics thru the
buds.
Its up to the Tomato Growers
"One of the best fields for ef
fective organization in the United
States exists among Florida toma
to growers." This ,is the opinion
of Wells a Sherm in of the Office
of Markets and Rural Organiza
tions, United Spates Department
their merits before they are intro
duced to the public. One of the
latest importations to itself is a
Chineso wood-oil tree, Aleurites
fordii.
Several of these trees were sent
to the Experiment Station from
California in 1912. This year is
the first time they have borne.
Ihey are deciduus and seem to
stand the winter well. In fact
they are grown -" frv now'- ns
Augusta. Ga. b
According to F. F. Halnia, as
sistant horticulturist, who has
charge of the destinies of the ini
migrants, these trees are still in
the experimental stage. Since
this is their first crop, no predic
tions can be made concerning their
ability to bear and produce pro
fits. 1 he fruits are nuts, .sever
al of which are, borne in a single
shell. They are grown in China
for the oil which the nut meats
yield. The meats are extremely
tat. Aiucn ot the oil used in
treating woods and in tho manu
facture of wood preservatives and
polishes comes from this nut.
A few nurseries are selling the
trees, but it is not advisable to
plant them on expensive land un
til then usefulness is more thoroly
tested. It is probable that a mar
ket for the raw product would
have to be created in this country.

whether such district shall be
created and a special tax levied to

and for their winter visitors.
The connection between health
and appearances may not loom up
big, but it is a real relationship.
No person attracts attention by
good looks unless he is all right in
side. It is the bloom of vigoro
us health that makes the beauti:
ful face or form. And the same is
true of the city or village or the
home and its surroundings. If the.
lawns are scraggly and the foli
age untrimmed, something is
wrong with the mental works of
the authorities or with the home
keeper or owner. "The cleanli
ness which is next to Godliness
doesn't stop with the bath and
washing the front windows."
In Florida, as everywhere else,
life is one continuous scramble to
keep what we have health as
well as tho other possessions, and
the other possessions aren't worth
much without health. In time of
peace prepare for war. Tn winter
prepare to make the fight for
health a little less strenuous next
summer. After you have made
the home and its surroundings so
beautiful that the casual visitor
will stop in his rambling to admire
them, get busy inside the house
and do some things that may not
show, but that will count later on,
just the same.
Sometimes we are surprised in
the dead of a Florida winter to
hear the buzzing of a lonely mos
quito. We are surprised because
we weren't expecting such a vis
itor, lyit the chances are that there
are more where that one came
from. For the mosquito hides in
dark closets or other comparative
ly warm places and is ready to go
into the breeding business with
the coming of warm weather next
spring.
Then some kinds of mosquitoes
carry the germs of infection for
surprisingly long periods'. Exper
iments under artificially favor
ably conditions have kept the vel-
low fewr germ alive in the mos
quito for 80 days. While there
is little probability that the insect
will carry active infection through
the winter, the pest does live from
season to season, and the winter is
a perfectly good time to rout her
out of her hiding places and get
rid of her.
Because cooler weather is com
ing or is already here is no reason
why our energies against the fly
should be lesencd. One out of the
way now means a housand or a
million less next summer. When
we realize fully that the fly is tho
most persistent, the most filthy
and about the most destructive
companion wo have and almost
the most intimate, and realizing
it act, as if it meant something to
us, we will have solved in a prac
tical way one of the greatest
health problems. And this fight,
to be successful, must be a contin
uous performance. We can't take
vacations from it in winter.
Health and appearances go
hand in hand; to neglect the lat
ter is to threaten the former. And
appearances are a rather depend
able sign , of prosperity. Poor,
careless dressing indicates lack
of prosperity, and whether it's tho
clothes or the yard or the street
in front, let them all show our
winter visitors that Florida is
both prosperous and healthy.
