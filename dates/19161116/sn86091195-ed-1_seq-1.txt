BLACKFOOT ^ IDAHO
LET US ALL
GIVE THANKS
From the time of the landing of the
Pilgrim Fathers, Americans have been
accustomed to set aside one day in the
year wherein to review the past year
and take stock of the dealings of
Providence with us as a people.
What was at first the spontaneous
expression of grateful hearts soon be
came a custom, and aa the years sped
this customo became f-od, until to
day it assumes the suere .ness of a per
manent. institution.
This season is again « ith us. Tha
fruits of the broad aci « of our fair
domain have been gari e.-ed in. Tho
warehouses and granaries are fairly
bursting with their contents and pros
perity sets a guest at almost every
fireside.
Our president and the governors of
various states have designated the day
on which the people shall express to a
bountiful Creator their gratitude for
these blessings.
And to the many positive anil materi
al blessings which have been ours,
there is added on this occasion the es
pecial blessing that we as a people
have escaped the madness that has
fallen as a blight upon our neighbors
and kinsmen across the waters. The
magnitude of that blessing we cannot ah
this time begin to estimate.
But while we have these palpable
blessings for which to lie thankful,
we have other things for which to ex
press our gratitude, and these nntedate
and underlie our present happiness and
prosperity, our peace and safety. Wo
have to be thankful that back in the
days when our nation was being born,
a land of heroes, than whom the world
has never produced greater, had im
pressed upon their hearts to lay the
foundations of that, nation upon the
only possible true and lasting base—
the Fatherhood of an omnipotent God
and the brotherhood of man.
Ami we have to be thankful that, all
down the years since that time there
have been heroic souls—worthy sons of
noble sires-—who have never ceased to
call to us with clarion voice to watch
and preserve the old landmarks, to
plant our feet upon the everlasting
rock and stand firm.
And over and above all i-Ihc, we have
to be thankful that a merciful God inis
ho moulded the hearts and lives of
the people of this nation that we are
enabled to look above and beyond self
ami see for ourselves the great, princi
ples of eternal truth and justice that
must ultimately rule the whole earth;
that we are enabled to grasp the truth
that an injury to ourselves, anil that
a kindness to our fellows calls down a
benediction upon our heads.
Bo that the one supreme blessing
for which we should at this season re
turn thanks, is the fact that our Goil
has enabled us as a people to know ami
to <lo the light.
And let our prayer be, that it may
ever lie thus with nur ......pie.
Announcement!

we will paint any Overland Car pur
chased from us, any color to suit pur
