Officials Believe Interference

By ROBERT J. BENDER
(United 1'ress Staff Correspondent)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16. The Ad
ministration is ready to start an ag
gressive fight in behalf of the Adam
son Eight-Hour Law, now the object
of the concerted attacks of the big
railroads of the country, It was made
clear today. Belief was expressed by
high officials that the efforts to en
join the operation 01 me law worn a
fail. It was suggested that the Gov
ernment might not confine its efforts
to defensive tactics if the hope of the
railroads to prevent the operation of
the law should appear likely of reali
zation. If the railroads tie up the en
forcement of the act, the railroad
workers are expected to strike.
It is the view of some of President
Wilson's closest advisers that the
courts would hold the railroads re
sponsible for Interference with inter
state commerce in such cases and
compel them to provide for the con
ditions of the act. They hold the
view that the Adamson law primarily
Is a measure designed to provide a
thorough and scientific investigation
of facts on which to base final legis
lation. It is to be effective only six
months, during the time of investiga
tion of the application of the eight-
hour day. It can be extended only
three months at the request of the
special commission appointed under it.
By reason of the very nature of the
act, efforts to enjoin its operation will
fail, they think. On the other hand
it Is thought it may be possible to en
" join "Interference" on the part at the
railroads with interstate traffic, as la
bor leaders were enjoined in the Pull
man strike twenty years ago.

Employers Organize to Fight Law.
By United Press
NEW YORK, Nov. 16. Prospects
for a great -industrial struggle be
tween capital and labor are increasing
today because of the situation arising
from the railroads' determination to
fight the Adamson law by the forma
tion of a vast organization of em
ployers, known as the National Indus
trial Conference Board.
This new body will represent $8.
000,000.000 of capital and employ 7,
000,000 persons, and it proposes that
industrial legislation be watched more
closely, that legislators be guided by
public opinion and that legislation fa
vorable to labor and fatal to capital
be eliminated. It will fight such meas
ures as the Adamson Eight-Hour Law.
Its leaders say Jhat the election show
ed no labor vote, so that politicians
need not curry the favor of labor
leaders as they have in the past

"P. & SCIENCE LEADS IX IDEALS"
Prof. John 31. Coulter Defends Na
tion's Researches In Address.
"No here in the world are the ideals
of the scientist higher and nearer real
isation than in the United States," said
Prof. John M. Coulter of the Univer
sity of Chicago in his address in the
Agricultural Auditorium last night
Professor Coulter Is a botany special
ist and was brought here by Sigma XI,
nonorary scientific fraternity.
"The Ideals of the Scientist" was
Ws subject
"Scientists should try to extend the
boundaries of knowledge, by knowing
nature because it is wonderful and
vorth knowing," he said. "This is
the ideal that makes all our explora
tion worth while. No scientist should
Wve only for material gain.
"The goal of the second ideal Is ser
tfee to mankind. Men are learning
to know and then to do. There is a
lew spirit in our universities.
"A more effectice citizenship is the
Wal of the third Ideal. A scientific
attitude of mind Is nothing more than
trained common sense, and I believe
science can effectively develop this.
However, all education should include
both science and the humanities. Any
cneme without both results in mental
"Stortion."
Professor Coulter's address was
Prepared for the City Club of Chicago

Department of Landscape Gardening
Will Have Display Next Month.
This year's exhibition by the de
partment of landscape gardening of
the University includes many large
water color plates, photographs of
plans, including playgrounds, parks
and prhate estates. Among the ex
hibitors will be L. P. Jense, superin
tendent of the Bush Estate; John No
len, considered the greatest city plan
ner of modern times and O. C. Si
monds, who planned and developed
the Graceland Cemetery of Chicago.
This cemetery is considered the most
beautiful in the United States.
Many other architects and land
scape artists of national repute will
be listed later. The exhibit will be
hung in Room 107 and adjacent halls
of the University Library the -first
two weeks of December. Recently
part of the exhibit was on display at
the City Club in St Louis and at the
City Planning Convention In Cleve
land. The exhibit will be open during the
evenings, and some one will be pres
ent to explain the displays.

ened an ofllce in Jefferson City and
will continue the propaganda.
A most important result of the com
mittee's work has been obtaining in
dorsement from the state conventions
of the Democratic, Republican, Prohi
bition and Progressive parties of the
submission by the next General As
sembly to the voters of Missouri of the
question of calling a constitutional
convention. j
The committee believes that it Is
probable that the next General As
sembly will pass a bill for an elec
tion on the question. If so, a cam
paign wiu De made throughout the
state for a convention. If this cam
paign is successful and the majority
of the votes cast at the special elec
tion are in favor of a convention, a
second election must be held to choose
delegates, two from each senatorial
district, to the convention. When n
new' constitution is framed by the del
egates thus chosen it must be submit
ted to the voters" for their approval or
rejection.
The provision of the present state
constitution as to its amendment is

The Columbia chapter of the. P. E.

Since the founding of this organiza

there Is $35,000 available for the fund.
A board of examiners investigates the
cases of those applying for loans. In
order to secure a loan the girl must
be over eighteen years old, have the
equivalent of a high school education,
and promise to use the money only
for obtaining an education.
"The organization, which has the

plan is to build an entirely new plant,

Mr. Grimes added that the appeal Is
being made to Columbians and Boone-'

.. u,auBa m lne great war.
Battling against snow and rain, over
great mountains, the Allies are rmr
near Monastir and today the official
communicant from Paris, partially
confirmed by Berlin statements. Indi
cates the sweeping back of the Bulgarian-Teutonic
line to a noint with
in four miles of 'Monastir.
The Berlin admission was that the
retreat was to "prepare new positions"
in the Cerna sector. The new dosI-
tions achieved by the Allies are the
result of two desparate flanking move
ments. The first involved the lines
along the bend of the Cerna to the
east of Monastir and westward, and
was successful. With practically all
of Cerna forces back in place, the Al
lies are again striking out to force the
Teutons further backward. Thi i
the second abandonment of positions
near Monastir admitted by the Berlin
office.
On the western front the Allies are
fighting steadily, and the new assault
during the night found the French
successful in dislodging a German
force from Perssoire. The weight of
the German counter attack was indi
cated In the French notice. The Teu
tons threw three full divisions against
the French lines.
