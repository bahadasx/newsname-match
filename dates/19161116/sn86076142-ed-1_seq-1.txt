government to make a declaration
in the nature of a "ton for ton

her allies, as a reply to "the mon
strous proceedings" of tbe German
submarines. He declared that there
was an uneasy feeling in the country
that the submarine menace was more
serious than the authorities were
willing to admit.
Admiral Lord Beresford said that
Great Britain had arrived at a serious
crisis, calling for energy and fore

and the newspapers had been muzzled
by the most autocratic government
since the time of Pharaoh.
"Had the blockade been properly
enforced from the first," he asserted,
"we should not have been faced by
this submarine menace."
The marquis of Crewe, lord presi
dent of the council, replying for the
government, said It was useless to
make such declarations as Lords
Sydenham and Beresford demanded,
without the power to enforce them.
The only voices which would speak
with influence now were the voices
of the cannon on the various fronts.
"It is useless," said the marquis
of Crewe, "to threaten to exact par
ticular reparations in tbe terms of
peace unless, we are able to impose
those terms by obtaining complete
victory." ,
The admiralty, continued the lord
president, "had been singularly suc
cessful in the destruction of enemy
submarines, but the difficulties in
dealing with this menace have been
increased."

BERLIN, Nov 16 (By wireless to
the Associated Press via Sayvllle).
The report that the steamer Missis
sippi of the Compagnie Generate
Transatlantique used its guns against
a German submarine which neither
before nor after the attack attempted
to molest the liner, is considered
here as furthering contradiction to
the affirmation of the entente gov
ernments that the armaments of
merchantmen are for defensive pur
poses only.
The Matin and other French papers,
according to information reaching
here, published on Nov. 12 the re
port of Captain Colbeaux of the
Mississippi, 'which cleared from the
American port of New Orleans on
October 15 (sailed October 19) for
Havre. When In the English channel
on November 8 a big submarine was
sighted at a distance of 300 meters,
headed westward at full speed. "Cap
tain Colbeaux," says the report, "im
mediately maneuvered his steamer so
that the stem of the vessel was in
line with the enemy and ordered the
crew to battle stations. 1 When he
judged the favorable moment had
arrived he ordered a shell fired, which
unfortunately missed. The fire was
discontinued,' for the submarine pur
sued her course without evidencing;
any intention to engage In combat."
The Matin adds: "Captain Col
beaux has presented a report of this
incident to the naval authorities."

Nevada Spuds to Advertise
Nevada Farm Advantages
The Southern Pacific Is going to
advertise Itself by advertising Nev
ada spuds. This decision was reached
recently at a conference of dining car
superintendents with the manage
ment. The reason Is obvious when
It Is understood that Nevada potatoes
command a premium wherever they
are introduced. The dining car de
mand will absorb a large proportion
of the Nevada selected stock, for the
men entrusted with the task of cater
ing to the whims of rich travelers
will not have anything but the best
This best stock must be selected and
standardized. The npuds must not
weigh over ten or eleven ounces
each, be of uniform size and shape
nd present no unsightly ridges or
RUlches. In other words, the spud
must have the marks of arUtorracy,
tor It must be soft skinned, trans
parent, starchy and moulded In the
Class of fashion.
This announcement was made yes
'riay by r. E. Uatturs. general
Pacific, who arrived in Tonopah,
accompanied by J. M. Fulton, assist
ant general freight and passenger
agent of the same road for Nevada.
Mr. Batturs Is making his first trip
to this section of the railroad system
and is delighted with the proofs of
prosperity found on every side be
tween Tonopah and the main line.
This morning both Rentlemen left for
Mlna, whore they will take a special
train for a trip over the narrow
gauge In Keeler, spending tonight at
tltshop.
"You csn stste for the Southern
Pacific that we are ready to pay $50
a ton for spuds delivered at any
rallrimd station on our lines In
Nevada," remarked Mr. Fulton, speak
Ins for himself and aanoclule. "All
that e require Is that the spuds
conform to the requirements of the
dining car service and are assorted
This means ft 50 a bushel for pota
toes on the farm and t don't know
of any other proposition that csn
passenger agent of the Souther equal It In say part of the world
The Belling price of spuds is nomi
nally $40, but we are willing to pay
premium for the sake of grading
up the stock and getting the exact
quality we are after. It is to our
interest to cultivate the potato and
to have the potato cultivated along
our lines, for it means an important
Item In developing traffic.
Last year the Southern Pacific
handled 1000 cars of potatoes and
we expect to double this quantity by
next fall. We have Mr. C. F. Brown
traveling freight and passenger agent
visiting every section of the state
with a view to promoting this Indus
try and Interesting farmers In de
veloping what may become one of
the chief InduBtrlws of Nevada. In
the past year the exports increased
nearly fifty per cent and nothing less
than 100 per rent gain will satisfy
us next year. The best potatoes
come from Yerlngton, but the farmers
of Mlnden, Fallon and around Reno
are waking up to the opportunity and
will plant big crops next jreer."

Mineral Development Only
An Orgy of Exploitation
(Br Aaaorlatrd Prraa.)
CHICAGO, Nov. 16. The develop
ment of the mineral resources of the
United States was described as an
orgy of hasty exploitation by Van H.
Manning, director of the bureau of
mines, addressing the American Min
ing congress today.
"Great as has been the advance in
the mining Industry," he said, "it is
deplorable to have to say that it has
been carried on in a most wasteful
manner and with little regard for the
safety of the men who labor in tbe
mines.
"Had our mineral resources been
wisely developed, they would have
laBted many years longer and yielded
ten times as much wealth.
"The chief need ,of the United
States if it would meet new condi
tions of trade is a deeper and wider
co-operation among our industries
and tbe elimination of factionalism
and sentimentalism."

Assertions that the German sub

whereon were several Americans,
fired on lifeboats containing the crew.
is dismissed as utterly false in the
report of the commander of the sub

the Rowanmore owe their lives to
the precautions taken by the Ger

twenty minute pursuit of the steam
ship, the submarine's shots wore
aimed accurately astern to limit
danger to the crew, which congre
gated forward. The ship was hit ten
