of leading these youngsters to apprec

Dark Colors For Walls and Woodwork

The Interior decorations of a man's

domestic happiness or tmhuppiness, as
the case may bo, according to the sec
rotary of the International Association
of Master House Piiintf is and Decora,
tors. Tin- depressing effect of dark
colors in wood tlnisli and wall paper
has wrecked homes which would have
been happy had the colors boon bright,
is the opinion of this export.
"Dark colors in homo decoration are
like dark, gloomy day in thoir effect
on people," he said. "It is well known
that gloomy days are commonly known
to the police as 'suicide days.' There
are many more suicides, murders and
other crimes on rniny days. A man
owes it to his family to surround it
with bright rooms which will catch all
the sunlight there is and turn If into
domestic happiness.
"A room done in d;irl; colors has the

Evangelist Tells Boston to Kick
Her Evil Forces Into Hell
GRAFF IS STRINGING RELIGION
So-Called Respectable People are
Renting Property for Immoral
Purposes.
Boston, Nov. 15. The rum traffic,
the people's indilference to it and a
host of other evils were hotly scored
tonight by Billy Sunday before more
than 14,000 people who filled the im
mense tabernacle. He warmly prais
ed the Jews, culling them the greatest
financiers in the world. According to
the evangelist there is not a crowned
bead in Europe who does not owe the
Jews. "Some of them are the boat
citizens we have," he said, "and they
are the most abused. 1 say all hail to
the Jews."
The groat revivalist showed just as
much pep tonight as he did the lire
vlous evening, and when driving home
a point would wax warm, jumping
from one end of the rostrum to the
other fairly screeching his words.
"The revival at Pentecost" was the
If ARRAIGNMENT
subject of the afternoon. According
to Mr. Sunday the revival at Pente
cost was not a man-gotten up revival.
There was no cut-and-dried schedule
to it, he said. The afternoon attend
ance was mado up mostly of women,
and the great evangelist's delivery
was somewhat tamer than usual. He
Impressed his hearers just as effec
tively, however.
The subject of his evening sermon
was taken from Genesis." As a prince
thou hast power with God and with
man, and hast prevailed." He called
the sermon "Jacob's confossion." He
said:
"It is not neoepssry for me to con
sume my energy and your time giv
ing you the story' of Jacob. There u
no character in the Old Testament
with whom the average man or wom
an Is more familiar than with that of
Jacob. He has been called by some
one 'the Peter of the Old Testmont.'
The history of Jacob is largely the
history of the Jewish nation in
epitome.
"The Jews are a wonderful people.
They are the greatest financiers on
earth. You will never find a Jewish
lather and mother in a poorhouse liv
ing on ,th6 county. There 's not a
crowned head in Europe that doesn't
owe something to the Jews. There's
hardly a nionach's cabinet has hasn't
a Jew in it. They are shrewd, capa
ble business people. One of them gave
his blood to save us. George Wash
ington had throe Jews on his staff.
You never see a Jew among the ho
boes, panhandling and mooching you
for a handout. You seldom hoar of
a Jew committing a crime. Some of
them are the best citizens we have
and they ore the most abused. I say,
all hail to tlo Jew.
"Much in the life of Jacob corre
sponds with things in our life; that
is, we find things in our life which
are analogous with things In his life.
He speaks to us in bis sorrow. I pre
sume there are very few people here
who have not in thoir homes some
memento of affection, esteem and love
which reminds you of other days and
other places, long since past.
"There is many a fellow trying to
work some shell game on God today
to build a church or put a rich car
pot on the floor in the alcove of God's
church today, instead of saying to
God, '1 am a sinner and deserve hell.'
He hopes to be saved and is trying
to appease God with some contribu
tion to the church or something of
that sort. No matter who will pray,
If he will pray with honest heart God
will hear.
After the duke of Wellington had
returned from the battle of Waterloo
thoy had a special service of thanks
giving In the Episcopal churches.
When Wellington went in he knelt
down in front and down the aisles
came a man with the marks of pov
erty and hardship, evidently illiterate
from his countenance, and he knelt by
the side of the great duke, of Wel
lington. "You. you little buck-wart, turn up
your nose when you are asked to pray
when the greatest men in tlio world
have always piayed daily.
"And the kid-gloved usher came up
and touched him and said. 'Don't
kneel so close,' and the duko of Well
ington turned and said: 'When we
kneel before God there are no dukes
or kings or queeiiB. All earthly dis
tinctions are eliminated. We all come
as sinners seeking salvation or as chll
dren seeking a blessing.' In this city
we have men who can wiito their
checks for a big sum, but these
checks are not worth a picayune in
heaven. This is a serious business,
and Boston must take graft, corrup
tion and other evil forces by the
throat and kick them into hell.
"We can start with red whisky.
TO BE PHYSICALLY EXAMINED
Bodily Condition of Y. M. C. A. Mem
bers To Be Ascertained.
In order to be thorough in the de
velopment of its members the Y. M.
C. A. will give each member a free
physical examination. The purpose
of examination are:
1 To provide not only knowledge
of actual conditions but also some
form of motivation such as stimulus
to improved health or appearance or
preparation for some special line of
development.
2 To determine the general physi
cal condition as a basis for advice
and counsel.
3 To discover the present condi
tions, physically.
4 To discover the present needs
5 To guide In an intelligent appli
cation of the work to meet these con
ditions and needs.
This examination will tell the mem
bers whether they are under or over
weight according 'to their age and
height, which is a vital significance
to health and development.
The most authoritative material
with regard to height and weight in
relation to health and symmetrical
growth is that gathered by life insur
ance companies, using Dr. Shepard's
table based on 74,102 premium hold
ers.
In general the lowest death rate is
found in the class 5. per cent below
standard weight. Records of death
show that the probability of dying at
the ago of 30 is .00821. Because of
the medical selection tho death rates
of those Insured ate usually lowered.
In the Actuary Society tables the
death rate at the age of 31 shews that
828 out of 100,000 are found to die.
Overweight and Its significance is
shown in tho following mortality
table:
Moderate Excessive
Age Overweight Overweight
15-28 (young) SO p. c. 88 p. c.
29-42 (mature) 102 p. c. 124 p. c.
43-5(5 (elderly) 133 p. c. 12 p. c.
07-70 (old) 125 p. c. 156 p. c.
Overweight aggravates weaknesses
of the body and therefore it is a vital
significance to the symmetrical de
velopment. These examinations will be taken
at periods which will enable the mem
bers to observe their actual muscular
development as well as their organic
development.
GAVEL OF MORRILL MAPLE
f
Presented to Association of American
-Agricultural Colleges.
An Interesting episode in the open
ing exercises of the convention of the
Association of American Agricultural
Colleges and Experiment Stations at
Washington, D. C, yesterday was the
presentation of a gavel made from tho
wood of a sugar maple tree planted
many years ago on his lawn at Staf
ford by the late Senator Justin S.
Morrill. This gavel was made from
a limb of the tree which was wrested
apart in a stotm In September, 1915,
the wood being selected by Dean J.
W.' Votey of Uie College of Engineer
ing of the University of Vermont, The
gavel was shaped in the college shops
and suitably inscribed as to Us origin.
It was presented In behalf of the Uni
versity of Vermont by Dean J. L. Hills
who for the last twelve years has
been secretary-treasurer of the as
sociation. It will be remembered
that Senator Morrill was the father
of the state universities and land
grant colleges of the country, and
that the original enactment In 1862
which founded these institutions was
ttie product of his brain, and on every
state college campus the country
over his name is honored. It is cer
tainly very fitting that this central
oignnlaztion should possess this his
torical gavel.
Red whisky and the church have noth
ing in common. You don't have to
break a law to be a force in the com
munity, but the preachers can force
their pious men and women to stop
renting property to the rumsellcr.
Don't say you don't know what your
agent is doing; God holds you respon
sible. Graft has got a strangle hold
in religion and the church. Graft has
gagged and hound tho church.
"I have known of labor leaders,
walking delegates, to threaten a strike
unless a contractor came across with
money. It is tho same way with tho
saloon. So-called gentlemen and
ladles rent their property to dive
keepers and rum men. Thoy are no
more to be respected than tho un
fortunate prostitute. Try to hide be
hind that, you mutts.
"Seventy-five per cent of money
invested In tho drug business is used
for purposes that are breeding weak,
small, anemic children. The waste
from the breweries is being made into
breakfast foods. Decomposed meat Is
being made into sausage, rotten f;its
into butter and glucose Into maple
syrup.
"My friend, the socialist, says thr.:
poverty breeds crime. There Is truth
in that. Hut lemeniber, I am no so
cialist. I answer him by saying 'Crima
breeds poverty, and it is up to tho
church and the people of this city to
answer the call of God and enlist lor
service, that wo may drive the forces
of evil from our city and kill both
crime and poverty."

health officers that the quarantine pe
riod of two weeks imposed on children
who came to Vermont from New York
has been removed, except in the cases
of children who have been living in
areas that still are infected or who
have been exposed to infantile paraly
sis. Since the epidemic began to ap
proach its height In New York more
than four months ago every child com
ing into Vermont from the Empire
state has . been required to remain in
quarantine for a fortnight and to have
its nose irrigated with a solution rec
ommended by specialists. The order
to relax the quarantine measure came
when health authorities were assured
that the epidemic had spent its force

Attempt to Stop Deer Hunting on
Large Area.
Brattleboro, Nov. 14. Declaring
that out-of-town hunters have abused
every privilege possible for years, 17
owners of contiguous farm lands in
the towns of Guilford and Vernon
have posted their property and intend
to prosecute any hunters found upon
them.
One of the men who has posted his
farm says that he saw, three deer kill
ed on his farm by non residents of the
town in one day last year and that he
drew the deer In with hla team and
was not rewarded oven with a word
of thanks. Another farmer who had
been awaiting an opportunity to trap
some coons that had been feeding up
on his hoed crops throughout the sea
son found that a company of hunters
had cut down two trees and taken five
coons in one night.
Acting upon the theory that every
man is master of his own domain and
that he is entitled to at least one of
tho deer hl3 crops feed during the
year theso farmers have combined
and posted 3500 acres of hunting
ground and it is claimed that In an
other year practically all of the land
in the towns will have been posted.
USE OF FRENCH WORDS.
A Critic Scores This Habit of Somo
Writers of English.
"People who use French in English
writing are always those who don't
know French very well." John K Hal
dcrston writes In the Atlantic, report
ing a conversation with George Moore.
"Thoy use badinage for banter and
think there Is a shade of difference or.
1 suppose 1 should say. a nuance of
moaning. Then they write resume,
which thoy think more refined than
summary, and In society every woman
is tros rnllineo.
"I mot nn author who bad written
'small and petite,' and I asked him
why lie did it. lie said petite can
tnoiin dainty as well as small, nud I
said: "It cannot. It menus nothing but
6iuall. Rut in any case if you wanted
to siiv dainty why didn't you say dain
ty?' '
"In my newspaper I mot with on ex
ample of this tendency. . A dispatch
read something like this: 'The patriotic
citizens have been asked to give up
their gold ornaments and watches to
bo moiled down into coin unless thoy
are souvenirs.' A liuiri must bo with
out any aesthetic sense whatever to
write souvenir when he might hove
written koeisako. It has associations,
that word keepsake. It lives, breathes,
runs, Jumps, files. Hut souvenir in
English is a corpse."

'ONE DAY"
"Bobby Ramsay" of Chicago 8teali
the Main Role.
Although "Paul Zaleneska" was
heralded as the hero and Elinor Glyn
intended him to be the hero of "One
Day", which was produced at the
opera House Wednesday evening by
the Joseph W. Payton Stock company,
Edward Darney, playing "Bobby
Romany," whose father owned the
"State of Chicago", ran away with the
honors. Douglass Duinbrllle, as Paul
and Miss Russell, playing opposite
him as Opal Ledeux, were excellent,
hut Mr. Darney, while he had but a.
minor role, made the most of it and.
In the opinion of the host part of the
largo audience present, usurped tho

usual cleverness. The attraction this
evening will be "The Great Divide",
deservedly called the greatest play
