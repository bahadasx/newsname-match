Fourth Victim of. Assault and
Robbery Reported in Fash
ionable Cleveland Park.
MAKES. AWAY WITH $10.75
Detective Bureau Assigns Large
Force to Investigate Activ
ities of Highwaymen.
While pollen and detectives were
still scouring the city last night for
the hold-Up men who began a serios
of daring street jobberies here Satur
day night, a fourth person was hold
up, pssaunoii nnn ronncu ni n ionciy
spot 'In Porto street, Cleveland Pnrk,
shortly .after 7 o'clock.
Tho la'tcnl victim Is Alice Tllghman.
r. colored domestic at tho homo of
William R. Hlalr. 3120 Porter street
northwest. Her assailant, after striking
her two blows !n tho face, fled with
her purse containing J10.7B. her pay,
which she had Just received from her
employer, .
The presence In the city of thugs,
working at tho rate of four "Jobs" In
five days, has caused men and wom
en who must bo on the streets at
night to fear for their safety.
Aroused by the boldness of the
hold-up mgu, practically tho entire
force of Central Office and precinct
detectives are working day and night
to run them down.
Although It 1b practically certain
that the same two whlto men en
gineered the first two "Job's," the po
lice believe the third attack, made, en
Mrs. Anna M. Scherer In Kaloraina
road northwest Monday evening, was
the work of a ncgrp.
I Colored Man Released.
The colored man of Bladensburg.
Md arrested on suspicion, ln con
nection with tho Scherer case, was
released last night after he had been
grilled by Inspector Grant, chief of
datecttvoa.
Late last nTght Central Office De
tective Vermillion arrested another
negro on suspicion and he will be
questioned today. Tho police say lie
was In tho neighborhood of the scene
of the attack on Mrs. Scheier Monday
night, but denies that he was In Kal
oratna road. He is being held at the
First precinct.
Tho Tllghman girl, tho fourth victim,
was so frightened she was unable to
tell the detectives whether her assailant
was white or black or how ho was
dressed. The nearest sho could come
, to a description was that ho was of
medium height and stocky build.
On Way to Take Car. '
The colored girl told Detectives String
fellow, Uughlctt, Embrey, Weber, and
tjVermllllon, who hurried to tho scene,
that sho left Mr. Blair's home and was
walking along Porter street to got a
Connecticut avenue car, when a man
darted from tho other1 sldo of tho street,
and, in a husky voice, ordered hor to
throw ud her hands.
She was so frightened, she told tho
detectives, that she threw up her hands,
but screamed at tho same time. An
gered by her outcry, tho thug struck
her twice in the face. Sho says that as
she fell to the ground he snatched her
purso and disappeared Into the dark
ness. Tho detectives say the nearest light
to tho spot where, the colored girl was
held up Is more than a block away, 'and,
for this reason, they say they are not
, surprised that she was unable to dis
tinguish the features of her assailant.
Return to Scene.
Detectives Hughlett. and Strlngfel
low roturned to tho scene as soon as
it was light this morning to see If
the thug had left anv footprints In
the soft dirt at the edge of the side
walk and street.
From the meager description given,
the colored girl's assailant might be
one of the two who held up Luther
A. Acker at Tenth street and Massa
chusetts avenuo northwest Saturday
night, and Allen C. Jammnson In his
grocery store at 1200 Four-and-a-half
street southwest Sunday night.
From Acker tho thugs got $50. from
.lammeson J68. from Mrs. Scherer
about J6, and from the Tllghman girl
S10.7S. Mrs. Schorer, like the Tllgh
man girl, was unable to give even a
meager description of her assailant. .
Tti. iva m.n who hnlri un Acker and
Jammcson are described as follows: No. I

was shown for President Wilson today
In completo official Presidential returns
from fifty out of tho fifty-eight coun
ties In California tabulated by the Uni
ted Press. These figures tend to Indi
cate Wilson's minimum plurality over
Hughes will be between 3,700 and 3.K00,
unles sa vital error Is discovered In one

Tn tho fifty counties compiled, Hughe
has a total of 157,155 against 169,743
for Wilson. The same counties, on tho

COL. HARPER LEADS
FOR INAUGURAL HEAD
Believed Probable Choice of Presi
dent As Committee Chairman.
Col. Robert N, Harper, president of
tho District National Bank, Is looked
upon as tho probable choice of President
Wilson as chairman ot tho inaugural
coulmlttee.
Up to the present time the President
personally has given no attention to the
arrangements for his Inauguration, but
It 4s probable that he may discuss the
mnttor tomorrow with Vanco McCor
mlck, chairman of the Democratic na
tional committee, who will be a guest
at tho White House.
Strong pressuro Is being brought to
bear on friends of the President to
hove him agree to the holding of nn
inaugural ball. As far ns can be
learned in White House quarters,
however, the President has not Indi
cated anv change of heart toward an
Inaugural ball, which he vetoed at
the outset of his Administration.
As stated exclusively In The Wash
ington Times In the 5 o'clock edition
yesterday, the President probably will
take the oath of office on Sunday,
March 4, although the formal In
auguration ceremonies and the pa
rado will be held on the following
day.

OFFICIALS PREPARE CASE
Administration Plans Aggressive
' Action Seeking to. Enjoin In
terference by Roads.
It was made clear today that the Ad
ministration Is ready to start an ag
gressive fight In behalf of the Adamson
law, now object of concerted attack by
most of the big railroads of, tho coun
try. '
Ilellcf was expressed by high officials
that tho efforts to enjoin the operation
of tho law would fall.
Since, If the railroads tlo up enforce
ment of tho Adamson net, the railroad
workers aro expected to strike, Jt Is tho
view of atvnc of the President's direct
advisers In the present situation thnt
the courts would compel tho railroads
tcabldc by tho provisions of the net.
Only Effective Six Months.
This belief Is strengthened by the
fact that the Adamson law Is prlmalry
a mcasuro designed to obtain full and
nclciutlllu Investigation of facts on
which to bane legislation. It Is to be
effective only six months, during the
time f tho Investigation of the appli
cation of tho right-hour day. It can
bo extended only thirty ilays at the
request of the special commission ap
pointed uiiuer u.
Hy reason of the very nature of the
act. Administration men are convinc
ed, efforts tn enjoin Its operation will
fall.
May Knjoin Interference.
On tho other hand. It Is thought. It
may bo possible to enjoin "Interfer
ence" by the railroads with Interstate
, traffic, ns labor leaders wero enjoined
In tho famous Pullman strike of
twenty jeur ngo.
Work of fm initiating the govern
ment's cnuiso of action proceeded rap
Idly today under direction of Assistant
i Attorney General K M. t'nderwnod and
Attorney
Solictor
General John Davis, assisted
by Frank Hagcrmnn. of Kansas rity.
It appeared lll.fiy tho Government
wouid file a demurrer, claiming the
Adamson law constitutional. In answer
to tho railroads' plea for an Injunction
restraining Its enforcement This would
result In a straightaway fight on tho
constitutionality of the net. and would
servo more quickly tn bring tho oaso
boforo the Supremo Court.
