Disgusted Author.
There sometimes seems reason for n
,‘oinplalnt eomiiion among writers of
this day that artists do not read the
text they are to illustrate. In one of
the leading magazines recently tr*
writer mentioned the fact that he*
heroine was entirely hnld —a circum
stance, indeed, that might have been
deduced from the fact that she was
nearly one hundred years old.
Picture the author’s disgust when
tin* old woman was represented with
a head of hair that might have served
for the advertisement of some wonder
ful “restorative!”
Even worse seems the fate of an un
happy writer who wrote a story about
a boy named “Patsy.” The artist met
amorphosed him into a girl.

Chapel In the Trenches.
In one of the French trenches the
men have constructed a small chapel
underneath the earth. It Is sufficient
ly large to admit 20 men at the same
time. Every effort has been made by
the clever workmen who have built It,
skilled minors from the district of La
Loire, to make the underground chapel
difficult of bombardment. The inte
rior ornamentation has been carried
to high perfection, for a parquet floor,
carpets, candlesticks, kneeling chairs
saved from the ruined churches are to
he found In it. A wooden altar has
been erected In the trench chapel, and
u magnificent French flag, the gift of
an officer, has been hung in It.

That the European battle fronts
and the Mexican frontier have nothing

BRITISH-FRENCH
RIVALRY BRINGS
MUTUAL RESPECT
Two Commanders Go Over Para
pets Side by Side in Somme
Battle.
STORY REPEATED MANYTIMES
Old and Recent Arrivals From Great
Britain Look Equally Like Vet*
erans Today—Generous in
Praise of Each Other Are
British and French.
British Front on the Somme. —When
the big push of the Somme was about
to hemu and the French and British
armies were on the keen edge of ex
pectatlun the battalion commander on
the extreme right of the British forces
sent word to the battalion commander
on the extreme left of the French
forces and asked him where he would
he' in the attack, writes Arno Dosch-
Fleurot in the New York World.
“I shall be over the parapets with
tlie first wave of my troops,” was the
French commander’s reply.
‘‘So shall I,” was the British com
mander's return message; “keep an
eye out for me.”
So, when the troops were Jammed
in the forward trenches waiting for
the enormous mine explosions under
the Herman communication trenches,
which were to he the signal for the
assault, the {Srttish commander worked
his way to the end of tin* furthest
trench and there he found the French
commander. They stood there wait
ing. side by side, until the terrific ex
plosions tore the Herman trenches to
pieces, then, one with an “Eu Avaiit”
and tlie other with “Charge!” leaped
over Hie parapets, automatics in hand,
and led the charge into tlie German
lines.
Luckily, both escaped unhurt, and
the story of their unusual action lias
run through the two great allied armies
on the Somme. It has gone complete
ly through the British array, in fact,
and I first heard it long before I
reached the Somme. I heard it so often
that I mu not sure where I heard It
first, hut I remember being told it at
tlie table of the divisional command
er just south of Ypres, nearly a hun
dred miles from the Somme.
Mutual Good Will.
As I kept on hearing this_ story I
began to feel it was a little too put to
be true, hut it also struck me that
it did not make much difference
whether it was or not. Since 1 have
readied the Somme 1 have hud it con
firmed, hut whether it was true or not
was nowhere nearly so important us
the effect it had upon tlie troops. It
thrilled tlie allied armies, and gave
them a dramatic example of their
brotherhood in arms. Certainly, from
the point of view,of the British army
it has done much toward making them
feel good toward tlie Frenchman fight
ing beside them.
Tliis inis Interested me, as the re
lations between the Frencli and the
British armies has always interested
me. I know from my own experience
with the first British troops that came
to France that they had tlie typical in
sular attitude of superiority, except in
the case of individuals who had seen
the French in action and knew at first
hand what good soldiers they were.
After two years every hit of that is
gone. Going about tlie British front,
ns I have just been doing, I have been
struck, in fact, by tlie way everyone
lias made a point of calling attention
to the work of tlie French troops. At
most points along tlie 100-kilometer
front the British now hold there were
formerly French troops, and tlie Brit
ish troops who now occupy these
trenches have dally object lessons in
what good soldiers Hie Frencli must
be to do some of the things that are
everywhere apparent.
Death Toll at Vimy Ridge.
I had a striking example of tills the
other day when I arrived on the Brit
ish front. The first place where I ap
proached tlie firing line was at the
Vimy Uldge, north of Arras, a piece
of France that has been fought over
no less fiercely than the Mort Homme
or Les Eparges. Tlie fight begun at
Notre Dame de Lorette, which fig
ured in tlie French communiques al
most dally for months, and us the
Germans were pushed out of there by
the French pollus they left behind the
wreck of Ahlaln-St. Nazalre and
Souchez before they were forced to
the height of Vimy Ridge, which they
still hold. The little valley in between
is soaked with blood. At Notre Dame
de Lorette, on u space not over a mile
long and 300 yards wide, at least 50,-
000 men gave up their lives. It is im
possible to walk there now without
constantly stumbling over hoots with
in which the dry bones rattle in a
very ghostly manner.
All this magnificent . fighting was
done by French soldiers, and yet it
was the first place to which the Brit
ish brought me. They have bloody
battlefields of their own to show—
Ypres, Loos and Neuve Chapelle—
but the place they chose showed only
what the French had done. It is true
that over on the Vimy Ridge there is
a daily battle going on that would he
considered Important in any other
war, hut Is never even mentioned in
the British communiques. While I
was there the trench mortars on both
sides were busy and doing harm, too, (
lint no ground was being gained or
lost.
Generous Praise.
Even before we reached' the front
tlie divisional artillery commander,
whom wo called on ns we were en
tering ids division, told us to take
particular note of the excellent
Frencli artillery fire, which we would
he able to see ns we advanced over
Hie ground Hie French had conquered.
(Two paragraphs here expunged by
Hie censor.)
Here on the Somme is seen the other
side. Small parties of French soldiers
frequently pass along the British line,
looking over Hie ground they have
gained and with practiced eye, noting
the address and courage it took to
make these galas. They do not say
much, these visiting French soldiers,
largely because they cannot talk with
Hie average British soldier and the
average British soldier cannot talk
with them, hut they look one another
over us they go by and tlie visiting
parties confer together, visualizing
Hie course of the various attacks by
the trenches and mine craters, and
evidently returning to their camps
to tell about it.
I asked a party going through hero
today what they thought of the Brit
ish advance. One of them, a non-com
missioned officer, pointed to the com
plicated series of trenches Hie Brit
ish had taken, and to the British
front line Itself, seven or eight miles
away over Hie captured Herman
trenches, and said: "They could not |
do more if It were their own country ;
they were reclaiming from the in
vader.”
Up in tills part of France one sees
very little of the French army now
adays, except for occasional artillery
officers and territorial reglraenft
working on the roads. They are keep
ing the roads in excellent repair, too.
All tlie front from here to the other
side of Ypres Is British, and It Is all
active, even If one does nut hear much
except from the Somme.
There was a time, when trench
warfare wiis new, when regiments
remained opposite each other for
mouths without serious losses, but
that Is not true any more. The de
velopment of trench bombs and |
trench mortars has made tlie mere
holding of trenches a costly business, j
At a number of points along tlie line
where I have toadied, the opposing
armies were forever blowing each oili
er out. All day they knocked down !
each other’s defenses and all night
they built them up again— ti tedious j
business, and costly in lives as well.
On the Vimy Ridge, which I have j
already mentioned, the Hermans hold
the crest and the British are imme
diately under them, never giving them
a moment's rest. The daily casualties
on both sides must he considerable,
and, ns the English seem to be the
most active, tlie Germans must carry
away many dead mid wounded men
every night from that one point—and
that Is a sector not now spoken of as
active.
“The Pimple.”
Right on the ridge is a slight rise
called by tlie English Tommies “The
Pimple,” Hie occasion for that name
not being very elegant. It Is so called,
because, though tlie British mortars
knock It level every day, it rises again
every night.
It was particularly interesting to
me to visit Notre Dame de Lorette.
I visited that section eighteen months
ago with the French army when the
Hermans still held the whole district.
Then I had been aide only to peep
out through Hie trees above at the
Herman trenches. Now I could walk
anywhere T liked, with the one danger
that the Germans might try shell fire
at me. As they have the range of
every square yard, they might have
tried for the small party of which I
was one, but It was not likely.
There Hie depression of war was
heavier than anywhere I have ever
encountered It. The serried hillsides
have grown rankly to weeds, well
nourished by the many thousands of
dead who lie there. It was a place |
of combat which is to be reckoned
with Verdun and the Somme, but the
hundreds of connecting trenches are
beginning to fall In, and this sea
son Hie long weeds bide most of them.
In the space which lies at every front
between the trenches and the artil
lery which stands guard over them
there is a silence that makes itself
felt even In the midst of the constant
bombing a mile or so away. The
only life Is shown hy thousands of
little birds which rise restlessly and
keep dropping hack to get the rich
seeds from the well fertilized weeds.
Bewildered Birds.
There are birds also here on the
Somme, whole flights of thorn, no big
ger than swallows. I was watching
some today under shellfire. They rise
and drop in a bewildered way but do
not seem to know what to do or where
to go. If there is half a minute be
tween shells they turn at once to pick
ing up seeds.
In writing about the Somme I find
it is the ourlous details 111& this that
hold one’s Interest at the time. The
tremendous drama is always there on
a scale one can hardly conceive. There
is that terrific give and take of shells
accompanied hy a superhuman cool
ness of design. The moments when
you don’t see destruction right about
you It hangs Imminent in the air and
keeps you constantly reminded by the
shriek of the passing shells and the
violent shiver of their arrival. An arc
of bursting shells with tlie quick rise
of smoke and the rays of the explosion
forms a curtain before the enemy, and
If you tire ot that you can always look
up and watch tlie British aeroplanes
daring the German antiaircraft guns
and changing their course every min-
ute to avoid the {lufTltalls of shrapnel
that appear In bunches at the spot
where they have just left. In the
hardy way one has of talking at the
front you hear It constantly spoken
of as a “show” —and It is all that,
Nothing that could touch It was ever
staged.
The Somme Battlefield.
The appearance of the battlefield Is
most remarkable. I have already
cabled a description In which I com
pared it to a cubist painting; nor
did that description strain the effect.
Just us a picture It Is in Itself a
strained effect. In away it reminds
one of some of the drawings made
of the battlefields of the American
Civil war, In which the artist tried
to show the mass of men on the bat
tlefield, but in the mass they are not
like ordinary men. They appear In
their very massing to have created
something new.
Beside me Is James 11. Hare, the
war photographer, suffering for lack
of the camera which he was forbid
den In this most Intenselyxlnterestlng
spot a photographer could hope to
find. But, great photographer us he
Is, I doubt that his Instrument could
record that peculiar modern effect of
the battlefield of the Somme.
At this stage of the war the morale
of the men holds one's Interest as
much as the fight they are making.
All about Is this new British army,
men who had only vague notions of
war two years ago and, until this
• war broke out, never expected to have
| a hand In one. Yet here they are as
I soldierly a lot as you will find In any
army. They look like old soldiers
and, In the Intensive forcing of new
troops this war has caused, they are
veterans.
The Australians and Canadians one
j hears the most about, and, as I saw
I the Australians and New Zealanders
last winter in Egypt just as they came
1 back bored with Gallipoli and eager
to get at the Germans, I expected to
write In particular about them. But
now I am here all the troops are so
soldierly It would he unfair to dis
tinguish. It Is wonderful what has
been done with some of the regiments
of the most insular ami narrow of
British workmen from the Midlands,
I coal miners and plow boys. I cannot
| tell the regiments of Kent from those
j of Ulster.
Ulster arid Dublin.
War as a leveler, however, has had
Its supreme test here. Some of the
i Ulster regiments here found them
j selves short of officers, I have been
j told, and it was necessary to supply
j them with officers from the south of
I Ireland. There was no objection
raised either, and the combination has
worked wonderfully well. Surely there
could he no greater proof of the dead
seriousness of this business than the
willingness of Ulster and Dublin men
to fight and die together; and when It
comes to Ulster men permitting them
selves to be led by those from Dublin,
the story of the Drench and British
commanders who went over the para
pets together Is us nothing for dra
matic force.
SWAMPED BY FOREIGN GOLD

United States sub-treasury in New
York city. More than $000,000,0' it) In
gold bars have passed through the pro
cesses of this ollice and now the office
Is being kept busy both day and night.
In the case of foreign shipments,
most of which come from France and
England consigned to J. P. Morgan and
Company, the fiscal agents of the allies
In this country, the gold, In huge bars,
worth approximately $8,500 each, are
shipped by express. The bars are un

office, a sample assay Is taken and
then the rest of the gold melted down,
refined and recast into large bars
again.
Besides this foreign gold the assay
office refines old gold and silver for
jewelers. This business Is quite large
at the present time. Mr. Vernle M.

i| A DIFFICULT MISSION
By NAPOLEON 8. ZARICK.
Both Rowley and Hart have long
honored me with their confidences.
Even when we were chums at school 1
was the repository of their secrets, the
mediator In their quarrels.
It was one day when I sat by my
studio window that Rowley and Hart
arrived together at my door. They sat
down. Rowley looked at Hurt. Hart
returned the compliment. Silence en
sued.
“Boys,” said I, at length, “you had
better toss up for who speaks first."
They grinned uneasily and then Row
ley, who Is, perhaps, Just a thought
quicker than Hart, opened the conver
sation.
"Jack,” he began, “you know Miss
Annie Seymour?”
I nodded affirmatively.
“Well,” he continued, "it's about her.
You see, we’re both very much In love
with her."
“And she?" I asked.
Hart took up the thread. “She has
been nice—very nice to both of us,” he
said. "In fact, Jack, we cannot decide
which of us she prefers. And we don't
want to take any unfair advantage.”
“But —” 1 begun.
“You don't see what we're driving at,
eh? Well, I’ll explain, If Hart will al
low me. We Just want you to be the
same kind old Jaek you've always
been. We want you U) —to —well, dash
It all —we want you to find out for us
which of the two she really does want
to marry."
1 sat up, and lit a cigar.
"You see, boys,” said I, “there's a
little difficulty In the way which you
don't seem to have considered. Miss
Annie Seymour barely knows me.”
“Oh, but she does, and likes you,
too!” This from Hart.
“Boys,” said I, “It’s a ticklish mis
sion, but I promise you I’ll do my
best.”
-•• • • • •
“Dear me, Mr. Wlnton! Ton have
been an unjustifiable time about cull
ing.”
“My dear Miss Seymour, one cannot
set lightly about Important functions.”
“You cull on the muses daily, I am
told.”
“But they are never at home, I as
sure you.”
“I wish I were a muse,” remarked
Miss Seymour, with an adorable smile.
“But you are," I protested. "You
certainly are —the tenth muse. The
muse of —”
"Of afternoon ton, of course. Wou't
you have some tea, Mr. Wlnton?”
“By the way,” was my first shot, "I
saw John Hart yesterday.”
“Indeed? Sugar, Mr. Wlnton?"
“And Bob Rowley, too. Saw them
both together."
“Really! Cream, Mr. Wlnton?”
Both of my shots had failed! For a
young woman supposed to be deeply
Interested in two young men, Miss Sey
mour’s matter-of-fact reception of
those young men's names seemed sin
gular Indeed.
It were useless to detail our conver
sation. Sulllco it that, although I re
turned again and again to the charge,
I failed to arouse In Miss Seymour the
slightest evidence of interest either In
Hart or Rowley.
And the odd part of It was that she
changed the subject from my friends’
affairs to mine—displaying, Indeed, a
fluttering, if unaccountable Interest lq
all my humble doings. In the end, I
became desperate. Daring tactics, I
felt, were the only means at hand.
"Miss Seymour,” I said, “you do not
seem to be enthusiastic over either
Boh Rowley or Jack Hart.”
Up wont Miss Seymour’s eyebrows.
“Well, hardly!" she exclaimed. "I
don’t see why I should be.”
“Now suppose—just suppose—that
one of them were to full hopelessly la
love with a certain Miss Seymour,
would there be any hope for him?”
Miss Seymour set down her tea cup
and looked at me sternly—that Is to
say, as severely as she could. “Mr.
Wlnton,” she remarked, “you were
asked to come here and put that ques
tion to me!”
“No,” I said, "not that one—l have
overstepped my mission.”
I began studying the shape of ray
boots, and wondering which was the
foot I had Just “put Into It."
Then there was a little final chut
us I took my leave. I don’t quite
know how It came to pass, but just
before I departed Miss Seymour asked
mo, “You don't read your Longfellow,
do you Mr. Wlnton?”
“Well —no,” I replied; “not Shakes
periully, as one might say.”
"There is some really excellent com
mon sense in Longfellow, Qood-by, Mr.
Wlnton."
About half .way down the street I
stopped suddenly.
“Longfellow!” 1 remarked to myself.
“Longfellow? Now what has Long
fellow got to do with my little
schemes? She Is not a young woman
who makes remarks without reason or
connection. And then her look when
she said —! I'll swear there is some
consoling message for poor Bob ud
John concealed between the covers of
Longfellow?”
And then, all of a sudden, a pre
sumptuous thought set my mind
nwhirl.
I hastened home and took down a
copy of Longfellow’s poems from my
library shelf. As fate would have it,
I opened the volume ut the line, "Why
don't you speak for yourself, John?”
