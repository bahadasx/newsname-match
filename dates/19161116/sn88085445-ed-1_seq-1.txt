Vol. IX
WEST PUTS WILSON
BACK IN OFFICE
New York.—The tension of the
most dramatic situation in the polltt
:al history of the United States was
broken when California swung defin
itely into the democratic column fol
lowed by New Mexico, New Hamp
»hire and North Dakota, thus insur
ing the re-election of President Wil
son and Vice-President Marshall. The
result in Minnesota, the other doubt
ful state, indicated a \ct\ small ma
jority for Hughes. The controlling
factor in Minnesota was the vote of
the 2138 National guardsmen now on
the Mexican border, and the official
:ount by the slate canvassing board
will be necessary to definitely deter
mine the result.
In round figures, unofficial returns
show Wilson a lead in California about
1000; in New Mexico, about 2300; in
Dakota, about 1500; in Minne
sota, Hughes' lead about 200. while in
New Hampshire there is a margin of
53 for Wilson.
West and South Elect Wilson.
Mr. Wilson is the only president
ever elected with the "solid east'
against him. His victory was believed
by politicians to presage an alignment
for the first time in congress of the
west with the south. It was pointed
out that while he would not have "a
working majority in the lower house,
he would not have to combat a major
ity inimical to his policies."
For the first time since Andrew
Jackson, a democratic president has
been re elected in succession to him
3elf. For the first time a president
has been elected without the vote ol
New York. For the first time Maine
went republican in September and the
sountry democratic in November.
Wilson's After-Election Smile.
Jackson won the presidency by a
combination of the south and the new
west. Wilson has been re-elected by
a combination of the solid south. Ohio
and the newer far west.
Party Lines Apparently Shattered
Party lines were bent and shattered
by the complicated issues of the cam
paign. hut mostly in favor of the dem
oerats. The president received much
support from progressives, yet he also
carried that citadel of the republi
cans. Ttah. one of the two states won
by Tart in Ult
In 1912 Wilson was elected with
1.30 U.MS fewer votes than the repub
Mean and progressive poll combined
In 1916 he was elected with 400,000
more votes than the republicans and
reaftiliated progressives. Bryan, in
1896. polled a larger popular vote than
any democratic candidate for the pres
idency in the history of the country
until Wilson, in 1916. exceeded that
high water mark by more than 2,000,-
--000.
Women voters in 12 states took
part in the presidential election. Ten
of these states were carried by Presi
dent Wilson and two by Charles E.
Hughes. Washington. California. Ari
zona. Idaho. Montana. I'tah. Colorado,
Wyoming, Kansas and Nevada are the
equal suffrage states which gave their
electoral vote to President Wilson,
while Oregon and Illinois are the two
states which went for Hughes.

DAIRYMEN MAY BUY
ALFALFA ACREAGE
To discuss the purchase of alfal-
Ita Taiid East of the mountains, ;o
jgetber with ot'.er problems of the
'farmer, the Whatcom County D l y
j man's Association will meet In Lyn
j don Saturday. Sessions will be
•h« Id nt Jamiesnn's Hall, and all
'dairymen are urged In attend.
The following oi'tMne of tie r'-
! fj'lfa plan haß been prepared by A.
Lf. Clode:
"How to obviate a repetition of
II | shortage in this county hps bee'i
discussed pro and con, but no defi
nite plan was reached until the
, Whatcom County Da'ry assnciat'on
j held i's monthly meeting at Acme
on the fourth Saturday in October.
;Tien the secretary, Mr. J. P. Snrth,
of Laurel, sprang a pan whe'ely
'the farmers co'Ud grow tl eir "wn
I alfalfa at a cost, laid down in What
| com county of from $8 to Jlo per
; ton.
| "It appears that Mr. S'nith fnd
' Mr. Douglas, who owns a neat little
''trd of thoroughbred Guernsey cows
at Ferndale pot wind of a tract of
j 400 acres of land that is for aa'e in
; the Yakima country. This land was
'reported as good alfalfa land; and
jto make sure they were not being
;tcld a fish' story, both Mr. Douglas
and Mr. Smith took a trip to Tak-
I ima for t' c especial p irpose of In
j vestigating. Mr. S'r.lth RO&fOSMd
that went a pessimist, but .-ane
; hack an optimist. He told the
dairymen at Acme thi-t Ihe land
was a sort of volcanic ash which
1 -reduced not only four crops of al
falfa, but the best corn he hod rtet
seen was grown in the neighborhood
of O'e 400 acres that is for sale.
"Not far away from this tract
the dairymen of Snohomish county
have purchased C 25 acres, all of
whdi they propose to have in al
falfa early next spring. M. W. H.
Tierney, president of the Snohomish
Dairy association, was at the Acme
meeting and stated that the farm
ers in his county had formed ; hem
selves into a corporation and had
purchased this land for the express
P'trpose of growing their own al
falfa and strongly recommended Ihe
dairymen of Whatcom county to do
likewise and buy the 400 acres
wh'le they lad the opportunity.
"Naturally the farmers did not
swallow the proposition then and
•here, but appointed a committee of
six to investigate. This committee
•atH at the Leopold hotel, Belling
liiu, on the evening of the 2nd in
stant, and threshed the subject out
uioil nearly midnight. It was fin
ally resolved to bring the matter
before the Dairy association at Lyn
den on Saturday, and in order tf
a\e some definite plan to lay be
fore the people, Mr. O. P. Brown,
one of the committee, was instruct
sd to have articles of incorporation
read* so that if ihe farmers deed(
to purchase this land prompt art iota
can be taken as the owners l.aye
only allowed a thirty days opion
"So now, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer,
if you feel at all interested >n the
pioposiiion of growing your own al
falfa hay, be stwe aud attend .hat
meeting. All the details will bt
explained to you far better than 1
can do in the limited space of thifc
article, but 1 may mention that i.
the land is purchased the purchas
ers will not have anything to pay
t ■ first year excepting the amount
c essay to put the soil under cul
i vat ion and ten years will be al
t-wed in which to pay for the land.
"A large number of Snohomish
farmers merely took four acres
each. It is estimated that four
Ss es will produce at least two
carloads of hay which can be lawi
.'.own in Whatcom county at froii
$8 to $10 per ton."
