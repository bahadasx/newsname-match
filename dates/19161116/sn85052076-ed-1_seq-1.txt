Forest
The danger is past for the present because of the rain,
but we have been throngh a time of great peril.
The ground has been covered with dry leaves and
grass, and every stump in the forest a pile of kindling
wood. Some fences and houses have been burned, and
thousands of dollars worth of fertility on' the ground
reduced to ashes. ..
Why will folks be so careless?
And why will they not help each other?
Berea College spent a large amount of money fight
ing fire for its neighbors, and is rewarded by having its
own properties almost wholly saved.
Forest fires are something everybody in Eastern
Kentucky must reckon with. Let us be ready.
Hurrah for Woodrow Wilson!
Again the schoolmaster is made President.
Woodrow Wilson -was not the man the Democrats
desired to put in office, but he was the man they felt
most hope of electing, and in he goes!
Wilson himself has been forced to do some bad things
in order to get a chance to do some bigger good things.
Andyhe has had to use seme poor tools in his work. But
on the whole he has done so much more good than harm,
and has shown so great ability, and so great a desire to
"promote the general welfare'1 that all Americans can
give him a hearty cheer. Let us expect that his second
term will be even better than his first.
APPROPRIATE TOR THANKS
GIVING Monday, November B. a delegation
representing a large number of
War Relief Organizations waited up
on President Wilson at Shadow
Lawn and presented the following
memorial :
To the President of the United
Slates. Executive Offlres, Asbury
Park, New Jersey.
Sir:
Your petitioners, representing
various organization and move
incuts engaged in the relief of suf-
fering in the area of the war, pro
foundly believe that every possible
persuasion should be brought to
bear and every opportunity pre
sented, whereby our people shall
respond to this appalling need.
The gifts of the American people,
while generoim and constant, are
, Ntill incommensurate to nicer, the
demand of our breUiern in dis
tress, which are rontantly increas
ing, and, it should be frankly ad
mitted, are as yet by no means pro
portional In our resources and are
not an adequate exirciin of na
tional unselfishness.
We. therefore, suggest tliat in
vftiir annual Thanksgiving Procla
mation, as yon remind the peopfo to
(five Ihnnks for our properily and
pence, you invite them, at their rc
spective assemblies on or near
Thanksgiving Day, or in their home
circles, to remember with sympa
thy and love the peoples of the oth
er nations so grievously afflicted,
and suggest that they make this an-
other occasion to render their gifts
as an appropriate expression of
their thanks to Almighty Hod. the
father of all, for another year of
national well-being.
The memorial was presented by
Rev. Charles 8. Macfarland, General
- Secretary of the Federal Council of
the Churches of Christ in America,
, and the delegates included Brerk
Trowbridge, Chairman of the Serbi
an Relief Committee of America; fl.
V. Giddings, Secretary of the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium; 8am

CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK
Managers and Brotherhood Disagree
Upon Application of the Adamson
Law MMtaga System and Compen
sation Stumbling Block.
New York, Not. 14. Danger or a
nation-wide railroad -strike, which
waa belieTed to have been averted by
the passage ot the Adamson eight
hour law, has not entirely disap
peared, It developed here when rep
resentatives of the railroads and the
four brotherhoods, comprising 400,
000 employee, failed to reach an
agreement as to the proper applica
tion of the new law. The stumbling
block, both sides admitted, was the
existing mileage system of compen
sation. The announcement of the latest
deadlock between the railroads and
their employes came at the conclusion
of an all-day conference between the
national conference committee of the
railways and the brotherhood chiefs,
which had been arranged In Sep
tember. "We met." said Eltsha Le. chair
man of the railroad managers and of
the conference, "for the purpose of
exchanging Ideas on the application
and operation of the Adamson law.
We failed to reach an agreement and
we are not certara that another meet
ing will take place.1
William O. Lee. president of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen,
apoke for the employes In the absence
of A. B. Garretson of the Order of
Railway Conductors, declared that in
the event of evasion by the railroads
of the Adamsoa law aummary action
would be taken by the brotherhood..
He said that the strike order, which
was directly responsible for the law,
waa still In effect and the brother
hoods would not hesitate to enforce It
If the occasion warranted It
"The brotherhoods asked for the
-conference." said Mr. Lee. "At the
morning session we discussed the ap-
plication of the law and found that
there was no basis upon which we
could possibly agree. Another set
back, besides the elimination of the
mileage system, was the determina
tion of the railroads to continue their
suits to determine the constitutional
ity of the law."
The- mileage system of compensa
tion, the basis of which is the num
ber of miles traversed by a train crew
and not the actual hours of work. Is
the crux of the new problem that a
railroad authority said, may result in
the development of a situation simi
lar to the one which brought Into be
ing the Adamson law.
"Frankly." said Chairman Lee of
the conference committee. In discuss
ing this phsse of the situation, "the
trouble lies In the fact that neither
the railroads nor the men know defi
nitely how the law should be applied.
"We have our own ideaa as to how
the law shall be applied If at all, as
suits to test Its validity are now pend
ing: while the brotherhoods have
their own ideas."
Chairman Lee added that he could
not predict the probable outcome of
the difficulty. He said, however, that
negotiations might be resumed by
calling another conference.
Besides William O. Lee, the broth
erhood chiefs at the conference were
Warren 8. Stone of the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers; W. S. Car
ter, Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire
men and Enptnemen, and E. U Shep

WORLD HEWS
Hard fighting has been going on
both on the eastern and the western
frontiers of the war, owing to the
better weather. The Knglish and
French have gained along a frontage
of a thousand yards in the Somme
region and the Russians have repuls
ed a severe attack of the Germans
and Austrian near Lemberg, in
Cialiria.
The German Chanrelnr in a Speech
to the Reichstag has sounded a
distant note of peace. He said that
Germany would be willing, under
some conditions, to take part in a
conference which would have for
its purpose the establishment of a
league of Peace to prevent war in
the future. It is only on such terms
that peace can be had, as militarism
must be suppressed before the allies
will think of peace.
Poland has been given indepen
dence, or at least nominal indepen
dence, by Germany in return for her
assistance in the war. The Poles by
this realize their great ambition
but likewise assume a great burden.
Germany has been quick in de
manding the price of her set and
armies are now being raised. Pol
and bas been duly attentive in her
expressions of gratitude to Germany.
The American elections of the
week have created great interest in
Europe. They have been taken pre
cedence to war news on the front
page of the newspapers, and on
bulletins. The result has been re
ceived with general satisfaction and
European countries consider it a
vindication of the policy of neu
trality, on the part of the United
States. Europe seems as favorabtf
to that course as the United States
herself.
Canada has just installed her new
Governor-General, the Duke of Dev
onshire, at the capital, Ottawa. This
officer is the King's representative
in 'Canada and the executive head
of the -country. In Canada, as in
England, however, the real execu
tive s the Prime Minister, chosen
from the ruling party in the Parlia
ment, rrhje Dukes of Devonshire
have been strong men, noted for
their interest in policies of better
ment. The kingdom of Arabia has just
come into being as a new member
of the sisterhood of nations. By the
aid of the English, the liberty lov
ing Arab people have thrown off the
yoke of Turkey, under which they
have been so long. The capital of
the country is the famous old Mo
hammedan city, Meca, and their
first king is Hussein Ben Ali. They

Submarines have been especially
active during the past week. Among
the large number of vessels torpe-dis-d
was the Columbian, a United
Slates boat, which was aunk off the
cuasl of Spain. The vessel carried
no passengers and most of the crew
