BiEicss cl F!c:jy, Is the
New. Orgixz&tisa
New York, Nor. It. Prospects of
th greatest Industrial struggle In
ttlatory were Increasing today. The
capital and labor tltuaUnn arising
from the rallroada' determination to
fight the Adamaon tight-hour law wii
accentuated by tormatlon of a t
organisation of employers, to be
tnown at the National Industrial
Conference board. Thin new body,
representing f 1,000,000,000 capital
and employing 7,000.000 persons,
propose that Industrial legislation
hall be watched more oloaety, that
legislator shall be guided by public
Information and that favoritism to
labor thall ba eliminated.
It will fight auoh meaaurei aa the
Adamaon eight-hour law: and It be
lieves that the election thowed there
la labor vote, and hence legisla
tor! hereafter need not curry favor
with labor leaders, which It claims
ha been done In the past.
The significance of the tw align
ment Increased wlth receipt of word
In United Press Baltimore dispatches
that the brotherhoods will join to
force the eight-hour day In all In
dustrie not by legislation, but by
the force of organised labor.
The rallroada kept up their pre
parations for trying to prevent oper
ation of the Adamaon law. More suits,
covering all lines and all districts,
will be submitted to court all over
the nation In the next ten days.
It was apparent In railroad circles
today that the manager have vir
tually given ui hope of coming to
terma with the brotherhood chiefs,
although they said "The latch string
Is out for the men and their repre
sentatives," .The managers' confer
ence ha adjourned. 'Another meet
ing may be ealleM neat week, how
ever. It waa aatd today.
On of the leading railroad man
ager aald today he known nothing
about a reported conference with the
president.
Baltimore, Nov. II. New from
New York that capital bad formed

American Federation of Labor con
vention here today, . President Oomp
ers said he would discuss tho new
capitalist move before the convention
the Brat of nett week, when the rail

"It would be unwise tor ma to

Instructed his secretaries to obtain
further Information about the new
board.
Frank Morrison, national secre
tary, ald:
"This movement will result as oth
ers have don before. When the
' National , Association of Manufac
turers was formed It added thousand
to the rank of organised labor.".
There was much animated discus
sion today of th coming visit of th

IKE HARD FIGHT -FOR
LAW
Washington, Nov. 16. The admin
istration Is ready to start an aggres
sive right In behalf of the Adamaon
eight-hour law, now object of con
certed attack by most-of the big rail
roads of the rotintry, It was made
clear tods)'. -
Heller waa expreased by high offi
clala that the efforts to enjoin the
operation of the law would fall.
It was suggested that the govern
ment might not confine its effort to
defensive tactics, if the hope of the"
railroads to prevent the operation of
the law should appear likely of reali
sation. If the railroads tie up the enforce
ment of the Adamaon act, the rail
road workers are expected to atrlke.
It is the view of some of the presi
dent's advisers that the court would
hold the railroad responsible for the
Interference with Interstate commerce
In such cases and would compel them
to abide by' the provision of the act.
Thta belief I strengthened by the
administration' claim that the Adam
ton law primarily 1 a measure de
signed to obtain a' thorough ' and
scientific investigation of facts oh
which to bate final legislation. It la
to be In effect only sis month, duct
ing th time of Investigation of th
application of the eight-hour day. It
can be extended only thirty day at
th request of the special commission
appointed under It.
By reason of the very nature of the
ad, administration men are con
vinced effort to enjoin ita operation
Will fall.
' On the other hand, It I thought,
It may be possible to enjoin "Inter
ference" by the railroads with Inter
state traffic, aa labor leader were
enlolned In th famous Pullman
strike of twenty year ago.
Work of formulating the govern
ment' course of., action proceeded
rapidly today under direction of Ae
sistant Attorney General K. M. I'n
tlcrwood and Solicitor General John
Davis.' It appeared likely the govern
ment would file a demurrer, claiming
the Adamaon law constitutional, In
answer to the railroad' (ilea for an
Injunction . restraining It enforce
ment. This would result la a straight
away fight o tht: coastltttthmallt;

London, Not. 16. -England I a
j ,,nlt today In the upport of th gov-
eminent' food dictatorship plan
Not a newspaper or an Individual ap
parently In the whole United King
dom voiced criticism of the plan an
nounced In parliament yesterday by
Walter Runciman contemplating con
servation of ' Kngland'a food supply.
The only criticisms heard were that
the government control had been
overlong delayed, and the prelimin
ary plans as announced were Insuf
ficiently sweeping or drastic
It la known, however, that Runcl
man' announcement waa purely pre
liminary and that he did not reveal
all th steps of control which th
government ha determined upon.
The food dictatorship, It waa aald,
may eventually outdo even the thor-
oughne of th German system.
Th British people are fully pre
pared for the sacrifices wblcb It Is
realised will be consequent upon the
adoption of the new plan In a few
days, " "
It waa accented here that the first
activities of the new "dictatorship
would have to do with limitation of
the use of sugar in costly confection
ery. of Indiscriminate feeding to ant
mala of vegetable suitable tor hu
man consumption and of wasteful
use of white flour and potatoes.
Retail food prices, according to
semi-official statistics available to
day, show that In a year there has
been an Increase of about 17 per
cent. Prices are now about 78 per
cent higher than they war prior to
the war. ' But on such staples as
eggs, potatoes, fish and ' sugar ' th
prices bave nearly doubled. "
