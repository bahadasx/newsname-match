the heavenly life in the quietness

her 85th year.
All her life was spent in Penn

also twelve grand children and
four great grandchildren,' among
the number bereaved by her
death.
A good many years ago she

Jesus Christ as her personal
Saviour andjn faith in Him and
in the expectation of eternal life

herself with the Methodist Epis
copal Church in Shelby in 1909
and remained in that fellowship

letter that on October 16th, he
sailed from Newport News, Va.,
on the . steamship Baron Pols
worth, carrying 1,000 tons of coal,
2,500 bales of cotton and 1,000
fine mules. During the voyage
they encountered two fierce
storms. Their propeller blade
was broken in mid-ocean, neces
sitating repairs. They met no
sub-marines, but two ships that
sailed two days later from the
same Dortwere tornedned. There
were sixty men aboard Bob's ves
sel. He said that if he ever
reached the good oldUnited States
again, he would not cro on a sim

Wells Tannery, Monday morning,
November 12, 1916, aged about
seventy years. The funeral con
ducted by her pastor, Rev. Dr,
Dalling, of the Presbyterian
church.took place Wednesday and
her remains were laid to rest in
the old Presbyterian graveyard
in the Valley, beside those of her
parents and some of her brothers
and sisters.
Miss Kate was a daughter of
John and Rachel Wishart and be
longed to one'of Wells Valley's
oldest and most highly esteemed
families. Of the ten children
born to John and Rachel Wishart,
but one now remains Mrs. Su
san Horton, Elkins, W. Va.
Miss Wishart, early in life, gave
her heart to God, and it can be
truthfully said of her, as it was
said of Dorcas of olden time, "she
was full of good works and alms-
deeds which she did." She had
the most solicitous interest in the
welfare of everyone within the
circle of her acquaintance, and
she will live in the memory of a
multitude of friends.
Mrs. Benjamin F. Wible.
Mrs. Matilda Heck Wible. wife
of Benjamin F. Wible, died at
Kpobsville, this county, Monday
morning, November 13,1916, aged
83 years, 10 months and 4 days.
The funeral, conducted by her
pastor, Rev. Edward Jackson, of
McConnellsburg, took place yes
terday morning, and her remains
were laid to rest in the family
plot in the cemetery at Knobs
ville. Mrs. Wible was born in Hun
tingdon county.' On the 1.9th day
of February, 1856, she was mar
ried at Three Springs to Benjamin
F. Wible, who survives her, to
gether with the following child
ren: Mrs. W. Scott Brant, A. Lin
coln, B. Frank, Lewis H., David,
Harvey and Olin, all of whom re
side in this county, except Lewis,
who is the Statistician in the De
partment of Agriculture, Harris

Huntingdon. There are thirty
four grand children, of which
twenty-nine are living, and thirty-seven
great grand children.
With the passing " away of Mrs.
Wible, the. last member of her
father's family has gone.
At the age of 12 year3, Mrs.
Wible identified herself with the
Methodist church, and for a pe
riod of more than three-score-years-and-ten
s,he was an exem
plary Christian one of those
good old-fashioned Methodists
who are not ashamed of Jesus.
On account of advancing age
she and her husband disposed of
the farm and went to Knobsville,
where they made their home with
their son Frank. Last Sunday
Mrs. Wible in her usual health
attended Class at the church near
by and greatly enjoyed the ser
vices. In the evening she, to
gether with Frank's family, start
ed to go to church to hear a ser
mon by their pastor, Rev. Jack
son. As she was descending the
steps leading from the porch at
their home, she fell, her head
striking the concrete walk. She
was picked up unconscious, re
maining in that condition until 5
o'clock next morning when she
passed away, ,
Eggs Dollar Dozen.
W. T. Wittman, of the State
Agricultural Department, states
that a Jersey Shore Pa., man
has a contract with a New
York family to supply the lat
ter with, twelve dozenstrictly
treih eggs every week from
November 1st to next Apri
1st, at $1.00 per dozen. Other
poultrymen have , similar con
tracts, the price ranging from 62
cents to 67 cents per dozen.
These wealthy families are willing
to pay these prices for the certain
ty of receiving not only new-laid
eggs, but eggs of good flavor,
and that have been kept clean
and wholesome by , proper care
Suppose that dollar-a-dozen fam
ily should drive through -Fulton
county in their auto. Suppose
we met them in the road with
basket of eggs and offered them
at only 50 cents per dozen. They
would laugh at us and drive on
Why? Because how were they to
know that our nice-looking, eggs
did not contain pin-head blood

Dad A Micley Souvenir.
Merchant A. N. Witter, of
Waterfall, besides having shown
ability in the successful manage
ment of his own affairs, has
always manifested an intelligent
interest in public affairs. In the
presidential contest in 1896, Mr,
Witter was a great admirer of
William McKinley and after the
returns were in and the election
of Mr. McKinley was assured,
Mr. Witter wrote Mr. McKinley
a letter or congratulation. A
very few days later the mail
brought to Mr. Witter the follow
ing personal acknowledgement
which Mr. Witter now prizes
very highly:
'Mr. McKinley begs to acknowledge
the receipt of the recent favor of Mr
A. N. Witter, and to return sincere
thanks for his generous congratula
Hods and expressions of good wishes

That Petticoat Fraud.
That petticoat fraud has
reached' Fulton county. Several
weeks ago the News took pains
to warn its readers against ans
wering letters containing an offer
to send a $4.50 petticoat if the
recipient of the letter would write
five letters to friends, and, in ad
dition, send the Minneapolis firm
dime. A lady in this county
informs us that the fraud has
reached Fulton county. We are
sorry. But as each lady lost but
a dime and the postage, and has
learned a lesson, it may result in
shielding them from greater
frauds in the future. Of course,
nobody got a petticoat for ten
cents.

CLEANLINESS VS. PYROMYELITIS.
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LU D.,
Commissioner of Health.
It used to be the custom for
housewives to cleanse their home
twice a year and now advanced
sanitation requires that the home
must be kept clean at all times.
The benefit of cleanliness about
the home reflects both upon the
physical health and the morality
of our people. The necessity of
cleanliness in our homes has be
come so manifest that it is not
worth while to dwell further up
on it.
During therecentbattleagainst
infantile paralysis, we took two
small towns whjch were badly
infected with the disease and had
the homes cleansed, jnsect life
destroyed, food kept clean and no
garbage, ash piles or manure was
allowed to collect. The streets
and alleys were made destn in
each town and infantile paralys
is rapidly disappeared'. The
cleaning up of the municipalities
seems to run parallel with the
subsiding of the disease.
The fact that the disease spreads
at times beyond the bouudary
lines of these dirty breeding
places is no argument against the
theory of cleanliness as a pre
ventive of infantile paralysis.
At present it is well to look upon
filth and insect life as factors
taking a large part in permitting
the so-called plague to invade our
homes.
There has been much said up
on the possibility of an epidemic
next year. This will not nec-
cessarily follow. It might, how
ever, and certainly it will come
back some day.
Cleanliness regarding our chil
dren, homes, stables, yards and
towns as well as guarding our
houses from all kinds of insects
life must be insisted upon by
each individual citizen and by
those in charge of the health and
cleanliness of our towns, coun
try, villages and homes.
"Mixing With Men."
Under the above caption the
Woman's Journal and Suffrage
News" of November 4th, contains
an answer to the question "What
Will Happen if Women Go into
Politics and Mix With Men?"
The writer calls attention to the
fact that these same men and
women meet together many times
a year, and engage in the same
interests, not only in private life,
but in public relations. They
meet on equal footing at fairs,
civic clubs, on school committees,
at church business meetings, they
own stocK in corporations, hold
office in banks, insurance com
panies, and, in addition, he adds
"Women are already allowed, and
encouraged, to take part in all
the public, conspicuous, time-
consuming ana nerve-racKing
part of the campaign to attend
Dublic meetings, write to the
newspapers, argue with the vot
ers, and travel about the country
making public speeches. The
only thing from which they are
debarred is the quiet, modest,
simple, inconspicuous casting of
a vote, which involves about as
much time and 'publicity' as mail
ing a letter at the post office."
Big Car Load.
Sunday of last week, a car load
of Licking Creek township people

Controlling Fire Blight.
"Fire Blight at the present
time is our most destructive dis
ease on apple, pear and quince
trees," says Sheldon W. Funk,
farm adviser of the Pennsylvania
Department of Agriculture. "It
is a bacterial disease and spraying
is of very little practical value,
the only method of control being
to cut out and hew the diseased
branches. Fire Blight works in
a number of different ways on a
tree and is known under several
names. When working on the
branches it is frequently called
Twig Blight, on the blossomc,
Blossom Blight, and when on the
trunk at the base of the tree,
Collar Blight.
"Some varieties are far more
subject to this disease than oth
ers; trees growing too vigorously
are also more liable to attack and
where Fire Blight is prevalent, it
is important not to feed the trees
too heavily with manures or oth
er nitrogenous fertilizers. En
deavor to keep the trees growing
well without forcing them. In
the case, of pears and quinces it
is oftentimes wise to grow them
in sod.
"In the pasr.summer cutting o
blight has been advised but ex
perience has taught us that this
is usually not successful and the
practical time to cut it out is dur
ing the fall or winter. This
month is a good time of the year
to do it because the blighted
twigs can easily -be found. The
essential point to "remember is
that the blighted branches should
always be removed before the
spring of the year. At this time
the blight bacterium becomes ac
tive and you will notice a sticky
material exuding around the old
blight cankers. This material is
filled with blight bacteria, bees
and other pollenizing insects work
on it and in that way spread the
disease to the twigs and blossoms.
In cutting out the blighted wood
be sure to cut at least six inches
behind the dead portion.
lo cure the cankers on the
trunk or larger limbs of the tree.
cut out all of the diseased bark
and paint, over with lime and
sulphur."

' Farms Increased hi Value.
Carefully complied reports
during the years 1910 to 1915,
indicate that the value of tillable
farm lamds lying along perman
ently improved market roads in
increasea from one to three times
the cost of improving the roads.
An increase of only a few dollars
per acre would be necessary to
cause the foregoing enect on
value.

Beef Cattle Good Investment
We have just read that a west
ern packing company has sixty
refrigerator ships chartered to
carry beef to the armies of Europe
while the present war lasts.
This suggesst other facts con
cerning the cattle situation in the
United States, and, especially,
in Pennsylvania and all the east
ern states. The News readers
have been told how beef-type
herds are decreasing in the West
not that there are fewer cattle
but they are now of the milk and
butter type to supply the demands
for those articles because of the
rapid settling up of western
country by farmers who cultivate
the ground instead of pasturing
it. But even the later type has
not kept pace with the increase
of population all over this
country. Consequently, there is
a relative scarcity of cattle, and
the big packers are looking to
South America for supplies
This means that low-priced cattle
can never again be known in
this country, and slowly but
surely the truth is being driven
home to a slow-thinking public
that instead of spending $12.50
an acre in labor and material to
raise ten barrels of corn worth
$10. these same lands will be
used to grow more cattle to sel
on the hoof to feeders in the corn
belts who cannot afford to give
over their cornlands to pasturage.
1 he mews intends to help our
State Agricultural Department
in the education of the public to
the importance of the cattle
business to the East, and at the
same time, teach truths concern
ing care of pastures, because our
thin, worn-out soils are not now
adapted to abuse of over-pasturing
without the addition of lime
and fertilizers, and occasional
re-seeding without breaking the
steephill sods with plows.
Busy Biddie Brings Riches.
Last week we published statis
tics showing the enormous sum
of money received by residents of
Fulton county for eggs. The
amount seems beyond belief,
but let us see about that.
If 1,000 farmers keep 60 hens
each, they have together, 60,000
hens. For the United States,
each hen averages 7U eggs per
year. Fulton county hens are as
good as the average, so they
must lay 4.200.Q00 eggs, or 350,
000 dozen, which, at 20 cents a
dozen, are worth $70,000. But
more than 1,000 farmers keep 60
hens each, making it very plain
that Fulton county sells between
$100,000 and $150,000 worth of
eggs every year.
Now for the question why more
people do not succeed in making
the egg and poultry business a
success on a large scale for longer
periods than two or three years?
We have given some of the reasons
many times, but they will stand
repetition for the sake of as good
nvestment as poultry on the dry
uplands of this county. Chief
among the reasons for failure is
ack of knowledge of the business.
This lack manifests itself in the
way coops and houses are built,
the lack of care given to insure
against disease; and above all, to
the indifference shown in disre
garding the rules laid down by
those who have spent fortunes on
perfecting systems that insure
success. A tew nens allowed the
freedom of the farm will pick up
a living that leaves a little mar
gin of profit, but when the flock
reaches commercial proportion,
then skilled hands endowed with
unlimited patience are positive
requisites.
It must not be imagined for
one moment that the money re
ceived for eggs is all profit A
very fair estimate of profit even
or small flocks on the farm, is
at the rate of $1 per year for each
hen kept on the place, t locks
of 1,000 and over, do not always
average $1 profit
