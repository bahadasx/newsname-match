NEED OF REVISION
According to the Statement of
Forest, Game and Fish
Warden.
WHEELING, Nov. 16?West Virginia
needs a resident hunter's license law,
J. A. Viquesney, state forest, game and
lisjli warden, of Belington, declared yesterday,
while in Wheeling on his way
tr% PU t aV\ti rcr nn Knolnocu At fhn Incf
VV *. VU V LUw *140 1session
of the legislature. Mr. Viquesnes
attempted to have enacted a law
which provided for a resident 'hunter's
license of $1 in one county or $2 for
the entire state. The law- Anally passed
differed greatly from that urged by Mr.
Viquosney, providing that resident
county licenses be granted free and
that state-wide licenses cost $3.
At the next regular session of the
legislature, Mr. Viquesney will attempt
to have enacted the measure
which he proposed two years ago. Sentiment
has Changed considerably during
the last few years, and the need
of such a measure'is now generally
recognized, he says, and he believes
the bill will now pass.
The proposed measure would produce
between $40,000 and $50,000 in ^
revenue which would maintain the de- <
partment, create funds to carry on the j
work of Ash and game propagation \
and forest preservation, besides pay- ,
ing the bounties provided by the pres
ent law. (
The present law raises between ,
$10,000 and $5,000, which is not suffi- <
cient to carry on all the work of the j
department and pay the bounties. The ]
law provides that ten per cent of the j
collections from licenses shall he ]
turned into a fund from which boun- <
ties are paid. The following rewards
6r bounties are offered: for each wild ?
cat, $5; for each hawk (except spar- j
row or mouse hawk), 25 cents; for j
each horned owl, 25 cents; and for
each'crow, 10 cents.
However, the fund of $1,000' or
$1,200 created under the present law
is sufficient to pay bounties for only
a month or two. Several hundred
claims for killing wild cats were turned
into the department last year, so (
the fund was quickly exhausted.

Many bears and deer are being killed, <

According to reports reaching Mr. A
Vlquesney from different sections of t
the state, game birds are numerous. (
As an experiment the game depart- j
meat a few years ago placed several 7
Chinese rlng-neclc pheasants in about
twenty counties. The birds quickly ,,
became acclimated and have multiplied
until they fix.re now quite numerous.
The experiment was entirely successful,
Mr. Viquesney-says.
Mr. Vlquesney told a newspaper
representative that violations of the; ,
game laws are rare and each year are '
becoming less frequent. The sportsmen,
he said, are fairly well Informed
as to the laws, and tho deputies of the
