called on Foreign Minister von

informative nature. Imperial
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg

American note need not be expected
for several days, and possibly
not before Wednesday.
The United States government has
made tentative plans to cope with
every conceivable situation which
would result from the severance of
diplomatic relations with Germany.
For reasons they indicated were obvious.
officials last night deemed it
unwise to discuss the details.
There is reason for believing, however.
that some of the plans have to
do with the safety of American citizens
in the German empire, and that
others have to do with American supervision
of German interests in the
countries at war with Germany.
Numerous dispatches on these subjects
are understood to have been sent
to diplomatic representatives abroad,
particularly to Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin. The dispatches are regarded
as being highly confidential, and for
mat reason iniuinmuvu wu^v......c
them is unavailable here.
Drastic Tone Unexpected.
Among- dispatches received from
Ambassador Gerard within the past
two days was one describing the manner
in which the American note, declaring
the purpose of the United
States to break relations unless Germany
modified her submarine methods,
was received by German officials.
While this, too, was held as confidential,
it is understood the ambassador
represented Berlin officials as being
greatly surprised at the demands
of the Washington government. Mr.
Gerard is said to have gathered at
least an impression that the foreign
office had no idea that the communication
would be as drastic and final
as It was.
The general feeling here last night
apparently was not at all optimistic
regarding the outcome. In the absence
of further informative advices from
Ambassador Gerard, the day's press
dispatches were read closely. Indications
in them that there might be delays
or requests for additional information
were regarded by officials as
significant. It is well understood,
however, that the United States under
no consideration will permit delay and
discussion unless It is preceded by a
declaration from Germany that she has
so modified her submarine warfare as
to bring it within the scope of International
law.
Dispatches Expected.
Dispatches of an important nature
hourly are expected from Ambassador
Gerard. It is expected that before to'
morrow, or certainly soon thereafter,
the ambassador will be in a position
to forecast, with some degree of accuracy,
what will be the view of the
German government.
In the meantime the situation in
Washington remains one of tense exOfficials
are corfldent that
pome time this week the issue will have
settled; that the United States
will feel certain the safety of inno
ent non-combatants on the high seas
is assured, or steps for a diplomatic
br^ak will have been taken.
Among the foreign diplomats here the
Effect of a break between the United
States and Germany is a topic of wide
interest. The consensus of opinion seems
to be that diplomatic relations between
the United States and the allies of Germany
need not necessarily be affected.
In regard to Austria, however, much is
considered to depend upon the answer
made by the Vienna government to the
American inquiry regarding the attack
upon the Russian bark Imperator, carrying
two American citizens, one of whom
was injured by shrapnel fire.
May Benew Inquiry.
Ambassador Penfleld was directed to
make the inquiry early last week. No
reply had been received last night, and
he may soon be instructed to renew the
inquiry.
It is considered quite probable that
Austria will be called to account should
it develop that her submarines, too, have
not been acting with a proper regard for
the rights of non-combatants, the United
States being determined that illegal submarine
warfare, wherever and by whoever
conducted, must cease.
An appointment was arranged yesterohnirman

Seriate foreign relations committee, tc

but late yesterday the senatoi

REPORT ASKS STATE
RIGHTS IN DISTRICT
Findings of Political Status
Committee Before Board of
Trade Tomorrow Night.
RECOMMENDATION MADE
BY UNANIMOUS ACTION
Representation in Senate. House and
Electoral College, as Proposed by
Chamberlain Measure. Desired.
The special committee of the Board
of Trade on the political status of residents
of the District of Columbia has
unanimously adopted a report to be
I presented, by order of the board of directors.
at the board meeting tomorrow
night. President Brandenburg is
ex-officio chairman of the committee
and the other members are Theodore
\V. Xoyes. .1. H. Cunningham. John Joy
Edson. C. J. Gockeler. E. F. Colladay.
Odell S. Smith and Charles S. Crane.
The report favors:
Status of Citizens of State.
First. The Chamberlain amendment
to the Constitution, which without disturbing
national control of the District
through' Congress, gives to residents of
the District the status of citizens of a
state for the purpose of representation
in the Senate. House and electoral college.
Second. It recommends an amendment
of the Chamberlain amendment by
the insertion of words which shall
cause lesidents of the District to have
also the status of citizens of a state
for the purpose of suing and being sued
in the courts of the United States
under provision.^ of Article III, section
2.
Third. Finally, if Congress finds itself
unwilling to grant at this time directlv
through the Constitution na
tional representation to the District,
the report ur^es that the Constitution
be amended so as to give to Congress
the power to grant this representation
when, in its judgment, the conditions
entitling the District to this status and
this representation have been met.
Alternative Proposition.
This alternative proposition is to
amend the Constitution of the United
States by inserting at the end of section
3. Article IV, the following words:
"The Congress shall have power to
admit to the status of citizens of a
state the residents of the District constituting
the seat of the government Of
the United States, created by Article
I, section 8, for the purpose of representation
in the Congress and among
the electors of President and Vice
President, and for the purpose of suing
and being sued in the courts of the
United States under the provisions of
Article III. section 2.
"When the Congress shall exercise this
power the residents of such District shall
be entitled to elect one or two senators,
as determined by the Congress, representatives
in the House according to their
numbers as determined by the decennial
enumeration, and presidential electors
equal in number to their aggregate representation
in the House and Senate.
"The Congress shall provide by law the
qualifications of voters and the time and
manner of choosing the senator or senators.
the representative or representatives
and the electors herein authorized.
"The Congress shall have power to
make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution
the foregoing power."
The annual reports of several committees
are also to be received at the
meeting of the board tomorrow night,
and also several special reports dealing
with committee recommendations
and referenda from the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States.

Senator Lewis Urges Defensive Alliance
for All the
Americas.
ATLANTA. Ga.. April 22.?A defensive
alliance of all countries of the
western hemisphere was proposed by
Senator Lewis of Illinois, speaking; tonight
before the lawyers of Georgia,
as the only means by which the United
States could avoid early conflict with
countries of Europe and Asia.
"Such an alliance must carry with it
a new doctrine of international law,"
said the senator, "ordaining that any
country violating the fundamental
rights of the republican form of gov1
ernment would be punished by the
combined resentment of the whole
western hemisphere. This punishment
need only take the form of a boycott
of the commercial privileges wl ich
! those assailing countries must seek
' from the United States."
Possibilities of Future.
If the central powers were victorious
[ in the present war. Senator Lewis de\
clared, the United States would be com>
pelled to oppose the force of imperial
; monarchy by a consolidated form of
. government which would transform our
states into political divisions. Then would
j follow efforts on the part of this country
. to arrange treaties of defense with European
powers against feared invasion by
oth^r European powers. If the allies
won. he said, the doctrine of the sovereignty
of small nations would again
be asserted and South and Central American
governments would seek aid from
abroad to their resistance against our
.muiiiuc uwinnc.

I.OXDON. April 2J.? Hard fighting
has been in progress in the Verdun
region and heavy forces have been
thrown into the battle by both sides,
but the changes of ground have not
been notably great.
The struggle seems to have been
most intense in the region of Dead

where French and Germans have taken
turns in launching an offensive.
Paris admits the Germans secured a
foothold in some of the new French
trenches, but declares the ground previously
won was afterward all regained.
Berlin concedes a French gain in the
Caurettes wood, just to the west of
the Meuse. where trnches have frequently

Toward the northern end of the western

in regaining a part of the
ground recently lost to the north of
Ypres. their attack resulting in the
recapture of about 200 yards of the

The Russian troops which landed at

front, passing through the city of Lyon
Saturday. They were given an enthusiastic
greeting all along the route.

Explanation Is Offered.
American army officers here, while refusing
to express a definite opinion or
the troop movement, pointed out thai
it did not necessarily mean that th?
idea of recalling the Pershing expedition
had been abandoned. One offlcei
offered this as a possible explanation:
"We all realize that if the Americar
troops begin to withdraw it may excit*
the various bands of Villa follower*
who are still roaming about northerr
Mexico and who will conclude that the
Americans are leaving because thei
have been defeated. This may easilj
incite them to attacks on our line oi

protected. The additional troops sent
into Mexico may be merely intended a*
a guard for our communications in tht
event of withdrawal."
Believe Withdrawal Possible.
' There Is little question that officer*
here generally believe withdrawal i*
possible. Some of them have privatelj
exnressed the oninion that Gen. Per
shing already lias taken the preliminary
steps in the concentration of his
columns at three or four points, a move
which will enable him to evacuate the
more dangerous pointy of occupatior
with a minimum delay after he receives
orders from Washington.
Renewed anxiety was shown here today
over the grave conditions in Mexico.
Carranza money suffered anothei
decline today, being quoted in a local
broker's office at 1^4 cents on the dollar.
Americans arriving from the interior
are unanimous in their statements
that the situation of the de facto government
is becoming exceedingly precarious,
and that every city they have
passed through food riots were almosl
a daily occurrence.
One American who arrived here from
Durango City described the conditions
in that state as terrible. He said thai
the country people were flocking intc
the cities by thousands, there being
nothing left to eat in the bandit-ravaged
country.

Secretary Baker Expects Him
Back Tomorrow Night or
the Next Day.
CABINET TO CONSIDER
QUESTION ON TUESDAY
Extensive Plan to Capture Peon
Brigand Might Lead to War With
the Carranzistas.
A decision as to whether American
troops will be withdrawn
from Mexico may be reached by
President Wilson and his cabinet
Tuesday. This was indicated last
night when it was reported from
San Antonio that Maj. Gen. Scott,
sent by Secretary Baker to investigate
the military problems
, confronted by Gen. Funston and
his men, might be back in Washington
in time for his report to be
. laid before the regular meeting
of the cabinet on that day.
Secretary Baker declined to discuss
the probable meaning of Gen. Scott's
2 decision to hasten back to the capital
without extending his quest for information
beyond conferences with Gen.
Funston and his officers at department
headquarters. Officials have consistently
refused to say anything whatJ
ever about the problems under con
sideratlon since the request for the
withdrawal of the troops came from
Gen. Carr&nza.
I Funston Wants Reinforcements.
It is known, however, from border
advices that Gen. Funston feels that he
cannot go farther with the pursuit of
Villa than he already has gone unless
he is heavily reinforced and his hands
freed, to some extent at least, in deal- j
ing with problems of supply and infor- '
matlon beyond the border. Gen. Scott's!
deoision to return at once generally!
was taken to mean that he had reached )
1 the same conclusion and would so re- i
port to Secretary Baker.
In this connection It is recalled that |
/ President Wilson specifically rejected i
plans for a more extensive movement:
in pursuit of Villa mapped out by the
" general staff immediately after the Columbus
raid. The scope of those plans
never has been revealed, but it generally
is understood that they contemplated
a virtual military occupation of
S all that part of northern Mexico in
which the bandits might seek refuge. A
t big army would have been required,
and the whole territory would have
i been swept thoroughly so that no Villa :
r follower could escape.
Might Lead to Mexican War.
The administration felt, it has been
- reported, that any such movement' as
this was certain to lead to war with
Mexico. The development of opposition
to the smaller punitive expedition is
held by administration officials to have
borne out this view. This opposition,
they point out. has developed, despite a
formal announcement by the President
himself that the sole object was
the. capture of Villa, and that the sovereigntv
of Mexico would not be imperiled.
There is no reason to*believe that the
administration changed its viewpoint.
If Gen. Scott recommends that the expedition
either be freed of the restraints
Imposed by its friendly nature and
largely reinforced, or withdrawn entirely,
there seems little doubt that the
latter course will be followed.
Could Be Brought Out in Ten Days.
Military officials on the border apparently
take the same view of the probabilities
of the situation. They already
have estimated, according: to press dispatches,
that Gen. Pershing's men could
be brought out in ten days without be5
ing exposed to serious danger of attack
en route.
1 Secretary Baker gave out no dispatches
from the border yesterday,
i Only routine matters were reported.
1 The State Department also was with?
out advices as to the military situaf
tion, although it received confirmation
{ of the fact that Carranza currency had
3 dropped in value in Mexico City to 2
cents on the dollar. Officials said the
financial outlook of the de facto government
appeared to be Increasingly
gloomy.
i BAN ON NEWSCONCERNING

j LONDON, April 22.?An order in
council was adopted today prescribing
i very strict regulations to prevent the
i publication of proceedings of secret
r sessions of parliament or meetings of

tonight sent to Washington what
was said to be a joint report of
the conclusions reached at their
conference here today.

indicate that the two army officials

SAN ANTONIO. Tex . April 22.?M*JGen.
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the
United States Army, tonight had virtually
completed the purpose of his mission
to army headquarters here?the
gathering of first-hand information of
conditions along the border and in Mexico?but
gave no intimation of what
conclusions he reached or recommendations
he will make to Secretary of War
Baker.
Gen. Scott probably will leave tomorrow
for Washington, to make a
personal report to the Secretary of
War. on which. It is believed, a decision
as to whether the United States
punitive expediion will continue in
pursuit of Villa or is to he withdrawn
from Mexico, will be based.
Asked if the withdrawal of the troops
had been decided upon. Gen. Scott replied:
"We have not reached a conclusion."
He nodded his head toward
Gen. Funston when he said "we."
. Have Gone Over Reports.
Since his arrival here last night Gen.
Scott has been with Gen. i-unston alj
most constantly. Together they have
j read such reports as came from the
base at Columbus, from officers along
the line of communication and from
Gen. Pershing. None of these reports
[indicated fresh activity by the American
forces, but Gen. Scott gained at
first hand an idea of the defensive attitude
the punitive expedition has assumed.
Gen. Scott explained that the Secretary
had sent him here for a more comparative
report of the situation than
it had been possible to receive over
the telegraph wires, and that the minute
his work was completed he would
leave for Washington. He was engaged
all day going over records of
the expedition and details of incidents,
both north and south of the boundary.
Gen. Funston placed before the chief
of stafT all the reports from Gen.
Pershing in which Gen. Pershing is
known to have appealed for more
troops and authority to adopt a more
radical method of operations. These
and other reports set forth the antagonism
which the troops have met from
certain Carranza minor officials and
! troops.
Gen. Scott was also given opportunity
to learn just how and why the expedition
was forced into a defensive
position. Instead of continuing the pursuit
of Villa, who now appears to have
escaped into the districts beyond the
furthest advanced detachment of Gen.
Pershing's command.
Ultimatum From Parral Mayor.
There was at his hand the evidence
tending to show that the mayor of
Parra! had served on Col. W. C. Brown
at Santa Cruz what virtually was an
ultimatum after me ngnt at Karrai
that he must not advance further
southward.
It. is understood that the difficulties
met with In maintaining a winding
line of communication 400 miles long,
guarded bv troops, and the Importance
of establishing a shorter route, relieving
a greater part of the punitive force
for duty at the front, was emphasized
by staff officers who conferred with
Gen. Scott.
Gen. Scott also learned in detail of
the movement of Mexican troops in
northern Mexico and of reports, both
official and unofficial, of activities of
men and groups of men who are credited
with plans for fomenting fresh
revolutions against the de facto government.
At departmental headquarters
there also was information that
indicated a plan by certain Mexicans,
some of them Mexican officials, to resume
the raids on the border west of
Brownsville. Implicated in this plan.
it was said, were some of the same
men who participated in them last
summer.
The routine of Gen. Pershing's operations
continued today, and more of
the 2,300 troops ordered to Columbus
by Gen. Funston arrived at the frontier
base. No additional troops naa ne#?n
ordered into this department to take
their places on the border patrol, but
such forces, it was learned today, had
been requested by Qen. Funston.
