Attorney Deceived lourt in
Obtaining Directed Verdict
in the Meyers Case. Is
Charged. .
DIRECTS THAT VERDICT
IN CASE BE SET ASIDE
District Clerk Will Send Pa
pers and Opinion to Su
preme Court According to
Order of Tribunal.
.Tufiir- it. P. Raynoldfl, of the dis
trict court, late yesterday afternoon
suspended Francis K. Wood from
r,.fi,. in the Second judicial district
until further order of the court. Mr.
Womi m accused of perpetrating a
fraud upon the court.
The order for suspension eume
upon a motion made by Harry C. Mil
ler attorney, asking that the verdict
in 'the cane of Ernest Meyers versus
the Meyers Company be set aside on
the ground that it was obtained by
fraud. Judge Raynolds set aside the
verdict in the same order thut sus
pended Mr, Wood.
Judge Kaynolds directed the dis
trict clerk to transmit the original
papers In the case, together with a
copy of his opinion and copies of the
letters filed in the case, to the state
supreme court "to the end that that
court may take such action In regard
to the disbarment of the said Francis
E. Wood as it may deem fit and
proper."
Judge Itaynoids' opinion follows:
"Ernest Meyers, plaintiff, va. the
Meyers company, defendant. No.

"This matter comes up upon a mo
lion to set usiue a verdict which the
court directed in favor of the defend
ant. Tho principal ground for the!
motion, and the only one to be con
sidered, Ik thut the verdict was ob
tained by fraud upon the court. The
facts in the case are somewhat com
plicated und it will he necessary to
set thm up in detail iu order. that!
the point involved may te understood.
(.'"h vsuw of action arose out of
u claim which' the firm of Shu & Co.
uf New York have assigned to the
plaintiff and upon which this eult was
brought.
"It seems that when the Meyers
company was turned over to a new
management, among the agreements
entered Into between the new mem
bers of the firm and the retiring
member, Ernest Meyers, there was an
urticle in regard to the claim of Shaw
A Co. of New York City, which was

tached to this motion and the briefs
on both sides that Francis K. Wood
knew of these facts and had the en
tire correspondence, or copies there,
of, in his possession at the time the
suit was sturted, or at the latest when
tho case wus tried. A demurrer to
tho complaint, filed in this ase, Yas
overruled and the defendant an
swered, averring, among other things,
thut the claim on which the suit was
based had been fully paid off, settled
and discharged. The plaintiff's case
was apparently based upon the prop
edition that the Meyers company,
through Its officers, had ratified und
assumed this contract of claim of
Shaw & Co.. and at the trial introduced
evidence to this effect. During the
course of the trial, the receipt of Kr-
nei Meyers to the Meyers company
was shown to said Ernest Meyers
when he was on the witness
stand, and the following, testi
mony was given in reKurd to it. an
shown by a certified copy of the
stenographer's notes:
(Cross-examination of Mr. Meyers
by Mr. Wood:)
'Q Major. Is that your signa
ture (showing witness a paper) ?
a. es, sir.
" 'Q. You wrote that, did you? I
moan you wrote the signature?
A. 1 wrote the signature.
" 'Mr. Wood: I usk to have this pa
per marked for identification.
" 'Thereupon the paper shown the
witness u marked exhibit 4 for Iden
tification. "'Mr. Wood: We offer In evidence
the paper heretofore identified by the
witness Meyers and marked as exhib
it 4 for Identification.'
" 'Mr. Miller: Wo object to this. It
should have been attached to the an
swer in this case. The answer shows
that they I call the court's attention
to the answer.'
"'Mr. Wood: The answer pleads
payment and this is proof of it.'
' 'Mr. Miller: If they are going to
make any use of any such statement
us that, we are entitled to have It at.
tached to the answer as an exhibit.'
"'Mr. Wood: We are not founding
an action or defense on that paper. It
Is mere proof of payment. Like any
other Item of proof.
" 'The court: What is the an
swer? Pleads payment?
" 'Mr. Wood: Payment, is pleaded,
yos. sir.
"The court: I think that la allow-
able.
" 'Mr. Miller: Exception.
" "Thereupon the paper referred to
Is received in evidence as en hi Ml 4.
" 'Mr. Wood: We rest.
"Upon motion by the defendant's
attorney for Judgment, the court, di
rected the Jury to return a verdict for
the defendant. The motion for new
trial was filed by the plaintiff, and
later amended, but was not passed
upon until the term at which the ease
was tried had expired. A new trial
was then granted, but on motion of
the defendant's attorney, Mr. Wood,
alleging that the court was without
Jurisdiction to grant a new trial after
the term at which the triul was had
had expired, the court being fully con
vinced it was without jurisdiction, set
nside the order granting the new trial.
Thereupon the present motion to set
aside the verdict on the ground of
fraud was filed.
"The case has been elaborately
argued and briefs have been submit
ted on euch side, together with copies
of the correspondence between par
tie to tho suit and 8haw & Company.
The gravamen df the charge Is that
the attorney for the defendant, Fran
cis K. Wood, knowing under what cir
cumstances tlie receipt was obtained
and that no value had been paid for
it. In order to deceive tho court and
have a verdict directed In his favor,
represented to the' court that the re
celpt In question was payment, when
In truth and In fact it was not, but
had been obtained under the circum
stances outlined above, and that said
attorney thereby deceived the court,
and perpetrated a fraud upon It? '
"Tho charge is a serious one. and
the court has given tho matter much
consideration and study. Realizing
that such a charge, if sustained, is In
mv oninion sufficient ground for dis
barring an attorney who is guilty of
it, I have gone into the matter wim
great cure. The vcrdiot was directed
for the defendant when It appeared
to the court that the plaintiff had
given a receipt in full and made a
complete discharge of the liability
upon which the plaintiff based his
suit. At first glance it appears as if
the plaintiff and his attorney should
have known that the defendant had
a receipt signed by him in his posses
sion and have been prepared to meet
it with proper proof. The plaintiff
in his motion for a-new trial alleged
surprise as to this receipt and stated
that he was not prepared to meet n
at the time it was presented. The
court assumed that the claim had
heen Mettled hv the plaintiff and that
the matter had in sonio way been for-
gotten or overlooked by him. e
therefor directed a verdict lor ine
defendant and dismissed the plain
tiff's case. It was certainly careless
ness on the part of plaintiff's attor-
nev not. to have known about tho re
eit,t; which hurl been eriven Dy h'siirarH f,ir the r chta or non-combat-
client, especially as In his amended j antSi tnft t;nted States being deter
answer the defendant alleged pay-1 milled that. Illegal submarine warfare,
meat, but had he known it. he would . Wherever and by whoever conducted,
not have been Justified In oeuevum
that defendant's counsel would use u
as he did without explanation and as
proof of payment.
He must have as-
samed. if be had known about the
receipt in defendant's possession, that
defendant fwould not use it ,as ipay
ment when defendant knew- that it
was not payment. Any other assump
tion would have been that defendant's
counsel would attempt to mislead tne
court.
But It Irf Immaterial whether
counsel for plaintiff, or plaintiff him
self, knew about this receipt, ine
fraud and deception alleged is that
defendant s attorney knew tne receipr
of which his client had poeMlon and
which he introduced as evidence, was
not in payment or Bettlement of plain
tiffs claim, and that he used it to de-
reive the court and Jury. Had plain

Washington, April 22. The United
States government has made tenta
tive plans to cope with every con
ceivable situation which would result
from tho severance of diplomatic re
lations with Germany. l'"or reasons
they Indicated were ohvious, officials
tonight deemed It unwise to discuss
the. details.
There Is reason for believing, how
BREAK OCCURS
WITH GERMANY
ever, that soine of the plans have tolnII!il H..CUred a foothold in some
do with the safety of American citi
zens in the German empire, and the
others have to do with American su
pervision of Herman Interests In the
countries at war with Germany.
Dispatch.. Confidential.
Numerous dispatches on these sub
jects are understood to have been sent
to diplomatic representatives abroad,
particularly to Ambassador Gerard at
Uerlin. The dispatches are regard-'.!
as being highly confidential and for
that reason information concerning
them Is unavailable hero.
Among dispatches received from
Ambassador Gerard within the past
two days, was one describing tho
States to break relations unless Ger
m I IfS ill HilH ITT lli.LIIMin LI 1 1 I I. C7 7
many modified her submarine meth
ods was received by German officials.
While this, too, was held as confiden
tial, it is said the ambassador re
ported Berlin officials. as being great
ly surprised at the demands of the
Washington government. Mr. Gerard
Is said to have gathered ait leat an
Impression that the foreign office had
no idea that the communication would
be as drastic and final as It was,
HoK' for ivaoo Warns.
The general feeling here tonight ap
parently was not all optimistic re
garding the outcome. In the absence
of further informative advices from
Ambassador Gerard, the day's press
dispatches were read closely.
Indications in them that there
might 'be delays or requests for addi
tional information were regarded by
officials as significant. It is well un
derstood, however, that the United
States under no consideration will
permit delay and discussion unless it
is preceded by a declaration from
Germany that she has so modified her
submarine warfare as to bring it
within the scope of international law.
Forty l'reoast Kipoetod.
Dispatches of an important nature
hourly are expected from Ambassador
Gerard. It is expected , that before
Monday, or certainly soon thereafter,
the ambassador will be in a position
to forecast with some degree of ac
curacy what will be the view of the
Gorman government.
In the meantime, the situation In
Washington remains one of tense ex
pectancy. Officials are confident thut
beforo this time next week, the issue
will have been settled; that the Unit-
f ed Slates will feel Certain the safety
of innocent non-combatants on tne
high seas is assured, or steps of a dip
lomatic break will have been taken.
Center of Diplomatic InUwst.
Among the foreign diplomats here,
the question of u break between the
United states and Germany is a toplo
of wide interest. The consensus of
opinion seams to be that diplomatic
relations between the United States
and the allies of Germany need not
necessarily be affected. In regard to
Austria, however, much is considered
to depend upon the answer nuule by
the Vienna government to the Ameri
can Inquiry regarding the attack
upon the Russian bark Imperator,
carrying two American citizens, one
of whom was Injured by shrapnel fire.
Ambassador Penfleld was directed to
make tho Inquiry early this week. No
reply had been received today, and he
may soon be instructed to renew the
Inquiry.
It Is considered quite probable that
Austria will be called to account

An appointment was nrrajiged to

foreign situation, but late today the
senator sent word to the. White

received and In nddi-
. , fh t tf provided him with
. evidence, verbal and writ-
ten, as bore on the case. As to the
conclusions General Scott had reach
ed and the nature of the report he
would make, he was non-coinmitlal.
He was asked If H hud been decided
to withdraw Hhi troops and replied:
"We have not reached a conclusion."
He, nodded his head toward General
ITuujton when ho snid "we."
General Funston placed before the
chief of stuff all the reports from
General Pershing already sent to
Washington in which General Persh
ing is known to have appealed for
more troops and for radical changes
in operations. These and other re
ports set forth with specific clearness
the embarrassment which the troops
have met from Carranza minor of
ficials and from Carranza troops and
the unmistakable lack of co-operation.
General tfett was also given op.
portunity to learn Just how and why
the expedition wus forced Into a de
fensive position Instead of continuing
; the pursuit of Villa, who now appears
to have escaped into the districts be-
yond the furthermost advanced de
tachment of General Pershing's com
mand. There was at his hand the
evidence that the mayor of Parral had
served on Colonel W. C. Ilrown, at
Santa Cruz, an ultimatum, after the
fight at Parral, that he must not ad
vance another soldier southward.
Reviewing the transportation prob
lem, reports from General Pershing
and other made apparent the oddity
of malntalng rt 400-mile winding line
of communication guarded by thou
sands of troops when a much shorter
route could b used, relieving for ac
tive duty at the front a great part of
the punitive force.
Villa's Caplure Vol, Probable.
It was regarded here as probable
that General Funston would concur
in a report stating that the capture of
Villa with the present organisation
opernllng along Die same lines was!v niniost Mill miles south of tho bor-itlon
Improbable.
In view of the protest by Carranza
and the evident antagonism encoiiu-
tered, it also has become evident that
Increased activity probably would
meet with formal armed opposition
by the do facto government troops.
In these conclusions army men here
take it for granted the chief of staff
will concur, thus tanking it necessary
for the administration to decide ai .
an eaiiv dute the nature of future
errillons in Mexico. .
