This decision was not reached until
practically every member of the board
had given voice to his views, many of
them taking th?* stand that, since the
two railroads, after holding a meeting
in this city and Inspecting the various
suggested sites, had definitely agreed
on the Hermitage location against the
protest of many business men, there
remained nothing to do but abide by
the roads" decision lloldir u this opin
ion, which was that any action the
chamber might take would have no
weight with the two companies, a num
ber of the directors could sec no rea
con for holding a special meeting of
the entire bod* of tbe organization.
The meeting of the directors was
' "o d promptly at 10:30 o". Io. k. but
it wa , nearly noon before the mem
bers were read\ for a vote. The
speeches had occupied a great part of !
the morning, and there was some doubt
as to Which wa> tin- motion was KoinR. 1
After a second count, the tir-t showing
only a majority ..f one vote, it was
decided to hold the public meeting on
Wednesday. the directors agreeing
that no action on their part was
necessary, .since the entire matter -\v:t>? 1
to be presented to the body of the

together with a second call for the 1
nias.-:-meeting. The statement follows: |
Tc. the .Members of the Richmond
t 'hamher of Commerce:
The chamber is on record by a reso
lution of its board of April "4, lyl2^
favoring a union passenger station at '
I'iftcenth and Main Streets, for all'
railroads entering Richmond. This ac
tion was confirmed by resolution of a :
subsequent board June IS. U'Kl. At
a meeting of the present hoard, held
February 3, i?ic, it belt g considered bv
a majority of t Ho directors present!
almost, if not entirely, impossible to j
Induce the Kichmond. Fredericksburg !
and Potomac Railroad and the At- i
Jantic Coast Lino Railroad to join in
the use of a station at the location stat
ed above, and the board being informed
that the < oast I.ino and the Richmond,
Fredericksburg and Potomac had de
termined to erect an uptown passengt r
station, and w. re undecided as to
whether it should be located on the
Hermitage <;.?!}" tirounds or at Uroad
Street and the Belt Line road, and i
being further informed that the opin
ion of the ' hamher as to a preference
for one of these site.-- over the other?
would be appreciated by the t\\ ?
roads, passed a resolution favoring the |
location of the proposed depot at Uroad '
Street and the licit Lino road, in
preference to the Hermitage station.
The Richmond. Fredericksburg ami
Potomac and the Atlantic Coast Line
roads, at a meeting of their directors
held April 20, determined to build the ,
depot on the Hermitage site.
The directors of the chamber think I
it best for th:s whole, question to ;
considered by the entire membership!
Of our organization, thus affording an
opportunity for a full and free ex-I
prcssion of opinion on the part of!
every member, and having given above
all the information in its possession,
the hoard hopes that some definite and '
final conclusion will be reached at the
meeting oi, the 26th. which, being the
action of a majority of our members,
would deserve and .should receive the
support of every member of the cham
ber.

devised plot to kill J. Pierpont Morgan ;
was revealed to-day when Harry 1.,. 1
!
Newton was arraigned in the Tombs i
Court oji a charge of "intent to commit
;i rrimc." The specific allegation is;
that he offered to lake the life of the j
tinancier if paid $10,000 by German
agents.

Galley is of German extraction. The J
plot was frustrated by him. Galley i
says in the atlidavit that he inei New
ton about tun days ago. lie suites '
that Newton made a verbal offer to j
him to murder Mr. Morgan for ?10,000. !
Newton declared he would demand no
money until after the crime hail been
committed.
Hi; offered ti? show his loyalty to the
German cause in any way demanded,
and agreed to carry out any orders
tending to show that he had nerve
enough to carry the plan to ti sue- J
cessful conclusion.
According to ;i statement made by
Captain liarnit/.. In charge of the bomb
and arson squad. Galley went to po
lice headquarters and mado known the
offer made him by Newton. Galley
told the police he promised Newton he
would place him In touch with tJer

in carrying out the schnie.

the case. Ho poseil as the German of
ficial. Seinpfs, in his affidavit, says
that ho and Galley went to a branch

they met Newton. Sempfs says he was

Newton, it is alleged, then again
went over his plans for killing the
tinancier. He (Newton) said lie could
commit the crime in either one of two
wa>s. The llrst way was to gain
access t.> Mr. Morgan's ofliee, and thcro
shoot h 1111.
Tin* second way?and best, according
to Newton's idea?would be to hire an
aUtomohile. He would follow Mr. Mor
gan's automobile when it took him to
his home in Glen Cove. 1.,. 1.
Newton's plan, says the atlidavit, was
to shoot ahead of the Morgan machine
while on a country road and tiie.ro

said this would effectually stop the
Morgan automobile, and it would l>o an
easy matter for him to shoot Mr. Mor

REFUSE TO DISCUSS DETAILS
Numerous Dispatches on Subject

Keeling in Washington Not at All
Optimistic Over Outcome.
WASHINGTON. April 22.?The United
States government has made tentative
plans to cope with every conceivable
situation which would result from the
severance of diplomatic relations with
Germany. For reasons they indicated
were obvious, ofllcials to-night deemed
it unwise to discuss the details.
There Is reason for belloving, how
ever. that some of the plans have to
do with the safety of American citizens
in the German empire, and that others
have to do with American supervision
of German interests in the countries
at war with Germany.
Numerous dispatches on these sub
jects are understood to have been sent
to diplomatic representatives abroad,
particularly to Ambassador Gerard, at
Merlin. The dispatches are regarded
as being highly confidential, and for
that reason information concerning
them is unavailable here.
Among dispatches received from Am
bassador Gerard within tho past two
days was one describing the manner
In which the American note, declaring
the purpose of the United States to
break relations unless Germany modi
fied her submarine methods, was re
ceived by German ofllcials. While this,
too, was held as confidential, it is un
derstood the ambassador reported Mer
lin officials as being greatly surprised
at the demands of the Washington gov
ernment.
Mr. Gerard is said to have gathered
at least an impression that the For
eign Ofllce had no idea that the com
munication would be as drastic and
final as it was.

NOT AT A I.I. OPTIMISTIC
The general feeling hero to-night
apparently was not at all optimistic
regarding the outcome. In the absence
of further informative advices from
Ambassador Gerard, the cfay's press
dispatches were read closely, Indica
tions in them that there might bo de
lays or requests for additional Infor
mation were regarded by oflicials a*
significant. II is well understood, how
ever. that the United States under no
consideration will permit delay and
discussion, unless it is preceded by
a declaration from Germany that she
has so modified he.r submarine warfare
as to bring it within tho scope of in
ternational law.
IMspatrhcs of an important nature

Gerard. It Is expected that before
