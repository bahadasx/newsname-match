ARDMORE MOTOR ASSOCIATION
ACHIEVES TANGIBLE RESULTS
AND MEMBERSHIP IS RAPIDLY
INCREASING.
Plans of the Ardmore Molor Asso
ciation to make Ardmore a way -point
on one of the arteries of the great
transcontinental system of highways,
which is being promulgated by the Na

vards radiating to all points of the
compass, and to connect the metropolis
of Carter county with the surrounding
country that needs us to market its
vast wealth of oil, mineral deposits
and products of the soil, are rapidly
maturing.
Road to City Lake
Among the projects for immediate
completion is a well-graded, well-oiled
and thoroughly rolled piece of high
way to the city lake. Work has al

route, and the latter the Interstate
Postal Highway.
This is a great achievement for the
Ardmore Motor Association and is due
to a great extent to the tireless efforts
of Col. Suggs. The latter was sent by
the association to the National High
ways Congress which was held in San
Francisco last fall. Steps are now be
ing taken to organize the different
cities along this proposed route in Ok

have a capital of $."il.0iiil,ililii, will he
known as the Sinclair Oil Refining
company.
Local refiners said that the C. H.
Shaffer oil producing and refining in

CHURCH TODAY
SPECIAL EASTER SERVICE WITH
APPROPRIATE MUSIC WILL BE
FEATURES THAT SHOULD AT
TRACT EVERY CITIZEN.
At the union tabernacle this morn
ing ai II o'clock all the protestant
churches of the city will engage in a
great Easier service. This will un
doubtedly be one of the most impress
ive scenes ever witnessed in Ardmore.
Evangelist M. II. Williams will preach
the Easter sermon on the subject:
"The Fact of Christ, -and Is He
Risen?" Special music will, be ren
dered by the big chorus under the
the direction of Prof. II. J. Bray.
This afternoon at 2:. 10 o'clock Dr.
Williams will deliver a lecture on the
subject: "Where Hoys and Girls
Play in the Street." This service is
especially for children and young
people, but not exclusively so. All
are invited, young and old. Tonight
the evangelist will make a special
address to the business and profes
sional men of the city on the subject;
"The Business and Professional Man
and His Relation to the Church and
Community."
The meeting has been In progress
for just one week and a great awak
ening is being accomplished. So far
Dr. "Williams has devoted himself to
the church and its members, hoping
to arouse an earnest Interest on the
part of such In the meeting. His ser
mons have been spiritual and instruct
ive. He stated in an after-meeting
Friday night that it takes about a
week usually for the people to be
come acquainted with the evangelist,
and that he has devoted the week
to getting acquainted, and that
he Is now ready to begin the
revival In earnest, that from this
time on he will make strong appeals
to those out of the church. He urged
consecrated work on the part of all
the churches.
Dr. Williams, in his sermon Friday
night, used for his text the words of
David in the one hundred forty-second
Psalm, "No man cared for my
soul. He stated: "If those words
were literally true, as the writer
thought they were, they are the sad
dest words ever written. They are
supposed to have been written by
David when he was in refuge. Some
times I think David was the greatest
character in Old Testament history-"
Here Dr. Williams gave his reasons
for his admiration of David and elab
orated on his killing of the giant,
Goliath. In speaking of David's ph
sical strength, he said: "David had
never drank beer, smoked cigarettes
or hung over a pool table. He stayed
out doors in the day time and In bed
at night."
"Sometimes we seem to care more
for the bodies of our friends than we
do for their souls. I do believe that
the American people are the most
charitable people in the world.
Whenever people need money for
famines, drouths, earthquakes and
fires, all they have to do is to let
the United States know It, and they
