WASHINGTON. April 22. The
United State government has made
tentative plans to cope with every con
ceivable situation which would result in
the severance 'of diplomatic relations
with Germany, h'or reasons which they
indicated were obvious, officials tonight
deemed it unwise to discuss the details.
There is reason for believing, how
ever, that some of the plan have to do
with the safety of American citizens in
the German empire, and the others have
lo do with American supervision of
German interests in the countries at
war with Germany.
Numerous dispatches on these sub
ject" are understood to have been sent
to diplomatic representatives abroad
particularly to Berlin. Dispatches are
regarded as being highly confidential
and for that reason information con
cerning them is unavailable here.
Among the dispatches received from
Amlwssador Gerard within the past
two days, was one describing the man
ner in which the American note de

States to break relations unless Ger
many modified her submarine methods,
was received by German officials.
While this, too, was held as confiden
tial, it is understood the ambassador
represented Berlin officials as being
greatly surprised at the demands of the
Washington government. Mr. Gerard
is said to have gathered at least an im
pression that the foreign office had no
idea that the communication would be
us drastic and final as it was.
The general feeling here tonight ap
parently was not all optimistic regard
ing the outcome. In the absence ol

The Vossische Zeitung further says
that a breach of diplomatic relations
would be a very grave occurrence,
the results of which must be weighed
most conscientiously.

Theodore Wolf, editor of the Tage-
blatt, furnishes the most noteworthy
comment on the American note.
An article written apparently in
calm and friendly spirit reviews the
facts and promises in the case and
closes: The vast majority of tne
German nation wishes no war wi;n
America. Light minded oliliciaiis
and writers who indulge in strong
war poses may underestimate such
an increase in the enemies of the
German nation. However, we will
bear the worst, if the worst cannot
be prevented.
It is to be desired that the leaders
themselves find a proper course. The
imperial chancellor is now at grand
headquarters. Never since the be
ginning of the war has a graver
question called together the guard
ians of the empire."
Regarding the Sussex case itself,
Herr Wollf laments the loss of non-
combatants and says: "The Ger
mans could have no wish to torpedo
unarmed ships and destroy non mili
tant life, such a procedure fulfilling
no military purpose. The German
government has not taken the stand
point that the torpedoing of an un
armed merchantman is permissible
since it concedes the principle of the
inviolabilty of unarmed hips. It
did not refer to the fact that the
Sussex was in the war zone, it only
considers the guilt of the German
submarine as not proven, and the
case as doubtful at least. It formed
the only verdict which It could form
on the evidence."
The Hoersen Zeitung says: "The
German answer will inaugurate a new-
phase in the world war which may
have an important bearing on the
issue. Therein lies the signifcance
of Amercan note."
The paper evidently is uncertain
as to what answer should be given
land advises the public to leave the
decision with the government.
"Whether the government- can de
tide to renounce its most effective
weapon against its arch-enemy, En
gland." it says, "depends upon cir
cumstances which an outsider can
appreciate. There is no occasion for
blind aggressiveness or downheart
edness."

WASHINGTON. April 22. The
question as to whether and when the
troops will be withdrawn from Mexico
may he reached by President Wilson
and his cabinet Tuesday. This was
indicated today when it was reported
from San Antonio that Major General
Scott, sent by Secretary Baker to in
vestigate the military problems con
fronted by General Kimston and his
men might be back in Washington in
time for his report to be laid before
the regular meeting of the cabinet on
that day.
Secretary Baker declined to discuss
the political meaning of General
Scott's decision to hasten back to the
capital without extending his quest
for information beyond conferences
with General Funston and his officers
at department headquarters. Off-
cials have consistently refused to say
nything whatever about the problems
under consideration since the request
for the withdrawal of the troops came
from General Carranza,
It is known, however, from border
idvices, that General Funston feels
that he cannot go farther with the

gone unless he is heavily reinforced

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 22. Secre
tary Daniels transmitted to the sen
ate today his response to the Lodge
resolution amendment of April 12 call
ing upon him to submit a letter from
the navy board dated August 3, 1914,
and a communication from Rear Ad
miral Bradley A. Fiske then aide,
for operations, dated November 9,
1914. The communication was de
scribed in the resolutions as warn
ing the secretary that the navy was
unprepared for war. They were first
mentioned publicly when Represent
tative Britton asked Mr. Daniels to
produce them during his examination
before the house naval committee
recently and he refused. .
Search of the files or the navy
department and the .general board
failed to disclose, however, any such
letter from the general board as that
mentioned in the resolution, accord
ing to Secretary Daniels. A letter from
Admiral Dewey president of the board
containing this statement is trans
mitted.
Admiral Fiske's letter is a careful
analysis of the situation of the navy
in the early days of the European
war and contains the statement that
"if this country avoids war during
the next five years, it will be ac
complished only by a happy com
bination of high diplomatic skill and
rare good fortune." It asserts that
the navy was then short 19,000 men
and that while the ships were well
organized and "pretty well drilled'
the department itself was neither
"organized nor drilled in elementary
warf a re."
"Perhaps this is nobody's fault," the
letter continues, "and may be at
tributed to the fact that our navy
has never hud to fight a serious ene
my: certainly not in a hundred years.
Admiral Fiske then appends an ar
gument for the creation of a naval
general staff. Commenting on thi
letter Secretary Daniels in his com
munication to the senate says: "This
communication was not furnished to
me and T did not know of its exis
tence until after it was written. It
was filed with the chief clerk with-!
out my knowledge that it had been
written. Although Rear Admiral
Fiske was in my office daily he did
not tell me that he had placed the
communication on file."
The secretary adds that the first
search of the files of his department
had failed to disclose the Fiske
letter as it had been looked for by
an officer who "looked it up several
times but could not find it." The
copy transmitted he adds, was ob
tained by the department from Ad
miral Fiske at Mr. Daniels' request.
Seventy-one 'delegates to the re
publican state convention were nam
ed at yesterday's county conven
tion. and instructed by resolution to
support Ralph H. Cameron for na
tional committeeman. And that is as
far as anybody got with "instruct
ing resolutions." With a deal of
new blood, and a pitch of interest
that has not been reached in re
publican circles hereabout for many-
many years, the .convention progress
ed smoothly, in the hands of chair
man Earl Curtis, who was elected
in the first sharp skirmish of the
day.
No contests were entertained
the committee on credentials, and 1
although its report contained a few
errors, due to careless certificates,
it seated a convention of 165 mem
bersa surprisingly good representa
tion out of the 194, elected at lasi
Monday's primaries.
I 'pon the call by County Chairman
Jack White, the first battle line was
drawn. C. W. Hartman secured the
floor and nominated Earl Curtis for
temporary chairman. Fred Holm
quist followed with the nomination of
Judge Sloan. As the rising vote was
being counted, and it - appeared cer
tain Curtis had received a majority,
Judge Sloan courteously moved to
make the election unanimous. The
convention settled down for a joyous,
old time contest, that appeared ani
mated only when the matter of
pledging developed during the after
noon session.
Howard B. Claflin was named tem
porary secretary.
Chairman Curtis named this cre
dentials committee: W. P. Mealey,
Leo Bigley, F. D. Blackmer, Jeff Dun
can and Robert S. Fisher. The roll
took about an hour to make up, fol-
iwing which delegates and proxies
ere seated.
Frank Stewart tlien offered, his
resolution, endorsing Cameron for
National committeeman, and the vote
as strong and also viva voce.
The convention then began to gath
r impetus toward its real object.
George Norman Mac.Bean moved the
appointment of a committee to bring
the names of 71 delegates, to the
Tucson convention. The purpose of
the committee, he explained, was not
so much to nominate a set of dele
gates, as to discover if a full dele
gation of il could not be named.

The chairman named MacBeau

W. S. Pickrell and H. C. Wikoff on
this committee, and a motion was
made to recess until two o'clock
George Kirkland sought the floor,
but was refused the privilege, al
though the chairman allowed he
would recognize Mr. Kirkland just as
soon as the wheels began to go
round once more. Mr. Kirkland
seemed visibly satisfied with this.
A Popular Delegation
When lunch had been eaten and
cigars smoked and the watches scan
ned many times, it impressed the
reassembled throng that the com
mittee was taking a long time about
Its business. The word was circu
lated that the perspiring five could
not find enough chaps who were
sure they could go to the Tucson
convention, and instantly, the door
was besieged by forty who wanted
to offer their services. The com
mittee politely remarked that it had
the names of 192 men, each of whom
was absolutely certain of making
the trip, if named, and that the clif-
diculty lay not in filling the list but
in filing it down to the limit of 71
At last, in despair, the committee
shuffled the names into two lists,
called one "delegates" and the other
"alternates" and made ready to re
port. It had been understood that
nominations would be made from the
floor, to fill vacancies.
Then, the nearest approach to fire-

Hard fighting has been in progress
in the Verdun region and heavy forces
have been thrown into the battle by
both sides, but the changes of grounil
have not been notably great.
The struggle seems to have been
most intense in the region of Dead
Man's hill north. west of the fortress,,
where French and Germans have taken'
turns in launching an offensive.
Neither side claims any gains, as a
result. Paris admits that the Germans
secured a foothold in some of the new
French trenches, but declares th3
ground previously won was afterward
all regained.
Berlin concedes a French gain ip the
Caurcttes wood, just lo the west of
the Meuse, where trenches have fre
quently changed hands.
Toward the northern end of thj
western tattle line, the, British have
succeeded in regaining a part of the
ground recently lost to the north y

recapture of about 200 yards of the

WASHINGTON, April 22. Officers

During the year, the report says, 629
enlisted men out of every thousand in
the army were admitted to the sick re

the rate of 498 per thousand, and due
to injury, 131. The average disability
asted 13 1-2 days and the average num

Government employes in Washing

16,000 persons, cost only 5.84 days
apiece, on an average for disability, or
nearly three days each less a year than
enlisted men. The report says the
service was at a loss to understand this,
inasmuch as a large percentage of gov
ernment employes are in middle or el
derly life while the big majority of en
listed men are in their twenties.
Men employed in the government
