MU Brown Will Sins at First
Methodist, While St Paul'
Choir Will be Augmented.
Easter comes later than usual this
year, and as this fact serves to make
weather conditions more propitious
the principal churches in Columbus
have arranged for an unusually
elaborate festival.
As is customary, music will form
a prominent feature of the Easter
services, and at several local houses
of worship the regular choirs will
be augmented by talented musicians
who have kindly consented to lend
their presence and their voices to
the effort which is being made to
make the occasion one worthy of
more than passing note. At the
First Methodist church the regular
choir will on this evening be aided
by Miss Mattie Lou Brown, head "6f
the department of vocal music at th
Industrial . Institute and College,
Miss Mary Lou Peyton, Mr. Ira L.
Gaston and Mr. Legare Bailey, and
the ensemble will be heard in a
beautiful Easter cantata, "Christ,
the King," by Paul Bliss. A beautiful
program has also been arranged for
tne morning services at St. PaulV
Episcopal church, on which occasion
the choir will include Misses Zaida
Musselwhite, Ellie Williams, Mar
garet Rhett, Elisabeth Roth, Bessie
Smith, Cora Cook, Elizabeth Law
less, Rosalie Rhett, Mesdames J. P.
Woodward, Bailey Hardy, J. L.

Within the twelve cycles of the
moon, from 1788 to 2013 inclusive,
Easter occurs only eight times as
late as it does this year, three times
in the last and three times in the
present century. In this century in
1905, 1916 and 1943. Thirty years
ago Easter was, and in 1943, will be
on the latest possible day it can
happen April 25. While in 1913
the feast came on March 23, an
event that will not occur again until
2008 A. D.
Christmas, Easter and Whitsun
days commemorating as they do the
Incarnation and Resurrection of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
and the descent of the Holy Spirit
on the early church ten days after
His Ascension, are the great days of
obligation, and there cluster around
them minor days as lesser lights
around some great planet in order
that the faithful who could not com
mune on the great festivals them
selves may have opportunity to "do
this in remembrance of Me," the
command of our Lord, when He in
stituted the Holy Eucharist, in the
upper room the night before He was
crucified. There wtfll therefore te
a celebration of the Holy Commun
ion at St. Paul's church on Monday
' and Tuesday of this week at 10
o'clock a. m. Litany will be said on

nell, and Will be Close.
The second Democratic primary
to dcierminu who is to serve as
chief executive of the city of Co
lumbus during the biennial period
beginning January 1, 1917, will be
held next Tuesday, and is inciting
almost as much interest as the
first contest, which occurred last
Tuesday, and which resulted in the
nomination of six councilmen and
, four puhic school trustees, leaving
j the mayoralty race the only one un-
I decided.
1 The impending "race
is between
Hon. W. C. Gunter, the present
mayor, and Hon. E. S. Donnell, who
efficiently served as chief executive
of the city for nearly a decade prior
to his defeat by Mr. Gunter two
years ago. In the first race Mr.
Gunter received 320 votes and Mr.
Donnell 313, Hon. Louis Shull, who
was also a candidate, was given 1 08
votes, and, having been the" lowest
man, naturally retired from the
race. Mr. Gunter and Mr. Donnell
are both making strenuous efforts
to secure the support accorded to
Mr. Shull in the first primary. Both
I ve strong friends working in their
behalf, and the Contest promises to
be an exceedingly close one.

named by the Municipal Democratic
Executive Committee to

being made by the Stephen I). Lee

Confederacy, and the coming of the
'day is being anticipated with a great
, deal of interest.
I The beautiful custom of paying
annual tribute to the gallant men
: who lost their lives in the defense
' of the Confederacy, by placing
j flowers upon their graves originated
' in Columbus, and for a long time
; Decoration Day was celebrated here
; with the glorious solemnity befitting
the occasion. During recent years,
however, interest has been gradually
abating, and the Daughters of the
Confederacy, with the view of re
viving this interest, have arranged
an unusually elaborate program for
the coming celebration.
The local camp of Confederate
Veterans, which originally hud a
large membership, has dwindled
down to thirty, and these grizzled
heroes will participate in the cele
bration. The city hull will be the
place of amalgamation, and the
procession will leave there at 4:00
o'clock p. m. proceeding to friend
ship cemetery, where the Memorial
Kervice will take place. Rev. W. S.
