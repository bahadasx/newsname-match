OKLAHOMA CITY, April 22.
What had been announced as a
meeting of the new Republican com
mittee here this afternoon for the
purpose of advising ' Republicans
throughout the state how and what
to do under the new Democratic reg
istration law, whipped Itself around
Into one of the liveliest contests be
tween forces of J. J. McUraw and
Jumes A. Harris, for national com
mitteeman, and the real announced
purpose of the meeting was taken
up a few minutes before the com
mittee adjourned. '
The Harris men secured control
and kept it and used It. Only at the
lust did . they relinquish the cinch
they had. As a result of the ad
vantage of Harris men, John D. Ap
pleby of Hobart, campaign manager
for Harris for national committee
man, was elected permanent secre
tary of the state committee, and
Herb House, a Harris man. was
seated as member of the state com

Arthur H. Geissler on a point of
order made previous to the taking up
of the election of a secretary.

EL PASO. April 22. The crossing
of additional American troops in
to Mexico from Columbus today
caused a feeling approuchlng dismay
among Mexican officials in Juarez,
who were previously convinced that

the point of withdrawal. General (in-

"I do not understand why addition

American army olficers here, while
refusing to express tiny definite opin
ion on the troop movement, pointed
out that it did not necessarily mean
that the idea of recalling the Per
shing expedition had been abandoned,
i 'lie officer offered this as a posi
tive explanation:
"We nil realize that if the American
troops begin to withdraw it may ex
cite tho various bands of Villistas who
still are roaming about north Mexico
and who will conclude that the Amer

been defeated. This may easily in
cite them to attacks on our line of

WASHINGTON. April 22. Tho
L'nitcd .Ntutts government has
made tentutive pluns to cope with
every conceivable situation which
would result from tha severance of
diplomatic relations with Germany.
Fur obvious reasons officials tonight
deemed It unwise to discuss the de
tails. Thcro Is reason for believing, how
over, that some of tho plans huve to
do with the safety of American citi
zens In the German empiro and that
others have to do with American
supervision of German Interests In the
countries at war with Germany,
Numerous dispatches on these sub

to diplomatic representatives abroad,
particularly to Ambassador Getard at
llerlln. The dispatches are regarded
as being highly confidential.

Among dispatches received from
Ambassador Gerard within the past
two days was one describing the man
ner in which tha American note de

While this too. was held as confiden
tial, It is understood that the ambus
sador represented Merlin ol'fiiinls as
being greatly surprised at the de

ment. Mr. Gerard is said to have
gathered ut least an Impression that
the foreign office had no Idea that the
communication would be as drastic
uml final as it was.
The general feeling here tonight ap
parently was not at all optimistic re
garding the outcome In the absence
of further Informative advices from
Ambassador Gerard the day's press
dispatches were read closely. Indi
cations In them that there might be
delays or requests for additional In
formation were regarded by officials
as significant. It Is well understood,
however, that the United States under

Lo, how mid melting melodies of mirth
In hill mid dale, was conquered winter's gloom!
Now blossoms, flower iind winded minstrelsy
Join in n psalm of immortulity.
But where will liiijrerin; life look for lost love,
The death-dimmed eye. the hand, the heurt grown cold!
Alone, alus, through verdant fields I rove,
I'nmoved by joyous notes in wood and wold
Each seed springs forth in bud and blade and bloom,
Hut who will roll the stone from off the tomb!
Yet this I know, wherever we may meet.
Hearts hallowed by tho hearth of auld lang syne,
Around mo still you live with influence sweet
And lead my faltering step to heights divine
Aye, when the lovelorn soul sighs " where t"
You whisper softly "in a Father's eare."

HUNT AT STANDSTILL
General Belief Is That
Army Will Be Ordered
Out of the Country.
WASHINGTON. April 22. A ite.
I'lt.ioii us to whether American
troops will be withdrawn from Mex
ico may be reached by President Wil-
i.on unci his cabinet Tucsduy. This
was Imltcuted tonight when It was
reported from Sun Antonio that Ma-Jor-Generul
Scott, 8nt by Secretary
Kaker to lnvcstlexta the military
problems confronted by General Fun
Hton, might be buck In Washington in
lime for his report to bo luid beforo
the regular meeting of the ce.binet on
thut day.
Secretary linker c!(cllnud to discuss
the protiahlo meaning of flcneral
colt's decision lo hasten buck to the
lapltal without extending his quest
for information beyond conferences
with General Funston and his officers
at department headquarters. Offi
cials consistently have refused to say
unyihlng whateior about the problems
under consideration since tho request
tor tho withdrawal ol the troops came
from General Cirrnnza.
It Is known, however, from border
advices that General Funston feels he
cannot go further with tho pursuit of
Villa than he already has gone un
less he is heavily reinforced and bis
hands freed in dealing with problems
of supply and Information beyond the
border. General Scott's decision to re
turn at once generally was taken to
mean that ho had reached the same
conclusion and would so report to
Secretary Raker.
OhJ.-clN to Plans.
In this connection It Is recalled thut
President Wilson specifically reject
ed plans for more extensive movement
in pursuit of Villa mapped out by tho
general staff immediately after the
Columbus raid. The scope of those
plans never has been revealed, but it
is understood generally they contem
plated a vlrtuul mlltlury occupation
of all that part of northern Mexico
in which the bandits might seek
refuge. A hg army would huve been
required and the whole territory
would have been swept thoroughly so
that no Villa follower could escape.
The udministrutlon lelt, it has been
reported, that any such movement as
this wus certain to leud to war with
Mexico. The development of opposi
tion to the smaller punitive expedition
is hold bv udmlnistrutioii officials to
huve borne out tills view. This oppo
sition, they point out, hus developed
despite formal announcement by the
president himseir that the-sole object
was the capture of Villa and that the
