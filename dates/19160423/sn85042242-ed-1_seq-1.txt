$500,000 PROJECT
WELL UNDER WAY
Everyone Is a Booster for Bis
marck Betterment and Work
for Good Streets.
A whirlwind finish this week will,
it is believed, bring to a successful
close the Commercial club's campaign
for a nine-mile paving district. The
signture of every large property-hold­
er in Bismarck, with a very few ex­
ceptions, is already attached to the
petitions which it is hoped to present
to the city commission one week
from tomorrow, and with a dozen pav­
ing enthusiasts pledged to work ener­
getically for the cause this week, it
should be an easy matter to bring in­
to the fold the small percentage of
frontage still required.
Among the more influential citizens
and larger property-holders who al­
ready have "signed up" are the fol­
lowing: C. B. Little, A. W. Lucas, E.
A. Williams, R. D. Hoskins, W. E.

The above list is not complete,' as
it was impossible last evening to ob­
tain a report on all of the petitions
which are now in circulation. A
number of the large corporations
which have not yet signed have signi­
fied their willingness to do so as soon
as a petition can be presented to the
proper officers.
Where Petitions Can Be Signed.
Petitions are open for the signa­
tures of affected property-holders at
the following places: First National
bank, Bismarck bank, Lahr Motor Co.,
F. L. Conklin's, Orris W. Roberts', A.
P. Lenhart's, City National hank, Hos­
kins', French & Welch's, G. C. Wach
ter's. Commercial club, Grand Pacific
hotel.
Any member of the Commercial
club streets committee—W. E. Lahr,
Carl Pedersen and G. C. Wachter—
will gladly accommodate property
holders desiring to help the good
work along.
There is no longer any question as
to the success of this project, the big­
gest', the most vital and the most
pregnant with promise, which Bis­
marck ever has undertaken. If every­
one who is interested pitches in and
helps, the work will be completed this
week, and the petitions will go to the
city commission at its next meeting.
If sufficient help is not' forthcoming,
the comparatively few men who have
been doing the work to date will be
compelled to work so much the hard­
er.
What Commission Will Oo.
The commission is committed to a
paving plan. Upon the receipt of the
petition, the commission will assume
charge of the detail work which to
date has been handled by the Com­
mercial club committees. The paving
district will be established prelimin­
ary work necessary will be ordered
done, and then bids will be advertised
for, as required by law. Paving is
one item of public improvement in
which the property-owners have every
thing to say. If they wish to pave
their streets with twenty-dollar gold
pieces, there is none to say them nay.
If they prefer a cheaper, perhaps
more durable material, "it is up to
them."
Bids probably will be called for on
the following five materials, whose
approximate price per square yard is
also given: Vitrified brick, $2.75
creosotecl blocks, $2.65 bitulithic,
$2.20: bituminous concrete, $2.00
concrete, $1.75.
Easy to Investigate.
Bismarck property holders need not
go outside the state to determine the
relative value of these several types
of paving. Mandan, Minot, Grand
Forks and Fargo have on exhibition
samples of these various materials
which have been in service a number
years. The main street in Mandan is
paved with bitulithic. Brick and ore
osoted block have been usefl in bofh
Fargo and Grand Forks, as have sand­
stone, bitulithic, bituminous concrete
and plain concrete.

CEK. SCOTT
CONCLUDES HIS
Has Gone Over All Reports With
Funston and Is Informed of
Conditions.
MORE TROOPS CROSS
INTERNATIONAL LINE
Sail Antonio, April 22.—Major Gen­
eral Hugh L. Scott had practically
concluded late today the mission on
which he was sent here by the secre­
tary of war and departmental head­
quarters. It was said he probably
would leave tomorrow for Washing­
ton.
Since his arrival here last night,
Gen. Scott' has been with Gen. Funs
ton almost constantly. Together they
have read such reports as came from
the base at Columbus, from officers
along the lines of communication, and
from Gen. Pershing. None of these
indicated fresh activity by the Amer­
ican troops, but preparation for attack
was indicated and Gen. Scott gained
at first-hand an idea of the defensive
attitude the punitive expedition has
assumed.
Comprehensive Report.
General Scott explained that the
secretary had sent him here for a
more comprehensive report of the sit­
uation than it had been possible to
receive over the telegraph wires, and
that the minute his work was com­
pleted he would leave for Washington.
As to the conclusion he had reached
and the nature of the report he would
make he was non-commital. He was
asked if it had been decided to with­
draw the troops and replied:
"We have not reached a conclu­
sion." He nodded his head toward
Gen. Funston, when he said "we."
More "^roops for Mexico.
The crossing of additional Ameri­
can troops into Mexico from •Colum­
bus today caused a feeling approach­
ing dismay among Mexican officials
in Juarez, who were previously con­
vinced that Gen. Pershing's expedi­
tion was on the point of withdrawal.
Gen. Gavira, the Juarez commander,
was frank in his expressions of con­
cern.
"The additional troops sent into
Mexico may be merely intended as a
guard for our communication in the
event of withdrawal," is the explana­
tion offered by one officer.
There is little question that officers
here genreally believe withdrawal is
probable.. Some of them have .virtu­
ally expressed the opinion that Gen.
Pershing has already taken the pre­
liminary step in the concentration of
his columns at three or four points,
a move which will enable him to evac­
uate the more dangerous points of oc­
cupation with a minimum of delay af­
ter he receives his orders from Wash­
ington.
Renewed Anxiety.
Renewed anxiety was shown here
today over the grave condition in
Mexico, tiarranza money suffered an­
other decline today, being quoted in a

President and Cabinet May Reach
Decision Next Tucs
day.
NEED MORE TROOPS
TO CONTINUE PURSUIT
No Reason to Believe Adminis­
tration Has Changed
Viewpoint.
Washington, April 22.—A decision
as to whether troops will be with­
drawn from Mexico may be reached
«y President Wilson and his cabinet
'iuesday. This was indicated tonight
when it was reported from San An­
tonio that Major Gen. Scott, sent by
Secretary Baker* to investigate the
military problem* confronted by Gen.
Funston and his men, might be back
in Washington in time for his report
to be laid before the regular meeting
of the cabinet on that day.
Secretary Baker declined to discuss
the probable meaning of Gen. Scott's
decision to hasten back to the capital
without extending his quest for in­
formation beyond conferences with
Gen. Funston and his officers at the
department headquarters.
It is known, however, that Gen.
Funston feels that he cannot go far­
ther with the pursuit of Villa than lie
already has gone, unless he is heavily
reinforced and his hand freed, to
some extent' at least, with dealing
with problems of supply and informa­
tion beyond the border. Gen. Scott's
decision to return at once, generally,
was taken to mean the same conclu­
sion and would so report to Secretary
Baker.
In this connection, it is recalled
that President Wilson specifically re­
jected plans ra* a more extensive
movement in pursuit of Villa mapped
out by the general statf after the Col­
umbus raid.
There is no re*'W to believe that
the adtifiuiatwUu»fr has Changed 'ttff
viewpoint. If Gen. Scott recommends
that the expedition either be freed of
the restraints imposed by its friendly
nature and largely reinforced, or
withdrawn entirely, there seems little
doubt that the latter course will be
followed.
Military officials on the border ap­
parently take the same view of the
situation. They already have estimat­
ed, according to press dispatches,
that Gen. Pershing's men could be
brought out in ten days without being
exposed to serious danger of attack
enroute.
Secretary Baiter gave out' no dis
piach from the border today.

were present.
The first thing on the program was
to settle the terms of the various
members. Lots were drawn lo ascer­
tain who should serve the one year
terms. This fell to George Will the
two-year terms fell to C. B. Little and
C. L. Young, and the two three-year
terms fell tp Mrs. E. G. Patterson and
Otto Holta.
Elect Officers.
The members of the board then pro­
ceeded to elect officers for the ensu­
ing year: President, C. B. Little:
secretary, C. L. Young. A committee
was appointed by the chair to investi­
gate the building and site proposition.
Messrs. Holta and Will were placed
on this committee and will make its
report at the next meeting of the
board, which will probably be in the
course of the next two weeks.
Informally Discussed Plans.
The board informally'discussed the
site and building proposition and also
other matters pertinent' to the estab­
lishment of the new Carnegie library
in Bismarck. The matter will be more
fully taken up at tne next meeting,
which will be called by President
Little.

London, April 22.—Hard fighting
has been in progress in the Verdun
region and heavy forces have been
thrown into the battle on both sides,
but the changes of ground have not
been noticeably great.
The struggle seems to have been
most intense in the reigion of Dead
Man's hill, northwest of the fortress,
where French and Germans have tak­
en turns in launching offenses.
Neither side claims sains as a re­
sult. Paris admits that the Germans
secured a foothold in some of the
new French trenches, but declares
the ground previously lost was after­
ward all regained.
Berlin Concedes French Gain.
E'erlin concedes a French gain in
the Caurettes Wood, just to the west
of the Meuse, where trenches have
frequently changed hands. Toward
the northern end of the western bat­
tle line, the British have succeeded
in regaining a part of the ground re­
cently lost to the north of Ypres,
their attack resulting in the recap­
ture of about 200 yards of the GU9
yards captured by the Germans on
April 19.
The Russian troops which landed
at Marseilles on Thursday are al­
ready on their way north, presumably
to the fighting front, passing through
the city of Lyons on Saturday. They
were given an enthusiastic greeting
all along the route.
War in East Africa.
The British campaign against G«r
man East Africa i-s 1wtn£ vigorowrfy
waged and with General Smutz in
command, has reported the occupa­
tion of Guemettz and Salanga, which
places the advance of the expedi­
tionary forces some 10U miles inside
the border of the German colony.
The Turkish account of the battle
of April 17 oh the Tigris declares
the British were defeated with loss
of more than 4,000 in killed and
wounded.
Turks Defeat English.
The Turks captured the positions
previously taken by the British, with
the capture of a few guns and some
prisoners. A subsequent attack on
April 19 was repulsed.
Constantinople reports a flight of
200 miles over the desert by a Turk­
ish aeroplane, which successful'/
bombarded a British camp at El Ka
nara on the Suez canal and returned
safely. The American note to Ger­
many has been sent to army head­
quarters, where it is in the hands of
Emperor William and Chancellor von
Betiimann-Hollwegg, and the chief of
the general staff. The note was print­
ed in the afternoon papers of Sat­
urday.
The casualty list shows that the
British lost 372 killed, G90 wounded,
and 44 missing in March, a total of
1,1(M. The losses in officers since
the commencing of hostilities total
25,033'. Of these 7,792 were lulled, or
died of wounds, 15.438 were wound­
ed, and 1,803 are missing.
A Norwegian bark (name not giv­
en), says an Exchange Telegraph Co.
dispatch, was sunk by a German sub­
marine. The crew was landed.
(Helena, 'Mont., April 22.—Returns

ed States Senator Cummins was lead­
ing Col. Iloosevelt, whose name was
written on the republican ballot by
voters, by a slightly decreased mar­
gin. President Wiilson, who was un­
opposed, continued to poll about twice
the vote cast for the republican can­
didates.
It may be three days before the
entire vote can be tabulated, as many
precincts are far from the railroad.
The vote in the state was 13 per
cent of the total register.

One Captured by Sheriff's Posse
Others Are Still at
Large.
Kankakee, 111., April 22.—Six pris­
oners, charged with felonous crimes,
participated in a daring jail delivery
here tonight, at G:4."» o'clock, and five
of them succeeded in eluding a large
posse, headed by Sheriff BothfUr,
which started shortly afterward in
pursuit.
Alfred Hunter, a Tiegro, awaiting
trial on a charge of attempted mur­
der, was captured shortly before ten
o'clock. The prisoners, who included
Gus Penman, Jesse Brown, Joseph
Burns, Frank Miller, Charles Johnson
and Hunter, effected their escape by
digging through three layers of a
brick wall with a steel slat from one
of the bunks in the cell. The sheriff
was at dinner at the time and knew
nothing of the escape until notified
by a woman "trusty," who heard the
noise of the prisoners getting out and
saw them crawling through the aper­
ture in the prison wall. The jail was
occupied in another section of the
prison at the time. Penman, who is
supposed to have led the prisoners,
was convicted in Champaign county
of murdering his chum, Harold Shaw,
and was convicted to life imprison­
ment. but was granted a new trial by
the supreme court. Taking a change
of venue, he was brought to this city
for a second trial, which was to have
begun on May 21. Both Penman and
his victim are said to be members of
wealthy families in Champaign coun­
ty. At a late hour tonight nothing
had been learned of the five prison­
ers who are at liberty.

versy.
WASHINGTON IS IN
STATE OF SU8PEN8E
Officials Confident That Crisis
Will Be Passed by This
Week.
Washington, April 22.—The United
States government has made tentfe
tive plans to cope with every conceiv­
able situatoin which would result
from the severance of diplomatic re­
lations with Germany. For reasons
they indicated were obvious, officials
tonight deemed it unwise to discuss
the details.
There is reason for believing, how­
ever, that some of the plans have to
do with the safety of American citi­
zens in the German empire, and that
others have to do with American sup­
ervision of German interests in the
countries at war with Germany,
Confidential Dispatches.
Numerous dispatches on these sub­
jects are understood to have been
sent to diplomatic representatives
abroad, particularly to Ambassador
Gerard at Berlin. The dispatches are
regarded as being highly confidential,
and for that reason, information con­
cerning, them is- unayailablo
.bore.
Among dispafches received from'
Ambassador Girard '¥f!hin thfe past
two days was one describing the man­
ner in which the American note, de­
claring the purpose of the United
States to break relations unless Ger­
many modifies her submarine meth­
ods, was received by German officials.
It is understood the ambassador re­
ported German officials as being
greatly surprised at the demands of
the American government. Mr. Ger­
ard is said to have gathered, at least,
an impression that the foreign office
had no idea that the communication
would be as drastic or as final as it
was.
Not Optimistic.
The general feeling here tonight,
apparently, was not at all optimistic
regarding the outcome. In the ab­
sence of further information regard­
ing advices from Ambassador Gerard,
the day's press dispatches were read
closely. There were indications in
them that there might be dealings or
request for additional information. It
is well understood, however, that the
United States, under no consideration,
will, permit delays and discussion, un­
less it' is preceded by a declaration
from Germany that she has so modi­
fied her submarine warfare as to
bring it within the scope of interna­
tional law.
Officials Confident.
In the meantime, the situation in
Washington remains one of tense ex­
pectancy. Officials are confident that
before this time next week, the issue
will have been settled: that the Unit­
ed States will feel certain tbe safety
of innocent non-combatants on the
high seas is assured, or steps for a
diplomatic break will have been tak­
en.
Among the foreign diplomats here,
the effect of a break between the
United States and Germany Is a topic
of wide interest.
In regard to Austria, however,
much is considered to depend upon
the answer made by the Vienna gov­
ernment to the American inquiry re­
garding the attack on the Russian
bark Imperator, carrying two Ameri­
can citizens, one of whom was Injured
by shrapnel fire. Ambassador Pen
field was directed to make the Inquiry
early this week.
CALLS ON VON JAGOW.
Berlin, April 22.—James W. Gerard,
the American Ambassador, called on
Foreign Minister von Jagow this eve­
ning and was closeted with him for al­
most an hour. Their discussion was
of an informative nature. Imperial
Chancellor von Bethmann HolHrefg
will return to Berlin tomorrow (Sun­
day) morning, but a reply to tke

for several days, possibly not before
Wednesday.
