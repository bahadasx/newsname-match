LAST RECOORSE OF
i
EMNED
MEXICANS
PHOENIX. April .'2.-The last re
' course, short of the exercise of clem
ency by the board of pardons and pa
roles, in beli'if of tiir lour condemned
, Mexican;, was excercised when the
firm of Struckmeyer and Jenckts filed
in the state supreme court a motion
for a rehearing '
1 The motion addresses itself to the
recent ruling of the supreme court in
den)ing a habeas corpus writ, which
1 was sued out last year, when the
j. Mexicans ,tood wllhin ,he vrry 5hadow
of the gallows.
The effect of the motion for rehear-
ing is to stay the sending out of the
mandate of the supreme court until
ihe motion is passed upon. If the
motion is overruled the sole earthly
hope remauiing to the coad-nined men
will be -an appeal for clemency to the
board of pardons and parole.

BUENA. April 21. An eent of
I
very
great importance which took
place at Vuena on Sunday afternoon
1 April 19-h. was the laying of t'le corn
' er stone of a new Meth'Mltst church.
TK' servic. was conducted by Dr. A.
W. Adkiiisiui Superintendent of the
M E church in AnzonJ. and the
pastor of the church. Rev Trevor I
Orion, assisted b) a fine choir and a ,
fine company of people.
The erection of this building, an
adobe 20 x 40 feet for a new commun
ity the oldest settlers who have been
here only a little mote than three
years, is decidedly ambitious under-
taking. It was made possible in the
'ginning by the genorous donation
from Mr. J H Downer of a block of
ground 300 x 300 fee' square. The
I pastor has been tireless in bis efforts
' to push the work, and has labored
' with his own hands together with pub
lic spirited citizens in putting in tilt
foundation. i
It would be impossible to personally
recognize the work of ercry one. but
deserving especial menti'jii ts Mrs. II.
A. Waite By ber strong personalty
I and skillful teaching of tbc adult
bible class, she has left an indelible
impress on the community
The work of building will lie push t
just as rapidly as funds can be secured.
The community is thoroughly united.

ferences must be sunk in the larger I
interest of the spiritual upbuilding of I
the community.
This will be the first church erected
in this valley. The nearest church
being at Tombstone, Hi miles away
No doubt Sunday April 16th will go
do.vn in the history of Buena as a red
letter day. It stamps the communitv
as aggressive, believing in the best
things, and will be a very great at
traction to the best class of settlers.
