Politicians See Move to

The campaign ?op from the Wilson
Ada lalatratiafl to Tammany Hall in
the appointment yesterday of Senator
Robert F, Wagner as I'ostmaster of
New York came tno 'ate. Senator
Wapner irrevocahly rr>fu?ed the offir*.
It was the frrst federal rlaee that
ir IdeBt Wilson had seen fit to offer.
ar.d Tammany rrfuses to be placatcd
at this late hour by a place of such
small porttiral significance.
In fact, it ifl known that the local
Democratic organization is opposed to
any partrcularly conspicuous Tam?
many man taking the postmasterrhip.
The Presidenr could not have selerted
a more conspicuou* one. The patron
aaja al 'he office is practically flU, as
?here are only two or three exempt
places open for appointments, and the

cKlled ou Senator Wagner and told
him that the President wanted him to
rcconsider his refusad of the post
raaaterahlp. Senator Wagner agam
taid that ba eaaW not accept the
appointment.
Surprise for Wagner.
When he ]earn*d yesterday that his
name had been sent to the Senate,
Senator Wagner said:
"I am greatly surpnsed, and it is
iaapaaaibla for me to accept. Whilo
I appretiate the appointment as a
?rraat compliment, the place is entirely
o,it>ide of the lines of my ambitions.
I have enjoyeii the turmoil of legisla
tive give and take and the chance to
aaalat in putting through important
legislation. BBd the administration of
purely routine affairs. though^ lmpor
tant. xvoulil not appeal to me."
The sending of Ser.ator Wagner's
name to thr Senate, oxrr his protest,
eraatad two distinct impressions yes
lerday among Tammany men. First, t
apaaarad that Presiilent Wilson wished
tn make it appr-ar that le was offering
Tammanv a "big job." and, aecond,
that Ifl handing it to a prominent Tam?
many man of German descent he was
making a play for the German vote.

Captain Tur.ney said the reason the

was to keep Newton ignorant of their

"How do you propose to murder Mor?

"In one of two ways," Newton U al?

CHIEF OF GERMAN STAFF
CONSULTED ON ANSWER
WASHINGTON MAKES FULL PLANS
TO MEET BREAK WITH GERMANY
Washington, April 22,-The United States government has made
tentative plans to cope with every conceivable situation which would
result from the severance of diplomatic relations with Germany. l"or
reasons they said were obvious. officials to-night deemed it unwise to
discuss the details.
There is reason for believing, however, that some of the plans have
to do with the safety of American citizens in the German Empire, and
that others have to do with American supervision of German interests
in the countries at war with Germany.
Numeroua dispatches on these subjects are understood to have
been sent to diplomatic representarives abroad, particularly to Am
bassador Gerard at Berlin.
Danger of Break Seen

Gerard's Messages Are Discouraging?Washington Ex
pect?< to Learn Nature of Reply Early This
Vv'eek?Relations with Vienna in Balance.
I From Tt.e TrtSu'.e Pmttm 1
Washington. April 22. Reports of an
unyielding attitude in Berlin have
caiised the belief here that an immedi
ate breal with Germany wi'.l follow
the German reply. expected here in
about a week. Di*patches from Am
baaaadai Gerard, giving his view of the
situation, are closely guarded by Presi
! dent Wilson and Secretary I.ansing.but
there are indieations that Mr. gerard ia
| not bopeful of . ..tisf.ctory reply to
i the President's d.mands.
I Administration official. decline to
I forecast developments further than to
i say that President Wilson will break
! reiations aa readily on the basis of an
i unsatisfactory note as on the actual
.inking of . ship. Aa they aee it, thc
issue ia elean cut, and there can be no
compromise, no "substantially" satis
factory promises. Kither Germany
must agree to stop illegal sea w.r or
Ambassador Bernstorff must go.
Among dispatches received from Am?
bassador Gerard within the last two
davs was. one describing the manner in
which the American note was received
! by German officials.
While this was held a* confidential, it
is understood the amb.asador repre
sented Berlin officials as being greatly
Rurprised at the demands of the Wash?
ington goxernment. Mr. Gerard is aaid
to have gathered at least an impression
that the Foreign Office had no idea that
the communication would be as drastic
and final as it was.
Problem for Berlin.
Administration officials believe the
principal problem of the German For?
eign Office is to frame a reply that
will sat.sfv the United States and at
tho same time give the impression in
Germanv that no real eoncessions are
being made. It is e^pected. therefore.
that if Germany compUes with the
