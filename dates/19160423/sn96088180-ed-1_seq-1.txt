Series el Train Robberies
Believed to Have Been
Staged by Gentlemanly Jail
Breaker From Grants Pass
Portland, April 21. The robber
who ha perpetrated a aeries of bold
train hold-ups In Wyoming Is none
other than John Austin Hooper, po
llen and special agents In Portland
believe today.
Hooper Is regarded among officers
as the "bent" hold-up man at large
In the country today.
The methods of the Wyoming train
robber are similar to those of Hoop
er, who was held responsible for a
erlea of daring robberies In north
ern California, southern Oregon and
the vicinity of Portland.
Hooper Is 34 years old, 5 feet 10 H
Inches tall, has dark curly hair, gray
brown eyes, a pug nose, and usually
wears (lasses. He weighed 163
pounds when he was In the custody
of officers here about a year ago.
He Is well educated, affable, and In
Ills western robberies .has usually
talked freely to his victims white he
foroed somebody to pass the hst.
After seven or eight' robberies In
Oregon, Hooper was arrested In The
Dalles last June. He was ..brought
to Portland, where It was determined
to turn him over to the sheriff of
Josephine county to be prosecuted
for the robbery of the 0 rants Psss
railroad station.
Hooper remained In jail at Grants
Pass but a short time. With the aid
of another prisoner he disarmed
Sheriff Will Smith and escaped. Sev
eral months later he was arrested In
Milwaukee, Wis., but by putting up
ft strong plea he succeeded In freeing
hlmseir before the police there were
fully aware of his Identity. He has
not been heard of since then.
The remarkable similarity of hi
methods and those of the Wyoming
tmjln robber leads railroad detec
tives to believe It was Hooper who
beld up the Union Pacific train near
Rawllna, Wyo., last night.
Descriptions and photographs of
Hooper hare been sent to Wyoming.
No description of the Wyoming rob
ber hsa been received here.

PREDICT WAR
, Washington. April 22, "If the
United States escapes war with a
great power in the next five years,
It will be a triumph of diplomacy.
It won't be such a war as we had with

HB10FU.S.
Washington, April 22. Little hope
that Germany would meet fully the
American submarine demands was
apparent here today.
The interview which Carl W. Ack-
erman, United Press staff correspon
dent obtained with Admiral von Holt
zendorff furnished the state depart
ment with Its first definite line on
the German attitude.
Some officials concluded that modi
fication of Wilson's demaada would
be the only chance of Avoiding a
break and modification is out of the
question, they aald.
The Administration Is leaving Ger
many to decide whether she can con
duct ber submarine operations ef
fectively without violating interna
tional law. Secretary Lansing teela
that If German submarine command
ers visit and search vessels before
attacking them, and assure the safety
of passengers on doomed ships, the
campaign will be robbed of Us des
tructlveness, and bence of Its ef
fectiveness.
If Germany agrees" to follow the
visit, search and safety of passen
gers provisions, America may accept
her assurances, but Germany mast
adhere to its pledges. The problem
then Is:
Will Germany abandon her pre
sent method of submaring which
must be the first step toward a policy
healing strained relations with the
United States.
The authorities feel that Admiral
von Holtiendorff in the Ackerman In
terview-'Indicated Germany's unwil
lingness to meet the demands,but
desired to shift responsibility for a
possible break to America. .

Washington, "Aprll 22. The ' -Ger
man embassy expects to receive to
day or tomorrow instructions from
Berlin with regard to additional rep
resentations concerning the arrest of
Wolf von Igel, former secretary to
Captain Frani vonPapen, embassy
attache,' and solsure - of ' his papers
by United States secret service
agents. , . .
The embassy intimated that this
situation is so, serious that it may
perhaps warrant Germany recalling
Ambassador von Bernstorff. Ger
many, it was hinted, would at least
ask ft formal apology from the state
department.
The papers seized from von Igel
arrived at Washington today. No
photographto copies of them were
surrendered, however. Later the
United States marshal refused to give
up without a speclfio order to return
all evidence In the case. No such
order has been Issued yet.
