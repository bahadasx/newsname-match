It Plainly Tells First Chief
AMERICAN TROOPS WILL HOT
II .'KM MAINTAIN
Washington, June 20. The Ameri
can note was handed to Eliseo Arre-
dondo, Mexican ambassador designate
this morning. It flatly rejects Car
jranza's demand for the withdrawa
of United States troops from Mexico
CARRANZA REBUKED
The note rebukes the Carranza gov
ernment for the discourteous tone and
temper of its last communication.
LONG LIST OF OUTRAGES
The long continued outrages
against American citizens are taken
up and reviewed.
TROOPS WILL STAY
The note declares the American
troops will be kept in Mexico unti
the de facto government performs
its duty of pursuing bandits who
ought to be arrested and punished by
tne Mexican government. ,
IF THIS MEANS WAR, MAKE
THE WORST OF IT
The communication concludes with
the statement that if the de facto
government continues to ignore this
obligation and carries out its threat
to appeal to arms against the Amer
ican troops, the gravest consequences
will follow.
"While this government would
deeply regret such a result," says the
note, "it cannot recede from the set
tied determination to maintain its na
tional rights and perform its full duty
in preventing a further invasion of
the territory of the United States
and in removing the peril which
American residents along the inter
national border have borne so long
with patience and forbearance."
... -;
RECOUNTING BORDER RAIDS
The note recounts several typical
border raids declaring that Carranza
adherents and even Carranza soldiers
took part in looting, burning and kill
ing.
Requests that Carranza stop the
laids failed to bring results. The ban
dits enjoyed the freedom of the towns.
They even received, according to ad
vices, protection, encouragement and
aid from the de facto government.
EVEN VILLA GOT BY
Villa, after the Columbus raid, pass
cd within sight of Casas Grandes, and
the Carranza garrison didn't try to
stop him. '
AMERICA HAD NO CHOICE
In face of these depredations, says
the note, the perpetrators of which
Carranza was unable or possibly con
sidered inadvisable to apprehend and
punish the United States had no other
recourse than to employ force to dis
perse the bandits.
CARRANZA A STICKLER
The necessity for immediate action
caused American troops to cross the
border without permission. Carranza
the note says, has given more atten
tion to the form of the agreement than
obtaining any practical object.
INEVITABLE CONCLUSION
The- disposition of Mexican troops
to stop raids promised by Obregon
has not been carried out. The con
clusion is reluctantly reached that the
jde facto government didn't and does
ot now. intend or desire these out-
aws to be captured or destroyed.
AMERICA MADE NO PROMISE
The. cause and objects attained by
he puntive expeditions are recount
ed. Denial is made that promises
vere ever made that no more troops
Krould cross the border.

Said Carranza is Trying to Restrain
a Bunch of Impetuous
Greasers
(Associated Press)
Mexico City, June 18 (Delayed).
General Carranza, addressing a mass
meeting in front of his residence to
night, urged the citizens to refrain '
trom hostile acts against Americans
and declared that he had hopes of
peacefully arranging the difficulties
between Mexico and the United
States.
The first chief said in part:
"This is not the time for hasty
action. I am trying to arrange our
difficulties with the United States
peacefully and have hopes of succeed
ing. I want you to aid me.
"The encounter between American
soldiers and Mexicans near Mata-
moros has been temporarily solved
with the withdrawal taken up diplo
matically." There was some trouble in
Mazatlan caused by the intrusion of
American sailors and that has also
been adjusted for the time being.
Go to your homes and be good
Mexicans, remembering also that I
will do my utmost to preserve the dig
nity of the Mexican nation. If we -are
forced to resort to arms I will lead

A crowd composed of several thou
sand people cheered the remarks of
the rst chief. Early in the evening a
big demonstration had been made in
front of the national palace and after
wards the demonstrators had paraded
through the principal streets of the
city. The metropolis is perfectly calm
ate tonight and General Carranza's
words are expected to have a good
effect in maintaining this condition.

UNTIL DE FACTO GOVERNMENT
E THE WORST OP IT
T AT A MEET-
At an informal meeting Monday
night of a number of representative
men' from the city and county plans
were discussed for the proposed bond
issue for permanent roads. The con
sensus of opinion was that the senti
ment of the people of the county
should first be sounded, and that, the
sentiment being favorable, an elec
tion should be called by the county
commissioners. With an election call
ed, t le plan is to give the people
some iling defienite ; to vote - upon.
Figures will be prepared to show just
what effect the- bond issue will have
on taxes, it being believed that the
issue will bring about no increase in
taxes, but rather tend to decrease
them. A competent engineer .will be
employed .to prepare specifications
and supervise construction. Every
section of the county will be provided
with a road. Bids will be called for,
and the - contracts ' for construction
awarded subject to the vote of the
people. The people will know, there
fore, just how the bond money will
be spent, where it will be spent, and
under whose direction, and will be
able to vote accordingly.
A committee consisting of L. W.
Duval, Jake Brown and D. E. Mclver
will appear before the Marion qounty
democratic executive committee when
it meets in Ocala on Saturday, June
24, and will ask the committeeman
from each precinct to arrange for a
meeting of the people in that precinct
for the purpose of getting at the
sentiment with regard to the proposed
bonds. Each precinct will be asked
to send three delegates to a meeting
in Ocala about the middle of Jul v.
instructed to express themselves for
or against bonds; the people of the
precinct having in the meantime
been supplied with figures showing
how the taxes will be affected, and
with a map showing proposed roads.
A dinner, or barbecue, will be given
the delegates sent tothe meeting in
this city, which will be held at the
fair grounds. At the meeting the
sentiment of the county will be de
termined, the precincts will have ex
pressed themselves as to what road3
they would want, and, if the vote of
the delegates is favorable the county
commissioners will at once meet in
special session and call an election,
and select an engineer to prepare
specifications.
It is thought that it would take an
engineer about 'five months to nre
pare the specifications, and this would
necessitate having an election sortie
time during the early part of next
year. . - : . . ' .
W. D. Cam, chairman of the county
commissioners, and D. C. Stiles Jr.,
an expert accountant, will pre'pare
the hgures showing the effect on the
taxes, and have prepared a large map
ol proposed roads.
The plan which those meeting last
night thought would be the best to
adopt is the plan just used in- Polk
county so successfully, where the peo
ple voted overwhelmingly for a bond
issue of $1,500,000.
It is thought that it will take an
issue of about $950,000 to give Mar
ion county a permanent road in each
section. The exact amount; of the is-,
sue will be determined by the figures
of the engineer on the cost of the
roads to be built.
