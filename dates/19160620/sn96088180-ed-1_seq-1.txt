FAKE REPORTS
E
Laredo, Texas. June 20. Wild
rumors are being circulated In Mex
ico, tending further to lower Amer
ican prestige and correspondingly to
fan 'Mexican patriotism.
A newspaper circulated In Nuevo
Laredo states that Oeneral Trevlno
In ordering Oeneral Pershing from
the country .specified that the Amer
ican commander should leave all his
munitions, motor trucks and artil
lery, or Trevlno's forces would de
stroy the expedition.
To this, according to the news
paper, Pershing readily agreed.
A rumor Is current In Nuevo Lare
do to the effect that War Minister
Obregon hss kidnaped Oeneral Car
ransa and Is deporting him to Ha
vana,, This report was received with
crest enthuslssm oy the Mexican
population, as Carrenxa's popularity
hss been on the wane for some time,
while Obregon is the national Idol.
Mexicans arriving here from Mon

soldiers are encamped between Nuevo
Laredo and Alto, awaiting orders to

TO
ATTACK OEL RIO
San Antonio, June 20. Interest tn
the border situation early today cen
tered on Del Rio, directly west of
here on the iRlo Grande, where It Is
reported that 1.500 Mexicans and
Ysqui Indians are approaching the
city from the south. Reports of the
advance were brought to Del Rio by
Mexicans and transmitted to General
Funston by Colonel Sibley, command
ing at that place.
General Greene, commanding the
Eagle Pass patrol district, sent a bat
talion of the Third Infantry on motor
trucks to .Del Rio immediately upon
receipt of the information. Sibley's
command la of fair strength and with
the reinforcements he should be able
to defend the city against the Mexi

Cairanza Told Tlt Troops
Are to Be Retard Below
Border, and "Gravest Con
sequences" Threatened
-Washington, June 20. The Amer
ican, government today threatened
General Carranxa with "the gravest
consequences" it he attacks United
States troops now in Mexico.
This threat was contained in a
long note replying to his last with
drawal demand. Full of short-arm
diplomatic jabs, the note positively
declined to Uke the United 8tates
forces out of Mexico.' It excoriated
Carransa for his failure to co-operate
and resented his bruskness and his
Intimations of bad faith.
"The de facto ' government is
pleased to Ignore this obligation (to
protect American rights od chase
bandits)" ssld the note, "and to be
lieve that. In case of a refusal to re
tire these troops there Is no further
recourse than to defend Ua territory
by an appeal to arms, for the govern
ment of the United States would
surely be lacking In alncerlty and
friendship If It "djd not frankly Im
press upon the de fscto government
that the execution of his threat will
lead to the graves! consequences."
Bluntly the note told Carransa that
this government "can not recede from
Its settled determination to maintain
Its national rights'.' and to prevent
further raids across the boundary.
The high lights In the note were:
Resentment of Carranza'a dis
courteous tone and temper in his last
note.
Charges that bandits have gone un
hampered and unpunished in attack
ing Americans.
Recitation of scores of Instances
of bsndltry.
Charges that the Carranxa regime
had been Indifferent to atrocities snd
even encouraged and aided some of
the leaders of these.
Charges that Carranxa did not take
proper steps to apprehend Villa and
others.
Lansing takes up In detail Car-
ranza's last demands. Charges that
this government had not fully an
swered a previous communication are
flatly denied. Several misstatements.
noticeably a quotation carried In the
Carranza communication and pur
porting to show this government had
formally admitted that the dispersion
of the Villa band had been accom
plished, are cited.
Mention Is made of the Mexican
government's suggestion that Ameri
can troops Be withdrawn on the
ground that Carranza forces are now
so disposed as to prevent outlawry
snd border raiding.
it. was because of these sugges
tions and General Scott's confidence
they would be carried out," says the
noto. "that he stated In his mem
orandum, following the conference
with General Obregon, that American
forces would be gradually withdrawn.
It Is to he noted that while the United
States government was willing to
agree to this plan, the Carranza gov
ernment refused to do so.'
General Carranza Is reminded that
even while the 'border conference was
on at El Paso and after American
conferees had been assured Carranxa
troops were able to .protect the bor
der, the attack at Glenn Springs oc
curred. Charges In Carranza'a note to this
government regarding Influences In
the United States , that have sought
to bring about Intervention are an
swered by dtatlon of Inflammatory
