80,000 COSHERED
BY RUSSlAEiS
Fetreating Austrians Are Cut off
In Bukowina
RUSSIANS SUCCESS GROWING
Austrian Forces Have Retired 25 Miles
and Must Make Stand Soon or
Lose Line.
Petrograd, June 20. An Austrian
nriny of 80,000 men has been cut off in
eastern Bukowina and it is believed
that it cannot rejoin the main Aus
trian forces.
All efforts of the Austrians to stem
the rapid Russian advance have failed
and the Russian forces are hourly tak
ing large numbers of prisoners, guns
and supplies.
Tetrograd, Juno 19. With an aver
age Austrian retirement of twenty-five
miles over the entire Volhynian and
Galaclan front, except in the immedi
ate region of Tarnopol; with the Rus
sian seizure of Czemowitz and the
flight of the southern Austrian Army
toward the Carpathians, and with the
Russians closing in upon Lemberg from
two directions, the operations on the
southwestern front have reached the
crucial point where, it is believed here,
the Austrian armies must either make
a final stand, or by their further re
treat automatically compel a general
retirement of the German army from
positions which they have held against
the Russians for nearly a year.
Such a stand, in the unanimous opin
ion of military oflicials here, will be an
impossibility, as the separated Aus
trian armies are unable to communi
cate with one another, and, all avail
able troops and reserves having been
called up, a quick rehabilitation of the
crinnled armies of the Austrians is
manifestly unlikely.
The prevailing confidence in the
speedy consummation of a Russian tri
umph over Austria is reflected in all
the comments of the newspapers. The
Petrograd Gazette says: "The thought
we have all lived with since the begin
ning of the war a final victory over
Austria is now at hand. Soon the
last notes of the swan song of tho
Dual Monarchy will be heard."
REOPEN DORSET QUARRIES
Development Begun on Kent &
Root
Property Idle 25 Years.
Rutland, June 18. A real estate deal
has just been completed which will
mean the redevelopment of another
of the many marble industries in the
Dorset range which have been aban
doned for 23 years. Three or four
such deals have been put through
within two years and the region, which
of late years has had only one or two
isolated plants, is again becoming a
marble center.
P. F. McCormack, one of the heads
of the Clarendon Marble company of
West Rutland, has bought the Kent fc
Root property of 60 acres at South
Dorset. Through it runs a vein of light
variegated stone. There is an old dam
on a branch of the Battenkill river
which runs through the site and Mr
McCoimack is Installing a water wheel
and generator, expecting to develop
water power. He will begin soon tak
ing blocks from the quarry which nits
been unusued for a quarter of a cen
tury. The tract cost approximately
$20,000.
ADMITS HE WAS SCARED
And so It Every Other Soldier Said
Col. Hannon at Brotherhood Meeting
Col. Thos. Hannon, veteran of the
civil war and head of the soldiers'
liome here gave some interesting war
reminiscences last evening before the
Brotherhood of the Methodist church
The occasion was tho regular Hem!
monthly meeting of tho Brotherhood
About 35 members were present to
hear the Colonel's talk.
Col. Hannon participated in tho bat
tlo of Chambers Farm, ono of tho
toughest fights before Richmond
when 4500 men were slain, lie was in
the thick of the fighting and knows
something of whut real war means,
Tho colonel was asked for a descrlp
tion of his Bcnsatlons on going Into
action. The questioner wished
know if tho average soldier Is badly
frightened in battle.
"You bet wo were frightened," Col
Hannon replied. "So Is every soldier
who comes fnco to face with tin:
enemy's guns. Whenever 1 meet
soldier who says ho went Into battle
without being scared out of his wits
1 attribute It to ono of two things
Either ho handles the truth with n cc
tain shyness or he wasn't there!"

STORE BROKEN INTO
u. tjtfe "ey Taken But Cash Register
Ca - is Ruined.
Cash to i. -nt of $5 and a cash
register valued JO was the loss
sustained by K. 1. ,louran about one
o'clock this morning when thieves
broke into his Mill street store, lifted
the cash register through a rear win
dow and broke it open in an adjacent
lot. A small amount of cigars und
cigarettes was also taken.
One of the tenants of the building
sat in his room smoking until an early
hour and heard peculiar sounds in the
rear of the llouran store beneath. He
did not investigate, thinking it either
the proprietor working late, or boys
in the rear yard. On opening the store
this morning, however, it was found
that a rear window had been removed,
the cash register pried from Its place.
That it was not the work of boys is
deduced from the weight of the ma
chine. Only a strong man could have
lifted the big register and handed it
through the window. The police are in
dined to believe that it was someone
who resides in the neighborhood nnd
had a knowledge of the layout of tho
store. Several small breaks have been
reported by Mr .llouran lately but they
appeared the work of mischievous
boys and small attention was paid to
tUc in. Last week an entrance was
gained through the ellar and small
amounts of goods pilfered. The police
do not believe the burglar who attempt
ed an entrance into Miss llattie Twit
c hell's home on Pleasant street the
night before had anything to do with
this break.

WITH IRVEIOUS
RAPIDITY
Vermont Companies Will Have
Ranks Well Filled

Equipment Seems Ample and Condi
tions far Superior to Those In
Spanish War.
Nearly every company of Ver
mont's infantry regiment last night
had its minimum quota of 05 men in
readiness to go to the mobilization
camp at Port Kthan Allen. Recruit
ing progressed rapidly yesterday and
will be continued until tae war
strength of 1'iOmen for each com
pany is reached. It was stated at
military headquarters in Montpelier,
last night that no company would
be allowed to go to camp until it had
at least til men.
The squadron of cavalry composed
of cadets from Norwich uimersity is
seeking luO more men in order to
till ui) its ranks to maximum war
stiength. Members of the graduat
ing class will be allowed to return to
college lor their diplomas. In the
ranks are members of the rifle team
whose remarkable shooting toward
the close of the recent intercollegiate
league season attracted widespread at
tention. The men will move on to Fort
Ethan Allen tomorrow morning. Lieut-
Col P. II. Thomas will be in charge
upon the arrival of the force in camp
during tho tempoiary absence of Col.
Ira B. Reeves, who is to be Installed
as president of Norwich university to

Washington, June P.). Virtually
every State called on by President W'il

ment is transacting business day and
night and its building is never closed,
but when the technical closing hour of

Baker had in his possession replies
from thirty-nine States.
Making allowance for the fact that
the National Guard organizations of

GOVERNOR URGING
Mil TO
CELEBRATE
This Year as 125th Year
Member of the Union
as
WOULD- CELEBRATE BY EFFORT
Plenty of Things That Can Be Done
To Increase the Prosperity of
Vermont.
Governor Gates has issued a special
proclamation urging tho people of Ver
mont to sit up and take notice that this
year is the 125th anniversary of the
admission of Vermont to the Union
Tho governor's proclamation is as fol
lows: To the People of the State of Vermont:
One hundred twenty. live years ago
Vermont was admitted into the Union
and became and remains an active and
forceful part of our great country. On
the battlefield, in the halls of Con
gress, in the field of invention, In com
mercial and Industrial activities, in all
branches of science, in agricultural
pursuits and in religious and civic ad
vancement, Vermont's century and a
quarter lias been productive of won
derful and wide-spread results. Her
people of today are possessed of a pro
digious and significant heritage and a
precession of advantages and environ
ment of which we may be justly proud
and thankful. She is rich in soil, weal
thy in minerals and possessed of
strong men and women.
It is fitting and right that we cele
brate the birth of our great State; tiiat
we commemorate the gallant deeds of
our noble men and women: and that
we unite in a resolve to remain true to
the trust which is ours in order that
the future of the State, may be assured
of a high and honorable place among
our sister States and in order that the
fourteenth star may remain bright and
untarnished on the Hag.
I therefore recommend that all our
peoplo co-operate In a general under
taking to make this one hundred
twenty-fifth anniversary a notable ami
memorable one in the history of the
State. May we not only enter heartily
into the celebration of our birth year
but may we prepare for a great future
for our commonwealth.
Let our deeds be a monument to this
anniversary
We can encourage and foster the de
velopment of our civic pride and muni
cipal consciousness.
We can co-operate with our boards
of trade and commercial clubs that In
dustrial activities increase and that
commercial growth become accclcrat
c:!. We can promote and elevate our
churches and schools that the purity
of diameter and nobleness of patrio
tism in our boys and girls may be as
sured.
We can improve our agricultural
opportunities and make homo life on
our farms more attractive and profit
able. We can unite in all the activities
that develop and round out a clean-cut
citizenship and an unquestioned pat
riotism, and we can transcend all little
jealousies and class prejudices In our
earnest endeavors to develop and
realize the Greater Vermont.
During the year there will be held
under the auspices of the Greater Ver
mont Association and other Civic and
Industrial societies several meetings
with especially prepared and appropri
ate programs. These meetings de
serve your hearty support and co-oper
ation. Let them indicate a strong
movement forward and a wholesome
support of true Americanism.
There will be special anniversary
sei vices held in our churches on Sun
day, July 2, next, and I urge special ef
fort on the part of the people to co
operate with their pastors in making
these services helpful and full of pat -
riotlc inspiration. I recommend that
the people generally attend these ser
vices and join in giving thanks to Al
mighty God for the commonwealth and
for what It has stood in the past one
hundred twenty-live years and for
what its future means to us as a
steadily progressing and patriotic
people.
It is expected that there will be a
general hoine-conilng and that Ver
monters from other states will visit
their native soil. Let us extend them
a welcome hand a welcome home
and let us make the stranger the
Hummer visitor fed the warmth of
good Vermont hospitality. Let each
one of us take some active part In
making this year count for Vermont.

Governor.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
What Ought Children to Be Taught in
School.
The reades of the Banner have
more than a passing interest in the bill
now in Congress relating to vocational
training. For one thing, a Vermonter
is on the committee and has the bill
In charge, Hon. Carroll S. Page. This
bill provides for assistance from the
Federal Government for vocational
schools throughout the country.
A great change has taken place in
the last few years in the popular es
timate of what an education should
consist of and of its purpose. Sen
sible people are asking if there is any
special object in a barber, a shoemaker
or a grocer becoming a Bcholar. Of
how grout value will cube root, or
Latin, or the theorems of geometry be
to the workman or the housewife in
real life. Yet nine-tenths of the pup
ils of our public schools are comprised
In thes number who will become one or
the other of the above classes.
Many earnest thinkers today are urg
Ing that play be made a part of the
regular routine of school duties. And
tliia is even a greater departure from
tradition than vocational education.
Yet there is no question that we shall
come to both in a few years. Those
who have studied the effects of or
ganized play on the character o! the
child realize that here Is the way to
teach self-confidence, energy and ilxi
ty of purpose. And who will gainsay
that these qualities are vastly more
essential to the character of a good
citizen than a knowledge of the loca
tion of all the cities of Asia or how to
obtain the greatest common divUor.
VERMONT AT CHICAGO
"Babbitt Rattles" Mere Feature of Big
Republican Pow-wow.
George II. Almon of Montpelier re
turned Tuesday night from Chicago,
where he attended the republican con
vention. Mr. Almon was ono of the
assistant sergeaiit-at-arins in the con
vention which gave him free access to
all of the auditorium and brought
him closely in toueh with the speak
ers. He said it was a wonderful gath
ering. The Vermont delegation headed by
T. N. Vail as chairman, w as prominent
from the first, for with Oregon they
were the first states to come out solid
ly for Hughes. At the end of the con
vention there was a great deal of
cheering for the Vermont delegation.
Again the delegation was featured
by the fact that no one could duplicate
thuir cheering for they used carnival
rattles furnished by F. II. Babbitt of
Bellows I-alls and which made a hit
with the convention.
The Vermont delegation stepped at
Sherman house where several of the
prominent men of the convention wero
located and therefore they were
brought closely in touch with Senators
Borah, Penrose, Lodge, Crane and
ether.
The delegation had many more invi
tations to dinner than they could
have accepted even if there had been
more days. Among those who enter
tained them were Judge Foster, for
merly in Derby. They ,vere also
guests of E. W. Bailey wmlo there.
Their support of llng'iei brought
many of these Invitations. Mr. Almon
said it was half an hour before tin
cheering stopped wh;.:t Roosevelt's
letter was read an 1 lint it lasted as
much longer when Lou.;') addressed
the convention directly after the
Rooseveit. letter askl if that the con
ention endorse Hughes instead of
himself as suggested by Roosevelt.
Probably Vermont was more pr iinl-
nent in this convention than she has
ever been in any repiudaan c :ivcn
tion in her history, llei delegates
were equally prominent in th gather
ings outside the convent ion. --M utpd

GRADtD DISTRICT
HOTTRMV
IIS CHARTER
Question Coming Before Annual
School Meeting
WOULD SAVE SOME IN COST
School Meeting Comes on Friday Juno
30 Terms of Two Trustees
Will Expire.
The annual school meeting of tho
graded district will bo held at high
school hall on Friday, June 30 at 8 o'
clock in the evening.
The most important question to
come before the meeting is the pro
posal to appoint a committee of citi
zens to investigate and report whether
it is desirable for the graded district
to throw up its charter and become a
patt of the town district.
Under the present state laws a
graded district seems to get the worst
of it in the distribution of public
money and the Bennington district tho
coming year will lose some $1000 in
state school money that the district
has had in the past. This means that
the. district will have to raise the ad
ditional money by taxation. Under the
circumstances the trustees thought tho
question of giving up the graded chart
er ought to be investigated.
The terms of two trustees expire
this year, C. S. Perry in ward 7 and
Frank K. Howe in ward u. The school
report in being prepared and will bo
out before the annual meeting. The
warning is as follows:
The legal voters of the Bennington
Graded School District are hereby
notified and warned to meet at High,
school hall, in said district, in the vil
lage of Bennington, on Friday, Juno
0, 101C, at 8 o'clock in the evening, to
transact the following business:
1. To choose a moderator for the
ensuing year.
2. To hear the reports of the trus
tees and other ollicers of tho said dis
trict, and take action thereon.
3. To see what tax said district will
vote on tiie grand list of said district
to defray the expenses of its schools
and to pay interest and decrease tho
present debt of said district and to de
termine the time when such tax shall
be collected and paid to its treasurer.
4. To see if the district will voto
to collect its taxes under the provis
ions of Chapter CO of the Vermont
Statutes and amendments thereof.
". To elect a clerk, a treasurer, a
collector of taxes, one or more auditors
of said district, and to till nil vacan
cies in the board of Trustees of said
district caused by expiration of term
of office, resignation, death, removal
fiom district or otherwise.
C. To see if the district will appoint
a committee of three citizens, to servo
without pay. to investigate and report
back to tho district on the desirability
of surrendering special charter and
making Bennington a school unit, because-
of the provisions of the new
s( boo! law.
7. To see what sum, if any. the dis
trict will vote to pay its trustees for
their services the ensuing year.
8. To transact any other business
found necessary when met.
