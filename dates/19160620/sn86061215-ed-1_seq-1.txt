Washington, D. C., June
19.
While the whole
country was astir today
with the mobilization of
the national guard for
border duty, President
Wilson directed that his
reply rejecting General
Carranza's demand for the
recall of American troops
from Mexico go forward
immediately.
In refusing to withdraw
the troops the United
States reaffirms the
friendly intentions of the
United States toward the
de facto government in
Mexico and sharply re
bukes General Carranza
for unwarranted charges
and insinuations of bad
faith contained in his com
munication.
Galveston, Tex., June 19.
—The Mexican govern
ment in Yucatan has
issued a proclamation
ordering all Americans
out of Mexico and declar
ing a state of war exist
ing between the two coun
tries, according to pas
sengers arriving this
morning on the Norwegian
steamer Nils from Pro
greso.4 American and
other foreigners are being
taken on board an Ameri
can gunboat at Progreso.
Great excitement is said
to prevail.
Washington, D. C., June 19.—Not
lince the Spanish war has the nation
leen such military activity as today.
More than 100,000 national guards
men in forty-live states are under or
ders to mobilize for Mexican service.
They constitute virtually the entire
military strength of the United States.
President Wilson, through Secretary
Baker, issued the orders yesterday
when It became apparent that the
threatening conditions in northern
Mexico were not improving.
Only drilling and recruiting will be
In order among militia organizations
for the present. All must be mustered
Into federal service. Later they will
be sent to the border for patrol duty,
releasing about 30,000 regulars for
"lervice in Mexico if war actually de
velops.
WARSHIPS ARE READY.
Additional warships also are being
made ready today to hurry south and
stand by Mexican ports to protect
tAmericans. Secretary Daniels, after
the militia order was issued last night,
ordered seven destroyers and nine
other small vessels to join the Ameri

IflRTUALLY ENTIflE MILITARY STRENGTH OFU.S.
IS BEING MOBILIZED PREPARATORY TO GOING TO
MEXICAN BORDER AS RELIEF TO REGULAR TROOPS
Central States
are Mobilizing
Chicago, June 19.—Plans for the
mobilization of the national
guards of nearly all the states
comprising the central depart
ment, U. S. A., for Mexican bor
der service, were practically com
pleted early today, according to
an announcement issued from the
headquarters of Maj. Gen. Thomas
H. Barry, commanding the de
partment
Shortly before 6 o'clock this
morning, Oen. Barry received in
structions from the war depart
ment, which will be put into ef
fect today. The headquarters re
mained open all night during con
ferences of staff officers.
Telephone calls came from ad
jutant generals in most of the
states nearby, asking for instruc
tions and information as to what
was expected of them.
In Illinois national guard cir
cles there was unusual activity fol
lowing the issuance of the order
calling out all but two of the eight
regiments by Adjt. Gen. Frank S.
Dickson. In Chicago, it was an
nounced, the quota of approxi
mately 4,000 guardsmen from this
city was expected to be on its way
to the mobilization encampment
at Springfield within the next
forty-eight hours.
Officials of railroads centering
in Chicago were early preparing
for the immediate movement of.
troops.
The states included in Gen.
Barry's department are Illinois,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wiscon
sin, Minnesota, Iowa, North and
South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,
Wyoming, Colorado, Missouri and
Arkansas.
As an indication of the rapidity
with which officers of the Chicago
regiments worked after receipt of
the news that they had been called
for Mexican border duty, shortly
after midnight, it was stated every
trooper of the first cavalry had
been notified by special delivery
letter to appear today for mobiliza
tion. United States postal special
carriers worked all night deliver
ing these letters to officers and
men.
When 500 men of the first in
fantry, who had marched yester
day before a moving picture Cam
era at Camp Logan, arrived in the
city last night and heard the news,
they refused to disperse and go
home. They formed ranks again
and marched through the down
town district to their armory,
where most of them remained un
til late watching for develop
ments.
It was announced early today
that Chicago manufacturers who
have members of the national
guard in their employ will put no
obstacles in the way of the men
ordered south. S. M. Hastings,
president of the Illinois Manufac
turers' association, said the va
cated jobs will be waiting when
the men come back.
Under the orders of President
Wilson, the following are the
Illinois national guards to go to
the front:
First cavalry, Col. Milton J.
Foreman first infantry, Col.
Joseph Sanborn second infantry,
Col. John J. Garrity seventh
Infantry, Col. Daniel Moriarity
fourth infantry, Col. E. J. Lang
third infantry, Col. Charles H.
Greene eighth infantry, Col.
Franklin Denison. The fifth and
sixth infantry regiments were
not called.
ILLINOIS GETS READY.
Springfield, 111., June 19.—Eight
freight car loads of camp equip
ment were being rushed back to
Springfield today from E^t. Sheri
dan in charge of Capt. A. I. Sim
mons, detailed as quartermaster
at the abandoned summer camp
of instruction there. This was
the first train movement as the
result of the mobilization orders
issued to national guard organiza
tions of Illinois by Adjt. Gen.
Frank S. Dickson shortly before
dawn.
At the mobilization camp in the
state fair grounds", which^ are
dotted with huge buildings in
tended for exhibits of produce and
live stock laid out around a mile
race track, Gen. Dickson and the
assistant adjutant general, Col.
Richings J. Shand, with four regu
lar army officers were fixing up
camp sites for the various organ

Columbus, N. M., June
19.—More than 100 Mexi
cans employed by the U. S
army in rebuilding the
motor road from Colum
bus to the American field
bases in Mexico quit today
and left camp at Palomas,
eight miles south of the
border, for interior points
in Mexico. They explained
that they feared the ven
geance of Carranza fol
lowers.
El Paso, Tex., June 19—Develop
ments in the Mexican situation, crowd
ing one on the heels of the other in the
last thirty-six hours, caused excite
ment today paralleling that following
the crossing of the frontier by the
American expeditionary command at
Columbus, N. M., more than three
months ago.
American military authorities admit
ted that every preparation had been
made for eventualities but asserted
that no trouble is anticipated in this
immediate locality.
BELL IS READY.
Gen. George Bell, Jr., commanding
the El PaBO military district, seemed
confident today that with the 3,500
troops on station here hue is prepared
to cope with any emergency. Some con
sideration, however, was given a rumer
that a body of Carranza soldiers, esti
mated at 5,000, is encamped about
twenty miles south of Juarez, prepared
if necessary, to reinforce the garrison
of 4,000 and that 8,000 Carranzistas
left Villa Ahumada, eighty-three miles
south, yesterday for El Valle, south
east of Dublan, one of Gen. Pershing's
field bases. This report, however,
could not be confirmed and was not
generally believed.
CROWD IS QUIETED.
Reports also were current that Gen.
Jacinto Trevino, Carranza commander
of the army of the north, is arming all
male citizens above the age of 18, fol
lowing his recruiting campaign for
which orders were recently issued by
the Mexican minister of war. News
that the fourth expedition had been
withdrawn from Mexico, after a brief
campaign and Secretary Baker's state
ment that the new draft of national
guardsmen are for border duty only as
needed and not for increasing Geu.
Pershing's command had a quieting ef
fect in Juarez, aB it filtered through to
the masses of the people. While large
number of persons gathered about the
plaza In the Mexican town, the excite
ment, as in El Paso, was confined
largely to speculation as to eventuali
ties. With the military on both banks
of the river taking increased precau
tions, no demonstrations were ex
pected.
Pershing Plans Dash
Columbus, N. M., June 19.—Notwith
standing the threat of Gen. Trevina,
the Mexican commander, to attack him
if he moves in any direction except
toward the border, Gen. Pershing, field
commander of the American expedi
tionary column in Mexico, is said to Tic
quietly laying plans for quick dashes
north and south at the first sign of
open hostility. His plans, it is believed
by observers, are to gain possession of
the Mexico Northwestern railroad,
which practically commands the terri
tory adjacent to his line of communica
tion.
Gen, Pershing's men slept on their
arms last ilight.
The American commander is in re
ceipt dally of information regarding do

NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA
AND ILLINOI8 AT ONCE.
San Antonio, Tex., June 19.—It was
indicated at headquarters of the south
ern department today that Gen. Funs
ton would request the war department
to send him first the militia of New
York, Pennsylvania and Illinois. The
designation of militia units for service
along the Mexican border will be made
by the war department, but it was
pointed out that Gen. Funston believed
he could make practical use immed
iately of the organizations from those
states. He and his staff were quite
content that the work of organizing
and equipping the militia, especially
that from most of the states, be done
at home stations and many of the of
ficers here who witnessed the work of
getting the guardsmen of Texas, New
Mexico and Arizona into shape ex
pressed the hope that none would be
sent south until they had been drilled
for a time and made partially fit at
least for service in the field.
Must Keep Balance.
Gen. Funston and his staff were
chiefly concerned today in a study of
how best to maintain the delicate bal
ance between the United States and
Mexico until the militia organizations
began to arrive. Officers at depart
ment headquarters believed it improb
able that any of the state troops would
get to border stations before ten days
and that even then only a small per
centage of the total expected would be
available for service.
Report* from the border early today
told of no new raids. Anti-American
demonstrations took place yesterday
in Mexican towns and the feeling gen
erally throughout the frontier was
that Carranza's troops or civilian or
ganizations in Mexico might percipi
tate a clash but extreme caution was
taken by American officers along the
line and by Gen. Pershing to give no
cause for aggression.
Will Take Action.
If another raid does occur or if Gen.
Trevino permits any of his troops to
attack Gen. Pershing's lines, swift ac
tion will be taken by the Americans
but if thefre is anything the Americans
can do to avert trouble it will be done.

Des Moines, June 19.—In a state
ment made public at 1 o'clock today,
Adjt. Gen. Guy E. Logan of the Iowa
national guard, declared that advices
reaching him led him to believe that
mobilization of the Iowa guard would
be ordered by the federal war depart
ment before 6 o'clock tonight. The
adjutant general would not reveal the
source of his information.
He said everything was in readiness
for troop movements, that every coin
mander in the state was on the qui
vive and that a minimum of delay
would result when the mobilization
order finally was issued.
Muscatine, Clinton, Davenport and
Dubuque guardsmen may be concen
trated at Davenport and brought to
Des Moines on a special. Cedar Rapids
Waterloo, and Marshalltown may be
concentrated at one of the three towns
and brought to Des Moines in a body
or may come separately.
Railroads In Iowa have promised
officers of the guard promptly to fur
nish cattle cars and freight cars for
the immediate delivery of cavalry, ar
tillery and ambulance corps equip*
ment.
Company and Band Ready
The call to arms issued by the presi
dent to the state militia organizations
of the country strikes Ottumwa with
some force for this city has an Infan
try company in the national guard
and a band assigned to the cavalry
of the state militia.
Neither Captain Schamp of Co. G,
third Idwa infantry, nor Director
Cleveland Dayton of the First Caval
ry band have received orders from
their superiors to make ready for
service at the Mexican border.
The guardsmen will have to bnild
up considerable In numbers to reach
their war footing, while the band will
have to cut down as the civilian
strength of the latter organization is
much in excess of the war footing
which Is placed at twenty-eight men.
Capt. C. E. Schamp of Co. says
that the present enlistment of the com
pany is fifty-seven, and to bring it up
to the full strength of war times will
necessitate seventy-five additional
men. Many Ottumwans have oftered
their services in the event of a call.
The heads of both organizations
state that they can be ready in twen
ty-four hours' notice and both are
awaiting orders from their superiors
ready to act at once upon the receipt
of instructions.
Despite the various reports and ru
mors about the streets regarding the
orders' issued to the military com
panies of the state, the heads of the
two local organizations are abiding
their time until the proper authority
and instructions are given. Both men
are aB much at sea as to just what
may be done with the state troops as
is the general public and are not haz
arding any guesses, stating that they
await their instructions from the
proper authorities.
Officers Take Oath.
Capt. Schamp stated that insofar as
the officers are concerned there will
be no need of being mustered into the
.service as the oath taken by the of
ficers some three weeks ago obligates
them to go wherever the war depart
ment orders. With regard to the rank
and file, he said that they are sub
ject to the call of the war department
for duty anywhere in the country and
this would include border patrol duty.

GRADE SCHOOL BOY
STARTS MOVEMENT
Suggests in Letter City Get
Piece of Edstrom's Work
to Inspire Youth
The committee in charge of the
movement to have a piece of sculpture
made by David Edstrom placed in the
public library, despite the fact that
nothing has been recently announced
as to its activities, is busy with thin
project.
This movement that had its incep

others to have struck a responsive

of the sphool boy was to hare some
