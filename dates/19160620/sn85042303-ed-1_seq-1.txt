OFFICERS LEADING TROOPCSS IN MEXICO
The truculent attitude of General Carranza, de facto president of Mexico,
asserting that a move by the American troops in any direction but north
would invite attack, called attention to the long line of communication and
supplies between Columbus, N. M., nnd Namiquipa, Mexico. This line is about
200 miles long. It must be guarded If serious peril to the American forces
in Mexico is to be averted. Picture shows officers leading cavalrymen in
Mexico in line of march. At their head is Colonel Tate of the Eleventh cavalry.
At the meeting of the hotel com
mittee today every subscription to the
proposed one hundred and seventy
five thousand-dollar hotel company
was checked up and it was found .that
a mediocre amount stood between the
city and closing up the deal. Some
of the heavy subscribers doubled their
subscriptions, and others raised it,
and at the close of the meeting Chair
man S. A. Apple gave out the follow
ing statement.
"I wish I could authorize you to
say that the money was raised or at
least in sight. We tried to do this,
and have been working for the past
three hours, and still there lacks $2,
975. I believe there are still plenty of
men who will not hesitate to sub
scribe and that this amount will be
raised within the next twenty-four
hours.
