SEVEN TYPHOID
GASES ARE FOUND
Children Near Nawiliwili De
velop The Disease A
Cleanup Wanted
Seven new cases of typhoid fever
have developed in the past few days
in the Nawiliwili ncighlmrhood.
All arc children. Five are children
of a Japanese named Matsuda and
two are children of Joseph I, mail
driver on the Hanalei route. All
have been taken to the Lihue hospi
tal where they are l)cing treated.
The Matsuda and I houses are on
the left side of the road coming from
Nawiliwili toward Lihue. and are
backed by the rice field. They are
just outside of the more thickly pop
ulated section of the town.
Two cases appearing a few months
ago not far away on the Grove Farm
road enlisted much concern, and
the presence now of cases by whole
sale has created genuine alarm' The
medical authorities feel that the
source of infection must be gone
after at once and vigorously, and
steps to that end will be taken
without delay.
Inasmuch as typhoid fever is not
contagious in the ordinary sencc,
quarantine is not called for. The
fight is against the source of infec
tion, which, in the present ease, is
probably on the premises from
which the eases have been removed
or in the neighboring rice field.
SMALL BLAZE AT
FAIRVIEW HOTEL
During the dinner hour at Hotel
Lihue Wednesday evening there
was an alarm of fire, and the
guests rushed out to find the blaze
in one of the cottages back of the
main building. About that time
Major Rice and the staff of the
hotel appeared on the scene, arm
ed with Pyrene extinguishers. The
fire was out in a few second.
When first discovered the fire
had burned away a mosquito net
and had enveloped the bed in one
of the rooms. The walls were also
being charred. A few minutes
more and the building would have
been in flames.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
but general circumstances point
to a man, a cigarette and careless
ness, MAKAWELI CAMP
Last Wednesday night at Camp
14, Makaweli, a Filipino named
Lorenzo Owen chased after an
other Filipino named Datniano
Ocbania and practically cut off
one of his hands with a huge knife
which he was wielding.
The assailant was in liquor, and
a quarrel of small consequence de
veloped into the murderous attack.
The hand was left banging and
had to be amputated by a suigeon.
Owan was arrested and has been
charged temporarily with assault
with a weapon obviously and em
inently dangerous to life. The
case will come before the grand
jury.
In tnis case law-abiding Fill
pinos of the neighborhood were of
much assistance to the police in
I assembling facts.

police that he accused the woman
of neglecting him. Just before the
tragedy the woman had taken a
walk and, returning sat on the
steps of the house. Gomez came
out of the house with a huge knife.
