AGAIN
TO ERADICATE
THE HOG CHOLERA
Dr. Koen Will Have Assistants at
Work in Many Counties, In­
cluding Hamilton.
Des Moines, June 17.—Extensive
plans for the eradication and control
of hog cholera in some twenty-eight
counties in central Iowa are now be
ing worked out by J. S. Koen, gov
ernment veterinarian and inspector,,
and Dr. J. I. Gibson, state veterin
arian for Iowa. Dr. Koen, who has
had charge of the government work
in Dallas county for the past few
yearB, will move to Des Moines and
have his headquarters here. Substa
tions will be established at Marshall
town, Iowa Falls, Fort Dodge, Storm
Lake and Manning and possibly at
Creston.
Dr. Gibson an'd Dr. Koen made a
tour of Dallas county yesterday and
the work which the government has
done there in the past two years was
gone over. The government's plan
in that county has worked out so
successfully that It is to be extended
to the other counties.
The counties which Dr. Koen will
have charge of and in which he will
have assistant veterinarians to work
out tlic government's plans are as
follows: Marshall, Tama, Borne,
Clay, Cherokee, Buena Vista, Poca
hontas, Humboldt, Wright, Frank
lin, Ida,
Sac,
Calhoun, Webster,
Hamilton, Hardin, Crawford, Car
roll, Greene, Shelby, Audubon,
Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Madison, War
ren and probably Adair, Adams and
Union.
It will be the most extensive plan
yet undertaken for hog cholera con
trol and prevention in the middle
west. Especial attention will be
given to sanitation with a view to
keeping the disease out after it is
once eradicated.
The losses from hog cholera have
not been so serious the last year or
so as they were in 1911 and 1912.
Nevertheless the government and
state officials hope to use prevention
and sanitary measures so that it will
never again afflict the state as it has
in the past. In 1912 the loss in
Marshall county was 48,293 head
according to figures compiled by the
state agricultural department:Buena
Vista. 68,286 Sac, 67,715 Webster,
40,381 Crawford, 71,865 Polk, 20,
937 and so on through the whole list
of counties. The losses were gener
al throughout the whole state. Those
counties which had the most hogs
suffered the largest losses.
The complete details of the plan
have not yet been worked out and
won't be until after Dr. Koen opens
his offices here.
A special meeting of the stock
holders of the Webster City Outing
Club will be held at the club house
on the 22nd of June, at 7:30 o'clock
p. m., to consider and act on the
amendment of the articles of incor
poration changing the date of the
annual meeting of stockholders and
to transact any other business that

Horse Racing on Walnut Street Sun­
day Afternoon—Perpetrators
ar^ Unknown. 1
Two young men from the country
made spectacles of themselves Sun
day afternoon and night on Walnut
street By racing horses up'and down
the thqrpughfnre. Each drove a fine
horse atta$ a. carriage and
during the afternoon ran the horses
as fast as they could go down the
street and repeated the performance
at night after the church hour. Peo
ple residing on the street are highly
indignant over the affair and if .the
identity of the young men could be
ascertained they would be arrested
for the offense. Their actions riot on
ly disgusted everybody who witness
ed them, but it is a shame to treat
horses in such a manner. One resi
dent of the street tried to stop the
races, but was unable to do so, nor
could he identify the racers. He said
they-were prosperous looking young
men and it is his opinion that they
reside in the country southwest of
town.

Well Known Webster City Citizen
Has an Idea Worth While in
Relaion to Interurban Road.
It appears that because of so much
opposition developing to the proposi
tion of voting an eight mill tax in
aid of the construction of a depot in
Webster City for the Crooked Creek
railroad, the company is not going to
ask tor the tax but will electrify the
road and build the depot anyhow.
The road is certainly exercising the
right spirit in this matter and prac
tically everybody wants to see the
proposed improvements made.
The suggestion made to the Free
man-Tribune by the aforesaid Web
ster City citizen is this: For the
people to vote them an eight mill
tax if they will electrify the line and
build it down Second street as far as
the market square, where a passen
ger depot could be erected. This
scheme contemplates that the road
build from Prospect south to the
Johnson house corner, thence east
on Second street to Superior, or near
that point. It would give Webster
City a very citified appearance to
have an electric road down the main
business street, with car service run
ning each hour and it would probab
ly pay the company to make the im
provement.
It is worth considering, anyhow,
and if the management of the road
looks with favor upon such a plan
it is likely a tax would be voted with
little opposition. Of course there
will be some opposition to permitting
the road to run down Second street,
but when such improvements are al
lowed upon the main streets of such
villages as Chicago, New York, Phil
adelphia, Paris, Berlin and London
it may be that Webster City will
consider that Second street traffic is
not too congested for the additional
business such a road would bring to
the street.

If there is anything difficult in the way of being well dressed, it
