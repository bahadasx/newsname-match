RUSSIAN VICTORY
IS FAR-REACHING
PAHI8, June 20 The military ex
perts here regard the diplomatic results
of the Busaian victory at Caernowita
as more important than the military
or strategic. With Caernowita, capital
of the Bukowina, ia Bussiaa hands, it
is assumed that the -Bussian armies will
soon have, if they have not already,
essential control ef that province.
Would Dominate Komanla
This, if it is followed by the success
es which seem to be forecasted in an
invasion of Austria will place the Bus
aians ia a position to dominate Buma
nia at many points. In the comments
upoa the result of the Bussian control
of the Bukowina, much more attention
is given to the possible diplomatic re
sults ia the Balkans; than to the im
mediate military success. "
Has Hew Card To piny
The Bukowina was a part of Buma
aia twice in history, and the peoples of
the two countries are muflh affiliated.
If Bussia haa now" wrested the Buko
wina from Austria-Hungary, it ia argu
ed, she has a new card to play in the
complicated Balkan diplomatic game.

Washington Will
Give "Mexicans
Final Word
(AasoeUtsd rresr fcr Fsaeral Wireless.)
WASHINGTON, June 20.
The issue of war or peace
between the United States and
Mexico hinges now on Carranza's
attitude after a stern refusal of
his demands of withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico,
which it is expected will be hand
ed to his minister today. An in
cident of the day, indicating the
uncompromising ' attitude of the
administration, was a refusal of
Secretary oP'State Lansng, to
confer with Dr. Elisco Arredondo,
the Mexican minister. Mr. Lan
sing'i response to a request from
Arredondo for a conference was
that he was too busy.
Reply Will Be Curt
The business upon which he
was engaged was in part the pre
paration of the reply to the
lengthy note which Carranza ad
dressed to the United States on
June 1.
The reply to the Carranza note,
it is stated, will be not only a
curt refusal to grant the de facto
government's formal demand,
which was made in the language
of an ultimatum, that the Amer
ican troops in Mexico be with
drawn, but also a vigorous reply
to the charges brought by Car
ranza against the good faith of
Kiiiiii
... V
Will Caus WmjOr Bring Peace
Yd
the American government Vf In
spite of the last five years of Am
erican avoidance of military in
tervention, in Mexico, Carranza
charged that there were ulterior
motives in th .expedition leliby
General Pershing against Villa,
after the Columbus raid.
Patience It Exhausted
This attitude of the de facto
president of Mexico, who was
only enabled to win leadership
from hiij rivals by the recognit6n
of the Washington government,
has exhausted the patience of the
administration, and it is said that
the note which Secretary Lansing
will hand to; Minister Arredondo,
as a reply to Carranza's long effu
sion, will be in very forcible
terms. That it may quickly Ied
to a formal rupture between the
two governments, and war, is rec
ognized. Carranza Plays Politics
Under this view of the matter,
it is thought, Carranza might at
home claim a diplomatic triumph
in his having attempted to make
an American invasion of Mexico
the casus belli. This might bring
him great popularity id Mexico
and bring together the warring
factions in Mexico under his lead
ership. If war has to be waged, the de
feat of Mexico Is regarded as
quite certain, and Carranza knows
this. It is believed by officials
who take this view that all that
the Mexican president hopes for
is a war in which, after defeating
; -v . - .,. . .
War Seems Near
And Wilson
Prepares
his armies, the United States will
be magnanimous in making peace
terms, and then he will be firmly
seated in power as president of
Mexico. It is thought that if Am
erica begins a real war upon Mex
ico, the Carranza government, if
it remains in power will very gborfj
sue tor peace.
No Further Controversy .
The administration is utterly
ignoring all the claims and de
mands set forth in the Carranza
note, and is pursuing its policy
without regard to the views which
the Mexican, de facto president so
carefully enunciated. The state
department officials say that there
will be ny further controversy,
and that if the Carranza govern
ment insists upon its ultimatum,
war will result at once, and the
rapidly mobilizing forces of the
United States will be used to
bring the Mexicans to terms.
The Mexican minister's request
for a conference with Secretary of
State Lansing is taken as an in
dication of Mexican alarm, caus
ed by the President's calling out
of the militia, which showed his
intention to take action. . The
refusal of the secretary to hold
another conference means, , if is
stated, that as far a the Ameri

Text of Obnoxious Note Is Insulting
The Csrranza note referred tH in
the foregoing despatches from Wash
ington, hh one which has met Vita a
"stern refusal", upon Carranza's re
ception of which refusal depends the
issue of war or peace, was delivered
in Wusbingtoa on. June 1. It has been
commented on aa sarcastic, offensive
and even insulting in tone. It wan a
note of 12,000 words, demanding im
mediate withdrawal of America
troops from Mexico, and charging a
no indirect terras' that the American
government 'a professions, of ne-intent
Teally to invade Mexico were not made
n Rood faith.'- The Concluding word,
reading like an ultimatum, are: . jf
"The Mexican government therefore
invites the United States to bring to
an end this unsupportable situation
and t. support its protestations of nod
declarations of friendshp by an imme
diate withdrawal of American troops."
"The American government,' says
the note," has admitted that the work
of the expedition which entered Mex
ico after the olumbua raid, naw ia
over. But, iu spite of this fact, Amer
ican troops still remain on Mexican
soil. To contend that political dis
order in this 'country justifies, thW set
of (ho American military forces is ia
convict with the repeated professions
of (he Washington govornment rela
tive to non-interference." ,
America Is Blamed
The note points out that much of
th ttouble In Mexico is due "to toe
attitude of the United Htutes in not
JMinishing conspirators in the United
Itates who have plotted the downfall
pf the present Constitutionalist gov
ernment and to the acts of Washing
ton in refuting to permit the ship
ment of arms and ammunition to in
ter Mexico."

"The Mexican government haa just
received advices that a group of
Ameriinii troops has crossed the
frontier and penetrated Mexican
territory unri nt present is near a place
called Kl I'ino, some seventy anile to
the south f the frontier. This newly
effected ms8n(;e of troopa without the

places in grave danger th. harmony

After reciting the facta which U'd
