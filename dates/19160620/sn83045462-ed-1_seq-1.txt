Editorial Correspondence of The Star.
* BY THEODORE W. NOTES.
( The assault of thin year on the halfand-half
law duplicates In essential*
that of last year. The difference between
tweedledum and tweedledee is no
less than that between the Johnson
amendment of 1015 and the legislative
rider carried by this year's District appropriation
bill.
Both destroy the half-and-half law by
indirection, suggesting a vague scheme
of indefinite proportionate contribution
and repealing: inconsistent legislation.
The Johnson amendment "provides for
payment of the expenses of the District
out of District revenues, to the extent
that they kre "available," and the "balance"
sh^il be paid out of the Treasury.
This year's rider provides that appropriations
for the support of the District
shall be paid out of District revenues
to the extent that the same shall be
"sufficient" therefor and the "remainder"
out of the Treasury.
Both legislative provisions suggest an
intent that the nation shall not pay as
much as one-half of District expenses.
The -Johnson amendment carries the specific
provision that the national contribution
shall be less than one-half of
the total appropriation. But this provision
does not indicate that last year's
appropriation bill was any more hostile
to a half-payment by the nation than
this year's bill. These words were introduced
last year to suggest a reduction of
expenses, and thus to avoid the point of
order against new legislation on an appropriation
bill. Thjs device was not
necessary in 1916. fOr the legislative rider
was made Jn order this year by a rule
which the* House rules committee reported
by a vote of 3 to 2. and the House
ratified by a vote of 177 to 136.
, Both appropriation bills carry the same
evidences of hostility to a national halfcontribution
and of a determination to
increase the local tax burden and to decrease
the capital contribution of the
nation. Jn 1915 the District Commi*.
I toners' estimates were cut down by the
House Tht? year the
House cut down the Commissioners' estimates
$3,578,939. This year the local
contribution toward capital upbuilding
is increased and the national contribution
correspondingly decreased in even
greater proportion than last year by an
extension of the Borland amendment to
macadam pavement, by payment of
aqueduct and filtration plant maintenance
from the water rentals in which
the United States, getting its water free,
does not participate and by the extraction
from District citizens of a rental tax for
the -use of vault space under sidewalks.
Thus the Johnson amendment of last
year and the legislative rider of this
year are the same In purpose. In substance,
and in effect. The Johnson
amendment was rejected overwhelmingly
lgst year by the Senate appropriations
committee and by the Senate
by a vote of 46 to SO. Unless conditions
have changed or new evidence has been
discovered the Senate would naturally
net now as It did last year on a renewal
of last year*s objectionable proposition.
Why Change and Vote Repeal ?
What, if anything, has happened
since last year to suggest to. the Senate
a change of mind on this issue?The
congressional joint fiscal committee
has reported that there is no
necessity today for the half-and-half
provision and no reason for any prej
else arbitrary proportionate contribution.
In the same breath the joint committee
declares that the half-and-half
law is fair to the nation; that under it
Washington pays its full equitable contribution
toward capital upbuilding
and is adequately assessed and taxed;
and that instead of paying less than
at present for capital development the
nation should in equity and in response
to patriotic pride pay more.
While the committee thaa holds np
the Inper of dabloas disapproval at
the balf-aad-half lan In the abstract,
It riddles and destroys In specific detail
the reasons advanced last year for
the repeal of the half-and-half law. It
svcfCRta that there Is no reason or necessity
to contlnne the half-and-half
law and then proceeds to demonstrate
that there Is no reason or necessity to
repeal It.
The reasons assigned last year for
repeal in congressional debate were:
tl) Washingtonians are grossly underassessed.
Their realty in 1912 was
properly valued at $744,000,000, whereas
the assessor on the 100 per cent
basis valued it at only $495,000,000.
(2) Washington is the most lightly
taxed of American cities, about half
taxed compared with^the average large
city. (3) If Washington realty were
assessed and taxed like that of other
cities enough money would be raised to
meet all expenses of capital upbuilding
without a cent of contribution by
i the United States. Therefore most
logically and naturally the half-and,
half law should be repealed.
To be convinced that these were the
reasons assigned for the repeal of the
half-and-half law it will be necessary
only to glance at the following refer1
ences to last year's debates: Representative
Prouty, Cong. Rec., vol. 61. pp.

Department of State, t
Washington, June 20, 1916.
Sir: I have read your communication,
which was delivered to me May 22, 1916,
under instructions of the chief executive of
the de facto government of Mexico, on the
subject of the presence of American troops
in Mexican territory, and I would be wanting
in candor if I did not, before making answer
to the allegations of fact and the conclusions
reached by your government, express the surprise
and regret which have been caused this
government by the discourteous tone and temper
of this last communication of the de facto
government of Mexico.
Cites Bloodshed and Disorders.
The government of the United States has
viewed witn deep concern anu mn casing disappointment
the progress of the revolution in
Mexico. Continuous bloodshed and disorders
have marked its progress. For three years
the Mexican republic has been torn with civil
strife; the lives of Americans and other
aliens have been sacrificed; vast properties
developed by American capital and enterprise
have been destroyed or rendered non-productive;
bandits have been permitted to roam at
will through the territory contiguous to. the
United States and to seize, without punishment
or without effective attempt at punishment,
the property of Americans, while the
lives of citizens of the United States who ventured
to remain in Mexican territory or to
return there to protect their interests have
been taken, and in some cases barbarously
taken, and the murderers have neither been
apprehended nor brought to justice. It would
be difficult to find in the annals of the history
of Mexico conditions more deplorable than
those which have existed there during these
recent years of civil war.

state of constant apprehension and turmoil
because of frequent and sudden incursions
into American territory and depredations and
mprders on American soil by Mexican bandits
who have taken the lives and destroyed
the property of American citizens, sometimes
carrying American citizens across the international
boundary with the booty seized. American
garrisons have been attacked at night,
American soldiers killed and their equipment
and horses stolen; American ranches have
been raided, property stolen and destroyed,
and American trains wrecked and plundered.
The attacks on Brownsville, Red House
Ferry, Progreso Post Office and Las Peladas, ,
all occurring during September last, are typical.
In these attacks on American territory,
Carrancista adherents, and even Carrancista
soldiers took part in the looting, burning and

indifference of the de facto government to
these atrocities gone that some of these leaders,
as I am advised, have received not only
the protection of that government, but encouragement
and aid as well.

been still more numerous. This government

Fullam, adjutant of the 3d Infantry.
With the call to arms spurring young
men to enlist in a manner which could

the recruiting is going on today in several
different sections of the city. In

Fullam said this morning that, headed
by the Third Infantry Band, the 3d
Regiment of Infantry would march up

stories brought here today by
Americans ariving from the interior.
Peons who for some time
have been on the verge of starvation
have been flocking to his
standard in the last few days in
return for promises of food and
clothing, they said. No applicacants
have been rejected, acordcants
have been rejected, according
to the stories, which told of
boys of ten and twelve years of
age and old men being recruited.
One of the arrivals, an American business
man of Mexico City, estimated
that there are now 25,000 Carranaa
troops in Chihuahua state, of whom
about 2,000 are in Chihuahua City,
4,000 in Juarez, and 6,000 in Villa Ahumada,
the northern Chihuahua base,
which is ninety-three miles south of
El Paso. _
Had to Eat Raw Beans.
The remainder practically surround
the American expeditionary command
on/ the south, east and west. He said
also that several thousand troops, which
had been at Chihuahua recently were
sent toward San Antonio and Madera,
ostensibly to be stationed along the
line of the Mexican Northwestern railway,
south of Gen. Pershing's command,
mand.
The refugees brought with them
'graphic stories of economic conditions.
I One man said that he and his fellow
passengers would have starved bad
not the train stopped at times long
| enough to allow them to get out and
eat raw beans from fields. Another
said he had vainly offered five dollars,
I American gold, for a tortilla.
"The Mexicans are desperate," a refugee
from the El Valle district said.
"Even though the attitude otherwise
might be friendly, hunger is apt to
force them to attack an American supply
train."
?1 Paso and Juarez Quiet.
Both El Paso and Juarez remained
outwardly calm today, but in both
towns soldiers were kept close to their
camps. The number of Americana
crossing into Juarez today was smaller
than usual, but none of them reported
any manifestations of hostility. Educated
Mexicans, some of whom have
been living in El Paso and others who
have arrivea nere recently nwm interior
points in the United States, have
been crossing the frontier in large
numbers recently, asserting that their
place in the crisis is with their people.
T. D. Edwards, consul in Juarez, established
a desk in the American cuztomshouse
for the transaction of diplomatic
business. He denied that the
consiflate is to be closed, but said that
it is to remain in charge of a clerk,
open at specified hours for the transaction
of commercial business.
Detachments detailed bv Gen. Francisco
Gonzales oij the Mexican side of

Jr., on thelAmerican side, to investigate
reports that the body of an American
killed in Texas had been found on the
Chihuahua side, reported they were
unable to find any trace of such a body.
Civilians Armed in Nacozari.
DOUGLAS, Ariz., June 20.?One hundred
Americans, including about twenty
women and children, arrived here
today from Nacozari, Mexico.
Early Sunday morning the official
message of Gov. De La Huerta. calling
on the citizens to arm themselves,
was received in Nacozari and Pi lares,
twin mining camps. In Pilares the
miners rounded up all Americans and
held them under armed guard for
twenty-four hours.
In the meantime arms were distributed
in the plaza to all persons, even
women, girls and boys, who applied for
them. Similar scenes were enacted in
Nacozari. though Americans were not
molested there. Monday, under orders
from Gen. Calles, the prisoners in Pilares
were released. At 5 o'clock orders
came through the company management
from Consul Frederick Sirnpich
that foreigners must leave Mexico
at once.
A number of Mexican families accompanied
the Americans as far north
as Agua Prieta, but before crossing the
line they were forced to leave the train
by orders of Gen. Calles. Three French
subjects in Cum pas also are preparing
to come to the border.
