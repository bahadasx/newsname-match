San Antonio, June 20. Gen
eral Funston today requested
the war department to send to
him as soon as possible a large
part of the national guardsmen
to be stationed along the Mexi
can boundary "from Brownsville
to the Pacific ocean." He did
not make public the exact num
ber requested but said he had
asked for enough to provide
"adequate protection" of the
border. He also withheld the
names of the stations to which
the guardsmen would be sent, al
though admitting that a consid
erable force would be mobilized
at San Antonio as a reserve.
General Funston explained that in
making this request he acted only on
the presumption that he was securing
an army for defense and that the sta
tions select 1 had been chosen with
that idea in mind; that if it became
necessary to organize an army of in
vasion he would supplement the re
quest of today with one for the bal
ance of the guard.
Keep Units Intact,
Those asked for today include units
m all branches of the service. He
did not specify to the war department
preference for the units rrom any pttr-,-,.i:,r
state but assumed that the first
to be went probably would be those
from New York, Illinois and Penn
sylvania. So far as possible the state
troops will enter the border service
with unbroken units. Regiments will
be kept intact and. if possible, even
the division organizations will be
maintained.
It became known today that the
quartermaster department here has
been instructed to advertise imme
diately for the purchase of 26.500 cav
alry horses. 15.100 artillery horses.
8.000 wheel mules. 8.100 lead mules
and 8.000 pack mules.
Got General Funston's Order.
Washington. June 20. General
Funston's request for national
guardsmen reached the war depart
ment after noon and resulted in tele
graphic requests for information as to
when the forces of certain states
would be able to move. Orders for
entrainment of units ready for service
were expected before night.
Special Train for Americans.
Wa-shington. June 20. Special
Apent Rodgers at Mexico City, notified
the state department today that he
was arranging for a special train to
take Americans and other foreigners
from Mexico City to Vera Cruz. He
said he would remain at his post.
Mr. Rodgers's message told of anti
American demonstrations, parades
and mass meetings in the Mexican
capital and increasingly bitter senti
ment. No open acts of violence are
reported.

er the result will mean war depends
on the Mexicans, and General Car
ranza is so informed. Citizens of both
nations apparently are preparing for
it- Opposing military forces are fac
ing each other in the border region.
Mobilization of the national guard in
every state was being rushed today.
General Carranza in another speech
at Mexico City, however, has ex
pressed the hope that hostilities may
be avoided.
Mexican government troops were
reported last night marching on Del
Rio, 100 miles up the Rio Grande
from Eagle Pass with the intention of
attacking.
Get Pay from Employers,
New York, June 20. Hundreds of
members of the national guard regi
ments remained in their armories last
night and at all armories officers and
men are preparing for mobilization
at Beekman. N. Y. Some of the troops
expected orders to start for the camp
today. Recruiting for most of the
regiments to bring them up to their
full war strengtn oi 150 men to a com
pany of infantry is proceeding rapidly.
Adopting the example set by the may
or, many employers of guardsmen an
nounced that the pay of the men re
sponding to the call would be con
tinued in full or in part.
The Western Union Telegraph
company announced that any of its
employes in any part of the country
who have been in the service of the
company more than a year will re

service provided this, with a military
pay, does not exceed their normal
salaries.

Resnlt of Conference Between
White and Sartin.
Delegates Tell Emporia Man
They'll Support Hughes.
Kansas Progressives will support
Charles E. Hughes, Republican nom
inee for the presidency. Formal ac
tion tending to swing the third party
vote to the former supreme court jus
tice was taken today when Progres
sive presidential electors were with
drawn from nomination records in the
office of J. T. Botkin. secretary of
state. The action was taken following
a conference of William Allen White,
national committeeman; and Lt. is.
Sartin, state chairman of the Progres
sive party.
The action today means that all of
t:id big league men in the Progressive
party in Kansas with the possible ex
ception of Victor Murdock will be
back under the Republican banner in
November. With the removal of
names of their presidential electors
today, both White and Sartin mane
clear that they expected to support
the Republican presidential nominee
They are through with the political
battle of four years ago at least so
far as a, third party is concerned.
Electors Formally Withdrawn.
Notice of the withdrawal of the Bull
Moose presidential electors from the
primary election ballot was sent to
Secretary of State Botkin today. Lat
er White, in a telephone conversation,
verified the report that the Progres
sives were not only coming back but
are here. A majority of the men and
women selected as candidates for elec
tor have already declared their inten
tion to support Hughes, White stated.
The well known Emporia editor is also
back in camp, with Chairman Sartin
at his side. Henry J. Allen returned
within 24 hours after Roosevelt sent
his telegram to the Progressive na
tional convention.
"There will be no Progressive ticket
in Kansas this year so far as I know,"
White stated over the long distance
telephone. "A majority of the dele
gates have already notified me of their
intention to support Hughes. They
virtually withdrew themselves and we
withdrew the rest of them. Letters
which I have received since returning
from Chicago indicate a large major
ity of the Progressives in Kansas will
be for Hughes in November.
In Line With Roosevelt.
"The action today followed a con
ference by Mr. Sartin and myself. We
both decided that Roosevelt would
probably support Hughes in the cam
paign. With Colonel Roosevelt not
running, there was but one thing to do.
So we will be for Hughes now."
Secretary Botkin stated today that

BY CARIi D. GROAT.
Washington, June 20.- Pessimism
over Mexican matters predominated in
official quarters today. Even those
who had hoped American mobilization
would tame Mexico's martial spirit
were today less confident that this
would be the case. A stronger feeling
was that the militia of the United
States may see Mexican service.
One story was that the administra
tion expects to bottle up Mexican
ports at once. Admission was made
by officials that this could be done.
though they did not admit early to
day that this is the anticipated course.
rne Pacinc fleet is on the way to
the west coast of Mexico; other ships
dot both coasts. All are ready for ac
tion. Keep Peace With England.
Tampico is the special point men
tioned in blockade discussion. There,
it is said, a blockade could be laid
without hindering the supply of oil for
the British fleet from the fields up
the Pamuco river. This supply must
not be stopped, officials say, lest
Great Britain and the United States
become involved in a dispute.
The frank pessimism of Secretary
Lansing in his view of Mexican affairs
gives a sinister turn that he has not
hitherto admitted. His note to Car
ranza, said to be the strangest docu
ment yet sent south, was made public
during the day.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo was
slated for a conference with Lansing
this afternoon. The object of his visit
was not revealed. If he planned some
effort to have American troops with
drawn, as some reports said, he was to
be told once for all this now is im
possible. The reports of warlike demonstra
tions from Mexican governors served
to show the trend of affairs.
1,000 Americans in Mexico City.
One state department message re
vealed that the cost of living has in
creased 500 per cent in Mexico City
since June 1. For weeks past chaos
has been pictured by consuls. Knowl
edge of this information has been
withheld in the hope that conditions
might take a turn for the better.
One thousand Americans remain in
Mexico City but many of these are
heeding the repeated warnings to
leave.
Mobilization in many states pro
ceeded rapidly today. Reports indi
cate that the northern states are in
the best state of preparedness.
Secretary Baker has not yet revealed
orders to any state to move toward
the border but with affairs becoming
more sinister momentarily, these or
ders may come at any time.

if made.
"Mexico." said General Carranza,

duty if hostilities are forced on her."
During the days demonstrations the
American consulate was stoned by a
mob. The stoning occurred while
Vice Consul Rowe was in the build-,
ingr and only ten minutes after Spe
cial Representative Rodgers had left
the place. Mr. Rodgers tonight pro
tested against the stoning.
A- meeting of Mexican working
men's organizations decided to send a

committee from the American Feder
ation of Labor and to use every effort

States and Mexico.
Special Train for American Exodus.
It was announced that no restric
tions would be placed on Americans
deeiring to leave Mexico. In answer
to an inquiry made by an emissary of
J. Lynn Rodgers, representative of
American government before the Car
ranza government, the foreign office
said that every assurance would be
given foreigners of protection on their
trip to the coast.
A general exodus among the Ameri
can colony has begun and all who are
able to do so are leaving for Vera
Crx-z or northern border points. Mr.
Rodgers called at the foreign office
for the purpose of arranging for a
special train to leave here Wednes-

HORDE OF PEONS
Train Load of Mexicans
Headed for Kansas.
Is
Coming by Hundreds to Work
on the Railroads.
That the Mexican peons would rath
er work for a good reliable railroad in
the United States than stay in their
native country and take the chance
of having to fight "Gringoes" was
made apparent today when a local
railroad man received word that 1,00
Mexican refuaees had left El Paso,
headed for Topeka with the view of
being put to work by the Santa Fe and
Union PaciTic raiiroaas.
The Mexicans leit tneir own country
secretly because Carranza has recently
issued an order forbidding them to do
so, evidently with the Intention of
forcing them into the army. It is said
that certain Americans on the border
have been making it their business to
help them get across and that they
have been receiving handsome rewards
for their work in some instances.
The Mexicans who come here will
he taken over bv men who are well
versed in handling them and they will
be distributed over the main lines and
branches of the railroads to do sec
tion and other unskilled labor.
It was expected that a part of the
I, 000 refugees would arrive here late
today, and arrangements have been
made to take charge of them and ship
them to places where they can be
used. A large number, it is under
stood, will be sent south of Lawrence

Reports current in national guard
circles today indicate clearly that
Kansas guardsmen may see active ser
vice on the Mexican border at a very
early date. Activities in offices of
Charles I. Martin, adjutant general;
indicated tha't every move was being
made preparatory to an active cam
paign. It is believed the Kansas troops
will be removed to the border next
week.
Orders were issued by General Mar
tin today for the removal of Bat
tery A of Topeka, to Fort Riley Fri
day morning. The Topeka guards
men will be moved by special train j
over the Union Pacific. Thirteen cars
have been chartered to carry members
of the battery and their equipment.
Telegrams received by General Mar
tin today indicated that supplies,
equipment and provisions were being
rushed to Fort Riley from Rock Is-
! land. 111. These supplies will be avail
able when members of the state guard
arrive Friday. With the orders for en
trainment of troops, equipment stored
in the sub-basement of the state house.
were today loaded on cats and sent to
Fort Riley. Four cars were required
to carry the equipment.
. Colonel Rann Goes Ahead.
Field officers from both Kansas
regiments will arrive at Fort Riley
Thursday and formal preparations
will be made for the troopers. Colonel
R. Neil Rahn, assistant adjutant gen
eral, left this afternoon for Fort Riley
and will direct the work from that
point. General Martin may leave
with guard officers and members of
Battery A, arriving at the fort Friday
afternoon.
Rumors today became persistent to
the effect that the Kansas troops
would be held at Fort Riley, but a few
days probably less than a week. No
official statement was made from any
source, but among many of the men
familiar with conditions, there is a de
cided opinion that the federal govern
ment will transport the Kansans to
the Mexican border as soon as ar
rangements can be completed.
National guardsmen in every local
company in Kansas began active mili
tary training today under direction of
Charles I. Martin, adjutant general.
The work which started today at fair
grounds, city parks and public squares,
is the initial move in the mobilization
of the state troops. Guardsmen went
into camp under orders from their
commanding officers and will be buey
with military duties pending final or
ders to entrain.
Members of Battery A, Topeka, en
camped this morning at the state fair
grounds. Mere mud and results of an
early morning rain did not perturb the
soldiers in the slightest degree. They
went into camp with a display of en
thusiasm and spent a busy morning
pitching tents and preparing for the
heavy drill service that must follow
the mobilization.
Recruiting offices, stationed on the
fair grounds, brought many Topekans
and war adventurers to the scene of
encampment. More than twenty-five
applications for enlistment were re
ported this morning by officers in
charge of the work. Capt. J. M. Hite
declared that the battery would be
enlisted to full war footing before the
men are entrained.
General Martin a Bnsy Man.
Battery A is but one of the sorrows
of General Martin, however. He is
busy directing the affairs of com
panies of artillery and infantry in all
sections of the state and he snent an
; almost sleepless night after returning
! fyfm ft, a . . . . .
j from
. Leavenworth. General Martin was in
-" - uiuvcia BVHUUl at. r on
conference with army officers the
, greater portion or the night. Detailed
j plans for the prompt moving of troops
; were discussed.
i This morning General Martin stated
j that he expected to direct all Kansas
' guardsmen to entrain not later than
Friday. A formal order will be issued
during the day.
It is the belief of army officers that
jthe Kansas troops will not be ordered
j ti the Mexican border for two or
I three weeks. This lapse of time will
: permit the establishment of training
quarters ana strenuous daily drills. All
of the men will be immunized against
All I'ndcr Rash Orders.
Plans for the removal of troops
from local stations were outlined to
officers Monday, as General Martin
and the guard officers started for
their homes after the short session of
the officers' school. Troops will be
held awaiting telegraph orders for
their removal to Fort Riley. While
the army officers are busy with their
detailed plans for departure to the
mobilization point, railway officials
are rushing orders in an effort to pro
vide train equipment and service
when the men entrain.
General Martin will probably re

Washington. June 20. With Presi
dent Wilson's firm refusal to with
draw American troops on its way to
the de facto government, embodied in
a note sternly arraigning the whole
course of General Carranza, in the
situation which has brought the two
countries to the verge of war, the ad
ministration continued today its prep
arations to meet any emergency that
may arise.
War or peace rests with General
Carranza. The position of the United
States is pointedly set forth in its re
view of the apparent inability of Car
ranza to prevent border raids and to
keep the obligation he owes the world
by the preservation of order in his
dominions.
""If." says the note, "the de facto
government is pleased .to ignore .Xhis
obligation and to believe that In case
of a refusal to retire these troops there
no further course than to defend
its territory by an appeal to arms.' the
government of the United States
would surely be lacking in sincerity
and friendship if it did not frankly
impress upon de facto government
that the execution of the threat will
lead to the gravest consequences."
Summary Wired to Rodgers.
The note was handed earlv todav
to Elesio Arredondo, the Mexican
ambassador designate here for trans
mission to Mexico City. Copies were
furnished to all the foreign embas
sies and legations, and a summary
cabled to Special Agent Rodgers at
the Mexican capital for his Informa
tion. In addition to refusing to withdraw
the troops and warning that execution
of the threat to attack them will be
followed by the gravest consequences,
the note serves notice that as long as
the Carranza forces continue their
present attitude, no arms or ammuni
tion or machinery for their manu
facture will be permitted to reach
Mexico from the United States.
Secretary Baker, busv at the war
department all morning with details
of the mobilization oi the national
guard for border defense duty, went
10 tne wmte House a few minutes be
fore the other members for tnstav'm
cabinet meeting for a private confer
ence with the president.
rrom .special Agent Rodgers at
Mexico City, the state department
heard that arrangements were being
made to run a special train from the
capital to Vera Cruz to bring out
Americans and other foreigners. There
are upwards of 1.200 Americans in
Mexico City. Mr. Rodgers's report
told of anti-American demonstrations
and other disorders.
Hold I'p Foreign Service BilL
Administration leaders in congress
decided not to seek immediate action
oc a resolution to provide for nukiic
the national guard eligible for foreign
service, fearing that such a -jep tt
this time might be construed by ih-i
Mexican government as a warlike aeu
Enough regulars are available now to
deal with any emergency across the
Mexican border and if it should be
come necessary to send in guardsmen
the resolution then could he rushed
throught later.
' Long continued outrages against
Americans ana tneir property both in
Mexico and on American soil .re re
viewed in the note and warning given
that the troops will be kept in Mex
ico until such a time as the de facto
government performs the duty whim
the United States has not sought, of
pursuing the bandits who ought to be
arrested and punished by the Mexican
government.
United States Cannot Rrcede.
"While this government would deep
ly regret such a result." says the note,
"it cannot recede from its settled de
termination to maintain its national
rights and to perform its full duty in
preventing further invasion of the ter-
Jrltory of the United States and in re
moving the peril which Americana
along the international boundary have
borne so long with patience and for
bearance." "I am reluctant to be forced to the
conclusion which might be drawn
from the circumstances." Secretary
Lansing declares, "that the de facto
government in spite of the . crimes
committed and the sinister designs of
Villa and his followers, did not and
does not now intend or desire that
these outlaws should be captured, de
stroyed or dispersed by American
troops, or, at the request of this gov
ernment by Mexican troops."
