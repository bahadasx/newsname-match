I . . .

COAST MOBILIZATION PROMPT.
SAN FRANCISCO, June 20. National guardsmen up and
down the Pacific ceast began today to assemble at the vari
ous mobilization camps in response to the president's call for
men for service on the Mexican border.
About 10,000 militiamen in California, Oregon, Washington,
Montana and Idaho will be mobilized within three or four days.
All are ready and eager to entrain for the south.
The Washington guardsmen will concentrate at American
Lake on Wednesday or Thursday. The Oregon guardsmen be
gan mobilizing at Clackamas range today.
WASHINGTON, June 20. Secretary of State Lansing today
published the text of the note which was sent to Carranza flatly
refusing the demands of the de facto head for the withdrawal of
United States troops from Mexico. It is the curtest note that
Wilson has yet sent.
The note threatens "the gravest consequences" if the Mexi
cans attack the Americans.
It excoriates Carranza's failure to cooperate and resents the
bruskness of Carranza's demands.
The note states : The de facto government has been pleased
to ignore its obligation to protect American rights or chase ban
dits, believing that in the case of a refusal by the United States
to retire its troops there would be no further recourse than to
defend Mexican territory by an appeal to arms. The United
States would surely be lacking in sincerity and friendship if it
did not impress upon the de facto government the fact that an
execution of this threat will lead to the gravest consequences.
The note bluntly informs Carranza that he cannot recede
from the settled determination to maintain national rights and
prevent further raids across the boundary. The note charges
that the bandits have gone unhampered and unpunished. It
recites a score of instances. It charges Carranza with indif
ference and even with hating encouraged the bandits. It re
sents the discourteous tone of Carranza's last note.
The note begins: "I have read
your communication on the presence
of American troops in Mexico and I
would be wanting in candor if I did
not. before answering, express the
surprise and regret It has caused this
government by the discourteous tone
and temper of the last communication
of the de facto government.''
The note then reviews the three
years of bloodshed and civil war. It
details the attacks, on Brownsville.
Red House ferry, Progresso and Las
Aspeladas on last September, declar
ing that Carranzista adherents and
even soldiers, participated in the loot
