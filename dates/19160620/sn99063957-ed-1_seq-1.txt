Mexico City, June 20. The Mexi
can capital awaits today with "tense
interest the arrival of the American
note. Arrangements have been mado
to flash a digest, of its contents to all
important cities of the republic as
noon as it can be translated.
No responsible official would com
ment on advance reports of the nature
of 1'resident Wilson's reply. Officials
jenerally expressed tlio hope that the
United states would meet fully Gen
oral Carranza 's demand for a with
drawal of tho American forces, or at
least express a willingness to negotiate
for their early retirement.
Publican of early dispatches re
porting that President Wilson mobiliz
ed the militia only to guard the bor
der has created a good impression
liere. On the other hand, certain Mex
ican leaders have openly questioned
president Wilson's good faith, assert
ing that the presence of heavy artil
lery with General Pershing's army is
proof that the object of the expedition
was not the suppression of banditry,
but the conquest of Mexican territory.
Pntriotic demonstrations begun at
noon yesterday continued until an ear
ly hour today. The militia patrolled
tho principal streets to prevent anti
foreign outbrenks.
It is estimated that between six
hundred and seven hundred Americans
fire now in Mexico City. Arrange
ments are being made today for" a
r-pecial train to carry all who choose
to leave to Vera Cruz.

of here on the Rio Grande, where it
is reported that 1,500 Mexicans and
Vnqui Indians are approaching the.
city irom tlie south. Reports of the
cilvaii. e were brought to Del Rio bv
Mexicans and transmitted to General
I'unstou by General Sibley, command
ing at that plnce.
General Greene, commanding the

talion of the Third infantry oi motor

leoeipt of the information. Sibley's
command is of fair strength and with
the reinforcements he should be able
to defend the city against the Mexi
cans and laqins in case they attack,
according o Fun.ston.
The presence of the Yarmis so near
toe border is taken as confirmation of
the recent report that the governor of
( oahuila has sent a band of iudians
iuirth to attack Del K'o. Aparently
tiie indians formed a junction with a
Mexican force and the two bodies are

force was last reported about forty
miles south of Del Hio and should ar
rive opposite the city today.

FOR 30 MOREMEN
.umpany M Needs That Number-Lieutenant
Allen at
Armory to Get Them
Salem is called on to furnish thirty
more men for service in Company M.
Lieutenant Dana II. Allen is in charge
of recruiting headquarters at tho
armory with orders to remain in this
city until tho men required to bring
the company up to full war strength
are secured.
The enlisted strength of the organ
isation is now 129. The addition of
thirty will nuke more than the number
desired. However, there are manv in
the company who have applied" for
transfers to some other arm of the.
service.
Several physicians are Included in
the personnel and these will probably
be transferred to the hospital corps in
the event of active service. It is to
take care of deficiencies made in this
manner that more men are needed.
The recruiting office will be onen
from seven in the morning until ten
o'clock every night. In a city of
18,000, Lieutenant Allen feels, there
ought to be no difficulty in getting the
thirty men desired. Appreciation of
the spirit which prompted those who
enlisted since Sunday, when the call
came, is voiced by Allen.
There yet remains something to do
iu this line, lie adds. To those who en
list will be given an opportunity to sep
considerable of life. The experience
received during even a short term of
service with the troops cannot be
valued too highly. Prospective re
cruits, declares the lieutenant, should
bear in mind ihe fact that they will be
under no expense whatever in joining
the colors. Clothing, food, shelter and
medical attendance are furnished free
and to this is added a liberal salary.
Kvervthing considered, a man in the
army receives a salary as great ns the
average man working for a weekly
wage in civil life.
As soon as three or four men are
signed up they will sent to Clackamas
where they will receive equipment and
take instruction.
Since yesterday the following men
have enlisted: George P. Downing,
Charles C. Munson, John IhiKette,
George Lee Tuel, John A. Hess, Hnny
Kdwin Fraser, Elmer Dean Cook, Mar
tin F. Van Laanen, George Cole, Alva
Lee McDonald, and Hugh A. M. Martin.
Tor every man who goes to the
polls to vote for somebody, probubly
five men go to vote against somebody.

If the threat is carried out, American
and Cnrranzista forces will clash. Up
on learning from friendly Mexicans
that the bandits were operating to the
south and west of Namiquipa, Pershing
immediately sent two detachments of
cavalry iu pursuit. The American troops
trampled over Carranza 's "dead

Pershing arranged to support these
detachments with heavy reinforcements
should they be attacked. He is ulso

NOTE E ITE R
LONG SUFFERING
FROM BANDIT ACTS
Charges Carranza With Indif
ference To Atrocities
of Raiders
HE SHIELDED OUTLAWS
INSTEAD OF PUNISHING
And Ends by Telling Him He
Will Be Threshed If He
Misbehaves
Washington, June 20, The American
government today threatened General
Carranza with "the gravest conse
quences" if ho attacks American
troops now in Mexico.
This threat was contained in a long
note replying to his last withdrawal
demand. Full of short &Tm diplomatic
jabs, the noto positively declined to
take tho American forces out of Mex
ico. It excoriated Carranza for his
failure to cooperate and resented his
bruskness and his intimations of bad
faith.
"The de facto government is pleased
to ignore this obligation (to protect
American rights and chase bandits),"
said the note, "and to believe that, in
case of a refusal to retire the troops,
there is no further recourse than to
defend its territory by an appeal to
arms, for the government of the United
States would surely be lacking in sin
cerity and friendship if it did not
frankly impress upon the de facto
government that, tbp execution of his
threat will lead to the. gravest conse
quences.' 1
Bluntly the note told Carranza that
this government "cannot recede from
its settled determination to maintain
its national rights" and to prevent
further raids ncross the boundry.
The high lights of tho note were:
Resentment of Carranza 's discourte
ous tone, and temper in his last note.
Charges that bandits have gone un
hampered and unpunished iu attneking
Americans.
Recitation of scores of instances of
banditry.
Charges that the Carranza regime
had been indifferent to ntrocities and
even encouraged and aided Borne of the
leaders of these.
Charges that Carranza did not take
prper steps to apprehend Villa and
others.
The Note to Mexico.
"The secretary of state to the secre
tary of foreign relations of the de
facto government of Mexico:
"Department ot State,
"Washington, June 20, HUG.
"Sir: I have read your communica
tion, which was delivered to me on
May 22, 101(1, under instructions of the
chief executive of the de facto govern
ment of Mexico on the subject of the
presence of American troops iu Mexican
territory, and I would be wanting in
candor if I did not, before making ans
wer to the allegations of fact and the
conclusions reached by your govern
ment, express the surprise and regret
which have been caused this govern
ment by the discourteous tone and tem
per "of this last communication of the
de facto government of Mexico.
"The government of tho United
States has viewed with deep concern
and increasing disappointment the pro
gress of the revolution iu Mexico. Con
tinuous bloodshed and disorders have
marked its progress. For three years
the Mexican republic has been torn
with civil strife, tho lives of Ameri
cans and other aliens have been sacri
ficed; vast properties developed by Am

destroyed und rendered non-productive;
bandits have been permitted to roam

to return there to protect their inter

have neither been apprehended nor
brought to justice.
Deplorable Conditions.
"ft would be difficult to find in the
annals of the history of Mexico condi
tions more deplorable than those which
have existed them during these recent
years of civil war."
The note frankly states, "it would
be tedious to recount instance alter

ity after atrocity." It docs mention,
however, specific cases.

Lower California is about to

itself a republic, according to
' rumors current here today. The
story is gaining credeuco and

Conditions are declared by

all is peaceful, the treasury is

Austrian force in all probability will ba
cm on ana surrounaoa. The others
face tho alternative of retreating
throuirh the Carpathian passos, abandon
ing their guns or crossing into Ku
mnnia. General Pflanzcr, commanding tho
Anstrians around Czernowitz, is retreat
ing southward in the direction of the
Sereth river with his beaten forces.
How many AuBtrians escaped westward
planning Inter to join Bothnia's army,
is not yet known.
Practically tho whole Russian front
north of Czcrnowitz is steadily press
ing in upon Lcmborg. It is repqrteil
that measures have already been taken
for tho evacuation of tho Galician.cap
ital. Russian troops pressing down up
on Brody in the advance upon Lemberg
may already have crossed the Galieian
'frontier.
It is admitted here that the Aus
trian defense is becoming more 'stub
born. Fast of Brody and on wide
front directly east of Lemberg the Aus
trinns are counter nttneking with the
greatest spirit, using flame . ejectors
and largo quantities of sholls. Both
on the Brody front and further south,
Austriun prisoners have been captured
who admit they Were rushed into1 action
a few days ago from the Italian front.
That the Russian offensivo not only,
arrested the Austrinn drive southward
into Italy, but frustrated an ambitious
scheme of tho Austrb-German general
staffs for the conquest of southern Rns
siu was indicated by Bucharest dis
patches today. These reports said it had
been learned from German sources that
an Austro-Germun thrust across south
ern Rusia to the Hindi sen ni in f,.l.
low the Austrian offensive in Italy, the
plan being to cut Russia off entirely
from tho Balkan states. If this report
is true, the Russians strategists out
witted the enemy.
The latest reports indicate that from
half to two-thirds of the Anstrians
facing the Russians when the offensive
began were killed, wounded or mndo
prisoners early in the fighting. Tha
soldiers wcro so badly disorganized that
the Russians pushed forward with tho
greatest rapidity. Only the arrival of
fresh bodies of Austrian troops check
ed tho momentum of General Brusiloff '
rush.
The military experts here, though
not attempting to minimise tho imporV
nnce,f the present Russian operations,
advise, the public to restrain its pnthuv
iasin f"r bigger events expected very
soon.
