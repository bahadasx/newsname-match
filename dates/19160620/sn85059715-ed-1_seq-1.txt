Booster week In the Telegram's
10,000 Club is a busy one. Votes
are coming in daily and the interest
In the catnpnign is increasing by
leaps and bounds.
The members of the club realize
that this is a very generous offer in
which they have a chance to create I
a reporve, that they would have to
work hard for later on. While this
week's offer is not us large as that
of last week, it will be the largest
offer in force during the campaign
and it will pay you to work hard now
as the following offers are going to
be smaller each week.
The winner will be determined by
the one who has secured the most
votes and not the one that turns
in the most money. If it is votes:
that you need, why not work the
hardest when you can get votes tho
easiest?
We are adding new members daily
and today's list shows quite a number
of new ones. While these members
did not start at the beginning,
they have as good a showing as any
one. and no one has the car won as
yet. The campaign is barely under
way and there is lots of room for
new members. To you who have not
