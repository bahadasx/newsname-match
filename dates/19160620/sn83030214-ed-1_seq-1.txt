Washington. June 10.?Whether there will be war with

\\ ilson, in a note to be dispatched to-morrow, sternly refuses tn
withdraw Ameriean troops from Mexican soil until the United
States can be guaranteed against further border raids.
Advisen of the President admitted to-night that I 'arranza's
answer might be the opening of hostilities and an .mmediate
attaek on Genenl Pershing's troops. Word /rom across the
border shows preparations for lighting being activeljr pushed
by both government and people.
President Wilson is continuing his plans to face any emer?
gency. Following the calling out ol the militia last night. he
will ask Congresi to-morrow for authority to um them in Mex
i,,,. Under the Hay bill state troops will not pass under Federal
.ontrol for duty outside the I'nited SUtea until after July l.
