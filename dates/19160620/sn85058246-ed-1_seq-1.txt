MOBILIZATION OF
THE UTAH GUARD
ALREADY BEGUN
General E. A. WedQewood Usues
Orders For Each Unit to Go
Into Camp
Salt Lake, June 19. Governor
William Spry nt 11:20 o'clock last
evening received orders front New
ton D. Unker, secretary of war, for
the Immediate mohollzutlou of the
National Guard of Utah for fedeial
service, llefore midnight the order
for mobllizntlru had been commun
icated to tho commanders of the dif
ferent units of tho guard by Adju
tant General E. A. Wedgewood.
Six troops of cavalry and the bat
tery of Held artillery will bo mobil
ized today nt their respectlvo home
stations. Later the guard probably
will be concentrated nt Fort Uoiu
las. In order that nil units may be
nt war strength nt tho enrllest los
slble moment, recruiting offlces will
bo opened todny nt the home station
of each unit.
The recruiting odlce In Salt Lako
will bo opened at a central point In
the down town district, but tho ex
net location was not decided upon
last night. A cavalry troop at war
strength comprises 100 men and a
battery 171.
Call Is Expected
In anticipation of tho call, practi
cally all arrangements for the mob
ilization of the state troops had been
completed by Governor Spry' before
tho receipt of Secretary Baker's or
der. Upon receipt of tho order but
n few moments wero required to
transmit Its contest to the unit com
mander In the form of a general or
d.er from the olllco of Adjutant Gen
eral Wedgwood.
Governoi Spry Inst night expressed
the dcslro to do everything in his
power to aid the president In tho
present crisis. He further express
ed tho hopo that tho response to the
call for recruits would place Utah
Ik tlm frnnt unit Of tllO States IIU.Xl-
ous to answer tho president's call.
Tho national guard of Utah now
Includes seven troops of cavalry, one
battery of Held artillery, u hospital
corps, a quartermaster corps anil a
band. Six troops of cavalry and tho
battery of Held artillery are ordort'd
assembled by Secretary Maker f"i'
muster Into federal service. The Lo
gan troop Is, not Included in tho or
der for the reason that It has been
organized within the past month
und Is without equipment.
Will Agnrenate 800 Men
At tho present time ttio strength
of tho Utah guard 1b between 000
and 700 olllcers and men. Recruit
ed to war strength tho seven units
ordered mobilized for muster Into
federal service will aggregate about
800 officers and men. The entlro
guard organization of tho stnto Is
under tho command of Adjutant Gen
otal E. A. Wedgwood. Mnjor W. G.
Williams Is tho ranking hold olllcor
and probably would command the
cavalry detachment if it should bo
sent to tho Mexican border.
Tho battery nnd troops A and '!
of tho cavalry nro located in Salt
Lako. Troop II Is nt Ogden, troop
E at Kphrnlm, troop F nt Mantt and
troop G and tho band at Mount Plea
snnt. Tho troops nro at present or
ganized on n peace footing, with
from 63 to 70 men each.
With referenco to tho mobilization
orders General Wedgwood paid !ast
night:
From tho toxt of tho order it is
uncertain whether tho medical de
partment Is called Into scrvlco or
not; that is,, tho medical department
attached to troop units. The call Is
for ono squadron and two separate
troops. Four troops of cavalry con
stitute n squadron and tho war .de
partment does not recognize frac
tions of units. It would appear from
tho order that fractions of units may
hereafter bo raised to completo the
units.
Tho call for the six troops of cav
alry means that until such tlmo as
tho two scpnrato troops are raised
to a squadron by tho ndilltion of two
more troops and unless two troops
from another state aro assigned with
the six troops from Utah, that tho
t.lx Utali troops will temporal lly con
utltuto one squadron nnd the Held
CAVALRY TROOP
OF LOGAN WILL ;
NOT HAVE TO GO
Logan vvns thrilled Sunila night
when the word was spread about tho
city that President Wilson through
his secretar.v, had asked Governor
Spry to call out the Utah National
Guard and that Governor Spry had
compiled with the lemiosl. At llrsti
I was not known Just what would
be expected and consequently them
wero "a great many anxious hearts
among the parents of the sons who
recently Joined Cnvnlry Troop H In
this city.
This company ban hardly been or
ganized three weekn unit tor n call
to be made so sudden caused alarm
to be spread oor tho city. Many
of the boys In this troop being un
der nge ( IS jears -and with practi
cally no experience nt all In military
training.
It was later learned .however that
tho Logan troop was not Included in
the call from the fact that It had
not been supplied with equipment
which consists of n boldler's outfit,
bueli as uniform, gun, etc.
However, Captain E. 11. Spencer
was the first to be notified that the
Utah National Guard hod been called
out nnd the courage dlsphied upon
being notllled was typical of that of
every other man that had been mus
tered 'In Sir. Spencer savs that wo
all went Into this proposition with
tho understanding that ir we coidl
bo usid In tho defense of our coun
try we were only too willing to be
In Uncle Sam's sorvico. We all ex
pected that tho troop would prob
ably bo given some uctunl borvlce
but we, did not expect It to be so
soon,s
Among the boys who comprlre
Trooptvjj; -there aro a few who have
had from two to four years training
ut tho Agricultural College. East
man Hatch and Reuben .fousson both
have had training camp experience In
California. Aside from this, Howev
er, nono of tho boys have hnd any
experience, air. apem-ur " u-m-porarlly
chosen as captain of the
troop from the fact that lie has been
orj enthusiastic and that he has
had perhaps more experience than
nnyone elso with n horse,

olllcers will act for the six troopj
tho same as they wopld for 'our.
Logan Not Included
Tho Logan organization Is not In
cluded In tho call for the reason that
It has been organized within the last
month and It has been impracticable
foj the department to furnish equip
ment, using tho term equipment to
comprlso everything required by the
soldier. It must not bo understood,
however, that tho department has
not this equipment on hand. On the
contrary, it has R, but has been un
nblc to lssuo it prior to July I for
tho reason that there wore no funda
available until that date under con
gressional appropriation to which It
could bo charged.
