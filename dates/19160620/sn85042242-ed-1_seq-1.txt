Ferry Boat Gets Beyond Control
Floats at Mercy of
Swift Current
WOMEN CALM AS THE
VESSEL APPEARS LOST
The Missouri appeared ocean-wido
to passengers on the Bull Dog ferry
boat Sunday afternoon when that ves­
sel with engine crank broke in mid­
stream, gave up its rudder and tossed
helplessly for several hours by the
swift current that carried the fright­
ened women and men to Fort Lincoln
before life boats succeeded in getting
them safely ashore.
Two cars were picked up by the
ferry. In one auto were Mr. and Mrs.
C. C. McLean, Mrs. Mary L. McLean
and Miss Elizaibeth Bayliss in the
other, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, Miss
Marie Bentley, Clair Barly and Wil­
liam Zeamer.
Crank Shaft Breaks-
Soon after leaving shore the crank
shaft broke and the craft, beyond con­
trol, floated down stream. The ferry­
man could at this time have easily
have landed the passengers, but he
thought that he could repair the en­
gine. After the boat had battled with
the waves for several hours, and it
seemed that it might go to pieces at
any time, the passengers insisted that
he cut loose the life boat and stop his
efforts to save the vessel and the aut­
omobiles.
Frayne Baker to Rescue.
The first boat load reached shore
safely, but the second capsized. For­
tunately, however, in a few feet of
water. With ruined clothes, the occu­
pants climbed ashore.
Mrs. Mary McLean, in the first boat
load, called Frayne Baker by tele­
phone, and he rescued the men re­
maining with his launch.
The automobiles wire recovered at
3:30 yesterday afternoon.

Tragedy
Waukegon, 111., June 19.—Two tele­

lieved the monotony on the night
watch by "listening in" on the wire,
were unexpectedly produced by the

to- have been:
Orpet—"Hello, Marion. This is
Will. Are you coming out?"
Marion—"No." Ojptjt, pleadingly
•"Oh'! take A chance and come on."
Marion—"I guess 1 have taken
chances enough with you. 1 think my
mother was wise last time 1 was
sick."
Orpet—"I'll give you something to
lix that."
Marion—"No 1 can't."
Orpet—-"Well, all right: I've got to
catch the five o'clock train back to
Madison in the morning."
Information Held Back.
Mrs. Kennedy, who at that, time
was unmarried, and went by her
maiden name of Lihdke, and Miss
Dunn, testified that this conversation
look place about 8 o'clock in the eve­
ning of the 8th. When they read of
the death of Marion, they spoke to
others in the olfice about it, and when
she married. Miss Lihdke told her
husband, but the information did not
reach State's Attorney J. Brady until
last Saturday. He informed attorneys

Russians and more ammunition, ma­

their furher advance.

Petrograd admits the penetration of

the Russians retrieved this setback.
The announcement of lighting in this

Funston Anxiously Awaiting
Slightest Indication of
Any Hostilities
MEXICAN AUTHORITIES
TO JAIL AMERICANS
San Antonio, June 19.—While 100,
000 men were being assembled, Gen.
Funston anxiously studied the border
for any possibilities of attacks by Car­
ranza troops. Along the Rio Grande
from Hrownsville to El Paso, he se­
cured what information was avaTl
able. No information reached he**
that would disturb the delicately bal­
anced relations between the soldiers
of the two countries.
Gen. Pershing's report indicated
that Gen. Trevino had not yet made
any advance move, and army officers
believe it improbable, and that
would not unless Trevino received
special orders from Mexico City.
The concentration of heavy forces
to the south of Juarez also was re­
ported. The only point where con­
centration at a border town was being
effected was at Ojanaga, opposite
Presidio.
Cavalry Forces Busy.
Gen. J. J. Pershing, American ex­
peditionary commander, has cavalry
detachments operating south and west
of the Namiquipa base, in pursuit of
marauders, according to several ap­
parently reliable reports here today.
It was asserted that Gen. Pershing re­
ceived reports of the presence of th
bandits almost simultaneously with
Gen. Jacinto Trevino's warning that
any movement of the American troops
other than toward the border would
be considered a hostile act. Pending
advices from Gen. Frederick Funstrn,
it was said, he gave no orders to give
chase until late yesterday.
Rush Supplies.
WSiile some anxiety was expressed
here over the move, it was not be­
lieved Gen. Trevino would seiz« uifcra
it as an excuse to attack the detach­
ment. It was pointed out the move­
ment was minor and *-ould not af­
fect the expeditionary rorce. A mo­
tor train left yesterday, carrying am­
munition and food to the front. The
trsin carried the largest supplies
since it crossed the border.
According to reiwrt'?. Mexican au­
thorities have ordered able-bodied
Americans taken prisoners an3 intend
to disarm all foreigners in :hc Yaqni

No 'Marching Ordtrc.
While the diplomatic steps were In
progress today, the nation was stir­
ring throughout its width and breadth
about the movement of 0«ti0Q«I
guardsmen mobilizing to guard the
border. At least 100,000 and possibly
a larger number were preparing for
the president's call. For the present,
the mission will be one of defense.
but should war come they would also
be ready for that. 'No marching or­
ders for the new forces have gon«
out tonight. They will not be assign­
ed for border duty until mustered fti
to the federal service.
Even when mobilization is complet­
ed, such units will be ordered south
as Gen. Funston desires to fill the
gaps in his 1800-mile guard line. The
remainder will rest on arms at the
states' mobilization camps for the
present.
Bitter Against United States.
Official reports from many quarters
show that, a flame of popular feeling
against the United States is being kin­
dled throughout Mexico. Apparently
it is being done with the sanction,of
Gen. Carranza, for the act in many
cases are those of his authorized mili­
tary or civil agens.
From Juarez to the wst coast of
Mexico posters have appeared, calling
the people to arms and asserting that
the United Staets is preparing to hurl
its armies into Mexico. Chaotic con­
ditions prevail everywhere! Clashes
such as that between Mexican troops
and American bluejackets at Mazatlan
yesterday show that relations are
strained to the breaking point. The
act of a subordinate commander any­
where may bring on lighting that will
result in war.
So far as officials here are aware.
Gen. Carranza is taking no strong
measures to curb his soldiers and
people. Upon this fact, many of them
found their belief that he is determin­
ed to force matters to ah issue unless
the American troops are withdrawn.
Neither state department officials nor
members of the diplomatic fpr# here
have ben satisfied themselves as to
Carranza's motives.
Clash With Mexican*
A clash betwen Carranza soldiers
and American seamen from the gun­
boat Annapolis, at Matxaplan, waa
called to the attention of the 'Washing­
ton government today by Gen. Car­
ranza's ambassador here, with the re­
quest that in the existing tense situ­
ation, no men be landed in Mexico
from 'American warships under' any
circumstances.
The incidents which occurred yes­
terday resulted in casualties on both
sides, in the capture by,the Xexicaas
of two American officers, wbo, after
an explanation, were released* accord*
ing to the report presented by the
ambassador.
A dispatch from Admiral Wtnslow
of the Pacific fleet, announcing the
capture of the men, made no mention
of their release, but the officials as*
sumed it had occurred after the re­
port was received.
Admiral Winslow sent only a brief
account of the incident and amy
cials immediately requested
detailed report Late tonight it
not been received.
