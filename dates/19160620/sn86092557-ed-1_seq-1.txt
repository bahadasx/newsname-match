GENERAL FISSION ASKS FOR fillUM
Concent' ation of Citizen Soldiery Is Going on In All the
States and Troop Movements Will
Soon Begin.
(By Associated Press.>
WASHINGTON, June 20?With President Wilson's
firm refusal to withdraw the American troops from Mex
ico on its way to the de facto government embodied in a
note firmly arraigning the whole course of General Car
ranza in the situation which had brought the two countries
to the verge of war, the administration continued today
its preparation to meet any emergency that may arise.
War or peace rests with General Carranza. The position
of the Unted States is pointedly set forth in its review of
the apparent liability of Carranza to prevent border raids
and to keep the obligation he owes the world by the pres
ervation of order in his dominion.
Copies of the note were furnished to all foreign embas
sies and legations and a summary cabled to Special Agent
Rodgers at the Mexican capital for his information;
FUNSTON REQUISITIONES GUARDSMEN. j
SAN ANTONIO, June 20?General Funston today re
quested the War Department to send him as soon as possi
ble a large part of tne National Guardsmen to be station
ed along the Mexican boundary from Brownsville to the
Pacific Ocean.
General Funston did not make public the exact number
requested but said he had asked for enough to provide
"adequate protection" of the border.
He also withheld the name of the station to which the
gitardsmen would be sent, althoufjh admitting that a con
siderable force would be mobilized at San Antonio as re
serves.

UNTIL CARRANZA
CAN DOIS DUTY
"Gravest Consequences" will

(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON', June 2.?The Amer
lean note flatly rejecting General Car
ranza's demand for the withdrawal of
United States troops from Mexico and
rebuking the Carranza government for
the discourteous tones and temper of
Its last communication was handed to
day to EUsco Arredondo, Mexican am
bassador designate.
Long continued outrages against
Americans and their property both in
Mexico and on American soil are re
viewed in the note and warning ab
given, that the troops will be kept in
Mexico until such a time as the de
facto government performs the duty
which the United States has not
sought.
It concluded with the statement that
if the de fapto government continues
to ignore this obllgatio nand carries
out its threat to defend its territory
by an appeal to arms against the Amer
ican troops, the gravest consequences
rirttl follow. "While this government
would deeply regret such a result"
Bays the note "it cannot recede from
Its settled determination to maintain
gaatibiial rights and perform its full
;Muty?in preventing further invasion of
fthe- teritory of the U. S. and in
removing the peril which the Amert-!
cans along the international bouna

and forebearance, "I am reluctant to
be forced to the conclusion which
might be drawn from circumstances"

Hunger Driving Peons Into
the Ranks of the De
Facto Army.
(By Associated Press)
EL PASO, June 20.?Hunger is
swelling the array that Gen. Carran
za is recruiting in northern Mexico
in preparation for possible hostilities
with the United States according to
stories brought here today by Amer
icans arriving from there.
Peons who for some time have been
on the verge of starvation havo been
flocking to his standard in the last few
days in return for promises of food
and clothing they said. No applicants
have been rejected, according to sto
ries which told of boys of 10 and 12
years ol age and old men being re
crulted.
One of the arrivals, an American
business man of Mexico City estimated
that there are now 25,000 Carranza
troops in Chihuahua state of whom
about 2000 are in Chihuahua City, 4000
in Juarez and 5000 in Villa Ahumada
the northern Chihuahua base which is
93 miles south of El Paso. The re
mainder practically surround the
American expeditionary command on
the southeast and west He said also
that soveral thousand troops which
had been at Chihuahua recently were
sent toward San Antonio and Madera
ostensibly to be stationed along the
mine of the Mexican Northwestern
railroad southwest of General Persh
ing's command.
The refugees brought with them
graphic stories of economic condi
tions. One man said that he and fel
low passengers would have starved
had not the train stopped at times
long enough to allow them to get out
and eat raw boans from the fields.
The Mexicans are desperate, a refugee
from the Elvalle district said. "Even
though their attitude otherwise might
be friendly hunger is apt to force them
to attack an American supply train.
Marion Co, Court

RECOUNT WAS RECOUNTED BE
FORE THE RESULT WAS
SATISFACTORY.
Although the first re-count of the
Republican vote for governor in Ma
rlon county was completed Friday yet
the ofTilcal result was not decided un
til yesterday ovenlng.
A partial re-count of' the re-count
was made yesterday byi.the court on
the motion of Attorney Fuller Glass
cock representing the interests of /A.
A. Lilly. In two precincts where the
number of ballots was different from
the number of voters listed on the poll
books the affirmation books of the
party were resorted to ' and after
checking up.from these -four.votes in
Union district precinct. No. 2 were
thrown out. One of those was a Lilly
vote and three were for Robinson. In
Fairmont' district precincts No. 10, the
affirmation book and the "ballots check
ed correctly.
This completes the. work of the
canvassing board in this county and
the result will be certified to the sec
retary of state at once. This gives
Robinson a gain of 14 votes instead of
the 16 net gain anounced .Friday, whdn
the first re-count was finished.

First Regiment Will Soon

Company.

Regardless of the fact that the First
regiment N. 0., WI 'Va. has not been
called for duty on the Mexican bor
der, ilie two Fairmont companies have
been deluged with application for
members-hip. Many whose time had
expired and who have- been counted
out have- trailed both Captain Francis
Thralls and Captain- Edward. Carskad
dori for the past two days to get them
selves back, into harness, again.
Those who ra-enlist now only have
to do so for two years.. It is for this
reason that they desiroto becom*
guardsmen: before July :1. After July
1 both new men and re-enlistments
call for six-year , terms each. The
guardsmen figure that they can lick
Mexico within the two years and that
they should enlist now.
A8 both Fairmont companies are
mustered 'to-more than their minimum
number'there is "every reason to be
lieve that when they are called if such
time comes within 'the; next' few weekB
both company H and company I will
leave Fairmont, at maximum strength.
As thfc most of the guards were
slightly'ruffled yesterday because they
were not allowed to partake in the ma

cool their tempers. In an effort to do
this. Congressman M. -M.? Neely at

to see if both regiments could not be
called out. This, according 'to the
Congressman was impossible' as plans
