"A boat from the warship ap-j

warned to keep off until permission I
to land could be obtained from the
military authorities. It went back toi
the ship and several hours later re-:
turned with its crew armed. The of-1

for landing had not been given and an
argument ensued. A crowd of sol-,

the wharf and in the midst of the
discussion a drunken Japanese fired
a shot at the Americans, who prompt-
ly replied with a. vollery into the
crowd. Carranza skddicrs returned
the fire and the boat withdrew, leav-

the American officers were released,
