President Wilson
Call For
Wanted For Sorvic
On Mexican Border,
TOTAL FORCE 145,000
Would Assure Complete Protec
tion For All Americans,
NOT LIKELY TO INVADE MEXICO
Secretary cf War Baker. Issues State
ment to the Effect That the Na
tional Guard Will Be Sent to the
Border Wherever General Funston
Determines the Men to Be Needed.
Washington Regards Movement as
First Step Toward Actual Inter
vention. Washington, June 19. President
Wilson has called out the militia of
every state for service on the Mexi
can border.
In announcing the president's deci
sion Secretary Baker said the militia
would he sent to the border wherever
and as fully as General Funston de
termines them to be needed.
The adjutant general of every stale
has just been notified 'to have his
troops ready for immediate move
ment. Secretary of War Baiter Issued a
statement in which he says: "In
view Df the disturbed conditions on
the Mexican border, and In order to
assure complete protection for all
Americans, the president has called
out substantially all the state militia
and will spnd them to tho border,
wherever aud as fully as General
Funston determines them to be need
ed for the purpose stated. If all are
not needed an effort will be made to
relievo those on duty there from time
to time, so as to distribute the duty.'"
This call for militia is wholly un
related to General Pershing's expedi
tion and contemplates no additional
entry Into Mexico, except as may be
necessary to pursue bandits who at
tempt outrages on Americans. The
military are being called out so as to
leave some troops in tho several
states. They will be mobilized at their
homo stations, where necessary re
cruiting can bo done.
Brigadier General Alfred Mills,
chief of tho division of militia affairs,
estimated the minimum roilita force
to be called out to be 145,000 men.
In army circles the opinion was ex
pressed that If the Mexicans attempt
any aggression General Funston will
need all of the national guard to de
fend the border, owing to tho tre
mendous stretch of tho International
boundary line.
General Pershing, with headquar
ters at Namiqulpa, Is believed to bav
sufficiently established himself to
rercome any -force that may attack
him.
First Step of Intervention.
Although the purpose of the action
as set forth in the call la for the pro
tection of the frontier from lnva
Blon. the opinion prevailing through
out Washington is that It merits the
first step of intervention in Mexico,
For more than three years President
Wilson has exhausted every other ex
pedient, particularly in an effort to
avoid sucn a step.
The action is understood to have
been precipitated by a dispatch from
General Funston predicting trouble
all along th,e Rio Grande in an effort
on the part of the Mexicans to force
the Americans to withdraw from Mex
ican soil.
Although every state In tho Union
and the District of Columbia Is af
fected by the call, not all of the or

ganizations of each state is called
out None of the coast artillery units
of the national guard Is affected.
According to the Inst reports of tho
division of militia affairs of the war
department the "paper" strength of
the entire national guard, exclusive
of coast artillerv, was something
over 117,000 enlisted men. The total
number of enlisted men called for In
tho summons, exclusive of signal
corps and medical corps, is 93,iil8, di
vided as follows: "Infantry, 76.115;
cavalry, 6.435; field artillery, 9,028,
and enginpers, 3,040.
Mexican Embassy Alarmed.
The gravest concernjs manifested nt
the Mexican embassy,' where the fear
was expressed that the action taken
means "the beginning of the end.''
T;ie embassy received a personal tel
egram from General Carrnnza ashing
tho status of conditions in Washing
ton and Indicating that he was totally
In the dark as to the steps talten by
the president. The telegram added,
however, that there appeared to bo a
state of more or less excitement
throughout the northern states of
Mexico in the vicinity of the border,
and Carranza stated that at Mexico
City the cause of the disturbance was
not known.
Kllseo Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador designate, wired in reply, giv
ing the full details of the action of
the president and indicating that it
manutfested a determination on the
part of the administration to talte
drastic steps to suppress the Incur
sions Into American territory.
Call Issued Under Dick Law.
Olllcials of the war department said
the state troops will be kept at their
respective mobilization centers, sub
ject to the call of General Funstou,
and will be sent to him as nueded.
Before any can be sent, however the
formal call makes it plain that all or
ganizations and units muster! Into
the federal service will have to be
re.'rulte'l up to their minimum ncace
btreng'h, which means a mlmrrum of
C" enlisted men to each company of
infantry and engineers, and each
troop of cavalry, and 13C men to each
battery of Held artillery. It is ex
pected that In the first instance not
more than two-thirils of the enlisted
streneth of the otganizntlons called
out will respond, nnd that several
mon'hif at least will be requ'ed to
recruit tlc'ii up to peace strngf- and
equip then; for service in tho fie d.
The "all wbb issued under the old
Dick law, the new army reorganiza
tion bill not having become fully effec
tive. Consequently, enlisted men of
the national guard who fall to re
spond will be subject to prosecution
under the nick law in the same man
ner in which tho 116 men of the Tox
as national guard, already called out,
who failed to respond, are being
courtmartialed. It is expected, how
ever, that by the time the mobiliza
tion gets under way the i.ov army
reorganization bill, which federalizes
the state militia under a double oath
of allegiance to their respective states
and to the president of the United
States, will have become operative.
Warships Sent to Mexico.
Washington, June 19. Orders were
issued for the Pacific fleet to leave at
once for Mexican wncers. In addition,
four warships and 'hree dostroyera
will be rushed to Mexican ports on

Is More Ten3e.
Colonia Dublan, Mexico. Juno 19.
Civilian natives in San Diego and
other towns in the Casas Grandes dis
trict are being armed by the Carranza
garrison commanders In anticipation
of hostilities with General Pershing's
men. ' "More tense." was the laconic
expression from General Pershing
describing the situation.
Heavy guards are being maintained
around the earnp here, although Amer
icans are confining their movements
at present to reconnolterlng along the
line of communication. General Per
shing will not hesitate to send his
columns east and west In case he con
siders his flanks imperiled. Such a
movement, which would be made sole

No alarm Is felt here over the report

AUSTRIAHS EVACUATE TOWN
Fate cf Bukowlna Capital Sealed
When the Russians Storm the
Bridgehead Austrian Forces Retire
to Safer Positions and Engagement
Continues Germans Deliver Coun
ter Blow to Buslloff's Center.
London, June 19. Czernowltz, cap
ital of the Austrian crownland, Buko
wlna, fell Into the hands of the Rus
sians, after one of the most furious
battles of tho war, lasting more than
a week.
"The enemy entered Czernowltz.
We evacuated the town," reads the
official admission of the Austro-Huu-garian
war office in its report.
The fate of the city was scaled
when the ' Russians stormed the
bridgehead on the left bank of the
Pruth Saturday afternoon. At this
bridgehead, the scene of many previ
ous hattles In the present war, Au3-tro-Hungarlan
detachments have been
rendering the most stubborn resist
ance ever since the Russians attacked
it, more than a week ago, after bat
tering down the minor fortifications
on the le't bank of tho Pruth. Evi
dently the heroic detachments de
fending the bridgehead held out until
the garrison of Czernowltz and the
bulk of the Austro-Hungarian right
wing had retired to safer positions,
leaving behind an empty town and
rear guard fighters doomed to sure
death or surrender.
Petrograd announces officially that
with the capture of the bridgehead
more than 1,000 prisoners were taken,
adding that "guns were captured in
Czernowltz," thus supporting the the-"
ory that the garrison escaped.
, Austrian Statement.
The Austrian official version of the
bridgehead's capture by the Ruans
says: "Our troops occupying Czerno
wltz were compelled to retire before
the concentrated fire of a greatly su
perior enemy." During the night. It
is added, the Russians forced passage
of the troops at various points and
entered the town.
The Russian war office asserts that
although the Teutons are "desperate
ly resisting " and are making "furious
counter attacks," Genc-al Brusiloff's
offensive continues without check.
Apart from the capture of Czerno
wltz. however, Petroprad gives no
specific data. Indicating any sain of
further ground.
The statement says a violent battle.
is in progress on the Styr. where th"s
far 2,070 prisoners. Including 70 offi
cers, have been counted. Signs of an
Austro-German offensive on tho
Strypa In the southeastern strip ot
Galicia proper are contained in the
Russian official statement.
A counter blow dealt to General
Brusiloff's center in the region be
tween Lutsk nnd Kovel, where prog
ress for the Russians new Is essential
to secure the southern wing against
a flank attack, is reported by the Ger
man war office. In this sector, Ber
lin asserts, 5,446 Russian soldiers and
11 officers were captured, as well as
some cannon aud 10 machine guns.
This constitutes the most substantia)
success thus far attained by the Teu
tons In their efforts to stem the Mus
