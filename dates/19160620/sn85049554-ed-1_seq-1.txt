It was thiese reports, together with

May Blockade All Ports.
The possibility of a blockade the
state department refuses to discuss for
publication. At the same time some at
tention must be paid to the solemn
declaration of a congressman who as
serta he was told by a state depart
ment official that a blockade of all
Mexican ports will be ordered within
three days.
The congressman went' to the de
partment to protest against the action
of a Carraffza consul aV'New "Orleans
in seeking to collect an assessment of
$2 a bale upion a large shipment of cot
ton from that point to Vera Cruz.
The member of the house was in
formed that "everything was off" with
Mexico. The official told him that It
made no differenec whether the cotton
left New Orleans or not that it would
never reach Vera Cruz. He added tha^
there would be a blockade that would
keep everything from entering or leav
ing Mexico.
CARRANZA CAN MASS IQQ.OOa
Force Would Include Present Bandits
In Field.
New York, June 20.—If General Car
ranza called hiB entire federal army
into service against^ the United States
he would not have more than 62,000
men. This was the estimate furnish
ed the United States war department
at the time of the Vera Cruz troubles,
and there has not been much of an In
crease since then.
However, of the thousands of irreg
ulars in Mexico, including bandits,
many undoubtedly would flock to Car
ranza in the event of war with the
United States, which would give him
an army of probably more than twice
the size of bis federal force.
Most of the federal troops were
quartered in Mexico City, Guadalajara,
T&mplco, Zacatecas, Mazatlan, Listilal,
Guananjuato, Acapulco, Victoria Val
lea and Puebla until March of this
year, when the general northern move
ment toward the Arizona border slow

VOLUME FORTY-TWO /MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, TUESDAY, JUNE 20, 1916.
Washington, June 20.—The American

Text of Note.
The note follows:
The Secretary of State to the Secre
tary of Foreign Relations of the de
facto Government of Mexico—tDepart
meat pf £tate, Washlngton,„p.jC., June
20, iiii.—I have read your communi
cation delivered to me May 22, 1918,
under instructions of the chief execu
tive of the de facto government of Mex
ico on the subject of the presence of
American troops in Mexican territory
and I would be wanting in candor if"I
did not, before making afiswer to the
allegations of fact and the conclusions
reached by your government, express
the surprise and regret which has been
caused this government by -the dis
courteous tone and temper of this last
communication of the de facto govern
ment of Mexico.
The government of the United States
has viewed with deep concern the pro-
grcss of the revolution in Mexico. Con
tinuous bloodshed and disorders have
marked its progress.
Atrocity After Atrooity.
It would be tedious to recount In
stance after Instance, outrage after out
rage, atrocity after atrocity, to illus
trate the true feature and extent of the
widespread conditions of lawlessness
and violence which have prevailed.
During the past nine months in partic
ular the frontier of the United States
along the Rio Grande has been thrown
into a state of constant apprehension
and turmoil because of frequent in
cursion into American'territory.
American garrisons have been at
tacked by night. American soldiers
killed and their horses and equipment
stolen. The attacks on Brownsville,
Red House Ferry, Progreso postoffice
and Las Peladas are typical. In these
attacks on American territory, Carran
za adherents and even Carranza soldiers
took part in the looting. Not only were
these incursions attended by ruthless
brutality but uncivilized acts of mutil
ation were perpetrated.
Promiaea Unfulfilled.
Notwithstanding representations made
to General Carranza and promises of
General Nafarette to prevent attacks
along the international boundary in the
month of October, a passenger train
was wrecked by bandits and several
persons kilfed, seven miles north of
Brownsville, and an attack was made
on United States troops at the same
place several days later.' iSince these
attacks the bandits have been enjoy
ing with impunity the liberty of the
northern towns of Mexico. The indif
ference of the de facto goVernment has
gone so far that some of these leaders,
as I arh advised, have received not only
the protection of that government, but
encouragement and aid as well.
'Depredations on Americans' property
in Mexico have been more numerous.
On Jan. 3 troops were requested to
punish the bands of outlaws which
looted the Cusl mining property, eighty
miles west of Chihuahua, but no ef
fective results came from this request.
No Effort to Cheek Villa.
During the following week the ban
dit Villa was between Rubio and San
Ysabel, a fact well known to Carranza
authorities. On Jan. 10 a train was
stopped by \ttlla bandits and eighteen
Americans were stripped of their
clothes and shot in cqld blood In what
is known as the "Santa Tsabel mas
sacre." A month after this slaughter
of innocent Americans It was notor
ious that Villa was within two miles
of Cusihuiria Chico and publicly stated
that his business was to destroy Amer
icans and property. He was not inter
cepted nor were his iQ?v«fi»ntg stopped
by troops of the de faoto govern nient.
Tbe Mexican authorities were fully
cognisant of this, for on If arch «, as

other punitive expedition similar to
that then in Chihuahua. American
troops crossed Into Mexico on May 10
upon word to the local military authori
ties, under repudiated agreement of
March 10-13, or in any event in ac
cordance with the practice adopted
over forty years ago, when there was
ho agreement ^regarding pursuit of
marauders across the International
boundary. These troops went 168 miles
into Mexico territory in pursuit of the
Glenn Springs bandits, without meet
ing a detachment of Mexican troops or
a single Mexican soldier.
Jockeying at Conference.
During the continuance* of the K1
Paso conference General Scott, you as
sert, did not take ii\to consideration the
plan proposed by the Mexican govern
ment for the protection of the frontier
by the reciprocal distribution of troops
along the boundary. This proposition
was made by General Obregon a'everal
times, but each time conditioned upoa
the immediate withdrawal and the
Mexican conferees were Invariably in
formed that immediate withdrawal
could not take place and that, there
fore, it was impossible to discuss the
project on that basis.
I have noted the fact that your com
munication is not limited to a discus
sion of the deplorable condition exist
ing along the border, but that an ef
fort is made to connect it with other
things in order to support, if possible,
a mistaken interpretation of the atti
tude of the government of the United
States towards Mexico. You say. in ef
fect, that the American government has
placed every obstacle in the way of at
taining the pacification of Mexico.
Every Possiblo Aid.
tn reply to this sweeping charge, I
can truthfully affirm that the American
government has given every possible
encouragement to the de facto govern
ment in the pacification and rehabilita
tion of Mexico. From the moment of
its recognition it has had the undivided
support of this government. An .em
bargo was placed on arms and ammu
nition going into Chihuahua, Soaora,
and lower California in order to pre
vent them falling into the hands of
the armed opponents of the de facto
government. I am surprised that the
de facto government has construed dip

quests by the United States and with
out apparent recognition on its part of
the desirability of putting an end to
these systematic raids, American forces
pursued the lawless band as far a

of Mexico, if a denial is needed that
this government l\as had ulterior mo
tives in its diplomatic representations,

American sympathizers and the Ameri

to deny it. It is, however, a matter of
Common knowledge that the Mexican
press has been more active than the
•Ajnerican press in endeavoring to ln
fllme the two peoples against each
other and to force the countries into

Hostility Unconcealed.
Candor compels me to ad£. that the
unconcealed hostility of the Subordinate
military commanders of the de facto
government to the American troops en
gaged in pursuing the Villa band, and
the efforts of the de fucto government
to compel their withdrawal from Mex
ico by threats of force instead of by
aiding in the capture of the outlaws,
constitutes a menace to tfle safety of
the United States troops and to the
border peace.
As long as this menace continues and
there is evidence of an intention on the
part of the de facto government io uae
force against the American troops in
stead of co-operation, the government
of the United States will not permit
munitions of war or other manufactures
to be exported from this country to
Mexico.
As to the shelter and supplies of
rebels and conspirators on American
soil, I can state that vigorous efforts
are being made to apprehend and bring
to justice all persons round to be con
spiring to violate the laws of the Unlt-
States by organizing to oppose with
arms the de facfo government.
Shown in True Light.
Having corrected the erroneous
statement of the facts to which I have
adverted, the real situation stands forth
in its true light.
It is admitted that American troops
have crossed the international boundary
in pursuit of the Columbus raiders and
without notice to or the consent of the
de facto government, but the several
protestations on the part of the gov-
erament by the president, by this de
partment*-«nd by other American au-
as to be able to prevent any disorders* tborlties, on the object of the expedition
that would^ endanger- -AmeritSn terri-
tory, a band of Mexicans on^th^ night
of May 6 attacked Glenn Springs, Tex.,
about twenty miles north of the border,
killing American soldiers and citizens,
burning and sacking property and
carrying off two Americans as pris
oners.' Subsequent to this the Mexican
government, as yoii^state,
forth that it wag to'fcapture. de-
stroy or completely disperse the Villa
bands of outlaws, or to turn this duty
over to the de facto government, when
assured that it would be done right, and
has been.carried out in faith by the
United States.
Its efforts, however, have been ob
structed at every point by opposition
fostered by the de facto government
and finally by a demand for the im
mediate withdrawal of the AmericaJi
troops.
Meantime conditions of anarchy in
the border states of Mexi'co were con
tinually getting worse. In view of this
menace of the inactivity of the
Carranza forces, of the lack of co-op
eration in the apprehension of the Villa
bands and of the known encourage
ment and aid given to bandit leaders,
it is unreasonable to expect the United
States to go out with its forces, or to
prevent it entering again when their
presence is the only check on further
bandit outrages, and the only efficient
means of protection of American lives
and homes—safeguards which General

Imputations Denied.
Your government says that the at
ticude of the United States is onn of
insincerity, "distrust and suspicion
towards tho de facto government of
Mexico, and that the Intention of the
United States in sending the troops
into Mexico is to extend its sovereign
ty over Mexican territory.
The government of the United
States, if it had had designs on the
territory of Mexico, would have had
no difficulty in finding, durng this pe
riod of revolution and disorder, many
plausible arguments for Intervention in
Mexican affairs.
Tii-is government has waited month
after month for the consummation of
its hopes and expectation of peace. In
spite'of increased disorder, the United
States has refrained from aggressive
aotion.
In the face of constantly renewed
evidences of the patience and strain of
this government, doubts and suspicions
as to he motives of the government of
the United States are expressed in
your communication of May 22. for
which-I can imagine no purpose but
to impugn the good faith of this gov
ernment, for I find it hard to believe
that such Imputations are not univer
sally known to he without the least
shadow of justification fact.
Results Not Methods.
cuc*.ii*r luctuuu of Stop-
ping raids of this nature is to visit
punishment or destruction on the raid
ers. It Is precisely this plan which
the United States desires to follow
along the border without any. intention
of Infringing upon the sovereignty of
her. neighbor but which, altho obvious
ly advantageous to the de facto gov
ernment It refused to allow or even
countenance. It Is in fact protection
to American lives and property about
which the United^ States is solicitous
and. not the method* or ways in which
that protection shall be accomplished.
If the Mexican government is unwill
ing or unable to give this protection by
preventing its territory from being the
refuge of murderers that does not re
lieve .this government from its duty to
take .all tf\e. steps necessary to safe
guard American citizens on American

American territory with impunity,
when pursued to seek safety across the
Rio Grande, relying on the plea of their
government that the Integrity of the
soil of the Mexican republic must not
be violated. The fact that our,forces
in pursuit of the Glenn Springs ma
rauders went 16S miles Into Mexico
without encountering a-single Carran
zlsta does not show that the Mexican
government is doing "all possible'' to
prevent border raids and thare is every
reason why this government must-take
such preventive meaaurea as it dpems
sufficient.
Duty Is Plain.
The de facto government finally ar
gues that "if the frontier were pro
tected from insurgents from Mexico
there would be no reason for the dif
ficulty:" thus the de facto government
tries to absolve itself from the first
duty of any government, namely, the
protection of life and property. This
is the iluty for which General .'ar
ranza, it must be assumed, initiated
his revolution in Mexico and organized
the present government, and for which
the United States government recog
nized his government as the de facto
government of 'Mexico. Protection 'of
Americans then is the- first obligation
of this government, and in Mexico is,
first, the obligation of Mexico, and,
second, the obligation of the United
States. In securing this protection
along the common boundary the Unit
ed States has a right to expect the co
operation of its neighboring republic:
"fid yet. instead of taking steps to
check or punish invaders the de facto
government demurs, and objects to
measures taken by the United States
The government of the United States
does not wish to state that the de facto
government approves these marauding
attacks.
War if Necessary.
In conclusion the Mexican govern
ment Invites the United States to sup
port its "assurances of friendship with
real and effective- acts," which can be
no other than "the immediate with
drawal of the American troops."
For the reasons I have herein fully
set forth this request of the de facto
government can not be complied with
now. Whenever Mexico will assume
and effectively exercisc its responsi
bility the "HniteiJ^States will oe glad
to have this obligation fulfilled. If, on
the other hand, the de facto govern
ment is pleased to Ignore this obliga
tion and to demand that in case of a
refusal to retire these troops there is
no further course than to defend Its
