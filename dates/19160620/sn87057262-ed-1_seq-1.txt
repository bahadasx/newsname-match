The Chicago regiments, the First

Bntralttment orders to the Chicago

Separate orders were sent to down

WASHINGTON. June 20.—Pessim
ism over Mexican matters predomi
nated In official quarters today.
Even those who had hoped Ameri
can mobilization would tame Mexi
co'* martial spirit were today less
confident that this would be the case.
A stronger feeling was that the mil
itia of the United States may see
Mexican service.
One story was that, the administra
tion expects to bottle up Mexican
ports at once. Officials admitted this
could be done though they did not
admit early today that this Is the an
ticipated course.
The Pacific fleet Is enroute to the
west coast of Mexico other ships
dot both coasts. AH are ready for
action.
Tampico is "the special point men
tioned in blockade discussion.
There, is was said, a blockade could
be laid without hampering the sup
ply of oil for the British fleet from
the fields up the Panuco river. This
supply must not be stopped, officials
say, lest Great Britain and the United
States become Involved In a dispute.
The frank pessimism of Secretary
of State Lansing in his discussion of
Mexico gave affairs a sinister turn
that he has not hitherto admitted.
His note to iCarranza, said to be the
strongest document yet sent south,
was to be made public during the day.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo
was
slated for
a
sing
conference with Lan­
this afternoon. The obect of his
vt9&tW*a. not revealed^ Jt -toe plan*
more effbrts to have
American troops
withdrawn, as some reports said, he
was to be told once and for all this,
now, is Impossible.
Reports of war-like declarations
from Mexican governors, served to
show the trend of affairs, though
they had not come officially here this
forenoon.
One state department message re
vealed that the cost of living has ris
en five hundred per cent in Mexico
City since June .first. For weeks past
chaos has been pictured by consuls.
Much of this Information has been
withheld In the hope that conditions
might take a turn for the better.
One thousand Americans remain in
Mexico City, but many of these are
finally heeding repeated warnings to
leave.
Mobilization In many states pro
ceeded rapidly today. Reports indi
cated that the northern states are In
the best state of preparedness.
Secretary Baker has not yet re
vealed orders to any state to move
to the border, hut with afar more sin
ister move these orders many come
at any time.

MEXICO CITY. June 20.—The Mexi:

NBTVV YORK, Jnne 20.—America

instantenous unanimity, while re

By the end of the week every one
of the 100,000 national guardsmen
requlsioned for service will be in
concentration camps, drilling and
hardening for service wherever need
ed. In many a case this concentra

farewell—goodbyes In which the
tears of fear were mixed with the
laughter of pride.

there will be no difficulty whatever in

Long Note in Reply to Withdrawal Demand is*
an Indictment of Country Lacking
inuLaw and Order.
WASHINGTON, June 20.—The
American government today threat
ened General Carranza with "the
gravest consequence" If he attacks
American troops now In Mexico.
This threat was contained In a long
note replying to his last withdrawal
demand. Full of short-arm diplomatic
jabs, the note positively declines to
take the American forces out ot
Mexico. It excoriated Carranza for
his failure to co-operate and resented
his bruskness and his intimations of
bad faith.
"The defacto government Is
pleased to Ignore this obligation (to
protect American rights and chase
bandits)," said the note, "and to be
lieve that in case of a refusal to re
tire these troops there. Is no.further
recourse' than to defend Its territory
by an appeal to arms, for the govern
ment of the United States would
si'rely be lacking in sincerltv ani
friendship If It did not frankly im
press upon the defacto government
that the execution of this threat will
lead to the gravest consequences."
Bluntly the note told Carranza that
this government "cannot recede from
its settled determination to maintain
its national rights" and to prevent
further raids across the boundary.
The high lights of the note were:
Resentment of Carranza's discourte
ous tone and temper in his last note.
Charges that bandits have gone un
hampered and unpunished In attacking
Americans.
Recitation of a score of instances
of banditry.
Charges that the Carranza regime
had been Indifferent to atrocities and
even encouraged and aided some of
the leaders of some of these.
Charges that Carransa did not taV.3
