, ' '
President Wilson and Vice Presi-
dent Marshall Again Selected
to Lead Democratic Party.
At sis minutes before midnight,
Thursday, Woodrow Wilson was re

nation wag made by acclamation.
The nomination of Wilson 'was
not unanimous quite Robert Em
mott Burke, ff Illinois, voted "no"
when at 11:55 Senator Hughes, of
New Jersey, moved td nominate the
President by nficlnmatlon.
When Burke, who enmo to St.
iLouia for ihtCcsprcss purpose of
voting against Wilson, had shouted
his "not" Chairman James thunder
ed: "I declare Woodrow Wilson the
nominee of this convention by a
voto ' of 1,092 to 1." Burke was
hissed by the assemblage.
A demonstration lasting 45 min
utes followed the placing of Wilson's
name beiorc tno convention by
Judge Wcstcott, of New Jersey
The same jurist made the nominal
ing speech at Baltimoro four years
ago
. Many brief seconding speeches
were made from States "considered
doubtful in the coming enmpaign,
Judson Harmon, who opposed the
President at Baltimore, ps a rival
candidate, maden seconding speech.
There was hov opposition to Mar
shall. All the' several aspirants for
tho .honor withdrew, including Roger
Sullivan, Chicago, mc Governor
Major, Missouri.
Former Secretary of State Bryan
praised the laws enacted by tho
Administration in nu address be
fore the convention.
AH tho speakers o the session,
which followed the clock far
around the corner of midnight, re-
out of war" key-noro sounded by
Glynn.
A long delay in tho completion
of platform made it necessary to
defer its adoption mtil 'after the
nomination.
Prompt and powerful wero the
approving rosponses to every sug
gestion that the party leader was
conducting the nation's! affairs prop
erly and that his course toward the
European situation was safe, sane
and certain. Especially energetic
wero tho delegates in rallying to
their leader in his stand upon neu
trality and his censure of those of
foreign birth in the United States
who are displaying a divided al
legiance. Senator James said in defense of
tho President:
"Without orphnning a single
child, without widowing ,a single
American mother, without firing' a
single gun, without tho shedding of
a singlo drop of blood, ho wrung
from tho most militant spirit that
ever brooded abovo a battlefield an
acknowledgment of American rights
and an agreement of American de

away to tho distant shore, wo awak
ened to the realization that a good
and righteous man had been taken
from our midst.

ISSERIOUS
Militia of Every State in the Union
Called Out for Border Patrol
War Probable.
Upon General Cnrrnnza' recep
tion of, a stern refusal to heed his
demand for recall of American
troops from Mexico hinges , tho
question of a War with Mexico, in
i 'h opinion of President Wilson's
close advisers.
Virtually the entire mobile
strength of tho national guard of all
states and tho District of Columbia
were ordered mustered into the Fed
eral service Sunday night by Presi
dent Witson. About 100,000 men
are ready to respond to the call.
They -will be mobilized for such
service op the Mexican border as
may later be assigned ,to them.
General Frederick Funston, com
manding the border forces, will
designate the timo and place for
movements of guardsmen to tho in
ternational lincas the occasion shall
require. ? fl,v)i -
In announcing the orders Secre
tary Baker said the statt forces
would be employed only to guard
the border and that no additional
(roop movements into Mexico were
contemplated except in pursuit of
raiders.
Simultaneously with tho nationnl
guard call Secretary Daniels of the
Navy Department, ordered addi
tional war vessels to Mexican
waters on both coasts to snfeguard
American lives.
While the diplomatic steps were
in progress Monday, the nation wns
stirring throughout the width and
breadth with Iho movement of na
tional guardsmen mobilizing' ,td
guard the border. At least l'00,000
and possibly a fnr larger number
wero preparing for active service
under Piesident Wilson's call. For
the present their mission will Ijo
purely ono of defense, but - should
war come, they will be ready also
for that. No marching orders for
the new forces has gono out. They
will be assigned for border duty
