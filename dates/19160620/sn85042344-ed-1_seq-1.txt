WASHINGTON. June 19. Upon
(ienoral Carra.izn's reception
of a Mem refusal to heed his de
mands for recall of American troops
from Mexico hiiigoj the uuestion of
a Mexican war. In th opinion of
President Wilson's closo advisers.
They were preparjd tonight for the
possibility of open hostility after the
nolo which will bo sent forward to
morrow has reached Carranza's
hand s.
No indication htn come that the
first chief's altitude of Implacable
hostility would be shaken by the rc
Itcrat.id declaration of the latest com
munication that th9 I Tilted States has
no aggressive or warlike purpose to
ward Mexico, but Is firmly resolved
to protect her borders and end brig
andage in the border states.
The reply to Cirranza's note de
manding recall of General Pershing's
expedition war. In the hands of the
government printer tonight, prepara
tory to its delivery and publication to
morrow. Seiretar Lansing had In
tended to send it foivmrd today, but
at the last moment minor changes
and addltlnrs to tho six thousand
word document necessitated delay.
Although it had been planned to send
It by specla1 messenger to Mexico
City, the situation has changed, and
It probably will be handed to Kllseo
Arronlondo. Mexican ambassador
designatc. Nr.ticm Is Ftlrrrd.
While the diplomatic steps were
In prjress todav the nation was stir
ring throughout Its width and breadth
with tho movement of national
guardsmen moblllzl.ig to guard the
border. At least a hundred thousand
nnd possibly a fa.' larger number
were preparing for active service un
der Ptesidei.t WHsnV call. For the
present their mission will bo purely
one of defense; but should war como
they will be ready also for that. No
marching orders fir the new forces
hod gf ne out tonight. They will not
be ass'rned for border duty until
mustered Into the federal service.
F.ven when mobilization is com
pleted, onlv such units will be or
dered south as General Finston de
sires to fill the gap in his 1,800-mile
guard lino. The remainder will rest
on their arniB nt the state mobiliza
tion camps for the present awaiting
the turn of events.
lexiy Seething.
Official reports from many quar ,
ters show uiiit a flame of popular
feeling against the United states In
being kindled throughout Mexico. Ap
parently It Js being done with tht,
panction of General Carranza, for tht.
acts in many rases arc those of his
authorized military or eiv'I astents.
From Juarez to the vial roast ot
Mexico posters have appeared calling
the people to arms and asserting that
the United States is preparing to hurl
Its nrmles Into Mexico. Chaotic con
ditions prevail everywhere.. It Is said.
Clashes such as that between Mexi
can troops and American bluejacket
nt Mazatlan yesterday show Hint re
lations ire strained to the breaking
point. Tho net of a subordinate com
mander anywhere may hrirg on fight
ing that will result In war.
So far as officials here are aware,
General Carranza Is taking no strong
measures to curb his soldiers nnd
people. Upon this fact many founded
their belief tnat he Is determined to
force matters to tin Issue unless tht
American troops are withdrawn.
What Aro Motive?
Neither state department officials
Jior members of tho diplomatic corps
here have been ablj to satisfy them
selves as to Carranza's motives. Theio
nrn ronie, however, who Lelleve he
hopes to ride Into popular. ty by n
diplomatic triumph over his powerful
northern neighbor or upon a war
wave which might establish his tot
tering unverninent ill fopular estima
tion. Once the war was on and the
certain defeat of his armies fore
shadowed, these observers say, Car
ranza might sue for peace trusting
to tho magnanimity of tho Washing
ton government to leave him In
power.
Increasing uneasiness over the
plight of some live thousand Ameri
can civilians now In Mexico was mani
fested today In official quarters. Ap
proximately 1,200 of that number are
in Alexin City despite warning after
warning through American consuls
nnd other officials. Another em
phatic mcssnge advisins them to leave
Mexico Immediately was sent by the
ntate department through Special
.gent Hndpers ii day or two ago.
Officials do not hellove the Car
ranza government would sanction an
attack upon American residents or
that other foreigners would be In
volved In anv case. A weapon of ter
rible possibilities Is helng lorged In
Mexico, however, with the atlcwpts
to incite tho Ignornnt peon popula
tion to a warlike feellnc against the J

Although practically no 'lrtailf con
