TO BE MOBILIZED ALONG MEXICAN BORDER TO RELEASE REG

TROOPS CALLED OUT AND IF WAR COMES IT WILL
BE MADE A SHORT AND DECISIVE CONFLICT.
Washington, June 18. President
Wilson has called out the militia of
every state for service on the Mexi-
xan border.
Secretary Baker issued the follow
ing statement:
"In view of the disturbed condi
tions on the Mexican border and in
order to insure complete protection
for all Americans, the president has
called out substantially all the state
militia and will send them to the
border, wherever and as fully as Gen
eral Funston determines them to be
needed for the purpose stated.

TOBACCO SALES
To Continue Until July

At a meeting of the Tobacco Board
of Trade Monday it was decided to
reconsider the action closing the loose
floor sales today and Friday, June 30,
was setapart as the closing date for
auction sales on the Hopkinsville
Loose Floors. The receipts have
continued so heavy that it is evident
there is still a good deal of unsold to
bacco attracted from far and near by
the prevailing high prices.
Will Meet at Ashland.
Tiic Kentucky Press Association
will meet at Ashland July 10 and we
"view with alarm" that one whole
day is given up to a discussion of
good roads by people who will go
loaded for bear. We have seen sev
eral press meetings almost ruined by
Dr. Butts with speeches on woman
suffrage, education, prohibition and
political subjects supposed to bo left
at home when the boys go out for
recreation. Now wo aro to have
still other discussions to interfere
with press topics. No other pro
fessional or trade association wastes
its time on outside matters and why
should the K. P. A.?

WILL DISTRIBUTE DUTY.
"If all are not needed, an effort
will be made to relieve those on duty
from time to time so as to distribute
the duty.
"This call for militia is wholly un
related to General Pershing's expedi
tion and contemplates no additional
entry into Mexico, except as may bo
necessary to pursue bandits who at
tempt outrages on American soil.
"The militia are being called out so
as to leave some troops in the several
states. They will be mobilized at their

FRENCH FRONT QUIETER
Italians Holding Out With Bet
ter Success Airships
Active.
London, June 19. Czcrnowitz,
capital of the Austrian crownland of
Bukowina, is in the hands of the Rus
sians and the Austrians who had held
it are in retreat toward the Carpathian
mountains.
Hard fighting took place in the cap
ture of the Czernowitz bridgehead
and' in the passage of the river Pruth,
but when finally the Russians gained
the right bank of the river the Aus
trians evacuated the capital, leaving
1,000 prisoners and some guns in the
hands of the Russians.
To the north, in Galicia and Volhy
nia the Russiansarc meeting with des
perate resistance on the part of the
Austro-Hungarians and Germans,
some of the latfer of whom are de-
iclared by Petrograd to have been
brought from the French front in an
endeavor to aid in stemming the Rus
sian advance.
While Petrograd asserts that the
Russians are repulsing the counterat
tacks, pressing the Teutonic allies far
ther back and taking from them large
numbers of prisoners and quantities
of war materials, both Vienna and
Berlin report victories for their arms
in Galicia and Voihynia.
VICTORIES FOR TEUTONS.
Vienna says that north of the Lipa
river in uaiicia, tiic Austrians put
down a Russian attack, gaining
ground and took 900 men prisoners,
while Berlin assert tliatalong thoStyr
on both sides of Kolki and between
the Lutsk road and the Turya sector
the Germans under Gen. von Linsin
gen repulsed Russian attacks and cap
tured 3,440 Russians and some guns.
Fresh attempts by the Germans
against the French positions northeast
of Verdun met with no success, says
the French war oiikc and tho Germans
suffered heavy casualties in their at
tacks delivered against Le Mort Hom
me and Thiaumont sectors.
FIGHTING IN THE AIR.
On the French front much fighting
in the air has taken place. A British
flyer brought down a Gorman ma
chine and French aviators accounted
for seven others. The Fronch lost
one machine.
As yet the Austrians have not with
drawn troops from the Italian front
