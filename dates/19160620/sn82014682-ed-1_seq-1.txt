Uncle Sam Tells Carranza
U. S. Troops Will Stay Irr LiDnico
WASHINGTON, I). C, Jiine 20. Uncle Sam answers an emphatic
"No!" to the demands of the de facto government of Mexico that
the U. S. troops be withdrawn from Mexican soil. ;
The American note, flatly rejecting the demands of Carranza
'and his cabinet for a withdrawal
Ehseo Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador today. It rebukes the
( Mexican government plainly for the discourteous tone and temper
of its last official communication. -
j The note reviews the invasions of the United States territory,
the fact that the killing of American "citizens have been borne with
I patience and forbearing! It declares that the United States is re
luctant to conclude that despite the activities of the V lllistas and their
crimes, Carranza does hot intend or does not desire their capture,
annihilation or dispersal by ' American or Mexican troops. .
- The note goes on to recite the cases wherein the Carranza officials
arid -commanders showed indifference and lack of cooperation with
the Americans, thougV the Carranzistas knew; the whereabouts and
close proximity of the bandits. s " - ' v '
The note, which is sharp in tone, concludes with the statement
that if the de facto government continues to ignore its obligations,
and if it begins to carry out the threat to defend its territory by an
appeal to arms against the Americans, the "gravest' consequence"
will follow. , ,
After a cabinet meeting today, Secretary of State Lansing said
that nothing new; has developed and that the situation is unchanged,
so far as the state department is concerned. - v . -
