Carrajiza's reception o( a Btcrn refusal
10 ncCU Ilia uuillllliu iur ii:v;uii ui .imui-
Ican troops from Mexico hinges the
question of a war with Mexico, In the
opinion of President Wilson's close
advisers, They wcro prepared tonight
for tho possibility of open Hostilities
after the note, which will be sent for
ward tomorrow, has reached Carran
za's hands,
No Indication has come that thu
first chief's attitude of Implacable hos
tility would bo shaken by tho reiter
ated declaration of tho latest commun
ication that tho United Stntcs has no
npgrcsalvo or warlike purpose toward
Mexico, but Is nrmiy rcsoivcu 10 pro
tcct her borders and end brigandage
In the border states.
Tho reply to Carranza's note dc
mandlnir tho rccnll of General Pcrsh
lug's expedition was In tho hands of
tho printer tonight, preparatory to Its
del very nnd publication tomorrow,
Secretary- Lnnsln'g had Intended to
send It forward today but at the last
mlnuto minor changes and additions
to tho 6,000-word document necessl
fated dolay. Although It had been
Dlanned to send It by special tnesscn
ger to Mexico City the sltnntlon has
changed and It probably win bo nana
ed to Ellsoo Arrcdondo, Mexican am
bnssador designate.
Mobilizing Stirs .N'ntlon
Whilo the diplomatic stops were In
progress today, the nation waB stir
ring throughout the width nnd breadth
with the movement of national guards
men mobilizing to guard the border.
At least 100.000 nnd possibly a far
larger numbor were preparing for ac
tlve service under President Wilson's
call. For tho present their mission
will bo nurcly ono of, defense, but
should war come, they will be ready al
so for that. No marching orders for
tho new forces had gone out tonight
They will be assigned for border duty
until mustered Into the fceilcrai ser
vice. Even when moblllzntlon Is com
pleted, only such units will be order
ed south ns General Funston desires
to fill the gaps In his 1.S0O moblllza
tlon camps for the present, nwnttlng
tho turn of events.
Odlclnl reports from many quarters
show that a flamo of popular reel
Ing against tho United States is bo
lug kindled throughout Mexico.
Apparently It is ' being done with
lm annftlnn nf Horn. ml fTnrrnnzn for
the acts in many cases aro thoso of
his authorized military or civil
agents.
Call Mexicans to Amis
From Juarez to the west coast of
Mexico, posters have appeared calling
the peoplo to arms nnd asserting that
tho t'nltcd States is propnring to hurl
Its armies Into Mexico. Clashes such
ns that between Mexican troops anu
rmrlcnn bluejackets at Mazatlan yes
terday show that relations aro strained
to tho breaking point. The act of a
subordinate- commander anywhere
may bring on fighting that will result
In war.
Congress Asked (0 Help
Secretary Dakcr announced during
tho day that ho had asked ueprcscn
tatlvo Hay and Senator Chamberlain,
chairmen of tho House and Senate
Military Committees, to endeavor to
bring about the ndoptlon by Congress
of a resolution, putting Into Immediate
effect tho militia draft provisions ot
tho new army organization bill, which
will becomo effective July 1.
The resolution probably will bo pre
sented tomorrow in both houses.
American Gets Ultimatum
San Diego, Cal., June 19 An ul
timatum amounting practically to a
declaration of war against the United
States was served Friday on Com
mander Arthur O. Kavanagh. of tlw
gunboat Annapolis, by Qeneral Flores.
Carranza governor ot tho Stato of SI-
naloa, according to a radiogram sent
from tho Annapolis at Mazatlou and
received hero today by Admiral Wins-
low, Commander-in-chief of tho Pa
cific fleet.
Owing to tho low-powered radio set
ot tho Annapolis difficulty had been
experienced In communicating with
tho gunboat but enough facts have
come through to Indicate that aoncrai
Flores Iibb taken a hostllo stand
ngulnst Americans and that It was his
refusal to permit Americans to leave
Mazalan that resulted In tho clash
Sunday between tho bluojackets ot tUs
Annapolis and tho Mexicans, charac
terized as Carranza soldiers. Tho ox
uct substance ot his ultimatum has
not yet bocn recolved.
According to the reports received tno
commandor of tho Annapolis advised
all Americans in tho vicinity of Maza
tlan to leave as soon as possible.

BLOUSES AT
Our blouse business is unprecedented. The reason? Find it in the blouses at their prices. As
many styles as you will care to see in voiles and organdies. Some are embroidered, others are finished
in lace and hemstitching. It is difficult to believe that you cannot be bloused from this collection at $1.25.
SILK HOSIERY
Hosiery is more (his year than a mere adjunct to the toilet. It may sound the color note of the
whole costume. Part of this originates in the shortness of the new skirts, making Hosiery more than
usually prominent; but a good share, too, arises from a desire to have pretty Stockings. You will find
almost every conceivable color, champaigne, bronze, elephant, smoke, pink, tas, putty, gray, navy, king's
blue, pongee, flesh, with white and black of course in generous abundance, Price $1.00, $1.25, $1.50.
