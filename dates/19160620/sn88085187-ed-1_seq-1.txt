WASHINGTON, l». C,

sing today itiatlo public the
text of the note to Cairan/.a
flatly refusing his demands
for the withdrawal of tniei i-
can Hoops
It is the citrlest note Pres
ident \\ ilson has yet sent.
It threatens Carranza with the
"gravest consequences" If lie at
tacks the Americans.
It excoriates Carranza's failure
to co-operate with the U. S. and
resents his musknesF.
"Tbe de facto government has
been pleased to ignore it 3 obliga
tion to protect American rights
and chase bandits, and to be
lieve that in case of the refusal
of the C. S. to retire there is
no further recourse than to
defend its territory and appeal
to arms," was the diplomatic Jab
in the note.
Resents Tone of Note.
"Tlie United States suroly
would he lacking in sincrity aid
friendship if It did not frankly
impress upon the defacto govern
ment that the execution of such a
threat will lead to the gravest
danger."
It bluntly tells Carranza that
he cannot recede from tne settled
determination to maintain our
national rights and prevent fur
ther raids across the boundary.
It charges that the bandits have
gone unhampered and unpunish
ed, reciting instances.
It charges Carranza with In
difference, declaring that he even
encouraged and sided v.ith the
bandits.
It resents the discourteous
tone of Carranza'ss last note.
Reviews Year of War.
The note begins: "I have read
the communication on the pres
ence of the American troops in
Mexico and would be wanting In
candor if I did not; before an
swering, express surprise and re
gret caused this government by
the discourteous tone and temper
of the last communication of the
do facto government."
The note reviews the last three
years of bloodshed and civil war,
details of the attacks at Browns
ville, Redhouso Ferry, Progresso,
Las Pelndes and others, declaring
that Cnrrau/.ista adherents and
even soldiers participated in the
looting, burning and killing.
It cited the Santa Yzebe! mas
sacre and the Columbus massacre
and declared the Carranzistas
brought none of the bandits to
justice.

The paesideni carried one of

Parral, where hostile Mexicans,
presumably loyal do facto troops,
halted the pursuit.
"For these reasons American
troops have entered Mexican ter
ritory. You charged troops cross
ed tlie border without getting per
mission or consent. Obviously,
as immediate action alone could
avail, ther was no opportunity to
reach an agreement if the expedi
tion aws to bo effective."
Denies Accusation.
Lansing flatly denies the
charges that the United States
had not fully answered previous
communications. Several mis
staetments, noticeably a quota
tion purporting to show the U, S.
formally admitted the Villa band
had dispersed, was cited.
Then he answers tho allega
tions of bad faith.
"You state the American gov
ernment placed every obstacle in
the way of obtaining the facifica
tlou of Mexico. In replying to
these sweeping charges, I can
truthfully affirm that the Ameri
can government has given every
possible encouragement to the
de facto government."
Charges that American influ
ences were seeking intervention
were answered hy the citation of
inflammatory articles appearing
In Mexican^newspaper despite the
Carranzista censorship.
The note ends with a threat of
"gravest consequences," answer
ing Carranza's threat of an appeal
yo arms.

Judxe DeWltt M. Evans of the
Tacoma police court owes his life
today to a peculiar trick of fate
He had the closest escape from
sudden death at 4 o'clock yesier
day that has ever occurred In
his experience.
Just after Judge Evans had
stepped into the corridor of the
fifth floor of the city hall to drop
a letter Into a mall chute, a
round iron ball, five inches in di
ameter, plunged through the cell
ing and struck with a crash on
the tile In front or the letter
chute. Evans was less than two
feet from the spot when the ball
fell.
Investigation today proved that
the ball had been used as the
weight for a safety valve on an
antiquated steam system at the
city hall, used years ago for
operating the elevator. It slip

as the police Judge was stepping
