. General Funston Needs to Fill the Gaps in His 1,800

Are to Remain at the State
ing the Turn of Events.
Washington, June 19. Upon Gener
t Carranxa's reception of a stern re
fusal to heed his demands for recall
of American troops from Mexico
hinges the question of a Mexican war.
In the opinion of President Wilson's
close advisors. They were prepared
tonight for the possibility of open hos
tilities after the note, which will be
sent forward tomorrow, has reached
Carranza's hands.
Determined to End Brigandage.
No Indication has come that the
first Chiefs attitude of Implacable hos
tility would be shaken by the reiter
ated declaration of the latest commu
nication that the United States has no
aggressive or warlike purpose toward
Mexico, but is firmly resolved to pro
tect her borders and end brigandage
In; the border states.
Reply to Carranza in Hands of Prin
J r ter." - ;'
. The reply to Carranza's note de
manding recall . of General Pershing's
expedition was in the hands of the
government, printer . tonight, prepar
atory to Its delivery, and publication
tomorrow. Secretary Lansing had in
tended to send it forward today but
at the last moment minor changes and
additions to the 6,000 word document
necessitated delay. Although It had
"been planned, to send' It toy special
tnesslnger to Mexico City the situa
tion has changed and it probably will
be handed to Eliseo Arredondo, Mex
ican ambassador designate. .
Nation Was Stirred.
While the diplomatic steps were in
progress today, the nation was , stir
ring throughout its - width and
breadth with the movement of na
tional guardsmen mobilizing to guard
the border. At least 100,000 and pos
sibly a far larger number, were pre
paring for active service under Pres
ident Wilson's call. For the present
their mission will be purely one of de
fence, 'but should war come they will
be ready also for that. No march
ing 'orders for the new forces had
gone out tonight. They will not be
assigned for border duty until mus
tered into the federal service.
. Troops to Wait in State Camps.
Even when mobilization is complet
ed, only such of it will be ordered as
General Funston desires to fill the
gaps in his 1,800 mile guard line. The
remainder will rest on their arms at
the state mobilization camps for the
present, awaiting the turn of events.
Feeling in Mexico Against U. S.
Official reports from many quarters
how that popular feeling against the
United States is being kindled
throughout Mexico. Apparently it is
being done with 'the sanction of Gen
tral CarJinza, for the acts in many
eases are those of his authorized mil
itary civil agents.
Posters Call Mexicans to Arms.
Prom Juarez to the west coast of
Mexico posters have appeared calling
the people toarms and asserting that
the United States is preparing to
hurl its armies into Mexico. Chaotic
conditions prevail everywhere, it is
aid. - Clashes such as that between
Mexican troops and American blue-
lackets at Mazatlan yesterday show
that relations are strained - to the
breaking point.
The act of a subordinate command
r anywhere may bring on fighting
that will result in war.
Carranza Not Curbing Soldiers,
So far as officials here "are aware,
General Carranza Is taking no strong
measures to curb his soldiers and peo
pie. Upon this fact many of them
' found their belief that he is determin
ed to force matters to an issue unless
the American troops are withdrawn.
. ; Motives of Carranza.
Neither state department officials
hor members of the diplomatic corps
here have been able to satisfy them
lolves as to General Carranza's mo
tives. There are some, however, who
telieve he hopes to ride into populari
ty on a diplomatic triumph over his
Powerful northern neighbor, or upon
(. war wave which might establish his
ottering government In popular esti
mation. ' Once the war was on and
the certain defeat of his armies fore
Jhadowed, these observers say, Gen
Iral Carranza-might sue for peace.

Washington government to leave him
In power.
5,000 American Civilians ' in Mexico.
-Increasing uneasiness over the
Might of some 6.000 American clvi
Bans now in Mexico was manifested
today in official quarters. Approxi
mately 1.200 of that number are in
Mexico City, despite warning after
learning through American consuls
Ind other officials. Another emphatic
toeasage advising tnem to leave xaex
fco- Immediately was sent by the state
apartment through Special Agent
Rodgers a day or two ago.

case. A weapon of terrible possibili

cipitate a situation beyond the control
of the government.
Protection For' Colony Near Tampico,
. Careful preparation has been made
for the protection of the big American
colony near Tampico. ; In numbers it
exceeds that in the capital, but it is
near the sea and navy gunboats and
light craft already have been desig
nated to offer prompt aid. If nec
essary, small landing parties would be
sent to open a way to the boats.

ever, no. such solution presents itself.
It. was suggested to one official today
that: an expeditionary force ., might be
rushed to the relief of ' Americans
there.' He replied that it would mean
moving an army of 50,000 or perhaps
100,000 men -and 'would take at least
two nfonths to get them there.
Ask That Troops Be Sent to Border.
Although practically no details con
cerning the mobilization - of national
guardsmen reached the war depart
ment tonight, acknowledgments of the
orders came from every governor,
with word that the troops had been
ordered under arms. . In several in
stances a request that the state be
allowed to send its full contingent ta
the border, instead . of the regiments
or brigades called for. accompanied
the acknowledgment. Governor
Dunn of Illinois was one of those who
made this request.
To Make New Law Effective at Once,
Secretry Baker announced during
the. day that he had asked Representa
tive Hay and Senator Chamberlain,
chairmen of the house and senate mil
itary committees, to endeavor to bring
about the adoption by congress or
resolution putting into immediate ef
fect the militia draft provisions of the
new army organization bill which will
become effective July 1.
SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF FIELD
ARTILCERY AND MACHINE GUNS
Most Pressing Need Will be - Horses
to Mount Cavalry,
Washington, June 19. Ample equip
ment of all -kinds Is on hand at the
various depots of the armp, Secretary
BaKer said today, to complete the out
fits ol all the guardsmen called for
service. A sufficient supply of field
artillery and machine guns and enough
ammunition for any fighting that
might occur -also is on hand.
The most pressing need will be
horses to mount all of tne national
guard cavalry and supply gun teams
for the field batteries. The large ex
cess held in army remount stables for
the needs of- the regulars will fan
short of present needs by many thou
sands. Some of the states have pur
chased horses for their mounted
troops and artillery. Officials are
busy working out the number that
must be supplies and the quickest way
of securing them, r.
Another step taken at the war de
partment today was preparation of or
ders calling out doctors of the medi
cal reserve corps to examine guards
men for muster into the federal ser
vice. The department will insist upon
the high physical" standards of the
regular army. In some states that al
ready is required , and there will be
little delay. In others, there is rea
son to believe, officers say, that rAtyi
Incapable of arduous military service
have been enrolled for the purpose of
keeping the companies up to the min
imum strength necessary for federal
recognition and participation In fed
eral appropriations.
WORK OF MOBILIZING
THE NATIONAL GUARD
Progressing Rapidly JE very Regiment
Short of Its War Strength.
Chicago, June 19. Work of prepar
ing to mobilize the national guard In
the states included in the central de
partment of the United States army
progressed rapidly today. As every
regiment Is short of Its war strength,
tne nrst worx unaertaicen in the dif
ferent states is to bring each organ!
zatlon -up to Its full strength by re
cruiting.. This work, it is believed, will take
several days and then : the regiments
will be assembled at the state mobill
cation camp designated for each state

Thomas H. Barry, commander of the
central department of the . United
States army.

GENERAL FUNSTON ANXIOUSLY
STUDYING BORDER SITUATION
For Indication of Hostility on the Part
of Carranza Troops
San Antonio, Texas, June 19. While
100,000 members of the militia were
being mobilized tonight, General Fun
ston anxiously studied the border for
any indication of hostility on the jiart
of Carranzas troops, unicers com
manding patrols along the Rio Grande
from Brownsville to El Paso, secured
what information they could concern
ing the movements on the Mexican
side, both of bandits and government
troops but no official report reached
army headquarters here after any in
cident that appeared likely to disturb
the delicately balanced relations of the
two countries.
General Pershing's reports indicated
that General Jacinto Trevino's troops
had not yet made any advance, move
and army omcers believed it improba
ble that they would not unless. Tre-
vlno received special orders from (Mex
ico City.
Such informitin- rached Gen--al
Funston concerning the movement
of Mexican troops inaicated the adop
tion of a plan not-to maintain heavy
garrisons at border points but to hold
the bulk of - the . border army some
miles south of the Rio Grande.
, The -garrison at NueVo .Laredo, -Mex-!
.ico, was. strenartrienea by a, mere
handful of men, but at Lampazos. be
tween Laredo and Monterey, . there
were held 5,000 or 6,000 troops. The
garrison af Laredo tonight was less
than lwjo.
At Piedras Negras the Mexican town
opposite icagle rass,- the 'Mexican gar
rison was busy leaving all day. To
night a considerable force yet re
mained but the -larger part had moved
to - points farther south - where they
were incorporated with bodies of
troops. Before leaving Piedras Ne
gras the Mexicans dismantled the ma
chine shops, removing large quantities
or the material to the interior.
PERSHING'S CAVALRY 13
IS IN PURSUIT OF BANDITS
Detachments Operating South
West of Namquipa.
and
Columbus, N. M., June 18. General
J. J. Pershing, American expedition
ary commander, has cavalry detach
ments operating south and west of the
Namquipa base in pursuit of bands of
Mexican marauders, according to sev
eral reliable reports here today. It
was asserted the General Pershine
received reports of the presence of the
bandits almost simuletaneously with
General Trevino's warning that any
movement oi tne American troops oth
er than toward the border would- be
considered a hostile act. Pending ad
vices irom General J"unston, it was
said, he issued no orders to give chase
until late yesterday.
While some anxiety was expressed
here over - the move, it was believed
that General Trevino will not seize ud-
on it as an -excuse for attacking the
detachments. It was pointed out that
the movement Is minor and in no way
affects the general expeditionary
campaign.
