WAR IMMINENT
WITH MEXICO
President Calls Out Militia Of All
The States For Duty On Border
Where Danger Threatens
Washington, June 20. Upon Gen.
Carranza's reception of a stern re
fusal to heed his demands for recall
of American troops from Mexico
hinges the question of a Mexican war
in the opinion of President Wilson's
close advisers. They were prepared
Monday night for the possibility of
open hostilities after the note which
was sent to Carranza Tuesday.
No indication has come that the
First Chief's attitude of implacable
hostility would be shaken by the re
iterated declaration of the latest
communication that the United States
has no aggressive or war-like purpose
toward Mexico but is firmly resolved
to protect her borders and end brig
andage in the border states.
While the diplomatic steps were
in progress Monday, the nation was
stirring throughout its width and its
breadth with the movement of nation
al guardsmen mobilizing to guard the
border. At least 100,000, and possi
bly a far larger number, were pre
paring for active service under Pres
ident Wilson's call. For the present
their mission will be purely one of
defense, but should war come they
will be ready for that also. They
will not be assigned for border duty
until mustered into the federal ser
vice. Even when mobilization is
completed only such units will be or
dered south as Gen. Funston desires
to fill the gaps in his 1,800-mile
guardline. The remainder will rest
on their arms at the state mobiliza
tion camps for the present awaitng
the turn of events.
Official reports from many quarters
show that a flame of popular feeling
against the United States is being
kindled throughout Mexico. Appar
ently it is being done with the sanc
tion of Gen. Carranza, for the ac
in many cases are those of his au
thorized military or civil agents.
From Juarez to the west coast of
Mexico posters have appeared calling
the people to arms and asserting that
the United States is preparing to
hurl its armies into Mexico. Chaotic
conditions prevail everywhere, it is
said. Clashes such as that between
Mexican troops and American blue
jackets at Mazatlan Sunday show
that relations are strained to the
breaking point. The act of a subor-j
dinate commander anywhere may
bring on fighting that will result in
war. So far as officials at Washing
ton are aware, Gen. Carranza is tak
ing no strong measures to curb his
soldiers and people. Upon this fact
many of them found their belief that
he is determined to force matters to
an issue unless the American troops
are withdrawn.
Neither state department officials I
nor members of the diplomatic corps
at Washington have been able to sat
isfy themselves as to Gen. Carranza's
motives. There are some, however, ',
who believe he hopes to ride into
popularity on a diplomatic triumph ,, . , , n ,, ,

ers say, Gen. Carranza might sue for i

of the Washington government to ,

Increasing uneasiness over the
plight of some 5,000 American civil
ians now in Mexico was manifested
in official circles. Approximately 1,-

City, despite warning after warning.

through American consuls and other
officials. Another emphatic message
advising them to leave Mexico im
mediately was sent by the state de
partment a day or two ago.
Officials do not believe the Carran
za Government would sanction an at
tack upon American residents or that
other foreigners would be involved
in any case
A weapon of terrible
possibilities is being forged in Mex -
ico, however, with the attempts to
incite the ignorant peon population
to a warlike feeling against the
United States. Mobs formed by
half-starved natives, who have been
told that all of Mexico's accumulated
troubles are traceable to the Ameri
cans might well precipitate a situa
tion beyond the control of the Gov
ernment. Kentucky Troops to Mobilize.
Brigadier General Roger D. Wil
liams, commanding the Kentucky bri
gade, telegraphed General Hugh L.
Scott yesterday morning that the
Kentucky National Guard is ready
for service and that its companies
are all well equipped.
General Williams said that the
present strength of the Kentucky
National Guard is about 2,200, but
that he did not believe that the Ken
tucky troops would be ordered from
their mobilization camp to the front
until their strength had been re
cruited up to four or five thousand.
He said that would mean that the
troops would be in camp, becoming
hardened to camp conditions for six
ty or ninety days.
The Washington order calling out
the Kentucky brigade, National
Guard, specified Ft. Thomas as place
of mobilization, or "such other point
as the commander of the Department
of the East may designate." After a
conference Adjutant General Ellis
wire.d the War Department asking
that Earlington be substituted for
Ft. Thomas because of its geographi
cal position and the larger space.
The order from Washington re
quires that companies be mobilized
at peace strength, sixty-five men,
and that they can be recruited up
to war strength of 150 men. Adju
tant Genral Ellis sent a message to
Washington asking whether the mili
tia should be mobilized under the
existing contract or whether men
should first be re-enlisted under the
new law.
Pershing Taking Every Precaution.
Columbus, N. M., June 20. Gen.
Pershing is taking every precaution
to prevent a clash with Carranza
troops being precipitated by some
trivial incident, according to reports
from the field yesterday. Detach
ments which for the past few weeks
have been operating within a few
miles of the camps of the troops of
the de facto government, have been
withdrawn, while scouting patrols
have been given orders to ride their
territory with extreme caution. All
of the soldiers of the American com
mand have been warned to exercise
great care in distinguishing bandits
from Mexican soldiers.

qua tent, has been secured and all
the conveniences needed will be pro
vided. A maid will look after the

Bilious Attacks
When you have a bilious attack
your liver fails to perform its funct
ions. You become constipated. The
food you eat ferments in your stom
ach instead of digesting. This in
flames the stomach and causes
nausea, vomiting and a terrible head
ache. Take Chamberlain's Tablets.
They will tone up your liver, clean
out your stomach and you will soon
be as well as ever. They only cost
a quarter. Obtainable everywhere.
NOBLE WOMAN
GOES TO REWARD
Mrs. R. H. Bronaugh Passes Away at
Her Home in Crab Orchard
After Long Illness.
Mrs. Vina Hays Bronaugh, wife of
Col. Reuben H. Bronaugh, one of the
East End's most prominent and fore
most citizens, died at their home in
Crab Orchard Monday morning. Mrs.
Bronaugh had been in poor health
for several years, but the end came
suddenly and almost unexpectedly to
the many friends and loved ones who
did not realize that her condition was
so serious. Only a few hours before
had dangerous symptoms developed,
and none had anticipated that the
end was so close to a beautiful life.
She became seriously ill Sunday and
dissolution followed fast, even be
fore some of her children, who lived
in nearby towns could be summoned
to her bedside.
Mrs. Bronaugh was in her 62nd
year. She was a native of Pulaski
county, a Miss Hays, and a member
of a prominent family. Thirty
eight years ago she became the wife
of Col. Bronaugh and sine then had
made her home with him in Crab
Orchai-d, where they raised a family,
and gathered about them a circle of
friends and loved ones who will join
their tears and sorrow with that of
the devoted husband and the children
at the loss of a splendid wife and
mother and noble Christian charac
ter. Mrs. Bronaugh in early life join
ed the Baptist church, and was ever
faithful to its tenets and the teach
ings of the meek and lowly Naza
rene. In addition to her husband she is
survived by the following children:
Dr. J. M. Bronaugh, of Lexington,
Reuben H. Bronaugh, Jr., of St.
Louis, Miss Anna Bronaugh, of Pine
ville, Miss Catherine Bronaugh, of
Lexington, and T. Hays Bronaugh,
of Crab Orchard.
The remains of this good woman
were laid in their final resting place
Monday afternoon after short but
beautiful services conducted at the
home by Mr. J. C. McClary, of this
city. A hostif. of friends, and loved
ones followed the body to the grave1'
in the Crab Orchard cemetery and
mutely testified to the loss which will
be felt in the whole community over
her taking away. Her husband and
loved ones have the sympathy of all
in their hour of sorrow.
LOST INFANT DAUGHTER
Rev. and Mrs. D. M. Walker have
the sympathy of a host of friends in
the loss of their infant daughter,
who passed away Saturday. The
child was born Thursday, but surviv
ed only a few short hours.
DANVILLE COURT DAY.
A fairly good crowd attended Dan
ville court Monday, but trading was
slow. There were very few cattle
on the market, but the supply was
equal to the demand. A few choice
ones sold close to 8c. Butcher stuff
was slow at 5c to 6c. Several horses
changed hands at $100 to $140.
There was a demand for good mules
J. H. Baughman, formerly of this
county, selling one to W. T. Robin
son for $250. Mr. Robinson paid
$235 for another. Both of the Con
gressional candidates were present
and did a lot of handshaking. Mr.
Montgomery left about noon for
Lawrenceburg, but Mr. Helm spent
the day. Both gentlmen seemed
satisfied with their prospects in
Boyle.
BREAKS LIMB IN FALL.
Mrs. E. S. Fisher sustained a brok
en limb last night as a result of a fall
while returning from calling on a
neighbor. She had been across the
way to the home of Mrs. J. R. Pow
ell and when returning home she
missed a step leading from the front
porcn ard fell on the concrete pave
ment. All of her weight was thrown
on her right limb, breaking it be
tween the hip and knee. Doctors
were summoned and the injury
dressed but it proved to be very
painful and will no doubt keep Mrs.
Fisher in bed for some time. There
are many of her friends who will re
gret to ler.rn of her misfortune and
who hope that she will soon recover.
