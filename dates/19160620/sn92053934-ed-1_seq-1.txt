TRIPLE DRIVE OF

raris Claims to HaTe Repulsed Three
"ight Attacks of Germans Along
Tcrdnn Front.
Paris, June 20. Three German at
tacks made last night on the French
positions northwest of Hill No. U-l
were repulsed by the fire of the French
machine guns, according to an official
statement issued today by the war
office. The Germans are heavily bom
barding the French positions in the
neighborhood of Vaux, Chapitre and
Chattancourt.
The text of the statement follows:
"On the right bank of the river
Meuse German forces delivered three
attacks last night upon our positions
northwest of Hill No. 321 but all their
efforts were broken by the activity
of our machine guns and our curtains
of fire.
"The bombardment has been in
tense in the region of the woods of
Vaux and Chapitre and in the sector
of Chattancourt on the left bank of
the river.
"In the Vosges a surprise attack of
the enemy upon an advanced sap in
the region of Miehelbach, south of
Thann, resulted in failure."
ALLIES PLAN HUGE
BANKING CONCERN?
London, June 20. Although London
morning papers all deny reports of the
organization of a new international
banking house with an initial csviital
of 10,000,000 pounds sterling, aiming,
under the supervision of the govern
ment, to assist British traders and
manufacturers to secure a big share
of the trade with the allied countries
after the war, it appears that tenta
tive plans for some such organization
are being discussed in high financial
quarters. It is felt that a great bank
of this type, cooperating with similar
institutions in France, Italy and Rus
sia, would enable British traders to
participate to the exclusion of the
Germans in the enormous work of re
storing and rebuilding the ravaged
portions of Kurope.

HUNGER SWELLS
GARRANZA ARMY
Starving Teens of Mexico Reported
Flocking to De Facto Chief at
Promises of Food.
El Paso, Texas, June 20. Hunger is
swelling the army that General Car
ranza is recruiting in northern Mexico,
in preparation for possible hostilities
with the United States, according to
stories brought here" today by Amer
icans arriving from the interior.
Peons, who for some time have been on
the verge of starvation, have been
flocking to his standard in the last
few days, in return for promises of
food and clothing, they said. No ap
plicants have been rejected, according
to stories, which told of boys of ten
and twelve years of age and men too
aged to stand erect being recruited.
One of the arrivals, an American'
business man of Mexico City esti
mated that there are now 23,000 troops
in Chihuahua state, of whom about
2,000 are in Chihuahua City, 4,000 in
Juarez and 5,000 in Villa Ahumada, the
northern Chihuahua base. The re
mainder practically surround the
American expeditionary command on
the south, east and west He said al
so that several thousand troops, whioa
had been at Chihuahua recently were
sent toward San Antonio and osten
sibly stationed along the line of the
Mexico Northwestern railway, south of
General Pershing's command. Ref
ugees brought with them graphic
stories of economic conditions. One
man said that he and his fellow pas
sengers would have starved had not
the train stopped at times long
enough to allow them to get out and
eat raw beans from fields. Roth El
Paso and Juarez were outwardly calm
today but in both towns soldiers were
kept close to their camps. The num
ber of American crossing into Juarez
today was smaller than usual hut none
of them reported manifestations of
hostility. Educated Mexicans, some of
whom have been living in El Paso and
others who have arrived here recently
from interior points in the United
States, have been crossing the fron
tier in large numbers, asserting that
their place in the crisis is with their
people.
T. D. Edwards, consul in Juarez,
established a desk in the American
customs house for the transaction of
diplomatic business. He denied that
the consulate is to be closed but said
that it is to remain in charge of a
clerk, open at specified hours for the
transaction of commercial business.

SHUTEYESTO
REQUESTS OF
MEXICO CHIEF
American Note Is Plain Re
fusal of United States to
Withdraw Troops. J
REBUKE GOVERNMENT
Reply Sharply Criticises Ac
tions and Manner of
Southern Republic '
Washington,! Jnne 20. "With
President Wilson's firm refusal
to withdraw American troops from
Mexico on its way to the de facto
frovernment, embodied in a note
sternly arraigning' the whole
course of General ( arranza In the
situation which has brought the
two countries to the Terse of war,
the administration con tinned to
day its preparations to meet any
emergency that may arise.
War or peace rests with General
Carranza. The position of the
I'nited States is pointedly set forth
in its review of the apparent In
ability of Carranza to prevent bor
der raids and to keep the obliga
tion he owes the world by the pre
servation of order in his domin
ions. "If," says the note, "the de facto
government is pleased to ignore this
obligation and to believe that 'in case
of a refusal to retire these troops
there is no further recourse than to
defend its territory by an appeal to
arms," the government of the United
States would surely be lacking in sin
cerity and friendship if it did not
frankly impress upon the de facto
government that the execution of this
threat will lead to the gravest conse
quence. While this government would
deeply regret such a result it cannot
recede from its settled determination
to maintain its national rights and to
perform its full duty in preventing
further invasions of the territory of
the United States and in removing the
peril which Americans along the inter
national boundary have borne so long
with patience and forebearance."
Handed to Ambassador.
The note was handed early today to
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican am
bassador designate here, for trans
mission to Mexico City. Copies were
furnished to all the foreign embassies
and legations and a summary cabled
to Special Agent Rodgers at the Mex
ican capital for his information.
In addition to refusing to withdraw
the troops and warning that execution
of the threat to attack them will be
followed by the gravest consequences,
the note serves notice that as long as
the Carranza forces continue their
present attitude, no arms or ammu
nition or machinery for their manu
facture will be permitted to reach
Mexico from the United States.
It concludes with the statement that
if the de facto government continues
to ignore this obligation and carries
out its threat to defend its territory by
an appeal to arms against the Ameri
can troops the gravest consequences
will follow.
"While thsi government would
deeply regret such a result," says the
note, "it cannot recede from its set
tled determination to maintain its na
tional rights and to perform its full
duty in preventing invasions of the
territory of the I'nited States and in
removing the peril which Americans
along the international boundary have
borne so long with patience and fore
bearance." Carranza Ignores Crimes I
"I am reluctant to be forced to the
conclusion which might be drawn from
the circumstances," Secretary Lansing
declares, "that the de facto govern
ment, in spite of the crimes commit
ted and the sinister designs of Villa
and his followers, did not and does not
intend or desire that these outlaws
should be captured, destroyed or dis
persed by American troops or, at the
request of this government, by Mexi
can troops."
Deny Ulterior Motive.
The purposes of the United States
government towards Mexico, ques
tioned in the last Mexican note, are
announced in the following language:
"If a denial is needed that this gov
ernment has had ulterior and improper
motives in its diplomatic representa
tions; or has countenanced the activi
ties of American sympathizers and the
American press opposed to the do
facto government, 1 am glad most em
phatically to deny it. It is, however,
a matter of common knowledge that
the Mexican press has been more act
ive than the press in the United States
in endeavoring to inflame the two peo
ples against each other and to force
the two countries into hostilities."
Lanslnir Gives Views.
Secretary Lansing in the first para
graph of the note acknowledged re
ceipt of the Mexican communication
and said he would not be candid "it
he did not answer the allegations and
conclusions of the de facto govern
ment " The note expresses "deep con
cern and increasing disappointment
over the progress of the revolution
and reviews the troubled conditions of
