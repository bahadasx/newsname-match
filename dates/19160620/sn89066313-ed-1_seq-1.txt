were allowed for the wrckin,; work
but it is probable that it will be "ori
pleted in much less time. Inimedvite
ly after the wrecking, excavation w'll
begin for the new tloon-' Coupnty Na
tional Hank building.
en Ideas l'se.1 :it l.ivern.
Tlie excavation for the lun.el llnone
Taern ha been in .irogrcss about a
week. Tlie time of tinis'iin.' it will de
pend largely on wejthe condition-,
but it is probable tint tlie work on
tV foundations can be started in three
weeks The L. W. Dumas Construc
tion Company has charge i:f the wirk
and has si men and ten teams om
iloj ed.
The features of this vork aie ths
'ilectric horse" and thn dump car.

car? are run down n a track into a
ii Lelow tlie level of th- 'loor and are
tilled by men and tevjis who drag the

me pit. When the d.ii'ii' cats are lill
e! they are drawn up fae f"rk by a
t.'otor, called an "elects i hourse," to
a iilatform, where they are dumped
into wagons beneath. This means of
removing the dirt saves a great la' of
time and labor.
Hall 'I healer .Near Completion.
The Hall Theater building is mow
nearing completion. The balcony Is
being linlslicd, ami it is thought that
the chairs will be here by tomorrow.
The work on the floors has been held
back by the delay in the heating ap
paratus, which is now being installed.
The heating and cooling system is
being Installed at a cost of $6,000 and
Is said to bo tlie only one of its kind in
the state outside of St. Iuis and Kan
sas city. A large fan in the basement
will force fresh air into the building
and another in the roof at the front
will expel the foul air. The heat
ing company gives a guarantee with
the sjstem to heat the air in the room
to a temperature of 70 degrees when
the air outside has a temperature of
10 and to change the air in the build
ing five times an hour.
"The arrangement of the seats is be
ing emphasized," said O. B. Wilson,
who has charge of the work, today.
"I don't think there will be a seat in
the house from which a person can seo
better than from any other."

L
MUST MIX, HE SAYS
The Rev. W.C. Bitting Talks
at University Summer
Session Assembly.
TELLS OF EDUCATION
Thinks Reality, Trust, Open
ness and Social Life
Are Necessary.
"Religion and education are not
mutually exclusive. Thej are like
the. streams which mingle in a great
river." said the Rev. W. C Hitting
of the Second Baptist Church of St.
I.ouis in an address at the University
assembly this morning. He then took
up the four necessary elements of
modern education, showing that they
arc all essentially Christian.
The first is a passion for realitj'.
Education today accepts no authority
except absolute realitj-. Modern re
ligion, as well as education, encour
ages investigation.
In the second place, education now
demands that we trust ourselves to
get reality and trains us to get It.
It teaches us to inquire into methods
of studj', not to be satisfied with
learning the results.
"A librarj-," said Mr. Bitting, "is
a grocery of canned goods. One
original idea is worth a shelf-full of
the ideas of the past." The results
of scientific experiment are God's
messages to man.
The third requirement of educa
tion is an open mind. Facts are sa
cred. Mr. Bitting called dogmatism
an unpardonable sin. He spoke of
the punctuation of modern intellectu
ality the comma to indicate a pause
for breath, the semicoln to classify,
but no period at all. Where there is
a period the man has quit; he can
not have finished.
Finallj-, an educated man must give
the proper emphasis to social obliga
llui? The chareh alo demands this,
the speaker held.
"The church must make room for
the educated man, but it cannot do so
without his help," Mr. Bitting said.
"The educated Christian is the key
to the whole world."

F. A. Sampson first addressed the

realty; second, that a person's proper
ty cannot be taken from him w ithout
due process of law. The remedy he
suggested was for the light wires to

NOT TO JOLEST U.S.

Consequences If He At
tacks American Troops.
NEW NOTE IS BLUNT
Says This Government Will
Not Recede and Will Pre
vent More Raids.
I'.r I'liltnl Press.
WASHINGTON, June 20. The
United States threatened General
Carranza with tho gravest conse
quences if his forces attack the Ameri
can soldiers In Mexico. The threat,
which is contained in a long note re
pljing to Carranza's request for the
withdrawal of the American troops
from Mexico, was a Tlat refusal to the
request.
The note is filled with short-arm
diplomatic jabs. It excoriates Car
ranza for his failure to co-operate
with the American forces, resents hi3
brusqueness and intimates bad faith.
It bluntly tells him that this Gov
ernment will not recede from Its set
tled determination to maintain its na
tional rights to prevent further
border raids.
Pessimism prevailed in official cir
cles this afternoon over the Mexican
situation. Even those who thought
that the call for the militia might
make Carranza recede have given up
hope.
