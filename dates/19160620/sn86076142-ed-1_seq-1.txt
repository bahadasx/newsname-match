TO CITY OF MEXICO
United States Resents the Tone
of Demand; and Hits Back
With a Solar Plexus
(By Aaeoeiated Preet.)
WASHINGTON, .Juno 20. The American note fliitly ri'jwtiug
farranza'a tlc'iniincls for withdrawal of l.'nitcd States troops from
Mexico and rebuking the t'arrtinza government for tin- discourteous
tone and temper of its last note, was handed Ambassador Kli.o
Arredondo, the Carrana representative this lmirmiiK.
"While this government would deeply regret sueli a result."
says the note, "it eaimot recede from its settled determination to
maintain its natural rights and perform its full duty in preventing
further invasions of the territory of the I'nited States by removing
tlie peril which Americans along the border have borne long with
.patience and orebearance."
.Outrages against Americans and their property, in Mexico and
the United States ure reviewed and a warning given that troops
will be kept in Mexico until the de facto government perforins the
duty which the United States has not sought of pursuing the bandits,
who ought to be arrested and punished by the Mexican government.
The note concludes with the statement that if the de facto
government continues to ignore its obligations and carries out the
threat to defend its territory by an appeal to arm against Ameriean
troops the gravest consequence will follow.

Midway Consolidated In the early
days was a consistent producer, but
only from a tiny angle of Its terri
tory. The map of Tonopah shows
that the shaft from which the divi
dends came is situated off In a corner
of the estate, apparently so located
that It might be under the wing of
greater producer.
This section of the company's ter
ritory still Is making good, under the
lease system, and the royalties go far
toward paying the cost of the heavy
development work that la being car

The new shaft of the Midway Is
situated more nearly In the center
of the territory and at a vantage
point from which exploration and ex
traction of ore may be economically
carried forward. The shaft Is well
equipped for heavy work.
