Washington is suing the state of Min
nesota for $1,500,000 damages for
damages alleged done to North Da
kota farm lands by the overflow of
the Mustinka state ditch which the
Minnesota legislature in 1911 order

of fertile land, comprising 80 farms,
has been rendered valueless. It is
alleged that the lands were never
overflowed until 1911. The losses
are reported to be over $100,000 an
nually.
On account of it being an action
between states it was filed in the U.

(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Rotterdam, Holland, May 25.
(By mail)Babies seven months to
a year old are eating carrots, apples
and spinach in Germany.
Oilier folks besides babies are hav
ing food troubles. These food stor
ies we'll tell about them all.
If you watch the consulates here
and keep your eyes on the incoming
trains you can meet, every day, a
scent for persons who have just come
from Germany and who will gladly
tell you what experiences they have
had in their kitchens, dining rooms
and stomachs since the food stringen
cy in Germany became noticeable.
These travelers feel themselves
heroes, as, indeed, you come to regard
them, in a manner of speaking, when
you see them abandon to a full, man's
sized meal here.
Travelers to Berlin, especially the
American writing kind, live at the
best hotels. They return with stor
ies of plentiful and excellent food.
Berlin is the wartime show place
of Germany and the hotels where
writers go are the wartime show
places of Berlin. What the Amer
ican writers have said of the plenti
fulness and the excellence of the food
is not necessarily true.
Here in Rotterdam you get the
truth, straight from the dining rooms
and kitchens of civilians in every
part of Germany. It indicates that
life in Germany is uncomfortable,
highly so, for a civilian who is keep
ing house.
Here's a Swedish mechanic from
Germany, running around Rotterdam
filling his arms with packages of ba
con, bottles of olive oil and rice. Per
haps the Hollanders will refuse him
permission to take these across the
border but "I'm going to make a try
of it," he says.
Here's a pretty American girl din
ing alone in a Rotterdam restaurant.
She's studying music in Berlin. "Fve
just run over to Holland to spend a
week eating," she says.
Here's a Spanish woman with three
little children. "I brought the baby
down to get him some milk. He is
tired of carrots, spinach and apples.
No wonder he is only seven months."
And here are Germansrich, eld
erly, retired Germanswho haunt
the doorways of the hotel restaur
ants, waiting for the American plan
dinner bell to ring and who seem to
be always eating, even at the hated
English tea hour. They are here a
week. Then they go back to Ger
many.
Germany, civilian Germany Is
hungry. Not hungry for victuals,
because victuals are anything a hu
man being can eat and digest, but for
decent food like meat and wheat and
milk and animals and vegetable fats.
(How and why tiny, toothless Ger
man babies eat apples, carrots, spin
ach and oatmeal, instead of gurgling
milk, will be the subject of Shep
herd's next food story).

WHAT MEXICO IS
COSTING UNCLE SAM
It is costing a little over

$10,000,000 so far.
When the militia is mobil

Food costs the government 30
cents per day per man.
(By United Press)
Washington, June 20.The United
States today threatened Carranza
with grave consequences if he at
tacked the American troops in Mex
ico. This threat was incorporated in
a long note replying to his latest
withdrawal demand.
The note was filled with short arm
diplomatic jabs. It absolutely de
clines to take the U. S. forces from
Mexico. It excoriates Carranza for
his failure to co-operate and resents
his bruskiness and intimations as bad
faith. It. charges that bandits are
permitted to go unhampered and un
punished.
The state department made public
the text of the note today. The
communication is an unusually long
one and is one of the curtest that the
U. S. has sent Mexico.
Fails to Aid.
The note charges that Carranza has
been indifferent to atrocities and even
encourages and aids some of the lead
ers of them. It charges that Carran
za failed to take the proper steps to
apprehend Villa.
There is a strong feeling here to
day that America will attempt to bot
tle up the Mexican forts immediately.
Officials admitted that this was pos
sible but declined to state that this
move was anticipated.
Pessimism predominated in the offi
cial quarters today. Those who
thought that a show of strength
would quiet Mexico are less confi
dent. It is also considered certain
that the U. S. militia forces will see
Mexican service.
President Wilson today urged
members of the senate naval commit
tee to specify at least one and pos
sibly two dreadnaughts in the navy
bill.
At Fort Snelling.
St. Paul, Minn., June 20.General
Wood today ordered the quartermas
ter staff to get Fort Snelling ready.
It is presumed that he intends to im
mediately start the mobilization of
the Minnesota national guard here.
The guard is now being held in ar
mories through the state. i
Defy Mexicans.
El Paso, June 20.U. S. soldiers
defy Carranza. It was learned that
the bandits are operating south and
west of Namiquipa. General Persh
ing has sent detachments after them.
This is in direct opposition to Car
ranza's order. If Carranza carries
out his threat it is considered certain
that U. S. and Carranza soldiers will
clash.
Interest on Del Bio
San Antonio, June 20.Interest
on the border today centered upon
Del Rio where it is reported that 1,-
500 Mexicans and Yaqui Indians are
Fuprcaching the city. Del Rio is
i just west of here on the Rio Grando.
A battalion has been sent there on F||^
motor trucks to defend the city.
