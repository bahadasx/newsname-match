No. 48

EARUNGTON
Adjutant . General Announces the Decision
is
Lexington and Louisville
Both Tried to Change '
Plan
CO. G AND HOSPITAL CORPS
RECRUITING JJ) FULL STRENGTH
The Louisville Evening Post
publishes the following special from
yesterday's edition:
Washington, June 20. The Ad
jutant General today stated that Earl
ington had been finally selected as
the point of mobilization for the
Kentucky troops, and that it would
be useless for the representative of
any other city to seek to change the
program following the designation of
Earlington by Adjutant General Ellis
and the change from Fort Thomas to
that point. Lexington made stren
uous efforts to have that city select
ed.
lliis appears detinue though no
orders to that effect have yet been
received by the local officers. Lex
ington ottered to spend ?iU,uu(J on
the camp site preparation and Louis
ville sought to bring great pressure
to have troops mobilized at that city.
It is announced by Gov. Stanley
that the State mobilization camp his
gone begging for more than a year
and that the St. Bernard Mining Co,
alone has until now made any offer
of grounds for such camp. When
it become known the troops would
mobilize for preparation for border
service and the enthusiasm started,
Lexington and Louisville both started
getting busy to try to take the camp
through the exercise of big politicrl,
personal and financial influence. If
the Post's story is true they have
failed.
Tender has been made by Earling'
Ion people of ample grounds for
camp site for use in mobilizing the
National Guard of Kentucky. The
grounds are situated just North of
Earlington and are conveniently near
the railroad yards, which include
more than nine miles of siding, on
which troop trains could be handled
without a hitch. Earlington is also
within easy reach of city markets
from which all necessary supplies
can be had promptly. Ample supply
of good water for all camp purposes
is at hand and every facility for the
convenience and comfort of the camp
will be provided. There are adequate
drill grounds and the fact that the
State Rifle Range is located hereis
another excellent card in Earlington's
favor. The field and staff officers
whose homes are here and the officers
and men of G. Company are full of
interest over the call for mobilization
and are ready to take their part with
enthusiasm. Captain Ben Wilson of
G. Company said today his Com
pany will within twenty-four hours
be recruited to full strength.
If the Kentucky troops are mobiliz
ed here it will bring more than 220O
men to the camp, which might be
maintained for some weeks in prep
aration for border service and while
awaiting the call of. Gen. Funston,
who will designate such troops as are
test prepared at such times as he may
need additional forces on the border.
"G" Co. is under orders at the
armory and Capt. Wilson is recruit
ing new men rapidly. Capt. Nisbet
is also filling up the vacancies in the
Hospital Corps.
Following is a complete roster of
officers and men, as It stands today,

Thirty-Six Million
Cords of Wood
Wasted Annually
Washington, Jane 20. There
are more than 48,000 sawmills in
the United State?, and their out
put of waste in the form of saw
dust, shavings, slabs, and other
wood- refuse is estimated as 36
million cords per year. TIub iB
equal to over 4 billion cubic
feet of waste, which is the ca
pacity of a' bin one-half mile
high with a base covering a forty
acre lot. Or, considering each
cord to contain eighty cable feet
of solid wood with all the cracks
and air spaces taken out, these
SO million cords wonld make a
block of wood more than a quar
ter of u mile on each edge.
Perhaps one-half of this so-
called waste product is not
strictly speaking wasted, but
serves a useful purpose as fuel
under the boilers. Much of the
remaining 18 million cords not
only servos no useful purpose,
but in most cases is a source of
iuconvenionce and danger, and
costs the mill time and money.
Sawmill waste is disposed of
in various ways. Some goes to
the local fuel market, some to
pulp mills or to wood distillation
plants. Shavings and log cut
tings, as well as other mill waste,
are sometimes used to fill low
places in the yard. However,
the most common method of get
ting rid of waste1 is by burning'
either in a fire-pit having an
open fire which sometimes has a
protecting wall on the side to
wards the mill, or in a burner.
She Always to Blame.
Or what uso Is It discussing whether
men or women will do tbo sillier things
to maintain a poso? Wo all know or
ought to, perhaps that when tho wo
man buys a twolvo dollar pair of whlto
tela boots that aro unsuitable to wear
with anything olso that sho can afford
sho is hcrsolf to blamo; and whon a
man mortgages his farm to buy an nu
tomobllo that ho cannot afford to run
it is tbo women of tbo family who aro
to blamo; and tbero you arol "As She
Scoa It," in Lowell Courier-Citizen.

PLOWBOY FOR
FIFTY
YEARS
Isaac Tucker, of Madisonville,
who is visiting Earlington occa
sionally for treatment at the St.
Bernard hospital, retains his
youthful vigor and irrepressible
good humor remarkably. He de
clared to a friend the other day
that he had "been a plowboy for
fifty years" until this spring and
that be often gets tue fever now
and just wants to get out and fol
low the plow. Bat he is playing
safe now and lets the other fellow
tramp the farrow, while he takes
life easier at the county seat
with his children and friends.
And there is a fine garden spot
be has taken into his fall confi
dence, upon which he works off
his surplus energy and his con
tinuing plowboy ambitions. This
rotund exponent of clean, useful
life and unfailing good cheer is
good to look upon and his friend
ly handgrasp and cheering smile
remniu with us after he has pas
sed by.

NOTICE
I will not be responsible for any
debt made by Mabel Phillips and
charged to me. Some may think
we are still living together because we
board at the same place, but I am
not responsible for her bills.
Sam L. Phillips
Presidential Pointers
The Republican elephant and
the Democratic donkey were
both originated by Thomas Nast
in his cartoons in Harper's
Weekly in 1874. Their concep
tion grow out of a hoax in the
New York Herald to the effect
that the animals of the Central
park menagerie had broken loose
and were wanderinc about tho
city. Soon after, Nast labeled
the two political parties, as well
as the Tammany tiger.
In 1832 Martin Van Buren
was nominated by President
Jackson for the post of minister
to England. He was rejected.
In the coarse of the debate on
his nomination, it was charged
that Van Barea had introduced
in Washington the spoils system
as practiced in New York
politics. Senator William
L. Marcy of New York,
in replying, used the following
language in reference to these
New York politicians: "They
see nothing wrong in the rale
that to the victor belong the
spoils of the enemy."
For the first time there will be
no vacancy in the presidency
next March when the inaugara
tion takes place on the 5th, the
fourth coming on Sunday. If
Mr. Lansing is then secretary of
state he will be acting president.
On three previous occasions the
inangration af a president has
occured on March (5th instead of
the fourth. But no one became
acting president for the 21 hours
because it happened that there
was no president of the senate
pro tempore or speaker of the
house in office on whom the re
sponsibilities would fall previous
to 1880, when the law of succes
sion was changed.
Protracted Meeting .
The Protracted meeting of the
Missionary Baptist church is now
in progress. And we again in
vite the people of our commun
ity to attend these series of meet
ings. Usually people are reluct
ant to come to church on Mon
day evening, yet last night we
had a splendid audience, al
though it was the first night and,
too, the weather was somewhat
inclement. We especially urge
the people to come to the day
services. We shall have service
in the after noon, beginning
promptly at 2:30 oclock. And
the night service beginning at
7:45 o'clock. We shall begin
on the hoar announced.

MR. AND MRS, F, D. RASH ENJOY"
UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AT
LOUISVILLE
Mr. and Mrs. Frank D. Rash
attended laBt week a most un.-.
usual and unique functioa at.
Louisville, a dinner at the Pea
dennis club of alumni of the Mas-
sechasetts School of Technology
which is Mr. Rash's alma mater-
Daring the same hoars gatherings
ot alumni were assembled in all
tho principle cities of the United
States, from coast to coast and
from Dalath to the Gulf of Mex-
ico. For an hoar or more all of
these groups in these scattered
-cities were connected together
upon one great web of trunk line
telephone wires, merged into one
connection at Bopton, where the
celebration centered. Each of
the diners, all over the country,
was supplied with a watch case
telephone receiver through which
was heard the speeches and music
at Boston, Washington and else
where, and all the conversation
between Boston and the connect
ed cities. One of the impressive
features of the evening was the
singing of the "Star Spangled
Banner" led by Washington and
joined by each group of banquets
in all the connected cities, It
was the first time so great and
complete a web of uninterrupted
telephone lines had ever been
connected, and it is unlikely so
cobtly a plan will be repeated
soon. Among the notables whet
were beard on the wires that
night were Alexander Graham
Bell, inventor of the telephone,,
and Thos. A Edison, the invention
wizard of the world.
TEACHERS LEAVE
St. Bernard's School, of this place,
closed on last Friday, June 16,. after
a year of comparative success de
spite the many difficulties under which,
the noble teachers were forced to
labour.
The good nuns who have had
charge of this school for thepast two
years came here from St. Joseph,
Daviess County, Ky., where the.
Mother-house of the Ursulines, and
also one of their splendid academies
is located; they have proven them
selves loyal and efficient teachers in
every respect, and each patron and
pupil, without a single exception feels
indebted to them for their kindness
and fidelity to them, and for their
untiring efforts in their behalf.
A slight manifestation of their ap
preciation of these sisters was shown
by the number of pupils and parents
who assembled at the depot on Sat
urday morning to bid adieu to these
zealous teachers. Although strict
disciplinarians, their rules were obey
ed through motives of love rather
than of fear, since by their kind and
winning ways they have crept into
the hearts of the children, and their
return In September is looked for
ward to eagerly.
