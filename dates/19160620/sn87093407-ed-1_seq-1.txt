Sec'y Lansing Gives Out Text of Reply to Demand for Withdrawal of Troops
PRESIDENT
IS BLUNT IN
ANSWERTO
CARRANZA
WASHINGTON, June
20.—The American gov
ernment today threatened
(ien. Carranza with "the
gravest consequences" if
he attacks American |
troops.
This threat was con
tained in a long note, re
plying to his last with
' drawal demand.
Full of short-arm diplo
matic jabs, the note posi
tively declined to take the
American forces out of
Mexico. It excoriated
Carranra for his failure to
co-operate and resented his
brusqueness and his inti
mations of bad faith.
"Th» de t»cto government Is
pleased to lienor* this obligation"
(to protect American rights sod
chase bandits >. said the note, "and
to beflleve that. In case of a refuaal
to retire the troops, there Is no fur
ther recourse than to defend Its ter
ritory by an appeal to arras, for the
government of the U. 8. would sure
ly be lacking In sincerity and friend
ship If it did not frankly Impress
upon the de facto government that
the eseentlon of this threat will lead
to the gravest consequence*."
Bluntly, the note told Carranza
that this government "cannot rs
eede from Its settled determination
to maintain Its national rights"
and to prevent further raids across
the border.
Main point* In the note are:
—Resentment of Csrrania's dis
courteous tons and tsmpsr In
his last note.
—Charges that bandit* have
gone unhampered and unpunlah
ed In attacking Americana.
—Recitation of instances of
banditry.
—Charges that the Carranza
regime had been indifferent to
atrocities and even encouraged
and aided aoma of tha leader*
•f theae.
—Chart** that Carranxa did
net take proper atapa to appre

Then, aa a proof of absolute

HE TELLS ABOUT ALVIN
Monday afternoon I found
('apt, Alexander In the university

boyish staff, nnd before a desk
littered with papers.
"Have you a moment to talk

The young man pushed aside

"I can usually find time to talk
about Alvln?" he answered.
"What would you like to know?"
"Have you really adopted
him?"
('apt. Alexander laughed nayly.
