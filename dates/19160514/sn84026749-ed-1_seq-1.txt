Capital Needs Social
Survey, Say Leaders
In Civic Preparedness
Noted Sanitarians and Physicians, Who Met in Con
gress jrlere, Declare Much Is to Be Done to Make
Washington Model City Local Legislative
Body Also Necessary, They Assert. ,
-i ; ,
Washington must be made the subject of a thorough and com
prehensive social survey before it can hope to rank as a model com
munity. This is the consensus expressed by many of tho nationally
known social service experts and physicians who were in Washington
during the pastweek attending the
Congress of the American Physicians nad Surgeons and the Tuber
culosis Congress. A
This of course docs not mean that' the city is hopelessly insani
tary, that its housing conditions arc the worst in the country, or that all
or its charitable and corrective institutions arc away below par.
But it does mean that men
medicine and social economics, while
has made marked strides along the
still much to be done before the city
country. '
And among the men who believe this are such authorities as
Homer Folk, secretary o the State Charities and Aid Association of
New York; John M. Glen, director of the Russell Sage Foundation;
Lawrence Veiler, secretary of the National Housing Association of
New York City; and Dr. E. O. Otis, of Boston, who occupied the chair
of pulmonary diseases and climatology in Tufts College medical school.
ANOTHER STEP
And while most of these eminent au
thorities ngrco that a comprehensive
social survey must precede any moral
and economic "Clean-up, and Palnt-up"
campaign for the nation's capital, some
or them go even further:
A few hold that even with such a sur
vey and an application of the results
obtained therefrom, there is yet ano
ther Important step to bo taken.
That, according to the experts, must
be the freeing of Washington from the
domination of a national legislative
body, upon which. In their opinion, no
personal responsibility can rest.
With those things accomplished,

of 'Ceremonies Briefly An
nounced Last Week.
irn Thnm.a p. Moraan. Jr.. and J.
Newton Brewer, two widely known of
the younger men or me city, iw
with two girl students of a faahlon
nMA antninnrv nd were married at Up
per Marlboro, Md, was the subject of
gossip In many quarters toaay, wncn
tho news leaked out.
"No, It wasn't an elopement or
double elopement" persons purporting
to know all about the romance of the
two chums had declared last week when
brief announcements of the two mar
riages were made.
Theso announcements, so brief and
formal, had escaped the glances of most
of the young bridegrooms' friends and
as a cousequenco almost everyone was
Ignorant until the gossips prattle
worked its way around todav.
The Fair Principals.
The other principals of the double
elopement were Miss Helen Woodruff,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. B. Wood
'ruff, of Thomoston, Conn., who Is now
Mrs. Morgan, and Miss Alva Blackburn,
daughter of Dr. Ernest Cecil Blackburn.
of Memphis, and a niece of former
United States Senator J. C. 8, Black
bum, who become Mrs. Brewer.
These facts In the chapter of the
dual romance are borne out by tha
records of the county clerk at jLipper
Marlboro, Md., where the marriage
corcmonlce were performed.
Efforts to communicate with the two
couples today failed, no one. not even
the relatives and Intimate friends of
the bridegrooms, advancing any Infor
mation as to tho whereabouts of Cupid's
victims., uno rnend or Air.. Morgan said
that he presumed the couples wtnf'en

Morgan and Brewer' havo been close

associated with his father In the Insur
ance business In the Southern building.
He Is an) enthusiastic horseman and au
tomoblllst. Ills nonappearance at the
National Capital Horse Show. In which
he had shown great interest and in
wnlch ho had entered several horses,
caused many conjectures by his frionds.
His horse were ridden by a man who
declared at the time. In explanation of
Morgan's absence, that the latter waa
out of the city on business.
Brewer Is associated with Randall
Hagner In the real estate and Insurance
business. He is also an ardent follower
of the horse, and he and Morgan are
leaders In the younger set of the Wash
ington Riding and Hunt Club.
Not until the return of the licenses in
the dual romance was made yesterday
to the clerk at Unner Marlboro who
I Issued them, was anyone able to cor-
roDoraio mo rumor inai tne ceremonies
had taken place.
What Records .Show.
The announcements of the ceremonies
made In the society columns of last
week's newspapers were to the effect
that the Morgan-Wodruff ceremony was
performed at Thomaston; the bride's
home, and the Brewer-Blackburn, one
at Memphis, Tenn., on May 3.
Inquiries at Upper Marlboro elicited
the Information that the licenses were
Issued at that place by James H. Wat
Us, deputy clerk of the court.
The records show that Mr. and Mrs.
Morgan were married by the Rov. Pran
ces K. McManus, pastor of Trinity Epis
copal Church of upper Marlboro,- while
Mr. and Mrs. Brewer, were married by
the Rev. Francis J. Loughrcn, pastor or
St. Mary's Catholic Church or the same
place. The .licenses were issued In tbe
name of T. Philip Morgan, Jr.,- and Jo
seph N. Brewer.
Tho news of tho elopment of the
young people created quite a sensation
when it became known generally. They
did not take even their most intimate
rrlcncs Into their conferences, it is said,
and no one knew that they were In
tel ested particularly in the two school
girls. It is understood that both couples
win return to wasnington.

BRYAN PEACE PACT
WED WITH
State Department Finds Treaty
May Delay 'Settlement' of
Ship Controversy. '
NEW LIGHT ON GERMAN NOTE
Discovery Shows' New Reason
. fpr Demands Made on Ber
lin by Lansing.
The State Department has discovered
that the Bryan peace treaty between
the United States and Great Britain may
operate to delay settlement of the 'con
troversy between tho two countries
growing out of British seizures of ships,
cargoes, and malls.
This places a new light on tho X-
nfenatonr statement made oy Secretary
Lansing, when the last ,ioto was seni
to Germany. In this statement Mr.
Lansing said that one reason the United
States could not couple Its German sub
marine negotiations with representa
tions for relief from the British blockade
was that there were treaty obligations
with Great Britain that limited this
Government's action.
Regardless of this treaty, however, the
American note refused to accept any
submarine concessions from Berlin that
were contingent upon gaining other con
cessions ffom Great Britain.
Threat Must Be Withdrawn.
The fact that Germany apparently
had raised this condition. Secretary Lan
sing said, mado It extremely difficult
now for the United States to proceed
ugulnst Great Britain until the con
ditions were removed. In other words,
the United States could not proceed
until the German threat was withdrawn,
further study of tho Bryan treaty,
however, shows that If it la invoked
by Uroat Britain In the controversy
over the trade and mails blockade,
the United States would be powerless
to proceej) further In urging roller
from these restrictions until tho end
of a year. This probably would de
lay settlement until after tho war..
What Treaty Provides. ,
ThJ3ryan treaty piovtdcj that any
controversy between the two coun
tries, uqt susceptible of diplomatic
settlement, shall bo referred to. on
international commission of five.
whch shall mako a year's investiga
tion and report Until this year enda
neither side may open hostilities.
While toe year'j Investigation Is in
progress the acts complaljied of may
continue.
During such investigation, also, the
United States would be estopped from
taking any measures of reprisal jir
retaliation, such as the cotjon em
bargo which has been urged by Sen
ator Hoke Smith and others.
By calling German 's attention tb
the restrictions imposed upon the
United States by the Bryan treaty,
officials believe much of the crit
icism which has been leveled at the
United States In Berlin for failure to
press as vigorously against Great
Britain as against Germany will be
withdrawn. i
Germany Refused.
The United States also offered to
negotiate a Bryan treaty with Ger
many, but the latter refused. Had.lt
accepted it is possible, the submarine
issue might have been sottled under
tills plan, although Secretary Lanslmr
has expressed doubt whether the
treaty would apply in a case where
American lives wore Involved.
Most of the tension over the Oerman
situation has been relieved. The State
Department believes that the principle
of tho submarine controversy has been
disposed of, and that the slate Is clean
so far as ptst submarine attacks go
except to obtain payment of Indemnity
for Americans killed or Injured.
So long as the war lasts, however, of
ficials realize that tho submarine men
ace will remain, since" there Is always
danger of submarine attack that may
bring tho two nations again Into direct
conillct.
Until such an attack occurs, in the
present view of ofllclals. the submarine
question should not remain an acute
Issue between the two governments.

Reports are expected hourly

the second punitive expedition, out

The forces under General Persh
ing who have besn encamped at

report stated the Americans left
San Antonio last Wednesday and
their camp is being taken by Car
ranza soldiers, who have circulated
the report in Chihuahua that they
forced, the, Americans to retreat M
the Namiquipa base.
It is supposed the troops were
sent back to Namiquipa to shorten
the line of communication. One
reason which has been advanced is
that the rainy season, which begins
about June 22, will paralyze' all

will be necessary to get closer to
