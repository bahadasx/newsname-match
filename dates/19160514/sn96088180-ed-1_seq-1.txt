The Introduction of the above re

the Oregon Stnte Orange late Friday
night was the algnal for the unloos

For four days Grants Pass people hnd

master of the Josephine county
grange,-had expatiated upon the
beauties of his southern Oregon
home country he had thought that
Blanchard had a most wonderful Im
agination, and that the country could
not possibly come up to the glowing
picture. "But I find that the half
was not told," was the way tn which
the committee chairman gave to the
Tonnty grange master a clean bill.
Others tpoke of the cordial and
Trlendly entertainment accorded 1n
'Grants Fass homes, and many friend
ships made during the week will last
through life.
The closing aesslon was given over
' largely to the discussion of resolu

Washington, May 18. The Mex
ican situation today has again sim
mered down to "watchful waiting."
While contraction of the American
lines south of Columbus Is practical
ly accomplished, Major Ianghorne Is
apparently hot on the trail of the
BouqulIIas raiders and Carranxlstas
are marching toward Big Bend,
Texas, with the avowed intention
or cooperating with the United States
column. If nothing untoward occurs,
the expedition hopes for quick
clean-up on the policing of northern
Chihuahua.
The hope of catching Francisco
Villa himself is not great. The big
question now Is, can the Carranxla
tas be checked after they learn that
the American expedition refuses to
withdraw.
Privately, officials said that there
might be an outbreak at any time.
General Hugh Scott Is en route to
Washington with his Information
concerning the situation which will
be used for the guidance of the gov
ernment In further proceedings.
Ambassador Designate Arredondo
is expected to undertake withdrawal
negotiations soon, but his task Is
hopeless, according to persistent re
ports. REPORT VILLA AND
NamlqulpB. Mexico, May 12 (By
Wireless to Columbus, N. M , May

lowers are reported at a ranch near
Carrlr.oxo, forty miles northwest, of
Iji Ascension. The bond was re
ported scattered along Rio Corralltos
and to have been recruited from
Honors, with a sprinkling or Yaquls.
The report aroused little Interest at
headquarters. The re-dlstrlbutlon or

German People Claim to Fee!
Deeply Humiliated That
the Submarine Commander
Should Hav j Deceived Them
The Hague, May 13. Severe pun
ishment has been meted out to the
commander of the German submarine
which attacked the British channel
steamer Sussex and caused great loss
of life, It Is generally believed in
Berlin today, though no official re
port of that nature has been made
public.
The report Is based on popular
indignation at hla act In deceiving the
German naval authorities with re
gard to the vessel which be admitted
attacking. His ' report, saying that
the ship he torpedoed was not the
Sussex, was implicitly believed un
til the United States presented con
clusive evidence to the contrary. In
view or this evidence, the Germans
reel that they have been humiliated,
it Is not overstating the case to say
that his deception caused as much
Indignation in Berlin as in Wash
ington. Germany, desiring to avoid a break
with America at all costs, has taken
two important steps within a fort
night to Improve relations. The sub
marine concessions constituted one
step. The quiet movement to squelch
Teuton plotters and propagandists in
the United States and anti-American
propagandists in Germany constitu
ted the other step. Ambassador Ger
ard recently received Scores or
threats against his life. The writers
wore Insftlred by newHpaer Insinua
tions that he "tipped" the Irish rev
olution to , England. Though Ger
many has disclaimed responsibility
for the German bomb plotters In the
United States, Imperial Chancellor
von Bethmann-llollweg believes that
drnstio moves should be made to con
vince the United States that Germany
bus nothing to do with those ex
tremists. Conferences on this sub
ject have been In progress In Berlin
for a weok.
I' heard, for Instance, that von
Rlntelen will bo courtmartialed if he
returns to Germany. Though officials
will not voice any opinion as to the
guilt ot ths-accused bomb plotters,
they declare that the acts ot these
persons are without the kaiser's sanction.-
Berlin Is chiefly worried over the
possibility that some one may ac-
cidently torpedo without warning . a
merchant ship in the heller that a
transport la being Attacked and thus
precipitate a new American crisis.
The kaiser and hit officials are par
ticularly anxious that submarine com
manders shall take no chances ot In
volving Qermany and the United
States in fresh controversies.
If the new official submarine or
ders could be made public they would
convince the most skeptical that Ger
many it as much concerned as the
United States In preventing future ac
cidents. .
Ambassador Gerard won the hearty
praises ot Berlin for his cool' and
forceful diplomacy. In the U boat
crisis. . Throughout the negotiations,
he worked ceaselessly to convince
German officials that the president
did not want war, but expected Ger
many to keep her promises.
Indicating that it Is Germany's
sincere desire to avoid a break, the
German government asked five de
partments what to do when Wilson's
ultimatum was received.
The foreign department, the trea
sury and the Interior departments
answered. "Settle honorably It pos
sible" The war and navy depart
ments answered, "Settle without en-

The city of Juarez lost most of its
