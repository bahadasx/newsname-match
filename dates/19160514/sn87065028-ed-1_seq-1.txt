The Columbus Railway, Light and
Power Company, which for the past
seven years has been owned by a
corporation jointly controlled by
- local and eastern men, has been pur
chased by Memphis capitalists the
new organization being headed by
R. W. Fant, who is a native of Mis
sissippi, having been born at Holly
Springs, but who for a number of
years past has been residing in the
Bluff City.
Mr. Fant has been elected presi
dent to succeed Mr. C. F. Sherrod,
and all of the new directors are res
idents of other cities, though it is
said that local men will b.ier be
given places on the board.
Messrs. E. J. Lens and Mr. R. B.
Claggett, both of whom reside at
Greenville, Miss., will have immed
iate supervision over the nronertv.
ar i r iitt or the other j)f these gen
tlemen will be in Columbus most
of the time.
It is said that improvements in
.the property will be made from
time to time as conditions permit,
though it is also stated that on ac
count of the fact that it is at pres
ent impossible to purchase electrical
equipment of any character, these
improvements will not be at once
undertaken.
The change in management be
comes effective immediately.
Mr. Chas. Hays will be retained as
superintendent, and it is to be hoped
that the people of Columbus will co-
nnpratn with him in Vila omlonvnr M
serve them well and faithfully. Any
suggestions that the ' people may
have for the betterment of the ser
vice will be gladly received by Mr
Hays and his fellow workers.
Messrs. Claggett and Lenz hold
important executive positions with
the Delta Light and Power Com
pany at Greenville and the Lake Vil
lage Light and Power Company at
Lake Village, Ark.( and state thti
' the patrons of both companies are
well satisfied with the service given
them. In discussing the' transfc of
the local property, Mr. Claggett
said:
"Mr, C. F. Sherrod, the retiring
president, showed the new organi
zation every possible courtesy dur
ing the . re-organization, and they
wish to thank him for his most able
assistance in helping them take over
the property. Mr. Sherrod is a man
of large interests in this community,
and it was with real regret that the
new management accepted his resig
nation. Furthermore, he is a man
who has enjoyed the confidence of
this community for a great many
years, and it is earnestly hoped that
the new management will shortly be
able to have that same confidence
bestowed on them."

The attraction at the Princes3

gowns that are worn by the star,
Gladys Hanson, who is one of the
most beautiful women on the stage

"The Climbers" is a story of so

chants and deceit of high society;
interwoven with a pretty romance,
it affords unlimited opportunity for
the display of big, massive settings,
and beautiful gowns.
The company selected to support

Fflffl RECUR LOST
GER.MANS SWITCH ATTACKS TO
BRITISH FRONT NEAR
HELLUCH.
London, May 13. Switching their
attack from the Verdun region
against the French, the Germans
have begun a sharp offensive against
the British line around Hulluch.
Proceeding their movements with
the usual heavy bombardments,
the Germans launched an infantry
attack against the lines of the I'hit-
ish in the region of Vermelles and
were successful in capturing first
line trenches over a front of about
500 yards. The British admit the
loss of the position, but say that a
purt of them were retaken in a
counter attack.
Berlin declares that in their de
fense of the trenches, and especial
ly later in the counter attacks, the
British suffered heavy casualties
and in addition lost men taken
prisoners and several machine guns
captured.'
Around Verdun, the French on
the left bank of the Meuse have re
captured points of vantage pre
viously taken from them southeast
of Haucourt by the Germuns. Bom
bardments are again taking place
in the vicinity of Le Mort Homme
and Cummeries, and against the
French first and second line of
trenches on the right bank of the
Meuse between the Haudromont
wood and Vaux. A German attack
south of Fort Douaumont was re
pulsed. Considerable infantry fighting,
which as yet has been without re
sult, is in progress on the Dvinsk
and Jacobstadt sectors on the Rus
sian front. Petrograd reports that
German attacks here and farther
south have been repulsed.
In the Austro-Itulian theatre in
tense artillery actions are ensuing
in the Col Di Lana zone, and the
Italians have put down two A us-
trian attempts at attack against
captured positions on Mount Culka.

Speakers Urge Promotert to
Get Busy, and Build Road
Without Further Delay.
Good roads enthusiasts from Log
town to the Alabama line came to
Columjbua in both motor and steam
cars to attend the meeting which
was held here Thursday to boost
the central Mississippi route for the
proposed Jackson Highway, prac
tically every county in the state
which the route traverses having
been represented. Most of the del
egations contained members of the
boards of supervisors of the differ
ent counties represented, and this
fact, as well as the fact that all of
the counties reported good progress
and many reported the work as be
ing wholly completed within their
borders, shows that the boosters are
thoroughly in earnest and are de
termined to have the highway com
pleted by October 1, the date set
by the executive committee for de
termining whether the route in
question or the one which traverses
Alabama shall be officially desig
nated as the Jackson Memorial
Highway.
The meeting convened at the
court house at 2 o'clock Thursday
afternoon, and was presided over by
Hon. R. T. Simpson, of Florence,
Ala., president of the Jackson Mil
itary Highway Association, who was
tntroduced by Mr. W. H. Carter.for
mer secretary of the Columbus
ChuOiber of Commerce. Hr. A. W.
Milner, of Florence, secretary of the
organization,' was unable to be
present, and his duties were most
acceptably performed by Hon. J.
M. McBeath, of Meridian.
In delivering the address which
formerly opened the meeting Mr.
Simpson urged his hearers to go to
work and get the route through
central Mississippi completed with
out further delay. "The time for
dreams has passed," he said, "the
time for real work is just before you
get over the hill, and this period is
now at hand." He urged the men
and the head of the government to
get together and at once construct
continuous symetrical highways, not
contenting themselves with a series
of rough, narow, unconnected
country roads, which, he said, would
be sure to be turned down by the
government engineers selected to
finally designate the official route.
Another excellent speech was
made by Hon. Cliff Williams of Mer
idian, who is recognized throughout
the state not only as one of its most
enthusiastic good roads boosters
but as one of its most entertainng
and extemporaneous speakers. "If
we keep on flirting with ourselves
and telling each other what we are
going to do," said Mr. Williams,
"when the time comes for the en
gineers to make their final decision
regarding the route of the Jackson
Memorial Highway we will get noth
ing more than an honorable men
tion. Wre should not only build the
highway without any longer delay

Running Down Banditt.
Washington, May 12. After
President Wilson and his cabinet
had discusser" the report of General
Scott on the border conference,
which ended in a deadlock yesterday,
it was officially stated that the fail
ure of the loncerees to reach an
agreement had brought no change
in the policy toward Mexico of the
Washington administration.
There wa3 no evidence among ad
ministration officials of greatly in
creased concern over the events at
the border .t in Mexico. President
Wilson left for a week-end trip
down the Potomac and Secretary
Baker went to New Jersey, to be
gone until Sunday.
The text vf General Scott's re
port of his final discussion has not
been made public. There are indi
cations, however, that he arrived at
something like a gentleman's un
dertanding with the Mexicnn war
minister, though it possibly had no
more definite form than a state
ment by each side of what steps it
proposed ty take toward checking ,
raiding along the Texas border.
Pending new orders from the Pres
ident it was made plain at the war
department that Gen. Pershing's
expedition v;ould remain in Mexico.
Meanwhile mobilization of national
guardsmen from the border states
and Jid'Monal regulars to
strengthen tjhc border patrol con
tinues. Should raiding be renewed
additional state troops will be re
called and whenever the bandits
leave a hot trial the army will pur
sue them into Mexico.
An indication of the attitude of
some of the members of Congress"
toward General Carranza's sug
gestion that the American expedi
tion be recalled, came in the Senate
today when Senator Lewis declared
that he believed that n majority of
the Senate never would vote for
withdrawal until the murderers of
Americans had been punished. He
was replying to a suggestion of
Senator Kenyon's that nothing ade
quate was being done to safeguard
the soldiers now in Mexico. Senator
Lewis declared that the war depart
ment was taking every possible
precaution.
Movements of Carranza troops
toward the Big Bend region were
assumed here to be directed toward
an effort to round up the Glenn
Springs raiders from the south,
while American forces are pressing
them from the north.

Afternoon and evening concerts

first Chautauqua ever held in this
city and the series of entertainments
on the five days' program were high
ly enjoyed by the large crowds who
each day attended the performances.
The attractions which have been
furnished by the Redpath Lyceum
Bureau, of Chicago, have proven so
succssful that it is now almoest a
certainty that the chautauqua will
be seen again in this city next sum
mer. Up to last night nearly three
hundred citizens of the city had
pledged themselves to purchase sea
son tickets for next year, and a
number of business men have guar

to secure the attraction in lit 17.
On Thursday afternoon Dr. Fred

delivered an interesting lecture on
"The Golden Fleece," and a pro

Friday was "Health Day," the
principal speaker being Dr. Charles

to Hon. Wtn.,H. Taft, while he nerv

He delivered two lectures, one in

Negro Seriously Injured.
John Sykes, an aged nevrro living
on the McGee plantation near Bent
Oak, was seriously and probably fa
tally injured about 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon when he was knocked
out of a buggy in which he was rid
ing. The accident, which occured on
the Tombigbee river bridge, was
caused by a collision between a
runaway team hitched to a v.T.gon
and driven by Mr. O. L. Botts, n
well known planter of the southern
part of the county, and the vehicle
in which the negro was riding.
