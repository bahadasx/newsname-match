LINCOLN. Neb., May 13. In a
signed article published today.
William Jennings I'.ryan declares the
Democratic party must, in order to
win the coming campaign, "move to
ward peace" and thereby capture the
peace element in the Republican
party. Me begins his article by quot
ing from a Chicago newspaper a edi
torial, lnwhlch Mr. Wilson Is called
a minority president, in that he re
ceived fewer votes than Roosevelt
and Tart combined and says the
Democrats must face the fart that a
united Republican party will enter the
campaign with a popular majority ol
1,300,000 votes.
Continuing, he says:
"To the normal Republican advan
tage must bo added tho disaffection
among German and Irish Democrats.
Without attempting to decide whether
the president was wise or unwise in
taking the course that alienated them
the party is confronted with the fact
that this alienation will cost tt a large
number of votes enoiiRh to defeat
the party In several close states.

"From what source can we draw
the number of recruits necessary to
give the party a fighting chance?
From one source and from one source
only: namely, the pence clement of
the Republican party; we cannot
draw votes from the war element.
"There is a peace element in tho
Republican party as shown by tho
vote cast for Henry Ford In Michigan,
Nebraska ana other states. This is
tho only element to which the Demo
cratic party can appe il and to appeal
to this element It will be necessary to
