Tall athletes, short athletes, thin ones,
fat ones; athletes wearing every color
of the rainbow and a few colors not in
the rainbow; athletes from high schools
in every part of the Mate they were
all on Kollins Field yesterday after
noon, striving to pile up points for
themselves and the folks back home.
.More than 300 high school students
were entered in the thirteenth annual
interscholastic meet.
The first heat in the 100-yard dash
was run off at 2 o'clock. When the
last man had taken his try at the broad
jump at about 0:30 o'clock, three state
records had fallen and one had been
tied.
Only three schools were entered in
Class A. Kemper .Military Academy
placing highest with a total of CO 1-2
points, twenty more than gained by
Wentworth, the nearest competitor and
Kemper's rival.
Westport Wins In Class 15.
Westport High School, Kansas City,
with a well-balanced team that cap
tured plenty of seconds and thirds,
took first in Class B, with 29 1-2
points.
Harrisonville High School, chiefly
through the efforts of two men, led in
Class C, in which the largest number
of schools were entered.
Individual honors for the day went
to Williams, a .Mount Vernon youth,
who captured IS 1-2 points for his
team, by winning three firsts, tieing
for 2 1-2 points in the high jump and
placing fourth in the broad jump. "A
second Simpson" was the way this all
around lad was characterized by the
crowd that watched the efforts of to
morrow's stars. Marshall Haddock of
Kansas City Polytechnic School and
Wilson of Kemper pressed Williams
closely for the honors. The Kansas
City boy, a brother of "Cupid" Had
dock, former Kansas track captain and
record holder, showed his versatility
by entering in both the sprints and the
weight events. He amassed a total of
17 points.
I.',-Year-Old Wilis Honors.
Other high point winners were Cas
tle of St. Joseph Central, with 15, and
Gray and Hamilton of Harrisonville,
with 12 and 10 points respectively.
The latter is only 15 years old.
When Marshall of Manual High,
Kansas City, heaved the 12-pound shot
4S feet 3 inches, he broke the record
of a man known all over the country
as one of the world's greatest weight
tos.-ers. It was back in 190G that Lee
Talbot, also a student in Manual, es
tablished the mark of 46 feet C 1-2
inches that has held until this year.
This same boy Marshall shattered the
record for the discus throw when he
threw the plate 117 feet 10 inches,
breakinc bv four inches the mark
made by Kanatzer of Kansas City Man
ual in 1909.
The half-mile relay record, of 1:36
3-5, credited to Sedalia in 1911, went
by the boards when the Webster
Groves quartet negotiated the distance
in 1:35 3-5.
Coffin, a sensation from Northeast
High. Kansas City, led runners from
both A and B classes In the half
mile, finishing in 2:03 1-5, tying a 1907
record made by Keiffer of St. Louis
