three refineries of from five to
ten thousand barrels capacity
daily, the board of directors of
the chamber of commerce and
the business men's association
met yesterday morning for the
purpose of bringing one of the
refineries to this city if possible.
Mr. van Wijk, who has
charge of the Roxana interests
in this field was at the meeting
and briefly stated what was es
sential for the location of the
refinery, and the conditions im
posed were in the main so rea
sonable that he was virtually
assured that Ardmore would
meet them.
The main feature was an ad
equate water supply as the
plant would need something
like sixteen hundred barrels
flnilv. He was assured that this
was an easy condition to meet
and that the city council would
be seen with a view to allowing
them to install their own line
and pumping station at the
lake and get the water free of
charge, or they would furnish
the water at actual pumping
charges. The matter of a site
was also taken up and Mr. van
Wijk will receive from a com
mittee appointed an option of
a little more than a hundred
acres of land at once.

The Cosden Refinery.
Embodied In the press report re
ceived Friday was a well founded ru
mor that the Cosden Company, one

and comprising some of the best pro
duction in the field. A telegram was
Bent to the Cosden Company yes
terday offering its good offices to se
cure all that was necessary for the
plant to be located here. It is expect
ed that some reply will be received

joint meeting of the directors of the

WHO VAS CONVICTED OF KILL
ING TEACHER, WAS SENTENCED

son, the 17-year-old school boy, was
given a twenty-five-years sentence
today for killing Prof. James G.
Wright in school at Newport, near

RANGES, ETC.
FRIDAY EVENING DR. WILLIAMS
CONTINUING HIS ADDRESS ON
AMUSEMENTS, SPOKE PLAINLY
AND WITH CONVICTION.
Little time was spent last Friday
night in preliminaries at the taber
nacle meiting. Dr. Williams pau.-ed
, Iniiir ennuiih to answer a few cues-
' "
tions. and then plunged into the dis
cussion of shows and dances, being
a part of t ho general subject of amuse
ments, continued rrom Thursday
night. The question, "Why is it
necessary to discuss amusements be
fore church members," Dr. Williams
answered by saying that many Chris
tian people by the assertion of their
liberty may injure themselves, and
others also, and that if they are
shown wherein the danger lies they
will gladly give them up, because
,
they are Christians and want to
be
on the; right side and honor their
Master. A most pathetic letter writ
ten by a young man of this city
was read by Dr. Williams, stating his
spiritual condition, and asking if
there was any hope for him. It
touched the hearts of the congrega
tion, and many silent prayers rose
to the Savior for him and all like
him.
In his address, Dr. Williams began
by saying that many people join the
church without any idea of self-sacrifice
on their part, and as a conse-
1 quence, low ideals in religion pre
i vail and worldly conformity weakens
j the power of the church. "Be not
! conformed to this world" is the in
spired injunction. Church people do
not qualify for service. Very evi-
something is wrong with Ard
religiously. It is the duty of
thpge paators cnUrch officials, church
.... .... j.
members, Sunday school teachers and
the evangelist to find out just as
quickly as possible. We cannot ig
nore the situation or shut our eyes
to it and be guiltless before God. We
must do our duty or bear the conse
quences. The situation is alarming.

HEALING OF SOLDIERS' WOUNDS
SHORTENED BY MANY DAYS.
Paris, Miy 13. The new Cam 11
treatment of soldiers' wounds has
brought about a reduction of the period
of convalescence, according to a re
port now submitted by Dr. Ufholtz,
chief surgecn of a division of the
French army. Under this process em
ployed by Dr. Alexis Carrell. the re
port declares, the time required for
the healing of wounds has been short
ened to sixteen days in extreme cases,
as compared with three months. On
the average the period of evolution of
the wounds is reduced about two
thirds. The great advantage of the use of
hypochlorite of soda for the continual
washing of the wounds is that it ac
celerates wonderfully the progress of
healing to the point where the edges
of the wound may be brought to
gether by stitching or by adhesive
bandages. In some cases Dr. Uffbolz
has noted that a disinfection of from
7 to 9 days with this process has been
sufficient to permit the closing of the
, wound.
