Townley's $378,000 List of Judg*
ments Shows His Capa­
city.
SOME CHECKS ARE .f
COMING BACK
No Financial Report Has Been
Made to the League
Members
Fargo, N. D., May 13.—The mem­
bers of.the Non-partisan league who
have signed its application blank and
have paid their dues are liable for
the debts of that organization. This
is the decision of able lawyers, one
of whom collected judgments from
104 farmers in 'North Dakota under
circumstances very similar.
A Partnership/
The Non-partisan league is not in­
corporated, but it is doing business
and every member as above described
ranks as a partner, although only the
"executive committee" has anything
to say about expending the money.
The attorneys say:
"Every partner is liable for the acts
of another, and the acts of a partner
bind the Arm and each individual,
and the league ranks as a partner­
ship."
Farcical Examination.
The so-called examination of the
accounts during the convention at
•Fargo resulted in a statement of about
three sentences in which the "aud
tiors" stated that the money had been
properly1 expended. The Pierce Coun­
ty Tribune wittily says: "Not a
farmers' telephone company any­
where would have accepted such an
"audit."
Rumors of Impending Crash.
Many checks issued by the league
were turned down by the banks and
marked, "N.
IS.
P.," at the time of the
big convention. The latter was a ne
,,cestdtytoriiiHe money and .brought in
soinetSfng like $40iWHh This helped
some^Ut indications are that ft"crisis
.Is.again approaching. The threat of
starting a new daily newspaper has
not been carried out and various chat­
tel mortgages filed on the component
parts .-of the Non-partisan Leader indi­
cate,'(hat all is not clear sailing.
..,Truth Becoming Known.
Attacks, made toy II. T. Quanbeck,
O. iS^rlie, W. C. 'Burnett and Sena­
tor W. iMartln have shaken con­
fidence in the management. The pho­
to-engraving part of the Leader's busi­
ness is being transferred to a hold­
ing company, organized by Townley.
Coates and Linden, under the name cf
the Dakota Engraving company. Evi­
dently the name, '*Non-partisan Lead­
er" is becoming odoriferous.
And the discussion of Townley's
record has brought out the facts con­
cerning his plunging and the immense
debts piled up in the western part of
the state. As the members of the
league come to know these facts and
to realize that they are responsible
for the debts Townley and his coad­
jutors may pile up they are exceed­
ingly uneasy.
Townley's Financial Record.
Townley is said to have gone to
Colorado after his ventures in North
Dakota, and there he fell in with
Coates, who came at his call to this
state when informed that the picking
was good. Coates brought with him a
number of other carpetbaggers. Town
ley's financial record in Montana and
Colorado has not yet been secured,
but in Golden Valley and MoKenzie
counties North Dakota the records

HIHER'S DAY ill
BE E
Dry Instituted by Miss Anna
Jarvis Will Be Fitingly
Observed.
Mother's Day will be fittingly ob­
served in the capital city by special
sermons and song services in the va­
rious churches, and by the weaftftg of
a flower for the best mother in the
world—your mother.
Mother's Day was instituted by
Miss Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia,
iPa., in 1908, when she wore a white
carnation in honor of her mother's
'birthday. On this ocasion Miss Jar­
vis announced her plan for a national
observance of the day. The next
year Miss Jarvis' propaganda had
progressed so far that Philadelphia
observed the day in {(he church and
the home.
'Since then the movement has
spread, until it is observed in nearly
all parts of the United 'States.
The white carnation was chosen as
the emblematic flower, because of its
purity and sweetness and because it
grows in every part of the country
and can readily be procured in early
May, but any flower id appropriate.
Through Miss Jarvis' efforts. Sena­
tor Burkett of (Nebraska introduced a
resolution suggesting that the second
Sunday in 'May be created a holiday
in honor of mothers and, although
other senators derided 'Burkett when
he introduced the subject many news­
papers endorsed it. Since then gov­
ernors of many states have issued
proclamations asking the people to
observe the day, until now it has 'be­
come a national day of praise to
IMother.
Hundreds of flowers were sold in
the city yesterday for the day, the
demand far exceeding the supply.
Many were unable to get their favor
Ite flower.

READERS OF TRIBUNE
URGED TO VOTE THEIR
PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE
MY CHOICE FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
Second Choice
Cut out and mail or bring to TRIBUNE Office, Bismarck,
N. D, not later than Friday, May 19.
We hope that every reader of to­
day's issue of The Tribune will cut
out the above coupon and indicate
on it' his choice for the 'Republican
Presidential nomination. According
to the view of many Republicans the
nomination will go either to Colonel
Roosevelt or to Justice Hughes. But
there is un open field in our primary.
Vote for tbe man whose name you
would like best to see at the head of
the Republican ticket. Give your sec­
ond choice also, for second choices
are of great value in averaging up
party sentiment.
The Tribune is conducting this test
vote out of a sense of duty to its con­
stituency. Most of our readers are
Republicans. Yet in this state—and
in practically all the other states—
circumstances have prevented satis­
factory use of the primary election
machinery. Colonel Roosevelt and
Justice Hughes have refused to let
their names go on the official ballots.

They are. not and will not be candi­
dates for the Presidential nomination.
They are not seeking to have dele­
gates Instructed for them. As a conse­
quence the great' majorjty of the dele­
gates so far elected to the Chicago
convention have been unlnstructed.
They will have to interpret the senti­
ments of the voters they represent
as best they can. Every unofficial
poll like ours will help them to act
moro intelligently and justly.
The Republican National Conven­
tion this year must re-establish once
iiioi the party's reputation for sa­
gacity, /for capacity to lead and gov­
ern. The delegates themselves will
be on trial at Chicago. They need
all the enlightenment they: can get.
Every Republican, every citizen who
hoped to see the principles of Amer­
icanism revitalized and triumphant in
tbe next election should do his part
to make the tatk of the Republican
National Convention as clear and sim­
pleas possible.

ground about 30 feet below. The driv­
er was impaled on an upright piece
of timber and was. killed instantly.
Pallotti died on the way to the Coney
Island Hospital. The machine, one of
three French cars imported for the
race, crumbled under the impact and
burst into flames.
Wife In Grandstand.
Limberg's wife was irt the grand­
stand. As. the car dashed by she
missed her husband's machine and
realized that he was the victim of the
accident. An attendant escorted her
from the stand, and an automobile
carried her to the hospital as she was
told Linnberg had liflen taken there.
Not until she reacl.ftd there did she
learn that he Pew of-ihosr^
in the stand knew tifjtil the race-, was

London, May 13.—The Germans
continue their efforts to force through
the French lines at Verdun. Attacks
against the French positions west of
Hill 304. and the slope northeast of
Lemort Homme were repulsed accord­
ing to latest official 'French state­
ment. The German? made three at­
tacks against British trenchies between
the river Somme and Maricourt. In
one attack, London states the Ger­

trench but were driven out.
Petrograd reports further progress
for the Russians in Armenia. A pow­

by the Russians.
The successful conclusion of a two

[HI COMPLAINT DUE
ERSTi
to
Washington, May 15'.—War depart
ment officials believe the complaint
of the iRock Island machinists is due
to a misunderstanding of the order
of the department of labor, on which
a new scale of wages is to be pro­
vided. Col. Burr telegraphed that the
men had pvesented a demand that
wages be based on the labor depart­
ment's recommendation squaring with
scales in effect in Chicago. General
Crozier, chief of ordnance, replied
that the labor department had not
recommended that the wages ibe
squared .with those in Chicago.
ON RECORD FOR
IE
Mcnster Parade Said to Be Larg­
est in History of Country
Is Held
GOVERNOR WHITMAN IS
"INSPIRED WITH PRIDE"
New York, May 145.—New York e*
pressed its attitude on the question
of national preparedness today iby
holding the greatest civic parade in
the history of the country. An al
most countless host of men and wom­
en, estimated at more than 150,000,
representing all walks of life, in the
nation's metropolis, marched for 12
hours, 20 abreast, behind jbands, play
ing patriotic airs, through flag-be
decked streets, lined with thousands
of cheering spectators. All the pro
fessions and trades which make up
the complex life of the city were rep­
resented.
Cosmopolitan Throng.
In one division were the street
sweepers in the it uniforms of white,
while iu another were ttav dignified
justice* of the uupronte cotvt of New
"TfrrKr
Thef^%^err«-a^«e--oleriK(
representing every denomination in
the city. Lawyers, pljysicians and
trained nurses, veterans of the Span
ish-American war, all were in lino.
But the most popular division was
made up of the city's 10,000 National
Guardsmen, cavalry and artillery,
who brought up the tear.
"This," declared Wajor 'General
Wood, in command of the department
of the east, who reviewed the pa­
rade, "is the greatest argument Am­
erica has ever known in favor of pre­
paredness against elements that are
at present unknown."
The paraders marched rapidly,
more than 10,000 passing a given
point within an hour.
Viewed by Governor.
Governor Whitman, who viewed the
demonstration from a balcony of the
Union League club, declared it was
the most remarkable example of pa­
triotism and civic pride he ever had
witnessed.
"Speaking as a citizen," said the
governor, "I should say that every
New Yorker who saw the parade
should have :been inspired with
pride."
BIG FOREST FIRE.
Santa Fe, N. M., May 13.—A forest
fire burned over 2500 acres in the
Jemez division of the Santa Fe na­
tional forest, and on adjoining lands
of the Baca Location and the Santa

rangers and employes extinguished
the fire early today. The extent of
the damage is not yet known.

For Preparedness.
Washington, D. C., May 13.—lA
standing army of 206,000 men, cap­
able of being expanded in emergency
to 254,000, and backed by a Federal­
ized National Guard of 425,000 as a
reserve, finally was agreed upon to­
day by House and Senate Conferees
on the army bill. The agreement will
be reported to Congress early next
week, and the measure, the first of
the administration's preparedness
bills is expected to he before Presi­
dent Wilson for his signature soon
afterwards.
Make Compromise.
Advocates of adequate national de*
fonse, regard this conference agree­
ment, as a triumph. The compromise
between the House and Senate meas­
ures was effected after weeks of trou­
ble, after insistent demands of the
House conferees for a standing army
of 140,000-men and until today it bad
appeared the Senate might be forced
to yield. Tbe Senate bill provided
for 150,000. a I

iMarathon, Texas, May 13.—Fifty
miles south of the Mexican border
from Boquilles, Major Langhorne halt­
ed Boquilles raiders tonight to await
the arrival of Col. Frederick W. Sib­
ley and three troops of the 14th Cav­
alry.
Earlier in the day advance scouts
of Major Langhorne's squadron met
with several Mexican cowboys and
learned that the bandits were concen­
trated about 50 miles southward and
numbered over 500. Upon receipt of
this news, 'Major Langhorne sent a
courier to advise General Sibley, com­
mander of the expedition. It was
learned that Col. Sibley decided to
cross with the 14th Cavalry, leaving
a small garrison at Boquilles, the sub
base, and to push on w^-all speed,
in the hope that Major Langhorne
would not attack until he arrived.
iRumor Denied.
Columbus, N. M., May 13.—'Detach*
ments of cavalry patroling the New

Colonel H. G. Sickle, commanding the
patrol, that investigations disclosed
nothing to support the rumor report­
ed today from field headquarters that
Villa was hiding in the mountains of
northern Chihuahua.
Military men here were inclined to
place credence in the rumor, which
said that Villa had concentrated 1100
men about seven miles south of Hati

west of Ascension, Chihuahua.
