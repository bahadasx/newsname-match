Obregon Sends Troops to Par
ral and Big Bend Country
to Help Americans Protect
Border.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. .May 13. Indica
tions reached the War Department to
day that the Scott-Obregon border
conferences, although officially de
scribed as having erided in a deadlock
actually had resulted in -closer coop
eration between the American and
Carranza forces In Mexico, and there
were intimations that no written a
greement had been drawn up by the
conferees because they decided more
could be accomplished .without it.
General Scott telegraphed that Gen
cral Obregon had indicated a fear as
to the effect a formal agreement
might have in regard to American
troops on Mexican soil on the Mexi
can public opinion, in view of Getyral
Carranza's request that American
troops be recalled, presented more
than a month ago. This generally
was accepted here as explaining the
failure of the conferees to go further
than an unwritten gentleman's a
greement as to the methods of coop
oration in the campaign against the
. bandits.
Evidence that thi9 agreement was.
being carried out came today in of
ficial telegrams reporting the move
ment of both American and Carranza
troops. General Scott telegraphed
that he had assurances from General
Obregon that Carranza commanders
had been ordered to campaign against
bandits, both about Parral and along
the Coatuila-Chihuahua borders in
the region -f the Big Bend raids. Gen
oral Pershing reported in accordance
with instructions following the border
conferences, he was shortening the
American line of communication and
drawing in his scouting on patrols, j
Officials here believe that Namiquipa
Foon will b abandoned as his field
base. Today was taken to indicate,
early retirement of the head of the
American forces to Colonia Dublan.
General Pershing also reported that
there were no Mexican forces in hie
vicinity.
With Carranza troops advancing to
ward the border and joining in the
Big Bend region reports from General
Funston indicated that American op
erations there were attaining consid
erable magnitude. An entire motor
truck company has been tranferred
from Columbus to Marathon, Texas, to
form the line between Marathon as
the base, and Major Langhorne's
troopers pureuing the bandits who
raided Boquillas and Glenn Springs.
While cooperative military move
ments are proceeding, diplomatic ne
gotiations for a formal agreement cov
ering the American expedition are ex
pected to be resumed next week be
tween Eliseo Arredondo and Secretary
Lansing. General Scott will return
Monday from the border to report to
Secretary Baker and Secretary Lan
sing. That General Carranza is wait
ing for Washington to make the next
move was indicated today by Mr Ar
redondo and by Special Agent Rod
gers at Mexico City. The former
Faid he was awaiting instructions and
Mr. Rodgers telegraphed that General
Carranza had not indicated that he
would make immediate renewal of his
demand for withdrawal.
Use of the Mexican railways for the
transportation of American soldiers
as well as supplies probably would be
one of the prominent points urged by
the United States in the negotiations.
The advent of the rainy season in
northern Mexico, impeding motor
truck transportation, emphasizes the
need of the railways, although it was
officially stated tonight that every
pound of cfc--alry forage which has
reached General Pershing since es
tablishment of his advanced base had
been sent over the railways through
private shippers.
That customs restrictions which
have prevented shipment of ammuni
tion to Carranza authorities would be
contnued while the liplomatjc nego-
tiations proceeded was also staged.
Policy which has stopped all muni
tions shipments across the border
since the American expedition was
launched, had not been changed. Or
ders issued today permitting General
Pershing .to convene general court
martial, were officially explained as
calculated only to provide a means of
dealing with infractions of military

GENERAL BELL CALLS
IT GREATEST EVER
Two Hundred Ministers of All
Denominations March By
Side of Judges and 10,000
National Guardsmen.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, May 13. New York
expressed its attitude on the question
of national preparedness Today by
holding the greatest civic parade in
the history of the country. An al
most countless host of men and wo
men, estimated at more than 150,000,
representing all walks W life in the
nation's metropolis, inarched for 12
hours, 20 abreast behind bands play
ing patriotic airs through flag-bedecked
streets lined with hundreds of thou
sands of cheering spectators. All the
profess.'jns and trades which make up
the complex life of the city were
represented.
In one division were the street
sweepers in their uniforms of white,
while in another were the dignified
justices of the supreme court of New
York. There alsM were the clergy
nearly 200, representing every deno
mination in the nation's greatest city.
Lawyers, physicians, trained nurses,
veterans of. the Spanish-American
war all were in line. But the most
popular division was made up of the
city's 10,000 national guardsmen, in
fantry, cavalry and artillery who
brought up the rear.
"This." declared Ma?or General
Leonard Wood, in command of the
department of the east, who reviewed
the parade, "Is the greatest argument
America has ever known in favor of
preparedness against elements that
are at present unknown. This is
what we need. It shows that the
time has t'jme to do something in
the matter of national preparedness."
The great civic army began march
ing at 9:30 a. m. and the last of them
had not passed the reviewing stand in
Madison Sauare Garden until 9.39
o'clock tonight.
Just as Mayor John Mitchell and
a party of municipal officers left the
citv hall at the head of the tret
division, an aeroplane appeared above
lower Broadway and hovered around
the grand stand. The paraders
marched raoidly. more than 10.000
passing a given point within an hour.
With few exceptions the marchers
carried small American "ir. The
women's div'n. estimated to num

(By Review Leased Wire.) j
LINCOLN, May 13. In a signed!
article; published today. W. J. Bryan '
declares the Democratic party must,
in order Tj win the coming campaign,
"move toward peace" and thereby
capture the peace element in the Re
publican party. He begins his article
by quoting from a Chicago newspaper
editorial in which Mr. Wilson is
called a minority president, in that
he received fewer votes than Roose
velt and Taft combined and says the
Democrats must face the fact that a
united Republican party will enter tiie
campaign at a popular majority of
1,300,000 votes. Continuing he says:
"To the normal Republic-nil .advant
age must be added the dissatislaction
among German and Irish Democrats.
Without attempting Vo decide whether
the President was wise or unwise in
taking the course that alienated them,
the party is confronted with ihe fact
that this alienaion will cost it a large
number of votes enough to defeat
the party in several close states.
"Fi'jm what source can we ' draw
the number of recruits necessary to
give the peace element, of the Repub
lican party; we catinot draw votes
from war element.
"There is a peace element in the
Republican party as shown by the
vote cast for Henry Ford in Michigan,
Nebraska and other states. This is
the 'only elemtn to which the Dem
ocratic party can appeal and to ap
peal to this element it will be neces
sary to do more than has yet been
done. If any considerable number of
Republicans felt friendly to the Presi
dent they would have sL'jwn it by
writing in his name as their choice
when they expressed themselves at
the primary.
"If this element is to be concentrat
ed it must be done by a move toward
peace. The oppor unity is here. The
German government, in accepting this
government's I'jsition in the submar
ine controversy gives as one of its
reasons for doing so its unwillingness
to be responsible for extending or
spreading the war. It refers to the
fact that it has twice expressed a
desire to consider terms of peace.
They way is open. Will the President
take advantage of the opportunity?
Failure to secure peace terms w'juld
bring no humiliation while success
would be of tremendous advantage to
him politically, as well as a blessing
to his country and the w'jrld. He can
at one stroke destroy all the advant
age the Republican party now has
and make the race on the record of
a peace maker.
"Will he give voice t'j the world's
conscience to humanity's hope?"
FRANCHISE HELD VALID
BY SUPREME COURT
Decision Holds That Improve
ment Company's Franchise
is Good; Question in the
Courts Five Years.
The Supreme Court at Pl.'jenix on
Friday handed down a decision i!i
the City of BisBee case aga'ns- the
Bisbee Improvement company, decid
ing that the franchise in question was
a valid one. In 1906 the International
das company secured a franchise from
the city for gas and light purposes.
In January. 1908, the gas company
sold its business with the franchise
to the Bisbee Light and Power com
pany. In June, 1911, the company
went into the hands of a receiver and
the nronertv sold to W. J. AinsW.irth.
who in turn transferred it to the Ris-!
bee Improvement company. Soon I
afterward the city council attracted
the right of the transfer of the fran
chise t'j the B. I. company and it wa3
taken into court where it has been
pending since July. 1911. The deri
sion as rendered sustains the decision
of Judge Lockwood of the lower
court. While the derision h)ld8 that
the franchise obtained by the pur
chase by the B. I. company is a valid
one, the decision does not amount to
much to the company, as it is a pub

NEW YORK. May 13. Carl Lim
berg, an automobile racer and R. Pal
lotti, his mechanician, leading the field
in t.'ie fifteenth lap of the 150 mile
race for the Metropolitan Trophy,
were killed when their machine crash
ed into a guard rail on the sheeps
head Bay track this afternoon.
Limberg who had been taking the
turns near the top of the track, ap
parently lost control of his car while
rounding the bend at a speed of more
than 100 miles an hour. Bot'i men
were catapulted lf)0 feet over the rail
and crashed to the ground about 30
feet below. The driver was impaled
on an upright piece of timber and was
killed instantly. Pallotti died on the
wav to the Coney Island Hospital.
The Machine, one of three French
cars imported for the race by Harry
S. Harkness. crumpled under the
impact and burst into flames. The
blazing car clung to the rail of their
fellow racer. A flash of flame and a
cloud of black smoke told the specta
tors t.'iat an accodient had happened
but as it occurred at the far turn of
the two mile saucer, few realized that
it marked a tragedy.
Kddie Rickenbacher was an easy
winner of the trophy in 1 hour and 33
minutes and 31 seconds, an average of
96.23 miles an hours for the 150 miles.
Jules Devigne finished second in 1
hour 35 minutes and 11 seconds, and
Ira Vail third in 1 hour 38 minutes and
44.68 seconds.

in the race and Joseph Christiansens

Limberg was a long distance runner
and a bicycle and motorcycle racer
before automobile racing became pop
ular. He came to New York from
San Jose. California, eight years ago
as an amateur bicycle racer and later
became a professional.
