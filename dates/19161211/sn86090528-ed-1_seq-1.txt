Abercrombie Writes From Los Angeles;
Hopes Proposed Bond Issue in
Grady will Carry
After spinning over California's fa
mous highways, J, R. Abercrombie of
this city is more enthusiastic than
ever over hard-surface roads. From
Los Angeles, under date of December
6, Mr. Abercrombie writes to the Ex
press as follows:
"I note in your paper of the 28th
your write-up in regard to good roads
j meeting.
"I wish to say while I have only
been out l.ere a short time that every
one is tai'king of tne goud hard rouds
that have been built in this state hi
tho past thre? years.
"California lias spent seventy mil
lion dollars on hard roads and has ap
propriated fifteen million more this
year to build laterals to many north
a:ul south roads which, when complet
ed tiie coming year, will be 950 miles
long.
"They tell me that all farm land in
from five to ten miles on each side of
this main hard road has advanced
from $20 to $30 per acre since the
road has been built.
"There should not be any farmer
vole against these bonds if the road
goes anywhere near his farm and
there should not be anyone in business
oppose them if they want the country
to advance and make more business
for them.
"Last Saturday Mr. .rutititils, whom
nvtiiy Chickasha people remember,
wanted to take ma out for a little
drfve, so he said he guessed we'd bet
ter run down to San Diego, which is 136
miles, but all paved except about 12
miles, which they are now working on.
We had five or six small towns to go
through where lie had to slow down
to 12 or 15 miles per hour and quite
a number of hills and canyons to go
through ' but still we made an aver
age speed of 38 miles per hour on the
trip. That shows that there can be
enough saved in time to pay for the
roads if nothing else. More than one
half the freight between the towns
that are on the hard roads is hauled
by motor trucks at about one-third to
one-half the railroad charges.
"Hoping they will get the petition
signed so as to bring same to a vote
and that It will carry, I remain,
"Yours truly,
"J. R. Abercrombie."
