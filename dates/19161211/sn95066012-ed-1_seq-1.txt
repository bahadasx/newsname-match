Lloyd-George Given More Power
Than His Predecessors
WAR CABINET IS ANNOUNCED
Composed of New Prime Minister,
Lord Mllner, Earl. Curson, Andrew
Bonar Law and Arthur Henderson
London, Dec. 10. The official list
of the new ministry Issued tonight fol
lows the unofficial forecasts with two
or three minor changes. Mr. Lloyd
George. Lord Milner, Earl Curzou, An
drew Bonar Law and Arthur Hender
son form what Is officially termed the
war cabinet while the others, who or
dinarily, are called heads of depart
ments. An Important point in this novel or
ganization Is that it concentrates far
more power in the hands of the prime
minister than the Britlch system ever
has known before. Mr. Lloyd-Georges
proposals to Premier Aaqulth were for
a war council, of which the premier
should not be a member, although he
should have the power of passing on
its work. Mr. Lloyd-George has not
hesitated to place himself in a posi
tion more closely resembling a dicta
torship than he was willing to give
his predecessor.
The war cabinet will have dally ses
sions, directing the prosecution of the
war, and the freedom of Mr. Lloyd
George, Lord Milner and Mr. Hender
son from departmental duties will al
low them to devote all their time to
the war council.

Petrograd Claims Check of Austro

BULGARIANS AGAIN OVER DANUBE
Germans Have Taken 112,000 Ruman

Losses Small.
Petrograd, Dec. 10. The Ruman
ians who have been retreating in
Eastern Wallachia. before the Teu
tonic advance have made a stand to
the east of Ploechti, the War Office
announced today. They assumed the
offensive on the road from Ploechti
to Buzen and drove the Austro-Ger-man
forces back to the westward. On
the Moldavian frontier the Russian
advance is continuing in the river val
leys, despite strong resistance.
Berlin, Dec. 10, (by Wireless to
Sayville.) A new crossing of the Dan
ube, between Cernavoda and Sllistrio,
by the Bulgarians, Is announced In to
day's army headquarters statement re
garding operations on the Rumanian
front, which also records a continued
advance by the Teutonic armies in
Eastern Wallachia.
The Rumanians have lost approxi
mately 112,000 men in prisoners since
Rumania entered the war, or about
one-sixth of their array, besides suf
fering casualties estimated at about
300,000, writes the military critic of
the Overseas News Agency today in
his review of tho Rumauian campaign.
Not only has this loss to the Ru
manians resulted from the campaign
but the Teutonic victory has made pos
sible the shortening or the front by
about 550 kilometers, or more than 340
miles.
The German' losses are declared to
have been astonishingly small. One
army corps, which made 8,000 prison
ers and, besides, 1s calculated to have
been accountable ranks, had itself con
siderably less than 1.000 casualtes,
writes the military critic, who also in
stances the capture by the Teutonic
forces during the past week of nearly
30,0,00 men In prisoners, besides Im
mense quantities of cannon, machine
gun mateTial and supplios.
The great Russian offsensive on the
north pressed in force and at the cost
of great sacrifices in an effort to save
portions of the Northern Rumanian
army, is declared to have been alto
gether in vain.

"My Dear Field Marshal:
"The Rumanian campaign, which
with God's assistance, already has led
to such brilliant successes, will be
valued in tho war history of all times
as a bright example of the strategic
art of genius. You have again con

carrying them out, and you proposed
to me with far-seeing thoughtfulness
measures which directed the way to
separately marching columns for a
united blow.
"To you and your well-tried assist

the Fatherland again are due. With

The Rumanian Shock.
Tho capture by the Teutonic armies
of Bucharest, capital of the kingdom
of Rumania, as these lines are writ
ten, seems a question of hours only.
Von Falltenhayn from the west and
Von Meckensen from the south have
converged upon the city and desplto
strong resistance have forced their
way to the gates. In their advance
from the borders of the kingdom the
invaders have overrun a considerable
portion of its territories, have inflict
ed serious defeats upon the Rumani
ans and their allies, the Russians, and
have driven the defending forces in a
shattered condition to the Bhelter of
the Bucharest forts. The experience
of the present war teaches that these
will prove inadequate to withstand the
assailants more than a brief time. So
keen is the threat that the capital of
the kingdom has been removed to a
distant city.
The conquest of Rumania, insofar
as it has progressed, is, everything
considered, the most striking example
of Teutonic military prowess that the
present war has witnessed. The
striking feature about It is the
"punch" it discloses at a stage when
something quite opposite had bern
anticipated. It must be quite as dis
concerting to the Entente as It is sur
prising to the world at largo. Espec
ially must it come as a shock to Ru
mania. Randolph Herald and News.

SPELLING TEST
Results of Test In Simple Words Giv
en in Grades and High School.
Tho following simple test in spell
ing was glvem last week in grades
four to eight in the graded school and
aluo in the high school:
I am not afraid to slide down hill.
Don't throw the ball any farther.
A company of eight men will remain
on duty.
My personal friend is in the navy.
The Judge will refuse to send him to
Jail.
I intend to figure the cost.
We had perfect weather during the
whole of August.
The fourth of September came on
Thursday.
The use of capital letters counted
as part of tho spelling test. In high
school 12 students in tho teachers
training course took the test. Eleven
of them missed no words and one
missed the word weather. Other re
sults were as follows:
5 special students, 2 words.
67 first year, 58 words.
58 second year, 31 words.
30 third year, 10 words.
27 fourth year, 4 words.
Students were required to write
name and class at the top of their
papers. 19 socond year pupils mis
spelled sophomore Weather was
misspelled 15 times; Judge, 13; slide.
10 and throw 10. In the grades above
the fifth results "were satisfactory, but
in the fourth and fifth grades there is
room for improvement. In the fourth
grade several words were not in the
pupils' vocabulary but in both grades
many simple words were misspelled.
The total number In grades and high
school taking the test was 614. Fourth '
was missed 154 tlmos; weather, 93,
throw 107, dudge 100, slide 65, don't
80, Thursday) 107. A large part of
these mistakes were in the fourth and
fifth grades. These same words in
the seventh grade were misspelled
10, 2, 7, 4, 1, 2, and 8 times respective
iy.
The record of per cent correctly
spoiled is as follows: Grade four. 78;
five, 90; six, 94; seven, 97; eight, 97;
high school, 99. For the whole 614
studrnts writing a total of 37, 882
words and misspelling 2.795 the per
cent correct was 92.6. In high school
129 missed no word and in the grades
77.
This is but the beginning of a scien
tific Investigation into spelling condi-'
Hons in the local schools. The aim '
of the work is to enable pupils to

righted poem:
Here where the meadow grasses
fringed the street
And shadows fell from the green

He crooned above bis types, hearing

Voices of future fame by day and

And here one eve the footworn

Bearing the dark load of a race's
wrong,
His lonely eyes lit up with freedom's
flamo,
His stammering lips mighty with free

Forth from this place the summoned

Snow-white in armor, and the sword

Which from its aim was never to bo

Till slavery died upon a blood-soaked

Evi Effects of liquor Vividly Paint
ed By Billy Sunday
WORSE THAN WAR IN EUROFE
Evangelist is For Woman Suffrage
Because the Women Are Fighting
the Saloon.
Poston, Dec. 10. Billy Sunday
started his activo campaign against
the liquor interests of Boston today
when at three big meetings more than
34,000 persons, bya rising vote,
promised to do all in their power to
swing the city into the dry column at
the election, which Is less than two
weeks away. "Uoozo, or get on the
water wagon," was the subject of the
evangelist's sermon at bothe the after
noon and evening services. With all
the power at his command the athletic
painted the evil effects of liquor. All
arguments against no-llcense he dealt
with in a masterful way.
It was a big day for "trail-hitters."
with 2811 people registering their in
tention to follow the teachings of the
Bible. Long before the scheduled
hour for the evening service the Im
mense tabernacle was thronged with
a mass of humanity. Every seat in
the building wus occupied at 6.30 fully
an hour before the evangelist arrived.
From then on until 7.30 more than
20,000 were turned away.
The baseball preachers worked at
his best this evening, putting all the
action that has made him famous in
his talk. At the end of the sermon,
with collar wilted, breathless and
exhausted, he totttTed to the ante
room. Mr. Sunday in part said:
I will take my text from the eighth
chapter of Matthew, the 28th and S2d
verse, describing' the casting out of
tho devils which entered into the
swine.
I want to say right at the begin
ning that the saloon hasn't got a leg
to stand on. Tho time ha3 long gone
by when uuybody can offer the slight
est excuse or apology for the awful
eiTects of rum on men, women and
children. Not a single argument can
be advanced in favor of rum. The
rum traffic is the devil's own, and the
sooner It is wiped out the hotter off
the people of this nation will be.
Go from one end of this land to tho
other and you will find ckan homes
and happy ones where the sale of
liquor is prohibited. Go Into those
towns where boose is sold and you
will find pauperism and insanity and
rottenness of life and politics and filth
and everything that is dirty and
mean and vile.
Let me tell you that the horrors
that has piled up across the Atlantic
since the war started are nothing to
tho horrors that have been piled up
by boozo in this country.
Say, If you women want to do some
thing for tho glory of God and of hu
manity, fight the liquor traffic. Don't
let the Woman's Christian temperance
union do it all. That's one reason
that I'm lor equal suffrage. Its op
ponents are all saloon men.
Tho man who fails to vote against
liquor is just as responsible for the
drunkard as is tho saloonkeeper.
There are a lot of church members
who didn't vote against liquor. Well,
hell will bo so full of church members
that they'll be sticking their feet out
of the windows.
That is the attitude of the liquor
traffic toward the church and state
and government and the preacher that
has the backbone to fight tho most
damnable, corrupt institution that
ever wriggled out of hell and fastened
itself on the ppblic.
There is Just one prime reason why
the saloon has not been knocked into
hell, and that is the false statement
"That the saloons are needed to help
lighten the taxes." The saloon busi
ness has never paid, and it has cost
50 times more for tho saloon than the
revenue derived from it.
I challenge you to show me where
the saloon has ever helped business,
education, church, morals or anything
we hold dear.
Listen! Seventy-five per cent of
our idiots como from intemperate par
ents; 80 per cent of the paupers; 82
per cent of the crime is committed by
men under the Influence of liquor; 90
per cent of the adult criminals are
whisky made. Tho Chicago Tribune
kept track for 10 years and found that
53,556 murders were committed by
men under the influence of liquor.
Archbishop Ireland, tho famous Ro
man Catholic of St Paul, said of
social crime today: "The 75 per cent
is caused by drink and 80 per cent of
tho poverty." 1 go to a family and it
is broken up, and I say, "What caused
this?" Drink! I stop up to a young
(man on the scaffold and say, "What
brought you here?" Drink! Whence
all tho misery, and sorrow, and cor
ruption? Invariably it is drink.

Albany, Dec. 11. Mayor George R.
Lunn of Schenectady last night upset
an arrangement whereby one moving
picture exhibitor was to have been ar

was made, the major directed that the

At police headquarters it was said
plain clothes men, at that hour, had
visited all of the theatres and would
furnish information upon which war

rest of other exhibitors, in tho event
that Zelser was convicted of violat
ing tho Sunday laws. It was under
stood according to tho police and ex
hibitors that only one moving picture
proprietor would be arrested.
At 9.15 o'clock Dr. Lunn inquired of
the police what was being done to en
force the decision of the appellate
division of supreme court, third de
irtinent, in holding that Sunday mov
ing puicture shows were in violation
of the Sunday observance laws. When
told that one exhibitor had been ar
