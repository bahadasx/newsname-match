MY BETTERMARKETS
By Eliminating Waste, Agri
cultural Experts Hope to
Reduce Living Costs.
Ry United Press ,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. The Unit
ed States must affect a change In its
marketing it it would Jiave relief from
the high prices, experts of the De
partment of Agriculture asserted to
day. While the Department of Justice
conUnues to develop food price inves
tigations, the Department of Agricul
ture is working on methods of Im
proving the market condiUons.
Taking a leaf from Europe experts
of the Department of Agriculture hope
to present comprehensive plans where
by every city can Improve Its pres
ent methods. They seek to eliminate
much of the waste, to chop out some
of the middle-man's profits and by
proper organization to save pennies
now being lost.
The Department of JusUce experts
want a new law to deal with food
prices, complaining that they find the
present law not entirely adequate for
their purpose. Hence they expect to
ask Congress to pass a more flexible
and usable measure. Federal District
Attorney Anderson expected to confer
with President Wilson, preliminary to
starting for Cleveland, Chicago and
Detroit, where he will take a promt
nent part in the federal investigations
already under way.
Egg, butter and poultry prices fell
again in Columbia today, while oleo
margerine prices are rising.
Eggs are selling in Columbia for
30 cents a dozen, 10 cents lower than
Friday's quotation. The produce deal
ers are paying 25 cents to the pro
ducers, but thegrocery stores pay 30
cents. The fall in price does not
mean that the hen strike has been
called off, for there has not been
any increase in production. One of
the dealers said that the, placing of
more cold storage eggs on the mar
ket caused the drop.'
Poultry prices are about 4 cents a
pound lower than last week. Eggs
are so high and chickens so cheap
that not much poultry is being sold.
Many producers are -probaWy plan
ning to profit by the high price of
eggs as soon as their hens start lay
ing.
Country butter is retailing at 35
cents a pound; the producer receives
30 cents. The decrease in the pro
duction of butter was accompanied by
a marked increase in the sale of
oleomargerine. Thd Increased de
mand brought higher prices. In the
last ten days the prices have advanc
ed twice and it Is now selling at 30
cents a pound and $1.15 in five-pound
packages for the uncolored variety.

Liberalism Gets Upper Hand

APPROVAL IS WIDE
Country Is Looking Forward
Now, United Press Cor
respondent Writes.
By ED L. KEEN
United Press Special Correspondent.
LONDON, Dec. 11. The energizing
forces of Lloyd-Georges magic toucn
in five days have electrified the Brit
'ish' nation. While the new 'war di
rector has been forced to bed with a
chill, brought on by a fortnight of
hard work, London is today In a fever
of enthusiasm.
That the most cursed and respect
ed figure in the last half century of
British politics is to have the full
force of the British nation behind
him in whatever he does, not only
in the presence of the nation but in
the face of every man, wftman and
street urchin, -Is now evident. The
ND
seemingly impossible has been accomf01? InfonnatJn nt Swiss
plished. The hard shell of British
conservatism has been cracked. Ven
eration and precedent have been
thrust aside, and the thing which "is
done" has come into the nation's at
tention. For the first time since August,
1914, John Bull is looking forward,
not stumbling along with his glance
backward over his shoulder. While
the German press is referring with
contempt to the new British "dicta
tor," Englishmen, even strong Con
servatives, are jusUfying the new1 de
velopments of "Democracy's .greatest
triumph of the century." Moreojer, it
Is apparent that Lloyd-George is no
man's man but his own.
Charges of newspapers antagonis
tic to the Welchman that he was the
mere tool of Lord Northcliffe have
been victoriously disputed by Lloyd'
George's choice of two men In his
ministry who have been bitterly at
tacked by Northcliffe's newspaper.
They are Arthur J. Balfour and Lord
Robert Cecil.

That a man is just as duty bound
to pay for "M. V. Bourbon Whisky,'
as he ia for shoes, clothing or food
was the opinion of a Jury, in the suit
of The Herzog Co. of Toledo, Ohio,
against S. D. Crews, a former Colum
bian, held ta the justice court of D,
W. B. Knrtx Saturday afternoon.
It was claimed that in 1913 The Her
zog Company had a man In Columbia
soliciting orders for liquor. The de
fendant, S. Df Crews, who was then
proprietor of the livery stable at
Seventh and Walnut but who is now a
farmer living near" Hallsville, placed
but claims JLhat he never received the
order. On December 12 of the same
year he again ordered the same
amount of the same kind of whisky
and he claims that the order arrived
but when he opened the box there
were four bottles missing. He payed
for neither order.
W. H. Sapp, attorney for the de
fense, defended his client on the
grounds that the liquor was sold in
violation of the law. E. C. Anderson,
.for the plaintiff, was unable to find
any record of the flrst shipment either
at Toledo or Columbia. -Ituwas de
cided that the. defendant would have
to pay for the last order, which
amounted to $18.

NUMBER 86
M.U.'s Summer Session Plans
Adopted by the Seven
Valley Institutions.
TO HAVE FOUR TERMS
Would Mean No Material
Change at Missouri, Says
President Hill.
An all-year session for the seven
institutions of higher learning in the
Missouri Valley Conference was In
dorsed by an unanimous vote of the
delegates of the conference at their
ijfth annual meeting in Kansas City
last Saturday. They expect to sub
mit the plan to the governing boards
of the universities of the conference.
The eleven months' school year is
nothing more than the Missouri sys
tem of the winter and summer ses
sions, according to President A. Rosa
Hill, who returned yesterday from
the Conference.
.The University of Missouri has had"
this summer session for several years'
and is a pioneer in "the work in the,
Valley, The only change which is be
ing suggested for the adoption of the
plan by the Valley Conference is the
division of the school year into quar
ters making the summer session the
fourth quarter of the year.
The summer session of the Univer
sity may be extended to include sev
eral of the schools not included in the
work at the present time.
The University of Kansas, Univer
sity of Nebraska, Drake University,
Washington University, Iowa State (.
College, Kansas State Agricultural'
College and the University of Mis
souri are the schools which may adopt
the new school year plan.
In an interview in Sunday's Kansas
City Star. H. J. Waters, president of
Kansas State Agricultural College,
gave afew jofihe xeasonsfor adopt
ing the new plan. "CoUegesv. and
universities 'in the United. States to
day represent an investment of half
a billion dollars," he said. "A third

of a million students attend these in
stitutions. Under the present system
the schools are closed sixteen weeks '
in the year, making an enormous loss
to both students and institutions."
"The beflef that it isharder for
students to study in summer, than in
other seasons is unfounded. Experi
ments have proved conclusively that
the period of highest mental activity
Is in the spring and fall. The low
est is in winter. If colleges .adopt
the all-year session, it will Immediate
ly be accepted by high schools and
grammar schools."
The conference elected H. M. Bell,
president of Drake University, , as
president to succeed Doctor Waters.'
El W. Stanton, vice-president of Iowa
State College, was re-elected secre
