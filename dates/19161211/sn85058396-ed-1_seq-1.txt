I in Galicia.
jj jf;j Indications today point more strong
ly jlii y than ever to the probability that
t lit the new defensive lino of the Ruman
;j f ians, following their retreat from
i lit Bucharest, will be drawn along the
' Buzeu river, forming the southern
J .u boundary of their northern province
g of Moldavia.
I : Additional reports from Petrograd
f indicate a considerable measure of
I success by the Rumanian northern
i x .army in holding up the Teutonic ad
4 J vance northeast along the railroad
i from Ploechti, north of Bucharest to
j the town of Buzeu, located at about
i ( the center of the Buzeu river line,
J v which stretches eastward to the low-
I :J er reaches of the Danube.
) It is necessary to the apparent pur-
pose of the Rumanians for them to
u prevent an Austro-German advance
i here until the Rumanian forces fur
! Iher south in eastern Wallachia, re
I treating from the region between
j 5 Bucharest and Tchemavoda, have
J ' reached the Buzeu river line, unless,
J indeed, the Rumanian military author
it i ities have decided to retain a hold on
more of eastern Wallachia than it now
j seems their purpose to defend. These
II I Rumanian forces are threatened not
j only by Fiold Marshal von Macken
I j sen's Danube army but by contingents
li ! of Bulgarians which have crossed the
lli j Danube between Silistrla and Tcher
I navoda.
! Russians Hammering Teutons.
I Meanwhile the Russians are ham-
I i mering away at the Austro-German
I lines on the western frontier of Mol-
I j davia and report making headway in
HI , the valleys running toward the west.
HI ! Their object apparently is not only
to hold the Moldavian frontier safe,
but possibly to achieve an eventual
II success In breaking well through into
II t Hungary and cutting in behind the
l Austro-German supply lines leading
i into Rumania from the north.
' There has been little fighting of an
important nature on the other fronts,
i In Macedonia, the Serbians report
if having driven the Bulgarians back in
one" sector northeast of Monastir.
On the Franco-Belgian front little
( has developed beyond intermittent ar-
! tillery activity in the Somme area and

( scale.
i David Lloyd-George, the now British
j premier, is ill, suffering from a severe
s chill and has postponed his speech in

supreme court action was expected
today on the motion to assign for
early hearing the case testing the va

SMITH GIVEN PARDON S
German Consular Officials Al
leged to Have Ordered Dyna- -H
mite Explosions in
Canada.
San Francisco, Dec. 11. Letters,
original copies of telegrams and varl
ous documents alleged to have been
written by some of the defendants
in the trial of Franz Bopp, German
consul-general here, and six others
charged with having violated the neu- 'H
trality of the United States by con
spiring to set on foot an expedition in
this country and Canada to destroy -H
commerce and munitions of the en
tente allies, were to be presented as
evidence by tho government today at
the opening of the second weak of the 'H
trial. Federal prosecutors, who aro
assisting United States District Al
torney Preston in handling the case,
said they hoped by the admission of
the communications to prove that or-
ders for the destruction of bridges and Jl
tunnels in Canada and the explosion 'M
of a dynamite barge in Seattle harbor
last year came direct from German
consular officials here.
Louis J. Smith, a defendant in the 'M
case who is said to have revealed H
details of the conspiracy to govern- '
mont officials, -and C. C. Crowley, a
i detective, are th& two men the govern.
ment alleges attempted to carry out
the conspiracy of hampering traffic in H
allied munitions. Smith has .since .
become the government's chief wit
ness. When the government placed
him on the stand last Thursday the ll
defense unexpectedly protested on the il
ground that Smith was a felon, con- '1
victcd by court martial for offenses Jl
committed in the army and that he I
served a term in Leavenworth prison. ?
The admissibility of Smith's testl- '
mony was to be decided today by :
Judge William N. Hunt In the mean-
time papers restoring Smith to cltl- ,
zenship have been forwarded from H
Washington. The restoration papers, ,
it was said, will in effect operate as ;
a presidential pardon and qualify
Smith as a witness. 1

mined definitelv the government will I
