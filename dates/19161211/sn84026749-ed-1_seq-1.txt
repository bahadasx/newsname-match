In the 'legislative, executive, and Ju

The Increase doee not become ef

The legislative provision Included
ta the bill reads:
"Sec. e. That to provide, during the
tseal year nineteen hundred and
eighteen, for Increased compensation
at the rate of ten per centum per
annum to employes who receive sal
arles at a rate per annum less than
.$1,200, and for Increased compensa
tion at the rate of five per centum
per annum to employes who receive
salaries at a rate not more than ft.SOO
per annum and not less than $1,200
per annum, so much aa may be neces

"Provided, That this section, shall
nnly apply to the employes of the Li
terary of Congress, the Botanic Oar
den, and the executive and Judicial
Jatabllahments, who are appropriated
or In thla act specifically and under
lump sums or whose employment Is
authorised herein. .......
"Provided further. That detailed re
ports shall be submitted to Congress
on the first day of the next session
allowing the number "of persons, the
grades or character of positions, the
rlglnel rates of compensation, and
tee Increased rates of compensation

The percentage Increase floea not

aad lions are unaffected.
Congressman Howard, of aeorgta. at
tempted to ret through an amendment
(creasing She salaries of members
Secretarlea from ILM0 to 11.800. Th s
amendment failed In committee on a tie
vote.
The committee Is understood to have
been practically unanimous for the per
centage Increase for employes In the
executive departments.
The examples set In the bill reported
today Is likely to be followed In other
appropriation bills covering the Depart
ment of Agriculture, the District of
Columbia. The Interstate. Commerce
Commission and various other bureaus
aad commissions not appropriated for
in the legislative, executive and Judicial
budget.
Framed by Babeensaslttee.
The language contained In the
legislative bill was submitted by the
subcommittee which framed It, head
ad by Congressman Byrns of Ten
aasaee. ' The full Appropriations
Committee adopted It after considera
ble discussion.
One of the objections likely to be
raised against a blanket aalary in
crease on a percentage basis Is that
it penallsea the lower paid employes.
For Instanos, a clerk or messenger
receiving U40 a year would get a $54
Increase, while a clerk receiving $1,150
a year would get a $115 Increase.
Thus the first clerk not only gets a
mailer salary, but the smaller In
erease. Oaly For One Year.
It will also be noted that the leg
islative rider provides for Increased
salaries for the ons fiscal year, 181.
and there Is nothing in the rider to
Indicate a statutory change of the
existing salary scale.
The language Is generally con
strued to mean that a year hence, In
the next bill. Congress can either go
baok to the old salaries, re-enact the
language of this rider or modify it.
Borland Attempt Falls.
Congressman Borland, a member of
the committee, made an unsuccessful
attempt to Include once more In the
bill his pet rider requiring the Gov
ernment clerks to work an additional
half hour a day. .,..
This amendment was Included by
the "committee last year, but over
whulmfnirlv defeated In the House.

CHRISTMAS FUNDS
TO EXCEED $600,000

Savings Systems of Washing-
ten Provide More Than Half
Million to Spend.
More than half a million dollars
will be mailed to holiday aavera In
Washington by banka who have con
ducted Christmas savlnga clubs this
year.
This announcement waa made to
day by cashiers of half a doiin Insti
tutions aa accounts In the saving sys
tem were closed for this season.
This week and next will see this
amount spent In the city's clothing
and gift storss. About 00 per cent of
the savers, according to estlmatea ob
tained by bankers and merchants,
spend all oi the money saved during
the year for Christmas purposes.
Security Savings and Commercial
Bank officials predicted today the
amount of Christmas savings would
be upward of $000,000.
I Will Have Meaey.
Thla means that, on a per capita
basis, 30,000 cltlsens who were frugal
during the past fifty weeks, wiy have
money to spend for Christmas things.
A conservative estimate placed the
per capita amount for depositors at
$30.
"Many people who will receive
checka this week would have no
money to spend for Christmas If they
had not Joined one of these savings
rlubs," a prominent banker said To
day. Approxtmatsly half a million dol
lars was spent by Christmas ahoppers
last year In the week corresponding
to this as a result of these aavlnrs ac
counts, according to returned checks.
About 10 per cent of those who in
vested In thisOctnd of deposits will re
turn the checks to be added to their
savings accounts, It Is estimated. '
Certificates ( Deaxtatt.
The checks from the Security Sav
ings and Commercial Bank are In the
form of curtiflcates of deposit which
may be left In the bank and draw an
Increased rate of Interest In the event
the sum Is not .withdrawn within
sixty days. If the certificates are
left on aepom ror six months or
longer, they win draw 4 per cent
Interest.
The plan of te cluba is largely
uniform, deposits of from 60 cents to
$2 per week constituting the savings.
New cluba will be started next week
and anDeals are belnirNaent nut hv
many Institutions for a greater num
ber of depositors for Christmas next
year.

to
Poultry, eggs, and butter direct
from producers In Virginia, Maryland,

means of brlngfng down the high
cost of living, is the plan Postmaster
Merrltt O. Chance Is making effective
today.
Through postmasters at. pplnta
within the first and second parcel
post sones surrounding Washington,
where the first sone rate applies to
parcels, the postmaster has procured
the names and addresses of 1,400
farmers who have eggs, butter, and

All net List.
This list Is being printed In cir
cular form today, and aa aoon aa fin
ished the circulars will be' mailed to
every family In Washington, who
then can get In direct touch with the
farmer and source of supply, eliminat
ing entirely the middleman and hla
profits.
The recent high levels at which
firoduce has been selling haa resulted
n considerable Increase In' the use of
the parcel post. It 'Is stated.
Postmaster Chance believes, how
ever, that there are hundreds of fam
ilies In Washington who, either be
cause of Ignorance aa to the methods
or drallna- In thla manner, or becaUe
of lack of Information aa to where to
place orders, are not making use of
the parcels post system.

Postmsster Chance expecta that by
thus placing the namea of the pro
ducers before Washington families the
use of tho parcels post as a means of
marketing foodstuffs will be greatly
Increased, and that a material aavlng
will be effected in cost.
"Our action In sending out this list
to Washington families la In line with
the plan of First Assistant Postmaa
ter General J. C. Koons for rcduc ng
the high cost of living by bringing
the producers and consumers together
through the parcel post," said Post
master Chance today. ,The Parcel
post haa been becoming constantly
more popular, and I believe that
through the effort of the department
the living cost will be materially re
duced." nivea Full laferasatlea.
The circular Issued by Postmaster
Chance gives, In addition to the
names and addresses of farmers with
produce for sale, parcel post rates on
produce, the names and addresses of
business houses having for sale prop
er receptacles for use In shipping
butter, eggs and other supplies.
"Nearly all the postofflres mention

There are several other larger Items

The six that are atated were the
principal ones taken up today, and
they led to aeveral sharp exchanges
between the members nf the commis
sion and the witness and the commis
sion's" counsel and the witness.
Witness Almert objected tn what he
seliLwere Corporation Syme's habit of
asking "catch ' questions.
Commissioner Brownlow took occa
sion to tell the witness that It was
not for htm tn try to determine what
Mr. Syme might happen to be think
ing about any of the questions asked,
but that he was supposed to answer
Mr. Syme's questions.
On another occasion Commissioner
Newman Insisted that the wltnesa had
not answered a question that had
been asked' him.
Itebukrs Wltnras.
These passages were followed by a
statement from Commissioner Kuta
that the object of the commission Is to
secure some data on Which a fair
valuation of the company's property
can be reached, and that It Is the
business of the witness to answer the
questions put to him aa they are put,
and not to seek to place hla own
construction on what Is passing In
the mind of the counsel wbsn he asks
the questions.
The fact that the flgurea In the com-
fany'a valuation shsrts are based on
he quotations for July 1, 1010, and
not on July 1. 1014, as Is the case with
the estlmatea of the commission's ex
perts, waa brought out with consider
able emphasis at the beginning of to.
day'a hearing, through a series of
questions which Commissioner Kuta
put to Engineer Almert.
Absolute' Comparisons.
Commissioner' Kuta stated that the
commission desired to be set exactly
right on thla question because It wish,
ed to Institute absolute comparisons
with the figures of the company and
those prepared by Engineer Plllsbury
for the commission. The Commie
sloner asked specifically with regard
to the prices for labor, concrete, cop
per. and poles.
The anawers that were given by
Engineer Almert were principally to
the effect that the, 1010 prlcea had
been used as the basis.
It was developed that the manner
In which the company had conducted
Its valuation was to obtain the Mill
prlcea for varloua Items and then
deduct from the total amount spent
for them during the history of the
concern, the amount spent during tlm
two years 1010 and lOlll. giving the
remainder aa the proper charge In
valuation figures as of July 1. 1011.

htlon is supposed to have been made,
aeOO,000 Marat la Time.
Prevloua testimony has Indicated
that the total additions to the plant
of the company since 1914, that Is.
tho total amount. of money speu,t on
additions, etc.. has been about 600.
000. which Is about 10 per cent of the
total valuation as fixed by the coni
mission's experts, and less than half
of that of tho total valuation flxeil
by 'the company's experts.
It was for this reason that at the
opening of the hearing Commissioner
Kuta .desired to have placed In the
Ilecord the exact manner the witness
had arrived at his computations.
It was developed by the Commis
sioner's questions that In the case of
some of the items the company had
the prices for 1914 and 1915. but had
not Included them In the report. He
asked that these prices be given.
Hauaht Definite Daala.
Expert Almert explained that he
had thought It best to compute on
a definite basis because the reproduc
tion of the plant was for 1010, aa he
had found it. It was. however, he
esld, based on prices for all these
years. -
He said that some p tho prices
used In the computation was less than
It was in 1014. He cited turbines as
one, of these prices. Ho said that tho
labor, poles, etc., were aomo, of tlm
things on which thero might be dif
ferences, hut that ho could not answer
as to other Items. Ho said, how
ever, the company had the flgiue,
and that they would bo furnished to
the commission.
