NW YORK, Dec. 11. George W.
Perkins, former partner in J. P. Mor
gan & Co., and financial sponsor of
the progressive party, has begun an
Investigation today of the high cost of
living as chairman of a committee of
five appointed by Governor Whitman
to recommend remedial legislation.
Mr. Perkins says he blames the high
price of foodstuffs in this city on
market conditions. He asserts that
California is far ahead of New York
state in the matter of distribution,
and cites Cleveland as an example of
a city which recently has adopted
modern methods. Mr. Perkins is also
chairman of Mayor Mitchel's commit
tee to Investigate the price of food
stuffs. EPITHETS WRITTEN
OH SCHOOL STEPS
Discontent of High School Students
Voiced In Unruly Action
Last Night.
Lute last night or early this morn
ing, some unknown persons wrote in
large letters over th? steps, leading
up to the front doors of the high
rchool, epithets pertaining to Super
intendent Park and Principal Drill.
No trace was left by the persons and
no one has as yet been suspected.
Principal Drill, Superintendent
Park and professor Chloupek were
in the building last evening until
after dark and none of the work had
been done by that time. The paint
was secured from the manual train
ing room which was found open thl
morning.
It is thought that the act is the out
come of discontent among a numbef
of students, who believing the school
to be badly mismanaged and many
of their former liberties taken from
them, went to this extreme, hoping
to better conditions.
Several of the epithets as "Athletes
must get 99 in subjects," "Drill must
be removed, kids demand It." "To
Misery Drill's Kindergarten," and
others, show that the persons thought
themselves to be voicing the popular
sentiment of the students. These epi
thets were particularly directed
against Principal Drill who has prac
tically had charge of the high school
for the last few weeks.
The student body executive com
mittee met with Principal Drill late
thus morning and agreed to pay for
taking the paint from the steps. The
work is to be done this afternoon and
the last traces taken away by to
morrow morning.
The executive committee express
ed themselves as not being In favor
of the move taken by the persons and
favored taking action against it.

SECOND 1 ESCAPE CAUGHT
AFTER HE MS 10 HOI
OF HUGH BELL NEAR HELIX
Sheriff and Deputy Together
Through Snow all Night Finally Finding Fugitive Asleep at
Farm House of E. C. Snapp.
Burglary of the home of Hugh Bell
and the theft of a pair of heavy over
shoes led to the capture early this
morning of Harvey Bensen( one of
the four men who escaped from the
county jail Thursday afternoon. Sher.
iff Taylor and Deputy Estes, together
with ' Mr, Bell, tracked the man
through the snow during the night
and about 4 o'clock this morning
found him sleeping peacefully at the
farmhouse of E, C. Snapp a mile and
a half this side of Helix.
Bell, whose farm is near Helix, left
home with his family about 3 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, Bensene, who
had been hiding In an empty house on
the Dr. C. J. Smith place across the
road, saw him leave and at once en
tered the house. He took food, some
coins belonging to the children and
a pair of Mr. Bell's overshoes among
other things.
Returning home about 10 o'clock
last night, Mr. Bell discovered his loss
and at once called up Sheriff Taylor.
Though he toad been driving over the
country almost continuously since
Saturday night and had just returned
from a fruitless search, the sheriff to
gether with Deputy Estes, left in their
car and reached the Bell place about
midnight..
They picked up the man's tracks in
the snow and followed them easily

CONTRACTS MADE
FOR NEXT CROP
WHEAT AT $1.10
At a price reputed to be
(1.10 per bushel two small sales
of next crop wheat have been
made here. There Is a report In
circulation to the effect a price
of (1.25 per bushel was paid 4
on one deal but this price Is de-
nied by buyers who assert (1.10
has been the outside price of-
fered on next year's wheat.
On a basis of the Chicago
quotations for July wheat the
price of (1.10 for eastern Ore-
gon wheat is conservative. How-
ever it Is pointed out that our
wheat has no standing In the
Chicago pit because it has al-
ways been going to Liverpool
rather than the east. Conse-
quently It Is said to be impos- 4)
sible for brokers to make de-
livery of Inland empire wheat
on Chicago sales without suf-
fering a heavy dockage.

Snapp is only four miles from the Bell
place, he covered . several times that
distance in reaching It.
The officers arrived at the Snapp
house about 4 o'clock. Mr. Snapp
was already up. Bensene had applied
for a job from him the evening before
and had been given lodging. Mr.
Snapp was, however, suspicious and
had risen early In order to go to a
telephone to notify the sheriff. The
officers arrived before he had le.'t
the house and were taken to the bed
room where, Bensene was sleeping
soundly. He was brought back and
lodged in the jail again.
He states that he had been in the
empty house on the Smith place since
Saturday evening. His story of hit
wanderings from Thursday evening
until Saturday evening, however, Is to
contradictory that the officers took
no stock fn it
Steve Gunis, the first of the quartet
to be recaptured, was brought back
yesterday from La Grande by Deputy
Sheriff Estes. His story, too. Indi
cates that he is trying to conceal the
real facts, probably out of a desire
to protect Ed Vandiver and J. B.
Burns, the other two of the escapes
who are still at large.
The hoie In the wall of the Jail
through which the prisoners gained
their freedom was today filled up with
brick and concrete, but the returned
men are being kept in their cells..
