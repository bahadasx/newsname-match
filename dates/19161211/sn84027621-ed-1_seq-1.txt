Senator Duncan U. Fletcher of Flor

mercial Congress, opening the annual
session of that body here today, urg
ed the country to turn its attention
immediately to thes establishment of
closer business relations with neutral
nations. He declared the greatest op
portunity lay in Latin-America and
China. The federal farm loan act and
laws preventing rate discrimination,
blacklisting and dumping cheap for
eign products in the United States,
Senator Fletcher declared, would aid
the planters and manufacturers dur
ing the reconstruction period after the
European war. The shipping and
Webb bills before Congress would be
important factors, one providing the

Calculated by Rumanians to
Hold Teutons in Check
(Associated Press) ,
Washington, December 10. Unpre
cedented growth of the country's for
eign trade, the commercial advantages
which will accrue from peace and the
opportunity presented for a heavier
export business and greater invest
ments abroad are set forth today by
Secretary Redfield, of the depart
ment of commerce, in his annual re
port. "The report gives figures show
ing the nation's trade expansion of
two years and sums up the country's
commercial dominance as follows:
"Our foreign indebtedness has been
reduced possibly three billions. We
have loaned abroad a total sum since
the war began August 1, 1914, esti
mated at $1,500,000,000, and increas
ing. We are the wealthiest nation
in the world and the most prosperous
one. We have not wasted pur men or
means of war. Relatively to our fis
cal power today our debts are trifling.
Nations less wealthy than some of our
individual states bear a heavier burd
en of debt and interest than we.
"We are the only one of the great
industrial peoples at peace. Nations
turn to us for goods and means with
which to pay us for the goods. None
of us, in our wildest financial fancies
five years ago, would have dreamed
that things could be as now they are.
"To protect our reserve of gold,
which is the ultimate base on which
cur domestic credits rest, we must
maintain our export trade and must
continue to increase loans and invest
ments abroad. The work of the Bu
reau of Foreign and Domestic Com
merce is devoted to these important
duties. The report of the chief of
that service shows its extraordinary
growth and effectiveness . In thou
sands of business offices its aid is
acknowledged and welcomed. Never
has our government put at the dis
poal of our business and industry the
helpful facilities that are now pro
vided. V 7;' '

Indications today pointed more;
strongly than ever to the probability
of a new Rumanian defensive line
along the Buzeu river, which forms
the southern boundary of Moldavia.
Petrograd reports indicated the Ru
manian northern army held the Teu
tons along the railroad from Ploechti
to Buzeu. It seems necessary for the
Rumanians to hold here until the Ru
manians retreating from the region
between Bucharest and Tchernavoda
reach the Buzeu line. Meanwhile the
Russians continued the attacks on the
western Moldavian frontier and re
ported gains in the valleys running
westward. Apparently they hope to
eventually cut in behind the Teutonic
supply lines running into Rumania
from the north. In Macedonia the
Serbians reported driving the Bulgar
ians back northeast of Monastir. On
the Franco-Belgian front intermittent
artillery fighting and aviation opera
tions were reported.
GREECE MUST COME TO TAW
London, Dec. 11. The entente note
to Greece undoubtedly will be pre
sented tomorrow, the latest Athens
reports said. The entente may demand
complete demobilization of the Greek
army and the restoration of entente
control of posts, telegraph and rail
ways and the releave of imprisoned
Venizeloists.
INTERCEPTED THE MESSAGE
A wireless message from King Con
stantine addressed to Berlin has
been intercepted, said Greek advices.
REVOLUTION IN THE CYCLADES
London, Dec. 11. Athens telegram
today said a revolution had broken
out in the Cyclades, a group of islands
in the Aegean Sea.
A GAIN FOR RUMANIANS
Petrograd, Dec. 11. Rumanians
yesterday regained the positions east
of Ploechti from which they had been
driven by the Teutons, the war office
announced.
