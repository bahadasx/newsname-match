Northcliffe, who is the
nt the present political
with Lord
storm center
crisis. The
fall of the Asquith govoVnmcnt follows
on the continued hammering of the
Northcliffe press, and Iord North
cliffe is blamed or praised, according
to the point of view.
"The whole country has risen to the
leadership of Lloyd-George," said
T.nni Northcliffe. "The English spirit
rosnnnds t his will and determina
tion.
"He has summoned to his council
the best business brains of the coun
tryan element that has been entire
ly neglected by the politicians of tho
late government.
"The English are not an emotional
people, hut the crowds, which gath
ered in such numbers and with such
enthusiasm nt the war office today,
showed that the English people want
ed a man, and they have got a man.
"I think that Americans will wel
come the Lloyd-Oeorge ministry.
There are likely to be two men In the
now cabinet peculiarly' acceptable to
the United States, one of them in the
foreign office, which has to deal with
nil the questions arising vclveen the
two nations."
Confident of Success.
Lord Northcliffe was confident of
the present crisis working In such a
way as thoroughly to ncrgize the
conduct of the war. When asked
whether he would enter the govern
ment or tako any active personal part
in nolitics. Lord Nortlioiirte mm.
"To a newspaper like the New York
Times, which puts into practice
very large scale and with marked suc
cess the doctrine of promoting its own
welfare by working along thoroughly
Impersonal and independent lines for
the welfare of country and humanity,
tho course of the newspapers under
my management needs no explanation.
Throughout all these critical times, ho
called, tho Northcliffe press has
sought nothing for Its controlling
head, and for a reason that may be re
ferred to selfish motives, if only those
who examine the motives do so with i
an Informed mind.
'Newspapers can succeed only when
they are newspapers and nothing else,
that is to say, when they print the
news fully and fairly on one hand and

could such a paper ever appeal to thean, first lord of the treasury seems
public in a way broad enough to form !, Khow that the premier has no pres-
ii base on which to build a real news
paper success.
Arraigns Newspaper Critics.
"For proof of the fatuity of jour
nalistic endeavor in the form of a
Party organ a glimpse at the London
field is quite sufficient. In nearly ev
ery case the ubuse of the Northcliffe
Press comes from some pitiful failure
uf a newspaper that is a personal or po
litical affair and extra-journalistic in
Its aims. Such journalism is a fragile
mushroom and is bound to perish. To
the discriminating eye the criticism
Indulged in by such newspapers, is an
unwarranted tribute to power that
flops not exist or at least not in the

real preparedness In this war: We
Were up against the condition of the
German machine gun being equal in
fighting power to 1,000 English sol
diers, and we were shooting shrapnel
n; liui t, ruches when in th.' spring c'
1915 the Times succeeded in penetrat
ing through the censorship with a
statement of the facts as they exiriod
in Fiance. Coincldentnlly with the
publication of the news the Daily Mail
brought home the responsibility to the
war office In a series of editorials that
may be described us brutally frank.
"Now nine out of ten of the un
thinking blamed the director of the
Northcliffe press at that time. A wave
of Indignation swept over the country.
Charges were sprung by the privately
owned and politically controlled or
gans. It was charged, perhaps with a
color of truth, that the Northclllfc
press had been Inrgely responsible for
the appointment of Lord Kitchener
originally. It never occurred to these
unjournalistic minds that the respon
sibility imposed continuing responsi
bility for the proper conduct of the
war office."
Ono of the interesting matters still
to bo decided is the attitude of the
Irish party. Mr. Hedinond has now
perhaps the greatest opportunity he
ever had to obtain a settlement of the
homo rule question, since the position
of the new cabinet in commons will
he none too secure, and the national
ists will have a chance to win.
Speaking generally, the situation is
regard by the British public: with
greater hopefulness and it Is believed
that the crisis will be surrendered
without the need of a general election,
which the country would regard as a
disaster in tho midst of war.
Discussing Cabinet Assignments.
It is assumed that Lloyd-George
was probably able to submit to the
king a preliminary list of the princi
pal members of the cabinet. Doubt
less much remains to be done in the !
way of the allocation of the new posts,
but the premier still has plenty of
time before he hits to meet parliament
on Tuesday to complete the details.
Possibly many parliamentary and
j ministerial traditions will bo jettl
Isoned in the final result, but Lloyd-
Georgfe has a reputation for boldness,
and Is not a great sticker for tradi
tion. Therefore, some su prises may
appear in the distribution of the new I
offices. What Is apparent, however,
cs that the new ministry will not he as
already first assumed, a glorified war
council of a few members, but a min
istry on the old lines, although mu,h
smaller than the Asquith administra
tion. How Lloyd-George intends to get
over the difficulty of his own making,
when he asserted that the premier
was too much occupied with other I
matters to be able to preside over tho j
-r council. Is still one of the nrob-I
lemu unsolved.
' Inti rose in Cnbhiot.
The greatest Interest as to cabinet
positions centers In the personality of
the new foreign secretary. Two names
have been mentioned those of Lloyd -Georgo
himself and Lord Curzon. It
is generally assumed that, the latter j
will bo the favorite for the post, as
he has had experience abroad, and
commands public confidence here to
!an exceptional degree
I'ntil late last evening, those in
Lloyd-George's confidence, believed
that, following the precedent of the
Salisbury administration, Lloyd-
George would himself take the pos
of foreign secretary. Lord Northc liffe
'T strongly urged Lloyd-George to j
take the foreign secretaryship. I
I
consider that he is eminently fitted

of America and his sympathy for the

see his way to ac-
oepting .fhis view." '
The announcement, however, in the
, -. .
c.ourt circular that Lloyd-George had!
ent intention of taking the foreign
portfolio, and this apparently leaves
the field to Lord Curzon.
Previous to making his statement
concerning Lold-George, Lord Norlh
cliffe had definitely settled the ques
tion whether he would join the new
ministry when he said to a Central
News interviewer:
"I have no intention of joining the
new cabinet. I prefer to sit. in Print
ing House Square and Carmelite
house."
From Carmelite house Lord North
cliffe publishes the Daily Mail, and
from Printing House Square the
Times.
It is understood that Lloyd-George
aims to have a cabinet of twelve mem
bers, five of them unionists, five lib-
jerals. and two labor representatives.
From this number a small war cu-
cil is to be appointed.

Washington, Dec. 10. Congress will
get down to actual work this week.
Three measures are ready for imme
diate consideration. They are the
District, of Columbia prohibition bill,
Immigration bill and corrupt practices
measure.
Corrupt practice legislation prob
ably will be displaced temporarily by
the immigration bill when the senate
meets tomorrow, Inasmuch as demo
cratic leaders are considering revising
the former measure and pressing it
for final action. The immigration 1,111,
with its literacy test, probably will
pass tho senate without prolonged dis
cussion. The prohibition bill for the
District of Columbia is to be urged by
Senator Sheppard for the democrats,
and Senator Kenyon for the republi
cans. Its passage by the senate is ex
pected.
Senate democrats will caucus Wed
nesday to choose a successor to the
late Senator Clarke as president pro
tempore. Senator Saulsbury of Dela
ware Is the most active candidate. The
caucus also will consider the legisla
tive program. The house probably
will do little except routine worn un-
til after the Christmas recess.
President Wilson's vocational cdu-
'rational bill will be called up tomor
row and Cliai-man Hughes of the ju
ration committee hopes that It will
pass before night. The purpose of the
measure is to help slate schools,
teaching agriculture and trades, by
(paying teacners salaries in pari huh
establishing schools for tho develop-
metiet of instructors in those branches.
Chairman Lever of the agriculture
committee hopes to get his cotton
standardization bill up this week, too.

In official circles it is felt that the.

by further hostilities.
The allies, on the. other hand, have I
shown that they are absolutely op
