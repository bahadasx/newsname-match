II
E
Leaders Say France Must
Follow Example and Con
. centrate Power
By William Philip Simras.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Paris, Dec. 11. More and more Kng
land's limited war council idea is gain
ing support in France. More and more
is Lloyd-George being regarded as Kng
land's man of the hour.
France isn 't wasting time in pessimis
tic reflections over Rumania and
Greece. On the contrary, the nation is
setting its jaws more firmly and de
manding action that will be immediate
and daring. With the slowdown of ac
tivity along the western front forced by
chilling and unceasing rain, clammy
fogs and seas of mud, events in Kng
laud, Greece and Rumania loom all the
more prominently here.
An accurate reflection of Franco's
spirit today was given by Henry Chcr
on, a prominent senator, who publishes
in today's Petit Parinou this analysis
of France's situation:
"The crisis of authority reigning in
France is not the fault of the republic
for if ever a republic proved itself
worthy it is now, while traversing
tragic events. It is not the failure ot
legislature, for when the truth is known
the legislature, it will be secu, has sec
onded, not hindered, government nction.
"Then why is authority lacking f Be
cause "we have used peace time meth
ods instead of doing what we should
have done what more than ever we
must do and that is to concentrate di
rection and assure vigorous prosecution
of the war. ' '
The senator concludes with the decla
ration that France needs "few men but
men of less talk and more action; with
a concentration of governmental author
ity like that of which England lias just
given us an example."
"We must follow thnt example," the
article concludes. "The present premier
has not fuih?d to display all qualities
necessary in facing the heavy responsi
bilities of the present hour. It will suf
fice to have him adopt war methods.
France demands a spirit of decision, of
firmness and of courageous acts. For
tune has never smiled on any but men
who were energetic and audacious."
Cheron is an accurate barometer of
public opinion in the present govern
mental situation. This spirit of France
will undoubtedly find expression short
ly in acts paralleling England's recent
decision.
Scio's Parent-Teacher association has
voted to build a gymnasium for the use

This is the declaration of Francisco

terviewer says he went to Villa's head
quarters at Quint Luz, the second day
of the occupation -of -the city of Chi

''Do you know the mayor of El

Asked what he intended to do, he rfi
plied:
''Drive them out, or make them fight
and after the(kae gone I will make a
gap between the two countries so wide
and deep that no American will ever
be able to steal Mexican laud, gold or
oil."
' 'General" Villa was asked: ''How
could you make the daring attack on
Colonel Slocum's forces at Columbus
and get away across the big plains!''
"Easy," Villa answered. ''I was
awake; they were sleeping and it took
them too long to wake up.'
'You nrust have had ninny men."
"Yes, I had about 300."
The interviewer snid he was careful
not to ask Villa about his iiljured foot,
on the advice of General Silazar, with
whom he first talked and who by the
same general's advices, not to contra
dict Villa in any way. Villa's foot is
still stiff, he said, though the wound
he received in the battle of Guerrero
has healed.

ENGLAND TO IKE
SUPREME EFFORT
IE
Lloyd-George Stirs England
To Its Depths by Determ
ined Action
FEVER OF ENTHUSIASM
SWEEPS THE EMPIRE
Nation's Vigor Concentrated
On Preparation for Next
Year's Fightmg
London, Dec. 11. England's every
resource is to be turned into the war
Every luxury is to be cut off; every
activity turned into the serious busi
ness of fighting.
Nothing could be clearer than this
decision in the public 'a belief after an
nouncement of David Lloyd-George's
new cabinet today and consideration
of preliminary measures to be enacted.
The little Welshman becomes prac
ticallv dictator of England. Associated
with him in the "war council" are
Earl t'urzon, who will be government
lender in the house of commons; Ar
thur Henderson and Iord Milner, min
isters without portfolio. Because Cur
zon and Law will be largely occupied
with their duties in the two houses, the
war council really narrows down to a
permanent membership of throe men
and two of these, Milner and Hender
son, are without other tasks than that
of mWhbers of the war council. They
are left entirely free in order to prose
cute the war, with Lloyd-George.
Thus the government forces are align
ed for efficiency.
This new government also plans ef
ficiency through reforms as to the pub
ic, economy.
It is believed practically certain that
Lloyd-George's regime will institute
absolute prohibition on spirits through
out Great Britain with severe restric
tions on beer and wine. Further manu
facture of the spirituous liquors will be
forbidden.
One of Lloyd-George's new "depart
ment heads ' is a tood controller Iord
Devonport. His appointment it is a
post was taken to presage issuance
of institution of all the internal eco
nomics in connection with the nation's
food supply necessary to reduce waste
Meatless days each week are expected.
Forecast also in the new govern
ment s ideas of unremitting, reinvig
orated conduct of the war, is the cut
ting off of all unnecessary luxuries in
private life and Concentration upon
onlv necessary work.
AH the nation's vigor is to be di
rected nt preparing lor the spring drive
and in this winters operations.
Along Business Lines
Primarily, Lloyd-George's "recon
struction of government" is a recon
struction along business lines. Business
men, new in politics, make up largely
his advisory board. Such a businessman
is Lord Devonport, who has been man
ager of the Port of London, ami who
now becomes lood controller. Among
the other 'department heads in
the new lineup are these business men;
Baron Rhonda, made president of the
local government board and who was
Davis Thomas, coal magnate; Si Al
bert Stanley, made president of the
hoard of trade, new general manager of
the London underground railway, who
received his technical education and
his training in America, having been
street railway manager in Detroit and
New Jersey; Sir Alfred Mond, made
first commissioner of works, who is
head of several big corporations in Lon
in? association; mr .loscpn i nion -ia
clay, made shipping controller, is a
big ship owner.
In tow other posts Lloyr Gcorge se
lected Rowland E. j'rotliero, for presi
dent of the board of agriculture, who
has made a success as manager of the
Duke of Bedford's great estates; and
Herbert A. L. Fisher, made president

a brilliant record as head of Sheffield
