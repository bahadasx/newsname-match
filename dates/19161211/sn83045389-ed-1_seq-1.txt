to make her trip from that port to
N v. I.ondon Her tirst voyage to this
side ,,f the Atlantic, which ended at
Baltimore, was ma-le in twenty-three

of the merchant submarine Deutsch

to-day that she will start back to
America almost immediately. Her de
parture on another transocean voyage
is expected as .soon as repairs made
necessary by her collision with a tug
off New I.ondon shortly before her de
parture for Germany, are completed.
In fact, it was noised around in the
Capital to-day. that so successful have
the two voyages of the I >eut schland
been, that an entire flc-ot of commercial
submarines plying between Germany
and all neutral ports of importance is
an early possibility.
It was learned to-day that the $2.

STATUS MK> TO ItlU KDII
Two ca rdinnl factors stand out n
the uiln.ls ??f otllcials. First, that many
such proposals original ? in ilertnan
circles. a ltd. socotiil. that their r? -iteta
tion has been driving allied talesmen
to an extremity ?>f refutation from
which it would he very embarrassing
for them to recede.
Without in any way passing; on the
uhimaie outcomo" of the war, it is f?lt
here that Hermany has largely achiev
ed her objectives, and that she is in a
position to treat on the basis of her
present gains without subjecting her
self to the inevitable losses of men and
tnonev caused I' y* further h t. 1 i t i es.
The allies, on the other hand, have
shown that they are absolutely oppos
ed to peace now. They have left not
the least doubt that they would regard
mediation at this time as unfriendly
It is firmly believed here in ofllci.i!
circles that such an attempt by this
government would subject the I ulted
States to the charge of partisan in
terference in the war. Most embar
rassing of all the rumors, perhaps, is
the constant reiteration that Ambassa
1 dor tSerard is returning to ijermatiy
with peace proposals from the Presi
dent. This is declared, not only to l>o
' false, but lo be actually dangerous.
It is said to have created a very un
favorable teeling in both belligerent
-roups, a feeling of intense irritation
among she allies and of unfounded
hopefulness amongst the Cerman peo
ple. who appear to be well satisfied
with the war's results and eager for
its end.

I' vn iir.iti.mi i-u noi'i:
The Federal probe into high prices
of food has developed one fact so far
that stands out above all others, of
ficials declared to-night. That is that
the American methods of handling
foodstuff after it has been delivered
in centers of population, are years be
hind the marketing methods of Ku
rope.
In addition to attempting to bring
the law to bear for the punishment of
the evident combinations aimed at
holding commodities for top prices, an
organized attempt on the part of the
Department of Agriculture to revolu
tionize market methods will be made
in the near future.
Otllclals of the department said to
night It needed just such a crisis as
the present one to bring out the weak
ness in transport methods which now
appears so glaringly. The use of mod
ern market methods doubtless has
some effect in lowering prices, it was
declared, by economic, methods of get
ting the food from the shipper to the
public.
Department of Justice otlicials ex
pect soon to put a bill in the hands of
administration leaders in Congress tie
signed to form a readier weapon t<? hit
at hiuli pric 'nihtnations than the
j conspiracy laws now in existence and
the Sherman antitrust law. The lack
of adequate laws remains the greatest
obstacle hi the Federal probe, it was
stated lo-uighl.

fitl-:sSix; h'tlll ACTION
Meanwhile, under strong pressure
from their constituents, members of
the Senate and House ate pressing for
action b\ the various committees to
\\ Inch their bills tb signed to lower
living cost have been referred. The
administration is counseling a slowe.*,
surer method, though, and the commit
tee chairmen are studying the bills be
fore them with the idea of bringing
out the one considered most desirable
by the government's legal experts.
The committee chairmen are also
awaiting suggestions from the White
House and the Departments of Cum
men-e. Justice, and Agriculture, where
a mass of evidence is being considered
in an effort to determine !he real
causes of soaring prices.
Administration lenders still are di
vided on the embargo question. The
opposition of the White House to such
legislation has not changed and there
is hardl\ even an outside chance that j
such legislation will le brought before
either house of Congress ' -r action.

j the endless series of crises, a climax

I though not on the side t<? which it has

Constantino has turned t<? Garrett

1 Athens. The monarch litis just bidden
I farewell?perhaps for the last time in
peace?to the British and Russian min
isters. after an extended audience,
when he sent for Mr. iMoppets.
There is every indication to support
an unofficial dispatch that the repre
sentatives of the allies had handed
Constantino an ultimatum.
What passed between the Kin,; and
the American diplomatist probablj will
he the secret of the Washington State
Department for some time. To-morrow,
however. Mr. Droppers nia> he called
upon to take over I lie representation
of entente interests in Greece.
It is assumed here that in his talk
with the American minister the Greek
ruler made one last atempt to make
clear to the neutral world, through
the United States, the case of Greece
in the greatest crisis of her history.
Meanwhile, reports from Herman
sources continue to predict Greek In
tervention on the side ot the centi.il
empires. One dispatch states that
wireless communication has been re
established between Greece and Turkey.
