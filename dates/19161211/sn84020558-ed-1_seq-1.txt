WASHINGTON, Dec. 10. An effort by the American Federat.on of
Labor to induce congress to grant wajc and salary increase to all employes
of the United States government from president down, was planned at a

Resolutions were adopted setting forth that government salaries have
not kept pace with the coit of necessaries of life and directing that congress
be earnestly pet.t oned to grrnt increases ranging frcm ten to 33 1-3 per
cent to all government employes.
The proposals are as follows: '
f ,,ErSl0y" rece:vin3 "lartcs f than 1,000 per annum, an increase
or 33 1-3 per cent, provided that no employe shall receive compensation at
a rate of less than $3 .cr day if paid by the day. $30.00 per month if paid
by the month, or $1,030 per year if paid by the year.
Employes receiving salaries of $1,000 or more but less than $1500 per
month, an increase of 25 per cent.
Employes receiving salaries of $1500 or more but less than $2,000 per
annum, an increase of 20 per cent.
Employes receiv.ng salaries of $2,000 or more but less than $2500 per
annum, an increase of 15 per cent.
Employes receiving salaries of $2500 or more, ten per cent
Should the plan be accepted by congress without any reservation the

George Hilzinger, county attor

republican inspector in the look-see
at the ballots, to begin in Maricopa
county this morning. Mr. Hilzinger
arrived from Tucson in company
with Judge John H. Camobell, one
of the attorneys for' Thomas E.

governorship.
Because he is Campbell's attor

f Proctor, a Hunt booster, Hon. E.
S. Clark of Prescott will be here
to collaborate with the other Camp
bell attorneys in the main contest.
As all the state ballots are to be
brought here, the Navajo county
case will be settled in the local
court.
There are three sheriff contests
involved in the ballots that are to
be brought here. One in Navajo
lies between R. L. Newman, Re
publican, who was elected, and Joe
Woods. Democrat, who was rot
satisfied with the count. In Mohave
county, there is precinct called
Cedar Clade; where one man acted
as judge, inspector, cjerk and jani
tor of the polls, and cast the only
vote. It was a straight democratic
ballot.
The one vote was cast out, and
this caused one Cohenour, a Re
publican, to receive one more vote
than his democratic opponent for
sheriff. So, another contest was
started. The J. G. Cash-Frank
Haynes clash in Greenlee county,
will also be interfered with by the
bringing of ballots to Phoenix, but
the most terrible result, will be the
ball-up in the contest over the con
ttableship at Ajo,

Congress To Get
Busy This Week
On Pending Bills
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10. Oorisresn
will get down to actual work this week.
Three measures are reauy 101 immediate
consideration. They are the District of
Columbia prohibition bill, immigration
bill and corrupt practices measure.
Corrupt practice legislation probably
will be displaced temporarily by the
immigration bill when the senate
meets tomorrow, inasmuch as demo
cratic leaders are eonsiderinK revising
the former measure and pressing It for
urna! action. The immigration bill with
its literacy test probably will pass; the
senate without .prdlonged discussion.
The prohibition bill for the District of
Columbia Is to be urged by Senator
Sheppard from the Democrats and
Senator Kenyon for the Kepublicans.
Its passage by the senate is expected.
Senate Democrats will caucus
Wednesday to choose a successor to
the late Senator Clark as president
pro tempore. Senator Saulsbury of
Delaware is the most active candidate.
The caucus also will consider the legis
lative program. The house probably
will do little expect routine work until
after the Christmas recess.
President Wilson's vocational edu-"
cation bill will be called up tomorrow
and Chairman Hughes of the education
committee hopes that it will pass be
fore night. The purpose of the measure
is to help state schools, teaching agri
culture and trades, by paying teachers
salaries in part and establishing schools
for the development of instructors in
these branches.
Chairman) I-ver of the agriculture
committer hopes to get his cotton
standardization bill up this week too.
Spe aker Clark has not abandoned his
fight for a shorter Christmas recess.
I'resident Wilson will discuss legis
lative (uesions this week with several
members of the Renate and house, in
chiding Senator Sheppard, chief prohi
bition advocate in the senate, where a
determined effort it to be made soon
to pass a District of Columbia prohi
bitnon bill.
Almost every night during Ihe week
Mr. Wilson wiil tie busy wirti social
engagements, including a theater party
tomorrow night, a dinner given by him
to the cabinet Tuesday night, a dinner
given by him Thursday night to state
executives attending the governors
conference and a dinner in his honor
to be given 1-Yiday night by the vice

As president of the American Red

No Peace Offers Made By U. S.
(Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec 10. Offers of mediation for suggestions of peace
to the European nations have not besn made by the United States, and
will not be broached by this government in the near future unless there is
some quite unexpected turn in world events.
These facts are stated authoritatively by one of the highest officials
of the government to counteract reports to the contrary.
In official circles it is felt that the increasing and apparently authori
tative rumors that the United States is planning some move for peace are
calculated to destroy chances of peace and to defeat their own ends. Ac
cordingly an official denial has been contemplated, probably through the
state department. The president, however, has preferred to disassociate
himself entirely from any such announcement no matter how made, in
order that he might stand untrammeled on his original offer of mediation.
Two cardinal facts stand out in the minds of officials. First, that
many such proposals originate in German circles, and second, that their
reiteration has been driving allied statesmen to an extremity of refutation
from which it would be very embarrassing for them to recede.
Without in any way passing on the ultimate outcome of the war it is
felt here that Germany is in a position to treat on the basis of her present
gains without subjecting herself to the inevitable losses of men and money
caused by further hostilities.
The allies, on the other hand, have shown that they are absolutely
opposed to peace now. It is firmly believed in official circles that an
attempt at mediation by this government would subject the United States
to the charge of partisan interference in the war.
The government will watch an opportunity to offer mediation. When
official reports from all sides indicate that such a movement might suc
ceed, it will be scrutinized very carefully before being attempted.

WITH THE MUTISM ARM IKS IN
KKANCK, Dec. 7. (via Ixindon. Dec. .
(From a .staff correspondent of tho
Associated l'ress) The present phase
of (hi. fifrbtinir cli.nv V,a lii(.a. r...
may be classed as essentially imper
Isonal by day but intensely personal by
night.
During the short gray winter, dav
light, big guns back of the fighting
lines hurl tons of high explosives
against the German positions. The
largest are far, far away and on thick,
misty days the results of this contin
luous, harrassing fire are conjectured
rather than seen. This is the irnper
'.sotial side of war.
I With the coming of night, however,
all is changed. Then men meet face to
Aap, and hand to hand and primitive,
'methods of mortal combat come again
j into play in the midst of all the genius
c.f war. The long, dark nights are ideal
I for trench raids.
I Few of them ever gain the distinct ion
'of mention in the'jufficial cominunica
itions but in the aggregate they yield
; most satisfying military result's. Not
only is there . cumulative effect upon
the German casualty list, but many
prisoners are taken and useful infor
mation obtained.
Styles in trench raiding change from
time to time. Just now the popular
method seems to be to bombard a given
section of a trench and. then set up -i
barrage or curtain of shells behind
wUlch the raiding party Vrosses that
perilous strip of shell ploughed ground
known as "No Man's Land."
The raiders dash into the trench,
clear it of its defenders in any way the
exigencies require and then dash liome
again for shelter from the inevitable re
taliatory shell fire from the Germans.
It is one of the strange psychologies
1 of this strange war that wnile grtti

the German trenches with the raiders,
