NO MOVE MADE
BY WILSON TO
BRING PEACE
Offer to Mediate Not
Contemplated Now,
Official Says
GERARD IS NOT
MESSAGE BEARER
Mediation Rumors Are
Dangerous, View of
Administration
Washington, Der. ?o. Offers of
mediation or suggestions of peace to
the European nations have not been
made by the United State.?, they are
not now being borne acp
i y Ambassador Gerard, and will not
be- broached by this government in
the near futan unless there ?> pome
quite unexpected turn in world
events.
These .statement.? are made author
itatively by one of the highest ?ini?
ci?is of the government to counter?
act reports to the contrary which
have been generally published, much
to the embarrassment of the Admin?
istration and to the misleading of
foreign nations. The fact? set forth
and the details following may be said
to express the Administration views
of the situation as affecting pros?
pects for peace.
In official circles it is felt that the
increasing and apparently authorita?
tive rumors that the United ?States
is planning some move for peace aro
calculated above all else to destroy
chances of peace, and, no matter
what their origin, to defeat their
own ends.
Official Denial Contemplated
The misunderstanding has become
.so serious that an official denial ha?
been contemplated, probably through
h. .-tat? Department. The Presi?
dent, however, has preferred to dis?
sociate himself entirely from any
such announcement, no matter how
made, that he may stand untram?
melled on his original offer of me?
diation at the beginning of the war.
Two cardinal facts stand out in the
minds of officials. First, that many such
proposal? originate in German circles,
and second, tnat their reiteration has
been driving Allied statesmen to an ex?
tremity of refutation 'rom which it
would bo Very embarrassing for them
to recede
Without In any way passing on the
ultimate outcome of the war, it is felt
here that Germany has largely achieved
her objectives, and that ?he is in a po
?ition to treat on the basis of her pres?
ent gains without subjecting herself to
the inevitable losses of men and money
caused by further hostilities.
Gerard Has No Proposal
The Allies, on the other hand
.?ho\wt that they are absolutely opposed
to peace now. They have left not the
least doubt that they would reirard
mediation at this time as unfriendly. It
is firmly believed in official circles hero
that sii'th an attempt by this govern?
ment would subject the I'nited States
to the charge Of partisan interference?
in the war.
Most, embarrassing of all the in
mot?, perhaps, is the constant reitera-;
non that Ambassador Gerard Is return-(
in?* to Germany with oeace proposal? ,
from the President. Thi? is declared
aty to h.? false, but to he netuall)
dar.gerou?. It is said to have en
an unfortunate feeling in both <??
erent group?; a feeling of intense irri
tation among the Allies and of un?
founded hopefulness among th?? i.er
man people, who appear to be well sat
?rltk tl .? war's results and eager
tor its end.
The g<>\< rnment will watch an op?
portunity to offer mediati'>n with a
zeaiuusnes? that could not fail to come
frorn the chance to put an end to_ tb*
most calamitous war in history. When
official report? from al! side.? indicate
that such a movement might ?jrceed it
uill be scrutinized carefully before be?
ing attempted. Until then unf?
agitation by persons not in a position
to know the fundamental and dec:?.v?_
attitude of the belligerent nation? i?
regarded as best calculated tu defeat
-y end? in view.

Caledonia's Captain Faces
Death; Rammed U-Boat
Captured by Germans and Will Meet rryatt's Fate, London
Fears?Test of New Cabinet Seen as Britons Favor
Reprisals?Britannia's Commander Also Prisoner
London, Dee. 10. The British pas
lenger steamship Caledonia, of 0,22;
tons, waa r?ur.k by a Gen?an submarin?
en December 4, after she attempted tc
sink the U-boat by ramming, announce?
B (ierman Admiralty statement to-night
The Hubmariiie was slightly damaged.
The commander of the steamer. Cap?
tain Blaikie, was made prisoner by the
Germans, and it is feared that he will
be hanged, as was Captain Charles
Kryatt, of th-? merchant steamer Brus?
sels, last July.
The capture of Captain Blaikie may
furnish an opportunity to test the tem?
per of the now British government.
At the time of Captain Fryatt'? death
many demands were heard in Kngland
that the government notify the Ger?
mans of reprisals in such an event.
Captain Fryatt wa. accused by the
Germans of trying to ram a submarine.
Ho was captured a year after the al?
leged attempt.
The Caledonia was reported sunk on
December 8 by Lloyd's Agency. She
was In the service of the British gov
ernment. The German official state?
ment read?:
"The British passenger ?hip Caledo?
nia attempted on December 4 to ram a
German submarine. The submarine,
which was slightly damaged, fired a
torpedo, which sank the steamer. The
commander of the steamer. Captain
Blaikie, was made prisoner."
The Germans also have captured the
captain of the British steamer Britan
, tua, which was reported sunk to-day.
It is not known whether they have any
grievances against him. Fifteen of the
Britannia's crew are missing.
Three oeher vessels have been sun?;
! and two damaged, Lloyd's announce?.
: Reports from Stockholm say that U
! boats in the Arctic Sea have sunk six
I teen ammunition steamers bound for
I.ussia during the last few*" weeks.
The latest submarina victims are the
Norwegian steamers Modum, 1,913 tons,
; Amicitia, 1,111 tons, and Falk. the
British steamer Fortk, 525 tons, and
the Spanish steamer Bravo, 1,214 tons.
The vessels damaged were the British
steamers Harlington and Harlyn.

London, Dec. lp. Trouble is brew

The exact conditions are obscured
by the constantly conflicting reports
from every tide. Officials here are
extremely sceptical nf reports from
Greek and Teutonic sources that the
situation has improved.
Rumors of the secret mobilization of

Berlin dispatches. Th? "Yossi.che :

the blockade of Greek ports, ConsUn

proaching apparently is not shared by
the Greek authorities. Reuter's corre?

tion of the Ministry tr, five members

usually found on the aide of the gov?
ernment, which he hae been credited
with saving in more than one erisi?
There are two reasons for the reso?

Announcing Cabinet,

Henderson and Milner To

. .
London, Dec. ID.- The official lint
of the new Cabinet, issued to-night,
bears out the promise of a body effi?
ciently constructed to carry through
the most radical war measures, both
external and internal.
Lloyd George has given himself
almost dictatorial power-?, and he has
included in the ministry, besides tho
experienced politicians, men who are
experts in lines of business which
have become an essential part of th?
war government.
In addition to the drastic measure?
for bringing the efficiency of the na?
tion to its highest pitch, which were
announced this morning, it is
learned to-nu.it that the new gov?
ernment will make one of its first
measures for the complete control of
liquor.
Prohibition of all use of ?pirita, ex?
cept as medicine, and severe restric?
tion on beer are expected.
Control Spirits Manufacture
The whole manufacture of spirits
probably will come under state con?
trol within a few weeks, and the new
and accumulated spirits used only
for war purposes. Distillation of
spirituous drinks will be prohibited.
The War Council, which will hold
daily sessions, directing the war, and
will have full control of all measures,
will, as forecast, be headed by the?
Premier, though he refused to have
.*squith sit in it when compromises
wore under discussion. With him
will be Lord Milner and Arthur Hen?
derson, both without portfolio?, able
to devote their whole time to the
Council and expected to do the major
part of its work.
Karl Curzon, who will be govern?
ment leader In the House of Lords,
and Andrew Bonar Law, who will bs
both leader in Commons and Chan
<*ellor of the Exchequer, will be tho
other members of the Council.
