PARI?, France, Dec 11. Premier
Briand was busy all day Sunday
seeing not only politicians but
prominent business men and manufac

"War Council of Five.
In addition to forming a war coun-

"In course of conversations he had
k ith prominent men, premier Briand
announced that he Intended to give a
free hand to the ministers, under sec
letaries and directors forming part of.
the new ministry.
Absolute rowers Granted.
"The most absolute powers will be
granted to them and if It is found that
the methods meet resistance or that
i--rtain habits are persisted In. these
powers will be still further increased
and drastic measures taken. The com
position of the new combination will

It, a Socialist.
Aristide Briand is a Socialist. In
:!. at the ase of 10, he was elected
in the chamber of deputies by the So
. inlist miners of St. Etlenne depart
ment. His rise since has been rapid.
Briand was born in Nantes and
oucated in the local public schools. He
uttended no college or university hot
studied law under private tutors and
v. as soon admitted to practice.
In the chamber of deputies ho was
tl.e force behind the "church and state
. paratlon bill" and in this long and
3 "-rce political fight he displayed great
tact and moderation, but tireless energy
. nd persistency.
Tn T90-S he was made minister or
public instruction and worship, and In
he became also minister of justice.
Has Strong; Personality.
July. 1909, Briand succeeded Cleraen
tau as prime minister. As is well
3. ii own. Socialists of the extreme and
lailical schools do not approve of mem-l.c.-s
of tlieir party participating in the
r Uvc work of government in any
clitlon movement. Briand's personal
I'OWfr has kept him in a post of leader
ship and he is also prominent in Social-i--
councils, but he is always the object
ct vicious criticism by the extreme
xulicals.
His tlevatlon to what amounts to a
dictatorship in the present crisis is
rather a tribute to his personal abili
ties than a concession to the Socialists;
nevertheless it helps strengthen the
hooia'lst organization whieh is alreadv
it tremendous power in France.

INDICATIONS today point more

their retreat from Bucharest, will
be drawn along the Buzen river,
forming the southern boundary of
their northern province of Mol

OXPOX. KXG. Dec. 11 Premi. r
Lloyd-George is ilL He was un
able to go to Buckingham palace
today with members of his cabinet to
receive the seals of office from king
George.
Official announcement was made that
the premier was suffering from a se
vere chill and that on the advice of
his physicians he was remaining in
doors today.
Premier Lloyd-George has sent the
following to all members of the house
of commons, it was announced, of
ficially today:
"The king has entrusted me with the
task of forming a government. I have
carried out the command. I had hoped
to make a statement to the house on
Tuesday. I now find it to be impossi
ble. On Tuesday. Mr. Bonar Law. as
leader in the house, will move adjourn
ment till Thursday.
"The one predominant task before the
government is the vigorous prosecution
of the war to a triumphant conclusion.
I feel confident the government can
lelv on your support as long as they
devote their energies effectively to
that end." . .
The offcial list of the new ministry
follows the unofficial forecast with two
or three minor changes:
Lloyd-Georce. lord Milner. earl Cur
zon Andrew Bonar Law and Arthur
Henderson, which is officially termed
the war cabinet, while the others, who
ordinarily have been designated as cab
inet minister, are called heads of de
partments. Giles 1'rliue Minister More Power.
This novel organization concentrates
far more power in the hands of the
prime minister than the British system
has ever known. Lloyd George has not
hesitated to place himself in the posi
tion more closely resembling a dicta
torship than he was willing to give his
predecessor.

An attack by senator Works
of California, on the senate
committee amendment to the Immigra

measure any reference to tne socalled
oeotlemea's passport agreement be
tween tie United States and Japan,
caused the senate today to consider the
subject behind closed doors, because
treaty rights are involved in the Issue.
Japanese Embatuy Make Inquiry.
The executive session was ordered
after senator Works had reserved the
right to demand a separate vote on
the amendment which was incorporated
at the request of the state department,
after an inquiry about tbe original bill
bad been made by the Japanese em
bassy. Before the doors werer closed, senator
Works declared the amendment was
designed purely in the interests of Ja

oil tract, and that the entire tract of
SS.Oftt) acres be held exclusively bv the
government for the naval reserve. If
