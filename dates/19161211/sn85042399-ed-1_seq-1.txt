Park Lighting
Bill Problem;
Who will pay for the lighting of
the paiko, Is the question with which
the council wrestled over a half hour
Tuesday night and finally dropped
until after election. The present ar
rangement includes leaving a few
lights on around the Butler-Perozzl
fountain and the drinking fountains
and one or two down through Chau
tauqua park.
Briefly stated, the situation In re
gard to park ilghtlng is as follows:
The electric light department has

Strlckland, the light department isjed, with a view to reduce the tax

park board has refused to pay this! The financial condition of the
and, according to Mr. Ashcraft, threw county and of the Individual property
the keys down in the office and re-1 owners is such that taxes are a heavy
rusea to nave anyming to qo wun;
the park lighting. A motion to
charge the park lighting to the gen-
eral fun'i was lost because it was that the following recommendations
deemed that the general fund would j will meet general approval' of tax
have a hard time meeting Its other i payers:
obligations. The light department
therefore remains "the goat" until
after election, when things will have
settled down so that a definite ar
rangement can be made.
Lights are necessary at the foun
tains so that vandals will not steal
the money from the jcup venders or
break the glass. The Butler-Perozzi
land was deeded to the city and the
fountain erected with the provision
that the fountain he lighted, and the
donors state that rather than run the
risk of having vandals mutilate the
fountain, they will fence the whole
works up. Residents of the Granite
street neighborhood go home at night
through the park and, as Mr. Lamb
expressed it, "put up an awful how-1
when the lights were turned off alto
gether." Mr. Stricklajid stated that the
lights could be turned off at 10
o'clock, after a suggestion by Mr.
Banta, by installation of an automatic
switch, thus effecting a small saving,
but Mr. Poot called the council's at
tention to the fact that the switch
would cost more than the saving
made between now and election. Mr.
Banta in the course of the discussion
ventured the opinion that "anyone
who went up there after 10 o'clock
wouldn't want lights."
At present standing most all of the
lights in the park are turned off and
enough burning to protect the- foun
tain and light the main patch. The
cost of the current Is about $13 per
month under the present arrange
ment.
The whole argument revolved
around the fact that the park board
had refused to pay for the lighting
and that the electric light department
was determined not to be "the goat,"
since it was the goat last year for
several thousand dolalrs of street
lights and the impression was liable
to be gained that it does not cost artfSp
thing to manufacture current. I
Mr. Nlninger made a positive stand
on the matter, advocating "since the
park board had agreed to run the
park for a two-mill levy, make them
do it."

Taxpayers' League
Recommends Changes
The Jackson County Taxpayers'
League met last Thursday at Med-
i ford and presented the following rec-
ommemlatlons to the county court,
who placed them upon file, receiving
them with thoughtful consideration:
To the County Court, Jackson Coun
ty, Ore.
Gentlemen: We, the budget com
mittee of the Jackson Coutny Tux
payers' League, to whom has ben re
ferred the matter of tax levies as ad
vertised In your budget for 1916, ask
burden end must be reduced to a
mlnliuum
We believe from our investigation.
While it appears that county
school, high school, general road, tax
collecting and assessor's expense is
in excess of what should be required,
we believe the levies advertised can
well be reduced below the amount
asked for.
For circuit court expense we find
the actual expense has been below
$4,000 and recommend that this levy
be reduced to this amount.
For county court general expense
and traveling expenses we believe a
reduction of $1,000 should be made.
For juvenile court expense also a re-
! ductlon of $1,000.
j rigid curtailment
We believe by a
of expenditures
these amounts can be saved to the
taxpayers.
For county advertising purposes
we recommend the elimination of
$1,000 for promotion expense.
The levy for the care of the poor
should be materially reduced. We
recommend the adoption of methods
by which a saving can be made, and
suggest that this levy be reduced at
least $5,000. '
Court house expense can he re
duced by the reduction on incidental
expenses and by the consolidation of
janitor and jailor. We recommend
that this be done and that this levy
be reduced at least $500.
We ask that a reduction of at least
$800 be made in the levy for county
surveyor, $1,000 for school superin
tendent's expense, and $1,000 for the
enforcement of the prohibition law.
WThlle there is a vague possibility
of a special election being called dur
ing the year, such an election is very
improbable. We believe the levy of
$3,500 for this purpose should be
eliminated.
Vary respectfully,

the former owners, are undecided as
