Indication* today point mora
strongly than ever to the probability
that the new defensive line of the
Rumanians, following: their retreat
from Bucharest, will be drawn along
the Buseu river, forming the southern
boundary of their northen province
of Moldavia.
Additional reports from Petrograd
Indicate a considerable measure of
•access by the Rumanians' northern
army in holding up the Teutonio ad
vance, northeast along the railroad
from Ploeshti, north of Bucharest, to
the town of Buseu, located at about
the center-of the Beseu river line,
which stretches westward to the low
er reaches of the Danube.
It Is necessary to the apparent pur
pose of the Rumanians for them to
prevent an Austro-German advance
here until- the Rumanian forces fur
ther south in eastern Wallachla, re
treating from the region between
Bucharest and Tchernavoda, have
reached the Buzeu river line, unless.
Indeed, the' Rumanian military au
thorities have decided to retain a
hold on lfiore' of eastern' Wallachla
than It now seems their purpose to
defend. These Rumanian forces are
threatened hot only by Field Mar
sh? von Meckensen's Danube army,
but ,»y new contingents of Bulgarians
which have crossed the Danube be
tween Silistrla and Tchernavoda.
Meanwhile the Russians are ham
mering-^vway. at the Austro-German
line on the western frontier of Mol
davia and report making headway la
the y&Ueyrir: running toward the1 west.
Their object apparently is not only
to hold the'-Moldavian frontier safe,'
but possibly to achieve an eventual
success in working well Into Hungary
and cutting in behind the Austro
German supply line leading into Ru
mania from the north.
There has been little fighting of an
important nature on the other fronts.
In Macedonia the Serbians report
having driven the Bulgarians back in
one sector northeast of Monastir. On
the Franco-Belgian front, little has
developed beyond intermittent artil
lery activity in the Somme area and
aviation operations on a considerable
scale.

Berlin, Dec. 11, (by wireless to Say

about one-sixth of their army, besides

Not only has this loss to the Ru

continues the writer, but the Teutonic
victory has made possible the short

German Submarine Arrives
safely—Made Voyage
in 19 Days.
®*jjln, Dec. 11.—(By wireless to
Sayvllle.)—The Oerman commercial
submarine Deutschland completing a
quick trip home from the United
8tat«« arrived yesterday off the mouth
of the Weser.
The arrival of the- Deutsohland at
a German port marks the successful
completion of the second routed trip
of this commercial undersea boat to
the United States. On her voyage
Just finished she made the passage
in 1* days, having left New London,
Conn., November 21. This bettered
considerably the record of her previ
ous eastward trip which, starting from
Baltimore, took her 23 days. Her
two westward voyages occupied re
spectively 16 and 21 days.
The Deutschland, which is the only
commercial craft of her type that has
succeeded in reaching this country
from Germany, her sister ship the
Bremen having been lost on her out
ward voyage, was forced to make two
starts from New London on this re
turn trip. On her first attempt No
vember 17 she collided with an es
corting tug and had to put back to
port. She was able to put out again
four days later, this time without mis
hap.
The Deutschland on both of her
trips brought valuable cargoes, chief
ly of dyes and chemicals. On her
present voyage she took a cargo esti
mated at 92,000,600 in value, and offi

London, Dec. 11.—Premier Lloyd
George is ill. He was unable to go to
Buckingham Palace today with mem
bers of his cabinet to receive the Seals
of offices from King George.
Official announcement was made
that the premier was suffering from a
severe chill and that on the iadv|ce of
his physicians he was remaining in
doors today.
Official announcement was made
last night tltai the government had
been constituted with a war cabinet
comprising the following:
Premier David David Lloyd-George
Lord President of the Council, Karl
Curzon, who also will be government
leader In the house of lords Arthur
Henderson, minister without port
folio Lord Milner, minister without
portfolio, and Andrew Bonar Law,
chancellor of the exchequer who has
been asked by the premier to act as
leader in the house of commons and
also as member of the war cabinet
without being expected to attend regu
larly.
An important point in this novel or
ganisation is that it concentrates far
more power in the hands of tht prime
minister than the British systvm has
ever known before. Mr. Lloyd
George's proposals to Premier Asquith
were for a war council of which the
premier should not be a member, al
though he should have the power of
passing on its work. Mr. Lloyd
George has not hesitated to place him
self in the position more closely re
sembling a dictatorship than he was
willing to give his predecessor.
Cabinet of Four.
For practical purposes the govern
ment will be by a cabinet of four.
Whether there is any plan for meet
ings of all the heads of departments
of cabinet rank Is not known yet but
councils In which the ministers of for
eign affairB, war and the admiralty
participate with the others whose du
ties directly concern war measures
will be certain.
A meeting of the privy council will
be held tomorrow for the swearing in
of the ministers. The prime minister
will make a speech in the house of
commons Tuesday In which he will
declare the policy of the new govern
ment and a bill will be lntroduced!1en
abllng the members to take their seats
without going through the formality
of a new election which the law de
mands when a member accepts a po
sition under the crown.
The complexion of the new govern
ment is twelve Liberals, fifteen Union
ists, three Laborltes and the presi

have been attached to no parties.

Fargo, X. D., Dec. 11.—*Ifiat the
throo justices-elect may refuse to
recognize the decision of the pro
visional court and will stay at Bis
marck ready to hear cases that may
come up was indicated this after
noon by William Lemke, attorney
for the Justices-elect. They have
refused to recognise the provision
al court and, therefore, probably
will not accept the decision said Mr.
Lemke. Undoubtedly any proceed
ings before the retiring Justices will
be subject to review by the new
court when they finally are given
formal possession of their places on
tho bench.
"As for salary payments," he
said, "we believe the state officials
who handle the pay envelope will
exercise their own discretion in that
matter, and will accept the conten

In fact constitute the supreme court
of North Dakota, rather than the
outgoing Justices and also that the
provisional court waa without Juris
diction.
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 11.—Three
retiring justices of the soprano
court of North Dakota will not, be
replaced by their successors, cboeoi
in the recent election, until the
first Monday in January, under a
decision handed down today by- tho
provisional supreme court, com
posed of district judges.
The justices-elect, J. E. Robinson,
Luther E. Birdzell and H. M. Gn»
contended the state constitution
fixed the first Monday in December
as the time for the new justices
to take their seats, and had de
clared that they had formally
qualified lost Monday.
The retiring justices, Charles J.
Flsk, E. T. Burke and E. B. Goss,
held that an amendment to the con
stitution had eliminated the "first
Monday In December" provision,
thereby making the time.for jus
tices' qualification and assumption
of office the same as for other state
officers, which is the first Monday
in January.
The decision also set aside the
pica of the justices-elect that the
provisional court, made up of four
dittrict court judges, was without
authority to act.
The supreme court tangle has
developed many remarkable fea
tures, the most spectacular of
which was staged at the hearing
last Thursday, when Justice-elect
Robinson openly charged that the
provisional court had been picked
to deride against the justices-elect,
llie provisional court was made up
of District Judges Charles Pollock
of Cass county, C. M. Cooley of
Grand Porks. W. L. Nuessle of
Burleigh, and W. C. Crawford of
Dickinson.
The justices-elect were chosen by
decisive pluralities In the November
7 election. They were endorsed by
the North Dakota Nonpartisan
league.
The court held that the reference
in section ninety-two of the con
stitution to the tenure of office of
Judges of supreme court dating
from the first Monday in Decem
ber, 1880. had reference wholly to
three Judges first elected, that
judges of the supreme court are
state officers and all members
thereof, save the first three, benrln
their terms of office on the first
Monday in Jan nary. The provision
of the court defends its own con
stitutionality by upholding the right
of supreme court justice when dis
qualified to sit to call in district
judges.
