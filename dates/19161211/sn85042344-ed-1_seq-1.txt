pects to arrive Wednesday afternoon.
He declined to discuss I lie protocol

Honor Paul met newspaper men
here in n cordial manner, but. reply
ing to n direct uestiou as to whether

said out of deference to his colleagues
on the Joint commission he must ob
serve silence until he reached his des

climbed into one of the many waiting
automobiles at Ibe station and re
"incited (In l-'rcnehi to bo driven to
the theater where tho ballets were to
bo presented. As Tulsa Is by far the
sn alb st city In which the dancers
will appear on their transcontinental
tour, lie naturally had expected that
the iiccominodat ions ben- would be,
at the very best, rather limited.
Hols l lrsl Surprise.
What was the surprise of M. Nliln-
sky's escort when the noted dancer
gave an ejaculation of euliiline, woii-ib-i
mid delight when he stepped on
the deep stage at Convention hall?
Thru the attending member of the
compi.ny who was serving as inter
preter M. Niiinskv informed those 111
the party that the reason for his
pleasure was tho Convention hall
stage, lie explained that Hie sloping
stage, which Tulsa ns had feared
W( uld be a ra vvluiek to the ballets,
was most desirable. The stage, which
Is about twenty feet deep. Inclines
approximately IS Inches. M. Nlllnsky
expressed great pleasure. He said tho
Hti ges In practically all the h ailing
Hunters of Kuiopo built for ballets

Some ono In tho parly miggostoil
thai SI. Nlllnsky should give "i, good
exhibition" .Monday night with this
advantage.
Always hihmI.
To this, without Ihe slightest ap
pearance of braggadocio or boasting,
SI. Niiinskv replied Willi a smile that
he "always gave good exhibit Ions".
Tills Is not the first time that Sf
Xijinsky has been 111 America, und on
lids tour Ihe company has la-en hero
sine hist January. An Interviewer
expressed surprise that tho dancer did
not e ven pretend to spouk English.
"The truth is, 1 never havo had
time to master the language," be an
swered thru the Interpreter. "It
sums I'm always busy. If It's not
one thing It's another -a massage, a
tide thru the city, or something else.
And there are so many cities"
M. Nljinskv could ho described ns
Just what one would expect as the
world's greatest dancer.
He Is of medium stature. Ills head
Is small and the features are Russian
high cheekbones ami wldoset Slavic
eyes. II Is the face of the Itusslan
aristocrat. Tho hands nro beautiful
and well shaped an I Hie whole body
appears to bo what tlm body of the
premier dancer ought to lie. This
sunshine of the southwest In the midst
of winter is a marvel to him. coming
out of tho colder north and easi.
.Many of the visiting artists dis
played great interest In this section of
Oklahoma because of tho myriad of
oil wells that they saw from the train
windows as their special rolled thru
the Slul-Contlnent field toward Tulsa.
It was the first time that many of
them bad seen such a sight. Not so

Three ballets are to bn presented

Tho performance of tho ballot will

an. I too Intangible for mortal words.
It is a dance that Is not danced on the

of the audience." The other two bal

not hesitated to place himself In the
position more closely resembling a
dictatorship than ho was willing to
give his predecessor.

government leadership In the house
