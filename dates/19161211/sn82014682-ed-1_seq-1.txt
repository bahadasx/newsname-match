migration of male Japanese into the

The attack cause 1 the senate to

j
Vernon Ayau, shortstop of the Chi
nese Travelers' baseball eam, will
play with the Seattle club of the
Northwest League next seanon. Ayau
is the first Chinese ball plajer to be
given an opportunity, to perform in a
league of this strength. "Bill Leard.
who will manage the Seattle club next
year, signed Ayau this morning after
a short conference.'
Vernon Ayau is well known to the
baseball fans of HawaJl, as lie has
starred for a number of years, with
the Chinese team. His great work
with the Chinese Traveler has 'tt
fncted attention thrtniRhout the coun
try and, according to th members of
the All-Amerlcans, la one of the fast
est fielders In the business.
There Is no question about Ayau
making good In the fielding line, as
he will'have It on any of the short
fielders in the Northwest circuit Few
players In the game today can go as
'far to the right and throw runners out.
Without a doubt he will be a real sen
sation in the league. Ho has cam
paigned with the Travelers every day
during the season and this work will
mean much to him. Against the visit
ing pitchers he has hit well and will
-without doubt hold his own in, this
department. Two or three weeks ago
the Star-Bulletin discussed the mat
ter with both Swain and Leard and
both agreed that Ayau .was a smart
ball player, capable of making good in
fast company.
Honolulu has sent Johnny Williams
and Barney Joy to the minor leagues,
and "Lefty" York, who pitched for the
l6t Infantry, will play with Vancouver
next season. Ayau is a popular player
in Honolulu and --will, without doubt
make good with the fans in the North-
. west League. He has good habits.
'- and, furthermore, is always iuicondi
tion. Honolulu will watch with inter
est the work of the popular shortstop
; next season."

GOVERNOR CONFERS
WITIID.E.L1ETZGER
Territorial Senator Delbert E. MeU
ger came to Honolulu from Hilo last
Saturday and has had a conference
with Governor Pinkham, but on the
best authority it can be said that
there have. been no developments in
the secretaryship situation. Metzger
Is not after the vacancy made by W.
W. Thayer's resignatlcn. say his
friends, and It i understood that no
reccramendatlon has been made by
the. governor, Neither is inclined to
discuss the report, which was' given
impetus' when Metzger-returned from
niter nrpi-nn n fpw azo. after
eirts. in the? Northwest and may go
back for a short trip this 'winter,; but
his plans are now to spend the next
few. months-in Hawaii, mostly at his
home in Hilo. He Jjas not given p
rerldence in the territory and does
not intend to. Recently he leased the
Waiakea quarry near Hilo to Richard
Deraing for the American Surety Com-
pany, on the same terms as he had
leased It to Contractor Marshall, for
use in building the Hilo breakwater
extension. , '
".Metz" is. lighter by eight or ten
rounds than when his friends here
last saw him, but he Is a booster for
the Northwest nevertheless. He will
be In Honolulu for several days. Dame
Rumor continues busy with Teports
that after conferences with the gov
ernor there may be developments in
the secretaryship, but the reports are
based on little , knowledge. Another
rumor -is that, he may be connected
with the Hilo breakwater work now
tiken over by the American Surety
Company. Metzger put through suc
cessfully the first contract on this big
joo. Since then successive contract
ors have had disastrous financial ex
lericnces. y
FILIPINO miMi
- FREED OF MURDER
Elena Itojas. a comely Filipino wo
man, walked out of Circuit Judge Ash
fcrd's court this morning free, i She
had been charged with first degree
murder, having shot and killed a Fili
pino 'man 'at. Waipahu, but, at the in
stance of City Attorney Artliur M.
Crown, her case was nolle prossed.
Attorney Rrown. giving the facts of
the case, said he did not feel he could
ever secure a conviction for first de
gre.e murder or any lesser charge. He
explained that everything went to
show tht the woman had shot and
killed the man in defense of her hon
or that the man had entered her
room and attempted to assault her.
Circuit Judge Ashford remarked
I that, while it was unusual to nolle
prosse a first degree murder case, he
had practically advised the city at
torney to take this action, so far as it
was within his power to offer such
advice.1 ' '

To get around this raise, if the bill

That is, to send their magazines by
express in lots equal to the number
of subscribers in the islands and mall
them nere through a local agent to
subscribers in the territory. The
mail order houses are now following
this method in 'sending catalogues to
their island patrons. Mainland news
papers will have to da the same way
to reach their ' subscribers in the isl

respond with the increase in postage.
Onie Subscriber Costs $4.45
The mailing weight of one copy of
the Star-Bullet?n for a year, about
310 issues, wa? today calculated by
this newspaper's circulation depart

At 6c a pound, the proposed rate
called for in the bill, it will cost the
Star-Bulletin ?3.46 to send a mainland
subscriber, a year's issue of the pa
per. It now costs at the present rate
of one cent a pound, 91 cents. The
bill will hit hard all island news
papers having mainland subscribers
as well as mainland newspapers hav

cuit Julge AshTord's court at 9 o'clock
next Wednesliy morning. He is
charged with having murdered Hiroki
Emoto. who was a chaufteur tor James
B. Castle.
The murder of Emoto was one of
the most brutal in local police annals.
Emoto and his wife were found in
bed in their house at the Castle place
at W'aikiki. The man was dead ,as
the result of wounds inflicted with a
knifex or some other sharp Instru
ment nd the woman, also severely
cut, was removed to the hospital in a
serious condition! She recovered.
Emoto, his w!fe, the defendant and
several other Japanese had attended

and it is alleged by the prosecution
that the defendant had a grudge
against the dead man due, it is con
tended, to jealousy. ;. ;":'

' billiugham's ctgnment clung to - the
point that the government by dam

liad been largely responsible for the
present condition of the Walkiki

project when the government "has
turned on the hose.' He emphasized
the need of a ccmplete survey of the
whole aiea which exceeds by 100 per

John Bowler voiced the same feeling

the property owners are paying for."

Governor Pinkham declared toward
the close of the meeting that he saw
no raas'.n- why, with the . territory's
big income and good financial stand
ing, it should not help out largely with
the W.iikikl and other projects.
As the matter now stands it seems
probable that nothing more will be
done under the Unit No. 1 plan, but
that a scheme for the whole will be
drawn up and probably presented at
the legislature two months hence.
Forbes declared after-the meeting that
the plans he has drawn for' a single

LONDON, Eng., Dec. 11. Premier
Lloyd George's statement of the policy
which he, as the new irlme minister
of Britain, will pursue will probably
be made in the house of commons on
Thursday.
The premier has already sent Jet
terJ to the members of the house, de
claring "The predominant task of I the
government is the vigorous prosecu
tion of the war to a triumphant con
clusion. I fiel confident that the
government can rely on your support
so long as it devotes its energies ef
fectively to that end." .
The policy of Premier Lloyd George
will be an aggressive one in regard to
the war, with every ounce of British
energy devoted to as early an attain
ment. of victory as is possible, accord
ing to an article from the pen of Lord
Northcliffe, sent out by him as his
weekly despatch to the news agencies
represented by his string of publications.-
'':-'..-.'
Lloyd-George's program will in
clude the arming of air British mer
chantmen against submarine' attack
and the speeding up of the munition
plants, the recruiting stations, the
training camps, the navy yards and
the supply departments in prepara
tion for the spring offensive.
Every Man Eligible
"The mobilization of all the capable
males of the Kingdom', between the
ages of 16 and GO years, with every
man given a task to perform for the
country, along the lines of the 'Ger
man .Man Power Act, will be undertaken.'-
. r y -.-,'.' .';. .'
"There will be a readjustment of
the German blokade, with : the lines
drawn tighter and the . restrictions
upon neutral trading more strineent.
"Every effort will be made to In
crease the home production of the
food of the nation, lessening the de
pendence upon imports, while all work
not material to the successful out
come or tne war wm dc placed unaer
the ban of the government. Luxuries
will be prohibited and there will be
Instituted ' meatless days," in order to
conserve the available supply and to
liberate more shipping for necessary,
purposes of the war."
