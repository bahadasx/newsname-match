1128.75 IS TO HI. FUND 10 DATE
Miss Lily Tallavou Sails Most Tickets far Benefit. Miss
Bernice Guidry Wins Second Prize.- Benefit Nets
Fund $15. Methodist Sunday School Gives $5.
Christmas is fast approaching and
the Review Doll and Toy Fund is
increasing daily, but not like it
should in a town the Size of Morgan
City and as the time for the King's
Daughters to make the distribution
is not far off, let everybody try and
make it bne grand success. The fund
closes December 16th which only
leaves five days more if you want to
get your name on the list and help a
good cause.
The King's Daughters who are
working hard for this fund report
that the amount received up to date
wont allow them to make a visit to
all of the poor in the city and if
everybody who is in a position to
render a iittle help with a small do-
nation it will enable them to pay a
visit to ali the homes of the poor
when Christmas comes around.
- There is an old saying that money
can't buy happiness but in this case
the old saying is wrong as a little
donation to the Doll and Toy Fund
will bring happiness to a lot of the
poor little folks in Morgan City who
are not expecting much on Christ
mas and why not make them happy
for one day in the year.
Those who have not contributed
to the fund why not make yours to
day as tomorrow you might over
look it and as the fund is stiil not
up to the amount required it would
help wonderfully.
Contributions can be made at the
Peoples State and Saving Bank or
any bank in Morgan City. See that
your name and amount appears cor
rectly in the columns of the Review.
All funds contributed to The Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund-but contributions will be
accepted by the banks of Morgan
City and by a nupiber of the busi
ness'men. Be certain that your name
and the correct amount you contri
bute appear in the colums of this
paper.
