of Mayor Fawcett's food com
mission, appointed two weeks
Ago to investigate the high
cost of living.
The commission made a long
report Monday to the mayor, and
Indicated that it had completed
an exhaustive study of the Taco
ma food markets). It did not at
tempt to give the reason for re
cent tremendous increases In food
prices, but suggested that a fed

nent character could do much to
wards maintaining an equilibrium
in the market prices.

Among the findings of the Ta
coma food commission are the
following:
Meat from ranches in the vicin
ity of Tacoma is belter and selling;
at lower prices than foreign meat, j
Prices are from 2 to 5 cents be-j
low those in Seattle.
Housewives will find as much:
nutriment in the cheaper grades j
of meat as in the better cuts.
The Puget Sound fishing Indus-!
try is meeting with an ever-de-!
creasing supply of fish, and the
better grades are all sent east,:
thus causing a high price In Ta- 1

more popular kinds of fish, house-,
wives may save money by buying!
cod, soles, flounders, herring and
skate.
Buy Flah Direct.
Purchase of fish direct from the I
fishermen, if this could be ar
ranged, would cut the consumer's
«ost more than half.
Retail grocers are exonerated
from blame for the high cost of
foods.
Wholesale buying is urged as be-1
Ing one positive means of cutting:
down the cost of living. Apart-1
int-tii dwellers are handicapped
by a lack of storage space.
Substitute foods are urged.
Rice can he substituted for pota
toes. Carrots and other roots
can be substituted for brussels
sprouts, artichokes and cauliflow
er. Cabbage might take the place
of celery, and squash of sweet
potatoes. Cheese and nuts might
occasionally be used instead of
meat. Cheaper flour, such as the
hard flour of Montana, is just as
nourishing and palatable as the
patent process white flour.
Propose City Store.
For community buying, the
commission suggests the estab
lishment of a downtown store
where potatoes, apples, cabbages,
oranges and other produce might
be handled economically for the
consumer. This would be In the
nature of a municipal grocery
store.
A real public market, where
vegetables, eggs, butter, cheese,
fruits and all ranch products ,
could be sold direct from the j
ranchers' wagons to the house
wives, would be a boon to the
city.

commodities is recommended.

It was somewhat after nine

LAND SHARK MAD!
Ha! Wt have discovered an influential citizen who is opposed to
bringing the army post to Pierce county!
He is very much against the idea!
It is E. F. Gregory, land shark!
Gregory, you may remember, is the individual who made a great
to-do some years ago about the possibilities of irrigating the gravel
prairies.
He actually did irrigate a small tract, after gobbling up a large
acreage at a low price, and on the strength of his showing at raising
garden truck, managed to re-sell at greatly advanced prices to small
investors part of his holdings. Much of what he sold has come back
to him.
He obtained his fine results by manuring the experimental gar
den very heavily. A real estate friend of ours says Gregory could
have made an equally convincing showing had he cultivated a patch of
cement sidewalk, for the secret was in the fertilization and watering,
and not in the richness of the soil.
Gregory more recently made himself famous by advertising in the
newspapers the foolish prophecy that Tacoma land values would
slump fearfully in case Wilson were re-elected. Wilson won', and the
land shark had to acknowledge publicly his bad judgment.
Now he is violently opposed to the coming of the army post. He
says if he were given the two million dollars that he could bring more
settlers onto the land than the army post will bring soldiers.
He is terribly afraid that the condemnation of his holding is going
to shut off a profitable Good Thing. He knows he can't sell any of
his $5 land for $200, as he likes to do.
He is dead against the project.
Verily this is the Year of Promise. With a few E. F. Gregorys
fighting it, the enterprise is sure to win.
Wheeler Finds Church Where

"Take me, then!" exclaimed

It came at the conclusion of a

in which the plajatlff fainted four
times while on the witness stand
attempting to tell the story of

Orr, who is said to lie a wealthy
property owner of Stellacoom, de
nied that he ever had been en-,

promised to marry her, though
he admitted wrongful relations
between them. He said the girl

The prosecutor brought out tes

impossible that with a wound
such as the doctors described,
Mrs. Pierwsza should have walk
ed In behind the stove, as the de
fense claims, or that she should
even have remained on her feet,!
or retained sight or consciousness
after the shot was fired.
The cross-examination was dl-.
rected almost entirely at getting ]
the physicians to admit that while i
highly Improbable, these things '
were not impossible.
Dr. Charles James testified that'
the bullet had passed below and ,
In front of instead of through the '
middle lobe of the brain, and had
shattered the entire structure of i
the left eye, and so Injured the

and loss of consciousness prob

He also said he did not think it

It was learned that after the
case closed late Saturday the Jury
deliberated nearly seven hour*
before an agreement was reached.
There were four women and
eight men on the jury. The di
vision among them, It was learn
ed, was not over the question
whether the Waldron girl was en
titled to damages, hut the amount
of damages which should be

The evidence given by the girl
on the witness Btand was that she
I had given six of the best years ot
her life to Orr, trusting in hla
promises to marry her, only to be

aliout to become a mother.
She declared again and again

Many of her love letters to him

trial, showing that she had trusted
in his promises to her.

her head when fired, said he
thought it must have been held at
some distance.
A portion of the skin from
around the wound which had been
dissected by the physicians waa
brought into court by the prose
cutor.
Dr. James testified that he
doubted it much blood had spurt
ed from the wound, but admitted
there might have been a hemor

that if the woman committed sui
cide, she would probably have
dosed her eyes Just before firing
the shot, In which case there
would have been laceration of
the eyelid; but that no such lacer
