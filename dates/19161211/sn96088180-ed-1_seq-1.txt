will actually form a war council of
five members, exactly similar to
Lloyd-George's compact board of
directors for the war.

London, Dec. U.-rThe energising

For the first time since August

While the German press Is refer

development as democracy's great
est triumphs of the century.
Moreover, It Is apparent that
Lloyd-George Is no man's man, but
his own. Charges of newspapers
antagonistic to the Welshman, that
he was the mere tool of Lord North'
cliffe, heve been effectually diss!'
pated by Lloyd-George's choice of
two men in his ministry who have
been particularly under the fire of
the Northcllffe newspapers Arthur

In the rise of Lloyd -George to the

claim, repeatedly made since Aug

its divided authority cannot cope
with the efficiency and the force of

Chicago, where he will assume per

to prove "vicious collusion" ot food

that a number of prominent finan

Berlin, via Sayrille, Dec 11. De
tense of deportation of Belgian work
men was made by the German gov
ernment today in a special state
ment issued by the press bureau,
which also announced receipt and
"declination" of the Belgian , pro
test against such transfers. Germsny
holds ber actions in Belgium are jus-'
tilled by that part of The Hague in
ternational law regulations requiring
a power occupying an Invaded na
tion to maintain order and permit
ting "additional orders" to this end.
The statement follows:'
"The Swiss minister at Berlin: in
conversation with the ehancelor, no--titled
bit that rumors of trouble in
transportation of Belgian workmen,
had Impressed the Swiss population..
Therefore the Information was given
the Swiss government about the facts'
and 'legal aspects of the esse,' notice
also being' gives that the governor-,
gwierst': t'rtiswl--buid " respect
neutral Swiss interests In carrying
out the measures.
"The Belgian government through
the Spanish embassy in Berlin, which
is charged' with representation ot
Belgian interests, protested agsinst
the transportation of . Belgian work
men to Germany and their employ
ment in work. - The protest was de
clined as announced. The order ot
the governor general at Brussels
May 15 last punishes with prison con
finement or forced employment, per
sons who enjoyed public charity and
nevertheless refuse to accept or con
tinue work corresponding to ' their
abibties. '."' .
"This is by no means contrary to
International law, since paragraph
43 of The Hague land war orders
obliges an occupying power to main
tain public order and It the conn-'
try's laws are insufficient for this
purpose, to issue additional orders.'
His public order without doubt Im
plies that able bodied persons as
far as possible do not impose them
selves on public charity. Since work
is scarce In Belgium, a large number
of Belgian workmen have voluntarily
applied for It In Germany. . Others ,
were naturally treated, according to
the quoted order of the governor gen
eral. i' . X
' "No scenes of terror occurred d'ur-' .
ing the transport of workmen, which
was accomplished without harshness
and with all possible consideration.
