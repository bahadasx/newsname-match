I Br Associated Pkm.)
RERUN (wireless to Sayville), Dec. 11. The Rumanians have
lost approximately 112,000 men in prisoners since Rumania entered
the war, or about one-sixth of their army, besides suffering casualties
estimated at about 300,000, writes the military critic of the Overseas
News agency. ' '
The Teutonic, victory has made possible the shortening of the
front by about .'140 miles, continues the critic.
The -German - losses are . declared to have beeu , astonishingly
small. One army corps which made 80(H) prisoners and besides is
.calculated to have been accountable for C(HH) casualties in the
.opposing ranks, has itself considerably less than KXH) casualties,
writes the military correspondent, who also instances the instance
of the capture by the Teutonic forces during the past week of
Dearly 30,000 men in prisoners besides immense quantities of cannon,
machine guns, material and supplies.
The great Russian offensive on the north pressed in force and at
a cost of great sacrifices in an effort to save portions of the northern
Rumanian army, is declared to have been altogether in vain.
