MADE AN ISSUE
Believed England Will Force
U.S. to Take Definite Stand
in Near Future.
Acepting Lord Northcliffea s)atemt
a: true that Great Britain isend, to arm
al merchantmen flying the British lag,
e4cials here last night interpreted it as
an indication that the United States would
have 'to form a clear and poey
toward submarine warfare. The armed
ship controversy with Greal Britain. it
was pointed out, never was sharply re
solved, the State Department merely
stating that it would deal with each came
as it aroue on the ftets presented.
While ocials declined to be quoted, It
was learned from admInistration sources
that the attitude of the State Depart
ment still i that bona fide merchant
men can carry guns intended for delen
seve purposes up to six-inch calibers, and
that the gun be mounted at the stern.
The moot perplexing angle ,of the situa
tion is that a gun of such power can
destroy a submarine with a dagle shot.
instead of merely standing it off In an
attempt to escape.
Attitude of Ges-may.
This fact alone, the German govern
ment,claims, is sufficient to remove any
ship so armed from the class of mer
chantmen. and make it a war vessel.
in addition, the British government has
claimed that the nature of submarine
warfare makes it necessary for defen
sive guns to be placed forward.
London never has been matimfied with
the attitude taken by the United States
toward the destruction of merchant ves
sels by German submarines, and evident
ly intends by arming all British merchant
. vessels to force the American govern
ment to set a precedent by ruling oM
etally on the question of defensive arma
ment for merchant vessels.
This will be a hard matter, according
to State Department officials who could
he reached last night. The administra
tion. it Is understood. Intends to take into
consideration in every case that arises
out of clashes between armed merchant
men and submarines these considera
tion:
Questieas te Be ConsIdesaed.
The power of the gun.
Its position on the vessel.
.The bona fides of the vessel's non
belligerent character.
Germany. oficials here confidently be
lieve. will lodge a protest or a series of
protests against permitting armed vessels
to leave American ports, when their
armament does not coincide with the
German view of defensive armament.
Counting on such action by its enemy, it
is believed here. the London government
expects to force a definite ruling on the
position and size of guns that freight and
passenger vessels may carry and remain
with the nonwarphip clams.
Ruch a ruling cannot be acceptable to
both Germany and !ngland, it was
pointed out last night, and regardless of
its nature, a long diplomatic controversy
between the United States and one or the
other of the warring nations is expected.
Fp MARSHA oYAMA,
JAP ARMY HERO, DEAD
Won Laurels in Land Campaign Con
ducted Against Russians.
4 By the Internetieal Newe Ses! ei,)
Tokyo. Dec. 10.-The Marquis Iwao Oy
ama. field mar I general, who directed
the Japanese la campaign In the Russo
Japanese war, is dead.
The Marquis Iwao Oyama was one of
Japan's greatest soldiers. Qualified Ger
man military critics have compared him
tI the great Moltke and some even to Na
. oleon. British war writers have likened
him to Kitchener. In his long and fame
lined career his victories over the Rus
sMans in Manchuria during the Russo
Japanese war stand out as most bril
liant achievements. He was the master
mind of Japan's strategy in the land
campaign. His chain of victories was
crowned by the success In the battle of
Llao. In the war with China he led the
second Japanese army which took Port
Arthur and Wei-Hal-Wel.
To the American public Marshad Oyana
has long been a familiar figure, because
of the fact that his wife was one of the
first Japanese girls to be educated In
America. The marchioness, at the age of
10, was chosen as the cleverest among a
thousand little girls, and sent by the
Japanese government to the United
States in 1371. She lived several years
in New Haven, Conn.. and later went to
Vassar. graduating with the highest hon
ers.

by King Fej'inand's northerdarmy. Tii
claim was made by the Russian war of
ace today. Rallying on the road which
leads from Ploesci to Buzeu, one of the
raitway keys to Moldavia, the Rumanians
turned on the pursuing Teutons and drove
them 'back beyond the Grikovus River.
some twenty-six miles from Buseu.
The Russian claim conflicts with Ber
lin's regular daily war bulletin which
states the Teuton advance in Eastern
Wallachia continues. A supplementary
statement tonight says:
"In great Wallachia. in spite of rainy
weather, rapid progress Is being made."
Meanwhile the Russians themselves
scored successes In the northern ridges
of the Transylvanian Alps. A successful
general offensive Is indicated by the Pet
rograd announcement that the Muscovite
advance continues in the Trotus, Nulty
and Chedonisha valleys. The German
war office admits the loss of a height in
the Trotus Valley.
While these are the features of the
actual fighting of the last thirty-six
hours, a development which by far over
shadows them In importance because of
its probable consequences Is this piece of
news officially told in the German after
noon report:
"Between Cernawoda and Silistria,
Bulgarian forces cmosed the Danube."

against Rumania and the opening blow
in what is gradually shaping itself into
a campaign against Bessarabia and the
entire Russian southern battle front.
