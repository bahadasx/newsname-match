A Good Thing
For Maysville
Our Christmas Money Club
Record For 1916
Fifteen hundred members.
Total deposits and to be paid out over $36,000.
Seventy thousand weekly deposits received.
Smallest single weekly deposit one cent.
Largest single weekly deposit $2.50.
If paid in pennies it would take 3 500,000 pennies.
Those pennies would weigh 25,000 pounds, and if put side by
side would reach forty miles.
If paid in silver dollars they would weigh one ton.
If paid in one dollar bills they would reach over four and one
half miles if placed end to end.
The amount saved in 50 weeks would keep 65 families one year.
It would buy 600,000 loaves of bread.
It takes a well equipped bank to do these things, not to mention
investing in loans and investments that can be realized
on when desired, and paying out such a large sum of
money without any perceptible effort
If this club benefits you and if you think it is a good thing for
Maysville, we will be glad to have you show your ap
preciation by opening a bank account in either or both
of our commercial and savings departments.
