after lio returned to the depths
i . of the mine the first of the explosions |
, which cost all told eleven human lives i
and property damage to the amount of:
at least half a million dollars began.
This much developed today when,
Ihe inquest into the disaster was re-i
sullied at the mine. Undertaker Cun-I
iiingluim and Dudley Miller, an employee
of the Cunningham establish- j
inent. both testified that they found j
matches and cigarettes 011 the body of
Frank Higginboiliam and Undertaker ;
Jones losiiueu to a similar condition !
ol things with regard to Vance, two 01 ,
the victims. i
It was stated earlier in tile day that j
testimony regarding the way in which
,i the men got the matches would bo in- j
traduced before today's sossiou o? the I
inquest is adjourned.
The hearing was resumed this morn- j
? ing at tile office at the mine at 9 ;
2 o'clock in accordance with the ar-1
langcments when it was adjourned iast |
i week.
tt - . Chief Engineer K. Cowan was the 11
first one called today, it being the |
second time he was on the stand dur-j
ing the inquest, lie testified that'
upon his entrance into the mine the !
day of the explosion, after the dam- j
age had been done, he noticed that,
live of the six motors used in the mine :
were on the regular motor track while !
the sixth was in section South A, hav-j
x . ing evidently been moved there by
' /' Chapman, it is, Mr. Cowan said, possible
tlint Chapman left tile motor in
oouih A and tiieu walked to me shaft
where he was found after the explo,.
sion. None of the cars was in any ]
place where gas ignition was possible.
That there would be no occasion for j
thinking that the disaster was caused
by electric sparks was proved when
John H. Hugnes, engtner in charge of
the power house, stated that he had
shut the electricity oil the mine several
minutes before ho heard what
Bounded to him "liko a dynamite explosion."
he then turned and "saw a
cloud of lilacs soot coming from Coulomb
ot the shalt, and I knew what i
it was." Ho testified there had been
no short circuits during the day nor ;
no disturbance on his auimetre.
/ John Molloy, assistant superintendent
at the mine, was called following
Mr. Cowan, lie stated he went in and
inspected I lie mine at about 7 ti. m.
tile uav of tile e.MduMun alld look witii
Iiim two men who wished to work that !
;iuy. Ho did not know wliy nor how 1
Vincent and Foster went into the mine I
ind did not give tlicui permission.
G. A. Wetzel, lampman on day turn
it the niiue, told the jury that he had ;
glvon Vincent and Foster their lamps :
because "Vincent told me he had seen
Molloy and got permission to enter :
tho mine." He said he knew Vincent j
as being a regular worker and did not
jk > iigure he wus taking any chances and
us far as violating the law was concerned.
Vincent offered an identification
check, his regular lamp check
having been either misplaced or lost
the day previous. Molloy denied that
ho and Vincent had any conversation
tlio morning of the 19th.
: ( J. J. Mcluerney, night lamp man,
stntcd that he gave Matt Allison and
John Fagun lamps to enter the mine
the morning of the day of the accident.
It was one of the duties of the
lamp men to see that every man who 1
entered the mine besides having an 1
nlectric light should be provided with
a snfety lamp These lumps arc so
' constructed that gas in the mine can
be detected without injuring those
carrying them
11. E. Stevens, hoisting engineer,
f 1 stated that he let down into the mine
10 men on the morning of October 19.
John M. Haynes, night foreman, testified
that on the morning of October
17 at two o'clock, lie detected gas in
the north section. 'This he "dangerod
off" by putting up a brattice and put- j
ting on a sign "Danger?Gas."
Robert Russell and W. I>. Bridges,
cutter and contractor respectively,
corroborated previous evidence that
the mine was known to liberate gas
[P but each stated that, ill no ease where
they had had to use electric cutters
had there ever been any gas ignitions.
They informed the jury that they him
U* often encountered gas. as witnesses
before them had testified, but that as

discovered It was remedied and regie

West Virginia Senator Has i
No Intention of Relinquishing
Post.
(Special DlupaluJi to Went Virginian)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dee. 11.?
Twice selnce the elect inn It litis honn
printed In newspapers in West Virgin- k
ta that Senator Nathan Goff was on
the point ot resigning, the second story
going so far as to state that it was
"rumored" that the resignation had
been received by Gorvernor Hatfield.
These reports originated in this city
and signillcamly appeared originally t
in partisan Democratic newspapers, j
Senator Goff issued a direct denial
to the lirst publication, and Governor
Hatlleld's office has issued a denial
or the second in so far as it relat
ed to a resignation being received by
hint from Senator Goff. Senator Goff's |
secretary. E. 11. McDermott, has denied
the second report, of it resignation.
Senator Goff. who has been here
since the convening of congress will
not take the trouble to issue any
more denials that has any intention ,
of giving up his seat lit the i'tiited
Statos Senate, ills intimate friends
know that he has no idea of quitting
his office before his term expires.
The persistent publication of these;
reports has led to belief that they
are inspired, and their origin leads
to the further belief that they are inspired
by Democratic politicians. .Inst
what the motive is behind its political
observers hero are unable to state.,
but the chief guess made is that it
Is a desire to annoy Senator Goff. who
i-i and lias been in ill health for several
years, in the hope that he tnighl
resign. If that could he brought about,
it would at once throw West Virginia
uitu i in* uiiuni wi iiiiuuit'i niair-w iui;
campaign to elect liis successor for
the balance of his term.
Tile supposition held is that with
the sentiment of tiie country and in
West Virginia particularly shown to
have hcon strongly Democratic at the
recent election, with the backings of
the Federal government and its pat
ronage, with the additional help o"
promises nf offices front Governor
elect Cornwall, and other conditions
which seem to them to he: most favorable
to success, tins Demoeratic party
in nation and state might lie able
to gain a member of the Senate from |
West Virginia. That in general terms j
appears to the stae's politicians here to j
be behind litis underhanded, anonymous
and insinuating attack upon Senator
Goff.
If this view taken of it is in a gen- 0
ernl way correct, there isn't the re- S
motest likelihood of the partisan Dent e
ocratic scheme prevailing. If at any 1t!
time during ills term of office. Sena j t!
tor Goff entertained the thought of re- s
signing from the Senate on account of tl
the condition of his health, which
close friends know from Ills own lips
