DON-DON. Dec. 11.?Premier Lloyd-:
George is ill. He was unable to go
to Buckingham palace Monday with j
members of his cabinet to receive the]
seals of office from King George.
Official announcement was made that:
the premier was suffering from a severe
cold.
Andrew Bonar Law and the other
members of the ministry, who are not
required to seek re-election on as-;
sumption of office, and also the lords
who are co-opcrating with the new;
administration went to the palace at
noon "Monday, kissed the hands of the
king and received their seals of office, j
The members of the cabinet, who
must be re-elected unless the House
of Commons passes a bill making this
unnecessary, and the ministers who
are members of neither house, for
whom seats must be found, are taking
over their offices and will conduct them
as though all official formalities had
been complied with. These members,
however, will not be able to appear
before the House of Commons Tuesday
and it is expected the session will be
a formal one.
The statement concerning the government's
policy to be made by Mr.
Lolyd-George or Mr. Bonar Law in the

Premier Uoyd-Oeorge has sent the
following to all members of the House
of Commons:
"The king has entrusted me with the
task of forming a government. I have
carried out the command. I had hoped
to make a statement to the House on
Tuesday. I now find it to be Impossible.
On Tuesday Mr. Bonar Law,
as leader in the House, will move adjournment
until Thursday.
"The one predominant task before the
government is the vigorous prosecu- j
tion of the war to a triumphant conclusion.
I feel confident the govern-J
meat can rely on your support as long
as it devotes its energies to that end."

at Its session here Monday.
| "The present system," says the report,
"insures the evangelist an income

of religious effort, and
gives an altogether hurtful prominence
to the commercial side of
evangelism."

a long automobile chase Monday
James Reed was being held by the fed
eral authorities here in' connection
with the explosion Sunday night at
the Fort Pitt plant of the Aetna Chemical
Company, which cost the lives of
three men. Meantime fe'deral agents
were hunting for three otaer men,
who, they say. are suspected of having
been concerned in explosions in other
parts of the country and more directly
with the explosion at the Oakdale plant
of the Aetna company, September lo,
when Ave men were killed.
Reed had as his working companion
in the Aetna plant a federal agent who
had been watching him since early
in the afternoon when, it is alleged,
Reed tried to gain admission to the
Port Pitt plant. Reed, was employed
in the Oakdale plant.
' Samuel C. Jamison, coroner of Allegheny
county, after visiting the ruins
of Sunday night's explosion expressed
the belief that the building had been
blown up by a bomb.
Federal agents who had been investigating
explosions in chemical and
munitions plants throughout western
Pennsylvania were looking into a report
among the workmen that ten minutes
before the explosions at Oakdale
and the Fort Pitt plant every light in
the plant was extinguished for fully a
minute. The men said they believca
this was the signal for confederates'
of the plotters to leave the works.
Reed, who was being held at Central
police station, was said by the
government authorities to have resided
in New York, from which place he
went last summer to Uniontown. Pa.,
where there were a number of explosions
in powder factories, and from
there he. went to Oakdale.
