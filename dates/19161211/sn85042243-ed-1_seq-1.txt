"Carried to its logical conclusion,
their contention would bring us into
that singularly unfortunate state of
confusion where one body of men in
office claimed the right to sit and an­
other, not having possession, assert­
ed the same right. The matter would
then have to be determined by purely
the right of possession or a recourse
to physical force, where the members
of the highest judicial branch of the
government must settle the disputed
question by the arbitrament of arms
Such a humiliating spectacle in civil
ized society ought not to exist," is the
finding of the provisional supreme
court of North Dakota in disagreeing
with the judges-elect in their conten­
tion that there is no tribunal in the
state which can settle the disputed
question as to the tenure of office of
jusice of the supreme court, and in
holding that the retiring members of
that tribunal shall serve until the first
of January and that the justices^elect
shall take office January 1, 1917.'
It a Supreme Court.
"This court as now constituted is as
much the' supreme court of the state
of North Dakota as though the mem­
bers thereof had been elected to that
position by the people themselves, for
the simple reason that the people in
adopting the constitution said that the
tribunal as now created should be or­
ganized in the form in which-It is, in
cases where the elected and acting
supreme court judges were disquali­
fied," reads the opinion of the provi­
sional court.
Only One Question Involved.
"Upon the whole record, therefore,
the sole and only question remaining
for decision is whether the term of
office of the judges-elect commences
the first Monday in December1, 1916,
or the first Monday* in January, 1917."
The court's findiifgs are:
District judges, when called by
members of supreme court, upon re­
porting for duty are clothed, by the
constitution with all the powers of
justices of the supreme court, to the
same extent as though tliey had been
regularly elected and qualified to fill
such positions.
Territorial enactments were by the
constitution carried forward and be­
came the law of the state. of North
Dakota. The constitution was adopt­
ed in view of a general statute of tlu
territory, which by its terms fixed tha
date of the commencement of the
terms of all state officers upon the
first Monday in January, succeeding
their election.
Section 02 -Defined.
The reference in
sertion
92
of
the
Constitution to the tenure of office of
the judges of the supreme court, and
their holding such offices-, from the
first Monday in December, 1889, had
reference wholly to the three judges
first elected.
Judges of the supreme court are
state officers, and all the members
thereof, save the first three, begin
their terms of office on the first Mon­
day in January following their elec­
tion, under Sectioiui578, compiled laws
of 1913.
Precedent Establishes Rule.
The construction of the constitution
an here declared, while never an­
nounced in a contested case, has for
24 year® been followed by the judges
of the supreme court in entering up­
on the discharge of the duties of their
respective offices. This uniform rule
of action, acquiesced |n without a
single exception for so long a period,
constitutes a practical construction
of the constitution which cannot now
be avoided.
Certificates Immaterial.
The court takes judicial notice of
the fact that judges-elect, Robinson,
Grace and Birdzell were elected and
will be entitled to take their seats on
the first Monday in January, 1917. The
fact whether or not a certificate of
election has been, issued to them, is
therefore immaterial. However, if is­
sued, no administrative officer has
power, by giving a certificate to that
effect, to cjyise a term of office to be­
gin prior to the time when so provid­
ed by the ^ons'titurfon.
Rnpecta to Robinson.
The provisional court pays its re­
spects to Justice-elect Robinson in
the following paragraph:
"During the course of the argument
herein, James E. Robinson, one of the
judges-elect,. threatened that upon tak­
ing their seats the judges-elect would
put aside and render nugatory the
acts of this court as now constituted,
as well as those of the court wherein
Judge Fisk, Goss and Burke have tak­
en part since December 4. Such an
unheard-of proceeding probably never
before occurred in a court of justice,
and we cannot bring ourselves to be­
lieve that the remaining justices
elect will support any such revolution­
ary action. Such threat, however,
ought not to deter this tribunal from
performing its duty. Without our

Secretary of Minneapolis Civic
and Commerce Association
Here Friday
Howard Strong, secretary of the
Minneapolis Civic ft Commerce asso­
ciation, will be tl}e principalVind only
speaker at the annual luncheon and
election of officers of the Bismarck
Commercial club, to be held at the
Hotel McKenzie on Friday noon. Defi­
nite announcement of the date was de­
ferred until Saturday night, when a
wire was received from Mr. Strong
ad vising^ of his ability to be here Fri­
day.
It is anticipated that in the neigh­
borhood of 250 covers will be laid, and
it is hoped to make the luncheon as
successful as the one which marked
the visit of Edward F. Trefz, field
secretary of the United States cham­
ber of commerce, a year ago.
Represents Great Organization,
Howard Strong is the executive and
general manager of the greatest or
gaization of its kind in America and
perhaps in the worlu. No commercial
club or chamber of commerce has so
well fulfilled its mission as has the
Minneapolis Civic & Commerce asso­
ciation, and much that this organiza­
tion has done has been due to the
wise leadership and capable general­
ship of Mr. Strong.
The Minneapolis secretary is a
forceful convincing speaker. His talk
Friday will be short and to the point.
Luncheon will be served promptly
the election of directors for the ensu­
ing year will be held while the cours­
es are being served, and the meeting
from first to last is expected to con­
sume not more than an hour and a
half. Invitations are attended to
every Commercial £lub member, as
there is a large amount of construc­
tive work in view for the club during
the ensuing year, and much depends
upon the choice of directors to suc­
ceed the present board, which has
served successfully during the past
two years and which feels that it is
entitled to retire on its honors*
President's Report.
The only talk to be given Friday
aside from Howard Strong's practical,
pithy address, will be a brief state­
ment of the situation of the club by
President C. L. Young. The secre­
tary's and treasurer's reports will be!
printed, to be digested at leisure. The
only price of admission will be the
cost of the luncheon. There will be
no extras.

(Editor'sNote: This is anoth­
er in a series of stories by Cor­
respondent Burton, in which he
is trying to find out the reasons
for the present skyrocketing of
meat prices, and what remedies
there are for this,, if any. This
article, and those following, take
up and expos* the meat situation
in the United States more thor­
oughly and accurately than it has
been done before.)
By H. P. BURTON.
Chicago, Dec. 11.—One obvious fact
soon emerges from the clouding mass
of detail that intrigues any impartial
study of the problem of how the Unit­
ed States is to g$t cheaper meat, .and
that
CLUfrSJNNUAL
is this:
That we must jfroduce more ani­
mals from which this jneat is to be
derived. For as a statement of plain
fact, it should be understood at once
that while we have been increasing
in population, .the number of cattle
we raise has been dwindling—exact­
ly the reverse of what should have
been happening.
Supply Compared.
In 1896 we had 32,000,000 beef cat­
tle.
In 1907 we had 51,000,000 beef cat­
tle.
In 1915 we had 37,000,000 beef cat­
tle,
These figures represent strategic
points in the curve of our cattle pro
gductioji, which ..exhibits a steady rise
from .lg#ft to 1907, and from then on
betrays what amounts to a steady low­
ering, although during this entire pe­
riod our population has been growing
by leaps and bounds The "sheep
curve" is likewise unto it:
In -1896 we had 88,000,000 sheep.
In 1910 we had 57,000,000 sheep.
In 1915 wc had 49,000,000 sheep.
Shrinkage.
This illustrates the same tendency
to shrinkage in production of sheep
as is shown in the instance of cattle
in the case of swine alone an upward
trend is visible, the number of swine
that were available in 1896 being 42,
000,000 and the number in 1915 hav­
ing risen to 64 millions. (But it is to
be remembered that swine take only
eight months to mature for market
and are therefore more easily sub­
jected to current economic conditions.
An ample confidence in the future
must enter largely in to the business
equipment of the producer of the
more slowly maturing beef and
sheep: else he will probably see fit to
narrow his scale of production until
it comes practicallv to a point of futil­
ity.
The serious shrinkage in the num­
bers of major animals is further
shown in an official government ani­
mal census:
Big Decline.
On January 1, 1907, the number of
cattle and milch cows ori United
States farms was 72,533,996.
On January 1, 1912, the number had
declined to 57,959,000.
This represents a loss of 15,000,000
or twenty per cent in five years!
"And while this loss was taking
place," declares the bulletin, "it must
be borne in mind that in the last ten
years the population has increased by
15,000,000—a gain of 21 per cent. In
other words, two cattle were lost in
those ten years for every man, wo­
man and child gained!
What are the causes of the falling
off in the production of cattle when
practically every other business in
the United States seems to be grow­
ing at a rate unsurpassed in the
world's history?
This question is leading, and brings
us at once to the very bottom, to the
foundation, of the pyramid that, sup­
ports the business of the great meat
packers of the United States—the
Swifts, Armours, Morrises and Cuda
hys— who pile up their millions of
dollars every year from the business
of killing and dressing meats for the
people of this and other countries.

Paris, Dec. 11.—It appeared cer

Briand will reorganize the
French cabinet along the lines of
re-construction that Lloyd-George
adopted.
London, Dec. 11—Lloyd-George,
working day and night, has been suc­
cessful in organizing a cabinet. A
small body to be known as a war min­
istry will have charge of the conduct
of the European struggle. This body
is to be composed of the following:
David Lloyd-George, Lord Milno,
Earl Curzon, Bonar Law and Arthur
Hendeison.
Others ordinarily termed cabinet
minivers will be termed department­
al heads. These consist of twelve lib
orals, fifteen unionists, three labora­
tories and three others, president of
board of Irenes, education, shipping
controller, are not attached to any
party.
Members of the ministry not in the
war council are:
The Members.

Bannatynee Finly secretary of state
for home department, Sir George
Cave secretary of state for foreign
affairs,' Arthur J. Balfour secretary
of state for colonists, Walter Hume

Premier Lloyd-Ceorge has suffered
a severe chill and physicians have
ordered him to remain indoors.
The energizing touch of Lloyd
George has electrifified the British na­
tion. While the new war director was
forced to bed with a chill, London is
in a fever of excitement over the new
order of things.
England's every resource is to be
turned into conduct of way. Every
luxury will be cut off. Nothing could
be clearer than this decisions in the
public belief, after the announcement
that David
