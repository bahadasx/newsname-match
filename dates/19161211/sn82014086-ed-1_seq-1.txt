Paris. Dec. 10. 4.00 p. m. Raoul Pe-
ret, former minister of commerce, dis
cussing in the chamber of deputies

out that France will have incurred
expenditures to the amount of 72,600,-
000,000 francs between -the opening
of hostilities and the end of March
next, while Great Britain in the same
period will have had an outlay of 90,
000.000,000 francs.
This statement drew exclamations
from the deputies to the effect that
X3reat Britain is thus proved to have
collaborated cordially and . complete
ly." The resources M. Peret .puts against
the expenditures made and author
ized amount approximately to 64.000,
000,000 francs as follows: 10.200,000,
000 tax receipts: 38,700,000,000 short

geria., This leaves an apparent de
ficit of 8.000,000.000 francs.
M. Peret said this does not repre

authorized outlay and that of the ap
propriations for 1914 included in the
total 700,000,000 was annulled. He
added that the cancellations for 191."
would be proportionately large and
before the total remaining net amount
Was due several months would elapse.
