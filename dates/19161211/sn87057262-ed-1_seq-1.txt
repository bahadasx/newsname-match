their duties in the two houses, the

a permanent membership of three
men—and two of these, Mliner and
Henderson, are without other tasks
than .that of members of the war

Lloyd-George.
Thus the government forces are
aligned for efficiency.

that Lloyd-George's regime will in

restrictions on beer and wine. Fur

al growth of urban population, es
pecially through migration from rur
al districts cityward is one of the
most "fruitful causes" of the high
cost of living, according to Joseph B1
Ransdall, who addressed the opening
sessions of the southern commercial

Ransdefl said emigration of farm

"The increasing drift of population
from the country to the city in the
United States should cause very ser
ious thought," said Jtonsdell. In
1880, 70.6 per cent of the population
of the United States lived in rural
comm-unities,
in 1900 only 17.8 per
cent lived in communities. Between
1900 and 1910, the urban population
increased 11,013,738 or 34.8 per ceixt,
while the rural population increased
4,fr63,9«3, or 11.2 per cent. In six
states. New Hajwpshife, Vermont,
Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri,
there was an actual decrease In rural
population, and the New England
states as a whole showed a decrease.
It is a very Interesting fact not
generally known that the sooth is a
mighty balance wheel for the nation.
As stated only 63.7 per cent of the
population are rural dwellers. This
is especially the average in the west.
iBut in the north and east the per
cent is only 41 per oent. "If it' were
not for the south with its 77 per cent
of country people, the overage for
the nation would be greatly changed
and prices might now he even high
er than they are.
"It is well worthy of noting that
the south's actual rural increase in
the last decade was much greater
than the urban and In this vast, fer
tile southern region, with its large
numbers of flood producers lies the
nation's strongest hope for solving
the high, cost of living."
