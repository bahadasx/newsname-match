BOARD'S RECENT
RULING SUBJECT
BEFORE BANKERS
Meeting Open Today; Rewards
May Be Increased.
The new ruling of the state banking
beard, which requires state banks to
carry SO percent of theit legal reserve
fund in state banks having a capital
stock of $.S0(KK) or more, overshad
owed everything else in interest among
members of the State Hanker' associa
tion arriving in Oklahoma City this
morning for the annual meeting of the
association which begins tonight.
May Take Action.
Bv some members of the asoc,iation
it is considred quite likely that an ef
fort will be made to put the association
on record in favor of the repeal of the
rule or amending it so as to remove
some of the objections made to it.
The fight against the rule was orig
inally started bv national bankers. It
is said state bankers have joined hands
with national bankers in fighting the
rule
There are only twelve or fifteen state
banks in Oklahoma which have a capi
tal stock of $50,000 or more, and un
der the ruling of the state hanking
hoard they woujd not he permitted to
carry reserve funds.
Anti-Usury Law Up.
The anti-usury law passed a year ag i
is attracting comparatively little in
terest, it is said by those in close touch
with the bankers. They will not ask
for the repeal of the law, but will ask
that it be amended so as to be less
drastic in its operation.
A committee will be selected by the
bankers to prepare bill embodying
new legislation which will be asked bv
bankers. This will include repeal of
he law which now prohibit state
bank from becoming member's of the
federal reserve banking system and pro
vide a standing reward of $1,110 for
the apprehension of bank robbers,
which will work automatically without
a proclamation bv the governor.
