to Prepare the Plans
Two important announcements were
made by the Harrisburg Hotel Com
pany to-day—one that the new mil
lion-dollar Penn-Harris Hotel to be
erected at Third and Walnut streets
will be managed by the United Hotels
Company of New York and that W.
L. Stoddart of New York City and
Esenwein Johnson ol' Buffalo, N. Y.,
will collaborate in the architectural
and engineering work. These archi
tects have had large experience in the
erection of hotels and the design and
detail plans will be worked out in
harmony with the ideas ot the Har
risburg Hotel Company and the
chosen management. Much gratifica
tion was expressed to-day when it was
announced that the lease with the
United Hotels Company had been
executed and was 111 the hands ot the
local Interests. It is now expected
that work can be started on the new
hotel early in the new year.
Experienced Operators
The announcement of the leasing of
the new hotel is the most significant
event that has taken place since the
hotel company was organized. The
directors of the Penn-Harris believe
that they have leased the new hotel
to the ablest and most experienced
hotel operators in the countrv. No
hotel In Pennsylvania, except, perhaps
the Bellevue-Stratford, will be as well

BREAKING IN SOME MUSTANGS FOR GOVERNOR'S TROOP
~~ ~~ " ~~ ~ ~~~~ /"I
Just glance at these etchings and you can realize in a modest way perhaps, how exciting the life of a member of the Governor's Troop that was
—Troop C, Pennsylvania division of the United States National Guard that is—suddenly develops when a fresh mount is needed for some luckless
trooper. The views were snapped bp W. H. Peters, a son of Assistant City Engineer Joseph Peters, who is a member of the Troop's horse guard at
El Paso. The group of stalwart troopers is the horse guard. Reading fromleft to right the troopers are: Sergeant W. H. Wyble, Saddler N. W.
Moyer, Horseshoers F. E. Weber and W. G. Cunningham, and Orderlies \V. H. Peters and C. M. Peters.

Only Ten New Jitneys
Since Amendment Passed
Only ten more jitney operators have
I taken out licenses since the new jitney
I amendments became effective making
! a total of thirty-six which are now
j running daily.
Chief of Police Wetzel said to-day
j that he believes the reason that more
i jitney men are not applying is because
| of the ruling made by the public serv
! ice commission that jitney operators
i must have not only a city license but
a State certificate.
Other applications have been re
j ceived according to Chief Wetzel but
' fo far the operators have not return
j ed to complete arrangements and the
j city police official said that ho does
j not expect a large increase in the
i number of jitneys.

WEEKLY PAPERS' PRICE UP
High Cost of Material Hits Country
Publishers, Too
| Woodbury, N. J., Dec. 11. South
Jersey weekly newspapers, whose
price for a year's subscription ranges
| from $1 to- $2, have begun to feel the
| high price of paper and printing mate-
I rial and are tacking on from twenty
live to fifty cents to rates. Like the
metropolitan dailies, the subscription
price does not pay for the real cost of
the paper.
In most of the country offices job
printing is done, and materials in all
j these branches have increased so that
iit has been necessary to raise the
| price of this kind of work. Help in
| the average country printing office is
just as scarce as on the farm and in
! other businesses, but the average own
-1 er-editor plods along at the "case," the
| press and at his desk about eighteen
I hours of the twenty-four, and dreams
j his editorials for the week "between
i the sheets."

master artist,a Southern negro, helped
keep up the of the "Bucket
of Blood," a negro apartment house,
1219 North Seventh street, when Wal
ter Adams had his throat cut from ear
to ear here Saturday night.
Adams and his wife have rooms at

few friendly callers when several un
desirables demanded admittance.
Adams informed them that lie did not
care for their company. Andrew i'on
wav. 1209 North Seventh street, later
returned and started a quarrel with
Adams. Mrs. Adams ha<t been away
during the encounter and on her re
turn she found her husband lying on
the doer In a pool of blood. He was
taken to the hospital in an unconscious
condition but afterward revived suffi
ciently to identify Conway as the man
who had wielded the razor. His con
dition is critical.

SEALER'S SAUERKRAUT PROBLEM
SMELLS TO HIGH HEAVEN
When you . purchase the modest
sauerkraut should you fiot receive full
measure, crushed solidly to the brim,
ratlier than a meed of sprays sifted
tenderly and delicately from the dis
penser's fork like new hay from the
mow ?
That's quite a problem and it's one
by the way, that has City Sealer Harry
D. Keel his head in be
wilderment. During: the last several
weeks a number of more or less Indig
nant lovers of the dish that noes with
side-pork and mashed potatoes, have
complained bitterly of the miserliness
of the sauerkraut dealer.
The question Is this; of late when

"Clear-Cut" Violation of

Says of Marina Tragedy
Washington, D. C„ Doc. 11.—
Announcement was made at tlie
State Department to-day' that
complete information now at
hand covering the case of the
British horse ship Marina, tor
pedoed with a loss of six Ameri
cans, makes it appear to be a
"clear-cut" violation of Ger
many's pledges to the United
Slates.
Full information in the case of (he
Arabia will be awaited before the next
move is made, which is expected to
take the form of a new note intended
to clear up what appear to be differ
ences of interpretation on what Ger
many's pledges in the Sussex case
actually covered, especially with refer
ence to armed ships.
Gougler, Convicted of
Enticement, Like to Be
Sentenced This Week
Absence of Senator E. E. Beidle
man, of counsel for the defense, pre
vented the calling for sentence this
morning of Benjamin T. Gougler, the
Pennsylvania Railroad conductor, who
was convicted after ten minutes' de
liberation by a Dauphin county jury
of enticing pretty 13-year-old Jo
sephine Crawford to the Crystal hotel.
Gorigler it is expected will not be
called until tlie Senator returns and
Attorney A. 11. Hull, also of counsel
for the defense, said he does not ex
pect the senior attorney to return to
the city to-day.
In a sealed verdict this morning a
jury acquitted Damjam Rakas and
Juro Chucokuovic, Steelton, of con
spiracy and arson.

behind the counter guyly stab a fork

cately sprinkle it into the tin measure
and so till it up.
In days of yore, the marketer soul
fully recalled, one stood by with wat
ering mouth and saw the tin measure
stuffed and crammed to the top.
"What's a man to do?" demanded
Sealer's Reel stiffly. "What can 1 tell
'em? There's nothing in the State
laws to determine whether kraut shall
be bought and sold by a dry or liquid
measure. It's a real one, is this sauer
kraut problem. It smells, too, to high

Wonderful Possibilities in
Capitol Park Extension De

architectural expert, and Warren H.

gineer, who have been selected by

i New York and Mr. Manning will stay
on for a day to confer 011 some city
I problems with the City Planning Com
mission.
Preliminary Conference
Mr. Brunner said that to-day's con
ference is largely of a preliminary
character as the movement was still
in a more or less formative state. The
experts have gone over the extension
zone, collected a lot of data so that
another inspection trip to-day was
not considered necessary.
I.ate this afternoon the two experts
attended a meeting of the Board of
Public Grounds and Buildings at
which the former presided.
Mr. Brunner brought along
I Antony Di Nardo, one of his draughts
j men and Mr. Manning was accom
panied by his son. The four with Mr.
