Interviewer Doesn't Dare Ask
Villa About Wound.
New York, Dec. 11. "I am going to
drive the Americans out of Mexico or
make them fight."
This is tne declaration of Francisco
Villa as reported in an interview print
ed by the New York Kvening World
today. Thorkel Flood Mortensen, the
interviewer, says he went to Villa's
headquarters at Quinta Luz the second
day of the occupation or the city of
Chihuahua.
"Do you know the mayor of El
Paso?" Villa asked. "Do you know
what he did? Chased my wife out of
the country like a common peon wom
an of the street, and took her dia
monds and rinss away from her. Tell
that follow if he were a man he would
come down and fight with me and
not fight with a woman who is a
stranger in his country. 1 know him;
he is an avocado for the cientificos

brother) did not the North Ameri-.

Violated Sacred Rights.
"Do you know Pershing? Pershing
is violating the sacred rights of Mex
ico and has got to get out. I will show
tin m. peco tiempo, that they can not
violate Mexican rights.
"Do you know Wilson? was his
friend. I liked him, but at Agua
Prieta he turned traitor to me and the
cause I represented and helped Car
rair.a. the bad man of Mexico. Is
there any wonder that I chase the
Americans out of Mexico?"
Asked what he intended to do, lie
replied:

tries so wide and deep that no Amerti
cano will ever be able to steal Mexi
can land. old or oil."
Americans Were Asleep.
''General," Villa was asked, "how
could you make the daring attack on
Colonel Slocum's forces at Columbus
and k'et away across the big plains?"
"Kasy." Villa answered. "I was
nwa.ke: they were sleeping and it took
them too long to wake up."
"You must have had many men."
"Yes, 1 had about 300."
The interviewer said he was careful
not to ask Villa about his injured
fait, tin the advice of General Salazar,
with whom tie first talked, and also
by the same general's advices, not to
contradict Villa in any way. Villa's
fool is still stiff, he said, tho the
wound he received in the battle of
Guerrero has healed.

NAME NEW LEADERS TUESDAY
War Slowed Down by Snow,
Rain and Mud.
Vigorous Measures for Daring
Campaign Demanded.
Paris, Dec. 11 Premier Briand was
busy today seeing not only politicians
but prominent business men and
manufacturers in view of the new
commission, to facilitate which all
ministers and under secretaries will
hand in their resignations. In the
meantime, according to the Matin, the
reorganization of the higher com
mand in the army being an essen
tially administrative question wHl not
be settled until after the new gov
ernment makes its bow in the cham
ber of deputies on Tuesday and is en
dorsed by a vo'te of confidence.
''In addition to forming a war coun
cil of five ministers on the model of
that in England," continues the Matin,
"Premier Briand has decided, in the
interest of the economic organization
of the country to throw the old admin
istrative system into the melting pot
and oblige all ministerial departments
hither congealed in superannuated
methods, to get in line with the rest
of the country which is freely spend
ing its blood and gold."
Give Leaders Free Hand.
In the course of conversations he
had with prominent men on Saturday
and Sunday, Premier Briand an
nounced that he intended to give .
free hand to the ministers, under-sec-retaries
and directors forming part of
the new ministry. The most absolute
powers will be tainted to them. If it
is found that the methods meet re
sistance or that certain habits are per
sisted in, the powers will be still fur
ther increased and drastic measures
taken. The composition of the new
combination will clearly show the new
spirit. It will he the most complete
possible reconstruction as. will be seen
when their names are published.
Look to England.
Paris, Dec. 11. More and more
England's limited war council idea is
gaining support in France. More and
more is Lloyd-George being regarded
as England's man of the hour.
France is not wasting time in pes
simistic reflections over Rumania and
Greece. On the contrary the nation s
setting its jaws the more firmly and
demanding action that will be imme
diate and daring. With the slowdown
of activity along the west forced by
chilling and unceasing rain, clammy
rogs and seas or mud. events m Eng
land, Greece and Rumania loom all
the more prominently here.
An accurate reflection of France's
spirit today was given by Henry
Cheron, a prominent senator, who
published in today's Petit Parisien,
this analysis of France's situation:
Not Fault of Republic.
"The crisis of authority reigning in
France now is not the fault of the re
public for if ever a republic proved
itself worthy it is now, while travers
ing tragic events. It is not the fail
ure of the legislature, for when the
truth is known the legislature, it will
be seen, has seconded, not hindered
governmental action.
"Then why is authority lacking?
because we have used peace-time
methods instead of doing what we
should have done what more than
ever we must do and that is to con
centrate direction and assure vigor
ous prosecution of the war."
The senator concludes with the dec
laration that France needs "few men
but men of less talk and more action;
with a concentration of governmental
authority like that of which England
has just given us an example.''
Demands Courageous Acts.
"We mu?t follow that example," the
article concludes. "The present pre
mier has not failed to display all quali
ties necessary in facing the heavy re
sponsibilities of the present hour. It
will suffice to have him adopt war
methods. France demands a spirit of
dcii?ion, of firmness and of cour
ageous acts. Fortune 1 as never
smiled on any but men who were ener
getic and audacious."
Cheron is an accurate barometer of
public opinion in the present govern
mental situation. This spirit of
France will undoubtedly find expres
sion shortly in acts paralleling Eng
land's present decision.

Use of Housewives

BUTTER COMES DOWN TODAY
Grocers Admit General Boycott
Would Itower Prices.
Eggs Are Three Cents Cheaper
Today Than Saturday.
Topeka housewives today expressed
their approval of the threatened boy
cott on butter and eggs to be decided
upon at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
at a meeting of the board of manage
ment of the Women's club at the
Young Women's Christian association.
At the same time Topeka grocers ad
mitted that a boycott, if pursued
thruout the country, would pull down
the prices of these two commodities.
Cheerful was the news received this
morning to the effect that butter had
dropped two cents this morning as a
result of boycotts already in effect in
other cities. Creamery butter sold
for 37 cents a pound this morning.
"We don't wish it understood that
we have initiated a boycott," said Mrs.
S. S. Beggs, president of the Woman's
club. "We are considering it and will
decide upon our future action at the
meeting tomorrow afternoon."
"Whatever they do at that meeting,
the women of Topeka surely will stand
behind them," said Mrs. Lilla Day
Monroe.
In many Topeka homes the boycott
which already has caused the high
prices to decrease to some extent has
been in operation. Topeka women in
terested in the boycott are preparing
excellent menus for publication which
can be served without the use of but
ter and eggs in cooking.
Coffee Up Now.
"Food prices never will come down
again," gloomily prophesied a Topeka
grocer today, as he gazed -at a letter
from his coffee wholesalers notifying
him of another half cent increase in
the price of the commodity to take
effect December 15.
"Of course butter and eggs will
fluctuate, but the bulk of the food
products have been boosted up to stay
by the market controllers.
"The coffee market is controlled by
J. P. Morgan," the grocer continued,
"and in the last five years coffee prices
have practically doubled."
Whether the result of boycott or not
butter dropped 2 cents a pound today,
it being priced at the highest-price
grocers at 40 cents a pound. Eggs
dropped 3 cents a dozen today. De
pending upon the grocer they may be
purchased at from 39 cents to 42 cents
a dozen. . -
Sugar fell again today, a dollar now
being able to cover eleven -pounds.
This is a drop of 20 cents on a hun
dred pounds in the last week. Best
quality flour today may be purchased
at 12. 65 for fifty pounds, as against
$2.85 five days ago.
Canned Goods Up.
But canned goods are still soaring
serenely above the clouds. The cheap
est grade canned corn today brings
$1.65 a dozen while the better quality
is $2.00 a dozen. Canned baked beans
were selling a week ago at "0, 15 and
20 cents a can, according to grade.
With this morning's latest advance
they retailed at the terms of 13, 18
and 25 cents per tin.
Concerning beans the grocers have
further woes to retail. "Eight years
ago we sold the navy bean as low .as
(Copyright
eight pounds for a quarter," they tell.
"Today we must charge 15 cents a
pound' and , we '; make not as much
profit as we?did in the old days. And
the best graae ot lima beans brings 20
cents a pound today."
"Rice Is the only edible that has not
risen m price in the last few months.
Meat has been comparatively station
ary 'ior several months and is today -comparatively
speaking the cheapest
ting an the market.."
. - - Crackers Way1 Up. 'V
"And then take the case of crack
ers." continue the grocers. "We can
easily remember when we were selling
them for ?cents a pound. This morn
ing the wholesalers jumped the ante
on us 214 cents; makin-r the retail
price , 12 Ms :, cents a pound."
Potatoes' showed no change today.
NO MOREHUNTING
Farmers Southwest of Topeka
Declare W ar on Jiimrods.
All Trespassers Will Be Prose
cuted by Grange. -
Following the murder of John Cox, '
deputy game warden, by Claude Big
gers. a negro," last week, there will
be no more hunting southwest of To- j
peka. Members of the Oak Grange j
have banded together to enforce the
game laws. Nearly all of the farmers
southwest of town in the neighborhood
of the murder belong to the G-range
and they have made arrangements
with county officers for a strict en
forcement of the law.
The members of the Grange will re
port all violations of the law to the
sheriff and he will make complaint to
the county attorney. The county at
torney will secure the necessary war
rants. The law prohibits all persons
from hunting upon the premises of an
other -without the written permission
of the owner. No written permission
will be issued in the Oak Grange
neighborhood.
Resolutions to that effect were
adopted at a meeting held following
the murder of John Cox and a com
mittee took the matter up with county
officials.
"Criminal prosecutions will be
br6ught when Grange members re
port violations of the game law said
W. E. Atchison, county attorney, to

LLOYD-GEORGE ILL
New Premier Indoors Today Sends
Letter to Parliament.
! London, Dec. 11. Lloyd-George's
superhuman endeavors of the past
week in reconstructing England's gov-
' ernment, brought him down with a
severe chill today. Physicians orders
! forbade him leaving his home today,
and a letter whicn the premier wrote
to members of , parliament indicated
: his belief that he would be unable to
attend the session of parliament to
morrow at which the new cabinet will
formally take it place.
"The one predominant task before
the government is a vigorous prose
cution of a war of a triumphant con
clusion." Lloyd-George declared in
his letter to members of parliament.
"I am confident I can rely on your
support and that you will long devote
your energies effectively to that end."
Kisses Hand of King.
While the premier remained in
doors, his new ministers were formally
received at Buckingham palace by
King George and kissed his majesty's
hand. ( ,
A meeting of the privy council, call

to the newly accredited cabinet members.

"Egg Refrain" Popular in All
K. C. Restaurants.
Chicago, Dec. 11. Fire from three
quarters was to be poured into the
stronghold of commission men and
speculators believed to control the
country's foodstuffs here today. The
federal grand jury, the, state utilities
commission and the executive board
of the National Retail Grocers' asso
ciation are hot on the trail today and
a break in prices due to pressure from
these bodies is expected.
epresentative retail grocers from
Chicago, San Francisco, New Tork,
Boston, New Orleani, St. Paul and
Des Moines will attend the meeting of
the executive council of the national
retail grocers association.
"It is probable that a boycott
against commission men, jobbers and
wholesalers who have taken advantage
of conditions to force unusual profits
will be instituted by retailers all over
the country," Frank B. Connolly of
San Francisco, vice-president of the
association, said here today.
To Congress for Food Embargo.
The grocers -will also be asked to
send a committee to congress to work
for embargoes on foodstuffs.
Sol Westerfield of Chicago, charged
the United States department of ag
riculture with making inaccurate re
ports concerning foodstuffs stored
here. He will ask the grocers to in
vestigate the report that the Chicago
butter and egg board found 700,000
more eggs In storage than were enum
erated in the last government report.
When the state utilities commission'
meets today, an order to limit the
time foodstuffs may be held In storage
and to force standardized and accurate
bookkeeping by cold storage houses
will be considered.

400 Restaurants Boycott Eggs.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 11. Kansas
City's egg "refrain" is a success, A
B. Crader, secretary of the Kansas
City Restaurant Men's association an
nounced today. "Few persons have
calied for eggs in Kansas City's 4U0
restaurants and eating places since
the boycott was clamped on officially
yesterday morning," Crader said.
The "refrain" is to continue until
prices are normal.
Fifty thousand new stickers for
menus and two thousand new counter
placards were distributed to restau
rant men today. The new appeal to
the public read, ""Help bust the egg
trust; don't eat eggs until the price is
right."
BURDEN ON PUBLIC
I Readers Must Stand Shortage
in Print Paper.
Senator Curtis Has Bill in
Congress Today.
Washington, Dec. 11. Senator Cur
tis has prepared a bill to prevent un
due discrimination in the sale of print
paper to relieve the conditions of the
smaller publishers of Kansas and
other states who are complaining that
they cannot get contracts with the
mills at any price. The bill prohibits
discrimination on price between pur
chasers regardless of the quantity pur
chased and also makes it unlawful for
any person or corporation to make
contracts with larger purchasers and
refuse to make similar contracts with
smaller purchasers. Violations are
punishable by a fine of not more than
$1,000 or imprisonment not exceed
ing five years or both. Enforcement
is vested in the federal trade commis
sion. The smaller publishers all over the
country are appealing for help, con
fronted by the most threatening con
ditions and unable to forecast what
the next day may bring. Contracts are
refused at any price and no assurance
given them of being able to purchase
the paper needed for even the imme
diate future.
It has been alleged that contracts
are being made with larger publishers
at 3 cents or less while the smaller
ones are paying 6 or 7 cents now and
threatened with a 10-cent price.
"Newspapers have ceased to be a
luxury and have become an absolute
necessity," said Senator Curtis.
"Present conditions are intolerable
and the public must bear this seem
ingly unnecessary burden. The raise
in the price in newspapers is inevitable
and for some, failure can probably not
be avoided unless remedy is quickly
found."

Xew Premier Practically Dicta
tor of Great Britain..
ANNOUNCES NEW CABINET
Milnet, Henderson and Premier
Are War Council.
Cut Off Luxuries; May 3Iake
Entire atlon Dry.
London, Dec. 11.- England's every
resource is to be turned into the war.
Every luxury is to be cut off; every
activity turned into the serious busi
ness of fighting.
Nothing could be clearer than this
decision n the public's belief after an
nouncement of David Lloyd-George's
new cabinet today and consideration
of preliminary measures to be en
acted. The little Welshman becomes prac
tically dictator of England. Associated
with him in the "war council" are Earl
Curzon, who will be government lead
er in the house of lords; Andrew
Bonar Law, who will be leader in the
house of commons; Arthur Henderson
and Lord Milner, ministers without
portfolio.
Triumvirate to Conduct War. "
Because Curzon and Iw will be
largely occupied with their duties in
the two houses, the war council really
narrows down to a permanent mem
bership of three men and two of
these, Milner and Henderson, are
without other tasks than that of mem
bers of the war council. They are left
entirely free in order to prosecute
the war, with Lloyd-George.
Thus the government forces are
aligned for efficiency.
This new government also plans
efficiency thru reforms as to public
