'damage* because Detective J. N. Wilk
anion accused him of guilty knowledge
of the murder of Joe MoQre, 'Us fam
ily and Ills guests ,In the notorious Vil
lisca az murdera of June 9,1912.
That is the verdict of the twelve

murder of Joe Moore, file wife, his four

Detective Wilkerson. was assigned to

friends.

ator Jones had been ^Implicated in a
plot which ended In the ax murders.
Onoe Refused to Indict.
Wilkerson attempted to obtain the
indictment of Senator Jones before the
Villiaca grand jury last spring. He
also attempted to secure the indict
ment of Blackle Mansfield, arrested on
suspicion' of having been the actual
murderer. The jury returned no bills.
Shortly afterward Senator Jones
filed his suit against Wilkerson asking
for $60,000 for the statements Wilker
son bad made charging him with
guilty knowledge of the crime.
•JUie suit at first included also four
teen residents of Villisca, but the other
actions we're dropped-by Senator Jones.
When the trial of the suit began at
Red Oak nearly four Weeks ago, Wilk
ersop frankly admitted that he, had
made the statements objected to, and
declared that he was justified in saying
what he did. The trial, therefore, be
came more of the nature of a 'murder
trial than of a mere action to recover
damages.
Senator Jones hoped, by obtaining a
verdict against Willcerison, to clear his
name of the shadow of suspicion which
had been cast upon hi'm.

Indications today point more
strongly than ever to the probabil
ity that the new defensive line of
the Roumanians, following their re
treat from Bucharest, will be drawn
along the Buzeu river, forming the
aonthern boundary of the northern
province of Moldavia.'
Additional reports from Petro
grad indicate a considerable meas
ure of success of the Roumanian
northern army in holding the Teu
tonic army along the railroad from
Poloehti to the town of Buzeu, lo
cated at about the center of the
Buzeu river line, which stretches
eastward to the lower reaches of
the Danube.
It is necessary to the apparent
purpose of the Roumanians for
them to prevent an Austro-German
advance hsrc until the Roumanian
forces, farther south' in eastern
Wallachia, retreating from the re
gion' between Bucharest and
Tchernavoda, have reached the
Buzeu river line, unless, Indeed, the
Roumanian military authorities
have decided to retain a hold on a
greater part of Wallachia than it
now seems their determination to
defend.
These forces are threatened by
new contingents of Bulgarians who
have crossed the Danube between
Sillstria and" Tchernavoda.
Meanwhile the Russians are ham

line in western Moldavia and re
