la Seaffle Club
Vernon Ayau, shortstop of the Chi
nese Travelers' baseball team, will
play with the Seattle ( club of the
Northwest League next season. Ayau
is the first Chinese baTTpllayer tobe
given an opportunity to perform in a
league of this strength. Bill Leard,
who will manage the Seattle club next
year, signed Ayau this morn ins after
a short conference. .:'
Vernon Ayau is well known to the
baseball fans of Hawaii, as he has
starred for a number of years with
he. Chinese team. His great work
k'th. the Chinese Travelers has Li-
vvkrted attention throughout the coun
try, and, according to th members of
the All-Americans, is one of the fast
est fielders In the business.
; There is no question about Ayau
.making good in the fielding line, as
he "will have It on any of the short
fielders in the Northwest circuit. Few
players in the game today can go as
far to the right and throw runners out.
Without a doubt he will be a real sen
nation In the league. He has cam
paigned with the Travelers every day
during the season and this work will
mean much, to him. Against the visit
ing pitchers he has hit well and will
without doubt, hold his Own in this
department. Two or three weeks ago
the Star-Bulletin discussed the mat
ter with both Swain and Leard and
both agreed that Ayau was a "smart
tall player, capable of making good in
fast company.
Honolulu hai sent Johnny Williams
and Barney Joy to the minor leagues,
and "Lefty" York, who pitched for the
, 1st Infantry, will' play with Vancouver
next season. Ayau is a popular player
in Honolulu and will without doubt
make Rood with the fans In the North
west League. He has good habits,
and, furthermore. Is always in condi
tion. Honolulu will watch with inter
est the work of the popular shortstop
next season.

GOVERNOR CONFERS
l'JiTIID.E.METZGER
Territorial Senator Delbert E. Metz
ger came to Honolulu from Hilo last
Saturday and ha$ had a conference
with Governor Pinkham, but on the
best authority it can be said that
there have been no developments in
the secretaryship situation. Metzger
is not after the vacancy made by V.
W. Thayer's resignation, say his
friends, and It Is understood that no
recommendation has been made by
the governor. Neither is Inclined to
discuss the report, which was given
Impetus when Sletzger returned from
8aker, Oregon, a few daysjago, after
16 months' absence from. Hawaii. ' C
Metzger still retains business inter-
pctK in the Northwest and mav eo
ifback fora short trp tail Winter,' tut-
bis plans are now to spena me next
few months in Hawaii, mostly at his
home in HUo. He has not given up
residence In the territory and does
not intend to. Recently he leased the
Waiakea quarry near Hilo to Richard
Dcming lor the American Surety Com
pany, cn the same terms as he had
leased it to Contractor Marshall, for
use in building the Hilo breakwater
extension.
".Metz" is lighter by eight or: ten
pounds than when his friends here
last saw him, but he is a booster for
the Northwest nevertheless. He "will
be In Honolulu for several days. Dame
Rumor continues busy with reports
that after conferences with the gov
ernor there may be developments in
the secretaryship, but the reports are
bused on little knowledge. Another
rumor Is that he may be connected
with the Hilo breakwater work now
taken over -by the American Surety
Company. Metzger put through suc
cessfully the first contract on this big
loo. Since then successive contract
ors have had disastrous financial ex
periences. FILIPINO VJOMAN
FREED OF MURDER
Elena Hojas, a comely Filipino wo
man, walked out of Circuit Judge Ash
ford's court this morning free. ! She
had been charged with first degree
murder, having shot and killed a Fili
pino man at Waipahu, but. at the in
stance of City Attorney Arthur M.
Brown, her rase was nolle prossed.
Attorney Brown, giving the facts of
the case, said he did not feel he could
ever secure a conviction for first de
gree murder or any lesser charge. He
explained that everything went to
show that the woman had shot and
killed the man in defense of her hon
or that the man had entered her
room .and attempted to assault her.
Circuit Judge Ashford remarked
that, while it was unusual to nolle
prosse a first' degree murder case, "he
had practically advised the city at
torney to take this action, so far as it
was within his power to oflcr such
advice. 1 ",

Citizens Oppose Starting Work
With Only One Unit Under
Consideration
Opposition to proceeding with the
Waikiiti reclamation project with the
so-called Unit No. l; portion outlined
by Charles R. Torbes and the public
works department or with any portion
until a complete and careful survey of
the entire area, has been made was the
thief teattfre'ora lengthy meeting in
the governor's chamber at the capitol
this morning.
Walter F. Dillingham led the plea
for a comprehensive scheme and he
was seconded by Archie Young, John
Bowler, Judge W. L. Stanley and W.
W. Chamberlain, all of whom spoke
briefly on the subject.
Dillingham's argument clung to the
point that the government rby dam
ming ' up Makiki and Manoa streams
had been largely responsible for the
present condition of the . WaikikI
swamps. ' He opposed making the pro
perty owners pay for all of such a
project when the government "has
turned on the hose." He. emphasized
the need of a complete survey of the
whole ktea which exceeds by 100 per
cent hc business district of Hono
lulu.., " .
John Bowler voiced the same feeling
imtronger worJs. He said that even
now tCalakaua avenue is ' being put
through without thought of head or
tall, a "piece of damn rascality which
the property owners are paying for."
: Forbes in the beginning of the meet
ing outlined his reasons for drawing
up plans for the project. A letter from
Deputy Attorney-General A. G. Smith
followed, gtvln?; the reasons for a
more vomprehensive scheme than out
lined :n Forbes plans for one unit
Governor .Pinkham declared toward
the close of the meeting that he saw
no reason why, with the territory's
big in.-ome and good financial stand
ing, it should not help out largely with
the WaikikI and other, projects.
As the matter now stands it seems
probable that nothing more will be
done under the Unit No. 1 plan, but
that a scheme for the whole will be
drawn up and probably presented at
the ' legislature . two months hence.
Forbes declared after the meeting that
the plans he has drawn for a single
unit are practically . ' pau."
