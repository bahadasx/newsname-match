Will insist on Right to Chase Ma

FINAL PROPOSAL COMES TODAY
Administration Wearied of Dillydally
ing Tactics of Carranza's
" " Commissioners.
Atlantic City, Nov. 20. The three
Mexican commissioners will receive to
morrow morning from their American
colleagues in the joint commission a
clear and simple proposal for the ad
justment of the difficulties arising; be
tween this country and Mexico over
the chase of Villa by Gen Pershing.
This proposal, having been ap
proved by President Wilson and Sec
retary of State Lansing, received this
afternoon the emphatic approval of
the three American niemoers of the
commission, Secretary Lane, John R.
Mott and George Gray. It is designed
to prepare for the withdrawal of the
American troops from Mexico, the
patrolling of the border and the right
of American troops to pursue into
Mexico any bandits who may again
make a raid on United States soil.
The American delegation held a
meeting this afternoon immediately
after the return of Secretary Lane
from Washington. They made up their
minds, with the President's approval,
to dillydally no longer. The suggest
ion that the Mexican delegates either
saw wood or quit talking will be con
veyed to them at a joint session to
morrow morning in the most polite
and diplomatic language that . the
Americans can employ.
The plain which will be laid before
the Mexicans does not by any means
corervery point "that must tie Tils-'
cussed and settled before everything
is again harmonious between Presi
dent Wilson and First Chief Carranza.
It has to do only with the military
phases of the controversy. If It is re
jected by the Mexican delegates, then
in all likelihood the sessions of the
joint commission will come to a
speedy end.
- The plan Is said to be so clear that
nobody can find any diplomatic sub
terfuge or evasion in it. The hint hero
Is that the Mexican commissioners
will have no chance to haggle over its
terms.

German Attacks on South Bank cf
Stream Successful
BERLIN SAYS DRIVE IS CHECKED
Also Intimates that Army Is Now in
Position to Soon Assume
Offensive.
London, Nov. 20. British troops no
longer hold the western edge of
Grandcourt, on the south bank of the
Ancre. Berlin reports. German infan
try bombed the British out of the
ruined houses with hand grenades af
ter Haig's men had hi Id them less
than forty-eight hours.
The British official report makes no
mention of their troops being driven
out of Grandcourt.
According to the Germans the day
was one of unsuccessful attacks by
British and French troops. The Brit
ish mado more attacks on the Ancre
front without success. Tho French
delivered an assault against St. Pierre
Vaast Wood with fresh troops, but al
so were thrown back.
During the past week the German
counter attacks have resulted in the
capture of 22 officers, 900 men and ,'!4
machine guns. The number of pris
oners is about evenly divided between
French and British.
According to the German state
ments the British drive on the Ancre
front has been stopped temporarily at
least, with the loss of only three vil
lages, Beaumon-Hamel, St. Pierre Di
vlon and Beaucourt-sur-Anche. The
situation of the German front is now
Biich, however, that it is believed more
suecessful attacks can be made there
Ptomi.
Today is the fourth consecutive day
that activity has been announced on
the little strip of Belgian soil held by
the Belgian army. Belgians and Ger
mans were in hand grenade fights
near Dixmude. and Boesinghe, where
the Belgian and German artillery also
were engaged.
WHY RUMANIA FAILS
German Writer Says Army is Not
Properly Equipped
Rumania's failure to withstand the
Austro-Geruian offensive in Transyl
vania" is to be ascribed, according to
Joseph Wirth, correspondent of the
Berlin Lokalanzelger. principally to
the lack of high trajectory iiu.1 moun
tain artillery and to Inferior leader
ship, which, the writer says, is utterly
without practical experience, although
equipped with all modern strategic
and tactical theories. The subsidiary
causes, the correspondent says, ar
the lack of barbed-wire entanglements,
necessitating the use of almost worth
less tree branches; the adherence to
old style Russian trenches with over
head covering against- shrapnel,
which, however, cave in disastrously
with the anival of the first shell, and
in addition, the surprising lark of
equipment for many of the troops, as
well as telephone material, wagons
and aviators. The correspondent
continues:
"The Rumanians have not even
adopted the almost universal trans
portable kitchen wagon, but still cur
ry food to the troops at the front in
cans loaded on wagons.
"The Rumanians fight far better
when defending their own territory,
than when on tho offensive or de
fensive on Austro-Hungarian soil.
They looked for a short, decisive cam
paign and were unprepared for a long
fight of the present character.
"Rumanian officers all carry and
study religiously a general staff book
on lessens learned from the war, but
they seem to be unable to apply them
practicably. This partly, perhaps, is
because the character of the warfare
on the Rumanian border is unlike that
on the Russian and French fronts.
The differences are enhanced and Aus-tro-Hungurluu
uniforms."

POPULAR BUG SONG
As Full of Microbes as It Is of
Rhythm
In these days of indigestion
It is oftentimes a question
As to what to eat and what to leave
nlono
For each microbe and bacillus
Has a different way to kill us
And in time they always claim us for
their own.
There are germs of every kind
In any food that you can find
In tho market or on any bill of fare.
Prinking water's Just at rlsky
As the so called deadly whisky.
And It's often a mistake to breathe
tho alv.
Some little bug is going to find you
some day
Some little bug will creep behind you
some day.
Then he'll send for his bug friends
And all your earthly trouble ends
Some little bug is going to find you
some day.
The inviting green cucumber
Gets most everybody's number
While the gretn corn has a system
of its own:
Though a radish seems nutritious
It's behavior is quite vicious
And the doctor- will be coming to
your house.
Fating lobster cooked or plain
Its only flirting with ptomaine.
While an oyster sometimes has a lot
to say.
But the clams we eat In chowder
Make the angels chant the louder
For they know that we'll be with
them right away.
Take a slice of nice fried onion
And you're fit for Dr. Muuyon;
Apple dumplings kill you quicker
than a uaia.
Chew a cheesy midnight rabbit
And a grave you'll soon inhabit
Ah! to eat at all Is such a foolish
game.
Eating huckleberry pie is a easy way
to die
While sauerkraut brings on soltening
of the brain.
When you cat banana fritters
Every undertake r titters
And the casket makers nearly go
Insane.
Some little bug is going to find you
some day
Some little bug will creep behind you
some day
With a nervous little quiver
He II give cirrhosis of the liver
Some little bug Is going to find you
soiiifl day.
When cold storage vaults I visit
I can only say what Is it
Makes poor mortals fill their system
with such stuff?
Now for breakfast prunes are dandy
If a stomach pump is handy
And jour doctor can be found quite
soon enough.
Eat a plate of fine pig's knuckles
And the head-stone cutter chuckles,
While the grave digger maken a note
upon his cuff.
Eat that lovely red bologna
And you'll wear a wood klmona
As your relatives start Rcrappiug
for your stuff.
Some little bug is going to find you
some day.
Some little bug will creep behind you
sumo day.
Eating juicy sweet pineapple
Makes the sexti&n dust the chapel.
Some little bug is going to find you
some day.
All the crazy foods they mix
Will float us cross the River Styx
Or they'll start us climbln:; up

And the meals we eat in courses
Mean a hearse and two black horses
So before each meal come people

Luscious grapes breed 'p?n. Ileitis

So there's only deatli to greet uh

Brotherhood Heads Will Assist ft

CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT
Chairman Adamson, Who Drafted
Eight-Hour Law, Says There
Will Ee No Strike.
Washington, Nov. 21. Heads of the
railroad em ploy C3 brotherhoods, who
are determined that the Adamson
eight-hour law shall not bo broken
down conferred yesterday with Presi
dent Wilson, Attorney-General Greg
cry and their legislative representa
tives, declared their purpose to aid the
government in every way in fighting
injunction suits ugaiust the law and
made further plans for perfecting a
working agreement with their allies,
the railroad men of the American
federation of labor. When the gov
ernment lawye.-r., li. Carroll Todd, as
sistant to the attorney-general, As
sistant Attorney-General Underwood
and Frank Hagermuri appear in the
federal court at Kansas City next
Thursday to oppose the Union I
and Atchison, lopcka and Santa Fe
suits against the Adamson law, they
will be Hanked by representatives of
the brotherhoods. It is probable that
the four brotherhood heads theni
uelves will be there.
Great hignitUancc is attached to the
announcement yesterday that the
brotherhood heads will address the
American iede ration of labor conven
tion in Baltimore today. Never be
fore in the hUtory of the two organi
zations have any of their members
Inet in Joint session,; but their meet
ing at Baltimore will be the result
of a carefully worked-out agreement
that the two for com shall 'join hands
in working for the general betterment
of the organized raihvuy employes.
After rteeiving the brotherhood
heads and Chairman Adamson, author
of tile eight-hour law. Presidi-nt WIl
son virtually finished his message to
Congress in which he will recommend
completion of the railway legislative
program outlined by him at the last
session. These recommendations in
clude provisions for the enlargement
of tne Interstate commerce commis
sion and for compulsory investigation
of proposed strikes. The latter Is bit
terly opposed by the brotherhood
leaders.
After their lVmlniite conference
with the president the brotherhood
heads would admit only that they
hud congratulated Mr. Wilson on his
re-election. Warren S. Stone, head
of the engineers, declared that he
could not tell now whether a strike
would be culled if the eight hour law
was not put into effect .lanuary 1.
Representative Adamson went over
plans for railroad legislation fully
with the president. Alterward he
said he had no doubt th.it the eight
hour law would be upheld by the
courts as constitutional, adding that
the measure was very carefully
fnimed by lawyers fully familiar with
the situation and with the constitu
tion. He nddul that be believed the in
terstate commerce commission under
existing laws already had the power
to take wages into consideration in
fixing freight rates. President Wilson
embodied a recommendation for legis
lation giving tills power when ad
dressing Congress on the threatened
strike, but the Georgia representative
said bo believed the president would
agree with him in the end.
"I do not think there Is anything in
the talk that the railroad men will
call a iitrike if the eight-hour law is
pending in the courts," ixiid Mr. Ad
amson. "In doing to they would be
running directly contrary to public,
opinion, and that no man or body of
men can afford to do."

KILLED ARCHIE REGGIE
His Brother-ln-Law Fired the Fatal
Shot.
Island Pond, Nov. 19. The murder
er of Archie Reggie, 16-yeai out sou
of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Reggie who
was Bhot down during tho night of
November 8, has been captured and
has confessed to Attorney General H.
G. Barber and State's Attorney C. R.
Powell. Charles Shainon, brother-in-law
of the Reggie boy yesterday af
ternoon told the officers when con
fronted with damaging evidence, that
he fired both shots, one of which
killed Reggie.
From an examination of over 70 wit
nesses at an inquest at which only the
officers were present the attorney gen
cral and state's attorney by a process
ol elimination decided that Shamon
or Reggie's brother, Ovil, committed
the deed. The evidence pointed rath
er to Shamon and yesterday he was
brought before the officers and short
ly after be was examined he said "1
would rather save my soul than my
lil'e." and confessed that ho was the
m:ui sought.
It appears that Ovil Reggie and a
feliow named Osborne had an argu
ment in the mill yard iu this village
on the afternoon of November 7, elec
tion day. and during the altercation,
it is alleged Ovil Reggie gave Osborne
a severe beating. Friends of Osborue,
it is claimed, started out on the fol
lowing evening with the inteutlon of
compelling Ovil Reggie to make
amends and to securo an apology.
Ovil Rog.gie was located in the
house cf a friend in this village. The
quarrel was renewed and Archie Reg
gie, it is said, attempted to pi event
his brother from being injured. Sham
on drew a revolver and fired two
shots, not Intending It is claimed to
hit his brother-in-law, but the bullets
struck the hoy. The victim died with
in a few minutes.
Shamon, who formerly lived in Port
land. Me., Is of Armenian blood but
a native of the United States. He
lias lived in Island Pond but a short
time. From tho examination of the
man t ho officers are fairly satisfied
that Shamon intended to kill one of
the gang of toughs concerned In tho
assault and t hat he had no reason to
turn his revolver upon his brother-in-law.

Omaha, Neb., Nov. 19. As one of'
the results of the recent election Ne

To be repudiated and turned down

Nebraska for all time.
It is said In political circles that Mr.
Bryan, having been entirely deserted

announce himself an out and out Pro

belongings of the officers and their
families were burned. The cause of
the fire is not known.
Boys between the ages of six and
IS years were housed in the building
and all but 10 of tho younger ones had
left the building , to attend chapot
about 20 minutes before the fire was
discovered. Two officers were in the
building at the time and they gave
their first attention to getting out the
boys who had already gone to bed.

and were given sholter in another
building.

yond confining the blaze to the one
building.
