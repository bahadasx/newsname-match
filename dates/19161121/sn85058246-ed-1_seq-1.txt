Death came after an illness of but
two days. He contracted a cold which
developed into an aggravated case of

erything possible" was done in a med
ical way for tho patient .even his
powerful and rugged" physique was

the malady and death gave him re

The death of Apostle Lyman, who
was next in line for succession to the
presidency of the Mormon, church,
marks the passing of one of tho most
striking and notable characters of I
the church and state. Coming to
Utah with an ox-team company when
a boy of six, he at once became ac
tlvo In church and state affairs and
forged his way to the front of every
line of undertaking.
He was a man who did things,
and when but still a boy he had ac
complished much more than many
men accomplish In a lifetime. While
he gave his time, his energy, and'
great ability to the work of his
church In every line, he foupd time
to attend to business and to make a
success of most ft his undertakings.
He was a pioneer -In all undertak
ings and was one of the original
Tk founders of the sugar Industry in
Utah, as well as a .builder of flour
mills, an agriculturist, an ofllcer of
state and church and a leader In pol
itics of power and accomplishments.
His record from n standpoint of
activity and accomplishments Is re
markable. Born as a frontiersman,
lie wns a pioneer teamster and bull
whacker at tho ago of eight; herds
man and cowboy nt eleven; learning
a trade at thirteen; plowing tho
trackless desorts ns a leader and cap
tain at the ago of slxtcqn; exploring
the wilds of Colorado at eighteen; i
eenty and n missionary at twenty,
with farming, attending school, pre
siding over Improvement assocla-
tlons, building the log cabin or the
I pioneer as Incidents thrown In bo-
tween. IIo was married three times
I and there wero born to him nnd his
I wives twenty-one children.

WATSON'S MEN
PLAY VISITORS
TO TIE SCORE
,The titah Aggies played a brill!
ant gamo with tho Montana State
college Saturday on Adams field and
succeedod In winning back some of
their lost laurels, although tho game
ended in a tlo at 17.
It Was tho best gamo played In
Logan In tho past two years and was
either side's until the whistle blow.
In actual playing the Utah men
had an edgo on Montana. The Mon
tana team outweighed Watson's men.
They were penalized frequently for
holding and finally in tho last quar
ter Carl Borton, playing loft tackle,
was put out of the game for slug
ging. The Aggies wore penalized but
throe times, each time flvo yards for
o'ff-sldo.
The entire Utah team played In
great fashion, but the sensational
work of Stubby Peterson was the
'feature". His run In tho third quar
ter from tho field through the whole
I Montana line and ,back field for a
touchdown brought tho crowd to Its
I feet. Stubby had been promised a
valuable prlzo by tho Logan Arms
and Sporting Goods Company if ho
would negotiate such a play and It
was evident he was determined to
win. The Utah eleven found line
plunging no avail, but made great
gains on "pen work, especially with
the forward paiu. The Aggie line
held very! well throughout the game,
excopt for a tlmotn the last quar
ter, when the RJontananB swept
down tho Held for a touchdown.
Montana klckod off and on the
first down recovered the "ball when
Johnson fumbled It. On the fourth
down, Doberg mnde a placo kick
from the, twonty-ynrdjlna. Tho Utah
men took a brace and carried tho
ball down the field to tho Montana
forty-yard line, whero a perfect for
ward pass Kapplo to Llndqulst
resulted In the first touchdown. Knp
lu kicked KO.il.
From this point on the gamo was
roplcto with features and phenomen
al work by various men. Montana
followed with a touchdown, when
Duquette blockod a kick by Mohr on
jtli ) Aggies' twonty-yard line, which
l.ico recovered and scored a touch
down. Iloberg klckod goal.
Tho Utah oloven wero pushed back
a number of times In tho third quar
ter, but enmo back each time with
fight nnd determination, which reach
ed a climax when Peterson foucht
his way through tho entire Montana
team nnd scorod a touchdown. Kap
plo kicked goal.
In tho fourth quarter Montana
started a march for tho goal that
could not bo halted and floss went
over for a touchdown.
There was some dispute about the
goal kick by Boborg, but It was fin
nlly awarded.
Tho Utah team mado a last stand
which was successful whon Kapple
negotiated a place kick from tho
forty-yard lino.
The llnoup and summary: ,
Utah (17). Montana (17).

Because General Stanovltch Is
known to him ns the betrayer of his
dearly beloved little sister, who com

rible," Is Chief of tho Okrana, Rus
sia Secret Police. Ho Is cruel and
powerful, and delights In torturing
all who are so unfortunato as to
come under his power, men and wo
men allko. It Is known to tho Gen
oral staff that a German spy Is In
their midst, nnd at the suggestion of
Stanovltch to the Grand Duko, Anton
Is given full authority to solve the
problem, as "his methods never fall."
In reality Anton Is the spy for whom
they are searching. Seeing Vern,
daughter of Stanovlch, Anton plans
a terriblo rovengo for her father's
attack on his sister. To further his
plans, Anton decides to play court
to Vera, but Is mot with the Infor
mation that Bho loves David, a youug
army ofllcer. Babushka, Anton's
mother, Is plnced as a servant In tho
Stanovltch home as a spy for Anton.
Through her, Anton learns that Vera

by Stanovltch In tho act of copying
tho papers, Anton kills him and bur
ies tho body, forcing Babushka to
tell Vera her father had gono on a
long Journoy. Tho lovers lay a trap
for Anton. Tho General and his men
rush In and catch him In the act of
copying a codo. Anton Is accused
of being n spy, but his mother de
clares Bho Is guilty. Tho Grand Duke
hands Anton a rovolver and tells him
to shoot her. Anton In splto of his
cruelty, loves his mother, nnd Instead
of shooting her goes Into tho next
room and kills himself, and Vora,
heartbroken with tho knowledgo of
