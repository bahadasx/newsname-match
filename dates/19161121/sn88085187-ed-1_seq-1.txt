WAR IS NOW IN
PITIFUL STAGE
BY WILLIAM G. SHEPARD
Written For the United Press.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.—A year ago in the ruck of
miserable humans, I made my way across the wet
fields that led to the railroad station at Monastir,
boarded a train and fled from Monastir with the Ser
bians.
"When are the English coming to help us?"' the
Serbians had asked pathetically for many days. But
the English didn't come. For some mysterious rea
son they remained in their scores of thousands at
Salonika, two hundred miles away.
To the north of us, somewhere in the mountains, we
knew that the king of Serbia with his court, was
fleeing as we were. We knew that the Serbian people,
men, women and children were moving in a eavalade
of misery from their native land.
And the English haven't come yet to Monastir.
BUT THE SERBIANS HAVE GOT THERE. Again
the king of Serbia will place his feet on Serbian soil.
There is little doubt that news dispatches within a
short time will tell of the re-entry of the Serbian king
to his own country.
The cost has been undoubtedly a huge one. There
has been no vainer loss of life aside from that in the
Verdun contest, than the loss of men about Monastir.
It cost the Bulgars thousands of men to reach Mon
astir. They have held it a year, without finding it of
any strategic value; they have lost it again, with con
siderable loss and the Serbian losses in regaining it
must have been heavier.
Monastir proves that the losses in the great war are
becoming more and more futile and useless as the war
goes on. The lines do not break; they only sway, but
in the useless swaying, thousands of men die like
germs.
The Serbians feel repaid, undoubtedly for their sac
rifices, in regaining Monastir. But the neutral world,
where sanitay remains, ought to begin to see, in the
Monastir incident, the fact that has long been appar
ent. Men are dying uselessly by the hundreds of
thousands. The war has at last reached the pitiful
•stage.

WALL HAS
11 CURSE
WOBBLING
8. W. Wall has returned from
a tour of the southern and east
ern half of the state, made in the
Interest of the movement for
"Justice to the Mountain."
The matter Is to be taken to
tho legislature tiiis winter in the
form of a memorial addressed to
the federal geographic board ask
ing that board to take from tlie
peak the name of the British ad
miral and give it officially the
name the Indians gave it- -the
board to select the name after
hearing evidence.
Mission a Success
Mr. Wall's mission was to visit
tho legislators at their homes,
present the proposed memorial
for their careful reading and un
biased consideration, and to ex
plain that the movement is one
designed to lay the old ghost
Which has disturbed the relation
ship of Tacoma and Seal tie for
II years.
He reports that from Olyinpia
and Grays Harbor clear around
to Spokane and home Mala lie
was given a hearing that for sym
pathetic understanding was most
gratifying.
Want to Lift "Curse."
Members of botli houses agreed
that if there was a way to get rid
of the silly old contest that lias
made the whole state ridiculous
in the eyes of visitors and the na
tion for a quarter century It
should not lie overlooked.
Many of the most influential
members of tho legislature were
outspokenly In favor of the plan.
Also with but a single excep
tion, so far as known, says Mr.
Wall, the newspapers of Thurs
ton, Grays Harbor, Lewis, Pa
cific, Cowlitz, Clarke, Skamania,
Walla Walla, Columbia, Whit
man, Spokane, Yakima and Kitti
tas counties —the country trav
eled over —were warmly In favor,
not only treating the matter lib
erally in the news columns on
the occasion of his visit, but advo
cating the move editorially.
Oregonlan for It.
"When I visited Portland," said
Mr. Wall, "the Oregonlan gave
nearly a column Interview under
a 'top head' reading 'War Over
Peak Near an End,' and followed
that next day with an editorial
of congratulation. The Journal
gave a strong editorial in favor.
Up to Ourselvew.
"We all know how it Is in King
county, or Seattle," continued
Mr. Wall, "where every newspa
per has given favorable expres
sion on the subject, and organiza
tions representing all the
churches of western Washington
have passed resolutions in Its
favor. So, to my mind, it amounts
to Just this: If we do not effect
this change, about which we have
talked so long and so much, we
will have no one to blame but
ourselves. Everybody else Is
about ready and willing."
The Pierce county legislative
delegation has set 2 o'clock Sat

considering the question of the

TO APPOINT
FOOD COST
COMMITTEE
A commission of food ex
perts will be appointed this
week by Mayor I'auvelt, to
investigate the increasing
cost of foodstuffs, and take n
swat at old man High Cost
of Living by ad vising Taco
niaiis in the use of less ex
pensive dishes.
Mayor Fawcett heartily accept
ed the suggestion of MM a comm
ission, as made by The Thii"H
Monday.
"1 think that au -.'durational
campaign, to teach Tacoimi house
wives how to purchase food at
cheaper prices, is a great Idea,"
del hired the mayor.
"It is only v question with me
of selecting the right per—— r'"'
the commission. The food ex
pertsa re all so busy mal.ing a liv
ing for themselves, that il is guile
a problem to select qualified per
sons for the places who are at
the same lime able to give I'ie
proper amount of time to the
work.
"I will unnounce tho names of
tho food commission within a day
or so."
The experts on the food eoni
nii.aicin will make a close study
of food prices in Tacoma.
Then they will select, the loss
costly foodstuffs -.-these which of
fer proper nutrition for humen
bodies, yet are not commonly used
on our tables- and announce re
cipes for preparing these articles
in apctizing ways.
Advises Preserving Foods.
"There are dozens of different
food commodities which could be
used to cut down the cost of liv
ing, if people WOUld OIII.V learn to
prepare the dishes in an appeal
ing manner," said Mayor Fawcett.
The mayor is a strong advocate
of the idea of preserving foods at
times when they are cheap. lie
advises all housewives to preserve
foods In their proper season, as a
means of cutting down table costs.
"If peopk> would put up kegs
of salmon while the fish are cheap
and preserve vegetables and fruits
in their proper season, they
would not have such a senre over
the high cost of living during lie
winter months," he declared.
Woman Volunteers.
Mrs. Marguerite McConihe,
3308 North 28th street, appeared
at Mayor Fawcett's office Tues
day and offered to be a member
of the committee.
Mrs. McC'onihe advised that the
food commission might gain bet
ter results by studying a compari
son of food prices in Tacoma und
other Northwestern cities. She
asserted that Tacoma is paying
more for food than any other city
In this part of the country. Meats
and vegetables, particularly, are
far cheaper in other cities, she
said.
