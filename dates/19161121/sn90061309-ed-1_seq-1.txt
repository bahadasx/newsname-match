Greater Monroe
More Prosperity to be Brought by
the Dairy Industry.
The farmers mid business men
are pullinii together fur a Greater
Monroe und a greater and more
prosperous community. They are
working for bigger dairy enterprises,
which mean more money for this
community. By this method of
farming, the farmers make morp,
money, get it at all times of the
year and at the same time make
(heir farms more fertile instead of
impoverishing them. The interest
taken in the duiry meeting Friday,
indicates that the farmers are in
terested. Already there are several
dairy herds near here, and all are
making money. Thus it has been
fully demonstrated that dairying
pays here. Other farmers are get
ting interested and are going to
get into the game, All this spells
a Greater and More Prosperous
Monroe City and vicinity. The bus
iness men of Monroe City are an
xious to do their part toward mak
ing this a dairying community. The
banquet Friday evening was at
tended by about seventy five far
mers and others interested. Splen
did talks were made by Mr. Mer
rill, State Dairy Commissioner Ben
nett, Mr. Griswold, Emmett Alex
ander und others. J. D. Robey pre
sided und again proved that he is a
splendid man at the head of the
Commercial Club, which has done
6uch good work for Monroe City.
Holy Rosary Seniors v Alumnae
The basket ball game between
the Holy Rosary Seniors and the
Alumnae, Friday afternoon was an
extremely interesting contest from
start to finish, so well were the
teams matched, and so reliable
were the guards in their work that
the ball was in play several
minutes before a score was regis
tered. At the end of the first half the
seniors were 4 and the Alumnae 2
During the second half each side
put 2 to their crew! it, leaving the
score at full time in favor of the
seniors, (i to 4.
No less interesting was the game
that followed, between Mabel
Kendrick's Honey Bees and Frances
Williams' Butterflies. Not an idler
was to be noticed among the busy
Bees but each willing worker did
her full share to bring home the
coveted sweets. Neither was there
a spectator among the Butterflies.
They played just as well, flitted
about just as much, but somehow
as might be inferred from their
name they could not make their
labor count as well in its result.
The Bees Anally captured the prize
by the score of 12 to 4. .

once and went to a resilience. A
woman was there but the dogs did
not stop. They followed on to the
railroad where party that was being
tracked had taken the train. They
are satisfied that they will have no
trouble locating the guilty party.
The dogs attracted a great deal
of attention. Many of the stores
were closed and a crowd followed
the dogs over the trail.
Sold 2000 bushel of Apples
Frank Gentry sold 2000 pushel
of apples off of his orchard this
fall. Mr. Gentry has had more fruit
and a better quality than almost
anyone else around here. The reason

apples you get quality as well as
good measure.
