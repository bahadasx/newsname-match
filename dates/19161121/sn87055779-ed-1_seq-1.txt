"Organized labor in the coming legal
battle over the eight-hour law is
going to remain an interested spec
tator on the side lines and watch
the railroads fight the government
under which they live."
This was the stand of the great
railroad brotherhoods, as outlined
today by Warren S. Stone, head of
the engineers, in an impassioned
plea to the American Federation of
Labor. Stone was followed by his
colleagues Shepard of the conduc
tors: Carter of the firemen, and Lee
of the trainmen, and they upheld
unequivocally the stand as outlined
by Ftone.
There was no hint of strike, in
the event the railroads succeed in
tying up the operation of the
Adamson law, contained in any of
the o?eches.
Hut te time has come, tone said,
when the railroads are on the de
fensive instead of labor, and he de
clnred "we have great faith that the
man in thp white house will see that
"we pet what was given us volun
tarily." Stone accused the railroads of
seeking to bankrupt labor by start
ing "H.OOO injunction suits"' through
out the country.
"They thought." said 'tone. "that
we would have to hire 3.000 law
yers to contest these suits. Hut we're
going to fool 'em. We're going to
watch the railroads tight the gov

Organized labor. Stone said, standi
united in this crisis and the 500 del
