Congressional Committee to
Make an Exhaustive,
Study of Matter
KR* FEDERAL OWNERSHIP
TO BE CONSIDERED
Washington, D. C., Nov. 20.-The
Joint congressional committee appoint"
ed to investigate a wide range of prob
lems relating to railroads and other
common carriers, held its first meet
J-* jng today. State railroad commission
crs were to be heard first, At ire
quent sessions during the next six
to"
r'
I weeks the commission expects to re
ceive the views of railway officials,
financiers] labor leaders, shippers,
heads of express, telephone and tele
graph companies and other students
of transportation problems. The com
mittee is to report on January 8.
Among those who planned to attend
the opening meeting was Warren S.
Stone, chief of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers. Representative
Adamson was to discuss prospective
railway legislation With President Wil
son today.
Newlands Explains.
In opening the first session of the
Joint congressional committee today,
Senator Francis G. Newlands of Neva
da, the chairman, explained that the
Inquiry would cover a wide field. He
"a"It will relate to every phase of the
transportation question, the rail car
riers, the river carriers and the ocean
carriers, and the perfection of a har
monious system of transportation, em
bracing rail, river and ocean carriers
that will meet the demands 'of inter
state'as well as foreign commerce and
it will also be applied to telegraph and
telephone lines, express companies
and other public utilities.
"It will embrace not only the sub
Ject of government control and regula
tions of these utilities, but also the
wisdom and the feasibility of govern
ment ownership ai^d the comparative
worth and efficiency of government
11
regulation and control as compared
with government ownership and oper
ation.
Need Sympathetic Aid.
"It will not be possible for us to
*,' come to a speedy conclusion regarding
all questions but that conclusion will
be more quickly arrived at if we have
the sympathetic aid of practical men
who for years have been conversant
with the practical side of the transpor
tation question, of the economists and
publicists, of railway executives and
workers of commercial bodies, farmers
and manufacturers, and shippers gen
crftlly*'
Referring to government ownership
Senator Newlands said:
"It is a question that must be faced.
Other
nations far advanced in civiliza­
tion have adopted the system. Recent
ly, under the stress of war, almost all
European governments have taken
over the railways. Whether that will
be a permanent taking over or only a
temporary one, it demonstrates that in
conditions of great crises when the
autocratic powers must be given to
government, all intelligent govern-
ments drift toward absolute and com
plete operation of the roads as the
only solution of the question.
Must Watch Europe.
"If we pursue the exercise and the
study of government regulation wisely,
persistently and energetically, wfe may
create such a system of regulation as
will meet every requirement, both in
time of peace and war and in exigency
or crisis. But it seems to be a wise
thing for the government of the United
States to ascertain now the history of
the countries that have adopted gov
ernment ownership and operation of
railways, and to watch the experiences
of the European countries in this great
war in this regard.
"In this connection will come the
question of the method of taking over
the railroads. Shall it be accomplished
by an actual valuation of the railways
and a condemnation of them, or shall
they be taken over by the easier meth
od of taking over the stocks and the
bonds at their market value, thus at
one step having the national govern
ment take the position of stock holder
and security holder of these great cor
porations?"
Strikes as a means of settling labor
disputes, Senator Newlands character
ized as "the most barbaric and brutal
of processes."
"Hours and wages of employes must
be considered carefully. Senator New
lands said, "because the burdens which
constitute the operating expenses of
these corporations are in time trans
ferred to the shippers."
Senator Newlands outlined the pro
posals to recognise the interstate com
\merce commission, and to create fed
eral agencies which might supplant
state authorities in exercising control
over railroad financing.
jfc There will also come up he said, the
question as to whether the nation or
the states should create the great traf
fic organizations that serve the pur-
1
pose of Interstate commerce.
Commenting on suggestions that
railroad taxation be put in the hands
of federal authorities exclusively, Sen
'. ator Newlands said:

GIRLS AVIATOR SETS
LONG TRIP RECORD
IS WARMLY GREETED IN NEW
YORK AFTER REMARKABLE
FLIGHT FROM CHICAGO.
New York, Nov. 20.—The record
breaking airplane flight of Ruth Law.
began yesterday in Chicago, terminat
ed at Governors island here at 9:40 a.
m. today after stops at Hornell and
Binghampton, N. Y. The final 152
miles from Binghampton to this city
was covered this morning in two hours
and twenty minutes and the entire
journey, 832 miles in an airline, the
actual flying time of nine hours and
one minute.
Mis3 Law was greeted on her arriv
al at Governor's island by Maj. Gen.
and Mrs. Leonard Wood, who congrat
ulated her on her achievement. She
was considerably chilled and was tak
en to the house of one of the officers
at the post to recuperate.
She had little to say about her flight
except that she had to fly much lower
than she wanted to. on account of the
haze. It was the cause of remark
among those who examined her ma
chine here that its structure was such
as to expose her to the air more than
in the case of most modern airplanes.
The pilot's seat is placed, on a projec
tion in front of the machine so that
the aviatrix gets the full force of the
wind.
The machine used by Victor Carl
strom, previous holder of the Ameri
can non-stop record established in a
flight November 2 from Chicago to
New York was of the fusillage type, in
the cockpit of which he was snugly
protected from the wind. In the pres
ent flight Miss Law bettered Carl
strom's record by about 100 miles,
making the 590 miles in an airline
from Chicago to Hornell, N. Y., where
she arrived yesterday without stop
ping.
DRY FIGHT OPENS
Association Begins Labors to Close
The Saloons of Chicago Bryan
Makes a Speech.
Chicago, Nov. 20—The Dry Chicago
campaign opened today when W. J.
Bryan addressed a meeting of the
"Dry Chicago Federation. Mr. Bryan
was asked as to a recurrence of the
report that he was to move his home
to Asheville, N. C.
"I don't mind denying it again," said
Mr. Bryan. "Why should anyone
leave a nice dry state liKe Nebraska?
We expect to spend our winters at
Miami, Fla., and part of our suhjmers
at Asheville but our home will remain
at Lincoln. I will do my voting there
and we will live there a part of each

MAY USE SAYINGS
FOR MODEL HOMES
Baltimore, Md., Nov. 20.— Congress
will be urged to pass legislation where
by money on deposit in the postal sav
ings bank may he loaned to municipal
ities for the purpose of building modei
homes for its citizcns, in accordance
with a resolution unanimously adopted
by the American Federation of Labor
convention today.
An alternative suggestion, contained
in the resolution is that the govern
ment shall establish such a system of
credits that the people may borrow
money for a long term of years, at a
lower rate of interest to build their
own homes.
All state federation of labor and or
ganized labor everywhere were urged
in an adopted resolution, to make the
Injunction question the paramount is
sue in all of their future political ac
tivities.
The action of the Chicago Board of
Education in dropping thirty-eight
teachers "in defiance of the superin
tendents' recommnedation" was con
demned in the resolution.

KEOKUK CLOSES
Real Stuff Is Found on Tap
at Most of Them During
Recent Inspection
Keokuk, Nov. 20. —The Keokuk city
council today revoked the licenses of
fourteen "Temp" barsi here, following
a conference of city, county and state
officials. Notice was served on proprie
tors that they must close at once, and
it was asserted, no new licenses would
be issued.
Revocation of the licenses, it was
stated, was resorted to "in an effort to
cope with continued violation of the
state liquor laws" which came to light
following an investigation conducted
here by operatives of the state depart
ment of justice. According to city of
ficials nearly all of the bars closed
were raided during the last two weeks
and in every case it was found that
liquor was being sold illegally.
I The revocation of the licenses will
result in the loss of considerable of
the city's revenue. Proprietors of
I "temp" bars were paying $75 a month
for the privilege of operating, under an
ordinance passed by the city council
I soon after the saloons were closed.
PRICE OF BUTTER
IS GOING UP NEXT
Chicago, Nov. 20. —There is every
reason to believe that the price of but
ter will continue to rise, according to
a statement made today by C. E. Mc
Neill, president of the Chicago Butter
and Egg board. Mr. McNeill asserted
that the board price probably will be
fifty cents a pound before the first of
the year "if the orders continue to
come in as they are now."
"The storage houses were cleared
when this season began," he said, ''and
the demand has been heavy. War or
ders, for butter itself, for condensed
milk, and cheese are partly respons
ible for the increased demand. I see
no indication of a diminished demand."
Inspectors of the U. S. department
of justice began efTorts to discover the
reason for the rising cost of butter
with investigations of the Chicago and
Elgin boards it was learned today. Mr.
McNeill said he had supplied one in
spector with figures as to the amount
of butter in storage. This, he said, is
about 10,000,000 pounds less than at
thjs time last year.
ITALIANS OBJECT
TO GERMAN MUSIC
Rome, via Paris, Nov. 20. —An at
tempt to introduce some of Wagner's
music into a concert conducted by Tos
canini resulted in an uproar last night
which brought the performance to a
premature conclusion. The orchestra
had commenced the funeral march
from Gotterdammerung when then?
were loud shouts of "it is for the vic
tims of Padua." A storm of impreca
tions against Wagner and Germany
came from all parts of the great audi
torium and the concert had to be
!abandoned.
(An Austrian aviator* bombarded
Padua on November 11 and, according
to news dispatches, killed thirty-two
persons and Injured about twice that
number. All the dead were said to be
non-combatants and most of them wo
men and children. Pope Benedict made
a strong protest to Vienna as a result
of the raid.
BRITISH WIDOWS
COMING TO CANADA
Chicago, Nov. 20. —thousands of
British war widows and their children
are to be transported to Canada with
the expectation that many of the wo
men will be married to Canadian far
mers, according to plans outlined here
today by David Lamb, of London, com
missioner of the International Emigra
tion society of the Salvation army.
Commissioner Lamb said he had re
ceived assurances of the support of
the plan from both the Canadian, and
the British governments.
Mr. Lamb said that the demand for
the privilege of such emigration is
such as to enable the army to select
only those suited physically and men
tally to be good colonists.
MODELS CAUSE OF
BI PANIC AT FIRE
Chicago, Nov. 20 —After five women
had been carried by firemen down lad
ders to safety from the roof of a burn
ing six story building in the downtown
district here today, hundreds of per
sons watching the blaze shrieked with
horror when as many more female
forms came plunging one by on*
through the air from the upper stories
of the burning building. The figures
struck the ground and lay inert while
the throng pressed around. But they
were dress models thrown out of a mil
linery establishment by the firemen in
fighting the flames.
ACCUSED BRIBER OF
JUROR ACQUITTED
Chicago. Nov. 20.—Albert C. Frost,
wealthy promoter Oliver W. Bourke
and Bert D. Wing, a lawyer, were
found not guilty of Jury bribing by a
jury in the federal court today. Frost

a juror In the BO-called 110,000,000
Alaska land fraud case of 1913, in
Frost was acquitted. Wing was

alleged to have been implicated in the
fraud.
S0MME THRUST IS
OVER SAY GERMANS
S
MILITARY CRITICS EXPRESS BE
LIEF THAT ALLIES ARE ABOUT
WORN OUT.
Berlin, Nov. 20.—(By wireless to
Sayville)—The military critic of the
Overseas News agency writes:
"The greatest thrust on the Somme
has come to a complete standstill. Last
week the general battle was split into
isolated attacks. The small local suc
cesses of the enemy could not be de
veloped and for the most part were
nullified by counter attacks. The fact
that for several weeks the same vil
lages have been mentioned again and
again in the official German reports
and those of the entente is the best
proof that thd general battle on the
Sommo has come to a standstill and
that the British as well as the French
are limited to improving their posi
tions.
"Although the British won small lo
cal successes near Grandcourt and
the German were again driven from
Serre, the coveted heights of Serre re
mained in German hands after a des
perate battle.
"Three fresh army corps were
brought up by the British for the great
attack of November 13-14, the objec
tive of which was not merely Beau
mont-Hamel and Beaucourt, but Ba
paume, as Is proved by orders that
were found. After the failure of the
mass thrusts isolated attacks were
continued by the British all through!
the week. These were without suc
cess and on Saturday the British again
made a general attack on b6th sides
of the Ancre. This new attempt to
break through our line was a complete
failure. On the 12-kilometer front the
enemy was repulsed almost every
where and his insignificant successes
at somo places required the heaviest
sacrifices. Local successes at the bend
of the Ancre was paid for by the Brit
ish with losses elsewhere on the front.
The Butte de Warlencourt, a hill
which bars the road to Bapaume which
was captured by the British on Novem
ber 14, at the expense of enormous sac
rifices, was recaptured by the Ger
mans on the 16th. A surprise attack
was made by the Germans without ar
tillery preparation and the opposing
troops fled. Only two non-commis
sioned officers and seventeen men
could be capture'd. The prisoners bore
no arms. They were Australians who
were most weary of war, and they de
clared that all the Australian troops
on the Somme front were kept up only
by the hope of speedy relief.
"Isolated attacks by the French
were equally unsuccessful. Near St.
Pierre Vaast wood, a French attack
broke down with heavy losses and
near Pressolre little was gained."
SERBS GIVEN CREDIT.
London, Nov. 20.—The Serbians are
given the lion's share of honor by the
morning papers in discussing the fall
of Monastir. The capture of hill 1,212
by the Serbians and their rapid ad
vance to hill 1,378, threatening the
Bulgarians' only avenue of retreat
along the Prilep road, is considered
the main factor in forcing the hasty
evacuation of the city.
Military opinion insists that the al
lies must now advance toward Prilep
using Monastir as a base, and. from
there to Negotin on the Vardar. From
the latter town they claim that the
Bulgarian positions east of the Cerna
could be outflanked and the frontier
passes opened to the allied
(forces
which are now engaged northwest of
Saloniki. The fall of Monastir is con
sidered as clearly showing the superi
ority of the allies over the German-Bui
gar forces in view of the formidable
defenses which had been created
around the city.
War Summary
The capture of Monastir by Gen
eral Sarrail's army in Macedonia
is looked upon by entente military
writers as of notable political Im
portance but opinion appears to be
divided as to whether it will be
followed by military deevlopments
of sweeping character.
Events of the next day or two
are expected to show whether the
pursuit of the retreating German
Bulgarian forces is to be pressed.
In some quarters an advance by
the entente forces along the road
to Prilep is forecast to be followed
by a thrust from Prilep toward
Negotin on the Vardar, with the
object of outflanking the Bulgar
ians and opening up the frontier
passes.
Following the demand by the
entente for the turning over of
virtually all the arms, artillery
and munitions of the Greek army,
it is reported today in a news
agency dispatch from Athens, that
the ministers of the Central pow
ers have been ^rdered by the en
tente authorities to leave Greece
by Wednesday.
The Austro-Genhan forces in
Transylvania have made prisoners
of 189 officers and 19,338 men and
captured 26 guns. 72 machine guns
and 17 ammunition cars.
Bad weather has slackened op
erations on the western front in
France, but the British have taken
additional German prisoners, mak
ing a total of 6,962 since Novem
ber 18. Berlin asserts that the
British met with a severe reverse
in the fighting over a seven mile
front last Saturday. They also
claim the French were repulsed.
'The Russian casualties since
June 1, last, have been 100,621 of
ficers and 2,027,853 men, according
to the Berlin Overseas News

AUTO GOES OVER
Fergusons Have a Narrow
Escape When Returning
From Visit in City
Ac accident which escaped being a
tragedy by almost a miracle occurred
late last evening when the car in
which Mr. and Mrs. James Ferguson,
children, Ruth and James, and Charles
Benning of Douds Leando, ran over
the edge of the road east of the Sugar
Creek bridge and somersaulted down
an embankment of nearly a hundred
feet. The party had been visiting rel

route home when they were blinded
by the lights of an approaching car.
Driving too close to the right along
a high place in the road toward Agen
cy, which is known as the old "right
of way," the wheels slipped over the
edge and the car turned over several
times in its downward flight. The
group escaped with bruises, scratches
and severe nervous shocks, and re
turned to this city for medical treat
ment. No bones were broken and it is
thought that they will be able to re
turn home soon.
BOMBS ARE FOUND
IN VESSEL'S CARGO
New York, Nov. 20.—Twenty unex
ploded bombs were found in the sugar
cargo o? the American steamship Sar
nia upon her arrival at Cherbourg,
France, after a voyage starting from
New York on September 2, during
which the vessel caught fire from an
unknown cause, according to Fourth
Mate Wybrance of the Sarnia, who ar
rived here today on the American line
steamship New York from Liverpool.
Sugar made up the bulk of the car
goes of the Sarnia and the barge
Avondale. which she had in tow upon
leaving New York. The fire at sea
was extinguished without serious dam
age, Wybrance said, and the two ves
sels put in at Havre to discharge part
of the cargo. It was not until they
reached Cherbourg that the sugar was
unloaded.
The Sarnia, before the war. was a
Hamburg-Ajnerican steamship and
since being transferred to American
registry were.cleared from New York
by J. Winchester & Co., shipping
brokers, and was owned by the Hud
son Bay Co. The sugar was consigned
to the French government.
IMMIGRANTS NOT
BEING WELCOMED
New York, Nov. io. —The United
States may become an "emigrant"
rather than an "immigrant" nation at
the close of the war, pred'ets Commis
sioner of Immigration Frederick C.
Howe. He bases his belief on the
ground that the Immigrant is not be
ing treated justly. In an address last
night he said that those who opposed
immigration d'd so because they desir
ed to limit the competition of unskill
ed foreign laborers: those who favored
the wide open door did so because It
made labor cheap.
The immi graft no longer went to the
farm, Mr. Howe said, because all of tho
available land of the country had been
taken up, hundreds of millions of acres
being held for purely speculative pur­|escape
poses.
"The immigration problem never ex
isted so long as the land was free for
the asking." said Mr. Howe. "And it
Is this scarceness of land which makes
immigration rin economic question."
Commissioner Howe urged the crea
tion of a fund by congress to be loaned
to immigrants so that they may estab
lish themselves on farms and asserted
that this was the only solution of the
immigration problem.

IOWANS NEED FEAR
NOTYPHUS EPIDEMIC
ITINERARY OF MEXICAN LABOR
ER WHO BROUGHT DISEASE
IS BEING TRACED.
Ft. Madison, Nov. 20.—Dr. Mark
Boyd, of the Iowa state board of
health, today began work of tracing
the itinerary of the Mexican laborer,
who brought typhus fever to Ft Mad
ison, before his arrival here. One
death from the disease has occurred
and there are four patients suffering
from typhus in the local hospital. All
four probably will recover, it was
stated today.
According to Dr. Boyd, the Mexican
was taken ill at New Boston, and
walked to Ft. Madison, remaining in
the local Mexican colony for several
days before he became so ill it was
necessary to send him to the hospital.
As typhus is communicable only
through the bites of vermin, it is be
lieved there is little,danger of contag
ion from any source save the bunk
cars in which the Mexicans live, and
these together with their occupants
have been thoroughly fumigated.
An investigation was started today
to learn whether the Mexican came to
New Boston via Dodge City, Kan.,
where typhus cases also were re
ported and whether he made any pro
longed stops en route.
