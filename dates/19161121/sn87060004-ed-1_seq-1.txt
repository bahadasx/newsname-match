'THE DUSKY BELIES"
At Temple Theater Saturday,
Night, Nov. 25 For
Benefit of Guild
Tbore will be something doing
at Tomplo Theater Siturday
night, Nov. 25. "The Dash
Belles" will be pat on in a home
talent play for the benefit qf St,
Margaret's Guild. The play will
"bo fall of laughs and fan and is
well worth the small prico of ad
mission. Seats are now on sale at Long's
Bakery at 85 and 50 cents. Jt
wonld bo a pood idea to reserve
your seats early as it is more
than probable the houe will be
crowded and the best seats will
go first.
The Shirk
Probably the most annoying, ex
asperating and altogether despisable
characters with which we mortals have
to contend is the shirk the man
who shunts his responsibilities onto
another's shoulders. The shirk is the
original "get something for nothing"
artist. Be is an adept at "using ' his
friends. Deis an expert at the' con",
game.
The shirk is frequently found as
sociated with important undertakings
How he ever got there is a mystery
How he manages (0 retain his place
is still a greater mystery. He never
voluntarily does a stroke of work
which he can by any hook or crook
persuade some credulous associate to
perform. He is forever devising
schemes by which to roll his own
responsibilities onto other shoulders.
He is ulterably devoid of a sense of
shame at his own deficiency and al
ways lias a ready excuse for his de
reliction.
However, in most cases he has one
redeeming quality lie is possessed of
unlimited good humor. Be has the
faculty of imposing on you till you
rise up in revolt, when heat once pro
ceeds to "jolly" you into a good
humor and into submitting to more
of his tyranny. He always professes to
believe in "bearing one another's bur
dens," but is generally preoccupied
with his own affairs when your bur
den begins to chafe.
Be is, in short, a cumberer of the
earth and occupies the room that a
good man should fill.
Every time we are thrown into
close touch with one of thisgentryvwe
disposed to doubt if the problem of
human slavery was rightly decided.
My I how we shonld like to' have the
directing of his. activities for just a
short while
But as that is out of the question,
we just go on quietly submitting to
his impositions.
Bow long will we continue to do so.

THE GULLIBLE
Uncle Sam hUs his troubles
protecting his gullible children
from tho sad consequences of
their open- mouthed hankering
after "sucker"bait.
For weeks past the Minneapol
is postouioo has been holding up
an avorago of 80,000 letters a day
each inclosing a dlmo, for which
the writer expected to receive a
silk petticoat, model 1017, worth
$4.75. Tho fly bynight who adver
tised this ridiculous offer hie
long since packed hiarjp and
taken his doparturo to regions
remote, with such coin as reach
ed him before Uncle Sam learned
of his dime-collecting scheme.
He used tho old, often exposed
chain letter system, by which he
expandod immensely the reach of
hit original, obscure advertise
ment. Every customer for petti
coats at 10 ceuts apiece was re
quired to write to five friends,
telling them of the great oppor
tunity, and to send their names
and addresses to tho promoter of
the enterprise.
Tho chain got a good start.
When it will end nobody knows.
Meantime the post office has em
ployed a force of extra clerks to
handle tho bushels of letters and
to return tho dimes to their fool
senders.
When will paople learn Mint
value costs money? That some
thing cannot bo had fornothin2?
That only swindlers off r $1 75
worth for a djme?
In tliis instance U14 individual
loss is small. Tho most sorious
aspect of the matter is the trouble
and expense to winch thogovern-
mcnt 13 put to sav its fool citi
zens from losjpg their dimes.
Bat tho folly that prompts the
venturiug of it dime ttn such a
proposition is tho same fojly (hat,
buysjfako mining stock patronizes
fuk) auction sales and lends
credulous oar to the persuasive
language of persons whose know
ledge of tinman nature's weak
ness is their sole stock in trade
Au.l back of it is the vicious
eagerness to m?t value without
adequate return.
The wise buyer pliys safe by
doaliug only with persons and
and firms of established reputat
ion whose names may be found
in th advertising columns ,of
newspapers that are scrupulous
as to the company they introduce
to their readers. LiukviHe

Word of Appreciation.
"I suppose you think a republic
Is ungrateful." "No," replied Senator
Sorghum; "this republic has always
treated me all right. And there have
been times, when f got to thinking
about what it hais to put up with, that
a republic' seems downright patient
and forbearing."

Pisgah National Forest
Federal Game Preserve
Washington, Nov. 16- President'
Wilson has issued a proclamation by,
which the Pisgah National Forest,
in Western North Caiollna, is made
a federal game preserve this is the
first federal game preserve of its
kind to be created east bfthe Mississ
ippi River.
The Pisgah National Forest con-,
siits largely of the George W. Van
deroilt estate, part of which has been
pnrchased by the Government. The
land is touted near Asheville and Bilt
more, N. C. Owing to the protection
against hunting which has been afford-'
ed the tract for a number of years, the
game has not been killed out, as is
the case in most places in the south
ern mountains. Deer, wild turkey and
pheasants are said to be plentiful,
After it is known that the tract
would be acquired by the government
many of the local citizens urged that
the protection to the game should be
continued. The North Carolina Legis
ure passed an act whereby the state
consented to the enactment br con
gress of laws for the protection of
game, birds and fish on any lands
purchased by the government under
the Weeks law in the Western part of
the state
As a game preseive, no hunting
will be allowed on the forest and as
the deer and other game increase on
the area, it is expected that the over
flow wilt drift out of the forest and
gradually restock adjacent lands. A
movement is now on foot to place a
herd of elk and one of buffalo in the
preserve this winter.
Regulations governing the camping
and fishing privileges have been drawn
up in cooperations with local citizens
and sporting clubs, and will be issued
by the secretary of agriculture. It is
understood that regulated fishing
wij)'be allowed, but the number of
permits issued the first season will be
purely experimental, since the capac
ity of the streams is not known.

Tragic
Deaths in
The Old Way
Automobiles, railroads and
street cars have ground up a lot
of peopleintne pist few years,
but the Census Department has
counted the victims, and has left
the pennaut with the gnn and
pistol contingent of society. The
consqs figures bring ont the
astonshing fact that during the
year 1015 firearms caused more
deaths than railroad accidents,
more man live times as many as
street car' accidents, nearly ns
many railroad and street car ac
cidents combined, and more than
twice as many as automobile ac
cidents. The totil number of
deaths due to the use of firearms
in the registration area in 1015
was 0,094. Nearly oue-third of
the 909,155 deaths reported for
1915 in tho registration area,
which tjontained approximately
07 percent of the population 'of
she entire United S'.atop, were
due to .three causes heart di
seases, tuberculosis and pneu
monia. Fire Destroys Collage

Cuban Lumber Imports.
Cuba imports annually about 0,000,-
000 feet of lumber. This consists, for
the most part, of pine, spruce, fir, and
Is imported In the form of Inch boards,
running from 0 to 12 Inches In width ;
planks two and three inches thick
and of various widths, and deals sawn
to various dimensions to conform to
orders received.
Bubble.
Bubbles are round because the air
which forms the lasldo of tho bubble
pushes with equal strength against all
parts of the thin film of water that
surrounds It. It presses equally
against the sides of tho bubble nt oil
times, so that If you blow more nlr
Into the lnclosure, the bubble will be
enlarged tho same amount all over,

To The Traveling Public
You are urgently requested to use
the entire road and not drive in the
same track all the the time as such a
procedure will cause the road to rut
and even though it might be only for
a small depth, water will run down
in the ruts and cause the roads to
deteriorate. A rut is very hard ta
repair especially until it gets to be
three or four inches deep,
The people should realize the fact
that they are .paying for the road,
themselves and should try to pre
serve same because it is their prop
erty. .It. Wiley,
