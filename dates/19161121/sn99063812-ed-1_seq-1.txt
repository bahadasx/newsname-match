Although, a, motion to Increase. the

meeting of the council, It Is expected
that Mr. Groeibeck .will be given
more pay while the added duties of
his office are necessitated by work of
building the Strahorn railroad by the
city.
The motion was made by Doty,
but after being lost another motion
to refer the matter to thetnance
