JUDGE TORRANCE
TELLS WHY HE
GUARDS CHAIR
The Minneapolis Tribune published
the following article Monday in re
gard to Judge Ell Torrance of Min
neapolis, father of Graham M. Tor
rance, county attorney of Beltrami
county.
The article follows:
"Presbyterian ministers of Minne
apolis received a quiet admonition
this morning that they should not sit
in the old wooden kitchen chair in
Judge Ell Torrance's office when
they have occasion to call on him.
The admonition includes the rest of
mankind.
'I keep a pile of books and papers
on that chair,' said Judge Torrance
at the ministers' meeting at the Y. M.
0. A., 'and when anyone shows a dis
position to sit on it I quickly lead
them to some other chair.'
"Judge Torrance in reminiscent
mood recounted why he kept this 80-
year-old chair in his offices amid the
mahogany furniture of pretentious
appearance..
"The chair was made by hisi father
when he was a. cabinet maker strug
gling to raise the money Whicli after
ward enabled him to study to become
a Presbyterian minister in Pennsyl
vania more than 80 years ago.
"What the chair typifies to him he
indicates1
In a brief account,of the old
home. It was first a dining room
cJwir and a6 frequently used fpr
morning prayers. Later it was rele
gated to the kitchen where his mother
resJted herself in the midst of'wdrk
and where she set the fresh baked"
lr**d
**fhe chair was purchased several
years ago by James Torrance Root at
the sale of the furnishings of the Old
Torrance home In Pennsylvania. Mr.
Root was a son of an elder in Mr.
Torrance's church and was named
after the pastor. There were two
chairs purchased and last Christmas
Mr. Root sent one to Judge Torrance
as a memento.
"Judge. Torrance told the ministers
that blue Monday w,as a good time to
think over the seven stages of the life
of the minister. He omitted one of
the seven, however. The six he gave
are as follows: 'At 25 years,' he said,
:the ^minister is, Scrutinized at 36
lfonhsed at 45 idolised at 55 criti
cised at 65 ostracised, and at 75
ehhbnlied.'"
