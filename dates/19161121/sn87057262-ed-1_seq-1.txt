Irhe German undersea freighter
Deutschland made her second start
tor her home port of Bremen at 2:35
this afternoon, escorted by two tugs
which were to accompany her to the
{three mile limit at the end of the
Itound.
To the accompaniment of cheers

The Deutschlan^d's helmsman,

stood cheering and waving "good

There was no secrecy incident to
the Deutschl&nd's departure.
Early in the day rumors were fly

INSIGNIFICANT FORCE
Not Enough Aviators or Aeroplane*
to do Much Good in
Case of ,War on,
America.
[By George Martin, Written for the
United Press.]
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.—Declaring
that the United States army and
navy are blind, Alan R. Haxley, pres
ident of the Aero Club of America,
today pointed to the record breaking
Chicago to New York flight of Miss
Ruth Law and other great strides re
cently shown in "the development ,of
aviation here as an indication that
"eyefe" for the country's fighting
forces are now available.
The development, however, has
been through private enterprise and
he declared failure of the govern
ment to increase its aerial forces
would be a "menace to our national
security."
"We lack two thousand aeroplanes,
a dozen dirigibles and 126 kite bal
loons for observation, work. We
lack them as needed national de
fenses and to place this country
aerially where it belongs," said Haw
ley. "The head of the British admir
alty, Lord Balfour, recently said
what might well be needed by us:
avails England nothing to
have control of the sea unless it also
has control of the air.'
"The splentlld records recently
made by Miss Law, Carlstrom, border
fliers and others In private enter
prises, prove that it is not lack of
good aeroplanes and aviators that
keeps our army and navy blind.
"While half a dozen other coun
try have between two thousand and
nine thousand aviators each and
twice as many aeroplanes, our army
and navy combined have only about
-one hundred flying men.
"The forty-five batteries of field
artillery and the seventy-three forts
in the six coast artillery districts
have not a single aeroplang, dirigible
or observation balloon. They are
blind and the territory which they
should protect would be at the mercy
of the long range -guns of vessels ly
ing beyond the point of vision of the
artillery observers stationed In the
forts. Hundreds of millions of dol
lars are invested in these coast de
fenses and field artillery which
would be Ineffective without aerial
eyes.
"In these days of trans-Atlantic
submarines, eyes for our navy are
absolutely necessary. A chain of aer
ial stations should be established
throughout the country. Each of our
thirteen coast naval districts should
have a station."

PREPARE INDUSTRIES
Railway Problem la One Domestic
Issue Confronting Country, to
.Be Mentioned In
Message.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Stpff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.—A call to
American business to meet unpreced
ented trade conditions after the war,
is to be the keynote of President Wil
son's message to congress Tuesday,
December 5. The president is com
pleting the message today and expects
soon to have it in the hands of the
printer.
The president believes the coun
try's Industries can do a maximum
amount of wortt only when there is a
minimum, of industrial unrest. His
message is expected to emphasize this
in an appeal to employer and employe
for more cooperation, more confidence'
of each in the other and less tendency
to class feeling.
In this connection the president has
formulated plans for rendering prac
tically impossible strikes of all kinds.
He will urge completion of a-program
similar to that proposed in his last
message to handle such situations as
the recent threatened strike of the rail
way brotherhoods.
Believing the railway problem as
important a domestic issue as con
fronts the country, the president will
urge congress to give the most careful
consideration to possible legislation
which will aid the transportation sys
tems to expand and improve to meet
the additional stress under which they
will be placed at the close of the war.
Abroad als6 the. foundations must
be laid for the coming trade upheaval,
the president believes. He will urge
congress to act immediately upon a
measure along the lines of the Webb
bill, which would have permitted Am
erican exporters to organize without
fear of anti-trust, law action.
In addition to these, the president's
message will urge action upon differ
ent measures recommended in his
message of a year ago, and which are
still on the list of the administration's
unfinished business." They are ex
pected to include: conservation laws.

LOSS OF LIFE
IS HEEDLESS
War Has Now Reached That
Pitiful Stage When Men
Are Dying Uselessly
by Thousands
RETURN TO MONASTIR
The. King of Serbia Can Come Back
and Set Foot Again
Upon Native
8oll.
[By William G. Shepherd, written for
the United Press.]
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.—A year ago,
In the ruck of miserable humans, I
made my way across the wet fields
that led to the railroad station at
Monastir, boarded a train and fled
from Monastir with the Serbians.
"When are the English coming to
help us?" the Serbians had asked
pathetically for many days. But the
.English didn't come. For tome mys
terious reason they remained in their
scores of thousands at Salonika, two
hundred miles away.
To the north of us, somewhere in
the mountains, we knew that the
king of Serbia with his court, was
fleeing as we were. We knew that
the Serbian people, men, 'women and
children were moving In a cavalcade
of misery from their native land.
And the English haven't come yet
to Monastir. But the Serbians have
got there. Again the king of Serbia
will place his feet on Serbian soil.
There is little doubt that the news
dispatches within a short. time will
tell of the re-entry of the Serbian
king to his own country.
The cost had been undoubtedly a
huge one. There has been
no-vainer
loss of life, aside from that in the
Verdun contest, than the loss of men
about Monastir. It cost the Bulgars
thousands of men to reach Monastir.
They have held it a year, without
finding it of any strategic value:
they lost it agairi, with considerable
loss and the Serbian losses in re
gaining it must have been heavier.
Monastir proves that the losses in
the great war are becoming more
and more useless as the war goes
on. The lines do not break, they
only sway. But in the useless slay
ing, thousands of men die like germs.
The Serbians feel repaid, undoubt
edly for their sacrifices in regaining
Monastir. But the neutral world,
where sanity remains, ought to be
gin to see, in the Monastir incident,
the fact that has long "been appar
ent: Men are dying uselessly by the
hundreds of thousands. The war has
at last reached that pitiful stage.

The Third Winte'r.
[By J. W. T. Mason written for the
United Press.]
NEW YORK, Nov. 21—Three of
fensives are now at 'the height of
their pressure as the European con
flict enters its third winter. For the
first time since the war began the
military situation suggests a continu
ation of active fighting through the
zero months.
The Anglo-FYench offensive along
the Somme and the Ancre: the allied
advance along the Greek frontier, and
the Teuton movements in Rumania, all
contain possibilities of winter sur
prises. The principal unknown prob
lem that the winter may sojve is the
effect of intense artillery Are when
concentrated upon the frozen trenches
Since the start of the conflict there
has been no effort to test the ability
of either side to withstand an inex
haustible trench bombardment under
conditions of semi-numbness which
winter enforces upon the combatants.
Hithertp trench fighting has slack
ened largely into a winter draw with

AWAIT COURT DECISION
Last Week It Was Announced a* Cer

Decision la in
Doubt.
[By Carl D. Groit, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
WASHINGTON, Nov., 21.—A gen
eral railroad strike January 1 may
not follow as the result of the pres
ent situation growing out of the
Adamson law dispute.
This Interpretation was placed to
day on remarKs of Chief Stone, of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers, that the question of such a
strike "will be answered later." The
element of, doabt regarding his re
marks arises from the fact that last
week In New York, brotherhood
chiefs flat-fooiedly said there would
be a strike if they did not. get a real
eight hour day.
Now it is believed the brotherhoods
will be content to await a te*t of
constitutionality of the Adamson
eight hour measure. The brotier
hoods, however, are shroilding their
movements in an even deeper se:*ecy
than that which marked their pro
gram when they threatened to strike

of justice and the brotherhoods' legal
department are ready for the open
ing of thie Adamson tests Thursday
when the Union Pacific and Santa Fe
start their suits at Kansas City.
The course taken by the crew In
these cases' will be vital and upon its
action will probably rest the final de

whether there shall be a strike.

"Unfinished Business."
BALTIMORE. Md., Nov. 21.—
"There's going to foe an eight hour day
on the railways—or there's some un
finished business before this country."
In this manner today. Warren S.
Stone, head of the brotherhood of lo
comotive engineers, answered the
question whether the railway brother
hood will call a strike if pending in
junction proceedings tie up the oper
ations of the Adamson eight hour law.
Speaking in response to an enthus
iastic welcome given himself and the
heads of three other brotherhoods by
the delegates to the American Feder

clared
"Labor will watch from the side
lines while the railroads fight their
own government."
Efforts to obtain from the other
brotherhood leaders an expression of
their purpose in the matter were fruit
less, notwitshtanding President Gom

perts here today agreed this was the
only step which could be relied upon
to lessen the weight of General Von

admitted constitutes the grayest
