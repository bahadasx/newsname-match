Big interdenominational problems
facing the entire world, and the for
ward movement in religious education
in the present day, together with the
part that Methodism must play in
solving the situation of present-day
conditions formed the central points!
of five big addresses this morning by
men nationally known for their ac
tivity in church advancement.
What America is to do with her
wealth, gotten through the European
war? How to properly train and edu
cate the young men and women of
to-day? How to bring the spiritual
training more in the schools? What
is to be done to gire the millions of
young people an opportunity for bet
ter educational facilities? The pres
ent social service and labor problems?
Immigration? Prohibition? These l
are only a few of the many big points
touched upon and forcefully presented
to 2,500 enthusiastic Methodist laymen
this morning and this afternoon in the
Chestnut street auditorium.
All day speakers of national repute,
who have spent years in study and
survey at the head of big church
branch organisation work, devoted
hour after hour to continuous discus
sions and addresses to the Methodist
laymen. Interspersed with music and
prayer the long sessions proved to he
a big church service with lectures, 1
sermons, and educational talks that! 1
will undoubtedly have a powerful in
fluence in church work in the State,
particularly in Methodist circles.

Willcox Denies Hughes
Ever Had Prepared
Congratulatory Message
New York, Nov, 81, Chairman
William R. Willcox of tha Republican
National Committee, took cognizance
to-day of reports that Charles Evans
J lushes had prepared a message of
congratulation to send to President
Wilson conceding his re-elcctlon, but
hatl withheld it on the advice of Re
publican leaders, by denying that any
such communication had ever been
prepared. He said tho reports were
"founded on nothing but smoke."
Mr. Willcox came to Republican
national headquarters here from |
T.ukcwood where he and Mr. Huhes
have been taking a rest from their
campaign labors. He reiterated his
previous statements that the time had
not yet arrived for the Republicans
to concede the election to President
Wilson, nor would he make any fore
cast as to when a detinite statement
in that regard might be expected
either from him or Mr. Hughes. He
said that even When the official count
in California is known, thero might
still be conditions in other close States
keeping the final result in doubt.

Mexican Commissioners Given
Last Opportunity For Amica
ble Solution of Problems
WILL WITHDRAW LATER
But Not Until Border Is Ade
quately Protected by Gar
ranza; Cabrera Objects
| Atlantic City, X. J., Nov. 21. The
[ American commissioners to-day gave
to the Mexican commissioners what is
understood to be the lust opportunity
for an amicable settlement of the
problems that have urisen because of
>Carranxa'B failure to provide adequate
protection for life and property along
the lr.ternat**mi border.
In joint session, Secretary of the
Interior Lane, as chairman of the
American commission, informed Mr.
Carranza's representatives that the
American punitive expedirtou would
be withdrawn within a reasonable
time and under conditions that would
not impair the dignity of the Ameri
can government or leave unprotected
the territory Just south of the border
now patrolled by the Americans.
Incident to such withdrawal he out
lined the manner in which the Am
erican government was prepared to
guard the long line of frontier and
to run down and punish any maraud
ing band that attempted a crossing
into the T'nited States. He made it
clear to the Mexicans that this gov
ernment would not tolerate anv re
strictions on the pursuit of bandits by
American troops.
How Luis Cabrera, chairman of the
Mexican commission and his col
leagues received what is regarded as
the last word of the American com
missioners, was not expected to bo
known until after the session came
to an end this afternoon. Steady op
position to the plan by Mr. Cabrera
and continued insistence that further
activities of American troops in
Mexico must be restricted in various
ways have marked the conferences
of the joint commission for many
weeks and it was the apparent deter
mination of the Mexicans not to yield
that caused Mr. Lane to place before
I resident Wilson all the facts in the
case. When hp went Into the confer
ence room this morning he carried
with him the assurance of the Presi
ho had unqualified backing
of hjs plan. The Mexicans were
aware of the President's attitude and
it was regarded as probable that they
would recede from the position they
had taken.

for a commission to observe the opera

Council, at Commissioner Bow
i man's Suggestion, Wants
Solicitor's Opinion
Council at the suggestion of City
! Commissioner Harry F. Bowman,
head of the water and lighting de
partment. to-day asked the city solici
tor's opinion on the question of wheth
er or not Harrisburg can use enough
of the surplus earnings of the water
department to pay for the electric
lighting of the streets.
,The action followed a brief debate
on the issue which had been raised by
Mr. Bowman in answer to Mayor K<
S. Meals' announcement a few days
ago that he believes the city could
readily convert the water surplus to
pay the lighting bill and thus lop
some $68,000 to $70,000 annually from
the budget appropriation. Thfs would
mean reducing the tax rate by at least
a mill and a quarter.

GERMANS SWEEP j
INTOWALLACHIA
BY BOLD STROKE
Capture Large Section of Coun
try From Rumanians Who
Retreat 40 Miles
FACE EN V ELOPME X T
Teutons Before Craiova;
French and Serbs Still
Chasing Bulgars
By bold and rapid strokes the Teu
tonic Invaders apparently have con
quered a large section of Northwestern
Wullachia from the Rumanians.
Petrograd's official bulletin to-day
announces a Rumanian retirement in
this part of the battle front to the re
gion of Fllliash, forty miles northwest
of Craiova. Judging from the recent
reports of the operations, this means
that converging attacks by Austro-
C.erman forces moving southward In
the Jtul valley and eastward along the
railway from Ossova have compelled
the Rumanians to withdraw from the
Osova region and execute a rapid re
treat in the Jiul valley. This move
was made, It appears, to prevent the
retreat of their armies from being
cut off.
Whether even the rapid retreat indi
cated was in time to save the Ruma
nian armies in this region is rendered
doubtful by ihe German announce
pient that Teutonic troops are now be
fore Craiova. The railroad running
through Craiova to Bucharest affords
the only convenient line of retirement
for the Orsova and Jiul valley armies.
| While the Rumanians have evidentlv
] reached the junction point of the Jiul
-valley road with the main line at
| Filllash, the loss ot' Craiova would
| effectually bar their way eastward, ex
| cept across country.
Reinforced ill Kast
Farther eastward in Wallachla the
. arrival of Russian troops seems to
| have strengthened the Rumanian
! defense. The Russians took the offen
sive north of Campulung, according to
I Berlin, but were repulsed. The Ru
! manlans are resisting persistently In
! the Alt valley, south of Rothenthurm
| Pass, but nevertheless were compelled
to yield important positions to General
von Falkenhayn's troops.
Chasing Bulgarians
In the other chief field of present
military activity, the Macedonian
front, French and Serbian troops are
continuing their pursuit of tlie Ger
man and Bulgarian forces which evae
j uated Monastir under entente ■ pres
sure. Berlin reports the entente ad
vance as a "feeling out" of the Ger
manic-Bulgarian positions by recon
noitering detachments. The "new line
is indicated by press dispatches to lie
about seventeen miles northward of
Monastir and is reported to be stronglv
entrenched and flefended in part by
fresh German forces.
East of the Monastir region, Berlin
declares, Serbian attempts to advance
were repulsed. West of Monastir the
Kalians, according to Paris, repulsed
a counter attack.
On the Somme and Ancre fronts
I in Northern France the fighting has
j been conlined to artillery engagements.
| WORN-OUT STKKIJ NOW WORTH
MORE THAN NEW YEAR AGO
| Youngstown, Ohio, Nov. 21.—The
j price of steel has advanced so rapidlv
j that worn-out material is now more
| valuable than the new was one year
ago. The Mahoning and Shenango
; Street Railway Company has sold
worn-out steel rails in use (or years
at a higher price than is being'paid
bv the company for new rails to re
place those discarded. This situation
results from the fact that (he company
ordered the new rails one year ago.
EARTHQUAKE RECORDED

Was reported to-day by the George

Harrisburg, Pa., Nov. 21.
Cheers for "Brumbaugh and local

respects it was the most remark
able ever known on the "Hill."
Tho delegates marched to the
State House and were grouped in
the Governor's reception room,
overflowing into the corridor.
When the Governor appeared, some
one started cheers for him and for
several minutes there were cheers
for the Governor and various is
sues which he had espoused. The
Governor shook hands with the
bishops and Justice E. A. Walling
and then the delegates formed a
circle about him and sang hymns,
their voices carrying all over the
building and attracting many
clerks and officials. Each person
shook hands with the Governor and
was greeted by him. The delegates
filed out singing and were then
photographed in front of the Cap

in the way of enacting compensation

to the "spirit of cheerfulness shown
by employers in the working out of

statutes. He said that the State owod
a debt of gratitude of- them and so
