hat there was not a competent man
t the Deutschland's wheel; that the
ubmarine approached closer t.;> the

he Deutchland failed to have the

hat she failed to back when the tug
oomed close ahead, and that the oficer
in charge failed properly to calulate
the current.
An interesting phase of the proeedings
is that, if the matter goes
nto court, the exact building cost of

ler cargo may be brought out.
Captain Hinsch of the Eastern Forwarding
company, who was the only

was out of bed for the first time this

THINKS TIME NEAR
TO CONSIDER PEACE
WILSON MAY HE MEDIATOR
|
Says Rumania Was Allies' Last
Card and it Is Proving
a Failure.
Berlin, Nov. 18.? (Via London.?
Delayed.)?The opening of peace negotiations
may perhaps be expected
I with fair prospects of success in the
course of the coming winter, accord-j
ing to Count Albert Apponyi, veteran
Hungarian leader and former |
Hungarian premier. Count Apponyi,
I who is visitine (!crm!lnv tn <lnllv,.T
?,, -? ?
addresses on Hungarian history, exI
pressed his view given to a corres!
pondent of the Associated Press, in
'which he addressed the general European
situation.
"We cannot expect," he said, "to
see peace negotiations opened within
the next few weeks while the Rumanian
campaign is still undecided.
However, I regard our chances for
success there as excellent and once
Rumania is crushed I think both
'sides will be willing to consider tho!
question of peace. Rumania was the)
Entente's last card and is proving a
losing one. We are massing a big
army against the Rumanians and 1 i
think the end will come shortly. Of
j course, our progress on.the Transyl-I
jvanian front is a bit slow owing to
the great difficulty of the country j
jand particularly to the deficiency in
rearward communications'. They are
poorer than in the west or even in I
Gaiicia and Russia. However, the
entry of Rumania into the war has
in many respects been really advan
Itageous to us."
I
Recent Speeches.
To illustrate what he regards thai
improving chance for' peace negotia*
tlons Count Apponyi referred to reJj
cent speeches of statemen in the^opjposing
camps. "Not Llpyj^. Georg^j
of course," he interpected parenthet-;
ically, but such as Lord Grey and
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg,
for example.
He suggested a comparison be
intrcji me uiiciiiiii.es oi mese icau
iers a year ago and at present.
|"Then," he said, "their respective
standpoints were as far apart the
poles, but now although there are
still differences between them, they
have most appreciably drawn nearer.
The references to crushing Germany
have been eliminated from the British
pronouncements and the agitation
ifor annexation is dwindling in Germany.
IgninM Annexation.
"Chancellor Von Ilethmann-Ilollweg,"
he went on, "has pointed out
in bis latest speeches that he has
never demanded the annexation o?
Belgium. Such instances as these
show, in my opinion, that there are
now no really inseparable obstacle
to the opening of a discussion on future
peace. Of course, the Kingdom
of Poland must stand, but I believe
Russia con be brought to reconcile
herself to this situation."
Count Apponyi was asked if he
thought the impulse to start peace
discussions could come from within
the camps of the warring powers or
whether an outside impetus, in the
fofm of a tender of good offices from
.a neutral personage or power would
' be necessary. lie replied that be
saw no reason why neutral mediation
should not he welcomed when the op
portune moment to which he had re-:
ferred should arrive and added that
fhe knew no reason why President
Wilson should not he acceptable as
an intermediary.
Attitude Toward Wilson.
"We feel of course, he said, "that
President Wilson has not treated us
fairly and that he has departed from
the way of strict neutrality. But
even though one does not like a person
that is no reason for rejecting his
services when these may be useful."
The Hungarian statesman believes
that the war shouldvpot only end because
of what he regards as the futility
of further hostilities, but because
of his expressed conviction as
to the menace of Russia. He declared
that the western States of Europe
must band themselves together
for defense against Russia, which
country he characterized as the grent
menace to the future peace of Europe
and the world. In his opinion
France's efforts to regain AlsaceLorraine
are doomed to failure and

Rock Hill, Nov. 19.?James l'oag',1
| McMurray, cashier of the Loan and |
Savings bank of York, was almost in
'stantly killed tonight shortly before
'9 o'clock as a result of a collision.
jThe rear end of his automobile 1
struck a horse and Mr. McMurray
was found a few minutes later sitting '
with his hands on the steering '
wheel, breathing his last.
Mr. McMurray with his brother,
Joe McMurray of Hock Hill, had '
spent the day with their father at '
Fort Mill and he was en route to his 1
home in York.
The accident occurred just beyond |'
Winthrop college, where the road 1
takes a sharp turn, the automobile !
meeting a negro in a buggy coming l J
to Hock Hill. The front of the 111a-I
Chine passed safely, hut the rear 1
struck the horse, breaking a leg of 1
the animal, smashing the right front
wheel and damaging the rear of the
machine. T^ie negro was thrown
out, but not seriously hurt. The machine
was found some 100 feet farther
up the road, with Mr. McMurray ]
sitting in his natural position.
Dr. T. It. Carothers. who lives
nearby, was summoned and found
Mr. McMurray breathing his last. The is
seventh rib on the right side was s
broken. Death was evidently caused j<
by contact with the steering wheel. ;

MAYOR JONES R

As To Watter Issue, H
Matter By M
Lancaster News:
Newspaper controversies usually
degenerate into trivialities, or worse,
to the disgust of the intelligent public.
This is forcibly illustrated in
Mr. R. E. Wylie's last article in
which he shoots this paper wad, the
strongest argument he has as yet
brought forward on the water question.
Quoting: "The mayor insists
that the animous of Mr. Wylie still
shows itself. We are not ramiliar

We admit this does stun us. but
throughout this controversy we have
itndeavored to give Mr. Wylie instruction
and we will not in this hast
mergenoy fail to enlighten him. i
"Animous" is an old adjective now
obsolete, but found in all standard
liotionaries and defined as meaning

VYLIE'S ARTICLE
Je Says "We Pass The

would not intentionally impute to
Mr. Wylie. The word we intended to
UBS (with all due deference to the
typist and proof reader of The News)
was "animus," so well known and
understood by all lawyers, except Mr.
Wylie. in one snecifio spnsp moarm
a bad intention or disposition. If we
must paraphrase its intended meaning
by reference to some animal we j
would say of "Animus"?"It is a
wily biped of bad disposition hntT
fond of notoriety.
There is nothing new In Miv
Wylie's last article and nothing relevant
which has not already been fully
