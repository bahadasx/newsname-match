Berkshires Coining Fast
Association Increases Capital Stock
To Broaden Scope
.
At a meeting held here Monday,
the Kentucky Red Berkshire Asso
ciation increased its capital stock
from $300 to $1,000. A formal
vote of the stockholders was requir
ed for such action and amended arti
cles of incorporation will be filed in
the office of the County Clerk here
and the office of the Secretary of
State at Frankfort. The Association
has done a great work since its or
ganization and the members have
succeeded beyond their expectations
in bringing before the public gener
ally and farmers and hog breeders
in particular the merits of the Red
Berkshire as a general purpose hog
of the highest type. The demand
for breeding stock of this animal has
grown so that it is hard to supply it
and 'the members feel that by broad
ening the scope with increased capi
tal and ,more stockholders, great
progress 'can. be made during the
coming season.
Big Fire At Pineville
Disastrous Because
Supply Was Cut Off
Wate
Shortly after midnicrht Sunrinv the
office, storeroom und lumber sheds
of the Rice Lumber Company at Pine
ville were destroyed bv fire together
with the residence of R. B. Rice. On
account of lack of water the loss was
total. The Pineville water company
recently was indicted on evidence
furnished by the State Board of
Health and was charged with furnish
ing its patrons with polluted water.
The case went to trial Thursday of
last week and Saturday afternoon the
jury returned a verdict, fining .the
company one cent. The company of
ficials at 10 o'clock Saturday night
shut down the water plant leaving
the city without water for either pub
lic or domestic use.
As a consequence, when the fire
alarm was sounded there was no wa
ter on hand to fight the fire. Later
the water was turned on, but not un
til the property of the lumber com
pany had been destroyed. However,
other property which cautrht. firo wn
saved. The water company is under
contract to Pineville to furnish wa
ter for fire protection, and thn enn.
tract was in force when its plant was
shut down.
It is said those who lost in the fire
will bring suit against thp water
company to recover the. amount of
their losses'. Pineville was without
water and great inconvenience has
been experienced, esnecinllv hv lintels

Ihe companv was chartered, by the.
" .r- a
legislature and began operations
aoout lSUu. It is practically owned
by D. B. Logan, of Pineville, and
Louis Descognets, of Lexington.
The Joss of the Rice Lumber Com
pany is estimated at $1,000, with
small insurance. R. B. Rice's loss on
residence is $1,200 with insurance of
$700. The Hurst livery stable suf
fered damage to the amount of about
$300. The City Council met in extra
ordinary session late Sunday after
noon and an agreement was reached
with the company and the water ser
vice was again resumed at 5 o'clock.

Gives Up Political Job
Capt.
Joe L. Coffey To Go On Road
For Big Lead House
Capt. Joe Lynn Coffey, Avho has
been clerk of the Frankfort peniten
tiary for several years last week ten
dered his resignatipn to the Board of
Prison Commissioners and will ac
cept a nice position on the road for a
large lead manufacturing house the
first of December. Capt; Coffey, his
wife and young son spent Sunday
here with his father, Col. Joseph Cof
fey and was congratulated by his
many friends "back home" upon re
ceiving such a desirable" position, and
getting away from a purely apolitical
place. Capt Coffey has a faculty of
making friends, and is a good mixer.
He has made one of the most effi-
cient clerks the that prison ever had,
ana nis place will be hard to nil. It
is probable that he will travel through
the south considerably, having his
headquarters in Cincinnati, where the
main factory of his house is located,
and being compelled to make his
home at some point in Ohio.
The Prisqn Board has not yet an
nounced the name of the successor
to Capt. Coffey. Friends of June
Givens, son of Col. B. W. Givens, of
the Hubble section, are urging him
for the place. The board will appoint
whomever Gov. Stanley suggests to
it, and the governor wilk certaihjy
reward a faithful friend, 'who has led
his fight and stood to him at "all
times, by appointing the spnof Mr.
Givens to the place, for which his
name has been mentioned. Young
Givens is a fine young- man, and is
well qualified for the clerkship. The,
position pays' $100 a month.

Protect The Pheasants
Says Game Warden Embry, Who
, Says They've Multiplied Fast
. District Warden Sam J. Embry re
turned late last week from Casey,
where he put in the week seeing that
the game laws are enforced. Just before-
going to Casey he caused the
arrest of Arthur Hopkins, of the Crab
Orchard section for hunting without
license. Hopkins was released on $50
bail, which he furnished. Warden
Embruy is certainlv on to his inh nt
all times, and is making Violators of
the game laws live hard.
He is especially anxious for the
protection of the English pheasants,
which have shown up fine in their
breeding results during the year and
a half since they have been liberated
in this section. Reports to the Game
Warden are that these birds have
multiplied until there are three or
four times as many as were original
ly turned out. The penalty for killing
any of them or having them in pos
session, is very severe.
I The best hunting season since the
creation of the commission is the pre
diction of J. G. Ward, executive agent
of the Kentucky Game and Fish Com
mission, concerning the hunting sea
son, which opened last Wednesday.
"There will be a chance for a mixed
bag, Hyhich is pleasing to the average
sportsman," said Mr. Ward. "I don't
khowf when quail has been so plenti
ful and well distributed and there
are manv rabbits, jacksnipes and

Revival services at the Stanford
Baptist church opened most auspi

religion, straight from the
shoulder, with no compromise with

In opening the services Sundav
morning he talked on "Old Time Re

gregation that taxed the capacity of
the building, as the other churche's of
town, dismissed, he took as his sub
ject. "Sin Is Like Fire," and devel
oped some splendid thoughts during
the discourse. Monday morning at
10 o'clock his subject was "Backslid

First Baptist church, at Paducah.
Rev. J. W. Porter, of Lexington re

chard. EMBRY SHOWS UP WELL.
If Centre College had used Sam J.
Embry, of Stanford, at left end all
during the game ajrainst Transylva
nia University last Friday afternoon,
the Danville boys might have won the
game instead of only holding the T.
U. eleven to a 0 to 0 game. The Cen
tre coach, with a painful lack of
speed on his squad, kept Embry, a
100-yard record man, and a real live
wire on the bench until the latter
part of the last quarter. Arnett, the
big star for T. U., nearly won the
game by himself, yet the first scrim
mage Embry got into after he was
put in the line-up, he broke through
interference and threw Arnett be
hind his line. A great crowd was
present, and it was a finely fought
game from start to finish.

Keenon Vindicated
By
Unprecedented Democratic Ma
jority For Wilson This Year j
Clerk of the Court of Appeals Rod
man W. Keenon, of Frankfort, spent
Sunday in Stanford, with his brother-in-law,
Dr. T. W. Pennington. Mr.
Keenon who is one of the most popu
lar state officials at Frankfort, at
tained state wide notoriety recently
by his refusal to submit to the Stan
ley whisky ring's demands that it
be allowed to name all of the county
election commissioners in the state.
How well Mr. Keenon's judgment and
action in this matter was vindicated
is shown by the reVurns from the re
cent election in Kentucky when this
state gave Wilson, the largest demo
cratic majority in a presidential race
in a quarter of a century. Mr. Keenon
has been widely congratulated and
commended for the nerve and back
bone he displayed on that occasion,
and his friends are saying that noth
ing is too good for him, should he
ask any further honors from his par
ty. Before leaving Frankfort, he called
a meeting of the State Election Com
mission of which he is chairman for
November 21 for the purpose of can
vassing the returns of the election of
November 7.
Although 11 counties have not re
ported their official vote, the 110
counties that have reported show that
the vote of both parties cast this
year is largely in excess of that cast
in 1912.
The counties that have not report
ed officially are Henderson, Marion,
Kenton, Clark, Rowan, Knott, Perry,
Clay, Laurel, Pulaski and Whitley.
The Republican vote in Todd county
is missing.
The total vote for Wilson returned
so far is 239.575 votes, as against a
vote of 219,584 in 1912. The total
vote for Hughes so far is 211,728,
as against a vote of 218,279, the com
bined vote of the Progressives and
Republicans in 1912. The indications
are that the vote this year will ex
ceed the vote of 1908, which totaled
479,803.
TROUBLE AT THE MOUNTAIN
Richard Hatter, wiio lives at King's
Mountain and works for the Q. & C.
was in town Monday. Asked about
the trouble he had with "Dock" Pad
gett, of his town, a few nights ago
he said: "Some two years ago Dock
Padgett told me not to speak to him
again and I have always 'passed him
up since. Un bunday night, 121::, he
overtook me on the streets of King's
Mountains and began to beat me with
his pistol, saying he was going to
kill me. He shot at me several times
but missed me and we grappled. I
tried to get hold of his pistol, when
the weapon went off again, the ball
making a -f.tosh woamL-in-in v-- hip. A
man named'Lane came up about that
time and separated us. I -guess Pad
gett would have killed me if I had
not caught his hand in which he held
the weapon." Mr. Hatter was taken
before the grrnd jury but of course
this paper does not know what actio 1
was taken.
