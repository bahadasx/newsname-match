Big Fund Raised To Defend Eight
Hour Legislation
Reported
(United Press.)
Washington, Nov. 21.—No deci­
sion has been made by the rail­
way brotherhoods whether they
will strike if the Adamson Eight
Hour law fails to meet with their
demands when applied by the
Railroads.
President Stone, head of the
engineers, declared last week
that a strike would foliow if the
men did not get a real eight-hour
day. This reversal is perplexing
labor leaders and rail heads.
It is considered certain that the
brotherhoods will be content to
await a constitutional decision of
the Adamson law. In speaking be­
fore the American Federation of
Labor, in session at Baltimore,
the brotherhood chiefs maintained
absolute silence on this phase.
By BASIL M."MANLY.
Haliimnre, Mil.. Nov. 21.—The most
Important aspect, of I he convention of
the American Federation of Lbor, now
in session, is the almost universal con­
viction, not yet. openly expressed, that
the grcatesi struggle in history be­
tween capital and labor is now impend­
ing!
Delegates from all part's of Hie conn
try, ranging in.views and temperament
from staid old conservatives to bellig­
erent young "reds," unite in this belief,
which they base upon considerations
detailed below.
It. is probable that this conviction
will And clear expression when the re­
presentatives of* the railroad brother­
hoods appear before the convention
this week, and that as an outcome de
finite preparations will be made for
mobilizing all the forces of labor in
case the conflict should prove unavoid­
able.
As (he chief basis for their appre­
hensions, the most far-seeing labor
leaders look behind the action of the
railroad executives in lining up to
nullify the Adamson act to the consoli
dation of all the traditional foes of or­
ganized labor in the National Indus­
trial Conference Board, now holding
its first meeting at the Hotel Astor,
New York.
Since the Mulhall scandals, they
point out, the bitterest of these anti­
union organizations—the National As­
sociation of Manufacturers and the Na­
tional Council for Industrial Defense—
have been practically in retirement,
confining their public activities to such
matters as scientific management, ac­
cident prevention, and welfare work,
in the hope that the public would for­
get the disclosures of .Vlulhall and the
lobby investigating committee.
Their emergence into the open, with
a new name and a new set of officers,
is regarded as the sure omen of im­
pending industrial war.
While the names of the officers of
this new organization of foes of union
labor have not hitherto been promi­
nent. trade union officials say. all the
familiar names, associated with the
hardest fought labor battles of the
past, appear among the list of dele­
gates making up the Industrial Con­
ference Board—John Kirby, Jr.. James
A. Emery, Walter Drew. William H.
Barr, Charles Cheney and John P.
Wood.
Consolidation.
Never before has there been so gen­
eral a consolidation of the anti-union
forces of the country as is claimed for
the new organization. Hitherto, em­
ployers in each line or industry have
been content to perfect their own or­
ganization, with only such a loose gen­
eral confederation of interest as was
represented by the National Associa­
tion of Manufacturers, whose activi­
ties were primarily confined to the
field of opposing such labor legislation
as the Clayton act and the child labor
law.
Now, according to unofficial an­
nouncements, all these separate in­
dustrial associations have been weld­
ed together into one organization, in­
cluding the National Founders' asso­
ciation, the National Metal Trades as­
sociation, the National Erectors' asso­
ciation. the National Association of
Cotton Manufacturers, the American
Cotton Manufacturers' association, the
National Association of Wool Manufac­
turers, the Silk Association of Amer­
ica, the United Typothetae, the Ameri­
can Pulp and Paper association, and
the Rubber Club of America.
It is claimed by the promoters of
this consolidation of employers that
the establishment® represented in its
membership have eight billion dollars
capital and employ six million people.
This is discounted by the labor repre
sentatves.

parents sending their children to this

"FAIR SCRAP" AND THE
"BEST MAN" WON
Prussians Often Blow Themselves
Up in Order to Destroy Their
Captors
By WILLIAM PHILIP SIMMS.
(Copyright, 1916, by the United Press)
With the Canadian forces on the
Somme, Nov. 20.—This is the story ol'
the storming of Regina trench, as told
by a sergeant in a Canadian infantry
regiment who was one of the stor
mers. With a slight scalp wound from
a sniper's bullet, which had torn a
huge hole in the steel hlmet which he
was still wearing and another wound
in his shoulder from a shrapnel bul­
let, he was "evacuating" himself to a
dressing station, when I encountered
him. It was on the morning after the
Canadians had ousted the Germans
form their stretch of trench.
Light of Wounds.
Mud from the toes of his hip boots
to his very eyes and with a streak of
blood on one side of his face, the ser­
geant nevertheless made light of his
wounds. He smiled as he responded
to questions.
'Twas a good fair scrap and the
best man won," he explained, speaking
with a typical Irish-American accent
interlarded with American slang. 'We
got the tip at 10 o'clock Friday night
that something would be dono about
midnight. Everybody was tickled be­
cause we'd been hankering to get al
that Regina trench for the past two
weeks.
"Our artillery hit it up better and
better and we could see by the bril­
liant moonlight that it was doing big
damage to Fritz in the trenches a few
hundred yards in front of us. At mid­
night, our artillery formed a barrage
50 yards in front of us—and our first
wave went over the parapet, of our
trenches like a machine.
Hold Them Back.
"Not a son hobbled. My hardest job
was keeping my men from advancing
too fast and getting under our own
shell fire. Also it was pretty hard to
the waves of men straight on account
of the craters and shell holes of var­
ious depths of mud.
"But when we got within 50 yards
of Regina trench we formed a pretty
straight line. About this time the Ger­
mans started their barrage fire too, but
they did little damage, the .fire mostly
going over our heads. As soon as our
barrage lifted off Regina yards and
settled 60 yards back, we stormed
through.
Like Rabbits.
"The Boehes scrapped pretty well
It seemed strange that anybody could
have been left alive after all the shell
ing they'd, had, but they ran out of
dug outs like rabbits and we had to
use our bayonets.
"We cleaned out our trenches in a
very few seconds, taking prisoners
Three in one section were inclined to
be troublesome. We told 'em they'd
better attend to their knitting and be
quiet or else we'd be obliged to finish
'em. Two behaved. But oi\e kept
jumping about, feeling in the shadows
thrown by the full moon, evidently
looking for something. We repeated
our order to stop. He didn't obey.
Well, only two of the three prisoners
taken in that corner of the trench re­
mained. for we remembered a fort­
night ago, a German officer, who after
surrendering, suddenly threw a hand
grenade at one of our officers, blowing
the face off and inflicting wounds from
which he died. The Prussians fre­
quently blew themselves up with their
captors. Other prisoners were both
guards and Saxons.
Respect Red Cross.
"There were several counter at­
tacks after we'd"gotten in the tfench—
mostly down the trench, which was
perpendicular, but we bombed them

Extension
Seattle, Wash., Nov. 21.—H. E'. Far
ling,, vice president of the Milwaukee
line, on his return here yesterday
from the east, officially announced the
completion of plans for building a
feeder extension in North Dakota
next year from New England to Ami
don, to cost $750,000.
This extension will put the Milwau­
kee into a rich new grain tonnage
territory already developed.
Farling spent several days in tour­
ing the farming sections of North
Dakota and Montana. He says farm­
ers in these districts, due to the high
prices of wheat, are enjoying the
greatest prosperity of their history.
High wheat prices the past two years
have resulted in the fall plowing of
a greater acreage than since the be­
ginning of the war.
Aic.kinson bids fair to become a
big railroad center of western North
Dakota, as a result of the initiative
of the farmers and business men in
promoting three independent projects,
preliminary surveys for which have
already been completed, or are now
under way.
The three lines are:
Dickinson to Now Fngland to Mott.
Dickinson to liiernvan.
Dickinson to a point 40 miles north­
west.
The Equity Engineering company
of Fargo is the contracting company
for the handling of each of the three
surveys.
Dickinson is in the heart of a big
district that, is not adequately sup­
plied by railroads, and the business
men there determined to take the in­
itiative in pulling the city on the
map.
Since the people have shown so
much interest in the proposition, it
has been reported that the Northern
Pacific had become interested in a
plan for an extension south from.
Dickinson. Another plan credits the
N. P. with ibeing interested in an
extension of the Mandan-Mott line
to Marmarth, newly selected county
seat of Slope county.
Still another southwestern railroad
project is the proposed extension of
the Milwaukee line from New Kng
land to Amidon.
In northwestern North Dakota, the
Wildrose line will be opened for oper­
ation this week.
The Wildrose extension runs from
Wildrose to Grenora, and rails have
been laid the entire distance.
All along the extension, there has
been intense activity in building pro­
jects, with the result that the line
opens up with real business prospects
right off the jump.
Big celebrations are planned in the
several towns.

Willi only fourteen counties missing,

are located did fairly well.

The vote so far as it i3 tabulated
with fourteen counties missing is 38,
108 for the establishment of the nor­
mal as against 30,044 opposed. Sever­
al of the counties to be heard from offi­
cially will favor the project, so there
seems to be no question of the matter
receiving a -.ajority vote. It ntiw de­
pends upon the majority demanded
under the law. Competent attorneys
insist that all that is necessary is a
majority of those voting on the pro
position and others contend that it
takes a majority of those voting at the
election.
Win Victory.
Prohibition forces have been suc­
cessful in saving the bootlegger law
from repeal. There were 27,636 votes
cast for repeal and 33,794 votes to up­
hold the act. Returns are missing
still from fourteen counties but this
will not change the result.
The farmers have voted to sustain
the repeal of the mill levy for terminal
elevators. They were evidently con­
fused, believing that an affirmative
vote would knock the repeal act out.'
There were 33,143 votes for the repeal
as against 31,640.
Sentiment is closely divided on the
proposition of another insane asylum.
With fourteen counties missing the
vote stands: For the asylum 30,673
and aganst 30.714. The complete re­
turns can easily overcome the lead of
the opposition vote.
Within the next few days the com­
plete vote will be in on the amend­
ments.
