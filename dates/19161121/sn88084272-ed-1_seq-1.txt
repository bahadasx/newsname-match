The American commissioners to
day gave to the Mexican com
missioners what is understood to be the
last opportunity for an amicable set
tlement of the problems that have
arisen because of Gen. Carranza's fail
ure to provide adequate protection for
life and property along the interna
tional border.
In Joint session, secretary of the in
t nor Lane, as chairman of the Ameri
can commission, informed Mr. L-ar-raiua's
representatives that the Ameri
can punitive expedition would be with
drawn within a reasonable time and
under conditions that would not im

; Orders for Clearing Ground
by January 21 Received
in El Paso
Orders for the clearing of the ground
at Mills and Stanton streets, prepara
tory to the construction of the new
postoffice, were received from Wash
ington by postmaster E. A. Shelton. cus
todian of the new postoffice, Monday.
The orders call for the clearing of the
ground by January 21, and it is as
sumed that active work of excavation
and construction will be begun shortly
after that date.
Orders for the clearing of the ground
were received from H. G. Sherwood,
acting executive officer of the treasury
department, and supervisor of the gov
ernment architects' office. The orders
called for the notification of the ven
dors; or present lessees, of the site
to have all buildings removed and the
site absolutely cleared within 69 days
from the day the notification was re
ceived. The lessees held the land sub
ject to such an order from the gov
ernment. The site of the new postoffice meas
ures 120 by 200 feet. It includes the
old Pacific hotel, known many years
ago as the old Seely house. This is
a two story structure, with a restau
rant, floral shop, and real estate office
in the ground floor.
This is welcome news," said post
master Shelton upon receipt of the or
ders from Washincton. 'l suppose the
work of construction will go right
ahead, following the clearing of the
site. We are badlv in need of more
room for the handling of mail in El
Paso."

But May Be Trapped.
London, Eng.. Nov. 21. By bold and ;
rapid strokes the Teutonic invaders
apparently have conquered a large sec
tion of northwestern WallachU from
the Rumanians. The Petrograd offi
cial bulletin today announces a Ru
manian retirement in this part of the
battle front to the region of Fllliash.
40 miles northwest of Craivoa. Judging
from the recent reports of the opera
tions, this means that converging at
tacks by Anstro-Gennan forces moving
southward in the Jlul valley have com
pelled the Rumanians to withdraw and
execute a rapid retreat in the Jlul val
ley. THls move was made, it appears,
to prevent the retreat oi their armies
from being cut off.
Whether even the rapid retreat in
dicated has been in time to save the
Rumanian armies in this region is
rendered doubtfulby the German an
nouncement that Teutonic troops are
now before Craiova.

Can't Do Without Herald
Editor EI Paso Herald:
There is no way getting around it, I must have a Herald to get
all the information about Mexico and the southwest. You certainly
have SOME paper.
I don't suppose you know that you have a good EI Paso booster
hi the ranks of the 33d Michigan.' Maj". A. H. Gannser, of the 33d
Michigan, is the writer of the enclosed clippings. This man was elected
to the state legislature without making a speech, or spending a dime,
and while on duty on the Mexican border for president Wilson, and
he is a Republican at that.
I am enclosing a check herewith in payment of subscription to
March 22. 1917. Kindly change my address to read 1018 Broad
