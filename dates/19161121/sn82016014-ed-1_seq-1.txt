Trainmen Leaders Address
American Federation Labor.
Baltimore. Nov. 21. Affiliation of
the members of the American Federa
tion of Labor and the four big railroad
brotherhoods for effecting the general
betterment of labor was urged today
before the federation convention here
by the brotherhood heads and Presi
dent Samuel A. Gompers. Delegates
who crowded the hall cheered all the
speakers enthusiastically. "We must
hang together or we will hang sepa
rately." W. G. Lee, spokesman for the
brothehoods and head of the railway
trainmen, declared.
"It is a great comfort to know,
President Gompers said, "that the time
is not far distant when the great
brotherhoods will be a part of the
American Federation of Labor."
Lee explained that the laws of the
brotherhoods now prevent an official
affiliation with the federation until
after their convention is held, but he
insisted that between now and that
time the organization? could co-operate
with the same purpose as if they
were officially affiliated. He also
made it plain that the brotherhoods
were not bringing their eight-hour day
troubles to the federation for support.
Will I'ight for Eight-Hour I .aw.
"I am about anarchist enough, how
ever," he said, "to say that we are
going to work for the eight-hour day
for all classes. If we can't get it
peaceably, we will fight for it."
Lee said that some sort of affilia
tion should be effected to fight any
proposed arbitration legislation which
might be unfair to labor. President
Wilson plans such legislation, he said,
und it should be carefully watched. He
declared that the congress had no
right to pass any law compelling a
man to work, provided he was not in
yrtson. if he did not want to, and he
did not think It would do so.
Prolonged cheering followed praise
of President Wilson by Mr. Lee.
"It took more courage for him to
write across the front pages of the
newspapers of this country that he was
for an S-hour working day than it
would have taken for him to have
written that this country was at war
with Mexico." he said.
our principal object now is to help
the president and the men in both
branches of congress to make good
their promises to us. I believe they
will do it."
Mr. Lee declarer! failure of the
brotherhoods and the federation to af
filiation hefore now has not been
wholly the fault of either side.
Near Affiliation Today.
"We are nearer affiliation today
than we ever have been before," he
said.
"We shall go the limit to obtain bet
ter conditions, particularly for the
men on the railroads that the com
pany will not permit to organize, we
will not strike nor go out to help
them, but we will use our best efforts
to obtain better conditions for them."
Mr. Lee paid his respects to the
"Wall street crowd," and declared
that now an election had been without
the assistance of New York. Indiana
or Illinois, labor should not fail to re
tain its power thus gained. Mr. Lee
also reviewed the conferences which
led to the enactment of the Adamson
8-hour law last September and charg
ed the railroad heads with playing un
fairly with the president at that time.
The brotherhoods, he declared, had no
desire that the Adamson bill be enact
i, k, . ' 'L - 7. 1.1
beenme a law. they were trying to live
up to it.
Immediately after the close of Gom
pers speech the brotherhood heads left
the hall.

St. Joseph, Mo., Nov. 21. Police of
ficers continued to testify in the crim
inal court here today in the state's
case against Prosecutor Oscar D. Mc
Daniel who is on trial on the charge
of having murdered his wife, Mrs.
Harriet Moss McDaniel. Little testi
mony not previously adduced, was pre
sented during the morning session
and defense attorneys expressed them
selves as being jubilant over the lack
of evidence so far produced against
the accused man.
Testimony given by John Frank,
motorcycle policeman, attacking Mc
Daniel's version of the crime, was
largely broken down by the cross
examination of Judge C. F. Strop,
chief defense counsel. Continuing his
questioning, Judge Strop brought out
other testimony considered favorable
for the defense.
"Did not you say Oscar McDaniel
deplored the fact that his wife's as
sailant had not taken his (McDaniel's)
life?" Judge Strop asked.
"Yes, sir."
"Did not you testify at the coroner's
inquiry McDaniel practically col
lapsed ?" .
Lawyer Was Grief-Stricken.
"Yes, sir, he was grief -stricken."
Frank declared.
The large crowds that previously
have attended sessions of the trial
were missing today. When court con
vened many seats were vacant. They
filled only slowly.
James A. Clouser, former chief of
police and who was the last witness
yesterday, continued his testimony to
day. He was cross-examined by
Judge C. F. Strop, chief defense coun
sel. "Did the thought ever enter your
mind that McDaniel was trying to get
rid of evidence?" he was asked.
"No," the former chief answered.

DEUTSGHLAND OFF
German Under-Sea Freighter
Leaves for Bremen.
Departure Follows Disastrous
Attempt Last Week.
New London, Conn., Nov. 21. The
German undersea freighter Deutsch
land made her second start for her
home port of Bremen at 2:35 . this
afternoon, escorted by two tugs which
'were to accompany her to the three
miie limit at the end of the sound.
To the accompaniment of cheers
from the crew of her "mo'her ship"
Willehad, the Deutschland slowly
swung out into the harbcr shortly
after 2:30. The great steel net, which
guarded her stern had been swung
aside and the sea-green monster of the
deep slipped out of her berth under
her own power.
Tujcs Convoy to Sea.
At 2:15 the tugs F. A. Beckwith and
Alert reported at the submersible's
pier to escort her out to the three mils
Imit.
It was reported along me water
ifront at that time that the Deutsch-
land would sail within a half hour.
Captain Koenig and all members of
the submarine's crew were aboard
when the two tugs came churning up
to the dock where the Deutschland
was tied up alongside the liner Wille
had. It was understood that all repairs
made necessary by the collision with
the tug T. A. Scott Jr., in which five
men perished, had been made and
with the last libel lifted, there was
nothing to prevent the giant submers
ible again starting on her homeward
dash.
No Secrecy About Departure.
There was no secrecy Incident to the
Deutschland's departure.
Early in the day rumors were flying
that the submersible might sail at any
time. At 2:10 two tugs reported at
the pier ready to escort her to sea
and crowds were then soon lining the
shore.
At 2:40 the Deutschland passed Fort
Trumbull and was headed for the
sound.
The submersible will pass the Race
rocks, where she collided with the tug
T. A. Scott, jr., last Monday, about
4:30 this afternoon, judging from the
speed she was making as she cleared
the harbor. Five men perished when
the tug sank in this accident, and it is
assumed Captain Koenig decided not
to attempt to pass thru these danger
ous waters again at night.
The submersible will be able to clear
the race well before dark.
BANKERS AT JUNCTION

Junction City, Kan., Xov. 21. C. W.

Brotherhood Chiefs Retract

SANTA FE CASE UP FIRST
Await Decision of Kansas City
Court as Criterion.
Question of Wrages Minimized
Now to Come Up Later.
Washington, Nov. 21. A general
railroad strike January 1 may not fol
low as the result of the present situa
tion, growing out of the Adamson law
dispute.
This interpretation was placed to
day on remarks of Chief Stone of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
that the question of such a strike
"will be answered later." The ele
ment of doubt regarding his remarks
arises from the fact that last week
in New York, brotherhood chiefs flat-
footedly said there would be a strike
if they did not get a real eight-hour
day.
Before A. F. of Ii. In Baltimore.
Now it is believed the br herhoods
will be content to await a test of con
stitutionality of the Adamson eight
hour measure. The brotherhood's,
however, are shrouding their move
ments in an even deeper secrecy than
that which marked their program
when they threatened strike last sum
mer. Today the brotherhood chiefs are in
Baltimore to speak before the Ameri
can Federation of Labor convention -a
move that portends co-operation be
tween them and the railway depart
ment of the federation to force an
eight-hour day in all branches of rail
road service.
At the same time the department
of justice and the brotherhoods legal
department are ready for the opening
of the Adamson tests Thursday when
the' Union Pacific and Santa Fe start'
their suits at Kansas City. The course
taken by the court in these cases will
be vital and upon itu action will prob
ably rest the final decision on the
brotherhoods as to whether there
shall be a strike.
Would Eliminate State Control.
The Newlands committee investiga
tion of the general subjects of rela
tions between railroads and the public
will continue with the railroads put
ting forth proposals for alleviation of
what they regard as an irksome con
dition. They will fight particularly
for elimination of control by state
railroad commissions.
The question of wages has been
minimized to date but when brother
hood leaders return they probably
will ask a hearing and precipitate
sharp discussion on that point.
THE LAST WORD
Women Always Have It, So
Here Is Final Version.
Snffragist Says Hughes Didn't
Back Up His Promise.
Albany, Nov. 21. In her annual ad
dress delivered today to the forty
eighth annual convention of the New
York State Woman Suffrage party,
Mrs. Norman de R. Whitehouse, the
chairman, urged all suffragists to
work like professionals and not like
amateurs for the adoption of the suf
frage amendment in 1917.
Referring to the recent presidential
campaign Mrs. Whitehouse said:
"The wise and experienced political
leaders of both parties played for the
support of the women voters. Afr.
Hughes' statement on suffrage in his
speech of acceptance and his declara
tion on the following day promised
real support for our cause, which his
subsequent silence did not bear out.
Cites Montana as Illustration.
"Both political parties blamed the
women for not succeeding where they,
themselves, had failed. There could
never have been so plain an evidence
of the folly and absurdity of women
working for parties which as yet deny
them political freedom."
Mrs. Whitehouse cited the election
to congress of Miss Jeanette Rankin
of Montana, as an example that wom
en will "stand together."
"When she was nominated,' Mrs.
Whitehouse said, "Montana was a
Democratic state. Montana remained
a Democratic state and gave President
Wilson a majority of 27,000 but it
elected the Republican Jeanette Ran
kin. She was the only Republican in
the state who was elected. Women
must have stood together for her."

FORTUNEAT STAKE
Resume Legal Battle Over In
heritance of Half Million.
Renew Claim That He Was
Adopted From Orphanage.
Kansas City. Nov. 21. Further re
hearsal of testimony covering the last
six years was expected today at the
resumption in federal court in Kansas
City, Kan., of the pult brought' by
Benjamin Dorrance, representing the
legal heirs, contesting the decision of
a special commissioner in St. Louis
last April, in awarding the estate of
Charles Dorrance, a wealthy resident
of Chariton county, Missouri, to
Charles Francis Dorrance. The es
state is valued at nearly half a million
dollars.
Attorneys for Benjamin Dorrance
dispute the parentage of Charles Fran
cis Dorrance, who is claimed to be a
son of John Dorrance, to whom the
estate was left by Charles Doprance,
the head of the family, on his death.
The plaintiffs alleged the present
holder of the estate was adopted from
an orphanage institution in St. Louis
by John Dorrance and his wife.
Testimony of a Catholic sister, in
charge of the hospital at St. Louis
where Mrs. Dorrance claims the pres
ent holder of the estate was born, was
expected today. This testimony was
ruled out by the special commissioner
when the case was heard before him.
OPEN FIGHT HERE
Kansas To Be First Battle
ground of Adamson Law.
C. B. & Q. and Kansas City Ter
minal File Suit Today.
Kansas will be the first battle
ground of the nation-wide industrial
war, resulting from the enactment of
the Adamson law. Mort Albaugh,
clerk of the United States district
court in Topeka, announced today
that first application for injunctions
against the Adamson law brought by
railroads thruout the United States
would be heard in the United States
district court at Kansas City, Kan.,
Thursday morning. Two more appli
cations were filed in his office today
by the C. B. & Q. railroad and the
Kansas City Terminal, making a total
of five applications filed in a week.
Fred Robertson, United States dis
trict attorney, stated over the long
distance telephone today that applica
tions of the Santa Fe, Union Pacific,
C. B. & Q. and Kansas City & South
ern would be heard Thursday morn
ing. He understands that the gov
ernment will rush two attorneys to
Kansas City from Washington, who
will aid in the fight of capital vs. la
bor. These men are G. Carroll Todd
and D. Marvin Underwood.
The applications are for tempo
rary injunctions aeainst the law." said
Mr. Robertson. "Whether the attor
neys win decide to present the case
for final submission, rests with the
railroad attorneys."
In short, the railroads declare the
Adamson act unconstitutional. Wheth
er the hearing of the Kansas City Ter
minal will come up Thursday is not
known. Mr. Robertson had not been
officially informed of the filing of its
application today.

Maximum Amount of Work
After Great War. I
GRIME OF INDUSTRIAL UNREST
Unprecedented Conditions De
mand Efficiency Xow.
Permit Exporters to Organize
Without Trust Fear.
Washington. Nov. 21. A call to
American business to meet unprece
dented trade conditions after the war,
is to be the keynote of President Wil
son's message to congress Tuesday,
December 5. The president is com
pleting the message today and expects
soon to have it in the hands of the
printer.
The president believes the country's
industries can do a maximum amount
of work only when there is a minimum ,
of industrial unrest. His message is
expected to emphasize this in an ap
peal to employer and employe for
more co-operation, more confidence of
each in the other and less tendency to
class feeling.
In thia connection, the president had
formulated plans for rendering prac
tically impossible strikes of all kinds.
He will urge completion of a program
similar to that proposed in his last
message to handle such situations as
the recent threatened strike of the
railroad brotherhoods.
I Believing the railroad problem as
, Important a domestic issue as con
j fronts the country, the president will
j urge congress to give the most careful
j consideration to possible legislation
which will aid the transportation sys
tems to expand and to improve, to
meet the additional stress under which
they will be placed at the close of the
war.
Abroad also the foundations must
be laid for the coming trade upheaval,
the president believes. He will urge
congress to act immediately upon a
measure along the lines of the Webb
bill which would have permitted
American exporters to organize with
out fear of anti-trust law action.
O tler Recommendations,
-In addition to these the -president's
message will urge action upon differ
ent measures recommended " in his
message of a year ago and which are
still on the list of the administration's
"unfinished business." They are ex
pected to include:
Conservation laws, legislation for
rendering fuller political justice to the
people of Porto Rico, a corrupt prac
tices act, federal aid and stimulation
to industrial and vocational education
like that given in the field of agricul
tural industry and possibly laws giv
ing federal agents more effective
weapons to use in dealing with con
spirators aeainst the neutra.litv of the
government,
The president also probablv will
urge continuation of "preparedness for
peace" by continuance of a progres
sive program of national defense in
cluding material additions to the
navy. In his recent pleas for the union
of nations to prevent future wars, the
president has pointed out that if
America is to play her part in enforc-
ing tnis peace, sne must nave tne ne
cessary means.

London, Nov. 21. Another Russiaa
offensive along the line from Con-.;
stanza to Cernovada is now expected
to increase the intensity of the fight- !
ing in the Balkans. Military experts
here today agreed this was the only
step which could be relied upon to les- .'
sen the weight of General von Fal- .
kenhayn's tremendous pressure on the "
Wallachian frontier of Rumania . ,
pressure which it is now admitted
constitutes the gravest menace to Ru-
mania.
The Rumanian army is in ths "
greatest danger of being outflanked, r
if the German official statement spec '
"j-iiiB near approach of the Teutons
to Craiova is accurate. The Ruman
ians are being forced back down the '
valley of the Jiul.
Have Half Million Men.
Meanwhile von Falkenhayn, with a
force estimated at half a million men,
is sweeping around their rear, stea.l
ily lessening the gap thru which thev

line of retreat so that its direction,
apparently, must be due east.
?i-leS? there B a diversion some
where else in the Balkan campaign to
stop von Falkenhayn s thrust, it an"
peared almost certain today that com

of Rumania would be necessary to
