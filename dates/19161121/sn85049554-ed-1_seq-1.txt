examination from Attorney Beeson, of
Jones' counsel,
Crosa Eximination Continued.
At the beginning of Monday after

continued his cross examination of
Mrs. Tompkins.
"What did Wilkerson say to you
about talking about this?" Mr. Beeson
asked, referring to the 'murder plot'
which she, Ja said to have-overheard.
"I told him' about so many coming
to me about it and he said to tell them
anything to get rid of them," Mrs.
Tompkins replied.
"In the talk of getting you paid did
you refer to Wilkerson in that man
ner?" Mr. Beeson asked.

Mr, Mitchell then took his witness
again and asked:
"Did you tell the truth this morning
when I asked you of what*-you saw at
the slaughter house?"
"Yes sir," (Mrs. Tompkins replied.
Continuing his questioning into the
connections of Senator Van Law in
bringing her back to Bed Oak. Mrs.
Tompkins said that Mr, Van Law told
her and her husband not to see any
body, and to Aay in their rooms until
ready-to testify. She said Wilkerson
had never asked her to come tov Red
Oak.
Mrs.' Tompkins further stated that
Mr? Van Law told her that Mr. Jones
had made arrangements to pay all her
expenses and that Van Law had said
"if you don't -come down without a
subpoena we'll subpoena you."
Mrs. (Tompkins also said that Mr.
Van Law had told them nothing abou:

In her morning testimony Mrs.
Tompklna had said that two men from
Vilisca had come to see her at Mar

In the further dlreot examination on
this subject in the afternoon Mrs.
Tompkins said that Hank Horton,

Mr. Lewis, did most of-the talking
"Why didn't you tell these men what
you had seen?" Mr. Mitohell asked.
"I was afraid to and I thought it was
none of their business," thev witness
answered.
Another piece of the "murder plot'
which Mrs. Tompkins did no tell in her
morning examination was brought out
in the afternoon. "They could get by

"Did that have anything to do with
your refusing to talk with those men?"
she was asked.

In continuing his cross examination
tyr. Beeson asked Mrs. Tompkins why
she hadn't told the. statement about
"getting by witfi the marshal". befdre.
She said she ddin't think of it.
"Haven't you been asked again and
again t9 tell all you knew?" questioned
Mr. Beeson again.
"I didn't think of It," she Replied.
"Didn't Wilkerson talk to you and
tell you to say that?"
"No. sir I don't think he talked to
me," she .answered. .There had been a
cOurt receae "Just prior to the time
Mrs. Tompkins had made the state

•By the time you have a further talk
with Wilkerson you'll think up a whole
lot more, won't you?" continued Mr.
•Beeson*.
Didn't Tell All to Van Law.
Mr. Beeson also Inquired very care
fully of Mrs. Tptapklns why she hadn't

examination this morning to Senator
Van Law at Marshalltown. The wit
ness declared that she was not under
oath when talking to Senator Van Law
apd she didn'tf think she had to tell the
/truth until she was under oath. Mrs.
Tompkins also stated that she had told
Senator Van Law that she didn't re
member all she had'told to Wilkerson.
Asked if she did, she said, "I did but I
didn't want to tell' him".

Then Mr. Beeson went on to ask her
of a conference that Mr. Pringle, Mr.

her husband and himself had had in
her room.
"You were asked to make a complete

"Yes sir," Mrs. Tompkins said.
In further direct examination Mr.
Mitchell asked of Mrs. Tompkins: "Waa
there anything said in the willows aboi^t
where the money was to go?"
"Yes," she answered. Being asked
where, she said: "Well, Jake said,
'where will we get the money and
someone answered: "Out north where

Going baclc to the Senator Van Law
incident again Mr. Mitchell asked:
"How many times had you seen

"Once, early in the spring," she said.
Mrs. Tompkins said that when

Four Big Railroad Brother
hoods to Affiliate With
Federation.
GOMP£RS AND LEE
WARN MONEY'CLASS
Declaration Made That Movement For
Eight-Hour Day For All Classes of
Labor Will Be Launched—President
Wilaon Praiaed and Cheered and Hie
Compuleory Program Condemned
and'Threatened at Same Time,
Baltimore, Nov. 21.—Affiliation^ of
the members of the American Federa
tion of Labor and the four big railroad
brotherhoods for effecting the better
ment of labor was urged today before
the federation convention here by the
brotherhood heads and President
Samuel A.- Gompers. Delegates who
crowded the halls cheered all of the
speakers enthusiastically.
"We must hang together or we will
hang separately," W. G. Lee, spokes
man for the brotherhoods and head of
the railway trainmen, declared.
•It is a great comfort to know,"
President Gompers said, "that the time
is not far distant when the great
brotherhoods wiir be a part of the
American Federation of Labor."
Lee Threatens to Fight.
Mr. Kee explained that the laws of
the brotherhoods now prevent an offi
cial affiliation with the federation un
til after their convention is held, but
he insisted that between now and that
time the organizations could co
operate with .the same purpose as if
they were officially affiliated. He
said the brotherhoods were not bring
ing their "eight-hour day" difficulties
to the federation for support.
"I am about anarchist enough, how
ever," he said, "to say that we are
going to work for the eight-hour day
for all classes. If we can't get it
peacefully, we will fight for it."
Lee said some sort of affiliation
should be effected to fight any pro
posed arbitration legislation which
might be unfair to labor. President
Wilson plans some such legislation, he
d: flared.. He declared, confess has
rlAt to'frass a law cohipetllrfg a
man -to work, providing he were not
in prison, if he did not want to, and, he
did not think it would do so.
Wilaon Praise Bringa Cheers.
Prolonged cheering followed praise
of President Wilson by Lee.
"It took more courage for! him to
write across the front pages of the
newspapers of this country that he
w«^s for an eight-hour work day than
it' would have taken for him to have
Written that this country was at war
with Mexico," he said. "Our object
now is to help the president and the
men in both branches in congress to
irake good their promises to us I be
lieve they will do it.
"It is absolutely necessary for us
who are organized to get together and
I say that we shall go the limit to
obtain better conditions, particularly
for the men on the railroads that the
company will not permit to organize.
We will not strike or go out to help
them, but we will use our efforts to
obtain better conditions for them."
Gompers Is Defiant.
President Gompers said:
"We expect that the railroad broth-'
erhoods on Jan. 1 next will inauguram
the eight-hour work day, and I con say
you have the undivided support of the
organized worklngmen and women
represented by the American Federa
tion of Labor. When the money power
of the United States failed in the at
tempt to corrupt the electorate and
when their plans were upset by the
vote of the citizenship of the United
States, the capitalists showed their col
ors. They met and gave 6ut a decla
ration that they were going to antag
onize every effort»put forth by or
ganized labor. But. men of wealth, I
say to you, be careful how far you go.
There Is a limit even to human endur
ance. You Uhrow down* the gauntlet.
We accept the challenge. When the
time comes It will be another case of
'Lay on, Macduff, and damned be he
who first cries 'hold,, enough.
W. S. Carter, president of the Broth
erhood of Railway Firemen and En
ginemen, declared that the danger that
confronts all working people today is
the ''coercion or subordination of the
fublic press by the master class."
"The coming of the penny paper," he
added, "has done more than anything
else to place the press under the domi
nation of advertisers. Unfortunately,
labor has little to do with advertising,
practically all the advertisements com
ing from the ma*«ter class."
To Ignore Injunctions.
The organised labor forces of the
country yesterday avowed hostility to
the writ of injunction as a means of
stopping a strike.
First, a resolution was adopted
unanimously at the morning session of
the convention of the American Fed
eration of llabor urging organised
labor everywhere to make the Injunc
tion question "the paramount issue in
.all of their future political activities."
A more radical step was taken at
the afternoon session, when the com
mittee. on the executive council's re
port took up that feature of the re'
port dealing with the decision of the
Massachusetts supreme ^urt classi
fying labor a$ property. The com
mittee submitted and the convention
unanimously adopted a recommenda
tion "that any injunction dealing with
the relationship of employer and enw
pioye and based on the dictum that
labor Is property, be disregarded, let
the coosequenoea be what they may,"
Must Ditobey Judge*.
The commlttee'a report follows:..
"It seems to, be a settled purpose of
interests antagonistic to the freedom
of men and women who labor to per
suade and then use the Judiciary and

As .to Border Protection.
The question at issue is not the with

The Mexicans will not be permitted to
place restrictions on the manner in
which the American government may
protect its border, nor on the manner
in which it may punish marauding ban
dits.
It was reported here as not improb
able that a delay might be caused by
the desire of the Mexicans to communi

taken for the Mexicans to report the
new situation to their chief and for him
to reply, it Is possible nothing may be
done until Saturday.
