bassy, today received the German re
ply in regard to the sinking of the
British 'steamer Rowanmore and
three steamers"which were lost in Sep
tember. In - regard r to the Rowan
more the -German government denies
that the submarine, fired on lifeboats
containing members of the crew and
maintains that the men on the Row
anmore owe their lives to the-precautions
taken by the Germans and the
skill Vlth which their operations
were carried out.
In respect to two of the remaining
steamers in question, the . German
government states they were not' sunk
by German forces and maintains that
the Antwerpen, the third steamer,
was destroyed in full accordance with
the' rules of international law.
The Antwerpen was built at New

CHARGE OF SHORT
WEIGHT AGAINST
COAL MERCHANT
Prominent Stratford Busir
ness Man Under Arrest
State Police Act.
EDSON W. HALL SAYS
i it's All a mistake
Left Weighing to Foreman,
, and Latter Left It to His
Daughter.
"Who weighed the' coal?"
That is" the question, going ' the
rounds in Stratford today," that prom
ises to become as permanent, in ' the
old town's history, as the immortal
query, "Who struck Billy Patterson ?"
The coal in question was a load
or was it a ton? sold by Edson W.
Hall, one of the town's best known
merchants, who has conducted, for
many years, a coal yard at 555 Broad
St. Mr. Hall lives at 1536 Main street.
Hall is under arrest, charaged with
selling at short weight. Owing to
his prominenence in town, and his
extensive property interests the au
thorities did not deem it necessary
to exact a bond for his appearance,
when the case is called in the Strat
ford Town Court tomorrow morning
at 9 o'clock.- ' .
Hall jwas taken into , custody . this
forenoon. State Policemen Virelll
and Stiles gathered the evidence last
Friday on which the warrant for his
arrest was issued. peputy Sheriff E.
Mills Tomlinson served the warrant
on Hall at his office today.
Virelli and Stiles spent several hours
,on Friday watching the coal teams
leaving the yard ' of Hall. At length
they halted a team driven by Lewis
Munn, an employe of Hall. ' "The team
was destined, for the home in Church
street of Jam.es P., McNamara, man
ager Of the Stratford . bowling alleys.
The ? state policemen turned the
team about, had it driven back to
Hall's scales, and weighed. There is
a question as to what the weight, as
recorded under the supervision of the
state officers, showed. v .
Hall today, in discussing the case
with a reporter for The Farmer, said
that it was 215 pounds 6hprt of a
ton., He explained this on the
ground that no one had weighed 1 the
coal. It was simply an 'error. " , '
Hall had left, it to his foreman,
Henry Blake, 18 years in. his em
ploy. Blake, according to Hall, left
it to Miss Florence Blake, his daugh
ter, who is a , clerk in the Hall coal
office. , - Miss Blake thought - her
father had . supervised the , weighing
of the coal, according to Hall, and in
tire division of responsibility, no one
weighed - the coal, v
Hall said it was true' the state po
lice had been about his yard several
hours on Friday last. He expressed
regret at the situation which he said
placed him in a false light, and' de
clared that his record for business
integrity in the town "ought to be suf
ficient to ' convince every one of his
good intentions. .
The state police, in their oomplalnt
to ' Prosecuting Attorney Ivan I.
Morehouse, allege that, the "ton" s was
306 pounds short. , I y ;

-' - j
Atlantic Cfty, Nov. 21 The Ameri
can mediators today gave the Mexi
can comissioners what is understood
to be the last opportunity for an amic
able settlement of the questions that
have arisen because of Carranza's re
ported failure to provide adequate
protection for life and property along
the International border. -
In ; joint session, Secretary of the
Interior Lane, as chairman of the
American commission informed Mr.
Carranza's representatives that that
American punitive expedition would
be withdrawn . within a reasonable
time and under conditions that would
not impair the dignity of the Ameri
can government or leave unprotected
the territory just south of the border
now patrolled by the Americans.
Incident to such withdrawal he out
lined the manner in which the Ameri
can government was prepared to
guard the long line, of frontier and U
run down and punish any marauding
band that attempted a crossing into
the United States. He made it olear
to the Mexicans that this government
would not' tolerate any restrictions on
the pursuit of bandits .by .American
troops.
How Luiz Cabrera, chairman of the
Mexican commission, and his col
leagues received what is regarded as.
the last word, bf the American com
missioners was not , expected to be
known until after the session came to
an end this afternoon.
When Mr. Lane went into the con
ference room this -morning he carried
in with him the assurance of the Pres
ident that he had unqualified backing
of his ,pian. The Mexicans were
aware of the President's attitude and
it was. regarded as probable that thej
would recede trqm the position they
had taken.

ELM COUNTRY

PKANHOM1
Negro Asylum in Milford
May Be Removed to Ex-
elusive Greens Farms.
With the possibility of the Elm
Country club, formerly the George
Jennings estate in Southport, soon be
coming a large negro orphan asylum,
with one large dormitory and several
colony buildings distributed over the
30 beautiful acres . of land in the ex
clusive Southport "residential section
now occupied by numbers of, wealthy
New Yorkers' homes, the neighbor
hood, is aroused against the action of
the owner. ) .
From inquiry made today if appears
that George S. Jennings, the present
owner was unaware of the project for
which the options recently, signed by
him were given. Negotiations were
carried on. he says, by reputable
realty men of the vicinity and he had
no knowledge that a colored institu
tion was to be reared in the midst of
the summer colony.
Though Rev. George Tillman,' owner
of the Rescue Home for Old Ladies,
recently established opposite River
cliff park at the eastern approach to
Washington bridge Tin Milford could
not be reached on the' telephone today
for confirmation of the statement,
realty operators in this city declare
that' the new options are held ror nis
purchase. There are two options, one
expiring in three months, and a sec
ond option expiring at a later date
upon the payment o a stipulated sum
mentioned in the first as a forfeit. ,
Real estate dealers declare that
with the building: of a new bridge
across the Housatonic to replace the
present light structure, the" Rescue
home property in Milford would have
to be condemned. It is a safeguard
against this" procedure that the pres
ent long term options are said to
have been solicited. ,
Rev. Mr. Tillman came from Bos
ton to this section of Connecticut sev
eral years ago. He located a home
for the aged at Milford and has since
carried on an elaborate system of col
lections in New Haven, Bridgeport,
Milford . and Stratford: Inquiry , by
eharitable . institutions has failed to
divulge . much information about the
various purposes for which the in
stitution is conducted. It is said cer
tain religious rites are held by the
inmates and baptisms in the river
have attracted wide publicity. That
the collections in Bridgeport and New
Haven have been somewhat curtailed
bv the nolice of the two cities is as
serted by the Charity Organization
society of Bridgeport, which through
having sent several , investigators to
the home has been unable to collect
much information about the actual
conduct of the place. As far as can
be learned both white and negro
women have been welcomed and kept
at the home.

Brooklyn girl, cousin of the
Rev. Orestes P. Chornock, pas-
tor ' of the Ruthenian Greek
Catholic church, . was x found
cold in death, suspended, by a
clothesline from the, rafters in
the attic of the church rectory, ;
717 Arctic street, Jhis morning
at 8:30 o'clock by ' the priest's
wife. ' . , ,
Her heart broken by the
knowledge that her fast failing
vision would ultimately con
sign her to a life of total dark
ness, crazed by the horror of .
spending her future days in
blindness, her ambitions, girl
hood dreams and plans for, the
future forever deA, life failed
to hold for her further joy she
had hanged herself. ,
Pinned to Iier breast was the f ol-'
lowing note, explaining her rash deed,
culminating the letter with four lines
from the immortal farewell of Moore,
"The Journey Onward": .
"This deed,, I have done myself. I
have lost my vision. Life for me has "
lost, its joy. v I am of no earthly use,
doomed soon to become 'a burden.
"So "both we part from all we love,
.Fronj all the lines that bind tfs;
So turn our hearts, as on we rove, "
To those we've left behind us.,
"IRENE."
Before coming to visit her cousin.
Father Chornock, the girl consulted
an eye specialist in New York, who
had told her the condition of her sight
was such that he could find no remedy
for its restoration and that she event-
ually would be blind. ' . ,
Three weeks ago she left her aunt
and sister in Brooklyn, packed xher
bag, stating that she intended to pay
a visit to her cousin in this city. She
left home lamenting her misfortune
and expressing a desire for death." She '
since has lived with- the priest, and ,
had been given a room on the second
floor of the house.
Early last night she went to a .
nearby dentist to have a tooth filled. ,
On her return she ate supper, left the'
church rectory and entering the dimJy
lighted edifice, walked to the' altar
rail, spending some time m prayer. :
At 9 o'clock she bade goodnight to
the priest and his wife and signified , '
her intention; of retiring. As near as
the authorities can learn the girl went f
directly to the attic of the house, hav
ing secreted a clothesline in the room.
Drawing a trunk from a corner of
the attic she wrote her farewell note, ,
pinned to her breast and then turned
the trunk end upwards, and cli:nbed '
on top of it Grasping an end of the
clothesline she fastened It around her
neck, after forming a noose of the
end. '
She then threw the line over the
rafter, repeated the operation, doubl
ing the ' strength of the rope once ,
more winding it about her neck and
making the end secure. Shehen thrust
the trunk from under her. ' ,5
'. Her body was thrown with such im
petus that her neck was broken and
death occurred, according to Dr. J. P.
Canavan, almost instantly. '
This morning at about 8:30 Mrs.
Chornock went to the girFs room to
summon her to breakfast. " The bed
