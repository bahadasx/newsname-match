PRESIDENT WILSON GIVES ASSURANCES HE
WILL BACK OUR COMMISSION'S DEMAND
Cabrera Purports to Be Hopeful of an Amicable Agreement,
But It Is Believed He Has Won Over Colleagues to His
Position of Refusing Any Settlement Which Does Not
Include Right of Mexico to Govern Movement of the
American Forces.
(By Review Leased Wire
ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 20. Luis
Cabrera and his colleagues on the
Mexican-American joint commission,
will be formally told tomorrow by,
Secretary of the Interior Lane, chair-
man of the American commission, on j
just what terms an agreement provid-;
in for the withdrawal or the Ameri- j
can punitive expedition and the pro
tection of life and property along the ;
International border may be reacnea.
Fortified by the assurances of Pres
ident Wilson that he will back the
American representatives in their ef
forts to reach a settlement of the
questions at issue between Mexico
an 3 the United States. Secretary Lane
returned late today. He immediately
went Into conference with Dr. J. El
Mott and Judge Georee Gray, the oth
er American commissioners, inform
ing them in detail of the conference :
he had at Washington Saturday with
the President. The formal meeting
with the Mexicans will take place to
morrow. Cabrera Hopeful
The Mexicans appeared not to take
a pessimistic view of the situation,
Mr. Cabrera again assuring newspap
er 5nen that he was very hopeful of
an amicable agreement There ' was
no evidence, however, that he'was pre
pared to recede from his position so
long maintained, that agreement to
the American plans was iout cf the
question. There was some reason to
night, to believe that Mr. Cabrera had
won his colleagues over to an agree
ment to stand with him.
The plan to be placed before the
Mexicans will contain nothing that is
new to the issue. ' The question of is
sue Is not the withdrawal of General
Pershing's troops. They will be call
ed back when the American govern
ment is convinced that it can be done
fwithout jeopardizing the safety of the
.border. The more debatable question
is the method of controlling the bor
der after they have been taken out.
The Mexicans will not be permitted
to place restrictions on the manner
in which the American government
may protect its border nor on the
manner in which It may punish ma
rauding bandits.
Troops Restricted
The Mexicans have objected seri
ously to acknowledging the right of
the United States to send troops
across the International border in pur
suit of bandits, but have been more
Insistent that in case the troops are
sent that they be moved only with re
strictions. When the Mexican com
missioners leave here It will be with

Massing for Attack

DOUGLAS, Nov. 20. Approximately
fifteen hundred troops are now quar
tered in Agua Prieta, opposite Doug

rorce being gathered by General P.
Elias Calles to engage in the campaign
against Villa. Other troops are re
ported to be moving northward, while
confidential advices received here to
day Indicate that Sonora's entire mili
tary strength with the exception of
small garrisons in Important town?
and a patrol along the Southern Pacific
Railway, will soon be moving irbrth

the realization that American forces
will be used to run down any raiding
band that crosses the border into the
United States regardless of where
they may have to go or how long they
may have to stay in Mexico.
It was regarded here tonight as not
improbable that a delay might be
caused by the desire of the Mexicans
to communicate further with General
Carranza. Mr. Cabrera said he and
his colleagues would report new de
velopments, and nothing may be done
until Saturday.

American "Flyers"
Have Brought Down
21 German 'Planes
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Nov. 20. American
aviators fighting with the French
forces on the western front have
brought down a total of 21 German
aeroplanes, according to Lieutenant
William Thaw, a member of the Fran
co-America aviation corps, who arriv
ed here today on the steamer La Tou-j
raine for a three weeks visit among
relatives. Lieutenant Thaw was ac-
companied by C. C. Johnson, also an
American aviator, whose home is In
New Y'ork.
"Regulations or the French army
forbid us talking or our work," Lieu-
tenant Thaw said. "My personal part
in the fighting has been told in the
cable dispatches and one of the 21
German machines brought down 19
credited to me. We heard nothing
before leaving France regarding the
request or the American govern-vent
to drop the name 'American' rrom the
Franco-American corps. All or us
have sworn allegiance to the French
government." (
Mr. Johnson said that for some time
the work of American aviators has
been confined to scouting flights. Both
of the aviators talked with Norman
Prince just prior to going on what
proved to be his last flight. They said
that he volplaned back to the French
line after an air' engagement and In
alighting his machine struck some tel
egraph wires, turning over, and he
received injuries which resulted in his
death.

NEW YORK. Nov. 20. Investiga
tion by the district attorney's office
of the higher cost of coal and rood
stuffs was under way today. Twenty
coal dealers, large and small, have
been summoned to explain what was
characterized by District Attorney
Swann as a "terrible" situation.
"The way coal prices have been
raised here is suspicious to say the
least," said Mr. Swann.
One member of a firm that Bells
3.000.000 tons annually in this city
attributed the coal shortage in Octo
ber to conditions at the mines, result
ing from a scarcity of labor. The
dealer asserted that in October he had
to go into the open market to buy
coal, paying as high as $12 a ton. Con
ditions now have returned to normal,
he said, and the wholesale price at
the mines is only a few cents a ton
higher than last year.

Message; It Deals
With Legislation
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. Presi
dent Wilson practically completed his
next annual message to congress to
day and plans to put the finishing
touches on it tomorrow. It will be
devoted almost entirely to domestic
matters and will deal primarily with
legislative questions suggested and
not finally settled.
The principal items in the message
are understood to be railroad legisla
tion to meet the situation created by
the threatened railroad strike last
August; a measure to allow American
exporters to form common selling
agencies abroad; conservation bills;
a corrupt practice bill, and the Porto
Rico bill.
Governor Arthur Yager of Porto
Rico was at the White House today

in a few days to urge that action on
the Porto Rico bill be taken before the

BALTIMORE. Nov. 20. Affiliation
of the four railway brotherhoods with
the American Federation of Labor as
a separate body was regarded as more
than a possibility tonight by influen
tial federation leaders. It was re
ported on reliable authority that rep
resentatives of the railways in he
rederation had been in conference
with officers of the brotherhoods look
ing to an affiliation of all railway men
with the federation. Two separate
organizations of railway employes
with membership in the rederation
that would give them the support or
the organized labor rorces or the coun
try In any effort to advance the inter
ests of organized railway workers,
was the plan, according to informa
tion obtained tonight.
' It has been forecast that the presi
dents of the four brotherhoods will
place their cause before the federa
tion convention at tomorrow's morn
ing session. The council already has
pointed out to the convention that the
brotherhoods were "assured of sup
port and cooperation of the American
Federation of Labor in their struggle
for the eisht hour dry."
There can be no temporary amalga
mation of organizations affiliated
with the federation and unaffiliated
bodies, however, a federation official
declared. He pointed out that the
constitution of the American Federa
tion of Labor did not permit such
amalgamation.
The only rererence to the possibili
ty or aciliation of the brotherhoods
with the rederation came rrom Presi
dent Gompers late today. It came at
the close or a three-hour debate over
what seemed to be an unimportant
matter. President Gompers said
there was involved the principle of
compulsory legislation instead of vol
untary legislation in the federation.
"Do you think that if we go hack
to' compulsion, you wi!l induce the
railroad brotherhoods to become af
filliated? Is it not more likely to
drive them away rrom us?" said Mr.
Gompers.
Some resolutions or a universal
eight hour day are being considered
by the executive committee of the
federation and the chairman expects
to report on them tomorrow.
Heads or railroad employes broth

Adamson eight hour law shall not be
broken down, conrerred here today

; adopted unanimously at the morning
session of the convention of the Ameri

These recommendations contain
provision for enlargement of the in

for compu'snrv arbitration of propos
