Owens plant on the East side In automobiles
and started immediately
their inspection of the largest machine
glass bottle works in the world.
Alter coming all the way from Toledo,
Ohio, for the purpose of seeing
the big pluut In operation, the party
was very nearly disappointed altogether,
and as it was. saw only four
machines In operation. At the time
for starting the big machines this
morning there was hut a buro ounce
af pressure In the gas mains.
Later In the day the pressure Improved
a little and at ten o'clock,
when the majority of the glass men
and capitalists began to arrive, there
was a scant two ounces pressure, i uu
four machines operated, were compelled
to run very slow because the
tas was so low that the glass could not
tie kept melted sufficiently.
The inspecting party. In groups of
[ Tour and five and six. entered the plant
1 oy the main entrance and were at once
k- attracted to one of the big machines.
It happened that the first machine was
malting whiskey bottles and much
comment was heard.
The machines which whirled their
arms from out the great pot of molten
glass and in a few operations
dumped a completed bottle into a
chute; were the chief objects of interest
to the visitors. Many of litem
were capitalists, hankers, railroad officials
and representatives of many
ather industries and this was the first
lime thev hail ever seen the manufailure
of bottles on such a large scale.
Following the slowly moving Ichrs

stacks of boxes, tilled with bottles

grape juice which many of the men
probably never heard of before; ketchup?Wagners,
Table Talk and a
number of others; Tanlae and many
other medicines. Itottles for every
trade and purpose are made in the local
factory.
From the storage rooms the party
passed through the plant of the I.ango

Nailing machines which could whirl

the main objects of interest here.
