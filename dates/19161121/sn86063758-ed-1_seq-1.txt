Prosperity, Nov. 20.?The largest,
crowd that has ever assembled in
L Prosperity gathered here Thursday
L and Friday for the community fair.
' From every standpoint this fair was
a grand success. There were hundreds
of exhibits which revealed as
.nothing else could the wonderful natural
resources of Xos. 9 and 10 townships.
Thursday morning at 10 o'clock the
^ iair association was called to order oy |
its president, Dr. G. Y. Hunter, and,
after a few introductory remarks,!

who made the welcome address. Shor.
addresses were made by Miss Edith
Parrott, state agent of home demonstration
work, Prof. S. J. Derrick of
dewberry college. Dr. C. T. Wyche and
-Hon. T. iAj. Dominick.
Thursday afternoon Mr. P. W. Moore,
l-aurens county demonstrator, explain
the working of a community
creamery before a large audience
and at the conclusion of his interesting
talk it was unanimously adopted*
that Newberry county should have a
community creamery. The capital
i stock for this creamery has already
I 3>een guaranteed.
-Friday was the banner day in which
W there were over 4,000 people to visit
thp fair. Probably the most interest
rTng feature of the day was the parade I
of 600 school children from the town
i hall to the school grounds where Hon.
-J. E. Swearingeu, state supt. of educfcttoa
delivered the principal address.
County Supt. of Education Chas. P.

GOOD VAUDEVILLE
15V NEWBERRY BOYS
Manager Wells shared fie proceeds
of the picture show at the Opera j
House Friday night with the Calvin
Crozier chapter, U. D. C. In addition
to the fine program of pictures seven
co>.ples of the local talent gave a good
vaudeville exhibition, all of which
highly amused the very large crowd
of people who attended. The vaudeville
entertainment consisted of a song
by the "Very Rev.." Whitney Purcell, |
(Xed) who wah featured as the star j
of the aggregation, a sermon by tne
"very reverend" gentleman, and l
cake walk by the fourteen. Ned was
the leader and director of the troupe.
Tlie song brought.down the house and
the sermon kept it down. The "very
reverend" added to his $png by a little
graceful dancing, which many in
the audience were not aware that he
was capable of giving with his well
known gift as a black face comedian.
He made a great hit and was encored.
After tile laugnaDle sermon came me;
cake walk, which was a source of(
much merriment to the audience, es-j
pecially to the many young ladiesi
present, who seemed to be highly j
tickled at the costumes and the acting
of the young men assuming the female
characters in the cast. Most of the
couples were hard to be traced by the
general audience, so complete were
the disguises of the black faces and
the "rigging up:" The following are
ti-io namoc of the pennies and their
statre cognomens, the second names
of the couples being the "Misses'* in
the cake walk:
Dr. John B. Setzler?George Washington.
Malcolm Johnstone?Jennie Lily
White.
Nicholas Holmes?Jacob Fuller.
Metts Fant?Susie Green.
Ferd Scurry?Sam Lamport.
John FJoyd?Susie Pushcart.
Jess Mkyes?Noah Little Fish.
Owen F^olmes?Ann Catfish.
Richard Floyd?Blue Pete Da Wait. '
Dr. E. E. Stuck?Eugenia Sharp. ;
Benedict Mayor?Nat Scaly Bark.
Ben Mayes?Marandy Ray.
Dave Caldwell?Cupid Cushion Foot. I
.lohn Peterson?Sal Sumpkin.
After all the couples had exhibited
themselves the "Very Rev. 'Whitney..
Purcell," acting as judge, awarded
Hie cake to Cupid Cushion Foot and
Sal Sumpkin, he having decided that
they had received the lion's sharp of
applause. However, all the couples
got their share of the liberal applause
of the audience. There was no kick
coming at the decision of the judge.
who seamed to be president, secre- i
tarv. general manager and treasurer
of the combination?with the cake.
Mr. Tarle Hipp at the piano, kept
the boys in live with his fine plavng.
The door recepts amounted to $50- I
50. It takes a "right smart" crowd 1
to raisp that amount at 5 and 10 cents
admission; and it shows that it pays
to put on an entertainment at popular
prices. The Calvin Crozier chapter
is ahead.

These two weeks will show the'
survival of the fittest, the reward ofj
the persevering, the honors of the sue-'

Calamity Howler has never succeeded
in anything. Doesn't want to sua*

you are not successful, if you listen
to him. He tolls you now many votes

pledge you so many subscriptions and
those who fully realize this and be
governed accordingly, will be those
who will be happiest when the campaign
is over.
Remember every Renewal Subscription
you secure this week will give
yon 5,000 extra rotes.
The campaign manager again warns
all candidates not to believe all these
scare stories-about some candidates
having enough votes up their sievesthat
would choke a Rhinoceros.
Believe nothing you hear and only
half you see. but work hard each day
and secure every available subscription
possible by Saturday night.

there will not be any extra votes offered
