night's sleep went to it with a wlll and
the day's work was highly satisfac
tory, according to the officers.
The regiment was divided into bat
talions under the commands of Majors

tire day was spent In working out de
tailed problems in preparation for next
Friday and Saturday when the whole

defense and fire control. The machine
gun company, attached to the regi

down and mount machine guns and to
pack mules. :
Day Starts Early
The dav started at 3:45 a. m. when
(the shrill notes of the bugle dragged

WASHINGTON, D. C Nov. 21.
Official circle here are frankly
alarmed over thp increasing danger of
trouble with Germany Over the sub
marine controversy which has nevr
been finally settled. The latest de
velopment in the situation came last
night with the formal announcement,
that Germany haa semi-cfficially ad
mitted that the steamer Arabia was
sunk. In the Mediterranean sea by a
German submarine without warning.
This Information has stirred official
Washington to :ts depths, -for. U bids
fair to throw open once more the
whole of the diver dispute and bring
the two nation to the verge of open
rupture once m'Jre. It is known that
President Wilson Intends taking up
the problem raised by the renewal, of
the submarine attacks by the German
divers, but so far, though there are
five caaes pending, he has not taken
any active step In the matter.
, It is believed here that there Is &
possibility that Germany will make the
Arabia a test ca3e. --

LA RKDO, Texas, Nov. 21. Accord

Chihuahua, the Vlllista bandits have
attacked the Carranzistas in that
city, and the de facto garrison is now
fighting for its. existence against the
outlaw chieftain.
These reports are unofficial and no
confirmation has been received, but It
is known that large numbers. of refu
gees are on their way to El Paso from
the city of Chihuahua and the country
surrounding that place.
In an answer filed in circuit , court

all the allegations of the complaint in

he says he will rely on the statute of
limitations.
