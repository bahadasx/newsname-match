THANKSGIVING WILL
COST A LITTLE IRE
Pendleton's Thanksgiving din
ner this year will cost more
than It did a year ago owing to
the advances In the prices of
foodstuffs, but the Increase will
not be as great as many people
suspect. The cost' of a Thanks
giving turkey this year will not
be any more than last year, ac
cording to local markets. Re
tall quotations for top dressed
turkeys vary from 28 to 30 cents,
which was about the range a
year ago.
In Portland the lowest quo
tation for No. 1 turkeys is 32
cents with No. 2 stuff selling
for several cents less. It is re
ported that turkeys are plenti
ful in the state but that other
states are drawing heavily on
the supply. One local market
is sending to Seattle today a
big shipment The price of
grain has been so high that
many of the turkeys are not
fattened up as much as In for
mer years.
Other Thanksgiving delica
cies such as cranberries, mince
meat, raisins, etc., show a rise
over last year although some of
the merchants protected their
customers by early buying.
Cranberries are selling as low
as two quarts for a quarter here
and raisins as low as 1 1 cents a
package.
