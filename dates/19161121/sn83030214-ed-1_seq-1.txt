CITY AND STATE
JOIN PRICE FIGHT
Combined Attaek Expect?
ed to Bring Cost of Liv?
ing Down Again
Practically every department of N'ew
York's state and city governments com?
bined yesterday ill an assault upon
high food prices that is expected not
only to bring the cost of living down
to something approaching normal con
ditions, but to send certain speculators
to jail.
District Attorney Swann, Mayor
Mitchel, Foods and Market Commis
i-ioner John J. Dillon and numerous de
partments with which they are associ
iited were prominent in the numerous
investigations that came to n head yes?
terday. Grand jury action againat
poultry dealers eharged with conspir
acy to rix prices will be resumed to?
morrow, the investigation of charges
of eolluaion among coal dealers still is
tn progress and reports involving
charges of short rneasures and weight?
will be made to-day.
In every case where dealers are
found to hav' wilfully conspired to
raise prices or to have gi\en short
weight. the District Attorney an?
nounced, jail sentences would be de?
manded. Such acts, he said, were lar?
ceny. ai.d were particularly reprehen
sible just now.
Hartigan Makei Suggestion
Meanwhile, tbfl numerous agencies
set in inotion by Mayor Mitchel or hii
department heads were at work devis
ing solutions of the problems that have
been aggravated by the present high
prices. The moit important of the sug
gestions made was that of Commission?
er of Wriphts anil Measure1' Joseph
Hartigan. under which the city's sub?
way eystem n ay become th* avenue
through wliuh low-priced products will
be brought to the city.
Commissioner Hartigan's -.uggestion
is that the subways be used during the
slack hours of the night and early
morning to transport supplies from the
outlying districts to the markets and
retail stores, as is done in London and
Berlin. I'nder the present system, he
pointed out, the produce * for which
greater Xew York paid $1,400,000,000
annually. was brought into Manhattan
almost excluisively by wagon?, automo?
bile trucks and, in some instances, by
hand.
The slow, costly process of sending
the city's thousands of tons of food
rnany miles from the lower end of
Manhattan Ifllaod where the bulk of
it is deposited by ti.e producers v. as
said to be archaic ?.'.<l tar behind the

Mr. Hartigan. "I ar.i BOt ei.ougii of

Aaierican Flying Corp; serving with
the French on thc western front, ar
rirad yeeterday on La Touraine from
BordOBUX, o:i a three weeks' l??ave of i
absence in thi, country.
Lieutenant T aw, although modestly
d.clining to talk about his own ex-'
ploits, told of the splendid work being
performed by other Americans who are
under his command. "I am glad to
deny in person the rumors of my death.
which several Ameriean papers pub
lished recently," he said, smiling, "but
my greutest regret is that I was not
able to arrive ia time to help root for
?he Yale team when we beat Prince?
ton last Saturday."
When ask. d what i.etion the French
government hai! taken in regard to the
recent commumcation from th. State
Department, asking that the name
Franco-American Flying Corpa be
changed to something more neutral,
Lieutenant Thaw stated that it was
only in the United States that that
natUt existed. "Oiir official title is
Escadrille N-124, the 'V standing for
N'ieuport, which is the make of ma?

the lightest and fastest maehine now
being used by the Allies. It surnasses
anything that the Germans have in the
way of aircraft, including their fai
famed Fokker.

"It is generally conecded that tlie ,
Americans flying on thc western front,

appear that B!l aviators on a battle
front run practically the >am? risk"
This is not true, since there are several
branches of the air service which nevei
approach tiie front.
"War aviation is divided into numer?
ous brar.rhes. ft includes aviators who
carry nies^ages from one camp to an?
other, those who bring aeroplanes to
the fields at the fron*. from the hangars
and factories in the rear, range t.nders
the eyes of the artillery and still I
others who belong to the raiding squad- ,
rons, driving large machines carrying
r.iany bombs and projectiles. Our squad?
ron belongs to none of these classes, i
but is known as the K'cadrille de '
Chasse.
"H is our duty to go aloft the
moment the observers stationed in the
front line trenches announce the ap
proach of an enemy aircraft. Wfl have
either to bring our opponent down or
force him to turn back to his own
lines. Failure to do one or the other :
means disgrace.

"We Americans fly alone, continued
the lieutenant. "Our left hand guides
the machine, while our right operates .
the machine gun. In the Nieuport ma
ehifll there is not sufflcient space for!
a gunner, whose added weight would
lessen the speed of the aeroplane, and
:n a tight place it is the machine which
has the greatest speed that usually .
comes out the victor.

Atlantic <-ity, Nov. 20.?A virtual I
ultimatum will be delivered to-morrow
tfl Carranza's representatives by the
Ameriean members of the joint Mexi
can commission. They will be told the j
only terms upon which the I'nited |
States will agree to withdraw the
Pershing coiumn from Mexico, and '
they will be required to accept those
terms before the commission proceeds
to consider othrVr phases of the prob?
iem before it.
If they reject the plan proposed by
the I'nited States the Americans will
abandon the conferences. If they ask
for time to communicate with their
first chief lt will be granted, but the
Americans will make it plain that
undue delay will not be tolerated.
Franklin K. Lane, chuirman of the
Amencan section of the -ommission,
returned this afternoon from Washing?
ton, where he went to confer arith
President Wilson. He acquainted the j
President with the dimculty encoun- ;
tered by the Ameriean commissioners
hecaus. of the Mozicafl unwillingness
to meet the I'nited Sta'es half way in '
th- lalutiefl of the dirTerence. between j
the two countries. He brought to the :
Preside.U's coiuideration the border;
protectioh plan evolved by him and
bia Ameriean colleagues and recently]
ubmitted to the Mexicans. and was
upheld in his contention that the plan
waa 'air tfl Mexico and should be ac- ,
cepted by Carranza.
Mexican Propoaal Kejected
i
A counter proposal offered by the j
Mexican envoys also was submitted to '
Preaident Wiban. This provided.
among other things, for a neutral zone
between tlie two countries, in which
the troops of botli governments might
operate again-' maraudeu. The plan j
called for half of the zone to be in :
Mexico and the other half in the |
I'nited States. This proposal was re
garded unfavorably by the President,
v.ho upheld the plan . uggested by the
Ameriean comniis-ioners.
Details of the plan are v. itiiheld. but!
it is understood to provide: First, the |
recall of Per.-.hing's troop-* to the j
Amencan aide of the border; second,
the concentrati .n of Carran_;<U forces
territory evacuated by Pershing;
third, the establishment of adequate de
facto government patrols at strategie
along the frontier. A fourth
proriaion is that the I'nited Statea
icrcos in case of neces.-ity shall be
permitted by Mexicc ta cntei Me\ican
territory to pur-ue bandit**.

London, Nov. 20.?The Rumanian
army in Western Wallachia is in
grave danger of bein.g surrounded.
Driving castward along the Ursovi
Craiova railway, Kalkenhayn'a
southern army has cut in on the rear
of the Rumanian forces defending
the passes of Northern Wallachia.
The Teutons are now approaching
Craiova, the stronghold of South
western Rumania, and threatening
at any moment to cut off the retreat
ol* Ferdinand's army.
Definite details of the new Teuton
advance are lacking. Yesterday Ber?
lin announced that thr Austro-Ger
man troops had struck down from
the region ncrth ut* tho Iron (?at* of
the Danube and had reached the
Craiova railroad. To-night'i official
statement from Berlin hrierly istate*
that the invaders are "approaching
Craiova."
Retreating Into Trap
How near they are to the city ik a
matter of speculation, in view of the
scant details at hand. It is virtually
certain, however, that the TwattM
are well in the rear of the Rumanian
army.
It ii not the movement east ot Or?
sova alone that endanger* the Ru
manians. It is the combinat'o-i of mat
opiration v. ith th? iteadiiy piogressing
Teutor. offensive in the Jiul nml Al'
vallfjs. Pitrograd admits to .vgh*
that the R-m-inianii are still filling
baek in the Jiul Valley straight into
the jaws of the enerny's trap.
The capture of Craiova wcild be a
vital blow to the hopes of HucharoM.
The whole western part of Rumania
would be lopped off fiom the mmt
body. the Germanic front would be
shortened hundreds of miles allov ;ng

points and a thruct against the cap?

of the operations in this sector made
public. Mackensen, it is believed, has
received reinforcementi that have cn
abled him to check the advance of the
Russo-Rumanian forces toward the
Constanza-Cerna.oda line.
