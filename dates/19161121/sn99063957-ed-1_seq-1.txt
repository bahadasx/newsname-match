London, Nov. 21. Another Russian offe "give along
the line from Constanza to Cernovada is now; ircpected to
increase the intensity of the fighting in t! q Balkans.
Military experts here today agreed this was the only step
which could be relied upon to lessen the. weight of General
Von Falkenhayn's tremendpus pressure on the Wallach
ian frontier of Rumania a pressure which it is now ad
- nutted constitutes the gravest menace to Rumania.
The Rumanian army is in the greatest danger of being
outflanked, if the German official statement specifying
near approach of the Teutons to Craiova is accurate. The
Rumanians are being forced back from the valley of the
Jiul.-Meanwhile Falkenhayn, with a force estimated at
half a million men, is sweeping around their rear, stead
ily lessening the gap through which they must retreat
and circumscribing that line of retreat so that its direc
tion, apparently, must be due east.
Unless there was n diversion snmrnvriAVA in the TSnllran
campaign to stop Von Falkenhayn's thrust it appeared
aimost certain toaay mat complete evacuation oi tne
western part of Rumania would be necessary to save the
Rumanian army. This diversion, it is admitted, can best
be made by the Russians because of the ease of transport
ing reinf oreements via the Black sea.
Hope was also expressed here today

TO BE ANSWERED
E
Intimation Is That General
Strike May Not Fellow
Present Dispute
MAY SOON UNITE WITH
FEDERATION OF LABOR
Railroads Want To Get Rid of
Control by State Railroad
Commissions
By Carl D. Groat.
(I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Baltimore, Md-, Nov. 21. "There's
going to be an eight-hour day on the
railroad! or there's some unfinished
business before this country."
In this manner todav Warren S. Stone
head of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
tngineers, answered the question of
whether the rail road brotherhoods will
call a strike if pending injunction pro
ceedings tin up the operation of the
Auamson eight-hour law.
Speaking in responso, to an enthus
iastic welcome given himself and the
heads of three other brotherhoods by
the delegates to tho American Federa
tion of 1-abor convention, Stone declar
ed:
"Labor will wntch from the sidelines
while the railroads fight their own gov
ernnieut. " -
Kfforts to obtain from- the other
brotherhood leaders nil expression of
their purpose in the matter were fruit -
less, notwithstanding President Gomp-
er's assertion from the platform
"We expect thobrotherhoods on the
iinu iiay or junusrv to inaugurate tne
eight ho"ur da." ' 7
Affiliation of the brotherhoods with
the American Federation of Labor with
ia a short time seemed likely at the
conclusion of tho four leaders' visit
to tho convention.
A general railroad strike January 1
may not follow as the result of the pres
ent situation growing out of the Adam
ion law dispute.
This interpretation was placed today
on remarks of thief Stone of the Hroth
erhood of Locomotive Engineers that
the question of such a strike "will be
answered later." Tho element of doubt
regarding his remarks arises from the
fact that last week in New York, broth
erhood chiefs flatfootedlv said there
would be a strike if they did not get a
real eight hour day.
W1U Await Test.
Now it is believed, the brotherhoods
will be content to await a test of eon
stitutionnlity of the Adamson eight hour
measure. The brotherhoods, however,
are shrouding their movements in an ev
en deeper secrecy than that which mark
ed their ppogrnm when they threatened
strike last summer-
Today the brotherhood chiefs are in
Baltimore to speak before the American
Federation of Labor convention a
move that portends cooperation be
tween them and the railway department
of the federation o force an eight hour
day in all branches of railroad service.
At the same time, the department of
justice, and the brotherhoods' legnl de
partment are ready for the opening of
the Adamson tests Thursday when the
Union Pacific and Santa Fb start their
suits at Kansas City. The course taken
by the crew in these cases will be vitr.l
and upon its action will probably rest
the final decision of the brotherhoods
as to whether there shall be a strike.
The Newlnndj committee investiga
tion of the general subjects of rela
tions between railroads nud the general
public will continue with the rnilroads
putting forth proposals for alleviation
of what they regard as an irksome con
dition. They will fight particularly for
elimination of control by state railroad
commissions.
The question of wages has been min
imized to date but when brotherhood
leaders return, they prubablv will nsk
a hearing and precipitate sharp discus
sion on that point.
Labor Is TJunafraid.
Baltimore, Md., Nov. 21. Any ex
Ifctation thut an affiliation of the Big
Four brotherhoods and the American
Federation of 1-abor might be the re
sult of these two bodies mutual fight
for the eight hour day and the unlimited
right to stWke, was dampened here tn
day when Wnrreu h. Stone, head of the
engineers addressed the federation con
vention. "We arc not allied with the Amer
ican Federation of Labor and only be
cause of jurisdictional disputes that
would at once arise in ease such alliance
blioalj come to pass. That is the reason '
uud that alone," he said.
- Stone was the first of the four broth
erhood representatives to speak.
"I eome with a message of good will
from the locomotive engineers," he
said. "We four executives are thor

LATER SAYS
Tl
T
Keynote Is: "Prepare To Meet
Unprecedented Conditions
After War"
WANTS LARGER NAVY TO
HELP ENFORCE PEACE
Would Modify Sherman Law
to Permit Organization
of Exporters
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Nov. 21. A call to Am
erican business to meet tiuprecendented
trade conditions after the war, is to be
the keynote of President Wilson's mes
sage to congress Tuesday, December 5.
The president is completing tho message
today and expects soon to have it in the
hands of the printer.
The president believes the country's
industries can do a maximum amount
of work only when there is a minimum
of industrial unrest. , His message is ex
pected to emphasize this in an appeal
to employers and employe for more co
operation, moro confidence of each, in
the other and less tendency to class feel
ing. Iu this connection the president has
formulated plans for rendering practi
cally impossible strikes of all kinds. He
will urge completion of a program sim
ilar to that proposed in his last mes
j - age to handle such situations as the
recent threatened strike of the railroad
brotherhoods. ,
Believing the railroad problem as im-
portant a domestic issue as confronts
tne country, tne president will urce
congress to give the most careful con
sideration to possible legislation which
will allow the transportation systems to
expand and to improve to meet the ad
ditional stress under which they will
be placed at the elose of the war."
Abroad also, the foundations must be
laid for the trade upheaval, the prei
dent believes. He will urec congress to
act immediately upon a measure along
mo lines oi ine vicdd Dill, which would
have permitted American exporters to
organize without fear o anti-trust law
action.
In addition to these the president 'c
message will urge action upon different
measures recommended in his message
oi a year ago and which are ti 1 on
the list of the administration's "un
finished business." They are expected
to include:
Conservation laws: legislation for ren
dering fuller political justice to the peo
ple of Porto Rico, a corrupt practices
act, federal aid nnd stimulation to in
dustrial and vocational education like
that given in the field of agricultural
industry and posBibly laws giving fed
eral agents more effective weapons to
use in ueaung witn conspirators against
the neutrality of the government..
tne president also probably will urge
continuation of "preparedness for
peace" by continuance of a progres
sive program of national defense includ-
ng material additions to the navy. In
his recent pleas for the union of na
tions to prevent future wars, the presi
dent has pointed but that if America is
to play her part in enforcing this pence,
she must have the neeessarv means.

Young Bandits Held Un

. Saa Francisco, Nov. 21. i A dragnet

an effort to capture the five youthful
bandits who attempted the most daring
robbery San Francisco lfas known in
years last night when they invaded the
exclusive racitic inion club and held
up all with whom they came in contact.
The net proceeds of their adventure
was about t20 in silver. They failed
to get $2,000 in gold which was in the
cash drawer because they lost their
nerve at the critical moment-
The youths were evidently amateurs.
Driving up to the club wnrch Is on the

rooms where the wealthy members were.
They were panic stricken when they

A statement from"She London office
of the Belgian dejiartment of justice
made these - assertions today.
"The deportations of Belgian sub
jects continue without respite," the
statement asserted. "The council of

cause they refused to communicate
lists of unemployed to the German au
thorities. Deportations are proceeding
in tno province or iiainauit and in
Wells and Flanders. Subjects of tho

Chicago, Nov. 21 Wealthy church

"Such action will take from liquor
men the argument that tho saloon is the

He acknowledged his change of mind

"But I changed because I found
liquor interests wouldn't adjust them
