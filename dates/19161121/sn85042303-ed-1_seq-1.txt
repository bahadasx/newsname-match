PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATIONS

Washington, Nov. 21. President

In his August addresn, the president
made six recommendations, two of
which were for an eight-hour day o
the railroads and for a commission
to observe the operation of the law.
The others were no' acted on.
The provisions remaining to be acr
ed upon and which will be renewed
by the president. Include a provision

Of course there are many who have
subscribed to the toll road fund who
will be gone before the trees bo

a pecan tree when once matured is a

set them out now would be planting

A casual look at the matter and
the seeming difficulties of the pro
position vanishes. Trees of this
character should be se( at least one

George W. Perkins, chairman of the
food supply commission instituted by
Mayor Mitchel of New York City, sent
a letter to Governor Whitman of New
York in which he said:
The cost of living has been steadily
increasing for a number of years. Of
course to Increase our output and the
quality of it Is very desirable, and 1
know of no class of citizens who have
tried harder to do this than the farm

consumers know that the high cost of
living Is not entirely due to the fact
that we have failed to raise enough
food. The fundamental trouble is
that we have not at Washington, or
Albany, or New York City, or any
where else, the right kind of market

will be able to make twice or three
times the number of trips it will be

there will be from' the road.
Apart from the outlook from a
