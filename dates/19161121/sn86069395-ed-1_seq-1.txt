Louisville, Ky., Nov. 20. Proba
bly no greater, or more serious polit
ical problem ever confronted the peo
ple of Kentucky than that which has
developed here this week in the de
mand of certain powerful influences
within the democratic party for a sub
mission by the legislature to the vot
ers of Kentucky constitutional amend
ments for the establishment of prohi
bition and woman's suffrage.
Tne effect of this unexpected ('ev.'r
opment, coming suddenly and imme'
diately after the national election, it
appears, however,- was not the re
suit of "snap judgment," but rather
a carefully considered and matured
plan for the settlement, for all time to
come, of these two questions.
The situation is clearly set forth in
The Times, which asserts the belief
that the agitation of these issues has
"reached a point where their settle
ment will do more to clear the air of
Kentucky, politically and commerci
ally, than any other agency." While
the suffra.Ee question is not consider
ed very seriously in fact is viewed
more of A fa0th$n an issue there
seems to be a grim, determination to
rid politics in Kentucky of the thorn
of prohibition, which, undoubtedly
would be a point gained toward bet
ter government.
In brief, Kentucky democracy has
shown what it can do when united,
and there is every indication that this
movement to submit the amendments
to the voter for a decision will sue
ceed thus in removing them as ob
structions to legislative progress and
at the same time obviate any menace
of a division in the .party in the fu
ture.
However, it is not possible to take
anyjcgislative action before the regu
lar session of the legislature in juio.
In the meantime the people of the
state will have full opportunity to
view the prohibition ouestion from
all angles before casting their vote m
1919, which would be the earliest an
election could be held, provided the
legislature decided upon a submission
of the amendments.
A veritable cyclone of discussion,
views and opinions has fallowed
these proposals.

Wilson formally by proclamation des-
gnated Thursday, November 30, as
