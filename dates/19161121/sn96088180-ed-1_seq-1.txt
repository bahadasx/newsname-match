through most -of the day to bridge
the gap of swirling waters and take
the men and women off the ship.
Two or three times the lifeboats were
capsised In the surf, several life
savers narrowly escaping drowning.
Late today, however, the Walmer
crew succeeded In getting a line
aboard the Siberia. The American
