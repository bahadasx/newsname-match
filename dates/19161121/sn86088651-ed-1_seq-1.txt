Evenly Matched and Hard Fought Games
Ever Seen in Bryan Spectators Thrilled as
They Watched the Game From Period to
Period.
The headline above tells the story
of the hardest foiiKht football game
of the Bcason In Hryun yesterday af
ternoon between the Allen Academy
team and the Houston High School
team. The game wan a battle royul
right from the Mart, both tennis hav
ing about all they could manage. The
fact Is,, you would have a hard time
picking two teams in Texus that are
any more evenly matched.
The Houston boys, a gentfumanly
crowd In every particular, was under
the direction of their roach, Mr. Leslie
Spoonts, who evidently lias consider
able knowledge of tho national sport
from the training he has i;lven the
young men from Houston.
Coach Hudson of the Allen team
was a close observer on the side line
and urged his men every way possi
ble to victory, but when the whistle
blew at the end of the game. In spite
of this fact, the score was Allen 0
and Houston High 0.
The pleasure of the game was mar
red to considerable extent from the
spectators' point of view on account
of several squabbles that camo up.
First Haf.
Allen kicked to Houston at the be
ginning of the game and the ball was
kept In safo territory for both sides
until the end of the first quarter. In
the second quarter things got very ex
citing when the left halfback on the
Houston team got loose and had a
clear, open field for a goal, but Cap
tain Dcl.afose of the Allen team out
sprinted him and he was downed on
the 20 yard line. After holding Hous
ton for dow ns, the Allen boys complet
ed t forward pass which netted them
35 yards, the ball bring received by
Newman. After a few line bucks,
time was called for the first half and
the ball was two feet off the 50 yard
line.
Second Half.
Houston kicked to Allen and the
ball was received by Del.afosse. who
advanced 20 yards. Allen lost the ball
by attempting a forward pass. Hous
ton then opened up and advnnccd the
ball to the Syard line, where they
were held for downs and Allen kicked
out of danger, the hall being near the
center of the field hn the third
quarter was over. In the Inst qunrter
the Allen boys had the west goal to

THE EAGLE'S CREEDS.
No. 7. Simplicity
Be simple in the language which you use in print Es
pecially in advertising. The world is full of very simple
people.
Use common words short sentences so all may com
prehend. Erase yourself. Make no attempt to impress your own
capacity.
Let no unique phrase, no happy turn, take attention from
the product that you talk.
The ad-writer is anonymous, and should be. That mvi
is selling merchandise, not literary style.
Don't seem to strain after effect.
Hide your effort to sell. Such effort, when apparent,
creates a resistance.
Be brief. Folks won't listen to a salesman long. Say
nothing which doesn't count
Stop when you finish. Don't repeat. Printed words are
costly.
Make your first words your headlines strike the very
heart of your subject
Don't mix major and minor claims. Little claims belittle
all. And paltry qualities, when cited, suggest the lack of
great ones.
