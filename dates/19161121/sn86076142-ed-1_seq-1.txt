Further Negotiations With Carranza May Be Abandoned Scon
CONFERENCE AT SCUTE STAGE
OVER WITHDRAWING TROOPS
(Br Associated Preaa.) I
ATLANTIC CITY; Nov. 21. The American commissioners gave
the Mexicans what is understood to be the last chance for an
amicable settlement today. At the joint session, Secretary Lane
declared the punitive expedition would be withdrawn in reasonable
time under conditions that would not impair American government
or leave the border unprotected. lie made it clear that the United
States will not tolerate restrictions in pursuit of bandits. The
Mexican response is not known.
The atmosphere of uncertainty and eveu hopelessness which has
been apparent for many weeks was entirely lacking today. The
Americans appeared confident that the end of the conference is in
sight. Their propositions have been reduced to writing and it is
understood will admit of little debate.
The Mexicans appeared not to take a pessimistic view of the
hituation, Mr. Cabrera again assuring newspaper men that he was
very hopeful of an amicable adjustment. There was no evidence,
Vowever, that he was prepared to recede from his position so long
maintained that agreement to the plan of the Americans was out
of the quest in.

Whether Ignaeio Bonillaa and Alberto J. Pani, the other members
of the Mexican commission, were prepared to stand by Mr. Cabrera
could not be determined. They have been disposed of late to agree
with the Americans on the plan suggested and it was the opposition
of Mr. Cabrera that prevented a settlement.
The more debatable question is the method of controlling the
border after troops have been taken out. The Mexicans will not be
permitted to place restrictions on the manner in which the American
government may protect its border nor on the manner in which it
may punish marauding bandits.
The Mexicans have objected seriously to acknowledging the right
of the United States to send troops across the international boundary
in pursuit of bandits, but have been more insistent that in case
troops are sent they be moved subject to certain restrictions.
When the Mexican commissioners leave here' if will be with the
realization that American forces will be used to run down any
raiding band that crosses the border into the United States, regard
less of where they .may have to go or how long they may have to
stay in Mexico.' ' r ,
