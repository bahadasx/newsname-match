Armies of Rumania Hard Pressed by the
Teutonic Invaders
Oil THE MACEDONIA! Fill
The Teutonic invaders by bold and
rapid strokes apparently have captur
ed a large section of Northwestern
Wallachia from the Rumanians. Pet
rcgrad announced a Rumanian retire
ment in Filliash. Judging from re
cent reports this means the Teutonic
forces are moving southward in the
Jiul valley and eastward along the
railway from Orsova, compelling the
Rumanians to withdraw from ' the
Orsova region and retreat rapidlyin
the Jiul valley to prevent being cut
off. Whether even this rapid retreat
has been in time to save these Ruman
ian armies is made doubtful by the
German announcement that Teutonic
forces are before Craiova, as the
Craiova-Bucharest railroad i3 the -only
convenient line of retirement from the
Jiul valley and Orsova armies.
Berlin said Russian attacks were
repulsed north of Campulung. The
Rumanians resisting heavily, yielded
important positions to the Teutons in
the Alt. valley south of Rothenthurm
pass. , . "
North of Monastir, Serbia, Berlin
reported the entente forces feeling out
the Teutonic positions. Berlin said
Serbian attacks east of Monastir were
repulsed. ' , ".
Only artillery battles have occurred
in Northern France.
SERBS ADVANCE STEADILY
London,? Nov. 21. The Serbians
continued in pursuit of the German
and Bulgarian forces on the Macedon
ian front, capturing several -villages
and taking a great number of prison
ers, said Reuter's Saloniki corres
pondent. The Teutons received rein
forcements and offered severe resist
ance. '

Paris, Nov. 21. The allies are

retired under Teutonic attacks to the

Union will stand by 1 its friends
wherever it finds them", declared
President Charles S. Barrett, address
ing the annual convention of the nat
ional farmers' organization which op
ened here today.
"The Union has never been in par
tisan politics and will not be", con
tinued Mr. Barrett. "Yet right here
you may take it from me sthat no
amount of partisan lashing shall
drive the Union from the support of
its friends nor force it to sustain its
political enemies. Knowing itself, its
powers and limitations, the Union is
determined to control itself. This
simply means that the Union is not go
ing to take its orders and directions
fiom the outside. It means that the
Union is sane, self-sustgining and
self-sufficing. It will fearlessly and
steadfastly exercise its power for the
betterment of the Union, the produc
ers of life's necessities, and the uplift
of the human race."
Mr. ' Barrett : warned the Union
against pretended friends "who, when
the important moment comes do not
hesitate to dodge the issue."
J As an indication of the growth of
the Farmers' Union during the year,
President Barrett said charters had
been granted to, two new state organ
izations, Montana and North Dako
ta and three others were nearly ready.
Equally important, he pointed out, was
the steady development of the Union's
cooperative business enterprises which
were getting better and - more " sub
stantial results practically every
where.;: . . .- r '. '-
"If we would earn moreas produc
ers of wealth, we must learn more
as wealth producers," said Mr. Bar
rett. "We must know enough i to co
operate to secure and realize the
equitable worth of our work."
Through the efforts of organized
farmers, Mr. Barrett declared, the ru
ral free delivery, the parcels post, the
new rural credits law and better ru
ral schools had been achieved. What
had been accomplished was nothing

Mexicans this Afternoon Given Last
' Chance to Settle Border Trouble

made it clear no restrictions should be

MARKET REPORTS
Editor Star: Considering the in
terest that Marion county has in live
stock, I believe it would be a good
scheme for you to give Cincinnati, St.
Louis and Birmingham market re
ports. If you can do this, you can say
that you give the best live stock mar
ket reports of any paper in Florida.
The Times-Union gives Chicago live
stock markets, but Cincinnati and St.
Louis, either, are better hog markets
than Chicago. Most people think-Chicago
is the market of the United
States, but if you can watch the daily
reports for a week,'you will find Cin
cinnati often -cent per pound better
on .hogs than Chicago, and ,it run3
ahead the year through, and we want
to ask Jacksonville to pay the Cincin
nati prices, less different in freight.
Give this a little thought, and see if
you can't make it a feature you can
brag about and gain in circulation.
S. H. Gaitskill.
Mcintosh, Nov 20.
Good advice, Mr. Gaitskill, but said
market reports would cost the Star
from $10 to $15 a week in telegraph
tolls. Do you think it could make its
money back ?

One of the other partners was taken
very ill an hour before Mr. Frank had
to leave New York; and the third
member of the firm had to be recall

says hi3 business in Ocala, during his
absence is far -better than he antici
pated and he is more than pleased
with the business the store is doing.
He left implicit instructions with his

not less than a quarter-page adver
tisement for Frank's Store in every
issue of the Weekly- Star and Weekly
Eanner till after the first of the year,
