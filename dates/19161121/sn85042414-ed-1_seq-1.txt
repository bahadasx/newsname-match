writer, and Clara Jobnson, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. K. H. Johnson, 621
Sixth avenue, were married in. Chi
cago this morning. Mrs. Johnson re
ceived a telegram early this afternoon
announcing their marriage at 11

as a surprise to even Clark's closest

Information. She even withheld the
name of the groom.

Minneapolis, where she met Clark.
They then went to Chicago and the
marriage took place there this morn
ing.
Clark and his bride will spend a
month in New York and in January
will depart, with Governor and Mrs
L. B. Hanna and other friends, for
Germany. Upon their return from
Europe, the Clarks will make their
home in Bismarck, where Jim Jam
.Tems is published.
Since the first issue of Jim Jam
Jems, and, especially since the federal
government's attempt to deqy the
privilege of Inter-state carriage for
the magazine, Clark haB' fieeorrte na
tionally known. His magazine, lrhl'ch
he first published Ifi January, "i.912,
circulates throughout the country and
is one of the most widely known pert*
Odicals.
Before going to Bismarck, Clark
was a resident of Minot, where he
published The Reporter. At one time,
he was mayor of Minot.
The bride is well known in Grand
Forks.

SPEAKERSHIP
Republicans May Balk on
Mann and Tammany
May Divide Dems.
Washington, Nov. 21.—Affairs are
lining up for a spectacular struggle
for control of the house in the 65th
congress.
On the face of the returns there are
three more Republicans than Dem
ocrats, but six independents and mem
bers of other parties hold the balance
of power. Beneath the surface, how
ever, forces are operating which may
make this balance of power negligible.
It transpires that some Progressive
Republican members are threatening
to bolt the Republican caucus and
refuse to vote for James R. Mann
for speaker. Half a dosen such bolters
might enable the Democrats to eleot
the speaker.
At the same time Tammany con
gressmen may bolt In sufficient num
bers to enable the Republicans to
elect a speaker. If the administration
lights Tammany, in the mayoralty
election In Nejr York next fall. Tam
many will be likely to bolt In the
organisation of the house.
The opposition to Manh Is based on
the fact that be hai been affiliated
with the old crowd of Cannon con
gressmen and that he was one of
Uncle Joe's right hand men in the
sensational rules controversy in the
house several years ago.
Among the persons who have been
.mentioned -as possible opponents of
Mann are Lenroot of Wisconsin, Gard
ner of Massachusetts, Graham of
Pennsylvania and Mondell of Wyom

DEMOCRATS TO ASK
MINNESOTA RECOUNT
St. Paul, Nov. 21.—Fred E. Whea
ton, Democratic Btate chairman, de
clared that if a recount of Minne
sota's vote on president is demanded,
it will not be because of any suspicion
of fraud.
"In view of the closeness of the
vote, it might be as well to have a
recount, to, assure everybody of the
correctness of the result," he said.
"I hold highly the integrity of Min
nesota voters, and there has been no
hint or suspicion on my part of any
fraud or serious irregularity.
"If one is demanded, it wilt be sim
ply because a margin of 396 in a total
vote of nearly 160,000 is too Amall to
be a certainty. A. change of 200
votes would overturn it, and errors,
are sure to be discovered. They might
turn the count either way, but there
is a good chance for us to win the
Btate. We could hardly be expected
to concede it when Mr. Hughes has
not conceded California."

Business Men Already Pre

Leading From City.
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 21.—Dickinson
bids fair to become a big railroad
center of western North Dakota, as a
result of the initiative of the farmers
and business men in promoting three
independent projects, preliminary
surveys for which have already been
completed, or are how under \ray.
The. three lines are:
-DlCklhson to Now England to Mott.
Dickinson'to Blerntan.
Dickinson to a point forty miles
northwest.
The Equity Engineering company
at
Fargo is the contracting company for
the handling of each of the three sur
veys.
Dickinson is in the heart of a big
district that is not adequately sup
plied by railroads, and tho^buslness
men there determined to take the in
itiative in putting the city on the map.
Since the people have shown so
much interest In the proposition, it
has been reported that the Northern
Pacific had become interested in a
plan for an extension south from
Dickinson. Another plan credits the
N. P. with being interested in an ex
tension of the Mandan-Mott line to
Marmarth, newly selected county seat
of Slope county.
Still another southwestern railroad
project Is the proposed extension of
the Milwaukee line from New England
to Amldon.
In northwestern North Dakota, the
Wildrose line will be opened for op
eration this week.
The Wildrose extension runs from
Wildrose to Grenora, and rails have
been laid the entire distance.
All along the extension, there has
been intense activity in building pro
jects, with the result that the line
opens up with real business prospects
right off the Jump.
Big celebrations are planned In the
several towns.

WILSON RENEWS
LAW DEMANDS
Message Takes
Question Ready to
Fight Big Cases.
Washington, Nov. 21.—President
Wilson's recommendation for railroad
legislation in his address to congress
will be practically the same as those
embodied in his special address last
August, when the nation-wide rail
road strike was pending. Wilson dis
cussed some of the details today with
his cabinet.
In his special address, the president
made six specific recommendations,
two providing for an eight-hour day
as the legal basis of work and of
wages on railroads, and for a com
mission to observe the operation of
the law being embodied in the Adam
son act.
Attorney General Gregory said at
today's cabinet meeting that the gov

railroad brotherhoods for effecting
general betterment of labor, was urg
ed today before the federation con
vention by brotherhood heads and
President Gompers.
Delegates crowded the hall, cheer
ing the speakers* enthusiastically.
"We must hang together, or we will
hang separately," W. G. Lee, spokes
man for the brotherhoods and head
of the Railway Trainmen, declared.
Gompers said: "It is a great com
fort to know that the time is not far
distant when the great brotherhoods
will be a part of the American Fed
eration of Labor."
Lee declared that some sort of af
filiation should be affected to fight
any proposed arbitration legislation,
which might be unfair to labor. Wil
son plans such legislation, Lee said,
and it should be carefully watched. He
declared that congress had no right
to pass any law compelling a man to
work, provided he is not in prison, if
he did not want to and he did not
think it would do.
Prolonged cheering followed some
praise of Wilson by Lee.
More Than Possibility.
Baltimore, Md., Nov. 21.—Affilia
tion of the four railroad brotherhoods
with the American Federation of
Labor as a separate body was re
garded as more than a possibility
today by influential federation lead
ers. It was reported on reliable au
thority that representatives of the
railway department of 'the-Sedenrtloh
been ln
of the brotherhoods looking to an
affiliation of all railway men with
the federation. Two separate organi
zations of railway employes with
membership in the federation that
would give them the support of the
organized labor forces of the country
in any effort to advance the interests
of all organized railway workers, was
the plan, according to information
obtained today.
There can be no temporary amal
gamation of organizations affiliated
with the federation and unaffiliated
bodies, however, a federation official
declared. He pointed out that the
constitution of the American Federa
tion of Labor did not permit such
amalgamation.
The only reference to the possibil
ity of affiliation of the brotherhoods
with the federation coming from
President Gompers was made yester-
association as against voluntary as
sociation in the federation. On the
principle of voluntary association, he
said, the federation had grown and
thrived. Had the old principle of
compulsion remained in force, the
bricklayers, machinists and other
strong unions would never have affili
ated with the federation, he said.
