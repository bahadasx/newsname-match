ATLANTIC CITY, N. J.. Nov. 21.
The American commissioners today
gave to thr Mexican commissioners
what is understood tn be (be last rp
portunity (or an amicable settlement
of the problems that have arisen be
came of Carranra's failure to provide (
adequate protection tor me aim prnp
erty along the international bonier.
Withdrawal Promised.
In joint session Secretary of In
terior I.ane. as chairman of the Amer
ican commission, informed Mr. Car
rama's renresentatives that the Amer
ican punitive expedition would be
withdrawn within a .reasonable lime
s"tT(l under condition that would not
impair the dimity of the American
government or leave unprotected tlit
territory just south of the boundary
now patroled by the Americans. In
cident to such withdrawal, he outlined
the manner in which the American gov
ernment was prepared to guard the
long line of frontier and to run down
and punish any marauding band that
attempted a crossing into the United
States. It i clear to the Mexicans
that this government will not tolerate
any restrictions on the pursuit of ban
dits by American troops.
Attitud Not Known.
How Luis Cabrera, chairman of thr
Mexican commission and his colleagues
received what is regarded as the last
word of the American commissioners
was not expected so be. know witil
after the session came to an end this
fternoon. Steady opposition to the
filan of Mr. Cabrera and continued
nslstence that further activities of
American troops in Mexico must be
restricted in various ways have marktd
the conferences of the joint commis
sion for many weeks and it was the
apparent determination of the Mexican)
not to yield that caused Mr. Lane b
place before President Wilson all the
facts in the rase.
Mexicans May Secede.
When he went into the conference
this morning he carried with him the
assurance of the president that he had
the unratified backing of his plans.
The Mexicans were aware of the presi
dent's attitude and it was regarded as
probable that they would recede irom
the position that they had taken.
The Mexican commissioners retired
to their own rooms for consideration of
the American proposition and were
still secluded when the American dele
gates adjourned until afternoon.
The reception of the plan by the
Mexicans was unmarked by comment.
No debate was engaged in, the Mexi
cans quietly suggesting that they would
meet the Americans after further study
ing the plan. Whether the Mexicans
will be prepared to return again today
it was not indicated

Cold Weather
Is Predicted
For Tonight
Mercury May Drop to 28 De
grees Above Zero; Rain
in Many Sections.
Rain buckets full of it -fell on Ok
lahoma City and 1(),(KX) delegates and
visitors to the Oark Trails conven
tion this morning.
Rut the precipitation dampened noth
ing but the clothes of the trailers. The
initiative and enthusiasm they displayed
in yesterday's remarkabt? parade was
not diminished in the least.
Rain in Many Parts.
According to reorts at the weather
bureau, today's rain is fairly general
over the slate. A slight rainfall is re
ported as far west as Amarillo. At II
o'clock th:s morning the precipitation
in Oklahoma City had amounted to
.45 inch. It is probable if the rain con
tinues that roads in this civinity will be
pretty had1 cut up by heavy travel
occasioned by the convention, and that
nuulerous trail delegates will be com
pelled to leave their cars in local
garages and with friends in the city
until brighter weather prevails.
Cold Weather Predicted.
Freering weather with a temperature
of between ?8 and M degrees is fore
cast by the weather bureau for tonight.
Wednesday's forecast provides for fair
but continued cold weather.
The 3,(XX) automobiles which had ar
rived last night had nearly all been
stored in garages this morning. A few,
however, ' were parked in the streets
for lack of storage space.

National bankers of Oklahoma City

the bank g'laranty fund assessment.
Order Unfair, Charge.
It is the '.nntention of national bank

come effective tomorrow unless res
cinded by the board, is unfair and
will not accomplish the purpose f ir
which it is intended, that is to strength

will injure the smaller state banks.

come to Visitors, ;
The first day of the Ozark Traill
convention and the fust day of winter
arrived simultaneously. Winter started
off in true form, ignoiing the prepara
Hons which had been made for the ses
sions. The convention was forced to
take second place. Rain, which began
tailing early I uesday morning, contin
ued throughout the forenoon.
Cars Damaged.
Thousands of cars which necessarily
were parked out of doors Monday night
suffered considerably by the drenching
which they had to take. Many of them
were without tops, and cushions, left
there Monday night when the weather
promised to be so fair, were thoroughly
saturated.
If the weather was dismal, the con.
vention, however, was rather a reflec
lion of the rn:!iuiiam and ginger of the
previous afternoon, when the ureatest
parade in the history of the city was
pulled off in all proper style and pomp.
Auditorium Packed.
The Auditorium was packed in tho
opening session this morning. The
crowd numbered 4.IXX) persons. More
than J,UX) were unable to find seats,
and several of the route headquarters
stopped sending the delegates to the
Audiiorium an hour before the session
began.
1 his morning's session bore no hint
of the coming contest which will loom
up as the feature of the convention to
morrow, if advance "dope," runs true to
form. Tulsa and Amarillo delegations
contented themselves with placarding
the Auditorium with their arguments
in favor of the next convention's going
to their respective cities.
Many Bands Play.
All the noise ami enthusiasm, con
centrated for weeks before the conven
tion, rame forth when the delegations
from the contending trails got fully
warmed up. l or an hour before the ses.
sion began, one or the other of the six
bands which were seated in the hall,
was playing incessantly.
The delegations were seated in see.
lions. In the brief intervals when one
band would finish plaving and another
was getting ready to start, the delega.
tions would start their yells, which
ranged from chants to real hair-raising
whoops. Although they were greatly
outnumbered by some of the other dele
gations, the "Orark Trails Short Line"
crowd made the most noise.
. Jonesboro Fight Looms Up.
Significant was the appearance of
four delegates wearing Jonesboro,
Ark., badges The Springfield conven
tion voted the IUI7 session in the Ar
kans-as town, but as the session hero

it has the power to rescind the action
taken there A resolution to this effect
will he introduced tomorrow afternoon.
Jonesboro, with a number of adherent
trnrn Arkansas and Missouri, is ex
pected to make a bitter fight to retain
the ')7 meeting. The strength of
Jonesboro is not known.
Morning Session.
'Ibis morning's session was devoted
entirely to the usual preliminary
speeches of a convention M, I). Light,
font, of Springfield. Mo, was intro
dined bv t ol W. II Harvey as lbs
presiding of furr for the convention. Mr.

his intention of running the convention

After the invocation by the Rev. Fhl

"All laws of the city are suspended
during this convention except those
governing manslaughter and burglary,"
the mayor said.
Governor Talka.
Governor Williams, in a speech filled
to the final sentenre with practical
illustrations of the value of good roads,
welcomed the delegates to the state.
"I would like to see all these route

Williams. "This, of course, I not pos
