Minority Party Threatens to

And of Course, Cornwell Would j

ACiOCIATlD MB1?J
CHARLESTON, Nov. 21.?Efforts;
to enact into law the legislative program
outlined by Governor Hatfield j
in his message to the special session '
of the legislature Monday were con- j
tinued Tuesday when the house and J
senate assembled at 10 o'clock. The !
committee of eleven appointed in the j
senate to handle the business of the
session discussed methods of procedure
until a late hour Monday night
without reaching a conclusion and
finally adjourned until 9 o'clock
Tuesday morning when it was expected
the complete program would be
** V4 \#
Democratic leaders declared they
had found in one of the bills introduced
Monday a "joker," which,
while innocent enough on the surface,
really took from Governor-elect John
J. Cornwell the power to name any
officers or agents of the state government.
They said they would contest
the passage of this measure to the
last and if beaten in the special session
they would carry their opposition
into the regular session which
begins in January by refusing to support
appropriations for the salaries
of such officers as might retain their
positions under the proposed law.
While in many quarters, especially
in the hotel and state house lobbies,
there was talk of compromise on
Governor Hatfield's legislative program
as outlined to the special session
of the legislature Monday, Republican
and Democratic leaders said
that, the issue had been flatly put and
that everyone of the measurs introx
ducd Monday would be pressed to a
final vote.
The Republican members of a committee
of eleven annointed in the sen
ate Monday held another meeting
Monday morning to complete their
" plans, but the Democratic members
did not meet, the statement being
made that they were ready;
Both house and senate waited for
more than an hour for the report
from the committee to which the bills
had been referred. Two reports were
finally received, one a majority report
favoring the passage of the bills and
the minority objecting. The majority
report was adopted 51 to 28. An attempt
was made to have the reports
go over until Wednesday as printed
copies had not been furnished members
but it was voted down with one
purporting to give three days consideration
of the bills, while another resolution
substituting the minority report
for the majority and making It

at 10 o'clock was opposed by i

(By AV. A. Garnett.)
While the platform philanthropists
were whereasing and resolving in the
Masonic hall a little boy, not over
seven years old, -was shut up in the
county jail. He is a truant and
would not go to school. The boy's
mother Is dead and his father haB a
'housekeeper." The truant officer
3ays that the little fellow is "or'nary"
and as he wouldn't go to school he
bad to be jailed. If appearances go
for anything the boy is anything but
a desperado. He is a handsome 'little
fellow and when the truant officer
took him out of jail yesterday he told
the boy that if he didn't go to school
he would lock him up with the
bloodhounds. The child's home?if
he has any?ip at Norwood. He is
too young to be admitted to the
school for boys at Pruntytown and
the humane society will have none of
him. There was no place for him but
the jail.
just now tney are discussing child
welfare at Masonic hall and the "up- |

reading papers, theses and theories,

practically homeless, spends four

MANILA. Nov. 21.?The new Philippine
congress, convened under the
Philippine bill which was signed by
President Wilson on August 29, met
Tuesday and for the first time in the
history of government of the
islands a full-blooded Moro took his
seat In the upper house. The Moro
senator is Hadji . Butu, for many ;
years prime minister of the sultan
of Sulu, that unofficial functionary
of the American government who
wields an immense influence among 1
the Mohammedans of the Sulu
archipelago and the far East gener- 1
ally. , '
Two other full-blooded Mores took '
their seats in the lower house side 1
by side with two delegates from the 1
wild tribes?one an Igorrot and the
other an Ifugao. . The tribes these <
men represent stepped out of saw- 1
agery only Monday and their names l
are linked with some of the blood- 1
lest deeds In' Philippine history. i
Hadji- Butu, who becomes a mem- 1
ber of the senate by appointment of
Governor General Harrison^Ws looked
npon as one of the strongest men j
among the Moros and has always i
counselled conciliatory tactics on i
their part toward-the government. i

"Wonderfully Interesting and instructive
addresses on child labor, defectives,
hygiene, juvenile court
work, reformatory institutions and
nursing service were delivered at today's
sessions of the second annual
West Virginia Conference of Charities
and Correction in the Masonic auditorium.
People of Clarksburg who
have-not yet attended these sessions
are missing something worth while
and they should take advantage of
the unusual opportunity presented
and attend the remaining ones.
Tuesday morning's session was
opened with a report by Prof. L. M.

on the collection of laws in West Virginia
governing children. This was
ordered at last year's conference for
publication In pamphlet form. Prof.
Bristol has compiled the laws and
has the copy ready Tor the printer.

Interesting committee reports were
submitted on child labor by Alias Nolu
McKlnney. of Fairmont, and on defectives
by Dr. Irene Dullard*- of
Wheeling.
Mrs. Bertha G. Cndy. of Now York
City, educational field secretary of
the American Hygiene Association,
made an address on "Some Social
and Economic Developments in Twentieth
Century' Home Life."
"The twentieth century family,"
said A^s. Cady. "is developing in
rather a spectacular way. due to contributions
from medicine, sociology,
history, woman's entrance into the
economic world and her approaching
entrance into the political world. The
question now is what attitude we
shall take, whether we shall look
back into the family of tho past for
an Ideal, or look squarely into things
as tlioy are and diagnose the family
of today, find out what Is the matter
with it and whether it is measuring
up to standards of efficiency.
Vital Questions.
"We find certian fundamental conditions'
with which we have to deal.
These are the question of postj>oneraent
of marriage, the question of divorce,
the question of reform in marriage
rather than a reform of divorce
and the question of facing fundamental
difficulties in dealing with family
relations. These are embraced in
the liquor auestlon and in the question
of sex misunderstandings, which
have to do with maladjustments and
prostitution. We And that we must
face these evils and the best way of
doing bo is by educating our children
for better marriage, the establishment
of standards by which our
young people may select their mates,
which should be based on health,
mental and social development and
Ideals. These are the objectives of
the National Vigilance Society, the,
American Hygiene Association, and
3lmllar organizations. These ideals 1
:an only be realized by educating our
ihildren properly in sex.- hygiene and
thus abolishing the double sex standtrd."
