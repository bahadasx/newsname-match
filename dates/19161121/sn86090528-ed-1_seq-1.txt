No attempt has been made to repair

week. It is said that the frames, If
replaced, could in a few moments be
removed with but little difficulty and
another jail break follow if the pris

This is causing Dud Dryden, the
heavyweight jailer, to make frequent
and hitherto uncalled for trips to the
rear of the building during the day
and night to see that no attempt is
being made to escape.
