ATTRITION IS SOLE
AIM OF ALLIES IN
'FIGHT TO LAST MAN'
By J. W. T. Mason
(Famous Authority on the European War.)
The best used word in the war vocabu
lary now is "attrition."
It means the European conflict is passing
out of the stage of novel strategy, and tacti
cal genius, and entering the phase of final
blood-letting.
The allies are trying to put so many Teu
tons out of the fighting, that in the end, quite
irrespective of ground gained, the Germans
must abandon all hope of a victorious peace
in order to save what remains of the nation's
fighting manhood.
Financial pressure is playing its part to
ward bringing the war to a close, and so is
the British blockade of Germany. But, these
measures for the present are incidental. De
struction of man power, without cessation is
now the major purpose of the allies.
By sheer man-alaylng power, the
allies expect to bring Pruaalan mil
Itarlsro to Its knees
And nnqueationablv. the allies
