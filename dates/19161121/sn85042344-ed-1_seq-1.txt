To Address Meet.
Great significance Is attached to the
announcement today that the brother
hood heads will address the American
Federation of Labor i-onvcniton in
Kaltlinore tomorrow. Never before in
the history of the two ot gantziitions
have any of their members met In
joint session, but their meeting ut Bal
timore will be the result oi a care
fully worked out agreement that the
two' forces shall join hands In work
ing for the general betterment of the
organi.eil railway employes.
After receiving tho brotherhood
heads President Wilson saw Chair
man Adanisou, author of tho elglit-
hotir law.
After their 15-minule conference
with the nresldent. the brotherhood
heads would admit only that they bars
congratulated Mr. Wilson on his re
election. Warren S. Stone, head of tho
enuineers. declared that lie could nol
tell now whether a strike would be
called If the eight-hour law was not
put into effect January 1
"Wc can tell that better later."
Adamson Confers.
Itepresentative Adainson went over
plans for railroad legislation fullv with
the president. Atterward ne said ma.
he had no doubt that the eight-hour
law would be upheld by the courts as
constitutional, lidding that the mens
ure was very carefully framed by law
yers fullv familiar with the situation
and with the constitution.
"I huvo a bill picpared for mini
tlonal legislation to meet t'le sit nit
tic, ll which I probably will inlrocluCH
as soon us congress convenes," In
said.
He added that the believed Hie In
terstate commerco commission under
existing laws already had the power to
take wages Into consideration In fi
ing freight rates.
"Niilhlng to Strike Talk."
"I do not think there Is anything In
the talk that the railroad men will
call a strike !f the eight hour law Is
pending in the courts," said Mr. Ad
unison. "In doing so they would be
running dlrectlv contrary to public
opinion, and that no man or body ot
men run afford to do.
Mr. Adamson also declared it was
Ids personal opinion that the suits to
tist the constitutionality of the eight-
hour law were brought In a further
effort to secure advances In freight
rules und that If any definite assur
am es of Increased rates were given
the -ases would not be pressed.
TTiu brotherhoods heads appeared
well pleased with the situation to
night. They were particularly elated
over their talk with the president and
tho prospects of addressing members
of the federation In Baltimore tomor
row.
W. G. Lee, head of the trainmen,
said the conferences which b-d to an
alliance between the organlzattoni
were productive only of an agreement
to work for the general betterment of
conditions among all organized rail
road workers.
Tho conference at the " department
of Justico today followed Issuance of
orders from tho brotherhood heads
to their officers in every city where a
stilt has been filed to be of all possi
ble aj-slstance to the government at
torneys. While no details wero forth
coming nM.to what wus discussed to
day It wa-Tundorstood that the broth
erhood leaders explained many Intri
cate features of their present wage
scale system to Messrs, I'nderwood
and Todd. They were particularly
anxious that the attorneys understand
their mileage payment system which
is to lay such all important part In
the suits.

orgalil.'.atloli is hopelessly divided un
less some subsequent action is taken
to bring the discordant elements to

most immediately after State Chair
man (li-lssli-r called the meeting to
order, and the wildest confusion pre
vailed until a large number of tho
'iiiii-iitteei-icn got up almost in a
hotti and left the room.
The Kill break was caused over a
plan to summarily depose State Chair
man Gr-issler, altho it never progressed
to the point of being brought beforo
tin- li-cetlng.
Chilli man Arbitrary.
A half dozen members were on their
feet at the same time, endeavoring to
Ik- 1 1 -it ill. but tho chairman arbitrarily
refused to recognize anyone to dis
cuss tlie various motions, and with
light proxies made out to himself and
about 2r others in the hands of his
personal supporters, rammed thru
liis urogram.
After the majority of tho commit
teemen present in person or liy proxies
In the hands ot actual reside tits of the
counties from which they emanated
bad left the hall, Geissler and his sup
porters proceeded to elect F.. K.
Samins of Nowata as secretary of the
committee, but when it dawned upon
them that tliey had hopelessly divided
the Republican party and that an
o'her meeting of the state committee
was being called to undo their work
they appointed a committee ot five to
confer with tho Republicans who wore
dissatisfied with their action, but at a
late hour tonight nothing had been
accomplished.

the American nonstop cross-country
re-cord was won by Miss Ruth Iiw ai

prise ut tho difficulties with which
she had to contend in making tho

tor from the tanks which are placed
too low to feed automatically when
the supply ebbs past a certain point.
"The airplane used to inuke this
record-breaking flight," the statement
read, "was the sin ill loop. the-loop bi
plane with the propeller In tho rear
which she hud built especially for
herself on the old model last March
for the looping-the-loop exhibition
she gave In numbers dunnut tho past

The statement quoted Mss Law us
saying that as sh appiouched New
York, her gasoline supply was getting
so low that "even the feeding by dip
ping was getting less effective." She
said she was preparing to land In the
citv streets If necessary.
The distance by which Miss Law
bettered Curlstrom's American record
was given by the club is 13S miles;
tho distance covered today from
Binglamton to New York at 152 mile
pies about twenty miles added by zig
