BIG REAL TEST OF
THREE OFFENSIVES
No Let Up in Campaigns on
Somme, in Greece, and in
Roumania.
BIG GUNS MAY BE SURPRISE
Effect of Heavy Artillery Fire
on Frozen Trenches Is Un
solved" Problem.
Three offenalvea are now at tho
height of their pressure as tho Eu
ropean conflict enters Us (third win
ter. For the first time since the war
began the military situation suggests
a continuation of active fighting
through the zero months.
The Anglo-French offenslvo along
the Somme and the Ancre; tho allied
advance along the Greek frontier, and
the Teuton movements In Roumania
all contain possibilities of winter sur
prises. The principal unknown prob
lem that the winter may solve Is the
effect of Intcnso artillery fire when
concentrated upon the frozen
trenchos.
Winter the Real Teat.
Since the start of the conflict there
has been no effort to test tho ability
of either 'aide to withstand an In
exhaustible trench bombardment
under tho conditions of semi-numbness
which winter enforces upon the
combatants.
Hitherto, trench fighting has slack-1
ened largely Into a winter draw, with
the factories in the allied countries
turning out munitions for spring
operations. Now. the test has come
which will show whether winter, un
der conditions of extreme military oc
tlvlty. Is tho better trench ally for de
fensive or offensive operations.
The beginning of the cojd weather
sees tho allies better situated nlon
the western front because they have
established strong artillery positions
on hlirh ground for shell blasting
operations against the frozen lines.
Hitherto it has been, up-hill righting
for the Anglo-French armies. During
the winter they will havo more down
hllMyork jjflo,
Allies' Advantage In Greece,
. Along the Greek ' frontier tho ad
vantage also rests with the allies, be
cause their lines of overland com
munications are much shorter than
the German-Bulgarian llne,s. This
fact Is capable of very effective use
whon winter storms begin to Inter
fere with the smooth movement of
supplies to the front.
In Roumania the advantage is with
the Teutons because the Roumanians
ran obtain guns and ammunition only
from Russia, where the supply Is not
sufficient to equip properly the Rus
sian forces.
The war's third winter may be a
supremo tost, not only for tho fight
ing powo- of tho belligerents, but of
the staying power of their non-combatant
populations ns well.
This is the reason why Great Brit
ain, Franco, Russia, and Germany are
now putting into effect new systems
for conserving food supplies and In
dustrial power. The belligerents

CONCLUSIVE PEACE,
IS CANADA'S DEMAND
Dominion Premier Declares Noth
ing Else is Acceptable.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21 Only a peace
that Is conclusive in gaining the ends
of the allies will be acceptablo to Can
ada, the dominion premier, Sir Robert,

Canadian Club here.

said, "It wan due to the fact that her
sons stood In tTie way that Calais was
not opened,"

feeling of Canada toward ultimate
peace, the premier said:

hope that it will not be long deferred,
fio long. as we In Canada have a voice
there will be no trace, nor an Inconclu

NEW BORDER PATROL
PLAN TO BE URGED
Wilson Expects Conferees to Ac

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J Nov. 21.
A final plan for border patrol and
withdrawal of the American punitive
.force now In Mexico, backed by Presl
dent Wilson's approval, was to be
presented to tho Mexican members
of the American-Mexican commission
today, with the statement that, the
Administration at Washington expects
it to be accepted without further
wrangling. The plans are contingent
upon several concessions by General
Carranza, which have not yet been

adopted.

"Labor will watch from the side-
