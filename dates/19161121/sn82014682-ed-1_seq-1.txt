Trouble In the engine room almost
resulted In the Matson steamer iWil
helmina sticking her nose on the mud
bank in Rotten Row this afternoon as
she wa3 entering the harbor. But for
the presence of mind of Capt. Peter
Johnston the big liner might have
grounded in the mud.
AVhen moving up the channel about
noon,- passing the foot of Fort street
Johnson signaled the engine room for
more power. The main engines did
not respond to the telegraph and he
could not get speed enough to swing
her over in line with Pier 15, her
berth. ;.
Acting without a moment's hesita
tion, as soon as he realized the en
gines were not responding to the tele
graph, Capt Johnson dropped anchor
and whistled for; the Matson tug In
trepid. - The tug was on the scene in
a few minutes and helped to nose the
liner Into her berth. '
Because of the commander's" quick
action, the liner was brought to a stop
in plenty of water. On taking the
lead six fathoms were found , nil
around hen , Had she not been stopped
when she was, however, the liner
would : have been dangerously close

who is charged by federal . officials

The testimony anent the alleged

told of the formation here some seven

by Christian Chinese, to wipe out the
smoking of opium and to help those
already addicted get rid of the habit
This organization, the witness said,
sought to keep the young people from
the habit and induce the older ones to
take treatment
At first the witness said, the or

WASHINGTON, D. O, Nov. 21.
Official circles here are frankly
alarmed over th increasing danger of
trouble with Germany over, the sub
marine controversy which has never
been finally settled. The latest de
velopment in the sitnation came last
night with the formal announcement
that Germany has semiofficially ad
mitted that the steamer Arabia was -sunk
in the Mediterranean sea by. a
German submarine without warning.
This information has stirred official
Washington to ;ts depths, for it bids -fair
to throw oien once more the
whole of the diver dispute and bring
the two nationi to the verge of open,
rupture once mure. It Is known that
President Wilson Intends taking ' up .
the problem raised by the renewal of
the submarine attacks by the German,
divers, but so far. though there are
five cases pending, he has not taken,
any active step in the matter. :
- It is believed, here that there Is a
possibility that Germany will make the
Arabia, a test case. A -
