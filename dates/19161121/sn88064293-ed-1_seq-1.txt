MAURICE D. SHANNON SLATED
FOR POLITICAL APPOINTMENT
The Mayor's Acceptance Means That An Electinn Must
Be Held To Select a New Head of City Officials.
Hon. Maurice D. Shannon, mayor
of Morgan City has the considera
tion of Governor Pleasants for the
appointment of Secretary of the
Conservation Commission of Louis
iana. The acceptance of the appoint
ment by Mayor Shannon has not
been officially acknowledged by him
but the matter and its final disposi
tion is thought to rest entirely with
him. The Mayor returned Monday
from a conference with Gover
nor Pleasants at New Orleans and
will again meet with the Governor
in a few days. After their next con
ference Mayor Shannon will then
state positively his position in the
matter.
Mayor Shannon's political recog
nition comes from the valued ser
vice he has rendered his party in
parish and state during the past. He
is a prominent leader of the Demo
crats in St. Mary Parish and is, per
haps, largely responsible for the
strength the democrats have shown
in this parish. His leadership stands
out prominently in the view of the
fact that all other parishes in The
Third Congressional District have
been won over by other political par
ties. As a recognition of his service,
the leading Democrat of the state
now proposes to reward Mr.

UNIQUE OFFICE.

A
Adjoining the main -office of the
F. B. Williams Cypress Company in
Patterson, Louisiana, the Coons Cy
press Silo Company of that city is
erecting a unique office for their
business. Patterned after a silo, the
office will be circular in shape, hand-,
somely finished and appointed with j
modern office furniture on the in-'
terior, and on the exterior it will be]New
encircled with bands, and the sur- ]
facing finished with staves and
sections to represent a silo. The offi
ce will be 24 feet in diameter and
will supply ample floor space for its
needs. Unusually efficient lighting

The Coons Cypress Silo Company

Ithe new T company, is a gentleman of
j broad knowledge of the business of

Shannon with a political appoint
ment which is commensurate with
the deserts of the appointee. While
a conscientious secretary of the
Conservation Commission, such as
Mayor Shannon, would doubtless
always find a vast Volume of
important work to be accomplished
in the office, the secretaryship is a
paying one and the many friends
and followers of Mr. Shannon here
and over the state will be ready to
heartily congratulate him in his ap
pointment and to commend the Gov
ernor in his action.
The acceptance of the appointment
by Mayor Shannon will call for an
election in Morgan City to fill the
vacancy in the Mayor's chair as his
new duties would probably demand
that he remove his residence from
this city.
Other political appointments
which have been recently announc
ed are: J. L. Lyons, Houma, captain
of one of the boats of the conserva
tion fleet at Lake Charles; L. Bon
ner of Morgan City, as engineer on
the Opelousas.
quarters and factory location. Mr.
Coons has the entire United States
and Canada, perhaps foreign coun
tries, as a field for his business and
he is laying out a business-like cam
paign which undoubtedly will crown
his efforts with great success.
.The Coons Cypress Silos are a
Louisiana product that has already
come into wide recognition. Their
merit is recognized in their winning
of the highest awards at the recent
Farm and Live Stock exhibition at
be]New Orleans, the fair at Donald
