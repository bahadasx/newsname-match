Kauai Society Hear Several
Very Interesting Papers
The meeting of tho Kauai His
torical Society Thuisday evening,
Nov. lfi, was, by common consent,
the most interesting and successful
in the history of tho Society.
In tho absence of tho President,
the Vice-President., Rev. J.M. Lyd-J
gate, occupied tho chair.
h In the lino of business several new
members wore elected, and, on the
suggestion of Mr. Clias. A. Rice, a
committee was appointed to lake
stops to preserve, and, perhaps, rcs
, i tore, some of tho more important
Heiaus on tho island of Kauai, as.
these would soon be utterly forgot
ten, and, perhaps, demolished, if
not protected and preserved.
Tho first paper of the evening
was a Kauai chapter, out of a forth
coming "History of the Roman
Catholic Missions" in these Islands,
giving an interesting outline of tho
establishment of tho work, mainly
at Koloa and Moloaa, and reveal
ing a surprising degree of bitterness,
that verged on persecution, on the
part of the ollicials as well as the
common ITawaiians. .The author
was Rev. Father Reginald Yzen
doom, tho official historian of .the
Roman Catholic Church, as well as
a recognized authority on general
matters: The paper was read by Mr.
Avery.
Tho seond paper on the program
was one on the "Historic Spots of
Interest at Wailua Kai. "Prominent
among these was tins famous Holo-V'lj'olo-ku
birthstone, where all the
real chiefs of exalted' station of the
" olden time must be born. Two Or
three important Heiaus, and the
Papa-Alae, where Kauai tradition
localizes the discovery of lire, add
to tho interest of tho region archeo
logieally, while as tho auciont capi
tal, and tho residence of the kings

A Hilo paper of last week contain
ed the following interesting informa
tion concerning Dr. Kaumu Ilan
chett, a Hawaiian who was born in
Lihue and is a half brother of Dep
uty Sheriff W. O. Crowell, of Wai
mea :
One Hawaiian young man who
has distinguished himself on tho
mainland visited Hilo last Monday
and was tho guest for the day of tho
Rev. S. L. Desha. Ho is Dr. Kau
mu Hanchett, a graduate of Har
vard University Medical College and
a half brother of Deputy Sheriff
Crowell, of Wahnea, Kauai. When
he stepped ashore from tho Great
Northern in Hilo last Monday it
was tho first time in ten years that
he had set foot in his native land.
Dr. Hanchett is a graduate of the
Kamehaineha Schools, of Punahou
College and of Harvard. When he
graduated from the University ho
was one of fifty young physicians
who took the examination for the
position of an interne in one of tho
big Rhode Island hospitals. Di.
Hanchett stood at tho top of the
list and secured the position, where
he was for two years until Iks resign
ed to come home. For tho last four
months lie was assistant superinten
dent of the hospital.
Dr. Hanchett will open offices in
Honolulu and proposes to make his
bomb here. He says there is no
place like Hawaii'after all."
Eleele Church Work
Eleolo is to have a Sunday morn
ing biblo class in connection with
the new church organization. The
class will bo conducted by Mrs. C.
F. Loomis, and will take up the
study of the life of Christ, using
Rosworth's "Studies of the Life of
Christ" as tho basis of the work.
In response to a general request
on the part of tho Eleele church,
Rev. J. M. Lydgate will hereafter
conduct services there twice, instead
of once a month as heretofore.
These services will lie held on the
first and third Sunday evenings of
the month, and special effort will
be made to render them interact
ing and attractive, musically as
well as otherwise. With regular
stated services at Lihue, Koloa,
Kilauea and Eleolo, Mr. Lydgate is
kept busy on Sundays, though he
declares it is tho ear that does most
of tho work. He has worn out a
set of tires in three months.

COL SPALDING
WINS IN BIG SUIT
In the suit of James Stewart it

.70, a balance tho plaintiffs claimed
from tho Colonel on account of the
construction of a building in Port
land, Oregon, costing 8502,2(17.42,
tho supreme court has reversed the
decision of tho lower(Judgo Whit
ney's) court, which means that Colo
nel Spalding wins. ,
Tho case was tried lofore a jury
about a year ago and in pursuance of
tho verdict Judge Whitney rendered
his deoisWm, The supreme court
holds error of law, reverses the
judgment and vacates tho verdict.
Error was eommited in allowing
certain evidence to go to tho jury
and in certain instructions given to
the jury against the protest of coun
sel for the defendant.
The opinion o f tho court was
written by' Chief Justice Robertson
and wan concurred ih by the entire
bench.
Special care is being taken in tho
new school inspection work of the
Board, of Health in Honolulu to de
tect incipient tuberculosis among
tho children and the extra precau
tions, it is hoped,, will soon be "ap
plied to every island. This sysjem,
this year has been extended from
Honolulu proper to the island of
Oahu. On Kauai the tuberculosis
nurse attended all the sehool ex
aminations pointing out to the phy
sician the children from tuberculous
families and giving him other in
formation that would help him de
tect the disease.
This part of tho tuberculosis cam
paign is the outgrowth of work
started several years ago, when pre
liminary surveys showed that a
great deal of consumption could be
expected in Hawaiian schools. A
mong a number of suspects then
taken under supervision some have
improved to such "an extent that
they wore returned to school this
year, but in some other cases it wis
necessary to send the little patients
to sanitaiiuhis.
The anti-tuberculosis bureau is
working on the accepted theory of
the increased prospect of infection
in children over adults. Some bold
the theory that all consumption
starts in the child and only develops
in later years. The buieau does not
ignore this possibility and takes all
precautions.
It has issued this week a special
warning to parents and teachers to
observe more carefully tho children
under their charge and to remem
ber that a suspicious symptom in a
child is more suspicious than in an
adult. Jt urges every one to take
no chances and have delicate chil
dren frequently examined for the
disease.
Mr. Dean III
. I). Win. Dean, clerk of tho Fifth
Circuit Court, has been attacked by
a fever and fears wore entertained at
first that it might be typhoid. Pros
out symptons do not indicate it,
however, and the patient is much
improved today.
Five cases of illness in tho past
few weeks in the region mauka of
the road from Lihue to Koloa have
been diagnosed as typhoid fever.
Senator Cbas. A. Hico will be a
passenger in the steamer tonight
for Honolulu.
INSPECT IS IN
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
8A0 IN ESCAPES,
STILL AT LARGE
A Filipino convict going under
the name of Felipo lhano escaped
from tho Lihue jail last Thursday
morning and has since been at large.
The police all over tho island have
been notified and are on the look
out for tho missing man.
Felipo, or Felipe, is one of the
men convicted in the Circuit Court
only last week of assaulting and bru
tally beating up Luna Louis Con
radt, on Kealia plantation. He and
a man named Suarez were sentenced
to not less than two year and elev
en months nor more than live-years
in jail. The worst offender of the
three (a man called Jose) was giv
en not less than three nor more
than five years.
The man Felipo simply disappear
ed from tho jail, and no one seems
to know how or when. Some police
accounts have it that ho made his
get-away at 7 o'clock in tho morn
ing, but he was not definitely miss
ed, perhaps, until around 1 1 o'clock.
NEW DENTIST IS
F
Dr, F. M. Rranoh, dentist.of Ho
nolulu, who has recently been on
the island of Hawaii, will arrive
hero Friday morning to consult with
those most interested on the subject
of establishing permanent dental
iccommodations at some place on
tho island.
It is now certain that Dr. Derby
will not remain hore-in fact it is
doubtful that hi- will return at all,
for it is known that he has other
plans.)
Tho dental proposition has be
come a little complicated for tho
further reason that Dr.. Rraley, who,
when he left Kauai, stated that ho
could not return here, has since
found that his business arrange
ments will permit him to do so; and
he is now quite willing to como
back to Lihue and resume his prac
tice. Tho feeling around Lihue seems
to bo that there is room in Kauai
population of 30,000 people for two
dentists, and that with Dr. Rraley
at Lihue and Dr. Rraneh at Wai-
mea both will be able to build up
bank accounts and the public will
bo better served and bettor satisfied.
Drs. Rraley and Rraneh are excel
lent dentisls and in the opinion of
many people tho island would be
fortunate in .getting both of them.
