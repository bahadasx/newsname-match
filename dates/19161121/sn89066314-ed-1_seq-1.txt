for Co-operation as An
After-War Remedy.

Only With Minimum Un
rest, Is the Keynote.
By ROBERT J. BENDER
(United Tress Stuff Correspondent
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21. A call to
American business to meet the un
precedented conditions after the war
will be the kejnotc of President Wil
son's message to Congress, Tuesday,
December 5. Wilson is completing the
message today.
The President believes that the
countrj's industry can do a maximum
amount of work only when there Is a
minimum amount of industrial unrest.
He will emphasize this In his appeal
to the employe and cmploj er for more
co-operation. I
President Wilson has formulated
plans for rendering practically impos
sible strikes of all kinds. He will
urge a completion of a program sim
ilar to that proposed In his last mes
sage to handle such situations as the
threatened strike, growing out of the
demands of the railroad workers.
Wilson will also urge Congress to
give careful consideration to possible
legislation which will aid transporta
tion sj stems to lmproe to meet the
additional stress under which they
will be placed at the close of the war.
CALLS NEW SCHOOL AFTER POET

Field" Over "Sallie Flood."
Eugene Field School this was the
name adopted unanimously by the

Sa'.lie Flood, who as a teacher in the
Columbia schools is remembered by
many Columbians for her earnest de
votion to her work among the ch'l

school were sent to the board. Among
them were Sallie Flood, Eugene Field,

Detectives Say McDaniel
Children Were Drugged
Defendant Is Unmoved.
By United Press
ST. JOSEPH, Mo, Nov. 21 That
the three McDaniel children were
drugged was the charge today in the
murder trial of Oscar McDaniel, held
for killing his wife July 15. Detec
tives testified today that McDaniel re
fused to give aid in clearing up the
murder mystery, thus adding to the
circumstantial evidence against the
defendant.
The state admitted that there was
considerable weakness in the chain
of circumstantial evidence. It admitt
ed that the testimony of Mrs. Luke H.
Moss and Miss Aillene Moss, mother
and sister of the murdered woman,
was"based almost entirely on hearsay
and therefore would probably not be
allowed in the records of the court.
When the night-gown worn by the
murdered woman on the night of the
crime, a dainty, filmy bit of lace, cov
ered with blood spots, was exhibited
before a crowded court room today,
McDaniel was unmoved, showing no
signs that he felt any interest in what
was going on. He smoked a black
cigar as he gave his attorney's ad
vice. A piece of bone as part of the skull
of Mrs. McDaniel was introduced as
evidence by the state during the ex
amination of Sam Townsend, a Burns
detective attached to the Kansas City
bureau. At the time of the murder
Townsend was In St. Joseph. He told
of examining the room of Mrs. Mc
Daniel and of picking up the piece of
skull from the flopr.
WILSON BANQUET IS GIVEN UP
Celebrat'on Abandoned Because of
Small Sale of Tickets. '
There will be no celebration of the
Wilson victory tonigtft. The banquet
committee of the Boone County Demo
crats, which had charge of the ar
rangements for the dinner tonight,
met yesterday afternoon and because
of the slow sale of tickets and the ap
parent lack of interest decided to give
up the banquet. No other plans for
a celebration have been made.
"The sale of banquet tickets was not
large enough to warrant giving the
dinner," J. E. Boggs, a member of the
committee, "said this morning," so the
committee found It necessary to aban
don Its plans. There was also some
discussion as to what kind of ce'lebra
tion should "be held. While many were
in favor of the banquet, there were
those who Insisted that we have a ral
ly." WILL NOT AWARD CLASS TITLE
C. L. Brewer Calls Off Football Game

was first scheduled to be played while
the Varsity football team was playing
the Aggies at Manhattan. It was post
poned because a number of the sen
iors were on the VaVsity squad.
The game was supposed to have
been played yesterday afternoon, but
the two teams disagreed on the Ume
for playing and the eligibility of some
of the players. C. L. Brewer settled
the controversy by calling off the

AT FOOTBALL SCHOOL
Coach Dobie's Eleven Hasn't
Met Defeat In Last
Nine Seasons.
When a president of a great univer
sity is far away from home and Is
urged to boast about his school, what
does he say? Perhaps he enumer
ates the academic advantages, the
scholarship records or the high stan
dard of the faculty members, but It
he happens to be the executive of an
Institution such as the University of
Washington at Seattle, as is Henry
Suzzallo, who was in Columbia today,
he can mention that the school's foot
ball team hasn't met defeat In nine
jears. The standing of his university
Is established without delay.
President Suzzallo was not in Co
lumbia to study Missouri football
methods. Coach Dobie needs no as
sistance. J)octor Suzzallo nnd his wife ar
rived at 1:45 o'clock today from the
East where they attended a confer
ence of university executives, 'and
where Doctor Suzzallo met President
A. Ross Hill who Is an old friend. The
visit to Columbia was for a confer
ence with Dean Walter Williams re
lative to policies to be followed in a
school of journalism. Two vacancies
have occured recently in the faculty
of the Washington department and
President Suzzallo is trying to fill
them. There are 226 students in jour
nalism at Washington.
"If I'm supposed to boast about the
University of Washington, I'll begin
by saving that the University of Mis
souri obtained one of our most high
ly valued men when E. J. McCaustland
left our school to become deanof the
School of Engineering here." "
The University of Washington is
the second largest institution in en
rollment west of the Mississippi River,
according to President Suzzallo,' the
largest being the University of Minne
sota. The student body at Seattle
numbered 4,600 last year. The cam
pus of the university is one of the
most beautiful in the United States,
the President savs. it is situated be
tween two lakes, on h'Hs overlooking
Seattle, and is covered with giant for
est trees.
"Our school of forestry is, I believe,
the best and most practical In the
country. The work is especially bene
ficial because qf the forestry industry
in the state. We also have a fine law
school, and a good graduate depart
ment." President and Mrs. Suzzallo left at
4:30 o'clock for Seattle.
DEUTSCHLAND DEPARTS AGAIN
Undersea Freighter Will Pass Scene
of Accident Before Bark.
By United Press
NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 21.
The Gerinan undersea freighter,
Deutschland made her second depart
ure for her home port of Bremen at
2:35 o'clock this afternoon. Escorted
by two tugs, which were to accompany
her to the three-mile limit, she passed
out of the harbor to the accompani
ment of cheers of many spectators,
shortly after 2:30. Once out into the
main stream, she slowly swung about,
pointed her nose toward the sea, and
steamed away.
With the tug Alert alongside the big
merchant submarine, she was soon
nearing the open sea.
There was no secrecy incident to
the departure today.
At 2:40 the Deutschland passed Fort
Crumball and was headed for 'the
south. The submersible will pass the
Race Rocks, where she collided with
a tug, about 4:30 o'clock this after
noon, judging by the speed she was
making. She will be able to clear the
Race well before dark and will then
have the benefit of the night for a fast
dash beyond the three-mile limit
The Deutschland passed out into
the sound shortly after 3 o'clock.

RETURHSFORAVISIT
AFTER LONG ABSENCE
James E. Cox, 71 Years Old,
Is Still Healthy and Ac
tive and Likes to Hunt.
NOT HERE SINCE 1875
Notes Great Change in Co
lumbia and Is as Proud as
of His Home Town.
A happy old man, past the 70 -year
mark, one who has partaken of the
best In life and given the' best In re
turn, who was once bouyant, but is
now old such is James E. Cox, who
returned to Columbia Saturday night
to v lsit his sister, Mrs. F. M. Johnson.
. "r. Cox left Boone County forty-one
years ago. With the exception of four
years spent as registrar of deeds at
Jacksonville, 111., he has spent the en
tire time In the West. To use his ex
pression, he just "dropped in for a
shor.t visit to the scenes of his child
hood." Mr. Cox is actively engaged in busi
ness, being a paper-hanger and deco
rator a Wymore, Neb. He is yet ac
tive, regardless of his seventy-one
years. Hunting and fishing are sports
of which he is fond. He characterized
himself as an "old man having a good
time." J f
Father la te gash for GulJ.
His father, Thomas H. Cox, went
West in 1850, after the first rush for
gold and died in the following year.
Mr. Cox still has in his possession
letters written by his father to his
mother here, telling of his trip across
the plains. The party with which he
was traveling was attacked by Indians
several times. On one occasion the
travelers were compelled to surrender
their entire stock of provisions to
avoid massacre. Mr. Cox and his sis
ter read and re-read these letters, and
they both treasure them highly.
"Returning to Columbia is just 'like
a-srf-oure;"- said-Mr:"'CoxrrtTWas';
surprised to find so many of my old
friends still living, friends who have
the warm-hearted sympathy that only
old folks know. I expect to stay here
until I have had my visit out; then I
shall return to Nebraska.
"Columbia's growth and improve
ment are marvelous. The town I left
forty-one jears ago had no indication
of ever becoming the Columbia of to
day. I have found many boyhood
friends, and we have brought to life
many tales of the "old days.' The Uni
versity is one of the greatest Institu
tions in the West."
He's Prond of Columbia.
Mr. Cox is proud of Columbia even
as he is of his "home town," Wymore.
He asked for a list of all the educa
tional institutions here, to show to his
paper at Wymore.
"Though fond of the out-of-doors,
the more strenuous work of pioneer
ing and fighting Indians has not been
my vocation. I attribute my good'
health to the amount of time I spend
hunting and fishing. I would rather
do that than anything I know of."
While here Mr. Cox shouldered a gun
and spent some time in the woods
shooting quail and rabbits.
The visitor was born on a farm
three miles cast of Columbia. He was
only 4 years old when his father went
West in search of gold, never to re
turn alive. He and his sister are the
only living members of the family.
Their father was a native of Ken
tucky; Mrs. Johnson was born there.
Frank Johnson of the Palmer-Johnson
Hardware Company and William
Johnson are nephews of Mr. Cox.
Mrs. E. M. Thompson Buried.
The funeral of Mrs. E. M. Thompson,
who died Sunday, was held at the
home of her sister, Mrs. J. T. Jamison,
1113 Ash street yesterday afternoon.
The services were conducted by the
Rev. T. W. Young, pastor of the First
Baptist Church. Burial was in the Co
lumbia Cemetery.

Adamson Dispute Causes Un
certainty About Walkout
Expected January 1.
Ily United Tress
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2L A general
railroad strike January 1 may not fol
low as the result of the present situa
tion growing out of the Adamson Law
dispute. This interpretation was
placed this afternoon on rumors of
statements made by Chief Stone of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers that the question of a strike
"will be answered later,"
The element of doubt regarding the
remarks of Stone grew out of the fact
that-last week inTftw-Yorlr$he chiefs
said there would be a strike if they did
not get a real eight-hour day. Now It
is believed that the brotherhoods will
be contented to await a test of the
constitutionality of the Adamson Act.
The brotherhoods are shrouding
their movements in deeper secrecy
than that which marked their pro
gram last summer. Today the leaders
of brotherhoods are in Baltimore to
speak before the convenUon of the
American Federation of Labor, a move
that portends co-operation between
them to force an eight-hour day in all
branches of railroad service. At the
same time the Department of Justice
and the legal department of the broth
erhobds are ready for the opening of
the test Thursday, when the Union Pa
cific and the Santa Fe will start their
suits in Kansas City.
