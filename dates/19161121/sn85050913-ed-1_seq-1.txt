A call to all Americans! No lit
tic nation in the world's history has
teen more previously stricken than
Belgium, yet no people can raise
||p their heads more proudly from the
f^- dust. The crown of thorns is still a
-v crown! No money contribution can
4 pv'i atone for the loss of Lou vain and a

A
Belgian cities lately ra
I r|ydiant with the splendor and glory oi
centuries no money can compensate
gptfor the loss of life, the homes ruin-
Mled, the families scattered, the chil
p||dren dying. But there is one great
task which money can ac-
fi|complisli and with your aid will ac
jfepeomplIsh—the adequate feeding: of
fe^the children of Belgium. The need
is appalling—indisputed and lndis
Mj-putabler. Under existing arrange-
Jpi|ments
one-third of a soldier's ration
'Ml—Just enough to keep body and soul
fltetogether—is now served daily to all
^necessitous persons in Belgium.
{Roughly there are about five million
of them. The children's plight is
A'-worst of all and it is to secure them
fone square meal a day—served at
§*Wtlie school—that the Dollar Christ
•$}nas Fund is now working in cooper
^4«tion with the Commission for Re
.Ulef in Belgium which this year, as
^n the, two previous years, has con
«sented
1
to administer our receipts
^with special attention to the human-
vltarian
object we have in view.
Mr. W. L. H.onnold, Director of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium,
who has made a complete inspection
and study in Belgium of conditions
of the country declares frankly, that
Jthe chU4c«ii «f Belgium cannot grow
to healthy maturity unless they are
provided with more food than is
Viow supplied to them Mr. Percy S.
Bullen, the Secretary of the Dollar
Christmas Fund, who has lately re
turned to New York after interview
ing members of the Belgian Govern
ment at Le Havre, France, makes a
precisely similar report. The Bel
gian people, scourged, bruised, brok
en and dripping with blood, with
possibly still greater heights
of sacrifice and martyrdom yet to at
tain, are powerless, for the third
year in succession they turn with
tear-dimmed eyes to America and I
do not believe they will turn in vain.
For the third year also I have con
sented as treasurer of the Dollar
Christmas Fund to make a direct
and personal appeal.
The immensity of the task of war
relief may discourage us sometimes,
but we know from past experience
that by concentrating our efforts
upon ono definite feature great and
beneficent results have ensued. In
1914 ouV fund sent a Christmas ship
to Belgium laden with food and
clothing last year we sent 40,000
pairs of children's shoes this year
the greatest task of all awaits us—
to help the commission provide tho
school children with one square
meal a day.
It is not a pleasant duty for three
yearB in succession to appeal to one's
friends, neighbor* and fellow coun
trymen for money, no matter how
good the object may be, but this
cause, we feel, is one which should
find a very warm response in the
barts of all Americans doubly bless
in their isolation and detachment
the vortex of horrors and
odsh/ed and agony of the battle
is in Kin rope. Even if you liavu
'^to every other fund we be?
the name of humanity to as
the Christmas Fund for'Desti
clgians. Help to send a Christ
ift worthy of America.
Dollar Christmas Fund is in
te sympathy with every other
in behalf of Belgian destitute
[ffers from other appeals only
sense that the total sum re
will be forwarded,, as a spec
Tristmas contribution from the
of this country to the desti
eople of Belgium, an exprea
sympathy with sorrow from
ople to another and a tangi
oof that Christmas goodwill
these days of strife and
ed has not disappeared frotn
I ask you therefore with
earnestness and great confl
to share with us the privilege
lng the children and you Wiay
assured that not alone the Bel­
gian nation of today Jut generations
yet unborn will hold you in affec
tionate and grateful remembrance.

Some of Them air Having Trouble
in Getting Jobs.—Is Causing
Some Apprehension.
Des Moines, Nov. 20.—The Cham
ber of Commerce and other civic or
ganizations are face to face with
another "war problem."
R. H. Faxon, general secretary, of
the Chamber, discovered this today
when two requests were made of him
for employment by men who had
served honorable terms in the Des
Moines organizations at Brownsville
and whose terms of service had ex
pired, with the result that they are
back home but without employment.
When the men were mustered in
to service two problems were laid
upon the community, according to
the conception of the commercial or
ganizations. The Chamber of Com
merce and the Greater Des Moines
committee promptly accepted the
most urgent—that of caring for the
relatives of those left without means
of livelihood when the national
guard was called out. Several hun
dred dollars have been paid out from
the fund raised by the Chamber and
other organizations.
Now comes the employment prob
lem. Many men left good positions
when the call to arms came. Some
companies will take their men back,
but other concerns have filled the
places.
"I am afraid that this is going to
prove a harder problem to solve
than that of providing for destitute
families of guardsmen," said Mr.
Faxon today. "There' is one man
who was in the insurance business
when the call to arms came. He is
a comparatively young man, clean
and capable. He is, at the head of
one of our patriotic organizations.
He has served honorably for three
years in the national guard and is
now home from Brownsville. His
business, however, has been disor
ganized during his absence and ho
has applied to us for assistance.
There are many similar cases."
Chicago and other cities are tak
ing up the problem through their
commercial organizations and from
all appearances Des Moines will di
the same thing.
For Sale.

LOOKS MIGHTY SMALL
Little Son of Mr? and' Mrs. W. S.
Weston is Victim of Painful
Accident.
Master Charles Weston, little son
of Mr. and Mrs. W. S. Weston, was
the victim of $ very painful acci
dent about 4 o'ScJock Saturday after
ig8^! —He aii%.ttrother little1 bOy
were crossing Willson avenue at the
Louis Frank clothing store corner
and Charles, seeing a heavy wagon
loaded with coal coming down the
street, waited for it to pass. The
other little fellow evidently thought
to pass in front of the team and
wagon and gave Charles a push,
causing him to step directly in front
of them. One wagon wheel passed
over Charles' left foot. The unfor
tunate lad, screaming and crying,
was taken into the Frank store and
later to Dr. Richardson's office
where an X-ray picture was made
of the injury. There were no brok
en bones but the foot was badly
crushed. The lad Is very lucky to
escape permanent injury. The boy
is resting comfortably at present.
Eldora Wins.
The football game between El
dora and this city at Riverside park
Friday afternoon resulted in a
score of 21 to 0 in favor of the vis
itors. The teams were pretty even
ly matched, with slight odds in fav
or of Eldora. The visitors did not
score until after the first two quar
ters had been played. The attend
ance was not large, most of those
present being local school students.
About a half dozen Eldora residents,
aside from the visiting team, were
present.

REMEMBER THE
SOLDIER BOYS
Boys at Brownsville Will not .Have
Home Cooking for Thanks­
giving Dinner.
In ten days Thanksgiving Day
will be here—and also on the bor
der in Brownsville. The boys of
Company will have a good dinner
4nI no,doubt about that but it -wllf
not be just the same as home cook
ing. Wouldn't it be a good stunt for
everyone to send the soldier boys a
box of homemade, candy or home
made cookies?
The box may be made as large as
the giver can make and send, and it
would make the boys feel as if
someone in Webster City was taking
a personal interest in them and
their welfare.
The Freeman-Tribune would like
to make a suggestion that every
woman who sent a comfort kit to a
soldier boy last July, make a box of
homemade candy or cookies and send
to the same soldier for Thanksgiv
ing day. The box should be mailed
here not later than next Saturday,
Nov. 25th, if it would be sure to
reach the boys by Thanksgiving day.
To make a pound of candy or to take
a couple dozen cookies from the fam
ily baking is not a very big thing to
do, but it is guaranteed to please a
soldier away down there in Texas.
We were especially requested not
to send the boys anything too rich
for their digestion, as was done dur
ing the Spanish-American war, but
a pound of homemade candy never
killed anyone and would certainly
cheer. Anyone who has ever been
far from home or friends and has
received a box of something good to
eat, marked with his own name and
plainly and unmistakably intended
for him, will understand that the
cheer is not given in the pound of
candy alone, but in the spirit which
went with it.
There is plenty of time to make
the candy and get it mailed, either
by parcel post or by express, and the
address should be as follows:
John Brown, Company C, Second
Iowa Infantry, Brownsville, Texas.

Several Ribs Broken and Side Se­
verely Bruised—Suffering
Much From Injury.
C. E. McConnell, a farmer living
about seven miles northeast of this
city, was severely injured Friday
forenoon while feeding cattle in the
barnyard. He had driven up to the
fence with a rack of fodder and had
stepped with one foot on the top
board of the fence when his foot
slipped and he fell across the top of
the fence. Several ribs were broken
and his side severely bruised. Today
is the first he has been able to move
himself at all.
He is suffering greatly with the
injury which will require a long and
tedious convalescence to heal.

BOYS BURGLARIZE
THE C. F. MUM
HARDMURE STORE
Break Into Store and Take Knives,
v.
Flashlights, Etc., Also'
$14.50.
About a half dozen lads from fif
teen years downwards in age, broke
into the rea{• end of the C. F. Gard
ner hardware store Sunday night and
stole eight or ten pocket knives, four
or five flashlights, two razors and a
glass cutter and took from the cash
register $14.50. in cash. They then
made their escape and the two eld
est ones went to Fort Dodge for a
big time, returning on the late train
to this city.
The thievery was not discovered
until next morning upon opening up
the store and Mrs. Elmer Carlson,
who lives in the flat above the store,
was able to give some light upon the
subject. She had heard noises about
the rear of the hardware store Sun
day afternoon about 4 o'clock and
going to tho rear door of her hall
had seen and recognized three boys
who all ran and hid upon her ap
proach. Later she went down stairs
and asked them what thoy were do
ing about the store and ordered them
away. The robbery must have been,
done soon after dark for the older
lads left on the 7 o'clock westbound
train for Fort Dodge.
The boys got into the store by re
moving a board in the glass door,
which had been placed tn lieu of a
broken pane, and reaching inside,
unbolted the door and thus gained
an entrance.
The officers took them yesterday
morning into custody and it has not
yet been determined what will be
done. This is one of the -gravest
acts committed by boys in this com
munity^antfr Witt-stritte a chill to the
hearts of parents. Such acts by
young boys are only the embryo of
hardened acts by criminals and prop
er and fitting punishment will be
given the offenders in this case, who
must only have reached this stags
through a series of minor depreda
tions. In consideration of the ex
treme youth of the lads, their names
are withheld from publication.
Beroth-Knapp.
Miss May Beroth and Mr. James
Knapp, both of this city, were unit
ed in marriage at the Christian
parsonage at 3:30 Friday after
noon by Rev. C. V. Pence. The
bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Thorn-,
as Beroth, and the groom's mother
and sister witnessed the ceremony.
The happy couple will make their
home with the bride's parents on a
farm a mile and a half from town,
Mr. and Mrs. Beroth having recently
moved to tho farm from their east
side home.
Steam Roller Broken.
The big steam roller used on the
asphalt paving now being laid has
been broken and the paving force
will be off duty until another roller
can be shipped to this city. This Is
quite inconvenient, as the paving
job will only take about four days
longer.
