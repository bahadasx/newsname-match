Prospects Are For One of the
Best Gatherings Ever
Held in Northern
Indiana.
CLEAN AMUSEMENV
AIM OF DIRECTORS
Strong Yrders Issued to Book
Only Best of Attractions.
Hope to See Track
Marks Bested.
Stake races, purses, premiums and
prizes aggregating $25,000 for the
Sept. 12-16 fair this next fall have
been announced by the directors of
tho St. Joseph County Fair &. Amuse
ment association. The valuo of the
awards went up by leaps and bounds
Friday night until tho huge total
was piled up, insuring better race
meets, better agricultural, manufac
turing and art exhibits than were
held last year.
It has been announced that the
awards are the largest ever offered
by any fair or exhibition where there
was no gambling on the grounds, no
intoxicating liquors sold, and where
no objectionable side shows are per
mitted. The total list of awards, the
committee announces, will make the
fall fair excel In many degrees both
the races and exhibits of last year.
910,004 for llncc.
Of this $25,000 secured, $10,000
will ro for the race meets, which
with a larger string of faster horses
present Insures track events, which
will nearly equal the grand circuit
races. The track proper, it is ex
pected, will be in much better shape
this season. Additional bonus prizes
for horses which lower the present
track records will be hung up.
The keynote of the fair will be Its
attractive exhibit and race features
minus any objectionable side attrac
tions. Already plana are under .way
for the advertising campaign to bo
conducted all through the county.
i which will reiterate the fact that
the fair will be absolutely free from
anything that savors of risque or
that has the smallest tint of the
vulgar.
"The place for mothers, sisters,
wife and the children, where they
can gain an education from the large
exhibits of agricultural live stock,
manufacturing, art and many other
exhibits." is the way the posters will
read. "The highest class of amuse
ments and the most refined," is an
other slogan of the fall exhibits,
Faor Clean Fair.
"Attention has been called by
those In charge of the side shows
and exhibits, of the toast given at
the horseman's banquet at the Oliver
Friday night last year during fair
week. The short address was made
by a grizzled old horseman, for
many years a follower of the turf
who has seen fairs good, bad and in
different. On this occasion he said:
"Never In my experience with the
racing game have I seen a fair so
clean as the one here at South Rend.
Looking back at similar race meets
and exhibits, and in the light , of
some of the unfortunate attractions
that 1 have seen there. 1 thoroughly
believe that the fair here has been
the cleanest from every point of
view that I have ever seen.
"I like the atmosphere that you
people have preserved here. It be
speaks well for the community, and
for the continuance of successful!
I race meets and exhibits such as you '
I are just completing."
The severest restrictions will be!
j imposed lipon any side shows or at
tractions out or the ma-in line this
year, it has been announced. Strict
tab on all amusements to see that
they carefully come up to the "policy
of clean shows." i to le kept. This
policy will he made a vital factor In
the advertising campaign and will
be a feature of the fair itself.

the center of interest In the contro

transferred to the house today th
supporters of tho president wer
gravely concerned over the peasiblo
effect of the entire xaatter on th
Furopean belligerents. It was felt
that the bitterness of the debate In

have a very detrimental effect 4n all

the freedom of speech customary' lu
