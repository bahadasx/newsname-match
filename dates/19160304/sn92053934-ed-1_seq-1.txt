coming had anything to do with the
delay on voting on the armed ship is
sue in the house and the decision of
the leaders there to postpone action
until Tuesday at least.
Administration officials said today
that practically all senators who voted
yesterday to table the Gore resolution
were voting for the president's policy
and that should the house fail to vote
to uphold the president in decisive
form the fight might be carried back
to the senate for a direct vote to de
feat the Gore resolution warning
Americans off ships of belligerent na
tions. They expressed confidence that
complete victory would follow such a
course.
Rumor Is Attacked,

situation like the one which now con
fronts America, dishonors itself.'"

THE WAR
TODAY
The driving German assault on
Terdnn has baited for the second
liflie in the Itouaumont sector
northeast of Verdnn, this time In
the face of formidable counter at
tacks by the French in an effort
to take Douaumont village.
Berlin announces that the
French attack on the village and
the German lines adjoining it was
"repulsed partly In close range
lighting."
The clash of the opposing arm
ies at this point has been of a
desperate character. The French
lost more than a thousand prison,
ers.
After the desperate battling on
the Douaomont plateau in the re.
newal of the German drive for
Verdnn, there has come a second
halt. Paris today announced that
there had been a cessation of in
fantry attacks by the crown
prince's troops, although his artil
lery is still keeping np a heavy
bombardment.
The continuation of artillery ac
tivity may indicate a speedy re
newal of the important front
northeast of the fortress where the
French lines form a salient. The
Donaumont sector Is pointed ont by
French military critics as a key
position essential to the German
purpose of taking the fortress.
Hence the desperate nature of the
struggle which has been going on
for its possession.
The Importance of the German
activities in other sectors is not
overlooked, however. There have
been advances on both the French
Hanks and indications are furnish
ed of contemplated thrusts at vital
points in the lines about the curv
ing front, such as on the north
west line, where the dominating
heights of LeMort Homme has
been under fire of German heavy
guns for some days.
The German admiralty an
nounced the sinking by German
submarines of two French auxil
iary cruisers and a British patrol
boat. "
It Is unofficially declared in
Paris that the German claim to the
sinking of two auxiliary cruisers,
"off Havre," Is unfounded.

In March to Bagdad.
Petrograd, March 4 (via London,
4:10 p. m.) For the second time in a
trifle over a fortnight the Russians
have broken through the Turkish
front. The taking of Bitlis, officially
announced last night, is, in the opin
ion of Russian military authorities,
two-fold, as it increases the surety of
the Russian left flank in the Caucasus
operations and also further opens the
way to Bagdad, the goal of this south
ern movement, and to a junction with
the British forces near that point.
Bitlis also served the Turks as a
point of communication between the
troops operating in the Mush district
and those about Lake Urumlah, over
the border in Persia. With the com
mand of the whole Lake Van territory
in their hands, the Russians now ef
fectually separate these forces.

forStateAid
Springfield, 111., March 4. After a
conference today with Adjutant Gen
eral Frank Dickson and a member ot
the staff of the attorney general, Gov
ernor Dunne decided he had no au
thority to send troops to Nokomis, 111.,
in Montgomery county, as requested
in a petition of citizens who said the
town lacked a much needed police
force.
In the petition it was stated that life
and property in Nokomis were con
stantly in jeopardy. Crime has been
on the increase for some time, accord
ing to the petition, and shootings are
common.
Major Joe Weinsteln and the major
ity of the board of aldermen of No
komis have not been on harmonious
terms, it is alleged. The aldermen
have refused repeatedly to confirm
the appointment of chief of police,
night police and special police for the
last 18 months. There have been a
number of shooting scraps, one mur
der, and many violations of the local
option law. The constable and lone
deputy sheriff at Nokomis are said to
be powerless to enforce the law.

Dunne today was said to have been
circulated by G. W. Collins and C. F.
Dude.

SEA COLLISION IS
TOLD IN WIRELESS
Coast Stations Pick Up Messages of
Brazilian Ship After It Bammed
Another VesseL
New York, March 4. The Sergipe, a
Brazilian steamship which left this
port yesterday afternon for South
American ports collided with another
vessel early today about sixty miles
south of New York. An hour after she
sent out an S. O. S. call, the wireless
operator on the Sergipe sent word that
neither vessel was badly damaged and
that his ship was safe and continuing
her voyage.
Conditions for wireless transmis
sion were bad this morning and the
shore station could not decipher the
name of the ship with which the Ser
gipe collided. The shock temporarily
disabled the Brazilian steamship's
wireless apparatus. The first vessel
to answer the Sergipe's call for help
was a British auxiliary cruiser be
lieved to be the Caronia. The Sergipe
asked the cruiser to "stand by" but
later signalled "all well." It was re
ported that the Caronia was the ship
which struck the Sergipe but wireless
messages picked up by nearby stations
did not confirm this.
The Sergipe is a steel vessel 2S0 feet
long gross tonnage 1S59.
BRITISH JUBILANT
ATSENATEACTION
Support of President Wilson Creates
Great Amount of Comment in
English Papers.
London, March 4 Few things short
of an actual military victory could
have given the British press greater
satisfaction than President Wilson's
victory in the senate. The Manchester
Guardian remarks editorially that
Germany, having failed to convince
the United States, apparently will ig
nore sentiment in that country. It
continues:
"Germany has now defiantly as
sumed the line that she is within her
rights and means to abide by the con
sequences. If American citizens lose
their lives she will make no apology
or promise of amendment"
The Guardian says it cannot imag
ine that Americans will accept "such
a reversion to absolute barbarism"
and therefore regards the decision of
the senate as having the greatest sig
nificance. All the London afternoon papers
comment on the size of the vote to
table the Gore resolution. The Pall
Mall Gazette says President Wilson's
difficulties have not been appreciated
fully here and that It will be possible
to Judge the magnitude of his victory
in the light of these difficulties.
From the moment the president
based his appeal on the question of na
tional honor, the Westminster Gazette
remarks, it was certain the nation
would rally to him.

Berlin, March 4, (by wireless to:
Sayville, N. Y.) Tho sinking of two
French auxiliary cruisers and one
British patrol boat by German aubma-.

The announcement also says that'
from Taris is reported the sinking of
the transport Provence "which carried
1,800 men, of whom only 696 were
rescued."
La Provence was listed as an auxil
iary cruiser but the wording of the
Berlin dispatch does not make it
clear whether she was one of the two
said to have been destroyed. Official
reports from Paris indicated that
about 3,130 men went down with her.
The French admiralty said no sign,
of a submarine was observed before
or after the sinking.

a mine.
Six of the 22 men of the crew lost
their lives.
Paris, March 4. It was announced
at the French ministry of marine that
there were nearly 4,000 men on board
the French auxiliary cruiser Provence
when it was sunk in the Mediterranean
on Feb. 26.
As the ministry of marine on Feb. 29
announced that the number of surviv
ors of the Provence disaster was esti
mated at 870, it is indicated that up
wards of 3,130 HveB were lost
It was stated that on board the Pro
vence were the staff of the third colon
ial infantry regiment the Third bat
talion, the Second company of the First
battalion, the Second machine gun com.
pany, and one extra company.
Is Greatest Disaster.
The loss of life on the Provence is
the greatest ocean disaster of modern
times. Up to the present the largest
number ot lives ever lost in one wreck
was when the White Star liner Titanic
struck an iceberg off the New Found
land banks on April 14, 1912, and sank
with a death loss of 1,595. The rescued
numbered 743.
The French ministry of marine had
previously issued no statement as to
the number of persons on the Provence
when it went down. The vessel, how.
ever, when in the transatlantic service
could carry 1,960 persons, including tite
crew, and it has been presumed that,
as it was transporting troops between
ports not far apart, it was carrying a
number of men larger than her normal
capacity.
