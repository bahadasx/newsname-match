MAYOR WTTiTJAM HALE THOMPSON AFTER FTS LONG- AND TER
RIFIC FIGHT UNHORSED TWO OUT OF THE NINE "REBEL"
ALDERMEN WHOM HE SAYS HE "DESPISES WITH ALL HIS
HEART AND SOUL."
IT SEEMS THAT' HIS HONOR THE MAYOR WAS TRIMMED MORE
CLOSELY OR KEENLY THAN HE SUCCEEDED IN TRIMMING HIS
BITTER ALDERMANIC OPPONENTS.
DENIED RIGHT TO ADOPT HIS
MULATTO DAUGHTER.
IT IS HIGH TIME THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THIS CITY AND
THE CITY FATHERS REFRAIN FROM THEIR BABY OR HORSE
PLAY, STOP THEIR FIGHTING, LOUD CUSSING, GET DOWN TO
SOLID BUSINESS AND DO SOMETHING SOME WAY OR OTHER IN
THE WAY OF CONSTRUCTIVE MEASURES WHICH WILL REDOUND
TO THE LASTING BENEFIT OF ALL THE CITIZENS OF CHICAGO.
ALDERMEN JOHN J. COUGTTT.TN, JOHN RICHERT, THOMAS J. DOYLE,
JOSEPH HIGGINS SMITH, S. S. WOLKOWIAK, JAMES B. BOWLER,
JOHN H. BAULER, WILLIAM R. O'TOOLE, HENRY P. BERGEN,
JOHN TOMAN, HUGH NORRIS, WILLIS O. NANCE, JOHN N. KIM
BALL, WILLIAM J. HEALEY", JOHN KJELLANDER, FRANK J.-UNK,
JAMES RAE ANDJBRNEST. M. CROSS WERE RE-NOMtNATKOTOj
MAKE THE RACE AT'THE'ELECTION-TUESDAY, APRIL 4, IN THEIR!
RESPECTIVE WARDS.
HARRY HTLDRETH, JR., WON THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR
ALDERMAN OF THE SECOND WARD AND WILL WAGE A HARD
FIGHT TO BE ELECTED FROM NOW UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSE.
LEO J. DOYLE, DEMOCRAT, AND JOHN A. SWANSON, REPUBLICAN,
WERE NOMINATED FOR JUDGE OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT.
Now that the smoke of the battle
which was one of the shortest and the
hottest ever waged in an Aldermanic
contest, has cleared away, and the dead
and the wounded have been properly
eared for, it is very easy to discern
that the wing of the Democratic party
which belongs to the Hon. Eoger C.
Sullivan, and the main end of the
Republican party which is under the
eoutrol of the Hon. Charles S. Deneen,
won out or triumphed at the primaries
which have just come to a close, that
Mr. Sullivan and -his followers will
elect 25 to 30 of the new ward com
mittee men out of the 35, at the
primary, Tuesday, April 11, which will
be the means of causing the county
committee to fall under their control
for the next two years. Mr. Sullivan
will also decide who shall be and who
shall not be selected delegates to the
Democratic National convention, which
will bo held at St. Louis, Mo., June 14.
The Hon. Charles S. Deneen and his
faithful followers will stand at the
head of his end of the Republican
party, and like Mr. Sullivan he will
point out the gentlemen who will be
hosen delegates to the Republican
National convention, capturing the
majority of the ward committeemen
j:iing him control of the Republican
county committee for the next two
e;rs. At the same primary election
on Tuesday the Deneen and Sullivan
candidates for Judge of the Municipal
court Leo J. Doyle, Democrat, and
John A. Swanson, Republican, were
nominated over and abovo all the other
candidates who were in the race, show
"K tho smooth handiwork of Messrs.
Sullivan and Deneen.
Mayor William Hale Thompson, after
waging a long and bitter fight, suc
ceeded in unhorsing and mussing up
two out of the nine "rebel aldermen"
whom he says he hates with all his
heart and soul.
The great majority of the wise
politicians around the city hall all con
tend that His Honor the Mayor came
out of the scrap more completely
trimmed than he succeeded in trimming
the aldermen who have been bitterly
opposed to him in the past.
It does seem to us after all that has
been said and done that neither side
has much to their credit to brag about;
that it is high time that Mayor Thomp
son and the so-called wise city fathers
refrain from their baby or horse play,
stop their fighting and loud cussing and
settle right down to solid business, and
honestly endeavor to do something
some way or other which will be of
lasting benefit to all the people residing
in this great city.
Alderman John J. Coughlin, John A.
Richert, Thomas J. Doyle, Joseph Hig
gins Smith, S. S. Walkowiak, John H.
Bauler, William R. O 'Toole, Henry P.
Bergen, John Toman, Hugh Norris,
Willis O. Nance, John N. Kimball,
William J. Healy, John Kjellander,
Frank J. Link, James Rae, Ernest M.
Cross and M. J. Dempsey were re
nominated in their respective wards.
Robert M. Patterson put Alderman N.
A. Stern to sleep in Third Ward, and
Alderman Frank H. Ray fell on the
outside of the breastworks in the 13th
Ward. Those were the only two sitting
aldermen who were winged by Mayor
William Hale Thompson and his faith
ful city hall crowd.
Harry Hildreth, Jr., easily won the
Democratic nomination for alderman
of tho Second Ward, and he will wage
a strong and very hard fight to be
elected to the city council, and as he
is very popular his hosts of warm
friends freely predict that he will make
it mighty hot for Alderman Hugh
Norris.
Evansville, Ind., Feb. (Special)
Clifford Yarborough, 48 years old, a
white man, said to be a wealthy grain
broker living at Pulaski, Tenn., ap
peared with his attorney, W. C. Vawter,
before Judge Duncan C. Givens on
Tuesday and asked the privilege of
adopting Eugenia Murraj", a mulatto
girl, 17 years of age, saying the child
is "his daughter.
A petition signed by the mother of
the girl giving her consent was filed.
Yarborough was placed on the wit
ness stand and talked freely. He said
he wanted to right a wrong done many
years ago and give her his name, to
which she is entitled.
"I have plenty of money and can
ake"gopd . care of her,i he ,told he
Court. '!' brought $8,000 with me to
Evansville."
Judge Givens said he could never con
sent to granting the petition. He said
it would be the same thing as sanction
ing the marrying of whites and blacks,
and this he could not do.
Yarborough left the courtroom seem
ingly very much disappointed.

Miss Alice Callis. Tho bride and

credit to the store but an honor to the
race. Disagreement with the late
management, he states, is his reason.

NEGRO SEGREGATION BILLS
CARRY AT ST. LOUIS POLLS
St. Louis, Mo., March. Unofficial re
turns early show both the proposed
segregation ordinances have carried by
a majority of 34,344, the vote being
52,220 for segregation and 17,876
against.
Homer G. Phillips and George L.
Vaughn, leaders among the Negroes in
fighting the segregation ordinances,
have conceded that the ordinances have
been approved by the voters. The elec
tion was free from serious trouble at
the polls.
The two propositions voted upon were
similar in character. One of the ordi
nances provides that a Negro may not
become a resident in a block occupied
entirely by those of opposite color. The
other imposes the same restrictions in
blocks containing 75 per cent white or
the like percentage of Negro residents.

treat on last Sunday afternoon in lis
tening to Prof. Philip Seman, Superin
