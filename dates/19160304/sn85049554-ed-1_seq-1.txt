March 4.—The sinking of two French

The announcement also says that
from Paris Is reported the sinking of
the transport Provence, "which carried
1,600 men, of whom only 6U€ were res
cued."

whether she was ono of the two suid
to have been destroyed. Official re
ports' from Paris indlcatod that about
3,i'30 men went down with her. The
French admiralty said no sign of a

Paris. (March 4.—-It was announced
at the French ministry of Marine on
Friday that there were learly 4,000
men on board the French auxiliary
cruiser Provence when she was sunk
in the Mediterranean on Feb. 26.
As the ministry of marine on Feb.
t| arapunced that the number avr
Prpvence disaster was
.J^tUntftsd

were lost.'
It was stated that on board the Pro
ven ce were' the staff of the third col

The loss-of more than 3.000 lives in
cruiser Provence is the greatest ocean
flfsaster of modern times. Up to the
present the largest number of lives
»ver loat -in one Wreck was when the
White Star liner Titanic struck an ice
berg off-the .New Foundland banks on
April 1*. 1312, and sank with a death
loss of 1,535. The rescued numbered
743.
The French ministry of marine had
previously--issued no statejnen't as to
the number of persons on the Prov
ence when she went down. The vessel,
however, when in the trans-Atlantic
service, could carry 1.960 passengers,
including the crew, and it is presumed
that ,as she was transporting troops
between ports not far apart, she was
carrying a number of men larger than
her normal capacity.
Official Statement.
The official statement .announcing
the sinking of the Provence said:
"The French auxiliary cruiser Prov
ence II (so designated to distinguish
her from the French battleship Prov
ence) engaged In transporting troops
