The loss of more thnn 3,ftO lives In the

when In the Trana-Atlantlo service could
carry 1.960 persons, including the crew,
and It has been presumed that, as it
was transporting troops between ports
not far apart. It was carrying a number
of men larger than Its normal capacity.

WASHINGTON, March 3. Sen
ator Norrls of Nebraska, In the
course of the debate over the Gore
resolution, which was tabeled, ac-
cused the senators who had spoken j
during the day of explaining their
votes in an effort to satisfy their
constituents after voting to satisfy
the president who nithey termed the
head of the "pie counter."
If a few more confessions are
made here the president will have a
real expression of the sentiment of i
the senate" he said. "If you count
the confessions you-will find the
senators believe in warning citizens
from armed ships; if you count their
votes you will find they support tho
president. . ,
There were free expressions of
opinion- thathtinat'e setion: was
in effect a VScotch verdict "and

the president. f . r; ' '
WASHINOTON, March J.-Senator
Borah in the debate In the senate this
afternoon upheld the right of Americans
to go on armed merchantmen. He said
the senate, "the highest legislative body
In the world." had been "Germanised"'
aa "if directed by the Kaiser from the
throne."
In reintroducing his resolution Senator
Mi'Cuniber protested that debate could
not be shut off and that either later to
day or tomorrow he would call up his
resolution. ;
Senator Clarke, democrat, of Arkansaa,
also protested against the senate's action,
although he voted with the majority.
"There is no overlooking the fact." he
said, "that all the declarations of this
government have led In a certain direc
tion; that official America at least was

dent reaches a point In any negoti
ations with foreign governments, at
which he believes he had exhausted
his power In the premises he will in
the usual way report all facts and
circumstances to congress for its
consideration
WASHINGTON, March 3 By a
vote of sixty eight to fourteen the
senate today carried out President
Wilson's wish and killed Senator
Gore's resolution to warn Americans
off armed belligerent ships.
In a turbulent scene such as Is
seldom witnessed In the senate, vot-
ing proceeded with senators shout
ing objections, futlly demanding
recognition to explain tbelr positions
I an(i making hot retorts to each other
1 m 0( which were out of order. At
one time so many aenatora were,
shouting for the vice president's rec-gnftton-'thaf
tie "aergeant-at-arma
was called to restore Quiet.
Arter having maneuvered for two
days to get the resolution in such
I parliamentary position that it waa
disposed of without debate, the sen
ate then proceeded to a general dis
cussion of the subjects, which contin
ued all afternoon to the dtemay of
administration supporters.
A 'oefc -Verdict."
There were tree expressions of opin
ion that the senates' action, becauea. the
vote actually waa taken on a motion to
table the Gore resolution with correction
by the author and a substitute by Sena
tor McCumber, was In effect a "Scotch
verdict" and had not actually accom
nilshed the purpose of the president.
8uch statements aroused tthe president's
friends, who feared these would pro
duce an effect exactly opposite to that
Intended as a notice to the world that
the senate stands behind the president
in his demand on Germany for tha
ria-hta of Americans traveling me aeaa.
In the house, however, the foreign sa
faris' committee by a vote of 17 to t,
took a longer step toward metlns; fully
the president's wishes. It voted to re
port the McLemore warning resolution
with the recommendation that It, be
tabled. In the report the committee as
serts that the constitution Imposed the
conduct of dlplomatlo negotiations on the
president and "with this practice the
committee does not fel it proper for the
house of representatlvea to Interfere."
Administration Confident.
It probably will be voted on In the
house toinonow under a special rule. Ad
ministration forces are confident of a
full-fledged victory.
At the White House satisfaction was
expressed with the senate's action.
Senator (lore voted for the motion to
table and declared he considered the ad
ministration's victory a mixed one.
The debate, which followed the senate
vote, waa sensational. (Senator Lewls.
the democratlo whip, pleading with sen
ators for moderation In their remarks,
declared the Spanish war would have
been averted by action In congress simi
lar to that taken today and that the war
waa brought on by vituperative debates.
Senator Clarke, democrat of Arkansas,
who voted with the administration forces,
declared their action did not represent
the real aentfment of tbe senate. Senator
Fall, a republican, said:
"By your action today you have sent
to the kaiser, if you have done any
thing, notice that the senate of the I'rilted
States will look upon the sinking of armed
merchant ships and the death of an
American cltlsen, probably with some de
gree of regret but that no action would
be taken against him."
Itorah Arralaaa Senate.
Sensor liorah, republican, arraigned the
senate for what he characterised aa Its
exasive action. He said he would "rather
have battleships sunk than to have the
honor 'of this senate compromised before
the world."
On the other hand. Senator Kern, the
majority leader, upheld the action, asaert
Ing that It would proclaim to all natl in
that the president In exercising his con
stitutional powers Injthe conduct of nego
tiations spoke "not for himself, not for
his party, but for all the people of hi
country, who are prepared to back him
with tin Ir lives In an lnwtslence on Amer
ican rights.".

yesterdsy mysterious lights had been

keep helr movements secret. He felt
sure that the lights did not belong to

make no secret of their movement
Nebraska Delegation
FaVors Resolution

WASHINGTON. March S.-Spclal Tel
egram.) If a vote Is taken In the house
tomorrow, as now seems likely, on the
resolution warning Americans off of mer
chant ships carrying runs, even for de-
I fenslve purposes, the Nebraska delegation
will vote solidly In its favor, waa the re
sult of two conferences held by the dele
gation today.
Notwithstanding the overwhelming vote
In the senate on the (lore resolution, the
house Is stilt playing politics and It would
not be surprising if some pretty hard
language was used before the vote Is
taken.
Many democrats are sore because they
say the president haa endeavored to put
them In a hole and they resent his Inter

vote of 68 to 14, a greater majority
than they expected, administration

the . European belligerents and
thereby finally quelled In the aenate
an agitation which hasr embarrassed
President Wilson In the submarine :
negotiation! with Germany . .
Senator Gore'a resolution, A sub
stitute by Senator McCumber, a re
publican, and an attempt by Senator
Gbre to strengthen hla original pro
posal all were defeated at one time
on a roll call on a motion by Senator
James, one of the administration
whips, to table them. The admlnls-'
tratlon victory in the senate trans- '
ferred the fight to the house.
It was said at tha White Houae that the
result In the senate was satisfactory and
met the wishes of President Wilson, It .
was added that attention would now T
concentrated on tha situation In tha
house.
Two Democrats AaraJast It.
Senator Oore, htmaerf, voted to table
his resolution. Senators Chamberlain '
and O'Oorman were tha only democrats .
who voted against the administration.
Tli other twelve antl-admlnlatretlon
votes were republican. Forty-evn dem
ocrats and twenty-one republicans voted
to table tha resolution.
During the roll call Senator Smoot, re
publican, asked to be excused from vot
long because he was not able to vote di
rect on tha proposition. Senator Borah,
republican, objected, but ' the saaata
voted to excuse him.

Senator Borah, notwithstanding that
Mr. Fton waa explaining tha vote ot a

"If this senate Is going to be ragged,
the senator from Missouri will t gagg4

shouted.
"When order was restored fenator

I vote aye."
There was some uncertainty ami g
senators as to the status or the various '
resolution when the roll call bad be
gun. It was explained then that Senator
James, had moved to lay not only tha
Oore warning resolution, but also the so
called corrected resolution on the table.
It was necessary, then, for senators to
express themselves as to warnings aad
on the question ot killing of an American
on an unarmed merchantman as a causa
tor war In one vote. I

For that reason Senator Gore voted to
