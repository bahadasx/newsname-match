"The German dead lie in heaps

piled so high as to interfere with out
fire. We shot them down as they
jumped over their comrades' bodies.
We are now resting but ore always
ready to begin again to show the Germans

by a score of 22 to 18 in what, the
girls said, was the most sensational
game ever played In the Washington

eI ones being a goal shot by ' Sarah
