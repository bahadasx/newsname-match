Unpopular Rider Is Denounced in Fee

of Union's Possibilities.
The fight on the Borland rider took an'
unexpected turn last night when oficers
of the American Federation of Labor or
ganized more than 300 government em
ployes Into the Federal Civil Service
Employers' Union of Washington. at a
mass meeting in National Rifles' Armory.
The obligation of allegiance to the
American Federation of Labor was ad
ministered by Thomas F. Flaherty, of
the National Federation of Postoffice
herks.
it. M. McLarin. of the War Depart
ment, was elected temporary president
f the new union with J. H. Kesecker,
of the Interior Department, temporary
secretary, and Paul D. May, of the War
Department, temporary treasurer. Presi
lent MLairin announced that the next
meeting will be held at Typographical
Temple on Friday night, when perma
nent officers will be elected and commit
tees appointed to enroll the thousands
of unorganized Federal employes in the
District.
The action of the American Federation
came as a complete surprise even to the
government clerks themselves. The mass
meeting was called by the Central Labor
-nion of this city, presumably for the
purpose of protesting against the Bor
land amendment to make all government
clerks in the District work not less than
eight hours a day.
Geapere Makes Appeal.
Samuel Gompers. president of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor, made a spirited
tPpeal to the I5o government employes
w ho filled thet hal, to take advantage of
"this psycholesl moment which Mr.
Borland has given yfou" to organize to
pro ent a recurrence of such propositions
as the Borland rider.
Mr. Gompers' appeal caused an outburst
,f applause that lasted for several min
!tes. and when. a few moments later.
Frank Morrison. secretary of the Amer
itan Federation of Labor, urged all who
were in favor of organizing a government
employes' union to raise their hands,
more than ha'f those present responded.
Gratiied with the result. Mr. Morrison
announcedi that he would organize them
aftrr the protest meeting.
In making his appeal for organization,
Mr. Gompers said:
"I haven t anv doubt but that the Bor
land amendment will find respectable in
terment in the House. It deserves it.
From my viewpoint, now that we know its
life is limited and we will hear little of it.
I think we all, and you in particular, owe
Mr. Borland a debt of gratitude. It is
e ident he has done something no one
eke has been able to accomplish.
I am quite confident that it wasn't the
intention of Mr. Borland to arouse the
latent courage of the government em
ployes in Washington. And, so, I firmly
believe that Mr. Borland'& proposition has
resulted In bringilig the Civil Service em
ployes to realize that too long have they
been unmindful of their own welfare, and
it has made them determine to be on the
firing line in future to see that no wrongs
are imposed upon them.

seial to The Washinston Herald.
New York. March 3.-The intervention
of President John P. White, of the
United Mine Workers, wasn all that pre
vented the breaking up of the conference
of a subcommittee of bituminous coal
miners and operations at the Hotel Mc.
Alpin today.
This action, it was Intimated. would
have resulted 1if a general strike.
Both sides rejected propositions advanc
ed by the- other. The miners demanded a
a.1 cents per ton advance in Western
Pennsylvania and a S-cent advance In
IndIana, llinois and Ohio. The operator.
made a counter proposition for a 4.3
ensadvae in Western Pennsylvania
and 2 cents for the other States.
There was every Indication that the

Paris, March 3.-The startling
announcement was made by the
French Ministry of marine to
night that more than &oe lives
were lost, with the sinking of
the French auxiliary cruiser La
Provence in the Meditaranean
on February A
The admiralty announced of
ficially that nearly 4,ooo persons
were aboard the ship and that
she was transporting troops to
Saloniki. Only 796 persons have
been reported saved.
The greatest previous loss of
life on a single marine disaster
was that recorded in the sink
ing of the Titanic when 1,595
were drowned. On the Lusi
tania 1,206 were lost; on the
General Slocum nearly iooo
died.
The sinking of La Bourgoyne
cost 58o lives and that of the
Eipress of Ireland more than
1,000.
In the light of this record the
sinking of La Provence easily
takes eminence as the greatest
marine disaster in modern his
tory.

ChristianIa. March 3.-The tremendous
onslaught at Verdun is rightly construed
throughout Scandinavia as Germany's
final desperate effort to score a victory
over the entente powers and hasten the
issue of the campaign before the dejea
tlon now rapidly spreading among the
peoples of the central powers paralyses
their waning strength.
The hardships endured by the Austrian
and German peoples ere known to be
greater than has been offcially admitted.
Their staying powers are strained to the
sapping point, and a gleam of new hope
is imperatively needed to brace them for
further endurance.
Moreover. ae.eive Gesman success
would, it is believer, produce a far
[reaching p cal effect on certain neu
trals.
The Swedih people, while resolved to
make every sacrifice for their national
defense, entertain no desire to exchange
neutrality which is safe and lucrative for
belligerency which can bring no lasting
advantage and may spell ruin.
But nowadays the sentiments of a ma
jority of inarticulate citizena are of no
avail against the motives to which ruling
statesmen are impressible, and, person
ally, I feel certain that a decisive Teuton
victory at the present conjuncture would
be followed by far resonant changes In
the international situation.
On the other hand, Germany's failure
to break through the allies' lines and
open the road to Paris wil dispel the illu
sions harbored by those politicians who
are itching to obtain for their respective
countries participation In the historic
struggle and a share in the spoils of war.
and will be followed by renewed peace
proposals which, while still unacceptable,
would be far better than any yet emanat
ing from Berlin.

"With my family and 150 villagers I
saw the opening of the battle of Verdun
on February 21.
The Germans hurled against our lines
a fearful cyclone of fire, sweeping the
French rear with a curtain of drum fire
through which nothing could pass.
"With field glasses I watched the first
German attack on Ornes. Three times in
a single day the Germans charged in
dense formation, each time moving up to
the very musles of the French 7-s and
machine guns.
"Those gray-clad masses were wiped
out completely by the devastating fire.
"In the ravine winding around the
farm lands northwest of Vaux the
ground was covered with German corpses
for miles. The charging soldiers stamped
upon the bodies of the fallen. Language
cannot picture the scene of carnage."
