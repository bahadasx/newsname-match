MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards. Feb. 29. loifi
Opening prospects, pointed to lower
piices on cattle todav. but rnnrlitmns
did not bear out the forecast, and
sales were called strong, market be
coming active, receipts 8000 heart
toales of beef steers ranged - mnerlr
from $7.75 to 88.75, highest average
range since first of the vear. Several
strings of good Westerns arrived from
northern Colorado, the best selling
at S8.J to 88.50. some nlainer inrl
rougher cattle from that district this
week at $8 to $8.35. Cows and heifers
are selling strong, choice heavy cows
at $6.65 to $7 or a little better, fair to
good cows So. 5 to $0.50, most of the
heifers $7 to $8, tops $3.50. Stocker
and feeder trade' maintained its phe
nomenal strength, stock steers selling
mis week at 7. . to $7.90, .and feed
ers $7.30 to $7.90, exceptions above
this range, and some common stock
steers around $6.25. Breeding stock
is also in exceptional demand, stock
cows at $5.75 and upwards, good stock
heifers up to $7.50, and choice ones at
$8 or more. The impression prevails
nere that there Is a bare spot ahead
in the supply of . killing cattle, and
some further advances are on the pro
gram. The high prices for stock
grades are draw ing in cattle that were
taken out previously this winter at
lower figures, owners fiirurinir that "a.
bird in the hand is worth two in the
brush." This will probaly keep a fair
number of stock cattle coming unless
prices break. , - .
Hogs sold largely 15 higher, receipts
15000 head. Top was 8.68,- higher
than any hogs sold since February
1914, bulk of sales $8.30 to $8. GO.
Buyers took everything as fast it ar
rived this morning, order buyers sett.
ing a hot pace for the packers. The
feature this w eek is the large number
ot hogs bought on orders for Eastern
killers, that trade getting 4200 head
yesterday, as compared with 6000 to
loal packers, which Is a very large
percentage for the shipping trade.
At that, many orders from Eastern
killers went unfilled. Quality of hogs
here is very good, and weights average
200 lbs, showing a- tendency to eet
heavier each week.
Sheep and lambs sold steady todav.
several lots of lambs atrSlLOa, the top,
including some weighing 80 to 84 lbs.
