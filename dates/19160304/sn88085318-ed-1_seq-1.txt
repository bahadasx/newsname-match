OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
NOTES OF MINING
Boy A. Young, president of the
Electric Point mine, was here
Tuesday. .Mr. Young states that
his company has had ten miners
working all winter, and that they
have nearly 4,000 tons of ore on
the damps awaiting shipment soon
as the road is completed from the
mine three and one-half miles
down to the county road sys
tem. This road was surveyed
last fall, and work will begin on
construction about March 20, and
will require about a month to
complete it. Shipments will be
made not later than May 1.
George Stockwell is opening up
a six inch streak of tungsten ore
near Bissell. While the output
is small, he has the assurance that
the vein will widen with depth.
At present they are less than 20
t'ect from the surface. It is ap
parent that this is a continuation
of the Tungsten lode in the Deer
Trail camp.
The Laurier mine, at Laurter, is
working 15 men and has shipped
10 50-ton cars of ore this winter,
sonic of which was treated at
Greenwood and the balance at
Grand Forks. B, ('. It is a cop
per-silver proposition, a blanket
vein with a paystreak of '.) feet
that yields $70 per ton
Ore and fuel have commenced
to arrive at the Northport .smelter
and the plant; will begin opera
tions as goon as some necessary
equipment belated by bad rail
way conditions, arrives. The
starting of the Northport smelter
will be an epochal event in Ste
vens county history.
The settlement of the Copper
King difficulties which have been
in court during the past year, and
the consolidation of the contend
ing interests has been effected to
the satisfaction of all concerned,
so it is said. As a result the King
Mining Co. has been organized to
hold all the properties involved,
which includes the Copper King
mine and over 400 acres of min
eral land, much of which is
patented, in the Chewelah mining
district. All litigation, it is said,
has been terminated.
So long as our competitors own
the ships they make the rates,
they control the service and they
determine the routes. With this
power it is easy to favor their
own commerce and discriminate
against ours. —Mining and En
gineering World.
"But little consideration is
given to sources of consumption
of various metals," says Mining
and Engineering World. "It will
he of interest to learn that the
moving picture industry consumes
an amount of silver equal to the
year's production of the state of
Nevada —approximately 15,000,
--000 ounces. There are ahout
20,000 picture houses in the United
States, using approximately 120,
--000,000 feet of film regularly.
The average life of a film is three
weeks. It is estimated that 15,
--000,000 ounces of silver per year
are used for sensitizing."
The rise in the market price of
platinum from $20 to $120 per
ounce has created considerable
interest in this metal which is
found associated with placer gold
in many places. Placer miners
for gold along the Columbia river
will familiarize themselves with
a knowledge of platinum which
is believed to abound here.
The Wells Fargo mine, which
was discovered more than 30
yean ago by Sergeant Wells, a
discharged soldier from Fort Spo
kane who homesteaded and died
On Ciimas prairie near Springdale
Mime years ago, is promising a
season of activity in development
this year which will render it one
of the liveliest mining camps in
the Inland Empire. Twenty-five
years ago this property fell into
the hands of local mining men
who have kepi up the assessment
work with some slight additional
dtvelopmeni each year since that
time. While the on' was high
grade antimony, the price which
seldom reached above N cents per
pound would uoi yield enough
profits to overcome the heavy pen
alties imposed by the smelters,
th,e owners felt loathe to release
their title lest a time would come
when it would yield substantial
protits. The mine, which is in
the Huckleberry range, 12 miles
west of Gray station, contains a
uli-t'ciiit ledge between walls of
delomite and slate. Iron carbon
ates abound and a 400-foot tuunel
which cut the ledge exposed four
feet ul' ore which runs as high as
(>o per cent antimony. With easy
basting it is estimated that ten
cars of the ore can Ik; extracted
which will net the owners in the
close neighborhood of $10,000 per
cap. with values in gold sufficient
to pay I'm- the mining. Several
years ago the Wells Fargo Mining
Company was organized to hold
the title, and as the property is
situated on state laud a 30-year
lease nf the ground was obtained
five Mars ago. K. M, Hodgson i.s
president and general manager of
the company and his associates,
Jacob Keller. A. B, Bidgood and
J. W. Gillingham of Springdale,
have concluded to personally
finance the enterprise and start
■work April I. 'Phi' stimulus
which has brought this property
into high favor is the rise of the
price of antimony from seven
cents to 53 cents pcl 1 pound with
in the last few months with a
chance for a long period of de
mand for the metal. Arrange
ments are now under way for the
construction of buildings and
purchase of equipment for the
work and shipping will begin not
later than May 1.

TALKS ON BANKING.
(By courtesy of the American Bank
ers Association, Savings Dank Dept.)
Lending the Bank's Money.
ll' the bank confined itself to re
ceiving money offered for deposit
and paying it out again on checks,
it would render a very great and
necessary service to the individual
and the community, but it would
soon cease to exist, because the
life blood of all business (profits)
would be lacking. The operation
of a bank is expensive, and to
hire clerks, pay rent, buy station
ery and build vaults, merely to
protoci money and handle check
ing accounts, without some source
of income, would prove a costly
undertaking.
Therefore the bank must seek
some steady source of revenue,
and finds it in lending the money
of its stockholders and depositors
to those who can use more than
they have, and are willing to pay
for the accommodation. And
only as it loans its funds, and gets
them bfick with interest can it
long operate as a going concern.
The peculiar fact of the matter
is that ;i dollar in the bank will
do as much work as from four to
five dollars elsewhere. In s tech
nical sense the banker does not
loan money, but credit. lie does
not wani your money to loan, but
to use (18 a basis of credit, and
one dollar to him is as good as
four for business purposes. This
may seem an impossible proposi
tion. Lot us prove it.
Experience lias proven tlmt
everybody does not want all their
money at the same time. If one
hundred people were each to de
posit one hundred dollars in a
bank, the banker could safely as
sume that not over one-quarter of
them would call for their money
at one time. As a matter of fact,
less than fifteen per cent would
do so; therefore, if out of every
dollar deposited the banker keeps
fifteen cents in money, he can
meet every ordinary demand for
cash. When an unusual call
arises, it is called a "bank run,''
which merely means that mere
than the usual number of people
are demanding their money at one
time.
Working on this theory, the
hanker does not, out of the hun
dred dollars you deposit. Lend, let
us say, ninety; he puts the hun
dred in his vault (in his reserve}
and discounts the notes of his
customers, placing the proceeds to
their credit against which they
can check, the same as if they had
deposited cash. The banker
works on the law of averages, and
seldom does this law fail him, for
as long as he has a certain per
centage of his obligations in cash,
or quickly available, he is safe.
(The amount of reserve money
varies, in no case being legally re
quired to he more than 18 per
cent of the deposits.)
If. therefore, the banker with
one dollar in money can lend ten
in credit when you hold hack the
ten. you deprive the community
of the hundred in credit. The
banker is a credit alchemist, mak
ing one dollar do the work of
many, and you owe it to him, to

yourself and to your community
to make the credit structure as
lii; and as strong as possible.
The place for every dollar that
you do not need for your daily
iii'i'cssities is in the bank, for the
bank will not only protect it
against fire and thieves, pay it
back on demand, but by the al
chemistic process known only to
banking, turn it into ten credit
dollars, which are as effective in
the business world as money dol
lars and cheaper. This is the
bank's greatest service to the
community and to you.
