BY- N. D. COCHRAN.
When Bob Sweitzer made a speech to the First Ward Democratic club
he thanked the members for having done their DUTY at the lagt city elec
tion, and said the Democrats had learned a lesson from last year's defeat.
He said he was anxious to be mayor of Chicago, and added: "There
was, therefore, a sense of keen personal disappointment In the unlooked
for result I confess I was hurt, but what disappointed and HURT ME
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, the thing that cut me to the quick and
hurts me yet, is that I WAS DENIED AN OPPORTUNITY to do a lot of
good things for a lot of good fellows who had stood loyally and faithfully
by us in that fight" (Cheers.)
That is a frank and human statement of the spoils system that means
government of, by and for the organization.
