The fact that Klamath county's
youngsters are unusually healthy was
foiclbly demostrated at the Belter
Babies Health Exhibit, which closed
yesterday. A total of eighty-three
babies were examined and scored by
the staff of physicians and nurses,
nnd the general average of their
M-orea was 97 1-2 pur tent.
There were a good many bibles
scored at 100, or "perfect."
The Better Rabies Health Exhibit
was given by the Woman's Library
club solely to better the condition of
the babies in Klamath Falls, through
having them examined free of cost
by local physicians, who volunteered
their services without charge, simply
to help out the work of tho club
women. All expenses incurred were
paid by the club, and If only one
baby's condition is benefitted by the
show, examination and lectures, the
club women fee amply repaid for
their efforts.
In fact, the club is already planning
to hold a still bigger show next year.
The attendance at the sessions Thurs
day and Friday proved the work to
be one of Interest to all. Thecouncil
rooms were crowded all yesterday af
ternoon, nnd even the halls were
filled with interested visitors.
Miss Marie West, a graduate nurse,
who postponed her departure for Chi
cago in order to assist the local club
In Its work, took an active part in
the health exhibit, and her efforts
were greatly appreciated by the club.
Mrs. George J. Wright, Mrs. Paul Bo
gnrdus and Mrs. Warren Hunt, also
graduates of tho training schools of
some of the nation's best hospitals,
were also active, especially In the con
ducting of the tests and examinations.
The Library club wishes to extend
thanks to the following for assistance:
Dr. Nancy N. White, who gave the
whole of two days to helping In the
examining and measuring of the
babies.

and others who so generously gave

show.
