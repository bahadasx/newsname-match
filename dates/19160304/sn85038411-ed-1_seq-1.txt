At an early conference to-day ad
ministration leaders in the House de
cided not to Insist on a vote to-day.
This afternoon the Rules Committee
will meet to frame a rule to table the
McLemore resolution to warn Am
ericans off the armed ships of the
European belligerent.
The rule will be brought in with
ihe first business Monday when the
administration forces plan to dispose
>!' it by a substantial majority. The
Foreign Affairs Committee already
lias agreed on tin resolution.
Administration forces plan that the
tction in the Mouse shall give no room
fot* doubts of the decisive character
of the sentiment in Congress. They
plan that the action to table the Me
l.emore resolution will include a
declaration that the President shall
handle diplomatic affairs without Con
gressional interference.
The leaders are confident they have
the votes to make their victory com
plete and undisputed.
Leaders explained that the post
ponement was agreed upon because of
!he absence of so many members on
week-end trips. Many left yesterday
under the Impression, it was said, that
the House session to-day which began
at ten o'clock was to end at noon and
would consider only claim bills.
Majority Leader Kitchin, soon after
noon began notifying menders that

next Tuesday at the earliest.
The probability that a vote would
not be reached before Tuesday de
veloped ill the conference. Speaker

as it would interfere with the unani
mous consent calendar.
Hi ports of a special rule to give the
House an opportunity to vole 0:1 the
straight warning issue instead of
tabling the Mcl.emore resolution were
circulated. Majority Leader Kitchin
said such a move had been discussed.
Such action would not be disagree
able to the President.

Important Report Subnlitted
to the Governor by Engi
neers Commission
RESULT OF LONG STUDY
Relief That Technical Men
Should Re Under State Su
pervision Is Set Forth
Recommendation that engineers,
surveyors or technical men in public
service where competency may be
established .by examination should be
subject to State or municipal civil ser
vice regulations: that there be a State
board to supervise registration of
technical men and that the State
Board of Public Grounds and Build
ings be made a board of public works
are made in the report of the State
Engineers' Commission presented to
Governor Brumbaugh to-day. The
commission was named by Governor
Tenor in 1314 and consisted of F. Her
bert Snow, chairman: John Price
Jackson, secretary: Samuel A. Taylor.
Pittsburgh: George S. Webster, Phil
adelphia. and J. Murray Africa. Hunt
ingdon.
The commission has made* what is
considered to have been the most ex
haustive study of engineering and its
practice and engineers and their rela
tion to, public work. The chief rec
ommendation is that there should be
a State board or commission to have
charge of registration of engineers
for practice in the State, that in tlrst
and second class cities the civil ser
vice boards could conduct such exami
nations as necessary and in the rest of
the State the proposed State commis
sion should be in charge of tests.
Consulting engineers or temporarily
engaged engineers would not be sub
ject to examinations. Certificates of
Illness could be issued.
It is suggested that public service
companies should be exempted from
1 the civil service regulation
system works out on State or other
public operations: that plans and
specifications for public works to be
built or operated by public service
companies should be handled by prop
er branches of the State government
and that the State board or commis
sion in charge of engineers act in
advisory capacity 011 employment of
i consulting or temporary engineers and
also have authority to investigate
charges of incompetence or derelic
, tion.
The report suggests that the State
Economy and Efficiency Commission
work out the details of a plan where
■ by the scope and duties of the Board
of Public Grounds and Buildings may
be enlarged so that it shall direct all
1 public works through bureaus which
I shall make all plans for State build

■ neering details, purchase all supplies,
oversee all State property and also
have charge of State civil servixe ex
, animations to have supervision of

LA PROVENCE PACKED WITH TROOPERS SUNK I
This former French line steamship, converted into an auxiliary cruiser, carried about 4,000 troops and mem- ,'
bers of she crew from France to Saloniki when she went down in the Mediterranean 011 February 26 after being |
hit bv a torpedo or a mine. Fewer than 1,000 aboard were saved. l>a Provence was a 22-knots-an-hour vessel, of I
18.400 tons. She made her maiden voyage as a liner from Havre to New York in April ,1906. At the outbreak of ]-
the war she was taken over by the French government. \ 1
Pit-is, March 4.—lt was announced
at the French ministry of ntarinp that
there were nearly 4,000 men on board
the French auxiliary cruiser La Pro
vence when she was sunk in the Medi

It is stated that on board the Pro
vence were the staff 01' the Third Co
lonial Infantry Regiment, the Third
Battalion, the second company of the
First Battalion, the second machine
gun company and one extra company.
As the ministry of marine on Feb
ruary 29 announced that the number
of survivors of the Provence disaster
was estimated at 870, it is indicated
3,130 lives were lost.
This loss of life is the greatest ocean
disaster of modern times. Up to the
