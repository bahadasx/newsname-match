The Athenaeum Will Have The
Usual Open Session This
Year.
TWO NEW MEMBERS ADMITTED
Excellent Program With Papers
By Dr. Sights and Judge
Hanbery.
An unusually fine meeting of the
Athenaeum was held Thursday night,
.with 21 members present.
Dr. H. P. Sights read an excellent
paper on "The Death of the Spirit of
a Nation, being a discussion ot tne
Indian problem from a sentimental
and historical standpoint.
Judtre Hanbery's paper, the sub
ject of which was not given, proved
to be a splendid treatment of "Pre
paredness," the Judge's argument
leading to a system of national high
ways as one of the most important
steps to mobilize an army. He made
the astounding disclosure that money
spent for the panama canal would
have constructed fen highways at
$5,000 a mile from ocean to ocean and
belted the entire country, paralleling
the borders north and south and both
ocean fronts. He incidentally op
posed any interference with the Mon
roe doctrine. Both papers brought
out the usual general and prolonged
discussion.
Dr. Gant Gaither and Rev. J. N.
Jessup were elected to, membership.
Dr. Jessup was notified and attended
the meeting.
The usual "May banquet was deter
mined upon for the evening of Thurs

At The Rate of a Mill
Pounds a Week on Loose
Floor.
PRICES SLIGHTLY IMPROVED
Season's Sale More Than
Per Cent. Ahead of Last
Year.
30
With seemingly no especial excite
ment, the loose floors continue their
record of selling a million pounds of
tobacco every week at something like
$55,000. This has been done for the
last four weeks. Better types are
coming in and the prices are a little
higher than before.
The sales are now away ahead of
the same time last season. The
farmers generally have seemingly de
cided to sell now, fearful of an even
weaker market in the future.
The receipts at the warehouses also
continue heavy, but no figures are as
vet available in rerard to the amount
sold through that channel.
GOOD PRIVATE SALE.
One of the best sales made this
week was a private sale of Jas. A
McKenzie, of Edgoten, to Smith &
Walker for $8.50, So and $3. The
crop contained 50,000 pounds and the
average price was $7.25. The sale
was at the barn. It is a good heavy
body, 24-inch dark red, heavy fired
tobacco suitable for African fat or
Regie export trade. Mr. McKenzie got
$8.50 last year for a similar crop.

THIS EVENING

At The McLean
Gym.
The much looked for game with
Paducah will be played tonight (Sat
urday) at Belmont gym, tho old Mc
Lean gym. This game is looked
forward to with a great deal of inter
est, as the winner will be considered
the better team, having won two out
of tho three games played. The
rivalry between these two schools has
always been very great during foot
ball season but this year the rivalry
seems to be between the two basket
ball teams. Paducah intends to bring
quite a crowd of rooters with them
and unless the local supporters turn
out in goodly numbers the Paducah
supporters will be more than the sup
porters of the Orange and Black.

ably be given a chance in this game
as Coach Mallory wants to seo what

The Trenches on Ypres
Canal They Lost.
Paris, March 3. German attacks of
great violence, both artillery and in
fantry, have been resumed to tho
north of Verdun. The official state
ment issued by the French war office
says that furious infantry assaults
have been repulsed by the French
troops "whose fire decimated the
ranks of the enemy."
Berlin, March 3. The official Ger
man statement says the French sacri
ficed men unsuccessfully in a counter
attack on Fort Douamont, one of the
outlying defenses of Verdun, which
was captured by the Germans. The
situation on the Franco-Belgian ironr,
the communication says is unchanged.
London, Marcli 3. The British
official statement issued on the fight
ing in the Western zone says:
"We captured the trenches at the
bluff of Yprcs-Comines canal which
were lost Feb. 14 and also captu. ed a
small salient in the German line."
The Germans have resumed their
heavy offensive in the region of Ver
dun, with the French everywhere
strongly opposing it. While over
most of the front, from the east of tho
Meuse down into the Woevre region,
the German big guns have been ac
tive, around Douaumont the Teutons
launched several infantry atttacks of
extreme violence. These, the French
war office declares were put down by
the French troops, whose fire deci
mated the enemy ranks. Le Mort
Homme, the cote du Poivre and the
Douaumont sector particularly have
suffered heavy bombardments.
Northeast of St. Mihiel the French
guns have been worked eliectiveiy
against the German positions. In Al
sace, in the region of Scppois, a heavy
irtillery duel has been in progress.
The British along the Yprcs-Comi
nes canal have reserved the victory
gained over them by the Germans
Feb. 14 by retaking the 80O yards of
trenches which the Germans captured
at that time. The German mine gal
leries In the trenches were destroyed
and four officers and 176 men were
taken prisoners. In addition, French
guns have destroyed a German work
in the region of Beuvraignes, which
lies between the Somme and Oise
rivers.
The situation remains unchanged
on the Kussian and Austro-itauan
fronts. In Asia the Russians are
keeping up their strong offensive
against the Turks.
Nothing definite has transpired with
regard to the report that tho German
commerce raider Moewc had been
captured and taken into Trinidad by
British cruisers. A dispatch from
Trinidad says nothing is known there
concerning the Moewe.
