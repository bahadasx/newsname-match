Phoenix stands in danger of
losing her three National Guard
companies, A. is. and b . The
business men of the capital are
strangely apathetic toward the
militia, says Adjutant General
Charles W. Harris, and many
discourage their employes from
joining, it is said that a num
ber of the guardsmen who did
strike duty at Clifton lost their
positions because of their long
absence. It is now very difficult
to secure enlistments. Promises
of financial support for an ar

adjutant general declares.
Congressman Carl Hayden has
introduced a bill in the house of
representatives providing for an
appropriation of $25,000,000 to
be prorated among the several
states for the purpose of aiding
the states in building good roads
According to the terms of this
bill the highway department will
submit plans for proposed con
struction to the Secretary of
Agriculture, who will then de
termine in each case the propor
tion of the estimated cost to be
born by the federal government
which shall not be less than 30
per cent arid not more than 50
per cent, the balance to be con
tributed by the state.
The big warehouse at Nogales
which is 326x76 feet in size, is
completed. The building is di
vided into several compartments,
several of which are already
bonded by the Government. A
manager is in charge, who is re
ceiving and delivering merchan
dise daily. This is one of the
greatest assets of the county,
and is really an indication of the
approach of Nogales to city-size.
By means of this warehouse, im
porters and merchants may store
their goods in either the open
or bonded department, for which
he gets warehouse receipts that
may be used in commercial tran
sactions. This is the custom in
the larger cities. Patagonian.
The committee appointed at
the meeting in El Paso of the
New Mexico Cattle Sanitary
Board, outlined a plan for the
cieation of inspectors' districts
at a cenference at the board's
headquarters here recently. The
plan will be submitted to the
board at the meeting to be held
here while the Panhandle and
Southwestern Stockmen's Asso
ciation is meeting. The object
aimed at is more efficient inspec
tion. Under the district plan
twelve or thirteen inspectors
will be employed in addition to
the present force. The inspect
ors probably will be armed with
mounted police commissions. A
supervisor will have charge of
each district, according to the
plan. Albuquerque Journal.
Bills amending the workmen's
compulsory compensation law,
creating a state department of
labor, and providing for a state
architect, have been drawn by
the legislation committee of the
Arizona Federation of Labor.
The bills are to be initiated and
submitted to the voters at the
general election in November.
Silver Belt.
Steps taken by the state land
department assure that the land
holdings of the University of
Arizona are to be increased by
8,869,86 acres. In 1881 congress
passed a law granting each of
several territories 72 sections of
land for their universities. Ari
zona was one of those territories
and 72 sections of timber land in
Coconino county were selected.
But 8,869,86 acres of the selec
tion were rejected because it was
on unsurveyed land. Until re-'
cently no steps were taken to
select lieu land. The land de
partment has received assur
ances from Washington that the
grant law is still effective and a
selection will be made as soon
as possible. It is possible that
timber land can be secured.
That which was rejected has
since been included in the Coco
nino national forest.
High School Wins Championship.
When the singles matches
were won by members of the
Tucson high school tennis team
on the university courts Satur
day, the individual champion
ship passed into the hands of
the prep school members.
In the first match Miss Rebeil
defeated Miss Murphy, 7-5, 4 6,
6 0. The second match went to
the university when Miss Anna
Pistor defeated Miss Crowell,
6-1, 7 5. In the third, Miss Han
kins was defeated by Miss Bran

contests. The scores were 6-3

MUST REGISTER.
Under the law, all residents
of Arizona who desire to cast
their votes at the primary and
general elections held this year,
must register. Under our law,
bennial registrations are requir
ed. Section 2883 of the Revised
Statutes of Arizona, 1913, reads:
2883. It shall be the duty of
every elector in the state of Ari
zona, between the first Monday
in May, and the 28th day of Oct
ober, 1914, and between the same
dates, bennially, thereafter, to
register with some notary pub
lic or justice or the peace, or
with the county recorder of the
county in which the elector re
sides, in accordance with this
chapter."
Under the old law, electors
were carried on a great register
from year to year, and only new
names added. Now all must re
gister. The registration books
will be opened May 1. Regis
tration officers will probably al
so be appointed in due time. As
there always appears to be a
number of people who miss the
registrars and forget to to at
tend to the duty of registration,
early and frequent notice of re
gistration will be given in the
public press for the benefit of
those who read the newspapers.
Those who do not read some of
the Arizona papers constitutes a
small minority.
WHY PRINCE ALBERT WINS.
Patented Process Is Responsible for
Its International Popularity.
Smokers so much appreciate
the flavor and coolness and aro
ma of Prince Albert pipe and
cigarette tobacco that they often
marvel that this one brand could
be so different from all others.
The answer to this question is
to be found on the reserve side
of every Prince Albert package,
where you will read: "Process
Patented July 30th, 1907." That
tells the whole story. Prince
Albert is made by a patented
process that cuts out the bite
and parch, which makes the to
bacco so mighty agreeable and
satisfying to men of every taste
of every civilized nation on the
globe.
Smokers should realize that
this patented process cost three
years continuous work and study
and a fortune in money to per
fect. But the result has proven
to be worth all that was expend
ed upon it. because it has set
free men who believed they
never could enjoy a pipe or a
makin's cigarette.
Prince Albert makes it possi
ble for every man to smoke a
pipe or to roll his own cigarettes.
And, no matter how tender the
tongue, Prince Albert cannot
bite or parch. That is cut out
by the patented process, leaving
for the smoker only the joys of
the fragrant tobacco.
It is a fact that since Prince
Albert "arrived," just about six
years ago, it has made three men
smoke pipes where one smoked
a pipe before!

To start off the good roads
movement in good order and to
assist the Supervisors and Coun
by Engineer in their big work of
making improvements on roads
in Santa Cruz county, a number
of public spirited citizens of Pa
tagonia this week had a crew of
men put to work on the road be
tween Patagonia and Nogales.
Workmen were employed to
throw rocks out of the road and
make other improvements, so
that vehicles could make the trip
over this much-used thorough
fare to the county seat with
greater convenience.
The citizens who are taking
part in this very commendable
enterprise, to the extent of fur
nishing either money or men, or
both, for the work are: R. R.
Richardson, O. F. Ashburn, Ray
Sorrells, E. E. Bethell, C. L.
Northcraf t, and probably others.
These men will have work done
on this road to the Sorrells place,
which is estimated as about half
way to Nogales.
Citizens of Nogales will pro
bably repair their part of the
roads from the city limits up to
where the work of the Patago
nia men left off, and thus the
most used road in this county
will be put into fairly good con
dition while awaiting the money
from the road bonds with which
to make permanent improve
ments. Patagonian.
In reply to a letter from Sen
ator Stone, chairman of the
senate foreign relations com
mittee, last week, the President
said:
"I very warmley appreciate
your kind and frank letter of to
day and feel that it calls for an
equally frank reply.
"You are right in assuming
that I shall do everything in my
power to keep the United States
out of war. I think the country
will feel no uneasiness about my
course in that respect. Through
anxious months I have striv
en for that object, amidst diffi
culties more manifold than can
have been apparent upon the
surface, and so far I have suc
ceeded. I do not doubt that I
shall continue to succeed. The
course which the central Europ
ean powers have announced as
their intention of following in
the future with regard to under
sea warfare seems for the mo
ment to threaten insuperable ob
tacle, but its apparent meaning
is so manifestly inconsistent
with explicit assurances recently
given U3 by the powers with re
gard to their treatment of mer
chant vessels on the high seas,
that I must believe that explana
tions will presently ensue which
will put a different aspect on it.
We have no reason to question
their good faith or their fidelity
to their promises in the past,
and I for one feel confident that
we shall have none in the future.
HAYDEN WILL HELP.
Our friend, Congressman Hay
den did not lose any time get
ting busy on a proposition to
solve the flood problems on non-
navigable streams, and, especial
ly speaking for his own State,
he delivered a speech in the
House of Representatives, Feb
ruary 3d that convinced Con
gress that he was truly aware of
the conditions in his State and
the remedy needed.
If anything can be done to
help our farmers save their
lands from the ravages of the
Gila river in flood times, we be
lieve that Congressman Hayden
will be the one to get it, and now
that Congress has before it a
proposition to create a commit
tee on flood control, it may be
that some way will be found by
such a committee in which help
can be secured to Keep sucn
rivers withic their original banks
during flood times. The Guardian.
Our Duty Clear.
"But in any event our duty is
clear. No nation or group of
nations has the right while the
war is in progress to alter or dis
regard the principles which all
nations have agreed upon in
mitigation of the horrors and
sufferings of war; and if the
clear rights of American citizens
should ever unhappily be abridg
ed or denied by any such action,
we should, it seems to me, have
in honor no choice as to what
our own course should be.
"For my own part, I cannot
consent to any abridgement of
the rights of American citizens in
any respect. The honor and self
respect of the nation is involved.
We covet peace and shall pre
serve it at any cost but the loss
of honor. To forbid our people
to exercise their rights for fear
we might be called upon to vin
dicate them would be deep hum
iliation indeed. It would be an
implicit, all but an explicit, ac
quiescence in the violation oi
the rights of mankind every
where and of whatever nation
or allegiance. It would be a de
liberate abdiction of our hither
to proud position as spokesmen
even amid the turmoil of war
for the law and the right. It
would make everything this
government has attempted and
everything that it has achieved
during this terrible struggle of
nations meaningless and futile.
No Expediency.
"It is important to reflect that
if in this instance we would per
mit expediency to take the place
of principle, the door would in
evitably be opened to still fur
ther concessions. Once accept
a single abatement of right and
many other humiliations would
certainly follow and the whole
fine fabric of international law
might crumble under our hands
piece by piece. What we are
contending for in this matter is
of the very essence of the things
that have made America a sov
ereign nation. She cannot yield
them without conceding her own
impotentency as an nation and
making virtual surrender of her
independent position among the
nations of the world.
"I am speaking my dear Sen
ator in deep solemnity without
heat, with a clear conciousness of
the high responsibilities of my of
fice, and as your devoted friend.
If we should unhappily differ, we
shall differ as friends; but where
issues so momentous as these
are involved we must, just be
cause we are friends, speak our
minds without reservation."
