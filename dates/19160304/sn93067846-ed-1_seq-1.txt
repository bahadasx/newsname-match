Washington, Feb. 29.?The cam?
paign for national preparedness will
enter on a new phase in congress neat
week when in all probability bills
providing for increasing the army 4o
an ext-nt never before contemplated
in time of peace will be introduced In
both the house and senate.
The house military committee .will
begin tomorrow its final review of the
measures tentatively agreed upon last
week which, it is stated, will be al?
tered only in minor details before
is favorably reported. The final vot
probably will be taken Thursday,
it will require several days for
man Hay to prepare a report to ac?
company the bill. \
The senate committee agreed today1
to insert only a general provision ml
federalization of the Natlor al Guard
in its regular army reorganisation
measure, leaving the task of putting*
this legislation .in final shape to the
I joint conference committee to which
the two bills will go. By tills action
the senate committee mad* it pos?
sible to bring out its bill also next
week.
Before the-house naval committee
Rear Admiral Knight continued to?
day his recommendations that every
I facility in the country be employed to
hasten construction of a fleet equal to
those of any two nations except Great
Britain. American policies such as
the Monroe doctrine, Asiatic exclu?
sion, control of the Panama canal
and the open door in China, he de?
clared, constituted a great and grow?
ing threat of war unless adequate
preparations to uphold them are
made.
Admiral Knight said he believed it
Would take two years and a half to
meet the pr?sent German fleet wjprt
any hope of success. The time .limit
he set was the minimum required to
build nine battlecruisers and eight
fast scouts. He said it would take 18
months to put the ships oi the At?
lantic fleet in full readiness for war.
"Not that we would not make a good
showing against any force in much
less time," he added.. .
Representative Fair asked if it
would not be necessary to begin con?
struction immediately in all available
government yards if a great number
of capital ships were to be built in a
hurry. He called attention to pub?
lished figures stating that in the last
10 years Germany had built 1Y3 Ashl?
ing ships, England 252 and the United
States 64. Admiral Knight said he
understood a subcommittee of the
naval committee would be appointed
later to investigate the subject of
shipbuilding facilities, public and
private. He advised that the Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, Norfolk,
Mare Island and Puget Sound yards
be equipped immediately for their
maximum output of big ships.
Maj. Gen. Barnett, commander of
the marine corps, followed Admiral
Knight, urging that 150 officers, 52
warrant officers and 2,379 men be
[added to the corps to bring It up to the
strength advanced by the general
board, which Is on the basis of one
fifth of the strength of the navy per?
sonnel. He asked also that the one
fifth standard be written Into per?
manent law.
Gen. Barnett said he had prepared
and Secretary Daniels would present
to congress at once legislation design?
ed to permit marine officers to ac?
cept service under the Haltien gov?
ernment in the constabulary now that
the treaty ^ias been ratified.
Representative TUson of the house
military committee addressed the
house today on a feature of the pre?
paredness plans on which he his
dwelt at length In committee hear?
ings. Backing up his remarks with
exhibits from various arsenals, he said
that while there were hundreds of
gun and ammunition factories In op?
eration In this country, none hut gov?
ernment plants were prepared to pro?
duce the weapons and cartridges
needed by the American navy
A bill to provide for the manufac?
ture of special tools and flxiures to
nmko the necessary changes in pri?
vately owned machines has teen In?
troduced by Mr. Tilson. He estimated1
It would cost from $15,000,000 to

a step were taken tho country could

Possible That Plan Will Have Effect
of Bringing Declaration of War by

London, Feb. 29.?It was announc?
ed In the house of commons today
that the Italian government had re?
quisitioned 34 of the 37 German
steamers interned in Italian ports.
Recent reports from London said
that grave Interest was being display?
ed in England over the possibility
of a declaration of war on Germany
by Italy when the Italian parliament
opened March 1.

TO MEET NEW CAMPAIGN.
German Ships May he Prey of Ger?
man Submarines.
Washington, Feb. 29.?Announce?
ment of Italy's seizure of German
ships in her waters attracted much
attention in official and diplomatic
circles and in some quarters the be
lief was expressed that the seizure i
was the first of a series of acts which
eventually might lead to war be?
tween Italy and Germany.
One of the leading explanations ad?
vanced for Italy's action was that she
proposed to answer the new Ger?
manic submarine campaign which
goes into effect at midnight by send?
ing German-owned ships to sea to
meet the Teutonic submerslbles.
The ships seised by Italy are worth
millions of dollars. A total of 57
German and Austrian vessels are in
Italian ports, the Austrian ships hav?
ing been seized when Italy declared
War on the dual monarchy.
The entente nations are short of
ships and therefore transfer of the
Gorman vessels to the flag of Italy
and their use by the entente allies
would do much towards relieving the
congestion of goods on American
docks awaiting shipment to the allied
countries,

month would see an ample supply
produced.
The senate military committee
agreed tentatively today to amend
the present act so that a third force,
exclusive of the regular army or the
National Guard, may be organized In
peace times. It is proposed to insert
a general provision in the pending
bill under which the restriction of or?
ganization of federal volunteers to
war time would be removed and the
president given the widest possible lat?
itude as to questions of enlistment,
arms, training and other details to in?
sure a practical test of this method of
raising a citizen army. In effect, the
proposal Is to supply the authority for
a test of the continental army plan. A
provision with the same end in view Is
now included in the house bill and the
final judgment on the plan will be
worked out in conference.
Members of the house committee in
closest touch with its efforts towards
federallzatlon of the National Guard
said today that while It was proposed
In the bill to ko to the limit of con?
stitutional authority in this regard
they believed a constitutional amend?
ment sweeping aside all State jurisdic?
tion would be necessary in the end.
Hope was expressed that agitation for
such an amendment would come from
the guardsmen themselves.

SOUTH CAROLINA EXCEPTION
SHEET IS DISCUSSED.
Railroad Commission Will Give Both
Railways and Shippers Still Further
Hearing?Action Deferred in Mean?
time.
Columbia, March 2.?After a long
hearing yesterday the railroad com?
mission announced that the final ac?
tion would be taken at a later date on
the question of eliminating the South
Carolina exception sheet. The peti?
tion asking that the sheet be eliminat?
ed was filed several months ago by the
railways. Yesterday the shippers
filed a strong protest against the pro?
posed action.
The following order was signed:
"After having heard the shippers of
the State upon the ition submitted
by the carriers of .4 Corolina for
elimination of the th Carolina ex?
ception sheet, th< 3 m mission fee is
free to state tha JT y are not war
ranted in grant! ? ie request of the
I carriers at this i ^ It has been the
practice of the s mission, on mat?
ters of great nr at such as the
present, to allo w j fullest and freest
opportunity to inrtles to a contro?
versy to be he S The railroads have
been heard in ,; the shippers have
been heard ir t; and on account Of
the further consideration that this
| commission has previously notified
both the shippers and the carriers m
alL of its circulars that the course ae
outlined herein would be pursued, the
commission is of the unanimous opin?
ion that final action on this matter
should be taken at a date to be named
later, at which time both the represen?
tatives of the carriers and the repre?
sentatives of the shippers shall be
i given on opportunity to be heard. We
desire to reiterate that in all questions
of the magnitude of this one, the
commission feels that the greatest care
should be oxerclsed."
E. Walker Duvall of Cheraw, chair?
man of the special committee of five
named by the shippers, was the first
to make argument before the cornmls
Is^m^tsalb^st^e ellmlnatfjs^s|f (Jjsfl
was the only protection of the
pers of the State. John A Russell
Greenville, a wholesale grocer, told the
commission that the change would in?
jure the business of the wholesale
merchants. C. S. Monteith, speaking
for the Columbia Chamber of Com?
merce, said that a brief would be
filed later by Frank Wllby, rate* ex?
pert, showing that the change would
cause on increase in rates. Charles
Kimmlch, rate expert of the Charles?
ton Chamber of Commerce, pointed
out several instances where rate in?
crease would follow elimination of
the exception sheet.
The railway lines of the State were
not represented a. the hearing yester?
day. The commission will announce
a date for the hearing to be held when
the railways and shippers will be
heard again.

PEACE OFFICERS ACTIVE.
Report? of Solicitors Show Increase
in Cases and in Convictions Also.
Columbia, March 1.?Comparative
figures for 1914 and 1915 from the re?
ports of the solicitors, incorporated in
the annual report of the attorney gen?
eral, show that in 1914 2,591 cases
were reported as compared with 3,
210 cases last year. In the former
year there were 1,634 convictions, or
63 per cent., as compared with 2,121
convictions last year or 66 per cent.
The increase in the number of cases
in 1915 over 1914 was 619, or 24 per
cent.
It is urged that these figures dem?
onstrate the greater activity of peace
officers and the growing disposition
; among jurors to return verdicts of
! guilty.
