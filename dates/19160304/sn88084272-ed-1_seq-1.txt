BIG INCREASE r
PROVIDED FOR
Mobile Army Would Com
prise 117 Regiments, with
Many Auxiliaries.
WASHIXliTOX, D. C, March 4.
The senate army bill was in
troduced today by chairman:
Chamberlain of the military affairs com
mittee. It proposes the moot thorough
measures of military preparedness ever
presented to conRTess in peace times, and
is the first of the national defence bills
urged by president Wilson to be com
pleted and introduced. It is believed
the measure will pass.
The measure proposes to increase the
peace strength of the regular army to
178 000 men of all arms; to federalize
the national guard with a peace sticngth
of 217,000 men; to create a federal
volunteer army comparable to tho con
tinental army proposed b?1 former secre
tary Garrison of the war department; to.
provide adequate reserve systems of the
under short-term
MftWrs,
doctors, mechanics and all otber civilian
supporters of the fighting troops and
to pro ide an officers reserve corps v. itn
definite obligations to the government.
Federalization of -Militia.
Under the senate plan, federalization
of tho national guard is propoeil under
a military bill and the authority of the
national government over the body in
times of peace or war is widely ex
tended to secure adequate training and
discipline.
"It is the most comprehensive meas
ure in the wav of preparedness ever
presented to either house of congresg,"
senator Chamberlain said. Tlie essen
tial features comprise a sufficient in
crease in the regular army to enable
the mobile force to lie organized in
divisions and brigades, and to provide
a sufficient corps of coast artillery to
man the existing nnd approved new
batteries.
117 Regiments in Mobile Army.
"The mobile army .will comprise G4
regiments of infantrv. organized into
seven divisions; 25 regiments of cavalry
organized into two divisions nnd the
remaining regiments attached to infantry
divisions: 21 regiments of field artillery
and seven regiments of engineers. This
will give proper carirsons to Panama,
Hawaii and' the Philippines and provide
four infantrv and two cavalry divisions
within the United States."

"Our counter attack took place Febru
ary 22 at 4: JO o"clock in the morning. Then
tho Ilochea attacked again. No one had tho
advantage In thla affair. Then, during the
da there was on both sides an unceasing
struggle with hand grenades while aome of
our men strained every effort, under the
protection of the grenade throwers, to con
tnlltlAU our positions. At thla moment we
n. longer had any natural shelter. Here
hois la covered with tree stumps among
which some large treea stand up, but the
oermans had opened up on It on a terrible
outpouring of projectiles and the wood at
certain places was transformed Into a clear

ver through this confusion by climbing and
crawling and to raise barricades and or
ganise the shell holes. It was -mowing,
and I leave you to Imagine th endurance
which our men showed in the circum
stances. Germans Die Howling.
"During the night of February 52, the
Germans lenewed their offensive. A nom
bardment of amaxing violence and of a
mortal precieeness did not permit them,
however, to advance an inch. When their
Infantry. In turn attempted to strike our
men. they met with sanguinary losses. It
was still worse, the day of the 23rd. After
having once more copiously rained shelH on
our lines the Germans sent against us at
least the equivalent of a battalion. This at
tack In a hnttv ..vrltMl tn the hlaheat de

the Oermans at 50 meters and under meth
odic volleys the latter fell, howling In ter
rible fashion. It was a veritable massacre.
Few of Enemy Reach Rear.
"Our TS millimeter guna on their side had
erected a curtain fire preventing the enemy
from retiring and very few of the assail
ants succeeded In getting to the rear. Al
most all weto left on the field of battle.
That did not prevent the Germans from
attacking us once more during the day but
without any better success.
"Four of our grenadiers, posted at the
entrance of a communicating trench which
united our old firing trench now occupied
by the Oermans with a supporting trench,
which we still held, killed groups of tho
enemy as fast as they showed themselves.
French Display Valor.
"They carried on this work for more
than 20 hours. During these fights was
Tevealed once more the warlike ardor of tha
Franch. .Despite tho losses Incurred (almost
all exclusively from artillery fire, for tn the
infantry engagement we had constantly the
upper hand), their morale did not waver for
a moment. Our troopers maneuvered as
.during field practice.
"They saw without a murmur, their com
rades fall around them and they continued
their work as quietly as at exercise. One
haa reason to be proud of commanding
such men.

At 4:15 on the afternoon of February J.

"Our ships In American harbors and

Incalculable prolongation of the war
