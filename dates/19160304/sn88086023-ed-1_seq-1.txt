OUR OAST.
NEW YORK. Match 4 "If war
were declared tomorrw, the navy un
der Daniels would Be absolutely Im
potent to check an nvasion of the I
coast," ex-Secretary Von Meyer de
clared today. He iound the follow
ing faults:
The navy Is wihoiu organization ol i
prepared to act on a war footing.
No tested war plan.
No tested mobilization plan.
No general staff or national counsel
of defense. No enlisted reserves. Only
a small supply of ammunition.
Shortage of Sgdfcted men and offi
cers on practically every ship.
No fast cruisers, except three obso
lete ones.
lacking In armed hydroplanes.
Submarine flotilla In a lamentable
condition. Fewer destroyers in commission
than In reserve.
Only 13 batleshlps. against 21 when
Daniels took office.
Five battleships of the Connecticut
class demonstrated they cannot ex
ceed 12 or 15 knots without danger
of breaking their drlveshafts.
Daniels has disorganized and de
moralized the organization he found
when he took office.
He has not appreciated the condi
tion the country has faced since the
European war began.
Meyer styled Daniels' hobby a
"pedagogic program." The remedies
lie with congress,- he declared. He
urged the immediate passage of ah
art to build four of the speediest bat
tle cruisers in the world.

If the industrial welfare commission
of the state carries out a proposed
change In Its rulings, reducing the
maximum limit of labor women girls
and minor boys from 54 hours a week
to 4S. the Saturday evening shopping
vill be virtually doomed, according
to some of the larger merchants.
Such a change Is being contemplat
ed but. according to telegraphic re
port from Portland today, the ruling
has not yet been made. A hearing
will be held in Portland Monday be
tween employers and the commission
ers to discuss the matter
At present the commission's rulings
prevent the employment of women or
minor boys more than six days a
week, more than 9 hours a day or
more than 54 hours a week. Under
that ruling the stores are able to keep
their women help for the Saturday
evening shopping, but the cutting off

About 5" representative local far-j

Mr. Harrah sold his grain to a local

lHnd dealers are assert ng that If grain j
Is handled without sacks here It will
have to lie resacked in Portland. In ,
the view of Mr. Harrah the assertion!
is a bluff.

WASHINGTON. March 4 Perplex
ed over the significance of the senate
vote on the Gore resolution to warn
Americans off armed ahtps. bouse
leaders postponed the vote on the Mc
Lemore resolution, similar to Gore's,
until Tuesday.
A difference of opinion In the rules
committee was mainly responsible for
the postponement. It was reported
that the house, with the president's
approval, might vote strictly on th
merits of the McLemore resolution In
stead of on the question of tabllnz
as the foreign committee recommend
ed Advocates of immediate action
urged that this be done because the
senate tabled a substitute proposal
without realizing its provisions.
The house must clear up the mud
dle, It was declared A discussion o
the armd ship Issue burst forth anew
in the senate tw&ay. Lodge tried to
insert Into the records a denial that
England, during the ROeeran-Japanese
war. ever warned her citizens to
avoid armed liners
Several questioned Lodge. McCum
ber denounced gag role by which the
administration suppressed a discus
sion of the warning Issue. A recess
was planned tonight to prevent talk
on the McCumber resolution.
Concerning, the tabling of the Gore
resolution yesterday. McCumber said
"If we take the usual construction of
this, the senate voted that the killing
of an American Is not a cause for
war."
WASHINGTON. March 4. If the
three Americans who left New York
on the liner Canoplc today are sub
marined, they would be the victims of
their own bravado and America ought
not to fight over their deaths, de
clared Senators Jones. McCumber.
Cummins. Hitchcock and Clapp. Ths
People do not understand the fine
spun international law. said Jones,
but can see the Injustice of plunging
a hundred million of persons into war
because of the criminal bravado of
these.
