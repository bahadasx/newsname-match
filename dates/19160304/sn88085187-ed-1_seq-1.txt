OH, SEE
Who Took a Fall Out
ol Infallibility!
Stand-pattish persons continually are telling us of the "infalli
bility" of judges, and especially of supreme court judges.
Please join with us in ajnerry haw-haw.
The other day our own 'infallible" state supreme court handed
down a decision in a libel ease against the Seattle Star. The Star had
criticised a (1. O. P. county chairman or secretary or something for
alleged shady activities.
Well, the eOUTt split FIVE ways in handing down its decision.
Which goes to show that there must have been a little individual falli
bility, even if the majority ruling was good.
One of the five opinions written by the nine judges came from
.lustice Chadwick.
It was bitterly censorious of The Star's course and disagreed
rather violently with the majority, which dismissed the suit.
The infallible Justice Chadwick based his decision, so he wrote, on
Rem. & Bal. 2777. Now the case was a civil proceeding, and the sec
tion of law he cited WAS FROM THE CRIMINAL STATUTES.
AND WHEN WE CAME TO LOOK UP HIS REFERENCE
TODAY WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SAID SECTION 2777 TO
WHICH HE SO GRAVELY POINTED WAS REPEALED SEV
EN YEARS AGO ANYWAY.
Congress Waits
for More Light
WASHINGTON, D. C, March
4. —Perplexed over the signifi
cance of the senate vote of the
Gore resolution to warn Ameri
cans to keep off of^rmed boats,
houseleaders have postponed a
vote on the McLemore resolution,
which is similar to Gore's, until
Tuesday.
A difference of opinion of the
rules committee is mainly respon
sible for the postponement, it is
reported that the house, with the
president's approval, might vote
strictly on the merits of McLe
more's resolution instead of on
the tabling as the foreign com
mittee recommended.
Advocates of immediate action
urged this because the senate
tabled a substitute proposal
without considering or realizing
its provisions. The house must
clean up the muddle, it is de
. clared.
The discussion of the armed
ship issue hurst forth anew to
day in the senate. Lodge tried
to Insert into the records a de
nial that England, during the
Rusßo-Japauese war, had ever
warned citizens to avoid armed
vessels. Several questioned Lodge.

The resignation of U 0. Parks,
city harbormaster, probably will
be asked during the next few
j days. Today he was called on

ordered to tell the council his
side of a story that he had >f
fered to handle Joseph Haw

fraternal votes to him, tor $1,

Parks was charged with hav
ing fought Hawthorne after the
latter had refused to deal with
him.
Mayor Fawcett, who appointed
Parks two years ago, asserted
after the hearing today that he
was not at all satisfied with the
harbormaster's political activi
ties.
Very Dignified al lirst.
The sentiment of the council
was expressed hy .Mills, who told
the commission that "this testi
mony shows Parks has been
'active in political matters, at the
time when he was supposed to
he working for the city.
When Parks was called before
the council hy Fawcett he aroi-e
in a dignified manner, and de
clared:
"T do not break confidences.
Neither do I reveal secrets.
Therefore 1 refuse to tell any
thing."
Just offered to Help.
Fawcett began cross-examining
his harbormaster, and Parks soon
found himself in the position of
an unwilling witness. He told
h|s story, but under pressure.
Parks declared that he had in
duced Hawthorne and Dr. H. V.
Hoyt both* (o run for office.
He said that he had told Haw
thorne that the campaign would
cost $1,500. He said that he
and Hawthorne were not alone
when the proposition was made.
Parks said he had figured cam
paign expenses lor other candi
dates, also.
He denied that he intended lo
manage Hawthorne's campaign.
"I offered to help, though," he
said.

Hawthorne, called before the
council, said that he and Parks
were alone when Parks told him
that the campaign would cost
$1,500.
"I knew that Parks wt»,B a
member of various organizations,
and 1 believed that he could
carry considerable influence for
me," he testified.
"It was suggested that Parks;
handle the campaign. He told
me that some money would be
necessary. I asked him how
much. He replied, 'At least $1,
--500.'
"Then I said, 'I quit. I don't
want to buy the office.' "
Hawthorne admitted under
questioning that he had only
seen Parks once since that con
versation. He had previously
said that he and Parks were in
timate friends of over 30 yean
standing.
"Safety First" Cards.
"Do you believe that lie turned
against you after you refused to
put up the $1,500?" asked Faw
cett.
"Well, I do know that after I
saw the 'Safety First' cards, I
had been left out of the combina
tion," replied Hawthorne.
The "Safety First" cards are
small cards carrying the names
of Stayton, Hoyt and Wylle, aa
