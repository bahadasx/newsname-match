Petrograd.Prince William of Swe
den (the Duke of Sudermania), the
king's second son. has presented a
collection to the museum at Stockholm
which is associated with great politi
cal events as well as with the shatter
ing of the romance of his marriage.
The collection was made on a hunting
expedition in East Africa, partly in
company with W. N. McMillan of St
Louis, and Nairobi, whither he went a
few years ago, after the divorce from
his wife, the Grand Duchess Marie Pav
lovna of Russia, a cousin of the czar.
The marriage was dissolved by the
Russian council of state March 20,
1914, negotiations having been made
between the governments at Stock
holm and Petrograd. It had been cele
brated at the Russian capital in May,
1908, and the wedding was one of the
most magnificent ever known in the
Russian court All difficulties betweei.

uncle, was considered a light hearted
girl who cared for nothing but a good
time and was not afraid of occasion-

ally shocking her relatives by jumping
over the taut traces of court etiquette.
As a young lady she had spent a great
deal of her life in Paris with her fa
ther, who had made a morganatic mar
riage with Countess Pistolkors after an
unsavory scandal and had been exiled
by the czar, but the grand duchess had
been brought up by her aunt, the
Grand Duchess Serge, the czarina's
sister, and had been educated to be
come a domestic, dignified wife of a
royal prince. Nobody guessed that
when she went to Stockholm and en
tered the family of the Swedish king
she would develop into the most astute
and dangerous spy whom the Russian
government could employ in the land
of its neighbor and possible enemy.
She. with the Russian military at
tache and the Russian minister at
Stockholm. M. Savinsky, gave her
government valuable information. The
threethe minister, the attache and
the grand duchessleft Sweden at the
same time. Prince William found no
trouble in keeping his little boy, born
in 1909. The mother apparently had
no desire for the child.
But the war found the three in Rus
sia, and the Grand Duke Paul was
allowed to return with his morganatic
wife. There the grand duchess, now
only twenty-six, has become in the
meantime immersed in charity work,
being at the head of a committee
which plans to look after the wounded
soldiers when they have recovered suf
ficiently to take up responsibilities of
existence, but are perhaps not strong
enough ever to return to the army.
With as much ability and energy as
she displayed at Stockholm as a spy
she is now displaying as the executive
head of a committee so important that
it has become an adjunct to the gov
ernment and receives a subsidy of mil
lions of dollars. The work is thorough
ly organized, the young grand duchess
having the assistance of a large staff,
but giving her orders in military fash
ion through her aid-de-camp. Colonel

Frozen to Death
Norwich, Conn.Byron P. Fox, an
Uncasville farmer, appeared in Nor

to show why Mr. Groundhog failed so
miserably as a weather prognosticator

admitted that until recently his confi

groundhog prophecy, a fine specimen of
the woodchuck was found frozen to
near Glasbrenner's livery and
garag in Uncasville recently.
"It must have been layin* near the
road there for over a week." said Mr.
Fox. "Cose, it didn't see its shadow

back afterward. Anyhow, it stayed

PLUMBERS MUSTN'T RIDE.
Union Forbids Them to Go on Bicy

Elkhart. Ind."We walk!" has been
the slogan of Elkhart journeyman
plumbers since the passing of a rule by
the union forbidding the use of bi
cycle or motorcycle in going to and
from "short jobs."
The penalty is a $5 fine. Men are
permitted under the rule to ride to
work for all day tasks and to use
wheels at the noon lunch hour, but
they must not make intervening trips
on wheels. They may be passengers at
any time in vehicles provided by their
regular employers.
The rule was the result of a boast at
a union meeting of one of the men that
he had completed an unusually large
number of "short jobs" during that
particular day because he used a bi
cycle. DIDN'T KNO W E WA S RICH.

MOTHER FINOS SON
AFTER LONG SEARCH
Father Stole Him, Then Was
Adopted From Home.
Webster City, la.Stolen from his
cradle by his own father thirty years
ago, later placed in a children's home
in Des Moins and adopted by a fam
ily at Lehigh, David Brundage now
finds himself the heir to an estate, all
because his mother during all these
thirty years has never once ceased her
search for him.
Brundage is now thirty-two years of
age and makes his home in Lehigh
with his foster parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Joe Brundage. Mrs. C. Thompson of
Randall, Wash., is the mother in the
case, and a letter just received from
her by the Brundage family states that
she located her son only recently. The
mother pleads with the foster parents
to tell her something of her son and his
whereabouts, whether he is dead or
alive and if he is happy.
Mr. and Mrs. Brundage adopted the
baby in 1887. He was a healthy
youngster and grew up with the other
Brundage children. Many people in
and about Lehigh did not even know
he was an adopted child. Every atten
tion was lavished upon him. While
young Brundage is anxious to learn all
he can of his mother and other blood
relatives, yet he signifies his intention
to remain with his affectionate foster
parents.
A. E. Watkins, a Randall (Wash.) at
torney, finally located the boy for his
inother, and a letter to him conveys
the information that an estate is held
in trust for young Brundage. As yet
however, the Brundage family has not
been apprised of the amount. It is like
ly that Brundage will make a visit to
his mother.

recently identified the remains of the
man, and on this identification a check
for $1,500 from an insurance company
was presented at the Becker home
here in payment of their loss. How
ever, the real Mr. Riley refused to let
bis sister cash the check.

Gray of Indiana, who made a vigorous
kick against the innovation in the

"The barking of the farm dog in the
middle of the night instead of the
crowing of the cock is now the signal
that the postman has arrived," Mr.
Gray said indignantly, "and the poor
farmer is forced to go out with a lan

BE GIVEN HONOR
City to Have Exclusive Holi
day, Recurring Annually.
FOR GENEROUS BENEFACTOR
Projected and Settled Upon at a Meet
ing of Citizens at Which Mayor Pre*
sidesWill Be Known as Proctor
Day, and People Are Asked'to Pay
Tribute. Utica, N. Y.Utica is to have an
other holiday, one entirely and exclu
sively its own, to be observed this year
and henceforth annually as long as the
city stands. It is to be known as Proc
tor day, in honor of a citizen, philan
thropist and benefactor who has done so
much for the citywho has surrounded
it with parks and established many of
its charitable and public enterprises.
Added, then, to the usual holidays of
the year, so far as Utica is concerned,
will be Proctor day, when the people
will cease from their labors and cele
brate the day in a fitting manner, look
ing forward to it from year to year as
an established occasion in the life of
the city.
All this was determined and settled
upon at a meeting of citizens held in
the common council chambers, the
mayor of the city, Hon. James D.
Smith, presiding.
Mayor Smith gave his indorsement of
the project, declaring that he was will
ing to serve in any capacity that would
be useful to the project D. F. Howe,
secretary of the chamber of commerce,
was chosen secretary, and he also ex
pressed his gratification over the fact
that a Proctor day had been inaugu
rated.
A general discussion followed, and
ways and means of organizing Proctor
day upon a permanent basis were con
sidered. The opinion prevailed that a
permanent and self perpetuating body
should be formed for conducting the
celebration from year to year, with au
thority to appoint committees to assist
as occasion might require.
It is understood, although it was not
finally settled, that the celebration this
year should be held Saturday, July 8.
There was some discussion as to the
practicability of having, ttu^^^aiion
so near to the Fourth July, but this
was regarded as a matter which could
be determined after more considera
tion.
The question of financing the holiday
also came up for discussion, and the
opinion prevailed that the celebration
should not be of a character requiring
a heavy expense. It was agreed that
there should be bands, speaking and a
few attractions in the parks, but that
the aim should be to make the occasion
as much of a home affair as possible,
where the people of the city could
come together in pleasant recreation
and amusement. As a mode of raising
the little money required it was sug
gested by Mr. Maher, and the sugges
tion was generally approved, that
small receptacles should be placed in
the stores and factories of the city,
into which the people might deposit
whatever amounts they choose to de
fray the expenses. It was suggested
that the receptacles should bear the
following inscription:
PROCTOR DAY.

PHONE INTRODUCTION
Theater Party Culminates In
Bachelor Girl's Marriage.
Boston.Whatever may be the status
of the telephone introduction in books
of etiquetteformal, informal or dis
tinctly bohemianit has led to at least
one recent betrothal and marriage in
high social circles. Recently Alfred
Borden, son of Mr. and Mrs. Spencer
Borden of Fall River, was content with
his bachelorhood.
That was before he had heard over
the wire the sweet voice of Miss Susan
B. Ellis of Surrey, England.
He came to hear it in this way: One
night he had "called up" from his
father's cotton mills his friend, Mrs.
Humphreys, and asked her to go with
him to a theater. Mrs. Humphreys bad
a headache, or a previous engagement
or something of equal importance, and
couldn't go.
It was a pity, though, to leave Mr.
Borden a prey to the ennui of a lonely
bachelor evening, and then the seats
too! Mrs. Humphreys would do her
best to fix it
Not many moments later Mr. Borden
was being introduced through the re
ceiver to Mrs. Humphreys' sister. Miss
Ellis, whom Mr. Borden had. strangely
enough, never met in spite of her suc
cess as "the bachelor girl" of South
ampton, N. Y.. last summer.
To make a long story short. Miss
Ellis and Mr. Borden went to the thea
ter, taking Cupid along as a supercargo
in the taxi. The little fellow did the
work well. Only a few weeks later
their engagement was announced, and
the couple were married in the chapel
of St. George's church, atuyvesant
square. New York.
The bride's father was present, hav
ing come over from England for the
ceremony. After their wedding trip
Mr. and Mrs. Borden will live at Short

Thirty-two years ago, when he was

total assets were 50 cents and the con

arrival he was 50 cents poorer.
"When I got off a train in Minne
apolis all I had to direct me was a
card bearing the address of a cousin
who had come to America a short
time before," Mr. Nelson said. "I
showed the card to a hackman. who
also was Swedish. He took my 50
cents and drove me a few blocks,
pointing to one of the windows,
marked 444, said. 'There it is.' I had
supposed that the 'box 444' written on
the card was a street address. I did
not know how my cousin was to ap
pear from that box, but I stood with
eyes glued on the number from 10
o'clock in the morning until the middle
of the afternoon, afraid to look else
where for fear my cousin would come
in the meantime.

"It is especially gratifying to me to
learn that Major Charles Young, Tenth
United States cavalry, is to receive
this recognition, for his services in Li
beria have been of a high order. His
service there has received the highest
commendation from the president and
secretary of state of Liberia, as well as
from our own secretary of state and
our charge d'affaires at Monrovia. I
have directed the commanding general,
eastern department to designate an
officer to represent the war department
on the occasion."
Major General Leonard Wood writes:
"I appreciate very much the good

this work because of his special quali

It is a great satisfaction to know he
has so fully met the requirements of
that difficult situation. His service in
in the army has been highly creditable'
to his race from every standpoint, and
I beg you to transmit to him my sin
cere congratulations on the good work
which he has accomplished and the
well earned recognition which he has'
received."
