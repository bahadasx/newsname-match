George Washington.
(By Jessie McConchie)
George Washington was the greatest
man in American history. He led our
country through the Revolutionary war
and later was unanimuosly elected presi
dent of the United States in which ca
pacity he served two successive terms.
The Washington family lived in tho
woods of Virginia when this country still
belonged to England. The Washing-
tons were of English descent as were
most of the people living in America at
that time. George's oldest brother
was named Lawrence and he was very
fond of his little brother who was born
February 22, 1732.
George was always known to be hon
est when even a boy and his play-matej
frequently came to him for settlement
of their disputes.
There are many stories told of Wash
ington's boyhood. The story of the
cherry tree is familiar to every one.
Also the story of riding hi3 mother's
favorite horse to death. During thc
French and - Indian wars. Washington
wa3 next in command under- Braddock.
His knowledge of the country was much.
greater than that of the Englishman's,
who knew little or nothing of the In
dian country.
After the French and Indian war was
over he retired to his home where ho
married Martha Curtis, who had two
children of whom Washington was very
fond. He never had any children of
his own.
When the colonies revolted against
England in 1775, Washington was elec
ted to the position of commander in
chief of the Continental army. Wash
ington's army consisted of men who
were untrained and had never seen sei
vice except in the French and Indian
war. But when their country called
even old men responded.
He led his army through the sever:
terrible years of the war, onto victory .
And at the end was richly rewarded.
After serving his two terms a3 presi
dent he retired to his' home at Mount
Vernon where he lived until his death
in 1799, at the age of 67 years.
Every American feels that George
Washington was the greatest and brav
est man who ever lived and as long as
men live he will be looked up to. Peo
ple even take their hats off to his pic
ture and statue.
