Mil. P AliKER'.i BEST SPEECH,
Theeffnit was (lie best potiueal
speech of Mr. Parket'« career,
tie had intended to make only a
five minute talk, but under pies
sure of an enthusiastic crowd of
tivo bundled Thirteenth warders,
be expanded into a masterly cam
gaign addicts Kuo blended
with humility ami t In* masteiful
voice ot leadership wii h i he spirit
of Democ racy In delivery It was
peifeet The audience, respon
sive from the outset, was swept
into the wildest enthusiasm at
each successive period. While
Mr. Parker al ways has beeu reo
nghized as a splendid speaker,
his rapid Improvement, through
stump experience is a source of
keenest delight to his followers.
The excoriation of Mr. Ewing
and Col. Pleasant was the high
note of Parker's speech, but he
also touched upon his policies
and plans. The short ballot, Ins
idea for a coustilutional conven
tion, non partisan elections, aboli
tion of sinecures and his pledge
to give the state an efficient, bust
ness admimst i at inn, he dwelt
upon In some detail. Then he
spoke of the progress of his cam
paign and his coutidetice in sue
cess. He stressed the insistence
ot himself ami his friends upon a
square deal at the polls in April.
RULE OF THE PEOPLE.
"Democracy means the role of
the people/' Mr. Parker said in
opening "When absolute con
trol of public affairs is vested in
one man, it ceases to be Demo
cracy;
"I had the privilege of speak
ing in this hall four years ago
At, that time the man who bad
turned on bis fellow ward bosses
came out daily iu bis papers say
ihg his candidate was sweeping
Louisiana. Ynu kuow how much
sweeping was done election day
"You know, too, how after this
man was elected national eominit
teemao, elected by Luther E.
Hall at the request and solicita
tion of D'Une! D Moore, editor of
the Times-Picayune, that he weot
back on these men and on the
forces of reform who had a right
to expect that be would stand by
them.
"That man today aspires to be
chief boss of Louisiana He bas
not hesitated to use the columns
of bis newspapers to villlfy men
wbo oppose him. I atu here to
say that never under any condi
tion do I propose to bow my neck
and kneel at the feet of Robert
Ewing, boas of the Tenth ward."
Mr. Parker continued, making
the statement quoted above
Then he said that, although he
had fought the ward boss system
for years, the leaders personally
were his frienee, and he had never
indulged in personalities. Even
after the States had attacked him
be remained silent, he said, "until
they went to the end of the rope
and then I pulled the rope."—

On motion of Mr. Walet, sac

ried, the reading of the minuta*
of the previous meeting was dis
pensed with.
A discussion of the shameful
attack perpetrated on Mica Cora
Itcggio, one of this Hoard's most

severe condemnation from every

Whereupon, Dr. U. 8. Perret
introduced and moved the adop

Whereas, the Iberia Pariah

I'atontville flobool, for their an
warranted entry into tire said
nehool, thereby creating a grata
disturbance within the aaid
school; Mra LeBlanc committing
the additional unheard of and na.
speakable offense of asaaalting
Miss Cora lleggio, (be worthy and
respected principal of that acbool,
while Mr. LeBlano, the husband
of the assailant, atood by la

First Ward, and the District At

beendniy seconded by Mr. Ulysse

Tbere being no farther busi
ness, the Board adjourned.

RAISING BABY

FIKHT PBKIUNG
Granting that baby chirks
have been well hatched, the tpies
tionof feeding them comes up
Much depends upon the inlelli
gent handling of tliiR problem.
After hatching, the chicks
should be disturbed as litt e tis
possible Give them « good rest
to gain strength, either under the
old fowl or In die incubator or
darkened brooder. Don't give
any food whatsoever for the lirsi
48 huurs, as Ibe last promu of
batching is the absorption of the
yolk of the egg This provides
plenty of food for the chick ft r
the first 48 hours and the addi
tion of any food would seriously
Interfere with the working« of the
digestive organs; A few hours Im
fore feeding, give them some Hue
grit to pick at and a drink of wii
ter with the chill taken off.
DON'T aiVB nAHV Onil'KS HEAVY
GRAIN.
For the first food, it is very ad
vieable to secore a prepared baby
ohiek food. This should be a
starting food and not a heavy
grain. The advisability of these
preparrd starting foods is that
they contain tbe nec saury food
elements that quickly build bone,
flesh and feathers, Him« alno
contain ingredients that help the
delicate digestive orgsns of the
baby chicks and so help to keep
off tbe chick diseases that usual
ly are fatal.
Oatmeal, rolled oats, cracked
grain mixtures, johnny cake,
bread crumbs, haul boiled eggs,
and graiiLtnashes are need In vn
riona ways in feeding the baby
chick. Whatever the feed nsed,
be very oarefnl about feeding too
much. If a mash is fed, moisten
it only slightly. Five or six
feeds a day are about right for
Ibe Drat two weeks Never allow
moist feed to lie about. Feed it
in a olesn way. After the first
few day*, a little finely cracked
gram can be sprinkled ou tbe
floor as this makes them work for
a living.
A little animal food aids in the
rapid growth of tbe chick. Milk
In its varions forme is excellent
for them. Boar milk and butter
milk are very good, but these are
not needed it atatting food with
dry buttermilk in it is used
When feeding milk, do not switob
from tbe aweet to tbe sonr aa tbia
will «suae digestive troubles.
•■H TEAT FOOD 18 WH0LU80MB.
Carefully examine all feed to
sea that It la free from mould or
nat, or tba beef scrap from
tmnt. Haver faed anything that
ia In any way spoiled. Careless,
naaa about the feed may result In
mnoh damage in a very short
time.
Wheat bren (dry) is of'en used
to a very good advantage.
Oh lake may have access 10 tbia
at all time« of tbe day and it will
not intarfera with the regular
faeding.
KEEP CHICKS URIGHt.
