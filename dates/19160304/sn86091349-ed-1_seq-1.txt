C. W. Van Law of Bostcn, ylre-'1

Mn Van Law emphasized hist
statement that It was not positive

was behind the activity but tha(j

is very; apparent and the ase of sU

. If the nations decide to return to
a bimetallc basis, then the d emand
for silver would be enormously In
creased. ti would be a wise move on the)
part of the United States govern

DELEGATES TO CHICAGO
The Republican State Central com
mittee met at Reno last Saturday
and after attending to preliminary
matters resolved itself into a con
vention and selected the following as
delegates to the national conven
tion to be held at Chicago next June.
Hugh Brown of Nye; William N.
McGill, of White Pine; II. G. Humph
! ey. of Washoe; Samuel Piatt of
Orinsby; George' S. Williams, ofi
Churchill; MeI S. Bad of Elko.
The alternate delegates are: W.

Monan, of Washoe: William Fastnn
of Eureka; H. i U. Castle, of Elko;
J. P. Bradley, of Esmeralda; Fetefl
Buol. of Clark.
The question has been asked: How
was it that congressman Roberts was
overlooked. Possibly it ,wa8 an
oversight, or that two representa,
tives from Grmsby county was too
many from the same county. But
th.i$t was probably not the reason,
either;, sincfe Washoe. Churchill and
Elko were given two apiece. How
ever, the delegation is a good one.

Big extra and Increased dividend
payments by various copper com
