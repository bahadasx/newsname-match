ERIE LICENSES GRATED.
I Erie, March 3 —The applications
lof former license holders were
' granted today in the license court
with the exception of one, which
was taken under advisement. Only
one out of 22 new applications was
granted. There were 226 applica
tions in all.
i morbid German philosophy has
; greatly influenced certain intellec
tual circles in all countries. Many
of the persons whose minds have
, been thus contaminated are actu
ally dangerous to their own races
because they have lost all patriot-
I ism.
"The allied nations should un
ite in a crusade against everything
| that is German after the war. A
lasting and general boy c o 11
against all German products is
| sure, but this is not sufficient. The
; German' language and literature
i must be driven from all civilized
parts of the world. That alone
will rid civilization of the un
healthy and dangerous influence
of the Bodies. If all commercial
ami mental intercourse with them
is broken off they will be no long
er able to do any harm.
"When the terms of peace are
dictated the Allies will, of course,
restrict, the territory in which the
: Huns are allowed to live as much
fis possible.
"After their complete isolation
the Germans will become a dying
nation. They will not be able to
I exist on their soil without foreign
commerce. The process of their
starvation may be slow; it is pos
sible that they manage to struggle
along for a century or even longer
as miserable outcasts, but for the
world at large they will be dead
-as soon as the war ends."

sible to say who will win. He
spoke in this city last night.
