measure that conformed ti
organic laws of tin- stati

finally done it was an eas\
ter for Louisville to prepari
adopt an ordinance on thi
jeet. Pntli cities had previou
suffered from the heavy ininiigra
tion of negroes from the South,
who crowded into many residen
tial sections previously occupied
by the white alone, crowding out
the latter and sending down the
value of property in that section.
St. I. unis had a ii even more diffi
cult fight to make against a very
stron«; opposition. The mayor
and city government is Republi
can. and they refused to pass the
ominance asked for by so many
persons. It tnus became neces
sary to appeal to the initiative
provision of the Missouri consti
tution which allows the voters to
submit t v ji-itior. an ylaw they j
desire to the popular vote. The
city government fought the pro- 1
posed ordinances, and so did the ,
press, almost unanimously, al-'

population injured the value of
real estate; but protesting that
an v legislation of this kind would
prejudice St. Louis in the neigh- !
J boring districts with which it does
I most of its business- Illinois,
Iowa and Kansas—where there is
no race distinction of any kind
and no color line is drawn. The
general view of the question is
! resented as follows by the Cllobe- 1
Democrat, a Republican paper
which opposed the ordinances
while recognizing the strength of ;
race prejudice :
The segregation ordinances are
founded upon race prejudice.
That such prejudice exists cannot
be denied. There is something
instinctive in racial antagonisms,
stronger as to some races than as
to others, but strongest between
races having the least physical re
semblance. America is made up
of people of all races, who mingle
in political equality, but who are
nonetheless socially separated by
various divisions growing out of
racial aversions or antipathies.
Time brings here amalgamation [
of all branches of the white race, j
but there is litle or no fusion of
that with the red, the yellow or,
the black races, nor is it likely
there will ever be. for nature her
self seems to have raised barriers
that no laws can throw down. It
is useless, therefore, to deny the
existence of these prejudices or
the consequences of them. It is
nonsense, for example, to say
that the entry of colored residents
into a block occupied by whites
does not cause a depreciation of
property values in that block, for
the evidences of such results are !
too conspicuous to be denied. •

between the whites and blacks,
and a large force of police was on
duty at the polls; b t. on the con
trary, it was one of the quietest
elections ever held in St. Louis.
Some of the negro leaders talk
of taking the matter to court, but
as the question has already been
thoroughly aired in coi rts in the
case of I>a 1 1 iniorc. ;iii,| it has been
determined just how far a com

regation. a suit is impossible, as
the only effect of siieh litigation,
if it is ever iustifuted. which is
greatly to be doubted, w il i >e to
furnish fees for lawyers:
The separation or segregation
of the races prevails generally
throughout the South. Loiiisiami
having to a large degree inaugu
rated it with the regulation of
travel on cars, boats, and in pub
lic places. It has caused no
special injury to anyone ; the law
has been enforced with far great
er ease than expected, and it has
unquestionably tended to prevent
friction between the races when
traveling, which of old frequent
ly developed into serious disturb
ances and what were called "race
riots." '— T i m es- 1 'i c a v u ne .

THE CORONER.
Now that the time has about ar- J
rived when it Will be encumbent
upon every voter i 11 the Parish to j
soon express his choice as to j
whom will fill the office of Coro
ner of our Parish, we present to
our readers the candidacy of Dr.
J. W. K. Shaw for re-election.
The position of Coroner is one
which requires, not only skill, but
a determination to lend every as
sistance to the District Attorney
in furnishing evidence uneu
crimes are committed, and Iberia
Parish has never had a more con
scientious Coroner since the Par
ish was created. Dr. Shaw is al
ways on his job and never flinches
when it comes to doing his duty
by the people in times when he is
needed most. He is a native of
this Parish and lias lent every as
sistance possible for our advance
ment along educational and indus
trial lines of endeavor. He needs
no introduction to the people of
the Parish at our hands, and if
meritorious services count for
anything we feel certain his elec
tion Is assured. The question of
party affiliation should count but
little when it comes to selecting
officials who have done their duty
and by virtue of his experience in
filling this office, the voters of i • -
ria would make a serious mistake
in not again honoring him with
their franchise.
A SPECIFIC AGAINST COLDS.
The nearest thing to a specilc against
colds is a sleeping porch or open bed
room and a cold soonge bath eve' y
morning when you first get up. Ev«>n
then you will occasionally take a coM,
especially when colds are epidemic, and
when yo ado you will find Chamberlain •
Cough Remedy a great help in enabling
you to get rid of it. Try it. Obtain a bis
everywhere.

The Democracy

intended to signify the neginuing
of t lie polit ical act i \ i i > w li i.-ii is
to agitate the state in the eoiiten
tiou against .lohn AI. Parker, the
candidate lor governor oi the
Progressive party. An inten .st
ing campaign ma} be anticipated,
but. singular as ii uia\ seem, .Mi'.
Parker, it lie has been reported
correctly, will give little atten
tion to North Louisiana. His
Canvass L to be confined to the
congressional districts where In
has assumed he may secure this
advantage that will be denied
him in the fourth and fifth eon
giessional districts.
North Louisiana has always
been solidly Democratic. It was
North Louisiana which redeemed
the state from Republican spolia
tion.
It may be conceded that -Mr.
Parker will carry the third con
gressional district, but it is not
believed that he will be as fortu
nate nùthe other, congressional
districts of the State. Indeed, it
is always forecast by a majority
which at this time is indefinite.
It is frequently suggested that
two white men's parties «r» med
ed in Louisiana in order to con
serve the political equilibrium
and to promote an alignment ot
the parties that would result in
securing the best and most avail
able men for officers, but the time
is not yet for such a movement.
The experience of radicalism and
the era of reconstruction is vet
t<»o° vividly impressed on the Obi
Guard, and until these have passed
away from the activities of life,
there will remain almost solidly

Why dilate on 1 lie amusing con

influence with the thinking publie
is almost nil. This was proved in
two instances durinir the last six
months. First when the v siip

when thev gave their alleged in

people voted exactly opposite to
the ponderous advice printed in
hundred of columns by these
papers. Southern Vindicator.
