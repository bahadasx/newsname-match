CREATEST OCEAN DISASTER
TITANIC'S TOLL
IS EXCEEDED
BU500UVES
No Signs of Submarine Before
or After Sinking of
Cruiser.
WAS TRANSPORTING
MEN TO SALONIKI
French Minister of Marine Kept
the Loss a Secret Since
February 26.
Paris, March ~The greatest
ocean disaster in modern times was
disclosed today when the French min
inslry of marine announced that there
were nearly 4,000 men on hoard the
French auxiliary cruiser, Province,
wheli she was sunk in ihe Mediter­
ranean on February 26. A previous
statement said ahout. 870 men had
been saved, indicating that upward of
live.s were lost.
It was slated that, on hoard the
Province were the staff of the Third
Colonial infantry regiments, the
Third battalion, the Second company
of the First battalion, Jfce Second, ma­
chine gun company and one extra
company, in all nearly 4,000 men.
lTp to the present, the largest num­
ber of lives ever lost in one wreck
was when the White Star liner, Ti­
tanic, struck an iceberg off the New­
foundland banks on April 4, 1912, and
sank, with a death loss of J,59".. The
rescued numbered 743.
Kept Loss Secret.
The French minister of marine had
previously issued no statement, as ul
the number of persons on the Pro­
vince when sho went down, The ves­
sel, however, when within the trans
Atlantic service, could carry
persons, including the crew, and il:
lias been presumed that as she was
transporting troops between ports not
far apart she was carrying a number
of men larger than her normal ca­
pacity.
The official stalement issued Febru­
ary 29, announcing the sinking of the
sinking of the Province, said:
Sank February 26.
"The iFrench auxiliary cruiser, Pro­
vince, engaged in transporting troops
to Salonika, was sunk in the Medi­
terranean on February 2G. Two hun­
dred and ninety-six surxivors have
been brought to Malta and about 400
to Melos by British and French patrol
vessels summoned by wireless.
"No signs of a submarine were no­
ticed, either before or after the sink­
ing. The Province was armed with
five cannon of 14 centimeters, two of
57 milimeters and four of 47 milimet
ers."
Details Lacking.
Details of the Provence's sinking
are not available. 'No further offi­
cial statement has been issued and
unofficial sources have no definite in­
formation as to the manner in which
the vessel, met disaster—whether by
torpedo, mine or internal explosion.
Although in actual number of lives
lost, the sinking of the Provence is
the greatest marine calamity of years
it cannot be compared to the loss of
large passenger liners, where, in
many instances, a majority of the
victims were women and children.
The purely military nature of the
(Provence and the general calmness
with which the French have viewed
large military losses will mitigate the
effect of the disaster, which, when
compared with losses in many en­
gagements, does not appear so for­
midable.
It has, for instance, very little of
the tragic element that attended the
sinking of the iCunard Line steam­
ship, Lusitania, which was torpedoed
by a German submarine and sunk off
the head of Kinsale, Ireland, on May
T. 1015, with the loss of 12$$ lives.
NEGRO SHOT DOWN.

BREWERS ARE
Charged With Violating Corrupt
Practices Act One Hundred
Under Indictment.
SAID THEY TAMPERED
WITH ELECTIONS
iPillsburg, Pa., March —One hun­
dred and one .indictments against Iff)
brewing companies located in various
parts of Pennsylvania and the United
States Brewers' association of New
York were unexpectedly returned late
today by the federal grand jury,
which has been investigating the al­
leged political activity of brewers.
The indictments, which are the first
returned since the investigation open­
ed, charged the brewing companies
and the association with conspiracy
in the alleged unlawful expenditure
of money in elections at. which votes
for federal officials were being cast.
The indictments make no mention
of individuals, but are directed aL
corporations themselves. Fifty-eight
of the cotnpanies named are members
of the Pennsylvania Brewers' associ­
ation, while 42 are members of the
United States Brewers' association.
Little is said in the indictments
regarding the specific" offensives al­
leged under section 83 of the Federal
Penal Code, the so-called corrupt
practices act, and section 37 of the
same Code, under the sections, fines
not exceeding $5,0-00 in the first case
and $10,000 in the second, may be ob­
tained.

WELCOME PEACE
Chief Exective Arrived in Capital
City Last Night From Euro­
pean Trip.
"U. S. MUST LEAD THE
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS"
Governor Hanna Gives Graphic
Picture of Conditions in War­
ring Countries.
"I am glad to be home," said Gover­
nor L. B. Hanna, who arrived'in the
capital city on No. 1 last night.
"While away my time has been
spent in Norway, Denmarck, Ger­
many and Holland.
"Their viewpoint of the war and
conditions generally is different than
ours.
"Each of the so-called neutral coun­
tries is trying its best to preserve its
neutrality. Not an easy thing to do
when surrounded by warlike neigh­
bors like Germany, France, England
and Russia.
"Holland has its colonies in the
Fast indies, of great value, that she
might, lose over night if she were
drawn into the war.
"Norway, Sweden and Denmark
each have their reasons for preserv­
ing a strict neutrality, and yet know­
ing that at any time they may become
involved.
"In all of the neutral countries
their, armies are on a* footing'.
The" Increase in the cost of govern­
ment in every country, neutral and
belligerent, has been enormous. As
an example, take the country of Den­
mark. In times of peace its govern­
ment costs about 130,000,000 kroners
per year. Now. while Denmark is
not at war with any nation, yet, with
her army mobilized and with other
expenses caused by the war, it is
costing Denmark 2.10,000,00 to 300,000,
000 kroners per year to maintain her
government. An enormous burden to
lie paid by a nation of less than
I!,lion,000 people. That which is true
of Denmark is true as to the other
neutral countries, and is true in a
much larger degree in the belligerent
countries. There is a strong under­
current in the countries visited for
peace.
Europe Wants Peace.
"The neutral countries each seem
to feel that they are not big or strong
enough to lead the way, or that the
,impression might, obtain that they
might seem to favor one side or Ihe
other.
"They wish Ihe- United Stales to
take the lead. In Germany the
thought seems to be that any belliger­
ent country that, might take the lead
in a peace movement, that such a
step would be taken by the world as
an evidence of weakness on the part
of the nation making the first pro­
posal.
"Germany is being blockaded on the
sea by England, and of some things,
especially milk, there is a scarcity,
but on the whole Germany has plenty
of food for all, except for the babies.
Central Europe is open to her from
the North Sea to Turkey. While in
Germany I
visited war hospitals, civil­
ian detention camps and camps of
war prisoners. They were well tak­
en care of, clean and plenty of whole­
some food. The prisoners are weigh­
ed each week and the records show
that they have gained in weight.
German Lignite Mines.
"While in Germany I spent two
days in investigating the coal bri
quetting industry. Germany has lig­
nite coal of the same character and
quality as ours. They burn lignite
briquettes in their railroad engines,
in power plants, in hotels, barracks,
prison camps, in the private homes,
in fact, everywhere.
"North Dakota must briquette and
use her lignite coal and save and
keep in the state the four millions of
dollars that we now send out annual­
ly for Eastern coal. I shall take this
lignite briquetting coal proposition up
with Dean Babcock of the state uni­
versity and with him formulate some
plan to lay before our state legislat­
ure next winter. I have strong faith
that we can solve the coal problem
for North Dakota and the Northwest
and develop pur greatest natural re­
source.
"I was advised by several whom I
met from Belgium that conditions
there have improved very much. Eng­
land has been generous in giving a
large stated sum each month for Bel­
gian relief. Most of the Belgians who
fled into Holland have returned to
their homes. Some 26,000 are still in­
terned, however, in Holland and are
being supported by the Dutch govern-

Teutons.
BRITISH RETAKE POSITIONS
ABOUT THE YPRES REGION
Bombardments Along the West
Front Are of a Violent
Character.
TURKEY WANTS PEACE.
London, March 4.—The morn
ing newspaper feature dispatch­
es from Athens, which declare
that agitation in Constantinople
in favor of peace is becoming so
pronounced that it would surprise
no one if Turkey suddenly capit­
ulated to the Entente allies. It
is reported also that Rachmi Bey,
governor of the Vilayet of Smyr­
na, is trying to arrange separate
peace terms with the Entente
allies.
London. March 3.—Around the vil­
lage of Donaumont, which is in the
hands of the Germans, is raging a
battle of great intensiiy. Having cap­
tured the village and extended their
lines west and south, the Germans
were forced to give ground before
vicious attacks of the French, who
regained parts of the territory they
had lost. The fight i::- here is pro­
ceeding unabated.
French Hard Presed.
From the regio-i A Mallencourt,
'.I*®-- Woevra
region, east of Verdun, the bombard­
ments are of a violent, character, the
Germans endeavoring to force their
way closer to the fortress of Verdun,
and the French tenaciously striving
to hold them back. Several assem­
bling points of ihe Germans have
been vigorously shelled by the
French, especially in the vicinity of
Beaumont.
Recaptured Positions.
The Germans admit that in the re­
gion of Ypres, the British recaptured
the positions the (lermans took from
them February II, but say the Brit­
ish were immcdiatelv driven out of
most of them.
The
I'ritish, however,
declared they had i•onsolidaled these
positions.
An official communication from the
Turkish army headquarters says the
•asl and west coasi districts of Adei:
have come under Ottoman rule, as
Ihe result of the submission of the
tribesmen. The Turks also report a
defeat recently of ho British near
Dalinch, in the neighborhood of Aden,
but the Rrilish nllicial press bureau
denies that an eiii'iu'einenl. took place
here.
The' mystery of how 500 Germans
of the 24th Brandenburg regiment
have been uhle to iioi out a week in
the ruined fort, liouamont', against
the attacks of the French, says Ihe
Petit Journny, probably may be ex­
plained by their having extended Ihe
subterranean passages of the fort and
established commit'.'ie.ition with their
advanced lines.
SIDI BARANI OCCUPIED.
Cairo, Egypt, Alarch 3.—Sidi Bar
ani, a town in western Egypt, was re
occupied without opposition by Brit­
ish forces yesterday, after being for
three months in the hands of tribes­
men commanded by Turkish officers.
Further information indicates that
the Turkish casualties on February
26 were heavy.
Among the prisoners were Casfar
Pasha, the second in command, and
Xehad Bey and about 30 others.
The British casualties included two
officers killed and six wounded.
BITLIS CAPTURED.
Petrograd, March 3.—It is officially
announced that the Russians last
night captured Bitlis, Turkish Arme­
nia. about 110 miles southeast of Er

ONLY FIFTEEN SHIPS
IN ACM SERVICE
Washington, March 3.—Only 15 of
the 21 battleships of the Atlantic fleet
are on active duty in West Indian
waters, three of the other six being
so crippled for lack of officers and
men that they cannot operate with
the fleet, and the other three are
either awaiting or undergoing exten­
sive repairs.
The 15 active ships are short from
eight to 17 officers each of the num­
ber assigned to them by the navy de­
partment and 1,000 coal passers, elec­
tricians, gunners mates and other
trained enlisted men, although they
have added about 100 more men than
the personnel allowed by regulations.
This was the situation of the fleet as
pictured today by Admiral Fletcher,
commander-in-chief, before the house
naval commission. He added that in
his opinion, and that of various
boards of officers who have studied
the subject, the battleship squadron
of the fleet" required at least 5,000
additional men over the complement
now assigned.

A Starch Verdict.
There were free expressions of
opinion that the senate's action, be­
cause ihe vote actually was taken on
a motion to table the Gore resolution
with a correction by the author and a
substitute by Senator iMcCumb.er, was
in effect a "starch verdict" and had
nol actually accomplished the pur­
pose of the president.
Such statements aroused the pres­
ident's friends, who feared they would
produce an effect, exactly opposite to
that intended, a notice to the world
that, the senate stands behind the
president in his demands on Germany
for the rights of Americans traveling
Ihe seas.
House Ready to Comply.
In the house, however, the foreign
affairs committee, by a vote 17 to
2. look a longer step toward meeting
fully the president's wishes. It voted
to report the ATcLemore warning res­
olution with the recommendation that
it be tabled.
In the report, the committee as­
serts that the constitution imposed
the conduct of diplomatic negotia­
tions on the president and "with this
practice the committee does not feel
it proper for the house of represent­
atives to interfere."
It probably will be voted on in the
house tomorrow under a special rule.
Administration forces are confident
of a full-fledged victory.
White House Satisfied.
At the White House satisfaction
was expressed with the senate's ac­
tion.
Senator Gore voted for the motion
to table, and declared he considered
the administration's victory a mixed
one.
The debate which followed the sen­
ate's vote was sensational.
Senator Lewis, a democrat, plead­
ing with the senators for moderation
in their remarks, declared the Span­
ish war would have been averted by
action in congress similar to that
taken today and that the war was
brought on by vituperative debate.
Senator Clarke, democrat, of Ar­
kansas, who voted with the adminis­
tration forces, declared ttieir actions
did not represent the real sentiments
of the senate.
Fall Scores Action.
Senator Fall, a republican, said:
"By your action today you
have
sent to the kaiser, if you have done
anything, notice that the senate of
the United States will look upon liis
sinking of armed merchant shine and
the deaths of American citisens irob
ably with some degree of regret, but
that no action -would be taken against
him."
Senator Borah, republican, arraign­
ed the senate for what he character­
ized its evasive action.
He said he would "mther have bat­
tleships sunk than to haVe the hoaor
of this senate compromised before
the world."
