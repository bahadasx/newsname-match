Arrested For Robbery.
Two young negroes of this town,
Winnfiield Gardner and Walter
Gasper were arrested last Saturday
for systematically robbing the R.
J. Gary Co Ltd store. One of the
negroes being the shoe-shiner of
the Olivier barbershop, next to the
store, the young negro waited
every day until two of the proprie
tors were at dinner, when he would
go to the store, to buy some small
articles, and every time succeeded
in stealing a pair of pants which
he passed to his accomplice, who
went to St. John and other planta
tions to sell his stolen goods.
Twenty nine pairs of pants and
one coats were found with people
who had bought them from these
young negroes.
Gasper confessed and told how
lie managed to rob the store so
long without being caught, Gard
ner maintain he is innocent.
John Lorins, was also arrested
charged with receiving the stolen
goods. He was released on bail.
COLDS NEED ATTENTION
Internal throat and chest troubles pro
duce inflammation, irritation, swelling
or sorenues and unoless checked at once,
are likely to lead to serious trouble.
Caught in time Dr. Bell's Pine-Tar-Hon
ey loosens the phlegm and destroys the
germs which have settled in the throat
or nose. It is soothing and healing.
Pine is antiseptic; honey is soothing
both together possess excellent medical
qualitieefor fighting cold germs. In

Church Being Improved
A new roof is being placed
F on the Episcopal Church, and
other improvements are being
made to the church, which are
donations from Mr. C. E. Smedes.
This pretty little church was much
in need of repairs. Now if the
grounds were embelished, it would
greatly improved this property
which is nicely located and would
, be an attraction.
