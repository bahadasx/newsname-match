other twelve anti-administration were
all republican. Forty-seven democrats
and twenfy-one republicans voted to
table the Resolution.
Senator Gore voted to table because
he did not favor his own substitute and
Introduced it merely to get an expres
sion of the senate on that issue.
The text of Senator Gore's addition
to his original resolution and which
was tabled with the warning resolution
wafe as follows:
"Resolved, by the senate, the house
of representatives concurring, that
the sinking by a German submarine
without notice or warning of an arm
ed merchant vessel of her public
•nemy, resulting in the death of a citi
zen of the United States, would con
stitute a Just and sufficient cause of
war between the United States and
the German empire."
Several senators explained that the
double form of the question was re
sponsible for the character of the vote
as few senators wanted to vote on the
question regarding a cause for war.
President 'Wilson, after conferring
with Acting Chairman Pou of the rules
committee, determined to have a vote

Senator Jones, republican, declared
the tabling of the resolution had fog

"Nothing has been decided today,
except that the senate of the United

Baid. "We have not passed on the

Sherman Fears War.
"We are approaching the issue of

FIXING
TRAP FOR ENEMY.
Paris, March 8.—The story of the
French sappers who were buried
alive for hours during the battle of
Verdun and who finally dug their way
out to safety, is told In detail by one
of them who arrived in Paris on a
hospital train this morning. He said:
"With my friends, Bernard and
Jean, I was posted in a trench at the
edge of the Vauche woods. The enemy
showed a disposition to attack and,
according to orders, the three of us,
with a charge of powder, fuses and
tools, started down a mine gallery to
fill the mine chamber to lay the wires
and to pack the gAllery behind it. We
did this without difficulty and were
on our way back when a heavy ex
plosion shook us. Had our mine gone
off already? *1 bear stones falling,"
said one of my comrades. We rushed
forward, the gallery was full of grav
el. We realized the horrible truth—
we were walled up. An enemy shell
had exploded above the gallery, caus
ing the roof to fall In.
"We examined the walls in feverish
haste. 'We are done for," said Jean.
We were not afraid of death—it was
all part of the game—but we did not
like to die there in the darkness.
'How long can we stay here?' Jean
asked again. 'There is plenty of air
and the gallery is roomy, but there is
nothing to eat,' I replied. 'Well,
what's the good of a few hours more
or less?' he said. 'Why wait? I for
one have already made up my mind.'
He took out his revolver but I stop-
we may nit on some
way out.' ... „.
Walt fer OpAnltis.
"The first horror having passed
over, we began to discuss ways and
means. 'Let us wait patiently for our
mine to explode. If it makes a big
enough hole we can dig through Into
it,* I said.
"We sat down in silence and could
hear all the sounds of battle above ns,
for the earth Is a good conductor of
sound. We tried to distinguish the
character of the various vibrations so
as not to miss the noise when our
mine exploded. Finally we heard it
and we rushed forward, through a
wave of hot air. Hope strengthened
our arms and we plied our picks furi
ously but our packing had been so
well done that it took us two hours
before we got into the empty mine
chamber. I listened but the sound of
firing seeiped so far off that I judged
there was a thick layer of earth be
tween us and the outer world. Then
drops fell upon lis. Were we going
to be flooded? 'So much the better,
we shall die more quickly,' said Jean.
Taste Human Blood.
"Something trickled down on my
lips and I recognized the taste. It
was blood, and I realized that if blood
was coming through we could not be
far from the surface. With renewed
hope we set to work again but rather
clumsily, for we started a fall of
earth which nearly buried us. We
were all injured, Bernard's leg beipg
broken, Jean's head cut and my left
arm broken. Despite our pain we
continued our efforts and after a
while we came on a number of dead
bodies of Germans which had rolled
to the bottom of the crater which the
mine explosion had made.
"After an* hour of digging and crawl
ing among these bodies, we got out
into the air. Both my comrades were
so exhausted that they fainted. I
watched over them, being sheltered
from shells and oullets by the steep
side of the crater. After eight hours'
waiting, ambulance attendants found
us and by that time we had but little
life left In us."

WOULDTEML
SEED* USED
Retail Merchants to Give
Luncheon to Farmers
Here Next Week
FARM EXPERT WILL
MAKE AN ADDRESS
Will Launch Campaign for
Saving Crop in County
By General Testing
The Ottumwa Retail Merchants'
association means business in the
proposed seed corn campaign about to
be Inaugurated and has made arrange
ments for a big joint meeting of urban
and rural residents Thursday, March
9. A luncheon will be served at this
and a large number of farmers as well
as members of the association are ex
pected to be present.
To assure a good grade of seed for
the next year's corn crop is the pri
mary motive of the retailers who de
sire to assist the farmers insofar as
they art able to protect the corn crop.
The splendid feeling of cooperation
that has prevailed between the local
business men's organization and the
people living in the rural districts has
been manifested at different times and
never more pronounced than on the
occasion of the recent annual banquet.
Will Work Together.
This spirit of get together was com
mented upon quite favorably and at
some length by Governor George W.
Clarke who praised both farmer and
merchant, for the excellent condition
a# found heM).'It is in keeping with
this cooperation spirit that the Retail
Merchants' association has taken up
the seed corn problem. The body offers
to be of any help it can to the farmers
of the community in striving to have
only the best seed corn /used for the
1916 crop.
Realizing the character of last
year's crop and the great possibility of
poor seed from it, the association has
set out to be of service to the agricul
tural interests and is working tp the
end that all of the corn in the county
be tested and the per cent of seed suit
able for use determined before plant
ing time.
The big meeting called for next
Thursday at the rooms of the associa
tion will be featured by the presence
of an expert from the state agricul
tural college at Ames who will address
the gathering. An explanation of the
condition of the seed corn and the
need for testing will be made at this
luncheon and a good attendance of the
farmers is expected. If the retailers
can prevent it,,there will be no poor
corn this year and only the best seed
obtainable will be used for they argue
that what is good for the farmer is
good for the community and have en
tered into the campaign with a will.
