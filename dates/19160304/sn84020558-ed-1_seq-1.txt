Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Around the village of Douaumont,
which Is in the hands of the lier
inans, is raging a battle of great in
tensity. Having captured the vil
lage and extended their lines west
and south, the Germans were forced
to give ground before vicious at
tacks of the French who regained
part of the territory they had lost.
The fighting here is proceeding un
abated. From the region of Malancourt,
west of the Meuse, to the Woevre
region, east of Verdun, the bombard
ments are of a violent character,
the Germans endeavoring to force
their way closer to the fortress of
Verdun and the French tenaciously
striving to hold them back. Several
assembling points of the Germans
have been vigorously shelled by the
French, especially in the vicinity of
Beaumont. The Germans admit that
in the region of Ypres the British
recaptured the positions the Ger
mans took from them February 14,
but say the British were immediately
driven out of most of them. The
British, however, declared that they
have consolidated these positions.
There has been considerable ar-
tillery activity in the Argonna tor-
-st and in upper Alsace an infan-
try engagement in which elements
of German trenches were taken by
11 comparative quiet prevails on the
Russian front. Along the line in
the Alps and on the Isonzo river
sector the Austrians and Italians
continue their bombardments and at-
tacks at
try, but
various points by infan-
without materially chang-1
Sng their positions.
The Russians have captured the
important town of Bitlis In the Lake
Van district of Turkish Armenia,
and elsewhere in the Caucasus re
gion and in Persia are keeping up
their vigorous offensive against Ot
toman forces.
An official communication from
the Turkish army headquarters says
the east and west coast districts
of Aden have come under Otto
man rule as the result of the sub
mission of the tribesmen. The Turks
also report defeat recently of the
irliish near Dafiuch in the neigh
borhood of Aden, but the British
official press bureau denies that an
eneatrement took place here.
The British have reoccupied Sidi i
Jfarani in western Egypt which had
been in the hands of Senussi tribes
men commander by Turkish offi
cers. The town was occupied with
out resistance.
A German seaplane has been cap
titred off the Belgian coast while
returning from England. One of its
occupants had been drowned. The
other was taken prisoner. It is
thought probable this craft is the
one that had bombarded the south
east 'coast of Englund Wednesday
night.

BERLIN, (by wireless to Sayville),
March 3. The capture of the town

Germans Believe Verdun

Republican A. P. Leased Win-
PARKS, March 3. While it appears
certain that Verdun remains the prin
cipal objective of the Germans, their
offensive is full of possibilities which
will be revealed as the great batle
progresses.
The region of Douaumont, which
comprises three positions the village,
the radoubt and the fort again was
the center of a fierce German attack
today. The combat continues about
this region. The fact that the Ger
mans succeeded in entering the vil
lage is considerd by military observ
ers only as a fluctuation in the tide
of battle that is likely to occur dur
ing any important action.
A concentrated fire of the French
guns in the Woevre has forestalled a
contemplated sortie on the part of the
Germans. In following the present
developments the military observers
discuss the possibility of an attack
on the right bank of the Meuse by
the Germans and question whether
the Germans will devote more atten

the extreme French right. These are
among the mysteries of the action.
It becomes evident that the. Ger
mans in the battle lasting from the
21st to the 26th of February used
only part of their forces. Although
they had put jn line seven army corps
there must have been an imperative
reaon for thus dividing their forces,
and it is attributed to the lack of
space, the sector which was the
scene of the furious cmmbals being
extremely small not more than ten
kilometers long.
There is also speculation as to the
duration of the battle. Comparison
of the fighting around Verdun is be
ins made with the fights on the
Isonzo and at Czernowitz, each of
which lasted about a month. The
battle at Czernowitz is considered as
particularly comparable with that at
Verdun, it having been on a limited
front and consisting of a. series of ex
tremely vigorous frorttal attacks, sep
arated by pauses.

STILL CHANCE
FOR SETTLEMENT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, March 3. After hope
had been abandoned today of reaching
an agreement on the wage increases
asked by the I'nited Mine Workers in
negotiations over a new contract for
the soft coal fields of the middle west,
the situation took a slightly favorable
turn and tonight both operators and
miners said there still was a chance of
reaching a settlement.
The miners will meet early tomorrow
and it is expected they will present fig
ures relating to dead work and yard
are on the mine run basis which may
ease the situation. If they do not
agree, a sine die adjournment will re
sult and each of the four states in
volved will try to make wage contracts
by districts, something which both
sides have tried to avoid, it is said.
The miners today cut down their
demand for a ten percent increase for
dead work and yardage to five per
cent and also cut the twenty per cent
increase demand for men paid by the
day to 10 per cent. This was rejected
by the operators. The miners voted
down a proposition to cut the tonnage
increase from three cents to two cents
with a corresponding reduction in the
advances asked in the other classes of
work.

HETTY GREEN SELLS
OLD EUREKA MINE
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, March 3. The
purchase from Mrs. Hetty Greeu, the
New Y'ork capitalist, of the "Old Eu
reka" gold mine at Sutter Creek, Cal.,
by a syndicate of eastern millionares
said to have been dickering for the
property for more than three years, was
announced here tonight. The price
was said to have been more than $1.-
000,000 and the deal a spot cash trans
action. Among the purchasers, according to
the announcement, were W. E. Corey,
eastern steel magnate; John D. Rvan
and Tom Cole of the Anaconda group
and Ambrose Monell of the Interna
tional company.
The mine, long known as "Hetty
Green's pet kitten" was operated for a
brief period in the early seventies and
was reputed to have produced $20,
000,000. In 1S77 Mrs. Green closed
the mine down and caused it to be
flooded with 80,000,000 gallons of water.
The explanation for her action given
at the time was that she thought rivals
were attempting to force her to sell it.
Walter Beam, a Denver mining en
gineer arived here today to purchase
machinery to be used in pumping out
the old shafts and tunnels and prepare
for new operations.

Carries Out President's
Wish and Stops Warning

Ships
Republican A. P.. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 3. By a
vote of t;S to 14 the senate today
carried out President Wilson's wish
and killed Senator Gore's resolu
tion to warn American's off armed
belligerent ships.
In a turbulent scene, such as is
seldom witnessed in the senate, vot
ing proceeded with senators shout
ing objections, futilely demanding j
recognition to explain their posi
tions and making iiot retorts to each j
other, all of which were out of or-!
der. At the time so many senators
were shouting for the vice-president's
recognition that the sergeant-at-aims
was called to restore quiet.
After having maneuvered for two
days to get the resolution in surh
preliminary position that it was dis
posed of without debate, the senate
then proceeded to a general discus
sion of the subject which continued
all afternoon to the dismay of admin
istration supporters. There were
free expressions of opinion that the
senate's action, because the vote
actually was taken on a motion to
table the Gore resolution with a
correction by the author and a sub
stitute by Senator McCumber, was
in effect a "Scotch verdict " and had
not actually accomplished the pur
pose of the president. Such state
ments aroused the president's friends
who feared they would produce an
effect exactly opposite to that in
tended, a notice to the world that
the senate stands behind the pres

rights of Americans travel-

In the house, however, the for
W affairs committee by a vote
of 17 to 2 took a longer step to
ward meeting fully the president's
wishes. It voted to report the Mc-
Lemnre warning resolution with the
recommendation that it be tabled.
In the report, the committee as
serts that the constitution imposed
the conduct of diplomatic negotia
tions on the president and "with
this practice the committee does not
feel it proper for the house of rep
resentatives to interfere."

five others with conspiracy to set on
foot a military expedition to encompass
destruction of British property, was
virtually dismissed today when Judge
Maurice T. Dooling, in the I'nited
States district court sustained the de
murrer to the indictment filed by the
consulate's lawyers. There is still an
other indictment against the accused
men on which the court did not rule.
In addition to Bopp those under in

consulate; Charles C. Crowley, de
tective employed by the consulate:
Mrs. Margaret W. Cornell, employed by
Crowley in connection with his work
r the consulate; and J. II. von Kool-
bergen, said to have been hired to
carry out certain alleged bomb plots
in Canada.
The court sustained the demurrer on
the ground that the indictment con
tained no matter upon which the issue
could be presented to a jury. There
was nothing in the indictment, said
Judge Dooling, apprising the defend
ants of what they were accused beyond
the general statement that they had
conspired to set on foot a military ex
pedition for the purpose of destroying
ships belonging to Germany's enemies,
and blowing up bridges, railroads and
factories in Canada.
It was further declared by the court
that there was nothing in the indict
ment to show that the activities re
sponsible for the alleged bombing of
bridges and factories in Canada con
stituted what could be called a military
expedition and were not merely direct
ed against the individual owners of the
property destroyed or threatened.

PARIS, March 3. The French offi
cial eye witness gives the following de
scription of the defense of Herbebois,
three miles to the north of Fort Douau
mont, where the great battel of Verdun
began twelve days ago:
"It was on February 21 at 7:20 o'clock
in the morning that the Germans be
gan the preparation for their attack.
They unloosed a formidable artillery
fire on the positions which they wished
to capture and shells of all calibres fell
like hail from those 150 millimetres
to shells of 305 millimetres. It was
a veritable drum fire of an intensi
ty unknown till now, and this drum
fire played by series on objective
points selected for attack. A zone 500
meters broad and a kilometre deep for
example, was pounded in such fashion
that the earth was ploughed up on the
entire superficial extent in mathe
matical fashion. Lacrymosal shells
and suffocating gas shell were also
employed by the enemy to accentuate
the moral effect. However, despite this
formidable rain of projectiles, the Ger
mans on the first day succeeded only
in entering our first line of defense at
Herbebois and taking a small support
ing work of the line. It was a miser
able result compared with the mechan
ical effort and human effort which they
had put forth against our advanced
line of resistence. It was then that my
regiment was called upon to counter
attack and to try to recapture the first
line lost. When I say line it must be
understood that there were only some
chaotic elements of trenches and fur
rows torn up with shell holes.
"At midnight, accordingly, on the
21st the men were in position and we
were rather happy at having at the
iirst moment of our appearance on the
ground taken sixty-three prisoners who
seemed to be very glad not to have to
measure themselves against us any
further.
"Our counter attack took place on
February 22 at 4:30 o'clock in the
morning. Then the bodies attacked
again. No one had the advantage there
this affair. Then during the dav there.
I "l ollr men strained every effort under
tlle protection of the grenade throwers
to consolidate our positions. At this
moment we no longer had any nat-
ural shelter. Herbebois is covered with
tree "tumps among which some large
trees stand up. On a depth of three
to four hundred metres behind Is or
dinary undergrowth, but the Germans,
had opened upon it a terrible outpour
ing of projectiles and the wood at cer
tain places was transformed into a
clearing. It was necessary, therefore,
to maneuver through this confusion by
climbing and crawing and to work and
raise barricades and to organize the
shell holes. It was snowing, and I
leave you to imagine the endurance
which our men showed in the circum
stances. "During the course of the night of
February 22 the Germans renewed their
offensive. A bombardment of amji.
! '1 vk'Ience and of a mortal precision
did not permit them, however, to ad
vance an inch. When their infantry in
turn attempted to strike, our men made
them suffer sanguinary losses. It was
still worse during the day of the 23rd.
After having once more copiously
rained shells on our lines, the Germans
sent against us at least the equivalent
of a battalion. This attack in a body

shortage in the various ratings, he
explained, however, would not mater
ially injure the efficiency of the
fleet were it called upon Immediately
to engage an enemy.
The lack of officers was the most
serious aspect. Admiral Fletcher
thought, because it requires ten yearn
to train a competent lieutenant or
lieutenant commander. Nothing that
congress, much less the navy depart

the situation at once. Many sugges
