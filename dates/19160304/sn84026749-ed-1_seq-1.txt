Action In House Postponed Until First of

Out In Senate Over Statement
By Lodge In Debate
NO SOLUTION YET,
North Dakota Senator Asserts That Every
thing Still Is Up In the Air Regarding
Bitter Controversy Over Proposed
' Warning To Americans
"The tabling of the Gore resolution did not meet the President's
own proposal. If wc take- the usual construction of a tabling
motion namely, that it implies opposition to the measure
tabled the Senate voted yesterday that the killing of an
American is not a cause for war." From Statcmcni by Sen
ator McCulnbcr in the Senate today.
'dminislration leaders in the Mouse wre unable to
force vote today on the armed liner issue.
Atter all plans had been made for a vote, virtually one
of conildence in the President, strong opposition broke out
and there is every indication that action will be postponed
until the first, ofjhe. weekv ,' -,- J
Meanwhile in the Stmate discussion "of the lirmed
merchantmen-submarine question broke out again. t ' '
Senator L.odge started the argument by a statement,
read into the record, that the British government had
never, as reported, issued a warning during the Japanese
Russian war to its subjects to stay off armed merchantmen.
STILL "UP IN THE AIR."
Senator McCumber took the floor and in the course of
a sensational statement said, "The action yesterday in no
.way met the view's of the President" and declared that the
question was left "up in the air."
Many Senators renewed their assertions that what
happened yesterday was in effect to shunt aside all ques
tions which might serve to hamper the Chief Executive in
his handling of the grave international situation.
In the meantime President Wilson is marking time. .
Before making final reply to Germany's Jatest sub
marine campaign the President is waiting definite informa
tion in two important questions.
WANTS ACTION BY HOUSE.
First he wants to know whether the House will vote
lo stand by American rights and against interference with
the Executive.
He also wants to know whether British orders to
sink submarines gives Germany grounds for abandoning
the rules of civilized warfare. ' '
The -copies of the British admiralty orders, attached
as appendices to the German submarine declaration, arc
due to reach New York on the steamer Rotterdam tomor
row, the State Department was advised today.
With this information and with (he issue closed in
Congress President Wilson may be able to hand a reply
to Count von Bernstorff next week.
