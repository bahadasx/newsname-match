I take this means of expressing

fought so valiantly for my candi

office in my own way and I assure
them that I will be the assessor of
all the people and will not be the
assessor of any political boss or
political clique. A. L. ANDRUS.
KELLY ANDRUS SWEEPS THE
PARISH IN TUESDAY'S ELECTION
People's Candidate For Assessor Is An Easy Winner
Over Charles Thibodeaux By 127 Votes Carrying
Four Of The Six Wards
The tale has been told. Kelly
Andrus is a winier in the race for
assessor by the handsome majority
of 127 votes, having`defeated his op
ponent, Charles 'Thibodeaux, in four1
wards by good votes, while he tied
the fifth and lost the fourth by a
small vote.
The Andrus victory
came. as an un e x
pected shook to the supporters of
M. L. Swords, who had 'made such
a fight to down the Grand Coteau
boy in favor of the man, who had
fought the sheriff so hard four
years ago. But the *voters of St.
Landry knew Kelly Andrus as a
good man; they knew that lie would
do his duty and therefore would
serve the taxpayers in a most ef
fective manner, hence his flatter
ing majority on last Tuesday.
The Opelousas, Washington and
Eunice polls, which were expected
to give Thibodeaux overwhelming
majorities, only gave him a lead of
41 votes, which was easily over
come. Opelousas went for Thibo
deaux by only 66 votes, while on the
25th of last month Tibodeaux had
lULL MOOSERS FORM
LOCAL PARKER CLUB
Over One Hundred Voters Attend
Saturday Night's Meeting
JUDGE E. D. ESTILETTE
IS CHOSEN PRESIDENT
Enthusiastic Parkerites Endorse
Candidacies of Edwin Broussard
and Edward B. Dubuisson
The first Parker Club to be or
ganized in this parish was formed
last Saturday night when a large
number of Parkerites assembled at
the courthouse and in an enthusi
astic manner went about to organ
ize an Opelousas Parker Club.
Judge E. D. Estilette, one of the
original Parker men of this parish
and one of the most respected citi
zens of St. Landry was chosen by
unanimous consent as president of
the Parker Club, with J. J. Thomp
son, vice president and Rt. L. M.
led Andrus by 153 votes, Washing
ton by a majority of one vote went
in the Thibodeaux column, while
Eunice favored Andrus by 26 votes.
The only poll which Mr. Andrus
did not carry, in which he had led
Mr. Thibodeaux in the first pri
mary, was Grand Prairie, which he
lost by five votes.
Swords and Thibodeaux followers
had fond expectations of carrying
five of the six wards of the parish,
but when the votes were counted
the "Mighty First," which has never
failed going for the candidate sup
ported by the sheriff, delivered an
Andrus majority; the sixth ward,
counted as a sure Thibodeaux ward
went for Andrus, as did the second
and third wards.
There is no doubt that A. L. An
drus was the best fitted aspirant
for the office of assessor; the voters
of this parish, left to cast their bal
lot for the best man, did not hesi
tate to elect Mr. Andrus.
Mr. Andrus set an example to all
future politicluns of St. Landry in
the recent campaign by carrying on
one of the cleanest political cam

Clelland, secretary-treasurer.
Judge Estilette "nd Hon. E. B. Du
huisson made splendid addresses
along the lines of independent poli
tics, urging those present to stand!
to their convictions regarding the
Independent candidate for governor.
The feature of the meeting, ac
cording to those present, was the
interest evinced by the majority of
the Parkerites, who took active
interest in the meeting.
While. like the Pleasant Club, the
Parker Club here has only been or
ganized it has a large number of
prominent citizens within its ranks,
over one huidred and sixty Par
kerites being enrolled.
Resolutions were adopted by the
club urging the candidacies of John
M. Parker, Edwin Broussard and
E. B. Dubuisson.

paigns ever staged in old St. Lan
dry; unlike the opposition he did
not go in every community in the
parish and promise the same job to
scores of different voters, in an at
tempt to secure votes; he is ,oneI
man 'that was elected to an office
in this parish without making one :
single solitary promise.
On Wednesday morning hundreds
of friends of Mr. Andrus from every
section of the parish poured into
town to congratulate their candi
date; he met them in the same cor
dial manner in which he met them
before; he assured them that he
would conduct his office on a busi
ness basis, and the voters have
every reason t. believe that the as-i
sessor's office of this parish will be
one of the best conducted in t.is
state.
As can be seen b y
t,1he returns the country
people stood by Andrus to the very
last, giving him a majority of prac
tically two hundred votes.
:,X Andrus will not quali;y as
assessor of this parish until next
spring. There is no talk of getting
out Progressive candidates for pa
rochial officers.
The election of Mr. Andrus shows
conclusively that the self-styled
Marrero of this parish, maker of
all politicians who have succeeded
in landing in office, self-constituted
father of St. Landry Democracy, is
not yet entitled to the name of
Kaiser William the First, Emperor
of St. Landry.

Dr. and Mrs. A. H. Simpson, who
have been spending some tin.e in
this city as, the guest of Mrs. Simp
son's mother, Mrs. Mizzi, will leave
this (Saturday) morning for New
Orleans where they will take' in
Mardi Gras, befone departing for
their northern home, Provost, Al
berta, Canada.
Dr. and Mrs. Simpson were resi
dents of Arnaudville for a number
of years before they decided to take
to the cold regions; after arriving
in Provost, Canada, they concluded
that- they would make that place
their permanent home. They de
clare, however, that this is the best
country in the world, and while
they are returning to Canada they
feel sorry that they have to leave
such a splendid climate for the
snowy fields of the Canadians.
The Simpsons remained in this
parish visiting friends and rela
tives for the past two months, dur
ing which time they assert they had
a most enjoyable time.
HARHRODER AND WIFE
HAVE NARRhW ESCAPE
Prominent Citizens of Coulee Croch(
Thrown into Deep Crevasse
HORSE WAS FRIGHTENED
BY RAILROAD HAND CAll
Mr. and Mrs. William Hargroder
Rescued by S. P. Section Creu
Near Veltin's on Thursday
Mr. and Mrs. William Hargroder
prominent and well known resi
dents of the Coulee Croche section
of this parish narrowly escaped
death, on Thursday morning, when
their horse was frightened at a
hand car, which had been placed
by the Southern Pacific section
crew, near the roadway.
As soon as the Hargroders cross
ed the track, their horse saw the
car, which was covered with a
white tarpaulin; the animal, full of
4ife, at once began to make a break,
going down the steep hill, just on
this side of the Southern Pacific
crossing near Veltin's. The buggy
was backed until it fell into the
crevasse; while the buggy was fall
ing Mrs. Hargroder went head fore
most into the twelve foot crevasse,
plunging into about three or four
feet of water, just ahead of. the
buggy, which toppled ,over her.
Mr. Hargroder was followed ibto the
crevasse by the horse, which fell
right on the top of him.
Luckily the section crew, under
the foreman J. A. Rhodes, was
nearby, and no sooner had they
seen what had happened, when they
rushed to the assistance of the aged
citizeng; Mrs. R4rgruder was. puled
out fror~ under the buggy, 'only
bruised a little, while Mr, Har'
groder was taken out little the
worse for his experience.
The railroad foreman, when in
terviewed on Thursday morning
stated that it was certainly a mira
cle that both Mr. and Mrs., Har
groder were not killed outright.
The horse was not injured to any
great extent, but the buggy -was.
broken into pieces.
Mrs. Joseph Sibille, with tier son
and lady friends were passing just
as it happened, and picked up Mr.
and Mrs. Hargroder, who were
rushed to their daughter's: home,
Mrs. Alfred Vidrine, where dry
clothes were procured, thereby
averting serious illness.
\Mr. Hargroder has employed the
serviced of a lawyer and will pr use
cute the Southern Pacific for al
lowing its employees to leave a
hand car right on the road way:
MILLS WINS EASILY
FOR POLlEE JUROR
Head of Farmers' Union Is elected
by 90 Votes
COUNTRY PRECINCTS GO
FOR HIM BY LARGE VOTE
Bellevue People Will Have Repre
sentation in St. Landry Parish
Pollee Jury in RI Lee Mills
.The race for police juror from
this ward proved interesting, al
though R. Lee Mills, president of
the St. Landry Farmers' Union, de
feated Lbuis Hebert by a majority
of 90 votes.
Mr. Mills and Mr. Hebert were
tied in the first primary and were
therefore compelled to run' in the
second race. Bellevue and Plais-:
ante gave Mr. Mills handsome ma
jorities, while Opelousas went for
Mr. Hebert by only 36 votes.
The two candidates for police
jury were known to be good men,
gentlemen 0. high standing an4
both suCoessful farmers. Mr. Mills,
however, had practically the solid
support of the country people, as
is shown by the returns of the
Plaisa.ce poll, which gave him, a
majority of 89 votes out of 421 cast,
and the Bellevue box went for him
by a, vote of 46 to 19.
Many of Mr. Mills' supporters felt
fearful of the result, as did the An
drus supporters, as Sheriff Swords
had openly declared war against
the Bellevue farmer, stating that
HE was going to elect Mr. Hebert.
But as in - the assor's fight it
was showna that the people were
