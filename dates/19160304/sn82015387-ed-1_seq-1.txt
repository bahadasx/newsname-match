a~r and -the importance -of the
el .e as a land builder, etat
that he considered these sub
Jects of meet importance to this
pigish. He said that we were con
tarnated with two facts: First, the
uiperative neceusity of developing
agriculture, and second, the -posses
lion of very poor land. Both of
these problems could be solved if we
went at them in a business wsar
In our stage of development, the
safest money crop that we can avow
is the right kind of forage crop0

polish as other 'se they, will nof·
make the gains. Mr. Perkins said
that he could not stress too strongly
the, importance of planting legumin
one or nitrogen gathering crops, like
cow peas, velvet and soy beans or
peanuts, as it was the only waay w1
eould build up a permanent fertility
of our lands. Nit'rogen is our moet
expensive fertilizer element, being
worth now about 27 cents per pound
and there was thousands of dollars
.wo . of this element in the air
indech could be coollected for plant
vue by the growing of legumes. He
had made a chemical analysis of
land in velvet beans which showed
an Inespes of nitrogen to te- value
of $20.00 per acre from the growth
of this plant. He stated that all
experiment station work in Louist
as, -Misosssppl; Tleas, shd other
states, had demonstrated that Our
sandy leand needed. phosphoric asid.
and plenty of it, but they had-never
got any results from the use of pot
ash on general field crops, though it
had .vea good results on some
truck crops. Most of our land also
needed lime.
•StMr. Turner Wright, with the U. S.
Butreau of Markets, disessed the
marketing sielde of farming and stock
raising. He said that there was no
use in growing or raising products
unlees we could-sell them. but we
could sell them If we put business
into our farming. Co-operation was
the key note to his address. Two
things were essential: - irst, -we
must putep-a 4uality product, what
.vra Ohe produet - might be, vege
tables, dairy products or stock.
Second, we must -cooperate iq the
marketing of our crops. He had
traveled over nearly all of the Unit
ed States in his work, and two prop
ositions stod out self-evident: First
that the bost .eeessul -ad pros
o s sa gle#l/alaaeetons were
those that were btasked up by good
ive._ ek. -Second, the .farmers
taWt MWpeorlspera ·were 4hose that
marketed their products on a co
operative basis. He thought that
the safest money c:op for the epmall
farmer in this.parish was rhot and
the dairy cow, especially as these
two went hand in hand. We should
take two or three good sows and
gradually build our herd. And
there should be a Babcock- tester in
every community, in order that we
could test our milk and determine
whether or not we had a profitable
cow. The best way to market our
dairy -products was in the form of
cream, as this he considered was
the moseet probable. And it should
be marketed by community eo-operas
tion. He was especiaoly Impressed
-with the business.
It was advised that itf a communt
ty retrgratin plant could not be
built, the edentage could be taken
of some established ice plant that
could furnish room for storage or
keeping -.otl meat prepared for tta
sarket.

PRESENT WAR

"The Warrens of Virginia"
Starring Blanche Sweet,
ts a Play of Special
Pathos. Program
for Week.
The LaskY-Belaseo production of
"'The Warreas of Virginia," with
Bilanhe Sweet in the stellar role, is
a most extraordinary photodramatic
lesson in the sufferings of war.
Though the battlefield scenes are ill
ed wit' martial heroism and dash,
one is -foreed to bear in mindn at
every moment-the domestic tragedies
of this strife of brother against
brother. The picture shows, with
speelal pathos, the sutfferings of the
Southern ftmilies in the closing
.dsys of the ,war, when starvation
stared the tattered army in the face
and when even the women and
chlaidren left at home did not have
the bare neeessities of life.
I .here is nothing false or melo

Vtrginia." It. is the sadl, s~olemn
