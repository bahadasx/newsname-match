BERLIN, March4.r?The German
savings bank, scored a remarkable
record in 1915, according to a
statement just Issned by Herr
Reusch, the statistician of these in
stitutions who estimates that the
gain in deposits for the year reach-'
ed at least $900.0QP,000, not taking
acount of the amounts withdrawn
for making subscriptions to the two'
war loans of the year. As subscrip
tions to the latter amounted to
about $1,070,000,000, tho net reduc
tion of deposits was about $170,
000,000. Reusch further says that
the gain in deposits was not due
entirely to money being brought to
the banks, but also to a much larg
er extent than ever before.
The number of outstanding books ?
in which the accounto of depositors
are kept was increased in 1915 at
a rate never before recorded. An
inquiry made in tho-larger towns
and industrial centers shows that
these books increased by 4.7 per
cent whereas Uiq greatest increase
previously recorded was 4.4 per
cent; and Reusch assumes.that the
rate of increase-in the country dis
tricts was fully as great.

ally arranged. Action taken'against

The warrant called for a sale of the
goodB on March 4.

was Issued.. This was done In order
that Mr. Hartley'couid get possession

son made immediate preparations to
get new furniture from Pittsburgh not
being satisfied to wait'until the later
date to open_up his restaurant.
Tho goods at present are . stored in

ances March is Not So
5'. Awful.
The faithful alarm clock which
rings whether the morning Is cold or
warm, fair or cloudy, Is unappreciated
these March mornings. Many-of the
persons who boast of their cold show
er every morning-are saying little. No
one but . stockholders of the gas com
pany seem" pleased with the first sam
ples of March weather, which came
In tho form of' snow yesterday and
last night and' low temperatures this
morning.
The optimists are still hopeful for
the best - patent medicine alamanacs
and" the United States Weather bu
reau coupled with the law of probabili
ties indicate that a> change will occur
before the', ides of.;March arrives.
I March last year was the coldest of
record? for.,the past^twenty-flye years.
The average temperature for West
Virginia was 34.4 ^degrees.
Although the, month was the cold
eat, yet It was remarkably1 free from
unusually cold 1 period's,', the tempera
tures from day .to" -<day being. excep
itlpnally uniform. The snowfall last
year was above the March,'average,
but the actual precipitation was very
