AGITATION BECOMES VIGOROUS
"The London Letter of the New
Orleans Morning Star of last week
contains much pertaining to Ire
land's affairs that Is of Interest just
now. Tho correspondent says:
Cardinal Bourne has been in
negotiation with the Government
and In close counsel with the Irish
members for some days regarding
tho question of the status of relig
ious orders, and especially the
teaching congregations, under tho
compulsion bill, which has passed
both houses. While the measure
provides for the exemption of all
men In holy orders or ministers of
denominations, or church students,
it does not provide for men liko lay
brothers, or such congregations as
tho Christian Brothers, the Xaver
lans, etc. Such congregations have
done splendid woik in our schools
and are more than ever necessary
now that the war 1ms so largely
depleted the numbers of the secular
teachers. A deputation consisting
of repiesentatives of eight congrega
tions, among which were the Mar
ists, the Xavorlans, the Christian
Brothers, the Brothers of de la
Salle and others, had a long inter
view with Cardinal Bourne last
week, and then visited the Irish,
members at the House of Commons.
After subsequent lengthy conversa
tions between John Redmond and
the Cardinal Archbishop of West
minster it was arranged, to leave
negotiations with the Govornment-in
the Cardinal's hands, and it is un
derstood that favorable onscidera
tion will be given to His Eminence s
demands.
The Irish raombers have, however,
another service to peiform for Cath
olics. Questions are to bs asked
'"ih'llifrJHotrse andan agitatloncom
menced for tho repeal of tho re
maining penal statutes of tho Cath
olic emancipation act, consequent on
an arbitrary atclon taken by the
local Government Board of Ireland.
For many years the Alhlono County
Council has remitted tho rates on
tho local Franciscan friary, an act
it is perfectly Justified in, since cer
tain rellgous and charitable estab
lishments may be exempted. The
Local Government Board auditor
has, however, this year taken excep
tion to the proceeding and has
charged the members of tho council
with tho amount. As the members
do not see why they should pay
these rates out of their own pockets,
they asked an explanation from the
authority in question and were told,
to their intense amazement and in
dignation, that tho relief measures
could not apply to Franciscan friars,
slnco by tho laws of England the
same were outlaws. At a crowded
meeting of tho council, the Catholic
and Piotestant members unani
mously decided to fight tho matter
to the last ditch. They pointed out
that in England an effort to get the
samo order declared outlaw had
failed before Justice Day, and Par
liamentary representatives were
asked to take the matter up. It has
been unanimously decided by Eng
lish and Irish alike that tne time
has como when tho penal clauses of
the Catholic emancipation act must
be repealed, and that without delay.
That Catholic prelates havo some
Influence with the authorities is
shown by tho fnct that the public
protest of the Bishop of Kerry re
garding the consoling of corre
spondence has had Its effect. Al
though tho Postmaster General did
not give a very satisfactory answer
In the House when asked by a Cath
olic member for an explanation, tno
Bishop is pleased to record that
since his letters to the Postmaster
General and the War Offico tho cen
soring of his correspondence nnd
those of the religious Institutions of
the district has suddenly ceased and
ho feels it Is owing to his efforts
in this direction. Tho Irish Bishops,
however, have now another real
grievance, which will probably bo
carried to the house, cardinal
Loguo and his suffragans have is
sued a public protest against the
cessation of the grant to the Irish
colleges for classes in Gaelic and
rural science, The Bishops, in a
well-reasoned argument, agree with
tho necessity for rigid economy at
the present tlmo, but point out that
economy should bo In tho right di
rection. They point out also that
. grants are still being made in Eng
land for now schools, while grants
for such schools in Ireland havo
ceased altogether. They desire that
no differentiation shall be made be
tween Irish and English children In
the wants of tho day. The Bishops
i r,,inviotii that it is possible
the Government will stop the fees
for science paid to the secondary
schools, and they point out the bad
results and bad Impression such a
course taken at the present time
will produce when the bonds which
bind Iroland to the Empire should
be strengthened by every posslblo
means, since she is pouring out her
beat blood on foreign fields for Bng
land, as well as" her own fertile
wltey. The Gaelic League has also
lined a .protest against an action

THE MEANING OF THE SEASON
Ash Wednesday, tho beginning of
Lent, falls this year on March 8.
Some of the early Christians began
tho Lenten fasts on Septuagesimal
niiaiLrhutittliTJiUrchlfaWpreSentl
begins tho Lenten fast on Ash
Wednesday, forty days (Sundays ex
cluded) before Easter, in honor of
the forty days that the Saviour
fasted, and step by step she fol-
tows Him through his public mission.
During this tlmo she invites her
children to mourn with Christ over
their sins and tho sins of tho world;
to fast as He fasted and pray as He
prayed. Step by step she follows
Him through his bitter Passion; on
Good Friday she fairly breaks down
with sympathy and sorrow, crjyng in
tho Greek and Latin tongues: "Holy
God! Holy and strong God! Holy and
Immortal God! Have mercy on us!"
What Is tho origin of fasting?
Under the old laws the Jews fasted
by tho command of God; thus Moses
fasted forty days and forty nights, on
Mount Sinai, when God gave him the
Ten Commandments; Elias in liko
manner fasted in the desert. Jesus
also fasted, and commanded his
apostles to fast also The"Cntholic
church, says St. Leo, from the time
of the apostles, has enjoined fasting
upon all the faithful,
i Why has the church Instituted the
fast before Easter?
First To Imitate Jesus Christ,
who fasted forty days.
Second To participate in his
merits and passion:' for as Christ
could only be glorified through his
sufferings, so in order to belong to
Him we must follow Him by a llfo
answering tp his.
Third To subject the flesh to tho
spirit, and thus prepare ourselves for
Easter and the worthy reception of
the divine Lamb.
Fourth Finally to offer to God
tfo'mo satisfaction for our sins, and as
St. Leo says, to atono for the sins
of a whole year by a short fast of
the tenth part of a year.
How shall w keep tho holy season
nt T.ont with advantage?
w oiimiifl endeavor not only to
deny ourselves food and drink, but
still more, all sinful gratifications.
And as the body is weakened by
fasting, tho soul, on the other hand,
should bo strengthened by repeated
prayers, by frequent reception of
tho holy sacraments, attending mass,
spiritual reading and good works,
particularly inose 01 uiuud.
such a manner we shall bo able, ac
cording to the intention of the
church, to supply by our fasting what
wo have omitted during tho year,
especially if we fast willingly and
with a good intention.

WHERE THE GREAT DANGER LIES
In our public piints and in our
many recent vice Investigations pov
erty and the lures of tho "white
slavei" have been proclaimed as the
nrlnclnal causes of tho downfall of
-6ung3,glrlBattheipi;esi!nt2daya'hat'
theso two factois have played a
piomlnent pait in the lulnatlon of
manj women can not at an do
doubted. It can bo readily undei-
stood that a gitl working for mis
eiably low wages, allowing to her
not even the uaie necessities or
life, much less many of the littlo
luxuries which she craves, eking
out her existence in dlstiessing
fashion, would bo weakened amid
the whlil and pressuio of daily life.
It can also be leallzed how a girl
fallen at one time would bo likely
to vield to a sense ot despair and
consider the lest of her lifo as lost
to normal, decent existence. nut
beyond and beneath these factors,,
which it must bo said havo been
gieatly ovoistressed, there are other
fundamental considerations wnicn
play a great part in our modem lifo
in the weakening of the moral
fiber or our youths and maidens.
Perhaps tho most important ono of
all is the lessened feeling ot le
sponslblllty on tho part of patents.
"Tho ago of obedient parents" has
our time been called. The ago oi
neglectful parents, It might likewise
well be named. Our people In gieat
numbers seek today to avoid the
obligations of parenthood in the
first place by limitation of off
spring and then by paying but
slight attention to the training of
MifiKi children which are theirs. To
Uhlrk lesponslbillty is the predom
inant cnaraciensuc oi me wuu.
As striking illustration of this
Important fact, the testimony of a
keeper of a public dance hall before
tho Illinois Senate Vice Committee
la rtPRprvine of nuotation. The
Chairman of the committee put to
tho witness the following question:
"Is it your opinion that low wages
have anything to do with the vice
pioblem?" His answer wns: "Yes,
Bifro, I think so, but that Isn't all.
The tiouble Is that it is the folks"
at home that ought to keep the girl
under supervision until she is ai
least eighteen years old. But tho
trouble Is nowadays that it Is tho
high living that 80 per cent, of tho
people want. They want something
that is just a little bit spicy. They
don't probably allow, a lot 'of them
don't want vory much, but they
want to see It. A lot of theso girls
If they get a new dress feel that
they can go a little bit further than
they used to go with their small
wages." And then the Important
point is emphasized. "And," ho
continued, "thero is another lino;
It is a great deal of trouble to cater
In a hall to girls that have been
brought up in the wrong light. You
take today, look at the young girl3
that associate with boys that are
wiser than they were in my time
when I went to school. There Is
ono thing wo ought to do in this
country, to havo some means of In
ducing families to take care of chll
flron." ...
That Is an oloqount statement,
that what we need is "some means
of inducing families to tako care
ot children." It strikes the impor
tant point very emphatically and
BffBP.tivelv. Parents must realize
the duty whlcli is theirs to watch
m-or their children's conduct and to
carefully supervise the choice or
their children's companions. That
this can be carried to an unreason
able extreme will of course readily
be eranted. But there is very little
of the j danger ot the exletenc of this ex
treme In our country at the present
day. The danger, a most impor
tant ono, lies entirely In the oppo
site way that our parents, by
their own selfishness and lovo of in
ordinate pleasure, by tho ease with
which they dissolve the family tlo,
and by their utter neglect of their
offspring, prepare the way for that
offspring's moral ruination.
Surely it is time that something
hn rtnnn In 4 li f a m to ! G n ! xr If
I is time that our men In public life
j should emphasize the necessity of a
return to a .sense of responsibility.
And the basic fact which will lead
to this phenomenon is tho leturn
of religion to the people. Without
it they aio drifting into perilous
ways. With it they will bo able to
meet In tho proper manner tho com
plex problems of our modern life,
not the least of which is tho
problem of widespread sexual vice.

WILSON'S CHANCES ARE BRIGHT
Tho llutchcraft bill, backed by
Gov. Stanley and a combination of
liquor men and prohibitionists, will
bo Intioduced In tho Senato next
week, tho Houfo having passed it
by a close vote after quite a stormy
session last week. Democrats who
ate Inteersted In paity welfare hope
that Gov. Stanlej will lecedo from
the position he has taken and ab
stain fiom tiylng to shpve this ob
noxious measure down the throats
of the General Assembly simply be
cause his present position gives him
that power. In his speech at 'the
Moso Green banquet hero Monday
evening he deeded the fact that tho
present Legislatuio was wasting its
time on prohibiton and only echoed
the statement in these columns two
weeks ago that tho uppermost ques
tion at Frankfort was who could bo
the most fanatical on the dry side,
Haly and Palmer being busy daily
Injecting tho liquor question into
legislative affalis, the consequences
being that the dry men aro oppos
ing many good legislative measures
simply because they have been in
troduced by some member who is
opposed to prohibition.
To tho average Democrat the situ
ation appears thus: Early during
the session the prohibition bill was
decisively killed in the Senate, this
precluding the possibility of any
piohibition measuie passing that
body regardless of tho action of the
House. Now coupled with the fact
that another safeguard against pro
hibition was the Governor's voto, It
is nam io unuersionu way mo ,au
mlnlstiatlon haehteied the wot
and dry fight, ae theological move
would have boen to allow the Fouso
pass all tho dry measures in tho
world, knowing that they would be
killed lator.
Charges havo been made that tho
8oJepuxpojiOiOfjJheHuJkhcraft ,blH
is io capture uieueraocrauc organi--
zatlon in Loulsvillo and turn It ovor
to men allied with tho Haldeman in
terests, who aro known as original
Stanley me"n. If this be true and
Gov. Stanley Is a party to this ne
farious scheme, then an attempt to
wieck the Democratic party can bo
laid at his door, as this movo would
not only kill the party here, but
the decrease of former big majori
ties in this district would affect tho
party throughout tho State. Asldo
from this, tho Governor has been
In active politics long enough to
know that outside of a few tho
Stanley organization was composed
of many down-and-outers, men who
were not for Stanley because of his
record or personality, but simply
and solely becauso they were op
posed to the local administration
and Democratic organization. For
this support ho could hardly feel
flattered, and tho results in both
the Senatorial and Gubernatorial
primaries showed the aspiring lead
ers were very weak, only carrying
one ward In the city, and that by a
small plurality of sixty-three votes.
iVt the gathering last Saturday
evening Gov. Stanley saw tho very
flower or local Democracy, men wno
havo worked hard and faithfully
to make tho party what It is hero
today, and he should carefully con
sider before attempting to wreck n
successful organization. For the
good of the party tho Hutchcraft
bill should be beaten in tho Senato
and tho Governor should withdraw
his suppoit without hesitation.
Tho State Republican convention
here this week was a blow to tho
hopes of the Bull Moosers who, de
spite their falling strength-, hoped
