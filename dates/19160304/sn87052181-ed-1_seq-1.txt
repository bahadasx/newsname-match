ROAD LAW UPHELD
United States Supreme Court
Decides the Benefit District
Measure Constitutional.
VICTORY FOR GOOD HIGHWAYS
Under This Statute Property Owners
Alone Will Have the Say Regard
ing the Improvements.
The Missouri Benefit District Road
Law, involving the constitutionality of
more than seventy road districts In
Missouri, and which, it is snnl, will un
lock permanent road improvement in
tho state, was uphold the other day
by the supreme court us constitutional.
The case was that of tho Kansas City
Liberty Boulevard Road District.
Bonds voted by this district to build a
road aro now upheld as legal.
Tho fuvorablo decision is estimated
to do moro for tho cause of better
hlghwnys than anything that has hap
pened In tho state.
Roads may now bo built like city
streets by creating districts includ
ing none but benefited property own
era, assessing them in proportion to
the benefit they receive and giving
them ten years In which to pay.
There will now b'o no obligation to
watt on a whole county or township or
city to make up Its mind to build
roads. If a road winds, tho district
can bo made to wind with it. It may
be any width or any length, and the
vote is by acres, so tenants cannot
defeat improvements of this kind. In
terested property owners and none
other, have tho power to decides
Tho decision clears the way of de
lays. When owners of most of tho
land involved petition for such a road
tho county court will submit the mat
ter to tho state highway commissioner.
If he indorses it, the court will make
up a proposal, set a day for objectors,
and then if approved, submit the plan.
Land within the first half ,mllo of
tho road will pay 100 per cent; from
one-half to ono mile, 75 per cent; from
ono to one and one-half miles, 50 per
cent, and over one and one-half miles
from the road, 25 per cent of the cost.

Springfield Street Railway Tied Up by
a Strike of the Conductors and
Motormen.
A walkout to enforco demands for
recognition of a new union affiliated
with the Amalgamated Association ot
Street and Electric Railway Employes

Eighty-eight of ninety conductors

HE best tlmo to read this
story would bo a night of
storm. For witli tho howl
of tho wind In his ears and
tho spatter of tho sleet
upon his windows it would
Boom good to tho reader to
ruflect that tho men of the
coast-guard patrol, in relays that In
terlock from sunset to sunrise on
clear nights and through all tho hours
of tho twenty-four on days and nights
.of darkness and danger, aro tramping
tho beaches of tho wholo United
States in an almost unbroken succes
sion from Quoddy Head to Capo Fear,
from Oswego to Duluth, and from Pe
terson's Point to tho Golden Gnto.
Nightly tho members of this hardy
and heroic band of men patrol a thou
sand miles of tho coast of this coun
try. They oscillato like a big pendu
lum. Away at tho far North a man
swathed in oil skins starts south and
at tho same timo a guard at the far
South starts north, and between theso
two end links of tho long chain thero
aro hundreds of other watchers, each
tramping hla boat to tho midway
point where ho meets tho patrol from
tho adjoining 'station, and then tramp
ing back to his quarters, alert every
minute, peering through darkness and
fog, blinding rack and flying spray,
ready any instant to burn a Coston
light, to hurry to tho wlro with a re
port ot a ship In trouble, or to leap
Into the lifeboat for a race through
the surf to a vessel in distress.
A Hard Life.
Tho coastguardsman's llfo Is a hard
ono. It abounds in peril. But It has
tho fascination ot the lure of danger,
and no enlisted man of tho army or
navy surpasses tho beach patrol In
fidelity to duty or Ingenuity in dovls
ing ways to help tho helpless. It is
no unusual thing tor a guard to be
blown off his feet by a gale, and some
times bo Is washed out to sea. No
wonder his faco is hard as leather,
for ho has to mnko his way through
rain, sleet and sand many nights ev
ery winter, nnd through tho driving
blast ho must see all that a keen and
trained pair ot good eyes can seo In
tho midst of a storm that would lcavo
tho landlubber helpless. Many n time
In tho teeth ot a stiff northeaster ho
pulls his tired legs through sodden
sand Into which ho sinks to his boot
tops at every step, stumbling over
half-burled casks and timbers that
have been thrown up by the sea. On
clear nnd cold nights tho beach may
bo hard and smooth, but such nights
often enough aro of freozlng tempera
ture. But tho guard never falters. Ho
bucks tho gale nnd endures tho cold,
his eyes always watchful and nil his
senses quick to catch tho tokens ot
human need and possible rescue.
A Visit to the Station.
It Is nn illuminating oxpcrlenco to
visit ono of theso stations. It matters
but little which ono you may choose
to seo. Every station has its history
and Its traditions, but all aro similar
in .their methods of work and in gen
eral equipment.
Probably you would appreciate a
visit to tho Peaked Hill Bars station.
It is n brown wooden building which
n stranger unaided might havo hard
work in finding. It Is but a fow hun
dreds of feet from the shore line, nnd
yet Is invisible both from tho beach
nnd from off shore. Big hummocks, of
sand havo boon piled about It by tho
shifting winds, and on every sido

THE WORLD OVER

Union county, Ore., has caused a hot

know you aro in good hands nnd wel
come. At Race Point.
Or you may choose Race Point for
your visit. You find tho road a mllo
nnd a halt from Provlncctown lifting
slowly, and at the top you stop to'
look beyond upon the long reach of
sand, heaped into curious mounds,'
with tho curving shoro nnd tho heav
ing sea beyond. Amid theso sand
mounds tho road winds along, then
climbs abruptly to tho summit of a
cliff, and there nt the top aro tho
three gray buildings of the Race
Point station.
It may bo your good fortune or ill
fortune, as you chooso to bo at
Peaked Hill when a storm rages. The
sand Is beating liko ocean spray on
the windows of tho station house nnd
tho rain Is coming down in sheets.
Your experience Is likely to bo that
of a man who a fow years ago spent
several days at one of these stations.
Ho thus told of tho temerity with
which ho went out into the storm and
of his rather speedy return.
"Wo ate our breakfast by lamplight,
as tho windows wero battened up for

The Men and Their Lives.
If you can lngratlato yourself with
theso mon and stay nt a station for
sovernl days, you will get a rather
complete notion of tho life they lead
nnd tho kind of men thoy are, and of
tho rescues thoy havo accomplished.
Tho guardsmen aro ns a class
wcatherbcaten nnd strapping fellows,
recruited largely from tho Grand
Banks and Capo Cod fishermen. Many
of thum commanded vessels on tho
Banks beforo entering tho service.
Most of thom also have been local
pilots. Thoroforo thoy are very famil
iar with tho waters and coasts to
which they aro assigned, nnd in case
of war thoy would ho likely to be
very valuable becauso ot their local
knowledgo and tholr gonoral all-round
nbillty.
Theirs Is a military service. Tho
guardsmen aro actually enlisted, for a
year nt a tlmo In every enso, with tho
prlvllego of ro-onllstlng within n tow
days after tho expiration of their
tlmo, when tho service would bo ro
gordod as continuous. Many ot the

men thus como to consider theirs a
lifo service. Their training is ac
quired beforo their enlistment for tho
first time, largely from their previous
callings. At tho first enlistment 'thoy
must qualify as expert boatmen, thoy
must be physically sound and not
moro than thirty-five years of ago.
Tho service now has an nrrangement
by which the men may retire at three
fourths pay when they havo served
thirty years or have reached the ago
of sixty-four. But In tho former caso
they must hold themselves in readi
ness for any duty for which they may
bo called by tho secretary of tho treas
ury. In tlmo of war this servlco
would be transferred from the depart
ment ot tho treasury to that of the
navy.
On Duty Ton Months.
Tho stations, really tho homes of the
men for many months each year, nre
frame buildings, all of tho same gen
'oral pattern, housing four or five
boats and the keepers and crows. Tho
men aro on duty from August 1 to
June 1, ten months each year, and lu
that period thoy are allowed, in turn,
twenty-four hours of llborty. Each
crow consists of seven men and a
keeper. Thus tho men divide into
watches for the night, two and two,
with ono extra, and one off duty. Dur
ing June and July only the keeper is
at the station.
The beats over which these men
tramp measure all the way from two
miles to five In length, and when
making their rounds they cover tho
distance twico. In each caso of course,
onco out and onco back. The beats
.are regulated somewhat by the dis
tances between stations. It they aro
moro than ten miles apart the patrols
would not bo able to mako a round
in two hours. However, not every
mile of coast is patroled.
And now What happens If a ship
is Been in danger?
If a patrolman sees a vessel In trou
ble, which Is not yet actually a wreck,
ho burns a red signal light. The Cos
ton light Is a tubo-llko affair; a llttlo
tap on a spring and a percussion cap
explodes and that sets tho light aflaro;
It burns four minutes, with a brilliant
red flamo; seeing it, a crow knows
that their need has been noted and
that all assistance possiblo will bo
rendered them. If tho vessel already
is a wreck when she is seon, so that
tho servlco of tho station crow will bo
required, two Coston lights aro
burned.
Power Life Boats.
Moro nnd more the stations now
aro being equipped with power llfo
boats. All doponds upon tho possi
bility of using them. A power boat
cannot bo launched from tho beach
Itself liko a surf boat; It requires a

tho wires in sending out their alarms.
It a wreck Is acccssiblo to more than
