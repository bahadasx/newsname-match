mjarkable story of the same name by
Charles Wadsworth Camp that ap
peared recently in Collier's Weekly,

Arden and Barbara Tennant.
The story deals with a band of F
criminals who have killed a young po- e
'lice detective, Joe Kridel. His fian
cee, Nora, the daughter of a police in

AMERICA AND THE WAR.
Only Justice and Humanity Should
Drive Us Into the Conflict.
President Woodrow Wilson made a
very notable speech to several hun
dred members and guests of, the cele
brated Gridiron Club at a dinner
given by that organization at Wash
ington last Saturday night, which has
been released for publication in con
trav'ention of the usual rule applica
ble to utterances at Gridiron Club
s functions. The great importance of
I the president's views in the present
critical juncture of national and in
a tenational affairs led 'to the request
that he and the club consent to the
e making of the speech public in order
that it might "go to the country."
s It is stated that the president spoke
r with unusual gravity, and that his
s earnest and eloquent concluding
words brought his hearers to their
feet with enthusiastic cheering. The
address follows:
"I have very little to say tonight
- except to express my warm apprecia
tion of the invariable courtesy of
this club and of the reception you
have so genierously accorded me. I
find that I am seldom tempted to say
anything nowadays, unless somebody
starts something, and tonight no
body h-_s started anything.
"Your talk, Mr. Toastmaster, has
been a great deal about candidacy for
the presidency. It is not a new feel
ing on my part, but one which I en
tertain with a greater intensity than
formerly, that a man who seeks the
presidency of the United States for
anything that it will bring to him is
an audacious fool. The responsibil
ities of the office ought to sober a
man even before he approaches it.
One of the difficulties of the office
seldom appreciated, I dare say, is that
it is very difficult to think while so
many people are talking, and particu
larly while so many people are talk
ing in a way that obscures counsel
and is entirely off the point.
"Senator Harding was saying just
now that we ought to try when we
are a hundred million strong to act in
the same simplicity of principle that
our forefathers acted in when we
were three million strong.. I heard
somebody say-I do not know the ex
act statistics-that the present popu
lation of the United States is one
hundred and three millions. If there
are three million thinking the same °
things that the original three million
thought the hundred million will be t
saved for an illustrious future., They
were ready to stake everything for 1
an idea, and that idea was not ,ex
pediency, but justie. And the infinite
wind, but to aquarethe tEimigs you do
by the not simple, but complicated -
standards of justice. Justice has
nothing to do with any temporary
standard whatever. It is rooted and i
grounded in the fundamental instincts c
of humanity. I
"America ought to keep out of this a
war. She ought to keep out of this "
war at the sacrifice of everything ex
cept this single thing, upon which her A
character and history are founded
her sense of humanity and justice. If
she sacrifices that, she has ceased to
be America; she has ceased to enter
tain and to love the traditions which t
have made us proud to be Americans, p
and when we go about seeking safety
at the expense of humanity, then I,
for one, will believe that I have al- n
ways been mistaken in what I have
conceived to be the spirit of Ameri
can history.
"You never can tell your direction
except by long measurements. You
cannot establish a line by two posts; t
you have got to have three at least
to know whether they are straight
with anything, and the longer the line
Lhe more certain your measurement.
There is only one way in which to de
termine how the future of the United
States is going to be projected, and
that is by looking back and seeing
which way the lines ran which led up
to the present moment of power aria
of opportunity. There is no doubt
about that. There is no question what
the roll of honor in America is. The
roll of honor consists of the names
of men who have squared their con- r
duct by ideals of duty. There is no
one else upon the roster; there is no
one else whose name we care to re
member when we measure things up- r
on a national scale. And I wish that C
whenever ah impulse of impatience t
comes upon us, whenever an impulse
to settle a thing some short way
tempts us,we might close the door and
take down some old stories of what
American idealists and statesmen did
in the past, and not let any coun
sel in that does not sound in the au
thentic voice of American tradition.
Then we shall be certain what the
lines of the future are, because we
should know we are steering by the
lines of the past. We shall know
that no temporary convenience, no
temporary expediency, will lead us
either to be rash or to be cowardly.
I would be just as much ashamed to
be rash as I would.to be a coward.
Valor is self respecting. yalor is cir
cumspect. Valor strikes only when
it is right to striKe. - Valor withholds
itself from all small implications and
entanglements, and waits for the
great opportunity when the sword will
flash as if it carried the light of
heaven upon its blade."
An Interesting Experiment.
In the Salt River valley in Arizona
it is proposed during the 1916-17
campaign to grow 3200 acres in su
gar cane. and- 4000 acres in beets in
the same vicinity, and to use the same
sugar mill to manufacture both the
cane and beet sugar. The beet run
will come first, followed by the cane,
and by this method it is planned to
keep this plant in continuous opera

KNIGHTS OF EZELAH FEAST.
Pleasant Affair Enjoyed by Boys' Re.
ligious Organization.
On Friday night of last week the
Knights of Ezelah enjoyed a delight
ful feast at their hall in Opelousas
street. The girls of the Methodist
Sunday School served them a tempt
ing lunch of sandwiches, salad, cake
and lemonade. H. L. Baker, of
Plattenville, acted as toastmaster, and
toasts were responded to by John
Huniey, the king; Jas. Chapman, the
prince; Wilfred Binnings, the scribe,
and O. B. Webb, of New Orleans.
Mr. Webb was guest of honor, and
came a half day ahead of time, to at
tend the men and religion meeting, in
order that he might speak to the boys.
His talk dealt largely with the place
that good morals and religion play in
a man's business success. He told
the boys that more and more the
cigarette smoker and whiskey drink
er are finding it hard to hold good
positions, as men of sober and clean
habits are wanted by first-class busi
ness concerns. He commended their
organization and said he wished his
boy in New Orleans had one like it,
and altogether the occasion was a
happy and profitable one.
The Knights of Ezelah is an or
ganization for boys connected with
the Methodist Sunday School and their
friends of other Sunday Schools wh,
affiliate with them. The word "Eze-'
lah" is a secret word that unfolds as
the members take the four degrees of
the organization. The membership is
composed of boys from the ages of
twelve to eighteen years who .come
up to certain standards of religious
and moral living. Among other things
they must be regular attendants upon
some Sunday School or its equivalent
in other religious instruction. Upon
joining they take a pledge "to try al
ways to do right, and to pray every
day and read their Bibles regularly."
With their leader they interpret the
"doing right" to include, among other
things, abstinence from the use of to
bacco and the playing of baseball or
other public games on Sunday. The
first degree already taken by this
class pledges them to reverence,
obedience, loyalty and courage. Some
parents testify that already they have
noted improvement in the conduct of
their boys since joining the organ
ization.
FEDERAL LAW IN FORCE.
Regulations For Protection of Migira
tory )Birds Not S ,spede
pended the enforcement of the federal
regulations under the migratory bird
law and by this means has enabled
sportsmen, under state laws, to shoot
wild fowl the coming spring.
Under the federal regulations as
they now stand, the season on all
migratory wild fowl is closed until
next autumn throughout the United
States. Federal inspectors and war
dens are required, and others inter
ested in the protection of wild fowl
are requested, to report to the Depart
ment of Agriculture all cases of vio
lations of the regulations, in order
that proper action may be taken.
The Department of Agriculture has
no power to suspend the law or to
pardon violations of the regulations.
Doubtless the erroneous impression,
on which the newspaper statements
are based, has grown out of the pen
dency of litigation involving the con
stitutionality of the act of congress
approved March 4, 1913, under which
the regulations were promulgated.
The lower federal courts disagreed as
to the validity of the statute and the
issue was carried to the supreme court
of the United States. The case was
argued in the supreme court in Octo
ber, 1915, but has not been decided.
Following the lower court decisions,
congress appropriated money for the
purpose of continuing the enforce
ment of the law. The Department of
Agriculture is bound to report to the
Department of Justice violations of
the regulations if the supreme court
should declare the law constitutional.
All persons should, therefore, be
warned of the danger they incur from
failure to abide by the regulations.

Commissioner Bruner is Peeved.
Commissioner of Agriculture and
Immigration Bruner doesn't take 'his
defeat in the Democratic primary at
all good naturedly. He claims that
he wasn't beaten by his enemies, but
by treacherous friends, and that he
was knifed by the New Orleans regu
lars in spite of the fact that he has al
ways been a regular himself, and gave
the city regulars all the patronage of
his office, "amounting to over $50,
000."
