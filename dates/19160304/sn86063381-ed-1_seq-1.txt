BEMIDJI LIBRARY
HASLARGEGROWTH
WUiJOST YEAR
Miss Beatrice Mills In, Annual
Report Institution in
of Funds.
15,696 BOOKS ARE
CIRCULATED IN 1915
European War Creates a Demand for
Newspapers and
Magazines.
That the Bemidji library is enjoy
ing a large growth and that the peo
ple of Bemidji are using the library
more than they have in the past, is
evident from the annual report made
today by Miss Beatrice Mills, libra
rian.
Over one thousand more books were
circulated during 1915 than were
circulated in 1914. The total cir
culation for 1915 was 15,696 and for
1914, 14,669. The 1915 circulation
was distributed as follows: 6,545 to
children and 9,151 to adults.
In Need of Funds.
Miss Mills in her annual report
stated that the chief point to be em
phasized is that of the need of more
funds to keep pace with the growth
of the city and consequent increas
ing demands for reference and other
purposes along educational lines. She
pointed out that every order, every
church and every trade had its own
literature. The report of Miss Mills'
in part is as follows:
"Every citizen ought to be able
to find something in the library that
concerns him personally. The build
ing up of a great library is the work
of many hands and the co-operation
of all our citizens is essential if the
library is to contain information on
every subject that is vital to this
community.
Registration.
"During the year 441 new cards
were issued, 275 to adults and 166
to children.
Circulation.
"The loan desk is not only the cen
tral point in the building but is the
center of all work in the institution.
The thought we ha-ve emphasized
this year is the relation of books to
each other, and especially the rela
tion of fiction to travel, biography
and other more serious works. This
plan, it is hoped, will help to solve
the problem of introducing the chil
dren to the adult collection.
"The total circulation for the year
was 15,696, and of these 6,545. were
children's books and 9,151 adult.
Book Collection.
"The total number of volumes in
the library at the beginning of the
year was 4,675, and 214 volumes
were added by purchase, making 4,-
889 at the close of the year. Four
teen volumes of magazines were
bound and 161 books rebound.
"The Woman's Study club present
ed to the library one hundred and
eight stereoptican views of the Unit
el States and five stereoscopes.
"A 1915 edition of the Internation
al Encyclopedia has been purchased.
Reading and Reference.
"The present European war has
created a demand for newspapers
and magazines.
"We have the following periodi
cals and newspapers on file: Book
man, Century, American City, Col
lier's Weekly, Everybody's, House
and Garden, Illustrated World, La
dies' Home Journal, Literary Digest,
Little Folks, McClure's, Modern Pris

Aid to Students.
"Special research work has been
required for club programs and nu
merous debates. It is the policy of
the library so far as possible to ex
plain the periodical index to stu
dents and others so they may ac
quire the power of helping them
selves.
Story Hour and Exhibits.
"A splendid exhibit of Indian pic
tures by Karl Moon was loaned to
the library for a week by the Beard
Art Galleries of Minneapolis, and
was greatly enjoyed by our patrons.
"A story hour has been conducted
on Saturday. No very systematic
work has been done but the children
have been told or read a story as
they have come and demanded it.
Receipts.
"Fines on overdue books, $44.24
rent, $15.00 renting collection,
$24.84 total, $84.08.
"The library board has been most
considerate and helpful at all times."

CITIZENS ASK THAT
THERE BE LI6HT
Numerous protests are being made
today by citizens against the turn
ing off of the arch of lights in the
down town section. It was pointed
out that the down town streets were
as dark last night as if the city were
preparing for a raid from the "mys
terious aeroplane. Th council at
the last session ordered the lights
turned off, believing that the new
gas filled arc would give the city
sufficient light. By turning off the
arches the city saves $60 per month,
but several citizens stated today that
if the city wants to save money on
lights, the chain of lights along the
lake shore where there is no path,
should be turned off during the win
ter months.
BEMIDJI IS FAST 6R0WIN6
AUTO DISTRIBUTING POINT
That Bemidji is fast growing to
be an automobile distributing point
is indicated by the amount of busi
ness being done through local firms.

first had one shipment of 22 cars
ordered to leave Minneapolis con
signed as follows: Seven to Bagley,
seven to Gonvick and eight to Be
midji. This week an order was
placed for 16 more cars to be d's-
tributed as follows: Four for Wil
liams, four for Baudette, two for
Clearbrook, one for Kelliher, one for
Northome and two for Cass Lake.
The Jewett Co. has placed orders

SIXTH DISTRICT TITLE
TIED MEANS ANOTHER GAME
Largest Crowd of Season Witnesses
Decisive Victory Over Down
State Team.
Bemidji's hopes for another Sixth
district championship and a place at
the state tournament at Carleton col
lege at Northfleld, were boosted last
evening when the high school five
overwhelmed th Brainerd quintet
by a score of 45 to 13.
Determined to Win.
Aside from the very first few min
utes of play, Brainerd never had a
chance. The Bemidji team went in
to the battle determined to win
and it didby a most decisive count.
Man "for man, Bemidji had it on her
down-state rivals and the ball was
played mostly in Bemidji territory.
The first half was very close, both
teams playing mostly on the defen
sive and was marked by much fast
and rough playing. Fouls were fre
quent, both sides being equally guil
ty. The first half ended with the
score 14 to 7 in Bemidji's favor.
Bailey Starts Count.
The second half started with Be
midji on the offensive. Bailey start
ed the scoring for Bemidji in this
period, securing the ball on the toss
up and going down the big floor for
a counter. On the next play he re
peated the same shot.
"Fuzz" Johnson, who went through
the first half without securing a bas
ket, was the big point getter in the
second half, securing nine baskets in
the last period. The shots were
made at all angles in rapid succes
sion and the large crowd showed its
appreciation of the work, of theJsr!fc.__
liant little forward.
Plays Good Defensive.
Tanner at the other forward posi
tion also played a star game, secur
ing eight baskets, several coming af
ter long dribbles. He also played
a strong defensive game.
The playing of Graham at left
guard was one of the games features.
He was in every play, following the
ball all the time.
Cameron at center outjumped and
outplayed the much-touted Warner
and was a power on both the offense
and defense.
Bailey at right guard played a
brilliant game and it was his two
sensational baskets which started the
scoring in the second half. He also
played a star defensive game.
Credit to Each.
From a specator's viewpoint the
Bemidji five showed up more bril.na
liant and faster*than it has in any
other gameb this season. Equal
ive
mus
credi
on the team as it was by teamwork
rather than individual playing that
Bemidji was able to roll up the big
score.
As each team has now won one
game, a third contest will be neces
sary to decide the championship of
the Sixth district and a place at the
state high school tournament.
At St. Cloud.
Bemidji proposes that the deciding
game be played at either Duluth or
St. Cloud, both cities having floors
of regulation size, while Brainerd
suggests playing the game at either
Aitkin or Little Falls. However, it
is believed that neither of the latter
two places will likely be chosen as
Bemidji is not willing to sacrifice its
chances of playing the deciding game
in a "pill box."
The contention of the local play
ers is no more than fair as they are
champions of this district and by a
comparative score of the two teams
this season Bemidji ought to have an
edge on choosing the playing floor.
Bemidji has made 72 points to 43
for Brainerd in the two games played
this season. This matter will prob
ably be settled between representa
tives of the two schools in a few
days.
Has Good Chance.
