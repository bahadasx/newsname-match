Greatest Sing Disaster in
Wor.d's
PROBABLY .-SURK- BY GERMANS
French Cruiser Was Used as a Trans
port and Had 4000 Men on
Board.
It was announced at the French
mluistry of war at Paris that there
were nearly 4000 men In board the
French auxiliary cruiser La Provence
when she was sunk In the Mediter
ranean on February 2C.
As the niinstry of marine on Feb
ruary 29 announced that the number
of .survivors of the Provence disaster
was estimated at 870, upward of 3130
lives were lost.
It was Btated that on board the
Provence were the staff of the 3d
colonial infantry regiment, the 3d bat
talion and 2d company of the 1st bat
talion, the, 2d machine gun company
and "one extra company.
The loss of more than 3000 lives in
the sinking of the French auxiliary
cruiser Provence is the greatest ocean
disaster of modern times. The previ
ous largest number of lives ever lost
in one wreck was when the White
Star liner Titanic struck an iceberg
off the Newfoundland banks on April
14, 1912, and sank with a loss of 1595.
Tho rescued numbered 743.
"No signs of a submarine were no
ticed either before or after the sink
ing. La Provence was armed with
five cannon of 14 contimeters, two of
57 millimeters and four of 47 millime

TWO FAST GAMES
Girls' Teams Play Good Basketball at
: Recreation Hall.
There were two excellent games of
basketball at Recreation hall Friday
evening witnessed by a good sized
crowd of interested spectators. The
visiting teams wore from Dalton,
Mass., representing the high school
and the Y. M. C. A. auxiliary. They
were opposed by the Bennington high
school five and the Bennington Rec
reation tea in.
At the close of the gamo between
tho high school teams there was a dis
agreement over the score due to the
failure. of the score keepers to turn in
reports that balanced. It was finally
agreed to award the victory to tho vis
iting team by a score of 11 to 10.
In tho contest between the school
girls, Dalton led iu the first half by a
score of 6 to 4 but in the second period
tho accurate basket shooting of Miss
Nash for Rennington put the A'ermont
school on an equal footing. Dalton's
ability to keep in the game was large
ly due to the accurate basket shooting
from tho foul line of Miss Hosburg.
The little lady had a fine eye for dis
tance and caged tho leather four
tinfeEj '
The" Dalton "Y" auxiliary won from
thoi Rehnington Recreation five by a
score of 7 to 3. In this game the
guards of . both teams seemed to out
class their, opposing forwards and al
lowed few opportunities to shout for
tho barket. At the end of tho first
half Renningtou had scored one point
on a foul basket to a blank scoro for
Dalton. In the second half,. Miss
Loomls, who is a former North . Ren
nington girl, was unkind enough to
score two baskets from the field and
a basket from the foul line, while the
best that Rennington could do was one
field goal. The summaries:

GOV. HAfiLY GIVES
STRONG ADORtSS
PROHIBITION
High School Hall Nearly Filled to
Hear Indiana Executive
SPOKE-Or PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
Prompted to .Take Up Anti-Saloon
Work from Results of Drink Mani
fest in Home State.
Hon. J. Frank Hanly, ex-governor of
Indiana, gave one Of the best ad
dresses in Bupport: of Prohibition at
the High school hall lust evening, that
has been heard in ..Bennington since
agitation over the Perry bill first be
gan to show signs of wakiug up ' the
state.
High school hall was nearly filled to
hear Gov. Hanly, us he drew a much
larger crowd than , Gov. Patterson of
Tennessee and gave a stronger and
more stirring address.' le is a Roose
velt type of speaker, and spoke from
a four-year experience with the liquor
traffic in Indiana aa he came into con
tact with it from the executive chair.
Gov. Hanly is a fighter. ,No one
went to sleep while his address was
in progress. Several times through
out the oration, his climaxes brought
hearty applause from his audience. He
was flowery without indulging in
cheap sentiment or threadbare similes,
and brought to bear upon his subject
all the fine oratorical points of an ex
perienced campaign speaker.
Gov. Hanly was born in a log cabin
In Champaign County, Illinois, not far
from the old homo of Abraham Lin
coln. He received moBt o! his early
education from his moUier, being able
to attend school but a fow weeks for
several years,; then at the age of 13,
started out to nidke;hJa.-way in the
world. AA 41 no had worked tip to the
governor's chair of Indiana. He could
have gone still, higher, but became dis
gusted by the Interference of the liquor
traClc in the law-making and adminls
tring of a great ; commonwealth, the
cases for executive clemency coining
up for his attention which he traced
back directly or indirectly to liquor,
and the pitiful sights he had witnessed
In the state's charitable institutions
and reformltorics among the children
handicapped for life from tho effects
of tho evil. ;: .
He started out to spend the rest of
his life, aiming what influence and ex
perience he had to driving tho liquor
business out of the nation.
Gov. Hanly was introduced by II. H.
Webster.
