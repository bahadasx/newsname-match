America's Naval Strength,
"Declaration of war against the

fective blockade. In addition there is
the American army which it is true at
present only numbers 90,000. which
could be augmented quickly by gen

militia forms an excellent basis.. With

have a formidable army.

British Cruiser to Rescue.
Now York. March 4. The Rergipe,
a Brazilian steamship which left this
port yesterday afternoon for South
American ports, collided with another
vessel early today about 60 miles
south of New York. An hour after
she had sent out an S. O. S. call, the
wireless operator on the Sergipe sent
word that his ship was safe and con
tinuing her voyage.
Conditions for wireless transmission
were bad this morning and the shore
station; could not decipher the name
of the ship with which the Sergipe
collided. The collision temporarily
disabled the Brazilian ship's wirelebs
apparatus. The first to answer the
Sergipe s call for help was a British
auxiliary cruiser believed to be the
Caronia. The Sergipe asked the
cruiser to "'stand by" but later sig
nalled '"Ail's well." It was reported
that the Caronia was the ship which
struck the Sergipe but wireless mess
ages picked up by nearby stations did
not confirm this.
The Sergipe is a steel vessel 'J SO

Lansing announced today that the ap

Secretary Lansing's announcement
was based on a cablegram from Am

of what the German government con
tends are confidential instructions to
commanders of British merchant ships

The attitude of the state department

William J. Bryan came to town to

speculated widely over whether Mr.
Bryan's coming had anything to do
with the delay on voting on the armed

nothing to do with the armed ship

Plans Are All Made if Worst

FURNISH ALLIES MUNITIONS
Torpedo Boats Would Be Sent

War College Has Even Solved
Transportation Problem.
Washington, March 4. Navy and
war department experts are discussing
the chances of war with Germany and
the manner in which the fleet and
army could be utilized to assist the al
lies. The war college has, as one of its
duties, the work of making plans cov
ering attacks by the United States on
any foreign power. Members of the
college say they have not been asked
to prepare any new plans. It is
known, however, that members of the
college and other experts have given
consideration to the question of possi
ble war with Germany.
Nearly al army and navy officers
of importance think it is absurd to
suppose that the projection of the
United Slates into the war could pos
sibly end the conflict by next summer.
They believe, however, that the end
would be brought nearer by the en
trance of the United States into the
conflict, but they believe also that
with the United States as an active
ally of England and France, the war
would still be drawn out, unless Ger
many, to save her face, should give up
the fight, as they believe she might
well do against such heavy odds.
Our First Moves.
The consensus of opinion is that two
i things would be done immediately if
the United States went to war with
Germany.
First, the torpedo boats of the
United States would be sent to the
English channel and the Mediter
ranean to assist in clearing the
seas of submarines.
Second, the United States would
send at or.ee 500,000 rifles for dis
tribution among English, French
and Russian recruits. The Unit
ed States now has 500,000 rifles
to spare and it is known these
rifles are the one great need in
the camps of the allies. This
would be followed as soon as pos
sible by another 500,000 rifles.
The United States would then begin
I
' to raise and equip an expeditionary
force of from 400,000 to 500,000 men.
It is asserted it would be impossible
' to get this force ready for any kind of
campaign within less than six months,
; As the first expeditionary force
would be only a small part of the

WHERE IS THE GAS
The Greatest Shortage Experi
enced in Topeka in Years.
o Accident to Pipe Line Has
Been Reported.
Why gas users were unable to ob
tain sufficient gas yesterday or to
day to warm coffee for breakfast or
the baby's bath in the afternoon is
still unexplained.
Several guesses have been offered
but they are widely divergent.
Here is L. G. Treleaven's, manager
of the Consumer's Light, Heat and
Power company :
Due to recent mild weather, the
late season and the promise of the
weather man that spring weather was
here persons who had been depending ;
on coal for heat earlier In the winter j
were caught unawares. Confident that j
the cold spell would be of short dura- j
tion thev returned to gas and conse- ,
quently the demands were greater
proportionally on the supply than at
any time during the winter.
Mr. Treleaven declared this morn
ing that he had received no report
from the Kansas Natural Gas com
pany, which supplies the local com
pany with gas of any trouble. Hence
his theory of the heavier demands. No
definite information regarding an in
creased demand can be obtained how
ever, until after the meters are read,
Mr. Treleaven says.
From the half starved and near
frozen consumer comes another
theory. Mixed with the sulphurous re
gards that are paid the company
are implications that frigid zone tem
peratures are clinching arguments for
36 cent gas. Belief that gas is being
withheld from consumers until the
price is advanced was heard frequent
ly during the day.
At any event, it is the worst short
age in years.
WARMING UP AGAIN

Mrs. Green Sells Famous "Old
Eureka' Gold Mine.
Extinct Since 77 Said to Have

San Francisco, March 4. The pur
chase from Mrs. Kettle Green, the
New York capitalist, of the "Old F.u
reka'' gold mine at Sutter Creek,
Amador county, California, by a syn
dicate of eastern millionaires was an
nounced here today. The price was
said to have beer, more than $1,000,

the announcement were William K.
Corey, steel magnate, John L. Ryan
and Tom Cole, of the Anaconda group,
and Ambrose Monell of the Interna
tional Nickel company.
The mine long known as "Hettle
Creen's pet kitten," was opened for
a brief period in the early seventies
and was reputed to have produced
$20,000,000. In 1877 Mrs. Green
closed the mine down and caused it
to be flooded with water. The ex
planation for her action given at the
time was that she thought rivals were
attempting to force her to sell it.
Walter Deam. a Denver mining en

machinery to be used in pumping out
the old shafts and tunnels and to pre
pare the mine for new operations.

"The German dead lie in heaps
around us. It has been thus for sev
eral days. At times we are obliged
to move our machine guns back twen
ty to thirty yards as the German dead
were piled o hiph as to interfere with
our fire. We shot them down as they
jumped over their comrade' bodies.
We are now resting but are always
ready to begin again to show the Ger
mans that the French soldiers are
their masters."

London. March 4. The driv
ing: German assault on Verdun

m the Douaumont sector north
east of Verdun, on this occasion
in the face of a formidable counter-attack
by the French in an
effort. to retake Douaumont vil

French attack on the village and
the German lines adjoining it
was "repulsed partly in close
range fiffhting."
Heavy Proodl Losses.
The cUsh of the opposing itrmios at
this point ha.s evidently been of the
most desperate character. Berlin
mentions heavv losses sustained by the
French and the capture if more than
one thousand prihoners. The number
of cannon taken by the Germans since
Kct.ruarv 22, ha reached a total of
11B. with 161 marhii.e sun3.
The Douaumont f.eetor is pointed
out by French militao Titics as a key
position essential to the German pur
pose of takinK the fortress.
The importance of the German -tivitioE
in other sectors is not over
tooked, however. There have been
advances on both tho French flanks
and indications are furnished of con
templated thrusts at vital points In the
lines about the curving front, such an
on the northwest line, where the dom
inating height of Le Mort Homme ha
been under the fire of German heavy
guns.

nary to a grand assault on Fort De
Vaux. just south of the village.
The French were driven out of
Douatsmont village after desperat
fighting that began Wednesday night
anl continued foi more than 24 hours.
Probably no mere furious struggle ha
been ranged in the history of the war
than for possession of a little Kroup
of less than 75 houses. The town's Im
portance lay in the fact that it wael
the intersecting point of three high
ways. Pombs Illuminate Field.

gray column of Germans cam

time another gray column advanced

their lines and the Germans fell back.
During the night the Germans
brought up masses of reserves. t

regiments renewed the assault against
Douaumont
The Germans succeeded in reach inT

melted away.
