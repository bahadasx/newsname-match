BOMBARDMENT LAST NIGHT.
Paris,
March 4.—Bombardment
continued witli considerable activi
ty last night in the various sectors
In the region of Verdun. It was
not, however, followed by any ac
tions of Infantry, according to an
announcement by the war office
here. At Epanjes, the French
prevented the German troops from
occupying the crater made by an
explosion of one of their mines.
The customary artillery Are has
continued along the remainder of
the front.
Afte# desperate battling on the
Douaumont plateau in the renewal
of the German drive for Verdun,
there has come a second halt In the
Intense struggle. It is reported that
there has been a cessation of in
fantry attacks by the crown prince's
troops, although his artillery still
Is continuing a heavy bombardment.
The continuation of the artillery ac
tivity may Indicate a speedy re
newal of the Important front north
east of the fortress, where the
French lines form the salient.
IMPORTANT POSITION.
The Douaumont sector is pointed
out by French military critics as
the key to the position and essen
tial tothe German purpose of .tak-j*
tag the fortress. Hence the des
perate. n*tur^„«t the struggle which,
has been going on for Its possession.
The .Importance of German activi
ties in other sectors Is not over
looked, however.
ADVANCE ON BOTH FLANKS.
There have been advances on both
French flanks, as Indications fur
nished of the contemplated thrusts
at vital points In the lines about the
curving front, such as the north
west line, where the dominating
height of Lc Mort Homme has been
under Ore of German heavy guns
for some days. Confidence in the
outcome of the Verdun struggle has
been expressed by General Gallieni,
the French minister of war, accord
ing to a Parts dispatch.
FRENCH CLAIM ADVANTAGE.
The French, it is declared in
these dispatches, retain the ad
vantage in the Douaumont sector,
despite the fact that they were
driven out of the village, as the
German position In the town is
dominated by French artillery.
The probability Is that the village
will frequently change hands dur
ing the course of the fighting as the
two forccs at this point appear
evenly matched.
ENEMY REPULSED.
Berlin. Morch 4.—"The enemy*
was repulsed in an effort to retake
Donamount," the war office an-'
nounced. Also it is stated that the
booty taken by the Germans slnoe
February 22, had Increased to 115
large cannon and 161 machine

MANY OFFICERS TOO
YOUNG SAYS SPRAGUE
Ships of United States Navy Often
Manned by Men That Have Not
Enough Responsibility.
New York, March 4.—Ships of tt1"
United States navy "frequently are
manned by officers much too young,
asserted Frank Sprague, a member of
the naval consulting board, in an ad
dress here last night to members of
the National Special Aid society.
Mr. Sprague, who recently return
ed from a month's cruise with the
Atlantic fleet, added that a vessel
worth $15,000,000 or more often was
left in charge of an officer twenty-Ave
or twenty-six years old. He said he
did not wish to detract in any way
from the ability of the young officers
of the navy, but that from an engi
neers' viewpoint it "was not good
practice" to place him in positions of
such responsibility.
Mr. Sprague declared the navy is
in need not only of more battleships,
but also torpedo boat destroyers and
submarines. A much larger number
Jf trained men should be on hand
/86w,
he said.
Fifty per cent of the young men of
the country would be greatly benefit
ed, Mr. sprague concluded, by spena
Ipg a year or two in the navy.

"CALLING HOGS"
This Contest will Play Im

Boys Encampment.
Fort Worth, Texas, March 4.—A
contest In the gentle art of calling
hogs will be one of the events of
prime importance during the Boys
Encampment School of the National
Feeders and Breeders show, here
March 13 to 18.
The boy with a "fine voice for call
ing hogs" will come into his own dur
ing this livestock pageant, for hog
calling contests will have a leading
place on the school's program. They
will be participated in by the several
hundred members of the boy's pig
and baby-beef clubs of Texas, who
complement the encampment school,
and will be actual tests of the lung
and pursuasive powers of the entrants.
Prizes will be offered to those who
can make the hogs respond quickest
to their calls.
The strong-voiced lad will have a
mucl\ better opportunity to win a
prize than he who possesses a deli
cate, lyric tenor, or whose voice is
going through the metamorphic stage
of "changing." Expert hog men as
sert the stentorian shout is much bet
ter for hog calling than a well-modu
lated and musical hail*
The contests will, be held in the
Coliseum arena, where the. hogs will
be turned loose. It Will be the prov
ince of the entrants .vocally to per
suade' the porkers to return to their
respective owners or masters.

:'J'
The Herald ha^fobtained an Eng
lish translation rJf the Normanden
article, which folios:
The most dangerous political ma
chine in North .Dakota today is the
Non-Partisan league. It is dangerous,
because, in its management, it repre
sents the most e^freme case of boss
ism known to the/apolitical history of
the state because*& makes use of all
the tricks, underiUtnded tactics and
arbitrary method# peculiar to that
brand of politics 'because it is sailing
under false colors by means of which
it has grown numerically strong and
also obtained an lrbmense capital that
can be used at fine pleasure of'the
self-constituted leaders, who, appar
ently, are responsible to no one.
The Non-Partissii league is not only
the most dangerois political power
in the state It.is/.t the present time
the strongest. Quietly the .organizers
set to work, an)i .as qufetly their
agents spread ovvr the state, until
Anally the leaders, of the league con
sidered themselves strong enough to
come out in the .open as a political
power. The numb tr of members was
so great, that it is evident that the
league was to be rxekoned with if the
right men were bhin4 the organize*
tion. Political parties, candidates and
^spirants for offices »ere duped and
scared out of boots, and the
.nempapers 4eciA«& feither- to atfait
further develop n*hts -or they meekly
Joined the?: band #agog to bask in the
sunshine of popularity surrounding
the new movement.!
From a progressive point of view
there at first was so real reason to
look upon this movement with dis
pleasure. The only thing about it
which might have been viewed with
suspicion was the secretive methods
employed by the paid agents of the
organization. But that could, of
course, be explained in various ways,
and the majority of the people were
inclined to let It go at that. It is
safe to say that the Non-Partisan
league up till the present time has
enjoyed the active and moral support
of progressive people all over the
state, re'gardless of political parties
and factional leanings.
Latety, however, there have floated
to the surface several things which
tend to show that everything is not
as It should be within the league.
There is reason to believe that the
leaders, whoever they may be, do not
intend to act in good faith towards
the members. Their manner of pro
ceeding too often taste of gang poli
tics, and they do not come out In the
open, not even as far as their own
members are concerned. Secretive
ness in politics is just what the Amer
ican people have fought all these
years—that, and bossism. If wo shall
leave to a few men to manage our
political affairs, then it makes no dif
ference In the long run If the bosses
are named Tom, Dick or Harry.
Out in full view and broad day
light must be brought every great
issue, if It really shall be of benefit
to the people, it must be debated
from every point and weighed on the
scales of common sense and public
opinion and pass if it shall come up
to the expected standard. That is not
always an easy road to the goal, but
a cause that cannot come out vic
torious through such paths is scarcely
deserving of victory. This has been
proven sormany times
When Normanden now warns the
electors of North Dakota not to follow
the Non-Partisan league blindly and
meekly .sanction everything its leaders
may see fit to decide upon it is well
aware of the responsibility it shoul
ders. It also knows Its stand in this
matter will create surprise and even
disappointment in many quarters but
it has always been the principle of
this newspaper to tell the truth, such
as it sees it, regardless of conse
quences. The policies of Normanden
have never been dictated from per
«onal or pecuniary gain. The Nor
manden has always been a spokesman
for equity, co-operation and the inter
ests of fanners in general. A twenty
nine years' record along these lines
cannot easily be explained away.
The information which the Nor
manden possesses regarding the Non
partisan league is of such a nature
that it would be nothing less than
journalistic deception to keep still.
Those of the readers of this paper
who are members of the league—and
there are many of them—are respect
fully requested to read this with as
unprejudiced a mind- as is possible
under the circumstances, and this

ARBITRATION OF

St Paul, March 4.—The at Piaul
Association of Oonunereai
London, March 4.—Few things short of an actual military victory
could have given the press greater satisfaction than President Wil
son's victory in the American senate. Hie Manchester Guardian re
marks historically that Germany, having failed to convince the United
States, apparently will ignore sentiment in that country. It continues:
"Germany has now deflnitely assumed the line that she is within
her rights and means to abide by the consequences. If American citi
zens lose their lives, she will make no apology or promise or amend
ment."
Hie Guardian says it cannot imagine that Americans will accept
"such a reversion to absolute barbarism," and therefore regards the de
cision of the senate as having the greatest significance.
BERLIN SAYS PARIS REPORTED THE
SINKING Of PROVOKE WITH BUT
1,800 MEN ON BOARD 696 SAVED
Berlin, March 4.—The sinking of two French auxiliary cruisers,
and one British patrol boat by German submarines was announced by
the admiralty.
The announcement also says that from Paris is reported the sink
ing of the transport Provence, "which carried 1,800 men, of whom
only 696 were rescued."
From Paris last night came the report that there were "nearly 4,
000 men on board the French auxiliary cruiser Provence, when she
was sunk In the Mediterranean on February 26."
Previously, It had been reported that about 870 men had been
saved, which would Indicate, If last night's report is true, that upwards
of 3,180 lives were lost.
Absolutely no report came from Paris today, except the indirect
word from Berlin. Last night. It was reported that French censors
were "sitting down hard" on dispatches. This may be the case today.
If last night's reports are true, the sinking of the Provence repre
sents the greatest ocean disaster in modern times, so far as loss of life
Is concerned.
No details of the sinking or of the rescue of men are available
to the news-reading world.

UNNECESSARILY
Ammunition Boxes are Lin
ed Just Because it is an
Old System.
Paris, March 4.—(Correspondence
of The Associated Press)—The parlia
mentary committee on economy,
which has been investigating ways
and means of saving money in the
public service, tells in its latest report
how a member of the committee was
one day struck by the fact that all the
ammunition sent to the front was
packed in zinc-lined boxes. The at
tention of M. Thomas, minister of mu
nitions, was called to the fact, and he
suggested that inquiries should be
made at the front. If the zinc was
superfluous it would be suppressed.
Two members of the committee ac
cordingly followed a box of cartridges
from Vincennes up to the front
trenches, but failed to find out where
the zinc was necessary. They consult
ed everybody enroute from generals
and colonels down to privates, but
without result. At last the general
commanding the Fifth Army solved
the puzzle—the zinc was used, he said,
merely because it had been used for
the last sixty years.
The committee communicated this
information to Minister Thomas, who
at once issued instructions that no
more zinc-lining was to be put Into
ammunition boxes. The saving will
amount to a million and a half dollars
a year.

The House Rules Body Gets
Ready to Table M'Lemore
Resolution.
DECLARE VICTORY
IS DECISIVE ONE
Leaders Confident of Win
ning in House—Many
Representatives Away.
Washington. March 4.—House
leaders decided not to bring the
armed ship question up for a vote
until Monday. Aroused by the pub
lication ol' reports yesterday that
President Wilson is considering re
signing from oflice, the white house
Issued this formal statement:
"When Secretary Tumulty's at
tention was called to. the story ap
pearing in certain papers, that the
president had resigned or was con
sidering resigning, he said:
'An American newspaper that
would publish a story of that kind
in a situation like the one which
now confronts America, dishonors
itself.'"
Majority Leader Kitchin, shortly
after noon, began notifying house
members that, they would not be
needed to vote on the armed ship
question until next Tuesday at the
earliest.
PREPARE TO KILL IT.
The postponement first was from
today to Monday, and then with
the arrangements under way for
Tuesday, it is indicated that Presi
dent Wilson's fight to dispose of the
armed ship agitation in congress
may be extended unexpectedly. The
house ruls committee met late this
afternoon to frame a rale to table
the McLemore resolution to warn
Americans off armed shlpa of 15a
ropean.-belligerents^. The nde irillr i
be brought in probably Tuesday
when the administration forces
plan to dispose of it by a substantial
majority.
AGREE OX RESOLUTION.
The foreign affairs committee al
ready has agreed on the resolu
tion. Hie administration forces
plan that action to table the Mc
Lemore resolution will include a
declartion that the president shall
handle diplomatic affairs without
congressional Interference. Leaders
say they are confident that they
liave enough votes to make their
victory complete.
Leaders explained that the post
ponement was agreed upon because
of the absence of so many members
on week-end trips. Many left yes
terday under the impression that
the present session today, which
began at 10 o'clock, was to end at
noon, and would consider .snlv claim
bills.
Replying to the claims of a mixed
victory in the senate yesterday and
to the contentions of the anti-ad
ministration forccs that the senate
evaded voting on tabling the Gore
resolution itself, through the per
plexed parliamentary situation, ad
ministration leaders pointed to the
official congressional record of the
senate proceedings. A vote was
taken on the following by Senator
James of Kentucky:
"1 move that the resolution and
all substitutes for it, and amend
ments to it. be laid upon the table
and upon that motion. I demand the
yeas and nays."
CLEAN-CtT VICTORY.
Upon his motion the senate voted.
It carried 68 to 14. and by that ma
jority the senate decided there will
be no legislation whatever on the
question of warning Americans off
armed ships.
The leaders pointed to the record
today to bear evidence that their
victory is clean-cut and complete.
The decision of the house leaders to
postpone the vote readied without
consultation with the president,
confused the situation.
It is said the white house Is op»
posed to postponing the action.
