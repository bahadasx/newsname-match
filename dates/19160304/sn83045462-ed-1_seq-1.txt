INFANTRY ATTACKS
OF GERM AN FORCES
HAVE COME TO HALT
Second Lull in Desperate Battle
for Verdun on Douaumont
Plateau.
REPULSE FOR FRENCH
CLAIMED BY BERLIN
Violent Bombardment Continues
Prom West of Meuse to
WoevTe Region.

Teutonic Thrusts at Vital Points
Expected?Present Conflict May
Have Far-Beaching Effect
on Neutrals.
LONDON, March 4.?After
the desperate battling on the
Douaumont plateau in the renewal
of the German drive for
Verdun, there has come a second
halt in the intense struggle.
l'ari> today announces that there
has been a cessation of infantry
attacks by the crown prince's
troops, although his artillery is
still keeping up a heavy bombardment.
"The enemy was repulsed in an
effort to retake Douaumont."' the
Berlin war office announced today,
but this attack evidently refers
to the fighting of yesterday,
in which the French claim to
. have occupied the highest part of
the mound on the northern slope
of which the village of Douaumont
is situated. Paris also
claims that in counter attacks
against the Germans the F'rench
regained ground in the immediate
vicinity of Douaumont.
Bombardment Violent.
The bombardment continues very violent
along the entire front from the
west of the Meuse to the Woevre
region.
The continuation of artillery activity
may inuicaic a uprcuj iciirwai ui iur
action on the important front northeast
of the fortress where the French
lines form a salient. The importance
of the German activities in other sectors
is not overlooked, however. There
have been advances on both the French
flanks, and indications are furnished of
contemplated thrusts at vital points in
the lines about the curving ftont, such
*s on the northwest line, where the
dominating height of I^e Mort Homme
has been under the fire of German
heavy guns for some days.
Satisfied With Situation.
Gen Gallieni. French minister of war.
has told the commission on military
aft. : s of the chamber of deputies that
he is satisfied with the situation at
\ rutin. He gave details of the re-er
ves of men and stocks of ammuni;
?ri now available.
Military writers say that it was in
keeping with all the precedents that
the Germans should attempt to reduce
the salient of Douaumont plateau, for
this key position must be taken before
solid progress could be made elsewhere.
The attack began after a long preliminary
bombardment Wednesday. German
columns started to deploy from
Hardauamont wood, on the right, and
at the same time a division advanced
on mf viuage or \aux. XJie latter attack
failed, with heavy losses to the
Germans.
Bring TJp Reserves.
The French artillery Are was so
fierce that evening that the Germans
were unable to push attack on any
point of the Douaumont plateau. They
profited of the night, however, to
bring up masses of reserves, and the
fighting began with renewed fury
Thursday. rhirlng the morning and
the afternoon three desperate onslaughts
were made by Pomeranian
and Brandenburg regiments
Tn the first and second attacks the
assailants, who fought with great
bravery, reached the French barbed
wire,, but so fierce was the hall of bullets
from the machine guns and rifles
that the gray-coated legions melted
away. The officers rallied them again
and again until no rnor* were left tc
rally. The third attack began about 2
o'clock in the afternoon. It was even
more violent than those which hav?
preceded. For more than an hour ?h
Germans came on in serried ranks
hurling themselves, regardless of cost
against the ridges held by the Frenchmen.
At last the defenders' line wavered
at two points, but only momentarily,
and the counter attack, driven
home with the bayonet, drove the Germans
back to the shelter of the chambrettes
of the Hardaumont ravines.

The Germans then resumed the bombardmerit,
plowing up the ground
arid pulverizing the rocks with hundreds
of big shells. The fourth advance
was made after dusk by fresh
Prussian brigades, who had replaced
the troops engaged in the morning an<j
afternoon attacks. Afte?- desperate
fighting they managed to get a footing
on the extreme edge of the plateau
whence they pushed forward into tht
houses on the north side of the village

likely that the village will changt

that the technical advantage remain:

unbroken.

RESIGNATION TALE
5 APLOIISHINTED
o Intimated at White House
That It Is a Part of Wide
Conspiracy.
PRESIDENT'S NERVE FIRM;
S NO NOTION OF QUITTING
y Thinks Country Understands Senate
Vote and Regards Himself Now
as Free Handed.
v It was intimated at the White
0 House today that the story
?s printed in several cities that
>cj President W ilson is contemplating
resigning his office, owing to
;c the complications and worries of
a the international situation, is believed
to be part of the organized
-s propaganda that is openly charged
in many directions.
tg There has been strong suspicion at
n the White House for many days that
_e a publicity propaganda, designed to
j_ embarrass and cripple the President
lg at every possible stage of his troubles
y with Germany, exists; is well fortified
financially and otherwise, and will be
manifest at every step taken by the
White House in the future.
,y Secretary Tumulty's View.
is
President Wilson himself said nothie
ing today on the subject, but Secretary
d Tumulty made the following comment:
"An American newspaper that would
Lt publish a story of that kind In a situ
ation like the one which now confront*
ie America dlahonora line If."
Tbe story was first printed in a New
York newspaper yesterday afternoon
" and reprinted in several other papers
l~ this morning:. Today there were re,2
ports that the President is alleged to
a have given intimations of this kind to
e' Senator Stone. Representative Flood
y and others.
Health and Nerves Good.
President Wilson's intimate friends
y said today that anybody who circulated
a story of that kind did not know
the stuff of which the President is
made; had not the slightest conception
8 of his moral fiber and tenacity of purt
pose. It was represented that the
President, even if in serious health.
n would stick to the job he has set out
a to perform until the last strength had
5v left him. But he is in good health,
his nerves are known- by his intimate
friends to be calm and collected; he
y rides a great deal in the fresh air and
plays golf at every opportunity. Nat-r
urally the strain upon him is great.
but his will and his nerve will enable
him to hold his own, it is declared on
competent authority.
ls If the President is disgusted and an>
noyed over the alleged propaganda
n stories, he was heartened today by the
n receipt of hundreds of telegrams from
every part of the country congratulatld
ing him on the vote in the Senate yesterlay.
These telegrams uniformly
l" praised his Americanism and courage
t and set him in the same class with
* Washington. Jackson and Lincoln. The
' senders urged him now that he has a
free hand, to pursue the course he has
r_ been following.
? Thinks Country Understands.
The White House was also gratified
today by the belief that the country
ir has not misunderstood the meaning of
Lo the Senate vote. Outside of Washing,0
ton the impression, from the telegrams.
>r seems to have been unanimous that
l- the Senate, despite the complications
i- injected at the last minute by Senator
>r Gore, meant to give the President a
free hand in his international work and
did so. The country has evidently
? reached the same conclusion, if the
many telegrams represent public senti|
merit.
Whatever the country believes, however.
it is clearly known and under!
stood that the President will proceed
i1 from now on with a firmer hand and
will continue to stand by his position
that Germany will not sink, without
warning, defensively armed pas
senger or merchant vessels. with
Americans on board, unless she wants
| to invite a break with the I'nited
I States.
Regards Hands as Free.
The President told the country that
he stood for compliance with international
rules, and that the administration
would back its position on that
question by for^e, if necessary. He
asked Congress to decide whether he
was to be allowed to continue along
those lines. He understands that Congress
has gi\en him a free hand and he
is going to accept the responsibilities
imposed upon him.
The President today feels that if
Germany has not fully <aught the
I spirit of the warning that is conveyed
in the whole transaction, then she does
not want to get it; that she is bent on
submarining in all directions without
care or concern for the interests of
Americans or of humanity generally.
He awaits Germany's next move and
then it will be his.

SflTIATE. Mass.. March 4. -Two
light coal barges, the Ashland and
Kohinoor, which broke adrift from the
tug Swatara. in tow for Philadelphia,
were wrecked last night on Minots
light ledges. Five men, the crew of
the Kohinoor, were lost, while five men
aboard the Ashland were washed
ashore ori the deckhouse early today
and hauled through the breakers to
safety.
The North Scituate coast guard pickled
up an exhausted man from the
Kohinoor, who died before the surfboat
landed. The bodies of Capt. Ira
Montgomery of Philadelphia and other
members of the Kohinoor's crew had
not been recovered this forenoon.
Tug Encounters Gale.
The tug encountered a gale soon after
leaving Koston harbor. The towing
hawser parted, and the barges fetched
up on the ledges, the Kohinoor going
to pieces almost immediately.
Capt. Estrand of the Ashland said the
Swatara with her remaining barge, the
Kimberton, probably kept on to Provincetown.
The barges were owned by

UOM&, March 4, via Paris, 1:10 p.m.
?William F. Kelley. the American

today that in addition to three woman
candidates nominated the name of Mrs.
Bird K. Hobdy of K1 Centro had been

VARIANCE IN VIEW
OF SENATE ACTION
Supporters of Original "Warning"
Resolution Say Issue
Is Left in Air.
ADMINISTRATION LEADERS
SATISFIED WITH RESULT
Point to Wording of James' Motion
to Support Claim of CleanCut
Victory.
While supporters of the original
Gore resolution to warn Americans off
armed merchant vessels of belligerent
powers continued to insist today that
the vote taken in the Senate on tabling
the amended Gore resolution has left
| the issue in the air, supporters of the
I President on both sides of the chamber
j declared that the Senate's action could
j not be confused because of technical
I parliamentary entanglements.
The opponents of the Gore warning
resolution said that the weakness of
j the support of that resolution was manI
ifested clearly by the very act of Senj
ator Gore in amending his resolution
i at the last moment so as to change its
meaning. They asserted that the Senate
would have overwhelmingly voted
to table the warning resolution as originally
drafted had Senator Gore permitted
it to come 'to a vote.
Point to Record of the Vote.
To claims of a mixed victory in the
Senate yesterday and to contentions of
the anti-administration forces that the
Senate evaded voting on tabling the
Gore resolution itself, through a complexed
parliamentary situation, the admiriiotputinn
l?ttodav uointed to
the official Congressional Record of the
Senate proceedings.
? ?,?_ ?.,c? yjii the following motion
by Senator .James:
"I move that the resolution, and all
substitutes for it. and amendments to
it, be-laid upon the table, and upon
that motion I deniano uie c^s ....u j
nays."
l'non that motion the Senate voted
and it was carried. 6S to 14. and by !
that majority the Senate decided there
. ...? .egisiation whatever on
the question of warning Americans off
armed ships.
The leaders pointed to the Record
today to bear evidence that their victory
was clean-cut and complete.
They pointed out that while tabling
the amended resolution, declaring that
the sinking of an armed merchant vessel
of an enemy power with American
citizens aboard by a Herman submarine
would l>e cause for war, the Senate also
bad laid on the table the McCumber
substitute, which clearly contained a
warning to American citizens not to
travel on armed merchantmen while
the issue between this government and
Hermany Va.? still unsettled.
View of President's Supporters.
Senator James of Kentucky, Senator
[ Simmons of North Carolina and other
! administration supporters said, therefore.
there would be no further action
by the Senate in the matter unless a
J warning resolution should be introduced
and called up again, and that if
such a resolution did come before the
Senate it would be again voted down
overwhelmingly. Senator McCumber
of North l>akota reintroduced his reso- i
lution yesterday afternoon as an original
resolution, and it is possible that
in the. future he may demand a vote
on it.
The Senate took a recess, however. 1
last evening, and the business before
it today when it assembled was the ,
Shields dam site bill. L'nder the rules ;
of the Senate, unless this bill is dis- !
placed by a vote or laid aside by
unanimous consent nothing else can
Come before the Senate today.
Attempt to Gag Alleged.
Criticism was heaped upon the I'resi- J
dent's supporters in the Senate because
they had attempted to "gag" i
the Senate by a motion to table the
Core resolution. Senator Borah of
Idaho. Senator Cummins of Iowa and
Senator Norris of Nebraska were outspoken
in their denunciation of the
tactics of the administration supporters.
As a matter of fact, the tactics
employed did not succeed in shutting
off debate after the vote on the motion
to table had been had. Senators discussed
the matter until far into the
afternoon.
Senator Kail, a republican, said:
i i?? vwui nun iwuav \uu i:av? seni
jto the kaiser, if you have done anyI
thins, notice tliat the Senate of tlie
United States will look upon his sinking
of armed merchant ships and the
[death of an American citizen probably
with some degree of regret, but that no
action would be taken against him."
Senator Kern Defends Action.
On the other hand. Senator Kern, the
majority leader, upheld the action, asserting
that it would proclaim to all
nations that the President, in exercising
his constitutional powers in the
conduct of negotiations, spoke "not for
himself, not for his party, but for all
the people of his country, who are prepared
to back him with their lives in
an insistence on American rights."
Senator Xorris of Nebraska accused
the senators who had spoken during
the day of explaining their votes in an
effort to satisfy their constituents,
after voting to satisfy the President,
whom he* termed "the heao of the pie
counter."
"If a few more confessions are made
here the President will have a real expression
of the sentiment of the Senate,"
he said. "If you count the confessions,
you will find the senators believe
in warning citizens from armed
ships; if you count their votes, you
will find they support the President!"
Senator Xorris added that "friends of
the Gore resolution are the hopes for
peace for the nation, and the only
danger of war comes from the policy of
the President in opposing a warning
resolution."
SaymFew Understood Resolution.
Senator Cummins declared that few
in the Senate knew the meaning of the
Gore resolution or the way it had been
amended when they voted.
It was the most indefensible interference
with the right of debate and
opportunity for intelligent consideration
1 have ever seen." he said. "There
are two ways of shutting off discussion,
one a motion to table as witnessed
this morning, and one for the senators
to absent themselves."

The House today refused to
take an immediate vote on the
proposal to table the McLemore
resolution warning American citizens
off armed belligerent merchant
ships. Xo vote will be
taken before Tuesday.
After a morning full of changes
of decision on the part of leaders,
it is now impossible for the President
to get a vote on the proposi
tion on which he insisted in lus
recent letter to Representative
Ron until Tuesday afternoon
at the earliest. The confusion
of the past week was outdone a
score of times bv the utter chaos
of the early hours around the
Capitol today, until Leader
Kitchin told members that they
could leave the city this afternoon
and not fear that a vote would
be taken until they returned early
next week.
Press for Immediate Action.
Representative Kitchin and members
of the House rules committee came to
the conclusion early this morning: not
to allow a rule to be brought out forcing
an immediate vote on the recommendation
of the House foreign affairs
committee to place the McLemore resolution
before the House and then vote
to lay it on the table. Coupled with
this recommendation was the suggestion
which came from the administration
side to limit debate as much as
possible.
After this decision not to^bring in a
rule today there was a rush of administration
men to demand immediate action.
A hasty conference was held in
the Speakers office, ami the only ray
of light arising therefrom was that a
desperate effort is being made to bring
in a rule that will permit a vote on
the merits of the McLemore resolution.
| and to find something that will gain
j for the administration the greatest
possible number of votes.
No Vote Until Tuesday.
The conference he-Id in Speaker
(.'lark's office adjourned with no formal
action except a decision to hold a
rules committee meeting at 2 o'clock
today. A so-called gentleman's agreement
was made not to have a vote before
Tuesday.
Speaker Clark was opposed to a vote
Monday, as it would interfere with tfce
unanimous consent calendar.
Reports of a special rule to give the
House an opportunity to vote on the
straight warning issue instead of
tabling the McLemore resolution were
circulated. Majority Leader Kitchin
said such a move had been discussed.
Such action would not be disagreeable
to the President.

noon, began notifying members that
they would not be needed to vote until
next Tuesday at the earliest.
Dissatisfied With Report.
Coupled with the move of the House
foreign affairs committee yesterday is
a report which is said to be not entirely
to the liking of all the administration
men in the House. The report was
the subject of animated conferences today.
It was learned late in the day that
the administration leaders fear a heavy
vote against the adoption of the special
rule, and that one of the big stats
delegations will cast almost its entire
strength against euch a rule. If the
rule is defeated, it would simply take
out of the House any chance to vote on
the McLemore resolution, and would
mean that the House refuses to give
the President any expression on the
matter in any way at all. As the day
progressed this possibility was discussed
more and more.
President Not Consulted.
The decision of House leaders today
to postpone a vote until Tuesday was
reached without consultation with tha
Preaident and confused the situation.
It was said the White House was opposed
to postponing action.
There also was some objection from
some of the administration adherents.
Chairman Flood of the foreign affairs
committee, all the members of the rulas
committee and many of the leaders
gathered in Speaker Clark's office to
discuss the situation.
Acting Chairman Pou of the rplas
committee at the beginning of tha
conference said the situation was in
doubt.
