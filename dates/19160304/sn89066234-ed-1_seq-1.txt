Those were ga-lorlous days ror

of it. now that Mr. Hutton I n
longer here to puataht, I do not
know,
B it let US return to the free
books. There are hundreds of
families In Bcott county who can
ill afford to buy school books for
their children and It u the poor
who generally have the greatest
number of children The cost of
books, together with the ei st of
suitable clothing, keeps many a
child from school.
It is the duty of society the
state to see that no child grows
up In ignorance. But the state is
performing this duty ns it per
forms all other duties toward
the weaker ones. We have a com
pulsory school law, but nobody
pays any attention to it. Free
bot ks is the entering wedge a
ecotrultion of the duty that socle
ty owes to the child, When this
idea la developed it will Include
clothing and wholesome food.
Millions of children are not In
school because their parents are
,.., tn nrnvlde hooks and
clothing And other millions go!

that cause them to fee' hum UlO t

Bo lets begin c,n the
books, l have before me a pnm
piet which makes the method of
adopting free books very elei '
and from hlch 1 will quote :
Question What is the Free
Textbook f.aw?
Answer The -Cross ey-or " Fret
Textbook Law was enacted bj
the 1018 Oenaral Assembly, Ir
provides that school districts
which furnish free to the children
in tl e elementary grades all text
books necessary for tin it
s' a 1 be entitled to a certain :
.if the Foreign Insurance tu
moneys,
Q( Where dues this mone,i c
from, and what u the amount
A. The ForeiB!- Wfe and Fire
Insurance Companies doing busi
ness in Missouri pay as a tax to
the state 2 per cent of nil pn -luma
collected on Insuranoe poll
l ies. One-half of the total
amount of this tax is apportli :i
to the severai counties. The n nil
tier of school children of s ho
age in the county la the basis used
to determlna how much monc,
each county gets,
Tie Annual apportionment ol
this Insurance Tax by the state
is from 8800,000 to 8825.000, An
average county receives about
$2,500 a year.
q ..-Hoes this money now go to
the schoo! distrl its?
A. It does no.. The County
Court apportions to each clt; ai
town the amo. .at it is entitled t

of the money goes Into the gen
era) fund or the county. The
"C'ross'ey-Ori"' Free Textbook
Law makes this money available
Cor the purpose of furnishing
books for the free use of pupils in
rural and city schools.
q. How may a school district
get this money to buy school
books
A. The School Board must sub

The question may be submitted

A. The amount distrlbuti

umerated throughout the state
In 1012, 81.2 cen s In 1013 88.17
cents; In 1914,3.1 cents per child
enumerated
Any district voting for free
textbooks will draw the per capl
ta amount for each child of school
age in the district. Books are re
quired only for those in actual at
tendance. For instance if there are fifty
children in the district and the
amount available is thirty-foui
cents, the district would get $17.
Aa only about one-half the child
ren are in school, and only about
two-thirds of these are in the

RAILWAYS SCARED UP.
Their Publicity Agents Busy Trying
to Prejudice Public Against Men
The Kicker was in error Inst
week In saying that the railroad
employes wou
lliake their de
mands for an Blfftlt hour day this
month I should have said in May
The railroads are already busy
with their campaign of publicity
to prejudice the public against
the workers In every state they
have publicity agents and pics
bureaus to furnish "copy' to the
kept newspapers whose editors
trne: on "edltoral mileage.1' ai
the stuff appears as original

The misinformation sent out by
these railroad press agents l

with Bconomlc conditions, and ti..

Luke Grant was an chip oye of
( the Industrial Commission, b it h -pay
stopped last July, and that
elided Ilia services as a public em
ploye Now the railroads have
captured him and are using him,
The Kicker read the article by
I Luke rant and found that it con
tained a great truth. -The rail
roads are to the life of the ci. in
try what the blood arteries arc
to the human body' say s Mr
Li rant.
That is true, And I am sorry :
hac not Mr. Qrant her' to ask
him a question, i would like to
aiik him how it would s iit him to
have the biixid arteries of his
body privately owned by barna
cles and parasites that had no
other interest in his body except
to rob it of its vitality'.'
Railroads are to a state landsna-
tion what dirt roads arc to a
community. There is as much
reason for the private ownership
of one as there is for the other
Country roads used to be private
ly owned in some sections. But
the people have outgrown that
And they are outgrowing the pri
vate ownership of the railroads
The railroads are also circulating
a pamphlet by "Luke Grant, Spe
cial Agent United States Indus
trial Commission.'1 When the at
tention of Chairman Walsh, of the
Commission was called to it, he
said :
"Grant is not an agent of the
Industrial Commission and has

That ihe railway employes are
