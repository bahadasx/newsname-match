Questions of general interest

the hog law and the cost of fence

a number of the citiz;,s, of ward

Payne. W. R. Jones, and others.
It is requested that all ci:izens of
ward 7 come out and help in the
discussion and give us your fair
opinion of this subject.
Clover Bloat in Cattle.
Last season there was a con
siderable amount of bloating in
cattle as the result of a luxuriant
growth of succulent white clover,
and the animals being turned on
it with free access to it without
revious and gradual preparation.
r rous inquiries already t
received, a d ndition may c
reasonably be anticip this '
spring unless cattle owners fake
the necessary care to prevent it.
A sudden change from dry feed I
after the winter season to a green I
succulent feed of any kind is li
able to cause bloating of cattle.
This is particularly liable to occur
when grazing on white clover,
when it is young and green, or
when it is in full bloom. It rap
idly ferments in the paunch, and
the gas there produced causes
distension of this large stomach
on the left side of the animal,
with the characteristic appear
ance, and general train of symp
toms, familiar to most cattle men.
According to Dr. W. H. Dal
rymple of the department of vet
erinary science, L. S. U., pre
ventive measures always giye the
most satisfactory results in ward
ing off this condition. JWhen first
turning cattle on clover, it should
be done gradually until the di
gestive organs become accustom
ed to the change; and the safest
way is not to permit them to eat
this succulent feed for longer
than twenty minutes to half an I
hour the first day, and increase I
the length of the period each day
afterwards until it seems to have
lost its bloating effect. It is
safer, also, not to turn the cattle
on to this pasture until the dew
or frost has gone off it. Another
method is to give to all the cattle
some dry feed, such as hay, etc.,
before turning them on the clo
ver, which tends to prevent fer
mentation of the green feed.
After a short while, when the
stomach has accomodated itself
to the change from the dry to
the succulent feed, the animals
may consume large quantities of
the latter without apparent in
convenience.-Live Stock Exten

You Should Trade at
Peoples Cash Store
1. BECAUSE we sell cheaper.
2. BECAUSE we have the largest and the most complete stock in town.
3. BECAUSE we handle only reliable and depenbable merchandise.
4. BECAUSE our method of doing business-quick sales and small prof
its-enables us to buy in large quantities, and, of course, buy cheaper.
5. BECAUSE we pay highest cash prices for chickens, eggs, butter, and
almost anything you have to sell.
6. THE BEST reason of all is because, on account of the close competi
tion caused by the opening of the People's Cash Store four years ago, Colfax is
one of the best towns in the State to market what you have to sell and to buy
your supplies.
A TOWN where it pays you to come for miles to trade, instead of going
miles to other towns to keep from trading.
A TOWN where you can-market all of your produce in a lump for cash at
market prices, instead of running all over town and selling about half, of it by
the dime's worth and carrying the balance back home.
NOW, IN THE FACE OF THESE FACTS, and
many others we could mention, 'don't you think We.
should share at least a iarge toftion of your valued
patronage?

How to Prevent Croup.
When the child is subject to attacks
of croup, see to it that he eats a light

may bring on an attack, also watch for

Why Prince Albert Wins.
Patented Process is Responsible for
Its International Popularity.
Smokers so much appreciate the
flavor and coolness and aroma of Prince
Albert pipe and cigarette tobacco that
they often marvel that this one brand
could be so different from all others.
'The answer to this question is to be
found on the reverse side of every
Prince Albert package, where you will
read: "Process Patented July 30th,
1907." That tells the whole story.
Prince Albert is made by a patented
process that cuts out the bite and parch,
which makes the tobacco so mighty
agreeable and satisfying to men 6f
every taste of every civilized nation on
the globe.
Smokers should realize that this
patented process cost three years~ con
tinuous work and study and a fortund
in money to perfect. But .the result.
has proven to be worth all that was
expended upon it, because it has set
free men who believed they never could
enjoy a pipe or a makin's cigarette. -
Prince Albert makes it possible for
every man to smoke a pipe or to roll
his own cigarettes. And, no mntter
how tender the tongue, Prince Albert
cannot bite or parch. That is cut out
by the patented process, leaving for
the smoker only the joys of the fra
I grant tooacco.
It is a fact that since Prince Albert
S"arrived'.' just about six years ago, it
has made three men smokepipes where
I ae smaked a pipe befor-Adv.'
