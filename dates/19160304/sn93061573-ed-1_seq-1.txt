Diplomatic Situation Sow Desperate
Washington. March I. President
Wilson's position on the internation
al situation as revealed further today
was that he bad tolu roneressional
leaders it was months after the res
ienation of former Secretary of
State Itrvan before the United States
eov eminent could conv ince (erinany
that this nation was in earnest in
its position on sulunarie warfare.
The president is understood to
have mentioned this fact to show
hi belief that action Py congress
; would further weaken the position
of the United Slates abroad.
He is understood to have told the
leaders that charges that he wanted
to plunge the United States into war
were entirely disproved by bis at
titude during the last two years.
Ho endured jeers and ridicule, he
said, because of his efforts to main
tain peace. He is understood to have
declared that he has always been
I willing to do anything except sacri
lleo honor in order to maintain the
United States at peace.
At tho samo timo the president de
clared he did not see how tho Unit
ed States could do anything but sev
1 er diplomatic relations with any na
j tion which killed Americana in vi
olation of international law.

and this was no smalt feat. It be
came necessary to hire an attorney,
for which John H. Williams was en

that si'iiion was saved the lessee year

It. was determined by the State

HIS hi Two Weeks
W
e don't like to bore our readers,"
continuously bragging about our
subscription list but here's the.
whole thing in a nut-shell Our sub
scription list i, in tine shape so
line in fact that it had us bulfalnei)
for a w hile as we have been forced
to work every Sunday since Oetoo-e-in
order to get the mail to subscrib
ers. The arrival tonight of a pieie
of modern mechanism. (he Omaha
Folder will allow the force to at-
tend Sunday school because the ma
chine will deliver the paper printed
and folded - ready for the mail. v
There are four distinct depart
ments in The News plant. The bus- '
mess department, the editorial de
partment, tin job department and
the subscription department. The
last, named has been an ever increas
ing source of annoyance no, we
mean it just try adding II fly names
each week to a mailing list, each
name with a separate address well
it is ipiite some job. Last week .r7
wise folks decided they couldn't get
along without The News and this
week 51 joined the happy throng.'
If anyone is inclined to doubt this
we will have Tim Hoggs, in charge,
of the mailing department, make af
fidavit as to (he niiinncr of names
he set and placed on the mailing
galleys.
Strange to say each and every de
partment of The News pays its way.
because it is our business to have,
men on the job who are experts in
their particular line.
When we ask folks to subscribe
for The News wo do so with no
(ualms of conscience we give' each
and every subscriber three time
the moneys worth in acual, useful
information and we gel It to sub
scribers while it is news because
we have workmen in that depart
ment too w ho sabe.
