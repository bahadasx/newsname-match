150 Members of both the House and'

the admitted that they had doubts wheth
trik- er a requisite force could be enlisted
in the National Guard, even under the
Do- proposed federal pay and regulation
the provisions, and a growing tendency to'

ac- addition to the regular army and fed
ent, eralized National Guard was manifest
lays in both committees . Members said
at they favored a practical test of the
possibility of forming a federal vol
WII. unteer army in peace times on lines
at- somewhat similar to the continental
Sarmy plaan. The apparent intention to
ud abandon the continental project
ler wholly was one of the causes leading
up to the resignation of Secretary
wo Garrison.
the The Senate committee has agreed
wa- tentatively to a plan under which
training camps would be authorized in

a sufficient men volunteered for training
re under an obligation for war service.
The maximum force to be thus raised
Las in any district would be a battalion,

as proposed for the first year of the Gar

camps would be under command of
se full complements of regular army of
