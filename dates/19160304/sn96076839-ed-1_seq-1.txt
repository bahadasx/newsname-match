No. 10
Business Men
To Organize
Will Have Talkfcst and Supper,
Wednesday.
For iie past year the necessity of
getting our business men re-organized
has been felt more and more and this
sentiment finally reached something
tangible when a petition, headed by
Mayor Cross and backed by nearly one
hundred of our business men was pre
sented to our City Commission last
Saturday, asking that body to appoint
s a committee to re-organize the East
Jordan and South Arm Board of Trade.
The Commission appointed as such
committee Messrs W. C. Spring, Harry
E. Potter, M. S. Herger, II. I. McMillan
and R. O. Bisbee.
This committee, organized Monday
night and delegated three of their mem
bers Messrs Merger, Bisbee and Potter
a committee on arrangements.
Since then the Committee have been
busy arranging details for a get-together
meeting of our citizens and this
will be held next Wednesday evening,
March 8th, at the Russell House. ,
PA supper will be served and, with a
ew incidental expenses, will cost each
person the sum of sixty cents. Follow
ing this a program will be given which
is being arranged now. Several mat
ters will be brought up that are of vital
importance to our community interests
and we believe our citizens will need
no urging to be present and take part
in the deliberations.
Remember the date next Wednes
day night, March 8th and make ar
rangements to be there.
GIRL MAKES INTER
ESTING SCRAP BOOK
By "Observer."
You girls who are fond of home
made articles may gather a welcome
idea from what I am going to tell you
about a home-made scrap book that
was recently my pleasure to see, while
visiting in another state.
The owner of the book, a girl twenty
years, is very fond of both pictures
and poetry. Having a camera, she con
ceived the idea of getting up a collec
tion of photos of her own taking to
illustrate favorite quotations from her
favorite poems. When she told me,
on offering the book, what it contained
I wondered where she found scenes in
that community to illustrate lines
written years ago, many of them in
places far distant from her home. But
she had done remarkably well, as I
think you will agree:
The first page of the scrap book
caVricd a picture of a tangled mass of
voodland. Under it the girl had pen
ned the opening lines of Longfellows'
"Evangeline:"
"This is the forest primeval."
A landscape scene, taken on a win
ter day fitted Whittier's "Snowbound."
"The sun that bright December day
Rose cheer less over hill of grey.
The vine-covered school house in
which she had received her education
naturally dear to her memory, had
been photographed and under it were
the lines from Dickens:
"A rare old plant is the ivy green
That twineth o'er ruins old."
A snap shot of her small brother at
play, barefoot and in overalls had ser
ved to illustrate others of Whittier's
lines admirably:
"Blessings on thee, little man,
Barefoot boy with cheeks of tan."
The book contained some twenty or
thirty photos, each illustrating a quota
tion. It was as novel an idea, admir
ably carried out, as anything I have
ever seen, and, since I am a man, I
trust you will pardon me for admitting
I should rather have that scrap book
than the most elaborate piece of Bat
tenburg or tatting ever made.
OF INTEREST
TO FARMERS
(ifk recent issue of Commerce Re
ports, the Department of Commerce
expressed great surprise that the
Netherlands and Switzerland "sold
much larger quantities of milk in the
United States in 1915 than ever before."
Inasmuch as the Democratic tariff law
placed condensed milk on the free list,
ere is nothing surprising about the
fttct that European countries are taking
.advantage of it. However, half our
condensed milk imports are coming
from Canada, who turned down our
reciprocity offer in 1911 and received
free access to our market in 1913.
DIRECTORS HELD
ANNUAL MEETING
The Board of Directors of-the Char
levoix County Agricultural Society
held their annual meeting at the
Russell House, East Jordan, Michigan,
on the 17th day of February, 1916.
Practically a full Board was present,
there being but two absentees.
A special Committee representing
the Board of Supervisors, consisting of
Messrs. Mcech, Miller and Bailey, met
with the Board.

deceased.
The Temporary Finance Committee
reported the total receipts of the year
as amounting to $37.7J.G7 with total ex
penditures of $3710.80, leaving a bal
ance of $42.88 in the treasury.

appointed to succeed him.
The following committee were ap
pointed for the ensuing year:
Executive Committee Price, Ward

being the admission of the Arbors of
the Ancient Order of Gleaners to com
petition with the Granges for premiums
in Divisions G. II. and I., and in
abolishing the limitation clause in
Division II (Fruit displays) so that in
the future instead of being limited to
three hundred plates, the granges and
Arbors may each exhibit an unlimited
number of plates.
The date for the next annual Fair
was left open, pending the action of
the Emmett County Fair Association.
A general discussion was indulged in
over past and future Fairs, resulting in
a determination to make the next
Annual Fair one that will set a new
mark in every department.
The Directors expressed their appre
ciation of the faithful work done by
the retiring secretary Mr. Brintnall,
and regretted his resigning from the
office.
Much enthusiam was apparent and
patrons of the Fair may look forward
to the best County Fair held in north
ern Michigan.
Discouraged Her
A Kansas man says this is one of the
best ones he has heard recently:
"I was on a small Western railroad.
The train was a little more deliberate
than usual on this occasion, and the
only passenger besides myself was a
woman, evidently a stranger on the
line. She was becoming very nervous,
fidgeting about, and every time the
conductor or brakeman passed she
would ask:
"Aren't we ever going to get to
W-?''
"At last the conductor grew tired of
it, and replied rather snappily, "Please,
have a little patience madam. Why,
I've been on this line 3 years "
Before he could finish his sentence
the woman exclaimed:
"My gracious! What station did you
get on at?" Ex.
Old Nursery Rhymes Revamped
"A dillar, a dollar,
A ten o'clock scholar,
You're late again today!"
"That may be so,
But a six-reel show
Would tempt a Saint away."

Jubilee Singers
Coming Thursday
One of Best Colored Companies
on the Platform.
As the last number of the Citizens'
Entertainment Course the famous
Carter Jubilee Singers will appear here
next Thursday evening, March 9th.
This company consists 6f seven persons
who have worked together in lyceum
engagements for many years a id have
all of the finish in their singing that
only long experience can give. The
company was originally organized in
1S82 and the present members have
been together for eleven years.
The program . will consist largely of
the old time songs of plantation and
campmeeting days and will include a
large number of humorous selections
of the kind which can be given success
fully only by a colored company. If
you enjoy the old southern melodies
and the harmony of a high class Jubilee
Company, don't fail to hear this concert.
Prices, 50 and 35 cents; 25 cents for
school children. The reserved seat
board will be at Mack's store next Mon
day morning.
ELBERT BEDE SAYS
If gossip were a crime more men
than women would be in jail for it.
It will probably never go down in
history as the Ford peace party.
Another way of conserving power
would be tq harness the revolution in
Mexico.
The consumer doesn't agree with the
producer about prices having been
forced down.
Dropping is dangerous for eggs
therefore, the decline in price is reg
ulated to avoid any serious consequen
ces.
Trying to get the men out of the
trenches was worse than trying to get
an automobile (or a famous substitute)
out of the mud.
Probably some men's clothes deserve
as severe criticism as that of the
women, but the women, being more
charitable, say nothing.'
An Oregon editor contends that $50
a month isn't enough for a police offi
cer. Of course not, that's only a little
more than an editor gets.
An exchange remarks: "Dried
prunes are going to the soldiers in the
trenches in Europe." That's a method
of offense and defense that hadn't oc
curred to us before.
The north pole controversy stirred
up such a stink that it's funny that no
one has thought before that the inci
dent may throw some light on the ques
tion of where polecats come from.
An expert penman has written 8,000
words on a postal card, so we may ex
pect the mail service to be crippled un
til the card passes through its last hands
into those of the person it Is addressed
to.

Hints Worth Trying
To use the embroidered front of an
old waist You can make a pretty fan
cy apron in a few minutes from the
embroidered front of an old shirtwaist.
First, cut out close to the armholes and
scam, and hand; then double in exact
center from top to bottom, curve out
the top, round the bottom, and edge
with lace, use ribbon for your band and
strings.
To remove the squeak from shoes
Place a amall amount of water in a pan
and put the soles of the shoes in water
for twenty minutes. Remove them and
you will find not only the squeak gone
but the shoes soft and pliable.
To renew shoe lacings When the
metal tip comes off your shoelace, wind
the end firmly and closely with black
thread and sew. You will have a tip as
good as tho one that came off.

SUPPRESSING FACTS
REGARDING MEXICO
Washington, Mar. 1. (Special Cor
respondence) After many weeks of
delay Mr. Wilson deigned to make
answer to the Senate's demand for in
formation regarding affairs in Mexico.
When Senator Fall first formulated his
requests for the facts, early in the ses
sion, there was a disposition among
Democrats to smother the resolution in
committee; but as this method seemed
too transparent and too dangerous, the
administration forces made a fine show
of bravery, asserted that there was
nothing to be concealed in the Mexican
business, and the resolution was passed
without opposition.
At length the reply came in the
form of a letter from Secretary Lansing
who, writing at the President's orders,
declares that it is "incompatible with
the public interest" to make known
much of the material which the Senate
asked for. Among these hidden facts
are the orders under which our forces
entered upon the ill-starred expedition
to Vera Cruz and the correspondence
sent to the State Department by the
Brazilian Minister in Mexico while he
was in charge of our. interests there.
But the outstanding fact which Mr.
Wilson could not deny to the Senate
and to the country is contained in Mr.
Lansing's admission that 93 Americans
have been murdered in Mexico since
"watchful waiting" began its deadly
work and that 36 others among them
16 American soldiers have been killed
on American soil by bands of Mexican
invaders.
In the face of these gruesome details
Mr. Wilson has the hardihood to tell
the Senate that there is in Mexico
"reasonably adequate protection to the
lives and property of Americans" and
that Carranza is maintaining as good a
government down there as anyone
ought to expect.
Fortunately the files of the State De
partment are not the only place in
which to find authentic information re
garding conditions in Mexico. Senator
Fall, who introduced the resolution of
inquiry and who was careful to draft
his demands to cover the essential
points in such an inquiry, already has
authenticated information covering
much of the ground which Mr. Wilson
seeks to surround with secrecy. This
information will be given to the coun
try by means of debate in the Senate;
and Mr. Wilson will find that he cannot
hoodwink the country as to the fruits
of his disastrous Mexican policy.
And Along Came Ruth
"See my new gingham dress!" said
Cousin Maude, one day when Ruth was
visiting her:
"How pretty!" exclaimed Ruth.
"Yes, it's pretty now, but there is
one thing about wash dresses that I
don't like," went on Maude," and that
is the fact that they always fade a lit
tle every time they are washed, and
when it comes time to mend them the
new patches always look so different
from the old dress that it spoils every
thing." "Well, why not avoid that?" pro
tested Ruth, "all you have to do is to
keep a generous piece of the goods
like your dress, and have it washed
every time the dress is washed, then it
will all fade alike, so that when you
are ready to do your mending you will
have material just like the dress."
"What a tine ideal" declared Maude,
"I'm going to get two yards more of
this gingham next time I go to the store
and carry out your suggestion."
Wise and Otherwise
After a rough lie has been polished
it is called hypocracy.
The man who is honest merely from
policy is practically dishonest.
You'd think more women would have
indigestion, but the truth is they don't
swallow half the things their hubbies
think they do.
Now that woman's suffrage is be
coming popular we may expect to hear
of women going to . the poles, both
north and south.
Somehow a girl doesn't realize why
it is that when a man takes a girl to her
first ball game he tries to get off in a
cornor away from their acquaintances.

JOHN EMERSON In The
"BACHELOR'S ROMANCE'
In this delightful comedy-drama John
Emerson portrays the role of David
Holmes, the lovable bachelor of the
play, a kindly, mildly eccentric literary
critic, who runs at the sight of a
woman, only to be tripped head over
heels in a violent love-affair with his
young and pretty ward, Sylvia. Giving
Sylvia at the age of ten into the com
petent hands of an elderly aunt in the
country, David does not realize the
child's development in the passing
years, and with the exception of kind
letters, presents and plenty of money
sent regularly. David almost forgets
the girl's existence, and on her twenty
first birthday sends her a large doll, to
her hysterical surprise. Tiring of the
dullness of the country, she determines
to go and see her guardian, and runs
away to the city with a neighbor youth,
Harry Reynolds, who has written a
wonderful story he wishes to submit
in the serial story contest of which
David is judge. When Sylvia con
fronts her absent-minded guardian,
and announces her determination to
stay, he nearly faints, but is compelled
to take her to his fsister, as his aunt
washes her hands of the disobedient
Sylvia. At first embarrassed and un
comfortable, David grows to be much
at home in Sylvia's presence, and at
last even forgets his loved books for
her, while for Sylvia he is the one man
in the world, though he does not guess
it. He even learns to dance for her
sake, and it is at a ball in her honor
that Harry asks him for Sylvia's hand
and David is made to believe that he is
too old for Sylvia, and that she loves
Harry. He sadly tells her to accept
Harry and Sylvia, thinking that David
does not love her, consents to the en
gagement How the tangle is finally
straightened out, and the two who love
and misunderstand are finally mated,"
is developed in a dramatic climax that
is both logical and satisfactory.
A competent cast supports Mr. Emer

BLANCHE SWEET in the
WARRENS of VIRGINA
SYNOPSIS
Agatha Warren, daughter of the
aristocratic Southern General Warren,
has, before the Civil War, fallen in love
with Ned Burton, of New York. With
the beginning of hostilities, Gen, War
ren takes command of many of the
Southern troops and Burton, enlisting
in the Union army, becomes a Lieuten
ant, the lovers being separated by their
different sympathies.
Most of the action of the drama
which is, beyond question the most
superb battle spectacle ever produced
takes place during the closing days
of the war, when Gen. Warren's sol
diers are suffering from the lack of
supplies. Burton is forced by his
superior officers to use his intimacy
with the Warren family in carrying a
ruse which leads ta the defeat of the
supply trains coming to the relief of
the Confederate army. When he is
captured, Agatha, still loving him in
spite of herself, offers him the means
of escape which he is too proud to ac"
cept. The timely surrender of Lee at
Appomatox is all that saves him from
being shot.
The sequel to these stirring events is
the ultimate reunion of the lovers.
"The Warrens of Virginia" ran for
more than a year at the Belasco Thea
tre in New York City and is acknow
ledged to be the one great classic of the
American Civil War, showing the true
motives of both sides and the sorrows
of fratricidal warfare.
Girls worship novel heroes, but in
real life they prefer men who can pro
vide them with three square meals a
day.
Fame, from a literary point of view,
consists in having people know you
have written a lot of stuff they haven't
read.
Some good people seem to think the
Almighty is making a great mistake in
not leaving the management entirely to
them.
