May Be Pica of Accused Who Alleges
that Fellow Countryman Pursued
Him with Dangerous Knife
After Quarrel
Claiming that he acted in self de
fense, Emelous Gerraro, a Mexican,
shot three times and instantly killed
Juan Lucio, a fellow countryman near
Norge at 3 o'clock yesterday (Friday)
afternoon. Amadcrro Tcrello and Ga
menta Gallina ,also Mexicans, witness
ed the killing.
After the killing the defendant noti
fied the sheriffs office and Sheriif
Bailey assigned Deputy Bob Castleman
to go out and bring the defendant to
C'hickasha.
Deputy Castleman, when he arrived
at the home of one of the Mexicans of
the neighborhood, Frank Calinda.
found his prisoner waiting for him
and ready to surrender. The dead man
Has still lying in a field where he
had been killed. Deputy Castleman
picked up the dead Mexican and
brought the body and the prisoner to
Chickasha. The body was turned, over
to the Sehow Undertaking company
and the man who did the killing was
confined In tho county Jail.
The prisoner alle jn that Lucio cams
to the field where ho was plowing and
began quareling w ith him and that he
later attacked him with a dirk or
knife; that he ran; that tho man he
killed gave chace; that Lucio called
to him to stop; tiiat he replied he had
not time to stop; that he drew the
revolver a .41 caliber Colts, and fired
five shots; that he thought he never
would hit his persuer; that he shot
him three times; that Lucio was chas
ing him while he shot at him.
At the undertaker's it was establish
ed that three bullets had struck the
dead man In the lower portion of his
back; one in the adbomen, ranging up
ward and indicating, the county attor
ney stated, that it had been fired into
the man's body after he had fallen;
one entering the right slue of the face
just below the cheek bone and lodging
:n the .back of the head. In the dead
man's fingers, when picked up, was
clasped the stump of a cigarette.
Officers of the sheriffs office give
Cerraro a good name. Papers found
on the person of Lucio Indicate that he
was of a nomadic turn. Tha knife,
which the defendant alleges the man
he killed drew on him. Is a murder
our affair with a blade about seven
inches long. On the dead man, be
neath his shirt, was found a scabbard
into which the knife fits. It is under
stood that Garraro will plead both self
defense and the unwritten Jaw.

TROUBLE IN SCHOOL
DISTRICT IS SETTLED
Out in school district No. 54 a tur
moil arose a few day3 ago when one of
the patrons of the school attempted
to settle a little school trouble with
a member of the! board of directors.
The member of the board and the pa
tron of the school engaged in an ex
change of hard language and harder
blows. The trouble arose over, some
broken windows, broken by some on 8
unknown to anyone, but supposed to
have been broken by ono or mors boy
pupils of the school.
Superintendent Shepard, learning of
the trouble, saddled his trusty Ford
and went out to tho scene of the 'trou
ble yesterday and so far succeeded in
pouring oil on the troubled waters that
all hands around shook hands and bur
ied the hatchet and didn't mark the
fyave. Tho story reads: windows;
boys; stone thrown, crash smash;
tales told; quarrel; fight; matter
straightened: hands shaken.
Aiitiuipating that Germany's next great drive will be into Egypt, with the capture or the Suez canal as the ob
jective, Great Britain is concentrating men, ammunition, food and supplies to block such-a possibility. This photograph

ALL CAUSED
BY TANK OF
GASOLINE
Small Tempest in City Official Circles
Starts When Sunshine Puts in Oil
Supply Equipment; Obstruction
Question is Raised
A small-sized tempest has Ijeen kick
ed up in municipal government circles
through the installation of an under-
round gasoline tank, with self-meas
uring pumping attachment, in front of
the Sunshine grocery, 2H Chickasha
bvenue.
Information shows that some time
ince two or more Chickasha avenue
dealers signified their intentions or
installing similar gasoline supply equip
ments in front of their places of bus
iness. At that time the matter was
taken up by the city council and
threshed out and oral Instructions
ere given Fire Chief Gattis. These
instructions were adverse to the gaso
line tanks.
Chief Gattis advised those who de-
ired to put in the tanks of the action
of the council and nothing further was
eard until the matter of the installa
tion of the Sunshine tank'came up.
Mayor Coffman stated that the man
ager of( tho Sunshine grocery had in
stalled the gasoline tank and that the
pumping attachment to the tank ex
tended above the sidewalk, said ex
tension being contrary to the provis
ions of ordinance No. 514.
Mayor Coffman further stated that
then? was no ordinance forbidding the
lacing of underground gasoline tanks
on any street or avenue in Chickasha,
tyt he again referred to ordinance
No. i,14 and called attention to a few
of its provisions. The mayor stated
that this ordinance provides against
ny obstruction being placed upon any
dewalk unless the said obstructions
are confined to a space not to exceed
i two feet along the inner side of the
sidewalk, or abutting the "property or
building line.
When asked what steps he would
take in the matter the mayor said that
he would do nothing until the council
met. The matter would probably be
taken up by the council, Mr. Coffman
mid, and he- would follow out and
carry through any instructions of the
council.
Mayor Coffman stated further that
the Sunshine was not "lonesome" in
the matter of violating the ordinances
against sidewalk obstructions and he
further stated that should the council
demand the removal of these obstruc
tions he would see to it that all ob
structions would bo removed; that ho
would "hew to tho line, let the chips
fall where they may;" that he would
act in conjunction with Uhe chief of
police and have the ordinance literal
ly enforcing by moving every standing
sign, every crate, every coop of
chickens, every barrel of apples, every
More display placed on the sidewalks
of Chickasha at any point in the
city.
"If the council cares to have the or
dinance literally enforced, I will see
that it is so enforced, concluded the
mayor.
Further investigation developed that
at the time tho fire chief was instruct
ed regarding the lnstnllntion of gaso
line supply stations, the council did
io orany ana tnat inere is no oruin-
railway station in Alexandria,
ance in effect governing the matter.
An idea seemed prevalent that there
was a resolution to this effeet but it
developed that the records of the city
clerk, do not show such a resolution
as having been adopted at any time.
The territory covered by tha ordin
ance is composed of both sides of
Chickasha avenue from First "street to
Sixth street. No alley or other street
Eeeins to be "segregated" in the mat
ter in controversy.
PHONY COIN
REPORTED
PLENTIFUL
The concensus of opinion among
business men seems to be that some
bunch is either trying to make Chick
asha a dumping ground for counter
feit silver dollars and quarters, or has
already made it such. At any event,
to use the language of one Chickasha
business man, the city seems "lousey
with them "
The first dollars of bad repute de
tected floating about were of the sup
posed mintage of 1001. Just ahout the
time the citizenship of the community
began to bite and test all "pieces of
one" of the above year's mhitage, up
bobbed a harfdfull of frauds with the
year 18S1 stamped under tho smiling
features of the lady of liberty.
These 1SS1 and 1901 dollars were
good counterfeits and could be passed
by the "shovers of the queer" but were
not so nearly perfect as to be con
sidered dangerous and could be detect
ed reaeuiy enougn uy ouo hu-j nao
careful in taking in money and in mak
ing change. But the last dollar, which
came to bat along Chickasha avenue
yesterday afternoon the dollar of
3902, is one of the most dangerous
of its species. This ttoliar, line as
brothers of 1SS1 and 1901. is "a mould
ed affair, tout, where the mouiuea
"milling" of the last named is imper
fect, the "milling" of tho 1902 article
seems to have been retouched and
made to appear lika genuine. Th
size is o. k., the ring is perfect and
the weight is only a trifle off. The
base metal in the dollar has been care
fully "whitewashed" and the "greasy
feel" almost entirely eliminated.
In addition to the dollars in circula
tion, quarter dollars, are alleged to
have been floaled. and fruit peddlers
and shine artists are heinging to cast
about them and look at dimes with
insulting scrutiny whenever anyone in
vests in their commodities.
A clerk in a small downtown store is
said to have made the statement yes
terday that a rtranger came to him and
asked for change for a dollar. He said
this stranger had a handfull of "silver
dollars' and that; he asked him for
"change for a dollar.' The clerk said
the dollar which the man threw down
was phoney, but he did uot know
whether the other dollars he had in
his hand were good or bad. When he
told the man that his dollar was
phoney the fellow picked it up' and
walked out of the store without argu
nient.

COLLEGE
STUDENTS
ARE AIDED
Sorosis Study Club Contributes to Main
taining Scholarship, Providing Funds
for Worthy Girls to Pursue
Studies in 0. C. W.
(By IVrs. 3. B. Barefoot, president of
Sorosis.)
At the beginning of the achool year
of 1914, learning of the number of
girls who had applied for work at the
O. C. W. after the places had all been
filled, and knowing that these girls
could not possibly attend school with
out assistance- the Sorosis siuay ciub
decided to help as many of these am
bitious young women as it could.
It accordingly began at onoe to se
curo money for a scholarship fund and
has been at work so diligently ever
since that the words "Sorosis Scholar
ship Fund" are familiar to all.
Last year two young ladies were
given $J00 each. As these girls assist
ed in the dormitory to pay their board
this money was used to purchase
books, stationery and incidentals, pay
labratory fees and provide the few
clothes absolutely necessary. Another
young woman, an orphan entirely,
thro n upon her own resources, wiioru
Sorosis saw fit to give some help
after Christinas,-was finishing in do
mestic science and domestic art and
just a few days ago was given a posi
tion in a western state at a salary of
$100 per month.
Through the influence of and enthus
iasm aroused by the Chickasha club
the club women of Hobart decided to
support a scholarship in O. C. W. this
year. This scholarship was given a
young woman from their city whon.
the Chickasha club hd iiooiotcd last
year. The young lady who was for
tunate enough to secure a scholarship
last year did such good work that a
member of Sorosis saw fit to give her
an individual scholarship this year.
There are at present three young
women atter.ding O. C. W. who but for
the help given them would not find it
possible to be in school.
In addition to this, Sorosis has loan
ed $100 to a very worthy young woman
who is preparing to teach. It ia hef
plan to teach next year and repay the
?100, then come the following year and
borrow from the loan fund again.
Also in addition to the above, Sorosis
both as a club and as individuals, con
tributes liberally to the Fifth district
scholarship fund which for several
years past has support od one scholar
ship each year and this year supports
t'6.
Surely the interest In scholarship
work and loan funds is increasing.
There are at present ten girls attend
ing O. C. W. who have either scholar
thips or loans.
These girls are required to toriLg uo
a high average grade and their report
cards, together with an itemized ac
count of their expenses is sent at th
end of each semester to the club com
mittee, ' MARRIAGE LICENSES ISSUED.

AESTHETIC DANCING
IS POPULAR FEATURE
Girls in Pretty Costumes Give Artistic and
Graceful Numbers; Music and Min
strels Make Hits; MissShaley
Director
The vaudeville and "stunt show,"
given by the O. C. W. Athletic asso
ciation at the college last night was the
best drawing card of the year and the
girls entertained a full house.. The
evening's entertainment was a suc
cess from start to finish and the au
dience showed their pleasure by heart'
ily encoring every number.
Tho curtain was raised! upon the
Apple Blossom dance,, a beautiful and
finished piece of aesthetic dancing.
Twenty-five young girls, dressed in
pink and green with apple blossoms
n their hair,, danced in a woodland
bower of blossoms, delighting all with
their grace of movement.
Equally well received was "Spring
Time in Hellen," in which charmin?
Grecian dances were executed by
young girl3 in Grecian costumes. A
Scottish dance, featuring Miss Irmgani
Kloers, a fantastic balloon dance and
an exhibition of modem Russian danc
ing were all artistic numbers. None
was prettier, however, than the Ameri
can Beauty dance, in which the girls
were dressed in red and green, to rep
resent their chosen flower. vir
ile Wallace, adorned as a fairy, took
a graceful solo part in this number.
Undoubetdly the hit of the evening
was the novelty ministrel quartet. In
cluding Misses Hazel Owsley, RebectA
Armstrong, Phanette Frankenfield and
Clara Pierce. The girls, wore Palm
Beach suits and Panama hats and1 with
cc.nplexions darkened, put on a minia
ture minstrel show, inclindlng late
songs and clog dancing1!
Another clever feature was "Tha
Love Life of a Man," in which Miss
Bernice Hawley, as a man dreaming
in his study, had visions of his many
sweethearts. The girls appearing In
these visions were Misses Vernie Wil
liams, Dorothy Gorman, Bess Flower,
.Maxine Cox, Katherine Kerr and Haztl
Owsley. The songs in this number
were Miss Ethel Carson's composi
tions. In a laughable burlesque on "Mid
summer Nights' Dream," Miss Atta
Grigsley took a leading part, for which
she reserves much credit, having been
called upon to learn it only 24 hours
before.
A jumping 3iid vaulting number was
of great interest and displayed a phase
of practical gymnasium work. The en
tertainment was under the direction of
Miss Shaley, the physical culture di
rector of the O. C. W. and the success
of the evening is largely due to her
untiring efforts.
