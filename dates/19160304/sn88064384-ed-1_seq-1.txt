3400 r. p. m. Subdued, Controlled and Converted Into Thrifty Energy
• • There is more meaning wrapped up in the term
' 3400„r. p. m. Chalmers" than in any phrase in the
history of motor building.
It means, first of all, performance
It means might fused with mileage, and brute force
tamed into silken flexibility.
t It means supreme engine speed attained with abso
lute safety, and big horse-power that you and I dare
drive.
It means that every drop of gasoline that is inhaled
into the aluminum lungs of this wonderful beast's
engine is compelled to deliver every available gram of
its dynamic energy.
It means the subordination of superfluous might
mtothe golden boon of imperishable pick-up, obedience,
and a smooth-running, uninterrupted, throbless stream
of might.
. If means 18 miles of glorious going from every gal
lon of gas, and a saving of $150 to $200 per year in
gasoline that an engine of useless might would require.
It means 60 miles an hour, if you want speed, with
out whisper of the roar of racing motors.
It means performance plus, and cost of upkeep
minus.
It means incomparable ability "on high" beyond
any car in its price-class—anything from two miles an
hour to twenty-five in less than ten seconds.
It means everything that the name Chalmers stands
for at a lower price than any other Chalmers car has
ever borne.
It means a competition-cleaving car, built under
new conditions of quantity production under the Chal
mers' roof, at a time when the whole South is able to
buy cars on a scale never equalled before.
It means that I am prepared to make prompt de
liveries in the order of sales.
It means that this is the car you'll feel you must
own, once you ha ve seen and felt it perform.
No man is sage enough to foretell the condition of
the market for materials a few weeks hence. It will be
the part of wisdom and may save many a regret
if you record your order now.
