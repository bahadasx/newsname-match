BETTY AND SAM.
Tiy BENJ. V. LONGDON, Chilllcothe,
.Mo.
When little Jack Horner was about
5 years old, his father and mother
built a very nice house, .much nicer
than their old one. They informed
their architect that they wanted a love
ly corner big enough for Jack. By
building a kind of a round bay win
dow at the corner of the living room
he made a big round, sunshiny corner.
Jack Horner was somewhat old fash
ioned, and It was amusing to see him
cuddled down in a little corner and
smiling at everybody who looked at
him.
We are reminded of this simple story
whenever we look at Betty and Sam's
corner.
Of course you know that Jack Hor
ner and our Betty and Sam are of dif
ferent parentage, family and race, and
remember that nature has been im
proving the Ipdividual since the story
of Jack Homer was written, and is
flot yet so satisfied with her work
that she exhibits exact reproductions.
Betty and Sara's god-father reserves
a lovely corner for them In every is
sue of the, Sun, and they have formed
the habit of cuddling down in their
corner and .smiling as they tell us
what "they say." The surprise that
Betty and Sam have for those who do
not know them Is their Btmple sincer
ity which Is a very child-like qual
ity, They give us the essence of what
they hear of the city, the school, theMl&dnmes Chapman, Page,
church and the state as well as of
small family and Individual affairs.
They have succeeded in touching
deep points, dwelling most on season
able ones, differing without dicord,
sometimes grave, yet always happy
and agreeable. And In conclusion we
confess that if anyone should ask us
why wo admire Betty and Sam, we
feel it could no otherwise be expressed
than by making answer: "Because
they are companionable to unusual de
gree and speak out regardless of what
people say.
In these words there lies the tyran
ny of the world, the" wholo destruction
of our natural disposition, and the
oblique vision of our minds."
And this is what:
' "
"We told the thrush, an dwe laughed
together, ,
Laughed till the woods were all
aring.
And he said to us, as he plumed each
feather,
'Well, people must say, if they can
. not sing,
Long live Betty and Sam.' "

been up in arms for the past few days,
and the excitement ended in a mass
meeting last Thursday night to pro
test against the production of the
Birth of a Nation, which is billed to
show at the auditorium earlv in March
A committee was appointed headed
to act, even to the employing of an at
torney in court proceedings if it
should be necessary. The committee
has prepared the following petition
which will be presented to the city
council:
To His Honor the Mayor, and the City
Council of Helena
Gentlemen:
The understtgned citizens of Helena,
learning to their amazement and re
gret that the photoplay "Birth of a
Nation," a play destined to create an
tagonism and race feelings, Is to be
presented in this city March 8 to 11,
inclusive, at the city Auditorium, do
hereby petition your honorable body
not to grant a llcenso for the presen
tation of said photoplay and forbid its
production in this city, fol the follow
ing reasons:
It is Immoral, It breaks faith with
a part of your citizens, and awakens
a feeling of fear and hatred toward
them. It Is against public policy, nnfl
a discrimination against a single sec
tion of society, and violates the social
compact on which the relation of all
true citizenship is founded.
Who of you gentlemen in this coun
cil chamber this morning could look
upon that scene of the Negro Gus, as
written in the 'play by RevT Thos.
Dixon, attacking a young and Innocent
girl of your race, whether It be true
or false, without having the manhood
within you stirred to its depths with
feeling of hatred and murder against
tho race of which Gus is made the
representative,
After viewing that scene, and the
subsequent one or this innocent now.
er of girlhood jumping from the cliff
to her death rather than face the dis
grace, you would look at us, and your
boys would look Into the faces of our
boys with feelings of mingled hostility
and rage; of hatred and distrust. The
scene of the Heut. Governor Lynch,
making love to Elsie Stoneman leaves
a stench in the nostrils of any cham
pinn.otjoutrage.djvomanho.od, and lab
els an entire race with the elements
of the brutel
It is unfair to the Negroes of Hel
ena, because of the place in which it
Is to be staged (City Auditorium).
We in proportion to our financial
ability, pay taxes and thereby assist
in building and maintaining the city
conveniences, and we do not deem it
consistent with our standing as men,
to idly sit, and without an effort to tho
reverse, allow a show to be shown that
is intended to rob us of the enjoyment
that our hard and small earnings have
provided for us.
Your Honor, and Gentlemen of the
Council, we have in part, submitted
our protest. The issue Is with you.
Men of wisdom, of justice and the love
of fair play that you are, we withdraw
from your honorable presence with the
feeling that our cause Is In safe hands,
not for mercy, however, but for jus
tice. We feel that your actions will be in
accordance with the principles of the
immortal Lincoln, "With malice to
ward none, with charity for all; with
firmness in the right as God gives you
to see the right."
