The Democracy
""P HE present admin-
'4 istration finished
three years of its of
ficial life yesterday. It
is difficult to review its
work and the effect of
that work, because the
'J mighty war in the old
-j,i world has prevented
r, results of the measures
. i which it has driven
'i ' through from being
made clear. "When the
war came on the effects
'f of its tariff annihilation
were becoming most
f apparent. The -sudden
j- demand for war ma-
y terial is all that has
I saved the party in
power. Any policy'
i which cannot b e car-
. ried out without a I
wholesale destruction
t " of scores of industries
f to which the working
hosts of the country
f look for employment, is
II bound to fail so soon as
tried, unless, as in the
present case, a new
field can be found for
these workers.
It is reasonably clear
that Mr. Wilson's re
election next Novem
ber depends upon the
continuance of the for
eign war until that
time. He is receiving
much unjust credit just
now because the for
eign demand for food
j,r and war munitions, due
entirely to the war,
makes many districts
of our country most
prosperous. Were that
demand to suddenly
cease, the prostration
that would at once
come would be unjustly
charged to him.
The present clamor
for a more effective
preparedness for our
I country against pos-
I sible attack, for im-
I mense appropriations
I of money to carry on
I the work and for vast
I appropriations for the
R improvement of rivers
and harbors, are all but
H expedients for making
Successful Men of Utah

GHARLES W. WHITLEY, who arrived in Salt Lake thirteen years ago to assume the man
agement of the American Smelting & Refining company and its allied interests, has al
ways been successful, but his greatest triumphs have come within the past ten years,
coincident with the remarkable expansion of the great mining interests in this and sur
rounding states, though the various enterprises with which he is prominently identified are by no
means confined to his chosen field of endeavor.
Mr. Whitley was born in Chicago on June 20, 1870, the son of John and Elizabeth Holbrook Whit
ley. He spent his boyhood there and later graduated from the Institute of Technology in Boston.
Returning to Chicago in 1891 he shortly afterwards was appointed electrical engineer of the Chicago
City Railway Company and planned and supervised the installation of its first electrical machinery.
For some time ho had heard the call of the West, and his next big work was the construction of
the Canyon Ferry dam on the Missouri river near Helena. He became interested in the mining and
smelting business and after a short time in that fiel'd became the manager of the plants of the
United Smelting & Refining Company at East Helena, and Great Falls, Mont. He arrived in Salt
Lake City in the latter par .f 1902, having been made General Manager of the American Smelting
& Refining Company here, as noted above.

i howling political cam- H
paign. We say this be- H
cause our country is in H
less danger from attack H
than it was every min- H
utc for fifteen years H
prior to the commence- H
mcnt of the present H
great foreign war, for jH
the strength of all H
strong foreign powers H
except Japan will be H
exhausted, and Japan, H
if she had the desire H
would hesitate before H
she would attempt to H
assault a nation like H
ours five thousand H
miles away from her H
nearest base. H
A steady prepared- H
ness on our part should H
go on, but the present H
excitement, the sudden H
advertising to the H
world that our republic, H
with its hundred mil- H
lions of people and il- H
limitable resources H
would be helpless if at- H
tacked and that an at H
tack is liable to come H
at any moment, is dis- H
graceful and can be ac- H
counted for on no H
grounds save as a parti- H
san expedient to bolster H
a frightened party H
through a pending H
doubtful campaign. H
Then how does the H
president's present bold H
front, and his learned H
dissertations on the in- H
violability of the honor H
of the republic compare H
with the messages sent H
our citizens in Mexico H
to get out, which was H
equivalent to saying: H
"No matter if you are H
in Mexico by the spe- JM
cial invitation of the H
president of that coun- H
try, who in the invita- H
tion promised you full H
protection for your H
lives and property, and H
though your all is in- H
vested there, you had H
better come out, be- H
cause we cannot pro- H
tect you." H
We have tremendous H
exports and imports. H
The war has been rag- M
ing since August 21, H
1915 more than eigh- H
teen months; what has M
