BLAME THE
"REFORMERS"
The Fad Leaders and Sob Sisters
Constantly Suggesting New
Methods of Robbing
Taxpayers.
Tho law ought to bo amended so
that professional reformers could be
jailed without trial every time they
discovered a new fad.
Professional reformers are behind
the robbery ot the taxpayers of Chi
cago. Taxes were never so high ns they
are now and are still going up.
Reformors are still flocking to Chi
cago to pluck tho industrious people
and to fill high salaried but unneces
sary jobs created for them.
Public Welfare!
Public morals!!
Civil service!!!
What extortion and robbery of tax
payers Is commltted'ln those names.
Jobs for women reformers.
.lobs for malo reformers.
Jobs for professional reformers.
And the Chicago taxpayer pays the
freight.
The City Council is full of useless
men. It is a useless body, It does no
good and is responsible for the creat
ing ot costly Jobs to gratify fads.
It is time the people woke up and
called a halt on this saturnalia ot ex
travagance. Ten million dollars a year could bo
saved to tho city by tho abolition of
usoless Jobs.

Is part' of tho net result of the work
of "reforms" In tho City Council for
the past flvo years. The other net re

is the Increase of tho number of em
ployes and the increase ot the money
coming from the people and spent on
salaries for city employes, from
twenty-four millions to over thirty-live
millions.

LUNDIN AND HARRISON
Brundage Shows How They
Were to Split the Judicial
Ticket Between Them.
Edward J. Brundago in Chicago
Evening Post: "So far as the nam
ing of tho judicial ticket oloctod last
June Is concerned, I think Lundln's
plan, which tho mayor finally adoptod
after he had directed a Republican
tlckot in a conference with Charles
Darrott, Homer ' Galpln and Charles
A. Williams, at Peoria, would have
been suicidal to tho Republican party.
Tho cold proposition advanced by
Fred Lundin was to divide the ticket
with tho Carter Harrison Democrats.)
When mention was made of the six
new judges, Lundlln suggested they
be divided equally, I told Lundlln
then that the placing ot these men
upon' the bench by agreemont of three
or four political leaders was contrary
of
to tho nrlnclnlcs of IlcDubllcanlsm.
and it It were dono a revolt would '
follow, the Progressives would call a
convention and namo a ticket and
the bar would support their ticket.
Lundin said ho did not caro anything
about tho Progressives. It was a
very slmplo matter to dlsposo ot in
his own words: "Let Dcnecn tako
Well
one, you (meaning me) take one, and
Thompson the other, and then give
the Carter Harrison follows three."
Chicago needs a new City Hall. The
new one will probably be built la
Union Park on the West 814.
