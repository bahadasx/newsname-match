attack failed.
"On both sides of the Meuse the
French increased the activity of their
artillery and after a great increase in

tho German drive for Verdun there
has come a second halt. Paris today

Confidence in the outcome of the
Verdun struggle has been expressed
by General Gallieni, the French min
ister of war, according to a Paris dis
patch. The Russian occupation of Bltlis,
in Turkish Armenia, is. declared by
Petrograd correspondents to separate
the Turkish force operating in the
vicinity of MuBh from that in the
Lake Urumiah district,
Tbe German admiralty announces
the sinking by German submarines of
two French auxiliary cruisers and a
British patrol boat. It Is unofficially
declared in Paris that the Gorman
claim to the sinking of two auxiliary
cruisers "off Havre" is unfounded.
The driving German assault on
Verdun has halted for the second time
in the Douaumont sector northeast of
Verdun, on this occasion in the face
of a formidable counter attack by
the French in an effort to retake Dou
aumont village.
The clash of the opposing armies at
this point was extremely desporate

Washington, March 4. News of
William J. Bryan's arrival caused a
flurry on the house floor.
Representative Bailey, Democrat,
his close friend, mot him and Bailey
said thoy discussed the warning reso
lution situation.
Whllo Mr. Bailey insisted that Mr.
Bryan would take no active part in
tho fight, administration leaders saw
In his presence cause for concern.
Their interest was further aroused
jwhen it was learned that Mr Bryan
expects to return horo tomorrow and
remain until Monday night when he
speaks, in Wilmington, Delaware
Majority Leader Kitchin and others
who are generally classed as Bryan
Democrats, Insisted they had not
heard from Mr Bryan and had not
known he was in town.
Cannot Defeat Wilson Policy.
Administration leaders expressed
confidence that no influence that Mr.
Bryan might bring to bear would de
feat the president's determination.
Mr. Bailey said ho assured Mr Bry
an that at heart there aws an over
whelming majority in congress favor
able to the warning resolution, but
that he made no predictions as to
what tho vote would bo.
"Mr Bryan is interested just as is
any othor citizen in the McLemore
resolution," ho said, "but he certainly
will not come to tho capitol and mako
a personal fight on It. His attitude
toward tho senato action yesterday
was one of amusement. Ho referred
to it laughingly. Ho certainly did not
consider It a victory for those who
are opposing warning passengers
against boarding armed ships."
Chairman Flood eaid.
"Ho can't beat the tabling of this
resolution, if he tries."
To Address Club.
Mr. Bryan is to address the Econo

States take toward insuring a perman

of speakers representing every view

Mr, Bryan Bald his coming horo at

GET AWAY WITH VALUABLE!!
Go Through the Pockets of the Sleeping Men. and Rob the 1B
Jewelry Cases of the Women Traveling Passenger i:
Agent Loses $120 in Currency and a Gold Watch. ' "r.
;i
One of the most skillful robberies
that has occurred in Ogden in many
months was perpetrated last night at
the residence of J. C. Nye, 2546 Adams
avenue, according to a report made to
the police this morning. Not only the
rooms occupied by tho Nye family,
but those of Mr. and Mrs. F. D, Wilson
and Miss Lucia McDonald, were visit
ed by the thieves. (
The robbery Is believed to have oc
curred between 1 and 5 a. m. while
the occupants of the house were
asleep, but the people being at home
did not deter the thieves from enter
ing several of tho sleeping rooms and
ransacking bureau drawers and cloth
ing for money and jewelry.
From Mr. Nye's trousers, according
to the report, they secured $3.45, and
a diamond shirt stud belonging to the
head of the house was also taken.
Mr. Wilson, who Is a traveling pas
senger agent of the Union Pacific,
was the heaviest loser, tho robbers
securing $120 in currency, a gold
watch and a pocket case containing a
number of annual railroad passes and
other valuable papers. The watch
was of great value to Mr Wilson, hav
ing been presented to him by a group
of his employes a number of years ago
while he was a general agent for an
other company. It was engraved with
the letter "W" and the names of the
donors. At the time the robbery oc
curred, Mr. Wilson was occupying the
sleeping porch.
Miss McDonald lost a gold ring with
a Greek letter setting, three valuable
pins, a set of earrings and a pair o
gold clasps. These were in a purple
velvet case, which was also carried
away.
It is thought that the crime was
committed by two men, this clue being
given by footprints In the yard lead
ing to tho library window, through
which the nocturnal visitors gained
an entrance to the house.

of the accident It is sixty feet high
at tho point whero the train went
off. Tho engine and a mixed mail
and express car passed over safely
but tho three coaches behind plunged
through the weakened structure.
It is said that tho fire on the bridge
probably was started by the passen

WILSON VICTORY
PLEASES BRITISH
London, March 4, 12:10 p. m. Fow
things short of an actual military vic
tory could have given the BrltlBh press
greater satisfaction than President
Wilson's victory In the senate.
The Manchester Guardian remarks
editorially that Germany, having fail
ed to convince the United States, ap
parently will Ignore sontlmont in that
country.
It continues:
Germany to Assume Defiant Role.
"Germany has now doflantly assum
ed tho line that she is within her
rights and means to abide by the con
sequences. If American citizens lose
tholr lives sho will inako no apology
or promise of amendment"
Tho Guardian says it cannot imag-j
Ine that Americans will accept "such
a reversion to absolute barbarism and
therefore regards the decision of the
senate as having tho greatest significance."

after a long preliminary bombard- 'H

The French artillery fire was so
fierce that evening that the Germans
were unable to push the attack on
any point of the Douaumont plateau. 'H
Thoy profited by the night, however, il
to bring up masses of reserves and 'VH
the fighting began with renewed fury CMH
on Thursday. '
During the morning and the after- "".

Third Attack Opens.
The third attack began about 3 ;
o'clock in the afternoon. It was qvcii o
more violent than those which have JaH
preceded. For more than an hour the mM
Germans came on in serried ranks,
hurling themselves, regardless ot H
cost, against the ridges held by tho ' f
Frenchmen. At last the defenders' j jl

momentarily, and the counter attack, '' (IH

the Germans back to tho shelter of if-
