London, .March I (1:10 a. in.) -The
status of non-union workers who at
the request of the government have
been allowed ,$ W(,rk alongside the
union men In sonic of the more Im
portant war trades, seems likely to
come into prominence again. An im
portant statement on this point Just
issued by officials of the Transport
Workers' union, says:
"Tlie question of non-union men
threatens to become a serious matter.
Contrary to our expectations, new
comers into the ranks of the trans
port workers have not joined the
union, but on the other hand have In
fluenced old members to become dil
atory. The Transport Workers' fed

!a reasonable time will be given for
all of those concerned to Join In their

no fooling about the matter,
"We have no wish to do anything
to Interfere with the successful pros
ecution of the war, but we must close
our ranks and make the transport or
ganizations proof aKainst black legs.
To bo outside of the union is to bo
disloyal not only to your own class
but to yourself individually."

As the ministry of marine on Feb
ruary 29 announced that the number
of survivors of the IYovence disaster
waH estimated at 870, it is indicated
by the foregoing dispatch that up
wards of 3.130 lives were lost.
It was stated that on board the
Provence were the staff of the Third
colonial infantry regiment, the Third
battalion, the Second company of the
First battalion, the Second machine
Ran company and one extra company,
in all nearly 4,000 men.

The official statement announcing
the sinking of the Provence said:
"The French auxiliary cruiser Pro
veiice n (so designated to distinguish
her from th French battleship Pro
vence), engaged in transporting
troops to Haloniki, was sunk in the
Mediterranean on February 20. Two
hundred and ninety-six survivors
have been brought to Malta and
about 400 to Melon by French and
Hrltlsh patrol vessels summoned by
wireless.
"No signs of a submarine were no
ticed either before or after the sink
ing. Ijtt Provence was armed with
five cannon of 14 centimetres, two of
57 millimetres and for of 47 milli
metres." Greatest Marine Disaster.
The loss of more than 3,000 lives
in the sinking of the French auxiliary
cruiser Provence is the greatest ocean
disaster of modern times. Up to the
present, tho largest number of lives
ever lost in one wreck was when the
White Star llnr Titanic struck an
iceberg off the New Foundland banks
on April H, 1J12, and sank with a
death loss of 1.&96. Tho rescued
numbered 74 3.
The French ministry of marine had
previously issuea no siaieineni us m
the number of persons on the Pro
vence, when she went down. Tho ves
sel, however, when in the trans-Atlantic
service, could carry 1,960 per
sons, Including the crew, and it has
been presumed that, as she was trans
porting troops between ports not far
apart, sho was carrying a number of
men larger than her normal capacity.
Other Sea Disasters.
Among the other great sea disas
ters, in addition to the Titanic already
mentioned, were:
. The Cunard line steamship Lusi

of Kinsale, Ireland, on May 7, 1915.
