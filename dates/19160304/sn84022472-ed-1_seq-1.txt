relieve traffic on East Broadway and !
would cut off a mile for automobilists j
and other vehicles m reaching Devon.
f"dse Howard J. Curtis discouraged J
the proposition, saying that it would
take an additional two mill tax to do
it besides the $10,000 already appropri

the occasion did not warrant it. Sec

LIQUOR CLUBS TO
SELL TOMORROW
AT THEIR PERIL
Officials Move To Stamp Out
"Booze Camps" Through
out City.
STANLEY IS ITCHING
TO LEAD MORE RAIDS
Young Emmet Case Post
poned Pending Decision
on Remonstrance.
Down goes the lid on the Sunday
booze camps!
There'll be no more t dispensing of
intoxicants in many so-called club
rooms, of the city, until the county
commissioners make a ruling as to
whether the clubs' are bona fide, and
entitled to hold liquor licenses as a
part of the general business of their
clu'b life. Tomorrow Sunday Is the
day the clubs thrive they must be
closed. Otherwise, they'll be. raid
ed. Shortly after the last election, the
administration which had not receiv
ed expected support from (the politi
cal organizations that ihave their
headquarters in these liquor clubs,
announced that the liquor clubs must
go. This announcement, serai -officially
made, was followed y remon
strances filed with the county com
missioners by Albert J. Merritt, liquor
prosecu'ting agent, by the Pastors as
sociation, and others. The legitimate
liquor dealers, though not appearing
in the remonstrances, were keenly
Interested because th.e so-called clubs
had been cutting into their profits, es
pecially in the cases of the "neigh
borhood" saloon.
A raid was ' made last Sunday on
the Young Emmet club. Today the
persons arrested in the Sunday raids
were placed on trial in the city court.
The usual defence that the clubs
were bona fide social organizations in
which the dispensing- of liquor was
merely incidental to the life of the
,club was offered, and the court
made no decision. But it was ap
parent, from the statements of of
ficials connected with the prosecution
of the cases, that there will be raids
tomorrow if these or any other of the
clubs against which remonstrances
"have 'been filedC open their' 'fcars ' for
business.
Until the last legislature enacted a
law calling- for the issuance of a spe
cial form of license for the dubs that
handle liquor, the local custom
maintained under . a ruling- of Carl
Foster, as city court judge was . to
allow clubs -which were regarded as
bona fide organizations with purposes
other than the dispensing of liquors
to sell intoxicants to ; members- only,
without any . state license.
- Bfi the last legislature's radical
changes in liquor legislation included
a provision calling for the licensing

Of the clubs in 'Bridgeport applying
for such) licenses there were a dozen

BRIDGEPORTERS
ARE INDICTED
IN MEAT CASES
.
Federal Grand Jury Acts
Against Packing Houses
And Managers:
Hartford, March 4 For the first
time in the United States the govern
ment is to test the meaning of the
meat inspection laws in the indict
ments prepared by United -States Dis
trict Attorney Thomas J. Spellacy of
this city and returned by the federal
grand Jury in New Haven, against the
Cudahy Packing Co. of Bridgeport,
and its local manager. J. H. Coughlln;
Morris & Co. of Bridgeport, and their
local manager. George T. Roberts, and
the Cudahy Packing Co. of New Ha
ven and .its local manager, Jolin A.
Crowe.
Seventeen counts were found against
each of the two Bridgeport meat
houses for shipping meat from unoffi
cial meat stations without reinspec
tion, and two counts against the New
Havfa house for shipping meat from
an unofficial station without inspec
tion and for not furnishing a certifi
cate of inspection to the common car
rier. The defendants are to appear in
the Federal court at New Haven,
Tuesday.
The meat concerns have official sta
tions for meat inspection in Chicago
and other cities, and they also have
many unofficial houses. The method of
shipment of meat, without reinspec
tion from an unofficial house has rais
ed a question as to the meaning of the
meat inspection law, and it is expect
ed these indictments will clear up the
matter.
Two Fatally Burned
By Naptha in Shops
of British American
Stamford, March 4 Two men were
burned "severely, , possibly fatally, at
the British-American Co.'s. factory in
Springdale, today. The company
makes iaincoat cloth. The men in
jured were Peter Sautalguto of Stam
ford, and Samuel Rocco of Springdale.
The burns were received from naphtha.
The supposition is that static elec
tricity and atmospheric conditions
made a combination which responded
to a spark struck by the steel nails in
the shoes of one of the men and this
spark ignited gas which had risen
from a tank containing the fluid used
in the making of cloth.

Love Pleasant, Judge
1 F. A. Bartlett Finds
Even though a young man falls in
love with a girl at first sight there is
no reason why he should fores himself
upon her when she shows that she has
no desire for his company. . That
was the opinion expressed by Judge
Frederic A. Bartlett in city court this
morning when William Rogers, of 679
William street and Walter Kelly, of
292 Pequonnock street, were arraigned
on a charge of breach of the peace
and assault.
Rogers Is a grinder at the Reming
ton Arms & Ammunition Co. and Kelly
is a conductor for the Connecticut Co.
The latter, courts Margaret Tracy, a
pretty young woman of 18 years, liv
ing at 1316 Main street. Miss Tracy
works in the Canfield Rubber factory
in Housatonic avenue. Rogers ac
costed her Thursday at noon as she
was going back to work. He asked
her if she objected to his accompany
ing her as he liked her. Miss Tracy
allowed him to walk to the factory
with her the first day but told him
that' she did not further desire his
company.
That evening she told Kelly of the
meeting with Rogers. He disapprov
ed of the actions of Rogers and yes
terday he walked to the factory with
Miss Tracy. Rogers was on the scene
as usual and he greeted Miss Tracy
with a "How dydo" and joined the
pair. The result was that Kelly
punched Rogers' jaw and a tussle en
sued which was stopped upon the ar
rival of Policemen James Callan and
George Benedetti.
Judge Bartlett entered a nolle In
his case. Rogers was fined $5 and
costs. He paid.

Meets To Frame Special
Ruling To Aid in Hurry
ing Action.
Washington, March 4 The :
next step in President Wilson's j
fight to dispose of armed ship
agitation in congress has been !
postponed until Monday orj
Tuesday.
Following a conference, early i
today, of administration lead-, j
ers it was announced that
yote would not be forced in the j
House today. j
While the rules committee is j
meeting this afternoon to i
frame a rule to table the Mc
Lemore resolution to warn
Americans off armed ships, it
is believed that there will be no
vote until Tuesday.
Majority Leader Kitchin no- :
tified members, shortly after
noon, that they would not be
needed" to vote until Tuesday.
The rule to be framed today
by the riles -committee "wilt be
brought up1 at the earliest op
portunity and immediate dis
position of the subject by a big
majority is expected. The For
eign Affairs committee already
has agreed upon the resolution
that will be brought in.
Administration officials said today 1
that virtually all Senators who voted
yesterday to table the Gore resolution ;
were voting for the President's pol
icy and that should the House -fa.il j
to vote to uphold the President in de- j
cisive form, the fight might be car- j
ried- back to the Senate for a direct :
vote to defeat the - McCumber reso-
lution warning Americans off armed
ships of belligerent nations. They
express confidence that complete -vie-
tory would follow such a course.
- To claims of a mixed victory in :
the Senate yesterday and to the con- ,
ten.tions of anti-administration forces .'
that the Senate evaded on voting on
tabling the Core resolution itself '
through a complexed parliamentary
situation, the administration leaders
today pointed to the official record
of the Senate proceedings. . ,
The vote was - on the following by
Senator James:
"I move that the resolution, and all
substitutes for it and amendments to
it, be laid upon the table, and upon j
that motion I demand the ayes and )
noes."
Upon that motion the Senate voted j '
and -it was carried, 68 to 14, and by :
that majority the Senate decided j
there should be-no legislation what
ever on the question of warning Amer
icans off armed ships. The leaders '
claimed that their victory was clean i
cut and complete.
Aroused by the publication of re
ports yesterday that President Wil- :
son, because of the strain of the for- '
elgn situation was considering resign- ;
ing from office, the White House to- '
day issued this- formal statement:
"When Secretary Tumulty's atten-,
tion was called to 'the story appear-,
