Paris, March 4. Tho French have
occunled tho highest part of tho

the village of Douaumont Is situated

tho Germans havo regained ground in
tho Immediate vicinity of Douaumont,

(JenniiiiH Confident.
Uerlln, March 4. Tho capture of the
town of Douaumont and the steady
successes of tho Germans in tho re
glon of Verdun seemingly confirm the
repeated predictions of the German
military experts that the army had
strength capable of penetrating tho
cntonto allied lines when tho time
came for it to do so. With charac
terlstlc audacity, it did not oppose
some weak section, but the strongest
fortress nt tho pivot of tho line, the
fall whereof would force tho aban
donmcnt of tho whole Atsno positions,
For Douaumont crowns a hill 318
meters high and was tho strongest
and highest fort of tho cistern sector
of tho outer ring of forts of the vor
dun defenses. Between Douaumont
and Verdun Interveno forts Souvlllc
3S5 meters high, and Saint Michel, 347
meters high and which belong to tho
inner girdle, but Douaumont com
mands a view of the city, tho heart of
which is less than Ave miles distant,
the fayorltc range of the German mo
bile mortars.
Tho successes were due to the Ger
man troops fighting under tho eyes of
tho Emperor William, but signs of the
weakening of tho French morales were
also evident, being shown in tho col
lapse of their resistance pouth of Ver
dun.
