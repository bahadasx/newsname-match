SPICER LAD DIES
FROM INJURIES
Accident At Spicer Sunday Re
sults Fatally For Eleven
Year Old Boy.
A sad accident that resulted fatally
occurred last Sunday afternoon at
Spicer, when Stanley Wilson, eldest
son of Mr. and Mrs. James Wilson,
was run over by an automobile The
lad suffered injuries from which he
died at ten o'clock oMnday evening,
died at ten o'clock Monday evening.
Together with other boys, Stanley
was playing ball on the main street
of the village One of the boys miss
ed the ball, and ran directly in front
of a car being driven by Olaf Par
sons of Whitefleld township. Parsons
slowed his car down, and at this time,
the Wilson boy in some way lost his
cap The cap fell directly in the path
of the moving auto, and seemingly un
aware of the approaching machine,
the boy backed into its path. Before
it was possible to stop the machine,
the wheels had passed over his chest,
crushing it.
Medical assistance was given the
injured boy, and for a time it seemed
that he would pull hru, and recover
from the injuries, but after suffering
all day Monday, the end came that
evening at about ten o'clock.
Stanley Wilson was eleven years of
age, and was the eldest son of Mr.
and Mrs. James Wilson, who, togeth
er with three brothers, Sydney, Ar
chie and Freddie, and a sister, Eve
lyn, mourn his tragic death.
The funeral was held this afternoon
at three o'clock from the Presbyerian
church. Rev. W. Bryn Jones of this
city officiating.
Mr. Parsons was in no way to blame
for the accident, as. he was powerless
to stop the car a second time, so
quickly did the unfortunate boy jump
in front of the machine.

Wm. Kjolsing In the Hospital
With Broken Leg and Other
William Kjolsing of this city 1* ly
ing in the Willmar Hospital with his
left leg broken between the ankle and
knee, his right one badly bruised, his
right arm hurt and his face cut In sev
eral places as the result of beln* run
down Monday evening by an automo
bile. The accident occurred on First
street, Just north of the Becker Ave.
crossing, a few minutes after eight
o'clock. Kjoislng was on his bicycle,
on his way home and as he approached
the Becker avenue crossing, he not
iced a car coming from each direc
tion on the avenue. However, he wa9
on the right hand side of the street,
and figured he was safe. Knowing the
car from the east would turn in close
to the right, if it turned at aU, he paid
but scant attention to that one.
The car coming from the west
which was driven by Harry Anderson,
Kjolsing figured would, If it turned,
follow behind the one from the east,
which reached the crossing first. In
stead of that however, Anderson cut
in close, and before the bicycle rider
hardly knew what was happening, he
was run down.
The "bumper" on the front of the
car caught him on both legs, just be
low the knees, and he was thrown
over the hood of the car. The car was
stopped and the injured man taken at
once to the Willmar hospital where
the leg was set in a cast and he was
given such other medical aid as he
needed.
Mr. Kjolsing had been down town,
to see about getting the contract for
excavating the basement for the new
wholesale fruit house to be erected by
E P. Stacey and Sons, and was on
his way home at the time the acci
dent occurred.
It is probable a suit for damages
will follow, as the victim was riding
on the right hand side of the street,
while the driver of the car made a
quick turn, on the left hand side of
the street. The fact that it was dusk
and hard to see, enters into the case,
too, as does the fact that the lights
on the car approaching from the oth
er direction may have temporarily
blinded the other driver.
