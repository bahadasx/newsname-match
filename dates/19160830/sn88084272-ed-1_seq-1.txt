BRAVE DUKE CAPTURES 100
GERMANS; KILLED IN BATTLE
Paris France, Aug. 30. The duke of
Rohan, killed in the battle of the
Somme. has had one of the most im
posing funeral seen in France during
the war. It was not only a tribute to
the heroic young nobleman, but a pub
lic recognition that the sons of the
old nobility of France are fighting
for the republic with the same ardor
that the old nobility fought for the
kings.
The Rohans are among the famous
old fighting families of France. They
fought at the siege of La Rochelle.
They were among the musketeers of
Louis XIV. One of them was known
as the "Young Hero" in the Seven
Years' war. Another became a bishop
and built the famous palace at Strass
burg. which is still an architectural
wonder. But while aristocrats. thv
shared the views of Lafayette and oth
er French noblemen admiring repub
lican institutions, and the present gen
eration of the family has been one of
the most enthusiastic supporters of the
republic.
The duke is credited with one of the
notable dare-devil undertakings of the
war. While out reconnoitering as a
cavalry lieutenant, he arrived along
with his orderly at an inn where a
hundred Prussian soldiers had taken
possession and were having a drunken
orgie. Warned by a peasant, the duke
would not turn back. Entering the
place brusquely, and speaking in Ger
man, in imperative tones he command
ed the party to surrender, as the house
was surrounded on all sides.
Surprised by the sudden apparition.
Interrogated by a firm voice of com
mand, and hearing the orderly with
his horse outside, the revellers resigned
themselves, gave up their arms, and
suhmitt d as prisoners, until a French
cavalry patrol warned of what had
occurred, arrived to escort the hundred
pnsonc j or a single hero.

Railroads Won't Accept
Perishables Cannot Be De

Chicago, 111 , Aug. 30. Railroads
throughout the United States, in antici
pation of the calling of a general
strike, are declaring embargoes on the
shipments of perishable foodstuffs and
livestock. Intending passengers, in
some instances, are being warned not
to start for destinations which they
cannot reach before next Monday, un
less they care to experience possible
inconvenience.
The Southern Pacific company, at
San Francisco, telegraphed all division
superintendents to warn passengers to
the above effect. The New York, New
Haven & Hartford announced it would
accept no shipments of freight which
could not be delivered before 7 a. m.
September 4.
The Atchison, Topcka & Santa Fe
placed an embargo on all shipments of
perishables and livestock, effective at

would accept shipments of nonoerisha
bles only subject to indefinite delay,
and added:
"Southern Pacific company cannot
accept perishable or livestock ship
ments destined to points beyond Port
land, Ogden and El Paso, and cannot
accept perishable or livestock ship
ments destined to Portland, Ogden or
El Paso or points west thereof which
cannot be reached by regular freight
train schedules by 7 a. m. Saturday,

San Francisco, Aug. 30. Neither the
Santa Fe nor the Southern Pacific ex
pects to cease operating its principal
passenger trains in the event of a gen
eral strike. It was announced today by
officials of both companies. Officials
in the operating departments said there
would be disarrangement of their J
freight trains and that many of them
would be' discontinued.
The officials expressed the belief
that the older engineers, conductors
and other trainmen who have what are
callel "seniority rights," would stay
with them.
Will nuln Fruit Crower.
C. M. Levy, president of the Western
Pacific said tonight:
"I cannot believe yet that there will
be a strike. We have made no special
preparations to run trains should a
strike come."
"If the embargoes by the railroads or
the strike, if It comes, should continue
for any length of time it will mean
ruination for thousands of California
fruit growers." was the declaration
made to night by Harris Weinstock,
state market director.

Big manufacturers today snamped
telegraph companies with messages
urging that their shipments be rushed
at once. Many of them authorized

Health Board To Meet.
A meeting of the city board of
health will be held this afternoon to
discuss thj infantile paralysis situa
tion in El Paso and decide whether or
not it is advisable to allow the
schools to open Friday. The care of the
cases which are known to exist here
will also be discussed and a number
of the members of the board will ad
vocate a private house to be converted
into a hospital for these cases, it is
understood. The health board is anx
ious to prevent the spread of the dis
ease here as it is feared that it will
become epidemic among the Mexicans
of the city. Several cases of children's
diseases are said to be under close
observation by local physicians for
fear the cases may be infantile par--alysis.

Notice has been received by W. C Mc

under 16 years old must get certifi
cates from their local boards of health
showing that the children had not been
exposed to infantile paralysis or had
lived in the same house where the dis
ease had been.
Should passengers taking passage on
these steamships come from towns
where no health board exists, the
steamship officials will accept the cer
