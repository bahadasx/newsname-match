DRAKE HEARING
COMES TO END
With the final examination of
Superintendents Savidge and Col
lins, in which little new evidence
was brought out, the Drake hear
ing was closed a few minutes be
fore 1 o'clock Wednesday after- i
noon, and the council adjourned
until call of the mayor to give the
commissioners time to consider
the evidence.
No arguments were made by at
torneys for either side, but
Drake's attorney, P. C. Sullivan,
told the council he claimed tbe
right to he heard before a vote is
taken.
He also asked a definite state
ment as to whether the council
DRAKE-He's Like
the Bridegroom and
the Fabled Coupler
By Mabel Abbott
Registration has brought a
large part of the population of
Tacoma to the office just across
the hall from the council cham
ber, within the past week.
If the chamber had been occu
pied by a moving picture show,
there would not have been seats
enough to accommodate all who
would have dropped in to see it
while in the city hall.
The Drake hearing, however,
has played to a small house thus
far.
And yet it has been a show
worth seeing. There has not been
the fast and furious action that
movie-trained tastes demand; but
there has been plenty of plot and
an all-star cast.
First and foremost, there Is the
council-chamber itself — long,
high, a little dingy, dominated by
the brilliant colors of a new flag
stretched on tbe wall above the
mayor's dais.
The other commissioners
sit hunched around their
long table, in the sagging at
titudes of men who have sat
in tlie same chairs for a long
time.
They hardly move, jet you
can tell that they are alive,
and awake, because every
once in a while they fire a
question at a witness, and
their aim is good.
There are only three men sit
ting at the council table now. One
chair is vacant —the chair that
Commissioner Drake usually oc
cupies.
To the left of the commission
ers, as the audience faces them,
are the attorneys, nervous, rest
less man who fidget and pace and
rustle their papers, and consult
■with each other in low tones.
Then there are the witnesses —
some of them; the others are out
side the rail in the audience, like
actors enjoying the show from
the wings.
But Collins and Savldge and
Arquett are ln the picture, three
different types of the technical

Close beside them are the re

Sometimes it is a laborer, with
the soil of his day's work still on
his clothing; sometimes a fore
man, digging out from his time
book the details which attorneys
and council demand; sometimes
the head of a department, match

he shifts his position a few in

He is like the bridegroom and
the car-coupler in the eld joke—■
the most inconspicuous object in
sight, and yet the proceedings
couldn't go on without him.
It is a queer picture, this
show that represents the at
tempt of a city to find out
what is th. matter with one
of its departments, or wheth

A picture that is worth
going home and thinking

BY JUDGE IIKMtV XKII-.
Father of Mothers' Pension*.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 30. —An

eive a pension

states now oper-
ating the mothers' pension sys
tem!
Judge Ben Lindsey ha agreed
to write the amendment and in
troduce it into the Colorado leg
lature and I will submit it to the
legislatures of the other 26 states.
The main object of this amend
ment It to relieve mothers of I
work during at least a part of the
period when the child needs the
nourishment that the mother
would not be able to give if it
were necessary for her to work.
Judge Lindsey went to Berlin
to Investigate the mothers' pen
sion system. He says Germany
has tried this pension plan and
found it both economical and
highly humane.
The plan would decrease
the number of weak children
that would "otherwise become
permanent public charges
and a burden to tax pay era.
The expense of maintalng in
stitutions for the care of feeble
minded and under-nourished chil
dren is becoming greater and
greater and will become an un
bearable burden to the taxpayers
of the states unless something is
done to prevent babies from be
ing weakened at birth by mothers'
Inability to give them proper
nourishment.
This amendment, when en
acted into law and put Into
operation will save the tax
payers millions of dollars now
spent to maintain institutions
for children anil save the
lives of millions of babies.
