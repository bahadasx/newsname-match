Sugar Has Mostly Been Shipped, Army His Supplies for Six
Months and Freight Waiting Shipment From San Francisco
Piers Would Carry City Comfortably for Some Time to Come
So far as its chief industry, the
production of sugar, is concerned, Ha
waii will find Itself fortunately placed
if a railroad utrike should occur. By
far the major part of its crop has
been already marketed and a part of
the balance will go to San Francisco
and will not need railroad transporta
tion to. reach Its destination.
Manager Allen M. Nowell of the
Sugar Factors Company ' said this
morning that more than 418,000 tons
of sugar had already been shipped
and arrived at destination. There was
14,000 tons which arrived in San
Francisco the middle of the month and
should reach New York before Labor
Day.v-:.
; "So far as the companies of the
Sugar Factors Company are concern
ed,? said Nowell, 'there Is only about
29,000 tons that would be affected
even if there be a strike and It last
as long as two months. There are
other sugars lnsmall amounts that
can well wait until In December or
until shipments from the new crop be
gin. -There ; is now on - the water
about 13,600 tons. Yes, the sugar in
dustry will be fortunate if a strike
comes that it did not materialize
sooner.... ' '

Whether the railroad strike" on the
mainland lasts a week or six months
is not bothering the regular army on
Oahor According to officials of ' the
aepot quartermasters office today,
there are rations enough on hand in
the army , storehouses to . feed all
troops on this Island, under ordinary
conditions; for 6 months, and in addi
tion, sufficient stores are kept for
sale to army post exchanges to last
for three months. : 2 V :
Among the ration articles raised,
manufactured, or grown in the terri
tory, and purchased locally, so that
the strike would have but little
effect on them, are fresh ' beef and
mutton, fresh potatoes, coffee, gran
ulated sugar,, fish and numerous .other
Items. . Enough flour Is also carried

Although not greatly- concerned
over the threatened mainland railway
strike, pineapple canners admitted. to

L. E. Arnold, superintendent of the.
Hawaiian Pineapple Company, thinks
that tr strike will last only a short
time, even if it comes, and he hopes
It will not come. '
"If the strike, continued indefinite

ned pineapple, especially to the east

undoubtedly the coast receiving sta

become congested.
"Congestion would be about the
only bad effect it would have on us,
however. Our rush season is past and
we are only working half days now
or full days with half crews."

drastic legislation will be considered later. The committee adjourned un
