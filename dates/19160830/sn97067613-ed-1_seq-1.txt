Closes the Most Successful Clear
. ance Sale We Have Ever Had
It is gratifying to us to see how much
faith the people have in this store and in the
merchandise and values it offers. It makes
us more enthusiastic in our business and en
courages us to try and keep at all times the
most complete assortment in every line of
wearing apparel and to offer the best values
that can be obtained, even at a big sacrifice in
our profits
At this time we have something left in
most every line which we wish to close out if
possible at a fraction of their real value, so
we will not have to carry them over to anoth
er season. So if you are looking for the big
gest bargains you can find in the line of cloth
ing, you had better come during this week
while you can get them here.
