STRIKE ORDER
EFFECTIVl
No Appearance of Possibil
enees Between Railwa
Leaders.
Washington, Aug. 2S-Labor Day,
Monday, September 4, is tho date
?xed for the strike in tho tentative
orders prepared by the railroad bro
therhoods and carried home hy the
members ol' the committee ol' (MO
when they left Washington yester
day.
lt was learned to-day that tho
brotherhood leaders decided negotia
tions here must end one way or an
other before Labor Day, and selected
the holiday witli a view to having
two million or more workers in all
lines of labor march in great dem
onstrations in favor of the strikers'
cause. .
Going Before Congress.
President Wilson to-night defi
nitely decided to go before Congress
to-m~'Tow or Wednesday to recom
mend legislation aimed to avoid the
threatened nation-wide strike or to
stop it, if it comes before Congress
can act. He worked until late to
night on his message in which be
will tell members of the Senate and !
House tho negotiations to date and
lay before them a definite legisla- j
tive program.
New l*roiH>sal.
The President reached this decis- :
ion after conferences nt the White !
House with the committee of eight
railroad presidents and the four
brotherhood heads, on a new propo
sal for settlement of differences sug
gested by the executives, and later
a prolonged discussion of the situa
tion at the Capitol with the mem
bers of the Democratic steering com
mittee of .the Senate.
The proposition of the railroad
executives was that an investigation
of all issues toe conducted by a com
mission to be named by tho Presi
dent, the Investigation to last for a
period of three or four months, no
action to be taken by either side in
the meantime, and at the conclusion
of the inquiry the situation to be
what it -now is, the employees hav
ing the choice of either arbitration
or striking. .
To Reply To-day.
The brotherhood heads promised
j a rejily to-morrow morning, and
there was every indication it would
be unfavorable.
When thc railroad brotherhood
heads went to the White House to
night the President not only laid be
fore them the pinn of the execu
tives, but strongly urged the with- j
dr a wal of a tentative strike order
sent out yesterday, subject to re
lease, calling for a walkout of the 1
400,000 brotherhood members at 7 !
a. m. Labor Day, September 4. This j
request was flatly refused, the lend- :
ers saying only the committee of
040, which left Washington yester
day, had power to recall the order.
Copies of Strike Owler.
Copies of tho strike order were
brought to the President's attention
after they 'had gotten .into the pos
session of the railroad executives.
It had been known that the mem
.bers of the commission of 640 car
ried home with them a tentative or
der, but no one outside the Brother
hood .Councils, had suspected that a
date bad been set, and the Presi
dent Is said to have been greatly
perturbed by the information. After
the refusal to withdraw the order,
be communicated with the railroad
presidents, who held a meeting that
lasted until late in the night.
In spite of tho apparent failure of
his efforts to bring the two sides to
gether, the President, was reported
to-night as being still hopeful of
averting a strike.
Legislative Program.
The legislative program prepared
for Congress includes the following
measures:
An eight hour day law for rail
road employees, so framed as to
give the railroads time to prepare
for it, and
A law patterned after the Cana
dian industrial disputes act provid
ing for Investigation of industrial
disputes on railroads by a commis
sion, and prohibiting strikes or lock
outs pending the outcome of the In
vestigation.
In addition to these measures
there are under consideration a res
olution to increase the revenue of
the railroads In case tho expenses
are increased, and a law creating
authority for the operation of tho
railroads under tho Federal govern
ment In event of a strike. The plan
to-night was to have the first two
measures Introduced as amendments
to the bill, which bas Already pass
ed the House, increasing the inter
state commerce commission from
seven to nine jnembers.
Tho Strike Order.
The strike order is brief. It is
addressed to all mcnibers of the four
brotherhoods, is ?igned by the vari
ous general chairmen and roads as
follows:
