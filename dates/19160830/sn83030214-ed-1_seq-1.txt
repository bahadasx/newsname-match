[From i Stfltf, I '('rr.*.r(-,n>i'*''t ''' ',,c Tribune]
Washington, Aug. 29.?Presidont Wilson ha> appealed to
Congress to save the country from the nation-wide railroao
strike set for 7 o'clock next Monday morning.
Admitting his own failure to effect a peaceful settktnent
of the controversy. the President urged the Senators and Rep*
resentatives in joint session this afternoon to enact legislation
designed not only to avert thia "tragical national caUmity."
but also to empower him to take control oi the roads lor mili- A
tary use, operate them for military purposes and draft into ttt* \l
military service of the United States such train crews and ad- "
ministrative officials as may be required.
It was a dispassionate, judicial address for the most part.
lt would have been wholly so except that, for one thing. thav
President depicted sharply and briefly the incalculable prio .
the loss anci suffering that would follow in the wake of a strike.
For another?and this seemed to many who heard it the mo-i
conspicuous feature?h-e espoused the cause of the brotherhoods
more frankly than before and east thinly veiled blame upon
railroad managers and executives.
