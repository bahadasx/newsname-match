BOILOIIIG TO DUIIIIELIOII
IIECIG LINKBETWEEH
The Ocala & Southwestern railroad,
which some months ago ceased run
ning its trains into Ocala over the
tracks of the Atlantic Coast Line, and
connected with the tracks of the Sea
board Air Line in the southwestern
part of the city, is no,w moving to
connect with the Seaboard near Dun
nellon, and the tracks of the Ocala &
Southwestern are being extended with
this in view.
The advantages to the Ocala &
Southwestern resulting from such
connection are obvious. What the Sea
board has in view cannot be learned.
It is probable that the Seaboard is
figuring on v extending the Tampa
Northern from Brooksville to Inver
ness, and coming into Ocala over the
Ocala & Southwestern from Dunnel
lon. The Seaboard now goes into In
verness from Dunnellon. It might bt.
that the Seaboard figures that it can
make the run between Jacksonville
and Tampa in a shorter time by going
from Ocala south by the way of Dun
nellon and Broolcsville. The connec
tions which the Seaboard now makes
at Wildwood, for Orlando, could be
made at Ocala. Besides giving the
Seaboard better access to the west
coast, it would relieve its freight
traffic from south Florida, all of which
is now brought north on the existing
main line.
The connections would place,. the
Seaboard in position to compete with
the Coast Line on the west coast.
DIDN'T DENY
CONNECTION
WITH DUNNELLON
No information could be obtained
today from officials of " the Ocala &
Southwestern. The officials did not
deny, however, that the connection
with the Seaboard near Dunnellon
would be made. J They simply stated
that they had nothing for publica
tion. ' '
SEVEN LINES TO CENTER IN
THIS CITY
In not many years there will prob
ably be seven main and branch lines
of railroad running into Ocala; the
main lines of the Seaboard and Coast
Line north and south; the Coast Line's
branch running to the west coast; the
Ocala and Southwestern, traversing
the southwestern section of the coun
ty; the Oklawaha Valley, which now
runs to Palatka, and which will prob
ably continue north to Jacksonville,
and south; through the southeastern
section of Marion county, to Boca
Grande; and the Tampa & Jackson
ville will probably builcf from EmatK
la into Ocala.
And there will be the straightening
and deepening of the Silver, Oklawa
ha and St. Johns rivers, giving Ocala
an adequate waterway to the Atlantic.
Furthermore, Congress has provided
for a "survey looking to the construc
tion of a ship canal from Silver
Springs, the headwaters of. the Silver
river, to Ocala. These transportation
facilities, plus a rich backcountry, as
yet undeveloped, will make this city
the largest inland city, and one of the
most jmportant in Florida.
