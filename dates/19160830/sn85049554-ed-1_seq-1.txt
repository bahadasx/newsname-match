P.
.Washington, Aug. 30.—President Wil
son .was making efforts today to have
railroad brotherhoods call off the strike
order effective Sept. 4. If the brother
hood leaders fail to comply the presi
dent may publicly ask the railway
workers that the strike order be re
scinded.
i^*5y Brotherhood officials after securing
copies of the proposed bill affecting the
later of railroad employes, went Into
conference with Secretary of Labor
wilaon.
Brotherhood heads Insisted after a
conference with Secretary Wilson, of
theTabor department, that they had not
been requested by President Wilson to
postpone the strike and that nothing
except a satisfactory settlement could
£$prevent a walkout.
Settlement Only Can Avert It.
i| "No power on earth except a satisfac
tory settlement can prevent a strike,"
l| said W. G. Lee, president of the train
men.
"We four heads certainly could not
obtain a postponement of the strike if
we wanted to, nor could we postpone it
if we received a message for such ac
tion from every one of the 640 members
|of the committee here last week. Presl
f-01. dent Wilson has not asked a postpone
ment, as we made it plain to him that
we are powerless to act unless a satis
factory settlement is made."
A. B. Garretson, head of the conduc
tors, and spokesman for the employee,
made a similar statement.
Besides conferring with Secretary
Wilson today, the brotherhood heads
talked with several congressmen at the
Capitol. They expect to confer with
President Oompers ,of the American
Federation of Labor, later today.
Brotherhood leaders who expressed
confidence of t^is enactment of the pres
ident's suggestion into law, now ap
1 peared to be less confident.
Unorganized Employes Protest.
abert T. Frazler, representing unor
'iinlsed railroad employes of the coun
try, sent to President Wilson a letter to
day protesting against the recommen
dation of the president to congress for
an eight hour day for railroad employes.
Mr. Fraxler pointed out that this legis
lation would not affect eight per cent.
"1 must respectfully warn you of the
events 3aro to follow." wrote Mr.
Fratler, "which will place the In
dustrial fabric of the nation in greater
jeopardy than at present. The 80 per
cent must of necessity organize for
protection."

Railroads Refusing to
Accept Freight of
Perishable Nature
Chicago, Aug. 30.—Railroads of the
nation, in view of the threatened rail
road strike, rushed preparations' today
to enforce an embargo on perishable
freight. Shipments of live stock and
perishables were refused by some roads
today others Issued warnings that
perishable freight which cannot reach
•Its destination by Sept. 2 will not be
acoepted. From Chicago orders were
flashed to ticket agents to inform pas
sengers that unless they reach their
destinations by Sunday night they
would be "subjected to perplexing de
lays."
Big manufacturers and business
houses swamped telegraph conftmnles
with messages urging that shipments
foe rushed at once. Many authorized
sending their orders by express. Sev
eral large commercial houses have re
called their traveling- representatives
from all part# of the country.
Associated Press dispatches indicate
that within forty-eight hours, unless
a delay In the strike Is ordered, embar
go orders will be effective thruout the
country.
Fruit Growers Face Ruin.
Harris Welnstock, state market di
rector of California, said that a strike
^f-.any duration meant ruin to thous
ands of fruit growers. A Sacramento
dispatch said picking of fruit in that
district had virtually ceased.
Commercial organizations thruout
the country are reported to be "hoping
for the best and preparing for the
worst."
It was rumored that little If any
pressure would be brought to 'bear on
the older conductors and engineers to
leave their places In case of a atrike.
The Erie road appealed directly to its
41,000 employes not to strike. The
Santa Fe made a similar appeal two
weeks ago, when the strike vote was
being taken.
-The Pennsylvania road took a poll
of its employes and reported that 90
per cent of them expressed the willing
ness to take the places of strikers.
Officials to Drive Engines.
Other roads have made similar In
quiry and It is said that more than
one high official who has risen from
the ranks is prepared to enter the cab
of an engine \o move necessary trains.
Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth
were reported making systematic ar
rangements for motor truck service.
Illinois, Ohio and Indiana, where the
interurban roads have been highly de
veloped, will use Interurban service to

brptherhoods, Which shall observe the
financial effect of the institution of thv
eight-hour day. Another amends the
Newlands act to make arbitration mort
effective. The third provides for gov
ernment operation of railroads for mil
itary purposes.
Wilson Bills to Ba Opposed.
Senator Cummins, of Iowa, one of
the progressive repubUcan: of the in
terstate commerce committee, voicing
opposition in the senate today to some
of President Wilson's proposals to
meet the railroad crisis, declared that
congress in search of legislation was
confronted by a "Scylla and a Charyb
dls, and that It would be interesting to
consider how far we can steer away
from one without .encountering the
perils of the other."
Senator Cummins insisted that com
pulsory arbitration was impractical
and unconstitutional.
The senator proposed as a possible
deterrent to industrial disputes, with
out advocating It or expressing any
opinion on the justness of it. legisla
tion which "would impose a modi
fled or partial restriction of the right
to strike In a combined way." which,
he said, would "make for industrial
peace and at the same time would not
unduly infringe upon personal liber
ty."
Compulsory Arbitration Impoasible.
"It Is my deliberate judgment," said
Senator ^Cummins, "that there is no,
prevention of strikes by law except to
deny laboring men the right to strike
in union or in concert. That Is to say
that it is unlawful to enter into an
agreement to strike at a prescribed
time and in a united bady. Thia with
out providing a sufficient substitute,
Is to practically prohibit union, when,
while the unions have notable func-
t'lonV. they "are"depirjyed"of"the 'right
legislation unless it Is accompanied
by relief for injustice."
Discussing compulsory arbitration,
Senator Cummins SQid there was no
stich thing never had been, or never
would be.
Injunction Brings Issue SquSrely.
The injunction Issued in Omaha
brings up squarely for the first time
in a labor dispute the effect of the
Clayton anti-injunction law. Brother
hood leaders claim injunctions are in
violation of the law.
The section which the leaders say
protects labor from injunction against
calling or enforcing a strike foliowb:
"No restraining order or injunction
shall prohibit a person or persons,
whether singly or In concert, from ter
minating term of employment, or from
ceasing to perform any labor or per
suading by peaceful means others
to work or abstain from work,
or from ceasing. to patronize or
to employ any party to such dispute,
or from recommending,, advising or
persuading others by .peaceful or law
ful means -so to dot- or from paying,
going to or withholding from any per
son engaged in eufih dispute strike
benefits or^ monies pr other things of

Chicago, Aug. 30.—The nation faces a
serious shortage of fresh meats in the
event of a strike, officials of the union
stock yards, the world's largest cattle
market, said today. The present sup
ply, It was said, will last only three
days.
Because of the heavy demand for for
eign export and the unusual heavy do
mestic call, the packers have been un
able to lay away a sufficient stock in
storage, Thomas E. Wilson, head of one
of the largest packing firms, said. The
embargo placed on the shipment of cat
tle and other perishables probably will
mean the crippling of the entire indus
try in America.
About 140,000 hogs are brought into
the market and 120,000 sheep each week.
All ltve stock quotations hardened to
day resulting from an active demand
due to the likelihood of a rSilroad tie
