Bees Got Drunk
Monroe Journal
A bunch of people were talking:
about cider drinking; and
what a "nasty" drunk it makes.
Mr. W. S. Lee said he was in the
country the other day and stopped
at the house of an old friend
of his who keeps many bees.
"How are the bees coming; on
this year?" he asked. "All drunk
and not working at all," was the
reply. "There are so many rot
ten apples this year, the little
rascals stav drunk all the time."
An Irishman entered a ticketoffice
one day and inquired the
fare to Chicago.
"Ten dollars," returned the
clerk, "but we are making a
special rate today. We'll sell
you a round-trip ticket for fifteen
dollars."
"A round trip? What do you
mean?" puzzled the Irishman.
"Yes," explained the clerk,
"you can go to Chicago and
back."
"Well," said Pat, "what do I
want to come back for, when
I'm already here?''

The old Scotch professor was

"No," he complained, "ve dinna

Picking up a pot of chemicals

"Taste of it gentlemen," he
commanded, s he parsed the

President Asks Congress for
| Laws to Prevent Railroad
Strike
Washington. Ancr 98 Prod.
dent Wilson tonight definitely
decided to go before congress in
, person tomorrow or Wednesday
to recommend legislation aimed
to avert the threatened nation
wide railroad strike or to stop it,
if it comes before congress can
act. He worked until late tonight
on his message in which
he will tell members of the sen- j
" ate and house the negotiations
to date and lay before them a
definite legislative pragramme.
The president reached this decision
after conferences ot the
White House with the commit
tee of eight railroad presidents
1 and the four brotherhood heads
on a new proposal for settlement
; of differences suggested by the
executives, and after a prolong
; ed discussion of the situation at
the capitol with the members of
. the Democratic steering committee
of the senate.
The proposition of the railroad
executives was that an investigation
of all issues be con1
ducted by a commission to be
; named bv the president, the in
' vestigation to last for a period
? of three or four months, no ac'
tion to be taken by either side
in me meantime, and at the con
^ elusion of the inquiry the situa1
tion to be what it now is, the
' employes having the choice of
' either arbitration or striking.
The brotherhood heads prom
ised a reply tomorrow morning,
5 and there was every indication
' it would be untovorable.
When the railroad brotherhood
heads went to the White
House tonight the president not
only laid before them the plan
of the executives, but strongly
5 urged the withdrawal of a tenta5
tive strike order sent out yester5
day, subject to release, calling
for a walkout of the 400,000
! brotherhood members at 7 a. m.,
5 Labor day, September 4. This
request was flatlv refused, the
leaders saying only the commit1
tee of 640, which left Washington
yesterday, had power to recall
the order.
Copies of the strike order
were brought to the president's
attention after they had fallen in1
to the possession of the railroad
executives. It had been known
: that the members of the committee
of 640 carried home with

for carrying merchandise, arrived
at Baltimore from Bremen
on July 9 with a cargo of dyestuffs
and mails. Her arrival
was hailed in Germany as the
beginning of a regular submarine
merchant service between
the United States and Germany

British blockade. It was announced
that she would be followed
shortly by the Bremen, a
sister ship.

one outside the brotherhood
councils had suspected that a
date had been set, and the president
is said to have been greatly
perturbed by the information.
After the refusal to withdraw
the order, he communicated
with the railroad presidents who
held a meeting that lasted until
late in the night.
