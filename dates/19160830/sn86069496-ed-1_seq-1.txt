ASAD LOSS TO COLUMBIA
Dr. B. F. Tayler, a Prominent
Physician, Meets With an Ac
cident, Death Fallowing.
BURIED AT OLD TAYLOR CHAPEL.
One of the most lamentable deaths
that have occurred in Columbia for
many years was the passing of Dr. B,
F. Taylor, last Wednesday morning
at 10:45. The intelligence of his de
mise spread a gloom over the entire
community, and it was hard to realize
that the man who was apparently in
his usual health, walking about town,
twenty four hours before, had gone to
meet his reward.
The immediate cause of his death
was an accident. He had gone out
auto riding with his daughter-in-law,
Mrs. James Taylor, and niece, Miss
Lenna Thompson, Mr. Alvin Lewis be
ing the chauffeur. On the Campbells
ville pike, four miles out of town, and
while Mrs. Taylor was receiving in
structions in managing the machine,
and while crossing an open bridge, the
car became unmanageable and drop
ped over the structure, a distance of
ten feet. The doctor was seriously
hurt, but at the . time it was not
thought that his injuries would
prove fatal; and as quickly as possible
he was conveyed to his residence in
this place. Physicians were with him
the remainder of the day and through
the night, doing all they could to lo
cate the trouble and bring about re
lief. Wednesday morning about 9 o'clock
the patient realized that he could not
live, and so stated to his family.
From that hour he began sinking, the
-end coming at 10:45.
Ii: his death not only those who
were near and dear to him sus
tained a great loss, but the entire
town and the county of Adair.
Dr. Taylor was born at Glenville in
this county nearly sixty-three years
ago, his birthday being on the 18th of
November, his death being less than
three months before that date.
At seventeen years of age he com
menced the study of medicine under
his uncle, Dr. TJ. L. Taylor, in this
place, and after reading a year he en
teredthe Louisville University, ajid
in due course of time he graduated
from the institution, and located at
East Fork, Metcalfe county, where he
soon built up a large and luciative
practice, and when he removed from
that place to Columbia he was per
haps one 01 the best known men in
Metcalfe county.
He was a second son of George M,
and Mary J. McCIaiu Taylor, who
preceded him. to. the grave many years
ago,
..The deceased was not only a sue
cessful physician, but a fine business
man, accumulating a considerable es
tate.
He -was an enterprising man a liberal-supporter
to every move looking
to the interest of Columbia. He was
also a very kina man, ana was ever
ready tc help the unfortunate.
His wife was Miss Mattie Pendle
ton, to whom he was married at East
Fork when the deceased was twenty
years old. One son, Dr. James Taylor,
was born unto them no other chil
dren. The father, mother and son
"were very devoted, and were never
separated only when the physicians
were out in their practice, hence the
death of the father is heart rending
to the wife and only child. No child
could have fonder parents than the
Asvotion manifested by Dr. Taylor and
kif companion for their daughter- in-
law, Mis. James Taj tor, a&d she too'
bH sustained an irreparable loss.
Besides the wife and son Dr. Taylor
leaves three brothers, Thomas, Bruce,
a&A Dr. W. S. Taylor and one sister,
Mrs. McMaham, of Metcalfe eounty,
all of whom have the deepest sympa
thy f this entire community.
When quite a young man Dr. Tay
kr made a profession of his faith in
Christ, united with the Methodist
OtwMh, living consistently with his
ion until the final dissolution.
faaeral services were held in
i Methodist church, before a large
ot relatives and frleads, at
11 e'ejetJc a. . Thursday. Intro-
r Remarks, paying tribute, were
made by Revs. W. R Wagoner and
W. C. Christie, and the discourse,
which was beautifully worded, by
Rev, S. G. Shelly, who had known the
deceased ior fourteen years.
After the discourse the congrega
tion took a farewell look at the re
mains, the funeral procession starting
Immediately thereafter for the bury
ing grounds, near Glenvllle.
' The floral offerings were beautiful.
Card of Thanks.
Mrs. Mattie Taylor and Dr. and
Mrs. James Taylor desire to extend
their heartfelt thanks to the many
who came to their assistance in the
recent death of husband and father.
The people about Cane Valley, near
where the accident occurred, were es
pecially kind and attentive, and also
the residents of Glenville where the
interment took place. Many of the
friends of Dr. Taylor, deceased, who
reside at East Fork, heard the intel
ligence of his demise with sorrow,
and were here to pay their last re
spects to the one who had been their
steadfast friend. The floral offerings
which were sent- in by lady friends of
the family were beautiful and affec
tionately appreciated. Such kindnesses
as were bestowed will never be for
gotten by a weeping companion, son
and daughter, and may God bless
them all is the prayer of the stricken
family.

SKETCHES.
W. R. Lyon.
The subject of this writing has been
on the road longer than any other
man who travels for groceries, in this
section of the State, and perhaps is
blessed with mere vitality than any
one of his competitors, and they are
numerous. It is not uncommon for
him to visit Colunfbia in the after
noon, "work the town, then go to his
home in Campbellsville to spend the
night. His many years on the road,
perhaps twenty-five, has enabled him
to build up a large acquaintance, call
ing his customers by their given
names, and his friendly handshakes
have built up a large trade. He is a
native of this place, but has been a
citizen of Campbellsville tor more
than thirty years. He had but little
of this world's goods when he first be
came a commercial salesman, but his
satisfactory manner of doing business,
tied his friends the closer. Econom
ical, but supporting his- family com
fortably, he has been enabled to "lay
up for a rainy day" so to speak, and
to-day he owns a delightful home and
forty or fifty acres of meadow land in
the suburbs of Campbellsville, and is
also a partner in the large establish
ment of Buchanan, Lyon Company, in
his home town. His residence and
ground attached are valuable, and he
has it well stocked- His grandfather,
Robert Lyon, was one of the most
courageous men. in Adair county.
He was not quarrelsome,
having a good word for every
person he met, but he was firm and
determined when he undertook to
carry a point, so much so, that when
a young man he was nick named
"Tiger," and it remained with him
until death, which occurred at the
age of eighty-six. Will Lyon's father,
J. -D. Lyon, inherited his lather's dis
positionkind and affableubub deter
mined So it is with W. R. Lyon.
When he starts out to sell a certain
amount of goods in a month, he works
day and night until the goal is reached
All of Mr. Lyon's competitor have
the utmost respect for him, clue to
courteous treatment. We have never
heard one of Mr. Lyon's compeditors
speak only the kindest of words of
him, hence he' numbers his close
friends by the hundreds Mr. Lyon
represents H. Wedekind & Co., Louis
ville, and the firm has not in its em
ploy a more -valuable man. May he
live long, anoTcoritinue to bring hap
piness to'those to whom he is bound
by ties "of blood.

the cause of the tragedy. Before tak

Items from Hatcher.
Five and one-half acres of land be
longing to the Turner heirs, Camp
bellsville, was divided into lots and
placed on sale Thursday. Phillips &
Rogers were promoters of the deal.
They divided the plot into 55 lots, 25
feet front. The total sale amounted
to $10,587.50. All of the lots were
sold to people of the town with the ex
ception of thirty, which Col. R. L.
Faulkner, Coburg, purchased. " This
property Is in the heart of the pop
ulated section, and is the last desir
able plot to be offered. The pur
chasers of the lots constitute the best
citizenship of the town, and' before
long several will begin to erect mod-
eru residences. Our county takes a
great deal of interest In the upbuild
ing up of its capital.
Our corn prospects are unusually
good. Tobacco Is better than average
years. Hogs and cattle are scarce,
but a few now realize more than in
former years. Watermelons of the
very best quality are plentiful and
bringing good prices. Every one is
satisfied except pie huntersand chron
ic grumblers.
We hope prejudice and ignorance
will not get the better judgment of
the voters at the coming election.
