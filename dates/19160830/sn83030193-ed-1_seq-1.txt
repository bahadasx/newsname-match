Would Inaugurate Distributing
System, Says Commis
sioner Dillon.
"DON'T WORRY," HESAYS
Could Bring in Supplies From
Nearby Zone by Plan Al
ready Devised.
The Inauguration of a great railroad
strike, which would bring a marked
shortage In certain food products and
a delay in dellvtry of others, would
not, according to Commissioner Dillon
of the Rtato Foods and Markets De
partment, cause anything approach
ing famine In the city.
"The situation would be serious,
without question," Mr. Dillon said to
day, "but New York need not be wor
ried about It. The state of affairs la
not so serious as offhand figures
might seem to Indicate. Primarily,
hunger knows no law, and we'd get
food here, you may rest assured of
that.
"I havo a plan practically worked
out I'd only need an hour to get It
In motion whereby I am sum the
people of this city could get food at
prices lower than they'vo ever bought
it In all their lives. And this, too.
while. a great railroad strike Is on.
There would bo n shortage In many
of the perishable articles of food
milk, for example within two days
after tho rallroadn shut down. Wo
would feel this as long an tho strike
lasted, and It would bo necessary for
consumers to do with less.
"But, to encourage the peoplo of
the city, let me sav that In the matter
of keeping up the supply of food,
Now York has all Ixng Island, a
largo part of New Jersey, and a tract
of fifty miles wide on each sldo of 'tho
Hudson River from which to draw.
Steamboat aervtco and motor truck
service would bring foods to the city
by the ton and at only a slight ad
vance above present prices.
"Then, too, wc have fresh fish at
our very door. We're prodigal, even
contemptuous, of our fish supply. Wo
pay about 20 cents a pound for llsh
which costs the dealer who stores It
about 4 cents a pound, and when we
get It It Isn't absolutely fresh. It we
took to our fish supply wa'd be ablu
to cut down one-tenth of tho meat we
consume.
TO BRING IN MEAT BY PARCEL
POST, HI8 PLAN.
"It would be difficult to got me it
here In case of a strike, although tho

comparatively small packages, as I
