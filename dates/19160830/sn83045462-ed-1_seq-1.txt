KANSAS FOR G.O. P.;
IS 0. K. OTHERWISE
That Is View Taken by De
spairing Democrats of the
Sunflower State.
ROLLING IN PROSPERITY,
BUT ON TOES POLITICALLY
j
Kansans Sympathize With President,
But Republicanism Is Bred in
Their Bones.
BY N. o: MESSENGER.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., August
3?-?Some yeafs ago a distin
guished Kansas editor wrote a
notable editorial headed" "What's
the Matter With Kansas?" You
remember it. It went the rounds
of the press and the changes were
rung on it for weeks.
If Mr. Will Allen White should ask the
question now, the answer of despair
ing democrats would be, "Nawthin* ex
cept the blamed state is going re
publican," and that's the truth.'
Father of Prosperity.
Outside of that, there is nothing the
matter with Kansas. Looks as if Kan
sas were the father of prosperity itself.
A succession of bumper crops and big
prices for cattle, hogs, alfalfa and
the kindly fruits .of the earth have
made the material conditions plump
as a partridge. They say facetiously
that the locomotive engineers on the
overland trains complain that they
they can't see the semaphore signals
for the dust raised on the country
roads by the farmers' automobiles.
Yet in Kansas this condition is not
making for political apathy, as in
some other states, possibly for the
reason that political activity is in
digenous to Kansas and perennial in
crop bearing. Anyhow, Kansas at
present is "on its toes" politically and
they are republican heads that are
showing greater numbers above the
crowds.
Reunion Accomplished Fact.
Reunion of the progressive and repub
licans is a fact accomplished and be
yond dispute or disparagement. Henry
J. Allen, who ran for governor on the
progressive ticket In 1914. and polled
$4,000 votes, is stumping the country
for Hughes, and predicts Kansas will go
for Hughes by 80,000. William Allen
\\ hite probably will support Hughes in
the end, although he does not And him
at present an ideal candidate. There
was only one real militant bull mooser
left, Victor Alurdock, and he has gone
to China to get some new material for
the Chautauqua circuit against the time
when a lot of former politicians will be
looking for gate receipts. Kansas at
present is just naturally a republjc?in
state because there are more voters, men
and women, of that political faith than
of any other. The fact was demon
strated in elections and primaries in the
past four years.
In 1912 there were 143,000 democrats
and 194.000 combined progressives and
regulars at the polls.
Women Increase Ratio.
By 1914, after women were admitted
to suffrage, the ratio of republican
gain increased. Capper, republican
candidate for governor, received 209,
000 votes against 161,000 for the demo
crat and 84.000 for the progressive
candidates. The latest straw indica
tive of conditions was the August pri
mary for selection of gubernatorial
candidates. Republicans to th* number
of 138.000 went to thf* primaries for I
the lone republican candidate and the
two democratic candidates drew out
only 47.000 democrats.
With the preponderance of republican
votes the G. O. P. hope to make a rlean
sweep of the delegation in the House
of Representatives and elect the eight
representatives. However, more con
servatice estimates here jrive the dem
ocrat a good fighting chance in the
second, fourth and sixth districts. TJie
second district especially is thought to
afford the democrats the best fighting
ground.
"Is there, then, no democrat senti
ment in Kansas?" may be asked. Th?
answer would be there is unquestion
ably plenty of Wilson sentiment in the
sunflower state, and the democrats are
pinning their forlorn and rather at
tenuated hopes upon that, and that
mainly.
Sympathy for President.
"He kept us out of war," echoes free
ly over the prairies and among the
woman voters. He draws sympathy for
the problems he has had to face, and
even republicans don't like to hear him
criticised too severely. Lambasting the
President does not sit well with Kan
sas, and local politicians do not indulge
in it. Not that the administration's
course is by any means held infallible,
but a kind of sportsman spirit of fair
play induces to the feeling that Presi- 1
dent Wilson has had more than an j
ordinary share of troubles to shoulder. !
The farm credits bill is acceptable, but
it hasn't got under way sufficiently to
make it a trump card.
President Wilson is a great deal
stronger than the democratic party, but
these Kansas people have their repub
licanism bred in their bones from sires
who "voted as thejf shot," and republi
can policies are as well understood as
the catechism and differentiated from
democratic teachings readily as high
church Episcopalian doctrines from
hard-shell Baptists.
Interest in Freight Kates.
In this region the first effect of the
President's efforts in behalf' of the
railroad workmen is beginning to sim
mer in the political pot. The past four
or five days have shown widespread in
crease of discussion of the two sides
of the question in their possible bear
ing upon President Wilson's political
and personal popularity.
The point is tins: Out in this country,
where every farmer and merchant is
well posted on the thoroughly organ- i
ized fight which has been waged j
against proposed increases of freight I
rates from time to time, is the home
of the opposition. Any proposition to
increase wages of railway employes,
with the farmers and merchants to be
ultimately In the position of "Jones,
he pays the frtight," strikes a tender
spot at once. Politicians are very un
easy over the outlook, which, to their
minds, looks very much like borrowing
from Peter to pay Paul, with quite as
many Peters as Pauls, if not more, to
be heard from at the polls when the po
litical reckoning come*.
LAWS TO AVERT
SIMM
Senate Interstate Commerce
Committee to Commence
Hearings Tomorrow.
OFFICIALS OF BOTH SIDES
INVITED TO BE PRESENT
Three Bills Under Consideration
Which It Is Hoped Will Halt
Action in Pending Crisis.
The interstate commerce committee
of the Senate adopted a resolution to
day providing- for hearings on proposed
railroad legislation in the impending
strike crisis tomorrow, beginning* at 9
o'clock in the morning.
Railroad presidents and managers,
officials of the railroad brotherhoods
and representatives of the shippers
were invited to appear. Each side is
to be given three hours in which to
discuss its views" of legislation pro
posed by President Wilson to prevent
the strike and to provide for operation
of trains if the strike comes.
Three Bills Considered.
The committee had under considera
tion tentative drafts of three bills.
One covers the proposed eight-hour
day and creates a wage commission of
three members, two to be recommend
ed respectively by the railroads and
the -brotherhoods, which shall observe
the administrative and financial effects
of the institution of the eight-hour
day.
The second would amend the New
lands act to make arbitration more ef
fective, after the Canadian principles.
A third provides for government op
eration of railroads for military ne
cessity.
? The tentative draft of the bill to es
tablish an eight-hour day is as fol
lows:
Bill for Eight-Hour Day.
"First, beginning (date left open),
eight hours shall be deemed the meas
ure or standard of a day's work for
the purpose of reckoning the compen
sation for services of all employes who.
are now or may hereafter be employed
by any common carrier by railroad
subject to the provisions of the act
of February 4, 1887, entitled 'An act to
regulate commerce,' as amended, and
who are now or may hereafter be ac
tually engaged in the work of operat
ing trains in transportation of persons
or property on railroads, from any state
or territory of the United States, or the
District of Columbia, to any other state
or territory of the United States, or the
District of Columbia, or from one place
in a territory to another place in the
same territory, or from any place in
the United States-to an adjacent for
eign country, or from a:.y place in the
United States through a foreign coun
try to any other place in the United
States.
"Second, the President shall appoint
a commission of three, to be known as
the wage commission, two of whom
shall be persons recommended respec
tively by the railways and their em
ployes. The commission shall observe
the administration and financial effects
of the institution of the eight hour
standard work day as above defined
during a period of not less than
months nor more than months, in
the discretion of the commission, and
within days thereafter shall re
port its findings to the I'resident and to
Congress.
?The President shall transmit the
report of the wage commission to the
interstate commerce commission, which
shall accept the findings of the wage
commission, unless cl^irl# erroneous,
and upon these findings, and such other
facts as it may consider germane, the
interstate commerce commission within
days from the receipt of the j
report of the wage commission, shall I
reach a decision as to what extent, if
any, the change in the standard week
day necessitates an increase in t^-.e
freight rates of the railways affected in
order to conserve their efficiency and
secure a fair return on the capital in
vested. ?
Wages Not to Be Reduced.
"Third, pending the report of the
wage commission and the decision of
the interstate commerce commission, as
above provided, and tri a period of
days thereafter, thcompensation of
railway employes subject to this act
for a standard eight-hour work day
shall not be reduced below the present
standard day's wage, and for all serv
ices in excess of eight houro such em
ployes shall receive not less than the
pro rata proportion of the compensa
tion received for the standard eight
hour work day.
"Fourth, the wage commission shall
also study the problems of the com
pensation for services of employes en
gaged in the operation of trains and
the service of interstate railroad trans
portation throughout the states and
territories of the L'nited .States and the
District of Columbia, for the purpose of
determining whether, in the Judgment
of said commission, power to fix and
regulate the wages of such emploves
ought to be vested in some public body
;uid it shall report its findings in this
behalf, together with its conclusions
and recommendations thereon, to the
'"ongress and to the I'resident not later
than .
"Fifth, any carrier violating any
provision of section three of this act
shall be liable to a penalty of not less
than 1100, and not exceeding $1,000 in
respect to each employe whose com
pensation is afTected by such violation
which penalty shall accrue to the
L nite<I States, and may be recovered
in a civil action brought by the United
States."
Amendments proposed to the exist
ing arbitration law include the follow
ing: ,
Amendments to Arbitration Law.
"If the board of mediation and con
ciliation Is unable to Induce the parties
to submit their controversy to arbi
tration. It shall be referred to a board
of Investigation, and' it shall be un
lawful for the employer or employers
to declare or cause a lockout or for
the employes to declare or cause a
strike on account of the controversy
prior to and during mediation and con
ciliation or during the investigation of
said controversy and the report theron

WAITING FOR A LAW TO PREVENT THE STRIKE.
M'LEAN ESTATE ^
TO GET POST STOCK
Court Authorizes Purchase of
John F. Wilkins' Interest
at $469,800.
Justice Siddons of the District Su
preme Court today signed an order au
thorizing the American Security and
Trust Company^, executor of the es
tate of John R. McLean, to purchase,
for $469,800, the interest of John F.
Wilkins in the Washington Post Com
pany. Mr. Wilkins owns 270 shares,
and the price to be paid is $1,740 a
share, the amount set by Mr. Wilkins
at which he would either buy the Mc
Lean holding yf 320 shares or sell his
own interest. ?
To afford the executor capital to com
plete the purchase the court authorized
the trust company to sell United States
bonds of the par value of $500,000 be
longing: to the estate, or such other se
curities as in the sound judgment of
the trust company could be advanta
geously sold. The executor may use a por
tion of tiie cash of the estate and sell
only such securities as may be neces
sary to raise the purchase price for the
Post stock.
Suggests Modification.
There was no opposition to the grant
ing of the requests of the executor by
counsel for the son, Edward By McLean,
Attorney Wilton J. Lambert, one of his !
lawyers, suggested to the court a modi
fication of the decree as prepared by
Attorney Frank J. Hogan for the ex
ecutor. The decree, as suggested, had
limited the power of sale to the govern
ment bonds, and Mr. lArnbert suggested
that other securities might be included
in the discretion of the trust company.
Attorney Hogan readily assented to the
modification.
In explaining the necessity for hold
ing a large amount of cash to tho
credit of the estate Attorney Hogan
told the court that a total of $51,000
in claims had already been presented
against the estate. Of this sum, he
said, $30,000 was for physicians' bills
incident to the last illness of Mr. Mc
Lean.
Former Senator Bailey and Attorney
George P. Hoover were in court to rep
resent E. B. McLean. Attorney J. J.
Darlington is associated with Mr. Ho
gan for the trust company.

PRESIDENT WARNED
OTHERS MAY STRIKE
/
Representative of Unorganized
Railroad Employes Com
municates by Letter.
i
Through their lone representative In
Washington, the 1.500.000 or more rail
road employes not members of brother
hoods are demanding that If an eight
hour law be passed by Congress dealing
with railroad employes it shall cover
them also.
They declare that they have no or
ganization to look after their interests
and that it is unfair that One portion of
railroad employes, simply because they
are organized, should be favored as to
i-ahorter work hours and greater pav
. while the vast majority are given no
I consideration at all.
. Robert T. 1-razier. jr.. of Nashville
. who came to Washington three weeks
? ago seeking to see President Wilson to
, lay before him the petition of what he
declares to be SU per cent of the railroad
i employes, and %, ho has failed to get a
conference with the President, today
j sent to the \\ hite House a letter. In it
J he warns the President that a conse
quence of failure to consider the SO per
?cent will be the organization of these
employes into unions and demands upon
railroads for mo.-. pPy that will make
the railroad situation generally more
serious in the future.
The letter is as follows:
Text of Letter to President.
"As a representative of the 80 per
cent of the railway employes of the
I country, the men who, at all times,
have been loyal to their companies
and to their country, ar.d men who are
not now making any demands relative to
hours of service or wages, but who
stand to suffer loss only as a result of
strike methods Resorted to by the 20
per cent, the trainmen, or as a result
j of the readjustment of wage scales
j by any methods wherein they are not
represented, I came to Washington
three weeks ago, bringing with me
I petitions from my associates In the
I service of the Xnshville, Chattanooga
and St. Louis railway, bearing 6,000 sig
natures.
"These have since been augmented
| by petitions from the employes of other I
. roads to the number of 105,000 now
in your hands and between 100,000 and
|200.000 more which I am advised are
| expected to be forwarded to you short
ly.
j "I have sought, and patiently awaited, !
for these three weeks, an opportunity
personally, to present these, our peti-I
lions as citizens of the republic to its
first citizen, and it is with regret that
I must now report to them that
throughout this long period, given over
almost entirely to the subject, you have
not found it convenient so to receive
their representative.
May Affect Only 20 Per Cent.
"In the second paragraph of the legis
lation yesterday recommended by you to
Congress I see the following language:
'The establishment of an eight-hour day
as the legal basis alike of work and of
wages in the employment of all railway
employes who are actually engaged in the
work of operating trains in interstate
transportation.' It would seem from this
that the legislation recommended would
operate only to the benefit of the 'em
ployes actually engaged in the work of
operating trains in interstate transporta
tion' (the 20 per cent), and that the great
majority of railway employes, heretofore
unorganized and unheard of. would be
without protection or recourse under the
law.
"If this is the design of the propesed !
law. and it is enacted so. 1 must re
spectfully warn you of the event sure to
follow, and that at no great date, which
will place the industrial fabric of the na
tion in greater jeopardy than it at the
present stands?the 80 per cent must of
necessity organize and present their de
mands for recognition and protection.
"We prefer, however, as individual citi
zens. moving In unison, to ask the pro
tection and recognition from our gov
ernment first, and feel confident that you.
Mr. President, as its chief executive, will
see that such recognition and protection
is accorded us."
Railroads of Nation Generally
Announce Expected Inability
to Handle Shipments.
PASSENGERS ARE WARNED
OF PERPLEXING DELAYS
Big Communities Prepare to Wrestle
With Problem of Food Supplies
Over a Protracted Strike Period.
Railroads of the nation rushed
preparations today to enforce the
embargo on perishable freight.
Shipments of livestock and per
ishables were refused by some
roads today; others issued warn
ings that perishable freight which
cannot reach its destination by
Saturday, September 2, will not
be accepted.
From Chicago, the railroad cen
ter of the country, orders were
flashed ticket agents to inform
passengers that unless they
reached their destinations by
Sunday night they would be sub
jected to "perplexing delays."
Associated Press dispatches
from all parts of the country in
dicated that within forty-eight
hours, unless a delay in the strike
is ordered, embargo orders will be
effective on practically every rail
road in the country.
What this means to traffic and
revenues is said by the railroad
men to be shown by the statement
of an official of the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe railroad,
who said the embargo would re
duce the traffic of the road one
third.
Harris Weinstock, state market di
rector of California, said that a strike
of any duration meant ruin to thou
sands of fruit growers. A Sacramento
dispatch stated that picking of fruit
in that rich district had virtually
ceased.
Commercial and industrial organiza
tions, as well as individual firms and
corporations throughout the country,
were reported "Hoping for the best and
preparing for the worst."
Railroad men hoped that many mem
bers of the brotherhoods would not
obey the strike order.
The Erie road appealed directly to its
41,000 employes not to strike. The
Santa Fe made a similar appeal weeks
ago, when the strike vote was being
taken. Two ore roads in northern Mich
igan and Minnesota?the Duluth, Mis
sabe and Northern and the Duluth and
Iron Range?will not be affected by
the strike, it was stated, as the train
crews, largely members of the brother
hoods, are said to have assured their
employers that they regarded their
agreements with the roads as binding
and that they would not go out. This,
it was said, would assure continued
shipments of ore to the hungry mills
of the east.
Planning to Use Motor Trucks.
Pennsylvania mills were said to be
i planning to transport munitions of war
! by motor trucks to Lake Erie, there to
; be loaded on vessels to Europe.
I The Pennsylvania road took a poll of
! its employes and reported that 90 per
cent of them expressed' a willingness
to take the places of strikers.
Other roads have made similar in- i
vestigatlons. Minneapolis, St. Paul and
Duluth were reported making sys- i
tematic arrangements for motor truck j
service. Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
many other states where the inter
urban service has been highly devel
oped will use the electric facilities to
the limit. Interurban companies all
over the country were reported put
I ting every bit of available rolling
stock In shape for extra duty
1 Minneapolis millers said that their
mills would close within thirty min
utes after a strike becomes effective,
as they have no storage room for ad

Situation in New York.
NEW YORK, August 30.?Railroad
traffic, both to and from New York city,
showed feverish activity today In an
ticipation of a general strike.
It is estimated that before September
4, the threatened date of the tie-up,
this city w ill rid itself of a floating pop
ulation of nearly 350,000 and receive
home about the same number of resi
dents who have been on vacations.
Passenger traffic just before I,abor day
is always heavy even under normal cir
cumstances.
'? T'nless the situation changes radi
cally it is expected that eastern rail
roads will declare a freight embargo to
tike effect September 4.
Railroads Hope for Best.
Railroad ex4cutives here expressed
hope today that if a strike were called
they could run enough food trkins to
keep the city from privation. The city's
milk supply, they promised, would be
the tirst to receive cosideration.
The big milk companies have been
organizing to meet the situation ever
?ince the strike became imminent.
Drivers of milk wagons have been In
structed to make a census of babies on
their routes and they will be attended
to first The milk companies have ar
ranged to obtain hundreds of motor
trucks which will be used to collect
milk from the territory surrounding
New York if the regular milk train
service fails.
'NewtYork consumes 2,500,000 quarts
of milk a day. It la estimated that 25
per cent of this goes to babies and an
other 25 per cent to children -who de
pend largely on milk for food.

PRESSURE BROUGHT
ON BROTHERHOODS
TOPREVENTSTRIKE
Entire Weight of Government
Authority Fails to Swerve
Leaders of Railway Men.
PRESIDENT MAY TURN TO
WORKERS THEMSELVES
Senate Gets Its Machinery Heady
For Legislative
Action.
DIVISION IN THE HOUSE.
Two of Mr. Wilson's Proposi
tions May Encounter Barriers
Preparations For Walk-out ^
On All Sides.
The entire weight of govern
ment authority was pitted today
against four brotherhood leaders
in an apparently futile endeavor
to have them call off or postpone
the strike called for Labor day,
next Monday.
The President and other admin
istration leaders were using all
the force of their persuasion and
authority to bring about either a
postponement or abandonment of
the strike.
There were intimations that
should the labor leaders continue
adamant, President Wilson even
might make a public appeal to the
railway workers themselves to
direct their leaders to postpone it. ^
The Senate, with the determina
tion that if the strike was not
postponed it must be stopped by
legislative action, was preparing
its machinery toward this end.
The House, divided in opinion
as to the President's proposed
program of legislation, was wait
ing. Representative Adamson,
chairman of the commerce com
mittee, is said to have warned
Senator Newlands that two of the
President's propositions cannot
be passed in the House.
Brotherhoods Are Firm.
Legislation to provide for an eight
hour day and for a commission to investi
gate along the lines recommended by
President Wilson can be enacted in all
probability by both houses, but nothing
is probably feasible beyond those two
propositions, Representative Adamson
told Senator Newlands.
Mr. Adamson made himself absolutely
clear as to what he favored at this time.
He said he did not believe the other
propositions recommended by the Presi
dent. relating to compulsory arbitration
and consideration of increase in freight
rates' to meet the expenses of an eight
hour day, would pass either house. \
After a conference with Secretary of
Labor Wilson and otheF labor leaders the
heads of the four big brotherhoods de
clared positively that nothing but a sat
isfactory settlement of their demands
can now prevent the strike. It is un
derstood that those holding power of at
torney have taken a vote deciding that
nothing but the railroads' meeting the pro
posal made by the President and accept
ed by the brotherhood committee of 640
will have force to prevent the strike.
The fact that the strike will call out
not only the men who man the freight
I trains but those who are employed in the
' movement of passenger trains as well
I was emphasized today.
Both sides are going forward with their
plans for the strike and to meet condi
tions that will ensue.
Refuse to Accept Freight.
While government machinery was
humming today with strike plans,
there poured in from all sections of the
country telegrams that railroads were
declaring embargoes on perishable
stuff, refusing to accept freight with
guarantee of prompt delivery and
warning 'against passenger travel ex
tending past 7 a.m. Mcndav, the hour
set for the strike. These reports gave
a hint of the rigor which might be
expected from a general strike.
President Wilson was making efforts
today to have the railroad brother
hoods call off or postpone the strike
order effective September 4.
All the influences that could be
brought to bear were being utilized in
an effort to convince the leaders that
their action in calling a strike while
the negotiations still were proceeding
should be rescinded.
Confident of Success.
Commissioner Chambers of the fed
eral mediation board seemed confident
that efforts along this line would be
successful. Many of those close in *
touch with the situation thought it
could be -accomplished if Congress
promptly enacted the eight-hour day
feature of the President's legislative
program.
The first legal phase of the situation
jeveloped* with the temporary injunc
tion issued by a local court in Nebraska
restraining the conductors from calling
ar enforcing a strike on the Union Pa
cific. This brought up for the first time
the effect of the much-discussed Clay
ton anti-injunction act passed by Con
gress at the behest of labor. The
brotherhood leaders unreservedly ex
