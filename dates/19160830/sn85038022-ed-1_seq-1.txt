of the district In which they reside.
After school has begun, if there
should arise the need for transferring

President Submits Revised Arbitration
Plant To 4'onirrea Hallway
Heads Favorable To New
I' n.it rum.
Washington, August 29 President
Wilson, laying the railway strike sit
uation before Congress today with
recommendation for legislation, ad
vanced the crisis to a place where tho
next developments depend upon two
points. They are:
Whether the legislation lie proposes
can be passed?
it enacted will it be effective to pre
vent a strike already called for 7 a
m., September 4?
Neither of these questions can be
unswered tonight
The Brotherhood heads themselves,
announcing their intention to tin In
certain portions of the President's
ptogram, are at loggerheads over
wliethor its enactment would prevent
the strike.
The railway presidents, favorable
tn President Wilson's plans, in the
main, think it would make it difficult
for the strike to begin.
Developments Follow Quickly
Meanwhile, although negotiations
between the employers and men were
broken off today by the rejection of
the railway presidents' latest proposal
for arbitration, President Wilson is
continuing efforts to bring the two
sides together, on some form of agree
ment. Efforts which might well be
described as almost superhuman are
being exerted to that end.
When the Brotherhood leaders this
morning rejected the latest proposal
to the railroads and definitely set the
strike for Labor Day, without further
notice, President Wilson decided to
lay the whole situation before Con
gress. Before a joint session of the
House and Senate and with a solemn
recital of the distress and disaster a
strike would bring to the country, the
President proposed a plan of legisla
tion. This is the proposal in his own
language:
First Immediate provision for tile
enlargement and administrative re
organization of the International Com
merce Commission along the lines em
bodied In the bill recently passed by
the House of Representatives and now
awaiting action by the Senate; In or
der that the commission may be en
abled to deal with the many great and
various duties now devolving upon It
with a promptness and a thorough
ness which are with its present con
stitution and means of action prac
tically impossible.
Second The establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wagea in the employ
ment of all ruilway employes who are
actually engaged In the work of oper
ating trains in interstate transporta
tion. Third The authorization of the ap
pointment by the Prasident of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults In experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads; its effect in the matter
of operating cost, In the application of
the existing practices and agreement
to the new conditions, and in all oth
er practical aspects, with the pro-
Vision that the investigators shall re
port their conclusion to the Congress
at the earliest possible date, but with
out recommendation aa to legislative
action; In order that the public may
learn from an unprejudiced source,
just what actual developments have
ensued.
Fourth Explicit approval by the
Congress of the consideration by the
interstate Commerce Coipmission ol
un Increase of freight rates to meet
such additional expenditures by the
railroads as may have been rendered
necessary by the adoption of the eight
hour day, and which have uot been
offset by administrative readjustments
und economica, should the facta dis
closed Justify the Increase.
Fifth An amendment of the exist
ing Federal statute which provides for
the mediation, conciliation and arbi
tration of such controversies aa the
present by adding to It a provision
that, in caae the methods of accom
modation now provided for ahould
fall, a full public investigation of the
merits of every such dispute shall be
instituted and completed before a
strike or lockout may lawfully be at
tempted, and
Sixth -The lodgement In the bauds
of the executive of the power, In case
or uillilury necessity, to atake coutrol
or such portions aud such rolliag
stock of the rallwaya of the country aa
may be required for military use and
to operate them for military purposes,
with authority to draft Into the mili
tary service of the United Dtates vueh
train crewa and administrative, of-
ciala aa the clrouatataiices require
for their safe and efficient use.
MM. Ills WAY NOT HK IN I I MM.
TON T (END AY
If the strike or railroad trainmen,
engineers, conductors and firemen Ir.
called Monday morning, aa has been
ordered. according to dispatches from
Washington, there Is hardly a possi
bility that there will be any opening
o? the Republican State campaign
a' Islington Tuesday afternoon, aa
Charles E. Hughee, the Republican
candidate, will be marooned In Nash
ville, where he speaks Monday even
ing, without a chance of reaching I , i
lngton In time tn keep his engagement
there.
According to the plans, aa an
nounced by the committee In charge of
negotiations, a general strike of the
railroad operative becomes effective
at 7 o'clock Monday morning. Mr.
Hughes will be In Nashville Monday
evening, about 260 mllea from l.oxinr
ton by the shortest route. It would
be practically Impossible for Mr.
Hughes to reach Lexington from
Nashville by Tuesday afternoon, even
by automobile.
Present plana are for Mr. Hughes to
arrive in I-oxIriRton by special train
early Tuesday morning, coming frore
Nashville via Louisville over the L.
N. He is scheduled to leave Lex
ington for Cincinnati by special train
shortly after 6 o'clock Tuesday evening.
HAY Ml LARK KM II A HOD
Mr. H. S. Kills, local agent for the
U N , has received word that on
account of tho liability of a general
railroad strike occurring September 4,
