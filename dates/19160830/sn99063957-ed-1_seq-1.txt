PRESIDSNT'S LAST WORD
Washington, Aug. 30. '
'Ood
forgive you; I cannot."
President Wilson, it became
known today, thus concluded his
final interview with the rail
road executives nt the White
House yesterday when they
submitted their final proposi
tion rejecting every effort and
suggestion the president had
made for peaceful settlement of
their dispute with the employes.
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press, staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 30. President Wil
on today was exerting every effort to
aecure from the railroad brotherhood
leaders a withdrawal of their strike or
der, effective September 4.
Believing that congress is certain to
l.ii 8a legislation euch as the brother
JfmnTs are "demanding, administration
officials have pointed out the train
men would have nothing to gain by
striking and everything to lose. In
fact they say, if the men carry out
their strike orders while congress is ac
tually .debating on measures favorable
to labor, there would be a tremendous
reaction in the country against the un
ion men that might turn the entire
trend of events.
Thus far, however, the brotherhoods
have indicated no intention of rescind
ing their strike orders.
It is the hope and belief of admiuig-
trntion officials that, following the
Vresideut 's nction of yesterday, there
will be an imemdiate response from the 1
sountry, urging delay of any strike ae -
tion by the employes until congress has
uaa time to pass the legislation before
it.
The railroad strike, tying up every
piece o'f rolling stock in the country,
will be in effect Monday, brotherhood
men said today. The order includes
every brotherhood man in the United
States both in passenger and in freight
traffic.
While the freight men are the only
ones making deinnnds, the passenger
men are included in the strike order.
The reason that they also did not
make demands is that the eight hour
day now applies to passenger service,
while the pay is based on mileage, or,
on the slow trains, on a monthly guar
antee. The unions have decided formally
that President Wilson's legislative pro
gram will not alter their determination
to strike: prominent brotherhood men
reiterated today that only railroad ac
ceptance of the eight hour day. 10 hour
pay proposal, can head off the tie
up. Asked today if he had been directly
requested to postpone the strike, A. B.
Garretson, head of the trainmen re
plied "we have not" and gave the same
answer to a question as to whether he
h d postponed the strike.
fvnowin' when t' quit tallcin' is a
fine thing, but knowin' when t' leave is
till finer. The' nothin' like a good
front, either ia war or in th' resturint
business.

TWINKLE TROT TO BE
ALL BAGE THIS YEAR
Chicago. The " twinkle
trot," .a dance similar to fox
trots, will be among the newest
dances to become popular this
winter, it was decided Saturday I
at the convention o'f the Ameri-
can National Association of
Dancing Masters. The "Chinese
processional dance" and "gem
waltz" also will be among the
new novelties.
Social workers, pnstors and
society women will have an op-
portuuity to express their views
on the latest dances.
"We want the ministers to
know what is going on iu the
dancing ! world," said L. P.
Chrintensen, an officer of the
association. "In that event they
probably would not be hostile to
the art."
New classic dances were dem-
onstrated at the convention Sat-
urday by Mrs. P. N. Spaeder, of
Cleveland, and Miss I.ila Maple,
of San Francisco.

. As reason for asking the order, Ham

at that time the rules were amended

London, Aug. 30 Kaiser Wilhelm has
dismissed General Falkenhayu, chief of
the German general staff because Pal
kenhayu was opposed to sending troops
to the eastern front to meet a Ruman
ian invasion, according to The Hngue
correspondent ot the Exchange . Tele
graph today.
Field Mnrshal Von Hindenburg urged
that reinforcements be sent to Austria
and won the support of the kaiser with
the result that troop trains are now
rushing German soldiers to the defense
of Transylvania.
The change in the general staff
means the dismissal of 30 German gen
erals on both fronts, the most radio 1
shakeup in any army since the war le-
gan, the correspondent stated.
Many Changes Madt
London, Aug. 30. Radical changes ir
German military and diplomatic leader

ing Rumania's appearance in the war

Dispatches from Berlin today not
only confirmed "the dismissal of Gen
era! Faulkenhayn as chief of the Ger

Marshal Mackensen in all probability
win succeed von Hindcuburg in su
preme command of the Austro-German
armies on the Russian and Rumanian
fronts. Von Hindeuburg has been ap
pointed chief of the general staff, suc
ceeding Falkenhavn.
Despite his advanced age, General
Von Kluck may be recalled to active
service and given command of one of
the Austro-uermau armies that will at
tempt to stem the Busso-Rumanian in
vasion of Hungary.
There is no confirmation of a report
trom i lie Hague that both Foreign Sec
retnry Von Jagow and Under Secretary
Zimmerman tendered their resignations
after Rumania declared war. It has
been- learned from Berlin, hoWever,
thnt neither participated in the confer

mnnn-Hollweg nnd certain of his minis

news ot Rumania's action.
From Dutch sources it was reported
today that the kaiser already hnd order

according to Toons Pratt, special agent
of the road. If a strike is called it

by Louis W. Hill, president of the

day from Washington. In the party
were E. P. Ripley of the Santa Fe,
Hale Hohlen of the Burlington, receiv

ly began organizing their forces to
meet the impending strike.
Chicago Has Food
There is enough meat, egs and can
ned vegetables in cold storage here to
keep Chicagoans in food for a year in
case of a strike. The only danger is
an ice and coal shortage. Coal dealers
say the present coal supply will be ex
hausted within five days. With no
cool to generate cold air for refriger
ating houses the food supplies stored
in these honses would quickly spoil.
Artificial ice plants would be compell
ed to close.
An order to quit work at six a. m.

GENERALS
COMMISSION SUSPENDS
TRANSCONTINENTAL RATES
Washington, Aug. 30. The
interstate commerce commis
sion today suspended increased
transcontinental rates, recent
ly proposed by coast to coast
carriers.
The proposed schedules are
suspended to December 30, be
cause "the rights and privi

During the period of suspen
sion the commission will con
duct a thorough investigation
of the proposed rates.
The suspension followed hear
ings before tue suspension

By J. P. Yoder.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 30. The first for
mal effort of congress to rush through
legislation to prevent the strike of 400,-
000 railroad employes set for Monday
morning, ended temporarily In a quar
rel today when bitter charges were
made' that eertain senators are "at
tempting to make political capital out
of a disastrous situation."
The charges were made bv Senator
Robinson, Arkansas. They followed a
statement in committee by Senator Cum
mins and other republicans. These sen
ators, it was stated, declared that since
the date had been set and that a strike
apepars to be inevitable, there is no
need to ruah through hasty legislation
that might afterwards prove inadequate
to noid lor all time as law.
"The strike is not inevitable." Rob
inson was quoted as saying. "It seems
to me that at a time like this when the
nation is facing the most disastrous
industrial situation in our history, mem
bers of all parties should stand togeth
er regardless of party or personal nmbi

The meeting grew so stormv thnt the
committee adjourned the session after
passing a resolution agreeing to hear
the employes, the railroad managers nnd

however, the committee decided to meet

were being felt todny four days be

Probably never in the history of rail
roading have the big lines of the coun

presented. Many lines have already
put an embargo on all freight which
cannot be delivered before September
4. Shippers and buyers are making
frantic efforts to move goods, or lay in
an extraordinary supply.
Thousands of persons, on vacations,
or away from home on business, are
cutting their trips short.
The New York, New Haven Ic Hart

an embargo on freight In the enstern
district. The New York Central, Penn

New York, Aug. 30. The tenacles of
New York's great white slave traffic
reaches into the Orient for victims, ac
cording to the belief of Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Smith who is today in
vestigating the arrest of Lee Lai, a
Chinese woman.
The arrest, the district attorney be
lieves, may uncover a great traffic in
women of the Orient brought iiere
through Canada for immoral purposes.
Evidence that Chinese women are won
and lost daily at gambling tables has
been unearthed by immigration offic
ials. Indictments have been found against
18 men for trafficking in women. Po
lice officials believe -that at least
twenty more men soon will be under in
dictment, .... ;
Social circles may get a shock before
the investigation is over. The district
attorney's office is today Investigating
the operations of a man ' of social
standing, who is claimed to furnish
women for rich men,
A thirty page affidavit in the hands
of the district attorney discloses fea
tures of a dinner orgy given by a mil
lionaire artist, which may lead to ar
rests. The affidavit made by one of
the women "entertainers" shows that
a "September Morn" tabeleaux was
one of the bits of diversion. Other dis
closures made are said to be the most

Owing to the heavy traffic and car

realized that the railroads may not be

their extra orders prior to this week,

All produce houses and other firms
dealing in perishable goods were mak

is in effect, the food supply in the
large cities of the country will prob
ably not hold out more than a week, un

In the meantime all eastern roads are

UNLESS DELIVERY CAN

All Non Perishable Freight
Will Be Received "Subject
to Indefinite Delay"
San Francisco, Aug. 30. California,
fruit intcreses are threatened with se
rious losses as the result of an embargo
filaccd on perishable commodities and
ive stock shipments by the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe railroads. The
orders, growing out of the threatened
railroad strike, are effective today, and
just in the heavy shipping season, the
fruit interests of the country find them
selves with no means of handling their
rapidly ripening crops, . which will be
ruined if relief is not loctucoming
quickly.
Nor le the shipper tne only one in-
cenvenienced by the new peril. A mes
sage has been sent to all ticket agents
by Passenger Traffic Manager Charles)
S. Fee, of the Southern Pacific, in
structing them to advise pasengers that
they may experience delays unless they
can reach their destinations by Sunday
night.
The embargo order of the Southern
Pacific follows:
"On account of the Impending strike.
all shipments of non-periBhable freight
for all destinations reached by this com
pany and its connections will only be
accepted 'subject to indefinite delay.'
The company cannot accept perishable
or livestock shipments' destined to Port-
li.nd Ore., or El Paso or points west.
thereof, which cannot be reached by
regular freight train schedules by 7
a., m., Saturday, September 3, effec
tive immediately."
With the grnpe harvest just starting
and the cattle .raising sections just
rounding up stock for market shipments.
the order comes as a serious blow to
California farmers. It is expected to
cause trouble in supplying this -city's
needs until water transportation is in
augurated sufficiently to handle the
needed commodities.
As a result of their strike prepara
tions, neither the Southern Pacific nor
the Santa Fe expects to cease passenger
tram service if the strike is called Mon
day. Southern Pacific officials declare
former employes and those in the serv
ice long enough to warrant a pension in
a short time have been fully organ
ised for the impending crisis.
It is not known what preparations
have been made by the Western Pa
cific to meet a strike. ' ,

Seattle, Wash., Aug. 30. Transcon
tinental railroad companies running out
of Seattle, including the Great North
ern, Northorn Pacific, Chicago, Mil
waukee and St. Paul and Burlington to
dny discontinued accepting perishable;
freight and livestock shipments, that
would not reach their destination be
fore September 2, because of the im
pending strike.
No restrictions on passenger traffic,
however, had been issued. Through
tickets are being sold, and no local
officials were able to predict what
move would be made to handle the
public in caso of the strike being call
ed Monday.
All short haul shipments of perish
iiblo freight were being accepted, and
it was predicted, will continue to he
taken, even though the strike is call
ed " There is no doubt but that all
railroads will make a desperate effort
to keep things moving," said a high
Great Northern official this morning.
Most of the freight refusals, it was
announced, are being made east of the
Cascade mountains and apply to long
hauls across the continent.
