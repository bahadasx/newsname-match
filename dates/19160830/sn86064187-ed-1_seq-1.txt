MAYOR DEFENDS
RENTAL OF FAIR
SITE FOR PARK
Enabling. Act to Permit New
Grandstand, He Says,
.Mayor Uv.'rholser tins morning
warmly defended the rity commission
ers'offer to lease thr State Fair grounds
for a city park for two years.
"Hy doing this," declared the mayor,
"we have enabled the State Fair asso
ciation to go at once to work on the
construction of its $40000 cement edi
fice to replace the grandstand destroyed
by fire. They would nut have bren
able otherwise to do so.
"There is going to be an attend
ance of 50,000 on the opening day of
the fair. It is infinitely for the the wel
fars of the city's business that this
vast assemblage of people find a per
manent building erected almost over
nkjfct, and the fair ground In better
shape than before the fire. Tm (merer
sion has gone out oyer the state that'
practically the entire state fair build
ings have been burned to the ground.'
Attacki Lyoa'a Statement
The mayor bitterly attacked a state
ment made yesterday by Secretary of
State Lyon in which Mr. Lyon gave
the impression that the city commis
sioners had blundered into offering
SJUi.OOU for $.,,000 worth of. property.,!
.Mr. i.yons attitude is ridiculous.
uivuivuii
said the mayor. "He would figure it
out that we are trying to squander
$1M,0D0 of the city's money. In his
weird calculation, h" omitted the fact
that there ar: buildings valued at near
ly $.100000 standing on the $Jo,000
piece of property. This would makefa
total valuation of lUo.000, for which
he said we offfred $J00000. Not suh a
bad business investment.
Not Buying Outright.
"However, it has not been the de
cision of the commissioners to buy the
roperty outright, and I do not even
:now that they are, any of them, con
sidering it at all."
Under the method of renting nro-
posed by the city, the State Fair
rounds would become the biggest and
est equipped park in the city for all
recreation purposes, especially In the
way of playgrounds and athletic events.
wlat IavestmsBt.
While at the worst our proposition
could but be called an effort to h;lp
out the State Fair association in a
time of vital need," Mayor Ovcrholser
concluded, "I am of opinion that it
is the best and most foresighted busi
ness investment the city could make
at this time."
