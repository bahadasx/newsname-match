Once a year a co-operative meet
ing of the Baptist missionary society
and the W. C. T. IT. is held and to
it all interested are invited. The re
cent meeting was held last Monday
afternoon in the Baptist church and
there were present r?presentatives
from all the missionary societies in
town. Mrs. T. R.Denny as presi
dent of the W. C. T. U., who will
soon go to make her home elsewhere
was asked to conduct the meeting,
and she arranged a most interesting
program. After piano selections by
Miss Antoinette Denny, the script
ure lesson was read, followed by
prayer by Mrs. L. C. Latimer,presi
dent of Baptist missionary society.
Mrs. M. T. Turner who is super
intendent of co-operative work of
W. M. S., and W. C. T. U. gave
some interesting thoughts of good
derived by these meetings. Mrs. E.
O. Eidson of the Methodist church
read a tract, "What co-operative
?work has done." vocal duet, "A
song of victory" Miss Laurie Hoyt,
Master Thomas Hhyt. A recitation

enjoyed. Mrs. E. R. Mobley read a
striking poem, "Did you?" Leaflet,
"Plans for preparedness,"Mrs. W.
J. Hatcher. The constitution for
national prohibition was read and
adopted. A delightful feature was
the music by Mrs. L. A. Cooper
and Miss Margaret Cooper on
piano and violin. Mrs. A. P. Lott
made an effective talk on "The
friend of the poor and needy," and
told many interesting facts that en
listed the sympathy of her hearers,
among which was of the Sunday
school for the colored people which
she organized on their farm. The
meeting closed with a few remarks
>^?rom the president, Mrs. Latimer,
" and was dismissed with a feeling
prayer by Mrs. J. L. Smith of the

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Refreshing Rains. Cotton Open
ing Rapidly. Very Suc
cessful Meeting at
Hardy's.
Oh! what a glorious rain wo had
Sunday afternoon. Two splendid
showers after two o'clock so we
hope the pollen was set in the cot
ton blooms. Cotton is being carried
into Augusta like it was the middle
of September. We noticed about
20 wagons standing around Mr.
N?rnberger'* oin waiting to be
ginned Saturday afternoon as we
went into town and equally as many
as we came on home. What little
there is will soon be out and in the
factor's/hands, then after the farm
er has sold all he has the price will
shoot up higher than for many
years we suspect. The crop has
been injured very much from this
dry spell and it has lost terribly.
We hope to have more rain and
cloudy days to help revive the cot
ton, corn, peas and potatoes.
The protracted meeting at Har
dy's was very well attended each
day and splendid sermons by Mr.
Sexton in the morning and by Mr.
Cowien in the afternoon. Ile is a
converted Jew from Charleston.
Expects to go to Louisville, Ky., to
study for the ministry in a few
weeks. He is a fine speaker. I wrote
his name as I understood it last
week as Howard, but he spelled it
for me, Cowien. There were three
additions to the church and we
hope others may come prepared for
the water and join next third Sun
day.
We would love to have been at
Mt. Zion Sunday to the dedication
of the new church. Would be so
glad if we could go to Gilgal too.
Hope our society may be well rep
resented there.
