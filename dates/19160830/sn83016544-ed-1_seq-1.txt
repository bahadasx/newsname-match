GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN* AUGUST 30, 1916.
AUTOMOBILE CLUB
WILL HOLD PICNIO
The Second Annual Outing of tho
Two Harbors Auto Club to
be Held on Labor Day
at Beaver Bay.
The second annual outing of the
Two Harbors Automobile Club will
be held at Beaver Bay on Labor Day,
Monday, September 4th, 1916, ac­
cording to arrangements made by the
committee on Exhibitions, Contests
and Tours, consisting of Glen S.Lock
er, E. A. Daniels, George Munford,
H. C. Hamilton and Emil Nelson.
Notices are being sent to all mem­
bers of the club to meet on Third
avenue, east of the Lake County
Court House, from which point the
start will be made at 10 o'clock in the
forenoon. It is not the intention to
make any record time between Two
Harbors and Beaver Bay, but to
maintain a reasonable rate of speed
during the entire distance so as to
enable all to keep up with the pace
and be able to appreciate the splend
road and get a good view of the
magnificent scenery.
All automobilists, whether mem­
bers of the club or not, are cordially
invited to take part in the outing.
It is the intention to have an old
time picnic. All car owners are to
select their own passengers, and
bring their own picnic dinner. Every­
thing will be entirely informal, ex­
cept that is is the desire of the
committee and officers of the club
that all be on hand at the designated
place so that the start can be made
promptly at ten o'clock, and the cars
should keep as close together as saf­
ety and road conditions will warrant.
It is hoped that a parade of 100
automobiles will wind down the hill
into the historic village some time
between 11:30 and 12 noon. Picnic
dinner at 1 o'clock p. m.
The road to Beaver Bay is now the
best it has ever been, surpassing by
far the road to Duluth. The scenery
especially as Beaver Bay is approach­
ed, is not rivaled anywhere in this
section of the state. Beaver Bay is
an ideal place for an outing. The
falls of the Beaver River, where the
waters running over the solid rocks
for countless ages have ivorn a deep
groove, is an inspiring sight, especi­
ally during wet weather when there
is a high stage of water.
Just below the falls is the "old
swimmin' hole" which furnished
healthy and wholesome sport for the
entire Americans long before the ad­
vent of the white man on the north
shore of Lake Superior, and which is
now constantly enjoyed by the resi­
dents of the little village and by the
many tourists who visit this beauti­
ful spot in ever increasing numbers
since the road has been made the best
best in Northern Minnesota. All who
have bathing suits should take them.
If weather conditions are favorable
a good time is in store for all who
enjoy this sport. One does not need
to be an expert swimmer in order to
be able to enjoy the water sports at
Beaver Bay. Get in the swim, watch
the enthusiastic go over the falls in
the deep gorge over the smoothly
worn rocks. No danger at all, but
the most thrilling sight imaginable
Beaver Bay was the first settle
met on the north of Lake Superior
It was the county seat of Lake Coun­
ty from the time the county was
organized in 1856 to 1888 when Two
Harbors, became the county seat.
There is still evidence of the saw mill
industry that flourished there long
before Two Harbors was settled, not
ably the remains of a high timber
trestle that crossed the river a short
distance below the falls, much of
which is still quite well preserved.
There is also still practically intact
the old dock built by the Wielands
out of slabs and timber on the west
side of Beaver Bay, near its mouth
And best of all there are some of
the best people on earth living in
this quiet little spot, many of whom
are well known to a large number of
our pioneer citizens. Go up and get
acquainted with these hospitable peo­
ple who have lived close to and com­
muned with nature while others have
rushed to the centers of population
and joined in the mad rush for socie
ty and the "almighty dollar". There
are the Slaters, Hangartners, Betz
lers, Capt. McLauchlin, and many
other pleasant and hospitable people
who can tell inumerable interesting
stories of the early days of the north
shore of Lake Superior.
We but voice the unanimous opin­
ion of all who have visited the natur­
al beauty sppt when we say it is the
most beautiful place on the north
shore of Lake Superior of which we
have any knowledge. It the hope
of the Two Harbors Automobile Club
officers that there will be at least 600
of our citizens join and take part in
this second annual tour picnic.—
Two Harbors Journal-Ntws.

COMMENT ON COOK
COUNTY JAIL BREAKING
Building of Sheriff's Residence in
Connection with Jail That
Closer Watch May be
Kept Over Inmates.
The escape of Harry Davis from
the county jail has been the subject.
of much comment the past two
weeks. When arrested there was
very little evidence at hand against
him, but later events have proven
beyond any doubt that he was the
man wanted, and that he was a high
class safe-blower as well as a high
class jail-breaker.
It would be unjust for any sheriff
to confine a man, arrested on sus-,
picion, in a cell day and night, and
we do not believe that there is a!
sheriff in the state who would so
confine, a" man against whom there
was so little evidence at hand. The
building of a residence for the sher­
iff in conne6tion with the jail would
be a great safeguard for the county
prisoners, and the day is not far dis­
tant when it will have to be done.
At present, if a prisoner were
taken ill in the night he could get
no attention until morning when
breakfast would be brought him, and
in some cases might result fatally.
We believe that the time has
come for the County Board to take
action on this, thus insuring safety
for the county in keeping its pris­
oners, and in the event of sickness
of an inmate of the jail.
TO SHOW MINNESOTA PRO­
DUCTS IN OTHER STATES
The Minnesota Board of Immigra­
tion is preparing to invade the
states of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana
with an agricultural exhibit at their
State and District Fairs this fall.
The itinerary has been perfected,
and attaches of the Department are
assembling the exhibit which will
consist of the choicest clover, timo­
thy and alfalfa, wild grasses etc., to
be found anywhere in the State. In
addition to this will be sheaves of
grain, rye, wheat, oats and barley,
ivt&fji'' threshed grains and seeds of
all kinds, will be shown as well as all
kinds of fruits, potatoes and other
vegetables.
This exhibit will be displayed in a
large tent at the various fairs and
it ia the intention of the Depart­
ment to have one of the most com­
plete agricultural exhibits ever
shown by the State at foreign fairs.
The following itinerary has been pre­
pared by Fred D. Sherman, Commis­
sioner of Immigration.
Laporte, Indiana, District Fair,
August 29th to September 1st In­
dianapolis, Indiana, State Fair, Sep­
tember 4th to September 8th South
Bend, Indiana, District Fair, Septem­
ber 12th to 14th Springfield, 111.,
State* Fair, September 15th to 23rd
Peoria, Jllinois, District Fair, Sep­
tember 26th to October 7th Water­
loo, Iowa, Dairy Catle Congress, Oc­
tober 9th to 15th. The above is the
itinerary thus far decided upon, but
other fairs will be attended if pos­
sible.
"I have been looking up the figures
of attendance of these fairs in the
past years," said Fred D. Sherman,
Commission of Immigration, and I
estimate that this year the combined
attendance at these fairs will be
about 800,000 people.
It is estimated by State Fair au­
thorities that about 70 per cent of
the visitors at fairs see all principal
exhibits that being the case, Minne­
sota's exhibits should be viewed by
over 500,000 people during the trip.
Of course we can not expect to per­
sonally meet but a small percentage
of these visitors, but many maps and
booklets telling about our State will
be destributed among them."
A. C. WEISS MAKES VISIT
TO GRAND MARAIS
Mr. and Mrs. A. C. Weiss and dau
hgter, Miss Mary Weiss, of Duluth,
motored to Grand Marais yesterday
afternoon, returning to Duluth this
morning. This is Mr. Weiss' first
visit to this village since 1894, and he
expressed himself as much pleased at
the good roads and general improve­
ments in conditions in the County.
He has been the active manager of
the Duluth Herald for over twenty
five years. He promises to make
Grand Marais another visit in the
near future, when he will spend more
time in the village and county.

for it before the rest of the line
work commences in the spring.
LAKE SHORE TELEPHONE CO.
FIRES ON SUPERIOR
NATIONAL FOREST.
Fire conditions in the Superior
National Forest still remain very un­
favorable. Five fires have been com­
pletely put out, and one is under
control, and being patrolled. Three
other fires are being fought with a
crew of seventy-five men.
One fire has burned over ap­
proximately four thousand acres and
may cover a considerably larger
area before it is under control. It
has been necessary to take in men
and supplies as well as tools and
lamp equipment, by canoe.
Forestry officials are very much
gratified that through co-operation
with County and City officials and
the St. Croix Lumber and Mfg. Co.
they have been able to secure men
to put on the fire line. It is ex­
pected that it will take about ten
days to control the fires now burn­
ing.

NEW TOWN ROAD FROM
SHORE ROAD TO LUTSEN
A new road has been constructed
by the town of Lutsen from the
County road down to the hotel and
post office at Lutsen, and the old
road, which was constructed along
the steep bank of the Poplar river,
has been abandoned. The new road
is very wide and a uniform grade
throughout makes it an easy climb
for teams and autos. It leaves the
County road about where the old
road ran and goes westerly, just
south of the school house, and makes
a turn to the east just west of the
cottage occupied by Forest Ranger
Mulligan, and continues to the post
office and general store along the
shore line south of the hotel. It has
been widened out at its terminus to
about 100 feet and an attractive iron
fence has been erected along the lake
shore for safety. Altogether it is a
great improvement, both for beauti­
fying and practical standpoint, the
old road being steep and dangerous.
Misses Inga Jackson and Velna Mon­
ker left for Duluth on Monday night
where they will attend the Duluth
Business Uuiversity.
Five Dollars in Gold
Given Away
At a special election held last
week in the town of Maple Hill, it

of $5,000 for road and bridge purpo­
ses. The vote was unanimous in
favor of the bond issue. The survey­
ing of a route for the new Gunflint
road is now being done, the probable
location of it being some distance
east of the present road.
For the purpose of encouraging
the advisability of saving when
young, we have decided to give
FIVE DOLLARS IN GOLD to
any boy or girl under the age of
sixteen years, who deposits with
this bank in its Savings Depart­
ment the greatest amount of
cash actually earned, from the
1st day of September 1916, up to
and including the fifteenth day
of the same month.
Call at the bank for furtner particu­
lars.
