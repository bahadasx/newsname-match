Cheers for Manning. Chief Executive
of State Given Fine Reception by
Crowd at Cheater.
Cheater, Aug. 2 f..?Cole L, Blease,
confronted by a jubilant Manning
sentlmenr., today bolted the scheduled
campaign meeting here, charging that
his "friends were crowded out," and
announcing that ho would apeak at]
3 o'clock In the afternoon at the court
house. Prior, to the speeches by gu?
bernatorial candidates the question of
tranaferiiig the meeting from the
opera house to the court house square
\ as debated. This plan was abandon?
ed when James H. Glenn,., county
chairman, announced that there were j
only a bo Jt 50 people on the other side
who couUl easily wedge Into the alley-1
ways between the walls and the outer
rows of iioats. These pressed forward i
to occupy available space and listened |
attentively to John T. t)uncnn and
Gov, Manning, the first speakers In
the gubernatorial race. j
With the announcement by Mr. j
Blease that he Would nc4 speak a
large proportion of the audience de- j
parted, possibly as many as one-half
leaving, and M?. Cooper and Mr. Dos- j
Champs spoke to a much reduced
house. The meting was attended by
six or seven hundred people, many of
these being women, who responded
as spiritedly as the men when a tell ?
In thrust had been made by rival
candidates.
j Gov. Manning was most .cordially
I received and at the conclusion of his
speech received two large bunches of
flowers. Encouraged by the cordial re?
ception he spoke with earnestness and
enthusiasm, discussing the problems
of law enforcement and the general
demoralised conditions which con
i fronted him when ho was inducted
into office. He referred with feeling
to the tight which is being made by
cotton mill pesldents to bring about
hin defeat. The acts, he said, which

Ho had no apology to make and would
net alter his course should the oppor?
tunity again present itself. He also
hi thiy commended the warehouse sys?
tem.
Mr. Cooper Spoke at a distinct dis?
advantage because of tho disrupted
mooting. Ho had entered the race
without pledge or promise to any man
or set of men and if elected was bound
by no promise to any one. Should
some of the votern make the mistake
of voting against him he would re?
gard It only as had judgement and
would attempt to forget just how the
people voted If he were made gover?
nor and If called upon to act in behalf
of or against anyone. He also dis?
cussed thoroughly a plan to raise the
standard of the public school system.

CLOSES WITH MEETING AT
WINNSBORO.
Governor Gives High Tribute to Hood
?-Bleose Makes Bitterest of
Speeches.
Winnsboro, Aug. 26.?The State
campaign, begun in Spartanburg more
than two months ago, was brought to
a conclusion in Winnsboro today with
ja crescendo I effect, Cole L. Blease
! making the bitterest speech of the en?
tire tour. The meeting was held with
! in sight of the bullet scarred stairs on
(which Sheriff Adam Dubard Hood,
i Raleigh Boulware, Clyde Isenhower
and Jules Smith, a negro prisoner,
were .shot to death, June 14, 1915,
when the negro was being brought to
trial, from criminal assault upon a
j white woman, and it was about this
fatal tragedy that the ex-governor
wove his arguments on the alleged
lawlessness which he says is so rara
j pant over the State. Language em
i ployed by the speaker was so offen
jsive that many of the women in the
I audience retired beyond earshort. A
letter said to have been written by
'sheriff Hood was read in which it was
; explained that the negro would have
! to be protected at all hazards and
I delivered to the court; otherwise,
(Gov. Manning would withdraw * the
officer's commission. It was on the
! basis of this letter that Mr. Blease
[laid the crime to Mr. Manning, hold
I ing that if Rlease had been governor,
ithe crime could have been avenged
! outside the court, and the lives of the
officials, who had sworn to uphold the
law, would have been saved.
J Gov. Manning paid the dead sheriff
a beautiful tri^ite in his speech, and
later in the day placed on the dead
man's grave the flowers he received
in Chester yesterday. In speaking of
the tragedy, Mr. Manning said:
"In your own county of Fairfield.
within a /ew feet of the place I now
i ' !
t stand, the first clash came, and your
j sheriff, the brave Adam Hood, gave
jup his life in the discharge of his
jduty. His example is one that we
j shall treasure as a proud example of
^?u?sHrnaira^ Letrue 'hold
ihis memory dear and his example one
I that we shall treasure always, if we
'are true to our ideals and traditions."
j In speaking of his efforts to enforce
the laws of the State, Mr. Manning
'continued:
"The paramount issue of this cam
! paign, I reiterate, is whether we are
!to have enforcement of our laws or
whether the decrees of our courts
and the verdicts of our Juries are to
. be set aside by the arbitrary will of
' one man. Our laws can not be en?
forced without intensifying the feel
I ings of those opposed to them.v The
! conditions that existed when I came
into office wer<3 marked by lawless
i deeds and violations of law. I prom?
ised to enforce the law by every power
i given mc under the constitution and
laws of the State. I called upon
I sheriffs and other peace officers to
'enforce the laws without partiality,
i
but with firmness and vigor. I know
. well what that meant and so did the
officers."
Gov. Manning was the first cf the
candidates for governor to speak to?
day and left immediately for Colum
iba. Mr. Blee.se, later speaking to the
audience, said that Gov: Manning
"hasn't mentioned my name or. this
campaign nor resented anything the
ex-governor had said." Mr. Bleas-o dc
jnounced the governor as a liar and a
coward, something which has not been
'ventured previously on the campaign
and was not tried today until Gov.
Manning had departed.
I R. A. Cooper told the people they
I had heard much of lawlessness. Dis?
regard for law, he argued, was a dis?
ease, the antidote for which was edu?
cation. The speaker outlined a plan
to raise the standard of the common
schools which would carry all pupils
through the second college year. He
also advocated the opening of all State
institutions to every ambitious boy and
girl, these to be educated at the ex?
pense of the State, and the funds to
i be returned by the young men and
women when they are out of college,
i John Madison DesChanips said he
was a prohibitionist, and believed if
jSt. Paul were living now he would
I re\ ise his advice "to take a little wine
'for the stomach's sake" and would
Urge the use of water instead. Mr.
IDesChamps also advocated woman
suffrage. "The refusal to grant equal
suffrage is a relic of barbarism," he
said.

PEARY / ? THINKS THAT HE
/VERED IT.
Say* 'ay Not be Exactly Where He
Reported, but is Probably in That
Neighborhood.
New York, Aug. 20.?Rear Ad?
miral Robert E. Peary reiterates his
confidence in the existence of Crocker
land and his belief that he saw it in
July, 1906. The admiral's state?
ment, telegraphed to The Tribune
from his summer place in Maine,
I was called forth by the fact that En?
sign Fitzhugh Green, the naval offl
|cer assigned to the MacMillan Crocker
! land Arctic expedition, made r o re
| port of whether the expedition found
Crocker land in announcing to the
naval department his safe arrival et
Copenhagen on August 19.
After quoting from his original
narrative of the expedition his story
of the first view of what he believed
to be Crocker land, Admiral Peary
j said:
"It may be that MacMillan and I
were both misled by the nearly per?
manent clouds of condensation over
persistent lanes of water. Or unusu?
al refraction which occurs iri the
Arctic regions may have lifted into
view land that was in reality well
below the horizon and my estimate of
the distance of Crocker land may
have been too moderate. It witl be
well to await the completion of Ste
fan3Son's discoveries before dismiss?
ing Crocker land."
