DALLAS. Texas, Aug. 29. General
offices of the Missouri, Kansas
Texas railroad here announced an em
bargo on all perishable freight, ef
fective tomorrow morning; the order
also states no livo stock will be ac
cepted for shipment unless it reaches

OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 29. Em
bargo against further shipments of
freight over the Southern railway will
become effective in 24 hours If de
velopments today In Washington are
t nfavorable relutlvo to the Impend
ing railroad strike. This Information
was telegraphed here today to W. T.
Keating, local agent of the Southern.
The telegram was sent by L. Green,
general freight traffic manager of the
road. It was requested In the mes
sage to send this information to nil
sl ippers of the line In this territory.
In several places In Oklahoma
agents of tho railroads have arranged
with sheriffs" forces for officers to
guard the railroad property. It Is un

railroads have already advertised for
trainmen to handle the trains In event
tho strike Is actually put In force.

similar action is being considered by
the other roads entering the city.

tho New York Central, said tonight
that A. H. Smith, the president, was
expected from Washington tomorrow
and that the nuestlon of an embargo
probably would be gone Into.

officials discussed the subject, hut, ac
cording to P. J. Flynn, vice-president,
reached no definite decision.
The Pennsylvania and other roads
here, it was said, also are undecided
as yet.
Inquiry today among railroad di
rectors and important financial In
terests affiliated with railroads indi
cated no change of attitude in re
spect to the railroad strike situation.
Although the negotiations at Washing
ton have been in charge of the rail
road presidents, It Is well understood
here that the ultimate decisions in
the dealings with the employes and
the president have with few excep
tions rested In the hands of the execu
tive committees of the various boards
of directors, many of whom are the
most Important financiers of the
country.
These men for the most part, one
of them said today, are for Insistence
to the end upon the principle of arbi
tration and will not back down, come
what may. It also was asserted that
when the railroad executives de

During the meeting, Mayor Sim

Lnttle which lasted three hours In

o'clock last night without anything

will be resumed this morning at 9

Attorney E. J. Glddlngs of Okla
homa City, representing the union
men, contended that the city ordin
ance covering disturbing the peace Is
not valid for the reason that it con
flicts with the slate law und further
that the pickets should be released
because they had not violated either
the ordinance or the state law.
Assistant City Attorney John It.

that the process by which the writ
was served on the men by the dls

for Judge Ramsey to hear the case
and further that the county court has
no jurisdiction at this time.
It is the contention of the city that
tho proper procedure Is for the de

accept a trial by Jury ut tho next term

STRIKE AT HAND
Wilson Asks for Legisla
tion With Whi.h to
Appease Both Sides
"GOD HELP YOU," HE
TELLS BROTHERHOODS
Relations Between Two
Factions Are Severed
and Crisis Xears
WASHINGTON. Aug. 21). Presi
dent Wilson laying the railway
strike situation before congress today
with recommendations for legislation
udvuuccd the crisis to u stage where
tho next developments depend upon
two points. They ure:
Whether the legislation he pro
poses call he passed.
If enacted, will it be effective to
prevent a strike already called for 7
a. in., Sept'inbcr 4?
Neither of these questions call be
answered tonight.
The brotherhood heads thcmselws,
annum. ring- tbelr Intention to fight
certain portions of the president's
program, are at loggerheads over
whether Its enactment would prevent
the strike.
Tho railway presidents favorable to
President Wilson's plan In the main
think It would make It difficult for
the strike to begin.
Meanwhile although negotiations
between the employers and men were
luoken off today hv the rejection of
the railway presidents' latest proposal
for arbitration, President Wilson is
continuing his efforts to bring the two
Hides together on some form of agree
men t.
Everybody Works,
Efforts which might well be de
scribed us almost superhuman are
being exerted to that end tc nlirlit.
When the brotherhood lenders this
mrrnlng relected the latest proposal
to the railroads und definitely set the
strike for Uilicr day without further
notice. President Wilson decided to
lay the whole situation before con
gress Before a Joint session of house and
senate and with a solemn recital of
the distress a disastrous strike would
bring to tho country, the president
proposed a plan of legislation. This
Is the proposal In his own language:
First. Immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative re
organization of the Interstate com
merco commission along the lines em
bodied in the bill recently passed by
the house of representatives und now
awaiting action by the senate In or
der that the commission may he
enabled to deal with the many great
and various duties now devolving
upon it with a promptness and n
thoroughness which ure Willi Its
present constitution and means of ac
tion, practically impossible.
Second, tho establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employes who are
actually engaged In the work of oper
ating trams in interstate transporta
tion. Third, the authorization of the ap
point merit by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual
results In experience of the adoption
of the eight-hour day In railway
transportation, alike for the men and
the railwuys; its effect ;n the matter
of operating costs, the application or
the existing practices and agreements
to tho new conditions, und in all other
practical uspects with the provision
that the investigators shall report
their conclusions to congress at the
earliest possible date, but without
recommendation as to legislative ac
tion; in order that the public may
learn from un unprejudiced source
Just what actual ilevelopuints have
ensued.
Must Have Increase.
Fourth, explicit upproval by the
congress of the consideration by the
Interstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered
necessary by the adoption of the eight
hour Huv arid which have not been
offset by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify tho Increase.
Fifth, un amendment of the existing I
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation und arbitration j
of such controverties as the present, I
by adding to It u provision that In!
case the methods of accommodation
now provided for should fall, a full '
public Investigation of the merits of j
every such dispute shall be Instituted;
and completed before a strike or lock
out may lawfully be attempted.
Sixth, tho lodgment In tho hands of!
the executive of the power in case or
military necessity to take control of
such portions and such rolling stock
of the railways of the country as may
bo required for military use mid to
operate them for military purposes
with authority to draft into the mili
tary service of the I'nited States such
train crews and administrative offi
cials as the circumstances require for
tlielr; safe and efficient use.
Immediately after the president had
delivered his recommendations, con
gress set about to see how they might
be enacted into law. The senate in
terstate commerce committee which
has before It bills prepared to carry
out the plan, did not get a quorum
and will meet tomorrow morning. The
house leaders announced their Inten
tion of wulting on the senate's action.
The president Intends to use all his
Influence to hasten action In con
gress, but should there bo delay, he
Intends to appeal to the patriotism of
the leaders and their duty to the pub
lic not to persist In calling the strike
at this tlma.

Tfl-SA today will feel the first
clutch of the threatened nation
wide railroad strike as a result of
jiener. l embargos on all perishable;
fic'ght posted yesterday by the S mta.
l-'e and Missouri. Kansas & Tex i
railroads. Merchants fear that tha
I'risco und Midland Valley will follov
with a similar action today, thus
citiing off I he vital flow of meals,
butter, eegs, fruits, vegetables and
ether commodities wlil-h supply tho
su.-lenalice of the city
Shippers and merchants are at a
loss to draw any conclusion as to
the probable status e-r the food situa
tion and are merely helplessly-awaiting
further a"lion by the rouds or
the men. While some of the Im
porting firms assumed a most pessl
ml.vtlc allitudu when they learned of
I be embargoes yesterday, others
evinced Hie opinion that nothing of a
scrloitr nature wciild result.
The Santa Fe railroad was the flr.H
on- I,, rcai h the local field with an
order yesterday. The bulletin which
wis received bv I'. T. McKlrahnn,
commercial agent with offices hero,
instructed lis agents to accept ni
perishable freight and to ai cept all
et'iei freight only on conditions of
Iml 'f'iilte delay The order Lemma
i f fectlve lie mediately.
Send Out Older.
The order was as follows
"Kf fectlve at once (filed 3: It
o'clock) and until further notice, do
not accept any shipments of live
stock e.r perishable property. All
other freight subject to Indefinite de
lay." (Slrncd) J. It. Koontz, generul
f.-c Igbt agent.
The Kuty made known Its embargo
from head-iuarlers yesterday after
noon, but iii to u lato hour lust
night F. W. Dunn, local agent, had
not received the official notice. It is
probable that It will be relayed to
day. officials of the Frisco and Midi-end
Valley said last night that they
had ii" bleu of the possibility of their
rends following the lead of the Mint
Fe and Katy. Their first Information
would be the orders themselves.
Kvcn if it does come," said W. A.
.Moore, local general agent, lust night,
"It will be merely a precautionary
measure and should not be construed
In any other light."
There is some opinion that the
Midland Valley will not bo so ra'1ily
efle-ited by tlm strike and In light of
this immunity will not consider an
embargo.
Several loading ruilrouds In the east
have issued orders similar to that ro.
eclvod here yesterday by the Santa Fe.
Tbii Immediate result of tho em
bargo, should It extend to all roads
coining Into Tulsa, will bo the cutting
off of the heavy importation of food
stuffs. I'roduce managers and beads rf the
two leading parking companies said
last nllit that there are enough sup
ldles of the purely perishable com
modities stored III the cily to supply
the demand for u week or more. This
will no! hold good if there is any rush
for goods by excited housewives.
Mi ut for a Wce-k.
II. M. McKay, manager of the local
branch or Armour & Co., estimuted
last nlKht that there are at present
about .'li.neo pounds of meats of all
kinds stored In the city. This amount,
under normal conditions, would lust
a week In Tulsa. Armour ,4 Co. de
pends entirely upon meats shippod
from outside plants.
The Independent I'm king company,
a local concern, Is the only other
house in the cily with the exception
of retailers. The Independent com
pany supplle-s its trade from meat
killed ami dressed here, but It Is un
derstood that Its output is limited to
a certain extent.
Although the trade Is so scattered
that no estimates can lie obtained. It
Is understood that a heavy percentage
of the eggs and butter consumed here
is shipped in from larger cities and
that in - use of an embargo by all the
roads the. 'oeal supply would not eeiual
the dcma.ul. These commodities,
however, could he shipped by express
until the strike Is called.
The milk supply Is largely locul and
Is only slightly affected by the strike.
It is po-sible that souk- of the sur
rounding cities may suffer.
Creud which goes to the tables of
Tulsans Is baked in Tulsa ovens. Flour
can be secured from local flour nulls.
thus insuring one vital commodity in
an emergency.
K It. Cokcr. head or tho Ilcu-Iteed
Milling company, said last night that
his company was fully prepared to
meet a'l demands.
"We have amassed a good reserve-
supply of flour In anticipation of Just
st rb a status of allans. said .Mr.
t'oker last night. "We can easily euro
for tb- wants of Tulsa."
Fruits and vegetables will be absent
from the the menu of Tulsa after a
few days if the embargo is made
general.
There are about three car loads of
apples In the city, according to esti
mates made by produce men yester
day. This amount would suffice for
more than a wiek. Other fruits would
not last a wet after the supply is cut
off. Watermelons are the exception
since they are supplied locally.
All vegetables are liable to b
memories after a week and Irish po
tatoes may not last this long.
