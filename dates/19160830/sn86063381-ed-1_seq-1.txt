Rates.
UNION PACIFIC MEN ARE
RESTRAINED FROM STRIKE
Embargo Placed on Goods Which
Cannot Be Delivered on
Saturday.
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug 30.No powei
under heaven except the railroads ac
cepting the brotherhood men's propo
sition can prevent the big rail strike,
according to Strike Leader Lee to
day.
President Wilson made an attempt
to get the brotherhoods to see that
if they strike Monday with congress
considering favorable legislation that
they.would get public condemnation.
The brotherhoods were unmoved by
his attempt and insist upon a strike.
"God Forgive You."
"God forgive you, I cannot," Wil
son told the rail executives last night
after they had formally rejected his
proposition.
Congressional efforts for strike
legislation are deadlocked. Senators
are charging that each other is at
tempting to make political capital
from the strike.
It is believed that congress will
not act immediately upon the presi
dent's suggestion tor an increase in
the membership of the interstate
commerce commission and the auth
orization for the increase of freight
rates. All parties seem to have
agreed that these amendments will
not be adopted urHl later
Suspend Increases.
The interstate commerce commis
sion today suspended the proposed
increases in transcontinental freight
rates.
The senate interstate commerce
committee today announced that a
formal hearing of brotherhood men,
rail managers and shippers would be
held at nine o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. Suggestions will be heard in
regard to the proposed legislation
Twenty-eight companies of coast
artillery recently to sent to the Mex
ican border were ordered to return to
their coast defense batteries.
Strikers Have Money.
Fifteen millions of dollars bulge in
the war chest of the railway brother
hoods.
This amount, about equally divided
among the four unions, is ready to
day for distribution among the men
i should they need strike relief. It is
to be doled out in portions of $40 a
month among the 400,000 men who
would be involved in a national rail
way tieup How long it would last
is problemetical, for relief might
start with the opening of the strike
or might be delayed until later.
As the brotherhood men view it,
their mighty war chest would prob
ably not be touched in the forthcom
ing strike, for they believe it will
be so brief that the men will not feel
the pinch of unemployment
Weekly Assessments.
The great war fund has been gath
erad through weekly contributions,
covering a long space of time. The
assessment varied, according to the
member's earnings, but the total sum
per year is written in fixed thou
sands.
One little code written from Wash
ington to every railway center in the
country is sufficient to precipitate the
threatened strike The more than
600 brotherhood delegates who left
for their posts yesterday, carried with
them instructions for running a
strike. Trains on the line? will be
run to the nearest junctions, fires will
be banked and engines oiled. The
engines and the cars will be deliv
ered to the companies in perfect con
dition and every union man will then
quit the property with orders to avoid
violence or trespassing.
Only 24 of the biggest brotherhood
men remain here today. According
to their version, they must stand pat
on the eight-^our day, with 10 hours
pay.

BROTHERHOODS STAND FIRM NATION READY FOR BIG STRIKE
ROOT PLEADS FOR
WEEDING OUT OF
INCOMPETENT MEN
President of American Bar Associa
tion, in Annual Address, Wants
Changes.
SATS MANY ATTORNEYS
ARE VERT UNNECESSARY
Urges Lawyers of Country to Forget
Selfishness and Aid the
Country.
(By United Press)
Chicago, Aug. 30.President Elihu
Root of the American Bar association
pleaded for a weeding out of the un
necessary and incompetent among the
114,000 lawyers in the United States
in his annual address at the open
ing of the meeting of that organiza
tion here today.
"It is true of the American people
generally," Bald Mr. Root, "that too
many of us having been trying to get
something out of the country and
too few of us have been trying to
serve it."
Forget Selfishness.
Basing his plea for efficiency in the
administration of the law upon the
statement that we must get down to
brass tacks in all our affairs if we're
going to keep pace with Europe after
the war, Mr.. Root flayed our "cum
bersome machinery of justice" and
called upon the lawyers to forget
their selfishness and give the country
little service not only in law admin
istration, but in law making. He
said that as a rule only the youngest
and least experienced lawyers get
into our lawmaking bodies, local,
state and national. Concerning the
law and the lawyers, Mr. Root said:
"There is great economic waste in
the administration of the law in state
and nation. We spend vast sums
building court houses, paying judges,
clerks and others and the product in
^hstice^ fs disproportionate to the
plant and working force. There is
no country in the world where the
doing of justice is burdened by such
heavy overhead charges. It all
causes an enormous waste of time on
the part of witnesses, jury panel and
parties.
Bar is Crowded.
"The ease with which admission
to the bar is secured in many juris
dictions and the attraction of a car
eer which affords a living without
manual labor has crowded the bar
with more lawyers than are neces
sary. Of the 114,000 lawyers in the
United States a very considerable
part are not needed. If that busi
ness was conducted like the business
of any great industrial or transpor
tation company which is striving for
the highest efficiency at the least cost
in order to compete successfully with
its rivals, a very considerable per
centage of the 114,000 would be dis
charged.
"Why do these defects exist in our
administration of justice? The Am
erican people are not quarrelsome or
litigious. They are good natured,
practical, simple and direct their
methods, respectors of law and hon
est in their dealings. Our bar as a
whole is courageous, loyal and able.
I think the underlying cause is that
unconsciously we treat the business
of administering justice as something
to be done for private benefi| instead
of for public service."
Should Redraft Law.
Mr. Root admitted that our basic
law should be redrafted but, he ad
ded, none but a prophet or seer could
do it and none such was available.
The meeting will close with the an
nual dinner of the association Friday
night.

BEMIDJI PREPARED
FOR STRIKE 30 TO
60 DAYS' SUPPLIES
Merchants Increase Stock and Plan
for Strike Sugar and Flour
to Be Scarce.
SHIPMENTS MAT BE
RECEIVED BT AUTO
Shortage in Pork and Smoked Meats
Gasoline Supply Reported to
Be Large.
Bemidji is prepared for the rail
way strike which has been called for
next Monday morning and which may
mean the tying up of the railways
for some time.
Bemidji has a thirty or sixty days'
supply of food necessities, according
to statements made by Bemidji mer
chants to a Pioneer representative.
The merchants admitted that the
supply of some articles would be ex
hausted before 30 days' time. The
supply of sugar and flour is not as
large as it should be.
Ship by Automobile.
All the merchants stated that they
were securing as large a supply as
possible and some of them have made
arrangements for the transporting of
goods in auto trucks. The gasoline
supply is good, according to the St.
Cloud Oil conpany, which will have
its maximuii of gasoline here on Sat
urday.
Transportation by auto truck will
be done from the Twin Cities over the
Jefferson highway and on return trips
to the city, produce will be shipped.
The time between Bemidji and the
Twin Cities by automobile is much
less than by freight. The eost of
shipment is less, it is stated.
The meat situation in Bemidji is
good, the only scarcity being in pork
and smoked meats. There is plenty
of beef on hand and obtainable.
Stewart is Ready.
"We have at least a 30-day supply
of necessities," said Scott Stewart,
of the Stewart grovery. "We have re
ceived shipments and have a large
supply of coffee and other articles
on hand. I look for the biggest
scarcity in sugar and flour."
All the merchants in Bemidji
stated that they did not believe that
anyone would attempt to secure con
trol of the food market in order to
increase prices and make a profit.
"We will fight any move of that
kind and will not sell goods in large
quantities," said one merchant.
30 Days Supply.
"I don't anticipate much of a
strike," said W. G. Schroeder. "If
we do have a strike I am ready for
it. We have at least 30 days sup
plies on hand and I have made ar
rangements for the securing of mea*s
and other necessities by auto truck
from various points We can secure
things by auto route much quicker
than we could secure them by
freight."
Morris Kaplan has received six car
loads of supplies within the past
week in preparation of a strike. "I
do not look for a great shortage in
anything," said Mr. Kaplan.
The Charles Nangle store has a 30
or 60 days' supply on necessities and
does not anticipate a shortage.
The Troppman store is prepared,
having a good supply on hand.
Shortage in Pork.
The Palace Meat Market is pre
pared for a strike. Any amount of
beef can be obtained but a shortage
is looked for in pork.
The Peoples Meat Market is of the
opinion that it will be able to get
along well in case of a long strike.
The only big shortage will be in
smoked meats and pork. Pork is
selling for 19 cents wholesale, it is
stated.
The Otto Schwandt store has a
good supply of necessities on hand.
SCHROEDER INSTALLS

W. G. Schroeder is installing a 30-
