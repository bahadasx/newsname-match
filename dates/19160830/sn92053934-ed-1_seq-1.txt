CONGRESS AT
WORK SEEKS
STRIKECURE
Uneasy Feeling Over Stub
born Attitude of Both
Sides in Struggle.
WILSON STILL HOPING
Direful Results of Tieup Are
Realized as Roads Issue
Freight Embargoes.
Washlne-ton. Ancr. SO. With both
side making last-hour prepara
tions for a great railway strike
next Monday morning. President
Wilson today turned all the influ
ence of his administration toward
persnading the brotherhood lead
er t postpone or rescind Iheir
order until congress had had op
portunity to act.
There were Intimations that
fhould the labor leaders continue
adamant. President Wilson even
might make a public appeal to the
railway workers thenieltes to di
rect their leaders to postpone It.
Despite denials of the labor leaders
that President Wilson or anyone else
had asked them to postpone the strike,
there were abundant evidences that
euch was the case, and somehow there
was a feeling in congress, in admin
istration circles and In other places
that a way would be found to avert
the walkout. No one knew what It
was, but the feeling prevailed.
After a conference wifh Secretary
Wilson at the department of labor, the
brotherhood leaders reiterated that no
power on earth except, a satisfactory
settlement would avert the strike and
that they had no power to rescind the
order.
Nevertheless, efforts were continued
to bring about a postponement.
First Injunction Step.
The first legal phase of the situa
tion developed with the temporary in
junction Issued by a local court In
Nebraska restraining the conductors
from calling or enforcing a 6trike on
the Union Pacific. This brought up
for the first time the effect of the
much-discussed Clayton anti-injunction
act passed by congress at the be
hest of labor. The brotherhoods" lead
ers unreservedly expressed the opin
ion that the injunction was in contra
vention of the law and could not
6tand. There were intimations that
similar injunctions might be issued in
different parts of the country where
the sentiment of the men Is known to
be against the strike.
With notices of freight embargoes
and prospective delays to passenger
traffic pouring in from all parts of the
country. Chairman Howard Elliott of
the New York, New Haven & Hartford
railroad issued a statement on behalf
of the railway executives pointing out
that passenger train service as well as
freight would be tied up.
While every effort was being made
to prevent the strike, both sides con
tinued to make preparations to meet it.
Th" senate interstate commerce
committee also considered a law pass
ed bv congress in 1S62 authorizing the
president to take possession of rail
road and telegraph lines, when, in his
Judgment, public safety might require
it. Senators remarked it was an in
teresting s'atute in the face of the ex
isting emergency. The statute passed
In the early part of the Civil war was
designed to be tn force only as long
as necessary to meet war conditions,

Besides conferring with Secretary
"i!son today, the brotherhoods' heads
talked with several members of con
gress at tiie capitol. Brotherhood of
ficials expected to confer today with
amuf-1 Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor. It was
faid that Mr. Gompers had made nn
attempt to tnduoe the brotherhoods
'o postj,f,ni? the strike, and it was not
thought that he would.
In general, brotherhood leaders in
tended t0 jight the legislative pro
gram and railway managements ex
pected to support if, but both sides
'aid plans for th strike juite as If
'8 'oming were beyond all doubt.
President Wilson still hoped the
brotherhood leaders now in Washing
ton would find means of rescinding
the strike order which they maintain
as gone beyond their Jurisdiction,
There was no unanimity of opinion
mong them as to whether the sug
gest, measure to forbid a striM
Pending investigation by a public
commission, if passed and made effec

validly to the present situation. Rail

that the legislation advocated would

EIGHT HOUR DAY IS
PARAMOUNT IDEA OF
PRESIDENT WILSON
(By John (allan OTaughlin in Chi.
cago Herald).
Vital as is every feature of -the
president's legislative program, none
promises to be more far-reaching
than that establishing an eight-hour
day as the legal basis alike of work
and of wages in the employment of
all railway employes who are actually
engaged in the work of operating
trains in interstate transportation.
It is frankly admitted by the presi
dent and his cabinet that the enact
ment of this standard of work will
mark the birth of a great social,
economic and industrial revolution
in the United States.
Short Day for All Likely.
These officials foresee the extension
of this day from certain classes of
railroad employes to all classes of
state and interstate carriers. They
foresee further the application of the
eight-hour standard beyond transpor
tation agencies. It is their expecta
tion that the eight-hour standard will
be established and maintained for
every mechanical worker in the coun
try. In other words the man who labors
with his hands will not be required
to work more than eight hours a day.
The federal government can lead the
way In this matter, first, by requiring
all industries doing government busi
ness to apply the eight-hour standard,
and, secondly, by forbidding the trans
portation in Interstate commerce of
any goods in the manufacture of
which the standard is not observed.
'ew Plan of Wilson. i
The legislative program submitted
by the president to congress yester
day recommends the most radical
remedies to settle disputes between
capital and labor ever laid before that
body by the chief executive.
While the immediate design of the
president's program is to prevent the
ordered strike, he emphasized that
the legislation suggested for enact
ment was intended to bring perma
nent relief and obviate the possibility
of the general tie-up of railroad serv
ice in the future.
In addition to the legalized eight
hour day, , the president's program
embraces compulsory suspension of
strikes and lockouts while a govern
ment board is investigating disputes
between capital and labor, authority
through the interstate commerce
commission to investigate the effect
of the eight-hour day, with the view
of allowing the railroads to Increase
their revenues so as to meet the ad
ditional expenditures entailed, author
ity to the executive to force railroad
officials and employes to operate
trains assigned to transport troops
and for other purely military pur
poses, and requirement that all ar
bitral awards Should be made Judg
ments by record of a court of law and
enforced by an impartial and authori
tative tribunal.
