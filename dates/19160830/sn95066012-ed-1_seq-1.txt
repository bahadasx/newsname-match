AUSTRIAN'S DYNAMITE TUNNEL
Civilian Population Ready to Leave
Cities of Hermannstadt and
Kronsdat.
Iondon, Aug. SO. Kumanian troops
have crossed the Red Tower pass and
are within three miles of Merinann
stadt, according to a Zurich dispatch
received hero today.
The Austriuus have dynamited t ho
railroad tunnel through tho Tomas
pass to prevent the transportation of
Rumanian troops. Preparations by
the Austiians have been made for the
exacuation of the cities of Hermann-
Btad and Kronsdadt by the civilian
population.
London, Aug. 29. To meet the exi
gencies of the situation created by
Rumania's entrance Into the war on
the side of the entente allies King Fit
dinand has ordered a general mobili
zation of his forces and is reported to
have proceeded to the front personal
ly to take command of his army.
Unofficial advices from the Ru-
mamnian front are to the effect that
the Rumanians are making furious
efforts to capture passes in the east
ern Carpathians leading into Hungary
and already they are declared to be
lighting shoulder to shoulder with
Russian troops coming from uiBulko
winu. While Berlin says that Ru
mania's attempts to pierce the pass
leading to Hermannstadt and the
Toerzburger and Toemoes passes thus
far have been futile, Vienna admits
that owing to a "far-reaching encircl
ing movement by strong Rumanian
forces" Austrian advanced detach
ments have been forced to withdraw.

DR. POND IN PHILIPPINES
Wins Distinction by Improving Health
Conditions on Islands.
Because Dr. Arlington Pond. for
merly of Rutland is too busy ac
comulishirig bin things in the Phil-
'ne8 a"d too modest to report his
. , . I..
m .'moms even 10 ins immi.v, u
Is oh.y through Vermont citizens
who are located in the eastern islands
that his relatives and old friends
learn of what lie is doing for the
health and prosperity of his chosen
home land says the Rutland News.
Leslie B. Stevens, formerly of that
city, who was for a time lieutenant
of tho constabulary on Cebu island
wrote his mother, who resides on
North Main street, that Dr. Pond is
"the most prominent man In Cebu"
anil that his work in the hospitals and
health departments of the islands is
among the greatest accomplishments
in the work of that part of the world.
The will' of Maj. Henry W. Hovey.
an ex-Yermonter, who, before his
death, was a commandant of various
departments of the Philippines, in her
lectures before Vermont audiences
says that she is sure this state does
not appreciate the place that Dr. Pond
lias won for himself for he is ono of
the greatest factors in the eastern Is
lands, Br. Pond has refused a number of
times to accept the chief medical
position of the Philippines as lie pre
ferred to retain his present position
as president of the board of health
of Cebu and the southern islands.
rhla decision was reached because
of his large interests in Cebu and
his devotion to his home island for
an acceptance of the higher position
would necessitate his removal to
manila.
As a side issuo the former Rutland
man operates three large drug stores
in cities near his home. For pastime
he is running a big coeoanut planta
tion on Which there are 70,000 trees.
A sheep ranch is taken care of during
spare moments.
For amusement he still keeps up
bis Vermont record as an athlete, for
in college days lie was a famous base
ball player. In Cebu he holds the
championship for gulf, tennis, billiards
and pool, and, what is more of a dis
tinction, he has so won the hearts of
Hie Knglish citizens that he has been
elected president of the Knglish club.
This honor can only be appreciated
when it is known that he wus the first
AmericM eVfir made a member of the
boiiid of directors.
But the greatest honors have been
conferred upon him by the govern
ment for Dr. Pond lias been sent by
the government officials to China to
study health conditions ami tho treat
ment of the eastern scourges, cholera.
typhoid and similar diseases. Only
recently he was presented an automo
bile by the province in appreciation of
his successful work in his charitable
eve ciniC
Through Dr. Pond's efforts the
pleer hospital in Cebu was con
demned and burned, and a small is
land off the coast was secured anil
devoted to the isolation and care of
patients ill with the disease.
At last reports the doctor had dis
covered 2000 cases on the Island and
these had been removed to the station
devoted to this purpose where through
Br. Pond's instrumentality, the new
hospital was built.

I
President Exerting Every Effort to Bring About
Rescinding of Order, Presents Plan of Leg
islation Before Joint Assembly Railroad Pres
ident's Statement Insists Upon Arbitration
Brotherhood Rejects Compulsory Investigation
Washington, Aug. 30. President
Wilson is exerting every effort today
to induce the Brotherhood leaders to
cancel their strike order for Septem
ber 4. It is Stated by the officials of
the Brotherhood that nothing short of
the granting of the eight-hour day will
halt the strike.
The first attempt uy congress to
dratt legislation to meet the strike
situation ended in a quarrel in commit
tee when several senators were ac
cused of attempting to make political
capital out of the critical situation.
Washington, Aug. 20. President
Wilson, laying the railway strike sit
uation before Congress today With re
commendations for legislation ad
vanced the crisis to a stage where thfl
next development depend upon two
points. They are:
Whether the legislation he pro
poses can be passed;
If enacted will it be effective to
prevent a strike already called for
7 a. m September 4.
Neither of these questions can be
answered tonight.
The brotherhood heads themselves
announcing their intention to fight cer
tain portions of the president's pro
gram are at loggerheads over whether
its enactment would prevent the
strike.
The railroad presidents, favorable to
President Wilson's plan in the main,
think it would make it dilllcult for
the strike to begin.
When the brotherhood leaders this
morning rejected the latest proposal
of the railroads and definitely set trie
strike for Labor day without lurther
notice. President Wilson decidod to
lav the whole "Ituntion before ( on-
gross. Before a joint session of
House and Senate and with a solemn
recital of the distress and disaster a
strike would bring to the country the
resident proposed a plan of legisla
tion
Immediately after the president had
delivered his recommendations con
gress set about to see how they might
lie enacted into law. Tonight. Presi
dent Wilson had a conference in (
Speaker Clark's room at the capitol. I
Beside.-- the president and the speaker I
the conferees Included Republican
Leader Mann, Democratic Leader
Kitchin, Representative Stirling of Il
linois, the ranking republican of the
House interstate commerce committee
and Representative adamson, The 1
bairman. No definite
conclusions
were reached.
President Wilson confided to advis
ers tonight his earnest nope 111111 me
brotherhoods recognising the fairness
with which lie has treated them wool I
yield to his request that pending ac-j
tlon by Congress they rennd then-
strike order. He asked the leaders to
do so at tli ii- contereiKv last night. I
hut they refused Hat ty. saving they
iid not the power. President Wilson
takes the position that in view of his
recommendations to congress the
brotherhoods have nothing to gain and j
much to lose If they carry out llvir
strike order because public opinion
will stand against them.
Meanwhile, the railroad heads pre
pared themselves for a strike. Orders
not to accept perishable Heights for
shipment were issued by many lines;
indices were issued to prospective pas
congers that unless they could colli
plete their journeys before 7 o'clock
Monday morning they would risk de-
lavs. Many Of the railway presidents

of directing the strike from Washing
ton. Both sides Issued what appeared to
he their last statements to the public
in justification of their actions.
The railway presidents summarised
le Important points developed by
their deliberations as follows:
"A renewed Insistence upon the
principle of arbitration as only
proper method of settling labor
disputes.
"An Increased reall.utlon of the
responsibility of the railroads
toward their other employes, the
shippers, the Industrial, commer
cial and general public which they
have been made to feel by thou
sands Of telegrams Insisting upon
the maintenance of their posi
tion." The brotherhoods expressed their
unalterable opposition to President
Wilson's plan to compel public lirvestl
in a statement signed ny uar-
retson,
Stone, Carter and Leo which
raid:
"Since the abolition of slavery
no more effectual means has been
devised for insuring the bondage
of the workingmen than the pas
sage of the compulsory Investiga
tion acts of the character of the
Canadian industrial disputes act."
The issue of these two statements
was the formal announcenint of tho
final positions of two great forces im
movable and still deadlocked after two
weeks of intercession arrd negotiation
