STEADILY WIDENS
Open Hostilities Are Man
ifested Between
THE MOOSE AND REPUBLICANS
Nation-Wide Bitterness Between
These Factions Is Grow
ing In Intensity.
FUEL NOW ADDED TO HATRED
New York, Aug. 28. The threat
ened nation-wide break between the
Progressives and the reactionary Re
publicans, which started In Califor
nia, has swept to tho East and is
now a menacing actuality which Is
confronting the Hughes campaign
managers.
Open hostilities have been declar
ed lu Pennsylvania, where neither
side any longer attempts to conceal
the growing bitterness of the con
flict, y
In Delaware, a third ticket has
been announced by antl-machlne Re-"
publicans in opposition to United
States Senator Henry A. Dupont,
who Is seeking renomtnatlon as the
regular Republican candidate for
United States Senator.
Equally alarming to the support
ers of Mr. Hughes are the develop
ments of the last twenty-four hours
In New. York State. Gov. Whitman,
ignoring the regular Republican or
ganization, headed by State Chair
man Tanner, has opened up inde
pendent compalgn headquarters, and
the primely fhjht for United States
Senator between William N. Calder
and Robert Bacon has resulted In
an open split in the party.
The breatt between the Republic
ans and Progressives in Pennsylva
nia, developing for several weeks,
lias been made wide open by an edi
torial in the Philadelphia Inquirer, a
pronounced stand-pat Republican
newspaper. The Inquirer yesterday
i applauded Candidate Hughes' refus
al to, confer' with Gov. Johnson on
hisislt to California, and defiantly
asalled the Progressive party of tlie
State in an editorial as follows: .
"The Progressives succeeded in
stealing the Republican party four
years ago and nominating Progres
sive candidates. This was unjust,
unthinkable. Johnson was elected
Governor two years ago by a minor
ity vote, and now he poses as a Ro-
, publican, and as such Is allowed to
contest for the senatorial nomina
tion." To-day's Philadelphia North
American, regarded ns the leading
Progressive newspaper of the East,
retorts with an editorial unsparing
ly condemning Mr. Hughes' attitude
toward California. Progressives are
demanding that Mr. Hughes tell tho
voters of tho country what he means
by his deelarnt(on that ho Is the
"spokesman of the national Repub
lican party.".
Gov. Whitman's announced deter
mination to conduct a separate pri
mary campaign, Independent of tho
regular party organisation, has fur
ther complicated tho already entang
led conditions In New York, which
are now embarrassing Mr. Hughes'
'supporters. A committee, to bo
known ns tho Whitman Primary
'j&mpaign Committee, is now in pro
cess of formation, and will have sep
arate headquarters at tfio Manhat
tan Hotel, Now York City.
In the contest for tho senatorial
nomination, Gov. Whitman is stand-1
Jng behind William N. Caldor, of.
Brooklyn, while Ellhu Root and the
old guard faction, led by William
Barnes, of Albany, are openly sup-;
porting Robert Bacou. I
Further disruption of tho Ropub-j
Ucan campaign plaua, in New York
was marked by the frank announco-roetfto-day
in tho Tribune, which,
although supporting Mr. Hughes, is1
opposed to Gov. Whitman; that his
renomJnattoR tula year would mean
"a severe handicap to tho national
ticket and a possible lpss of the
State In the local campaign." I
It seems certain that Mr. Hughes,
ou his return to- New-York from his
Western trip, will .find- tho political
COHdlttoaa prevailing hre more em
B
barrasslng and disturbing than even
those which ho encountered In the
West.

Against British Embar

OELEGMNJFJIEN SENT
To Washington To Join In Pro
testLatest Ruling Blow
To Exporters.
CHANGED POLICY UNEXPECTED
Washington, Aug. 20. A confer
ence of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mary
land and Virginia tobacco growers
and exporters will be held In tills
city on Monday to protest against
the British embargo against further
shipments of tobacco to Germany
and Austria after August 31.
Representatives of the dark tobac
co, growers of the following Ken
tucky counties are expected here
to-morrow evening for the confer
ence: Christian, Hopkins, Hender
son, McCracken, Graves, Fulton, Cal
loway, Todd and Logan. They will
keep with the delegates from Rob
ertson and Montgomery countlf3,
Tennessee, in presenting- their griev
ances to the conference.
Representatives of this industry
will confer with Senators and Rep
resentatives from their States in the
hope that means may be devised for
a modification of this embargo to
the extent that at least all shipments
now contracted for may proceed to
their destination. Otherwise enor
mous losses will be sustained by the
American exporters.
Several months ago Great Britain
lifted the embargo against ship
ments of American tobacco to the
Central Powers on the ground that
this product could In no sense be re
garded as contraband. It could not
be used to strengthen the military
power of either country or to subsist
the civilian population of either.
A few weeks ago England sudden
ly changed her policy, announcing
that only such shipments as were In
transit or such shipments as had
actually been contracted for, might
be delivered. This was a blow at
the American tobacco Interests, but
the full effect of it was not felt until
the British Government later s!ll
announced that all existing contracts
must bo filled by August 31, for to
bacco that had been bought and
paid for on or before August 4., The
tobacco people say that it is physi
cally impossible to carry out their
contracts by that time because of
the limited shipping facilities.
The conference on Monday will
probably result In laying the situa
tion before the Stato Department
with the urgent request that strong
representations be niado to Great
Britain. Tho department co-operat
ed effectively In original negotia
tions, as did Sir "Cecil Spring-Rice,
the. British Ambassador.

tho embargo. List winter, when
the British order In council went
into effect prohibiting shipments of
tobacco to any country engaged In
war against the Allies, or to any na
tion that could lh any possible waj
supply tho enemies of Great Brit
ain, the Clarksville Chamber of
Commerce took the same step that
frn3 taken this morning. They se
cured an immense petition setting
out the facts In the caso. To place
an embargo on the export tobacco
grown! in the Black Patch means
that thousands of farmers must suf
fer, thnt millions of dollars will be
