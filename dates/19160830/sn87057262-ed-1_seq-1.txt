ROME, Aug. 30.—The famous
TomoB Pass railway tunnel through
the Transylvanlan Alps has been
dynamited and completely wrecked
by the Austrians to check the Ru
manian advance on the important
city of Kronstadt.
[The Tomos Pass tunnel is about
900 feet long and is situated on the
Bucharest-Budapest railway just in
side the Transylvanlan frontier, elev
en miles south of Kronstadt.]
Sharp fighting occurred in the
Tomos Pass region a few hours after
the Rumanian declaration of war.
Rumanian detachments, advancing
from Predeal, crossed the frontier
and attacked an Austrian frontier
guard. Part of the Austrian force
was captured and the Rumanians then
withdrew to the border where they
entrenched and repulsed counter at
tacks by reinforced Austrian troops.
On the extreme wings, the Ruman
ians are pressing forward into Hun
gary with a pincer-like movement that
threatens to squeeze the Teutons out
of all southeastern Transylvania. Un
official reports from Bucharest today,
said that Rumanian vanguards which
formed a junction with the Russians
in the north have pushed forward
more than a mile into Transylvanlan
territory. The Rumanians have in
vaded Transylvania in force op the
southern border, south of Hermann
stadt and were engaged near the Red
Tower Pass when last reports were
received at Geneva.
The Austrians have made prepara
tions for the early evacuation of both
Kronstadt and Hermannstadt, the
two most important cities of Transyl
vania by the civilian population.
Artillery duela are continuing on
the Balkan front In the region of Ve
trinik and Ostrovo.
Along the western front, the usual
cannonading occurred last night.
There were no infantry attacks ex

Western Railroads Send Out Orders
for the Traveling Public to

CHICAGO, Aug. 30.—The traveling
public and shippers were warned by
western railroads today to prepare for
a strike Monday.
Shippers were notified today by a
dozen roads running out of Chicago
that perishable freight that would not
arrive at its destination on or before
Saturday would not be accepted. The
Santa Fe has already issued an order
to Its agents to refuse shipments of
perishables and live stock at once.
Other railroads taking as sweeping
action, but setting their time limit
abead to Saturday for freight deliver
ies, include:
Burlington, Northern Pacific, Rock
Island, Southern Pacific, Missouri,
Kansas and Texas, St. Louis and San
Francisco, Louisville and Nashville
and the Mobile and Ohio.
Remaining roads are expected to
take similar action within twenty
four hours.
The Southern Pacific warned all
prospective travelers they might be
subjected to "perplexing delays after
Sunday night." Other railroads noti
fied their agents to give the same
warning to travelers.
A strike of 6,000 freight handlers in
Chicago has been called for this af

General Carrqnza Issues Decree Hereafter They
Are Under Direbtion o/^L Police
MEXICO CITY, Aug. 30.—General Carranza, in^^pree made public today, announced
the nationalization of property of the Catholic church in Mexico.
The churches will be nominally controlled by the clergy. The government, however, re
serves the right to police them and prevenlt them from being used for any purpose other
than prescribed by law. The government also reserves the right to discontinue their use
as a place of worship, after one year's service.
In taking this step the first chief declared he was only reviving the idiecree promulgated
in 1859. The new order involves all property nationalized under the Juarez law and loaned
to the Catholic church or other religious bodies or ceded after the promulgation of the de
cree. The department of finance will take charge of Ithe property and see that it is cared for.
The department of gobemacion will control the opening of new churches.
Only the chief executive of the republic is empowered by the idiecree to use Catholic
property for any public service. This provision was made to prevent local municipal offi
cers from invading church property. The municipal authorities are specifically warned not
to transgress.

Second—'Brotherhoods unanimously

would prevent the strike. Railroads
have made their chief fight against
this proposition.
Third—Brotherhoods not greatly
concerned over appointment of com

effective today. Just in the heavy

CHICAGO, Aug. 30.—Produce and
live stock prices in the local markets
soared today ae additional western
railways prepared to ban perishable
freight shipments, beginning Satur
day.
Notices were posted on the floor of
the Chicago Dairy Board that the
Michigan Central, Michigan Southern
and the Baltimore and Ohio roads
would accept butter and egg ship
ments consigned to Philadelphia, New
York and Boston only until Saturday.
Produce men predicted a big rise in
butter and egg prices.
Unfavorable strike news boosted
hogs to its former high level of $11.30
a hundred pounds. Cattle showed a
gain, while sheep advanced from 15
to 30 cents per hundred pounds.
Potato prices jumped also. Minne
sota and Ohio shipments were quoted
15 cents higher at $1.35 a bushel.
Live poultry showed gains.
Interurban lines today prepared to
carry out plans to handle double
their usual traffic in case of a strike
Monday. Officials planned to convert
passenger coaches into freight cars to
handle produce shipments.
A strike will throw out of employ
ment 30,000 workers in Chicago's
stock yards.
"The embargo can only result in a
shut down for certain sections of the
packing business," said Thomas E.
Wilson, bead of Wilson and Company,
one of the large packers. "We have
stored as much as we could and we
have as much live stock in the yards
as possible. We have no more than
three days supplies ahead, however."
