PARTICIPANTS IN BREAGH-OF-PROMISE
CASE.
On account of the importance of the
case, the committee having charge of
the details of the great Mock Court
trial to be given under the auspices of
the Y. P. S. C. E. of the Congrega
tional church in Seaver's hall on Wed
nesday evening, Sept 6th, have
secured the services of Col. A. V.
Newton of Worcester, Mass., as prose
cuting attorney, while the defendant,
not to be outdone, has retained F. W.
Baldwin to defend his hitherto good
reputation.
Col. Newton is widely known a3 an
eloquent off-nand speaker, but Mr.
Baldwin will make the battle of hia
life, and will undoubtedly make it
exceedingly warm for the gentleman
from Worcester.
As there is a general desire to know
who are to take part in the trial, we
publish the list in full. It will be a
long time before so many of our prom
inent people are again seen in just
such a relation and it will be well for
all who desire an evening of rare en
joyment to be present and hear what
they have to say about the breach of
promise case.
This is the make-up of the court:
Judge, F. D. Thompson
Clerk, W. W. Reirden
Plaintiff, A. Clemma Seaver
Defendant, Wallace H. Gilpin
Defendant's attorney, Hon. F. W.
Baldwin
Prosecuting attorney, Col.
A. V.
Newton of Worcester, Mass.
Court officer, George E. Jennings
Crier, A. Slayton Lang
Witnesses, Dr. F. R. Hastings, C. A.
Barrows, Mrs. Daisy Baldwin, Miss
Aftian Scott and Dr. J. A. Pearson.
The jurors will be announced later.

WILL HAVE GUEST DAY
Barton Improvement Club to Entertain
on September 15. Everyone Invited
to Partake of Barton's Hospitality.
An idea new to this part of Vermont
is to be launched by the Barton Im
provement club by inauguarting a
"Barton Guest Day" on Friday, Sep
tember 15, when the town will throw
open its doors, so to speak to the peo
ple of the surrounding territory and
give tbem of its hospitality. There
will be free moving picture shows,
free boat rides on the lake, a free
ball eame and in the evening a
great free corn roast on the fair
ground. , '
This is simply a turn-about proposi
tion from the Barton Improvement
club, which represents the business,
professional and in a sense the social
and educational side of the town, with
the simple idea of entertaining for a
day those who make Barton their rail
road, school, mercantile or banking
center in any sense. There are abso
lutely no strings on the proposition.
There are no bargain sales on, no
advertising schemes, no catch games
of any kind, but a sincere and simple
desire to reciprocate for the patronage
the town has received from the terri
tory it endeavors to serve.
Plan now to spend Friday, Sept. 15,
in Barton as the guests of the Barton
Improvement club, and watch for fur
ther announcements and particulars.

SCHOOL OPENING POSTPONED
By recommendation of the Vermont
state board of health, as a precaution
ary measure against an epidemic of
infantile paralysis, State Commission
er of Education Hillegas has notified
superintendents to withhold the open
ing of all schools in the state until
September 18. This means that Bar
ton academy and graded school as well
as all town schools everywhere in the
state will not open before Sept. 18, not
withstanding other plans. Commis
sioner Hillegas's communication ! to
Supt. Erwin reads in part as follows :
"At a special meeting ot the state
board of health held last
eveniner. I
(Thursday, Aug. 24) it was voted to
request us to delay the opening of the
schools until September the 18th.
"Briefly summarized the situation is
as follows: No known cases of in
fantile paralysis now exist in Ver
mont. They do exist in each adjoining
state and it is believed to be inevitable
that we will have cases here. Out
breaks of this disease in Vermont
have always been a month or more
later than those in states south of us.
The members of the board of health
believe that September will be the
critical month here and that we should
take every possible precaution. No
part of the state is immune from the
disease.
"I was present at the meeting by
invitation. I assured the board that
to the extent of our ability we would
cheerfully comply with any request
that they deemed it advisable to make
of us. I know that the delay will
change the present and future plans of
many teachers, but coming now, super
intendents should be able to adjust
vacation and possibly the cate of clos
ing schools so that there can be no
excuse for any town withholding a
part of the teachers' salary."
State surveyors are doing some work
on Main street preparatory to putting
in a sidewalk on the east side of the
street. New cement sidewalks have
peen put in on Lincoln avenue and one
is being put in on Elm street. Both
were much needed.
Many persons believe the last band
concert of the season has been given,
but the Monitor is glad to say that
there are to be three more Saturday
evening band - concerts. Never before
have the concerts been so largely
patronized and enjoyed.
The ball game on the fair grounds
Saturday afternoon between Barton
and Orleans was a game much more
even than the score of 8 to 4 in lavor
of Orleans, would indicate, and when a
return game is scheduled baseball en
thusiasts will want to see it. Barton
went to pieces for a few minutes in
the seventh inning and the lead could
not be regained. Otherwise it was a
fast, tight game. Leland and Abbott
were the Barton battery and Mann and
Kipp for Orleans.
Miss Marion Bickford, so well and
favorably known in Barton, is to be
vocal music director of Montpelier
seminary the coming season. Miss
Bickford is a graduate of the seminary
and has since spent four years of hard
study in Boston, graduating from the
New England Conservatory in June.
During the past four years she has
held solo positions in large churches,
and has done considerable concert
work. Miss Bickford is the possessor
of a rich contralto voice and will
undoubtedly prove herself a popular
and pleasing singer.
The village library and reading
rooms have been moved from the Davis
block, where they have been located for
several years, to rooms in the Monitor
block on Main street. Through the
efforts of the Woman's Literary club
and the help of the village, the library
has grown until it now contains nearly
3000 volumes. The new location is
central and will accommodate as many
people as the former rooms. An extra
room has been added, using two rooms
instead of one as heretofore, for the
library and a room for the reading
room. Miss Eva Gilpin will act as
librarian, as Miss Foss who has been a
most efficient librarian for several
years, has accepted a position in Win
chenden, Mass.
POLITICAL JOTTINGS.
At that, however, from beginning to
end this has been more of a "you kick
me and I'll kiss you" administration.
Vance McCormick says the Progres
sives are stampeding to Wilson, and
it's a ten to one bet he wishes he
could believe It,
The Democrats are finding out that
pork comes home to root out their
standing.
The men and women who prefer a
man who does things to a man who
writes notes about them will vote for
Hughes. Government by correspond
ence takes too long to get anywhere,
but government by deeds is always on
the job.
Those who are concerned to know
what Mr. Hughes would have done
had he been in Mr. Wilson'r place
may rest assured he would not have
done as Mr. Wilson has. And that is
answer enough.
Mr. Hughes is not only going direct
to the public, but the public Is going
direct to him. A genuine American
fifty-fifty!
President Wilson's alarm clock Is
ringing at 5 o'clock these mornings.
He can reach out of bed and turn it
off the morning of March 5.
UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS
County Fair One of the Best in Many
Years. Attendance Large, Races
Fast, Ball Games Good.
Everyone came to the Orleans County
fair this year and went away satisfied.
At least there were never so many
compliments and so few kicks. The
attendance was large, about 8,000 on
Wednesday and 4,000 on Thursday.
Although the day for entries, Tues-
day, was extremely hot and resulted in
a slight decrease in the number of live
stock entries because of the fear of
injuring fine animals, there has not
been a better showing of local animals
on the grounds for a long time if ever.
The show was by local breeders, as the
premium awards will show in this
issue, and to which we direct the
attention of our reader for further
particulars regarding this feature.
The vaudeville features on the stage
were of unusually high order and drew
great applause from the audience and
drew many personal words of com
mendation. It was clean and extreme
ly good. The balloon ascensions were
good and the parachute drops better
than usual, although some of the won
derful stunts promised by the balloon
ist were not seen.
The ball games were both won by
North Troy, the one on Wednesday
from Lyndonville by a score of 5 to 1
and that on Thursday from Irasburg
by a score of 3 to 0. The feature of
the first game was the pitching of Ray
Collins of Burlington, a former famous
southpaw from the Boston Red Sox.
The racing summary gives the
detail of the racing events which
were fast and in many instances went
extra heats.
There were more than a thousand
entries in floral hall this year,, the
largest number ever registered. The
exhibit of needlework was of very fine
quality and many remarks were heard
from people, who have attended other
fairs, that this exhibit was the finest
, ever seen in Vermont. The superin
tendents were at a disadvantage in not
being able to display the work on
account of space. This department is
steadily growing and by the large
number of people who visit it, seem3
to be the most popular place on the
fair ground,- especially with the ladies.
What is much needed in this depart
ment is more space and more money to
be used for premiums.
The boys' stock judging contest was
held Wednesday, Aug. 23 at 10 30 a.
m. Seven boys entered this and all
did very creditable work. Four class
es of stock were jur'ged, namely, a
class of Jersey cows. &' class of Ayr
shire cows, also a class of work horses,
and one of Shropshire sheep. The boys
placed the animals in each class, one,
two, three and four and gave their
reasons on a placing: blank supplied by
the superintendent in charge. C. R.
Carlton, of the Vermont agricultural
extension service acted as superinten
dent and judge and as soon as the boys
had finished a class, he placed them
and gave his reasons for placing. The
prizes were awarded as follows : Floyd
Taylor, Glover, first prize of $10;
Clyde Bean of Glover, second prize of
$7; Lisle Bean, West Glover, third
prize of $5 and Peter Salmon, West
Glover, fourth prize of $3. Raymond
Wheelock of Mansonviiie, Que., entered
the contest and did excellent work, but
his paper had to be discarded as the
rules limited the contest to Verniont
boys.
One corner of floral hall was oc
cupied by the exhibits of the Orleans
County Agricultural association and
the Vermont Agricultural Extension
service, the former being in charge of
Ray Deuel, county agent, and the
latter, C R. Carlton. t Mr. Deuel had
some interesting results showing the
benefits derived from topdressing
meadows with chemicals, also some ex
cellent specimens of alfalfa and silage
corn. He also exhibited a one horse
sprayer for use in orchards, potato
fields, oat fields, etc., as a good type
for farmers to purchase. The exten
sion service showed a collection of
charts vividly portraying the latest
suggestions in regard to feeding
stock, raising alfalfa and potatoes,
care of poultry, etc. A series of maps
showing the work of the extension
service in Vermont during the past
three years, was also shown. A
model poultry house with roosts, nests,
etc, complete and perfect in all de
tails, attracted much attention. Of
interest to the ladies was a homemade
tireless cooker, with directions for
making same. A shadow box with a
lantern showed slides during a large
part of the time and about 200 slides
on different subjects of agricultural
interest were shown.
There were an even dozen babies
entered in the baby contest. The
judges, Drs. Prime of Barton, Lan
phear of Orleans and Buck of Glover
awarded the $10 in gold'to Stanley H.,'
five-months-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Homer Coburn of Newport Center.
The $5 in gold was awarded to Hazel
Elizabeth, five-months-old daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Lynn Anderson of Glover
and the $2.50 in gold was awarded
Charles T. , six-months-old son of Mr
and Mrs. Ellis Prescott of Barton.

MR. HUGHES OPPOSED TO
FOOLISH GOVERNMENT.
"I have no respect for the idea
that because democratic govern
ment is a government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the
people it is a government of the
foolish, for the foolish and by
the foolish." From Mr. Hughes'
Speech at Chicago.
