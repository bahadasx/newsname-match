fiad remained In the car for sevetal
minutes, a small nero boy came up
to the car and told Zapparoli that he
was wanted at the house. Leaving
the car he went up the stoop and
passed Wemet who was leaving the
place. - '

Chief Executive Makes Efforts to Have Brother
es Leaders Have Conferences With Secretary
ers Leaders Have Conferences With Secretary
of Labor on Proposed Legislation Senate
Committee Prepared for Hearings on Meas
ures Advocated in Message of President.
Washington, Aug., 30 With both sides making final pre
parations for a great railway strike Monday morning, President
Wilson today turned all the influence of his administration to
ward persuading the brotherhood leaderMo postpone or rescind
their strike order until Congress has had opportunity to act.
There were intimations that should the labor leaders con
tinue obdurate, President Wilson even might make a public ap
peal to the railway workers themselves to direct their leaders
to postpone it. ,
Despite denials of the labor leaders that President Wilson
or anyone else had asked them to postpone the strike, there were
abundant evidences that such was the case and, somehow, there!
was a feeling in Congress, in administration circles, and in other;
places that a way woulcj be found to avert the walkout. No one'
knew what it was, but the feeling prevailed. ;
After a conference with Secretary Wilson at the department
of labor, the brotherhood leaders reiterated , that no power on
earth except a satisfactory program would avert the strike and
that they had no power to rescind the order.
Nevertheless, the efforts were continued to bring about a
postponement.
The first legal phase of the situa
tion developed with the temporary in
junction issued by a local court In
Nebraska restraining ' the conductors
from calling or enforcing a strike on
the Union Pacific., This brought up
for the first time the effect of the
much discussed Clayton antl-lnjunc-tion
act passed by Congress at the
behest of labor. The brotherhood lead
ers unreservedly expressed the opin
ion that the Injunction was in contra
vention of the law and could not
stand.
There were Intimations that similar
injunctions might be sued out in dif
ferent parts of the country where the
sentiment of the men is known to be
against the strike. ' '
With notices of freight embargoes
and prospective delays to passenger
traffic pouring in from all parts - of
the country, Chairman Howard El
liott, of the New Haven, issued a
statemen. oh behalf pfiieiraiiway-
ecutives, -pointing out that passenger
train service as well as freight would
be tied up. . ' '
While every effort was being made
to prevent the strike both sides con
tinued to make preparations to meet
it.
The" Senate Interstate commerce
committee also considered a law pass
ed by Congress In 1862 authorizing the
President to take possession of rail
road and telegraph lines when, in his
judgment public saftey might .require
it ' '
Senators remarked It was an Inter
esting statute In View of the existing
emergency. The measure passed in
the early part of the Civil War was
designed to be in force only as long
as necessary to meet the war condi
tions. . i

"Those- who haVe not followed the ,
subject careful'y and do not under

from the President's' language that a

the case, and Included in the order
to strike are all men in passenger
