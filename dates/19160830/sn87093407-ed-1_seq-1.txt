"God Forgive You;

WASHINGTON. Aug. 30.—
"God forgive you; I cannot."
President Wil»on, it became
known today, thus concluded his
final Interview with the railroad
executives at the White House
yesterday, when they submitted
their final proposition, reiecting
every effort and suggestion the

WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.—
President Wilson Is exerting
every effort to secure from the
railroad brotherhood leaders a
withdrawal of their strike or
der, effective September 4.
Believing that congress is
certain to pass legislation such
as the brotherhoods are de
manding, administration of
ficials have pointed out the
trainmen would have nothing
to gain by striking, and every
thing to lose.
In fart, tlioy say If the men carry
out their strike orders while con-
Kress is actually dehatlnff on uieas
iirea favorable to labor, there will
be a tremendous reaction In the
country against the union men that
might turn the entire trend of
events.

SENATE ACTS
TO STAVE OFF
LABOR WAR
HIGH SPOTS OF STRIKE
Railroads and employes prepare
for strike September 4, at 7 a. m.
Senate plans to rush thru anti-strike
legislation asked by President Wilson
Tuesday.
Railways refuse shipments of fruit,
live stock and other perishable freight.
Passenger traffic warned of likely
delays.
Seattle doesn't face same prospect
of food shortage that most cities of the
country face.
Senate interstate commerce com
mittee sets formal hearing on anti
strike legislation for Thursday morn
ing.
U. P. conductor at Omaha enjoins
enforcement of strike order.
While the railroad strike
would raise hob with all Wash
ington products depending for
their msrkets outside the stste,
Seattle will be reasonably sup
piled with necessities, such as
meat, frutt, vegetables, fish,
and grain thru its water trans
portation and by means of ln
terurban lines. In this re
spect It is more fortunate than
moat cities.
The fruit, grain, snd fish in
dustries of the stste. most of
which is deoendent upon East
srn markets, will suffer enor
mously, however, If the strike
Is prolonged.
So will lumber, tho trans
portation of this product to
other markets has been con
ducted mostly by water.
TiansconfUiental railroad com
panles running out of Seattle Wed
nesday discontinued to sccept per
ishable and live stock shipment,
that would not reach their destina
tion before September 2, because
of the Impending strike.
No restrictions on passenger
traffic, however, had befn issued
Thru tickets are being sold, and
no local official# were able to pre
diet what move would be made to
handle the public In case of lite
strike being called Monday.
Take Short Shipments
All short shipments of perish
able freight were being taken, and
W was predicted, will continue to
ne taken, even tho the strike Is
called.
' There is no doubt but what all
railroads will make a desperate ef
fort to keep things moving.'' said
a high-up Great Northern official
Most of the freight refusals, It
was announced, are being made
east of the Cascade mountains,
and apply to long hauls across the
continent.
General freight which would not
suffer from delay will be accepted
continually. It was predicted, but
subject to such delay as unfore
seen strike developments might
bring.
The meat supply already on
hand In Seattle will last at least
two weeks In case of a railroad
itrll<e. according to estimates of
the leading packers, Wednesday.
That some cattle can be shipped
from the San Juan Islands and the
Peninsula, by boats, to Seattle, is
another source of supply on which
local men place much reliance.
C. 11. Frye, of Frye & Co., takes
a most optimistic view of It. He
said:
"We supplied the market when
there were no railroads here, and
In Alaska, where neither rail npr
water facilities exist. We can
walk the cattle on hoof. If need
be."
Armour & Co. will have a two
weeks' supply, the local office
claimed. As It depends on the
Kast. this company will then have
to wult for the strike settlement.
Oarstens & Co., local packers,
with a slaughter house in Tacoma.
will depend on water transporta
tion and on the Interurhan. While
somewhat handicapped, the Car
htens company « xpeeta to fill or
ders for some time.
BY J. P. YODER
U. P. Staff Correspondent
WASHINGTON. Aug. 30.—
The first formal effort of con
gress to rush thru legislation
to prevent the strike of 400,000
railroad men, set for Monday
morning, ended temporarily In
a quarrel today when bitter
charges were made that cer
tain senators are "attempting
to make political capital out of
a disastrous situation."
The charges were made by
Senator Robinson, Ark. They
followed remarks In committer
by Senator Cummins and oth
er republicsns.
These senators. It was stated, de
clared thit since the date had been
set and that a strike appears to be
Inevitable, there is no need to rush
thru hastv legislation that might
afterwards prove Inadequate to
hold for all time as law.
' The strike Is not Inevitable,"
Robinson was quoted as saying.
"It seems to me that at a time like
this, when the nation Is faciug the
most disastrous Industrial situation
In history, members of all parties
should stand together, regardless
of party or personal ambitions."
The meeting grew so stormy that
the committee adjourned the ses
sion after passing a resolution
agreeing to hear the employes, the
managers and the shippers in the
senate office building tomorrow.
Just before adjournment, however,
the committee decided to meet
again this afternoon.
J. Ham Lewis Starts It
The first I gislatlve step on th«
floor of either house was taken
early this afternoon when Senator
I.ewls. Illinois, introduced two res
olutions.
The first was an amendment to
the Interstate commerce act, pro
viding for two additional mem
bers of the commission and di
vision of the proposed nine mem
bers into three sections of three
members cach. teach section, un
der the amendment, would be as
signed to certain districts, thereby
necessitating repeal of the orig
inal act, which provides that the
commission shall sit only In the
District of Columbia. Arrange
ment Is being made for joint ao
tion by all three sections "when
necessity demands."
The second resolution provides
that railroads "whenever neceg
klty exists for Increasing wages or
readjusting hours of labor" can
apply to the commission for rate
increases to meet such losses.
Both resolutions wore referred
to the interstate commerce com
mittee.
STRKE CERTAIN
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.—
"No power under hsaven, short
of a satisfactory settlement by
the railroads can prevent th«
railroad men from striking La
bor day." W. G. Lee, train
men leader, declared this aft
ernoon after talking with Sec
retary of Labor Wilson.
