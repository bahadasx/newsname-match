But now sll la serene again. The

"careful" management of the
State's finances by the Demo

Ths tronblss ia ths Republican
state Committee will not extend
to the Republican voters of Mia

over the election of the State
Chairman wca clearly the effect
of St. Louis brewsry politics

ths chairman against the wishes
of a majority of the committee.

Missouri this year the breweries
have played a bold :jame for life.
They influenced the nomination
of both the Republican and Dem

has no choice then either one
way or the other. Hnt the Dem

That is the difference between

A Republican victory in Mis

Progressive nominee for Senator
received votos in the district
which undoubtedly came from
tho Republican ranks This
would indicate all the more
strongly that Hensley was elect,
ed by Republican votes.
Hut the question really is. can
he do it again' Rhodes, the Re
publican nominee this year is a
msn who can bo counted on to
get the full party vote with the
exception of those who "scratch"
because of personal friendship
for Hcnsley. This will be over
balanced by those who will
"scratch" in Rhodes' favor. If
liie v-oie was to do UKcn on a
strictly party line it would bo an
"even bet" but there was nevsr
a time when tLe voters were o
independent in their thinking as
now- We believe that the only
hope the Democrats can have in
carrying the district this fall is
to find more Democrats that did
not vote two years ago, for every
