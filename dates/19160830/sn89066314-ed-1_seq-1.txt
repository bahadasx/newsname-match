RAILROADS REFUSE
TO CARRY FREIGHT
Eastern and Western Lines
Are Clearing Tracks of
Perishable Freight.
PREPARE FOR STRIKE
Railways Give Notice No
Shipments to Be Taken-
After Saturday.
n? United Tress.
NEW YORK. Aug. 30. Eastern
railroads and those in the West are
preparing for the impending strike
by clearing their tracks of all per
ishable freight. The Pennsylvania
announced this afternoon that "no
freight" would be carried after Sat
urday. The Sante Fe has placed an
embargo on livestock. The Cotton
Belt placed an embargo on freight,
which will take effect before Satur
day. A majority of the other roads
put the embargo today on all perish
able freight and livestock that cannot
reach its destination on or before
Saturday morning.
Reports from Minneapolis say that
the great flour mills of the Northwest
will be closed down in a week.
Railroad mail service will be
paralyzed the instant the country
wide railroad strike order goes into
effect.
The Hill lines today simultaneously
clamped an embargo on all shipments
of freight. These lines are the North
ern Pacific, the Great Northern and
the Burlington.
Most of the roads in the Southwest
have placed an embargo on perishable
goods. The result is that this re
gion is cut off almost entirely.
The cmbargos have caught the
Southwest at a time when a great fi
nancial loss will result. The melon
growers are in the middle of their
market season. Fresh meats, butter,
eggs, vegetables, milk, fruits, ice and
hundreds of cars of livestock were
refused today because of the embar
go, other goods being carried at
"owner's risk for delay."
MISSOUICIAN RECEIVES
THE BASEBALL SCOKES
The Daily Missourian has
made arrangements to receive
the scores of the National and
American league teams daily
over the wires of the United
Press Association. Since the
Missourian goes to press before
the scores can be received, it
will be impossible for them
to be published, so for con
venience, they will be posted in
the window of Peck's Drug
Store on Broadway. Scores
will be received about 5 o'clock
when the teams are playing in
the East and about 3:30 when
they are playing in the West.

Whittle and Hockaday Get
Coal Contract 6 cents
Higher This Year.
The City Council met last night and
voted that the City Engineer be in
structed to prepare an estimate of the
cost cf filling in Flat Branch from
Christian Cpllosc avenue to Eighth
street. As soon as this Is prepared
and filed and bids are roieived for
the work, the council is expected to
pass an ordinance whereby the con
tract for the work will' be let and the
branch filled. The property owners
in the adjacent section have subscrib
ed 'about ?400 to assist in carrying
out the task.
At the meeting last night George
W Barkwcll appeared before the
council with a petition signed by
himsclf and other property owners
living on Hickman avenue requesting
that the city take some action in im
proting that street from Third ave
nue to Eighth street. A motion was
made bv Councilman Shaw after the
petition was read that the City Clerk
be insturcted to draw up an ordi
nance ordering the street paved. Mr.
Shaw's motion carried.
The council passed an ordinance to
establish a grade on Park avenue from
Third avenue to First street. An or
dinance was also passed to estab
lish a grade en First street from
Broadway to Park avenue.
' BUs were received for the paving of
West Broadway from the terminal of
the present pating West to the City
limits. J D. Lyon and George W.
Barkwell were the only two bidders
for this work. Mr. I.jon was award
ed the contract. His bid was $4,9G3.
72. The preliminary work for the
paving was begun today.
As a result of the request that the
council has made for the rd:eipt of
bids for the supply of coal for the
Water and Light Department for the
coming year enly one coal firm has
made a request for the contract.
That was the Whittle & Hockaday
Coal Company, a local concern. Al
though their price per ton was about
6 cents higher than the city paid last
year their bid was accepted on ac
count of the probability of the threat
ened strike coming at a time when
the city's old contract for coal will ex
pire. J. W. Vesser, a resident on Thilly
avenue, appeared before the council
last night and asked that he and other
property owners on Thilly avenue be
allowed to construct a sidewalk on
the West side of that street from
Broadway to the South end of Mr.
Vesser's property- The council grant
ed the request. t
After the regular business of the
counfcil had been gone over. City Clerk
John S. Bicknell began the reading of
thirteen revised statutes that have
been prepared by City Attorney George
Starrett and Lake Price. The mem
bers remained until late in the night
to hear and approve the new city
laws. At the next meeting of the
council next Tuesday night Mr. Star
rett says that he hopes to have ready
for the approval of the members the
last of the revised ordinances. As
scon as these are approved the man
uscripts of the entire code of revised
laws will be ready for the printers.

A Condensed Suiiimarj of Views on
Possible Strike.
By United Preas.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 30. Following
is a summary of views held by rail
road managers and railway brother
hood chiefs of the six proposals of
President Wilson:
First, brotherhoods arc passive
regarding any plan to enlarge
membership or widen scope of
the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. Railroads heartily approve
these suggestions.
Second, brotherhoods unani
mously want establishment of an
8-hour day by law. Some think
such action would prevent strike.
, Railroads hate made their chief
fight against this proposal. '
Third, brotherhoods not greatly
concerned over appointment of a
commission to study effect of an
S-hour day on operation cost3.
Railroads desire such a Commis
sion if the 8-hour law is inetita
ble. Fourth, brotherhoods oppose in
principle only suggestion that
Congress explicitly approve In
terstate Commerce Commission
because of increased freight
rates; believe the roads are mak
ing enough now to grant de
mands. Railroads favor any move
to gite them increased freight
rates but are doubtful of result
of such consideration.
Fifth, brotherhoods activity op
posed as 'un-American "forcing
men to work when they do not
want to," which they say would
be the result of the creation of
a commission to investigate labor v
disputes, with the protiso that the
strike would be' unlawful during,
any investigation. Railroads spe
cifically ask for such a commis
mission. Sixth, brotherhoods do not op
pose giving the President powen1
to operate trains ,in event of mili-
tary necessity, provided f "only
trains needed for military pur
poses are thus operated. Ra'il
roads favor any measure that will
keep trains running if a strike occurs.
Union Pacific Conductors
Are Granted Injunction
Preventing an Order for
Strike on That Line.
By United l'res.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30. The tirst
legislative step on the floor of either
house was taken this aftcroon when
Senator Lewis of Illinois introduced
two resolutions.
The first was an amendment to the
Interstate Commerce Commission act,
providing for two additional members
of the commission and a division of
the proposed nine members into three
sections.
Each section under the amendment
would be assigned to certain dis
tricts, thereby necessitating repeal of
the original act, which provides the
commission shall sit only in the Dis
trict of Columbia.
The second resolution provides that
railroads, whenever necessity exists
for increasing wages or readjusting
hours of labor, "can apply to the com
mission for rate increases to meet
such losses."
Both resolutions were referred to
the Interstate Commerce committee.
Suspends Rate Raise.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30. The In
terstate Commerce Commission this
afternoon suspended until December
30 increased trans-continental rates
recently proposed by coast-to-coast
carriers.
The proposed schedules are sus
pended because "the rights and privi
leges of the public appear to be in
juriously affected," says the order.
Tries to Atert Strike.
By United Tress.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30. President
Wilson this afternoon was exerting
every effort to secure from the rail
road brotherhood leaders a with
drawal of their strike order effective
Labor Day, Monday, September 4. .
Believing that Congress is certain
to pass legislation such a3 the
brotherhoods are demanding, admin
istration officials pointed out this
afternoon that the trainmen would
hate nothing to gain by striking and
everything to lose.
i The fact, they say, is that if the
men carry out
while Congress
their
is actually debating
strike orders

riously injured and sixty-seven- slight
ly injured of the crew of the cruiser

S. D. Gromer, assistant professor
of economics, will leave in his car

ty. Professor Gromer will return to
Columbia for the opening of school
September 18.
Russell Monroe on Vacation.
Russell Munroe, assistant univer
sity publisher, began his vacation this
week. He will be away from his
duties for a month.
on measures favorable to labor, there
would be a tremenduous reaction in
the country against the union men
that might turn the entire trend of
events.
Thus far,- howeter, the brotherhoods
have indicated no intention of re
scinding their etrlke order.
Asked today if he had been direct-
ly requested to postpone the "strike,
A. B. Garreston, one of the train
men, replied:
, "We have not."
He gave the same answer to a ques
tion as to whether he had postponed
the strike.
Can't Prevent Strike.
"No power under Heaven, short of
a satisfactory settlement by the rail
roads, can prevent the railroad men
from striking. Labor Day," W. G.
Lee, leader of the trainmen brother
hood, declared this afternoon, after
talking with Secretary of Labor Wil
son.
It is the hope and belief of ad
ministration officials that following
the President's action of yesterday
there will 'be no immediate response
from the country urging delay of any
strike action by the employees until
Congress has had time to pass the
legislation before it.
The railroad strike, tying "tip every
piece of rolling stock in the country,
will be in effect Monday morning,
brotherhood men insisted this after
noon. The order for It includes every
brotherhood man in the United States,
both in passenger and in freight traf
fic. While the freight men arc the only
