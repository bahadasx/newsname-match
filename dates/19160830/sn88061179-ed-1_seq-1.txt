tonj million to be used on
reads in Government Korest
Konorves. This provision of
the Federal Government, to?
gether with the recent floods
which have visited largo areas
in tin* Southern Appalachian
region, have croated problems
for this general section which
can bo most successfully met
by tho get together of all those

out this general region.
Therefore, tho subjects which
will be discussed in detail at
this Convention will be Federal
Aid, with particular reference
to the provisions of the act, and
tie- .mention of Koatl Mainten?
ance. This latter subject is of
e.-pecial interest in view of the
fact that one of the provisions
of the Federul Aid bill is that
Maintenance for roads con?
structed with this Federal co?
operation must be provided by
the states receiving such aid.
Among those who will discuss
the Federal Aid Head bill are

Public Roads; Mr. Henry (!.
Shirley, President of the Amer?
ican Association of Stale High
way Officials, and State Road
Engineer of Maryland; Prof.
0. M. Strahan, of tint Highway
Department of the University
of Ueorgiu and others.
These questions will nlso be
iliscussed by the Highway Of
licalB of the stales included in

Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgie, Alabama,
Tennessee aud Kentucky.)
Other subjects to be discuss?
ed are the "Use of the Automo?
bile Tax in Road Work"; "Use
of States' Prisoners on Public

In connection with this Con?
vention there will be held tho

tucky Good Roads Association

gates are expected to attend
from tho State of Kentucky who
will also take part in the pro?

Dante Wins
Close Game
j Big Stone Gap Loses by Score
of 2 to 1 in Exhibition
Game
Iu an exhibition game h?re
ISaturday before a crowd of
I about 800 people Dante won
from the borne team in one of
the closest and hardest fought
gutnesuvar wituessed in this sec?
tion. It was a pitchers battlo
from begining to end between
Peebles and Wright, both ac?
complishing a feat that will
hardly bo equaled again, they]
yielding a bit euch to their op?
ponents, one of which was a
home run drive und a two base
bit. Dante mado thoir two
scores right in the first inning,
clue partly to Wrights wildness.
Dubbs, the first hitter tip hit
a grounder to Jones. Wriglit
took tho throw at first hut fail?
ed to touch the bag and Duhbs
was called safe. D. Taylor
walked but was doubled up at
lirst when (Silly leaped high in
the air und pulled down
demon's fierce lino tlrivo to
right with one band. Alexan?
der was hit by a pitched ball.
Adams doubled to left scoring
jDubbsand Alexander. After
Itbis Wriglit was invincible anil |
I only one man reached second,
McUall getting there on an ex-l
tretnely close decision. Peebles,
tbo southpaw, could not bo
touched Bitfely but one time
and only twenty-eight men
faced him. It appearing for
awhile that he was guiii"; to I
pitch a no-bit game, but Pick?
erel broke the spell in the
seventh inning by hitting to
ri^ht held for a clean home
run. Potter, the lirst batter up
for Big Stone Qap was robbed
of a hit when demons pulled j
down bis terrilic smash with
ono hand.
The game was full of excite-]
meht and several sensational
lidding stunts gavo the fans
an exhibition of the fastest bull
playing ever seen here. The
local club took their defeat
good humor, being satisfied
that they were defeated by on?
ly a small margin which was
duo to lucky breaks of the
game, but were loud in tholr|
praise of the Dante club, who
everybody knows is one of tin
strongest ball team in this sec?
tion.

CALOMEL DYNAMITES A
SLUGGISH LIVER.
Crashes Into Sour Bile, Mak?
ing You Sick and You
Lose a Day's Work.
Celomol salivates! It's mer?
cury. Calomel acts like dyna?
mite on a sluggish live. When
calomel cornea into contact
with sour bile it crashes into it,
causing cramping and nausea.
If you feel bilious, headachy,
constipated and all knocked
out, just go to your druggist
and get a 51) cent bottle of Dod?
son's Liver Tone, which is a
harmless vegetable substitute
for dangerous calomel. Take
u spoonful and if it doesn't
start your liver and straighten
you up better and quicker than
nasty calomel and without
making you sick, you just go
back and got your money.
If you toko calomel today
you'll be sick and nauseated to?
morrow; besides, it may sali?
vate you, while if you take
Dodson's Liver Tone you will
wake up feeling great, full of
ambition and ready for work or
play. It's harmless, pleasant
and safe to give to children;
they like it.?adv.
