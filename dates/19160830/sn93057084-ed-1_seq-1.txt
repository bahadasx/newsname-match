'•That Kansas Lesson.''
•5 Thr- Kansas people hare tried
prohibition for thirty six year?
and are so satisfied vith thr if-sults
that every political party in the
state champions prohibition as the
onlv state policy.'' The above
significant statement appearing
recently in the columns of that,

lit not to be without
great, weight especially .n those
stales so soon to dcclare them
selves by vote upon the vital issue,
state wide prohibition. The ex­
perience of a commonwealth is not
unlike that of an individual, it is
worthy of the earnest attention of
those contemplating important
steps in life. And when conclu
sions are reached iu either case af
ter mature deliberation in the rea
lization of results there is ample
reason for the most paiustaking
and faithful adherance to the les
sons conveyed. Let it be remem
bered loo that not only in Kansas
but in other states as well there
were political parties that v.'ere not
at the first particularly friendly to
the cause of prohibition but who
have been led to see by the years
of test that prohilition is an indis
pensihle asset. And now their
testimony ought not to be set aside
by any party or state seeking the
public welfare. From present in
dications Nation wide Prohibition
is not. very distant, and every Mate
voting "Dry" in these momentous
days is only hastening the coming
of the glad era when not only will
this land be saloonless but will also
be free from the liquor traffac in
any form.
