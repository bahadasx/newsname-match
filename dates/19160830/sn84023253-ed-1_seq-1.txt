AN UNCOMPLETED BURGLARY
Rev. Wileoek of Lyndon Loses Watch
Other Valuables Untouched.
Lyndon, Aug. 24. What looks like
an uncompleted burglary occurred at
the home of Rev. Fred Wilcock, of
Lyndon, pastor of the Methodist Epis
copal church, some time between 9.30
a. m. and 5.30 p. m., Monday, when
someone evidently entered the house
while Mr. and Mrs. Wilcock were
away and took a Waltham gold-cased
watch from oft a bureau In the bed
room. Although there were . other
valuables In the room, a lady's gold
watch lying on a chair nearby, and a
sum of money in bureau drawer, noth
ing except the watch was taken.
Which made it look as if the intruder
was frightened away before he had a
chance to take anything else. The
loss of the watch Is felt keenly by Mr.
Wilcock, not because of its intrinsic
value but because it was a gift from
his mother, now deceased, on his 21st
birthday. The watch is an open-face
Waltham. On the back of the case
the initials F. W., are engraved and
with an inscription, and the date, July
13, 1913, engraved on the inside.
The baseball game scheduled for
Thursday has been cancelled but
there will be games Friday and Sat
urday with the Fabyans and the Ital
ian Athletic club of Barre, respectively.
