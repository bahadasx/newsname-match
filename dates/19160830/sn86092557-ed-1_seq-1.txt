A group of whistling girls amused
the entire assemblage this morning
at the Marlon county teachers' insti

program at the Miller school. Francis
"Wheeler, the music director, in an at
tempt to have all the teachers loin in

can sing please do so. If you can't sing
yell, and If not willing to yell, whis

whistle both loud and clear.
The program as a whole today was
probably the best of the week, and
all of those present were attentive lis

this morning gave a short address on

a certain extent on charity for fhelr
malntalnance. Only about ten per
cent, had bank accounts. In this con

money wasted each year on luxuries
such as liquor, tobacco, amusements,
which by comparison made the
amounts spent for necessary and char

WASHINGTON, A u J. 30.?
Twenty-eight companies of coast
artillery troops, approximately
6,000 men now on border duty as
provisional infantry units attached
to the mobile army were ordered
back today to their posts In the
eastern and western departments.
Moro than 10,000 additional

WASHINGTON, Aug. 30?With both
sides making last hour preparations
for a great railroad strike Monday
morning President Wilson today turn
ed all the influence of his administra
tion to persuading the Brotherhood
leaders to postpone or rescind their
strike order until Congress has had
opportunity to act.
There were intimations that should
the labor leaders continue adamant
President Wilson might make a public
appeal to the railroad workers them
selves to direct their leaders to post
pone it.
Despite denials of labor leaders
that President Wilson or any one else
had asked them to postpone the strike,
there were abundance of evidence that
such was the case and somehow there
was a feeling in Congress, in adminis
tration circles and other places that
a way would be found to avert a walk
out.
No one knew what it was but the
feeling prevailed.
The first legal phase of the situa
tion developed with the temporary in
junction issued by a local court in
Nebraska restraining the conductors
from calling or enforcing a strike on
the Union Pacific. This brought up for
first time the effect of the much dis
cussed Clayton anti-injuctlon act pass
ed by congress at the behest of labor.
The brotherhood leaders unreserved
ly expressed the opinion that the in
junction was In contravention of the
law and could not stand.
There were intimations that similar
injunctions might be sued out in dif
ferent parts of the country where the
sentiment of the men is known to be
against * strike.
The Senate Interstate Commerce
committee considered a law passed by
Congress in 1862 authorizing the Pres
ident to take possession of railroads
and telegraph lines when in his judg
ment public safety might require it.
Senators remarked it was an interest

emergency. The statute passed in the
early part of the Civil war was design
ed to be enforced only as long as nec
essary to meet war conditions.

AUTO HEARSE BUILT BY
FAIRMONT UNDERTAKER
With His Own Hands And In Accordance With His Own
Ideas R. L. Cunningham Constructs Fine
Funeral Car.
An elaborate automobile funeral car
appeared on the streets of Fairmont
the other day and was used in a recent
funeral. This fact in itself is not so
remarkable but when it was learned
that the new funeral car was the work
of one man in Fairmont it created con
siderable comment.
The new funeral car is the property
of Cunningham's undertaking estab
lishment and is wholly the work of R.
L. Cunningham, former sherlft of this
county and a prominent local business
man. Mr. Cunningham for a long
time past has desired a motor driven
funeral car and on several occasions
sought to have professional automo
bile body building Arms make a fu
neral car according to his ideas of
what was needed in this section of the
country. The body builders however
had their own designs and ideas that
they wished to follow, so Mr. Cun
ningham, who is a most versatile old
gentleman wk~ ideas of his own, de
termined to build the car himself.
Early this spring he quietly began
the work and after securing a large
Packard Chassis of the model known
as the '12-48 series, and having it thor
oughly overuauled and rebuilt he be
gan the building of the body. It w;3
necessary sometimes to send to other
towns nearby to secure the proper sort
of matefial needed, although most of
it was purchased in Fairmont. The
greatest patience and care was need
ed in the work, as sometimes things
did not work out Just right, and vhile
Mr. Cunningham, as he says, "Had the
kind of car I wanted pictured in my
mind," yet he had no plans or blue
prints to guide him. some days he
worked several hours and other days
when there were funerals to be he!a
very little work was done.
Now the car is completed and toda/
was taken to Dietrich's carriage shop
on Cleveland avenue to be palm*.-. it
was used the other day. with but the
grey priming paint covering the wood
but when completed will be a hand
some glossy black, resulting from
about twenty more coats of paint and
varnish' that are yet to be applied.
In appearance the car Is of most
graceful proportions and classic de*

. REED WINS
Has Best Bed of Yellow
Flowers in the
City.
Mrs. B. F. Reed, of this city, was
awarded the prize of five dollars offer
ed by the local Political Equality Club
for the prettiest and best arranged bed
of flowers grown from the suffrage
seeds which were sold this spring. The
awarding of the prize money was an
nounced last night by Mrs. Frank C.
Dudley, chairman of the committee
appointed to award the prize. Mrs.
'Ed Kelley, of this city, was the other
member of the committee.
Several other beds were grown in
different places in the city which were
good, one other especially, that of Mrs.
Frank P. Kelley. deserving special
mention.
The bed which took the prize was
located on the lawn surrounding the
Reed home, corner of Jackson street
and Clevelan davenue, and was artis
tically arranged. The seed from which
the beds were grown was sold last
spring by the local suffrage organiza
tion in packages ot Zo cents each and
at that time it was announced that a
prize of five dollars would be award
ed for the best bed grown from these
flowers.
Tennis Tourney
at Country Club
The tennis tournament for boys un
der sixteen given by Miss Sue Kears
ley Watson, started this morning at
the Country club. The entries were
all in and the playing began about
10:30. The results for the first rounu
in singles were: Jones defeated Lay
man 6-1, 6-2; Conaway defeated Robb
6-3, 6-4; Watson defeated Hart 5-4,
6-1; Kelly defeated Cook 6-1, 6-3. Small,
Klaw, Hartley and Miller, each drew a
bye. The doubles will be started to
morrow morning and probably the
semi finals in the singles will be reach
ed by that time. The courts were in
excellent condition today and the boys
will play this afternoon and evening.
and the motor capable of developing
75 or 80 horse power, while the entire
car 1b electrically lighted with batter
ies, switches and all superfluous equip
ment concealed so that from the out
side nothing interferes to mar the beau
ty of the lines.
The body that holds the casket is
separate from the driver's compart
ment and is lower and narrower than
the usual type of motor funeral car.
This lends symmetry to the general
appearance and carries out the idea
of Mr. Cunningham who says that tho
high top-heavy conventional type of
auto car or hearse is not adapted to
the roads and narrow streets found in
this section of West Virginia.
Every detail that could possibly add
to the perfection of the car hus been
thought of, so that it is provided with
all manner of devices for m-st every
purpose. Two large headlights and
two handsome side lamps together
with a tail lamp and a beautiful dome
light inside the casket compartment
are all wired separately so that one
can be operated independently of any
of the others. Speedometer and clock
allow the driver to always reach his
destination at the appointed time. A
speaking tube from the rear opening
of the casket compartment to the
oriver has been provided. Beneath the
casket compartment is a cunningly
concealed drawer that slides out al
lowing plenty of room for the casket
lowering apparatus and for spare
tires.
Tho sides of the car are paneled
with appropriate carving and scroll
designs in the wood and as soon as
the painting is completed will be reaay
for use by those who desire to be tak
en to their last resting place with the
minii lum amount of jar and jolt. Mr.
I Cunningham is of a modest nature
i and only a few of his beBt friends knew
; that he was building the car before it
j appeared fn public. When he first
i entered the undertaking business more
than forty years ago it was customary
for all undertakers to build their own
caskets instead of buying them ready
made as is now done. In this way Mr.
Cunningham learned to do fine cabi
net work'and from "building a large
casket.lt-waa but a small step to build-,
.ingulf funeral car.
