Supply of Meat "Will Be Cot Off
in Few Days.
Before night perishable freight traf
fic In the west will be paralyzed and
movement of all other freight will be
only spasmodic. That condition was
acknowledged as unavoidable here to
day when five Kansas railroads had
declared embargoes on all perishable
freight and announced that all other
freight would only be accepted subject
to delay.
With the cloud of the greatest strike
in the history of the nation, that of
the engineers, conductors, firemen
and brakemen, settling lower every
minute, the roads took that drastic
measure as the first step toward mini
mizing the menace.
The Santa Fe was the first to de
clare an embargo. Immediately after
the president s speech in Washington,
Tuesday afternoon, a code telegram
flashed from Washington to the gen
eral offices here and at 3:30 o'clock
the railroad, thru J. R. Koontz. gen
eral freight agent, issued an order
and ten minutes later every agent on
the entire system had been notified
not to accept perishable freight for
shipment to any point or from any
connecting line. All agents were no
tified to inform shippers that imper
ishable freight would be accepted
only at the shipper's risk. In Topeka
the order exploded like a bombshell.
Union Pacific Follows. .
Following the Santa Fe's order the
Lnion Pacific declared an embargo
against all freight that can
not be delivered before Sept. 2 at 8
o'clock this morning. All other freight
is subject to delay." The order was is
sued from Omaha and received here
in the freight offices of the road a few
minutes afterward. - .
The TJnioti. PaciXie-.-end Santa1Te
embargoes leave Topeka shippers with
only two railroads, the Rock Island
and Missouri Pacific,' on which embar
goes have not been ordered.
Such steps, however are expected
any moment. The shipment of perish
able goods to destinations that can
not be reached before Monday morn
ing, from towns between Topeka and
Lawrence is shut off, and would be
be even if the Rock Island does not
declare an embargo as that road is not
allowed by the Union Pacific to do
business in that territory.
Bnrlington in Line.
The Burlington Route, which with
the Union Pacific feeds a great terri
tory in northern and western Kansas,
has declared an embargo similar to
that of the Union Pacific. A perish
able freight embargo goes into effect
on the Briseo at noon today. This will
affect towns in southeastern Kansas.

IT WILLNOT WORK
Compulsory Arbitration Is Im
possible, Says Sen. Cummins.
Government Cannot Force Men
to Continue Labors.
Wash i ngton , Aug. 30 . Senator
Cummins today in a senate speech
denounced "socalled compulsory arbi
tration" as an impossibility. There is
no power, he said, in which federal or
state governments can force men to
work when they do not want to. This,
he said, would be the case under any
actual compulsory arbitration law.
The fifth and thirteenth amendments
to the constitution, he said, would
prevent operation of such proposed
laws.
"I do not doubt, however," said
Cummins, "that congress- could create!
a tribunal, and confer upon it juris-1
diction to seize upon a controversy be- j
tween a co-operative body of railway ;
workers, such for instance as the'
Brotherhood of Engineers and the1
railway companies, call the parties in
dispute before it, take evidence and
render judgment, assuming of course
that the dispute affects commerce
with foreign nations or among states.
Can't Make Men Work.
"But even this procedure would meet
obstacles, since enforcement of an
award might compel men to work
against their will, which Ls involun
tary servitude. Compulsory arbitra
tion, in the complete sense, is a myth;
an idle dream. It is only possible un
der pure socialism, in which all rela
tions of the human being are deter
mined by the state or in pure mon
archy. "If we are ready to treat the man
who refuses to work or who leaves his
work because he is dissatisfied with
wages or working conditions as we do
criminals or deserting soldiers, then
compulsory arbitration is possible. I
pray we never shall be ready to da
this."
Cummins said there is some of good
in both the Canadian and New Zea
land laws regarding Industrial dis
putes, but that they are not wholly
effective. Similar laws in Massachu
setts and Wisconsin, he believes, are
better. The Erdman and Xewlands
acts, he said both have proved their
value. .

Chicago, Aug. 30. The traveling
public and shippers were warned by
western railroads today to prepare for
a strike Monday. Shippers were no
tified today by a dozen roads running
out of Chicago that perishable freight
that would not arrive at its destination
on or before Saturday would not be
accepted. The Santa Fe has already
issued an order to its agents to refuse
shipments of perishables and livestock
at once.
Other railroads taking as sweeping
action, but setting their time limit
ahead to Saturday for freight deliv
eries, include:
Burlington, Northern Pacific, Rock
Island. Southern Pacific, Missouri,
Kansas & Texas,'St. Louis & San Fran
cisco, Louisville & Nashville, and the
Mobile &. Ohio.
Remaining roads are expected to
take similar action within twenty
four hours. The Southern Pacific
warned all prospective travelers they
might be subjected to "perplexing de
lays after Sunday night." Other rail
roads notified their agents to give the
same warning to travelers..
Notice to Quit Monday.
An order to quit work at 6 a. m.
Monday was given Rock Island em-
ploves at a meeting last night. Engi-
neers. were instructed to quit their j
engines at terminals or, ir that course

them at the first switch. The order
is subject to countermand from Wash
ington before noon Sunday.
A committee of thirteen was ap
pointed at a meeting of middle west
ern manufacturers yesterday to meet
in Washington, Friday morning, to
call on the president and insist that
the brotherhood demands be submit
ted to arbitration.
Railroad terminals were jammed
today. Businessmen rushed to other
cities to close deals so they could get
back before a strike is called. Vaca
tioners were hurrying home. Efforts
were being made today to line up lake
steamers to be used for shipping pro
duce between Michigan points and
Chicago.

RULE IS MODIFIED
Santa Fe Will Accept Only 48-
Hour Shipments.
Acute Situation in This Terri
tory Is Relieyed.
The Santa Fe relieved the acute con
dition in its territory this afternoon by
nodifying its embargo to accept live
stock and perishable freight shipments
that can be delivered to destination in
forty-eight hours from 4 o clock this
afternoon. The order was issued from
the office of J. R. Koontz, general
freight agent. It was flashed from
the general offices here with right of
way over all other messges to agents
and all had been notified ten minutes
after the o rder was mace at 2 o'clock.
Late this afternoon shippers by the
hundreds had wired all railroads who
have declared an embargo oetitioning
lelief.
The original Santa Fe embargo, is
sued late Monday afternoon, refused
acceptance of all livestock and perish
able freight from the time of issuance
regardless of destination.
Under today's modification order a
great amount of shipping -will be
made possible. The ice situation in
small towns will be much relieved. To
peka commission firms will be en
abled to obtain large emergency stocks
from other cities. However, all ship
ments must be in their destinations

tors calling or enforcing a strike on
the lines of the Union Pacific.
Names Garretson Defendant.
Edwin A. Hamilton, a Union Pa
cific conductor for eighteen years, ob
tained the order restraining officials
of the Order of Railway Conductors
from issuing a strike order on the
Union Pacific lines, circulating any
strike order or -spending any money
for strike purposes.
Hearing on the petition for perma
nent injunction was set for September
2. Hamilton named as defendants A.
B. Garretson, president of the order,
and included as defendants the three
divisions of the brotherhood known as
the eastern, southern and" western as
sociations, but the order only is ef
fective in Nebraska, the limit of
Sears's jurisdiction.
As reasons for asking the order
Hamilton in his petition said that up
to July 1, the railroads were regard
ed as separate units in the brother
hoods, but that at that time the rules
were amended and it was provided
that the vote of all should rule the
conductors on each road. He claims
this is illegal because the strike bal
lots were sent out June 15, and that.

Fight Probable Over Two Bills
Proposed by Wilson.
Washington, Aug. 30. The first
formal effort of congress to rush thru
legislation to prevent the strike of
400,000 railroad employes set for Mon
day morning, ended temporarily in a
quarrel today when bitter charges
were made that certain senators are
attempting to make political capital
out of a disastrous situation."
The charges were made by Senator
Robinson, Arkansas. They followed a
statement in committee by Senator
Cummins and other Republicans.
These senators it was stated declared
that since the date has been set and
that a strike appears to be inevitable.
there is no need to rush thru hasty
legislation that might afterwards
prove inadequate to hold for au time
as law.
"The strike i not inevitable," Rob
inson was quoted as saying. "It seems
to me that ot a time like this when
the nation is facing the most disas
trous industrial situation in our his
tory, members of all parties should
stand together, regardless of party or
personal ambitions."
So Stormy Meeting Adjourns.
The meeting grew so stormy that
the committee adjourned the session
after passing a resolution agreeing to
hear the employes, the railroad mana
gers and the shtiifers in the senate
office building tomorrow. Just before
adjournment, however, the committee
decided tentatively to meet again this
afternoon.
The first legislative step on the
floor of either house was taken early
this afternoon when Senator Lewis of
Illinois introduced - two resolutions.
The first was an amendment to the In
terstate commerce act providing for
two additional members or the com
mission and division of proposed nine
members into three sections of three
members each. Each section, under
the amendment, would be assigned to
certain districts, thereby necessitating
repeal of the original act which pro
vides that the commission shall sit
only in the District of Columbia. Ar
rangement is made for joint action by
all three sections "when necessity de
mands." The second resolution provides that
railroads "whenever necessity exists
for increasing wages or readjusting
hours of labor, can apply to tne com
mission for rate increases to meet such
losses."
Both resolutions were referred to
the interstate commerce committee.
Has Herculean Task.
Washington, Aug. 30. Congress to
Jay formally took up the herculean
task of preventing the worst industrial
struggle in history strike of 400,000
employes on 250,000 miles of the
country's 225 railroads, set for Mon
day. There was an air of optimism pres
ent as the senate interstate commerce
committee met to weave President
Wilson's suggestions into legislative
form.
Senate Democratic and Republican
members are unanimous on one point:
the strike must be prevented.
For this reason it was the tentative

CITY AFTER COAL
Topeka Fears for Water Supply

Superintendent Shaw Ordering

If the railroad strike extends murh
longer than thirty days the water sup
ply of Topeka will be cut off. accord
ing to a statement made today by
Jesse Shaw, superintendent of the
water department. This because it
will be impossible for the city to lay
in a slupply of coal sufficient to op
erate the plant for a period to exceed
thirty or forty days.
Mr. Shaw today was busy ordering
all the coal it is possible for the city
to handle in its bins. In addition he
intends to obtain, if possible, more
than the capacity of the bins and place
the surplus along the tracks. He be
lieves he can Kiil sufficient coal to
operate the plant for thirty or forty
days.

Hundreds of Topekans, resigned t
the belief that a general strike of rail

Day, made a run on Topeka erocerv
stores today. Practically all stores of
that kind in the city reported heavy
buying in large orders, of staple good
mostly.
Commission men reported that 7 5
per cent of their business will be de
moralized soon. That per cent of th
commission business here, it is esti
mated, is comprised of shipping per-
' ishable goods.
acon, staple meats, flour, sugar,
canned goods comprised the bulk of
the grocery store sales.
Albert Green of the Green Grocery
store reported exceptionally heavy
buying.
That hundreds of Topekans ar
stocking up against a strike whirl
would cut off the supply of many
kinds kinds of foodstuffs cannot be
disputed," said one groceryman. Th
rush in our store is heavy. We are
making record deliveries.
Prices Are Stationary.
So far the prices of foodstuffs in
Topeka have not risen. Merchants
hope the prices w'.ll not rise and some
go so far as to promise they will not.
However, others fear a rise in several
commodities.
There was no shortage in pertshabl
foodstuffs today but it is believed If
the embargoes of the railroads con
tinue and the strike goes into effect
a shortage in all perishable foodstuffs
as well as a shortage in imperishable
commodities will be unavoidable.
The most serious shortage Topeka
is liable to face, it is pointed out. is
in fresh meats. Packing houses here
are having trouble already with their
shipments but are taking steps to lay .
in a large supply. -
May Cause a Shutdown.
It was said by officials of one com
mission firm that if the strike go into
effect Monday their businesswill prac-t
tically be shut down. Scores of To
pekans out of work will be the result,
A like fate is in store for other firms,
if the strike be carried out because of
inability to get material and fuel.
Hit General Offices,
While officials refuse to comment,
a strike will probably cut down the
force of employes on railroads. Tha
Santa Fe geenral offices would be hit
the hardest.
Some of the first foodstuff shortages
would be in fresh vegetables and fresh
fruits.
"The people will simply have to get
along without a lot of things," said
a groceryman.
