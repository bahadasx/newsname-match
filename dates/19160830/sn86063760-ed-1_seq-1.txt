SOLDIERS LEARN
TRICKS OF TRADE
COAST ARTILLERY IS LEARNING
RAPIDLY IN PRACTICE AT
CHARLESTON.
MANY BUSY DAYS FOR BOYS
Volunteers Who Knew Little of the
Big Guns or War Game Soon Be
come Experts.
Charleston.-A notable feature of
the first annual encampment of the
South Carolina volunteer coast artli.
lery corps, in progress within the
boundaries of the government roer
nation on Sullivan's Island. is the
smoothness and lack of confusion with
which the program of training is pro.
greasing. The percentage of the vol
unteer artillerymen who had even as
much as seen a big gun before this
encampment was undoubtedly small,
as all of them come from a country
where guns larger than squirrel rifles
are as scarce as hen's teeth. And yet
to see them, after only two days of
training, swing one of Uncle Sam's
6-inch rifles into position and load it,
the layman would be inclined to think
they were regulars. Only they and the
regulars instructing them know that
the things they still have to learn are
almost too numerous yet to enumerate.
But this does not detract from the
credit doe them for the progress they
are making with their lessons in coast
defense, the progress oeing the result
of their unflagging willingness and
commendable eagerness to master
the art so many of them have given
up their vacations to learn.
The fact that they soon becoce
efficient enough to "pull the lanyards"
of the big guns and set off a full ser
vice -charge sending a giant projectile
whirring toward a target, with regu
lars looking on only for the purpose
- of seeing that the gun is pointed sea
ward and not toward the island rest
dences of the city and that nothing
goes wrong, is evidence of the prog
ress being made. The fact that the
target will be a stationary one instead
of the moving target fired at by the
regulars will detract little from the
pleasure the privates will take in put
ting a hole through it or the pleasure
that their officers will take in direct
ing the fire and watching for the hit
with field glasses.
"Chumships" between the regulars
and volunteers Is one result of the
encampment so far. They enjoy leave
together, go bathing together and drill
and work side by side. The regu
lars have that admirable tact of over
looking greenhorn etunts, some of
which are laugh provoking, while they
are at all times showing a friendly
feeling for the volunteers. The reg
ulars know the sights on the islands
and in the city and take pleasure in
showing the militia around.
The officers of the fort and the Na
tional Guard officers have found each1
others' company pleasant and there'
.have been calls and return calls and
informal affairs that make the hours
,off duty rounds of solid pleasures. Col.
M. K. Barroll, commandant of the
post, has had all the visiting officers
for his guests on more than one occa
slon, taking them for a harbor excur
-sion, sightseeing trip and later enter
taining them at his home.
Cherokee Cotton Poor.
Gaffney.-Farmers from all sections
of Cherokee county are complaining
about the poor prospect for a cotton.
crop. Large fields of cotton have a
lourishin~g appearance, but a close ex
amination will disclose the fact that
there Is .io fruit on the stalks to speak
of, and many farmers say that it will
make practically .iothing. The only
hope that farmers have is that the
fall will be late, In which case they
may hope for a small yield.
Named as P'ostmaster.
Washington.-At Long Creek, Oco
nee county, Ina Uora Phillips has been
appointed postmaster to succeed L.
Mi. Singleton.
Bennett Retains CommissIon.
Columbia.-George M. Bennett of
Olympia was appointed first lieutenant,
Company G, Second South Carolina
infantry, National Guard of the United
States, and now awaits orders to pro
ceed to El Paso, Texas. Lieut. Ben
nett has been in the National Guard
Sor a number of years and was first
lieutenant of the Columbia Light In
fantry, which is Company G, when the
troops were ordered to mobilize at
Styx. But Lieut. Bennett was turnei
down on the physical examinlation.
Prepare for Boll WeevlU.
Columbia-In a recent Interview
W. W. Long, state farm demonstration
agent, stated that the boll weevil
might reach Anderson county within
the next 12 months. Several days ago
it was announed that Clemson College
will send a commission to the bell 9ee
vil territory in the South to study con
ditions. Gav. Manning will be a mem
ber of the commission. The com
mission will very probably make re
port to the legislature and urge the
passage of such laws to combat the

yond the reach of man, "Girard" writes
in the Philadelphia Ledger.

Why, it seems that on every side of
us there has been something valuable
lying around loose which has millions
in it. An official report shows that
northwestern farmers have been throw
t ing away flax straw every year worth
a sixth as much as their total crop.
I Cottonseed, which a few years ago
was considered a nuisance, has become
so valuable it can be made to liquidate
the entire expenses of producing the
cotten.
Coaltar products derived from coke
-once a total waste-are now worth
more than the coke itself.
From the Geodetic survey I learn
' that 2,000,000 barrels of gasoline can
9 be squeezed from the shale rock of
northwestern Colorado and, if yon
i drive a car, you know Mr. Rockefeller
is not giving away gasoline today.
e Ask President Samuel D. Warriner
about it and he will tell you that the
P Lehigh Navigation company built a
' vast power plant. Why? To convert
coal at the mines which was too small

l tricity, which is shipped by wire
scores of miles, and so does the werk

the difference between success and

WIRELESS OUTFIT FOR ARMY
e United States Soldiers Are to Be Sup
plied With the Latest and Best
d Yet Devised.
e!
a A new set of wireless apparatus
d has been designed for the United
States signal :orps, with a number of
e advantages over any now in use. It
d can be knocked'down and shipped in
, packages, 300 pounds in weight., It
. can be carried on the backs of mules
a or by men if necessary. If shipped
e by railroad it can be packed in a box
e car or on a flat car. If needed for
r emergency use it could either be set
up and operated on a flat -car or in the
box of a large wagon. It is therefore
a well adapted to maneuvers in moun
tainous countries. It is of exception
,f ally high power, being capable of
n transmitting and receiving messages
n within a radius of at least 260 miles;

WAR FROM ITS LIGHTER SSIDE
Newspaper Correspondents Tell i p
morous Stories of incidents in
Which They Have Figured.
The war correspondent's life in
mer days was not wholly made
adventures that called for
had also much of humorous
these episodes will show:
When the British army,
Roberts at its head, was dras
Bloemfontein, and it was
contrary to expectation,
would make no opposition,
prising correspondents, Gi
Reuter's agency and Pa
Sydney Herald, rode ahead i
umn with the object ofbe
to enter.
As they approached BI
the sight of these heralds of
isb power caused such
women and children 1"nd i' t
a couple of bicyclist:, --.. of th
chines and held up their
token of surrender. Preceded
scurrying inhabitants with cries of
"The British are coming!" they en
tered the town with the air of con
querors, and -were received by the
mayor, Landrost, and other adalsm
all tumbling over one another in their
eagerness to be the first to offer their'
submission. And it was by the two' -
correspondents, shaking with internal
laughter, that the rulers of Bloemfon- .
tein were escorted to Lord Roberts''
headquarters, to make their formal r
surrender.
G. W. Steevens was Mr. Gwyie
companion op another occasion, when;
together they were the first to enter
Volo, during the war between Greece
and Turkey, in-1897. So anxious were =
the citizens to capitulate that, at their
request, Mr. Steevens drew up the'
proclamation of surrender, which the
mayor read to the Inhabitants from
the balcony of the town hall; and
when the sultan's troops made their
appearance, it was to learn that the
town had been peacefully "captured
some hours earlier by a couple of .war
correspondents.
cSOUTH AMERICA DOING WELL
Republics Are Regularly Shipping
Vast Amounts of Food to
the Allies.
The financial depression In South
America which followed the outbre -
of the European war has disappeared
and conditions there are improving
daily with the Increase of vest ship- -
ments of supplies to the allies, accord
ing to B. R. Martinez, a piano Im
porter, who returned recently from a
tour of South America, says the -New
SYork Herald.
Exchange rates with Europe on the -
part of Chile, Uruguay and Argentina
are rapidly approaching normal, Mr.
Martinez said, and yast oreditae-bel -
ing added to the account of the vari
cus countries in London and Pgris
for supplies shipped. These supplies,
he added, would go In far greater quan
tity but for the lack of shipping facil
Ities.
"Every vessel which leaves Argen
tina," he said, "carries from 3,000 to
5,000 tons of meat for the European
armies. Chile Is shipping vast quan
tities of copper to thie allies, and Urn
guay is the center for the allied pur
chasing agents who want alfalfa bay
and wheat
The South American countries, Mr. .
Martinez said, are ready to ship to this
country all kinds of raw material for
manufacturing purposes if the ratio of
exchange can be bettered and cash
prices obtained.
Two Questions.
A good story is told by aLverpool
officer back from France. In the rear
of the British lines d, concert was be
ing given for the entertainment of the
*Tommies. Among the contributors
was a soldier who purported to be a
piper, but whose performances In
Ovitably invited a challenge. He was
vigorously hooted by a section of the
audience, and amid the din a raucous
voice rang out: "Send that silly fool
away!" The nkind aspersion, cou
pled with the violence of the language,
moved one of the army chaplains,
who was "running" the concert, to pro
teut. He asked who had insulted the
piper. There was no response. He
persisted: "I want to know who
called the piper a silly fool." A mo
mentary silence was broken when a
burly Irishman rose from his seat and.
said: "And what I want to know is
who called the silly fool a piper!"
Electric Poultices.
A substitute for hot, water bags,
poultices, etc., is a 400-watt incandes
centyap having a carbon filament de
signed to produce much heat and little
light. This lamp Is provided with a
wooden handle and Is inclosed in an
elongated reflector, with a five-inch
opening bringing heat and light rays
to a focus two inches beyond the edge.
The lamp Is connected by an extension
cord to a plug fitting any ordinary
lamp socket. The parts of the body re
ceiving the usual applications are
heated only by convection affecting
the surface, but the lamp heat is trans
mitted by radiation, reaching various
depths in the tissues up to two inches.
Greater healing effect is therefore
claimed.
Urge Use of White Materials.
Spokane (Wash.) laundrymen have
begun to urge their patrons to use
white goods. A printed notice reads
that since the war began many of the
dyes used to color wash goods have,
-proved to be inferior and will not
stand wasging. Red and black dyes
are the colors that "run" the most, ao
cording to the laundrymen.
