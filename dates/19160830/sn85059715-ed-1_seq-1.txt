Floor Space of a Popular and
Successful Store is to Be
About Doubled.
Tim 0rami Leader will soon be in
possession oi one of tlie nicest and
most up-to-<latp ready-to-wear departments
to be found In the city.
The carpenters and decorators are
(asi completing their work which
will about double the lloor space of
this enterprising concern, making in
all about 2,400 witiare feet of floor
space. In this additional door space
will be devoted to a full line of
ladles' and Children's ready-to-wear
garments, including suits and coats,
dresses, furs and shirt waists.
While this has been one of our
leading stores and one of which wo
arc justly proud, it iias never handled
any ready-to-wear apparel. The
pressing demands for tills class of
merchandise made it necessary to
meet the demands of its customers,
for Mr. Fordyco, the genial manager,
is determined to give his customers
what they want and the best he can
procure and sell It to them at the very
lowest prices. In this way he has
built up a trade with a splendid
class of our very bestomers. who
have every" confidence in whatever he
tells them.
J. C. Vost, a very capable man of
many years of practical experience, i
wll have charge of this new department.
while Mr. Fordyco will still!
continue as manager.
From a very modest beginning
four years ago. Mr. Fordyce has
brought this store slowly and surely
to the front until now i? occupies a
very enviable position In the merchandise
world in our city. Mr. Fordyco
Is a firm believer in advertising,
to which he largely attributes the
splendid success it already Is and to
which he says, like one of the great
naval commanders, "I've Just commenced
to fight." Congratulations
