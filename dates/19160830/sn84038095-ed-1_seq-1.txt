THURSDAY WILL
BE SETTLERS'DAY
An Event of Great Pleasure and Inter
est, Will be the Old Settlers'
Picnic Tomorrow.
HON. R. E. FILES THE SPEAKER
Short Review of the Association Tak
en From "History of Crawford
County"—Note Program.
An event of much pleasure and in
terest because of the place it holds in
the hearts of the citizens of Crawford
county is the Old Settler's Picnic
which is to be held for the year 1916
on Thursday of this week. As a part
of the account of the old settler's as
sociation of this county, we find the
following taken from the Crawford
'county Ijistory:
"One of the annual events which is
becoming more interesting and impor
tant with each passing year, is the Old
Settler's picnic held under the aus
pices of the association of that namfc.
These picnics have been the occasion
for much eloquence and fervid oratory
but their chief charm lies in the meet
ing of old friends, the familiar faces
seen again, the grasp of welcoming
hands. No. one who has not lived with
these kindly, capable people for many
years can appreciate them at their
full Value. It is not until one has lived
with them, joyed with them and sorrow
cd with them, yea, not until one has
jrone down into the Valley of the Shad
ow with them and they with him, that
he can really know the people of Craw
ford county for what they are.
"For many the light of other days
is around them, the gaps in the crowd
are filled with shadowy faecs, there
are echoes from inaudible -voices, and
smiles from unseen lips. The ranks
of the pioneers are thinning fast. Very
few remain of all the young, intrepid
men and women who found their
homes in the well nigh trackless wilder
ness of Crawford county a half cen
tury ago. Of the period from 1860 to
1870 their are more but it is only af
ter the third decade of county history
is reached that we find them in con
sirable numbers. The death roll of the
past eleven years speajes eloquently
of the passing of the pioneer. The
fact are that the genuine old settlers
are becoming extinct and: that the
young settlers are becoming old. The
old settlers' picnics have done much to
foster the 19V© of our county, of our
homes ai\fl of each other. The institu
tion is a part 6f the great melting pot
in which German-Americans, Irish
Americans, Swedish-Americans, and
American-Americans lose their hyphen
ated names and become Americans, one
and all."
Before the organization of the Old
Settlers' association, it was the cus­
V',

tom for the citizens of the county to
hold annual toicnics on the fourth of
July and almost every family in the
county was represented at these gath
erings. A Centennial celebration was
held in Deloit 'also and as a part of the
program, Thos. Dobson, who is called
"the first historian of the county" re
lated the experiences and happenings
of the pioneer days.
During the sixteen years since the
organization was instituted most of
the picnics have been hel din Denison,
one or two having been held at Dow
City.
The picnic of 1905 which celebrated
the fiftieth anniversary of the county
was more largely attended than those
of the previous years and we note the
following remark in the Crawford
county history concerning Truma nJ.
Campbell, who is to make a short ad
dress on Thursday: "Truman J. Camp
bell made one of the hits of the day.
He had been assigned the history
from 1885 to 1895 and he responded by
singing an original song which relat
ed the history of the decade assigned
to him." Mr Campbell was the presi
dent of the association for that year.
The programs for the various years
have included many speeches by repre
sentative orators of the state, interest
ing reminiscences of old settlers, the
best of music and since the year 1906,
the baby contest, instituted by Judge
J. P. Qonnor, has been one of the spe
cial features of the picnic. The pro
gram for this year has been planned
with the utipost thought for the enjoy
ment and fun of everyone.
Commencing at 10.30 in the forenoon
there will be sports for the 'boys and
girls, including the yard dash, base
ball throwing, the relay race, and the
apple-passing contest for which a
small prize will be given.
Dinner, one of the main features of
the day, may be enjoyed under the
shade trees and free tea, coffee and
cream will be served as usual.
At 1.30 o'clock, following musical
selections, there will be short talks by
N. H. Brogden and Truman J. Camp
bell, which will be well worth hearing,
The list" of the departed old settlers
will be read by the secretary followed
by the leading address of the day. The
speaker will be Hon. R. N. Files, of
Fort Dodge, who is a recognized ora
tor. We have beeh requested call
attention to the suggestions printed on
the hand program^, that the grounds
be kept as quiet' as possible during
the program hours, especially near the
speaker's stand.
The baby show will precede the bus
iness session and probably will attract
hundreds of people throughout the
couhty. Anp baby is eligible who was
born in Crawford county and who3e
parents were bornin this-county. Many
fond mothers and fathers are planning
to enter their babies in the contest
and it is hoped that there will be so
large number of sweet and happy in
fants gathered together that it will be
a difficult matter for the judges to de-

State University Gets Large Majority
of Students, While Many Will
Atten dDenominational Schools
Denison will be considerably depop
ulated in a short time as during the
next few weeks a very large number
of our young people will be departing
from home to take up their studies,
many of them for the first time, in/ the
various colleges and universities of
the country. The number of young men
and women who will enter college
this fall is larger than that last year,
nineteen of the number being those
who will enter for the first year. The
number last year totaled almost forty
while this year it reaches sixty-four,
including thirty-one' boys and thirty
three girls. As the years go by, it
seems rpore and more 'desirable and
necessary that young people avail
themselves of the opportunity for an
advanced education, and a larger num
ber are determined that they shall re
ceive as many years of schooling as
possible, benefiting themselves by
the many advantages of college life.
The boys and girls of Denison and
vicinity are most fortunate in having
at hand the Denison Normal and Bus
iness College which has proved in
valuable to many. We note that al
most one-half of the students entering
college this, fall have at some time or
other attended the Denison college,
either for the purpose of fitting them
selves for earning a part of their coF
lege expenses or' to take the first
year's work required in college in or
der to enter as a sophomore. We note
also that of the sixty-four almost one
third have been out of school at least
one year before entering college, the
same proportion of the number hav
ing earned a part or all of their finan
ces either at home or after reaching
the college town.
The colleges and universities in
which our city will be represented
during the coming year, number sev
enteen our state schools and especi
ally the state university at Iowa City,
receiving the largest number. A large
number are church schools,

The mere annbuncefrient that the "New Wirthmor Waists are

before that nothing fiuther would need to be iaid about them. But we
want everyone to know about their merits—for we know that when
every wearer of waists learns how good they really are-that our pres

CLASS NUMBERED EIGHTY-SIX
Profs. Humphrey and Van Ness and
Supt. Olry Make Addresses—Rev.
Tourtellot Had Real Message
The arinual rural school eighth grade
graduation exercises were held at the
Germania opera house in Denison on
Saturday afternoon of last week and
as is usually true with all exercises
connected, with the schools tff the
county, both city and rural, there were
very few seats remaining unoccupied
at the opening of the program. With
the motto which appeared on the first
page of the program, "The Aim of Our
Schools: to develop the Heart, the
Head the Hand and the Health," guid
ing the- instructors and the motto of
the class of 1916 "Tomorrow's Suc
cess Depends on Today's Preparation,"
we do not wonder at the size of the
class of graduates this year, nor at
the bright, intelligent and ftappy faces
which appeared .when the i^embers of
the class took their places before the
speaker. Certainly the day is fast ap
roaehing when the pupils of the rural
schools shall hold within their reach
all the opportunities of an education
which are afforded by the city schools

improved, the school houses made
more attractive, and thus every means
01 advancemnt has received attention.
County Superintendent F. N. Olry is
to be heartily commended for the im
provements brought about in the
schools of the county through his ef
forts and as a result of his enthus
iastic interest.
The class of 1916 numbered 86,
about 64 of that number being present
at the graduation exercises on Satur
day. After they had taken their places,
the invocation was pronounced by Rev.
J. L. Boyd, pastor of the Methodist
Episcopal church. The audience was
delighted by a number of harp solos
by Mr. J. V. Barborka, the selections
receiving as usual a hearty apprecia
tion. A vocal selection by Lenihan
Lally followed and was Enthusiasti
cally encored.
The speakers selected by Supt. F.
N. Olry to address the graduates were
choaen for- their, deep iutetestift th$
welfare of the young people, both edu
cational and moral, and because each
of the three, Prof. C. E. Humphrey,
superintendent of the Denison schools,
Prof. W. C. VanNess, president of the
Denison college, and Jtev. J. C. Tour
tellot, pastor of the Presbyterian
church, had a real message and some­

thing worth while to say. The students
were congratulated upon their perse
verance, manifest by the completion
of the eight grade, and also for their,
parents, but for whose inspiration and
encouragement their education might
have been neglected. The idea was ex
pressed that everyone pays for what
he gets and is able to secure what he
pays for, the price being either mater
ial or immaterial. Education, it- was
stated by one of the speakers should
develop the best that is in one, enab
ling him to enjoy life to a fuller ex
tent. It pays in dollars and cents atad
in the understanding gained in life.
Every person has a duty to perform to
hie fellow men and in order to perform
the highest service, one must possess
the needed education and intelligence.
The remarks of the speakers were of
interest and profit and we believe that
every graduate left the exercises with
a greater desire for an advanced educa
tion and a stronger determination to
make the most of his life and his tal
ents.
In presenting the diplomas, Supt.
F. N. Olry also extended to the young
people, his congratulations? and his
hopes, for their future, naming among
the guide posts, ambition, determina
tion and knowledge.
^Following the program, forty-min
utes of educational films ftere shown
as a courtesy of the opera house man
agement and the pictures were very
much enjoyed.
Mrs. A. J. Johnson, who has been
at the home of her daughter, Mrs. E.
P. Sievers of Denison, is reported
quite sick and failing rapidly. She
was taken 'to Denison so that she
might be under the care of her
daughter. As she is well advanced in
age, there is little prospect for her
recovery.
We are pleaesd to learn, that Miss
Grace Schlumberger is to continue her
music class in Denison this winter. Ac
cording to her announcement in this
week's issue she will be in Denison on
Mondays, Ttiesday and Saturdays, re
taining her position with the Mapleton
schools the rest of the week. Denison
is indeed fortunate in having Miss
Schlumberger again take up her music
work here as her talent and ability
place' her among the foremost mu
sicians in this part of the state.

Flushers—Three Present
ACTION UNTIL LATER

Prices Range from.$65 to $1550, Ac
cording to Kind and Make—Con
tract with Flinn Approved
Monday night was dubbed "Flusher
Night" at the city council chamber
and for the most part the evening
was spent in listening to the talks of
different salesmen havink tanks for
sale. Word had gone out that the city*
would probably purchase a flusher and
sprinkler, and there were represent
atives from three different factories
on hand to tell of the superiority of
their machines.
The Studebaker people were on
hand with many photos of sweepers,
sprinklers and flusbers, both air and.
power machines that would throw wa
ter to the top of the highest building
in-the city or tear out the largest block*
of pavement if so desired.
The Economy concern was repre
sented by one of the patentees of the
flusher, and this was the same kind
of a machine that is being used at
Harlan. Shennadoah and many other
places the size of Denison. Being an
air presser the expense of operation
was said to be much less than a gaso
line machine. And an expert Operat
or was not necessary to run it.
The Etnyre flusher, made over at
Oregon, 111., was also represented and
its merits fully exploited. This is a
power machine run by motor and en
gine.
The prices quoted' by the gentle
manly salesmen were.
The Economy air compressor, 650
gallon capacity, flusher and sprinkler,
$650.
The Studebaker power machine,
$1550.
The Studebaker air presser, $1150.
The Etnyre, 675 gallon capacity,
$1300.
The Etnyre, 750 gallon capacity,
$i350.
The council deferred any action in
the matter until some future meeting,
possibly next Monday or Tuesday eve
ning, at which time it is hoped the en-
tire council will be present,
