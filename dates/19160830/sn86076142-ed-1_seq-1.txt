WASHINGTON, August 30 Hear
Admiral Pond, at Sun Domingo City,
cabled the Navy department last
plght that the armored cruiser Mem
phis, swept upon the rocks by a
heavy sea In the harbor there yes
terduy, would be a total loss, and al
though It WttB expected all on board
would be saved, 20 men returning to
the ship from shore leave In a motor
boat bad been drowned.
The message follows: "Terrible
weather In harbor. MemphlB ashore.
Crew being disembarked. More than
20 men lost with motor boat. Castine
safe at sea."
Admiral Benson explained that the
construction of the Memphis Is such
that she probably would withstand a
great amount of pounding, allowing
for rescue of those aboard. He said
he was puzzled over bow the accident
occurred, since officers of the ship
had been warned early of approach
of a tropical storm.
The United States cruiser Memphis
formerly was the armored cruiser
Tennessee. Her name was changed
May 25 last. Recently she has been
doing duty In San Domingo waters In
connection with the revolution. The
Memphis is of 14,500 tons and has a
horsepower of 23,000. Her comple

of the cruiser force of the United
States Atlantic fleet. Captain E. L.
Beach was In command.

was the case. The feeling prevails
that a way, will be found to avert a

Brotherhood leaders, however, re-
Iterated that no power except a satis
factory settlement would avert a
strike.
A" suggestion for Immediate action
on the resolution to provide Investi
gation of the differences of the rail
roads and employes and that a strike
pending a decision be unlawful, has
been considered by the Interstate
commerce committee. fto decision
was reached.

Change of attitude in respect to the

the, negotiations at Washington have

the employes and the president bave
with few exceptions rested In the
hands ' of the executive committees
of the various board of directors,
many of whom are the most Import
ant financiers of the country. One
of them said today that the last word
on the railroad aide had been said.
Congress, It was pointed out,' has
not the power to prevent a strike by
enacting the president's legislation,
but It was strongly hinted that the
railroads might call Into question the
constitutionality of the proposal to
enforce the eight hour day.

stores are well supplied with staples
and none of the owners expresses
the least fear of being unable to meet
an ordinary demand. In the matter
of vegetables, eggs and butter some
difficulty may be experienced in re

may be overcome by resorting to
Jams and Jellies. Tbe supply of can
goods is equal to a normal demand
for a period of 60 days. The stock
of flour will last for the same time.
There is also a good stock of sugar,
but the grocers say this will be

The supply ot gasoline is good for
30 days and one more carload may
arrive before Monday.
Reports from tbe mine state they
are all in excellent shape so far as
