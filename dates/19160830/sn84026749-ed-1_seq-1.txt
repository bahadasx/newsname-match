Santo Domingo City, Santo
Domingo.
Latest advices place the number
of known dead at twenty-one, the
injured at seventy-eight, and the
missing as "several," believed to
have drowned.
ONE IDENTIFIED.
Of the dead only one haa been Iden
tified, G. W. Rudd, chief machinist's
mate.
The other twenty were member of a
(llborty party who were returning to the
Memphis from ahoro leave, when the
motor launch In which they were mak
ing for the crulier was awamped and
capsized by the mountainous waves.
Rudd was a native of Minneapolis, his
next of kin being Mrs. Caroline Ingel
bredtsen, his mother. Ho first enlisted
In the navy June SO, 1903.
Of the Injured, those whose names
have been reporied.vto the Navy De
partment are:
Lieut. Claude A. Jones, U. S. X., en
gineer officer, severely scalded, but will
recover.
Very seriously Injured: H. A. Ander
son, fireman second class; C. II. Wllley,
machinist; A. H. Porter, water tendor;

In addition. Rear Admiral Charles
V. Pond, commanding the cruiser force
of the Atlantic fleet, whose flagship
the Memphis was, he reported that
elxty-seven members of the crew are
slightly Injured: and that several are
missing and undoubtedly drowned.
The Memphis herself Is a total
wreck. Though only thirteen years
old and among the best of the Ameri
can armored cruisers, she was ob
seleto as a class before she was
launched, being slower than the slow
est of any In the British or German
navies.
While the loss is not a serious one
from tho standpoint of the fleet's mili
tary efficiency, she Is the first big
ship lost by the American navy In
years. A board of Inquiry will be ap
. polnte1 at once to determine the re
sponsibility of her commander, Capt.
Kdward L. Beach, for the loss of the
ship. ,

BUT GIVEN NO FINE
Police Escorted Speaker Before
Address Which Caused
Socialist's Arrest.
At tho hearing of Julian Pierce.
Socialist orator. In Police Court today
It developed that Pierce was accom
panied from Socialist headquarters
by policemen to the place where he
gave the public address which re
sulted In his arrest on a charge of
speaking without a permit.
Judge Mullowny, in the District
branch of the Police Court, expressed
surprise that the Police Department
would escort a man to a nlaco where
they were aware the Inw was to be
violated.
Plerco was found guilty of violating
tho pollco regulations prohibiting public
speaking without a license. No penalty
was Imposed by Judge Mullowny. In
stead, attorneys for Pierce were given
tho privilege of making application fqr
a bill of exceptions In order to take
the case to the Court of Appeals. Pierce
did not enter any defense.
Attorney E. Hilton Jackson., his chief
counsel, elected to reserve hla side of
the cusc to present to the higher court.
Major Pullman, head of the police de
partment, who was subpoenaed by
Pierce wns present In court, but did
not testify.
Pierce's attorney's attacked the right
of the. commissioners to issno police reg
ulations governing public speaking.
Their contention was that Congress
alono can legislate for tho District and
that the police powers were limited to
whatever Congress specifically prohib
ited. SYNCOPATED MUSIC

PIERCE HELD GUILTY
CERTAIN, SAY
MUTE IS SHOT
BY WOMAN IN
Gilbert Eriokson, Postoffice De-!
partment Clerk, in Critical
Condition at Garfield. !
HAS BULLET NEAR HEART
Many See Shooting in Front of
Takoma Postoffice Early
This Morning.
While a dozen residents of Ta
koma Park looked on, Mrs. Cora
E. Schuessler, a mute, shot Gilbert
Erickson, another mute, in front
of the town postoffice at 7:30
this morning.
Immediately after the shots had
been fired the woman was taken in
charge by H. L. Thornton, o.ie of
the bystanders, and held until the
arrival of Policeman East on a
motorcycle from the Tenth pre
cinct.
The wounded man started to
jun, butjfell, a few hundred-feet
from the scene of the shooting
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL.
He was taken to Garfield Hospital In
the automobile of Or. A. L. Miller, of
Takoma Park.
At the hospital It was found that
the bullet had entered the back and
lodged near the heart. Physicians
said his condition was critical.
The only inkling of the cause of the
shooting which the police were able'
tn -t from th wnm..n wrm th fni.
to iret from the woman was the fol
lowing statement she signed at tho
police station:
"I shot Ollbert Krlkson. and he ruined
mv homo and mv husband."
The wounded man is nulil to be a clerk
In the auditor's office of the Postoffice
Department. He Is thirty-seven years
old. and has a wife and four children.
He lived In Maple street, a few doors
fiom the home of Mrs. Srhuesttler and
her husband.
I, M. IIIkcIow, a tinner, who employs
Mr. Schuessler. who Is also a mute,
acted as Interpreter between Schuessler
and tho police.
Native of Hodgenville.
Schuessler said that he and his wife
were natives of Hodgenville, Ky. They
moved to this city about a year ago.
Bleelow said he believed the Krlcksons
were also formerly of Hodgenville.
Residents of Takoma Park say the
Erlcksons have been llvlnK there for
about two years.
iJIgelow, who knows the Schucsslers
well, said thut when they first moved
to Washington they took up their home
with the Erlcksons. Sometime ago they
moved a few doors down the same
street.
Neighbors told the police that Mrs.
Schuessler had apparently been worry
ing tor some time.
Uoth families Involved in the affair
are mutes. Erickson, It Is said, can
speak and hear slightly.
According to witnesses Erickson
was coming through the subway un
der the railroad tracks thlB morning,
when Mrs. Schuessler coming down
the railroad tracks .met him. Sh
started talking with her Angers to
him.
Erickson put out his hand and
walked on. The woman followed him,
and as he turned the corner at Bean
and Cedar streets shot him. She was
not more than two yards away at the
time.
The shooting was witnessed by a
number of persons who were waiting
for a .car to take them to Washing
ton. William Steers a newsboy, was
asking Erickson at the time tho shot
was tired If he wanted a paper. He
described the rest of the affair as fol
lows: , "She followed him about the corner,
and I heard a pistol go off, right near
my ear. He threw his hat In the air,
and ran towards Dean's lunchroom.
"She ran after him, with the pistol In
her hand.
Grabbed Her Pistol.
"Then Mr. Thornton grabbed her, and
wrenched the pistol out of her hand.
There was a motorman nearby and she
handed htm a dirty, greasy, little note.
He took It, then she grabbed It back.
"I tried to see what was on It, and
just saw two letters, of the alphabet,
I think. It didn't look like anything
much to me."
Mrs. Erickson, whon seen at her home
by a Times representative, and asked as
to the cause of the trouble, placed her
hand ovre her lips and motioned toher
three sons, so to speak, telling them not
to say anything about It. Then she
wrote "wait." on a piece oi paper.
Nothing could be obtained from her as
to the cause of the trouble.
Coast Artillery to Return.
The twenty-eight companies of coast
artillery which were sent to the border
to act as Infantry before the calling out

M ON DEMANDS
Leaders Deny Strike Postpone
ment Has Been Considered
or Requested.
Asked today If he had been directly
requested to postpone the strike, A. B.
Garretson, head of the trainmen, re
plied, "We havo not," and sjave the
same answer to a question as to wheth
er ho had postponed the strike.
"No power under heaven, short of a
satisfactory settlement by the railroads
can prevent the rallfoad men from
striking on Labor Day," W. B. Lee,
trainmen's leader, said this afternoon
after a talk with Secretary of Labor
Wilson.
Garretson was moro temperate In his
remarks than Lee, but he stated posi
tively that "postponement of the strike
Is not even under consideration."
"Wo have not been asked to defer the
strike, we have not deferred It, and the
question Ib not even under considera
tion," said Garretson.
"Then we can assume that a strike
will occur at T a. m. Eastern time Mon
day unless the railroads met President
Wilson's plan, can we not?'' Garretson
was asked.
Won't Have Red Flag.

Trainmen Now Declare Not Even Passage

Them From Walking Out

SAY ONLY COMPANIES CAN ACT NOW
First Effort in Congress to Force President's
Program Through Ends in Snarl as
Bitter Accusations Are Made
in Senate.
OMAHA, Neb., Aug. 30. District Court
Judge Sean this afternoon issued an order re
straining trainmen employed on the Union Pacific
railroad from striking Labor Day.
The fist formal effort of G"n?ress to rush through
legislation to prevent the strike of 400,000 railroad em
ployes, set for Monday morning, ended temporarily In a
snarl today when bitter charges were made that certain
Senators are "attempting to make political capital out of a
disastrous situation."
Coincident with the beginning of the effort in Congress
to prevent the great strike, came emphatic statements from
representatives of the trainmen that not even the passage
of the measures advocated by the President will be suffi
cient to stop the walkout.
Action to head off the strike must be taken by the rail
roads, the men's leaders say. An eight-hour law by Con
gress merely will mean litigation and delay; an eight-hour
agreement by the railroads will become effective at once.
The men want action now and not litigation, their leaders
say.
EMBARGO ALREADY IN FORCE.
From every section of the country reports come that
the railroads already have placed in effect an embargo on
shipments of perishable freight. Only such freight will be
received as can be delivered before Sunday.
The Pennsylvania Railroad announced this afternoon
that, beginning Saturday, it will suspend all freight traffic
on its lines not only the shipment of perishable goods.
Washington will be hard hit by such an embargo.
Washington's food supplies come largely by rail and the
embargo will mean that no fresh vegetables and other food
supplies will be received here on Sunday and Monday.
This will mean a serious shortage next week. Milk'
comes" largely by motor, but enough comes by train to make
it certain the embargo will curtail the daily supply of milk.
In view of the warlike attitude of both sides, President
Wilson today made strenuous efforts to persuade respon
sible parties to hold off until Congress can act. The repre
sentatives of the men are said to have told him frankly that
under no circumstances will the strike order be revoked
Unless the railroads yield.
ROBINSON'S CHARGES.
The snarl at the Capitol today resulted fro rncharges
made by Senator Robinson, Arkansas. They followed a
statement in committee by Senator Cummins and another
Republican whose name could not be learned. These Sena
tors, it was stated, declared that since the date of the strike
had been set and that a strike appears to be inevitable, there
is no need to rush through hasty legislation that might after
wards prove inadequate to hold for all time as law.
"The strike is not inevitable," Robinson is quoted as
saying. '"It seems to me that at a time like this, when the
nation is facing the most disastrous industrial situation in
our history, members of all parties should stand together,
regardless of party or personal ambition.
ATTEMPT TO FORCE STRIKE.
"I have seen evidences growing during the past two
weeks, and it appears to.have come to a head here, of a de
liberate attempt to bring the strike about for what political
reaction or gain such a catastrophe might cause.
"One thought," he declared, "should be borne in mind;
industrial peace is desired. But notwithstanding our devtfc
