Row in Congress.

Washington, August 30. A formal
effort to rush through legislation to
prevent the general railroad strike
ended temporarily today in a quarrel,
when bitter charges Were made that
certain senators were "attempting to
make political capital out of a disas
trous situation." Senator Robertson
made the charges. They followed a
statement in committee by Senator

need to rush through legislation that
might afterward prove Inadequate.
The committee adjourned after

point when congress formally took up
the last measure calculated to prevent
the worst industrial strike in the his

agreed that the threatened strike cf
400,000 railroad employes must be pre
vented. For this reason it is tentative
ly planned to rush through the senate

tions made by the president which
will achieve this result without beins
subjected to attack and to a resulting
ruinous debate through delay. Thl3
being successful, other suggestions
will be considered later as amend
ments. Recommends Laws.

ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
in the bill recently passed by the
house of representatives and now
awaiting action by the senate; in or
der that the commission may be ena

a promptness and thoroughness w hich
are with its present constitution an J
means of action practically imposr.i
Mo. "Second The establishment of 3'i
eight-hour day as the legal basis, alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employes who are
actually .engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in interstate transporta
tion. Proposed Investigation.
"Third The authorization of ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults In expenses of the sorption of
the eight-hour day in railway transpor
tation alike for the men and for the
railroads; its effects in the matter of
operating costs, in the application of
the existing practices and agreements

practical aspects, with the provision

the earliest possible date, but without
recommendation as to legislative ac
tion, in order that the public may
learn from an unprejudiced source just
what actual developments have en
sued. "Fourth Explicit approval by tho
congress of tho consideration by the
interstate commerce commission of an
increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of tho eight-
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative adjustment and
economies, should the facts disclosed
justify the increase.
Provides Investigation.
"Fifth An amendment of the exist
ing federal statute which provides for
the mediation, conciliation and arbi
tration of such controversies as the
present by adding to it a provision that
In case the methods of accommoda
tion now provided for should fail, a
full public investigation of the merits
of every such dispute shall be institut
ed and completed before a strike or
lockout may lawfully bo attempted.
"And sixth, the lodgement in tho
hands of the executive of the power,
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railways of the coun
try as may be required for military
use, and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe Und efficient
use." , - I

How Cities Will Suffer.
By United Press.
Dallas, Tex., Aug. 30. Water sup
plies, electric light power and electric
railway transportation in every city
in the southwest which is depending
upon coal or other fuel transported by
the railroads, may bo stopped indefi
liiUsly if the threatened nation-wide
railroad strike materializes. Those
cities which are supplied with oil
pumped directly from oil fields will
suffer less seriously. Ice manufactur
ing plants, and cold storage houses op
erated by coal are also threatened.
Grocers say a shortage of foodstuffs,
especially of canned goods, Is probable
if the strike continues longer than a
week. Those stocks are at thoir low
est ebbs as tho fall supply has not yet
arrived. Fresh vegetables will proba
bly be largely supplied by contiguous
territory but most of the fruit coming
from the Pacific coast will bo cut off.

"if you are interested in lower pric
es for gasoline, attend the meeting at
the court house on Monday, September
4 at3 o clock p. m.
Mr. Wright believes that something
can be done whereby the cost of gas
