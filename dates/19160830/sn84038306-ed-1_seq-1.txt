FACTORY TO MASON CITY.
The Manchester Street Sweeper
Company will move to. Mason City
along about the middle of September.
B. W. Grems has spent most of the
Ife,. summer closing the deal and has
completed all arrangements with the
exception of some legal details. A
group of Mason City business men
dna'.ed a $35,000 factory building
equipped with machinery, taking over
stock in the company for payment.
The factory was formerly the Chase
^^Manufacturing Company, which spe
jS§* cialized in gasoline engines and ma
nure spreaders. Forty men will be
employed at the outset.
POLAR LIGHTS VISIBLE.
A beautiful display of the aurora
borealls was witnessed here last Sat
urday evening. The northern sky was
illuminated for hours with shafts and
clouds of light. The long streams of
light flashed across the sky like the
rays from a battery of search lights.
Clouds of light took various forms
and at times filled the whole north
ern sky from the horizon to the zen
ith. Similar displays were visible
in all parts of the middle west. The
disturbance, which is electric in its
origin, was so intense as to severely
interfere with the wires of the tel
egraph companies.

MRS. SK .4 SEVERELY INJURED.
Mrs. E. d. Stiles lies unconscious at
the Lister home south of Manchester,
as the result of a fall from a horse
last Saturday afternoon. She ral
lied from the shock of the aoddent
and on the day following her condition
was normal except that she had not
recovered consciousness. Her con

entire community anxiously awaits the
good news of her complete recovery,
Mrs. Stiles had ridden out Satur
day to the home of her friend Mrs. C.
S. Lister, two miles south of Manches

the accident occurred. She had
mounted her horse but before she
had bceome "firmly seated in the sad

which caused Mrs. Stiles to lose her
balance and fall forward to the

The Democrat in common with her

will be rapid and complete.
LETTER FBOM BORDER.
Below is given several excerpts
from a letter written by an officer in
the regular army to a Manchester
friend. On account of the strictness
of government censors no names are
given:
Marfia, Texas, Aug. 20, 1916.
Dear Friend:
Have just received your letter and
am answering in haste, as we leave
tonight for another point along the
border. I cannot tell you where, as
all troop movements are concealed un
til the last minute arrives. I have
been down here for some time, and of
course have become accustomed to
the climate. It Is not anywhere near
as bad at it Is pictured in some of
the papers up North.
At first the troop I was with was
in a very poor camp, but since the
sanitation corps got to work every
thing is fine and it is much the same
as Iowa. One can close his eyes when
he retires for the night and imagine
readily that he is back in Iowa.
That bunk that some of the militia
men have sent back to various news
papers in Iowa about th? poor qual
ity of the grub is simply rot. Some
of the boys came down here fondly
Imagining they were going on a sum
mer's vacation with unlimited pleas
ure and a hotel menu to order din
ner off of. Of course they got glor
iously foiled but the grub or food
or fodder or whatever you will is all
O. K., believe tne The best part of
it all is, it seems, that those who fared
the lowest at home are the very ones
who raise the loudest wail.
Since encamping here the men have
all made cots for themselves and
this eliminates the bug and insect
pest While necessity forced us to
sleep on the ground in our blankets
the bugs ere very bad, but that is
a thing of the past now, and we are
not troubled at all.
I have talked to several guardsmen
and they say that their one regret is
that they did not bring down a plen
ti ful supply of insectide and carbol
ic acid.
The Mexican situation has raised
the "regs." idea of the National Guard
very highly and militiamen are no
longer looked down upon as they once
were. Of course we do not expect
and did not expect that they ould
step down here and pull off maneuvers
with the same ease as we did, but the
boys sure did themselves proud, and
it would take a very highly trained
eye to distinguish between a regular
and a guardsman now.
I suppose Manchester is much the
same. Of course I have not been
there for several years, but I can
sure see it pretty plain yet. I had a
fine time and your people there are of
the most hospitable I have ever met.
I must close now, as the bugler is
playing the color call, probably the
last that we shall ever hear from
here. You should see the men. I can
didly believe that there is no more up
lifting sight in the world nor none
more patriotic than the lowering of
the national emblem at sunset. The
men at attention, the band rendering
"The Star Spangled Banner" and all
this set upon a stage that cannot be
rivaled for sheer beauty and natural
picturesqueness.
In one hour tents ill be struck
and we will be driving our horses over
the sands of the desert to———. You
know as well as I that is the part
about army life that is hardest to get
used too. One never knows what he
is going to do or where he is going
until he actual order comes to move.
And so goodbye and write. I shall
send you a card as soon as we reach
our destination.
SHOULD USE DIMMERS.
More and more throughout the
state is the hue and cry over the use
of dimmers on automobile headlights
being raised. It is right, too. No one
can drive safely at night with the
glare of brilliant electric lights blind
ing him. Most cars of later years
are equipped with dimmers and they
should be put into use. The manu
facturers did not place them on the
machines for ornamental purposes.
CONTRACTORS BUSY.
Judging from an interview with
several Manchester contractors, this
city is on the crest of a building
wave. Many new houses have been
erected thus far this summer and
many more are in the process of con
struction. Manchester is one of the
prettiest residence towns in the state
any many people are drawn here to
make their home on this account.

(EDITH P. NORTON.)
The first day of our stay at La
Panne, running across the dunes to
ward us, we met one of our boys—
Rene. He hailed us Joyfully. "Fath
er and mother. I am so glad to see
you." Thus Rene was glad to see
us he was on "grande repos" in La
Panne, so had the full benefit of our
•tay there. Every day and night he
•pent with us, usually accompanied
by his friend, the corporal. Several
nights he arrived quite late, but he
explained this defection, "two of the
cooks in the kitchen here are from
my little village," he said, "and they
have so much to do that I pare the
potatoes for them." "Yes, and they
give you a good dinner for your trou
ble," I remarked, which Rene would
not truthfuuly deny.
Rene was most anxious for us to
visit his particular villa, where he
and twenty-five others were quarter
ed. So one day we arrived unan
nounced. Wfc&t we saw was a shell
of a house, with all the partitions
knocked out, and the boards covered
with straw. Here most of the twenty
ix were gathered. Some sleeping,
some repairing their clothing, others
playing games, a group among" whom
was Pierre, busy with the manufac
ture of rings. Rene met us and
proudly showed us to his particular
corner. "Mother, would you like to
try some of our bread?" be politely
asked. I had heard much of their sour
Joffre" bread, so was willing to make
the experiment. Rene disappeared,
and soon returned with two wafer like
sli ces, spread with bacon grease (the
soldiers' most common substitute for
butter). "Why Rene, it's not at all
bad." I could truthfully say this. I
was shown a feast which a soldier had
prepared for himself and a boon com
rade, a round pen filled with sparrows
quite nicely cleaned and dressed and
prepared for roasting. "Hq has a trap
and catches. I
was informed.
Then I had a happy thought. With
a soldier friend I disappeared from
the villa. In about fifteen minutes
we were back. Eager eyes regarded
the packages as they were opened.
There was raisin bread, four pounds
of real butter, cakes, chocolate, jam
and golden syrup. The bread was cut,
buttered and handed out, as were the
cakes and chocolate. But Rene gave
it as his opinion that the jam -and
syrup should be reserved for the fol
lowing morning.
That night Rene paid us his accus
tom ed visit. "Rene," I said to him,
"how about that jam and syrup? It
wouldn't surprise me at all it the
other boys would find it a nd eat it
all while you are away tonight." "Oh
mother, I have seen to all that," he
ans wered earnestly, "I have left
Pierre standing guard over it!"
The next day I asked Rene how he
and his friends had enjoyed the
sweets. Rene chuckled, "We had each
of us, six or eight slices apiece," he
confessed, "and ate up our ration of
bread or the whole day!"
It was a proud Rene, when one day
when with him he encountered his
friend and officer, the Count. The in
troduction was of the most informal,
but we all entered into the spirit of
the occasion and not the least de
lighted with the encounter was the
Count. "But I am afraid the bad boy
spends so much time with you that
he doesnn't keep me clean," he laugh
ingly said to us (Rene was doing or
derly duty for him). "Yes, and I get
back to my quarters so late at night,
that I give him an hour more of sleep
Ip the morning," Rene added.
I am afraid what made Rene late
to his quarters one night was a dif
ferena affair. He could scarcely tell
me about it for laughing. He and
Corporal Franssen, crossing the dunes
in the darkness, the night before had
found an officer ahead of them trying
to find his way by means of a tiny
flashlight Just then a stray horse
happened by, following a leisurely
course in the darkness. For the next
fifteen minutes these two chased the
horse upon the hapless officer, and
each time he would turn to investi
gate with his tiny light, they would be
convulsed with silent spasms of mirth.
But Rene was only the forerunner
of many of our soldier guests. It be
came highly exciting as the days pass
ed by, to hear the heavy footsteps of
approaching soldier feet, as they drew
near oyr door, and ad the knock fell
upon our door, to say to each other,
"I wonder which one it is?"
One of the earliest to arrive was
Jean. His beaming face as he assured
us he could pass two whole days with
his beloved "Pere and Petite Maman,"
we shall never forget. He showed us
proudly his authorisation, granting
him permission to visit his "parents"
during two days, at La Panne. "Your
little Jean is highly esteemed by his
officers," he confided to us. How high
ly, we were to learn later.
Then early one aternoon came a
rap at our door, and entered Louis.
When our greetings were past, we
said, "What is that you have on your

back?" He relieved himself carefully
of his burden, and laid it reverently on
the bed. It is a "souronne" (a bead
wreath) for a comrade's grave," he
said simply. We gifted it. It was very
heavy. "And yott have carried it all
the way?" we asked, for he had told
us that he had come all the way from
his station in France, thirty five miles
distant, on his bicycle, that day. ''But
certainly," came his answer. He was
bringing it to lay upon the grave of
a comrade buried near La Panne. "We
cyclists always do this for one of our
number who is killed," he explained.
"But I am sure it must have cost you
very much," I could not resist re
marking. "Oh it is not a very good
one, It only coat sixty francs ho

about 120 men had paid for it, and

Joseph put in an early appearance.
He was stationed quite near, at Bray
dunes. I am afraip he did not have
permission each tii*e he came. "It is
quite easy to dodgp the Gendarmes,"
he assured us. Wte did not encourage
him in his insubordination, but could
not help but be ^mused at the ac
counts he gave of lgs narrow escapes.
Remy looking a different boy than
the wan prisoner of war, newly es
caped, vjfchad first met at London
also caxfti{n#pend a night with us.
And on the
"fast day of our stay our
little Pierre, "the first of the flock,"
arrived. In all about fifty soldiers
whom we had known visited us, some
times we sat down to dinner twelve
strong. In our little room after din
ner, often there were a dozen soldier
guests sitting on beds and on the
floor, while reminiscences were ex
changed and exciting experiences re
lated. One of our guests told us how
he won the highest order in the Bel
gian army, the "Chevalier del'ordre
de Leopold," capturftg go output
from the enemy almost single hand,
§d another told us of capturing a
batch of German prisoners, and cor
poral told how Kane-kept from going
to morning drill, which he detested,
by the simple expedient of rubbing his
tongue on the whitewash of his villa,
and then .submitting said "diseased"
member to the army doctor. "And it
worked," added the corporal, "while
I have never been able to be excused
from, duty, when I was really so ill
I could scarcely stand."
Happy days for us, was that fort
night in La Panne, happy too we be
lieve they were for our soldiers, me
morable for us all.

SCHOOLS OPEN NEXT MONDAY.
Manchester Schools are Rapidly Com­
ing to the Front.
The Manchester public schools open
for the year's work next Monday. It
is probable that more students will
take advantage of the .facilities of
fered than ever before. Of late years
local educational institutions have
come rapidly to the front and stu
dents from all over the county now
take their school work here.
Last year the schools were somewhat
congested and it became necessary to
put in an extra grade. New schools
have been erected now however and
this fault is remedied.
J. S. Hilliard, the new supreinten
dent has secured the services of an
exceptional group of teachers, and
parents can res tassured that their
children will be in the hands of thor
oughly competent Instructors. Mr.
illiard came here very highly rec
ommended for efficiency, and as he has
devoted his whole life to school work
it is assured that the Manchester
schools will progress as never be
fore. Mr. Hililard belongs to the new
class of educators who believe in
keeping abreast of the times and not
dropping into the "old fogy" class.
This fact will mean much to those
who contemplate work in the local
schools as it means they will be un
der the supervision of a man who un
derstands education from every stand
point and who will be quick to realize
the standpoint of the youthful mind.
FORD TURNS OVER.
While riding around in his Ford car
Sunday afternoon. Oba Lyman had
the misfortune to let the steering gear
slip out of his hands and the result
was that the machine performed a
few evolutions not of the most staid
type. The accident occurred a few
miles north of the city as Mr. Ly
man was hurrying home to don a clean
collar. One of the front wheels of
the machine was broken in the catas
trophe and Oba's wrist was so badly
sprained that he carries it in a, sling.
A SLIGHT RAIN.
A slight rain fell about the'county
early Saturday morning but it was
not sufficient to help crops to any ex
tent. Corn seems badly burnt in this
section, more so than in any other
portion of the state, although none of
it has escaped the ravages of ex
cessive heat.

JUBILEE WEEK
BIGGEST EVER
WILL SURPASS EVERY CELEBRA
TION OF KIND EVER HELD
IN THIS VICINITY.
FXPECT ENORMOUS
CIOVOS
The Biggest Amusement Propositi**
Ever Attempted in Com
ty History.
With the opening day of the big
Manchester Jubilee, which will last
for three days, Delaware county will
see the biggest celebration ever held
within its precincts. No expense has
been spared to make the entertain"
ment successful and it is expected that
a bigger crowd will throng into Man
Chester than ever before.
The biggest attraction secttred thus
far is the "pattle Cry of Peace." om
of the largest and best photo plays ev
er produced and said to rival "111*
Birth of a Nation." The drama .'a
itself is considered the most stirring
appeal for world wide peace ever
staged and in its cast are many rata
ble actors.
vje
There will be some very unusual'./i}1
aerial acts and also a troupe of train-?
ed animals, considered the best on
road at the present time.
Horse racing will be a big feature
of the three days and there will al-^
so be three first class ball games be
tween evenly matched teams.
At ten o'clock in the morning there
will be a stock show which is open
to all. Many prominent Delaware
county breeders have entered the best
specimens that their barns and sta
bles offer.
Outside of the above a twenty ear
carnival will exhibit all during the
three days and as this is one of the?
largest caravans on the road, is mean*
that Manchester is going to have some
celebration.
The jubilee is in reality the out*
gr owth of the old Delaware county
fair, but it is in the hands of the Com
mercial club, and will be a 'de
cided success. It takes the place of'
the fair, but is far larger and far bet
ter than that celebration ever was.
In 1893 Mr. Hahesy was united in
marriage with Miss Johanna Penny,
who died on the home farm in the fall
of 1911. Mr. Hahesy is survived by
the following children: Katherine,
May, Willie, Margaret, Agnes, Mary,
John, Edward, Thomas and Irene. He
also leaves to mourn his death three
brothers, Patrick Haliesy of Monti
John Hahesy of Colfax, and Edward
Hahesy of Minatare, Nebraska.
The sympathy of many friends is
extended the bereaved children in this
time of sorrow.
WILL SAIL FOR LONDON SEPT. ft
Mrs. Ralph Norton, who has been
spending a few weeks in the United
States, will sail on September 9th, for
London, to resume her work among
the soldiers. During the brief time
she was in the States she visited her
mother in this city, and many cities
of the east, delivering addresses to
large assemblies at Moody Bible In
stitute in Chicago, New Willington,
Pa., Mountain Lake, Maryland, Wino
na Lake, Indiana, and Pittsburg, Pa.
Receiving one hundred and forty let
ters in one day from the Belgian sol
diers in thq trenches and in hospitals
is unmistakable evidence of the fact
that the work which Mrs. Norton and
her husband have been doing is ap
preciated by the boys. Mrs. Norton
will sail on the steamer Philadelphia..
We wish her a safe journey,
