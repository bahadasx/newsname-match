little of the corn will ripen, in the
opinion of Mr. Thorpe.
Northern grown seed will be keenly
in demand for the 1917 planting. Mr.
Thorpe has made a special study of
corn culture for over twenty years,
having developed varieties which have

BELIEVED BIG STRIKE CANNOT BE AVERTED
Mercedes Man Says Everyone
Used to Carry Pistols in
Old Days.
THIEVES WOULD CARRY
BOOTY ACROSS LINE
Tricky, the Greasers for Years
Have Preyed on the Am.
ericans.
By Ewing Lewis.
Mercedes, Tex.—The Texan does
not consider the Mexican an humble
imigrant timidly stepping under the
shadow and protection of the STARS
and STRIPES. F?r many yfears, and
unffil Recently* the. Mexicans along
this side of the Rio Grande controlled
county politics, say the Americans
here,and for -tricks that were dark,
they had 'boss rule in Chicago beaten
in forty ways. It was always fairly
easy for a Mexican who committed
a crime to flee across the Rio Grande
between^ the time Diaz'
—that
power waned and this- time the United
States government filled the border
with soldiers. But the Mexican often
did not go to the trouble of fleeing.
With men of his own blood in con­
trol of American counties on the bor­
der, he calmly defied the statutes.
Some of the rich Mexican ranch­
men improved on the method that
the land owners used in 'Mexico at
election time. Acrpe^ the line the
land ownjpr voted b?$£»."• ins solid for
the candidate of his ciidice. On this
side he paid poll taxes for hundreds
of imaginary citizens of his neighbor­
hood, the Texas say, and brought vot­
ers and repeaters from across the
.Roi Grande for election day.
Wild Days Passing
"Until lately," a 'Mercedes business
man told me yesterday, "everyone
here protected his own property the
best he could with his own right arm
and his own pistol linger. You could
ride all day and meet no man who did
not carry a revolver at his side. If
you left a horse tethered outside at
night, you were lucky to find the
horse in the morning. If the animal
was not stolen the chances were that
the rope was, and you had to spend
a day chasing the animal. If proper­
ty was stolen and taken across the
border you had little chance of re­
covering it. Even if the thief were
caught, there were long delays. A
saddle was stolen from me, and 'by
hard work I had the thief caught in
three days just across the river. But
it was eight months before I could re­
cover the saddle. The men had to
be proven guilty before I could re­
cover my property and it took eight
months to convict him.
"For years the Mexicans had the
whip hand along this side of the river
and controlled most of the county of­
fices. The plan of Sandiago was not
a joke. The 'Mexicans did greatly
outnumber the Americans, and for a
good while it was pretty much like
living in Mexico here.
Mexicans Hard to Understand
"It is hard for the northerner to
understand the 'Mexican. I don't
understand him myself, and I've lived
on the border forty years. A Mexican
may apparently be trustworthy for
years, and then prove a traitor to the
flag he is living under. There was a
Mexican on the ranch adjoining my
father's, whom we thought to be as
good as they make them. In five
years he never left the place except
to go to town for an hour 'or two.
My father took him on our ranch
and he lived with us three years. We
often trusted him with several hun­
dred dollars, and he was scrupulously
honest. He spent all his evenings,
as far as we knew, playing a cornet
about a year ago we learned that he
had 'been a ringleader for years in
plots against Americans. You cah
not dismiss the matter by declaring
that there are some good Mexicans
and some bad ones. The ones who
are noticably 'good,' and fine work­
men, are sometimes the most danger­
ous."
Guard Likes Them
J. O. White, river guard and a
veteran of the border, finds lots of
good in the Mexicans of Hidalgo
county. A good many Texans will
tell you that the poor Mexicans was
ruined by prosperity when the men
from the north came down and paid
him five times as much as he bad
been working for. Used to working
for about seventeen cents a day,
American money, he was paid a dol­
lar a day, and one day's work gave
him enough to live on for a week—or
to stay drunk two or three days. He
had no desire, they tell you to get
ahead, if he had a dollar in hift

FOR RED TRAIL
A large new ferry 'boat, one that
will accommodate ten automobiles at
one trip, will arrive here tomorrow

attorney general for the M., K. & T.
railroad, and M. J. iMcKnight, all res­
idents of Parsons, Kan., remained in

they feared would tie them up far
from home for a considerable length
of time.

tice of claims was served upon at­
torneys of the Midland Railroad com­
pany for consequential damages to

Of WW
R. R. Officials Inaugurated Plans
to Fortify Themselves If
Strike Is Called.
WILL PLACE EMBARGO
ON PERISHABLE GOODS
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 29.—Fortify­
ing themselves against the most crit­
ical conditions that may arise dur­
ing the strike of brotherhood men,
officials of the Great Northern rail­
road today, for the first time, inaug­
urated plans for placing an embargo
on consignments of perishable freight
and livestock and an order refusing
such consignments will probably go
out to the local agents tomorrow.
The Northern Pacific and Omaha
roads have not yet prepared such or­
ders, but officials of these two lines
said toniifht that such action will
probably be taken shortly, unless
promise of an amicable adjustment
of the controversy becomes apparent
tomorrow. Omaha officials said they
would not be called upon to act with
so much haste as some of the trans­
continental lines, but that they would
protect themselves and shippers.
The Great Northern officials, ac­
cording to J. iM. Gruber, vice presi­
dent in charge of traffic, said tonight
would probably authorize such- an
order tomorrow. It will cover all per­
ishable freight and livestock and af­
ter tomorrow no consignments of
freight of a perishable nature or live­
stock will be received. Following
this, an order to receive freight of
any character only at the shippers'
risk will be issued, he said.

Brotherhood Heads at Logger
Heads as to Whether Strike
Can Be Averted.
RAIL HEADS FAVOR
PRESIDENT'S PLAN
Wilson Lays the Situation Before
Congress With Important
Recommendation.
Washington, Aug. 29.—President
Wilson, laying the railway strike situ­
ation before congress today, with itr
commendations for legislation,, ad*
vanced the crisis to a stage where the
next developments depend on two
points. They are:
Whether the legislation he proposes
can be passed.
If enacted, will it be effective to
prevent a strike already called (or
7 a. m. September 4.?
'Neither ot these questions can be
answered tonight.
The brotherhood heads themaelvfe*.
aitifounctog their intention to,
certain ((ortknij- of 'fh#'
points, are at logger's heeds
whether its enactment iroKld'prevent
the strike.
The railroad presidents, favorable
to the president's plan in thermal!!,
think it would make it difficult for the
strike to begin.
Efforts for Settlement Continue.
Meanwhile, although negotiations
between the employers and men were
broken off today by the rejection of
the railroad presidents' latest pro­
posals for arbitration, President WU*
son is continuing his. efforts to bring
the two sides together on some form
of agreement. Efforts, which might
well be described as almost super*
human, are being exerted to that end
tonight.
Proposed Plan of Legislation.
When the brotherhood leaders this
morning rejected the latest proposals
of the railroads and definitely set the
strike for Labor Day, without further
notice, President Wilson decided to
lay the whole situation before con*
gress. Before a joint session of the
house and senate and with a solemn
recital of the distress a disastrous
strike would bring to the country, the
president proposed a plan of leglsla*
tion. This is his proposal in his own
language:
First, an Immediate provision for
the enlargement and admistrative re*
organization of the Interstate Com*
merce commission, along the lines em*
bodied in the bill recently pasted by
the house of representatives and now
awaiting action by the senate in or*
der that the commission may be en*
abled to deal with the many great and
various duties now devolving upon It
with a promptness and thoroughness,
which are with its present eonetltu*
tion and means of action practically
impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ*
ment of all railway employee who are
actually engaged in the work of oper*
atin? trains in interstate transpoHa
tiou.
Third, the authorisation of the ep»
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re*
suits in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day In railway trans­
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads: its effect in the matter
of operating costs, in the application
of the existing practices and agree­
ments to the new conditions and In
all other practical aspects, with thn
provision that the investigators
report their conclusions to the
gress at the earliest possible date,
without recommendations as to
lative action in order that the
may learn from an wprefnileot
source just what actual developments
have ensued.
Fourth, explicit approval by eon*
gress of the consideration by the In*
terstate Commerce coaunissian of an
increase of freight rates to meet.eacfc
an additional expeaditurae by the vail*
roads as may have beea rsndsiel by
the adoption of the eight hot day aai
which have not been oCket by adhria*
