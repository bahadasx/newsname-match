Supt. E. M. Mitcrell Announces
Opening.Splendid Corps
of Teachers.
The Warren schools will open for
work this year Sept. 11th. This is
.a week later than has been custom
ary but this was thot best in order
that the new school building may be
-more nearly in readiness for work.
There will be no change as to the
location of grades except the 3rd
-and 4th grades in the high school
.building will be directly above where
they have been heretofore. If the
high school building is not ready by
the 11th, the North Star college has
kindly consented to allow the high
.school to use its building for a short
time. The Normal department will
be located the Washington build
ing as it has been for the past few
years. This department promises to
be large this year. For this reason
all expecting to take this work and
Jiave not already registered should
write Mr. Mitchell at once. Only
those who have earned 12 high
school credits are permitted to take
work in this department, and those
who do take work therein must
spend all their time upon this work,
r- exclusive of other'high school work.
After this year, only full high
school graduates may take the Nor
mal work, unless these desiring it
bave had 16 month's experience as
teachers.
Any pupil residing in our asso
ciated districts may attend school at
Warren free of all tuition. Students
residing anywhere in the state may
attend our 7th and 8th grades or
the high school without paying any
tuition. Tuition for such pupils is
collected directly as state aid.
Those attending grades below the
7th are charged $1.00 per month,
payable in advance by their parents
or guardians. This does not apply
to pupils from associated districts.
Let all so plan their work so that
they may begin school at the**-,very
beginning. Many who fail to do this
get behind with their work and be
come discouraged. Moreover our
teachers have sufficient work and
cannot devote a great deal of extra
time to those who come in late un
less there is a very good reason.
Especially is it absolutely necessary
for all expecting to begin high
school work, to start on time.
Those desiring to have a high
school girl to work for room or
board or both should notify the sup
erintendent of schools. There are
always a number of girls who wish
to do this and some of them are
ver capable.
Judging form inquiries coming in
regarding entrance requirements to
the high school, the attendance this
year will be a record breaker.
Those coming from the country
districts may enter the high school
on a diploma from the county super
intendent certifying that they have
completed the work of the first eight
grades. Those not having a diploma
must present high school board cer
tificates in at least three of the fol
lowing, arithmetic, grammar, geo
graphy and United States history.!
We make this same requirement of
those from our own 8th grade.
The high school will be housed
this year in one of the best buildings
of the state. Conditions will be
imewhat unsettled the first month
due to moving into the new building
Jbut when once fully settled the op
portunities for good work will be
unsurpassed.
Following is a list of the teachers
elected for the coming school year.

With ihe added conveniences and

MAYOR RALPH B. TARALSETH
JOINS THE BENEDICTS.
Ralph Barney Taralseth, of War
ren, and Lottie May Olson, of
Argyle, were quietly married at
Minneapolis, Minn., on Wednesday,
Aug. 23, 1916. This is the simple
announcement of the happy event
that unites for life Warren's popular
mayor and one of Argyle's most
esteemed young ladies.
The bride is a daughter of Mrs.
Jennie Olson, whose late husband
was one of the pioneer merchants of
Argyle. She is a talented and high
ly accomplished young woman,
whose coming to Warren will be
greatly welcomed by all the people
of the city. For some years she ser
ved as a teacher in our public
schools, hence she is no stranger
when she comes to reign as queen in
her own home.
The groom as everyone knows is
the head and manager of the K. J.
Taralseth Company, which operates
Warren's and the whole Northwest's,
biggest general merchandise store, a
business enterprise that was founded
by his father, K. J. Taralseth, War
ren's pioneer merchant prince,
whose genius for business the son
has inherited to a marked degree.
As before stated, the groom is also
the mayor of Warren, the city in
which all his interests are now locat
ed and henceforth
Till reesSve^1*
his
undivided attention. It may be
taken for granted that the city of
Warren will be better governed than
ever now, since the honorable Mayor
has taken unto himself a better half.
A host of friends of both bride
and groom in this city and county
and thruout the entire Northwest ex
tend to them most hearty congratu
lations and wish them a full measure
of joy, happiness and success in their
journey thru life.
The newly wedded pair will be at
home to their friends in Warren af
ter October first.
AUTOMOBILE TIPS OVER.
An automobile accident that might
rave proved fatal to several occurred
on Monday forenoon a "out t%o
miles sou. I of Warren en thro
C^ooktton toad. Mr. and Mrs. .J.
Meloney and Mr. and Mrs. Can
Sandsten, and little son of Wil'iam?,
Minn, had left Stephen where they
are visiting relatives and friends,
and were bound for Crookston, in a
new Studebaker car. In passing a
team on one side of the road and
dodging a man that was standing
on the other side of the road a little
further on, the car got too close to
the edge of a culvert, hidden in tall
weeds, a few feet ahead. Fortunate
ly the car was running at a slow
rate of speed and just tipped over
gently on the side, none of the oc
cupants of the car being injured at
all. The accident happened just as
the north- bound local passed by and
the train crew told about the acci
dent. In a little while a number of
cars from town were on their way
to the scene of the accident. The
automobile was soon righted and
brought back onto the road appar
ently uninjured except the running
board on one side, which was badly
smashed. The auto party was soon
on their way again after a mishap
which might have been serious.
The culvert at which the accident
occurred is in Folk county, a short
distance south of the Marshall coun
ty line. Like most culverts that are
put in, it is too short, and ought
never to have been left without
guide rails on either side. The tall
weeds that grew on both sides hid it
completely from view. It is strange
that cars have not before this gone
over the edge. The danger to auto
mobile tourists from too short or de
fective culverts, is a serious one and
township and county road authorities
should not neglect taking proper
steps to safe^guard same. It may
save an expensive damage suit.

BARREN SHEA
RAISE WHEAT
DESPITE RUST
North Dakota Farmer Grows New
Strain of Wheat that
Resists Rust.
Red and black rust soon will have
few terrors for the farmers of the
northwest, as the result of a strain
of hard wheat being grown success
fully in Stutsman county, N. D.,
this season which is immune to rust
like the strain of flax which is im
mune to wilt. It is known as rust
resistant wheat and the kernels pro
duced from its cultivation this sea
son seemingly burst with gluten.
Several farmers have grown a
rust resistant wheat this season and
will secure big yields from their
harvested fields. Before harvest the
grain stood bright, free and clear of
all rust, while the heads were full
and heavy. Last year the crop was
better, the weather conditions being
more favorable, and a yield of thir
ty-five bushels or better of splendid
kernels was secured. The aggregate
acreage this season is sufficient to
provide a considerable quantity of
seed for next season.

DAne
PIONEER FARMER OF
KITTSON COUNTY COMMITS
SUICIDE BY DROWNING.
Hallock, Minn., Aug. 28.Olaf
Johnson, a pioneer farmer and
prominent capitalist of Hallock com
mitted sucide by drowning in the
soath banch of two rivers near here
ea^ly to-day.
Ar. Johnson left his home shortly
after 3 a. m. Several hours later
membeis of his family missed him.
Three hundred citizens in posses
of 12 scored the country side and
dragged the river. At 6 p. m. the
bo ly was recovered.
It is believed that worry over fail
ure of the crop on his 800 acre farm
caused Mr. Johnson's mind to be
come unbalanced.
Mr. Johnson was not financially
ruined as a result of the losses sus
tained this year accoiding to reports
from Hallock but would have a fair
balance on the right side when all
was cleaned up, but it is feared that
brooding over his losses caused him
to lose his mind for the time being.
He is estimated to be the wealthiest
farmers in Kittson county.
OLSON ELECTRIC AWARDED
HOLT CONTRACT.
Yesterday H. J. Olson, of Warren,
was awarded the contract to install
an electric light and power plant in
the village of Holt. There were
numerous bidders, some of them
from the twin cities, but Mr. Olson's
bid was by far the lowest. The con
tract calls for one 29 W Triumph
dynamo 110-125 V. D. C. 850 R.
M. complete with base, pully and
field rheostat. Poles, line wires and
streets lights are included Mr.
Olson's contract. Mr. Olson is a
capable electrician and does honest
and reliable work, that in itself is a
good recommendation. The plants
he has already installed in several
villages in the valley are giving ex
cellent satisfaction.
Aged Pioneer Woman Passes Away.
Mrs. Carrie Erickson died at
the home of her daughter, M"s. Cirl
E. Allen, in this chy, on Sunday af
ternoon,* Aug. 27,' 1916, at 4-So
o'clock, aged 78 yaa^s.

Liarried there in 1S62. Witn her
1 ut band and family she emigrated to
America 1882, and settled 01 a
farm in town of Comstock, this
county. Here they lived until four
years ago when they moved to the
village of Viking. The husband
passed away on Jan. 2, this year and
the aged wife, who had been his
faithful and loving companion in a
long married life, was soon to follow
him. About six months ago she
came to live with her daughter, Mrs.
Carl E. Allen, in this city, but her
advanced years with their accom
panying ailments coupled with the
loneliness she felt on account of the
husband's death, soon ended the life
of a good industrious pioneer
woman. Two sons, Erick and Daniel,
passed away a number of years ago.
One son, Andrew Erickson, of
Viking, and a daughter, Mrs. Carl
E. Allen, of this eity and her hus

mourners. Deceased is also mourned
by many friends among the old set
tiers in the community where she
had spent her active and busy life
She was honored and esteemed by
all who knew her genial nature and
kindliness of heart.
The funeral was held from the
Allen home on Monday afternoon at
two o'clock and was conducted by
Rev. Werner Drotts of Viking.
Many old neighbors and friends
were present and escorted the re
mains to the final resting placet in
Greenwood cemetery. Mother has
found peace and rest.
The sympathy of the community
is extended to all who mourn her
departure.

NOTABLE SEASON
FOR BUILDING
Nearly $150,000 Spent Fa* Improve
ments in This City During
Past Summer.
The summer of 1916 in this city
has beer veiy notable for the un
usaal activity in building and im
provement lines. It is estimated
that approximately $150,000 will
have been spent by the time all the
buildings and improvements now un
der construction have been com
pleted.
The new $50,000 school building is
the most important bailding to be
erected this year. Then new $35,009
hotel .aucture is anotner important
building project. Then there is Fred
t*v.'iison's new store i 14 on
Main street, which is a splond i im
provement for the city. No le?s
than 15 new residences have been
completed or are under construction.
Placing their average cost as $2,000
will make $30,000 for new residences
alone. Other improvements in the
residence sections have been made
to the extent of over $15,000. Im
provements such as sidewalks, street
crossings, sewer and water exten
sions will probably amount to near
ly $10,000. This totals $150,000 and
places this city among the leaders in
city improvements in the northern
part of the state.
POSTAGE STAMP ISSUE
172 BILLION SINCE 1847.
Approximately 172,000,000,000
postage stamps have been issued by
the United States since they first
were .placed on sale at New York,
July 1, 1847. Issuance passed the
billion a year mark in 1882,
two billion in 1890, three billion in
1896, four billion in 1901, five billion
in 1902, six, seven, eight, nine and
ten billion in 1906. 1907, 1909, 1910,
1911 respectively, and 11 billion in
1914. Last year the exact number
of ordinary stamps was 11,226,386,-
415, and of stamped envelopes and
wrappers 1,793^,766,296 were ^ssued.
New Indian Lid Decision.
The Government Indian Depart
ment at Washington has made two
important annoucements in connec
tion with the enforcement of the
Indian treaties which prohibit the
liquor traffic in northern Minnesota.
One is to the effect that the posses
sion of liquor is prima facie evi
dence of its introduction. The other
declares that beer is to be classed
as a spirituous liquor.
This latest activity on the part of
the government closely follows a
visit made by W. G. Calderwood,
Minnesota's leading prohibitionist,
to Washington a week or so
i
i
S i
N
Calderwood was again called to
Washington on August 22nd and
was in conference with government
officials from time to time this
week.
The Indian treaty provides that
liquor shall not be introduced into
the restricted territory and hereto
fore it has been necessary to prove
the specific act of introduction. In
other words, if a man were found
with liquor in his possession, noth
ing could be definitely proved that
he introduced it. Under the new
ruling, if a man has liquor, the fact
that he introduced it need not be
proved. That, under this new order,
is assumed.
The second announcement is of
importance because it covers the
only wet territory remaining in
northwestern Minnesota. All of
that section of the state is dry
either by Indian treaty or local and
county option, except the city of
Red Lake Falls. The Indian treaty
covering this city covers only spirit
uous liquors, and this being the
case, the brewers have made that
point a distributing center for the
entire northwest, including North
Dakota. The new order which places
beer in the category of spirituous
liquor, will stop the beer trade at
Red Lake Falls, as the whiskey
trade has already been stopped.
The Indian lid is closing down
tighter and tighter in northern Min
nesota. Under the provisions of the
old Indian treaties which were un
covered and put through the courts
through the sole efforts of W. G.
Calderwood, prohibition candidate
for U. S. Senator, more territory
has been made dry than under the
provisions of the local option andC
county option laws, of the 'state.
Moreover, the "law .being enforced
by Federal officials and not being
dependent for enforcement upon the
caprices of Jocal officials who fre
quently make a farce of local pro-*
hibitura laws to which they are per
*so!hally opposed. e,-*^
