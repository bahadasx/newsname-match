President Using Every Possible Means I
to GetMen to Postpone Strike Order I
; Administration Still Hopes
To Avert General Tie-up
of Railroad Traffic
Men Are Remaining Firm
I Washington, Aug. 30. With both
Bides making last hour preparations
j for a great railroad strike Monday
i morning. President Wilson today turn
cd all the influence of his adminis
tration toward persuading the broth
, i . 'hood leaders to postpone or rescind
their strike order until congress has
bad opportunity to ar I
There were intimations that should
the labor leaders continue firm. Pres
ident Wilson even might raakp a pub
lic appeal to the railway workers
themselves to direct their leaders to
E postpone it
Despite denials of the labor lead
ers that President Wilson or any one
else had asked them to postpone the
strike, there were abundant evidences
that such was the case, and somehow
there v. as a feeling in congress, ir.
administration circles and In oth.r
places that a way would be found to!
fe I avert the walkout No one knew
ig I what it was but tho feeling pre--1
vailed.
tsrotnernooas &tana pirm,
After a conference with Secretary
ilon at the department of labor,
the brotherhood leaders reiterated
that no power on earth except a sat
isfactory settlement would avert the
I strike and that they had no power to
rescind the ordev
. Nevertheless efforts were continued
I to bring about a postponement
The first legal phase of the situ
ation developed with the temporary
injunction .issued by a local court In
I I Nebraska restraining the conductors
from callin? or enforcing a strike on
fl I the Union Pacific. This brought up
, fir the first time the effect of the
I I much discussed Clayton anti-injunction
act passed by congress at the be
best of labor. The brotherhood lead
pre unreservedly expressed the opin
ion that the injunction was in contra
ventinn of Ihe law and cnnld not
stand. There were intimations that
similar injunctions might be issued
out in different parts of the country
where the sentiment of the men is
known to be against the strike.
While every effort was being made
to prevent the strike, both sides con
tinued to make preparations to meet
It
The -;enatr interstate commerce
committee also considered a law
1 1 passed by congres sin 1862, authoriz
inc the president to take possession
of railway ar.d telegraph lines when,
in his judgment, public safety might
require it.
Union Men Threatened.
Washington, Aug 30. President E.
P. Ripley of t he Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe issued a proclamation today
to the employes of the railroads, noti
fying them that those who fail to re
port for work next Wednesday their
places will be declared vacant and
that the employment of new men will
become permanent barring ill be

KEN ENJOINED

i
District Judge at Omaha Is
sues Order Restraining
O. R. C. From Calling
Strike.
Omaha, Nebraska, August 30.
Judge Willis E Seers of the district
court of Douglas county, today is
sued an order restraining the general
and local officials of the Order of
Railway Conductors calling or en
forcing a strike on the lines of the
Union Pacific.
The order was issued on petition or
Edwin A. Hamilton, a conductor on
the Union Pacific and a member of
i the Order of Railway Conductors,
who declares that he and many other
employes of the road are anxious to
continue at work.
Many Injunctions to Follow
Washington, August 30. The in
junction issued in Omaha which prob
ably is tho forerunner of others,
brings up squarely for the first time
in a labor dispute the effect of the
1 ; Clayton anti-injunction law.
Brotherhood leaders say injunctions
are In direct violation of the law. Its
constitutionality never has been tested
but the present crisis may bring one
I about.
Claim Labor Is Protected
The section which the labor leaders
Bay protects them from injunction
t against calling or enforcing a strike,
I I follows-
I "No restraining order or injunction
shall prohibit anv person or persons.
! whether singly or in concert from
terminating any relation of employ-1
ment, or from ceasing to perform any
work or labor, or from recommending,
advising or persuading others by
peaceful means so to do; or
from peacefully persuading any per
son t0 work or to abstain from work
ing, or from ceasing to patronize or
to employ any party to such dispute,
or from recommending, advising or
persuading others by peaceful and
lawful means s0 to do: or from pay
ing or giving to, or withholding from
any person engaged in such dispute,
any strike benefits or any monies or
things of value, nor shall
any of the acts specified in this para
graph be considered or held to be vio
lations of any law of the United
States."
The heads of the brotherhoods say
anv court order directed against them
with a purpose to preventing a strike
would be ineffective for the reason
that the strike order has passed from
their hands and they have not the
power to rernll it
Judge Sears set Saturdav morning,
September 2, for the hearing of the
order.
Hamilton. In his petition, claims the
strike order in a violation of the con
stitution of the conductors' organiza
tion which provides for a two-thirds
ote on any road where a strike is to
be called This law was changed last
May so that a two-thirds of all con
cerned In a general wage movement
governs the employes of all railroads
Involved whether the employes of an
individual road vote to strike or not
Hamilton claims the change violate
the constitution of the order.
Hamilton recites in his petition the
benefits he derives from membership
In the order and says he will lose
these if he refuses to respond to a
strike order and that if he strikes he
will lose his position ulth the rail
road, his seniority rights and pension.

WORK HOMING
INCONGRESS
Legislators Speed Up on Meas
ures to Prevent Threatened
Railway Strike.
PRESIDENT HOPEFUL
Telegrams From All Sections
Pour in Declaring Embar
goes on Perishables.
Washington. Aug. 30 Congress
went to work under pressure today to
prevent by legislation the railway
strike called for next Monday.
It was assured that, even if mcas-:
ures proposed by President Wilson in I
his address to congress yesterday eanj
not be passed in the five days re
maining, thej will be effective In
forestalling the walkout.
In general, brotherhood leaders in-,
tended to fight the legislative pro
gram and railroad managements ex
pected to support it. but both sides
laids plans for a strike as if its com
ing was beyond all doubt.
President Hope9 to Win.
President Wilson still hoped the
brotherhood leaders now in Washing
ton would find some means of res
cinding the strike order which they
maintain has gone beyond their jur
isdiction. There was no unanimity
of opinion among them as to whether
the stmm-s'.rd measure to forbid a
strike pending investigation by a pub
lic commission, if passed and made
effective before next Monday, could
apply validly to the present situation.
Hallway executives believed, how
ever, that the legislation advocated
would force a suspension of action,
possibly only by the pressure of pub
lic opinion.
Government Machinery Humming.
While government machinery was
humming with strike plans, there
poured in from all sections of the
country reports that railroads were
declaring embargoes on perishable
stuff, refusing to accept freight wlih
guarantee of prompt delivery and
warning against passenger travel ex
tending past 7 a. DO Monday, the
hour set for the strike. These re
ports gave a hint of tho rigors which
might be expected from a general
strike.
As a sequel to the conference in
Speaker Clark's office at the capitol
last night between the president and
congressional leaders of both parties,
the leaders planned another meeting
for early today to map out a course.
Arrangements were also made for a
meeting of the senate interstate com
merce committee, for it was in tho'
upper house that strike legislation
was to be threshed out first.
Members Not Fully Agreed.
Members of congress were not fully
agreed on methods, but they were re
ported as in entire accord with the
purpose to prevent in some way the
threatened tie-up. Some measures to
be agreed upon probably would be at
tached to the bill pending in the sen
ate to increase the membership of
tho Interstate Commerce commission
from seven to nine.
The eight-hour day law for inter
stale railway traffic suggested by the
president is not entirely agreeable to
the brotherhoods for they want with
the eight-hour day ten hours' pay and
congress has no authority to pre
scribe wages. The employes expect
the principal fight against this to be
made by the railroads, however.
The proposal for investigation by
a presidential commission is welcom
ed by the railroads, but not by the
nn n
The suggestion that congress em
power the Interstate Commerce com
mission to grant higher rates as re
compense for higher wages, is frown
ed upon by the railroads on the
ground that shippers would object and
their good will would be lost.
Violent Objections of Brotherhoods.
The most violent objections of the
brotherhoods is to the proposed law
for investigation of future labor dis-,
putes and the prohibition of strikes
or lockouts during the Investigation.
Railroad executives favor this meas
ure. .Many legislators believe the presi
dent's recommendation of a law au
thorizing government operation of
certain railroads for military reasons
Is superfluous; they insist that the
other action contemplated will fore
stall the strike of itself.
BROTHERHOODS
STiV BILLS
Leaders Obtain Copies of Pro
posed Measures Affecting
the Railroad Situation.
Men Meet Secretary of Labor
Wilson and Discuss Their
Side of Proposition.
Washington, August 30 Brother
hood officials, after securing copies of
the proposed bills affecting the rail
road situation, went into conference)
at the Department of Labor with Sec-
retary Wilson. It Is supposed they
intended to consider the proposed
legislation as it affects them and dis
cuss it with the Secretary of Labor.
Nfl POWER LAN
STOP THE STRIKE
President of Trainmen Is Pessi
mistic Others Are More
Hopeful of Settlement.
Washington. Aug. 30. "No 1 power
on earth except a satisfactory settle
ment c-an prevent a strike." said W.
Lee, president of the trainmen
"We four heads certainly could not
obtain a postponement of the strike if
we wanted to, nor could we postpone
it if we received messages requesting
such action from every one of the
committee of 640 who were here last
week. President Wilson has not asked
us to postpone the strike and he un
derstands, as wo made it very clear
to him on Monday night, that we now
are powerless to aet unless a satisfac
tory settlement is made."
A. B. Garrctson, head of the conduc
tors, and spokesman for the employes,
made a similar statement.
Besides conferring with Secretary
Wilson today the brotherhood heads
talked with several members of con
gress at the capitol. The brotherhood
officials expected to confer today with
Samuel Gompers. president of the
American Federation of Labor. It was
said that Mr Gompers had made no
attempt to Induce the brotherhoods
to postpone the strike and It was not
thought that he would.
Brotherhood officials, who ex
pressed confidence last night that en
actment of President Wilson's pro
gram into law would not prevent the
strike, appeared today to be less con
fident i

tion in the impending crisis, beginning
Thursday at 9 a. m. Railroad of
ficials, brotherhood officers and rep

Each side will be given three hours

RATE INCREASES
ARE SLISPENDED
Interstate Commission Re
cinds Order Making New
Schedule Effective at
Midnight.
SHIPPERS PROTEST
More Than Six Hundred Firms
Against New Demand of
The Railroads.
Washington, Aug 30. Proposed in
creases in transcontinental freighl
rates from the east to the intermoun
tain country and from the Psu Ific
I coast to the east which it was esti
mated would bring the railroads about
twenty million dollars a year addi
i tional revenue, were suspended today
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion for further investigation. They
were to have become effective at
midnight.
The commission suspended fhe rates
until December 30th, pending invest i
gation to determine their reasonable,
ness. They should have been effec
tive September 1. The increases pro
posed were on fruits, vegetables, dry
goods and many other commodities.!
More than 600 shippers were repro. '
sented here recently and protested)
against the increase. (
The increases were proposed after
the commission had held several i
months ago that transcontinental
roads did not now have to meet the
competition of the Panama canal and
that lower rates than those now in
question could not be justified for this 1
reason and for the reason that this '
transcontinental traffic should pay its
share of the total burden of transpor
tation The highes rates were pro
posed after this decision.
BIG BREAKS IN
WHEAT VALUES
Prices Drop 6 1-4 Cents a
Bushel Owing to Imminence
of General Strike.
Chicago, Aug. 30. Big breaks in
the value of wheat quickly resulted
today from announcements that in
anticipation of a general strike an
embargo on grain shipments had been
ordered to take effect Saturday on

eniet outlets frotn , , exports to
Europe. The extreme shrinkage
I amounted to C 1-4 cents a bushel.

September closed at $1 38 3-4 to
1 39 3 4 and December SI 42 1-2 to
$1.42 3-4.
Subsequently the wheat market
weakened owing to denials by offi
cials of the railway employes' organ
izations that any postponement of the
strike order would be made unless
the demands of the men were met.
Prices later plunged downward head
long owing to reports that the Penn
sylvania railroad would anticipate
! the strike by a freight embargo ef
fect Saturday. The close was un
settled .'J 1-4 to 4 3-4 net lower, with
September at $1,383-4 to 1 39 1-S and

FACING SERIOUS
MEAT SHORTAGE
Supply in Storage and in Yards
Will Last Only Three
Days.
C hicago, Aug. 30. The nation faces
a serious shortage of fresh meat m
case of a national railway strike, of
ficials of the Union Stockyards, the
world's largest cattle supply, said
today. The present supply will last
only three days.
Because of the heavy demand for
foreign export and the unusually

have been unable to lay away a sur
plus for storage, Thomas B. Wilson,
head of one of the largest packing
tirms, s.ud. 'The embargo placed by
railroads on the shipments of cattle
and other perishables probably will
mean the crippling of the entire pack-,'
Ing industry of the country, he said.
"The embargo can only result in
a shut down of certain sections of
our business," Mr. Uson added
, "The packing houses have, of course,
done what they could to prepare for
the strike. He have stored as much
as we could and we have got as much
livestock in the yards as possible. The
Bupply we have on hand, however,
will last no longer than three days.
"If the packers cannot bring in any
livestock they cannot ship out any
fresh meats under the perishable
goods prohibition."
