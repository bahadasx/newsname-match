EMBARGO PUT ON
FREIGHT SHIPMENTS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.
"God forgive you, I cannot,"
exclaimed President Wilson at
the conclusion of the final in
terview with railroad execu
tives when they rejected every
proposal.
Wilson is exerting every ef
fort to persuade the trainmen
to withdraw the September
fourth strike order.
Administration officials de
clared that trainmen will gain
nothing by strikiijg Monday.
If the trainmen struck while
congress was actually consider
ing favorable legislation nati
onal sentiment mijrht tremend-
I ously react against the unions.
I he Brothernoods indicated no
; intention of revoking the strike
order.
Officials hoped the public
would urge a strike delay, un
til congress had time to consid
er Wilson's legislation. The
strike order includes every
Brotherhood man, in the pas
senger and freight service.
The unions formally decided
'that Wilson's legislative pro-
gram naa not altered their
strike decision. Prominent
Brotherhood members asserted
that only the railroad accept
ance of the eight hour day can
halt their plans. Secretary
Garretson denied that Wilson
had flatly asked him to post
pone the strike. He also de
nied that the strike was post
poned. FIRST
