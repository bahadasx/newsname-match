In a written statement he com

He asserted also that he was going to
follow up his protest with an appeal
through his attorney to Secretary
Lansing.
interests, had been adopted as the
result of the assurances that Austria
Hungary, in declaring war against
Serbia was not Inspired by a spirit of
conquest or of territorial gains. These
assurances have not been realized.
"Today we are confronted by a sit
uation de facto threatening great ter
ritorial transformations and political
changes of a nature constituting a
grave menace to the future of Ru
mania. The work of peace which
Rumania attempted to accomplish, in
a spirit of faithfulness to the triple
alliance, thus was rendered barren by
the very powers called upon to de
fend it.
"In adhering, in 1883, to the group
of central powers, Rumania was far
from forgetting the bonds of blood
constituting between them a pledge
for her domestic tranquility, as well
as for the Improvement of the lot of
the Rumanians of Austria-Hungary.
In fact, Germany and Italy who re
constituted their states on the basic
principle of nationality, could not but
recognise the legitimacy of the foun
dation upon which their own exist
ences reposed.
"As for Austria-Hungary she found
in the friendly relations established
between her and Rumania, assurances
of tranquility both in her Interior and
on our common frontiers, for she was
bound to know to what extent the
discontent of her Rumanian popula
tion found echo amongst us, threat
ened our good relations.
"For a period of thirty years, the
Rumanians of Austria-Hungary not
only never saw a reform Introduced
but. Instead, were treated as an in
ferior race and condemned to suffer
the oppression of a foreign element
which constitutes only a minority
amidst the diverse nationalities con
stituting the Austro-Hungarian states.
"All the Injustices our brothers thus
were made to suffer maintained be
tween our country and the monarchy
a continual state of animosity. At the
outbreak of the war, Austria-Hungary
made no effort to ameliorate these
conditions. After two years of the
war, Austria-Hungary showed herself
as prompt to sacrifice her peoples
as powerless to defend them. The
war In which almost the whole of
Europe Is partaking raises the gravest
problems affecting the national devel
opment and very existence of the
states.
"Rumania, from a desire to hasten
the end of the conflict and to safe
guard her racial Interests, sees her
self forced to enter into line by the
side of those who are able'to assure
her realisation of her national unity.
For these reasons Rumania-considers
