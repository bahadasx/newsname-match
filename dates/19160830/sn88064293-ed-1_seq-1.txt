DRUG COMPANY
THE rexall store
pressed with the success of the
i experiment.
j The Gas Producer is not a
new invention and its success
has been acknowledged in many
other parts of the United States
and in foreign countries. For
more than ten years it has prov
en its meritorious value as per
haps the greatest fuel saver for
gas engines ever invented.
It remained for Mr. Lowrance
I to introduce this great econo
mic device into local usage and
I the public has him alone to
'thank for an insight into the
I practical and saving qualities of
i the machine. After a thorough
test it is Mr Lowrance's plan to
install gas producers in each of
their five company boats. Oth
ers, no doubt, will follow their
example.
The gas producer now a part
of the St. Charles is operated
by the use of coal instead of
gasoline. The cost for gasoline
per day on the St. Charles has
been about $14.00. The gas pro
ducer does the same work for
a daily cost of about $3.00. Not
only is the saving in operation
to be considered but the hand
ling of the fuel for the gas pro
ducer is done with less work
than the handling of gasoline
and the danger from explosions
and fire is eliminated as far as
the motive fuel is concerned.
Mr. E. Nelson from West
Lake, Louisiana, an employee of
the Cluny Construction Com
pany installed the Galusha Gas
Producer in the St. Charles. Mr.
Nelson stated that a fire once
started under the gas producer
would burn for from fifteen
to twenty days steadily without
additional fuel with engine at
rest and the drafts closed. He
stated also that about 665
pounds of pea coal per day is
required to operate the gas pro
ducer with the engine running
constantly and that the amount
of coal was the same in
weight as the gasoline required
for the same operation but that
the cost of the coal would
amount to less than $3.00 for
a ten hour run while the cost of
gasoline for the same run will
amount to about $14.00. The
work of installation done by Mr.
Nelson was all accomplished at
the Watkins machine shop at
Berwick and the Hogan Ma
chine Shop on the Morgan City
side. The boat has been re
modeled completely in its engine
room, deck and pilot house. She
looks trim and capable and is
one of the strongest boats in the
fish and oyster business of
Louisiana.
Placing the Galusha Gas Pro
ducer aboard the St. Charles by
Mr Lowrance is a project that is
closely observed by other consu
mers of gasoline fuel. His judge
ment and action here-to-fore
has produced satisfactory
results for the large business
managed by him and his pro
gressive innovation in the gas
producer no doubt will increase
the esteem in which he is held
by his business associates. Not
only the Louisiana Fish and
Oyster Company will benefit by
the success of Mr. Lowrance's
latest undertaking but the
great number of heavy motive
fuel users that are to be found
among other business interests
in Morgan City territory.
