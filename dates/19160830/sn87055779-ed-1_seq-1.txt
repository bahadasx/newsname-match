-Austria-Hungary was de-
ceived by Roumania and as late as
Sunday the Austrian minister at Bu
charest was assured by Premier
Rrattiano of Roumania that the
country would remain neutral, ac
cording to dispatches printed in
Vienna papers today.
The Austrian minister called up
on Premier Rrattiano in Bucharest
on Sunday morning and it was then
that he received assurances of con
tinued neutrality. At that moment,
the Austrian newspapers charge, tho
declaration of war was in the hands
of the Rour.i.'nian premier.
Jt is declared here that Roumania
was forced into the war by Russia.
On Sunday afternoon following hia
conference with the premier, tho
Austrian minister at. Bucharest call
ed upon King Ferdinand. The kin?
declared that he did not want war
and hoped that the crown council
would decide in favor of neutrality.
The report of the British wireless

Bucharest pleaded with King Fer

newspaper? here and "only worthy
of cheap melodrama."

Newspapers in some neutral coun

was practically an ally of the central
powers until she declared war. Th
Vienna Fiomenbladt in commenting
upon the situation says:
"It can be said that until 9 o'clock
Sunday night Roumania was our
ally."
The Rernerbund calls it "a dark
war of conquest."
The Xeu Züricher Zeitung says:
"Roumania has been receiving all
her coal from Germany and Austria,
She has also receied food from tho
central powers. Without Austria's
help Roumania would have long
since been a Russian province and
now the first shot in the war against
