RUSSIAN DRIVE LOSSES
PLACED AT 750,000 MEN
Berlin, Aug. 11 .?The cor
respondent of the "Zeitung
am Mittag" at Austrian head?
quarters in a dispatch de
scribes the enormous losses
of the Russians during the
summer offensive.
The correspondent says the
Russan censorship passed the
statement that as many as
sevcnty-five trains, loaded
with wounded. were moved
daily on the line to Kiev
alone. Basing his estimate
partly on the official list kept
at Kiev, the correspondent
places the Russian killed or
wounded in the summer of?
fensive at 750.000 men.
"The Russians," the cor?
respondent continues, "are
fighting mueh more bravely
than in 1915. The new
troops are courageous and
well disciplined, and their
officers lead their lines into
the thickest of the fight.
Hence the mortality among
officers is very heavy, in?
cluding generals."

London, Aug. 11. The Italians have ;
cleared the way for an advance on
Trieste along the railroad skirting th<!
gulf.
In a series ot brilliant attacks they
have eonquered the whole of the Do?
berdo plateau. taking by storm the
strongholds of San Martino del Carso
Btad Rubbia.
South of Gorizia the Isonzo bend*
lharpi** to the west, forming 1 deep ;
salient between Gorizia and Monfal?
cone. This wedge made dangerous an
advance from either point, for the flank j
of the advancing army laid itself open
to attack.
The Italian plan contemplates two .
movements. eastward, one along tho
railway running from Gorizia throutrh ;
St. Daniel and the other along the
CSastal road from Monfalcone to
Trieste. The advance from Monfalcone
has been held up for more than seven
months because of this flank threat.
Auatrian Salient Wiped Ont.
When Gorizia fell the Duke of Aosta
began the clearing of the Carso plateau,
on which lay the Austrian wedgo. Kor
three days thc battle has continued,
until finally the Austrian salient has
been completely dislodged and the line
between Gorizia and Monfalcone
.,traightened. Thc Teutons have fallen
back to the line of the Vallerie.
This vietory makes it possible for
the Italians to begin an advance along
the eoaat without uanger to their flank.
While one army is battling for the
heights east of Gorizia another can
begin the march from Monfalcone,
forcine two wedges into the Austrian
line that arill s-iuffze the enemy out
of the Carso plateau. When this has
been accomplished the road for an in
vasion of intenor Austria will be opi-n.
Behind Gorizia the battle continues
with unceasing fury. The Italian cav
nlry and 'cyciists are driving the Aus
trian* from the valleys eaat of the
fortress city. The Teutons are retreat
ing along the railway line toward
Dornberg and striving to reform their
line in tnat neighborhood.
Battle for Gorizia Kidgea.
Kor the moment the battle in thi*
sector centres on the heights east of
Gorizia. At some points the Italians
already have pushed forward eight
miles beyond Gorizia, but the Aus?
trians still hold some ridges. A fun
oiii combat is in progress for Monte
San Gabnele and Monte San Marto,
northeast of Gorizia.
The Italians have already taken more
than lo.0"0 prisoners since the fail of
Gorizia, according to reports from the
front Including the captives taken
in the battles for the fortress this
would bring the total number of Aus?
trian pn-oners to 30,000. Ihe Aus?
trians claim to have captured more
than 4,000 men in the last few days.
At vanous other parts of the front
the Austrians are attacking in the ef?
fort to relieve th..- pressure on the
Carso plateau and the inereasing men?
ace to Trieste. An espeeially strong
attack was made at Monte Nero. None
of these has suceeeded in divertinjr the
Italians from the battle in Istna, how?
ever.

London, Aug. 11.?Stanislau has fallen. The Russians
captured the Galician fortress city last night without a shot.
The Teutonic Allies apparently are unable to stem the
Allied tide. The Italians, continuing their drive toward Trieste,
took the Doberdo Plateau by storm, and in the West the
French pushed closer to Combles.
Salonica reports the opening of the battle on the Ralkan
front. This marks a new chapter in the Allied offensive. with
the application of further pressure on the Central Power.--.
BrussilofFs plan seems still to be developing. Rapid as
was the evacuation and seizure of Stanislau, and important as
it is to the Czar's troops in their march on Lemberg. this stroke
was equalled by the day's developments north of the Dniester
River.
General LetcWUky's right wing advanced nearly twenty
five miles to the northwest and eight miles to the north from
the confluence of the Dniester and the Zlota Lipa.
To-night the Russians are within five miles of Halitz, the
key to Lemberg on the southwest, and have established them
selves in positions directly in the rear of von Bothmer's right
flang along the Stripa.

('reece, nearly 700,000 men for the of?
fensive.
Sarratl commands a ma^'niticent
Anglo-Freneh and Serbian army, which
is likely to make thu Bulgarians pay
bitterly for their treacherous desertion
of Serbia last fall. With the Russian,
the Krench, the British and finally the
joint Allied offensive* in full awinj- the
drive from Salonica would find a weak
cned opposition.
Bulgaria Ready to Quit.
Bulgaria has all *he desire*. and il
ready to quit the fray. She threw in
her lot with the Teuton* at a time
when victory for them *eemed certain.
Hut with the constantly increasing
power of the Allie* the whole aspect
has changed.
Report* reaohing London lately de?
clared that Bulgaria was gunning for a
separate peace. Dispatches irom Ath
ens even declared that Czar Ferdinand
was ready to tran?fer hi* allegiance to
the Allie*. Rut whatever action Bul?
garia take*, the offensive through Ser
bia arill have great effect on Greece
ar.d Rumania.
If Vonizelo* is elected Premier Kiag
f'onstanttne arill b* foreed to declare
for the Allies. Bucharest ha* long
Oeen waverinir, and a show of Allied
Bowai in Iha BalBBBa, coupled with the
Russian victorie*. may prove the final
inducement to bring her into the Al?
lied rank*.
Whole Line Inder Fire.
Artillery lightinjr continue* along the
whole Serbian line, with numerou*
patrol engagement.*. Berlin tell* of
"sham attacks" with weak deUchmetitB,
which were repulsed, but give* no fur?
ther hint of an extended offen?i?e.
The Doiran station lieg five miles
east ot the town. Report* from the
frrnit say that the ground in front of
the captured positions was filled with
bodies of Bulganan*. Doiran wa* the
?cene ot costly attack* by the Allies in
December, 1915.
The only offleial statement on the
new operations in the Balkans come*
from Berlin.
"South of Lake Doiran," it ?ay*. "the

detachment* which were repulsed by
our fire without ?eriouj fit-L^in'-."
5,000 More Aoatrlana Baggcd.
Kortified heights, etrongly defended
river positions, villages and towns have
succumbed before the onalaughts of
Letchitsky's troops. In two days and
nights they have thinned the exhauated
forces of the enemy so that he is no
longer able to offer strong resistance.
Ten thousand Austrian aoldiera have
dropped from the ranks in the last
forty-eight hours. half of them swept
into the huge Russian bag of prison?
ers. No longer are the retreating
foreea attempting to save their armi
from the wreckage.
With the fail of Monasterzyska and
the advance of the Russians to the very
outskirta of Halitz the southern jaw of
the Russian vise has begun to crush in
the right wing of von Bothmer's army.
To day's fighting along the Sereth,
south of Brody, brought the northern
jaw nearer the point on the Austrian
commander's left flank where th*
squeeze will begin. The pressure of
SakharofT'a troops compelled the Aus?
trians to abandon two fortified towns
in thia aection to-da;', and the Rus?
sians are still forging ahead.
Bothmer Left One Retreat I.lne.
To escape from the jaws rapidly
closmg in on him, von Bothmer must
soon withdraw his lines to the Gn.'i
Lipa over the sole road of retreat left,
To-day'a Russian B'.i<tcs?*s north of
the Dniester have robbed the Au?tnan
general of a safe defensive position
along the Zlota Lipa and SakharofT'a
seizure of t.liadki. ha* made tha
Tarnopol-Krasne-Lembertr line unsafe.
By way of the line through Totutor*/
alone can the imperilled Auatnana
make good their escape.
Stanislau and Halit.: are the south?
ern gateways to Lemberg. Nothing
can now prevent the Kussians from
pushing forward to the last defences
of the Galician capital. Stanislau,
flanked and almost surrounded. was
captured easily. Kor Halitz the Aus
triana are expected to make a greater
fight. But the power of Letchitsky'a
machine strengthena the theory that
the Russians will also win this city
within a few daya.
Berlin and Vtenna contirm to-nrght
Petrograd's reports of these Russian
successes. "We ha\e ev.icuated Stanis?

night's Geiman eommunique.
Stokhod Attacka < cniinue
Brusailoff's troops continue their
spirited attacks along thr Mokhod line,
but the lack of any concerted move?
ment of strength in this sector indi
cates that the Czar's commander is
merely exerting "ufneent preasure oa
?on Linsingen to prevent the transfcr
