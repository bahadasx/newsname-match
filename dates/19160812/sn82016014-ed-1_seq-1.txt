Washington. Aug. 12. President

notion that would result in paralyzing
traffic, he wishes UJalk with them.
New York. Aug. 12. Settlement of
the controversy between 400,000 rail
way employes and the railway man
agers of the country this afternoon
appeared impossible without an appeal
to President Wilson or a strike tiems
up 225 railways of the country. Mem
bers of the federal board of mediation
r.nd conciliation have not abandoned
hope. They were endeavoring to per
suade the employes to consent to ar
bitration this afternoon. So far this
I as been rejected.
Mediation has failed. The railway
managers insist they are ready to face
a strike if the men refuse to arbitrate.
The employes just as f irmly re iterate
that arbitration has failed before, and
consequently they cannot consent to
It now.
Mediators Meet 0 Delegates.
While continuing their work, the
mediators are dubious of sucess. After
a session with six hundred "P""-tiv-s

arbitration. One of the brotherhood

London, Aug. 12. The advance
guard of the Russian force that occu

northeast of the city and crossed the
river Zlota Bistritza, 1 8 miles south of
Haltiz, according to Petrograd dis
patches today.
The Austro-Germans offered but
weak resistance and then continued
their retreat north. Several guns were
abandoned by the enemy In their re

Two separate Russian forces are
now converging on Halltz, the Imme

In his drive against Lemberg. The
first, moving eastward along the north
bank of the Dneister, is less than
twenty miles from Halltz. The second,
operating south of the Dneister, Is
composed of the detachments that
took Stanislau.

There is no Indication in dispatches
from either Petrograd, Berlin or
Vienna that the Russian advance, the
most rapid made by any army since
the Austro-Germans Balkan cam
paign, has even been slowed up. In
four days the Slavs have progressed
twenty miles, and in the fighting about
Stanislau alone they have taken nearly
twenty villages and towns.
Battling over much more difficult
country, the Italians have scored suc
cesses of equal importance in their
southward swing toward Trieste. The
news from both Petrograd and Rome
suggests that the demoralization of
the Austrian armies may be more
complete than earlier advices indi

Tom Taggart Denounces Pork
and False Economy.
Broke Into Senatorial Habits
Member Only Two Weeks.
Washington. Aug. 12. Tom Taggart
of Indiana told the senate today after
a membership of but a few weeks,
just what he thought of It. Tho giv
ing it full credit for passage of legis
lation favored by President Wilson he
rapped its failure to attain business
economy, muck-raked its river and
harbors and public buildings bills as
, "pork" measures, and declared for a
j budget system of national appropria
tions, uia time senators stared at
the presumption of 'a newcomer tear
ing into fixed senatorial habits.
Many of them left their seats. But
none interrupted.
"Instead of squandering money in
catching cattle ticks, killing coyotes,
poisoning ground squirrels, doctoring
wild ducks, treating goats suffering
from malta fever, sending out onion
seeds to folks who want a front gar
den, and seeds to folks who want car
rots and turnips, let's get down to bed
rock economy," said Taggart.
"Or, if congress has a fixed and de
termined purpose to increase appro
priations wouldn't it be better to ap
ply this money to helping farmers get
intensive agricultural training or' city
boys to learn good mechanical
trades?"
Taggart read a list of towns where
public building appropriations auth
orized in a bill now pending averaged
from $12.20 to $14.55 for each inhab
itant. He said $20,000,000 too much
was appropriated this year for rivers

Topeka Woman Made Superin
tendent Girls School.
Capper Appoints President
Women's Temperance Union.
Governor Capper today announced
the appointment of Mrs. Lillian
Mitchner of Topeka. as superintendent
of the state industrial school for girls
at Beloit. The appointment was made
on recommendation of members of the
state board of corrections and is ef
fective September 1.
Mrs. Mitchner was appointed to suc
ceed Miss Frankie, Wilson of Inde
pendence. Recently Miss Wilson sent
her resignation to Governor Capper,
following two stormy years at the
school and a recent investigation by
a committee appointed by the govern
or. Her resignation, made public sev
eral weeks ago, is effective Septem
ber 1.
Came as a Surprise.
The appointment of Mrs. Mitchner
.me as a surprise, as she had not
been included in the list of candidates
doped for the place. Her appointment
is in recognition of members of the
State Temperance union, which was
active in securing the establishment
of the state school for girls. Mrs
Mitchner is president of the Women's
Temperance Union of Kansas and has
for years been active in temperance
work and the affairs of women's clubs
in the state. For several years she
has been a member of the visitation
committee and has come in personal
contact with conditions in the Peloit
school. She was originally appointed
on the committee by Governor Hodges.
Factional strife has been the cause
of much trouble at Beloit. Miss Wil
son inherited troubles of Mrs. Julia
B Perry, her predecessor, and was con
stantly on one end or the other of lo
cal controversies. Lack of diplomacy
in meeting conditions was responsible
for much of Miss Wilson's trouble, it
is asserted, and her resignation fol
lowed two years of almost constant
turmoil.

Few states have shown such records

Efficiency of Main Assault.
Hughes's Voice . Becovers At
Billings, Mont, Last Night.
Helena. Mont., Aug. 12. Governor
Hughes expects to try a new cam
paigning stunt this afternoon. Ho Joy
fully accepted an invitation to de
scend 2,800 feet into the depths of the
Leonard copper mine at Butte. Mrs.
Hughes, who hasn't deserted her hus
band's side through the other hard-,
ships of the transcontinental trip.
which her husband is making to win
votes for the presidency, wanted to
go but It was decided she had better
not.
John H. Mcintosh of Butte, who
joined the Republican nominee's par
ty here today, made the announcement
of the governor's underground search
for votes. He told the governor ths
trip might prove of Interest, but he
wanted to warn him In advance that
mines werj not the safest things in the
world and that he did not have to ac
cept the invitation.
"You can bet I want to go," ths
governor responded quickly. "There
are lots of men who work in mines
every day and I'm not in the least -afraid
anyway."
Now "concentrates Fire."
The Leonard mine is not the biggest
of Butte's underearth industries, but
the committee held it to be better
adapted for sightseeing. The governor
will be furnished with Jumpers and
overalls.

HITS PRINTERS HARD
High Cost of Paper May 'Throw Thou
sands Out of Work.
Baltimore, Aug. 12. The danger
that thousands of printers may be
thrown out of work because of the
high cost of white paper was rld to
be a question seriously concerning tle
delegates to the sixty-second annual
convention of the International Typo
graphical union, which begins here
next Monday. .
The committee on laws, through
whose hands all new laws for submis
sion to the convention must first pass.
j has been in session for several days
considering about 100 amendments
about 100
and new laws submitted by local
unions. The delegates began arriving
in large numbers today. John W.
Hays, secretary-treasurer of the union,
said the alarming shortage of print
paper is making it difficult for mpny
I newspaper corporations to continue
( business. In some cities, he said.
(there was talk of consolidating two or
j more plants-to reduce working forces
jand expenses.
