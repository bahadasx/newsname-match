Death of Allen N. Burg.
"Leaves have their time to fall,
And flowers to wither at the
north wind's breath,
And stars to set-but all,
Thou hast all seasons for
thine own, oh death."
The above beautiful lines have
come home to us this week in the
fullness of their meaning; an3
again the feebleness and impo
tence of human effort when op
posed to divine decree has once
more been demonstrated, and
again our hearts wrung with sor
row and our heads bow with
grief.
Relentless Death has once more
collected a heavy toll and left in
its wake saddened homes and a
sorrowing community.
On the threshold of his young
career, surrqunded by all
that makes life dear and worth
livilg, a devoted young wife,
doting parents, many warm
friends and a future suffused
with the rose-glow of love and
happiness, MR. ALLEN N.
BURG, was stricken by the
powerful hand of death at the
Presbyterian Hospital in New
Orleans Wednesday, August 2.
1916 after an illness of short dur
ation, and a spell of gloom and
sadness was cast over the en
tire community where he was
universally loved and cherished
by every one whose happy lot it
was to have known him.
Deceased was a native of La
badeville, La., and was only 28
years of age at the time of his
sad demise.
He was one of the best known
sawyers of Southern Louisiana,
and had been a resident of
Jeanerette, La., for a number of i
years.
Impressive funeral services
were held at the St. John's Ca
tholic Church in Jeanerette, La.,
on Thursday, August 3rd., inst.,
and the-large concourse of sor
rowing relatives and sympathiz
ing friends who followed the re.,
mains to their last resting placet
bore eloquent testimony to the
esteem in which Mr. -Burg was
universally held, and constituted
a fitting tribute to the memory
of such an upright young citizen,
faithful friend, doting young
husband and devoted son.
A tender loving young wife
who has constantly stood by his
side through weal and woe, is lft
to mourn the loss of her loyal
helpmate, together with a kind
father, and bereaved mother,
Mr. and Mrs. X. Burg, seven
brothers, Acklen, Paul, Whitney

Laws Announced

ties for New Department
r DOLLAR LICENSE
BIGGEST FEATURE
Announcement was madet
Saturday by M. L. Alexander,
reappointed commissioner of
conservation, Tof changes made
in the game laws at the recent
meeting of the legislature. The
conservation commission is here
after to be known as the depart
ment of conservation, and will
be one commissioner instead of
three, known as the commission
er of conservation. The new de
partment will have all the duties
authorities, power, privileges
and jurisdiction of the former
commission.
The most important change
made, from the standpoint of the
sportsmen of Louisiana, was the I
enactment of a uniform dollar
hunting license required of every c
one huuting. This takes the i
place of the former statute, that
allowed free hunting in wards, a
50-cent parish license, and a $3
statewide license. With the new
law everyone going into the fields r
or marshland with a gun must
have a license and the state-wide
dollar license will permit hunting c
in any part of the state save
parishes where special regula.
tions protect .certain game for a
special closed seasons or" on the l
areas sqt aside for resting places
or refuges fr the game.
Few changes were made in the I
open seasons for the hunting of
i game birds, and the only ones so
Iaffected were quail, wild turkey
gobblers, snipe and upland plover
or papabotte. The season for Bob
White quail and turkey cocks
opens November 15 and closes 1
March 1. The season for snipe C
opens on November 1, and closes
March 15, thus lengthening the r
shooting season for this favorite , i,
game bird one month and per
mitting shooting when these "
birds are most plentiful. For all t
the other birds on the game I
bird list-geese, ducks, night t
herons, (gros-bec) rails, (mud I
hens) gallinules, coots (poule
d'eau) sandpipers, (cherocks)
tattlers, curlews, plovers, doves
and red-winged blackbirds, the
regular season prevails -Novem
bsr 1 to February 15.
A apecial closed season for a
three years, to December 31, 1919 t
was enacted for the following t
game birds: Prairie chickens,
killdeers, upland plovers, (papa
botte) ring-necked pheasants and
wild turkey hens. The law fur
ther provides that after 1919 a
these birds may only be hunted I
from November 1 to December 31
of any year. Announcement
was made by the department of
conservation in relation to the
passage of this special closed i
season that all agents would be'1
given specialorders to enforce t
this act to the letter and bring ]
all offenders before the courts. 1
The legislature also repealed ,
the lay that permitted the kil-I
ling of sea gulls during an open (
season. Therepealing of this act l
now places these valuable sea
birds on the "protected" list
with the other valuable insecti
vorous birds of the state, and any
killing of sea gulls wil lay the
violator open to the penalties1
pr.scrlbed for the killi. of non
Sgame birds.
No new laws were enated per I-I
taining to the farbersdg nat-1I

will not be lawful untli the first
of October. The hunting of deer
I will open in the northern zone
Vernon, Rapides, Avoyelles, Con
cordia, and all parishes north of
them-September 15, and close
January 5, The season for the
southern zones, all parishes south
of those named, opens fifteen
days later, October 1, and closes
January 20.
The special attention of sports
men and other hunters is called
to the facts that the shooting of
valuable insectivorous birds,
known locally as caille and gras
set, is unlawful and violators of
the non-game bird are liable to
heavy penalties in the courts.
The robin, the kingbird, (black
grasset) red-eyed vireo, (green
grassct) catbird, (black caille)
wood thrush, (caille pivelee or
speckled caille) little green heron
(capcap) cedarbirds, (ortolans)
are birds once known as game
birds, but are now protected and
all hunters are warned by the
conservation authorities not to
kill them.
The $1 state wide hunting
license applies only to resident
amateur hunters. The resident
professional hunter's license or
"market hunter" remains at $10
un-naturalized foreign-born resi
aents, $15; non-resident of the
state, $15. The fur trapper's
license remains at $2, as in the
past seasons.
Edenborn Line uses Part
of St. Louis Hotel For
New Depot
Pres. Wm. Edenborn of the
Louisiana Railway Navigation
Co. make the interesting an
nouncement that the front of the
new passenger station in New Or
kins will be builtout of the front
o,f the historic old St. Louis Ho
tel, now in process of demolition.
The preservation of this architec
tural souvenir of old New Orleans
by the Edenborn Line was receiv
ed with rejoicing in New Orleans
rnd many expressions of grati
tude to the Railroad company.
'he Louisiana Historical Society,
the Association of Commerce and
other civic and patriotic organza
tions are expected to formally
thank the management. Vice
Pros. B. M. Helm states that, as
a strictly Louisiana road the La.
Railway & Navigation Co was en
abled to combine pleasure with
business in thus finding the mean
to accomplish the preservation of
the famous old hotel The fact that
the Edenborn Line is going to
have its own passenger terminals
in New Orleans is significant of
the development to a railroad
which operates wholly within
Louisiana. The depot will be only
a few blocks from the Illinois
Central-Southern. Pacific U rion
Depot.
