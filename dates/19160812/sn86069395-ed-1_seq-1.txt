Hopkinsville Is pulling off two biff
things today the Fcrrcll reunion and
the closing of the Forbes pony con
test. Whether ho is elected President or
riot, Judge Hughes has already quali
.fied. himself for admission to Teddy's
Ananias Club.
Candidate Hughes is starting his
campaign oaa "view with alarm" ba
sis. On the other hand President
Wilson will "hail with pleasure."
The Henderson Gleaner says peti
tions will soon" be in circulation call
ing for an election to be held in that
city next November to determine if
the voters are in favor of n commis
sion form of government for Hender
son. Many newspaper consolidations arc
taking place in Michigan, due to the
increased cost of running. Kalama
zoo now has only one paper for the
first time in 70 years. At Bay City,
Muskegon and Lansing, consolida
tions have brought about the same
conditions.
The expected thing has happened
at last. With hundreds of automo
biles traveling the narrow streets of
Hopkinsville at all hours, some of
them at a high rate of speed and
many of them recklessly driven, it
was to be expected that somebody
would be killed or injured sooner or
later. It is not too late to save other
lives, by a strict enforcement of ex
isting laws and by passing other laws

Whether or not the day of August
6th was legally past at 9:30 o'clock
that night, will decide whether Judge
Bush's successor will be elected this
fall or next fall. If Judge Hanbery
had lived three hours longer, there
would have been no doubt. The
election begins at 6 a. m. Nov. 7 and
counting days and nights to the hour,
Aug. 7 at 6 a. m. would be three
months before the election. But the
only hours left of the preceding day
were in the night, after the day had
passed. The wise ones will have to
pass on the question raised.
On the third page of this issue of
the Kentuckian, the Ferrell's Boys
and the public generally will find
some interesting programs of forty
years ago, when the closing exercises
of Ferrell's High School were held
at old Mozart Hall, where Hotel Lath
am now stands, and there was a grand
display of fervid oratory. Forty
years is a considerable stretch of
time, but a good many of the partici
pants in the exercises of those years
will be on the platform to-night and
some of them will make the same
speeches made then. The program
to-night will be the most unique en
tertainment ever given in Hopkins
ville. BOOSTERS FOR
BIG ROCK
R. E. Cooper Will Head a
Delegation of Road
Advocates.
A boosters' meeting for the trip to
Big Rock to boost good roads was
held at the H. B. M. A. last night.
Secretary John Kicharus ana rresi
dent R. E. Cooper, of the Christian
County Good Roads association, havo
been working up the interest in the'
trip. It seems now that Hopkinsville
will mako a good showing today and
will help the Stewart county people
decide the issue correctly.
It was not known just how many
would go when the Kentuckian went
I to press. Judge Walter Knight, R.
E, Cooper and Colonel W. R. Howell
are down as chief orators of tho oc
casion. Ambition--Somethin2 that makes a

CHILD
RUN
OVERJHUTO
Injuries May Be Fatal As the
Little Girl Was Render
ed Unconscious.
CAR OF A. A. FURGERSON
Was Traveling At a High
Rate of Speed On East
Seventh Street.
Nellie May Charlton, aged 12,
daughter of Albert M. Charlton, was
probably fatally injured Thursday
afternoon at about six o'clock, when
she was struck by an automobile
driven by A. A. Furgerson. The ac
cident occurred just in front of the
child's home at Seventh and Railroad
streets, as she started across the
street.
The machine, according to eye wit
nesses, was going rapidly for city
travel. The machine struck the girl
and threw her heavily and ran over
her.
The most serious injury she sus
tained was a complicated fracture of
the skull at the base of the brain.
Her physicians state her condition
is critical. Furgerson did not stop
his car for some distance and later
surrendered to the police, who held
him under bond to answer to the
charge of assault.
Until recently he- was a saloon
keeper doing business at 11 North
Virginia street.
Paul Winn was sitting in front of
his office in plain view of the acci
dent. He tells the following story:
"The child was playing with her
little sister and another child on the
opposite side of the street. She
started across the street after one au
tomobile had passed. Mr. Furger
son s car was coming about seventy
five feet behind the first car at a high
rate of speed. He did not sound a
whistle or horn. There were no other
vehicles near at the time. The child
was within three feet of the curbing
when the car struck her. It hit her
fairly with the front of the car and
ran over her, both wheels on the
righthand side passing over her body.
She was knocked unconscious, cut,
lacerated and bruised and thrown
against the curb. ' The car did not
make any attempt to slow up or stop
but went on. I picked the girl up
and carried her into the house. Mr.
George Clark, who also saw the ac
cident, saw that I had ran to pick up
the child, and stopped the car."
Mr. Clark was on his way home
and was crossing the railroad, about
twenty feet from the accident when
it occurred. Ho tells virtually the
same story of the tragic occurrence
as Mr. Winn.
The car that passed in front was
that of T. M. Jones.
The child was doing satisfactorily
yesterday although the doctors con
sider her injuries very serious and
painful. The skull is fractured on the
base near the right ear.
Mr. Furgerson, who was arrested
by officers Cliborne and Hawkins
Thursday night on a charge vof mali
cious assault, was held on bond until
Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock, when
examining trial before City Judge
Hunter Wood, Jr., will be held.

Early Birds.
The early birds began to come home
I to roost Thursday morning.
Thd first arrival from a distance
was Jacob H. Colin, of Lawrence,
Kansas, 1870. Ho was promptly tak
en in ihand by his cousin, Mose Elb,
who confided to his friends, "Jake.is
one of my cousins that I'm proud of."
He will live on the fat of the land
while his capitalist relative is looking
after his welfare.
Thursday morning Wallace Kelly,
first honor man of 1891 and
1892, now of Houston? Texas, also
came in and is with his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Walter Kelly. He was not
here last year and all the boys will
give him the glad hand.
Lawson B. Flack, 1901, now in the
service of his country at Ft. Thomas,
came home on a furlough. The boys
were regretting his absence, since he
proved one of the most popular boys
in the reunion last year, and his uneX'
pected arrival caused much pleasure.

BAD WEATHER IN WEST
Italians Continue to Push For
ward in Isonzo and are
East of Gorizia.
London, Aug. 11. Although bad
weather is hampering the British and
French maneuvers in the west, botli
the Italians and Russians are keeping
up their strong offensives against the
Teutonic allies, respectively in Aus
tria and Galicia and at last reports
had made additional gains.
On the Isonzo front the Italians
havo continued to throw their forces
across tho river and have fought their
way to the east of the captured city
of Gorizia. The prisoner toll is placed
at 20,000.
In addition southwest of Gorizia
they have taken strong Austrian en
trenchments near Monte San Michele
and Monte San Martino and also oc
cupied the town of Bischini, giving
them a freer hand for their operations
in the region of the Doberdo plateau
and southward toward the Monfal
cone sector. Large numbers of pris
oners were taken in the fighting.
Owing to the inclement weather in
France, military activity has been
confined principally in bombardments
which were somewhat heavy north
of the Somme and inThiaumontwork
near Verdun. An attempted German
advance against the British line south
of Martinpuich was put down by the
I of trench mortars and machine guns,
according to London.
Fierce fighting is still going on be
tween the Turks and Russians on the
Mush-Bitlis front in Turkish Armenia.
A squadron of twenty-one Austrian
aeroplanes has dropped a large num
ber of bombs on Venice, causing nu
merous fires in the historic city.

partments That is Sure to
Receive Attention.
J. W. STOWE IN CHARGE
Prizes of $5 Will Be Given
on Best Pair of Many
Breeds.
No department of the Pennyroyal
Fair, which begins Tuesday, August
29, has been worked up better or will
prove a more attractive arid popular
feature than the Poultry Show. J. W.
Stowe, one of the best poultry men in
the county, has this department under
his personal supervision and will
spare no labor or expense to make a
display of fancy fowls more than suit
all the lovers of the feathered species
in this section.
No barriers will be placed on the en
tries and the entries are not confined
to the county or state. By virtue of
this open door to the coops some of
the best fowls in the country will bo
displayed at the fair. However, in
order to give the poultry raisers of
this county an opportunity to decitlo
this question of who is raising the
best fowls, a Christian county special
series of contests will bo held. Prizes
of . $5 for each pair will be given
for the best couple of fowls in tho
following classes:
Barred Plymouth Rocks, White
Plymouth Rocks, Partridge Plymouth
Rocks, White Wyandottes, Golden

R. C. Rhode Island Reds, White Or
pingtons, Black Orpingtons, Buff Or
pingtons, White Leghorns, Brown
Leghorns, Buff Leghorns, Light Brah
ma, Dark Brahma, Buff Cochin, Part
ridge Cochin, Dark Cornish, Ano
nas, Campine, Best pair Bantams.
The chicken family will come in for
most attention in the Poultry Depart
ment, but the other members of the
fowl nice will not be entirely left out.
Quite to the contrary they have come
in for generous attention in the lists
of awards. Turkeys, geese and ducks
will be attended to in the contents for
excellence and the same award will be
given.
One of the most imjrortant awards
of the fair and one that will be covet
ed by all the poultry raisers who en
ter fowls in the coops, will be the
Judge's Cup. This award is given
by Judge J. T. Milligan, and will
consist of a handsome silver cup with
