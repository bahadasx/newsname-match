You hope that in the future you will have more leisure
and more property than you have now.
, That is a worthy ambition. The only way to realize it
is to reserve a part of your earnings and turn them into
capital. They become so even while drawing interest, and
they are at hand when a way for more productive invest
ment opens.
Beginmaking that capital now. .

Two years ago the Union Pacific
railroad distributed to its stockholders
in an extra dividend 74 millions of
dividend-paying Baltimore & Ohio
The Com- stock besides an extra in cash, and
r. Gassman's business o -m c tl.
was that it was unfair to other rail
roads for one road to be p"l:n? up such
profits and surpluses, the U. P. surplus
two years ago being about 170 million
dollars.- But again thi3 road is em
barrassed by its growing surplus. After
paying the 8 per cent dividends this
year the road was obliged to add to its
surplus 132 millions of profits, in. spite
of liberal expenditures for improve
ments and upkeep. So that the surplus
now is again over 100 million dollars, in
fact oyer 110 millions.'' Charging off
74 millions of assets by extra dividends
did little good to this too-prosperous
organization. It is still an obstacle to
the efforts of less fortunate roads in
tasking higher rates. Topeka Capital.

Experiment , Staticn Notes.
Now is an ideal time to come out to
the Experiment Station and , see the
forty different varieties of sorgham3
being, grown side by side for forage
purposes. The Freed Sorghum, often
called White Cane, is among the best
this year. It is anspecial drouth re
sistant variety developed by J. K.
Freed, a farmer living near Scott
city, jvansa3. inis variety compares
most favorably in a dry year, like 1916
because it is very early maturing.
The earliest planting is now practically
ripe, while another planting made July
1st, is three feet high and heading out.
If visitors will call at the Experi
ment Station office, the location of all
experiments will be pointed cut and it
will often be possible to have a guide
accompany thsm.

very successfully for poisoning grass
