In the heart of the business dis

told, the owners have refused flve
million dollars.
.This is a very cosmopolitian city
composed of people from almost
every part of the world. All banks
and stores have foreign department'
where all languages are spoken.
I note some banks pay two per
cent interest on checking accounts,
and four per cent on savings. I sug
gest the two per cent to our two
parish banks. .It's a winner.
I find also that movies do not move
on Sundays, and baseball ditto, and
barber shops and other places like

drawbacks (?0 the town is not a
dead one.
A few days ago, I read in a loca,l
paper, an interview with a represen

who said he had been in every quart

Pittsburg is the industrial giant of
the world.
Just imagine, if the reader can,
that the wealth of this Allegheny
country exceeds that. of thirty-seven

that the Covington people are going
to give an exhibition of civic pride
to repair -storm damage at the park.
