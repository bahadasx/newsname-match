Explosion of 50-Gallon Can of
Gasoline Shakes Kansas
City's Little Italy.
A FORMER GUNMAN A HERO
John Lozlo Rushed Into Burning
Building and Carried Out a
Mother and Baby.
A small boy, a match, and a fifty
gallon tank of gasoline wero the com
bination that caused an explosion
which rocked Llltlo Italy at Kansas
City, creuted two heroes nnd resulted
In the death of the boy at Wesley
hospital.
Shortly after S o'clock the boy, Jdo
Fermaturo, S years old, found tho
match and lighted It, igniting the leak
ago from a big gasoline tank in the
rear of the residence and store build
ing at 405-7 East Third street. When
the explosion came he was either
hurled into tho basement or ran there
to get away from the leaping flames.
Tho explosion wrecked the build
ing. With a part of tho wreckage,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Fermaturo, par
ents of tho boy, wero blown into the
street. They immediately began a
search for their son.
Little Italy quickly gatheted at the
seeno and joined the excited parents,
who were screaming for somo one to
rescuo their boy. The flames were
mounting higher and higher.
Within a few .minutes after the explosion-
John Lozlo, former gangster,
who hit the sawdust trail at the Billy
Sunday meetings, and who is fighting
in tho courts for an appeal from a fit-teen-year
penitentiary sentence on a
robbery charge, dashed up In a motor
car. He rushed into tho house, In
quest of the boy. He did not find hint
but he rescued Mrs. Nick Cbarniello
and her baby.
Tho honor of tho boy's rescuo fell
to District Fire Chief Dan Donovan,
who chopped his way into the base
ment and found the boy in a mass of
water-soaked wreckage. He, too, was
cheered by Little Italy when he came
forth with the boy In his arms.
The lad was taken to the General
hospital and later removed to Wesley
hospital, where ho died as the result
of burns and Inhalation of flames.

BLOW UP NEWSPAPER PLANT
Dynamite Exploded Under Pre.tsea of
Menace at Aurora NoClew to
Perpetrators.
rnamrte was used In the effotts
to wreck tho plant of tho Menace Pub
lishing Cnmpan, publishers of nn
anti-Catholic paper, at Auroia early
tho other morning, according to
Charles Terry, sheriff of Lawrpuce
county, who made an examination of
t-io partially wrecked building. Sheriff
Terry declared that ho had found no
particles of metal to confirm beliefs
that a bomb had been used.
"From the holo blown In tho
ground beneath the presses dynamite
must have been used," ho said.
"Ashes from the flro that followed tho
explosion- and water throwji by the
flro department, however, prevented
a more complete examination."
No wires that might have connected
the chargo of dynamite with electri
cal batteries were found. The au
thorities apparently are without clews
as to the porpetratois of tho crime.
Three explosions beneath tho floor
of tho building occurred at 4:15
o'clock in tho morning. Tho first ex
plosion quickly followed by another,
occucrred bencatli a press which had
just completed tho Missouri edition of
the Menace. In four minutes there
was another explosion. Tho explos
ions set flro to the papers fresh from
tho folder, but the Aurora flro depart
ment extinguished the flames with
chemical apparatus.
It was ascei tallied that an cntranco
might havd been effected by means of
a window, a wooden gate of which
was found open. Other theories of
tho explosion nro being investigated,
one of thcra being that the shock
might havo been the result of spon
taneous combustion originating from
heat due to tho burning of refuse In
the furnace room by tho watchman.
A reward of $1,000 was offered by
Marlon Brown, editor of the Menace,
fpr tho arrest of tho person respousl
bio for the explosion.

Some folks say there is no science in growing the savory
fungus :: Others say there is, and prove it by their
success in the industry :: Perhaps you could have good luck
(115 St'CCESSFFUL cultiva
tion of mushrooms In Amer
ica has not been so general
us In most of the European
countries. It Is In France
nnil lu England that the
mushroom Industry has
been best developed. Franco
Is, properly speaking, tho
homo of the present mush
room Industry. Unusual In
terest has been shown In the United
States In the growth of mushrooms
within the past few years, and it Is to
be hoped nnd expected that within the
next ten years tho industry will de
velop to the fullest limit of the mar
ket demands. Tho latter will, of
course, lie .stimulated and developed
by the Increasing popular appreciation
of this product. In some cities and
towns there is already n good market
demand for mushrooms, while In oth
ers they mny be sold only directly to
special customers. This should be
borne in mind by prospective growers.
Success In mushroom growing de
pends on Intelligent study of condi
tions nnd on experience. While many
American growers hnvo been success
ful In the production of mushrooms, n
much larger number have failed. In
most cases failures have been due to
one or more of the following causes:
(1) The use of poor spawn, or of
spawn which has been killed by Im
proper storage.
(-') Spawning nt n temperature In
juriously high.
(3) Tho use of too much water
either nt the time of spawning or later.
(4) Unfavorable temperature dur
ing the growing period.
Mushrooms may bo grown In any
place whero tho conditions of tempera
ture and moisture are favorable. A
shed, cellar, cavo or vnennt space In
n greenhouse may bo utilized to ad
vantage for this purpose. The most
essential factor, perhaps. Is that of
temperature. The proper temperature
ranges from 53 degrees to 00 degrees
Fahrenheit, with the best from 55 de
grees to 58 degrees Fahrenheit. It Is
unsafe to attempt to grow mushrooms
on a commercial basis, according to
our present knowledge of tho subject,
nt u temperature much less than 50
degrees or greater than 03 degrees
Fahrenheit. Any severe changes of
temperature retard growth or else net
Injuriously, and many changes of tem
perature would entirely destroy the
profits of the mushroom crop. From
this It is evident that In many places
mushrooms may not be grown as a
summer crop. With artificial heat they
may be grown almost anywhere
throughout the winter. Moreover, It
Is very probable that In this country
open-air culture must bo limited to u
few sections, nnd restricted, conimer
chilly ut lenst, to a single season.
A second Important fnctor is that
of moisture. The place should not be
very damp, or constantly dripping
with water. Under such conditions
successful commercial work Is not pos
sible. A place where It Is posslblo to
maintain n fairly molt.t condition of
tho atmosphere, nnd having such
c-apnblllty for ventilation as will cause
nt least a gradual evaporation Is, by
general practice and by tho most ex
tensive experimentation, shown to bo
necessary. With too rapid ventilation
nnu tno consequent necessity or re
pented applications of water to the
mushroom bed no mushroom crop will
attain tho highest perfection,

of temperuturo and moisture be best
regulated. Cold Is less injurious to
mushroom beds than heat. Tho for
mer renders tho bed for n time unpro
ductive; but thu latter stimulates tho
spawn to too rapid growth, which is
usually followed by tho production of
unsalable mushrooms, or by the even
tual death of tho spawn, supposedly
by damping olr.
Mushrooms may often be grown In
n very simply constructed shed or un
used bam which will provide against
any sudden changes of thu tempera
ture, mid when It Is possible to employ

In the growing of mushrooms for
commercial purposes, the beds should
bo constructed of stable manure which
has been fermented or composted.
Many experiments have been made
looking' toward tho substitution of
other composts or waste products for
stable manure, but nothing has yet
been found which mny be moro highly
recommended. Fresh manure should
tic obtained, nnd this should Include
the litter used for bedding the ani
mals, unless the latter consists of
coarse weeds. It Is a great mistake.
In a commercial wny, to attempt to
use manure free from straw. Again,
stable manure which has been well
trampled Is nearly always well pre
served, nnd Is frequently much richer
than any other kind.
The mnnure should be piled In heaps
nbout three feet deep when well
pressed down with the fork, nnd these
plies may bo of considerable extent.
It should be wntered until well moist
ened throughout, but not drenched.
In the course of four or five days or a
week it will bo necessary to fork over
or "turn" tho manure. A second turn
ing will be required usually In from
seven to trn days, nnd It mny be neces
sary to water again If the material has
suffered considerable drying out. If
well pressed down nnd merely Juolst,
tho manure will not burn, nnd, more
over, there will bo no tendency for n
sour fermentation to become estab
lished. In from 15 to 21 days,

temperature will begin to fall, the
violence of decomposition will begin
to show n subsidence, and tho compost
will be ready for the construction of
the beds. The bacteria of rupld decay
will become less nnd less abundant,
and llnnlly, when the beds nre pre
pared ns subsequently described, tho
spawn will be able to grow lu spite of
tho bacteria present.
Mushroom beds are of two general
types (1) tho flat bed, nnd (2) tho
rldgo bed known ns the French type.
In making the former the entire Hour
spneo may be utilized ns a bed, or the
beds mny be nrranged In the form of
tiers or shelves. In low cellars or
caves and Indeed wherever the amount
of floor space Is not tho most Impor
tant consideration, It would bo well to
avoid the uso of shelves, but where
the amount of floor space Is an Impor
tant fnctor they may bo adopted to
udvnutage, although tho additional la
bor Involved In the growing of a crop
under such conditions ns nn item to be
considered. When shelves are used
ono should bo careful to whitewash
those after each crop In order to avoid
tho Increased danger from Insect dep
redations. In uny case, flat beds
should bo imidc from 8 to 10 Inches
deep.
Rldgo beds enable one to get a
somewhat greater surface spnee In a
given urea, but they nro also moro ex
pensive so far us the labor of construc
tion Is concerned. Nevertheless, they
are very desirable.
When a lied Is In full bearing, the
muslirooms should bo gathered nt least
once in two days, mid it Is well to
pick them every day, particularly If
tho temperature Is tip to 00 degrees
Fahrenheit or more. Picking Is Itself
an art, and the Intelligent grower will
soon find that tho yield of a bed may
be greatly lessened by lack of Judg.
ment In picking. To sutlsfy the gen

the loam removed by rubbing, but ex
cept In special cases this procedure Is
not to bo recommended. It Is not nec
essary to cut the stem off short, but
the market demands that there shall
be few long shanks.
For the best trndo It Is desirable to
"sort" tho mushrooms, placing only
those of nearly the snmo size In the
same packages. It Is certainly not
well to pack together "broilers" nnd

nro sometimes preferred.

Under favorable circumstances a
bed may come Into bearing within sir
weeks. It usually requires, however, a
longer period, nnd eight weeks may
more nearly represent the average
conditions. If tho conditions have been
variable, nnd especially If nt times a
very low temperature has prevailed,
bearing mny bo still further delayed.
Again, the period of production or the
profitable "life" of a successful bed
may vary greatly, ranging from flvo
weeks to us many months. As u rule,
a bed which produces fine, heavy
mushrooms will bear longer than one
which yields plants of lighter weight.
Many growers think that there Is
profit In n bed which yields ono-half
pound per square foot of surface urea.
Ono should not bo mitlstled with less
than this, nnd If the best conditions
prevnll this yield Is fur below what
should be obtained,
