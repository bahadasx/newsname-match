Roosevelt Applauds
Hughes9 Speech
Theodore Roosovelt sat tn a box at
Cnrnt't'lo Hull when Mr. Hughes de
livered hla unucch of acceptance and
vigorously upplauded every telllug
point. I
The Colonel repeatedly aroso and
bowed In response to the cheers for
him anil the shouts of "Toddy I" "Tcd
lyl" "Murruli for Teddyl", and when
the meeting adjourned he mado the
following btatcment:
"It Is an admirable spoech and I
irish to call attention to the following
poluts: I
"1 uin particularly pleasod with the
exposure of the folly, and worse than I
folly, of Mr. Wilson's Mexican policy I
and of the way In which this policy
has brought humiliation to tho United
States aiul disaster to Mexico Itself, i
"Moreover, 1 am very glad of the j
straightforward manner in which Mr.
Hughes haa shown tho ridicule with
which Mr. Wilson has covered this na
tion by the manner In which ho al
lowed foreign powers to gain the Im
pression that although ho usod tho
strongest words In diplomacy thoy
were not to be taken seriously.
Not Words Which Count
"As Mr. Hughes said, It is not words
but tho strength and resolution behind
tho words which count. As Mr.
Hughes pointed out, there is no doubt
that If Mr. Wilson's conduct and ac
tion had been such as to inako tho
foreign nations ballovo that he meant
prucleoly what ho said In his 'strict
accountability' there would have been
no destruction of American Uvea by
tho sinking of the Lusltanta.
"When Mr. Hughos uses strong
words his record shows that thoy are
always backed by strong deeds, and
theroforo In tho enormous majority of
cases the use of strong words renders
It unnecessary ever to havo recourse
to strong deeds.
"Again, Mr. Hughes speaks In char
acteristically straightforward fash
ion of tho outrages committed on mu
nitions plants, and all men, whether
citizens of foreign nations or nominal
cHWrtna of our own land, who had In
any shape or way abetted or condoned
thoso actions can understand that Mr.
Hughes, If Presldont, will protect
those domestic American interests and
punish offenders against them Mth
tho fearlessness and thoroughness
that he showed In dealing with tho
powers of evil at Albany.
Drought Nation to Ignominy.
"Just before coming In to listen to
Mr. Hughes' Just characterization of
Mr. Wilson's falluro to protect tho
lives and property of Americans In
Mexico and on tho high seas, I hap
pened to pick up John Flake's "Critical
Period of American History," and was
Btruck by tho following two sentences:
" 'A government touches the lowest
point of Ignominy when It confesses
Its Inability to protect the lives and
the proporty of Its citizens. A nov
eminent which has come to thlB has
failed In discharging tho primary func
tion of government and forthwith
ceases to havo any reason for exist
ing.' "Mr. Hughes has pointed out tn his
peoch with solf-rcBtralnt, but with
emphasis, that It Is precisely this
primary function which Mr. WllBon'c
Administration hns failed to discharge
and that It Is precisely this point of
ignominy to which ho has reduced
tho nation over which ho Is President."
A POLICY OF FIRMNESS AND
CONSISTENCY NEEDED.
Tho Nation has no policy of
aggression toward Mexico. We
havo no desire for any part of
her territory. We wish her to
have peace, stability, and pros
perity. Wo shall havo to adopt
a how policy, a policy of firm
ness and consistency through
which alone wo can promote an
enduring friendship. Wo de
mand from Mexico tho protec
tion of tho lives and tho prop
erty of our citizens and tho se
curity of our border from depre
dations. Much will bo gained
If Mexico Is convinced that we
contemplato no meddlesome In
terference with what does not
concern us, but that we propose
to Insist In a firm and candid
manner up tho performance
of International obligations. To
a stablo government, appropri
ately discharging Its Interna
tional duties, we should give un
grudging support A short perl
i nt firm, consistent and
$ friendly deallnt? will accomplish
i moro than many yean .r vacti

WILSON FLEXIBILITY.
Wc do not sou why tlmro should
havo heon any htlr la tho auiiuio oer
the discovery that I'rnsldmit WlUon
has completely ruvorBod hlmsolf In
tho matter of tho iironoscd ehlld labor
law. Senator llorah waa ablo to show
that Mr. Wilson described this IckIk
latlon In his "Constitutional Govern
mnnt" as iincotiMitulinnal, an "obvi
ouy absurd extravagance," carrying
tho conBreasslonal power (o ruKtilatu
commorco beyond tho "utmost boun
daries of reasonable and honest In
ference," and making It iiosslble, If
sustained, for congress to legislate
over "every particular of tho Indus
trial organization and action of the
country." That, wo nnpt confess, has
also been thu L't!iing Post's view.
Mut tho Evening I 'out and Senator
llorah are old fogies, dating back to
the time when It "us the custom to
havo fixed beliefs id principles and
stick to them. The bonator has evi
dently not read Mj. Wilson's letter In
explaining his chango of front on tho
tariff commission that It Is only a
narrow man, whoso mind Is stupidly
closed to now Idea, who doos not
ultor his opinions. By this tost. Mr.
Wilson Is obviously one of tho broad
