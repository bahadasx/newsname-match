Dear Friends:
Since- teavinjr" home for earvfnis
on the border, we have received manyi
requests to write, despite our present
life and environ men t.so here la where
the -World fom mm . rhiiw .
work over time.
- Our regiment left Ft. Rllev in five
sections scheduled one boor apart.
jacn section was made up of muni
tion cars, tourist sleenara and t.arr.
kitchen cars. We were on the road
three days and two niphts had
pieniy or wen cooked food and travel
ed all the way in safety and comfort.
This is more than the tooops from
ouiue states wno traveled as long as
nve days in day coaches without suf
ficient food, some say.
we traveled on the M. K. & T
through Parsons and Burlington,
Kansas, accross Oklahoma at night.
awakening in Texas. It is difficult
to realize that we traveled two days
ana a night in Texas. We stopped
occasionally for exercise which con
sisted of walking through the streets
oi uinerent cities. Dennison, Dallas.
Waco and San Antonio were the
most important places at which we
stopped.
Arriving at .Eagle Pass we were
greeted bv the 2nd regimental band
which, preceeded us here a week be
fore.
We marched to our cionn slkrht
without delay and proceeded to clear
the ground of cactus, stones aid
mesquit brush, not t j mention a few
centipedes and other insects.
Our camp is situated on a stretch
or low sandy eround surrounded nn
three sides by high rocky bluffs, on
the other side lies Eagle Pass and the
Rio Grande river.
The Hi st day in camp introduced us
to some of the hottest weather I
have ever experienced. Each day we
enjoy (?) a sand storm which is due
tp arrive at 4:50 , p. m. but like the
train- service at' home, it is some
tmes delayed, often catching us at
mess, "covering , our -"beans'. with
grit and other appetite reducers.
This? is the rainy season for this ;pait
of Texas and the daily dust storm Is
generally followed by a shower that
is appreciated to the fullest extent.
1 he Intense heat, dust storm and
insects of different kinds, including
reptiles of various sorts, give one an
inclination to become homesick.
Only this morning just before reveille.
x Kined a smau. snatte without mov
ing from my cot. This, however is
not.a common -occurrance. All these
things together with the daily rou
tine of army life, serve to harden us
for whatever we may be called upon
to do, especially for a campaign if
Mexico should become, menacing.
Notwithstanding the hardships we
enjoy many privileges. A large
regimental Y. M. C. A. tent has
been erected for our recreation, where
we may read and write, evervthinar
furnished free of charee. Shower
baths add to our comfort and we also
have electric lights and running
water, an allowance of ice each day
gives usice water at all times and
such delicacies as ice tea, lemonade
and even ice cream.
The city of Eagle Pass is . one mile
irom camp. It is a place of-about
12,000 inhabitants, fifty nercent of
whom are Mexicans and Spanish, the
other half refugees. The most prom
inent building In town is a hotel
three stories In height.
Just accross the river from Eagle
Pass is the Mexican town Pedras
Negras Mexican -for- black -rock
a place of -of about 15,900 inhabitants
ot which we now little about. .
' A large garrison of Carranzasoldiers
are stationed there and the report
is that they have several six inch
guns trained on this camp. How
ever our own artillery isn't here for
nothing and the greasers have noth
ing on ns so "we should worry"
Accfoss the Rio Grande and con
necting the two cities is the inter
nation bridge. This bridge is con
stantly guarded and all persons
crossing are searched before allowed
to pass. ...,"
It was my rood fortune to be on a
fruard detailed to watch the bridirn
and one sees many interesting things
in the course of a day on guard there.
We have also been on guard at the
power plant, pumping station and
pasbenger depot there.
Our company was one of the. first
to relieve the regulars . on outpost
duty, so it happened that soon -after
our coming here we were sent 'from
camp about ten 'miles to relieve
regulars ffnardina.' an nlri

noto was some signaling oyer in the

There are about 12,000 soldiers of
the K. G. in camp here and about
2,000 regular U. S. soldiers.. Regi
ments from Kansas, Vermont, Mary
land and New York compose camp
Sohafer. Troops rom Colorado and
Virginia are also expected to join us
soon.
No one knows how long we will be
here and not many of us care. If we
return home we will be better men
physically and trained for any future
emergency. Although newsDaner re
ports point toward early peace, the
activity of the war department as
seen nere has altogether a different
meaning. We know less about real
conditions as thev exist in Mexico
than any one else, perhaps, so won't
argue that point.
