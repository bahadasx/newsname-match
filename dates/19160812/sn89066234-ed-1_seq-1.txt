Strike Probable.
Vote of 400,000 Railway Employes is
Overwhelming: for Standing: Pat.
Washington, Aug. 0. The exer-

ference eoniiiiittce ot the roads
have agtced to a resumption of

August H. according to Informs

The melon belt or Southeast

Interested in the probable general
strike of the railway employes
until just now. Melons are bring
ing reeord-breaking prices, and
a suspension of railroad traffie
would "hurt business."
The counting of the stike vote
is finished ant! showed that the
men are almost unanimously in
favor of a strike unjess their de
mands for an eight-hour day and
time and a half for over-time are
ir ranted. Press reports say that
trom 98 to per eent of the men
have so voted.

Washi: zton. Auj: .. me latge
ailrouds of the nation have just
closed their books on the most
i.i,usierous year recorded in their
history, according to figures b.v
the interstate commerce commis
sion. This year the roads earned
aver s-MUU for every mile of road
operated, or saoo.uou.ooo In ex-
ess of former years
Recently 1 received a eommuni
satton from an uinio railway em
ploye enclosing copy of u mislead
ing advertisement put out by the
i allroad managers, and whicli ap
peared in some of our count.v pa
pers. Writing of an editor who bad
published this advertising matter
the employe says that the editor
is "largely dependent upon rail
way men for support, and that
the' men who today advertise m
his paper are largely dependent
upon these knights of the road
for support. What would happen
to the editor if the railroad men
decided to withdraw their sub
scriptions, and then go to the
merchants and say, "If you ad
i.. rt.se in the 1 am cutting
out my trade with J'OUi
To this there is but one answer.
The editor could not digest his
fiee pass. If the workers would
refuse to patronize any newspa
per, or any business, that news
paper or business would have to
close up shop. 1 recognized this
fact years ago. and have built the
Kicker upon the working class.
Aud it is because of this working
class foundation that all of the
efforts of the landlords and bank
ers, and their priests, preachers
and politicians, to destroy the
Kicker have been fruitless altho'
Often very unscrupulous. The
working class is IT, but the trou
ble lies in the fact that the work
ers do not know their power,
ii is the workers that support
all of the newspapers, as well
as all else. Vet all of the news
papers, except the Labor and So
cialist press, are owned or con
trolled by the capitalist class and
published in their interest.
However, from a business point
-) view, there is nothing wrong
in a newspaper carrying au ad
vertisement for the railroads. A
newspaper is in business to make
money just the same as the han
ker, the merchant, the saloon
keeper or the minister. Cut ouv
the profit and you cut out the
whole capitalist w orks including
salvation."
And there is profit in advertis
ing, if you get the money even
from a railroad. It is a queer ex
perience for a OOUUtry editor to
be offered CASH for railroad ad
vertising. He usually gets only
free rides. But the installments
of dope that are now being sent
out by the railroads are paid for
iu cash at least some of them
are. 1 know, for 1 have some of
their junk here in the shop.
It works this way: One week
they send an advertisement for
which they pay from $2 to S3
Plate matter is furnished. No
type to set.
The next week comes more
plate matter, accompanied, by a
nice, personal letter from the
managers explaining that it is
not an advertisement, but "news
matter." The editor is warned
that he is under no obligations to
print it, but that if he does. It
will be highly appreciated by ye
managers,
Ye editor understands. That
railroad "mileage" looms up be
fore him like a war map. And he
prints the stuff without charge,
About three months ago the
railway managers had their press
agents to prepare "editorials" to
be printed in the kept newspapers
of the nation. Alter these edito-
lials appeared, the managers had
them printed in pamphlet form
and sent out broad-cast to pfOVI
thut public opinion is unfavorable
to the demands of the railway
employes. Of this trick the Mil
waukee Leader says:
"First make your 'public opinion
Then quote it to prove you are
light. This Is the method used
by the railroad managers in op
posing the eight hour day,
tor several weeks the press has
been subjected to a regular cur
tain of fire' in the form of ready
made railroad editorials, Ail the
papers that dance to railroad
music have been tr.ving these edi
torials on their readers.
.Now the Association of Western
Railways compiled some 150 ol
these machine-made editorials in
to a pamphlet and sent it out to
the press to show that "public
opinion" is opposed to the eight
hour day.
As might be expected from such
a standardized product there is
much sameness in the output,
Nearly all quote the same figures
to show the poverty of the rail
loads, all weep lor the "dear pub
lic " and threaten that increased
wages will mean Increased rates
Financial America and The
j Railway Age Gazette rise to a
suspiciously similar level of in
dignation. The first is frightened
at the possibility o: a strike while
the L'uropean war continues and
w at us the railroad workers that
'treasonable opportunism is an
appropriate term or such an at
titude," The Gazette pictures a
possible war with Mexico and con
cludes: this would be u mighty
poor time for a strike : and to call
it under such conditions would be
little short of treason.
The Chicago Herald holds out
the irighttul prospect that "capi
tal may refuse to work for wages
deemed inadequate. Labor has no
monopoly of the strike." Tne
horrible possibility of ail the
capitalists in the country taking
their capital and going off into
the garden to eat worms while
the people suffer is too terrible to
contemplate.
The Chicago Tribune and The
Iron Tradesman drag out the
threat Ol government ow nership.
"1; the engine and trainmen
should win their point it would
be but another step tow aid a gen
eral breakdown, that would mean
eventual government ownership,"
says The Tradesman. The Trib
une goes a step farther and tells
the prospective strikers: "Govern
ment ownership of the railroads
will take away from the employ
es the right to strike."
but the dominant note, the liet
nititif of the whole chorus, is
that tile poor public is about to
suffer. This is probably true
Most of the public are members
of the working class ami they are
continually soaked for all that the
traffic will bear. Therefore they
should not worry much about
anything more the railroads can
do to them,
If there w as an additional pen
ny that the railroads could have
obtained from any source they
would iiave gone after it long ago
During the iflst half century they
have grabbed everything loose
and plenty of things that were
supposed to be locked up and nail
ed down.
If the workers in other line of
industry can get the wealth they
are prouuemg sua mi is iacu
away from them by their em
ployers they need not be disturb
ed at the threats to raise rail
road rates.
The attention of those who
compiled the pamphlet of editor
ials should be called to the fact
that they di d not include any
quotation from The Leader.
The Railroad Managers have
lepeated the statement that
their employes are asking for a
raise so often that they act as if
they believed it them selves. The
newspapers have printed the
same story in advertisements and
ready-made editorials until some
of the editors have forgotten
when the story was invented.
The Chicago Herald begins an
editorial with the calm assump
tion that, "the leaders of the
train service unions have notified
the iailway managers that on
Aug. 8 they will be ready to re
sume negotiations about the 65
per cent increase in wages de
manded by the uuions."
No one would guess from such a
sentence that the employes had
never mentioned wages in their
demands, and that no negotia
tions on wages had ever been pro
posed or discussed.
Having made this statement
without a blush or a riot, The
Herald then urges arbitration by
the interstate commerce Commis
sion because of the possibility Of
that body "being able to find the
money for wage increases of
about siuo.ooo.ooo a year."
It is easy to write that sen
tense. Few people reading it will
know that it lias no relation to
the facts. It sounds Just as goo I
as though it was true.
.lust to keep the record from
wandering too far from reality
it might be well to remind The
Herald, and numerous other pa
pers that the railroad men have
not said any tiling about wages
.They only ask for an eight-hour
day.
.WHERE IGNORANCE 1 BLISS,
The more ignorant a fellow is
of political methods, the better
he is fitted to turn the crank of a
nolitlcal organ. If he doesn't
i know any better, he is not dis
turbed by his conscience When
putting out the regulation dope
However. Editor Purecll of the
lllmo Jitnplieute has been in the
harness a long time, and he is
beginning to see things as they
really are, Occasionally he "boils
over" and says things that a
good' Democrat ought not to
say,
A "good'' Democrat always de
rends "the party, which, when
boiled down, means defending tin

or lose standing as a "good"

Of course Rolla We. Is. Dave

did ill 1S00, and it does not inter
fere with their Democratic lead
ership at all. but tne Hubes must
stand hitched. "So all you little
Democrats might as well hitch
up" to use the language ol Edi
tor Purcelt.
"The big boss done spok."
THEY ML'UDEHED HIM.
Yes. they hung Sir Roger Case
ment, the Irish patriot, as a trai
tor. Perhaps he was a traitor to
the powers that be. but not to
humanity. He gave Ids life in at,
effort to free Ireland. And. be
lieve tne, he will live in history
ages after the tinseled murderers
who condemned him to death un
der a 15th century statute are
rotten and forgotten.
He was the George Washington
of Ireland. He headed the revolt
against English oppression, but
the priest-ridden Irish peasants
did not understand, and listen
ed to their priests. The rebellion
failed.
Sir Itoger was shot because he
had taken up the cause of his op
pressed people, being of "royal"
blood himself, the ruling class of
England could not forgive al
though apiH'als and protests
against his murder were sent to
the English powers from all over
the world.
Had Washington failed in his
rebellion agninst the English
crown, he would also have died as
a "traitor" instead of the Father
of his country.
There is an almost invisible line
that divides the patriot from the
ttaitor. It all depends on the
turn of fortune. Had the slave
owners been successful in the six
ties, history would read entirely
different. Jeff Davis would, aji
pear as the hero and Lincoln as
the traitor.
it is the ruling class of the time
that writes history.
RURAL CREDITS.
Last week I noticed a great
deal of stuff in the newspapers
ebout the president having signed
a rural credits law. I don't know
what there is in the new law, nor
does it matter. The evident In
tention of it is a bait to eaten
rural votes, and will be used by
6pell-binders as proof that the
fanner was not over-looked by
congress.
The truth is that no permanent
relief can tome to the masses so
long as the capitalists are in con
trol of government Rural, nor
any other kind of credit, will help
those who have nothing to offer
as security, and the lew w ho y et

but let's look at matters neater
home. Pemiscot county Is one of
the richest counties in this end of
the state and developed very rap
idly. Like Scott county, it ha
its "w orthy citizens" anil its pan
pens. Like Scott county, it has
no funds and is paying six per
cent interest on its county war
rants because its "most affable"
officials looted tne county trees i
ry. Says the caruthersville Re
publican :
"It has reached a i oittt in Pem
iscot county when the inmates of
the county farm have been dump
ed into the streets of Caruthers
ville to live or die, eat or starve,
deluding upon the charity of the
citizens. The statement sounds
incredible, but last Monday morn

farm, hauled to this city and
turned loose. There is a man.
blind for 30 years and his invalid
wife; another man. drawn atid
twisted by rheumatism, ga .:.t
and ill-looking, and his wife, who
is plainly below par. mentally,
an d w ho is soon to become a
mother, and another man suffer
ing from blood poisoning in his
feet, patt of which have been
amputated. They were not given
any clothes, except such as
they wore. They have managed
to secure a few nickels and dimes
for a bed and some food, and their
days are spent sitting on a bench
iu the Methodist church lawn.
Why is this, you ask? "No
funds," is the answer given by the
three judges who comprise the
County Court and by the wife of
the superintendent of the county
farm, bought for a home lor our
poor, and valued at 110,000.
Warrants, which draw ii per cent
interest can no longer be cashed
and so Mr. Thompson refused to
keep them. What a state of af
fairs for a county rated as one
of the richest in the great State!
What a disgrace to humanity
What are we to do with these
poor, sick, blind, feeble people, and
what will become of this woman
soon to become a mother?"
Yep. That is what is puzzling
the plutes. "Vhat are we to do
with these poor, sick, blind, feeble
people?"
As for the prisons, the plutes
thought they had it fixed wheu
they adopted the parole system
There are probably more people
on the parole than in the pen.
Yet the pen is crowded to its ca
pacity and the governor is forced
to pardon them in droves in order
to make room for new arrivals.
In Pemiscot county 04 persons
are confined in a jail built for
16 during this hot weather.

RABBI WISE OS MILITARISM,
Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, of New
York, in addressing the City Club
of St. Louis, made this true re
mark, which every war-craity,
would-be patriot and militarist
should paste in his hat and read
It at least twice every morning
until the end of the present war
Rabbi WLte said. ' The adage, 'In
time of peace prepare for war,' is
the most blasphemous lie ever of
fered as a reason for prepared
ness and permanent peace. Did
not Europe prepare for war? Is
Europe at peace? W'e have been
at peace with England for 100
years, but there is not a cannon
on the Canadian boundary. If
Great Britain had maintained a
great fleet on the Great Lakes,
do you suppose we would have re
mained at peace throughout a
century?" St. Louie Labor.
