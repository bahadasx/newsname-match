Made by Senator Chilton's

is at Home III.
WASHINGTON, August IN?As a
sample of "senatorial courtesy." as
well as the oilier kind, as Interpreted
by United States Senator William IS.
Chilton, West Virginians In the capital
aro standing agluiKl at the Insinuating
attack he permitted his prds agent
1 to make on his distinguished colleague,
j Senator Nathan (luff who, for over a
' month now, lias liten confined to his
home hi Clarksburg with a serious
attack of illness.
The article which lias shocked West
Virginians here as about the meanest
and most discourteous, not to say underhand
fling that one senator could
aim at another, anil the one timed at
bedridden with Illness, was a yarn
about a pension bill for the relief of a
West Virginia woman, Introduced by
| Congressman Noel!' in tue .Mouse, lining
missing from Hie hatch of pension
bills reported from the Senate com-,
mittee for passage. The story went on 1
' reciting that had Senator Uoff been
present he could have seen to putting i
the bill in. but he was not and'Senator
Chilton, who was in one of the ante
l rooms, his attention being called to it
came onto the floor and had the bill
j inserted in the report thus "saving a
pension for a poor West Virginia
woman," etc. Tills doesn't begin to;
convey the Insinuating Insults which
j the article contained, but It Is sutllcicnt
to indicate the character of the j
screed.
Had Senator Gollbeen well and able
1 to be present on the occasion com- [
\ plained of, lie would not have known
i any more about this particular bill
than any other one to which his at-1
[ tention had not been specifically called \
There Is nothing In the bills or the
report of them which indicates whore
the proposed beneficiaries reside. lio
| sides, this was a House bill introduced
tijp Congressman Neoly, a Democrat,
it is the Senate custom that bills of
this kind introduced by Democratic
congressman, when passed by (ho
j House arc to he loosed arter r>y ucni|
ocratlc senators, from the same states |
as the congressmen when possible, or.
I by Senate friends from other states
when that arrangement isn't possible,
i Then, the senator knows only about
what he is expected to look after when
: his attention is specifically called to it,
| the underling he hastened to the rcsI
cue, and not satisfied with the false
and fulsome flattery of himself from '
his publicity agent, falls to censor ori
delete a ease and covert attack upon
his distinguished colleague, whose
long-continued illness no one knows
better about than he.
I In the pension business which forms
: so large and so conspicuous a "bunk"
' and then ninety-nine times out of 100 |
his secretary attends to it. It is stooi
small a matter and too routine to re-1
quire his spending any time over It.
It is about a hundred to one shot thut
Senator Chilton did not know anything!
about the pmmlsslon of this particular
bill, propably never heard of its ex-i
Istence until his attention was called'
to it by some secretary whose employe I
had a political interest In seeing It
go through, but probably himself never
had heard of It. But upon word from
"back In the dee-strict," Senator Goff's <
' office has efficiently and surcessiuiiy
1 looked after the hills from the House
1 which were introduced by the RcpubliI
can representatives from West VIr-,
| gtnla. in addition to the bills lntroI
dttced hy Senator Ooff himself. He
] hasn't any more to do with a Xcely or
a Dittlepage bill than he has to do
with any other Democrat's bill. In
saving the Neely hill as to boastlngly
and Insultingly narrated. Senator Chilton
did only what he Is expected to do
by his Democratic colleagues In the.
House. Senator Doff has time and
again saved a hill of a Republican col!
league from West Virginia in the
House, but he wniutn't stand for any ;
cheap advertisement being made of It.1
It is what Is expected of him, what he
is there for and what is done.

are naylng that he ih a fortunate
young man and that all signs point
to the goddess of fortune showering
gold upon In such quantities that ho
need never more worry from whence
Is coming the next meal. Mr. Lively
Is a railroad man by occupation
and an Inventor by Inclination. Ho
has Invented a mail crane which does
all the work that tho present ancient
cranes do without destroying lives
of railroad men and mai^ pouches,
which In the aggregate constitute a
eum total of valunliel government
property.
Furthermore, the postctfiyio department
is on the point of adopting tho
IJvely safety mall crane, which Is its
registered title. It has already been
approved and recommended by tho
first officials who put It to test, and
their -reports are now cnroute up tno
line of postal authorities for perusal,
Investigation and their O. K. That
Is the particular business which occasions
Mr. Llvely's presence In
Washington at this time.
The first railroad to Install the
Lively crano will bo the Virginian,
which starts at tidewater and runs
Into Southern West Virginia, a main
line of about 300 miles. The only
crane of Its kind Is In existence on
that road. It Is the first and onfy
one built, and It Is the one which has
been tested by poBtofllce officials,
railroad men and the Tnventor. It
made a record of missing only twlco
out of sixty times at all rates of
speed from four to sixty miles an
hour, and on a curve. It has caught
a mall bag containing containers
filled with eggs without breaking a
single one of them. There Is no mutilation
of pouchos. Tho arm of the
crane swings In tho direction the
train Is traveling, and It clears any
engine by five feet, swinging only
when the trap Is sprung by the
trucks of the mall car. The pouch
Is hooked by the same contrivance
on the mat Icar which Is now In general
uso. One of theso cranes can be
Installed for approximately $26.
The right kind of a mall crane has
been the objeot of search of postal

this West Virginian turned up with I
his device which met the require- ,
meats of the situation. The avidity
with which ull theeo interests have B
seized hold of the Lively patent I
seems to indicate that tlhelr long' \
Bcurch has been rewarded. :'B
The portal authorities have been B
Interesied in finding a device which - B
would do the work elllclently with- B
out the destruction of property- - |
pouch . The government's bill tor
new pouches and repairing partly destroyed
ones Is enormous. There > >
are 80,000 ot these pouches In the .vH
"hospital" ot the postofflce depart- v H
ment now receiving treatment.
