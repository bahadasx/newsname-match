WAR SUMMARY.
With rapid strides the Russians are
forcing their way along the Dniester
In Galicia in the direction of Halicz,
one of the main outlying defenses of
Lemberg, on the south.
Gen. Letchitzsky's army has already
reached the Dniester to the south of
I Mariampol, a town only eight miles
southeast of Halicz. Likewise, they
are pressing toward Halicz, further
north, entering the town of Monaster
zyska on the Stanislau-Buczacz rail
road, directly east of Halicz.
Spreading out in fanlike formation
from Gozia, the Italians are pressing
the Austrians to the east and south
east along a twelve mile front. The
principal thrust is apparently directed
southeast toward Trlest.
British pressure on the Somme front
Is being continuously exerted against
the Germans in the Bazentin-le-Petit
and Pozieres regions and Gen. Haig's
forces havfe made additional progress
north of both these places, London an
nounces.
The French in the Somme region
are evidently preparing for a new of
fensive movement as they are pour
ing a destructive fire upon the German
trenches north of the river.

Paris, Aug. 11.—"Entering Gorizia
by the Via Leone, the sight that meets
the eye is most striking," telegraphs
the Petit Parisien's correspondent on
the Isonzo front. "It was here that
a furious battle was fought for posses
sion of the city. The houses are half
destroyed by shells or riddled with
bullets.
"The ground 1b strewn with bod
ies, uniforms, helmets and rifles. The
artillery duel continued above our
heads and enemy aeroplanes whirled
across the sky, shot at by our gunners,
while in the distance could be heard
the furious clacking of machine guns.
"The spectacle before us was su
perb. Over, an iron bridge our batter
ies passed at a trot. The Austrian ar
tillery sent towards them whirlwinds
of shells, the smoke from which com
peltely blotted out our columns from
time to time. When the smoke blew
away one could see the batteries still
proceeding on their triumphant way.
The men of the line regiments yelled,
wept and clapped their hands in their
enthusiasm. Some of the gunners fell
wounded but the bridge was passed
and our guns began to get near the
enemy.
"As soon as one passed the first
houses and got into the city the as
pect of things changed completely.
Normal life was resuming its course
and if it had not been for the echoes
of the struggle, one would not have
known that a battle was In progress
nearby.
"In the Carso, one of the principal
streets, a big cafe was open, filled
with officers, soldiers and civilians, the
troops and citzens fraterizing freely
in their joy. Our flags floated from
the windows of all the houses.
"The population has almost all re
turned. The Austrians forced the in
habitants to leave the city itself but
they remained scattered throughout
the environs of the place awaiting the
retreat of the enemy to make their
way back."

DEATH SENTENCE
FOR STRIKERS IN
MEXICAN CAPITAL
ELECTRICAL WORKERS CHARGED
WITH TREASON IN STOPPING
MUNITIONS WORK.
El Paso, Tex., Aug. 11.—The text ot
a decree wherein First Chief Carranza
evoked the death penalty agalnBt the
strikers who paralyzed Mexico City
through a general electric strike, ap
pears in copies arriving here today of
El Pueblo, a daily published In the
capital.
In tying up transportation, plunging
tlie city in darkness and cutting off its
water supply, the strike is held by
Carranza to be no strike at all, but an
extent of pure treachery agalnBt his
government whose enemies will re
ceive encouragement by it.
Carranza's decree amplifies the law
of 1862, dealing with public disorders.
It threatens with death those connect
ed in any way with the strike. Not
only are those who preside at strike
meetings, advocate strike or persuade
others from working, either by elo
quence or threats, amenable to thiB
act, but even those who fail to leave
strike meetings on learning the sub
ject.
The strike was declared «on July 31
by the Confederation of Syndicates.
The paper, dated August 3, gives a
list of the leaders then in prison on
the charge of rebellion. It is said that
the strike was assisted by North Amer
ican syndicates and that It stopped
work in arms and munition factories,
which was construed as treachery to
the de facto government.
BREMEN BELIEVED
OFF SANDY ROOK
N^w York, Aug. 11. —Wireless ob
servers were puzzled early today by
signals received from an unidentified
vessel apparently somewhere off San
dy Hook which was calling the Tele
funken wireless station in this city.
The fact that the stranger refused to
discldse the identity of the vessel led
some of the wireless operators to be
lieve they were at last In communicar
tion with the German submarine Bre
men.
Sandy Hook observers trained their
marine glasses seaward at daybreak
but no submarine was In sight. The
mysterious signals had ceased.
While in communication with shore
stations a few hours earlier the vessel
reported herself only as a collier and
the operator on board signed his calls
"DBU," which is the .private wireless
signal of the North German Lloyd
steamer Breslau, last reported as tied
up in New Orleans for the period of
the war.
CALLS HELD FAKE.
New York, Aug. 11.—The wireless
signals picked up at Sandy Hook early
today, which it was first thought might
possibly be from the German undersea
freighter, Bremen, later were attribut
ed to some amateur operator by of
ficials of the Atlantic Communication
Co., operators of the so-called Tele
funken system.
This conclusion was reached after
wireless operators at all government
and shipping stations inland around
New York bay had tried fruitlessly for
hours to locate the sender. The calls
were for the "Telefunken station, New
York.

NTO THE WEST
PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO GO
AS FAR AS THE PACIFIC COAST
TO SPEAK.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 11.—Presi
dent Wilson practically has decided
to make a speaking trip across the
continent. No details of the tour have
been arranged but it Is understood to
day that his itinerary will be worked
out within the next few week*.
The president's advisers have been
urging him to make a number of
speeches but he has been withholding
a decision until the work of congress
had progressed further. If present
plans are carried out the president
will go to the Pacifio coast.
Senator Phelan today Invited the
president to speak In California some
time during the campaign btft was told
no definite plans could be taken up
for at least two weeks.
One of the suggestions for the pro
posed trip is for the president to re
view some of the troops on the border
but no decision on that has been
reached.
Invitations from cities In all parts
of the country are being sent the presi
dent, but none will be accepted un
til they have been gone over carefully
by Vance McCormlck, chairman of the
democratic national committee, and
other democratic leaders.
The possibility that congress may
remain In session after September 1
Is preventing the president from mak
ing any definite campaign plans. He
wants to make no long trips from
Washington until after adjournment,
although he has accepted an Invita
tion for a brief visit to St Louis, Sep
tember 20.
HUGHES IS HOARSE.
Fargo, N. D., Aug. 11.—Charles E.
Hughes left Fargo early today on a
revised schedule that will enable him
to deliver an evening address at Bil
lings, Mont., tonight
The strain of campaigning has seri
ously affected the nominee's voice,
which was so hoarse at times during
his speech here last night that he had
to stop frequently for a few seconds
at a time. Mr. Hughes is trying to
overcome the hoarseness by not talk
ing on the train except when imperar
tive.
The ride across the North Dakota
plains to the Montana line was brok
en by a series of short stops. The
first of these was at Bismarck for ten
minutes. At Mandan and at Dickin
son two minute stops are on the
schedule. At Medora, where Theo
dore Roosevelt spent part of his early
life on a ranch, a five minute stop is
to be made. Two minute stops are
scheduled at Glendive, Miles City and
Forsythe, Mont. The party is due at
Billings at 7:30 tonight

The statement was made in answer
