THE CITY.
New Iberia, the parish seat of Iberia
Parish ,the capital city of the Teche and
the metropolis of the Land of Evange
line, is in the hear of what has long
been known as one of the rieftest agri
cultural sections of Louisiana.
The city has a population of some
8000 inhabitants and is located on the
Southern Pacific Raikoad, 126 miles
west of New Orleans. It is also served
by the New Iberia and Northern, the
Iberia and Vermilion and the Franklin
and Abbeville Railroads, while a branch
road takes you to Avery Island. Sit
uated on the banks of the famous Ba
you Teche, a navigable stream at all
times of the year, it enjoys good water
way transportation. Indeed few cities in
Louisiana enjoy as excellent travel and
transportation facilities as does New
Iberia; and as a consequence, generally
low rates prevail.

the :
An electric trolley line system con
nects New Iberia with its sister city
of Jeanerette, located in the eastern part
of the parish. A model automobile
highway connecting the two cities,
parallel« the interurban and the Teche.
With an excellent system of highways
permeating every section of the Parish,
travel by land is indeed pleasurable.
While considerably dependent npon
the agricultural resources of the sor
rounding country, numerous factories
are operating within the confinés of the
city. For instance in New Iberia and
immediate vicinity are to be fonnd auch
factories as sogar, rice, cotton gins
creamery, lumber mills, tabasco factor
ies, canning factories, feed mill, corn
•levators, foundry and machine shops,
sash, blind and door factories, box fac
tory and ice factory.
The electric light and water worhs
of the city are municipally owned, and
the people at a recent election have juat
voted a ninety thouaand dollar bond ie
•ue for sewerage.
The hotel facilities of New Iberia
equal these of any city of this sise and
the Creole coffee made in this town is
said to be the best in the world.
New Iberia is under the commission
form of government and the preferen
tial system of voting is in vogue. Both
systems are working satiafactorily.
THE PAKISH.
Probably no county in the union
preaents auch diversified agricultural
possibilities. Almost in the heart of
the great cane belt, Iberia aoil has long
been famed for ita wonderful fertility.
Indeed so laviahly endowed by nature
hae the land of this section been, with
■n almoat inexhaustible supply of food
elements, sunshine and bountiful and
well diatributed rainfall, that in spite
of the years of tilling, it is no egaggera
tion to say that not one per cent, of the
acreage of this parish has ever been
treated with commercial fertilizers. Nat- '

urally some of.these lands are more vir
gin than others, and especially rich in
this land in nitrogen.
In Iberia is to found growing-great
fields of sugar cane, cotton, corn, fields
of truck, potatoes, tobasco peppers, oats,
' r
lespedeza, pastures of forage crops,
i vetch, clovers, Berumda, etc., and beauti
! , , .
: ful groves of fruit and pecans.
Formerly sugar cane was the leading
. , . . i rp , j- .•
industry by far. Today diversification is
the order of the day. The one-crop sys
j „
tem is a thing of the past and a new
agricultural era is dawning. Hand in
hand with diversification is the rapidly!
developing live stock, dairy and swine
in^nctrv
wdustry.
With the repeal of the free sugar
clause of the tariff bill the sugar indus
try will proceed with more stability and
certitude, but the people of the parish
will never revert to the one-crop system
again. The cane crop of 1910 had a
value of some two and
half million
dollars.
Corn does well in this parish and
with the advent of the silo and cattle
industry the acreage is being greatly in
creased, while many farmers raise corn
to be shipped to foreign markets.
Rice has developed great prominence
in the parish of late years, there being
something like 7,000 a;res planted to
rice in 1915. The yield averages about
12 to 14 sacks containing from 180 to
l"" 1 p'uids to the sack.
Since the advent of the boll weevil,
cotton has never regained the prom
inence it once held, but considerable cot
ton is still Taised. Cow peas, the clov
ers, vetch, oats and various forage crops
make a most wonderful growth on these
fertile soils. The clovers, vetch and
lespedeza are to be found growing wild.
Tabasco pepper growing has become
an important industry, the yield being
from 30 to 50 bushels per acre, worth
from $4.00 to $5.00 per bushel. Some
thing like 800 arces are devoted to this
crop. These peppers are grown for
manufacture Into various condiments,
the principal of which being tabasco
sauce. The Mr^Ilheny sauce manufac
tared at Avery Island in the parish,
known the world over.
Being unusually nitrogenous, the
Mil is adainMjr. adapted to tracfe,
especially these artielea requiring
great deal of nitrogen. The average for
aweet potatoes is from 50 to ISO barrels
to the acre. This seema to be the home
•f the fig, pecan and native orange. The
fig rarely a failure and huge quantities
of pecans are ahipped annually. Along
Bayou Teche can be found thousands of
pesan trees. At Avery Island alone there
are 14,000 fig trees of the Celeste and
500 of the Magnolia.
There is no greater livestock country
in America. In a land where crops
* so luxuriantly and where vegeta
tion is so rank; in a country where
cattle can grase out in the open for
twelve months in the year, cattle can be
raised here as economically as any
where, and maybe more so. Dipping
vats have ben eatabiiahed in every ward
in the pariah and in a few montha the
pariah will be declared t'ck free. The
Federal government has recently es
tablished a five hundred acre atock dem
onstration farm in the parish and great
many thoroughbred herda of short horn
and Hereforda are aeen here, while the
dairy industry is already a wel estab
lished and paying industry. Milk is
shipped to New Orleansa nd the local
creamery.
The cultivated area of the pariah is
not subject to overflow and there is not
farm in the pariah over four m ilea
from rail or water ahipping pointa, an
advantage few counties of the South
have.

' The timber area of the parish abounds
in inexhaustible hardwood with some
sypress left, while two of the largest
pure rock salt mines in the world are
at Avery's ad Weeks' Islands, both in
tili parish. With its nuaie.ccs streams,
bayous and lakes, fish and game are
plentiful in Iberia. In fact Mayor
Sealy tells us that they keep a lake—
Spanish Lake—right on the outskirts of
the city, just for such occasions as a
Mayor's convention, and from which
they procure the most deliciously-flav
ored fish to be found anywhere and
cooked in a manner to please the most
exacting epecurean. It is predicted that
after a trial at this festive board, many
a Mayor will regretfully leave bis seat,
forever afterwards, a devoult worshipper
at the shrine of Neptune. Furthermore,
Furthemore, his honor, Mayor Sealy,
guarantees these fish to be ptomine- a
P r °of.
Two of the largest game preserves in
the world are located in this parish—the
Mcllhenny preserve at Avery Island, and a
the Russell Sage preserve at Marsh Is
land. j
The climate ia ideal. There is never
any very cold nor any very hot weather, ,
for bordering on the Gulf, the same
br eeze that fans and cools Iberia in
summer, brings warmth to it in winter,
The mean annual temperature is 68 de
grees, F. in twenty yeara. The higheat
temperature recorded ia 101 degreea F.
and the lowest 6 degreçp,^ The mean
precipitaÜo n for 24 yeara is 55 1-2 inches
snd the rainfall ia uaualy wel distributed.
This section if best described by Long
he
fellow when ha says:
"Here no hungry winter congeals our
blood like the rivers.
Here no stony ground provokes the
wrath of the farmer.
I
Smoothly the plowshare runs through j
the soil aa a keel through the water,
All the year roend orange groves sre in
blossom; and grass grows
More i n a single night than a whole Ca
nadian summer."
SCENERY.
Few sectiona of thia State preaent
ao rich and varied a scenery aa doea
Iberia Parish. Bayou Teche with ita
moss-covered oaka, made famoua by the
immortal Longfellow, still stirs the soul
with the aplendor and grandeur of its
history and the richnea of its beauty.
The beautiful home of the farfamed
Joe Jefferson on Orange Island is full
of besuty and interest to the visitor,
and ao is the scenery on Avery Island.
On every aide nature revala ita greatest
magnificence, and mid the glory of these
patrichal moss-draped oaka are some
of the most beautiful of old Southern
homea.
From New Iberia it ia only a few
minutea ride to the Gulf, to the Joe
Jefferson home, to the salt mines and to
the game preserves.
Rich in song and story, rich in the
abundance of its natural resources, rich
in scenery and rich in the fam« of es
tablished hospitality, Iberia Pariah offers
unusual advantages to the home seeker,
the sight-seer, the investor; and we may
imagine what may be offered the League
of Municipalities in their 1917 conven
tion.

Why this district has such a
good school and Slicll a superb

the fact that it has been for a
long tillie the CUStoill of the school
patrons to meet two or three
finies a Ve .'ir diserss plans for
school improvement, sift out
ideas, decide Oil tile liest, and
then act as Olle man ill going
after what the majority wanted.
The chairman of the local school
Committee «-ailed these patrons'
meetings—aild We commend his
excellent example to other llien ill
similar positions. It 's a fine way
for Mr. Committeeman to get the
cooperation of the whole COUimtm
ity instead of bearing tile entire
burden himself.
An efficient school always has

proof of this fact. The people
are evidently a reading people,
a people of great neighborliness
and real cuture. The homes are
j pretty, the new ones gifing evi
dence of having been designed Dy,^
, competent architects (which j s j
not always true of farm houses),
and the people dress simply with-,

while the editor of a neighbor
paper aaid recently that farm

he would find men in many town

sats war has aided
cause of abstinence
Washington, Aug.
European war has given impetus
to the movement toward abstin
ence, Secretary Daniels said Wed
nesday night in an address at the
46th annual meeting of the Cath
olic Total Abstinence Society of
America. He expressed hope and
belief that "the day is coming
when total abstinence will prevail
in America."
The most powerful argument
today for accession to the ranks
of total abstinence is war," Mr
Daniels said. "The Russians and
the French have in this war set
an example in total abstinence
that is unparalleled. The exam
ple of crowned heads, great ad
mirals and generals, who because
they feel the necessity of cool
heads and steady nerves, have
joined the rank« of total abstain
ers. gives a mighty impulse to
vour own and all like organiza
tions seeking the only way to the
highest efficiency in peace and in
war."

KEEP UP COMMUNITY PRIDE.
Just as you can destroy his faith '
in himself and so ruin a chilli's
career by continually emphasizing
Ins faults without recogni/nu his
good qualities, so people who
should be leaders often ruin a
community in the same way. The
right way to make a boy do his
best is not to be continually look
ing out fur mistakes and reprov
ing him for them (though this
i must be done in some measure),
I but rather to lie constantly on the
lookout for good traits, mention-,highways
ing and encouraging these. The
I same rule should be adopted in
! dealing with
j «teaiimg with communities, as we
* 110 reminded by the following
sensible counsel which Prof. E. R.
Dy,^ rüVes gives to pastors interested j
j in community betterment: :
"In his attack upon social evils
a,1( ^ ^' s impatience with unwhole-j
some conditions, thepastor of the J
v '" a " e °* country church needs
ever *° ' ,e m0f} t careful that he
does n °t destroy community self
res P ec t. Destructive criticism
maj be both honest and just with
out being wise. Merely to be
risfht is by no means enough.
Nothing requires greater skill
more knowledge of human na
ture, more unselfish thinking than
criticism and denunciation. The, 1
promise of better things is based
upon proper community pride
and the whole matter is mad«
hopeless if the effort for reform
kills the respect of the commun
ity for itself.
"It is especially important to
realize that the first effect of sue
criticism may not disclose its
deeper result. 'It is possible to
stir protests and win approval
and yet poison the sources of ef
fective reconstruction. The safe
method emphasizes what may be
as well as declares what is. In
direct criticism is more profitable
an d lasting even if direct denun
ciation stings more. The com
munity may come to accept the
unhappy picture drawn of it
perhaps based on fact, as-its true
likeness and give up all social
ambition. In the process of
what is often more fault-finding,
the pastor may destroy the basis
of confidence, enthusiasm and
eouraige which he needs for re
construction."—Ex.
