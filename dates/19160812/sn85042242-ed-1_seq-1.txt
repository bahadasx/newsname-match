Through N. D.
ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE
SEE HIM AT BISMARCK
Medora, Roosevelt's Old Home,
Gives Former Justice Noisiest
Reception.
Change of schedule and rain did not
prevent large crowds greeting Charles
Evan (Hughes, Republican candidate
for president, at every stop on his
way across western 'North Dakota yes­
terday in a special train.
The first speech made by the for­
mer justice, after he left Fargo, was
at Bismarck at 8:20 a. m. Reports of
the change of time from noon to early
morning were not received until too
late to give general notification of the
new schedule.
Crowd At Station.
Nevertheless, soon after a long
blast of the whistle of the Hughes
Electric company's power house, an­
nouncing that the special was ap­
proaching, a crowd estimated at 1,000
persons gathered on the station plat1
form.
Arrangements had been made to
have the train met by the !Elks band
and to have large delegations from
surrounding towns present. These
plans were all upset by the change
made necessary because of the stop
at Billings, Mont. Many, however,
who it was impossible to inform, mot­
ored in, and at noon there were mdre
people in town than during session
days.
Besides (Bismarck, stops were made
at Mandan, .Dickinson, Medora and
'Beach, in .North Dakota. Brief talks
were given at all -these places, save
Medora, where, at the old home of
Colonel Roosevelt, Mr/ and Mrs.
'Hughes stepped off the platform and
shook hands with the crowds.
'Here 'agoin^iie -change fn rpfens
made it impossible to 'give the presi­
dential candidate the reception plan­
ned CdWboJrs from the surrounding
ranches'hhd' made* preparations to
give" 1iim, *on horseback, one' of the
old-time salutations that made the
town famous: wheh: the Colonel and

form to greet him.:

"'/Heated With interest.
Referring1 to1 his trip 'through this
state, former Governor Hughes said:
"It was very delightful. was es­
pecially pleased with the deep inter­
est taken in the issues of this cam­
paign.
'lAt every stop there was a very
generous response to the statement
of the issues. It seems to me that
protection, maintenance of our rights
and efficiency and economy in public
administration cannot fail to secure
the support fthe intelligent people
of North Dakota.
At Bismarck 23 Years Ago,
"I first visited' Bismarck 8® years
ago. It is amazing, the tremendous
development that this section of the
country had had since that time.
"I appreciate the reception given to
me at Bismarck keenly. It was fine
that so many people came out so early
in the morning."
Senator Porter J. McCumber, who
accompanied Mr. Hughes on his trip
through the state, was exceedingly
optimistic over the reception that the
justice had had.
'Speeches Strong and Earnest.
"His speeches have been strong,
straightforward and earnest," declar­
ed the senator.. "He was enthusiastic­
ally received at every stop. He makes
friends and supporters of all who list-,
en to his able discussions.
"It was exceedingly unfortunate
that it was necessary to change the
schedule. But we found that Billings
had been inadvertently left out and it
was essential that it should not be.
The stop there could only be made by
leaving Fargo at 1 a. m., instead o!
6:47, as first planned. By making the
change we were compelled to pass
through Valley City and Jamestown
at night."
Committee Goes to Mandan.
W. J. Prater, chairman of the coun­
ty Republican committee, and C. R.
Kositzky, F. S. (Halcott and F. E.
Packard rode In Mr. Hughes special
to Mandan. General T. H, Tharalson
accompanied the train to Medora,
where Senator McCumber and Gunder
Olson, chairman of the state central
committee, left the special, returning
to Fargo on No. 2. Congressman P.
D. Norton rode through to Beach.
Warden Talcott talked with Mr.
Hughes several minutes of the old
college days at Williams. Mr. Talcott
graduated a year before Mr. Hughes.
The Bismarck Speech.
The speech delivered at Bismarck
follows:
Mr. and Mrs. Hughes insisted on
getting down and shaking hands. Rap­
id work gave them both an oppor­
tunity to meet more than 500 of those
present.

President Seriously Considering
Taking Trans-Continental
Campaign Trip,
PLANS DEPEND ON
ACTION OF CONGRESS
Washington, Aug. 11.—President
Wilson is seriously considering a
trans-continental trip. Congressional
callers at the White House today gain­
ed the impression that he virtually
had decided on such a step, but offi­
cials said later that his plans for the
campaign still were uncertain and de­
pended largely on congress.
Invitations to the president to speak
in all parts of the country are being
placed on file in case Mr. Wilson de­
cides to make one or more long cam­
paign trips. Some of his advisors are
strongly urging him to cross the conti­
nent, but others believe he should
spend most of the time during the
campaign at his summer home at
Shadow Lawn, N. 0., receiving dele­
gations, at the same time keeping in
close touch with the government de­
partment in Washington.
Democratic leaders insisted today
that the campaign trip of Chafes E.
Hughes, the Republican, nomiftW
would have .no effect dMthc pE5i^
dent's plans. They said uiat at any
-rate, Mr. Wilson would make no ex­
tended trip from Washington until
after congress adjourns. The date of
adjournment, is epected to be known
in about two weeks.
Camp May Be Shifted to More
Sanitary Situation as
Result.
Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 11— With
over 100 men of the First North Da­
kota infantry in the army hospitals
at Mercedes and Brownsville, Te., suf­
fering from dysentry and from the
change in climate and rations, a move
may be made in the near future to
San Diego, Calif., or some other point,
according to camp rumors. Field offi­
cers refuse to verify them.
Army officers declare this section of
T&cas to be the most unhealthy por­
tion of the lower Rio Grande, while
the Rio Grande river keeps rising at
such a pace that the regiment may
be forced to move on quick notice to
escape flooding. Heavy rains during
the past few wee^s have caused the
river to swell grelatly over its usual
height, until it is within a short dis­
tance of flooding the entire lower val­
ley, In which the North Dakotans are
situated.
The entire regiment was given its
regular weekly inspection this morn­
ing by the various battalion com­
manders. At these inspections, shoes
must be shined, leggins polished,
clothes cleaned, faces shaved, artd
even the dirt floors of the squad tents
must be made to shine.' Heaven help
the enlisted man with a speck of dirt
or a stain on his trousers, or a spear
of grass under his bunk.
The first long marck of the regi­
ment was undertaken yesterday morn­
ing, when the boys hiked" about
seven miles with filled canteens in
less' than three hours. All of the men
were in good condition on the return.
PORTAL DISTRICT HIT
BY HEAVY HAIL STORM
Portal, N. D., Aug. 11.—A severe
rain and hail storm struck this sec­
tion, doing great damage to crops and
buildings. Standing grain was beaten
down and potatoes and other vege­
table crops.were damaged and de­
stroyed. A strong wind drove the
hailstones with tremendous force,
breaking through screens and demol­
ishing all windows facing the storm.
The storm moved through a compara­
tively narrow section but twisted and
turned in every direction, reaching
farms on the Canadian side.

London, 'Aug. 11.—Russian, Italian
and French armies continue success­
fully their respective offensives and
according to the latest official com­
munications have taken more terri­
tory from the forces of the Central
powers in France, Galicia and Aus­
tria.
Stanislau, 87 miles southeast of
Lemberg, the capital of Galicia, and
an Important railway taction, has
been occupied by Russian troops un­
der General -Letchitzky. addition,
the Russians have programed on the
line of the Stereh river^ as wel as
along the Zlota Lipa, taking import­
ant positions south of Brady and cap­
turing the railway town of Monaster
zyska and several,villages.
The taking of Stanislau, which Vien­
na says was evacuated without fight­
ing, opens another gateway Jjh^Qugh
which the Russians may advance to­
ward Lemberg. Already, (Petrograd
says, the Austro-Germans are being
pursued toward Halich, a railway
junction north of Stanislau and on the
Dniester river. Petrograd reports the
capture of 5,000 more Austro-Ger­
mans.
Italians Still Advancing.
The Italian army, under the Duke of
Aosto, which took Gorizia, is losing

STUIP FM HUGHES
New York, Aug. 11.—Theodore

can campaign, it was announced here
tonight by William R. Willcox, nation­
al chairman, who visited the former
president at Oyster Bay today.
THE SECOND
CROP OE ALFALFA
The second crop of alfalfa is being
cut and it is a good crop. The first
crop was good too. The alfalfa has
thrived under the weather conditions
that have bred rust for the grain
crops. Some are leaving the second
crop for seed. The possibility in seed
production from Grimm alfalfa is well
demonstrated on the Lakota Demon­
stration farm. The net returns per
acre after allowing for cost of pro­
duction which includes labor, machin­
ery cost, interest on investment, etc.,
was |90,64. Results like these can
not be epected every year. Grimm al­
falfa is proving to be one of the great­
est crops in North Dakota farming
and it is one of the most dependable.
It brings inmoney in two ways, the
hay and seed. In wet summers the
hay crops are the big features and
in the dry season, seed is produced
the most abundantly. Whether the
year be wet or dry, the alfalfa gives
returns and the most valuable return
is the seed which is produced best in
a dry year. It is rather an unusual
thing to have a crop make the most
profit in a dry year.

Motto Used 'by Democrats
'in 1912.
"PITILES8 PUBLICITY" IS
BY-WORD ACCEPTED
"If I Am Chosen, I Will Have
Things Done Right," Says

Nominee.
Billings,
Mont.,
Aug. •jt^-Charles
E. Hughes, addressing an' faience in
a big tent
on
the ^illage ^)ffire here
tonight, prefaced his ady
protective tariff with the
that if he should bq elected
nothing would be "pulled
vate benefit at the public'•«
icy of a
slaration
resident
for pri
jpense if
he could prevent it,, Mr. Hughes also
adopted the Democratic slogan of the
1912 campaign, "Pitiless Publicity."
"l desire in all that we do in this
campaign," Mr. Hughes said, "to have
what was called a little while ago,
four years ago, 'pitiless publicity.' I
want pitiless publicity with respect to
the pork barrel.
"I want pitiless publicity with re­
spect to the sectionalism of this ad­
ministration. I want pitiless public­
ity with respect to the extravagance
and wastefulness of this administra­
tion.
"I want pitiless publicity with re­
spect to the incompetency of ap­
pointees of this administration. Let
us see that
We
have America first in
the hearts of every American, of
whatever race or creed, and also Am­
erica equal to her tasks—America ef­
ficient."
Again Speaks on Tariff.
Mr. Hughes also assailed the ad­
ministration for hailing changed its
tariff views 8in#*T$L2 and repeated
his declaration ,4n. favor of a protect­
ive tariff, whq&e enactment and en­
forcement shpuld left to the iRe
publican pwy.,- -}A
"t propfei.* ai$Itud£'
for business in this country," he con­
tinued. "I have done my share in
attempting to correct abuses and
what I have just said must be supple­
mented by the remark that if I am
elected, in connection with tariff leg­
islation, there will be nothing pulled
off for private benefit at the public
expense if I know it ^nd can prevent
it.
"I am not in this campaign and I
have not left the career of my choice
to play politics for anybody. I am
here pimply because I believe 1 have
been summoned to serve the Ameri­
can people—at least to give them a
chance to choose for me such service
as they desire.
Will Have Things 'Done Right.
"If I am chosen I propose to devote
whatever ability I possess to having
things done right in this country for
the interests of the people, believing
that my party will attain honor and
win the success it deserves and the
only success it deserves is as a party
of service and I shall not prostitute
the offices of the United States for
partisan rewards of incompetent per
sons."
The nominee repeated previous at­
tacks on the course of the administra­
tion toward exico, also his declaration
that the administration had brought
this country into serious differences
with Mexico.
Mr. Hughes called attention to the
fact that Montana is the first north­
western state to be visited on this
trip where women have the vote, and
reiterated the declaration that he
wanted the iissue speedily settled by
amendment, granting women suffrage
to the federal constitution.

Mr. Hughes was about to get on,
but he saw the boy dashing up, let
go of the rod and started towards the
rider.
The wheels of the train began to re­
volve and his private car started the
other way.
The people on the rear platform

MDEH fl IN SlilEl!
Omaha, Aug. 11.—A church, with a
roof garden, including flowera, com­
fortable chairs, lights, and .only, the
sky overhead is the dream Rev- Harry
V. Foster of Dundee Presbyterian
church, Omaha, cherishes as the ideal
church of the future.
"If churches would biuld roof gar­
dens for use on summer evenings,
ministers would not be preacjhing to
empty pews and moving picture hous­
es would not be doing so thriving a
business," he says.
Rev. Foster favors biulding roof
igardenB over the Sunday school and
study rooms rather than over the
main auditorium. When the project
of a new proposed $80,000 church
comes up among his parishioi.ers, he
says he stands pat for a roof garden.
"Hotels and apartment houses are
looking after the comfort of their pat­
rons with roof gardens. Why not
churches?" he asks.
Rev. Foster is a lover of baseball,
golf and tennUj^'a horticulturist and
gardener ,of BOitie note, and on expert

unalterably opposed to arbitration and

High Cost of Breadstuffs Will Be
Looked Into by Com
missioner.
Washington, Aug. 11.—Whether
there shall be a federal investigation
of the high cost of flour and pros­
pective increases in bread prices de­
pends largely on the report of Com­
missioner Hurley, now in Chicago,
making informal inquiries for the fed­
eral trade commission.
Mr. Hurley went to Chicago partic­
ularly to seek definite information at
the headquarters of the National Bak
eers' association concerning state­
ments made during the association's
convention at Lafte City today, that
the price of bread soon would be in­
creased. Officials of the commission
said today, however, that they would
look into the general question of flour
and bread prices.
The departments of agriculture and
justice also are giving attention to
the subject, although there has been
no formal action.
Copies of a resolution passed by the
bakers at Salt Lake City, calling on
congress to place an embargo on flour
exports, were received today by Vice
President Marshall and Speaker
