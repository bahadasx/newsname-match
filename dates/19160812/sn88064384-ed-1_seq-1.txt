A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
We are anxious to see that all lines owned by
other parties and connected with us are kept in such
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are responsible for their upkeep,
we want to co-operate with them.
All lines require a thorough overeauling occa
sionally if the best service is to be obtained. We
recommend that every line connected with us be
overhauled at least once a year, and that at least one
experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
cost of this work when divided among all the patrons
of the line, makes the amount paid by each man
small, and this cost will be more than offset by the
improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in this sec
tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We will gladly do
what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your lice.

P. A. puts new joy
into the sport of
smoking !
Y OU may live to
be 110 and never
feel old enough to
vote, but it's cer
tain-sure you'll not
know the joy and
contentment of a
friendly old jimmy
pipe or a hand rolled
cigarette unless you get on talking-terms
with Prince Albert tobacco!
P. A. comes to you with a real reason for all the
goodness and satisfaction it offers. It is made by
a patented process that removes bite and parch!
You can smoke it long and hard without a come
back! Prince Albert has always been sold without
coupons or premiums. We prefer to give quality!
Prince Albert affords the keenest pipe and cigarette
enjoyment! And that flavor and fragrance and
coolhess is as good as that sounds. P. A. just
answers the universal demand for tobacco
without bite, parch or kick-back!
Introduction to Prince Albert isn't any harder
than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A." You pay
out a little change, to be sure, but it's the cheer
fullest investment ycu ever made!
