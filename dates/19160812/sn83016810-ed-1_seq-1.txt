BALK AT MARRIAGE
English Nobility Reluctant to Talk
Matrimony With Servian Prince
WARMLY GREETED ON VISIT.
Alexander Makes Great Impression For
Himself and His People, but Rumor
of a Wife Hunt Causes Many to
Place Themselves on Guard Against
Any Matrimonial Talk.
London. .Alexander, crown prince
and regent of Servia, has been in
England hunting a wife, it is rumored,
as well as seeking political and finan
cial assistance in recovering his coun
try. He made a great Impression and
created a warm sentimeent for him
self and his people. But fathers with
marriageable daughters, from King
George downward, did not appear anx
ious to meet any matrimonial advances
from the prince. He went to Bucking
ham palace and was entertained by
the king and queen. Prince Albert was
delegated to meet him at the station
and to see him off when he departed.
But Princess Mary did not come in
contact with him.
The hesitation manifested by English
fathers and mothers of high degree to
an alliance with Prince Alexander is
largely caused by the uncertainty of
his ever sitting upon the throne of his
father and the certainty of his living
in constant danger of his life if he ever
is able to return to Belgrade. It has
taken some time for England to over-

CROWN PRINCE ALEXANDER.
come its feeling of repugnance to the
prince and his father, King Peter hav
ing always been held responsible for
the murder of King Alexander and
Queen Draga, whose deaths removed
the obstacles in the way of his own ac
cession, while Prince Alexander was
blamed primarily for the assassination
of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand
and the Duchess of Hohenberg. The
prince's gallant conduct in the war and
the general feeling in England that the
British government was responsible for
unwisely advising the Servian army to
resist the invaders and hold out until
the allies sent re-enforcements have
created a reversion of feeling in his
favor.
The government took paini not to
Involve England in any way with the
affairs of Servia except as relating to
this war. The prince was the guest
of Lord Kitchener, and at York House
Prince Alexander met Sir Edward
Grey, the secretary of foreign affairs,
in a party which included the Earl of
Derby and Walter Long, both mem
bers of the government. Sir Edward
Grey was likewise present at the din
ner given in honor of the prince by
Lewis Harcourt on behalf of the gov
ernment. The Marquis of Crewe, lead
er of the government in the house of
lords, presided at this dinner. The
Eussian ambassador, the Japanese am
bassador, the Belgian minister, the
Portuguese minister, the Marquis of
Lansdowne, Lord- Kitchener, Arthur
Balfour, Walter Runciman, Lord Rob
ert Cecil, General Sir William Robert
son and the lord chancellor were pres
ent.
Sir Edward Grey was also upon the
platform at Victoria station when
Prince Alexander, accompanied by
Prince Albert and Lord Kitchener, ar
rived to take the train for the coast
and embark for the continent. The
foreign secretary of the British gov
ernment did not entertain the prince
regent of Servia at any official hos
pitality. And, although the prince re
gent was accompanied by his prima
minister, M. Pashitch, they were not
received or entertained by the British
prime minister-, Mr. Asquith.
Seldom has any visiting royalty evei
received in England such a deputation
of distinguished men In different walks
of life as waited upon Prince Alex
ander at his hotel.

CHICKENS KNEW HER.
And Kansas Woman Had No Treufale
I Getting Them Back.
Wichita, Kan.Mrs. John Matthews,
residing on Kelly street, stopped abrupt
I ly in front of 312 West Third street
one morning lately. Inside a chicken
fence were many chickens. Among
them were four large White Orping
tons. She observed them keenly.
"Those are mine," she said, satisfied,
and then she sought out her husband.
Together they went to city court and
got out a search and seizure warrant.
Then, in company with William Bal
lard, deputy marshal, they went back
again to 312 West Third street, opened
the chicken yard gate and walked into
the pen.
A woman ran out on the back porch
and demanded to know what business
the party had in her chicken yard.
"Just came after my chickens," re
torted Mrs. Matthews as she called to
her "pets." The four big chickens ran
up to her, and she picked them up.
"I had 'em marked with blue rib-
bons," she told the marshal as she
lifted the feathers on the legs. Sure
enough there were the ribbons!
"Yours!" said the deputy marshal.
"But the Judge will have to act before
you can have them."
THEIR "AT HOME" IN JAIL
Bride and Bridegroom Accused of Not
Telling Truth About Ages.
Hart, Mich.Albert White a-wooing
wentwent all the way from Colfax
township, Oceana county, to Battle
Creek. Now he's back and with him the
bride he won, but they spent their "at
home" period in the Oceana county jail.
Their offense against the peace and
dignity of the state, as formally al
leged, was that they didn't tell the
truth about their ages when they got
their license to wed.
The banana peel in the path of love
was an angry mother. Albert slipped
up and dragged down his bride when
Mrs. Mary Decker, who objected to
Mamie getting married, heard that the
girl swore she was eighteen when she
was seventeen, as her mother reckons
it. White, who gave his age as twenty,
is said to be nineteen.
The families lived on adjoining
farms in Colfax. Decker and his fam
ily moved to Battle Creek last August.
17 SENIORS UNKISSED.
Class President Says They Are Crosses
Between Heroes and Darned Fools.
Muskogee, Okla.Of the thirty-five
boy members of the senior class of
Central high school in this city seven
teen admit they have never kissed or
been kissed.
Thomas Leech, president of the
class, Is not one of them. "As presi
dent of the class," he said, "I consider
that the unkissed reflect great glory
upon the seniors and upon Central
high. As a man, speaking unofficially,
I say I think they are darned fools or
perhaps martyrs. That is what a mar
tyr is anyhowa cross between a hero
and a darned fool."
The girl members of the class are.
to put it mildly, astonished at the reve
lation. One of them declared that she
was "for starting a campaign for the
benefit of the seventeen," and that, if
necessary, she was perfectly willing
to undertake the whole task by her
self. MUST RUN TO AVOID KILLING.
Court Rules It's Murder to Stand When
Life Is Threatened.
Trenton, N. J.In an opinion filed
here recently by Chief Justice Gum
mere sustaining a conviction of mur
der in the second degree the supreme
court says:
"A person upon whom an assault is
made so violent in its character as to
endanger his life or threatens him with
serious bodily harm is not justified or
excusable in standing his ground and
killing his assailant if he can avoid the
impending danger by retreating."
The case was that of Nunzio di Maria
of Harrison, who was sentenced to
I from twenty to thirty years In prison
for shooting Frank Barber.
The charge of the trial court to the
jury regarding the law of self defense
was the only ground for .reversal of the
conviction. The instruction objected to
was that the defendant had a right to
save his own life.

Savannah, Ga"Twenty-four feet of
men." That is what members of Bat
tery A, Chatham artillery, call the four
McDonald brothersBill, Bob, Alex
and Bernard. They are known also as
"The Giant Quartet," "The Big
Macks" and the "Fighting Four." But
their father, Bernard L. McDonald of
the city health department, towers
over them all he's six feet two.
Bill Is the youngest and shortest, be
tng scant six feet. Bob, next, Is the
tallest, exceeding BUI In height by an
inch and a half. Alex, the eldest, and
Bernard' ate just an inch shorter than
Bob.
The four are a quartet in the musical
sense also, each being possessed of a
pleasing voice. Alex has been "end

HIS FAMILY'S FACES
He Is 1 o'clock, His Wife Is 2, and
Children Go According to Age.
St. Joseph, Mo.The flight of the
hours are marked on the dial of C. W.
Humbert's watch by the faces of his
ten children and by his own face and
the face of his wife. Tiny photo
graphs are set in the dial In place of
the Roman numerals. Every time Mr.
Humberdwho is a grading contractor
herelooks at the time he sees his
whole family.
He Is 1 o'clock and his wife is 2. The
children are arranged in the order of
their birth, beginlng at 3 o'clock with
Carl, who is thirty-four, and continu
ing through Calvin, Albert, Bertha,
Glen, George, Eva, OH0bjest*v Vernon
and little 12 o'clock Edith, wlipis
three and the youngest of the family.
The watch was made especially for
Mr. Humberd a few years ago and
he is so used to it that he can tell the
exact time at a glance. He arises at
Albert o'clock in the morning, has
luncheon at half-past Edith and, is
usually home by Bertha.
If he refers to the watch a score of
times throughout the day he is remind
ed each time of his loved ones and
there is little chance that he will ever
forget his family in the rush of busi
ness. The idea of putting the family
in the watch occurred to him as a sen
timental novelty, unlike anything he
had ever heard of. His work as a
grading contractor carries him out of
town frequently, but he reports he is
not so lonely as he used to be, since he
feels that he can take a glimpse at his
youngsters any time he cares to with
out attracting outside attention.
RETURNS AFTER THIRTY YEARS
Sailor Had Been In Almost Every Port,

DRAINED ALL THE LAND.
Water Over Low Tract Disappeared
When Ditch Is Dug.
Rockport, Mo.The outlet ditch that
drains Lake Nishnabotna at Langdon
is the talk of the whole Missouri bot
tom. The effects have been almost mi
raculous.
It seems that when the ditch drained
the NIshna, water standing all over
the bottom, whether It had a connec
tion with the ditch or not, disappeared,
often in the night, leaving the ground
fit for cultivation within a few days.
The Nishnabotna river has been
Btanding full of water for about a year,
and as the water level was almost as
high as the great body of surrounding
land, the water soaked through and
saturated it all.

POPS BENEDICT XV.
to the Catholic church on the part of
influential members of the Italian
cabinet, combined withvtbe fear of
German submarines, has brought to
the pope the privilege of flying his own
flag once more in Italian waters. The
steamer has been bought by the Vati
can to convey ofl&cials of the Catholic
church whom the pope desires to send
abroad as his representatives. The
first voyage will be to South America,
to convey the new papal nuncio, Mgr.
Bassallo di Torregrossa, to Buenos
Aires.
The steamer, to be known as the
Nuncius, is painted with broad white
and yellow stripes easily distinguished
by submarines. Its safety is guaran
teed, it is understood, by one of those
secret agreements with Germany of
which the papacy has been accused at
various times by the quadruple entente.
There would appear, however, to be no
necessity for such a guarantee after
the German government had been in
formed that such a vessel was on the
high seas. Nothing would be gained
by its destruction through a subma
rine. On the other hand, to grant it
safety, even without this being request
ed by the papacy, would warm the
hearts of Emperor William's Catholic
subjects and stimulate their loyalty to
him.
Prince von Buelow, a diplomatic en
voy at the Vatican in his younger
years, long before he was German am
bassador at Rome, has always been
friendly to the papal government It is
reported in London and has been for
eight or nine months that Buelow be
lieves in the restoration of temporal
power to the pope as the best method
of punishing Italy for participating in
the war against her former allies of
the triple alliance. While making ex
tended visits to Switzerland Buelow
has had frequent consultations with
Catholic cardinals and other dignita
ries of the church.
The pope's refusal to align himself
on the side of the quadruple entente
and especially to make public any pro
test against the invasion of Catholic
Belgium by the Germans is declared in
England to be due to a promise made
by the sovereigns of the central em
pires that his temporal authority is to
be restored after the war. The plan is,
according to these reports, to make the
pope the political as well as the spirit
ual sovereign in Palestine. A small
state would be established, including
Jerusalem and the other holy places as
well as the seaport of Jaffa. The terri
tory is believed to be enormously rich
in natural resources and to be able to
support a cardinal viceroy/who would
rule there in the name of the pope.
The British government a few months
after the beginning of the war made
the extraordinary move of sending a
minister to the Vatican, Sir Henry
Howard,who had had along diplomatic
experience. This was a recognition of
the pope's status as a sovereign, which
Britain, along with all other non-Cath
olic governments, withdrew from the
pope in 1870. Russia at the same time
reopened her legation at the Vatican,
where there had been no envoy for
some time on account of the refusal of
Russia to grant Catholics the protec
tion which the papacy demanded.
France has had no representative at
the Vatican for some time, and neutral
Catholic countries like Spain had also
broken off diplomatic relations with the
pope before the war,.,_,,
SENTRY A CANDIDATE

Arizona Man Make? Forty Miles to
Find ReliefReported
"Missing."
Douglas, Ariz.Adam Dockery, a
private in Company B, Arizona militia,
recently reported as missing, returned
to camp after walking nearly forty
miles while on outpost duty.
The private, a recent recruit, it was
said at militia headquarters, was placed
on guard at the international line, with
instructions to walk to the east until
he met the sentry he was to relieve.
Dockery missed the sentry. He kept
walking until finally he met a patrol
on guard, twenty miles east of the
camp.
"Dockery certainly obeyed Instruc
tions," an officer remarked, "but it is
a good thing he met that patrol, or he
probably would have walked to El
Paso." HOUSE CARRIED THIRTY
MILES BY TORNADO
Heavy Construction Literally Torn
to ShredsParts Distributed
Over Three Indiana Counties.
Brownstone, Ind.Bits of books and
pieces of boards have been picked up
in Jackson and Scott counties which
were identified as parts belonging to the
house of Mrs. Elizabeth Wilcox, a wid
ow living near Campbellsburg, Wash
ington county, which was destroyed by
a tornado and scattered along In the
path of the storm for a distance of
about thirty miles.
The house, a two story eight room
building, stoutly constructed and in
good shape, was literally torn to shreds
in a few seconds. A barn across the
road from the house was demolished,
and of the corn crib, made of large
round logs, no trace has been found.
A large rug was taken off the floor of
the house and carried about five miles.
A heavy iron range was found about a
quarter of a mile from the house, and
an iron kettle weighing about seventy
five pounds was found a mile away
from the place the next day.
Mrs. Wilcox felt a slight Jar of the
house Just before going to bed on a cot
near a large stone fireplace. Parts of
the fireplace fell on her and pinioned
her to the floor. The house was splin
tered and carried away by the storm.
The tornado had dipped and struck a
knoll just across the road from the
house and scraped the sod off a space
about twenty-five feet square.
Alex Brown, who lives near, stepped
out early in the morning and found his
front porch gone. Looking over toward
Mrs. Wilcox's place, he noticed the
rums and hurried over. He found Mrs.
Wilcox conscious and soon removed
the stones that held her down. A doc
tor was called, and it was found that
one arm was broken, her chest crushed
in and bruises and scratches covered
her body.
Three five-dollar gold pieces were
carried away. One of them was found
later about half a mile from the house.
Rabbits and fox squirrels were slaugh
tered by the storm when it struck the
woods east of the place. Of the 150
chickens on the place not more than
twenty-five could be found, and several
of them were stripped of their feathers
by the storm. A black oak tree about
three feet in diameter was found near
the house, and no one seems to know
where it came from, as there are no
black oaks in the woods near by. An
apple orchard was blown about a quar
ter of a mile from the place, and there
was not a fence or post left standing
on the place.

Pasadena, CalAn angler who is

documentary evidence of the follow

While fishing in Deep creek recently
he spotted a twelve inch trout and tried
for an hour to land it Following it
from rock to rock, spashing through
the water in pursuit as it played its
game Of hide and seek, the weary fish
erman finally closed in on the fish un
der a ledge which overlooked the water.
As he peeped over the edge to land
his game the trout leaped to his face
and fastened itself in his jaw. It held
on until two companions came to the
rescue, beating off the assailant with
the butt ends of casting rods.
The cafe proprietor's face became
swollen to twice its normal size. He
and his companions are warm In their
praise of the efficiency of whisky as

declare that a bottle which they had
handy saved the unfortunate angler's

YOUTHFUL SNAKE HUNTERS.
Boys Handle Dangerous Reptiles Like
Professional Charmers.
Galena, Kan.Two small boys, Wil
lie and Robert Shorl, the elder of
whom is about fourteen, have produc
ed a new sensation in the vicinity of
their home at Five Mile, where they
have a cage full of writhing snakes of
many varieties. They play with these
reptiles without the least sign of fear,
going through with all the stunts of
professional snake charmers.
The collection consists of black
snakes, blue racers, chicken snakes
and three ugly looking Hattlers. On
Saturdays they usually go to Snake
branch and hunt for more reptiles.
However, these new reptiles are not
placed with their "pets," but kept in a
separate cage, and are usually shipped
to owners of small shows and muse
ums, from whom they get from $3 to
$5 for each reptile.
Neither of the boys has ever been
bitten. The older boy gave a lecture
on snakes before the pupils of the
Shoal Creek school. He surprised
teacher and pupils alike by his classi
fication of reptiles, giving their Latin
names and discussing the harmless or
dangerous varieties, taking each from
a box as he explained their varied hab

BIG LOSS BY DEPREDATIONS.
Northern Border of Country Attacked

Guatemala City.The people of the
republic of Guatemala, Mexico's neigh
bor to the south, are about as nearly
out of patience with the Carranza gov
ernment as are those of the United
States. The depredations along the
northern border of this country, which
began as soon as Carranza found him
self accepted by the American govern
ment as a real ruler, have continued at
intervals ever since,
x. The damage suffered by the citizens
living on the frontier has not been so
great as that inflicted on Americans
along the Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico border, because the dividing
line is much shorter and the country
is less thickly settled.
The tactics against Americans, how
ever, seem to be the same as those em
ployed in the norththe quick raid
upon some Isolated and unprotected
hamlet, the shooting of a few inoffen
sive and unarmed people, the looting
and the hurried get away.
Although the Carranza government
has steadily disclaimed all responsibil
ity for these incursions and has placed
the responsibility upon the omnipres
ent bandits, enough evidence has been
collected by government agents to
show that many of the attacks were
participated in by men known to be
Carranza partisans maintaining a loose
sort of military, organization.

the department of Peten, the object of
the maurauders is to steal the labori
ously obtained and valuable stores of
chicle from which chewing gum is
made and for which the forests of
Peten are famous.
The chicle finds a ready market
among dealers near by and is shipped
out of the country as a Mexican prod
uct, usually to the United States.
A trip through the interior of the
country is sufficient to convince the
traveler that the republic was never in

cans, most of whom are known to be
hi Carranza's pay. These gentlemen
have been promptly deported.
United States silver dollars in the
district between Guatemala City and
Puerto Barrios, the Atlantic port, are
much more in evidence than they are
along Broadway. No one seems to be
able to explain the influx of coins, but
they are welcomed, and the tattered
money of the republic Is a bad second
in popularity.
Only second in Importance to the
business boom among all classes is the

Bread forms the most Important part
of the people's food, and bread has
been steadily rising in price on account
of the control of the grist mills by a
few large syndicates. President Estra
da Cabrera called a halt on this by na
tionalizing all the water powers of the
country, setting up mills and leasing
them under suitable regulations.
These mills cut the price of bread,
and the syndicate, unable to compete
with them by using steam power, found
their grip on the pantry of the repub
lic broken.
