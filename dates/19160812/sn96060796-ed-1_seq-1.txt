cent were paid during the quart
er, totaling $437,500. This is
shown in the quarterly report cf

The cantaloupe crop of the
Mesa growers this year proved
a paying proposition for those
engaged in the industry. Prom
a total of 800 acres 382 cars of
melons were sent out from Mesa,
and the prices received were in
all cases satisfactory, ranging
from $1 for flats to $4.50 for
standard.
Harold-Bell Wright, the well
known novelist, has returned to
his retreat at Oracle, the Tucson
summer colony, in the Catalina
mountains, north of that city.
He goes for the purpose of es
tablishing in a camp near his
own, an old friend, Dr. Williams,
of Pittsburg, Pa., who is accom
panied by his family.
Denying his motion for a re
hearing, the supreme court of
Arizona has set September 15 as
the date for the execution of
Robert Dayton Talley, the Gila
county murderer, who was con
victed five years ago of the mur
der of a man in Miami. Talley

Locey, who expects to start
work very soon on a group of
mines near Prescott, is an avia
tion expert and proposes to use
a Curtis biplane on his journeys
between the city and the mining
camp. The machine already has
been ordered from St. Louis. It
is of large carrying capacity,
that it may be loaded at need
with camp supplies Journal

Charging the University of
Arizona and the board of regents
of that institution with careless
ness and negligence, Joseph L.
Cloud, father of Leo. Cloud,
who was electrocuted at the un
iversity in March, 1915, is suing
the institution for $50,000 dam
ages. Young Cloud met his
death by coming in contact with
a live wire while painting a tank
at the university.
Walter Mclntyre left Wednes
day for Phoenix, where he will
have his right eye removed. Sev
eral week ago, Mr. Mclntyre,
while working in the field thresh
ing barley, a barley beard flew
into his right eye. For a time it
was thought the eye could be
saved, but the pupil had been
pierced and sight destroyed, and
to save the sight in the left eye,
the right eye must be removed.
Permission to build a reservoir,
conduit and power house in Sa
bino canyon in the Cgtalinc
mountains has been granted to
John W. Daily of Tucson by the
secretary of agriculture. The
proposed dam and power plant,
when completed, will be one of
the largest power projects in
Arizona, and is expected to sup
ply power to the city of Tucson,
and to mining camps in the sur
rounding district.
Burros would appear to be
open for appropriation in any
number on the San Pedro river,
where the cattlemen will enter
upon a campaign of extermina
tion, if nothing else can be done,
for the wild donkeys, said to
number more than 1,000, are eat
ing out the range in some local
ities. Most of them are descen
dants of burros turned out by
Mexicans after service as ore
carrieis in the mining districts.
Congress Junction is decided
ly on the map these days, and is
daily becoming more and more
important as a business point
for mining men. There is every
indication that the coming fall
and winter will be one of the
busiest this district has ever ex
perienced. Increased business,
due to the resumption of opera
tions at the various mines, is
already being noticed, with every
prospect that the activities now
under way will be greatly in
creased in the coming months.
Announcement that the United
States Bureau of Mines had au
thorized a U. S. mining experi
ment station to be located at the
University of Arizona is an im
portant step forward in the pro
gress of Arizona as a mining
state, -and a more important step
in the advancement of the min
ing working at the University of
Arizona. The permanent pro
gress ot the state rests upon the
mines. They encourage and
support the other industries and
cut the trails of civilization and
advancement.
Declaring that patent to min
eral lands has been issued to the
Santa Pe railroad by fraud, mem
bers of the Chloride Mining
Bureau are urging Arizona's re
presentatives in congress to in
vestigate the means by which
patents were secured to some
sections of the old land grant,
made to the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad company in 1866. At
that time congress granted every
other section for twenty miles
on each side of the right of-way
to the railroad company, but ex
cepted from the grant known
mineral lands.
That Prescott has been slum
bering for years on a floor of
gold is indicated by pannings
made from excavations of the
new Yavapai county court house.
Assays of the ore taken from
the trenches for the courthouse
foundation give returns of from
85 cents to $1.15 a cubic yard.
The value of the gold deposits
in the ground on which the
courthouse is to stand, to a
depth of only twelve feet is es
timated at close to $30,000, while
it is conceded that the value of
the gold deposits under the new
courthouse will increase with
depth.
Two impressionistic sketches
in oil showing soldier life at
Nogales, done by Miss Kathe
rine J. Huntley of Redlands,
Cal., are on exhibition in a Con
gress street place of business,
and are attracting much atten
tion. One of the studies is en
titled "G Street" and shows a
tented avenue with a cook tent
in the foreground. The other is
a study of the Second California
encampment and shows the
mountains in the distance. The
coloring is very pleasing and
truthful. Miss Huntley is stay
ing in Tucson at present and is
doing a number of desert paint
ings. Star.
Frank Murphy, formerly pre
sident of the ill-fated Develop
ment Company of America, is
said to have made plans for a
corporation to take over the
Sasco smelter on expiration of
the two years' lease now held by
the American Smelting & Refin
ing company. The latter has
expended about $85,000 on im
provements since taking over
the old plant with such results
that the two furnaces have been
driven to a consumption of 900
tons of copper ore a day, 50 per
cent above their rated capacity.
Ttr's has been made possible
largely through the use of cus
tom fluxing ores.
The board of supervisor will
take advantage of the presence
in Cochise county of the enlisted
men from New Jersey and Mon
tana and will place at their dis
posal in Douglas a couple of
thousand pamphlets that have
been issued showing the re
sources of the county. They
will be placed in several places
in Douglas so that the soldiers
can procure them should they
so desire and they can then send
them to their respective homes.
The board will also furnish en
velopes and all the soldier will
have to do is to pay the postage
and place the address on the
same. Tombstone Prospector.
Active development on the
Black Diamond group of gold
mines, recently purchased by J.
Irwin of San Diego, is now un
der way. The Black Diamond,
which was one of the first mines
located in Yavapai county, was
worked in the early sixties by
means of an arastra. Irwin
bought the mine recently from
W. L. Comer, D. H. Booker and
Mrs. J. B. Hooper. He will con
tinue the old shaft from 85 to
200 feet in depth.
The Ray and Gila Valley rail
road is a first common carrier of
the state to comply with the
order of the corporation commis
sion reducing the passenger
rates of the state railroads to
three cents per mile. In a tariff
filed with the commission, the
company announces that they
have cut the rate between Ray
Junction and Ray, from fifty
cents to thirty-five. Between
Ray and Kelvin, a similar cut
has been made. Tempe News.
Five thousand bales of long
staple Egyptian cotton will be
produced in the Salt River valley
this season, and will net grow
ers thirty cents a pounds, ac
cording to estimates of the Unit
ed States Department of Agri
culture. The entire available
production of Alexandria and
Egyptian cotton this season in
the United States will be less
than . 28,000 bales, it is stated,
while the demand in England is
greater than ever before. Plans
are under way for the produc
tion of 25,000 bales of long
staple cotton in the Salt River
valley next year.
Richard Farrell for the Senate
In the political announcement
column of this week's Patagonian
will be found the announcement
of Hon. Richard Farrell of Har
shaw, who seeks the Democratic
nomination for the office of State
Senator from this county. Mr.
Farrell represented Santa Cruz
county in the lower house of the
last Legislature, and feels that
he should be promoted a peg to
the Senate. He is an oldtimer
in this county and needs no in
troduction to any of the readers
of this paper, except to the new
comers. His record in the legis
lature last term and throughout
the special session was particul
arly good. He was one of the
members who stood out with
Governor Hunt to the last ditch
against, and finally prevented
the passage of the infamous
"mine tax" measure which the
big copper interests tried to foist
upon the people, and thereby
saved the stockmen and farmers
of the State of Arizona many
millions of dollars in taxes. His
record on other important issues
is equally good; the votes he cast
and the stands he took in the
Legislature were for the besfc
interests of the people as a
whole, as against any small
clique who sought to usurp the
law-making privileges for the
purpose of "putting over" meas
ures for their own special benefit.
The experience and good hard
sense of Richard Farrell well en
title him to the Democratic no
mination for State Senator from
this county. Santa Cruz Pata
gonian. Good Roads for Arizona.
Congress has passed a Good
Roads bill which will be of great
benefit to Arizona. The meas
ure appropriates for the whole
country $5,000,000 for the year,
beginning July 1, 1916, and $10,
000,000 for the following year,
adding $5,000,000 each year for
five years in all. Of this sum
Arizona receives for the first
year about $71,000, second year
$143,000, and increasing at the
rate of $71,000 a year so that in
1920 the State will recive $358,
000 or over $1,000,000 during the
next five years.
A further clause of the bill
provides for spending a large
amount in forest areas. Of this
sum about $100,000 a year will,
it is expected, be available for
roads in Arizona. This fund
for roads through and adjacent
to forest reserves is in addition
to the present 25 per cent fund
for road and school purposes.
