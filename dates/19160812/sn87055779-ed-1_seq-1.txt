bandits, in organized groups, who

International Nevrs Service:
WASHINGTON. Aug. 12. A
spirited tight against the ratification
of the Danish West Indies to the
United States developed in the senate
today. "Economy" democrats plan

adding further expenditures to the
growing tax burden.

PETT.OGRAD, Aug. 12. Dis
patches from the Galician front to

the defeat of the Austrians in the
Stanislan region as a rout. They
state that the entire rUht wing of
the enemy was thrown into eon

Russians and that great numbers
surrendered.
A thrilling race is now in pogress

driving at every weak spot that can
be found in the enemy's lines.
The Austro-German forces are
striving to save Halicic, but the Rus

BATTLE CENTERS
T TOLMIN
Capture of Strongly Fortified
City by Italians Would
Shatter Line.
International News Service:
HOME. Aug. 12. A great battle
has developed around Tolmino (Tol
niein) and the capture of the city
by the Italians i$ believed to be im
minent. (Tolmino was one of the chief po
sitions of the Austro-Hungarians on
the Isonzo front. The city, which
was strongly fortified by the Teutons,
lies nearly 20 miles north of Go
rizia, on the Isonzo river. It is on a
railroad and important highways
converge there. Ranges of hills to
the south of the city dominating the
river, gave the Austro-Hungrians
natural defensive works.)
While the right wing of the Italian
armies operating on the Isonzo front
has been occupying the Iolrrdo
plateau and driving the Austro-Hungarians
from their positions on that
high ground, the left wing has ad
vanced victoriously against formid
able positions between Caporett and
Selo. which lie north and south of
Tolmino respectively.
While the third Italian army under
the Duke of Aosta is pushing on east
of Clorizia. the Austro-Hungarians
are trying to reform their ranks. The
rear guard actions that have been
precipitated by the Teutons, have
all resulted in favor of the vic
torious Italians. The Austrians are
preparing to evacuate Trieste.
