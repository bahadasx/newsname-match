Trustee Ask For Bids on New Ma-! Court Order Designating Local At
chlnery That Will Put Municipal torney is Filed in O dice of Clerk
Plant to Front; Well Con
tractor on Ground
At the meeting of the Trustees 'of
the village last Tuesday night En
gineer Dueer of Penver, submitted his
estimates for the new machinery
needed at the municipal electric light
plant and was instructed to call for
bids on his specifications.
Mr. Duerr has gone into the matter
minutely and is prepared to give
Clayton a light plant that will be
without rival anywhere in the state.
His specifications are for the very
best material and the most modern
and up to date machinery known to
electrical engineering.
Part of the machinery called for
will be used .to kift the water from
the new city wells which will be com
pleted in a very few months. . The
specifications call for two internal
combustion engines of 120 and 150
horse power, using crude oil as fuel;
two stage air compressors, one 530
foot; and two dircet connected pumps
f 250 gallons per minute capacity.
Specifications are also prepared for
the building of an addition to the
power house and the building of new
water mains, as well as the raising
of the large storage tank, as mention
ed in the last issue of the News.
The well rig of the successful bid
der on the well contract arrived in
the city the first of the week and is
on the ground where the wells will
be drilled. Work of drilling will com
mence the fore part of next week 'and
the work will be pushed to a rapid
completion.
Engineer Duerr arrived here from
Denver last Saturday and will spend
the greater part of his time here dur
ing the drilling of the wells. "
SPEED LID IS ON
fíie lid i on the speed limit. The
autoists, in the future, will meander
up Main, street at the sedate pace of
twelve miles an hour or suffer the
consequences. There Í9 a speed limit
in Clayton and it isn't the proverbial
one hundred miles if you ran make
it. There has been a speed limit or
uinance in effect for many moons
but it has been more observed by
breaking than by keeping. But nev
er again! The stuff's off.
Slats Rankin was the first victim
to the speed bug. Friday noon he
opened up the throttle on the Super
six and beat it to the garage. Right
behind him rame Sheriff Crumley in
a 4rd.
The Super-Six slowed up for gas
and the 4rd overhauled it. Crumley
changed mounts swapped horses in
the middle of the street as it were,
and accompanied Slats to Judge
Kingdom's court where the sum of
seven fifty was assessed against him.
Slats mentioned the fact that if he
could get as large a crowd to see
his picture show as to see him fined
he could afford to pay several. .

JOE GILL APPOINTED SPECIAL
PROSECUTOR IN STATE
DEWEY JOHNSON
.vs.
of District Court.
It has just been learned here that
District Judge Thomas B. Lieb has
appointed Joseph Gill of this city, to
act as special prosecutor in the case
of the State vs. Dewey Johnson.
Johnson is charged w ith the killing
of N, A. Hypes on the main street of
Clayton at about 12:30 o'clock of the
night of July 22.
It is believed that the action of
Judge Lieb, in apointing special
council for the state, grew out of
continued failure and neglect on the
part 6f the dtriet attorney's office,
as Well as the final refusal of the
incumbents of that office, to file an
information against Johnson, charg
ing him with the honiocide of the
deceased, and their failure and re
fusal to investigate the charges with
a view of ascertaining wherter the
accused should be permitted bail or
confined in the county jail pending
investigation by the Grand Jury.
Secton 13 of Article II of our Statj
Constitution provides among other
things, that "All persons shall be
bailable by sufficient sureties, ex
cept for rapta! offenses when the
proof is evident or the presumption
great.' In this case, several men
were eye witnesses of the fatal as
sault, and it would, therefore seem
that the "proof is evident". The dis
trict attorney's office, chose to dis
regard the law, however, in the face
of its applicability to the fact of the
eye witnesses, but once again the
court refuses to permit hike-warm
inactivity to defeat justice, both to
the State and those charged with
crime, and we feel very grateful for
tiiis attitude.
Teams To Help Autoists
Colonel E. U. Jacobs, president of
Hie Kansas Picnic Association, in
forms us, and wishes us to inform
the public, that arrangements have
been made for a team to be station
ed at the sharp steep hill just this
side of Big Sprngs lor the benefit
of autoists who attend the picnic
the nineteenth. , The team will be
there from three o'clock until dark
to help those who are unable to
pull the hill.
The Kansas Picnic 'will be one of
th events of the summer, if all in
dications do not fail. The comiltee
has been busy for weeks preparing
an elaborate programme and no
amount of time end money has been
spared in arrangemnts.
The scene of the picnic, the Big
Springs on the Seneca, is one of the
prettiest spots in the county and
while there will be a refreshment
stand, of course, the water of the
Big Springs is good and there is
plenty of it.
A good many Clayton people plan to
attend this picnio and next Satur
day will probably be nearly every
atuo in the city on the Big Springs
road.

Rexall Rabbit I Some Car
Milo Ratiliff has a new car. It's a
combination or rather a new breed,
being a cross between a- 4rd and a
Stutz, and is one of the niffliest, and
speediest looking cars that has ex
ceeded the speed limit in Clayton for
some time.
The hybrid has not yet been
christened by Milo but his friends in
sist it is a Rexall product and call
it the Rexall Rabbit, the former
name coming from the brand of
drugs handled by the popular drug
gist and thfatter from the speed of
the car.
The speedster is built on a 4rd
chassis and has a Stutz raidiator and
racing body. The gears have been
worked over until the ratio is such
that Milo says he can get sixty milas
an hour out of it easy.
Not being up on such question
we cau only say it is "some car". "
