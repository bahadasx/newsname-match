Three thousand people, the largest assembly in the
present campaign, heard United States Senator Miles
Poindexter, republican candidate for re-election, frankly
admit at the Dreamland rink last night that he considered
patriotism above partyism, that he had voted for demo
cratic as well as republican measures and men when they
were deserving, and would do so again.
They heard him—this gathering of men and wom
en who defied the oppressive heat to crowd into the big

plauded. They came from all parts of the county—from
Bothell. Kirkland, Auburn, "oster, Orillia. Some came
from Chehalis and Everett and other near-by points.
It wu the first meeting this year that approached
the rnthusiasm of the 1910 and 1912 campaigns, and

INVESTIGATION
Discovery that Anna Marie Danielson, of Min
neapolis, who died under mysterious circumstances in
the Sheridan apartments here July 15, was not the wife
of Dr. Percival V. Allen, an osteopath, as he had rep
resented, led Saturday to his being criminally charged
with a gross misdemeanor following his arrest at the
St. Regis hotel, at i2:*o a. m. Friday.
Deputy Prosecutor Helsell says Allen is facing a
year in the county jail and a SI,OOO fine, thru facts
by Allen's own admissions.
The present charge is said to be merely a "holding
charge" to keep Allen within the jurisdiction of the
fourt until an examination of Anna DanieUon's brain

Following her sudden death, which caused the in

Great Crowd Expected at
Arena Mass Meting
Sunday
DRY FORCES BACK IT
Thousands .ire expected to
pack the Arena at 3 p. m. Sun
day at the law and order mass
meeting under the auspice* of
the Seattle Ministerial Federa
tion for the purpoaes of creat
ing a sentiment against tho
"bootlegger" and to determlno
upon some method of aiding
Mayor Gill to drive them from
the city.
Besides talks hy Gov. IJster,
Mayor Gill, Hev. Mark A. Matthews
and Rev. Carter Helm Jonee,
there will be a program of music.
Theo Karle will probably sing.
"The mass meeting Sunday at
the Arena w ill be for the best In
terest of the city from every stand
point. Every citizen, man and
woman, should attend, it is an
appeal of the highest order to the
Seattle spirit. 1 fear that many of
our citizens are not keen and awake
as to the real issue. They do not
seem to understand that the most
vicious and slauderous falsehood!
are published In the papers of some
other cities concerning Seattle con
ditions. The city has been libeled
economically and morally.
"To read a I/Os Angeles paper of
recent date one would think that
Seattle is so low. economically, aa
to be a ham-sandwich town, and ao
low In moral and civil order as to
be a bedlam of anarchy, all because
of the dry law.
"This is not true. And the meet
ing Sunday afternoon at the Arena
will riiw; a vigorous protest for the
truth. The mass meeting will
stand for the truth that Seattle Is
a better, cleaner, more optimistic
city than it has been for >eara. It
»||| be a red-hot protect agalust the
civic slanders. And If will be a
vigorous indorsement of Mumt till!
and the city council in their efforts
to inforce the dry law.
"We believe that the mayor Is
entitled to widespread approval In
his crusade. l.et citizenship be
aroused. I*et no one throw dust
into your eyes. Sunday's meeting
is a call to the colors."
