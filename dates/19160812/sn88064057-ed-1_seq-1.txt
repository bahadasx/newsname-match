UNITED STATES SIGNS THE
DANISH WEST INDIES TREATY
The Three Islands Will Cost $25,000,
000, and Considered Immensely
Valuable to United States.
WVashington. --Purchase by the Unit
ed State of the islands of St Thomrn
as. St. ('J nix and St .John. !ying cast
of Porto Rico, and comprising an ar
chipelago known as the Danish \\':,t
Indies, was provided for in a treaty
signed Friday by the United States
and Denmark.
The signing of the treaty took place
in New York, wlhere Secretary Lan
sing and Constantin Brun, the Danish
minister, both away from the capital
oi vacations, met to affix their signa
tures to the document.
Senator Lodge emphasized in a
statement Saturday the possibility
that the Islands if not acquired by the
United States might fall into the
hands of some European power and
Involve this government in difilculties
runder the Monroe doctrine 'which
might easily lead to war," a consid
eration which it is understood has
been prominently before the eyes of
officials at Wasl..ington in their nego
tiations for the purchase.
"In the interest of peace," said Sen
atqr Lodge, "it is of great importance
that these islands should pass into
the hands of the United States.
"From a military point of view their
value can hardly be overestimated.
T;,e fine harbor of St Thomas fulfills
all the required naval and military
conditions.
As has been pointed out by the late
Admiral Mahan, it is one of the great
eA strategic points in the West In
dies.
"The population is only 33,600, of
whom nearly 30.000 are negroes
There is no possibility of any material
increase in population and annexation
•'ould never lnvolve at any time the
t'ublesonme question of statehood.
'The Danish islands, which could be
dily defended from attack, occupy
'omminding strategic poston andl
a e of incalculable value to the ''ilt
States."

Production of Cotton Decreased.
Washington.-Heavy damage to thr
growing cotton crop between June 2"
andl July 25, caused by weather condi
tiods, caused a reduction of 1,350,00'
bales in the prospective production
The August cotton report of the de
partment of agriculture, announced
Wednesday, indicated a production of
12,976,000 equivalent 500-pound bales
conlgpared with 14,266,000 bales fore
cast from the condition of the crol
June 25. The condition during the
month dropped 8.8 per cent to 72.8 pet
cent Qf a normal. This figure is com
pared'with 81.1 on June 24, 75.4 on
July 25 last year, 76.4 in 1914 and
78.5, the ten-year average, on July 25.
Hughes Formally Accepts Nomination
New York.--Charles E. Hughes
Monday outlined in his speech of ac
ceptance the issues upon which he
will conduct his republican campaign
for the presidency. Mr. Hughes as
sailed the administration for the
course it has pursued with referenci
to Mexico, maintenance of American
rights during the European war, pro
paredness and other great question
of the day. He declared for a new
polley of "firmness and consistency"
toward Mexico, for "the unflinchinr
maaintenance of all American rights or
land and sea" and for "adequate naval
efengse; adequate protection bota oa
I eastern and western coasts."
