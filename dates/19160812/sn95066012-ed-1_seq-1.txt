Little Has Been Accomplished
Through Proposals to Arbitrate
SITUATIONS APPEARS CRITICAL
Possibility that Brotherhood Threat
to Strike May Be Carried Out
Today.
New York. Vug. 12 Mediation has
railed to adjust the difficulties be
tween 400,000 railway employes and
the officials oi the 225 roads affected.
Judge Martin Knapp of the federal
board of mediation and conciliation
today issued a Statement in which be
said that the board after a long con
ference bad been unable to make an
adjustment and suggesting arbitra
tion. The reprsentatives of the employes.
600 in number, held a meeting this
forenoon and voted to appeal directly
to President Wilson.
New York. Aug. 11. Whether the
leatlers of l'Mt.niiii employes of the rail
roads of the country will make good
their threat of a general strike un
less their demands tor ah eight-hour
day and time and a half for over lime
are grunted by the managers of 235
railroad systems probably win be
known tomorrow, it was learned here
tonight from an authoritative source.
The only hope of a peaceful settle
ment apparently rested tonight upon
the possibility that the men might be
induced to accept a new form of arbi
tration although thUS fur they have
steadfastly refused all such proposals.
Their chief objection to arbitration
lias been lack of representation noon
any of tho boards provided under ex
isting statutes.
If this suggestion Is not accepted it
was said tonight the mediation board
will have railed in Its efforts and the
only recourse will be on appeal to
President Wilson to use his influence
to avert a strike.
The mediators had planned to meet
with the brotherhood men early today,
but at the last moment Mr. Hanger
appeared at the meeting and requested
an adjournment until tomorrow at the
same hour.
Leaders of the brotherhoods have
consistently declared they would not
consider arbitration under the New
lands act. ns It now stands. The rail
roads have rejected the men's de
mands and have stnod out lirmly fin
arbitration. Tho men have served
notice that rather than arbitrate they
will strike. With both sides taking
such an unbending attitude there is
no solution to the problem except the
new arbitration plan, according to u
responsible authority.
The principal feature of the new
plan is said to he i he formation of a
Hoard of arbitration that wlH give
each of the four brotherhoods a rep

MUSICAL FEATURES YESTERDAY
Connzelo's Band With Miss Bentley
as Soprano Dr. Holmes Criticises
School System.
Friday's Chautauqua entertain
ments, afternoon and evening, provid
ed much of interest to the large audi
ences which attended both programs.
In the afternoon, Dr. Holmes' lecturo
on the faults of our educational sys
tem, selections by Lulgi Cclungelo's
hand, and Miss Ethel llentley,
soprano, captivated their hearers. A
band concert in the evening with solos
by Miss llentley and members of the.
band concluded the second of the
"seven joyous days."
The address of Dr. Holmo3 in the
afternoon which discussed tin; failings
of the educational systems of tho
country was well received ami was
handled With the speaker's customary
conclusiveness and skill. Dr. Holmes
declared that the main fault of our
educators is that they have no aim as
to the product which they wish to be
tho result of their labors. In the edu
cation of tao young men and women
in the country, we should introduce a
variety of experience, a breadth of
knowledge, and a depth of sympa
thies ami emotions.
education is obtained in the homo,
in the school, and in the church. It
Is unfortunately true that tho home In
fluent e is not Hie same as it was years
SCgtf, ........ ul Lotas tut ;. d tri l
center as formerly, it has become a
mere social center anil the boys ami
girls raised therein are more like
guests than a part of the mechanism
of the home. This change of atmos
phere ol the home gives the young
man especially no sense of responsi
bility and tends to uiake him Inef
ficient Tho speaker said that the fault of
tho schools is that they have not yet
adjusted themselves to tho changed
conditions. The school must do what
the home now refuses to do and edu
cate the young people to meet Ihe
emt rgenciea or life. School buildings
should hn open 12 months in the year
Instead of it for use in training the
young element of the town and for pro
rating them to become efficient citiz
en:. This problem of the schools is ono
to he applied to every town und It is
the duty ol those who are looking out
tor the youth of America to overcome
the narrow selfishness ami inertia of
those wlio would block the way for an
efficient educational system.
Following his lecture. Dr. Holmes
called the attention of the audience to'
tho features of future programs und
announcement was made of tho ad
dress to lie given by Dr. A. K. Turner
Saturday afternoon on "Watch Your
Step." Dr. Turner was the local sup
