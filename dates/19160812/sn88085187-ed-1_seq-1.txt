MKIHATION FAILH
NKW YORK, Aug. 12. —
Mediator Miirtlii Knapp
formally announced today
that mediation had failed to
settle the railroad contro
versy.
He suggested arbitration.
The brotherhoods' represen
tatives entered into an executive
session to consider his proposal.
Admittedly the situation la
gloomy.
The opposition leaders are de
termined not to yield.
Every member of the brother
hoods' executive board have said:
"We never will consent to
arbitration. The cards are
too easily stacked.
"We conceded enough by
accepting mediation."
A prominent railroad official
today replied:
"The public seems to think the
railroads Intend to recede from
their position to prevent a walk
out. That is untrue.
"If the men refuse arbitration,
the country will see the greatest
strike In history."
After the executive meet
ing, President Garretson of
the conductors' brotherhood
declared trainmen are unde
cided whether to accept arhl-
I ration. They will meet the
mediators tomorrow for fur
ther discussion.
Many lielfrfive a break In*
e\ liable. The mediator*, how
ever, has not abandoned
hope.
The railroads Insistently de
mand arbitration,while the broth
erhoods regard it with disfavor.

Women are in the great game at last, as ■_— _■
they have long demanded to be, and sin mid
have been long ago. Woman suffrage is a
fact to an extent that gives women real po
litical power.
Whether or not that power is as great as
the leaders of the Woman's Party think, it
is enough to make the support of the Wom
an's Parly, if it could be delivered, desira
ble for any candidate.
Yes, women are in the game.
And now the question is, will they play the
game as men have too often played it—for
their own advantage, or will they play it
with a broader vision and in a more unsel
fish spirit?
The leaders of the Woman's Party, in con
gress assembled at Colorado Springs, on Fri
day, announced that the party "pledges it
self" to do its best to defeat President Wil
son and democratic candidates for congress,
because the democratic party has not de
clared fo.r a federal suffrage amendment.
They also "congratulate the progressive,
prohibition and socialist parties" and "com
mend the position of the republican candi
date, Charles Evans Hughes," on their re
spective attitudes.
This, of eourse, % means that they endorse
Hughes, but are afraid to say so for fear
of alienating such support as they might get
from the others.
But— Not long ago, Theodore Roosevelt,
the creator of the progressive party and the
most adored leader of his generation, tried to
deliver his following to Hughes. And day
by day, ever since, progressives have been
landsliding for Wilson.
There is division among women even on
the point of whether suffrage should be
gained by federal amendment or by indi
vidual state action. The Times will print,
on Monday, the views of two women now in
Tacoma —women whose opinions will count
in the struggle.
They are both ardent suffragists, but
they are absolutely opposed on this point;
and the one of them who is fighting heart
and soul for the federal amendment will
work for Wilson, and would vote for him if
she were to be in a state where she could
vote for anybody!
It is hard to herd men; but it is impossi
ble to herd women!

ML DO; FOUL
PUYIB FEARED
Heady to take a year's sentence in jail rather than face a charge
of bigAmy and possible heavier punishment, Dr. I'ercival V. Allen,
who obtained a license In Tacoma July ."> to marry Mlhs Annie M.
Danielson of Minneapolis, admitted to the authorities Saturday that
ho had lived illegally v>ilh the young woman up to the time of ber
sudden death July 11,
Charges were filed against Dr. Allen, In which he was accused
of unlawful cohabitation Other charges are pending, It Is reported.
Peculiar circumstances surrounded the death of Miss Danlelson, her
relatives allege.
Miss Osnlelson hail $50,000 worth of property In her owii name,
at Minneapolis. 1 lei- family is reported to he very wealthy.
Dr. Allen has a wife in I.os Angeles. He has lieen married at
least three other times, the police say, one of his other wives, a Mrs.
Heath, living in Vancouver, with her 1 !l-yeai-old (laughter.
The prisoner Is held iiy Seattle police authorities. His arrest
has created a huge sensation in Seattle. He is a former prosperous
oHteopath of Seattle, although Ills recent home has been In San
Francisco.
GEORGE CHAPMAN THEIR WITNESS
Th arrest of Dr. Allen resulted from an investigation by rela
tives of Miss Danielson into her death. RelallvoH and detectlvea
came to Tacoma, where they found a record that the couple had
obtained a marriage license. The body of the girl has lieen ex
humed at Minneapolis, where It was removed Immediately after her
death, and Prof. Kobinsoii of the I'nlversity of Minnesota Is making
a careful autopsy.
Miss Danielson was touring the Pacific coast, when she met Dr.
Allen on the steamer Queen, bound from San Francisco to Seattle.
The trip began on June i! 8. When the couple left the steamer at
Seattle they went together to the Waldorf hotel, where they regis
tered as man and wife. Miss Danielson was II and Dr. Allen 45.
They lived at the Waldorf from July 1 to July 5. On the lat
ter date they came to Tacoma for a marriage license.
At the court house they obtained the aid of George Chapman,
elevator man, who acted as witness while the license was being
issued.
MARRIAGE LICENSE NOT USED
No official report of a marriage ceremony han been returned to
the local records, and Dr. Allen, from his jail cell at Seattle, Satur
day explained that they had never gone further towards marriage
than obtaining the license.
Returning to Seattle, they obtained rooms at the Frye hotel.
Dr- Allen kept the girl In her room continually. Walters and cham
bermaids were not even allowed to see her. On July 10 Dr. Allen
called Dr. H. M. Read to the rooms, where Miss Danielson was un
conscious from convulsions. A hypodermic injection revived her.
On July 12 they removed to the Sheridan apartments, Seattle.
On the 10th Dr. Allen again summoned Dr. Read, saying that his
"wife" was suffering another convulsion. When the doctor arrived,
he found Miss Danielson dead.
The police questioned Allen, at the time, but did not hold him.
A super-official autopHy showed no cause for death.
Burns detectives were put on the case recently by relatives of
the dead girl. The investigation culminated with Dr. Allen's arrest
at the St. Regis hotel, Seattle, on Friday.
DR. ALLEN DENIES RESPONSIBILITY
Dr. Allen denied to the police Saturday that lie was responsible
in any way for the young woman's death.
He agreed to plead guilty to the less serious charge.
Seattle authorities are making a searching investigation of the
case. Deputy Prosecutor Hensell announced Saturday afternoon
that more serious charges would be filed against Dr. Allen If the
autopsy how under way at Minneapolis proves that the girl died from
unnatural causes.
Miss Marjory Clark Jones, stenographer la the prosecuting at
torney's office of Tacoma, declared Saturday that she formerly lived
in the same apartment house In Seattle as did Dr. Allen, and at that
time he was maintaining two families under the same roof.
