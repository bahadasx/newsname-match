URGE OF GONTINUANCE
OF CATTLE DIPPING
IN IBERIA PARISH.
KoHolutionB Adopted on Eve
of Police Jury Meeting.
Senliment Changes.
New Iberia, La., Aug 7—The
Teehe Fair Association, in special
aeaaion thia morning, |ta««ed the
following resolution« to be pie
seuted to the Iberia pnri«h police
jmy at tomorrow'« «penial session:
"Whereas, It ha« come to the
knowledge of the Teehe Fair As
sociation, that, by recent aeiinn of
the police Jury, the dipping of
livestock in this pan«li for the
eradication of ticka ha« been di«
continued, and, where««, thi« body
considéra the eradication of lick«
In thia pariah of prime neoeaaity
for the future development of the
live «took industry and that work
towarda the attachment of that
end is and will be nullified, and,
whereas, it is consider'd that ll.e
work of this body organized and
stimulated by and for the only
purpose of furthering the agricul
tural and live stock interests of
the parish, will be irreparably in
jmed, if not wholly destroyed,
I he ref ore, be it
"Resolved, that the boaid sin
oerely deprecates the action of the
police jury at its recent meeting,
and hereby petition and pray the
said police Jury to reconsider its
action relative to the dipping law,
and that the work of eradicating
the ticka from the parish be order
ed continued."
The then a-St Mary Live Block
Association has also gone on rec
ord strongly urging the police jury
lo rescind Its action of last Thur«
day.
The resolutions, passed by citi
lu
by
of
of
zens' mass meeting, follow:
Whereas, An organized aula
gonism to cattle dipping and the
general provisions of any dipping
ordinance guaranteeing protection
from tick Is being artificially en
conraged and maintained for «el
flsh purposes, therefore, be It
"Resolved, That this mu«« meet
itig stai d« squarely for the conti
nuance of the work inaugurated
by the last police jury assisted by
the Louisiana State Live Htock
Sanitary Hoatd and the United
St fite« ex|M*rts from the Bureau of
Animal Industry. He tt further
resolved, that the police jury be
reaped fully urged to recede from
its last position and enact, a dip
ping ordinance enforceable and
able to stand the test of our
courts. Be it further resolved,
that this mass meeting views
these sanitary measures as a pro
teel ion and insurance to our fast
developing cattle industry and a
practical demonstration of the
success of one phase of our public
ly advocated diversification prob
lem Be it farther resolved, that
a threatened removal of the fed
eral demonstration farm from I lie
tia palish, due to the abrupt sus
pension of the cattle dipping work
so vigorously piosecuted by Dr.
Brand and Ins able assisTAnte
would be a se'back to our agricul
tarai interests and a betrayal of a
I » »ist oommitted tons by (he pre
ceding polioe Jury.
Due to the work of ibe commit
tee selected at Friday's mas#
meeting, sentiment in several
wards has undergone a distinct
ebauge and while the jury meet
ing tomorro* undoubtedly will be
attended by numerous auti dip
pets, those in favor of a continu
anoc of the work will be in the
majority.
The fact that the failure of the
. ury to order a resumption of dip
ping will operate as a final period
to the further conduct of parish
fairs this fall and thereafter and
the positive removal of the gov
"eminent live slock farms seems to
have aroused the seriously minded
citizens to the gravity of the situ
atlon.
That the jury meeting tomor
row will be e »pipy one is oertain
and though the anti dipping con
tingent is in a belligerent mood,
no serions trouble is apprehended.
The aotion of the polioe jury to
morrow will be welched with keen
interest throughout the state, not
only by the government and the
state officials connected with the
live «took animal industry, but by
breeders as well.—Times-Pica

after dinner speaker of New Yotk,
said of the Uenmii blockadi:
"With her meat rationed out to
her at the rate of a fifth of a
pound a week, Oermauy is now
getting tired of the war.
"Hunger is the one thing that
will bring Germany to terms.
"I once saw an old eoloied man
dressed in rags with a tine ham on
his shoulder.
"'Uncle, I said, 'why do you
spend your good money for rxpen
sive meat! Hadn't you better bu>

"The ragged old colored man
answered solemnly:
•* 'When Ah asks may back fo'
credit, sar, it gives it; but when
Ah speaks here (he patted his
stomach) 'it calls fo' cash.' "

says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardul, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardul, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill mef I waa hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardul, 1 began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."

tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are tftire signs of woman
