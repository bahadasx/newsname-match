OH SETTLE WITH BOSSES TODAY
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Aug 11- Whether tie
leaders of 400.0(10 employes of the
railroads of the country will make
good their threat of a general strike
unless their demands for an eight
houd day and time and a half for
overtime are granted by the managers
of 235 railway systems, probably will
be known tomorrow, it was learned
heer tonight, from an authoritative
source.
The only hope of a peaceful settle
ment apparently rested tonight on the
possibility that the men might be in-1
duced to accept a new form of arbl- j
tration although thus far they have
steadfastly refused all such proposals.
Their chief objection to arbitration
has been lack of representation on
any of the boards provided in the
statutes.
