"Toward 9 oclock in the evening the
Germans attempted to maxe a vigorous
counter attack on the quarry north of
Hem wood which was captured by us
Friday. Their attack occurred under
our fire and cost them appreciable
losses.
"South of the Somme, after a violent
bombardment, the enemy delivered at
tacks against La. Maisonette. Our cur
tain of fire caught the waves of men
engaged in the assault and forced them
back into their trenches.
"On the ripht bank of the Meuse
(Verdun front) we advanced, during the
night, in the region south of the Thiau
mont work. In the region of Fleury
two German attacks, delivered respec
tively about nine oclock at night and

j Some History Regarding
j the Islands United States
Is Now Buying.
ASHINGTON. D. C. Aug. 12.
w
Concerning the e3tly history
of America's about-to-be pos
sessions, the Danish West Indies, the
National Geographic society issues the
following bulletin:
"Of the three small islands on the
northeastern edge of the Caribbean sea,
for which the t'nited States expects to
pay Denmark JiS.OdO.OOO. St. Thomas
and St. Johns both smaller and less
densely populated than St. Croix, have
been the scenes of many thrilling epi
sodes. Here white colonists of four
nations followed each other with be-
wilderins nrpleity during the 17th
and ISth centuries.
"More than a Hundred years after
the discovery of St. Thomas by Colum
bus in 1493 the island was wholly un
inhabited, although its excellent harbor
had been a port of refuge for Dutch
navigators during many decades. "When
a handful of French colonists, sur
vivors of a massacre on Crab Island
perpetrated by a band of Spaniards
from Porto Rico, reached its shores in
a dugout in 1647 they found evidences
of an earlier settlement, but no clues
as to the nationality of their predeces
sors or of their fate. These French
wanderers were not disposed to brave
a similar mysterious end. so they sailed
on.
Settling St. Tbomna.
"At about the time that Peter Stuy-
vesant was establishing a representa
tive form of government on Manhattan
Island some of his fellow countrymen
were establishing the first recorded
settlement on St. Thomas. These hardy
colonists met the same fate which over
took their brother Hollanders of 'New
Amsterdam.' for three years after the
town on the Hudson became New York
the St. Thomas pioneers were forced
to surrender to the English also. The
latter soon deserted the Island and
turned to the more fertile lands of St.
Martin's and St. Eustatias. so that in
1671 when the Danes, wishins to share
in the colonial prosperity of other
European nations, chartered the West
India and Guinea company. St. Thomas,
uninhabited again, was awaltinr the
advent of settlers who were to estab
lish Denmark's rights in the island.
With two brief interruptions, this sov
ereignty has been maintained from that
day up to the present time.
IIcndftinrterM of IliiccnnrrrM.
"The legend that St. Thomas was at
one time the headquarters of the ruth
less buccaneers who terrorized the
Spanish Main for so many yenrs Is
perpetuated in the names given to two
towers still standing on the heights
back of the seaport of Charlotte Ama

while on an adjacent height rises

caneers were ever in possession here.
"When the Danes arrived they were
under very strict orders as to religious
observances and with respect to a
preparedness' program against rival
colonists. The first order issued by the
governor was. "Every person who
speaks Danish is bound to attend ser
vice every Sunday in Christian's fort
when the drum heats, and on failure
of doing so is to pay a fine of 25
pounds of tobacco. Persons of all oth
er nations are bound to attend services
every Sunday afternoon at the same
place, under the same penalty.'

troix. by the United States from Den-
Parliament May Be Dis
solved, Following Dissen
sion on Islands Transfer.
Copenhagen. Denmark. Aug. 12. The
Danish Iandsthing or senate, on motion
of its president today decided to -e-
solve itself into committee to consider
the bill for ratification of the cession
of the Danish West Indies to :he
United States.
The folkething. which today re
sumes its deliberations on the bill, will
apparently approve the sale. The
Iandsthing. however, seems to have a
safe majority against the proceeding.
The result is that the rigsdag (parlia
ment as a whole) may be dissolved and
an election held under the new con
stitution. Much of the opposition to confirma
tion of the sale is purely political. It
is due mainly to a feeling of resent
ment at the attitude of the government
in denying negotiations were under
way until a bargain had been struck.
The new constitution confers the
suffrage upon women and domestic
servants and also reduces the age of
eligibility from 30 to 19 for the first
general election.

gun with sufficient powder and ball;

duty shall pay 100 pounds of tobacco.'
"The order for the citizen army ran
I thus: 'Every Saturday afternoon when

feit every time 25 pounds of tobacco,
which is to be paid at the end of the
year for the benefit of those who meet
regularly.'
The shortage of labor durin; the first
year or two of Danish occupation was
overcome by the importation of many
slaves from the Gold Coast of Africa.
The laws governing these human chat
tels were extremely severe. 'Drum
dances' and feasts were forbidden and
all slaves were required to he at home
by sunset on Sundays. A slave trans
gressing such regulations was for the
first offense whipped, for the second
his ears were cut off.' and for a third
he was hanged and his head placed on
a stake.

Brotherhoods to A nswer To
morrow on Suggestion of
Arbitration Plan.
T WASHINGTON. D. C, Aug. 12.
A President "Wilson sent word to-
day to the federal mediators,
attempting to settle the threatened
railroad strike that he would like to
consult with representatives of both
sides before there is a break.
The president was in communication
by telephone with the mediators and
asked that he be informed if a strike
became imminent. Up to one oclock
he had not received word that the sit
uation was hopeless.
The president informed the media
tors that a strike must be avoided and
that if a deadlock were reached he
would like an opportunity to talk to
the representatives of the railroad man
agers and employes.
No Decision By Brotherhood.
New Tork. Aug: 12, No decision was
reached today by the representatives
of the brotherhoods of railway em
ployes on the question of accepting- a
proposal of arbitration. They will give
their answer to the United board of
mediation and conciliation tomorrow
morning.
Ktnal Effort a Failure.
The final effort of the board of me
diation to settle i the differences has
failed and the mediators today pro
posed to the brotherhoods a new form
of arbitration which shortly after 11
oclock brotherhood chiefs and delegates
began to consider in executive session.
Saya Proposal Indefinite.
A. B. Garretson, head of the conduct
ors' brotherhood, said after the meet
ing that, after proposing arbitration,
the members of the mediation board had
not informed the men whether the rail
road managers had any specific ques
tions to arbitrate and that they would
propose that the mediators obtain from
the managers a more definite proposi-
He Indicated that the arbitration pro
posal was a general one and that tho
men were withholding final decision to
learn whether the railroads cared to bo
specific.
Xo Conclusion Reached.
"We arrived at no decision today."
said Mr. Garretson. 'The men will meet
tomorrow morning at 10 oclock with the
mediators and unless we find that the
mediators are In a position to stato
definitely what the railroads will agree
to arbitrate, there can be no further
progress in tne matter.
Fear Arbitration Award Unfavorable.
Mr. Garretson described as "prema
ture" a statement made by a delegate
who left the meeting before it ad
journed that the men had rejected the
arbitration proposal and voted to lay
the situation before president Wilson.
He said, however, that the sentiment
of the men was still opposed to arbitra
tion, a position which they have taken
on the ground that previous arbitration
awards have proved unfavorable when
applied in actual practice.
M antigen. Firm for Arbitration.
The fact, however, that the men de
layed their decision in the matter gave
rise to hope that they might finally
recede from their attitude. The railroad
managers reiterated today their deter
mination to fight for the arbitration
principle, which, they said, if they gave
up, would mean that thev wr ,...

Baseball Graft Uncovered
By White Stockings' Manager
JAMES WOOD, who organized the White Stockings baseball team in Chi
cago in 18,1, accidentally jabbed a knife into one leg, suffered an ampu
tation and went out of the game. In 1S74 he was called back by Chicago
business men to reorganize the White Stockings, and the one-legged veteran
presided as bench manager over the destinies of his team for a year.
In that time lie uncovered the Hall-Craver-Devlin crookedness which
brought about the expulsion of these players and resulted in the formation
of the National league in 1876.
