Herrick Nominated for Senator
Willis and Cox Nominees for Governor. The Slate of Both Parties
Went Through Almost Without a Break. Labor Must Wake Up

STATK TICKKTS.
Tiic following state tickets were
nominated by Ohio Republicans
and Democrats in Tuesday's pri
mary election :
United States Senator Myron
T. Herrick, Rep.; Atlee Pomerene,
Dem.
Governor Frank 13. Willis,
Rcp;; James M. Cox, Dem.
Lieutenant Governor John H.
Arnold, Rep.; Earl D. Bloom,

Attorney General Edward C.

Supreme Judge James Joyce,
A. G. Summers, Rep.; J. G. John
son, M. H. Donahue, Dem.
Out of the mass of the returns from
the sparsely 'patronized state primary
some well-defined results can be clearly
discerned. Most prominent is the no;)ii7
' Governor Myr'on'T. Herrick, of Clcve
.land. for United States. Senator.
His nearest competitor was former
State Chairman Harry M. Daughcrty,
of Columbus, who, made a hard and de
termined canvass. His overthrow was
complete, this untoward result being
due in part to the" tremendous major
ities given to Herrick in the large ur
ban centers, notably in Cincinnati,
Cleveland and Dayton, where the party
organizations acted in concert on be
half of the winner.
Former Senator Charles Dick, of
Akron, who made the experiment of
carrying on his canvass by mail, made a
poor showing and was not in any wise a
contender for the nomination.
On the Democratic side of the hust
ings United States Senator Atlee Pom
erene easily defeated former Congress
, man John J. Lentz, of Columbus, his
only opponent. The vcite given the Co
lumbus man .was, however, large enough
to indicate that a substantial protest was
filed against Pomcrcne's renotnination.
Two llcnouifnntcd Kiislly.
The same can be said of both Governor
Frank B. Willis and former Governor
James M. Cox.yho were renominated by
decisive majorities, the former overcom
ing Rudolph A. Mack, of Cincinnati, and
George W. Shaw, of Cleveland, the lat
ter Alfred P. Sandles, of Putnam, and
J. C. Martin, of Darke.
Because of the comparatively few pre
cincts that have been counted it is im
possible to accurately estimate the size
.of the vote received by the minor can
didates. Calculations indicate that the
opposition to Cox in 1014, when G0,000
votes were polled by John J. Whitacre,
of Canton, against him, has dwindled,
and it "is doubtful whether it will reach
one-third of that number this year.
"I'rotcst" Is lOniphiisizcd.
It is quite certain that the so-called
protest vote against Governor Willis will
be much larger in volume and more
widely diffused. It is not, however, as
large as expected by the insurgents Who
were backing Mack,, whose vote in his
home city of Cincinnati was pitiably.
small.
The organized efforts to retire Lieu
tenant Governor John H. Arnold, of Co
lumbus, from Republican politics by
nominating Abram W. Agler, of Stark
County, in his stead seems to have been
defeated. Agler, however, has every evi
dence of a heavy vote, and the belated
precincts may change the present indi
cated result, which shows Arnold renom
inated by a comfortable margin.
Unless there is a decided drift the
other yay, it is possible that the Dem
ocratic state slate will appear with a
couple of cracks upon its surface. Quite
unexpectedly Earl D. Bloom, of Bowl

HON. MYRON
Republican- Candidate
Hon. Myron T. Herrick, of Cleveland, Ohio last Tuesday won the
Republican nomination for United States .Senator by an overwhelming;
majority. The returns show that organized labor voted for him through

is assured.
Herrick lias always been friendly to organized labor, and it was a
pleasure to see tliein reciprocate last Tuesday; and they will give him
a bigger majority next November.
