RAILROAD MEN
TO CONFER AGAIN
WITH MEDIATORS
Their Final Effort to Avert
Strike Will Be Made
Tomorrow
NEGOTIATIONS HELD UP
NEW TOniC, Aug. 12. At a meeting to
day of delegates representing tho four or
ganizations of railroad employes It was de
cided to hold another conferenco tomorrow
morning with the Federal Bonrd of Media
tion and Conciliation In a final effort to
establish n basis of settlement and avert
a strike.
After tho meeting, A. B. Garrctson, head
of the order of railway conductors, gavo
out this statement:
Tho Board of Mediation told us their
efforts to bring about a settlement by
mediation had failed. Wo wcro asked
If wo would arbltrato nnd wo did not
answer.
TVo shall meet with tho Federal
Board tomorrow morning whon we
shall give our answer probably.
It Is now for tho board acting under
the Nowlands Act to bring about a
settlement by arbitration.
Two meetings wero held during tho
morning; tho first was a Joint session be
tween tho mediation board and the repre
sentatives of tho "Big Four." At that
meeting tho mediators announced that they
were unable to mediate the troubles and
presented a proposal for arbitration.
The railroad men then mot by themselves
to consider this proposition. Whllo the
meeting was In progress one of the dele
gates left tho hall and upon being asked
what had been dono, ho replied:
"Tho men have decided to reject arbitra
tion; they aro going before President Wil
son voluntarily to lay their side of the dis
pute before him"
When tho meeting broke up Mr. Carretson
was told that one of the delegates had
announced that the men were going to re
ject arbitration and he replied:
"That Is wrong we aro going to meet
tho mediators again."
There were Indications that a action of
the delegates made a strong fight In favor
of the rejection of arbitration, but that the
faction favoring "peace" prevailed In favor
FRENCH, BRITISH

BALKAN DRIVE
Sarrail Leads Allied Forces
in Great Assault on
Bulgars
PLAN TO ISOLATE FOES
Continued on Fats Two, Column live
LONDON', Aug. 12. A heavy battlo Is
In progress near tho Graeco-Serblan
frontier, with tho Alllos forces from
S.ilonlcn attacking tho Bulgarians.
Following tho capture of Dolran Station
and adjoining positions yesterday, the
Allies are bombarding the Bulgarian posi
tions nlong n long line, preparatory to an
advanco northward to seize tho Orient rail
way, which seizure would Isolate the
Turks and Bulgarians from tholr Teuton
allies.
A Central News dispatch from Athens
says General Sarrail has been nppolntcd
commander-in-chief of the nllled forces, nnd
General Cordonnlcr has taken command of
the French troops.
Tho drlvo has a two-fold purpose to
clear Serbia of tho Invaders and to bring
Rumania Into tho war on the side of the
Entente. With tho allied steam roller under
way In the Balkans, the last link in the
great offensive on all fronts Is completed.
French, English nnd Serbians are tak
ing part In tho new campaign, according
to word from the front. About 120,000
Serbians, constituting tho reorganized
army, nroht tho front.
The alms and expectations of the Allies
In the Balkan offensive are well sum
marized by Ashmead-Bartlctt In tho Morn
ing Telegraph, who writes na follows:
"Tho Bulgarians, even assisted by the
remnants of tho Turkish nrmy, aro not
strong enough to resist an offensive from
Salonica and at tho samo time hold off the
pressure of half a million Rumanians from
the north. I seo no reason why Rumania
should not throw pontoon bridges across
the Danube in 1916.
"In 1015 Rumania had neutrality forced
on her by the great German drive, which
cleared tho Russians out of Gallcla nnd
Bukowlna and brought their victorious
armies to her northern frontier. She could
not afford to risk nn attack on Bulgaria
with her northern and western frontiers

Fifth. Turkish front Russlnns

With the opening of the drive against

nro now upon the offensive in the' five
theaters of war. From every point
steady progress is reported for the
nrmics of England, France, Russia and
Italy. Fighting is in progress over
bnttle lines nearly 3000 milc3 in length.
In the enstern theater the Russinns
are rolling forward in Galicia, crush
ing out Austro-German resistance
wherever it is attempted. Following
tho fall pf Stanislau, the Russians are
again driving northward in the direc
tion of Lemberg, and it is believed that
tho important fortified Galician city of
Halicz has cither been captured by the
Russians or i3 on tho point of falling
into their hands.
In tho western theater of wnr the
Anglo-French armies are carrying out
a methodical advance on the Sommc
front, while at Verdun the French
have launched counter-blows which are
winning back, piece by piece, the ground
lost to the Germans in their furious
drive that was begun on February 2G
last.
Decisive blows arc being struck by
the Italians, who, having ndvanced
more than ten miles from Gorizia, aro
driving in the direction of Trieste. They
hnve occupied Oppachiosclla, west of
Dobcrdo. A report from Rome states
that the fall of Tolmino is imminent.
With the capture of this fortified posi
tion by the Italians the Austro-Hun-garian
lines on the Isonzo will have
been shattered entirely.
In the Balkans tho Allies have finally
struck and ndvices from Athens nnd
Salonica state that tho engagement is
extending over a brond front, with the
Bulgarian positions under artillery fire.
Approximately three-quarters of n mil
lion men under General Sarrail are at
tacking the Bulgars. The capture of
Doiran Station nnd Hill 227 places the
Allies in a position to menace Doiran
proper, which is held by tho Bulgars,
and the capture of this city would open
tho way for a flank attack on tho Bul
gar and Teuton troops at Gievgeli,
In the Turkish theater of war the
Russians are keeping a steady series
of attacks, although the Turks have
lately been able to win some ground
and force a retirement of the Russian
force in Persia. In Armenia the Rus
sians are continuing their advance,
meanwhile beating oft strong counter
attacks. DEFEAT QF TEUTON ARMY

MAK1K SLOMINSKY
Mario Slomlnsky, a pretty hosiery maker,
wns shot down on her way to work this
morr j by nn ndmlrer -whose attentions
sho repulsed. She is dying in St, Mary's;
Hospital. One bullet lodged In her heart,
a second penetrated a lung, nnd a third Is
Imbedded In her body and has not been
located. Anthony Romonowskl, her assail
ant, wnn committed without ball by Magis
trate Beaton at the Central Station fo
await the outcome of tho girl's Injuries.
The shooting occurred at Boston avenue
nnd Cedar street. Marie, who la 19 year
old, was on her way from her home at
232S Hast Thompson street, to the Taubel
mills, at Adams and Coral streets. Romo
nowskl," 21 years old, and living at 2E68
Salmon street, approached her. A brief
conversation ensued.
Passorsby heard tho girl tell tho young
man that sho did not want him to annoy
her further. His reply was to produce &
revolver of .32 caliber and shoot her three
times. Shs fell on the sidewalk.
Romonowskl made no effort to escape,
"lie stood besldo tho girl's body and offered
no resistance when Special Officer Damns',
who is employed about nearby mills, ar
rested him. ,
Dahms sent the girl to the hospital
Physicians pronounced her condition des
perate, becauso of the wounds In the heart
nnd lung.
Tho police say that Romonowskl has been
calling upon tho girl for a year and -wanted
to marry her. He has been out of work and
she discountenanced his attentions for this
reason. They believe that at 'the Interview
this morning the girl's positive refusal to
accede to his proposal of marriage Inflamed
him to rage and the shooting ensued. Ro
monowskl refuses to make any statement.
Bessie Mereck, IS years old, of 2630 East
York street, told the police she overheard
the brief conversation that preceded the
shooting. She was walking beside Mario
when Romonowskl accosted the latter. She
heard the young man ask, 'TVhy won't you
let me call on you 7" To this Marie re
plied, "Because I don't like you." Then
Bessie says Romonowskl began shooting.
The wounded girl was token to tha hos
pital In a motortruck used for hauling sand.
Her parents. Michael and Antoinette Slo-
'mlnsky, were notified and hastened to their '
daughter's bedside. They are respected resi
dents of their neighborhood and have three
