RAILROADS FOR ARBITRATION
Declare Principle More Important to
Them Than Any Present
Question of Wages
or Hours.
NKW YORK. August 12.?Nc
decision was reached today by
the representatives of the
brotherhoods of railway employes
on the question of accepting
a proposal of arbitration.
*.r?1l wi,o tltatr nicu'or tn

the United States board of
mediation and conciliation tomorrow
morning.
NEW YORK. August 12.?The
final effort of the United States
board of mediation and conciliation
to settle the differences between
the railroads and their
400,000 employes through mediation
has failed.
The mediators today proposed
10 the brotherhoods a new form
of arbitration which shortly after
11 o'clock the brotherhood chiefs
and delegates began to consider
in executive session.
Although at 12:15 o'clock the
meeting had not adjourned a delegate
emerging from the hall said
unofficially that the men had
voted to reject the proposal for
arbitration and to lay their case
before President Wilson.
Twelve Arbiters Proposed.
Announcement of the failure of mediation
was made by Martin A. Knapp,
a member of the mediation board, after
a conference of the mediators with the
brotherhood chiefs and delegates which
lasted more than an hour. The precise
terms of the new arbitration proposal
were not made public, but the proposal,
it is understood, involved an enlargement
of the arbitration board provided
for under the Newlands act to twelve
members. This scheme is understood
? to be agreeable to the railroad managers.
"We came to the men," said Mr.
Knapp. "with our belief that after several
days of discussion there was no
prospect of arriving at a settlement
by mediation. We therefore put up
to the men a proposal of arbitration.
, The idea is to give each of the
brotherhoods a representative on the
proposed arbitration board together
with four members representing the
railroads and four neutrals, making the
total membership twelve instead of
six.
Have Opposed Arbitration.
While the labor men declare they
are firmly opposed to arbitration on
, the ground that the decisions of the arbitrators
in the past have not given the
men the benefits for which they con'
tended they refrained from commenting
upon new proposals until formally presented.
"What is your attitude toward arbitration?"
Grand Chief Warren S. Stone
of the Brotherhood of Eocomotive Engineers
was asked.
"Concessions by bp^h sides," lie re
l-jn" '?. " iicu ? mapuic Rwra IU AI uiuittio:i
the men never get as inuch as they
started out after. In former years the
men always were anxious for arbitration.
Now it is the railroads that consider arbitration
the panacea for industrial upheaval."
One of the most important factors In
the situation ts In the hands of the
switchmen. Mr. Stone said. Nearly all
western freight, he pointed out. passes
through a narrow neck of tracks in Chicago
where "laying down" of switchmen
would block trains for a hundred miles.

Farmers Incline to Sympathize

MINNEAPOLIS, August 12.?
1 tere is the center of a group of
solidly republican states; standing
like a great G. O. P. wall
' across the northwest, which, according
to all signs, portents and
promises as now developed, will
swing to Hughes and Fairbanks
in the national elections and maini
tain republican prestige in Congress.
Minnesota, North Dakota, South. Dakota,
Iowa and Wisconsin will follow the
suit of Illinois, it is believed by com.
petent political authority, and roll up republican
pluralfties. This prospect looms
large in the face of the fact that In these
, farming communities is found much of
that intangible, impalpable pro-Wilson
sentiment based on the plea that "he
kept us out of war."
j it is existent, there is no doubt of that,
and is being reckoned with in the accounting
by the republicans. In the Scandinavian
population especially does it
streak through, like the lean in the bacon.

Classed Strongly Republican.
i But politics la politics and^ republican
sentiment prevails among them. It rests
with the republican campaigners to convince
as the campaign progresses that
Mr. Hughes will keep thtm out of war,
too, and there will be no lack of effort
in that direction.
One finds a good deal of sympathy for
President Wiison among all classes of
people. So often is heard the statement,
"was ever an executive so beset with one
great crisis after another as President
Wilson has been." The people are not
oblivious to his trials, and right here let
it be said that rigorous criticism of the
President is already causing a reaction of
sympathy for him, which one finds In

LIditorial Correspondence of The Star.
JSX I'MiiiUUOJlE W. NOYJSS.
ReprfRfntatlve Ben Johnnon acnnei
Washington of ignoring or denying th<
" elf-evident fact" that all state and
county taxes should be calculated ai
part of comparative city tax burdeni
and of thus manipulating the figures
to make an unfair showing advantageous
to the capital community.
The "so-called citizens' committee" in
its analysis of municipal taxation ol
various cities in per capita comparisons
with Washington ignores, says Mr,
1 Johnson, "the self-evident fact that thf
District of Columbia combines in its
government the functions elsewhere
1 separated into state, county and munic1
ipal administrations, and receives the
same benefits. Thus ignored or denied,
the document excludes from the municipal
taxes of th cities embraced in
its tabulations certain items of contributions
to county and state support
' for the specific purpose of maintaining
its argument that the District of Columbia
bears a heavy tax in the aggregate
and per capita in comparison with
the other cities named therein.
With these exclusions the tabulations
are easlly'manlpalated to make a showing
favorable to the contention that
Washington pays a per capita tax comparable
with the average of cities over
, 100,000 in population."
We deuy tbut Washington "receives
the same benefits" that are enjoyed by
the residents of other cities through
their state and eounty relations and
government. We deny that all state
it'lfhniit pt erntion
equitably eater Into the comparison of
city t?x burdens. We deny that we
have excluded from our comparisons of
elty tux rardem even thr nnfalr comparison
of Washington's city tax with
the combined city, county and state
taxes of other eltles. s
(1) Many of us contend that all
state taxes should be excluded equitably
from the comparisons of city tax
burdens; that taxes to be equitably
compared should be paid bv contributors
substantially in the same area, to
be distributed to beneficiaries in the
same area and for the benefit of that
area alone; that in the light of this
principle the municipal tax and the
state tax are as wide apart as the
poles, being separate and distinct in
personnel of contributors, in purpose
of creation, in scope and area of distribution;
that Washington docs not
receive the same benefit**' that accompany
state citizenship, and should
not, therefore, bear the burdens which
compensate for these benefits.
State taxes are paid that one may
enjoy with thousands outside of one's
home city the privileges and benefits
of citizens of the state, including representation
in Congress and the electoral
college and in a state legislature;
a recognized status in the T'nited
States Supreme Court and the financial
benefits which come from enjoyment
of the land grants, bounties, and so
forth, which the nation has lavished
upon the states.
These land grants amount to 186,324,723
acres of the public domain.
These money donations include more
| than $1(5,000,000 from public land
I sales, $28,000 000 as "deposits," under
j the act of 183d, and more than $63,000,j
000 under the Morrill act.
i The payment of taxes as the citizen
I of a state gives the taxpayer his proportionate
share in these financial benefits.
The Washingtonian enjoys no
part in these grants, bounties and benefits
as citizen of a state. Why should
he pay or have charged against him
as part of his equitable tax burden
the taxes which are incidental to the
status of state citizens and which are
one condition of the enjoyment of these
I The Washingtonian has none of these
I political or judicial rights or privi[
leges. Why should his fair tax burden
j be held to include what the state citizen
pays in connection with the actual
enjoyment of these inestimable rights,
j privileges and benefits?
| When Washington is part of a state
| and enjoys the expenditure within it
I of its due share of the state fund to
which thousands of state citizens outside
of its limits contribute it will be
time to permit state taxation to enter
into its comparative per capita tax figures.
"When Washingtonians are like
Haltlmoreans, Marylanders again, with
all the Marylanders' rights and privileges
as citizens of a state, it will be
time to charge against the Washingtonian
in comparison with the Baltimorean
the state tax which the latter
pays, not as a Baltlmorean, but as a
Marylandcr. When Washington has
senators, representatives and a state
legislature it will be time for it to pa>
for such luxuries in the shape of a
state tax.
Our argument for the exclusion ol
the state tax as well as the national
tax from the comparison of municipal
burdens of other American citie* with
that of Washington is fully stated at
pages 1641-13 of the Report of the Hearings
Before the Joint Fiscal Committee
and we ask for it in fairness careful
re?din?r and consideration.
(2) Many of us hold that certair
items of state and county taxatior
equitably enter into a comparison o:
Washington's tax burden with those o;
other municipalities, and that othei
Items are equitably excluded, no^com
parable benefit* oeing enjoyea Dy Washington,
so far as these items are concerned.
Statistician Beales of the census
bureau discusses elaborately and ablj
this theory in the meraoranduip accompanying
his tables which were submitted
to the Joint fiscal committee and an
found at pages 186-248 of the report o
the hearings.
Statistician Beales analyzes state anc
county benefits of city residents anc
separates those In respect to whicl
Washington enjoys comparable benefit*
and which in his opinion should be
equitably added to the capital's eltj
taxes to constitute an absolutely fail
comparative tax burden for the Wash
ingtonian. The discussion is illuminating.
p.nd several columns of interesting
and significant comparisons result.
(3) But in our hearing before th<
joint committee, we did not confine our
selves to comparisons of per capita taj
burdens Involving only the factor*
which we thought equitable and trulj
' significant in making accurate mcas

i urements. In order ta avoid the very <
! criticisms which Mr. Johnson makes, we
| added certkin columns of comparisons
'to our tables which compared Washington
city taxes with the full city, county
and state taxes of other cities. We protested
that these comparisons were
unfair and misleading, and stated our
| reasons for mo denouncing them; but as
j curious information, and for what they
1 were worth, we stated them,
i And it appears that Washington, enjoying
hardly any of the state benefltff-and
not all of the county benefits,
bears a tax burden In its city taxes
alone which brings it almost up to the
level of the combined full city, county
and state taxes of the residents of
other comparable American cities.
In presenting these comparisons of
municioal tax burdens to the joint com
i mittee, Washington has nol limited 1
J them either in accordance with the
views of those who would exclude all 1
! state taxes, or of those who would in[
elude all county and state taxes, or of
those who would include only equitable
portions of state and county
j taxflp. For the convenience of the cora!
mittee and of Congress, we have prej
sented the figures which show forth all
three views. We have compared American
cities from fifteen different angles
j or bases of comparison. Everybody except
those who are wedded to Mr. Johnson's
misleading standard of measuring
tax burdens by comparing tax rates,
will find in the figures submitted by us
to the joint congressional committee
some column or columns which he will
approve as equitably measuring the
comparative tax burdens of cities.
The infinite pains which we have
taken to avoid the exclusion from our
comparisons of any factor which reasonably
or unreasonably can be figured
in this calculation in vividly illustrated
in our table ''pages 267-8 of Report'
of Hearings before Joint Fiscal
Committee), which compares eleven
typical American cities under fourteen
different heads or bases of comparison, i
including in column 9, "per capita receipts
from all municipal taxes, plus
per capita receipts from all county and
state taxes." No one who carefully
studies this table and reads the summary
of Washington's taxation conditions,
printed in our brief and at pages
1 75 to 79 of Report of Ifearings, will
assent for a moment to the suggestion
of an unfair manipulation of the figures
for Washington's benefit.
tn commenting upon this table before
the joint fiscal committee, I said:
"In total tax burden, however meas'
ured, the eleven cities find themselves
veTy close together, but there is considerable
variation in the weight of
different elements of this burden. For
Instance, Washington's burden is heavily
on realty (14.62), lightly_on personalty
(1.38), and heavily M "other
taxes" (4.02), on* account of the census
inclusion under this head (instead of
i under personal taxes) of the tax on
the gross earnings of public utilities and
> j some other corporations. Its heavy tax
cm realty exceeds that of all the other
ten cities. When personalty tax is
added, five cities go ahead of it on the
total?Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee,
Newark and Minneapoifs?leaving Philadelphia,
Baltimore, New Orleans, Indianapolis
and Louisville still behind
It. When receipts from all municipal
taxes are compared, Washington goes
ahead again of all the cities but Chicago.
The relations are unchanged
i when an equitable proportion of courii
ty taxes is added. This results from
the fact that the census in respect to
all the cities but Indianapolis and
i Louisville (which have less than 300,000
population) had already figured the
' county taxes into the city figures. I
I When an equitable proportion of state
I taxes is added, Milwaukee and Minnei
apolis go slightly ahead of Washington
and join Chicago, leaving the other
. seven cities at a lower figure. When
, to per capita receipts of all municipal
I taxes per capita of all county taxes
is added, Chicago leads the list, with
i Washington second. (Of the fifty-eight
i cities over 100,000 in population, twenf
ty exceed Washington in this column
f and thirty-seven are less. This, in my
r personal opinion, is the most significant
of the columns in the reference
coilipitl inuno, DU mi V.I lico tlic
concerned in which the city dominates
* the containing: county. The census
r merges city and county taxes for cities
. over 300.000 in population.)
I "If, unfairly, all county and state
> taxes are added to per capita all muf
nfclpal taxes, six cities go ahead of
Washington, leaving four behind It
I (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Newark and
I Indianapolis). The lowest per capita
i In this column Is 18+ and the highest
s Is 24+. That of Washington Is 20+.
) If per capita Interest payments are
r deducted to eliminate past and to pror
vide for present and future needs only,
the showing Is reversed and only four
of the ten cities show larger per
I capitas than Washington. If only the
'general government* Item of state exj
pendltures Is deducted from the total
. of city, county ami state taxes, Ave of

rify, county and state burdens of s
majority of these cities.
In accordance with the suggestion of a
member of the joint fiscal committee,
we compared the total tax burdens
fclty, county and state) of New Orleans
and Newark, the cities next
arger than Washington in population
with the city tax of Washington. (Sec
iiage 1640-41, Hearings Before Joint
Committee.)
The grand total of city, state and
bounty taxes in the respective cities ir
1913 was: New Orleans, $8,329,390;
S'ewark, $7,569,618, and Washington
[municipal tax alone), $6,966,232
Washington's per capita municipal tax
was a little more than Newark's pei
capita *of combined city, county and
state taxes, and only a little less than
Lhat of New Orleans.
New Orleans' municipal taxes alone
were more than $800,000 less than those
-?{ Washington: and those of Newark
were more than $2,800,000 less.
Our fifteen varied bases of comparing
Municipal tax burdens were applied noi
L,ttly to the typical group of clever
large American cities, but to the grour
>f neighboring cities; to the group ol
louthern cities; to a group of typical
northern central cities, and to the general
group of all cities in the United
States more than 140,000 in population
Washington's tax burden, measurec
ay the per capita receipts from all municipal
taxes, including the taxys or
:he sale of liquor and tobacco and those
an public utility corporations, banks anc
:rust companies, is distinctly heaviei
:han that of the American cities with
which Washington Is appropriately
compared. This comparison fairly
measures the respective burdens of al
:Ity taxes. Washington's burden ex
?e?ds that of every one of the neighboring
group of cities and of all in the
south, eleven out of thirteen of the
northern central group, and forty-si*
)ut of fifty-eight of the general grouii
If equitable proportions of county {instate
taxes, representing certain item.
>f county and state expenditures from
which the city man derives benefits
which are comparable with benefits enloyed
by Washington, arc added to the
ax burdens of other American cities
wasningiorrs per capita tax nuxrien ii
still above the average in comparisor
with that of other cities. Of the general
group of fifty-eight cities, thirtyseven
are less heavily burdened thar
Washington. Not one of the neighborng
group or of the southern group, and
>nly four out of thirteen of the northern
central group show as high pei
:apita3 as Washington..
To measure the tax burden necessary
;o meet current expenses of the present
ind those of city development of the
mmediate future, the per capita in;erest
payments on indebtedness representing
expenditures of the past or
mprovements, graft, or gross extravagance
may appropriately bo deducted
n the case of each city. When this is
lone, Washington's tax burden to meet
he needs of the present and future is
listinctly heavier than those of most
>f the other American cities with whicli
t is-comparable. Not one of the soutli;rn
cities or of the neighboring cities,
inly three out of the thirteen northern
:entral cities, and only thirteen out ol
lfty-seven of the general group of
:itles (exclusive of Washington) are,
iccording to this measurement, sc
leavily tax burdened as Washington.
Washington's city tax burden Is s?
?envy that, even when compared with
:he total city, county and state tax
mrdens of taxpayers in other cities,
vho enjoy state benefits and privileges
which are denied tlie capital, it shown
ip creditably In the comparison. Its
jhowing is still better when by the subraction
of per capita interest payments
lie comparison is limited to the tax
>urden necessary for the present and
'uture, eliminating past graft or.waste.
Washington's city tax burden aioiie is
leavier than the combined city, county

;ents of this combination burden in

When interest payments are elimilated,
Washington's tax burden (even
jnder the unfair standard of measurement
employed against it) is greater
:han that of any of the group of nine
leighboring cities, of all but one of the
twelve southern cities, and of all but
four of the thirteen northern central
itties. Its burden, thus measured, is
greater than that of such cities as
Philadelphia. Cleveland, Baltimore, Cincinnati.
Newark, New Orleans, Jersey
3ity, Indianapolis and St. Paul.
The grommeut unfairness to Washington
in the comparison of Washington's
city taxes with the total of city, county
ind state taxes in other cities Is in the
inclusion of the "general government*1
item of state and eousty taxes ,1a the
tax bnrden which Washington is to

Russian Official Report.
The latest Russian official statement

s "In the region of the Middle Sereth
f our troops pursuing the enemy as he ^
i retreats from his fortified positions
- continue to advance on Weerna. In
i the vicinity of Buczacz, to the north
i of this town, our troops are continu

the middle stream and captured the
villages of Slobudkagurna and Fol'
varki.
"In the direction of Monasterzyska, we

Kraseczuv up to the village of Usiezeiione.
"In the region of Stanislau our troops
continue to cross the Rivers BystritzaNadvornaskoi
and Bystritza-Sclotvina to
the south. Before evacuating Stanislau.
the enemy blew up railway junctions
. and switches. Otherwise the town was
quite undamaged, and in perfect order.'*
Captured Thursday Evening.
The troops of Gen. Letchitzky cap
tured Stanislau Thursday evening, and
pursued the Austrians, who retreated in
the direction of Halich.
The Russians also have made important
successes in the Sereth region.
They compelled the Austro-Germans to
retire from the fortified positions of
Gliadka and Voroblevsk.
In regaid to the capture of Stanislau
the Russian official statement of* last
night says:
"Gen. Lctchitzky's gallant troops, continuing
the obstinate fight in the region
>f Stanislau, captured the town at 7:4<?
vesterday (Thursday) evening. Thereafter
he pursued the enemy, who rerented
in the direction of Halich. Several
explosions were heard previous to
.he evacuation of the town by the
enemy. On pressure being brought to

hank of the River Bystritza, and odr
detachments began to cross to the other
hank meanwhile pouring rifle and machine
gun fire into the retreating enemy."
Russ Losses 750,000
in Sdmmer Offensive,
Is Teptonic Estimate
BERLIN*. August 10, via London, August
12 (delayed).?The correspondent
>f the Zeitung Am Mittag at Austrian
headquarters in a- dispatch describes
:he enormous losses of the Russians
luring the summer offensive. The cor?
respondent says the Russian censor*
jhip passed the statement that as
many as seventy-five trains loaded
. 1th wounded were moved daily on
,.he line to Kiev alone. Basing: his estimate
partly on the official list kept
at Kiev, the correspondent places "the
Russian killed or wounded ( in the/
summer offensive at 750,000 men.
Gen. Brussiloff's plan of operation,
the correspondent adds, reckoned on
heavy losses, and three or four reserve"
i battalions, from which losses might be
replenished immediately, were attached
to every regiment.
"The Russians," the correspondent
continues, "are fighting much more
bravely than in 1915. Then the Rus*
sians in their trenclisfe often threw up
their arms as a sign of surrender without
making resistance worth mention- T|
Ing against the attacking Germans and
Austriatis. This now is most rare. The
new troops are brave and well disciplined,
and their officers lead their
lines into the thickest of the fight.
Hence the mortality among ofKcers m
.eery heavy, ingludlng generals."
