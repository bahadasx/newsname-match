Columbia, Aug. 9.?Having made a
rope of blankets and sheets, four pris?
oners climbed down 60 feet from tho
top of the main building at the State
penitentiary at 2:15 o'clock yesterday
morning and attempted to evade the
sentry. The guard on duty fired at
the men just us they reached the
ground und broke up what the oltl
cers at the State prison believe was a
general movement among the prison?
ers to escape. Kight other prisoners
who had gone to the roof were taken
and returned to their cells.
Howard Clark, white, serving a life
term for murder, who Is believed to
be the leader of the movement, was
the first prisoner to be captured after
reaching the ground. Ten minutes
later Tom Amnions, serving a ten
year term for manslaughter, was
seised. The hunt for the other two
prisoners, Clarence l>avis, serving a
ten year sentence for attempted crimi?
nal assult, and Luther Smith, serv?
ing a two year sentence for larceny of
live stock, was kept up until G o'clock
i yesterday .morning, when the two
men were found hiding In one of the
buildings in the yard,

TIIUSIASM.
Slight Inclination to Play Favorites--:
Three or the Candidates Glton.'
Flowers.
Florence, A\\y\. 8.- Farm lands o?
the Pee Dee arc as soggy as river I
swamps und us plows must stand idly j
by voters of Florence county turned j
aside from contemplation of crop!
losses to the diversion of hearing the
candidates of the State campaign par?
ty. As many us 1,000 voters attended
the meeting with little show of en?
thusiasm and slight inclination to pUy
favorites. Guv. Manning, R. A. Coop
ler and Cole L, Blease each received a
largo bunch of flowers,
j In arguments the candidates struck
their customary stride, following
i closely the season old ingredients, in
compounding body politic health prc
: script ions. The administration of Gev.
1 Manning was a favored target for pot
{shooting, Cole L. Bleuse again char?
acterizing it as the most lawless aid
extravagant since 1876.
Mr. Blease was the first speaker and
.Immediately launched Into a bitter *t
'tack upon (*ov. Manning, charging
|that his farewell speech as cbg^
niander-ln-chlef of the two regiments
of the National Guard when they we're
about to start for the border was
political ruther than Inspired by
patriotism or duty. The governor
would have been howled down at the
camp, the speaker said, if Col. Springs
hadn't threatened courtmartial in ad?
vance. From the 2,000 boys gone jto
the border Mr. Blease expects two
thirds as many votes, provided these
are "not purloined by the officers,"
he said. He had come directly from
the Piedmont and from information
garnered there he predicted there
would be no second race "If the J^ee
Dee gives me the votes It has n ?ie
past." ,1
H. A. Cooper made Ills usual speech,
of all the people. "Any man who goes
into offlec to be the governor of his
friends only and to punish his ene?
mies Is not fit to hold office," the Lau
rens county candidate told the peo
I pie. Criminals^ he declared, would
serve their sentences. He could not
! promise tax reduction, but would at?
tempt to give 100 cents for the dollar.
The only inspiring element J. M.
DesChumps has discovered in the cam?
paign is the *'rag chewing" feature, he
jsald. He has contemplated the estab?
lishment of a paper manufacturing
j plant, and he would engage the can
jdidates for the tine art of munching
! the rags for the paper tissue. "If you
i don't believe South Carolina has been
i held up to ridicule, sneered at, cussed
and scoffed at, go 1,000 miles beyond
4
your border and find out what the
other fellow says." Enough seeds of
anarchy, he said, had been sown in
South Carolina to require' 50 years of
statesmanship to eliminate.
John T. Duncan spoke next.
Gov. Manning was the last speaker,
but the crowd had waited patiently in
I a sweltering sun to hear him, and
? many crowed Into the court house
i entrance to speak to him when he
, had finished.
He had kept his promises of two
years ago, he told the people. He re
| viewed the acts of his administration
'relative to the enforcement of law,
the passage of progressive legislation
and of efforts and results to give an
economical administration. The over?
shadowing issue In this campaign was
law enforcement. Pi ogress had been
I mads in this direction and he reviewed
the Charleston situation, where from
a ^tatc of brazen violation of law a
strong sentiment for enforcement has
jcrystalizcd. No true bills were re
!turned and no conviction had for
liquor selling prior to his ad mi nisi ra?
tion, he said. His instructions to his
constables were to raid the gambling
dens and, blind tiger Joints three times
daily and once every hour if necessary.
By this relentless practice liquor scll
Ing bad been robbed of its profits, "for
rent." signs were up at some of the
stands and the good people were sus?
taining him. "They hissed me in Char?
leston the other day, and they had a
cause," the governor concluded. Just
! so long as he is governor, he pledged,
they will continue to have cause to
hiss.
Gov. Manning was asked to detlno
his position on the eight hour day
problem, now being agitated by freight
trainmen over the country. The gov?
ernor said he thought the eight hour
basis both right and just, hut ho re?
garded the matter as one for national
regulation rather than State.
John R, Sweuringen, State superin?
tendent of education, was present and
made a brief speech. Other candidates

on the au$piciOUfl opening of the third |

! ther Russian successes and of a splen- ,
did victory for the Italians on the ,
Isonzo front.
The surprising success of the Ital?
ians, who in two days have captured j
j 10,000 prisoners, suggests that in ad
I dition to transferring Gen. Koeves,
j an able Austrian general, from the
|Trentino front to Galieia, the Aus
Itrians also ventured to transfer troops
from the Isonzo to the Russian front \
in an endeavor to stem the Russian
advance.
Gen. Cadorna's victory has caused j
London great rejoicing as one of;
: the most promising successes in the
new allied operations and a demon?
stration of the constantly growing
j power of the allied offensive on all
j fronts. j
Russia's new victories south of the
Dniester and southwest of the Stanis
lau-Kolomea railway offered equal
satisfaction and the prompt admission
1n the Berlin official statement of the
\ retirement of the Austro-Germans
south of the Dniester is taken here to
indicate that the Russian victory in
this quarter is weightier than yet an?
nounced by the Russian official dis?
patches. According to an unofficial
report tho evacuation of Lemberg, the
Galician capital, has already been or?
dered.
In the meantime a new combined
offensive by the allies has begun on
the Western front, which is expected
to lead to the severest lighting. Gulle

in progress, is one of the strong posi?

Washington, Aug. 8.?The senate
late today passed the. bill to prevent
interstate commerce in prodWts of
child labor by a vote of 52 to 12. The
measure, which already had passed the
house, was brought to a vote in the
senate on the insistence of President j
Wilson after the Democratic senate
caucus once had decided to defer its
^consideration until next December.
Opposition to the measure had come
chietly from Southern cotton mill
owners, and the group of Southern |
Democrats who voted against it had
fought it in caucus and maintained
their opposition during the senate dc
j bate on the ground that the regula?
tion proposed is unconstitutional and
! would interfere with the rights of the
! States. Kleven Democrats from the
i South?Senators Swanson and Mar
jtin, Virginia; Underwood, Alabama;
jVardaman, Mississippi; James and
j Beckham, Kentucky; Culberson and
|8heppard, Texas; Ransdell, Louisiana;
Robinson, Arkansas, and Shields,
Tennessee?voted for it.
Senators Broussard, Louisiana;
[Clarke, Arkansas; Gore and Owen,
! Oklahoma, and Ix?a, Tenessee, were
absent and did not vote.
Senators who voted against the bill
were: Bankhead, Alabama; Bryand
and Fletcher, Florida; Overman and
Simmons, North Carolina; Smith and
Tillman, South Carolina; Smith and
Harwick, Ceorgia; Williams, Missis?
sippi (Democrats,) and Oliver and
Penroso, Pennsylvania (Republicans).
In order to expedite consideration of
the measure in conference senate con?
ferees were appointed immediately af
tr^the final vote, The only an^n<\iu.c?L.
adopted would*" extend the bHi's pro?
visions to bar all products of estab?
lishments employing children from in?
terstate commerce. The house meas?
ure was directed only against those cn
which child labor actually had been
j employed. i
Senator Borah did not offer the
I amendment he had drawn attaching
I the immigration bill as a rider in or?
der to force action on it at this ses?
sion.
Amendments to make the prohibi?
tion apply only to children under 11
(who could not read or write, to make
'lit apply to children on farms, and to
I postpone its effective date for two
j years were voted down.
The bill as passed would prohibit
interstate commerce In the product of
any mine or quarry, in which children
Under 16 years of age have been em?
ployed or In the product of any mill,
cannery,. workshop, factory or manu?
facturing establishment in which chil?
dren under 14 have been employed,
[or in which children between 14 and.
j 16 have been employed more thai
eight hours a day more than six days
a week, before 6 o'clock in the morn?
ing \ or later than 7 o'clock in the
evening. It would take effct one year
after enactment.
] During the closing hours of debate
today Senator Tillman denounced
j Southern cotton mill owners opposing
: the bill, and said that while he be
I
i lieved it unconstitutional he was
tempted to support it because of the
sellishness of the interests lighting it.
i lie also declared congress was too
{much Influenced by the attitude of la
I bor interests.
"I have been shocked," said the
South Carolina senator, "to see men
i
in South Carolina?rich, intelligent,
well educated men?who were willing
to swell their dividends at the expense
;of little children. The veil Of sophis?
try in their letters could not hide their
heartlcssness. Their plea, stripped of
verbiage, Is 'let the children toil that
we may live In luxury.' and yet we
wonder at the spread of socialism and
the increasing hostility of labor to?
wards capital."
Servility of present day vote seek?
ers to organize labor, he added, pre?
sented great u problem as did the
attitude of politicians -<? years ago to

"The congress of the United Slates

its brutal, ironical disregard for hu?

in self defense, organised for the

; About 4 0 days ago the management

quest was made the management
stated to the COW mitten that the re?
quest would not be granted. This
morning the committee waited on the
management to ascertain whether the
request would be granted and the
management answered that its de?

the request was submitted, was final.
This inlormation was passed to all the
