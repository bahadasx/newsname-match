Republican Nominee Accepts Invitation to Descend
2,800-Foot Shaft in Montana Ready to Back
Up General Charges With Concerted
Fire Now.

HELENA, Mont.. Aug.
tfj Governor
Hughes expects to try a new campaign
ing stunt this afternoon. He Joyfully
accepted an Invitation to descend 1,(00
feet Into tho depths of tho Leonard
copper mine at Butt.
Mrs. Hughes, who hasn't left her
husband's side through the other hard
ships of the transcontinental trip which
ha Is making to win votes for the presi
dency, wanted to gc, but It was decided
she had better not.
John H. Mcintosh, of Butte, who Join
ed the Republican nominee's party here
today, made the announcement of the
governor's underground search for
votes.
He told the governor tho trip might
prove of Interest, but he wanted to
warn him In advance that mines were
not tho safest places In the world, and
that he didn't have to accept the In
vitation. Not in the Least Afraid.
"You can bet I want to go," the
governor responded quickly. "There
aro lots of men who work In mines ev
ery day. and I'm not In the least afraid,
anyway."
Tho Leonard mine Is not the biggest
of Butte's under earth Industries but
the committee hold It to bo better adapt
ed for sightseeing. Tho governor will
be furnished wltn Jumpers and over
alls. Hughes today reached that stage In
hln nstmult on the Democratlo trenches
at which a European army commander
would report himself ready for the con
certed attack at a particular point.
The Republican candidate feels he has
done the preparatory work In the twenty-four
campaign speeches he has made
since leaving New York one week ago
today. He has Indicated that his main
reliance in assault Is the Weapon of
criticism of Democracy's alleged Inef
ficiency. Ftom now on. the govemcr proposes
to back up this general charge with

"WAR BRIDE'S"PLUj3,000 SCHOOL GIRLS
RAISES NEW ISSUE IN VICE MIST NET
Question Brought Before Wel
fare Association by Wife of
Two Weeks.
8hould a "war hride" receive help
from the Citizens' Welfare Association
the samo as other dependents ot Dis
trict militiamen?
This Is the interesting question which
has been ralBed today at the headquar
ters of the association, and which tho
members have so far been unable to
settle satisfactorily.
The question came up with the ap
plication of a "war bride" for assist
ance. She said she had been married
two weeks and thut her husband la In
camp at Camp Ordway. She said sho
had not worked before her marrlago.
but had lived with her mother. She la
stltl living with her mother.
A ruling will be mado on this question
shortlv. for the reason that several ap
plications for aid havo been mnde In
cases that are suspected of being "war
brides." In some cases, however, the
brides hod quit falrlv good lobs to
marrv militiamen, nnd havo been left
without means of support because of
the failure of tho men to get paid
promutlv. There ore also several cases
of voting women who were married to
mllltlambn Just before the call for
troops came. , ..,-
The association is anxious tp "cure
relief for a mother of two children, the
wife of a militiaman, whose sole nieans
of support Is playing the piano at an
one n-alr motion picture show. She onlv
gets paid for the davs he works, and
onlv works when the weather Is good.
Her children are four years and nine
teen months' old. respectively.
Another case In need of mmediatq
relief Is that of a mother of oyen
children, the oldest boy being tho bread
winner of the family, and havlnp been
called Into service. All of the six other
chlldten are under sixteen veara of age.

The phrase which has so far evoked
the most applause from the nominee's
auditors has been. "I'd like to have a

CHICAGO, Aug. 12. An estimated

Postnlkoff substantiated United
Press dispatches from Petrograd
stating that, efforts are being made to
lay a direct cble between Russia and
America.
He declared this was being done b
cause of the Inability to get proper
cable transmission of Russian orders
through the British censor.
He charged thnt Great Hrttaln has
been actually stealing American trade,
with the declaration that out of nftv
cables received by his company In the
last eight months only Ave have been
transmitted In their original form.
No Direct Proof.
"While I have no dlrrt proof that
Oreat Britain has garbled o ur cahlra
to throw trade to their own manufac

is tho case." said Postnlkoff.
"In tho last eight months, out of
eight cnbles from here to our Petro
grad office, and from that office to
this office, seven have been lost.
"No doubt exists In my mind that
Oreat Britain Is using every possible
means, fair or foul, to Interfere., nnd
If possible, put an end to direct trade
relations between the United States
and other countries.
"Oreat Britain Is part'cularlv de
slrous of discouraging such trnde be

"Prior to the war. Germany enjoyed
this lucrative position In all our deal

The International Manufacturers'

controversy between 400,000
managers of the 225 railroads
This was the formal announcement made today by
Judge Martin Knapp, of the United States board of media
tion and conciliation, in a communication to the trainmen.
Judge Knapp's communication read:
"In our judgment, after two days of consideration of
the difficulties between the railroad managers fnd the em
ployes, there is no prospect of settlement by mediation, and,
therefore, we suggest arbitration as the means of reaching a
settlement."
Immediately they' were handed Judge Knapp's commu
nication, the executive boards of the brotherhoods, who
have been empowered by a 94 per cent vote to call a strike,
if in their opinion such action is essential to the success of
their fight for an eight-hour day and time and a half for over
time, went into executive session to consider the suggestion.
EMPLYOES VOTE TO REJECT PLAN
AtJl:S0 o'clock It was reported thai

with the railway managers; The men,
800 of whom met In Webster Hall, to
discuss tho proposal, were declared to
have voted to appeal to President Wil
son. Admitted failure of mediation, It was
believed In railroad and brotherhood
circles, developed the most ominous
situation since the tralnmon first made
their demands on the roads.
This seriousness waa emphasized by
the statement of a prominent retired
railroad President that the roadn n-ntilrt
face a strike rather than give up their

CONVERGING ON HALITZ
Italians Press Onward Toward
Trieste No Decisive Action
on West Front.
LONDON, Aug. 12. The ad
vance guard of the Russian force
that occupied Stanislau pressed on
two miles northeast of the city and
crossed the river Zlota Bistritza,
eighteen miles south of Halite, ac
cording to official Petrograd dis
patches today.
General Letch itzky's forces also
have crossed the Czarna Bistritza
river, in the region of Nadvorna,
twenty-two miles southeast of
Stanislau, in pursuit of the re
treating Austrians.
The Austro-Germans offered
but weak resistance, and then con
tinued their retreat northward
toward the Dneister river, cross
ing at Halite.
Several guns were abandoned by
the enemy in their retreat from
Zlota Bistritza.
Two separate Russian forces are
now converging" on Halite, the im
mediate objective of General
Letchitzky in his drive against
Lemberg.
20 MILES FROM HALITZ.
The first, moving eastward along the
north bank of the Dneister. la leu than
twenty miles from Ilalltz.
The second force operating south ot
the Dneister Is composed of the detach
ments that took Stanislau.
There Is no Indication in dispatches
from either Petrograd, Berlin, or Vienna
that the Russian advanoo, the most
rapid made by any army since the Aus
tri. Germans' campaign, has been even
slowed up.
In four days the Slavs has progressed
twenty miles, advancing over poorly
built highways and crossing three rlv
ere, In the fighting about Staulslau alone
they have taken nearly twenty villages
and towns.
Battling over much more difficult
country, tbe Italians have scored suc
cesses of equal Importance In their
southward swing toward Trieste.
The news from both Petrograd and
Rome suggests that the demoralisation
of the Austrian armies may be more
complete than earlier advices indicated.
No official statement has been made
public here thus far on the activities In
the Balkans reported from Parla yester
day. No decisive action was reported
on the west front.
It Is not known whether the British
or Serbian forces co-operated with the
French tn tho advance that resulted In
the capture of the Dolran station, and
jxincion is sun in xno a arte as to whetner
the French offensive marked an early
