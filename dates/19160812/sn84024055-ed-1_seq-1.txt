HEADQUARTERS 8th ILLINOIS IN
FANTRY IN CAMP, NEAR FORT
SAM HOUSTON, SAN" ANTONIO,
TEXAS.
August 9, 1916.
Special to The Broad Ax. The 8th
Illinois Infantry to-day completes its
first month's encampment at this place,
(re-it strides have been made within
tins time. The machinery of the regi
iiu nt is now running smoothly and the
it ii .uil officers move about perform-in-j
their duties like clockwork. It
vtit'ld do your heart good to see the
, r. 1 1 sight of the bovs marching out
! their long hikes into the small footj
I )i- that surround this camp, behind!
- old famous Sth Regiment Band,'
(i .njr "Tipperary" or some good,
-iimng march. After they havej
n Ut-.l' about 10 miles or more they
r . rn to camp often with their cloth-
i' ' soaked with perspiration but al-
- in high spirits and singing as
' march. Colonel P. A. Denison, Lt.
iiil J. "IT. Johnson, and. Ma-
li'obert R. Jackson, Charles L.J
it and Otis B. Duncan, together
. i. tin Captains of the Company are
fmg every effort to make the Sth
peer of all the regiments in the
! A result of these efforts is shown
(lie compliment paid the Regiment
t In San Antonio Press, which stated
1 the Sth had the neatest and clean-
i ..imp of all the regiments encamped
. The Machine Gun Co., eommnnd-
l Lieut. Albert W. Ford and Lieut.
hard Bradley is receiving the praises
tin higher authorities for their cxcel-
i t demonstration of the Lewis Ma
- in Gun. The Camp now resembles
little tented city with its soldier
ens moving about very much like
would in any city. A Y. M. C. A.
I iMiiig has been erected on the
grounds for the use of the men with
i ir.ui p.ilnroil cnnrftfnrine in lOinrue
' men patronize it liberally. The 3rd ;
.Malion Boys gave a "stunt" night
. t night that was a "hummer" the
"ngrain embraced everything from
ging and whistling hymns to clog
1 .neing and a six round boxing bout.
I was in charge of the newly appoint-
1 Battalion Sergeant Major, Lewis E.
lmson, one of our Chicago lawyers
'.. joined the Regiment just before
left Chicago. On last Friday the
1' ".'iment was invited to give a Dress
1' rado at what is known as the
Quadrangle", the beautiful parade
sromul of the Fort Sam Houston Army
I'.-st. The officers and boys looked
s '.Midid as they marched in perfect
Til Aliment with their now clothing and
h'-Uing spick and span in every respect.
( ueral Funston was present and stood
at "Attention" and saluted the colors
as our Regiment passed him. The Rcg-
niient acquitted itself so -splendidly I
that they have been invited to give an
other parade at the same place on Wed
nesdav of next weok. There has been
much exaggeration and misrepresenta
tion in regard to the racial relation
ships between our boys and the Texas
citizens. Of course we realize that we
are in southern territory but the treat
ment is far better than many would ex
pect. There is much ' cordiality exist
ing and there have been plenty of in
stances where the San Antonians have
gone out of their way to accommodate
our. men. A few little disturbances,
which might have happened in Chi
cago, have been enlarged and dwelt up
on unreasonably. Such disturbances
however, are below the minimum. A
feeling of great resentment is carried
by the officers and men of the regi
ment over an article published in one
of our Chicago papers saying that the
uhites had held a meeting and threat
ened to shoot and kill all the members
of the Sth Regiment and that a fund
had been subscribed to pay the mur
derers for their services. It is hard to
conceive a better example of deliberate
misrepresentation with the iutent to
inflame the public mind and worry the
relatives and friends of the soldiers at
home than this. The members of the
regiment regard it as the ravings of
some maniac avIio dared to thrust his
hallucinations into public print. Be
fore such articles are published, they
should be verified and known to be au
thentic. There is no ill feeling be
tween the Colored and white soldiers.
This was shown last Friday when the
regiment marched through the various
camps of white soldiers on their way
to give their Dress Parade at the
Quadrangle; the white soldiers by the
thousands, lined the roadway and
cheered and applauded our boys along
the entire line of march. Their march
to and from the Army Post was one
continuous ovation. When the Sth
Regiment Band gives its evening con
certs white soldiers from the surround
ing camps bring their chairs and sit
down among the crowd and enjoy the
entire program. In view of this, it is
no wonder that the men resent the
publication of articles which attempt
to prove an estrangement between our
men and the other soldiers and the citi
zens of this place. Major Jackson, said
it was "outrageous".

Sergeant Major.
NATIONAL NEWS NOTES.
Brief Bits of News and Comment
On Men and Women.
BABY OF NEGRO PARENTS WINS
PRIZE.
Philadelphia, Pa. The Main Line
Citizens' Association of Philadelphia
and other organizations interested in
welfare work there, conducted a baby
week campaign last March that was a
great benefit to the surrounding com
munities. One of its features was the
beginning of a "baby improvement"
contest that was to last, and did, for
several months. The results were an
nounced on Saturday by the committee
that carried on the work.
It seemed a good idea to tiiose inter
ested to go around yesterday and ask
the mothers of the winners how they
managed things, under the advice of a
doctor and a visiting nurse, so that
their children showed so much im
provement in two or three months.
Heading the list of winners was Wil
liam Johnson of 714 Brooks Street,
Bryn Mawr.
Seated on the porch was a woman,
smiling proudly, when questioned, over
her baby and a $10 prize. She said,
her name was Mrs. Silas Johnson and
the name of the award was "William.
He showed, the investigators said, he
ought to win a prize. He is as healthy
and happy a little Colored boy as ever
heard a crooning lullaby. Mr. and Mrs.
Johnson arc Colored people. They are
proud of their record in cleaning up
their house so well and in making Wil
liam so healthy that the doctors
judged him worthy of first award.
In another house, several squares
n-?i- w!is Ktliel finttelL white. daii"h-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Chester Cattell.
jwho arc the parents of four girls and
two boys, winner of the second prize.
After that, John Smith, another &
i prize winner, was uniler observation :k
i40 Prosiiect Avenue. Mrs. William
Smith, holding John in her lap, had
two girls and two more boys seated in
chairs beside her. The Smiths are al
so Colored people, thus two of the win
ders, the first and third arc Colored
' babies.
Attorney B. F. Moseley, 6221 S. Hal
stcd street, who has spent the last two
weeks in southern Illinois, in the in
terest of Hon. Medill McCormick for
congressman at large, will leave this
evening for his summer home ,in Idle
wild, Mich., where he will spend four
or five days. Mr. Moseley feels confi
dent that Mr. McCormick will win out
nt the State wide primaries, Wednes
day, September 13th.
REJECTED OF ALL PARTIES.'
Washington, D. C The Washing
ton Herald, under the caption "Reject
ed by AH Parties" gives this opinion
of the movement for National Prohi
bition: The one issue that has made the most
noise in Washington in the last two
years is not mentioned in the plat
forms of any of the political parties
which have held national conventions
in the last two weeks. This is prohi
bition by amending the Federal Con
stitution. The Republican convention last week
heard the advocates of this great is
sue and ignored their arguments. The
Progressive convention discussed it on
the floor for several hours and then re
jected it by a vote of 5 to 1. The
Democratic convention at St. Louis
heard but did not heed the admonition
of those who want the Constitution
amended so as to make the people so
ber; and last, but not least, the Pro
hibition convention at Indianapolis de
nounced the plan as not an aid to tem
perance. Tho delegates to these four
conventions were elected by the people
in the various Congressional districts
throughout the country, and they rep
resented the political aspirations of
the people.
This prohibition question has been
discussed throughout the country, and
it has been insisted here in Washing
ton that the people, regardless of par
ty, demanded such legislation by Con
gress; but there was no command sent
by the people to their party convention
for a declaration in favor of national
prohibition.
