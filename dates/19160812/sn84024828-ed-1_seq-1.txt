SHOWING
UP WELL
I From Oatman Section Dalir Hlnr.
In two drifts east and west on the
475-foot level of the Telluride, a ma
terial that is solid ledge matter and
is identical in every apparent respect
to the United Eastern, Tom Reed and
Big Jim veins, has been opened by
three or four shots. That it will break
into good ore in a few shots there
hardly seems a possible doubt.
This is on the hanging wall. The
value's in this camp invariably are
on. the footwall and if crosscuts were
run to the hanging now there seems
hardly a doubt that the stuff would
be found as good as any in camp,
though, of course, such a statement
is merely on supposition.
George "W. Long said yesterday that
liis companw did not have what they
called "ore," but he said it looked as
"well to him as any mine .as far as
-appearances went, and he believed it
was only a matter of a few shots un-;
"til the word "ore" could be used. He 1
"believes the Telluride will take front'
rank from this time forth.
The ledge was struck in a faulted i
place by a crosscut. Then drifts were 1
started both e3t and west. In a ,
little less than 40 feet each way solid
material was encountered and the
values commenced to show. They are J
not yet to be classed as ore, but the (
indications are so good that it is now
counted as only a matter of eight or(
ten days at the outside. It seemed
that it was this solid material that
was necessary to get into good country '
and make the Telluride into one of
the near-mines of Oatman. '
There has been intense excitement
in Oatman for the past day and a '
half over the Telluride. People have J
raked the town with fine-tooth combs j
for the stock and have failed to get i
it, as it is very closely held. It has ,
caused a general boom in stocks and
"that must have been the cause of
the sudden advance in Big' Jim with
sales at 95. Nothing in months has
done Oatman as much good and the
general feeling is further improved
by the fact that Long and Mclver
control the company. Everybody
knows that this means sans manipu
lation and a run for his money for
every stockholder.
Messrs. Long and Mclver may be
slow in giving out information slow
to those who want it before it hap
pens but when they give it out it
will be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
GARTER HAS PLENTY
OF LOW GRADE ORE
XFrom Oatman Section, Daily Miner.)
A drift close to 450 feet in length
has extended the Carter property at
Old Trails. This is on the 350-foot
level. It is driven in low grade ore
throughout, but which is not consid
ered rich enough by, the management
to treat under present costs for power
and milling. When the company gets
its own mill, which is planned for the
early future, all of this ore will be
handled at -a fair profit
On the upper levels there is a some
what limited amount of ore that would
pay handsomely to mill at present
rates. An effort to find this on the
350-foot level is being made by the
present drifting and persistent min
eralization tends to encourage Super
intendent W. H. Munds in the belief
that it will be found soon. Work was
shut down during yesterday forenoon
on account of some repairs to the
plant, but resumed in the afternoon.
HEAVY RAINSTORM
A heavy rainstorm passed over the
northern end of the Wallapai moun
tains Sunday afternoon last The rain
fall filled ravines to a depth of several
feet, and spread out over miles of
country along the Santa Fe railroad.
No damage was done, however, and
the moisture will be of great benefit
to the new grass coming up over the
country.

TUNNEL PROJECT

iFrom SumUr"" Dailr Miner
Right at the door of Kingman isjsive than anything on the west side
one of the greatest mining proposi- of the mountain. The veins run close

; Stockton Hill network of veins. This northwest in a long sweep, uniting
' great tunnel scheme is now under way.
Miners are grading out and opening
the portal preparatory to the installa
tion of a big engine and compressor.
The tunnel is surveyed through the
Prince George vein, one of the largest
lodes in the county, having a width of j
nearly 100 feet, and in which great
bodies of ore are .known to exist. A j
depth of about 600 feet will be ob-1
tained on this vein below the old work- j
THE ARIZ
ings, where more than $100,000 was
taken from shallow depth in the early
days of the district
This great tunnel will reach a maxi
mum depth of 1500 feet below the
apex of the wonderful vein system of
the Stockton Hill section, and will
drain and make possible the working j
of fully 100 veins. Practically every
vein in this great system has shown
wonderful ore possibilities in work
ings above the water level, and a
number have been among the large
producers of silver and other metals
of the county. For many years the
mines of Stockton Hill kept the county
alive, the only production coming from
its mines. The Cupel, Banner, Gray
Eagle, Prince George, Black Warrior,
Little Chief and many others pro
duced far into the millions from shal
low depths and are in direct line of
the tunnel. Crosscuts will be run
across the gridiron of veins as soon as
the bore has reached the proper point
A thousand men could be placed on
tribute work and hundreds of men
kept at work on the big veins.
The smaller veins carry splendid
values in gold, silver, lead, zinc and
copper, while the large veins not only
carry immense bodies of mill ore, but
also have streaks of rich shipping ore.
In the shaft of the Prince George ore
that will pay to ship under present
conditions has been opened, the vein
width being about 12 feet This ore
runs about 75 ounces in silver to the
ton and is easily mined, although it
is the intention of the company not to
further explore it until the tunnel has
been driven past the shaft, when the
ore can be raised on and muck and
ore dropped down. The extraction of
the ore through this tunnel will en
tail small expense, and all the lower
grade ores can be rained and milled.
In line with the rich ore body found in
the shaft, there is a probability of
wonderful ore bodies lying in other
parts of the mine.
Some years ago a diamond drill was
driven across the vein 89 feet and
bodies of ore 20 feet and more in
width were pierced. This drill was
sent across the low grade portion of
the vein, but no attempt was made to
crosscut the vein at the point where
the rich ore made. The Prince George
lode is part of the Golconda vein sys-

tern, although the vein is more mas-
with other veins that follow the dike.
The Cupel is another vein that will
be reached at a depth of more than
600 feet through the tunnel. It has a
production of more than $500,000 from
above the 250-foot level to its credit
The workings are now filled with
water and the expense of opening
them up and again placing them in
workable condition would be great, but
with the tunnel entering and draining

them it will be one of the richest.
properties in the county. The vein has
ore bodies that can make a great pro
duction, in one place being. fully 40
feet between walls.
The Banner, one of the properties
of the Arizona-Butte group, has been!
opened by tunnel for a distance of
2200 feet ,and there is scarcely a
break in the ore bearing vein. Meas
urements have shown 38,000 tons of
millable ore in the vein opened up, and
there tire many thousands of tons on
the dump. This mine, to operate,
would have to buck water, which the
tunnel will obviate, and which will be
reached at a depth of close to 1000
feet
Above the Banner is the De la
Fountain, which will be cut at a depth
of 1400 feet This mine has, great
bodies of lead and zinc and will be
brought into the producing stage with
practically no effort, once it is tapped
by the tunnel. Other veins to the
north of this would be reached at
greater depth.
Along the Cupel canyon the Foun
tain Head, Blue Bell, Shooting Star,
Browne are a network of other veins
of merit All these veins center in
the Browne, now known as the Lady
Jane. This great vein was worked
some years ago for its gold, silver and
copper content It is more than 300
feet between walls and will be reached
at a depth of close to 2000 feet. Prac
tically every foot of the way along the
system of veins to the mountain top
and far beyond should be pay ore, if
surface indications go for anything.
While it may take some time to
drive the tunnel, it is expected that
great headway will be made on it
The company has ordered a 75-horse-power
gas engine, a 50-horsepower
compressor and a large outfit of drills.
With these a double-track tunnel will
be driven. A treasury fund sufficient
to do the work, or rather get under the
old workings of the Prince George and
Banner, is in the hands of the com
pany. The necessary machinery will
arrive on the properties and be in op
eration before September 1. A road
way is now being built to the portal,
so that everything will be readily
moved in when the machinery is received.

ihe mill, now rapidly neanng com-
pletion, will have a crushing capacity
of nearly 200 tons per day, but it is
not expected to put through to ex-
ceed 125 tons dailv. which, at the
start, will be the capacity of the fin-
ishing department However, this
section of mill can be cheaply enlarged
should mine production require it and
oil flotation be found a necessarv ad-
junct to a better saving, of values from

present; also with a view of having;
large standard machinery, which'
would finally be used in the contem
plated larger mill at the mouth of the
deep tunnel. The present mill equip-,
ment would later provide machinery
for one unit of the larger mill to be,
erected when ore development in the
deep tunnel justifies its building. In
fact, the entire building was planned
with a view to removal at some future
date to form a unit of a larger mill.
The properties of the company ex
tend over two miles in length and half
a mile wide and take in several' mines
and many veins, making future plans
impossible of exact determination, the
policy of management being to pro
vide, for requirements on a flexible
basis subject to quick results, consist

is equipped with a Blake crusher, 9x9;
Denver rolls, 14x27 and 12x20, and a
five-foot Huntington mill to regrind
tailings. The ore is hauled by mule
trains from shaft pocket and tunnel
over a surface trestle to a crude ore
pocket, thence over "grizzlies" to the
crusher, where it drops to a 150-ton
bin, from which it is fed by a belt ore
feeder to coarse rolls set to eight
mesh, thence to primary elevator to
Steffy pulsating eight-mesh screen

size goes to two Butchart rougher
tables and tailings from roughers go
to the secondary elevator, delivering
to 16-mesh Steffy screen, working in

secondary Butchart tables, but first
passing Delano deslimers and de
watering boxes in each case. The
tailings from secondary tables being
elevated and screened, the over-size
goes to Huntington mill for regrind
ing, thence to Wilfley sand table, mak
ing middlings. The tables make a
lead and zinc separation and all the
lead concentrates go to a Butchart
table used as a lead concentrate high
grader, working in closed circuit All
the zinc concentrates go to a Butchart
table used as a zinc concentrate high
grader. These tailings will later go
to flotation, as well as tailings from
the slimes tables, operating on a spi
got product from deslimers. The con
centrates all flow to four concentrate
bins for loading for transportation.

BIG JIM BLOCKING
ORE ON 10 LEVELS
(From Oatman Section, Daily Miner.)
Big Jim has been blocking out ore
for some time past It is running
crosscuts from the footwall, where the
drift is located, to the hanging wall
side, every 50 feet. Three such cross
cuts have been driven on the 485-foot
level and two on the 400, all being
practically finished.
General Superintendent A. G. Keat
ing has not sampled these openings
with regularity and does not pretend
to know their average value. He has
had several assays run, but not with
any idea of their being a true index
of the milling average. He states that
they are very good and admits that
the values from the drift back to the
hanging wall on assays run is as good
as $15 to $18 and, perhaps, better.
The width of the ledge has more
than held its own in the crosscuts. It
measured 38 feet in the main cross
cut from the two stations. The blocking-out
crosscuts have not been less
than that width and some of them
more. In the past two weeks 140 feet
of work has been done on both levels,
70 on each. !
The general averages of the mine
in drifting and crosscutting, Mr. Keat
ing says, has not deviated from that
of previous reports, which are that
the ore in the drifts at least will mill
$50 a ton.
In regard to a report at San Fran
cisco of any better values on the 400
than the 485, Mr. Keating says there
is absolutely .no truth in it
GOAST FAVORABLE BUT
(From Oatman Section, Daily Miner.)
Murray J. Black, who is a brother
of Lyston and Earl Black, has arrived
from Los Angeles. He says the peo
ple of the coast are very favorable
to Oatman and predict great things
for its mines, but he heard a great
deal of "knocking" at Needles and
Topock. He attributes it to the fact
that they have prospects nearer home
or others that seemed to be more di
rectly tributary to them than Oatman.
He declared the Needles people seemed
to have the mistaken idea that it
would be to their advantage to knock
Oatman, when as a matter of fact it
is Oatman that put all this part of
Arizona on the map, with Needles, and
Topock never heard of except through
the activity of Oatman.

EIS
ss,
SAYS ITS MANAGER
(From Oatman Section, Daily Miner.)
"We've mighty near got one now,"
said F. W. Dryden yesterday in
answer to a question as to whether
or not the Boundary Cone was likely
to graduate from a prospect into a
mine.
A south crosscut on the 750-foot
level has just broken into the ledge.
Assays have not been run as yet, but
the ore looks.well to Manager Dryden,
and he believes- that it will pay min
ing and milling charges and yield a
margin of profit He states that he
knows that to be the case irith a
great deal of the ore that has Teen
opened on the 500, where thus- far "It
averages better than the 750, but both
are good. In fact, he states that it is
only a matter of the company having
a mill of its own, which will come at
the proper time.
The new crosscut was started from
the drift at a point 100 feet west o
the station. From there the crosscut
was driven 120 feet south and there
the other ledge was tapped. The first
ledge has been drifted upon both east
and west, and crosscut and sampled.
The shaft does not make the amount
of water that would be expected in
that locality at that depth. It is all
handled easily by a large bucket with
an iron drop-valve.
The Boundary Cone is the connect
ing link between the Pioneer region
on the west and the Lexington-Arizona,
Lucky Boy, Pictured Rock and
others of merit on the east. It has
the, deepest workings in the camp, ex
cepting the Goldroads and Tom Reed,
which are down 1650 and 1400 feet,
respectively.
JUDGE W. E. SORRELLE
From Chloride Section Dailr Maed
Mr. W. E. Sorelle, who has been in
specting the district for the past three
weeks in the interest of good Nevada
and Montana money, left for his home
in Pasadena on Friday. The judge ex
pressed himself as much pleased with
the outlook here, and thinks that with
development he will have a big camp.
He says: "The Herald has diagnosed
the conditions here in a fair manner,
and has not used too much red paint"
I like the mineral showing, I like the
climate and I like the folks, and expect
to return soon, possibly to make
Chloride my headquarters for some
years," said he.
His opinion will carry weight where
he is known, for he has had extensive
mining experience in Colorado and Ne
vada. In the former state he was one
of the owners of the famous Jumbo
mine at Rico, which produced up in
the big figures, and he knows what
big deposits of sulphide ores mean in
a financial way.

Fro ai CUorida Section Dailr Mlner.J
As the work of cleaning out the old
Empire goes on, unexpected workings
are disclosed, showing that the early
Chloriders were busy getting out high

seldom did any extra development

any false motions which involved a
