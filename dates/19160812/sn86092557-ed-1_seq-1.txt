SENT SLAB OF BACON
AS FIRST CLASS MAIL
LONDON, July 12.?(Correspond
ence of The Associated Press)?The
*raost Interesting museum In London
is not open to the general public. It
Is the museum of the censor and con
tains a collection of most curious ex
hibits which represent attempts thai
have been made to evade the British
naval blockade since the outbreak of
the war.
"Moat of these exhibits from the
United States where thousands of
people of German extraction have des
patched all sorts of useful things to
friends and relatives in the Father
land. Many of the exhibits indicate
the pains and ingenuity of the send
ers; in some Instances they made a
pound of lard look like a copy of the
morning paper or a packet of pure
rubbar like a bundle of narcissus
bulbs.
I A side of bacon weighing forty
i pourds Is mute evidence of the" at
I tempt made by a St. Louis man to
j assuage the hunger of some friends
I or relatives In what was undoubtedly
his former home town. In his anxiety
| to get the bacon to Germnny this man
! sent it by first class mail and attach
ed stamps to the bacon itself to the
I value of nearly %'.
There are many other instances In
which the stamps on the packagoo by
far exceed the value of the contents.
Many parcels duplicate covers. They
are addressed to someone in u neu
tral country, whose business it Is to
pull off one cover and repost them to
the German or Austrian address re
vealed below.
An enterprising Buffalo man sent a
largo number of letters each contain
ing a sheet of pure rubber. Rubber
has been a scarce commodity in Ger
many for more than a year and ef
forta- have repeatedly been made to
get thorugh the blockade all sorts of
these articles. Once in Germany the
rubber would be sent to a central de
pot where it ultimately would have
emerged as rubber tires.
This censor's museum contains
huge bundles of newspapers or what
appeared at first glance to be news
papers. Closer inspection reveals
that the neatly rolled ends an but
cleverly made plugs of paper and
wood. When one of these plugs is
pulled out theere is uncovered a long
sausage-shaped bag of calico contain
ing anything from rliced ham to Para
rubber, from rice to tobacco.
Two iron crosses are not the least
interesting of the exhibits. They are
the original article and were being
sent from Germany to a child in' the
United States. The consigner was
mak.r ? f the crosses, the head of the
firm that supplies them to the Ger
man government, and in an accom
panying letter no suggests that the
recipients wear them.
SIiocb are the most numerous of the
exhibits and most of these come from
the United States.
In several cases they are wrapped!
carefully in a piece of best sole leath
er.
All these things, neatly laid out and
ticketed, are merely samples of large
contraband cargoes that have found
their way Into the hands of the Brit-1
ish authorities. They are not confls-,
cated but will some uay get to their
proper destination, only at present the i
British government has "interned"
them.
WANTS PITILESS
PUBLICITY IN ALL
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
Hughes Promises Nothing
Will Be "Pulled Off"
Next Term.
(By Associated Press.)
HELENA, Montana. Aug. 12?Two
speeches, one here and one at Butte,
i and a trip of 2S00 feet below the sur
face Into the working of a copper mine
are on today's program of Charles E.
Hughes, republican candidate for pres
ident.
Mr. Hughes addressed an audience
here today leaving for Butte. shortly
after tlnishing his speech.
Mr. Hughes continuing his attacks
on the administration for its appoint
ments today charged Secretary Mc
Adoo "upon reliable Information" with
having replaced Henry W. Piatt for
merly confidential secretary to John
D. Carlisle with Daniel E. Finn son of
Battery Dan Finn a Tammany leader
as assistant appraiser of merchandise
in New York.
Last evening Mr. Hughes address
ing a chntauqua in the village squaro
at Billings, prefaced his advocacy of
a protective tariff with the declaration
that if ho should ho elected President
nothing would be pulled off for pri
vate benefit and at the public expenso
if ho could help it. Mr. Hughes also
adopted a Democratic slogan of tho
1912 campaign?"Pitiless Publicity.'
"I desire that In all wq do in this
campaign," Mr. Hughes said, "to have
what was called a little while ago.
four years ago 'pitiless publicity.' I
want pitiless publicity with respect to
the pork barrel and with respect to
the sectionalism and extravagance and
wastefulness of this administration.
"I want pitiless publicity with re
spect to tho incompetence of tho np
pointees of this administration. Let
us see that we have an American first
in the hearts of every American, of
whatever race or creed, and also Amer
lea equal to her tasks?America effi
cient."
Mr. Hughes also assailed the admin
istration for having changed its tarlfT
views since 1912 and repeated his dec
laration in favor of a protective tar
iff whose enactment and enforcement
should be left to the Republican par
ty.
"I desire to see a proper attitude to
ward business In this country." ho
continued. "I have done my share in
attempting to correct abuses, and what
I havo just said must be supplement
ed by the remark that if I am elected,
there will be nothing pulled oc for pri
vate btneflt at tho public expense If
I know it and can prevent it.
"I am not in this campaign and I
have not loft tho caree rof my choico
to pay poitlcs for anybody. I am here
simply because 1 have been summoned
by the American people at least to
give them a chance to choose for me
such service as they desire.
"If r am chosen I propose to devote
whatever ability I possess to having
things done right in this countrv and
I shall not prostitute the offices of
the United States for rewards of in
competent persons.
"I havo had something to do with
cutting out abuses, but 1 believo that
In this country w0 must be* strong
enough and ablo enough to prevent
abuses, to prevent injust discrimina
tion, to prevent monopolistic purpos
es; fearlessly to provent any action
Inimical tt the public interest while at
the same time we encourage honest
American enterprise, sook an expan
sion of our trade, endeavor to have

i now in the Bodleian. Merle did not
j trouble himself with the popular lore

an accurate record of fact, in the spirit

On exhibition in the E. C. Jones

erecting a more commodious house of
worship. The paintings cleverly
portray the edifice in the most minute

are the work of a local artist who is
doing the work wti> the obpect of
raising money to be applied on the
church fund. Copies of the pictures
can be secured in tow sizes anil or

Party Names Explained.
The American party names, "Repub
lican" and "Democrat" seem to convey
distinction without difference to the
English mind. As with o'ther party
names, however, their significance may
be extricated from their history. The
original "Republicans" were actually
the ancestors of the present Demo
crats. Jefferson's party appropriated
to-themselves the name of "Republic
ans," suggesting that the Federalists
were anti-Republican. The Federal
ists then nicknamed the JefTerson
party "Democrats," and the hostile
nickname, as with our own Whig and
Tory, was eventually adopted with
pride by the JeiTersonlans themselves.
Meanwhile the Federalists were long
known as Whigs. The modern Repub
lican party deliberately adopted Its
name when the various antlslavery
sections coalesced in Lincoln's time.?
