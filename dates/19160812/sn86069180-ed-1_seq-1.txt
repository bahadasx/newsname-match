FEROCITY OF ENGLISH SOLDIERY
A frail, slim girl, little more than
a child, but with a courage and
determination rare in even those of
maturer years, arrived in New York
a few days ago,, having eluded the
vigilance of England's port wardens,
crossing flrt the Irish Sea and later
slipping past the watchful eyes of
the Inspectors and secret servico
agents at Liverpool. She is Nora
Connolly, daughter of the Irish
hero-martyr, James Connolly, Com
mandant of the rebel troops In Dub
lin during tho most eventful Easter
week that Ireland has knQwn since
"Brian smote tho Dane" at Clontarf.
The story told of her father's
treatment by the British authorities
Is the most infamous to be found
even in British annals. Told In her
simple, unassuming way, it is a
powerful arraignment of English
rule In Ireland. It Is a chronicle
of events that will shock the con
science of civilization as it has not
been shocked since the exposure of
British and Belgian atrocities in the
Putamayo and the Congo.
That such wanton cruelty could
be perpetrated in the twentieth cen
tury is almost unbelievable, and
England's apologists can not explain
away the malice or the vengeful
ferocity of .her 'military officials In
dealing with a wounded foeman whb
had honorably surrendered wearing
the uniform of his own country
and having scrupulously observed
every tenet of international law gov
erning his situation. Speaking of
her father's execution Miss Con
nolly said:
"They took him on a stretcher
from Dublin Castle early Friday
morning, May 12, because he
couldn't walk on account of his
wounds, and;, carriedhuntoJCt
malnham "Jail, four " miles away.
They propped him In a chair be
cause he couldn't stand and then
shot him dead. Then they took
his body to the Arbor Hill barracks,
threw It Into a common trench with
tho other dead patriots and covered
his body with quicklime. They re
fused to give up the body. They
would not even pormlt us to pro
vide a coffin. That was. my father's
end.
"Father had been directing opera
tions with the Postofflce as his
headquarters. On Saturday ho was
wounded in the foot, the bullet
the bones. He pulled
o tho Postofflce, but
ras captured
.the
a farewell kiss and mother seemed
to turn to stone. They led us away.
Wo went home and mother stood
by tho window moaning through
the rest of the night. That was tho
last we saw of father. After niuclt
difficulty we obtained his pocket
book containing money and papers.
At first they couldn't find It, aild
when they did they didn't want to
give It to us because it mlcht ho
useful as evidence, evidence against I
a man who lies In a common pit in 1
the square of Arbor Hill military
barracks with his follow patriots."'
FEAST OK ASSUMPTION.
Next Tuesday Catholics will cele
brate with religious fervor the
Feast of the Assumption of tho
Blessed Virgin Mary.
From the very beginning Holy
Church has been accustomed to
celebrate the anniversary of tho
death of the saints and elect with
special solemnity. On these days
a sacred joy Is expressed In her
songs; her greetings, her thanks
givings and prayers ascend to
heaven like clouds of frankincense.
But if tho church celebrates the
anniversary of tho death of the
blessed with such great -festivities,
how will she not exult In Jubilation,
praise and thanksgiving on the day
on which the Queen of saints left
this earth to reign at the right hand
of her Divine Son over angels and
saints. An elect soul departing
from the world is merely a pilgrim
returning to his fatherland, a vic
torious champion now crowned with
his laurols, a weary laborer receiv
ing the wages from his Master, a
prisoner breaking his chains, an
exile returning to his country, a
loving child eagerly hastening to Its
father's embrace.
But when the Blessed Virgin
breathed forth her last sigh she
was a Queen of wealth, grandeur
and splendor, coming from a dis
tant kingdom to take possession of
her throne; she was the most beau
tiful, most pure, most lovely spouse,
coming to enjoy the embraces of
her Divine Bridegroom; she was the
happiest of mothers, coming to
share with her Son the power, tho
glory and tho kingdom. When the
Blessed Virgin died she was the
most beautiful Illy, taken from the
midst of thorns and placed In the
garden of heavens; she was the
mysterious rose transplanted from
tho desert into the celestial para
dise; she was the chosen daughter
of God the Father, the mother of
God tho Son, the spouse of the Holy
Ghost, the mistress of angels, the
mediatrix of men, the treasurer of
God's graces. Mary is the blessed
among women, who, like the glean
ing aurora, rises up to tho palace
of the great King, eternally to reign
over all creatures.
At the sweet summons of her
Divine Son this Blessed Mother
leaves, .thlajjiinhospltable arth ;u her
heart, consumed with- the "fire of
love, throbs for the last time; her
pure soul separates itself from her
Immaculate body; her earthly life
is ended and her eternal royalty
has begun. Tho Assumption of the
Blessed Virgin is her great day of
triumph, her glorious day of honor.
On this day she received from tho
hands of the Triune God the crown
and scepter, to reign as Queen over
all angels and saints, and through
her all-powerful intercession to be
the mediatrix between heaven and
earth. Is there a soul who sincerely
loves Mary who would not celebrate
this sublime feast with ardent de
votion, or who would neglect to
thank God for tho hQnor, glory and
bliss which He, on this day, be
ared on his glorious mother?

The official count of the votes
cast, or announced as cast, in the
Republican primary is now a matter
of record, but the talk concerning
the rough work pulled off by the
Searcy-Chlltori-machlne,friwb6halPori
Owens and the other candidates
will not down and, as ono citizen
aptly expressed it the other day.
was "that the only difference be
tween Jesse James and the Searcy
Chilton machine workers was1 that
the former wore a mask." Realizing
that the returns would not bear in
vestigation the Herald slyly ne
glected to publish precinct returns
on account of their glaring falsity,
but contented itself with repeating
over and over about the large num
ber of votes cast 6,000, count 'em,
6,000, as the press agents say.
Strange to say the Evening Post
refused, to accept the challenge of
the Herald when the latter dared
tho Post publishers to find anything
wrong in the primary voting, but
tor some unknown reason the chal
lenge was not accented. th Horaid
getting away with their bluff, for
uiuu was, pure and simple. Just
glance at a' few of the following
returns to see if the former Bull
Moose organ Is such a staunch be
liever In "honest elections."
In several preclnct3 tho Searcy
Chilton machine had their shut-out
twlrlers In the box, as is shown by
the following: Sixth ward, Twenty
ninth precinct, Owens 14, Ryan, 0;
Thirty-ninth precinct, Owens 12,
Ryans 0.- In tho same precincts
Lucas, the machine candidate, beat
Conkllng 14 to 0 and 13 to 1. In
tho Eleventh ward the third pre
cinct shows Owens 6, Ryan 0, Lucas
4. Conkllng 0; tho Thirty-seventh
precinct returns the same way by
votes of 6 to 0 and 7 to 0.- The
Forty-second precinct was a more
one-sided shut-out, fcelng as follows,
Owena 11, Ryans 0; Lucas 14,
Conkllng 0. In the Thirty-third
precinct of the Thi'rd ward, Owens
34, Ryans 3; Lucat' 30 and Conk
llng 0. Searcy and Chilton must
have chuckled in great glee over
the way their workers In the Eighth
and Ninth wards threw the harpoon
into Joe Conkllng, a life-long Re
publican, but opponent of the pres
ent party controllers. Mr. Conkllng
being a resident of this district,
took a personal interest in these
wards in behalf of Dr. Ryans and
his brother, Roscoe Conkling, who
was the anti-machine candidate for
the nomination for City Court
Prosecutor. Incidentally Mr. Conk
llng Is well thought of here by all,
but the machine workers 'discounted
his popularity as follows: Eighth
ward, First precinct, Lucas 9, Conk
llng 0; Third precinct, Lucas 16,
Conkling 0; Sixth precinct, Lucas
28, Conkling 3; Seventh precinct,
Lucas 15, Conkllng 2; Tenth pre
cinct, Lucas 17, Conkling 2, Owens'
majority over Ryans being in the
same proportion.
In tho other half of this district
the Ninth ward furnished the prize
precinct of Jefferson county. In
the Nineteenth precinct of this ward
the returns showed Owens 88,
Ryans 4; Luca 90, Conkling 0.
Nothing short about the Lucas
workers In this precinct, all or none
being their motto. The Seven
teenth of the same ward was about
the same ratio, Owens 21, Ryans 2;
Lucas 21, Conkllng 0. It can be
seen . from the above that the
Searcy-Chilton machine set out to
punish Joe Conkllng for Insubor
dination, and the awful grueling
given his1 brother In Joe's home
district and ballwlek ie proof that
the local Republican machine will
stop at nothing. The same tactics
aro sure to be repeated next year In
behalf of Axton for Mayor and tho
entire ticket of Axton followers.
Out in the county the "honest elec
tion workers" were also In form,
tho following being some of the re
turns; Harrod's Creek, Owens 39,
Ryans 2; Boston, Owens 16, Ryans
0; Fisherville, Owens 32, Ryans 0.
The next sounds like the work of
former Bryanltes: Cross Roads:
Owens 16, Ryans i; Hokes, Owens
85, RyanB 3; Middletown, Owens
32, Ryans 1; O'Bannon, Owens 47,
Ryans 2; (No ono will be nblo to
convince Dr. Ryans and his friends
that the next precinct Is not aptly
named.) Robbs, Owens 80, Ryans 3.
There was little If any Interest In
the primary- and the statement of
the Herald that nearly 6,000 votes
was cast Is laughable, tho returns
showing that where the vote was
normal and no padding done there
was not over an average of twelve
votes cast. With tho entire ma
chinery in Its power the machine
could do as It pleased, this control
being made by the eleventh hour
swap of the nominee for State Sen
ator, Theodore DIohl. Apropos of
tnis, it is told by Dr. Ryans' friends
that when the latter called on the
last Legislature In behalf of a labor
measure Dr. Ryans took him In
tow, Introduced him around and
materially helped him with tho
labor legislation. In return for his
kindness Dlehl deserted him and
helped the Searcy-Chilton machine
In Its effort to get control of the
olectlon officers.
The Evening Post Thursday pub
lished a call, signed by 125 citizens,
requesting Messrs. Humphrey and
Barrett to again offer for re-election
as members or the Board or
Education. As stated before in
these columns, tho average voter,
Republican, Democrat or Inde
pendent, rebels at this method of
selecting candidates for office, the
compulsory primary laws .through
out the country being a striking
proof. There is nothing to be said
against either the candidates or the
gentlemen who signed tho call, but
the method of selection by a few,
with a sort of defi to the public at
large, "take 'em or leave 'em,"
won't down, and many hope others
will take advantage of the editorial
in the Post, which states that "any
one who cares to fight has that
privilege." Another candidate in
the field Is Mr-. Ben W. Kllng, a
gentleman of unimpeachable char
acter, who deserves support as a
rebuke for the present undemocratic
method of selecting our school rep
resentatives and as an additional
protest against tho attempted grab
by the present board of more than
their allotted share of the city
taxes.
SOLEMN SEKVICE.

The ceremony was in charge of the

For Brutal Execution of

HfATTERSON ATTACKS TORIES
The British Government is being
roundly censured In every part of
tho civilized world for Its brutal
execution of Sir Roger Casement,
many English sympathizers con
demning British officialdom for its
shortsightedness. Following aro
some of the comments in the United
States:
Mayor Curley, of Boston, said:
A similar tragedy to the present
ono in the case of Robert Emmet
has been responsible for fanning
into flame a spirit of hatred of tho
English Government on the part or
tho Irish people for more than a
century. In every portion of the
world whore Irishmen nro fmm.i it
is customary to commemorate the
anniversary or Robert Emmet on
the tourth day of March, to renew
pledges of realty to the movement
for Irish Independence and to re
view every act or tyranny, oppres
sion and bloodshed or tho English
Government during a period ot
seven centuries."
"Barbarism rrom barbarians is all
we could have expected, I suppose.
Brutes! Brutes'". was the comment
or Senator Martlne, or Now Jersey,
author or tho Senate resolution urg
ing clemency Tor Roger Caseemnt,
when he read of Casement's execu
tion. Says the New York World: "If
the British Government had not
broken faith with Ireland there
would havo been no Casement af
fair. If It had not proved false to
Its pledges, Ireland today would not
be a hotbed of sedition or hold un
der martial law. The passage of
the homo rulo bill was a solemn as
surance to Ireland that it was at
last (to be,, granted tho powers . of
Beir-goVefanieSt.eS'rhe 'bill -was tho
culmination or a long political'
struggle by which the Liberal party
uuu jimmy jusunea tne confldenco
or Irish Nationalists in Its loyalty
to their cause. But in the first
weeks or tho war Mr. Asqulth and
his associates in the Government
undid the work accomplished in be
hair or Ireland. The definite prom
ises embodied In an act or Parlia
ment were withdrawn. Home rulo
was deferred for nobody knew how
long. Ulster, which had threatened
civil war, was put in the saddle.
Sir Edward Carson, the organizer
of rebellion, was rewarded with
Cabinet rank. The Irish had been
grossly deceived. They had been
cheated or their rights. The Gov
ernment that they had been taught
to trust had deserted them for the
friendship or tho enemies or homo
rule. In the circumstances it was
natural that conspiracy should
thrive In tho soil or Ireland. Tho
British Government by its cynical
disregard of its own hbnor and its
stability of purpose had prepared
tho field for this."
In commenting on tho above from
the New York World Henry Wat
terson, of the Courier-Journal, who
has been active in denouncing Ger
many, changes front and Includes
England in that . denunciation as
follows:
"Nothing could bo truer. Tho
precipitancy with which the Irish
rebels more crazy than culpable
were rushing to death, is proof that
the Tories of England are no better
than the Junkers ot Germany, nor
the English Government behind tho
German Government in despotic
bloody-mlndedness. Each or them
