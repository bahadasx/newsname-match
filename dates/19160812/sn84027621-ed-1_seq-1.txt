HAMPSHIRE HOGS
Movement Well Under Way to Make
this Excellent Breed Preferred

R. W. Blacklock, county demonstra
tion agent, is today ordering 46 head
of Hampshire hogs, through the Na
tional Hampshire association, as a
f starter in the movement to make Ma
rion county famous for this breed.
Thus far, 23 boys have agred to take
hogs under the plan promoted by the
banks of the county. The hogs will
be paid for out of the $1,000 fund pro
vided by the banks, and each boy will

12 months. Besides the boys 23 farm
ers are getting Hampshires through
' Mr. Blacklock. The Muclan farms are
