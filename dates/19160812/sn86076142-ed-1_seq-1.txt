MEDIATORS' f AIL AND ONE HOKE SUGGESTION IS HADE
President Wilson Appeals
For a Personal Hearing
Before Shutdown Ordered
I Br Aaaorlatrd Praia.)
NEW YORK, August 12. A final
effort of the United Stntes Hoard of
Mediation and Conciliation to settle
differences bet wen the railways and
their employes through mediation has
failed. The mediators proponed a
new form of arbitration which the
brotherhood chiefs have taken under
consideration. No decision was
reached today by the brotherhoods,
which will answer tomorrow.
Upon the decision of the employes
whether the proposed new form of
arbitration is accepted dupcnds the
question of calling a nution wide
strike. If the offer is refused tho
only cuanco of preventing a strike
rests with President Wilson, who
might bring the disputants together.
The precise terms of the proposed
arbitration were not made public.
It Is understood they Involve enlarge
menl'of the arbitration board under
the Newlands act to twelve members.
This Is believed to be agreeable to
the railroad managers.
It was reported this afternoon that
there is little prospect of the railroad
managers Informing the mediators ou
what terms they are ready to arbi
trate. The belief prevails that only
the good offices of the president can
prevent a strike.

WASHINGTON, August 12. The
president has sent word to the media
tors attempting to settle the threat
ened railway strike that he wishes

Informed the mediators that a strike
must be avoided and if a deadlock is
reached that he desired an oppor
tunity to talk to the railway man
agers and the employes' representatives.

TURKS COMPELLED TO
FLEE EAST OF SUEZ!;

AND i ENTIRE AUSTRO-GERMAN ARMY IN PERIL
I Hy Aaaorlatrd Prraa.)
PETKOGRAD, August 12. Follow
ing the capture of the important rail
way Junction of Stanislau, in Galicia,
Gen. Letchltsky Is pressing with un
abated vigor his - movement to furn
to the right flank of the 'army of
Gen, Von Bothmer. Halicz, 16 miles
north of Stanislau, appears likely
to fall soon.
The Austrlans, who felt back there,
were pursued closely by the Russian
cavalry, which Is giving the Teutonic
forces no time to reform their dis
ordered ranks or prepare to make a
serious stand.
Halicz has always been regarded
as the key to Lemberg and once the
Russians possess that town they have
no natural obstacles and with plenty
of good roads to Lemberg.
The capture of Monasterzyska, ten
miles north of the Oneister, broadens
the line of attack on Hallos. The
wedge is being driven relentlessly
back of Von Dot timer's Tarnopol po
sition, promising to put this force in
a position from which he will have
difficulty In extricating it.
South of Brody, Gen. Sakaroff Is
gradually turning Von Bothmer's left
flank and threatens Interruption of
railway communication along the
Tarnopol-Lemberg line.

Much of the opposition to confirma

economic grounds, but purely due to
a feeling of resentment against the

denying them until the very moment
