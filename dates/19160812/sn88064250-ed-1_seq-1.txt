CARGE AND CHALLENGE TO

"Is it not a fact that the law,
Sec. 16 of Act 170 of 1898, re
;quires the assessor to person
ally or by deputy visit the
. residence or domicile of every
taxpayer, whether individ
Ithere take their signed and
sworn assessment?
"Have you complied with this
law by going out yourself or
,sending out a single field
d'leputy for this year?
"Of the scores of newcomers
into the parish, how many
have you placed on the roll,
either as to property, poll or
road tax?
UDoes not every dollar thus
left off affect injuriously
our schools, our roads and
the finances of the parish?
,lave you not in fact for this
year copied verbatim the pre
., ceding roll, except where the
itaxpayer took the trouble,
. which the law does not re
,qaire of him, to come to your
!'"office and make the necessary
changes?
OIt has been charged and never
:`been denied, to my knowledge,
that if you are elected sheriff
you have already selected and
agreed with Charles Chachere
ithat he shall retain the posi
ion as Chief Criminal Deputy,
which he held under the late
:lamented Marion Swords. Do
ya consider that Mr. Cha
'ehere's record justifies his re
" ition in that position?.
!4s not such parceling and di
viding up of the high offifee
v of sheriff in advance of the
'leetion, again a plain viola
41on of the law on the subject?
Now, Mr. Fontenot, you may
i" aswer this in writing if you
vWish, but inaddition I invite
d challenge you to meet me
before the people on Monday
.fIght, the 14th, on the Court
louse Square at Opelousas,
ald there answer the people
W o have given you your com
.son twice, and answer me
all the above points, if you
van. You will be given full
'pportunity and time to ex
plain to the people and the
taxpayers of St, Landry, why,
if these charges I make are
true. you have abused their
confidence, violated the plain
letter of the law; and ne
glected grossly your 'duties as
assessor For I will at that
time repeat openly these same
charges."
.:. That Charles Thibodeaux will be
n jlected St. Landry's sheriff on next
r Tuesday is beyond any question of
6 doubt, if you are to take w'hat is
-id by those who are familiar with
olitical conditions in this parish.
is said by those who have been
aking the parish" in the interest
f Mr. Thibodeaux's candidacy that
~e c6untry districts will give him
i tremendous majority. The peo
Ole are bent on breaking the parish
Sd city rings who are backing Mr.
Sontenot's candidacy; they intend
n next Tuesday to show the office
olders that they and not profes
filal politicians control the vote
t SLandry. Men who are old at
game-wtno have played poli
ics here for years--say that this is
he first time in the history of this
arish that every office-holder in
Landry as well as nearly every
ity official, has supported the same
-andidate for sieriff. Mr. Thibo
aux nays that the people from
!ne end of the parish to the other
indignant at this office-hold
S' and professional politicians'
mbination, and that on the 12th
September it will be torn to
ices.
i:yThat the excutive committee of
L t. Landry did Mr. Tibodeaux an
ijustice cannot. be denied. Some
&f the members of t'hat committee
e politicians, and those members
.ho are politicians pulled the wool
r the eyes of the members who
not politicians by telling them
st a long-drawn canmpaign would
rt business-at least some of the
bers of that committee cave
as an excuse for their action.
t some of those members and
tt a minority, had an interest in
campaign, Mr. Thibodeaux's
ds claim, and knowing that Mr.
Fontenot had a lead of two weeks
over Mr. Thibodeaux, tried to
crush him by calling an election at
an early date.
The city and parish oligarchies
are certainly upset. The following
is what was said by a member of
our fanious Hook Worm Club: "It
is just like watching a little child
chasing bubbles to follow the ac
tion of our politicians. Whenever
anyone from the country happens
along, the way they button-hold
him is something amusing. Where
ever you look you see office-hold
ers, office-seekers and professional
politicians running up one side of
the street and down the other in
search of votes for their candi
date, Fontenot. I do not under
stand what they mean. They surely
should have sense enough to know
that the people are not going to
stand for such a state of-affairs;
they should remember that St.
Landry is an independent parish,
and that the vbters are not going
to swallow any' candidate who is
being 'put over' by a combination
of office-holders."
Thibodeaux's circular letter and
the challenge contained 'therein
seems to have staggered the oppo
sition. They have not up to the
time of -going to press answered it
at all, neither has Mr. Fontenot ac
cepted Mr. Thibodeaux's challenge
to appear before the people of this
parish in joint-debate on Monday
night in Opelousas to explain to
them why he had failed to take the
assessment, as assessors usually
do, as is charged by Mr. Thibo
deaux.

GRAHAM--JACKSON.
Quite a charming wedding took
place on Monday, the 17th, Miss
Bessie Lula Jackson, the lovely
daughter of T. A. Jackson, Editor
of "The Enterprise," of this city,
having been united in the holy
bonds of wedlock to J. I. Graham,
of Blue Springs, Nebraska.
The wedding had a slight savor of I
romance to it: may it add an ex
tra sparkle to the champagne of
the nuptial cup: may it overflow as
bright and sparkling a promise as I
the rainbow that spanned the
heavens with its smile upon the
bridal pair upon the joy ride at
late evening after the downpour
in which the bride was surprised I
off in, the wedding having taken
place a little unexpectedly, the
groom having stolen an evening off
from .te garage, borrowing an au
tomobile from it, came in the pour
ing rain, surprising his bride elect,
eating watermelon at her bosom
friend's, and comm'anded them to
get ready for the joyful event
slightly precipitated.
It took three automobiles to get 1
the wedding party off--one getting
bogged in the front yard whence
the party started, the second
brought by the obliging and affable
"Bud" Haas, managing officiary of
the happy occasion, giving up .its
its heart pulse temporarily, run
out of business probably by the
heart beats of the bridal pair, going
into a state of syncope, lodging by
the side of the first; Mr. Haas
bringing a third car, however, the
party finally got off reaching the
desired goal the Methodist parson
age, at about six P. M., the Rev.
Harper of that church officiating.
As the Bible mentions both three
and seven as lucky numbers, and as
God spanned the heavens after the
dark period of deluge with the
rain-bow of promise, those sym
bols having predominated upon the
occasion, as it took three starts for
the party to get off,-the happy
event took place upon the 7th, and
there were seven at the marriage
rite.
After the ceremony was con
cluded, a joy ride was taken to our
sister town of Washington, and it
was indeed a JOY RIDE, as there
would have to be some champagne
sparkle where the Hon. "Budd"
Haas is.
Upon the return from the ride, a
delicious supper was enjoyed by
the party at Durio's: and that the
supper was all that could be de
sired it is needless to say, as none
would question the culinary effi
ciency of the !SUPERVISOR andi
CHEFS of that restaurant. That
the toasts BUMPED and
quaffed upon the occasion may be
fulfilled with full measure is the
sincere and ardent wish of all of
the friends of the happy pair.

ODGiES THE ISSUE
Issues Circular, But Fails to An
swer Thibodeaux's Charges
CHARLES THIBODEAUX
MAKES COUTER-CHARGES
Flays Fontenot for His Failure
to Follow the Law As As
sessor
(AN OPEN-LETTER.)
To Mr. Darius M. Fontenot:
You have issued a circular full of
spleen and bitterness, without ever
attempting to answer a single
charge which I and the newspapers
of this parish have made against
your official conduct. YOUR
ANSWER IS VIRTUALLY AN AD
MISSION OF GUILT. My circular
was couched in respectful and.
courteous language, but yours is
full of epithets and is an attempt to
SHIFT THE ISSUE. BUT YOU;
CAN'T DODGE' YOU CAN'T SHIFT;
THE PEOPLE DEMAND ANI
ANSWER AND YOU MUST Gf'VE
IT.
Am I a traducer when I state a
fact which you admit under` your
own signature?
FIRST-That you never even at:
tempted to follow the plain letter
of the law; that you never evedt
made any assessment at all for 1918.
THIS YOU ADMIT, BUT CLAIM
NO HARM WAS DONE THEREBY.
YOU CONFESS, AND THEN SEEK. i
TO AVOID!
SECOND-That you have al
ready parcelled out the sheriffs:
office between your political supr
porters and that Mr. -Charles G~B;:.
chere will be your ocief deputy,
YOU DO NOT DENY THESE
CHARGES. THEY MUST BE
TRUE, Mr. Fontenot, and you kiow
yourself you are violating the IP s;P
in so doing. YOU ARE THE.E.
FORE GUILTY AGAIN.
You hav6 asked me certain ques-.
tions., I shall be more frank an :
fair than you have been. I give
YOU AND THE. PEOPLE the' fol-.
lowing answers:
FIRST-No, I do not claim' th'.di
leadership of any faction. T am
simply an hunmble citizen asking
pl the people for support, and I
promise ALL THE PEOPLE to give
them A CLEAN, HONEST AND
COURAGEOUS administration. NO
CLIQUE OR COURT HOUSE RING
MADE ME A CANDIDATE, AND IF,
ELECTED I SHALL OWE MY RE
SPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE,
THIRD-After the election for
sheriff when Sheriff Swords de
feated me I was down and out
financially. The campaign had.
been a bitter and costly one, but
THE FIRST MAN TO TAKE MY.
HAND AND OFFER ASSISTANCE
WAS SHERTFF SWORDS. When
he did this my heart grew whrm
toward him and I swore I would
never oppose him again. He
helped me afterwards and I DTD
NOT FORGET HIS KINDNESS.
YOU DID, FOR HE MADE YOU
POLITICALLY AND AT THE.
FIRST OPPORTUNITY Y 0 U
STABBED HIM IN THE BACK PO
LITICALLY. I CLAIM FOR MY
SELF AT LEAST THE VIRTUE OF
GRATITUDE--YOU CAN NOT.
THIRD-2-Yes, with the help of
Sheriff Swords and other friends I
was appointed agent in this district
for the' conservation commission
and I HAVE TRIED TO EARN MY
SALARY-WHICH IS MORE THAN
YOU HAVE DONE AS ASSESSOR-
and I leave it to the people to say
whether I should have accepted en
appointment, which was sure to go
to someone else if I did not accept
it. WILL YOU TURNDOWN AN
APPOINTMENT AFTER YOUR
DEFEAT?
FOURTH-I was Parish Treas-°
urer for a time, many years ago,
larnd I have never heard ANYONE
SCOMPLAIN OF THE MANNER IN
- WHICH MY OFFICE WAS RUN!
- I accounted for every dollar, every
cent, that came into my hands and
- got my quitus from the Police Jury.
- Be plain, Mr. Fontenot, if you can't
