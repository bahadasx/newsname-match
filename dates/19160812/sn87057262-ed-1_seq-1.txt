^'HIOAGO, Aug. 12.—An estimated
loss of $100,000,000 In Russian trade
to American firms within'' the '«»t
eight months through the delay of
cables by the British censors, was
charged today by A. a Postnikoff.
president of the International Manu
facturers Sales Co. Postnikoff sub
stantlated United Press dispatches
from Petrograd stating that efforts
are being made to lay a direct cable
between Russia and America. He de
clared this was. being done because of
the. Inability to get proper cable trans
mission of Russian orders through
the British censor. He charged that
Great Brltalil has been actually
stealing American trade, with the
declaration that out of fifty caBles re
ceived by his company in the last
eight months, only five have been
transmitted in their original form,
"While I have no direct proof that
Great Britain has garbled our cables
to throw trade to their own manufac
turers, I am pretty certain that suph
is the case," said Postnikoff.
"In the past eight months, eight
cables from here to our Petrograd
office and from that office to this of
fice, seven, Wen Mftfc—
"No doubt exists In my mind that
Great Britain Is using every possible
means, flair or foul, to Interfere and
if possible put an end to direct trade
relations between the United States
and other countries. Great Britain is
particularly desirous of discouraging
such trade between American firms
and their (Russian customers.
"Prior to the war, Germany en
joyed this lucrative position in all our
dealings with Russia."
The International Manufactures
Sales company is a subsidiary sales
organization of fifty American firms,
representing a total capital of f400,
000,000.
Postnikoff said his concerns pro
tested to Washington regarding the
censorship of their cables and that
considerable correspondence with the
state department followed. Nine
cables from the company's Russian
offices are still missing, Postnikoff de
cl&rod*
"The loss to America as a result of
the British thefts will run over |100,
000,000," he said.
He declared that absolute proof of
the theft by British censor has been
laid before the state department toy a
large American corporation. This
corporation, he said, is located in
Pittsburgh.
Postnikoff considers the situation
so serious that he plans to leave for
New York tonight to confer with
Newcomb Carleton, head of the West
ern Union Telegraph company, re
garding the laying of cables between
Russia and this country.

LONDON, Aug. 12.—Tba advance
guard of the Russian force that occu
pied Stanislau, pressed* on two miles
northeast of'the city and crossed the
river Zlota Bistritza, eighteen miles
south of Halitz, according to Petro
grad dispatches today.
The Austro-Germans offered but
weak resistance and then continued
their retreat north. Several guns
were abandoned by the enemy in
their retreat from the Zloca Bistritza.
Two separate Russian forces are
now converging on Halite, the imme
diate objective of General Letchltsky
in his drive against Lemberg. The
first, moving eastward along the north
bank, of the Dniester, is less than
twenty miles from Halitz. The sec
ond force, operating soulh of the
Dniester, is composed of the detach
ments that took Stanislau.
There is no indication in dispatches
from either Petrograd, Berlin or
Vienna that the Russian advance, the
most rapid made by any army since
the Austro-Germans Balkan campaign
has been even slowed up. In four
days the Slavs have progressed
twenty miles and in the fighting about
Stanislau alone they have taken
nearly twenty villages and towns.
Battling over much more difllcult
country, the Italians havo scored suc
cess of equal importance in their
southward swing toward Trieste. The
news from both Petrograd and Rome
suggests that the demoralization of
the Austrian armies may be more
complete than earlier advices indi
cated.
No official statement has been made
public here thus far, of activities in
the Balkans reported from Paris yes

a woman waiting. A bird chirped on
the window sill.
"So this is day mused the wom

"Yes," repeated the nurse. "This
is day and that is a bird and those
are flowers."
The woman was Mrs. Mary OTjJir

first time. She had been blind for
elxty-two years". Dr. Aaron Green,
formerly of Denver, had "performed
the operation that ibrought light out
of darkness. All night long the
woman waited restlessly for the day
so that she might enjoy the things
she had visualized in her years of
darkness.
"And what is the most beautiful
thing you hope to spe?" inquired the
nurse.
"I havo already seen It," was the
reply. "It was my boy—my great
big boy whom I never saw until last
night. My only regret is that I never
saw my husband, that he died before
my vision was restored."

She does not know him. At his

DETERMINED TO
NOLO POSITIONS
Railway Employes Farther
Than Ever From Settle,
ment of Dispute With
Managers.
REFUSAL TO ARBITRATE
Judge Knapp Announces That Media
tion Haa Failed and the
Situation la Very
Critical.
NEW YORK, '.fug. 12.—The 400,000
railroad employes seemed farther
away than ever from peaceful set
tlement of their differences with the
railway managers today as the em
ployes' representatives went into ses
sion with the federal mediation and
conciliation board.
Opposing leaders seemed more de
termined to hold to their widely
divergent positions.
"It now is a question of whether
the big brotherhoods will arbitrate,"
said one official who is acting with
the railroad managers. "Yon cari
state that the railroad managers twill
not recede from their demands for
settlement by arbitration. Under no
circumstances will this stand be de
viated from."
"We will never consent to abrltra
tion," was the unanimous expression
from every member of the executive
board of the brotherhoods. "Carta
aire too easily stacked la arbitration.
We have conceded all we can by
agreeing to mediation from the fed
eral hoard." One railroad official. In
emphasizing the determination of
managers to Insist on arbitration/
said:
-"The impression seems to have
gone forth that the railroads will re
cede from their position when a strike
is called and grant the demands of
the men in order to avert a walkxmt.
You can state and most emphatical
ly, that this is not true. If the men
continue in their refusal to arbitrate,
this country will see one of the great
est strikes in its history."
Mediation Falls.
(NEW YORK, Aug. 12.—Mediation
has failed in the controversy between
400,000 railroad employes and the
managers of the 225 railroads 'affect
ed. This was the formal announce
ment made today by Judge Martin
Knapp of the United States board of
mediation and conciliation, in a com
munication to the trainmen.
Judge Knapp'p communication read:
"In our judgment after two days of
consideration of the difficulties be
tween the railway managers and the
employes, there is no prospect of set
tlement by mediation and therefore
w© suggest arbitration as the means
of reaching a settlement.
Immediately they were handed
Judge Knapp's communication, the
executive board of the brotherhoods,
who have beeh empowered by a ninety
four per cent vote to call a strike, if
in their opinion such action is essen
tial to success of their fight for an
eight hour day and time and a half for
overtime, went into executive session
to consider the suggestion.
From a statement a short time be
fore, the bcarfl declared unanimously
and unequivocally that they would
never consent to arbitration.
Admitted failure of mediation It was
said in railroad and brotherhood cir
cles, developed the most ominous sit
uation since the trainmen made their
demands on the railroads.
This seriousness was emphasized
by the statement of a prominent re
tired railroad president that the rail
roads would face a strike rather than

[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
HELENA, Mont, Aug. 12j—Gover
nor Hughes expects to try a new
campaigning stunt this afternoon. He
Joyfully accepted an invitation to de
scend 2,800 feet into the depths of
Leonard copper mine at Butte. Mrs.
Hughes, who ha3n't quitted her hus
band's side through the other hard
ships of the transcontinental trip
which her husband Is making to win
votes for the presidency, wanted to
go, but It was decided she had better
not.
John H. Mcintosh of Butte, who
Joined the republican nominee's party
here today, made the announcement
of the governor's underground search
for votes. He told the governor thfi"
trip might prove of Interest, but he
wanted to warn him in advance that
mines weren't the safest things in
the world and that he did not have
to accept the invitation.
"You can bet I want to go," the
governor responded quickly. "There
are lots of men who work
in
li
i\
mines
every day and I'm not in the least
afraid any way."
The Leonard mine Is not the big
gest of Butte's under earth industries,
but the committee held It to be bet
ter adapted for sightseeing. The gov
ernor will be furnished with Jumpers
and overalls.
Governor Hughes today reached
that point in his assault on the demo
cratic trenches at which an Euro
pean army commander would report
himself ready for the concerted at
tack at a particular point. The re«
publican candldatae feels he has done
the preparatory work In the twenty*
four campaign speeches he has made
since leaving New York one week ago
today. He has Indicated that his
main reliance in assault Is the weapon
of criticism of democracy's alleged
inefficiency. From now on, the gov
ernor proposes to back up this gen
eral charge with concerted, fire. Ha
is armed with specific Instances
which the republicans claim will sup
port the general allegation. In his
speeches hereafter, he win use thi»
data to back up his preparatory as
sault.
In the one week's campaigning to
date, it appears that the repiihliean
main assault will he against demo
cratic Inefficiency, and Included
this inefficiency criticism will be tho
Mexican policy the foreign policy
the "pork barrel" policy the pre
paredness policy the tariff policy and
the administration policy.
The phrase which has so far evoked
the most applause from thn nominee
auditors has been: "I'd like to have
a chance to investigate the democra
tic administration and today when

"Behind the projected revolution,"
stated the government official, "are
a number of Mexicans owning mil

living in Los Angeles, San Antonio

safety of their wealth depends upon
the crumbling of the Carranza regime.
They are going about their revolu

"Some of the Carranza garrisons
are undermined now, I believe," de
clared the official. "Colonel 'Mariano

bought, but loyal Carranzistas dis
covered his plans and forced him to
