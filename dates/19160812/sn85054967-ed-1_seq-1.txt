LONDON, Aug. 9.—The cap

on the Isonzo River front by the
Italians was followed today by
the taking of the Gorizia for
tress 'and the town of the same
name from the Austrians. In the
operation the Italians captured

booty.
The victory of the Italians,

steady forward drive of the
French and British on the Som

Russians upon Lemberg, capital
of Galicia, but it is also, of

Gorizia is only 22 miles north
west of the Austrian port of

are few defenses between Gor

And southeast off Trieste is the

PAPER CAN BE MADE
FROM COTTON STALKS
BERLIN, Aug. 11.—(Cor
respondent of the Associated
Press) — The Royal material
testing office at Gross-Liether
velde a suburb of Berlin, an
nounced the discovery that pa
per can be manufactured from
cotton stalks.
The discovery is not consid
ered of much importance for
Germany, which produces no
cotton, but is pointed to as of
vast importance to the United
States, the greatest producer of
cotton in the world, because of
the shortage of paper reported
in that country.
The stalks are cut and ground,
boiled and bleached, and the pa
per making then proceeds after
the usual methods.

Whenever you go to Buchheit

furniture dealers, and are wait
ed on by a short, statureu man,
with spectaccles, that is Mr. x#.
A. Cost; do not think that his
capacity is only that of a clerk*
because if you do, you are mi&-
taken.
Mr. Cpst does not brag about
his work with anybody, but on.
the contrary he is very quiet:
about it and unless you really
want to know something about
it, you are standing a fine chance
to be talked to on the subject.
As to his work we are told!
that two of Mr. Costs's oil paint
ings are on exhibition in the
Carnegie Art Gallery, Pitta
burgh, one of which is Pharos.
Horses and the other Black and!
White Beauty.
In Mr. Cost's home are many
examples of his work worthy of
comment.
Some of the finest homes of
this place have paintings by Mr.
Cost. Some of his water color
and crayon work among- /
the best in the state. He has
sold some of his pictures
throughough the state and espe
cially in Pittsburgh, Harrisburfir
and Washington, D . C. , and the
owners are proud of their po&*
sessions.
