RAILROAD CASE
IS A FAILURE
Unofficially Reported That
Men Will Appeal to
President Wilson.
NATION-WIDE STRIKE
SEEMS IMMINENT
Board Proposed New Form
of Mediation—Brother
hoods Consider It.
WILSON TAKES HAND.
Washington, Aug. 12.—Wilson
notified die railroad strike media
tors that he would tike to consult
representatives of both sides before
a final break.
The president was in communi
cation by telephone with the fed
eral mediators, asking that he be
informed if a strike became im
minent.
The president told the mediators
ttiat the strike must be averted and
that if a deadlock ia reached he
would like the opportunity to talk
with the representatives of railroad
managers and employes.
Up to 2 p. m. the president had
not received word that the situa
tion was hopeless-
No decision was reached by the
representatives of the Brother
hoods of railway employes. They
will give their answer to the medi
ation board tomorrow.
New York, Aug. 12.—The final ef
fort of the United States board of
mediation and conciliation to settle
the differences between the railroads
and their 400,000 employes through
mediation has failed, but the media
tors today proposed to the brother
hoods a new form of arbitration,
whleh the brotherhood chiefs and
delegates almost immediately began
considering in executive session- Up
on the decision of the employes as to
the acceptability of this form of ar
bitration depends the question of call
ing a nation-wide railroad strike. If
the proposal is refused, the only
chance of preventing a strike lies In
an appeal to the president to en
deavor to bring the disputants to
gether.
A delegate, emerging from the
meeting which still was in session this
Afternoon, said Unofficially that the
men had voted to reject the proposal
for arbitration and to lay the case be
fore-the .president.

Bart Younlcln of Bnderlln, N. D.,

ed under his direction nis confederates
say.
The four men arrested here were

WOODEN-SOLED SHOE
THAT IS FLEXIBLE
Budapest, Hungary, .Aug. 12.—Bar
na S. Kohlened, an Hungarian cap
tain of cavalry whose military use
fulness was ended when he lost an
arm, has devoted himself since his
Incapacitation to inventing' a wooden
soled shoe that shall have the virtue
of flexibility, and announces that he
has solved this problem, the hardest
that has confronted wooden-soled shoe
enthusiasts.
His invention Is a sole that, Instead
of being made of one solid piece of
wood, Is constructed of a number of
layers Joined together by heavy oils
or fats that thicken and grip the
fess
ileces of wood together. After count
experiments Capt. Kohlener de
clares that wooden soles constructed
in this manner have the elasticity of
leather soles, and in, addition can be
made of old and worn material work
ed over.
Berlin Food Kitchens
Get Fewer Patrons
Berlin, Aug. 12.—A good index to
the improving food conditions In Ger
man cities Is afforded by the practical
working out of experimental munici
pal mass feeding in Greater Berlin
during the first month's existence of
the municipal kitchens.
The Initial registration was disap
pointing to the authorities, who had
made lavish arrangements and had
equipped plants for feeding hundreds
Of thousands of persons if necessary.
The number of registrations increased
slightly during the first two weeks,
tut now has shrunk to one-half the
original number, which, In view of
the. fact that the municipal food is
offered At and below cost, Indicates
that at present there Is neither wide
spread need nor demand for munici
pal food,' and that Berllners are Able
and prefer to cover their own food
requirements and cook at home.
This has been a revelation to those
who bad Judged Germany's food
problem too conservatively.
WOTTAH^H THROAT
SLASHED, ^1NTS|
ASSAILANT'S SUICIDE
Chicago, Aug. 12.—Although he
cut her throat a moment before,
Mrs. Emma Bender today prevented
Christian Wolf from ending his own
life by tearing first an opened razor
and then a bottle of poison from
his hand. Mrs. Bender, a widow, is
hi a serious condition at a local
hospital. Wolf, who has been pay
ing attention to the woman, wrote
several notes saying that he in
tended killing himself because she
misspent money he gave her.
"BULLET PROTECTOR"
IS VERY DANGEROUS
Vienna, Aug 12.—The Austrian au
thorities have been making an appar
ently ineffectual fight against an al
leged "bullet protector'' that is wide
ly sold, but which it is claimed is
dangerous rather than helpful in any
way.
The "protector" Is nothing but a
curved piece of metal that is hung
about the neck inside the tunic, and
which, its producers claim, will stop
or lessen the force of a bullet fired
at long range. In practice, the au
thorities claim, it is merely a menace
because a bullet at short range—as
most of them are—will not only pierce
it easily but flatten out in the process
and often carry bits of the metal on
into the body.
Some half a dozen dealers in the
"protector" were haled before the
court's recently on the charge of en
dangering public safety. Each claim
ed that the metal shields will stop
bullets fired at a thousand yards or
more. They established satisfactor
ily that they never had sold the
shields under any other pretense, and
therefore could not be held for fraud-
GREAT BRITAIN
TO MAKE LOAN
Reported that England Will

GREAT BRITAIN—2 tel
New York. Aug. 12—Expectation is
expressed in financial circles today
that within a fortnight an official an
nouncement will be made that regotia
tions have been completed for a new
loan, reported to be $250,000,000, to
Great Britain. The American Foreign
securities company would carry the
obligation. The loan would run for
two years, with Interest at 6 per cent,
it is reported.
LONDON BOARD TO
END HORST COMPANY
London, Aug. 12.—The board of
trade has decided to wind up the af
fairs of the Horst company on the
ground that it is an enemy concern.
D. J. Partelio of Chicago, who was
said by officials of the company to be
in oontrol of the concern, appeared
before the board and said the control
lay in the hands of American and
British stockholders. It is understood
other companies in which Mr. Par
telio Is concerned will meet a similar
fate.
Before the war the Horst company
was under control of Mr. Partello's
brother-in-law, Baron Lewis von
Horst of Coburg, Germany, who was
arrested soon after the war began as
an alien enemy and interned. The
American consulate has been asked to
intervene on the ground that the
companies affected are now controll
ed by American capital.
The board of trade began proceed
ings in June against the Hop Extract
company and the Horst company, in
the organization of which Baron von
Horst, who formerly lived in Cali
fornia, was concerned.

Informal Inquiries into
les
the Bread Situation
Washington, Aug. 12.—Whether
there shall be a federal Investigation
of the high cost of flour and prospec
tive Increases In bread prices depends
largely on the report of Commissioner
Hurley, now In Chicago making Infor
mal inquiries for the federal trade
commission.
Mr. Hurley went to Chicago partic
ularly to seek definite Information at
the headquarters of the National Bak
ers' association concerning statements
during the association's convention at
Salt Lake City that the price of bread
soon would be increased. Officials of
the commission said today, however,
that they would look into the general
question of flour and bread prices.
The departments of agriculture and
Justice also are giving attention to the
subject, although there has been no
formal action.
Copies of a resolution passed by the
bakers at Salt Lake City calling on
congress to place-an embargo on flour

President Marshalland Speaker Clark.

NORTH DAKOTA'S
MAKE
BK SUCCESSB
WJHE EAST
Sweeping Victories are Re
ported—Stanislau is
Captured.
London, Aug. 12.—A further series
of surprising successes by the armies
of Generals Sakharoff and Letchitzky
were announced by the Russians. The
most important of these successes
were the capture of the important
railway Junction and town of Stanis
lau the definite occupation of Mon
aaterzyska and the seizure of im
portant positions on the Zlota Lipa
line. Coupled with these victories was
the capture of many thousands of
prisoners, especially on the right bank
of the Sereth, where the prisoners
taken number five thousand.
The Germans appeared to regard
the Kovel-Lemberg sector as the
most critical position on the eastern
front, and the appointment of Field
Marshal von Hindenburg to the chief
command undoubtedly had the effect!
of temporarily stemming the Russian
advance on the northern section of
the line. But Field Marshal von Hin
denburg does not hold the controlling
command over the troops guarding
the southern approaches to Lemberg.
where General Letchitzky, having
taken Stanislau and being in striking
distance of Halich, is rapidly com
pleting his encirclement of the army
of General von Bothmer. The lat
ter's forces have held obstinately to
their positions since last winter, and I
have kept them virtually intact. How
ever, it cannot- be long now before
the fate of Lemberg is sealed, mili
tary observers believe.
The possession of Stanislau and
Kolomea makes secure the Russian
possession of B.ukowina and gives
them a base for an invasion of Hun
gary. The fall of Halich, which also
is regarded as Imminent, would inter
fere seriously with General von Both
mer's communications, and would
compel him to retire his army along
the left bank of the Dniester toward
.Lemberg and between the Russian
forces advancing from the direction
of TarnopOl and Brody. The German
official statement today admitted a re
grouping of the Teutonic forces was
taking place in order to meet the new
positions of the Russian armies.

Johnstown, Pa-, Aug. 12.—Ten to

injured at Echo, ten miles from here,
in a street car wreck today. The in
jured were brought here.
The accident occurred on the South
ern Cambria Electric railroad, which
connects Johnstown with Ebensburg,
the county seat, at the foot of a steep
hill. One car had just turned a sharp
curve when it was telescoped by an

CUYUNA STRIKE
BECOMES GRAVER
Crosby, Minn-, Aug. 12.—The strike
situation on the Cuyuna range is be
coming graver. Shots were fired yes
terday. While a few miners return
ing from work were coming through
the additions of Crosby adjoining
Ironton they were stopped and badly
beaten, having already received
threats of such treatment if they in
sisted on going to work.
Deputy sheriffs stationed along the
roads leading to the mines soon came
to the rescue, and a lively exchange
of shots resulted. The deputies, be
ing inferior in number, were forced
to run. Other deputies were soon on
the scene with the local police, and a
half dozen arrests were made, a
couple of the ringleading agitators
being among them. As far as can be
learned no one was injured during
the shooting.
Another shooting affray is reported
between here and Cuyuna, but no
harm was done.
A meeting of ths business men of
Crosby and Ironton was held at Iron
ton to discuss what steps could best
be taken to settle the trouble. Yes
terday afternoon the village councils
of Crosby and Ironton passed ordi
nances forbidding the parading of
masses through the streets of either
town without a permit from the
council. Most of the mines are still
open and trying to work.
DEMOCRATS RECONSIDER
INCOME TAX REDUCTION
Washington. Aug. 12.—yielding to
a flood of protests from the country
and from senate and house members
of their own party. Democrats of the
senate finance committee reconsider
ed yesterday their decision to lower
the exemption in the income tax law
from $4,000 to $3,000 for married and
single persons to $3,000 and $2,000
respectively, but voted to make the
rate of tax on the lowest taxable
class of income two per cent instead
of one per cent.
Had the committee declined to
yield on the amendment, the Demo
cratic senate caucus probably would
have reversed it. The amendment in
creasing the surtax on incomes ex-'
ceeding $2,000,000 from 10 to 13 per
cent is retained, and it is probable
further surtax increases will be made
in caucus.
Last night the Democratic caucus
continued consideration of commit
tee amendments and had before it the
proposal agreed on
1
by
the committee
late in the day striking out the speci
fic excise taxes on munitions manu
factures and substituting a 10 per
cent net profit tax on the profits of
all manufacturers of munitions and
wares that enter into munitions.
The committee also adopted an
amendment today increasing the sal
aries of members of the proposed tar
iff board from $7,500 to $10,000 each.
As revised by the committee the
bill would yield an estimated annual
t-evenue of $198,000,000 as against
$210,000,000 as it passed the house.
The net decrease is due to the change
in the munitions tax. the house meas
ure providing for $72,000,000 and the
senate plan $45,000,000.

AMERICAN DEMAND
FOR WOOL GREAT
Sydney, Australia, Aug. 12—The
American demand was probably the
most conspicuous feature of the sta
