SENATOR
JAMES
H there Is one man in Missouri who
can, feel proud of his renomlnatlon It
should be Senator James A. Reed, who
is now so ably representing with Mis
souri's great senator, William Joel
Stone, this great state In the national
senate.
Senator Reed had but one oppon
ent, Judge L. A. Martin of Chllllcothe
who, by the way, Is one of the great
lawyers of Missouri and a most es
timable gentleman and the latter
made a most active and vigorous cam
paign, visiting all of the big counties
and cities of the state and by his
pleasing personality securing many
votes, but to no avail, for when the
final result was disclosed ft was found
that Senator Reed had so much ma
jority to his credit that It was hardly
necessary to give the total.
The Prime Reason
The pilme reason why Senator Reed
was renominated by such a splendid
majority is that he has made good
he has represented the people of Mis
souri and he has been at his post at all
times and at all hours fighting for
them and for their interests. He, like
Congressman Booher, believes that
when a man Is given a public office
his place is where the, people send
him and not at some other point where
ho might Incidentally help his own
personal cause to the neglect of the
people In whose employ he Is.
Reed Will Fight
The people of Missouri like Reed
they like him because he Is a fighter
and fights for their Interest. They
like him also from the fact that when
CLARK THERE 33 YEARS
And No Missourian Will Say "He
Has Been There Long Enough;
We Want a Change"
Washington, Aug. 7. Republl-
can Leader Mann reminded the
'V House today that Speaker Clark
had Just passed his thirty-third
anniversary as a member of
Congress, And Republicans and
Democrats rose and cheered the
speaker for several minutes. Re-
sponding, Mr, Clark said he was
not sure he wanted to remain In
the House another thirty-three
years, but did know he wanted 4
to stay as lpng as be could.
THE FIGHTING
SEN. J. A.
REED
he says something the other senators
and the people sit up and take notice.
Just as an example of how he fights,
when on July 21 the Bethlehem Steel
company, througlr Its hireling. Sena
tor Penrose of the steel trust noxious
fame, had carried through the senate
a resolution which would allow the
Bethlehem Steel company to print In
the Congressional Record Its offer to
the government to furnish armor plate
at a lower price than It had prev iousl
robbed the government of. Senator
Reed, who was absent when the
shameless piocedure was rushed
through, came Into the senate cham
ber and, discovering what had tran
spired, delivered a speech which com
pletely upset the robbeis' program
and which he concluded thiway:
A Twenty.Nine Year Steal
"For twenty-nine ears, according to
Its own admission, the Bethlehem
Steel company has robbed the govern
ment whose flag floats over It and
whose armies and navies protect it by
charging exorbitant prices for the
armor plate It manufactured. Now,
when the government proposes to
build a plant of Its own, to prevent
this holdup, the Bethlehem Steel com
pany, through Its stockholders in the
senate, asks unanimous consent to
have Its misleading propaganda and
advertisements made a senate docu
ment, that It may be printed bj the
government and circulated through
.the mails free, and that It may be sent
throughout the country with this
. brand of government sanction. It Is a
shameless proposition."
WILL FIGHT WILSON
Because Of His Unchanged Attitude
On Women Suffrage "He Must
Go"
Colorado Springs, Col., Aug. 7. The
announcement from the White House
that President Wilson's attitude to
ward the Susan B. Anthony amend
ment was unchanged was regaided at
the headquarters of the National Wo
man's party ns hostile to the move
ment. "The women of the United States
cannot allow a man who has taken
such a stand to return to the White
House for another four yeais," said
Miss Mabel Vernon, secretary of the
Natlpnal Woman's party. "There Is
no other course for the National Wo
an'g party to pursue. We must fight
for our rights." -

Primary
"I moat certainly appreciate the
lonl and substantia! support accord
ed me by my friends of the Fourth
district during the late primary,"
v. riles Congressman Charles K.
Booher from his post In Washington.
"Their generous support Is an Indi
cation that they recognize that when
they select a man for public service
he Is their servant and should attend
to the duties for which they selected
him, no matter what the exigency, or
how badly he recognized that he
should look after his personal Inter
ests and preferment. The people of
the Fourth district have shown by
their ballots that they have faith in
my desire to serve their best Inter
ests, and I can but express In merj
words the appreciation which I feel
of their generous support and their
substantial , encouragement of my
course."
JONES PLAYING POLITICS
Instead Of Fighting The Demon Rum
He Is Trying To Turn Missouri
Over To The Republicans
Editor Bate C. Drum mo nil of the
Lexington News, Is one of the good
advocates who sees through the
scheme of the Antl-Sa'oon League to
turn Missouri over to the Republicans.
The News put up a strong fight to put
the saloons out of business In Lexing
ton, but could not overcome the handi
cap of Jones & Co. This Is the opin
ion of the News regarding Jones.
"Just recently Jones of the Anti-Sa
loon League conducted a local optlou
election in Lexington. It develops
now that Jones put in more time pla.
Ing politics than he did trying to make
Lexington dry. Fred 1). Gardner,
candidate for governor was his special
target. We are confident not many
people will fall for anj thing that Jones
says. It is quite apparent to everyone
now that the Jones methods lost the
dry cause a lot of votes in the recent
electtcva. and several weeks close oil
tjratlonof Jones In action will en
able the diy Democrats of this section
to put correct estimate on ever thing
that Jones says or does. Jones, Shupp
and the Anti-Saloon League organiza
tion in Missouri are wearing the livery
of Heaven to successfully seive the
devil."
TO ELIMINATE FACTIONS
The Congressional Committee Meeting
Witt Be One of Especial
Interest.
The Democratic congressional com
nilttee will meet at the Mouroe Club
rooms next Tuesday for the purpose
of selecting a chairman and secre
tary of the committee and two mem
bers of the state committee. The
meeting will be a most Important one,
as the two men to be selected as
members of the state committee will
be a party to formulating the stato
platform and, will also have much to
do with the conduct of the state and
national campaign.
Whom the committee will select is
with the exception or Hon. I. R. Wil
liams, who Is now the chairman, prob
lematlc, but one thing Is certain and
that is that neither of the factions
that now war with each other in St
Joseph will be In the saddle. It Is al
ready illfinltely settled that I. R. Wil
Hums, who, on account of his connec
tlon w 1th Congressman Booher, w ho 1
renominated, will again bo the, chair
man, as It Is his duty to look after th
Democratic nominee; of this district.
The conseusus of opinion as reached
from the expressions of the various
chairmen of the county committees
selected Is that no St. Joseph man Is
desired or will bo given preference In
tho selection of the state committee,
for if such should be the case fac
tionalism would enter Into the matter,
which would have much bearing on
the November election, therefore St
Joseph candidates will be eliminated
and the outside counties will be rec
ognized. GREAT TENT MEETINGS
Democratic State Committee Getting
Ready For Big Rallies All over
The State
The state committee is working out
a plan to hold a series of great tent
meetings In all parts of the state.
It Is proposed to secure at least four
tents, each with a seating capacity of
from three to four thousand. These

States With Exhorters and Whip-

Michigan this jear gives every
promise of being a genuine fighting
ground for Democracy. Reports from
the different ltlcs aie fast accctimula
ting to prove this.
The presence of Woodrow Wilson at
Detroit, the Insurrection of the Pro
gressives against the Perkins-Roosevelt
delivery, and the great piosperity
ever where throughout Michigan are
leaning- 'strongly in favor of Demo-
cracy.
Mechanics who were getting two
and three dollars three years ago are
now receiving from four to six dallars,
and the are content with piesent con
dition The mobilization of the troops to
wards the Mexican border has sent a
message home that no other single act
could to Impress the people of Michi
gan with the full benefit to the Nation
of the Woodrow Wilson peace polic
It looks very clearly from all of
these reasons as if Michigan with its
former "u.OOo Republican pluralit
would be converted into a good work
ing pluralit for Demooacv and Wood
row Wllsou.
A 'Joe observer of the conditions
In'ObTo is even more emphatic In the
declaration that Ohio will be a posi
tive asset to the Woodrow Wilson
election this jear. Some of the most
conservative buslnesri men of Cleve
land. Toledo, and otbei Important
f-ltles are making the open declaration
ih.it Ohio will be Demociatlc this ear.
The appointment of the secretary of
war and the recent appointment of
the supreme court Justice, both of
whom are held in high esteem by the
people of Ohio, will give an added in
centive for the Ohioans to Join the
ranks of the new Democracy of Wood
row Wilson.
Ohio Democrats Active

there may be some question about
Ohio electing Its Democratic Senator
this year, the personally of the Presi
dent and the piosperity or Ohio, all
point very strongl towards Woodrow
Wilson's success in Ohio.
The Golden State.too, has all the
eai marks of being added to the Demo
i rime ranks. On account of the gieat
disaffection caused b the Piogiesive
convention, California Is solely nettled
to a degree that it has never been in
re. eat ears. Mcst of the leading Pro
gressives, including evgoveruor Hiram
Jurnson, and a great number of other
IU (5uns have suited boomlnB for
Wilson and an one acquainted with
the m can readll understand that their
liocm. once stalled, will not be husned

Angeles, Is Jubilant over the outlook
for Wilson. Through northern ( all
fornla. In Keene and Kern counties
ai d into Frisco Itself there Is a pet
v tiding spirit that Wilson will win in

Massachusetts, the old Bay State,
the home of Cnbot Lodge and former
S nator Murray Crane, is also teeming
ovr with disaffection towards the
standpatters.
Matthew Hale, one of the most con
spicuous of the Progressives, has

both of the other parties to put forth
their best Idealism and aspirations
Many of those men bellued In Theo

them out of the wilderness. Their
disappointment Is keen.
Some Figures From Maine
An announcement made by William
R. Pattangall, Demorcratlc campaign
manager in Maine, respecting the pro
bable division of the Progressive vote
In that state during the coining elec
tion, abounds In sound reasoning
which will carry satisfaction to all
Democrats.
It Is the first responsible declaration !
by an active polltlcial leader In "he ho
campaign which has been started In
that hitherto pivotal state. Mr. Put-
tangall's statement will ca -ry little
comfort to the Republicans at home
or abroad. They had fondly hoped to
falrl snatch Maine from the Demo-1
crats while they were not looking audi
run away with It.
Mr. Pattangall's estimate Is that one
half of the men who voted for Gaidnerl
two ears ago, and there were 18 000
of them, will align themselves with
the Democratic part this year It
will not be necessarv' for the- Demo-
crats to share equally with the Kepub-
Ucans in a division of the Ptogresslve
vote to carr the st,u. this jear.
Figuring on the basis nf the 1914
campaign, considerably icss than one considerations It hits the right side

a Dissection and Dislocation of the

Utterances.
The St. Joseph News-Press Is a
great newspaper of this there is no
question for It Is conducted on modern
lines and by men who know how to
run a real newspaper, therefore It not
only has a circulation but It also has
deserved prestige. The only fault
that can be found with it is that often
it wanfs things entirely its own way

"The European war confronted Mr
Wilson with unprecedented conditions
and it was his task to maintain the
neutrality of this nation and Its Integ

gives assurance that "this nation has.
no policy of aggression toward Mex

Wilson's policy has not been aggres

Mr Hughes is confident that the

Ints would not have been destroyed
had Mr Wilson made stionger repre

Mr Hughes have made his representa

and thus taken the chance of loung

Mr Hughes denounces all plots

gone farther In such denunciation than
Mr Wilson? Besides, hasn't Mr. Wil
son successfully put a stop to these
depredations and landed a number of
the plotters In Jail?
Mr. Hughes deplores the fact that
this country Is shockingly unprepared.
True, .but who has been stronger than
