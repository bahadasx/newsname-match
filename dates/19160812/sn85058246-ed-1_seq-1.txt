I WHO ISGUILTY ?
I Mr. Editor:
H The article In the Tuesday's Issue
H of your paper under the heading,
H Slaughter of the Innocent Is very apt
H to cause general alarm to those hav
H ing no other Information than
H can be gained from reading tho ar
H ttcle. Really there is no cause for'
S such calamity howling. Tho trees
H are not being removed, except at the
H rcfucst of property owners and t;ie
fl rest are being cut back to a height
l of 30 feet and properly pruned and
y in tho mnjority of cases Improved by
the operation.
The author of the aforesaid article
Is to be highly commended for her
civic spirit and her lovo and respect
for our trees, but she is evidently not
nwaro that tho pioneers, who planted
these same trees wero not thtnkmg
of the time In the far distant futute
when cement sidewalks, streets, tel
ephone and llglit and power lines etc.
I would bo used. Their chief object
iJ was to provide shade and inciter an
I soon as possible and they therefore
I planted such quick growing trees as
i wro available, at the time and to
N W doubly sure of the results, plant
H k. them close together. Hence the
1 Necessity now for "Slaughtering tliem
I as it is termed.
I All of this work could have been
I . avoided if tho pioneers and succeed
I ing generations had taken a little In
1 I terest in the trees and gave them an
I I annual pruning and kept thorn at a
B I reasonable size. Now there Is no bet-
I ter remedy than the treatment which
f they are receiving.
II In regard to tho trees injuring tho
If pavement. I beg to remind tho nuth
1 or of tho fact, that Utah Is an arid
stato, whero irrigation has been the
1 liractlco from tho beginning nnd
8 wherever trees have been planted,
J thoy have had watet; nnd plenty of It
I which has caused a shallow rooted
I tree. In other words tho trees roots
I fiavo not had to go down deep Into
Jj tho ground for moisture, but have do-1
veloped near tho surface wliero tho
water was nt their disposal. Tho
rocking of tho trees by tho wind
eausos tho surfaro roots ot tho trees
to upheavo, cracking tho pavement.
Only last week a section of paved
walk on First Wost street hnd to bo
token out and the roots of tho adjac
ent tree removed and tho cement put
back in tlio placo.
While wo aro all loath to part with
Bour live long friends and benefactors
Wlio poplar, box older, etc., In tho
tf.Pnarch of progress, thoy also must
Kivo placo to moro modern nnd econ
omic species of the hardwood typo,

that are particularly adapted to sido
walk planting. With proper caro thoy
W'lll mako excellent trees In from H
to 10 years and with a, littlo annual
pruning it will rarely If ovor, be nec
essary to top them.
It is n regrettable fuet that w-e
do not approclato tho valuo and the
beauty of trees for tho reason that
II tho vnrlotles most common hero grow
so rank and becomo so shnggy that
pruning them propoily lit nltnost an
Impossibility, therefore topping thorn

Is resorted to, causing endless trouble.
Logan should have a law regulating
the planting of trees on public streets
and employ a competent man to see
that they are properly cared for and
gradually replace tho overgrown rap
Id growing varieties with hardwoods
using different varieties If possible,
on each street. But the Idea of inter
planting 'With hard woods as suggest
ed in the article, is out of the ques
tion from the fact that tho moro rapid
growing tree would continue to ap
propriate the moisture nnd soil fer
tility and starvation for the hara
wood sapling would bo tho result.
Trees are' 'not planted Solely for "the
shade ,but for their ornamentnl ef
fect and should be given sufUclent
room to develop naturally thus add
ing to their beauty.
When planted for shade they shouta
be placed where shade Is most need
ed during the hottest part of the day
which by tho way, Is not on the north
side of the house or yet on the east
but on tho south and west. It Is well
to remember that plenty of sunshine
nnd free circulation of air aro very
Important factors In modern sanita
tion and while trees provide shade
from the sun, they should by no
means be permitted to excludo all
of the sun.
I wish to emphasize tho fact that
all this huo and cry about tree slaugh
tering Is actuated from sentiment
and not from a knowledge ot tho
facts. As I said before the work is
being done with care and trees that
are cut back now will mako a now
top that will provide, ample shado by
tho time hot weather comes next sea
son. This I know for a fact, Jiaving
topped trees on Thursday which wero
cut back to poles In tho spring of
1915.
To ono with a sense of humor it
Is nmuslng to hear a corporation law
yer speak of soulless corporations or
maiden sc.iool teachers talking of
lovers loitering under the troes
(That Is decidedly out of date, thoy
accomplish the same results going
Joy riding or to tho movies) and the

MRS. SEAMONS
PASSES AWAY
SUDDENLY
Hyde Park, Aug. 10. A gloom was
cast over tho people here yesterday,
when It was learned that at about
noon Mrs. Emma Seamons, wlto of
Ezra Seamons had passed away from,
a sudden attack ot heart fatluie at
their homo near Battle Creek, a few
miles north or Preston. As she had
been ailing somowhat during thv
previous night her husband was loth
to leave her; but sho said she would
bo allrlght, and ho went to work a
few miles from home. At noon no
received a phono mesnago to como at
once and bring a doctor. When they
arrived about an hour lator they
found It too late, as she had passed
away a short time before. Tho body
was embalmed and brought here on
Ihe G o'clock car today. Funeral ser
vices will be held In the meeting
house at 2 p. m. Friday, August 11.
About tho same hour that tho body o
Mrs. Seamons arrived, Mr. Louis
Larson arrived at tho house of Mr.
Thomas Nielsen, bringing the sad
news from Fish Haven that Miss Ve
nice Nielsen was In a very critical
condition and tho doctors attending
her had but littlo hopes of her re
covery. Many fond hopes and prayers
are offered that her life may bo spar
ed and sho be permitted to return to
her homo.
Tho hall storm which passed over
our Holds on Tuesday last, did consid
erable damage tc the beet and potato
crops.
Quite a numbor of men and boys
havo been out tho last few days cut
ting the beet seed. The crop is first
clnss this year and clearly proves
that hero In Cache county wo can
raise beet peed as well as In (lor
many, nnd thus furnish a great deal
of employment for our own people.
CACHE DELEGATION
A HUMMER
The Cache County delegation to
tho recent Republican Convention was
a hummer. It did moro rotten thlnps
than could possibly bo expected of
any other delegation, and tliero Is
not much doubt but that It will hold
the record for all tluio But aftor lis
tening to such a putrid apology, such
a malodoious defense of his own acts
as that indicted by tho Hon. Lewis
Larson of Sail Peto, without vomiting
almost any delegation can bo forglvon
for any and a'l acts of whatever na
ture and consequences.

CITY RESERVOIR I
EAST OF COLLEGE jl
IS ABOUT READY 1
Another Improvement Added to the, '
Many Boasted by This M
Administration 9n
The million gallon storage roser- ! m
voir east of the A. C. which Is being ft
uullt by Logan City In order to In- M
crease the efficiency of our city water W
system Is about completed. Tho I If
concrete work will all bo laid to-
night. The contract for the build- PS
Ing of this reservoir has been in tho l
hands of Olof Nelson with City En- I if
glnecr Roy Bullen supervising. Engl- 1 9
neer Ray B. West of tho A. C. has ijffl
been tho Injpoctor on tho Job, nnd ijjfl
nfter tho work has passed tho' hands jgi
of thoso officials no one need tia I
any concern that wo have a roser- ifM
voir equal to any in tho entire coua- i'H
try. IB
The capacity of the reservoir is ono '. H
million gallons, it is divided into !'H
two sections of five hundred thousand : Wg
gallons each, and Is so constructed iH
that one section can bo used while Q
tho othei can be drained and flushed. 9B
The structuro Is 60 feet wldo inside ' m
and 220 feet in length. It Is 11 feet Jil
from the tloor to the celling; the cell- H
Ing consisting of a thick layer or con- HBJ
Crete is held In place by concrete !fS
Piers extending upward from th4 H
tloor. When completed tho structure H
will cost approximately $17,000. I H
With this row reservoir our system j jj9
should be more ovenly balanced than ' JB
at the present time. It will gtvo a I
30 foot better head and consequently iWt
should glye a moro oven pressure or- I M
er the entire system. This Is one U
more improvement added to the many H
ot the present city administration, 1 1
and is ono In which ovcry citizen ot H
this fair city can well be proud. B
