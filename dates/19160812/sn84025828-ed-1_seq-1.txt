Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
There aro citizens who believe that
It Is contrary to good public policy In
a freo country to put too many ot the
public offices In one community In
the possession of members ot a slnglo
family.
The throats made by members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
tho Connerys have on public affairs.
Tho result is startling and ot in
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang ot
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can use tho United States Gov
eminent in their business.
They evidently havo found the
State of Illinois,
County ot Cook and
City ot Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to tho family .possessions.
Democrats in Chicago are wonder
lng why all of the public jobs are not
given to Conner)''".
It may be due to the fact that there
re not enough Connerys to go around.
Connerys First!
What a noble family motto that is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Conaflrys and their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Blockl as you
may have heard him referred to, a
partner ot John T. Connery In the coal
business, Is a member ot the Board
ot Review.
WlUlam J. Connery, nephew ot John
T. Connery. holds the nice-salaried
job of Secretary ot Reviewer Blockl.
Partner Blockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts In which tho Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the publto Interest In them
ver wholly died out
There was a number ot "talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of these
worthies before as our files will at
test. But talking ot the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
It about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that Borne membors of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1907 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon. by many In
the light of tho Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
If not to all, ot the jobs In Us gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great.
When John W. Ralnoy, always a
good Democrat and an ablo man, was
running for Clerk of tho Circuit Court
In 1912, the Connory outfit fought
him at the polls In favor ot Joseph
E. Bidwlll, Jr., a Republican.
Whon Robert M. Swoltzor was run
ning for tho Democratic nomination
for Mayor In 1915, tho Connerys saw
another chanco to put a member of the
family in that offleo and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, thon City
Clerk and now Comptroller of tho
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach was
showing signs of balking nt nn over
dlot of Connory and tho noblo Francis
D. was sent back to tho payroll to
wait for anothor chanco.
Swoltzor got tho nomination and it
Is said that the Connory following
did not forglvo him for crowding out
oho ot tho princes ot tho blood and
were not over-cnthuslastlc for Swolt
zor's election to say tho least.
This year tho Connory's are not
asking for much,
It is reported that Joseph 1?. Bid

CONNERY TAXES
Items About Them; Gleamed from Printed
Personal Property Assessments; Also,
the Taxes Levied on Labor Unions.
The publlo Is naturally anxious to
know what personal property taxes
its office holders pay. So much has
been said about the number of Con
nerys holding publlo office in Chicago
that many inquiries havo been made
aa to what personal property assess
ments are laid against these patriotic
persons by the Board of Assessors.
The printed lists of personal proper
ty assessments tor 1916 show tho fol
lowing facts:
Joseph F. Connery, Recorder of
Deeds, at a salary of $9,000 a. year;
also said to be secretary of a grave
yard company, salary not learned and
real estate dealer at 134 South La
Salle street. House, 2028 West Wash
ington boulevard.

trict 34, West Town, $400.

Tho Board ot Assessors makes
somo very curious mistakes. ' It ap

Residents of Edgowntor in tho vi

Tho using of Sheridan Road as a

much Indignation.
WANTS THEM SHOWN UP
To tho Editor:
At a llttlo gathering of half a
dozen members of tho Chicago Bar
the other day tho unanimous wish was
expressed that xorno of tho taxdodg
lng public officials and others who
boast of their wealth, enjoy big In
comes, draw largo salaries, hold big
Investments, live high, drive costly
automobiles and put on stylo could be
brought into court cither as plnlntlfTs
or defendants in olthor criminal or
civil actions so that tho truth could
bo extracted from them on tho stand
about their personal piopcrty hold
ings. If they would not tell tho truth un
der oath on tho witness stand In a
court ot record thoy could bo punished
for perjury.
Let us get at the truth about theso
fellows.
THIRTY YEARS A LAWYER.
Inducing people to buy property bo
cause ot Its proximity to Lako Mich
igan and then fencing them off from
the enjoyment of tho lake Is ono ot
tho many complaints justly made by
Edgewater peoplo against a gang ot
exploiters.
Building fences to keep tho com
mon herd off the Lako Front Is not
favored by Edgewater residents.
Mr. John T. Connery's namo and as
sessment, was at fault, as witness
this letter:
BOARD OF ASSESSORS.

Mr. John T. Connery,

error the Printed List for District No.

a Full Value ot $2,100.
Respectfully yours,
BOARD OF ASSESSORS,
By CHARLES KRUTCKOFF.
Peoplo know enough about this
Board of Assessors to bollovo that it
would stop at nothing.
But no one suspected It of being
so hardened as to commit a "typo
graphical error."
J. T. Connerys name does not ap
pear on tho printed assessment list
which includes the territory in which
his business olllco nt 332 South Mich
igan avonuo Is located, In District 20,

Tho Miami Coal Company at 332 S.
Michigan avenue, of which Mr. Con
nory Is president, nnd Rovlower
Blockl Is vleo president, Is assessed
on a Full Valuo of $3,000.
Labor organizations do not appear
to escape tho vlgllnuco ot tho Asses

F0R60T GERMANS

So-called Democrats have nominated
a ticket without a German by birth or

A Connery Is on It of course, for

Not n man on tho ticket had an
American grandfather, the only out

POOR VOTE GETTERS
Although the Connerys Hold
Many Public Jobs They Are
Not Strong at the Ballot
Box.
At tho Democratic primary for Re
corder ot Deeds In 1912 tho result
was:
Joseph F. Connery 56,343
His opponents ,. 64,493
So Connory was a minority nomi
nee. At tho same primary John W. Ral
noy ran for tho nomination for Clork
ot tho Circuit Court, tho olllco held by
Connery's Republican nophow-ln-law,
Joseph E. Bldwell, Jr. Result ot tho
primary:
John W. Ralnoy 71,695
All opponents 44,606
Ralneyls majority over
all .27.029
At. the sarao i primary, In, 1912 John
T. Connery's partner In the coal busi
ness, Blockl, was a candidate for tho
nomination for Board ot Review. Tho
result:
Blockl, Connery's part
ner 39,415
His opponents 87,253
So Blockl, Connery s partner, was In
a minority ot 47,838 votes. One ot hit
opponents, Charles J. Voplcka, came
near defeating Block!, Connery's part
ner, receiving 38,989 votes to Blockl,
Connery's partner's 39,415.
In 1913, Francis D. Connory was a
candldato at tho Democratic primary
for tho nomination for City Clerk.
Frnncls D. Connory 42,187
His Democratic opponents 51,460
So Connory was very much ot a
minority candidate.
