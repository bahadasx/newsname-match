MINING ACTIVITIES IN STE-
YENS COUNTY.
In speaking of the marvelous
development of the mining indus
try in Stevens county within the
last year, Mining Truth of Spo
kane says:
Frain tin- viewpoint of Spo
kane the development of northern
mining districts is the most im
portant phase of the recent re
vival—a movement that has saved
the city from commercial stagna
tion once more and to which is al
most wholly due the fair condition
of business. Without the impetus
received from mines, it is certain
that partial stagnation would have
ruled where reasonable activity is
now evident.
Stevens and Ferry counties are
directly tributary to Spokane. To
this city tin* miner, the merchant
and the farmer must look for sup
plies and recreation. To it comes
the spare dollars won in the mines
and farms and there is no logical
reason why the future should not
record a marked increase in the
mutual benefits so derived. One
tilling is necessary to weld this
business permanently to us and
thai is further effort on the part
of Spokane merchants. So far,
business has come to use in spite
of lack of organized effort, rather
than through it. and there is little
doubt thai the feeling entertained
toward us by our northern neigh
bors could be improved.
The most important events con
tributing to the present satisfac
tory conditions are the reopening
and successful operation of the
Xorthport smelter by the Day in
terests; the discovery and satis
factory development of the; great
Electric Point lead deposits twen
ty miles east of Northport; the
record of zinc production made by
the Grviat Western and Last
Chance properties of Norman
Mines Co.. six miles southeast of
Xorthport; the acquisition of im
portant interests in Republic dis
trict by the Day family in aid of
their smelting enterprise; the
promise of early dividends by
United Copper, at Chewelah, now
fully equipped for economical
production, and the resuscitation
of the old Loon Lake copper de
posits after twenty years of in
activity.
The old Cleveland mine, op
erated 2"> years ago by Jay I.
Graves, has been reopened; the
Deer Trail No. 2, which paid divi
dends 20 years ago, is being equip
ped with milling facilities; the
Bonanza, near Bossburg, is ship
ping approximately 100 tons a
month of high grade silver-lead
ore; Republic is shipping to Brit
ish Columbia smelters on a basis
not heretofore reached ; many new
enterprises are under way at Che
welah. with promise of success;
the Laurier mine, in the extreme
northeast corner of Ferry county
is now upon a producing basis
and from every corner of the two
counties come reports of import
ant strikes and resumption of ac
tivities on properties always of
promise, but neglected for many
years in the rush hither and
thither—the call of the perepatetic
prospector to pastures new.
A day's journey over the tracks
of the Spokane Falls & Northern
railroad will convey a fair impres
sion of the wonderful changes
wrought by the revival of mining
interest. Mites of track have been
renewed and where one train oc
casionally labored slowly over the
almost grass-grown tracks, many
now haul the products of Coeur
d'Alene and other mines to North
port and return laden with ores
tli.ii seek smelting treatment in
distant parts of the country.
From the property of Norman
Mines Co. alone nearly 2,000 tons
of zinc carbonate ores have been
shipped in the past few months
to smelters in Oklahoma and Kau
nas. The amount is not large as
mining g»vt>, but it serves to show
thi change thai has occured in
the territory covered by this ar
ticle.
Electric point has just com
nuii ,(I shipments of the purest
leiiil nivs ever mined in this state.
Much preliminary work has been
accomplished since its discovery
just nver one year ago and now
perhaps 7(1 tons a day are being
sent forward to the big smelter at
Trail. At present prices it seems
reasonable to look for monthly
earnings of $100,000.
At Northport the slumbrous si
lehce of six months ago has given
win to the song of the hammer
anil saw and on every hand new
dwellings are springing up to
holism the hundreds who gain live
lihood through the enterprise of
the Day family. Two 250-ton lead
furnaces have been in operation
at the smelter for several mouths;
another will be in operation with
in ii few weeks; a fourth has been
ordered and a fifth will be placed
in position without delay.
When these improvements are
completed Northport will boast of
a smelter as complete as any in the
wesi. with capacity of 1,250 tons
per day -lust now the equipment
is not of sufficient capacity to
look after the production of the
Alcne mines owned by the
Da\ family but when the com
plete equipment has been installed
Northport will become an import
ant custom smelting point, thus
benefiting every prospect in the
northern tier of counties. Rumor
says thai copper furnaces will
alsn lie installed in good time.
Meanwhile Northport has be
come one of the most thrifty anil
active communities within trading
distance of Spokane and is grow
ing daily. Prospectors are plying
their vocation in the surrounding
liills and before the first snow
calls them back to winter quarters
many discoveries will have been
recorded with promise of added
activity.
Across the Columbia river from
Xorthport the Coyote is develop
ing into a property of promise and
already high grade silver-lead ore
is ready for shipment. Off to the
north, around Red Top mountain,
old properties are being opened
up and many new strikes of im
portance have been made. All
this activity is within 120 miles
of the main corner of the city of
Spokane.
THE JUNO-ECHO
The sensation of tin' week in
milling development in the great
mineral area north of JSpokane is
the opening of eight feet of cop
per ore on the 150-foot level in
the Juno-Echo property one and
three-quarter miles east of Chews
lab. The vein has been cut at
this point and drifted upon about
:'.<) feet in each direction, north
and south, and shows clean walls
of what appears to be a. fissure
cutting the granite and porphy
litie prevailing country rock,
showing a continuation from the
surface where the vein has been
stripped for more than 100 feet.
The vein filling is about three feet
of chalcopyrite aguinst the east
or hanging wall, from 2 to 4 feet
of quartz intervenes and a well de
fined vein of from 2 inches to one
loot of mine pure molybdenite
follows the foot wall. The gangue
assays $17 80, the quartz filling
from .$25.90 to $50.70, and the
chalcopyrite from $111.4* to $132.
The principal values are in copper.

located the ground and started the
excitement off right by laying out
the town of [rabrie which they
promised would rival the richest
camps of the west in wealth and
the race for commercial favor.
For more than 20 years they ex
emplified their faith in the camp
by linking numerous prospect
holes upon the two parallel veins
which traverse the ground and are
separated by about 400 feet of
country. Finally they ga%'e it up
and vanished. Others came, re
located the ground, did the assess
incut work for a year or so and let
it drop.
Two years ago 11. R. Spedden
took over the property to avoid
litigation which threatened to in
volve a situation which presaged
another failure, and by securing
cooperation of lien claimants be
gan work in some of the old open
ings, Less than a dozen rounds
of holes were blasted when they
shot into the ore in the shaft.
The drift shows that the vein of
three feel on the surface is contin
uous to the 150 foot level, where i!
thickens to 8 feet on a dig of 80
degrees from the perpendicular
with no indication of a break be
low. The ore shoot, according to
development at the north end is
fully :!"(> feet long and proves the
value of the ground from a pros
pect to a mine. The ledge on
both mineral /ones is over 60 feet
in width.
The Juno-Echo is equipped with
h :i."> horse power steam plant with
compressor and hoist and operates
two [ngersol-Rand drills with twn
shifts of four men. A Larger plant

lie milled. A separating plant i.
Have the molybdenum will also be
included. The present equipment
is rudimentary and will he re

There is sufficient water and tim
ber mi the <>4 acres of ground to
answer all purposes and the conn
ty road over the property reaches
the Great Northern station at Che
welah at two miles. The first car
if ore is in the bini ready for ship
ment and will go to (Iran by.
The importance of the Juno-
Echo strike has given new and
permanent push to the stability of
riiewelah camp and this new con
fidence is noticeable by renewed
activities throughout the district.
The Juno-Echo stock, which was
Helling at 5c has been taken off
tin' market as a result of the big
strike.
THE WELLS-FARGO
The Wells/Fargo mine, situated
mi Huckleberry mountain I** miles
west of Springdale is probably the
largesi producer of antimony in
the Htate if not in the northwest.
This property was discovered 26
years ago and the prospectors who
Htaked it declare that there were
old mineral location stakes on the
ground which were set there 25
years or more before The prop
erty is on the east slope of the
elevation and about one mile dist
