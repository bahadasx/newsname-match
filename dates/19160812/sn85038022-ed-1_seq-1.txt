'The Square Deal Man"
New York, August 11 Whether
the leaders of 400,000 employes of the
railroads of the country will make
pood their threats f a general strike
unless their demands for an tight
hour day and time and one-half for
overtime are granted by the managers
of 235 railway systems, probably will
b" known tomorrow. It was learned
here tonight from an authoritative
source.
The only hopo of a peaceful setle
ment apparently rested tonight on the
possibility that the men might be In
duced to accept a new form of arbi
tration, although thus far they have
steadfastly refused all such proposals.
Their chief objection to arbitration
bas been the lack of representation
upon any of the boards provided un
der the existing statutes.
Meiators' Activity Halted
The members of the Federal Board
o' Mediation and Conciliation, while
declining to discuss the situation, arc
said to be hopeful that an expansion
ot'the size of the board provided for
under the Newlarajs act may meet
this objection. Efforts to obtain from
Washington approval of this plan was
reported to have been responsible for
the apparent suspension of the media
tors' activities today.
if this suggestion is not accepted
it was said tonight, the mediation
board will have failed In Its efforts
und the only recourse will he an ap
peal to President Wilson to use his
influence to avert a strike, it was
pointed out, however, that the Presi
dent's power will be limited to sug
gestions and recommendations.
Krotherhood Rejects Newlands Act
Leaders of the Brotherhood have
declared that they would not consider
arbitration under the New lands act
as It now stands. The railroads have
rejected the men's demands and have
stood out firmly for arbitration. The
men have Berved notice that rather
than arbitrate they would strlko. With
both sides taking such an unbending
attitude there Is no solution to the
problem except the new arbitration
plan, according to a responsible au
thority. The principal feature of the new
plan is said to be tho formation of a
Hoard of Arbitration that will give
each of the fourth brotherhoods a rep
resentative on the board, while the
arbitrators of the railroads will be In
creased to an equal number, with
four ueutral arbitrators, making a
total membership of twelve.
