GREAT STRIKE IS
IN BALANCE AS
MEDIATION FAILS
Board Makes Effort to Induce
Brotherhoods to Arbitradte;
Decision Tomorrow
WILSON LAST CHANCE
If He Fails to Bring Sides To
gether Nation-Wide Strike
Will Be Called
By Associated Press
New York, Aug. 12.—Whether a
ration-wide railroad strike is to be
called or prevented still hung in the
balance to-day after the United States
Board of Mediation and Conciiation,
announcing that mediation had failed,
made an effort to induce the railroad
brotherhoods to arbitrate their differ
ences with the railroad manaers.
The brotherhoods, after discussing
an arbitration proposal made to them
by the board under the Xew lands act,
adjourned without reaching a decision.
They announced that an answer would
be given to-morrow morning at an
other meeting of the chiefs and dele
ates of the brotherhoods.
Want Specific Decision
A. B. Garretscn. head of the con
ductors' brotherhood, said after the
meeting that in proposing arbitration
the members of the mediation board
had not informed the men whether
the railroad managers had any spe
cific questions to arbitrate and that
they would propose that the media
tors obtain from the managers a more
definite propositicn. He indicated that
the arbitration proposal was a gen
eral one and that the men were with
holding decision to learn if the rail
roads cared to be specific.
"We arrived at no decision to-day,"
said Mr. Garretron.
"The men will meet to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock with the media
tors and unless we find that the me
diators are in a position to state defi
nitely that the railroads will agree to
arbitrate there can be no further
progress in the matter."
Mr. Garretson described as "prema
ture" a statement made by a delegate
who left the meeting before it ad
journed that the men had rejected
the arbitration proposal and voted to
lay the situation before President
Wilson. He, said, however, that the
statement of the men was still opposed
to arbitration, opposition to which they
have taken on the ground that previous
arbitrations have proved unfavorable.
The fact, however, that the men
delayed their decision on the matter
gave rise to the hope that they might
finally recede from their attitude. The
railroad managers reiterated, today,
their determination to fight for the
arbitration principle.. which, they said.
If they gave up would mean that they
were forever afterward at the mercy
of their employes.
Upon the decision of the employes
as to whether this form of arbitration
will be accepted depends the-question
of calling a nation-wide strike lies in
en appeal to President Wilson to use
his good offices in a last effort to bring
the disputants together.
Opposed Enlargement
Announcement of the failure of me
diation was made by Martin A. Knapp,
a member of the mediation board,
after a conference of the mediators
with the brotherhood chiefs which
lasted more than an hour. The pre
cise terms of the new arbitration pro
posal were not made public, but the
proposal is understood to involve an

EXPERT SUGGESTS
NEW HIGH SCHOOL
FOR OLDER GIRLS
Accommodate All Boys With
Additional Facilities at
Technical
3 JUNIOR INSTITUTIONS
Urges Immediate Relief at Cen
tral; Cost $550,000; None
on Hill
Solution of Harrisburg's much
mooted High school problem for the
next ten years is suggested by Dr.
James H. Van Sickle, the expert em
ployed by the school board to make a
complete survey of the situation.
The recommendations follow:
\cw High school for girls of
senior age only, to front on or
near the Capitol park if possible.
Additions to Technical High
school sufficient to accommodate
all boys of senior age.
Three junior High schools for
accommodation of pupils of the
freshmen class of the High school
and of the seventh and eighth
grammar grades.
Cost of new High school in
cluding furnishings not to exceed
$300,000.
Cost of Technical High school
additions or annex not to exceed
$175,000.
New girls' High school should
be large enough to provide ac
commodations for nt least 1,000.
Addition to Technical High
school for boys should be large
enough to provide accommoda
tions for at least 800.
Such recommendations, if car
ried out, sufficient to supply
High school needs until 1925 or
perhaps a year or two longer.
The Public View
The result of the survey was em
bodied in a comprehensive report yes
terday afternoon to a special com
mittee of the board consisting of the
Rev. Dr. William N. Yates, and Di
rectors Harry A. Boyer, Harry M.
Bretz, Robert A. Enders, C. E. L.
and A. Carson Stamm. This
committee referred the report to a
special committee consisting of Presi
dent Stamm and Dr. F. E. Downes.
city superintendent, and this commit
tee will digest the findings and sub
mit them with further suggestions to
the school board at its next meeting.
In the meantime the public will have
a chance to consider the finding of
Dr. Van Sickle.. with, a view to ex
pressing its views by voting upon a
new High school loan in November.
The special committee appointed
by the board was subdivided to facil
itate the work as follows: Messrs.
Yates and Bretz as a committee on
"co-education and junior High
schools"; Messrs. Boyer and Stamm,
on "building," Messrs. Enders and
Keen, on "site" and Messrs. Yates
and Stamm on "experts."
The Experts' Finding
Dr. Van Sickle of Springfield, Mass.,
was employed to make the survey and
he was very ably assisted by Dr.
Downes, and by data collected from
the school, city and health board
offices.
The expert in presenting his report
went into comprehensive detail on the
following points:
The present need of relief for the
Central High school; accommodations
and facilities that should be provided
to meet modern and approved educa
tional ideas and demands, including
location of necessary buildings, prob
able cost of project, including fur
nishings, but not sites; probable
length of time such buildings will
meet the High school needs of the
community.
Some Historical Data
In reporting upon the High school
situation Dr. Van Sickle of course took
into consideration, the directions of
the city's growth, the traffic conditions
and the other possibilities which have
heretofore been treated in surveys by
Superintendent Snyder, the Jersey
City expert and in the Arnold re
port to the Municipal League a year
ago. Some of his data was built upon
figures that had been submitted in
these reports. Dr. Van Sickle how
ever, made a thorough inspection of
the schools of the city on his behalf
and visited all the proposed or pos
sible sites.
said he in this connec
tion. that 1 understand the nature
of the problem with which the city
is confronted in the development of its
school system."

the working people not to ride on the
cars, and was pleased when he heard
that some hundred steel workers had
