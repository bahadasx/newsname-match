By Ed L. Keen.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Aug. 12. The advance guard
of the Russian force that occupied
Stanislau pressed on two miles north
east of the city and crossed the river
Zlota Bistritza, 18 miles south of Halitz,
necording to Petrograd dispatches to
day. The Austro-Germans offered but weak
Tr-sistance and then continued their re
treat north. Several guns were abond
oued by the enemy in their retreat from
1 lie Zlota Bistritza.
Two separate Russian forces are now
fmiverging on Halitz, the immediate
objective of General I.etchitsky In his
drive against I.emberg. The first, niov
jug eastward along the north bank of
the Dniester, is less than 20 miles from
Halitz. The second force operating
south of the Dniester is composed of
tlie detachments that took Stanislau.
There is no indication in dispatcher
from cither Petrogrnd, Berlin or Vienna
that the Russian advance, tho most
Tapid made by any army since the Aus-tro-German
Balkan campaign has been
plowed up. In four days they have pro
gressed 20 miles and in the fighting
about Stanislau alone they have taken
nearly 20 villages and towns.
Battling over much more difficult
country, the Italians scored successes
of equal importance in their southward
swing toward Trieste. The news from
Itoth Petrograd and Home suggests that
the demoralization of the Austrian arm
ies may be more complete than earlier
advices indicated.
No official statement has been made
public here thus far of the activities in
the Balkans reported from Paris yester
day. German Attacks Repulsed.
Paris, Aug. 12. The French repulsed
heavy German attacks on both sides of
the Somme last night, it was officially
announced today and made further pro
gress on the front northeast of Ver
dun. At 9 o'clock last night the Germans
launched an attack against the Hem
quarry, north of the Somme, losing heav
ily. South of the Somme the Germans
delivered an attack against La Maison
ette. This attempt was checked bv
French screen fire befofo the enemy
itebouched.
On the Verdun front, French detach
ments made progress south of Thiau
mont work and repulsed two German at1
tacks at Fleury. Artillery combats oc
curred on the sectors of Yaux Chapitre
and Chenois.
Italians Score Victories.
Rome, Aug. 12. Italian troops have
scored further victories south of Goritz,
crossing the Vallone and enrying the
Avestern slopes of Monte Nadlogen, it
was officially announced this afternoon.
Italian detachments have occupied Op
jiac.hiasella. Oppnchiasella lies six miles south of
Goritz and about two miles southeast

MEXICAN EXILES ARE
Big Landowners at Outs with
Carranza Trying to Start
Revolution
By Webb Miller.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, Aug, 12. "Trouble
for the United States and the Car
ranza government is afoot and is being
stirred up right here in El Paso by a
number of wealthy Mexican exiles who
desire Carranza 's overthrow and Amer
icas intervention, if necessary," stated
a government official today.
Several silent and mysterious strang
ers, reported to be agents of the exiles,
have been seen around Et Paso hotels,
conferring with influential Mexicans.
These men are under surveillance by
United States secret service men.
"Behind the projected revolution,"
stated tho government official, "are a
number of Mexicans owning millions
of acres of land in Mexico but now
living in Los Angeles, San Antonio
and other southern places. They are
"at outs" with the de facto govern
ment and the safety of their wealth
depends upon the crumbling of the
Carranza regime. They are going
about their revolutionary activities
cautiously.
"Some of the Carranza garrisons
are undermined now, I believe," de
clared tho official. "Colonel Mariano
Tames of the Juarez garrison was
bought but loyal C'arranzistas discov
ered his plans and forced him to flee
for safety."
Along the border American customs
riders and army outposts are on the
alert today to prevent smuggling of am
munition into Mexico for the "in
surrectos." 19

HAS ITEMS TABULATED
Has Regained His Old Tricks
Including Attention to
Babies
By Perry Arnold, ,
(United Press stnff correspondent.)
Helena, Mont., Aug. 12. Governor
Hughes expects to try a new campnign-
ng stunt this ntternoou. He joyfully
accepted an invitation to descend 2,800
feet into the depths of the Leonard cop
per mine at Butte. Mrs. Hughes, who
hasn t quitted her husband s side
through the hnrdshipa of the trans-con
tinental trip, which her husband Is mak
ing to win votes for the presidency,
wanted to go, but it was decided she
had better not.
John Mcintosh, of Butte, who joined
the republican nominee's party here to
day, made the announcement of the gov
ernor's underground' search for vote
He told the governor the trip might
prove of interest but he wanted to warn
uim m advance that mines weren't the
safest things in the world and that he
did not have to accept the invitation.
"You can be I want to go," the gov
ernor responded quickly. "There are
lots of men who work In mines every
day and I m not in the least afraid any
wav." : .
The Leonard mine is not the biggest
of Butte's wilder earth industries, but
the commiFfciTTielil it td better adnp
ed for sight seeing. The governor will
be furnished jumper and overalls.
Ready for the Fray.
Governor Hughes today reached that
point in his assault on the democratic
trenches nt which a European army com
mander would report himself ready for
the concerted attack at a particular
point. The republican candidate feels
he has done the preparatory work in the
24 campaign speeches he has made since
leaving New York one week ago to
day. He has Indicated that his main
reliance in assault is the weapon of
criticism of democratic alleged inef
ficiency. From now on the governor pro'
poses to back up this general charge
with concerted fire. . He is armed with
specific instances which the republicans
claim will support the general allega
tion. In his speeches hereafter, he will
use this definite data to back up his
preparatory assault.
In the one week's campaigning to
date it appears that the republican main
assault will be against democratic inef
ficiency and Included in this criticism
will be the Mexicnn policy; the foreign
policy; the "pork barrel" policy; the
preparedness policy, the tariff policy,
and the administrative policy.
The phrase which has so far evoked
the most applause from the nominee's
auditors has been, "I'd like to nave a
chance to investigate the democratic ad
ministration," anil today, when Hughes
"pulled it" here again in slightly dif
ferent phraseology, the crowd remem
bered that the man now running for the
presidency first made his reputation in
the senrchinely inquisitive probe of the
New York Life Insurance scandal. He

was appinuiieu iu uiti vi-uu.
Has Many Political Tricks.
Hughes is considerably changed frem
the man who late in June stepped out
of the cloistered precincts of the su
preme court into the vortex of politics.
He has regained all his old tricks of
oratory, of gesture, of modulation of
his voice, of paying attention to bnbies,
ot working up laughs, of posing patient
ly for ubiquitous photographers, profei
sionals and amnteurs. Ho has "come
back" into the sort of campaign orator
that he was in the (lavs of his nnti-race
truck crusade in New York state.
Today Hughes' voice was almost
normal, strong and clear, and the zip in
the air put more and more pep into his
gestures and Ins thoughts.
Last night tho nominee gave Billings,
Mont., 1,100 worth of oratory. The
citv paid exactly that much raised by
public suoscriptian among republicans
to pay expenses of diverting nis train
to this city for a speech. After the talk
they were unanimous in the asserdtion
that it was worth it.
Jumps Onto Villa. ,
He characterized Villa as "an ac
complished assasin in his own right;"
declared he "had no patience with sub
terranean diplomacy," anil asserted
j that some diplomats were of about as
much use as the Atlantic cable. He
labeled his opponents as "that dear old
party which has been misunderstanding
the people for a long period before I
was born," and berated any democratic
idea that "public office is a private
snap." His speech picked out sections
of democratic platforms from 1350 on
for ridicule and denunciation.
"The executive," he said, "is the

TO
Do Not Indorse Hughes But
Will Work for Him Just
the Same
Colorado Springs, Colo., Aug. 12.
Organizers of the National Women's
party met here today in the dosing
sessions of their first conference to
plan a $500,000 campaign in the 12
suffrage states along .the lines lnid but
in resolutions adopted yesterday.
The declared policy of the party is
"to use its best efforts to defeat the
democratic candidate for president and
tne democratic candidates for congress
so long as their opposition to the fed
eral amendment enfranchising women
continues."
While the eonference unanimously
"congratulated" progressive, prohibi
tion and socialist parties and "com
mended" Charles E. Hughes for their
stand in favor of national woman suf
frage, many of the organizers today
announced their determination to wage
the campaign strictly in behalf of the
republican presidential candidate.
Miss Anne Martin stated that the
general policy, which did not indorse
any specific candidate, was merely
"polititnl expediency."
A majority of the leaders of the wo
men's party are women who have
sacrificed comfort and luxury in their
home states to tak up legal residence
in suffrage states' and - vote. Miss
Elsie Hill moved from Connecticut to
Colorado. Mrs. Harriet Stanton Blntch
left New York and rented an "at
tick" in Kansas, she said; Mrs. E. St.
Clair Thompson of an old South Caroli
na family, has taken up her residence
in Arizona. Miss Marjorie Ross of
Pittsburg became a Wyoming home

controversy between 400,000 railway
employes nnd the railway managers of
tho country this afternoon nppenred im
possible without an appeal to President
Wilsou or a strike tying up 25 railroads
of the country, .
Members of the federal board of med
iation and conciliation have not aband
oned hope. They were endeavoring to
fiersuade the employes to consent to ar
itration this afternoon. So far this has
been rejected.
Mediation has failed. The railway
managers insist they are ready to face
a strike if the men refuse to arbitrate.
The employes just as firmly reiterated
that arbitration has failed before, and
consequently they cannot consent to it
now.
While continuing their work, the me
diators are dubious of success. After
a Bession with (100 representatives ot
the trainmen which lasted several hours,
it was admitted no progress had been
made toward bringiug about arbitra
tion. One of the brotherhood officers leav
ing Webster hull stated that arbitra
tion had been rejected. President A.
B. Garertson of the conductors brother
hood, cleared this up when he emerged,
however, declaring that while the broth
erhoods still maintained the position
announced at the opening of negotia
tions, further meetings with the medi
ators will be held tomorrow.
Mediation Has Failed.
"I have nothing to report," suid Gar

Chairman IKSgly
Urging He Make Trip
Through Valley
CharlesEvans Hughes, republican
candidate for president may or may
not deliver a campaign address in
Snfem. The situation is about like
this;
Judge C. L. McNary, chairman of
the-republican state central committee
has been urging the campaign managers
to permit Mr Hughes to speak in the
Willamette valley where a large per
centage of the rural people of the state
live, where he would have opportunity
to address from 60,000 to 00,000 people.
Judge McNary 's plan is to have the
candidate leave Portland, next Wednes
day morning on tho . Oregon Electric
and muke short stops at Salem, Albany
and Eugene, returning that evening in
time for the 8 o'clock mass meeting at
the ice hippodrome.
On account of the bad condition of
the candidate's voice this plan was op
posed br the campaign managers who
contended that Mr. Hughes needed all
day Wednesday for resting.
On behalf of the Oregon committee,
Judge McNary telegraphed the presi
dential party ' yesterday in North Da
kota, setting forth the advantages of
a visit in the valley and asking them
to change their present pluns As yet,
no answer has been received, and the
question as to whether Salem folks
will see and hear the candidate is un
decided. Mr. Rodney, who has charge to some
extent of the itinerary, thought that
Mr. Hughes would be willing if his
voice holds out Anyhow, Judge Mc
Nary feels that he has done everything
that could be done to give the people
of the valley an opportunity to hear
the republican candidate.

Chicacro. Aue. 12. An estimated loss)
of $100,000,000 in Russian trade to Am
erican firms within the last eight
months through theft or delay of cables
by the British censors was charged to
day by A. H. vPottnikof, president of
the International Manufacturers' Hale
company.
Postuikoi substantiated United Press
dispatches from Petrograd stating that
efforts are being made to lay a direct
nohlo Vmlwopn RimHin. nnH America. He
declared this was being done because of
tne Inability to get proper caoie iram
mission of Russian orders through the
Bpitish censor.
He charged that Great Britain has
been actually stealing American trade,
.Ilk V,a jlaolnvofinn Hint! nut. of 50
cables received by his company in the
Inst eight montns oniy live nave vm.
transmitted in their original form.
"Whilo I have no direct proof that
Great Britain has garbled our cables to
throw trade: to their own manufacture,
T nm nrnttv certain that such is the
case," said Postuikof. - ' -
"In tho past eight months eigni
cables from here to our Petrograd of
fice nnd from that office to this office
seven have been lost,
" ' Would Kill Ottr Trad.
"No doubt exists in my mind that
Great Britain is using every possible
means, fair or foul, to interfere, and
if possible, put an end to direct trade
rclutions between the United States and
other countries. Great Britain ia, par
ticularly desirous of discouraging such
trade botween American firms and their
Russian customers.
"Prior to the war, Germany enjoyed
this lucrative position in all our deat
ings with Russia."
The International Manufacturer'
Snles company is a subsidiary sales or
ganization of SO American firms, repre
senting a total capital of $400,000,000.
Postuikof said his concerns proved to
Washington regarding the censorship of
their cables and that considerable cor
respondence with the state department
followed. Nine cables from the com
pany's Russian offices are still jnisa
ing, Postnikof declared. .
"Tho loss to America as a result of
the British thefts will run over $100,-
nOO 000 " ha aniit.
Ho declared that absolute proof of
theft by the British censor has been
laid beforo the Btate department by a
largo American corporation. This cor
poration, he said, is located in Pitta
burg. Postnikof considers the situation so
serious that he plans to leave for New
York tonight to confer with Newcomb
Carlton, head of the Western Union
Telegraph company- regarding the' lay
ing of cables between Russia and thia
country.
