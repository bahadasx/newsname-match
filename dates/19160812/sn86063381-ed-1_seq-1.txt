SUPREME COURT
TAKES COGNIZANCE
OF SALOON EVIL
Hands Down a Decision in Interna
tional Falls Saloon Brawl
Case.
BAR-ROOM-ASSAULTS
ARE VERY FREQUENT
Voter Can Rid County of Brawls by
Voting at County Option
Election.
The Minnesota supreme court has
taken judicial cognizance of the sa
loon evil.
John B. Tubbs, a bartender at In
International Falls, lost his right eye
when a patron who was so drunk he
did not know what he was doing, in
that playful spirit fostered by drink
ing, gleefully threw a heavy drinking
glass at the bartender, putting out
the eye.
Hands Down Decision.
The Minnesota supreme court in
its decision recently handed down
and reported in the Northwestern
Reporter, volume 158, page 713,
says:
(2) Did this accident "arise
out of" Tubbs.' employment as
bartender? Did this employment
necessarily accentuate the nat
ural hazard from assault to
which all men are subject? In
other words, did bis employment
cause a special degree of ex
posure to the risk? We have no
hesitation in- answering these
questions in the affirmative.
The court will take judicial no
tice that fltie postion of bar
tender, patron or spectator in a
saloon, especially are apt to con
gregate and carouse, is quite apt
to be one of peculiar danger.
Barroom assaults are not of in
frequent occurrence. We had
an illustration of one very re
cently in the case of Lynch vs.
Brennan, 131 Minn. 136, 154 N.
W. 795, and illustrations might

BEMIDJI, MINNESOTA, SATTTRDAY EVENING, AUGUST 12,1916.
WHAT CANADIANS FOUND WHEN THEY CAPTURED GERMAN DUG-OUT
DO IT MONDAY.
What' is it you are going to
do Monday?
Vote.\ 'C:.:
Be sure and vote!
Vote yes or no, but vote!
Whehvthe votes of the county
option election are counted we
want to know whether Beltrami
county is progressive and will
be a good morally clean place
for family homes or whether we
are still controlled by tainted
money of the liquor men. We
do not ^a^fe^^fret tteaTthe real"
sentiment of the county was not
expressed because some of the
stay-at-homes did not feel it
worth their while to exercise
this sacred right of suffrage.
This is a tremendously big is
sue and the entire vote of the
county should be cast, even
though this is concededly a Hard
time for the farmers to leave
even the short time it takes to
vote. But we believe that the
farmers appreciate their duty
and will do it-even at the sac
rifice of some of their time.
The Pioneer has stood openly,
for county option and we have
had no hesitation in expressing
our opinion. We hope you will
express your opinion in the bal
lot box just as vigorously
whether or not you are of the
same opinion. A man who
stands up and expresses his posi
tion withour fear or qualification
is respected even by those who
hold contrary opinions. For
him who' refuses to state his
views and neglects to record
them through the ballot box
there is nothing but contempt.
If you would have the respect
of your neighbor, of your family
or of your county, vote Monday
so that when you are asked you
can proudly state that you have
done your duty.

erence to other decided eases.,
Answer to Arguments.
Now the drinks that the drunken
sop absorbed may have been very sat
isfactory to him and the liquor men
will doubtless argue that he had the
personal right to drink if he wanted
to, but what about Mr. Tubbs? How
about that eye he lost? Will the sa
loon men replace it or hasn't Mr.
Tubbs any personal rights.
But to touch upon another phase
there Are Voices And Voices
\AXJ&L 2a^'rdq4t**
of the matter," as an answer to an
article circulated by the "wets" in
Beltrami county that we cannot af
ford to prosecute liquor violations un
der county option, read again the
sentences by the Minnesota supreme
court, "Barroom assaults are not of
infrequent occurrence. We had an
illuiiration of one very recently in
the case of Lynch v. Brennan, 131.
Minn. 136, 154 N. W. 795, and illus
trations might be multiplied indefin
itely by references to other decided
cases." TO carry these many .cases
to the supreme court costs much, not
orilyin money, but also in physical
crippling of the victim.
Saloon brawls are a disgrace to any
community and Beltrami county is
better off without them.
You, Mr. Voter, can rid the county
of the evil by getting out and voting
next Monday.
