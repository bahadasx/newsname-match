nounced today by Hie Russians. The
most consequential of these were the
capture of the important railway
junction and town of Stanislau, the
ocfn.ilo occupation of Moiiastcr.y

Coupled Willi these victories w.ia the

The potocHsion of Stanislau and
Kolomca makeh secure the Hussion
possession of Hukowina and gives
thim a base for an invasion of Hun

day admitted that a regrouping- of the
Teutonic forces was taking place In
order to meet the new positions of the
Russian army.
Nothing sensational Is happening on
the western front, where tho entente
allies maintain a steady pressure. Al
though the Hritish forces have shown
little activity north of the Homme, the
French report the capture of addi
tional Gorman trenches near Maurc
pas and a fortifldd quarry north of
the Hem wood.
The taking of Stanislau, which Vi
enna says was evacuated without
fighting, opens another gateway
through which the Russians may ad
vance toward I.emberg. Already, Pet-rc-grad
says, the Auslro-Germans are
being pursued toward Hallch, a rail

South of Gorilla along the lower ls

PHILIPPINE FIGHT
Controversy Ilctwoen Public Com
missioners and Corporation
IPMiril In Supreme Court.
MANILA, July 11. A controversy
between the board of public utility
commissioners and Philippine public
service corporations, dating back a
year or more. Is finally to be settled
by the supreme court of the United
States. This will settle the question
of the power of the board to require
annual reports from all public serv
ice corporations.
The act of the legislature which
established the board of public util
ity commissioners gave the board
this authority and the board has
been requiring all transportation
companies, carrying passengers
either on land pr water, to file fi
nancial and operating expenses.
Several transportation companies
challenged the board's authority and
the case went to the supreme court
of the Philippines. That body de
cided that the part of the organic
act establishing the board which
gave it power to demand annual
statements was invalid because it
delegated legislative powers to an
executive or semi-Judicial board.
From this decision the board has
now appealed to the supreme court
of the United Btatea.

Whether there shall be a federal in
vestigation of the high cost of flour
and prospective increases In bread
prices depends largely upon tho re
port of Commissioner Hurley, now
in Chicago, making informal in
quiries for the federal trade com
mission. Mr. Hurley went to Chicago par
ticularly to seek definite information
at the headquarters of the National
Hankers association concerning
statements during the association's
convention at Salt Lake that the
price of bread soon would be in
creased. Officials of the commission
said today, however, that they would
look Into tho general question of
flour and bread prices.
The departments of agriculture
and Justice, as well as the trado
commission, are giving attention to
(the subject.

newspaper publishers to send in

"Reports have been received," said
the commission In a statement, "to

ALL PROPOSALS NOW
President Wilson Will Be
Called Upon but Hands
Are Firmly Tied.
TKW YORK. Aug. 11. Whether
11 tho leaders of four hundred
thousand employes of the railroads of
the country will make good their
threat of a general strike unless their
iemands for an eight-hour day and
Mine and a half for overtime are
granted by the in in igvrs of rail
load rysteii s. probably will he known
tomoriow, it was learned 'lre tonight
from an authoritative source.
The only hope of a peaceful settle
ment apparently rested tuli'K't.t on the
pcasihility that Hie men ininht be in-
l ieed to a 'cept a new lorm of ai bi
lt::tn.n, although thus far tl.ey have
steadfastly refused all such propos
als. Their chief objection to arbi
trate n has been lack of representa
tion upon any of the hoards provided
miller existing statute.
The iti'-mbers of the federal board
of mediation and conciliation, while
declining to discuss tho situation, are
sa d to be hopeful that an expansion
af the sixc of the board provided for
under tho Newlands act may meet
this objection. Kffort 10 obtain from
Washington approval of this plan was
reported to have been responsible for
an apparent suspension of tho medi
ators' activities today.
Wilson Next.
If this suggestion is not accepted,
it was taid tonight, the mediation
board will have failed in its efforts
and the only recourse will be an ap
peal to President Wilson to me his
Influence to avert a strike. It was
pointed out, howPVer. that the presi
dent's powers will bs limited to sug
grrnlon and recommendation.
Leaders of tho brotherhoods have
declared that they would not consid
er arbitration under the Newlands
act, as It now stands. The railroads
have rejected the men's demands and
brve stood out firmly for arbitration.
Tho men have served notice that rath
er than arbitrate they will strike.
With both sides taking such an un
bending attitude there Is no solution
to the problem except the new arbi
tration plan, according to -a responsi
ble authority.
The principal feature of ihe new
plan Is said to be the formation of a
board of arbitration thet will give
each of the four brotherhoods a rep
resentative on the hoard while the ar
I Itrators of the railroads will be in
creased to an equal number, with four
neutral arbitrators, making a total
membership of 12.

Outlines Serum Cure.
NLW YORK, Aug. 11. Methods of
serum treatment in cases of Infantile
paralysis, based on scientific princi
ples and from which beneficial ru
suLLs have been obtained, were out
lined tonight by Dr. Haven Kmerson,
city health commissioner,
tine of these methods, tho commis
sioner stated, consists of using the
fluid withdrawn by spinal puncture
and reinjected subcutiineoiisly or
intra-musrulurly Into tho same pa
th nt. Another method Is spinal In
jections of blood serum derived from
persons who havo recovered from tho
disease.
The first treatment described by
tho commissioners as one of "activo
Immunization" Is based on the as
sumption that the spinal fluid taken
from the patient contains the virus
of the disease which, when injected
suncKiianeousiy or intra-miuieulariv.
will stimulate the production of ami-
bodies which will aid in overcoming
tho infection.
Delay 0mmiiu; Schools.
The blood serum derived from con
valescents, he pointed out, contains
anti-bodies which also will aid In
overcoming infection. The new high
record of 57 deaths today resulted
in a decision to postpone the opening
of the public schools set for Septem

The test is expected to come to

Kveti if the Ice companies should re
