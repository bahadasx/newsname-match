"In peace as in war," Sir Edward

such. Let all the allied governments
declare forthwith to the German peo
ple: Even w hen we shall have signed
peace we shall not send any diplo

Germany in our capitals, as long as
you Germans shall not have your

"Neutral powers have passively
looked on at the violation of customs
of law established by all nations. They
have been powerless or unwilling to
protest. If then a special penalty does
not show clearly that these laws can
not be transgressed, that these usu
ages cannot bo violated with impunity,
we must renounce in future all hope
of introducing into war rules of hu

DEBATE ON NEW PLAN
Another Form of Arbitration
Last Hope of Managers
May Close Roads.
Washington, Aug. 12. President
Wilson today had canceled his
usual week-end cruise down the
Potomac on account of the grow ing
seriousness of the railroad strike
situation.
The president was ready, a a
final resort, to deal direct with the
employes and Uic railway man
agements. President Wilson sent word today to
the mediators attempting to 6ettle the
threatened railroad strike that he
would like to consult with represen
tatives of both sides before there Is a
break.
The president was in communication,
by telephone with the federal media
tors and asked that he be informed if
a strike became imminent. Up to 1
o'clock he had not received v,'ord that
the situation was hopeless.
New York, Aug. 12. A settlement
of the differences between the man
agers of 225 railroads and their 400,000 -employes
through mediation has failed,
but the mediators today proposed to
the brotherhoods a new form of arbi
tration which, shortly.after 11 o'clock,
brotherhood chiefs and delegates be
gan to consider in executive session.
Strike Hinges on Acceptance.
Upon the decision of the employes as
to whether this form of arbitration will
be accepted depends the question of
calling a nation-wide railroad strike.
If the proposal is refused the only
chance of preventing a strike lies in aa
appeal to President Wilson.
Announcement of the failure of me
diation was made by Martin A. Knapp,
a member of the mediation board, after
a conferenc e of the mediators with the
brotherhood chiefs and delegates. The
precise terms of the new arbitration
proposal were not made public but the
proposal is understood to involve an
enlargement of the arbitration board
provided for under the Newlands act
to 12 members.
3Ien Reject Proposal, Report.
Although at 12:15 o'clock the meet
ing was not adjourned, a delegate
emerging from the hall said unoffic
ially that the men had voted to reject
the proposal for arbitration and to lay
their case before the president.
No decision was reached today by
the representatives of the brother
hoods of railway employes on the
question of accepting a proposal of ar
bitration. They will give their answer
to the United States board of media
tion and conciliation tomorrow morn
ing. The brotherhoods, after discussing
the arbitration proposal made to them
by the board under the Newlands act,
adjourned without reaching a decision
They announced that an answer would
be given tomorrow at another meeting
of the chiefs and delegates of the
brotherhoods.
A. B Garretson, head of the con
ductors' brotherhood, said after the
meeting that the mediation board had
not informed the men whether the
railroad managers had any specific
questions to arbitrate and that they
would propose that the mediators ob
tain from the managers a more defi
nite proposition.
Mr. Garretson described as "prema
ture" a statement made by a delegate
who left the meeting before it ad
journed that the men had rejected the
arbitration proposal and voted to lay
the situation before President Wilson.
He said, however, that the sentiment
of the men was still opposed to arbi
tration. The railroad managers reiterate
their determination to tight for the ar
bitration principle.
Incited to Washington.
President Garretson of the Order
of Railroad Conductors announced
this afternoon that ho had received
a personal invitation from President
Wilson to go to Washington immedi
ately for the purpose of discussing the
strike situation.
Mr. Garretson said he would re
spond to the invitation, but declined
to say when he would go.
Workers Appeal to Wilson.
Washington. Aug. 12. A petition
signed by f.,000 employes of tho Nash
ville, Chattanooga and St. Louts rail
way, not members of the great broth- .
erhoods, was presented to the prest- i
dent today asking congress to pass '
legislation protecting unorganized em-!
ployes against a tleup which would re- i
suit from a strike of the brother-1
hoods' members.
U. T. Frailer of Nashville, Tenn.,
who took the petition to the White
house said more additional petitions
from unorganized employes of many
more railroads would be sunt to the
president. .
