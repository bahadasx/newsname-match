Plan Put Up to Agents- of'Big Four
by Federal Board, but No
Definite Answer Is
President Wilson has sent word to representatives of trie railroads
laf of the four brotherhoods who threaten to strike, stating that before
lay tike any final action that would result in paralyzing traffic, he
Wtt to talk with them.
f'Tfc ppistaent wu in communication by telephone with the Federal
iikMlaters and asked that he be Informed it a strike became imminent
The President Informed the mediators that a strike must be avoided.
The message from the President was received while the representatives
at the 400,000 railroad employees wore In session here discussing what
action ther would take on the suggestion of the Federal Doard of Media
tion that the situation bo left to arbitration.
The efforts of tho mediators have
apparently failed. At a conference
thia morning with the 600 representa
tire of the "Dig Four" In Webster
Hall the arbitration plan was pre
anted. Later the arcnt.i of the mm
went into secret session to consid
er M.
After this conference A. D. Oarret
eon, leader of the conductors and the
spokesman for the brotherhoods, said:
"The statement that wo are going
to appeal directly to tho I'rosldcnt for
a solution of our differences Is wholly
premature, but I'll not say that wo
halt not do so.
"This Is the exact situation to-day:
The mediators came to us, admitted
that mediation had failed and then
Ufgested that the entire dispute bo
arbitrated. The publlo should keep
In mind that arbitration Is the second
movement In connection with tho
ffewlands Act. First there Is media
tion, and then, If that fall, the logical
tap Is trying to Induce both sides to
agree to arbitration.
"That Is exactly whnt the Board of
Mediation Is trying to do. Wo havo
not formally rejected Its appeal for
arbitration to-day, but have decided
to hold another meeting to-morrow.
By noon, then, wo shall give tho me
diators our formal reply."
"What will that reply be?" ho was
asked.
"Bearch me!" he replied succinctly.
Then he was asked why ono of tho
, Chairmen of tho employers had an
announcod that arbitration had been
formally rejected.
"Any such statement Is premature
ta all I can say," was the answer.
1 DELEGATION MAY BE SENT TO
PRESIDENT.
One of the reasons for calllnt? tho
extra meeting of the men to-morrow
was, It was learned, that a split has
occurred nmnng tho 600 chairmen.
More than half of these chairmen, It
was stated, were In favor of rejecting
arbitration forthwith and appealing
directly to President Wilson by send
ing Chiefs Stone, (larrrtson, Carter
ana awn in nnin'".
On the other h.uul, tho radical cle
mcnt Is opposed to anything but the
immediate declaration of a strike. It
la hoped at tho meeting to-morrow
to asslmllato these factions' and send
the delegation to tho Whlto House.
Ono of tho chiefs was asked what
procedure, would be followed by tho
brotho'rhoodu In case, it was deter
mined to drclaro a general strike.
He replied)
"We would call a general strlkn, giv
ing the railroads twenty-four noun.'

While experts are unable to deter
