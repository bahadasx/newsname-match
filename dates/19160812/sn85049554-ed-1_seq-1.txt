Negotiations Under Way
in United States For

MONEY NEEDED TO

^Proposed Loan of $250,000,000 Would
Find Its Way Back Into Treasuries of
American Manufacturer*—To Be Dis
tributed to Banks and Public in Way
of Debenture Notes—American Ship*
pers' Complaints Being Pressed.
New York, Aug. 12.—Expectation
was expressed in financial circles to
day that within a fortnight official
announcement would be made that
negotiations had been made for a new
loan, reported to be $250,000,000, to
Great Britain. This loan would run
for two years, with interest at 5 per
cent, and the notes to mature in two
years and to be offered at 99, would
be obligations of the American For
eign Securities Company, which ad
vanced $100,000,000 to France recently,
or of a new corporation with which
the same interests would be identified.
Securities for the loan, it is report
ed, would Include deposits of about
$300,000,000 of Canadian, Argentina
and ••Swiss government bonds, stocks
and bonds of American industrial and
railroad corporations and principal
and Interest would be payable in gold
in New York.
As in the case of the French loan
this new loan would be distributed
to banks and the public by debenture
notes.
The main purpose of such a loan Is
said to be to provide for munitions
purchased in the Unitea States.
Shippers Pressing Complaints.
London, Aug.- 12.—Complaints of
American shippers over detention of
consignments to the Netherlands
Overseas Trust are being supported
and pressed by the American govern
ment. American claimants all declin
ed to be bound by a clause in the
British government's agreement with
the trust by which Great Britain re
serves the right to detain any con
signment until reasonable doubt of
its destination has been satisfied.
The shippers take this attitude on
.tho ground that, they are n»t cou
tractural parties to such an agree
ment! but have acted solely (Ton the
promise of the foreign office that
American consignments to the trust
would be regarded as proof that the
goods wer« destined for consumption
In Holland. This contention has not
yet been directly met by the British
government.
Relief Work Blocked.
Washington, Aug. 12.—The uncom
promising attitude of Europenn bel
ligerents in the negotiations thru
which the ^United States had hoped
to extend relief work In the war zone
is causing keen disappointment among
officials here. Three new notes were
before the state department today but
none opened a new avenue to furnish
relief.
Great Britain and Austria have
again declared in vigorous terms
their unwillingness to recede from the
regulations which have operated to
exclude American relief supplies from
Poland and Serbia.
Turkey, in a note refusing to per
mit a neutral commission to under
take to feed and clothe war suffer
ers In Syria, apparently has endeavor
ed to forestall any further humani
tarian efforts in that quarter.

pioneer surgery in cases of appendi
citis, later in the treatment of other
intestinal disorders and more recently

matic apd other Joint troubles had
made him known all over the world.
Dr. Murphy had been Indisposed

overworked during the winter. When
hot weather struck Chicago several
weeks ago. Dr. Murphy and his wife,
who is a society leader in Chicago,

Knspp Admits Failure,
Announcement of the failure of
mediation was made by Martin A*
Knapp, a member of the mediation
board, after a oonferenoe of the medi
ators with the brotherhood chiefs and
delegates, which lasted more tban an
hour.
The precise terms of the new arbi
tration proposal were not made pub
lic, but it is known that the arbitra
tion board proposed would consist of
twelve members.
"We camu to the men," sgfd Mr.
Knapp, "with our belief that after sev
eral days of discussion there was no
prospect of arriving at a settlement by
mediation. Wo therefore put up to the
men a proposal of arbitration."
Opposed to Nowlanda Plan.
Leaders of the brotherhoods have
declared that they would not consider
arbitration under the Newlands act, as
it now stands. The railroads have re
jected the men's demands and have
stood out ttrmly for arbitration. The
men have served notice that rather
than arbitrate they will strike. With
both sides taking such an unbending
attitude there is no solution to the
problem except the new arbitration
plan, according to a responsible au
thority.
The principal feature of the new
plan is said to be the formation of a
board of arbitration that will give
each of the four brotherhoods a rep
resentative on the board, while the ar
bitrators of the railroads will be in
creased to an equal number, with tour
neutral arbitrators, making a total
membership of twelve.

aditlonal petitions from unorganised
members would be sent to the presi
dent in the near future.
