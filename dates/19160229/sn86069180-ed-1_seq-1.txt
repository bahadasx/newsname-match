the natural development of our

the succeeding generations, could
have no other logical result. In the

In the past havo learned thinkers
and acute observers already pointed
to these facts and urged the need
of a vital remedy in the cessation
of such education. A number of
years ago a popular magazine ar

Ages." showed what was being
taught in our colleges and univer
sities and what the results of such
teaqhlngs would be. In his famous
novel, "Tho Disciple," the great
Paul Bourget has shown how the

the position of tho Department of
Justice In regard to prosecution of
Thomas E. Watson, tho Georgia ed

Georgia members of Congress
against reported plans of the depart

Georgia on the ground that a fair

The Attorney General makes it plain
that he will not hesitate to institute

question was ot vital urgency to ev

tho spring a great Increase will tako

tho nation with more than double

to get together and fight the com
mon enemy before Teddy captured
the Republican nomination and con
vention. Several students of the
political game doubted this and
couldn't see the Rough Rider's
chances with a microscope. It Is
hardly unnecesary to add that all
or this has come to pass and the
conviction Is growing daily that If
Roosevelt has any opposition for tho
Republican nomination in tho con
vention it will be In a sort of a
half-hearted way and not worthy of
mention. Shortly after this predic
tion was made a well known and
sagacious political leader of this
city made the prediction that the
German-Americans would veer
around to support of Wilson, and
especially so If Roosevelt was to be
his opponent, as tho latter went a
great deal out of his way to want
only insult the Germans and German-Americans.
This prediction
has also been verified, as events of
the past week have shown, many
Gorman-American leaders In the
East rallying to tho support of
Wilson, and in a general election
this means much, as that vote has
always, been identified with the Re
publican party, especially in the
North and West.
People throughout the State,
regardless of political affiliations,
are utterly disgusted with the dally
routino of the Legislature upon tho
liquor question, and for which tho
responsibility rests upon a llttlo set
of political preachers and fanatical
grafters. It was hoped ero this
that Gov. Stanley would lend his aid
to putting a quietus on this ques
tion and many are a little disap
pointed that ho has muddled tho
waters by attempting to force a
substitute bill through, which in
every lino is foreign to tho prin
ciples of Democracy and Democratic
doctrine. It has been hinted at that
It Is aimed at Louisville especially,
tho principal purpose of which Is
to place the Democratic machinery
in tho hands of men in Louisville
whose only claim to recognition is
that they were for Stanley orig
inally. Now bear In mind, this
class wero for Stanley originally,
but never mado a showing in either
the primary or general election, and
if It wasn't for tho regular Demo
cratic organization in November it
would have been Gov. Morrow today
Instead of Stanley. If given con
trol they would bo powerless In an
election, their reign being Injurious
to the party in both city and State.
Thero are many well wishers for
Gov. Stanley and his administration
here and It is hoped that ho will
reconsider and turn a deaf ear to
these petty politicians who have no
following or prestige. In so doing
he will be serving his party and en
trenching himself In the good
graces of tho real Democratic work
ers. It is tho custom In the racing
game to mako nominations a long
way ahead for tho big stake races,
the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky
Oaks, Douglas Handicap, etc, and
the same pretty nearly applies to
the political game, the Kentucky
Irish American having compiled the
following list of possible starters in
the big stake races of next year,
some only through rumors, while
Dissensions have broken out In
tbj ranks of bigotry. A movement
is on foot to dopose three men who
have been shaping the destinies of
the "patriotic orders." A circular
aas been sent out from ifnnnnc ru.
calling on tho membership for drastic
action. It sets forth that very quietly
delegates wer0 chosen who met on
a certain day In a certain city to in
quire Into the status of the order
and discovered that the organization
was rotten to the core. Ti.io os

Tho following recommendations
are made: Call a convention this

Reformed Episcopal church and a
lawyer from Albany, N. Y. Tho
Grand Master and Reformed Episco
pal minister who holds the office
of Grand Recorder have appointed
themselves to their own positions
until 1917. These are the men who
cry our for American Ideals, and
they violate tho very principle of
American democracy by appointing
themselves absolute rulers until
1917. In tho case of the lawyer
from Albany we find that as chief
organizer of tho order he draws a
salary of ?15,000 per year and
tlueatens repeatedly that if he does
not have his own way he will return
to Albany and expose the other two.
All other orders wero to tako second

Liberty, the Junior Order of United
American Mechanics, tho Knights of
Luther, the Knights of Malta, tho
Patriotic Order of the Sons of Amer
ica and the Orangemen were con

portance, and wherever possible any
or all of these were to bo ruined and
absorbed into the sccrot order. . . .

the order iri Buffalo, Rochester and
other places In New York State and
In Chicago, 111. Ho took money from
tho newly-Initiated members and left
them and never sent a ritual or any

gives warning that tho power that
made it can unmake it, with this
