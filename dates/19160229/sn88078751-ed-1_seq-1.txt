BLOWN UP BY
FLOATING
British Passenoer
English Channel
Two Other Smaller Vessels Also
Victims Of The Mines
London, Feb. 28. The palatia! pas
senger liner Maloja of the Peninsular
and Oriental Hue was struck by a
floating mini Sunday forenoon when
midway between Dover and Folke
Btono, and panic within thirty minutes
after nor afterpart had boon blown up
la a terrific explosion. Thoro were
119 passengers and a crow of about
S00 on board. Almost all of the pas
sengers wcro reported saved.
At a lalo uour It was estimated that
147 persons were drowned or killed as
a result of the accident, 117 of whom
wcro seamen.
No Americans are believed to have
been aboard. The mine which caused
tho Maloja's destruction is believed
to have been one of the large nets
spread by the British navy for the
protection of England's coast agaiiwt
Gorman naval raiders.
While helping in tho rescue work
tho British steamship Empress of Fort
William, of 1,383 tons gross, herself
struck a mino within half a mile of
the sinking Maloja and Immediately
began to settle "nor stern and fore
rart. She kept abovo tho water long
enough to enable the crew to take to
the boats, then suddenly exploded and
disappeared in a cloud of steam.
A third victim of a ,mine was tho
Dutch mail boat Mecklenburg. Pas
eengers and crew were saved by two
Dutch steamships. In consequence of
tho Mecklenburg's sinking the ser
vice between Holland and England
was stopped.
The Mnlojn, one of tho most stately
liners in tho British passenger ser
vice, was bound from London to Bom
bay. She was the sister ship o! the
Forsia, which was sunk from a thus
far unknown cause oft tho Island of
Croto on Dec. 30, with the Ws of 330
persons out of 450 on board. Among
those lost with the Persia was the
American consul to Adon, Robert N.
McNeely.
Second Steamer Explodes.
A largo number of mail sacks weo
lost with tho Maloja. Tho rescuo of
tho majority of tho paBsengeni Is
nsoribed by tho Peninsular and Ori
ental lino to tho fact that only Satur
day evonlng the Maloja's captain had
Instructed tho passengers In tho uso
of lifo belts. Tho behavior of both
passentrers and crew is characterized
In an nfllclal statement of tho line as
splendid."
Tho oxnloslon which followed tuO
Maloja's collision with tho mine was
tho bW for Innumerable large and
small crift to hurr to her assistanco.,
Within a few minutes tho sinking ves
sol was surrounded by a swarm of
steamships, trawlers, tu?s, lighters,
boats, and oven small warships.

MN
Liner Lost In The
There was a stormy sea, however,
and the rescue work wan made under
difficult circumstances. These were
Tendered still worso by the sudden ex
plosion on tho Empress of Fort Wil
liam, which divided the rescue ves
sels and added greatly to tho dram
ctlc element of the situation. A re
markable feature is the assertion that
there was no panic. Tho simultaneous
sinking of tho two vessels, both de
stroyed by a mine, with hundreds of
men and women in tho water strug
glfng for their lives, offered one of
tho most spectacular scenes over wit
nessed off Dover.
The ' Peninsular and Oriental lino
statement, after telling of tho cause,
time and scene of tho disaster, said:
"The after part of the ship was blown
up. There was a high sea and the
captain seeing that extensive damage
had been done tried to bench tJO
l'nor, but was unsuccessful In this,
tho engine room being full of water.
The vessel sank in! about half un hour.
The survivors were landed at Dover.'
The Maloja sank about two miles
oft shore. Tho explosion was heard
and seen at Dover and tugs and mo
tor boats raced promptly to her aid.
Patrol boats also responded speedily
n the Maloja's distress calls.

BATTLE AT VERDUN CONTIfiUES
Berlin Announces the Capture of
Champneuville and the Cote de
Talou Attack Begun On Verdun
From the East as Well as the
North Review of Operations, On
Other Battle Fronts.
London. Feb. 28. The German as
sault on Verdun slackened somewhat
in intensity over most ot the line,
which now lies directly under the
guns of tho forts. Narrowing their
most desperate attacks to the short
fiont between the Douaumont heights
end the plateau north of the village o:
Vaux, to the east, the Germans here
concentrated their efforts in a strong
attack. Fort Douaumont is still occu
pied by small German forces. The
French are closing in on this position
on three sides and announce that the
German force Is maintaining Itself In
the position only with difficulty,
Tho very unfavorable weather con
ditions, with a beavy fall of snow,
may be one reason for the lessening
of the force of tho German attack;
the dispatches from the front indicate
that heavy losses may have had an
effect.
Five separate attacks have been
made by the French on Tort Doua
mont in an effort to retake the posi
tion, the German war office says. Each
attack was made by fresh troops, but
all five were repulsed with heavy
losses to the French forces. The num
ber of unwounded French prisoners
taken In the seven days of the battle,
the Berlin statement says, has reach
ed 15.0Q.Q,. .
French Withdrew.
Finding tho position untenable bo
cause of the fire of both artilleries,
tho French have evacuated the Cote
de Talou; to the west of Douaumont
and the position is now unoccupied,
the French say, by either side.
In the official statement received
from Berlin, the German war office
announces that the Germans pressing
phead to the west of Douaumont have
reached Nave, on the southern bor
der of the wooded district northeast
of Bras, taking Champneuville and
the Cote de Talou on the way. To
the east of Douaumont the Germans
announce the storming of extended
fortified works at Haraumont.
The Germans have begun an attack
also on Verdun from the east, as well
ts from the north, throwing sufficient
forces against the French line In tho
region of Moranvllle and Blanzee. on
the Woevre plain, to force the French
advanced posts to fall back, Tho Ger
mans followed up the attack in an ef
fort to reach Hill 255. These attempts
were checked.
There has been considerable activ
ity along the Russian front around
Riga, Friedrichstadt and Illoiikst.
In the Caucasus region, despite the
heavy snow, which at places is breast
deep, the Russians are continuing vig-
ously their pursuit of the Turks.

Captain GargiU's men outside. All
but live of the latter perished and the

Roumanla to Remain Neutral.
London, Feb. 28. The chances of

war on either side exist no longer,
according to leaders of the responsi
ble Roumanian parties. Roumanla

REPLY REACHES WASHINGTON
Eubmarine Campaign Against Armed
Merchantmen Vill Begin the First

Likely of Quetlon of Distinction
Between Ships Armed For Defense
and Those Armed For Offense.
Offense.
Washington, Feb. 28. Count Von
Bernstorff received from his govern
ment an outline of Germany's posi
tion regarding her announced Inten
tion of torpedoing all armed enemy
ships without warning after Feb. 29.
This outline will be presented to Sec
retary of State Lansing without do
lay. As hitherto forecasted, the memor
andum received may open the way
for a discussion of the whole question
of the distinction between merchant
ship3 armed for defense and those
armed for offense, but contrary to ex
pectations of the state department
and the embassy, the communication
docs not further discuss the operation
of the new submarine campaign pend
ing this discussion. The campaign will
begin us scheduled on March 1.
In the memorandum Just received
at tho German embassy the Berlin
foreign office directs Ambassador
Bernstorff to inform the American
fiovernment that Germany Is prepared
to stand by lier past assurances and
does not regard her coming campaign
c gainst armed enemy craft as nullify
ing these assurances.
The attention of the American gov
ernment is called to Germany's un
derstanding that the Lusitanla con
troversy in. no way dealt with armed
liners; that the first American note
on the Lusitanla case, dated May 13.
1915, specifically referred to the ship
as being "unarmed."
To Submit Evidence.
In support of the German conten
tion that the character of armament
en merchant vessels does not Insure
its use merely for defense. Ambassa
dor Bernstorff Is directed to lay be
fore Secretary Lansing two sets of
evidence. The first includes alleged
circumstances in about tweny-flve
cases investigated by the German au
thorities showing where enemy mer
rhantmen have used their armament
to attack German submarines and
ether German war craft on sight or
after warning had been given the
merchantmen to haul to nnd submit
to visit and search.
The second batch of evidence whkh
the ambacsador is directed to lay be
fore Mr. Lansing contains the copy
of the British secret orders and sup
plementary Instructions alleged by
Germany to have been Issued recent y
lo all armed Br'Msh merchantmen to
uso their defensive armament orte.i
slvcly asra'nst German and Austrian
submarines.
Athnngh the instructions show that
Gercfiv Is unalterably opposed to
any rustHctlons of her new subma
rine campaign, It Is understood they
are sufficiently broad to enable Am
I bassador Bernstorff to suggest to Mr.
Lansing that Germany might modify
her new campaign if the entente pow
' ers would give solemn guarantees to
the United States that the defensive
rrmamont on their ships would never
be used offensively. Meantime Count
Von Bernstorff is directed, it is said,
to urge upon the United States the
advisability ot warning Americans to
Veep off armed merchantmen of the
