was done to give them as good a re
ception as possible.
"Whilo our Infantry, oa the firing
of the wood held off the enemy, a
lieutenant of engineers and his men

Review of" War Situation.
The German drive against Verdun
is now being exerted in greatest force
from the east where the attacking
armies have advanced on the plain of
the Woevre and reached the base of
the heights east of Meuse at several
ponis. J
Berlin today reported new advances
in this region along a front approxi
mately 20 miles long, stretching from
Dieppe, seven miles northeast of Ver
dun, to Champton, 13 miles southeast
of Verdun. The statement announces
Vin Mntiim M" Af nnVinnI1; nml f!ham.Ti-
ton and says Abaucourt on the high
road from Verdun to Metz and also
the town of Blanzee have been pass
ed. Paris admits the German capture of
Manhoulles but declares a counter at
tack brought the French back to the
western boundary of the village which
they jiold under fJre...,',
The only German clnlra to advance
north of Verdun is the capture of a
small armored work northwest of
Douaumont. Paris nsserts attacks in
the Douaumont -region were repulsed
The German announcement shows
the taking In the Verdun battles of
nearly 17,000 prisoners.
What may mean a renewal of the
German drive on Verdun in terrific
forec is confined in the announcement
from Paris today that the bombard
ment north of tho fortress is assum
ing greater intensity.
In the Woevre district, south of the
fortress, tho Germans captured the
village of Manhoulles. Tho French
declare that In a counter attack they
attained the western boundary of
tho village which theynow hold under
their fire.
As a whole the German attack,
while still continuing, has apparently
less driving power while tho pressure
Is being shifted from point to point.
Military observers say that tho
thrusts now being made here and
there are for the purpose of picking
out the weakest spot in-the extended
line.
Meanwhile the French are deliver-
ing vigorous cuuntui duuo. ..-.
attacked the positions they now occu
py are holding firmer.
Germans Strongly Reinforced.
Estimates aro now made that there
are 750.000 German troops engaged In
the Verdun fighting, strong reinforce
ments having been sent to the front.
Advices -from Petrograd declare that
the Turkish forces are hastily evacuat
ing Trebizond and nearby towns on
the Black sea.
Casualties of the British forces in
tho various fighting areas published
during Februnry totalled 739 officers
and 17,847 men. This was somewhat
smaller than during January.
Berlin advices, at hand today de
clare that Germany's new rule of sub
marine warfare, under which armed
merchantmen will bo treated as war
ships, will be put into effect at mid
night tonight as originally announced.

Germans Bring Up 250,00Q
More Men and Deliver
Bludgeon Strokes.
FIGHT IS DESCRIBED
Veteran Sees Fearful Sights
Air Pressure in Bombard
ment Causes Blood to
Burst From Ears.
Paris, Feb. 29, 5.45 a. m. Military
critics express the opinion that the
German forces, which at the begin
ning of the battle around Verdun num
bered probably a half million, now ex
ceed 750,000.
"Tho situation is now decidedly
better' is the phrase commonly used
this morning In, the Paris press re
garding the struggle for the great
French stronghold. The French aro
beginning to react vigorously against
the German "bludgeon strokes." which
are having less and less effect and
are being delivered with diminished
energy. It is expected, however, that
they will he renewed again today, but
at new points. The -fact that the bat
tle is shifting Is taken as a sign that
the German general staff has begun to
despair of maintaining a real impres
sion on tho French.
"1 fought sin'ceth.e beginning of the
war " says a soldier who has returned
to Paris and who was present at the
fighting at Ornos. "I saw the sham
bles at Suippes and Souain. They
were nothing-to what I saw last

retired undor orders, but we killed
them by the dozen 1$ was so terrible

Germans Mowed Down.
"As their battalions advanced upon
us, they were In serried masses, by
files of twenty. The shrapnel from
our 75 millimeter guns and the pro
jectiles from our .'artillery foil among
them and you could see the great gaps
as if a mower bad passed with a
scythe Then hlh explosive shells
which burst on contact, fell and limbs
shot into the air. We .were so close
that pieces of their torn flesh fell
among us. Eventually we reached
Moncourt and took shelter for a time
in a wood. Although It was three
o'clock in the morning the bursting
shells made it clear as day, giving" the
battlefield the aspect of a -fairy scene
Machine Guns' Deadly Work.
"From behind us tho French artil
lery fired into tho German masses, the
German shells flying over our heads
toward the Douaumont seqtion. Then
our machine guns, placed in batteries ,
every five yards, began to play and
wo saw the dead in groups upright
where there was not room .to fall
From Moncourt I followed the supply
road to Fleurv. where T took the llcht
railway toward Verdun. The heavy
guns near Douaumont and Damloup
were firing as faBtras'thoy could be
loaded. When we passed between the
two points the air pressure produced
by the continuous discharges, was so
terrific that blood rushed from our
ears and our lungs almost ceased
working." '
French Soldier's Story.
Paris, Feb. 29, 6 30 a. m. A. com
batant, who was in one of the most
advanced trenches early In the battle
of Verdun and who has returned to
Paris wounded, gave his experience
ns follows
"At dawn we received oidors to
leave the treiich and to retire to a
strong position in the Vaux woods, in
front of Douaumont. Bending low we
rotirod the four or five kilometers
through the snow without much loss.
Once in the new trenches we could
not hear one another speak so great
was the noise of tho cannonading
and when wo looked through tho perl
scopes we could only see heavy clouds
of smoke shutting out the sky, with
jets of flro flashing" through the
snow flakes. There were about a doz
en of us In tho trench and we felt
the suppressed emotion so much that
at last we all burst out singing and
yet none of us could hear a fcord
spoken even by himself.
Germans Arrive En Masse.
"Th(i we saw tho Germans coming
on. They were in such masses that
they looked like a flock of sheep.
When our guus began t speak, white
empty spaces fahowed among the gray
of tho advancing masses, but they
were soon filled up by fresh patches
of gray. As they neared our barbed
wire our machine guns opened fire
and we had to cover our ears with
anything that came handy, the noise
was so tremendous. I felt no fear,
but I had no feelings or thoughts,
only a sort of buzzing and vertigo
When the night came on and the
flares lighted up the field, the Ger
mans Boemod to be quite close, but
it was an optical illusion. They ad
vanced bravely waving their rifles,
or leaping aa they passed over the
heaps of dead. I -as Knocked over

No Time Should Be Lost in

Greater, Than Great
Britain's.
IRRITATING POLICIES
U. S. Must Defend Monroe
Doctrine and Control Canal,
Maintain Open Door and
Enforce Exclusion.
Washington, Feb. 29. The United
Slates is maintaining more policies ir
ritating to other countries than any
other nation in the world, Rear Ad
miral Knight, president of the navy
war college, told the house naval com
mittee today, in support of his recom
mendation that no time be lost in
building the strongest navy in the
world, To defend the Monroe doctrine
and control the Panama canal; main
tain an open door in China and en
forco Asiatic exclusion, he said the
fleet should be equal to, or greater,
than Great Britain's.
Other world events, the admiral de
clared, made it seem probable that at
th. close of the European war various
foreign powers, believing' that those
American policies conflict with their
interests, might declare they would
no longer accept them.
Admiral Knight's statements were
drawn out by Representative Calla
way, who insisted he could see no
danger to justify a race for naval su
premacy. United States Menaced.
"Are we in any way menaced!", he
'dem aiifled.-- " --'''" ""'- -
"In my opinion we are," said Admir
al Knight.
"How?"
"I wish to be excused from answer
ing this question."
"I would like to find somebody who
would answer it" said Representative
Callaway. 'Is the date of 1925 set for
completing this great fleet, the date
when this thing will break?"
"I don't believe it will break at all
if we prepare now" said the admiral.
Strength of Fleet Outlined.
To equal the British fleet by 1925.
Admiral Knight said, twenty dread
noughts, fifteen battle cruisers, twenty
scout cruisers, seventy-five submar
ines and seventy-five destroyers would
have to be added to the present fleet.
He thought Grfat Britain would not
regard an American building program
as directed against her.
The present navy, ho said, should
be eliminated In considering the possi
bilities of any attack on the Now Eng
land coast becfiuso It lacks scouts
and might easily bo drawn far south
ward by a foint, while the real attack
was made. For that reason, he said,
he wished to see at least nine battle
cruisers and eight scouts laid down
this year. (

NEW RULE TO BE
PUT IN EFFECT
Armed Merchantmen Will
Positively Be Sunk by Ger
man Submarines With
out Warning.
WILL HALT NO VESSELS
No Assistance Expected From
Washington in Ending Dis
puted Situation Wil-
son "Letter Convincing.
Berlin, Feb. 2S, 4 p. m., via Lon
don, Feb. 29, 12:10 p. m. The Asso
ciated Press Is informed by i Ger
many's leading statesmen that the
new rule of submarine warfare which
was announced in the German memo
randum regarding the future treat
ment of armed merchantmen, will
positively be put into effect at mid
night of tomorrow, Tuesday, Febru
ary 29.
At that time the heretofore warn
ing for neutrals, giving them oppor
tunity to advise neutrals not to travel
on armed merchantmen, will expire.
For several days there has been
more than a possibility that Germany
at the last moment might make a pro
posal that she would discontinue prac-
liv.-us oi repri&ai una sinn no mercuanu
ships, freighters or passenger lines,
without first halting the vessels for
examination and putting the crew in a
place of safety as in the old style of
naval war, if the allies would remove
armament from merchantmen. It was
thought England might accept this
propoBaJ, or-othat tlie United. States
and other 'neutrals would be " con
vinced, if England refused, that she
had no intention of discontinuing the
use of armament for offensive pur
poses. This might possibly have given
President Wilbon proof that arma
ment on merchantmen was not used
purely for defense and thus enable the
pesident to reconcile the two con
flicting viewpoints regarding tho im
propriety of merchantmen carrying
armament and the impossibility ot
the United States altering the estab
lished law of nations.
No Assistance From U. S.
Publication of President Wilson's
letter to Senator Stone, however, ap
parently convinced Germany's lead
ing statesmen that no assistance was
to be expected from Washington In
ending tho present anomalous situa
tion regarding rules of submarine war
fare and that it was useless to make
proposals, the only result of which
would be to give England more time
to replenish her stores while a dls
cussibn was in progress at Washing
ton and Loudon. At least two of the
higheBt officials directly concerned
appear to be now convinced that
Washington had no desire to em
barrass Great Britain in the conduct
of the war or to do anything which
might permit Germany to use the
submarine in warfare against com
merce. Spectacular Warfare Expected.
Newspapers and the German public
generally are primed for a spectacu
lar opening of the now submarine
campaign. The readers of tho aver
age newspaper article or contribution
to the papers by a nnval expert
might expect to find the columns of
his newspaper on Thursday too small
to contain tho full account of the
merchantmen sunk by Germany's big
floet of submarines on the first day
of the campaign. It may be doubted,
however, whether the campaign will
set In' with such vigor and it would
be no surprise if some time passes
without incident of such a character
as to force the United States to act
ou President Wilson's declaration.
Wilson Will Not Change.
Such, at least, appears to be the
hope of the leading German states
men. They havo littlo expectation
that President Wilson will change hi?
attitude even after the receipt of the
Justificatory evidenco attached to the
German memorandum In the form of
'appendices which apparently were
not contained In the American em
bassy's cablegram giving the text of
I he memorandum itsolf, and is being
forwarded by mail. It is not believed
that Americans will be warned from
traveling on armed merchantmen or
that adequate measures will be taken
to see that armament is used only
for defensive purposes. German
statesmen apparently hope that by the
exercise of a oertain amount of cir
cumspection matters may drift along
for a time without conflict, that
Americans of their accord will avoid
steamships belonging to belligorents
and that in such incidents as do oc
cur it may be possible for Germany to
prove that the ships In question vio
lated the rules of warfare and acted
offensively.
Furthor than this their hopes do
not extend.

ENORMOUS SHIPMENTS H
War Demand, Failure of Corn H
Crop and Profits of Business H

Chicago, Feb. 29. A jump of io lfl
cents in the price of hogs sent the H
price to $8.90 a hundred pounds, the j
highest in sixteen'months. According H
to .veterans at the; local stockyards, j
"the whole country'? is going into hog fl
raising and more pork and "bacon is
being ertten today than ever before.1 fl
From the first of the year until H
yesterday, 2,155,000 hogs were re- M
ceived at the Chicago yards, accord- M
3ng to figures complied today. This M
Is an increase of more than half a jH
million head over the similar pqriod H
of 1915. For the eleven principal H
markets of the country the .total hog H
shipments from January 1,' 1916, to M
date is more than 7,100,000, as against M
5.700,000 for the same period in 1915. H
This, it is pointed out, Is in spite of H
the fact that the German lard market -
is closed. H
The extra demand for pork created
by the war, the spreading of the. M
knowledge of the profits ot hog rals- M
lng and the failure of last year's M
corn crop are the causes to which tho H
unusually heavy hog shipments ar M
attributed. H
