The Real Truth About It:
GRIFFITHS VOTED agalnit putting the dam where
It la, and acted according to th* advice of the en
pert*.
GRIFFITHS WAS NOT In the city council when the
question of e«t*ndlng the city light *y*tem to Tuk
will came Lp. He «ai chief of police under Gill at
the time.
GRIFFITHS TOOK the Job at chief temporarily, to
help Gill redeem t imself. There wa* no troubls of
any kind Griffith* tendered hi* rrngnstion on
July 1, but Gill aafced him to *tay till September,
than persuaded him to (tsy longer Griffith* re
• igned in November. 1914 GILL AT THAT TIME
PRAISED GRIFFITHS AND GAVE HIM CREDIT
FOR WHATEVER SUCCESS THE GILL AOMIN
ISTRATION HAD ENJOYED AT THAT TIME
GRIFFITHS MARRIED a school teacher, the daugh
ter of a poor homesteader in Nebraska.
GILL SAIO In public apsschts' "Griffiths dragged
his wlfs to th* Isvsl of a strset wslksr to gsln his
ambition.' - H* also assailed ths looks of another
woman. Hs msds ths false and unmanly Inalnua
tlon that there was a money bargain in ths mar
rlsgs of Mrs. Griffiths to Austin I. Griffiths.
* • -i. - «*-. .
COUNCILMAN MARVLK never made any such Im
possible prom lie, either written or verbal.
MARBLE WAS NOT A CANDIDATE WITH GILL
TWO YEARS AGO.
GRIFFITH* NEVER hired any men at SO cent* a
day. On the contrary, ha gave the Hotel Liberty
man the best contract they received In the winter
of 1914-101S, aa the manager, Henry Pauly, plainly
seta out fully, elsewhere In this Issue. Incidental
ly, Gill declared these Jobless men shouldn't get
even a cent a day.
GRIFFITHS HAS not been quoted In thla connection.
H* has not said anything about the Felix Crane
case The Star has commented on It editorially,
however, and stands by what It has aaid.
THERE NEVER were V) ret In the city. The
