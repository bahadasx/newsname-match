POLITICS A LIVE TOPIC IN THIS
STATE TODAY.
THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR
IS CESTEK OF IMEKEST.
TAKAOl S OTHER CANDIDATES
Stcial to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Feb. 28.?The county con- ,
ventions of the Democratic party are j
not far off, and they will be closely fol- ;
lowed by the May convention, which j
will be the real opening of the political
campaign of 1916.
As is usual at this time or tne year, (
biennially, in South Carolina, politics is
a live topic. The legislature has made j
its record, and ail the places in the
house, and half the places in the sen- j
\ate, are to be filled again this summer, i
The State officers and most of the;
county officers are to be nominated in \
the primary. There will not be a va-!
cancy in the United States senate, by j
expiration of term, until the term of j
Senator Tillman expires in March, 1916. j
and therefore unless there should be a j
vacancy from extraordinary cause, mcit >
will be no election for the United States j
senate in this State until the summer of j
1918, when Senator Tillman's successor
will be chosen.
A live issue in the May convention :
will be the county-to-county campaign j
plan. The present indication is that 1
there will be a strong effort to abolish !
the county-to-county plan. J
CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR.
The campaign for governor is the ccn?
;r,f0r?t now. it is, of course,
LIC KJL HUVivgb
taken for granted that Governor Man- j
ning \\411 be a candidate for a second I
term. Former Governor Blcase has an- j
Tiounced his candidacy, and has issued a I
statement, which was published in var- j
ious newspapers last week, announcing ?
the platform upon which lie will stand i1
for re-election to a third term as chief j
executive of the State.
Some several weeks ago Mr. Wm. A. j
Stuckey, of Bishopville, who is well
known in Newberry, having been superintendent
of the dewberry city
retired from, the pro
u??.
fession to devote himself exclusively to
his farming intersts in Lee county, was
ouoted to effect that he* will seriously
contemplating making-the race for
governor. Following the announcement
of Gov. Blease, the Columbia correspondent
of The News and Courier
?*ked Mr. Siuckey as to rumors tfiat
fie would be on the Blease ticket for
lieutenant governor. Prof. Stuckey emphatically
denied that he would be a
candidate for lieutenant governor, stat
1 j I
k ing that if he \yas in tiie race u wuuiu i
- l>e for the place of governor.
Dr. Olin Sawyer of Georgetown, who
is now mayor of that progressive little
city, has also been prominently mentioned
in this connection, and has not denied
the "soft impeachment.''
Both Prof. Stuckey arid Dr. Sawyer
are aligned with the Blease faction in ;
South Carolina politics.
There has been considerable speculation
as to whether Solicitor Cooper
would again be a candidate. Some of
the political prophets are predicting that
he will, and some predicting that he
will wait for two more years. Solicitor
Cooper has not yet made any announce- j
ment as to his plans, and it is hardly j
? probable that his status as to the race;
will be fixed until he sees fit to state it j
himself.
^ There was some talk around Columbia j
last week that Congressman James F.
Byrnes might be in the race for gov-ernor,
but Mr. Byrnes has issued a
statement from Washington to the effect
1
k that be will not be in the governor s i
A race, but will be a candidate to succeed
H himself in congress.
There is talk of Col. Alvin H. EtherW
edge of Saluda, who is well known in
Xewberry, being in the race for confess
against Mr. Byrnes. ,
The legislature having changed the j
liquor law again, after a vote by the j
people last September, it is not mipi unable
that the eternal liquor question will
ag^in play a part in the campaign.
CONGRESSIONAL RACE IN THIRD
DISTRICT.
Talking of congressional races, the
race in the Third district is one of the
most interesting. Among the opponents
L of Congressman Aiken for reelection is
' Col. Fred H. Dominick, the able assist- j
afit' geriral of" South ' Carolina/
*
\
nd Mr. Dominick's friends are conn
.exit of his success. He was in the ract j
wo years ago, and was in the second j
ace. with a very large vote. Congress- j
nan Aiken is a candidate for reelection.;
fie is an indefatigable campaigner, and j
has a strong following in the district, j
Among the other announced candidates !
~ TT ----- z"' r\t fIu' firppn- !
ss Air. n.em\ v. xiiuiiuu, cwv.
wood bar, a son of Senator B. R. Tillman.
There was some talk during tlie legisiaturc
that Mr. Junius :T. Liles, of
Orangeburg, chairman of the ways and
means committee of the house or represntatives,
would be a candidate for
lieutenant governor this summer, but |
ibis morning's news is to the effect that
Mr. Liles is laying his plans to run for
congress to succeed Congressman Lever,
in case Mr. Lever should be appointed
secretary of agriculture, if the present
secretary of agricukure is made secretary
of war by President Wilson, to succeed
Mr. Garrison, resigned?a somewhat
complicated conditional state of
affairs.
Mr. .J. Howard Moore, of Abbeville,
a member of the ler:-lature for the past
four years, who has been affiliated with
the "Blease side" in politics, is also
prominently spoken of as a candidate
for lieutenant governor, and it is not
improbable that he will he in the race.
FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.
Mr. Cecil C. Wyche. a former Newberry
boy, now practicing law in Spartanburg,
has announced his candidacy
for lieutenant governor. It is presumed
i' t lieutenant Governor Bethea will be
in the race to succeed himself.
Mr. Liles is one of the leaders of the
Manning administration forces. Mr.
Bethea is aligned on what is known as
1 t _
the "anti-Blease" side. Mr. Wvcne Delongs
to the "Blease faction." He represented
Spartanburg county in the legislature
during the session of IQ131914:
Attorney General Peeples will be a
candidate to succeed himself. He will '
probably be opposed for reelection by
Senator Josiah J. Evans of Marlboro
count}-, and there has been considerable
talk of Mr. Claude X. Sapp of Lancas"
Mr Rano was
tcr, being in uic i?v?- ^
a member of the 1913-14 legislature.
Senator A- F. Spigner, of Columbia,
and Representative E. Foster Brigham, :
of North Augusta, have also been 1
spoken of as probable candidates for at- 1
torney general. '
FOR RAILROAD COMMISSIONER.
Among the candidates mentioned for
railroad commissioner to succeed Mr.
McDuffie Hampton are Messrs. J. Cope 1
Massey of Lancaster county, and D. L. ;
Smith of Colleton county, both members
of the legislature, and both of
whom have stated tliat they have positively
made up their minds to run and J
will be in the race to the finish.
~ ir
Among others who are spoKen 01 m connection
with the race for railroad
commissioner are Representative Albert
S. Fant of Belton, Mr. James Cansler,
of Tirzah, arid Mr. IW. ;T. Thrower, of
N
Chesterfield.
Strong pressure has been directed
e the State towards in
irum uuuua.i>v/>.
. - .
ducmg 'Senator Jno. L. McLaunn, State
warehouse commissioner, to enter the 1
race f<jr governor. Writers of articles V
in the newspapers have urged him to
made the race, and it is known that he
has'received a great many letters from
practically every county in South Carolina
urging him to enter the campaign.
Senator McLaurin, however, has
given not the slightest intimation of
1- - - koan HfPVnf
being a candidate, nc lias ucvii -? .
ing his whole time and attention to tlic
upbuilding of the State warehouse system.
in an earnest effort to give relief
to the farmers of the State and of the
South from some of the burdens which
they have been laboring under. His
course will be guided by what he conceives
to be his highest duty to the
people of the State, viewed in the light
of the great trust which has been re- <
posed in him.

ATHLETICS IN NEWBERRY
COLLEGE SHOCLD HAVE HELP
(E>y request of Prof. Derrick).
The basketball team made another
successful trip last week winning all
rlirpp irrimcs n hived. Thev have played
12 games and won 12, and have one
more to play tonight.
The hardest of these games were
with Clinton and Wofford; both
were "battles royal," but when "the
smoke of the contest had blown away"
it was found that Newberry had the
big end of the score on each occasion.
The team is certainly "putting Newberry
on the map" this year, with a record
up to this time of 12 games played and
12 shames won.
The final game of the schedule will
1? ?? < Vou-Korrv iThac/Tov ni<rhfr

with Clinton. It promises to he the fastest
and hottest game we have ever had
in Newberry. The Clinton team is coming
down with the determination to
'even things* up." and they believe they
can do it. too. They certainly have a
fast, well-coached team of clear, ball
players. Hut Newberry expects to be
on hand at the "show down," and expects
to make it "13 straight." lAir. Van
\ etre of Columbia will referee.
The game will begin promptly at.7 130
on account of the Lyceum number at

jommodations for the crowd that will
attend the game. Mr. Win. J. Wicker
has generously given 500 feet of lumber
to provide more seats, and it is desired
to have these ready by that time.
i\V<e wish to commend Mr. Wicker'sj
generous example to our other friends '
in the city. The Athletic association of j
cbe college is in a precarious condition )
financially. In addition to having a j
teavy debt on hand, we are now facing
:he baseball season with no uniforms !
>r other equipment, and with no money
in sight to get them with. Then, too,!
< '
tne tence 01 ine auncui uciu j
to be repaired, and there will have to be 1
some work,done on the diamond.
Some years ago the people of New- I
berry would help our Athletic associaion
very generously every spring, but \
[his has not been done now for a num- J
ber of years?probably because they j
were not asked to. The opportunity to
give us this help is going to be afford-j
ed them this week. Committees have ,
been appointed, and it is the intention
us anything at all for this cause.
We believe that our friends in the
? 1 4-y-v fVlfC .
city win respond generous LVJ UJiO
peal. The college athletics are worth a
?ood deal to Newberry in the way of
advertisement; they help to "put Newberry
on the map/' There are a number
of towns of our class in this State J
that spend enough money every summr
for summer baseball to put us on
"Easy street" in every branch of college
athletics. In fact, Newberry herself did
that some summers ago.
College athletics add a good deal to
the lite of a town. Even those who I
"hemselves do not enjoy athletics will
have to admit that. But the type of athletics
that will he a credit to the town,
as well as to the college, costs money.
N'ow, Newberry, as a town, has a right
to be proud of the record that we have
made in recnt years; we believe she will
be glad to help us pay the cost>
The boys are optimistic with reference j
to the canvass we are going to make'
this week. They believe that many will
help us because they enjoy good, clean
college athletics; they believe others
will help us because, though they do
not car-1 for athletics, they do care for
the boy".

I read somewhere the other day in
some paper, where the editor was talking
about the city beautiful, which be?
-* - j l-? ? /-* ir f kn
ing lmerpreiea means uwi una is tut
time of the year to think about cleaning
up the city and making it attractive
and pleasant and healthful, and to do
it is to have a clean town. Wonder if
the civic association or the town authorities
have thought about this, and
If there are going to be any steps taken
looking to such a condition. It is just
like evrything else, if every one wiR do
his duty and sweep before his own door,
as it were, the thing is Hone. That is,
it cli/Milr? thr first rhitv'of every one
l<> take thought and heed oi his own
premises. But in this day of depending
upon the State and the government
to do evrything, I reckon the people
have the habit of waiting for the authorities
to take steps first, and sec to
it it-Jiat evry one looks after his own personal
welfare, and if he does not the
government will do it for him. At any
rate, it would not be a bad idea to take
a j little thought on these things, because
the government might forget to
lopk after them for you. Yes, a little
thought is a good thing. And that reminds
me that I read a little poem the
other day which is called "Alone." It
expresses what I am trying to impress.
There are unfortunately so many people
who do not think, that where there
is one he almost stands alone. That, no
doubt, sounds queer, but you just stop a
moment and think about it. If I can
make you think 1 wiii have accomplished
enough for this one time. But read
this:
A T
THere is a man in our town?a most peculiar
chap?
"Who never hopes to gain renown, or
feather for his cap.
Old timers say with tongues in cheeks
he's queer in many ways?
He always thinks before he speaks, ^nd
stands by what he says.
There is a man in our town?'tis rather
strange, I know?
Who causes hasty folks to frown and
think he's rather slow.
DU[ I <|IIJ LVl Lctxii yj i in; iuvw
truth he is imbued.
He always thinks before he acts, thee
acts with promptitude.
There is a man in our town?'tis curious,
but true?
Who looks all questions up and down,
then locks them through and
through.
He rids his brain of dust and fuzz; j
and leaves upon the shelf !
Old Custom's musty tomes; and does
his thinking for himself.
There is a man in our town?or any
town on earth? j
Whose name, perchance, is Smith or
Brown, a man of sirAple worth.
'Tis not his thought that stand apart
They're neither stout nor tall.
The man is lonely, bless your heart, because
he thinks at all.
?Grit' Alexander, in Pittsburgh Dispatch.
f
?o?
Xow, what do you think about that?
"The man is lonely, bless your heart, because
he thinks at all.'" We are getting
in the habit of letting other people
think lor us, and of letting the government
do everything for us. It is dangerous.
A big centralized government
was the cause of the downfall of some
of the big empires of the past, and we
are getting away from the good old
doctrine promulgated and preached by
the founders of this republic. We need
to hie back and secure our moorings
and find out where we are at. It's a
fact, and you may laugh at me for saying
so, but some day the one who takes
time to look back over the files of the
aid Herald and News will admit that I
was not such a bad dreamer after all.
HThis ma) be wandering just a little
from the theme with which I started
.mt, but the idea is all the same. I
see where the legislature understook to
play wet nurse for the people who work
jrv the' cotfdrf* mffis:' 11 reck&rr
thought it would give them votes, but.
relieve mat thj^men who work in tne r
oills in Newberry county are just as
.<M)d as the other people who work'
isewhere. and that they are just as!
ompetent to make their own contracts
is any other people, and that the men j
v'no control and direct the mills in
Newberry are just as good as other!
men, and know just as much about
running their business, and are just as
considerate of the help who work in
their mills as the members of the legislature
and nnssihlv iust a little more
so. Now, they have said by legislative !
enactment that the mills must pay off
;?very week. Why single out the mills
'n this particular? Why not say that
the farmer and the merchant and the
banker and the newspaper man and all
the rest of them must pay off every
week? T don't know anything about it,
of course, and, therefore, I am not
Jully competent t<-> write intelligently
itj<! learnedly on i:ie suujcti, just imci
chose members of the legislature were j
to pass laws regulating those things, j
Xow. I don't own a dollar's worth of j
stock in any cotton mill, and never did, |
i
and I believe in seeing to it that the cor- j
porations do not oppress the poor, but
i <i" not see the wisdom of picking outcertain
corporations that -have "been
worth a whole lot in the commercial
growth and devlopment of the State,
and to be continually passing laws to
regulate their business, in tact, ac-1
cording to my way of looking at things
we arc trying to regulate entirely too j
much by legislation any way., But I
reckon it is all right or it wouldn't be,
and it will come out right when it is
washed.

The child labor law ^ all right but
they are putting the age limit mighty
high I can remember away back yonder
when I was about 12 to 14 years
old how I used to work and do all

sorts ot worK, arm uo ui it, i.jm j
fact more than I can do now. I could j
plow and I could drive a wagon and I;
could do a lot of incrs/and I had to do
'em, too, and lion't you forget that j
and I see now where I was the better for
the doing of the Why at that age I
was as strong and almost as large as I
act now, and there was no .child labor
law then to keep my dad from making
me. t went to school but in va
cction and on Saturday and in the after
noons I did a lot of ihings. But maybe
the children of this day need more protection
and more government supervision
that did the chXdrer. away back
\crder. , . r .
Arrd this reminds me to say that in
those days- when we went to school we
started out early in-the morning and
took our dinner buckets with us, and
had an hour for dinner, and then we
went back in the school room, and we
remained there until late in the afternoon,
and we had to do some. work.
Whv. blc<s your life, I had an oppor
tunity a short while ago to take a little |
trip to the country, and before I o'clock
I saw the children on their way home
from school. The school was out and
they were home for dinner. , Maybe the
teachers are brighter and the children
are brighter and it doesn't take so !ong
for them to know their lessons and do
the work of the school.
I have strayed away off from the city
beautiful, "but I have to change the sub'
ject occasionally, and I write whatever
' 1 T 4-i?rr onrl if it |
1 tnirJK wnen i dm nnuug, ?uu ?
(.Iocs not suit you, wny just skip it over
and go on to the next place. I will not
be in the least offended. If I should
stick to the idea I started out with I
would have to get on the manner in
which the cemetery is kept, or rather not
kept, and the beautiful fence that encloses
the grounds, and the cleanness
<~>f thp streets, and then
dUU u> ?... v ,
maybe the cemetery directors and the
city fathers and the civic association
would think I was writing about things
that I had no business?not what I
didn't know?not that, because I do
know a few things, if I do make bold
to say so myself. Let every one cooperate
and if every one will sweep before
his own door and look after the |
premises, there will not be need to depend
upon the government to tell you
what to do. A little cooperation and
self help is the thing and the work is
done already.
