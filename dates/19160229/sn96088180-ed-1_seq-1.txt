marine announced today tbat tbe
French auxiliary crulaer Provence
bad been aunk Saturday In the Medi
terranean. Two hundred and ninety-six men
of ber crew were landed at Malta.
Tbe Provence dispatches did not

Faanet and a Swedish ablp were re
cently torpedoed there.
Tbe Provence la believed to be the
pitlatlal liner formerly In tbe trans
Atlantic aervice, but more recently
on admiralty duty. That vessel waa
of 18,000 torn and 600 feet long.
There la also a battleship Pro
vence and a 4,000-ton ateamer
rrovence, but obviously from tbe de
scription tbe aunken liner was
neither of thcie.
Tbe Provence probably waa car
rying troopa either to or from Sal

continues in tbe rulna of the Douau-J
mont fortress, the Germans are feel

mile front
Indications are that tbe whole
western front may auddenly burst In
to flames. ,
As for the Verdun front Itself,
Paris reported a slackening of the
German artillery Are along tbe eight
mile line of ruin to tbe northeast of
tbe fortress. This la due to the shlft-
lng of artillery and the bringing np
of' reserves to replace regiments
blotted out during the past week's
saturnalia of destruction. y
Meanwhile, Paris Is coolly confi
dent tbat Verdun will never fall
through a frontal attack over the
"Pepper heights." The feeling is
that the kaiser already despairs of
victor there, and is either searching
out a new road to Parte through the
Champagne or preparing to renew
the Fresnes attack. The tide Is about
to turn to tbe French arms, Paris
believes.
According to 8wiss advices, the
Verdun attack, despite Its appalling
destruction of life, is merely a di
version. These dispatches declare the Ger
mans are albout to hammer at a point
between Koyon and St. Quentln, 1 are

an effort to reach the French capital.
Estimates of the German dead in

than that the total runs into tbe tens
