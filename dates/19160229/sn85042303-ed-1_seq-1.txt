REPORTED THAT WIRT, SAID TO
HAVE BEEN HAVEN FOR THE
ADDICTS OF THE PILL, HAS
WITNESSED EXODUS.
It was reported some time ago that
Wirt w as a good place in w hich to
live for the addicts of the drug that
soothes, as the druz in all its var
ious ramifications was easily obtain-
ihle, but since a special officer from
tr.o state and national government
has been known to be working in this
vicinity, there has been a scattering
of the users of Hie drug, and now
they say that "dope" of any kind is
extremely scarce in the oil Held
metropolis.
It is confidently expected that some
thing is about to drop in the select
circle of users and vendors of the
drug, and under the terms of the
Harrison act, it is going to be rather
hard on those caught selling the stuff
in defiance of law. Kefore the Har
rison law went into effect all towns
in the southern .portion of the -state
were infested with those unfortunates
addicted to the drug habit, as it was
infested will those unfortunates ad
dicted to" the drug habit, as it w as
but little trouble to secure the "dope,"
but since that time there has been a
falling off, until about the only ones
the officers have to deal with are
strays from other places, who are
given short shift here.
It is alleged that considerable boot
I legging of the stuff has been going
on lately, and for that reason an in
vestigation was made to determine
the facts. The officer who was here
is evidently satisfied with his search,
am! vaguely hinted that something is
E.'iing to haiipen in the near future.

a formal note presented by Count
von Ilernstorff to Secretary Lansing
Monday reiterated assuraiiceH regard,
ing tlu; future conduct of mihmarlnu
fwarfare given in tho Lusllanl.'i case,
declares thoso insurances have not
been modified by tho memorandum
setting forth its intention to treat,
armed merchantmen of tho enlout
allies as auxiliary cruisers after miil
night tonight, and attempts to ins-
tify the issuance of the memorandum
by presenting evidence and assertions
designed to prove that the British
government lias Instructed merchant
men to use their armament for pur
poses of attack In violation of assur
ances given the United States.
All things considered, the state de
partment is understood to feel that
the possibility Is more or less remotu
of difficulties arising In the near fu
turo as a result of the new German
and Austrian policy. In the first place
officials believe that commnnders of
German and Austrian submarines wilt
talto particular care not to attack)

sels upon which there may be Ameri
cans. This belief was strengthened by the
declaration In the German note re
ceived today which was acquiesced
in by Austria through Fiaron Zwiedi
nek, charge of the embassy here, that
the orders issued to the naval com
manders were so formulated as to pre
vent the destruction of enemy liners
"on account of their armament un
less such armament Is proved."
