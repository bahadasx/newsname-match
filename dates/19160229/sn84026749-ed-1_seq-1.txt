TO CLERKS' AID
IN THE HOUSE
Congressman Austin Develops
That No Hearing Was Held
on Borland Amendment.
NOT ASKED BY OFFICIALS
Spokesman For Appropriation
Measure Admits "Rider"
Should Have Been Discussed
f The first rally of the friends of
the Government clerks in the
.House against the 'Borland eight
hour rider came today.
Congressman Byrns, in charge
of tho legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill, was
subjected to a rapid fire cross
examination' regarding the Bor
land amendment
Congressman Byrns frankly ad'
mittcd that no hearings had been
held on this amendment nor had it
ever been advocated by any Cabi
net officer or bureau chief.
FAVORS 'OPEN HEARINGS.
Mr. Byrns further acknowledged that
ho personally believed there should
have been hearings on so Important n.
piece of legislation, although he said
he did not consider (t-unjust to require
eight hours of labor of Government em
ployes. 'Tho first reference to the Borland
amendment was made by Congressman
Austin of .Tennessee, when Congress
nut Bryns arose to discuss In a geu
eral way the legislative bill. . , , . .
Mr. Hyrna said ho had not Intended
to discuss the eight-hour rider unUl
the Hem was reached In debate.
"Was there any hearing on that
amendment."" iskod -Congressman ,Aua-
"Ncvcthere waa not," said Mr. Byrns.
"Did any Cabinet officer or bureau
chief recommend an eight hour. da it'
continued Mr. Austin.
"No uch recommendaUon was pre
sented to the committee or to mo or to
any member of the comlttee. sa far aa
I know." said Mr. Byrns. .,,.
He then explained that tho Borland
aendment Was never presented to his
subcommittee, which framed tho legis
lative bill. Mr. AuaUn asked if there
was any assuranco that there would be
A reduction In the force of Government
flauloyes. or If the pending bill car
gtd any reduction. ... . ,.
"This bill was framed." replied Mr.
Byrns. "without taking Into cbnsldera
tion the Borland amendment. We did
not know it would bo offered."
Docs Not Reduce.
Then this bill does not mean any re
duction of expenses.'' said Congressman
Austin, forecasting the debato that will
come when a point of order Is made
that tbe rlaer aoes not come wuiun ira
Holman rule.
"t am not prepared to say now," said
Congressman Byrns, "what reductions
would be effected.' I tell you the bill
was prepared without contemplation
that such, an amendment would be Of
fered. Congressman Cox of Indiana asked It
tho oiBrland amendment would not af
fect 80,000 clerks. Recolvlng an affirma
tive reply, Mr. Cox said: "If that Is
true, then, and if 30.000 clerks work
eight hours a day Instead of aevon,
they ought to bo able to do more work,
and If this amendmont does not mean
the dlschargo of any clerk It would
enable the Government to do Its work
without taking on any more employes
and thus reduce expenses."
Congressman Austin asked Mr. Byrne
If there had been any reduction in the
force when a halt hour was added to
the clerks' day several years ago. Mr.
Byrne said ho did not know.
Mlnorltr Rennrt Ttaadv.
Congressman James A, Ualllvan of
massacnuseua, a memoer or tne Appro
priations Committee, wilt tile his mi
nority report on the Borland rldor to
day or tomorrow. Mr, Galllvan's mi
nority report Is nn elaboration of his
views as made known In an Interview
.Saturday night, when Mr. Ualllvan re
turned to the city and discovered that
his committee had overwhelmingly voted
nn eight-hour day for the Government
clerks.
Mr. Galllvan's minority report says
In part:
. It (the Borland rider) Involves legis
lation utterly repugnant to all recent
Icgltlatlon of Btato and nation which
iccognlzes tho shortening of hours ot
labor ns a fundamental principle of hu
man welfare.
If enacted it would result i a de
crease of efficiency In the administra
tive machinery of the National Gov
ernment and In many instances cause
a dislocation of work tantamount to
utter demoralization. ,
It would work hardships upon
thousands of patriotic, unselfish, hard
working employes of the Government
without accomplishing any good elth

Old Glory Upside Down as Bor

"Who's In distress over at the Muni
cipal Building?" asked a wayfarer this
morning aa he gazed at tho flagpole of
that structure.
"Everybody," said tho well-Informed
Washlngtonlan. "They've gotta work
eight hours a day over there if the
Borland amendment is approved by
Congress."
"I guess that's why they have tho
flag turned upside down," commented
the wayfarer as he moved away.
Sure enough, the flag on the Municipal
Building waa upside down. The national
emblem so hung denotes distress all
over tne worm.
Several hundred people stopped with
in a few minutes and wondered If the
Municipal building flag was reflective
of the gloom underneath. Then some
body notified the flag tender, and he
hastily changed the bunting, putting the
starry part of the flag toward the
heavens.
Probably the whole thing was Just a
mistake of the flagman but the critical
fellow who Isn't a Government clerk
thought ho saw a "distress signal" in
the droopy flag that waved the wrong
way.

President Wilson and his advisers are

10 BOATS HUNT SURVIVORS

PARIS, Feb. 29. About 1,000
lives are believed to have been
lost in the sinking of the 'French
auxiliary cruiser Provencn, form
erly in service as a trans-Atlantic
liner, in the middle Mediterranean
on Saturday.
Eighteen hundred persons were
aboard the cruiser, an official
statement from the ministry of
marine stated.
Of this number, 296 of the crew
have been landed at Malta, and
about 400 on the Greek island of
Melos. .
' ' 870 ARE SAVED.
A later official statement from tho
admiralty put the total number prob
ably saved, at 870. making the number
missing about 1,000.
Ten boats are now at the scene of the
disaster, continuing the search for other
survivors, the ministry of marine an
nounced. NEW TORK. Feb. J9.-In all prob
ability the Provence was carrying troop
either from or to Salonlkl. The Island
of Malta and Melos, where survivors
were landed, are 600 miles apart. Melos
lies off the southeast 'coasi of Greece.
It Is probable that the Provence was
sunk somewhere between the Greek
west coast and the Island of Malta.
Dispatches to the United Press from
Paris, transmitted through Paris di
rect, and also other dispatches, trans
mitted through London, did not state
whetheer the Provence waa sunk by a
submarine, by a mine, or was the vio
Um of an accident.
Submarines are known to have been
operating in the mid-Mediterranean for
some time, the British steamer Faatnet
and a. Swedish steamer, having been
torpedoed In those waters within tho
last few days.
itecently the British censor has
eliminated all reference to submarine
attacks, allowing messages stating that
a steamer has been torpedoed to read
only "waa sunk." The French censor,
however, has permitted correspbndents
to cable the fact that ships have been
submarined.
The auxiliary cruiser Pmmni im
la believed to be the palatial Kronen
liner of that name, formerly In trans-
jmiuiuio service.
In Admiralty Service.
Tho liner rrovenoe waa In the ad
miralty service, it was stated at the
French lino offices hero today. It waa
said, however, tho government would
not notify them in case the ship was
lost.
Tho Provence waa of 18,000 tons, and
about COO feet long. Thera Is a French
battleship of the same name, but It
Is obvious this Is not tho vessel refer
red to as having been lost. The ract
that there were 1.800 neraona bmM

Shipping lists show a second steel

such a small boat would bet crowded
