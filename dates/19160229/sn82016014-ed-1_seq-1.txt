Washington, Feb. 2 9. Announce
ment of Italy's seizure of (lerman
ships in Italian waters attracted
much attention in official and diplo
matic circles and in some quarters the
lieiief was expressed that the seizure
eventually might lead to war between
Italy and Germany.
One of the leading explanations ad
vanced for Italy's action was that she
proposed to answer the new Ger
manic submarine campaign which
goes into effect at midnight by send
ing German owned ships to sea to
meet the Teutonic submersibles. An
other explanation advanced was that
Great Britain, short of ocean ships
fmm submarine activities, wanted to
use the ships in Italian ports and was
urging Italy to war on Germany.
Kecent reports from London said
that grave interest was being displayed
in Frigland over the possibility of a
declaration f war on Germany by
Italy when the Italian parliament
opens March 1. The Italian govern
ment, according to dispatches received
in London from Rome on Sunday, had
not yet decided whether it would yield
to the popular demand for a war with
Germany.

PLEA ISJN VAIN
Unwritten Law Doesn't Fit
Case, Says Prosecutor.
Husband of 15-Year-01d Bride
Present at Warren Slaying.
Fort Worth, Tex., Feb. 29. The
"unwritten law" will not save Cath
erine Harrison, 15 years old, bride of
a local banker's son, from prosecution
for the murder of W. L. Warren, 60,
proprietor of a hoarding house, whom
she confessed she shot because he
wronged her a year ago.
This was stated positively this after
noon by Marshall Spoonts, county at
torney. "Will the fact that Warren If Mrs.
Harrison's confession is true was lia
ble to a death sentence for his alleged
attack upon her, affect her prosecu
tion for murder?" Spoonts was asked.
"Most assuredly not," he declared.
"She has confessed that she murdered
Warren and that her husband was with
her at the time. The case against
both of them will proceed as rapidly
as possible."
Mrs. Harrison's arrest resulted from
the fact that she made a confidant of
a girl chum. The girl, an 18-year-old
ward of the juvenile court, according
to the county attorney's office, carried
the secret of Warren's murder until
she was on the verge of a mental
breakdown.

' At that time the period of warning

SEGREGATE NEGRO
Referendum Vote in St, Louis
Today on Subject.
Can't Reside in Block Where 75
Per Cent Are White.
DOESN'T AFFECT OWNERSHIP
Restricts Solely Use of Property
for Living Purposes.
Sixty-Five Election Officers on
Duty at $5 Each.
St. Louis. Mo., Feb. 29. Voters of
St. Louis are deciding at a referendum
election today whether two measures,
designed to restrict the negro popula
tion to certain parts of the city, shall
become ordinances.
Two bills, both submitted by petition
under the initiative clause of the city
charter, are being voted on. One pro
vides that negroes shall not move into
blocks occupied wholly by white per
sons, or that white persons shall not
move-into blocks occupied wholly by
negroes.
The other proposed ordinance pro
vides that negroes shall not move Into
blocks in which 75 per cent of the
houses are occupied by whites, or that
white persons shall not move into
blocks in which 7 5 per cent of the
houses are occupied by negroes.
If both ordinances are adopted, the
second, being the more stringent of
the two. would be effective.
Neither ordinance puts any restric
tion on the ownership of property, but
restricts solely the use of property
for residence purposes. Negroes who
are employed in houses or apartments
occupied by white persons are unaf
fected by the ordinances. Apartment
house janitors, who live in the base
ments of apartments occupied by
whites would not be affected.
About son Blocks for Negroes.
Both ordinances contain clauses
providing that the proposed laws shall
not affect persons at present living in
blocks occupied by members of the
other races.
If the "whole block" ordinance is
adopted, about 500 blocks in the city
would be available for negro resi
dence. If the more stringent or "75
per cent measure" is i-dopted, only
about 150 blocks will be available for
negro residence.
Attorneys say certain clauses of the
"75 per cent" ordinance are vague,
and litigation seems certain if either
ordinance is adopted.
The ordinances have been strenu
ously opposed by negro organizations
and by many white friends of the race
as tending to crowd the negros into
limited sections of the city. The or
dinances have been supported by
many whites who argue that the prop
erty values of small home owners are
imperilled by the possibility that ne
groes may move next door to whites.

among those who showed most .ilufrly

that It originated accidentally as Creed

no facts about the family would lead
to suspicion of incendiarism.

of the Creed children came to the
home of a neighbor owning a farm
adjoining the Creed place, that was
last seen of any member of the dead
j family. Coroner's ;nquest Is beinf
