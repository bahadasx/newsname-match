HOWELL WINS
BATTLE FOR
WARVETERANS
Amendment to Pension Bill for Reg
ulars Is Carried On the Floor ot
the Houso After Being Defeated.
Washington, Feb. 20. Congress
ninn Joseph Howell by c'over pnrlla
mentary maneuver and logical argu
incut secured an amendment in thr
Houso of Representatives to tfie
pension bill for regulars who took
part in tho Indian wars to Include
all thoso who took part in the hull
an wars In Utah from 18G5 to 1807
Inclusive. Tho nmendment was ot
fered from the floor ot tho Honao In
opposition to the leaders who had the
bill In chargo and In opposition to
tho Houso committee on pensions and
Congressman Howell had his amend
ment adopted. His debate with
Congressman Keating of Colorado
regarding tho amendment to tho bill
Is given lu tho Congressional Rec
ord. When tho bill to pension regulars
who were engaged In tho Indian
wars was before tho Houso commit
tee every effort to have Included 'n
it tho veterans of tho Indian wars In
Ut,nh was defeated. When It was
brought out for passage and tho
amendment offered It wns pointed
out by thoso opposed to Congressman
Howell's amendment that tho bill
had not been drawn for tho pufposo
of Including In tho pensions others
than members of tho regular army
who were engaged In tho inuian
wars in tho pensions.
Nevertheless tho arguments made
by Congressman Howell In behalf of
his amendment Induced tho Houso
to permit tho amendment to go In.
Tho Inclusion of tho veterans who
fought In tho Indian wars in Utah
from 1865 to 18G7 will glvo pensions
to a largo number of Indian w-ar vet
erans In Utah. This Is the first time
that tho Indian war veterans of
Utah havo boon included In any gen
eral pension bill rolatlng to Indian
wars In the west.
Tho winning of the point by Con
gressman Howell and the inclusion
of tho amendment in tho bill is ro
garded as ono of tho most Btrlklng
and conspicuous compliments which
the House could pay Congressman
Howell.
