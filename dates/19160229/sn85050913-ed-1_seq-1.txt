Repres6ntltiVe of Redpath-Vawter
Bureau Here and Meets
./.v4V
with Directors.«
At a mfeeting of the directors of
the commercial league Friday night
it was finally decided to put on a
municipal lecture course for next
winter in thiB city. The league has
had assurances from both the city
schools and the women's clubs that
active support would be given such a
venture and with th$Be assurances,
they felt encouraged to father the
course.
A representative of the Redpath-
(Vawter
lyceum bureau was present
with the league and the matter sat
^factorily gone over. Saturday
board composed of President Perry
of the commercial league, Supt. Kel
ly of the city schools, and three rep
resentative women of the city met at
the Wardrobe and selected the course
for next winter.
A five number course wks decided
upon, containing two lectures, one
entertainment and two musical feat
ures. The talent included is com
posed of the
beBt
the Redpath-Vaw-
ler people have to offer and was care
fully chosen with an eye to the
wants of .the ordinary people who 4o

Dr. Edward Steiner, author, lect
urer, cblidge ptoftasor and recogniz
ed authqrity upon the ""Immigrant"
question, wis the first choice'of the
committee who selected the talent,
and it is felt will prota one of the
strongest features offered. Drr Stein
er
is
personally known by Grinnell
students of this city, who have sat,
under his teachings. He is knowa
also by readers who have had their
eyes opened by reading "The Trail
of the immigrant," and have read
and re-read
hiB
other books.
Nels Darling, a business'man of
Oklahoma City, Okla., speaks upon
Community Building. He is a lect
urer of great wit as well as wisdom
and is in demand all over the United
States where people are interested in
"their communities. In so far as the
Commercial League are back of this
movement, it was thought wise to
have such a man upon the course for
next winter.
Katherine Ridgeway, who has
teen one of the most popular enter
tainers for several years, has been
until the last year unobtainable for
lyceum bureaus, but having appear
ed in this city twice, she is well
enough known that further mention
of her ability as an entertainer is un
necessary.
The Cathedral Choir with Thirlow
Lieurance as director, comprises nine
of the j©untry's highest salaried
choir BingerB under the direction of
Mf. Lieurance who Is known among
musicians as second only tS'Cadman
as authority on Indian music and
songB. Ho Is a composer of marked
ability and his compositions have
been played and sung by Webster
City people for years. This Is one of
the two musical numbers for the
lecture course.
Bolimir Kryl and his two young
daughters, Marie Kryl, a pianist,
who recently iceived the distinction
and the prise which went with It—
of being the best trained child musi
cally in America—and Josephine
Kryl, violinist, who has been re-en
gaged as Violinist with the Thomas
Orchestra this coming winter. This
trio of artists will delight not only
the musical people of the city, but
especially the young people, many of
whom have read of the strict train
ing undergone by these two daugh
ters o& the famous bandmaster whose
band appeared here at the Chautau
qua last summer. Kryl and any of
his family Will always find ,a warm
welcome In Webster City,
The price for season tickets has

not been fixed but it will be, very low
—not over $1.50 and possibly only
$1 for the course. The place oft hold
ing the numbers has not been decid
ed upon, but will probably be the
Methodist church, which is central
ly located and has the organ which
will be in requisition by the Cathe
dral Choir.
This is a movement which may re
ceive and will require, the earnest
support of every person in Webster
City. This city has not enjoyed a
winter's course for two years and
the quality offered in this course will
be of the very first class. Club wom
en are going to he asked to help ac
tively and business men and women
wilt also lend their aid toward mak
ing the course a success. If the thing
merely pays expenses, it will have
been of great value. If one or two
hundred dolldrs is made it will Tie
all the better.

Frank Calkins has resigned his po
sition as assistant night transferman
for the American express company
in this city and accepted the position
of night agent for, the American ex

Digging Hole.
A workman Saturday forenoon
was digging a hole in the illley back
of the Orpheum theater for the re
ception of a pole for the lines of the
Iowa Telephone company. He dug
down a foot or two and then some,
•when his spade suddenly encounter
iedi )me hard substance. He was em
d" id to dig a hole and that was
he was going to do—"his not
to reason why"—so he kept on dig
ging the hole even though with
sharp blows of his spade he had to
dig through the center of the hard
substance he encountered.
That one sharp blow of the spade
caused consternation in every home
and place of business from the John
son House east to Foster's iarniture
store and all north of that district
as far as Riverside ball park.
The literal obedience to orders, no
matter what happened, cut the big
400-wlre telephone cable belonging
to the Martin telephone company
and from that minute until late Sun
day/afternoon and indeed In some in
stances until today, those phones
were out of commission..
Had the hard substance encoun
tered been a dynamite bomb, por
tions of that stolid representative of
Sweden, who was at the handle of
the spade, would have been scatter
ed all over the business section of
Webster City, for he was employed
to dig a hole and he dug it regardless
of what lie might strike with his
spade enroute. Faithful workman

Chicken Fie Supper.
The supper given at the English
Lutheran church Friday night was
an unqualified success In every par

many people who were unstinted in
their commendations of the liberal

ed. The room was well decorated
with pictures by Wallace Nutting
an£ a variety of local views, while
graphophone, xylophone and angelus
in turn gavo a pleasing variety of
musical entertainment. The finan
cial proceeds were correspondingly
satisfactory1, amounting to $52.

Saturday's Basketball Game Fast
and Furious—Score 27 to 20—
Webster City Loses.
The basket ball game at Pomeroy
Saturday afternoor/ between the
Pomeroy high school team and the
Webster City team wad one of the
cleanest games of the season. Those
who witnessed it say it was the fin
est game to watch that has been
played this winter. Playing was
fast and furious and the score left
Pomeroy the winners with 27 to 20.
The treatment and hospitality ex
tended our {earn by the Pomeroy
school and team was the best receiv
ed this year by the basketball boys.
It only compares with that received
by the Webster City football team
when they went to Spirit Lake. The
boys went at the game like Trojans
and every play was a credit to Web
ster City even though they failed to
secure the high score.
The next thing on the basketball
program is a tournament the date
for which will be given later.
The W. E. Berogan family will
Wednesday move to their forty acre
farm two miles northeast of town.
Their houBe on Division street will

The two little children of Mr. ancl
Mrs. Charles Barton, who reside on

Saturday afternoon with scalding
water at their home, when the moth
er attempted to fill the bath tub
with boiling water with a pall from
the stove.. j- .?•
The live" year'olff"T)oy was taking
the shoes from his little two year
old Bister's feet, and both were sit
ting upon the floor near the tub. Just
as Mrs. Barton reached the tub with
the boiling water, the ball on the
pail came off and at least half the
contents of the pail vfent over the
little ones. The little girl was the
more Beriously burned, the burn ex
tending from the right shoulder down
to the feet. The boy was not so bad
ly burned, the most of the water go
ing over his legs below the knees.The
skin came off with the clothing as
the baby girl was undressed and her
burns are considered dangerous.

Expects Closer Kelations Between
the United States and Great
Britain.
Daily Capital: "I feel that be
fore this war is over some accident
will happen that will bring Great
Britain and the United States into a
closer union," declared Dr. J. L. Gor
don of Winnipeg, Canada, who ar
rived in Des Moines today to begin
a two weeks' citizenship campaign
at Plymouth Congregational church.
"1 feel that it is inevitable that
the English speaking nations should
be bound closer together. I cannot
say when this will occur, but to me
there is little question but that it
will come.
"Everything in Canada has been
affected by the war. The people are
all talking it. Canada origlpally
planned to send 50,000 men, but
now It is 250,000. The Canadians
will spend their last dollar and send
their last son if necessary to see vic
tory for the British empire. Canada
can't understand the neutrality ol
the United States. The people don't
know the strange mixture of nation
alities in the states. They think Ger
many's plan is the biggest piece of
international burglary ever attempt
ed."
Dr. Gordon declared |ie cannot
conceive of any immediate time in
the future when It will be safe for
the United States to be without arm
ament.

Webster City Team Loses Hard
Fought Contest by Score
of 23 to 33,.
In one of the best games of the
season, the Webster City high school
basketball five met defeat Friday
afternoon at the hands of the speedy
Fort Dodge quintette. The defeat
was the first chalked up against
the locals this year on their home
floor.
The game was won during the
first half, which ended with the
score 20 to 9 for the visitors. In
the second half, the home team stag
ed a thrilling rally for the benefit of
the crowd of Webster City rooters,
and held their opponents on even
terms at 13 all. In floor work, the
visitors showed no superiority over
the locals, their inargln being gain
ed in greater accuracy in locating
tho basket when the ball was in
their possession.
The outstanding feature of the
contest was the work of Pitzer, Fort
Dodge's guard. He made 22 of the
visitors' 33 points. For Webster
City, France and Wilkinson played
the best basketball. The latter
achieved the distinction of scoring
three baskets against Larson of Fort
Dodge, who is reputed to have held
all his opposing men scoreless both
last year and thus far this year.
The largest crowd of the year wit
nessed the game. The management
deplores the fact that the contest
was marred at tim6s, especially when
the visitors were throwing fouls, -by
the ^unsportsmanlike conduct of the
rooters on the sidelines, which show
ed a marked contrast to the cour
tesy usually given the visiting' team.
