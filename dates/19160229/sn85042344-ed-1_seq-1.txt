ON JIM CROW ISSUE
ST. I.OT.'IS, Feb. 2S. Two proposed
ordinances providing for the segrega

submitted to the people at the refer

One ordinance prohibits negroes
from moving into blocks In which 75
per cent of the families are white. A
less stringent brdinance prohibits
them from moving Into blocks wholly
occupied by whites. If both ordi
nances are adopted the "5 per cent
law as the more stringent is called,
will prevail.
The ordinances provide similar re
strictions against white persons mov

A vigorous campaign for and

"If Attacked by British We

WASHIXtiTO.V, Feb. 28. New
construction fotlie navy should
be limited this year only by the coun
try's facilities to build. Ilt.ar Admiral
Austen M. Knight, president of the
navy war college, told the house naval
committee today. If an udeipuito fleet
is to be made ready by 1925, he de
clarcd. an immediate iniilry should
be made to determine the extent of tlin
facilities and to plan for even greater
building programs each year until
the I nlted States nuvy is tlic strong
est force ufloat.
"It is a big program

only the limit of construction fa
cilities, the admiral explained, had
caused the general board to fix IS 2 5
as the dale the American fleet should
Ltiial any afloat.
"If wu could get It," he said, "I
would say we need it now today, to
morrow." In reaching its decision, the witness
said, the hoard had before It the
specter of a double assault aval list
the l'nited Slates with enemies in
the Atlantic and Pacific ti meet at
the same time (jiieslloued by Repre
sentative Callaway, he said the fleet
proposed would meet any such com
bination that did not include Knu
luml, and he thought It unlikely that
a combination against the l'nited
States, including that country, ever
would be formed. Ask if he had any
reason tn believe there was danger of
.'mother combination, 'he admiral said
"yes", and he was not pressed to
I'liiplily his statement.
No Match for Fnglunil.
Representative. Itut ler asked w hether
tho sudden entrance of the l'nited
States into tile race for naval suprem
acy would not cause other nations to
increase their programs. The admiral
thought not, for several years at least,
or until the American fleet began to
approach the Hritish, for instance, In
size.
Asked by Representative Kelley
what the present fleet could do in
ease of an attack, Admiral Knight
sai J :
"If we were attacked by the Kng
lisb fleet I think the navy ought to
shut itself up in some harbor, but
against -my other navy we ought to
go uu. and do the best we can." He
was not without hopes, ho said, that
victory might lodge with the smaller
force. It was suggested that war
Willi Kngland was extremely unlikely.
Admiral Knight said this was open
to iiiestlon, although the general
boiiri!"s plan had not contemplated any
possible enemy combination Includ
ing Kngland. The strange diplomatic
developments of the present war, he
thought, made almost anything pos
sible and he added:
"Certain features which we have
heretofore regarded as features of
safety have now become points of
danger. I am not sure we will never
ha.e a war with Kngland."
