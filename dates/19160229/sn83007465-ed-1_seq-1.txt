AT GRIDIRON CLUB
President Says He Would
Just as Much Ashamed to

Washington, Feb. 27.?Pre:
dent Wilson told members a:
guests at a Gridiron Club dinn
last night that America oug
to keep out of the European wj
"at the sacrifice of everythii
except this single thing up
which her character and her h
tory are founded, her sense
humanity and justice."
The address was confident
since the speeches at the di
ners of the Gridiron Club, co
^ posed of newspaper correspor
ents, are not reported. It w
made public tonight, howew
with the consent of the preside
and the club, because many
those who heard it urged tl
it should go to the country.
The President spoke of the r
tion's affairs with unusual gr;
ity. His hearers, including s<
eral hundred members of c<
gress, government officials, bu
ness men and corresponaen
were brought, to their feet che
ing when he concluded with th<
words:
True Valor.
"I would be just as much a:
amed to be rash as I would
be a coward. Valor is selfspecting.
Valor is circumspe
Valor strikes only when it
right to strike. Valor withho
itself from all small impli
tions and entanglements a
waits for the gi^eet onnortun
when the sword will flash as
it carried the light of hea>
upon its blade."
In his address he said:
"T have very little to say

warm appreciation of the iiv
riable courtesy of tin's club a
W- of the reception you have

that T am seldom tempted to *
