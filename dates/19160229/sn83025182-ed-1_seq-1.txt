Review of Events Which Led
Up to Submarine Controversy
Granted that orders for merchant
men to operate offensively against
submarines were secreiiy Issued, as
charged by the Germans, the defense
of the British government doubtless
will be that this step became neces
sary on account of the adoption by
the Germans of the policy of sinking
vessels without warning. It was not
long after "Der Tag that there began
a series of submarines without warn
ing not only of unarmed passenger
liners and cargo snips, but also of
Inoffensive fishing vessels.
The British view Is that the inaug
uration of this sort of warfare thor
ougmy justified the nullification by
ureat Britain of the pledge given to
the United States through Ambassa
dor Sir Cecil Spring Rice that British
merchantmen would never be used
for purposes of attack that they
would be armed only for defense and
that tney would never fire unless iirst
fired upon.

that the recent practical suspension
of submarine warfare in the vicinity
