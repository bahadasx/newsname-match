Month VOL. XJII. NO. 61. TACOMA. WASH., TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 29,1916. Edition
WHY WILSON IS
SO "STUBBORN"
The papers for days have been full of a new controversy
over the torpedoing of merchant vessels.
Germany's latest policy, under which she will assume an
attitude of greater "frightfulness" than ever, is to go into
force at midnight tonight.
You want to know about it. It is a complicated subject,
but we have done our best to state It ln the simplest possible
terms.
First, it must be divided into two parts:
"Hhi.ll the I'nited Ntates submit to the torpedoing
without warning and without the safe removal of passen
ger* of unarmed merchant ships of belligerent nations?
Shall the I'nited Htaies submit to ihe torpedoing,
without warning and without tlie safe removal of passen
gers, of MiMl 11 merchant ships of tlie lielllgerents?
No, says President Wilson, and bis cabinet, because such
action —in either case—by Germany is against international
law.
The international law on both Questions is written in the
custom of nations for hundreds of years. All civilized nations
have respected lite custom for so long that none of them—not
even Germany—denies that such is the law of nations. Tlie
proof of this, and the binding nature of it is shown by the fart
(lint the rules of every navy in the world, including Germany's
uavy. Instruct officers in accordance with the law that mer
chantmen shall not be sunk without due warning, und that
merchant men huve a right to go armed-
President Wilson's contention is that America must uphold
every international law as it was made by civilized nations be
fore the war. Inasmuch as these laws were made by all
nations, all nations must first consent to change tliein. A cer
tain rule of international law may be olisolete, but one nation
cannot change it of its own volition, any more than a defend
ant or a plaintiff in a civil rase can change Ihe law when he
conies Into court because he believes the law Is obsolete.
President Wilson's whole policy can be summed up briefly
as follows:
I iilcss the 1 mini siiites upholds international law during
ibis war, no other nation will. As law breaks down, interna
tional anarchy will build up, aud Amerlru itself, und Its citi
zens, will be victims of such unarchy sooner or later.
International law—the custom of all clvllzed nations—pro
vides that a war vessel shall order an enemy merchant ship
to lie to. Then an officer shall visit her, take possession and
provide for the safety of crew and passengers, after which the
merchant ship can be disposed of as the officer pleases.
An indication of how international law has been on this
subject is shown by instructions issued by the various govern
ments to their officers at sea. The Hritish admiralty manual
of 1888 stales in article 304, which covers the destruction of
an enemy vessel. "The commander to remove her crew and
pupal-, and, if possible, her cargo, and THEN destroy th>'
vessel."
The French instructions of Lee. 19, 1912, provide In arti
cle 154: "lie-ore destruction you will {dure in safety tlie per
sons, whocier they may lie, who are found on board."
The Russian prize regulations of 1895 authorize com
manders of cruisers ."to burn or sink Ihe detained vessel. After
having first taken all the people off It."
It Is immensely interesting to note the Germany prize
regulations adopted the first month of this presnt war, August.
1914. In the German regulations, article 116, says:
"Ilel'ore proceeding to the destruction of the vessel, the
safety of all iiersons on board, and, aa far as |iosslble, their
effects, is to lie provided for."
The naval code of the United States even goes farther,
recognizing the right of an armed merchantman to resist cap
ture by an American man-of-war.
There are many citations In the works on international
law on the subject of the right of a neutral merchant to arm
for defense. It has been the custom for hundreds of years.
Our own great Chief Justice Marshall settled its status as in
ternational law by deciding that merchant ships may go
armed.
This decision in the United States supreme court nearly
a century ago was accepted by all nations.
Therefore an American citizen is absolutely within his
rights to travel 011 an arulfcd merchant ship, the business of
which is to carry merchandise and passengers. It is not a
warship under any law, rule, or custom.

But their doom has been
sealed.
Russian wolfhounds have been
brought ln to police the rauges—
fearless dogs that can outrun the
fleetest prairie wolf and lay his
flank or throat open with a single
sla.,h of the long, deadly muzzle.
The first big hunt Is to btf

gone from the marshes where tho
outlaw packs roam. Race horses
will be used by ranchers in fol
lowing the chase
The kennel of prize wolfhounds
owned by W. O. Matthews here
will guide the less experienced
dogs in the coyote round-up.
More than 30 will be in the
avenging pack—most of them
practiced killers who have been
trained to the deadly work from
puppyhood.
George Drumheller and P. D.
Donaldson, the former a 45,000
--acre rancher, will direct the hunt.
Automobiles as well as fleet
horses are to be used in the big
drive, the first of an extermina
tion campaign.
