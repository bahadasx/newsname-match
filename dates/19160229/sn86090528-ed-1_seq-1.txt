England f reparine to "Throw Whole
Weight into War," Declares Minister
of Munitions; No Shortage of
Shells Expected
V By WILBUR S. FORREST.
(United Fres Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Feb. 16, (By Mail.)
There's a brand new germ in the Brit
ish air. Atmospheric atoms that had
the general effect of something akin
to gloom several months ago and which
prompted. British statesmen an!
public alike to speak less confidently
about the final outcct of the war,
lave disappeared. These atoms have
be.n replaced by brighter colored
atoms; peppy, optimistic little tikes.
From tie big government buildings
in Whitehall to the smallest London
.fT-hop there is a marked change in the
conversation. Every man in the
utreet knows that Britain is getting
f ready for the big show. The average
Britisher still throws out his chest
if the navy is mentioned, but today he
will'show a broader expanse of shirt
front when it conies to talk aohut the
nrmy. The predominant topic of in
terest ha become the Tommies.
With a!out 4,000,000 men In khaki,
England is preparing to do things 1c
I'Sia Syi'iig, oil iaud. That Is common
talk. No Britisher lost any of his
confidence in the navy, but he ha
given up hoiie thnt the German fleet
vill come out and fight, so he is leav
ing tha navy to control the seas and
taking for granted that it will.
Cabinet members, peers and pleb
iuns uliko look forward to the spring
campaign. The government leaden!
who six months ago modified their
earlier pronouncements that "Germany
must be crushed" to the gentler asser
lion that "the war cannot c?ase unt'i
the enemy has evacuated France and
I.'clgmm and restored the rights of
8 nallor nations," are today reasserting
the former statement with unequalled

the army.
Troof that the present talk does
! not originate in ordinary rumor come)
from the highest sources, Lord Derby,
who raised new "fiiiltkms for England's
land forces, is authority for the state
ment that England's military forces
n'iw are superior to chose of her ene
mies in reserves and fighting ability:
that the nation has reached the highest
pitch of national patriotism and that
th's is evidenced by the fact that the
men who will be forced to fight un
der the newly enacted conscription bili
will numl'i-r less than seven per cent
ji.f the fighting eligible as against over
1' per C;nt who joined voluntarily
Here is one of the latest utterances
of Lloyd George, minister of muni
tions:
"Pno-ian la tirennrinc to put her
whole weight into the war, and Oer
ir.anv will feel it in a very short titv.e
It Is an ?ffort such as England has
never made before." Those who have
nnalyzed the minister's statements say
it can only mean that there will be
no shortage of shells in the spring
In their latest speeches Lord Kitcti
mit. Premier Asnuith and others high
in Hie Eovernment, have reflected the
Yew optimism. In his message at the
onenine of the new parliamentary ses
Bion King George speaking throus'i
his nrcmier. declared:
"With a proud and grateful confi
flence 1 look to the courage, tenacity
1 1 fend resource of my navy and army,
r . . 1.!L, tn nor-
in whom we uepena "
form our part in the attainment of this
toil.
"Gentlemen of the house of com
nnnf. you will be asked to mske un
due financial provisions for the conduct
" the war
"My lords and gentlemen: The only
measure? which will be submitted to
you are such as. in the opinion of try
advisors, tend to the attainment of
1 our common ohiect I confidently com
t niend them to our patriotism and loy
1 aliiy and I pray that the Almighty will
give his blessing to your counsels."
Lord Roseberry, among othors, al
ready Is anticipating the results of in
itial victories. Speaking at Edinburg
he declared that his only fear was that
when allied successes began weak
minds -in the nation might cry for a
premature peace. '"Ibis," he added,
"would mean a short peece and
worse war to follow. Germany must
be absolutely crushed."
With thousands of recruits, enlisted
under the Derby group system, distri
buting themselves throughout the coun
try, veteran regiments that have been
training fcr months, are making way
for the raw ones. Where the veterans
are going is a war office secret, bu
the public is aware that they're going
"somewhere" where they'll have stew
er duties. In a dozen bit? military
camps in Eng'and, Scotland and Wales
tens of thousands of enlisted men who
have 'become 'fed up" with camp and
billet life are reviving under the in
fluence of the hope o'. "going out
soon," according to repoits reaching
Unil-u. Troop trainr. often pass
through London with flatearrs trailing
behinii carrying artillery.
Th've are only a few of the elements
which have inspired confU'onco in the
uftst doubting war pessimist of late.
Evcrbody admits that the was has
been bungled somewhat in the past bu:
evidently there is unanimous optimism
about. Ihe future. It is a newlv coioreu
atom in the tJrltish atmosphere that

BERLIN, Feb. 29. The war ofifce
announced today that the Germans
captured an armoured redoubt north
of Fort Douamont and also took 16,000

Repulse German Attacks.
By United Press.
PARIS, Feb. 29. All German at
tacks in the Verdun district during the
past 21 hoars have been repulsed, says
the official statement issued 'by the
war office today.
It is reported! that the French now
ntirely surround Fort Douamont. The
war office admitted that the Germans
captured the village of Manhoulles, It
miles southeast of Verdun, in efforts to
force the evacuation of Verdun by the
"squeezing out" process.
The loss of several French trenches
in Lorraine was also admitted by the
war .orfiee,
By United Press.
LONDON, Feb. 29 It is believel
this morning that the decisive stag
in the great battle for tho possession
of Verdun is about to begin.
Dispatches say the Germans after
having been checked in their savage
onslaughts on Pepper heights, ara
moving up their heaviest artillery for
the purpose of blasting their way
through the armored trenches on th?
ridge which has barred further ad
vance on Verdun from the north.
The Teutons are reported to 'be feel
ing out the French lines w ith artillery
p.iundings along a front one hundred
ml!es long. Infantry attacks along the
same line are also in progress.
There is everv indication that the
whole western front will suddenly
burst into a struggle baffling the im
agination to conceive of its magni
tude and frightfulness,
A Central News agency dispatch
from Amsterdam icports that over 4o,
0110 Germans have been killed in the
assaults around Verdun.
Notwithstanding the fresh reserves
the French have thrown into the af
fray at Fort Douaumont, the German
war office declares that theii" efforts
have been fruitless and that the Ger
mans have advanced their lines toward
Bras and Vacherauville. It also is
claimed that the Germans have entire
ly expelled French from the Meuse
peninsula southward from SamagneuK
and west of Vacherauville.
The new movement in t'asf Cham
pagne is on a front much nearer Paris
than the scene of the operations
against Verdun, the former front being
approximately one hundred miles from
Paris.
Apparently there have been German
tains of some Importance along the
tastern line of tho Verdun salient
leading to St. Michael, where the Teu
tons, pushing westward, are pounding
ths defenses of Manheulles ten miles
southeast of Verdun. They have not
been able to advance beyond this point
however, but reached the foot of tlw
French positions at Cote Lorraine at
several points, Berlin announced.
