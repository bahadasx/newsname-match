VOLUME SIXTY-EIGHT
THEIR PLEDGES
CASE AREO.K.
Formal Notification Given
Lansing By Bemstorff
at Morning Session
INSIST THEY ARE IN
ACCORD WITH LAW
American Notes Are Cited
to Show Fairness of
Admiralty Order
Washington, D. C., Feb. 28.—Tn a
®ote presented to Secretary Landing
today by Count von Bemstorff, the
German ambassador, Germany assures
the United States that it has no inten
tion of revoking the pledges given in
jthe Lusitania ease.
The note says Germany can conceive
of no reason for changing or postpon
ing the new instructions to her sub
marine commanders to treat as war
ships enemy merchant ships armed
defensively" and that special precau
tions have been taken to prevent ships
that are not armed from being at
tacked.
The note'at the outset reiterated
,ithe previous pledges, which were giv
en on Sept 1, and Oct 5, last year for
the safety of unresisting liners, and
then goes on to say the German gov
ernment does not believe those assur
ances have been modified by the new
memorandum.
U. S. Notes Cited.
During the negotiations over the
Lusitania, It says, no mention wns
made of armed merchantmen, and that
the United States in one of its- notes
fbn the Lusitania mentioned unarmed
merchantmen. Attention then is call
ed to the assurances privately given
in which it is stated .that liners will
not be sunk without warning, provided
they do not offer resistance. Atten
tion also is called to the statement of
the American government in its notice
to port authorities that the presence of
armament on board a merchant vessel
creates the presumption that the ves
sel is armed for offense.
It is stated that a submarine com
mander can not be expected to warn
an enemy merchantman which has a
right to fire on the submarine which
warns it, and the German government
-sets up the contention that equipment
and intention to resist a warning giv
en by a submarine does not come with
f?,in. the definition of defensive arma
i-istnt
British Faith Doubted.
Germany contends that a similar
viewpoint was taken by the United
^States and that it had assurances from
the Italian government that its armed
'merchant ships leaving American
ports would not fire on submarines
which warned them. The note then
sets forth that the German govern
ment did not issue Us new instructions
to submarine commanders until after
it had come into possession of confl
dentlal instructions by the British gov
ernment to the commanders of British
merchantmen. It is denied that armed
•British merchant ships of any descrip
tion are peaceful traders, and it is de
clared that the armament on board all
of them Is to be used especially for
purposes of attack.
The note makes It clear that the
rf Berlin government believes its new in
etructions to submarine commanders
,-^are in accord with the viewpoint ex
pressed by the United States in its
memorandum proposing a modus vl
vendi to the entente allies for the dls
armament of merchant ships.
To Make Certain.
It declares that German submarine
commanders have befen so instructed
that they will not destroy a merchant
ship on a question of armament, unless
it is known positively that such arma
ment exists. The declaration that pre
vious pledges will not be revoked also
1b formally given.
Appended to the communication,
which was signed by Count von Bern
etorff, waB a list of about twenty inci
dents where it is charged German and
Austrian submarines have been attack
ed by merchantmen armed ostensibly
for defensive purposes. At no place
in the communication is it suggested
that American citizens be warned to
remain off armed merchant ships, and
the question of what constitutes defen
sive armament is not brought up al
though It is admitted in various quar
ters that such a question probably
•will be raised.
A a a I
Baron Zwiedinek, charge of the Aus
trian embassy, called on Secretary
Lansing after Count von Bemstorff
had left and informed him that Gen
many's views, as set forth in\ the note
jfrom Count von Bemstorff, were iden
tical with those of his government and
that Austria, in effect, seconded every
thing contained in the German com
munication.

ENGLISH LINER
IS DESTROYED BY
E
DISASTER OCCURS JUST OUTSIDE
DOVER MANY PASSENGERS
ARE DROWNED.
London, Feb. 28.—Of the total com
plement of 411 passengers and crew
on the Peninsular and Oriental line
steamship Maloja, whieh struck a mine
and sank within half an hour two
miles off Dover yesterday, only 260 are
known to have been saved. Of the to
tal 119 passenger, 64 names of per
sons saved have been received at the
steamship company's offices. It was
stated there that it is hoped that more
names of persons saved will still be
received.
The bodies of three more Lascars of
the crew of the Maloja have been
washed ashore, making the total of
bodies recovered forty-seven. Many
relatives are arriving at Dover for
the purpose of endeavoring to identify
bodies.
Among those rescued yesterday was
a baby, warmly clad, which was found
floating on its back. The child was
discovered by a patrol boat and was
taken into the engine room. After be
ing warmed it smiled at its rescuers
and seemed none the worse for the im
mersion.
The British press is almost unani
mous in assuming that the Maloja and
the other vessels sunk by mines dur
ing the week end were victims of a
fresh sowing of German mines by neu
tral shipping.
The Pall Mall Gazette suggests that
such operations may drive England to
still more stringent supervision of
neutral shipping.
Russ Ship Sunk.
The Russian steamship Petshenga
has been sunk. Fifteen of those
aboard were saved.
The Petshenga was formerly the
German steamship Erik Larsen, which
was captured by the Russians early in
the war. She was of 1,647 gross tcn3.
was 260 feet long, 37 feet beam and
was constructed at Luebeck in 1903.
Liner Goes Down.
The bodies of eight sailors and the
captain of the Wilson liner Dido,
which was sunk on Feb. 26, were wash
ed ashore today at Donna Hook, Lin
colnshire.
The Dido, a vessel of 4,769 tons
gross, carried a crew of twenty-nine
men. The first reports of her sinking
said that the captain and two of the
crew had been landed by a Belgian
steamer.
DEATH LIST GROWS.
Dover, Feb. 28.—It is feared the
Maloja death list would be well over
ISO! Bodies continue to be washed
ashore and fifty persons have thus far
been accounted for.
The steamship company's statement
regarding the number of people on
board the Maloja, issued this after
noon, showed that of 119 passengers,
nineteen were children. The ship's of
ficers were given as including the com
mander, four navigating officers, thir
teen engineering officers, surgeon
and purser.
HOSPITAL SHIP 8INKS.
London, Feb. 28.—The Binking of the
hospital ship Marechiaro near San
Giovanni de Medua, Albania, is report
ed in a dispatch from Rome to the Ex
change Telegraph Co. The vessel is
said to have struck an Austrian mice.
It is reported there were numerous
victims.
GREEK WOMEN
PLEAD FOR AID
Athens, Feb. 26. (Delayed)— Bare
foot and ragged women in |arge num
bers, many with babies in arms, pro
ceeded from the quarters of the work
ing classes yesterday to parliament,
stopped ingoing deputies and pleaded
that the chamber relieve the distress
caused by mobilization of the men and
nonpayment of allowances to their
families. There was no disorder. Sev
eral .deputies, moved by the pitiful
demonstration, addressed the women,
promising relief.
Little has been done by parliament
this session. Members have engaged
principally tn recriminations, disputes
giving rise to frequent duels. Attempts
are being made to discredit the ad
ministration of Former Premier Veni
zelos. Acceptance by him of candi
dacy for a seat in the chamber from
Mitylene gives added significance to
the discussions in parliament. His
election is assured and there is much
discussion of a possible alteration of
Greece's attitude.
Leaves of absence of soldiers, Inaug
urated last month, are gradually bring
ing about demobilization. The Greek
troops which were stationed In Mace
donia and Thessaly are being with
drawn to old Greece, facilitating the
return of soldiers with needy families
in time for the spring seeding.
WAR LOAN APPROVED.
London, Feb. 28.—The finance com
mittee of the Russian duma has ap
proved the new ten year 5% per cent
war loan for 2,000,000,000 rubles, says

FIGHT TAKES ON
Germans Launch Assault on
Section of Line That
Is Very Near Paris
CARNAGE AT VERDUN
IS PAST DESCRIPTION
Battle There Raging With
Great Intensity French
Crowded Backward
Paris, Feb. 28. The German offen
sive on the western front is assuming
even wider scope and importance. Not
enly is the impetuous drive on Verdun
being pressed vigorously but aggres
sive action on a large scale has devel
oped In the Champagne district where
the Germans have captured nearly a
mile of French trenches.
The new movement in the Cham
pagne is on a front forty miles nearer
Paris than the operations against Ver
dun.
North of Verdun the German lines
have been extended somewhat to the
west, the loop of the Meuse around
Champneuville having been cleared of
the French, the Berlin statement de
clares, while there has been a slight
advance southward in the neighbor
hood of Vacherauville and Bras near
the river.
The French, however, have stopped
the German drive In the Ft. Douau
mont section. Apparently the Germans
still hold the fort Itself but their furi
ous attacks on the village of Douau
mont nearby were failures, according
to the French war office.
INTENSE FIGHTING REPORTED.
London, Feb. 28.—The battle before
Verdun, in which more than half a mil
lion men are engaged, is still going on
.today apparently with as much
violence as ever at some points. The
Germans have captured Champneu
ville, west of Ft. Douaumont, and Har
dauxmont to th6 east. Berlin also
claims to have captured the Cote de
Talou, wedt of Douaumont, but the
French statement says the artillery
fire coming from both sides has ren
dered this position untenable for
either French or Germans.
The French are pouring artillery fire
upon the Douaumont positions held by
the Germans, who are said to be main
taining themselves there with difficul
ty, but in the Woevre region, east of
Verdun, the French advanced posts
have been withdrawn. Both sides are
reported to be bringing up large rein
forcements and the British lines are
being extended in Belgium, in order
that French troops may be released for
the Verdun battle. At many other
points from Ypres to the Vosges moun
tains vigorous bombardments are in
progress but changes of positions are
not marked.
BRIAND WAXES ELOQUENT.
Paris, Feb.
27—
(Delayed)—Impet­
uous counter attacks by French troops
north of Verdun, in which the (Jen
mans were thrown back from many
positions captured by them the first
four days of the battle, according to
reports from the front, are consider
ed as starting a second phase of the
great action under conditions favor
able to the defenders. Premier Bi+
and told representatives of the press
today how the tide had turned.
"Caught between two barring fires,"
he said, "covered with shrapnel from
all sides, attacked by our fresh divi
sions at an expected moment, the
Germans saw their efforts stopped
short. The struggle was titanic. Our
heroic troops went into the melee
frantically. Our light and,heavy ar
tillery dug sanguinary furrows in the
compact ranks of the Germans.
"Finally, exhausted, their ranks dec
imated, the German armies recoiled
under'our furious counter attacks. We
have Regained the advantage. Instal
led on formidable positions our sol
diers remained masters of the battle
field."

Berlin, Feb. 28.—On the occasion of
the last Zeppelin raid over England
two government factories and two Am
munition factories at Birmingham and
one ammunition factory at Bradford
were destroyed by bombs, the Over

GIRL BRIDE SAYS
SHE KILLED
FOR HIS GRIME
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WIFE ADMITS
LURINQ VICTIM TO SCENE
OF MURDER.
Ft. Worth, Tex., Feb. 28.-^0 grand
Jury today began investigation of the
confession alleged by the police to
have been made Saturday night by
Mrs. Katherlne Harrison, IS year old
bride of 20 year old Charies Harrison,
that she shot and killed W. R. Warren,
hotel proprietor, who, she said to have
charged with wronging her before her
marriage. She became the bride of
Harrison December 24, last, two days
after Warren's body was found in a
country road near here.
Harrison and his wife, who were
charged Saturday night with murder,
are at liberty under bonds of $2,500
each. The police today said Mrs. Har
rison told of the killing the morning
after Warren's death. Although the
family Into which Mrs. Harrison mar
ried is wealthy, she has been work
ing as a stenographer since her mar
riage.
Mrs. Harrison's alleged confession
was made, according to the police, to
clear a man held in connection with
the case. Her husband was held, it Is
said, because he was in the automo
bile in which his wife invited Warren
to ride and from which she is said to
have shot him when he left his seat at
her resquest to see if one of the map
chine's tires was flat.

there were fifty men on the job. They
were broken up into squads of twos
and threes. This morning, despite the

STEAMERCEDRIC
SIN PORT ACAIN
New York, Feb. 28—Officers of the
White Star liner Cedric, here today for
the first time since November, 1914,
when she was requisitioned by the
British government as a transport
for troops, declined to reveal anything
concerning the government service In
which the trans-Atlantic liner has been
engaged. Members of the crew as
well as officers said they were under
pledge to the British authorities to
tell nothing concerning the Cedrlo's
war movements. It has been report
ed, that the steamer was used to carry
troops to France, Egypt and the Dar
danelles.
The only outward sign of the Ced
ric's use was the gray paint which
covered her superstructure and the
hinged steel plates that hid her ports
so that she could pass unseen In the
night. All her staterooms were re
moved when she was taken for trans
port service. One row of them has
been restored for the use of her offi
cers. Her huge dining
Baloon
was
used as a drill hall for troops. The
Cedric is unarmed and shows no signs
of havifig had guns while equipped as
a transport. She was released by the
admiralty to carry war munitions and
supplies from this country to Eng
land but is still ready for transport
service when desired.
Local authorities on international
law who asked whether a vessel could
be restored to her former standing as
a merchant ship after having been
used as a war transport, said that the
