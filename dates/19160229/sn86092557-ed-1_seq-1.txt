Pride of French Commercial
Fleet Was Sunk in the
Mediterranean.
French Ministry of Marine
Reports Most of Her
People Saved.
PARIS, Feb. 29.?The auxiliary
French cruiser La Provence was sunk
In the Mediterranean last Saturday, It
was announced officially today. At
Malta 296 survlvorB have been landed.
The ministry of marine estimates the
number of survivors at 870. Four hun
dred survivors were landed at Mllo.
La Provence sank In the middle of
the Mediterranean.
La Provence was one of the largest
and finest of the French line vessels.
Her gross tonnage was 13,753. She
was built at St. Mazalre in 1906, was
602 feet long and 65 feet deep.
She was requisitioned by the French
government for naval service at the
outbreak of tho war. At the time she
was launched La Provence was the
fastest transatlantic liner ever built
In France. She covered her maiden
voyage to New York over the course
between Harve and Sandy Hook in
six days nine hours and ten minutes,
the festest passage by several hours
which had been made between the two
points.
La Provence entered the transat
lantic service when the speed rivalry
among British, France and German
lines was at its height and engaged in
a number of exciting races in one of
which she defeated the Cunarder Mau
retania.
Being a Godfather
Dangerous Business
Although the capture of Oom Paul
Kruger yesterday may be of very
little Importance to many people,
those who try to follow police news
and war news wijl have a chance to
put a red pin on'the war map which
will indicate that Oom Paul was cap
tured in this city. Oom Paul, without
the hoary appendage of the original
uncle. Is in the county Jail charged
with trying to bring all the whiskey
In the United States into Grant Town
without a label. There Is an excuse for
Oom forgetting that It was necessary
for the whiskey to be labelled; he was
to act as godfather at a christening,
yesterday and it being the godfather's'
place to blow on these occasions, he
was ordered to provide the party with
a Garden of Paradise apple.
Oom was captured by Uhlans Con
nors, Satterfleld and Harris. He con
fessed to Squire R. Leigh Fleming that
he wag guilty and was given the min
imum, which will hold him in Jail for
60 days and force from him the pay
ment of $100.
Had Label All Right
But Not in Right Place
Vine Matusevlc, who for conven
ience sake It shall bo necessary to
call Pete Doe, Is in the county jail
today, having been arrested this morn
ing by. Constables Connors, Harris anty
, Satterfleld. Doe, upon his capture, had
three gallons and two quarts of
alochol and whiskey in a suit case,
which at present is in bad condition
from being full of such Intoxicants,
The conMner, on. tho way to the "red
eye boudoir," buret and Is no longer of
'nny use except as evidence against
Mr. Doe. When arrested he had the
label which rightfully belonged on the
suit case, in his pocket. As the law
does not provide that the penalty shall
be less when labels are found in the
prisoner's pockets. Doe will seek him
self a lawyer and an Interpreter andjj
will stand trial tomorrow.

over-day and night stay at the county
jail on a charge of being unable to

E. Merlap may be the gentleman's
name and .It may not?but that is what
It sounded most like when be told
It to Squire R. Leigh Fleming this
morning. E was arrested this morn
ing on a charge of. drunkenness on a
Baltimore & Ohio train. He was
brought to the jail by Constable S. Con
nors and Harris. Ho will stay In Jail

But Owner".Says He Does
Not Know What Will
Occur.
The historic Marietta hotelUs likely
to soon be no more. This building was
built in 1840 and is one of the oldest
structures in Fairmont.- Originally
built and used as a school house, for
the past 50 years it has been used con
tinuously as a hotel.
T. A. Deveny has owned and operat
ed the hotel fop 21 years and during
that time the house has had a fame
that extended all over the state. Of
late years the old patrons have died
oil or been attracted to more modern
places and the establishment will
probably now soon,' be relegated to
the past In order to keep pgce with the
development of Fairmont..
The Marietta was formerly called
the Continental House but when Mr.
Deveny acquired the property the
name was changed to the Marietta.
Luther Nay has for 21 years' occu
pied the same room In the house and
has now moved out From his room
Mr. Nay has seen Fairmont change
from a village with a dusty road wind-,
ing up 111 front of -the-hotel, to the
hitching post arotlnd the corner for
the farmers' horses, to a thriving little
city with paved concrete streets and
a tazlcab stand where the hitching
poet used to be.
Recently Mr. Deveny sold the.hotel
effects and the privilege/of operating
the place to Mike Glumlcich. Mike
has operated the place-for nearly two
years and when he got. into a dispute
with Deveny regarding rent, Mike's
property was seized by the county.of
ficers on a distress warrent, A suit
was also brought agalnat Mike recent
ly by the hblderrs of the mortgage on
bis property SQ.at a Sheriff's sale-next
Saturday Mike's property wllPbe solid
to- satisfy the mortgage. The mort
gage holders In order to obtain the
.property paid the rent on the lease
and It will expire tomorrow. Then
Deveny -will have full and undisputed
possession again and it is likely that
the hotel will nofc be continued.
Mr. Deveny when asked -what his
plans were said that nothing definite
had been arranged as yet, but tnat He
would perhaps build a new modern
department-store building on the cor
ner If a suitable tenant could be found.
Several persons have asked for a lease
on the present property.

Verdun Is Now
An Unarmed Town
PARIS, Feb. 27, 11,40 a." ml? (Delay
ed)? The light for the possession of
Verdun goes on with increasing vio
lence, multiplying the dead and
wounded to a point where the losses
have gone beyond the calculators.
Il ls Impossible to verify how many
reinforcements the Germans have
brought up, but the military critics be
lieve that of the 800,000 men that be-'
gan the attack few will be left at the
end of the first fighting.
Verdun, the object of all this sacri
fice, is nothing-but "an ancient fort
ress," according to authoritlve Infor
mation, and If .the Germans take it
they will find it only an empty shell.
Fort; Douaumont, before which such
a sacrifice In llvps has been made by
its assailants, holds neither cannon
nor garrison. It is six months since
the French, putting into practice tho
lessons of the war, showing that fort-,
nesses are more vulnerable that field
works, "unclassed" Verdun and ail Its
provisions^ arms and munitions ,as
well as those in the surrounding forts
were sent to the front. j
Eighty thousand men and several
hundred cannon wfuid have been the
trophies of the place In September,
1914. Today Verdun Is also not a fort
ress. It hag neither.cannon nor garri
?on,' nor ,has It provisions except .for
the,current .needs,of the population;
The value.of .th^town itself is scarce-'
ly more -.than ;that.;,of an* of the" vil
lages toth^northitaken by the:Ger
mans In the'laat. six days, since it was
never anything more 'than a military
