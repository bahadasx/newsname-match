" SAN DIEGO. Feb. 28. William Alden
Smith, Jr., of Grand Rapids, Mich., son
of l'nited States Senator Smith of that
state, testified at a coroner's Jury In
quest here today that he was driving
the automobile which crashed into
wagon late Saturday night, as a result
of which W. P. Ellis of Los Angeles
suffered injuries which may cause his
death.
Smith, who came to the inquest vol
untarily, declared he did not realize he
had struck the wagon and that he did
not know of the accident until he read
an acocunt of it in the papers the next
morning. While on the way to the city
from the Point Loma Country club, he
said, he was forced to drive onto a side
walk to escape runnin
into a wagon,
His machine grazed the wagon, he
thought, but as there was no outcry
from the occupants, he said he did not
stop to ascertain what damage, if any
had been caused. 1

P. 0. BILL
Present Weight System Is
Displaced By Payment
By Space Plan
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. Over bit
ter, and persistent opposition the house
tonight pased the annual postoffice ap
propriation bill with its provisions for
substituting a space basis for the pres
ent weight system of paying railroads
for carrying mails and prohibiting any
increase in the existing limit of fifty
pounds on parcel post packages. The
measure carries appropriations aggre
gating $321,000,000 to operate the postal
system during the coming year.
The fight against the space payment
plan, long advocated by the postoffice
department and vigorously oposed by
the railroads, was led by Representa
tive Cannon of Illinois. His proposal
that the matter of rate adjustment be
left to the interstate commerce com- I
mission was defeated 79 to 54.
Representative Lewis of Maryland
contended to the last for a 100 pound
limit for the parcel post. He declared
the limit of 50 pounds would 'hog tie"
the parcel service and send up the
stocks of the express companies.
The bill finally was passed without
a record vote. A motion to send it back
to the commit lee was voted down 174
to 13!.

of four valuable registered mail pack

Postoffice Inspectors admitted that
inner poucnes containing currency
consigned to New York banks were
cn the truck and while professing ig
norance of the amount, said that such
consignments frequently ran as high
as $1,000,000 and more.
According to unofficial reports, one
of the stolen Washington packages
contained $200,000; The robbery, the
inspectors said, was done by some one
who had keys, both to Ihe mail truck

Much of Argument Applies

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2S Senators

to shorten debate on the subject of at-
taching an amendment to the Shields
dam bill, now up for passage, the
M vers water power bill, w hich has been
! favorably reported by the house lands
committee.
The Shields bill which would permit
construction of dams on navigable riv
ers from the development of hydro
electric power by private capital, has
been before the senate more than two
weeks. Much of the argument both for
and against the measure applies equally
to the Myers measure, which was intro
duced by Senator Myers as a substi
tute to the Ferris water power bill
which has passed the house.
Provision is made in the Myers bill
for the leasing of public lands as water
power sites: regulation and control be
ing left to the interstate commerce
commission, whence the power: is de
veloped in two or more states.
Applicants for lease would have to
comply with requirements of state laws
for obtaining the right to use water.
Fifty per cent of the return from such
leases would he paid to the state in
which the plant was located, and the
other 50 per cent would go to the fund
for reclamation projects in aried states,
