TEUTONS GAVE DP HOPE FOR llflP
FROM UNITEDSTATK SPHTACUIAR
OPENING Of CAMPAIGN EXPECTED
Was Possibility That Germany Might Rescind Order if the
Allies Would Remove Armament—No Use to
Negotiate Further is Stand.
Berlin, Feb. 29.—The Associated Press Is Informed by Germany's
leading statesmen that the new rale of submarine warfare, which
was announced in the German memorandum regarding the future of
armed merchantmen, will positively be pat in effect at midnight to
tonlght.
At that time the period of warning for neutrals, giving them an op
portunity to advise their nationals not to travel on armed merchant
men will expire.
A FAINT HOPE.
For several days, there has been a possibility that Germany at
the last moment might make a proposal that she would AiitmnHnnm
the practlccs of reprisals and sink no merchant ships, freighters or
passenger liners, without first halting the vessel and patting the arew
In a pliwe of safety, If the allies would remove die armament from
the merchantmen.
It is thought that England night accept this proposal or that the
United States and other neutrals would be convlneed, if England refus
ed. that she had no intimation of discontinuing the use of armament
for offensive purposes.
MIGHT HAVE BEEN OPENING.
This might possibly have given President Wilson proof that the
armament on merchantmen Is not used purely for defense and thus en
able the president to reconcile the two reflecting viewpoints regarding
the impropriety of merchantmen carrying armament, and the Impos
sibility of the United States altering the established laws of nations.
The publication of President Wilson's letter to Senator Stone, how
ever, apparently convinced Germany's leading statesmen that no as
sistance can be expected from Washington in ending the preaent an
omalous situation regarding the rales of submarine warfare and that
it is useless to replenish her stores while a discussion Is In progress
at Washington and Ixmdon.
NO HEW HERE.
At least two of the highest officials directly concerned appear to
be now convinced that Washington has no desire to embarmss Great
Britain in her conduct of the war or to do anything which might per
mit Germany to use the submarine In her warfare against commerce.
EXPECT GREAT RJSSUI/TS.
Newspapers and the German public generally am primed for a
spectacular opening of the new submarine campaign. A reader of the
average newspaper article or a contribution to the papers by a naval
expert might expect to find the columns of his newspaper on Ttium
day too small to contain full accounts of merchantmen sank by Ger

WORST ISSUES
A STATEMENT
Declares He Can Afford "to
be Goat" to Restore Status
of the College.
Fargo, N. D., Feb. 29.—With the
retirement from the presidency of
John H. Worst and the assumption
of the executive duties by E. F. Ladd,
agricultural college affairs became
much calmer today.
A
friendly spirit
of co-operation prevails, and all fa
culty members stand ready to support
Mr. Ladd.
Can Afford to Be "Goat."
After his retirement from the pres
idency, Mr. Worst said: "I can well
afford to be made the goat to bring
the college back to its legal status.
"I consider that the move the board
made in electing Dr. E. F. Ladd to the
presidency as accepting everything similar period of
that I recommended to the members
when I appeared before them several
weeks ago at Bismarck."
Mr. Worst stated that he at that
time asked the board of regents to
abolish the dual system at the agri
cultural college, thereby making the
.administrative affairs of the college
come under one head, which the
board authorised yesterday at its ses
sion.
"Again," said Mr. Worst, "the board
blamed me for giving my appearance
before the members too much public
ity. They declared it was publicity
on my part and publicity at the wrong
time, and that 1 was airing the affairs
of the college and criticising their ac
tions. That's exactly what the mem
bers put up to me. That's the straw
that broke the camel's back.
"The board is now backing me in
my contention but has put me out.
I feel that I am vindicated now on
every legal point that I raised."
Dr. Ladd said that the appointment
came "wholly as a surprise" to him
and Is a "compliment from the board
of regents most highly appreciated."
"I still remain as head of the de
partment of chemistry and food com
mission," said the new appointee, "but

RULE TODAY
Market Continues Nervous,

Chicago, Feb. 29.—Assertions are
that the new German note opened a
way to avert a break with the United
States and helped to rally the price
of wheat. The market, however, con
tinued nervous, and continued to un
dergo wide fluctuations.
The talk of a probable serious de
crease in the number of ships avail
able for export trade acted as a de
cided check on the bulls.
May opened at $1.08 to $1.09 1-2:
July $1.05 to $1.07 1-2. This was fol
lowed by a general upturn to 2 1-S
cents above yesterday's finish, then
