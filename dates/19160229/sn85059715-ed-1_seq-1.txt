ftoaved a sigh of profound satisfaction
and beamed as If he would like to give
three cheers and a tiger if such a
demonstration would comport with the
dignity of his position. It has been no
secret around here?far from a secret
4hat Congressman Brown has boen
.iceably anxious that Mr. Sutherland
should decide not to oppose Brown,
which is what his decision to he n

Brown did not want any of Sutherland's

Mr. Johnston was a member of
Marietta bodge. No. 67, Independent
Order of Odd Fellows, at Marietta,
O. He was a member of' the Patriarchs
Militant, a high branch In Odd
Fellowship. He was a member of the
Methodist Episcopal church at Stenley
Heights. Mr. Johnston had for
many years been a member of the
Prohibition party.
James Johnston was born in British
Columbia, but he came to Ohio
when a young man. He operated a
news stand at Marietta, O.. for a
number of years, and was also engaged
In the harness and buggy business.
A person of sterling qualities,
James Johnston was that type of
man, who lived a conservative life,
and did good by doing so. He believed
and adhered to those principles,
which every good Odd Fellow has
embodied deepest in his heart?
friendship, love and truth. He was
everybody's friend. As a neighbor he
was loved by all. His wise counsel
and advise was sought for, and ho
directed many through life's battles,
who have come out victorious and
.
are now nuinDerea among me uuuwv
fair dealing citizenship of the country.
His life was a lesson of goodness.
and while he lias passed on
his memory lingers an inspiration In
Itself for others to mould by.
Ill for three years, part of the time
an invalid, he was patient in his sufferings,
and while he often felt the
pangs of pain, he was considerate of
those about him. A few days ago
lagrippe sot in and It in connection
with his other ailments hastened his
death.
There will be a special meeting of
the local lodge of Independent Order
of Odd Fellows at 7:30 o'clock

! that he would have a slim chance of
I carrying the Second district again with

' As a corrallary, he figured that he
would bavo a fair fighting chance with
anybody olse pitted against him.
The opinion as to this of loading Re.
publican politicians of the Second dls
triqt, and not a few leading Denm
crats who have privately expresset
their opinion, Is that the condition!
prevailing In the district do not justlfj
any rosy,hopes on the part of Browi
no mntten who the Republicans noml
nate to oppose him; The Second dls
| trlct Is normally a Republican dls
trlct, and it Is the opinion frequentl]
expressed that when Brown carried i
last year he carried It for the las
time. He has always been able to wli
enotiah Republican votes to swing thi
district, but reports are that he wli
not be ablo to do that this year and
furthermore, that he will lose not i
few votes In his own party because o
unfilled promises and the dlssatisfac
tlon that has been engendered by hi
distribution of the loaves and th
fishes of federal patronage.
