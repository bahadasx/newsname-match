CRUSH OF BILLS
CLOSINGDAYS
Kentucky Legislate Must Get
on High Gear for Remainder
of Session...
PXTRA SESSION TALKED OF
AH Administration Program
Except Taxation Measure
Likely To Be Enacted.
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 28. After
frittering away much valuable time,
at a terrific waste of the neonle's
money, in bickering, wrangling
quarreling and almost hand-to-hand
fighting over handling the liquor
question, Kentucky legislators find
themselves with only fourteen legis
lative days in which to consider some
of the most important measures pre
sented to the general assembly.
Nearly 900 bills have been drafted
and presented to the houses for their
consideration but less than a score
have passed both chambers. Solons
are awake to the fact that if this legis
ture, the first of Governor Stanley's
administration, is to go down in his
tory as one which has accomplished
really worth while things, it is impera
tive that obstructionist tactics be
dropped and the people be served,
instead of indulging in a lot of bitter
personalities, charges, counter
charges and bootless investigations.
Legislators who went homo for the
week-end recess are expected to
come back with new determination
after having heard from the people
they represent. There is no doubt
that the citizenship generally, from
the mountains to the .Mississippi and
from the Ohio to the Tennessee line,
want to see some constructive legis
Iation passed.
The question of tax legislation
which has been kept in the back
ground throughout the session be
cause of Governor Stanley's destro
to pass other measures in which he is
much interested, may be brought up
this week.
A resolution, it is reported, probab
ly will be introduced in the, legisla
ture looking to the appointment of a
commission of seven to draft revenue
and taxation Jbills for representation
at an extra session. This resolution,
if introduced, will provide for the
appointment of three members by the
president of the senate, three by the
speaker of the house, and one by the
governor.

Sanai
captured the Cote Do Talou, to
west of Douamont, but, according to
the French official statement, the
artillery fire coming from both sides
has rendered this position untenable
for either French or German.
The French are hurling attack after
attack upon the Douamcrtit positions
held by the Germans, who are de
clared to be maintaining themselves
there- with difficulty, but in the
Woevre region, to the east of Verdun,
the French advanced posts have been
withdrawn.
Large reinforcements are being
brought up probably by both forces,
and it is reported that the Britisli lines
are being extended in Belgium and
France in order that French troops
may be released for the Verdun bat
tle. In the Vosges mountains the Ger
mans also started a heavy offensive
southeast of Celles, but it was com-
the other extreme end of the line
around Ypres, a British attack was
repulsed by the Germans.
Between Soissons and Rheims a

ried out against the German positions,

SHE POPPED
And He Was Game Enough To
Say Yes.
Covington, Ky., Feb. 28. Leap
Year and a telephone switchboard
proved a winning combination in Cov
ington recently when Miss Pearl Ed
wards, 22, an operator at the South
phone exchange, hid her blushes be
hind the "receiver" and popped the
question to Charles G. Warnick, C. &
O. railroad .employe. The romantic
conclusion of their courtship became
known Saturday when friends learned
of their marriage last Tuesday. They
discovered that the event was truly a
Leap Year romance.
"The bride, whose home is at 1024
Scott street, Covington, and her hus-
band
had known each other for a
time. Shortly after tho new
long
'year, while conversing over the tele
I phone, Miss Edwards summoned up
all her courage and "popped" the
question. Of course, she knew that
she was on solid ground, but it took
some effort, and that is the reason
why she used the telephone. Mr.
Warnick never knew just how near
she came to failing at the last minute.
" 'Will I marry you? Just name
'hgday, was the reply given to the'
bride.
"ASid so they, were married last
Tuesday evening by Uio Rev. R. B.
McDanieh pastor Of the First Baptist
church. Tho bridegroom lived at 22
