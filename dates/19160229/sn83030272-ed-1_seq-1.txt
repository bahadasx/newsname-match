"Don't you think," an Inspector asked,
"that the four bagi were probably mis

"No," said Meruit, "I counted them

On thn lock of the cage door the In

In cood condition. It had never been
opened with anything except n key.

wagons and tiucks has such n key. It
was said yesterday that the locks are alt

the drivers of these vehicles nor the
clerks in charge of the mall are armed.

are listed, but It does not show the value
of the contents of thq packages. As the
