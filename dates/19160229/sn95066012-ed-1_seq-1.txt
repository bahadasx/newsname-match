GERMANS SHIFTING
JIIACK EAST
Endeavoring to Squeeze French
out of fortress
TEUTONS TAKE 1WQ VILLAGES
Secure Possession of Manuelles and
Champton, Eleven Miles South
east of Verdun.
London, Feb. 29. Suddenly shifting
their attack to the east the Germans
are making a desperate effort to
squeeze the French out of Verdun.
The Berlin war office announces the
capture of tho village of Manuelles
aiwl Champton, 11 miles southeast (
Verdun with 17,000 French prisoners.
The French war oftice admits tlie
capture of Manuelles but declares thai
Germans have lost 45,000 killed 'a
ti t recent fighting.
London, Feb. 28. Latest reports
from the Verdun district where the big
battle has been raging for a week In
dicate that the German attack has
shifted to the east and southeast of
Verdun.
Heavy artillery fighting continues
on the east bank of the Meuse. where
according to the German statement
today, tho French forces have been
driven entirely out of the Meuse
peninsula formed by a loop in the
river Just north of the Verdun forts
West of the Meuse the enemy's
bombardment has decreased while
along the railway running south
through Eix and Fresnes (between
Verdun and Etain). a new attack has
developed with some success, accord
ing to German reports.
Soma twenty iuile3 west of Verduri.
in the Champagne district, the Gor
.u:ans began an attack last niKht which
ealned for them a tniln - nf KVom'i
fronlj north of Sauain' and about l.W'O
prisoners.. An offensive, irt thjs region
when considered "Irt ?eonunctlo'-rrii
the heavy German attacks easfof Ver-
ciuri, seems to indicate Count von Hari

on the Verdun iprtress' arid instead ii
onueavoring to. break the Frerieh lint
Doth , east and west Of It In order to
turn the position'., t t,r.V-.
This is the same plan as used bv th
Germans in their advance on Paris be
fore the battle of the Marne and which
did not then succeed particularly be
cause of the strong French defensive,
known as Cotes Lorraines, on the
heights east of the Meuse.
The cltuation at Fort Dounumont
which has been obscure owing to the
conflicting statements from Berlin and
fans, is made clear by the French a?-
ternoon communique which says the
fort is closely encircled, meaning, of
course, that it is held by the Ger
mane. .
The village of Dauaumont. however.
which lies north of the fort. Is in the
hands of the French, and this indi
cates the German troops who storrned
the fort are surrounded. The French
communique says the Germans made
several unsuccessful attempts to drive
them from the village.
West of Douaumont the Germanr. m
port progress In the direction of the
towns of Vacherauvllle nnrf ' 'h'm'
south of CotedePeivre, which Is held
by the French. In this neighborhood
the French war ofllce tonight tells of
severe hand-to-hand flirhtinir with rho
repulse of a small force of the enemy
who had succeeded In gaining a foot
hold In a redoubt.

CHILDREN AS CIVIC GUARDS
Publio School Pupil Should Be Taught
to Guard the Trees and Flowers of
Park and Street and Should Form
Habit of Keeping Surroundings Neat
and Clean.
By CLINTON ROOERS WOODRUFF,
secretary National -Municipal league.
"Please pick up that (newspaper yon
have Just thrown away," said one man
to another nt Jackson and Biddle
streets, In Milwaukee, one morning.
"Why?"
"If you don't pick it up I will."
The man who bad tossed his morn-
lug paper into the gutter near the
courthouse thought a moment and then
retrieved the tightly twisted paper from
the street. lie thought a momeut and
then put it In his pocket.
"Again I nsk why you made this re
quest," bo said.
"I ask It of you as one citizen ban
right to nsk of another citizen of our
city," wns tho response. "Have you
not seen the articles in the newspapers
about this being the first of three
cleaning days?"
Tho man who had tossed his paper
in the street admitted that bo bad, but
declared that he thought one moro
uewspaper added to the thousands
blowing around the streets would
mako but littlo difference. Then the
man who bud requested that the paper
be picked up introduced himself us the
health commlsslouer of the city. The
two men a hook hands, and the com
missioner obtained a warm ally in the
"clean city" movement, j
"Wednesday is to be children's
day," said he, according to tho report
;n.a lot-al paperr yU the. aid. of tthe
t luldren we wilt attack the loose paicr
irVbleaf and make thua Hnecjal Issue
tin Wednesday. .Through the pupils
-bfjtbo schools we hope Jo gather up
inpry bit of loosefpaper-flying around
tu strrets nr.d cud Its power of doing
tlamape to the health and beauty of
pur city ' :'
. "When we have the city thoroughly
cleaned we must all assist constantly In
keeping it clean. Tapers snid rubbish
must not be tossed Into the air to be
blown into onr neighbor's yard, lie
cause the next clmnge of wind inny not
only give back to us all the old stuff
we have thrown away, but much moro
for good measure."
1 If, however, the health commissioner
had stopped with his plans for a "clean
up dity" ho would have done a piece
of work of only moderate, very moder
ate, importance, for spasmodic efforts
at cleanliness are soon over and soon
forgotten. It is the habit of cleanli
ness that counts, and It Is this which
farieelng soclnl. workers are "ryiug to
Incplcate. Carol Aronovlcf, formerly
director of the bureau of social re
search of Hnode Island aud now sec
retary of the Philadelphia Snbnrban
.Housing association, with , the co-op
eration of the state department of edn
cation, ha sought to accomplish this
end through tho organization of the
school children as "civic gnords."
It is the legal duty of the teacher to
Instruct pupils in moral conduct. This
Li the idea ut the lmsls of the effort;
ns described by Ihe Philadelphia 'com
missioner of public schools, Wulter E.
Rnugor, and In his judgment to no oth
cr instruction, are they more respon
sive. As n practical example of such
training, children mny well be taught
to help guard the trees and flowers of
park and street nnd keep places clenn
for the sake of public heulth aud beau
ty. It Is In such service that tut
school may be accounted a civic guard
In all activities of the school it should
bo remembered that the school is al
ready organized for public service.
Each school is a unit of a town or city
system and a part of a civic l'nsiltu
tloitf It cannot be made a 6Ubordlnato
part of any private organization, how
ever bcnellcent. It owes its first alle
giance to city, state and nation. As
every resident is a citizen of his town
or city, so every pupil, as citizen of
nis school, is entitled to-an equality of
opportunity in the life of the chool.
For tbeso reasons tho formation or
clubs nnd societies among pupils, not
illrot'tly by tho school and tending to
llsorganlzo the school Itself, seems un
necessary. :
Let tho school, as a whole, assume
its civic duties, co-operate with other
public agencies und let every pupil
share iu Its civic nlms. For special
ands the school will properly have its
roups or committees of pupils, but I
rhey will serve in the name of tho
school.

BABY FOUND SUFE IN CRADLE
British Press Assumes That Liner Was
Destroyed By German
Mine
London, Feb. 28. One of the
swarm of rescue vessels scouring the
ea off Dover for survivors of the
lJenlusular and Oriental liiier Mulo-
Ja, sunk by a mine midway between
Folkestone and Dover yesterday morn
lug, late last night happened upon a
uaby, warmly clud,' complacently
floating on its back amid the icy
waters of the channel. Many hours
of exposure bad left the child un
harmed and aiter It had been wanned
in the engine room it smiled smugly at
its rescuers. ,
The ofilcial death list of the Maloja
disaster tonight was 151, Including
uity-nve passengers, mere was a
total of 411 persons aboard the liner
Only 260 are known to have heeu
saved. Out of the total of 119 passen
gers which included nineteen children,
only Blxty-four are among the survlv
ors.
The British press is almost unanl
mcus in assuming that tho Maloja and
the other vessels Btruck by mines dur
lug the week end were victims of a
fresh sowing of German mines. There
is much speculation as to how these
mines could have been laid. Tho the
ory most frequently advanced is thai
a certain class of neutral shippni
was employed.

Military experts are of the opinion
that with the British reinforced by the
Russians in their advance up the Ti
gris to Bagdad, and the Russians vig
orously following up the capture of Blt-
11s in Armenia and Kermanshah in Per
sia, the Mesopotamian campaign will
come to a speedy and successful close.
The Russian Caucasian army in Persia
is now only 169 miles from Bagdad and
about 140 miles from Kut el Amara,
where General Townshend's army Is
hemmed in.
It Is thought the Russian division
from Manchuria will enter the Persian
gulf, land near the mouth of the Tigris
river and proceed up the river, the
lower part of which is controlled by
tho British.

SIMPLE AMD ATTRACTIVE.
These Have Met With Great Success In

Been Taken Up In Germany and
Elsewhere Rents Are Low and Own

IBy Frank K water, consulting engineer.
New York; author of "Modern City
i'lunnlng ana Maintenance. J
The garden city in its best form is a
well organized development, in which
from 10O to 500 homes make up n unit,
which is intended to grow little If any
larger. When additional demnnd
springs uj) for quarters a uew garden
city Is formed elsewhere, und thus the
identity of the existing one is preserv
ed indefinitely, nnd the resideuts. In the
expectation of spending their lives In
their own homes, have every Incentive
to embellish them nnd keep their
grounds lu the best possible condition.
The garden city in plan should be
laid out in the simplest, yet most at
tractive manner. There being no traf
fic of any consequence the streets
should be planned with the degree of
Irregularity which Insures ehnrm.
Some of the streets should be winding,
whilo the straight onej should hnve
suitable terminals. Each house should
be provided with, a spacious garden,
as It is from tho gardens that such

titles take their name. Such gardens,
though partially devoted to vegetable
raising, should ulso be well laid out
with flower beds, and the whole gar
den city should be subject to such reg
ulations us will insure sufficient atten
tion being given to the gardens to pro
duce the intended uppenrnucc. Grass
plots., tees, hedges, shrub bei-jv .and ar
bors should be in abundance both Jn
the. front and in the rear of the houses.
The neglect of the residents, should not:
lie allow ed to mar the appearance . of
Jieiicjty... ; .' -, ,a -r-, .-(.rnvt
'', fhd houses muy be quite simple and
compact in design, but they should all
lie individual In character, and by no
menus the frightful rows of boxes, nil
exactly alike, which are put up for
workmen s houses In most rural or
suburban places devoted to such pur
poses. :' ."',. ':''"' .
The economical design of the build
Ings and the small expenses for streets
make the housing cost small, so that
the rent may be low or the workman
may in a reasonable length of tinio
become the owner of his own home.
Garden cities should be laid out w'ith
In easy reach of transit facilities,. and
natural advantages of site should be
seized whenever jiosslble to give indi
viduality and chami to the plan.
The sanitary provisions or the gar
den cities should be carefully carried
out, and the details should bo simple,
but solid in construction and as Inex
pensive-as possible. A .'
A ' garden city is principally a place
of residence, and It should havo as
few stores as. possible, only those of
the most necessary character ( being
provided. A school may be the only
building of a publle character.
In garden cities, however, which are
