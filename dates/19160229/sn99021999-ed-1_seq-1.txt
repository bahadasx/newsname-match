Monday for Merchants' Market week.

firms to favor then! by reserving rooms

DOVER, Feb. 28. it Is feared the
death list from the sinking of the
Peninsular and Oriental liner Maloja
will be more than 160. Bodies con
tinue to be washed ashore- and fifty
persons have thus far been accounted
for. I'p to mid-afternoon the num
ber of known survivors was 260, of
whom over seventy are passengers.
Line officials hope it will be found
that others have been picked up and
landed on neighboring coasts. The
company's statement issued this aft
ernoon regarding the number aboard
the ship allowed that of 118 pas
sengers, nineteen, were children.
LONDON. Feb. 28. Of the total
complement of 411 passengers and
crew on the Peninsular & Oriental
line steamship Maloja, which struck
mine and sank within half an hour
two miles off Dover yesterday, only
260 are known to have been saved.
Of the total of 119 passengers,
sixty-four names of persons saved
have been received at the steamship
company's offices. It was stated
there that it is hoped that more
names of persons saved will be re
ceived.
The bodies of three more lascars
of the crew ot the Maloja have been
washed ashore, making; the total of
bodies recovered forty-seven. Many
relatives are arriving at Dover for
the purpose of endeavoring to iden
tify the bodies.
Among those rescued yesterday was a
baby, warmly clad which was found
floating on Its back. The child was dis
covered by a patrol boat and was taken
Into the engine room. After being warmed
it smiled at Its rescuerea and seemed
none the worse for the Immersion, ,
The. British press la almost unanimous
in assuming that the Maloja and the
other vessels sunk by mine during the
week-end ..were -victims -of a fresh sow
ing of German mine. There IS much
speculation as to how these mines could
hove been 'laid. The theory most fre
quently advanced is that a oertaln class
of neutral shipping was employed. i
The Pall Mall Qaiette, suggests that
such operation may drlvo England to
still more stringent supervision of neu
tral shipping than - has yet been exer
cised by the admiralty.
