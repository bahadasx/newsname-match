Germany When Parliament
Reconvenes.
London, Feb. 28.—The tide o£ battle
around Verdun, apparently, has not
turned in favor of either side. While
the Germans claim further advances,
the iFrench arc equally emphatic in
their assertions that they checked the
attacks of the musses of German in­
fantry sent against them.
Fort Douauniont has fallen to the
Germans, but it is reported to be in
ruin. Arounil this position the most
desperate fighting of the battle has
been going on since Friday. Here
French counter attacks were deliver­
ed with such crushing force that
some of the German detachments
viere driven back and one regiment
is almost encircled.
To the west of this fort, in a hand
to hand encounter, the French have
ejected the Germans from a small
redoubt which they had captured.
Throughout the entire sector of
Verdun, except on the western bank
of the Me.use river, where the Ger
mon bombardment has slackened
somewhat, the artillery duels are of
vast proportions.
Champagne Offensive.
To tho southeast, "the French at
Frespes, in the Woevre region, have
put down two German attacks against
that town, but the Germans have in­
augurated an important movement in
the, Chjipipagne district, where by
surprise attacks, they succeeded In
entering French advance posKions of
a supporting trench over a front of
nearly a mile, capturing more than a
thousand men.

It is also claimed that the Germans
have entirely expelled the French
from jbe Meuse peninsula, southward
from SWogneiix, and west of Vach

Austrlans Hold Position.
The Austrians, according to Vien­
na, have put down at sanguinary loss­

on both sides of Monte Sanmichele
and east of the Azzo and also de

Turk Leader Killed.
iFurthcr details of the fighting be­

officered by the Turks in western
(Egypt, show that the leader of the
tribesmen, Muri Bey, a brother of the
Turkish war minister, was killed, and
his principal subordinate wounded,
and that the tribesmen left large
numbers of dead and wounded on the
field, as their main force fled.

RAIL POUCHES ARE
ROBBED OF CURRENCY
New York, Feb. 28.—The robbery of
four valuable registered mail pack­
ages in what appears to have ibeen
an attempt to steal at least $1,000,000
in currency consigned to New York
bank3, became known here today.
The robbery occurred Saturday
morning, when a United States mail
automobile truck was entered while
it was on a ferry bound from the
Central station of the "New Jersey
flail road station at Communipaw, iff.
J., to Liberty street. New York.
The packages were stolen from
mail pouches, three of which were
from Washington and one from Baliti
more.
Postoffice inspectors admitted that
other pouches containing currency
consigned to New York banks were
on the truck, and said that such con­
signments frequently ran as high^as
$1,000,000, and more. It is believed
that this currency was the booty
sought.
According to unofficial reports, one
of the stolen Washington packages
contained 9200,000.
The robbery, the inspectors said,
was dime by someone who had keys
both to the mail truck and the pouch­
es.
Wheat Takes

Chicago, Feb. fcS.-kteruiany's refus­

at $1.06 il-4, representing total losses
of 1'9 cents a bushel since the begin­

THESE MAY ALTER
STAND OF WILSON
Washington, Feb. 28.—Germany, in
a formal note presented by Count
von Bernstoiff to Secretary Lansing
today, reiterates assurances regard­
ing the future conduct of submarine
warfare, given in the Lusitania case,
and declares those assurances have
not been modified by the memoran­
dum setting forth its intention to
treat armed merchantmen of the En­
tente allies as auxiliary cruisers after
midnight tomorrow.
The note attempts to justify the is­
suance of the latter memorandum by
presenting evidence and assertions
designed to prove that the British
government has instructed merchant­
men to use their armament for pur­
poses of attacks in violation of as­
surances given to the United States.
Later it was said at the state de­
partment that, while the United
States stood unalterably for the right
of a merchantship to carry guns for
defense, it was not now and never
had been contending that Americans

BRUEW8CITY
Williston, N. D., Feb. 28.—In fur­
therance of the candidacy of :H. IH.
Perry of Ellendale for the position
of national committeeman for 'North
Dakota, on the democratic ticket, at
the presidential primary election, sev­
eral democrats of Williston have or­
ganized a "Perry National Commit­
teeman club," with the following offi­
cers:
President—Geo. A. Gilmore.
Vice President—E. ,R. Brownson.
Secretary—V. R. Asbury.
Treasurer—iR. W. Nudd.
It is the sense of this organization
that Mr. Perry is the right man for
this important position, and are, ac­
cordingly entering into an active cam­
paign in his behalf and expect
through their efforts to give him sucfit
a vote in this locality as his worth
demands.
Dr. E. F. Ladd, for more than a
quarter of a century with the institu­
tion, is now president.
'Dr. Ladd was given the position
with the distinct understanding that
he would be retained as the head of
he State Pure Food commission and
of the department of chemistry at the
college, and would be permitted to
give his personal direction to this
work, and be granted whatever addi­
tional assistance would be required.
The dual system in vogue at the
Agricultural college during the past
two years has been abolished, and the
original plan of making the president
responsible head of the institution is
restored, an arrangement with which
Director Cooper most heartily con­
curs.
Dr. Ladd will be held responsible
by the board for the conduct of the
institution.
The director of the experiment sta­
tion and the heads of all departments
will be directly responsible to Presi­
dent Ladd.

The intention of the state board of

The board will iusist on a con

when it assumed its duties, July 9,

It was then too late for the board

The board decided against any
hasty action, preferring to proceed

Washington, ei. 28.—1 elix Diaz,
who has been watched for several
months by department of justice
agents because of suspected activities
in violation of American neutrality,
apparently lias left the United States
for Mexico, with the intention of
launching a new revolution against
the Carranza de facto government.
Information reaching officials here
indicated that he hopes to organize
and lead the troops, of his native
state, Oaxaca, and such oilier forces
in southern Mexico as he can gather
about him.
General Diaz left New Orleans Fri­
day for Havana, where several Mexi­
cans were understood to be waiting
for him. Theodore Dehasha, a former
governor of Vera C'ruz, and General
Aurelicano lilanquet, war. minister
under Huerta, were reported to be
among tlieni.
General Diaz, a nephew of the for­
mer Mexican president of that name,
has been absent from Mexico sine*
Huerta, whom he helped establish in
power, sent him abroad on a diplo­
matic mission.
Oaxaca, where Diaz is expected to
launch his movement, is the only
state that lias held aloof during the
fighting of the past two years.
With the Oaxaca forces as a basis,
it is estimated that Diaz might mar­
shal nearly 25.000, but they woulrl be
poorly equipped and almost "without
artillery. The new movement is not
regarded by officials here as seriously
menacing Carrnnza's government.
POWDER EXPLOSION
KILLS TWO PEOPLE
St. Louis, Mo., Keb. 28.—Two per­
sons are known to have been killed
and about :20 injured, seven of them
seriously, when five cases of dyna­
mite, stored at Maplewood, a suburb,
for sewer construction work, explod
ed late this afternoon.
Approximately thirty houses, most
of them frame, were demolished by
the explosion, and many other houses
were damaged. Windows were brok­
en for 15 blocks.
The powder house, in which the
dynamite was stored, belonged to the
Cooney Construction company. The
cause of the explosion was not known.
A hole 60 feet in diameter and 13
feet deep was torn in the ground by
the blast, which was heard several
miles away.

SELECTED US
C. C. Root as Superin­
tendent.
J. Maurice .Martin, superintendent
of the Huron schools, was elected yes
terday lo succeed C. C. Root by the
hoard of education. Mr. Martin ar
rived in the city Saturday evening
and conferred witli the board mem
hers Sunday and yesterday. A spe
cial meeting was held at the high
school yesterday morning and Mr
Martin was selected to head the
schools at a salary of $2,400. a slight
increase over what, was paid Mr
Root.
It is said that Mr. Root will make
the race for county superintendent
of schools to succeed C. L. Vigness,
who has decided to enter other educa­
tional work.
Makes Good Impression.
Mr. Martin met with the business
men yesterday and in the afternoon
addressed the students of the high
school. He made a very good impres­
sion upon the students, as well as on
the citizens of Bismarck whom he
met..
The ne.v superintendent, of schools
is 42 years of ase, married and has
one daughter. He conies very well
recommended.
He was horn in Ohio and secured
his 15. A. and M. A. degrees from
Otterbein university. He took lecture
work at. Harvard university and has
traveled extensively in Europe, where
he spent live summers in .study, di­
recting his energies especially to art,
history and literature.
His experience as a teacher covers
a period of more than 16 years. In
this time he has made few changes.
In 1906 he was superintendent of
schools at Park City, Utah, and later
served at Hamburg, la. Huron, S. D..
and other places. He has been at
Huron the last four years.
It is probable that 'Mr. Martin will
take several classes at the high
school, so that Principal Bolt will
have more time for detail work and
for the development of a better school
spirit. At present practically all of
Prof. Bolt's time is spent in the class
room.

PACKING PUNT
Equity Men Investigate the Sites
Offered for This Big
Industry.
Bismurck's advantages as a site for
the proposed half-million dollar pack­
ing plant to be established by the
North Dakota Equity society are be­
ing considered today by a committee
consisting of C. J. Lee of Valley City,
P. M. Casey of Lisbon and Anthony
Walton of Minot, who arrived in the
city yesterday.
Messrs. Lee and Casey arrived at
noon yesterday and were entertained
at lunch at the club by Chairman Mc
Donald or the club committee on in­
dustry and commerce. The afternoon
was devoted to a thorough discussion
of the Equity plant, and it was agreed
that the inspection of available sites
be left until this morning. Mr. Wal­
ton arrived from Minot last evening,
and the committee is now complete.
What Is Wanted.
The committee is here to obtain
information on the following points:
Land for plant and yards, etc.,
about 200 acres, with good drainage,
and the price at which the same will
be turned over to the organization.
Water mains to plant approximate
cost of laying mains, and the price
that will be charged for water.
'Electric line to plant and tbe price
of current.
Trackage to plant and the charge,
if any, for laying the same and con­
necting with all railroads entering
the city.
Switching charges, if any, and how
such charges are made.
The amount of stock the city and
territory will subscribe toward the
establishment of a packing plant, if
located in this city.
Amount of stock city and territory
will subscribe, if plant is located else­
where.
What Equity Will Do.
The Equity proposes to establish
a plant to cost $500,000 to be built
as soon as sufficient stock is sub­
scribed to warrant the commence­
ment of the saane the corporation
to be organized on strict co-opera­
tive principles, for the benefit of both
producer and consumer, and for the
benefit of the whole state, with a view
to assisting and promoting diversified
farming.
Fine' Site Available.
Bismarck offers a splendid site for
such an industry in the level tract
south of the Northern Pacific tracks
and bordering the 'Missouri river. The
Northern Pacific already has a spur
track into this plot, and there is a
switching agreement with the Soo.
Located here, the plant would be in
the heart of the great corn and pork
belt of the Missouri valley, and it
would have the benefit of excellent
transportation facilities by river, as
well as the .Northern Pacific and its
several branches and the Soo line.
There would be a decided advan­
tage in a location on the bank of the
river, where sanitary conditions would
be ideal: where there would be an
opportunity to ice the cold storage

The city commission at its meeting

Under the law, one member of the

as yet.
