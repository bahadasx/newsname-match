As a eouseauenee Marshal Smiddv
last night decided that be "would not

until he ha had a chance to talk the
whole matter over with United States
Attorney Hdrace W, Vaughan. - This
tlt'i ision was reached after a day -spent
at work upon the case, durinu which
tho evidence, against the two men who
iiave boon arrested was gona lute with
greater thoroiighue than had .beea
oasible before.
One of the result of this wa the
release of tV. Mtoin, or aa ha insist he
is to be called, W. li. Heligsen, man

prison, charged with violation of sec

forbids the "recruiting or' the hiring
for enlistment abroad" of " anyone
within the border of ' the United
States. v- .

Friends of tha man at once busied
themselves in his behalf, and Attorney
Ueorge, A. Davis was retained to look
after his interests. He secured batj for
tls client and Heligsen wa released
shortly after two o'clock yesterday
morning under HMK1 bail. Later in
the day he. waa re-arrested, when hi
ball was increased to '500. On the
plea of Attorney Pa vis this figure . waa
afterward lowered to $25(10, and the
sum waa supplied by Byron E. Noble,

Most of the paper and a leather

restored to blm last night by Marshal
Pmiddy, who, however, retained a small
' note book containing th names of half

PARIS, February 29. Based on official report v the sUtements
of correspondents' and the acknowledgements marje by many
of the German prisoners taken, it is believed here , that few of the
original force of three hundred thousand Germans,! which had been
hurled against the Verdun lines, are left alive. v The slaughter has
been indescribable and the German attacks, made in many in
stances in mass against-the French trenches, gave the French gun
ners and machine-gun operators chances to mow down men in heaps.
Massive columns of the Teutons have been driven against the
French lines, time after, time, the orders from headquarters being
to Ignore losses so long as ground was gained. In consequence the
front over which the armies have
even the veil of snow fails to hide
the frightfulness of this last and
greatest . of battlefields, a'
Backed by the thousands of
their comrades the German troops
xmred forward for four days in
a torrent of living, fighting flesh.'
Death appeared to have no hor
ror for these men. rThe front
ranks crumpled under , the rain
from the French machine guns
and the rifles of the French infan
cy and the storm of ' shrapnel
from the French "seventy-fiw"
tnd, still the human wave swept
m trampling the dead and the
tiving under foot. j
German prisoners taken in the
last day of the fighting describe
the fire from the French guns as
"hell on earth." Others declare
that it was nothing but'a "fright
'ul massacre' to send troops into
tuch a fight."
In spite of this it took the
French , four days to check the
advance and turn the wave of Teu
tons back. Last night the official
reports were more optimistic than
they have been for several days.
It was' announced that the Ger
mans, despairing of finally break
ing the front, have begun to with
draw their lines from about the
the fortress of Douaumont, four
miles north of Verdun.
It now becomes evident that

French official statement announ

Germans were compelled to leave

advance and are expected to sur

The official statement adds that
the German attacks north of Ver
dun have been repulsed with
frightful slaughter. Here, also,
the Teutons have charged home
with solid columns in the hope of
breaking the French lines by
sheer weight of numbers. In, this
they are said to have failed, as
elsewhere. The reports from the
front say that the loss of life
among the attackers has been
awful, although no estimate of
the number of killed and wound
ed is given. Large number of
prisoners are also said to have
fallen into the hands of the
French troops.
One or the most desperate
fights of the battle has raged
around the redoubt of West Dou

ed as one of the keys to Jhe main
