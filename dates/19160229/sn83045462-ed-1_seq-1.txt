IS FIRST TO BE HEARD
Tells Senate Judiciary Subcommit- I
tee Plan Does Not Conflict With
Constitutional Amendment Idea.
The neerl of granting to the
people of the District some tangi- v
blc part in their own government ^
r\as voiced strongly today by wit- <'
nesses appearing before the sub- t
committee on judiciary of the &
Senate District committee in sup- t
port of the Chamberlain consti- F
tutional amendment, providing for ti
the election of senators, representatives
and members of the clec- >'
toral college, and the Poindexter ii
til. which would give the District C
j-1 _ 11 I &
pr ucie^aitr m uic nuu?c. jSenator
Poindoxter of "Washington, p
author of the delegate bill; former
Senator Blair of New Hampshire and
Hoy C. Claflin, chairman of the Dis- e
trict Delegate Association, were heard.
Senator Poindexter and the repre- "
sentatives of the District Delegate As- 11
sociation declared themselves in favor p
of the Chamberlain constitutional
amendment as well as of the delegate "
bill. They urged, however, the need J
of enacting the delegate bill into law, ^
since this could be done by Congress
without reference to the country for S
ratification and would give to the peo- e
pie of the District a voice in the House e
at an early date.
Delegate Could Give Aid. tl
It wa,s asserted also by the advocates ^
of the delegate bill that the very fact C<
that the District had a delegate in the a
House, empowered to speak in its in- s,
terests, would aid greatly in the final
adoption of the constitutional amendnent
proposed to give the District the D
right to take part in national elections J,
and legislation.
Air. Claflin said in this connection: tJ
"It we. the citizens of the District, ...
had a delegate in the House now, he
could put Into the record matter at- n
tacking the Borland provision adding r
an hour to the workday of govern- 1
went employes in Washington. At pres- tl
ent we must rely upon some member of ,
th? Umiaa frnm "T?l ? ... . ? N
attack the Borland plan."
The first witness today was Senator ir
Pcindexter. who explained the pro- B
visions of the delegate bill. He said ti
the need for a delegate in Congress and
for the franchise for residents of the
District was so obvious that there was o
little cause for argument along that a*
line. He said he had listened to the a
argument of Theodore W. Noyes, in
support of the Chamberlain eonstitu- tl
tional amendment, with great interest
at the last meeting of the committee. tl
P!
Disclaims Any Conflict.
T wish to disclaim any conflict be- e
tween this delegate bill and the con
titutional amendment which Mr. Noyes
advocated," said Senator Poindexter. n
"I am not opposing that resolution."
He called attention to the fact that
such a resolution proposing an amend- tj
ment to the Constitution must be
adopted by a two-thirds vote in both h
toe Senate and the House, and then a
must be ratified by three-fourths of "
the states before it can become efTec- 5
live. |
He suggested that it might take > R
many years, a generation, to get such S
amendment to the Constitution, and C
said that for that reason he believed it *1
was particularly necessary to enact the | c

pointed out that it had taken many j "
jearn to put through the constitutional ; 1J
amendment providing for the popular j b
election of senators, although the 1 c
states were vitally interested in that r'
matter, and said that It might be expected
to taken even longer to put 'l
through a constitutional amendment in ,
which the people of the District were li
vitally interested, but in which the peo- }
pie of the states were not so closely in- ?
teres tea. 3*
He said his bili also would establish
In the District an electoral system "

"WouH it not be wise to forego this ori

Representative Byrns replied that pu

"Should not the heads o* tjie depart- F1

Mr. Ragsdale. "They have that 2

Representative Rondon of Ne w York in

This might possibly have given Presi- '
lent Wilson proof that armament on
nerchantmen was not used purely for
lefense, and thus enable the President to
econcile the two conflicting viewpoints
egarding the impropriety of merchant nen-carrying
armament and the impossibility
of the United States altering th*.
stablished law of nations.

Warning Not Expected.
It is not believed that Americans will
be warned from traveling on armed
merchantmen or that adequate measures
will be taken to see that armament
is used only for defensive pur
poses. German statesmen apparently
hope that by the exercise of a certain
amount of circumspection matters may
drift, along for a time without conflict,
lliat Americans of their own accord
will avoid steamships belonging to
belligerents, and that in such incidents
as do occur it may be possible for Germany
to prove that the ships in question
violated rules of warfare and acted
offensively.
Further than this their hopes do not
extent!.

according to Herman opinion, to be considered
in the light of the facts here
set forth," says the Overseas News
Agency.
"Armament of merchantmen was introduced
and sanctioned under international
law during the times when the
high seas were infested with privateers
and when, during time of war, ships I
were furnished with letters of marque 1
in order to attaek merchantmen of the !
enemy. I
"President Thomas JelTerson express- ;
ly stated that the admission of armed '
merchantmen under the same bonds as
non-armed peaceful trading ships was |
based on the fact that they were j
obliged to defend themselves against {
privateers. I
Privateering: Stamped Out.
"Privateering. Jiotvever, has been
stamped out on the high seas for a
long time. CSreat Britain played a
prominent part in driving robbers from
the seas. The Paris declaration of 1856
abolished the institution of letters of
martiue. thus removing: every other
reason which had been given for the i
firming of peaceful trading ships. ;
Under the present circumstances, j
therefore, the reasons on account of
which armed merchantmen were admitted
on the same basis as peaceful
trading ships exist no longer. Furthermore,
it is a recognized principle
of international law that when the
reason for the existence of a law ceases
the law itself is abolished. In the
present case this means that the nonadmission
of armed merchantmen does
not imply a change of international
law, made by a one-sided declaration
of one or some few of the parties concerned,
but is simply the application of
T
; 7/
recognized principles of international
law."

j lung, calls for the destruction of all
| ships bound for England, whether
i armed or not. He points to the seizure
by Portugal of German ships, which he
says probably will be used under the
Portuguese flag to carry foodstuffs to
England.
The writer fears also that many German
ships now lying in South American
harbors may eventually be emj
ployed for the same purpose, and asks:
Only Permissible Reprisal.
j "Shall we then let these ships quietly
j pass which as unarmed English meri
ehantmen cross the ocean? We shall
have to do so if we hold to the phantom
of torpedoing only armed merchantmen
and of sparing neutral ships in
j all circumstances."
j Herr Bernhard thinks that war should
{be carried out not against certain
'categories of British ships, but against
British commerce on the seas, and declares
that the new submarine campaign
is the only permissible measure
of reprisal "against England's breach
of international law."
If this does not accomplish the object,
which is to prevent the provision!
ing of England, he adds "a deaihblow
jean be dealt England only if we direct
a request to all neutral states to
! be kind enough to keep out of English
j coastal waters for a specified time.
! since, otherwise, we cannot assume re[
sponsibility for their ship losses."
j The leading German statesmen. Herr
Bernhard continues, must soon determine
whether to take this course, and
! he adds: "It is not without risk, but
{the greatest risk would be neglected
opportunity. Moreover, the risk perj
haps is smaller, since the American
Congress shows signs of demanding
tnat the decision in international affairs
be taken from the President's
hands and placed in those of Congress."
