MOKE HIVE llKV Ul.MHMt.s
The atmosphere of the babj exhibit
at 12 North Tenth strest breathes
Kood health and good cheer good
health for babj because sanration is
emphasized in its food, and comfort
in its clothing, good health for moth
er because, dispensing with the un
necessary anities in babj's clothes,
she can now have time for rest and
leisure.
Every garment of babj's apparel
in this exhibit is for practical ue and
comfort Satin bows, laces and frills
are tabooed "What does a dimpled,
rosy-cheeked, healthy baby need with
such canities?" ask these practical
women.
The exhibits are explained to the
visiUng mothers. First is the bath
ing equipment. Thursda afternoon,
bathing and dressing the baby are to
be demonstra'ed Then will be shown
the clothes for the verj small babj
dresses made of cotton crepe to in
sure easy washing and little or no
ironing: petticoats secured on the
shoulder wit htin snaps baby must
be dressed quicklj and his good dispo
sition maintained, six or eight slips
for frequent change no embroidrj
decorates the sleeves and neck, for
"Embroidering takes the time that the
mother should be spending in rest and
exercise," a tag attached to a dress
reads.
Basket Cradles In Aoguc.
Instead of in a clumsy cradle with
projecting rockers, the modern babj
sleeps in a portable basket This
basket can be carried from room to
room or placed on the sleeping porch.
"Rockers," ' the demonstrator ex
plains, "are injurious to bab's health
and disposition If jou would have a
sweet-tempered baby, don't spoil its
disposition bj nervous rocking"
"And what is the other basket for?"
asks the interested mother "Oh,
that's a traveling basket1 Just large
enough to carry the baby comfortablj.
"This style of go-cart is preferable
tn the very short cart which crowds
tile child Some go-carts have no
springs, and the child is jolted unnecessarily.
'Here's the 'kiddy-coop' 'this one
is entirely homemade. A similar one
coild be made in any home It can
be
in
moved to the porch, into the yard
the summer time,, if you wish. The
screens protect from Hies and other
insects. The sleeping bag keeps the
child comfortably warm.
Plny-Pens Save Time and Trouble.
"This play-pen keeps the child in a
restricted space. He is less trouble
to his mother because he is not in
danger of falling or 'getting into'
things not meant for his tiny hands
"The white enameled tray on that
high chair can be washed and Is more
sanitary, as well as being cleaner
looking than a wooden tray.
"You'll notice the difference in these
bottles. The narrow-mouthed ones
art the least sanitary. From I to 5
