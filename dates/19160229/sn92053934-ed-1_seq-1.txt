GERMANNOTE
IS DISCUSSED
WITH CABINET
President and Members Con
sidering Arguments in
Berlin Document.
ANNOUNCE ATTITUDE
Stand to Be Taken by United
States Made Known
After Meeting.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 29. The lat
est formal note from German? regard
ing the future conduct of submarine
warfare was before President Wilson
and his cabinet for consideration to
day. The note reiterates assurances given
in the Lusitania case, declares that
those assurances have not been modi
fied by the announced Intention to
treat armed merchant ships of the
enemy as auxiliary cruisers after
midnight tonight, and attempts to
justify the new policy by presenting
evidence and assertions designed to
prove that Great Britain has instruct
ed her merchantment to use their ar
mament for attack In violation of as
surances given the United States.
To Announce Stand.
Official indication of what attitude
the United States may take regarding
the note was expected to follow the
cabinet meeting.
However, what Is considered by
Secretary Lansing as the all-important
element in the situation, Is a copy
of the so-called British instructions to
shipmasters to hunt for submarines,
which have not arrived from Berlin,
where they were handed to Ambassa
dor Gerard. Pending their receipt
and a subsequent decision regarding
the attitude of the United States, the
Btate department is prepared to con
eider any overt act committed by the
Teutonic submarine commanders in the
light of the facts. The department, it
was said, would not act on the case of
an American who sustained injuries
aboard a vessel which it could be defi
nitely established carried guns for of
fensive purposes.
British Deny Allegations.
It was indicated in British diplo
matic circles that the allegations of
Germany would be flatly denied. It
was said that British masters had not
been instructed-to hunt submarines,
that they had been told to avoid the
craft and that only in event of a sub
marine approaching without warning
were the skippers authorized to use
their guns.
The state department is understood
to feel that the possibility of diffi
culties arising in the near future as a
result of the new German and Aus
trian policy is more or les3 remote.
Officials believe that commanders of
the undersea boats will Take particular
care not to attack without warning
armed merchant vessels on which
there may be Americans.
Lansing Itefutes Statement.
Secretary Lansing today issued this
statement:
"In view of publication this morn
ing of what purports to be the view of
the stale department on the communi
cation received yesterday from the
German ambassador, I wish to say that
the contents of the communication
have not been made public by me and
that any statement as to the views of
the state department on the communi
cation are unauthorized.

Oskaloosa, Iowa, Feb. 29. Contin
ued mild weather today strengthened
the hope of engineers and city officials

day of the ice gorge which caused the
flood relieved the situation and today

Warning by
Wireless Is
GivenTanker
New York, Feb. 29. Wireless warn
ing that a German commerce raider,
possibly accompanied by consorts,
was attacking shipping in the Atlantic,
were received by the Standard Oil
tanker Communipaw, which arrived
here today from Algiers. ,
The first message was received Feb.
17 and was partly in code. It read:
"Abmd calling caaw and reported
being chased by a suspicious ship
which she believes to be a German
raider. Position wch and wmx. Course
west."
The Communipaw was some miles
south of the Azores when this message
was received. At noon a second mes
sage apparently from the same ship
said. "Altered course to wpn and
nna."
The third and most significant mes
sage was received about 8 o'clock that
evening. Its text was: "German
steamer is attacking shipping in the
Atlantic and may be assisted by cap
tured vessels' which she armed. De
scription, 6,000 tons, speed, 15 knots,
combination freight and passenger
steamer. Carries two guns and is pos
ing as neutral."
The Communipaw was the center of
sensational rumors last December
when it was reported that she had
been attacked and sunk by a subma
rine in the Mediterranean. After some
days during which Washington tried in
vain to ascertain her whereabouts,
she put into Algiers and her captain
denied that any attack had been made.

KAISER PUTS
SUBWARFARE
INTO EFFECT
Berlin Refuses to Postpone
or Alter Stand Regard
ing Armed Ships.
EXPECTING BIG TOLL
Teutons Believe Campaign
Will Open With Great
Sinking of Vessels.
Washington, Feb. 29. The Ital
ian liners Guisseppe Yerdl and
San Guilmino at Sew York, with
mounted guns aboard, were or
dered cleared today on assurances -of
the Italian government that
their armament was for defensive
purposes only.
Berlin, Feb. 28, (4 p. m., via London,
Feb. 29, 12:10 p. m.) The Associated
Press is informed by Germany's lead
ing statesmen that the new rule of
submarine warfare which was an
nounced In the German memorandum
regarding the future treatment of arm
ed merchantmen, will positively be put
in effect at midnight of Tuesday, Feb.
29.
At that time the period of warning
for neutrals, giving them opportunity
to advise their nationals not to travel
on armed merchantmen, will expire.
For several days there has been more
than a possibility that Germany at the
last moment might make a proposal
that she would discontinue' practices
of reprisal and sink no merchant ships
freighters or passenger lines with
out first halting the vessel for exam
fnatlon and putting the'erew in a "place
of safety as in the old style of naval
war if the allies would remove arma
ment from merchantmen. It was
thought England might accept this pro
posal or that the United States and oth
er neutrals would be convinced, if Eng
land refused, that she had no intention
of discontinuing the use of armament
for offensive purposes. This might
possibly have given President Wilson
proof that armament on merchantment
was not used purely for defensive, and
thus enable the president to reconcile
the two conflicting viewpoints regard
ing the impropriety of merchantmen
carrying armament and the impossibil
ity of the United States altering the
established law of nations.
Publication of President Wilson's
letter to Senator Stone, however, ap
parently convinced Germany's leading
statesmen that no assistance was to
be expected from Washington in end
ing the present anomalous situation re
garding rules of submarine warfare
and that it was useless to make pro
posals, the only result of which would
be to give England more time to re
plenish her stores while a discussion
was in progress at Washington and
London. At least two of the highest
officials directly concerned appear to
be now convinced that Washington has
no desire to embarrass Great Britain
in the conduct of the war, or to do
anything which might permit Germany
to use the submarine In warfare
against commerce.
Expect Wholesale Sinking.
Newspapers and the German public
generally are primed for a spectacular
opening of the new submarine cam
paign. The reader of the average
newspaper article or contribution to
the papers by a naval expert might
expect to find the columns of his news
paper on Thursday too small to con
tain a full account of the merchantmen
sunk by Germany's big fleet of subma
rines on the first day of the campaign.
It may be doubted, however, whether
the campaign will set, in with such
vigor, and it would be no surprise if
some time passes without an incident
of such a character as to force the
United States to act on President Wil
son's declarations.
Statesmen Hope for the Best
Such, at least, appears to be the
hope of the leading German statesmen.
They have little expectation that Presi
dent Wilson will change his attitude,
even after the receipt of the justifica
tory evidence attached to the German
memorandum in the form of appen
dices, which apparently were not con
tained in the American embassy's ca
blegram giving the text of the memor
andum itself and is being forwarded by

Confesses to Double Murder.
Bowling Green. Mo., Feb. 29. Van

SEVENTYMEN
ARE TRAPPED
IN COAL MINE
Miners Had Just Entered the
Shaft for Work When
Explosion Occurred.
Kempton, W. Va., Feb. 29. Seventy
one men were trappedby an explosion
in the mine of the'Davis Coal and Coke
company near here today soon after
they went to work.
Thirteen are known to be dead, nine
are still missing and 47 have been
brought safely from mine No. 42 of
the Davis Coal and Coke company near
here where an explosion occurred this
morning. The missing men had pene
trated far into the workings and res
cuers who reached the surface at noon
expressed the opinion these men had
perished.
The mine, which is a shaft 427 feet
deep, was not badly wrecked, accord
ing to mine officials. The explosion,
It was stated, was probably caused by
dust.
Scarcely had the men reached their
working places when the explosion oc
curred. Those not directly in range of
the blast hurried to the main entries
and started for the foot of the shaft in
which the cages were still operating.
There they were met by rescue parties
and quickly hoisted. Other rescuers
made their way into the mine and soon
located six bodies. Later other min
ers who had been unable to reach the
main lines of communication were
found and brought out. Four of them
were badly hurt.
METHODISTS GET
POISON BANQUET
SCARE; MANY ILL
San Francisco, Feb. 29. Nearly flftj
guests, all Methodist ministers and
their wives became seriously ill after
partaking of food which is alleged to
have been poisoned at a banquet given
by Metholist ministers in, the Howard
Street Methodist church here Feb. 22.
The first official report of the affair
was made last night to the Methodist
Ministers' association by Rev. Samuel
Quickmire, pastor of the church. No
report of the incident had been made
to the police early today.
The report of Dr. Quickmire re
sembled in many respects the Chicago
banquet given in honor of Archbishop
George W. Mundelein of the Catholic
church recently at which many of the
guests were poisoned.
Most of those who became 111 did not
feel distressed until after they had
reached their homes, although two or
three, feeling slightly ill, were forced
to leave the banquet hall before the
termination of the meal and summon
medical aid.
According to Dr. Quickmire, no an
alysis was made of the food supposed
to be poisoned and none of the suf
ferers was positive which course had
caused his or her illness. Most of the
victims, he said, were of the opinion
that the Ice cream contained poison.
"My wife and Mrs. Paul Smith, wife
of the pastor of the Central Methodist
church." said Dr. Quickmire, "were
among those who showed most plainly
the effect of either improper food or
poisoa."
THE WAR
TODAY
In the Champagne district, by
a surprise attack, the Germans en
tered French advanced positions
positions over a front of nearly a
mile, capturing a thousand pris
oners. The Germans also claim to have
driven the French from the
Meuse peninsula.
What may mean a renewal of
the German drive on Verdun, in the
terrific force which marked the
Initial attack, is contained in the
announcement from Paris today
- that the bombardment to the north
of the fortress is assuming greater
Intensity.
The heaviest infantry fighting of
last night seems to have been in
the Woevre district, south of the
fortress, where the Germans at
tacked and captured the village of
Manheulles. The French declare
that in a counter attack they at
tained the western boundary of
the village, which they now hold.
The German attack, while still
continuing, has apparently less
driving power, while the pressure
is being shifted from point to
point.
Meanwhile the French are not
Idle and are delivering vigorous
counter strokes. When attacked,
their lines in the stronger posi
tions they now occupy are holding
firmer.
Estimates of the number of Ger
mans in the great battle are con
siderably larger than the 300,000
men believed to have been in the
initial operations. Some author
itles now declare there are as
many as 750,000 troops fighting on
the German side.
On the Russian front fighting
is reported from Riga to Galicia,
although no important gains have
been made by either side.
The Russians are pursuing the
Turks who evacuated Erzerum,
and the British inflicted heavy
loss on the Turks on the Tigris
river. The British also killed many
tribesmen in the fighting in west
ern Egypt.
The Ausfrians claim to have re
pulsed an Italian attack with
heavy losses near Monte San
Michele.
Germany has not modified her
notice that all armed merchant
men will be treated as warships,
beginning tonight at midnight.
Casualties of the British forces
In the various fighting areas pub
lished during February totaled
739 officers and 1747 men.
ESCAPES TO START
DIAZ REVOLUTION
Washngton, Feb. 29. Reports today
to the department of justice said Gen
eral Felix Diaz, who hopes to start a
new revolution in Mexico, left the
United States on Feb. 18 on a ship
bound from Tampa, Fla., to Tierra in
the state of Vera Cruz.
This advice came from an agent of
the bureau of investigation and offic
ials were inclined to give it credence.
No details as to the ship on which
Diaz sailed were received.
New Orleans, Feb. 29. Diaz adher
ents said today they had advices that
Felix Diaz landed in the state of Vera
Cruz last week and was Joined there
by several thousand troops. Diaz, it
was said, intended marching to his
home state of Oaxaca to join 10,000
troops to begin his campaign against
Villa and Carranza. Zapata troops, it
was said, would join the Diaz army.
Several million dollars was declared to
have been provided to finance the
movement.

FRENCH SHIP
IS REPORTED
SUNK AT SEA
Great Vessel Sent Down in
Mediterranean 870 Sur
vivors, is the Claim.
Paris, Feb. 29. (via London, 2:25 p.
m.) The auxiliary French cruiser La
Provence was sunk in the Mediterran
ean last Saturday, it was announced
officially today. At Malta 296 survivors
have been landed. The ministry of
marine estimates the number of sur
vivors at 870.
Four hundred survivors were land
ed at Milo. La Provence sank in the
middle Mediterranean.
La Provence was one of the largest
and finest of the French line vessels.
Her gross tonnage was 13,753. She was
built at St. Nazaire in 1906, was 602
feet long, 65 feet beam and 38 feet
deep. She was requisitioned by the
French government for naval service
at the outbreak of the war.
La Provence entered the trans-Atlantic
service when the speed rivalry
among the British, French and Ger
man lines was at its height, and en
gaged, in a number of exciting races,
in one in which she defeated the Cun
arder Mauretanla. ,
ITALIANS TO USE
INTERNED GRAFT
London, Feb. 29. It was announced
in the house of commons today that
the Italian government had requisi
tioned 34 of the 37 German steamers
interned in Italian ports.
Washington, Feb. 29. Announce
ment of Italy's seizure of German
ships in Italian waters attracted much
attention in official and diplomatic cir
cles, and in some quarters the belief
was expressed that the seizure was the
first of a series of acts which eventu
ally might lead to war between Italy
and Germany. Although diplomatic
relations betwen the two countries
have been brokeu off, they are not at
war.
One explanation of Italy's action is
that she proposed to answer the new
Germanic submarine campaign which
goes into effect at midnight by send
ing German owned , ships to sea to
meet the Teutonic submarines. An
other explanation is that Great Britain
short of ocean ships from submarine
activities, wanted to use the ships in
the Italian ports and was urging Italy
to war on Germany.
