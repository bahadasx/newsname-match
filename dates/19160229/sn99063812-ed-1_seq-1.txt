Thu much talked of ordinance pre
scribing a set ot stringent rules for
the conduct of members of tho Ore de
partment was killed Inst night, when
It failed to pass n third reading. An
other ordinance, eliminating the so
c ilkd "ten commandments," which
vere so much objected to by tho fire
men, was then Introduced by Mat
thews. 1 There were several Interlineations
In the first ordlnanco for which there
had been no amendments voted. In-
stead of making the matter uncertain
'it was deemed beet to start with a
t new ordinance.
The former ordinance sought to es
tablish a paid flro department. The
word "paid" Is eliminated from the.
present ordinance, which passed its'
second rending last night.
A chief, nn nsslstant chief, ten fire
men, and Mich other men as shnll be

Applicants for tho department po

Rules and regulations for the govern
ment of the department can be made
from tlmo to time by tho council, and
tho mayor hns authority to suspend
nny "omplo'yo" of the fire department
until the next council meeting.
Tho chief Is responsible for tho fire
dopartmont, its equipment, etc., nnd
la the commanding officer at Ares. Ho
Is also to Inspect city and other pub
lic buildings, to keep a record of fires,
of drills and other matters for tho
council's Information.
Obscene language, altercations and
the uso of liquor by the firemen while
on duty Is strictly prohibited.
The question of choosing a chief
from tho department created a warm
little skirmish. Sheets advocated
this, nnd Strublo said that such was
his understanding of tho talks by the
flro committer. Sheets stated thai
such recognition Is due the firemen,
Inasmuch as they hnvo rendered good
service at no charge whatever.
"That Is not common sense," said
Miller. "Lot tho mayor pick out the
best man from tho applicants. Why
obligate yourself to any faction?

"Tho firemen are experienced In
this work." Interjected Sheets, "and
furthormoie I bollevo you are, not
competent to sit thero and tell ME
I haven't common sense."
"In other words, you would give
the presont firemen preference over
othor citizens," said Miller.
"Tho Idea of appointing a member
of the present department as chief, I
believe, was agreed upon, practically,
with tho firemen, but the charter does
not say this oui bo Incorporated In
tho ordinance'' said Matthews.
"The charter doesn't say we cant,
either," said Struble. "Give the fire

"I am In favor of n fireman for

said Doty. "I don't believe a mayor
would tie his hands by naming an out

Sheets and Miller then harangued,
Miller contending that the mayor has
the power to appoint whom he pleases
as chief of police and for other city
offices, without having to ask the men
under that official, and Sheets retort
ing that those officials were all paid,
while tho firemen are doing their pro
tective work for nothing. Finally,
Doty, Miller and Matthews prevailed
in asking thst the mnttcr be left to
tho mayor to decide, as the council
has to confirm every appointment,
and the matter was dropped for tho

Stone Tells of Need of

It Is probable that many Klamath
county people have noticed the re
cent efforts of the citizens of Rogue
River valley, and particularly of Med
ford, to carry through a plan of road
building between that city and Crat
er Lake, that will add much to the
attractiveness of a drive between
those points. Tho program Includes
hard surface finish to the boundary
line ot the park and tho construction
ot a similar road by the government
from that point to Crater Lake. Now

LONDON. Feb. 29.
-The Germans
have suddenly shifted thelr.attack,
and are now driving toward Verdun
.from the southeast. It is believed
that the frightful losses sustained
caused the kaiser to cease his massed
assaults against tho Verdun forts.
It is estimated that the Germans
lost at least 160,000 killed, wounded
and missing northeast of Verdun.
An Amsterdam dispatch says over
40,000 Germans were killed. Eight
thousand corpses were found on the
Treves. The Cologne hospitals ore
reported overcrowded with wounded.
German prisoners say Kaiser Wll
helin has been active In directing op
erations. They say he stood otx-the
hill north of Douamount, and for Your
hours watched the struggle, despite
snow and rain.
The German communique says the
Teutons captured the small armored
works to the north of Fort Doua
mount, which the French recaptured
in a furious assault Sunday, when
they also retook the larger fort.
In the Woevre region, east of Ver-
dun, .the Germans have captured
(nearly 17.000 French trooDS. and
have taken Manhuelles, Dieppe, Pa
jcort and Blances Campon.
The Paris communique says all
German attacks around Verdun for
the past day have been successfully
repulsed, and that the French troops
I again entirely surround Fort Doua
mount, which has been the scene of
bitter fighting, in its capture and re
capture this week.
It is admitted that the Germans
have captured the village of Man-
' huelles. The troops taking the town
are thought to be executing an east
ward drive on Verdun to force the
evacuating of that fortified section by
a squeeze.
