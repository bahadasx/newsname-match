LIHUE AND ELEELE
PLAY TO A DRAW
Lihue School went to Weele von
Saturday and succeeded in getting
a draw at soccerwith the fast Ele
ele team.
The Lihue bovs, confident from
jjjtheir victory over Koloa, started
out with a rush, but Piincipal
Morse had been grooming his team
for the past week and their defense
was admirable. Eleele had the
advantage of wind and slope the
first half but did not have the pow
er to score through the strong at
tack of Lihue and were kept on
the defensive a large part of the
time.
In the second half, judging from
her strong showing in the earlv
part of the game, it seemed that
Lihue, must win. But here again
the Eleele boys surprised the crowd
by coming back much stronger
than their opponents, and forcing
the playing much of the time.
At the end of the hours' play
neither side had scored and the ball
was in the center of the field.
Werner and Avery acted as lines
men. Next week Friday Lihue school
and High play at High School
grounds, while Koloa and Eleele
meet at Koloa. Both games will be

TO BOOST SPORTS
Will Take Over Baseball And
Perhaps Other Athletic
Features
Practically all of the officers of
the Fourth Regiment (Kauai), Na
tional Guard of Hawaii, met in the
district court room at the county
building last Friday evening and
discussed a large number of mat
ters of importance to the regiment,
some of which were given out for
publication, as being of interest to
the public generally.
For instance, in the matter of
sports it was decided that the
National Guard should take over
the baseball situation. The ques
tion of whether the competing
teams should be organized by bat
talions or companies was discussed
at length, finally resulting in favor
of the latter plan, although that
will mean that twelve teams will
be in the field during the coining
season.
Soccer football will also be tak
en up, each ot the three battalions
putting in one team for a hot sea
son before baseball commences in
May. These sports programs will
be handled by the athletic officer
of the regiment, acting with the

HIGHS AND
PLAY FOOTBALL
1 lie second week of the inter
scholastic series of soccer football
showed some very uxciting
tests.
con
Friday the High School played
the Koloa team at Koloa. The
first period of play ended with i
score of one goal for High School
and it looked a s though there
would be little scoring.
In the interval between halves a
protest was made against the shoes
worn by a Koloa player; two Hlgl
school players having received cuts
during the play. The referee or
dered the shoes removed and the
player left the field and refused to
continue the game, so that Koloa
had to plav the last half with only
ten players.
The Koloa boys played strongly,
however, and succeeded in hold
ing the boys from the county fseat
to two goals for this period. The
final score was- High school 3;
Koloa 0.
John Bush and F. E. McCall
acted as linesmen. Time of halves.
30 minutes.
KOLOA CLOSED A
VERY FINE YEAR
Koloa plantation made a net
profit of $302,191 during the 1915
campaign, of winch amount only
per cent, or $45,000 was paid
out in dtvidends. S257.193 beinu
carried to the profit and loss bal
ance. The annual meeting of the com
pany was held in Honolulu ves
terday, at which these facts were
brought out. In his annual report
the manager also made the follow
ing interesting statements:
"I am glad to report a baunei
yield of 9,501.77 tons sugar this
year, which is larger by 600 tons
than any other output in the his
tory of the place.
Crop 1916.
"The weather has been verv un
favorable during the growth of the
erne for this crop. The dry sea
son lasted till August, so the
growth of the young cane was
checked dining a considerable
time. After the rainy season had
set in the cane gtew rapidlv, but
unfortunately had no time to rip
en. "The harvesting of this crop
started on December 6. We have
manufactured up to December 12,
2,307.1875 tons sugar. The fields
taken off so far have fallen below
the estimate and. unless the quali
ty of the juice improves, we will
get a little less than S000 tons
sugar.
Mill.
"The Mill has done very satis
factory work during the past sea
son in grinding 29.34 tons cane
per hour with an average extrac
tion of 95.57 per cent.
"The new Lihue ditch was com
pleted August 19, 1915. and will
be of immense value for thi-s plan
tation, No expensive improvements
are planned for the coming year."
Hilonian Takes Sugar
The steamship Hilonian sailed
from Port Allen Saturday for Hilo,
taking 42,000 bags of sugar, 70
empty drums and 1350 cases of
pineapples.
