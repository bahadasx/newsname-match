Present Belief.
BIF.LIW Germany. Feb. II via
London, Eng, Feb. 29.) The As
sociated l'-es ii Informed by
Germany' leading statesmen tlat the
new rule of submarine warfare which
n is announced in the German mem

ilmt time the period of warning for,
neutrals, giving them opportunity to
xHise their nationals not to travel on
.t md merchantmen, will expire.
Wilson's Letter Hastened Decision.

t growing inclination ' to proceed
Nlnwly until the publication of presl-
i tit's Wilson's letter to senator Stone.
. Meh apparently convinced the au
thorities that no assistance was to be
xpected from Washington.
German statesmen took the view
ih it the negotiations with Washington
m ould only give the enemy greater
time to prepare for the submarine war
ire They have little hope that pres
nUnt Wilson will change his attitude.
Armlnir Merchantmen Obsolete. ,
Jermany is understood to take the
itw that the doctrine of arming
merchantmen has become obsolete and
iinw is no 'part of international law.
Tt Is explained that the theory of

the high seas were infested with prl

with letters of niaraue Prlvateerlmr
