PENINSULAR AND ORIENTAL LINER MALOJA
It is now thought that total of lives lost on the Peninsular and Oriental liner Maloja, which struck a mine
Sunday and sank within hall" an hour, two miles off Dover, will reach 151. Of the total complement of 411 pas
sengers and crew on the vessel, only 260 are known to have been saved.
The Maloja sank two miles off Dover, in plain view of people on shore. The vessel went down in half an hour.
Half an hour after the .Maloja foundered the tanker Empress of Fort William hit a mine half a mile away
and went down, her crew being saved.
There have been many reports that mines were being put in the channel by specially constructed German sub
marines. Some of them have be<'n laid in the Straits of Dover and some at the mouth of the Thames, a Dutch
steamer recently having been damaged off North Foreland, and the Mecklenburg, a Dutch steamer, being sunk
but with no loss of life.

DEMOCRATS ARE
FACING PARTY ROW
Royal and Jones to Be Opposed
by Mehan and Meyers,
It Is Said
i A split/is rapidly developing In the i
ranks of the Democratic machine in,
Dauphin county. The reorganizes, i
backed by former Mayor Vance C. Mr- 1
Cormick, are to be opposed at the
primaries by a full set,of candidates'
set up by those who follow the Old
Guard leadership in this city and ;
county. The battle for control of the
party machinery promises to be one
i of the bitterest since, the days of the
old Meyora-Frltchey ructions.
The reorganizers picked Howard W.
Jones, chairman of the Democratic j
city committee, and ex-Mayor John K. '
Koyal as their candidates for State :
committeemen. Koyal Is now a State
committeeman. Hoth are from the city I
and tliis aroused the Ire of many Dem
ocrats In the county, who are also sore
over the discrimination shown in the j
passing out of post office appointments, j
As a result Jones and Royal will be
opposed, it is understood, by ex-Countv
Commissioner Patrick If. .Mehan, of
Williamstoivn, and AV. K. Meyers, of
Harrisburg. Mehan Is a fighter and will
doubtless carry the whole upper end
by sweeping majorities, due to the dis
satisfaction with post office appoint
ments there. Commissioner Oorgas, 1
who Is the reorganlzer choice for na
tional delegate is also to have oppo

The orders placed in the last two

to flow into the coffers of the United

tremendous tide' of prosperity, it is

close of the year. It is pointed out
that prices have advanced $5 and $lO
since New Year's day and further ad
