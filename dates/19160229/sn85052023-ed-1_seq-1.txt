REPUBLICANS
IN CONVENTION
Eighth District Delegates in Session
Here Today County Conven
tions Saturday
The Eighth District Republican
Convention will hold its session in
the courthouse here this afternoon at
two o'clock. Prominent republicans
from over the 11 counties of the dis
trict, arrived here Monday night and
the remainder of the delegates got in
on the morning trains.
The sessions today are expected to
be brief and harmonious. It is prac
tically assured that the two delegates
and two alternates from the Eighth
district to the national convention
at Chicago, will go uninstructed in
the matter of a choice for president.
A majority of the counties in the

egauons to OUtnioru anu uuuianuc
where the state convention meets to
morrow. State Central Committeeman Geo.
D. Florence, by virtue of his office,
will call the convention to order this
afternoon. He will also make the
keynote speech of the convention,
J " J. l 1 .T . ,T naA4 I (- 11,V
and it is understood tnat ms menus j
will urge his selection as permanent
chairman of the convention. So far,
3Ir. Florence is unopposed for re
election as State Central Committee
man, and his friends believe that he
will be chosen by acclamation.
After a resolutions committee has
made its report, the convention will
elect two delegates and two alter
nates to the national convention.
Ludlow F. Petty, of Shelbyville, for
mer Collector of Internal Revenue
at Louisville, is certain to be one of
the delegates, and a contest for the
other place is on between W. C.
Black, of Madison county, and J. L.
Butler, of Boyle county, with the
chances greatly favoring Black. Two
alternates are also to be elected of
whom, Butler may be one, as a con
solation prize.
Much interest centers upon Louis
ville where the Republican State
Convention meets Wednesday, March
1 to select delegates to the national
convention. Reports from over the
State indicate that some confusion
may ensue at Louisville. Many dele
gates, selected in the county conven
tions last Saturday, will go unin
structed, which probably means that
they will support Roosevelt or
Hughes men. There were several
splits in the party and several con
testing delegations were named for
the State Convention March 1. In
several counties there were serious
breaks, chief among them being Ken
ton, Campbell, McCracken, Bourbon
and Whitley. There was some senti
ment shown for former President
Theodore Roosevelt in a few of the
counties. In Bell county a motion
to have the county's vote cast for the
Bull Moose leaders for the Presiden
tial nomination was voted down. In
Letcher county there was also some
sentiment for the former Republican
leader, but the delegation was sent
uninstructed. In Hancock county,
the delegation wasx instructed to vote
for Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court Charles E. Hughes, or Theo
dore Roosevelt after casting a com
plimentary vote for Charles W. Fair
banks. It now seems probable that eight
delegates-at-large will be sent from
Kentucky to the National convention,
in order to placate certain leaders,
and if this is done, George W. Gen
try, the colored leader of Stanford,
may be sure of a place on the dele
gation, for which Phil Brown, a ne
gro editor of Hopkinsville, is giving
him a hard fight.

CONVEN-
TION.
The Lincoln county Republican
convention Avas a most harmonious,
or "cut and dried" affair as demo
crats viewed it, here, Saturday af
ternoon. Delegates were named to
the Eighth district, convention, which
is meeting here today, and were left
uninstructed on all matters except
the candidacy of George W- Gentry,
the well known colored leader of this
city, who wants to go as one of the
"Big Four" from Kentucky to the
.Republican National Convention at
Chicago. Resolutions as usual con
demnatory of the democratic nation
al -and state administrations were
adopted, and every good republican
in the county was made a delegate
to the district convention. The
county committee was re-organized,
the convention recommending the re
election of Dr. R. L. Davison as
chairman of the committee.
Dr. R. L. Davison, county chair
man called the convention to order in
.the county court room, which was
well filled with republicans, about
equally divided between white men

call for" the convention, and was
unanimously elected chairman of the
convention with E. G. Baugh as sec

TO CINCINNATI MAY FESTIVAL
Pupil Will Be Sent Who Makes High
est Music Average for Year.
The Mozart Club made its second
appearance before the public in an
American Recital given in the High
School Auditorium last Friday eve
ning. The program was a most en
joyable one from beginning to end,
and a delighted audience greeted
each number with a round of ap
plause. Miss Gertrude Gaines, pres
ident of the Club, delivered an ad
dress in a most pleasing manner.
This was followed by the report of
the Secretary, Miss Nellie Wilson
Hill, in which she reated the achieve
ments of the Club and its hopes and
ambitions for the future, one of
which is to purchase a Victrola for
the school. All the members re
sponded to Roll Call with beautiful
musical thoughts. Misses Frances
Embry, Annie VanArsdale Craig
and Annette Wearen delighted the
audience with well rendered piano
numbers. Miss Mary Bailey sang
very sweetly, "Rose on the Bud."
Miss Jean Paxton told very enter
tainingly and instructively, "What
American High Schools May Do to
Encourage a Wider Musical Cul
ture." Miss Matsy Grimes read the
Club Paper prepared by Miss Anne
Green Wood, which sparkled with
wit and humor. Miss Bailey and
Mr. Shirley Gover sang a beautiful
vocal duet, "Absent." The piano du
ets "Alpine Storrri," by Misses Nancy
Katherine McKinney and Annette
Wearen and the violin solo by Mr.
Clarence Singleton accompanied on
the piano by Misses Matsy Grimes
and Nellie Wilson Hill were thor
oughly enjoyed. The grand climax
was reached in a number in which
all the club members took part. The
proceeds of this recital will be used
to send to the May Festival in Cin
cinnati the pupil who makes the high
est average for the year, in a musi
cal examinations.
Enough can not be said in praise
of Miss Ballou's untiring efforts to
raise the standard of music in Stan
ford and the auditorium should be
full to overflowing at each recital
not only for the encouragement of
teachers and pupils, but for the ben
efit that is to be derived from an eve
ning of good and uplifting music.
There is no better way in which
America can give to her children
both knowledge and appreciation of
the best music than through the pub
lic school. "

Greene charged that liquor lobby

BIG CROWD AT LANCASTER.
A large crowd attended Lancaster
court .Monday, but business was not
overly brisk. There were lots of
mules on the market and while many
of them sold, the prices were hardly
up to those of several weeks ago.
James I. Hamilton sold 28 hybrids
at an average of $128 and W. B.
Burton a half dozen or so at $135.
The latter also sold eight or ten
horses, rather ordinary ones, at an
average of $105. M. S. Baughman,
of this county, bought of Mr. Hamil
ton a pair of good four and five-year-old
mules for $342.50. W. R.
Cook, of Garrard, bought of Mr. Tu
dor a pair of four-year-old horse
mules for $300. W. B. Burton sold
a pair of aged mules for $150, and a
pony for $97. There were probably
125 cattle on the market, but cattle
men did not go out to the pens, due
to some extent to the bad weather.
"Uncle Jimmy" Roberts, of Pulaski,
had the best pen. He disposed of a
bunch of calves at $26, six heifers at
$31 and 10 yearlings at $35. A few
choice two-yeai-olds belonging to a
Boyle county man brought 7 l-2c.
Butcher stuff was slow at 4c to 5c.

JOINT C. E. MEETINGS
Held
at Christian Church, With
'Temperance" as Subject.
The joint meeting of the Presby
terian and Christian Endeaor Socie
ties at the latter church Sunday night
proved a very interesting one. Sam
Embry, Jr., was chairman of the
meeting, and presided with much
dignity and verve. A number of ap
propriate songs were sung by the
large choir. Misses Josephine Car
penter and Annie Rogers Powell and
Messrs. Wililam Yeager and Shirley
Gover favored the audience with a
beautiful vocal rendition of "Drift
ing," and Misses Mary Bailey and
Frances Embry gave the pretty duet,
"Somebody Cares," in a most credi
table way. The subject of the eve
ning was "Temperance," and Mes
srs. P. M. McRoberts and J. B. Pax
ton and Revs. D. M. Walker and P.
L. Bruce discussed the question, tell
ing of the best methods of fighting
the liquor traffic and doing away
