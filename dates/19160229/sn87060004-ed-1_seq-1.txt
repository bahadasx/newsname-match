Washington's Fare
well Address
Following the usual custom
"Washington's Farewell Address"
was read before Congress.on the great
man's birthday. Either ' the docu
ment is getting a little state, or the
spirit of appreciation is running
down, since it was necessary to in
voke the rules threetimes in order
to keep a quorum on the floor of the
House. But George Washington
was used to being snubbed in his
life time, and a real estate ' dealer h
reported to have told him that he
would "never have amounted to
anything, if he had not married a
rich widow." So, if his spirit was
hovering over the Capitol on the
twenty-second, there likely was no
feeling of resentment.
