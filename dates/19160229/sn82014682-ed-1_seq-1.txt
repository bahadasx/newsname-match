the United States on certain matters
renders an extra, session of the legis

That if local exigencies imperative

when all the items are placed before
him, call, one.
Every department territorial and

which carry legal con&equences.
. . If these have been disregarded and
consequences ignored, no law that can
be enacted will be obeyed, hence1 the
situation could be easily repeated.
The governor will not reach hasty
conclusions and will as heretofore
take non-partisan advice.

Country Likes Policy
SEES NO ' PROSPECT OF
PROSPERITY DECLINE
Believes Europe's ' Orders for
Implements of Peace Will
Equal! Munitions Trade
Between ; intervals of chucking
dimes to the diving boys alongside
the Matsonla. and remarking at the
beauty of Honolulu's bills and palis,
David I. Walsh, former governor, of
Massachusetts, . this morning said
Roosevelt has been gaining much
strength in the East in the last three
months, but that the great mass of
the people are still loyal to President
Wilson as the next presidential pos
sibilitr, "Htfghes is very much talked-of in
the .East, but there is uncertainty as
to; whether he will or will, not be a
capdlditeV said Mr. Walsh. "Roose
velt, is strong among the. Progressive
element of the Republicans, and also
in the pillar-to-post element who have
not agreed on any leader."
The former. governor : sajs .Roose
velt's galnirig: popularity is , largely
due to his outspoken opposition to
the admiuistfation's. foreign policies.
He has gotten together a following
of ; th e d tesatisf ied elemen t who m ant
to unite oft al common opponent" he
stated. V, ; ' ' v '
Patience l,fjipular, .N -
rTtnIfaOTilhisi TiowcTcr, It sebms
to. me , there iss a strong underlying
sentiment in favor of President Wil
son's policy of patience and gr?at cau
tion. His success so far in keepiug
us Qfjt war has gained him a much
larger popularity than is generally ap
precialed, "especially vin the state
where women vote. Toe ' California
press seems -to think the women vote
much Inclined toward the president.'
.That preparedness will not become
a party, slogan was the opinion of the
Massachusetts statesman, who paid
the queston is one of patriotism rath
er than party, and that all the war
ring elements are united to work to-'
gether along this line.
Speaking of business conditions in
the eastern states; Mr.. Walsh said'
"Business : was never so great as in
the eastern part of the XTnited States
at present Labor is in daman1.,
wages are increased and so much
money has never been mad befo'e.
Our prosperity" is marvelous.'
No Let-Up to Good Times.
The Massachusetts' man was not
Inclined to believe that the. cessation
of the European war - will me tn a
panic or setback of manufacturing in
this country. "We feol that the pe
riod cf reconstruction which wilf en
sue when the European conflict comes
to an end will necsssltite the pur
chase from the United States of just
as many materials of peac- as the
amount of war supplies we are now
selling the warring countries. Ei rope
will seek unlimited quantities of ma
chinery and supplies with vhl-h to
rebuild herself." .
Mr. Walsh says he is going :m from
Honolulu to tlie Philippines. China and
Japan to observe particularly in the
Philippines whether the Filipinos are
ready for the independence promised
them by the Jones bill. He will study
economic and political conditions in
the Orient
The former governor w s met off

riam, who-knew him in Fitchburg
when be was practising law In the
Massachusetts city. D. H. Merriam is
visiting his brother here. Judge A. A.
Wilder was also off port to meet Mr.
Walsh. :
Mr. Walsh was 33 years old when
