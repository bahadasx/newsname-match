International Neu S'erYlre:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29. Great
Britain will take sharp issue with
the German contention that her
merchant vessel are submarine
h unters. It was learned at the em
bassy today that P'ngland will make
otlicial denial of the allegations con
tained in the appendices to the Ger
man note announcing that armed
merchantmen will be sunk without
warning commencing at midnight
tonight which say that the admiralty
has ordered merchant captain to
sink submarine, on sigh'.
Already Ambassador P3ge in 1on
lon has len assured ly Sir Ldward
Grey the German charges are false,
while Ambassador Spring- Rice has
informally expressed siiailar views
to See'y of State Lim-dng here.
Meanwhile the state department
han started a search for tne missing
appendices. Ambassadcr Gerard has
been asked how the pojch contain
ing the documents was routed. The
sagegstinn bv the German ernha-ssy
that tlie documents were confiscated
by the British authorities from the
mail rarRn of the liner N'ieuxv Am
sterdam ore not accepted at the de

delay may be due to the desire to

linT.eful that this x.ill not happen.
But it is admitted tr.at there are
many American cition 'prviiiR in
the treus of tramp merchantmen
whose lives until' be jeopardized
should their ship-- be sunk without
warning. But assurances have been
ixen by the Teutonic governm nts
that their submarine commanders
hae been ordered t be very care

that Americans e uil travel indis

Resignation to Go Into Effect

by the Board.
I j. J. Montgomery Tuesday ten
dered his resignation as superintend

school board, practically bringing to
an end the school controversy which
started over two weeks ago when
F. B. Kupel and William ('lern, ma

for next year. The resignation was
duly accepted by the board, A. I.
Hubbard, whoso resignatiem as pres
ident of the board takes effect Tues
day night, signing the acceptance
along with Mr. Itupel ami Mr.
Clem.
.Mr. Montgomery's action probably
v ill stop all agitation on the part of
the; public to get a hearing in his
behalf fron Mr. Kupel and Mr.
Clem. Five hundred petitions that
were being printed Tuesday for gen
eral circulation among the public,
aking that a tribunal hear the
school controversy, were c ince lled.

r.f the resolutions committee which
was in charge of the petitions prob
ably will be held tonitcht or Wednes
day morning. Wednesday noon's
meeting was to have, been for the
purpose, of naming lieutenants to
take the petition into every precinct
of every ward in the city to get tbe
names of as many taxpayers as pos
sible signed to it.
Mr. Montgomery's action was un
expected, even by the school board,
according to Mr. Kupel. A special

STATE DEPARTMENT
SEEKS NEW TREATY
Is Expected to Provide For
Absolute Police Control
of Cities of Poi
ama and Colon.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Feb. 1:9. The
United states is preparing to take
steps that will safeguard its rights
in the event of any "foreign power"
securing coneeyslems that might
threaten tlie Panama canal. And
if the negotiations that have been
initiated for a new treaty with Pan
ama arc consummated, the strongest
defenses in the world cr.n be erected
on the ocean sides ef the big water
way. The proposal to negotiate a new
treaty with the isthmian republic
follows the expose of the $1S00 0.
Cno land scandal re ently explained
to the house interstate commerce
commission by Maj. Gen. Georg' W.
Goe thals, governor of the canal zone.
At the request of the a diuinistration
legislation proposing to put an end
to the mulcting ef the I'nited States
by land claimants at Panama have
Keen held up in tlie house pending
negotiations for a new treaty.
Ind in t-eary.
In addition to covering tlie aeip-i
sition ef land in tlie present 10-n.l
eana'i strip, the m-w treaty probably
will include plans fur turning over
to this government lands enitsLl of
the present canal zone. These laneis,
military authorities contend, are ab
solute ly necessary to protect the
canal from agtrres.sive jiction by a
"foreign nation" which might secure
eontrol of one of the islands in the
Caribbean sea, ami from such'an
island base menace the canal. The
extensive defensive fortilications
outside of the present zone arc ab
solutely imperative, the military ad
visers of the administration declare
if t le .one is to be properly pro
tected. The' new treaty also is expected to
proxide for the absolute pedioe cou
rol by the Fnited States of the
cities of Panama and Colon at the
eastern and western extremities of
the e-anal.
These two citie. military authori
ties declare, edler a constant oppor
tunity to any foreign power to se
cure a secret foothold xhih in time
of war would enable theuu to ruin
the usefulness of the canal.
Measure i- Offered.
Wiifii Maj. Gen. (Joethals laid be
fore the inte'fstate ooniuie-ice com
mittee evidence that the Fnited
Slates was "being robbed" under
tlie present treaty. K p. Adamson of
Georgia, chairman of the commit
tee, took a hand in the matte-r. II1
introduced a bill providing that the
activities of the Panama joint land
commission should cease at the end
of six month-;. lie laid hi bill,
with the information be had ac
quired as to general conditions in
Panama before Pn-s't WiKon. The
president suggested tha the entire
matter be referred to the ."täte de
partment to determine whether any
pending diplomatic negotiations
might te disturbed by such legisla
tion. Today Hep. Adamson was re
quested by S c'y of S'ate tansing to
defer any notion on his bill tempor
arily at least.
Administration diplomatic officials
believe" that tlie expose of conditions
in Panama brought about through
Hep. Adamson's investigations have
made it imperative 1 1 1 t remedial
measures be taken at once. It is
understood, however, that the state
department would prefer to settle
the matter through diplomatic
channels by a new treaty rather
than have congress pas legislation
which would precipitate a conflict
between this country and the new
republic on the isthmus
