BATTLE AT
While Germans Claim Further Advances, They Are
Flatly Cpntradicted by the French
DESPERATE FIGHTING
Fort Has Fallen to the Germans, But is Reported to. be in
Ruins French Counter Attacks Were Delivered With
Such Force That Some of the German Detachments
Were Driven Back Throughout the Entire Sector of
Verdun, Except on the Western Bank of the Meuse River,
the Artillery Duels Are of Vast Proportions Austro
Hungarians Repulsed by Russians in Galicia.
The tide of battle around Verdun
has not apparently flowed in favor

of having checked the attacks of the
masses of German infantry sent
against them.

Germans, but is reported to be in
: ruins. Around this position the most
desperate fighting of the battle has
been going on since Friday. Here
French counter-attacks were delivered
With such crushing force that some of
the German detachments were driven
back and cne regiment is almost en
circled. "West of this fort, in a hand-to-hand
encounter, the French have
ejected the Germans from a small re
doubt which they had captured.
Throughout the entire sector of "Ver
dun, except on the western bank of
the Meuse river, where the German
bombardment has slackened some
what, the artillery duels are still of
vast proportions. To the southeast
the French at Fresnes in the Woevre
region, have put down two German
attacks against that town, but the
Germans have Inaugurated an impor
tant movement in the Champagne dis
trict, where by a surprise "attack they
succeeded in entering French ad
vanced positions of a supporting
trench over a front of nearly a mile,
capturing more than a thousand men. i
Notwithstanding the fresh reserves
which the French have thrown into
the fray at Fort Douaumont, the Ger
man war office declares that their ef
forts have been fruitless and that the
Germans have advanced their lines to
ward Bras and Vacherauville. It is
also claimed that the Germans have

GERMANY'S FUTURE CONDUCT
OF SUBMARINE WARFARE
Will Stand by Assurances Given in
Lusitania Case, But Will Treat Arm
ed Merchantmen as AuxiliaryCruisers
Washington, Feb. 28. Germany, in
a formal note presented by Count Von
Bernstorff to Secretary Lansing today,
reiterates assurances regarding the fu
ture conduct of submarine warfare
given in the Lusitania case; declares
those assurances have not been modi
fied by the memorandum setting forth
its intention to treat armed merchant
men of the entente allies as auxiliary
cruisers after midnight tomorrow, and
attempts to justify the issuance of
the memorandum by presenting evi
dence and assertions designed to prove
that the British government has in
structed merchantmen to nse their
armament for purposes of attack in
violation of assurances given to the
United States.
Later it was said at the state depart
ment that while the United States
stood unalterably for the right of mer
chant ships to carry guns for. defense,
it was not now and never had been
contending that Americans could travel
with immunity on ships having orders
to act offensively. It was indicated
that, although Secretary Lansing was
not prepared at this time to accept as
conclusive the allegations of Germany
m regard to the confidential instruc
tions claimed to have been given to
British sea captains, if the claims were
sustained the fact would have an im
portant bearing upon the future atti
tude of this government. It is felt in
high official quarters here that the
question of motive is the cardinal con
sideration in determining the difference
between defensive and offensive arm
ament. BIG INCREASE IN COST
1 OF MARINE INSURANCE
Caused by Recent Sinking of Ships by
Floating Mines.
London, Feb. 2S, 4.20 p. m. The
recent heavy losses in shipping, espe
cially during the week end, from float
ing mines and other causes, have re
sulted in a stiffening of insurance
rates. Underwriters kist week quoted
rates on shipping to the continent
which were almost prohibitive. To-
day's figures for East Coast
traffic
show an increase from 10 shillings to
20 shillings per cent.
Insurance for Mediterranean and
other voyages have not changed great
ly, altnougn there is more hesitation
than heretofore in accepting risks. This
is probably due to the fear of freh
submarine' activity beginning March 1.
when the German and Austrian decree
concerning treatment of armed mer
chantmen as warships takes effect.

ernor. The picture was published in

that of the anarchist. The identifi
cation was made today upon receipt
of Crones' picture from Chicago.

SENATE DEBATING
THE SHIELDS DAM BILL.
Myers Water Power Bill Attached as
an Amendment.
Washington, Feb. 28. Senators In
terested in legislation for the devel
opment of water power planned today
to shorten debate on the subject by
attaching as an amendment to teh
Shields.. dam. bilL now up for passage,
the Myers water power bUL- which
has been favorably reported by the
public lands committee.
The Shields bill, which would permit
construction of dams on navigable
rivers for the development of hydro
electric power by private capital, has
been before the senate more than two
weeks.
Much of the argument both for and
against the measure applies equally
to the Myers measure, which was in
troduced by Senator Myers as a sub
stitute to the Ferris water power bill
which has passed the house.
Provision i3 made In the Myers bill
for the leasing of public lands as wa
ter power sites, regulation and con
trol being left to the Interstate Com
merce commission when the power is
developed in two or more states.
Applicants for leases would have to
comply with requirements of state
laws for obtaining the right to use
the water. Fifty per cent, of the re
turn from such leases would be paid
to the state in which the plant was
located and the other 50 4r cent
would go to the fund for reclamation
projects in arid states.

Dover, Feb. 29, 2.83 a. m. The su

CALLS FOR DESTRUCTION OF
SHIPS BOUND FOR ENGLAND
George Bernhard Would 8ink All,
Armed or Unarmed.
Berlin, via London Feb. 28, 10 55 p,
m. George Bernhard In a leading ar
ticle in the Voeslsche Zeltung calls foi
the destruction of aU ships bound for
England, whether armed or not. H
points to the seizure by Portugal ol
German ships, which he says will
probably be used under the Portu
guese flag to carry foodstuffs to Eng
land. The writer fears also that many
German ships lying in South Ameri
can harbors may eventually be em
ployed for the same purpose and asks:
"Shall we then let these ships quiet
ly pass, which as unarmed English
merchantmen cross the ocean? We
shall have to do so If we hold to ths
phantom of torpedoing only armed
merchantmen and of sparing neutra
ships In all circumstances."
Herr Bernhard thinks that wal
should be carried out not against cer
tain categories, , of ".British,, ships, but
against British commerce on the seas
and declares that the new subma
rine campaign Is the only permissible
measure of reprisal "against Eng
land's breach of International law." .
If this does not accomplish the object,
which Is to prevent the provisioning
of England he adds, "a death blow
can be dealt England only ir we di
