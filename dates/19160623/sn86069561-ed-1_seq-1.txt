What Is "Good Will?"
You've often heard that the "good
will tf of a certain buisiness was worth a
lot of money.
But did you ever stop to think what
" good will" means ?
Let's use our store as an example.
We have customers, many of them, who
wouldn't think of buying anywhere else.
They come back to us, season after season,
because they get what they want at the
prices they want to pay.
And it's this continuous patronage that is one of
our biggest assets. That's why we carry merchandise
of high quality and do our best to please everybody
who comes in.
Maybe you're already on our " good will " list.
Come in anyhow and see our new lines for Spring.

Catlin. Some party or parties
broke into the house of Mrs.
Emma Jones, last week while she
was visiting her daughter, near
Stanford, and took almost all she
had, including her dishes, grocer
ies and bedding, it is bad enough
to take from tLose that are able to
work and can get more, hat when
people will enter the house of a
widow woman as old as Mrs. Jones
is. who must be past 60 years old,
and take from them the things
that they have worked hard for,
we are at a loss to know how to
express it. We don't believe that
they would hesitate to rob the
dead. There is a gang in, around
or near Livingston, doing this
I kind of work and the sooner thev
'are caught tin better it will be for
the town and we truly hope that
in the noar future that the law

prosecute them to the full extent

is a dentist with a good repula
tion. Well, we see at last our
Brodhead friend has come out
into the open where we can get a
fair shot at him, although we
have learned that he took his first
lesions under the tutorship of
Fountain Fox Bobbitt, the Cicero
of the Mountains. Now "he claims
that we belong to a political party
that we should be ashamed to
own Our friend forgets that he
went with one of the same stripe
to a convention not long since,
and was so overjoyed that he evnn
forgot his letter to the Signal.
My friend, we are glad you can
have those day dreams and pic
ture for yourself a victory this
fall. It would not be us to envy
you this, but fate has decreed
otherwise. We always had a
tender heart and our feelings easi
ly touched, so in November, when
the fight is over, the poles are
closed, the vote is counted and
Wilson is elected, and you feel ill
at ease and need some friend to
speak a word of cheer to you, call
oa us, it makes uo difference if
we are of a democratic faith, we
will gladly come to your rescue
and with gentle hands and kind
words inform you that it is onlv
a political game. The Cojnmer
cial Clnb met Fridav night and
elected officers. They have thirty
five members and have gone to
work in earnest. Dr. R. G.Webb
was elected president, G. S. Grif
fin, vice president, B H. Griffin,
secretary, and J.P.E.Drummoud,
treasurer. They met again Mon
day night and an invitation is ex
tended to all citizens who have
the upbuilding of the town at
heart. The object, of the club is
to put forth every effort for the
up-building of the town, to invite
manutaciurers to come to our
to.vn, and to advocate everything
ot a progressive nature. Enter
prizes "will be given a hearty wel
come. Last, but not least, a com
mittee was appointed to wait upon
the Fiscal Court in regard to the
pike or that part from Livingston
to Mt. Vernon, as it is a common
mon saying here that the pike wi-1
be built from Mt. Vernon to Brod
head, and the prong to Wildie,
and we' will be left out in the
cold iNow, if our recollection
serves us right, we aie more de
serving than Brodheid, for the
reason the bond issue was de
feated in Brodhead and carried in
Livingston. We can't see'-wny we
should not be on an equal footing
anyway when it comes to build
ing the piice. Now what we want
to see is some dirt thrown on this
side of the county seat and when
work starts on this end of the
pike, will be satisfied and not until
then. We have been waiting and
watching for the past two years
for work to start. We have paid
our road tax, that is our propor
tional part of the pike tax same
as Brodhead has. and we claim
that we are just as deserving as
they, not that we have anything
against the good little town or our
sister town, but we believe there
should be something doing this
way with the pike. We aie not in
position to kmow anything about
the road situation, and can only
give our personal but honest be
lief in the matter, and that is, that
the road will be built to Livings
ton just the same as to Brodhead.
There is no reason why it should
not. From a number of state
ments which the writer heard
made by a number of citizens in
Livingston a faw days since, we
know that a number of the people
in that good town, have the belief
that there will not be any road
south of Mt, Vernon, and while
the above article from our Liv
ingston correspondent is voicing
the sentiment of many men, yet
we want to add, that in justice
and fairness to all concerned, and
more especially the building of the
road, we believe the position is
wrong and that time will prove
the incorrectness of the belief now
existing. Remember there have
been many drawbacks and in this
no one in particular can be cen
sured. The Editor Rice
Ward, who has been in Hamilton,
Ohio, has returned home.
DOES SLOAN'S" LINIMENT
HELP RHEUMATISM?
Ask the man who uses it, he
knows. "To think I suffered all
these wheo one 25c bottle of
Sloan's Liniment cured me,"
writes one grateful user. If you
have Rheumatism or suffer from
Neuralgia, Backache, Soienessj
and stiffness, dont put off get
ting a bottle of Sloan's. It will
give you such welcome relief. It
warms and soothes the sore, stiff
painful places and you feel so
much better. Buy it at any Daug
Store, only 25 cents.

MEXICO
Stern refusal to heed the de
mands of Carranza for the with
drawal of American troops from
Mexico is voiced in the reply of
this Goverment. Upon the attitude
ot Carranza to this reply hinges
war with Mexico, it is stated.
Noting has occurred to indicate a
change on Carranza' s attitude of
implacable hostility toward the
United States. The State Depart
ment expressed anxiety for the
safety of Americans in Mexico.
While measure.: of protection are
being instituted along the coast
towns, aid in the interior
sidered very difficult.
American sentiment is
aroused from Juarez to the west
coast.
Through the country the work
of mobilizing National Gaurdsmen
is being pushed, with the pros
pects that 100,000 or more troops
will be available for border duty.
No estimates have been made of
the number that will be required.
Every Governor has responded to
the call of the President.
United States army scouts have
been busy gathering -information
of Mexican activities south of the
Rio Grande River between Brown
sville and El Paso. Gen. Funston
received no important tidings at
Ft. Sam Houston. Gen Pershing's
reports indicate that Gen. Jacinto
Trevino's troops had made no
advance. A trainload of l,ooo
half-starved peons reached Juarez
from Chihuahua and crossed into
the United States in violation of
recent orders against emigration.
