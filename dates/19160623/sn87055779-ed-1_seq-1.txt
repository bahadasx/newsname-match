PRESSURE IS BEING
BROUGHT ON CARRANZA
United States Has Not Yet
Been Approached by Those
Who Are Seeking
Peace.
titerr.alioiiril News k"ervi' :
WASHINGTON. June 2 A de
termined effort is i eing made today
hy certain Iitin-Amerioa n diplomats
in Washington, assisted hy the Span
ish amhfissador, .Sfimi' Hon Yuan
PJano y Oayanagos, to prevent war
between the Tinted .states and the
de facto government of Mexico.
This was admitted today by all the
"Spanish embassy an.l by lr. Don
Kafael Zaldivar. the Salvadorean
minister to this -our try. So far all
of the efforts to bring about an ad
justment are centered in Mexico
tity where pressure is being brought
to hear upon the Carranzista govern-
ni'-nt. The United states has not
yet been approached on the .subject
in cording to Dr. Zaldivar and van
not be until Carranza acts, as the
note of Sec'y Uansing delivered last
Tuesday places the next initiative in
the hands of the Mexican Kove'n-
ment.
That important developments are
expected, however, vas shown hy
the announcement of Ambassador
Kiano that he had cancelled his
jdans to proceed . Newport to open
th' summer embassy thre and will
remain in Washington for the pres
ent. Nothing to s.
When Sec'y Lansing's attention
w is .lire. t .l to the rn' diatioii re
ports, he aid:
"I know nothing about these sug
gestions and cannot discuss them."
Ir. .uhlivar. t he Salvadorean min
ister, said:
"I have discussed the crisis in
the Mexican affairs of the United
States vx'th such of mv colleagues as
row an in the city and have heen
in touch with otheis who are away.
We stand ready to do anything that
is in our power to present war. f
course ivo cannot act until vv- know
what decision the Carranzista i;ov
ernmem will reach toward the po
sition of the United States as e
jd. lined in the note sent forth last
Tuesday. Put we will do everything
In our power to avert an aimed clash
between the two nations."
Ie.nvhile the administration's at
titude remained unchanged. Pres't
Wilson still is awaiting a complete
report of ".he battle of Carri.al from
Con. pershinu. A message received
by Se-'y of War Taker just before
he entered the cabinet meeting to
day from Jen. Tiinr-ton said that
C.eii. Pershing had advised him that
the complete re ort of the tight w as
on its way to aim t Pershing i bv
specatl courier and that as soon as
it is ie.eive.1 it will be forwarded to
Washington. Bak-r received from
Pershing todav th" stories told bv
straggler who had reached hi com
mand and which had been already
carried in the news dispatcher from
the border. The war sf- retary de
clined to m ike this repel t public on
th cro -.nd that it was inconclusive.
It na leaned, however, that the re
port emphasized the treachery of
th" M'-xi ans and absolved entirely
the Amer "h ar..- from 1 lame for the
n o n t er.

CAPT. ROGERS GIVEN
ORDERS BY BRIDGES
Reported That 50 Ex-Guardsmen
Are Going to Enlist
Before Troops Go
Away.
'o. p. Indiana national guard,
has heen ordered to move to Fort
Penjamin Harrison at Indianapolis
and will leave South Hend ; t 1
o'clock Saturday morning on the
Lake Krie and Western railroad.
'apt. Clinton I . Itogers. who is in
command of the local troops, made
this announcement, following- trie
receipt of orders from Adjt. Gen.
Frank L. Hridges of Indianapolis.
Priday morning.
Accoiding to Papt. Rogers, the
orders received by him from tilt4
commander of the Indiana forces,
left the date of the departure to
the discretion of the captain. He
said the orders were rather vague,
hut believed that further instruc
tions will be received this afternoon
or toni-ht. It is certain, however,
that o. P will leave for Indianap
olis Saturday morning.
103 Mm Had.v.
When the militamen leave lor
Port Penjamin Harrison, it is ex
pected that between 1 1 '. and 12".
men will be on the company roll. At
noon toch-y there were about 10.
enlisted men and although the re
cruiting was going slowly, it was
thought that the number would be
raised by evening'.
It was reported around the uty
Friday morning that 5u ex-members
of Co. F were preparing to join the
guard in a body. According to re
liable authority, these men were
waiting until the linal order to move
Is received by c'apt. Rogers before
enlisting in the company. If they
do this, they will take the new oath
of enlistment and will go to Port
Penjamin Harrison with Ihe troops.
Th-se men are soldiers who have
served several years in the guard
and would have to o through little
j training to ht them for actual ser-
i. e.
I-irgeM Company.
Should these ex--uards!n'n join
the ranks, . P would ! revruited
far above th war strength of l.'ai
men. Thi would make the com
pany one of the largest, if not the
largest, in the state and probably
would send the h.cal t.u-hters to the
Mexican border with the first troops
that have the state.
Twelve new men were added to the
company from the time the oihce
opened Priday morning until 2

today hy Chairman Hay. of the mil
itary affairs committee. Tli'1 original
resolution, framed, by Sec'y of War
Baker, authorized the president to
draft the militia whenever "in his
opinion," an emergency existed
which made the use of the national
guard necessary. As presented to
day, however, the resolution provid
ed: "That in the opinion of the con
gress of the Fnited States an emer
gency now existed which demands
the use of troops iu addition to the
regular army."
The resolution then authorized
the draft of the? militia. The altered
wording put congress on record as
authorizing the use of the militia in
Mexico and as declaring the draft
necessary.
When Chairman Hay presented
the resolution there was no objection
to its consideration.
"Is not a resolution worded in
this way a virtual declaration of
war?" asked Congressman Madden,
republican, of Illinois.
"It wiTs not contemplated that
this would amount to a de laration
of war or a declaration that a state
of war xist-" replied 'imii ni.iii
Hay.
Is .rae step.
Minority Leader Mar.n said tip
adoption of thv resolution was a efy
grave step.
"We say here that an emergency
now exists," added Mr. Matin. ''
should knw that an erne -rtc ncy
exists. With power goes rspon-i-bility

Chairman Hay then reeaho that

that he had l.een informed hy .-ee

EL PASO, Texas, June 23. All that was left of Capt. Boyd's
gallant command have been wiped out in the hills between Ojo
Berrendos and San Luis.
This report reached American offices at Fort Bliss shortly af
ter the receipt of Gen. Pershing's first official version.
Since the Pershing report was received there was gravest an
xiety for the fate of the surviving troopers. The last message
received by Pershing told how they had started a slow retreat from
Carribal. Crippled in movement by their wounded, among them
Capt. Louis Morey, they began their withdrawal to the hills.
WASHINGTON, June 23 Se'y of War Baker this aft ernoon
said that the militia will not go into Mexico at present. He is:ued
this statement:
"The secretary of war announces that it is the intention of the
department to send all of the state militia which has been called
out to the border, a soon as it is ready and fit to go, that is to
say, as soon after it has assembled at the various state mobliza
tion camps and can be inspected, equipped, mustered into Ihe ser
vice and otherwise prepared for dispatch. The militia so sent will
be distributed by Gen. Funston along the border."
