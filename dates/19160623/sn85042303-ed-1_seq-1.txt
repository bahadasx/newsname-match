CAPTAIN HUTCHINSON WANTS A
LIST OF PROSPECTIVE RE
CRUITS SO HE CAN GET THEM
IN CASE OF HURRY CALL.
Captain Hutchinson stated this
morning that he had opened rolls foir
registering names of all who desired
to join a new regiment, in case one is
authorized, and would kpep a list of
all who wished in case the organiza
tion was called for, in order to be
able to put himself in communication
with them immediately upon the call
for volunteers.
Captain Hutchinson thinks It prac
tically certain that one, and perhaps
two other regiments will be called
for before the Mexican trouble Is fin
ally settled and he is very anxious to
enroll as many -who -would be. willing
to go as possible in order that there
would ibe no delay when the call came.
Oklahoma is behind mbst of the
other states in the matter of mobiliza
tion, owing to the fact that Oklahoma
Cityans thought to get the concentra
tion camp located in Oklahoma City,
but It seems that the war department
had other plans, and the camp will be
pitched at Chandler. Captain (Hutch
inson states that he has no idea where
the Oklahoma City people, who wanted
the camp located there, got their au
thority for dreaming that they could
secure it, when the state already has
the establishment at Chandler, where
it has been for several years. All this
necessitated a delay which puts Okla
homa behind other states In the mat
ter of mobilization.
If a call is issued for more troops,
a full company could be recruited in
Ardmore and Carter county In 24
hours, according to figures based upon
expressions of many who are anxious
to join . the army. All who desire
should call on Captain Hutchinson and
have their names enrolled at once.

ADMIRALS MAYO (Left) AND f
Should the developments of the Mexican situation require such action,
the navy is prepared to play an aetive part by blockading Mexican ports and
thus preventing any aid from reaching the Mexicans from outside while the
army shuts up the northern border, In that event the new commander of
the Atlantic fleet. Admiral Henry T. Mayo, will be a busy person. He took
over the command of the fleet on June 19 from its former commander, Ad
miral Frank F. Fletcher, who goes to Washington to become a member of
the general board. Admirals Mayo and Fletcher on the deck of the flagship
Wyoming just after the latter turned the fleet over to the former, seen in
the picture. Admiral Mayo gained international fame by demanding of
General Huerta that Mexico salute the United. States flag.
