The Doe Run Lead
pered Wonderfully Under Dem- :
ocratic Administration
The past week the Doc Run Lead
Company paid off and cancelled 2,
200 bonds of $1,000 each, aggregating
$2,200,000, a forceful illustration of
the prosperity that has attended the
lead mining business the past, two or
three years. It has been an insistent
claim of Republican organs, leaders
and politicians for time out of mind
that any unusual spurt of business
prosperity was due to the fact that
the Republican party was in control
of the government; that to this fact,
even more than to an overruling
providence, was due every bountiful
harvest, the sunshine and the rain,
and all the blessings attendant upon
these. Empty dinner pails, unem
ployed thousands, business depres
sions and panics, that from time to
time showed their ugly heads on the
eve ol national elections, were aitri-
. i ... . . ,
butcd to a wide-spread fear that the j
Democratic party might supplant the I
TO PENITENTIARY FOR LIFE
Two Youths, 17 and 19, Plead Guilty to
Hold-Up and Murder in the
First Degree
Hill 19 years of age, and , The deputy promptly placed him un
. ,i i id .,,,, v tJder arrest and telephoned here to
lit, 17, pleaded guilty to instructed to
Frank
John Whit
charires of murder in the first degre
filed against them by Prosecuting
Attorney Davis, before Judge Huck
last Wednesday morning. The pre
meditated and revolting character of
the murder and the general reputation
of the two youths were such that the
court promptly sentenced each -of
them to life terms in the penitentiary.
On Monday night, June 12th, these
two boys, armed with "the iron end
or front of a buggy shaft," stealth
ily followed a Hungarian named Burn
iston Bramowieh from near the M. R.
& B. T. Railroad station at Flat Kiv
er to the top of Federal Hill, where
they knocked him in the head and
robbed him, inflicting such injury
that he died the following day. Park
hurst Sleeth found the Hungarian
near the club house grounds the next
morning in an unconscious condition,
and the man died without ever re
covering consciousness. He notified
Prosecuting Attorney Davis of the
matter. There was no clue as to who
had assaulted the man, but Mr.
Sleeth suggested to Mr. Davis that
he might not be farwrong if he had
Frank Hill arrested as a suspect. Ac
cordingly, the home of Hill was vis
ited by an officer, and he was told by
the young man s mother tnat sne
didn't know where Frank was, that
he had stayed with John Whitt the
night before. The home of Whitt was
ten visited and John was accused of
being implicated and told that Frank
Hill had confessed the whole thing.
Young Whitt then told the full story
of the crime, and afterwards made a
written confession.
In the meantime Hill had skipped to
Jefferson county, and in a saloon
where a deputy sheriff happened to
be present made a remark to the ef
fect that he was wanted down here.
The Times Needs
No Space Killers
Someone was wondering why The
Times las week did not print a big
picture of President Wilson, who had
just been re-nominated for a second
term as Chief Magistrate of the Na
tion. This was no oversight on the
part -of The Times management. We
did not think it essential that Pres
ident Wilson's picture should again
be published in these columns, at this
time, as we believe that all our read
ers arc quite familiar with the Pres
ident's likeness. We believe that live
news, such as The Times makes a
specialty of, was more greatly to be
desired by our subscribers than such
space killers.
Anyway, ucmucmut vrtu,nwvo
not nominated on their looks, so much
as on their ability to render accept
able service to the people. In this
issue, therefore, appears the platform
in full on which Woodrow Wilson
will make his second race for Pres
ident. The Times has little space in
its news columns for pictures that
aave been published repeatedly and
in many papers
It is what the can
didates stand for that count.

bold Hill and Deputy Snerilf Brown
went to Jefferson county and got him.
The confession of young Whitt was
to the effect that he and Hill had en
tered into S concreted plan to "knock
some Hunkie (Hungarian) in the
head and get some money." They met
by agreement on the street, by the
lestaurant near the M. It. & B. T.
railroad station at Flat River. The
train had just come in and they saw
a Hungarian come down the street
carrying a grip and bundle. Hill re
marked, "there goes one, we'll get
him." They followed their victim to
Federal Hill, stopping at Mauser &
Manley's blacksmith shop where Hill
picked up the iron end or front part
of a buggy shaft, and continued their
pursuit. Arriving at a certain point
on Federal Hill, near the club house
grounds, they came up to the Hun
garian and Hill dealt him a blow on
the head that knocked him down and
subsequently resulted in his death.
They then riffled the Hungarian's
grip and searched his clothes for
money.
At the preliminary examination
Hill told about the same story except
that he declared that it was Whitt
who struck the blow. The case was
called in the Circuit Court Wednes
day morning to get their pleas, and
both promptly entered pleas of guilty.
After they were sentenced they left
the court room laughing, Whitt re
marking that he was just 17 that day
and his sentence was his birthday
gift. Neither of them seemed to have
any moral sense of responsibility or
realization of the heinous crime they
had committed.
Within the last year Prosecuting
Attorney Davis has convicted Whitt
four times and Hill seven times of
misdemeanors.
OurCorrespondents
The Farmimrton Times, is indeed
proud of its corps cf correspondents,
and we do not feel that there is need
of explaining to Times readers the
reason for such feelings. Those who
have been reading our several col
umns of news from different places
throughout St. Francois county, we
believe, are in position to bear testi
mony that our pleasurable feelings
are correctly founded.
It will require additional evidence
to convince The Times management
that there is a county paper in the
entire State of Missouri that has a
more regular or more interesting or
larger list of county correspondents.

me the following statement:
That whatever differences exisbe-

and the
nnan ni i t .its i mi's mmn.nii,B
do not involve any charges of dishon-i
-
esty or immorality, either as to the,
personal character or official charac-
ter of Dr. Scrutchfield; but rather
these differences are based on the pol
icies of Dr. Scrutchfield as L'uch su
pcrintendent, and the method of cor
rying out these policies, together
with the undiplomatic way in which
these policies and his management is
carried on.
Dr. Scrutchfield docs not feel that
the Board of Managers should, if
they deem it best, be permitted to
both prefer charges and thereafter
act as both judge and jury in trying
him upon these charges, if they are
made; and the Board of Managers,
both individually and collectively, are
o the same opinion as Dr. Scrutch
lield as to this matter, and so ex
pressed themselves both individually
and officially by their actions herein
after stated; and for this reason Dr.
Scrutchfield surges! ed to the Board

The Mexican situation is tense and
war with that unhappy and anarchy-
ridden country is imminent if it has
not already begun. The defacto Car-
ranzista government made an impel-
ative demand upon the United States
government that the expeditionary
troops sent into Mexico in pursuit of
Villa and his bandits be withdrawn
immediately. The Mexican note was
couched in insulting language. Sec
retary of State Lansing forwarded a
reply to the Mexican note Tuesday,
recounting the atrocities of the
Mexicans and the defacto govern
ment's inability or refusal to protect
American lives and stop the incurs
ions of bandits on the border, and

News of the battle was received in

For some reason Gen. Gonzales kept
the storv secret until late in the af

Huppel,' returning to the border from
the interior, brought to til paso tne
news that he had seen numbers of
Mexican dead along the Mexican Cen-

an encounter with the gnngoes.
Gen. Gonzales' first step after con
firming the news was to issue a state
nent placing the blame on the Ameri
an commander. He charged that the
American troops fired first on the
Mexicans and that their shots were di
ccted at a courier who had just pre
sented to them a request that they

American Army officers- declared
ibiolute disbelief in Gen. Gonzales'

The companies made answer or return

October 2, IBM.
The case of James A. Terry against
the Doe Run Lead Co. for the recov
ery of money which plaintiff averred
was loaned to the company through
the late F. P. Graves, then Superin
tendent of the Doe Run Lead Com
pany, was settled in the Circuit
Court of this county last Wednesday
(the court being in adjourned session)
by the payment of $9,998 to Perry by
the company.
On May 25th, at the regular May
term, in a jury trial, a judgment for
$8,783 with interest from February
14, UtS, at (i per cent, was awarded
Perry, and the company immediately
filed a motion for a new trial and in
arrest of judgment. On Tuesday of
this week the company's motion for
a new trial was withdrawn, and satis
faction of judgment for $9,998 was en
tered of record in open court. The
settlement was the result of a com
promise, as there were two other
claims of a similar nature on file
against the company one by Bridget
Perry and the other by Lenora Perry.
These two claims were dropped for
$1.00 each, the company paying the
costs of litigation.
It appeared from the evidence at
the trial which closed on May 25th,
awarding judgment lo James A. Per
ry, that defendant had been an em
ploye of the Doe Run Lead Conipuny,
and that at sundry times he had loan
ed to the late F. P. Graves, then Su
perintendent, money for the use of
the company, receiving therefor notes
of the company for the amounts so
loaned. These notes were later re
newed, and in the renewal were signed
by Mr. Graves, but not as Superin
tendent or for the company, evidently
an oversight on his part. After Mr.
Graves' removal as Superintendent,
the company refused to recognize the
notes as a debt against it, and suit
was broufht by ",Ir. r-.ry, with the
result given. It is. said that there are
other notes of similar character
outstanding, but of that we have no
definite information.
there, along came Mr. Markley. So
I said to Downs, her comes Markley;
I want to speak to him. And as he
came up, I got up and we spoke and
shook hands. I had been with him, I
think, about 5 minutes, when I went
back to the Squire's office, and went
inside along with Less Mitchell, who
had been standing on the outside while
I was across the street with Downs.
Then, as we went, Less and I, Less
went back to the inside door and
looked in where the trial was being
held. I picked up a newspaper and
started to read, and after reading a
few lines, laid the paper down and
moved over near an outside window.
As I did so, I motioned to, or asked,
Jake Sehaffer, who was standing out
side near he fiont door. He came in
to where I was and I said this to
him, "Jake, I have just had a talk
with Mr. Markley, and he tells me
that nothing can be done fcr me that
all I see for me, is to beat it." Then
Jake said, "Go to it and beat it;
damned if I hunt for you." And then
he started away. I then took held of
his coat sleeve and said wait. Then I
looked at the window and at where
Less Mithcell was standing just in
side near the inner door. Then it was
that Jake looked around and winked at
me. I then jumped out of the win
dow as Jake started for the inner
door.

Whichever side began the engage
ment, the Mexicans had the advan
tage, for they had provided them
selves with a machine gun, and this
is supposed to have done deadly ex
ecution in the ranks of the Americans.
That the latter were not inefficient,
however, was proven by the number

The battle began about 10:30 a. m.

apparently ended by both sides with
