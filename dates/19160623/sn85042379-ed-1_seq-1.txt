FINE PREMIUMS OFFERED
Every Farmer in Valley County Has
Chance to Win Valuable Premium
at Fair This Fall.
Valley County will have a fair in
September which will be so much bet
ter than any of those previously held
as to entirely outclass them.
Glasgow business men have come
forward most liberally with special
premiums of exceptionally high val
ue. A much greater incentive for
the farmer to pay more attention to
the' products of his farm is thus cre
ated,' there is every indication that
the competition wrill be keen among
them.
The fair buildings and grounds are
now being put in shape for the fair
with additional space being provided
for the big exhibits expected and the
amusement events that are always
staged. The big attraction of the
fair in the way of entertainment at
the grounds this year will be "Rollo
The Limit," who is styled the "Death
Defter." Twice each day Rollo will
thrill those in attendance with his re
markable feat consisting of shooting
down a seventy foot incline on roller
skates, turning a loop in mid air,
over a twenty-live foot space, landing
on his feet upon a platform placed
opposite the incline.
Rollo has performed this daring
leap at the State Fair in Minnesota,
Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois
and Ohio, and at Mardi Graus and
local fairs throughout the East. This
is the first time he has shown in Mon
tana and the Fair Association is pay
ing a high price to offer this thriller
to the visitors of the Fair.
For the special amusement of the
children as well as the grown ups
the Fair Association has signed the
Ranzo and Arno Trio, who put on an
act of oddities. These are eccentric
comedy stars who are here for the
summer, having come from the Com
ide Francis at Paris. This work is
full of laughter from the start to fin
ish, without the slap-stick or vulgar
features found in the work of their
imitators.
One feature of this work and a line
of fun that furnishes exceptionally
laughable situations is the trained
zelJra. This exhibition consumes
about ten minutes, and is guaranteed
to remove the most obstinate fit of
grouch.
The racing program will be even
better than last year with a large
entry of fast horses, big purses, and
plenty of speed. The track at the
Fair Grounds is being put in fine con
dition and the speed events will be
worth going a long way to see. There
will be motor-cycle races every day
and it is possible that a novelty in
auto racing will be offered which will
be amusing as well as exciting.
Everybody will go to the Valley
County Fair this year, the farmers
all express intentions of having big
ger exhibits than ever before, the en
tertainment for them will excell any
other year and everybody else in the
County will be there to participate in
the Farmers' Picnic.
HAD STOLEN PROPERTY
Two floating characters who gave
their names as W. D. Hägen and Hel
leck Omsberg were picked up by the
sheriff's office Wednesday night when
they tried to dispose of a bunch of
trapaulins, etc., to Dug Hall at the
Elk Livery Stable. They will have
their preliminary hearing today.
Thomas Walsh, who claims to be
deaf and dumb, was arrested Wednes
day afternoon after trying to scalp
Tim Nacey at the Star Bar. It seems
that Wnlsh had been making him
self generally obnoxious about the
place and was thrown ou*. He came
back in however and in the m «lee that
followed en a deep gash in Tim's
head. He vas arraign-J before Judge
Evans yestivday and found guilty and
sentenced to thirty days in the county
jail.
GOVERNMENT GEOLOGIST HERE
A. J. Collier in the employ of the
U. S. Government Geological survey
service was a pleasant caller at the
Courier office Monday. Mr. Collier
carried on extensive surveys in this
section last year looking up the lo
cations of the lignite coal beds
throughout the north country and he j
ft * inriiratinns wprp VArv itaa H
indications were very good
for Oi.^ 'nd Glasgow and left the
impressioi. .tat the government was
also very much interested in the pros
pects through this section of the coun
try and had experts out surveying the
districts with a view to locating fav
orable drilling grounds.
Mr. Collier stated that he had found
large deposits of lignite coal through
out the north country especially
around Opheim.
SHOOTING AT HAMBLIN
Hamblin, a small inland town south
of Wolf Point, was the scene of a seri
ous shooting last weeek, in which C.
W. Hamblin, postmaster of that place
and well known resident, suffered a
gunshot wound through the breast.
The reason for the shooting is not
known but the offender was promptly
taken into custody.
The wounded man was brought to
Wolf Point in an automobile and was
taken to a Williston hospital on No.
4 that night.
An examination at Wolf Point fail
ed to reveal the course of the bullet,
as the missile had been deflected by
a rib but it was thought that the
wound was very serious as the vic
tim suffered greatly and was in a
weakened state late Tuesday evening
before he was put aboard the train.
DIVERS UNSUCCESSFUL
The divers who have been here
from Seattle for the past several
days, searching for the body of Ike
Murphy, left Tuesday for their home
having accomplished nothing. The
river is so swift that it makes it al
most impossible for a man to work.
The river was thoroughly searched
for a couple of miles below where
the accident happened. It is under
stood a large party will go to the
river tomorrow to try and recover
the remains.—Malta Enterprise.
WILL LOOK FOR
OIL PROSPECTS
Geologist Will Survey County With
View to Locating Coal and Oil.
A party headed by Mr. H. A. Col
lier, of the United States Geological
Department at Washington, D. C., ar
rived in Glasgow on Monday and fitted
up an outfit to make a survey of
Valley County. Mr. Collier will start
work at the Northeastern corner of j
the County and work across to the
he j Sunday.
the Missouri river and from there
east to the Sheridan county line.
The purpose of the geological sur
vey will be to locate and designate any
coal veins which may exist in the
County,, with a description of the
quantity and quality of it, and to
assertain the relative cost of produc
tion. If coal in sufficient quantities
for commercial purposes is located, the
land will be withdrawn and held for
the development of the coal fields.
Attention will also be given by Mr.
Collier to the possibilities of oil de
posits, existing in Valley County, and
the indicated gas regions will be
thoroughly gone into with the inten
tion of making a map of the possible
gas and oil districts, and whether or
not there exists conditions favorable
to a large oil disposit in this section
of the state.
Mr. Collier in an interview spoke
favorable of the feasibility of Valley
County producing gas and oil. He
stated the United States Geological
Department has known for a long
time that indications found in well
drilling throughout the County were
typical of oil bearing stratas. While
in the district just north of the reser
vation recently,. Mr. Collier inspected
a well sunk near Avondale, and found
teeth of the three-toed horse, taken
from the well, and also the leg bone
of a camel, which had been brought
up from a considerable depth. These
were deposited in a formation of the
Salt water period, and indicate a stra
ta of gravel similiar to that found in
many sections where oil and gas has
been produced.
The work Mr. Collier is engaged
in will occupy his time for the entire
summer. Upon his return to Wash
ington he will compile a complete re
port from his field notes taken. This
report will be published by the De
partment and can be secured by any
one desiring it.

Awaiting Orders.
Owing to a delay in the troop movements, Company G was
ordered not to entrain last night by Colonel Dan J. Donohoe, but
to await 24 hours. All preparations had been made to leave, and
the men were all ready to depart when Captain Layton received
the telegram advising him of the delay. A farewell reception
had been planned by the Commercial Club to be given in the Gib
son Opera House but this was postponed until the night the troops
actually leave.
In all probability Company G will leave tonight on No. 3.
Three tourist sleepers and a baggage car will be attached to the
train for the use of the soldiers. Today the men have been mark
ing time, eager for definite news as to the time of departure. All
are anxious to get into camp at Fort Harrison and begin active

In case the men leave tonight, the public reception for the
Company will be held in the Gibson Opera House, up to the time
the men go to the train.

The business or professional posi

by having their men leave without an
opportunity to get business affairs in

j narrowly escaped a disastrous smash
| Hingham, a small town west of
' Havre Monday morning. No. 3 was
j standing on the main line when No.
2 came into the yards at a speed of
about 35 miles per hour, the engineer
thinking that the track was clear.
}uick work on the part of the flag
man on No. 3 barely averted a headon
collision between the two mammoth
transcontinental trains. He threw j
the switch which headed No. 2 into
a string of cabooses which were
{standing on the side track. Both,
aithe engineer and fireman on No. 2
jumped in time to save themselves
and no casualities resulted. It was
an exceptionally narrow "squeak"
however, and all east bound trains
were delayed several hours.

keg of old cans, dirt and ashes above
his head, making ready to throw it
over on the dump pile, when the bot
tom came out. A little school girl
saw it as she was passing along the
street and reported it to her moher.
"I hope you didn't listen to what
he said," said the mother.
"He didn't say a word to me," re
plied the little girl; "he just walked
to the right side of his wagon, talking
to God."

HEAVY HITTING FEATURES

of
Heavy hatting and a comedy of
errors marked the game between
Glasgow and Poplar on the local
grounds last Sunday afternoon. The
game started out with promise of
being hard fought to the finish when
Poplar annexed one in their half of
the second inning and Glasgow chas
ed two scores across home plate in
their half of the same inning. Glas
gow secured another run in the third
as did Poplar and the score stood 3
to 2 in favor of the locals until the
sixth when the balloon went up. In
this inning Glasgow connected with
the Poplar pitcher for seven safe
bingles and chased in eight runs be.
lore the smoke cleared away.
From then on interest waned and
the game closed with the score stand
ing 13 to 2 in favor of Glasgow.
The locals connected for a total of
twelve safe bingles off the much tout
ed Indian pitcher Means, who finished
the game here looking as though no
had been through a three days' bom
bardment in the Verdun trenches.
Spaulding pitched a good consis
tent game holding the Poplar team to
six hits badly scattered. Both teams
loomed up big in the error column,
which partly accounts for the heavy
score
