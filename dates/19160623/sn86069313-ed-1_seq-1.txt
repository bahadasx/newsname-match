Americans Give Account of Them
selves Enemy Uses Ma
chine Gun.
El Paso, Tex., Juno 21. Ameri
can nml Carranza troops fought a
jiloody battle today only a few hours
Jitter President Wilson's C,000-word
rcbuka yesterday to Gen. Carranza
had gone forward to Mexico City.
Vlth which side victory rested Is not
known.
4 The engagement took place on the
Santo Domingo ranch near the Mex
ican town of Carrlzal which Is nine
miles southwest of Villa Ahumada,
tho Mexican field headquarters In
Northern Chihuahua. The number
of dead, American or Mexican, was
not definitely known here tonight,
but nearly a score of Gen. Pershing's
men are said to have been killed and
the Mexicans are said to have lost
more than two score. Seventeen
Americans are declared by Mexican
officials to have been captured and to
have been hurried to Chihuahua City
under adequate guard. A machine
gun used by the Mexicans, is report
ed to have done heavy execution.
The Americans engaged are
thought to have been members of n
troop from tho Tenth Cavalry, a ne
gro regiment, roturnlng from a
scouting trip to Ouzman. Tho size
of the Mexican force, whoso com
mander. Gen. Felix Gomez, was kill
ed, Is not known.
News Withhold.
News of tho battle was received In
Juarez early this afternoon by Gen.
Krnnclsco Gonzales, Carranza com
mander of the military zone of tho
border, for some reason Gen. Gon
zales kept the story secret until late
In the afternoon when an American,
J. C. Huppel, returning to the border
from tho Interior, brought to El Paso
tho news that ho had seen numbers
of Mexican dead along tho Mexican
Central Itallroad tracks at Villa Ahu
mada, Mnd had been told that there
had been an encounter.
Gen. Gonzales' first step after con
firming tho news was to Issue a state-nu-'nt
placing tho blame on tho Amer
ican commander. Ho charged that
the American troops fired first on tho
Mexicans, and that their shots wero
directed at a courier who had Just
presented to them a request that they
rqllre.
American army officers declared
nbsoluto disbelief tonight in Gen.
Gonzales' assertions. Tho .opinion
was expressed that if tho Americans
fired on tho Mexicans they did bo bo
causo it was necessary In order to in
sure their own safety.
Gen. Trovlno's rccont warning to
Gen. Pershing not to send his troops
east, south or west of their positions
was recalled.

PADUCAU LAWYER LOCKS
MANDATE IN SAFE
STANLEY'S AUTHORITY TO AP
POINT OFFICERS IS DIS
v PUTED..
Paducah, Ky., Juno 20. Governor
Stanley has appointed Sanders E.
Clay, Hal S. Corbett and George C.
Wallace commissioners of Paducah.
Previously he had appointed Ernest
Lackey mayor. These appointments
were to fill vacancies caused by the
ouster suit decided last week by tho
court of appeals.
Lackey succeeded himself, as did
Wallace. None of those appointed can
take office until the mandate from the
state court Is filed. The mandate has
arrived, but John K. Hendrick, coun
sel for tho plaintiffs In tho ouster
suit, placed it In his safe, saying It
would not bo filed at this time. Why
ho Is holding up tho document was
not stated. No yacancy can exist un
til tho mandate Is filed.
Tho only change In the appoint
ments announced was Hal S. Corbett
Instead of S. H. Wlnstead. The only
officials In ofllco the governor ap
pointed wero Lacey and Wallace.
When' tho mandate Is placed to rec
ord Attorney Hendrlck's Is expected
to have an Injunction ready to re
strain Gov. Stanley's appointees from
assuming office, as ho contends the
governor had no power to mako tho
appointments.
Attorney Hendrick says this pow
er rests with Commissioner L. A.
Washington, who wub not connected
with tho ouster proceedings. But
Commissioner Washington is not cer
tain of his power. Gov. Stanley is
said to have the opinions of Attorney
General Logan and a number of
prominent attorneys of Frankfort
and was satisfied that ho had tho ap
polntlvo powor. Tho uestlon may
go to tho court of appeals for a de
cision, which could not bo had bo

CO. II READY FOR
FOREIGN SERVICE
SIXTY-FIVE MEN PREPARED TO
MARCH TO THE MEXICAN
BORDER.
HARTFORD IS DECORATED
Plugs Fly From Business Houses
Mr. Riley Offer U.-o of Com
merclnl Hotel.
Company II, of the Kentucky
National Guard, has answered the
call to arms for service on the Mex
ican border In a most patriotic spir
it. Sixty-five men have reported for
duty and many recruits are expected
to enlist to-day.
Captain DeWeese arrived from
Louisville Tuesday to take command
of the company. He Is assisted by
Lieut. Shown and First Sergeant
Llles. Capt. DeWeese, altho suffer
ing somewhat from a sprain, express
ed enthusiasm for active service and
expects the famous old H company to
give a splendid account of Itself on
the border, If given an opportuni
ty. Few of the old originals of tho
company remain In the service but
the men who have enlisted since Its
organization nearly ten years ago
are husky looking fellows and will
surely keep up the rep of the organ
ization. Few are expected to fail
on tho physical examination.
The boys are camping in the Com
mercial Hotel building and practical
ly all of them seem to be In high
spirits. In fact, many are Jubllent
over the possibility of some real live
service and only one or two seem to
have their mind on the fair one back
at home. These are expected io be
converted into optimistic troopers
when told of the beauty of tho Mex
ican senorlta.
Hartford Decorated.
The little city has entered into the
military spirit and the soldiers of
company H are encouraged by the
stars and stripes waving merrily at
tho command of the gentle breezes
from practically every business
houso In town.
Mr. J. C. Riley, owner of the Com
mercial Hotel building, is furnishing
sleeping quarters for the boys In tho
hotel, In return for which he asks
nothing. Such displays of patriot
ism certainly demands admiration
and will go far toward brightening
old Hartford's spot on the map.
The company is expecting orders
to move tho concentration camp,
probably to Ft. Thomas, within tho
next few days. Recruits aro invited
to enlist during tho interval.

FOREIGN POWERS

ENTENTE POWERS THINK MEXI

GERMANY.
URGE MEXICO TO PEACE
I'rcssuro Being BrouRlit oh Carranza
to Prevent Open Hostilities With
Tho United States.
Mexico City, June 21. The Amer
ican note has been received here.
Washington, June 21. Strong
pressure- is being brought to bear
upon Gen. Carranza by representa
tives of European powers to prevent '
him from forcing a break with the
United States. Indirect reports
reaching the State Department today
told of these efforts and said there
was a possibility they would be suc
cessful. Agents of the entente allies are un
derstood to be active for peace.chlef
ly because they believe German In
fluence has sought to Inflame the
Mexican 'government against the
United Stattes with a view of pre
venting this country from gathering
In trade formerly controlled by Ger
many in Mexico, South and Central
America.
It is pointed out that Carranza
might avoid war by calling for an In
international commission to discuss
the border situation, as provided for
in tho treaty of 1848. So far, how
ever, no suggestion for such a step
has come from Mexico.
May Be Trying to Duck.
A definite statement has been re
ceived that General Carranza Is do
ing all fri- hia power at this time to
protect Americans In Mexico from at
tack by the populace. He Is said to
have given Special Agent Rodgers In
Mexico City all the aid In his power
In arranging for trains to carry
American refugees from tho Interior
to Vera Cruz. In some quarters
hero this was construed as evidence
that he Is not bent upon provoking
hostilities.
The State Department had no ad
vices bearing out these hopeful Indi
cations, except that from Special
Agent Rodgers announcing the prog
ress of his efforts to get American
citizens out. With the full consent
of the Carranza authorities, he said,
and the promise of adequate protec
tion from possible bandit attacks, he
had aranged for a special train to
leave Mexico City tomorrow carrying
Americans to Vera Cruz.
Safe Conduct Promised.
Mr. Rodgers added that he and his
diplomatic associates in tho Mexi
can capital had been given every as
surance of safe conduct and protec
tion on their trip to tho coast, If It
became necessary for them to leave.
Tho corps 6t American newspaper
correspondents thoro has decided to
remain with Mr. Rodgers until such
time as he may find it necessary to
leavo.
A dispatch from Mr. Rodgers to
day said ono special car carrying
about thirty Americans, mostly wom
en and children, had already loft
Mexico City for Vera Cruz.
A number of dispatches were re-,
celved from -consular officers and
agents throughout Mexico. They
agreed that the tension everywhere
was keyed to a high pitch, but that
no disturbances to Americans had oc
curred. Expect Wnr.
Washington today anxiously await
ed word from Mexico City regarding
General Caranza's attitude toward
tho American note sent him yester
day, for on him doponded tho ques
tion of war betwoon the two repub
lics. High officials hero admitted
privately they look for war, although
care was taken to avoid any formal
expressions or acts which might ap
pear forerunners of a declaration of
war.
The only answer required from
Gen. Carranza is action suppressing
outlaw treatment of Americans, and
'officials feared against hope that this
would be done.
Unofficial versions of the note
probably were published in Mexico
City to-day and the official text may
already be in Carranza's hands.
Marching orders for national guard
organizations summoned to the col
ors under President Wilson's call are
still held up at the War Department
pending completion of the mobiliza
tion of the troops at State camps.
Just as soon as a sufficient num
ber of the guardsmen have been mus
tered into the federal service the War
Department will act on Gen. Funs
ton's report of yesterday, stating tho
number of. units he desired and to
what points- he desired them forward
ed. Only preliminary reports on the
progress of tho mobilization in va
rious States had reached the War De
partment today. These were viewed
as satisfactory.
Secretary Baker said tho sugges
tion that the senior class at West
Point Military Academy bo graduat
ed Immediately for active service was
under consideration, but that no de
cision had been reached. The ca
dets have completed three years of
their work and could be commission
ed as second lieutenants immediately
It the emergency warrants such steps.
The department had no additional
advices from Gen. Funston regarding
tho movements of Carranza troops
near the border or In the .vicinity
of Gen. Pershing's column In Mex
ico. Great interest was expressed in
the probable course to be followed
In case Mexicans attack the American
column. It was regarded as proba
ble that a general rapid advance
would be ordered from the border
to a line perhaps 100 or more miles
south of the border. This line then
would be fortified and held until vol
unteer reinforcements become avail
able. Thus fighting would be thrown
Into the enemy's territory and the
border protected against further ban
dit attacks by thorough policing of
the country behind the main line.
The Mexican embassy issued a
statement today, saying dispatches
from Mexico City told of several
American .citizens, large property
holders. Informing the Governor Ta
basco that they would remain in Mex
ico, even though the United States
should declare war. According to
the statement full protection was
promised them.
SHOOTING SCRAPE ON
STREETS OF HARTFORD
DICK STEWART SHOOTS ANDY
ALFORD FOUR BALLS TAKE
EFFECT.
What came near being a fatal
shooting affray took place in Hart
ford late Tuesday evening, when
in an altercation of some sort, the
cause and particulars of which we
could not learn. Mr. Alford was
shot thru both arms and once in the
right shoulder, the latter shot enter
ing at about the point of shoulder
blade, coming out at top of the shoul
der and ranging on the outer side of
shoulder blade. Physicians state
that the most serious wound Is tho
one In or near the elbow where ono
of tho bones were broken. This
would have undoubtedly been a fatal
shooting had it not been for the fact
that Just as Stewart commenced to
shoot, John Glenn unconsciously
walked between Stewart and Alford
and was not able to get from be
tween them for a few moments, dur
ing which time Stowart was shooting
over and around Glenn. While tho
wounds aro necessarily very painful
Mr. Alford is not thought to be In
any danger, except some unforeseen
trouble should arise. Stewart sur
rendered to Sheriff S. O. Keown.-

STATE TO SEEK
CHANGE OF VENUE
com'th. atty. serves notice
of intended court
motion;
JUSTICE DEMANDS IT
Says Attorney C. E. Smith, Who Will
Ask For The Order on July
Third.
Notices are now In the bands of
Sheriff S. O. Keown and his deputies
for service on all parties Indicted" in
Ohlo county, for alleged "possum
hunting," who havo been brought be
fore the court by proper process, no
tifying them that Commonwealth'
Attorney, C. E. Smith, will make
motlon on the first day of the regular
July, 1916, term of the Ohio Circuit
Court to transfer all of said cases to
some other county for trial. A
large number of people havo main--talneil
from the beginning of prose
cutlons of "night riders" and "pos
sum hunters" that a fair trial could
not be had in this county. This con
tention has been fortified by the re
sult of trials had at former terms oC
court. The fact is that only four
trials have been had which resulted.
In the acquittal of three of those
tried and the conviction, of only one'.
This step on the part of the Common
wealth's Attorney has been taken at
the urgent request of a vast number
of people who have urged vigorous
prosecution of the most guilty of
those engaged In "possum hunter"
depredation.
Notices, are likewise In the hands
of Sheriff Keown and his deputies for
all of those sued la the five civil ac.
tlons brought in the Ohio Circuit
Court, that the venue of said actions
be changed from Ohio county for tri
al. This latter motion will effect
quite a large number of parties who
are defendants In one or more of the
civil actions now pending in the Ohio
Circuit Court.
C. W. Barnes is plaintiff in one off
such actions to which there are 35
defendants, Pen Maddox, administra
tor of Harrison Maddox, deceased, Is".
the plaintiff in another of such ac
tions in which there aro 19 defend
ants, J. M. Igleheart, C. L. Brown and
Tom Heflln are each plaintiffs in oth-
er separate actions wherein there are
22 defendants, being the same par
ties in each action. Should Judge
Slack on consideration of tho mo
tions change the venue there Is no
way of Judging or ascertaining to
what county said cases will be .trans
ferred. Should a transfer be made
the docket of the Ohio Circuit Court
would be clear of all prosecutions
growing out of "possum hunter" dep--rodatlons
in Ohio county.
