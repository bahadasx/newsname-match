There are undoubtedly some tsn
million voters in this country, Re-
publicans, Progressives, Inde
pendents and Democrats, who believe
heart and soul in the constructive re
forms agitated during the past de
cade and carried into effect by Pres
ident Wilson through the agency of
the Democratic party. This was pos
sible because the Democratic party
was the only political agency not
dominated by the selfish special in
terests opposed to these reforms. Un
der Wood row Wilson the Democratic
party hits been kept free of special in
terest control and today remains the
only political agency available for the
continuation of this good work.

MAE LaPORTE
AND COMPANY PLAY TO CROWDED
HOUSES UNDER BIG TENT
POPULAR PRICES
The Mae LaPorte Stock Co., play
ing under tent at the corner of Main
and Fulton streets, are making a hit
with the theatre going public of
this city.
Since their opening on Mondayt
night they have played to a crowd
ed house each ntght. Their plays
ar eall produced in excellent style
and last night they played to a pack
ed house and many more were turned
away.
Tonight the company will produce
one (if their highest class productions
entitled "The Great White Trail."
On tomorrow, Saturday, afternoon a
matinee will be given for the bene
fit of those unable to attena in the
evening and a good show is assured
at th'3 time. .'Saturday night they
will close their run in this city with
their delightful little play entitled
"Arrops tho Desert."
Ibe admission pr'ce to these plays
is within the reach of all, being only
10c and iCc.
The month of May, 1916, produced
a greater volume of wage increases
than any preceding 12 months of
American history. Against this wall
of prosperity, Republican spell-binders
will make little progress in try
ing to stampede American working
men into voting a return of Repub
lican conditions.
Shelled to the kernel the only real
complaint against Wilson is that he
has not plunged the country into the
European war. But in adapting this
to political issues, the Republicans
are careful to avoid any intimation as
to what side we should now re light
ing upon. Of course the idea is to
get votes from the sympathizers with
both sides in that carnival of blood
and destruction. Is It possible to con
ceive a more hypocritical, loathsome
piece of political trickery?
The commissioner of navigation re
potts 1200,000 vessel tonnage now
building In American shipyards as
against 250,000 in 1912. The Unit
ed States for the first time in 60 years
has become the leading ship builder
among nations.
