WHY NOT NOW?
Is it not Time that the Canton
Commercial Club Got Busy on the
^Post Office Question?
Some of our citizens suggest that
the members of the Canton Commer
cial Club take a few nights off from
their rubbers of Norwegian whist at
the club rooms and get something
really started toward the securing of
a site for a new postofflce building and
also for tree delivery of mall within
our city limits which they claim we
are entitled to. It has been a long
time since the Club has done anything
for the benefit of the city at large
and quite often remarks are heard
that art no credit to this organization.
We believe if they start something
that they will find the people perfect
ly willing to co-operate with them.
