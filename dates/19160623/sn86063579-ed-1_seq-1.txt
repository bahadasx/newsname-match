TWause of the fact that one of
her honored citiiens, Sir Amos Pol
lard, is grand commander of the
Knights Templar, of New Mexico,
Deming is brought to the limelight at
Los Angeles, where there is now as
sembled, the 33rd triennial conclave
of the Knights Templar of America.
It is also the centennial anniversary
which makes it the most important
Templar meeting ever held. ThU
makes it especially fortunate for
Deming and her honored son, who will
he one of the prominent figures in
the sonthwest. ,
The meeting this year is the third
triennial conclave of the order to be
held op the Pacific const, and the
first to be held in Los Angeles.
Practically all commanderies in the
I'nitod States jurisdiction, including
Alaska, Honolulu, and the Philippines
will be represented. Representatives
from the grand priories of Canada,
Trelana and a delegation from Mexi

I will endeavor to diaeuss the
creamery situation in detail for the
special benefit of a few who seem to
be laboring nnder tba iaapreaaion that
the directors art going "south" with
the net proceeds.
- l-et me say in the firxt place there
are no net proceed, at tbt present
time, or since tba plant baa been in
operation. Why It ia a amall con
cern at present, and ia doing very
nicely to pay running expenses. W
are not receiving tba cream that we
xhmild, because there ia no grass for
the dairy stock, and feed ia too high
for the farmer to feed oa a milk
producing basis.
Tt coats very little mora to make
."000 pounds of butter per week than
1,000 lbs., so if we war nuking the
cutting down expense to a cost of
about e per pound, not consider
ing the cartons and wrapper.
Three ef th directors are business
men, E. L. Foulks, T. It. Taylor, and
Frank Nordhaus. I know personally
that these three gentlemen work con
tinuously to make the enterprise a
success, receiving a mighty few
"thank yous." These men know not
the word of failure, and their busi
ness foresight teaches them that
dairying is a good thing for farm
ers, it is, in ran. an upun 10 in
whole state.
The plant was put in operation for
th benefit of the fanner, to keep hi
product from going to waste, but
there are always a few farmers who
have an idea they are beizg "trim
med." Tt i than ha gt tba old
stoue chnrn and lets his '.' work the
dasher, spURLIng the room with
perfectly good cream, f which she
cares not tla eaet.
When she brl:-.ri It to town, she
trade it for a fw groearies. The
merchant can't n-Jti to pay mneh
for it, for reasons eas"y arsiood,
and which good women ejenot kc!p.
Some of this butter cannot b used
at all
How much better if the farmer
hroucfct bis butter fat to cream
ery and got hi rheek every Tfi dsy. j
and then paid easb for his store;

Intervention is rxiected here, but
just how soon, no one knows. The
American force south of here is safe,
though outnumbered. The truck
trains are going night and day piling
up a reserve of food and ordnance
stores for use at the advance base.
The roads are being miulo permanent
so that the line of communication can
he kept open.
No doubt a In rye munlicr of th
militiamen recently culled out ill be
concentrated here or at Deininir-' But
if war comes, they will be rapUly
shifted to the advance base. The
New Mexicans luivo the ndvnutiigr of
being acclimated ni.d fully equiped.
For this reason the regitnert fill
probably be used in the first line.
The expedition south nf Columbus
assumes the fullest measure of pro
tection of the Lunn county border
in fact to the whole state. There is
a considerable' amount of apprehen
sion aa to the security along the
border. This is certain when the in
vasion begins, all pressure will he re
moved from the border. The. army
must take rare of this mutter for its!
own security. The danger is all in
the past, the border advancing with
the flag. There are no raids on the
New Mexico border now because
American troops are l-"0 miles in old
Mexico, in other words, Deming is 200
miles from the bonier, which makes it
safe from possible raiding.
Luna county stands the main
chance for great commercial devel
opment, because of the situation.
While some Deming business men are
taking advantage of the present
ituation, many are not. It doesn't
seem possible that Deming yet real
izes what tremendous . xissi!iilities
underly the greiit military activity
that is going 011 in the county. For
tunes will he 'made by some keen to

George W. McCunn is ouc of our
successful farmers who hits won out
on his own merits and good, hard,
well-directed tabor, lie is very much
in favor of the dairy herd and is al
ways willing to give his prneitiuul ex-
lierience for the benefit of others.
In a conversation with the Grnphio
Monday, Mr. McCan, expressed tbs
opinion that most any good dairy
breed is good for this section. It is
the individual cow that counts, and
success deienda very much upon the
proper handling. When this is done
dairying will become one of the most
up-building industries in this valley.
The farmer must study to feed his
cows economically in order to get
best results, and should endeavor to
grow most of aiiat he feeds. A small
portion of cotton seed meal, or some
other feed of high protein value, may
be used with profit.
The good feed that can be easily
grown here includes alfalfu, silage,
cane, and mnixe heads, which ought
to be ground in order jo get the best
results. Cane and mnixe can be
grown much cheaper than alfalfa
An average day's ration for a cow
should V about as follows :
Twenty pounds of silage, fiv
Munds of alfalfa, 0 pounds of maixe
heads, five pounds of cane hay,
which will, all told amount to not over
14c, and should produce to 1
pound of butter fat, S2c per pound.
The skim milk of an average cow
should he worth about 8c a day and
the manure on the farm about 1 a
month. Thus an average cow, in
cluding her calf is worth about 7.05
ier month. The general care will
amount to about 1."0 per month.,
leaving a net profit of 0.1ft pe'
month, or "3 per year.
Feeding at home kects all the fer
tility on the farm, and it is estimated
that a ton of alfalfa contains about
10 worth of fertility, while a ton of
butter fat that is sold off the farm
is warth only -ISe in fertility value.
These are practical thoughts by a
practical man.
