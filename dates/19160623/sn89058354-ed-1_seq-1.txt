Redpath Lecturer Also Advises
. Removal of , Court Yard
Fence In Order To Make
Paris More Beautiful. Pa
risians Learn Many Things
About City From Stranger.
Hands City Deserved
Knocks and Some Bouquets.
"Blast the city scales on the
public square and remove the
court yard fence," was the ad
vice offered the people of Paris
by Allen D. Albert, who lectured
at the Chautauqua tent Tuesday
night on "The Forces That Make
Cities," handing this city some
bouquets and likewise some
brick-bats.
Mr. Albert's address was very
interesting and he told the audi
ence many things about their
city that they did not know, al
though, as he stated, he had
lived here less than a day.
While condemning the court
yard fence and'" he scales recent
ly put in on th South side of thc
square, as well as other things,
the speaker congratulated the
city upon the fact that it had one
of the few light and power com
panies, under municipal owner
ship, that pays, and upon the
fact that there is no red-light
district in the city.
Mr. Albert declared it & shame
that Paris has not a better health
system, and said that the city
health officer was paid the
"magnificent" salary of $50. per
year.
While none oppose the erection
of public scales there has been
considerable opposition to the
city putting them on the public
square, and since Mr. Albert's
condemnation of this action, some
have declared that the scales
should be removed, and a few
have gone so far as to say that a
petition, declaring the scales a
nuisance, should be filed in order
to get tham removed, provided
this object cannot be accomplish
ed otherwise. It has been point
ed out that it would have been
much better to' have erected
these scales in the rear of the
city hall, on the alley; that they
would leave been more convenient
there and would not be so much
in the wav of passers, wagons,
buggies, and auto mobiles on the
streets.
Numerous other evils were
condemned by Lecturer Albert,
notably the lack of fire escapes
and other protection against
flames at the school buildings,
and the location of -the Robert E.
Lee school "the only school
building I have ever seen that
does not face some street."
Mr. Albert also declared very
strongly in favor of a public park,
public playgrounds for the chil
dren and support of the proposed
local hospital.
This lecture was one of the
features of this year's Chautau-
nsoner:
ANXIOUS FOR SERVICE
Enthusiastic Meeting Is Held
At Court House On Last
Monday Night
MILITIAMEN WILL NOT BE
MUSTERED IN UNTIL JULY 1
Captain Weldon Communicates
With Adjutant-General
Rogan By Phone
Members of the militia com
pany recently organized at Paris
are anxious for service on the
Mexican border, and are waiting
impatiently for July 1 to arrive,
on which date they will be mus
tered in.
An enthusiastic meeting was
held at the court house Monday
night, after which the soldier
boys engaged in some drill prac
tice and military training, under
the direction of the captain, J.
D. Weldon.
Capt. Weldon also got into
communication with Adjutant
General C. B. Rogan by tele
phone and offered the services
of the local militiamen in con
nection with President Wilson's
recent call for the national guard
for service along the Mexican
border.
However, since the local com
pany will not muster in until
July 1, the boys will probably
not be included in the first call
for service' but hope to be or
dered out when the second call
is made.
Before being taken to Nash
vill, where they will be muster
ed in for federal service, the
boys will take the new oath re
quired by the United States.

New York Store building failed
to turn his water hydrant off,

met with hearty public approvat.

William Rainy Bennett, "The
Man Who Can;" the Weather

In Ifeico
Negro Shoots
Wife Dead At
Late Hour Of
Night, Is Held
In the presence of his 10 year
old son, Spence Cavitt, negro,
shot and instantly killed his
wife at her home in the old
Twelfth district of this county,
near the Weakley county line,
on Thursday night of last week,
was arrested by a Weakley coun
ty deputy sheriff on Friday,
given a preliminary hearing and
held without bond on a charge
of first degree murder.
According to the story the boy
told officers, his father and
mothor had been separated for
sometime and on Thursday night
his father, Cavitt, who had been
living in Weakley county, came
to his mother's home and de
manded that she let him have
their children. The boy said his
mother refused and started to
close the door on the man, when
he pulled a gun and shot her to
death and ran. Tha boy and a
negro man who was on the place
spread a sheet over the dead
woman and went to the home of
a neighbor. All of the negroes
refused to go to the scene of the
tragedy that night, and the body
was allowed to remain until the
following day when Deputy
Sheriff G. P. Hays was notified
and went to the house. The
body was removed and later
buried.
Deputy Hays notified Sheriff
T. M. Hagler of the killing and
stated that it was believed that
Cavitt had returned to Weakley
county. Sheriff Hagler called
the sheriff of Weakley county
by phone and told him of the
murder. The Weakley county
sheriff notified one of his deputies
near the Henry-Weakley county
line, and within two hours Cavitt,
although protesting his inno
cence, was under arrrst.
After a preliminary hearing,
at which he was held to await
the action of the grand jury on k
charge of murder in the first de
gree, Cavitt was placed in jail.
While he denied his guilt, the boy
states postively that his father
killed his mother. Cavitt claims
he was not in Henry county on
the night of the tragedy, it is
understood.

ing painfully bruised. He was
taken to his home and Dr. G. T.
Abernathy called in. About 25
stitches were necessary to close
the cut in his thigh. If the cut
had been an inch longer the main
artery would have been severed,
and Baggett might have bled to
death. He was resting very well
at last reports.
