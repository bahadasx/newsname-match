Changes Resolution, Putting
Responsibility on Congress.
With Republicans, led by Con
gressman Mann, demanding ex
plicit expression from the Presi
dent as to his reasons for sending
the militia to the border and with
power to order them into Mexico,
Chairman Hay, of the House Mili
tary Affairs Committee, this after
noon began .his fight to make the
national guard actually a Federal
force.
Opposition to the resolution be
cause President Wilson ias not
appeared before Congress in per
ion to explain the Mexican situa
tion seemed to grow rapidly.
Congressman Gardner of Mas-
tachusetts asked that the whole
natter be postponed for consider
ation '.until .tomorrow, but Chair
nan Hay pressed for immediate
tonsideration.
Hay asked the .House to con
lept to changes in the Resolution,
h cffeciTpfecing on Congres the
responsibility or drafting the mi
litia. .
DRAFT CHANGED..
While the original draft read, "that,

Jnlted Stales the President ii hereby
tutnoripjd to draft Into the military

nembera of the national guard to serve

his language should be changed to 'the
bllowlng:

tency now exists which demands- the

Continuing, Congressman Mann said:

vldent that the troops cannot remain
b the heart of their country without

I do not wart this to be an exception.
"it Is tho patriotic duty of Washing
ton men to enlist at this time, and to
encourage their friends to do likewise.
If one-twentieth of those who marched
lit the preparedness parade on June 14
would enlist, we would have enough
men to bring our organizations up to

"Reports from the recruiting officers
show that numbers of men are Joining
the guard, but the enlistments are not
coming In fast enough."

MRS. WILSON TO GET
PORTRAIT OF HUSBAND
A llfe-elred portrait of President
Wilson, painted by the late Qustav
C. Langenberg, for the Chamber ot
Commerce of Hamburg, Germany, for
presentation to the Kaiser, Is to be
presented Instead to Mrs. Wilson,
wife of the President, according to
plans being made by a committee oi
women which has aoqulred the por
trait. Owing to the war, the negotiations
between the executors of the artist
and the Hamburg Chamber of Com
merce had to be dropped, and the
picture was acquired by a committee
headed by Mrs. John Bherwyn Crosby,
organiser of many women's Demo
crcratlo clubs, and Mrs. Nathan
Strause, both of New York. The com
mittee plans to present It to Mrs.
Wilson some, time next month.
The portrait, valued at between
$15,000 and 120.000, Is now on exhi
bition at the office of the committee,
27 West Eighty-second street, New
York. An appeal for funds Is being
matte, as the committee desires to

Terry. It consists of three officers and
eignty-nv men.
"The Slanal Corns, however, could
profitably employ the services of sev
eral good telegraphers," said General
Harvey. "Any men with experience as
telegraphers would be welcomed into
the Signal Corps. Captain Terry has
a set of good operators now, but In
the field he cannot htve too many for
the many duties devolving upon him."
The two batteries of field artillery
need sixty men to recruit up to war
strength, while the cavalry troop, which
now has ninety-three men, should have
at least ten more.
Geutral Harvey estimates that GOO re
cruits are needed to bring the Infantry,
machine gun company, supply company
and hospital corps up to war strength.
To War in' Automobile.
"Send them to war In an auto!"
This Is the cry of the civilian organi
zations helping out the national guard
officers in whooping up the recruiting
campaign that began today In whirl
wind fashion.
"A call for automobile ownera should
bo etnt out with a request that they
donate the use of their machines for
one trip to Port Myer each day," said
one of the heads of this organization
this morning. "That wouldn't toko
much time. In Washington there are
thousands of automobile owners. who
could spare their cars. The trip to the
fort and return will take about an
hour out ot their day. Let them re
port to the various recruiting stations
an they see fit."
The recruiting officers cannot take of

EXCITEMENT IN CAPITAL
Business Men, However, Don't
Think U. S. Would Antago

MEXICO CITY, June 23. Al
though armed conflict with' the
United States is now regarded as
not improbable, the Mexican peo
ple still hope for a settlement of
the controversy by diplomatic ne
gotiations. Yesterday was observed as a
holiday in the capital, being tha
religious festival of Corpus
Christ!.
Business was suspended gener
ally. The streets and parks were
crowded.
The people talked nothing but
the likelihood of a break with the
United States.
Mexico City business men in
terviewed by the United Press ex
pressed disbelief thai the United
States would' risk destroying her
friendly relations with 'Latin
American countries after laboring
so hardlo establish. thsi, by
conflict with Mexico. ,
.WQULD-JaROUSE 'HOSTILITY:!
They believe that tha American. Gov
erhment reallaet that tha Invasion jot
Mexico would arouse hostility against
the United States throughout central
and South America, endangering. If not
rulntrig, tho trade collections of Ameri
can merchants and manufacturers. In
fact, all classes of people seem to be
lieve that some way will be round out
of the difficulty without a permanent
breach of friendly relations.
The proclamation issued by War
Minister Obregon, calling upon all who
have been In arms against the govern
ment to abandon that attitude and Join
the Corransa forces in cose of war with
the Unlfed States, is expected to bring
general response.
Those who have been declared out
laws by Carranta are excluded from
the call. Those who do not accept the
call will be considered outlaws.
ObregorwcaJled attention to the fact
that opposition leaders in the states ot
Coahuila, Chihuahua, Ouranga, Zac
atecas, and elsewhere already have
recognized the constitutionalist govern
ment, thus setting tho example for
otners.
REFUGEESTLOCK TO
PORT OF VERA CRUZ
Arrival of Americans Fails to
Bring About Excitement.
VERA CRUZ, Juno 23.-Arrivol of
hundreds of American refugees here to
day, flcotng before war clouds, failed
to bring any unusual excitement to
Mexico's principal seaport.
The native residents are optimistic.
The refugee unite in declaring the
crowds which greeted them at railroad
stations on their trip here were fairly
courteous.
Out In the harbor today the battleship
Nebraska was lying peacefully at an
chor, with close on 200 American citi
zens aboard. The Nebraska's officers
have endeared tliemsslves to the refu
gees by the'r hospitality but they ore
mighty anxious for the arrival of a
transport which will relieve them of
the civilians aboard. A transport for
the refugees Is expected within twenty
four or fortv-clsht hours.
A train from Mexico City late last
night brought several score Americans
and stveral hundred other foreigners.
Not ono of these had anything but the
highest rraisu for the courtesy and po
lite treatment accorded them by con-'
stltutlonallst troops and officers both
In Mexico Cltv and en route.
Twelve carloads of American refugees,
under euro of Special Agent Rodgers,
were expected from the capital some
time todtw.
The hotals, pottals, and cafes of eVra
Crux wero ulivi with Americans today.
For the most part they were in good
spirits and hopeful of an amicable ad
justment of the difficulties between the
two governments.

BORDER FEARS FOR
AMBUSHED CAVALRY
Nothing Heard From Details Sent
to Resist Carranzistas.
EL PASO, Tex., Juno 23. The fate
ot Capt. Lewis O. Morey'a cavalry de
tachment 'which was In the Carrizai
fight, and the (possibility that the squad
ron of the Eleventh Cavalry sent to
their relief has also been engaged by
the Carranzistas, caused the gravest
anxiety in official circles here today.
Nothing has been heard from Morey'a
men since they were lured Into ambush
Wednesday, and cut up by machine gun
fire. General Pershing has arranged to
re-enforce the relief column if It Is at
tacked by the vastly superior number
of Carranzistas In tho Carrizai district.
The absence or any aeroplanes with
the American expedition in Mexico was
the basis or considerable criticism here
today. Aviators in swift flying machines
could have learned tho truth about the
Carrizai situation almost Immediately.
All aeroplanes Intended for scouting
with Pershing are dismantled at the
Columbus base undergoing repairs.

WILSON DELAYS
ACTION PENDING
PERSHING REPORT
Decides, With Approval of Cabinet, No
Move Shall Be Made In Mexican Situ
ation Until Official Facts of Car
rizai Fight Are at Hand. .
ALL MILITIA ORDERED TO BORDER
Tentative Arrangements Made By State
Department for British Legation at
Mexico City to Take Over U. S.
Interests In Case of War
EL PASO, Tex., June 23. Repels received to
day by American mining companies from. Mexican
sources stated that Troops C and K of the Tenth United
tates Cavalry, were practically annihilated in the fight
ing at Carrizai, when led into the Carranzuta 'trap.
There is no official confirmation of this report.
At the conclusion of today's Cabinet meeting it was
stated triat in the absence of an official report from General
Pershing on the Carrizai incident, no decision had been
reached as to the course of action.
The Cabinet had before it a few fragmentary reports
concerning the clash, but nothing, it was stated, which
would Justify a conclusion. ,
1 . It was denied that the tabinet had taken up the ques
tion of calling out volunteers.
Secretary of War Baker later Issued orders to every
department commander to send his militia forces to the
border as rapidly as he can equip them.
"The Administration," he said, "is still awaiting in
formation." No change of policy, it was declared, has been deter
mined upon.
Tentative arrangements have been completed by the
State Department for the British legation at Mexico City
to take over American interests in the event of hostilities
between the United States and Mexico.
WOULD RECALL SPECIAL AGENT RODGERS.
Special Agent James Linn Rodgers, of the State De-'
partment, who is now representing the American Govern
ment there, would be recalled at once, unless Carranza
should anticipate such action by handing him his passports.
At present Mr. Rodgers is arranging for the transpor
tation of Americans from the Mexican capital to Vera Cruz
by special trains.
Should thebreak come, Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican
ambassador-designate here, also would either be recalled or
given his passports.
In the meantime the President is marking time pending
the receipt of Pershing's official report on the Carrical inci
dent and the mobilization of the national guard.
Ten thousand national guardsmen from the western
and central departments will be rushed to the border as soon
as they are ready to entrain.
MIUTIA REPORTS NOT ENCOURAGING.
But reports which have been received at the War De
partment are far from encouraging as to when any consider
able number of the State militia troops will be in shape.
, While there is every disposition to praise the militia
men who have responded to the call many of them men
of family who have given up needed employment to go to
the front because of the system many of these men are
physically unfit, more of them improperly trained, and
most of the organizations are far short of the minimum
strength required of them before being mustered into th
Federal service.
- ' OFFICERS DREAD SACRIFICES.
Army officers dread the sacrifices
that would have, to follow If they were
compelled to throw raw men into the
field In a country where the rigors of
cllmotc In the summer are often far
more deadly than bullets or. the enemy.
Consequently these otricers would pre
fer before sending the men Into action
to train and acclimate them to border
service.
The Administration, apparently con
scious of these1 handicaps', seems deter
mined not to precipitate matters and
to avoid any draatlo action, If It can
be avoided, at least until the mllltla is
In ,h.lU
Despite the denials In official quarters
that any conslderaUon la being given to
the colling out of volunteers, members
of Congress generally expect that the
first step. In trie event of an outbreak of
war, would be tho appearance of the
President before Congress to ask per
mission to tall out several hundred
thousand volunteers,
The War Department Is still awaiting
the official report from Pershing. With
out It tho Cabinet, which met today In
a lengthy session, was unable to agree
definitely oil the Hteps to be taken, It la
understood.
Reports to the Btate Department today
indicated that difficulties were being ex
perienced by Americans In the state of
Guanajuato, south of Mexico City, In
getting out, but there was nothing to
show the reason.
Rodgera imported that 150 more Ameri
cans left Mexico City yesterday on tho
