until the harmony of it three days'
session bad been rippled with a row
over the auffrage plank.
No voice waa raised against the
declarations of the AmricanUm plank.
At one time it looked as if the suffrage
plank had been lost but after Senator

considered it vital to party success it
was voted into the platform, 8881 to
181. The whole platform theiwwaa
adonted without roll call.
As it went into the piauorm tne
uffraee plank stands:
We favor the extension 01 tne

aa to the men." . '
The women auffrage leaders consid

all their force behind it and won the
upport of tha administration leaders,
who were found fighting for them
when danger threatened.

speaker's stand to read the document

CONVENTION ACTS
IN HARMONY
Coliseum, St Louis President Wil
son and Vice President Marshall were
nominated by acclamation late Thurs
day night by the Democratic National
convention, the ticket being completed
four minute before Friday.
Contrary to expectation, however,
the convention did not finish its work,
because the . platform waa not ready,
and it met again at 11 o'clock Friday
morning, - v s",
It was announced in the convention
that the sub-committee drafting the
platform bad finished it work, but
that the entire resultion committee
was not assembled to pass upon it and
it waa not known when that could be
dona..
President Wilson' own plank,
charging conspiracy among some for
eign-born citixena for the benefit of
the foreign powers and denouncing any
political party which benefit and not
repudiating such a situation, waa in
corporated in the platform just aa the
President himself bad aent tt Irom
Washington. It waa understood that
tha President insisted that the plank
should be put in the platform in the
way be bad drawn it
There never waa any doubt 01 treat'
dent Wilson' nomination, but there
hraa a possibility that soma vice-presi
dontial booms might be brought out in
opposition to Vice President Marshall,
They melted away. However, wnen
the convention got in session, and. a
soon a President Wilson's nomination
had been made a roaring chorus of ac
clamation. Senator Kara who re-nomi
nated Mr. Marshall, east aside a long
prepared speech and simply declared:
1 nominate Thomas Kiicy atarsnaii.
of Indiana, for vice president
To President . Wilson's nomination
there waa only one dissenting vote,
Robert Emmett Burke, of Illinois.
A striking incident of the session
waa the action of the convention in
callirur on William J. Bryan to speak,
This waa done on the motion of Sena
tor Thompson, of Kansas, that tha
rule be suspended and the ex-secre
tary be permitted to take the plat
form. The motion , waa carried and
Mr. Bryan waa escorted to the plat
form immediately.
He spoke 45 minute, pledging his
support to the President
Ireland.
"Raus mit him," roared a Baltimore
delegate and the convention hall
rocked with laughter.
The real fight broke immediately
after, however, when Governor Fer
guson, of Texas, who headed the mi
nority report against the administra
tion plank, was given SO minutes in
which to discuss it
The plank offered by the minority
was this:
"The Democratic party has always
stood for the sovereignty of the sev
eral states in the control and regula
tion of elections. We reaffirm the
historic position or our party tn this
regard and favor the continuance of
that wise provision of the federal con
stitution which vests in the several
states of the union the power to pre
scribe the qualifications of their elec
tora.". $50,000,000 Loan I Made.

A New Tool for Progressive farmers.
In the work for agricultural ad
vancement being carried forward
through so many diverse agencies in
all parte ef our country, the great need
ha been for some directory to the val
uable literature being issued in the
form of bulletins and periodicals.
The results of research carried on at
all the state experiment stations, pub
lished In tha form of bulletins, the
vast number of publications issued by
Federal departments and research
worker la universities, the miscellan
eous literature issued by state board
of agriculture, the varioue national
Delations for the advancement of ag
ricultural science and the improvement
of rural life, constitute the most au
thoritative and valuable library for
agricultural worker In existence to
day and may be bad for tha asking,
The on difficulty ba been the lack
of any ready-reference directory, kept
progressively up-to-date, that would
classify the daU thus aasembled and
aava a busy man tha labor of looking
through thousands of pamphlets to find
a stray bit of information. This great
need ia now being supplied by the new
cumulative index, issued through the
co-operative effort of the agricultural
collcarea and experiment stations. This
publication will provide an accurate
ready-reference guide to the moat val
uable current agricultural literature.
and will also index fuUy about fifty
popular farm papers and ecientifie
journals, selected by the librarians in
agricultural colleges as most useful lor
research workers and practical farm
er.
Any one who know bow to use a
dictionary wilt be able to find any in
formation desired in this index. All
the reference material relating to any
on topic can be found by toe simple
device of turning to the subject in ita
proper place in the alphabet The
publication baa been undertaken by the
H. W. Wilson Company, well-kno
publisbera of library guide to periodi
cal literature, and will be .issued five
times a year, each number will contain
all the references in earlier numbers
combined under one alphabet, and the
bound annual wiU provide a complete
directory to the moat valuable litera
ture, relating to agriculture and it
allied sciences, for the current year.
Every county agent every extension
worker, every investigator or writer
on agricultural subject, ana every
practical farmer wishing to keep in
touch with the beat available informa
tion being issued in tha form of
pamphieta and periodicals, should pro
vide himself with a copy of Una index.
It wiU multiply many fold the service
the library can give the rural commun
ity: it will make it possible for the
urban community to get an under
standing of tha farmer's problem, and
so nave tba way for an intelligent co
operation between town and country.
and it should stimulate tha study of
the scientific principle of agriculture
in the achooia. 1

actors Affecting the Duty of Water.
By W. L. Powers, Professor of Imga-
ticn ana urauisge, v. a. .
The amount of water required to irri
gate a given crop to maturity depends
on the soil and subsoil conditions, the
kind and variety of crops, and the
amount and distribution of rainfall as
well aa other weather condition. Less
water ia required where applied with
the furrow method and in deep furrows
or where the stand of the particular
crop grown is perfect in proportion to
the fertility of the land. The kind of
cultivation and the kind of ditches
used, whether broad or deep, affect the
total amount of water required. An
other important factor ia the skill of
the irrigator and. the method of pur
chase and use of the water. Leas
water is used where it is pumped or
where the irrigator pays in proportion
to the quantity used and where rota
tion ia practised in the use 01 water,
The above factors have been com
monly recognised in affecting duty of
water for year. Recently we have
come to realise the importance of crop
rotation, and the use of manure to
maintain the fertility and keep up the
water capacity of the soils so that the
plants will not need to drink aa much
water in securing the needed nourish
ment For example, on the College
Demonstration Farm near Redmond,
1912. an acre planted to potatoes re
ceived six acre-inches of irrigation.
One-half of this land waa treated with
potassium sulfate at the rate of one
pound per square rod, or at a cost of
about four dollar per acre. The un
fertilised plat yielded 147 bushels, or
24.5 bushels per acre-inch. The fer
tilised plat yielded 235 bushel per
acre, or 39.1 bushela per acre inch. In
all cases where fertiliser waa used on
this farm, it resulted in decidedly
more economical returns per acre-inch
of water used. Meadowa require rela
tively large amounts of water; grain
but moderate quantities and cultivated
crops such as potatoes still less. The
time, amount and frequency of irriga
tion all affect the duty of water. These
constitute the largest practicable prob
lems of irrigation practice and deserve
special consideration.
Chehalla Creamery Votea Dividend.
Chehalis, Wash. T. J. Long has
been re-elected president of the board
of trustees of Lewis County Co-operative
Creamery. Charles GesselL of
Forest waa chosen to suecede himself
as vice-president and C B. Perkins as
secretary-treasurer. The organisation
voted a 6 per cent dividend on ita is
sued stock. During the past year tne
creamery turned out butter fat to the
amount of 232,000 pounds, selling in

ncreasing Cost of Gasoline
Is Blamed On Standard Oil
Washington. D. C. The Federal
Trade commission concluded Wednes

gasoline prices, ending a two days'
hearing after representativea of Stand
ard Oil and various independent com

industry. A report, based on the
hearings and on the results of weeks
of investigation by the commission a
agents, will be made public soon and
will be transmitted to congress in
response to a resolution asking for an
inquiry.
The independent jobbers and reoners
who appeared before the commission
were virtually unanimous in placing
responsibility for the increases on the
Standard Oil companies, who, tney
charged, had refused to compete and
fixed prices. Standard Oil represent

the wheat situation in his state he said
that rust and bug are playing havoc
