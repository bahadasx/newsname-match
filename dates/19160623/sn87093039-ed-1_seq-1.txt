MAKING A FARCE OF
MEXICAN WAR BUGABOO
Why Not Arm Texans With Pop Guns
and Stuffed Clubs and Turn 'Em
Loose on Mexico
Is not the war scare with Mexico
becoming a huge joke?
Here we are calling for troops and
volunteers. Feverishly assembling
munitions, war vessels and troops on
the Mexican border just as if we were
threatened by a warlike nation, instead
of a half starved lot of beggars without
guns or amunition.
Mexico is bristling with 700 gen
erals and twice that number of colo
nels. Each general has an army of
about thirteen men, while the colonels
have from five to seven, all armed with
rusty sugar cane knives. Two years
ago war with the Mexicans might have
meant something. Then they had
something to eat and fight with. Now
they have nothing to fight with and are
half starved. Mexico can be whipped
by asking all the peons to throw down
their rusty weapons and come across
the line and get a square deal. All
they want is a few pounds of corn
meal and some red pepper to fill their
yellow hides and they will desert the
generals and colonels.
If the United states goes into spasms
over an opera Bouffe war like the Mex
ican joke, one can not help wondering
what would happen if we were threat
ened by a warlike nation like Germany.
It is to laugh.
Arm the Texans with pop guns and
provide each with a sack of meal and
some chilli to be used as a bait for the
peons and the war ought to come to
an end in thirty days with the loss of
very little blood.
The desperate way we are arming
and drilling to fight a Quixotic windmill
will make us the laughing stock "Df the
world. It makes one think of a great
big, six footer asking his neighbors to
help him clean out a dwarf of a man.
We have a regular army of 75,000
men, ten or fifteen thousand marines,
some hundred or more big and little
fighting ships, and now the persident
has called for a hundred thousand mi
litiamen and heaven knows how many
volunteers are being organized all over
the country. If we had a real war
instead of some half starved ragamuffins
to fight we would have to call out the
women to help.

The Troubles of Railroads
During the winter snow, slides and
ice gave the Great Northern no end of
trouble. Nor it is water and washouts.
This week the service from the east
was interrupted by high water in the
Kootenai river. The track follows the
river from Libby Montana, to Rexford
Idaho, a distance of one hundred miles,
and this week in many places the
track was from two to four feet under
water. Thru trains on the main line
i had to be abandoned until the water
went down.
LOOKING OUT A ROUTE
fOR RAILROAD UP ICICLE
Party of Five Arrived Here Yesterday
Morning and Immediately Left for
Head of Icicle River
Al Van Epps, Mr. Neilson and three
other men whose names we failed to
learn, arrived on the early morning
train yesterday and left town by 7:30
a. m., going up the Icicle river trail.
On their return this paper will en
deavor to learn so much of their plans
as they care to make public at this
time about the proposed railroad up
the Icicle river canyon to the mining
property on the head of Jack creek,
mention of which has been made in
the Echo in the past two weeks. In
the event the Icicle route is determined
on the people of Leavenworth may
confidently be expected to do all in
their power to help the project along.
FORESTRY NOTES
S. A. Blanfcpnship with three teams
and some twenty men is up on Blewett
pass road on the Chelan county side
carrying out road improvements that
were decided on the past year. Road
Overseer Parish is in the same vicinity
with teams and thirty or forty men.
Between them they will make this
much used road very much better than
it has been, and when all the work
that has been decided on is completed
it will compare with any mountain road
in the state. Some of the road in the
vicinity of Ingles creek will be com
pleted by the middle of July but that
part between the old Blewett mining
camp and the summit will not be
connected up with the old road until
some time next year.
Assistant Forest Supervisor Ramsdel
will complete the tree planting ud on
Pine creek this week where he has
been the past two weeks with a crew
of five or six men.
The first forest fire reported this year
broke out last Sunday on the Chewawa
river valley near what is known as Big
Meadows and burned over about 160
acres before it was subdued. The
rain of last Sunday night, says Forest
Supervisor Sylvester, helped very much
to keep down fires.
The telephone line from Blewett to
Tiptop mountain will be completed in
a short time and as an aid to report
fires in that section will be a great
help.
The Leavenworth branch of the W.
C. T. U. held a most interesting meet
ing at the Methodist church last Tues
day evening. A good crowd was in
attendance. Rev. Joseph Weiss, the
Congregational minister gave an inter
esting and instructive talk. Mrs.
Dunlap, of Seattle, a prominent W. C.
T. U. worker, delivered the address
of the evening. Special music was
given by the choir and Miss Mildred
Adams rendered a very pleasing solo.
The organization will hold another
meeting in July, probably at the Con
gregational church.

HIGH WATER IN RIVER
MAKES TROUBLE fOR CITY
Leaves and Trash Choke Pipes—Water
Cut Off One Day—Repairs
Promptly Made
The high water in the Wenatchee
river which came to an end last Sun
day, when the water began to recede,
caused expense to the city and annoy
ance and trouble to the consumers the
first of the week.
In some way the intake, located in
the Icicle river, four miles from town,
either washed out or was broken by
rocks so that leaves and trash entered
the mains and cut of! the water supply
the first of the week. On Monday it
was necessary in order to make repairs
to cut off the water entirely. Water
Commissioner Tolbert with his helper,
Wm. Gowing, worked night and day
to restore normal conditions, and by
Tuesday there was a plentiful supply
of water all over town. Mr. Tolbert
found that considerable silt and trash
had accumulated in the reservoir and
with a force of men, including City
Clerk Brown, flushed the reservoir and
gave it a thoro cleaning, working the
greater part of the night Monday. It
will be impossible to make permanent
repairs on the intake until the latter
part of the summer, when the river is
at a low stage. Mr. Tolbert thinks,
however, that the temporary repairs
made this week will insure a plentiful
supply of water, and having cleansed
the reservoir and taken all the precau
tions possible to prevent trash and im
purities getting into the mains that
there will be slight cause for complaint
from this time on.

Better Outlook for the Apple Growers
The report brought back last week
by Mr. J. B.Adams from Leavenworth,
'Mr. H. W. Otis from Peshastin, and
Mr. Barney Sugrue from Cashmere,
who represented the fruit growers from
the Upper Wenatchee Valley at the
Spokane meeting where final action
was taken in the organization of the
selling end of the industry is most en
couraging. It lends strength to the
belief that in the future the fruit busi
ness will be conducted with intelligent
forethot and something approximating
reasonable remuneration may be hoped
for. We wonder sometimes if in the
past the apple growers, in an unorgan
ized state, were not largely the vic
tims of, not circumstances alto
gether, such as large crops, but
designing and compactly organized
speculators. Some confirmation for
this belief is found in the ex
perience of the raisin growers of Cali
fornia. Before they formed that com
pact and efficient organization known
as the California Raisin Growers' Asso
ciation they went thru much the same
experience as the apple growers of the
northwest have had. Immediately fol
lowing their organization marketing
conditions, or prices, began to im
prove, and ever since raisin growing
has been fairly satisfactory. With this
in mind we dare hope that from this
time forward the app'e growers of the
northwest may look for better times.
Not a little of the success in putting
the Fruit Growing Agency, Inc., on
its feet is due to two months' active
and intelligent work on the part of C.
E. Bassett, of the Federal Bureau of
Markets. The resolution acknowledg
ing his helpful aid, passed by the
agency meeting last Saturday, was well
deserved.

EIRST AMERICAN CLASH
WITH MEXICAN TROUPS
News from Mexican Sources Indicate U.
S. Defeat- Official Report Awaited-17
Americans Taken Prisoner
An American troop composed of ne
gro cavalry under command of Capt.
Morey, a part of Gen. Pershing's com
mand, in violation of an order issued
the first of the week that U. S. troops
could only move in the direction of
the American border on Wednesday
while scouting in northern Chiahuahua
about 90 miles south of El Paso, ran
into what appears to have been an am
bush and some 12 American soldiers
were killed among them the commander
of the troop, and 17 taken prisoner.
There appears to have been an equal
or greater number of Mexicans killed
and wounded. Official details had not
been received up to Thursday evening
and was awaited with much interest.
The Mexican report is to the effect
that the U. S. soldiers were the agres
sors and fired the first shot. The Mex
icans had a machine gun which
accounts for the heavy American cas
ualties. An unofficial report from
American sources is to the effect that
the U. S. troops were deliberately led
into a trap. General unrest prevails
among citizens of both countries along
the border.
An immediate declaration of war
is not expected but in the meantime
more troops are being moved to the
border by both Mexico and the United
States. Pacificists are trying to bring
about a peaceable settlement but those
best informed believe that war will
result in a short time.
Poindexter and the Industrial
Relations Report
The Labor Union Record gives Sen
ator Miles Poindexter the main credit
for the publication by Congress of the
Federal Commission on Industrial Re
lations Report.
This was the Walsh Commission,
which sat in the principal cities of the
United States tn 1914 and split three
ways in their findings as to the trouble
between capital and labor.
The big interests tried tooth and nail
to discredit the report and prevent the
the circulation of the divergent ideas it
lays before the public.
But thanks to men like Poindexter,
the people appreciate more and moie
getting the facts instead of alleged con
clusions cooked up from facts carefully
concealed.
There would have been no Ludlow
horror if the American people had had
the facts of conditions in the Rocke
feller camps of Colorado. Public opin
ion would have prevented it.
Poindexter has rendered a lasting
service by compelling the publication
qf the greatest report on labor problems
ever prepared and suppressed by the
National Association of Manufacturers
(no doubt) the organized association
for profit and invisible government.
family Platform
Live within your means, save a
little money, acquire a little property.
Teach your children to not be
ashamed to work at any honest labor
and shun idleness.
Avoid if possible, having them grow
up with the idea of getting soft Jobs
from the public.
Prepare plain food at home instead
of buying high-priced canned stuff and
and delicatessen supplies.
Teach the girls to make their own
clothes, trim their own hats and keep
accounts of their expenses.
Let the family respect industries and
cultivate harmless and inexpensive
amusements.

THE BODY OF TONY MILLER
TAKEN FROM RIVER SUNDAY
Last of Five Killed in Slide Feb. 18, One
and Half Miles up the Canyon
Sara Daly discovered the body of a
man lodged against a trestle pier in
the Wenatchee river in the middle of
the L.-D- mill company's log pond
last Sunday and with the help of Dr.
Judah, whom he notified, recovered
the body. It was considerably decom
posed but easily identified as that of
Tony Miller, an Italian laborer who
was killed in the slide one and one
half miles up the canyon, west of town,
on the 18th of February last. One
body, that of a Japanese, was recovered
shortly after the slide occurred, two
others were recovered since and Tony
makes the third. He was a large mus
cular man and was quite noted among
the workers for his great strength.
His relatives have been here on several
occasions and made search for the
body but always unsuccessfully. It is
presumed that the body was held down
by debris and only released when the
high water came. Whether the rela
tives have been notified and the body
held for them or interred we have not
learned.
Things Dairymen Should Know
According to A. J. Lashbrook, field
dairy specialist at the State College,
there are approximately 234,000 dairy
cows in the state of Washington whose
average annual production of butter-fat
is ISO pounds each, while the cost
of feed is such that it requires a pro
duction of close to 200 pounds of
butter-fat each to cover the expenses
of feeding a cow for a year.
The owners of these cows must bear
a big loss each year. By keeping herd
records, building silos, having pure
bred sires at the head of herds th's
condition will be more likely to be
rectified. Keep a record of what your
cows are producing and you can see
in a short time which are money makers
and which are "boarders." The board
ers in a dairy herd had better be sold
for beef for they only eat up profits.
Every ranch owner who expects to
keep cows for the purpose of producing
butter fat should make preparations to
put in a silo. Now is the time to make
your preparation to put up winter feed.
Experience has shown that ensilage is
not ODly the best feed but it is also
the cheapest feed. By all means ar
range to build a silo. The health of
your cows will be improved, the milk
flow wiil be larger and your butterfat
returns increased.
Good dairy cows are not made by
feed or care. They are secured by
proper breeding. Employ nothing
but the best sires (or breeding purposes.
If you have not a good bull of your
own go to your neighbor. If your
neighbor has none two or three should
club together and buy a registered
and proved animal.
