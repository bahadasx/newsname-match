REDS LOOK FOR NATIONAL LEAGuTtROPHY
Important Cogs in Wheel pf Cincinnati Reds.
Tho baseball enthusiasts of Cincin
nati see visions of a pennant floating
before their gaze this season. Tho
team that represents that city on the
diamond this year Is acknowledged to
be abut tho fastest that Porkopolls
has ever seen. Competent Judges of
baseball ability who have seen tho
Reds in action during the training trip
and In tho championship games thus
far declaro that the speed and power
displayed are no mere flash In the pan.
Cincinnati fans have waited 33 years
for tho Rods to win a National loague
Hag. They may be forced to wait still
longer, hut this looks like the year for
the team to desert its old haunts and
I J Mil the first division clubs,
Garry Herrmann, tho president of
the Reds, certainly made a tenstrike

against Federal league players and
signed Hal Chase to play tlrBt base.

Ho has tried In the past many a
play which failed to go through sim

grasp tho situation as quickly as he.
Working with such c.cn as Charity

With a man on first base, Chaso may
bo depended upon to knock the ball to
right field. John J. McGraw, manager
of tho Giants, declares the ability to
perform Just that feat the greatest
recommendation for any battor.
One of the strongest reasons for the
optimism of tho Cincinnati fans Is tha
pitching staff cf the Reds. There Is
Fred Taney, who ranked second to
Grover Cleveland Alexander last sea
son, allowing an average of 1.57 earned
runs tc tho game, Jean Dale Is an
other clover, resourceful pitcher, whi
ranked hlfrh last year.
Pete Schneider and F. G. McKenery
are two ycung pitchers whj are highly
praised by tall players. Earl Moseley
and Lefty Schulz, who saw service In
tho American league before they
hopped to the Feds, should bo of as
6lstanco too.
'"Second base may be the weak spot
in the Reds thla year. At present Dill
Louden Is filling the post, and filling
It In acceptable fashion, but Dill Is a
veteran of long standing, and may
weaken under hard campaigning.
Charley Herzog, at shortstop, needs
neither Introduction nor defense.

among the third basemen, and, bettet
than mere mechanical ability, ho Is an
Intelligent player.

"Mike" Mowrey has become a big
favorite with Dodger "fans."
"Hank" Gowdy will play better ball
than ever this year, It Is thought.
Miller Hugglns says he has given
up hope of making his pitchers good
buntors.
In tho National league the Pirates
threaten to give the Giants a tussle
for last position.
It looks like Larry Lajole will have
tho "Just one more great year" he
wants beforo he quits.
The Indians have made a wonderful
record on their heme grounds this
year In drawing out tho fans.
a
"Bill" Louden, last year with the
Buffalo Feds, is the talk of Cincin
nati, where he is playing second base.
There must have been a flea In the
ointment that John McGraw mixed up
for the Giants at the start of the sea
son. Connie Mack says the Athletics will
make 'em step some Just a3 soon as
they acquire tha habit of using safety
razors.
Georgo Stallings vercame the dan

he released tho Shannon twins at the

EASIER FOR UMPIRES
FANS DO NOT RIDE THEM, AS IN
DARK AGES OF BASEBALL.
Attacking Arbiter Verbally and Some
times Physically on Every Close
Decision Was Deemed Prero
gative of Players.
The senseless pastime of umpire
baiting is becoming a relic of the dark
ages of baseball.
In former years attacking the um
pire verbally, and sometimes physi
cally, on every close decision was con
sidered the prerogative of managers
and players, while many scribes ali
bied for their defeats by blaming the
poor Judge of play.
That time passed long ago and In
telligent players today realize that
nothing is gained and much may be
lost by getting into rows with the um
pire, who is In full charge ot the game
on tho field and Is as essential to the
pastime as the players themselves.
Any fair man who knows the big
league umpires will have to acknowl
edge that they are a fair-minded and
conscientious set ot men, anxious to
do their duty to the best of their abil
ity, playing no favorites and giving
each decision as it comes up exactly
as they see It.
Umpires, as a rule, are much fairer
than ball players. The latter will try
to work every small advantage, will
resent the slightest criticism of their
work, no matter how well-founded it
may be, and will alibi for themselves
and one another In the boldest man
ner. Umpires, on the other hand, are, as
a rule, very fair and willing to admit
making a mistake. Their position is
a difficult one. The umpire behind
the plate, calling balls and strikes, as
well as making all decisions at the
plate and sometimes at third base, is
called upon to render as many as 150
decisions In the course of a single
game. The big majority of these he
gives accurately. In proportion to
the number of chances he has, his
mistakes are much fewer than those
of the ball players, who miss 5 or 10
per cent of their chances in the field
and make errors ot Judgment at the
bat

lie to those who have been mourn
ing that his baseball sun has set. The
big Indian never looked better and
has shown up well this spring.
Two Records Beaten.
Two records already have boon
broken In the American league. The
St. Louis Browns have won a game In
Chicago and the Washington team has
won a game In Boston. Neither team
was able to cop a contest on the
grounds of the opposition named last
season.
Hans Lobert I Through.
Sentiment among his team mates is
that ''Hans" Lobert will be unable to
get his Injured knee In shape again
and that be probably has played his
last game with tha Giants.

GRAVEST PERIL
TO THE SOLDIER
Concealed Marksmen Deal Death
With Consistency, Rarely
Missing Victim.
DISGUISE BAFFLES ENEMY
Remarkable Ingenuity Displayed In
Methods of Concealment Adopted
A Second's Pause In an Exposed
Section of the Line Spells
Death to the Soldier.
London. While the charge, the
bursting of shells and the hand-to-hand
combats make up to a great extent the
picture of war, one of the gravest dan
gers which the soldiers face in the field
is the bullet of the sniper. They are
the clever marksmen who select some
position where they are almost Invis
ible to their opponents and send a well
directed bullet at each target which Is
exposed for a fraction of a minute.
Remarkable as examples of the In
genuity ot these snipers are some of
the stories of their methods of dis
guise which are related by the soldiers
who return from the trenches, A
number of such stories were recently
compiled by an English newspaper and
give an Insight Into this method ot
warfare an art which has been raised
bo high that a moment's torgetfulness,
a second's pause In an exposed section
of the line spells death to the soldier.
"A Tommy, recently returned home,
tells an extraordinary story ot the In
genuity and death ot a German sni
per," says the newspaper. "This par
ticular sniper was encountered on Hill
Seventy. When dawn broke the sol
dier was chilled to the bone and weak
ened with loss of blood, as he had been
wounded the night before. Unable to
move, he lay flat on his back and tried
to get some sleep. The rest and the
warmth of the sun revived the soldier
and he raised up hta head. Another
wounded soldier started to walk back
to the trenches. A moment later he
pitched forward, shot through the tem
ple by a sniper.
Grass Arouses Suspicion.
"Five minutes later another man
moved. He started to get to his feet,
but seemed startled by something and
lay down again quickly. The other
wounded man followed his example.
A moment later he saw the grass,
about twenty yards away, move In a
peculiar manner. Instead of moving
sideways as It would from a body pass-'
ing through it, the grass Itself ap
peared to be coming forward.
"For a minute the movement of the
grass stopped and then it began again,
this time coming toward the wounded
soldier. Suspicion was now aroused
to such an extent that the soldier final
ly took aim at the moving tuft of grass
and fired three volleys in rapid suc
cession. Crawling over to the spot
where the mound of grass had sud
denly stopped twitching, he found a
dead German sniper. Real sods ot
grass had been bound by cords to a
waterproof sheet, which had been
strapped to the sniper's back, making
a perfect disguise for him."
Continuing Its anecdotes ot the
snipers, the newspaper quotes from
a long letter written by a soldier, in
which he explains the dangers present
ed to the men by the snipers.
"Along one stretch of front," he
says, "we were much puzzled by the
angle at which the sniper's bullets
were coming over. On the left was a
line of leafless pollard willows, but we
could see that there was nobody be
hind the trunks.
URGES GIRLS TO PREPARE

New York. Miss Kathleen Burke,
who has served on several of the Eu
ropean battlefronts, addressed a gath
ering of young women of the Vaca
tion association in New York, and
dwelt upon the part that women play
In the alleviation of suffering and the
horror at the war now going on.
Miss Burke is honorary secretary ot
the Scottish .Woman's hospital, and
told ot the work being done in Belgi
um, Serbia and France by the five
units of the hospital corps. A sixth
unit, to be known as the American
unit, because money from this coun
try paid for the equipment, is about
to go out within a tew weeks. Miss
Burke has been decorated by three
countries. She has seen service on
several battle lines, and only recently
returned from the Island of Corsica,
where she had helped In the work ot
attending 6,000 refugees. In Serbia
her unit battled with typhus. They
"Several of our officers tried to find
a solution, but all to no purpose. At
last Captain X , who happened to
be familiar with the ways of old wil
lows, took charge and ordered three'
men to fire a few shots at each willow.
The sniping ceased. Two of the wil
lows were hollow and the Germans
had crept Inside the treen and were
filing through cracks in the stem with
automatic revolvers. For two days
there was no more sniping, but on the
third the Are was resumed as briskly
as before and with Just as deadly an
effect. Fire was opened again on the
willows, but this time there was no re
sult. Steel Plate In Hollow Tree.
"Captain X was Just as suspici
ous as ever, and he Instructed the
nearest battery to make short work
of the willows. This was done, and
the third to go revealed the enemy's
cunning. Inside the willow we found
not only a German but a steel plate
which fitted outside hm and Inside
the willow, making a proof against rifle
bullets.
"While that was a clever trick It
was little better than the work done
with the old door. At one spot where
our trenches were not more than 100
yards apart an old door was lying.
The top glass panels of It were broken,
the wood beneath them was broken
and over the woodwork a gaudy paper
had been pasted. Its only use was as
a test for our sights, which we got
by hitting the door knob or breaking
off a splinter of glass.
"One day, however, we were sur
prised to find that when a bullet struck
the glass It left a white streak and
brought no tinkle. Hitting the wood
work had the same effect; it brought
a while smear, but no splinters. We
knew something was wrong and that
night decided to investigate. We dis
covered that the old door had been
removed and a steel shield put in its
place. It was painted to look like the
wood, paper and broken glass, with a
hole near the knob for the sniper's
rifle.
"We fixed a surprise for the artist.
He evidently thought he was going to
have things his own way. The next
day when he began his work we were
ready for him. Our trick certainly was
a match for his. We did our act,
for we sent both the artist and his
picture flying back into the German
trenches, and the picture was the more
Intact of the two. A well-placed bomb
' accounted for him.
"We caught another sniper In a curi
ous manner a few months ago. Our
regiment was stationed about eight
hundred yards from the Oerman
trench and, like all others, we suffered
much for want of water. Half a mile
In the rear ran a small stream and the
men used to steal out at night for wa
ter. These men were constantly being
sniped.
"A number of our men had been
killed or wounded in this manner and
it was agreed that the sniping came
from somewhere behind our lines. A
close day's search revealed nothing.
The C. O. was getting savage and his
attitude obviously demanded that he
must do something special for the
benefit of the undiscovered sniper.
"Early one morning the command
came that we were to make a great
circle and beat Inward, not leaving a
bit of ground uncovered. Nothing came
ot It that is to say, nothing except
a shapeless old French farmer whom
we found driving his riding plow tor
potatoes. When we questioned him he
flew Into a rage because we were tram
pling his beloved ground and demand
ed that we clear off at once as there
was no 'esplon'-around.
"We had to do so. In making his
report to our chief the subaltern re
marked reflectively as he told of how
the farmer gnashed his teeth at us,
'Jolly line teeth, and clean, too.'
"'What?' snapped the irate C. O.
'Mr. X , you will take a couple of
men and go to the old farmer. Engage
him In conversation while your men
pin him from behind suddenly. I don't
want to lose men capturing a danger
ous sniper with clean teeth.'

Mayor Advocates More Kleaing.
Hairlsburg, Pa. Mayor E. Z. Meals,
who recently sanctioned "spooning" in
the parks of the city, declared young
men and women should do more kiss
ing. "It would mean more marriages
and more homes; husbands and wives
should kiss whenever possible; it
would mean fewer divorce." The
mayor, who Is a physician, advised the
girls that It waa folly to refrain from
kissing because of germs, and that
kissing sent few people to the hos
pitals. German i tgiments have chiropodists

"Thla was a sharp Mow at the sutx
altern, but it was precise as our chief
suggested. The old farmer fought like
a tiger, and the three' men were rolling
over and over on the ground before
he could be safely tied. He was a
powerful young man and a search re
vealed a belt of cartridges and two
automatic pistols of German make.

"Don't think that the sniping Is con
fined to one side. We have some men
who are very clever, particularly the
Canadian chaps. One such is a full
blooded Indian In the Canadian Infan
try, who Is a marvel with his rifle. He
has a telescopic sight attached to his
rifle and goes about as he likes. He
Is a most silent man, talking to few
persons. He wanders about tha
trenches and waits for a chance to pick
off a German.
"One German sniper recently was
giving a lot of trouble. Officers with
glasses tried in vain to locate him.
The Indian came along and without
saying a word to anyone fired at a big
tree. Down dropped the sniper. The
Indian saw with his naked eye what
the officers with their glasses failed to
discover. He puts a little nick In the
stock ot his rifle every time he Is sure
he has killed a German. I saw him
add two more nicks to the thirty-eight
already on his stock."
