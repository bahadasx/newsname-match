COMING
PROJECT IMPROVEMENTS.
I ine t'ccos water users Associa
tion ha been working for soma days
upon a schema to put an alfalfa mill,
to be connected with a cotton seed oil
mill and small flour mill on the Carls-.
bad project j
Scott Etter, secretary and treasurer ;
has had personal charge of the gen- I
tlemen who came here from Oklaho
ma to look the Meld over for this pur-1
pose and a careful examination of the ;
acreage of cotton, wheat and alfalfa
has been made during the present :
week.
The scheme now contcmplutcd is one
that will put a first clnss cotton gin
at rlshad. Loving unci Otis. I
The parties interested will be fullv
able to pay a cash basis for cotton
1 and cotton seed.
The seed will be bought at market
price and converted into cotton seed
' nil cake and by products, right here in
. Carlsbad.
This will save shipping the seed out
to a mill and then returning to Cnrls
1 had for consumption by stockmen,
.thus saving the freight two ways.
I At the central plant there will be
put in an alfalfa null, which will like
ly be moved here from another valley
town. This will make alfalfa meal and
stock foods.
. If the acreage Justifies a small flour
I mill is contemplated in the pluns and
will mako a Carlsbad flour, which is
expected to equal in quality any of tha
northern flours. This will have an
advantage also, on account of freight
rates for local valley consumption.
At tho time of going to press, Mr.
Etter , who has the matter in chargo
did not care to divulge the names of
the parties, but stated that the wholes
mutter had progressed to a point
where it would likely be ennsumated
as a reality beforo Si.tunlay night of
this week and that If so, machinery
would be on the road before the end
of thirty days.

Carlabad, N. M. June, 19. "Your
country has made marked progress)
since my lut visit," says ('. J. Iilan
rhard, statistican of the Reclamation

spent three days in CurNlmd ond tha

sed. This work is !cing ilonvin co-operation
with tho local water uners, tha
commercial club and Hie Santa Fe rail
mad and is along lines allowing in
advertising government irrigation pro
jects of lute years.
"The scenes wo obtained on tha
Cafl.sbnd protect were unusually at
traction. We caught several lira
stock features with our camera that
cannot be madily duplicated in other
ssH-tions. The first day we filmed
c. herd of over two thnusr.nd high
gmde yearlings as they came to the
Avalnn pens for shipment. An IHO..
000 herd of thus class of cut tie made
a wonderfully attractive picture as
we found them on the shore- of Avu

joining hills.
Out on r. It. Trr-cy s farm In La .
Huerta we filmed a splendid herd of
registered short horn rattle which
made one of thhe flnewt pictures I ever
saw. On a farm below CarUbad wara
1200 aheep on alfalfa pasxnre. On
nnotiher place was a barn full of
dairy cuttle. In fact the number and
high grade of live stock now on the
farms of your project surprised ma
greatly, as on my last visit I found
a surprising alwence of stock of any
kind.
"You grow excellent alfalfa and
superb fruit in this valley as the na
tural conditions are superior. But
i;fter ull, real farm prosperity come
through growing of meat and bread
meut and dairy animal thrives in the
Pocos valley and the resil money

that walk to market.
"You have an excellent project here
with plenty of waUr, good irrigation
syxtem, good climate r nd a direct
line to the great markets over the
