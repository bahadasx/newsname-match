LOVEJOY MAY BE
TARGET FOR MEXICANS
Pullman .Man Desponds to Call for
Mobilization of National Guard
Troops and Will Lead Third
Battalion as Major
Closing his business affairs on a
few hours notice to respond to the
call of his country, Major George R.
Lovejoy left Monday for American
Lake. Washington, near Seattle, to
take charge of the Third Battalion of i
infantry of the Washington National
Guards, which is being mobilized I
there in response- to the orders issued ;
late Sunday night to the governor of
every state in the Union. Major
Lovejoy came to Pullman from Spo
kane about a year ago, entering in
to a law partnership with Frank E.
Sanger. The orders to report, for
duty at once came as somewhat of a
surprise, but the Pullman man j
showed a distinct eagerness for the
fray and was out of Pullman on the
first train.
The orders for a general mobiliza
tion of the National Guard of the
United State's, 100,000 strong, came
as a result of Carran/.a's demand for
tne withdrawal from Mexican soil of
the- United states troops who are
chasing Villa and his gang. Presi
dent Wilson shows no inclination to
heed the demands of the de facto
government until border brigandage
ceases, and the national guard will
be rushed to the border in anticipa
tion of serious consequences. Wash
ington's contribution to the big
army of national guards will be one
regiment of infantry, one troop of
cavalry and one company of signal
corps.
KLKMGARDS SURPRISED
About 100 friends and neighbors
gathered last Sunday at the rural
home of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Klemgard.
10 miles west of Pullman, to hid the
members of the family welcome
home alter four years spent in Cali
fornia. A sumptuous dinner was
served on the lawn and the day was
very pleasantly spent visiting. In
the evening the Klemgard orchestra
entertained the visitors with music
The affair was a complete surprise to
the Klemgard family and was one of
the most pleasant gatherings ever
held in the Ewartsville district. An
index to the general prosperity of
the Ewartsville farmers was observed
In the large number of automobiles
owned by farmers parked on the
Klemgard green. At one time 14 au
tomobiles were counted, while one
lone buggy and a single saddle horse
were made conspicuous by their
lonesomeness in the array of modern
vehicles of transportation.

BAIN A ION TO CHOPS
The copious rainfall of the early
week was a big boon to growing
crops and farmers are more optimis
tic concerning crop prospects than at
any time since the early spring. The
10 days of extremely hoi weather,
following the unusually late spring,
was ripening the fall grain prema
turely, and the rainfall will assist
materially in filling out the heads
and giving a better stand of grain.
Everything considered, the crop will
be a fair one, although not up to the
standard of the past few years. The
acreage is much less than last year.
each town club in the county, mem
bership will be governed on a basis
of population, one delegate for each
500 or less of population, and an
additional member for each addi
tional 1000. This arrangement gives
Colfax and Pullman three delegates
each, Palouse and Tekoa two each,
and all the other towns in the county
one each. These delegates will be
elected by the commercial clubs of
each town, or, in the- event that no
such organization exists. will he
named by civic authorities.
The plan of organization and
membership is an eminently fair one
to all towns concerned, and no com
munity can complain of an unfair
advantage by any other. Under the
old system the town at which the
meeting was held could turn out a
big attendance and vote through any
measure it saw fit, with the visiting
delegations hopelessly in the minor- !
ity. The new arrangement does away
with this evil, places the organiza
tion on a business like basis and aug
urs well for united action in future
on the part of the different commun
i ities of Whitman county. 7

NUMBER 36
WILL NOT WAIVE
TELEPHONE TAX
City Council Vote* No on Proposed
Ordinance Granting Belief From
Franchise Tax
Only two councilmen voiced their
approval of the proposed city ordi
nance which would relieve the Pa
cific Slates Telephone & Telegraph
company from payment of the $300
annual telephone franchise tax when
the measure came before the council
for final action Tuesday evening,
five ..I the members voting no on
the motion to adopt the ordinance
and sending it to the grave to rest
peacefully alongside of numerous
other measures which have failed to
receive the support of the city
fathers.
At the time of the purchase of the
Hell local business by the inland Co
operative company less than a year
ago. the Council we lit emphatically
on record as opposed to relinquish
ing the telephone tax Income, re
gardless of any business deals be
tween the two companies. The Bell
company was operating under a
franchise which had several years
yet to run. and which .ailed for the
payment of a stilted sum annual.)
lor franchise privileges, this sum,
during the last five years of the life
of the franchise, being $300, The
Inland company was and is still op
erating under a free franchise. Sev
eral months later the Hell company,
which still maintains a long distance
switchboard, sent representatives he
fore the council with a second re
quest for relief from the tax, which
they claimed was unjust for a long
distance business only. As a result
of this second request the ordinance
which was relegated to the grave
yard Tuesday evening was conceived
After listening patiently to three
tedious readings of the document
on as many meeting nights, the
fathers again went on record as op
posed to letting the golden shekels
slip through their fingers. Council
.men Swain, Burnett, Hammond, Nye
and Scott voted against the proposed
ordinance, while Councilmen Krue
gel and Duthie supported the meas
ure.
Just what action will he taken by
the company now is hard to say, al
though it. is expected that they will
heed the demands of the city admin
istration and make the annual pay
ments, which will net the city $1700
before the expiration of the fran
chise. Threats of removing the long
distance switchboard to outside the
city limits or isolating Pullman en
tirely from the outside world so far
as telephonic communication is con
cerned, are alleged to have been
made, but are not taken seriously.
Alios MUST HAVE
LICENSES ATTACHED
Officials of the city came in for
a considerable amount of criticism
Tuesday evening when City Attorney
Jamar objected to the granting of
permits to automobile owners who
have applied for license numbers to
operate their cars without the license
number until the required sheet iron
numerals arrive. The city attorney
branded the action as directly con
trary to law.
CHEAPER WATER TABOO
Pullman citizens who had visions
of beautiful lawns when the city of
ficials reduced the water rates dur
ing the coming hot months, were dis
appointed Tuesday evening when the
water committee reported adversely
mi amending the water ordinance to
permit of reduced rates for irriga
tion purposes during June. July and
August.
WADE STORY INJURE.*
Wade Story met with a painful ac
cident Sunday while attempting to
break a colt to the saddle. The ani
mal lunged, slipped and fell, the
young man's right foot being caught
underneath. One bone was broken
and the foot was severely mashed.
He was brought to Pullman by Dr.
Kim/.ev and taken at once to Spo
kane, where the complicated frac
ture was reduced by Dr. Eikenbary.
a specialist in that line, Tuesday.
He is reported to be getting along
nicely.
