WASHINGTON, D. C, June 23.—The state de
partment officially indicated this afternoon that a vir-
tual ultimatum has been sent to President Carranza,
of the Mexican de facto government.
If it is shown by later reports that Carranza troops
were responsible for the Carrizal battle, the state de
partment has informed Carranza he can settle the
matter by denouncing their action.
The inference is that if Oirranza does not thus
denounce the act of his soldiers, the United States
will take punitive measures.
U. S. Investigates Report That

W ASHINGTON, June 2 V—The navy department

I always proved unfounded."

The few who escaped are reported to be wandering

It was said that Gen. Pershing had sent a strong
column to rescue the scattered fragments of the force
nearly slaughtered at Carrizal. The relief column was
reported racing along the dry bed of ihe Rio Carmen
toward Carrizal.
These advices are contradicted by official Mexican
reports.

TO HANDLE (J. S.
AFFAIRS IN WAR
W AS! I INC,TON', Tune
The United States
government Itas asked

American interests thru
licr diplomats in Mexico
in tlie event of war, it was
learned today.
Tills request was explained as
not being indicative of immediate
trouble, but rather as a precaution.
should war transpire. Such moves
are customary when trouble brews
between two governments.
(ireat Itritaln was selected be
cause she has extensive interests
in .Mexico and her consequent abil
ity to look after whatever might
arise in the event of war.
When trouble previously result
ed In the Vera Cruz Incident and
the IT.l T . S. was without an ambas
sador at Mexico City, the Brazilian
ambassador took charge of Ameri
ca's affairs.
<!en. Pershing's report on the
Carrizal battle, decoded early today,
contained the story of Tenth caval
r> stragglers, putting responsibility
on the Mexicans.
War department activity centers
in getting 111 ilitll ready for border
service.
Ten thousand men will leave as
soon as they can l>e prepared.
The administration position up
to today tends to class the Carrizal
incident with the now forgotten
Parral clash and the more recent
unprovoked attack on American
sailors at Mazatlan.
The source of real trouble In the
Carrizal affair remaining is tho fact
that American prisoners are still
held in Mexican custody.
The government unquestionably
will make demands upon Carranza
for the release of the American pris
oners, (t was stated today.
