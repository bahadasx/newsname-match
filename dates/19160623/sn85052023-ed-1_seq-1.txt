BATTLE WITH
THE GREASERS
Is Fought by American Troops In
Mexico Wednesaay, but Details
Are Yet Unknown.
Latest From Mexico.
Stragglers who reached the head
quarters of Gen. Pershing last night
reported that the attack, made upon
the Americans by Mexicans under
Gen. Gomez at Carrizal, was entirely
unprovoked. Gen. Pershing, while
awaiting official information from
the Eleventh Cavalry command, sent
to the relief of the Tenth, forwarded
this information to Gen. Funston.
The report of stragglers was that the
Mexican machine gunfire was begun
after a conference between the com
manding American officer and Gen.
Gomez without any previaus warn
ing. .
In a statement give out last night
by Gen. Trevino, in connection with
the story of the attack as related by
one of the American prisoners, he
stated that he would still follow his
original orders and attack any force
of Americans that advanced in any
except a northernly direction. Ac
cording to the American prisoners
received in Chihuahua City the
United States troops lost their offi
cers, two of them being killed and
the other wounded in the course of
the engagement.
All along the border, with one or
two exceptions, the Mexicans are
moving their troops, supplies and
civilians back into the interior. At
Juarez the evacuation is said to have
been pactically completed.
Washington officials last night,
pending the receipt of an official re
port from the American commander,
were inclined to regard the Carrizal
encounter as a detached incident and
not necessarily one signifying or
leading to hostilities.
Fort Thomas was selected as the
mobilization point for the Kentucky
militia last night by Secretary Baker
after a conference at the War De
partment, and an order was sent to
the state authorities instructing them
to take their forces to the concentra
tion camp at the earliest possible mo
ment. The Central and Western
Army Department heads were noti
fied last night to send 5,000 militw -men
to the border as soon as they
.could be got in readiness.
El Paso, Texas, June 23. Ameri
can, and Carranza troops fought a
bloo'dy battle Wednesday only a few
hours after President Wilson's 6,000
word rebuke Tuesday to General
Carranza had gone forward to Mox
ico City.
The Americans lost twelve dead,
including their commander, and sev
enteen prisoners, while fourteen Car
ranza soldiers were killed and thirty
wounded in the battle of Carrizal
Wednesday, according to the official
announcemnt today of the Mexican
consulate. The consulate announced
that complete details had been re
ceived from Villa Ahumada. The
Americans removed their wounded
with them. The name of the Amer
ican commander is still unknown.
The bodies of the American dead
were counted as they lay on the
field of battle.
The engagement took place on the
Santo Domingo ranch near the Mex
ican town of Carrizal, which is nine
miles southwest of Villa Ahumada,
the Mexican field headquarters in
Northern Chihuahua.
The Americans engaged are
thought to have been members of a
troop from the Tenth Cavalry, a ne
gro regiment, returning from a scout
ing trip to Guzman. The size of the
Mexican force, whose commander,
General Felix Gomez, was killed, is
not known yet.
News of the battle was received
in Juarez by General Francisco Gon
zales, Carranza commander of the
military zone of the border. For
some reason General Gonzales kept
the storv secret until late in the af
ternoon, "when an American, J. C.
Huppel, returning to the border from
the interior, brought to El Paso the
news that he had seen numbers of
Mexican dead along the Mexican
Central Railroad tracks at Villa Ah
umada, and had been told there had
been an encounter.
General Gonzale's first step after
confirming the news was to issue a
statement placing the blame on the
American commander. He charged
that the American troops fired first
on the Mexicans, but that their shots
were directed at a courier who had
just presented to them a request that
they retire. ,
American army officers declared
absolute disbelief tonight in General
Gonzales assertions. The opinion
was expressed that if the Americans
fired on the Mexicans they did so be
cause it was necessary in order to
insure their own safety.
A new version of the Carrizal en
gagement was brought to El Paso
Thursday by a Mexican civilian, who
was in Villa Ahumada early Wednes
day afternoon and said he assisted
in dressing some of the Mexican
wounded.
He said that General Felix Gomez
the slain Carranza commander, had
been aware of the approach of the
Americans for twelve hours and had
sent a number of couriers to them
warning them to return to their en
campment. When they persisted in their ad
vance, he said, a pitfall several hun
dred feet in length was dug directly
in the trail over which the cavalry
men must ride. This Vas cleverly
concealed with brush.
As the Americans rode unsuspect
ingly thru the sand dunes toward the
entrenchment, General Gomez lay
concealed some hundred yards away
in the mesquite.
The horses of the American van-
f guard plunged into the pitfall, un
seating their riders and injuring a
number of them.
Then, the Mexican asserted, the
Carranza forces lying in ambush
raked the American ranks with a ma
chine gun.
The heavy fire forced the Ameri
cans to withdraw to reorganize their
lines and, the Mexicans captured Sev
enteen soldiers, who had been
thrown into the pit.
He asserted that it was then that
General Gomez went forward under
a flag of truce and that before the
proposed parley had begun an irre
sponsible soldier again started 'the
gun fire.
A small" detachment of cavalrymen
charged toward General Gomez and
his party, who -were in the center
of their field directly between the
two commands, their pistol fire kill
ing the Mexican leader.
According to the story, both com
mands withdrew. The Mexican was
unable to estimate the Mexican dead
but asserted that the American dead
numbered forty.
Military authorities here expressed
no doubt that both commands suffer
ed heavily in the fight, but pointed
out that no information concerning
the engagement other than from
Mexican sources has been received.
CHANCE TO JOIN ARMY.
Corporal Featherstone, of the U.
S. army, is in Stanford to enlist re
cruits for Uncle Sam's regular army
and will be here till June 28th. This
is the opportunity for all who desire
to see service in Mexico to get into
the game, for those who join the
regular army will probably see ser
vice in the war zone at once, whereas
the state militiamen will only be used
on the border.
MULES WILL GO SKY HIGH
In the Event Uncle Sam Gets Into a
Real War With Mexico.
"If war comes on with v Mexico,
mules are going sky high," thus said
Bowen G. Fox, the big mule buyer
of Danville, to an I. J. representative
Wednesday, and Mr. Fox knows.
Mr. Fox will begin buying for
Kindig, of Pennsylvania and also for
Wright, of Columbia, Tenn., about
the middle of July. He has already
contracted to buy extensively for
them. Both are said to have con
tracts to furnish mules to warring
nations in Europe, and now the
United States is going to get ac
tively into the market for mules.
Mr. Fox says that he will buy prin
cipally unbroken, two-year-old mules
for Kindig, but for war purposes,
broken and more aged animals will
be actively in demand. Quite a num,
ber of Lincoln county mule men
have stocked up heavily, foreseeing
last year just such a condition as
seems to have developed in the mule
market.
High class mule colts are already
selling at top figures. The record
price in this part of the state seems
to have been $125, and they are not
going for any higher figure any
where else so far as the I. J. can
learn. The Mt. Olivet Tribune
Democrat told of the following good
mule colt sales last week in Robert
son county: "During the past week
E. L. Tilton has bought a number of
suckling mules, sired by Hester and
Perry's jack, Spanish King, for
which he paid fancy prices. He
bought one of Wm. Hendeson, pay
ing $110; one of Henry Askins, pay
ing $100; one of Mrs. Emma Hemin
ger paying $100; one of Charles
Henson, paying $105; one of Mau
rice Denahey, paying $125."
LITTLEJOHN COMING BACK.
Those who saw and enjoyed the
Littlejohn Carnival Shows here last
year will be glad to know that they
viL have thj oppoitunity of seeing
them again soon. ?Ii. Littlejohn had
intended showing here this week, but
not wanting to conflict with the
Chautauqua postponed his coming
until Monday week, July 3rd, when
he will again play Stanford under
the auspices of the Independent Or
der of Odd Fellows of this city for
an entire week. His show last year
was good and clean, and having add
ed new featues, it may be expected
to be better than ever. The next
issue of the I. J. will give full partic
ulars of the big carnival's coming.

CHAUTAUQUA A
GREAT SUCCESS
Big Audiences Are Being Delighted
and Splendid Entertainment Is
Winner in Every Way.
Stanford's1 Chautauqua is a mag
nificent success in every way.
'With two day's programs having
been completed up to the hour the
I.J. went to press today the Woman's
Club has been able to meet every
expense, pay every bill, liquidate the
entire cost of the Chautauqua and
will have money in the treasury when
everything is said and done.
.But equally as much as the finan
cial success of the venture is the suc
cess of the program which is being
offered as delightful entertainments
in every way. The two attractions
so far given have been splendid in
every way. The service of the Alka
hest Bureau could hardly be improv
ed upon. Co-operating with the
Stanford Woman's Club, which nev
er does anything by halves, the Chau
tauqua patrons have been cared for
and entertained in a manner which
leaves little more to be desired.
The large tent on the lot back of
the college building is comfortable,
and commodious. Pretty young la
dy ushers have been provided who
see that everyone secures a good
seat.
Dr. W. J. Mahoney, the platform
manager, starts off each program,
with zest. He knows his business
well.
The opening afternoon perform
ance on Wednesday was well attend
ed, mostly by season ticket holders,
which is proving the case for the
afternoons, the big audiences coming
at night.
A crowd which filled every seat in
the large and commodious tent was
present for the first evening per
formance of the Chautauqua. The
first number was a very strong one.
The attraction was the Lyceum La
dies' Orchestra, and the immense
audience, was delighted with the eve
ning's entertainment. A good crowd
had heard the ladies perform in the
afternoon but their real program was
in the evening. All of the members
of this orchestra are real artists and
every number was encored several
times. The program rendered was
as follows:
"Call of America" Mohden.
Overture, "Zampa," Herold Or
chestra. Cornet Solo, "Jupiter Polka" Gold
man Miss Keller.
Selection, "Down South" Myddle
ton Orchestra.
Violin Solo, "Hungarian Dance"
- Violin solo, "Hungarian Dance"
Miss Eiler.
Baritone Solo "Toreador" Mr.
Barbour.
"Egyptian Ballet," Luigini Or-
Reading, "Cornstalk Fiddle"
MisS Larcher.
Cello Solo, "Barcarole" Miss
Beebe.
Baritone Solo, (a) "Exhortation,"
Cook; (b) "Bow Leg Boy," Bergen
Mr. Barbour.
American Patrol Orchestra.
Packard, the cartoonist and all
round artist was the attraction
Thursday and to say he both pleased
and delighted the big audiences
which greeted him is expressing it
mildly. He is a star of the first mag
nitude. He kept his audience con
vulsed with laughter or serious with
the pathos of his remarks, at his
pleasure. Scores declared after the
close of Thusday evening's perform
ance that they have already secured
more than the worth of their whole
season's ticket. And there are oth
er good things yet to come.
The Hampton Cout Singers are
here this afternoon, followed by a
lecture by Dr. Mahoney. In the eve
ning the Hampton Court Singers give
their big program.
Saturday afternoon Dr. Mahoney
lectures, and Saturday night one of
the star features of the Alkahest
program will be given. It will be
the lecture by Judge George D. Al
den, of Massachusetts on "The Needs
of the Hour."
Sunday afternoon there will be a
Chautauqua mass meeting and union
services followed by an address by
Judge Alden. There is no charge to
the Sunday afternoon number.
Monday afternoon the Royal
Welsh Male Quartette gives 30 min
utes of music and Dr. Mahoney talks
and that night the Royal Welsh Male
quartette gives its grand concert.
The Chautauqua concludes Tues
day with a short concert by the Bea
sey Sisters Concert Company in the
afternoon and their grand concert
that night, with Miss Eileen Beatty
as soprano soloist.
GARRARD BOY HURT.
Paul Stapp, the fourteen-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. Forrest Stapp,
of Garrard, was the victim of a seri
ous accident at his home in the Lan
caster suburbs, the youth being up
on the topmost branch in a high
cherry tree, and in some way losing
his footing he fell a distance of some
forty feet. He sustained a fracture
of the shoulder blade and required
the attendance of two physicians.

BOOTLEGGERS
HARD HIT AGAIN
Two Moreland Negroes, to Whom
Chas.'Reid Had Whisky Shipped,
Catch Heavy Fines.
Two more Moreland bootleggers
caught stiff fines in court here Thurs
day, when Judge J. P. Bailey slapped
$100 and' 10 days in jail on Felix
Anderson and $50 and 10 days on
George McGormack. Both are col
ored. The testimony showed that
Charley Reid, who is now hiding out
to avoid payment of a $3,000 fine,
had bought liquor from a wholesale
house and had it shipped to More
land to these two negroes. Bills
were found, from the whisky houses,
showing the amounts of the ship
ments and the names of those to
whom Reid had the bopze sent in.
Anderson was shown td have obtain
ed 20 gallons of whisky since Jan
uary 22, 1916. Reio; McCormack
and Walter McCormack were acquit
ted on similar charges.
Deputy Sheriff W. S. Drye Thurs
day also arrested Jonas Ingram, a
white man of that section, and who
is father-in-Jaw of- Charley Reid.
Three indictments fpr selling whisky
have been returned? against Ingram
by the grand jury, j
Friday morning Frank and Brack
Reid, brothers of 1 Charley, were
brought to jail here having been ar
rested upon evidence of the Law and
Order League of the West End,
which has determined to break up
boot-legging in tha?section if it can
be done. They are caarged with hav
ing liquor in their possession for pur
poses of sale. John iAlcorn, a negro,
charged with having tried to whip a
negro woman, was also arrested and
brought to jail. 'The trial of the
two Reid boys will probably be held
Monday. s

MISS NUNNELLEY
WINS MEDAL
At Moreland W. C. T. U. Contest
District Convention Meets
There Two Days.
The W. C. T. U. Convention held
at Moreland the 15th and 16th was
one of the best ever held in this dis
trict. The gold medal contest held
on the evening of the 15th was well
attended and a great deal of interest
manifested. Miss Cora Nunnelley
won the medal. The two sessions of
the convention held on the 16th were
well attended and full of enthusiasm.
Delegates were there from Danville,
Stanford, Hustonville, McKinney,
Liberty and Moreland Unions.
Mrs. Frances E. Beauchamp, the
state president, conducted the insti
tute hour which was helpful to all
present. Some splendid talks and pa
pers were given, also reports from
different unions, showing much good
work done in past year. Moreland
was untiring in extending her hospi
tality. An excellent noon lunch was
served. The convention was closed
with Mrs. Beauchamp's magnificent
address, which many said was the
best she was ever heard to give.
The resolutions adopted at the con
vention were as follows:
With gratitude to our -Heavenly
Father for this convention, We, the
Woman's Christian Temperance Un
ion of Division B., of the Eighth Dis
trict of Kentucky in Convention as
sembled at Moreland, June 16th,
1916, do hereby declare:
First That we are organized for
the prohibition of the liquor traffic,
and do re-affirm our stand for total
abstainence for the individual, and
for State and National Prohibition.
Second That whereas scientists
have proven that tobacco is harmful
especially to the growing youth, we
do heeby oppose the use of it, and
declare for even greater activity in
education against it, especially the
cigarette.
Third Thai we do rejoice in the
recent efforts made in this county
for the enforcement of the prohibi
tion laws and do hereby ask that the
county officers do all in their power
to convict the transgressors of the
law.

is the great enemy of the home, and
state, and we believe that prohibi
tion and woman's suffrage go hand
in hand we do declare our belief in
equal suffrage for woman with man,
that by united efforts the home and
public conditions may be improved.
Fifth That we have a copy of
these resolutions published in the

BUILDING A GREAT ROADWAY
State Inspector Comes Here to Look
at Work on C. O. Pike.
"Uncle John" White, of Richmond,
former representative from Madison
county in the legislature, was here
Monday afternoon, to inspect the
state-aid road which is being built
on the crab Orchard pike. "Uncle
John" has been appointed an inspec
tor by the State Road Department,
and he found 'one of the very best
roads being built anywhere under
state supervision right here. County
Engineer McKeeRiffe, who has super
vision of the work for the county,
is seeing to it that the county is get
ting the full worth of its money in
every way, while the Woodard Con
struction firm knows how to build a
road and is building one that will be
a credit and convenience for a long
time to come.
The grading of the road from Crab
Orchard to the Rockcastle county
line which is being done under con
tract by Gus Gieszl and his force of
men is being pushed rapidly and in
good shape. Mr. Gieszl had an enor
mous task before him but he has
handled it well and has the road
about in shape for metal. He cut
down the well known slate hill to
about a 7 per cent grade, which was
a big job in itself. Arrangements
are now being made to build the 40
foot span bridge over the creek. The
bridge will be of concrete, and will
be a fixture as long as there is a
road.
BUYS INSURANCE AGENCY.
D. A. Thomas has sold his Conti
nental Fire Insurance Farm Agency
for Lincoln county to J. M. McCar
ty, brother of W. L. McCarty, and
the new proprietor has taken active
charge of his new work. Mr. Thomas
purchased this agency from the
Bromleys some time ago, and has
done some fine work with it while
here. He has not made definite
plans yet but will probably not make
Stanford his home after winding up
his business affairs, which will be
bad news to his host of friends here.
Mr. McCarty has many friends and
acquaintances all over the county
and will in every way endeavor to
give them prompt and efficient ser
vice and continue to merit a share
of their business, which we will ap
preciate, tie will continue the of
fice, with Hughes & McCarty, real
estate, on Lancaster street opposite
the court house.
YOUNGSTER DRANK BOOZE
Henry, the little son of Seymore
Brownfield, of Mercer county, was
saved from death by heroic efforts
after he had drank a large quantity
of whisky this week. The little fel
low, with his father, had gone to vis
it William Pulliam, a neighbor, and
while playing around the house got
hold of a bottle of whisky. Before
he was detected he drank a quantity
out of a quart bottle, something
over a half pint it is thought. He
was taken violently ill and lost con
sciousness. He was hurried to town
where Dr. Price administered restor
atives. After working with the boy
for several hours he showed no sign
of recovering consciousness and his
life was despaired of. However, late
Sunday -night he revived and is now
on the high road to recovery. The
boy was unconscious nearly twelve,
hours.
HEMP BREAKING REVOLUTION
Warren P. Elkin, of Winchester,
who recently invented a power hemp
breaking machine, has tried it out
and finds that it does the work per
fectly and economically. The ma
chine has a capacity of four thousand
pounds per day of ten hours. The
hemp does not have to be rotted so
long or so ma".h and there will be a
great saving in weight and quality
over the old method of breaking and
the new machine does not make any
thing like as much tow as the hand
break. When the hemp is sufficient
ly rotted the hemp can be assembled
in the field or better in a barn, if
it is convenient, and the hemp can
be broken out in any kind of weath
er. It is constructed on a truck and
can be hauled from shock to shock in
the field if desired. The machine is
being covered by patent for protect
ion. CAUGHT 'EM IN THE ACT.
Railroad Policeman, J. Egbert
Wallin, of Brodhead, tells the I. J.,
that at the gathering of excursion
ists at High Bridge Sunday he ar
rested eight young men who were in
duling in a game of craps. He land
ed them all and took them to Nich
olasville where they were fined $50
each. Four youngsters were arrest
ed for drunkenness and they caught
it to the tune of $14 each. Capt.
Wallin is one of the most efficient

ROCKCASTLE
ROAD BOOSTERS
Visit Stanford and Spend a Seaso
of Conference and Good Fellow
ship With Local Men.
An enthusiastic bunch of good
road boosters came down from Rock
castle county Thursday afternoon
and spent an hour here. The object
of their trip was to get an insight of
the work of reconstruction of the
turnpikes of this and Garrard county
and ideas for road-making that is
proposed and being carried on in
their home county. Some of the
gentlemen had come over the road
from Mt. Vernon to Brodhead, where
they were joined by a number of the
best citizens of that thriving little
city, thence to Crab Orchard, via
Lancaster and then to Stanford.
Their itinerary hacv extended over
the almost impassable mountain road
and probably some of the best pike
in the State and when they got here
they were ready to do almost any
thing for the promotion of road im
provement. Tho, contrast between
the bad and the good had made them
more determined than ever that
Rockcastle county should have bet
ter highways and thus not only make
traveling much better but open to
the world a way to the wonderful
natural resources of the county.
Stanford people had expected the
gentlemen an hour and a half earlier
and had they arrived at the appoint
ed time an interesting program
would have been carried out. As it
was there were probably only 25 or
30 people to welcome the neighbors
to the best little city on the map.
Gathering in the county court room,
Mr. J. C. McClary, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, welcomed
the gentlemen in true Kentucky
fashion. Born in Rockcastle, he felt
an interest in what was being done
there and he warmly congratulated
the visitors on their work for better
roads.
County Attorney E. R. Gentry, for
the visitors, responded in a happy,
but brief talk. He told of the work
being done, of some of the obstacles
encountered, but sad that his people
were determined to lift Rockcastle
from the mud and mire and knowing
that good roads would do it, they
would never let up until the end
had been accomplished.
Dr. O'Bannon made a few appro
priate remarks, as did Rev. A. J.
Pike and A. E. Albright, the two lat
ter gentlemen being among the vis
itors. Mr. Albright said that he and
his friends had looked forward to
their stay here and were disappoint
ed that it would have to be cut short
by an accident or two to their autos
while coming over the bad roads to
the Rockcastle line. He hoped that
ere many months had waxed and
waned the trip to Lincoln would be
a delightful ride over good roads; it
would get Rockcastle and Lincoln
people closer together and the
friendlier they became the better it
would suit him. He thanked the
Stanford people for their courtesies
and invited them all to run up and
make a return visit just as soon as
possible.
Judge James P. Bailey did not
make a talk but did all in his power
to entertain the visitors. Sheriff
Weatherford and County Clerk Coop
er, Secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce J. Howenstine were also
most courteous to them.
The following gentlemen compos
ed the crowd: Magistrates W. M.
Hunt, Louis McGuire, J. L. Arnold,
and Sherman Chasteen, County
Judge Matt Ballard, County Clerk
Felix S. Bowman, County Attorney
E. R. Gentry, W. H. Sowder, John
Robins, A. E. Albright, Rev. A. J.
Pike, Prof. J. L. Pilkenton. Rev. A.
B. Porter, A. M. Hiatt, R. H. Hamm,
Logan Bryant, D. B. Albright. J. G.
Frith, Nelson Griffin, C. A. Wheel
don, Walter Roberts, E. C. Watson.
Joe, John and Charles Riddle. The
Crab Orchard gentlemen who accom
panied them were: J. Thomas Cher
ry, Morris M. Perkins, George B.
Lyne and Morris Adams.
Work of grading the road from
Mt. Vernon to the Lincoln line via
Brodhead was begun Monday morn
ing and it will be pushed to comple
tion. Seven miles of the road from
Mt. Vernon toward the Madison line
are being built, a good deal of the
work having already been finished.
It is the purpose of the county to
build at least 25 miles of good road
with the $100,000 obtained from the
bond issue and the two years of
State Aid Rockcastle will get.
It will be remembered that a con
tract to build the pike from Livings
ton to Brodhead was let some
months ago, but the contractors gave
up the job before they begun it, pre
ferring to pay the $1,000 forfeit to
carrying out the task. This caused
some delay in road improvement but
the Rockcastle people say this does
not lessen their enthusiasm and that
better roads all over the county is
the end desired and they propose to
reach that end.
Robert J. Scott has been appoint
ed postmaster at Wilmore, ending a
hard fight for the office among sev
eral applicants.
