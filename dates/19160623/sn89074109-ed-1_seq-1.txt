School Census

C. I. Crone, recently appointed
to complete the school census of
the Beach school district, has
tompleted his report and the can
vass makes a creditable showing.
A total of 608 of school age,
amenable to the Beach district,
is the showing of the census.
An important finding of more
than casual interest is that near
ly one hundred more children
will be of the prescribed age, six
years, to take up school duties
during the coming year, an ex
cellent commentary upon the
growth and development of Beach
from the standpoint of increase in
population. The rapid increase
of pupils from year to year again
threatens to exceed the accomoda
tions offered by the present
school building.
The census is taken each year
for the purpose of determining
the amount due the district as a
slate -appropriation, which ap
proximates $10.00 for each pu
pil.
Peie Palmer and wife made an
-{automobile trip to Belfield Sun
day to witness the game. On
their return, Pete stated that he
noticed two cars which apparent
ly had mixed it while rambling
through a narrow stretch of road
in the badlands. One car was
minus a front wheel, while the
other h!ad a rear wheel clipped
off. It developed later that the
Ford belonged to Leo Matchette,
and that the Wheel was lost in
coasting down a steep incline. R.
C. Fuller towted the car from the
fene of the accident to Sentinel
Butte on his return from the Bel
field game Sunday.

COVER EMERGENCIES
IN POSSIBLE STRIKE
A telegram to the Chronicle
from Division Superintendent T.
H. Lantry at Glendive states that
Warren S. Stone, Grand Chief of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, is on his w-ay west to
obtain information covering plans
of railroads for meeting femer
gencies that will occur if strike is
declared.
Before leaving New York, Mr.
S'^one made the statement that
there are not enough avail-able
men who possess even a slight
knowledge to permit roads to op
erate with strike breakers, and
that he is certain of winning wage
increases.
The conference held in New
York City between the railroad
men demanding shorter hours
and increased pay in certain in
stances, and railway managers,
which ended a week ago, resulted
in a deadlock. The railroads feel
that they have made all the con
cessions legitimately to be ex
pected of them under present tar
iff schedules, without facing an
enormous operating deficit. The
effect of a general strike through

business men, who see a prospect

J. D. HALSTEAD
Candidate on the Republican
Ticket For the Office of Sheriff
of Golden Valley County.
Mr. Halstead came to the
^Golden Valley in the early
days of its settlement, and
was one of the first to ac
quire a homestead here.
Mr. Halstead has been act
ively interested in farmers'
co-operative movements. He
has been idei'tnied with the
local farmers' elevator com
pany going on ten years—
first as one of its organizers,
next as a director, and at the
recent annual meeting he was
by the stockholders elected
president of the company by
acclamation.
Mr. Halstead is essentially
a farmers' candidate. If
nominated and elected, he
will devote his entire time
and attention to the duties of
the sheriff's office. He feels
that qualification should be
the sole and only test, and
that he is eminently quali
fied, and that he will admin
ister the duties of this office
"apably and impartially, if el
ected, is too well known to
his many friends to require
repetition
This being an agricultural
community, Mr. Halstead
feels that this important of
fice should be filled by a
farmer, and, if the farmers
who know him best have
their way, there will be no
question but that he will be
the next sheriff.
Regarding State
and U.S. Senator
George F. Hunt and Porter J. Mc
Cumber, Respectively, the Log
ical Candidates.—"Knight"
L. B. Hanna is Queered
W5th the People.
With the nearing approach of
the primaries, the voter is con
fionted with two clearly defined
issues—whether state dominancy
is to remain in the hands of Big
Business with a repetition of the
notorious "business /administra
tion" of Knight L. B. Hanna,
prince of the North Dakotans, to
whom we have bowed the neck
of servitude, or whether the rev
enue producing, majority tax
paying agricultre interests of the
slate are to have something to say
by the election of Lynn Frazier,
the only candidate in a field of
six who has sworn unequivocal
allegiance to the farmers of the
stale against the workings of the
Iianna and McKenzie machines.
The attacks on Frazier are the
mendacious attacks of a politic
al machine which exerts its last
ounce of energy in protest against
a crumbling dictatorship, under
which the people of the state
have writhed and squirmed in
vain. Like the old man of the
sea, it has affixed itself to our
backs. Only the concerted ief
fort of the people of the state can
pry the parasite loose—and the
glorious opportunity for doing it
presents itself at the polls next
Wednesday, nol to appear again
for two long years—perhaps nev
er. W:lh 'the present strj-j^ih
of the farmers' movement be
hind him, Lynn Frazier can se
cure the republican nomination.
The farmers of this county and
the state owe it to themselves and
Incir peketbooks to rally in un
swerving support to the standard
of Lynn Frazier for governor of
North Dakota.
Knight L. B. Hanna, violator of
•he state and national constitu
tions, dictator of the most per
nicious political machine the
state has ever known, is using

this vast machinery to project
himself into the United States
senate. Hanna is a banker, and
from what we hear fte-is a good
one—not that we mean most
bankers are dishonest. In the
minds of the vast majority of
the people of the state, the Me
dina bank failure has never been
satisfactorily explained, like a
good many other things, even
though he was whitewashed in
the courts. His record in con
gress—he is not very modest—
he has spread over his own sig
nature far and wide. What he
icould have done would take long
er in the telling. Some of the
things he has done are summed
up in an article on another page—
not with the greatest credit to
Mr. Hanna. The selection of
Hanna to the senate in place of
Porter |1. McCumber means a
serious setback to the agricultur
al northwest. To match his com
paratively puny mentality against
one of the strongest men in the
United States senate, a man
whose years of faithful service
to the people and devotion to the
legitimate interests of his constit
uents has commended him to the
unfailing confidence of the peo
ple of North Dakota, regardless
of party, is the superlative deg
ree of absurdity. What the state
needs to represent it in the high
est legislative chamber of the Un­
may still prove worthy of it

SHERIFF
"The records of this office are will kept and judging from the records
made of the different papers served and sales conducted I would say that
the office is very competently handled. It would appear that every pos
sible effort is being made in the collection of delinquent, personal property
taxes. I found that all fees are being paid into the county treasury as re
paired by law."
lo the voters of Golden Valley County.
As the duties of my office will not allow nie to make a houso to house
campaign as the oilier candidates are doing, I take, this means of letting
you know I am a candidate for re-election to the office of Sheriff of this
county and if you f"cl that I have fulfilled the office in an upright and
honorable manner, I will appreciate your support in the coming primary
election. I assure you all, that I have done my very best to fulfil the duties
of this offic# without fear or favor and not having heard of any complaint
feel with pride that I have given satisfaction, and for these reasons, I
can a.sk you for your support and if re-elected I will again perform the
ituties of the office as I have done heretofore. My method of collecting
delinquent taxes without causing any extra expenses on the tax payer
speaks for its self. My office and books are open for inspection at any time
and will show that I have collected taxes back as far as 1005.
In conclusion I wish to inform you that no candidate for sheriff or any
nther county office has been indorsed by the Non Partisan League. The
indorsement of the League is for state offices only.
Thanking you for your friendly feeling in the past and trusting that
I am yours very sinceriy

ited States is a man with some
measure of ability, and not a
man whose "bigness" consists of
a long pocketbook capable of
purchasing with mere money one
ot the highest offices in the gift
of the people—a travesty on the
power of suffrage which should be
resented by every man able to
vote at the polls.
The only governor in the Un
ited Stales who accepted Henry
Ford's invitation to subdue war
ring Europe was Hanna —our
own peerless Hanna. Wrhen the
bubble blew up, and the members
of the parly made a wild scram
ble for cover, Hanna came home
to explain the situation to his
constituents—after being knight
ed, presumably "prince of the
savage North Dakotans," at the
hands of a foreign king. That
he had burnt his fingers in the
affair and received a title did not
make the explaining easier. That
he was mixed up in the affair at
all was sufficient to make him
the laughing slock of the entire
country, and reflected upon the
honor of the state as well. To
protect the slate's reputation is
nol easy when a mountebank pulls
the strings. North Dakota can
not forget this incident, which its
people resent bitterly and in
tensely because of the reflection
on the state itself. Is it reason

C. I. Crone
A popular candidate for Treas
urer of Golden Valley County.
Mr. Crone became a candidate
for Ihis office on account of the
numerous demands made upon
him by farmers and business men
from all parts of the county who
had tranacted business with him
while he was Assistant Cashier in
the Golden falley State Bank.
If nominated and elected, Mr.
Crone will give the office his
lime and attention, as he will
have no other business engage
ments and he will always be
found in the 'treasurers office, the
same courteous servant of the
people, as when employed in the
bank.
No man in the county is better
qualified for County Treasurer
than Mr. Crone, as he is a com
petent bookkeeper and account
ant. He is thirty years of age
and his many years' business ex
perience especially fits him for
this office. There is no doubt but
hat he will receive a liberal sup

Below is an article taken from
the Colchester, Independent of
Colchester, Illinois.
"In a letter received by friends
in Colchester from C. I. Crone of
Reach, North Dakota, we are in
formed that he is a candidate for
treasurer on the republican ticket
in the county in which he* re*,
sides.
"Mr. Crone is an old Colchester

He was born and raised in this

"He is a young man of the best

a good mixer, and we are guess
ing that he will make a good race
for the position. We will war
rant, that could his old friends in
Colchester have the opportunity
of lending any assistance that he
