AZBILLS WANT NEW TRIAL
M0TI0NHEARD TODAY
A motion was filed in the Superior
court yesterday by the attorneys for
tho Azbill brothers, who were con
victed last week of murder in the first
degree, asking for a new trial. A
motion is also pending for suspending
judgment until the motion for a new
trial is heard. The sentence was to
have been pronounced on the two men
yesterday morning but was put off
until today to hear the motions filed.
One affidavit was filed by theat
tornoys for the defense in which one
B. L. Watson of Willinms, swears
that h overheard H. C. Sanders, a
member of tho jury who found the
.brothers guilty, say at the prelimin
ary hearing in Williams, "that both
tho Azbills wero guilty and should be
hung."
Another affidavit by Mrs. Julia Mc
Donell, mother of the convicted men,
says that in a conversation with Mr.
Wall, after the two men were found
guilty, he said: "Mr. Thomas would
gladly pay a big sum of money if
they would only bring back his son
alive, and. that they would gladly
turn both of the Azbills lose if that
could be done."
Other grounds upon which the mo
tion for a new trial is based relate to
that im-'
..... v w 1
technicalities and the claim
proper evidence was admitted
d during
hn t ft
The general impression seems to
be that it is a last effort to save the
" i
lives of the two men, without much
hope of success.

Mexican Takes French Leave
A Mexican was picked up and
brought into Flagstaff Monday by
trainmen who thought he had been hit
by the train. He was taken to the
county hospital and upon regaining
consciousness he stated that another
Mexican had struck him with a pick
handle. Later' the next day the
Afrtirlpnn flTnawArino' tlm floQrrinfinn
given by the injured man was brought
in by the officers only to find that the
battered one had said adieu to the
hospital and was nowhere to be found.
It is supposed that when the injured
Mexican found himself not dead he
could not bear to bring charges
against the one who had playfully
tapped him on the coco.

MARSHAL MURRAY SAYS
SPEEDING .MUST STOP
.j.
Town Marshal Chas. Murray
issued an edict and is posting
warnings to the effect that
speeding within the limts of the
town of Flagstaff must cease
forthwith. The ordinance of the
town in respect to fast traveling
: says that 10 miles per hour is
the limit.
It Is not the intention of our
8- genial town marshal to curtail
! the joys of motoring, but he, like
! many others, feels that serious
'i- accidents may result from fast
: driving on the town streets.
Although a ten milo clip may
seem a snail's pace to- some be-
: hind the wheel, its .better than
: jeopardizing the life and limb of
: pedestrains and wishing the
Judge a hearty "Good Morning."
Marshal Murray says the ordi-
! nance will be-, impartially en-
: forced. "'

CAN NOW SHIP PERSONAL
USE FROM KANSAS CITY
A decision has been handed
from the Federal Court of Kan-
sas City, Mo., Judge Pollock pre-
siding, that liquor shipments in-
to Arizona must be acepted by
express companies. The ship-
ments, however, may be accept-
ed only for personal use and an
nfildavit to that effect must be
filed with thc express company
before a shipment can be sec-
ured. '
i; The case was brought up by a
big brewery firm in Kansas City
aftcr the railroad and express
companies had repeatedly re-
fused to accept the shipments.
In thc instructions to local
agents the express companies
say that shipments arc to be re-
ceived temporarily only upon !
the affidavit of the consignee.
Just what the "temporary"
means is only a guess.

GREAT HOTEL NOW
' ASSURED FLAGSTAFF
That Flagstaff may have the big
$200,00 hotel that has been under
consideration for so long by many in
terested in the new hotel proposition,
seems to have about reached a point
where it will at last become a reality.
Everything now points to the success
of the big project, with many of the.
details of the proposition already
worked out.
The new .hotel will not be brought
about by a promotion scheme, but by
the legitimate efforts of thc business
men of Flagstaff many of whom have
subscribed liberally toward the build
ing. A number directly interested in the
new hotel company have decided to
incorporate what will be known as
the "Flagstaff Hotel Development
Co" to consist of from twTenty-five
to thirty of the leading business men
of the city, from which number a
board of directors and officers will bo
selected to handle the building' of the
hostelry. No action has been taken
