100,000 MORE MEN
FOR MEXICAN DUTY
THEY WILL BE MOBILIZED IMME
DIATELY FOR SERVICE ON
THE BORDER.
MORE WARSHIPS SENT OUT
At the War, Navy and State Depart
ments, It Was Stated That No New
Advices as to the Situation
in Mexico Had Corre.
Wa<shin.uton.- Virtually the entire
mobile strrng;hI of h i N: tiounal Guard
of the United State:; was ordered nmus
tered Into the federal service by
President Wilson. Abou:t 10)0,00(0 iln
are expected to respond to the era:!.
They will be mobilized immediately
for such service on tlhe Mexican bor
der as later may be, assigic~f t them.
Gen. Frederick FVnston, 'om~imanod
Ing the border forces, will d(esignate
the time and place for movements: of
guardsmen to the international line as
the occasion shall require.
In announcing the orders. Secretary
Baker said the state forces will be emr
ployed only to guard the border and
that no additional troop movements in
to Mexico are contemplated except in
pursuit of raiders.
Navy Also Busy.
Simultaneously with the National
Guard call, Secretary Daniels of the
Navy l)epartment, ordered additional
war vessels to Mexican waters on both
coasts to safeguard American lives.
At the War. Navy and State Depart.
ments, it was stated that no new ad
vices as to the situation in Mexico had
come to precipitate the new orders.
Within the last. two weeks, however,
tension has been increasing steadily.
The crisis presented by General Car
ranza's, note demanding the recall of
Generab-PelrhiU's expedi. onary fote
has been followed by a virtual ultima
tum served on the American officer by
General Trevino, the Mexican com
mander in Chluhahua. To this was
added the possibility that American
and Mexican troops had clashed across
the border from San Benito, Tex.
Officials Relieved.
Administration officials made no at
tempt to conceal their relief for the
Rafe return of Major Anderson's caval
ry squadron to Brownsville after itr
successful bandit chase. The troop
ers crossed in the face of intimations
that they would be attacked if they
did so. General Funston himself re
ported that he anticipated fighting,
presumably with Carranza troops.
Mobilization of the National Guards
men to support General Funston's line
will pave the way for releasing some
80,000 regulars for immediate service
In Mexico in the event of open hostili
ties with the Carranza government.
The guardsmen themselves could notl
be used beyond the line without au
thority of Congress and until they had
volunteered for that duty as they are
called out under the old militia law.
The new law, which would make them
available for any duty uinder the red
era government, goes into eff'ect,
July I.
55,000 Troops in Service.
The entire mobile regular army in
the United States, several Drovision
al regiments of regular coast artillery
serving as infantry, and the National
Guard of Texas, New Mexico and Ar
izona now are on the border or In
Mexico. Definite figures never have
been made public, but it is understood
General Funston has about 40,000 reg
ulars and probably 5,000 or more
guardsmen, of whom 10,000 regulars
are with General Pershing or scatter
ed along his line of communications
from Namiquipa, Mexico, to Colum
bus. N. M.
Telegrams to Governors ....
Telegrams calling for the militia
were sent to the governors of all
states except the three whose guards
men already have been mustered in,
after an all-day conference at the
War Department, attended by Secre
tary Baker, Major General Scott, chief
of staff; Major General Bliss, chief of
the mobile army, and Brigadier Gen
eral Mills, chief of the militia divis
ion general staff. Brigadier General
McCombs, president of the Army War
College, also were consulted. Since
Mr. Baker did not find it necessary
again to confer with President Wil
son after his visit to the White Houge,
it was apparent the decision to bring
out the militia was reached then.
At Least 85,000 Guards.
By tihe new orders there will be
placed at General Funston's disposal
two major generals and 21 brigadier
generals of militia, with their com
plete infantry commanas. The en
tire infantry divisions from New York
and lennsylyania are called out, as
are 15 full hrigades from other states.
In all. 8S regimnwents of infantry, with
13 separate battalions and many sop
arat e companit-s art affected, giling
a total of 1,14S (:coin panits, (ach of
which must have a mnininllnt strenglth
of 65 nin when mustered into tlhe
fedoral serivice. The lotal liti:: (
force of infan utry, therefore, will be
not less than S,,000 men.

No indicatioln was given at the
State i)(p tmll'nilt w\ith reÂºtarLd to the
r1ly to atGnraal Carranzas note de
rmanding the withdrawai of the
1 American troops now in Mexico. It
; was' prepared last week by Secretary
Lansing, and is still in President
W ilson's bands. It was intended to
dislatcll it to Mexico City by speiial
mniessenger, but recent devolopimnts
may change this plan.
Hear From Carranza.
Official reports that recent raids
along the border had created alarm
among American residents in Mexico
City and elsewhere beyonld the border
were reflected in a message received
at the Mexican embassy from General
Carranza. It was stated that cx'ite
ment prevailed at the Mexican capi
tal over the ominous signs along the
border, and asked Elisco Arredondo,
ambassador designate, to tell the first
chief what he had learned of the in
tentions of the Washington govern
ment toward Mexico. Replying, Ar
redondo included a copy of Secretary
BUiker's statement innouncing thae
call for the militia.
Mexican Situation Worse.
When the officials here learned of
the message to the embassy, it was
construed as a further evidence that
the de facto government is struggling
with elements in Mexico with which
it has little control. For months the
economic situation which Carranza
has been attempting to solve without
foreign financial aid has been grow
ing steadily worse. Uneasiness has
been manifested in many parts of the
republic ,and agitators, whose pur
poses and affiliations are not clearly
known here, have seized the opportu
nity to stir the smoldering anti-Amer
ican feeling all through northern,
Mexico. The Washington govern
meat has watched with growing alarm
the spread of disorders throughout
Mexico and the evidence that Carran
za's control over his army and his
people is waning from day to day.
Up to the time General Thevino serv
ed notice on General Pershing last
week that any movement of his
troops except toward the border
would be treated as a hostile act,
there was no clear indication as to
Carranza's own attitude. His inten
tions still are in doubt, although the
fact that he is said to have personally
directed Trevino's action leaves little
ground for speculation on that score.
Policy Unchanged.
'The question remaining to be set
tied is whether General Carranza will
go to the limit of ordering an attack
on General Pershing's troops. There
is no indication that President Wilson
has any intention of altering his de
termination to keep the expedition
where it is. It is also evident, how
ever, that the administration has no
present purpose of ordering renewed
activities after bandits by the column,
except in the limited zone in which it
has been operating with signal suc
cess for some weeks. General Per
shing's recent reports have indicated
that he has succeeded in clearing out
all organized bands of outlaws in the
vicinity of his camps.
A Game of Bluff.
Sonime officials here have been in
clined to look upon the Carranza note
and many of his other more or less
hostile actions as attempts to placate
the radical anti-American elements in
Mexico, without actually bringing on
hositilities with the United States.
They declare the Mexican government
has gone to the limit each time, but
always fallen just short of tlhe word
or act that would have made a clash
certain. These officials believe Car
ranza is playing a gamne of bluff and
that much as he may hate V'illa, the
direct cause of the present situation,
he dare not attempt to capture the
bandit and turn him over to the
UnitedI Stat.s for punishment, because
he fears to make a national hero and
nlryi-r cf hiis form-r ally ag.ainst HIu
erin. In hit conntecrt:o n "' was lenr'-,

ga result of wounds received during or
after Ithi Columbus raid. lie is said
to be hiding in the hills, and the in
ti liaion that Carranza oflicials could
i put their hands on him in a few days
e if they so desired.
Congress to Take Hand.
The Mexican situation is certain to
I come up in Congress when the two
houses resume active business.
To defray expenses of mobilizing
t the National Guard and maintaining
it in t he federal service, enmergency
Il pproprittions will be needed immiedi
it('l.V. ('ongress grantel the War l)e
partinnt literal enmergency funds be
:lsei of the hbordeir situation some
t time ago. These are virtually gone
now, and Sticret ary Baker probably
will submitt a largiely increased esti
Srmiate within a few days. No official
w:ouldl hazard a guess as to the sum
t that might be needed.
Policy Is Unchanged.
, t;u t'td up, the situation as to Mex
ico wtas this;
i Presidelnt Wilson's policy is un
changed. although he has taken the
last possible step short of calling for
voltunteers to defend the border. Amer
ican troops are in Mexico for that pur
pose and for that purpose only. This
has been stated over and over again
by Mr. Wilson and now has been
altirmed by the Democratic platform
t upon which he will seek re-election.
The platform also states, however, that
the troops are to remain in Mexico un
til the defacto government uses Its
minlitary forces to police the border re.
gion so thoroughly that renewed ralds
5 ing is improbable.
1 The government has little faith fir
) the assurances of General Carranza
r that he is able to do this. Raiding has
I increased rather than diminished
l since additional Mexican troops were I
ordered into Chihuahua and other
northrn states. It has been madel
plain. officials said, that only American.
troops could be counted on to safe
t guard American Interests on the bor"
der.
No Intervention Plan.
Even with the call for militia, ha
ever. It was declared emphatlc?!1
hPre was nothing to indicate that"
tervention plans are being considered
Stress was laid in every official quar
ter on the fact that only defensive
measures were in progress and it was
reasserted that if hostilities between
the two governments are to follow
they will come only from acts of the
Mexican officials.
.oenator Sheppard of Texas received
a telegram from residents of San Be
nito and the lower Rio Grande valley
asking tha. the federal government
furnish them with arms and ammuni
tion for use in protecting themselves
antn their property. The request was
submitted to the War Department,
with a suggestion by the senator that
it be granted. Colonel Bullard, com
manding a force of American troops
near San Benito, is said to have ad
vised the citizens to take steps to pro
tect themselves.
Miss Emily and Her Store.
On the right side of the store, both
in the counter and on the shelves be
hind it, were the notions-spools,
needles, calico, garter elastic and a
hundred other things your mother was
always wanting; while on the left side
were kept marbles, paper soldiers,
lead soldiers, slingshot elastic, air
guns, bows and arrows, slates, whistles,
school pencils, compasses, paint-boxes
and a hundred other things you were
always wanting. Miss Emily sat
strategically at the rear of the store,
I and did not move till she knew for cer
c tain what it was you were after. Now
adays this would be called efficiency.
SIn those days our parents called it
.crankiness. When Miss Emily took
Syour pennies for an "aggle" or a "snap
per" or a big glass "popper," she did so
sternly, and she always examined them
closely as if she expected counter
feits. She never emiled sweetly on
you, and called you "sonny" or "little
-boy." She never smiled at all.-At
lantic.
Salt Mountains.
Several fills of rock salt exist in Al
geria. One of these, near Jelfa, is 300
feet high and nearly a mile across. In
spite of the soluble character of the
material of which it is composed, it
3stands up in high relief from the sur
rounding clay, without any signs of
erosion. There are in it, however, sink
holes, into which the torrential winter
rain soaks, being at once absorbed
and given out again at the base of the
mountain in the form of salt springs.
Imitation Gold.
By combining ninety-four parts of
copper and six parts of antimony and
adding a small quantity of magnesium
carbonate to increase the weight, a
substitute for gold is produced. This
alloy, it is said, can be drawn, worked
and soldered much the same as gold
and it also takes and retains a gold
I polish. It can be made for about 25
cents a pound when its constituents
- can be bought at normal prices.

Baton Rouge. -
A proposed new primary bill, which
would punish party perfidy as a mnis
demeanor and would provide for thel
ejection from a political party of a
participant in a primary who support

The bill would require all parties to
hold primaries on the same date, but
with separate boxes and different sets
of officials. Every voter in a primary
would be required to sign a pledge
on the ballot to support all nominees
of his party. No voter in the prima
ries of any political party would be
permitted to be a candidate on the
ticket of an opposing party, and party
committees would be empowered to
purge their rolls of any member who
assisted any candidate other than his
own party.
Under provisions of the measure,
should the primary nominee of any
party support any candidate of an op
posing party, he could be ejected from
the party that nominated him and the
committee could select another can
didat4. n his place. Participants im
one party's primary also would be
prohibited from contributing funds or

a such a station could be erected for
the purchase price of the penitentiary
1- grounds in Baton Rouge, that the

acquire the penitentiary property for
park purposes, but is reported to have
e pointed out to the committee that the
penitentiary system, with its present
enormous debt, did not have the funds
to make permanent improvements. He
suggested to the commissioner that
Sthey get together with the prison au
thorities, get exact figures on the cost
