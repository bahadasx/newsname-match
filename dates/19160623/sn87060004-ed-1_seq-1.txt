German representatives there hive
encouraged Gen. Carranza in oppos
ing the stay of American troops in
that country. The form of encour
agement is said to be more moral,

the result of the dispute between
Mexico and the United States would
tie to stop shipments of munitions to
the allies and prevent the allied na
vies from getting oil at Tampico, and
also to prevent the United States
from pursuing the submarine contro
versy. Hi named several other Ger
mans who are mentioned in connec
iion with the affair.
