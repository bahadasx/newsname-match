THE LAW AND THE LACKEY.
At the close of the eighteenth cen
tury the families of the Marquis d'An
glade and the Comte de Montgomerie
lived in peace and harmony in a large
house in the Rue Royale, Paris. They
lived rather luxuriously, and while it
was held that most of the marquis'
funds came from the gambling tables,
nobody held that against him. He
was a man of fine appearance and
charming manners, and his wife was
a beauty. De Montgomerie had a for
tune of his own and didn't need to
go to the gambling establishments to
earn his bread in the sweat of his
fingers. He kept a large establish
ment, with servants and horses and
chariots and the d'Anglades lived in
the same house because of the firm
friendship existing between the two
families.
It came to pass that the Montgom
eries decided to go to their country
house for a while, and invited the

pressions of the Comte's Keys.
d'Anglades to go along. The invita
tion was accepted but at the elev
enth hour d'Anglade begged off, say- I
ing his wife had fallen sick. The
Montgomeries went away and there is
every reason to suppose that they 1
had the best kind of a time at their I
rural chateau. They returned to Paris I
a day earlier than they had expected
to, arriving at their home in the eve
ning. The d'Anglades spent the eve
ning with them.
On the following morning Montgom
erie discovered that he had been
robbed during his absence, and the
robbers had made a big haul. They
had opened his strong box with a
false key and had carried off thirteen
bags of silver, several bags of gold,
and a hundred louis d'or of a new pat
tern, not in general circulation, and
a quantity of valuable Jewelry. The
comte sent at once for the police.
The lieutenant general of police
came, with several of his trusty
sleuths, and after examining every
thing he announced his belief that
somebody in the house had stolen the
goods, and he began a search of the
premises. In order that nobody could
accuse him of impartiality, he made a
search of the d'Anglades' apartment
the first thing, before going to the
servants' quarters, and his surprise
and delight may be imagined when he
discovered a roll of 75 louis d'or, of
the new coinage, wrapped up in a pa
per, a part of a genealogical table,
which was at once identified by Mont
gomerie as belonging to him. In vain
the marquis protested that he knew
nothing about the money or how it
came there. His appearance was
against him.
To the astute lieutenant general of
police this was sufficient proof of the
man's guilt. When he went to the
house he expected that it was going
to be a sordid affair, involving a
crooked servant or two, and now he
had a real live marquis in the toils.
His delight may easily be understood.
The case was bound to make a big
sensation, and the lieutenant general
would be covered with glory. From
the moment of finding the money in
d'Anglade's attic, that gifted function
ary bent all his efforts to the one end
-the conviction of the marquis. He
would consider no evidence that led
in other directions.
As a matter of form he went to the
basement, and there found evidence
against the servants far more incrim
inating than that against the marquis,
but when a man is aunting a lion he
doesn't want to fool away time on rab
bits. Alve of the mssing bags of sil
ver were found in the servants' boxes,
but this made no impression upon the
geat policeman. The marquis must
have put the bags where they were
found, in order to throw suspicion
upon the servants.
The prosecution was pitiless and
brutal, and the lieutenant general of
police seemed to dominate everybody
and everything. The marquis protest
ed his innocence, and was ordered to
the torture, but no physical agony
could draw from him a confession of
guilt. H. was convicted and sen
tenced to the galleys for life, and
presently set forth on his mangled
limbs, as a member of a chain gang
bound for Toulon. The story of the
persecution of the d'Anglades seems
more like i cbronie of the dark
ages than a record of modern hap
penings. The marquis, whose life
had been spent in gilded ease, found
the journey torture; and the brutes
in charge of the chain gang seemed to
take a vicious delight in adding to his
misery in every possible way. He
was chosen out for all their barbarity,
perhaps because he was an aristocrat.
League after league he 'Soled along
the eniless white road, his feet bleed
ing, his legs swollen, his body cov
ered with bruises, and his heart
broken.
At last death came to his relief. He
died of exhaustion at Marseilles, and
it is doubtful whether any man ever
greeted the deliverer with greater joy.
Meanwhile his wife had been taken
from a sick bed and dragged to the
bar of justice by the tireless lieuten
ant general, who was fairly basking
in the well-earned fame this case had
brought him. She was found guilty
of something or other, and imprisoned
in an underground dungeon, where, in
cold and slime and darkness, she be
came the mother of a daughter; and
mother and babe were left there with
no attention, except when a piece of
black bread was thrown in, as to a
wild beast. Afterwards the jailor who
did this service said that he ofen
heard the wretched woman moaning,
"Oh, God, why halt thou forsaken
me?" Surely few people have had bet
ter reason to ask the question. But
God had not forsaken her entirely.
About this time a former lackey of
the Comte de Montgomerie's felt with
in him a spiritual yearning. He real
ized that his sins were as scarlet, and
he would be as white as snow. He
wished to become a priest, and devote
his life to good works. With this
praiseworthy ambition in his breast.
he set about undoing the evil he had
wrought, so far as he could. He knew
the truth about the robbery at the
Montgomeries', and he wrote an anony
mous letter to friends of the d'Ai
glades, giving them information which
enabled them to bring the facts to
light. And the facts showed that the
unfortunate d'Anglade had nothing
whatever to do with the crime.
The chief criminal was the Comte de
Montgomerie's almoner, a priest
named Gaynard, who had obtained
wax impressions of the comte's keys.
From these impressions a man named
Belestre made false keys; several
servants of the comte were in the plot,
including the writer of the anonymous
letter. They were all taken into cus
tody and subjected to the torture, one
by one, and in their confessions they
were unanimous in exonerating d'An
glade.
The unfortunate wife was released
from her black dungeon, with her
naked babe in her arms. She was in
a dying condition, but now the sympa
thy of an entire nation was with her,
and she was nursed back to health.
The people of Paris raised a fund for
her, amounting to $20,000, and the
courts made De Montgomerie dig up
a large sum to make restitution for
the property confiscated.
There is only one bright spot in this
tragic story. One morning the lieu.
tenant general of' police, who had been
the lion of Paris for a long time.
stepped out of his door to go to his
office, when a stone hit him on the
side of the head. Then another rock
-or maybe it was a vitrified brick;
anyhow, it was hard, and weighed
eight pounds and a half-took him in
the stomach and doubled him up, and
before he could unbend himself some
body prodded him in the ribs with a
pole. In fact, the whole population of
the street had turned out to do him
honor, and when his servant dragged
him back into the hose he looked
just like a man who has been fooinag
with a ilel drive.
