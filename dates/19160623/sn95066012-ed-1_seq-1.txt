PflOMINENT SPEAKERS PRESENT
Cattle Judging Contest, Canning
Demonstration and Address by
Commissioner Brigham.
Notwithstanding tho- muddy roads
and the unfavorable weather condi
tions, over six hundred people attend
ed the four-county agricultural meet
ing at Weston Thursday. Over a
hundred automobiles from the differ
ent towns in Rutland, Bennington,
Windsor and Windham counties were
parked about the village during the
day and at noon when the basket pic
nic was in order the lawns presented
a pretty sight.
Prof. Thomas Bradlee, director of
the extention service, acted as master
of ceremonies. Dr. Smith of Weston
made .the address of welcomo and the
response was by President Smith of
the Windsor county agricultural assorl
ation.
During the morning session Prof.
G. F. K. Storey presided at a stock
judging contest and kept the attention
of the farmers for about two hours.
Miss Eflie M. Thayer during the same
period entertained the ladles with a
fruit canning demonstration.
At the afternoon session the princi
pal speakers wero Gov. Charles W.
Gates of Franklin. Glen C. Sevey,
editor of the New England Homestead
and Agricultural Commissioner E. S.
Drigham.
The attendance would have been
much larger but for the threatening
weather and bad roads as many who
had intended to be present gave up
the trip when they realized that the
journey was likely to be an uncomfort
ablo one.

OLD TIME DEMOCRATS
Reminiscences of Bennington Half a
Century Ago
Editor of The Banner: During the
recent Democratic convention nt Saint
Louis, the staff of the Chicago Tribune
included "II. L. T." (Bert L. Taylor, a
former Vermont newspaper man) who
edits "The Line 0' Typo or Two."
In one of his letters he dropped Into
reminiscense as follows:
My first Democratic convention was
a Vermont Etate affair and I went as a
delegate presumably "just for tho
ride." like the man who attended the
funeral; for at the time, in the early
nineties, I was running a country week
lv whith was supporting the
Republican candidate for gov
einor. Democratic conventions
in the Green Mountains were
lather good fun, as I remember them.
There was never the excitement of ex
pecting to elect anybody, so harmony
prevailed and a pleasant time was had
by all. Brad Smalloy and Hiram At
kins provided the plot and the dele
gates supplied the almost human inter
os."
It brought to my recollection an
event that occurred In Bennington soon
after the election of James Buchanan
in 1S56.
flic prominent men of the Democrat
ic party In various parts of the state
assembled at the Gates House to ecle
lrnte the victory.
Among those present were Hlrnm
Mkins then of the BellowR Kails Ar
gus, "the bright and shinning light ot
tho occasion."
Erastus I'lympton of Wardsboro, one
of the "Wheel Horses'' of Democracy.
gave dignity to tho gathering, also
Charles N. Davenport, of Wilmington
and others whose names do not come
to my mind now. The local lights in
eluded Beiiejiimln it. Sears, Samuel
Keyes, Knos Kudd and others.
I am not certain whether John 9.
Kobinson was there or not.
The feast was served In a skeleton
shed covered on the top and sides with
Spruce boughs.
As the brick oven was rather small
and the attendance largo and very
hungry, n part of the cooking had to be
done at John Collnrds' bakery. Again
".noting B. L. T. "Harmony prevailed
and a pleasant time was had by all

JAPANESE JOINED
ATTACK
BLUEJACKETS
Fired Upon American Motor Launch
at Mazatlan
CRAFT RIDDLED BY BULLETS
Boatswain in Command Badly Wound
ed and Another Sailor Slightly
Injured.
Washington. June 22.-111 official ad
vices received at the Navy Department
today Commander Arthur G. Kavanagh
commanding the United States gun
boat Annapolis, reports that the Mexi
cans at Mazatlan fired without provoea
tion on the American bluejackets in
the fight which took place on Sunday.
The first shot was fired by an Mexican
customs official in uniform while the
motor launch with the bluejackets
aboard was UN) yards from the dock
and returning toward the ship. Mexi
can soldiers then opened fire and a
party of Japanese Joined them In rid
dling the launch with bullets.
Acting under orders from Command
er Kavanagh the Americans had arms
concealed in the launch and followed
instructions in using them in self
defence. Boatswain's Mate Laughter,
who was senior in the boat, ordered
the (ire returned and the Mexicans and
Japanese fled in panic Horn the dock.
Secretary Daniels made public the
report from Commander Kavanagh.
which he received from Hear Admiral
Winslow. commander in chief of the
Pacific fleet. The secretary made no
comment on this report. It is under
stood, however, that the Navy Depart
ment fully approves the action taken
by Commander Kavanagh and believes
the American bluejackets were fully
justified in resorting to their arms.
Otherwise they would probably have
been killed it is said.
The participation of the Japanese In
the clash is puzzling to officials here.
It is noted particularly that the asser
tion that Japanese did the firing on
the Americans comes from Gen. Mezta
and other Mexican sources.
ft is regarded as probable, however.
that certain Japanese now in Mexico
have become imbued with the nntl.
American sentiment which is sweeping
through that country and that this
explains why the Japanese at Mazatlan
joined in the clash.

ACADEMY CREDITORS MEET

meeting of some of the creditors
of Vermont academy at Saxtons Klver
was held in Bellows Falls Mondav,
when the future of the school was dis

present that provision ought to be

a committee was chosen, consisting of
Eugene S. Leonard of Bellows Falls,
Henry L. Bowles of Springfield. Mass.,
nnd Mr. Fuller of Saxtons Hlver. to
present the situation to other creditors

El Paso, Tex., June 23. It was Capt. j
Morev's detachment that was engaged
in the Carrizal fight on Wednesday and
although no information to that effect
has been received here it is believed
that a detachment of the 11th cavalry
may have been involved in the battle
after the troopers of the loth were am
bushed. Gen. Pershing has arranged to rein
force the troopers in the vicinity of tho
lash of whom no official Information
has been received since the battle on
Wednesday.
Mission, Tex., June 22. Nine officers
and 2HG men of the I wenty-eigiun in
fantry, stationed here for the last
eight mouths, tonight -were rushed to
Fort Ringgold, Klo Grande uiy, 101
lowlng receipt of reports that Mexican
bandits were threatening that town to
night. A machine gun company ac
companied the infantrymen.
That tho best traditions of the Amer
ican army were maintained when
American cavalrymen were drawn into
ambush became known this afternoon
when George Bell, Jr., received Infor
mation that only sixty Americans were
engaged against a Mexican force of
three times their number.
The Mexicans were ambushed and
entrenched and had a machine gun
with whLh to pour their fire into the
Americans, while the negroes had only
their revolvers and carbines and were
forced to charge across an open field.
General Hell's information this after
noon was to the effect that the. Amer
ican command consisted of nothing
more than one troop of cavalry, com
manded by Captain Lewis Morey, who
lost his life In the charge against the
entrenched Mexicans.
The Mexicans themselves admit they
had 200 men and assert that the Ame
ican command numbered about the
same.
The fact that late reports bring the
number of dead down to fourteen Mex
icans and twelve Americans shows the
deadly aim of the American cavalry
men. Although the odds were against
them, thev killed more Mexicans than
they lost in tho light. The first Mex
ican claims placed the American dead
at forty, but this has been scaled down
until the Mexican no longer make any
such claims.
Evacuation of Juarez, following the
vacuation or partial evecuation of the
border towns of Nogalos, Agua, l'rleta,
Matamoras, was tinder way all day to
day. The civilian population was all
emoved from the border last night
and betore daylight this morning all
of the official records, food supplies,
arms and equipment of the towns had
been moved out In a special train. La
ter three train loads of soldiers left,
only enough remaining to police the
town. The belief Is that these will flee
at the first show of American hostili
ty on this side.
With the evacuation of Juarez tin
tier way, American army officials In 'A
I'aso made ready to invade the town at
minute's notice. The officers admit
ted the orders to be ready had come
from Washington, although thev did
not know when actual orders of entry
would be Issued.
They believed tonight, however, that
orders to cross and take charge of the
lauroau terminals migni come at any
minute. Orders to seize the Mcxicun
Northwestern for transportation of sup
plies to General Pershing would not be
unexpected at any time. Report was
current in military circles that an
American expedition would take
charge of the Mexican Central railroad
for the purpose of rushing troops from
here to the vicinity of Villa Arumada
if the force now on the way to that
point and Carrl.al from th el'ershlng
base at N'amliiulpa should need further
hell-
It was slated this afternoon that the
I'nlted States might fee fit to send
soldiers into Juarez at once to take
charge of tho town, on the ground of
necessity to preserve peace and pro
tect foreign property just as General
Pershing did on ' yesterday when he
took command of Ciisas Granites afte
the Carranza garrison desutod It.
General Bell Issued orders today to
keep every soldier In camp and again
tonight the American artillery was
trained upon Juarez. Kxtrii artillery
patrols were placed In the Mexican
section of ll I'aso and every precau
tion taken to prevent an outbreak. The
city was quiet, however, and free of
excitement. Some of the ammunition
and arms dealers carried display ad

Burlington, June 23. According to a

llen inside of a fortnight it will be
necessary to add about 800 men to the

Gov. Gates at Montpelier last night
received a telegram from Washington
inquiring how soon tho Vermont troops
would be ready for service.
The troops went into camp last
night with an average strength of
about 75 men. The Springfield com
pany reached the fort with 101 men
in the ranks. All of the companies re
ported that they were given a rousing
send off in their home towns.
Not much could be done last night
except to pitch the tents and to put
the camp in order but actual training
is in progress today.

line added that "none are for sale to

There was not much of a rush from
Americans to buy as practically every

Washington. June 2.1. Secretary
Lansing yesterday sent a memorandum
to the diplomatic representatives of
South and Central American nations
reiiewing the situation existing be
tween the Lnited States and Mexico
and announced that if hostilities
should eventuate it would not be pos
sible for the United States to defend
itself against invasion and not Inter-
let c with Mexican affairs. The mem
orandum, dated Wednesday, follows:
I enclose for your Inspection a
copy of this government's note of June
20 to the secretary of foreign relations
of the do lacto government of Mexico
on' the subjort of the presence of
American troops in Mexican territory
Tills communication states clearly the
critical relations existing between this
government and the de facto govern
ment of Mexico and the causes which
have led up to the present situation.
Should this situation eventuate into
hostilities, which this government
would deeply regret and will use every
honorable effort to avoid, I take this
opportunity to inform you that this
government had for its object not in
tervention In Mexican affairs with all
the regrettable consequences which
might result from such a policy, but
the defense of American territory
from further invasion by bands of arm
ed Mexicans, protection of American
citizens and property along the bound
ary lrom outrages committed by such
bandits, and the prevention of future
depredations by force of arms against
the marauders infesting this region is
encouraging and aiding them in their
activities.
"Hostilities, in short, would be simp
ly a state of international war without
pin pose on the part of the Culled
States other than to end the conditions
which menace our national peace and
the safety of our citizens."

LOCAL TROLLEY SITUATION
Electric Service in and Out of Ben
nington May Be Tied Up By Strike
Some days ago the trolleymeu em
ployed by the Berkshire Kailway com
pany voted by a large majority to or
der a strike on the lines of the system,
provided the officials did not grant cer
tain demands in relation to an increase
of wages and a re-adjustment of work
ing hours. The vote of the men has
been submitted to the national organi
zation of the trolleymen's union by
whom the vote will have to be confirm
ed before the strike goes into effect.
Should a strike be ordered on the
Berkshire system the people in this vi
cinity will be effected as the Berkshire
company owns the two trolley lines
running into this village from North
Adams and from Hoosick Falls. In
this connection the following letter
from Superintendent Geo. E. Greene
of the Bennington and Hoosick F"alls
division and the statement of President
1 loward Klliott of the Berkshire system
will be of interest:
Berkshire Street Railway Company
Bennington & Hoosick Falls Division
F'ditor of The Banner: As you are
well aware the employees on our en
tire system are asking for very large
increases in wages, while at the same
time they are getting larger compen
sation than are many men in other
lines. If we are not able to satisfy the
men it may result in a strike which
will seriously inconvenience the public.
Mr. Elliott has made a statement which
has been published in the local papers
in North Adams and Pittsfield as a
news Item of general interest to the
public, and 1 am enclosing a copy and
our officials would be very grateful If
you would give it publicity, for it is
such a statement as shows conclusively
that we are now paying far more in
wages that the earnings warrant.
Thanking you very much for your
favorable consideration, 1 am,
Yours very truly,

eleven miles southwest of the Sereth

to the official announcement by Petro

country from the Central Powers.
The fall of Radautz further places

Apart from the success in the south
the Russian offensive made no pro
gress in the last twenty-four hours, but
on the contrary, suffered a serious
check in Volhynia, where tho German
re-enforcements are imparting more
and more stubborness to the Austro
Hungarian resistance, and even have
enabled the assumption of a counter
movement in the center, southeast ot
Kovel. -"'i.!
Further south, on both sides of the
Turja River, west of Lutzk, and down
to the town of Gorochow, north of the
Galician border line, the Russians, ac
cording to. the German War Office,
were driven further back.
Field Marshal von Hindenburg at tho
same time renewed his attacks south
of Dwinsk. While Berlin disposes of
these operations with a reference to
"successful patrol Incursions." - tho
Russian War Office admits that the Ger
mans west of Lake Vishnieff (duo
west of Wilna) captured some Russian
trenches, but add3 that they were
later driven out.
VANDALISM IN CEMETERY
Headstones Overturned and Many of
Them Broken.
About 23 headstones in the new
Catholic cemetery at Old Bennington
were overturned either Sunday or Mon
day night. Some of the monuments
were not only thrown from their bases
but were broken in the fall. Others
that were fastened to the foundations
with lead were also injured.
The ' monuments overturned were
mostly of the single marble slab typo
which rested on a foundation of similar
material. Some were held, in place by
pins through tho bases and others wero
leaded. In Eome instances it would
appear as though the lead had been re
moved indicating that the vandals
were In pcareh of Junk.
The local police have made an in
vestigation but as yet have obtained
no cine that tends to lead to the ap
prehension of the guilty parties.

Albany. N. Y.. June 20 The appli
cation of the New York Central Rail
road company for pel mission to in
crease its passenger lare rate in this
state generally from a two to a two
and a halt' cents a mile basis is denied

establish necessity for the proposed In
crease. owned by tho public and by the New
Haven, amounting to $2,34i;,ouii.oi), and
have n balance sufficient to mako
needed Improvements. In the face of
figures like these it does not seem as
' If wages should be Increased or addi
tional service furnished unless thero is
a substantial Increase in revenuo
which can only bo obtained by somo
Increase in rates of fare.
The Company also. In common with
all other Industrial concerns, is facing
Increased prices for all classes of ma
terial. It has been chimed at times that tho
Company Is asking for earnings to pay
a return on unfair capitalization, but
the results yliow conclusively thut tho
earnings in 1915 were not enough to
pay the Interest on the underlying
bonds, and tills year only a small
amount over that has been earned,
leaving practically nothing for Interest
on the advances of $3 ,30 9, 7 60. 45 which
have been made for extensions and for
miscellaneous betterments nnd ad
ditions to the older parts of the prop
erty. Yours very truly,
