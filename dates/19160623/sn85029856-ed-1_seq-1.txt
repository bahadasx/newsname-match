A. A. FARMER FOR REPRESEN
TATIVE A. A. Farmer, the well known real
estate man on Kansas avenue, has
been selected by a committee of men
to become the candidate for repre
sentative on the Democratic ticket,
and he has consented to enter the
race.
There are few people who do not
"know Mr. Farmer, but many who
. know that he Is associated with his
"brother in the real estate business,
-who deal extensively In lands all ov
r the west and have some Interests
In the eastern section. -
Mr. Farmer has resided In the west
and has been identified in the devel
opment of the western section of the
. ,; f v. ;V;"
, -
:
state for the last 81 years. During
the early days of the development of
Stevens county he helped In the prog
ress of the, county, and nine years
ago he came to Liberal and made ex
tensive investment ' In Liberal prop
erty. He is a town builder. Through
all the vears of the cltv's best build
ing boom he was one of the main
. builders and Is today building houses
to supply the demand. The Demo
crat is of the opinion that he has
. builded ,pore . Residences la Liberal
than any other individual in the city
'during the last past nine years. Be
sides the many residences builded to
Ills credit, he and his brother own
considerable property in the business
section." He Is one of the heavy tax
ipayers of the city and county. His
years of service in the ' west, where
the acid teat of man Is made if he
lives through It all and manages to
inake some money and hold friends,
Is a guarantee that he Is excellent
- material for the position Of represen
tative of Seward county. Mr. Farm
er has often stated that one of the
needful things In the legislature was
members who would lessen the num
ber of laws made and create laws
that must be obeyed, and stop the
practice of making more laws each
legislative session and suffer them to
become violated and perhaps never
known to the people at large. One
Saw obeyed Is better government than
a hundred on the statute books un
noticed, 'And Mr. Farmer Is not
alone in this Idea. The Democrat be
lieves that Mr. Farmer will make us
a good representative.

"38 YEARS SUCCESSFUL MERCHANDISING"
LIBERAL CITIZENS CAN VOTE
FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT.
i
Cities can vote on county superln-i
tendent at the elections this fall, not-;
withstanding a statute to the' con
trary passed by the last legislature. 1
The state supreme court has held,
this act to be unconstitutional, pro
hibiting citizens of cities of the first
and second class from voting for
county superintendent of schools. '
The court held, according to press
dispatches, that the legislature had
no right to abridge the suffrage of ,
voters on any office created by con-
tltntfn Thtt anit ur a a an annllfta. .
tlon for a writ of mandamus against
John Doane, county clerk of Osborne
county.
Under this decision the county,
clerks must include the office of
county superintendent on the ballots"
printed for" first' and second class .
cities for the election this fall.

BILLY ORR'S VERSION OF THE
RACES
' The Ochiltree speedway race was
one of the most successful speed con
tests ever held In this city. I was
agreeably surprised at not finding
more competitors in better shape for
racing. As soon as I looked the
bunch over I realised that I had a
chance for third money. The Hud
son and the little Buick six were the
most thoroughly equipped cars. The
Lblg Buick six and the Pierce Arrow
I knew could make more speed than
"Old Betsy," but their equipment
was bad and they couldn't possibly
last but a little while. The Stuts
and National I was sure I could out
run, and did until they dropped out.
In the first day's lineup I figured it
out right. I got third place.
After receiving the purse for third
money I was congratulated by many
Liberal friends and that evening
John Baughman asked me if I would
accept a free entry for the next
race 200 miles. I did.
I decided to try my luck and rep
resent Liberal and the Eidson Auto
Company once more. Still I felt that
there was a slim chance for third
place, just a chance of luck.
The lineup for the 200-mile race
was as follows: Buick little six, Big
six Hudson, Page six, Pierce Arrow
six and old Betsy. After the flag
dropped everything went well with
us for 75 miles when a wire came off
the spark plug. At 120 miles the oil
pump broke but we filled the crank
case and kept the air pressure on
our extra supply tank pouring a con
stant stream of oil to the motor.
Wilbur Shelton, commonly caller
Sharkey, my mechanician, discovered
this trouble almost as soon as it hap
pened. At 150 miles the center main
bearing began to pound, at 170 miles
I discovered still another knock. My
hopes for second money began to
fade in the distance. Sharkey was
fighting the oil pump bravely with
the hot oil blowing directly in his
face and be finally had to discard his
goggles, being unable to see through
them. '
Poor old Betsy did her very best,
but 200 miles was just 2 too many
miles. There being no other car for
third place it was naturally awarded
to me.
One other thing I wish to mention
and that was that I certainly did
appreciate the cheers and the back
ing given to me by the Liberal people
and my other friends, and to tell
them that in the next race we will
try to win a higher money. .
STEPHENSON TO MOSCOW
E, J. Stephenson, who is generally
known as collector of the the Inter
national Harvester Co., has conclud
ed to take the cashlershlp of the Mos
cow State Bank. He will assume
charge in a short time. The Moscow
bank is a new business but there is a
great chance for good business In the
future.
NEW BAND DIRECTOR HERE
F. K. ' Reasoner ' arrived from
Springfield, Minn., Tuesday, and has

cornet band. Mr. Reasoner is a mu
sician of much prominence and it Is

band. Mr. Reasoner Is also a cigar
maker and if he locates here he will
establish a cigar factory.
HAIL AND WIND
A heavy cloud visible from Liberal
was evidence of mischief in the at
mosphere in the vicinity of Plains
last Saturday evening. Recent re
ports disclose that a heavy wind and '
hail did much damage over a vast'
scope of country in the eastern part
of Seward county and the western
part of Meade county. In Plains
every cyclone cave was crowded to
the limit and those who remained
outside witnessed atmospheric tur
moil overhead that would have laid
the town in waste had it come to the
ground. A torrent of wind and hall
laid flat field after field of golden
grain almost ready for harvest.
Scarcely a field tor miles around was
untouched by the hall and the losses
sustained will range from 35 per
cent to a total loss. Comparatively
few were insured.
Miss Bliss Snedeger and Miss Bes
sie Swant of Tyrone were guests of
Mr and; Mrs Chasv Lorens last week,
Hail may destroy your crops the
night before harvest. See GRIF
FITH & BAUGHMAN and provide
against such a loss.

and all those who knew him can
scarcely imagine that he would shoot

Wichita, Kan., June 21. A cor
oner's Jury here today exonerated H.
W. Collier, a grocer, of culpability
of the death of William A. Goodman.
Collier shot Goodman, who died Mon
day, when he saw him running after
a burglar alarm had been sounded In
the grocey store.

late last night. They Intended to

WHITE FOR COMMISSIONER
E. B. White of Hayne announces
for commissioner from Fargo town
ship on the Democratic ticket in this
issue. Mr. White is one of the pro
presslve farmers of near Hayne and
would make a good commissioner.

for the Equity Exchange at Hayne.

HARVESTING THE GOLDEN
The wheat harvest Is come. A lit-'
tie earlier than was expected, and'
from all indications the yield will be
a little better than was anticipated. ,,'
Monday there were hundreds of :
farmers in the city securing new ma-'.
chlnery, repairs for the old headers -
and securing groceries for the extra ;
harvest hands which have been em
ployed. .
Many of the farmers are as yet '
looking for harvest hands. There
were hundreds of strangers in the
city Monday but many of them were '
not anxious for work. They refused '
to work for $2.50 a day .in the har
vest field, and probably would not.
work worth a cent at any price.
The grain men generally say that
there will be a better quality in the ,
wheat this year. If this is true, even
if the yield should prove less than ,
last year, the price tor the better
grade will mean about the same ',
profit to the farmer as he had last '
year.
. , ; h
dedicated st. anthony !
The St. 'Anthony's church, the new
building recehtly erected- by the
Catholics of Liberal and vicinity, was '
dedicated Sunday by the Rt. Rev.,
Bishop Hennessey of Wichita, as- ,
slsted by four other priests.
A large congregation attended the
ceremonies and heard the able ser
mons delivered a little later. The
Catholics have a very pretty church
and it Is a credit to the little con- '
gregatlon that is supporting the in
stitution. There will be regular'
church every fifth Sunday and ser-
vices at least one week day In the,
month. Father Herman will be in
charge of the churches at Fowler and
Liberal.
