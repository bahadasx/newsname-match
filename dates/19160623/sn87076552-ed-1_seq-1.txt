NATIONAL GUARDS
Enthusiastic Meeting Held Under The
Auspices of The Wauseon Booster's
Club Monday Evening Wauseon
Company to Be Organized One
Hundred and Twenty-one Present.
Following the action taken at their
Annual Meeting on Monday evening
J una 12th to enuorse and co-operate in
the movement to secure a company ot
National Guards, for Wauseon, the
Wauseon Booster's Club through their
co-upeiaung committee ent out in
vitations to nearly two hundred eu
gioM) young men in Wauseon to ue
tns guests of the Club at a meeting
last Monday evening at the Kniai
of Fymiaa Castle Hall. There, wnen
the guests had gathered they found
a lignt supper consisting of sand
wich, salau, pickles- ice cream, cake
and coitee served by the ladies of the
Wauseon Temple of Pythian Sisters.
Tne hall was beautifully decorated in
tie national colors and a tine large
flag was hung at the back of tne
sluice. An orchestra furnished splen
did music. One hundred and twenty
one persons were seated about the
tastetuily arranged tables. At the
conclusion of the repast, President F.
R. Guilford of the Booster's Club wel
comed the guests in behalf of the Club
and announced that the committee had
been disappointed by the inability of
the speaker of the evening, Captain
Harry Kirtland, to be present; he be
ing unavoidably detained in Toledo on
account of the order to mobilize the
Ohio National Guards. Mr. J. F. Out
calt was introduced and very clearly
and tersely presented the proposition
of organizing a company of National
Guards in Wauseon. All that can be
done at the present time is to secure
the signatures of those who will
pledge themselves to enlist in a Wau
seon company, to a petition address
ed to Governor Willis. When there is
an opening as there has been recently
and as there is quite likely to be
again very soon the Governor may
authorize the organization of a com
pany here. The term of first enlist
ment is for three years, all equipment
uniforms and etc. are furnished the
jm-n, there is no cost whatever to the
members of the company except the
time given for drill and training and
after July 1st, all men and officers will
receive during peace times one fourth ,
the pay of men and officers in the
regular army service. In case of ac-j
tual service the pay will be the same
as for the regular army. Members of
the company elect their own officers
for commission as Captain and First!
and Second Lieutenant. There has
been and is no attempt to make up a
slate in the formation of a company
here, the matter of selection of offi
cers must be left entirely to the ma
jority vote of the members of the
company. The National Guards ap
peal to young American men as af
fording an opportunity of giving prac
tical and tangible expression to- the
real patriotism they feel and there is
nothing that a young American man I
can do that is more commendable and
honorable than to register himself as
willing to take (he training and dis-!
cipline that will fit him in case of anj
emergency to defend the flag of his
country and the institutions and prin
ciples for which it stands. The very
fact that the citizens of this country !
are willing and ready to defend any!
encroachments upon the principles, in
stitutions or territory of this country,
when known to the world is In itself
the strongest kind of insurance
against trouble of a warlike charac
ter. There are many benefits that ac
crue' to the individual members of the
National Guards. Many who are fitted
to speak with authority believe that
every young man should have m mili
tary training.
Certain it is that such training
gives invaluable benefits to each per
son who takes it in physical develop
ment and self control.
President Guilford called upon Chas.
T. Stahl, F. E. Kenyon and Irof. C.
I). Perry each of whom responded in
, stirring talks endorsing the move
ment to secure a company of Guards
in Wauseon and encouraging young
men present to pledge themselves to
Join such a company.
Some twenty-two names were secur
ed to the petition and aside from the
primary purpose of the meeting it
was worth all that it may have cost
as affording opportunity for the men
of the community to get together and
get acquainted. The Booster's Club
certainly are royal good hosts and
lose no opprrtunity of manifesting
their good will and desire to co-operate
in every worthy movement.
The movement to secure a company
of National Guards and eventually an
Armory for Wauseon should not and
doubtless will not cease with the
meeting of last Monday evening. The
full number of at least fifty names

The Corner Druggists
should be secured to the petition and
filed with the Governor and when
the opportunity for the placing of a
company occurs as we understand is
likely to occur very soon Wauseon will
stand a good chance of securing such
company.
WASHINGTON ITEMS.
There is a movement on foot in New
York City which has strong backing in
Ohio, to send a ship under Red Cross
Auspices to some German Baltic port
with condensed and dry milk for the
babies of the Central Powers. Speaker
Chump Clark and many Congressmen
among others Russell, Ricketts and
Kmerson of Ohio have written strong
letters praising the project.

Congressman N. J. Sinnoh of Ore
gon has had a bill adjudicating the
claims of certain settlers in Sherman
County, Oregon. The passage of this
bill ends a fight which has lasted 20
yeais. A bill for relief of these set

est old man in southern Ohio" has an

of his political strength. Fess is an
avowed candidate for a third term.
Gen. Keifer was a M. C. from 1865 to
1867 and again from 1905 to 1911.

A WARM GAME.
The ball game at Athletic Park last
Sunday afternoon was far -and away
the best of the season; the full box
score is given herewith. Delta played
a good game but were out classed by
the Wauseon team while Delta's
pitcher struck out six men, Shultz in
the pitcher's box for Wauseon struck
out nineteen men. Delta failed to get
a hit until the eighth inning. The
best hit of the game was the two base
hit by Parker in the seventh inning,
which was followed in the next few
minutes by stealing third and home.
Williams made a play that raised
the fans from their feet when he
threw from left field catching his man
at the home plate; Fraley was there
to put the finishing touches on the
piay by getting the man by a matter
of inches. The score was 1 to 0 in
favor of Wauseon. Delta scoring 2
hits and 2 ' errors. Wauseon making
1 run, 3 hits and 1 error.

Bilious Attacks.
When you have a bilious attack your
liver fails to perform its functions.
You become constipated. The food
you eat ferments in your stomach in
stead of digesting. This inflames the
stomach and causes nausea, vomiting
and a terrible headache. Take Cham
berlain's Tablets. They will tone up
your liver, clean out your stomach.
and you will soon be .as well as ever.
They only cost a quarter. For sale
by all dealers.
I wish to call the attention of pros
pective buggy buyers to the fact that
am prepared to show the finest and
most up-to-date lot of buggies ever
brought to Fulton County. These
goods are bought for spot cash in
car load lots thus enabling me to sell
as low as the lowest. I will not be
undersold on same class of goods. Call
on me before you buy.
