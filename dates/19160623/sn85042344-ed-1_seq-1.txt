few details two Americans pnsslng

General Funston remained fixed in

unless the facts established beyond a
doubt that the Mexicans had been the
aggressors. It was Intimated that
even in that case there would be con

which the Mexican commander had

Two sqiiadrons of the Kleventh cav

with the remnant of tioon II of the

Reports of a routine character
were received from all border points,

Justice Hughes's telegram to the

Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, who
came here Wednesday to confer with
Colonel Roosevelt.
More than that, Mr. Lodge, who Is

It Is believed that tho senator from

the bearer of a message from Justice

fact that Mr. Lodge was there, Is

He was rushed to Ragnmoro Hill.

"Did you discuss Justice Hughes
with Colonel Roosevelt?" he was
asked.
"Of course wa discussed Mr.
Hughes."
"Will the colonel support him "
"I think It very probable that he
will do so."
"Ho you believe his support will be

selected for mobilization.
It was 9 o'clock last night when the
hundredth man had Hlgned his name
to tlm list and the recruiting otlice
at tho corner of Third and liouldcr
was closed. Throughout the day the
recruiting officers had boon be
seigcd with questions as to length of
service, character of duty to be per
formed und as to the probability of
active warfare to be seen by those who
enlisted In tho company being or
ganized. In answer to these the tx-
soldicis gave such definite Informa
tion as they possessed and the roster
was soon increased from 76 to moro
than ninety by evening.
lulling I lie day several young men,
having read of the opportunity pre
sented to Join tho colors in the Tulsa
company, came to this city from sur
rounding towns and placed their
names to the list.
As a result of several of the recruits
huvlng given up their positions in tins
city, a fund was started during the
afternoon to care for those who had
enlisted with the understanding that
they immediately would bo provided
with quarters and rations. This fund
was augmented by funds from several
of the members of the company wiio
gave liberally and during tho noon
hour more than a score were provided
with meal tickets. In thu evening
some, without quarters, were provided
with places to sleep until the mobili
zation orders were received.

a personal representative of Governor
Williams, presented to Capt. Alva J.

Mr. Kenton said that he expected
to receive another message from the
governor within tho next few hours,
advising the local company that or
ders had been issued for their entrain
ment for Chandler. In this event the
prearranged signal of three luiifc

tho I'nlted States government and tlui
