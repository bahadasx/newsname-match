;f:X! After War.11-1
' On a tour of all the . British, oversea.
Lcssessions. to ascertain .what they
will da for the British soldier when
the war is over, Sir- Rider Haggard,
noted English author, passed through
here today on the Canadian-Austtal-asian
steamer . Niagara, on his way to
Canada, where he will complete his in
vestigation before returning to London.
He was sent out as honorary. repre
sentative of the Royal Colonial Insti
tute of London, and has already visited
Africa, Australia and New. Zealand.
"Of course It Is too early yet for
the governments of the colonies to
know just what they will doY said Sir
Rider Haggard,-""but from promises . I
have received my trip has been more
than' satisfactory. . , X: ;
Finds Rhodesia Generous. " ': )
?1 received the most definite prom
ise in Africa, where the government at
Rhodesia has agreed to give a half
million acres for the use of the sol
diers. -This was a very generous gift,
as the land there Is very fertile and
the solfiers who take it up have-an
exceedlr rly plea3ant future in store
for them. ' - '
'In Austr-Ii and New Zealand the
governments have rpFpcmded very sat-
isfittorny; "'rTh'a torcitt.ti3 proniloed
to treat 'every - Eritisli, soldier: -.who
ccmes to their shores just as well as
they arerlanning to treat: th0 men
who hao rone out from there. 4 .
Ccrsliira Problem Serious.'- w t ' .
"just what will ' be done -yrlth the
thousands of soldiers after the war is
a very serious question, and thfs plan
of sending them to settle in the British
oversea- possessions seems -to . be an
excellent method, to pro vide for their
future.-. ' '..-' ; .
"When I left Africa the campaign
there was nrosressing very satisfac
torily, but the country there is so large
that it will ba a month yet before all
the German possessions are taken."-'y.
