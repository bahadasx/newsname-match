along before the court house. They
were the .sons, brothers and sweethearts
of people of Spartan Durg
county?some of them possibly, hus
bands and fathers. They were bound
for tie training camp and for the
Mexican border.
? At 11 o'clock, 45 minutes later, the
i county chairman of Spartanburg
county, Dr. S. T. D. Lancaster,, called
to order in the court house the first
meeting of the State campaign of
1916. It was opened with a prayer

It was a serious, thoughtful crowd

the candidates for State offices
at the opening meeting of the 1916
campaign. The seasons have not
been favorable to leisure at this time

j usually manage, somehow.
! Former Governor Cole. L. -Blease
was the first speaker. He traced
' closely a written manuscript, which
j is published in this issue of The Herald
and :News. Governor Blease usually
has a written speech at the
i opening meeting 01 a uaiupaisu?auu
J he is Always at a disadvantage when
j he does so. 'However, he wants a
; record, and in this manner he gets it.
i He is leading in Spartanburg counj
ty, in the race for governor. The
fight for second place will be between
Manning and Cooper?with
Cooper as a probable second. The
race in the State generally, from reports
received here today, is between
Blease and Manning, but Cooper has
a strength here which ca nnot be discounted.
Representative Audience.
At the meeting here today there
I u-orp npnnle from other coun-1
, r ? r??--- ?? -- I
ties. Newberry had some here and '
Laurens had a good many. The aud- j
ience, however, represented Spartan- j
burg county pretty well.
All the candidates were well received.
There were some demonstrations,
but no unusual enthusiasm for
any of them.
The Spartanburg Journal of this
afternoon says:
"There is only one way in which
to account for the indifference of the
people towards the political situation
and that is that they are satisfied
with existing conditions. If they

racket. This is the only interpretation
that can be put on that situation
as we see it."
The Journal is mistaken as its
editor would have known if he had
mingled with the crowd. There wast
no indifference. There was a differ-!
ence between this meeting and the,
meeting of two years ago and of four j
I yars ago?'but it was a difference ,
which menat the very opposite of |
"indifference." The people were:
thinking.
The "Reformers" say that Blease
is going to be elected on the Irst
ballot on the 29th of August. The
"antis" would eliminate Blease from
a second race. Blease has the tacti1

Spice In Treasurer's Race.
In the race for iState treasurer, Col.
D. iVV. UJcLaurin vigorously attacked
State Treasurer S. T. Carter on his
tficial record. Among other things
he read copies of affidavits which he
said Mr. Carter had made to the effect
that he was not able to educate
his daughters at Winthrop college,
whereas Mr. Carter was receiving
a salary of $1,900 per year as
State treasurer and enough salary as
to the fart that lie was a v.oiueueiaic
veteran, and to ;the work which he
had done in the interest of the veterans.
He said that Treasurer Carter

?1. Paso. Tex.. June 21.?American
and Carranza troops fought a sanguinary
battle today on the Santo Domingo
ranch near the town of Carrizal,
'and tonight it had not been
learned with which side rested the
victory.

here, but nearly a score of Gen.
Pershing's men are said to have heen
killed and the Mexicans are said to
have lost more than 40. Seventeen
Americans are declared by Mexican
officials to have been captured and
to hae been hurried to Chihuahua
City under adequate guard. A machine
gun used .by the Mexicans is

The scene of thejight was just nine
miles southwest of iV'illa Ahumada. j
the Mexican field headquarters in1
northern Chihuchua, and the clash
occurred only a few hours after President
Wilson's 6,000 word note warning
Carranza that the "gravest consequences

The Americans engaged are thought
to have been members of a troop from
the Tenth cavalry, a negro regiment, i
returning from a scouting trip to
Guzman. The size of the Mexican
force, whose commander, Gen. Felix
Gomez, was killed, is not known.
News of the battle was received in
Juarez early this afternoon by Gen.
Francisco Gonzales, Carranza com-:
mander of the military zone of the
border. For some reason Gen. Gon- i
zales kept the story secret until late
in the afternoon when an American, j

from the interior, brought to El Paso!

commander. He charged that the,

fired on the messenger they did so
because it was necessary in order
to insure their own safety.
Gen. Trevino's recent warning to
Gen. Pershing not to send his troops
east, south or west of their positions
was recalled.
According to Gen. Gonzales ne was
informed :by Gen. Gomez at Villa
Ahumada last night of the presence
of the Americans westward between
Villa Humada and Ellevalle. iHe said
he immediately ordered Gen. Gomez
to proceed to the Santo Domingo

This, he says, Gen. Gomez did this
morning. The American commander,
Gomez, is said to have replied that he
was instructed to proceed to Villa
Ahumada and must do so.
The statement issued by the Juarez
commander read:
"Immediately upon learning of the
presence of the American troops in
the vicinity of Carrizal Gen. Felix
Gomez despatched a mesenger with
a request that the American commonHor

the American troops remained motionless.

American troops after he had delivered
his message. The Amricans im- ,

extras were issued and the news became
known. Quiet was maintained
however, in view of Gen. Bell's frequent
admonitions that his soldiers
could take care of any situation that
might arise. While awaiting instructions
from headquarters at San Antonio,
Gen. Bell kept his entire fore-?
in readiness for instant action.
In the meantime, howe-er, word
came from Juarez that all was quiet
although the news of the battle was
widespread there.
Early tonight the only official de
tails of the engagement received nere
came from the 'Mexican side of the
river. Gen. Gonzales said that his information
was transmitted to him
from Villa Ahumada by Col. Genoveso
Rivas, who commanded the Mexicans
after their leader. Gen Gomez, was
slain. Gen Gonzales also gave the
Mexican explanation of "how the two
f?rces came in contact.
