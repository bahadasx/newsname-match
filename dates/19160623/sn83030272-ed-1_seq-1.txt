' One American
Wasiilsoton, June 22. In olllclal ad
vices received at the Navy Oepartment
to-day Commander Arthur O. Kavatuiith,
commanding the Cnlted States gunboat
Annapolis, reports that Hie Mexican at
Mazatlan tired without provocation on
the American bluej ickets In the tight
which took place on Sundnv
The llrst slid was tired by a Mexican

nn tor launch with the bluejackets
aboard was 100 yards from the dock
and returning lownid the ship Mexican
soldiers then opened lire and a party
of Japanese Joined them In riddling the
lauiiih with bullets.
Acting under orders Irom Commander
Knvnnifcli tho Americans had arms con
cealed In the launch and followed In
Uructlons In using them In self-defence.
lloatswaln'H Mate Laughter, who was
senior In the boat, ordered thu lire re.
turned and the Mexicans and Japanese
Hid In panic from the dock.
Several of the Japanese wer wounded
nnd are now reported to bo In the hos
pital. Laughter was hit twice and Is
pnvely wounded Coxswain Sheets suf
fered injuries to his fingers. Mazatlan
Is reported wild with excitement and
practically every Mexican there Id
armed.
Vmerlcnii Action Approved.
Secretary OjiiUIs made public the re
poll from Commander Kavanagh, which
ho received from Hear Admiral Wlnslow
commander In chlei of the Hacllle. iieet.
The Secretury made no comment on this
nport. It is uiul rstood, however, that
-.lie Navy Department fully npproves the
aitlon taken b Commander Kavanagh
and believes the American bluejackets
were fully Justified Hi resortliiK to their
arms. Otherwise they would piobably
have been kilted. It Is said.
The reason which prompted Comman
der Kiivunagh to send a launch ashore at
Mazatlan wan that he desired to ar-
range for taking uboanl ins hnip sucu
Americans as wished to leave the terror
stricken town. He knew that the Mexl.
can authorities had Issued u manifesto

otllcers that the tight started.
Ofllcers at the Navy Iiepartment point
out that the fact clearly indicate that
the American parly tried to avoid ii
clash. Kieii after the two olllcers were
seized by the Mexicans theie was, It IH
explained, no nggressive movement on
the part of the Americans, who. acting
