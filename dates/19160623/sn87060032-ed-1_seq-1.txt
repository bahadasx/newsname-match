f, -VHO WROTE "HOME
I SWEET HOME?"
xBFr Why Not All Remember
Wery man. woman and child
almost, have set and listened
with strained ears, and with wet
cheeks the strains of "Home
Sweet Home." It has been sung
on every stage in the world, it is
old yet every band and orches
tra in the civilized world plays
it. It is the sweetest word in
the world, "for be it ever so
humble, there is no place like
home. ' ' Yet, some of our people
have forgotten the true Senti
ment, the merchant, some of
them, do not advertise in the
home paper, a great many peo
ple do not patronize the home
merchant, and some do not pat
tronize the home doctors, some
do not patronize home banks
some do not patronize working
men, why is all this? It is be
cause we do not know each other
as we should ; it is because we do
not let others know right here at
home, what we have to sell, and
who we are. Some people send
to such firms as Sears & Roebuck
for their merchandise, it is be
cause they are great advertisers",
they let the whole world know
Sheriff S. L. Lewis.
Sheriff S. L. Lewis is one of
the conspicuous characters in the
community conspicuous for his
popularity and numerous friends,
for there are few men in Knox
county who have a larger num
ber, or who stands higher in the
estimation of the public general
ly than does Sheriff Lewis. He
has shown his worth as an
officer, and his record is an open
book. He is now serving his
first term, but owing to the fact
that he is debarred the privilege
of succeeding himself, he is be
ing urged by his friends to be
come a candidate for the office of
jailer, of Knox county, and he
will recieve the support of his
friends when the day of election
is at hand. Sheriff Lewis would
make a most admirable official, as
he has shown himself in his
present office, and while his
many friends would love to see
him continue indefinitely as
sheriff, but inasmuch as this can
not be done, they are seeking to
have him elected to tho office of

time the home merchant has
the same goods and will sell
at the same price. You take the
goods that come from the fellows
who retail, and count your time
ordering, the stamp it takes to
get the order to the merchant,
the fee for the money order, the
freight on the article and the
time you waste coming to get the

are lacking in medical value.
This is one of the reason why the
Herndon Drug Company, the
Rexall Store, under the manage

has gained such a large patron
age in the three years this ener
getic and agressive young man
has had charge of the business,
and given him such high stand
ing as a pharmacist. He devotes
his personal attention to the pre
scription department, using on
ly the purest and best drugs in
compounding prescriptions. He
is a graduate from the College of
Pharmacy in Louisville, and an
experienced, capable druggist in
whom the greatest confidence
can be placed. This modernly
appointed store is stocked with
everything usually handled by a
firm in this line of business, em
bracing all kinds, chemicals, toi
let articles, stationery, candies,
etc., besides kodaks and kodak
supplies. The firm also develops
kodak films at a most reasonable
cost. The proprietors have prov

and Knox county that they are
enterprising and competent, and
their popularity is attested by
the confidence they enjoy among
the medical profession and the
public generally. This firm is
commended to you when in need
of anything in their line.
Logan and Archer.
The automobile has never been
built that does not require the
attention of a competent machin
ist at times, and the opening of
first-class garages and repair
shops have not kept pace with
the increased sale of machines
and the demand for stations in
charge of expert attendants.
There are many repait shops-so-called
but few that have the
equipment for making quick re
pairs for any machine, and work
men of experience and ability to
handle all kinds of jobs. One of
the very best auto stations in
this section of the country, and
one that is recommended to Ad
vocate readers as being thor
oughly equipped, and managed
by a gentleman of reliability, is
the Logan & Archer's garage.
Every known modern device and
machine used in auto repair work
are employed in this modern
plant. The establishment is
owned by Mr. J. E. Archer who
employs only skilled workmen,
giving personal attention to
every job, so it is not surprising
that he has established a reputa
tion for giving prompt and satis
factory service that might be en
vied by many in the same line of
business. In addition to repair
work a general garage is con
ducted and all cars entrusted to
this establishment receive the
best of care. Mr. Archor is
agent for that world.fames car,
the Overland. It has few equals
and no superiors. He also main
tains a department for the sale
of supplies, as well as being
agent for the Firestone and
Miller tires,
The Peerless Cafe.
When the Peerless Cafe, of
which Mr. A. D. Smith and
James Miles are proprietors and
successor to "Uncle Ike", open
ed its doors under the present
management about two months
ago, it supplied a loug-felt want.
It ftin establishment where the
people of this vicinity can go and
get the very best service obtain
able, as well as good meals at all
hours of the day. It U neatness
itself, and arranged so attract
ively that even within the short
time it has been operating
it has become the favo
rite of hundreds who prefer and
desire an exclusive establish
ment of this kind. You not only
get the best the market affords
but courteous treatment as well.
A fine soda fountain is also
maintained where one can get
the most refreshing drinks it is
possible to dispense. A line of
choice cigars, tobacco, etc. be
sides confections are also hand
led. The bill of fare includes
everything from a sandwich to a
regular meal, temptly prepared
by skilled chefs and served by
courteous and obliging attend
ants. The Peerless is commend
ed to you as being a place worthy
of your patronage in every par
ticular. Miss Sallie Hoskins.
Prominent among the retail
establishments of Barbourville,
and that is well and favorably
known to the trade of the city
and county, is that of Miss Sallie
Hoskins, on Main street, Bar
bourville's popular and up-to-date
ladies store, which is stock
ed with a complete line of every
thing needed in millinery and
kindred lines. She will show
during the season a new and dis
tinctive line of Fisk hats.
Miss Hoskins might be termed
one of the pioneer merchants of
the town, having been continu
ously engaged in business here
for upwards of 20 years, and by
her courteous treatment to the
trade and carrying such a desir
able line of goods at all times as
appeals to even the most dis
criminating trade, she has built
up a business that is a credit to
herself as well as being a factor
in the mercantile business of
Barbourville. Miss Hoskins'
stock comprises a line that is es
pecially attractive, showing the
very latest and newest creations
in the market. There are no
out-of-date goods carried in her
store, but all are the latest styles
and patterns. It will be to the
interest of those contemplating
making purchases in her line to
first call and inspect her varied
stock before buying, as she can
please even the most exacting
and particular dresser, from the
conservative to the more con
spicuous ones. Miss Hoskins is
a reliable merchant in every par
ticular and any representation
made you can be depended on.
Baileys Switch.
The people of Bailey's Switch
are all well pleased with the pros
pect of the pike building for the
long expected work has started
and we are sure the work will be
shoved right through for some of
our most energetic citizens are
at the back of the work shoving
it.
Mr. George Woolum and Miss
Myrtle Parrott made a very
pleasant trip to Dishman Springs
Sunday and reported a nice time.
Mr. II. F. King has returned
home from Middlesboro where he
has been employed in the plant
industry.
Mrs. V. D. Jackson and Mrs.
Edd Jarvis and Miss Carrie Jack

Mrs. H. E. Jackson Sunday.
There has been two carload of
tile culverts unloaded at Baileys
Switch for use on the pike it

discard our "mud-holes."
John Jarvis passed through
here (Friday morning enroute to
Pinfyille.
The mercantile interests of no
town or community is complete
without a first-class jewelry store
a place where everything in this
line can be found; goods that are
new and desirable, and at rea
sonable prices. There is just
such an establishment in Bar
bourville, and which is a credit
to the town and community. This
is the store of Mr. D. C. Payne
who began business here about
4 years ago. and by keeping in
stock at all times a seperior grade
of goods, he has built up a most
flattering business. He is a gen
tleman of the progressive type,
genial and obliging. There is
hardly anything in the jewelry
or silveware line as well as dia
monds that you will be unable to
secure from Mr. Payne. His
vast, stock comprises the newest
and most stylish things in jewelry

watch repairer. You could not do
better than to give Mr. Payne a
call. He also does engraving.
You can depend upon him in all
your dealings. He also handles
cut-glass, pictures and goods of
this character. They are all de
pendable goods and reasonably
priced.
Dr. A. L. Parker
Of the many professions of
men, there is none that has made
more wonderful progress than
that of dentistry. It is today
playing one of the most impor
tant parts in ailments and dis
eases of the human family than
any other profession. Dentis ry
and surgeory are so closely allied
that one is dependent largely up
on the other. Diseases and in
firmaties are daily traced to de
fective or abnormal teeth. Here
is where a skilled dentist is need
ed is indispensible. In tho per
son of Dr. A. L. Parker Bar
bourville and Knox county have
a surgeon dentist that has few
equals in the country. He is a
graduate from the Louisville Col
lege of Dentistry and has every
modern appliance and equipment
for the successful practice of his
profession. He is a Knox county
man, a gentleman of the highest
standing, is reliable and trust
worthy in every particular. Those
needing the services of an aggres
sive and competent dentist could
not do better than to consult Dr.
Parker, whose office is on Knox
street, in the Parker building.

J. T. Beddow
There is not a line of business
;n any town that when nronerlv
conducted appeals to the public
more than does a well regulated
grocery store. When you order
groceries your first thought is
will they be fresh and desirable.
Like other lines of business there
are always candidates for your
patronage, but every store is not
prepared to give you the high
class goods and the service you
demand. In Barbourville there
is never a doubt in the minds of
those who trade with Mr. Beddow
but that they will be served with
the very best grade of goods.
Starting out (25) years ago with
the determination of pleasing his
patrons, he has not failed to live
up fully to the high standard set
by him in the beginning of his
career. His large and varied
stock consists of everything need
ed for the table. He is a Bar
bourville citizen, haii" ;pent
most of his life here, and is liked
by all who know him. He is
reliable and progressive and has
the interest of the community at
heart. When you need groceries
call Mr. Beddow; he can please
you.
J. Fred Catron.
When the impartial chronicler
of events shall record the true
character of the public men
identified with Barbourville and
Knox county, few men will take
precedence, as an attorrney-at-law,
a well-balanced and an in
dependent thinker, over that of
J. Fred Catron, the well-known
and popular county attorney who
is now serving his first term as
the choice of the people. It too
frequently happens that we are
prone to attribute to the noisy
political Thersites the palm of
merit. But it is to the conserva
tive, quiet, philosophical thinker,
the man of judgment to whom
we owe the success of courts and
laws. Mr. Catron is a man of
ability, and valued official of the
county. If tho character of
measures advocacted and put
through, is an indication of his
individuality and forcefulness.
then he stands out pre-eminently
as one of the most valued men
with whom the laws of the
country and town are entrusted,
for it was the subject of this
sketch who so bitterly fought
