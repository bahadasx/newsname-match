PEACE CAN'T BE
GERMANY FALLS
Allied Forces Must Sweep Enemy
From Their Soil and Crush the
Militarism of Prussia.
RUSSIAN MINISTER SPEAKS
Allies Were Never More Firmly linked
Thau at present and Never Were
More confident of Ultimate Victory;
Peace .suggestions Nw Regarded

(By William Philip Slmms.)
PETROGRAD. June 23 (Copy
righted. ) Peace must come only
when allied mill him been swept clean
cf the enemy and Prussian militarism
forever crushed. A. D. Sazunoff, Rus
ilan minister of foreign affairs, told
the United Press In an exclusive In
terview today.
Sazonoff has Just returned from the
Russian front. He said: 'Germany
set upon us without warning Now,
having signally failed to beat Kuropc
Into submission and rinding lu In
tended victims getting the upper hand.
It covers its face with a mask of pi
ety and endeavors to throw upon the
allies the blame for making the war
aj ( I
Such procedure Is an open avow
her weakness and an attempt to
her own unenviable situation - a
hide
fact
which 1 believe the world will soon
realise If it does not already. Peace
talk now la doubly rutlle. Germany
assuredly has not won the war. Hence
Germany Is not In a position to say
anything 1 cannot say yet that we
are the victors, so the peace sugges
tion is unfriendly to us. Germany's
power is cltarly waning. The strength
of the allies Is Increasing The war
can end but one way and that in when
allied territory is swept clean of the
eneinv and our every demand admit
ted. "To accept peace earlier would be
shirking our duty. Civilization has
reached the crossroads One way
means the mailed fist and the will of
the strongest. The other means the,
right to enjoy individual culture.
Prussia set out to Impose upon our
destiny It was willed that the allies
should defend ench other. We are
faithful to our trust We are mutual
ly pledged to do that We were never
so united or never so strong as now.
'We wish peace as ardently as any
one, but It must be of the right sort.
Peace must be permanent. which
means that Prussian militarism must
go. It Is (his militarism that wc are
combatting, rather than Germany."
Asked about commercial relations
with the United States, he said:
"1 see no real obstacle to the clos
est commercial relations between Rus
sia and America The Idea has my
hearty support. I quite share your
able ambassador's expressed views. To
like each ether better we need only
get better acquainted"
lie said he greatly appreciated Am
erica's generous steps to feed the un
fortunate people of Poland
"The population there has been
badly treated by the enemy. They
continue to remove all available pro
visions, thus increasing hunger and
suffering Russia already has shown
appreciation of the endeavors to re
lieve Poland by permitting food (o
enter the country, despite the fact that
Germany might take advantage of the
situation and divert part of the sup
plies for Its own use. I regret deeply
that Germany refused to agree not to
remove the foodstuffs already there''
He declared that the spirit of the
army was excellent and that the offi
cers and men are thoroughly confi
dent of success.
