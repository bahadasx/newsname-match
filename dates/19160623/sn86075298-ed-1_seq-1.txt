BULGARS BEGIN
AN OFFENSIVE
ROUMANIA MAY GET IN
Paris, June 20.-The Havas corre
spondent in Saloniki telegraphs that
news has just been received there that
Bulgarian troops in the region of
Florina and Monastir have begun an
advance.
Monastir is in Southwestern Serbia,
near the Greek frontier. Florina is
across the border, about seventy-five
miles west of Saloniki.
There has been no important fights
ing along this front since the conclu
sion of the Serbian campaign, al
though local engagements have taken
place from time to time.
WHAT WILL ROUMANIA DO?
Fall of Czernowitz Has Big Diplomatic
Value.
Paris, June 20.-"What will Rou
mania do?" is the keynote and the
headline on all comments in the morn
ing newspapers on the capture of
('zernowitz by the Russians.
Although forecasted some time ago
the news has been received with en
thusiasm.
All the newspapers agree that the
diplomatic results of the fall of Czer
nowitz far exceed its strategic value.
They point out that the city is the
capital of Bukowina, the Irredentist
province of Roumania, which was
promised to the latter country in the
event of her joining the allies.
Bukowina has twice formed a part
of Roumania and the possibility of its
return to the kingdom for a third
time has been eagerly seized upon by
the leaders of the Pro-Ally party in
Roumania.
The interventionists have lost no
time and dispatches from Bucharest
say that they have opened a vigor
ous campaign and are confident they
will be able to bring Premier Bratiano
over to their side.
HEAVY FIGHTING CONTINUES
Russians Advancing on Kovel Meeting
Desperate Resistance.
L-ondon, June 20.-Heavy fighting
between the Russians advancing to
ward Kovel and the Germans under
General von Linsingen is reported by
the Berlin Tageblatt's correspondent
at Austrian headquarters, according
to an Amsterdam dispatch to tle Ex
change Telegraph company.
The Russians are in superior num
bers and the dispatch asserts that the
Tageblatt account of the fighting is
worded so as to prepare Berlin for
the news of another Teutonic retreat.
The Tageblatt says the Austrians
have taken up fresh positions between
Czernowitz and the Dneister, where
they are awaiting further Russian at
tacks.
In the Middle Stripa sector, on the
direct line to Lemberg, the German
general, Count von Bothmer, is re
ported to le maintaining his resist
ance against heavy pressure by the
isssians.
UNCLE JOE IS SARCASTIC
Terms President Wilson Biggest Czar
We Ever Had.
Washington, June 20.- Joseph G.
Cannon, in the house, declared Presi
dent Wilson is the biggest czar Amer
ica has had. Mr. Cannon said:
"Without speaking disrespectfully
of him, your president, nominated to
succeed himself, has made respectable
all preside::ts in the history of the
country by sending down his arbi
trary c(::mmands to the house and sen
ate.
"Talk about Czar Roosevelt and
C(ar Jackson and Czar Grant and all
the other czars we have ever had,
they could not be any bigger czar
than Wilson.
"But, after all, God knows, it is
holy writ that whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth. We have had four
years of it. I think we have had our
full dose."
BRAGDON IS FOUND GUILTY
Mlinneapolis Clubman Convicted of
Assaulting Girl.
Minneapolis, June 20.-Joseph W.
Bragdon, Minneapolis clubman and
former wholesale grocer, was found
guilty of the charge of assaulting
Irene Potvine, a fourteen-year-old girl.
There were three possible verdicts
-not guilty, guilty as charged or guil
ty of attempted assault. The jury
found Bragdon guilty as charged. The
maximum penalty is seven years in
the state penitentiary.
C. B. Elliott, chief counsel for the
defense, gave immediate notice of a
motion for a r.ew trial. Judge Daniel
Fish said he could not hear the motion
until sentence had been imposed. He
said he would Impose sentence Thurs
day.
BODY OF MRS. MEUILLIER
FOUND AT SAND POINT
Word was received in Ronan last
Friday that the body of Mrs. Abe
Meullier had been found at Sand Point.
It was stated that identification was
possible only from the clothes on the
body. decomposition having taken
place and the features being unrecog
nizable. Interment was made at Sand
Point.
The deceased was for several years
a resident of Ronan and her husband
was engaged in the blacksmithing bus
ines here at the time the reservation
opened and for three years afterward,
retiring only after his health failed
him. After several operations Mr.
Meuillier died at Sand Point during
the winter, about Christmas, and left
a family of five children and his wife
in destitute circumstances.
When found the body was lying along
side a log on the road leading to a farm
they had owned when first moving to
Sand Point and it is thought she had
started out to the farm and had satj
down on the log to rest, when an at
tack of heart failure ended her life,
This is conjecture, however.
Her sister, Miss Anna Lemouel of
Ronan, was in Sand Point at the time
of her disappearance and returned
home after every possible effort had
been made to find the body. She
brought one of the orphan children
with her and the little girl is still in
Ronan. Three of the children were
adopted by people in Sand Point and
Ithe other one taken to Canada by an
aunt. Mrs. Meuillier carried some
fraternal insurance.
UNUSUAL SIGHT, SNOW
FOUR INCHES ON JUNE 21
People of Ronan witnessed some
thing Wednesday morning, June 21,
which they probably never saw before
anywhere, unless in extremely high
altitudes or in the Artic regions. This
was four inches of snow on the ground
and sidewalks.
Monday evening, June 19, it com
menced to rain about 9 o'clock and
there was a heavy fall all night and up
to noon Tuesday. Then snow com
menced falling and continued almost
uninterruptedly until Wednesday morn
ing. For several hours the snow melt
ed as fast as it fell but toward evening
considerable snow could be seen on the
sidewalks and ground and in the morn
ing of Wednesday there was a good
four inches. It melted all the time
and it is estimated more than a foot
of real water fell. The ground has
not received such a soaking in years.
Many of the fruit and shade trees
are badly broken but aside from this
no damage is thought to have been
done. Some fields of winter wheat
may be down pretty bad but it is
thought it will straighten up again; if
not, some damage will result.
The material advantage will more
than offset any damage, however, as
all spring grain will be many fold bet
ter than without the storm. Spring
grain is certain to be a large crop and
most fall grain will be benefitted also.
The range will again put on a heavy
growth and taking all things into con
sideration the rain and snow will be of
great benefit to the whole valley.
Farmers from near the Round Butte
state that the snow was fully two feet
deep there Wednesday morning. It
began snowing Tuesday morning and
kept it up until after midnight, the
fall being the greatest ever seen there
at any time of year. They are well
pleased over the moisture, however,
asserting that the damage done will
be more than made up by the good it
will do the spring crops, which are
practically assured.
FARMERS' PICNIC AT MIS
SION CREEK LAST SUNDAY
The farmers from Moiese valley, the
Big Flat and other sections held a
picnic on Mission creek last Sunday at
the point where the Dixon road crosses
the creek. More than 100 people were
present and a delightful time was had.
The baskets were loaded with good
things to eat and everybody enjoyed
the day. County Agriculturist J. R.
Campbell and F. M. Lawrence, secre
tary of the Western Montana Fair
association, were present and each
made a short talk on interesting topics.
Notice
All persons interested in the erection
of the proposed Central School on the
Big Flat are requested to attend a
meeting to be held at Elliott school
house on the evening of Saturday,
June 24.
R. A. CALKINS.I
SECOND MONTANA GUARDS
TO DO MEXICAN SERVICE
President Wilson has called
upon all the states to mobilize
the state militia, and the Second
regiment of the Montana guards
has been called to service. Pre
parations were made at once to
receive the state troops at Fort
Harrison at Helena and most of
the companies were expected to
arrive there yesterday. Adjutant
General Phil Grennan has had
charge of the mobilization and
all the companies will be recruit
ed up to war strength, making
the regiment constitute 1800 men
and 32 officers.
The state troops will be sent
to the border between Mexico
HAIL STORM
PLAYS HAVOC
The storm last Sunday played havoc
with the growing crops over a large
area southwest and west of Ronan.
Dr. Resner came in from his ranch
early Monday morning and reported
that [the farmers in his section had
harvested and threshed the day before,
and upon being pressed for an ex
planation stated that the hail of the
evening before had completely wiped
out the growing crops on his farm and
those adjoining, including Dave Morris,
Charles and James Ozmun, George
Gierke and others. Later in the day
it was telephoned in that all the sec
tion west of the Round Butte was sim
ilarly visited and that the crops looked
like everything was about ruined.
The storm came up from the south
west and those in town who closely
observed the clouds were heard to re
mark that it looked like hail, but when
it struck Ronan and no hail fell it was
supposed that their fears were ground
less, but it seems not.
It is stated that the fields Monday
morning presented a blackened ap
pearance, much as if the vegetation
had been burned. It is feared that
very little will be saved from a vast
territory and the loss will be serious.
The hail fell in great quantities and
the size of the hail is said to have been
prodigious. Great quantities of the
hail was still to be seen on the ground
Monday forenoon.
H. C. Keller of 19-21, was in town
Monday and says all his winter wheat
was ruined by the hail. That he had
75 acres all headed out nicely and that
it was simply pounded to small pieces.
He says he will commence this week
to summer fallow it and sow to fall
wheat in August. He mentioned about
half a dozen of his neighbors who have
practically lost all their crop.
Wm. H. Gerdner, living at the Hill
side school house, tells a similar story.
Says his crop looked like a field that
had been cut, and that it is a total loss.
Both gentlemen state that the rain
fell in torrents after and during the
hail storm and that the hail stones
were the largest they ever saw. Mr.
Gerdner lost a number of chickens and
two fine shoats, killed by the hail.
The hail storm went in streaks and
jumped from one field to another, skip
ping some farmers in its path. Those
who escaped must carry a talisman
with them or else have some stand-in
with the elements which would be
worth money to their less fortunate
neighbors.
Republican Club
Owing to the inclement weather, due
to the heavy snow fall last Tuesday,
there were only a few who came out
to organize the Republican club called
to meet in Scearce hall. Those who
attended did not deem it wise to organ
ize until more were present and decided
to call another meeting for next Tues
day evening, June 27, when it is hoped
more will attend. The meeting will be
held at 8:30 and everybody, especially
the ladies, are invited. It is to be
hoped there are a sufficient number of
live republicans in Ronan and the sur
rounding country to form an organ
ization, and next Tuesday will deter
mine whether there are or not.-Com

Sunday's Storm
Numnerous stories come in concerning
the storm last Sunday evening. Much
hail fell at Missoula and points between
there and Crow creek just south of
town. Places on the Big Flat report
hail of unusual size, followed by a
heavy fall of rain. At Missoula it is
said that the rain fell in sheets and all
along the road were evidences of a
heavy fall of rain. Between Crow and
Mud creeks very little rain fell. From
Mud creek north the rain again showed
signs of being heavy and at Poison and
north from there the wind blew fierce
and much water fell. Those from Ro
nan who attended the ball game at
Somers and went across the lake in the
boat report a bad storm, with the boat
pitching badly and in danger most of
the way. Not only from the high sea
running, but from the logs and drift
wood which would rush past the boat,
endangering its safety every minute.
It is said to have been about the worst
storm on the lake for years. At Ro
nan the wind blew pretty strong for a
short time but no damage resulted and
no apprehension was felt at any time.
PERCY M. ROSS GETS
RECLAMATION CONTRACT
Percy M. Ross received a telegram
from Washington last Fridap announc
ing that he was the successful bidder
for a big reclamation contract in Valley
View.
Mr. Ross had just finished his Nine
Pipe contract and will move immed
iately to Valley View where he will
commence on the new work.
In this connection it may be said
that word comes from Washington that
preparations are under way to use the
$750,000 appropriation for the Flathead
and prosecute the work to as near
completion as possible this year.

The first prohibion meeting on the
reservation will be held at Round
Butte church, Sunday, June 25, at 3 p.

TO SAIL AT
TOP SPEED
Pacific Fleet Going
to Mexico.
WINSLOW IN COMMAND
Warships Will Be Prepared to
Land Marines,
San Diego, Cal., June 20.-The cruis
er San Diego, flagship of the Pacific
fleet, with Admiral Cameron McR.
Winslow on board, was prepared to
leave for either Guaymas or Mazatlan.
The cruiser Chattanooga left for Aca
pulca and the cruiser Denver left soon
afterward for Salina Cruz.
The United States destroyers Hull,
Hopkins and Truxtum sailed from San
Pedro to accompany the San Diego.
The cruiser Milwaukee will follow in
a few days when necessary repairs are
completed.
The warships are under orders to
proceed to the west coast of Mexico
at top speed. The ships' bunkers were
filled to capacity with coal and large
supplies of meat and other stores
were taken on board.
The cruisers Colorado and Pitts
burg, the latter the flagship of Rear
Admiral Fullam, commander-in-chIef
of the Pacific fleet, will sail to join
the ships under Admiral Winslow.
Including ships now in Mexican wa
ters Admirals Winslow and Fullam
will have a fleet of seventeen cruis
ers, gunboats and destroyers for what
ever duty required.
May Land Bluejackets.
That Admiral Winslow contemplates
landing a force of bluejackets and
marines on Mexican soil in an emerg
ency was indicated by the fact that
officers and sailors of ships owning
motorcycles were requested to bring
them aboard.
It was understood Admiral Winslow
would form a motorcycle squadron for
scouting purposes if he found It neces
sary to land bluejackets.
The sudden ordering of the Pacific
fleet to Mexican waters was made
necessary by a series of disturbances
at Mazatlan.
The situation became critical Sun
day, when an ultimatum, amounting
practically to a declaration of war
against the United States, was served
on Commander Arthur G. Kavanagh of
the gunboat Annapolis by General
Flores, Carranza governor of the state
of Sinaloa.
General Flores has taken a hostile
stand against Americans and it was
his refusal to permit Americans to
leave Mazatlan that resulted in the
clash Sunday between bluejackets of
the Annapolis and Mexicans charac
terized as Carranza soldiers.
WASHINGTON READY
FOR OPEN WARFARE
WaXlington, Tune 20.--Ppon Gener
al tarranza's reception of a stern re
fisal to lieud his demands for recall of
American troops from Mexico hinges
the question of a Mexican war, in the
opinion of President Wilson's close
advisers.
They were prepared for the possi
bility of open hostilities after the
note, which will be sent forward at
once, has reached Carranza's hands.
No indication has come that the
first chief's attitude of lnhplacable hos
tility would be shaken by the reiterat
ed declaration of the latest communi
cation that the United States has no
aggressive or warlike purpose toward
Mexico, but is firmly resolved to pro
tect her borders and end brigandage.
in the border states.
While the diplomatic steps were in
progress the nation was stirring
throughout its width and breadth
with the movement of national guards
men mobilizing to guard the border.
At least 100,000 and possibly a tar
larger number were prepasing for ac
tive service under President Wilson's
call.
For the present their mission will
be purely one of defense; but should
war come they will be ready also for
that. No marching orders for the
new forces had gone out as yet. They
will not be assigned for border duty
until mustered into the federal serv
ice.
