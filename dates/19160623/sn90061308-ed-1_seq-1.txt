BATTLE WITH MEXICANS.
FORTY AMERICAN SOLDIERS
KILLED BY CARRANZISTAS
Carranzistas and Negro Cavalry Clash
Ninety Miles South of El Paso.
Seventeen Taken Captive.,
El Paso, Jun e21. American and
Carranza troops fought a bloody bat
tle today only a few hours after Pres
ident Wilson's 6,000-word rebuke yes
terday to General Carranza had gone
forward to Mexico City. With which
side victory rested is not known.
The engagement took place on the
Santo Domingo ranch near the Mexi
can town of Carrizal, which is nine
miles southwest of Villa Ahumada,
the Mexican field headquarters in
Northern Chihuahua. The number of
dead, American or Mexican, was not
definitely known here tonight, but
nearly a score of General Pershing's
men are said to have been killed and
the Mexicans are said to have lost
more than two score.
Seventeen Americans are declared
by Mexican officials to have been cap
tured and to have been hurried to Chi
huahua City under adequate guard.
A machine gun used by the Mexicans
is reported to have done heavy execu
tion. The Americans engaged are
said to have been members of a troop
from the Tenth cavalry, a negro regi
ment, returning from a scouting trip
to Guzman. The size of the Mexican
force, whose commander, General Fe
lix Gomez, was killed, is not known.
News of the battle was received in
Juarez early this morning by General
Francisco Gonzales, Carranza com
mander of the military zone of the
border.
For some reason or other General
Gonzales kept the story secret until
late in the afternoon, when an Ameri
can, J. C. Huppel, returning to the
border from the interior, brought to
El Paso the news that he had seen
numbers of Mexican dead along the
Mexican Central railroad track at
Villa Ahumda, and had been told
that there had been an encounter with
the "gringoes."
General Gonzales' first step after
i confirming tfce-.'iews was to issue a
statement placing the blame on the
, American commander. He charged
that the American troops fired first on
the Mexicans and that their shots were
directed at a courier who had just pre
sented to them a request that they re
tire. American army officers declare ab
solute disbelief of General Gonzales'
assertions. The opinion was express
ed that if the Americans fired on the

COST OF MILITIA WILL
BE QUARTER MILLION A
DAY, IS U. S. ESTIMATE
Washington, June 21. Only a
rough estimate can be made of the
cost of keeping 100,000 national
guardsmen along the border. It has
cost about $10,000,000 to keep forces
varying from 25,000 to 40,000 regulars
for threes months.
This is at the rate of a little over
$100,000 a day. Proportionately the
militia would cost $250,000 a day.
The American soldier, will continue
the best fed in the world at a cost of
more than 30 cents a day per man.
His rock-bottom ration per day is: A
pound of canned meat, 12 ounces of
bacon, a pound of hard bread, over an
ounce of coffee, sugar and salt. To
this even when campaigning the com
manding officer is supposed to add
whatever supplies money can buy.

MAN THREW SELF
BEFORE TRAIN AND
IS CUT TO PIECES
Victim, Whose Identity Has Not Been
Established, Meets Death on Fris
, co Tracks One Mile East of
Nichols
Springfield, June 22. An unidenti
fied man between 21 and 24 years of
age hurled himself in front of Frisco
freight train No. 39, west bound, one
mile east of Nichols Junction, accord
ing to witnesses, and was ground to
pieces at 5:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon. The remains were taken in
charge by Coroner Will C. Lohmeyer,
who will probably conduct an inquest
this afternoon.
The man, according to a number of
section men who were at work on the
tracks west of Springfield, was walk
ing west on the north track, used by
the Frisco only for freight trains in
and out of Springfiled. His peculiar
actions attracted the attention of the
section men who watched him for
eome distance.
When but a few hundred yards be
yond the place where the section men
were working the engineer of Frisco
freight train No. 39, noticing the man
on the tracks, blew the engine whis
tle and the man stepped off the track
on the engineer's side. Just before
thO train reached the point where he
stood, tha. man plunged headlong
across the. track. The engineer
brought the train to a standstill as
quickly as the speed would permit,
but not before the engine and eight or
ten cars had passed over the body.
The man's body was badly mangled,
the lower limbs being severed in sev
eral places and the torso being cut al
most in two. The man, Coroner Loh
meyer believes, is between 21 and 24
years old. He had light hair, with
blue eyes, and was smooth shaven.
He wore button shoes, a pair of new
overalls, blue shirt, black striped
pants and woolen socks.
ARMY BILL PROVISIONS
Following a rough passage between
the House and the Senate, the regular
army bill finally emerged safe, though
a bit seasick, landing in the executive

plan only a memory. The bill pro
vides for 606,000 men peace strength
and 73,000 additional for an emer
gency. An interesting provision of the bill
is for vocational training of the men
in the regular army under the direc
tion of the Secretary of War, and the
proposal to maintain government nit
rate plants, the product of which will
be used for fertilizer, when not needed
in war times.
The President is authorized to in
vestigate the mobilization of the in
dustries of the country in time of
war, to add effective unity of private
interests with those of the nation,
should the emergency arise.
Enlistment in the regular army is
now fiied at seven years three with
the colors and four in reserve, which
sounds like militarism, but it may be
only a phase of preparedness which
has been "paraded" into popular fa
vor. It was a long and perplexing con
ference, but both Senator Chamber
lain in the Senate and Chairman Hay
in the. House feel that they have a
last provided an army bill that will
meet the necessities of the times, as
viewed from the standpoint of a peace
loving nation. "Affairs at Washing
