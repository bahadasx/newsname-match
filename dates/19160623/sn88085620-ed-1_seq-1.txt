Everett Shingle Weavers
Arrested On False Charge
CHIEF KELLY AND HIS TOOLS TAKE SIDE
OF MILL OWNERS TO DREAK STRIKE
Brothers S. Patterson, William
Stevenson and John Clark, members
of tho Shingle Weavers' Union, who
were peaceably picketing in front of
the Tower hotel on Hewitt avenue
Wednesday evening, were arrested by
Patrolman Stykes and booked at
headquarters on a charge of disor-'
derly conduct.
An automobile, in which were New
ton Jones, an ex-mayor and a member
of the civil service commission, and
two strike-breakers, one of which was j
the now famous Bill Wildes, who was
arrested and fined $100 and costs for
drawing a gun in a confectionery
store about a year ago, stopped tern- j
porarily for some unknown reason in
front of the Tower hotel, when, it is
alleged by the Weavers, Bill Wildes,
sitting in the front seat, drew a gun
at one of the strikers who happened
to be near at the time. John Clark
immediately went in search of a
policeman, met Patrolman Stykes and
told him the case and wanted him to
arrest Wildes. In the meantime Bill
Wildes had shifted his seat to the
rear of the automobile, dropping the
gun on the floor. Patrolman Stykes
asked Bill Wildes if he had a gun, and
Wildes replied "No,' but the Weavers
©LINGER FOR CONGRESS
Brother R, J. Olinger of the Elec
trical Workers has been nominated by
the Socialist party of Washington
through a referendum vole of the en
tire membership for congress to repre
sent the Second congressional district.
Brother Olinger's record as a union
man is clear cut on the issue of decent
living conditions for the working
class. He has never yet been accused
of non-union conduct. He is always
to be found on the firing line of labor
in a skirmish with the boss.
The fights Brother Olinger has had
with the masters of industry are too
numerous to mention, and although
th" Journal is non-committal in poli
tics we predict that should he be re
turned to congress, he will prove the
most valuable asset that organized
labor has ever had in any legislative
body.
He is a master of wit and logic, has
a keen perception, an unerring judg
ment and an unswerving determina- ]
tien to fight for labor's freedom, and!
we believe the cause of labor will be
advanced a thousand fold should labor
decide to send him to congress.
"Here's success to Brother Olinger." j
CHINA IS TAKING OVER
ITS TELEPHONE LINES
Peklng<—Even old-fashioned China]
knows enough to own and operate its
teelgraph system, and it is rapidly
taking over its telephone lines, too.
Very few private telephone companies
are left in this country, and the.se will
soon be acquired by the government.
The surprising thing is that the
systems are not only efficiently ad
ministered, but that, in addition, they
yield excellent profits. The receipts
from the telegraph last year were
$3,000,000, nearly $1,000,000 in excess
of expenditures. Rates 'for sending
telegrams are very low.
LUMBER TEAMSTERS WIN
Philadelphia. -Teamsters' Union No.
470 defeated the Lumbermen's Asso
ciation and has won the right to
unionize every yard in the city. Wages
are increased and better working con
ditions assured
NEW YORK PAINTERS WIN
New York. Painters in Greater New
York have won thftir May 1 strike for
$5 ■ day. About 12,000 workers are
benefited, Brooklyn tontractors ac
cepted the new rates three weeks ago
and this week the Master Painters'
Association of New York City proper
hoisted the white flag.

insisted it was on the floor of tho
auto, where it was found, between
Wildes' feet. The officer picked up
the weapon and was in the act of
placing it back in the automobile
when Clark insisted that the officer
retain the weapon to be used as evi
dence against Wildes, The patrolman
told Clark that he was talking too
much and. placing the Weavers under
arrest) told them to get in the auto
and drive down to the police station.
Arriving at headquarters, some pe
culiar things happened. Chief of
Police Kelly and Newton Jones went
into a private room for a conference,
the Shingle Weavers say, and De
lective Wells, who was acting as desk
sergeant at the time, demanded that
the Weavers put up $10 bail each, but
allowed Newton Jones to bring Wildes
and Sabin on his own word without
hail to appear at police court Thurs
day morning.
At the trial before Judge Dootsou
on Thursday morning it was shown
there was no evidence to warrant
their arrest on a disorderly conduct
charge and the case against the
Weavers was dismissed, Attorney
Dailey conducting the defense for the
Weavers in a very able- manner.
THEORY OF UNIONISM GAINS
Indianapolis.—"The same bugaboo
that for a long Ume hampered govern
ment clerks has handicapped the
formation of school teachers' unions,"
says the editor of the official Journal
of tin 1 Bricklayers and Masons' Union.
"Both held to the theory that theirs
was a profession, and felt that there
was a loss of dignity in allying them
selves with the ranks of union labor.
Both have paused under the dome of
reflection and now realize the fact
that they are salaried employes, that
they are subject to the same economic
forces that regulate the wages of tho
carpenter, the bricklayer, the crafts
man of all trades and callings, and
both are realizing as never before that
dignity is added to their calling by
placing themselves in the ranks of
unionism and not trying to pose as a
class apart from the operation of
economic principles."
GYPSUM WORKERS ADVANCE

Federal l T nion has secured a one year

UNIQUE COMPENSATION
Heferee Champion of the Pennsyl
vania state compensation board has
ruled that a child, yet unborn, is en
titled to compensation benefits. The
award will begin at the birth of the
child and continue until it is 16 years
of age.
The father of the unborn child was
killed January IS on the dock on the
Williamsport Coal Company. At the
time of his death he was receiving a
weekly wage of $18.70. Referee Cham
pion rules that from the birth of the
child and until 300 weeks afterward,
the widow and child are to receive
$8.41, or 45 per cent of the dead
father's wages. At the end of the
300 th week, the child itself is to re
ceive $2.50 a week, or 15 per cent of

the child is legally in being and en
titled to consideration the same as a
born child.
STRIKERS REJECT OFFER
Philadelphia.—By a secret vote the
John B. Stetson Company strikers
have rejected an offer to return to
work. Practically every one of the
900 men and women declared that the
offer meant a return to industrial
slavery that has been the rule in this
j hat manufacturing plant. The strikers
are as determined to stick as the day
they suspended work, March 1. This
attitude is a shock to the company,
which has for years endeavored to
develop a "trust-the-boss" spirit
! among .its employes.

May Arrest Burns in
Wire Case
District Attorney Expected to
Issue Warrant After Seymour
Signs Formal Complaint
William .f. Burns, foe of labor and,
friend to himself—a pretty good
friend, too may have a chance to se«
what a police court looks like from
the other side. It seems that at least
a temporary cheek will be pul upon
thai gentleman's activities In behalf
of J. P. .Morgan & Co., which so far
have consisted of breaking into of
tices, Installing telephone "taps" and
detecta-phones, rifliim desks, and
copying private letters.
The star detective, long the white
haired boy of the National Erectors'
Association and other labor-hating or
ganizations, is the subject of a com
plaint drawn up yesterdty afternoon
iti Chief Magistrate McAdoo's office.
Frederick Seymour, whose office tele
phone was tapped, announced that he
would sign the complaint, and James
M, Heck, counsel to Burns, was cour
teously notified to have bonds ready,
.lames M. Beck is one of the gentle
men who are still excited because the
United State s did not go to war after
the sinking of the Lusitania. In that
case there would have been more war
orders for Morgan. Burns' employer.
It is expected at the office of the
district attorney that a Warrant for
the arrest of Burns will be issued this
morning. The complaint to he signed
by Seymour charges "copying ami
publishing" private papers from the
latter's office. Seymour was expected
at Bwann's office yesterday, bul could
not reach it in time to have the war
rant issued and the arraignment take
place, before Chief Magistrate Mc-
Adoo had adjourned court for the day

Outcome Of Preparedness
A Timely Warning to Wage Workers Against

Orders have been issued from the
War Department at Washington for
mobilization of all militia tor border
service. Tin's Is the first time tins

ican war.
What does this mean to you. Mr. '
Worker? Under the nick military |
law, which is alleged to be an eleventh
hour bill, every male between the age
of 18 and if) yearn can be legally
drafted for service by the Federal
Government when needed.
This is the echo of your franchise
lor good men for off'ce In the past
I 'steen years. The despised radicals
have pointed these things out to you
time and time again.
Preparedness actually means war
with all its horrors, heart aches,
empty homes, maimed, blind and help
less victims of the god of greed, and
Ithi se victims are always members of
the working class -your class.
What tire you going to do about it,
Mr, Worker? Have you any quarrel
with your Mexican fellow worker,
whom perhaps you have never seen,
but who is righting for freedom to

TART TALK AT CONFERENCE
New York.—At the public hearings
between railroad managers and their
train employes over the question of
eight hours and overtime in th"
freight service, the workers' repre
sentatives, as usual, are proving quite
competent to defend their position,
whether it be by their facts or in a
running discussion. This was shown
when President Stone of the engineers
said that many men never saw their
families except on Sundays. One of
the managers said "these conditions
existed for years."
"We know it," said the engineer,
"and we want you to pay for it. This
is a case where the chickens come
home to roost. The companies have
built up their schedules on long
hours —"
"Hut the men are getting a fair
day's wage," said General Managt r
Lee of the Pennsylvania railraod.
"And the companies are getting a
good day's work." retorted Stone.
Later on the Pennsylvania railroad
man said his side "would have to look
at things pretty hard to get any con
solat ion."
"These demands were not intended
to give you any consolation," he was
told. "They were intended to give the
men some consolation."
"That's very clear, thank you," an
swered the railroad manager

A M Zieler, 12 Charles street. New-

"Dear Sir —No doubt you will be
surprised to hear from me If you
can remember the last of April, when
you were on your way Kast. I was
employed by the Pennsylvania Kail

reason they could not organize.
"Well, the answer is, 1 am fired,

WHY I AM OPPOSED
TO PREPAREDNESS'
(Aii exercise written for the Poly
Prep History Class by W. Guertin
Turtle, 11 years old.)
1 am against "preparedness" he
cause:
1. It is not human to kill human
beings.
2. Christ said. ' Thou shalt not kill."
3. When people say "Be patriotic,"
ili.il does not mean to go to war
4. Germany could not come over
here.
5. She and all other nations are
bleeding to death.
6. The German fleet is bottled up
in the Baltic Sea.
7. If they could i- r et out. England
would not allow them to come here.
8. Some say the Germans could lie
off Sandy Hook and bombard New
York. Where would our fleet be?
9. We have the third largest navy
in the world
10. We spent millions for warships,
but these can be sunk by a submarine
that costs only half as much
11. Some people think thai the Ger
mans started the Mexican war. It
really is the ammunition people, who
make millions now.
12. These people want to get a
large army, and when you have an
army you want to fight. If there is a
war the munitions people will pet
rich.
13. In olden times, yvhen a tribe got
, angry, two men would have a fight.
. After that came dueling. Now is the
. age when we OUghl to set He quarrels
. with our minds and not brute force.
14. We should have one navy and
