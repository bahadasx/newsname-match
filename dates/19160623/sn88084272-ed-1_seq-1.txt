Mock Heroics May Not Save Mexico From
MILITIA ENTRAINS:
ORPET LETTERS
Pleads With Marian Lam-
bert For Love; Later
Missives Grow Cool.
Waukegan, III., June 23 At today's
session of the trial of Will H. Orpet,
charged with the murder of Marian
Lambert, David P, Jo sly c, of counsel
for the prosecution, resumed the read
Ins of Orpefs letters to Marian.
"Keep yourself for me alone," he
wrote on Mav 26. 191S. Th next dav
he complained: "The only tray I could
get through my classes today was by
thinking there would be a letter from
you, but there was none. There le no
fun In anything without you. Try to
love me, for that means more to me
than anything in the world." This
letter, like the others, was written
from Madison. Wis, where Orpet was
attending the university of Wisconsin.
On the 17th, he acknowledged re
ceipt of a letter from Marian. "I
couldn't tell from your letter whether
you are for -me or not. What have I
done or failed to do?" he asked. "Don't
write that way. If you love me, loosen
up."
On June 2, he expressed happiness
at a "good letter" from Lrarian. "Only
about ten days and I shall see you and
kiss you very much. I am glad you are
still good."
By November 3. after the summer
vacation, Orpet addressed her merely
as "Dear Marian." and spoke of seeing
her on Thanksgiving. "But I suppose
you don't care," he wrote,
In this and subsequent letters he
had stopped pleading with Marian for
warmer expressions of her regard.
The state rested its case, after several
more letters the .youth wrote to the
girl had been read.
