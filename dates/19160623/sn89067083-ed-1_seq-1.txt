Prepare Drive On flessiaai
Fly.
"The most glgantio drive that1
has ever been delivered against
the Hessian fly is now being pre
pared by Missouri farmera in
every wheat growing county of
the state' says T. J. Talbert, as
sistant professor of horticulture
at the University of Missouri at
Columbia. Aceording to : Mr.
Talbert, the fly is now intrenched
in the flax seed and maggot etage
between the leaf sheath and stalk
at the bottom of the wheat plant.
The enemy will remain In this
position until fall, thus providing
the farmer an opportunity to deal
him an effeotive blow at his
weakest point.
t During the months of July,
August, and September the tren-
ohes of the Hessian fly oan easily
be taken without artillery prepa
ration. As soon as praotioal af
ter harvest, the farmer will ad
vanoe in the open to the first
line trenches In the wheat stub
ble fields, and by the use of the
diso, harrow and drag he will
bury the enemy deeply beneath
the soil.
In order to make the destruc
tion of the enemy complete, his
food supply must be out off. This
otn be done by disoing and har
rowing the plowed ground to
keep down volunteer wheat.
The fly will make his general
attack upon the fall wheat dur
ing September and October after
which he will take his enoamp
ment for the winter at the base
of the wheat plants. As the life
of the fly is only four or five days
in the adult stage during whioh
time the eggs are deposited on
the wheat leaves, it is advisable
to sow the wheat late enough to
escape the egg laying ct the main
fall brood of flies.
The fly free dales for Missouri
are about as follows : For north
ern third of state, Oot. 1; cen
tral third, Oot. 8; eouthern third,
Oct. 16. It the fly is allowed to
intrench himself in early wheat
and volunteer wheat in the Bum
mer and fall, he may emerge the
following spring in numbers suf
ficient to do great harm to wheat
that was sown on the fly free
date. To make a suooessful
fight against the enemy, co-operation
is necessary and cannot
be too strongly emphasized.
