Two Dollars Per Year
Floods and fVashouts Tie Up Traffic on the Great Northern
Farmers' Picnic to
Be Held June 26
County Agriculturist and
His Assistants to
Preside
A letter from F. S. Cooley of
Bozeman College makes the
announcement that County
Agriculturist J. 'M. Davis
will conduct a Farmer's Sum
mer Picnic at Cut Bank on
June 26th and 27th, assisted by
Miss Katherine Jenson and
W. L. Beers, President of the
Big Sandy Farmer's Produce
Co., whith; according to Prof.
Cooley, has added $100,000 to
the receipts of the farmers in
that community the past year.
Mr. Davis had discussed the
question of a farmer's meetng
with local farmers, earlier in
the spring, but nothing had
been heard of the matter re
cently. Following thiü an
nouncement it is probabl e
that action will be taken to
provide a good program, one
that will be both educational
and entertaining. This will
be an especially propitious
time of the year to hold such a
meeting and all the farmers in
the Cut Bank section should
make plans to attend.
Dem. Ladies Active
The Women's Democratic
Club of Cut Bank was organ
ized here last Saturday even
ing, and 49 ladles were enrolled
as members. Mrs. Reddan was
appointed temporary chairman,
after which the following of
ficers were elected: Chairman,
Mrs. Reddan; Secretary, Mrs.
Yunck; Treasurer, Mrs. Hughes.
The Ladies of the newly
formed democratic club gave a
card party and luncheon last
evening, in the Teton Cafe. A
number of mere men sauntered
in about the clase of the session
and as a penalty for their in
trusion were asked to deliver
speeches. One or two of the
bravest arose and gallantly
paid homage to the fair
politicians, but several others
played the part of the modest
violet and blushed like coy
young things when called upon.
Modesty did not prevent any
single male person from par
ticipating in the luncheon,
however.
Miss Agnes Geng returned to
Hastings, Minn., recently after
an extended visit with her
sister, Mrs. Tracy Poor.
W. M. Holcomb is here from
Minnesota and is a guest at the
F. H. Worden home.
Harlow Casar, a rancher from
the Sunburst section, was here
Tuesday, on the trail of a horse
that strayed from his place re
cently.
Sleepless Nights
and troubled days are the portion of the man
who "takes his own insurance risk."
Is the possible saving of a few dollars worth
the worry during the crop growing season?
If your crop is hit by hail a whole year's Work
will be pounded back into the earth
And to bemoan your luck and rail at Fate will
little avail. The business man takes no chance.

Aha! We warned you that
it might happen. With their
feet firmly planted on native
soil, the Browning boys came
back and lavishly, for the stings
and arrows of outrageous base
ball fortune, suffered here
Sunday a week ago. The home
actors were accompanied by a
delegation of the most lo
quacious fans in town and the
band started to go, that is, all
of the band members started,
but an auto carrying a part of
the musical talent decided not
to function any longer, in the
vicinity of Blackfoot. That
settled the musical part of the
"progrum". The ball game was
won by Browning, score 15 to 10.
The "rubber" will be played
here on the Fourth and it
promises to be the season's
superlative outdoor event.
The local team will play
amateur talent here on Sunday,
for the purpose of developing
esprit de corps and team work.
Downpour Three
Days; Warm Now
Sun Shines On a Smiling
Scene; Crops Grow
Apace
The Cut Bank section receiv
ed another wetting down this
week. For three days low
clouds hid the face of the sun
and a cold rain descended.
Weather observer C. N. Thomas
stated this morning that the
precipitation was about an inch.
The rainfall so far this June is
a little under that of last June,
with about two-thirds of the
month gone.
The sun arose this morning
and ascended a clear blue sky,
and the prospect now is for
warm weather. Vegetation is
stretching upward at a truly re
markable gait. This section
never presented a more beauti
ful scene at this season and the
promise for a big harvest was
never better. Favorable weath
er in July and August will do
the business. Farmers declare
that we stand a chance to pro
duce a crop that shall rival that
of last year. If that should
prove true the prosperity of
this commnnity would know no
bounds and land values would
soar to much higher levels.
It)er is Progressiva
I. A. Iverson. who is keeping
his Electric Theatre up to big
town standard, has purchased a
projector, which cost over $600.
This machine does away with
the eye-straining and otherwise
objectionable flicker action of
the cheaper mechanisms.
Dexter Gerrish was in from
his ranch near Demers last
Saturday. Dexter recently
secured an addition to bis land
holdings by instituting contest
against an abandoned claim.
The Great Northern Railway is experienc
ing the worst tieup in many years and main
line traffic is in a state of utter demoralization,
due to washouts on the line in Montana, east
and west of Cut Bank. The first trouble was
experienced early in the week, when a heavy
downpour in the Eureka section washed out
the tracks for miles and almost carried the de
pot away, it is said. Later tracks went out
near Whitefish and big slides occurred in the
Rockies, on the west side. Monster bridges
have been swept from their moorings in that
section and great earth and rock slides in *that
vicinity ha^e wrought havoc. It is said that
in a couple of places the roadbed has been
washed from under the ties and rails, leaving
them extended in space. The Flathead and
other smaller streams are turbulent floods,
leaving their banks arid inundating great areas
in the Flathead valley.
Slides occurred on the Havre-Great Falls
line, stopping all traffic. The Marias bridge
near Naismith went out some time Thursday,
stopping all traffic between here and Great
Falls. So Cut Bank is walled in on the west
and south, as far as train service is concerned,
our only ingress and egress being the main
line, which is not in the best of shape between
here and Havre, it is said.
No. 3, the Glacier Park Limited, is the only
train running along this part of the main line.
No. 3 is supposed to carry mail to the isolated
denizens of this town, but what mail we have
received thus far this week could be brought
in by a lowly Greek on a broken down hand
car. There seems no good reason why this
should be so. Irate citizens have been haunt
ing the postoffice, gazing wistfully into vacant
boxes and muttering things that sound like the
noise of a street car turning a corner on a cold
day.
Local railway heads informed the Pioneer
Press this morning that traffic on the main
line from here west would probably be re
sumed in three or four days. Hundreds of
men are now at work repairing the damage.

Parents Mourn
Mr. and Mrs, George Lockie
have the sincere sympathy of
the entire community in the
loss of their baby girl, Marion,
aged about two years, who suc
cumbed to acute stomach trou
ble last Sunday evening, after
a little over a week's illness.
The almost constant attendance
of local physicians and the un
ceasing vigil of the parents and
nurse were unavailing. This is
the second sorrow that has come
into the Lockie home since their
coming to this section. About
three years ago a baby boy was
taken from their home after a
brief illness. Their great grief
occasioned bv Death's second
visitation can well be imagined.
The funeral services were
conducted at the home on Tues
day afternoon, by Martin Van
Demark, and were attended by
a large number of sympathizing
friends. The remains were in
terred in Crown Hill Cemetery.
Home Boys Are
Called to Colors
Cut Bank Boys Marching
To Distracted Land
on South
The crisis below the Rio
Grande will from henceforth
hold more than cursorv interest
for the people of Cut Bank.
Several of her young men are
marci.itfg away to join the
colors, in defense of American
lives, American honor and
American property.
P. E. Bulen, owner of the
Cash Store, Sergeant of Com
pany C., Montana Militia, was
the first to receive the call.
His going away meant a great
sacrifice to his business, which
he has built so successfully in
a brief time but he did not
hesitate where duty called and
at once began preparations to
join his company and go to the
distracted lands of the south.
Harrison M. Keenholts, Cor
poral of Battery B., Minne
apolis, received the call soon
after. Mr. Keenholts at once
resigned his position at the G.
N. station and prepared to go.
He will join the Shelby militia
boys and will later affiliate with
his regiment on the border.
His wife and little baby are at
present in Minneapolis.
James Allison, member of the
Choteau militia, is also prepar
ing to join his regiment. Dick
Dorenboos, foreman of the
Frank Stulft ranch, will join the
Kalispell company of which he
is a member. We understand
that a number of other Cut
Bank young men are preparing
to enlist at once.
The war with Mexico has ac
tually begun, according to late
press reports. A clash occurred
at Carrizal the other day in
which a number of American
soldiers were killed, the Mex
icans using machine guns effec
tively—guns that no doubt had
been furnished them by the
good grace of the United States.

Drainage Now Is
A Serious Matter
City Council Discusses it
At Meeting Monday
Evening
The drainage of Lower Broad
way has become a more serious
problem than ever since the
Great Northern began the work
of filling the "Dismal Swamp"
surronding the G. N. Hotel.
Everyone is pleased to see the
"Slough of Despond" filled in,
but the problem presented in
the drainage of that section
becomes graver then formerly.
The matter was discussed by
the council on Mondav evening.
Mayor Potter explained the
situation, stating that the G. N.
was filling up the hole on Lower
Broadway to city grade. If a
torrential rainfall should occur,
the water might be backed up
Broadway to a height that would
mean the flooding of every
cellar and basement on the
street. It would be possible
for it to back up to a height
four inches above the basement
line of the Halvorson store, he
said. On motion Mayor Potter
and City Clerk VanDemark
were instructed to take the
matter of drainage of that
section up with Supt. Doyle
of this division.
The question of permit ting
the Cut Bent Telephone Co. to
use the streets for its poles was
discussed at length. Manager
Bom boy asked that the council
grant him the use of the streets
until 1919. He explained that
the present poles would have to
be removed about that date and
new ones installed and when
this change became necassary
the poles would be placed in the
alleys. This seemed a fair pro
position. The council instructed
the clerk to draw up a franchise
regulating the working of the
system and granting the com
pany certain privileges as well
as levying certain restrictions.
The council confirmed the
mayor's appointment of Math
Teterud as street commissioner
and Mr. Teterud was also
made an officer of the law, this
being considered necessary
when offenders against the law
are placed at work on the city
streets.
The revised water rate or
dinance was given its first
reading by the city clerk.
H. R. Cahan, formerly
stationed at Glasgow, is the
new agent at the G. N. station.
Mrs. Cahan will arrive here in
a few days.
Postmaster Rigney is back on
duty, having completely re
covered from his illness.
