it is understood that f*apt. Hobbs receivcd
later instructions to hurry his
general muster and send Jhe troops forward
at the earliest possible moment.
?'apt. Hobbs refused to confirm this.
In Field All Morning.
All the morning the troops were in
the field rushing their Intensive training
and whipping themselves into
shape. They began their extended order
work, the drill in preparation for
battle with the Mexicans, when they
are scattered about over the ground so
as not to furnish a target for any attacking
force.
They had not learned of the issuance
or the orders wnicn instructed mai
they be placed in service as soon as acceptable.
but there was an undercurrentof
eagerness to get away from the
Radio ? arnpground and further to the
south, where they could get a taste of
the servo e for w hi' h they w ere called.
"When are we going to the front?" was
the question asked by most of the men
when they met friends who might have |
Hews of the operation* of the troops.
They are eager to go almost to a man.
and they can hardly wait for the formal
mustering ceremony and the arrival of
camp equipment.
Kroro now on it is expected that they
will receive drills and drills and drills as
they never have before, in order that they [
may be whipped into shaj>e and hardened j

The papers for the formal mustering

saying they would be supplied In "due

prepare them on account of the clerical
work and the examinations, before the
men can be formally accepted into the
United States Army. It will be some
time next week probably.
There will be a rigid medical examination
of the men who are going into
the service, for the regular officers require
that the men must be in the very

Parents Loath to Give Consent.
Seasoned United States volunteers
probably by the end of next week. This
seems to be the program for the men
now in this camp, or rather the great
majority of them, for some will be
turned down on the physical examinations
and others will lose their onward-to-Mexico
prospects on account
of their youth. The men under twentyone
and above eighteen must have the
written consent of their parents, and
there will be very few consents given,
judging by the number of parents who
have made their appearance at the
camp since it was established here.
The great majority of those young men
whom their parents or guardians are
trying to get relieved from the possibility
of seeing active service against the Mexicans
are those who enlisted since Sunday
night, when President Wilson issued
his call to the local troops?young men
with red blood and a strong desire to see
active service against those who are testing
the meaning of the "colors."
Mustering Regulations.
Under no circumstances will these young
men be enlisted, except upon the conditions
outlined. Paragraph 15 of the mustering
regulations of the United States
Army is explicit and leaves the mustering
officer no discretion. It says:
"A minor will not be enlisted or
mustered into service in the volunteer
army without the written consent of
his father, only" surviving parent or
legally appointed guardian. When
minors are presented for muster on
muster-in rolls, mustering officers will
require of company or detachment commanders
the production in each case
of the written consent of the parent or
criinrrliu n Ihiu to fn ?? ...I...!
the muster-in roll to the adjutant %ei\eral
of the army. In the ease of recruits
enlisted on enlistment blanks,
the evidence of consent will appear in

23.?Whether the little force of

under Capt. Charles T. Bovd,
fought their way out successfully
through the ring of Mexican
troops which had almost surrounded
them at Carrizal June
21, still was unknown at Gen.
Funston's headquarters today.

back to the main column before
the fighting at Carrizal had ended.
Complete Report Expected Soon.
Gen. Funston expected a complete report
at any moment, however, as it was
believed Gen. Pershing soon would have
word from the two squadrons of the
11th Cavalry which he sent out to meet
and reinforce Capt. Boyd's men.
Gen. Pershing's preliminary report
stated that he had warned Capt. Boyd
before the latter left the main column
that he was on a reconnoitering expedition
only, and that he was to use
every precaution against precipitating
a clash with Mexican troops. The fact
that these instructions had been given
Is taken by army officers here to substantiate
the story of the stragglers
that the attack was unprovoked by the
Americans, and made without warning.
Fear Command Wiped Out.
Fear that the casualties suffered by
Capt- Boyd's command had been very
heavy was expressed by army officers
here. .It was pointed out that if twelve
men had been killed, as reported
through Mexican sources, it would
mean that from thirty-five to forty
had been wounded, according to the
usual proportion. These, with the number
reported from Chihuahua to have
been captured, would account for practically
one troop, of 50 per cent of the
command.
Indeed, from the reports available so
far it is by no means certain that Capt.
Boyd's command was not practically
wined out.
Quiet Where Troops Are Near.
EL PASO. Tex., June 23.?Andreas
Garcia, Mexican consul In El Paso, reported
today that all was quiet at points
where Mexican troops were in the proximity
of the American forces.
Reports were received here that the
seventeen negro troopers taken to Chihuahua
after the Carrizal fight were being
brought to Juarez to be turned over
to American authorities. Consul Garcia
was unable to confirm the report.
American guns command the situation
at every important border point today.
Field artillery has been mounted on hillocks
in the larger communities, the noses
of their/guns pointing in a southerly
direction, while in the smaller towns
machine-gun detachments have been
stationed. Military authorities here
and in other border encampments announced
that every preparation had
been made for possible hostilities.
After waiting forty-eight hours, the
border read news dispatches giving the
American version of the fight at Carrizal.
containing Gen. Pershing's report
that it was an unprovoked attack upon
the Americans and then lapsed into
expectant waiting.
When the dispatches were read to
Gen. George Bell, jr., commanding the
El Paso military district, over the telephone
early today, he expressed keen
gratification, but said that he had received
no additional orders from de
partmentai neaaquarters.
"I knew it." he exclaimed. "I knew
our men did not start that fight."
With the receipt of Gen. Pershing's
first report military authorities here
felt confident that supplemental reports
would be received today giving
additional details of the fight and news
of the two squadrons of the llth Cavalry
who were sent to reinforce the
troops of the 10th.
Troops Back in Juarez.
A few of the troops that evacuated
Juarez had returned today and there
were reports that the reoccupation of
the town by the entire former garrison
of 4.000 is contemplated. During the
early morning hours in the Mexican
town only a few scattering military
patrols were on the streets. Gen.
Francisco Gonzales, commandant, and
Andres Garcia, consul at El Paso, who
recently has been sleeping on the Mexican
side, rode through the streets on
horseback, apparently making an inspection
tour.
Indications that all preparations have
neen mane in tne event a nasty departure
of the remnant of the garrison
Is deemed expedient were to be foui\d
in the railway yards, where two troop
trains with steam up stood ready for
instant departure.
Reports current in Mexican circles
that Gen. Alvara Obregon, Mexican
minister of war, has issued a manifesto
offering to accept the services of all
rebel leaders in the event of hostilities
with the United States, found some
confirmation "in the fact that today a
number of Mexicans who had been exiled
for political reasons crossed into
Juarez.
All of these, including Gen. Marcelo
Caraveo, former adherent of Orozco and
Huerta, and other former minor factional
leaders, seemingly were in good
favor with the Mexican military authorities.
It was said that Gen. Caraveo

KILLING 1878 ACT=
TO BENEFIT CITY
Half-and-Half Law is Pronounced
Wise, Beneficent
and Fair. Why Destroy It?
GO FURTHER, FARE WORSE;
LET WELL ENOUGH ALONE
No One Who Wishes Something Better
for the Capital Should Vote
to Repeal Half-and-Half
Law at This Time and
in This Way.
Editorial Correspondence of The Star.
BY THEODOBE W. NjOYES.
There are many who wish to repeal
the half-and-half law only If they can
substitute something which they eonalder
better In ltd place.
Before the joint congressional committee
the single taxers conceded that
the destruction of the half-and-half
plan which they nought wfculd be disaatroua
to the small taxpayers and
would be undesirable unless the single
tax system was simultaneously adopted.
Many advocates of suffrage for the
District urged repeal of the half-andhalf
plan on the theory that It prevented
District representation on
American lines In national and municipal
government* and favored this repeal
only in order that such representation
might be enjoyed.
Friends of the District like ex-Senator
Blackburn favored repeal of the
half-and-half law only In order that
the nation might contribute much more
than half tcfward capital upbuilding.
His testimony before the joint fiscal
committee shows that ex-Senator
Blackburn thought that the half-andhalf
arrangement is now inequitable
toward the Washington taxpayers;
that if a definite proportionate contribution
plan were continued the payment
of 65 per cent by the nation and
of 3T> per cent by the local community
would more nearly meet the equltlea,
and that he favored a system in aubatltution
for the half-and-half plan
which, while it should not limit the nation
to a half contribution, should be aa
definite in ita protection of the local
community ngninat unjuat and exeesalve
taxation aa the half-and-half law
itaelf.
The repeal of the half-and-half law
aa now promoted doea not meet any of
the conditions of the approval of auch

dlcated. There is no prospect and no
expectation of the Immediate establishment
of the single tax Nyitem in
Itx entirety In Washington. Such xystem
will he the more^eaxily extablixhed
If it la required to exact from the community
a half inxtead of the whole of
the burden of maintaining- and developing
the National Capital. Much men
ax Keprexentativex Croxxer and Bailey,
for example, xhould be with ux on the
immediate ixxue.
The repeal now propooed doex not inereaxe

American reprexentatlon of the resldenta
of the District In either national
or municipal government. It carriex no
promlxe of and haa no tendency to
bring about auch Increased reprexentatlon.
While this repealing rider is
pushed vigorously, our enfranchising
constitutional amendment, which should
accompany it. is shelved in committee.
Repeal of the half-and-half^ law. as
now proposed* instead of enlarging diminishes
the national sense of obligation

The Indefinite Contribution Plan. ?
I An almost unbearable burden of re- E
. sponsibility rests upon those Influential
, friends of Washington, in Congress b
and Out, who, in order to benefit the v
: j District, join hands with those who a
j would repeal the half-and-half law only
: to punish and to hurt the local taxpayers. I
, j For many months men prejudiced by
. I erroneous beliefs who think that the I
nation is ufider little or no obligation
to contribute toward capital maintenance
have openly assaulted or in- r|
sidiously undermined the half-and-half t)
law and its basic principle o'f definite h
J proportionate contribution by the na- t(
tion toward the upbuilding of the na- g.
tion's city. As representatives they
have denounced the expenditure of a tj
cent of the money contributed in part
by their constituents to relieve the u
shameless mendicants of the federal u
District. They have bitterly assailed c<
Washingtonians aB beggars of national tl
alms, masquerading as poor, while, in | c<
fact, the wealthiest per capita in tax-|_
j able resources of al\ Americans. They ~
| have contended that the full obligation
j of municipal maintenance and development
of the capital is upon the local
taxpaying community, and that the latter
is perfectly able, without a cent of
national contribution, to bear this burden
if fairly taxed. They have demanded
the repeal of the half-and-half
law as a fraud upon the nation. They
have sought to increase District taxation
50 per cent by one measure, and
100 per cent by others, and these legislative
propositions have with difficulty
been defeated in the last Congress?
in some cases only through non-concurrence
by the Senate. They openly
avow that they would tear away the
capital's financial shield and buckler?
the organic act of 1878?in order to diminish
or destroy national participation
in capital maintenance. They would by
double taxation compel the local community
to raise all of the revenue
needed. They would substitute for the
definite proportionate contribution of
one-half by the nation an undetermined,
indefinite contribution, reduced to nothing
or to a very little, and that little
to be given fluctua(ingly, capriciously,
spasmodically, from ^session to session,
as the spirit moves Congress. They
would deny or minimize into a molehill
the national obligation; they would
magnify into a mountain the local obligation.
Washington desperately resisted these
successive assaults upon the law which
, embodied recognition of the true rela,
tion of the nation to the capital, by
which for thirty-seven years both na(Continued

TWO GERMAN CRUISERS LOST.
Idmiralty Explains Why It Did Not
Tell of Lutzow and Bostock.
ROTTERDAM, via London, June 23.
-The Cour^.nt today in an article gives
/hat it says are the German adliralty's
reasons why it did not make
nown in its first report of the reent
battle off Jutland the loss of the
attle cruiser Lutzow and the light
ruiser Rostock, as follows:
"When the first report was sent out
?r two ships had not sunk, but were
eing towed, badly damaged, back to
Germany. Finally both sank after the
urvivors and wounded had been taken
ff. If the German admiralty had
tated in its first report that attempts
ewe $>eing made to save the ships,
Inglish destroyers would undoubtedly
ave been sent to try to sink them."
According to dispatches, the German
attleship Koe-nig, damaged in the naal
battle of May 31, has been docked

Immediate action on his resolution
i authorizing the President to draft into
the federal service national guardsmen
I willing to take the oath under the new
army law was asked in the House to- ,
jday by Chairman Hay of the military }
(committee. At the same time he of.
fered an amendment to declare that 1
the emergency for the draft now exists, J
instead of leaving the question to be

I determined oy me
The amendment changed the resolu- *
ition by the direct declaration that in
the opinion of the Congress of the '<
United States an emergency now exists <
which demands the use of troops in ad- | i
dition to the regular army of the <
United States, and that the President I
be. jind he is hereby authorized, to draft
the National Guard. The resolution
formerly read "that whenever in his P
opinion an emergency exists which de- P
mands the use of the troops in addition s
to the regular army of the United e
States, the President is authorized to ^
draft the National Guard."
Chairman Hay, drawn out by collo- f
quies with Republican Lead?r Mann f
and other members, announced to the h
House that the resolution does not con- ?
template a state of war. and that the
mere fact of the introduction of the J
resolution "handed to me by the War <
Department- shows that in the opinion ?
of the executive the emergency does i
exist, and that this resolution is abso- 1
lutely necessary to meet the emer- t
gency." i
Definite Step Necessary.
Representative Mann of Illinois insisted
that the time has arrived when t
a definite step must be taken in re- n
gard to Mexican affairs:
"The theory of the Hay-Chamberlain b
act," he said, "was to make the Na-.h
tional Guard our main reliance, and if n
we are to maintain the position we J r
have taken with regard to Mexico it is t
time to put that act into effect. If the b
National Guard is to be our main re- ^
liance we must call upon it now." t,
Representative Chiperfield or Illinois,
himself a national guardsman, said b
that in his opinion the Hay resolution 11
should be so amended as to make the 1
term of the service of national guards- 0
men in this emergency a matter of j1
definite limitations: *
"As it is now worded," he said, "the
President can say the emergency exists J1
for one? year or five years or forever, j {_
and theT""national guardsmen would | 11
have to stay in the ranks as long as i
that. By thiB resolution you are wip- |
ing out the militia of the United States, f
unless you give the national guards- q
men a definite term in the regular n
service." a

Representative Butler of Pennsyl- ?
vania, who reminded the House that c<

preceding the Spanish war and' could
remember perfectly the various steps
taken at that time, criticised the fact
that "the language of the Hay resolu- v,
tion makes the President the sole Judge
of this situation." ni
He continued: "The President may un- c<
derstand that an emergency exists, but <j,
how do we know it? How does Congress
know it? This resolution asks it
us to give the President the authority 0i
to decide the thing for himself. This si
may mean the destruction of life and tt
property, and it may mean war for T
years to come. So why doesn't the m
President make known to us the rea- ai
sons why he wants this resolution cl
adopted."
"A. piece of unbaked legislation" is it
what Representative Huddleston, a cl
democrat of Alabama, termed the Hay T
resolution. Representative Walsh of P
Massachusetts offered an amendment H
slightly changing the wording of the ai
Hay resolution, and said that the in
