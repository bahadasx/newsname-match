WASHINGTON, June 23,
Secretary Baker made public
today a report from General
Pershing on the fight at Car
rizal based on personal ques
j tionlng of men frrin the two
j troops of the Tenth cavalry
) engaged in the conflict. It
! indicated that the attacks up
on the Americans vas unpro
voked but gave' no estimate of
casualties on either side.
General Pershing had not
had an opportunity to confer
with any officer of the two
companies and Secretary Bak
er said that a definite con
clusion as to where the blame
i rested could not be formed.
1 The report, which was tak-
i en to the White House earl
ier in the day and afterward
I laid before the cabinet, told
l substantially the same story
carried In border press dis
patches last night. It said

permission to pass through
the town. Mexican guide
', returned with refusal from
General Gomez. Then
Gomez sent out note by or
derly saying that Boyd might
pass through the town, pro
vided he stopped for a con
ference. '"Then General Gomez
himself came out and discus
sed the situation 15 or 20
minutes with Boyd. Mean
time Mexican troops, moving
out from the town, began
surrounding Boyd's column.
Gomez retired, and when he
reached the right of his
troopB, Mexican troops began
firing machine guns. Boyd
then dismounted to fight on
foot.'
"General Pershing also re
I ports that he has sent out
l cavalry to support and bring
back the two troops In question."
'I NEW YORK, June 23. The
1 department of the east was
i notified by the war depart-
j ment today that as soon as
i national guards' organizations
under Its control are "reason
ably equipped for field serv
ice" they would be dispatched
to the border "without a mo
i ment'8 unreasonable delay."
WASHINGTON, June 23.
Secretary Baker today issued
orders to all army depart
mental commanders to send
to the Mexican border all
militia available Immediately
i upon their organization, with-
out waiting for completion of
the separate states.
, The commanders were re
quested to notify General
Funston when each regiment,
troop, battery or other unit
I completes muster. General
i 1 Funston will Indicate where
t.- he wishes the forces sent In
J ,! each Instance, and the dePart;

s Ij them forward.
COLUMBUS, N. M., June
I 23. An unofficial report has
I been received here that Mex-
1I leans orossed to the Amerl-
can aide near Hachlta early
m
today and ran off with a
number of horses and mules.
American troops, according to
another report, immediately
gave chase and crossed into
Mexico after them.
San Antonio, Texas, June 23. With
the number of U. S. soldiers reported
from Chihuahua to have been cap
tured and the number killed and
wounded, would account for practical
ly one troop, or fifty per cent of the
command. Indeed, from the reports
available so far, it Is by no means
certain that Captain Boyd's command
was not practically wiped out.
Large Patrols Sent Out.
Columbus, n! M , June 23. General
Pershing has sent out large scouting
patrols to locate wounded stragglers
of the ill-fated negro detail which en
countered Carraza troops at Carrizal,
Wednesday, it was learned here today.
To date seven horse holders of the
cavalry detachment are known to
have returned to their base. Fear is
p-v-nressed in some nuarters that the
gravity of the American losses may
have been greater than reported from
Mexican sources. It is pointed out
thai, bereft of their mounts, the re
treating Americans might have been
chased by Mexican cavalry and furth
er attacked.
Mexican Embassy Dispatches.
Washington, June 23. Mexican em
bassy dispatches today said news of
the fight at Carrizal was received in
Mexico City without demonstration
oL.any.-soEL
"Absolute quiet prevailed in the city
and 'from all outward appearances it
was impossible to discern that the na
tion was facing a serious situation,"
the message said. "There was marked
activity among both the civilian and
the military officials of the govern
ment." Americans Leaving Capital.
Advising the embassy of the depart
ure from Mexico City yesterday of the
special train carrying 150 Americans
for Vera Cruz, the report added:
"During the last ten days" the mes
sage said, "450 Americans from Mex
ico City and elsewhere have left and it
is not now believed by consular and
other officials that more than 250
Americans remain in the capital. None
of those remaining express any ap
prehension regarding their safety."
Awaiting Official Statement.
Washington, June 23. A prelimin
ary report from General PerBhlng on
the Carrizal fight, based on stores told
by stragglers reaching the headquar
ters of the American expedition and
on Mexican rumors, was taken to the
White House today by Secretary Bak
er. The secretary said General Pershing
himself did not regard the report as
an official statement of what happen
ed and indicated that no attempt to
decide the course to be pursued by
the United States would be made until
a complete account had been receiv
ed. Officials Are Worried.
-rf;toic? n-ra worried ovfir the delav
in getting news from the surviving
officers of the little Tenth cavalry
detachment which engaged a superior
force of Mexicans.
General Pershing said he hoped to
have a report -from surviving officers
by courier during the day.
Secretary Baker denied rumors of
plans for an immediate call for volun
teers to add to the regular and na
tional guard force. Ho also said theie
had been no additional orders over
night for troop movements.
Senate Seeks Information.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, called at
the state department early today, seek
ing Information. He aaid congress
would do nothing that might interfere
with negotiations of the state depart
ment. Army Men's View.
San Antonio, Texas, June 23. Com
bining various stories, army men be
lieved that Captain Boyd, after he dis
mounted and deployed hiB men, had
been forced to fall back to escape the
cross fire of the Mexicans who virtu
ally had surrounded him under cover
of a parley. It is believed that thoso
captured may have been cut off from
the main body by an overwhelming
force and forced to surrender.
The fact that men detailed to hold
the horses reached General Pershing's
column also is believed to account In
a measure for the heavy casualties.
The command was without wagons or
other means of transporting the
wounded and the loss of the horses
may have been a serious factor in de
laying a retreat.
Confidence in Boyd.
Captain Boyd's previous record is
one thing which has influenced army
men to place confidence in the report
of the stragglers so far as it relates to
the opening of the engagement. He
is regarded as one of the most effi
cient and careful officers of the army
'and a stickler for obeying orders to
the letter
Tokio, Japan, June 23. "Of course
any claim that the Japanese govern
ment will assist Mexicans with muni
tions and arms is out of the question
and absurd" said Baron Ishil, foreign
minister, to a correspondent of The
Associated Press who asked him today
for his views on the Mexican situation
The interview was sought on account
of declarations attributed to Mexicans
that assurances had been received
from Japan that munitions and other
assistance would be given to Mexico
in event of war with the United
States.
Japan Furnishing Allies.
"As for private Japanese companies
selling arms to Mexicans," the for
eign minister continued, "I consider
it extremely improbable. As you know
all available rifles and guns are be
ing furnished to Japan's allies to as
sist in bringing the European war to
a successful issue And I fancy,
though I do not know, that munitions,
not available for our allies, may have
found their way to China during the
revolutionary troubles
"Let me say tills with all the em
phasis and earnestness at my com
mand," said the minister swinging
around in his chair. "The Japanese
nation sincerely hopes that armed
conflict between the United States
and Mexico may be avoided. Japan's
interest in America, North, Central
nnH Smith beine essentially pacific
and commercial, any event bringing
disturbances into the American mar
ket would be felt keenly In Japan.
This Is especially true at a moment
when the whole European trade is
virtually closed to Japan and the
Chinese" market Is seriously upset"
Never Heard of General Iturbe.
Baron Ishii declared he had never
heard of General Ramon Iturbe, a re
presentative of General Garrauza who
was reported several weeks ago to be
on his way to Japan on a secret mis
sion. .
Japan's interest in Mexico, he said,
was in charge of Secretary Ohta, form
erly attached to the Japanese embas
sv at Washington. He said he had
received no advices from Secretary
Ohta in regard to the present situa
tion. Colonel Manuel Romero, re
cently appointed minister to Japan by
General Carranza, has reached this
country, but has not had an audience
with the emperor.
Five Thousand Missouri Troop6.
Nevada, Mo., June 23. Mobilization
of the Missouri National Guard prac
tically was completed here today with
the arrival of a battery and a troop
of cavalry from St. Louts. Additional
infantry companies being recruited
may swell the total Missouri troops
above five thousand.
The mustering of the troops into the
federal service which was begun to
day, will, it was believed, require at
least a week.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, Juno 23.
Criticism of American military men
who, he said, have caused all the
trouble between Mexico and the Unit
ed States, was made by General Tre
vino, military commander of the north
east, In an Interview with the Asso
ciated Press today.
General Trevlno said that General
Hugh Scott was evidently wrong when
he told the Mexican conferees at the
meeting in El Paso that the American
military men, least of all factors In
the. United States wished to fight
against Mexico.
irrMi A marlnnn mllltslTV VinS dlK-
obeyed the orders of its own chiefs,
has never respected the feelings or
the property of Mexican citizens, and
has contemptuously Ignored the dis
positions of the Mexican government,"
declared the general.
"I do not want war," added General
Trevlno, "arfd I am doing my utmost
to control the situation, but, If war
Is forced on the Mexican nation by
the Americans, I am both ready and
willing to do my duty, like every other
faithful sou, to uphold the honor and
dignity of my country."
Officers arriving hero today with the
body of General Felix Gomez, who was
killed in the Carrizal engagement,
said that the American leaders evi
dently had instructed their men to
concentrate their fire on the general
who, on account of his great bulk,
was an easy target. They said General
Gomez was the first Mexican to fall
with three bullets in his chest.
From Colonel Zuazua at Namlqulpa
comes the report that the Namlqulpa
base has practically been abandoned
and the Americans have been given
the ranchers more than 200 rifles that
were taken from the VilHstas.
General Trevlno is still treating
with Contreras. Hernandez and other
Villa leaders to come in and help ex
pel the Invaders.
All towns in northern Mexico have
asked for arms, offering to equip from
500 to 2000 in each town to help the
government.

Chairman Hay Offers Amend
ment Declaring Emergency
for Mustering in of
Guards Now Exists.
Washington, June 23. In an
amendment to the Hay resolution
authorizing the president to draft
Into the federal service" Immedi
ately all national guardsmen will
ing to take the cath, the house to
day unanimously declared that an
emergency now existed, necessi
tating a call on state troops.
Questioned by Republican Lead
er Mann and others, Mr. Hay told
the house that the resolution did
not contemplate a state of war,
but that the mere fact of the in
troduction handed to him by the
war department "shows that in
the executive the emergency does
exist and that this resolution Is
absolutely necessary to meet the
emergency."
Washington, June 23. Immediate
action on his resolution authorizing
the president to draft into the federal
service national guardsmen willing
to lake the oath under the new army
law, was asked In the house today by
Chairman Hay of the military com
mittee. At the same time he offered
an amendment to declare that the
emergency for the draft now exists In
stead of leaving the question to be
determined by the president.
An amendment by Representative
Chlperfleld of Illnois, providing that
when the national guardsmen were
discharged after the emergency
ceases they shall resume their former
National Guard organization status,
was adopted without objection.
One agreed upon by Representa
tives Mann and Hay provided that
the National Guard drafted should
serve for the period of the emer
gency, "not exceeding three years,"
unless sooner discharged.
Unanimous consent for considera
tion of the resolution was given and
general donate began under an agree
ment for a two hour limit.
Representative Mann made a speech
declaring that a state of war with
Mexico already existed to all Intents
and purposes and expressing the opin
ion that the regular troops were not
carrying out the purpose for which
they were sent Into Mexico. He said,
however, that he did not sec how
they could bo withdrawn ujider the
present situation and if they were to
stay the military strength of the coun
try necessarily must be increased.
Representative Butler of Pennsyl
vania, Republican, urged that the pres
ident should advise congress of his
reasons for determining that an emer
gency existed.
"I think we are declaring war here,"
declared Representative Madden of
Illinois.
Mr. Hay replied that the president
would be required to come back to
congress if a declaration of war was
deemed necessary. "This resolution
doos not contemplate a declaration of
war or a declaration that a state of
war exists," he added.

"In the Champagne district yester
day evening following a bombardment
of our positions between Maisons de
Champagne and Mont Tetu, the Ger
mans delivered three attacks upon our
trenches along a front of about 1200
yards.
German Attacks Checked.
"Each of these attacks was either
checked by our curtain of ifire or re
pulsed with hand grenades. Groups
of the enemy which penetrated one
of our advanced positions west of
Mont Tetu were immediately expelled
at the point of the bayonet. Ten
prisoners were taken by us. During
the night, several surprise attacks
against small French posts northeast
of Butte de Mesnil were repulsed.
"On the left bank of the Meuse the
Germans have renewed their efforts
in the region of Hill No. 304. Two at
tacks with hand grenades were check
ed by the fire of our machine guns.
"On the right bank of the river there
was considerable activity on the part
of the artillery along our entire front
from the Meuse as far as Molainville.
This was particularly noticeable in
the region west and south of Fort
Vaux. Here the enemy used to a con
siderable extent shells which produced
a gas irritating to the eyes.
"At Eparges a minor German attack
resulted in complete failure."

Austrian Army Facing Destruction.
London, Juno 22, 11:20 a- m The
official announcement by the Russian
war office of the capture of Radautz,
a city of 13,000 inhabitants, situated
30 miles south of Czcrnowitz and ton
miles from the Russian frontier,
shows how actively General Lat
chitzky is pursuing the broken Aus
trian forces. According to a special
dispatch from Petrograd, nothing but
a miracle can avert the destruction
of General Pflanzer's army as Gen
eral Letchitzky now holds a stretch
of 20 miles on the South river.
According to a report from Rome,
an Austrian army under General
Baltin is shut up in the angle of the
frontier near the town of Sereth, com
pletely surrounded by Russians. The
Austrian official communication re
ceived here tonight, claims -that the
Austrlans have repulsed Russian at
tacks near Gura Humora, This town
is in the extremo south of Bukowina
on the Meldava river, 54 miles south
of Czornowltz. Thus, unless some
other town of the same name Is meant,
the Russian pursuit seemingly has ex
tended much farther than the Rus
sians claim.

STATE RESTS IN
ORPET TRIAL
Letters Written by Youth to
Former Sweetheart Are
Read in Court.
Waukegah, 111., June 23. The state
rested its case against Will H. Orpet,
charged with the murder of his former
sweetheart, Marion Lambert, today,
after several more letters the youth
wrote to the girl had been read.
November and December Letters.
Late In November he writes that he
hopes she "got the stuff" all right.
December 7 he wrote "letter received
this morning and was surprised to
hear that there was nothing doing yet.
Don't see the doctor until I have given
somethlug to take."
He wrote to Josephine Davis Janu
ary 21, "I don't know what to think
of Marion being so sick. Write and
tell me everything." The next day he
sent a letter to Marion, care of Jose
phine. "Joe has told me you have been
pretty sick," he wrote to Marion.
"Will try to go down' to see you
February 9. Will call you up evening
of February 9. Remember the dates.
It will be under the same conditions.
Remember. If all Is not all right it
will be when I see you. Don't tell
anyone about Vhe 8th for I am not
supposed to come home then."
..
audi Letters.
The next letter was one of the so
called alibi letters, post-dated Febru
ary 9 til, at Madison, and mailed, it is
alleged, by a friend while Orpet was
at Lake Forest. In it the writer spoke
In commonplace terms of school
work.
"There is no compulsion about ans
wering this letter," he "continued. "In
fact I don't expect a reply. But you
never can tell."
The last of the letter's -introduced by
the state was one from Marion to Miss
Rumsey, her Sunday school teacher.
It was written February S, the night
before her death, and was found on
her body on the tenth. It 'says:
"Your note came yesterday and I
want to thank you more sincerely than
you can imagine for it. I am very
glad that you think that there is a
possibility of my 'amounting to much'
atter all. I was very much afraid that
you thought that I was silly on ac
count of what is termed my giggles.
At first I just giggled because I
thought life was nothing but a joke
and felt no responsibility. But lately
it has been because I really wasn't
happy so I tried to disguise my feel
ing that way.
"You may think it queer for one to
laugh when they really want to cry,
but I am rather queer anyway. But
now I feel much better and I slu
cerely want to be someone that will
do a little good anyway. I have tried
that W. G. C. (Westminster Guild
Club) plan. T feel that it is succeed
ing fairly well. It helps mo In many
other things, too. I thank
you once more for your good wishes.
With love, Marlon."
"P. S. I just learned about W. G.
C. meeting next Saturday, today. I
will be there and try to bring somo
of the ones that don't come very of
ten, if possible."
Orpet Letters Are Read.

Orp.et's letters to Marion.
"Keep yourself for mo" he wrote on
May 16, 1915. The next day he com
plained "the only way I could get
through my classes today was by
thinking there would be a letter from
vou but there was none. There is no
tun In anything without you. Try o
love mo, for that means more to me
than anything In the world."
This letter, like the others, was
written from Madison, Wis., where
Orpet was attending the University
of v Wisconsin.
On the 2Sth ho acknowledged re
ceipt of a letter from Marion. "I
couldn't tell from your letter whether
you are for mo or not. What have I
done, or failed to do?" he asked.
"Don't write that way. If you lovo
me, loosen up,"
On June 2 he expressed happiness
at a "good" letter from Marlon. "Only
about ten days and I shall see you and
kiss you very much. I am glad you
are still good. Keep it up and when
I get home we'll take the lid off."
By November 3, after the summer
vacation, Orpet addressed her merely
as "Dear Marion" and spoko of see
ing her on Thanksgiving. "But I sup
poBo you don't care," he wrote.
In this and subsequent letters he
had stopped pleading with Marion for
warmer expressions of her regard.
