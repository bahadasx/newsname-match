Council Places No Re
strictions on City
Engineer
City Engineer L. D. Kelsey, by or
dinance passed Wednesday night by
tlie city council, was given complete
charge of the building and buying of
supplieb iof the Wishkah water sy
stem. The council, in the measure
introduce 1 by Councilman J. M. Bowes
made go-xl on ltd promise of last
week that there should be no strings
placed on the city engineer in his |
handling of the big job. 1
Tonight the mayor, city engineer
and council will attend a meeting of
the Aberdeen Trades Council, by in-'
vitation of that body through Secre
tary V. T. Evans, at which the build
ing of the Wishkah water project will
be discussed. |
What looks like a tangle in freight'
accounts was started Wednesday
night by the 0.-W.'s presenting a'bill
for some $600, representing an addi
tional freight charge on material for j
the water system figured at 60 cents
a hundred weight instead of 40 cents,
as charged in the original bill. The
40 cent rate had been made in error
by the railway company. The matter
was referred to the city attorney. i
The city treasurer was ordered to
bill the Bay City Lumber company
for $300, amounts that Water Super
intendent George Bowen explained he,
had found the lumber company had
owed from three to six years. $234 be
ing for water used in the company's
barns; $36 for water for the offices, |
and $30 for water piped into a big
tank, in violation of the water ordi-1
nance. The treasurer also was in
structed to return to S. Eiche, 1004
East First street, $1.25 water rent'
at that address paid in advance, wa
ter having been ordered shut off by
Eiche without his having used it.
"Upon the city engineer's report that
most of the West Second street prop
erty owners favor concrete for that
thoroughfare's paving, Councilmen
John Eraser and Anton Pista urged
that the city do the work. Council
man J. D. Walker objected that the j
city engineer would be busy enough |
with the Wishkah project without hav- j
ing another city job put on his
shoulders. The matter was referred a
week. j
The offer was accepted of the
Kelly Bros. Wood company, to re
'"Twild three blocks of Curtis street |
( Wood paving and to maintain it, if
"thi > city would supply the nails. Beso-:
lutions were ordered drawn, at Coun
cilman E. C. McKnight's request, pro
\ iding for the paving of Perry street |
f.nd of a stretch on Curtis street. |
An ordinance amending the flre
vorks ordinance, prohibiting use of,
'Skyrockets and confetti on streets and
-alleys, was passed, and the chief of |
police was instructed to see that j
stores do not sell these articles to
Splash celebrants. j

KAFFIR BOY CHOIR
COMES TO HARBOR
WITH CHAUTAUQUA
Will Give Big Program
on Closing Night of
Course
Of the many numbers to come with
the Chautauqua to Grays Harbor this
season probably no one attraction has
excited so much enthusiasm and in
terest as the Kaffir boy choir. It is
not the kind of attraction that one
would expect to see and hear most
any place and it is not strange that
folks have been directing a score of
questions at the Chautauqua commit
tee in an attempt to find out just what
these interesting little fellows will do
on the closing night of the Chautauqua.
In the first place, they are real
Kaffirs. They were brought to Amer
ica from Africa by J. H. Balmer, a
man who has spent over thirty years
of his life among these people. In
the short time the Kaffir boys have
been away from Africa they have
appeared before hundreds of thou
sands of people in America and have
been given great ovations from one
end of the land to the other. They
sing songs, both native and English
—and they sing the English songs re
markably well for Kaffirs. They are
unable to speak in English and have
memorized after many months of
studying the songs they do sing in our
tongue. They give war songs and na
tive love songs and carry with them
many trophies of Kaffir battles, in
cluding hides and pelts of many native
animals.
They will give an entire evening pro
gram on the closing night of the Chau
tauqua and several have ventured to
suggest that the big brown tent will
be more than crowded to capacity on
the Kaffir boy choir night of the big
week.

fair sample of many odd stunts that
feature the Splash.
The preparedness parade on the
Fourth, and children's and auto pa
rades on third and fifth, respectively,
with the floral parade and Rose show
on the third, too, make up an attract
ive program. In addition, on every
day will be the "Skidroad" on Wishkah
street, with something doing every
minute.
Not Responsible for Debts
The Moose committee in charge of
the Splash announces, as a measure
of precaution, that it will not be re
sponsible for any debts contracted by
any carnival company.
Rev. T. H. Simpson, chairman of
the children's day parade, July 3,
wants every person taking part ift
that and the floral march to come
with a flag, to wave, to show their
patriotism.
Major O. R. Austin has succeeded
Capt. A. H. Comeau a3 chairman of
the Splash preparedness parade, Co
meau resigning to go to American
Lake with his command.
STRAWBERRY CROP LATE.
The strawberry crop of Grays Har
bor county is late and li - lit and high
prices for the local berry will rule.

ward H. Davis of Pasco will speak.
Mrs. W. Y. Croxall will have charge

department are in Seattle attending

and 5 deaths in Hoquiam and vi

Police Find Four
Cases of Whisky
Labeled as Beer
Sixty-Four Bottles in "Packages Ship
ped on Beer Permit from
California
The police, last Wednesday, ran
down four cases of whisky, labelled
as beer and shipped to Aberdeen from
Oakland, Gal. The whisky was sent
to J. L. Wiley, Mrs. Martha Wiley,
Mrs. Rose Allen and Mrs. B. N. Car
neron, all residing on I street between
Heron and Hume. There were 64
bottles, each containing nearly a quart
in the four packages, and on each
package was affixed a beer permit.
The consignees, when the packages
were opened by Patrolman C. N.
Baker in their presence, declined to
accept them, claiming they knew noth
ing about the reasons for the sub
stitution. City Attorney A. E. Cross
is looking into the legal questions in
volved in what may prove to have
been a deliberately planned evasion
of the dry law provisions.
THIRSTY TOO OFTEN
James Barton of this city and James
i Walker, Carlisle logger, were arrest
ed Wednesday by Sheriff Schelle
Mathews on charges that they had
obtained permits for liquor shipments
oftener than once in 20 days. Walk
er says he thought the dry law pro
vided a permit every 12 days. This
is the first arrest of the kind In Grays
Harbor county. With the county aud
itor issuing 200 and more permits a
day, it would be difficult to check
every applicant at the time of appli
cation; but the check, afterwards, is
absolute.
Jury Disagrees
The jury disagreed, Wednesday, in
the trial of Askel E'rlckson, steward
of the steamer Coronado, on a charge
of bootlegging. Jurors who stood for
acquittal held that, while likely a tech
nical violation of the dry law had
been committed, yet Erickson had a
right to have whiskey on the Coronado
for use on the high seas, and that
the Washington state law could not
compel its destruction upon coming
into port here.
SUPREME LODGE
OF K. P. IN AUGUST
Portland Will Entertain
Knights With Many
Features
Some of the things that will be en
joyed by Knights of Pythias who go
to Portland August 1 to 10, when the
supreme lodge of the order holds its
biennial session will be: A trip over
the famous Columbia river highway;
trip through the Columbia gorge by
boat; salmon dinner out of doors;
clam bake on the ocean beach; su
preme chancellor's ball; night at The
Oaks, with pyrotechnic display; coun
cil fire on Council Crest; the greatest
parade ever made by one fraternity on
the Pacific coast; two public recep
tions; surf bathing at the beach, and
auto trips through the most magnifi
cent scenery in America.
Portland is sparing no expense to
make this the most memorable session
in the history of the Order of Knights
of Pythias. It is the first time the
highest division of the fraternity has
ever come to the Northwest, and it is
the time of all times for all sections
of the district to make an impression
that will produce development later.
In many sections of the Northwest
local lodges are preparing to attend
in a body. It will be a vacation for
many people in one of the most charm
ing cities of America and where hos
pitality is always on tap.
FIVE FIRES IN ONE DAY.
Last Saturday the Aberdeen Are de
partment answered five calls, the dam
age being slight in each case.
COMPANY G TO
START SUNDAY
ON STERN WORK
Local Militia Organiza
tion Off for Ameri
can Lake
SENT TO MOBILIZE
Jobs of Guardsmen Will
Be Kept Open for
Them Here
The trouble with Mexico, which at
present writing looks like impending
war, was brought home to Aberdeen
as to most communities in the United
States when orders were received by
Capt. H. A. Comeau, Co. G, 2nd Reg.,
N. G. W., to take his command to
American lake next Sunday morning
to join the mobilization camp of the
state militia.
Captain Comeau and the other of
ficers of the local militia organization
immediately busied themselves in
starting a campaign to recruit Com
pany G to war strength, 142 men.
This, it is likely, will have been eft
fected by tomorrow night. The meiT
will depart for Am**— , ake at 8;30
o'clock g'jitday morning. -4
While border patrol probably wili b£
the most strenuous duty which the
militia of the country will be com
pelled to face, there are possibilities
of its being sent into Mexico. In any
event, the willingness shown by mill
owners, logging camps and other em
ployers of labor to keep the jobs open
for guardsmen while they are upon
duty Is to be commended.
Merchants Will 1 ,
Picnic at Offut
Lake on July 27
Committee Appointed and Will Meet
Next Week to Start Prepara
tions for Event
Merchants of Grays Harbor will
hold their annual picnic this year at
Offut Lake, Thursday, July 27. Last
year it was held at Electric park,
and was a successful affair. This
year's entertainment, according to
present plans, is to be just as good
as last year's. The committee in
charge of the picnic, which will meet
next week to start arrangements for
it, is composed of J. Y. Martin, chair
man; J. W. Huff, W. H. McKnight,
W. G. Powell, E. A. Newton, of Ab
erdeen; P. L. Tullus, F. A. Cook, A.
V. LeClerc. Jas. Warnken and N.

STRIKE HURTING
LUMBER EXPORTS
No Chance Apparent for
Breaking Deadlock
Very Soon
I Lumber exports from Grays Harbor
will suffer this month from the long
shoremen's strike. It is likely they
will be smaller than in any of the
months during the dullest times the
Harbor has experienced in recent
years.
There is no chance of the deadlock
existing in the strike situation break
ing before next week. Hopes of the
employers do not run high for any
thing to occur then. On Monday there
will be a resumption of conferences
in California between the longshore
men and waterfront employers. Own
ers are standing pat; strikers say
they have nothing to concede, in the
meantime.
LADY MACCABEES ENTERTAIN.
On Monday evening the Lady Mac
cabees of the World will give a pro
gram to the public at Moose hall.
About 25 young people will take part
in pantomimes and musical numbers.
HOQUIAM KNIGHTS WIN.
Kniglis of Pythias of Hoquiam beat
Aberdeen Knights last Monday night
In a contest between degree teams.
G. A. R. CLUB MEETS TODAY.
The G. A. R. club will meet this
afternoon with Mrs. C. C. Hopkins,
