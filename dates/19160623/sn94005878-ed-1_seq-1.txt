nounied epoch-making in American
historv bv Senator (lllie M. James ol
Kentucky In his adJrc& as perma

national contention.
"During three years of Its national
control." -ald Senator .lames, "Democ

gressive remedial legislation than t tic
nation has ever had written upon it:
statute books since Its birth. In for

decades, our party came as a prophet
Today we come with deeds, not

the legislativo record of the admlnis

for his direction of foreign affairs
The Democrats, he said, hail enacted

were curbed, ami unexampled pros

He declared President Wilsons
Mexican policy, and his course in pro
tecting American rights against the
encroachments of Kuropean belliger

President "neither bullies the weak
nor fears the strong."
In a concluding appeal for the trl
timph of patriotism; above politics
Senator James said the renoniination
l such a President in partisan con

that to discredit him might palsy the
hand that could write the peace treaty

And without orphaning ft single
American child, without widowing a
single American mother, without fir

most militant spirit that ever brood

agreement to American demands. He
has elevated himself to that lofty but
lowly eminence occupied by (eorge

Woodrow Wilson. Hip three worst-
abused und best-loved Americans the
