TROUT SCREENS
Tests of Various Devices Are to Be
in the Near Future
Washington, Jane "23.—Tests of var
u, ious devices to prevent ti^h entering
irrigation ditohes are to be made by
forestry officials, who say that
thousands of troat placed in western
streams by the government are killed
by being washed out on the fields,
•si There are no less than 1,200 irrigation
projects on or near the national
forests, and in many places the loss of
trout is very heavy. The amount of
water used in irrigation, it Is said,
often determines the advisability of
artificially stocking the streams.
Made
The government annually plants
millions of flsh fry in the streams of
the national forests. Last year over
1,100,000 were planted iu Colorado and
Wyoming alone. Where much of the
water ie need for irrigation, unless the
ditohes are screened, the trout enter
them
acd are washed out on to the
fields. While flsh are said to make
good fertilizer, officials think thai,
troat are two expensive to be used for
that purpose.
Most of the western states have laws
requiring that the ditches be screened,
bat they are seldom enforced. The
farmers are said to dislike the screens,
because they collect, drift, wood and
trasb, which prevents the free flow of
the water.
A number of devices for screening
ditches are in use, and while two or
three have been found to be fairly ef
fective most of them are said to un
satisfactory. It is asserted that this
subject presents an excellent oppor
tunity for inventors, since a sucoese
'fc fal soreen will be sure to be widely
,«_nsed. Under present conditions of
^"floers are 6low to recommend the plac
id ing of trout in streams where they are
apt to be led off into the irrigation
ditohes.

'p VVi.tihuut doubt one of the greatest
.ever.thrown unun the mommmii.! uotcq nxfl John
shown at the Morris Grand theatre on
Wednesday evening yesterday after
noon and last evening to big houses on
each occasion. In the opinion of
many it is even better than "The Birth
of a Nation" shown here some time
ago.
The pioture oomiug at this time
when it seems that the United States
ii on the eve of a war with Mexico
carries a great lesson to the people of
this country. It is a pioture every
true American should see as it shows
how unprepared this oountry is for
war. Each thought brought out upon
the soreen is backed up by statistics
showing everything in its true light.
The soreen story i? taken from the
well known book of Hudson Maxim,
oue of the best authorities on modern
warfare in the world.
NAVAL ENGAGEMENT.
Manager Parks is to be congratulat
ed on securing this flue pioture for not
alone did it teach a great lesson but
the entertainnieut feature embraced in
the story was fine. Hummel's orchestra
furnished the music and it. was ex
