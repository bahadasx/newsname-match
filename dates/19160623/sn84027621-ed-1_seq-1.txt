STORM STRUCK THE CITY
Wrath Visited on Ocala by Outburst
of Wind and Rain ,(
The terrific, rain, hail and wind
storm which broke over the city about
12:30 this afternoon did considerable
damage, , tearing telephone, telegraph1
and electric wires fronf'their fasten
ings, ripping off shutters and blowing
over large trees. So far as can be
learned there has been no loss of life,
however, although there wast least
one narrow , escape. .
The large tree on the north side of
Broadway next to the Collier block
was - blown over, ripping up the
cement sidewalk, ' and tearing out
some wires across the street. A few
minutes before the tree fell City Cler);
Henry Sistrunk's car was parked just
where it would have got the full blow
of the crashing branches. Mr. , Sis
trunk and Miss Helen Scott had hes
itated about leaving the city hall in
the downpour, but decided that they
would risk it and drove off in the car
just before the tree fell.
During the storm Mr. A. E. Gerig's
news shop was flooded from a drain
pipe. The scuttle on the roof of. the
Merchant's building was ripped off by
the wind, and as a result the rain
poured in, flooding the floor directly
under it, some of the water leaking
down into the kitchen of Dewey's
cafe. ' . - .
. A short circuit caused by a wire
blown against a tree put the electric
lights out of commission for a few
minutes at 2 o'clock.

under Captain Boyd, fought its way
successfully through the J ring of Mex
ican troops which almost surrounded
it' at Carrizal Wednesday is still un
known at General Funston's . head
quarters. Nothing was heard from
Gen. Pershing today.
STORY OF THE STRAGGLERS
San Antonio, June 23. A few
stragglers who have reached Gen.
Pershing's headquarters give the fol
lowing report 'of the Carranza fight:
Two troops of the Tenth cavalry,
Company C, commanded by Captain
Charles T. Boyd, and Company K,
commanded by ( Captain Lewis , 8.
Moorey, comprised ' the detachment
that advanced within a mile of Car
rizal at 7 a. m., June 21. They had
J stopped at O ja de Santo Domingo, on
the . previous night, resuming their
march towards the east at 4 o'clock
next morning. .
' From their position in front of aCr
rizal the commander of the detach
ment, believed by General Pershing
to have been Captain Boyd, since he
was senior in rank to Captain Moorey,
sent forward a Mexican guide to get
from the commander of the Mexican
garrison there permission to pass thru
the town.
General Felix Gomex sent back
word by the guide that the Americans
might pass through if they would con
sent to a parley. Without waiting
for the commander of the American
force to reply, General Gomez, acom
paniedby an aide, appeared and the
American office rrode forward to talk
with him.
While they were talking, the men
told General Pershing, the Mexican
troops moved forward in force and
j
: aepioyea
in such manner that there
danger of the American
.
,appearea
force being surrounded. One of the
men said the American officer appear
ed to protest against the positions
General Gomez's troops were taking.
A-few minutes later General Gomez
rode toward one end of the Mexican
line and immediately after he got
there the Mexicans began the attack,
sweeping the American -line with a
machine gun.
It was not until then, according to
the stragglers, that the American
commander gave orders for both
troops to dismount and return the
fire.

cans then withdrew when heavy Mex
ican reinforcements were brought up.
It has beeni learned that a courier
from the battlefield reached General
Pershing's base at Colonia-Dublan

is expected shortly.

Chihuahua City, June 23. Seven
teen negro troopers of Troop H, Tenth
cavalry, who were captured at the
fight at Carrizal, were brought here '
yesterday, with Lem H. Spillsbury,' a
Mormon scout who was employed by
General Pershing, and were interned.
CAPT. BOYD KILLED
T .
. . '
Spillsbury said that Captain Chas.
T. Boyd, who commanded the Ameri
cans, and Lieutenant Henry R. Adair
were among the killed, and that a
captain named Moore, who was with ;
the American detachment, was
wounded in the shoulder but escaped.
In announcing the story of the bat
tle Spillsbury said it was told him
that General Trevino, the commander
of the Carranza army of the north,
declared that at any time and at any
place American troops moved other
than toward the border he will comply
with Carranza's order and attack
them as General Gomez did. He said
diplomatic arrangements were outside,
of his sphere.
Spillsbury said that Captains Boyd "'
and Moore and Lieutenant Adair and
himself and seventy-six negroes .of
Troop H, Tenth cavalry, comprised
the American detachment and that he .
saw the bodies of Boyd and Adair and '
at least eleven negroes on the field.
Trevino quotes Spillsbury as say
ing that Captain Boyd ordered his
men to advance on the theory that
General Gomez was bluffing; that the
American officers were hit at the first '
volley and that the negroes with their
mounts fled, leaving seventeen afoot,
who surrendered.
HEMMING PERSHING IN
El Paso, June 23. Juarez was
practically evacuated last night by
Carranza troops.
