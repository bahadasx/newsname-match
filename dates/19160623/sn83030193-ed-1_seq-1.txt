authorizing the President to draft Into the Fedoral service Immediately all
Jsatlounl Guardsmen willing to take the oath tbo Houso to-day unanimously
declared that an emergency now oxlstcd necessitating a call on State troops.
An amendment Iby Walsh shifting responsibility to President Wilson for
calling the militia was defeated (by a voto of 122 to 24.
Hay asked that tho language of tho
bill empowering the President to draft

'That in tho opinion of Congress,
the United States, whereas an em
ergency now exists which demands
the use of troops in addition to tho
Tegular army, the President be und

Uponsihlllty of declaring that an cm

"I am authorized," replied Hay, "to

tiecessary to command the service of
the militia."

Each Unit to Go Direct to
Front When Equipped
Will Bring Out 100,000.
WASHINGTON, June 23. Secretary
Baker to-day Issued orders to every
dopartmont commander to send his
mllltla forces to the border as rapidly
as he can equip them.
The commanders were requested to
notify Gen. Funston when each regl
ment, troop, battery or other unit
completes muster, Oen. Funston will
Indicate whero ho wishes tho forces
sent In each instance, and tho de
partmental commander, without fur
ther Instructions from Washington,
will arrange transportation and aond
thorn forward.
When National Guard regiments
got to the border thoy will not be able
to maintain thotr Stato brigade and
division organizations, but will ba
assigned In such units and to such
commands as exigencies require.
Inquiry of the War Department on
this subject brought forth a state
ment from the Secretary that "the
Nattonal Guard is to do border
patrol duty and their organisation
will have to depend upon the neces
sities of that duty."
The War Dopartment had no ad
vices to-day showing definitely the
progress of the mobilization of the
100,000 Nattonal Guardsmen railed for
bordor service.

TOKIO, Juno S3. Tho Mitsui
Company Informed a representative
of the Associated Press to-day that
tt recently received Inquiries from the
Mexican Government aa to whether
it could supply munitions andjarms.
The company replied thal"lt' was
physically Impossible, as It had more
orders than It could fill for the allies
of Japan.
Tho Mitsui, Taliada and Okurn,
three largo companies exporting
arm, formed a Joint munition cor
poration before the war to purchose
munitions from tho Government
arsenal, which Is thu only establish
ment of tho kind In Japan.
"Of course, any claim that the Jap
anese Government will assist Mexi
cans with munitions and arma is out
of the question and absurd," said
Haron Ishll. Foreign Minister, when
asked to-day for his vlows on the
Mmio.m situation. Tho Interview wns
sought on account of declarations at
tributed to Moxlcans that assurances
had bctn received from Japan that
lttons and other assistance would
bo given to Mexico In the event of
war with the United Btatos.
"As for nrlvato Japanese companies

United States and Mexico may be
avoided. Japan's Interest In America

event bringing disturbances Into the

set" Baron Ishll expressed surprise
when the correspondent reforred to
Gen. Jlamon Iturbe, a representative
of Gen. Carranza who was reported
sevnral weeks ago to be on his way
to Japan on a secret mission. The
Baron deolarod he never had heard
of Gen. Iturbo or his projected visit.
He explained that he regarded tho
Carranza government oji tho do facto
Government of Mexico, and that the
usual relations with Gen. Carranza
were being maintained.
Japan'a Interests in Mexico, he
said, were in charge of Beoretary

said ho had received no advices from

WASHINGTON. June 23. Tho

This request wua explained us not

Great Britain was selectod chiefly
because of hor extensive Intorusts and

and her consequent ability to look
after whatever might arise.

EL PASO, Texas, June 23. Reports received
to-day by American mining companies from Mexi
can sources stated that Troops C and K of the Tnth
United States Cavalry were practically annihilated
'in the fighting at Carrizal when led into the Gar
ranzista trap.
1 wmie there is no official news confirming this
report, army officers are without any information
as to the fate of the cavalry commanded by Capt.
j Lewis G. Morey.
The posibiIity that the squadron of the Eleventh Cavalry sent to
their relief has also been engaged by the Carranzistas caused the gravest
I anxiety in official circles here to-day.
! Nothing has been heard from Morey's men sine thev were lured
into ambush Wednesday and cut up by machine gun fire. Gen. Pershing
has arranged to reinforce the relief column if it is attacked.
It is reported that the seventeen troopers, taken to Chihuahua after
the Carrizal fight, were being brought to Juarez to be turned over to
American authorities.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 23. Fear that the casualties suffered
by Capt. Boyd's command had been very heavy was expressed by army
officers here. It was pointed out that if twelve men had been killed, as
reported, it would mean that from thirty-five to forty had been wounded,
according to the usual proportion. According to all accounts there were
seventy-six men engaged. Of these Capt. Uoyd and Lieut. Adair and
ten men were killed. Seventeen men were captured. This would leave
forty-seven men to be accounted for.
Indeed, from the reports available so far, it is by no means certain
that Capt. Boyd's cor-imand was not practically wiped out.
The stragglers who inudu reports f
were unable to glvo any Vie-
