STRICKEN M STREET
B. W.jnjFF EXPIRES
While Being Carried Into
His Home Was An Old
Citizen.
Mr. B. W. Huff, for nearly thirty
years a well-known resident of this
city, one time connected with the
Clyde Line, and later for many years
rate clerk in the local offices of the
Atlantic Coast Line Railway, was
stricken with his second stroke of
paralysis last Monday just before
noon while walking on Lemon street.
He was picked up and taken to his
home on Dodge street, but expired just
as he was being carried into the
house.
It is nearly two years since Mr.
Huff suffered his first stroke, which
had incapacitated him from work
since, though for the past year and
a half he has been able to got out a
little each day.
Mr. Huff was a member of St.
John's Lodge, K. of P., and had been
a member for nearly twenty-five
years. Ho was a Past Chancellor of
the lodge also and one of its best
posted members.
His funeral was attended by mem
bers of the lodge and the full honors
of the order were exemplified at his
burial. At the funeral service in the
home Tuesday morning Rev. S. Grady
of the Methodist church officiated.
Mr. Huff is survived by his widow,
Mrs. Etta Huff, and one son, a law
student in the office ofs.1. V. Walton.
Mooney & Davis had charge of the
interment.

They were gathering up the re
mains of the feast when The News
man visited Jeff Doyle's pool room
yesterday morning. The floor was
covered with bread crumbs and cigar
ette and cigar stubs and two men
were engaged in sweeping them up
and putting the place in order. In
the right foyer which is divided from
the main room by a wire screen were
some dozen or more uncut loaves of
bread, and on the floor with a look
and sound of emptiness stood three
hall-barrel beer kegs. Tin cups hold
ing a pint each were piled in a
heap and had a stale beer smell. Al
so the pitchers which had not been
broken at the cistern.
The soft June air was blowing
through the open windows and much
of the odor of the night before had
escaped into the outer sunlight and
been so thoroughly diluted that the
morning visitor could only in imagi
nation get a whiff of the place as it
was before the odors of the night sea
son had become melted in thin air.
"Yes, it was an immense crowd,"
said Jeff, whom we met on the street
as we came out, "and they had some
feed. Why, bless your heart man,
there was more'n three hundred peo
ple in there at one time and beer!
Say, I drew off thirty-two gallons in
less than forty minutes. It was a
'smoker,' given by the successful
candidates to the populace I reckon
populace is good and everybody was
invited. Some came in from the
country, but the majority of those
present were home people. They fur
nished cigars, sandwiches, pigs feet,
pickles and beer. We had nil the ta
bles used in the old business college
out on the floor and everybody was
invited to help themselves. Some
feast; you bet. Began at 7:"0 and
lasted until midnight. They (the
candidates who were successful) just
told me to go ahead and get it up
and word was passed that resulted in
a full house. No, nobody was 'full'
but the house, and say; one time I
thought 1V1 have to tear the paper
oli"n the walls to get the crowd in.
Hadn't heard about it; bless your
soul, whore was ye? thought every
body knew about it. Sorry you wasn't
present."
This is the story of the feed fest
. ' . .1! l.i..
given y the winning candidates m
token of their appreciation at Doyle's
place on Wednesday night. And Jeff
hasn't overstated it.
No, not, all the winning candidates
participated; some of 'em are pro
hibitionists and "Guardeens;" if he
was only one of 'em, and that the lat
ter, he could attend and not fracture
his reputation. But if he was a pro
hibitionist, no matter how bad he
wanted to go, he couldn't because if
he had he'd a been caught at it, and
not bein' used to sich things, he'd been
one of the mourners going about the
streets Thursday morning, or would
have been in bed with cold towels
swathed about his apex in an endeav
or to subdue the swelling and cast out
the ache.
No, the beer wasn't sold; it was
given away; it was procured under
the sealed package provisions of the
Davis law and came up from Jagson

Mr. Hall reports that the efforts of

large number of memberships have
been subscribed and he states that

During his stay here Mr. Hall nm

the property.
The word came to Band Leader
Chattaway on Monday evening. He
had been prepared by reading in the
morning papers that President Wil
son had called out the National
Guard of the several states to the
number of 100,000 to patrol the Mex
ican border, and was sniffing the mar
tial air which was pervading Palatka.
Therefore he was not surprised when
he received a telegram from General
Foster to round up the band boys
i and have them ready at a moment's
j notice to leave for Black Point, the
i rendesvouz for Florida troops.
Chattaway rounded era. By lues
day evening they were ready to leave,
and all expected to take the early
morning train for camp. But there
was a hitch.
On Tuesday evening the band gave
its farewell street concert and a big
crowd was present. During the con
cert the young ladies of the "Ladies'
Band'1 presented Prof. Chattaway with
a big boquet. Young Currey held
aloft in the center of the band ring
the American flag. The band closed
the program with Dixie and The
Star Spangled Banner. Applause
greeted every number, but when it
came to the finishing numbers hats
came off and a yell followed the play
ing. Young wives were in the crowd and
mothers and sisters to the band boys.
There was some weeping. Citizens
pressed about at the conclusion of the
concei t and bade good bye to the boys.
They expected them to go on the early
morning train.
But they were all on the street next
morning; there had been a hitch, or
some misunderstanding at the head
quarters of the generalissimo in St.
Augustine. The boys said the delay
would be for 4 hours; that they
would not go until Thursday morning.
But on Thursday morning they were
still here that is to say, most of
them. Rut the delay was utilized by
several of them in communicating with
Tallahassee. They asked the govern
or for a pardon, reciting sob-stories
that" would move any man with a
heart, especially one who had just
been promoted by the people to the
U. S. Senate. At least two pardons
were granted on Thursday those of
Herman Collette of Crescent City and
Herbert Appleby of this city. They

excuse for wanting to remain in Pa

pa i don hadn't arrived, but he was so
sure of it that the Gainesville lieuten
ant in command let him off condi
tionally. George can't play a horn,
but he was the drum major with his
soul and arms filled with the ryt'.nn
of the music. Another was assigned
to the drum majorship and this left
our popular young attorney stranded,
as it were, with nothing ahead but a
possible exchange to that of trench
digger extraordinary, and his muscles
no slack. So he applied for a par
don. Mr. Everson had been undecid
ed all the time. At certain time3 he
was reconciled to the call, then again
his soul revolted at the prospect; it
was during one of these soul revolts
that ho applied for a pardon. He
savs that

Black Point there to remain until the
Second Regiment is ready for the
march to Mexico. The days dispatch
es seem to indicate that they will not
have long to wait. Those who com

were J. W. Chattaway, director; Thos.

W. H. Beaslev, George Coddbgton, R.

Frank Appleby, C. H. Strockmnn, A.
M. Clemens, Mark Shaw.
Yesterday morning a telegram was
received from Adjutant General Fos
ter. St. Augustine, to effect that no
cm; short of the Secretary of War
himself could release an enlisted man,
now. It was different on Tuesday.
Rut on Tuesday night all the boys
signed articles of enlistment placing
them in the hands of the United
States. The releases from Gov.
Trammell came after these men had
re-signed. Collette and Appleby were
among the signers, and there is a
doubt concerning the value of their
"parodn." They may have to go yet,
although the Secretary of War might
honor a request from the Governor of
I-'lorida.
Be it said that the boys who sought
and obtained release had the best of
reasons family ties and relatives de
pendent on them for support. There
wasn't a white feather in the bunch.
Most of them were anxious for the
fray and impatient to get away.
We can all feel a pride in Palatka's
contribution to what promises to be
another war with Mexico.

Twenty U. S. Soldiers Killed

by Carranzistas.
Americans Said to Have Been Drawn
Into Ambush by Mexicans Clash Fol
lows on Heels of Wilson's Warning.
El Pasco, Tex., June 21. American
and Carranza troops fought a sangui
nary battle today on the Santo Do
mingo ranch, near the town of Carri
zal and tonight it had not been learned
with which side rested the victory.
The number of dead, American or
Mexican, was not definitely known
here, but nearly a score of General
Pershing's men are said to have been
killed and the Mexicans are said to
have lost more than forty. Seven
teen Americans are declared by Mex
ican offiicials to have been captured
and to have been hurried to Chihua
hau City under adequate guard. A
machine gun used by the Mexicans is
reported to have done heavy execu
tion. The scene of the fight was just nine
miles southwest of Villa Ahumada,
the Mexican field headquarters in
northern Chihauhau, and the clash oc
curred only a few hours after Presi
dent Wilson's 6,000-word note warn
ing Carranza that the "gravest con
sequences" would follow an attack up
on American troops had gone for
ward. The Americans engaged are thought
to have been members of a troop
from the Tenth cavarly, a negro regi
ment, returning from a scouting trip
to Guzman. The size of the Mexi
can force, whose commander, Gen. Fe
lix Gomez, was killed, is not known.
KNOTT WILL BEG
SUIT TO SETTLE
GjpORSf
Wr. V. Knott, candidate for gover
nor in the democratic primaries of the
(ilh inst., has decided after a consul
tation with his friends from all sec
tions of the State to contost the nomi
nation of Sidney .1. Catts, who upon
the face of the official returns from
fifty of the fifty-two counties, and
two counties unofficial, has a lead of
17(i votes.
The general confusion of the vot
ing, counting and canvassing of the
second choice votes has brought
about an element of uncertainty that
is so general that a question of doubt
is felt by a large percentage of those
who voted, that the face of the re
turns are not the correct expression
of those voting.
Mandamus proceedings will be in
stituted to settle who has been nomi
nated as governor.
Monster Meeting Being Plan
ned for Interlachen on
July 20th.
The plan to build a smooth highway
reaching from Palatka to Gainesville,
with branches from Interlachen to
Grandin and Putnam Hall, and to con
nect with Melrose, are being discuss
ed in the western part of the county,
and while some opposition has devel
oped, it is apparent that the good peo
ple in west Putnam are pretty well
united on the necessity of such a road.
Advocates of the road are at work
and are planning to call a monster
meeting of the people along the pro
posed line in Putnam county at Inter
lachen about July 20th, when the road
will be discussed and if the sentiment
is favorable committees will be ap
pointed to set the machinery in mo
tion to secure the road.
Mr. J. H. Wyllie, one of the fore
most road advocates in the county,
tells The News that Interlachen peo
ple are going to entertain lavishly on
the day of the road meeting. They
are going to feed the multitude with
a good, old-fashioned fish fry and bas
ket picnic dinner.
"People from Alachua county will bo
there," said he "and it is hoped that a
sentiment will be created that will re
sult in the building of a substantial
highway leading from Palatka to
Gainesville. The sentiment so far
expressed seems to favor the sand
asphalt roads, for the reason largely
that we have much of the material in
the county and along the line of the
reposed r0ad with which to build it.
A ny way, these will be matters for the
meeting to discuss and decide upon.
What we want now, is a monster
meeting of people interested in thi3
much needed improvement to meet at
Interlachen and be the guests for tha
day of our little town, and talk it
over. We want the Palatka people,
perhaps the most interested, to come
to us in force and help boost."

annual conventions to talk over a few
business matters, but like all State

pleasures which spring eternal in the
breast of men united by a common
effort to make a living. They ban

Then there is the State Board of j
Pharmacy, a board appointed under l
the law by the Governor. This board j
examines all applicants for license ts

board also has power to revoke li

of the business. D. W. Ramsaur of
the Ackerman-Stewart Drug Co. is the
secretary of this board, and one of
the examiners. Fact is it has been
said by those outside that he is the

The board also banquets and dances
