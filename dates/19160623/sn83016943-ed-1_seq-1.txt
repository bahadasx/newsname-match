In Case of Victory
IV. Russia
"We need an outlet to the sea.
It was not for that we went to
war, yet without it we cannot end
the war." In those words Prof.
Taul MilukofT in the Russian
Duma only a few weeks ago ex
pressed the chief aspiration of his
government.
Bussia is hemmed in. The em
pire covers one-seventh of the
land surface of the globe and
rules over one tenth of the human
race, yet it has nowhere a con
venient outlet to the open ocean.
On the west its shipping must
pass through the narrow and
easily obstructed straits between
the Baltic and the Kattegat. On
the south it has no outlet except
. through the Dardenelles, even
now in possession of an enemy.
On the north coast it has ports,
but during many months of the
year ice closes all of them to ship
ping except the new port of
Ekaterina. In the far east it has
Vladivostok, which also is often
ice-locked, and which can be
reached only by crossing two con
sineuts over a single line of rail
way. For centuries Russia has
tried to acquire Constantinople
and the Bosporus. Many times it
has been within striking distance
of the goal, only to be foiled br
other nations acting in behalf of
what is known, as the "Conceit
of Kuropc." Great Britain
fought the Crimean war to frus
trate that Bussian ambition.
Moreover, it intervened after the
Busso Turkish War of 1S73, and
overthrew the treaty ' of Kin
Stefano, which would have
brought Bussia within sight of its
cherished rnirpose. It is clear
that, if the Entente allies are vie
toiious, Great Britain will now
oiler no objection to the transfer
of Constantinople to the potver
that it so long distrusted. For
Bussia it is apparent now or

tional Convention.
never, ana uic government aim
the people arc resolved not to lay
down their arms until the dream
ol centuries is realized.
But the Dardanelles is not the
only hope of Bussia. Nothing
could be more disastrous to its
interests than the accomplish
ment of the German purpose
"from Berlin to Bagdad." The
whole "Eastern question" is con
cerned, and in the opinion of litis
sia now is the time to settle it for
ever. As long as the question is
open there must be friction be
tween Bussia and Austria. Bus
sia wishes to dominate the Balkan
states. Defeat means the cxtinc
tiou of Serbia and Montenegro,
the end of Bussian influence in
the Balkan peninsula and the
transfer of the region nominally
to Austria, but really to Ger
many. Obviously, Bussia stands to
gam or to lose more than any of
its allies. Victorious, it will
achieve ends that have spurred
its rulers and statesmen to action
during many couturies. De
feated, it will be hemmed in still
further and will su Her a certain
amount of dismemberment be
sides. As in the case of France,
the sentiment of neutral peoples
toward Bussia has changed ma
terially in the last two years. The
nations knew that Bussia was
valorous in battle, but they re
garded it as little more than half
civilized, and the government as
despotic and brutal. If that
estimate has not been wholly
abandoned it has at least been con
siderably modified. Youth's
Companion.

Editor Bencor:
Since my return home from the
trrcat National Democratic Convention
which was held at St. Louis, I have
concluded to give you and the people of
the county an outline of what I saw
and heard.
The Mississippi headquarters were at
the Marquette hotel, three or four
blocks away from the Coliseum where
the convention was held. There was a
fairly good representation from our
state, but when I looked around and
saw the great number of delegates
and onlookers that came from other
stites in the Union, I felt like our peo
ple were not taking the interest in
this great event that they should take.
The convention was called to order
by Chairman McComh on Wednesday
morning and Governor Glynn of New
York was chosen as the temporary
chairman, and Senator OIlie James of
Kentucky was elected permanent
chairman. Gov. Glynn, it is claimed
made one of the most magnificent
soul-Btirring and patriotic speech
that was ever delivered bv anyone on
such an occasion. He was in splendid
voice and every word could be heard
throughout that groat auditorium
where there mu"t have been at least
twenty thousand people. No doubt
many of the Beacon's readers have had
the pleasure of reading this great
speech. There was no mistake mnd
in the selection of Gov. Glynn to pros
ent the keynote of the campaign of
our ereat nartv. After conclusion of
this speech, the various committees
were selected and the convention ad
journed until the next day. On I he
following dav. the chairman, Oli'.c
.lames, made a great speech. A preal
many thought it was equal to Gov.
Glynn's. Senator James is a very
large, commanding person, being some
thing over six feet tall, and ho had
equally as good a voice as Gov. Glynn,
and had the strictest attention durii.p
the entire time he was speaking. The
demonstrations by the audience are
almost indescribable. The enthusiasm
on every side was greater and more
deadly in earnest than anything that I
ever witnessed.
The convention then adjourned until
Thursday night at nine o'clock. Hav
ing been invited out, along with the
Mississippi d legation, to an entertain
ment at the Sunset club, we did not
reach the Coliseum until after the con
vention had assembled. When we ar
rived, we found the streets and doors
around the great building blocked by a
crowed estimated to be twenty-live
thousand in number. And no one, not
even a delegate, could get through
that crowd without the aid of two or
three policemen. Bryan made one cf
his characteristic speeches that night,
which of course, captivated the crowd.
The best part of it though, was that it
was a speech which showed he was
loyal to Wilson.
Another session was held the next
day. While waiting for the commit
tee on Resolutions to report, Senator
Heed of Missouri also made quite a
telling speech. After the commit U
had reported, the session adjourned
sine die. I forg-jt to say that Wilson
and Marshall were nominated with but
one dissenting voice, that was by a
1. 'legate from Chicago, nn unrecon
structed Irishman named Burke. He
claimed that he was instructed to vote
against Wilson. All of the big men of
the party who were there are hopeful
and believe that we arc going to have
a great Democratic convention i:i St.
Louis twelve years ago. I do not
think there were over twenty-five or
thirty ladies in the hall at any session
thereof. I do not think I overestimate
when I say that at every session of
this last convention there were from
two to three thousand women present
and there were thousands on the out
aide who were unable to procure
tickets of admission.
We men folks may say what we
please about the suffragettes but in
let s than twenty-five years I believe
the women will be voting in every
state in the Union. I want to ask
this question; "Have you ever known
the good women to start out to accom
plish something where they did not
succeed?" I know that it will be diffi
cult to ever convince the men cf the
South that it is the proper thing f cr a
nice sv. cot woman to yote a".d engage
in politics.
I am pleased to say that everything
was harmonious with the Mississippi
delegation. And they even accorded a
hearing to three representatives of the
8ulfrii0bts, every one of whom was
applauded for what wan uaid.
We are proud of the Mississippi
colony why are now making St. Louis
J heir home. They are a royal set of
fellows. There ate a good many of
your readers who are acquaintfd with
Charlie Williams who lived here once
as a young lawyer, hia brother R, P.
Williams who once practiced law in
Meridian, and Frank Curlee who went
from Booneville, Miss. These ex-Mis
sissippians did everything in their
power to make our stav in the city as
pleasant as possible. They wined and
dined the delegation, gave them auto
mobile rides ai.d excursions on the
river; in fact nothing was wanting on
their part to make our stay in St,
Louis, while not in the convention, ks
agreeable as possible. Our hats will
always be off to the greitt City of St,
Louis, and to these Mississippians for
their royal entertainment of the Mis
sissippi delegation.
Yours,
T. W. Brame.

Bankrupt Law Shouldbe Repealed
Our national bankrupt law
should lie repealed. It is the
most vicious law upon our Fed
eral statutes. It is fundamental
ly wrong. Its unjust effects arc
so many and so manifest that one
advocating its repeal before an
intelligent public need not go into
detail or lengthy argument.
In former times when unfortun
ate men were imprisoned for debt
there was good ground for a bank
rupt law in vocable by honest
debtors. But the barbarous cus
tom of imprisonment for debt no
h nger prevails; therefore the true
object of a bankrupt law no
longer exists.
That at intervals during more
than one hundred years the Con
gtess of the Butted States has
enacted bankrupt laws does not
meet the argument. There are
pei haps more precedents for that
w hieli is bad. "

co i rages dishonesty. " . .
Credit is made hazardous legit
imate business is endangered the"
unscrupulous are made more
audacious and the weak are made
more venturesome when such a
aw is on our statute books.
A. very small proportion of the
business in the United States is
transacted for actual moncv.
Without confidence and credit
our commerce virtually would be
strayed. Therefore, credit
should be highly valued, wisely
protected and in every way en
couraged. It furnishes work for
the laborer and bread for the
needy and helps in all that is
for the good of men. Therefore,
promises, lor right purposes,
agreements, contracts, obligations,
honor and honesty should be held
sacred.
Creditors on many occasions
need to lie merciuu, but no one
save the creditor can lustlv re
lieve the deDtor. The funda
mental right to so relieve does
not exist in government. One
who fails to pay does not cease to
owe.
It would be a startling revela
tion to the public if all the hid
den and illegitimate transactions
of bankrupts and the attorneys
who practice in these courts were
laid bare to public gaze and
knowledge. Many of the lawyers
who practice in the bankrupt
courts of our country would be
disbarred if their perfidy and in
tidelity to their clients were made
known.
The democratic party, now in
power, can give additional evi
dence of its good faith ami honesty
of purpose if it will repeal the
bankrupt law, Collins Commercial.
Lef Your Boy Enlist
Does your son want to enlist in the
National Guard?
If so, let him go forthwith to the re
cruiting station and sign the muster
roll.
Don't answer him with the cowardly
excuse that you didn't raise your boy
to be a soldier.
Neither did you raise him to be a
mollycoddle. If you did, you have
been guilty of a grievous injustice.
The boy knows, far better than you
do, whether it is his iluty to otl'er'for
lervice.
If he has reached his majority, it is
up to him to say whether or not his
country is calling him.
Your ideas or opinions should have
nothing whatever to do with it.
A man's duty to his country is a
question that he alone can determine.
-jHi-kwn Newt).
According to a story which the
Xcw York "World declares came
into its office well authenticated,
a visitor at Sagamore Hill the
other day put this question to
Colonel Boosevelt: "Colonel,
what do you think is the greatest,
most outstanding difference be
tween President AVilson and
Justice Hughes!"
Boosevelt's reply came back
like a whip-snap:
'There isn't any dillercncc be
tween Wilson and Hughes" said
he ''that a barocr couldn't remove
in ten minutes."
AVhother rightly or wrongly,
Woodrow Wilson has been pic
tured as a man who is cold, delib
erate and dispassionate a man to
whom even his closest friends
could not warm up. It is interest
ing to note that Mr. Hughes is
depicted as the same sort of char
acter. Indeed, the weather in
the Bepublican convention is said
to liavo touched zero when the
nominations had been finished.
Victor Murdock, the red-headed
chairman of the Bull Moose na
tional committee, had this
thought in mind when in a
speech in the auditorium conven
tion, ho referred to the Bepubli
can ticket as "that tribute to the
Arctic circle."
However, whatever may be the
similiaiity between Wilson and
Hughes in this respect, the pro
Cei uians ara certainly able to dis
tinguish a very wide difference in
other respects. Without waiting
to hear from Mr. Hughes his
definition of "Americanism" and
undivided allegiance to America,
the tlerman-Auierican press has
gone over to Hughes in a body.
It is to be judged I roni this that
without having to meet any of
the responsibilities of the diplo
matic problems brought about by
the war in lOuropc, and without
having made any decisions with
respect to American rights ami
intonation law, Mr. Hughes funis
more favor at Berlin as a candi
date for President of the United
Slates than Woodrow Wilson.
