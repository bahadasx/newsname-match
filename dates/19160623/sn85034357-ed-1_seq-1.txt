End Came in Richmond Wednes?
day Afternoon After Several
Weeks' Illness?Burial Near
Old Home Today.
Mr. W. P. Payne, aged about. 64
years, died at Westbrook Sanitarium,
near Richmond, on Wednesday af?
ternoon. Tile remains reached Tttze
well on yesterday morning, and were
brought to his home here. Burial
takes place this morning near Randy,
in this county. Besides a widow he
leaves two daughters and three sons,
viz: Mrs. R. L>. Young, Mrs. \V. B.
Young, Messrs. C. C., Jay, and .1 B.
Payne, and a large number of friends
and relatives, who mourn his loss.
Mr. Payne had been in poor health
for several years. For the past year
or so he had kept his room and bed
much of his time. The latter part, of
May his condition became alarming,)
and he was taken to a sanitarium near,
Richmond. For atimc hopes were en?
tertained of his final recovery, but
soon all hope was given up, and the
end known to be only a matte:- of
time. For some time before his death
he remained in a slate of uncon?
sciousness, suffering apparently from
W. P. PAYNE,
who died in Richmond Tuesday af?
ternoon.
almost total paralysis, in winch con?
dition he passed away on Wednesday
afternoon, about three o'clock.
W. P. Payne was a successful law?
yer and business man, vigorous and
enthusiastic, and gave promise of a
lon^ life. He was popular, and exert?
ed an influence in his community, ami
in West. Virginia, where he practised
law, and bad many friends and ad?
mirers. He leaves a large and valu?
able estiite in this section. A year or
more ajjo he left his farm and home
in "Sinking Waters," ami erected a
handsome and commodious resilience
in this town, in which he resided with
his family, at the time of Iiis death.
He, like all of us, had his failings,
shortcomings, and weaknesses. At a
time like this we minimize faults and
magnify virtues, lie had many line
traits of character, and will he missed
not only by his family, hut by many
friends and acquaintances in this sec?
tion of the state, and in West Vir?
ginia. May tho sod of his native sal
ley rest lightly upon him!
FOUND IN A BOTTLE!
There was great excitement on the
steamer Lafayette a few weeks ago
when a bottle was discovered floating
near by its huge propellers. The boat
was brough to a stop and with diffi?
culty the bottle was brought on
board. Inside the bottle was found a
note, which will be Interesting to the
readers of this paper, hence WO quote
same word for word. It was address?
ed:
"To my friends in Tazewell, Va.?
When youlind this bottle containing
this note 1 will be no more. The boat.
.Saratoga, on which I am, has struck
a leak and is fast sinking, in a few
minutes it will be resting on the bot?
tom of this roaring ocean. I take
this method of sending my farewell
words to my friends, trusting that
some steamer may locate this bottle.
And now I am sinking, and as I sink
it is with one great regret?that I
will be unable to attend the Red Tag
Sale at Chapman's on July 5th. Such
Wonderful Bargains!"
This note was signed, but was so
indistinct that the name could not be
read. We know though that she was a
wise woman, and we regret that we
will see her face no more.

Corn Roys Increasing in Number.
Three thousand hoys are entered
in the 1016 Virginia Corn Growing
Contest. Last year an average yield
of C2 1-10 bushels of corn per acre
was secured by those who took part.
Twenty-eight boys made over 100
bushels lo the acre and Marius Mal
gren, who won the Stale Champion?
ship, grew 201) bushels and '10 lbs.
of corn on his prize acre. A cover
crop had been grown the preceding
year, the ground had been top-dress?
ed with manure during the winter,
and an application of :>00 pounds of
fertilizer were used by the 15-ycar
old boy in making the record yield,
which was secured at the cost of
eleven and three-tenths cents per bu?
shel.
Count v Agents Increase Alfalfa
Yields.
Every county agent in Virginia
lias had successful alfalfa demonstra?
tions during the past year, and a to- '
I tal of 4588 acres are now being f
grown under demonstration methods,'
according to T. O. Sandy, Slate Ag
^?nt. The increase per acre bus aver?
aged one and one-third tons of cured
hay over the ordinary methods. The
increased value of the extra yield of
alfalfa hay at the rate of S15 per
ton a nounts to 887,8-47.50. This sum
ir; more than sufficient to pay the
salaries of ell the county agents in
the state for the year.
The careful preparation of the Bocd
bed, inoculation, the use of well
drained land, the correction of acid?
ity and the liberal use of fertilizer
to give the crop a quick start and
curry it ulong well insure success
with" alfalfa. For the first time in the
history of the state, Virginia last
y.-ar raised enough hay to supply her
local markets.

AUTOMOBILE OVER TURNS
Rev. C. R. Brown, and his family,
including- Mrs. Brown, Misses Maj
and Mary, and Robert Brown, and ;.
narrow escape from serious injury lasi
Thursday afternoon, when their Cad?
illac touring car skidded and over?
turned at a point near Narrows, in
Giles county, and went down an em?
bankment several feet, pinioning all
the occupants of the car, except Rob?
ert Brown, who was in a position that

the others. The only injury sustain?

small bone broken. The family tool;
the train and came to Blueficld on
Thursday night, where Mr. Brown
sought, medical attention. They later
returned to their home here. Mr.
Brown will be compelled to use crut?
ches for sometime.
The accident was caused by the
muddy and consequent slippery con?
dition of the roads, notwithstanding
the fact that chains had been placed
on each of the four wheels. It is said
that but for a telegraph pole which
stood in the path of the tumbling car
the machine would have continued
down tlie embankment into New Riv?

TAZEWELL, VIJ
REJECTS DEMAND
President Wilson, in Strong Note
to Carranza, Flatly Refuses to
Withdraw American Troops
From Mexico.
Washington, Juno 'JO.?The Am
:m note, flatly rejecting Ucnernl
s':i! unsa's demnnil for a withdrawn!
of the United States troops from
Mexico, was handed to Bliseo Arrc
i?atc here today, it was addressed to
i hi; Mexican secretary of foreign re?
lations and was signed by Secretary
I.;.using.
"1 would be wanting in candor,''
says the opening paragraph, "if I
did not, before making answer to
the allegations of fact and the con?
clusions reached by your government,
express the surprise and regret
which have been caused this govern?
ment by the discourteous tone of this
last communication of the de facto
government of Mcxtca.
CONTINUOUS BLOODSHED.
"The government of the United
States has viewed with deep concern
progress of the revolution in Mexico.
Continuous bloodshed and disorders
have marked its progress. Foi three
years the Mexican republic has been
torn with civil strife; the lies of
Americans and ether ;.liens have been
sacrificed; vast properties developed
by American capital and enterprise
have been destroyed or rendered non?
productive. Bandits have been per?
mitted to roam at will through the
territory contiguous to the United
States and lo seize without, punish?
ment or without, effective attempt at
punishment the property of Ameri?
cans, while the lives of citizens of
Ihe United States who ventured to
remain in Mexican territory or to
return there to protect their inter?
ests have been taken, and the mur?
derers have neither been apprehend?
ed nor brought to justice, it would
he difficult to lind in the nnitnls of
history of Mexico, conditions more
deplorable than those which have ex?
isted there during these recent years
of civil war."
BORDER OUTRAGES.
The note, which contains about 0,
100 words, then recites at length the
lordcr depredations of the last nine
American garrisons have been at?
tacked at night, American soldiers
killed and their horses and equip?
ment stolen, American ranches have
been raided and American trains
wrecked and plundered. In these at?
tacks, it. adds, Carranzisla adherents
and even Carranzisla soldiers too!:
part in the looting, burning and kill?
ing.
Depredations upon American per?
sons and property within American I
jurisdiction hue been still more nu?
merous, says the nine, in making ref?
erence to tho Santa Ysnbel massacre
of January 10, and adds:
"General Carranza stated lo the
agent of the department of state that
he had issued orders for the imme?
diate pursuit, capture anil punish?
ment of those responsible for ibis
atrocious crime and appealed to this
government, and to the American peo?
ple to consider the difficulties of ac?
cording protection along the railroad
where the massacre occurred. * *?
DECLARED OUTLAWS.
It is true that Villa, Castro, and Lo?
pez were publicly declared to he out?
laws and subject lo apprehension and
execution, but so far as known, only
a single man, personally connected
with Ibis massacre, has been brought
to justice by Mexican authorities.
Within a month after this barbarous
slaughter of inoffensive Americans it
was notorious that Villa was operat?
ing within twenty miles of Cusihui
rachic, and publicly stated that his
purpose was to destroy American
lives and property. Despite repeated
and insistent demands that military
protection should he furnished Am?
ericans, Villa openly carried on his
operations, constantly approaching
closer and closer to the border. He
was not intercepted, nor were his
movements impeded by troops of the
de facto government and no effectual
attempt was made to frustrate his
hostile designs against Americans. *
* * Villa's unhindered activities cul?
minated in the unprovoked and cold
blooded attack upon American citi?
zens and soldiers in the town of Co?
lumbus, on the night of March 0th.
"After murdering, burning, and
fleeing south, passed within sight of
the Carranzisla military post at Gil?
sas Grandes and no attempt was
made to stop him by the garrison of
the do facto government stationed
there."
PURSUIT HALTED.
The note then refers to the pursuit
of the Columbus raiders by the Am?
erican forces as far as Para, "where
the pursuit was halted by the hos
tolty of Mexicans presumed to be
loyal to the de facto government, and
who became in effect the protectors
of Villa and his bnnd."
Negotiations with the Mexican de
facto government direct and the
Scr.tt-Obregon conference regarding
the first American expedition into
Mexico are discussed in the note.
First Car Over Princeton Line.
Bluefield, June 20.?The first car
to pass over the new Bluefleld-Prin
colon electric line was run Sunday

STOP "CHEWING."
(Editorial.)
The Evening Journal, in several of
its recent, issues harps on the omis?
sion from the Democratic pint
form, of a declaration in favor of
woman suffrage, and earnestly con?
tends that, the Democrats "lost a great
opportunity" to win favor in certain
parts of the great west, which states
are not very favorable to Mr. Wil?
son. Be this as it may, we fail utterly
to see that any good whatsoever can
come to the party or to Mr. Wilson
by the repeated (mild) attacks of
the platform of the. party. It is too
late now to discuss the matter, ami
a discussion can only result in injury
to the party. Let's all talk harmony
now, and not discord, is the motto.
Stop chewing the rag.
Let's play tag?July 5th. to 15th.
Jim Kelly, who received his civil
engineer's degree from the Catholic
University in Washington, this year,
returned home the first of the week.
It is understood that he will soon
take a position as engineer with the

Editor Visits in the Cove.

a call at the home of Mr. ami Mrs.
S. J. Thompson last Sunday after?
noon. Oapl. and Mrs. Rees Uowcn.
Mr. and Mrs. II. A. liowcn, Mr. and
I Mrs. .1. Powell Itoyall, were there,
with all the little UOWCns and Koy
1 alls, and everybody was having a
royal time (no pun), as everybody
does who visils in that home. Miss'
Laura Lyons, a summer visitor, Mr.
and Mrs. Harry Thompson, and their
pretty baby, made up the crowd.
Harry and his young wife make their
home there. Hon. S. J. Thompson had
not returned from St. Louis, whither
be went us a delegate to the national
convention, to assist in nominating
the next President of the United
Stales. On his return he dropped by
Chicago to be present at some big
entile function occurring on Monday
of this week. He reached home on
Wednesday.
While there, Sunday though it was,
the temptation to look at a bunch of
big cattle could not be resisted. There
were 'Jl in the bunch, near the house,
which are being fed about H bushels
a tlay of a well balanced ration, as an
experiment. The cattle were weighed
in, and all weighed every thirty tlays.
A strict account is kept, and in the
end a computation will be mittle. The
cattle are already fat?some of them
very fat, and it looks now as though
tho experiment will prove a paying
one.
