MKS OF HOOD
ROADS DISTRICT HIE
CUM) STATED
Sec. 1, Chapter 55, Session Laws
1911. "The improvement of highways
is hereby declared to be established
and permanent policy of the State of
Idaho; the duty is hereby imposed on
the Highway Boards provided for by
this act of improving and maintaing
the highways within their districts and
of securing as rapidly as the public
revenues will permit, and of maintain
ing permanent good roads of hard
surface and properly graded and avail
able for convenient travel thereon
throughout the years."
The reason of organizing and main
taining highway districts is concisely
set forth in the foregoing section of
the statute. The advantages to be de
rived are many and wherever tried
these districts give good results. Di
vision of the county into small units
for road and bridges in the districts
and also gives the residents in the dis
tricts a more direct voice in how their
money shall be spent. They elect their
own highway board who spend the
money in the district instead of the
county commissioners spending it over
the county.
A glance at the maps accompany
ing the petitions now ready for circu
lation show that the proposed Cald
well Highway district is practically
surrounded by .highway districts;
Nampa Highway district to the east,
Notus on the north and west, and
Wilder on the west. All roads leading
to Nampa are rapidly being put in
first class condition on practically
what money said districts draw from
the county.
The statement below will give an
idea of how this matter will work out
in the proposed highway district.
The total sum raised in Canyon
county for road and bridge purposes
for the year 1915, (the year on which
the organization of this district is
based) was approximately $20,000.00.
The total sum raised in the proposed
highway district for road and bridge
purposes for said year was approxi
mately $5000.00. of this sum, $2400.00
was raised by the City of Caldwell.
Twenty-five per cent of the road
fund levied in any municioality is re
tained by said municipality, the bal
ance going into the county road and
bridge fund.
The proportion that the proposed
highway district would get of the
road and bridge fund levied by the
county would be 25 per cent, less 5
per cent which goes to the county.
Taking the amounts mentioned
above, which are approximately cor
rect, during the first year the proposed
highway district would receive the
sum of $4280.00. No part of this sum
can be spent within the incorporated
limits of any muncipality within the
district.
After the first year the Highway
Board may levy a special tax, as dis
tinguished from the district's contri
bution to the general road and bridge
taxes levied by the country, for road
purposes not less than ten cents and
not more than 25 cents on the $100.00
in value of taxable property within
the highway district; for bridge pur
poses, not more than ten cents on the
$100.00. After the first year's levy made
by the Highway Board for road pur
poses when added to the levy for road
purposes made by the Board of
County Commisioners must not exceed
40 cents on the $100.00; the sum total
for bridge purposes shall not exceed
10 cents on the $100.00.
It is also provided in the highway
act that the highway district may be
sub-divided, if the inhabitants there
of desire, and those in the divison may
levy a special tax, the proceeds there
of to be used exclusively in their own
division.

FIRST WAR BRIDE WAS
MISS MABEL SMITH
Young Lady and Mr. Russel Clore
Married Tuesday Evening
The first and only Caldwell war
bride is Miss Mabel Smith. The
happy groom is Mr. Russell Clore.
The marriage occured at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Barnett Tuesday
evening. The Rev. Mr. Ewing, pastor
of the Methodist church, performed
the ceremony. Only the sisters, Misses
Hazel and Dorothy Smith, Mrs. Bar
nett ajid Mr. William Mee were pres
ent to witness the ceremony.
Miss Smith and Mr. Clore are em
ployees at the Caxton printing office,
and have been for a number of years.
They are well known and most highly
esteemed in this city. Miss Smith's
parents live at Payette but formerly
were residents of Caldwell. Mr. Clore
has made his home here for a num
ber of years.
The groom is a member of the
local militia company and left Wed
nesday with his company for Boise.
The entire community wishes the
happy couple the kindest luck, in the
world and trusts that the temp'ôrarv
separation will be of short duration.
PRINTERS LOSE VALUABLE
MEN BY CALL TO ARMS
Four Members of Craft Taken From
Local Printing Houses
The Tribune loses two valuable men,
for the time being by the mobolization
of the national guard. Captain D. F.
Banks is the business manager of the
paper, and Mr. William Mee was our
pressman.
The Caxtons also lose two men.
First Lieutenant Church and Mr. Rus
sel Clore were employees of the Cax
tons.
If the printing trade is älightly de
moralized for a while the reason is
that the best members of the craft are
away in the service of their country.
GOV. TAYLOR CONFIDENT
HE WILL BE NOMINEE
OF THE PARTY
Lieutenant Governor Herman H.
Taylor was in the city a few hours
Wednesday. Governor Taylor has
been at Boise for several days acting
as governor while Governor Alexan
der was at St. Louis attending the
Democratic national convention.
Mr. Taylor, who is a candidate for
the Republican nomination for govern
or, is well pleased with the outlook
so far as his candidacy is concerned
He states that things could not look
better if they were made to order.
Mr. Taylor gave the Tribune the
following brief statement of his views
on his candidacy and the issues of the
campaign.
Platform A Law.
The platform convention will be
held in Boise on the 27th. I want to
have something to do with making it.
I will run for nomination upon that
platform. I believe it should be law
unto a republican.
I expect to carry the north by a
good margin. I have many friends
and acquaintances in many parts of
the state and feel gratified at the as
surances of support which I am re
ceivnig.
I shall so conduct my campaign that
I can and will support the successful
candidate and shall expect the same
from others.
The Republican party is coming
back into power in the state and na
tion.
No Political Debts. ♦
I owe no political debts and shall
be under no obligations as to any ap
pointmcnts or otherwise.
I believe that the affairs of the
land board should be given careful
consideration. That the most com
petent officers available should be se
lected to transact its business. Some
plan should be evolved which will
free the board from criticism.
To do this it must be conducted on
a business basis, without fear or fa
vor.
The school funds of Idaho are a sa
cred trust and must be treated as
such.
1 believe the short ballot in coun
ties should be adopted.
We should have a provision for the
impeachment of officers without the
necessity of a grand jury. With such
provision we will secure efficiency in
office and be able to rid ourselves of
unworthy or dishonest officers in an
expeditious manner.
I expect to visit this vicinity again
in July and to make a thorough can
vass of the state. 1 am in the race
to stay and believe 1 shall be nom
inated and elected.

in Idaho.
CUDOEIi 1LIU1S
RESPOND PROMPTLY
TO THE GALL
Company G., I. G. N., 65 strong,
left for Boise Wednesday afternoon,
in response to the orders of Governor
Taylor, mobolizing the National Guard
of the state. The state militia will go
to Boise and remain there until taken
in charge by the United States which,
it is presumed will be done July 1st.
Captain D. F. Banks received word
about midnight Sunday night that
President Wilson had ordered the
mobilization of the National Guard
of all states. Monday ajul Tuesday
were busy days for the officers and
men of the local company. All pVe
parations were complete Tuesday
night and Wednesday afternoon the
company left for Boise.
Troops to Mexican Border.
The National Guard of all the states
will be sent to the Mexican border,
and as rapidly as General Funston
asks for them. Sunday Secretary of
War Baker issued the following state
ment:
"In view of the disturbed condi
tions of the Mexican border and in
order to assure complete protection
for all Americans, the president has
called out substantially all the state
militia and will send them to the bor
der whenever and as fully as General
Funston determines them to be reel
ed for the purpose stated.
If all are not needed an effort will
be made relieve those on duty there
from time to time, so as to distribute
the duty.
"This call for militia is wholly un
related to General Pershing's expedi
tion, and contemplates no additional
entry into Mexico, except as may be
necessary to pursue bandits who at
tempt outrages on American soil.
"The militia are being called out so
as to leave some troops in the several
states. They will'be mobilized at their
home stations, where necessary re
cruiting can be done."
All in Funston's Hands.
General Frederick Funston, com
manding the border forces, will desig
nate the time and place for movement
of guardsmen to the international line
as the occasion shall require.
In announcing the orders, Sec
retary Baker said the state forces
would be employed only to guard
the border, and that no additional
troop movements into Mexico
were contemplated except in pur
suit of raiders.
Simultaneously witUi the national
guard call. Secretary Daniels of the
navy department ordered additional
war vessels to Mexican waters on
both coasts to safeguard American
lives.
At the war, navy and state depart
ments it was stated that no new ad
vices as to the situation in Mexico
had come to precipitate the new
orders. .
Tension Been Increasing.
Within the last two weeks, how
ever, tension has been increasing
steadily. The crisis presented by Gen
eral Carranza's note demanding the
recall of General Pershing's expedi
tionary force has been followed by a
virtual ultimatum served on the Amer
ican officer by General Trevino, the
Mexican commander in Chihuahua.
To this was added Saturday the pos
sibility that Mexican and American
troops had clashed across the border
from San Benito, Tex.
Administration officials made no at
tempt to oonceal Sunday night their
relief over the safe return of Major
Anderson's cavalry squadron to the
American side of the border. The
troopers crossed in pursuit of bandits
' i the face of intimations that they
.. ould be attacked if they did so. Gen
eral Funston himself reported that he
anticipated fighting, presumably with
Carranza troops.
Will Release Regulars.
Mobilization of the national guards
men to support General Funston s
line will pave the way for releasing
some 30,000 regulars for immediate
service in Mexico in the event of
open (hostilities with Ahe Carranza
government. The guardsmen them
selves could not be used beyond he
line without authority of congress and
until they had volunteered for that
duty, as they are called out under
the old militia law. The new law which
would make them available for any
duty under the federal government
goes into effect July 1.
The entire mobile regular army in
the Unitel States, several provisional
regiments of regular coast artillery
serving as infantry and the national
guard of Texas, New Mexico and Ari
zona are now on the border or in
Mexico. Definite figures have never
been mad public, but it is understood
General Funston has about 40,000
regulars and probably 5,000 or more
guardsmen, of whom 10,000 regulars
are with Geneal Pershing or scatter
ed along his line of communication
from Namiquipa, Mex., to Columbus,
N. M. .
Company G in Fine Shape
Company G recently underwent an
inspection by Major Tukey, Major
Jefferies and Sergt. Bruce and not a
man was turned down. Major i ukey
at this time, June 5th, expressed him
self as highly pleased with men and
congratulated them and their officers
upon the splendid physical condition
of the company.
Mrs. R. A. Harmon entertained at
Kensington Monday afternoon. Dainty
refreshments were served. Those pres
ent were Mrs. L. J. Ross, Mrs. C. M.
Ainsworth, Mrs. J. Ben Dunlap. Misses
Margaret Gipson, Edyth Engle and
Ray Olmstead.
MWEOOEOt IS MO
GÜILTY OF MÖRDER
FIRST DEGREE
At 3:30 o'clock yesterday morning
the jury in the case of the State vs.
Hardenburg reached an agreement,
finding him guilty of murder in the
first degree. Hardenburg was sen
tenced to life imprisonment.
This is said to be the first time in
the history of Canyon county when
a verdict of murder in the first de
gree has been found by the jury.
The case was concluded and placed
in the hands of the jury Wednesday
evening at 10:30
During the afternoon Hardenburg
occupied the witness stand in his own
behalf. For 30 minutes he gave di
rect testimony regarding his life and
acts, and for exactly an hour he faced
the searching questions of the prose
cuting attorneys.
Drink Possible Factor
Attempt was not made to prove
Hardenburg insane. The fact that he
had been heavily addicted to drink
was acknowledged by himself and
carefully corroborated by other testi
mony for the defense. That the use
of intoxicants over a long period
"tended to unbalance the defendant's
mind, giving extenuation for the of
fense given through not proving in
sanity" was the keynot of Attorney
Van Duyn's plea for his client.
The element of possible self-de
fense was injected when the défen
dent testified that Richardson draw
ing his hand from behind him start
ed forward with a vile epithet on his
lips a moment before the shots were
fired.
No Denial of Shooting
At no stage of the trial did the de
fense attempt to deny the shooting.
Nor did the prisoner deny that he
had, in the sheriff's office in Cald
well, signed the statement to which
the officers testified and which was
placed in evidence, acknowledged that
he shot Richardson, "with his own
hands."
Excitement was crcated at the morn
ing session when Mrs. Richardson,
widow of the man slain and former
wife of Hardenburg, became hyster
ical at conclusion of her appearance
on the stand.
Defense Starts.
It was 11:25 o'clock when the state
rested in presentation of direct testi
mony. Counsel for the defense waived
privilege of making an opening state
ment. Instead, the first witness was
called to the stand
Sam Perry, a witness for the state
on Tuesday, was first called by At
torney Van Duyn. Through this wit
ness the defense sought to show that
Hardenburg had been extremely rest
less and nervous during the last few
days previous to the shooting Mr.
Perry was in position to throw light
upon the defendant's actions by rea
son of the fact that the two men were
employed by the same shepman, east
of this city and slept together.
That Hardenburg's restlesness
reached a climax on the last evening
he remained at the camp, was Perry's
testimony. On that night, stated the
witness, Hardenburg did not sleep at
all and was continually sitting up in
bed to roll and smoke cigarettes.
Sanity Question el
For the first time directly showing
the intention to inject into the defense
the question of the prisoner's sanity,
Van Duyn asked for Perry's opinion
in the matter. Strenuous objections
of Attorney Griffiths and Stone were
in the end overruled. Answering the
question Perry declared: "I don't
think the man was right at all the last
few days he was at camp.
In cross examination of Perry the
fact was brought out that Hardenburg
talked much during his final nervous
ness; he could understand practically
nothing of what was said. On redirect
examination witness said he did dis
tinguish the name "Ellen" several
times. This, he stated is the given
name of Mrs. Richardson, formerly
Hardenburg's wife.
J. P. Wells, a rancher who had em
ployed Hardenburg during the fall,
and with whom the latter had worked
for his board during part of the win
ter, next testified. He had noticed
acts of the accused man which were
"peculiar." he averred. One of these
acts was a habit Hardenburg had of
always turning sharplv to look out of
the barn door when thev entered to
begin the milking. Another was his
marked abstraction while sitting in
the house after working hours.
Becomes Moody.
Cross-examination of Wells brought
out the fact that it was only after
Hardenburg ceased to receive wages
and was kept indoors by stormy
weather that his air of abstraction be
came pronounced.
W. F. Corn, another rancher who
had employed Hardenburg on his
farm, next took the stand. He had
been a witness for the state. His tes
timony was much the same as that of
Wells. The employe often sat long in
a deep study. Mr. Corn stated. Testi
mony of M. W. Corn, father of W. F.
Com. testified as to relations with
Hardenburg and observation of his
actions.
Addicted to Drink
Through the testimony of James
Riley, former saloon proprietor in
Boise, and acquaintance of Harden
burg, the defense forcibly brought out
a new phase in its contentions. This
was to the effect that the prisoner
used intoxicants to an extent that
might have caused a mental aberra
tion. Riley testified to haviug seen
Hardenburg drink; on one occasion he
observed him "drunk".
Question—Did Hardenburg drink
frequently, or otherwise?
Answer—Frequently.
Question—Heavily or otherwise?
Answer—I can hardly say as to
that.
Question—What could you say as
to having seen him drunk?
Answed-—Can't say that I ever saw
him intoxicated except once
Sanitarium Incidents
Along the same linet, and for the
same purpose, the defense next put on
the stand F. M. Carson of Boise, once
in charge of a sanitarium where treat
ment for liquor cure was given, the
testimony showed. Asked who had
put Hardenburg in care of his sani
tarium, Mr. Carson stated that the
wife, when still Mrs. Harder, had
done so. Later, after she had become
ulwllll
Mrs. Hardenburg by marriage, Carson
stated, she again accompanied the de
fendant to the sanitarium.
At this point deposition of a brother
of the prisoner, Guy Hardenburg of
Fort Lupton, Colo., and a statement
from a brother-in-law, A. W. Howel,
Longmont, Colo., were admitted.
They declared that he had been of a
morose disposition and addicted to
drink. The same points were empha
sized in a deposition by Frank Rick
ard, a transfer man for whom Har
denburg had worked at Longmount.
Prisoner on Stand.
Hardenburg took the stand in his
own defense at 3:50. His youth was
touched upon, again to bring out the
fact that he acquired the liquor habit
quite early in his life. He was married
to Mrs. Harder on January 1, 1912,
at Boulder, Colo., he stated. Up to
the time he lived in Boise, the defen
dant testified that he had "used liquor
all the time."
Reference to the wife's alleged re
marks to the effect that other men
would be more acceptable to her was
put into the records after sundry ob
jections and arguments. Though in
Boise at» the time their divorce pro
ceedings were heard, Hardenburg
stated that he had made no appear
ance in court.
Questioned quite briefly about the
shooting the accused man stated: "I
went there to stop him from talking
about me and ask Mrs. Richardson
about a relinquishment to a home
stead."
Personal Threat Made
The element of self defense was in
jected when Hardenburg stated that
as Richardson came out of the house
after having gone into see if the wo
men "wanted to buy any soap," the
rancher suddenly drew his hand from
behind him at the same time uttering
the first ssyllable of a vile epithet.
"Then I shot,' Hardenburg told the
jury.
The prisoner testified that he was
not conscious of what he did imme
diately following the shooting. He
acknowledged that he may have hit
Miss Brooks over the head, but did
not remember doing so. He admitted
that he had signed the statement tan
tamount to a confession, following his
(Continued on last page).
OUSTER PROCEEDINGS
STARTED AGAINST
Upon the information filed by C. B.
Ross, chairman of the board of county
commisioners, at 1 o'clock Wednesday
afternoon, A. O. Christopher, until that
moment county assessor, was promptly
cited to appear before Judge Bryan
in district court at 10 a. m., June
27, to make answer. Judge Bryan is
sued the order early in the afternoon.
The judge's citation served upon
the defendant asks that he appear
"to answer upon information of the
plaintiff for charging and collecting
illegal fees and for refusing and ne
glecting to perform the official duties"
pertaining to his office.
Ouster Proceedings
The ouster proceedings consist of
an action entitled "C. B. Ross vs. A.
O. Christopher, as assessor of the
Canyon county, Idaho.' It is based
upon provisions of section 7459 of
the revised codes and chapter 58 of
the 1913 session laws.
Allegation that the assessor has
neglected his official duties is based
upon the claim that he failed to settle
with the county auditor for moneys
collected on the current personal as
sessment roll, on the first Monday of
May'and the first Monday of June, as
the statute requires. Fourteen small
items of expense for such things as
telephone service, gasoline and mo
torcycle repairs are alleged to have
heen twice paid, in the portion of the
complaint relative to collection of "il
legal" fees. The total amount is less
than $100.
Madden in Charge.
Coincident with the filing of the re
moval suit, the office of assessor be
came'vacant. By prearangement of
the commissioners, R. S. Madden of
this city was immediately placed in
charge of the office. Madden's bond
had been prepared and approved dur
ing the morning.
Mr. Christopher did not appear at
the courthouse during the morning,
but in the afternoon assisted in get
ting Mr. Madden installed in the office.
Penalty Sought
After asking that the court enter
judgment depriving Mr. Christopher
of the office permanently, the prayer
of the complaint uses this language:
"That he pay $500 as provided in sec
ti'on 7459 of the Idaho revised codes,
and costs, and forfeit for the use of
Canyon county the sum of $1000 as
provided by chapter 58 of the session
laws of the state of Idaho, 1913, and
such other relief as to the court shall
seem proper."
