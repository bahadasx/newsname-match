Clash-flit Carrizal Has Gravely Strained Relations With
i. de Facto Authorities of Mexico
ADMINISTRATION AWAITING OFFICIAL REPORT
All Information So Far Has Come From Mexican Sources -,
General Pershing is Making Every Effort to Get Word
From the Detachment of Tenth Cavalry Believed to Have
Been Engaged at Carrizal No Steps Toward Reprisal
. Will be Taken Until Pershing's Report Has Been Care
fully Considered First Step Would be to Demand the
Release of the .Seventeen American Troopers Now In

States government and the de facto
authorities of Mexico hope to treat
the clash at Carrizal yesterday as an
Incident aggravating gravely strained
f relations but not of itself likely to
precipitate general hostilities.
Administration Awaiting Report. :.
: So far as the Washington adminis
tration is concerned, no final decision
can be reached until President Wil
son has received a report on the fight
from American army officers. All in
formation so far has come from Mexi-
. can sources. ,
General Pershing , is making every
effort -to get -word from- the detach
ment of the Tenth Cavalry believed to
- have been engaged at Carrizal.
A despatch from General Funston
late today said Pershing had heard of
the affair only through reports from
Held headquarters. Cavalry started
immediately to get in touch with the
detachment which is supposed to be
returning toward the field base at Co-
Jonia Dublan, more than sixty miles
rom the scene of the fighting. , -
Preparations for Possible Waiv
Events ' moved ' swiftly here " during
the day. Preparations by the war de
' partment for possible '" war with " the
Mexican government went, forward
without interruption. At the same
time there came hints that General
Carranza had been almost Dersuaded
by European influences -not to persist
in a course certain to bring on a conflict-
" "
) Hopeful of Peaceful . Outcome.
It is known, that many officials here
have not abandoned hope of a peace
ful outcome, although they admit that
. each day since the present friction be
gan has seen new clouds gather. Their
hopes against war are based solely on
, the reports that have reached them in
directly that the Carranza government
Is inclined to seek a peaceful way out
J - No Doubt of Casualties.
The Carrizal incident " of course,
overshadows now all other develop
ments. Although they have only Mex
(ican reports to go upon, officials do
;not question statements that many
American cavalrymen were killed
wounded or captured. In view of the
orders given American commanders in
Mexico, however, they refute the
charge that the commander of the de
tachment was the aggressor.
Whatever the facts may prove -to be

Both cases have been officially railed
to the attention of the TTnited States

DUTCH ARE BEING
EXPELLED FROM ODESSA
Unless They Can Prove Their Non
" German Origin.
Amsterdam. Netherlands, June 22.
A part of the population of Odessa, on
the Black Sea, who are of Dutch de
scent, are said to be In great danger
of eviction by the Russian govern
ment unless they can prove their non
German origin. A population of 80,
000 is involved, and they have just ap
plied for help to Dutch authorities in
confirming the facts of the case. Their
history is a romantic one, dating back
two centuries.
A considerable number of members
of the Anabaptist or Mennonite sect
left their homes in the northern Dutch
province of. Friesland In the seven
teenth century for Germany in order
to escape the - persecution to -which
they were subjected. Establishing
themselves in West Pmssia,they grad
ually spread .along the entire Lower
Vistula river, even into Poland, being
apparently In their own water-ridden
country. -
Frederick TL (1740-86) wanted to
force them Into military service for
his many wars, which was against the
principles of the Anabaptists. A num
ber of them therefore accented th in
vitation of Catharine 11. of Russia to
seme in her newly acquired territory
to the north of the Black Sea, and es-
taoiisnea themselves in the environs
of Odessa and In the town itself. Here
apparently they prospered and multiplied,-
