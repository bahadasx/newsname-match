Advices in Washington Re
port Great Activity—
Hope to Hurt Allies.
Washington, June 2t.—Advices re
ceived here from Mexico allege that
the German representatives there
have encouraged General Carranza
and the officers of the defacto gov
ernment in their opposition to United
States troops remaining in that coun
try. The form of encouragement was
said to have been moral rather than
material.
The reports further declare that
German citizens in Mexico are being
treated with great consideration, their
property not being molested. Some
Americans have taken advantage of
the favors accorded German subjects
by placing their property in the hands
of German friends upon leaving Mexi
co.
This information was disclosed by a
competent authority in connection
with Information concerning the ac
tivity in Mexican affairs of Captain
Fran* von Rlntelen, now under indict
ment in New York for conspiracy to
foment sjtrikes in American munitions
piantl, and under arrest In England.
von Rintelen. is known by the au
thority. mentioned aa .well.
am -h*. y
ermifent officials to .have been most
la M*xlcan amirs. His activi
ties began at the time Villa and Car
rania were at odds and when Huerta
went to the border to direct a plot to
gain control of the government. Von
Rintelen was described as having been
prompted by three motives in endeav
oring to stir up trouble between the
United States and Mexico, although
primarily- his activities were said to
have-been directed against the entente
allies and not against the United
States.
The information obtained leads of
ficials to believe that von Rintelen
thought that by starting a dispute be
tween the United States and Mexico,
munition shipments from America
would be stopped that the United
States would be too busy to pursue
the submarine controversy, and that
the allied navies would be prevented
from securing fuel oil and gasoline
from the Mexican fields. More than
60 per cent of the oil used in the
British navy oomee from Mexico.
It was pointed out that at no time
would the United States have failed
to press its demands in regard to the
conduct of submarine warfare, even
if a state of war existed with Mexico.
As for exportation of oil. from the
Mexican fields, it was said that in the.
event of war between the United
States and Mexico, some means will
be found to prevent the plans of von
Rintelen from being realized.
The names of Frederico Stallforth
of New York, a former banker in
Mexioo, and Andrew C. Meloy, also of
New York, are mentioned in connec
tion with that of von Rintelen. Stall
forth, who was said to have been as
sociated-with von Rintelen lit Mexico,
was called before the federal grand
jury in New York to testfly as to his
activities. Von Rintelen, while in this
country,? maintained headquarters in
Stallforth'e off ices. He is understood to
have denied any connection with Mex
ican Intrigues! but was remanded to
Jail. over night for contempt for re
fusing, to answer certain questions be
fore the jury.
Another name mentioned with von
Rintelen's was that of David Lamar,
sometimes called "The Wolf of Wall
Street," and Indicted with him. Lamar
is said here to have obtained-a large
sum of money from vori Rintelen to
be used in promoting certain plans
regarding Mexioo, and dock strikes in
New York.

Petrograd, June 2S. (via London)—
The loss of life on the steamer Mer
cury, sunk by a mine in the Black
Sea, undoubtedly is large from late
reports. The Mercury was traveling
from Odessa to Kherson with 800
passengers, including a number of
students. Two miles from shore the
vessel struck a mine. A rough sea
prevented the launching of all but
two life boats. However, many pas
sengers who could swim clung to bits
of wreckage, floating to points of res

New York, June 23.—In the event
of war between the United States and

Cb. and MachinefGun Co.
Nearly Double/! in
V-u-l Numbers/
Since the members of Company M.,
N.. D.: N. G., were placed under gov
ernmental orders and a call issued for
recruits, the size of the local militia
has been swelled considerably arid
now numbers over 80 men, with more
joining dally, according to Captain A.
G. Wlneman.
The full war strength of Company
M. is classified at 150 men, and it is
expected that this number will be
reached within a few weeks. A re
cruiting station will remain open here
after the present squad has departed
for the border, and as rapidly as
members are taken in and drilled,
they will be shipped to the border for
.service.
According to Oaptaln A. G- Wine
man, only three members of Company
M. were discharged from duty, and
will not make the trip to Mexico.
These men are married and are de
pended upon for the support of fam
ilies.
The machine gun company, which
has recruiting headquarters at the of
fice of Captain L. L. Eckman. Is also
increasing In numbers rapidly and
now boasts of over 50 members, over
double the number of which it was
formerly comprised. The Machine
Gun company is considered an attrac
tive department in which to be classi
fied and recruits are seeking enlist
ment even more rapidly than into the
militia.
Many young men of the city have
applied for enlistment, who have been
refused, due to parental objection,
physical deficiency or age. The ma
jority applying have faced no objec
tionable circumstances.

Washington, June 23.—Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of I^abor, telegraphed la

that American labor would do all it
could to prevent a break between the
two countries. The message went T- „.i_
forward after Mr. Gompers had seen
delegates from Yucatan labor organ

between labor representatives of the
two countries.
A conference had been set for June
25, but Mr. Gompers told the Mexi

El Paso, June 23.—American
guns command the situation at ev

Field artillery is mounted- on htl«
locks in the larger communities,
the noses of their guns pointing in
a southerly direction, while in the
smaller towns machine gun detach

possible hostilities.
After waiting 48 hours, the. bor
der read the news dispatches giv
ing Uie American version of the
fight at. Carrizal, containing
ing's report that it was an unpro
voked attack upon the Americans,
and. then, lapsed into expectant
