ASSESSORS ROOST KKAL
ESTATE yALTIES SKYWAKI)
Real estate values In Lincoln coun
ty and In North Platto -havo been boost
ed skyward as compared with tho val
ues made four yeaTS ago. This ad
vance ranges from ten to ono foun
dered per cent, and In some Instances
the values placed on tho property Is
twenty percent higher than tho prop
erty has sold for within tho past year.
Generally speaking there Is great
Inequality In tho ascesment, and par
ticularly Is this true In North Platto
the assessors apparently In many In
stances at least paying but little at
tention to what should constltuto val
ue. There are many Instances whore
a corner lot the house and lot is list
ed separately Is assessed tho same
as an Insldo lot, when as everyone
knows a corner lot always sells for
ten to twenty per cent nioro than an
Inside lot. There are Instances where
property costing ?8,000 Is listed the
same as that costing $G,000 whore the
location of ono does not possess ad
vantages over another Some farm
land In the valley lias been 'advanced
to a value much hlghor than it would
sell in tho open market and this lat
ter Is tho true valuation of all prop
perty. During tho past three days tho coun
ty commissioners have been sitting
as a board iof equalization and their
room In the court) house has 'been be
selged with those anxious to learn tho
values placed on their property. So
far wo have failed to moet one man
who is satisfied. The dissatisfaction
generally speaking is due to tho In
equalities. Tho commissioners - will, however,
go over tho assessors' books and cor
rect, at least some of the most glar
ing Trrors, and when they hayo com
pleted this work they twill again git
as a board of equalization and the
property owner can appear and make
protest if he considers the readjusted
values unU3t.
A town the slzo of North Platte will
never have an equal ahd Just assess
ment until tho .work Is delegated to
ono man, and. by having ono mean he
can study Jhe true value of property
and not go at It In a hapliazerdway.

Sutherland Chautauqua Called Off
Tho Sutherland Chnutnuquo, which
-: :nt
was to havo opened today has been
called off. Tho reason for this ac
tion was tho prevalence of diphtheria
in tho Sutherland neighborhood. Tho
flrce Lance Says:
"While there was. a possibility of
no further spread of tho disease on
ncount of tho several session of the
entertainment booked, it wnB thought
best to tako no ' chances hehco tho
cancellation. Anyhow, there was some
likelihood that the ' attendance would
bo curtailed on account of tho fear of
contngion." .
