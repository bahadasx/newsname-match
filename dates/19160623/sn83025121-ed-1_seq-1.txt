clianL'e of attitude toward thie couutry
liv the du facto government ia due to
tin" influence of German plotter who
have been at work for month bring
iue; pressure to bear upon Carranxa.
It is alleged that German representa
tives nt the heudipmrtera of the Car
ranxa faction, have been encouragiii.'
hi in in bis stand against tbe 'United
states, and in his opposition to the
demands made by the Washington ad
ministration.
It is also asserted that the Germans
in Mexico are now enjoying unusual
treiitineut. Tboy are meeting with
every consideration from the Mexican
ollieials, and are moving about their
liusiues without molestation of any
sort.
In the despatches, connection be
tween the alleged plot to bring about
ar between the United States and
Mexico, and the so-culled munitions
plants plots in the United Mates is
drawn. Franz von Hintelen, now un

complicity with the munition plant
