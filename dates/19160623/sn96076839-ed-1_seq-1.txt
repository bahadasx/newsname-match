ENTIRE NATIONAL GUARD
ORDERED INTO SERVICE
EVERY STATE IN THE UNION REQUIRED TO
FURNISH ITS QUOTA.
Company "I," 33d Inf., On Duty
EXPECTS TO BE ORDERED TO GRAYLING
STATE CAMP BY SUNDAY.
Holding Drills Daily and
At Frequent
Captain Henry L. Winters, command
ing Company T 33rd M. N. G., was
at the Company's office in the Armory
Monday morning going over some
routine work, and peacefully dreaming
of the bumper crops the farm would
yield this summer. A telegram was
handed him from Lansing. It was in
cipher from Military Headquarters and
jjwhen read it spelled "M0BL1ZE."
And since that hour it has been
hustle and work for the officers and
privates of Company "I." Before
nightfall the peace-strength of the
Company had reported for duty, and
the several members outside the city
were hurriedly arranging their business
affairs and on their way to this city.
Several drills are being held daily
and the members of the Company are
in touch with the Armory at all times.
As yet no marching orders have been
received but it is hourly expected that
our boys will be ordered to the State
Camp at Grayling before Sunday. That
our citizens may know when the orders
have been received the fire whistle
will be given four long blasts and re
peat in three minutes.
Since Company "I" was sworn in,
East Jordan has been the proud pos
sessor of the largest military unit in
in the State of Michigan, and in the
smallest city or the state having a Na
tional Guard organization. In Company
"1" is represented more business and
professional men, mechanics and
laborers in proportion to population
than any other city in the State.
And we, as citizens, are proud of the
fact that we have in our midst so many
patriotic and unselfish men who are
willing to place themselves at their
country's call to sacrifice their busi
ness and home interests and be ready
for any emergency that our country
might demand.
The forces Michigan is required to
I furnish are: One brigade of three
regiments of infantry, two troops of
cavalry, two batteries of field artillery,
one company engineers, one company
signal corps, one field hospital and two
ambulance companies. The Michigan
contingent is to assemble at Grayling.
Michigan's infantry is located as fol
lows: Thirty-first regiment, Colonel
Walter Harlow, Detroit, composed of
companies A, 11, C, D, E, F, G, H, all of
Detroit, Co. I, Ann Arbor; Co. K,
Monroe; Co. L, and Co. M, of Jackson.
Thirty-second infantry, Colonel Louis
C. Covell, Grand Rapids," and the fol
lowing companies: A, of Coldwater;
B, of Adrian; C. and D, of Kalamazoo;
E, of Ionia; F, of Grand Haven; G, of
Muskegon; II, of big Rapids, and I, K,
L and M, of Grand Rapids.
Thirty-tnird infantry, Colonel John
B. Boucher, Cheboygan, and the fol
lowing companies: A, or Flint; B, of
Bay City; C, of Port Huron; D, of
Alpena; E, of Pontiac; F, of Saginaw;
G, of Houghton; II, of Owosso; K, of
Cheboygan; L, of Menominee; M, of
the Soo; and I, of Kast Jordan.
Michigan also has one corps of
engineers, Co. A, at Calumet; one
company A of signal corps, at Ypsi
lanti; two cavalry troops, Troop A, at
South Haven, and Troop B, at Detroit,
and two batteries, A and B, of field
artillery, at Lansing.
Michigan has too, two battalions of
naval reserves, the nearest being at
Traverse City.
Secretary Baker issued the following
statement:
"In view of the disturbed conditions
on the Mexican border and in order to
assure complete protection for all
Americans, the president has called out
substantially all the atate militia and
will send them to the border, where
ever and as fully as General Funston
determines them to be needed for the
purposes stated.
Reporting at the Armory
Intervals.
WILL DISTRIBUTE DUTY.
"If all are not needed an effort will
be made to relieve those on duty there
from time to time so as to distribute
the duty.
"This call for militia is wholly un
related to General Pershing's expedi
tion and contemplates no additional
entry into Mexico, except as may be
necessary to pursue bandits who at
tempt outrages on American soil.
"The militia are being called out so
as to leave some troops in the several
states. They will be mobilized at their
home stations where necessary recruit
ing can be done."

PETOSKEY MEN TO
JOIN COMPANY K
A telegram came at 3 o'clock Tues
day from Mayor C. S. Reilley, of Che
boygan, asking how many men
Petoskey would have to send to the
front with company K, Thirty-third
Michigan infantry, National Guards.
The telegram said company K had
been called to the front and that the
men accepted in this enlistment would
probably soon see service.
Mayor Klise is out of the city but City
Clerk Niles states that no doubt several
good men would enlist from Petoskey
if they thought there was any chance
of their going to Mexico at once.

CHARLEVOIX BOY
ELECTROCUTED
ON ARC LAMP CHAIN
Philo Burns, a Charlevoix youth, was
electrocuted Sunday evening at the
intersection of Antrim street and the
state road when he leaped up and
grabbed the arc lamp chain in an effort
to shake the light and thus make it
burn more smoothly.
Burns was in that section of the city
in the late evening and seeing the lamp
sputtering decided he might shake it
as he had seen the city electrician do
and make it burn smoothly and bright
ly. He little realized the chain was
grounded to the lamp and never knew
what killed him. He was dead the
second he touched the chain for the
full force of the strong electrical
current passed through his body.
When a man tells a rich widow that
she is all the world to him he may be
trying to work the world for a living.
ROAD BEE DAY
JUNE 29 AND 30
Governor Ferris Issues Proc
lamation for Same.
On June 4th and 5th, 1914, and June
10th and 11th, 1915, Road Bee Days
were observed in Michigan. Much
good to the rural highways was ac
complished on these days, the amount
of good depending entirely upon the
efforts put forth in the various com
munities. Bad weather interfered
seriously with work the first year and
many complaints were received that
the dates set were too early. In many
neighborhoods Road Bee Days were
observed later. This being a proverbial
ly "late season," the time has been set
"after planting" and "before harvest"
in the hope that good weather may pre
vail and the opportune time selected.
During the past year road building
sentiment in Michigan has grown rapid
ly. The Legislature of 1915 passed some
of the most progressive highway laws
ever enacted in Michigan. These were
followed by the largest cash appropria
tions ever made for state road purposes
the appropriations for two years, in
cluding the State's porfion of the auto
mobile taxes, aggregating three millions
of dollars. Already under the Assess
ment District Road Act, petitions have
been filed with the various County
Road Commissioners and the State
Highway Commissioner, for more than
one thousand miles of road which will
cost more than five millions of dollars
to build.
In the aggregate the road taxes
assessed last Fall by the State, Counties
and Townships, amounted to $9,104,009.
Many personal donations were made
which would make a grand total ex
pended on the highways of the State
last year, approximately $10,000,000.
The mileage or State reward roads
completed was the greatest on record.
If connected they would make more
than three continuous lines across the
State from the Ohio line to the Straits
of Mackinaw.
But notwithstanding this apparently
satisfactory progress in substantial
road building, there are thousands of
miles of neighborhood roads which
need attention, not alone annually but
almost constantly throughout the sea
son. Good churches and good rural
schools are impossible without good
roads, and all call for a live community
interest and a well organized system of
maintenance.
Knowing that well kept public wagon
roads are vital to the moral and physi
cal well-being of every community, and
that the people of Michigan are anxious
to extend the work of road improve
ment so as to include all of our road
mileage, and believing that specially
appointed road days are a great stimu
lus to the work, I Woodbridge N. Fer
ris, Governor of Michigan, do ask that
the people of the State of Michigan set
apart Thursday and Friday, June 29th
and 30th, 1910, as "Road Bee Days,"
and so far as possible turn out and
work under such competent super
vision as may be available on the high
ways of the State in such manner as
shall be most conducive to their better
ment. Given under my hand and the Great
Seal of the State this nineteenth day of
June, in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred sixteen, and of
the Commonwealth the eightieth.
WOODBRIDGE N. FERRIS,
Governor.
GEO. II. VAN PELT TALKS
ABOUT GOOD ROADS
Van Pelt claims that it is an absolute
waste of money to build a nine foot
road as we are building them today.
He firmly believes that we have as
good road commissioners as any county
has and that the roads that we are
building now will compare favorably
with any of the same kind that are
built anywhere. He motors a great
deal and has an opportunity of seeing
what is being done in different parts of
the country. He is one of the Good
Roads Committee of the Chicago
Association of Commerce and also on
the Sub-Committee of the Chicago
Detroit Highway Association and work
ing in coneection with the West Michi
gan Pike and Dixie Highway Associa
tion. He ought to know something
about durable roads, because he meets
big, practical road builders.
Chicago is brilding thirty miles -of
concrete road this year to connect with
the old roads laid out at an early date
to reach Chicago.
He doesn't claim to be any smarter
than anybody else and is simply trying
to give those who know nothing at all
about the building of concrete roads
the benefit of the experience he has
gleaned in coming in daily contact with
people who know.

Farewell Demonstration
This Friday Evening
A committee of our citizens appointed by Mayor
A. E. Cross has arranged for a farewell demonstration
for Company I, our representative in the M. N. G., to be
held Friday evening. The program will be given from
the band stand, corner of Esterly and Main streets, at
commencing at eight o'clock.
The program will consist of short talks by a num
ber of our citizens, by Capt. Willard A. Smith of Char
levoix, a response for the Company by Lieut. W. C.
Spring and musical numbers by the High School Band
and a male quartet.
LITTLE GIRL KILLED
BY LIGHTNING
A shocking tragedy occurred late last
Saturday afternoon on the farm of John
Ferris, three miles north of Vanderbilt
when little Margaret McDermott was
struck and instantly killed by a bolt of
lightening.
The little girl was sent across the
fields to call her grandfather, John
Ferris, to supper. Accompanied by
her dog, she performed the mission,
and as a storm was approaching, was
admonished by Mr. Ferris not to wait
for him but to hurry back to the house.
The little girl and the dog started back
to the house, but after a short time the
dog returned to Mr. Ferris and began
to whine and act very strangely. Fol
lowing the dog, Mr. Ferris soon came
upon the sad sight of the little girl half
buried in the sand of the freshly tilled
field, life already extinct and the body
terribly burned.
Margaret McDermott was the daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur McDermott,
but since the death of her mother five
years ago, has made her home with
Mr. and Mrs. Ferris. She was ten
years old. Gaylord Advance.

A PROTECTIVE TARIFF
Even its enemies admit that a pro
tective tariff is a constructive measure.
Their pretended criticism is that it
builds up large business enterprises at
the expense of the masses of the
people. Their pretended sympathy is
for the "ultimate consumer", who, in
their view, pays the tariff duties. The
fact is, however, that no man can have
employment unless there be some one
to conduct an industry or buy the
product. We cannot have large forces
of employes unless we also have large
DDE
J
institutions engaged in production.
Neither can we have large manufactur
ing institutions unless we have a large
purchasing community to consume the
products. Unless we have a protective
tariff, the producers of other countries,
where lower standards of living pre
vail, ship their cheaper products here
and sell them to our people, thus de
priving our producers of their home
market. Every time one of our manu
facturing establishments closes its
doors or cuts down its production, it
throws out of employment a certain
number of wage earners, who, because
of loss of employment, ceases to be
consumers. Diminished consumption
causes further cessation of production,
more unemployment, and, in turn, still
further diminution of consumption. It
is either an endless chain of increased
production or an endless chain of de
crease. The protective tariff is a con
structive measure because it inevitably
builds up our producing industries.
The protective tariff is the peculiar
principle of the Republican party. It
is an "America First" principle. It
ought not be a political question, but
by trying to tear down this bulwark of
American productive industry, the
Democrats have forced the issue. Men
who belieye in "America First" are
not going to give up, so the tariff will
be a party issue until the Democrats
concede the soundness of the protective
principle.
FILM VERSION OF
REX BEACH'S
MOST FAMOUS STORY
The film version of Rex Beach's
"THE NE'ER-DO-WELL" will be
shown at the Temple Theatre, next
week Thursday and Friday, June 29-30.
The picture was produced by the
Selig Polyscope Company, of Chicago,
and is one of the most remarkable
moving pictures ever staged. Although
it takes fully two and one-half hours to
run, there is not a scene that could be
elminated without detriment to the
continuity of the picture.
The acts are swift and full of inci
dent, the exciting episodes numerous;
and the tension does not let down in
between times, as is the case with most
pictures that we see on the screen.
A large and complete cast is headed
by Kathlyn Williams and Wheeler Oak
man, and the entire company which
made "The Spoilers" famous.
In order to acquire the requisite at
mosphere, the eatire company spent
several months in Panama, and the re
sult has proved well worth the trouble
and expense.
The exterior scenes are striking and
beautiful, and at all times there is the
interest of a strange country, people
and customs.
