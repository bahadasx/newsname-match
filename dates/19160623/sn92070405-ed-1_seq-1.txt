Buy Martin Outfit, Including Kanrhcs
And Range
The extensive cattle nnd ranch in
terests of Harry Martin in western
Grant county changed hands this
week. Messrs. Meims nnd Kvans,
wealthy cattlemen of Valentine, Tex.,
take over the Marlin outfit, lock, stock
and barrel. The Martin interests are
among the largest in New Mexico and
the southwest and comprise many
thousand head of cattle and thousands
of acres of ranches, range and leased
land. Mr. Martin has but recently
added to his holdings by the acquisi
tion of twenty-five thousand acres of
state land.
The deal involves many hundreds
of thousands of dollars and is one ot
the biggest cattle deals that has been
recorded in the state in many years.
Mr. Martin, who founded the busi
ness twenty-eight years ago, has
built lip an unusually large and ably
managed industry advantageously lo
cated and considered by experienced
cowmen one of the best in the west.
The location is considered favorable
owing to, its isolation and comparative
freedom from conflicting interests and
the condition of the range itself, nev
er having under Mr. Martin's manage
ment been over-stocked. It is also
unusually watered.
Mr. Martin will take a much de
served vacation after twenty-eight
years of continuous service and may
spend part of the time in travel.

MI
ACTIVITY IN
85 CAMP
Company Buys Big DcíhcI Engine.
linking Below 450 Level
A purchase that evidnces pros
perity and mining activity in the
local district was made this week
when A. J. Interrieden, manager of
the company now in the east, or
dered for shipment another Lyons-
Atlas Deisel engine, an exact du
plicate of the one now installed in
the power plant.
The new engine will be 450 h. p.
and is to be installed in the power
house in the pit east of the Deisel
engine now operating. When the
new big engine is installed the 85
Mining Company will be ready for
any emergencies and will possibly
never again be forced to suspend
operations temporarily for engine
repairs. It will give the company
adequate power for extensive fut
ure development at all parts of the
mine and bears witness to the fact
that the big camp to the south of
Lordsburg is there to stay.
The engine will be brought di
rect to the power house door by
rail. Many of the people in this
section will remember the obsta
cles encountered when the first
unit was moved from the railroad
up to the power house. It was a
memorial event with monuments
in the form of broken wagons,
wheels and axles still blazing the
trail.
George W. Stephenson, represen
tative of the Lyons-Atlas Deisel
Engine Company of Indianapolis,
Ind., who has been here for some
time past in the interest of the first
unit of the mine, will have charge
of the installation of the new en
gine. He recently installed one of
his company 8 engines in the elec
trie light plant at Yuma, Arizona,
coming from there to this city. Mr.
Stephenson is one of the Lyons
Atlas' best engineers, having been
put on some of their largest con
signments.
J. H. Clark is master mechanic at
the 85 mine and will be the bus
iestman in camp when the new en
gine arrives and Art Biersack will
run him a close second.
Sinking at 550 Level.
The 85 company has completed
the sinking of the lower level from
the 450 to the 550 depth p.nd is pre
paring to cut a station, after which
drifting and cross cutting will be
done in blocking out their ore bod
ies and giving them a greater work
ing capacity.
TESTING FOR
CONCENTRATION
Extensive tests are being made
in flotation and the wet process of
concentrating the ores of the 85
mine and if successful there are
possibilities that a treatment plant
will be erected at the camp. It is
believed that the sulphide ores on
the lower levels will be susceptible
to some form of flotation.
SELL NEVADA LEASE
Ev Harris and Dr. Spence sold
their lease on the Nevada claim
from the 85 Mining Company, to
Walter Interrieden and C. Tread
way last week. The Nevada lease
has been one of the most profitable
at the 85 camp and has been devel
oped into a paying proposition by
the recent operators. A large ton
nage of ore has been shipped from
the mine which has netted a neat
income. It is understood that the
remuneration for the lease was in
the vicinity of $3000.
Owing to the inability of the
smelters to take care of their ore
Messrs. Harris and Spence deemed
it advisable to dispose of the lease.
The new operators will continue
mining at the Nevada and will
doubtless make it one of the best
propositions in the camp.
BIDS WANTED.
Sealed bids will be received at
the office of the clerk of the Board
of Trustees of the Lordsburg Pub
lic School until 4 o clock p. m., Ju
lv 1. 1916. for the erection or a
high school building. Plans and
specifications may be had upon ap
plication to R. B. Ownby. Bids
must be accompanied by a bond to
three-fourths the amount of bid.
The board reserves the right to re
ject any and all bids.

CONSTABLE FIRED UPON IN
MAKING ARREST.
Lordsburg was aroused to a state
of tense excitement Saturday night
when Constable Oscar Allen was
fired upon by a Mexican whom he
was arresting. It is estimated
that over a hundred nrmd citizens
rushed to the scene of action, north
of the Southern Paccific tracks,
within ten minutes after the first
shot was fired.
Saturday evening John Augus
tine reported to the officers that
his Chevrolet car was missing. A
search was made and revealed the
fact that two men were seen with
the car in the Mexican settlement.
The car was located and Constable
Allen hailed the driver who was
leaving the car and entering a
house in the rear of the Surprise
grocery. In answer to the officer's
call the Mexican opened fire upon
him. Constable Allen retaliated
for the shots and the man, who was
later identified as Manuel Várela,
rushed into the house. Guards
were left on. the scene and Consta
ble Allen returned with a shot gun.
Varela's room was broken into and
one, Max Evada, was found therein
armed with three revolvers. Eva
da was placed under arrest. One
of the spectators fired a shot dur
ing the arrest, alleging that he was
shot at by a man fleeing from the
rear of one of the buildings.
A search was made for Várela
and on Monday he was found a
short distance from Bowie by Con
stable Allen, who, with Special of
ficer Walters of the S. P. made the
trip by freight. Várela was lodged
in the local jail awaiting a prelimi
nary hearing. When captured he
had in his possession two bottles of
Nervine for your nerves. It is
likely that this tonic will be needed
before the state has finished the
case.
Organize rifle club here
t All citizens who have signed up
to become members of the Lords
burg Rifle Club, a branch of the
National Rifle Club, are requested
to meet at the S. P. waiting room
Thursday evening to organize

pay their dues or purchase a rifle.
The rifles will be sold by the gov
ernment at $5.00 plus packing and

organization is a most worthy one
and should be heartily supported
by the people of tins community
PUBLÍOTY FOrToRDSBURG

been sent out from the Western
Liberal office, to newspapers
throughout the southwest, an
abundance of news items and

TO REORGANIZE
CARLISLE COMPANY
Men controlling the Carlisle
Mining Company were visitors at
the property of the Company at
Stccplcrock this week for the pur
pose of inspecting the progress
made at the mine. - Among the vis
itors was San ford Makeever, of
New York City, president of the
company. He left the camp on
Wednesday morning for his home,
where a special meeting of the
Board of Directors is to be held
soon after his arrival there. At
the meeting steps are to be taken
towards making a general reor
ganization of the company and
raising sufficient funds to contin
ue the work begun last year.
The mine has been entirely un
watered and the pumps are now
only required to handle 75 gallons
of water a minute, which is not suf
ficient to even keep the test mill
supplied. More water will have to
be developed to supply the mill.
Manager M. K. Welch, of the
property, was in Duncan on Wed
nesday morning for a short busin
ess visit, at which time he said
that operations at present consist
ed of only necessary work to keep
things moving, but that at an early
date the force of men employed will
be greatlyincreased Duncan News
