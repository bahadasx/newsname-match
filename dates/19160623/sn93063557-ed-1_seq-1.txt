Vermont. No one who saw the little
grandson of Governor Mead tnke the
keya of the chapel acroaa the chancel to
Governor Mead, or who heard the
atudent choir aing "Lift up your Heada,
O ye Gatea," will ever forgot it. Hep
burn Hall, openedon Tuesday, waa the
admiration of every visitor, as it was
rcalized how completo the new dormi
tory is in all its features and how it
would surely increase tho popularity of
the college.
The Regiater haa not space for a com
plete story of this great commence
ment. No attempt is made to narrate
the events in the order of their impor
tance or their happening, and even a
complete report could not convey Ihe
apirit of rejoicing and euthusiasm which
characterized the various gatherings.
THE COMMENCEMENT DINNER.
Every place was taken at the dinner
following the graduation exercises and
many could not aecure admission.
President Thomaa preaided and apoke
of his joy in the prosperity of the col
lege and hia atrong hope for tho future.
Aside from the address of Hon, John
G. Saxe, reported in another column,
Rev. Arthur H. Bradford of Rutland,
who had received the dogree of Doctor
of Divinity, spoke of the strong position
of Middlebury in Vermont and paid a
tribute to Governor Mead. He was
followed byMr. Howard Elliott, who
aaid inpart:
"I wish to expreaa my profound
thanka to the Trusteea of Middlebury
College for the honor conferred on me
today by this, the oldeat college in tho
apparently unlimited natural resources
of our country and the great immigra
tion, we have not thought sufliciently of
conditions that will confront us when
we are compelled to husband our re
sources in order to compete with other
nationa. These conditions now face ua.
We surely can help ourselves it we try
to practico the old-fashioned character
istics that many are pleased to call New
England habits. These characteriatics
and habits are not as prevalent as in
the old days.-traits that built up the
country from the Revolution to the
Civil War, and which I am glad to
know Middlebury College encourages.
"Aa your catalogue points out, the
location of the college favors economy,
a aterling habit that seems to be loat
sight of in this period of extravagance,
due, doubtless, to the great increase in
wealth. We are extravagant as indi
viduals, and our Government, Pderal
State, municipal, and county, rdflects
that spirit. As a result, we are piling
up debts that will be a burden upon
many a county and town, and the State
nnd nation for years to come.
"The college in the country has a
direct inlluencc for sane and economical
living which is an offset to the extrava
gance of tho great cities.
"There ia another habit thnt ia not so
prevalent as formerly the habit of
work. Thoao who made the American
nation what it ia today worked long and
hard. The spirit of hard work now
seema to be lacking and we hear con
stantly that eight hours or lesa work a
day ia all that a strong, healthy man
