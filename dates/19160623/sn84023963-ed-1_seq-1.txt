A half million dollars' worth of
jiiquor has just been confiscated in
Alabama and because public sentiment
is against such action by the state au
thorities, the militia has been placed
in control of the situation at Girard,
a "wide-Open" city. Alabama repealed.
her prohibition law in 1912. In 1915, 1
the legislature made the state ''dry"
again, which accounts for the public
distaste for the "dry" law.
The ensuing is an Associated Press
dispatch from Columbus, Ga., to the
Nashville Tonnesseean:

How many visitors to
Philadelphia remember
that at Valley Forge, a
few minutes' ride from
our city hall, is a
locality fully as
significant in its
historic associa
tions as Lexington?
Here, In the lonely woods of Val
ley Forge, is the spot forever hallowed
where Washington knelt upon the
snow and prayed in the extremity of
despair that the cause of liberty should
yet be successful, says the Philadol
pha Reoofd.
Thousands öf visicors do, indeed,
visit Valley Foree. but many thou-
qulsnlng e 'command oT. the British
army to Lord Corerwallis, evacuated
the city and withdrew to New York.
Through the efforts of the state of
Pennsylvania, Valley Forge is now
public property. More than 400 acres
arc included in the park, comprising
Washington's headquarters, most of?
the campground and the remains of,
the Revolutionary forts and earth-1
works. Altogether the state has ap-;
propriated more than $350,000 for the
reservation of the campsite. Pleas

day after a- special train carrying
twnty-tro 'deputies arrived from
Montgomeo'i ,were discontinued. They
where impenetrable thickets once
grew. The entrenchments and forts
that were concealed in a dense wood
a few years ago are now accessible to
visitors. The fine drives of the park
attract horsemen and automobilists in
great numbers. By the principal road
the ascent of Mount Joy, an elevation
of 500 feet, is made by easy grades,
and from the brow of the hill views
covering 20 miles are obtained.
WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS.
Washington's headquarters, a stone
farmhouse which belonged to Isaac
Potts, a Quaker, stands near the rail
road station, and at the entrance to
the park. It was Isaac Potts who is
said to have seen Washington at pray
er in the icebound woods, at a time
when hope seemed almost gone.
The rooms are today as they were
In Washington's time. The log kitch
en at the rear was built while Wash
ington occupied the house. From it
descends an entrance into what was
a tunnel to the banks of the Schuyl
kill river. Priceless Revolutionary
relics are gathered in the building.
The tent which Washington used on
the field is still preserved.
At this entrance to the park tand3
the beautiful memorial arch o(. stone
built by the nation and completed last
year. It is known as the Washington
Memorial arch, and another, to be
called tne Steuben Memorial arch, is
planned for the other principal en
trances of the park. For beauty and
impressiveness no similar structure ia

of the Washington arch in Washing

Th Old Constitution.
The Constitution originally car
ried forty-four guns. A particular
ly interesting history is connected
with this ship. During the war
with the Barbary powers in 1S03
she was Commodore Preble's flag
ship in the Mediterranean and
played a conspicuous part during
the whole war. Lieutenant Wads
worth, who was blown up betöre
Tripoli in the ill fated Intrepid,
was one of the ofiiccrs of the Con
stitution. In the conre of the war
with England in 181"? the English
; papers laughed at the Constitution
and spoke of her as 4a bundle o
' pine boards sailing under a bit of
striped bunting." But when under
! Captain Hull she captured tho
! English frigate Guerriere, a vessel
I of nearly equal force, the peoplo
who lmd before ridiculed her called
her "one of the stauchest v ess eld
afloat." A few months after this
victory the Constitution, then com
manded by Captain Bainbridge,
compelled one of the finest frigates
in the British navy, the Java, to
strike its colors.

FINE MEMORIAL BUILDINGS.
Other new edifices of surpassing
beauty and dignity are tho group of
memorial buildings erected by popu
lar subscriptions from citizens of ev
ery state. They include the Washing
ton Memorial chapel, the Thanksgiv
ing -tower and the Patriots' hall. Serv
ices are held in the chapel by its rec
tor, the Rev. W. Herbert Burk, who
started tho movement for the erection
of the buildings in 1903. The entire
group of buildings aro of the beautiful
CollOtjiate Gothic type of architecture.
They houso a collection of Revolu
tionary relics and a library of Ameri
cana which is unique. It is estimated
that $200,000 will be needed to com
.plete the structures as planned. Wheni
finished they will constitute a sort of J
Westminster abbey, without compari-
son in the United States for histori
cal associations, a Mecca for all pa
triotic Americans from every part of,
the nation. I
It is estimated that 100,000 visitors
from all over the United States make
a pilgrimage to Valley Forge each ,
year. With the inauguration of Phila
delphia's Greater Fourth of July, sig
nalized by the visit of President WTil-,
son, members of congress and dele-1
gates from each of the thirteen orig-;
inal states of the Union, reat inter-j
est was evident in 1915, when the'
richness of Philadelphia's historic
memories were brought more closely '
to the attention of the whole nation.
Americans from Maine to California
visit Valley Forge. Do the citizens of
Philadelphia realize what an excep
tional opportunity they themselves !
have of spending a memorable after
noon in a place so near at hand, so
crowded with memorials of the most
critical period in American history, so
beautiful in its setting among the
cool, green hills of Chester Valley, so
attractive in every way to the person
who wishes to escape for a day the
city streets?

Glass Polishing.
Glass grjnding is effected by tho
use of emery powder of various de
grees of fineness. But it has been
shown that this grinding cannot be
carried beyond a certain point,
however fine l powder may be used.
In fact, a continuation of it undoes
the work and breaks the surface up
again. The most finely vgrouna
plate, if large lyvnvjigmfied, is shown
to be covered' with tiny ,bits which
no grinding wtfti remove. 'The work
i therefort continued with rouge
csfrried - on a pad of rosin, jiiich
gradually smooths down theJeva
tions between the pits. Hydro
fluoric acid gas corrodes glass very
rapidly, but a weak solution of it
melts away the roughened surface
und leaves a lino polish underneath.
This method is used where very

requires as, for instance, in lensei
