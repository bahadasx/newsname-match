continuing General .Pershing's report
I that It was an unprovoked attack on
the Americans, and then 'lapsed Into

sentiment was that the issue of peace
or war with Mexico hangs upon the

Grave apprehension was shown hese
for the safety of the seventeen Ameri

are hedd by General Trevino in Chi

'tllitles result the .Mexicans will prob
ably attempt to carry out" the threat

With the receipt of General Persh

Further Indication that the Mexicans

consulate from the official Informa

"Cable message from Buenos Aires
says that the papers of that city are
emphatic in their disapproval of any

Prom several of the leading border
ports came reports that an embargo is
to be placed on the export of food

lows the exportation to Mexican towns
of larg«^poif|ignments of food and
other military supplies, and reports

sources, it would mean that from thlr

PERSHING BEND'S REPORT.
Not to Bo Considered as Official Story
of' Carrizal Battle.
Washington, June 28.—A prelimi
nary report from General Pershing on
the iCarrizal fight, based on stories
told (by stragglers, reaching the head
quarters of the American expedition
and on Mexican rumors, was taken to
the White House today by Secretary
Baker.
The secretary said General Pershing
himself did not regard the report as
an official story of what happened, and
indicated that no attempt to decide
the course to be taken toy the United
States would 'be made until a complete
account had jbeen received.
Officials were* worried over the de
lay in getting news from the surviving
officers of the little Tenth cavalry de
tachment which engaged the superior
force of 'Mexicans. General Pershing
said he hope|d to have a report from
the surviving officers by courier dur
ing the day.
The report which went to the White
House today and was afterwards laid
before the cabinet meeting carried the
same story as did the press. dispatches
last night It said that the (Mexicans
opened fire on the American troops af
ter a twenty-minute conference ber
tween Captain Boyd, of Troop C, Tenth
cavalry, and General Gomez, the .Car
ranza commander at Carrizal.
Mexicans Ordered Not to Attack.
Elisea Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador designate, today personally in
formed^-dlplomatic Representatives of
South and Central American republics
.that the Carransa troops in Chihuahua
were under orders not to attack Amer-f
lean troops i}nless the Americans as
sumed the aggressive.
Mr. ^AtvedoMdo ^atea-'lhat -ho acted
on instruction from his foreign office.
When allied whether the warning of
Ghmtt^l Trevino, the Carranza com
mander in Chihuahua, that he would
attack any American force moving
east, west or south, has been rescinded,
he said his Instructions made no men
tion of the matter.
After a ca&inet meeting that lasted
nearly two hours Secretary Lansing
said there had been no change in the
situation and that a report of the Car
rizal Incident still was awaited.
No Call For Volunteers.
Secretary Baker denied rumors of
plans for an immediate call for volun
teers to add to the regular army as a
national guard force. He also said
there, had been no additional orders
over night for troop movements.
Senator Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee, called at the state
department today seeking information.
He said congress would do nothing
that might interfere with the negotia
tions of the state department.
Interest was expressed by war de
partment 'officials 16 the official re
port that, •Francisco Villa was 'at
Escalon, Chihuahua state, negotiating
with the' Carranza government for
amnesty and a 'commission in the
Mexican army.
Seeking American Sympathy.
It was suggested^ in some quarters
that the discrepancy'between the Ar
rendondo version 4f the orders and
General Trevino's action was to bB ex
plained
by
the fact- (hat the .Mexicans
would construe any movement other
than north by the American troops as
an aggressive one.
Mr. Arrendondo's visit' to his Cen
tral and South"' American colleagues
renewed talk of a possibility of offers
of mediation of present and past diffi
culties. The dtate department Indi
cated thalt"it does not want media
tion and does not consider that there
is any need, of "mediation.
'At official headquarters tli'e Ar

Tokio, June 23.—"Of course any claim

sist Mexico with munitions and arms is
ou^ of the' question and absurd," said
Baron Ishitr, foreign minister, to a
correspondent of the Associated Press
today, when asked, for his view on the
Mexican situation. The interview was
sought on account of declarations at
tributed to Mexicans that assurances
had been given from Japan that muni
tions and assistance would be given
Mexico in 6vent of a war with
United States.
"As far as private Japanese compa
nies selling arms to Mexico," he con
tinued, "I consider it Improbable, as.you
know all available rifleg and guns are
being furnished to Japan's allies to as
sist in bringing the European war to a
successful Issue. And I fancy, tho I do*
not know, that munitions not available

commercial, any event bringing disturb

be felt deeply In Japan. "This is es
pecailly true at a moment- when the
whole European trade 'Is virtually
closed to Japan and the Chinese market
is seriously upset."

copy of this gdvejrthment's note of June

of the de facto government of Mexico
on the subject of the presence of
American troops in Mexican territory.
This communication states clearly thu
critical relations existing between thi«
government and the de .faoto govern
ment of Mexico and the causes which
have led up to the^ present situation.
Against Enemy Government.
"Should this situation pventuate Into
hostilities which this government will
deeply regret and will use every hon
orable effort to avoid, I take this op
portunity to inform you that this gov
ernment would have for its object, not
intervention in Mexican affairs with all
the regrettable consequences whicn
might result from such a policy, but
the defense of American territory from
further invasion by bands of armed
Mexicans, protection of American citi
zens and property along the boundary
from outrages- committed by such ban
dits, and the prevention of future dep
redations by force against the maraud
ers infesting this region and against a
government which is encouraging and
aiding them in their activities.
"Hostilities, in short, would be
simply a state of International war
without purpose on the part of the
United States other than to end the
conditions which menace our national
peace apd safety of our citizens."

I get home we will take the lid off."
By No. 3, after the summer vacation
Orpet addressed here merely as "Dear

Thanksgiving. "But I suppose you
don'it care," he wrote.
In this and subsequent letters he had
stopped pleading with 'Marian for

Late in November he wrote tB&t he

stuff to take."
He wrote to Josephine Davis Jan. 21,
"I don't know what to think of Marian
being so sick, write and tell me all
about it." The next day he sent a
letter to Marian, care of Josephine.
"Jo has told me you have been pretty
sick," he wrote to Marian.
Defense Is Prepared.
The first installment of some Im

down the commonwealth's} case and
raise more than a reasonable doubt
that Will Orpet Is responsible for the
murder of Marian Lambert will be In

Ralph F. Potter have said they pos

which caused her death.

The nature of this evidence has
been carefully concealed, but they
promise many surprises for State's At
torney Dady, of Lake "county, and
State's Attorney Joslyn, of MoHenry
county, who have exerted themselves
to obtain a conviction. It would not
be the first surprise the prosecutors
have experienced during the trial, un

The defense immediately will fl!«
several motions to have certain testi
mony stricken from the record. These
will Include:
Testimony relating to cyanide of
potassium buried in the ash heap in a
greenhouse under the control of Orpet'*
father, because, it Is declared, there is
nothing connecting the defendant with
it or connecting It with the cyanide
found by analysis in the girl's stom
ach.
Testimony that three spots on Mar
ian's coat were made by liquid cyanide,
because, it is charged, there was no
proper custody of the coat.
A hypothetical question resulting in
the expression of an opinion that Mar
ian's death resulted from liquid cyan
ide, because, it Is argued, all the ele
ments proved In evidence were not In
cluded in the question.
Statements of the authorities by
Orpot, because it is declared they were
made under duress and he was not
warned beforehand.
Testimony of SCverett Frlg&nza, a re
porter, on the ground that he conspired
with the state's attorney to have him

At first I just giggled because I thought

I wasn't happy, so. I tried to disguise

Questioned by Republican Leader
Mann and others. Mr. Hay told the
house that the action did not contem-(
plate a state of war but that the mere
fact of the Introduction of the resolu-,
tion handed to him by the war depart
ment "shows that in the opinion of the
executive the emergency does exist and
that this resolution is necessary to meet
tho emergency."
Unanimous consent for consideration
of the resolution, was given and general
debate began under an agreement for a
two-hour limit.
Representative Mann made a speech
declaring that a state of war with Mex
ico already existed to all intents and
purposes and expressing the opinion
that the troops were now carrying out
tho purpose for which they were sent
into Mexico. He said that he did not
see how the.v could be withdrawn under
the present situation, and if they were
to stay the military strength of the
country must be Increased.
Representative Biitler, of Pennsyl
vania, republican, urged that the pres
ident should advise congress as to his
reasons for determining that an emer
gency was at hand.
"I think we are declaring war here
now." said Representative Madden, of
Illinois.
Mr. Hay reported that the president
would be required to come back to con
gress if a declaration of war waa
deemed necessary.
This resolution does not contemplate
a declaration of war or that a state of
war exists, he added.
