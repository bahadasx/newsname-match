BIG CELEBRATION
AMER LAKE
Will Last Two Days - July
3 and 4
There is to be a big celebration
Atwater lake the 3rd and 4th of
* July. The lake is a beautiful place
for a celebration having many
natural advantages to make it a
delightful spot to spend a few days
of rest and enjoyment.
There will be no admission
charged at the grounds. Every
body is welcome to camp on the
grounds absolutely free and every
thing will be done to make the time
spent a very enjoyable one.
Ball games, dancing, fishing,
boating and many other attractions
are being planned to furnish amuse
ment for the crowd. A bowery
to be erected and dancing may be
indulged in during the afternoon
and evening of both days.
Those who do not take their
lunches will be able to get meals
at reasonable rates as there are to
be a number of lunch stands on the
grounds. It has been proposed by
the management to provide tents
for campers which can be rented
for the use of those who wish to
stay all night but do not care to
bother with a camping outfit. If
this plan is carried out it will no
doubt bring a number who would
not otherwise be present as the ex
pense of going and coming to and
from the lake every day would be
more than renting a tent.
The celebration will no doubt
bring a number of people from a
distance as the idea of camping out
on the lake shore will be a big
drawing card.
Rebekahs Visit Kendiick
Monday, June 19, 1916, Mrs. H.
P. Hull entertained the Juliaetta
and Kendrick Rebekah lodges. The
object of the occasion was to meet
Mrs. Augusta K. Johnson, Pres
ident of the Rebekah State Assem
bly, and Mrs. Retta Holman, of
Moscow, Past President of the
Assembly. Three Past Noble
Grands and others from Juliaetta,
were present. From Kendrick
there were four Past Noble Grands
the Noble Grand and Vice Grand
and other members.
The visitors were met at the de
pot by a delegation from the Kend
rick lodge and conducted to the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Hull.
Mrs. Johnson came here with the
intention of making the local lodge
an official visit but the hall could
not be secured as it was not a reg
ular meeting night, so the affair
was turned into an eveninq of
social enjoyment.
About five o'clock light refresh
ments were served consisting of
C a, ice cream and cake.
Many thanks are due Mr. and
Mrs. Hull for so kindly entertain
ing the lodge members in their
home. A Rebekah.

preparations to celebrate the Fourth

A good program has been arranged
and the people of Southwick are
sparing no pains to make the day

spend the day in one of the pretti
est sections of the Potlatch country

Petrick-Ashton
The home of Mr. and Mrs. J.
Petrick was the scene of a quiet but
very pretty wedding last Sunday
afternoon at four-thirty o'clock,
when their daughter, Miss Agnes,
was united in marriage to Mr.
James P. Ashton, of Juliaetta. None
but relatives of the bride and groom
were present. Rev. George Finke
performed tl.e ceremony.
The bride is an accomplished
young lady and very popular with
the young people of this community
among whom she has a host of
friends. The groom is a well known
young business man of Juliaetta.
The friends of both bride and
groom wish them many years of
happiness and prosperity. Their
home will be in Juliaetta.
'
In a decision handed down by ;
Judge Edgar C. Steele in the dis
trict court, the court holds that
power to abolish road districts was
a matter purely in the descretion
of the board of county commission
Powers of County Boards
reverse the action of the board un
ers and that the court shouldn't
less there was an abuse of that
discretion.
No abuse was found in the case
of the Potlatch Lumber company
versus the board of county com
missioners, evidence of which was
introduced during the present term
which the plaintiff sought to have
the court recind the action of the
board in abolishing road district
No. 2 and including it within the
boundaries of a district in which
the town of Potlatch is located.
The board abolished the district so
that there would be more taxable
property so that the people would
have more special tances for the un
keep of the roads. The Potlatch
Lumber company appealed from
the action of the board.—Star-Mir
Young Man, Who Are You?
Are you known by your own name,
or are you known merely as your
father's son? Are you known by
your own good qualities and by your
own acts, or are you remembered
simply because you bear the name
of better people who conceived you
and brought you into this world?
The young man who can look his el
ders straight in *the eye and say,"I
am James Martin,''already has op
portunity at his feet, but the fellow
who can say nothing better than
that he is "Robert Martin's son,"
wUl still be groping in the'darkness,
of the future after opportunity has
vanished in the distance. Be some
thing,do something, create a per
sonality of your own, and the world
will know you and respect you for
what you are and not for what your
parents were before you. But con
tinue content as "another man's
son" and you will be accorded the
respect and privileges only of ano
ther man's son, and when death over
takes you your home paper will speak
charitably of you merely as "anoth
er man's son."-Great Bend Tri .

SH TICKETS
Fair Association Now
ing Funds
Rais
The Kendrick Fair Association
has had season tickets printed and
they are to be sold at fifty cents
each. Anyone interested in promot
ing the fair should invest in a tic
ket right now as it gives the
management a better opportunity to
size up the support that may be
expected this fall.
This fair is not a local affair
entirely, it is to be given by Ken
drick and the surrounding country
and every farmer who has any
money invested in the Potlatch
ought to feel a proprietary interest
in the success of it. Last year the
' fair was a suçcess in every way and
; there . g nQ reason why this year it
may nQt be even better .
^ number of the business men
have taken 25 t i c kets-bought them
outright and are going to dispose
j tbgm
It is up to everybody now
to possess one. Ask any business
man - n town and he will see that
you are provided with as many
tickets as yoii want at fifty cents
each.
In order to get twenty-five in the
hands of lucky purchasers at the
earliest possible time,, the Gazette
will give a ticket to any back sub
scriber who is a year or more in
arrears, providing he comes in and
pays his subscription to date. This
offer is good until after the-4th of
July.
The money derived from the sale
of the tickets is to be used for fenc
ing the fair gr0U nds and for putt
ing up buildings for the livestock
and exhibits. With an equipment
of this kind the fair can be put on
a permanent basis. It is the object
of the Association to sell a thousand
tickets. It can be done if every
body will help.

On Tuesday evening, Mr. and
Mrs. G. G. Oldfield entertained a
large number of their Kendrick
friends at their new residence on
the hill. The occasion was the
celebration of their tenth wedding
anniversary and the evening was
appropriately started off by the
host, who kindled the hearth-fire
with a taper in commemoration of
the fire he had laid ten year before
in his first matrimonial establish
ment. The lights were turned out
and, as the flames took hold of the
kindling, Mrs. Joday Long sang
"Home Sweet Home," the entire
assembly joining in with the refrain.
During the evening many new
and interesting games were in
troduced by the hostess and their
popularity was evidenced by
tbe 1
amount of merriment caused by
each new entertainment. Miss
Luella Hoyt played several piano
solos and their pleasing rendition
was one of the evenings best num
bers. Mrs. Flo entertained the
guests with vocal selections from
her seemingly unlimited repertoire
and charmed them with the quality
and strength of her voice. Refresh
ments were served by "mine host
ess" at the usual hour and the
party dispersed after wishing Mr.
and Mrs. Oldfield many more happy
anniversaries. All present express
ed the desire to be a guest at the
diamond wedding of their host aud
hostess.

There Was an Old Geezer
There was an old geezer and he
had a lot of sense. He started up a
business on a dollar eighty cents. The
dollar for stock and the 80 for an
ad, brought him three lovely dollars
in a day, by dad! Well, he bought
more goods and a little more space,
and he played that system with a
smile on his face. The customers
flocked to his two-by-four, and soon
he had to hustle for a regular store.
Up on the square, where the people
pass,he gobbled up a corner that was
all plate glass. He fixed up the win
dows with the best that he had, and
1 told them all about it in a half page
ad _ He soon had'em coming and he
neV er, never quit, and he wouldn't
cut down on his ads, one jit. And he's
kept things humming in the town
ever since, and everybody calls him
the-Merchant Prince. Some say it's
luck, but that's all bunk—why he
was doing business when the times
were punk ! People have to purchase
and Geezer was wise—for he knew
the way to get 'em was to advertise.

BUSINESS MEN
DEFEATJULIAETTA
Score Stood 16 to 4 at The
End of The Game
a
to
of
The Kendrick business men's team
proved to be too much for the Julia
etta business men in the game
played here last Friday. Kendrick
won an easy victory by a score of
16 to 4. The game was a surprise
to everybody on account of the few
errors made. The week of practice
indulged in by the Kendrick team
brought good results in the im
proved manner of play.
Manager Wilcox pulled off some
grand plays on second base which
were the feature of the game. He
was also one of the heavy hitters.
Watts played a good game on first
base but that was expected as he is
a real ball player. The out field
played the entire game without an
error.
Juliaetta had a good bunch of
ball players but they showed a lack
of practice and were most too fat
to play ball on a day when the
thermometer registered one hun
dred in the shade. Rodgers, the
right fielder was the biggest man
on either team and if size had any
thing to do with it, he ought to
have won the game all by himself.
Fox, Semmes and Odern pitched
for Juliaetta and Ed Petrick caught.
Knepper pitched and Thomas caught
for Kendrick. Kendrick played
Thomas, Watts, Wilcox, Flo, Patton,
Dunkle, Porter, Compton, Woody
and Knepper, Juliaetta had the
following men in the game: Petrick,
Fox, Rodgers, Odern, Lintch, Kite,
Jordan, Pepple, Semmes, Gullidge.
