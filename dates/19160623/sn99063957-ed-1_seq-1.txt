f;rmod reports received today by Am

troops 0 and K of the Tenth United
states cavalry were practically an
nihilated in the fighting at Carrizal
when lel into the Oarrauzista trap.
The little handful of American sol

outnumbered, were forced back. The

Inked Slates cavalrymen whose mounts
liad stampeded, the troopers dismount
ed to fight, declared the private ad
vices. The few who escaped are reported to

food or water. It was said that General
l'ershing had sent n strong column to
rescue the scattered fragments ot the
force nearly slaughtered at lamzal.
The relief column was reported racing
along the dry bed of the Rio Carmen
toward Carrizal.
These advices are contradicted by of
ficial Mexican reports.
In compliance with Washington's or
ders, a virtual embargo on foodstuffs
was in effect along the border here to
day. Military- measures were taken to
prevent large quantities of food cross
ing into Mexico and falling into the
bands of tho Carrnir.istas.
The Juarez civilian guard, assisted
liy 150 Oarranzistn troops called back
to protect the Mexican city .are be
lieved to have prevented the slicking of
Juarez by about a hundred low class
Mexicans from El Paso. After the bulk
of the Carranzistns forces evacuated the
city, theso Mexicans crossed to Juarez,
bent on looting, it is believed. Some
were arrested. A heavy patrol guarded
Juarez all night under orders to shoot
any one attempting to loot the partly
deserted city.
A party of 75 former Villistas cross
ed into Mexico below Juarez to join
the Carranzistns, believing intervention
is coining. The attitude of a majority
of Mexican refugees in the I'nited
States was believed to have been ex
pressed by General Felip Angeles when
he was interviewed today.
"If the I'nited States government
intervenes for the purpose of fighting
The Cnrranzistn government," said An
geles, "the thousands of refugees will
not be lured to support the first chief
1y appeals of patriotism.
'"But if the United States fights the
Mexican people as a nation, this will be
considered conquest and the refugees
will return to their native land to fight
the invaders."
Angeles stnted that ninny refugees
would be glad to see Carranza 's govern
ment crumble. They want him deposed
by the I'nited States for driving thou
si.nds of Mexicans into exile.

As Result of Spy Scare Every

Columbus, N. M., June 2.1. Spies for
tho do facto government have been
watching the shipment of troops and
supplies at the Columbus base. One sus
pect is under arrest today and several
others are being watched. A German
who lived in Mexico City many years
and came here since the Villista raid,
is under surveillance. The others are
ostensibly peaceable Mexican residents
of the town.
A quantity of noto books and papors,
covered with notations, were found on
the porson of Aydres Sandoval, the
Mexican taken into custody yesterday.
Many Mexican families fled from
Columbus into Mexico simultaneously
w ith the disappearance of 40 Carran
zista soldiers composing the customs
guard At the border three miles south.
As a result of the spy score, more
vigorous precautions- than ever were
put into effect in the base camp here.
The arsenal containing millions of
rounds of ammunition was the object
of the principal protective measures.
(Deleted by censor.) Outposts have
been strengthened and stationed farth

military reservation are very strict.
Civilian drivers were warned to obey
the regulations.
During the night all Mexican militia
in the federal service here were taken

Forwards Story As It Was
Told Him by Troopers
Who Escaped
Washington, June 23. The war de
partment this afternoon gave out the
first report transmitted by General
Pershing on the fight nt Carrizal. It
was the account given by troopers wh
had reached field headquarters, after
the fight, ahead of the main force and
the one described by department of
ficials as insufficient to determine the
United Mates' course of action. The
tet follows:
"Pershing questioning troops with
reference to the Ahumaiiu affair. Two
troops, Tenth cavalry, Boyd's troops C
and Morey 's troop K joined on night
of Twentieth at Ojo San Domingo,
marched within one mile of Carrizal on
the twenty-first, Captain Boyd in com
mand, arriving there at 7:110 a. m., Boyd
sent n Mexican guide, askod permission
to pass through the town. Mexican
guide returned with refusal from Gen
eral Gomez. Then Gomez sent out note
by orderly stating Boyd might pass
through the town, providing he stopped
for a conference. Then General Gomez
himself came out and discussed the sit
uation 15 or 20 minutes with Boyd.
Meantime Mexican troops moving out
from the town, began surrounding
Boyd's column. Gomez retired and
when ho reached the right of his troops,
Mexican troops began firing machine
guns. Boyd then dismounted to fight
ou foot."
Secretary Baker in connection with
the report said that Pershing added he
had sent out cavalry to support and
bring back the two troops in qnuestion.
As yet, Baker said, Pershing has had
no opportunity to confer with officers
of either of the troops. What, if any
misunderstanding led to the attack, it is
impossible to decide, upon the evidence
at hand, he said.

SALVADOR IS NEUTRAL
Washington, June 23. Minis
ter Znldivar of Salvador, denied
today reports from Mexieo City
that his country would join
Mexico in resisting interven
tion or invasion by the Uited
States.
"My country is interested
only iu a broad way in keeping
peace botween the two repub
lics," Baid Zaldivar. "But we
aro not iu sympathy with one
party as against another. We
hope both countries may find an
honorable way out of the situa
tion." Mexico City, June 23. Salvador and
Costa Rica have notified the Mexican
government- that they will join- Mexico
in opposing ' invasion by the Vnited
States, it was Btatcd today.
Though armed conflict with tho Uni
ted States is now considered imminent,
tho Mexican, people Htill hop foi a
settlement of the controversy by diplo
matic conference.
Thursday was a holiday in the cap
ital, being the religious festival of Cot
pus Christi. Business was suspended
generally. The streets and parks were
crowded. The peoplo talked nothing but
the prospects of war with I'nited
States.
Mexican business men interviewed by
the United Press did not believe that
the I'nited States would risk destroy
ing her friendly relations with Latin
American countries after laboring so
hard to establish them, by conflict with
Mexico. They believe tho American
government realizes that tho invasion
o'f .Mexico would arouse hostilities
against the United States through Cen
tral and South America, endangering, if
not ruining the trudo connections of
American trade merchants and manu
facturers. In fact all classes of people
seem to believe that some way will bo
found out of the difficulty without a.
break of friendly relations.
The proclamation by War Minister
Obrcgon calling upon all who have been
in arms against the government to
abandon that attitude nnd join the Car
riinza forces in enso of war with the
United States, is to bo expected to bring
general response. Those who have been
declared outlaws by i.arranza are ex
cluded from the cull. Those who do
not respond to the call will be consider
