RANGE RIGHTS OF
SHEEP AND CATTLE
Acquittal of William and Peter
Vreeland, Flockmasters, In Lat
est Contest Brought in Probate
Court.
A verdict of acquittal in the sheep
case brought against William and
Peter Vreeland and prosecuted by the
Stoekgrowers' association through
Alex Cruikshank was reached at a
late hour last night. The jury retired
at 6 o'clock anti returned their find
ing it 11. It wav stated that on the
first billot there were seven for ac
quittal and five for conviction. For
sometime there were ten for acquit
tal .with the dual aggreinent a« stat
ed.
The case is briefly reported else
where in this paper. The locality
where the alleged unlawful ranging
of sheep took place is near ttie divide
above Leadore. Witnesses testified
that except for the presence of stray
cattle tiiereon it had ;not been used
as a cattle range for seven or eight
years. The Vreelands have had
siieep there off and on for several
years, it was stated. Cattle men had
avoided it because of the presence
upon it of poisonous cattle feed. The
sheep men generally took up this
case as a test to detremine theii
range rights, whether or not the fact
that cattle had been ranged on
a given locality in years past but af
terwaid taken from it for years to
gether would forever bar the siieep
ftoin its use.

The first news of the warlike con

WHEN GOLD DUST
j(WAS USED IN PAY
Precious Metal Dropped Through
Old Floor Is Recovered By L.
F. Ramey.
The old brick stables in Salmon,
which are being transformed into a
modern garage, for several years were
not considered nor until now a gold
mine., although the owners, Luu'of
Harney and Tom Kane, always re
celved a lair return from the proper
tv in the way of rentals. Tue owners
have lime and again turned down
good offers for Ihe purchase of the
stables. When it came time to tear)
away the old office floor yesterday
Harney was on the scene with shov
el anil gold pan to ascertain what
amount Pi the precious metal cu lb
he rniii-d under (lie hoards. Gold
dust was used as a medium of ex
change in the days of Leesburg, when
the old stables were headquarters
for miners and prospectors. Amid a
toil or two of oat hulls Hainey soon
struck pay dirt after he began pan
ning and his reward was not wanting
the recovery of a nugget worth a
dollar or so. Iiesides hue gold that
had dropped through the crack», rep

old time who was rich and didn't
