NUMBER 25
Richardson Tells
Of The Capture
Gives The Facts Regarding The
Arrest of McCracken
Last Week.
Wm. McCracken, who has been
sought for four years by officers
of North and South Dakota,
Wvomintr and Montana on the
charge of horse stealing, is at
last safe behind the bars of the
Custer county jail.
McCracken was arrested about
8:30 Wednesday morning at his
ranch on Thompson creek, in the
south end of Custer county, by
Stock Detective W. A. Richard
son, assisted by Stock Detective
Wm. E. McCarty. He was taken
completely by surprise and had
no opportunity to pull a gun or
make a break, as not over 25 feet
from him stood Detective Rich
ardson with his eye sighted along
a wicked looking rifle and with a
smile on his face inviting him to
"Throw 'em up" which invita
tion Mr. McCracken promptly ac
cepted. McCarty was close at
hand and the two quickly made
their prisoner secure from escape
and took him to the house.
Mrs. McCracken at first was
inclined to be wrathful and sar
castic. "You must be hunting
for bear," she said. "Do you
carry these all the time?" (mean
the artillery).
"You said it." laconically re
plied Mr. Richardson.
Mrs. McCracken finally cooled
off and accepted the situation
with what calmness and good will
she could and prepared a good
breakfast, after which the of
ficers brought their charge to
Miles City.
The specific charge on which
McCracken is wanted is the steal
ing of three head of horses from
the Archor outfit, in Fallon
county three years oi more ago,
but the place was at that time in
Custer County. He is believed
by Detective Richardson and De
puty Frank Evans of Fallon
county, who is also in the city,
to have stolen himself or in col
lusion with others at least 300
head of horses from ranches in
four states.
Detectives Richardson and Mc
Carty and Deputy Evans have
been on his trail for several
weeks past, following him thru
Wyoming and drawing closer to
to him. For 13 days they slept
and for 13 nights they rode and
for the last 36 hours preceding
the capture they were out of pro
visions and Richardson had the
good luck to shoot a jackrabbit.

S. A. HOLT, Proprietor
Evans, from whose custody
McCracken once escaped by a
ruse, after being on his honor,
was unfortunate not to be in on
the final capture, having been
called home by the illness of his
wife, but he was with the man
hunters through all their travels
and helped to unravel the trail.
Richardson and McCarty were
camped Wsdnesday morning a
couple of miles away from the
McCracken ranch. They had
been holding a vigil of nearly
two days without seeing any
signs of McCracken and were
almost come to the bilief that he
was not at home. Wednesday
morning Richardson pulled out
his field glasses and discerned a
horse, a brown which he thought
he recognized as one that was
stolen from a rancher in Moor
croft, Wyoming. The detective
concluded that where the horse
was McCracken also and they
started to work up carefully to
wards the house, keeping out
of sight as much as possible.
Finally McCracken came out;
of the house and took cautious |
observations. Then he wenti
back. Then he came out again
and milked the cow. The officers
were not close enough yet to
make an attempt at arresting
him ane they gradually worked
up closer. McCracken next sent
his boy, who has been a great
help to him in previous pinches,
out to look around. The boy
went in locality where McCarty
was but did not detect him.
At length McCracken came out
to feed the hogs. While he was
engaged in this occupation Rich
ardson manage to get within
about 25 feet of him. He threw
down on him with his gun and
then called "Throw 'e m up,
Mack." McCracken turned round
astonished and at a glance saw
that there was no use of attempt
ing flight or resistance and yield
ed without debate, especially as
McCarty appeared on the scene
from another quarter and the
hopelessness of resistance was
evident.—Miles City Star.

says that the cattle markets are
looking very promising and that
prices in and around Gillette and
other Wyoming points are much

the mistake the people of this

their cattle at such a low figure
as has been lately noticed. Native
beef steers are now selling on
the Chicago markets at from
$8.50 to $11.50, and the indica
tions are that these prices will
soon go up much higher.

Henry Malmquist, son of John
F. Malmquist who resides on
Beaver Flat was brought to town
yesterday by Dr. Baker and
Sherill and was taken to the hos
pital at.C imp Crook. The young
fellow has been having a very
hard seige of inflamatory rhema
tism and at times was very low.
It is hoDed that with the excellent
care received at the hospital he
will speedily recover.
Whether by accident ot pre
arrangement, several rain clouds
bumped into each other Monday
afternoon and the way it rained
for about a half an hour convinc
ed us that not all the water lies
in the ocean. Nearly an inch of
rainfall was recorded at the local
weather station. The storm also
showered some hail, not very
large ones but a good supply of
the size it had in store. Nor did
uhe rain let up. Ever since, it
has been cold, disagreeable and
fogy with a good shower every
now and then. It was the heavi
est fall of moisture of the season
and filled all water holes through
out the country, a welcome sight
to the stockmen.
' The Battle Cry of Peace" was
shown at the Play House both
Monday afternoon and evening
and proved itself the great play
that was promised. The attend
ance was not large, this condi
tion being brought about by the
heavy rain storm that arrived in
the late afternoon, making the
roads almost impassible. A large
delegation from Camp Crook and
other nearby places started fur
Ekalaka to attend the show but
were caught in the storm and
forced to return to their homes.
It was a little hard luck for the
Play House, but the management
promises that the best their is
in motion pictures will continue
to be shown at this popular
amusement hall.

Peter Giannonatti of Ludlôw.
The transfer included 325 acres
of deeded land at the mouth of
Corral creek, the consideration
being $7,000. Mr. Giannonatti
and sons will make the place
headquarters for their extensive
live stock interests. Part of the
land is irrigated and is one of the
best hay ranches in that locality.
The Sherriils have no preseftt
intention of leaving the country,
as they retain their cattle and
horses. They will occupy leased
land for the summer and later
seek a permanent location. —Gaz
