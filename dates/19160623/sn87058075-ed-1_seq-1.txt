CRESCO, HOWARD COUNTY, IOWA, FRIDAY, JUNE 23, 1916
FREE
This school was established through
the efforts of the late Father McCartey
thirty-three years ago. The first grad
uate was Miss Lauraine Mead in 1899.
Since that time 73 pupils have gradu
ated, 35 being present at the banquet.
The feast was followed by program,
after which dancing was indulged in by
those who wished.

Chautauqua in Session.
The Chautauqua session opened Mon
day and while the audiences have been
fairly large, cold and unfavorable
weather has so far caused a large num
ber of vacant seats at every session,
and it is thought that there wilL be a
deficit on the guarantee of less than
$100 for the Commercial Club to make
good.
Tbe musical attractions are all pleas
ing, the Kellogg—Haines Singing Party
and the Welsh glee singers being per
haps the favorites of the past four days.
The lectures are all entertaining and
fully up to the standard set by previous
Chautauquas.
Today, Friday, when the Kryl Band
plays two concerts, will doubtless be
the big day of the Chautaqua if weath
er and road conditions are favorable.
Minstrel Show a Success.
A crowded house greeted the Cresco
Minstrels last Friday evening and every
one was delighted with the program.
The performance owed much of its suc
cess to the director, Homer Deane,
who gave to it a touch of professional
ism that added ginger and dash to the
choruses and the vaudeville acts which
made up the second part. The work of
Mr. Deane with his new novelty musi
cal instrument was one of the hits of
the evening. The songs were all new
and "catchy" and the endmen's "gags"
were of the 1916 crop.
Time Given Minor.
Notice is hereby given that I have
this day given my minor son, Louis,
his time, and I will hereafter collect
none of his wages nor be responsible
for any bill he may incur.

"The Burlington Way" Finally Estab
lished by Board of Directors.
After several meetings covering a
period of two months it has been final
ly decided that the connecting link be
tween McGregor and Cresco which com
pletes that section between St. Louis
and St. Paul of the Burlington Way
shall follow the old military road thru
North McGregor, Monona, Postville,
Castalia, Ossian, Calmar and Ridgeway.
Steps wil' be taken in the near future
to organize the above mentioned towns
for the purpose of making it the most
popular trail in the world as its promo
ters iiesire.
It is now conceded that the plan of
organization will make it the best
marked trail in the country. When
completed one can start from Winnipeg
for New Orleans following the ridge
back of the Mississippi River most of
the distance and find a band of Orange
and White on every pole along the route.
In addition to this, danger signs will be
properly placed and mile boards on each
side of every town along the route will
inform the tourist of his whereabouts.
Adventist Tent Meeting Announcement
The services of pastor and Mrs. F.
W. Myer of Stuart, la., have been se
cured for work in this locality. They
come to us highly recommended. Mrs.
Myer haa for a number of years been
engaged in missionary work and for
two years has filled the position of
State Conference Home Missionary De
partment Secretary and in this labor
has traveled widely.
Evangelist Wolfe has calls for re
vival work so numerous that he usually
has his plans and appointments made
two years ahead and can give but little
time to local work. Since last Septem
ber he has labored from Minneapolis to
Atlanta, Ga.
For near three quarters of a century
our denomination has conducted gospel
tent meetings and have grown into an
organization that today is operating in
all nations with an outlay of One thous
and dollars a day on its foreign work
alone.
Tent camping when properly arrang
ed is pleasant and healthful. Evangel
ist and Mrs. Wolfe have for twelve
seasons followed this line of work be
sides their travels and labor in China.
As the season is here for this work and
the weather for this was such last year
that many were deprived of attending
some of the best lectures we thought it
wise to arrange for anot'ier short ser
ies of meetings. For this the location
by the new Catholic Church has been
secured and the Camp is being arrang
ed for opening 7:45 p. m. June 25th.
After considerable reflection and per
suasion Evangelist Wolfe assisted by
Pastor and Mrs. Myer and Pastor Vic
tor Dietel, of Nevada, la., has consent
ed to conduct another short series of
lectures in this place.
The Evangelist is a much more 'ih
eral mar- than those who are not per
sonally Kcquainted with him are aware
of. For example he said in part 'that
though some were prejudiced against
his meetings yet he held no prejudice
against anyone and wished every good
work for the upbuilding of God's king
dom success."
And further it th^ y^iiie la
boring aa'&stor of a church in one of
the large cities of the west ho served
as Secretary of the County Association
of ministers and was a close friend to
the Pastors of the Baptist, Congrega
tional and M. E. Churches, often ex
changing pulpits with ^them. While at
West Union, two years ago, he became
a close friend of Father Fitzgerald of
the Catholic Church, toward which peo
ple, said he, "though a Protestant, I
hold very friendly feelings because my
grandfather on my father's side was
one of the highest educated German
Catholics of Germany. My mother's
people were German Lutheran."
We believe th »t with such [liberality
and the deep earnestness of|the Evan
gelist he will receive a good hearing
I and we cordially invite you when not
worshiping elsewhere to come to these
1
meetings. See program elsewhere.

Rufus Seavy Takes Own Life.
The community was shocked beyond
measure this morning at the unbeliev
able report of the icide of Rufus
Seavy.
He was found by his daughter Wini
fred about seven o'clock hanging by
the neck from a rope in the barn which
is being used as a garage.
No cause can be given for this act of
suicide, except that of ill health caus
ing temporary mental derangement.
He had been in rather poor health for
the past year. In conversation with
friends yesterday he appeared as usual
and in fact very cheerful.
His youngest daughter Winifred kept
house for him and it was customary for
him to arise at about seen o'clock
each morning and awaken her. He did
not call her this morning as usual and
when she awoke some time after seven
she did not see her father and went to
the garage looking for him and ran into
the awful spectacle of seeing her fath
er hanging from a beam dead. She
immediately gave the alarm and her
brother-in-law, Jack Benson hurried
over and took down the body. It is
sad occurrence, shocking in the ex
trenie to the family and friends as
well. Riceville Recorder.

Telephone Operators Win Praise.
Miss Ann Barnes, of Des Moines,
Iowa, employed by the Iowa State Tel*
phone Association, was in Cresco re
cently inspecting the local telephone
exchange and instructing the operators,
but found her word along this lino
mainly confined to conducting a school
of instruction in long distance calls
methods of efficiency which are needful
to be taught elsewhere, had already
was instituted in the local exchange by
its superintendent, Mr. Addie.
Under Mr. Addie's supervision,
seven operators employed in the
the
Cresco
exchange have achieved a
service
record of 21 seconds per call, and
Misa
Brown informs us that 4 seconds
considered a good average in the
is
large
city exchanges with a magneto
drop
It
may not be known to all that
th«
salaries of the Cresco operators
are
governed to a great extent by the effi
ciency record attained in the active
work of the office, a system worked out
by Mr. Addie, and one so unique and
satisfactory that Miss Barnes will rec
ommend it to other exchanges wherq
increased efficiency is demanded.
Miss Barnes found little to criticize
or improve in the work of the local
operators, but wished us to impress
upon the public the uselessnes3 of re
sponding "Hello" to a telephone call
but that parties receiving a call should
announce their name when taking
down the receiver, thereby saving time
and increasing service speed, and also
resulting in much less confusion and
error in transaction of busir.e ,3.
