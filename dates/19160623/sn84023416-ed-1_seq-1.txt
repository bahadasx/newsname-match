How-Cabana.
The following was taken from the
Buffalo Counier:
"The marriage of Miss Emily Allen
Cabana and Walter Alan How took
place last evening at 6:30 o'clock in
the First Unitarian church, the Rev.
Richard W. Boynton officiating. The
bride wore a costume of pearl gray
taffeta and a corsage bouquet of Bon
Silene roses. Following the cere
mony there was a reception and din-
ner at the home of the bride's par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. Elmer A. Cab
ana, No. 4G8 Potomac avenue. Cov
ers were laid for ten at the bride's
table which was centered with a
basket of roses and lilies of the vai
'ey. The other guests were seated
at small tables decorated with roses
in bud vases. After July 1 Mr. and
Mrs. How will be at home at No.
4G8 Potomac avenue."
"Clean-Up" Compositions, by
Pupils of the Convent.
the "Cleaning up."
Since about two weeks everyone is
cleaning up their yards, front and
back. The town is making parks at
nearly every street corner, later in
the season to be filled with flowers
and plants. What admirable sug
gestion! We already have a town
site as beautiful by nature as any in
the state. We shall not be ashamed
of our little town and we will try to
make it a joy for all our summer
visitors.
The "Clean Up" Committee has
been asking the people not to throw
papers and other things on the
streets. We are only, too happy
to comply with such a reasonable de.
mand, and are ready to help all we
can in sweeping old Dirt away even
if it requires for that the assistance
of the Brighton Broom Brigade.
Captain Augustine Rooney,
6th Grade
We are making a composition on
"Cleaning-Up,"what the town is do
ing just now. Island Pond is im
proving and the health officer, Dr
bargont, is interested in the lm-
provment of health as well as to the
good appearance of our little town.
some time ago tne town nan an tne
stones, tin cans, old papers and ev
erything unsightly removed as these
hinder the good appearance of the
place aiready so pretty with its
beautiful nature. I hope all the
children buying oranges and bananas
will not throw the peels on the
streets or on the sidewalks, and it is
to be hoped this good work will last
inenwe snail not deplore tne re
peated cases of infectious disease we
often meet. If we pay more atten
tion to our streets and properties
health will suffer less from it. Dis
ease germs will multiply in dirty
places, you know.
Accidents may also occur through
neglect on the part of careless chil
dren eating iruit on the streets and
through refuse which is rather slip
pery. Raymond Tracy, 6th grade
The subject of our composition this
week is about the cleaning up of the
streets that the people of Island
Pond have undertaken to do lately
1 am sure the pupils of the convent
will be very glad to do all in their
power to help, in some measure, in
this interesting work.
We have been notified not to throw
on the streets papers, sticks or any
thing unsightly or that" which may
appear disorderly, io suggest us
to do things we would not like to
do, would really be disagreeable, but
to oblige us to keep our yards clean
antl not to throw cans or such things
