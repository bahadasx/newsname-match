Washington, June 2i). With
President Wilson's firm refusal
to withdra w American It oops
from Mexico on its way to th
de faoto government, embodied
in a note sternly arraigning the
whole course of General Carran
za in the situation which has
brought the two countries to the
verge of war, tne administration
continued to make its prepura
tious to meet any emergency
thai may untie.
War or peace rests with Gen
eral Carranza. The position of
the United States is pointedly
set forth in its review of the ap
parent inaoility ot Carranza to
prevent border raids and to keep
the obligation he owes tlie world
by the preservation of order in
his dominions.
At the cabinet meeting the
opinion prevailed that the
chances were overwhelmingly in
the direction of war. The one
hope was that General Cartai.za
v would be impressed by the mni
4 tary preparations of the United
States and make no further
elfort to have American troops
withdrawn. There has been no
indication, however, that Car
ranza's intentions are peaceful,
and every move now is being
planned in the belief that hostil
ities may begin at any moment.
The note serves notice that as
long as the Carranza forces con
tinue their present attitude, no

has adopted the policy of re

it is desired you advise this
Bureau the area in Ciovis that
is proviced with the public
improvements rtquisite for city
delivery; state whether the sec
tions so provideded are con
tiguous; and approximate the
population of the territory in
which these improvements are
installed.
It is also desired that you for
ward a copy of the train sched
ules and indicate the hours of
14 miles north of Ciovis, Mon
.; y, where wheat harvesting
operations are in progress. We
visited the fields, of C. v Kelly,
Sam Pipkin, 11. J. Suhl, Junes
estate and Fred W, James. The
must of Mr. Pipkin's wheat will
make twenty bushels to the acre,
he estimates, and the balance of
tne fields visited will yield from
twelve to fitteen or eighteen
bushels to the acre. Mr Kelly
also has a young orchard which
is in a flourishing condition, not
withstanding the drouth. His
three ear old cherry trees are
loaded wi;h fruit which 1 or fla
vor will rival that raised in the
best fruit districts of the coun
try. He has also made a success
of raising alfalfa which he has
found to be suitable lor hog
pasture.
Base Ball Battings
"We have met the enemy and
we are theirs." This was not
exactly Perry's message after
the naval battle on lake Erie,
but it was the message of the
Clovis fan 011 :s after their en-
gaKement with the Koswell all
star ball team Sunday afternoon
at the North Park ball grounds.
The score stjod nine to one in
favor of the visitors and it was
nut until the last inning that
Clovis broke thj "goose egg"
line up. While Clovis has one
of the best teams it has had for
many years, there is no disput
ing the fact that they were en
tirely out classed. In fact you
can take it irom us that the
Uoswell aggregation has any
thing in New Mexico out classed.
Tne vallty bunch have never be
fore assembled such a team,
which has won every game
played this year, Their winning
s'.reak is not due to good luck
but to first class ball playing.
While the game was a one sided
alla.r, it was the best played
here this season. Tne atten
dance was 8 mail.
P. H. Ambrose Transferred
P. H Aii.brose, for the past
three years an. employe in the
( Hice of the storekeeper of the
Santa Fe here, has been trans
ferred to Topeka, Kansas, and
Mrs. Ambrose and himself de
parted for that pjint this wek.
Mr. Ambrose resided in Topeka
before coming here, consequent
ly will be glad to get back home
again. They have a host of
friends among the young people
of this city who will read of
their removal from our midst
with a feeling of sincere regret.
