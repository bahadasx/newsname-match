HEALTH HINTS.
A. J. Booker, M. D.
A few important funerals would
help this community more than any
one thing in the world. I do not like
funerals, personally, but they are
good things sometimes. Every living
thing has its
use and every
living thing out
grows its use
fulness. When
a thing is use
less it is only a
short time until
it becomes a
nuisance, not
positively harm
ful. There are
some people who act as clogs in the
wheels of progress it does not take
long for a cog to become a clog.
Theer ."s a big bunch of human
clogs about and tis twice as hard
to go with them. I refer to this
bunch that thinks that anything
white is better than everything black
If they buy a pair of shoes from a
man once, that man becomes the in
timate friend of theirs for life if the
undertaker buried their grandmother
thirty years ago, and no one has
died since, he is the family under
taker, and thus it goes down the
line. The business smile of the white
man becomes a purely pei'Sonal one
with them, if he says, "How do you'
do today?" He shows great special
interest in their health. They will
walk all night to help some white
fellow who once took a drink with
them and would not go a block to
save a Negro from being evicted un
less there was a dollar tax with the
information. They will stand on the
corner an hour explaining why he
cannot spend ten cents at the colored
store and break his neck to buy
something from a white man that he
does not know what to do with.
Every doctor he gets is a specialist
and never sends him a bill every
lawyer he chases to death and has
the cash for has a special pull with'
the judge and jury and by some
means a Negro lawyer cannot under
stand the peculiar case in law. And
thus it goes on, anything white is
better than everything black.
The wheels of progress are made
to move slowly and usually this type
of man or woman is the one that is
very important in the church or
lodge they fawn and praise the very
men whose economic life they are
trying to stifle.
To praise a man and then take
ten dollars from him, especially when
you are not going to spend the mon
ey, is little worse than hitting him
over the head with a brick. As a
general thing the man that talks
most about race pride is talking
most about himself and keeps all he
can to himself, fearing evidently that
someone else would get something
to really equal him.
The man who spends his money
with the colored drug store, with the
colored grocery, with the colored law
years and doctors is doing more than
the fellow who makes a speech and
takes his money some other place.
It is an unfortunate condition that
the best people are apt to go first
and leave the grafters and wire pull
ers.
Boys are going to school first to
learn to read and write and make
good citizens secondly to make a liv
ing. If there are no business enter
prises among their o&n people they
stand poor chances of getting what
they deserve. This race pride is less
a matter of sentiment than it is of
dollars and centB.

EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
By John L. Thompson.
This year we again with pen in
hand and on the bicycle we have
started out on the long journey of
calling upon many of our subscrib
ers in the middle west to have (hem
pay up their subscription dues and
incidentally jot down a few lines as
to their progress and to note the
changes since we last reported. To
the average reader it would seem to
be the same old report as observed
last year, but not so, for within the
short space of one year there have
been many changes. The ruthless
hand of time and the inevitable fate
of man is ever changing. Hence we
are to note these changes. With an
other cold spring just ended and an
other cold summer to follow the foot
steps of last year we are again
tramping through a cold, drizzling
rain, which seems to have no end.
On leaving our home, the metropo
lis of Iowa, we first found a two
hours' stop over in Osceola, Iowa, a
beautiful town in southern Iowa,
named after an Indian tribe. This
town at one time was the shelter for
many fugitive slaves from Missouri.
Here now lives about thirty ^ored
people happily located, with one
church, A. M. E., with a Sunday
school doing well. Mrs. Anna Wil
liams is a pioneer settler here, high
ly respected. She has cooked for the
Howe hotel, the only hotel in the
town, for twenty-eight years, a good
sample of faithfulness to duty. Wal
ter Griffin is working in an automo
bile garage as a machinist. Frank
Bryant is city bus man and delivery
man for the Adams Express com
pany. Has worked for the Howe
hotel company for more than twen
ty-five years. He has recently mar
e.^Tfe
new subscribers are W. Griffin, John
and Mrs. J. A. Draden, Mrs. Ed
Shealley, L. M. Jackson and Frank
Holder. Mr. Holder is a plasterer by
trade, a new man here. L. W. Jack
son is a cement contractor from To
peka, Kans. He has all the work
that he can do. He is a fine me
chanic.
Creston was our next stop for two
hours. Here we first met the genial
face, though somewhat wrinkled
with age, of C. F. Burnaugh, who
has worked for the Summit hotel for
thirty years. He is known to every
traveling man in suthern Iowa. C.
R. Hawkins has opened a shining
parlor one year ago and is doing
well. Mr. and Mrs. H. Martin old
settlers here, who have spent about
half centugy here, have without
doubt one of the finest fruit and gar
den tracts of any person in Creston.
He owns about three acres in the
city, all covered with strawberries,
raspberries, gooseberries, cherries,
plums, apricots, peaches and apples,
and his trees are full. He is well
qualified. They are race loving peo
ple. "'The widow, Mrs. Anna Dow, is
still living on her little truck and
fruit farm of three acres and doing
well. Mr. E. Baldwin and brother
are still farming 500 acres of good
Iowa land two miles from town. They
have a large crop out this year.
At 10 o'clock we arrived in Clar
inda, Iowa. Here is located one of
our state institutions, the asylum. We
have about 300 colored citizens here,
with two churches, each about out of
debt, the Baptist under Rev. Mitchell,
which is being painted, also the par
sonage, and the A. M. E, under Rev,
D. W. Brown, an old soldier and pio
neer minister. He is doing nicely.
He has put on about $450 worth 1
repairs in raising the church up and
moving it over, filling in a ditch,
painting and putting on a vestibule
All work paid in advance. Ed Jones,
the cook for the Clarinda regimental
band, has been ordered out to go to
mobilize preparatory to going to the
front. Henry H. Cook, our merchant,
had his store and stock of goods
burned down and it was a complete
loss. He is now rebuilding, this time
a brick store, and will soon be in it.
Mr. G. N. Nowling has sold out his
lots in the southeast part of the city
and has bought a lot in the north
part and has built a new completely
modern seven-room cottage, a beau
tiful home, a credit to any race. Mr.
Nowling is a ypung, hard,• working
man.
His wife\ will represent the
thist year. Mirv
