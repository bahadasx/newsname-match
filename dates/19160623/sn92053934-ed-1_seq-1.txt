the Carrizal fight, based on stories
told by stragglers reaching the head
quarters of the American expedition
and on Mexican rumors, was taken to
the White house early today by Sec

The secretary said General Persh

Worry at Lark of News.
Officials i are greatly worried over
the delay in getiing news from sur

perior force of Mexicans. According
to Mexican official accounts there were
about 76 Americans, 17 of whom were
taken prisoner. Captain Charles T.
Boyd, Lieutenant Henry R. Adair and
10 men are said to have been killed.
Of ths remaining 47 only a few strag
glers reached General Pershing's

there had been no word from the two
cavalry troops sent out to get in touch
with them. ,
General Pershing said he hoped to
have a report from surviving officers
by courier during the day.

Mexico Case
New York. June 23. A movement
to rail a conference of American and
Mexican citizens at El Paso In an ef
fort to avert war with Mexico was an
nounced today by the American union
against militarism.
The union's executive committee,
after an all-night session, sent tele
grams to William Jennings Bryan,
David Starr Jordan and Frank P.
Walsh of Kansas City, urging them to
proceed at once to El Paso and offer
ing to defray their expenses, which,
it was stated, would be met by a fund
to be raised by "voluntary contribu
tions from Americans and Mexicans
alike."
Similar telegrams were sent to Dr.
Atl, editor of a Mexico City weekly;
Luis Manuel Rojas, director of the
national library at Mexico City, and
Modesto C. Rolland, a Mexican engin
eer in New York.
No date was set for the suggested
meeting. The purposes of the union
are not only to delay hostilities but
to promote mediation and relieve the
situation along the border.
Telegrams have been sent also to
the ambassadors of the ABC powers,
urging them to press for mediation
and to endeavor to influence Carranza
against war.
Identified with the movement are
Oswald Garrison Villaxd, Amos Pin

note from the Mexican minister of
foreign affars was received today at
the foreign office. It set forth the
opinion of the Mexican government
that war with the United States was
inevitable on account of the methods
employed by the American govern
ment and pointed out that all the re
public of Central and South America
would be affected by a conflict.
The Peruvian government returned
a carefully worded reply, couched in
friendly terms, expressing the hope
that peace would be maintained.
Buchanan Has Case Ready.
Washington, June 23. Representa
tive Ruchanan of Illinois, who brought
impeachment charges against United
States Attorney Snowden Marshall
after the latter had had him indicted
in New York in connection with the
activities of Labor's National Peace
council, appeared before the house
judiciary committee today and argued
that he had made out a case.
THE WAR TODAY
In Volhynia the Germans and
Anstrians hae taken the offen
sive against the Russians and ap
parently have stopped the Rus
sian drive westward.
Along the Slokhnd river in the
region of Sokiil heavy fighting is
in progress and the Russians claim
that the Teutonic allies have been
driven hack, while Berlin assert
that the ICnssians have been
forced to give way. In G&Jicia
the Bnssians continue their ad
vance and have captured Dadautz,
about lliirty miles south of Cater
nowitz, taking more prisoners and
guns.
Between the Pripet river marsh
es and Riga, the Germans have
started what seems to be a pen
eral offensive, heavily bombard
ing Russian positions or throw
ing infantry attacks against them.
The Kussiun official report de
clares that all of the Herman at
tacks in this region have failed.
In the vicinity of Verdun the
Hermans again are heavily bom
barding French positions, the at

Thiaiimont, the Yanx wood, being1
especially severe.
Greece has jielded to the ulti

FEAR HEAVIER LOSSES
Officials Believe That Cas

Exceed Reports.
Washington, Juno 23. Interest
was expressed by war department
officials in the nnnfheiaJ report that
Villa is at Escalon, Chihnahua
state, negotiating with the Car
ranza government for amnesty and
a commission in the Mexican
army.
Reports spread here that the 17
negTo troopers taken to Chihnahua
after the Carrizal fight were being
brought to Juarez to be turned over
to the American authorities. Con
sul Garcia said that if the report
were true he was not aware of it
San Arrtrmio, Tex., June 23. Fear
that the casualties suffered by Captain
Boyd's command had been very heavy,
was expressed by army officers here.
It was pointed out that if 12 men had
been killed as reported through Mexi
can sources, it would mean that from
35 to 40 had been wounded, according
to the usual proportion.
These with the number reported
from Chihuahua to have been captured,
would account for practically one
troop, or 50 per cent of the command
From reports available so far, it is by
I no means certain that Captain Boyd's
command was not practically wiped
out.
American (inns Command Border.
El Paso, Tex.. June 23. American
guns command the situation at every
important border point today. Field
artillery has been mounted on hillocks
in larger communities, the noses of
their guns pointing south, while in
smaller towns machine gun detach
ments have been stationed. Every
preparation had been made for possi
ble hostilities.
After waiting 48 hours the border
read news of General Pershing's re
port that the Carrizal fight was an un
provoked attack upon the Americans
and then lapsed into expectant wait
ing. General sentiment seemed to be
that peace or war with Mexico hangs
upon the report's reception in Wash
ington. General Bell Jr., commanding the El
Paso military district, said he had re
ceived no additonal orders from de
partmental headquarters.
Fear Felt for- Prisoners.
Grave apprehension was manifested
here for the safety of the 17 American
prisoners taken in the engagement
who are held by General Trevino in
Chihuahua City.
A few of the troops that evacuated
Juarez have returned. Early this
morning only a few scattering mili
tary patrols were on the streets.
General Francisco Gonzales command
ant, and Andres Garcia, consul at El
Paso, who recently has been sleeping
on the Mexican .side, were riding
through the streets on horseback, ap
parently making an inspection tour.
Street car traffic across the river,
which was stopped last night, was re
sumed today.
In the railway yards two troop
trains, with steam up, stood ready for
instant departure. On one of them
were loaded fifteen machine guns and
three 70-millimetre field pieces.
Kebels Respond to CalL
Mexican reports that General Alvaro
Obregon has issued a manifesto offer
ing to accept the services of all rebel
leaders in the event of hostilities with
the United States found some con
firmation in the fact that today some
Mexicans, who had been exiled for po
litical reasons, crossed into Juarez.
All of these, including General Mar
celo Caraveo, former adherent of
Orozco and Huerta and other former
minor factional leaders, seemingly
were in favor with the Mexican mili
tary authorities. It was said that Gen
eral Caraveo will leave tonight for
Chihuahua City, where General Ja
cinto Trevino will assign him to a
command.
General Gonzales declined to dis
cuss these reports other than to say
that "any Mexican, not an outlaw, is
welcome to his mother land today."
From several of the larger border
ports came reports that an embargo
is to be placed on the export of food
stuffs in large quantities. Customs
officials here declined to discuss the
reports.
Early today a rumor spread through
El Paso that a detachment of Genera
Pershing's command had engaged Car
ranzistas near Namiquipa. This was
denied by local military authorities

Germans Renew Gigantic
Assault in Champagne
and Verdun Sectors.
CLAIM ATTACKS FAIL
Paris Report Asserts Foe Is
Checked in Every Instance
Charge Mort Homme.
Paris, June 23. The Germans have
launched a heavy attack in the Cham
paign district Three violent assaults
on the French trenches in the region
of Mont Tetu were repulsed last night
after severe fighting with grenades
and bayonets, according to an official
statement issued by the war office to
day. West of the Meuse in the Verdun
sector the Germans again attacked
Hill No. 304 and there was lively in
fantry fighting near Dead Man's Hill.
There was heavy artillery fire all
night in this sector. It was particu
larly violent east of the Meuse around
the Vaux front.
The text of the communication fol
lows:
"In Belgium a destructive fire of our
batteries demolished certain organiza
tions of the enemy in the sand dunes.
"In the Champagne district yester
day evening following a bombardment
of our positions between Maisons-de
Champagne and Mont Tetu, the Ger
mans delivered three attacks upon our
trenches along a front of about twelve
hundred yards.
All Attacks Checked.
"Each one of these attacks waa
either checked by our curtain of fire
or repulsed with hand grenades. Some
groups of the enemy which at the third
endeavor had succeeded in penetrating
one of our advanced positions west of
Mont Tetu were immediately expelled
at the points of the bayonet. Ten pris
oners were taken by us. During the
night several surprise attacks against
small French posts northeast of Butte
de Mesnil were repulsed.
"On the left bank of the river Meuse
the Germans have renewed their ef
forts in the region of Hill 304. Two
attacks with hand grenades were
checked by the fire of our machine
guns. During the night there was
spirited rifle firing in the Avocourt
wood and at Dead Man's Hill. There
was also an intense bombardment in
the sectors of Esnes and Chattan-
courL
"On the right bank of the river there
was considerable activity on the part
of the artillery along our entire front
from the Meuse as far as Moulainville.
This was particularly noticeable in the
region west and south of Fort Vaux.
Here the enemy used to a considerable
extent shells which produced a gas
irritating to the eyes. At Espargcs a
minor German attack resulted in com
plete failure."

JAPS REFUSE TO
LEND MEXICO AID
Requests for Arms and Munitions Are
Turned Down by Tokio Govern
ment and Factories.
Tokio, June 23. "Of course any
claim that the Japanese government
will assist Mexicans with munitions
and arms is out of the question and
absurd," said Baron Ishii, foreign min
ister, to a correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press who asked him today for
his views on the Mexican situation.
The interview was sought on account
of declarations attributed to Mexicans
that assurances had been received
from Japan that munitions and other
assistance would be given to Mexico
in event of war with the United States.
"As for private Japanese companies
selling arms to Mexicans," the foreign
minister continued, "I conisder it ex
tremely improbable. As you know, all
available rifles and guns are being
furnished to Japan's allies to assist in
bringing the European war to a suc
cessful issue. And I fancy, though I
do not know, that munitions not avail
able for our allies may have found
their way to China during the revolu
tionary troubles.
"Let me say with all the emphasis
and earnestness at my command," said
the minister, "the Japanese nation sin
cerely hopes that armed conflict be
tween the United States and Mexico
may be avoided. Japan's interest in
America, north, central and south, be
ing essentially pacific and commercial.
any event bringing disturbances into
the American market would be felt
keenly in Japan.
"This is especially true at a moment
when the whole European trade is vir
tually closed to Japan and the Chinese
market is seriously upset."
Baron Ishii expressed surprise and
mystification when the correspondent
referred to General Ramon Iturbe, a
representative of General Carranza,
who was reported several weeks ago
to be on his way to Japan on a secret
mission. The baron declared he never
had heard of General Iturbe or his
projected visit. He explained that he
regarded the Carranza government as
the de facto government of Mexico and
that the usual relations with General
Carranza were being maintained.
Japan's interests in Mexico, he said,
were in charge of Secretary Ohta, for
merly attached to the Japanese em
bassy at Washington. He said he had
received no advices from Secretary
Ohta in regard to the present situa
tion. Colonel Manuel Romero, recent
ly appointed. minister to Japan by Gen
eral Carranza has reached this coun
try but has not had an audience with
theemperor and the baron said it was
impossible to state when he would be
received in audience. Any idea that
the Japanese government was inter
fering in the Mexican situation, he
declared, was as absurd as the idea
that munitions were being supplied.

Secretary Baker today is

all militia available immedi
ately upon their organization
without waiting for comple
tion of the mobilization of

The commanders were re

unit completes muster. Gen
eral Funston will indicate
where he wishes the forces

Springrfleld, IIL, June 23-Indl.
cations that some unit of the Illi
nois national guard may be mshed
to the Mexican border within the
next few days became evident here
today when preparations were
made to muster the state troops
info the federal sen-ice as speedi
ly as possible. Lieutenant Colonel
K. M. Lewi's inspector instructor
of the regular army, said that the
medical officers of the national
guard probably would be mustered
in today, and they would begin im
mediately to examine militia men
preparatory to mustering them in.
Dispatches from Washington last
night said that as soon as 5,000 state
troops have been mustered Into the
federal service they would be ordered
to the border.
Fifth and Sixth to Go.
The war department at the Wash
ington suggested to Governor Dunne
today that the skeleton regiments such
as the Fifth and Sixth infantry of the
Illinois national guard", be utilized to
fill ranks of regiments already mobil
ized. This will give the Fifth and
Sixth regiments the opportunity to go
to the front with other Illinois infan
try for which they have been clamor
ing.
Governor Dunne also received a tel
egram today from the secretary of the
navy, asking htm to discourage any
attempt among members of the Illi
nois naval reserve to quit that body
and join the cavalry troops, which
probably will have the first opportun
ity to go to the border.
Reason Sixth Wasn't Called.
General Dickson today explained
why the Fifth and Sixth regiments of
the Illinois national guard were not
included in the mobilization order. On
April 20 General Dickson was notified
by the war department that the regi
mental organization of these two units
had been "permanently abandoned"
because the Fifth lacked two companies
of the 12 necessary to make up a regi
ment and the Sixth, though comprised
of 12 companies, was deficient in the
number of men.
Both Governor Dunne and General
Dickson claim they have done every
thing within their power in an effort
to obtain the reinstatement of these
units as regiments, General Dickson
even making a trip to Washington for
that purpose.
Barry Cninfonned.
Chicago, June 23. Major General
Thomas H. Barry, commanding the
central department of the Unite!
States army, early today was without
official instructions from Washington
directing that as soon as 5,000 state
troops had been mustered into federal
service they were to be sent to the
border, but was momentarily expect
ing such orders.
It was said at department headquar
ters that mustering in of the Illinois
troops probably would be started to
day. It was believed that the First
cavalry of the Illinois guard would
be the first to receive this attention.
The one remaining Chicago regi
ment to go to Springfield, the Eighth,
composed of negro infantry, is under
orders to entrain toni&ht.
