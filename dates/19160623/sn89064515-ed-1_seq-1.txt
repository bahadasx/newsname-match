M. M. Williams appeared and called
the council's attention to matters per
taining to the park. He asked that
the west fence of the moose enclosure
be moved so as to bring a number of
large pine trees on the outside of the
corral. The reason, he explained, was
that if the trees are left inside the
enclosure they will be killed. In the
course of his talk Mr. Williams stated
that Little Falls is not doing one
fourth as much for its park system as
other towns of its size and even small
er in this state. Upon motion by Al
derman John the Park committee was
instructed to have the fence moved
and also to have a man clear out the
dead brush and stumps in the enclos
ures.

permit to repair the stairway at the
back of the building in which the
Union Provision company meat market
is located.
City Engineer Phil. S. Randall gave
a written report on the proposed paint
ing of the Broadway and north wagon
bridges. He said he had taken a
great deal of time to investigate par
ticularly the different kinds of paint
and that he had come to the conclusion
that B. P. S. Nob
rack bridge paint,
manufactured by tne Patterson-Sar
gent company, is the best, and recom
mended its use on the Broadway
bridge. For the north wagon bridge
he recommended the B. P. S red barn
paint. A representative of the Pat
terson-Sargent company was at the
meeting and he gave a long talk de
scribing the paint, its qualities, etc.
The estimate of Mr. Randall for the
painting of the Broadway bridge was
$483.25, of which $180.00 was for
cleaning and scraping it, $180.00 for
labor for painting it two coats of
paint and $123.25 for the paint, being
for 85 gallons at $1.45 rer gallon. For
the north bridge his estimate was
$279.00, of which $69 was for the
paint and the balance for cleaning
and scraping and painting it. The
council decided to buy the paint re
commended by Mr. Randall and the
clerk was instructed to advertise for
bids for the work.
Clarence Sheedy, son of Mrs. Mar
garet Sheedy of Randall, underwent
an operation for removal of tonsils,
and is doing nicely.

Leon Dugas of Ripley, was operated
upon for appendicitis at St. Gabriel's
hospital yesterday morning.

steps.

KELLOGG WINS SENATORSHIP
NOMINATION AND KNUTSON
CONGRESSIONAL
Local candidates fared badly in the
senatorial and congressional races in
Monday's primaries, Congressman
Lindbergh running fourth in the sena
torial race and C. B. Buekman running
third in the congressional contest.
Frank Kellogg gets the republican
nomination for senator over Eberhart
by over 20,000. Clapp is third with
Lindberg close up.
Harold Knutson of St. Cloud, for
merly of Boyalton, is nominated by the
republicans for congress by a Dig lead.
The vote in 302 precincts is Knutson
5,565 Rogers 3,986 Buekman 3,595.
Knutson's main opponent in the gen
eral election will be Attorney Wm. F.
Donohue, democrat, of Melrose.
Other nominees on the republican
ticket are J. A. A. Burnquist, gover
nor Frankson, lieutenant governor
Schmahl, secretary of state Rinps,
treasurer Mills, railway and ware
house commissioner.
On the democratic ticket Lawler
was an easy winner for senator.
Dwyer of Minneapolis sprung a sur
prise by getting away with the demo
cratic nomination for governor. King
is running second with Works third.
The Dwyer showing is due a good deal
to the light democratic vote cast, the
labor part of it going to cue Minnea
polis boilermaker, he getting a big
lead in the twin cities and other labor
towns. Thorson is evidently the nom
inee for lieutenant governor.
For justices of the supreme court
Anderson and Quinn appear to be the
nominees.
For county commissioners Berglund
and Rebischke will contest in the gen
eral election for commissioner ,n the
First district Rocheleau and Moran
in the the Second district and Gassert
and LaFond in the Third district.

FAST GAME BOOKED FOR SUNDAY
—CHICKEN TO PITCH FOB
VISITORS
Sunday afternoon, at the fair
grounds, the Little Falls team will
clash with the fast Yerdale team. The
game, according to all indications, will
be one of the fastest of the season, as
the Yerdale aggregation is a strong
one, composed mostly ot paid players.
The game will probably be a pitch
ers' battle, with Gourd on the mound
for Little Falls and Chicken twirling
for the visitors. Chicken is one of the
best pitchers in this section of the
state. Last year he played with Long
Prairie and helped that aggregation
through a wonderful season.
Williams, former captain of the Min
neapolis league of the American asso
ciation, will be seen in the game again
Sunday. He will no doubt occupy the
second sack, as usual.
A good sized crowd should turn out
for the game Sunday and help the lo
cal boys win. The management is un
der a heavy expense and large crowds
are needed to maintain a team like
the one Little Falls now has. It is
hoped that a record crowd will turn
out Sunday. The game will be called
at 3:30 p. m.

Agricultural society, in regard to the
use of the fair grounds for holding
shoots. The traps are now located on

unless they .can make satisfactory ar
rangements for the use of the fair
grounds the committee has power to
lease or purchase other grounds fer the
traps.
