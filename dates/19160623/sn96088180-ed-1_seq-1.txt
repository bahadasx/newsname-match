General Tersblng on the Carrlxal
battle. His report, de-coded early to

putting responsibility fori the affair
upon the Mexicans. The full official

was expected from Oeneral Pershing
during the day. , .
Meantime activity centered In
getting mllltla troops ready for bor

gathered from the central and west

as they can be prepared. Probably
this will be In a very few days. Tbe

as It Is definitely established how
many were captured, official atated

The returning cavalrymen are un
derstood to have told 'Pershing that
the Mexicans were ut fault In the
trouble. Army men generally said
today that they did noi believe the
Carrlxal Incident, by Itself, will pro

themselves as believing war can not
be avoided ultimately.
Following a lS-mlnute conference
with President Wilton, Secretary of
War Baker said no change In policy
Is contemplated. The administration

Secretary Baker refused to make
public the text of Pershlng'a message,
on the ground It waa not offlclal and
tbat Pershing regarded It as In' the
"rumor" class.
Americans In Guanajuato state are

Saionoff had just returned front the

'.'Germany," sold the foreign min

Now having signally failed to beat
Europe Into submission, and finding
her Intended victims getting the up

the mask of piety and endeavors to
throw upon the allies the blame for

weakness and an attempt to hide her

which I believe the world will soon
realise, If It does not already.

In the advance of the Russian front,
as well as by successes of the clash

"The war can end but one way.

never so united as now and never so

"We wish peace as ardently as any

Peace must be permanent, which
means that Prussian militarism must
go. After all, It is this militarism we

United States.
"I see no obstacle in the way of
the closest .relations," he replied.
"The Idea has my hearty support. I
share your able ambassador's ex
pressed views on the subject. We
need only get better acquainted."
Discussing the Polish situation, the
minister said he greatly appreciated
America's -steps to feed the unfor

"The population there is badly
treated by the enemy," he added.
"They continue to remove all avail

suffering . Russia already has shown
her appreciation of endeavors to re

enter the country,' despite the fact
that Germany might take advantage
of the situation to divert a part of
the supplies to her use. I regret
deeply that Germany has refused to
agree not to remove foodstuffs al

TO REPRESENT
is. ran codes
Washington, June 23. Tbe United
States government has asked Great
Britain to look after American in
terests, through her diplomats In
Mexico, in the event of war, it was
officially admitted today.
This request was explained as not
being indicative of immediate trouble,
hut rather as a precaution should war
transpire. Such moves are custom
ary when trouble threatens between
two governments. England waa se
lected because she has extensive in
terests and numerous representatives
In Mexico and her consequent ability
to look after whatever might arise.

Huddleston of Alabama and Lon-'

Hay's resolution providing 30 t

that some provision be made for

on a point of order.
Washington, June 23. With re
publicans, led by Congressman Mann,'
demanding expl'dt expression from
the president as to bis reasons for
sending the militia to the border.
with power to order them Into Mex
ico. Chairman Hay of the house mili
tary affairs committee, this afternoon,.
began his fight to make the national
guard actually a federal force.
Opposition to the resolution, be
cause President Wilson has not ap
peared before congress In person to
explain tbe situation, seemed to grow
rapidly. Congressman Gardner asked
that the whole matter be postponed
for consideration until tomorrow.,
Hay pressed for. immediate consid
eration.' .''':! 'I. ' -
Declaring the action would " not
constitute a declaration of war, nor
an admission that a state of war ex
ists. Hay brought the matter up Im
mediately upon the convening of the
house. He asked the 'house to con
sent to changes in the resolution, in'
effect placing on congress the re
sponsibility for drafting the mllltla.
Hay asked that the language of the
draft empowering the president to
draft mllltla be made to read:
"That In the opinion of the con
gress of the United States, whereas
an emergency now exists which de
mands the nBe of troops In addition
to the regular army, the president Is
hereby authorised to droit Into the
United States army, any or all. the
members of the national guard."
Republican Leader Mann objected
to having placed on congress the
responsibility of declaring that an
emergency exists, unless President
Wilson should directly or Indirectly
assure the house that such is the
case. " '
"I am authorised," replied Hay,
"to say that the president believes
an, emergency 1s present and It Is
absolutely necessary to command the
service of the mllltla."
Continuing, Mann said: '
"I do 'not know whether the
troops should be kept in Mexico or
not. It Is 'evident that the troops
can not remain in the heart of the
country without , there being a cer
tain amount of friction with Mexi
cans.' I can not see why they are
being kept In Mexico when they have
not accomplished what they set out
to do."
An amendment by Walsh shifting
responsibility to President Wilson for
calling the mllltla was defeated by
a vote of 123 to 24. The Hay amend
ment' declaring that congress con
siders an emergency present, requir
ing the use of the military, was car
