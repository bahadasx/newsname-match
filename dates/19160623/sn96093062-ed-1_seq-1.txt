The work of assessing property In
Bryan County for taxation the cur
rent year is complete and Assessor
YeattB has certified "the values as
fixed by tho County Board or Equalization.
The total valuations nro $10,543,
078, of which amount real estate
(farm lands) come in for $4,803,796,
town lots for $2,846,137 and person
al property $2,875,145.
According to the certificates 295,
514 acres of land wero rendered for
taxation, representing an average
value including Improvements of
$16.30 per acre. 15,123 town lots
wore rendered, the average of ""which
with improvements is $188.00.
It will bo interesting to note the
average values of various classes of
property as shown by tho rendition.
Horses, $52.26; mules, $69.92; cat
tle, $17.28; sheep, $2.00; goats,
$1.22; Swine, $5.14; Wagons, $19.
75; carrla'ges, $20.35; bicycles, $5;
watches, $9; pianos, $87.21.; type
writers, $82.77; dogs, $19.
Ono strange feature of the thing 1b
that the average value of dogs 13
more than three times tho average
value of dogs, fifteen tlmos greater
than tho value of goats, nine tlmea
greater than the value of cattle, and
almost as groat as tho average value
of buggies and wagons.
Another peculiar thing is that on
ly ono bicycle was rendered for tax
ation; still other oddities are that
there were only $740 worth of wagon
scales, ferries and toll bridges. No
judgments or tax certificates, no
stocks orbonds or investments in do
mestic corporations, only $63,000 In
mouey on hand, only 104 typewriters,
only $50 worth of gold and silver
plate, only 795 watches and only 9
adding mnclnes.
Assessments are slightly lower
than last year, but the difference is
easily explained. Automobiles,
which in this county run Into many
thousands of dollars, are no longer
assessed by county assessors and as
a result do not show on county tax
books. Cotton and grain on hand aiv
not subject to taxation, and general
exemptios aro greater than a year
ago.
Active work was begun this week
in connection with tho Durant Na-'
tlonal Bank's plan t6 erect a moderur
bank'btilldlng on its lot at thVnorth
west corner of Second Avonuo and
Main Street. The tenants in the build
ings on this lot have vacated and tho
small buildings on the back of the
lot have all been wrecked and the
work of wrecking the large building'
will begin at once. The plans for the
now building are being comploted as
rapidly as possible. Mr. XI B: Mc
Cart, who built the union station in
this city, has been awardod tho con
tract and is now getting ready to' do
this work.
It is stated that the new bank'
building will be one of the most com-'
plete and modern banking houses in
Oklahoma. The lot has a width of
thirty-three feet anil the building will'
extend back U distance of one hun
dred feet, while the remaining space
between the bank and the alloy., will
bo built in with a two-story building .
to be cut up into offices. The bank
building will be two stories in height
and devoted exclusively to the Durant
National's own use. The fixtures
will be arranged with a lobby in tho
middle, on the west side bolng tho
teller's cages and bookkeping depart
ment. On the right hand'slde the of
ficers' quarters and note -teller's cage
will be. located. Mezzanine floors
will be placed at front and back end
of the banking room, while te inter
vening space will be used-for a large
skylight, which will give ventilation
and light in tho working quarters of
the bank. That portion of the mez
zanine floor in front. will be devoted
to. a dlrectlrs' room, which will be
not only large chough to take care of '
thtiUjS&di of the- directors, but also
will afford a convenient place for the .'
meeting of business men and public
organizations of any kind which' may :
find it convenient to meet there.
There will bo a vault in the basement.,
for storing purposes and .on, the main
floor will bo a vault 12x15 -feet in -size,
wher.e will, be kept the bank's
money safes and. also safety boxes for
the use of Its 'CUBtoW.rs. Tho walls
of" the vault .will be constructed of
concrete and railroad Iron and lined
with Bessemer steel. The opening in
this vault will be protected by a mas
sive round door, which will add much
to the appearance of the interior-of
the building. A second-story vault
will be on the mezzanine floor, in
which will be stored the bank's obso
lete records and stationery Evfery,
modern convenience will be Installed
which will facilitate the officers and
employees In waiting on the bank's
customers. A private branch tele
phone exchange will be put in with
two main line connections to the cen
tral office. A ladies' rest room will
be one of the modern features of the
building. The building will be heat
ed by a furnace.
The exterior of tho banking room
will be of Bedford or Carthage stone
and the front of the building will be
graced by columns extending the full
height of the building, while the en
trance will be set back in a rece&a
about five feet.
The directors of tho bank are mak
ing an effort to get tho building com
pleted by January 1, and unless
weather, conditions are unfavorable,
it is believed this can be done.
It Is expected that tho cost of the
building with Inside furnishings and
fixtures will reach $50,000.
