CAMPAIGN FOOIiIBIINESS.
In every stirring campaign there is sure
to be more or less foolishness. There nro
many men and some newspapers that in
the excitement of the hour lose the sense
of propoition and propriety and make
statements which are of no help to their
candidates and do no harm to their op
ponents. Their conduct simply shows that
for the time being they nro to a certain
extent inesponsible, with the result that
if they make a sensible movement or state
ment it is to n greater or, lesser extent
counteracted by their thoughtlessness and
foolishness.
One very foolish outbreak has already
been made, and this by .1 body of minis
ters of the gospel. At a meeting of the
Baptist Ministers' association in Philadel
phia the other day one of the mcmbets ex
claimed, "Thank God, our next president
will be a liaptist!" This was followed by
a storm of applause which, according to
, , . . . ...
(lespaten, -mauc me session seem iikc a
political convention after the nominee had
been picked. Tho pastors cheered, many-
lose from their seats and applauded, ami
all clapped their hands. The ovation con
tinned for three minutes."
With all respect to the ministry it is
within bounds to say that this was a
thoroughly ridiculous performance. It
was natural for the men assembled to take
a certain pride in tho factthat the Repub
lican candidate for president is identified
with their denomination .but to attach
importance to that foctjVMthc height of
folly. , .PK!$r ',
:'Mr-jTushrjLif"il""rrcsi(len
Wilson is 'a PrcsbyterwW but the cam
paign is not to be waged along denomina
tional lines. Tho candidates nro high-
minded Christian gentlemen1 and tie cam
paign, so far as, they arc personally con
coined, will bo dignified and straightfor
ward. Their work will not lack vigor, but
there will bo no clap-trap about it, and it
would be well for the country if the rank
and file of the woil.ers on both sides would
follow the example that will be het by
their leaders.
The less chucklir'g there is over the fact
that one of the calUidates is a liaptist and
the other a Presbyterian the better it will
be. Such a consecration has no more
hearing on the qucjtion at issue than the
fact that one of the men wears whiskers
and the other duofi not. The character
and ability of thel candidates will invite
the voters of the country to a high level
in the coming campaign, and thcie will be
no excuse if they fail to rise to it.
Bond overseers and supervisors have
a hard stniKKlo in many places to keep
in oven passable condition the roads
which run through stretches of low,
marshy ground. In spite of all they
enn do with the hide ditches, tho
mount of water in tho adjacent land
is so great that every heavy rain causes
mud holes. There is nn inexpensive
remedy for this condition in some
enscs, n lemedy which many farmers
are always nppl.iinf; to drain their
lands. Tho accumulation of water is
duo to an insuffn iont channel to drain
it nwny, even wh"a thoro is n winding,
choked brook or "branch" through
tho land. If thi.- channel weic straight
nnd free from obstruction to a placo
where tho water would run away readi
ly, tho land would bo drained. To
dig such n new channel is usually too
expensive for tho farmer or tho road
overseer, Hint there is another easier
and chenper way to construct it in
many cases. This is to blast n chan
nel through tho marsh with dynamite.
Occasionally, where tho wntcr is held
on the surface by n layer of clay a few
feet thick, overlying n bed of gravel
or other p"voiiB material, it is cheaper
to blast i- large hole through tho clay
to the porous iniiteriiil. The hole must
then bo iilhd ith stone, brush and

ON THE BRINK OF WAR
National Guard of Country Called
Out for Mexican Border Duty
Threatening Conditions Along Bounda
ry Caused President to Tako Action
Amoricans Killed in Clash.
The United States is on the bt ink of
war with Mexico.
Mecaiiho of tliieatcniiig conditions along
the international boundary President
Wilson through .Secretary of War Baker
issued orders Sunday for the mobilization
of the entire national guaid of the coun
try. Sinec then militia regiments have
been gathering at various state eanipM.
and as soon as possible after they aie
mustered into the federal service they
will be sent to Texas for patrol duty along
the Rio Grande. The militia strength
of the United States amounts to about
12o,000 men.
No olfeiiMvc attack on Mexico is
planned, but. the administration wants a
military force adequate to defend the bor
der against bandit raids and to act in case
General Carranza should carry out his
threat to attack the American expedition
ary forces engaged in chabing bandits
south of the border.
A note flatly rejecting Carranza's dc
mand for the withdrawal of United States
troops from Mexico was forwarded to the
First Chief Tuesday. Tho message also
rebuked tho Carrariza government for the
discourteous tone of its last communica
tion, and stated further that anv move
against this country would meet with the
gravest consequences. Up to last night
np reply to tho note had been received.
aslungton omcials have admitted tiri
vatcly that they fear war, although it is
known that leprescntatives of foreign
powers arc using their utmost endeavors
to prevent a break,
A detachment of American cavalry
clashed with Curranza forces at C'arrizal,
00 miles south of El Paso, early Wednes
day, according to a report to the Mexican
military authorities at Juarez, the Mexi
can town acioas the Rio Giande from
El Paso.
According to the ofiicial announcement
made at the Mexican consulate yestctday
the Americans lost 12 killed including
their commander and 17 prisoners, while
the Mexican losses were 14 killed and HO
wounded. The announcement said that
complete details had been iceeived from
Villa Ahumad.i, the Mexican field head
quai'tcis ill uoi thei u Chihuahua, but the
name of the Aineiicaii commander was
not given. The Americans are said to
have leinoved their uounded with them.
SENATOB rACE.
United Slates Senator Can oil S. Page
will meet with opposition if he decide to
be a candidate for re-election. Wo use
the "if" as a matter of piccntition, for al
though theie are many indications that
the gentleman fiom Hyde P.uk has a con
suming desiio to retain to Washington for
another term he has yet to take the peo
ple of the state into his confidence le
garding his aspirations. Some folks pio
fess to be annoyed at Senator Page's atti
tude but very few, if any, are surprised.
Yeimont's junior senator lias never won
a leputation for coming out flat-footed on
any issue, and it is only natural that he
should conduct his campaign for rc-elec
tion along the lines that havo marked his
course in Congress. Ho has written him
drcds of letters in an cHort to "ascertain
the attitude" of his constituents nnd has
inquiiod about the rates for political ad
vei tising in the state newepapeis, but
nothing has coine to our attention that
ichcinbleH an ollieial declaration of his can
didacy. As for tho Page opposition it is safe t
say that it will be found in the person of
ex dov. Allen M. Fletcher of Cavendish
Mr. Fletcher has yet to make an ollitial
announcement, but evidence that he plans
to do so befoie long is incie.ising steadilj
Gov. Charles V. Gates also is said lo have
an eye on Senator Page's seat, while nu
merous other names have been mentioned
in connection with the scnatorship fight.
Whatever may be the outcome of the
campnicn it is safe to say thnt Senator
Pago 1ms no great hold on the Republican
voters at this end of tho state. Activo
opposition to his candidacy may not exist
at present but tho oppoilunity to.oiganuo
it wails only upon publicity.

Company I, V. N. C.-Ciipt. Ernest
V. Gibson comiiiandinf:, in common
with all of the National Guard organ

munilng to u enll for mobilization, and
the work of recruiting it to war

call for Company 1 of tho Vermont Na
tional uuaril, and such us did remem
ber that the arrangement was made a
year ago, when the lirst inkling of
irouhlc with -Mexico was heard, had
torgotten it.
. But most of the mombcrs of Com
pany I, within hearing of the whistle
and bell, realized what it meant and
recalled tho prophecy of Capt. E. W.
Gibson of tho company at drill last
week Thursday night that ho beliovcd
that within a short timo tho company
wouiu uo canea upon for nctivo duty
and Tie wished" the" men prepared.-' "i"
Capt. Gibson, himself; knew Sunday
evening that a call was liable to come
(luring tho ifiglit. Ho returned during
tho early evening from Chester, whero
he had motored with his family to
spend the day with relatives of Mrs
Gibson. He had met Attorney General
Herbert (i. Barber who had heard from
a high state official that the call wa3
to go out during tho night.
As the Brattleboro members of the
company continued to reach the Ar
mory and get into held uniforms, oth

been readied hy telephone and te'e-

Springfield brought bergcant John .J.
Clunc, one of tho two veterans of the
Spanish-American war service, who
had answered tho call from Northamp
ton, Mass., where he is now employed.
From Vernon came two of the bovs,
who were brought to the Armory by. II.
A. Stateii in an automobile. Almost
at the same time a telephone message
was received from Putney that another
member who was working theie had
iceeived word and was leaving by au
tomobile. And so it was nil through
tho morning hours.
Not only were members of the com
pany responding to the call, but young
men who had never seen service nnd
who had never felt the call of joining
tho organization wore hurrying to tho
Armory and asking to be examined
and accepted as recruits. By the time
liieut. H. W. Taylor, assistant surgeon,
had reported there several were await
ing his examination and two were ac
cepted early while many more were re
jected. Amonj the latter was a for-

that further Instructions would bo is

orders to recruit tho company to full

five hours n day until further orders
and that when tho company left foi

Burlington to mobilize as a regiment
all state and federal property of tho
company should be taken.
Tho men were formed us a company
Monday forenoon and tho articles of
war lead to them as required. They
wore then permitted to disperse to
their h&iucs for dinner and ordered to
report at 2 o'clock at tho Armory,
for three hours of drill.
Major L. 1). Taylor was desig
nated to check up all stores and prop
erty of every kind, federal and state,
that the companies do not take into
the field. He has visited all the com
pany headquarters in the state for
that purpose.
Tuesday morning the company was
early at the work of drill, being in
command of Lieut. Hpauhling, and
woi king on the streets and the com
mon in company formation. Squads of
rookies were constantly under instruc
tion in the Armory.
Tolcgrnphic orders for tho departure
of Company S, V. N. G., for the state
camp ground near Burlington were ic
eeived Wednesday at 0.0!) o'clock by
Capt. Ernest W. Gibson.
Changes took placo rapidly in
tho company. Tho two veterans of
the Spanish-American war who were
members of the company when th" call
to arms was sounded, were discharged
from the service Tuesday, They
were Sergt. John J. Clune and George
Martin. Both men nrc employed out
of the state and each has a family of
several children.
Bugler Edward Lindsoy was pro
moted to n sergenncy Tuesday and
1'rivate Wilfred Adams, u former
bugler in the regular cavalry, who en
listed Monday, was made bugler.
The Modern Woodmen of America,
in a meeting Tuesday, voted to
continue iu inembiirship without as
sessments such members of the order
as aro members of the company.
Arrangements were completed for a
big reception Wednesday night at Is-
llnnd park, llorton Walker guaranteed
expenses for music and cvervone was in
vited to attend and give the soldier boys
a farewell they will long remember. Danc
ing was free and overyono was wel

There was no "dearth of woman's

ing when Company I, 83 men nnd

officers, with six members of the First
Regiment band boarded the second sec
tion of train 11, to leave for the Rtate
camp ground. The train was due to
leave Brattleboro at S.fj.'t o'elork, but
diil not pull out of tho stntioii until
o.:ift.
The second section was a special
trnin consisting of one baggage car and
six coaches, which was to pick up tho
Bellows Falls and Springfield companies
on the way to Burlington. It followed
as "oon after the regular train as
the company could get aboard.
There wns no cheering when the en
gino finally began to move the train.
Women and children wept openly, as
many of them hnd been doing during
the long wait at tho station. Men,
standing on the platforms, on the side
track, on the tops of freight cars and
on the ledge of Vernon street, raised
their lints and said, many of thorn in
an ordinary tono of voice that carried
oulv a few feet: "Good-bye and good
luck."
Tho crowd has beon variously esti
mated, but considering the tremendous
.jam at the station proper nnd the
crowd that watched the departure from
many antago points both close to and
niori remote from the station, it is
fnir to claim that 3,000 of the popula
tion of Brattleboro with a large sprink
ling of people from neighboring towns
said farewell to the boys.
bile the company wns mustering iu
the Armory that morning and the last
buckles were being fastened, the
last look taken iu the lockers to mnke
sure that nothing had been left behind,
a bulletin wns received of a fight that
took place between regular troops of
the I nited States nnd Cnrrnnzn sol
diers. It sorved, when tho nows be
came known nt the railroad station af
ter the nrrival of tho compnny there,
to add a touch of even grcnter serious
ness. But it did not effect the hoys
iu khaki. They have felt from tiio
first that they would not be long in
Burlington but would soon be on their
way back through Brattleboro to some
point on the Texas border. There had
boon no skylarking; not much fooling
