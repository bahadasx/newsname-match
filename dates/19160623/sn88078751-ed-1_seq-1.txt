WOULD AVERT NATIONAL GALL
Immediate Enlistment of Thousands
Urged to Uphold the Honor and
Tradition of Ohio Commercial
Bodies Also Take Up the Cause.
Progress Reported From Camp
Willis Mustering Officers Named.
Columbus, June 22. Appeals to pa
triotism and pleas for the immeJIate
enlistment of thousands of troops, to
uphold the honor and tradition of
Ohio, were made by Governor Willis,
national guard officers, commercial
and civic organizations and other
agencies.
Adjutant General Hough called upon
the military committee of the Colum
bus chamber of commerce to enlist
the co-operation of all similar organ
izations in the state. The Ohio Manu
facturers' association sent letters to
its 1,500 members requesting them to
encourage employes to enlist by guar
anteeing them restoration to their
present positions and, if possible, fuil
pay during the period of state or fed
eral service. Many have responded.
Governor Willis issued this call for
volunteers: "The call to arms has
been sounded. Men are needed in th
service of vtheir country. Ohio is ra
home of -patriots. Her battle flags al
ways have been in the van. Let Ohio-
ans not falter now. Buckeye tradi
tions must be preserved. Enlistments,
are needed to fill up every Ohio or
ganization to its war strength."
It is 'explained that this is not a;
formal call for volunteers, which only
the president of the United States,
upon authorization of congress, could
issue. It is a step to avert. If possi
ble, the necessity of a national call
for volunteers.
Excellent progress is reported from
Camp Willis, where 400 men are busy
putting it into condition for the recep
tion of troops. Plans were not to
order any troops to the camp until
its sewage, water, telephone and oth
er services are complete. It was inti
mated at the adjutant general's office
that orders to move to the mobiliza
tion camp will not be given this Week,
although t"ie camp will be ready for
some troops tomorrow.
The war department notified the ad
jutant general that mustering officers
have been appointed for the Ohio
troops. It Is expected the mustering
officers will come to Columbus Tues
day, when all Ohio troops are er
pected to "iave arrived at Camp Wil
lis. Beside mustering all Ohio offi
cers and enlisted men individually
into federal service, these federal of
ficers alo will have to take over all
the clothes, ammunition, equipment"
and the 'ike now be'onaing to the"
state. Everythine will have to be in
