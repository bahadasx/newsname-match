SUICIDE OF FORMER
LOUISA DENTIST.
DR. QUISENBERRY TAKES HIS
OWN LIFE NEAR HOPKINS
VILLE, KENTUCKY.
Last week we bad brief mention of
the suicide of Dr. (Julsenberry, a den
tist formerly located in Louisa. He
married Mias Allle Ault. of Grayson, s
cousin of Mrs. T. 8. Thompson.
The following is from tho Cadiz Rec
ord of last Thursday:
It. 8. V. Vuisenberry. a young- den
tist of Cerulean Fi-ringm, committed
suicide Tuesday afternoon about J.J'-
by shooting himself in the mouth with
a pistol.
For several days Dr. Qulsenberry
had been mors or leas despondent, snd
t Is supposed financial matters were
the cause of his trouble. He had not
been missed until supper time Tues
day eftemoon. When he failed to reach
his boarding- bouse st supper time,
some Inquiry was made. Later Mra
QutenteiTy and other friends became
alarmed, a search ti led to locate him.
No trace of him having teen found by
eleven o'clock, suspicions were aroused
among his fr ends, snd after a search
about the town, bis lifeless body was
found in the hay l ft of Dr. J. G
White s stock barn. He had been dead
f.r several hours. A 12 automatic pis
tol lay by his side. He had shot himself
:n the mouth, and death was almost In
stantaneous, from all appearances.
lr. White remembered hearing a gun
shot of some sort about three-thirty In
the afternoon and after the dead body
of Dr. Qulsenberry had been fousd. he
mas convinced that the shot he heard
waa the one that ended the earthly ex
istence of the young dentist.
Dr. Qulsenberry moved to Hopklns
rille shout three years ago from Lou
isa. Ky, snd lived there two years. He
had lived at Cerulean about a year and
occupied the office with Dr. White. He
was thirty-four years of age. and Is
survived by a wife and two little chil
dren, a son and a daughter? His moth
er snd brother live in Winchester.
Dr. Qulsenberry had made many
friends during the stay of a year at Ce
rulean, and his tragic death la much
regretted by those who knew him.
The burial took place at Winchester.

GRADUATES ARE ENTERTAINED.
High School Class Spend tho Day
Ploaaant Country Homo.
Saturday, Juno 17th, will live long in
the memory of tho senior class of the
Lawrence County High Reboot, 191 .
The occasion which makes this day
memorable to the members of the class
Is the visit which they made to the
beautiful country home of Mrs. Martha
Roberts at Cadmus, this county, upon
the invitation of her duuxhter. Miss
Marie and Miss Elizabeth Woods. The
start waa made about nine-thirty a.m.
from the home of Miss Lou Chain n. It
mo, u (red three motor cars for the con
veyance of the party. Tbey arrived
about 11 o'clock and were warmly
creeled by the charming hosts. Delic
ious lemonade was Immediately serv
ed, greatly to the enjoyment of the vis
itors. This refreshment was served oh
the spacious lawn, where, from tree
and shrub, gay pennons of the class
colors, old rose and green, floated in
the breeze. The pleasant hours of the
forenoon were passed In making kodak
pictures and listening- to piano music
rendered by the many players In the
party. When the summons to dinner
came the guests seated themselves at
a tattle which was covered with viands,
tho mere thought of which makes one's
mouth water. Every substantial and
delicacy which hospitable hearts could
think of and money procure was In
enea-ous abundance, skillfully pre par
ed asd roost tastefully served. Here
again the colors of the class were beau
tifully shown. The spacious dining
room had been darkened, candles of
old rose and green taking the place of
the sunlight. The class motto "And
then 7" was also to be seen.
At the conclusion of the feast, for
feast it was. the party visited an old
oil well, making koduk pictures "here,
there, and every where." About 4 o'clock
delicious ice cream, cake and punch
were served. About six o'clock Uie re
turn fur home began and was safely
made. Neither the out going trip nor
the homeward journey was marred by
any incident or accident. Even the
weather, hitherto so disagreeable, was
perfect. Cloud-ships changing- shape
and direction, at the will of the sum
mer wind, sailed the ether blue, but no
cloudbursts spoiled dainty dross of the
belles or dampened the ardor of the
beaux. True, the traveling waa a little
rough in places, but nothing more could
bo expected from Lawrence county
roads. The party consisted of the fol
lowing- gradutes:
Garnet ' See. Nora Sammona, Lou
Chaffl n, Elisabeth Conley, Sue Brom
ley. Fay Adams, Helen Vinson, Rebecca
Garred. Gua Snyder, James Hughes,
Wm. Vault ban. Earl Justice, Dixie By-
lngton. Georgia Byington.
.: Other Guests.
Frank Kins tier. Nellie Kinstler. Jen

Carter, Grace Eammons and Lucile

Three members of this year's class
were taking the county teachers ex
s mi nation and could not go. They were
Misses May Summon, and Marie Holt
and Mr. George Bishop.
There were not enough young- men
present for every young- woman to have
a chap-of-her-own, so Mrs. George R
Vinaon, of this city chaperoned the
party.

The Baltimore ac Ohio railroad com

The Long- Fork railway Is a sub
sidlary line of tho Baltimore & Ohio,
extending; from tho forks of Beaver
creei in Floyd-co, Ky, about eight
miles from Frestonsburg; on the Big

numerous changes in . the channel of

The letting of contracts for the Long
Fork marks the first actual construe.
Hon of the Baltimore & Ohio in this
territory. This company has had
corps of engineers actively at work
making studies and surveys for the pant
live years. It Is reasonable to assume
that the construction of this line Is but
the beginning of tho many plans being
considered by the Baltimore & Ohio.
At the present time they own the
Sandy Valley and Elk Horn, a thirty-flve-mlle
line running; from Jenkins,
Lelcber-co, Ky, tho Consolidation CoeuV
company city, to Shelby, where the ton-
nags Is turned over to the Chesapeake

will likewise be turned over to the
Chesapeake A Ohio at the forks of Bea

Hamilton and Dayton railway.the great

these two railroads will be lake coal.
The surveys made by the Baltimore

across the Ohio river at Huntington
and thence via the Symmes creek val
ley to a connection with the Cincin
nati, Hamilton and Dayton and the
Baltimore A Ohio railways, near Chil-
Urntho, O.
It Is to be hoped that this actual con
struction marks the actual beginning of
4he contemplated work and that with
in a reasonable time the long looked
for bridge across the Ohio river
Huntington will be built.
E. K. RAILROAD MAY BE
PURCHASED BY B. . O.
Concerning a rumor that the B. A O.
railway company was negotiating for
the purchase of tho E. K. Railway
which runs from Ri vert on to Webb
vllle. Ky, and that the deal would soon
be consummated, the Wei 1st on Sentinel
has the following of interest:
"This carries out the Sentinel's pre
diction that the B. O, would flnally
bridgo the Ohio and extend a line thru
Eastern Kentucky to connect with Its
aolted coal road, the Sandy Valley,
that runs from Shelby to Jenkins. The
E. K. road is 35 miles long snd has valu
able leases and rights of way from
Webbville to Pound Gap, Va, a dis
tance of IIS miles, which it has been
protecting for many years. This road
lost its fine general office building by
fire about three weeks ago.
"The E. K. road was one of the first
railways built west of the Alleghany
mountains, for the purpose of handling
the iron of several charcoal furnaces
long since gone out of blast. The names
of these two furnaces are well known
to many of the old colliery and furnace
men of this section. Pennsylvania and
Hunnewell were tamed for the excel
lency of their products. This little road
has always been most capably handled,
has paid Its obligations promptly and
stands well with the general public
who look upon it with a sort of com
munity Interest.

COMPLAINTS ABOUT
THE C- 5 0. SCHEDULE.
THE DISSATISFACTION OVER THE
BIG SANDY CHANGE
CONTINUES.
The following from the Ashland In
dependent is a fair expression of the
following about the Big Sandy sch
edule:
The people of the Big Sandy Valley
are practically a unit in their opposi
tion to the new schedule on the Big
Sandy division of the C. A O. They
claim that they cannot see a single fea
ture in it that will either aid the C. A
O. system or the people who look to It
for service.
The Independent received a letter to
day from one of the foremost attorneys
residing In the Big Sandy territory in
regard to a business proposition and
be concluded his letter as follows: .
'Say, can't you do something or say
something that will aid in having this
abomination train schedule on the C
A O. changed ? All our people are rais
ing a cry against it as it does not ac
commodate anyone as it is now arrang
ed. We look upon the Independent as
x friend and a champion of every move
ment for the best interests of the Big
Sandy people. And for this reason we
expect you to do all in your power to
aid in having this abominable schedule
hanged."
This is a sample of the protests we
.ire getting every, day. If the managers
f the C. A O. really knew the feeling
there Is against this schedule, they
would surely try to remedy it right
away.
