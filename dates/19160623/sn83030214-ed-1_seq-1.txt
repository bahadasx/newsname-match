500 U. S. CA VALR Y RUSHED
TO RESCUE CARRIZAL SQUAD
U. S. TO BLAME, CARRANZA TELLS PAN-AMERICA
M n*.-ta
Washington, June 22.?The Latin-American governments have
been notified by General Carranza, it was learned here to-night, that
aa strict orders have been given his troops not to attack General
Pershing's men the responsibility for war, if it comes, will lie ex?
clusively with the United States.
Any new American expedition into Mexico, General Carranza
aaid, would be regarrled as an act of war in itself and would be
repulsed.
WAR WOULD BE FOR DEFENCE, SAYS U. S. NOTE
Washington, June 22.?Secretary Lansing to-day sent a memo?
randum to the diplomatic rcprcsentativ.s of South and Central
American nations announcing that in the event of war with Mexico
the purpose of the United States would be to defend itself against
further invasion and not intervene in Mexiean affairs. The memo?
randum. dated June 21, follows:
"I inclose for your information a copy of this government's
note of June 20 to the Secretary of Foreign Relations of the de
facto government of Mexico on the subject of the presence of
American tronps in Mexiean territory. This communication states
clearly the critical relations existing between this government and
the de facto government of Mexico and the causes which have Ied
up to vhc present situation.
"Should this situation eventuate into hostilities, which this gov?
ernment would deeply regret and will use every honorable effort to
avoid, I take this opportunity to inform you that this government
had for its object not intervention in Mexiean affairs. with all the re
grettable consequences which might result from such a policy, but
the defence of American territory from further invasion by bands of
armed Mexicans, protection of American citizens and property along
the boundary from outrages committed by such bandits, and the
prevention of future depredations by force of arms against the
?narauder* infesting this region and against a government which ia
encouraging and aiding them in their activities.
"Hostilities. in short. would be simply a state of international
war without purpose on the n-irt of the United States other than to
end the conditiona which menace our national peace and the safery
of our citizens."

Two American Officers Among thc Twelve
Slain?Mormon Scout Tells Story
of the Battle.
San Antonio. Tex., June 22.--Straggler*- from the 10th Cav?
alry detachment that WM in the fight at Carrizal arrived a
(ieneral Pershing's headquarters to-day and told him that th
fighting began with an unprovoked attack on the Americans
the conclihsion of a parley with the Mexiean commander. (ien?
eral Pershing transmitted their story to General Funston to?
night, who immediately referred it to the War Department.
The men were unable to tell anything regarding thi casual?
ties or even the later phases of the engagement. Thry rc
treated during the fight. became separated from their com?
mands. making their way back to the American Ita
Two troops of the 10th Cavalry Company, commanded bv
the capUin, Charles T. Boyd, and K Cavalry. commanded bj
Captain Lewis Morey, comprised the detachment that arrived
within a mile of Carrizal, at 7 a. m., on June 21. They had
stopped at Ojo de Santo Domingo on the previous night, resum
ing their march toward the east at 4 o'clock the next morning.
From their position in front of Carrizal. the commander of
the detachment, believed by (ieneral Pershing to have been .Cap.
?ain Royd, since he was senior in rank to Captain Morev. oidffed
that. a Mexiean guide be sent forward to secure from the com?
mander of the Mexiean garrison there permission to pass
through the town.
General Felix Gomez sent back word by the guide that the
Americans might pa.ss through if they would eonsent to a par
|?jy. Without awaiting for the commander of the Ameriean
force to reply. General Gomez, accompanied by an aid, appeared.
and the .American officer rode forward to talk with him.
FEARED THEY WOULD BE SURROUNDED.
While they were talking, the men iaid, the Mexiean troops
moved forward and deployed in such manner that then ap?
peared danger of the American force being surrounded. Om
of the men who had been holding the horse of the Ameriean
officer and the man who had ridden forward with him said the
American officer appeared to protest against the position.'* -"ien
eral (iomez's troops were taking. A few minutes later (ieneral
Gomez rode off toward one end of the Mexiean line and imme?
diately after getting there the .Mexicans began to attack, swecp
ing the .\meriean line with a maehine gun.
It was not until then, according to stragglers, that thc
Ameriean commanders gave orders for both troops lo dismount
and return the fire.
(ieneral Pershing said that before the Americans let't on tho
(xpedition both he and Major Evans. of the 10th Cavalry, eau
tioned the commanding officer to be careful not to DTOVoke ?
fight.
RELIEF SQUADRONS NOT HEARD FROM.
General Pershing had received no news of the two Mju&dron*
of the llth Cavalry he sent out this morning to gc-t in touch
with the troops that were at Carrizal. Staff officers here calcu
lated that the relief party should reach the remnant of the
detachment late to-night or to-morrow morning. lt was a**
sumed that because the two troops were returning with their
wounded. progress necessarily was slow. and that tht relief
party would have to travel almost the entire distanee tn m the
main line of communication to Carrizal. some eighty miles.
(ieneral Funston appeared impressed with thc sincerity
of the story brought in by the stragglers. but said that it would
DOt cause him to send any new instructions to (ieneral Pershing
or to any of the border commanders. The report will be in
Washington before morning.
General Pershing assured (ieneral Funston that bc would
forward to him as rapidly as possible any additional details he
seeured, and until he is in possession of all the facts and i*> eon
vinced of their accuracy (ieneral Funston said he will make no
move ealculated to eomplicate the situation.
