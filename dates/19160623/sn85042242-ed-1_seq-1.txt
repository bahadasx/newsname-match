Humphreys, a half-breed Mexican
employed as a watchman at the Naco
•water plant, was exonerated of crim­
inal blame late today by a coroner's
jury for killing early today one United
States soldier and wounding five oth­
ers, one seriously. Humphreys testi­
fied that he could not see the uni­
forms of the infantrymen and had be­
lieved them to be bandits.
The soldiers were fired upon by the
watchman as they approached the
water plant at 2 o'clock in the morn­
ing, preparatory to changing the
guards there. Before they could make
known their identity the following
casualties had resulted:
Walter E. Powell, private, was shot
through the chest and abdomen. He
lived one hour.

through the neck, right shoulder, right

Mexicans Take Negro Troopers
to Chihuahua
City
AMERICAN COMMANDER
WAS AMONG KILLED
Seventy-five in Detachment That
Clashed With Carranza
Fighters
Chihuahua City, Mexico, June 22.—
The seventeen American soldiers,
negro troopers, of the Tenth cavalry,
who were captured in the battle at
Carrizal, were brought here today
with Lem H. Spillsbury, a Mormon
scout employed by General J. J.
Pershing, and were interned.
Spillsbury said that Captain Charles
T. Boyd commanded the Americans,
and, with Lieutenant Henry R. Adair,
was among the killed.
Captain Moore, who was with the
American detachment, was wounded,
tout escaped.
In anno jijcing this aVlerno&ri a s^ofy
of the battle, which he said Spillsbury
had told him, General Jacinto Trevino,
commander of the military district of
the northwest, announced that any
time and at any place the American
troops move other than the border, he
will comply to the letter with his su­
perior's orders and will attack them
as General Felix Gomez did at Car­
rizal.
Seventy-six in Detachment.
General Trevino said that all diplo­
matic arrangements are outside his
sphere.
Spillsbury's story as announced by
General Trevino was to the effect that
76 negroes comprising troop o|
the Tenth cavalry, with Captains
Boyd and Morree, Lieutenant Adair
and himself, composed the American
detachment that encountered the Mex­
icans.
He said that he saw on the field
the dead bodies of Boyd and Adair
and at least, seven of the negroes.
"After we had waited some time
Lieutenant Colonel Rivas came out
and warned Captain Boyd that he had
better turn back. Captain Boyd then
explained that he was in pursuit of
some bandits, which he had heard
had looted Santo Domingo,, and also
was bound to capture a negro de­
serter, who he had heard was in. Villa
Ahumada.
Only Over Dead Bodies.
"Iii reply to this Lieutenant Rivas
notified the Americans that if he at­
tempted to advance he would have to
•pass over the dead bodies of the Mex­
icans. He advised Boyd that he had
better not argue the matter.
"Rivas returned to the village to
report to his superior officer, General
Gomez, who sent out a note inviting
the Americans to enter Carrizal for a
conference. Captain Boyd declined
this invitation.
"On this ground, Gomefc went out
in person and insistently urged the
Americans to retire, pointing out that
his orders from his superiors neces­
sitated his acting on them without fur­
ther parley. General Gomez repeated
the words as he walked away. Boyd
merely answered, 'All right.'"
General Trevino's announcement
then goes on to quote Spillsbury as
saying that after General Gomez had
retired to his troops, who were lined
up outside the town, Boyd ordered his
men to advance, whereupon Spills­
bury argued with him, saying the fight
would follow. Spillsbury is quoted as
saying, "Captain Boyd obstinately
seemed to think that the Mexican
general was only bluffing," and the
firing quickly began. He is quoted
further:
Men Left Behind.

London, June 22—The Germans and
Austrians in Volhynia are vigorously
on the offensive against the Russians
and seemingly have stopped, for the
time being, the Russian drive west­
ward. Along the Stokhod river, west
of the Styr, in the region of Sokul,
and still farther west around Mylsk,
sanguinary engagements are in prog:
ress. The Russian far office says the
Germans and Austrians have been re­
pulsed, while Berlin declares that on
both sides of the Turari river and
southward from Sviniaukhi to Groc
how, the Russians hav§ been driven
farther back, and that northwest of
Lutsk the Russian attempt to dispute
German successes were without re­
sult.
Russians Take More Trenches.
On the Strippa, in Galicia, the Rus­
sians have taken portions of the
trenches of the Teutonic allies near
Gaivoronka, and farther south, in
Bukowina, have driven their forces
farther southward and captured- Ra
dautz, about thirty miles below Czer
nowitch, and taken more officers,, men
and guns.
North of the Pripet marshes to the
,region..Qt ana. hay

what apparently 'Itf.ri general offensive,
heavily bombarding Russian positions.
On both sides of the Meuse, in the
region of Verdun, and east of the
fortress in the Woevre at the foot of
the Meuse hills, Germans are heavily
bombarding the French. Particularly
heavy are the attacks against hill 304
and Lemorr Homme, and northeast of
the Thiaumont, and Vaux Wood, and
Hapitre, and Fort Laufeet. In a coun­
ter attack the French have retaken
from the Germans most of the trench­
es captured Wednesday night between
Funin Wood and Henois, northeast of
Verdun.
Germans, near Givenchy, captured
British trenches, but later were driven
out, suffering heavy losses.

Stay of execution was granted pend­

Bragdon will remain at liberty un­
der the $35,000 bonds now in effect,
provided the county attorney's office
decides the form of the bond valid.
Judge Fish had denied Bragdon the
sentence from three months to one
year in the county Jail. Unless pa­
roled or pardoned he must serve the
full term of seven years, less the time
allotted for good behavior, the maxi­
mum of which would be about two
years. Bragdon showed strains of
the sentence only once, when he heard
the- word "prison.""

Washington, June 22.—Orders
went from the war department
tonight to General Beary at Chi­
cago, commanding the central de­
partment, and General Bell at San

Since his overthrow of Villa and Zapata, Carranza has been recognized
as the official li^ad of the Mexican, government by the United States, but
his power has long been reported tottering, and many see in his recent
defiance of Washington an attempt to recoup his fortunes by an appeal to
Mexico's underlying dislike of the "gringoes."
Elaborate Preparations by
Towns and Cities to Give
Militia Rousing Departure
Most of the towns and cities of
No^h Dakota arc centering their at­
tention on giving the militia boys a

R. D. Hoskinst, clerk of the supreme
court, h^s suggested the raising of
one for Co. A. He declares that he is
ready to start it.
No preparations have yet been
made in Bismarck for giving its com­
pany a fitting send-off when it leaves
for encampment, but several plans
have been suggested and are being
considered. The business men are
backing the organization in splenfiid
style and the boys appreciate the loy­
al support. Each day finds more win­
dows with the Stars and Stripes and

Recruiting continued yesterday.
Capt. Welch sent a sergeant and an
auto to Hazelton, Napoleon, McKen

age enlistment. Seven men have been
disqualified to date, for various physi­
cal deficiencies.
Mandan has made arrangements to
give the boys of Co. a rousing send
off when they leave for Bismarck.
The band will be out, whistles will
blow and the people will gather at the
depot.
Co. is not yet recruited to the
minimum strength of 58 men, but con­
siderable enthusiasm has been shown
and many have signified their inten­

Washington, ,hm 22—One, fact leaktul out, lonight, at the
close of a day ol many (level.o[mi(nts in the Mexican (irisis. Ap­
parently both tlue United Spates government, and the de facto
authorities oil Mexico hoped to treat the clash at Carrizal yester­
day as an incident aggravating gravely strained relations,- but
not likely to preciptLte general hostilities. So far as the Wash­
ington administration is concerned, no final decision can be
reached until President. Wilson has received a report, from the
American army officers. 'All information so far has come from
Mexican source.
Try to Get Word
'General Pershing is inaking every effort, to get word from the
captain of the 10th eavjalry, believed to have been engage^:
Carrizal.
