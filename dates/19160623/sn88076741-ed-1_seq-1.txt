THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
And now .grini war which has been
shadowing this country incidentally
from across the sea, is actually threaten
ing us with the real thing. The khaki
uniform has suddenly been donned by
thousands of young men who will soon
be hastening to the Mexican border.
The telegraph columns this week have
been headed. "It is now up to Car
ranea." That is a mistake. Carranza
"watchfully waiting" while he gets more
troops togethec, but conditions in Mexi
co will not, cannot change until the
United States intervenes with force. It
is a condition which we face and have
been lacing for more than a year. The
fact Carranza is not a fact just a theory.
Mexico has no government and has no
pro6peet of government until the United
States takes charge,
The "war"
.part will not last very long.
Carranza has no money, but few arms,
no artillery and bis troops will be com
posed of bandits and persons who will
go into the army to keep from starving.
With all Mexican ports blockaded and a
cordon along the boundary as a fighting
proposition Mexico will not amount to
much.
Nevertheless we have a big job ahead
of us. It will be a case of the Indians
and the Philippines over again. It is a
big country and there are about fifteen
million people mostly very poor and vt ry
ignorant.
This means that we will probably have
to keep perhaps twenty-five thousand
troops in Mexico for .at least several
years, perhaps even until a second gen
eration of Mexicans are born and edu
cated in the common schools that we
ehall establish there
In the earlier fighting there will ne
cessarily be 8me loss of life, but we
look for no battles on any such scale as
those now in progress in Europe.
The war in Europe has been a con
tinuance of the former week. Still the
Germans pound away at Verdun, with
dead wounded as the only tangible re
sults.
The Russians still oontinue-their vic-
torious drive through Galieia to the Wilson, called out the militia of ill the
treat, states to assemble on the Mexioan bor
The non-activity of the submarines ia dor so that the regular troops night be
mtj notioable, bat the air mea are {better able to "intervene".

THAT FAR-tOFF BOGY.
This week's "Non partisan Leader*'1
has imoditied the politics of that party
to a very considerable extent. At tbe
beginning the doctrine was "Nobody
but tfarmers on guard." It was claimed
that the legislature was composed of
lawyers, doctors and business men who
were the enemies of farmers and tbat
the only .way the farmers could prevent
themselves from being robbed of millions
of dollars .was to elect only farmers to
the legislature.
The Leader" has however awakened'
up to the fact that when the farmer
thinks about it, he knows that the busi
ness tuen of his local city and town withj
whom he has done business and beea
4th—\V Watts Leroy friends for.
many years are not his sworn
(5th—Jos Morrison Drayton enemies,.and are not paid agents who
are trying to rob him of millions of dol
lars.
So the ".Leader" has now constructed
a great big bogy tbat don't live in North
Dakota, was never seen in North Dakota
but which is.called "Big .Business" and
lives. somewhere down east—and tbat is
the animal that the Non-partisan party
are after.
But this Animal has very many hired
servants in North Dakota who are busy
bringing in the millions of farmers' dol
lars to feed this monster, and it is pre
sumed that all the members of the last
legislature that voted, say against the
terminal elevator, were among .these
paid agents, that practically all of the
majorities of all North Dakota legisla
tures were also of this class of second
hand thieves, and as these have always
been elected by majorities of the voting
population—it follows that notwith
standing that far-oif Big Business
Bogy" that the great majority of the
people of North Dakota are and have
beea busy all these years in robbing
themselves and each other for the bene
fit of this Big Bogy.
It is no use Mr. Leader, either we are
all in it or we aiat. You drew the lines
yourself. It is farmers as one against
the rest of the people of North Dakota.
You made that the "close-communion"
shibboleth. You organizad in secret
with that as the password. It was class
against class and your only argument
was the business men of North Dakota
were banded together to rob the farmers
of millions of money—and forsooth not
to put in their own pockets but to hand
over to that Big Bogy.
Even the Leader has at last discover
ed that farmers have some sense—and
has how tried to remove the Bogy far
enough away that the farmers cannot
investigate before next Wednesday
The Bogy thrt had lived next door for
so many years did frighten the farmers
enough.
The Republican county committee met
at Cavalier Monday and outlined plans
for the coming campaign, and appointed
J. R. Gibson of St. Thomas chairman of
the county committee to fill the place of
Dr. James who is in Boston under medi
cal care and will not be be back in time
to attend to matters with the best of re
sults from his properation. The whole
committee was present save two.
A week ago, presumably to save the
face" of President Wilson and on his be
half, the Democratic convention at St.

affaire of Mexico. On Monday the Secre

MEXICO.
As we write early in the week we have
news that the militia of the several states
will be called to the border to allow the
regular army to move into Mexico.
It lookB like the culmination of events
that have been transpiring in that un
happy country for several years and
which have increased in •intensity dur
•ing the last few months.
Nobody wants to intervene in Mexico
If Mexico were only on the other side of
the world or across the sea we would
have no special occasion to interfere,
otkly to pity.
•But the ruotions in Mexioo have not
•nly interfred with property rights and
privileges as well as life and liberty
there but these outrages have now in
several instances occurred on the soil of
•the United States.
?", '$,-«.*

Twice we have "invaded" Mexico with
armed men. Ouce we jetired because—
well, the Mexicans think it was because,
we were afraid to stay, and now they de*
mand that we again evacuate, though in.
the very meatime border raids are going
on and would be far more frequent if it
were not for the military forces on guard
at the line. Such a state of affairs is of
course intoletable.
There is only one way to deal with
Mexican. .He stands on.an entirely dif
ferent ground .from an .American. An
argument does not qppeal to him, and'
it is doubtful if he understands it.
There is nothing more true than that
nobody in this country wants Mexico,
politically, territorially or even socially
Yet few Mexicans believe this to be true
and they think we want to gobble that
country up, for our own aggrandizment.
You can't treat a .Mexican as you
would another white man. Anything
less than brute force he deams weakness
and cowardice.
.President Wilson ought to have learn
•ed this by this time. Any way, according
to the dispatches, the .Mexicans are
making him understand it after his
months of "watchful waiting."
It is a nasty mess, but it is up .to us to
.clean i^p in front of our own doors
and the world at large expects us to do
•it. Let us make a good job of it, though
it .m'ay cost men and monejr.
BEFORE AND AFTEJR
Politically, the local partisan news
paper is muzzled by the result* of the
primary election law—that remarkable
law that was placed upon the statute
books by the almost unanimous vote of
the people and for which everybody has
the profoundest disgust.
Naturally, this paper and others, have
a choice among the various candidates
whose names will appear on the ballots
that will be placed in the hands of the
voters next Wednesday, June 28th. As
individuals the editors may express their
choice by secret ballot or perhapp by
word of mouth, but the paper cannot
consistently support one candidate
against another when it is possible that
it will later become its partisan duty to
support the other. Anyway, such sec
ond hand support would not be very ef
fective on the voters nor yet very highly
appreciated by the candidate.
Hence in this preliminary vote the
Pioneer Express has not cared to mix in
to any extent among the opposing can
didates of the republican party. It has
also felt that it has no particular objec
tion to any of the candidates, though it
has it9 own preferences. We prefer
therefore to let the voters choose their
candidates themselves and after they
are thus chosen we shall do what we can
to elect them.
VOTE, VOTE, VOTE
We want to call the attention of the
voters next week at the primary to this
fact. The Non-partisan party, (which i3
a party,)evidently intends to disrupt the
republican party. They have nominat
ed their candidates almost entirely
among the republicans.
Politically this is a shrewd move. The
democratic p«uty is in the minority in
the state and county. It is a foregone
conclusion if the republicans unite on
the ticket selected next Wednesday that
they will be successful. It is also a fore
gone conclusion that in cases' of which
tbere as several candidates are running
for the same office, that the non-partisan
candidate stands the best show if the
vote is small and scattered as it seems
likely to be. The non-partisans are new
and full.of enthusiasm, they will mostly
be on band and united. The others are
not so particularly interested and will
have a scattered vote. This is parti
cularly truejof the governorship, Every
body should try and get out and vote
for somebody next Wednesday.
A week ago the democratio party in
oonvention assembled put a "non-inter
vention plank" into their plat
form. Ooinoidentally, Mr. De Faoto

VOLUME XXXVIII.
With this issue the Pioneer Express
•liters upon its thirty eighth year of
existence and under the present man
agement twenty nine years. In looking
over the past we can see many changes
to the newspaper field. Practically all
the .old publications have ohanged hands
several times during this period, and
many of the publishers sie gone, some
retired from the business and more of
thetti gone to the great beyond. In this
coujaty we have seen young men enter
thev field who are past youths now.
New publication have started which
nattmlly limits the field of a country
weeMy, but the Pioneer Express has
continued on, hewing to the line, politi
cally. and otherwise as beet we see it, and
are pleased to say that me have sub
acritiers our list who have been with us
since before we took charge. To these,
as well as the rest of our friends, we ex
tend a hearty good wishes and hope for a
continuance of past pleasent relations.
NO WAR-NO GLORY.
There will be no war with Mexico.
There is no Mexico Tbere can be nc
nation without a government. There
oan be no war with a peice of land, nor
yet with a scattered unruled populace.
There will be no glory even in a mili
tary sence in fighting in Mexico. We'
learned many years ago that tbere are:
several kinds of people with whom there
was no glory to be gained in a tight,
•umoog whom were an old man, a woman
or a child. We would be ashamed not
ito whip them, while we would be still
More ashamed to allow them to whip us
