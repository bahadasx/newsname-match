In a week's time only fit men
have been recruited in 'his city.
This is considered nothing
short of a disgrace, acno.'ding to
Gen. Thompson's aide, Lieut. \V.
W. Smith, of Seattle, who arriv
ed in Tacoma today to recruit,
men for all branches of 'he guard
Lieut. Smith is going lo start
a campaign which will be similar
to Kitchener's in England. He
says he will have 50 men by to
morrow night or know the rea-
son why.
New recruiting quarters have
been located at 1205 Pacific aye.
This place will be covered with
signs urging the young men not
to let "Seattle beat Taootna."
"Enlist today, tomorrow may
be too late," and similar appeal*
will be tacked on automobiles
and hauled through the Tacoma
streets, according to Lieut. Smith.
"We will have a band on the
job all of the time.
"I intend to speak In ail of the
theaters and If the men don't
come on their own accord, we'll
draft them," says he.
"People dont' realize the
seriousness of the situation,
Their government needs
them.
"Patriotism! Why, they
don't know what |>atriotlsni
means. I_ook at Seattle.
More than :M>,ooo |iersons
marched in a preparedness
parade. Yet only 150 men
were recruited in that city.
"Look at this Business Men's
Preparedness league and the Le
gion of Honor. How many of
them have enlisted?"
Lieut. Cronander, of troop B,
Is still hunting for more men for
the troop. He will remain at tho
recruiting station. F*ir3t Lieut.
Cramer after spending his first
night In camp, came back to Ta
coma to complete the disposition
Of contracts, with the Kreatest
praise for the troopers.
"It was wonderful," he sail,
"the manner In which the men
dug intp work and made camp.
Today the troop will be dlyided

MILITIA
MAY BE
IN LINE
If tbe order to move to the
border doesn't come before July
4, not only Troop B, but all
state troops encamped at Ameri
can lake, will turn out to march
down the city streets in Tacoma's
great big preparedness parade.
It will be one of the biggest
military demonstrations ever
seen in Tacoma. By tlie time
the Fourth rolls around at least
2,000 militanien will have ar
rived at Cosgrove.
These will be the men who will
lead Tacoinans in their demon
stration for preparedness and
coast defense.
Sure, there is a big "if"
attached to all of this. The
border antl the bandits may
get first call on our guards
men.
They may lie ordered to
move south any day.
If not, the committee in charge
of the parade has been assured
j that they will march.
The parade will be so big that
I the committee was compelled to
day to cut out the feature of ex
ercises at the Stadium for a
wind-up. They figured that by
the time the rear end marchers
would reach the Stadium, every
body else would have completed
the exercise and would be ready
to go home. Also, that if the
exercises were held up to wait
for the last of the paradero It
would mean to long a delay.
"Not less than lo.iiiiii in
line" no longer is the slo
gan. More than lo.ootl
marchers are certain al
ready, the committee says,
and many more are ex|><*ctcd
to fall in line.
The line of march will be from
the city hall, down Pacific aye. to
15th st.. thence up Hroadway to
9th, where the parade will dis
band.
The reviewing stand will be on
Broadway, between 9th and llth.
There Gov. I.tster and staff,
Mayor Kawcett and othe- «ffi
cials will review the marchers.
The civic, fraternal and patri
otic organizations each tvn, tie
assigned to sb eparate division
In the parade. The lineup will be
announced next week.

B SURE OF IT !
Mabel Abbott Finds Army
Camp This Time Differs
From the Usual American
Lake Encampment.
BY MABEL ABBOTT
It is hard to realize that the cheerful camp at American
lake, which Troop I! is rapidly getting shaken down into,
Miss Abbott.. There was a pleasant smell of warm earth,
new lumber antl fir trees.
Officers Proud of the Sanitation,
But It's "Going" That the Men Talk About
Save for tlie fart that there are more men in the troop and
more tents this year, it might he just the usual summer en
eani|iment. The laughter is a little more frequent anil in a
little higher key, |ierha|>s; antl some of the men have brown
goggles tietl VMM their hats, "to protect our eyes when we
get to the iHU'tler' hut these are small things.
The officers point with pride to the sanitation of the
ramp; to the pipes that hring safe drinking water from a deep
well; antl to the commissary arrangements.
BUT THE MEN TALK MORE OF THE CHANCE OP
GOING."
"I wish I was as sure of a million dollars as I am of go
ing," announced Private Llewellyn, ehallenglngly.
There are a good many seasoned men in the camp. Pri
vate Llewellyn is unmistakably one of them.
He stands with the slouch of the man who belongs on a
horse; and he views the process of making a comfortable camp
with the philosophic detachment of a man who fete camped in
many and hard places.
Former Sergeant Returning South
As Private Rather Than Stay Away
He was in the Third cavalry, regular army, for six years;
on the border three years; he was in a five-hour fight at
llachita; he was one of the guard that brought 40,000 Mexican
refugees to American soil; and he was in the relief party that
drove the Villistas out of Columbus after the raid. He held
the rank of servant, and was on Col. Scott's staff for a time.
His home was In San Antonio.
Only a short time ago he came north —and now he is
going back as a private, rnther than stay away.
"Yes, 1 know the border pretty well, all the way from
Douglas, Ariz., to Brownsville, Tex.," he admitted, "it's a hot
old country.
—"Yes, I've seen a lot of Mexicans. Saw some of them
when we chased them out of Columbus.
—"Well, the man thing 1 noticed about them was that
they were about the dirtiest bunch of people 1 ever saw.
It's the Excitement That Calls,
and at That It's Not Always Exciting
—"Oh, yes'm, 1 was scared to death the first time I was
under fire.
—"Why I want, to go back? Oh, I don't know,—l guess
It's the excitement. And there Isn't so much excitement about
it, either. For a good while down there I never saw a soul
hut the 12 men I was with. We lived mostly on bacon nnd
hardtack, and we couldn't even swim for fear some Mexican
would take a shot at us.
"We pulled the body of one fellow out as he came floating
down the river. He was cut up—l can't tell you, but he was
cut horribly.
— "Oh, well, I couldn't stay away if there's going to be
something doing."
Then there is Private Wolff. He was never in the army;
but he was living in Mexico City when Diaz was deposed, and
when shells fell in the streets of the city while Madero held
Chapultepec.
Figure They'll Be Hauling Rocks
and Hauling Rocks and Hauling Rocks, But—
He got out of .the country at last, unhurt but leaving ev
erything he possessed behind. He Isn't going to miss a chance
of getting back at the Mexicans.
"Sure we're going," he said. "I can't figure it out any
other way."
They are all sure they are going. That is the principal dif
ference between this camp and the camps that American Lake
has seen before.
As I came away, a couple of sweating youngsters were
dragging a gunny-sack full of rocks up to floor the improvised
garbage incinerator. They stopped to take breath.
"An' 1 suppose," panted one, trying bard to sound as if h«
were not complaining Instead of rejoicing, "we'll be liauUn'
rocks for the next camp; an' then we'll be haulm' rocks a%*
the next camp after that; an' then we'll he haulm' rooks—V-vTv
They bent to their task again, their faces shining. FOR
THEY ARE SURE THEY ARE GOING.

Mexico's Strong Man
Student and Inventor
JUARKZ, Mexico, June If. —
Gen. Alvaro Obregon, Mexico's
greatest military leader, presents
an otltl case because at heart he
is not a soldier at all.
His constant dream is of peace
and tranquility but he is a fight
ing demon, both as soldier and
diplomat, when there is lighting
to be done.
More than once he has ex
pressed his disgust for warfare,
which he terms a devil's game in
which humans should not indulge
but he fought through the Mexi
can revolution, always In the
thick of the action, and today is
niinns his risht arm— from the
elbow down—as the result of a
battle al Leon.
. Farmer, student, inventor, he
is of the uncertain and not very
well defined middle class of
Mexico. His parents were not
peons nor Immense landowners.
For generations the Obregons
have been small planters, occa
sionally sending a son to the
I'^itetl States to be educated.
(Sen. Obregon wits born In
Siuiora :tfi years ago. A slight
strain of Yaqui blood gives him
a high cheek bone.
The predominating Spanish
Hood, however, accounts for his
complexion more white than that
of his fellows. He is six feet
tall, weighs 180 pounds, is mili

TWO TROOPS
ANNIHILATED
Late Reports Show Battle
of Carrizal More Deadly
Than Thought at First;
Another Raid Reported.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 23.—The out
standing developments in the Mexican crisis to
day were these:
The national guard of all the states was or
dered to make every possible speed toward a
movement to the border.
News that continued to trickle in from Mexico
indicated that two whole U. S. troops, instead of
a mere 12 men, had been annihilated in the Car
rizal fighting.
From Columbus, N. M., came word of another
raid of American territory by Mexican bandits.
Chicago echoed the war scare with word that
wheat had dropped, for the first time in many
months, to below the dolla • mark.
Mining companies near El Paso, Tex., it was, re
ported that troops C and X of the Tenth Cavalry
were practically annihilated in a Carranzista trap at
Carrizal.
The little handfull of American soldiers made a,
gallant stand. They were greatly outnumbered and
forced back. Mexican cavalry pursued them and
shot them down, when many of their horses stam
peded.
A few who escaped are reported w«andering in the
foothills without food and water. Gen. Pershing
J sent a strong detachment to rescue the scattered
fragments of the force.
The relief column is reported near Carrizal, but
Mexican official reports deny this. The fact that
none of the stragglers have returned to the Ameri
can base lent strength to the mining companies' re
ports.
Pershing's official account of the Cerrizal fight
will be sent direct to Washington to await the ad
ministration's orders as to further steps.
Mexican bandits are reported to have invaded the
United States 50 miles west of Columbus. It is re
ported they are running the horses from Parker'3
ranch.
Wheat was below the dollar mark at Chicago for
the first time since the 1914 boom. July wheat
closed at nearly three points belo wthe opening price.
Bear raids based on good weather reports caused the
slump.
