that the German representatives

Some Americans have taken advan

subjects by placing their property in
the hands of German friends upon
leaving Mexico.
This information was disclosed
by a competent authority in connecton
with information concerning the
activity in Mexican affairs of Capt.
Franz von Rintelen, now under indictment
in New York for conspiracy
to foment strikes in American
munitions planes, and under arrest
in England.

not agains the United States.
The information obtained leads o-i
ficials to believe that by starting a
dispute between the United States
and Meixco. munition shipments
from America would bo stopped, that
the United States would be too busy
to pursue the submarine controversy
and that the allied navies would be

It was pointed out today that at no

failed to press its demands in regard
to the conduct of submarine warfare

Mexico. As for the exportation of
