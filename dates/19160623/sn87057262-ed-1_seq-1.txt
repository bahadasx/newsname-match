EL PASO, Texas, June 23.—
Unconfirmed reports received
today by American mining
companies, stated that troops
and K, of the Tenth United
States cavalry were practically
annihilated in the fighting at
Cattisal wfceiiled into the ttar-i
ranzista trap.
The little handful of Ameri
can soldiers made a gallant
stand, but greatly outnum
bered, were forced back. The
Mexican cavalry pursuing,
shot down United States cav
alrymen whose mounts had
stampeded after the troopers
dismounted to fight, declared
the private advices.
The few who escaped are re
ported to be wandering in the
foothills without food or wa
ter. It was said that General
Pershing had sent a strong col
umn to rescue the scattered
fragments of the force nearly
slaughtered at Carrizal. The
relief column was reported rac
ing along the dry bed of the
Rio Carmen toward Carrizal.
These advices are contra
dicted by official Mexican re
ports.^
Watchful Waiting Again.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, June 23.—A report
from General Pershing containing the
etory of the Carrizal fight between
Americans and Carranzistas, based
solely on Information of returning
Tenth cavalrymen, was In the war
department's hands today. Its con
tents were characterized as confirm

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 23.—Uncle
team*8 quartermaster department at
St. Louis today was one of the busiest
spots in the service. Practically all
the supplies for the state guardsmen
and regulars mobilized in the south
west are being supplied from the St.

Early today many large storage

tirely upon it as proving that the at
tack was unprovoked with the Mex
icans entirely the aggressors.
Watchful waiting was invoked
anew by the administration today In
the Mexican problem. Help in fram
ing this government's course—pre
sumably diplomatic, but poastMy
stronger—was anticipated in a pre
liminary report of General Pershing

to contain the story of Tenth cavalry
stragglers, putting responsibility for
the affair upon the Mexicans.
The full official versiop, based on
officers' reports, was expected from
Pershing during the day.
Meantime war department activity
centered in getting militia troops
ready for bocder service. Ten thous
and men, gathered from the central
and western departments, will leave
as soon as they can be prepared.
(Probably this will be in a very f§w
days. The administration position
up to early today tended to class the
Cafrizal incident with the now for
gotten Parral clash and the more re
cent unprovoked attack upon Amer
ican Bailors at Mazatlan.
One source of real trouble in the
Carrizal affair, apparently remain
ing, is the fact that American pris
oners are still held in Mexican ens
tody.
As for Carranza himself, adminis
tration men have reason to believe
he is trying to get his men in line
and avoid hostilities.
On the other hand, the attitude of
his generals is manifestly unpleas
ant. General Trevino's reported ap
proval of the Carrizal clash and his
announcement that he would take
similar action in the same circum
stances, was regarded here as indica
tive of a threatening trend of events
perhaps beyond Carranza's control.
Hundreds of Refugees.
VERA CRUZ. June 23.-Arrival of
hundreds of American refugees here
today, fleeing before war clouds, fail
ed to bring any unusual excitement *o
Mexico's principal seaport. The na
tive- residents are optimistic. The
refugees unite in declaring the crowds
which greeted them at railroad sta
tions on their trip here were fairly
courteous.

ship Nebraska was lying peacefully at
anchor, with close to two hundred
American citizens aboard. The Ne

for the arrival of a transport which
will relieve them of the civilians
aboard. A transport for the refugees
is expected within twenty-four or
forty-eight hours.
A train from Mexico City late last
night brought several score,Ameri
cans and several hundred other
foreigners. Not one of tht i^e had any
thing but the highest praise for the
courtesy and polite treatment accord
ed them by constitutionalist troops
and officers in Mexico City and en
route. Twelve carloads of American
refugees under care of Special Agent
Rodger's were expected from the capi
tal some time today. The hotels, por
tals and cafes of Vera Cruz were alive
with Americans today. For the most
part they were in good spirits and
hopeful of an amicable adjustment of
the difficulties between the two gov
ernments.
All Aeropla'nes Broken.
EL PASO, Texas, June 23.—The
fate of Captain Lewis Morey's caval
ry detachment, which was in the Car
rizal fight, and the possibility that
the squadron of the Eleventh United
States cavalry sent to their relief has
also been engaged by the Carranzis
tas, caused the gravest anxiety in
official circles here today.
Nothing has been heard from Mo
rey's men since they were lured into
ambush Wednesday and out up by
has arranged to reinforce the relief
column if it is attacked by the vastly
superior number of Carranzistas in
the Carrizal district.
The absence of any aeroplanes
with the American expedition in Mex
ico was the basis of considerable crit
icism here today. Aviators in swift
tlying machines could have learneJ
the truth about the Carrizal situa
tion almost immediately. All aero
planes Intended for scouting with
Pershing are dismantled at the Co
lumbus base, undergoing repairs.
Juarez today was practically de
serted, the 4.7 inch guns on the Am
erican side still menacing the little
Mexican city. General Gonzales and
a comparative handful of men are
still believed to be in Juarez. Gener
al Bell at Fort Bliss, Is said to have
information that a considerable Car
n-nzista force is hidden in the hilis
around Juarez. The troops that evac
uated the city are reported to have
been concentratcd twenty miles south
or Juarez with other Carranzista
faices.'
In British Hands.
WASHINGTON, June 23. The
'United States government is under
stood to have made formal request of
Great Britain to take charge of Amer
ican Interests in Mexico should war
occur between the two countries.
State department officials refused
to confirm or deny the report today,
but it was indicated that preliminary
steps have been taken to safeguard
this country's Interests. It was ex-

"Germany's power is clearly wan
ing. The strength of the allies Is
increasing as Is provtH by the dully
events In the fighting at Verdun and
in the advance on the Russian front
as well, by successes of the class of
the Skagerak naval battle and of the
victories in Asia "Minor.
"The war can end but one way.
That is when allied soli is «wept clean

one way means the mailed fist and
the will of the strongest the other
means the right to enjoy individual
culture. Prussia has set out to im

the allies should defend the other.
We are faithful to the trust. We are
mutually pledged to do that. We
were never eo united as now and
never so strong. We wish peace as
ardently as any one, but it mu.st Uc
the right sort. PBaio must be per

militarism must go. After all, it is
this militarism we are combating

As a result of the spy scare more
vigorous precautions than ever were
put into effect in the base camp
here. The arsenal containing mil

the object of the principal protective

Rules governing the military reserva

Hope for a Settlement.
MEXICO CITY, June 22.—Salvador
and Costa Rico have notified the
Mexican government that they will
Join Mexico in opposing invasion br
the United States, it was stated to
day.
Though armed conflict with the
United States is now considerd im
minent, the Mexican peop'e still hope
for a settlement of the controver3itv
by diplomatic negotiations.
Thursday was observed as a holi
day In" the capital, being the religious
festival of Corpus Cbristi. Business
was suspended generally. The streets
and parks were crowded. The people
talked nothing but the prospects of
war with the United States.
"I see no real obstacle In the way
of closest commercial relations be
tween Russia and America," he re
plied. "The idea has my hearty sup
port I quite share your able am
bassador's expressed views on the
subject. To like each, other better
we need only to get better acquaint
ed."
Discussing the Polish situation, the
foreign minister said that he greatly
appreciated American's generous
steps to feed the unfortunate people
of invaded Poland.
"The population there Is sadly
treated by the enemy," he added.
"They continue to remove all avail
able provisions, thus increasing the
hunger and suffering. Russia already
has showed her appreciation of en
deavors to relieve Poland by permit
ting food to enter the. country despite
the fact that Germany might take ad
vantage of the situation to divert
part of the supplies to her own use.
I regret deeply that Germany has re
fused to agree not to remove food
stuffs already In Poland, as this ren
ders It difficult to admit new Ameri
can supplies."
"Your excellent has just returned
from the front what Is your impres
sion?" he was asked.
"The spirit of the army is excel
lent," he replied. "Officers and men
are thoroughly confident of their suc
cess. I return Immensely pleased."

Mexico business men interviewed
by' the United Press expressed disbe
lief that the United States would risk
destroying her friendly relations with
Latin-American countries, after labor
ing so hard to establish '.hem. by con
flict with Mexico. They believe that
the American government realizes
that the invasion of Mexico would
arouse hostility against the United
States throughout Central and South
America, endangering, if not ruining,
trade connections of American mer
chants and manufacturers. In fact
all classes of people seem to believe
that some way will be found out of
the difficulty without a permanent
breach of friendly relations.
Proclamation issued by War Minis
ter Obregon, calling upon all who
have been in arms against the gov
ernment to abandon that altitude and
join the Carranza forces in case of
war with the United States, is ex
pected to bring general response.
Those who have been declared out
laws by Carranza are excluded from
the call. Those who do not accept
the call will be consldeied outlaws.
Obregon called attention to the fact
that opposition leaders in the states
of Coahuila, Chihuahua, Durango,
Zacatecas and elsewhere already have
recognized the constitutionalist gov
ernment, thus setting the example for
others.
Story of the Ambush.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 23.—
General Pershing has wired General
Funston that the Mexican garrison
has evacuated Casas Grandes. He
made no mention of having occupied
the city. Funston was Inclined to
doubt press reports that Pershing
had declared martial law in that city
and Nuevo Casas Grandes, saying h«
believed Pershing would have report
ed such action.
Want President Wilson to Tell
Why He Sends Militia
to the Front.
WASHINGTON, June 22.—With re
publicans, led by Repiesentativo
Mann, demanding explicit expression
from the president as to bis reasons
for sending the militia to the border
with power to order them into Mex
ico, Chairman Hay of the house mili
tary affairs committee this afternoon
began his fight to make the national
guard actually a federal fotce. Oppo
sition to the resolution because Presi
dent Wilson has not appeared before
congress in person to explain th-s
Mexican situation seemed to grow
rapidly. Representative Gardner of
Massachusetts asked that the whole
matter be postponed for consideration
until tomorrow. Hay pressed for im
mediate consideration.
Declaring the action would not con
stitute a declaration of war nor an
admission that a state of war exists.
Hay brought the matter up immedi
ately on the convening of the house.

The 'squadron of the Tenth caval
ry gent«by Pershing to investigate
the Carrizal battle, had not returned
early today, but Pershing forwarded
to Funston the report of the fight
brought into camp by stragglers who
participated.
The negro troopers stated that
while scouting, they joined Troops
and K, Tenth cavalry at OJo Santo
Domingo, Tuesday night Captain
Charles Boyd, commanding Troop C,
as senior captain, was In charge of
the expedition. At 4:30 Wednesday
morning the column started In the
direction of Carrizal, arriving within
a mile of the village at 7 a. m.
A Mexican guide was sent out to
ask the Carranza commandant if the
American troops might, pass through
the town. At first. General Felix
Gomez, commanding, refused, but lat
er sent word the Americans might
pass if they would stop In the town
for a parley.
Before Captain Boyd could start.
General Gomez rode out with two
aides and engaged the American offi
cers in conversation. While they
were talking, Mexican soldiers began
pouring out of the town in large
nttmbers. Captain Boyd saw the dan
ger of being surrounded and ordered
his command to fall back.
At this juncture, Gomez turned and
galloped to the right of his own lines.
He gave an order and the Mexicans
opened Are. Captain Boyd ordered
his men to dismount and return the
tire. Heavy fighting ensued. After
an interval of an hour or two, the
negroes holding the horses in the
rear of the line, mounted and spurred
hway. This was all the stragglers,

REPUBLICANS STIRRING UP
RUMPUS IN CONGRESS
placing on congress the responsibility
for drafting the militia. Hay asked
that the language of the draft em
powering the president to draft
militia be made to read:
"That in the opinion of congress
the United States, whereas an emer
gency now exists which demands the
use of troops in addition to the regu
lar army, the president is hereby
authorized to draft into the United
States army any or all the members
of the national guard."
Republican Leader Mann objected
to having placed on congress the re
sponsiiblity of declaring that an emer»
gency exists, unless President Wil
son should directly or indirectly as
sure the house that such is the case.
"I am authorized," replied Chair
man Hay. "to say that the president
believes an emergency is present and
it is absolutely necessary to command
the service of the militia."
Continuing, Mann said" "I do not
know whether the troops should be
kept in Mexico or not. It is evident
that the troops cannot remain in the
heart of the country without there
being a certain amount of friction
with the Mexicans. I cannot see why
they are being kept in Mexico when
they have not accomplished what
they set out to do."
