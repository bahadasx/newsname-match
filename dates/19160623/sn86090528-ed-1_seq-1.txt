With Mayor Coffman presiding and
all members except Cavett present,
the city council was in session about
an hour yesterday afternoon, adjourn
ing till the first Monday in July at
which time a meeting will be held for
the purpose of making up the city
budget for the coming year.
Immediately preceding the adjourn
ment Treasurer Clark appeared before
the council and stated that a repre
sentative of the Spitzer-Rorick bond
people hud seen him during the after
noon and made threats, in the name of
his company, against .the city, threat
cuing, among othe things, to file im
mediate suit against the city as a
whole and against each individual
member of the city council, unless the
city, through its proper officers,
should turn over to his company the
$I7,(H accrued penalty on the paving
tax bonds, said amount being now
!eld in trust, in the shape of a war
rant drawn for its payment, until such
time "as the courts shall finally adjudi
cate the matter. Mr. Clark stated that
he had told the representative of the
bond people that the matter would
probably go before the United States
supreme couu, wnereupon the icpre
sentativc had stated that unless the
sum collected and held in trust should
be turned over within CO days, his
people would call together all bond
holders and institute suit against the
city for the interest at the rate of (1
per cent until t.iturity, for 10 percent
after maturity, or from JO 10, and for
an additional 10 per cent from 1910
to the present time.
Councilman Hayes stated that it
would possibly be the concensus of
the opinion of the council to let them
sue; that the city was holding the
funds In trust; that when the suit
should be finally settled the proper
disposition of these interest collec
tions would be made.
Councilman Caneman stated that
he agreed with Councilman Hayes;
that a rather stringent usury law was
in effect in Oklahoma and that this
law provided a penalty for all who vio
lated it.
Street Commissioner Dan Beets ap
peared before the council and stated
the great need of his department for
additional teams. He said that the
hut paved streets should now be work
ed, but he did not have the teams.
Several councilmen expressed them
selves as favoring the purchase of a
team of mules and stated that this
should be done at once as the market
price on horses and mules was ad
vancing by leaps and bounds since the
war with Mexico had become immi
nent. On motion of Councilman Cane
man, seconded by Councilman Linn,
the mattor was turned to the proper
committee with power to act.
Commissioner Beets then informed
the counMl that the street sweeper
which has been in use several years
seemed to nave piayeu us iat iuub.
He said that he had the greater part
of its musical equipment now in a
blacksmith shop; that he knew of a
second hand sweeper now In Chieka
sha which could be bought at a reason
able price. On motion of Councilman
Linn, seconded by Councilman Du
Bose, Commissioner Beets was in
structed to act in the matter of the
purchase of the sweeper.

WHEAT HARVEST IS
BEGUN IN NEBRASKA
Oy United Press.
Lincoln, Neb., June 2?,. Nebraska's
great annual wheat crop harvest has
begun. The largest wheat crop in the
state's history is being gathered
such a crop as the state did not even
dream of ten years ago.
Between 71,000,000 and 74,000,000
bushels of winter wheat is the esti
mate of the states labor bureau,
which also estimated that 7.000 extra
farm hands were needed for the har
vest. Besides this, some spring wheat is
raised in the noi thern section of the
state, but this amount is relatively
small and its harvest will begin in
two or three weeks.
The Hessian fly did some damage
this year as usual, but the pest was
only in certain sections and there
only In small spots. Less damage by
the Hessian fly was done this year
that last.
Hail also did slight damage, some
fields being completely devastated, but
this loss. too. was relatively small.
The wheat crop of Nebraska this
year, it is estimated, will exceed that
of fast year by about 10,00o,oniv bush

One of Meeks Brothers, Charged With
Theft of Hides, Makes Getaway
Enroute to Lone Grove for
Identification
"On again; off again; gone again,"
may now be written In the history of
the doings of the Meeks brothers in
Grady county from the date of their
first landing here, in April, up to the
hour when A. R. Meeks leaped from
the window of a southbound Santa Fe
train yesterday afternoon, as the train,
after leaving Dougherty, was wander
ing about the Arbuckle canyon pre
paratory to making H dive into Ard

the sheriff's office the county attor
ney' suggested taking the prisoners to
Lone Grove for the purpose of having
the agent of the railway company k,

as the parties who shipped the hides.
Yesterday morning the prisoners
left Chi.ckasha for Ardmore and Lone
Grove, in cha.e of Deputy Hugh
j Jlogue, of the sheriff's office,' and Spij

j It was a little after 5 o'clock yester

Meeks, who the officers think Is the
D, C. Mullenhouse to whom all checks
in settlement for hides shipped has
been made by the commission house,
had escaped from the officers by
jumping from the car window as the
train was speeding south out of
Dougherty. Later information stated
that the railway agent at Lone Grove
had failed to identify the other man,
G. F. Meeks, as having been the man
who made the shipment of hides from
Lone Grove to Fort Smith.
Sheriff Bailey stated that O, F.
Meeks would probably be brought back
to the Grady county jail this after
noon or tonight. He said that he was
positive the men captured, who pass
ed as the Meeks brothers, were the
men wanted and that ull kinds of clr
cumstantial evidence had been discov
ered, together with enough direct evi
dence to convict.
Sheriff Bailey said that he felt surfc
the escaped prisoner would be re-captured
in a short time although he re-'
gretted the evident carelessness of
those who had the men in charge,'
which had been responsible for the
getaway of the man most wanted.
A. H. Meeks and his alleged brother,

about how the r.m.i .iii a
In Germany was affeciing civil-
laus. Kditor.
By William a. Shepherd,
(United Press Start correspondent.)
Rotterdam, May 2S. (By mail.)
The German government is regulating
the food supply for the poor but so far'
it has not taken In hand the control
of food for the rich.
The many travelers from Germany
who gave their Ideas' of the German
food situation to me here all com
plained that the wonderful, scientific
food conservation scheme of the Ger
mans broke down when it came to
dealing with the food of the rich.
This is why there are food riots In
Germany. Injustice exists and civil
laus f German towns realiite It.
"Poor people must stand in Una fop
hours before a meat shop, providing
they have five or six marks for a
pound' of meat, "said one German I
met In Rotterdam.
"Maybe the meat supply in the shop
will hold out until their turn comes
In the line and maybe it won't. But
rich people can hire a servant whoso
sole duty is to stand in the meat line
every day, from 1 o'clock In the morn
ing until the day's supply of meat for
the rich man's household Is secure
"And even It the rich man'c servant
falls to buy meat, he fcnd his family
can always ro to a hotel or restau
rant and get meat on every day in the
week except Tuesday and Friday.
"The authorities may frown on a
household going to a restaurant every
day, but there is no law against It and
if the householder doesn't want to b
criticized for dofny this he has only to
go to a different restaurant every day
and his unpatriotic practice will not
be noticed."
The Idea seems to be growing
among the middle and lower classes
in Germany that the only fair way to
xleHl with the food conservation plan
is to put all civilians on a ration basis.
cadi person being granted only a cer
tain quantity of food every day anil
each individual being sure of receiv
ing the full quantity.
"In a war like ours," said this Ger
man, who had socialistic leanlnes.
"there ought to be no rich or poor.
Everybody ought to be on the aamo
basis and many Germans think It i
monstrous that the poor should suffer
more than the rich.
"We all feel that if the war toes
on every person, rich and poor, ought
to be supplied with a daily ration tick
et. With this ticket a poor man will
be certain of receiving all tha food
he needs for his family and the rich,
man will not be able to secure any
more than the poor whether he eats
at a hotel or at home."
it is to placate "'te poor and the
middle classes of Ge?Uau towns that
the government soup wagons pass
through the streets.
The restaurants and rich hotels of
German cities where a una with mon
ey enough had only to go In and ex
press his desires in order to have
them fulfilled, became sources of irri
tation to German civilians.
The government therefor tried to
bring restaurant conditions to t ha peo
ple by establishing the food wagons.
In many households cooking Is al
most a thing of the past. Housekeep

wagon and run out with receptacle
