"We left Casas Grandes Monday

"Captain Boyd immediately dis
patched a courier to the jefe politico
of the little village, advising him that
we were on our way to "Villa Ahu

"In reply to this Colonel Rivas no
tified the American that if he at
tempted the advance he would have to
pass over the dead bodies of the Mexi
cans. He advised Boyd that he had
better not argue the matter.
"Rivas returned to the village to
report to his superior officer, General
Gomez, who, sent out a note inviting
the American to enter Carrizal for a
conference. Captain Boyd declined
this invitation.
"On this ground Gomez went out
in person and insistently urged the
Americans to retire, pointing out
that his orders from his superiors
necessitated his acting on them with
out further parley. General Gomez
repeated the words as he walked
away. Boyd merely answered 'All
right.'

Captain Boyd obstinately seemed to

only "bluffing" and the firing quickly
began. He is quoted further:
"Captain Morrey and Lieutenant
Adair fell mortally wounded Cap
tain Morrey was wounded in the

became demoralized. At the same

NoteThe following is the

the food supply in Germany. He

By William G. Shepherd.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Rotterdam, May 28(By mail)
The German government is regula
ting the food supply for the poor but
so far it has not taken in hand the
control of food for the rich.
The many travelers from Germany
who gave their ideas of the German
food situation to me here all com
plained that the wonderful scientific
food conservation scheme of the Ger
mans broke down when it came to
dealing with the food of the rich.
This is why there are food riots
in Germany. Injustice exists and
civilians of German towns realize it.
Must Stand in Line.
"Poor people must stand in line
for hours before a meat shop, provid
ing they have five or six marks for
a pound of meat," said one German
I met in Rotterdam.
"Maybe the meat supply in the
shop will hold out until their turn
comes in the line and maybe it won't
But rich people can hire a servant
whose sole duty is to stand in the
meat line every day, from 1 o'clock
in the morning until the day's sup
ply of meat for the richJriman's
house-
hold is secured.
"And even if the rich man's ser
vant fails to buy meat, he and his
family can always go to a hotel or
restaurant and get meat on every
day in the week except Tuesday and
Friday.
"The authorities may frown on
a household going to a restaurant
every day, but there is no law
against it and if the householder
doesn't want to be criticized for do
ing this he has only to go to a dif
ferent restaurant every day and his
unpatriotic practice will not be no
ticed."
On Ration Basis.
The idea seems to be growing
among the middle and lower classes
in Germany that the only fair way to
deal with the food conservation plan
is to put all civilians on a ration
basis, each person being granted only
a certain quantity of food every day
and each individual being sure of re
ceiving the full quantity.
"In a war like ours," said this
German, who had Socialistic leanings,
"there ought to be no rich or poor.
Everybody ought to be on the same
basis and many Germans think it
is monstrous that the poor should
suffer more than the rich.
"We all feel that if the war goes
on every person, rich and poor,
ought to be supplied with a daily
ration ticket. With this ticket a
poor man will be certain of receiv
ing all the. food he needs for his
family and the rich man will not be
able to secure any more than the
poor whether he eats at a hotel or at
home.
"It is to placate the poor and mid
dle classes of German towns that th#
government soup wagons pass
through the streets.
The restaurants and rich hotels of
German cities where a man *with
money enough had only to go in and
It Felt Too Lively For A Tree
express his desires in order to have
them fulfilled, become sources of ir
retation to German civilians.
The government therefore tried to
bring restaurant conditions to the
people by establishing food wagons.
Buy Current Meal.
In many households cooking is al
most a thing of the past. House
keepers wait for the passing of the
food wagon and run out with re
ceptacles to purchase the current
meal which usually consists of war
bread and a vegetable soup.
The food wagons, however, while
they may satisfy the hunger of the
populace, do not, I gathered in Rot
terdam, satisfy the popular demand
for more justice in the distribution
of food.
"Put the whole country on ra
tions" is-the solution Mr. Average
Citizen in Germany offers his govern
ment.
"The riots we have been having
are not so much for food as for jus
tice and fair play in the distribution
of food," explained a German from
Berlin.
'The next and concluding food
story from Germany will detail what
articles of food are most used in
Berlin.) SPECIAL TRAIN TO

BEMIDJI CITIZENS
SEE "DAMAGED GOODS"
AT GRAND THEATRE
"Damaged Goods," the sensational
photo-drama of modern life, which
opened at the Grand this afternoon,
had its first showing in this city at
that theater this morning when an
assemblage of prominent Bemidji cit
izens witnessed its run through the
courtesy of the theater and the
Force Photo Co., which is producing
the picture in this city. That "Dam
aged Goods" teaches a great moral
lesson which should be learned by
every citizen, was evidenced through
out the showing of the film by the
comments of several of the profes
sional men present who testified vol
untarily that they had recently en
countered in this section cases sim
ilar to that shown on the screen.
The purpose of the showing was
to give the mayor, other city offi
cials and members of the medical
profession an opportunity to pass on
the picture and to assure themselves
that it did indeed teach the lesson
heralded for it Not only were no
unfavorable comments found, but
every member of the committee
agreed that this film should be seen
by every person who is interested
in his own physical welfare and
that of society generally.
Lessons learned in youth are well
learned and "Damaged Goods" points
the way to a betterment of social
conditions, which if followed cannot
fail to improve the individual and,
through him, society generally
While the plot is intensely interest
ing, the moral of the play is predom
inant over all and the millions who
have already seen "Damaged Goods"
certainly have been impressed in a
most striking way.
In addition to Mayor Vandersluis,
the following gentlemen witnessed
the first run of the film: Dr. C. R.
Sanborn, Dr. L. A. Ward, Dr. A. E.
Henderson, Dr. E. A. Shannon, Dr.
E H. Marcum, Dr. A. V. Garlock,

is Expected May Go to Great
Lakes, 111.
Members of the Bemidji Naval
Militia have been ordered to report
at the city hall tonight at 7:30
o'clock preparatory to receiving a call
for mobilization for Mexican service.
To Recruit Up.
Lieut. E. A. Barker received or
ders yesterday to recruit the militia
up to full strength and recruiting be
gan last evening. Several men have
signified their intention to join the
militia This morning Lieut. Barker
ordered his men to report at the city
hall tonight for arrangement of
equipment and to make other pre
parations for a call.
To Training Camp.
A mobilization call will probably
be issued late today or tomorrow.
Ju&t where the "jackies" will be sent
for service is a matter of conjecture.
It is believed that the militia will
first be shipped to the Great Lakes
naval training station at Great Lakes,
111. From there they will probably
be shipped east.
Ready to "Fall In."
Lieut Barker this morning stated
that his men were ready to "Fall In!"
inside of an hour's time. Perhaps
the only delay in getting to the
training camp would be the railroad
service.
There was much excitement among
the militia members and their fam
ilies today Every moment an order
to move was expected. The men are
eager to be on their way.
From many business houses this
morning came reports that Bemidji
would live up to the past record of
Minnesota for patriotism. It is be
lieved that the militia will be re
cruited to full strength. A number
of business men, employers of labor,
this morning stated that in case the
boys were called to the front that
some arrangements would be made to
hold their places open for them on
their return.
