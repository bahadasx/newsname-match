OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JUNE 23, 1916
UNITED STATES HIT DECK IWUI OK MEXICO
BATTLE BETWEEN CARRANZANIBTAS AND AMERICANS LIKELY TO
PRECIPITATE CRISIS—ALL NATIONAL GUARDS CALLED OCT,
AND PREPARING *X>R IMMEDIATE SERVICE.
An engagement between American
cavalry men and Carranzaisia troops
at Carrizal, Chihuahua, nine miles
southwest of the Mexican field head
quarters, Wednesday, may precipi
tate a declaration of war upon that
country by the United States, if the
official reports bear out the first mea
ger information of the clash. Official
Washington expressed gravest ap
prehension for the future relations
between the United States and the
de facto government, already strain
ed almost to the breaking point, if
the official reports state that the bat
tle was precipitated by the Mexicans.
While officials declined to make
any prophecy, they made no effort to
conceal their anxiety and to indicate
that, if it was a deliberate attempt
to back up the Carranza edict that
General Pershing's men should not
be moved in any direction except
north, President Wilson would ac
cept it as an act of war and make
good hiß word in the last communica
tion to the Carranza government, de
livered only a few hours before this
battle, in which he said that any such
attempt would be followed by "the
gravest consequences."
20 Americans Killed.
Nearly a score of Pershing's men
are said to have been killed in the
battle, while the Mexicans claim 17
others were captured. The Ameri
cans engaged are thought to have
been members of a troop from the
Tenth cavalry, a negro regiment, re
turning to Pershing's headquarters
I from a scouting trip. The comman
der of the Mexican force was killed,
and also some 40 or 50 of his men.
The Mexicans place the blame for the
engagement upon the American com
mander, but American army officers
at EI Paso declared absolute disbe
lief in such assertions and expressed
the opinion that if the American fired
on the Mexicans, they did so because
It was necessary to insure their own
safety.
Developments in the Mexican sit
uation have been taking place rap
idly during the week, beginning with
the calling out of the militia of all
the states by President Wilson, which
will send some 100,000 troops to the
border for General Funston to use,
and will release the regular troops
there for service, if necessary, in
Mexico. An important happening of
the week was the statement sent to
Carranza by President Wilson, refus
ing to withdraw American troops
from that country until banditry had
been suppressed.
Guard Called Out Sunday.
The call for the militia was issued
by President Wilson last Sunday af- (
ter an all-day conference with cabi-
net officials over the situation, and
was transmitted to the governors of
the different states by Newton D. Ba
ker, secretary of war. These orders
directed immediate mobilisation at
company headquarters and recruit-
Auto Truck for Logging.
An auto truck to haul logs to the
mill has been purchased by Pearce
& Balch of Grand Mound. The use
of the auto for logging is an Innova
tion in this vicinity and it is expect
ed the results at the Pearce ft Balch
camp will be watched closely by oth
er logging operators.
Another Candidate for Sheriff.
Former County Commissioner J.
A. Van Eaton, a well-known resident
of the city, has announced his candi
dacy for sheriff, subject to the Re
publican primaries in September.
Since retiring as commissioner, Mr.
Van Eaton has been engaged in the
contracting business and has con
structed several roads in this county.
Suit for a divorce on the grounds
of desertion and a statutory charge
waß filed in the local superior court
this week by Ansel Nystrom, a farmer
who lives near Yelm, against Hazel
Nystrom. He asks for the custody
of their two children.
Weather permitting, the annual
picnic of St. John's church and Sun
day school will be held next Wednes

vented.
in( of the companies to war strength,
followed a few days later by orders
for mobilization at a specified station
within each state and preparations at
these camps to entrain the troops up
on a moment's notice.
Secretary Baker's call for the
Washington National Guard was re
ceived by Governor Lister about 9
o'clock Sunday evening, and was im
mediately transmitted by him with
instructions to mobllifc the compa
nies, to Adjutant General Maurice
Thompson. The Washington officials
worked rapidly and the printed or
ders, confirming those previously
telegraphed or phoned, were in the
mail and on their way to the different
company captains before daylight
Monday morning.
The Washington Guard is now con
centrating at American Lake, near
Tacoma, and under the latest orders
issued by Governor Lister as com
mander-in-chief, every company in
the state is to be at the camp by next
Monday morning, where they will be
taken in charge by a federal officer.
Most of them will be campel at
American lake Sunday. Monday the
governor plans to visit the camp to
review the troops.
Recruiting Many Here.
Recruiting has been in progress in
every city of the state all week and
an office was opened here in the
Kneeland hotel lobby Wednesday by
Sergeant Draham and Privates Ben
Butler and John Gibson of Company
F, the University company. Since
then quite a number of local young
men have enlisted, including Howard
Farrington, Enoch W. Anderson,
Charles M. Schuler, Merritt L. Mc-
Cully, Elmer Maxey, Emmett Selvege,
Martin Butterfield, Donald Barker,
John N- Wallace, E. F. Brown and
Ernst Glaser. Lieutenant E. C. Mur
phy is now in charge of the local re
cruiting.
In addition to these, Walter Le
Poldevin, formerly manager of the
local office of the Western Union
Telegraph company, joined the sig
nal corps to act as an army field op
erator, and Frank Fuller of the fed
eral forestry office joined Troop B of
Tacoma. Donald McFadden, a form
er Olympian, joined his company in
Seattle, while other local young men
who had previously belonged to the
state militia, including Walter Dra
ham, Harold Shaffer, Roy Cage. Jesse
Leverlch, Lloyd Schuler, Merle Mor
ford, James Craig and George Os
borne responded to the Jirst call.
The excitement over the Mexican
situation is prevalent all through the
county and the officers of the local re
cruiting station, which is to be closed
Saturday night, made trips to Little
Rock, Gate, Rochester, Tenino and
other points Thursday to enlist volun
teers. They expect to have at least
30 recruits signed up by Saturday
night.
Tenino to Vote on Bond Issue.
A special school election will be
held in Tenino Saturday to determine
whether or not the directors shall
issue $6,000 worth of bonds for the
purpose of buying a site and building
a two-room school building and gym
nasium. The bonds, if voted, will
bear 6 per cent interest and will run
for a period of 10 years.
The city council Tuesday night, at
the suggestion of Mayor Mottman,
rejected the recommendation of Fire
Chief B. H. Barnes that the city buy
1,000 feet of new fire hose, and placed
an order with the Olympla Hardware
company for 500 feet of hose at 80
cents a foot.
Fire supposed to have started from
a defective flue caused considerable
damage to the home of Dr. N. J. Red

The upper stories of the home were

Kl6llll HELD UP
CHAMBER TRUSTEES REJECT
SNOW AS MANAGER—MEET
ING SATURDAY.
Whether Thurston county is to
jhave a County Fair this year and, if
it does, who its manager is to be, will
be threshed out at a meeting of the
fair committee of the Agricultural
Bureau of the Chamber of Commerce
and the executive committee of the
| Thurston County Pomona Grange at
jthe Chamber of Commerce Saturday
| evening.
The prospects that all plans for the
Fair will be dropped now, following
the refusal of the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce to accept Po
mona Master L. L. Snow as manager,
are reported to be quite bright, as the
Grange representatives are said to be
a unit in favor of Snow while the
Chamber trustees are said to be as
emphatic against him.
This situation arose this week, af
ter the Agricultural Bureau at its
meeting last Friday night had pro
posed plans for the organization of a
permanent Fair Association and these
plans had been accepted last Satur
day by the Grange committee, and an
organization effected. Up to this
point the proposal had been carried
forward enthusiastically and the pros- 1
! pects for a good Fair this year were
; considered quite rosy-
Then the Chamber trustees, at their
j meeting Monday, refused to accept
I Snow as manager and "spilled the
beans " At Saturday's meeting of the
I Bureau's Fair committee and the
Grange officers, Dell Kagy had been
elected president of the proposed
Fair Association and Mr. Snow sec
retary, and the proposal of the Cham
ber trustees that the financial respon
sibility for the Fair be assumed Joint-
Ily by the Chamber and the Pomona
i Grange, had been accepted by the lat
ter's representatives.
The string to this proposal, as it
came from the trustees, was that the
manager of the Fair should be satis
, factory to them as well as to the
Grange and it was under this provi
sion that the trustees turned down
Snow. The whole situation will come
up for consideration at the meeting
of the two committees Saturday night
and will probably resolve itself into
the question whether a Fair will be
held at a'l or not.
I Motion for a re-hearing is to be
made by Henry Roberts, whom the
supreme court last week said must
serve a four-year sentence in the
Monroe reformatory for contributing
to the delinquency of a local girl.
Roberts has been in the county jail
since the supreme court decision was
given last Saturday, when he was
surrendered to the sheriff by his
bondsmen. It sustained the verdict
of a jury in the local superior court,
given at Roberts' second trial.
