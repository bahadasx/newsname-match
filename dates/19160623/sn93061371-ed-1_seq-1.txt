Work Begins on Highway
A working crew cf several
men, teams and tools drove in
Monday morning to begin work
on the' State Highway between
this place and Roswell via the
Acme bridge which is now un
der construction. When this
stretch of road is built it will,
complete the road from El Paso
to Rosweil, Amarillo and east
ern citie?. This will turn the
auto traffic straight through by
way of Kenna instead of seek
ing a southern route as is tha
case now and has been for
years.
The oUlput of New Mexico
mines in 1&15, as reported by
the United State3 fJeological
Survey had a value of more
than $19,000,000. Mr. Charles
W. Henderson of Hie Denver
office of the Survey gives the
detailed production as $1,401,005
in -gold, 2,005,531 ounce3 of sil
ver, 76,788,306 pounds of copper,
4,542,361 pounds of lead, and
25.401,001 pounds of," zinc (in
terms of spelter and zinc in zinc
oxide). These figures show an
increase of $289,309 in gold,
228,086 ounf.es of silver, 17,000,
672 pounds of copper, 2.778, 720
pounds of lead, and 7,000,072
pounds of zinc. The value of
the metals, exceptsilver was
higher than in 1914, . the total
being 41J,27i,368; against , IU,-

Republican opposition : to
VVocdrow Wilsou manifests it
self in much talk in Cougrat
nnd nnf. hi if. when ftrifl fit tin
Wilson administration measur
es comes to a vote, even the Re
publicans dare not opposa it.
The Rural Credits bill passed
the Senate with only five votes
against it; there were only n&ya
in the House of Representatives.
Yet no rural credits 4ni even
reached a vote under republicam
rule. That is a circumstance
that the farmers of the nation
will not 'forget.
In his speech to the National
Pres Club, President WilsQE
based his hope of the ultimate
salvation of the world on' the
'disinterested men and women
who inhabit it. If it were pps
sible to analyze the faith that

Wood row Wilson, it would b
discovered that his disiaterest
dness is his greatest asset. The
people do not believe that he
"plays the ame" for what h
can get out of it for himself.
They do believe that he is in
public life to do public service,
and that he is their good and
faithful servant.
