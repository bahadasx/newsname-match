Car No. 994, overloaded with pas

was crowded, was going north on East

' the car caused by the great load on
:'the running board caused the flanges
.' v.o ift wheels of the forward
truck to lose their grip and the car
- mnnnted the rails and crossed diag-
onally" oyer the street. The brick
block pavement was broken and torn
as the wheels dug into it and the
T-virtr where the : front - trucks
fitoooed. was ground to dust. ; - -
In charge of the car at the time was
Motorraan J. Murphy, whose number

' today it was stated that no report-of
.-the accident had been ' made to the

H. Chapman stated that he knew of
the accident but was unable to state
how it occurred., He said tnat tne ac
-rMent had been caused by ''some
thing," but refused to state what that
'somethinsr" was. '
persons who have been familiar with
traction work state that the accident
is no surprise to them as it has been
',, expected right along and the only sur-.r.-ion
ia tht it had not haopened
eooner. .'The rails throughout tie city
are in a deplorable condition because
the company 1 is unable to .get' laborers
to care for them at the Wage it pays.
and the cars rattle-bang over them as
" thoneh they were ready to fall apart.
On the East Main street line, the
pmnloves of the Arms company are
transported to their work and ajl the
cars around the time tne sniita go on
are loaded wTth passengers. The con
gestion is so great that the running
boards are crowded with persons to
such an extent that tlyj cars roch: a
ereat deal.
When the car left' the track and cut
across the street, all trolley traffic was
held up for 15 minutes and many of
the workmen wereUate at the shops.
When the forward truck of. the car
etruck the curbing, the height was too
great for it to mount and tho churn
ing wheels groond the edge of the
curbstone. The rear of the car was
ewung across the tracks so that no
other cars could pass.
As the passengers on the running
s board 'felt the car mount the rail,
many Jumped, and it was regarded as
fortunate that no one (was fatally in--jured.
All the , passengers were excit
' ed. It looked as though the car was
destined to head straight into the
, buildings on the northwest , corner.
Several persons came very near fall
ing under the wheels in their mad ef
; fort to' escape what appeared to be
' " impending catastrophe. -

accuses Matter of
injuring reputation
Dispute Over Check Precipi
tates Legal Action Involv
ing Prominent Residents.
Alleged slanderous statements aimed
at Andrew . Bandj-e, the wealthiest
banker of ' the West End, , prominent
f araternally and involving members of
the Kakoczy Hungarian Sick. Benefit
society as well as an alderman in thej
district has caused suit, for $3,000 dam
ages to be instituted ,' in the superior
court . "Ji '. '. -v '
Attachments were levied -yesterday
upon property yof John Stefanko. a.
merchant living at 315" Pine street,
who is named a defendant in the "suit.
That, an additional suit against Ste
fanko may also' be brought by Alder
man John Rencay of 572 Bostwick
avenue, is freely predicted, today as a,
result of the widespread comment thai
remarks alleged t.o have been made toy
Stefanko are said to have created in
Hungarian society. -
In . the complaint it is specifically
alleged that Stefanko proclaimed open
ly in front of the banker's ofHce that
the president oil the Rakoczy society
"was a. thief and a check forger."
Behind the legal cloak thrown over
the affair it is related that Bandre sf or
many years has been a leading social
and .financial spirit of the West End.
His trade and fraternal methods have
been business-like and . strict, in ac
cord with the usual business conven
tions. . Not a whisper of scandal has
attached to his conduct.
Mr. Bandre in detailing the cir
cumstances of the affair asserts that-
Stefanko, a . prominent member . of
the Rakoczy society, became' pressed
for money. He appealed to Alder
man Benchy for assistant Renchy,
who is a prominent cafe proprietor
anda director in the West End Coal
Co.. mde out a check payable to Ste
fanko, which, the latter took to the"
banker's office to cash. The banker
'Hfcserts that this check was endorsed
by himself as president of -the society
to give additional prestige to Stefanko
but that it was in no way changed.
Stefanko cashed the check, it Is
claimeu; but later, when asked to pay
the debt, asserted that the fade of the
check had been raised to an amount
larger than hex had -drawn. He re
fused to make -payment and is said to
have at first accused Renchy of dou
ble dealing. Later he is said to have
fuly vindicated Ajderrtian Renchy and
to have apologized for" statements he
had made. ,
The accusations against the banker
followed closely andi are said to have
been so widely made that Bandre has
instituted the slander suit for his own
vindication. Through Attorney Ernest
Berger, member of the firm of Steiber
& Berger, of the First-Bridgeport Na
tional bank building. Sheriff W. jG.
Stiegler eryed the writs of attach
ment in the suit returnable during the
September term of the superior court.

WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERS EARLY
- REPORTS ON BATTLE AT CARRAZAL
Washington, June .23 -A prelimin
ary report from General Pershing on
the Carrizal right, based on stories
told by stragglers reaching the head
quarters of the American expedition
and on ' Mexican rumors, was taken to
the White House early 'today by Sec
retary Baker., . -, .
The secretary said General Pershi.
ing himself did not regard the,-report
as an official statement of what had
happened. The preliminary report
will not Tie "made public. .
Officials are greatly worried over
the delay in getting news from, the
serving officers of the little 10th cav
alry detachment which engaged a su
perior force of Mexicans. Captain
Charles T. Boyd, Lieutenant Henry R.
Adair and 10 men are said to have
been killed. Of the remaining 47
only a few stragglers reached General
Pershing's headquarters yesteraa.
Secretary Baker oeniaa rumors oi
plans for an immediate call for vol
unteers' to add to the regular and na
tional guard forces. He also said
there had been no additional, orders
over night for troop movements.
. "s. Washington Officials
Hope persisted among officials here
today that war against Mexico would
not become necessary. JJespatches
ffom Mexico City indicated that lead
ers in the Carranza government may
show a similar attitude and; will seek
to avert the threatened break. The
outlook was far from bright,!-however,
and orders had bee'n issued for trans
portation of 10,000 national . guards
men to the border rrom central and
western states as soon as they are
ready for service. Secretary Baker
called at the White( House early today
for a conference with the President.
He said he had no reports from Gen
era! pershing regarding the Carrizal
engagement. .
On leaving the White House Mr.
Baker said that there was no change
in the administration policy and that
information from General Pershing
still was waited. He also said no new
orders to regulars or militia had gone
but.

State governors were under orders to
send immediately a statement of when
the troops would be ready for service.
Secretary Baker issued - orders . last
night; to Major General Barry at Chi
