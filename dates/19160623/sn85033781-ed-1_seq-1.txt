SHERIFF BEATT1E

Made Record Run to Hart
ford to Arrest Man For
Firing Buildings
Karly Monday morning Sheritr Beattie
received a telephone message from Hart
ford that Mrs. Dwelliuger'a bare and
tool abed had been set on tire, and that
the party who did H was in the vicinity
of the fire.
Sht-rilT Bt Htti.' at oncn hitch d up his
faithful "Henry" and aroused Lai g from
his peaceful slumbers. Ih? left I'aw
Paw about 2 a. m and arrested one,
John Hayner, and brought him back to
Paw Paw arriving here about W o'clock.
Hayner who is a man of some 50 years
bad been working for Mrs. Dweliinger
for four years Lately she disposed of
of the team which Hayner was driving
and bought an auto. Hayner not being
privileged with the machine became
'sore" and sought revenge. On Sunda)
Hayner stayed in Hartford until about
9 o'clock then went to the farm. On his
arrival he deliberately set tire to the
barn, taking extra pains to see that the j
auto would be sure to go. After setting I
fire to the barn, he sat beside the road
and waited until the flames were well
under way and then aroused the family.
He assisted in trying to put out the tire
to cover up suspicion, but the circum
stances were two evident.
Mrs. DA-ellinger called the sheriff and
Ueattie made a record ruo to the farm,
three miles south, and one mile east of
Hartford.
Hayner admits bis guilt and does Lot
seem to be much woried over the out
come. The charge placed against him
is arson.
Hayner was arraigi.ee in circuit court
yesterday and pleiid guilty to arson . He
will be sentenced this morning
CITY DELIVERY
IS SATISFACTORY
Miss Audr y Cross has completed the
entire course as given at the Western
State Normal at Kalamazoo ai d received
tier diploma from the SHine which will
allow her to teah in ar Pobool in the
state during tier entire life time if she
should so desire.
The city delivery service is now estab
lished and in good working order. The
service as far m QQ be teamed is giving
general satisfaction. Some of the pat
rons have not yet learned thai there is
no such thing as a drop letter in city
delivery. All communications for de
livery must have h two cent stamp af
fixed instead of one cent as heretofore,
The service will be more complete and
convenient for the patrons when the col
lection boxes ave been erected. There
are to be seven boxes placed at conven
ient corners about the city. These
boxes should have been here early in
May, but for soma reason h ,ve not yet
arrived.
An etfort is oeing made to extend the
service to streets that have good hard
dirt sidewalks. At the suggestion of
the postmaster, H. L. McNt il, chairman
of the street committee, took the matter
up with the postodice department. It
was referred back to the postmaster,
who made a favorable report and recom
mended that such streets be added to the
service. f the recommendation re
ceives favorable consi leratio i about 70
families will ba added to the city de
livery service and ever) body will be
happy.

saw three I) ok now nf fus-ong with the
engine and having 5 be hood of the car
raised. Mr. Longwell found that the
machine ird been moved several feet by
parties, probabl) in mi i tfort to Htart '

passenger to Kalamtsoo, and was stand !

his car park d He noticed a stranger
go to his machine and endeavor to start

With the number of cars thereiie now j
it is an eay matter for one to be stolen, j
