Sunday School Convention
- ' at Shiloh
. J. W. Prather, J. B. Graham and
J. W. Purriance, out of a bigness of
heart and loyalty to the Sunday
School cause,. Sunday morning took
seats in J. E. Powers' "Barney" for
historic Shiloh. It was the annual
convention of the Third District, J.
T. Williams president, ,
It Was a very pleasant day for such
a trip. ' Going via Adamsville, the
drive was a "delightful one. The
good people of Adamsville were just
out of their morning nap, though it
was 8:30. Soon we were at the cem
etery, and spent a ' pleasant social
hour with our old friend, Capt. Dean,
. who for 12 years has been the effi
cient superintendent of the cemetery.
It had been several years since we
had visited the cemetery, and during
that time the grounds and general
appearance of this sacred and beauti
ful spot have been improved, and
looked like, nothing more could be
done to add to its beauty. To Capt.
Dean, who greeted ua so cordially,
we were constrained to promise him
to attend the next decoration day, if
alive, and make another talk on the
occasion. , ,
Driving through the Park we came
to the world known Shiloh church,
made sacred by the blood of the "con
tending armies in the great civil war.
The convention was called to order
and several songs sweetly sung by
the choir. When we Bay that A. R.
Boshart was one of the leaders, you
, may know the singing was good. As
ububI, some of those on the program
were not present, but the Selmer con
tingent supplied the waste places
during the day, which added much to
the "gayety of the occasion."
A repast was had at the noon hour
; when Prather, Williams, Graham, and
at least one other enjoyed a most ap
petizing repast.
After an adjournment, fixing Pleas
ant Ridge as the next place of meet
ing, we took our departure, returning
by way of Stantonville, where cold
, drinks and cigars were pleasantly en
'" joyed.'., ,
About two miles from Stantonville
' we met a crippled Maxwell with two
couples of Selmer people and Mr.
' Vestell and a silent engine which
positively refused to go any further.
. After Powers and other mechanicians
experimented with the patient for a
couple of hours, it was thought best
to leave them and return if the old
critter would not go. We left, but
soon after she hove in sight in our
rear, and kept up a lively clip to the
colored church, where she went into
the sulks, and was pulled in by an
. other car. ; ;
All in all we had a most pleasant
trip and came home cooscious in the
. belief that some good seed had been
sown in fertile soil for the great Sun
day School cause,
i Patton Withdraws

mittee, and Judge H. P. Wood, that

jj NEW YORK j
i y ' LETTER $
' One would naturally expect to find
immense stores in New York city, and
they are certainly here, in number.
Among seven millions of people there
are many millionaires, and they can
find plenty of expensive things to buy
here. On lower Broadway the' other
day I saw some glittering gowns ' dis
played in the great windows of a fa
mous store. They seemed to be hung
with finely polished metal strips, with
different rainbow-colors on them.
Then there was a cloak of Russian
black fox fur, with the price of fifty
thousand dollars marked on it. I
find, however, that really good clotheB
are no more expensive here than in
other places, and that the famous
places of business are extremely care
ful to satisfy the customers.
My watch needed cleaning, .and I
took it to John Wanamaker's. That
was a store worth seeing. There are
many different departments, and per
haps five times aa many clerks in that
one place of business as there are
people in Selmer. As I walked into
a rear entrance from the subway I
went through department after de
partment till I reached the grand en
trance on Ninth street, where an
enqjraous man of color, with," the
grace and the elegant accent of a
senator, told me how to find the
watch, depatrment: go across the
street to the other part of the store,
etc. The man looked like a
very handsome negro, but he said he
was an East Indian, I suspected that
Charleston, South Carolina, was as
near as he had been to the East In
dies. He was in uniform, had a voice
like a bass drum, and was at least 6
feet 6. Be had a brother in the oth
er store that looked like his twin.
The two niggers perhaps get almost
as much as a congressman. -
Most of the clerks seemed to be
women, all dressed in dark uniforms,
aqd all as polite and nice as could
be. After passing through the fine
goods, book and stationary depart
ments, I came to the watch section,
handed over "my ticker,.. and got , a
cheap one to carry, with Wanamaker's
name engraved in big letters, till
mine was repaired, which took ten
days. Two dollars and a half was
the price, only for cleaning, but when
I got it back it was like a new watch.
I told the manager of that floor, a
nice-looking man of about 50, that I
wanted some information about the
store, for use in an article for the
McNairy, Tennessee, Independent, for
the benefit of the . readers, and not
necessarily to advertise the store.
He said I should go up to Mr. So and
So on the 10th floor, who would give
me a full, history, but I told him 1
would tale what he had to say. Then
he proceeded to tell me the following
interesting particulars: ,
John Wanamakar makes his home
in Philadelphia. It was there that
he nfade his start in business, but
his New York branch is rapidly out
growing other side stores. The man
ager here gets $30,000 a year, and
there are a number cf buyers for the
store who receive $12,000 to $20,000
a year for their services. Some of
these are women, and their judgement
as to styles and qualities is of great
value to the business. The lowest-paid
employees are the messenger and cash
boys who receive 1 $3.50 to $6.00 a
week. There is a system of ' promo
tions which raises the salaries of
these lower grades as they show
their ability to do the work better.
There is also a sick fund to which all
contribute who so desire, and the
sick ones are thus eared for while
laid up; and there ii also a fund for
burying the dead.
There are forty-five acres of floor
apace in the Wanamaker store, which
covers parts of two blocks from
Eighth to Tenth streets. Down un
der Ninth street it is all store, and
busy crowds circulate there and buy
theMr.choice of goods, regardless of
the multitudes of people and throngs
of automobiles passing over their
heads on the street above. The busi
ness moves on like a mighty river,
with Utile noise but great power, and
it is a tribute to the strength and ma
jestyofa gsod name, which, while
"greater than riches" means riches
tsolf when applied to a business hero.
The name of John Wanamaker attach
ed to any guarentee or any proper
si tion will gain public favor, no mat
ter what the object He has spent
the greatest part of a long life (he
must be far over 70, now) in building
up this immense business, but if one
were to ask him of which he was the
most proud, he would undoubtedly
say: "my Sunday School." For many
years he has taught Sunday school in
Philadelphia, and may be doing it yet,
for ought I know.
The only time I - ever saw John
Wanamaker was in 1892. when my
brother and 1, then in Washington,
called at the Post Office Department
to get a look at him. He was then
postmaster general. We had no bus
iness on earth with him; just wanted
to look at him, that was all, for we
had read a lot about him. Entering
the ante-room of bis office and look
ing at the Blick nigger that stood
guard there, we got scared, and be
gan to wish we might not find Mr.
Wanamaker there. . But we did, and
very soon a slender, gray-haired man
with a kindly but very keen counten
ance stepped in, so spick-and-span
looking that he seemed to have come
from a band-box in one of hia own
stores, and shook hands with us, and
wanted to know how he could serve
us. What could we say! I managed
to blurt but that we were from Flor
ida, and had heard of him. It seemed
to please him that anybody from as
far away as Florida had heard of
John Wanamaker, and he smiled his
brightest and said something nice to
us, which I have now forgotten. Some
way we got out of it, without making
downright fools of ourselves' but I
suspect that he more than once
smiled in thinking of bur awkward
visit to him, and knew we only want
ed to look him over. His store here
is at the old A. T. Stewart stand.
Stewart was one of the first of the
famous merchant princes of . New
York, and he was made particularly
noteworthy after his death by the act
of Borne ghouls in breaking into his
tomb and stealing his body. I don't
think it ever was recovered.
The biggest store in New 'York is
that of B. Altman, perhaps, on Fifth
avenue. Then there is Gimbel Broth
ers, Macy'a, etc. The latter store
occupies a corner site, except that
right at the outer corner there is a
little building which ( no 'amount of
money seems to be able to buy. No
doubt Macy would be willing to give
the owner several times its real value
in order to own the whole corner, but
he cannot get it ,
, I inquired as to the rental values
along Park Row and other places.
One man. who hud about twenty-five
feet front, told me he had to pay
$1,000 a month for the one room.
There is a store somewhere here that
is only three feet wide, used as a
cobbler shop, and it is always rented
at a good price.
The New York Tribune runs , a de
partment in its paper called the "Ad-
Visor," in which, two or three times
a week,' people are privileged to tell
of places where they have been swin
dled by merchants. The writers whose
letters are printed get two dollars
apiece for them, and some of the let
ters praise good treatment, while
others show up sharp practices.
Names and locations of stores, and
the whole transaction, whether good
or bad, appear in that column, and its
publication has had a very wholesome
effect upon business men generally,
for to be shown up in that great
newspaper as a fraud and a cheat is'a
great damage to any firm. Many of
coutse threaten to sue for damages,
but the Tribune says all comers in
that line will be made welcome, and
somebody gets hit every week, some
of them big firms carrying millions in
stock.
So far as I have seen, a person of
ordinary intelligence stands no more
risk of getting cheated here in pur
chases than he would anywhere else
He must keep his eyes open for short
change artists, bad money sharps,
etc. (There is little money here that
is not good, although you occasionally
see a Canadian dime or quarter.) The
ticket sellers in the subway and ele
vated stations have to be mighty
quick on points like that.

The Problem of Tuberculosis
(A Paper read ' before the McKalry
County Mediilal Society, at Stanton
ville, Tennesste, June 15, 1916, by
Dr. T. G. Jackson, of Gravelbill ). -
The Problem of Tuberculosis; The
Responsibilities and Obligation
Devolving Upon the Public, and the
Profession.
In solving any problem of the com
munity, agitation, discussion and edu
cation of the public . is necessary.
The great White Plague has been so
insiduously, so unrelentlessly, and so
unremittingly gathering in its unfor
tunate victims,! that the public and
the Medical Profession have become
somewhat hardened to the tragedies
surrounding us. We are appalled at
the slaughter of1-the European war;
over one million men have been killed,
yet this is no more than the estimat
ed death rate of Europe from Tuber
culosis yearly. In the United States
in 190C the death rate from Tubercu
losis was one hundred , and thirty
eight thousand. This statement was
made by Irving Fisher, 'Professor of
Political Economy of Yale University,
who also estimated that the yearly
death rate in the United States equal
ed the combined deaths from typhoid
fever, scarlet fever, smallpox, dip
thera; cancer, diabetes, appendicitis,
and meningitis. If this condition be
true and it is beyond dispute why
is it that our counties, cities, states
and our Federal government allow
this ; condition to continue? Public
funds are spent, trained men on fixed
salaries are employed and stringent
regulations are enforced to check and
eradicate other infectious diseases
that do not carry off one tenth part
of the population as that ; caused by
Tuberculosis.' Is this1 country sd, nig
gardly as to its expenditures, ttfat the
money involved in'a campaign against
so great a foe is too -staggering for'
our politicians? Would not an active
campaign with inbney tb fight 'this
dread disease be a' good investment?
Dr. Osier estimates that7 in the
United States there are a million and
a quarter at all times suffering from
Tuberculosis, figuring that at least
one fourth of this number are unable
to work. At one dollar and fifty
cents per day, this would mean a loss
of wages from these disabled con
sumptives to the amount of One' Hun
dred and Forty Million Dollars yearly.
Not only that, but the expense of
these sick upon their families added
to the loss in wages means a loss to
the people of the United States of
Five Million Dollars Yearly. '
If the United States can stand a
loss to its people of this amount,
would it not be a good business policy
to spend at least that much yearly to
curtail and ultimateiy eradicate this
terrible scourge? If that amount was
placed in the hands of a National
Bureau of Health yearly, a grip would
be taken on this great Bcourge that
would mean its ultimate eradication.
In the time allotted for such a pa
per as this it will, be impossible to
enumerate, and elaborate, on all the
measures that will help to curtail this
dread disease, the more important of
which are: First, early diagnosis, and
the adoption of radical treatment;
Second, the prevention of indiscrimi
nate expectoration; Third, the de
struction of sunless, illy ventilated,
windowlesp. sleeping' rooms; Fourth,
the establishment of better sanitation
in workshop, industrial plants, private
dwellings, schools, and assembly halls;
Fifth, the 'establishment of sanitari
ums for curable diseases; . Sixth, the
establishment of hospitals for ad
vanced canes, not only for. the relief
of these patients, but to remove a
source of massive infection from chil
dren and adults where such consump
tives may live; Seventh, and finally,
the education of fathers and mothers,
and their growing children just com
ing into adolescence, that the . best,
prevention against tuberculosis is the
avoidance of dark and poorly ventil
ated houses, the avoidance of milk
from tuberculous cows, the avoidance
of poor food, the avoidance of late
hours and dissipation, and the avoid
ance of long hours of over work, or
over study. , .
It is to be regretted that in the
above list of preventive measures
there could not be listed a vaccine
producing immunity; but there is, at
present no vaccine of proven and re
liable , value. -Fortunate it is for
humanity that we receive our vaccina
tion-of living bacilla in sufficiently
small doses in early life, that a de
gree of immunity is produced to af
ford protection from activity of this
disease to the majority of humanity.
Naglie has found that 97' per cent
of all adults who die of diseases other
than Tuberculosis are somewhat tu
berculous The patient, then, who
develops Tuberculosis and w-ho " along
with their families try to figure out
where they received - the infection,
would do better if they would think
over the ways and times when they
have lowered their vitality, and Na
tural Resistance that caused de velop
ment and activity of the disease. ,' -f
To summarize; the public must be
educated to the fact that the preven
tion of, and eradication of Tuberculo
sis is not the task of the medical pro
fession alone, but at least , 90 per
cent of the responsibility is ' upon
their shoulders. . The'public , must be
educated to the fact that a National
Bureau of Health with sufficient funds
to fight effectively such a dread dis
ease as this is as important in our
national defense, ai is our National
Defense against foreign invasion.
And finally, to help check the
spread of Tuberculosis, and to help to
ultimately eradicate this terrible
scourge is worthy of th best efforts
of every practitioner of medicine, and
should elicit the loyal and energetic
support of every citizens of these
great United States.

The Wise Saying of a
Great Business Man . .
When you get a good customer strive to keep him, but
when you get a bad one strive to keep yourself. The Mc
Caskey System will help you to this end. The desirable cus
tomer will appreciate and is really entitled to an itemized
statement of his account with each purchase. The Mer
chant can furnish it to him with no extra cost or labor with'
the McCaskey System. The undesirable customer don't
want to know, neither does he want his merchant to know
what he owes. The McCaskey System keeps both posted.
Take the wise saying of the great business man; keep
your good customer by furnishing him with an itemized state
ment of his account. Keep yourself from the clutches of
your bad customer by keeping yourself posted.
The McCaskey Register
