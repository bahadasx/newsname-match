El Paso, June 23. -Unconfirmed re
ports received here today stated that
Troops f and K of the Tenth cavalry
were practically annihilated in the
fight in Carrizal, when led into the
Carranztsta trap.
The little handful of American sol

back. The Mexican . cavalry - poured
show down on the United States cav
alrymen, whose mounts had stamped
ed after the troopers had dismounted
to fight, declared a few private ad
vices. It was stated that General Pershing
had sent a strong column to rescue
the scattered remnants of the force,
who are declared to be without food
and water. The relief column was
reported racing along the dry bed of
the Rio Comer toward Carrizal.
These advices are contradicted by
official Mexican reports.
"So News from Pershing.
San Antonio, June 23. Whether the
little force of the Tenth United States
cavalry under Capt. Charles T. Boyd,
fought their way out successfully
through the ring of Mexican troops
which had almost surrounded them at
Carrizal June 21 still was unknown at
General Funston's headquarters to
day. No news from Genera! Pershing
has been received since the arrival
late last night of the report based on
the stories of several stragglers who
made their way back to the main col
umn before the fighting at Carrizal
had ended. General Funston expects
a complete report at any moment.
however, as it was believed General
Pershing soon would have word from
the two squadrons of the Eleventh
cavalry which he sent out to meet and
reinforce Captain Boyd's men.
Search for Wounded.
Columbus, N M June 23. General
Persnim: has sent out large scouting
patrols to locate wounded stragglers of
the ill-fated negro patrol which en
countered Carranza troops at Carrizel
Wednesday, it was learned here today.
To date seven horse holders of the cav
alry detachment are known to have
returned to their base. Fear is ex
pressed in some quarters that the
American losses may have been great

sources.
ROBINS DESERTS
Progressive Chairman
Back to Democrats.

At Obsequies for Bull Moose,
Party Declared Dead.
Chicago, June 23. Raymond Robins,
chairman of the last Progressive na
tional convention, announced today he
is going back into the Democratic
party.
Oeclaring the Progressives dead as
a national organization, Robins told
Illinois Bull Moosers. gathered here
for a "funeral conference," today that
Theodore Roosevelt. Governor Hiram
Johnson of California. James W. Gar
field of Ohio and Giffird Pinchot of
Pennsylvania all have gone back into
the G. O. P.
"These things are settled in my
mind." Robins said. "There is no
hope for us as a party. I will not join
the Republicans if the rest of you do.
I will go back into the Democratic
party." '
Senliment at the conference of the
Bull Moosers seemed largely in favor
of joining with the progressive wing of
the Republicans in this state, perhaps
with the view of electing President
Kdmund J. James of the University of
Illinois for governor.
They plan to get control of the Re-
publican party, they said, by aligning

Washington. June 23. Secretary
Baker today issued orders to all army
departmental commanders to send to
the Mexican border all guardsmen
available immediately upon their or
ganization without waiting for com
pletion of the mobilization of the sep
arate states.
The cemmanders were requested to
notify General Funston when each
troop, battery or other unit completes
muster. General Funston will indi
cate where he wishes the forces sent
in each instance, and the departmental
commander, without further instruc
tions from Washington, will arrange

Washington,'' June 23. Immediate
action on his resolution , authorising
the president to draft into the federal
service national guardsmen willing to
take the oath under the new army law
was asked in the house today by
Chairman Hay of the military com
mittee. At the same time he offered
an amendment to declare that the
emergency for the draft now exists,
instead of leaving the question to be
determined by the president.
Questioned by Republican Leader
Mann and others, Mr. Hay said that
the resolution did not contemplate a
state of war but that the mere fact
of the introduction of the resolution
handed to him by the war department
"shows that in the opinion of the
executive the emergency does exist
and that this resolution is absolutely
necessary to meet the emergency."
Congress Will Xot Interfere.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, called at the
state department early seeking infor
mation about the situation. He was
told by Secretary Lansing there I.ad
been no new developments. Mr. Stone
said congress would do nothing in the
crisis that might interfere with nego-
nations Detween.tne state department j
and the de facto Mexican
govern-
ment.
Await Pershing's Full Report.
Washington, June 23. A prelimi
nary report from General Pershing on
the Carrizal fight based on stories told
by stragglers reaching the headquar
ters of the American expedition and
on Mexican rumors was taken to the
White House early today by Secretary
Baker. The secretary said General
Pershing himself did not regard the
report as an official statement of what
had happened and indicated that n
attempt to decide the course to bi
pursued by the United States would
be made until a complete account has
been received.
In the meantime the preliminary re
port will not be made public, although
it is understood to be substantially in
accord with the version given in bor
der press dispatches last night. Offi
cials are greatly worried over the de
lay in getting news from the surviv
ing officers of the Tenth cavalry de-
tacnment wnicn engaged a superior,
force of Mexicans. According to
Mexican official accounts there were
about seventy-six Americans, seven
teen of whom were taken prisoner.
Capt. Charles T. Boyd. Lieut. Henry
A. Adair and ten men are said to have,
been killed. Of the remaining forty
seven only a few stragglers reached
General Pershing's headquarters yes
terday and today there had been no
word from the two cavalry troops sent
out to pet in touch with the shattered
command. General Pershing said he
hoped to have a report from surviving
officers by courier during the day.
Secretary Baker, denied rumors of
i plans for an immediate call for volur..
teers to add to tne regular and na
tional guard force. He also said thera
had been no additional orders over
night for troop movements.
Gets New Rush Order.
New York, June 23. The depart
ment of the east was notified by the
war department today that as soon as
national guards organizations under
its control are ready they will be dis
patched to the border "without a mo
ment's unreasonable delay."
Washington, June 23. After a cab
inet meeting that lasted nearly two
hours. Secretary Lansing said there
had been no change in the situation
and that a complete -eport from the

VISIONS
NEEDS 1,000 MEN
Kansas Guard Mast Have That
Number of New Recruits.
To Put the Organization on a
War Footing.
Kansas companies will need nearly
1,000 men to bring the national guard
organization to full war footing, ac
cording to an estimate today by Gen
eral Martin. That sufficient men may
be recruited,' officers will be stationed
in all towns where guard companies
have been maintained and a campaign
will be conducted for recruits. Ap
plicants for enlistment may apply
either at local recruiting stations or to
officers at Fort Riley.
"We will make an active campaign
for more recruits," said General Mar
tin this afternoon.. "Some of the com
panies are barely above the minimum
strength, while others are recruited to
almost full war strength. It is prob
able that 900 or 1,000 men are needed
to bring the Kansas guards to full war
footing. For that reason recruiting
officers will be stationed in all towns
where local companies have been
maintained. Recruiting will also con
tinue at Fort Riley." ,

WHEAT fMNSE
Prospects Exceed All v Former
Crops Except Two.
Mohler -Estimates . Enormons
Yield of Over 90,000,000 Bu.
. Wheat prospects in Kansas have in
sixty days slumped S6 million bushels.
Report' by- J.' C. Mohler, secretary of
the state board of agriculture, esti
mates the wheat at 90,226.000 bush
els. In May Mohler anticipated a
crop of 108,000,000 bushels, while a
report for -April placed the probable
yield at 126,000,000 bushels. Hessian
fly and unfavorable weather condi
tions are responsible for the slump, i
Mohler states.
Still this is a remarkable showing
for Kansas wheat and the estimate in- j
dicates a crop the greatest in the his
tory of Kansas save for the exceptional
year of 1914 and the yield- of last
year which was 95,141,207 bushels.
Com conditions "have greatly im
proved in sixty days, according to re
ports sent to Mother's office. He esti
mates a condition of 81.2 or 16.2
better than a year ago and reports
an acreage of 6,670,000, or 47 per
cent greater than in 1915. Condition
of oats slumped 12.5 points in thirty
days. Mohler estimates the condition
of the Kansas oat crop at 63.2 per
cent. The Kansas acreage is 1,405,000.
The Report.
The Mohler report follows:
Winter Wheat. Correspondents
now estimate a prospective yield of
90,226,000 bushels of winter wheat in
Kansas this year, or an average yield
of 11.63 bushels per acre, on 7.754,000
acres. This is a falling off. in a
month, of nearly 18,000.000 bushels in
the aggregate, about two bushels in
the acre-yield and a total abandon
ment since April ot 256.000 acres.
The board has received from eighty
four of the state's counties the offi
cial assessors' returns of acreages in
various crops. These show more
wheat sown last fall by 2.2 per cent
than the growers had estimated.
Should this increase be maintained by
the returns of the twenty-one counties
yet to be received, the total area sown
last fall would amount to 8,640,000
acres, as against the 8,454,000 acres
estimated by the growers. This gain,
however, is more than offset by the
increased area abandoned or considered
worthless, which, according to present
advices, amounts to nearly 10 per cent
for the state as a whole, as against 5
per cent in April. This increase in loss
is due to development of damage by
the Hessian Oy; to dry weather in
many of the western counties that

San Antonio, June 23. Genera!
Funston eagerly awaited today fur
ther details from General Pershing of
the attack near Carrizal by a greatly
superior force of Mexicans under Gen.
Felix Gomez, on troops C and K of the
Tenth United States cavalry under
Capt. Charles Boyd.
The final outcome of the battle was
not made known in General Pershing
report received at headquarters late
last night nor was any indication given
of the number of casualties suffered
by the little American force which had
been almost entirely surrounded by a
ring of Mexican troops. The report
was based on the stories of several
stragglers, who had made their way
back to the main column. These men
apparently had been horse-holders,
not actively engaged, and- had made
their escape -before the fighting was
over.- According to the story told
Oeneral Pershing by the stragglers
the . attack was entirely unprovoked
and was made after the Mexican fore
had partly surrounded the -Americans
under cover of a parley between Gen
eral Gomez and Captain Boyd. It was
not until after the Mexicans had
opened with a machine gun on the
American troopers that Captain- Boyd
dismounted his command and re
turned the fire, according to the strag
glers' story.
Reached Carrizal at 7:30 a. m.
They reported to General Pershing
that the forces under Captain Hoyd
and Capt. Lewis S. Morey joined at
Ojo Santo Domingo on Jane 20 and
proceeded together toward Carrizal.
arriving within a mile of that town at
7:30 a. m. on June 21. Captain Boyd,
the senior officer, ordered a halt at
that point and sent a courier into
Carrizal asking permission of the
Mexican commander to pass through
the town. This permission was re
fused, according to the courier, hut
while he was making his report a nrtes
senger arrived from General Gomes
with word that -the American troops
would be allowed to pass through
provided Captain Boyd would stop
within the town for a parley.
