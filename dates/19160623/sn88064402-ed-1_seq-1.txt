In the absence of Mrs. Kate Wil

acts upon the children. The Sunday

Welsh Boys Take Some Ego ti
Out of Calcasieu Metropolis n
The home team placed Welsh per- p
manently on the base ball map last
Sunday when they defeated the Lake s
Charles aggregation in a fast nine t
innings by a score of 6 to 2. ii
The Lake Charles team knew they I
were the best in the State-there was a
no doubt of it-so they came to r
Welsh with the avowed purpose of F
mopping-up with the Welsh nine. i
What they lacked in ability they
made up for in enthusiasm, and what I
they expected to do was promptly
done to them.
The game was one of the most
interesting ever witnessed on the
Welsh diamond and was marked by a
number of spectacular plays, home
runs being scored by Nug Romero and
Jim Robinson for the Welsh nine and
Buck Lyons for Lake Charles.
A good sized crowd attended the
game, including numerous fasn from
Lake Charles and Jennings.
The winning of this game gives
the Welsh nine an average of 666
23- per cent., they having won four
games and lost two.
The Wels hboys play Elton at El
ton next Sunday, and Lake Arthur
at Welsh the Sunday after.

BAND STAND COMPLETED
IN THE CITY PARK
The combined efforts of the band in
boys, the city council and progressive se
citizens have been rewarded by the '
completion of an imposing and ac
commodating band stand on the city e`
block. Electric lights are being in
stalled in the stand and it will be
painted within a few days .
The new stand will be used for the m
regular practice meetings of the
band and periodical concerts which ft
are looked forward to by the entire l1
citizerny of this section. There is 8
nothing in the entertainment line, un- a
less it might be a dog fight, that will P]
)ring out a larger crowd than a her- is
alded band concert. h'
The Wlesh band, under the leader- ti
ship of Andy Notestine, comprises fI
some seventee nor more pieces, and si
is one of the best musical aggrega- h
tions in this section of the State, and
the efforts of the members are com- it
mendable. The boys should have the V
hearty co-operation of the prorgessive w
people here, in their efforts. p
The placign of a few comfortable s
settees on the grounds convenient to c
the band stand, a task which we are
informed devolves on the Civic e
League, would add wonderfully to the a
attractiveness of the city park, and h
make it a very comfortable lounging li
place during these hot summer even- I
ings. t
THE CIVIC LEAGUE
HAS BEEN ACTIVE h
The clean-up committee of the
Civic League, under the efficient
chairmanship of Mrs. Dr. J. B. God
frey, has been extremely active dur
ing the past week, having conducted
an effective onslaught against weeds, f
grass and all unsightly things which t
tend to mar the civic beauty of the
municipality.
About the time that President Wil
son delivered his ultimatum to the
beligerent Mecxians, the Civic League °
sounded the death knell to weeds,
etc., in Weslh. The president's task c
is only partly formulated "while the
Civic League has made wondrous
strides toward the accomplishment of
their purpose, and in a few days I
more the city of Welsh will present
an appearance of striking beauty.
Much credit is due to this ener
getic organization for their effective
f efforts, and especially to the mana
1 gerial ability of the chairman of the
clean-up committee.

THE HUDSON IN HISTORY.
(By James W. Hervey.)
The Hudson, beautiful and allur
ing as it is on the surface, also pos
sesses treasure of fact and fancy
which only the hand of research can
bring to light. To him who has delved
even superficially into the vast array
of historic and legendary lore of this
fascinating region, the Hudson Val
ley becomes a vast storehouse of the
most absorbing material.
Fortified with the fruits of delight
ful explorations among the abundant
literature of the river, the traveler
sees the Hudson in entirely new
aspects. Added to his ability to ap
preciate its natural attractiveness, he
is now able to place each cove and
headline in its correct historic set
ting, surround it with the strange and
fantastic figures of legend and
story, and people it with the early
heroes of colonial days.
Revolutionary times left much of
interest here. Directly south of the
West Shore Terminal is the spot
where the Burr-Hamilton duel took
place. Block House Point was the
scene of the "cow chase," which the
clever Andre described in verse after
"Light Horse Harry" Lee and Gen
eral Wayne had driven the British
and their cattle from that point. The
history of Fort Lee, which figured
largely in Washington's evacuation of
New York in 1776 is so familiar as
to need little mention here. An ar
tistic monument marks its location.
Alpine and its 150-year-old farm
house, once the headquarters of Lord
Cornwallis, brings back memories of
the two invasions of New Jersey at
that point by Cornwallis and Grey, re
spectively. Sneden's Landing, just
opposite Dobb's Ferry, marks the
anchorage ground of a British fleet
from 1776 to 1778, and the spot where
the American flag was first saluted
by the Mother Country.
These few facts about the river re
gion nearest New York are indicative
of the wonderful historical storehouse
which extends throughout the length
of the Hudson River Valley.
About the Tappan Zee, which is
three and one-quarter miles across at
its widest centers the legendary
lore of the lower river. Here Ram
bout Van Dam is doomed to perpetual
rowing for Sabbath-breaking indis
cretions in Manhattan's early days.
These extensive waters are also the
favorite sailing ground of the phan
ton "Flying Dutchman," which as
tonished Peter Stuyvestant and his
worthy burghers by appearing mys
teriously before the Battery one day
and then sailing up the North river
against tide and wind never to re
turn. Coming down to more authen
tic times, we hear of the brave ex
ploit of Captain Hurlbut and his
crew at Tarrytown. Being driven
from two "rebe'l" supply ships after a
desperate conflict with the English,
they swam back to their abandoned
charges after the enemy had set fire
to them, and at great risk of ex
pected powder explosions, put out
the flames and saved the stores from
a foe already rejoicing in their de
struction.
And so it goes; each mile of the
journey unfolds its visions of the
past. The broad waters of the Tip
pan Zee give way to the rock-hewn
channel of the Highlands, where ev
ery mountain had its beacon fires of
liberty and every promontory its pa
triot fortifications. Stony Point, Dun
derburg, and Bear Mountain, Storm
King, Break Neck, Anthony's Nose
and all the rest pass in majestic pro
cession, while peekskill, a memorial to
the Dutchman, Jans Peek, who, get
ting stuck in the mud there, decided to
settle in that spot for life, and West
Point, "cradle of the American Army"
show the hand of man in the region.
Further on, Newburg, settled by Ger
man palitines; Fishkill, sight of the
first land purchase in Dutchess
County; Paughkeepsie, famous for its
Vassar, the pioneer Woman's Col
lege in America; Hyde Park, named
after Lady Anne Hyde, afterwards
Queen of England, and Kingston,
where the first New York Constitu
tisn was drafted, pass in review. By
this time the matchless Catskills-the
"Mountains of the Sky"-where Rip
Van Winkle slept and played at nine
pins-are visible for a long distance.
Then follow Tivoli, Germantown, Cat
skill, Hudson (once a prosperous
whaling port,) and Kinderhook, the
Children's Corner, until finally Albany,
the capital city and scene of a thous
ands historic events, is reached.
Just a word about tCie large and
beautiful steamers which run on the
Hudson for the accommodation of the
public. For beauty, speed, safety
and comfort they stand unsurpassed
among vessels of teir kind. The
"Robert ,Fulton," named in honor of
the man who first sailed a steam
boat on the Hudson decades ago.
This is the boat on which I took my
'delightful trip on the Hudson. She
- Is licensed to carry 4,000 passengers.
i Her engine develops 3,850 horse
power. ( More later.)
