Germans Storming Ft. Souville
With Great Violence.
Were Preparing for Seventh
Assault Eighteen Days.
BATTLE RAGES SOME FRONT
Crisis at Hand in Second Phase
of British Offensive.
Germans Throw Two Entire
Corps to Defense Bapaume.
BY HENRY WOOD.
Paris, July 13. Dense German
masses are storming the approaches
to Fort Souville in the seventh great
assault on Verdun since the battle
for the fortress began 116 days ago.
The violence of yesterday's attacks
furnish unmistakable evidence that
Germany is determined to continue
the attack on Verdun, regardless of
her critical position on other fronts.
French military critics agreed on this
point today after studying the re
ports from headquarters.
The present attack began Tuesday.
The Germans had spent eighteen days
in preparation. They brought up new
guns and trench mortars, shifted
more troops from the west bank of
the Meuse and hurried fresh sup
plies of ammunition to the Souvilla
Damloup sector.
75's Take Terrible Toll.
The French, ready to meet the
shock, turned loose a sheeted fire into
the advancing German ranks and
took terrible toll with the "75 s".
Througnout Tuesday night and all day
yesterday the battle rased on the
Souville-Damloup sector, the French
counter-attacking with great spirit.
Only at one point, near the intersec
tion of the Fleury and Vaux roads,
did the Germans gain any ground.
In the Champagne, the French pen
etrated a salient in the German line,
akinfr prisoners. In the Argonne, a
German attack northeast of Bolante
was checked by French fire. In the
Vosges a German attack south of Car
apach was repulsed after a violent
grenade combat.
New Crisis for British Near.
London, July 13. The secondphase
of the British offensive Is approaching
a crisis in the battle northeast of Al
bert, where British troops are striving
to advance two miles eastward to the
heights of Martinpuch.
The Germans have thrown two
whole army corps into action on both
sidos of the Albert-Bapaume road to
defend the approaches to Bapaume.
They are making the most savage
counter-attacks, particularly south
east of Contalmaison, where a Ger
man success would hold up the whole j
British advance.
German correspondents, admitting
the great power of the British offen
sive, claim that the attacking forces
have suffered heavy losses comparable
only to the casualties at Verdun. Brit
ish correspondents report that the
English losses have been severe only
in the death grapples for possession of
villages where German machine guns
have played on the British lines .
Lull on Kovel Front.
No Canadian or Australian troops
have taken part in the Somme of
fensive thus far, but the Newfound
land troops have distinguished them
selves, according to reports from
British headquarters.
"The Newfoundland battalion was
pushed up in what may be called the
third wave in ti e attack on probably
the most formidable section of the
whole German front, through an al
most overwhelming artillery fire and
across ground swept by machine fire
from hidden positions," said one dis
patch. "The men behaved with com
pletely noble steadiness and courage."
On the eastern front the operations
east of Kovel have reached a tem
porary lull with the Russians and
Austro-Germans redistributing their
forces and bringing up artillery along
the Stoched river for a renewal of
heavy fighting.
Paris, July 13. Today's official
statement of the French office of war
follows:
"There have been intermittent artil
lery exchanges along the front of the
River Somme.
"In the Champagne district we pen
etrated a salient of the German line
In the vicinity of Prosnes and brought
back some prisoners.
"In the Argonne two surprise at
tacks delivered by the enemy on the
northern and eastern portions of the
Bolante salient failed under fire. At
Deadman's Hill we caused the ex
plosion of a mine and then occupied
the southern side of the crater.
"On the right bank of the River
Meuse there has been no infantry
fighting. During the night, however,
there was an intense bombardment in
the sectors of Souville, Chenois and La
Laufee.
"In the Vosges an attack by the
enemy upon one of our trenches south
of ("arspach has been repulsed after a
spirited engagement with hand gren
ades." AUTOS AND GIRLS WIN!
And Ed O'Donnell, 19, Has Shortage
of $1,600 and Loses.
Des Moines. Ia.. July 13. Fast
autos and pretty girls to ride in them
in the brisht lights are given by
friends as the cause for the alleged
shortage of Ed O'Donnell, 18, messen
ger for the Wells Fargo Express com
pany, of $1,600. No charge has been
made against O'Donnell as yet but po
lice say he has spent $100 u dat since
July 1. when the package of $2,000
disappeared and that when taken into
cu-tody for investigation he turned
over $400 of the money.
AUDIT UNDER WAY
City in Books of Edison and
Kailway Companies.
May ot Examine Daily Slips
and Save $350.
EXAMINATION COVERS ALL
Nothing To Be Overlooked in
Caton Investigation.
Accountants Receive $25 a Day
in Topeka.
A clause included in the contract for
an audit of the Topeka Street railway
and the Edison Light company books
provides that the J. E. Caton Auditing
Arm. with which the contract was
made, may examine the daily trip slips
of the railway conductors if so author
ized by the city. W. H. Wasson,
finance commissioner, said he had not
yet authorized the examination of the
slips, but said he and the auditing
company might find another way of
getting the information about that
particular part or tne company s reve
nue, thereby saving $350.
The audit of the McKinley books
began Monday and is well under way.
H. B. Swanson, head accountant of the
Caton firm, is in charge. The books
of the two firms here will be audited
for a period of six years, from Decem
ber SI, 1909, to December 31, 1915.
The maximum cost will be $1,835.
The contract provides for two ac
countants to work on the boks, one to
receive J15 a day and the other $10 a
day.
May Lessen the Cost.
However, the city hopes to lessen
the maximum cost, but not examining
the daily trip slips of the street rail
way conductors. Mr. Wasson said the
city hopes to find a way to ascertain
the status of the slips without going
over each one separately.
The McKinley audit, primarly, was
demanded by a number of civic clubs
several years ago and has been caus
ing more or less discussion since. It
was brought about by Commissioner
Wasson, who introduced the resolu
tion in a commission meeting several
weeks ago.
The city is to receive, under the
franchise, ten yer cent of 90 per cent
of the net earnings of the two com
panies. The street railway company
obtained its franchise in 1903 and
has not yet paid anything to the city,
claiming there were no net earnings
over the amount used for dividends.
The Edison company received its
franchise in 1905. Last year it paid
the city $2,800.
The audit will determine the amount
of the McKinley Investment here, the
amount of receipts from every depart
ment and source to be shown sepa
rately, the amount of expenditures for
all purposes to be shown separately,
improvements made during the period
of the audit, and the annual net earn
ings of the companies above the 10 per
cent earned on their Investments, as
shown by the books. An examination
of the minute books of each company
relating to their stock and a compari
son of the companies' collections with
their bank accounts, are included in
the contract.
What Examination Will Cover.
An examination of all vouchers or
evidence of payments to or from the
companies is to be made and any ir
regularities reported to the city.
Following is the extent of the exam
ination of the street railway company's
books:
Revenues from transportation.
Revenues from operating ether than
transportation.
Non-operating revenues.
Expenses, ways and structures,
equipment, power, conducting trans
portations, traffic, general and mis
cellaneous. Captal accounts, tangible and in
tangible. Reserve accounts.
Curren tassets.
Prepair acounts.
Capital liabilities.
Mortgage liabilities.
Accrued liabilities.
The investment -f the Edison com
pany before and during the period of
the audit will be reported to the city.
Expenditures are to be obtained direct
irom vouchers, time slips and pay
rolls while all minutes of the board of
directors' meeting and all other meet
ings are to be examined and reported
to the city.

Hilken gave the following statement
of his plans today:
captain Simon Lake, undoubtedly
the pioneer in the design of successful
submarines, and P. G. Hilken, Ameri
can manager of the Ozean Rhederei,
Bremen, are considering the advisa
bility of forming a company to oper
ate, under the American flag, a service
similar to that begun by the Ozean
Rhederei with its submersible freight
er Deutschland. The success of the
trip of the Deutschland and the huge
profits which are already assured the
cost of that vessel being practically
paid by her first voyage lead those
who are planning the new venture to
expect it to prove successful fi
nancially." 5 Times Big as Deutschland.
"The vessels will have a, tonnage of
5,000 and will be five times as large
as Deutschland," Mr. Hilken today
declared. "They will be used entirely
for commercial purposes."

Copenhagen, July 13. German
newspapers assert that eighty sub
marines of the Deutschland class are
now being built and that twenty will
be completed in August.
MORE SWELTER!
Everybody's Doing It, From
Atlantic to Pacific
Week More of It Weather
Man Gives No Hope.
New York, July IS. Seven million
or so sweltered again when at 10
o'clock today promised to be the hot
test of the summer. Shortly before
that hour the mercury touched 83,
with the humidity nearly as high. It
was a sticky suffocating heat, without
a breeze to stir things up.
Hot for a Week Yet.
Washington, July 13. From Maine
to the Rockies and from Virginia and
the Ohio river north, hot weather is
likely to continue for a week or more,
the weather bureau forecast today
said.
Temperatures from 90 to 95 up are
not to be unusual. The south, not
having had time to warm up from
several thundershowers of last week,
will be more comfortable.
The north Atlantic coast heat will
be little drier than for the past two
days.
Kansas Out Tor Sew Keeord.
Kansas City, Mo., July 13. Kansas
and Missouri sweltered in the heat
early today, with indications for a
record for the season before night.
The mercury climbed to 94 yesterday,
this summer's high mark. Kansas is
taking advantage of the clear hot days
to finish the wheat harvest.
Drops 20 Degrees in Texas
Dallas, Tex., July IS. The south
west is revelling today In a cool wave
which succeeded a week of the hottest
weather of the year. A temperature
of 78 was reached here, a drop of
twenty degrees in as many hours.
Temperatures ranging from 80 to 88
were reported at Brownsville, Laredo,
Eagle Pass and other points along the
Rio Grande, where the mercury had
climbed as high as 104 earlier in the
week.
Showers At Omaha.
Omaha, July 13. Showers last night
cooled the atmosphere considerably in
this vicinity, but tUe sun came out

2ND NAVAL POWER
Senator Urges Large Appropri
ation for Marine Defense.
"More Value Than All Diplo
matic Notes Ever Written."
Washington, July 13.- Opening the
fight for the biggest naval appropria
tion bill the United States has known.
$315,826,000, Senator Swanson of Vir
ginia, declared today that only by a
navy second to Great Britain can the
United States maintain the Monroe
doctrine and its rights in the Far East
The only alternatives before the na
tion, he said, were a navy of the
highest efficiency and a "timid and
vascillating" foreign policy. Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts, demanded a
fleet for the Pacific coast as well as
the Atlantic.
"One desperate man with a bomb
could disable the Panama canal for
weeks plenty long enough for all
military needs," he said. "Let us pass
this bill at once. It is big because it
must make up for the stinted appro
priations of the past five or six years.
One bill of this kind is of more value
to permanent peace than all the diplo
matic notes and pacts ever written."
PARALYSIS IN STATE?
Two Cases Undetermined, Reported
From Grant County.
Two probable cases of infantile
paralysis were today reported to the
state board of health from Ingalls,
Grant county. An immediate investi
gation will be made by the state
board. If the victims prove to be suf
fering from the disease, it is probable
they will be taken immediately to the
state medical hospital at Rosedale.
Immediately following the receipt
of messages from Grant, county today.
Dr. S. J. Crumbine, secretary of the
state board of health, sent Dr. A. L.
Skoog of the medical school to Ingalls.
If the analysis of Doctor Skoog show
the children are actually suffering
from infantile paralysis, it is probable
the victims will be taken to Rosedale
state medical hospital. Reports from
Grant county, however, are so meager
that doubt remains in the minds of
board of health officers as to the ex
act nature of the disease.
There has been but one report of
actual infantile paralysis in Kansas
this month. This report came from
Winfield.
HOLD B, V. D. PARADE
Iowa Guards Show Contempt of Gov
ernment Clothing.
Des Moines, la., July 13. To ex
press in fitting terms their contempt
for underclothing issued them by the
federal government, 300 soldiers at
Camp Dodge late last night held a B.
V. D. parade uniformed only in under
clothing which they say are all either
48's or 52's, when many of them are
perfect 363. They marched to the
headquarters of Brigaaler General Al
len, camp commander, bearing ban
ners expressing their sentiments to
ward the new garments.
The men were ordered back to their
tents and an investigation is under
way. I, was announced today that
the four troops of Iowa cavalry will
not be mustered into the federal ser
vice because recruits are hard to get
since the Mexican war situation quiet
ed down.

It is probable the state will imme

has been issued, but Charles I. Mar
tin, adjutant general, admitted today
that the plan was being considered.
General Martin spent Wednesday in
Fort Riley in conference with army
officers. The plan for a military
training school at Fort Riley has been
carefully considered and it is probable
the plan will be adopted immediately.
General Martin declined to discuss
the matter today further than to ad
mit that the plan was under consid
eration. Sent to Border.
With a training school at Fort Riley,
newly recruited guardsmen will be
sent at once to the fort. There they
will undergo a course of military
training. As soon as this course is
completed the men will be equipped
and sent to the Mexican border to Join
the First or Second regiment. The
men enlisted will be placed at the dis
posal of the federal government in
filling ranks of the two Kansas regi
ments to full war strength.
"The plan to make Fort Riley a mil
itary training school is being consid
ered," said General Martin, "but no
orders have been issued. The plan
would mean that newly enlisted men
would be sent to the fort until they
were trained and fully equipped for
service on the border."
Governor Capper and General Mar
tin were in conference today concern
ing methods of handling newly enlist
ed guardsmen. Following the con
ference the governor announced the
appointment of Alender Smith of
Hutchinson as second lieutenant of the
Second infantry. The appointment
Wris made on recommendation by Gen
eral Martin.

Neutrals Paying Almost
Much as Belligerents.
as
Washington, July IS. War's in
crease of food prices in Europe as
shown today by the bureau of labor
statistics has touched neutrals almost
as heavily as it has the belligerents.
The Teutonic countries have felt the
pinch more than have the allies.
The bureau's statistics give the big
gest food price advance in Austria,
where meats are more than E00 per
cent higher than before the outbreak
of hostilities. Beef that in February,
1914, sold for 6.S cents a pound, now
brings 38.7 cents. Prices in Berlin
show increases ranging from 45 to
160 per cent.
The British public is paying on an
average 55 per cent more for its food
than it did two years ago. The great
est Increase. 152 per cent, has been in
sugar; the lowest, 17 per sent, in oleo
margarine. In France prices are 23
per cent above the pre-war average;
in Italy around 30 per cent.
Price increases in the neutral coun
tries are shown to be high. In Nor
way twenty-nine necessities are sold
at an average of 63 per cent more than
in 1914. Copenhagen workmen pay
34 per cent more for table articles
than two years ago; in Sweden prices
are 21 per cent higher; in Switzer
land the range is from 3 per cent to
170.

MAKE THEM WORK
The New Plan for Dealing With
the I. W. W.
Agitators Will Be Arrested on
Charges of Vagrancy.
TO BE PUNISHED BY FINES
Payment Will Be Made by La
bor on Highways.
Necessary Machinery Already
Is in Existence.
There is sorrow ahead for the I. W.
W. Members of the organization
commonly known as the "I Won't
Work" crowd must help build high
ways or not stop when they reach
Kansas. Under a decision which Gov
ernor Capper today obtained from the
attorney general's office, I. W. W.
members who loiter in this state may
face vagrancy and other charges and
find jobs on municipal and county
road building gangs.
In an effort to solve the I. W. W
troubles which have caused much
worrv for farmers in the western sec
tion 'of the state, a plan was today
worked out which means real labor for
agitators. The plan is very simple.
It means that members of the labor
gangs may be arrested for disturbing
the peace or for vagrancy. A simple
fine will send these men to Jail and
the court may then order them to
work on the highways until their fines
are paid
The plan as outlined today will not
mt-an lail sentences for the I. W. W.
leaders. It will mean only fines. When
a man is sentenced to jail, there is
difficulty in compelling him to work
out his sentence. But there is no ques
tion as to the ability of a municipal
court's flr justice of the peace's com
pelling a man to crack rock or build
roads in payment of his fine.
On Vagrancy Charges.
Under the law as interpreted by S.
N. Hawkes, assistant attorney general,
cities may arrest the I. W. W. men
on vagrancy charges. The court may
then impose fines and the men may
be compelled to work on the rtreets.
In the rural districts when the I. W.
W. organisers make a demonstration
against harvesters or wheat producers,
the men may be arrested for disturb
ing the peace. The same procedure as
in the city applies and the men may
be sent to work on the county high
ways. When an officer is ir.tirr.idated
or threatened, there is another fine.
All of which means sorrow and dis
tress to t he "I Won't Work" crowd.
t ia ,k0ki. tn.t Rncmnr Conner
will urge the immediate- adoption of
the plan as outlined by the attorney
general's office. The plan is expected
fo mt the -it,. Hon which has re-
cently faced the people in a number of j
western Kansas towns and counties, i
Appeals have been sent to the gov-1
ernor from a number of these towns, j
One came today from McPherson. t
"If these men are made to work, !
KansaB will not be such a lure to
them," said the governor. "Above all
they do not want to work. They are
disturbers and in a number of com
munities have intimidated people and
destroyed property. As soon as a few
hundred of these men can be em
ployed without pay on rock piles and
in road building. I think the I. W. W.
will look elsewhere for comfort and
the agitators will keep moving."
