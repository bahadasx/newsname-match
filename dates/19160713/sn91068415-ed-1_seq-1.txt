few cratches and a slight bruise or
two were the extent ofte injuries.
Brooks receiving the blunt of the
battle. From the evidence a dispute
arose over an account and words
were passed when Armfield invited
Brooks out. Then Brooks
said )
something friend Frank did not like
and they clinched immediately, at
least Armfield went straight after
him. Brooks put up a $19 bond
and failed to show up at court while
at the trial, Armfield was let off
with $5.00 and the costs, or equal
to the amount of the bond Brooks
forfeited.

Commendable Step.
Right thinking people will applaud
the Leonard-Beavans-Stamey Co. for
deciding to close its doors every
Friday afternoon during the hot
months in order to give its force
a breaming spell, inis step on tne
part of this Co. shows that it thinks
of something else besides dollars and
cents and we belive the people will
commend them for it and when
possible give them even more of
their business for giving a half holi

Other stores would do well to fol

ECLIPSE OF MOON AND SUN IS
DUE DURING MONTH.
7
North Carolinians interest in so
lar and lunar topics . will be inter
ested to learn that there will be an
interesting partial eclipse of the
moon on the night of July 14-15,
about 80 per cent of the moon's
surface being covered by the earth's
shadow- It should be observed in
High Point, weather . permitting,
about 9 30 o'clock on Friday night.
When the shadow commences, 'and
lasts until midnight.
An eclipse of the moon can only
occur at full moon, or at "opposi
tion," it is termed; that is, when the
moon in its orbit about the earth is
on opposite of the earth to the sun,
all three bodies being in the line
the moon, the earth and the sun
the moon passing through the
earth's shadow. As the earth's
shadow at the point through which
the moon passes is nearly, three
times the diameter of the moon, it
will be seen a total eclipse may oc
cur when these bodies are not inex
act ftllignment. The length of the
earth's shadow is approximately
857,000 miles and that of the moon
232,000 miles.
The eclipse of the sun will occur
on July 29 and will be what is term
ed "annular" that is, the position of
the sun and moon at the time of the
eclipse will be in such relation to the
earth, the sun being at its nearest
point and the moon at its most dis
tant, that the moon will not cover
the sun's disc, a nan ow rim of sun
light showing entirely around the
moon. When these relative condi
tions are reversed we can have a
total eclipse.
