Directors of the Commercial Boos

Box Elder Commercial Club, Tuesday
night when an Invitation was accept
ed to visit Ilrlgham dtp and to ex
change Ideas on cooperation and clo
ser affiliation of the two clubs In the
futuro than In the past.
That Brlgham City hns some of the
Uvcst boosters In -Utah, there Is no
question In the minds of those wiia
made tho trip from Logan. Tne
Commercial Club headquarters nrc
among tho best In the state. At Brig-
H ham City the Logan party which
U went In automobiles, was met by
B President J. P. Merrill and Score-
H tary Lcroy B. Young, and members
M of tho directors of tho Brlglmm City
I club.
At once all went to the club rooms
ana wero-snown around, and a hand
jfl chalw took place. Introductions were
M mado and at once a genial good
J spirit prevailed. After tho Indul
M genco of several bottles qt Ico cold
M sodu water manufactured at Brlgham
City, tha members of tho party spent
a short time playing onrds, pool and
partook of rruit which had been pro
B vldcd, including strawberries cherries
H and apricots from the Brlgham orch
I ards which are noted for the delict-
ousness of their fruits.
A little later a meeting wag called
M over which President Merrllt presld-
ed. Musical numbers were rendered
M by Lawrenco-Jorgons.cn, Ed Lee and
V Mrs. Heat on. Short booster talks
m were made by tho presiding officer;

flj Cache Valloy Banking Company; Dr.
flj Ccorgo Thomas of the U. A. C. and
J Winn L. Eddy of Brlgham. All gave
J short but enthusiastic talks along tho
J line of get together and pull togoth-
flj er for better communities and for a
fl bigger nnd better Utah.
H Following tho meeting, at tho re-
H quest of Mrs. Grant, manager or tho
Booth Hotel, all went to the hotel i
H where ice cream and cuke-together
Bj with cigars were served free to the
J Logan boosters and ever) one left the
place with a feeling that if the op-
m portunity ever afforded Itself, that
H they would certainly reciprocate to
the management of tho hotel for Its
generosity. The Logan boosters ex
B pect within tho very near future to
H luive the Brlgham City pooplo here

JOS. QUINNEY JR."
IS HOME FROM
HIS LONG TRIP
Joseph Qulnnoy Jr., Is homo again
from his trip to Hussla where he wont
in the Interests of the Utnh-Idaho Su
gar Company and the Amalgamated
Sugar Company to Investigate the
beet sugar Industry and to purchase
sugar beyt seed for tl'ese two Utah
concerns.
The trip, according to 5:r. Quln
noy, was a most successful one from
various standpoints. In the first
place, enough seed was purchnsed to
supply these two companies for ut
least three"years.
Tho trip also furnished valuable in
formation regarding the production
of sugar in foreign countries. "It can
be said that Russia Is one ot the great
sugar beet producing countries of tho
world," remarked Mr, .QulnneyJost
evening! Sfncs his return to Utah
ho" has "been out of town practically
all the time, and It has been hard
to get n report. on Jils trip.
"- When asked about where he vis
ited while away, Mr. Qulnnoy said:
"After leaving our free American
soil, I went to Scotland, then visited
In tho Scandinavian countries. From
hero I went Into tho southern part
of Russia where I mado tho purch
ase of sugar beet seed. Before re
turning I wpnt to Siberia, China, Jap
an anil Hawaii and then to San Fran
cisco.' It was a great experience for
mo. I left without much notice ear
ly In February and was gone about
five months.- The European countries
are making great, demands on our
American mado g6ods. At tho pres
ent time Russia Is assembling 52,000
American made cars to be used In
carrying on traffic on the steam rail
roads of that country."
Mr. Quinney Is receiving hearty
hand shakes on every Bldo by friends
who are glad to welcome, him bo"10
again. They have had Ins Interests
at heart ever since he left Utah and
aro pleased that ho' Is with us again,
and happy to know that hts trip was
so successful as to bring the hearty
approval of tho Interests which em
ployed him to mako so perilous a
trip, for It. was Indeed perilous dur
ing tho great struggle which Is going
on' among tho European nations" at
tho present time. I

GETS RETURNS
ONJHIPMENT
j Th'o following newspaper clipping
.has been handed to our represents
the: Rolntho to the trial cnlrment of
alx tons of gold oro from (ha Lyna
Bin Six proporty, .orated -.it Ooldvlllo
nlmut twenty miles noitiitnsi of Cir
lm, Nevada, In the northeast corn.i
o' Eureka county nnd In tho Lynn
mining district, the following state
ment Is being sent to stockholders bv
President and Manager Ilfnry 'Hark
it and H . V. Van IVlt, viae presl
lont and auditor;
Tho trial shipment of six tons from
tho east vein has been rarapled by
tin- Utah Sampling com pan, and from
tho sampling threo nsa3 havo been
made, tho lowest of which show.s
above $152 In gold io the Ion A car
will bo shipped the comtinj weok, of
oro of apiraitntlytlui m,,c, or even
better grade.
These shipments can bo contlnuod
for a long time, as tho ore scorns to
Improve In quantity nnd quality as
tho east vein Is being developed. For
some wecki tho company 1ms boon
sacking or getting out oro for sack
ing and. with our Present forcn can
till ninety sacks per day. Wo ship
about 1000 sacks to tho car.
The vein Is exposed near the sur
face at Intervals by open cuts for
about COO feet on tho strike and It
seems to bo equally good grade tlie
ontlro length. This Information may
he startling news and you may be
better satisfied If you visited, the
mine iu person. You are urged to
do so.
Wo have nothing new to report ob
the.wost vein. So far it appears to
be a vein of milling ore running about
$30 to tho ton. Tho west vein 1
ready for the mill, which we hoe
to hnvo In operation without unnec
essary delay. The vein Is of verr
largo proportions.
The sacking Is mostly rrom the
high grado portion of tho east vein.
Tho vein Is tbout fifteen to twenty
inches wldo and assays generally
much better than $200, the vein Itself
being about four feet wide and thut
portion outside of the very rich
streak assays $46 to the ton..
It Is possible that tho sacking; la
ter on will bo from the entire width
of tho vein and, while the smelter
returns per car will be less, probably
about $100 to the ton economical me
thods of mining may recommend such
n course.
