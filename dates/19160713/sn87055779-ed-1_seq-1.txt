War or Exclusion of U. S- From

Through Russo-Jap Treaty
ly W S. Son. James Hamilton Ixxxis.
(Written for the International News
Service.
iDternntbui News Servbe:
WASHIN(;T()N. July 13. My in
terest in the Russo-Japanese pact
was aroused as I studied the ques
tion for the last year. My suspic
ions of the objects and purposes
were awakened when I noted that
France ;ind Kngland, within one
certain week. consummated their
prearations to monopolize the trade
( pportunities of Europe and tender
ed to the world their suggestions
which brought all the? present allies
of France and Kngland into a trade
understanding as against all other
countries. At the same time, and
v ithin the same w eek there dev elop
ed on the other side of the world, in
Asia, by Japan and Russia, a. treaty
arrangement that gave to Japan and
Ri'ssia the control of Asiatic tra
and the Asiatic privileges of public
aTairs as against all other countries.
.-tl In Concvrt.
It will be noted that France and
l'n-'land consummated their object
(ooperating with their European al
lies, at the same time their Asiatic
allies Japan and Russia consum
i: a ted their understanding. There
fore. It is also noted that at the time
Japan and Russia effected their un
derstanding their European allies
adopted a similar process. All or
this showing; that loth actions in
each hemisphere was at the instance
and direction of the other. These
matters have been under consider
ation for a year. When they cam
forth they brought with them smiliar
import from Asi.t and Kurop. toth
m common operating ag.rinst inter
ests of the Fnited spates.
The whole tariff question is as
new for the future as it was after
the revolutionary, war. All the past
is broken up. New formations must
be made. Certain raw material of
the world must come into America
for America to make up that raw
material into the manufactured
oods. to be sold to The world.

by the European war. from being
drowned out of existence by the
deluge of cheap foreign manufactur
ed goods. If the arrangement of
Europe and Asia is to eliminate Ger
many and the Teutonic people from
any participation in the world's
commercial affairs and likewise the
Fnited States, this would force the
Fnited States to be confined to North
and South America, or to retaliate
against this course and to he met by
these European and Asiatic coun
tries by opposition to the retaliation,
carrying" that opposition to the ex
tent that Mich is visually carried
w ar.
We are naming a tariff commis
sion for the purpose of dealing with
these questions equitably with all
people and all countries. These ar-
langetnents by Japan and Russia,
France and England, each to con
trol the sphere in which they exist,
would make the tariff commission of
the Fnited States ineffectual, and
would serve to bottle th Fnited
States in the western hemisphere,
and confine us within the bounds of
the Atlantic and Pacific. the St.
Lawrence and the Panama canal
practically shutting us out of the
world and take us from our "place
in the sun."
Policy of Retaliation.
I believe that the Japan-Russian
policy is in retailiation for our ex
cluding these Asiatics and hecause
of certain provisions of our immigra
tion 'ill. Put as these Asiatic coun
tries have the privilege of excluding
people if they choose they must not
he allowed to exclude our goods and
deny us commercial pri ilexes in
tl e world withuut giving us a hear
ing and without allowing us first to
set forth our protest. declare our
lights and seek to have them recog
nized l.y peaceful and statesman-like
net hods.
Therefore, my resolution was to
give notice that the United States
should busy itself to negotiate with
all of these foreign countries named
to have its rights preserved, the
doors of the world's commerce
opened and the privilege of competi
tion upon the seas and the land af
forded America upon the merits of
its goods? and the honor of iU pc-
i Me.

As a result, under the direction of

to direct the government's end of
the campiiffn.
"We are in this hgrht to a linish,"
declared Dr. Hücker. "And we aro

ought to be made clear to the people
by Mie newspapers. There is abso
lutely no cause for a panic. Ileal

"We can only take sensible pre

important to keep clean. There is
no need to go to ridiculous extreme.
Keep Cool is Advice.
"The one "bis thing I wish all

cool-headed. You will always fin-d
that in such a case as this there will
be a reaction.

that children in these summer day?

There is reason in all thinps. In

"This government and all the fa

without saying. Iet the people do
