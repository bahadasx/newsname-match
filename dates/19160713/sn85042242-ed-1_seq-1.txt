"^Owner's Demise.
Minneapolis, July 12.—M. W. Sav­
age, owner of the International Stock

sons who have had and perfected a
homestead entry, the United States
Land Office at Bismarck has received
homestead applications embracing
9,544.58 acres, and aggregating filing
fees of $6,111.40. A considerable por­

a successful two days| session with
a pleasing banquet last even­

the feed proved a fitting finale for a
meeting which everyone in attend­

The attendance throughout the two
days was unusually good, in view of
the fact that this is the busy season
for the telephone companies. All of
the papers and talks showed careful

followed each one Indicated that the
hearers were attentive.
Welfare Work For Operators.
Miss Mae Tyrrell, chief operator at
Fargo, opened the morning session
yesterday with a paper on "The Ne­

what is being done by the larger ex­

social diversions of their operators
pleasant and wholesome. The result
is better operators, stated Miss Tyr­

pays big dividends in improved serv­

General Bliss.
Washington, July 12.—Informal ne­
gotiations for the settlement of bor­
der disputes. between the United
States and the de facto government
of Mexico are "progressing favor­
ably," Acting Secretary Polk said to­
day, after his second conference with
Blisio Arredondo, Mexican ambassa­
dor-designate.
Although Mr. Polk would not add
to this statement, it is understood
that it now is assured the steps tak­
en foreshadow appointment of com­
missioners by each government to
fomulate a plan of action for the per­
manent relief of border conditions.
Guards Instructions.
•Mr. Arredondo has not disclosed
what his instructions are, but from
other sources it has been learned that
the commission plan was favored by
General Carranza and his advisers
and would not foe opposed at the state
department. A formal announcement
is expected soon.
Whether the question submitted to
the commission will follow the defi­
nition of the matters in dispute, laid
down in General Carranza's latest
note is not known, although Secretary*

tipn. The Mexican note said the rea­
sonable anxiety of the United States
on the one hand over the security of
its border and the feeling of the de
facto government on the other, that
the continued presence of American
troops in Mexico menaced friendly
relations, constituted the problem to
which a solution must be fund.
Go Into Details.
There are no present indications
that a commission would go into ques­
tions dependent upon these main is­
sues, but not directly involved in a
settlement. It is believed probable,
however, that the whole subject of in­
ternal conditions in Mexico, including
the financial stress there, would be
reviewed to some extent with the pos­
sible result of some far-reaching plan
being proposed other than the one
embracing border conditions only.

Companies on Good Terms.
Mr. Shuman brought out the inter­
esting fact that there is closer, more
constructive co-operation between the
various individual telephone compan­
ies in North Dakota than is to be
found in any other state. Messages
are promptly relayed to their final
destination, even though they must
be transferred by three or more dif­
ferent companies. There is no unfair
competition of a nature which may
be detrimental to service. The com­
panies are united in their effort to
satisfactorily handle the public's busi­
ness, and the interchange of courte­
sies means satisfaction to the sub­
scriber.
The remainder of the morning ses­
sion was taken up by a question box,
conducted by Mr. Core. In the after­
noon Henry Wilson of New Rockford,
president of the North Dakota Tele­
phone association, opened the pro­
gram by expressing the appreciation
of the association for the good work
which the committee is doing.

DEFENSE MAKES
BITTER ATTACK
Waukegan, III. July 12—Two more
summing up speeches remained to be
made in the trial of Wm. H. Orpet,
collegian, charged with the murder of
'Marian Lambert.
Ralph F. Potter, of the defense
counsel, who spoke''this afternoon,
will finish tomorrow forenoon. Ho
will be followed by James H. Wilker
son, also for the defense, and David
R. Joslyn, for the state, will say the
final word to the jury except for the
judge's instructions. This program
is expected to ('online the case to the
jury Saturday night.
The conclusion of the address of
States Attorney Ralph J. Dady, who
began yesterday, occupied the fore­
noon. Mr. Potter followed.
Mr. Potter's efforts were the first
detailed summary of the interpreta­
tion of the defense of the nicely bal­
anced bit of circumstance which com­
posed the case. He was very bitter
in scoring Dr. Ralph W. Webster, the
state's toxicologist, who swore on an
incomplete analysis that cyanide of
sodium was cyanide of potassium, and
in his criticism of alleged unethical
conduct on the part of Mr. Joslyn. He
denied Mr. Dady's assertions that, the
circumstances in the case must not
be taken as separate instances, but
as a sequence of instances—the pic­
ture as a whole.
"The law presumes a defendant in­
nocent," said Air. Potter, "but for pur­
poses of 'Mr. Dady's sequence the jury
is asked to disregard the law and pre­
sume him guilty."

Much Discord at Camp Lincoln
Because of Second Physical
Examination
REGULAR ARMY OFFICERS
DO NOT UNDERSTAND
Militiamen Qhafe Und$r What
v..
They Claim Are Unreasonalbe
Regulations.
No orders Were received yes­
terday at Camp Lincoln to en­
train. The sleeping cars and oth­
er rolling stock are still on track
here.
The harmony which reigned in the
early days at Camp Lincoln, where
the First regiment is encamped, has
been replaced by discord, due, it is
said, to the inability of the new regu­
lar army officers assigned to North
Dakota's troops to rise to the situa­
tion.
Bitter denunciation of the govern­
ment's moves has been on the tongue
of practically every man since Major
Tyler, tlje first mustering office of the
war department, was ordered to the
border, and his place taken by Cap­
tain C. Stacy. Since then the camp
has been in hot water continually
and there has been no co-ordination
between the federal authorities and
the militia.
Two Physical Earn (nations.*
The second physical examination,
which has caused many men to be
discharged, has come in for consider
cpnsure. First, the men were exam-
by the federal army doctors under
orders that no notations should be
made, the men simiply passing or be­
ing disqualified. This examination
was not any more than completed
than orders were received for a re­
examination in which notations were
to be made.
ilq this second examination many
men fell by the wayside, from 10 to
20 per cent in most of the companies.
This hit some of the militiamen pret­
ty hard, because, having passed the
first examination, they had complet­
ed arrangements to leave home and
had given up remunerative jobs.
Three Pounds Shy—Out.
Most of the disqualifications were
for being under weight, many being
discharged when they were within
two or three pounds of requirements.
The boys had been in camp for about
two weeks, the food was new to them,
they were drilling hard seven to ten
hours a day, quite a few were home­
sick—easily during that period many
could have lost from two to ten
pounds.
The big mistake of the war depart­
ment, believe the militiamen, was not
to allow Capt Turner, assigned to
the militia as instructor, and well ac­
quainted with the regiment, to re­
main here as mustering officer in-

The chance of being sent to a wat­
ery grave by a Bhell from an enemy
craft or of dying in a submarine
caught in an enemy net are the only
dangers of life in a submersible.
Men on submarines face the dan­
ger from tuberculosis and pneumonia.
The chances for death, from many
causes is so great naval officials of
most governments warn men who are
married or have other dependents
not to take positions on submersible
boats.
The interior of a submarine sweats
like a pitcher of ice water. After a
man is inside a submarine an hour
his clothes are wet all the way
through. The men wear as many
clothes as possible and sometimes
put on life preservers for extra
warmth.
During raids in the European war,
when submersibles were compelled to
stay under water long periods, sail­
ors have been known to lose much
weight, 20 pounds in some cases. The
weakened condition of the men
brings on tuberculosis.
Physicians say men on submarines
never really sleep, but merely lapse
from exhaustion into a state of semi­
consciousness for several hours. It
is said bad air, the smell of machin­
ery, the vibration and the strain
make natural sleep impossible.

STATE DEPARTMENT HAS
NOT MADE RULING IN CASE
Washington, July 12.—Although
state department officials virtually
convinced that the German submar­
ine, Deutschland, is strictly a mer­
chant vessel, the advice of the neu­
trality board probably will be sought
before a final ruling is made.
Acting Secretary Polk indicated to­
day that the ruling would not be de­
layed long. It may be announced to­
morrow. It is understood he consid­
ers that there is nothing lacking to
establish the Deutschland's status as
a (peaceful merchantman and desires
to consult the neutrality board in or­
der to give added weight to the de­
partment's formal decision.

Port Ryan, at Baltimore, holding that
the submarine could not be convert­
ed into a war vessel without "exten­
sive structural changes," was for

LIFE ON A SUBMARINEobtainedshe
MEN ROBBED OF FRESH AIR AND NATURAL SLEEP FACE
DANGER OF TUBERCULOSIS AND PNEUMONIA WHICH
MAY CAUSE MORE DEATHS THAN ENEMY SHELLS.
Besides these things, men on sub­
marines are liable to what is called
the worst sickness in the world—sub­
marine sea-sickness. The movement
of submersibles in storms is frightful
as the boats are sealed up tight and
the closeness of the air is said to be
enough to cause death.
Few submarines have beds. The
men simply lie down where they can.
There cannot be any cooking on
submarines and the men live mainly
on biscuits and canned meats.
The sailbrs are compelled be
economical with water when down
low in enemy territory, although
there are thousands of gallons of wat­
er all around them. In enemy terri'
tory the boats cannot go to the sur­
face to take on water.
There cannot be any artificial heat
in a submarine so the interior of the
boat is always the temperature of
the water or air outside. If the wat­
er or air outside is around zero, the
men on the submarine live in lero
atmosphere.
The sailors are not allowed to
smoke.
Some experts say that in war
where submarines are compelled to
go on raids into enemy territory and
stay under water long periods, tuber
culosis' will cause more deaths thaa
the enemy. ..
