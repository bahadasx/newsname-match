LIVING COST
WENTDOWNWARD
Shows Decrease for First
Time Since the Year
1911.
Washington, July 18.—The cost of
living, after rising steadily since
1907, exoept In 1911,' took a.down
ward trend during 1915. A report by
the bureau of labor, issued yesterday,
analysing retail pricea during 1915,
averaged one per cent lower than In
1914. Meats, lard and eggs averaged
from one to nine per cent lower,
while potatoes were 22 per cent low
er. Wheat flour, commeal: and
granulated sugar were higher than in
1914, flour being 20 per cent and
sugar 11 per cent higher.
Commenting on statements that the
European war is. the dominating in
fluence now, controlling price changes
of a)l commodities the report says:
"It Is true that .retail food prices
Increased greatly after the outbreak
of the war, and it:, seems probable
.that they have.been maintained at. a
higher level ever- since. as. a conse
qUence of the Increased demand
abroad for our foodstuffs,. A study of
the retail prices statistics of the
bureau, however, will convince any
one that with the exception of sugar,
flour and possibly cornmeal, the prices
of the principal articles of food since
October,-1914, have been mainly gov
erned by. local and aeMonal conditions
and not by the extraordinary exigen
cies, brought about by the war.
-"The price'of sugar shot up 53 per

and David R. Joslyn, special prose
cutor assisting.the state.
Potter's Address.
"They say Orpet is guilty because
lie ran away' from the body and be
cause he told lies. He did both,, but
let me tell you, gentlemen,. that- the
man who had calculated a murder
never would have' ran. He would
have appeared promptly with the cry
'Marion had committed suicide.' A
fid
he lied, gentlemen, nine of ten boys
would have. lied when afraid. of.' a
whipping.
"And look at the place they say he
selected for his murder—a .spot, easily
visible from the railroad station
where trains were constantly passing
and- passengers gathering, and from
Sheridan road, and on almoet the
highest spot of ground in the: woods
with its leafless, scattered. treea.'
"That dark heavy overcoat he bor
rowed to go tea' party and- wore- to
Lake Forest has been called a dis
guise. How sinister! But you. know
why your brother or your son would
have worn it, don't you? Simply be
cause it 'was warmer than his own
light spring overcoat.'"
Suicide Motives.
A review of the motives which
Marlon' might have had for suicide
and her remarks on unhappiness wta

character of--the German submarine
Deutschland were the subject of a
long conference at the state depart

Polk and members of the govern
ments neutrality board, called in to
give information and informal advise.
The department's final decision on
the status of the submarine probably
will be announced after tomorrow's
cabinet meeting.
Baltimore, July 18.—The unloading
of the cargo of the German super sub.
marine "Deutschland" was completed
early today, and the ship's rise re
vealed that the estimate of its size
had been exaggerated. Instead of
being more than 800 feet long and
with a 80 foot beam, the length is
not more than 260 feet, and the width
less than 26 feet.
Over-all draft, figured when sub
merged, shows that it needs at least
82 feet for complete submergence.
The crew of the "Deutsohland" have
decided to turn over to the Red Cross
fund the $10,000 gift for valor from a
New Yorker.

too much from the voyage of the

That a vessel would be able to forc«

furthermore, Great Britain will not
be able to do much against such
transport service in the future, but it
is too much to expect that the British
blockade of Germany will be ended
by this means."
Other Problems.
Washington. July 13. Other
troublesome questions probably will
arise from the visit of the Deutsch
land, officials realize, but they will be
considered as they develop. The
State department today formally
denied published reports that it would
not be concerned if the Deutschland
should be attacked and s.unk in viola
tion of international law by hostile
warships after leaving the United
States. It was stated that this gov
ernment is interested in all matters
affecting conduct of war and methods
if reprisals by any of the belligerants,
even. though no American citizens
should be immediately involved.
Consul Queried.
Interest in reports that other Ger
man merchant submarines may visit
the United States was indicated by a
dispatch sent by the department to
day to the American consul at
Bremen, inquiring why he did not
confidentially advise the Washington
government of the sailing of the
Deutschland.

No Infantry Fights.
Paris, July 13.—No Infantry fight
ing of Importance occurred last night
on the Verdun front, or over the por

French, today's official report says.
Intermittent artillery engagements
occurred In the Soome sector. In the
vicinity, of Souvllle, Chenols, and La
Ia.ufe and before Verdun a. hMvy
bombardment was maintained by the
Germans. In Champagne French
penetrated a salient of the. German
front and took prisoners. Two Ger

stopped by Frenoh fire.
Attacks Repulsed.
The British comander telle also of
the repulse of two heavy German at
tacks against Contalmaieon and of
"teady progress by his forces in the
Trones wood, the scene, of much
heavy and desperate fighting during
the past few days. Incidentally Gen
eral Halg comments on the heavy
casualties sustained by the Germans
in their attacks against the British
forces north of the Somme.
Steady Advance.
From General Halg's bulletins it is
seen that the British are driving
steadily towards the crest of the ridge
commanding the wide Blpaume
plateau. According to the view of
French military experts there are no
less than 600,000 German bayonets
opposing the advance of General
Haig's forces.
Ancient Guns.
The Reuter. corespondent at the
British front reports that two German
field guns bearing the date IS74 have
been captured by the British. The
correspondent asks whether, without
attaching undue Importance to the in
cident, if these guns do not indicate
the straits to which the. Germans are
beginning to be reduced in order to
find sufficient armament.
Russian Front.
On the Russian front the battle
Continues along the Stokhod river

PROHnUDE
BY U.S. CONSUL

Washington, July 13.—Vigorous
protest has been made by the Unit

against the action of the governor
general of Syria in breaking into the
French and British consulates at
Beirut and carrying off their archives
after the American consul general
there had placed the seal of the Unit
ed States on. their doors.
It became known here that many
prominent Syrians recently executed
by the Turks were condemned because
their names appeared. in papers taken
from the violated consulates. Accord*
ing to official information, the mere
presence of the nsmes In the consular
records served as a death warrant,
without further proof of antagonism
to the Turkish government.
The American consul general W.

his relations with tlie local authorities
at Beirut by his activities In behalf
of the citisens of allied countries left
