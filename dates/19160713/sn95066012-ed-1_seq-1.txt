PROTEST MADE TO TURKEY
United States Objects to Seizure of
Archives Scaled by American Consul
Washington, July 18. Vigorous pro
le i has been made by the United
States to the Turkish government
against the action cf the governor
general of Syria in breaking Into the
French and British consulates at
Beirut ami carrying off their archives
after the American consul-general
there had placed the seal of the I'nit
ed States ou their doors. It became
known at Washington yesterday that
many prominent Syrians recently i e
cuted by the Turks were condemned
because their names appeared in pap
ers taken from the violated consulates.
According to official information the
im re presence of tiie names in the con
sulate records served as a death war
rant without further proof of antagon
ism to the Turkish government
The American consul general, W
Stanley llollls, already had strained
iiis relations with the local authorities
at Beirut by his activities in behalf
of the citizens of allied countries left
in his care upon the withdrawal of
the British and French consuls there.
w h n the Turkish governor demanded
access to the consulate papers, Mr.
llollls not only refused It, but a
pealed to the American embassy at
Constantinople, which tiled a formal
remonstrance with the porte. Even
this was unavailing. The papers were
taken ami still are held.
Turkey early in the war renounced
the capitulations to free herself of
restraints imposed by joint Interna
tional treaties and in this ease is al
leged lo have violated a wellc-tah-llshed
principle of international law
which Officials at Washington say
must be maintained whether or not
treaties exist. Little satisfaction has
been obtained from any of the nu
merous protests lodged at Constan
tinople since the war began, but It is
Imped at the -tat,- department that
in this ease punishment of the offend
er may he brought.
