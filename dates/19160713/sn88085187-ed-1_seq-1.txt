he is a candidate for re-elecUon,
the campaign warmed up notire
ably.
A. V. Fawcett, Taconia's may
or, and Johnson's chicf —and per

his forces in a manner that makes
ceriniii the fight will be a -i'al
battle.
Ills official declaration of can

Fawcetfs friends today fired a
big gun in a statement by Or. K.

career and citing arguments why

After the war he studied teleg

on the Chicago & Alton. It was
good business training but ad
vancements came slowly and al
though he was climbing he re

for a hig implement house of Peo

But the west called him.
He came to Tacoma in 1883
and opened an implement and
seed store. He built the great

branches at Portland, Seattle,
North Yaklma and Bellingham.
By 1890 he was worth $500,000.
Then came the panic, and an
other Bide of the man of business

wealth was mostly In notes

Further, he used his ready cash

By Mabel Abbott

1 went to the mayor; liomc. 620 South
E street, very early this morning, to ask
his wife this question.
Being still a newcomer in the city, I
had to hunt for the mayor's house.
And when I found it, I smiled to my
self as I climhed the steps between the
tubs of flowers. Because it was so little
like the traditional abode of a high offic
ial, and so much like the kind of home that
is the background—and the back bone —
of plain, everyday Americanism.
A slender girl in pink glanced shyly at
me from behind a rosebush; two small
boys <>|xriied the door; another pounded
through the house shouting "Mamma!
Ma-ma! Here's a lady!"
A still smaller one inspected me cau
tiously from a safe distance.
And behind them came Mrs. Fawcett,
aproned and busy, and smiling at my
question.
''Why, I suppose it's because I think he
can do something for the people of the
state. He's always been for the people,
and this will be a bigger opportunity,"
she answered me.
Surrounded by children of graduated
sizes, Mrs. Fawcett led the way into her
living-room.
"How many? Only five here," she said
serenely. "Then there's the oldest boy,
that makes six. My little girl comes next

Auto Rule
For Park
Reversed
Any person of persons can
hire an automobile for a trip
to the lUtnirr National park
Milt Mt. I mount.
Kuril »vns the iiilinn i <■-
,- rrl%cd In Ticonu today from
It. It. Mhi-liiill. vii|i.rll.l. n.l
-etit of national parks, <lcpmi
m.ni of the interior.
At first It looked as If the new
park ijrunpßiiy was going to have
a monopoly on all machines that
took folks to the park.
The rule of March 1, which has
been aauglng a good deal of com
plaint was that "the park ii open
to union operated for pleasure,
-but not to those carrying passen
gers who are paying either direct
ly or indirectly for the use of the
machine."
Marshall's new ruling gives the
public a chance to have some
choice of what automobiles It
wants to ride in.
While it prohibits commercial
or. public auto transportation
business or "jitney service" to
the park hy unlicensed parties,
the new rule doesn't prevent per
sons from entering the park in
hired autos, with this proviso:
The person or persons hiring
ths auto annul receive any rake
-6W or compensation from other
Suueengers carried in the ma
thine.
; .The one hiring the machine
#'H| hereafter be regarded aa the
owner of It for the trip and must
acilßfy the officers at the park
t&t the car isn't being used for
pr*flt, either directly or in
directly.
The ruling governs all national
parks.
It doesn't prohibit a number of
folks from clubbing together to
hire an auto.
And on the face of it, It doesn't
prohibit them from employing the
man from whom the oar is hired
as their driver.

Milwaukee officials today
scoffed at Rhodes' story.
"We are not attempting to hold
anyone against IMb will," said one
official at the docks.
"How could we get work out
of an unwilling employe? Any
man working here can quit when
he wants to, and get his pay
whenever he demands it. We
have made no attempt whatever
to hold anybody who did not
want to work."
Rhodes is a picturesque fig

the Philippines and there was
slaxhed In battle by bolos so
severely that he lay 10 months
In a hospital.
While convalescent he chanced
to observe a quarrel between
