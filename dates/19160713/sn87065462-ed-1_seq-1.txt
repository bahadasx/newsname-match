Tue lied Men of North America, In
stead of being a vanishing race, u.-o
really on the increase. Under the cave
of the Federal and State governments,
exercised sometimes, it must be ad
mitted, by selfish and unscrupulous
agents, the race is gradually taking
on education, deserting Its wild, no
madic life, and settling itself to the
serious business of civilized living.
Not least Important of the factors at
vork for the Indians' uplift, and cer
tainly the most fundamental and the
most unselfish, are the home mission
agencies of the various demonstrations
which are earnestly endeavoring to
give to the race a Christian basis for
character and Christians'.staudaids cl
conduct. The transition from the old
life to the new is cxcee-.lingly difficult,
of course, but it is gratifying to note
that great progress has been mad')
and that the Indian's well-known na
tive virtues stand out notably whfn
reinforced by the Christ lau faith.
Some of the religious handicaps am!
attainments of the race are recounted
In a recent address by ltev. W. A.
Petxoldt, for many years a li.pt is',
missionary among the Crows. He Bays:

"The Indian's position is in many
ways pathetic. Hardly out of savagery,
he is expected to compete with a peo
iie wiio have had centuries of devel

patience is needed in dealing with

of the colonial period an Englishman
usked: 'Docs not the red man know
that the pale face loves him?' Yes,
the chief replied, 'we know that you
love the very ground that we walk or..'
"Another handicap, and a serious'
ino is the fact that the government
Las done too much for the Indian and
jot enough with him. He has- been
iven little chance to paddle bis own

public crib have kept him In racial

"But while the Indian has clementa;

Uniformed Officers Already on the
Ground-Policy Still UnceUled
Kews Frcm hiany Lands.
Just before he died General Booth
of the Salvation Army sent this mes
sage to the foreign office of the army:
"Don't forget China. You must send
some one to China." He gave a simi
lar injunction to his son, the present
general.
In order to carry out the wishes of
the commander the Salvation Army
has now sent Colonel Hothwell, with
six or eight pioneer officers, to China.
"It wiil be inteitstinV' Bays the
Christian Intelligencer, "to watch the
outcome of this new and unique invas
ion of China. The Salvation Army
boar.ts its adaptability to all countries
.ind circumstances. The policy to be
pursued in China is still unsettled,
except that the party will wear iho
army uniform. These officers have
one aim however, and that is "to get
fouls and go for the worst." The em
phasis will be placed on direct evan
gelistic effort. There may probably
be a development in the way of rescue
work, in which the army has had great
success in Japan. Either Peking,
Tientsin or Chefoo will be the firsi
battle ground. It is encouraging that
thc:;e soldiers of Christ are equal to
the necessity of the one conquest all
nations should enthusiastically writs
!n, the conquest of the world for
Christ."
Where Christian Kindness Won.
A missionary visiting a home In
China found a very r.ick woman. Both
the woman and her husband were for
eigners but the missionary managed
to make them understand that he
wanted to help them. He persuaded
i hem to go with him to a Christian
doctor. There were no hospital ac
commodations in the town, so the doc
tor opened his own home to these
two strangers in a strange land, and
cared for the st--ij vomai until she
was restored to health. Tho kindness
of the missionary and of the doctor
made a deep impression on the miliar
of the foreigners. The missionary
had given them a Bible in their own
tongue, and they began to read It.
Sunday was a day of revelry and
dancing, but the Bible had made bu h
an impression upon these two that
v,-hen the time came to have a Sunday
party in their home they felt that tie
ruble should be read to the company.
After this they went from house to
house throughout the town asking per
mission to read the Bible in the homau.
As a direct result of their efforts four
teen families were converted.
Japan's Emperor.
Emperor Yoshihito of Japan Is an
nttractive personality, thirty five year,
of age, an accomplished modern prince
greatly beloved by the nation. He has
visited all parts of the empire and Is
well versed in all affairs of the state.
Mis character is said to be exalted and
stainless.
With his reign known as the era of
"great righteousness" began monog
amy. With the old emperor ended
plural marriage In the Imperial house
hold. The present empress, Sadaha,
is said to be a lovely woman. The
crown prince L twelve years old.
In new Japan with her constitution
and codes of laws, plural marriage or
polygamy, is left in the cold and has
no legal standing. "The new court j.is
been brought much nearer to that of
the Christian courts of the world,
(hough for ages it will remain dis
tinctively Japanese.
Conference in Latin America
The movement for the holding of a
congress on Christian work in Latin
America began at the Edinburg con
ference in 1910. The eight com 'is
Moiis making investigations fur tho
Panama congress now have 215 nieia
bers, most of whom have long been
students of Latin America. To date,
over 200 papers have been sent Into
the commissions from more than 600
correspondents.
Practically all the boards intend to
t.end their full quota of delegates to
Panama, and applications for visitors
privileges are being received from
many persons prominent in church
and public life.
Immediately following the Panama
congress groups of strong leaders will
visit direct from Panama, the section

Farmers Excursions to A. & M.
College
Thousands of farmers from all
parts of Mississippi are expected
to visit the Mississippi A. & M,
Collecre during the months of
July and August to study better
farming methods. This will be
made possible by a series of spe
cial farmers' excursion trains
which will be run to the college
from every part of the state for
the benefit of farmers and busi-
ness men who want to develop
abetter system of agriculture,
Beginning July 19th, when the
first of these trains will be run
from Corinth and intermediate
points, these excursions of farm-
ers will be made to the college other words, whenever screen
at intervals of a few days, until . js done ;n fl pIps mannpr
the latter part of August. This
announcement has just been
given out by Director E. R.
Lloyd, of the extension work in
Mississippi, who has just com-
pleted the final arrangements.
These farmers' excursions are
an entirely new idea in the agri-
cultural developement of the
state and excellent results are
expected from the visits of the
farmers to their college and ex-
periment station, where they will
see the better farming methods
in practice. As explained by
Director Lloyd, the excursions
will take the place of the annual
"Farmers' round up" heretofore
held in August. Plans have al-
ready been completed to run four
trains and Director Lloyd hopes
to arrange for two additional
trains making six in all.
In order that the greatest
number of farmers can take ad
vantage of these visits, the col
lege is securing especially low
rates on all railroads' and will
provide accomodations for all
visitors at autual cost of service.
Board and lodging will be not
more than one dollar lor eacn
day. Each trainload of farmers
will stay two days at the college
during which time a full pro
gram of instruction and enter
tainment will be put on.
During the day special live
stock exibitions will be staged
and excursions made to points of
interest about the college farm
and barns. Demonstrations in
terracing, pruning and spraying,
innoculating hogs against chol
era, ana in otner pnases oi im
proved farming will be given for
for the benefit of the visitors
The evening sessions will be be
devoted to instructive lectures
and speeches from the most
prominent agricultural workers
in the state.

How to Screen
(By Dr. W. S. Leathers.)
Much of the screening that is
done is ineffective. An idea
prevails among many people that
screening of doors and windows
of a residence gives all necessary
protection so far as this particu
lar measure is concerned, against
flies and mosquitoes. The door
js Screened often with a prark at
the bottom which admits flies
and mosquitoes freely, or in time
it becomes punctured with holes,
throup-h which rhpv o-ain apss
to the home. In a sense, this
kind of serepnino- ra.isps tho in-
mates of the home to live with a
feeling of false security. In
whether it be a home or a res-
taurant or a hotel, it permits
flies and mosquitoes to enter.
an(i wnen these disease carrvinir
insects once gain 'admittance.
tnis kind of screening prevents
them from escaping from the
house; in other words, it serves
as a "trap" instead of a protec-
tion.
Screening to be effective
should be done with care: no
cracks should be left around the
screPn door or window, even the
smallest opening will be found
DV a blood-sucking mosqueto. or
fiith carrying flv. The wire
LaUse should have sixteen to
eighteen mefehes to the square
jnch. Even a fourteen mesh
wl-re p.ause wjii Enow smaii mos.
quitoes to enter, unless it is
painted; the twelve inch wire
gause should never be used.
This serves to protect against
flies, but not mosquitoes.
During the summer months it
is desirable to have a portion of
the porch screened, as it is usu
ally the custom for all people to
to sit on the porch in the even
ing during the summer months
As malaria is spread by a cer
tain kind of mosquito which us
ually bits only at night, it is
necessary to use special precau
tions between dusk and sunrise.
Every home should be protected
against flies and mosquitoes by
effective screeneng. When peo
pie live without such, protection,
it is shown that they spend more
money in doctors Dills in one
year because of this, than screen
ing costs.
Likewise all restaurants, ho-
ters and meat markets should be
screened carefully, in order to
protect food against the disease
spreading house fly.
On last Monday the "Beulah
Holder" M. S. met with Mrs.
beymour Jones, wno, as our
newly eIected president, presid
ed for her first time, and in her
usual affable mannert gave us an

part in real earnest. Four new
members were received, making
fifteen wide-awake earnest work

This society was organized by
Mrs. J. H. Holder and some of
our brightest young women of
the M. E. church. They are do
ing a grand work. We are glad
to have Mrs. Joe Herndon with
if
us again, tier presence is an

After the delightful refresh

The Printer and Raising Prices.
By Albert M. Freeman.
A butcher came the other day,
One thousand billheads
bought.
I charged him what I always
had,
Nor gave the price thot.
A tailor entered afterwards,
With copy for a dodger,
The price was what he paid last
year,
(I dared not make it larger).
A man who deals in coal and
wood
Was next to try my door,
"Five hundred cards? One
fifty,"
(I never had asked more).
Today I went to pay some bills,
Good grief, I stopped to think,
For all the prices looked so large
On paper, type and ink.
Tonight my wife came 'round
for cash
To pay for meat and coal,
And also for. the children's
clothes
The figures gnawed my soul.
"Thanks, thanks to ye, my
worthy friends,
For the lesson ye have
taught,"
I cried aloud and roundly swore
I'd never more be caught.
Tomorrow when the butcher
comes
He'll pay a price that's higher.
Or else the shade of mighty Ben
May haunt me for a liar.
The American Printer. .
A Boy Worth While
LeFore County has produced
one of the most remarkable boys
in Mississippi, if not in the en
tire South.
His name is Smiley Shipman
and he lives at Itta Bena.
When he attended High school,
young Shipman was a devoted
student, and at the same time he
acquired the habit of looking
out for himself. When he was
a mere lad, he became possessed
of an ambition to acquire an ed
ucation. He attended the high
school in his town, and his spare
time he devoted to small jobs
which he picked up about town
and which would have been
spurned by the average youngs
ter.
But Smiley worked hard men
tally and physical and when he
was fourteen years of age, he
graduated from the high school
and entered "Swaney" Webb's
school at Bell Buckle, Tenn.
His father did1 not furnish the
money to pay his expenses at
Webb's school, because it was
unnecessary. Smiley had saved
enough money which he earned
with his own hands to pay his
way through that institution.
After spending three years in
the Webb school, Smiley entered
Millsaps College, at Jackson,
where he has been three years.
Again did his practice of econo
my and thrift make possible his
entrance to one of the leading
institutions of learning without
the aid of relatives or friends.
Not only has youngs Shipman
made his own way, but he has
assisted in keeping two younger
brothers in college.
This shows what a boy can do
f he really wants an education.
t cost young Shipman a great
deal to turn a deaf ear to the al-
uring demands of society, but
he was willing to pay the price,
and today, when he has. almost
attained his majority he goes
forth in the world, equipped to
fight his own battles and to as
sist others.
This kind of boy is worth
something to his State and the
community in which he lives.
Too often it is the case that the
young men spend the days of
their youth in idleness. When
they should be preparing them
selves for the sterner things
that will confront them in their
future lives, they are negligently
waisting the youth and vigor of
their being in immaterial
pleasures,.
The State of Mississippi owes
a debt to young SmileyJShipman.
He has set an example that
might well be followed by others
and the intelligence which he
has gained in youth will in
future years redound to the be
nefit of his State and the uplift of
his fellowmen, J. G. B. in
