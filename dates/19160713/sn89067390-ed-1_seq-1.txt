Which VoiCt? i
Mr. McCormick. the new Demom-.
tin N.iional Chairman, declares th.n!
The voice of Wilson is the voice of
the naiion and must be sustained."
Let us see.
Never in American have we had
President as nnf table in his views a
the present incunbent. In the last
few years the voice ol Wilson has ''
v
uccii
In favor of and opposed to a single
Piesidertial term. j
In favor and opposed to free Panama
Canal tolls lor American ships.
In favor of and rppos.-d to a tatfl
commission
In favor of and oPDOSi d 0 free sue-.
In favor ol and ODposed to ir.terfti
ing in M xican i fhirs.
In favor of and opposed to making
loans to the belligerent powers in
Europe.
In favor of and opposed to classifying
armed merchant ships as ships of war
Iii favor ol and opposed to i full t x
predion by Confess on the " (
merchant ship q iestion. j
In fav. r ol ami opposed to a large '
tlavv
In favor ol and opposed to a Urge
military prepareo.ii. ss. :
In favor of and opposed to knocking
Bryan into a "Cockd Hat." j
In favor of and opposed to Woman
Suffrage,
In favor of and opposed to cutting
dewn extravagance in Government
affairs.
In favor of and opposed to decreas
ing Ihe number ol Government em
ployes. In favor ol and opposed to union la
bor, the initiative and referendum,
civil service, direct election of Senators
and in favor ol and opposed to every
proposition of importance that has
been before the American public in
the last few years.
When Mr. McCormick declares that
the voice of Wilson is the voice of the
Nation, he should specify which voice,
that "in favor ol" or "opposed "to" a
proposition. " Wilson uses both on all
questions.
"Protection"
"I would secure the American mar
ket to the American Producer, and I
would not hesitate to raise tariff duties
whenever necessary to secure this pa
trotic end. I would not have an idle
man or an idle mill or and idle spindle
in this country if, by holding exclusive
ly the Amercian market we could keep
them employed and running. Every
yard of cloth imported here makes a
demand for one yard less of American
fabrication.
"Let England take care of herself;
let France look after her interest; let
Germany take care of her own people,
but in God's name let Americans look
, after America. Every ton ol steel im
ported diminishes that much of home
production. Every blow struck on the
other side npon an article, ahich
comes here in competition with like
articles produced here makes the de
mand for one blow less at home. Ev
ery day's labor upon the foreign pro
ducts sent to the United States takes
one day's labor from an American work
ing man. I would give the day's la
bor to our own first, last and all the
time, and that policy which fails in
this is opposed to American interests
To secure this is the great purpose of
Protective Tariff."
WILLIAM MCKINLEY.
Rrpub ican Act Averted Panic
It is quite common lor Democratic
speakers and writers to credit the new
Federal Reserre Law with svening a
a panic at the outbreak of the Euro
pean war, thought that law had not yet
gone into effect. Chairman O lie M.
James, of the Democratic National
Convention, is one speaker who over
looked the record. He said:
"What would have been the result
If ihe old R-publican system had been

The following is taken from the An-

The Republicans were not imposing
every conceivable tax, and a handsom
surplus was presented to the Demo
crats which they quickly dumpeP into
the pork barrel.
The Republicans of the various
counties in Missouri and particularly
the close and the comparatively close
counties, should realize that this is a
Republican year and that matters
that lor some years have been hope
less are worth fighting lor now. The
party has a chance to elect its local
tickets in seventy five counties of the
state and portions of them in most of
the rest. The first step is to give the
party the confidence and prestige of a
big primary vote. II the Republican
vote shows up on August 1st larger
than the Democratic, it is going to
spur the party with assurance and cor
respondingly depress the opposition.
In this matter every Republican can
help by going to the primary polls,
voting the Republican primary ticket
and in getting his Republican neigh
bors to do the same. This is a mat
ter ol the utmost importance. Then
see that a good, strong ticket is nomi
nated. Name not only the very best
men' but the very best runners and
and then get behind them and boost
every minute of the day until electi n.
Strong men like Walter S. Dickey are
going to pull the general party vole up
if every body does his duty.
The week ended June 24 recorded
ordets Irom the warring powers lor
500,000 tons of sheet steel (or delivery
this year. Two contracts lor a total
ol 200,000 9 2 inch shells were placed
with domestic shell plants and negoii
itions are now active on contracts lor
500,000 additional shells. The Rus
sian government his tentatively placed
contracts it r 350,000 tons ol rails and
1 000 locomotives. As Russia increas
es her facilities for handling freight
over the Trans- Siberian road, our ex
ports ol war munitioos to Russia in Asia
increase. Our normal exports to Rus
sta ic-Asia are about $1,250,000 an
nnally. During the ten months of the
fiscal year ended April 1916 our ex
ports to this portion cl Russia totaled
$85,000,000. Democratic prosperity.

Not only is the administration forced
to admit that horses and mules ar?

the same acknowlednmrnt as to blank

er our own government is now buying,
these war supplies just as ft reign
countries have oen buying them from

guard was so short of blankets that
cit'zens organiz ld reli f movements
.and colleced blankets lor the guards-
men who had been mobilized for en
listment in th- demonstration against
Mexio. This d reed admission as to
the war-order char: cter ol the trade we
have been erjiying, is rather discon
certing to thi cun,aign managers of
the Wilson administrau in, as their
previous dsniilsire nit only discredit
ed but suspicion is cut up ju all thiir
other political ass -r ions.
Every Senator and C-mgrssnnn
returning Irom a visit home alter the
Nitional Convention brought to Wash-

publican ticket has been everywher-
nihusiis'i:al'v r'-ceied. Fmm Mtin'

"If the Republicans put some vigor
ous work into North Carolina, we can
carry the State in November and make
a gain in the Congressional districts ol
at least two," said a resident of that
state to a group of Congressman at the
Capitol. "I feel quite confident that
Claude Kitchen can be beaten and
that we can carry the district in which
Representative Page (Democra ) lives.
He has declined to be a candidate.

War Helps U. S. Trade In South America
We have been reaping the benefit
of Europe's inability to attend to lor
eign trade while sh has a titanic
quarrel on her hands. To the A. B.
C powers, (Argentina, Brazil and
Chile) which are our principal custom
ers in South America, we sent during
the first ten months of the fiscal year
Piod, under a Democratic tariff lar,
they dropped to 879,500,000; but
riurin ,h(' 1916 Piod they rose to
5103,000,000
The war opened the
way for us.
Despite Secretary Redfield's tall
bracking of our conquest of South
American markets, and the boast ol
Senior Furnifold Simmons of North
Carolina, that "instead of surrendering
our markets to the foreigner, we have
invadfd and captured his," our exports
to all South America for the ten months
ended April, 1916, were only about
820,000,000 in excess of the record
made for the ten months ended April,
191.3, when a Republican tariff law
was on the sta'ute books. During the
ten months eoded April, 1914, with a
i Democratic taritt law in operation, ana
a consequent depression in manufactur
1 v
ing inausines in me unucu oiaics, uui
txport trade to the South American
l-..i.:.,. rn ei07 nnn nnn enm-
pared with over 8122,000,000 for a
H
similar priod ended April, 1913, un
der the Republicai Urifl law.
How shall we retain a lair share of a
trade which the misfortune ol Europe
has placed in our hands? is the ques
tion American producers are asking
themselves, and most ol them arrive at
the answet: "By guaranteeing to the
American manulacturrr adequate pro
tection in his domestic market."
This will keep the mill wheels
humming at top speed, and make pos
sible the lull time ' American standard
9l wages to our laborers. It will re
duce the unit cost ol reduction to a
point which will enable our manu
a:turers to be serious contenders for
tn-S iuih Am-rican markets. With a
uroiectivt '.ar fl oaok ol him. the Amer
?.tn m-nnlacu:rer can fne forth fear
lessly, to have and to hold. With a
Democratic near Irce '.rade tariff law
. ncotuaning If reign competitors to
i rowdiim out ol his own bailiwick his
a-iility to cope wuji those competitors
in South Ann rica will be irretrievably
lost. The Southern Democracy knows
': is. but the Re re sentatives whom
lheSmth sends to Congress do not.
md they hold the balance or power at
pn s nt. Those Southern Representa
tives will continue in control as long
a? the Democra :c party continues in
poer. That is why the producing
classes of Am- rica are in lavor of re
turning the Republican party to con
trol ol National policies. Moreover,
the best way to cemc nt our Iriendship
with the Ldi.i American countries is
t) supply them liberally with products
"Made in America."
The sma'ler the rv. nue derived
from importers bringing goods into the
Uuitil S'ates lo compete with Ameri
can indos'r. and laor, the bigger the
tax which the people ' ol this country
will have to di lr in iheir own pockets
to defray the exp nse ol riinnin the
Givernment. A i i this docs not take
iuto consid r t i -u 'h' ii j iry caused to
our iudus'ii s a. d lanor by a near free
trade tar fl law.
S'.eps are b-in taken by the Aus
tralian farmers tt rnrnoine and posh
their trade with tful Orient sncond ns
ed milk. But wi'h a D -mocratic tariff
law in operation, anrt cnrierisid milii
