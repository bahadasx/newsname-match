SIXTEEN CO. D.
Several Turned Down Owing to Un­
derweight—Members Tell Interest­
ing Camp Life Stories
GET.it-iu :.•*
Sixteen of the members of Co. D.
•who failed to pass the physical exam­
ination, mainly because they were un­
derweight, have returned to Minot.
When the guardsmen were mustered
in as regulars on July 1, they were
E'ven
a rigid examination. Their
ngs, hearing and sight were tested
and their feet and teeth examined.
Three of the boys who were rejected
were later allowed to re-enlist. Among
those who have returned are Frank
Palvey, Joe Selberg, W. H. Hall and
"Whitey" Calkins.
Mr. Hall, who is engaged with City
Engineer TTiomas, kindly gave the In­
dependent an interesting story of his
life in camp at Fort Lincoln. He spoke
highly of the Minot boys in Co. and
says that while they are a little below
standard in drill work, they have the
right kind of fighting stuff in them
and if they ever get into action, they
will give a good account of themselves.
The boys who returned home were
very much disappointed as they very
much desired to go to the front.
The Co. boys who came back were
not mustered out until Saturday noon
after all of the others had been mus­
tered out, consequently they had to re­
main in Bismarck until Monday morn­
ing. They were provided with tickets
back home.
Although an order went into effect
that all married men should be dis­
charged, only three from Co. are in
the lot. They are George Hodge, Paul
White and Mr. Rochelle. They had to
sign an application for discharge on
the grounds that one or more members
of their family were dependent upon
them for support. They will not be
able to get away for about 60 flays
and in the meantime are on their way
south with their company.
Seven of the Co. boys at first re­
fused to sign the muster list and were
placed in the guard house for two or
three days. They did not understand
the new ruling thoroughly and as soon
as they did so they signed freely.
Mr. Hall says that Co. D, which is a
part of the third batallion, expected
to entrain for the south Wednesday.
They are among the last to leave.
There has been a delay that has prov­
en quite discouraging to the boys.
The camp discipline is very strict.
On the Fourth the regiment was tak­
en into Bismarck in box cars and the
soldiers marched about town. They
were brought back in box cars. That
night many of the boys went to Bis­
marck again and spent the evening
marching about the city, singing and
celebrating generally. This was fol­
lowed by an order from the colonel
that no one should leave camp without
a permit. A number who sneaked away
to go swimming, etc., did time in the
guard house.
Mr. Hall talked of the fight which
some of the members of Co. are said
to have engaged in with other mem­
bers of the regiment. It was the re­
sult of some busybody carrying tales
back and forth, saying that Co. had
it in for a certain company and that
the company had it in for Company D.
The result was that there were a few
black eyes on all sides. Hall says this
will make soldiers of them quicker
than anything.
When the rations arrived for the
journey south, they were piled up out­
side the tents. A rain came up and
the boys had a fierce time getting
them under cover. Some of the stuff
got wet. The boys chipped in "four
bits" apiece to buy extras for their
trip south.
The soldiers have been under very
strict discipline. This is considered
necessary and the boys believe that
after they have learned their lessons
well, they will be given more privi­
leges. They are called at 5:20 in the
morning, fall in for roll call, undergo
the setting up examination, police the
grounds and fall in for breakfast.
They eat bacon, spuds, bread and cof­
fee and do not get butter oftener than
once a day. They drill from 7:30 till
10:30 and dine at 12. They drill again
from 2:30 to 4:30 and eat supper at
6. After supper they are on dress pa­
rade or have inspection of arms or
quarters. At 5:30 they have guard
mount. Co. boys were on guard two
nights. The regimental band gives a
concert each evening. Taps blow at
10:30. The boys do not have much
recreation.
The camp is kept sanitary. Each
company has a corporal and five men
for kitchen police duty, who do not
have to drill the day they are on duty.
They keep the fires burning, rustle
the wood, help cook, etc. One fire is
kept burning all the time. They used
cord wood and railroad ties. Each
soldier washes his own dishes. All
refuse is burned in the camp fire. The
boys wash their own clothes and take
a shower bath once a day.
Verne Miller, a member of Co. D, is
a professional hypnotist, having ap­
peared in entertainments in Minot. He
gives occasional performances in the
art and says he will try it on the
Seorge
-{'1
reasers if he ever gets to them.
Hodge and "Tub" Carroll are
also good entertainers. None of the
boys have been very sick but some
have had sore feet from poorly fitting
shoes. Many of the boys shaved their
MBilRMiM»B!ail«i^^
heads. Swede Christianson shaved hi3
head all around, blistered it in the sun
and took cold. His head was swollen
badly for several days. Some of the
boys shaved all the hair off their heads
except a little which formed the let­
ters "Co. D." The Colonel has issued
orders for none of them to do any
more head shaving.
POLITICAL COMMENT
Donnybrook Courier: The complete
success of the Nonpartisan league peo­
ple in nominating their men at the
primary elections is something that
will go down in the history of the
state as a most remarkable event. It
is also something that will put North
Dakota before the eyes of the whole
country as a state where a farmer
movement has been carried through to
a finish without a hitch. The farmers
of this state have found out their
strength and they have demonstrated
their strength to those who may have
been inclined to think that farmers
cannot act together. There will be no
more fun poked at anything the farm­
ers start in this state. And why
should this not be so This is a pure­
ly agricultural state. Anything that
benefits the farmer should benefit the
rest of the people of the state. We
hear it said that the state is going
socialist and is going to the dogs. Aft­
er a while it will be realized that it
makes no difference whether you call
people socialists, republicans or dem­
ocrats. It is the same people. They
are no better and no worse for the
name. There are dangerous individ­
uals in all parties, but the majority in
all parties is made up of good, every­
day citizens. Besides, there were never
enough socialists in North Dakota to
make much of a showing at the polls.
They may have joined in the nonpar­
tisan movement to some extent but the
great bulk of the nonpartisan vote
came from the ranks of the two old
parties. Next fall the nonpartisan
vote will be bigger because at that
time the democrats who stuck to their
party ticket in the primaries will be
at liberty to vote for the men they
choose and it is certain that a large
number of them will cast their votes
for the nonpartisan candidates. This
they could not do at the primaries be­
cause nearly all the nonpartisan can­
didates were on the republican ticket.
Parshall Leader: It will be inter­
esting to note the attitude of the daily
papers which have so strenuously op­
posed the League and Frazier. Will
they stick by their party nominee?
Had Burdick won they would have
virtually poured out their insides in
appeals to the farmers to stick to their
republicanism, and now the situation
is on the other foot it is up to them to
show they are "good republicans."
STRONG INSURANCE COMPANY
Berthold N. D., July 7.—The Grant
Farmers' Mutual Fire and Lightning
Insurance company held its annual
stockholders' meeting here last Fri­
day afternoon. This meeting was not
as largely attended as former meet­
ings, probably owing to a belief in the
business ability of the officers of the
company—W. N. Suydam, president:
H. H. Craig, treasurer Jos. H. John­
son, secretary, all of whom were re­
elected. Wise and judicious manage­
ment of the company's affairs has
placed it among the largest and
strongest mutual organizations in the
state. It is now carrying a million
and a half dollars in risks. During
the past fiscal year ending December
31st last, its losses amounted to only
$697.50, making it a very cheap insur­
ance for farmers to carry. The com­
pany has been especially fortunate in
its losses, in no one year since its or­
ganization has the amount been bur­
densome to its members.
Popular Sawyer Couple Weds
On Tuesday morning. July 11th, at
St. Leo's Catholic church, occurred the
marriage of Mr. Arthur P. Sillman
and and Miss Myrna M. Robinson.
The couple were attended by Miss
Winnie Robinson, sister of the bride,
pnd Mr. James Robinson, a brother of
the groom.
The bride is a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Cook Robinson of Sawyer and is
a most estimable and accomplished
young lady, and one of Ward county's
most prominent teachers.
The groom is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. G. F. Sillman. one of our most
highly respected and prosnerous fami­
lies. Arthur is a successful and ener­
getic young man who will make good
in his chosen profession and has a host
of friends who wish for him and his
young bride a pleasant and prosperous
journey along life's pathway.
The happy couple left immediately
for western points. Upon their return
they will start housekeeping at once
in a cozy home prepared by the groom
at Sawyer, N. D.
HEAVY FIRE LOSS
Shortly after the noon hour on
Wednesday of last week, in the midst
of an electrical storm, lightning struck
the store of Bogan Brothers at Ar
doch, the bolt striking on the east end,
or rather the rear end of the store. It
tore a large hole in the roof, came
down through the floor and hit the
gasoline tank of the lighting plant,
which exploded. Frank Bogan was
alone in the store at the time and was
dazed by the shock. The explosion of
the tank caused the fire to spread with
frightful rapidity and he had only
enough time to escape to the front of
the building and get out when anoth­
er explosion caused by gases blew the
front out of the store. The fire de­
partment was on the job and had the
streams playing on the building but
the flames had gained such headway
that it was seen that their efforts
were of no avail and they confined the
fight to saving the Windsor hotel.

FARMERS AID
LOFTUS FAMILY
Endowment Fund Proposed for Bene­
fit of Man Who Has Fought the
Farmers' Battles
St. Paul, July 13.—A movement is
under way among the farmers of the
Northwest to raise an endowment
fund and to invest it in farm mortga­
ges for the benefit of George S. Lof
tus and his family.
The movement has been started by
the Equity members, but it is stated
the funds are to be raised by popular
subscription among all farmers.
The funds are to be turned over to
the Equity Rural Credit association at
Fargo.
It is said that Mr. Loftus was never
a man of large means, and that al­
though his salary as sales manager of
the Equity Co-operative Exchange has
been paid regularly since his illness
as before, the family funds have been
almost exhausted by the expenses at­
tendant upon his long illness.
The fund is to be raised in resogni
tion of his services to the farmers' or­
ganizations of the Northwest.
BABY DIES IN SMALL
SLOUGH WHILE AT PLAY
Child, 17 Months Old, Killed in Un­
usual Accident Near Parents'
Home Near Kenmare.
Kenmare, N. D., July 12.—Roma
Hanson, the 17-months-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. Albert Hanson, living six
miles from this city, was drowned in a
peculiar manner. The mother of the
baby was looking after some household
duties, and the baby, who was just be­
ginning to toddle about the house with
ease, wandered to the rear of the barn
where the father had been using the
manure from the barn to fill a slough.
This was filled completely, except one
place about eight feet in diameter,
where there was a depression, at the
bottom of which was about a foot of
water. The little one toddled to the
edge of this depression and fell for­
ward into the water and was drowned
before he was discovered by his par­
ents.
Would-be Short Change Artists.
Shortly after noon today a couple of
would-be short change artists made
the rounds of several of the business
places on Central avenue and after
making some trifling purchase, would
manipulate the changing of the money
in such a way that an argument
would ensue, and their idea seemed to
be that they could talk the proprietors
out of their coin. However, after sev­
eral unsuccessful attempts, the police
were put on their trail and they left
the city hurriedly in an auto.
BR AK EM AN GROUND TO
DEATH IN SANISH YARDS
Peter Jensen, a brakeman on the
mixed local train, met a horrible death
at Sanish last Thursday night about
10:40 o'clock. The engine of his train
had finished some switching and Jen­
sen threw the east switch to let the
engine pass to the round house. A
work train passed about that time and
the supposition is that he tried to
board the train in the darkness an:i
fell, the wheels passing over him. The
body was disemboweled and he lived
but a few minutes. Jensen's home was
in Kenyon, Minn.
Mrs. Nick Arend Died in St. Paul.
The many friends of Mrs. Nick
Arend will be pained to learn of her
death which occurred in St. Paul June
20. Mrs. Arend had been ill with tu­
berculosis for the past six years but
by careful treatment, her life was pro­
longed. Mr. and Mrs. Arend formerly
resided in Minot, where Mr. Arend
owned the Unique Grocery store.
B. W. Halsey Will Probably Return.
B. W. Halsey and family, who were
visitors in the city for the week pre­
vious. returned to Great Falls Sunday.
Mr. Halsey had some business to
transact at that point before leaving
on a vacation trip, which will include
a visit with a brother at Palmer, Neb.,
and a lengthy visit in Chicago. While
in the Windy City Mr. Falsev intends
to acquaint himself with the most
modern methods and machinery in the
laundrying and dry cleaning business
and expects to retf rn to Minot later
and re-engage in the tailoring and
dry-cleaning business and will also
open a thoroughly modern steam laun­
dry. The laundry, dry-cleaning, dveing
and tailoring business work nicely to­
gether, with practically the same over­
head expense for all three establish­
ments as is necessary in the case of
any one of them, if run separately.
For this reason Mr. Halsey realizes
that one department will help the
other in reducing the cost of operation
and this is mainly responsible for his
decision to enter all three branches of
the business. When Mr. Halsey lo­
cates here it will be with a plant sec­
ond to none, and his wide acquaintance
in the city will insure him a large pat­
ronage.
The Halsey family have a multitude
of friends in Minot who will be de­
lighted to know that they are to again
make their home here. Mr. Halsey's
ability as a band director has long
been recognized and his efforts are
largely responsible for the enviable
reputation that the Minot band has
enjoyed in the past. His return will
greatly strengthen Minot's musical
field.

THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WE EKLY PAPER IN THE STATE
Minot, Ward County, North Dakota. Thursday, July 13, 1916.
iTECIMSSHOOT AT
MAN AND Wlf E IN AUTO
Mr. and Mrs. Joe Romatke Mistaken
for Train Robbers by Two Green
G. N. Detectives—Hit Auto
Two Great Northern special detect­
ives, mistaking Joe Romatke and his
wife for train robbers, shot at the
auto in which they were riding along
the Burlington road two miles west of
Minot Monday night about ten o'clock.
One of the shots struck the car, the
other missing the occupants by a nar­
row margin.
Romatke, who is a machinist em­
ployed by the Minot Auto Co., had
been in the country with his \vife for
a drive and was returning home. He
struck a bad place in the road and his
cap fell off. He stopped his car as
quickly as possible and went back to
look for his cap. Not finding it, Mrs.
Romatke got out and looked with him.
They saw two men with flashlights
approaching them from along the
track and they were told to stop. Be­
lieving that they were about to be
robbed, the man and wife ran quickly
to the car, jumped in and started down
thi road when the men began shoot­
ing. They proved to be two of the
new Pinkerton detectives who were re­
cently hired to take the place of A1
Ray's men who resigned. They had
ridden out on No. 401, a freight, train,
as goods have been thrown from the
train a number of nights, and they
supposed that Romatke and his wife
were waiting for the train to come
along. Mr. and Mrs. Romatke were
in the public highway when they were
attacked and they are very indignant
over the affair. It is reported that
they will institute a civil action
against the Great Northern. The af­
fair was reported to the police at once.
and the detectives were brought up
onto the carpet. The police went out!
with Romatke and found his cap.
MIKE BREEN ACQUIESCES
Mike Breen, editor of the Wolford
Mirror, comments on the nonpartisan
victory in his unique style. Mike
fought the league but he is willing to
abide by the decision of the majority.
He says: The majority is not always
right, but The Mirror is willing to
amde by its decision. Vive la Nonpar­
tisan! Which translated into English
by our dog, Bruno, means "Hurrah for
Hades! Who's afraid of fire?"
The Willow City Eagle, who opposed
the nonpartisan league, is now run­
ning the republican ticket at the head
of the editorial column and says the
Eagle will support the entire ticket.
A large number of the publishers con­
sider that the fight was over when the
polls closed on June 28 and will sup­
port the ticket complete.
Will Send Unfortunate Woman to
Montana.
Mrs. John Brehl of Miles City, Mon­
tana, who went by the name of Edna
Gray, was arrested by the police at
her home on the south hill in the
southwestern part of the city Wednes­
day afternoon, charged with running
a disorderly place. An individual
from Canada who came to Minot to
escape service in the army, was with
the woman, and he ran to the weeds,
not taking the trouble to dress. He
was found and arrested. The woman
is in the last stages of tuberculosis.
The authorities will send her to Miles
City, where her brother lives. She is
but 24 years of age and her condition
is pitiful.
Ward County Breeders Will
Exhibit at State Fair
E. S. Person will ship eleven head
of registered Guernseys from his Elm
wood farm to the state fair at Fargo
the last of the week. Included in the
lot is Lura Bettina, the state's cham
piijn cow, and other Guernseys the Ma­
jor exhibited last week at the Minot
stock show. He will undoubtedly re­
turn with plenty of blue ribbons. J.
A. Sorenson, superintendent of the
farm, will accompany the cattle and
the Major will go to the fair a day
later. B. B. Mouck will exhibit his
prize Guernsey bull, which was bred
at Elmwood farm.
Chester Phifer, the Burlington Du
roc hog breeder, will exhibit thirty full
blooded porkers and he expects to
bring back a number of ribbons.
Officious Detectives to be Arrested
Warrants have been issued from the
states attorney's office for the arrest of
the two very officious Great Northern
detectives, one Stocking and Dan Mc
Gillicuddy, who are charged with
shooting in an attempt to do bodily
harm. The complainant is Mr. Ro­
matke, an employe of the Minot Auto
Co. The detectives mistaking Romat­
ke and his wife for box car thieves,
shot at them twice the other evening.
SONS OF MARQUIS DE
MORES ARE LIVING
REPORTS NOT FOUNDED
Medora, N. D., July 12.—A report
has been current around Medora that
the sons of the late Marquis de Mores
had been either killed or wounded in
the army in France, but a cable from
the Marquise de Mores yesterday says
that they are both safe.
Another Clothing Store for Minot.
N. Klein has secured a lease on a

"MINOT PROSPERING"
QUOTES THE FORUM
Fargo Forum: W. E. Holbein, sec­
retary of the Minot Association of
Commerce, who came to the city yes­
terday to appear before the Society of
Equity committee that is considering
the proposal to establish a co-opera
tive packing plant, remained over to­
day to look after other business mat­
ters.
Mr. Holbein, since he has located at
Minot. has become one of that city's
most ardent boosters, and he declares
the magic city is growing at a re­
markable pace this year.
With many new industries, and with
a buildinsr campaign that will give Mi­
not excellent new facilities, Mr. Hol­
bein says Minot is enjoying one of its
best years.
Tried to Collect Debt of Dollar With
Gun.
Rasmus Lesseth, of Carpio, was
placed under arrest, brot to Minot and
placed under bonds to keep the peace.
He tried to collect a dollar from a
neighbor, Martin Miller, which he
claimed was coming to him. He sent
word to Miller to pay the dollar or ho
would shoot him. Lesseth mounted a
hill near the Miller home with a gun
and remained there waiting for the
dollar or his opportunity to shoot. Mil­
ler sent word to the authorities and
the arrest followed.
Mrs. Jason's Waterloo.
At a meeting of the Advanced
Thought Club the other afternoon,
Mrs. Henry Jason arose and said with
bated breath: "Sisters, there is a
devilish plan afoot against us women.
The men have planned to call the next
election suddenly and we will have to
vote before we have time to consult
our pastor. This is abridging our
rights, and I, for one, will not stand
for it." "Sister Jason," broke in Mrs.
Philander, who hates the old panther
like poison, "the way to thwart the
men is not to vote."—Osborne, (Kan.)

HEART FAILED
WHILE BATHING
Norma Young Man Meets Death in
the Mouse River—Body is Re­
covered.
Norma, N. D., July 12.—Einar Si
monson, aged 22 years, a prominent
and popular young business man of
this place, met his death while swim­
ming in the Mouse river at the Mouse
river park near Tolley. Death wag
due to heart failure. He, with a num­
ber of others, was bathing in the river.
He went down and it was thought h?.
had dived, but the failure to reappear
aroused the suspicion of the other
bathers and they hurried to his assist­
ance. The body could not be located
and was in the water an hour and
twenty minutes before it was recover­
ed.
When the body was recovered no
water was found in the lungs, thus
showing that death was due to other
causes than drowning.
The deceased was engaged in the
garage business at this place with W.
B. Johnson. He was a young man
well liked in both social and business
circles and his untimely death cast a
shadow on the whole community."
He was unmarried.
ROWLAND GUILTY OF MURDER
Williston, N. D„ July 10.—John
Rowland, a Mountrail county farmer,
was found guilty of murder in the sec­
ond degree by a jury in the district
court here Saturday night. The jury
fixed the penalty at twenty years im­
prisonment in the state penitentiary.
The verdict was returned after a de­
liberation of only two hours.
According to the case built up by
the state and accepted by the jury,
Rowland killed Harry Walcott, 20
year-old son of a neighboring farm­
er, as the result of bad blood which
has existed between the families for
some time. Young Rowland, with a
companion, was passing the Rowland
home with a load of hay when the lat­
ter opened fire upon them with a rifle,
one bullet taking effect in the body of
the young man and causing his death.
Bankers May Play Ball.
The First International Bank has
issued a challenge to the Second Nat­
ional Bank for a base ball game to be
played at an early date. The chal­
lenging bank employs eight husky ball
players and will secure a crack catch­
er and the Second National has the
"makings" of a good team. E. A.
Long suggests painting the picture of
a dollar on the horsehide sphere and
believes that the bankers will not miss
many of the flies. A suggestion has
been made that bundles of greenbacks
be substituted for the ordinary sacks
at the bases, which would insure some
speedy running.
Sold 173 Lots in Two Hours.
During the lot sale in the Roach ad
diiion in the northeastern part of the
city, conducted by the N. P.' Dodge Co.
of Omaha, 173 lots were sold in a
couple of hours. The price ranged
from $60 to $239 per lot and terms of
$1.00 down and 50 cents a week were
