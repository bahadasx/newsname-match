NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE BUILT
UP TO WAR STRENGTH DE
PARTMENT WILL PLACE 210,000
MEN ON BORDER.
Washington, July 12. Immediate
organization of an extensive nation
al guard recruiting service was au
thorized today by tho war department
to bring regiments on" border duty
up to full war strength of about 1G0,
000 men. With nearly 50,000 regu
lars on border duty, the government
would have 210,000 men or more en
gaged in protecting the line.
Three officers will be assigned to
the recruiting service for each regi
ment ordered to the front. Each sep
arate battalion, company, battery or
other unit will have one officer. The
adjutant general of the respective
states will supply the names of of
ficers for this duty.
Recruiting has been made necessary
by the fact that all unfit men and
those with dependents to support are
to be discharged from the guard regi-i
ments as rapidly as possible. While i
the work of filling the gaps was in j
progress, however, it was determined i
to go a step farther and attempt to
fill the regiments up to full war
strength.

poration commission Wednesday ap
proved plans for a new freight depot
for the Santa Fe at Ardmore. The

jV TWO VlEVVg Or TRANS ATLANTIC SUBMARINE ael SIMON LAKE-
Another of tho perplexing (I'instions of international law growing out of the war in F.urnpo was presented to tjie
United States government by the arrival at Halt imore of the German submarine Deutschland. which came from
(iermany. Tho state department was called upon to detemine whether the first undersea craft to make the trans
atlantic voyage should be treated us a merchant vessel or us a belligerent. If the submarine is a merchant vessel
engaged in peaceful commerce i.nd this is the prevalent view) it is entitled to all the rights and prerogatives of
any other belligerent merchant vessel in an American port, free to conn; and go as it pleases and at its own risk
of incurring damage from enemy vessels outside the entrance to American territorial waters. Hut if this sub
marine entered American waters as a belligerent warship, tho so-called "twenty-four-hour rule" applies, as in the
case of any other warship, and the Deutschland is subject to the rub's of international law that this government
invoked in the cases of the Kronprinz Kitel Friedrich and the l'rinz Friedrich Wilhelm. The situation was fur
ther complicated by the action of Simon Lake, inventor of submarine vessels, who asserted bis Intention of libeling
and ttius holding up the Deutschland if it contained nny of bis patented devices. Mr. Luke said that the Krupps
copied his plans when he was in (iermany in 11)04 and iy0!.

FINE SAMPLE
CORN GROWN NEAR SPRINGER)
IS SUPERIOR TO ANY EVER
SHOWN IN THIS SECTION OF
THE STATE.
For several years F. K. West, tho'
present secretary of tho Chamber ot
Commerce and of the Carter County
Fair association has been advocating
broom corn to the farmers about
Springer and along the foot of tho
Arbuckle mountains trying to im
press upon then the fact that that
particular section is adapted to broom
corn culture. Wednesday, to vindi
cate his theory, Ag;-nt Carl Russell
came from Springer with some of
the finest samples of broom corn ever
shown In this section of the state.
Mr. Russell states that there has
been considerable acreage of broom
corn planted this season, 'and from
present indications the acreage will
be materially increased another year.
Mr. West states that the samples,
shown are superior to any he has
seen in the state, and hopes that
farmers will devote more acres to its
culture another year, in place of cot
ton. PASTORS EXCHANGE PULPITS
