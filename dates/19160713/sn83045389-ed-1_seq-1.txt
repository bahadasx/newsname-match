TARTS. July 12.?The substitution of
paper rolls for celluloid films in mov

the new "cold" light discovered by the
French #n printer, Dussaud, which Is
described to the. Academy of Science
by Trofessor Rranley, with whom Dus
saud studied the new light, is obtained
liy automatic separation of heat rays
from luminous rays which occur to
gether In all sources of light hitherto
Known to science.
The quest of an absolutely pure j
light. devoid of all heat, long has been I
one of the great problems of modern
physics. The electric light is the
nearest approach to this ideal, but far
from it, as It gives off a certain amount
of heat.
M. Dussaud has been working on this
problem for many years. The light ob
tained by his method is so intense
that it is possible to throw images
from newspaper illustrations, picture
postcards and photographic, print on
n/ screen even In a lighted room as
clearly and sharply as If tfoey were

M.W VOHK. July 12.?While Health
1 om missioner Kmerson declined to
night to discuss the report that a
v York physician had succeeded in
isolating the uoim of infantile pa
ralysis, great importance was attached
by medical men to the meeting of phy
sicians to-morrow night. which will
be devoted to a discussion of the dis
ease which has cost more than 2."?1
lives in this city since the epidemic1
>egan. Among- the speakers will be i
Dr. Simon Klexner. of the Rockefeller!
Foundation, who is devoting his ener
gies to a study of infantile paralysis j
It was semiofficially admitted "that
scientists have progressed so far that
they are testing a culture in which
they believe they will find traces of
the germ and ultimately isolate it.
There was a feellncr of optimism in,
the Health Department to-day. Fewer
cases were reported than yesterday; no
new areas were infected.
HKAI.TII OKFK'KIIS ASKIOI)

Health officers of Chicago. Phila
delphia. Boston. Buffalo. Albany and
other cities have been asked to report
any persons who go to those cities from
infected areas in Xew York and develop!
the disease there. Xo further restric
tive measures will be imposed in this
city at present. Dr. Emerson said.
Dr. John Dill Robertson, health com
missioner of Chicago, who came here
to-day to Investigate the situation, de
clared his department had not been
called upon to treat an unusual num
ber of cases of infantile paralysis
During the twenty-four hours' pre.1
reding 10 o'clock this morning onlv
seventeen deaths from the disease were
reported in the five boroughs of yow
^ ork City. Tliete were ]??_? new cases.1

The spread of the disease is gen- ;
era II.v around tne centers in Soutli
Brooklyn and the lower Wast Side of
?Manhattan, where the epidemic has
nourished since its development early
in June. Some cases, however, have!
been discovered in the other .sections
of Brooklyn, and a few i? the upper i
residential districts of Manhattan.
The .Mayor stated that the city has
facilities sufficient to handle all the
eases thus far reported, and that there
are in the hospitals too more beds
available for patients, while there is
plenty of ambulances and nurses.
Warnings against a panic were
issued by the .Mayor and by the health i
commissioner. The latter said the
fatalities from infantile paralysis had
not been nearly so great as from other
epidemics. II.- pointed out that in the!
last epidemic of measles here there
were from 600 to !>00 cases a day, while '
the mortality ranged from 20 to 50 per
cent. More lives were lost and more !
permanent injuries resulted from
measles last year than will ensue from
this outbreak of infantile paralysis,
the commissioner said.
Pending tl'e action of Congress
upon I he request of Secretary McAdoo
for an appropriation of $135,000 to
enable the 1'ublic Health Service to in
vestigate the spread of the disease,
that service is continuing to advise the

LSALTLMORfi. July 12.?That plans
wore afoot rapidly to reload the super- \
submersible Deutschland and slip her
out speedily on lier return voyage to
Germany was indicated to-night. A
special permit was obtained for con- j
tinning the unloading of the vessel
to-n{ght. and it was expected she
would be ready by to-morrow to begin I
taking on a cargo of nickel and J
rubber.
N"o one in authority would say when i
the vessel would depart, and the only !
positive statement in that connection j
was contained in Captain Koenig'x
declaration to the local customs o ill -
<ers that he expected to sail "within
ten days." The tug Thomas F. Tim
minx completed repairs to-day and
took up a position directly in front of]
the Deutschland. When the Timmins
entered dry dock, it was reported that
she was getting ready to return to the
Virginia rapes to convoy into th&
Chesapeake, as she did the Deutsch
land. the submarine Bremen, which is
said to he four days on her way to
this country.

The air of mystery surrounding all]
discussion of the Dentschland's de-i
parture was deepened to-day by re
ports that her clearance papers may
not be made public when tiled, thus
preventing advance notice of her leav
ing being obtained.
Conferences here between represen
tatives of the Ocean Navigation Com
pany and of the Grupp Steel Company
and Simon Lake, inventor of the. sub
marine. have #;ivoii rise to reports that
a company was in process of formation
for the purpose of carrying on under
sea commerce between this country
and Germany, and that Mr Lake had I
been invited to accept the position of I
consulting engineer.
While 11 o otlicial announcement could!
be obtained from Paul CJ. L. llelken. j
the American representative of the i
submarine interests, it is understood i
that plans for the new venture will lie
sent hack to Germany on the Deutsch
land. .Mr. Lake is said to have reached
a satisfactory agreement with th*
owners of the Deutschland. and to have
abandoned any intention of liheling Ihe
vessel.

WASHINGTON. July 12.?Although
State Department officials virtually are
convinced that the German submarine
Deutseliland is strictly a merchant ves
sel. the idviee of the neutrality board
probably will be sought before a final
ruling is made.
Acting Secretary Polk indicated to
day that the ruling would not he de
layed and may be announced to-mor
row. It is understood lie considers that
there is nothing lacking to establish
the Dentschland's status as a peaceful
merchantman, and desires to consult
the neutrality board only in order to
give added weight to the department's
formal decision.
The detailed report of Collector Uyan
at Raltimore, holding that tiio sub
marine could not he c?viverted into a
war vessel without 'e\lunsi\e tlrui
/(
tural rhanRos," was forwarded by the |
Treasury Departm -ni to-day 11? Mr. |
Polk. 1J. probably will be mado public
to-morrow.
Tho allied embassies hero added
nothing to-day to the representations
they have made suggesting that the
Deutschland is a potential warship, and
Mr. Polk said be anticipated no sorious
opposition from that quarter to the'
department's ruling.
\l-:i THAI. JIKItCU.WTM.W
CO.WtH l'*tIII M IIMAItl.M:
Diplomats of the allied countries re
ceived information during the day in
dicating that the Deutschland was
convoyed from Firemen almost to the
Chesapeake capes by' a neutral mer
chantman. presumably Norwegian,
Swedish or Dutch, which aided in j
shielding lier from detection 1)> enemy
warships and also acted as a tender. I
This information may l?e communi
cated later to the State Department j
and investigation requested. Allien !
warships are said now to lie searching
for the convoy ship.
Various rumors that the submarine j
might have had a convoy have reached !
the State Department, but none was
given credence. One was that a Brit
ish steamer which put into the Ma
deria Islands had sighted on June 23
in the Atlantic a large submarine
bound eastward in convoy of a steamer.
Tho State Department already has
begun consideration of questions re
garding departure of the Deutschland.
To prevent violation of neutrality by
forwarding of military information
from this country regarding the
Deutschland's movements, oflicials are
considering whether tae government
should prevent dissemination of news
of her sailing.

Other troublesome questions proh- I
ably will arise from the visit of ttio j
I Deutschland. otlieials realize, but they
will be considered as they develop.
| The State Department to-day for-'
nially denied published reports that it !
would not be .concerned if the Deutsch
land should be attacked and sunk in
violation of international law by hos
tile warships after leaving the United
States. It was stated that this gov
ernment is interested in all matters
affecting the conduct of the war and
methods of reprisals by any of the bel
ligerents, even though no American
citizens should lie immediately in
volved.
Interest in reports that other Ger
man merchant ships may visit the
United States was indicated by a dis
patch sent by the department to-day
to the American consul at Hrenmn, in
quiring why be did not confidentially

With Respect' to Responsibility for
IleportinK Commissioner's Funds.
As late as March 17, 191ft, Judge
Prentis, of the State Corporation Com
mission. one of the three members of
the State Tax Hoard which last Fri
day removed Kxaminer James S.
Kaflc.v from office. declared in a letter
to Mr. Kasley's father that he knew
the Sixth Circuit examiner of records
to be a diligent ofllcer.
Tn a letter to Governor Stuart, dated
.March "3, Congressman Carter Glass,
of Lynchburg, wrote, referring to Ex
aminer Easley: "1 happen to know that
be recently performed the duties of
his position with great firmness and
fidelity in the face of singularly em
barrassing circumstances."
It has been common knowledge that
the "embarrassing circumstances" un
der which Mr. Kasley labored at l.yneh
burg grew out of his assessment of
omitted taxes against Craddock. Terry
X- Co., large shoe manufacturers. John
\V. Craddock. head of the firm, being
his uncle. Friends of Mr. Kasley made
public yesterday the letters of Judge
Prentis and Representative Glass, but.
In deference to the Governor's request
when permission for its publication
was sought last week, the letter that
Governor Stuart wrote to Mr. Glass in
reply was not released.
<;ovr.nnoh ixnic.Ated

While the Governor's letter was not
available, it has become known that
he informed Mr. Glass of his own per
sonal knowledge of the embarrassment
that confronted Mr. Kasley in the per
formance of his duties in I.ynchburg.
and Indicated that full justice would
be accorded the examiner by the St-ite
Tax Hoard.
Kroin the tenor of these letters from
Governor Stuart and Judge Prentis,
written a little more than three
months ago, there was nothing to fore
shadow the action in which they par
ticipated last week. The publication of
the correspondence yesterday muddled
still further a situation which was
everywhere acknowledged to be sadly
in need of a clarifying statement by
the Tax Hoard. This will probably not
be forthcoming until Governor Stuart
returns from his Itussel County home
late this week or early next.
On March -.1. 19l?>, Congressman Car
ter Glass wrote to the Governor as
follows:
