City physicians and nurses will be placed on guard
Friday at all Seattle railway stations and passenger
wharfs to guard against any influx of infantile par
alysis victims.
Health Commissioner Mcßride and Dr. H E. Coe, in
charge of the contagious division of the city health depart
ment, have timed the situation, and estimated that children
being rushed from New York to the Pacific coast would be
logically arriving from Friday on.
All adult* and children showing symptoms of sickness
will be examined at the stations.
As an added precaution, railroad officials have agreed
to instruct all west-bound conductors to telegraph ahead if
their trains carry any persons who appear to be ill.
Should victims he brought to Seattle and have no home
to go to where they could be properly isolated, they will
be taken to Firlands and cared for there.
Five city medical inspectors were detailed to start to
work, with two nurses, watching incoming trains Friday.
Six other physicians will be at the city hospital, subject
to emergency call.
No cases had been reported at any of the railway stations
up to noon Thursday, and no new cases in other parts of the
state had been reported to State Health Commissioner Tuttle.

Whether the disease germs
come from diseased cows or
get Into milk later, the depart

altho the favored theory is the
latter. Paralyais amonj cows
is said to be rare.
"Probably the majority of
adults have suffered at dome time
from mild cases of paralysis," said
Dr. Rueker. It may have been di
agnosed at the time as a summer
complaint ' Many attacks believed
to be 'hummer complaint' really
are developments of paralysis."
Other sources of the germ are
believed to be dust clouds, sheep,

Elimination of flies.
In case of Illness when infantile

The tendency to try family rem
