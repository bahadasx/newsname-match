' While Waiting.
.
^New York, July T.-^-The German
i sailing ship Indra began to discharge
here today a cargo of nitrate from
m Chile, valued at $1,000,000. When
f she arrived here bringing the cargo
in September, 1914, it was worth only
$125,000, but the demand for the
chemical for the manufacture of exy
plosives has greatly increased its1
price since then. The result is that
while lying in this port for nearly
two years the value of the cargo has
increased to $875,000.

Storm Damage There Estimated at
| $250,000.
Pensacola, Fla., July 8.?Damage
estimated at $250,000 resulted from
the hurricane that struck Pensacola
Wednesday morning and continued
' for 24 hours. The wind attained a
sustained velocity of 104 miles an
V- hour but no lives were lost and the
damage is considered remarkably
light in view of such high wind.
. The Pensacola fishing fleet suffered
greatest damage. Several of the
little vessels were 6unk or badly battered.
Other vessels in port were
driven ashore. The steamers Alcina
and John M. Keen appeared to be
hard aground tonight and it may, be
c necessary

lloat them. The power boat Santa
Rosa, of the United States engineering
corps was sunk.
Forty cadets of the Gulfport Military
academy who were on their annual
cruise were forced to spend
Wednesday night in their vessels and
1 were blown ashore Thursday morning.

TO TRAIN AT PORT MOULTRIE.
Mobilization Camps to Be Discontinued
as Soon as Guards Leave.
New York, July 7.?Mobilization
camps in most of the v twenty-two
States of the department of the east
will be discontinued, it was announcedHonight
at divisional headquarters,
Governor's island, as soon as the last
National Guard organization called
out by the president has departed fox
the border.
With the closing of the camps, recruits
will be trained at army posts
already designated, according to an
order issued today by Major Gen.
Leonard Wood.
It was found that the contemplated
plan of maintaining^ the State
camps for training recruits would enforce
the absence of scores of regular
army and National Guard officers
from their border commands.
Among the army posts designated
are: Tennessee, North Carolina and
Georgia?Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.
Florida and Alabama?Fort Baran
cas, -Fensacoia.
South Carolina?For Moultrie,
Charleston.
Gen. Wood said tonight dependents
of National Guardsmen have
flooded him with letters and telegrams
requesting him to discharge
Guardsmen as a result of the recent
war department order. He said he
wished it emphasized that soldiers
with dependents cannot be discharged
by the "commanding officer of the
department until the request is first
made by the soldier, with corroboratevidence.
DISCOVERY T)F AMERICA.
Its Cost Said to Have Been Seven
Thousand Dollars.
The discovery of America cost a
little more than seven thousand dol
lars, says the American Boy. At
least so say some documents that
have just been found in the archives
of Genoa. These documents give the
value of Columbus's fleet as three
thousand dollars. The great admiral
was paid a salary of three hundred
dollars a year, the two captains who
accompanied him received a salary of
two hundred dollars each, and the
members of the crews were paid at
the rate of two dollars and fifty cents
a month each.

Carranza Sends Conciliatory Note to

Washington, July 5.?JEarly resumption
of friendly diplomatic con's
versation with the de facto government
of Mexico, to the end that peace
v and order may be restored in north
ern Mexico and along the border, is
expected here to be the next step of
' the United States in its relations with

its southern neighbor.

The crisis precipitated by Villa's

a j tween American and Mexican troops

pated by an amicable note from Gen.
r! Carranza presented today by his am-!
bassador designate here, Eliseo Arredondo.
The note proposes that the differ5,
ences between the governments be
a settled by mediation or by direct neq
gotiations. It is remarkable for its
brevity, its restrained and friendly
tone and for the absolute lack of any
^ of the strong, even insolent, language
? which characterized the last two
Q
communications from the de facto
j government. It treats as a closed inQ

n The fact that Secretary Lansing

i-, regarded as significant, however, of
a feeling on his part that the crisis

There is every indication, however,
that in the present instance it will
be deemed desirable to conduct forth"7
coming negotiations directly with the
. Carranza government.
Members of the Latin-Ameyican
7' diplomatic corps here are expected to
make inquiry soon as to the attitude
of the Washington government, in
view of the statement of the Mexis
can foreign office that it awaits only
a decision here as to whether mediation
or direct negotiations would be
preferable. Indications tonight were
that the inquiries would be met with
it assurances that the two governments
had reached the stage where they
would not find it necessary to call

78 DEATHS ARE REPORTED
FLOOD ANI) STORM DEVASTATE
LARGE AREA.
Alabama and Georgia Principal Sufferers.?Rivers
and Streams
Swollen Out of Banks.
Tornadoes and floods in Alabama,
following the destructive tropical
hurricane on the gulf Wednesday,
had caused 78 known deaths Friday.
In addition to crews of two
schooners were believed to have been
drowned off Ship island when their
vessel foundered Wednesday. Property
damage in Alabama and Mississippi
will total more than four million
dollars.
The known deaths: An engineer,
killed when his train ran into a
washout at Bond, Miss; a fireman
killed; three negroes drowned in the
flooded districts near Birmingham,
while riding on improvised rafts;
two negroes drowned when a small
boat foundered on the Warrior river,
near Tuscaloosa.
Reports from Gulfport, Miss, say
the American schooner Mary G.
Dantzler, the Norwegian schooner
Anezia and an unidentified two-masted
vessel were lost off Ship island
Wednesday. The Anezia's crew was
rescued, but no trace was found of
the others. Each ship carried twelve
men.
Gulfport also reported the fournrmfitod
AmpriMTi hark en tine John W.
Myers and the pilot boat E. E. Barry
beached on Ship island. A lumr
ber barge was reported sunk.
Rescued by Boats.
Valley creek, near Birmingham,
overflowed after a rainfall of more
than ten inches in forty-eight hours.
Street railway and railroad traffic
was demoralized. Boats were used
to bring marooned persons from their
homes in the lowlands. The city fire
department was called on for rescue
work.
The Autauga creek overflowed into
the streets of Prattville, Ala., flooding
many stores. /
Late reports from Beloit, Ala.,
where seventeen negroes were reported
killed in Wednesday's storm,
definitely establish that there were
no lives lost, though thirteen persons
were injured.
The river packer, M. Carnet,
crashed into a lock on the Warrior
river, near Tuscaloosa, and sank.
The crew escaped.
A Selma, Ala., dispatch that four
persons were killed in Mobile Wednesday
lacks confirmation.
Crime Decrease in Columbia.
Columbia, July 9.?Decided reductions
in law breaking are to be observed
in the report of Chief of Police
Richardson for June, 1916, when
contrasted with a similar report filed
with the city council for the corresponding
month one year ago. The
report of the month just closed 6hows
that only 418 men were tried in the
recorder's court against 728 for June,
1915. Of the number tried one year
ago 86 were sent to the chaingang
against 28 for the same month this
year. The number of calls for the
police by citizens was cut down from
273 to 140. Of the 728 men and
women, both white and black, to be
tried, only 31 were charged with
drunkenness and isorderly conduct
with 14 arrests for violation of liquor
laws.
Dozen "Do's" for Youths.
A dozen "Do's" for church-going
folk have been prepared by the Rev.
C. L. Peck, of Cleveland.
Here are his "Do's" for young
men:
Demand a strict account of the little
things in life.
Build your fortune in good manners.
Tact and c'ommonsense are the secret
of a successful life.
Have grit and pluck.
Live within your means. Extravagance
is the road to failure.

and make a Christian life your foundation,
Be on time.
Always wear a smile in the home,
office or factory. You must take your
joy to heaven with you, for you will
not find it there.
Be prepared for your jobs.
Have respect for honesty.?Cleveland
Press.
Arredondo plans to call at the department
tomorrow to say good-bye
to Secretary Lansing before the lat-|
ter's departure for his vacation.
Probably the preliminary steps necessary
for the inauguration of the informal
discussion will be taken then.
LADEN SUBMARINE ARRIVES.
First Undersea Merchantman is Now
at Baltimore.
Baltimore, July 9.?The world's
first submarine merchantman, the
German underwater liner Deutschland,
anchored below Baltimore tonight,
after coming safely across the
Atlantic, passing the allied blockading
squadrons and eluding enemy
cruisers watching for her off the
American coast. She carries mail
and a cargo of 750 tons of costly
chemicals, and dyestuffs and is to carry
back home a similar amount of .
nickel and crude rubber, sorely need- \
ed by the German army.
Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, .the submarine
reached the Virginia Capes at 1:45
o'clock this morning, passing in on
the surface, covered by darkness
which settled over the entrance of
i
the bay with the setting of the moon.
Once inside the visitor threw caution
aside and began shrieking his sireen,
signalling a pilot and at the same
time attracting'the attention of the
tug Thomas F. Timmons, ^hich had
been waiting in the lower bay for
nearly two weeks to greet the
Deutscbland and convoy her into
port.
German Flag Flying.
Three hours later the big subma- .
rine started up the bay with the German
merchant flag flying, under her
own power, piloted by Capt. Frederick
D. Cocke, of the Virginia Pilots'
association, and convoyed by the
Timmons. She was making more
than twelve knots an hour and could
have docked in Baltimore tonight,
but arrangements had been made for
receiving her with formal ceremonies
tomorrow and her captain
was ordered to wait in the lower harbor.
He and his crew of twenty-nine
men remained aboard their craft.
Regarding his vessel as a merchantman,
subject to no unusual restrictions,
the skipper, whose name
1C caiH ha fonf Tfai wan* 11 n
??*** w AA-CMAl^,, up
the Chesapeake without waiting to
notify local customs and quarantine
authorities of his presence. He was
five hours away before Norman Hamilton,
collector of Norfolk and Newport
News, heard the news, and started
on the trail on board the coast
guard cutter Onondaga. At last reports
the Onondaga had not reached
the submarine, and it is understood
that she merely was ordered to keep
the strange craft under surveillance
as a neutrality precaution. Quarantine
port regulations will be complied
with when the vessel moves up to
her dock tomorrow.
THE AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY,
>
Report of Great Religious Organization
for 1915 Very Encouraging.
The recent observance of the centennial
of the American Bible society
lends especial interest to its report
for 1915, shortly to appear. This report
will show that 2,500,000 copies
of Bibles or parts of Bibles, were distributed
last year in China alone.
r \
Concerning these there is an interesting
story to relate. A Chinese philanthropist,
Yung Tao, purchased 5,000
New Testaments to give to
friends. These Were distributed last
year. Each book contains a presentation
slip bearing these words: "Respectfully
presented by Yung Tao,
who is not a church member." Another
slip contains some excellent advice
to the reader, and then several
well chosen quotations from the Bible.
The agent of the Bible society called
on Mr. Yung at his home in Peking,
and Mr. Yung returned the call
at the Bible house. The agent records
his judgment that Mr. Yung is
an humble follower of Jesus Christ,
tuny irnouea witn jtiis spirit, tnougn
not a church member. Mr. Yung told
the agent:
"I have only just started on my
work of Bible distribution. I intend
to put copies in every school in the
whole of China and into the hands of
every teacher and official."
At the same time the society's
agent reports that owing partly to
war conditions, but principally because
the appropriations have been
reduced, he has been obliged for the
present actually to stop printing
books and will soon have to stop the
distribution of the books already
printed in some parts of the country.
TV?o ctnplr nf Srrintnres has been
nearly sold out.
The Bible society thought it a significant
and touching fact that one
missionary in China who is personally
far from rich sent in a centennial
gift of $144 in gold to New York.
Officers of the society hinted that
there could be no better example set
for Christians in America interested
in the Bible society's work.
