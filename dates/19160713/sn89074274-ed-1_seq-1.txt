Mrs. Mitchner has at her ready
command volumes of information and
statistical knowledge that make
her addresses go home readily
and impress one that here is a speak
er who 'is familiar with her subject.
And, indeed, she ought to be, for Sun
day she gave her audience the experi
ence of 35 years of her active work.
Music in the morning was furnished
by Mrs. Knute Froysaa and Miss
C-ladys Fridd, who sang a duet, "I
Waited for the Lord" by Mendelssohn.
Ben Goodsell played "Spanish Dance"
by Sarasate. This short musical pro
gram was immensely enjoyed as part
of the morning service.
In the afternoon, the Valley City
Municipal band appeared in a preludp
at 2:30 and again following the ad
dress of Dr. Wylie. Director Hubbard
had arranged an especially fine pro
gram which was played as well as any
band has done here for a long
time. In their white duck trousers and
blue coats and caps, the boys made a
natty looking organization. Valley
City is proud of her band.
Dr. Wylie gave the principal address
of the afternoon on his subject, "Par
enthood by Proxy." It was a stirring
appeal for a closer relationship be
tween parents with their children. Dr.
Wylie's address is reviewed elsewhere
in this issue. He spoke again for a
short time during the evening, follow
ing the concert in which members of
the choirs of the Valley City churches
took part.
This program was opened by the
Valkota male quartet, consisting of
Messrs. Hunt, Buckwalter, Zimmer
man and Meyer, who sang "Chant
Anthem" by Dow. Later-on the pro
gram the quartet appeared again sing
ing very effectively "Nearer, My ^God
to Thee" by Sweeney and "Lead, Kind
ly Light" by Dudley Buck
Prof. Froysaa played Meditation
from Thais as a violin solo, and Mrs.
Craswell was forced to respond to her
solo, singing that ever popular "Moth
er o'Mine."
Prof. J. B. Meyer sang "0. Divine
Redeemer" by Gounod, with violin
obligato by Prof. Froysaa. Miss Jos
ephine Wright was at the piano during
the evening and Rev. Willard Crosby
Lvon presided.
The program was an exceptionally
interesting one from every standpoint
and showed again the fine talent Val
ley City has at her disposal.
After the address of Dr. Wylie came
the moving pictures. Some extrava
gant remarks had preceded the show
ing of "Judith of Betliulia" but they
were not amiss, for the film was not
only intensely interesting from a spec
tacular standpoint, but it was a ser
mon in itself, and a fair indication of
what the management intends to make
this feature of the daily program. Oth
ers like it are coming.
Child Welfare Work
Daily From 3:30 to 6
While Monday was a day of prepar
ation for child welfare week at the
special tent provided for this work at
Chautauqua, quite a number of exami
nations were made. As announced the
work will continue throughout the
week.
For the convenience of those in
terested in having their babies exam
ined and scored the management has
arranged to have this work conducted
daily from 3:30 to 6:00 every after
noon. Dr. Acher and specialists and
a nurse will be at the child welfare
tent during these hours.
While this work is continued be
cause of the many requests and the
interest shown, mothers of the com
munity in general are urged to bring
their babies and have them examined
by these specialists.
The pipes have been laid for the
feed and outlet of the new memorial
fountain to be erected on the Normal
school campus, as the gift to the
fechool of the class of 1916. The foun
tain will be placed to the left of the
walk leading to the main entrance of
the school. It consists of four basins
and will make a beautiful addition to
the campus.

People Flocked to
Chautauqua Sunday
Program Excellent
As anticipated Sunday was a hum
mer at Chautauqua. The weather was
fair and beginning early in the morn
ing people flocked to the grounds until
the attendance exceeded that of any
previous day of this year's assembly.
There were many out-of-town visitors,
though the attendance from outsid6
of Valley City was materially cut by
the condition of the roads caused by
the heavy rains of the latter part of
the week.
The day's activities began with the
regular Sunday school hour at 10
o'clock. Public worship was held at
11 o'clock, with Mrs. Lillian Mitchner,
president of the Kansas State W. C.
T. U., the speaker of the morning. All
of the glowing accounts of Mrs. Mit
chner as a public speaker, as a con
servative thinker on matter pertaining
to her cause, as a fine personality and
as a reader of human nature, were ful
filled Sunday morning. Mrs. Mitchner
•dwelt for some time on the work of
her state and spoke also on the sub
ject of prohibition in general, and im
pressed her audience with her simple
sincerity.

which suddnly came up just before
midnight Thursday struck the big
Chautauqua tent at Spiritwood lake,

Mayor Moe Received Model
of Fjelde Pioneer Statue
Tuesday morning Mayor Moe re
ceived the model of the statue that is
planned to be erected to the pioneers
of Barnes county. It was direct from
the sculptor- Paul Fjelde. Mr. Moe
had it on exhibition at the old
spttlers' reunion in Chautauqua park
Wednesday. The figure surmounting
the granite pedestal is of heroic mold,
and on the same order as the famous
statue erected in honor of the "Minute
Men" at Concord, Mass, There is
hardly any doubt about the old set
tlers' association approving both the
model and plans for the erection of
such a suitable monument.
Catholic Ladies' Aid
Plan Another Outing
Mrs. Heimes has extended an invita
tion to the ladies of the Altar society
and their friends to spend the after
noon at her splendid home, three miles
west of town, on Thursday. All indica
tions point to a record breaking at
tendance at this meeting, the road is
the finest in this part of the country,
and the well-known hospitality of the
hostess and her family will be equal
to any emergency. Automobiles will
leave Gray's store at 2 o'clock sharp,
the charge will be 25 cents for the
round trip, payable to the driver upon
entrance into rig.
Owing to the illness of the president,
Mrs. Greenwood, the members and
their friends are requested to omit tel
ephone calls to her residence in con
nection with this outing, since a suf
ficient number of automobiles will be
provided- to take care of all who wish
to avail themselves of the opportunity.
Let all the members take a personal
interest in this matter, and help make
the afternoon one of usefulness and
pleasure.

Agitation On to Promote
Events for a Race Date
Lack of interest is the reason given
by the committee, but it is thought
that misunderstanding by the many
clubs making application for entry of
the $100 forfeit money, has a great

the desired number of entries.
Give A. C. Enforcement
of Various State Laws
Fargo, July 11.—A new department
to be known as the regulatory depart
ment of the state government was cre
ated yesterday by the board of regents
in session at the Agricultural college.
Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the col
lege, will be the head.
The department will have super
vision of the state pure food, pure seed,
pure beverage and full measure de
partments and stallion registration.
It will be the duty of the department
to see that the state laws in these
matters are enforced.
Dr. Ladd was retained by the board
to have supervision of all this regula
tory work because of his long connec
tion with that department.
While, in the opinion of the board,
this branch of law enforcement really
is not a part of the college, it was
deemed best to keep it there as it has
been, but put it all under one head to
insure uniformity of action.
Dr. Laadd will appoint his assistants
in each division as soon as the matter
comes up for readjustment.
Miss Alberta Batherick will take the
place of Miss Addie Gilbert, resigned,
as matron of Ceres hall.
With the opening of the new school
year a cafeteria will be established at
Ceres hall in connection with the din
ing room.
Present at the meeting of the board
yesterday were Dr. J. D. Taylor, of
Grand Forks Emil Scow, of Bowman,
and Secretary Charles Brewer, of Bis
marck.
Secretary Brewer said last night
that things are in fine shape at the
farm school and that prospects are
bright for the coming school year.

Postponed Fair Races
Made Interesting Card
There is a movement on to arrange
races for a date about July 26, at
which time it is intended to stage au
tomobile races, a farmers' horse race,
and a motorcycle race. The automo
biles would be classified and entries
from Barnes county only would be re
ceived. The fine half-mile track at the
lair grounds is probably the best in
the state, and should the weather con
ditions be favorable, many records
would go glimmering. A few success
ful meets of this kind would no doubt
convince the lovers of this kind of
sport that a mile track would be the
thing, and if one could be establish
ed here, Valley City would become the
Mecca of the best automobile and
horse drivers in the country. The
management in this instance are not
out to make money, but want to try it
out to get the sentiment of the public.
To do this the price of admission on
this day will be only 50 cents.
Orders to Entrain
Militia Are Held Up
Eismarck, July 10.—Orders for the
militia to entrain Sunday evening and

were 44 licenses issued, and this year
69 licenses have been issued from Jan.
1 to the present date. During the
month of June there were 23 marriage
licenses issued, compared with eight
last year, which shows a decided in
crease over the corresponding months.
Up to the present date there have been
four licenses issued since July 1, com
paring about the same to date as last
year.

ESTABLISHED 1«7t.
The races at the Barnes county fair
that were postponed from Friday were
run Saturday afternoon and proved to
be a big drawing card and brought out
a good attendance
The 2:09 pace for a purse of $400 at
tracted afield of five starters that lin
ed up for the flag as foollows: Mischief,
b. g., driver Pigott Holly Brand, b. g.,
driver Spencer Rob Roy, b. g., driver
J.^ Murphy Fern wood, b. g., driver
Walker Danioa, b. in., driver Johnson.
This race was won in straight heats,
the first three finishing in every heat
in the same order as they started,
something unusal in a race so closely
contested. The best time was made in
the first heat which was paced in
2:10',1.
Following this the mule derby of
half mile was staged with C. J. Lee,
Harvey Pray, Casper Winkler and
Frank I.annon driving. Frank Lan
non showed up the others by coming
under the wire with a big lead and
Harvey Pray drew a $25 fine from the
starter for driving in the wrong di
rection.
The motor cycle race of five miles
had the following entries: Harley
Davidson, driven by Art Olson, Fargo
Harley Davidson, driven by Speed
Johnson, Fargo Harley Davidson,
driven by Shorty Thompson, Fargo
Excelsior driven by Frank Hammond,
Oakes Excelsior driven by Alexander
Ja( obson, Valley City. Speed Johnson
won first money finishing the five
miles in 8:18. The track was good
and the race close. The Fargo en
tries showed some clever riding and
were not more than 50 feet apart dur
ing the ten laps. Another motorcycle
race was put on 'by the same partes
in the evening and was well contested.
This was run for a collection purse
and was not under the auspices of the
fair. The time was not given, but was
about the same as the race of the aft
ernoon.
The automobile race had four en
tries. Bill Davis drove his Stutz, John
Russell drove his Paige. F- Frederick
son, a Velie and H. Haumann an Over
land. Bill Davis finished ahead, John
Russell was second and Baumann
third. The Velie man had engine
trouble and dropped out early in the
contest. The Overland was only a 30
horse power car and made a good
showing against the larger cars, which
were unable to gain a lap on it during
the ten. The time of the winner was
6:41.
At the conclusion of the automobile
race Starter Robbins announced that
the Barnes county fair was over for
1916, and thanked the people of Valley
City and patrons of the fair for their
attendance and courteous treatment.
Mr. Robbins proved a fair and ef
ficient starter, and it is understood
that he will officiate in a like capacity
at the state fair in Fargo.
Lisbon Man Is Official
of National Sportsmen
C. O. Heckle, of Lisbon, president of
the North Dakota State Sportsmen's
association, has been elected vice pres
ident of the American Amateur Trap
shooters' association, the national gov
erning body of the gport. This action
was taken by a unanimous vote of the

follows: John Philip Sousa, of New
York Dr. Horace Betts, of Delaware
Charles W. Billings, of New Jersey
Prof. James L. Kellogg, of Massachu
setts, and Stanley F. Withe, of Mary
land.
The American Amateur Trapshoot
ers' association, of which Bandmaster
Sousa is president, aims by uniting in
one organiation the 500,000 shooters
and 5,000 trapshooting clubs in this
country, to strengthen and stimulate
the various club organizations and to
bring about a greater development of
the individual shooter by providing an
incentive for regular practice at the
traps.
So successfully have the plans of
the association worked out that the
official medals awarded for averages
of 75 per cent and over, have become
the national standard of skill at the
traps. The most coveted award is the
solid gold medal awarded for an aver
age of 90 per cent.
Any trapshooting club may become
affiliated with the A. A. T. A. and eligi
ble for the medal awards without cost.
Application should be made to C. O.
Heckle, at Lisbon, or to the national
secretary, Stanley F. White, Baltimore,
Md.
Keyes Gets Splendid Yearling
A few weeks ago F. L. Widdifield, of
Leal, advertised for sale in the Times
Record a yearling Red Polled bull. The
ad. brought a buyer quickly in the per
son of E. E. Keyes, of Ashtabula, who
acquired the animal to head his herd.
Mr. Keyes is a good judge of cattle and
was much pleased to find so good an
animal bred and raised in Barnes
county. Mr. Widdifield has earned
considerable renown by the quality
of the cattle he is raising, due to his
careftll methods and intelligent care.
He informs the Times-Record that he
will not be able to exhibit at the state
fair this year, due to the scarcity of
farm help, it taking all his time to
handle his farm.
