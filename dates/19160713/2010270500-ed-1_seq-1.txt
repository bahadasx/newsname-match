est of any day since the boys have

Sioux City Journal, 10: Two hun
dred people yesterday attended the
first annual picnic held at Crystal
lake by the Liberal Labor league, ot
South Sioux City. A basket dinner
was served atnoon on the grounds.
The afternoon was taken up with
athletic events. Chief among these
was the old man's walking race, par
ticipated in by three men over 70
years of age. -The race was won by
E. Brummett.' The other contest-.
anta'were Dr. Leonard DeVore and
G. A. Frederick. In the forenoon
the gathering was addressed by J.
J. McAllister, of Dakota City, on
the subject, "Labor." A baseball
game was played by teams from the
Labor league and Crystal lake, the
latter winning in four innings, 3 to 2.
....Thousands of Sioux City resi
dents yesterday forsook their homes
and sought coolness in the various
parks about the city and along the
river and lake fronts. The swelter
ing heat in the downtown districts
drove people from the hotel lobbies.
Places of amusement in the business
district were losers by reason of the
hot weather. During the afternoon
trolley cars carried load after load
of perspiring persons to Crystal lake
and Riverside park. Family groups
and picnic parties earlier in the day
went to the resorts, carrying with
them baskets of lunch. At Crystal
lake many were bathing. Two base
ball games were played. Dancing
was featured in the evening. Free
band concerts and singing were giv
en at Riverside park during the after
noon and evening. The river was
lined with canoes and and launches.
Practically all of the boat clubs were
crowded. Heavy passenger traffic
was reported yesterday at all rail
way stations. The rush was due
largely to departure of outing par
ties for smaller towns nearby and
and arrival of others from the Bur
rounding country. The torrid tern
fierature and dust made automobil
ng uncomfortable until evening.
Sioux City Journal. G: August
Voss, one of Nebraska's foremost
feeders operating in the vicinity of
Nacora, was awarded a toppy price
for a load of yearling heifers on
this market during the midweek
trade. For nineteen head avera
ging 798 pounds he received $9.15.
The cattle were put in the feed yards
immediately after being weaned.
A ration of corn and alfalfa was
used during the entire period of fat
tening, and highly satisfactory gains
in weight resulted . . . .Four persons
were slightly injured when a motor
car, driven by E. J.. McKernan, a
rural mail carrier of Dakota City,
Neb., was struck and overturned by
another car, driven by Lampson, of
Walthill, Neb., Tuesday night. The
collision occurred five miles South
of Dakota City. All the injured
persons were passengers in the Mc
Kernan car. vine iampson car was
wrecked, but remained upright, and
its occupants were unhurt. Riding
with Mr. McKernan in the car were
Mr. and Mrs. Earl Wright, Univer
versity Place, Neb., and their small
son Investigation of the Com
plaint made by the commercial club
of Homer, Neb., that the Burlington
railroad bridge in that town is a
source of danger to foot passengers
is to be made by the Nebraska state
EfZiruuwuy cumiiiiBaiuu, which unnqunc-
tS ed that a hearing will be held at
Homer on July 14. A copy of the
complaint of the Homer people has
been filed with the Burlii.,,ton road
and an answer has been mude by the
general counsel of the company and
placed in the hands of the commis
sioners. The company admits the
dancerous character of the bridge,
but asserts that the responsibility
for that condition rests with the
town. The hearing will be attended
by practically every resident of the
town, as well as by farmers in the
outlaying territory Five casese
of beer, twelve gallons of whisky
and a carton of brandy were seized
and two men arrested last evening
at 7:80 o'clock by Detective Fred
Spencer. The men, Roy Garner and
Joe Bodes, were charced with the il
legal transportation of liquor. Bodes
and Garner had gone to Jackson,
Neb., for the load of liquor and had
delivered one package when inter
rupted by Detective Spencer. The
liquor was consigned by J. Robin to
Sioux City residents. The shipping
bills Were those of the Interstate
Transportation company, a Nebras
ka corporation, but the name of the
carrier was marked out and Robin's
name substituted. A charge for
gery was placed against Garner.
The police alleged that Garner cash
ed a check for $5.20 at the meat
market of W. G. Warner. 217 Fourth
street. The name of Mrs. E. Ward
a Mid-West bank depositor, was
signed to the check.
County, Agent's Field Notes.
BY A. H. BECKHOFF.
In Koimr over the fields
of this
county one cannot but be
struck
potato
.with the prevalence of the
blight this year.
Some of the fields are only affect
ed to a moderate degree, while oth
ers are damaged to the extent of
half or more. The blight this year
is characteristic in fields the seed for
which was shipped in mainly from
the north.
I have carried on a few tests to
note the effectiveness of corrosive
sublimite in controlling this disease.
On all '6f these demonstration fields
check plqts were maintained.
Let me especially call your atten
tion to potato demonstration fields
on the farms of John Sohn, Fred
Schult, Herman Ebel and T. P. Mc
Glashen, where the effects now are
plainly discernible and where the
beneficial effect of the corrosive sub
limate shows up in marked contrast
against where not used.
The common preventative meas
ure is to use bordeaux and spray the
vines when they are young. But
for the most effective way is to plant
seed that is clean and free from
blight.
My purpose in calling this to your
attention is that you may be on
guard. At harvest time I will hold
some demonstrations and again be
fore planting in the spring. Plan to
attend these.
The use of formalin and corrosive
sublimate will help to eliminate scab
to a marked degree also. Those of
you who have used formalin in the
treatment of oats for smut, should
take an hour off and go over the
area treated and note the difference
in amount of smut present.
Notice
There are many reliable farm pa
pers issued nowadays that supply
the farmers and stockmen with cash
able and workable ideas,' but the best
Buited to the farmers of this section
is Farmer and Breeder. It is issued
semi-monthly at Sioux City, la., and
is intensely interesting and practical.
It regularly carries veterinary, dai
ry, poultry, horticulture, home and
fashion departments in addition to
market and live stock news. The
special feature stories about success
ful farmers and breeders give many
valuable hints, suggestions, and les
sons that any intelligentfarmer can
apply with profit.
