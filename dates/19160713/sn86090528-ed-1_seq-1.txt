Grady County Carries Off All Honors in
Moonlight School Contist
at State Normal at
Edmond
Special to the Express.
Edmond, Okla., July 13. Grady
county has gained. another victory in
the educational field, capturing the
prize, offered for the best work dono
by a moonlight school in Oklahoma
last year. Great interest has been
manifested throughout the state, in
this unique and important branch of
education and it remained for Ninne
kah to cany off all honors hands
down in the race for efficiency and
excellence. To the Ninnekflh school
goes the prize of a purse containing a
$10 gold piece awarded by the Colo
nial Dames. E. H. Russell is super
intendent of the Ninnekah school, and
Mrs. Russell is one of the teachers.
Statistics showed that there were
more moonlight school workers in
Grady county than in all other coun
ties represented combined and this
excellent showing is , due in large
measure to the activities of County
Superintendent Shepard and his co
workers, who are now attending
the central state normal here.
An interesting feature of the contest
was the fact that R. M. Cofcr, a sub
stantial farmer and citizen of Ninne
kah, was the guest of honor of Grady
county. It is not generally known
that it was Mr. Cofer who inspired ftie
editorial, "Launched on an Adven
ture," which appeared some time ago
in the Chickasha Daily Express.
"The editorials and news items
which have appeared from time to
time in the Daily Express aided Nin
nekah wonderfully in landing the
prize," declared Mrs. Russell today,
"and I do not doubt if Grady county
had been listening at the right time,
they could have heard the cheer that
was sent up for Ninnekah by the 2, -too
teachers when the result was announc
ed. "The editorial, 'Launched on an
Adventure,' which appeared in the
Daily Express last winter, will be re
printed in the leading papers of the
state and Superintendent R. H. Wilson
Is having it published in the Moonlight
Bulletin which he is getting out.
"We feel that the Express has a
share in the honors we have won,"
said Mrs. Russell in conclusion, f,rat
ified at the splendid results which
were achieved through the efforts of
her enterprising husband and herself.

IN CONTEST
Judge Davenport Decides to Probate Will
Making Son of Elizabeth J.
Skaggs the Sole Bene
ficiary
That he had decided to probate the
will of the late Elizabeth J. Skaggs
was the decision rendered by County
Judge Davenport this morning when
counsel for the opposing parties met
iu the county court room. All of the
evidence was in yesterday afternoon
but his honor took the matter under
advisement until today. No notice
of appeal has yet been given.
This case, which occupied the at
tention of the county court for the
past two days, presented phases which
were difficult of solution. Prominent
hankers of this city, who do not pose
as- experts on handwriting but who
are qualified to judge owing to their
broad experience in this line, spent
several hours on the witness stand,
called by opposing attorneys. Three
of these witnesses declared that while
the writing in the will and in letters
known to have been written by Mrs.
SVaggs were similar they . believed
they could detect a difference. They
explained, however, that this differ
ence might have been due to increas
ing age of the testatrix or the posi
tion, standing, sitting or reclining, in
which the various documents may
have been written.
Ed Johns, cashier of the Citizens Na
tional bank, however, testified yester
day afternoon that, he was familiar
with the handwriting and signature
of -Mrs. Skaggs, she having transacted
her business with that bunk and he
having at various times handled her
notes and mortgages, having had oc
casion to see much of her penmanship,
lie testified to the authenticity of the
will, declaring that in his opinion it
had been written and signed by Mrs.
Skaggs, making Masoner sole heir to
the $i.")00 property.
Another" witness was introduced
yesterday afternoon. This was Mrs.
McGee, a friend of the deceased, who
testified that Mrs. Skaggs had express
ed to her her regret nt cutting her
daughter out of her will asserting
that, she should like to leave Mrs. Kel
ly a portion of her estate, but would
rot do so on account of differences
which existed between Mrs. Skaggs
and Mr. Kelly.
TEN LOADS OF CABBAGE.
"Have you ever seen cabbage that
could beat this?" asked County Weigh
er Lee McReynolds of a representative
of the Daily Express, as he prepared
to weigh a load of the finest looking
product that lias come to Chickaha
i.l late years. "This is the tenth wag
on load which has been weighed roday
and they are as fine specimens as I
have ever seen. This wagon load
makes fully a carload which has ben
brought in today."

TOWNSHIP FAIRS

Secretary Cooper Finds It Difficult to Fur
nish Forty Judges in "a Single Day
and Give Satisfaction
That it is impossible to do justice
to all township fairs when a half doz

time Is th idea which Secretary
Cooper, of the Grady County Farm bu
reau would impress on all township'
committeemen who have been called
to meet with him In Chickasha on
Monday,' July IT. at 2 P tn.
"This meeting has been called for
the purpose of arranging dates for the
various township fairs and to decide
upon other matters in connection
therewith," said Mr. Cooper this.
morning. The fairs would be more j
successful if arranged iu a string and
not come together as they did last
year when twelve of the twenty were
held on the same day. It is almost
impossible to furnish forty competent
judges at one tim and greater satis
faction is assured when not exceeding
two or three are held simultaneously."
