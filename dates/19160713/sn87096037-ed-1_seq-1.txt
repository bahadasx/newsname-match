HOPE'S SECOND ANNUAL
CHAUTAUQUA NOW ON
Program is Giving General Satisfaction
and Attendance is Increasing Daily.
Chautauqua opened Monday
afternoon under ideal conditions.
I'he Committee in charge of the
udvnnce sale of season l.iekols
was more than jiieased with the
manner in whieli the people re
sponded to their announcement
that the tickets were on sale and
when the time arrived to check
up it was found that the sales
had exceeded those of last year
by a nice margin, the total heing
5j08 adult's and 107 child's tick
ets.
The Superintendent, liev. C.
C. Davis, and his chief assistant,
Mr. Preham, alias "Friday" who
constructs the comfortable seats
without upholstering and pitches
the dog-tent, had arrived several
days before and everything was
in readiness for the opening pro
gram which was given bv the
clever Russian musicians, the
Savnmoffs, who pleased the au
dience both afternoon and even
ing. Stewart I. Long, with his
inspirational lecture, ''Reaching
the Goal", brought many new
ideas and ideals to his attentive
audience. His many witty illus
trations made a decided hit. The
lecture by Fred J. Clark, in the
evening, gave much food for
thought to the large audience.
He spoke on several kinds of
fools, and in order to pave the
way for his subject showed that
a successful fool is very popular
at the present day, citing for
examples Charlie Chaplin, with
his

"The Borderland" and he is

the idea which is lining promot

Japan is far too dependant upon
this country to bring any dis
aster, such as war with us would
be, upon herself. To tin
of the old sweet songs of yester
day, the progia.ni in the evening
given by the "Old Home Sing
ers" was a decided h-ast, and as
those favorite old songs brought,
back memories almost, fadi-tl
many an eye glistened with tears
that could not be stipresseil.
But there was many a smile too,
and a hearty laugh, when the
company appeared in the coloni
al costumes of the war period
and sang the old comic songs
such as "Reuben, Ueuben, I've
Been Thinking", "Polly-YVolly

and so on.

the programs on Wednesday was
the feature of the course. Ma
dame Cafarelli sang several
numbers and basing our state

again she made a decided hit.
At the close of the program we
heard a number state that they
would like to hear it all over
again.
fn writing the program we
omitted one feature that is by
no means the least important,
it is the funfest for the children
under the direction of the play
specialist, Marguarite Sclunitz.
The people will be given a chance
to see what the children have
been doing when they give their
"dress-up" program on Friday

The programs for today and
tomorrow promise to be up to, if
they do not surpass, those that

Built for the
Business Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the fanner wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset, to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is coining out of the ground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
fanner's automobile. The price, $665. puts it with
in the reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
ancl appeai*ance the Dort merits a careful invests
gation of the Business Farmer.

"With a "kl-yl" and an aggravatlBg
rattle the scared dog shot around
corner, a tin can banging from the en&
of its tail.
The small boy who had fixed the tin
can In its place stopped laughing when
a Ktern voice came to his ears.
William"—It was his father who
spoke—"did you tie that tin can to the
poor dog's tail?"
Willie did some rapid thinking. Then
he replied Innocently:
"Yes, father, I did. I'm trying to do
one kind act every day, and that deg
is always chasing cats, so I tied the tia
can to Its tail so that it would suke a
noise and warn the poor little cats."
