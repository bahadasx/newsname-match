LULA L AGENT
MUST QUIT EATING
CRUP BEFORE MAUE
South Must Stop Time-Honored
tem Of Economic Suicide,
Says H. G. Hastings
8ys
Atlanta., Ga.—(Special.)—"The peo
ple of the south must quit eating their
cotton or other so-called 'cash crop'
before it is made if they ever expect
to accumulate wealth and have the
comforts and luxuries of life due
them," says H. G. Hastings, agricul
tural vice president of the Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce, and a fore
most authority on farm conditions In
the southeast . «
a uo Sonin must stop rorsTer it*
time-honored system of economic sui
cide," says Mr. Hastings. "Advance
steps were made last year toward a
condition of farm independence in the
Cotton Belt They were forced steps,
it is true, but they marked an advance
just the same, and more bread and
meat, more grain, forage and other
food and feed stuffs were made in
1915 than ever before, with the result
there are tens of thousands of farm
ers better off than in past years,
despite short crops and business de
pression.
"With higher cotton prices, it is
going to be a great temptation to
drop back into the old habit, of put
ting cotton, or whatever other cash
crop one may be growing, in pawn
for bread and meat.. We are suffer
ing today from the old system forc
ed on us by conditions following the
Civil war, necessary then, but unnec
essary now.
"Year after year we have stayed In
the same old rut as a matter of habit,
eating our crops, so tua—Mr,. before
they were made, a^Mffcially suicidal
policy for the fajjAr, each year put
ting his nose a Tittle closer to the
credit grindstone.
"If the south had not been so rich
in natural resources, this system
would have bankrupted us long ago.
What's the answer? It is home pro
duction by each farmer of every dol
lar's worth of food and grain supplies
needed on his farm that it is possi
ble to grow on his own acres. This
means good big home gardens; hogs,
chickens, cows and something to feed
them on through the year."
