JASPERjfJTY FAIR
MEETING ATltIERA HOUSE
TONIGHTjdORGANIZE
Citizens and Farmers are Urged
to Attend and Start the
Bail Rolling
A meeting will be held tonight
Thursday to moke preliminary ar
rangements for the 1D1G Jasper City
Fair Inquiries regarding and requests J
for catalogs are already bejng made
and it is realized by thfcV officers of the
committee and all tlidsc who have
heretofore been active in this work that
an early start should be mude
A date in the flrs few days of Octo
ber is being considerid as Just ntthat
time farmers are generally in the best
shape to give the fair their attention
It was long ago proven to the satis
faction of our people that this fair has
been a most potent factor in the devel
opment of agriculture and stock rais
ing in this section besides being of
unequaled advantage in an advertising
way However we have not been get
ting the advertising from the event
that we should because catalogs and
other descriptive advertising matter
has not been gotten out early enough
to be of the most advantage
Of course the reason for the late start
we generally make In the arrangements
is due to ttie fact that we have no sal
aried bJDcers and the men who do the
bulk of the preliminary work are busy
men with their own affairs and find it
hard to give the fair work the attention
It should have That difficulty could
be easily relieved if more men would
consent to work on committees thus
dividing the work and making it lighter
on individuals It just resolves itself
down to this proposition that nearly
everybody wants the fair but very few
want to do the work
Tli public spirited men who hove
heretofore done this work and in fact
some of them have carried the burden
the past nine years are entitled to a
little relief Not that they want to
shirk at all but they need and should
have more help
Lets have a good big meeting of
farmers and citizens of the town and
put tho 1110 event on its feet for an
early start
