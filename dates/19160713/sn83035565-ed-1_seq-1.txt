VOL. 85--Established 1832. GREENVILLE, OHIO, THURSDAY, JULY 13, 1916 - NoTiT
Political Gossip from
Washington.
Washington, July 12. (Special
Correspondence. ) D e m o c ratic
leaders in Congress find little con
solation in a review of election
figures in the socalled ''doubtful'
states. With Republicans and
Progressives united and working
in harmony, it is little wonder they
view the outlook with despair,
The combined votes of these two
partie.9 is enough to give Demo
crats the cold shivers. For in
stance, in Indiana in 1912, the
Republican and Progressive vote
was 313,274, while the Democra
tic vote was 281,890 : in Illinois
640,011 against 405.048 Demo
cratic; in Ohio 506,393 against
432,152 Democratic: in Michigan
369,828 against 150,751 Democra
tic; Minnesota 193,190 against
106, 426 Democratic : Nebraska
127,124 against 109,109 Democra
tic; Iowa 281,594 against 183,376
Democratic; New York 845,440
against 655,476 Democratic; New
Jersey 234,245 against 178,289
Democratic. This is what Wilson
leaders are up against and they
know it.

The way some of the leading
Democrats, most of them .from
the South, opposed aid to the fa
milies of soldiers who enlisted for
service in Mexico, caused consid
erable unfavorable comment a
bout the capitol. The fact that
men prominent in that party in
the Senate succeeded in defeat
ing the proposition occasioned no
end of discussion. ' Many Repub
licans have been heard to express
the view that it is the duly of
this nation to care for the wives
and children of the soldiers. They
say that it is cheaper than main
taining a great standing army
and that the humane act is an
encouragement to the volunteer
to enlist
XXX
Senator Gallinger of New
Hampshire nipped in the bud a
scheme to boost the salaries of
some of the attorneys, special a
gents and examiners in the re
cently organized Federal Trade
Commission. Under the leader
ship of Senator Hollis, a Demo
crat, a plan was on foot to raise
the pay of tnese assistants from
$5,000 a year to $7,500, which
would have caused the reduction
of the small-salaried clerks, in
order to get the money to boost
these well-paid attorneys. Sen
ator Gallinger said : "If larger
salaries are given to the lawyers
of the Commission, certain other
employes drawing smaller "salar
ies would of necessity be dismiss
ed, because it is not proposed to
increase the appropriation. It
has been the custom in this body
for senators to make appeals for
those drawing small salaries and
not for. those drawing large sala
ries, and Iwas quite surprised to
hear the suggestion made by the
mover of this amendment." The
proposition was voted down by a
vote of 43 to 28, and thus anoth.
er Democratic "economy" prop
osition fell by the wayside. .

-Nearly every Republican sena
tor and member of Congress is
receiving the most encouraging
reports from the people "back
home" relative to the outlook for
party success at the coming elec
tions. Letters and personal vis
its from constituents tell of many
voters who supported Wilson four
years ago who will vote for Jus
tice Hughes this fall. Word also
comes of the return, almost un
animously, of the former Pro
gressives to the Republican fold,

The attempt of the present ad
ministration to muzzle the per
iodical press of the country by
placing in the hands of the Post
master General power to put al
most any magazine out of busi-
ness by sending it by freight,
has been given its quietus in the
Senate, and another un-American
proposition fostered by the pres
ent postoffice department has
been snuffed out by proper pub-
icity and the showing up of the
offensive provision proposed in
the postoffice bill.

H. Bi 13,114, a measure intro
duced by Congressman A. W. Ov
ermyer to legalize the manufac
ture of "pumice brandy,' has re
ceived a favorable report from
the committee on Ways and
Means. , The bill has the backing
of the Treasury department, and
also of the Department of Agri
culture, and will enable the dis
tillers to use the residue from the
grapes passed in the making of
wine and brandy by the addition
of a sugar solution. The product
is subject to the internal revenue
tax of $1.10 per gallon.

According to guesses in the
Census Bureau the state of Ohio
has 1,107,888 able bodied citizens
of military age. Thenumber in
the United States is placed at
21,071,076. This estimate is based
on the assumption that there has
been an increase of approxim
ately 10 percent in the popula-
tion of the country since the cen
sus of 1910. When that census
was taken the total number o:
male citizens and prospective cit
izens 18 years of age and over.
but under 46, was 19,183,000. O
this number, 14,224,000 were na
tive whites; 2,857,000 were for
eign born whites who had be
come naturalized or had declared
their intention of doing so; 2,-
052.000 were negroes, and 50,000
were Indians. The number of
foreign born citizens is partially
an estimate, since the census en
umerators were able to obtain in
formation as to citizenship from
only about seven-eighths of the
total number of foreign born
males. Native whites thus rep
resent about 74 per cent of the
total, foreign born whites ntarly
15 per cent, negroes nearly 11
per cent, and Indians about three-
tenths of 1 per cent.

Much interest has been mani
fested among the members of
Congress over an electrical roll-
call device that is on display in
thecapitol. The inyentor claims
that each session could be cut
down about one month by the
saving of time.

The congressman from this dis
trict is in receipt of the follow
ing letter from the Commissioner
of Pensions relative to the status
of pensioners who enter the Na
tional Guards ;
The laws of the United States
provide that no person in the ser
vice of the United States in the
army, navy, marine corps, rev
enue cutter service or coast guard,
either on the active or retired
ist, shall receive pension during
the period of such service.
Membership in the National
Guard not mustered into the Fed
eral Service does not affect right
to pension. This is true notwith-
tanding the allowances of pay
under the act passed June 3, 1916.
Should a pension cease Tby
reason of entry into the Federal
Service and an application for
restoration be made after the
termination of such service, the
matter of restoration will be de
termined upon the conditions ex
isting at the time of the applica
tion." '
xxx
Many of the committees have
practically suspended operations
or this .session. The Pensions,
nvalid Pensions and ' Military
Affairs committees will not re
port out any more special bills at
this'session. Some of the Park
committees are still at work, and
Congress will confine most of its
energies from now on to the ap-
propriation bills, which will be
the largest in the history of the
country.

Wide Flaring Hats.
Hats of wide spread have gone
back to the Merry Widow pro-

the attention of cartoonists, but
they have crept in so gradually
that only the initiated have no-

smarter the hat the less it is
trimmed, some one touch of flow-
ers, feather, fur, embroidery or
painting, occasionally a mixture
ot fur and flowers but not often.
The hat itself is the thing, its

The tariff plank promises no re
lief. The only hope is that a tar
iff commission may report some
facts on which the tariff may be
revised after ruin has already
come. The democrats aanere to
the Underwood tariff, closing
their eyes to what was happen
ing until the great war came to
shut our markets to European
products and to create an unpre
cedented European demand for
our products. On the tariff the
Democrats are unconverted.
