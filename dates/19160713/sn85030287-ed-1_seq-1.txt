. Yield is Good
: Most of the Meade county
farmers are rejoicing over the
fact that harvest is again over,
that in spite of dry weather, in
in the early part of the season,
and later, bail, thej have again
been favored with a bountiful
crop. Some bare already com
menced threshing, an-d both the
yield and the quality are good,
while others have not yet finish
ed cutting.

Dodge City Wedssedcy of last
week and returned the first of
"this week.
R. M. Painter, Dept. Com
mander of the G. A. R, was in
the city the latter part of last
week. He returned to Topeka
Tuesday.
Wednesday about noon the
fire alarm was turned tn and at
once the fire department re
sponded. Sparks from burning
trash set fire to a chicken house
on the premises of Grandma
Rosenberry, in the east part of
the city. The blaze was soon
extinguished.
Uncle Dick Skinner this week
sold a fine two-year old Morgan
colt to parties in Buffalo, .Wy
oming. This is the finest colt
that ever left this county, and
certainly isv a good advertise
ment for Meade county as the
home of fine horses.
Conditions are never so bad
but what they could be worse,
for instance: some of v think
we would like a good rain, while
those who are cutting their al
falfa might lose their entire crop
should such a thing happen. So
since the wheat is about all cut
and the feed crops not particu
larly suffering, perhaps it is
best that the rain doesn't come
at this time but ifs powerful
hot just the same.

"Fodder for Machine Guna"
The following editorial in the
Washington Post of Jane 30, on
"Fodder for Machine Guns,"
has struck a responsive chord
throughout the country:
"If the honor of the Uoittd
Stales can be maintained by
peaceful methods, who shall say
that the Nation should go to
war? - t
Those who want war must be
willing themselves to sacrifice
i heir lives' npou the Altai-' of '-national
devotion.
None but a poltroon and cow
ard would fail to make the sacri
fice if the honor of the country
were at steak, but only those
who are in possession of all the
facts in the Mexican situation
can decide what the nation de
mands. What man in public life, what
official or orator in the market
places, can say that he is more
jealous of the . national honor
than are the people themselves?
The honor of the Nation is safe
in the bands of the American
people. ;
What are the people saying?
What are tbey thinking as tbey
walk through the streets? What
are tbey saying about their own
supper table after tbey have re
turned from their daily work?
In one of bis speeches President
Wilson said:
"I would a great deal rather
know wbatthe men on the trains
and by the wayside and in the
shops and on the farms are
thinking about and yearning for
than bear any of the vociferous
proclamations of policy, which it
is so eay to read by picking up
any serf p of printed paper.'
Those who are expected to
sacrifice their lives upon the
battlefield, the fathers and moth
era wb. yield their sons and who
yield tbem willingly when the
honor of the Nation is at stake,
should have something to say
about the question of war.
-Two million of the men of
Europe lie in their graves as a
resuli of the mad war that is
still in progress and yet the hon
or of the nations involyed has
not yet been satisfied.
At Verdun 300,000 of the. fin
est men of France, Germany,
and England lie dead. The toll
demanded by European states
manship steadily is mounting,
and the end is not yet in sight.
Of the 2,500,000 men who were
in the Civil War on the Northern
side, more than 1,000,000 were
below the age of 21 years.
It is not the corporations, the
landowners, or the captains of
industry who have the vital in
terest in the question of war or
peace. It is not the politicians
or orator, the organizations of
public preparationists or public
pacifists tbat have the most at
stake. It is the average citiien
the citizen who earns bis bread
by the sweat of his brow, the cit
izen who loves bis family and
wants to continue giving that
family bis support and protec
tion who has the most at stake."
Fowler Chautauqua
Fowler Chautauqua begins
August 5th and lasts five days.
The Fowler people have bad a
Cbantauqua each summer for
the past five' years, and each
season has shown an increase in
attendance.' The talent secur
ed for this year is easily up to
their usual standard. A large
number of Meade people hare al
ready made arrangements to at
tend. . j : .... -vi.: ,.-!fjPi..
