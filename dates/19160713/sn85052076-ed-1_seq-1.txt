Can Christians Improve?
Some people seem to think that religion is like
life-insurance a necessary burden. You have to make
payment. You try to pay as little as possible. And
when you have paid you forget it till the next payment is
due.
But there are others who think of Conversion as a
birth. They begin as babies and expect to grow up. At
first all babies can do is to eat then they creep, then
they walk, then they begin to do useful things.
If a Christian is satisfied with himself then he is stunt
ed like the Pharisees. If he is hungry; if he is anxious to
do new things like a healthy boy or girl, then he is a
growing Christian.
Neighbor Chirstian, you could do and be more than
you are. You are like a ten year old child still in baby
clothes! Start out right now and act like a Christian of
some years as you are. Lova and the Spirit will lead you
to blessed blessed success.
What Kind of a Christian?
What kind of a Christian are you?
We know minimum christians -folks that don't
mean to be "lost", or to fall into drunkenness or crime.
They intend to hold a good position among reputable
church-members, and to get to Heaven when they die.
But they wish to get these blessings just aa cheaply as
possible. If thay can keep in the way of salvation by
contributing ten cents a week and going to church once
a month they would rather five that much than to give
morel
And we know maximum christians folks to whom
religion is the chief thing. They know the psalm beg
inning "I was glad when they said unto me let us go un
to the House of the Lord." They know the hymn that
says:
"Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be thine!"
Which kind of a Christian do you propose to be?

By Dr. A. F.
One observation which has lived
fur more than 200 years is this:
"The greatest influence on health
k exerted by thooe thing which we
most freely and frequently rtKjuirs
for our exlutenee, especially is this
true of water and air." Aristotle.
Water enters lately into the
makeup of our bodies and the food
we take. But it is not in iUelf a
food because it ean not build tissue
or generate heat Life, however,
ran be sustained longer without
food than without water.
Water is the most universal sol.
vent known. On account of this
property, it is especially liable to
become contaminated on eomiag in
contact with other substances, and
as is well known, is often a means of
carrying disease.
From a sanitary standpoint, water
is either good or bad, or may be
classified as pure or impure. A
practical classification of water Is
good, polluted or infected.
Good water may be defined as one
of good sanitary quality as deter
mined by taste, inspection and the
absence, of harmful bacteria. A
polluted water is that which contains
waste of either animal or vegetable
origin, and while not always cap
able of producing disease, must be
viewed with suspicion. An infect
ed water is one containing real dis
ease producing germs, which In
most instances is caused by the Im
proper disposal of exrretia from a
patient sick with typhoid or dya
entry. Fur ages, great value has been

given to"a pure water supply as
shown by the efforts of the ancients
to carry water from a safe source.
As our knowledge of purification of
water bat been increased, vast sum
have been spent for building Al
ters, settling basins, etc. Where a
good water supply has taken the
place of a poor one the expense of
changing has always been justifiable
because of the reduction in
amount of water born diseases. Thus
the death rate from typhoid fell

water purification plants, in Pitts

only medium for transmitting ty
phoid. It may be carried in the in
fected milk and food, or by flies,

However the great object lesson
of improved conditions in the great
cities with their thousands of in
habitants, allows no mistake that
polluted water is one of the chief
means of carrying typhoid. With
this knowledge, we should take every
precaution to make our supply, be
it well, spring, or cistern, as free
from contamination as possible.
Each man who uses from a private
water supply must take thought of
these things for himself.
Wells and springs, in most rases,
are easily made to have all the
qualities of a safe water supply.
Water issuing from a well or spring

A Mexican war has been avoided,
for the time being, by the last note
of Carranza and diplomatic measures
are still to continue. The influence
of the Latin-American states and the
unofficial peace delegates show that
new forces are coming into action
which must receive some recogni
tion. '
Rumors still continue to reach us
that Villa with a large band of fol
lowers Is making for the American
border, with the intention of making
another raid. What a mysterious
chara&ter he see ma to be. Our State
Department believes that he is alive
and active, while the War Depart
ment believes that he is dead. Mean
while, the American troops remain
on Mexican soil, and the flower of
our young manhood hurries to the
border.
The report of the massacre of two
hundred soldiers and camp followers
of Carranza by Yaqui Indians Intro
duces a new element into the Mex
ican situation, at least, one of which
little notice baa been taken. We had
almost forgotten that Mexico has a
very large Indian population, still
in tribal condition, in the back
country.
Much interest attaches to the ar
rival at Baltimore, of a German mer
chant submarine which crossed the
ocean, evading English and French
war vessels The submarine brought
to the United States a cargo of drugs
and chemicals. The Germans look
on this successful trip of their sub
marine with great joy and declare
the English blockade is broken. Am
erican officials are puzzled in de
ciding whether the vessel is a
merchant craft or an instrument of
war.

The leading event of the week la
the European war, is the great drive
which the Frig lish and French are
making against the Germans along
the 8omme River in northern France.
In spite of heavy rains, the mow
ment has continued with substantial
gains for the AHies. The Germans
have been (b'iged to draw forces
from the region around Verdun to
defend their lines against this new
attack.
On the eastern frontier of the
F.uropean war, the Russians have
been steadily gaining in their ad
vance into Galicia, taking several
towns, with many prisoners and
guns. The great combined drive
against the Germans on both fron
tiers seems to be under way ank
there is a chance that something de
cisive may occur before, winter.

England has issued, during the
week, an order in Council in which
she states her intentions and that
of her allies to use their war rights
on the sea, only in accordance with
international law. Thus far, the
the new Order in Council is a vic
tory .for the cause of international
law and the rights of neutral nations.
Several of the rules in England's
new Order in Council, to serve aa
the basis for action in the future on
the sea, are rather radical depart
ures from the rules of international
law as held in the past. For in
stance, ships carrying contraband
articles are assumed to be heading
for enemy destination unless they
can prove the contrary. The bur
den of proof has always been on the
other side before. Neutral nations
can hardly agree to this change and
some others of a similar character.
Lloyd George who has proved so
able a man in every office which he
has filled, is now .called to take
charge of the Department of War in
the English Cabinet Both Lloyd
George and Robertson, the head of
UTe Army, are men who have work
ed their way up to their present
positions from humble positions in
life. This shows the triumph of
pure merit in a country where birth
counts so much.
