The above list of business firms
have agreed to close from 3 till 4:3
p ni on Fridays in order that all
who want to may have the privi
.ege nf attending the ball tf lines
between the team- of oar Sunday
Schools Nearly every body who
was asked to close agreed to do so
very willingly, and one party seem
ed u little displeased at not being
asked to close There was no in
trntiun on the part of those wtio
made the canvass to neglect any
one It is easy to forget some one.
But we want every one who will
to close and if possible to attend
the games. If all goes well we
promise you more fun in an hour
and a half than you could have in
any way in a day. The closing last
Friday mut have been very uearl y
unanimous from the large crjwd
that attended the game. You can
see by carefully studying the list
of names that it must have been
nearly unanimous. And we hope
that even the very few who refused
I to close changed their minds and
hut up for the hour a-nl a half N
question hut that we have a set of
the best business men in the coun
try, and we cm surely all agree tt
enjoy ourselves together for an hour
and a half once a week during the
ball game season. To our farmer
friends we want them to come, and
if possible attend the games If you
are just too busy to come to the
games, please do not feel sore ut
the man with whom you trade if
you find his place closed for a few
minutes He would not put you out
for any thing but he has a lot of
people here in town too who want j
him to give his clerks and help a
chance for a little recreation Let
