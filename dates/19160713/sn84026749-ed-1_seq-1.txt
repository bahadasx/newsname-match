"We should make it possible to

It developed today that Stillwcll had

A seven-and-onc-half-foot sharK,
weighing 350 pounds, waa captured three
miles off Beabright, N, J., after a stiff
fight and brought to Sheepshead Bay
today by the crow of the sloop R. C.
Lundy.
The shark grabbed one of the sloop s
fishing hooks and started to run. All
hands hauled on tho lino while tho
shark thrashed about viciously until ho
was killed with an ax. No ono ven
tured an opinion as to whether it was
a man-cater.
Tells Dramatic Story.
' Just before his death. Fisher, who Is
a strong swimmer, told surgeons a dra
matic story of his struggle with tho sea
rover and of StlllweU'a death. He de
clared the shark was fully eight feet
long, and said that the fish must have
torn the bodv of Stillwcll to pieces. At
any rate fishermen who spent all yes
terday afternoon And most of the night
dragging the creek for tho body of the
first victim could find not trace cf It.
Huge nets were cast for the shark, but

It was shortly after S o'clock when
Stillwcll, accompanied by Johnson Car

a swim. They did so without the least
fear, for sharks were never before
known to Invade the creek. They wero

Lunar Rays Affect Woman, Asserts
Attorney "All Moonshine,"
Says Psychologist.
PHILADELPHIA, July 13.-Lord By

having a devilish Influence upon young
lovers, but here's a Philadelphia law
yer who goes the poet ono better. This
lawer, A. U. Got don Davis, appeared
In the central pollco court yesterday,
nnd succeeded ln convincing an unim
pressionable magistrate that his client,
Mrs. Annte Weysberg, was suffering
from the detrimental effects of lunar
rays when she entered department
stores and appropriated sklrtH, tin pans,
and numerous other small articles.
According to detectives, the womnn
had been -jcen taking articles from
counters on at least three previous oc
casion. "All moonshine," said Davis.
The lawyer was veiy earnest In his
assertions that he wub not using any
"Littlo Man from Egypt" or "Green
Imp" defense. Ho offered to provo his
enso by the nld of science. He told the
magistrate tnnt at mis season or year
Mrs. Davis, who lives at U03 Gray's
avenue, usually was affected by the
beaming of the moon.
"The moon." sold Davis, "makes Mrs.
Weysberg a kleptomaniac. It induces
her to pick up articles small enougn
to go Into her handbag. Sho has no
motive In hor actions. She is simply suf

That latter captured tho Magistrate.
"Discharged," ho said.
Dr. Hbwurd A. Sutton, of 31 South lBth
serett, who Is associated with Dr. J.
Madison Taylor, a emlet peychologlst,
was asked to express an opinion on this
peculiar caso.
"To consider It seriously," said Doc

Committee on Appropriations

GENEROUS IN ESTIMATES
Real Fight to Come in Confer

the Possibilities.
The half-and-half principle is
maintained in the District of Co

cided on today by the Senate Ap

Standing out against the House
plan to knife the half-and-half, the
Approbations Committee has
made up the bill in accordance
with the time-honored policy
whereby the District bears half the
expense and the General Govern
ment a like proportion.
Not only has the Appropriations
Committee maintained the half
and half idea, but it has gone furl
ther and added largely to the total
of the bill. -

posed for the National Capital, and- tha

Action of the committee In favoring
the half-and-half principle was expected.
The subcommittee report to the main

ing, was In favor of It. This, however,
by no means settles' the fight for tho
half-and-half.
It Is expected the Senate will stand
by the committee, but the real atrugglo
will come In conference. House members
say the House will Insist on Wiping out
