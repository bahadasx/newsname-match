Laks City, July 12:?Ths crops in
this section are excellent so far. The
writer has heard several men say
that they never saw setter prospects
for rood harvests. Of course bad
' seasons may change the outlook, but
unless something happens after this, j
those who planted this year in this 1
community will have their labors rewarded
in so far as yield is conern
ed. We all know that when it comes!
to reducing: the money crops to cur- j
rsncy those who make their crops |
will receive but little for them. The j
speculators and financiers, who are J
the worst criminals of the nation, j
will see to that.
Mrs H V Eppsand children are on j
Sullivan's Island, spending somei
weeks. MrEppsgoes down Sundays.
Mr L A Winston has bought a
house and lot at Mvrtle Beach. This
will hereafter be the family summer
home. If this place were more easily
accessible.it would be the most popular
resort anywhere along thiscoast. i

Monday on a fishinr trip. Dr B W

upon reaching Georgetown and carried
them in a launch about 18milesj

Editor County Record:?
In reference to the article in the
last issue of your paper concerning
the enterprise of bridging the Santee
river, I desire to call ths public
attention of our citizens to the importance
of such a proposition and
to the initiatory steps which are now
being taken to ascertain whether or
not the enterprise can be successfully
undertaken at this time.
To bridge the Santee river,thereby
connecting Charleston's social and
great commercial interests directly
? *A?r,ir?!,ll? /]Ai?nlArtirtn> Poa T)PD
! WJin uit* in^iiuijr uciciu^iu^ ? v?,
section of the State, and the uniting
of the interests of the great counties
south of the Santee with those of
the counties north of it has been the
dream of the leaders since the pioneer
days of Carolina, and therefore
i just this suggestion as to its impor1
tance is sufficient.
1 The question of the bridge and its
i location has often been raised, but
perhaps never before with such sanguine
prospects for its realization as
when injected into the discussion of
good roads and State highways at a
meeting in Charleston July 3, held
under 'he auipices of the citv's
- - i
I Chamber of Commerce.
Heretofore whenever this subjeet j
was raised it either ended in discus- j
j lion or died with the enthusiasm of
I the occasion, but the real interest
that developed in the recent Charleston
meeting: indicated that the lime
is now ripe for action. It was claimed
by those present best qualified to
I make estimates that the bridge with
I proper connections for practical purposes
could be builtatacostof about
thirty or forty thousand dollars, and
the representatives in the meeting
from the counties south of the river
immediately offered the assurance
that they would raise one-half the
necessary amount if the counties
north of the river would raise the
other half, who in turn could speak
only for their communities but were;
of the opinion that the counties,
I north of the river would respond t
readily with their portion.
I
In the conference appointed for i
the purpose.it was decided after due !
consideration that, for economical
reasons,and l>ecause of the fact that
the point on the river known as the
Gourdin's.or Murray's,ferry was the
I most direct, connecting the two sections
of the State, the bridge should
be located at that place.
The Chamber of Commerce of
Charleston agreed to have export engineers
survey the swamp adjacent
to the crossing and ascertain the ap
? ? 4~ ^^ rnAtinn
proximate worn, ui mc uwivu
of the bridge at the point dssignated,
and that then Charleston would
offer to give 10 much of the total
coat of the bridge if the countiea
south and north of the river would
raiae the balance of the necessary
amount.
The propoaition ia to raiae the mo!
ney by personal aubacription and by
donations from corporations and
Boards of trade, from the National
Government and from State funds.
Bond issues are not contemplated,
and, tpeaking for Williamsburg
county, there will be no bonds. The
bridge, if built, must be constructed
by public-spirited citizens and those
most directly interested. This, however,
can be done,for it is not a Williamsburg-Berkeley
proposition only,
but involves the interest of two
great sections of the State easily able
to put the enterprise through to its
completion.
One of our citizens has already
pledged a round thousand dollars toward
the bridge, and we have heard
of two others who, each, have promised
five hundred dollars.
The big packing house now being

Let ui be thinking this bridge

when the opportunity comes, we

Washington, July 10:--Living up
to its reputation as the greatest single
factor for peace in America, the
United States marine corps,with the
loss of a few men killed and wounded,has
quietly and effectually quelled
the latest revolt in Santo Domingo,
and, without time los?, in undue parley,
has forced the rebel chieftains to
lay down their arms and return to
peaceful pursuits, according to late
advices from Monte Christi.
Uniled States marines now control
the entire island on which Haiti and
Santo Domingo are situated,and that
control was gained without serious
fighting or great loss of life, it is
claimed, because of the thorough
preparedness of the marines for the
business at hand and their knowledge
of the people and their ways.
