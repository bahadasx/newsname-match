The undersigned established
this paper Jan. 1, 1890, and for
eighteen years and eight months
was its publisher. Sept. 8, 1914
the paper was sold to MrM. P.
O'Marfti who has since been its
guiding star, and has made' a suc
cess of it.
"Mr. O'Mara is going to Ohio to
accept al more Tretnunerative posi
tion, arid we are "back on the
job." The readers of The Times
all know us. We are the same
in principle aB formerly; a free
thinker and outspoken, having no
secrets and ever favoring an
equitable division of spoils, and
an unqualified rule of the people
by their humble selves. Striving
for these principles, in addition
to furnishing our readers with all
the local news we can gather
while at hard work, we hope to
furnish The Times' readers some
thing worth their while to read.

To Shortly Return Home.

county. Hero is whore we need
a few Yankees.

Losing Flesh in Florida.
F. G. Oonlee, who spent the
winter at Gasparilla, Florida,
was' in town this week, having
recently returned 'from the. Land
of Flowers. Some of his friends
remarked that he looked just a
bit thinner than when he1 left
here last fall, and in trying to
account for it, they fiud that his
falling-off was caused, not by
that climate and'eountry, but by
the continued exertion of pulling
out the twenty-five to forty
pound fish that took his hook,
day after day, on the sea shore
along the coast at Arcadia. Mr.
Conlee, himself, admits that a
man who loves fishing would
rather be poor than to miss the
pull of a forty-pounder.
Our Little Reporter.
Everything was still but the
clicking of the types, Wednesday
afternoon, when a curley-haired,
robust, fine little fellow, sprang
with a bound into the office with
a quick, insistant call, "Mr. Ma
ra! Mr. Mara!" Mr. O'Mara was
in, and answered, and the child
instantly and proudly announced
"I've got me a little sister, Mr.
Mara!" and, having in that way
got his big piece of news in The.
Times, away he went to tell his
grandpa Eaton. He was W. T.
McGuire's little son, Walter.
