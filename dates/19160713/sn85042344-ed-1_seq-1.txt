ACTION IN LINE WITH

Strengthening of Patrol Is
Well Under Way.

SAN AXTdXIO, Texas. July 12.
Army officers here were con
vinced today that tlie ceiming of Hen.
Tasker II. litiss, asistant chief of
staff, would result in an organization
i.f the national guanlsmen into tacti
cal units. Fifty thousand of the state
troops now are at or near tho border,
liut with the exceptions of the divi
sions from New York and Pennsyl
vanla, the big addition to the federal
army is listed in units from brigades
to companies. General Hhss will
make a careful study of this new
branch of the service, and It is be
lched, will supervise the tonccnlra
llon of the scattered units on a divl
blonal basis.
Such action Is In line with the sug
ircstinn of Hemeral Funston, who rec
ommended to the war department a
few weeks ago the division of his big
border command Into three part
each part to be commanded by a
ma jor-freneral. Ilis explanation of
Ibis suggestion at the time was that
major operations south of the border
would make necessary divisional com
mands. The adoption of his sugges
tion left In the three departments
named large numbers of truardsmen
Improperly divided and there was tec
ognized Immediately the advisability
of a more thorough organization.
Thousands to Come.
General Funston and his staff have
yet the eilrectle n of tho forces along
the entire border, due to a suspension
of the order of division. Vnder the
direction of headquarters here the
guardsmen have been routed to their
stations and encamped nnd drilling Is
well under way, but the thousands
that yet are to come emphasized tho
desirability of extending throughout
the army to both guardsmen and reg
ulars tnteirnl formation.
The strengthening of the border
patrols. esH!clally that In the Biff
Rend district, was well under way to
day. Two battalions of squadron of
Texas cavalry now at I.reelo were
prepared to move to Marathon from
where, they will be sent to the Rio
Grande. Four companies of engineers
were sent to lirownsvillo, Ijiredo and
Kegle hsh. A searchlight company,
one of the army's more recent acquisi
tions, also left for border service to
day. Reports from General Pershing
and from commanding officers along
the border indicated no material
changes in tho International relations.
LYON TAKES ISSUE

8p.e;ial to The World
OKLAHOMA CITY, July 12. The
Oklahoma county disttleit court
this ovenlng again directed Secretary
of State J. L. Lyon to send papmhlets
and arguments to voters. The order
of the court followed another manda
mus application of Campbell Rusmrt.
An order of the court several davs

lists of which have been received
within the past few days. Pamphlets
have now been sent to 25 counties.
While the order ef tho court today
"will be followed, Secretary Lyon will
take the whole matter to the supreme
court, where all issues raised receive
a Vorough test.
"uints raised In Lyons answer to
the mandamus action may involve tht
validity of some of the state questions
to be submitted at the primary. Ke
sistance to mandamus Is supported by
the contention that tho pamphlets ore

arguments. Matter appears In the
arguments that was not submitted to
the secretary until after the state
board of affairs took charge of the
job and had the printing done, it is
claimed. .Finally, it is claimed. the
whole job was taken out of the hands
of the secretary of state by the board
of afafirs. These things are con
tained in the showing that will be
submitted to tho supreme court.
In passing on the case this evening-
J eel go Ilayson of the district court said
that If tho validity of any of the Ques

by the fecretsry of stato might fur

"Why," said a promlent citizen of

police department automobiles bo per
mitted to break all speed laws on the
city streets when private citizens must
obey them .'
"1 have been reading recently," he
went on, "where many cities In the
east have adopted rule:s, requiring fire

at not more than ten miles an hour,
and in some cases eight miles is the
limit. We e-ertsilnly need such regula

Even the motorcycle oops travel too
fast. They use bright searchlights

always travel at break-neck speed,
which is entirely useless.
"The fire department should not go
faster than 15 miles un hour, even
when answering an alarm. At that
rate they can reach any section of the

WASHINGTON, July 12. Tho

Whether a i-haem or a new and well

The first ilw of bl'ickjde. th

that the blockading forces must be
