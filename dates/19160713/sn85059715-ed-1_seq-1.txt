Teutons Bring Up Reinforcements
in Desperate Efforts
to Retain Kovel.
(BY ASSOCIATED PRESS)
LONDON, July IJ.?Fighting continues
Ht various points along the
battle front in the region of the
Somme but there has been no change
in the situation on any p>art of the
British line, says jui otllcial statement
issued Thursday. Attempts of the
. Annans to raid trenches west of
Wyscliaete and south of laiBasse
canal were frustrated.
(BY ASSOCIATED PBCSSl
LOX'DOX, July 1.1?The recovery of
the Russian army since their defeats
of last year and the apparently inexhaustible
supply of guns and ammunition
with which they are provided continues
to be a source of wonder to military
writers. At least six great armies
are engaged against the Austrians
and Germans on Russia's western
front. All of them are using great
(Jfcntities of ammunition.
Turks Driven Rack.
The forces under Grand Duke iXicholas
in Armenia and Persia have been
fighting vigorously against the Turks
for months. A few weeks ago parts
of these forces, particularly those
west of Erzerum, were compelled to
fall back in .the faco of a stronger
[ Turkish army. Early this week the
(grand duke resumed the offensive in
this region and recaptured Mamakhatum,
fifty miles west of Erzerum, so
that the Turks have fallen back from
twenty-five miles front the farthest
point reached in their counter offensive.
Meanwhile the armies directly south
of the Pinsk marshes are lighting a
pitched battle with the Austro-German
forces of General von J.insingen along

probably will be some days before the
decision is reached as the Teutons
i have brought up very strong re-cnwSt
forcements in the hope of retaining
possession of Kovel, loss of which
would necessitate a regrouping over
a long stretch of the front. North
of the Pinsk marshes the fighting at
present is largely with artillery. In
flalieia the Russian armies are reforming
for continuation of the offensive.
Seventh Ureal Onslaught.
Jn tne we?i tne reneweu euuns m
the German crown prince at Verdun
temporarily are taking precedence in
ihc public mind over the battle of
the Somme. The attack just delivered
h.v the Germans before Verdun is the
seventh great onslaught with dense
masses of troops since the operations
began five months ago. The Germans
have made a slight gain but apparently
this has not lessened the confidence
of the French in their ability
to hold fast- They still have three
solid lines of defenses which must be
penetrated before the German objective
can he gained.
The British are still engaged tn
clearing the Germans front fortified
positions which must be taken before
the general offensive can be renewed.
