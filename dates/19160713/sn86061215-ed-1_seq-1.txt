I London, July 12.—The Dally News
•ays the British government is dis
posed to take a serious view of the
•tatus of the Oermal submarine
Deutschland. The official opinion is
eaid to be that under existing circum
stances a submarine can not be
classed as a merchant vessel at all.
The unofficial view is that the sub
marine should be sunk on sight.
"The American government face*
ft now and delicate problem which
adds one more to the already numer
ous points on which a decision after
the wnr will be imperative," the News
continues.
"Even if a submarine merchantman
can prove herself to be really un
armed. the difficulties of supervising
such a craft, even in harbor, must be
almost insuperable for the friendly
neutral. If such a vessel chose, it is
fairly clear she might, with the ad
vantages she possesses, most grossly
abuse the hospitality extended to her."
SAILING TIME SECRET.
Washington, D. C., July
CARGO BEING LOADED.
Baltimore, Md., July 12.—-Confident
that the state department at Wash
ington will sustain the findings of the
treasury and naval officials that the
Deutschland is a merchant ship and
therefore entitled to all the privileges
dut to a belligerent owned freighter
tinder international law, the agents of
the supersubmersible today went
ahead with their plans for disposing
of the vessel's cargo and preparations
for the return voyage.
It is known that the Deutschland
will Vtake aboard a cargo of rubber
and nickel. Her captain said he ex
pected to sail "within ten days."
Already there is discussion con
cerning the return cargoes for other
underwater liners which are expected
to follow the Deutschland to American
shores. These vessels, it was reli
ably stated, will carry back the most
essential foodstuffs that Germany and
Austria-Hungary need. Coffee was
specifically named as one of the com
modities. It was also declared that
the Bremen, constructed by the same
company that built the Deutschland
and reported.from Berlin last night as
about to sail, will carry drugs that are
much needed in this country and
which can not be obtained from any
other than German sources.
Many Seek Passage.
The North Gertaan-Lloyd line has re
ceived from persons in all parts of the
country offers running as high as $50
000 for the privilege of taking passage
on the submarine on her return trip.
A
representative of the company said
today, however, that no passengers
Will be carried.
"Most of the offers were from Amer
icans," he said. "Scores offered be
tween $1,000 and $5,000."
The unloading of the Deutschland
may be completed tonight
The fact that the tug Thomas F.
Timmins went into drydock today for
repairs gave rise to rumors that she
was getting ready to return to the Vir
ginia capes to convoy into the Chesa
peake, as she did the Deutschland, the
submarine Bremen, which is reported
on her way.
It was thought on the other hand
that the tug's first duty would be to
escort the Deutschland back to the
capes. It was intimated today at the
.North German-Lloyd offices that the
Deutschland might drop anchor sever
al days at Norfolk and wait for the
most favorable opportunity to slip out
to sea.
WILSON TO MAKE
PERSONAL PLEA
Washington, D. C., July 12.—Presi
dent Wilson today told a large dele
gation of representatives of Polish
organizations that he would make per
sonal efforts to get relief to the starv
ing in Poland. It is understood he is
considering a personal appeal to the
rulfers of the nations involved to allow
distribution of food. The state de
partment already has made one such
appeal.

submarine and reported she is an un
armed merchant ship probably will
be made public by the state depart
ment tomorrow.

III OFFENSIVE
BRITONS WAIT FOR THE NEXT
BIQ DRIVE TO BE INSTITUTED
BY GEN HAIGL
London, July 12.—Although the ex
tent of ground which has been gained
by the British offensive is not great,
there is general satisfaction in Eng
land at the success attained by the
army
of Gen. Halg during the twelve
days of fighting and the belief exists
that the advantageous positions now
occupied will make possible greater
achievements.
The capture of Contailmason, Mete
and Tron©8 woods gives the British a
line running almost due east and west,
BO
that the Germans to the north can
be attacked on the flank when the
guns are brought up for the second
phase of the operations. To the south
of the river the French are in a posi
tion somewhat similar to the British
and likewise can attack the German
flank south of
Belloy
German troops on the right bank of
the river Meuse yesterday pushed for
ward their positions to a point nearer
Souville and the Laufee works, taking
thirty-nine officers and 2,106 men, says
the official statement Issued today by
the German army headquarters staff.
WAR SUMMARY.
German resistance to the British of
fensive along the Somme front took
the form last night of strong counter
attacks which at two points made
dents in the line established by Gen.
Haig's army. Heavily reinforced,
the Germans made a determined drive
at the British front. According tolthe
British, all attacks were futile ex
cept those directed at Mametz and
Trones woods in the Montauban sec
tor of the British right, where some
ground was gained by the German col
umns.
The French have not resumed their
offensive in the Somme region, Paris
reporting that the night there passed
quietly.
There has been notable activity in
the Verdun sector. The crown
prince's troops, after their suocess of
yesterday in Fumin wood and at the
Damloup battery where they gained
a footing, struck at the French in the
vicinity of Dead Man hill, west of
the Meuse. The attacks there
repulsed.
To the east of the Meuse the French
report having reoccupied some of the
ground lost in the Fumin wood re
gion. They also drove the Germans
out of trenches near Reillon, In Lor-
raine, where a footing had been gain-
ed and carried out further successful
surprise operations in the Champagne.
The Italian offensive has been push
ed recently, not only in the Trentino,
where the Austrians have been driven
back long distances from their far
thest points of advance, but along the
Isonzo, where Gorlzia is the objec
tive.
COLLECTOR CALLS
BRITONS TO TIME
Manila, July 12. —The collector of
customs has granted a hearing in the
case of the steamer Chinese Prince on
Thursday morning at 9 o'clock. The
steamer is still detained with the cus
toms guards In control. The British
consul will confer with the governor
general, Francis Burton Harrison, to
night before reporting the seizure of
the Chinese Prince to the British gov
ernment in London.
IOWA—Partly cloudy tonight Thuf- day fair continued warm- Bun
and Estrees. For
the moment, however, the two armies
are engaged in preparing their new
positions.
Meanwhile, the Germans, renewing
the attaoks on Verdun, have captured
Damloup battery, which they held for
a time at the beginning of June. This
position is the point furthest from
Verdun in the French line of defense,
so that its loss is not taken seriously
by the French'command.
In the east the Russians are engag
ed in heavy .battles in the extreme
northwestern portion of Bukowlna,
where they are inflicting further de
feats on the army of Gen. Pflanser,
now cut off from Gen. von Bothmex's
forces to the north and also along the
Stokhod river, where the Austrlans
and Germans are putting up formid
able resistance. The Stokhod is a
shallow river but marshes on either
side impede movements of troops and
guns.
Across the river fighting is in pro*
gress near Svidniki while to the south
east another force is advancing on
Kovel.
RUSSIANS DEFEATED.
Berlin. July 12. —Russian troops,
which attempt to establish themselves
on the left bank of the Stokhod river
in the advanoe toward Kovel, were at
tacked by German troops and defeated

Chihuahua City, Mexico, July 12.—
Plans for the Improvement of econom

foreign residents of this city. These
efforts have the support of Gen. Ja
cinto Trevino, commanding the Car
ranza army of the north, who said he
believes the solution of the problem
lies in the resumption of the opera
tion of the mines, smelters and other
Industries in the state.
In this way, he said, the govern
ment would be provided with ade
quate revenue to carry on its func
tions and that roving men who have
been forced Into a life of banditry
oould be given employment.
Foreigners, including Americans,
say the proffering of a plan which
will quickly revive the dormant in

the greatest help the American gov

by educational authorities.

that the problem is in reality one
