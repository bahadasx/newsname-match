GERMANS HAMMERING
Successes at Damloup Fattery, Followed by Strong Teutonic
Offensive Toward Fort Souville Mass Attack From
Heury Gains Ground Russian Front Was Quiet Wed
nesday Turkish Forces Are R-eating.
Fighting desperately in the face of
determined German attacks, the forces
tinder General Haig succeeded Wed
nesday in gaining control of the en
tire Mametz "Wood, which had been
entered the previous night by the
Germans. In the same region north
of i he Somme, the British made some
progress in the Trones wood and re
pulsed two heavy attacks against
Contalmaison. The Germans are re
' ported to have lost heavily in their at
tacks on Trones wood.
Quiet South of Somme.
The French and German forces
south of the Somme apparently are
resting as there has been almost no
activity in that region of Picardy
since the first of the week.
Heavy Fighting Around Verdun.
Around Verdun, however, and es
pecially on the right bank of the
Meuse, bitter and heavy fighting is in
progress between the forces if the
German crown prince and the French
defenders of the fortress. The Ger
mans, following up their success in
the region of the Damloup battery,
have undertaken a strong offensive to
ward Fort Souville, the possession of
which would strengthen their posi
tion for a further advance on Ver
dun. Germans Gain, But Losses Great.
Attacking in mass formation from
the village of Fleury and the Chapi-ti-e
and Vaux Woods, the Germans
pained trround at the. intersection of
the Fleury and Vaux roals. The
gain, however, Paris asserts, was
made at the cost o" "enormous loss
es.'' Violent bombardments continue
in the rc'iion of Souville. Chenois and
La Laufee. There was relative calm
on the left hank t.f thu JU-use.
East Front Less Active.
The fierce fighting which has mark
ed the Russian advance across the
Stokhod River toward Kovel appears
to have quieted down. Petrograd says
there has beer, fighting on this sec
tor, but mentions only two minor at
tacks by the Germans, which, it adds,
were repjiilsed. There -has been some
activity north of the Stokhod region,
but in Bukowina and Galicia the ad
vance of General BruKsilofE's troops
seems to have halted for the moment.
Russian Success in Armenia.
The Russians have met with suc
cess in Armenia and report the cap
ture of Mahakhatum, fifty miles wefjj
of Erzerum and about the same dis

the Russian drive in this direction.
The Turkish forces, in retreating from
the town, which was taken by assault,
Bet it on fire.
Vienna and Rome Both Claim Success
Fighting continues at isolated points
on the Austro-Italian front and Rome
reports some successes in the Adige
valley and the recapture in part of
positions on Monte Com There
Were artillery bombardments by both
Fides at other points on this front.
Vienna claims the repulse of a strong
Italian attack on Monte Rato, south
of the Sugana valley.
ALLIES STEADY PROGRESS
SOURCE OF SATISFACTION
Haig's Report Shows Anglo-French
Offense is Driving Determinedly
On.
London, July 12, 10:2o p. m. The
Anglo-French offense is maintaining
itself as rigorously as ever against
the most determined attacks, which
the Germans now are delivering
against the front in northern France.
The Germans have thrown reinforce
ments into the breach, having had
ample time to recover from the first
6tock and the unexpected strength of
the British and French attacks. There
is no doubt the Germans had supposed
the French to too enfeebled greatly
eouth of the Somme because of the
number of troops needed in the de
fence of Verdun against the forces of
the German crown price. The fact
the allies are progressing so method
jcally, and even against German at
tacks, gives the people of the British
nations the greatest satisfaction.
Heavy Casualities by Germans.
No events of a sensational character
on the front in northern France were
announced today but General Haig. in
a brief bulletin tonight recounts the
recovery toy the "British of all ground
lost yesterday in the Mametz Wood.
The British comanler tells also of the
repulse of two heaj-y German attacks
against Contalmaison, and of steady
progress liy his forces in the Trones
.Wood, the scene of much heavy and
desperate -fighting during the past few
days.
Incidentally. General ' ' Haig com
ments on the heavy casualties suffered
by the Germans in their attacks of
the British forces north of the Somme.
600,000 Bayonets Oppose Allies.
From General Haig's 'bulletins it is
seen that the British are driying
eteadlly towards the crest of the ridge
commanding the wide IBapaume pla
teau. According to the view of French
military experts there are no less than
,600,000 German bayonets opposing Che

PARALYSIS CULTURE
MAY CONTAIN GERM.
Dr. Simon Flexner of the Rockefeller
Institute is Working on Problem
Fewer Cases Reported.
New York, July 12. While Health
Commissioner Emerson declined to
night to discuss the report that a
New York physician had succeeded in
isolating the germ of infantile pa
ralysis, great importance was attach
ed by medical men to the meeting of
physicians tomorrow night which will
be devoted to a discussion of the dis
ease which has cost more than 250
lives in this city since the epidemic
began. Among the speakers will be
Dr. Simon Flexner of the Rockefel
ler Foundation, who is devoting his
energies to a study of infantile
paralysis. It was semi-officially ad
milted that scientists have progressed
so far that they are testing a culture
in which they believe they will find
traces of the germ fj ultimately iso
late it.
There was a feeling of optimism in
the health department today, not only
because there were fewer cases re
ported than yesterday, but also be
cause no new cases were invaded and
because all agencies combatting the
epidemic are wrorking in complete co
oiieration. Out of a total of 1,440 cases since
the epidemic developed, there have
been 2X7 deaths, it was officially an
nounced by the department of health
tonisl.'t. Should the disease spread
between now and October 1. in the
proportion of iii'eases of new cases
since July 1, it was said that the num
ber of those afflicted prooably would
rea'-h 10.000 while deaths, at the same
ratio as during the past twelve days
would total about 2,000.
Preventive Steps Milford.
Milford, Conn.. July 12. Steps were
taken by the health officials of Mil
ford today to guard against infantile
paralysis. To a summer home for
chilldren where about 175 from New
York and vicinity are now quartered
instructions kere given to receive no
further children at this time. Those
now at the home will be permitted to
stay the usual ten days and then will
ibe returned to their homes. No
eases of the disease, it was stated,
have occurred here so far.
Another Case at Yalesville.
Wallingford, Conn., July 12. Anoth
er case of infantile paralysis develop
ed at Yalesville today. The victim is
John Murphy, 11 years old, whose
young sister is now suffering from the
disease. The little girl, it was re
ported tonight, is improving. The chil
dren came to Yalesville with their
mother recently from Brooklyn, N. Y.
A number of Brooklyn children who
are" here were taken before the health
officers today aiil fumigated as a pre
cautionary measure.
Infant Dead in Hartford.
Hartford, Conn., July 12. The fif

HEROIC RESCUE TRIED
12 Year Old Lester Stillwell Apparent
ly Devoured and Stanley Fisher, 24,
Who Tried to Save Him, Fatally
Bitten Another Lad May Lose Leg.
Matawan, N. J., July 12. Lester
Stiilwell, 12 3'ears old, was killed by a
man-eating shark while bathing in an
arm ot Karitan Bay near here this I
afternoon. Stanley Fisher, 24 years
old. who went to his aid, was so badly
injured in a desperate struggle with
the nine foot sea monster that he died
while being taken to a Long Branch
hospital. Joseph Dunn, 12 years old,
bathing some distance away in the
same inlet, was attacwed by a shark
and one of his legs was so lacerated it
probably will have to be amputated.
Third Time in Two Weeks.
This is the third time within two
weeks that sharks have claimed the
lives of bathers along the New Jersey
coast, Sharles E. Van Sant, a youth
of Philadelphia, was knlled by one off
Beach Haven, N. J., on July 2. Charles
Bruder of Spring Lake, N. J., was at
tacked and both his legs taken off by
a shark July 6. He died while men
who went to his rescue were carrying
him ashore.
Summer People Terror-Stricken.
The summer population along the
New Jersey coast has become terror-stricken
and few persons now are
venturing in the water at beach re
sorts which have not been protected
by steel nets. Motor boat' patrols
carrying armed men nave been es
tablished at various points to hunt
the man-eaters.
Fisher to the Rescue.
A dozen or more boys who also were
bathing in the inlet, saw young Still
well suddenly raise his hands above
the water and heard his scream for
help. A moment later he disappeared
from view.
Fisher, powerfully built and weigh
ing :ii)0 pounds, who was standing on
the bank of the inlet, leaped into the
water, to the rescue. lie had gone
only a few feet when the shark atl
tacker him, tearing a piece out of one
thigh.
Shark Snapped Off Leg.
In spite of his wound Fisher battled
vyith the shark and kept on until he
reached young Stillwell. He caught
the boy up in his arms and had start
ed for shore when the shark renewed
the attack. Burdened as he was.
Fisher was helpless and the shark
snapped off his leg. Fisher released
his hold on Stillwell and himself sank
beneath .the surface, unconscious.
Heedless of the danger, another boy
sprang into the inlet and dragged
Fisher out. No trace of young Still
well was found and it is believed he
was devoured by the shark.
Shark Was Driven Off.
The Dunn boy, according to persons
who were standing on the bank of
the inlet, also was attacked soon aft
er going into the water. An elder
brother and another boy went to his
rescue. They succeeded in driving
off the shark, but not until after the
younger Dunn's leg had been torn al
most to shreds from the knee down.
Dr. H. S. Cooley, who attended the
Dunn boy, said he probably would re
cover unless blood poisoning develop
ed. He was removed to a hospital in
New Brunswick, N. J.
Five Seen During Afternoon.
Hundreds of persons flocked to the
bank of the inlet soon after the trag
edy. The inlet is about fifty feet
wide, ten or twelve feet deep and ex
tends for a distance of several miles
from Paritan Bay. Several persons
along Raritan Bay said tonight that
they had seen the fins of a shark dur
ing the afternoon and they agreed that
it was about nine feet long.
Use of Dynamite Planned.
Efforts were made tonight to bar the
egress of the sharks to sea by
stretching a wire netting across' the
inlet where it empties into the bay and
it is probable that dynamite will be
. used to bring them to the surface.
SINKING AT SEA.
Distress Signals From Steamship Ra
mos Picked Uy By Wireless.
New York, July 12. Distress sig
nals from the steamship Ramos re
porting that her engines were disabled
and that she was sinking 310 miles
northwest of Watling's Island were

AN AIR OF MYSTERY
Clearance Papers May Not be Made
Public Advice of Neutrality Beard
to be Sought Before Final Ruling
on Status as Merchantman.
Baltimore, Md., July 12. That
plans were afoot rapidly to re-load
the super-submersible Deutschland
and slip her out speedily on her re
turn voyage to Germany was indicat
ed tonight. A special permit was ob
tained for oontinuing the unloading of
the vessel tonight and it -vas ex
pected that she would be ready by
dawn tomorrow to begin taking on a
cariro of nickel and rubber.
No one in authority woud say when
the vessel would depart and the only
positive statement in that connection
was contained in Captain Koenig's
declaration to the local customs offi
cers that he expected to sail "within
ten days." The tug Thomas F. Tim
mons completed repairs today ana
took up a position in front of the
Deutschland. When the Timmons
entered drydock it was reported that
phe was getting ready to return to
the Virgina capes to convoy into the
Chesapeake, as she did the Deutsch
land, the submarine 'Bremen which is
said to be four days on her way to
this country.
Air of Mystery Deepens.
The air of mystery surrounding all
discussion of the Deaitschland's de
parture was deepened today by re
ports that her clearance papers may
uot bo made public when filed, thus
preventing advance notice of her
leaving beng obtained.
It became known late today that
several conferences have been held
here between representatives of the
Ocean Navigation 'Company and of the
Krupp Steel Company and Simon
Lake, inventor of the submarine. This
gave rise to a report that a company
was in course of formation for the
purpose of carrying on undersea com
merce, between the United States and
Germany and that Mr. Lake had been
invited to accept the position of con
sulting engineer.
While no official announcement
could be obtained from Paul G. L. Hil
ken, the American representative of
the ' sinbmarine interests, it is under
stood that plans for the new venture
will ite sent back to Germany on the
Deutschland. Mr. Lake is said to have
-eache da satisfactory agreement with
the owners of the Deutschland and to
have abandoned any intention of lib
elling the vessel. He left for Bridge
port, Conn., tonight and is expect
ed to return to this city in a few days.
GOVERNMENT RULING
OUT TODAY
Various Troublesome Questions Have
Been Raised By Deutschland.
Washington. July 12. Although
state department officials virtually
are convinced that the German sub
marine Deutschland is strictly a mer
chant vessel, the advice of the neu
trality board probably will be sought
before a final ruling is made.
Acting Secretary Polk indicated to
day that the ruling would not be de
laved long and it may be announced
tomorrow. It is understood he con
siders that there is nothing lacking
to establish the Deaitschland's sta
tus as a peaceful merchantman and
desires to consult the neutrality board
only in order to give added weight to
the denartment's formal decision.
The detailed report of Collector
Ryan at Baltimore, holding that the
submarine could not be converted in
to a war vessel without "extensive
structural changes" was forwarded by
the treasury department today to Mr.
Polk. It probably will be made pub-,
lie tomorrow.
Rumors of Neutral Convoy.
Diplomats of the allied countries
received information during the day
indicating that the Deutschland was
convoyed from Bremen almost to the
Chesapeake Capes by a neutral mer
chantman, presumably Norwegian,
Swedish or Dutch, which aided in
shielding her from detection by en
emy warship and also acted as a
tender. This information may be
communicated later to the state de
partment and an investigation re
quested. Allied warships are said
now to be searching for the convoy
ship.
Various rumors indicating that the
submarine might have had a convoy
have reached the state department,
but none of them ever was given
credence. One was that a British
steamer which put into the Madeira
Islands had sighted on June 23 in the
Atlantic a large submarine bound
eastward in convoy of a steamer.
The state department already has
begun consideration of questions in
volving departure of the Deutschland
To prevent violation of neutrality by
forwarding of military information
from this country regarding the
Deutschland's movements, officials
are considering whether the govern
ment should prevent dissemination of
news of her sailing.
Other troublesome Questions prob
ably will arise from the visit of the
Deutschland. officials realize, but they
will be considered as they develop.
Interest in reports that other Ger
man merchant submarine may visit
the United States was indicated by a
despatch sent by the department to
day to the American consul at Bre
men, inquiring why he did not con
fidentially advise the Washington
government of the sailing of the
Deutschland.

bitionists." If Mr. Ford declines to become a
candidate, the leaders declare that the
choice will be between J. Frank Han
ly, former governor of Indiana; Eu
gene N. Foss, former governor of
Massachusetts, and William Sulzer,
former governor of New York.

planks endorsing the following propo- '
sitions:
