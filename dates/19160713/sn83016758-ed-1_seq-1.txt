BOUND FOR BORDER
Company With Balance of the Third
Regiment Speeding South Over
Chicago-Great Western.
'Mike" Writes Interstingly of the
partureNumerous Visitors Bid
the Boys Godspeed.
July 10, 1916, 5 P. M.
On board train headed for "some
where along the border."
At last it has actually happened
and Company with the balance of
the Third regiment are speeding
towards the border on the Chicago-
Great Western. The regiment left
Fort Snelling this morning in three
sections, Company being in the
third and last section as Major Cas
"well is the junior major. The other
two sections are one and two hours
ahead of us, respectively.
Sunday afternoon it became very
apparent that something was going to
happen right away as the companies
of the Third were ordered to strike
and pack their large pyramidal tents
and pitch their "pup" tents for use
Sunday night. All camp equipment
except that actually carried by the
men was also packed and mado ready
for shipment. From this it was easy
to gather that things would be doing
bright and nearly Monday morning.
And sure enough they were. For
right after breakfast the word came
down the line to pack up and get ready
to entrain and by 1:30 p. m. the third
section of the regiment was pulling
out of Foit Snelling for the border (as
we all now believe).
The Third pulled out amid the com
bined cheers of the First and Second
regiments, which have to wait until
they are "reasonably ready" before
they entrain for the border. Just be
fore the first battalion pulled out the
Second regiment band headed a parade
of farewell down the Third regiment
street and goodbyes and Godspeeds
were passed along to the officers and
men of the departing regrment from
their envious brother officers and men
of the two regiments remaining in
camp.
Several eleventh hour visitors were
on hand Monday morning to bid the
Rum river valley boys goodbye,
among whom were included the fol
lowing: A. G. Osterberg, H. Caley,
Mrs. C. F. J. Goebel and A. C. Wilkes.
Owing to the various rumors as to
when the boys were going to leave the
camp has been full of visitors for the
last week. The official visitors' book
got lost in the general mixup of break
ing camp and there is now no record
of who they were or just when they
/\vere there. Sufficient to say that the
boys all appreciated the good will
shown and will remember for many a
long day the good people of Princeton
and Milaca and the adjoining country
who showed their interest in and well
wishes for the boys of Company
by calling on them while they were
in camp.
Mrs. C. F. J. Goebel was the last
vistor in camp. Just before the boys
marched down to the station she went
down the line and bid the boys all
goodbye just as'if she was the mother
of them all and there was hardly a
dry eye left in the company when she
had bid goodbye and Godspeed to the
last man of them. A. C. Wilkes was
also on deck to say the last farewell as
the boys entrained at the Fort Snelling
station. From that on the company
will be practically among total
strangers.
Following is the official roster of
the company as it now stands:

Company Reduced to 65.
Company G, M. N. G., which left
Princeton 76 strong, was made up of
65 men when it entrained for the bor
der. Nine members of the company
failed to pass the federal medical ex
amination, viz: E. Godbout, Arthur
Roos, Sam Shaw, Henry Olson, Emil
Bandemer, Geo. Chandler and Ed.
Anderson.
Two of the boys of Company
were given leave of absence for a
couple of days last week and failed
to return to the camp at Fort Snelling
before the regiment left for the front
on Monday. One of the boys is a resi
dent of Princeton township and the
other's home is at Milaca. The boys,
unwittingly perhaps, are guilty of a
very serious offense, and their friends
should so advise them. Just what the
penalty for desertion is after a soldier
has been mustered into the service of
the United States we do not know,
but we do know that it is quite severe.
The boys will not be posted as de
serters until 10 days have elapsed, and
it is to be hoped that they will get in
touch with the company within that
time.
HIGHW AY HYPOCRISY."
The Paid Tools of the Bridge Com
bine Placed in a Bad Light.
One or two nondescript newspapers
in the state, edited and owned by
chronic grouches, have given circula
tion to the balderdash contained in a
circular recently issued by the so
called "Minnesota Highway Home Rule
Association."
The president of this alleged asso
ciation, E. G. Eklund of Fosston, is an
ex-county commissioner of Polk coun
ty, and at the recent primary election
he was a candidate for the legislature
and the main plank in his platform
was the abolition of the State High
way Commission. There were seven
candidates and only two to be nomi
nated. When the votes were counted
Mr. Eklund was seventh on the list.
The hard-headed farmers of Polk
county would have none of him. The
miserable showing he made at the
polls shows what the people of Polk
county think of him.
While county commissioner of Polk
county we presume the bridge con
tractors found Mr. Eklund a pleasant
gentleman to do business with. But
the voters of Polk county evidently
have had enough of him, at any rate
he will not represent the interests of
the "bridge combine" in the next legis
lature.
Anent the circular entitled "High
way Hypocrisy" the subjoined article
from the St. Cloud Journal-Press is
highly interestingit goes to show
that the name of County Commis
sioner Lahr of Stearns county was
attached to the screed without his
knowledge or consent:
"The Home Rule association some
time ago issued a circular which con
tained a statement headed Highway
Hypocrisy, being an attack on the
state highway commission, and to
which the name of Peter N. Lahr,
chairman of the Stearns county com
misisoners, was attached. The Min
nesota Highway Journal, the offi
cial publication of the highway com
mission, contains an affidavit from
Mr. Lahr in which he says under oath
that he never signed any such state
ment, and that his name was attached
without his authority or consent. Au
ditor Thomey also made a statement
that the article was not signed by Mr.
Lahr or any other member of the
board. The article purposed to give
a statement of the alleged differences
between the state and the county
boards. The Home Rule association
is reported to be making a statewide
fight against the highway commission
plan, and wants the state money
turned over to the town authorities.
We do not believe the Stearns county
commissioners would approve of that
plan, which was in force in Minnesota
for many years, and which did not
produce good roads."St. Cloud Jour-
nalPress, July l, 1916.
Watertown Wins.
Just about the wooziest exhibition
of baseball ever staged in these parts
was viewed by a fair-sized gathering
of fans at the fair grounds Sunday,
when the Watertown. and' Princeton
ball teams staged a comedy of errors.
(It was either a comedy or a crime, we
know not which.) After struggling.
R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, JULY 13,1916.
through nine, long, weary innings the
visitors had the long end of a 13 to
12 count. This was Princeton's first
defeat this season.
Princeton did not have its regular
line-up. Three of the star performers
Wilkes, Doane and Smithare with
Co. speeding to the border.
Nevitt was on the hill top for
Princeton and the "Chief" was in
splendid'formfor bench duty. Wild
ness was his "chief" fault, although
when he did get the ball over the plate
the visiting willow wielders bumped
it not infrequently. Jesmer relieved
Nevitt in the eighth round and got
by in good shape. Skahen was behind
the bat, and aside from his scintillat
ing defensive work was a tower of
strength on the offensive. He made
six trips to the plate and smote the
horsehide faiu, and square five times,
and upon the other occasion he walked.
G. Boylon and H. VanKrevelen were
in the points for the Carver county
nastimers.
The locals got away to a three run
lead in their half of the first inning,
after blanking their opponents. Three
hits, a base on balls, and a fielder's
choice enabled Skahen, Berg and Caley
to count.
The second stanza was filled with
waters of bitterness for the local fans.
The harrowing details need not be en
tered into. Suffice it to say that
seven of the visitors shagged their
way across the plate. Princeton came
right back in its half and evened up
the count. A corking double off of
Jesmer's bat, Skahen's single followed
by a smoking triple off of Berg's
bludgeon, combined with a base on
balls and an error, gave Princeton
five runs.
Watertown was blanked in the third
but Princeton grabbed a lead of one
in its half, when Raiche traveled the
paths the entire distance.
Princeton increased its lead in the
fourth, after holding the opposition
scoreless again, when Mallette drove
out a double and later counted.
The margin between the teams nar
rowed in the fifth, when the visitors
pushed one run over and then blanked
Princeton.
Neither side counted in the sixth,
but Watertown forged into the lead in
the next round, when three of the
visitors ambled around the cireait
Princeton was blanked in its half.
Jesmer relieved Nevitt in the eighth,
but a combination of unfortunate cir
cumstances gave the Carver county
men another run. The locals made
the count 12 to 12 in their half, by
adding two runs to their total. Staples
and Raich counted. Angstman also
completed the circuit but was called
ou' at the plate on a decision that was
mare than questionable.
With the score a tie considerable in
terest was manifested in the ninth
frame. One of the Watertown ath
letes managed to worry his way over
the paths from the batter's box all
the way round, back to home base,
and it proved to be the winning run.
Princeton was blanked in its half, al
though Skahen, first up, reached sec
ond before anyone was retired.
NOTES.
Verily, it was one punk game.
The locals thumped Boylan's offer
ings for ten safe blows.
"Pongo" Olson was fortunate
enough to miss the game. He was
visiting at Mille Lacs lake.
There was not a great deal of credit
in winning this particular game, but
to lose it was worse yet.
Nevitt has pitched good ball for
Princeton in the past, but he was de
cidedly off Sunday. They all have an
off day.
The umpiring end was attended to
by H. J. Plaas and Harry Bradford.
Princeton did not get the best of it
by any means.
Staples of Elk River was with the
locals and performed well. He proved
the equal of Billy Doane in waiting
a pitcher out, and secured four walks
out of five trips to the plate.
Dr. and Mrs. Peterson Entertain.
The Swedish Lutheran Ministerial
association of the Minneapolis and St.
Paul districts was entertained at the
West hotel, Minneapolis, Monday aft
ernoon at 3 o'clock by Dr. and Mrs.
M. Peterson of Princeton. Dr. L. F.
Johnson, president of the Swedish
Lutheran church of North America,
was in attendance and read a paper
that was interesting, instructive and
inspiring. The affair was a success
from every point of view, as all who
are acquainted with the host and
hostess know. Dr. Peterson informs
us that it was his original intention to
entertain the association here, but
train service made the plan imprac
ticable.

COUNTY DADS MEET
In Regular Semi-Annual Session at
the County Auditor's Office
Monday and Tuesday.
Numerous School Petitions Presented
Taxes in the Amount of $38,500
Levied for Ensuing Year.
The board of county commissioners
met in regular semi-annual session at
the office of the county auditor Mon
day and Tuesday. All members were
present, and Chairman Cater presided.
The list of names of persons to be
added to original list of grand and
petit jurors selected at the annual
meeting,in place of those names retired
from said list at the March, 1916, term
of court, were selected by the county
commissioners.
The petitions of John Berg and
others, George H. Smallwod and
others, John Swanson- and others, and
Charlie Nord and others, asking for
the formation of new school districts,
one of which will be a joint district,
came up for consideration, but no
definite action was taken. Upon mo
tion made,-seconded and carried the
petitions were laid over until the next
meeting of the board which will be
held on August 15. This will give the
^Kanabec county commissioners time to
act on the joint petition.as part of the
territory of the proposed district lies
in Kanabec county.
The list of uncollected personal
property taxes was revised, and sev
eral items were cancelled as uncol
lectible. Citations were ordered is
sued against those remaining on the
list.
A petition was presented to the
board from John M. Schelin and others
asking for the formation of a new
school district from territory in the
towns of Borgholm and Hayland.
August 15, 1916, was designated as
the date of hearing on said petition.
E. W. Goff and others presented a
petition to the board asking for the
formation of a new school district out
of territory in the town of Hayland,
and the board will hear the matter tm
August 15, 1916. ,w
August 15,19l67"was also designated
as the date of hearing on the petition
of J. A. Watson and others asking for
the formation of a new school district
out of territory in the town of Hay-
land.'
The village council of Foreston
asked the board to appropriate all the
money paid into the county road and
bridge fund from that village during
the years 1916 and 1917 and the two
preceding years to be used to aid in
the construction of a bridge over the
west branch of the Rum river on the
section line between sections 33 and 34
of township 38, range 27. On motion
the petition was laid over.
On motion duly made and seconded
the following amounts were unani
mously voted to be levied on the tax
able property for the ensuing fiscal
year, the same being based on the ex
penses of the county for the past year
as reported by the county auditor:
Revenue $22,000
Road and bridge 13,500
Poor farm 1,000
County poor 2,000
total levy $38,500
The commissioners made their reg
ular examination of the county treas
urer's office, and after acting on the
usual grist of bills, adjourned. The
next meeting will be held on
August 15.
Not Fond of Tough Meat.
"They eat like cannibals!" simpered
a Minneapolis damsel to her girl com
panion as they watched a couple of
hungry Company boys dispatch
their supper at Camp Bobleter one
evening last week.
Sergeant who was standing
close by, lifted.his hat and quietly
retorted: "Never fear, Miss, you are
in no danger cannibals have a weak
ness for sweet, toothsome morsels
they dislike tough meat.''
Then the sergeant beat a hasty re
treat and took refuge in a dense
grove of evergreens.
Guardsmen's Pay.
Adjutant General Wood has ruled
that members of the national guard
are entitled to only $1.50 per day. If
we, read the law aright guardsmen are
entitled to $2.00 per day from the
time they are called into active serv
ice until they are mustered into the
service of the United States, then their
pay is 50 cents per day, the same as
enlisted men in the regular army.
Section 2403 of the general statutes
of Minnesota provides that "the enlist-
ed men of the national guard shall
receive pay at the rate now and here
after provided for enlisted- men of
similar grade and term of enlistment
in the regular army of the United
States and in addition thereto the sum
of one dollar per day besides trans
portation and shelter.'* From this
allowance fifty cents per day may be
deducted for subsistence.
Section 2404 provides that "when
called into active service by the gov
ernor, each enlisted man shall be paid
by the state the sum of fifty cents
per day in addition to the pay and
allowances provided in the preceding
section for encampments and maneu
vers, together with subsistence."
It does seem as if the law ad
mitted of only one interpretation, and
that is that the members of the guard
are entitled to $2.00 per day and sub
sistence from the time they responded
to the governor's call until they were
mustered into the service of the United
States. At any rate if there is any
doubt in the matter the boys should
b'e given the benefit of the doubt. It
is only a matter of a few thousand
dollars to the rich state of Minnesota
but it means a great deal to many
of the boys.
MANAGER CLARKSON PLEASED.
Praise for Minnesota's Road Law and
It's State Highway Officials.
High praise for Minnesota people,
scenery and roads is contained in a
letter sent by J. D. Clarkson, general
manager of the Jefferson highway,
who recently concluded a trip of inves
tigation over the three proposed
routes for that famous road in the
state, to George W. Cooley, secretary
of the highway commission, he wrote:
"The prodigality of nature which is
apparent in its lush grasses and
flowering plants and accentuated in
the dark canopy of its pine forests, is
duplicated in the hospitality of Min
nesota people.
"The party of seven while in Itasca
park stood with elapsed hands, meas
uring the width of the mighty Mississ
ippi. Seven weeks previous, while on
a visit to New Orleans, the highway
workers stood on the brink of this
same stream while ocean going vessels
rode at anchor on its waters.
"I wish to, say the results of your
constructive thought and work were
everywhere apparent. The trip we
made would have been impossible
without the construction and mainte
nance plans for road improvement
which have been so well conceived and
carried out by you and the highway
commission under the Dunn road law.
"This writer told Senator Dunn it
will be a pleasure and a duty to talk
of the workings of the Dunn law as
he travels, in an effort to get other
states to emulate Minnesota methods
of road construction and maintenance
wherever applicable.
"Many Minnesotans probably do not
appreciate how fortunate they are in
having men like Senator Dunn, your
self and the highway commissioners
to conceive and put in force such bene
ficial laws. I was much surprised to
learn the highway commissioners not
only serve without pay, but have not
taken advantage of the privilege al
lowed them by law to have the state
pay their expenses while on official
business. These officers' reward will
come when they see the incoming flood
of tourists and, homeseekers streaming
over your 365-day roads."St. Paul
Dispatch.
That Baldwin Sinkhole.
By Saturday the road across the
sinkhole in Sherburne county on state
road No. 1, three miles south of town,
will be crossable, and the county com
missioners are expected to be there
and examine and accept the same that
day. The fill is 37 feet deep in places.
A word to the commissioners of
Sherburne county: This road will in
all probability be a link in the Jeffer
son highway. Make a good job of it.
The roadbed may appear firm and
solid now, but to make assurances
doubly sure have the contractors dump
another couple of hundred cubic yards
of earth into the sinkhole. There will
be an immense traffic over this road.
Build the road so it will stand. Do it
now. It can never be done cheaper.
Pile in another 200 yards of earth.
Solidify the road. It has been a costly
job, now make it a good and lasting
one.
4 A Great Feat.
For weeks past there have been
rumors to the effect that a giant Ger
man supersubmersible had left Bremen
for the United States. The rumor
proved true, for on Sunday the
Deutschland, a commercial submarine
with a crew of 29 men and carrying
750 tons of valuable tfyefctuffs, arrived
INNESOTA STORICAL
CIETY
VOLUME XL. NO. 30
at Noifolk, Va., and the next day
docked at Baltimore.
The Deutschland departed from
Bremen June 14 and nine days later
cleared from Heligoland. In crossing
the North sea and the English channel
the Deutschland passed under more
than 200 British vessels, but was
only submerged for a distance of 90
miles during the entire trip.
Captain Paul Konig, the commander
of the Deutschland, says he had no
trouble in avoiding the British vessels
and was not seen at any time on the
voyage. He thinks he will have no
more trouble returning than he had
coming here. Several other vessels of
the same capacity as the Deutschland,
he says, are on their way from Ger
many here and one will arrive within
a few days.
It was a great feat and even Eng
lish newspapers have words of com
mendation for plucky Captain Konig
and his brave crew.
Church Silver Jubilee.
In the "Twenty-five Years Ago"
column of the Union this week there
appears an item telling of the building
of the foundation walls of the German
Lutheran church in this village. The
church and parsonage were completed
that year1891. None of the mem
bers were then overburdened with this
world's goods but they were deter
mined to have a place of worship and
a pastor of their own in Princeton.
Providence seemed to smile on their
efforts for the church has continued
to grow and prosper and the worldly
prosperity of its members has cor
respondingly increased. Twenty-five
years ago most of the members came
to services at the church in heavy
farm wagons today- many of them
come in their own automobiles and
those of them who have not yet in
vested in autoes ride in smart looking
carriages and buggies behind splendid
horses.
Last Sunday the silver jubilee of
the church was most fittingly ob
served. There was a large turnout
of the members of the congregation,
especially of the younger people. The
interior of the sacred edifice was
tastefully decorated with fragrant
flowers.
Rev. Dr. H. Ernst of St. Paul
preached the morning sermon in Ger
man. He is an exceeding able and a
very affable gentleman.
A picnic dinner was served in a
tent on the lot south of the church at
noon, and such a dinner! The tables
were loaded down with the most
tempting viands and more than 250
people partook thereof.
In the afternoon.Rev. E. Schimpfky
of Crookston, a former pastor of the
church here, preached in German, and
the present pastor, Rev. Eugene Ahl,
delivered an eloquent discourse in
English.
The Union extends its heartiest con
gratulations to the "Rev. Eugene Ahl
and his congregation over the suc
cessful celebration of the silver jubilee
of their church.
The Third Regiment Left Monday.
The Third regiment, left Fort Snell
ing on Monday for the Mexican bor
der. The regiment entrained in three
sections. The first battalion to leave
was composed of companies A, B,
and D, and Colonel Resche and his
staff then followed the third battalion
composed of companies I, and
and the last to leave was the sec
ond battalion composed of companies
E, and H. is the Prmceton
Milaca company.
The car accommodations were not of
the best many of the boys were
standing up in the aisles as the sev
eral trains pulled out, but there was
no word of complaint.
It will require four days, it is
thought, to get the regiment to its
destination, somewhere on the border
of Texas, New Mexico or Arizona
the exact location is kept secret.
It is altogether probable that our
boys will see no active service in
Mexico. For a time at least their
duties will consist of policing the bor
der. But wherever they are placed
and whatever duty they may be called
upon to perform our brave Minnesota
boys will not be found wanting.
May a kind Providence keep watch
and ward over them.
Birthday Surprise.
Mr. A. B. Gramer, the popular man
ager of the Mcllhargy Hardware &
Furniture Co., was the victim of an
agreeable surprise Saturday evening.
When he returned home from his
duties at the store at 10 o'clock he
found his residence filled with neigh
bors and other friends, wfto aided him
in the proper observance of the anni
versary of his birth/ A general social
time followed and the occasion was
one of continued enjoyment.
