Violation of Law.
Washington. D. C July IS. Al-
t hough the contention of the British
and French embassies that the German
submarine Deutschland at Baltimore is
a potential warship has had little
weight at the state department in view
of the department's information that
tba vessel is purely a merchant ship,
officials today saw that other bother
some question might arise in conec
tion -Kith the undersea boat's visit.
Alreadv it was said, consideration is
tie from reaching the allies. The de
! p&rlment Is concerned, too. as to the
i boat's treatment if discovered by
I ecemy cruisers in the Atlantic. Under
a ruling that the vessel is a raercnam
craft the state department could not
countenance its sinking in violation of
international law.
U-Boat Is Not So Large.
Baltimore. ML. July 13. Unloading
of the cargo of the German super
submarine Deutschland was completed
early today and the ship's rise shows
that her size has been exaggerated.
Instead of being more than 5W feet
long and more than 30 feet wide, her
length is not more than 250 feet and
her width is less than 2 feet. Her
draught, figured submerged, shows
that she needs at least 32 feet for com
plete submergence. Through all the
feverish activity of the last hours of
the unloading. theug Thomas F. Tlm
nriae played the strong beams of a
powerful searchlight all about sweep
ing the waters, the shore lines and the
Doutschlapd's decks. A smaller pow
ered searchlight which has been set
up on the motor boat Kfco reached
corners that were beyong the Tim

Vast Supply of Guns and

Loqdon, Eng, July IS. The recovery
of the Russian armies since their de
feats of last year and the apparently
Inexhaustible supply of guns and am
munition with which they are provided
continues to be a source of wonder to
military writers. At least six great
armies -are engaged against the Aus
trians and Germans on Russia's west
ern front. All of them are using great
uantities of ammunition, even those not
definitely on the offensive.
The forces under grand duke Nicho
las, in Armenia and Persia, have been
fighting vigorously against the Turk
for months. A few weeks ago parts of
these forces, particularly those west of
Eraerum, were compelled to fall back
in the face of a stronger Turkish army.
Earlv this week the grand duke re
sumed the defensive in this region and
recaptured Mamakhalum. 58 miles west
of Knerura so that the Turks have
fallen back some 25 miles from the
furthest points reached In their counter
offensive.
Battle Near I'Insk Jlarhe.
Meanwhile the armies directly south
of the Pinsk marshes are fighting a
pitched battle with the Austro-German
force of Gen von Linsingen along the
line of the Stokbod river. It probably
will be- some days before the decision is
reached, as the Teutons have brought
up very strong reinforcements ia the
hope of retaining possession of Kovel.

The British are still engaged in
