Manuel Otero of Manzano yes
terday evening brought his sev
en years old son here, who
on Tusday evening met with a
very peculiar and serious acci
dent. A cow hooked him, and
the point of the horn entered
the eye next to the nose and
ripped both lids loose until they
hung by the skin at the outer
corner of the eye. The eyeball
did not appear ts have been in
jured so as to endanger the sight.
This morning Dr. Amble, assist
ed by Dr. Mason, performed the
very delicate operation of stitch
ing the torn parts together. If
the doctors succeed in saving the
boy 8 sight and giving him a use
ful eye, they may well be proud.
The result of the efforts of
Jupiter Pluvius during the past
week have been quite satisfac
tory. Not all parts of the coun
ty have received as much rain as
wanted, but operations are still
going forward and the prospect
is good that all will get enough.
It has rained every day. Gener
ally speaking the southwest, the
west central, the north central
east -of Moriarty and east central
have received plenty for present
requirements. Probably the-pre'
cipitation at Estancia is about
what it has been in all the less
favored portions of the county.
Here the precipitation was .35
of an inch on the 6th, .05 on the
7th. .40 on the 10th. .04 on the
11th, making .84 for the week.

A FINEJROSPECT

nilú coffers. Recent trips over the county
have ahowu almost uniformly (rood stand b of
the New Mexico Pinto bean. The tanda at
compared with this time IftBt year are much
better. Better cultural methods seem to have
been followed. These ffood methods used in
conserving the deep moisture of last spring
sertm to have done tbe work. There is an attl
tnde of permanency on tbe part of the farmers
which seemed somewhat lacking last year. A
standard for work and real home building
senms evident.
ibe bean area baa been increased 50 percent
as indicated by crop reporters and Dersonal ob
servation, A 90 per cent condition is reported
ae compared with 75 percent conditisa this
time last year. Conservative estimates place
the total area at 15,000 acres. This area taken
at the RVnratrn VÍaIH and nrimi nf lout vaar
wauld yield a quarter of a million dollars.

the possible increase in yield resulting from
the better staudn, tbe .naff million mark may

able damage. The 10 percsnt off condition
may largely be attributed to this source. The
damage from this source is smaller than last
year. A large number of farmers took ad
vantage of cloan cultivation and fall plowing
aB control for the cut-worroB. It paid well.
Almost without exception there was no appre
ciable damage except along the outskirts of the
fields whero inroads were made from the weeds.
Reports from ovr the state where future con
tracts have been offered indicste lively prices
and competition for this year's crop. Specific
statements as to prices offered have not been
forthcoming. These statements indicate that
for the present at least, prices between 5 and
6 cents are thought of. While at present no !
great dependence can be put on such state- i
ments. the general attitude of buyers is none
the less comforting. People in tonch with the
situation advise against the present opportuni
ties for making futare contracts. Wo do know
that the California pink bean prices are open-1
ing up much ahead of the prices last year. i
A telegram from the Bureau of Crop Esti
mates gives the following information : July 1,
fio, now nexico Deans per cent condition
Wholw United States 83W oorcent nonriition
Compare tliaee figures with those of last year
and we read as follows: July 1, 1015. New Mex
ico beans 85 per cent conditi n. whole United
States 8'. 7 percent condition. This will show a
possible shortage due' to condition in both the
state and the United States. While other be n
districts have lowered the condition report in
our state the Estancia Valley seoms to have
helditsown. When this condition report is
considered with the faotihat there are scarcely I
any beans to be had at present, together with!
the export demand, our expectation of good !
prices seems reasonablo.
Our rains seem to be materializing. Our 1
stands are good. Prices seem reasonably well
assured. It will pay every farmer In the coun-
tv to give evory attention to this crop. Keep:
the eds out. Hold a good growing moisture. ,
Use careful harvest methods. Keep after tbe ;
poor stand which you may have. A poor stand
may do better than same good stands of past ;
years. Let's have that half million dollar crop
if it is at all possible- Roland Harwell, Coun-:
ty Agricultural Agent.
County A trent Harwell left Tuesday i
for Albuquerque to assist Mr. Elser. '
Farm Management Demonstrator, and
County Agent Stewart in farm man
agement survey work. The four re
maining days of the week will be spent
in covering- a large farm area to gath
er data from farmers regarding farm
operations. The purpose of this sur
vey is to establish what methods and
crops are really producing the income
or, rather what factors are essential in
the particular farming of that district
This work involved a financial state
ment for the preceding year from
each farmer, together with other in
formation. The farmer is in the end
presented with an analysis of his own
farm which points out the important
factors and a statement comparing his
farm with others of the district. Such
surveys in the past have resulted in
much good.
County Agent Stewart will later as
siat in similar work in Torrance county.
The plan is for an exchange of labor.
