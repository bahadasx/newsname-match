AdßGnistaption Gets
[~'.ord Japanese Seek
• u the Philippine Islands
jK'ashington, D. C., July 13.—The |
government, it became
k* >wn here, has included within the
p-'fview of its imperial ambition the
a fluisitlon of the Philippine islands.
Japanese diplomacy is now being |
clrected with a view, not only to ex- :
tending control over China, but to the j
creation of conditions favoring the j
acquisition of the Philippines. Cer- i
tain disclosures here indicate that con
siderations of this character actuated
Japan In part at least In negotiating
with Russia an agreement under
which Japan will have a free hand, so
far as Russia is concerned, in carry
ing out its designs in the Far East.
It does not appear at this time that
Japan contemplates a forcible seizure
of the Philippines from the United
States. So far as the present dis
closures go, the island empire is bent
upon a peaceful acquisition of the
Archipelago and is willing to bide its
time until events In the Far East
make possible the realization of the
ambition.
Secret reports made to the admin
istration by officials in the Philippines
indicate that Japan has entertained
hope, not entirely dissipated, of ob
taining possession of the islands in
the event of their liberation by the
United Stutes. Even then the islands
would not be forcibly seized, but
would be subjected to an extension
of Japanese influence similar to the
procedure followed by Tokio in the
case of Manchuria and now of the
remainder of China.
