After having been for five days
obscured by clouds which poured
forth almost ceaseless showers the
skies cleared up yesterday, and the
storm which has brought so much
damage not only in tb territory im
mediately contiguon to Columbus
but throughout Mississippi and
Alabama and portions of Georgia
sems to have at last spent it fury.
The storm came up gradually and
disappeared in the same manner.
The wind and rain made their initial
appearance last Wednesday night
and old Boreas was the first to
show signs of weariness, the wind
having practically ceased by Monday
while the rain continued at least
twenty-four hours longer, the last
shower having descended late Tues
day night.
The damage resulting from the
storm in the several states through
which it passed will run well into
the millions, and while no buildings
ii i . i . i ,
were oiown aown in mis immeaiute
action nor did any loss of life oc
cur, tiie damujcc - to- V'tu!tuil
crops and to roads and bridges will
reach a considerable sum. The
county during the past eighteen
months expended nearly a half mil
lion dollars in improving her roads,
and nearly every public highway in
the county has been more or less
damaged, everyone of them except
the Military and Aberdeen roads
having been rendered impassable by
washouts.
The Tuscaloosa and Pickensville
roads suffered more than other
local highways. The Tuscaloosa road
was constructed several years ago
under the supervision of a govern
ment expert and was considered a
model highway. It was not however,'
strong enough to withstand the on
slaught made upon it by the mad
dened waters, and, after having
been transformed into a muddy
slush, washed away, leaving nothing
but a series of holes and gulleys to
mark its once majestic sweep. The
Pickensville road, which was sur
faced with novaculite, suffered
practically the same fate, and sec
tions of the Airline road were com
pletely submerged, its condition
having been so bad as to render it
utterly impassable.
Columbus is situated between two
streams, the Tombigbee river form
!.:(?: its western boundary, while the
Luxapalila skirts its eastern corpora
tion line. Both of these streams have
been well out of their banks, and
the people living within the con
confines of the inundated territory
were forcd to seek higher ground.
Mr. C. R. Shackleford who operates
a dairy not far from the Tombigbee,
found it necessary to remove his
cattle to the old Myrtle Terrace in
the southeastern suburbs of the city,
while many people living in Burns'
bottom were forced to move to safer
places.
All the railroads in this section
have been heavy sufferers from the
flood. Not a single train left Co
lumbus for Birmingham over the
Southern for nearly a week, tha
first east bound train to take its
departure since July 4 having pulled
out Monday afternoon. It was re
ported Monday thA. both the South
ern Railway bridge at Waverly and
the badge on which trains over the
Mobile and Ohio cross the Luxapa
lila a few miles southeast of tho
city were in danger, but these struc
tures have so far withstood the on
slaught of the waters, and are now
believed to be safe.
John Alexander, a negro amnicol
ist, had a narrow escape Tuesday
morning, when a small boat in which
he was seated capsized near tat
county bridge, which spans the Tom
bigbee river at the foot " of Main
street. He clung to the boat, how
ever, and succeeded in rcucWnj
clump of trees, from which place he
was later taken by rescuers to a
place of safety.

MEMBERS OF COMPANY
WANT LIEUT. LAWLEY
FOR CAPTAIN.
APPOINTMENT IS .
UP TO GOV. BILBO
It is Said That the Name of
Lieut. Rush, of Biloxi, is Be
ing Considered.
Up to yesterday no action had
been taken in the matter of appoint
ing a commander for the Columbus
Riflemen to fill the place mmle va
cant by the lamentable death of
Capt. Mullins, which occurred at
Jackson on July 5, and members of
the company are very anxious to
have the appointment go to Lieut.
John Lawley. Under military regu
lations the right of filling the va
cancy is delegated to Gov. Bilbo,
and it is snid that he is being urged
to name Lieutenant Rush, of Vieks
burg, for the place. Members of
the company, however, prefer to be
under the command of a Columbus
man, and have telephoned a request
that local citizens get up a petition
requesting Governor Bilbo to ap
point Lieutenant Lawley, and send
it to Jackson nt the earliest possible
moment.
The following special from Jack
son gives some intersting news re
garding affairs at Camp Swen. Tay
lor:
"But little more than four weeks
ago officers of the organized militia
in Mississippi were going through
the preliminaries for making ready
to hold the annual state encamp
ment. This event had been anticipat
ed with much interest, and the
Young Men's Business Club, which
A'ya- o !a,f;'y responsible' for biir.gv
ing the encampment to Jackson, had
!egun the first 'preparatory work for
getting the grounds at Livingston
Park in readiness. The encampment
was to have opened for 15 days, on
July 10, and the usual round of ac
tivities were being planned.
"On the day originally set for op
ening the encampment there was a
far different aspect noticeable, with
a well developed military camp, un
der the auspices of the United
States, and in charge of officers of
the army, and each man in camp un
der oath to serve the state as wll as
fhe nation, and not only within the
borders of their own country but
abroad, if need be. Save for the fact
that some of the equipment was lack
ing, and a few necessary formalities
still awaiting attention, within the
four weeks which have intervened,
the state national guard has been
whipped into shape as a body, al
though a majority of its members
and enlisted men are raw and undis
ciplined.
"Just what will follow the march
ing of the First Mississippi Regi
ment to the region of the Rio
Grande is not stated definitely,
though the impression prevails in
some quarters that Camp Taylor
will be maintained indefinitely where
other units will be mobilized and

until it now holds the dominating
hills around Peronne, a town which
has been strongly fortified by the
Germans, and the possession of
which they are likely to contest with
the utmost determination.
The British have retaken Gonial-.
maison and are again in control of
nearly the entire front of Trones
and the Mamametz wood. There has
been desperate fighting in both of
these sectors for several days past.
The Frenrh along the Somme car
ried out some minor detached oper
ations which allowed them to
straighten out their lines, and ap
parently the French are waiting for
the British to straighten out their
line before making the attempt to
drive the Germans out of Peronne.
In this great battle, about 22,00(1
prisoners have been taken by the
Franco-British forces, of whom the
British announce they have captured
7,500.
In the Verdun sector, the Ger
mans, unmoved by the attacks north
and south of the Somme, have suc

Damloup battery, which has been the
bone of contention for days past,
and in the French line in the Fumin
wood on the right bank of the Meuse.
At other points the Germans are
carrying out a strong offensive.
On the Russian front the. Stokod
sector is the central point of the
Russian advance. The Germans have
brought up strong reinforcunents
to oppose the Russians, who are now
within twenty miles of Kovel. The
defenses of this town are believed
to be powerful, although there are
now no natural barriers to Gen.
Brusiloff's army and its objective.
Fighting along the line is of a fur

Bantlils Krtrr.il to Point Nt
Parral, Where Stand is F.x
pec ted to P,e Made.
Chihuahua City, July 12.- Two
Villa bunds attacked Carrann gar
risons today at Kosario and Parral,
but in both cases were biaten off
with lost-es, according to official re
ports of General Trevino.
From Ivosario the bandits were
driven southward toward the Du
rango line by government troops
under Gens. Gacito and Hernandez.
Other reports to General Trevino
indicate that a scouting putrol from
Parral had encountered one of the
small bands of outlaws who scatter
ed after the attack on Jiminez in
the vicinity of F.I Valle and hud
driven them into the hills but no de
tails were given.
The. report spnt by Gen. Garcia,
commander ut Parral, said the ban
dits suffered heavy losses, and re
treated to Sombrenctillo, a few
miles southeast of IVrral. It adds
that if they will make a stand there
the deciding battle of the Villa
campaign will be fought late today
or tomorrow, as the de facto gov
ernment's cavalry under Gens. Ar
ricta and Ramos, is almost in strik
ing distance.
Gen. Garcia gave no details of
the fighting, which he described as
"very savage." He said, however,
it is evident that the bandits' inten
tion was to drive off the Parral gar
rison no the town could be looted
and mom ammunition obtained.
The number of troops engaged
is not stated. The Parral garrison
has been previously estimated at
about 400 men.
Gen. Trevino said he had not re
ceived details of either of the clash
es, but oil the reports indicate they
were skirmishes more or less minor
in nature. He said that every effort
to force the Villistas to buttle had
failed.
No doubt remains in the minds
of military authorities here that
Villa is directing the campaign along
the Durango-Chihuahua border. Re
ports reaching Gen. Trevino from
a number of escaped prisoners have
described the bandit chieftain as
riding in a coach, his crutche at
his side, with two of his favorite
chargers being led behind. It is as
serted that every effort of the de
facto government would be launch
ed in an attempt to effect his cap
tare. It wa announced that govern
ment troops have practically com
pleted an enveloping movement, by
means of whic h it is hoped to put
an end to the bandit campaign. The
Villistas are now enclosed, Gen.
Trevino said, in a definite area,
pivoting about Los I'ieves and Tor
reon de Canas. Co-operation be-
