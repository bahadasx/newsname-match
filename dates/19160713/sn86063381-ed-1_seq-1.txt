ATTACK: ON BORDER MAY
COMPLICATE SITUATION

Way Second to
Leave Soon.
By United Press.)
Columbus, July 13.Heavy patrols
of cavalry are alertly watching for
the arrival of bandit troops reported
to be gathering in the San Simon
valley. Army officers here fear that
Villistas' lieutenants are leading the
bandits with the main objective to
complicate the Mexican-United States
relations by attacking border towns.
Bobleter Deserted.
Camp Bobleter, ^rt Snelling,
Minn., July 13".Camp Bobleter
looked deserted today.
With the First infantry 24 hours
on its way to the Mexican border and
with the Third infantry possibly ac
tually on the Mexican border, the
camp that was the canvas covered
homes of 3,122 Minnesota boys here,
is the shelter only of the Second in
fantry and artillery battalions.
As the United Press correspondent
entered the camp today he found lit
tle of the military spirit that bris
tled. To his immediate left, as he
stood at the camp entrance, there
were a large number of tin* cans
and refuse to mark the place where
the gallant First lived.
Then, to the far left arose the tents
of the Second infantry. These, loom
ing up against the forest background
of the far end of the camp, seemed
desolate. Across what was the regi
mental street, was the deserted camp
of the boys of the Third infantry,
marked only by cans, refuse and bare
ground that once was the^site of
tents.
Just when the Second regiment
and the artillery will entrain was a
matter of speculation today. Their
departure, possibly this week, was ex
pected.
Plans are being made to solicit
funds for the constructing of a new
grandstand at the county fair
grounds. It is planned to construct
a stand at a cost of about ?2,500. A
request will be made for about $1,000
donations.
LaSalle, 111., July 13.A first call
was issued for state troops here today
