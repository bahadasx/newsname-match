ihe Commercial lilub
Is Progressing
The Commercial Club of Chesterfield
is an assured fact, A
very satisfactory number of
those who signed up are paying
up and it has been predicted
that if enough money can be collected
in July to launch the venture,
its success will be assured.
This has been done and the next
business session of the club will
be held in the club's hall, furnished
with the club's own furniture.
The various committees
are already at work, planning an
advertising campaign for the
town and community and looking
around for new industries to
welcome to our city.
Among the active workers for i
this, combining &r it. rlnpa
of trade features with those of a i
commercial club, is a spirit of
optimism that will be hard to |
down. The need for the club
and the field of usefulness open i
to it are apparent to all and the <
number of good citizens endors- ;
ing the move leads one to believe
that regardless of differences
of opinion on other subjects
our people are a unit when <
ii comes to town building and ,
town boosting j

Amus-U Amuses
Since moving into the now
hall, the Amus-U Theatre ha*
been furnishing some excellenl
amusement.
The new big serial, 44Th?
Diamond from the Sky" is e
sure-winner. This, combined
with the other attractions, will
make the picture house more
popular than ever. (
Special matinees will bo given
on Saturdays.
Next Tuesday there will be a
treat at this house that ought tc
be appreciated by the entire population.
A new Mexican war picture
will be shown. This film, made
at great expense and risk, de
picts genuine war scenes of re
cent occurrence and tells a ptory
of dramatic interest.
This is a new film now being
shown in Charlotte, and Chesterfield
is to bo congratulated ou
getting it so quickly.
Owing to its very high cost the
management announces the price
jf admission for this show to 10
ind 25 cents.

Chesterfield County
Leads The State
l i Hartsville, July.?By way of a
fitting conclusion to a most snc5
cessful session of tlie Pee Dee
' summer school an educational
I rally was held here recently.
I Stimulating and valuable addresses
were made by President
E. W. Sikes of Coker college
and Mayor F. A- Miller in
welcoming those present from a
t distance and by Miss Caroline
( Bo9tick of the widely known
Berry school in UeoYgia, Mrs.
Dora D. Walker, state assistant
s in home demonstrations work,
( and Dr- W. W. Long of Clemson
college. In the afternoon before
a large crowd Mrs. Walker, assisted
by Miss Lechner and Mrs.
Ham, county demonstration
, agents in Darlington, and Miss
Bostick, gave demonstration in
jelly and bread making and the
URe of home labor saving devices.
J. A. McFaden and VV. R. Elliott
discussed winter gardening
and the cnlture of tomatoes.
The increasing value of the automobile
as a means of enabling
many people to take advantage
ot such occasions was plainly
evidenced by the number of
these machines parked on the
campus.
The authorities of the Pee
Dee summer school said that
they plan to have next year a
bigger and better summer school
than ever for the teachers of the
L'ee Dee section. The enrollment
for the session just closed
was UK). This is the only summer
school in the State that follows
the prescribed course of!
study and uses the State adopt-1
ed text books. No less than 12
counties had teachers in attend-1'
ance, nearly all of whom took
examinations thereby securing '
renewal of their certificates or I
credit toward State certificates.1
Chesterfield county gave evidence
at this summer school of 1
her very rapid progress recently'
in educational activity. Lurgely ;
through the interest and activity
of County Superintendent R. A.
Rouse some forty Chesterfield
teachers took full work in the
summer school. Four years ago
Chesterfield was near the bottom
of the list of counties in all mat- '
ters educational but now stands
fourth In taxation and school 1
work, eighth in per capita expen- j
ditures, while leading all in the
i i !
number of modern school build
ings. It is the only purely ag- '
rieultural county in the State
that has adopted a special school '
tax in every district?The State. '
Bad Feed Dangerous
Often the fanner at this time 1
of the year has some old corn or
old hay, which if ic has not been 1
sheltered properlv, is moldy and 1
in bad condition. Such feed of- 1
ten is the cause of serious
trouble with stock. Farmers
should be careful how they use
old moldy feed of any kind, for
it is dangerous, often meaning
the loss of seveial head of stock
before the t rouble is located.
