NO. 12
WHEAT YIELD IS
MORE THAN DOUBLE
THAT OF LAST YEAR
Tlint there will he thousands of bu
shels of wheat in excess to that pro
duced by the plains farmers last year
is proven by every fanner who comes
in from that portion of the county.
They tell us that the yield will be
as good to the acre ns it was last year
but the grain is far superior anil will
test better than 01 pounds to the bush
el. The acreage put in this year is
more than double that of last, there
fore the output will be more than
double. One farmer said he had only
made $2500 off his dry farm this year
and he intended to invest most of that
in more land if he could buy it.
Some of the farmers say that their
wheat will yield twenty bushels to
the acre while most of it will run
about ten bushels to the acre. This
does not sound very large to eastern
farmers but when they compare the
value of their land in dollars and cents
to that in Quny county, they are not
receiving nearly so much on their in
vestment. Two or three dozen teams and wa
gons were here this week from the
wheat belt after coal for threshing
purposes. Threshing has already be
gun and with double the output of last
year the farmers are sure of a suc
cessful season.
The Tucumcnri elevator is not yet
up but those who intend to build it
report that they will be here with a
construction company ns soon as the
material can be gotten here. It will
pay the farmers not to be in too big
a hurry in contracting their wheat as
a little competition on this side of
the wheat belt may mean considerable
to those who have wheat for sale, and
the Tucumcnri firm will make 'ill com
petitors go their limit.

NICE RAINS WEDNESDAY
For a timo Wednesday it looked as
if Tucumcari was in for a good soak
ing rain, but tho elements thought
different and passed us up, going in
both directions. A nice rnin is re

The E. P. & S. W. base ball team
came up Sunday from El Paso and
crossed lints with the local aggrega
tion of ball tensors and were defeated
in a well played game bv a score of
0 to 0.
The new twirler. Wallis, was on the
mound for Tucumcnri tint ing the first
three or four inning-- and showed up
well, but owing to an injury to his
knee sustained during a fast play, he
retired in favor of liramlett, the old
stand-by, who pitched excellent ball
and succeeded in shutting the visitors
out. Tho visitors had a good team
but wore unable to hit the bull when
a hit meant anything.
The following account of the game
was printed in the El Paso Morning
Times:
"The E. P. & S. W. club from the
local offices journeyed to Tucumcnri
Sunday and were shown the wny to the
end of a speedy contest with a shut
out, while the New Mexico home team
came across witli six tallies.
" 'Monk' Wnllis worked good from
the pitcher's box for Tucumcnri, but
was forced to retire when he wrench
ed his knee in the fourth inning. Brum
lett took bis place. Only one player of
the railroad team got i far as third
base. The visitors played strong un
til the eighth, when they began boot
ing the leather nbout the lot and it
cost three runs."

BOOST YOUR TOWN
If you have traveled within the last
two weeks between San Jon ami Mon
toya you have undoubtedly noticed
the new Texas. New Mexico Highway
Association signs. This road (be
tween Amarillo and Las Vegas) will
appear in the next Blue Bool; and will
undoubtedly bring a great many sum
mer tourists this way. In fact we
have had several cars daily of late.
We will have to spend a little money
to do some necessary repair work and
keep this road in .shape if we want to
encourage this travel. Not only will
we get the cheapest advertising pos
sible, but remember, also that every
car passing through stops over in our
town one night or longer. Therefore,
the people here should lie willing to
do their share, not only the owners
of cars, but all lui-sines; men, and in
order to discus.s this matter a meet
ing of all the c'tizens is hereby called
for Tuesday evening. July 18. at 8:00
p. m., at the Elks Home. Everyone
who has the interests of Tucumcari at
heart is invited. A. D. Goldenberg,
Vice President Texas, New Mexico
Mountain Highway Association.
DEM ING REGULATES SALOONS
Denting saloonkeepers will have to
pay a license of $1000 a year instead
of the former sum of $450 ns soon as
an ordinance recently passed in that
city goes into efiVct. In addition they
will have to close their places at 0
o'clock each night and keep them
closed until 0 o'clock the next morn
ing, nnd will have lo remain closed
all day Sunday. Screens are tabooed

boisterous conduct.
RATTLER KILLS CHILD

eight year old son of Mr. nnd Mrs. J.
F. Travelstead, who live in the An
niston neighborhood, while out play
ing was struck on the bend by a rat
tle snake. The little fellow was brot
to town for treatment, but his condi
tion was such that nothing could be
done, and ho died the following even
ing. This proves again that the sting
of the rattler is deadly.
Teams and scrapers are again work
ing on Gayncll street and the big
grader will be put up there in order
to make that street one of the best
in town. It is the one all autos enter
the city front tho east and west, being

! "THE GREATEST GOOD
FOR THE GREAT
EST NUMBER"
The following communication from
H. B. Jones, who is spending the sum
mer with relntlves it Marcellus, Mich,
fully explains itself:
Marcellus, Mich,, July 0, 1010
Editor Tucumcnri News,
Dcnr Sir:
I am inclosing you herewith a clip
ping from the Roy Spanish American,
regarding the management of the high
school in Raton that I think could as
well apply to the school management
in Tucumcari. I notice by rending the
papers that a considerable number of
the oldor and better qualified grade
teachers in our locnl schools have re
signed since their appointment in the
snrlng. I believe that tho reason for
this Is Inrgely because our board sees j
fit to give its largo salaries to the spe
cial teachers instead of to the grade
teachers, where the most responsibil
ity must be assumed nnd where the
REAL EFFICIENCY is MOST IM
PORTANT. In the efforts of tho lo
cnl honrd to make our schools the
"best in the state" I think that they
are putting too much attention to the
high school and not making the proper
effort to keep the work In the grades
up to the proper standard. I for ono,
don't believe thnt more of the tax
payers' money should be expended in
enlarging the high school building or
enlarging the facilities for the special
departments, until nftcr proper and
adequate, well ventilated and well
lighted roomH are provided for the
children in the grades, and they arc
placed in charge of well qunlified,
well paid teachers; and I believe that
the Kuperintcndcnt should be charged
with tho duty of seeing to it that the
proper standard of efficiency is main
tained by the teachers in the lower
grades. "The greatest good for the
greatest number" should not be a poor
motto for a school board to follow.
Yours very truly,
H. B. JONES.
"Tht! Raton Range last week pre
sent tho truth regarding the Colfnx
County High School which in itself is
nn arrangement of the system which
creates it. It says in pnrt:
"Colfax county has a high school
which, with its equipment and grounds
is valued at nearly $100,000. Out of
this investment, which docs not in
clude about $10,000, for instructors
and mnintninnticc nnnunlly, we this
year received a return of nineteen
students graduated in other words,
it cost us, outside the originnl invest
ment, nearly $1000 per year for each
graduate student. In past years the
graduates have been many less."
"This only cmphnsizes the fact ap
parent to all thnt the schools are
not satisfied with rendering the great
est good to the greatest number. They
will slight the lower grades where all
the school children get their start and
squander money on high schools where
only a few get the benefit. When the
conditions exist ns in the case of Ra
ton, whore the cost of educating a
child in high school is three times the
cost of plncing the snme pupil in the
State University for the same period,
there is something radically wrong
nnd the schools should be taken nut
of the hnnds of political manipulators
and visionary theorists and placed in
the hands of competent, practical ed
ucators." QUAY COUNTY HAS 28 SOL
DIERS NOW ON THE BORDER
C. H. Alldredge has returned home
from El Paso and Columbus where
he wont on business. He saw the Tu
cumcari and Quay county boys and
(rays they are getting along fine, "but
rnrin' to go." Out of thirty-'.hroo men
sent down fiom here twenty-six pass

U. S. soldiers.
AUTO LICENSE FEES
Motor vehicle license fees in the
first six months of this year for New
Mexico totaled $41,222, or $11,598 in
excess of the total amount collected
during the whole of 1915. The cost of
administration together with refunds,
during the six months amounted to
34,2:15.54, lenving to the credit of the
state road fund tho other half being
distributed among the counties in pro
portion to the number of licenses is
sued to owners in each county.
Chnvcs county contributed $5,1011
and Bernalillo $4,040 while Sandoval
paid in but $150. Quny county paid in
$1,382 and Curry county $1,104.
The amount received by the county
to the credit of the road fun was $021.

MEXICANS FIGHT EACH
OTHER NEAR CHIHUAHUA
Chihuahua City, Mex July 12
Heavy fighting is now proceeding be
tween do facto government troops un
der Gen. Ernesto Garcia and a large
force of Villistas at Cerro Blanco,
some miles below Parral, according
to dispatches received today by Gen.
Jacinto Trevino.
Gen. Garcia reported that he was
engaged in holding the bandits until
the force: under Gen. Matias Ramos
and Gen. Domingo Arrieta, which arc
now proceeding up the railway from
Jimenez, arrive and turn the scales
in the conflict.
Gen. Hilario Rodriguez, one of the
Villistn lenders who joined Cnnuto
Reyes in surrendering to the govern
ment n few months ngo, hns informed
Gen. Trevino thnt he had received a
personal letter from Villa, in which
the bandit chief pleaded with him to
return to his old allegiance and to join
him in resisting the "Ynnkec invaders'
This letter was dated June 15 at San
Juan Bautista.
In his communication to Gen. Tre
vino, Gen. Rodriguez stnted thRt he
hud no sympathy with tho efforts of
Villa to divide his country and was
determined to help the Carranza au
thorities to restore order.
El Paso. July 12. Fort Bliss, Carnp
Pershing nnd Camp Cotton are over
flowing with national guard troops
and it has been found necessary to es
tablish a new cump three miles north
of Fort Bliss nnd another camp site
downtown is being looked for by the
regular army officers where the addi
tional Michigan troops will be encamp
ed. With the arrival of the First Penn
sylvania cavalry Tuesduy afternoon
and evening, Camp Pershing was bad
ly crowded so that the new camp be
yond the fort and near the city wa
terworks was selected and the entire
Pensylvania division, composed of nine
regiments of Pennsylvania troops, will
be camped there under command of
Maj. Gen. Charles M. Clement. There
will be 14,000 troops in this camp,
when the last of the Pennsylvania com
mands now on the road reach the bor
der here.
The 8th Pennsylvania which passed
through Tucumcari Wednesday will
perhaps be the last from that state.
A regiment of Rhode Island Cav
alry passed through Tucumcari today
enroute to El Paso. If this i(ovorn
ment don't do something to quiet Old
Mexico she will miss a mighty good
chance and be nut several thousand
dollars in order to run a blutT. There
i.- no doubt what Carranza or any oth
er leader in Mexico will do when the
troop are removed from the border.
Tho Mexicans are being taught to
detest Americans and will recogniz"
nothing but force. United States must
make a stand and not retreat until
she has affected peace and mnde tho
southern republic safe for habitation,
no matter if it take a thousand yenrs,
and since the soldiers arc ready to
do their part and many others willing
to nssist them, Wilson cannot afford
to back up and take for granted that
Carranza will or can do anything. He
is nfraid of Villa and Villa knows it,
so nothing can he expected to be de
rived by again believing in Carranza s
ability to rid Old Mexico of bandits.
MEXICANS ARE UNARMED
Santa Fc, N. M July 10. Reports
that hundreds of Moxicnn section
hands on the Santa Fe railroad around

CITIZENS AND RAIL
ROAD MEN RAISE THEIR
PORTION ON Y. M.G.A.
The Y. M. C. A. soliciting committee
of which H. II. McElroy was one, re
ceived a nice donation of $200 to the
building fund from Mr. Alfred E. Bent
owner of the local Electric Light Co.
Mr. Bent has always taken an inter
est in the welfare of Tucumcari and
is nlways ready to donate his share
to anything he thinks is for the bet
terment of our city. He says in part
lo Mr. McElroy:
"Replying to your favor of June
:10th 1 am today forwarding subscrip
tion to Mr. Sickles per enclosed copy
of letter to him, nnd after entering
up the record on the enrd he will de
liver you the subscription enrd.
"I am pleased to enclose herewith
the company's subscription of $200.00.
"This is a very worthy undertaking
and wo are glad to bo afforded on op
portunity of contributing our mite.
"Trusting you will satisfactorily
succeed in raising the balance, I am.
"Yours very truly
"ALFRED E. BENT"
This subscription makes the total
amount of the Citizens' Committee
nearly that desired, but the railroad
boys have not yet finished their pnrt.
They expect to have their portion of
the 510,000 within a few days.
Now, it is up to the railroad com
pany to dig up their share or $15,000
and work on the new building could
be commenced nt once.

The bonds were sold on May 29 to
the Lumbermnns' Trust company of
Snn Francisco, Calif. The sale, of
course, was made contingent upon the

discovered, and ns it was such a ser
ious ono ns to invalidate tho hondis-
