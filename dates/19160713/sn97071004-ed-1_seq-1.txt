United States lias 21,000,000
Men Eligible to Military Service
Washington, D. C The census bu
reau, while unable to answer specifical
ly the question how many able-bodied
citizens of military age there are in the
United States, estimates that the total
number of male citizens and and those
who have declared their intention' to
become citizens, who are 18 to 45
years old inclusive, is not far from 21,
000,000.
This estimate is based on the as
sumption that there has been an in
crease of aproximately 10 per cent in
the population of the country since the
census of 1910. When that census
was taken the total number of male
citizens and prospective citizens 18
years old and over but under 46 was
19.183,000. Of this number, 14,857,
000 were foreign-born whites who had
become naturalized or had. declared
their intention of doing so, 2,052,000
were negroes and 60,000 were Indians.
Socialists Insist Eood Supply is Short
The Hague During a debate on the
food situation at the Thursday evening
session of the Berlin city council, the
Socialists complained of the inequality
and inadequacy of the distribution of
food under the mass-feeding scheme.
Councillor Mommsen declared that no
resident of Berlin was yet starving.
This elicited a sharp contradiction.
Municipal Physician Weber main
tained there was no question of under
feeding, yet whereupon cries of strong
dissent arose from the Socialists.
The Socialist councillor, Hoffman,
said that he himself had been a patient
at the Rudolph Virchow hospital for
months, and knew how Beriously the
dietary had been reduced.

below Baltimore Sunday night after
voyaging safely across the Atlantic,
passing the allied blockading squad

watching for her off the American
coast
She carried a message from Emperor

Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine reached
safety between the Virginia capes at
1 :45 o clock Sunday morning, by. a
heavy pall of darkness which settlad

setting of a tell-tale half moon.
Once inside, the visitor threw cau

time attracting the attention of the

nearly two weeka to greet the Deutsch-
land and convoy her into port
Little was known here about what
happened during the epoch-making
cruise across the ocean, which in
small measure at least breaks the
blockade on German trade with the
rest of the world. None of the sub
marine's crew had landed and the
agents of her owners had received only
meager reports. Such information aa
was available came directly from the
pilot and from Captain Hans F,
Hinsch, of the North German Lloyd
Liner Neckar, laid up here since the
beginning of the war.
F. Gillies, Washington State
fund looter, Escapes From lail
Olympia, Wash. J. F Gillies, twice
convicted of embezzling $20,000 from
state industrial insurance funds while
employed as claim agent for the state,
Sunday night pried off two flimsy locks
with a bolt as a jimmy and escaped
from the Thurston county jail. With
him went Henry Roberts, awaiting
transfer to the reformatory for a stat
utory offense.
Prosecutinsr Attorney Yantis ordered
the arrest of Mrs. Gillies on a warrant
harging her with aiding the escape of
the prisoners. Mrs. Gillies was not
locked up, but was taken to the home
of a policeman and placed in the care
of the officer s wife.
It is believed the prisoners boarded
a train bound for Portland.
An automobile is known to have left
town about midnight and it is be
lieved to have taken the - two men to
ward Canada. At a late hour no trace
had been reported of either.
Shortly after dark Gillies and Rob
erts locked an old man held on a minor
charge in his cell and pried their way
out.
Sheriff McCorkle was at Centralis
and James Fennell, County game war
den, who occasionally slept at the jail,
was out of town.
By sawing off the riveted end of the
bolt by which their cell would have
been locked, had that precaution been
taken, Gillies and Roberts slipped out
the bolt and then sawed the end of it
off on the bias to make a chisel point
by which they pried their way out

AFTER a long day of strenuous

certainly tired, and his disinclina

was comprehensible. But there was
no compromise; mother insisted and
the task was soon accomplished. He
came back to mother and aald, "Now
they're all put away, mother. Give me
a nickel."

Tbla suggested a possible misunder

than declared, "You don't know what
a slave is, Clarence!"
"Oh, yes I do," persisted the boy. "A
slave Is like the colored people In the
South who used to be made to work
without getting paid."

he had already discovered that he

the point at which he has the germ of
appreciation for money he certainly
should have an opportunity to get It if
that can possibly be arranged. And

There may be virtue in the man
Who's always sure he's right
Who'll never hear another's plan
And seeks no further light;
But I like more the chap who sings
A somewhat different song,
Who says, when he has messed up

It's hard for anyone to say
That failure's due to him
That he lost hls-flght or way
Because his lights burned dim.
It takes a man aside to throw
The vanity that's strong,
Confessing: , "Twas my fault I

I'm sorry; I was wrong."

Child's Allowance

to 8e a Slave."
If the family has the means there are
two waya open, both of which may be
used at some time.
A child may be given a small regu
lar allowance for his own use. Through
this he may learn the Joy of immedi
ate Indulgence of trifling whims; or
he may learn to expend his resources
with discrimination; or he may learn
the advantages of deferring expendi
ture for more favorable purchasing.
For the reason that the allowance Is
a part of the routine Income of the
child, by virtue of his membership in
the home community, it should never
be used aa an Instrument of "discipline."-
As to ita amount It should
be Increased only in recognition of
larger needs, and it should be dimin
ished only when retrenchment is
necessary for the family as a whole
or when changing conditions Indicate
reduced needs for the child.
In addition to allowance children
should have opportunities to earn ex
tra amounts of money. It is the money
earned that gives them the necessary
inner experience without which one is
never able to translate money value
Into tarms of effort and exertion and
sacrifice. Money that comes without
effort may teach the child to spend
wisely, or to save; but it can never
teach him the human cost of the things
that he uaes from day to day. It la
perhaps at this point more than any
where else that the children of the
well-to-do fall to become acquainted
with the life problems of the mass of
the people. They come to feel the
value of money in terms of what it
can buy, but not in terms of what it
costs. Only in the effort of labor can
the true value of money be conceived.
