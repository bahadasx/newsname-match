Mr. and Mrs. V. 1). Newlon Buy the
It. It. Kiee Farm in the Strawberry
Flat County For $23,000 Ar
tesian Well Belt Gives
Prumsi-e of Great
Things.
In a deal which was consummated
the past week, R. B. Rice disposes of
his Strawberry Flat farm to Mr. and
Mrs. W. D. Newlon. The consldera-
tion was $25,000. The Rice farm
consists of 1014 acres. Of this, 400
acres is in blue stem wheat, which
from present Indications will make
twenty bushels to the acre. The New
Ions have already taken possession of
their newly acquired property.
Mr. Rice's original investment in
this land represents about $1700. He
located a homestead here only a few
years ago, but later purchased land
adjoining. Last October, the New
Ions, drilling on the ranch, struck a
flow of artesian water. The result of
this discovery has been the transfor
mation within a year of an arid farm
Into a blooming garden spot. On the
bottom land, under a ditch flowing
with water the year around is now
one of the finest fields of oats in the
entire Northwest. The oats have al
ready attained a heighth of five and
six feet and will mane an enormous
yield. This is quite a contrast to the
sags brush and bunch grass which
covered this land less than a year ago.
At the present time the Newlons,
who have already spent in the neigh
borhood of $20,000 in sinking wells
in this county, are putting down an
other well on' the Rice farm and the
opening of another artesian well on
this ranch is now only a matter of
days from indications at this time.
In buying this property, Mr. and
Mrs. Newlon have the firmest belief
in the future development of this sec-
tion. They are laying extensive plans
which will eventually be carried out
on their ranches. Already; on their
farm, known as the old Millet farm,
demonstration farming is being con
ducted under the supervision of C. 'u.
"Farmer" Smith of the O-W. H. & X.
Co.
The Newlons will have the distinc
tion of being among the first
to introduce the silo into Mor
row county. On the Millet ranch will
be built a hundred-ton silo and on the
Rico farm a two hundred-ton silo will
be constructed. It is the intention of
the new owners to engage extensively
In the dairy business. For this pur
pose a fine herd of Holsteln cows will
be selected. All fanning will be con
ducted on the diversified plan in an
extensive manner and according to
scientific principles. The dawn of a
new era has about reached this sec
tion. People who have at heart the
development of the Northwest have
turned their eyes to this section of
Morrow county and new capital will
soon be coming this way.

venience to water users and can be

two screens In Umatilla county

TRESPASS CASE CLOSED
Barney Parks of Harne.v. Oregon
lndlcted for wIlfu, graz,ng tregpags
upon the MaIheur Natlonai Forest
( leaded ,u and
the United States Court on June 1!).
Parks paid his fine and the casa is
closed.
, Parks was in charge of sheep go
ing to their allotted range, and in
stead of following the regularly es
tablished driveway, trailed them a
cross the allotted cattle range of oth-
er stock owers, consuming four days
in, crossing and using about $100
worth of forage on the cattle men s
allotment. Instead of holding the
stjeep owner, who had no part in the
action, responsible for the wilful fea
ture of the case, the government
brought trespass charges against the
camptender with the result mention
ed above. This is the second case In
which an employee has been held
responsible for a trespass of this sort
in Oregon. It is believed that this
Court decision, fixing the responsibi
lity upon the man in charge of the
stock will stimulate employees to
comply with regulations and instruc
tions when handling stock on Na
tional Forest range.
' In the past, when herders or others
in charge of stock have refused to
observe the regulations and trespass
ed upon range allotted to other stock
man, the owner of the stock was held
entirely responsible. The govern
ment has now adopted the plan of
segregating such cases and criminal
ly prosecuting the man In charge of
the stock when he acts on his own
authority and wilfully violates the
grazing regulations.
The government undertakes to
give grazing permittees quiet posses
sion of the range allotted to them for
the use of their stock, and the action
In this case was necessary for the
protection of the cattle men whose
iSiutied '-range was trespassed -upon
by the sheep.

MENTioNnnOPS WILL MAKE
A BUMPER YIELD
Morrow County Harvest Crews Will
Soon Start to Garner One of the
Biggest Crops of History in a
Few Weeks. Quality of
Wheat Excellent.
An Inspection of the grain fields of
Morrow county this week prove to H19
observer that Morrow county is on
the verge of harvesting one of the
bumper crops of her history. The
only thing that has kept the county
from making a yield thousands of
bushels greater than any previous
crop is atlribuied to the late seasou
and the subsequent poor growing sea
son. Every section of the county will
make excellent yields. Crops through
the Lexington country are up to their
usual standard anl in many Instances
excell former year by a wide mar
gin. Here there are fields of grain
which will make all the way from
twenty to thirty-five bushels per acre.
Many farmers north of lone are
busy at this time cutting their hay,
and they have an abundance of it this
year. Soon they will begin the wheat
harvest. Some of the best fields in
the county He in this section. West
of lone and straight through south as
far as Hardman, the landscape Is one
continual stretch of growing grain,
the greater part of it being bluestein
wheat. It ia hard to find a really poor
field of wheat in the Gooseberry sec
tion. No estimates of grain production
in the county have yet been made,
since a large part of it is yet green
and in the process of filling. But it is
safe to say at this time, present
weather conditions prevailing, that
Morrow county will be the tanner
wheat producing county in Oregon
this year, if reports received from
neighboring wheat growing sections
are to be relied upon.
