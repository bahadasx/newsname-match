Big Program Planned Ball Game
and Booster Chase in Morning
Speaking in Afternoon.
Fully twenty - five families have
agreed to attend the Dairy Farmers'
Picnic to be held at the Walker Pol
lock farm on July 20th. These peo
ple are coming in the morning for an
all-day session. .Each family has
promised to turn out full force with
a basket lunch for the dinner, while
the necessary dairy products will be
provided by the Rock Spring Dairy.
The big event for the forenoon pro
gram will be a base ball game with
the dads on one side and the boys on
the other. A free-for-all rooster
chase wherein one White Leg
horn Rooster goes to the one who
catches him will show the best sprin
ter. These events and others that
are being planned are sure to prepare
every one for the big lunch that will
be spread.
For the afternoon program sev
eral of the local dairy farmers will tell
of how and why they are in the busi
ness of producing milk.
Mr. Ed. M. Lawder of the Lewder-
dale Farm, has recently imported a
young Holstein bull from Iowa of
which he is mighty proud. He will
tell why he selected this animal, why
he is breeding Hoi steins and of what
benefit such a sirs ls sure to be in his
herd. I
Mr. Lester Miller, of the Paramount
Stock Farm, has fane of the very few
milking Shorthorn herds in Missou
ri. He has the advantage of building
on the work his father has carried on
there for several, years, which puts
his ahead of the majority of such
herds. The late James J. Hill was an
admirer of this class of cattle and
Mr. Miller has agreed to tell of what
the work he started is now accom
plishing.
There is always an open question
with all who are considering buying a
few cows as to which is the best
breed.
