FINE ESTABLISHMENT
Mansfield Has Only Exclus
ive Undertaking Parlor
in Wright County
The only exclusive undertak
ing establishment in Wright
county is located at Mansfield,
owned and operated by T. F.
Lenhart, who is a funeral direc
tor and embalmer of wide ex
perience, being licensed to prac
tice embalming in three different
states Ohio, Oklahoma and Mis'
souri. This establishment is up
to date and would, do credit to a
city of many times the size of
Mansfield. Mr. Lenhart believes
in specializing in this profession,
therefore gives it all his time
and attention, keeping posted as
to the latest methods pertaining
to the work. His wife, having
taken up the work-under his
supervision, makes a valuable
assistant, especially in caring
for children and lady cases
where a woman's touch is need
ed. Not until recently has the
funeral director and embalmer
realized the necessity of the
woman-in the profession, and no
establishment is up to the min
ute unless it is the proud pos
sessor of a lady assistant. '
This establishment is located
in a brick building 25 ft. wide
and 80 ft. long, with a plate glass
front which affords a fine window
for flowers, which is used for
this purpose alone. Back of this
is- the office and reception or
waiting room, which can be used
also for a funeral chapel. There
is a long hall extending from the
front to the rear of the building,
which allows passage from the
front door to the bock of the
building without coming in con-.,
tact with any funeral furnish
Hngs,- After pasSirfg,-thav offioeJ
and. waiting room by. going down
the hallwy,;tber. Is an opening
to the left which leads into the
show room, where you will find
caskets, clothing, etc., from the
cheapest to the best. Mr. Lenr
hart has the reputation of carry
ing the finest line of goods in
this part of the state, especially
fine metal caskets, which he
takes pleasure in showing and
explaining to his many visitors.
After leaving the show room
and continuing down the hallway
you will come to the stock and
work room. In the northwest
corner or this room is located
the embalming room with table
and all necessary conveniences
for doing the work. Bodies can
be taken here and cared for with
as much secrecy as in the home.
The work room is used for up
holstering and trimming cas
kets. Mr. Lenhart does all this
work himself, being skilled
along this line. v?
In fact, you . will find in this
establishment all that goes to
make a complete, up to date
place of this kind.
Mr. Lenhart located here about
four years ago and has brought
the business from a coffin-selling
proposition up to what it is to
day, one of the finest places in
Southern Missouri," and in place
of the old varnished coffin .and
hauling the dead to their , last
resting place in wagons you will
find a fine funeral car and sub
stantial wood and metal caskets
being used. V
He claims service is another
way of spelling success.
Mr. Lenhart is the Republican
candidate for coroner of Wright
county and deserves a big vote
at the primary Aug, 1.
