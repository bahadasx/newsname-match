Good Crowds Enjoy
Pickens Chautauqua
The citizens of Pickens have every
reason to feel gratified over the euooess
of the Chautauqua. It was a success
and the people enjoyed it. Despite the
rain on Saturday two good-sized -audi.
ences heard Dr. Daniel and the Colum.
bia Con- -t company and were well
repaid f( their trip in the rain to the
schoolhouse. Sunday morning Dr.ich
ner pleased a large audience at the
Methodist church. Monday afternoon
the sun came out, but it was still too
damp to hold the performances 'in the
tent and the school auditorium was
packed and jammed both afternoonand
night to see Durno and'company and
Eugene Lockhart. From' the applause
and laugbter it was evident that the
audience enjoyed every minute of the
entertainment.
iThe crowds Monday were so large
r 4fat it was decided to have the Tuesday
a ctions in the tent rain or shine.
Tues'day afternoon an immense crowd
braved the-ratn to hear Dr. Tincher and
the Alpine Yodlera, both of which. were
fine. And-Tuesday night the tent was
full and overflowing to hear these same
attractions. Tuesday morning Dr.
Grimm of the pellagraliospital of Spar
tanburg lectured to a lrge audience.
When it was first decided that Pick
ens was to have a chautauqua the plan
was to charge an admission fee, as is
generally done. But last Wednesday
afternoon the committee decided that in
order for everybody to get the benefit
to be derived from these entertainments
and to enjoy them and in order that
everybody might attend, it would be
best to give the chautauqua free.
The committee went to work solicit
ing subscriptions and in a surprisingly
ehort time the citizens of Pickens had
contributed enough money to pay for
the chautauqua and pay all incidental
* -expenses. Amounts ranging from $1
ito $10 were given. The business men
and all the people of Pickens responded
Sliberally-. Big, little, old. and4 young
were enthusiastic and all put their
shoulder to the wheel and pushed it to a
,uccessful finish.
.Pickens has done something that we
,doubt if another town in the state of
.South Carolina the size of Pickens has
done-reached down in her pocket, paid
for:a $500 chautauqua and gave it to the
people of this section absolutely free.
And the people appreciated and enjoyed
it, itoo.

In the Mountains of Pickens Co.
In company with John L. Scott of
Greenville and Rev. Walter Coker of
Anderson county the writer spent sev
eral days recently around Table Rock,
one of the most interesting sections of
the county, We made headquarters at
the new hotel which is at the base of
the rock in a beautiful location alniost
enclosed by mountain ridges. One may
rest here and drink pure sparkling water
from a nearby spring and study in the
stillness Interrupted only by the swish
Jn~g sound of the mounain brook.
We went one day into the cove on the
north of the rock on the headwaters of
the Saluda and had a chat with B. B.
Hooker, who owns a nice home. over
there. He has some fine corn and has
It well worked. . Another day we as
cended Mt. Pinnacle, commonly called
Bald Knob. Geography states that this
is the highest point in the state and one
who climbs it will readily agree with
the geography.
On the morning of July 4, with Henry
Zed Jones to pilot us, we went fishing.
Mr. Jones is all right and ever accom
modating as a mail carrier on route 6,
but he led us over a rocky road for fish
and the reward was small. To dispel
our disconsolate hearts we found on our
return to the hotel two happy picnic
parties. One from Pickens, consisting
of A. D. Attaway, Mr. Meredith, Mrs.
Powell, Misses Margaret, Sara, Jonnie,
Eula and Glennie Attaway, Mattie Fin
ley, Lura Pickens, May Pepper and Nell
Smith. With them we enjoyed dinner.
Mr. Scott ate so much he couldn't talk
after dinner.
The other party was from Easley and
consisted of R 'v. H. K. Williams and
P. M. Taylor and their families witb
Miss Bess Burton, of Newberry. It
rained in the afternoon preventing a
climb on the Rock.
While around Table Rock we met
many Masters. One family, that of W.
A. Masters, furnished us with the best
of butter, buttermilk and beans. Mr.
Masters is in his eightieth summer but
does a man's work on the farm.. He has
a beautiful home.
. We stoppe& with Amos C. Suther
land and family and Mr. and Mrs. Hen
ry Jones at Oolenoy a short while and
were glad to be among thesehospitable
folks. That is a fine section of a great
county they live in. And the man who
owns Table Rock with .its scenery, sum
mer resort and surroundings should
count himself a millionaire. H. H.
Birthday Reunion
On July 2 the friends and relatives
of J. H. Riggins gathered at his home
to celebrate his 35th birthday. It was
quite a surprise to him, but from the
kindness shown and the nice talk that
he made, it was surely appreciated. He
owns a nice farm on Liberty route 3
and is a prosperous farmer, and he and
his family are held-in high esteem in
their community. If you could have
been there and could have seen the big
crowd and all the good things to eat,
you would not ask why was all this
crowd at his home. The table was
spread in the grove with all kiuds of
good things to eat, and after all had
partook of these good things, we gath
ered around the organ. His brothers
and other good singers led in the music
and we had some good singing. Mr.
Riggins is the second son of A. B. Rig
gins of Liberty. There were 100 people
present and we all had a good time, and
all said good-bye late in the afternoon
and made their way home. N. P.
.ing this chautauqua a success. And the
immense audiences that have attended
shows the appreciation of the people of
this section.
The outstanding features of the great
Radcllffe chautauqua were the two ad
dresses Saturday by Dr. D. Wistar
Daniel, and he lives down here at Clem
son College, in Pickens.
Some folks say there's always room
for onr more, but we don't see how one
more could have gotten Into the audi
torium Monday night to see Durno and
Lockhart.
Durno's trunk and bag mystery is
some mystery all right, and though we
have been told many times just how It
was done by those who caught on, we
are still unable to do the trick.
The people of Pickens are indebted to
that popular, enterprising, progressive
and Indefatigable young lawyer, Sam
B. Craig, for the interest he has taken
in solieiting the fund for the chautaui
qua.____
And the best part of it is, we're go
)ing to have the chautauqua again next
year on a bigger scale than ever.

Campaign Meetings
The campaign meetings for the Third
longressional district have been ar
anged. The campaign schedule for
ickens county is as follows: Pickens,
rhursday, July 27; Easley, Friday, July
8; Central, Saturday, July 29. The
ampaign meetings begin at Pickens on
he 27th and wind up at the Orr mill'at
knderson on the night of August 24.
The schedule for the county cam
iaign has not yet been arranged.
dachine Installed as Bookkeepet
The Pickens Bank has just installed
machine that will actually keep books.
"he Burroughs Adding Subtracting ma
hine is the name of this mechanical
iookkeeper and it will be used for mak
ng entries to the bank's ledgers and
vriting up depositors' statements.
To understand best what this machine
neans to a busy bank one must see it
n actual operation. A great number
f checks naturally come into the bank
laily and each must pass through the
'egular channels. A record must be
nade of each one and the account of
ach depositor must be handled sepa
ately and accurately.
Before the advent of the machine,
he detail work of entering amounts in I
he ledger and making out depositors'
tatements was a tiresome and uncer
ain task. All checks had to be listed
eparately and added up by hand. All
leposits had to be listed and added and
heir total combined with the customer's
Id balance. When that was ddne the
otal of all checks had to be deducted
rom the sum of old balance and depos
ts to determine the new balance.
GREAT LABOR-SAVER
'With the new Burroughs, all this is
lone miechanically, except the actual
ietting down of the figures on the key
)oard. And' the balancing of an ac
:ount, from ldid balance on through
!hecks and deposits to new balance, is
virtually handled in one operation. ,
The operator first feeds the custom
er's old balance into the machine. Then
he sets down the amount of eaeh check;
enters the amount of the deposit; and,
after taking a spacing stroke, depres
ses the operating bar with the tota- key
:own and the correct new balance is
automatically computed and. printed in
.he right hand column. The machind
kiso automatically prints the dates op
>osite each list of checks and deposits,
md without any attention from the op
,rator, sets each in the column in which
t belongs.
Another thing it does is to detect ov
,rdrafts instantly, whether the operat
or notices them or not. When the
hecks exceed the deposits and the old
>alance, the machine automatically
ocks and no results can be obtained un
il the lever controlling the internal
nechanism is placed in the "subtract"
)osition, when the overdraft is printed
n the proper column with an "OD"
ign in red ink.
With the use of the machine, the
ickens Bank's books are kept more
neatly, accurately and efficiently than
hey could possibly be kept by hand.
['he machine method cuts out unneces
asry labor and eliminates mistakes.
ACCOUNTS STAY BAIANCED)
In addition to p)ostirig the ledgers, the
lurroughs makes out monthly state
nents for depositors. Each statement
hows all the checKs and deposits of
he customer, together with the balance
me has in the bank at the efld of the
nonth. Under' this system each cus
,omer's account is kept balanced all the
ime and a statement is ready for him
it the end of the month, or at any time
e wants it, on live minutes notice.
M'oreover he does not have to bother
with bringing in his pass hook to be
alanced. Beirig made on the machine
md checked back with the ledger sheets
--of which they are an exact duplicate
-the statements will of course be ab
olutely accurate.
This system is similar to that now in
ise in the most progressive banks in
he country and marks another step, in
he Pickens Bank's effort to give the,
nost complete and satisfactory service
o depositors. -(Adv).
And Still We Have April Showers

Oolenoy, July 10.-On 'the.29th ult',
at the advanced age 'of 93* years, the
soul of Mrs. Margaret Keith Edens
passed into the great Beyond. At the
time of her death she was muking hqr.
lome with her son, .Elijah Q.7E.dens.
She was married at an ear)' age to
Alexander Edens. Unto this.u4 were.
torn eleven children. Of this' unbor
10 were reared to maturity. Her huw
band preceded her to the grave 62 yea
It was at this time- that her abili
% business woman was demonstrated.
1er difficulties were many but with herl "
3ver ready energy as well as /an acthre
mind she found force to resist them. At'
the beginning of the war between the
states four of her oldest boys answeted
the call of their country. Thus she wae
again left with only the smaller children
ror help. But that fortitude and brav
3ry so characteristic of our Southern
women belonged to her. Though heavy
>dds were against her she succeeded in
tolding her own. Physically she was a
won~er. Never did she consult a phys
ician nor receive any treatment from
tem. Simple home remedies were her
resort. She leaves 249 grand and great
grandchildren and the following living.
-hildren: Mesdames Mary Jane Roper
and Rebecca Williams, E. C., P. N. B.,
Robt., Samuel, A. K. and W. E. Edens,
Sr. The fuferal was conducted by her
pastor, Rev. W. C. Seaborn, in the
presence of a large audience which at
tested the esteem in which she' .was
4eld. Her hospitable home, wheie so
many visited, her kind disposition hold
a tender place in our hearts. And
"Somewhere in the hilltops of that
country that knows no pain, she will
stand in her beautiful doorway and bid
us welcome again."
Miss Pearl Southerland attended the
Winthrop examination at the county
