presidential election.
Inquiry fails to bring out which
party the Indian voters will sup
port this year at the election. The
Indians generally seem to disregard
party questions and only believe
they should stand by those who
may stand by them and their in
terests in Congress.
A certain clique here has been
working a double game on the
faction that has fought the Burch
Howard Daniels combination to a
finish, by pretending to support
the progressives of the reservation
as against the combination and the
warehouses. Issues have counted
some and they should be brought
out more fully now.
Chippewas Of Wisconsin
And Minnesota Should
Consolidate.
'The organ of the Chippewas ot
Wisconsin, The Odanah Star, in
commenting upon an article which
recently appeared in THE TOMA
HAWK relative to the Right of Nom
ination Bill now pending bi-foro
Congress has this to say:
"The above measure is one lhat
every Indian Tribe in the country,
should boost for passage, us it
meansmuch to the Indians of to
day. Much credit is due the Min
nesota Chippewas for the fact that
it is through their efforts aud
labors that the measure has been
held prominently before Congress
and while it not alone means much
for them, but the entire country,
they have not one moment faltered
in their labors to secure its pass
ages at'd we believe that it is time
our people in Wisconsin awake to
the fact that a little of this same'
push may be the means of parch
ing victory on the tight for pass
age of the Right of Nomination
measure.
Several years ago much was said
of the measure here but on account
of no organizition such as they
have in Minnesota, the matter died
a national death. We believe the
time is now ripe to follow the ex
ample set by the Chipp-was of
Minnesota and perfect an organi
ition for the betterment of our
conditions, which to day is worse
than they were in balmy days of
1909 to 1911-12. Then the people
were considered s-imply- savages
but under the leadership of The
Star at that time, the \iay v,assecuring
paved for better surroundings and
usages.
While the Star to day is not at
war with anyone, we wish to saylivan,
that we have material for several
very "spicy'' articles, but that is
I-I,
Mlcb^oir^r arW-ne:
THE
the United States, under treaties
made while they were being treat
ed with as a nation, and the
several bands referred to should
consolidate by 'organizing into a
national council for the purpose of
taking steps to prosecute their
united claims against the govern
ment. The nearest tribesmen of
Chippewas of Minnesota are
the Wisconsin Chippewas and steps
should be taken to consolidate in a
general council with them at least.
Protest Against Delep-
Unfortunately for the original
Beaulieu family of this reservation,
Theo. H. Bcauheu, formerly of
Wisconsin, has taken advantage of
the situation for a number of years
and tried to build himself up
peramong
sonally upon the reputation of the
family among the Indians.
It has reached a point now where
the members of the original family
who have had placed upon them
the burdens of the Wisconsin
crowd of that name, to protest
against any representations of
Theo. H. Beaulieu so that he may
not be confused with the original
family of Beaulieus.
The latest information which has
come to the members of the origi
nal family is that Theo Beaulieu
and others have protested against
the selection of the delegation that
left for Bemidji last Monday to at
tend I he meeting of the General
Council of Minnesota Chippewas,
but the grounds for the protest is
not known at this time.
A telegram received from Wash
ington simply conveys the w^-i
ouaionllmtT:heo.J^Jaaiuilmii_aj^:^_.o "r
others, who are known here, have
protested against the payment of
the expenses of the delegation.
Theo H. Beaulieu's standing as
a member of the Minnesota band.*
was obtained only through the
assistance of some of the old mem
bers of the original family from
motives of charity at that time, but
now he is assuming to interpose
objections to Indian councils be
cause the Indians have not any con
fidence in him, and those who have
recently joined him, and whose
highest ambitions are to obtain
government positions, and, there
fore, did not elect them as dele
gates.
The original Beaulieus of this
reservation wish the members
thereof, and of other reservations
in this state, to know that they are
in no way in sympathy with the
actions of Theo. H. Beaulieu and
his son Frank, who is of course
assisting his father in trying to de
feat the council and the work of
the delation that went to Wash
ington during the past winter, and
who apparently still have the
invoulidt
terests of the old Howard regime
at heart more than of the Chippe
was of Minnesota.
Soldier Boys.
Recently a recruiting officer of
the United States army came to
this reservation for the purpose of
recruits among the Indian
boys of the reservation and he sue
ceeded in getting five, namely
Paul Roy, John Percy, John Sul
George Fairbanks and Bryan
Richardson.
But three of the boys were re-

Much to the amusement of the*r.her
is well known that one of them
has had lung troubles in the past
and the other is quite deaf.
John Sullivan passed a physcial
examination but is unable to read
or write in English although he
speaks the language as well as any
ordinary, uneducated man.
The officers were very anxious
that the examination rules shpuld
be suspended in young Sullivan's
case and that he be accepted,' be
cause he broke thirteen out of fif
teen glass balls at target practice.
Thirteen proved an unlucky num
ber for John.
Geo. Fairbanks had a crooked
thumb and for this reason only,
was rejected. George s.iysthis
would not have prevented him from
bringing down nine out of every
ten Mexicans he would have bhot
at, but Sullivan says he would not
have missed any of them.
There was much disappointment
the intimate friends of
George Fairbanks because he isf
the grandson of the late celebrated
Chippewa chief UoIe-in-the-day
who was the greatest warrior his
tribe ever produced, and it was
hoped that George might develop
some of the fighting qualities of
his illustrious ancestor
But George's friends should be
consoled by the fact that William
Hole-in the day has enlisted and
is now at Fort Lincoln in North
Dakota, where he is stationed with
his regiment preliminary to start

if there is any lighting blood in
the descendants of Ilole-in-the-day,
it might come out in William.
