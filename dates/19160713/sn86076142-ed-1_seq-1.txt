WASHINGTON, July 13. State
department officials anticipate many
bothersome questions in connection
with the status of the DeutBchland.
The contention of the French and
British embassies that she is a poten
tial warship is given little weight In
view of the department's Informa
tion that the vessel Is purely a mer
chant craft.
Consideration has been given the
suggestion of the government to with
hold news of the boat's sailing to
prevent Information reaching the al
lies. Under the ruling that the craft
vat to come to Inspect the Deutsch-J jg a merchant vessel the department
Miild not countenance sinking or
violence by international law.
Warships are reported to be gath
ering around the heads watching for
the departure of the undersea boat
of the coming of the Bremen, which
is said to be nearing the three mile
limit. Should either of the sub
marine merchant vessels be de
stroyed while at sea there cannot be
any redress as they become legiti
mate prey for enemy ships the min
ute they pass out of the domestic
beach line. No mercy will be shown
and either vessel will be Bunk on
sight.
