Bliss, Assistant Chief of Staff.
WASHINGTON. July 12.—Informal
negotiations for settlement of border
disputes between the United States
and the de facto government of Mexi
co are "progressing favorably," Acting
Secretary Polk said today after bis
second conference with Eliseo Arre
dondo, Mexican ambassador-designate.
Although Mr. Polk would not add to
this statement, it is understood that it
is now assured the steps being taken i
foreshadow appointment of commis
sioners by each government to formu
late a plan of action for the permanent
relief of border conditions. Mr. Arre
dondo has not disclosed what his in
structions are, but from other sources
it has been learned that the commis
sion plan was favored by General Car
ranza and his ndvisers and they will
not be opposed by the state depart
ment. A formal announcement is ex
pected soon.
Whether the questions submitted to
tlie commission will follow the defini
tion of the matters in dispute laid
down in General Carranza's latest note
is not known, although Secretary Lan
sing's reply virtually accepted that
definition. The Mexican note said the
reasonable anxiety of the United
fctates on the one hutul over the secur
ity of its borders, and the feeling of
the de facto government, on the other,
that the continued presence of Ameri
can troops in Mexico menaced friendly
relations, constituted the problem to
which a solution must be found.
There are no present indications
that a commission would go into ques
tions dependent upon the main issues,
but' not directly involved in a settle
ment. It is believed probable, how
ever that the whole subject of inter
national conditions In Mexico, includ
ing the financial stress there, would bo
reviewed to some extent, with the pos
sible result of some more far-reaching
plan being proposed than the one em
bracing border conditions only.
AWAIT BLISS' COMING.

Army officers here were convinced to

THREE TALKS TO BE MADE TO
DAY AT THE CHAMBER OF COM
MERCE NOON EVENT.
HERDSMAN ONE OFTHE SPEAKERS
The Chamber of Commerce noonday
luncheon at Willard's grill today will
be one of particular interest to all
members. Three speakers are slated
to appear, the principal one being J
C. Herbsman, fore-runner lor the
Chautauqua which will be given in
lewistown during the middle of Au
gust. Mr. Herbsman is himself a
platform lecturer whose name is promi
nent in national lyceum bureaus.
Glowing accounts follow him from
every city lie has visited this year, and
local business men will find it well
wortli their while to hear him. He
is an eloquent and magnetic speaker,
and .more than that, he has something
of real interest to say.
Another interesting item of today's
luncheon will be the professional talk
h.v Dr. Wallin, city health officer, on
infantile paral.vsiR and its absolute pre
vention in this city. Dr. Wallin at-,
ready has posited bulletins pertaining
to this disease and will elaborate upon
the suggestions given therein.
The third speaker of tile day will be
Ed Baker, who has recently received
bis decree from the law school at Val
parlso, Ind.. For reasons, the subject
upon which Mr. Baker will speak will
rot be announced, but his talk will
have a very direct bearing upon one
of the chief purposes of this luncheon.
For the first time since the inaugur
ation of these bi-weekly luncheons, the
gathering will be held at Willard's
grill. Mr. Willard has recently remod
eled his grill room so that that the us
ual luncheon number ran easily be ac
commodated, and all live, active mem

LINE PROJECT
MONTANA POWER COMPANY TO
CONSTRUCT ONE FROM TWO
DOT TO LEWISTOWN
IT IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT
Tlie Montana Power company has
decided definitely upon the construc
tion of a transmission line from Two
Dot to Lewistown. This line will ex
tend from Two Dot to Harlowton,
through Judith Gap, thence to Lewis
town and connect here with ttie pres
ent line now in service between Rain
bow and this city, making a complete
belt. As it now is, a line extends
trom Volta to Two Dot, from Volta to
Rainbow and from Rainbow to Lewis
town. The new connecting line will
absolutely protcet the service not only
of Lewistown, but all towns along the
line, and the Milwaukee electrifica
tion, us current may be transmitted in
several directions.
At Harlowton.
The new line will carry 100,000 volts
irom Two Dot to Harlowton and will
be reduced there to 50,000 und trans
mitted at that voltage. At Harlow
ton a large sub-station will bo installed
and men will probably be stationed
there for patrol and other duties. The
Montana Power company lias obtained
an option on the distribution system
ot Harlowton, now owned by the Har
lowton Light & Water company, com
posed of Frank Goss, formerly of Lew
it.town, L. H. Hamilton of Great Fulls,
A. W. Warr of Lewistown and Ben
Stephens of Harlowton. The power
company.will unquestionably take tills
over before expiration of the option.
Will Wire Judith Gap.
Arrangements ure now under way to
wire Judith Gup for a distribution sys
tem und electric service will be given
tills town us soon as a line ran reach
there. Two men are now on the
ground, one locating the line und at
tending to (lie survey and tlie other
checking materials and attending to
locatiou of distributing systems in
Harlowton und Judith Gap.
Apparatus to Lewistown Station.
Apparatus lias been ordered for the
Lewistown power plant, as the new
line will require considerable addition
al equipment. This line was antici
pated when (lie substation here was
l uilt. so that provision bus been made
lor the installation of new apparatus
without taxing the station's capacity.
Material Arriving.
Material for the new project is now
arriving, two cars having already been
unloaded at Lewistown, two at Two
Dot and iwo were received at Harlow
ton yesterday. It is estimated that the
entire construction work and installu
tion of apparatus will, under ordinary
conditions, be consummated in about
four months.
This will mean employment for a
large number of men, for the work is to
be pushed through to completion. Lo
cations have been made and surveying
trews will soon be at hand. Lewis
town will he headquarters and distrib
uting center for work all along the
line.

The. most important railroad news |
of the past year, so far as Lewistown
at,d Fergus county are concerned, and
perhaps of the state, was confirmed
Sunday night and it will certainly ho
a most cheering announcement to
our people.
The Democrat is prepared to
state, upon the highest authority, that
the Great Northern lias definitely com
pleted arrangements for a resumption
of work at this end of the New Rock
ford, IjCwlstown und Great Fulls cut
off. Of course the work out from Now
Rockford and elsewhere on the eastern
portion of tlie extension is very im
portant. but it is far less interesting
to Fergus county than the fact that,
in a comparatively short time the
work of taking out (lie bench in the
2 500 foot tunnel, seven miles east of
the city will begin. Bill it is not Just
tunnel work that is to be started here
this year. The work of grading right
out from Lewistown to the tunnel will
be completed, and from there on grad
ing will be continued to Grass Range.
Tile survey to the latter point will
be cross-sectioned. It is going to take
2.500,000 feet of timbers for the long
tunnel and il will lie necessary lo have
lhe track in very soon. Seventy-five
per cent of the grading to the tunnel
lias already been done. It will, of
course, need dressing und shaping up.

WASHINGTON, July 12.—Although
state department officials virtually are
convinced that the German submarine
Deutschland Is strictly a merchant ves

probably will be sought before a final

Acting Secretary Folk indicated In
lay that the ruling would not be de

tomorrow. Il is understood lie consld

This information may lie rommunieut

warships are said now to be searching
for the convoy ship.
Various rumors Indicating that the
submarine might Ituve hud a convoy
have reached the stale department,
but none of them ever was given cred
ence. One was that a British steam
er which | ill into tin- Mil (lei in islands
had sighted, on June 22, in the At

The state department alreudy bus

The air of mystery surrounding all
discussion of the Deutschland's de
parture was deepened today by re
ports that her clearance papers may
not be made public when filed, thus
preventng notice of her leaving be
ing obtained.
It became known late today that
several conferences have been held

Ocean Navigation company and the
Krupp Steel company and Simon
Luke, Inventor of the submarine. This
gave rise to reports that a company
was in process of forming for the

Uncle Sam Sends Protest
to Lawbreaking Turkey
WASHINGTON. July 12.—Vig
orous protest has been made by
the United States to the Turk
ish government against the ac
tion of the governor general of
Syria in breaking into French
and British consulates at Beirut
and carrying off their archives
after the American consul gen
eral there had placed the seal
of the United States on their
doors. It became known here
today that many prominent Sy
rians recently executed by the
Turks were condemned because
their names appeared in papers
taken from the violated consu
lates. According to official In
formation the mere presence p*
the names in the consular rec
ords served as a death warrant
without further proof ot anta
gonism to the Turkish onidfi
ment. When the Turkish gov
ernor demanded access to the
British and French consulate pa
pers, W. Stanley Hollis, the
American consul general, not
only refused it, but applied to
the American embassy at Con
stantinople. which filed a formal
remonstrance with the porte.
Even this was unavailing. The
papers were taken and still are
