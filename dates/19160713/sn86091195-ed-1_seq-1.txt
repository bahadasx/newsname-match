SHELLEY'S SCRIBE
MAKES DENIAL
Joe Adams, the boosting editor of the |
Shelley Pioneer, was in the city Tues
day and was very indignant, and really
seemed to be offended, at the report
published in this paper last week that
John Barleycorn took a prominent part
in the late 4th of July celebration. He
declares he never saw a more sober or
sane celebration in his life, and that
the 100 quarts of Sunnybrook captured
by the sheriff yeas cached in the north
ern border of the town and belonged to
Idaho Falls bootleggers. He is quite
sure that he never saw a single Shelley
ite with a 4th of July jag, a miracle
that Shelley should be proud of.
The three men whom one of the dep
uty sheriffs saw dressed up and sleep
ing in the street possibly were not
drunk, and may not have been denizens
of Joe Adams' temperance town, but
they evidently did not carry their load
of Sunnybrook very far from where
they fell in the celebration. It is so
long since the good Joseph has been un
der the influence of the forbidden
juice that possibly he cannot recognize
its effects when he secs it.
He says the bank is flourishing un
der the new management, and that the
community spirit has harmonized for
progress and prosperity, and that a new
era of building and business activity
is apparent on every hand. Among the I
many proposed structures is a new bank, *
which seems necessary to accommodate
its increasing and permanent business.
He also stated that the prospect for a
sugar factory by the independent sugar
company of Salt Lake is very encour
aging.
SENATOR THOMAS HERE.
Senator L. B. Thomas, of the law
firm of Thoinhs & Anderson, of Blaek
foot, was in the city Tuesday defending
the interests of Chris Anderson and
wife. The contestant in the case was
Melvin Rushton, and he was represent
ed by Attorney Hamilton Wright, of
Blackfoot. The hearing was before C.
E. Oles, notary, involving two desert
entries ns to whether the land is desert
in character or not.
Senator Thomas says that Blackfoot
is going along at a splendid rate; that
they are building a $100,000 hotel, be
sides doing a lot of street paving; that
everybody has a job, and that business
is good. In speaking of Idaho Falls,
the senator said that he did not know
of a town in the State which was mak
ing the headway of this city.—Idaho
Falls Times.
The Junior Bee Hive girls of the
Latter Day Saints church gave a char

SHELLEY GRIST MILL BURNED
A destructive fire last Friday com
pletely destroyed the big Shelley flour
mill at Sheiley, Idaho. We under
stand the old mill was insured for all
it was worth, as were about seven tons
of grain that was in the mill at the time
of the fire, when there was no flour on
hand, the mill not having been running
for several weeks prior to its mysteri
ous destruction- It is most likely that
the Shelley Mercantile Company will
build a new and modern mill, but it
will be near the railroad right of way,
at the head of Main, street. The old
mill was on the Snake river bank, in
a very disadvantageous location.
A BOOSTING FISHER.
C. V. Fisher, cashier of the I). W.
Standrod & Co. bank of Blackfoot, and
one of the baord of directors of the Mud
Lake Canal company, attended a meet
ing of the board of that company here
Monday night. Mr. Fisher says the
Blackfoot fair this fall is to be the best
they have ever had, particularly the
race meet. A big number of outside
horses have been entered.—Idaho Falls
Register.
GONE AFTER THE GIRL.
Deputy Sheriff Dana is in Nebraska
in search of a Miss Dyson, formerly of
Aberdeen, whose father is now in the
Bingham county jail awaiting trial on
a charge of incest, alleged to have been
committed on her. She is said to be in
a delicate condition owing to the crim
inal intimacy existing for many years
with her sire, against who mshe will be
a witness, as her brother is.
BLACKFOOT VS. POCATELLO.
The most interesting and best game
of base ball this season took place at
the fair grounds Sunday, when Black
foot met the Pocatello team. Both
teams played exceedingly well, the
score being 3 to 1 in favor of Black
foot. The Pocatello team won a game
with Salt -Lake City last week, so in
winning this game Blackfoot is now up
with the big teams.
The past several games played on
the Blackfoot diamond have been a
great injury, which can lie remedied by
a few more games like that of last
Sunday, when all cheerfully admitted
they got their money's-worth.
The game was fast from the start,
but two eju'ors being recorded,-and tiros' 1
against Pocatello.
The Blackfoot battery was Keltus
and Sorenson. Hoolihnn anil Zeiberth
worked for Pocatello.
A PROMISING RAILROADER.
We are very authoritatively' informed
that the special Sunday rates and week
end rates that are destined to become
so pleasant for the people and profitable
for the railroad company', were first
promulgated by our esteemed local
agent, W. L. Young, who is certainly
entitled to some distinction as a popular
and profitable rate-maker.
MAIN STREET
FRANC!
IPUR
ISE GRANTED
Tuesday a special meeting of the
city council was called to order by
Mayor Peck, a full quorum being pres
ent.
The object of the meeting was the
consideration of a franchise asked by
the Oregon Short Line Railroad for n
spur track across Main street to ac
commodate the Anderson & Son 's lum
ber yard in the Tanner addition, in
Block 8, for a period of fifty years.
The franchise was granted, but the
city reserves the right to grant a fran
chise to any other person to cross
said spur. Also, that all grades and
fills be made under the direction of the
city engineer. Also that the street be
kept unobstructed, and that no cars
cross the street without an engine.
Ordered, that the city attorney draft
an amended franchise to be submitted
to the railroad company for their ap
proval.
The ordinance granting the franchise
was passed by an aiflrmntive vote of
all the councilmen but Pelkey, who op
posed the franchise.
Councilman Pelkey opposed the
granting of the franchise for several
reasons. One was that he did not be
lieve it a necessity for the company to
have the desired track across the street,
inasmuch as the other two lumber com
panies here did business and prospered
and hauled their lumber by teams from
the cars to their yards. Another reason
was that he did not believe in crossing
the main thoroughfare with railroad
spurs, or establish a precedent of do
ing so. He contended that if one com
pany was allowed to do so, others could
not be denied the same privilege, and in
course of time he believed that other
similar'concessions would be asked,

Kav took the floor in behalf of the
DEATH OF MARY TOLMIE-STRONG
Mary Tolmie-Strong, daughter of
Donald and Izabella Tolmie, was born
at Soda Springs, Idaho, April 25, 1884,
and died July 8, 1916, at Aiperican
Falls, Idaho, aged 82 years and 8
months. She was married to George
W, jJtrong on September 1, 190J.
Deceased was taken ill the evening
before her death, and was removed to
the hospital early Mouday' morning.
Everything possible was done to relieve
lier suffering, but to no avail, and death
came at 4:20 Monday afternoon. Word
was telephoned to her mother, brother
and sisters, who reside near Blackfoot,
of her serious condition, who immedi
ately started for American Falls in au
tomobiles, but failed to reach here in
time to see the patient alive.
Mary was born in Soda Springs, Ida
ho, 82 years ago. From her childhood
she had always been energetic and am
bitious, always ready to assist whero
her services might do good to the sick
or needy, We have personally known
her for nineteen y'ears, and know that
her desire to do good unto others and
assist whenever opportunity called was
her disposition. Her untimely and sud
den death was a severe shock to the
many' who have felt her helping hand
in time of need. To her husband,
daughters, mother, sisters and brothers,
and other relatives, nothing could cause
them greater sorrow or pain.
Her father and a sister, first born
child, are buried at Soda Springs, her
former home, to which place the re
mains were taken for burial Wednes
day morning after funeral services
held in the Methodist church here, of
which she was a member, Rev. J. Wes
ley Miller oiliciating.
Mary was a member of the local Ro- j
bekali lodge and Ladies of Woodcraft, i
and a most active worker. Beautiful
floral offerings eovered the coffin, fur- j
nished by' her sister lodge members and
the Knights of Pythias and I. U- O. F. ]
lodges, of which George, her husband,
is a member, besides others contributed j
by many friends in the city.
The remains, were accompanied to '
Soda Springs by peorge Strong and two
daughters, Mrs. Tolmie, George and
John Tolmie, Mrs. Marguerite Gonway,
Rev. J. Wesley Miller and Undertaker
Hager.
The. I. O. O. F. and Rebekah lodgoi
of Soda Springs took charge of the
funeral at that place.
She leaves to mourn, her husband
George W. Strong, her two daughters,
Myrtle, 8 years of age, and Marguerite,
5 years of age; Mrs. Elizabeth Tolmie,
of Shelley, four brothers, George, John,
Donald and Norman, also of Shelley;
four sisters. Mrs. Katherine Hansen,
of Blackfoot; Mrs. Marguerite Con
way, Hannah and Frances Tolmie, all of
Shelley, Idaho.—Power County Times.
GOOD CROPS AND GOOD PRICES!
The hay and grain crops of this sec-1
tion of Idaho were never betted than 1
they will be this year. Some of the
dry land crops will also be good in this
immediate vicinity, but in some places
they are a total loss. The small fruits
will also be plenty, but potatoes and
beets not as good as usual. One of our
farmers says that his first hay crop will
be later than last year, but some better.
With better crops and much better
prices, 1916 will be a very profitable
year for our farmers.
The county commissioners, county at
torney and sheriff leave next Tuesday
for the Willow Creek country i*>r the
purpose of establishing voting precincts
and school districts.
franchise, on the ground that more
trajjes meant more business and a larger
efty.
This is the same franchise that was
asked for several weeks ago by the An
derson & Son Lumber Co. It was
then presented to the council, and with
drawn for the alleged reason that its
petitioners had a tip that it would not
meet with the approval of the city
solons. The only- difference is that
thjfcn it was presented to the council by
thfl local representative of the Eccles
Inprestmut Company. This time it was
presented by the Oregon Short Line
Railroad Company, and was brought to
the council by Councilman DeKay, who
was its most ardent advocate. Alex
ander Younie, an ex-councilman and
president of the First National Bunk,
was present and admonished the coun
cil not to give the lumber company an
exclusive franchise, and his advice was
gladly received and adopted.
Councilman Thompson insists that
the franchise would have passed when
it was first proposed had it not been
withdrawn before the council had a
chance to vote on it.
There being tjo bids for the building
of the Chalmers sidewalk, the time of
receiving such bills was extended until
July' 18.
The city engineer was instructed to
place 9-foot gutter plates in place of
6-fOot platVs on Main street.
Herman Stufflebeam was present and
asked by what right the Idaho Wuter
Power Company placed a certain pole
on Shilling avenue in front of his resi
dence, which he threatened to cut down
if not removed
Moved and seconded that the city po
lice be requested to stop all reckless
and illegal auto driVing, by arresting
all violators of the speed ordinance.

NEW ROAD TO PARADISE.
This week the county commissioners
dedicated a new road to the many set
tlers of Paradise Valley and vicinity,
do their shopping. This productive val
ley is about forty miles distant from
this city, over the old Fort Hall road,
and a long stretch of almost impassable
saml. The sandy obstruction has been
avoided by going through Louis Moss
lin's ranch, which makes the road not
only better, but much shorter.
The county pays Mr. Messlin $400
for the right of way through his ranch,
half of which is to be paid by Rube
Dunn.

A FORTUNATE ACCIDENT.
Last Monday morning the 5-year old
daughter of Ed Turpin, of Thomas,
met with a very serious accident. While
her mother was operating a gasoline
power washing machine the little one
got lier arm entangled in the gearing,
and if it had not been for the prompt
action of her mother in •shutting off the
power, the little one's arm would have
been torn from the shoulder. The little
girl was brought to* Blackfoot to be
examined by Dr. Patrie, who found
that no bones had been broken, but
that the arm was badlv wrenched.
WHERE WILL THE FED
ERAL BUILDING BE?
Now that $65,000 is about to be ap
propriated for a federal building in
Blackfoot for n postoflice and other pur
poses, the most advantageous and
economical site seems to be the main
topic, among some of our citizens. The
site will be selected by' the treasury de
partment and will not be far from the
depot ami centrally located. Many
sites have already been mentioned, but
the most popular one is the corner of
East Main and Bridge, owned by the
Rowles estate. It is central, spacious
and handy for the railroad company to
deliver and receive the mail, a very im
portant feature in the selection of a
postoflice site.

NO ADMINISTRA
TION BUILDING
Leslie Dillingham, the Mackay scribe
and one of the directors of the State
insane asylum, returned home yester
day morning after attending a meeting
of the board. He says the institution
is doing as well as eould be expected,
and will soon have a surplus of $40,000
on hand. He says that the proposed ad
ministration building, to cost $30,000
out of the earnings of the asylum, can
not be built, owing to poiitieai opposi
tion. He also says that the $800 apple
crop of last year is a total failure, but
that the rest of the agricultural pro
duct of the institution is very good.
Mr. Dillingham informs us that the
report of a possible sugar factory in
the Arcoe country has been circulated
by the Utah Construction Co., for the
purpose of getting the support and sym
pathy of the people of that vicinity in
order to sell land under the notorious
Mackay dam, which ne does not think
can be rebuilt at the present site with
safety and profit.
TO INSPECT ROUTE OF
NEW RAILROAD
Pocatello, July, 10.—It is stated that
representatives of an eastern bonding
house and engineering company are ex
pected to arrive in Pocatello within n
short time for the purpose of going
over the route of the proposed Rock
laud und Arbon Valley railroad.
It is understood that this trip is be
ing made preparatory to financing the
road, which will Inter be extended to
Idaho Falls and Blackfoot, and from
there to Lander, Wyo., where it will
connect with the Chicago & Northwest
ern system.
The distance from Idaho Falls to
Lander is about 150 miles, but the
Northwestern has never made this ex
tension because of a traffic arrangement
with the Union Pacific.'—Pocatello

foot this week visiting his family and
friends. Mr. Johnston says he is en
gaged in the most pleasant and profit
able work of imparting and receiving
information of State and church from
notable men and women from all parts
of the world, whose knowledge of Utah
and Idaho and the opportunities and
resources of these promising States are
very limited.
Jos. Hansen, of Presto, had a 15
