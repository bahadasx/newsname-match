DISEASE
Is Acustomed to Criticism, Which
Differs from Fault-Finding -Has
Crown in Effectiveness and
Takes a High Rank
Between criticism and fault
finding there is a wide gap. For
many years" Florida's State Board
.V of Health and its Health Officer
have been targets for both. The
Executive Officer of the Board
stands responsible at all times for
ar-y and everything written by
him or inserted in the publications
of the Board with Ins approval,
and furthermore, criticism is al
wavs welcome, even invited
Fault-finding is unfair because it
only points out a supposed defect,
ij. Z more or less imaginary, and
,s suggests no remedy. Often it
: 'i charges its self-judged culprits
v . with statements that have nevj
'is cr been made, even occa"
r siondly. when fired against the
V Florida State Board of Health or
'r Vita Executive Officer, with declar-
ations, the direct opposite of those
7;. th.it have been made and repeat
'. cdly emphasied.
The Board is accustomed to
'criticism. For a dozen years aft-
l'.eX its organization, in 1889, suc
cessive legislatures had the habit
at moving to abolish the Boardr
m- and the futile scheme was hatched
wj nP spasmodically thereafter, but
f':, always there has been the balance
of wisdom that defeated it. As
-jT the Board grew in experience and
enecuvenese. as miiuiiuoa was.
confined to narrower limits of ter-

iand other general prevalence of
i'i-' disease became lc3s frequent, the
';'a& work t the Board has been recog-
inized ar.d appreciated, and it
-V would be a bold man in these
years to suggest that it be wiped
- out. The press of the state with
rare and increasingly rarer excep
tions, has generally supported the
work of the constituted authoriti
es in charge of the physical wel
fare of Florida. Beyond the bor
ders of the State, the work
has been appreciated perhaps
even more than south of the St.
Marys River. The health officer
of a neighboring commonwealth
has been credited with the state
ment that Florida has the only
board of health worthy of the
name in all the Southern States.
Its accomplishments in closing
and keeping closed the doors of
one of the principal entrances in
to the United Slates against epi
demic diseases from the Islands of
the Southern seas, has been extoll
ed by health authorities of the na
tion. Never has this Board advocated
the use of methods of eradication
or prevention of disease which
have not been fully proven to be
correct and received the stamp of
approval of the highest scientific
authorities of the world. It has
kept in closest touch with the de
velopcments of medical -science,
believing that the people of Flori
da whose health interests have
bcen.committed to it as a most sol
emn responsibility, are entitled to
the benefits of the best things that
the scientific world has to give,
Never has it "experimented"
with unproven theories. Not un
til it had been demonstrated that
the yellow fever germ is carried
by the mosquito, did it advocate
and practice methods in accord
ance with that demonstration. By
the use cf those methods it has
stamped out in its beginning more
than one menacing epidemic, and
sometimes in the face of the most
violent opposition and threats of
personal violence to the Board's
Executive Officer.
Never until the anti-typhoid
vaccine had been confirmed as an
efficient preventative of the dis
ease, did this Board urge its use in
this State, and then it spread
broadcast the knowledge by every
means in its power, that lives
might be saved and the disease
checked or banished.
Not until it had been positively
established in the minds of medi
cal authorieies all over the world
that malaria is a parasitic disease,
that this parasite is carried by a
certain mosquito; that even in
Rome.amongthe swamps that bor,
der the Tibcr,a healthy man sleep
ing behind and under efficient
screening, even breathing the mi
asmatic air of that home of malar
ia, might yet be free from the dis
ease, did the Board preach ,the
gospel of screens as'the sure pre
ventative in Florida. '
Florida '8 Health Board and
Florida's Health Officer have be
lieved, and have acted upon the
belief, that the more a man comes
to an understanding of and obedi
enco to the laws of nature, which
are the laws of God, the more in-1
timately will he come into con- j
formity with the divine plan,!
which is to work out man s salva
tion, physically and spiritually.
The Board and its Execu
tive Officer have a reason for the
faith that is in them. This reason tthe special fund for indebtedness
they are always willing to give ,ami erai funds to the fine and
and neither the Board nor its Ex-forfciture fund( wa8 received and

are offensive in presenting their) Tho hour having arrived, bids

man to make mistakes; that the
sum of all human wisdom is tke
combined wisdom of all men.
Therefore, it asks and welcomes
such criticisms and suggestions
from' any source as add to ' its
knowledge of health matters. It
does not invite the fault-finding
which on its face shows its birth
in. prejudice and ignorance; and;
the Board deplores the sniffling,
self-opinionated egotism which
ridicules established facts of prov
en scientific accomplishment.
All it asks is that its critics play
the game fair, like real sportsmen,
like honorable men, and that they
discuss honestly points of differ

Mr. Catts is a Baptist minister,
having served churches in Ala
bama and in Florida. He is a man
of ability and of strong convic
tions and is welWeputed among
his Baptist brethren in his native
state, and in the state of his adop
tion. Ave have known him for
more than twenty-five years. If he
is seated as governor of Florida,
he will do no foolish things as
some seem to fear. No doubt he
will be a terror to evil doers and
aw breakers. He will do his duty
fairly and fearlessly, if he acts as
governor as he has always acted
as a minister and a citizen. Fla.

Novel Taxation Method
Sydney, in New South Wales.
has adopted a method of taxation
which is at least unusual.
Hereafter Sydney, with a popu
lation of 700,000, will raise almost
all of its entire revenue from a
tax on the land.
There is no personal property
tax, and the system was adopted
on the assumption that the value
of a city lot is due, not to the en
terprise and industry of the own
er, but to the mere presence of
population.
An acre of farm land may be
worth $1.50. Build a city around
it and the acre may be worth a
million dolars.
Sydney says: "We ereated these
big values for land and we are go
ing to tax them to pay the expens
es of thia government. The build
ings on the lands were erected by
the owners. We want more build
ings, so we won't tax the owners
for building them so long as we
can get the necessary revenue
from the land values."
The principle of encouraging
improvements by exemption from
taxation is making progress all
over the world.
Sydney's move alone that line
is the most radical as vet noted.
and the outcome will doubtless at
tract very general attention.

rendered the standard into the
hands of one-not entitled to bear

price."
The course I am now pursuing
would tend to prevent, rather
than to provoke a division in the
Democratic party. The present
conditions indicate much division,
whereas a correction of errors
and a fair and honest adjustment
of irregularities would satisfy the
present unsettled public mind,
and tend to consolidate and har
monize present divisions. Any
investigation or knowledge of my
official record or acquaintance
with my personal character would
satisfy any fair-minded person
that I do not want anything that
belongs to another man.
Realizing that in the conduct
of elections many errors may oc
cur and this is especially true
when an untried law such as our
"second-choice primary" law is
used for the first time on a state
wide ticket the lawmakers of
the state have wisely provided for
appropriate actions to be institut

ed in the courts to determine in
'cases of doubt who may be the
nominee or official rightfully chos
'en. The power of determining
such matters has been left to the
courts, for there we find the pro
tection'of all our rights, and fr
the additional reason that our
courts are less likely to be influ
enced by partisan considerations
than bodies more political in their
nature. A court that would per
vert its power to veto the will of
the people as lawfully expressed
in an election would be guilt'" of a
grave moral crime; a court in de
termining, according to law and
justice, the real result of an elec
tion, is performing its highest and
most patriotic service to the state.
In 1908, when Congressman
Mayes was denied a certificate of
nomination by the executive com
mittee which, under the former
law, canvassed the returns the
Supreme Court corrected the er
ror, and Mr. Kehoe, to whom the
certificate had been given through
the committee's crrors.immediate
ly withdrew his name from the
ballot and. thus the choice of the
district was upheld. Mr. Kehoe
himself ; was nominated tor con

returning board, which sought to
steal the governorship, and which

votes for the presidential electors,

ageous and rightous action ofthe
Supreme Court the people might
not have regained control of their
state from carpetbaggers and ne

have done nothing had it not been
for the powers given them by the
Constitution and the laws. In ap

Conditions are happily different

Canvassing Board is honorable
and upright.but having no discre
tionary powers,, it was compelled
by law to authorize a certificate to

of the legal and equitable ques

I have the utmost confidence in
our judiciary, and whether the
courts decide for me or against

done their duty fairly and con

verdict, if unfavorable, with the
same cheerful acquiescence

ADVANTAGE IN
LAMAISONETTE HILL
CAN SEE ALL THAT GOES ON
IN PER0NNE A PRI
MARY OBJECT
Germans Heavily Shelling the Allies
Russians Continue to Advance
Toward KovelThe British
Have Gained Ground
London With the capture by
the French of La Maisonette hill,
which dominates the valley of the
Somme and from which every
thing that happens in Pcronno
can be observed, one of the pri
mary objects of the Anglo-French
offensive has been achieved.
The two armies are now engag
ed in an effort to organize and ex
tend tho limits of the ground
they have gained and in repell
ing the German counter attacks
which are directed particularly a
gainst the British to the north of
the river, where they succeeded
in regaining a footing in the
Trones wood. At other points,
however, the British have been
able to make some progress, al
though necessarily slow, against
well fortified positions.
The Germans are heavily shell
ing the allies' front from Lens to
the Belgian coast but thus far
there have been no attempts at in
fantry action except for the usual
raids in which both sides engage.
The Russians continue their ad
vance toward Covel and are now
engaged in a pitched battle alonr
the banks of the Stokhod which
they have crossed at some points.
On the rest of the eastern front
while there is- continuous fighting
at many places, no important
change occurred. Both sides are
concentrating their efforts on the
Lutsk Balient to the east of Kovel.
In the Caucasus and Mesopo
tamia the fighting between the
Turks and the Russians continues
with varying results. The weath
er in the greater part of this reg
ion which is extremely hot, pre-
J eludes any sustained efforts.
After the assault of Monday
night the. British remain in pos
session of Contalmaison, holding
it against German countcr-at-tacka
and furious shell fire.
Fighting continued through the
night from Ovilliers and to Bois
selle and to Trones wood. The
British gained considerably in the.
Mameitz wood and took all ex
cept the point most furiously dis
puted, pear-shaped. Tho taking
of Trones wood! clears the way to
the next line of German defenses.
The artillery is so close that guns
on either side are not firing on tho
first lino for fear of hitting their
own men. Overhead shells are
screaming past in to the reserves
to keep assistance from those in
front.
More Tales of Bandit Activities
Brought to the Border
El Paso, Texas Mexican auth
orities in Chihuahua City believe
Villa is helping if not actually
leading the bandits in their depre
dations in Chihuahua, according
to those in close touch with Mexi
can affairs, who reached Ameri
can soil Tuesday. One of them said
General Trevino, in command of
the tfo facto troops, has received
word that before the Jiminez at
tack, bandits captured and sacked
a town several miles to the north -and
cut off the ears of their cap
tives.
Substantiating their storv of
the branding of prisoners was tho
story of a Mexican soldier who re
ported to General Gonzalez, upon
his arrival in Juarez, that his ears
had been cropped after his cap
ture in Jiminez. This arrival
said the anti-American feeling in
Chihuahua City had disappeared.
ihose from the Casas Grandes
district say the arrival of the
rainy season has been a treat
boon to the American soldiers of
the Pershing command, some of
whom had begun to sicken with
the continued dust storms which
had prevailed for several weeks.
He added that natives in that dis
trict cling firmly to the belief that
Villa is dead.
