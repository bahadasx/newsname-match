DIED BY THE ROADSIDE
Tuesday evening as Mr. Moore,
Round ' House Foreman for the
Santa Fe, was returnicg from an
auto ride on the Canyon road and
bad reached a point about li miles
above the Cataract bridge No. 2, he
noticed green flies quite busy about
the body of a man lying near the
road under a cedar tree. On the
road out, Mr. Moore noticed the
body but supposed it tq be of a
man asleep. Inspection showed"
Mr. Moore that J the body was of a
dead man in a rather advanced
stage of decomposition. He report
ed the matter to Town Marshal
Bobby Burns who notified Coroner
F. O. Twitty. The Coroner im
paneled a jury and took them to
the body and viewed it officially,
the body was then brot into town
by J S. Button who took it to his
undertaking parlorj. Wednesday
at 1 p m. the coroners jury met in
Judge Twitty'g office to hear evi
dence and report the finding.
The Jury's 1 Report
After listening to whatever evi
dence could be found bearing on
the case the Jury reported that the
deceased, T. A. Turner, came to his
death thru causes unknown. It
developed that T. A. Turner had
been in the vicinity of WillUois
for several months camping in var
ious places. His camp at the time
of his death was near: the cinder
pit..' It was thot that hie- may: have
been a proppector, ' since he bad
been in correspondence with a firm
of assay ers and had received a je
mittancetor a email amount of ore.
It was not thot by anyone that
Turner had met with foul play.' It
seemed more probable that he may
. have ..been the victim of ptomaine
poison' ' He had evidently died in
in great pain, the earth being dis
turbed by his convulsions.
A number of automobiles had
passtd along the Canyon , road
6ince Turner's 'death, which prob
ably took place Monday, but all
thot as did Mr. Moore when he
first-saw the body, that it. was. a
man asleep. ! v,

"LOCAL TALENT PICTURE
Grand Canyon, July 13-' 16 In
addition to the regular motion pic
ture show at the Kolb Studio,
which on Saturday, July 1st, was
Mary Pickford in "The Found
ling," was shown some of our own
local talent in a little play and
there was nothing amateurish
about the performance either. The
picture was taken last year by
Burton Holmes, the writer and lect
urer of national fame, and showed
the start and finish of a forest fire,
a very timely subject ' in Northern
Arizona.
Careless campers after their out
door meal, left a smouldering fire
which quickly spread into a thing
of danger. From his high watch
tower the Supai Indian guard saw
the smoke, sent in the signal, and,
mounting his pony, raced to the
fire. Mr. Way, our forest ranger,
received the signal and, accompan
ied by Mrs. Way, rode to the fire
on spirited horses who stopped not
for fences or high sage brush. The
little pack burro who also played
the hero and went to the fire, posed
artlessly before the motion picture
machine, 'but no more splendidly
than the fire fighters.
Spellmires Are Settled in Will
iams The family of G. H. Spellmire
of Babbitt-Poison arrived in Will

the trip by Santa Pe.
. In settling ' in Williams the
Spellmires '"have added to the
population of course, but, more
important they have made a val
uable addition to Williams soci
ety. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Spell
mire there are two daughters,
Miss 1 Blanche' arid .Miss, Vivian
and a younger son, Master
"Bill' '. Probably young Bill has
other names that will , go in
Williams, all right. The Spell
mires will occupy , one of Pat
Rohan's houses on Railroad Ave.,

MORE SCHOOL ROOM
The addition to the Williams
school house which the school
board has contracted with Bau-
mann & Hinds, Williams con
ti actors, to build for $4,875, will
add three good sized class rooms
to the present capacity of the
building, besides a corridor 8' 8"
wide running the whole length
of the addition. The outside
dimensions ot tne addition are
34ft by 56ft. ,
In the -construction of the ad
dition the east front of the pres
ent building . will be duplicated.
The long corridors will be an ex
tension of the corridor in the
present building and will be
ready for a later addition on the
west which when built will com
piete :the, jbuilding and give a
south front duplicating the north
front above the basement.
.It is not thot by the school
board that the addition for which
they have contracted is more
than an emergency measure to
secure badly needed room. There
must be another building in the
near future. The funds for the
addition are partly in hand and
partly in- sight to be in hand.
however, in a few months. For
tunately, no taxes will have to
be levied for the construction.

GRAND CANYON ITEMS
The approved greeting these days
is: "Via it rain over at vour
ace?" .There have been rain?
but pitifully partial things. In
places water ran on the ground
while not turee miles away the
dusty roads were just sprinkled.
However, the intense heat and the
great cottony clouds promise rain
for the Whole country. .
The fortunate individuals who
went to the big 4th of July celebra
tion at Prescott, report a splendid
time and marvelous riding bv the :
cowboys who came from all over
the country. Apparenly Prescot was
not prepared for the crowd of 10,- .
000, f6r sleeping places were at a
premium. One of our old citizens
who brazeuly boasted that he had
engaged a bed away ahead of time,
at night found himself with no ,
place to lay his shaggy head. . He :
was forced to walk out into the
country where he was at last fold

report. : :; 1 :
