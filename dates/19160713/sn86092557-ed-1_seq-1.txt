MODI GARBAGE
DISPOSAL PLAN!
10 BE ERECTED
] City Today Closed Deal for
j the Necessary
! Land.
ADJOINS PRESENT PLANT
New Outfit Will Be Odor
less and an Improvement
to Landscape,
The first step toward securing a
modern ordorless garbage disposal
plant for Fairmont was taken today
when the city Board of Affairs pur
chased almost six acres of additional
land surrounding the present crema
tory from M. A. JollIfTe.
The transaction was conducted by
real estato agent W. A. Lawler and
the price paid was $550 per acre for
5.95 acres. The present property on
which the crematory Is located con
sists og .57 acres. This with the 5.95
acres surrounding which was purchas
ed today makes a total site of 6.42
acres which will be used for the lo
cation of the new ordorless incinera
tor which has been recommended by
the city health physician, Dr. Ches
ney M. Ramage.
The new garbage disposal plant
when completed will, be of the most
modem type and all manner of waste
and refuse will be handled in a sani
tary and scientific manner with the
least possible offensive odor. It is
planned to make the new plant one
of the most attractive spots near the
city and he able will be a beautiful
example of landscape gardening rath
er than an eyesore such as exists at
present.
The city officials have been working i
quietly for some time on this proposl- j
Hon which was first advocated earlier
in the spring by Dr. Ramage. The pres
ent crematory is adequate for the
needs of the city and the placo is
rapidly becoming an offensive nuisanc"
to every person who lives in that
neighborhood. For this reason it Is
likely, now that the site has been ac
quired, that immediate steps toward ,
the selection and installation of a mod
em plant similar to those described
in the West Virginian this spring,
will he tnken.

Col. Jadwin of the United Statos
Engineering department of Pitts
burgh, is in the city today looking ov
er the town. He is being taken about
by Mayor Anthony Bowen and Com
miseioner Ira Smith and being shown
the fine things of which Fairmont con

here during the night and went im
mediately to the pier where the Kit

In order to get to his boat he had
to walk a one-foot wide-10-foot-long
plank. He did not like this Job and
when he met the city fathers this
morning the first thing he said was
"You have a bum way of taking care
of a wharf, why don't you fix It up?"

AS PEACE FORCE
Rev. Leigh Layman Says
They May Prevent a
Great Race War.
Rev. Leigh Layman a missionary for
the past twonty years to Japan,"told
i in an Interesting manner to a large
audience of peoplo at the Temple last
night his views concerning the present
status of that country in its relations
with the United States.
Mr. Lawman believes that war with
Japan is a thing of the far distance
and may never culminato unless un
forseen difficulties arise. He spoke
of the great preparedness campaign
which Japan has carried on unceasing
ly for years past and stated that this
Is done in order that Japan might com
i bat successfully any Interference of
Russia to which she is now allied.
Mr. Layman redlcts three great is-!
sues after the European war is over.1
First, a commercial competition as to
who will supply China's wants, Arner- j
lea. England or Japan: Second, a re-j
llgloiiR war without bloodshed In which
he believes China will eventually
adopt her own form of religion and
Third, a racial war between the Ori
ent and the Occident He stated that
the one great force which could stay
these proceedings is the universal de
velopment of foreign missions.
Rev. Mr. Layman, wife and two i
daughters who are guests of the Miss
es Layman on Ogden avenue expect
to leave for Pittsburg the latter pari
of the week en route to points In Ohio
where they will spend some time be
fore sailing for Japan the latter part

CONTEND BOND
ELECTION NOTICE
WAS DEFECTIVE
Lincoln District Road Bond
Matter Being Argued
in Court
LAWYERS AT IT AIL DAY
Attorney Morris Says Sher
iff's Records Are In
Error.
j An attempt to have the Marion
ounty Court annul the result of the
j Lincoln district road bond election
I was being mad/ this afternoon by at
: torneys J. A. Meredith, R. A. Watts
l and E. G. Smith of Clarksburg, rep
j resenting the citizens of Lincoln dis
j trlct who still claim that the recent
bond election was illegal.
j Tusca Morris on behalf of the Lin
j coin district committee who are hup
I porting the bond issue argued that the
election was legal and filed an affidavit
of deputy Bhoriff Bambridge stating an
error In the date of his return had
been made and asking that the sher
iff be allowed to correct this.
At the morning session of the court,
Attorney Meredith first appeared and '
stated the grounds on which the In-1
junction was being asked. This \va3 i
that an orror had been made in the 1
postiug of the required notices by the
Bhoriff thiryt dnvs bfore the holding
of th election, and that the return of
the deputy on file in the sheriffs of
fice showed that these notices had out i
been posted at the various polling j
places throughout the district until the
28th day of March. Mr. Meredith
pointed out the fact that the election
had been held on April 26, thus only;
29 days had elapsed after the posting]
of the notices. He further contended |
that the law in regard to the publica
tion of the notice in the newspapers j
had ont been fully complied with.
A number of instances were cited by
Meredith where the courts had aa
judged such bond elections void and
invalid because of such discrepancies
in the notices of election and had ev
en after tho bonds had beon sold, en
joined the court from collecting taxes
to pay for the bonds. For this reason
he said taht he and Attorney E. G.'
Smith had thought it only fair to tho
members of the court to inform them
that the application for an injunction
which was filed yosterday with circuit
clerk W. S. Black would be taken
before circuit Judge Haymond Max
well at Clarksburg at onco uuleBs the
court would of themselves decide to
set aside the entire bond election pro
ceedings.
Attorney Tusca Morris was sent, for
, on behalf of the. Lincoln District com
mittee and after hearing the proposl
j tlon said that the return o fthe deputy
| sheriff was in error and that even
! then they were preparing an affadavit
to show that these notices had been
posted on March 27 and that the date
would be changed on the return to
show such to be the case. It was
then agreed to pass upon tho matter
at two o'clock this afternoon.

Authorities.
PROPERTY LOSS IK BIG BLAZE
Hentzy Family Lost Practically Everything They!
eluding Clothes When Their Home Was
Burned?No Insurance.
Fire Marshal Kindleberer, of
[ Wheeling, has been asked by the local
' fire department to come to Fairmont
and take charge of an investigation in
to tlie origin of the fire which last
evening destroyed the Fairmont Art |
Glass Factory on the East shore of the
river and the residence of the Hentzy j
family which adjoined the plant. It
I secmB clear that til blaze was of In
cendiar yorigin and there are many
rumors afloat today that the factory'
was burned down by a discharged em
ploye who was promted to do it by ,
enemies of the Hentzy family, who
own the plant. George Hentzy. mana
ger of the Art Glass company has ;
been requested to appear before the
Mayor and the Fire Chief and toll what
| he knows of threats which members
of the Hentzy family claim have been j
made against the factory.
i Should he bear out the statement!
i of the members of the family that a
I competitor had mado threats and had
! previously attempted to get within :
I striking distance of the factory war
| rants will be issued.
Bearing difectly upon the origin ot
the fire is the story told by the oldest
daughter of the family. Miss Anna
Lorraine Hentzy. She states that
John Johnson, a former employee, vis
ited the place last evening hut a few j
minutes before the fire and that he j
carried into the wareroom, where the
fire started two bundles of paper. This
man was seen but 30 minutes before
that time on Merchant surest wending
his way toward the factory by Police
Chief Fred Harr. The chief stopped
the man and asked him "Where you
going?" The man replied. "I'm going
to the country to eat a good meal."
The chief scenting whiskey on the
man's breath said "You better be care
ful and not drink too much whiskey."
i At this they parted.
In the wareroom of the factory
Johnson talked with the watchman of
I the plant for several minutes, after
which the watchman went into tue
Hentzy home to eat supper and John
son apparently went around the cor
ner. While still eating his supper the
shout of "fire" was heard by the
watchman. The plant waB then burn
ing rapidly. The chief saw the man
at About 5:45 in the ?vonlng and the
fire started at 6:25 p. in. Johnson can
not be found today.
The blaze was discovered by rail
road men on the west side of the riv-!
or, opposite the factory at about 6:?0
o'clock. They blew the whistle of an
engine repeatedly to attract the at
tention of a little parly o? ?irl* who
were bathing in the river right out
from the glass plant, but their repeat
ed pointing and other pantonine fail
ed to suggest anything to the bathers.
The whistle, however, did cause Mrs.
Frank Hentzy. widow of the founder
of the Art Glass company and mother
of the Hentzy children to go to the
river to. see if everything was well
with the bathers, among whom was
her daughter Anna Lorraine. In doing
this she passed directly by the ware
room where the fire was blazing at the
time but failed to note that fact.
Standing on the shore a moment or
two. the mother started back to the
house and as soon as she had faced
toward her home discovered the
(lames. She gave an alarm and ran
In the house in an effort to save
something. She was soon accompa
nied by her daughters who fought for
three hours trying to get a few valu
ables and some clothes out of .the
flames. Their concerted efforts were
unavailing except to the extent that
a few valuable chair and tables and
knicknacks were placed in the lawn
where they are today. Miss Anna
Hentzy who was bathing saved naught
but her bathing suit. She attempted
once to save some clothing and in so
doing placed her life in jeopardy.
While the flames were at their
height Miss Hentzy ran up a flight of
stairs and into her room whore she in
some manner unknown even to herself,
so she says this morning, lifted a
heavy trunk through to the upstairs
door to the roof of the kitchen and
from the roof she jumped to the
ground. A small boy nearby got to
the roof and shoved the ti'unk over tho
edge. Her hard work was badly com
pensated for the trunk did not con
tain her clothing. In the meantime
the East Side flre department and the
car of Assistant Chief Ralph Doolittle
from this side reachod the scene, both '
at the same time. It was discovered
that to reaoh the flamts with a stream
of water a line 700 feet long would
have to be stretched from B street and
East Park and another hose 900 feei
from the corner of Water street and
Merchant. This was done as quickly
as possible and both pressures played?
on the fire.
In giving as a reason why the Art
burned regardless of the water on|f&i
the firemen said this morninfV.
Just one of those fires that wat?~
would not affect." This about covoj
ed It. for Uie factory was construe)

There was no insurance on either'tl _
