About the waterfront there has been

the bones of a whale but -there still

A representative of the Bishop Mu

Inches in length and at the big end
it is 8 inches In diameter and at least
30 inches around.
Today other bones were found.
These were parta of the jaw, half of
the' mandible and half of the maxil

based ; his assumption that all of the
bones were those of a whale. And
