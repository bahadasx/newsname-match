Mr. Smith furtner stated that the ar

was intimated that the elusive "man

civilian holding a high office in the
department, would be implicatci.
The twelve men referred to by the
Asaistant District Attorney were until
a few months apo memher- of the staff
of an inspector who was transferred by
(ommissioner Woods. At that time,
the (ommissioner -aid, the mspector
had been overworked and hud bren

would permit of more re^t. None of

Baltimore, July 11 The waterline of
the submarine merchantman Deutsch?

guards the steady, rapid process of un

tain Koenig himself speeded the work!
of the negro stevedores this morning. |
The return cargo of nicke! and rubber, |
already stored in the warehouse at the

be transferred to the submarine in less
than two days.
Government offlcrals would not he j

Bremen soon after to-morrow's visit of j

Big Check to Red Croaa.
Tha Deutschland's crew is not only J
brave, as the submarine's exploit
proves. These men are a big-hearted
lot. They decided to-night to turn '
over the $10,000 check donated by Au

The er.tire crew will be taken to '

to them. Scores of entertainments

up to this time the men have been

plans for to-morrow's trip to Washing?

go ,n a body and return to their ship

Captain Koenig was amused when he

SAYS U-BOAT GOT
SUPPLIES ON TRIP
Copenhagen, via London.
July .12.?Captain Persius,
the naval expert. writing in
the "Berliner Tageblatt" on
the voyage of the Ger?
man commerce submarine
Deutschland to America, says
it may be assumed the r.ub
marine received supplies
"from depots on the way."
He adds that the exploit
of the Deutschland is neither
so difficult nor so dangerous
as that of the German sub?
marine which went to Con
stantinople.
Mibmarine's sailing might be regarded
as information of military value to the
enemies of Germany.
(aptain Koenig said: "I shall clear
and announce my departure like any ,
other merchantman. Then I will go." i
(aptain koenig Inruffled.
Captain Koenig will have to take ojt
his clearance papers like any other j
trading vessel. The Deutschland may
lay in Baltimore Harbor, however, or in
aay part of the CheaapeBke Ray until a
propitious time for the dash is at hand.
The ship's olf.cers and her local agent.i
. rcalize that it will be impossibie for
j her to travel all the way down the
Chesapeake Bay without being aeen.
but if (aptain Koenig is worried he is (
not showing it at all. I

Two hoys swimming in Matawan
Creek yesterday, more than a mila
from where it empties i,ito Raritan
Bay, wore attacked by a shark. Ore
is dead; the other, if he lives, will
have hut one leg. A man diving to
recover the boy's body had most of
one leg torn off by the shark, and
died after reaching shore. There was
a report in Matawan that a man
named Baldwin was attacked ani
killed by the shark at Keyport at the
mouth of the creek.
Lester Stillwell was the first vic
tirrr. He was twelve years old, tho
son of Filliam Stillwell, of Matawan.
His body has nd been recovep-d.
Joseph Dunn, fourteen years old, of
124 East 128th Street, was the oe***.
or.d to be attacked. He is in St.
Peter's Hospital. N'ew Brunswirk,
and may live. W. Star.Iey Fisher,
twenty-five years old, of Matav
with Stillwell's body in his
fought the shark br several minutei,
sucoeeded in reaching shore alone,
and died from his injuries.
Flsh Patrols Near City.
Assuming that one roaming man
eater is responsible for the dcaths
of the last ten days, the shark has
patrolled the coast on both sides af
N'ew York, travelling at least sev
enty-five miles fron one end of his
beat to the other. He was first
heard of near Spring Lake. Within
a day or two the death of Charles
Bruder, a few miles north of Spring
Lake, .-howed his progress. Next
he was at Bridgehampton, Ixmg
Island, a good seventy-rive miles in
a coasting line from Spring Lake.
His appffarance at Matawan
would tend to show that he had
skirted all of the Lower Bay and
at some time- within a day or two
must have been off Coney Island
and the Rockaway.-,. He was as
near them as he was to Raritan
Creek when he swam into the Lower
Bay.

Matawan Creek at Matawan Is a
sluggish tidewater stream that
meandcrs through the lowlands. It
is about rifty feet wide and from
eight to fifteen feet deep.
At. Wyck.iff's dock, a pier which
juts out into the creek some twenty
feet, the stream bends sharply. It ia
wide at the bend, and Wyckoff's dock
is t\\o village swimming hole. It is
about one hundred yards from the
street.

bert O'Hara, 'harles Van Brunt, Andrew
Bublin, Henry Schencke and Letter
Stillwell, nop.e of them more than four?
teen years old, went down to WyckofT's
dock. Lester had spent all the morning
working for a bask.'tmaker. He had
earned Tl cents, and on the way to
the dock he bought a bathing suit on
which he had long had hu eye.
Shouting. leaping and splashing, tha
crowd kept the swimming hole in an
uproar for half an hour.
Boy Yictitn's laat Dive.
"Come on, fellows!" shouted l.estsr,
poising a' the end of the pier, "ona
dive apiece and we'll go home."
Waiting until his companions had
leaped, I.,stcr gave a spring and dis
appeared.
Just as the splash behind him told
of Lester's dive Wiliiam Hyer, who
was almost wi'hin reach of the greatn
lilmed ladder that give* access to ths
pier from th<? water, felt a sharp blow
upon his icft leg. He glanced down
and kicked himself through the last
few feat of water in a frenry of
fright.
