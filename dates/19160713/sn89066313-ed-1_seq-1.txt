r tin- British olfensivc is uppioacli-iii-
a oris-is in the battle northeast of
Albert, where P.iitlsh troops are striv
ing In advance east waul to Martin-
putli.
The Hermans hate thrown several
arm -oin into action on both sides
of the Albert-Baupaume road to de
fend the approaches to that city. They
are making savage counter attacks,
particularly southeast of Contalmai
miii, where a Herman success would
hold up the whole Ilritish advance.
Herman correspondents, admitting
the great power of the British offen
sive, claimed that the attacking forces
hae suffered heavy losses, comparable
only to the casualties at Verdun.
ltritish correspondents report that
the Knslish losses have been severe
niih in the death grapples for posses
sion of villages where CScrman ma
chine guns have played on the Ilritish
legions.
On the eastern front the operations
east of Kovel have reached a tempor
art lull, with the Russians and Aus-trn-Hermans
redistributing their
force and opening up artillery fire
along the Stanched River, where there
i- a renewal of the heavy fighting.

Greatest Good to the Greatest
Number the Test, Speak
er Believes.
"The hope for democracy lies in
America," said Jonas Viles, professor
of history, in his assembly lecture
this morning on "The Testing of
American Democracy." The real test
of our democracy lies in the ability
of the American people to conserve
the best of past ideals in building up
a new democracy to meet the pres
ent conditions."
The old democracy of individualism
must give place to the new democra
cy of social service, according to Pro
fessor Viles. "There are many evi
dences both of success and failure in
this new adjustment. If we throw
away our time on futile efforts we
can never hope to accomplish any
thing. Americans love new things
and turn enthusiastically to novel
remedies. The great danger is In
sending our efforts toward particular
reforms and leaving the greater ones
alone.
"Our government today is dealing
with many complex problems. What
we need is an effective control by
public opinion. Our government is
one of parties. Results must come
through party organization. Party
ideals are changing, and' this is a
good sign. Two other signs of the
time which are significant are the de
mand of the people for intelligent
leaders and the remarkable growth of
intelligent voting."
Professor Viles finds two princi
ples for use which are on trial now
in the European war. These are na
tionality and democracy. He thinks
that Europe is now recognizing that
individual democracy is insufficient.
The subordination of the individual is
necessary. Also, the smaller nation
alities must yield to the greatest
good of the greatest number.

Democracy in America began with the
frontier. The first ideals were west
ern. Every man had a chance to get
ahead. The successful man was the
one who did most things reasonably
well. .Vow these conditions have
changed and must finally disappear.
"This does not mean that we are
doomed, but it does mean that we
must get new ideals founded upon the
old."
"Hot as July" means something to the
average Columbian today. At 2:30 o'
clock the thermometer registered 98
degrees, which is the maximum tem
perature so far this year. Columbia
has had more hot days this month
than all last year, since there were
only eight days in 3915 that showed
a temperature above 90 degrees.
The hottest day last year was July
3, when the thermometer reached 93
degrees. The hottest day on record
for Columbia was also in July July
12, 1901, with a thermometer at 111 de
grees. "So far this has not been an unus
ual month in regard to the heat," says
Reorge Reeder, director of the local
weather bureau. "It is too early in
the month to make a definite state
ment." This dry-warm area covers Missouri
and the middle states. There has
been only one rain to wet the ground
since June 6. It has. however, been
comparatively cool and the dryness
was not felt until last week.
Indications point to the possibility
of a local thunder shower, which may
afford temporary relief. However, 'r.
Reeder thinks it hardly seems prova
ble that any relief will come before
Saturday or Sunday.

El. PASO, July 12. Information re
ceived here that the Carranzista Hen
eral Trevino furnished Villa with mu
nitions was proved probable today.
Trevino reported an attack by his men
on the bandits operating in the Parral
district.
Telegraphic communication was cut
by Villistas south of Chihuahua last
night. The break is believed to be in
the vicinity of Santa Rosalia and north
of the pont where the main body of
Villistas are operating.
Carranzista agents have furnished
United States officials here with de
tailed charges of a plot by Trevino to
assist the rebel movement in northern
.Mexico, with the ultimate purpose ot
replacing Villa at the head. A report
ed attack on American troops by Tre
vino's order is said to have caused
Obregon's order replacing Trevino by
Enriquez.
