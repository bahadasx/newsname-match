GERMAN SUBMARINE
LANDS AT BALTIMORE.!
Makes Trip With Valuable Cargo In Six
teen Days.
The German merchant supersubmar-
ine Deutschland has arrived in Chesa
peake Bay.
Long expected, ridiculed, fabulous as
the sea serpent or the Flying Dutch
man, she became a realty to the wach-
ersoff Cape Henry at exactly 1;20
oclock Sunday morning, and soon after
was slowly making her way through a
network of Inquisitive ships and thru
the mazes of red tape of the quarantine
and customs officials toward her dock
at the pier of the Eastern Forwarding
Company, Locust Point, Baltimore,
where she arrived Monday.
The Deutschland made the trip in
sixteen eays. She is the largest sub
marine afloat. The largest German
war models are less than 300 feet long.
Due this submarine ot commerce Is 315
feet feet long, exactly one third the
length of the largest merchant vessels
afloat the Vaterland and the Impcra-
tor.
The boat carried no passengers. Her
cargo consists of dyestull a hundred
tons of them, and many tons of mail.
This keeps her very low In the water
when riding on the surface. Her draft
when she was sighted was 17 feet and
It was largely because of her depth that
she did not try to come to land when
submerged.
