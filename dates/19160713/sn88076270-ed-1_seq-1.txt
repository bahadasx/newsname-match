GAINS MADE MONDAY NIGHT
GIVE FRENCH SOMME REGION
AND OVERLOOK PARONNE
London, July 11.—The British cap
tured Contalmaison on the French
front last night, the war office an
nounced today. Several lines of
trenches in the Mamatz wood were
also taken by the British. Heavy
fighting continues in the Trones wood.
With the capture by the French of
the Lamasonette hill which domin
ates the valley of the Somme and
from which everything that happens
in Peronne can be observed, one of
the primary objects of
Anglo-French
offensive has been achieved. The two
armies are now engaged in an effort
to organize and extend the limits of
the ground they have gained and in
repelling the German counter-attacks
which are directed particularly
against the British to the North of
the river where they succeeded in re
gaining a footing in the Trones wood.
Germans Shell Front
Germans on their part are heavily
shelling the allied front from Lens to
the Belgian coast but have made no
attempts at infantry action except the
usual raids in which both sides en

The Russians continue to advance
toward Kovel and are now engaged in
a pitched battle at the Strokhod
where they have crossed at some
points.
Prisoners Taken
Paris, July 11.—Situation remained
unchanged on the Somme front last
night.
The war office statement today says

days have taken more than 1,300 pris
oners.
Attack Near Verdun
On the Verdun front the Germans
launched an attack at 4 o'clock this
morning on the French positions from
Fleury to a point east of Chenois.
They succeeded in penetrating the ad
vanced French trenches at some
Ey
oints but were expelled immediately
a counter attack.
West of the Meuse there is active
artillery fighting in the neighborhood
of Avocourt, and Chattancourt.
Northwest of Veho, the Germans
have exploded four mines, the craters
of which were eventually occupied by
the French.

Preparations for the departure of the
First North Dakota Infantry, United
States Volunteers, are progressing
rapidly, the first batallion having
already begun striking tents, and
making final preparations to entrain
for the south.

Grafton has been appointed as secured
lieutenant of Company M, to fill the
office vacated by Harley Hanson, who
failed to pass the strict medical ex

or San Diego, Calif.
GLENDIVE MAN HURT IN
GAME LAST SUNDAY
In the game at Bruegger Park last
Sunday, Fred Chicken, Glendive's pop
ular 3rd baseman had the misfor
tune to wrench an ankle in such a
manner that one of the bonest were
broken just above the ankle joint. The
accident occurred when Chicken was
working at 1st.
A physician was summoned and the
injured man was removed to a hos
pital and the fracture reduced and
this week the young man was taken
to his home at Staaiey.
State Historical Sac 1
Wiliiston Man Will
Not Recover Reason
Hopelessly ill mentally, W. F. Ben
ton, former trainmaster on the Wil
iiston division of the Great Northern
railroad, whose skull was fractured
when he was struck by a snow plow
was taken to the hospital for the in
sane at Fergus Falls. The case of
Mr. Benton who has been an inmate
of St. Joseph's hospital in St. Paul,
is a remarkable one.
The trainmaster was injured on the
Berthold branch in February. He was
brought to St. Paul and for eleven
days he lay unconscious in the hos
pital. Then he began to improve and
five weeks after the accident it was
thought that he was on the road to
recovery. His physicians, Dr. J. A.
Guinn and Dr. Arthur Sweeney, tried
to effect a cure by trepanning, but
thought he was saved from paralysis,
a full cure was not effected. When his
condition was at its best Mr. Benton
tried to talk but was never able to
construct a logical sentence. Degen
eration of the brain tissues set in and
Mr. Benton was kept alive by the use
of drugs. Now, thought he is fairly
strong physically, his physicians have
given up all hope of the return of his
reason.
WIND STORM AT ARNEGARD
Last Thursday evening while the
Tom Steece show was in progress
Arnegard was struck by one of the
worst storms ever experienced in
this vicinity. The show, which was
playing in a tent, was about half
over when the storm struck and but
for the vigilence of the attendants,
many of the local theatre-goers may
have been seriously hurt as the
last of the spectators had just 'got
ten out when the big tent collapsed
and fell to the ground with a crash.
The storm, which lasted about half
an hour, was a mixture of wind, hail
and rain of terrific velocity but out
side of the above no serious damage
has been reported.—Call.
MAY KEEP DEPARTURE SECRET
Washington, July 12.—If news of
the departure of the German under
water liner Deutschland can be re

American Property Raided
El Paso, July 12.—Two battalions
of the Pennsylvania infantry, one of
the Second regiment and one of the
Tenth, broke camp here today and
prepared to entrain for Marathon,
Texas.
It was announced at military head
quarters that the state troops had
been ordered to reinforce the border
in the Big Bend district. The
orders followed closely the reports
i'"om the district that Mexican ban
dits had raided the Lamula mine, an
American property, 100 miles south
of the border, and that the residents
along the frontier near Bequillas,
Texas, feared that the outlaws were
moving north.
The Mexican authorities in Juarez
said today they were without any in
formation concerning the band, but
assumed that if reports of the raid
ing were correct, it was done by one
of the detachments of Villistas which
scattered following the recent attack
of Jiminez.

ALL READY FOR PICNIC
Tomorrow is the day on which
everyone goes to the big picnic at the
Experiment station. Plans have been
made to entertain 5,000 people and
no doubt an immense throng will take
part in the event.
message from Emperor William to
President Wilson, running the gaun
let of innumerable dangers from
mines, sea sweepers and enemy war
ships, and bringing a cargo of dye
stuffs, chemicals and mail the Ger
man undersea merchantman, the
Deutschland, quietly slipped into
Shesapeake bay at 1:45 a. m. yester
day.
It was the completion of a 4,000
mile sea voyage, the longest and most
hazardous ever attempted by any sub
marine.
Three hours later, led by the tug
Thomas F. Timmins, the great sub
mersible began the last ieg of its
voyage up the Chesapeake bay for
Baltimore.
The information that the Deutsch
land brought in a message from Em
peror William to President Wilson
was given out by Pilot Cocke, who
said he was told of this by Captain
Kairig, the submarine commander.
Flies Ensign of Merchant Vessel
The Deutschland carries, mounted
in its conning tower, two small guns,
of about three-inch calibre. No tor
pedo tubes are visible. It is capable
of submerging less than two minutes.
On the surface of the water the sub
mersible has speed of from 2 to 3
knots an hour more than the average
merchant steamer.
According to Captain Frederick
Cocke, a Norfolk pilot and the first
American to board the Deutschland,
the crew wore regulation uniforms of
German merchantmen seamen.
No flag was displayed when the
Deutschland first appeared off the
capes. Later, when inside the bay,
the German merchantman ensign was
raised.
Reaching the vicinity of the Vir
ginia coast Saturday morning, the
Deutschland remained far outside,
knowing that the capes were guarded
by enemy warships, and came in that
night under cover of darkness.
Passes Under Nose of French Cruiser
Captain Cocke declared at one time
he was within 500 yards of a French
cruiser outside the capes, but passed
in unobserved.
According to reports brought into
Norfolk and credited to members of
the Deutschland's crew, the submer
sible arrived off the capes late Thurs
day afternoon, but was detected by
the English and French cruisers on
guard, and was forced to run, the
chase lasting until Saturday morn
ing before the warships gave up the
hopeless task and returned to their
stations.
Voyage Across Atlantic Took Only
Sixteen Days
Baltimore, Md., July 10.—The
world's first submarine merchantman,
the German underwater liner Deutsch
land, anchored below Baltimore last
night.
She carries mail and a cargo of ton.!
of costly chemicals and dyestuffs and
is to carry back home a similar
amount of nickel and crude rubber
sorely needed by the German army.
Passed in on Surface
Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine reached
safety between the Virginia capes at
1:45 o'clock yesterday morning pass
ing in on the surface covered by a
heavy pall of darkness which settled
over the entrance of the bay with the
setting of a tell-tale half moon.
Once inside, the visitor threw cau
tion aside and began shrieking his
siren, signalling a pilot and at the
had been waiting in the lower bay
for nearly two weeks to greet the
Deutschland and convoy her into
port.
Flies Merchant Flag
Three hours later, at 4:45 o'clock
yesterday morning, the big submarine
started up the bay under her own pow
er with the German merchant flae fly
ing. It was piloted by Captain Fred
erick D. Cocke of the Virginia Pilots'
association and -convoyed by the Tim
mons.
She was making more than 12 knots
an hour and could have docked in Bal
timore last night, but arrangements
had been made for receiving her with
formal ceremonies today and her cap
tain was ordered to wait in the lower
harbor. He and his crew of 29 men
remained aboard their craft.
Regarding his vessel as a merchant
man subject to no unusual restric
tions, the skipper, whose name is said
to be Captain Kairig, went up to
Chesopeake without waiting to no
tify local customs and quarantine au
thorities of his presence. He was five
hours away before Norman Hamilton,

At last reports last night the cut
ter had not approached the submarine
and it is understood that she merely
was ordered to keep the strange craft
under surveillance as a neutrality
precaution. Quarantine and port reg
ulations will be complied with when
the vessel moves up to her dock to
day.
Few Details of Voyage
Little was known here about what
happened during the epoch-making
cruise across the ocean, which in a
small measure at least breaks the
blockade on German trade with the
rest of the world. None of the sub
marine's crew had landed and the
agents of her owners had received
only meager reports.
Such information as was available
came indirectly from the pilot and
from Captain Hans F. Hinsch of the
North German Lloyd liner Neckar,
laid up here since the beginning of
the war. Captain Hinsch boarded the
Deutschland from the Timmons and
made the trip up the bay with her.
Stands High Out of Water
According to the accounts reaching
here, the under water liner's super
structive was standing 15 feet above
the water when she came in.
The boat is consigned to A. Schu
macher & Co., local agents of the
North German Lloyd Tine and her
cargo to the Eastern Forwarding com
pany, a concern said to have been
organized within the past few weeks,
especiall yto handle the business of
underwater liners. The latter com
pany has a pier and warehouse in
which are stored the goods to be load
ed on the Deutschland for her return
trip.
In German quarters here the news
of the submarine's arrival was hailed
with the keenest delight. Those who
knew of her coming, had been con
cealing alarm for two or three days
•9 she was due to arrive about the
middle'of last week. It is understood
that she traveled more than 4,000
miles, going some 800 miles out of
her course to avoid enemy ships.
The Deutschland is no converted
war craft, but a brand new commerce
carrier owned in Bremen and sent
here on a purely commercial mission,
according to Henry G. Hilken, the
senior member of the Schumacher
concern. She belongs to the Ozean
Rhederei, Limited (Ocean Navigation
company, Limited) and was launched
at Kiel in March.
Propelled by Deisel Engines
The novel project was conceived
about nine months ago, Mr. Hilken
said, by F. A. Lohmann, head of a
Bremen exporting and importing con
cern who organized the Ocean Navi
gation company. Mr. Lohmann is the
son of a former director general of
the North German Lloyd Steamship
company and has the important Ger
man commercial interests associated
with him.
The undersea liner, Mr. Hilken
says, is about 310 feet long and 30
feet bean and is propelled by_ two
great Deisel oil engines. She is as
large if not larger than any of the
German naval submarines and car
ries 750 tons weight of cargo. As to
details of her construction Hilken
said he was lacking in information.
Leak Somewhere
"Most of the information that was
sent to me,'' he said, "is probably
carefully tucked away in a pigeonhole
of the British admiralty office but I
don't care now. The Deutschland is
here nevertheless."
Mr. Hilken is an American and his
firm has been in business operating
ships under the American flag since
1824. Carl A. Luederitz, the Ger
man consul, is a member of the firm.
To whom the Deutschland's car^o
is consigned Mr. Hilken said he did
not know but he believed it was go
ing to a number of concerns badly in
need of dyestuffs.

This project was conceived." he
said, "by German commercial inter
ests who wanted to reopen trade with
the United States. We needed some
of German's commodities and Ger
many needs some of ours. It is a pure
ly commercial proposition and that is
all there is to it.
"The time has not come when Zep
pelins can cross the ocean so these
Bremen merchants thought they would
try a submarine. I have kept secret
the details, all this time, to insure
the success of the project. We expect
ed her several days ago. Her crew
must have endured great hardships
and to them of course the credit for
the success of the undertaking is
chiefly due."
Public Barred
If present plans are carried out the
public will not be allowed to inspect
the undersea wonder, nor will any
body except the federal authorities
be allowed to board her.
The pier of the Eastern Forward
ing company was boarded up yester
day to shut out the view of the curious

ONE MAN IS KILLED AND SEV
ERAL BUILDINGS ARE DE
STROYED BY HEAVY WIND
Bismarck, N. D., July 11.—John
Loth, 18 years old, was instantly kill
ed when lightning struck the Chris
Diede home, four miles west of Glen
Ullen, where a dance was being given
in honor of Chris M. Diede, and Anna
Ulmer, married Sunday morning.
Bismarck Affected
More damage was done by lightning
in Bismarck than by any storm in
many years. The telephone service
was demoralized. The lightining
struck three cables and put out of
commission 150 telephones.
W. E. Reeves, manager of the Inde
pendent Telephone company, said last
night that a storm in this city had
never damaged the telephone service
as did Sunday's.
Depot Struck
Lightning struck the Northern Pa
cific depot while the waiting room was
packed with passengers for No. 1. No.
one was hurt, and the only damage it
did was to knock off one corner of
the cupola.
Large trees were blown down all
over the city doing considerable dam
age to the telephone service.
Farms Damaged
A barn belonging to Fritz Frederick
of Morton county was blown down
and the farm buildings of John
Kiedel, and Frank Suchy, were also
caught in the path of the storm, and
destroyed.
Mandan itself was not touched, but
miles south, the gale struck with
tremendous fury the extent of the
damage is not yet known.
The wires are all down and the
roads are impassable.
The crop damage will be light. The
wind did little damage as the grain
was not far enough advanced, and the
water that fell helped considerably.
EARLY INSPECTION OF
SEEDS URGED BY BOLLEY
H. L. Bolley, state pure seed com
missioner, has issued letters to the flax
seed growers, durum wheat growers
and others, relative to the inspection
of seeds, urging that they make appli
cation for such inspection.
"If you are growing any crop from
which you expect to have seed to sell
to seed dealers or direct to growers
for sowing purposes, now is the time
to make application to have the seed
laboratory inspector come and exam
ine your fields,'' says Prof. Bolley.
"Our force and funds are limited.
We aim to make a specialty of in
specting wilt resistant flax, durum
fields with reference to admixtures
and disease, and bromegrass fields
for quackgrass. We will of course
inspect any other fields by special re
quest if convenient to our scheduled
route of inspectors.
"Any grower or group of growers
wishing this work done should write
at once. Give your farm location,
railway station etc., and state if you
are willing to meet the inspector and
drive him to the fields.
"Address H. L. Bolley, state seed
commissioner, Agricultural college
North Dakota."
NOW SHIPPING FOOD
INTO MEXICO FROM U. S.
Nogales, Ariz., July 11.—Shipment
of food from the United States into
Sonora was resumed today after an
interruption of three weeks, when
eight carloads of garbanzos, a species
of chick pea, crossed the international
line.
Reports from the interior of the
state indicate a number of peons are
on the verge of famine, and the ar
rival of food is eagerly awjiited.
Negotiations were begun today in
Nogales and Sonors between officials
of the Southern Pacific railroad in
Mexico and authorities of the Mexi
can de facto crovernment to turn the
road back to the company for opera
tion. Since the beginning of the re
cent crisis the road has been in the
hands of the Mexican military.
Four troops of Utah cavalry de

N. P. CONDUCTOR WAS
MURDERED BY DRUNK
Mandan, July 10.—Conductor E.
Brown, aged 54, for a quarter of a
century employed by the Northern
Pacific was foully muredered between
Glendive and Billings last nierht.
He was in charge of the Northern
Pacific train No. 4 and a drunken
man picked a fight when Brown col
lected the tickets. Later the man.
name unknown, walked up behind
Brown as he was seated checking up
receipts and struck him a terrific
blow on the head with a full beer
bottle.
The conductor's skull was terribly
crushed and he died instantly. The
murdered was seized by passengers
and delivered to officers at Glendive.
Brown's body will be brought here
and buried from the home of his only
child Mrs. Hurley Malone.
