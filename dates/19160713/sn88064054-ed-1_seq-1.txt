Business
At a meeting of the patriotic club.
Wld at the residence of Mrs. A. N. 1
Obbs, it was decided to open per
smaent headquarters, and at nine
dock Wednesday morning one of
1 vice presidents assisted by two
5ampfire girls were rea'iy to look
after any business that may come
up.
The office will be open daily
except Sunday from nine until four
adock, and any information desired
may be obtained here.
It was most gratifying to hear of
bw many of the young ladies from
allsections of the city offered their
rvices, and things are arranged in
such a manner that nearly all of
them will be given a chance to show
their patriotism by aiding the cause
in one way or another.
The fifteen vice presidents will,
ech serve one day at a time, so
that each will be on duty twice a
moth, and assisted by the clerks.
will be amply able to attend to all
business that may come up.
The subscription list is growing
daily, many contributing individual
ly while societies, clubs, etc., are
devising new means every day to
hilpswell the fund. The Patriotic
Qub has entire charge of the selling
of the tickets for the ball garr e

home team won both gamnes. All
.Uallthe event was the most en
oYable ever held lere.
At 2:30 P. M. next Saturday after-; i
noon the fat men on one side, and
the lean ones on the other, will line
up to play what undoubtly will be e
the 'best (or the worst) game of f,
base bail ever witnessed on the
local grounds.
The keenest rivalry exists between
the two factions, and arguments
pro and con are heard on both sides.
Sleuths that have been put out
by both sides brings the information a
that both teams are indulging in
secret practice, each trying to slip
something over on the other, but at
the present writing it seems as
though the leans are the favorites if
for no other reason than that they
can circle the bases in faster time.
But then on the other hand the fats
cover so much more ground (get it)
that it will be hard for their oppon
ents to find a spot on the fiield that
is not covered.
The line up on both sides is made
up of men who know the game (at
least they think they know it) and l
it is fully understood that the
umpire's decisions are final, unless S
there be a grievance, and if he can
not be convinced through argument
that he is in the wrong, nothing
heavier than a pop bottle may be
used to make him see the errors of
his ways. Under no circumstances
may the bats be used in settling an
argument, these being on the
grounds solely for swatting the ball I
not the umpire.
It is expected that a record break
ing crowd will be on hand to root
for their respectives sides, and in
consideration that the entire pro- 1
ceeds will be turned over to the
patriotic club, no doubt ground
rules will be neccessary.
Mrs. W. H. Sullivan, chairman of
the patriotic club assisted by various
committees will have charge of the
disposition of the tickets and the
gate at the ground will also be care
fully guarded by these ladies to see
that no one slips in without pro
ducing the necessary. The price
of admission is 35 cents for gentle-.
men and 15 cents for ladies and
children,
The line up follows,

TERPSICHOlElANS HELP
SWELL PITiIOTIC FUND
The Ball given by the Terpsichore
ans at the Pine Tree Inn for the
benefit of the Patriotic Club was a
decided success, inasmuch that a
goodly sum was realized. The fol
lowing letter speaks for itself:
Bogalusa, La., July 5, 1916
Dear Mrs. Sullivan:
It affords us great pleasure to en
close herewith check amounting to
$38.00, representing the net pro
ceeds of our dance given last night
at the Pine Tree Inn, which we
cheerfully donate to the Patriotic
Fund. The attendance was unu
sually large and everyone had a
great time. We, indeed, feel very
proud to be able to assist in this
splendid cause and wish to enlist
our services towards anything we
can do in the future for the enlarge
ment of the Patriotic Fund.
Respectfully yours,
THE TERPSICHOREAN.
V. PICO, Chairman of Committee.
CARD OF THANKS.
We take this opportuniiy to ex
press our gratitude to "The Terpsi
chorean" for their generous dona
tion. which we assure them is
appreciated to the fullest extent.
We also wish to thank them for
the offer of their future co-operation.
Respectfully,
PATRIOTIC COMMITTEE.

Allies Now On Offensive Smash
German Line and Gain Much Ground
Germany for the first time since
the Battle of the Marne is face to
face with a critical situation: and
nothing could be more significant of
the changed conditions than the
admission by Berlin that German
troops are retreating from a part of
the line on the eastern front in the
face of superior pressure by the
Russians.
Earlier in the war when Germany
was startling the world with her
evidence o, military prowess, she
nmoved vast forces, the flower of her
armies. from one front to another
as emierrencv demanded. She held
the western front against the com
binedl British, French and Belgians,
while she rescued Austria from
complete defeat, drove the Russians
back across the Carpathians and
connluered Galicia and Poland and
vast areas of Russia proper. She
showed herself capable of sustaining
herselfon both fronts while she
joined Austria in crushing Serbia
and opening a way to Constanti
nople.
But she acknowledges her inability
to do this now. She cannot termi
nate the battle of Verdun by with
drawing large forces to other sectons
without confessing to the greatest
military blunder she has made. She
cannot draft reserves from the
Russian front to stop the British and
French in the battle of the Somme
without inviting a paralyzing defeat
in the east, where the collapsing
Austrian resistance threatens her
own retirement from ground won
with so much blood. She cannot
weaken her western front to stay
the Slavish torrent without risking

most desirous that the existing de

sippi. A washout occurred on the
main line of the N. O. G. N, near
Lees Creek, and although trains
were unable to run direct through
to New Orleans, nevertheless the
efficient way in which passenger
traffic was handled was worthy of
the highest comment, Trains ran
from both the north and the south
as far as the washout, all passen
gers, mail and express was trans
I ferred and trains going either way
arrived at their destination less
than two hours late. The shore line
was not so fortunate, several bridges
going out, but at this time all
trains are running on regular
schedule.

ra decisive defeat in that quarter.
These are, therefore, perilous days
for Germany; for whether or not she
can hold her own frontiers indefinite
ly against the onslaught of her
enemies, steadily growing in military
power, the re-conquest of the terri
tory she has occupied and the driv
ing of her armies back into her own
borders would spell her defeat in
j the war.
History is being made rapidly in
these days and a failure of Germany
to turn the tide now running against
her will make the end of the war in
the third year of its existance by no
means a remote possibilitv.

Lucille and Jim James, colored,

Bachelor Quarters.
H. E. Baumgarten. H. H. Smith
and E. A. Holcombe have recently
moved into the beautiful bungalow
owned by the former located on
North Border Drive, where they
have established bachelor quarters.
The place is fitted up in a most
homelike way, and with the addition
of a new piano which Mr. Baumgar
ten purchased the other day, makes
it one of the most desirable places
in the city for the enjoyment of
single blessedness.
ALUMNI OF BOGALUSA HIGH SCHOOL
SEND GOODI[ES TO COMPANY 6
Cakes, Sandwiches, Cigars. Cigarettes and Many
Other Good Things Sent to the Boys in
Camp at Alexandria
That the patriotic spirit is preval
ent above everything else in Boga
lusa is best attested by the fact that S
the Alumni of the Bogalusa High
School, Monday sent a big box of
goodies to the boys at Camp Staf
ford. While the fare served at the E
camp is of the most nourishing
kind, yet the members of the Alum
ni realized that the little "extras"
would come in handy and would be
appreciated by the boys, Through
the efforts of the Misses Edna Bue- hi
vens and Ruby Moak, assisted by si
every member of the Alumni, a big m
box filled with good things was sent
from here Monday. Each and every in
one was more than anxious to con
tribute their share, and the home
made cakes, doughnuts, etc.. that fr
went into the package will surely
be relished by those who receive d
them. It is this spirit which keeps
Bogalusa in the lime light as the
livest city in the entire South, and
each and every one who partook in
this noble work is to be congratu
lated by the entire community. h
-LEISLATURE ADJOURNS o
Two hundred and eighty acts, a
total short of that of the 1914 ses
sion and in excess of that of 1912,
is the product of the 1916 session of
the General Assembly which closed
t Wednesday. In 1912, 258 acts were
written on the statute books, and
. in 1914, 312 were enacted.
The session broke all records for
a the last day of the session. Through ,
a rule which prohibited introduc
tion of bills during the last twenty t
days of the session, both houses C
were able to catch up with their
t work during the closing week, and
before midnight on the fifty-ninth t
day had cleared the state except t
for odds and ends. Thirty minutes
sufficed for disposition of all bills
pending and the balance of the day
'the two chambers marked time
awaiting signature of the bills by
s the governor.
e At 6 o'clock Tuesday Governor
Pleasant had completed consider
. ation of the 285 bills sent to his
, desk. Two hundred and eighty he
i had signed and five he picked for
. pocket veto. The two chambers
a met just after the dinner hour, re
n ceived the messages of the governor
and adjourned.

SOUTHNEED NOT FEAR
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
Experts Declare That Dis
ease Is Rare In South
ern States
Louisiana or the south generally
has little to fear from infant paraly
sis, which is daily snuffing out so
many little lives.
Unlike the north which is suffer
ing from this epidemic the people
below the Mason and Dixie Line
have enjoyed considerable freedom
from this destroyer of children.
"The organism which causes this
disease has never been isolated, as
far as I know," said Dr. Gallant, as
sistant superintendent of the Chari
ty Hospital at New Orleans. "Some
years ago, Dr. Simon Flexner, of the
Rockefeller Foundation, announced
he had discovered the germ, but he
has not exhibited it. The symptoms
of the disease are chiefly these: The
patient shows gastric disturbances,
is inclined to be extremely nervous.
is dazed by sunlight, and becomes
very restless. Later thete is a stif
fening or hardening of the muscles
which produce a sort of paralytic
state. This denotes a development
of the disease, and the patient
should be sent at once to the near
est hospital.
"As to the treatment, it varies
with the patient. Electric massage
is one of the means used to combat
the disease, but it would be diffi
cult to name a sure cure. The con
dition of infantile paralysis gener
ally extends over a, long period of
time, and each sufferer should be
treated symptomatically."
Dr. G. C. Boudousque, however,
names a specific cure for the dis
ease. Although other physicians
would not indorse it, they admitted
it might be efficacious. It is the use
of a series of colloidal silver salts
r baths, both externally and internalrv.
SPEEDE[S BEWARE
Several owners and auto drivers
rare entirely ignoring of the ordinance
pertaining to speed of automobiles
lin the city. Several accidents have
been narrowly averted and the lives
of many are in daily perl from these
wreckless drivers. The ordinances
pertaining to speed, lights and un
neccessary noises are all very plain,
and those caught violatijg them in
the future will te summarily dealt
with. While the authorities have
been very lenient with the violators
until now, it is best for all concerned
that those guilty of ignoring the
ordinances be dealt with according
to law, and it is therefore up to all
owners and drivers to see that the
law is obeved.
