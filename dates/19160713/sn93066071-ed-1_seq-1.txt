ALBERT WELLBORN FOR COUNTY JUDGE
I mil o candidate for County Judge
on the Republican ticket nt the pri
mary to be held August 1st, 1010.
Judge J A. Spohn Is my opponent in
this primary.
I cannot meet all the voters in per
sonyou are busy and so am 1 there
fore I take this means ol stating my
position. I believe in rf prompt, clean
administration of the laws, and that
the County Clerk, Court Clerk, Treas
urer and County Judge should "lie In"
their ofllces during business hours
every business day of the week. The
dut es of the other officers call them
away at times. We all know that tln
delays In the trial u( cafes are expen
sive to the tax-payer and n denial of
justice. When the state or .plaiiitlft
Hies its case It thereby announces It
will be ready for trial at the next term.
The law gives the defendant a reason
able time to prepare for trial, o why
not try tho case when the facts arc
fresh and the costs small? To con
tinue the cae, in criminal matters,
means additional expenbe on the tax
navcrs for lurv fees, witness fees, etc.:
in civil cases it means that the poorer
mm nuuKer uuani is iiaraescu aim i
exhausted by lots of time, hotel hills
acd other expenses. If ho wini, he is
crippled or ruined financially. Liti
gants should be made to know that a
case in court means a trial, attended
by delays and expense, nnd should not
be permitted at the cost of the tr.x
paj ers of the cuunty .
If you favor the above rules of prac
tice, vote for me on August 1st. If
you do not faor them, ote for the
other man.

A CORRECTION
In some way a mistake was made in
last week's issue with regard to the
announcement ot 8. A, Mouriquand
for County Commissioner from tho and
District, The type read that Mr,
Mouriquand is a candidate on the
Democratic ticket, when It should have
read Republican. No harm is done by
our error, we trust, and avail ourselves
of this, the first opportunity, to correct
it
