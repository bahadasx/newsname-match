When you've run the game of, pleasure all your work is left
.undone,--.;.; '. . - .-; " . ; '":"-:'' "-'
And you reach the sad awakening that must qpme to everyone,
And you feel the future vacant and your ife a, vac .urn, too,
Then you realize that axioms of temperance are true
Then you'll weigh the joys and sorrows when you've drained
the bitter cup .''"
And the sorrow side comes downward and the joy side goes up!
Then you realize with sadness that the cours you took was
wrong,
That the notes you hetrd were ragtime and! you've missed
the sweetest song. - ',. v j ' '

Railroads of War.
In the possible, but let us hope
improbable,' contingency of an
invasion of this country by hos
tile military forces, the efficien
cy of our railroads would prove
the determining factor of our suc
cess or defeat. Ours is a country
of magnificent distances, and the
forces needed against an enemy
would have to be on the spot
when wanted not afterward.
Our rdads have not been' built
with an eye to their strategi6 im
portance. And since1 there ha?
been more or less talk about na-i
tional security and military pre
paredness, it is not impertinent
to ask "what of railroad prepar
edness?. ".;. " '
Warfare calls for; men by the
thousands and tens. of thousands.
Our army and militia and insig
nificant as compared with .Eur
ope's hosts, and are scattered at
large throughout the country. In
the event of 8iimiltaneou8 at
tacks on the eastern ami western
coast, our forces vould have to
be rushed to varipus points, and
by various routes to repel such
attacksbuthow? ' . '
Has any investigations been
made to determine if .our. rail
roads have adequate facilities
for such an emergency? "Do
me ircKS necessary xor inis ser
vice exist?, Would the commerce
of the country come to a stand
still byieason of the withdrawal
of the necessary rolling stock to
meet such an emergency? Would
existing schedules yield to the
call of arms, or admit of enforce
ment concurrently with the move
ment of our troops? would ex
istingterminals serve our purpose
in such a crisis, or should we" haVe
additional ones for specific mili
tary purposes?
