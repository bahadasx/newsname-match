This store never wab-
bles on the question of greater-value-giving. Our
merchandise is purchased on a quality basis from

We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
value.

Everyone asks this question many
times daily.
We are all dependent upon the time.
Our lives are regulated by our
watches.
The lack of a watch is a big handi
cap to both men and women.
Therefore, why try to get along
without one?
Let us show you a good watch; one
you can depend upon. We can suit
both your taste and your pocketbook.

OREGON GETS
ANOTHERilEDAL
FINAL P. P. I. E. LIST SURPRISES
RavKn Wins Recognition For the Excel
lency of His Work at the Cali
fornia Exposition
C. N. Ravlin, chief of horticulture
for the Oregon Commission at the Panama-Pacific
exposition at San Francis
co last year, has been honored by the
board of the exposition, who have pre
sented him with a collaborator's gold
medal as an expression of appreciation
of his work as a collector of the Ore
gon exhibit and for having been per
sonally responsible for the pomological
display and the upkeep of the exhibit
of shrubs and ferns as well as fruits.
The presentation of the gold medal
came as a surprise to Mr. Ravlin, who
did not know of the award until he
opened a letter from the exposition
commission Monday.
Along with the letter came a list of
final official awards to Oregon exhibit
ors, as made after final checking and
all disputes bad been settled. It has
taken from the end of last November
up to the present time to check over
these lists.
"Hood River certainly has made a
good showing," says Mr. Ravlin.
"One that the county should be proud
of. The valley took higheta award on
pears and her cherries, as the list will
show, were second to none. It will be
noticed in the list that a good many
Hood River exhibitors were given
medals of honor. This is the highest
award an individual exhibitor can re
ceive." In the list is also included the notice
that the state of Oregon has been
awarded a medal of honor for its fresh
deciduous fruit displsy.
"This award has been made since I
left San Francisco," says Mr. Ravlin.
"It was evidently given after the jur
ies bad made a general checking over.
It is certainly a triumph for Oregon,
which was also given the grand prise
for the best arrangement of its dis
plays." Mr.Ravlin points out that The Dalles
and Mosier received some handsome
awards. The best displays from Wasco
county, however, were received at the
exposition from Mosier..
"Mosier, considering the size of the
district," says Mr. Raviln, "is to be
congratulated. Mark A. Mayer, in
competition with 600 cases from Idaho,
a large exhibit from Washington and
many prunes from the Willamette Val
ley and California, took the medal of
honor on bis Italian prunes."
The Hood River valley's Clark Seed
ling strawberries topped anything at
the exposition. The award was made
on a commercial pack.
The official list of Hood River and
Wasco eounty exhibits is as follows :

LITTLE AUTO TRIPS
IN THE MID-COLUMBIA
Whether you have a regular automo
bile or not. vou ouaht to take the trio
to Parkadle over.tbe line ot tbe Mount
Hood Railroad Co. aboard tne new rail
auto. You will not only enjoy tne
scenery spread before you like the
fleeting pictures ol a reel 01 movy
films, but the novelty of the ride will
hneer with vou lor many a long oay
You will have all the joys of automobil
ing without the usual discomforts of a
tour over roada some times bumpy and
dusty. The big 30 passenger White,
driven bv Stanley Shere. an expert
enced mechanician and chauffeur of
nine years' experience, fairly skims
along the rails, its progress is smoother
than that of an electric irony car.
Rv all meana take thia trio while the
summer suns are shining or before the
glorious dsys of a Hood Kiver autumn
have ended. Just elimb aboard down
at the station at the foot of Cascade
avenue. After Mr. Sbere haa cranked
and started up your indrawn breaths
of astonishment will not have ceased
until vou hsve passed Powerdale.
Don't think youjhave reached the
end of the trip, when you aee the lines
of raila terminate about two miles and
a half up Hood river. The machine is
merely being driven to the switennaca
turn table in order that yon may climb
the heavy grt.de that will take you to
the East Side orchard diatrictbeadfirat
instead of backwards like a doodle bug.
Before your admiration of tha well
ordered apple tracts at the top of the
East Side grade, many of them lined
with green or ripening grain, haa con
sumed itself, yea have paased Van
Horn and are headed straight for
OdslL J oat thia aide of Odeil station
the rail line runa in a straight Una due
west, and for a time you seem to be
equidistant from the shimmering peaks
of Hood and Adama. The line will
suddenly switch off on another curve,
you will bo taken to the right and
Hood's hoary head, always growing
larger and more dazsling, ia at your
left A moment later you will aee it
over your right aboofder. Thua you
keep up thia "peep eye" game, as sou
try to watch orchard acenea, China
pheasants, grasing herds, a frisking
cslf, fat pigs in clover, a digger squir
rel hustling to its borrow or a glimpse
of the cascading stream of Hood river,
until you have reached Dee. At Dee
you are interested in the hustle and
bustle of lumber pliers. Big teams of
Percherona draw trucks laden with
newly ripped fir boards and timbers.
The steady buss of the big band aaw
and lesser circular saws all come from
the great plant at the right It may
be that you will have time to see the
dam across the Middle Fork and the
new fish ladder erected to allow trout
and steelhead, rainbow and Chinook to
climb to the headwaters of the East
and Middle Forks.
You leave Dee and soon you see
Mount Hood straight ahead. When
you have reached Parkdale, if the
weather is clear, the mountain is big
ger than you have ever aeen it before,
provided you have never taken a trip
to the Upper Valley.
You ought to take along a picnic
lunch and spend a part of the day in
some of the groves near Parkdale. The
walk to Woodwortb's lava bed park is
not long and can be made easily in 16
minutes.
If you do not car to go aa far as
Parkdale, numerous points arc avail
able along the different branchea of
Hood river for good fishing. You may
leave the auto car at Winans and spend
the greater part of a day at the Devil's
Punch Bowl, that ia, if you take the
early morning car, where tha flab bite
excellently. Bloucher and Holatein are
also good stations for a day a fishing
headquarters.
The new rail auto has proven even
more popular than the Mount Hood
management had expected. The ma
chine ia crowded going and coming
these summer days.
Passengers are heard to utter often
the predictiion that tha day ia not far
distsnt when electric cara will make
more accessible the Upper Valley re
sorts and even that Lost Lake will be
reached by comfortable electric service.
Try the Mount Hood Company's new
White, and see if you don't think such
a service of the greatest appeal.
MILLER TOLL BRIDGE
TO BE THE TARGET
In all probability some concerted ac
tion will be taken in the near future by
citizens of Wasco and Sherman counties
to abolish tha old Miller toll bridge
across the Deschutes river, according
to A. D. Moe, who returned Monday
from an automobile trip to Wasco.
K. C. At wood, a promient business
man of Wasco and manager of the bank
and branch store of the Wasco Ware
house & Mililng Co., is beading a mon
ster petition that is widely signed by
Sherman county citizens and which,
when hnal signaturea have been se
cured, will be presented to the Wasco
county court about August 1. Mr. At-
wood is circulating copies ot the peti
tion himself, and be ia sending copies
in automobiles throughout remote parts
of the county. A delegation of Sher
man county road enthusiasts in a bat
tery of 100 a'utomobiles, according to
plans, will call on the Wssco county
court and ask that tbey cooperate in
the necessary steps to take over the old
bridge, which is now owned by Mal
colm Moody, of The Dalles.
A move similar to that of tne Sher
man county citizens is on foot at The
Dalles. Judd Fish and others will sim
ultaneously present similar petitions.
It is said by motorists, wbo have re
cently passed through this city and who
almost unanimously direct criticism
against the two counties for allowing
the toll bridge, which connects the
roads of the two counties, that a toll
of f 1 is charged for a machine crossing
the structure. The aetual value of the
bridge is placed at $100, and it is said
that on many days the total toll re
ceipts exceed this figure.
Sherman county citizens claim that
they have long been willing to meet
Wasco county half way and take over
the toll bridge, but that tha Wasco
county court has always been apathetic
on the matter.
Motorists ssy that one of the steepest
errades. a climb of about 18 per cent
on Wasco county's extension of the Co
lumbia Kiver highway is to be found at
the west approach to tbe bridge.
A new survey, made by the State
Highway Commission.will give a grade
leading to the bridge of no more than
five per cent.
ASS'N MEMBERS TO
VOTE SATURDAY
Despite the fact that it ia a busy
season with orchardists, officials of tbe
Apple Growers Association think that
a quorum will be present at the meet
in of the organisation called for next
Saturday, when the quest ion of voting
on tbe proposed affiliation with tha
Friut Growers Agency, will come up,
"In fact" va O. B. Nye, "we
must have a quorum. If we fail thia
time, we will aimply have to call an
other meeting."
The growers as a whole are in favor
of the proposed affiliation. If the' As
sociation joins tbe government move
ment which now seems an aaaured
happening, practically the entire ton
naa-e of the Hood River .valley will
come under tbe orderly control of the
central agency. Practically all inde
pendent shippers, who in former sea
sons have handled more than 100 car
loads of apples, in the past few months
hsve joined tbe Apple Growers Associ
ation.
The Fruit Growers' Exchange, be
cause of its affiliation with the North
western Fruit Exchange, will become
a passive member of the Spokane
agency.
J. C Butcher left Monday for Sao
Franctfco. where he will visit his
mother, Mrs. Isabel! Butcher.
CHAUTAUQUA
IS SUCCESSFUL
MANY PRESENT AT ALL PROGRAMS
Musicians, Singers, Lecturers and Orators
Make Appeal -Event Closed
Monday Night
While the affair waa not so success
ful financially aa bad been hoped by
the orchardists, professional and busi
ness men of the city who promoted it.
the fifth Hood River Chutauqua. brought
to a cloae Monday night by Kekuku'a
Hawaiian quintet, waa in every other
way a great auccess. All programa
have been well attended, and especial
ly have large crowds been present to
bear the musical numbers and speak
ers at the evening performances.
Tbe Chautauqua was begun last
Wednesdsy morning, when King Ar
thur's Court, a feature for the young
people of city and valley, waa organ
ized. Wednesday afternoon the Ionian
Serenadera rendered appealing musical
numbers and readings were given by
Ruth Meeker. S. Piatt Jones, humor
ist appeared with the Ionian Serenad
era Wednesday evening.
Thursday afternoon Dr. Elliott A.
Boyl delivered his remarkable lecture,
"The Seen and the Unseen." Thurs
day evening Victor Murdock lectuied.
Mr. Murdock, Progressive representa
tive in congress from Kansas, is a ram
pant fire eater. He has a gift of
words and a way of impressing those
who hear him. Mr. Murdock indulged
in an extravagant arraignment of
many of his fellow national law mak
ers. He touched on tbe Japanese situ
ation. In a way his lecture may be
called the "plum pudding" of the re
cent chautauqua. It was full of thought
and word condiments bard to digest.
Friday afternoon Dr. Arthur C.
Frankze, a minister of note, gave his
lecture-sermon, "The Matchless Book."
No event of the cbauatuqua was more
beneficial to local people than that of
Friday night when Ernest J. Sias
talked on"Home Town Preparedness."
Mr. Sias' talk waa not filled with hack
neyed aphorisms such as one might ex
pect from a man traveling from town
to town delivering chautauqua lectures.
He spoke on "Hood River Home Town
Preparedness."
"I have given your situation some
consideration since I have been here,
although I have necessarily bad but a
short period in which to do it," said
Mr. bias.
Mr. Sias went back a few vears and
touched on the orchard boom period.
He saw the potential factionalism that
exists between a portion of rural peo
ple and the man of the city. "Don't,
expect to sell a newcomer land worth
$500 an acre for $2000 and expect to
getaway with it, waa one of hia
statements. He urged the men of the
town to come in closer contact with
those of tha country. He advised that
both country man and city man attempt
to view problems arising not only from
his own viewpoint, but as well from
that of the other man.
Mr. Sais' lecture Twill fprobablv be
long remembered by the people of
Hood River who heard it. It will have
a beneficial effect.
The Gullotta Trio appeared at both
the afternoon and evening perform
ances Thursday and Friday the Lryic
Operatic Co. waa here at both preform
ances. Tbe Witepskie's Royal Hungarian
Orchesrta rendered Saturday 'a musical
entertainment. Saturday afternoon
Mrs. Hariett Gunn Roberson gave her
lecture. "Success Where You Are."
and Saturday night popular selections
were rendered by ray Morvilius.
LOCAL CANNERIES
RUN FULL BLAST
The two cannery plants of Hood Riv-
er.Jthat of the Hood River Canning Co.
located in the city and the J. K. New
ton plant in the Belmont district, are
operating full blast. It is probable
that the canned product irom tbe val
ley will double that of any former sea
son, and reach approximately 10,000
cases.
The Hood River Canning Co., owned
by H. R. Larkin and E. B. Cloud, has
been employing about 100 men, women
and girls. The company has been oper
ating daily free buses between the
lower city and tbe Heights for the con
venience of its workers. At tbe first of
the season it appeared that tbe yield of
canning product would run short. The
intervening rains, nuwever.imve causea
hundreds of crates of the communities'
largest and finest fruit to be sold to
canneries, and thia year's pack will
probably be of extra high grade.
"Kaln, ssys Mr. Larkin. "does not
in the least affect a strawberry for
canning purposes, if tbe fruit is deliv
ered before mould has begun."
Both canneries are now handling both
strawberries and cherries. Tbe city
plant will later can pears and apples,
but no vegetables.
The Belmont plant or Mr. Newton,
which will pack about 2,000 cases this
year, is more of a home concern. Mr.
Newton is putting out he says, a
strictly first-class product. He plans
on devoting the winter months to the
packing .of preserves, msde from local
fruits.
BASEBALL
(By Earl Weber)
Hood River's Independents met with
their first defeat of the year at Mosier
Sunday, taking the count 8-1." Up to
tbe seventh inning it was an interesting
pitchers' battle but in Moaier's half of
that lucky inning and again in the
eighth, infield errora and numerous past
balls allowed the Mosier boys to run up
the lop sided score.
Fisber pitched a two Jut game for
Mosier and struck out 18 batters. It
seemed to be a "strike out" day. as
Heppner, for Independents, whiffed 19
ana allowed four bits, all of the scratch
variety.
Moreland, Hood River's regular
catcher, was unable to make the trip
and the sub-catcher could not hold
Heppner'a shoots. Seven of the eight
runa were scored on passed balls. Sev
eral fair fans accompanied tbe team
but tbeir chancea to root for their
hopefula were aa acarce as Hood Riv
er's runs. '
