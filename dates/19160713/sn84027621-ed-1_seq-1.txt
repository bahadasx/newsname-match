Excite the Wonder and Increase the
hension of their Enemies"
SUCCESSFULLY WAGIIIG WAR
London, July 12. The - recovery of
the Russian armies since their 1915
defeats and their apparently inex
haustible supply of guns and ammuni
tions, continues the source of wonder
among military writers. There are at
least six great Russian armies engag
ed , against the "Austrians and Ger-
mans on Russia's western front. All
are using great quantities of ammuni
tion. The Russians in Armenia and
Persia have been fighting the Turks
vigorously for months. A few weeks
ago these were compelled to fall back.
, This week the Russians again resum
l ed the offensive, causing the Turks to
retire twenty-five miles. Meanwhile
the armies south of the Pinsk marshes
are righting a pitched battle with the
; Teutons along the Stokhod river. It
will probably be some days before a
'. decision is reached as the Teutons are
S fighting hard to save Kovel. North of
the marshes, the fighting is confined
largely to artillery. In Galicia the
j Russians are reforming to continue
7 the offensive. '
