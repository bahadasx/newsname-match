1 J Gloomy Report on European War Situation Made by Rev. Dr.
Ij Charles F. Aked, American Delegate to Neutral
I Conference in Stockholm.
I Stockholm, June 21. (Correspond-
I ence of The Associated Press). Re-
gardless of the decision history will
record as to the victor and vanquish
I ' ed In the great North sea fight of May
9 31 and June 1, there is no denying
the fact that the battle brought a
M sudden stiffening to the so-called "war
I party" in Germany. All talk of Ger-
9 many being willing to end the war on
I j a basis of the ante-bellum status quo
I I ended!
- It Is being given out now in neutral
jfl I Europe that Germany will require "a
t slight rectification of her frontier at
KM the expense of Belgium.'' It is furth-
M er asserted that it will be necessary
$fl'i for the central powers to keep a strip
S of SerDia in order that the railway
jfl to Constantinople shall always run
9 through "friendly country." Germany
fl ' always has maintained that her coloh-
1 les should be returned to her It is
now added that there must be compen
sation for German losses in the Congo.
r Something also must bo done. It is
9 , t stated, "to keep Belgium free from
fl , -' being the vasal state of England."
"m ' Aked In Berlin.
IM ' The Rev. Dr. Charles Aked of San
M l Francisco, one of the American dele--jfl
; gates to the neutral conference for
M continuous mediation sitting in Stock
's '' holm, was in Berlin on a mission of
fl ; peace at the time of the North sea
,fl.' fight It is commonly reported ho
Ifl o' was.there by invitation of the German
fl:'r government. At any rate he seems
M to have had no difficulty in obtaining
)fl audiences from most of the higher of
fl ' ' ficials. The peace conference had en-M-
tertalned the hone that Germany
jfl . would outline peace terms of a char
fl ' acter so extremely moderate as to
fl command immediate respect in all the
9 neutral countries, thus bringing about
9 a public opinion to which belligerents
ievenuiaiiy wouia nave tu uawu.
Gloomy Report Made.
Dr. Aked brought back a very
M ? gloomy report. There seemed to be
fl ' no thought anywhere that the war
fl . would end within another year. The
H i new statement of peace terms that
would be demanded by the new "war
H f party," coupled with the governmental
H announcement that peace could be had
H i only upon a basis of consideration for
H , the military situation of the opposing
M t armies and without consideration, or
9 result of the war, appears to have
9 ' chilled even the most ardent of the
9 ' peace advocates abiding In the Swed
9 ', Ish capital. Just a short while before
9 ! the naval battle the German element
9 In Stockholm was proclaiming the fact
9 that Germany was willing to bring hos
9 tillties to a close and to evacuate ail
9 ' occupied territory in exchange for i
9 captured German colonies over seas.
9- Neutral Nations Disregarded.
9 Dr. A"ked is said to have suggested
9 to officials in Berlin that the neutral
9 nations would not look with favor up
9 on German retention of any of Bel
9 glum and to have received the answer:
9 "The neutral nations are not going
B to dictate to the 120,000,000 of the cen-
I -tral powers. Wo have bought the land
I of Belgium with our blood. Germany
H p must be protected agnlnst future at-
tacks. Shall we give back all we
H have won at such great cost? Shall
H ' we give up the valuable coal and Iron
H' lands of France now in our hands?
H As to Serbia and Montenegro they
, have had their lesson, I hope. "We
will leave Austria to deal with them.
; Time Not Ripe For Peace.
H ,( Even the extreme pacifists in Ger-
9 -many are said to have told the emis-
9 ' pary from the neutral conference that
9 .1 the time was not ripe for overtures of
j39r peace, Irrespective of the conflicting
3fl claims of victory It was said the naval
9 light had lengthened the war by
Sfl ; twelve months at: least. The only
Jfl j thing the pacifists' could do was to
Mr wait for the right moment and seize
J9 ; It when it came.
H Germans Are Confident.
3B . Dr. Aked reported to the conference
39 ; that he found everywhere In Germany
19 f , lhe conviction that the German arm-
j9 t les cannot be beaten in the field and
9 , that the allies cannot exhaust German
9 : resources. Money and men seemed
:9 to he plentiful, he said, and an Ameri-
9 ' can 1IvlnS ln Berlin asserted there
'9 ere hundredB of thousands of men,
9 ; trained to the minute, who hud not
9 ! yeL been on any firing line. Extrem-
J9 f iats of the "war partv" were most
9 , confident in their military claims. They
9v asserted that they had no fear of the
Am ) English or Russian armies because ol
r9 j lue'r deficiency In trained officers.
9 "j Strong Feeling Against U. S.
;9 f i It la said Dr. Aked (found very little
9 1
sentiment favoring the United States
as a mediatory agent. There Is a
strong feeling in Germany against the
United States, engendered partly by
the submarine controversy.
Dr. Aked Interviewed In Germany a
number of men who last July issued
a protest against the suggested annex
ation of Belgium. This protest de
scribed annexation as "a political
blunder fraught with grave consequen
ces and calculated to strengthen but
fatally to weaken the German empire,"
and further stated:
"We subscribe to the principle that
the policy of annexation in the case
of the peoples accustomed to political
independence is to be rejected."
Some Moderate Men In Germany.
"This utterance is a voice that noth
ing can silence" said Dr. Aked. "But,
of course, these moderate men are not
the only men of influence in Germany
and will not have matters their own
way when it comes to a settlement.
Between the moderate men and the
war party there is constant strife. The
continuance of the war, the nature
and conduct of the war are issues
sharply drawn between a "better Ger
many' and the 'war party.' It Is really
of more importance to the world as to
which of these parties shall win In
Germany, than the more popular ques
tion of who will be victorious in the
trenches. If the jingoes win, the
world will have to deal with a very
different Germany a Germany flush
ed with victory and uncompromising
in her triumphs, or else the world
must look with anguish upon years of
fiercer war while the best fruits or
civilization are utterly destroyed."
Dr. Aked said he found much to
encourage him, however, as to Ger
many's possible attitude after the war
toward arbitration "as a law above the
sword."

Mexicans Very Friendly Since
Crisis Between Country and
United States Seems
Averted.
RAINY SEASON IS ON
Embargo on Food and Cloth

Order Remains Unchanged.
Washington, July 13 General Persh
ing reported today that It was general
ly believed by Mexicans and foreigners
along the line of communication of his
expedition that a crisis between the
United States and Mexico had been
averted and this brought about a new
friendly relationship between the
Americans and Mexicans.
"Mexicans in this vicinity and along
the railroad" the dispatch said, "are
reported very friendly toward Ameri
cans In the last few days. IL Is gen
erally believed that trouble between
the United States and Mexico has been
settled. The rainy Reason is on In
earnest, heavy rains being reported
from tho various stations along the
line during the last few days. Will
report within a day or two effects of
rain upon roads and general prospects
regarding road maintenance."
Customs collectors along the bor
der have been instructed upon request
of the state department to permit rail
road rolling stock to enter Mexico by
equitable exchange or cars. For every
car permitted to enter Mexico, the
order stipulates, a car from Mexico
shall enter American territory.
The collectors also are Instructed
not to Interfere further with ship
ments of food and clothing Into Mex
ico It is understood, however, that
te present method of handling war
munitions destined to points beyond
the border shall contlnuo In force un

Washington, July 13. President
Wilson told a citizenship convention
here today that the American govern
ment must insist that foreigners be
coming citizens remain loyal even if
they are not pleased with the way
affairs are conducted. Ixyalty means
nothing, he said, unless it is coupled
with self sacrifices. He added that
Americans cannot teach loyalty unless
they practice It.
The president discussed at length
the problem of Americanizing foreign
born citizens. His words were enthus
iastically applauded by a large gather
ing of men and women educators in
terested in the instruction of new citi
zens meeting here under the auspices
of the Naturalization Bureau of the

jects of the convention saying it was
not fair to allow multitudes of people
from foreign lands to come into this
nation without giving them Intimate
Instruction which will show them the
objects of America
Native-born Americans were warn
ed by the president to examine them
selves carefully to see whether they

U-BOAT'S VISIT
CAUSESCONCERN
State Department Sees Prob
able Complications If
Deutschland Should Be
Sunk in Atlantic
by Allies.
Washington, July 13. Although
the contention of the British and
French embassies that the German
submarine Deutschland at Baltimore
Is a potential warship has had little
weight at the state department in
view of the department's information
that the vessel Is purely a merchant
ship, officials today saw that other
bothersome questions might arise in
connection with the undersea boat's
visit.
Already, It was said, consideration
is being given to a suggestion that
the government should withhold news
of the boat's sailing to prevent In
formation reaching the allies. The
department Is concerned too, as to
the boat's treatment If discovered by
enemy cruisers In the Atlantic. Un
der the ruling that the vessel Is a
merchant craft the state department
could not countenance its sinking In
violation of International law.

that tho government had decided to

conviction that the workmen would
co-operate in this plan so as to make
it plain to Great Britain's foes that
the offensve In Its present intensity
of bombardment and assault would If
necessary be "continued Indeflnite!
ly." "That offensive," he continued, "Is
only in its beginning and it necessar
ily requires for Its success a. continu
ous supply of munitions of all kinds.
From the success achieved we have
been able to gauge the paramount ne
cessity of avoiding even the slight

munitions In the field, not merely in
the weeks Immediately before us but
until our objective is achieved. There
must be no slackening of the output

ORPET DEFENSE
REVIEWS CASE
Attorney Potter Defends Al
leged Murderer's Witnesses
and Discrepancies in
Their Testimony.
Waukegan, 111b , July 13. The final
scenes in the long drawn out trial
of Will H. Orpet, former university
student charged with the murder of
Marion Lambert in Helm's woods
last February began to materialize
today with the assurance that in all
probability the end of the case would
be reached by Saturday night At
least it was believed that tho jury
would begin its deliberations by that
time.
Waukegan, Ills., July 13. Resum
ing his argument for the defense to
day, in the case of William II. Orpet,
charged with the murder of Marion
Lambert, Attorney Ralph F. Potter
defended the integrity of his own wit
nesses, particularly II. J. Carlln, the
investigator. The state Insinuated
that Carlln (persuaded state witnesses
to change their testimony. Not one
word of proof had been brought
against the investigator,1 Potter said.
The attorney then turned to Joser
phino Davis, who spent the night with
Marion on February S, the day before
the latter's death. At the Inquest
and to state's officers Miss Davis said
Marlon was happy, never made a
threat of suicide, and never cried.
. "I was angry at Orpet for what he
did to Marion; I thought him guilty
and wanted to say things that would
hurt him," Josephine said In her tes
timony. "I talked to my mother and
gradually It dawned on me that I had
no right to act that way."
Mr. Potter said that no one could
disbelieve this open confession of
Josephine's. A more girl, he said,
she found that her words had a
weight more serious than she had
realized. Her feeling in spite had led
her Into a great wrong, the lawyer
said, and she purged her soul of It on
the stand.
