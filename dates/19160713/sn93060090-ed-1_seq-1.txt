To the Readers of tbe
CRESSET,.
.. i .
Dear readers, we have the
greatest of Interest in your eter
nal welfare. -We believe that you
are better able to look after your
own. financial interest and a
great "deal more capable to do so.
For this reason e must beg .to
call your attention to the lan
guage of Christ Please read.
"Teaching thein to observe all
things whatsoever I litve com
manded you: and lo, I .atn with
you alway, even unto the end of
the world. (Aroen,v (Mat. 2820)
We as -rainjster' of our Lord
and Master nous1: call your atten
tion to this fact, and(as a minist
er we have to toach you all things
and to teach you that you have to
observe them, it you expect to
be a child of his, P(ease read .
,. "Behold the days, i;ome saith
tbe Lord God, that I will send a
famine in the land. not. a faminn
of br?ad, nor a tbirs for water,
but of hearing the words of the
Lord:H-' (Amos. 8-11)
Dear reader If tvr there was
a time wnen there, was' or evor
will be a fumine of .hearing the
word it is now. right now. The
whole world know that there is
something wrong. And when
ever the devil shoots out a ser
vant of his with something which.
will imitate the Truth, where
there is a money making
scheme at the bottom of it. Then
the rich will combine, in getting
the money out of. the hands of
the poor. And the poor will be1
allured into the trap, by the rich
making it appear that tbey be
lieve it. Bat when God presents
his truth, tucTo is no one hardly
that wishes to believe it. Nov
dear readers jou who have bwu
reading the CttiviSET why do you
not stop for a short time and
think. For- every Cresset that
comfes to your hand warns you,
of tbe great fact that there is a
great famine in the world that Is
,of hearing the word. And from
all appearance and evidence you
will not stop and think,. Tbe
Cresset is the bigest preacher
tbat has ever come to tbe people
sinco the death of th lifot A-
postle. Who was burned at the
stake, in Rome. It tells you of
aU things', commanded by . the
Lord and Master. And teaches
you to,observe them.. But you
will not take its teachings, neit h
er will you observe what it says
to vou And yet, yon are in the
woiSt famine which has ever
come upon tbe world. White this
is afact. In connection with this
famine; there will be many who
will starve to death for tho want
of bread. And that loo because
tbere U a famine of hearing the
,word. For wherever tbe word
is strictly observed, there will
be no famine of bread, and no one

order to murder and kill the poor
hard working man. So dear
reader please stop now and
think before it is to late.
Formow is the time for all
hard laboring men to unite them
selves intoone grand Brotherhood
under! the Principals of Bible
Socialism. And do not be caught
sleeping: as did the European's
before they went into the Battle
field, and many of them are now
sleeping with the pale nations
of. the dead their wives, with
out a husband, their children
without a father, and are nak
ed and starving. But Oh! dear
r eaders no rich have spilt $heir
blood in the battle field No none
So may God help us to be child
ren of the day as it reads.
"But of the times and the sea
sons brethren, ye have no need
that I write unto you.
For yourselves know perfectly
that the day of the Lord so
cometh ss a thief in the night.
For when they shall say,
Peace and salety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them,
as travail upon a woman, with
child: and they shall not escape,
Tint, v hi-pthren. : are not iff
tbat-tbat day should
overtake you as a thief.
Ye are all the children of the
day: we are not of the night, nor
of darkness.
Therefore let us not sleep as
do others; but let us watch and
be sober.
For they that sleep, sleep in the
night; and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night.
But let us who are of the day.
be sober, putting on tbe breast
plate of faith and love, and for
an helmet the hope of salvation
For God hath not appointod
us to wrath, but to obtain salva

we wake or sleep, we should live
together with him.
Wherefore comfort yourselves
l j ,thof
. '
even as also ye oo.
And we beseech you, brethren
to know tbetn which labour
among you and are over you in
tbe Lord, and admonish you
And to esteem them very high-
lly in love for their works sake.
Ana be at peace among .your
selves. Now we exhort you, brethren
warn them that are- unruly,
comfort tbe feebleminded, sup
port the weak, be patient toward
all men. ' y " . ',
. -.See tbat ijone render evil for
evil utjto any man: but ever fol
low that which is good, both
among vourselves and to all
men." (1 Thess, 5 -1-15.)
Relizing from this scripture
that we as children of God
should not be in darkness as
those of the world. For God said
tbat his word should be a Jaaip
to our feet, and a light to our
pathways po we do hope tbat our
reudei swill come to tho light
and waltt in the light as God is in
the light and. will have fellow
ship one with another and the
blood of Jesus Christ cleans us
from all iin In this" manner you
will preuar your self for the
NO. 6
kingdom of God. And Bible
Socialism will have its day. And
every man will sit under .nis
own vine and fig tree, and no
man dare molest or make afraid.
And the famine of hearing the
word will be pasbed away for
ever. Amen.
WAR
It looks as tbo the . war be
tween Mexico and the United
States will soon turn into peace,
But wo fear thoy cry out peace,
peace, when there is no peace.
It appears that the Allies
are gaining a little ground tor
tbe present, Ltut we must not
think that this will inake peace
just so long as the lords of earth
t.hinlr f.hat thev have not had
enough poor men .killed to giye
them the Supreme.power over
al . Then we can look for peace
to them, But Slavery to all the
poor who are by cnance leic.
Will we never get our eyes
opened.
