VALUES THAT ARE UNEQUALLED
See Them
Summer Dress Goods that
arc new and dainty.
White and sport striped
skirts. Colored wash
goods, white goods.
Lots of ladies low cut
shoes at reduced prices.
Same always new here.
In all the years we have
been seeing and selling (inc clothing, the alue-fiipcrlority
of our goods has never been so strongly emphasized as it
is to-dj. With the shortage of high.class fabrics, the
trouble uith de-stutls, and the increased cost of even
thing that enters into the making of clothes, it has been a
difficult matter to maintain our standard of value. Yet
not only have we done this, but we've actually provided
better values than you've ever got before. We know that
these values are unequalled elsewhere in town. We imlte
you to investigate and see for yourself.
