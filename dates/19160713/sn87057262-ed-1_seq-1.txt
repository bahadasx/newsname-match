[By Webb C. MiUer, United Press

COLUMBUS, N. M„ July 13.—
Heavy patrols of cavalry were on the
alert along tfee border west of here
today, to prevent a raid by a new
band of bandits reported gathering In
the San Simon valley. That the Mexi
cans may be led by one of Villa's liue
tenants, bent on complicating rela
tions between the United States and
Mexico through attacks on border
towns, is feared by army officers.
Customs line raiders brought word
from natives who saw "the new band
riding eastward south of the border
toward Columbus, with the avowed in
tention of making forages into the
United States to raid ranches. Ap
prehension was felt today for the
safety of the ranchers in the Isolated
stretches west of here. The bandits
are reported near the scene of the
murders of William Parker and his
wife a fortnight ago.
The new band is said to be fully
armed and well mounted. Natives
reported only'thirty Mexicans in th?
band, but recruits may bave joined
since. The leader, whose name vras
hot learned, offered recruits the lure
of loot on the American side and
later the prospect of joining some
Mexican faction.
At the base camp here a sqpiad of
ttotorcycles with mounted machine
puna was held in readiness for any

"BAL/TIMORE, iMd., July 13.—Shat
tering of the British starvation block
ade will soon be attempted by a fleet
of giant under-sea freighters flying
the American flag.
Inspired 3y the success of the Ger
man sub-sea freighter Detuschland,
Manager Paul Hilken, of the Ozean
Rhederel, Deutscihland owners, is
forming an American corporation to
make undersea ships that will put
the Deutschland in the pigmy class.
Simon Lake, submarine inventor,
who fully a year ago predicted in a
scientific paper that "we shall prob
albly see some form of cargo-carrying
submarine Constructed as 'blockade
runners," will act in an advisory ca
pacity to the new corporation and
permit the use of his patents.
'Hilken gave the United Press the
following statement of his
American 'manager
the advisability of forming a dompany
to operate, under ,the American flag,
a service sintijar to that begun by
the Ozean Klhederel, with its sub
mersible freighter Deutschland. The
success of the trip of the Deutschland
and the huge profits which are al
ready assured—the cost of that ves
sel being practically paid by her first
voyage—lead those who are plan
ning the new venture to expect It to
prove successful financially."
The caTgo of the submarine
Deutschland, Inspiration for this
enormous plan, was ready today for
loading, preliminary to returning to
Germany. It looked as though the
tug Tlmmons was ready to haul her
away very soon. German Ambassa

LONDON, July 13.—The second
phase of the British offenolve Is ap
proaching a crisis in the battle for
the east of Albert where British
troops are striving to advance two
miles eastward to the heights of Mar
tinpuch.
The Germans have thrown two
whole army corps into action on both
sides of the Albert-Papaum-3 road to
defend the approaches to Bapaume.
They are making the most savage
counter attacks, particularly south
east of Contalmalson, where a Ger
man success would hold up the whole
British advance.
German correspondents, admitting
the great power of the British offen
sive, claim that the attacking forces
have suffered heavy losses compar
able only to the casualties at Ver
dun. British correspondents report
that the English losses have been
severe only in the death grapples for
possession of villages where German
machine guns have played on the
British lines.
No Canadian or Australian troops
have taken part in the Somme offen
sive thus far, but the New Foundland
troops have distinguished themselves,
according to reports from British
headquarters.
The New Foundland battalion was
pushed up in what may be called the
third wave In the attack on probably
the most formidable section of the
whole Somme front through an al
most overwhelming artillery Are and
across ground swept by machine gun
nre from hidden posts, said one dis

On tho eastern front the operations

forces and bringing up artillery along
the Stoched river for a renewal of
heavy fighting.*,

[By Ed. Li. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
I/DNDON, July IS.—Great Britain
acted on strictly legal principles
when she abandoned the Declaration
of London as a code regulating
blockade and rights of neutrals and
belligerents at sea, Lord Robert Cecil,
minister of blockade, told the United
Press in an exclusive interview to
day.
The British minister answered sev
eral assertions made by the German
chancellor in a recent statement re
garding the Declaration of London.
"Apparently the chancellor regards
the Declaration of London as a char
ter of freedom of the seas," said
Lord Robert.
"What are the true facts? The
Declaration of London was merely a
code endeavoring to reconcile cer
tain contradictory theories of interna
tional law. It specifically permitted
the destruction of neutral prizes. It
did not repeal the well established
rights of belligerents against enemy
commerce.
"The chancellor maintains that the
declaration laW down the principle
that wars should be conducted solely
on land or before the actual ports of
the enemy. This is quite untrue.
There was no waiver of the right of
a belligerent to exercise on the high
seas the right he possesses under
international law.
"It is strange the Germans should
put forward their present contention
in view of the action of British
commerce destroying cruisers, such
as the Emden, Carlsrufie and Eitel
Friedrich, which during the early
months of the war sank many allied
and neutral vessels In places far re
moved from the port of any belliger
ent. Their action was not based up
on the ground of reprisals, but was
exercised by virtue of what they con
sidered 'belligerent rights. Moreover
the Germans at the outset of the war
sowed mines indiscriminately on
trade routes on the high seas.
"The chancellor accuses Great Brit
ain of lack of good faith In not adopt
ing the declaration. He apparently
has forgotten that the United States
government as early as 1913 recog
nized that the declaration was not
binding without express agreement
by the belligerents. The declaration
had in fact no binding force at all in
law, as it had not been ratified by
any of the signatories, and Indeed
had been repudiated by one chamber
of the British parliament. It was in
this respect very different trom the
treaty guaranteeing the neutrality of
Belgium, which was absolutely bind
ing upon the signatories, but which
Germany callously violated the mom
ent war broke out, following this act
by waging a land and sea warfare
with methods both oontrary to Inter
national law and repugnant to ideas
of civilization and humanity. I need

[By Henry Wood. Utalted Press Staff
Correspondent
PARIS, July 18.—Dense German
masses are storming the approaches
to Fort Souvllle in the seventh great
aarault on Verdun since the battle for
th" fortress 'began 146 days ago.
The violence of yesterday's attacks
furnish unmistakable evldenoe that
Germany is determined to continue
the attack on Verdun, regardless of
her critical position on olher fronts.
French military critics agreed on this
point today after studying the reports
from headquarters.
The present attack began Tuesday.
The Germans had spent eighteen days
in preparation. They brought up new
guns and trench mortars, shifted
more troops from the west bank of
the Meuse and hurried fr-jsh. supplies
of ammunition to the Souvllle-Dam
loup sector.
The French, ready to meet the
shock, turned loose a sheeted fire Into
the advancing German ranks and took
terrible toll with the "76's." Through
out Tuesday night and all day yester
day the battle raged an the Souvllle
Damloup sector, the Trench counter
attacking-with great spirit-
Only at one point near the Inter
section of the Fleury and Vaux roads,
did the German attack gain any
ground.
The Germans kept up a violent
bombardment throughout the night on
the sector of Souvllle and Chenois
and Laufee, but made no Infantry at
tacks, the war office announced today.

that the man-eater had added two vlo
