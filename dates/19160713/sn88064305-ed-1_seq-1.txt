SENTO DELO ft. JOHNSON.~ -P?_.
Hon. Delos R. Johnson made a
record in the assembly this ses
sion which would bring credit
to any District and the people of
Washington Parish feel proud of
our Senator.
'--Mr. Johnson is not an extrem
ist nor a fanatic, but possessing
a good judgment backed by the
power to accomplish things, he
wpas able to put through some of
the best legislation of this ses
sion, and today he is recognized
all over the state as one of the
strongest factors in the state.
The one act of the legislature
which brings relief to all the dry
territory in this state, compris
ing more than three-fifths of the
State in territory and nearly 60
per cent in population, is the
"Near Beer" bill by Senator
Johnson. When it was intro
duced the measure had few
friends in the Senate but after a
hard fight, the Senate finally
adopted it by a margin of one
vote. All the liquor interests in
the State and out of the State
used every means possible to
defeat it. This act prohibits'the
sale of malt liquors of any kind
in dry territory. The Near Beer
Saloon is dead.
Our Senator introduced and
secured the passage of three acts
in the interest of the farmers
and dairymen, One of them per.
mtits the farmer to sell his pro
duce, including meat raised on
the farm, in any quantities di
rect to the consumer without
having to pay any license or any
inspection fees. No matter what
sort of laws any town or city
may have now, any farmer can
sell anything he raises without
being interfered with at all. An
other permits the dairymen to
sell his produce without paying
any inspection fees. The third
fixes the manner in which stand
ards for farm products may be
fixed. This is very important in
the strawberry section.
Mr. Johnson also introduced
and secured the passage of the
Act reorganizing the State Board
of Education making it an over
lapping board and taking it out
of political control. This meas
ure also provides that all general
school funds must be distributed
by the Parish School Boards so
as to run every school in the
parish the same number of days,
giving the small school the same
benefits from these funds that is
received by the large schools.
Of course this does not apply to
funds firom special taxes. An
other important Act introduced
hy him and passed places the
deaf and dumb institute and the
institute for the blind under the
state board of education, remov
ing them from the influence of
loc(Ial polit.iCs in Rat. n Rouee.
He is also the autlior of the eon
stitutijnal amendment authoriz
!ng women Lo serve on educa
tional boards and hospital and
asylum boards in this state.
Louisiana is almost the last sthte
in the Union to recognize thi;s
right for her women.
Senator Johnson's influence in
the Senate gave the City of Ne.v
OI)rleans a Ion-rolitical Pubhli
Utilities 13uard and his amend
ment to that effect euded a lone

When the bil's came up which
provided the issuance of $20,000,
000 of bonds to build trunk high
ways in this state, carrying with
it the levy of a three mill tax for
forty years, Senator Johnson
was the first man in the legisla
ture and the only man in the
Senate to raise his voice in pro
test. He introduced a resolution
to delay action on these bills,
which he finally had passed.
Had the measures gone throutgh
it meant a $20.000,000 debt forn
40 years, the interest on whic
would have cost the taxpayers
over $1,000,000 per year. Under
our present assessment Wash
ington Parish's part of this debt
would have amounted to $500,
000.
No man in the legistature
worked harder or represented
his constituents with more ener

and the results are all that we
can ask.
