WILLIAM R. ROBERTSON

Presiding Judge op the Spring
field Court op Appevls.
Candidate for re-election, subject to
Democratic Primary.
After I was elected four years ago,
it was necessary under the law to cast
lots for the terms ot four, eight and
twelve years. I drew the short one,
Bnd now ask the privilege of making
the race for a regular term of twelve
years.
I have not asked for formal indorse
ments of lawyers and conventions I
have been discharging the duties of my
office. The Democrats in general make
the nomination. My record and repu
tation are open before you. 'If you
do not know about them ask thoBe
who do. The lawyers of my own
County and of the district are my
friends. Adv. .
Tells How to get Rid of Fly Pests.
Swarms of filthy pestilonce bearing
flies ar8 with-us. again in such num
bers aB to make life miserable. How
can wo get rid of them? According
to L. R. Haseman of the department
of entomology of the University of
Missouri at Columbia, to free our
selves from these unwelcome in
truders, stables ehonld be cleaned out.
and manure and othor rotting materials
scattered in tho use of baits, traps,
tangle foot and swatters. A few drops
of tornialdehide in a plate of milk
placed out of reach of children is an
excellent poison bait. '
On the farm a tight nail keg or
barrel can be used a9 a convenient fly
trap, by cutting out a circular open
- jug in the bottom to receive a wire
cone and by removing the top and
screening it so as to furnish light above
toward which the flies are attracted
when they enter the cone below. For
further light make holes in the sides,
carefully screening them. When the
trap is prepared stand it on four
bricks where the flics are most abund
ant s.nd place a dish of attractive bait
directly underneath the wire funnel.
The flies on leaving the dish of bait
will rise into the mouth of the cone
and be carried up into the trap. As
further relief from the pests, keep
the doors and windows screened and
screens closed.
Carrying of germs by houaeflies
may sometimes be exaggerated, but
the importance of preventing flies
cannot be overestimated. You can
never know when you may eat food
on which flies have scattered typhoid
serins. "Safety First" with this
speedy messenger of disease and
death. ,
Shade Trees Shouid not be Butchered in
Pruning-
Thare is a right and wrong way of
pruning fihHde trees just as there is a
right and wrong way of pruning fruit
trees. H. F- Major of the Missouri
College of Agriculture has prepared
circular which illustrates the exact
ways in which the common shade
tcees should be pruned. The reasons
for pruning shade trees are to remove
dead wood, to take out crowding
branches, to increase the bulbs that
produce flower?, and to 'balance up1
jthe tree.
Circular 81 Pruning Shade Trees
Is available for free distribution to the
cittisens of Missouri who want to
prnne their shade trees in such a
wav as to U!flke them more beautiful
and preserve them without destroying
their eltecuveness tor a year or iwo
After the pruning. Anycffe can easily
follow the simple directions .nd illus
trations given and prune their own
trees according to the methods follow
ed by the leading landscape architects
fit the country. .

The Rolla Scbool of Mines Wins Out.
fWest Plains Gazette.)
The Supreme Court en banc Mon
day afternoon in an opinion by Judge
James T. Blair, sustained the valid
ity of the Buford act passed by the
last general assembly, enlarging the
scope of the State School of Mines at
Rolls, by authorizing it to confer
degrees In civil, mechanical and elec
trical engineering in addition to con
ferring degrees in mining engineer
ing. The law was fought by the board
of curators of the State University
and the friends of that institution on
the grounds that it was destined to
cripple the university.
Judge Blair holds that the legis
lature has the right, if it sees fit, to
pass enactments prescribing a course
of study and a writ is ordered issued
requiring the curators to establish the
curriculum called .for in the Buford
act. v
This is a great victory for the friends
of the School of Mines. The curators
of the State University at one time
sought to move from Rolla the class
that now are taught in the School of
Mines and teach them at Columbia. It
was-planned to use the building at
Rolla for an industrial school. Rolla
citizens who have always pointed
with pride to their wonderful scbool
did not take to this idea and the re
sult was that the legislature conferred
more powers upon the School of
Mines, from which the State Univer
sity appealed to the Supreme Court
and lost out. It was a great victory
for Rolla and her excellent state institution.
After Three Years
Ironton Testimony Remains Unshaken.
Time is the best tes,t of truth.
Here is an Ironton story that has stood
the test of time. It is a story with a
point which will come straight home
to many of us.
Anderson Rust, Ironton, says: "I
was badly in need of something to re
lieve me of lameness in my back. My
kidneys were frequently too active,
especially at night and sometimes the
passages of the kidney secretions were
accompanied by pain. Short use of
Doan's Kidney "Pills, procured at the
Arcadia Valley Drug Co., cured me.g
Over three years later, Mr. Rust
said; "I haven't had any return of
kidney complaint sinoe Doan's Kidney
Pills cured me." , "

simply ak for a kidney remedy get
