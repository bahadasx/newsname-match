of Life on the Border : f

I raised my hands.
There was no word spoken. The re
volver and behind it the masked face
jif the highwayman were enough.
For the first time in my life I real
ized how people felt when they gazed
at the muzzle of my gun and trembled
before the black mask that 1 wore.
I remember that I wanted to laugh.
The humorous side of the situation ap
pealed to mo. I was being held up!
I, Hugh Richmond, whose purse did
not contain so much as the value of
one gold piece, but whose body, dead
or alive, .was worth $5,000.
I know that I smiled, and I could see
that my smile was disconcerting; there
fore I knew that l was face to face
with an amateur. I cared little for be
ing held Up. In fact. 1 rather enjoyed
the situation.
"Pleasant day," I ventured.
The gun made a terrific report, ami
the bullet whizzed dangerously close.
After such an answer I kept my lips
closed.
My highwayman did not seem to
know what to do next, and we sat on
our horses at a bend in the mountain
road and looked at each other. The
first motion lie made I knew that be
wanted me to dismount, hut l pretend
od not to understand and wrinkled my
brow as though puzzled.
"Climb off." came in a faint whisper.
Then I was puzzled. It was not the
hoarse whisper of one who had lost his
voice. Of a sudden I understood. My
amateur highwayman was more fright
ened than his victim. He could not
even manage his voice. I determined
to take advantage of him.
In those days I was a good horseman,
and I was mounted on the wisest little
mare that ever kicked up (lust in a
sheriff's face.
Gently 1 touched Dolly's flank with a
spur and, keeping my hands aloft,
made her plunge from side to side,
guiding her with my knees until we
were several yards away.
I lowered my hands, leaned forward,
chirped In Dolly's ear, and away we
flow.
Bang, bang, bang! All of bis shots
went wild.
An hour later I smiled to myself and
tried to Imagine the astonishment that
would seize Mr. Amateur if lie knew
that his revolver had caused Hugh
Richmond to lift his hands.
There wasn't a sheriff in Colorado
that didn't want me. I was wanted on
so many charges that I had lost track
of them myself.
I only knew that no man—"no, nor
woman either, though by your smile"
—was my friend.
I sprawled in the sunshine, as I often
did. and let my thoughts wander.
At such times I would think of the
faces of men and women I had known
long ago, and of all those faces there
was but one I remembered with ten
derness, and that dear, sweet little girl
believed that 1 was dead.
believed that 1 was dead.
I was worse. Society had driven me
out.
Solitude is pleasant enough when you
grow tired of the city and are wearied
by the restless clatter of industry, but
I longed—I actually craved the coin
pany of a human being.
But I could have no friends. I knew
if I made any sooner or later 1 would be

THE nUMOKQUS SIDE OF THE SITUATION
APPEALED TO ME. I WAS BEING HELD UP !
betrayed, and the horror of horrors
that oppressed my mind was that I
might be taken alive.
From where 1 was it was not far to
Binon, and in Binon— well, there were
people—a dance hxll, music, the clatter
of voices and the sound of oaths, a
ghastly resemblance of a pleasurable
life that I had known long ago and in
another section of the world.
It was quiet in the Silver Dollar
when I rode up. casually glanced at
the men in front of the saloon and en
tered. There were only two or three
people in the place. To sit in that ho!
saloon, reeking with odors that at otb
er times would have been offensive,
was now a pleasure.
At such a place you meet and see
many kinds of people—the vicious and
the good gone wrong, who incidentally
make up the great percentage of the
outcast element; the bad and would
like to he bad, the braggart and the
hero, faro dealers, rough handed min
ers and disjointed cowboys.
An hour after I sat down a young
man with lily hands entered. I knew
him for a gambler or a tenderfoot, and
when he placed himself before the tin
pan piano and began banging a selec
tion from "li Trovatore" 1 knew that
he was a newcomer and shifted my
chair to get a good look at his face. He
was a handsome lad. one of the poetic
type.
"Dey," I shouted softly and in ridi
cule, "desist from such atrocities."
lie looked at me in amazement..
"You know that piece—you—you!"
And his last word had an altogether
different inflection. lie was startled
and from saucer like eyes stared at me.
My first thought was that 1 had been
trapped; that lie recognized me as Hugh
Richmond.
"What's the matter?" 1 demanded.
No answer.
"Tell me. \Vh::t is the matter?"
There was a ring iti my voice that he
did not disregard, and he answered In
a whisper. "Nothing."
That whisper! He was the amateur
highwayman.
We had met again, and I liked the
boy. My impressions are not always
correct, but they are positive, and if I
take a dislike to a man at first si'^lit I
would distrust him though we were
seated side by side in heaven.
But this lad, this mere youth, this un
sophisticated child of the east, who
had no better sense than to attempt
highway robbery and three hours later
inflict music on his victim, touched my
sympathy.
"Weil?" I spoke half defiantly be
cause I wanted to make him talk.
"We never met before," lie stam
mered, coming toward me with the re
luctance of one approaching a judg
ment seat.
"Never," I answered emphatically.
As he sat down I pushed the bottle
toward him, and he grasped it eagerly.
"Good stuff," he lied politely.
"Damnable," I rejoined.
"But I think it is good," he insisted
and took another glass of the liquid fire.
"How long?"
"Three weeks," he replied, embar
rassed "I nin a tenderfoot, the rawest
kind and well blistered."
"How long?" I queried again.
"God knows. 1 don't want to stay
any longer than I can help."
His tongue had been loosened. Three
large jolts of whisky—such whisky as
comes over the bar of the Silver Dollar
would have loosened the tongue of the
Sphinx—and before 1 realized what
was happening he was rapidly whis
pering into my ears his tale of sorrow.
"I was in a social set that was too
high for my purse," he said. "My fam
ily was proud, my name was an open
sesame to (he exclusive set, but my in
come was small. My employer trusted
me. There is a woman in the case.
"Heaven, such a woman! I am not
worthy of her. It was not her fault.
And 1 wish that I could get a start
over again, hut I've hit the trail for
hell, and yet she loves me. I couldn't
let her know that 1 was poor, and I
showered iier with presents, just os
the other follows did that wanted her
to love them, but she turned them away.
•'She loved me, do you hear? 1 gave
her everything that money could buy,
and then the crash came.
"My own father turned me out of the
house. My own mother wouldn't let
mo kiss her good by. My employer—lie
was nn old friend of the family—said
he woifldu't prosecute, but I was dis
graced. The papers bad it.
"And then she—she of all women—
said that she loved me and always
would and said that she was as much
to blame os I because she had allowed
mi? to spend money on flowers and take
her to the theater—most of the money
went for that; but, of course, there was
a ring.
"She told me to go west, to go out
where money was dug from the ground
and fortunes made in a day and to get
enough to settle my accounts, and then
we would go to some place else and
begin life all over again.
"And here I am. But what can I
do? How can I dig gold out of the
ground? I know nothing about it
There's nothing I can do. I'm bad
had ull the way through. My father
told mo I was. So what's the use? 1
don't care for myself, but for her—for
her.'*
Tears rose in his eyes, and he cried;
"if I could only get a start again for
her! I'd slave my life away just to
make her happy, for she loves me even
after all that."
lie drew a small picture from his
pocket, kissed it again and again, then
laid it on the tabic and gazed intently
at the sweet, childish face.
I glanced at the picture casually,
rose, gripped the table, then sank Pack,
staring into the face of the boy. who
failed to notice. I knew her—oh, how
well I knew her! And all that lie said
was true. I glanced around tile saloon.
It was early. Men were just beginning
to drop in. There we sat. the boy and
I, men from the far. far east, and each
had been driven out, he as the result of
a faithlessness to a trust and I—no
matter why I came.
There we sat together, he a youth
and I a man. and before ns lay the pic
ture of a woman whom we both loved.
The boy had fallen across his arms
on Hie tab*?. At first he sighed, and
then his heavy breathing told me that
fie was sleeping. I fell into a reverie.
I itad no money. All that I could get
hold of went east, passed through the
hands of a lawyer and then to— But
she never knew whence it came. She
believed what the lawyer told her. anil
he didn't know the truth.
Still the hoy slept
I

I speculated on the amount he needed
and glanced about the room. I touched
him on the shoulder. No answer. 1
shook him. aud lie raised his head
drowsily.
"How much do you need?"
He was not fully awake.
"Come on; wake up." And I shook
him again.
"What do you want?"
"Come on outside. The fresh air will
do you good," I said.
We went out.
"Look here, laddie, I came out west
several years ago and struck it rich.
I like you, and I know that there is not
a streak of bad in you. Now, it' I lend
you the money will you go hack and be
a man? When you get on your feet
you can pay it back; no hurry, though."
"Would I—would I? Oh, heavens!
Then I could go hack like a mau and
Ik? a man. You must be nn angel in
disguise!"
"Have you a horse here?"
"No."
"Well, take mine—over there." I
selected the liest one in sight—that is,
next to Dolly. Explanations at that
stage of the game would have been
embarrassing.
Then I gave him directions as to
how to ride, aud told him' to make
haste.
"I'll be along pretty soon—in about
an hour—but I want you to go now.
I will have to go back and find a
couple of friends and borrow a few

dollars to make up the amount. I
couid get it tomorrow, but I want to
see you started back east tomorrow
morning. it will be a long ride, but
I guess you are good for it, even if you
are a tenderfoot."
He wanted to wait and come with
me, but I made him ride off.
Then I went back in. It was a risky
proposition, and such a desperate
chance that even now I have strange
twitching about my heart when I think
of it
There were noise and laughter. The
tin pan piano was going its utmost; ex
cited gamblers were plunging heavily
at faro bank, and several men were
at tlie bar. when I placed my back to
at tlie bar. when I placed my back to
the wall, drew both guns instantly and
roared;
"Hands up!"
The confusion became silence.
Some turned to the door.'bent on
taking a chance, but thought better of
it, and up went their hands. The bar
tender hesitated for a moment, debat
ing whether or not to drop behind the
bar, but he caught my eye and obeyed.
In less time than it takes to tell I
had plundered the faro bank—and a
goodly roll it was—and asked the bar
tender to step aside while l emptied
the till. He gave me a smile, and l
knew by that smile that lie was a dan
gerous man.
I backed to tbo door, knowing that
the moment I stepped outside a fusil
lade of shots would Ik? sent in my di
rection. I turned, made two jumps
and was astride of Dolly and pounding
down the road while the wicked crack
of a Winchester troubled my ears. I
glanced over my shoulder and could
see the white apron about the shadowy
form that stood in the doorway. The
bartender was a dangerous man. but I
had boon born under a lucky star.
"What's all that shooting about?"
the bo.v asked when I overtook him a
couple of 'miles farther on.
"A little altercation over a poker
game. Come on; we'll have to ride
fast if we make that station in time to
catch the morning train."
After pushing our horses hard and
talking but little we arrived at the sta
tion the following morning just ns the
train whistled in the distance. Its faint
roar grew nearer and nearer until,
with a mighty rush, it was upon us
and the brakes were grinding and
creaking.
"If I only knew how I could repay
you—I will, but I would like to express
my thanks now. and words won't do
it," he said earnestly as he gripped mv
hand.
"You can—and fully—for all time."
"IIow? Tell me how. 1 will do any
thing."
"Give mo that picture of"— and 1
called the sweet faced girl by name.
He reached in his pocket and handed
it to me. Again we shook hands. He
stepped on the train, and slowly it
moved off. and then faster and faster
until it was out of sight.
I stood staring after the train and
wondering what lie would think when
he remembered that he had never told
me her name—for she was my daugh
ter.
THE EMERALD ISLE
In Area It Is a Little Smaller Than
Our State of Maine.
ITS SLUMP IN POPULATION.
One of the Few Sections of the Civi
lized World That Have Decreased In
Numbers In the Past Century—Its
Beautiful Lakes and Rivers.
The historical and political impor
tance of Ireland has created in the
minds of many Americans an exagger
ated idea of the island's physical pro
portions and the density of its popula
tion.
The whole of Ireland embraces an
area slightly less than the state of
Maine, hut with a population six times
as dense. In comparison with the gov
erning country it is three-fifths as large
as England and Wales, with one-ninth
the population. The island is one of
the very few sections of the civilized
world where the population has shown
a marked decrease during the last cen
tury.
The first census of the Island, taken
in 1821, recorded a population almost
50 per cent larger than at the present
time, while the census of 1841 showed
the high water mark of more than
8,000,000, nearly twice the present pop
ulation. This remarkable decrease, due
largely to emigration, began after the
famine brought about by the destruc
tive disease which attacked the potato
crop of 1845. Tlii3 calamity resulted
in the withdrawal of more than a mil
lion acres from cultivation within two
years.
Incidentally the potato, which has
played such an Important role in the
life of Ireland during the last 300
years, is not indigenous to the island,
but was one of the food gold mines
discovered by the Spaniards in their
conquest of Beru. The country is in
debted to Sir Walter Raleigh for her
•'Irish'' potatoes, as it was he who
brought them from what is now North
Carolina and planted them on his es
tate near Cork in 15S5.
Ireland lies on the western rim of
what was once a part of continental
Europe. It has numerous mountains,
the highest being the McGillieuddy
reeks (3,414 feet) in the Killnruey re
gion, but there is no mountain chain or
elevated "backbone." There is a more
or less well defined plain, however, the
distinguishing feature of which is its
bogs—the black hog producing the fa
mous peat fuel, differentiated from the
brown bogs of the mountains. If the
whole island were brought to a mean
level it would rise 400 feet above the
sea.
The lakes, or loughs, of Ireland are
among its most widely appreciated
physical characteristics, their scenic
beauty being the inspiration of poets,
painters and musicians. Nor have the
Irish rivers been overlooked in ap
praisals of the island's beauties. The
Shannon, which flows for 250 miles,
is the longest water course in the Unit
ed Kingdom. It is navigated by large
steamers for half its length and is con
nected with Dublin by means of the
Grand and the Royal canals.
Although coal is found in most of the
thirty-two counties
most the
thirty-two counties into which the is
land is divided aud there is consider
able iron ore, mining is not an impor
tant industry. Gold was being mined
in a modest way in County Wicklow at
the time of the rebellion of 1798. but
the works were destroyed and the
source of the metal has never been re
discovered.
Agriculture and stock raising are the
chief occupations of the inhabitants.
At one time the woolen manufactures
of the islaud were formidable rivals of
English factories, but hostile legisla
tion gave the industry a check from
which it has never recovered. As the
Irish have raised flax for centuries,
the manufacture of linen early became
one of the important industries of the
country. Irish whisky is an important
article of export, and one of the largest
breweries in the world is located at
Dublin.
Shipbuilding in the great yards at
Belfast is one of the most widely
known Irish activities, and the deep
sea and coast fisheries afford a liveli
hood for many thousands.
Thanks to the temperate influence of
the west winds from the Atlantic, the
thermometer rarely reaches freezing
point in winter, while the average for
a summer day is GO degrees.
At Torr Head on the north the dis
tance to Scotland (Mull of Cnntire) is
only thirteeu and one-lialf miles. The
Giant's Causeway, a short distance to
the east of this point, is the outcrop
ping basaltic formation which in a
former age joined the two islands.—

Musio In Shakespeare's Time.
Shakespeare's time was an age of
music. "Catches" were sung by gen

Lute, cithern or virginals were in ev
ery barber's shop for the diversion of
customers. * * * Thomas Morley may
be using the blessed argument of a
music teacher when he tells us that a
gentleman was counted but n boor If
he could not play the lute or sing a
part In n madrigal, but there is no get
ting over the craggy fact that over
eighty collections of madrigals, ayres
aud songs were printed and published
between 1587 and 1030, in addition to
which vast collections of early music
still remain in manuscript. With an
aristocracy fond of music and accus
tomed to play and listen to music and
song, music in the theater was almost
is inevitable in England as in Italy,
says the London Musical Record. It
was considered a manly accomplish
ment to play the hunting horn. Every
gentleman who kept hounds could wlud
it. A punctilious etiquette fixed the
correct set of notes for each operation
of the chase. Usually a play had at
least one song.
Fish Exhibit Emotions.
We are accustomed to think that
only we humans become pallid with
fear or agitated with joy, but some ex
periments with perch in the artificial
pond show that when their repose is
suddenly disturbed by tapping on the
glass the fish visibly tremble, and the
bars which are characteristic of this
siècles actually disappear for the time
being, only to reappear when the dis
turbance Ls removed and the equanim
ity of the fish Is restored.
Sometimes a pike that is rapidly ad
vancing on his prey becomes suspicious
about the latter's character. The pur
suer will suddenly stop in an attitude
of doubt, his back will arch, and he
will remain suspended as though
studying the cause of Ids suspicions.
Only when he is thoroughly reassured
does he become rigid, to advance to the
final attack; if his suspicion is not al
layed he drops to the bottom of the
pond or swims off in disappointment.—

Success.
"One night at Lady .leune's house
Joseph Chamberlain said to me that
he believed any man of even moderate
endowment could attain any given aim
which he set before him with unre
mitting effort and 'enduring to the
end.' To my question, 'Why, Mien, do
so many men fall short of their ambi
tions?' he answered: 'They come to the
place where they turn back. They
may have killed the dragon at the first
bridge and at the second, perhaps even
at the third. B.ut the dragons are al
ways more formidable tlie farther we
go. Many turn back disheartened, and
very few will meet the monsters to
the end. Almost none is willing to
have a try with the demon at the last
bridge, but if he does he lias won for
ever.' rrincess Lazarovkh in Cen
tury.
"I Love You."
Very Interesting mo the phrases used
by the various people of the world to
express "I love you." Wherever there
are human beings declarations of love
are made, and there are a thousand
languages in which the tender passion
may be expressed. The Chinese say
"Uo ugai nl," the Armenian expresses
his love with "Se siren as hez," the
Arab is content with tlie short "Ne
habbek," while the Turk murmurs
"Sidi seveiorum." In Iftdia "Main
syne ka pisar karim" is the declara
tion. But the Greenlander holds the
palm for the word love. When he does
not stammer it has fifteen syllables and
has been recorded phonetically thus:
"Unifgraeerndlainalerfironajunguurrig

The Cutlers' company had probably
existed long before the grant of the

corded between the Cutlers and the

ing them with unworkmanlike sheaths
for knives, daggers and swords, to
which the Sbeathers cruelly retorted
that the Cutlers disgraced the sheaths
by selling Inferior foreign blades foe
