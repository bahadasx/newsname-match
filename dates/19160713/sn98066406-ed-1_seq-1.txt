ELECTRIC RAILROAD.
Detroit, Armada, Yale, Harbor Beach
Railroad Assuming Tangible Yorm
On Saturday laat a representative
from the Expositor olllce called on Mr.
Jacobson, the man at the head of the
organization that is promoting the pro
posed railroad from Detroit up into the
Thumb dietrict with a view to ascer
taining what the present ' status
of the road was. Mr. Jacobson was
then engaged with his counsel in per
fecting the legal formalities connected
with the enterprise preparatory to sub
mining tho proposition to the Itailroad
Commission at Lansing, in order to get
the btate s approval of the enterprise.
Mr. Jaoobnou explained to the writer
that all arrangements had been made
to dispose of the securities, juat as soon
ad they had been approved ny the state
otlicials, which would be within the
present month. Jutt -as soon as this
was done, they would be ready to take
up the matter of securing trie right of
way for the road and such- bonuses as
the different places benefitted' by the
road were willing to contribute.
In regard to the matter of - bonuses,
Mr. Jacobson explained that . under
Ftrasent conditions, it was practically
mpossible to build a railroad without
them; that statistics show that there
was less railroad built in the United
States last year than during any year
since tne civil war. This is due to the
fact that in Michigan and nearly all of
the other states of the union, so-called
"Ulue Sky" laws have been enacted
which require all such euterprires to be
approved by the state before any stocks
or bonds can be placed upon the mar
ket and that the state is so strict in its
enforcement of this law that it is im-
fiOBsible to adequately provide for the
mtial expense of organizing these
propositions, and in order to make these
enterprises such that any man, or group
of men, with organizing ability to
take hold of them, it is absolutely
necessary to secure from the different
places benefitted, a substantial bonus;
that without it the road could not be
built.
Now, we have talked with business
men from Marlette, which is a town
substantially as large as we are, and up
to a short time ago was considered as
good a town, commercially speaking,
and they have uniformally told us that,
due to the fact that the Handy Bros,
road had cut them off on the north and
east, their business is "on the hummer"
and that unless they get an extension
of the D. U. K. from lmlay City, which
they hope to get in the near future,
their town is doomed. We are 60 situ
ated, that to our mind, Marlette is an
exact parallel with us, and what the
Handy Bros, road has done to them it
surely will do to us. It isn't a question
as to whether we accept or reject a
proposed improvement, it is a question
Of WHKTHEH OK NOT WK8TAY ON TUB
map commercially,
We must not be in the position of the
fellow who bought a lock for the barn
after the horse was stolen but we must
take time by the forelock and prepare
ior tni8 contingency (and we feel that
we may properly say calamity) by put
ting our shoulder to the wheel and
raise the bonus asked by these men.
we can do it, and it is up to us. When
it Is a question of such vital importance
to us, we can well afford to be liberal
because in this case contribution is. in
our opinion, just as necessary as medi
cine tor a sick man. We Are not sick
yet but let us play safe and take the
anti-toxin now and save ourselves a
great sick spell later.
ihese gentlemen who are behind this
proposition, will be among us again
shortly and we trust when they do
come our citizens will be in a frame of
mind which will produce some results.

YALE INVITES YOU
We Are Planning on the Biggest
Crowd and the Best Time Our
People Ever Had
If the weather man only holds his
heel down and gives us a decent day
we will have' a mammoth erowd for
the big Caledonian Day, on Tuesday,
July 25th. The neighboring towns
which were visited this week promise
us big crowds.
As one of the biggest attractions of
the day. Gladys Combers, champion
dancer and foremost girl piper of the
Dominion will be here, and this feature
alone is worth coming milea to hear
and see.
Gladys and Isabell MacGregor, of
Sarnia. and Marion Stark, of London
a trio of the best dancers obtainable
have also been engaged.
George H. Bridekirk and Robert
Brown, with Miss Comber, will liven
up the occasion with the bagpipes, and
there will be lots or good old scotch
music during the day.
The athletic games as printed in
another column will be carried out
and the purses which are hung up for
every event will surely bring us in
crowd of outside athletes.
The base ball game between the
Yale Boosters and the Sandusky teams
will surely be a fast one as both of the
teams are out to win.
The committee has completed ar
rangements with the Lexington band
to come over and help with the cele
bration. This band is bo well known
In Y'ale and vicinity that it is not
necessary for us to say more than that
thev are coming. This attraction In
addition to the pipers will give neaps
of music for the crowd.
This part of the day's program will
be carried out in our beautiful city
ark. Y'ou will 'find plenty of shade
n the park and we invite you to come
with your baskets and maxe this a reg
ular picnic day.
But hoot mon: Have you taken ad
vantage of the advance sale of tiokets
for the Scotch concert in Central hall
In the evening at 70) o'elock sharp?
A real old-time program will be pulled
off. These tickets can be secured at
Y'ale State Bank, Glenn Daykln's, Pred
Taylor's,- Expositor otnee or C. S.
Cochrane's. Admission to the concert
is 25c. Reserved seats will be on sale
next ' Monday evening at Hennessy's
d nig store.
Blue Ribbon Races
What promises to be the greatest
racing in the history of the trotting
turf will be seen during the thirty
second aanual Blue Ribbon meeting
of the Detroit Driving Club at the
state fair grounds, July 24 to 29. 1o
insure contests in every mile the racing
will be on the three-beat plan, in other
words, every beat is a separate race.
This will eliminate the laying-up or
waiting until the pace-makers are ex
hausted. The only way a horse can win
is to be among the first four In every
heat and there will be just three heats
to every race.
So popular is this system with the
horsemen of the country that the entry
in the fixtures exceeds that of any
other year, and the final payment finds
a larger number of eliglbles than in the
past.
The Merchants' A Manufacturers'
stake, of $10,000 is unusually attractive
for one of the lot has shown a 2:03 abil
ity and half a dozen are better than
2:05 trotters, so the record for the stake
is certain to be lowered if conditions
are favorable.
In the Board of Commerce stake of
$5,0000 for 21)6 pasers are at least ten
that can pace in 2:04 or better and one
that has been In 2:02.
' The same speed characterizes all of
the events. On Monday, July 2i, there
are three purses for $1300 each. The
Board of Commerce stake is the Tues
day feature, three-year-olds also racing
that day. The M. & M. is set for Wed
nesday. Two stakes and a free-for-all
on Thursday and four fast purse events
for Friday.
Weber's band, the most famous or
ganization in the country, has been en
gaged for the week, and time between
heats will be filled with a musical pro
gram of superlative excellence.
Bailey-Smith Nuptials
Married at the home of Eva Black on
Thursday, July 6th, 1916, by Rev. L.
Clark, Mrs. Martha Bailey, of Port Hu
ron, and Mr. Samuel 11. Smith of Yale.

West Brockway and Mrs. Bailey is well
known and has many friends in that

happy wedded life.
