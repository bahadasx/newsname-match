After an absence of about seven
weeks Judge Crosby and children
Kent and Laprele reached home
last Friday. They were accom
pained by Mrs. Amelia Coleman
and Mrs. David Butler. They
made the trip in Mr. Crosby's
Ford car coming by way of Price
Moab and Monticello. Utah,
Cortez Colorado, and Shiprock
Agency and Gallup, New Mexi
co. Mrs. Crosby remained in Utah
with her daughter Lucile, "who is
ill at the L. D. S. hospital. The
doctors in charge of her case say
that they have good hopes for her
recovery.
Mr. Crosby says outside of the
sickness in his family the trip was
enjoyed by all of them.
Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy.
Every family without exception
should keep this preparation at
hand during the hot weather of
the summer months. Chamber
lain's Colic, Cholera and Diar
rhoea Remedy is worth - many
times its cost when needed and is
almost certain to be needed before
the summer is over. It has no
superior for ihe purposes for
which it is intended. Buy it now.
Obtainable eveiywheie. Adv.

Lost Adams Mine.
The article treating of the Lost
Adams Mine, which appeared in
the New Ihdustrial Era number
of the Gallup Independent last
March, has struck a cord which is
still vibrating in the minds and
hearts of the people. More than
one party has gone out in search
of the Treasure-trove since the
article appeared.
Captain John Samuel Jones who
supplied most of the data for the
article mentioned searched for the
Lost Adams Mine, at intervals
through a period of ten years and
spent considerable money in the
search. Since his last trip sev
eral years ago, he has obtained
additional information,
from a
i nephew of one Laurenz, who was
, with the Adams party. Laurenz
j has since died. Jones knows
j more about the matter than any
other man living. He feels that
the chances ot finding the $300,
000.00 hidden treasure, are better
now than they have ever been.
He will agree to lead a small
secret party in a search for the
lost gold, for one-half the find,
and expenses for himself and an
assistant, while making the
search.
Such a trip for four persons
will not cost much money. Per
mision should be obtained from
the Commissioner of Indian af
fairs for the party to search in
the Navajo reservation, if neces
sary. The rainy season and the
autumn monhts are the best sea
sons for such a contemplated
search. No Penniless schemers
nor soldiers of fortune need apply.
