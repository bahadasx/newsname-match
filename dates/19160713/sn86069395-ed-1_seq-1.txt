EXPERIMENT FARM
MAY BE SECURED.
A movement has gained decided
impetus in the last few days which
purposes to secure a twenty aero ex
periment farm for Christian county,
similar to those located at Russellville !
and Madisonvillc. It" is thought that
the location of the farm will be at
Pembroke, if the move proves suc-i
cessful. The farm will bo used by the
r rtr. nml vu inn pminrv nrrrioill-
farmers, and by the county agricul
tural leaders in the interest, of the i
farmers.
The U. S. government will furnish
the equipment if the county can se
cure the land. In case of its discon
tinuance for agricultural experiment
work it would be deeded back to the
donors. Agriculturist Casey is de
lighted over the present prospects of
securing this farm for the county. It
would give the farmers an opportuni
ty to make experiments and try things
they would be unable to on their own
rods.

Private Willie Gresham Tells
About the Band and
Company D.
HAS FINISHED 4 YEARS
"Sweet Milk" Squad Formed
to Get Members Up to '
Weight.
Private Willie Gresham, of the
Third Regiment .Band, the first Hop
kinsville soldier to return from Fort
Thomas, arrived Wednesday morn
ing. Ho has served his full four
years' time and returned withan'hon
orable discharge from duty with
commendation for faithful service.
He said to a Kentuckian represent
ative yesterday:
"Both the band and Company D
are in fine shape. There is no sick
ness in the company. The band is
making the biggest hit of its life. Ev
erybody says its the best band at the
camp.
"The boys from Hopkinsville have
not been made to do raUch hard work
yet on account of the soreness in their
arms caused by the inoculation against
typhoid. The- third inoculation will
be taken this week and after the arms
heal the soldiers will be run through
pretty stiff work.
"The members of the band are
worrying a great deal over the physi
cal examination they will be made to
take in the next few days. Most of
the companies have had their exam
ination but the Third Regiment is
coming ktst. In.'.prder to fatten up
some of the members who arc not
quite up to the required weight Capt
Ben Vmfree, of the band, has started
what we .call at'sweetI milk squad."
The boys in it are Harry Boyd; Nel
son Long, Leslie Long, Lewis Clark,
Ruby Croft and Luthe'r Gresham.
They fed all of them on things to
make them fatten up for the examin
ation. "A funny thing to see is the fellows
who have grown mustaches. Trice
Waller, James Higgins, Elmer Ger
ard, Ruby Croft and Luther Gresliam
have all turned out little "Charley
Chaplin" moustaches. All the other
fellows have started trying to grow
them.
"We stayed in the barracks, had
single bed and were treated nicely.
We got all we could eat of army ra
tions, but it isn't like home eating.
I nearly ate myself to death at din
ner." DAWSON LEADS

days continuous fighting, cover a
front of nearly eight miles and In:
elude the entire German first system
of defenses, according to the official
report forwarded by Gen. Haig, the
British commaadcr in chief on the
French front. This advance includes
a number of small towns or villages
and positions which are considered of
great strategic importance.
Tho British advance extended into
the German positions for a depth of
2,000 to 4,000 yards. Many of the
villages were strongly fortified, the
woods were full of trenches and sur
rounded by barbed wire, and what
Gen. Haig describes as "immensely
strong redoubts," had to be carried
by storm.
At the same time the French army
under Gen. Foch has moved up in
the southern section of the Somme
until it now holds the dominating hills
around Peronne, a town which has
been strongly fortified by the Ger
mans and the possession of which
they are likely to contest with the ut
most determination.
FRENCH WAIT FOR BRITISH.
The French along the Somme car
ried out some minor detached opera
tions which enabled them to strengthen
their position at La Maisonnette and
apparently the French are waiting for
the British to straighten out their line
before making the attempt to drive,
the Germans out of Peronne. '
In this great battle about 22,000
prisoners have been taken by the
Franco-British forces, of whom Brit-

brought .up strong reinforcements and
artillery to oppose the Russians who
now are within 20 miles of Kovel.
The defences of this town are be
lieved to be powerful, although there
now are no natural barriers between
Gen. Brussiloff's army and its objec

a furious nature while the Russians
were crossing the river at various
points.

WILL ENFORCE
VAGRANCY LAW
Commissioners Order Police
to Keep Keen Lookout
For Loafers.
No more loafing!
The city commissioners met Tues
day morning and gave instructions to
the Chief of Police ordering the en
forcement of vthe vagrancy law.
Tho law, which was passed four
vpnrQ nrm nml c'tinit tli'il finio line nnf
been energetically enforced, is per?
fectly plain in its meaning and leaves
i no room for doubt about the punish
ment. It says that men not at work
or unable to show that they are at
work or why they should not work,
arc classed as vagrants.
It'was brought out at tiie meeting
of the commissioners that there is a
crying need for labor in the fields and
on the city streets. Jobs are open at
from $1.50 to $2.50 a day for laborers.
While farmers cannot get hands and
tlus city is unable to get workmen on
its roads, big, healthy, husky men
are loafing around public places and
living as parasites on the town.
Chfef Roper stated to a Kentuckian
reporter yesterday that every effort
would bo inado to enforce the law to
tho letter. For tho first offence, ho
Baid. ten days in jail would result,
and anybody who had a habit of loaf
ing would be more severely dealt

MEN IN MIND IN
HOPKINSVILLE
Prominent Factors in The
Busy Life of the Pearl
City.
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 96
Head of a New Firm in Hop-
kinsville's Oldest Dry
Goods Stand.
E. P. BARNES.
The Bible says you mustn't put new
wine in old bottles, but it does not
say-it is not wise to put new firms in
old stands when for any reason the
lapse of time brings about changes in
business.
Hopkinsville has one notable busi
ness corner that has always been de
voted to (he Cry goods trade. Few
if any people in Hopkinsville can re
member vhen the northwest coiner of
Main and Seventh streets was not one
of the city's 1 .nl't'y stores. Fifty
years aco the - Lite Luuiat Jones laid
- TIL
the foundation of a great fortune in its
walls and ntier his death hrFbrbther,
T. M. Jonos, continued the business
for more t iaa 20 years, until he chose
to retire iv'iout a year ago. In a few
weeks a -brand new firm of dry goods
men leasee, the familiar corner and
resumed the same line of business in
the Jones building. The firm of
Barnes & Metcalfe came unheralded
from a neighboring town, but it did
not take them long to demonstrate
that they were just the character of
citizens that Hopkinsville is always
glad to welcome. They soon made a
place for themselves in dry goods cir
cles and by hustle and energy and
straight dealing have made themselves
fixtures and both partners have mov
ed their families to the city, though
having extensive interests elsewhere.
E. P. Barnes, the head of the firm,
spends much of his time looking after
his other stores. These are E. P.
Barnes & Bra, at Beaver Dam, Ky,
The Barnes .Mercantile Co., at Cen
tral City, and the Barnes Store, In
corporated, at Earlington.
E. P. Barnes was born on a farm
Jan. 27, 18GG, in Ohio county, Ky.,
and began clerking in a store at Beav
er Dam when 18 years old. Ho sav
ed his small earnings, received fre
quent promotions and in four years
bought an interest in the store. In
due time he owned it all. Ten
years ago he
established the store at
Central City. In 1008 he opened the
one at Earlington and a year ago mov
ed to tho larger field here. The clinin
of four bier stores keeps Mr. Barnes
on the jump but he is a .trained ath
lete when it comes ftf jumping.at
bargains and is always on the look
out for good things for his customers,
Watchful of the markets, a heavy
buyer and a spot cash dealer, ho is
able to give his patrons tho advant
age of 30 years'- of highly successful
experience as a trained merchant.
Just now the local houso of Barnes &
Metcalfe is, serving ono of its period
ical bargain feasts.
In politics Mr. Barnes is a Demo
crat and in religion he is a Methodist.
Business Change at Gracey.
Gracey, Ky., July 12. Tho firm of
Thurmond & Towler has been dissolv
ed and the two stores will bo run sep
arately in the future. Tho hardware
and grocery departments have been
sold to T. M. Wilson and the dry
goods department is retained by John
L. Thurmond. Jas. Towler, the re
tiring partner, will go to Detroit,
Mich., to seek a location.

FARM WEEKS
FORCOUNTY
Christian Will Have Agricul
tural Chautauqua if Ca
sey's Plan Succeeds.
IN TRIANGULAR CIRCUIT
Pembroke, Croiton and
Clarksville Pike are Con
sidering The Proposition.
Farm Chautauquas for Christian
county is the proposition upon which
County Agent A. M. Casey is now
busily engaged. The question of hav
ing farm chautauquas has come very
forcibly before people of the county
and while no definite action has been
taken up to the present, several towns
seem strongly in favor of having the
tent meetings at which the leaders in
tho state will discuss agricultural
problems.
It now seems probable that Crof-
ton, Pembroke and the Clarksville
Pike Farm Club will hold the chau
tauquas, forming a triangular circuit
around which the program will move.
The Pembroke business men met
Tuesday night and discussed the prop
osition, expressing themselves in fav
or of it and appointing a committee to
act upon the matter. The Clarksville
Pike Farm Club has not acted official
ly but some of its leading members
have stated that the club will back the
movement up to the l'T.it.
The choice of the program will be
left largely with the local committees.
The people will be allowed to make
their own choice of speakers and
workers at the chautau jua. This Will
be a special advantage as it will give
all the members a chance to hear the
be.sMnformed men in the stnt speak
on the subjects that will be of most
interest in this locality.
Aside from the regular f;r m pro
gram, a home ecgnomics fwi'ure will
be added to the program and the wo
man's work will bo one of the most
attractive parts of the program. Lead
ing women speakers and home econ
omists in the state will be brought
here.
The proposition urged by Mr. Ca
sey is to have the chautauqua start on
the first day of August and last three
days. 1
Farm chautauquas have been held
in many progressive counties in the
state and it is now time for Christian
to step in line with the rest.
GEOFFREY MORGAN
VISITS CHRISTIAN
Geoffrey Morgan, state agricultural
agent, paid a visit to Christian county
Tuesday visiting many of the farms
and speaking on modern methods in
farming at the meeting of the Clarks
ville Pike Farm Club, which he or
ganized. The meeting was held at the
Van Cleve school house.
At the school house a rousing nm-
gram, with subjects of interest to the
farmers, was held. Mr. Morgan
made the principal speech but J -.Urc
Walter Knight, Senator Frank R..rs,
Frot. L. b. roster and Judge V T
Fowler made interesting talks on v. oil
chosen subjects.
Mr. Morgan discussed the wnr". nf
tho Hessian fly, which has caused un
usual trouble to tho Christian county
farmers during tins season, and sug
gested things to do to exterminate
that injurious insect.
Prof. Foster advised tho members
of tho Clarksville Pike Farm Club of
tho necessity of building a new school
houso in that section and told them
tliat it would be well to havo the head-
quarters of the farm club in the pro
posed new building.
