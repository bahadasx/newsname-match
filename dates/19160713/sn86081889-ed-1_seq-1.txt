RECORD OF DEATHS.
Short Sketches of the Lives of Per
sons Who Have Recently
Passed Away.
Paul Martin.
Taul Martin who has been in
declining health for a number of
years grew much worse about
ten days ago. His physician
found he was suffering from a
severe attack of erysipelas. His
physical condition was such that
he could not stand the malady
and on last Friday morning, July
7th, he passed quietly away at
the age of 30 years, 4 months
and 22 days.
Paul was a twin son of the late
Christian and Lydia J. Martin
two miles south of McConnells
burg. Most of his life was Bpent at
the old homestead. Paul was a
dutiful eon, a loving brother, and
kind to every one. He was of a
most genial disposition and be
loved by all who knew him. He
was a special favorite of the fam
ily and will be greatly missed.
But we trust their loss will be
his gain. f
During the pastorate of J. V.
Royer, Paul united with the M.
E. church on probation. When
his physical condition would per
mit he spent much time in search
ing the scripture, meditating on
eternal things, and in prayer for
the welfare of his soul. He also
found much pleasure in joining
with his mother in singing spir
itual song3 before bowing around
the faniily altar and we trust he
will sing them forever around
the throne of our Heavenly Fath
er. ' The deceased is survived by his
widowed mother and the follow
ing brothers and sisters: J. M.,
'Velsh Run, Pa.; W. F. Greens
'mrg, Ind. ; S. R. Gambler, Ohio;
A. P., Welsh Run, Pa.; J. H. near
Mercersburg, Pa.; A. J., McCon
lellsburg; I). W., Madrid, Iowa;
5. C. (twin brother to Paul)
Vest Wood, Cal.; Mrs. A. W.
, Stuff, Batavia, 111.; Miss Lydia.
Oakland, Cal. ; and Misses Bar
bara and Clara at home.
Funeral services were held at
!iis home at ten o'clock Monday
norning conducted by Revs. Dan
el Hawbaker and Rev. Samuel
Meyers.
The remains were laid to rest
in the family cemetery in the
presence of a large concourse
of friends and neighbors. The
beautiful floral tributes conveyed
many messages of sympathy from
Paul's young friend3.
Miss Mary Norma Stouteagle.
Mis3 Mary Nmora Stouteagle
died at the home of her father,
W. Frank Stouteagle in this place
early Monday morning. She had
been in failing health for several
months, but was confined to her
bed twelve weeks'. The funeral
services were conducted at the
M. E. church by her pastor, Rev.
, Edward Jackson at 10 o'clock,
yesterday morning.
Miss Stouteagle was a daugh
ter of W. Frank and Susie Dun
lap Stouteagle, and was born
March 13, 1887; hence, he was
ag(d 29 years, 3 months and
27 days. She was a member
'of the M. E. church since she
was twelve years of age, and un
til her health failed, she was
foremost in everything pretain
ing to the welfare and best inter
eats of the Sunday school and
church. Possessing a remark
ably sweet and earnest disposi
tion, she left- an influence for
good that will forever permeate
the lives of those with whom she
came in contact during her com
paratively short life.
. Besides her father, she is sur
vived by one sister, Miss 1 Jean-
nette. Her mother died about
twenty-two years ago.
Lynn Davis. ,
Lynn Davis died at his home
in Bedford on Thursday morning
f last week aged about 28 years.
The funeral took place Sunday
afternoon and interment was
made In Bedford cemetery.
Lynn was a son of Mr. and
In His Eighty-Sixth.
Our friend "Uncle Sam" Ben
der came into the office one day
last week to push his subscrip
tion ahead another year. He is
a veteran of the Civil War, and
is in his 8Gth years. He feels
fairly well and his mind is clear,
but he does not get down town
very frequently. While he did
not spend as many months in the
army a3 many others, he saw
much of the real thing. Being a
drafted man, he was thrown di
rectly into an old regiment (the
100th Regiment Pennsylvania In
fantry) and sent right to the
front. He wa3 in the thickest of
the fights around Petersburg and
Richmond, and was only a short
distance away from Appamattox
the day Lee surrendered.
It is said that it cost $15,000 to
kill a man in war, under present
modes of fighting.
Mrs. A. Curtin Davis, his moth
er being Annie Stoner, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Merrick A. Sto
ner. His father died last March
a year, and since that time Lynn
had charge of his father's ton-
sorial parlors. The deceased had
been married, but his wife pre
ceded him to the grave several
years ago. One chil4 is living
with' the mother's parents near
Rainsburg. Among those attend
ing the funeral Sunday afternoon
were Mr. and Mrs. John Martin
of Chambersburg accompanied
by Mrs. Martin's brother and sis
ter, Bruce and Jennie Stoner, of
this place, and by Albert Stoner
and son Frank also of ' McCon
nellsburg. Jacob Dunkle.
Again has death invaded a
hitherto unbroken family circle
and claimed as his victim, Jacob,
husband of Mary Dunkle. The
deceased was born at Spring Run
Frankling county October 1S55
and died at his home at Fort Lit
tleton July 8 aged almost Gl yrs.
He was united in marriage
with Miss Mary Kerlin in 1883,
who survives him. He is also
survived by one brother George,
of Spring, Run, and one sister
Mrs. Mary Richardson, of Ship-
pensburg.
He was a quiet unostentatious
citizen, a kind, accommodating
neighbor and he will be ' greatly
missed. He served in various
township offices and was faithful
in the discharge of his duty. For
more than a year he had been
the victim of that dreaded dis
ease tuberculosis which was the
cause of hi3 death. The funeral
services were held on Tuesday
morning at 10 o'clock with Rev.
Reidell of Hustontown officiating
after which the remains reposing
in a beautiful casket was sorrow
fully laid to rest byJoving hands.
We extend our sympathy to
the widow in her home of sore
bereavement, but human sympa
thy is frail, and we would com
mend her to Him by whose lov
ing hand the blow has been delt,
William F. Hughes.
William F. Hughes died sud
denly at his home in Philadelphia
July 5, 1916, aged 67 years, ' Mr,
Hughes was a t on of the late Da
vid Hughes and grew to young
manhood in McConnellsburg. Pos
sessingB keen intellect he stood
at the head of his classes in the
public schools in his home town,
began to teach at the age of six
teen, later graduated at the Cum
berland Valley State Normal
School, and taught in the eastern
part of the State several years.
He then established a school of
Physical Culture in . Philadelphia
t t i i. ii . i
in wnicn ne spent me remainder
of his life.
The deceased was an indefati
(.able student, and his articles on
Potany and kindred subjects as
published from time to time in
the News will be missed. His
widow, who resides in Philadel
phia, has the sincere sympathy
of their Fulton County friends
in the loss of her companion.

HARVEST ING ACCIDENT.
George Cooper Loses Life " by Being
Caught in Binder at Scott TritlcY
Monday Afternoon.
Monday afternoon Scott Tritie
was running a reaper in one of
the wheatfields on his farm in
the Cove. The machine wa3
drawn -by four horse3 two
abreast. George Cooper, aged
18, son of Philip Cooper, was
driving the team, and Mr. Tritie
was seated on the reaper. The
eaders were not working to
please Cooper, and he jumped off
the saddle horse, kept the lines
in his hand, and proceeded to
"lick up" the near leadar. Thi3
started the team, the line broke,
and in attempting to escape the
cutting-bar, he fell and waa
caught by the divider and thrown
beneath the cutter-bar, and was
dragged about sixty yards, his
body being cut and bruised most
shockingly. Miss Virginia Tritie
seeing the team approaching the
open burs, closed the opening and
stopped the team.
Dr. Mosser was summoned by
phone and at once went to the
young man's side, but nothing
could be done to save his life. In
an hour and fifty minutes from
the time he was caught by the
binder, he passed away.
The funeral took place at ten
o'clock Tuesday morning and in
terment was made in Union cem
etery.
Why Not Drill ?
Why not have a Fulton County
Company of drilled men who
would offer themselves in case of
emergency, or in case a call 13
made for volunteers? The cost
need be nothing. We have men
in the county who are capable of
drilling others in the manual of
arms. The discipline would be
good for any young man. He
need not "go to the army" to
reap the benefits of his training
if not needed there. It would
bring to the surface traits that
would develop him for leadership
in local affairs. It would develop
qualities that would help him to
be more successful in his calling.
Arid then just to think how his
best girl would snuggle up to her
"soldier boy!" We feel sure
there are many young men in the
County who would avail them
selver of an opportunity to drill.
The United States government
is offering to furnish guns and
ammunition to just such groups
of men.
Odd Accident.
An odd accident occurred at
the Linn garage last Sunday
when J. M. Hughes, of Beaver
Falls was assisting Mack Linn to
adjust a tire. The tire was in
flated with 70 pounds pressure
on a detachable rim. The two
men were hammering the rim to
its place on the wheel when the
inner tube bursted blowing the
steel band away with such force
that when it struck Hughes on
the forehead he was knocked
nearly senseless. Mack escaped
with severe bruises on the bi
ceps. Dr. Robinson dressed the
Hughes wounds which consisted
of cuts and bruises.
Railroad News.
The latest news in our railroad
circles was a telegram dated at
Pittsburgh, Monday evening, Ju
ly 10th, stating that the construe
tion outfits were enroute, and
that the contractors would be in
McConnellsburg July l?th ready
to begin work as soon as the par
aphernalia arrived.
Harvest Home.
The trustees and stewards 0
the Cito A. M. E. Church will
hold a harvest home festival on
the church grounds July 22nd.
The McConnellsburg Band will
render some good music. Come
and enjoy the evening. Rev. W.
Sjiriggs.

0a Way to Mexico.
Dear Editor: Thinking that
news from the boys who will fol
low the flag to Mexico might in
terest readers and some of my
friends in Fulton county, I will
endeavor from time to time to
send you word from our camps.
We are now waiting equipment
and are anxious to go off to the
front.' a
Company C left Chambersburg
June 24th and arrived at Camp
Brumbaugh, Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
same day, On the 26th the nath
was administered and to our sor
row, five of our Company pot
cold feet and hikod it back home,
leaving us with 6!) men. On the
following Monday, we received
our first inoculation of typhoid
serum and were vaccinated. We
f-oon rallied and were ready for
duty. The Fourth was spent
very quietly in camp.
July 5th we were called to the
hospital for final examination
and we lost ten men by reason of
physical defects. However, our
number has been increased to 64
by the admission of "roekies"
who joined since we came to
camp. On the same day we were
given another dose of 20 drops of
typhoid serum and this morning
(July 6th) some of the boys are
feeling pretty sore from the ef
fects.
Our last orders were to be
ready to leave Sunday morning
for the Border, to be stationed
close to El Paso, Texas. Present
indications are that we will be
gone about three months. With
kindest regards to my parents
and all friends in Little Fulton.
John C. Bishop,
Co. C, 8 Reg. 4th Brig., Camp
Brumbaugh, Mt. Gretna, Pa.
Editor's Note: John Bishop
is a son of Mr. and Mrs. William
M. Bishop, near Big Cove Tan
nery. Rubbed by Gypsies.
One day last week, while Wayne
Taylor was at work in the rear
of hi3 confection stand at Val
mont Park, on the west side of
Cove mountain, a Gypsy woman
tapped his till, stealing several
dollars in cash. Wayne heard
the auto stop, but as he heard no
footsteps on the floor above him,
he supposed they were taking
water an hourly occurrence at
the Park. However, he came to
the front in time to see the wo
man tip-toe away and enter the
auto which at once hurried away.
Wayne turned to the stand but
did not at once notice anything
wrong. He then opened the till
and discovered his loss. By that
time, the machine was out of
sight, free from capture.
There has not been a summer
passed for many years that com
plaint of robberies by Gypsies
has not reached this office. Not
withstanding the law that would
forever rid us of these pests,
they are again and again permit
ted to camp in the County. Bur
gess Seylar chased them out of
town twice, but they seemed to
be aware that they will not be
disturbed on the outlying dis
tricts. They are a bad set. But
until they are made to under
stand that $50 camp fee will be
collected by law, we will be sub
ject to their depredations.
Value of Walking.
There is hardly an instance of
a long-lived man or woman, who
ha3 not been for the best oart of
his or her life a brisk walker and
for some reason or other has had
to take exercise pretty well every
day.
Riding is all very well and so
are other exercises, but there is
nothing like a good walk, because
it stimulates the blood and the
nuiscle8 and necessitates being
in the open. If those who com
plain of being stout would only
think of this and never omit a
daily constitutional, they would
be amply rewarded. It will keep
them young and their figures
presentable. It is simply a rem'
edy that few heed.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, SI. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Infantile Paralysis is a disease
that affects the nervous system.
It often causes death, and again
the acute stage frequently sub
sides and leaves paralysis of one
or more of the limbs that hereto
fore has often lasted on through
life.
Today we do not know what
causes the disease, therefore pre
ventive measures must bo broad.
You must keep the children away
from insect life, such a3 flies,
mosquitoes, fleas, bed bugs, ants
ticks, lice, etc. You should see
that all rats and mice around the
building are killed. Pet cats and
dogs should be washed with a
two per cent carbolic acid solu
tion to destroy insect life. Ev
erything should be kept clean
about the home, including the
children's bodies and clothing.
Children should be fed well
but not indulged in large quan
tities of water, ice cream or oth
er frozen dishes on a full stom
ach, as that will often cause
acute indigestion and render on
them susceptible to other diseas
es. In otner worus, tne diges
tion should be guarded carefully.
Children should have plenty of
sleep. They should not associate
with other children that are sick.
Their homes should be well ven
tilated but screened from flies,
etc., and any flies that happen
to enter the building should be
killed. All foodstuffs should be
protected from flies, dust, etc.
Fruit and vegetables eaten raw
should be thoroughly washed in
clean water.
Children's mouths should be
rinsed out and their throats gar
gled with Dobell's solution after
each meal. If the children are
too young to rinse or gargle,
wash the mouth with a piece of
fabric, muslin or linen, that has
been dipped in Dobell's solution.
Children should be kept out of
crowded places and be denied the
frequent access to crowded halls
of entertainment during our pres
ent threat with epidemic.
The youngsters should not be
permitted to sit on the damp
ground nor have their bodies
thoroughly chilled, day or night.
They should not bathe in cold
water until their circulation is
interfered with and they become
chilly and blue.
Post Office Gets New Order.
The local post-office force has
been notified by the Department
at Washington, D. C. that, by
reason of the early arrival of the
evening mail from the East, the
windows and doors of the office
proper could be closed at 8 o'
clock P. M., by allowing the lob
by to remain open until a later
time. Postmaster Lamberson
will put the new time for closing
into operation Monday, July 17th.
No stamps will be sold or no mail
will be delivered by the office em
ployees after 8 o'clock P. M. The
lobby of the office will remain
open for the deposit of mail.
Employers' Liability.
The question of whether or not
farmers are liable for accidents
which may befall those persons
employed by them in the per
formance of general farm labor
will likely be settled in the case
of George Cooper who lost his
life in the harvest field at Scott
Tritle's Monday. It is contended
by many that the law does not
apply to farmers. If so the fam
ily of the deceased will not be
paid any damage. Mr. Tritie,
however, did not take any chanc
es, and he is carrying the neces
sary protection.
Card of Thanks. ,
I desire through the medium of
The News, to thank all my
friends and neighbors who so
kindly assisted me during the
sickness and death of my hus
band. Mrs. Mary Dunkle.
Reunion of Fulton Ohio People.
Seventeen years ago, about a
score of former Fulton county
people who then lived in North
ern Ohio met and formed an as
sociation for purely social inter
course. Since then, they have
annually met at some point con
venient for the majority. The
association has grown until it now
numbers nearly one hundred.
This year, they met at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Rice, of
Tiffin, Ohio. The weather being
bad, only about forty members
were present, but other guests.
swelled the number in attend
ance to about seventy-five. How
ever, the rain ceased in time to
dry off the grass by noon and a
sumptuous dinner wa3 served.
Our friends out there have not
forgotten their eastern piety, for
we are told that when all were
seated at the dinner table, the
Doxology was sung and Mr. Ohler
led in an appropriate prayer. Un
like many Oklahoma brethren,
our Ohio friends eat chicken
plenty of it along with other
good things.
The formal exercises of the
afternoon were opened by Presi
dent Charles Funk, followed by
an address of welcome by Gilbert
Rice. Several appropriate selec
tions were sung by the party.
Mrs. Delia Garland gave a reci
tation, Mrs. Ross Hixon sang a
solo, and the following made ad
dresses: Henry Detterman, Eph
raim Mellott, Mr. Shaw, E. C.
Brundage, H. A. Ohler, Thomas
Truax, and others, all being thor
oughly enjoyed.
This Association has decided to
make a new list of members be
fore the next reunion, each fami
ly being requested to send names
to the Secretary, Mr. Gilbert
Garland. Present officers of the
Association were re-elected and
the following committee of ar
rangements appointed: Mrs.
Delia Garland, Miss Ethel Peck
and Mrs. Calvin Keefer. Mr.
Walter Shaw and family, of Big
Cove Tannery, and Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas "Truax, of Sharpe, were
Fulton county guests at the Re
union this year. Next Reunion
will be held at the home of Mr.
and Mrs William Spade, Tif
fin, Ohio, on the second Saturday
of June, 1917, to which all will
look forward in anticipation of
another day of unalloyed pleas
ure.
Didn't Want "Boys".
Last week, D. E. Fore who re
cently celebrated his 90th anni
versary, determined to help in
the 1916 harvest fields just to
keep in practice. He offered his
service as driver of the reaper to
a neighbor close by, but it seems
the "Boss" didn't want boys in
the field and very firmly refused
to grant Mr. Fore's request. But
like many other ambitious young
fellows, Daniel made up his mind
that he will not take "no" for
answer, and he will try again
this time when hayraking time
comes, after wheat harvest. We
have always been in favor of giv
ing the boys a chance on the
farm, it tends to keep them at
home.
Car Tamed Turtle.
On July 4th, Wm. II. Morgan,
