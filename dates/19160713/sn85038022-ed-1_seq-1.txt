Today marks the opening of the
second half of the season of the Ohio
State league. The league, aa It la
now composed of four clubs, Mayaville,
Chilllcothe, Portsmouth and Lexing
ton, will finish tho season, despite of
what all the knockers say.
Mayaville will open at Chilllcothe,
the new member of the Lcagae, while
Portsmouth will open at Lexington
The teams are all evenly matched per
haps more so than ever before. Maya
ville hna been strengthened by the ad
dition of several new players and Is
now regarded aa the best team In the
league. They demonstrated this by
the way they beat Portsmouth on last
Saturday. Of course, some might see
It. another way, but we predict that
they are heading the list on September
4th.
Portsmouth has a good team, and
their work la fast and snappy. Where
they will fall down la too muen of
this "We're the best players in the
L ague" stuff. Lexington is the next
best possible contender for the rag af
ter Maysvllle. Chlllicothe should fin
ish third. They have a team picked
from the outgoing teams and should
play good ball for the rest of the Benson.

"The Square Deal Man
The annual Convention of the Ma
aon County Sunday School Aaaocla
tlon will be held Friday In Boechwood
Park. The convention will laat all
day and the delegates are urged to
bring luuch so aa not to leave the
grounds. The program will be held
in Um park auditorium.
Thla is tho first annual convention
to be held in thla city for several
years, as they are generally held In
some country church where the city
workers can not get to. readily. By
holding the convention In the city It
Is believed that more of the country
people can alao attend as they can
also do their Saturday shopping
One of the chief matters to come up
before the convention la the selection
of a County Superintendent of Sun
day Schools. Since the resignation of
Mr. T. J. Currey several weeks ago,
this office has been vacant and will
be filled at the meeting.
Another matter of Importance to
conic up la the matter of Inviting the
State Convention to hold Its session
here in 1917. This matter ia being
boosted by the Chamber of Commerce
and would be good advertisement for
the city. There is no reason why the
convention should not meet here as
this city is conveniently situated for
such a convention, much better ao
than Ashland, where tho convention
will be held this year. It is hoped
that the convention will decide to In
vite the assembly for next year.
Tho speakers for the day are some
of the most prominent Sunday School
workers in the Btate and they will
give some of their own experiences in
the work. The main speaker is Dr
W, C. Condlt of Ashland, who will give
hla llluatrated lecture "The Taber
nacle". Dr. Condlt has given this lec
ture hundreds of times and it is sonic
thing worth while. Mr. W. J. Vaughn,
the state association worker, will give
an address In tho morning session and
also in the afternoon. Several other
f-xcollent speakers will be heard.
All of tho Sunday School workers
and members should make it a point
to get out to hear these speakers
There will be no admission fe s to
the grounds but a free will offering
will be taken at both sessions Tor the
work of the Sunday Schools. Kach
school of the county and city Is re
quested to appoint a delegate, who
will give a one minute report, stating
the condition of school work. The
convention will begin at 9 a. m. and
