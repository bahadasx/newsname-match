CREAMERY CHECKS
LARGEST ON RECORD
Lynden dairymen received more
money for their cream during the
months of May and June than ever
!be fore in the history of the district.
Figures given out by H. TSlenbaas.
i rrauager of the Lynden Creamery
;Co., today show that during the two
'months creamery checks totalled
$63,828.84.
For May, the dairymen received
$32,728.76, some $4,000 more than
in May last year; in June, tbe total
was $31,100.08, or $3,000 more thai
,in tbe same month In 1915.
Higher prices account for the in
crease, as the Creamery handled
! 2,000 pounds of butterfat less each
month than in 1915. Butterfat
prices last year were 27c and 28c
in May, and 29c in June, as agasns*
31c and 32c in May this year, and
32c in June. \
The decrease In tbe amount of
cream received is due to the good
price now being paid by the con
denserie6 for whole milk. War or
! ders have advanced the demand for
' condensed milk considerably over
that of last year.
Tbe Lyudeu Creamery Co. shi-i-
I ped out 50,000 pounds of butter
last week for the government, and
will deliver 54.000 additional
pounds during the next four weeks.
