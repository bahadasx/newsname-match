Some of the boys of the NationJ.
Guard have met with defeat sooner
than they had any reason to suppose
~they might. We refer, of coruse, .:•
tfce physical examination on mustering
initio tKe federal service. It is no light
reverse for the young men who have
Iseen rejected on account of failure to
•come up to the strict standard of phy
sical condition required by the United
Stated government.
With the most commendable motives
they submitted themselves at armory,
jiin&e grounds and maneuvers at th«
-stetecamp to prepare themselves fot
possible service to the commonwealth
^vTCOUntry. When occasion for this
seftrfce arose they responded to the
'Call. They bade good-bye to kin and
friends and went to the state camp,
to be followed thither for repeated
adieux. Now a few of them have had
to take the train for home as physi
cally unfit for the possibly very ar
-dous activity that will be required of
all who shall be soldiers on the border
«r.in Mexico.
In the rejected portion are young
men who are apparently very rugged
specimen^ of young manhood. No
^oubt many a onewassurprised that
a (Skjualifying flaw was found in him,
ana proud boys will feel deeply the
humiliation of having this attested by
so unanswerable an authority as the
United States army medical examin
•erfl.
But it is no disgrace unless defect
is due to some vicious habit or excess,
for the examination is exceedingly
rigorous. The government does not
want men who may break down at
some Weak spot when the great strain
inevitable in a military campaign,
coble. It must pick men who stand
^j&j£st chance of staying in line and
:^'3$iqjg to the hospital.
•4 .Jrli'fatit that a man is rejected does
Oil signify that he will not
ba£k toj the farm, shop or office and
live an active lifein perfect health un
til oldage. Among those #hom Un
cle Sam refuses to enroll are ho doubt
many local reputations as ath
letes, and yet each with one weak spot
or uhfairorable .tendency that the xe
(jpifcjuients of civ® life and ordinary
physical exercise will neverreveal, but
the hardships of campaigning1
•dghtsoondiscover.
Hie same discrimination hag been
going on at all the state mobilization
camps. The testing hammers have
Teen used on the young, men of the
guard as on the wheels of a train. If
"the need of men were greater, ho
doubt the examination would be less
•exacting, but until the necessity arises
"the government will not increase its
ownrisks by abating its requirements.

"Do you want to enlist to go to Mex

"No," was the reply, "I want to en

MOW WEEDS IN PASTURE
Mowing the weeds in the pasture
-gives the grass and clover a better
chance. It is hard on the weeds too.
Set the mower high so as not to cut
the pasture plants. When the weeds
are allowed to grow they make their
growth at the expense of the pasture
-plants. A few sheep in the cattle
pasture will take care of the weeds if

CRAFT EXPECTED TO RETURN
LADEN WITH WAR SUPPLIES
Baltimore, Md., July 9.—The world's
first submarine merchantman, the
German under water liner Deutsch
land, anchored below Baltimore to
night,- after voyaging safely across the
Atlantic, passing the Allied blockading
squadroia and eluding eneAiy cruisers
watching for her off the American
coast.
It carries mail and a cargo of many
tons of costly chemicals and dye stuffs.
It is to carry back home a similar
amount of nickel and crude rubber,
sorely needed by the Geramn army.
The submarine is said to carry
personal message from the Emperor
of Germany to President Wilson. This
information, it was represented came
directlyfrom the captain of the sub
marine.'
Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine reached
safety hfctweentfhe Virginia Capes at
1:45 today, passing in on the surface
covered by a heavy pall of darkness
which seteltd oyer the entrance of the
bay with'the setting of a tell-tale half
moon.
Shrieks Siren Boldly, Calling Pilot.
Once inside the visitor threw cau
tion aside and began shrieking its si
ren, signalling a pilot and at the same
time attracting the attention of the
tug Thomas F. Timmons, which had
been waiting in the lower bay for
nearly two weeks to greet the
Deutschland and convoy her into port.
Three hours later at 4:45 the big
submarine started up the bay, with the
German Merchant flag flying, under
its own power, piloted by Captain F.
D. Cocke, of the Virginia Pilots asso
ciation, and convoyed by the Tim
mon.
It was making more than twelve
knots an hour and could have docked
in Baltimore tonight but arrangements
had been made for receiving it with
formal ceremonies tomorrow and its
captain was ordered to wait in the
lower harbor. He and his crew of 29
men remain aboard their craft.
Coast Guard Cutter Speeds in Pursuit
Regarding his vessel as a merchant
man, subject to no unusual restrictions
the skipper, whose name is said to be
Captain Karig, went up the Chesa
peake without waiting to notify local
customs and quarantine authorities of
his presence.
He was five hours away before Nor
man Hamilton, collector of the Nor
folk-New Port News ports, heard of
the submarine's presence and started
on his trail aboard the coast guard
cutter Onondaga.
The chase was abandoned after the
submarine had passed the Virginia
line into Maryland waters.
Hamilton said tonight that Captain
Chiswell, of the cutter, undertook the
pursuit at his request, to ascertain if
the Deutschland intended to remain in
those waters off Chesapeake bay un
der Hamilton's jurisdiction.
Mystery in Voyage Across Atlantic.
Little was known here tonight about
what happened during the epoch-mak
ing cruise across the ocean, which in a
small measure at least, breaks the
blockade on German trade with the
rest of the world. None of the sub
marine's crew had landed and the ag
ents of its owners had received only
meager reports.
Such information as was available
came directly from the pilot and from
Captain Hans F. Hinsch of the North
German Lloyd liner Neckar, laid up
here since the beginning of the war.
6aptain Hinsch boarded the Duetsch
land from the Timmons and made the
trip up the bay with it.
According to the accounts reaching
here tonight, the under water liner's
superstructure was standing fifteen

InGerman quarters here the news of

with the keenest delight. Those who
knew of it coming had been conceal

was due to arrive about the middle of
last week. It is understood that she
traveled more than 4,000 miles, gji -g

Washington, July 12.—Living up to
its reputation as the greatest single
factor for peace in America, the Unit
ed States Marine Corps, with the loss
of a few men killed and wounded, has
quietly and effectually quelled the lat
est-revolt-in Santo Domingo, and,
without time lost in undue parley has
forced the rebel chieftains to lav
down their arms and return to peace
ful pursuits, according to late advices
from Monte Christo. The United
States Marines iow control the entir
island on which" JlSfti and Santo Do
mingo ate situated, and that control
was gained without serious fighting or
great loss of life it is claimed, be
cause of the. the thorough prepared
ness of Ihe marines for the business
at hand and their knowledge of the
people and their ways.
USE CARE WITH ALFALFA.
It is not well to feed alfalfa hay in
too large quantities to brood mares,
and this is a matter in which precau
tion should be taken. Horses tend to
become bloated if allowed to overfeed
on alfalfa hay, especially if the hay is
in a more or less green stage. It is
always advisable when alfalfa hay is
to be fed to horses to allow the alfalfa
to remain in the field until well ma
tured. The danger of bloating in
horses is especially great in the cas°
of mares in foal. These precaution

*r f"

are not necessary in feeding alfalfa
to cattle, and, in fact, the green alfal
fa hay is very desirable for dairy cat
tle. Good.t-esults have been'obtained
in feeding brood mares by limiting
their alfalfa to one-third of the total
amount of the roughage fed to them.

GERMANS SUCCEED IN GETTING
FOOTING IN DAMLOUP BAT
TERY.
^London, July 11.—The British gains
in the battle of the Somme, afer ten
day's continuous fighting, cover a
front of nearly eight miles and include
the entire German first system of de
fenses, according to the official report
forwarded by General Haig, the Brit
ish commander-in-chief on the French
front.
This advance includes a number of
small towns and villages and positions
which are considered of great strate
gic importance.
Take Fortified Positions.
The British advance extended into
the German positions for a depth of
2,000 to 4,000 yards. Many of them
were strongly fortified. The woods
were full of trenches and surrounded
by barbed wires and what General
Haig describes as immensely strong
redoubts, had to be carried by storm.
At the same tinte, the Frnech army
under General Foch has moved up in
the southern section of 'the Somme un
til it now holds the dominating hills
around Peronne, the poMleision of
which the Germans are likely to con
test with utmost determination.
Retake Contalmaigpn ..
TRgr British haVfe taken Qont&Itriai
son and are again in control of near
ly th eentire extent of Trones wood
and Mametz wood.
The French along the Somme car
ried some minor detached positions
which enabled them to strengthen
their positions at LaMaisonnette and
apparently they are waiting for the
British to strengthen their lines before
making the attempt to drive the Ger
mans out of Peronne.
Take 220,00 Prisoners
In this great battle about 22,000
prisoners have been taken by the
Franco-British forces, of whom the
British announce they have captured
7,500.
In the Verdun sector, the Germans
have succeeded in getting a footing
in the Damloup battery, which has
been a bone of contention for days
past, and in the French line in the
Fumin wood on the right bank of the
Meuse. At other points the Ger
mans are carrying put a strong offen
sive.
On the Russian front, the Stockhod
sector is the central point of the Rus
sian advance. The Germans have
brought up strong re-inforcements and
attempted to oppose the Russians who
now are within 20 miles-of Kovel. The
defenses of this town are believed to
be powerful.
Furious Fighting
Fighting along th siline is of a fur.
ious nature, as it was while the Rus
sians were crossing the river at var
ious points.
In southern Bukowiua, Petrograd
reports that considerable enemy forces
have been put to fight northwest o£
Kimpolvng.
Vienna a&seris that the Russians at
tack at Sokul and along the
have been repulsed.
Up to July 10, the drive of Ge&$ra'
Brussiloff had resulted in the capture
of 271,620 prisoners, it is officially an

FLY TIME.
Summer time is fly time. Enough
house flies always live over winter
to give the species a start for another
season, and no means has yet been
discovered of giving perfect immurJ
ty from the pest. Comparative im
munity may be secured only by the
practice of constant and unvarying
vigilance. That freedom, or com
paratively freedom from flies is worth
all the effort that it costs is beco-Ti
ing more and more generally recog
nized, for there is a better knowledge
than formerly of the manner in which
the house fly interests with huma8
comfort, and human health, and the
menace that it is to the human life.
The fly is born with filth, lives
filth, and carries filth from piace to
place. He browses on waste matter
which provides the breeding groun.1.
for bacteria of innumerable diseases,
and when he returns from his forag
ing among the decaying matter in the
back yard to meander over the butter
and march across the frosting of the
cake, be carries these bacteria by the
million, and distributes them imparti
ally over-everything that he touches.
He is the purveyor of practically
every bacteria' disease with whicfj
food can be contaminated. Because
he spoils food he increases the size ,of
our groeery bills. He is the sour*e
of many of our doctors' bills and
because of him many a procession
wends its way to the cemetery many
years before the services of the undet

required.
To avoid the fly nuisance .the f.
essential is to deprive the insect of
