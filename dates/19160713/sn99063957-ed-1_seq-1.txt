HIS ORDERS CAUSED THE
i BATTLE AT CARRIZAL
Charge He Sent Large Sup
plies to Jiminez So Rebels
Could Get Them
El Paso, Texas, July 1.1. Informa
tion received here that Carranza Gen
eral Trevino furnished Villa with mu
nitions cast doubt today on Treviuo's
report of attacks by his men on the
bandits operating in the Parral district.
Telegraphic communication was cut
ly Villistag south of Chihuahua during
the night. The "break" is believed
to be in the vicinity of Santa Rosalia
oud north of the point where the main
body of Villistag aro operating.
Carranza agents have furnished Uni
ted states officials here with detailed
charges of a plot by Trevino o assist
the rebel movement in northern Mex
ico with the ultimate purpose of re
placing Villa at its head.
This, coupled with the attack on
American troops at Carrizal by Tre
vino ' orders, nearly precipitating war,
is said to have caused War Minister
Obregon 's orders replacing Trevino
with Governor General Ignacio En
riquez. Rumors that Enriquez was jail
ed at Torreon by Trevino 'g order or
that Enriquez fell Into the hands of
Villiatas and was executed are without
confirmation.
Arrivals from Chihunhna today stat
ed that Trevino has imprisoned Gen
erals Jose Tnez Knlazar and Marcel
Caraveo, former Huerta commanders
who were recently granted amnesty by
Obregon. Trevino wns ordered by Obre
gon a week ago to give both men com
mands in the Carranza division of the
north.
Obregon has ordered the arrest of
General Roque Gomez, former Huerta
commander, who was InBt reported at
Canas Grandes fleeing to the American
expedition's lines to escape arrest.
Six former Villistu generals now in
Juarez Medina veita, Bousa, Bauda,
Ochoa and two others are reported to
be attempting to turn the Carranza
Snrricon to the bnndit leader. Ochoa
was arrested by Carranza officials for
crying "viva Villa" and "death to old
whiskers" while in a Juarez saloon but
the other former Villistns secured his
release.
The significance of Trevino 's con
centrating at Chihuahua City all troops
loyal to him, since receiving word of
his transfer to Monterey, is also suspect-,
d by Carranza agents here. Even part
of the Juarez garrison and practically
all the army he mobilized in Villa Aliu
rnuda to check General Pershing's move
ments are now in Chihuahua City. Gen
eral Sebastian Carranza and General A.
Musquiz, both nephews of General Car
Tnnza, left El l'aso today for Mexico
City to make a personal report on their
observation of Trevino 's actions.

They are expected to charge Trevino
with purposely sending large supplies
of munitions to point in the vicinity of
Jiminez. the supplies later falling into
Villa's hands.
The daily arrival of militia regiments

Reform
Rich Mistresses
Denver, Colo., July 13. Sabotage is
the new weapon the Denver Domestic
Workers' union will use to reform rich
mistresses, Miss Jane Street, organiz
er, said today there is nothing like
sabotage to train housewives as their
maids and cooks would have them.
About 1,000 housewives here are listed
with the union, their virtues and faults
catalogued and classified.
Interesting things happen when an
T. W. W. maid or cook arrives in a
black listed household to turn the
mistress in the way she should honor
and obey her servants. Red pepper
in soup, "accidental" falling of
priceless china, salty sherbert at mi
lady's bridge party, hot tea "acci
dentally" poured on ones gown where
it is deeolette and father's shirt is too
stiff with much starch make the house
wife treat the next maid or cook with
proper respect, say the union leaders.

TERRIFIC BATTLE

Storm Approaches to
Fort Souville
BATTLE FOR FORTRESS
WAS BEGUN 146 DAYS AGO
Determined Attack of British
Calls Out German Rein
forcements By Henry Wood
(United Press staff correspondent)
I'aris, July 13. Dense German mass
es are storming the approaches to
Fort Souville in the seventh great as
sault on Verdun since the battle for
the fortress began 140 days azo.
The violence of yesterday's attacks
furnished unmistakable evidence that
Germany is determined to continue the
attack on Verdun, regardless of her
critical position on other fronts.
French military critics agreed on this
point today after studying the reports
trom, Headquarters.
The Germans kept up a violent bom
bardment throughout the night on the
sector of Souville and Chenois and
Laufee, but made no infantry attacks,
the war office announced today.
The present attack begun Tuesday.
The Germans had spent eighteen days
in preparation. They brought up new
guns nnd trench mortars, shifted more
troops from the west bank of the
Meuse and hurried fresh supplies of
ammunition to the Souville-Daniloup
sector.
The French, ready to meet . the
shock, turned loose a sheeted firo into
the advancing German ranks and took
terrible toll with the "75 ''. Through
out Tuesday night and all day yester
day the battle raged on the Souville-
Damloup sector, tiie French counter
attacking with great spirit.
Only at one point, near the intersec
tion of the Fleury and Vaux roads did
the German attack gain any ground.
Crisis on British Sector
London, July 13. The second phase
of the British offensive is approach
ing a crisis in the battle northeast of
Albert, where British troops are striv
ing to advance two miles eastward to
the height of Martinpuch.
The Germans' have thrown two
whole army corps into action on both
sides of the Albert-Bapnumo road to
defend the approaches to Bapnume.
They are making the most savage
counter attacks, particularly southeast
of Contalmaison, where a German suc
cess would hold up the whole British
advance.
German correspondents, admitting
the great power of the British offen
sive, claim that the attacking forces
have suffered heavy losses comparable
only to the casualties at Verdun. Brit
ish correspondents that English losses
have been severe only in the death
grapple for possession of villages
where German machine guns have
played on the British lines.
No Canadian or Australian troops
have taken part in the Somme offens
ive thus far, but the Newfoundland

It is strange tho Germanss should
put lorward their present contention
iu view of the action of their commerce 1
destroying cruisers, such as the Em-'
den, Karlsnrue and Prince Eitel which I
during the early months of the war
sank many allied and neutral vessels.)
Their action was not based on the)
ground of reprisals, but was exercised :
by virtue of what they considered be
Kgerent rights. Moreover, the Germans
at the outset of war sowed mines indis
criminately on trade routes on the high
seas.
"The chancellor accused Great Brit
ain of lack of good faith in not adopt
ing the declaration. He apparently has
forgotten that the United States gov
ernment as early as 1814, recognized
that the declaration was not binding
without the express agreement by the
belligerents.
"The declaration had in fact no bind-
ing force at all in low, as it had not
been ratified by any of the signatories
and indeed had been repudiated by one
chamber of the British parliament. It
wa in this respect very different from
the treaty guaranteeing the neutrality
of Belgium, which was absolutely bind
ing upon the signatories, but -which
Germany callously, violated the moment

President Wilson Points Out
High Position We Are

By Robert 3, Bender.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington. July 13. S neakinoi Via-
fore the citizenship convention today
President Wilson declared America is
intended to be a "spirit among nations
of tho world."
America, he declared, should hn the
finest example of the objects and idenls
that go to nromoto the stnndorr1. nf
the world.
"You should find the best wnv to
introduce to new comers this spirit,"
saia tne prosident. "It is not fair to
the multitudes of men and women of
other countries that we should leave
thom without that friendly help which
win enable them to find out what
America ig like and what she stands
for. '
'These people should be educated in
the same schools that all of us aro edtr-
cnted in, that furnished by the life
of the community to which we belong.
"I don't doubt that many a simple
soul has been . stirred by the' statute of
liberty which represents the ideals of
men. Thinking on this has caused me
to turn on myself the light of tiA-csU-pntion
to sec if there burned there tho
true fire of America, as those coming
expect to find It. -
"America is intended to be a spirit
among the nations of the world. You
should find the best way to introduce
to new comers this spirit.
"America should be tho finest ex-
nmplo not the only example of tho
things which go to promote the stand
ards of the world.
Tf wo are genuino Americans, those
coming over here cannot avoid an In
fection. We must illustrate the ideals
of justice and of . liberty. I
"When you ask a man to become
loyal to this government when he comes
to America, he thinks he must be loyal
to a few persons. But that is not our
ideal. ' We want him to be loyal to our
objects and ideals.
The ideal of America is not so much
that law should be created for the pur
poso of punishment as for the purpose
of instructing and guiding the people
as to the objects of America. That is
why so many hopeful reforms come to
grief. No law can work unless It ex
presses the sympathy of the community.
If only the minority favors It, it will
not work."

Cavalry Patrols Border
Watching for Coming of

Columbus, N. M., July 13. Heavy pa
trols of cavalry were on the alert along
the border west of here today to pre
vent a raid by a new baud of bandits re
ported gathering iu the San Simon val
ley. That the Mexicans may be led
by que of Villa's lieutenants, bent on
complicating relations between the Uni
ted States and Mexico through attacks
on border towns, is feared by army of
ficers. Customs line riders brought word
from natives who saw the band riding
eastward south of the border toward
Columbus, with the avowed intention of
making torays into tho United States to
raid rauche. Apprehension was felt to
day for the safety of ranchers In the
isolated stretches 'west of here. The
bandits are reported near the scene of
the murders of William Parker and his
wife a fortnight ago.
Tho new baud is said to be fully arm
ed and well mounted. Natives report
ed only 30 Mexicans in the band but
recruits may have joined since. The
leader, whose name was not learned, of
fered recruits the lure of loot on the

Dunn, aged 12, whose leg was horribly
stripped of flesh from a shark bite,
would recover. -
Physicians said the wound was sv
bad one. Great pieces of flesh wer .
torn from the bones and although the
youth bore the shock well, the wound
is of the sort that becomes infected
easily. : ,
Hundreds of men armed with rifles,
pistols, dynamite and all sorts of har
poons hunted ceaselessly along the Jer
sey shore today for the shark. Mata
wan creek was almost" dynamited out
of its course. It is now feared Lester
Stillwell 's body may" have been eaten
and that the shark came bach to
feast on human flesh after the attack,
since another of .those attacked by the
shark was-bitten as he was ondeavor
ing to bring the body to shore. "
State, aid in seeking the shark -will
be asked of Governor Fielder today.
Dread of further attacks is playing
havoc with the business of bath house 1
proprietors in all beaches nearby. The
bathers-apparently - reason that if a
shark swims up into the sluggish wat
ers of Matawan creek not more than
15 feet deep he will go anywhere.
The fishermen experts in and around
New York think there is only one man
killer shark but assuming their hy
pothesis to be correct the big fish has
shown an amazing faculty ltor - travel
and a boldness which does not match
with .-supposed facts as to the timidity
of 'sharks in general. A little over a
week ago Charles E. Van Sant of Phil
adelphia was attacked at Beach Hav
en, N. J., and killed. Five days later
on July (1, Charles Bruder at Spring
Lake, N. J., succumbed to terrible in

big fish against his leg, as he was
drawing out of the wnter at Wyekoff 'a

well was too far away and before he
could reach the dock, he was dragged

Whea Stillwell 's companions spread
the alarm in Matawan, W. Stanly Fish

sea, was among those who volunteered
to aid in searching for the boy's body.
Disregarding all warning, he dove re
peatcdly in the spot where the shark,
seized Stillwell. Finally he found the
mangled body and was bringing it to
short when he felt the shark turning
under him. Ho fought lustily with,
legs and feet, screaming for help, but
holding tight to Stillwell 's body. When
ho wus finally dragged into a boat, it
was seen his right leg had been literal
