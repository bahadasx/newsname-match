Herman Weiler and Dr. W. R.
Scott were over from Galena one
day last week. For the benefit
of Baxter people who may be
somewhat sore at Galena over
several matters and things, we
want to suggest that Herman
Weiler had nothing to do with
the matters which caused the
sore spots.
The News again appears as a
ten-page paper tuts week, bev'
eral of the live merchants are
using a great deal of space to in
crease trade in Baxter springs.
Of course, the other ones will
get some of the new trade that
comes to town, even u tney ao
. m
not spend a nickel to get it. At
some of the stores next Saturday
the people will have a chance to
fill up on first class lemonade free
of cost.
A trip up and down the alley,
back of the business bouses of
this city will reveal a condition
that in most place, would fill the
jail, and police courts. A state
fire marshal i. in Galena this
week, and we hope the fire chief
of this city will ask him to visit
Baxter Springs while he is in
this cart of the state. And if he
doe. he will cause a lot of insur
ance in Baxter Springs to be can
celed, if the trash pile, back of
the business houses are not
cleaned up.

COUNTY. KANSAS. JULY 13
Hou About Seuers.
The News has received many
commendatory words on the ar
ticle it published last week rela
tive to the need of sewers in Bax
ter Springs. All people who want
the town to go ahead and take
front rank among the good towns
of the country are in favor of
sewer.. All good town., in thi.
day and age, have .ewers. It is
next to impossible to increase the
population of a town with a class
of people that is desirable unless
that town ha." .ewers. Modern
civilization demand.. anltary con
ditions, and sanitary conditions
are impossible without a sewer
system.
Last week the News pointed
the way to get a sewer system in
thi. city. Let a petition be drawn
up and circulated and signed.
Then present the petition to the
city council, whose duty it is to
declare a benefit district. Then
a resolution i. passed by the
council declaring the installation
of a sewer system in that district
a necessity for the city. A con
tract is let for the sewers, and
they can be paid for by special
tax bills against the property in
bat district. A period of ten
years can be covered in the pay
ment All the city would be out
in the matter is the sewers that
cross the streetsand alleys, which
will not break the city up.
We have been told the city
council would not pass such a res
olution. We would like to see
a petition properly drawn ptesent
ed to the council asking for a
sewer system in the business dis
trict. After a sewer system is
built in the business district it
will not be long until more sewers
are built. Sewer building is con-
tagwua.- -All .the peojie want
sewers after the beauties and
conveniences are seen and under
stood.
A good sewer system in Baxter
Springs will go a long way to
ward increasing the population,
and a long way toward making
Baxter Springs a good place in
which to live.
Some fellows get busy and cir
culate a petition. The council
will not turn you down. Do not
be afraid of that.
