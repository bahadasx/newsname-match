STORM DAMAGES
COUNTY CROPS;
JUGGLES BOAT
Corn Fields Are Blown Down
North and South of Cape
Girardeau.
CAPE PARTY ON BOAT
FRIGHTENED AT WIND
Society Ladies Forced to Abandon
Game While Gale
Sweeps.
Much damage to growing crops was
done by the heavy storm which swept
across various sections of the county
yesterday. The storm struck only in
spots, but a light rain fell over this
section of the state.
South and north of the Cape the
storm reached serious proportions.
Corn fields were badly damaged in
some sections north of this city and
small buildings were blown down south
of the Cape.
The Str. Cape Girardeau, which
made an excursion trip to Commerce
and back yesterday afternoon, struck
the storm near Thebes and for thirty
minutes battled with the heavy gale.
The storm in this locality was accom
panied by a terrific electrical display,
which aggrevated the excitement on
the boat.
Several society ladies from Cape
Girardeau were givirg a party on the
boat when the craft drifted into the
windstorm. The storm broke with such
fury that the bridge game was halted,
but only temporarily. While the la
dies were badly frightened by the
storm, the party was resumed as soon
as the wind abated. Among thpse pres
ent were: Mesdames Phil A. Hoch,
William H. Harrison, H. C. Wasem,
Jack Cairns and others.
The storm that struck in the north
ern part of the county yesterday after
noon seemed to encircle the city. The
wind blew at a high rate as the storm
passed eastward to the river and at
Kelso, it was almost cyclonic in its
velocity.
The high wind was accompanied by
a drenching rain that amounted vir
tually to a cloudburst.
0. A-Knehans, former Circuit Judge
James A. Finch, C. N. Mozley of the
Cape and a lawyer named Smith of
Fornfelt, were in an automobile when
caught by the storm at Kelso.
At one time the wind blew so hard
that the machine was raised from the
road on one side and it stood balanc
ing on two wheels till a lapse in the
force of the wind allowed it do get
back on the road with all four wheels.
When this caper was pulled off by
the wind with their car, the occupants
hastened to anchor at a convenient
post and abandoned the machine for
the shelter of a nearby store building.
As they were driving at one place,
the wind tore down a large 30-foot
sign and hurled it across the road di
rectly in front of the automobile and
it barely missed striking the machine.
The rainfall continued to a place
about two miles north of Illmo, where
it became comparatively a light show
er such as fell in the Cape. The storm
was accompanied by a fall of several
degrees in the temperature after the
mercury had climbed yesterday to
more than 90.
MRS. STOUT HOME AGAIN
Returns from St. Louis Hospital
Excellent Health.
in
Mrs. John L. Stout, who underwent
a serious operation at St. Luke's Hos
pital in St. Louis six weeks ago, ar
rived home yesterday, accompanied by
Capt. Stout She has virtually recov
ered from the effects of the operation
and is in excellent condition.
Dr. Carroll Smith, a noted St. Louis
surgeon who operated on Mrs. Stout,
believes the source of her trouble has
been eradicated. In spite of the seri
ousness of the operation, Mrs. Stout
never had any temperature, which was
due, Dr. Smith said, to her excellent
physical condition.
Before coming home, Capt. Stout
took his wife to Peoria, 111., by boat
as a trial trip. On returning to St.
Louis, Dr. Smith found Mrs. Stout had
suffered no ill effects and gave per
mission for her to accompany her hus
band home. They arrived yesterday
morning on the steamer Cape Girar
Dog Days Here;
Don't Let Your
Pup Nibble You
Hoodoo Season Will Last
Forty Days and Nature
Will be Mixed up Fish
Get Lazy and the Swimmin'
Hole Is Poison.
The season known as "Dog Days"
opened yesterday and will continue
forty days.
"Dog Days" are not mentioned in
the almanacs, and as a matter of fact,
have no official standing with those
who make up the calendars, but there
are many people who note the arrival
of this season of the year with the
same degree of respect that they do
the spring or the autumn.
Fish quit biting, at least the best
of 'em do, during "dog days." Dogs
are supposed to carry a grouch around
with them, and if not properly watch
ed, will become afflicted with hydro
phobia.
If you notice your canine is frothing
at the mouth and snapping at objects
that are strewn in its way, get out the
family pistol, because your dog is
mad.
Those who have attempted to trace
the origin of "dogs days," are unable
to say definitely who discovered this
season of the year, but it is known
to turn the water in the old swimming
hole sour. Bubbles form around the
banks of the pond and the water be
comes poisonous.
Small boys, who spend their sum
mers splashing around in a hole of
water, are urged to keep on the land
for the next forty days. According to
the oldest inhabitants, including Col.
Matt Morrison, the goosebone weather
prophet, the water In the pools is not
safe for swimming, because the poison
that it is supposed to contain will turn
the smallest sores on the human body
into boils.
Chickens began to shed their plu
mage during "dog days" and the birds
refuse to sing that is, occasionally
they do.
Snakes are deadly in "dog days,"
and they are more vicious. The dead
ly reptiles, such as the rattlesnake and
the cotton-mouth lose their skins in
"dog days" and are as peevish as a
bachelor when he begins to lose his
hair.
"Dog days" is nothing less than the
hoodoo season of the year. People
who have watched for queer happen
ings during these forty days, say "dog
days" and black cats go together. If
an ebony colored feline crosses your
path, don't fail to cross your fingers
and expectorate through your teeth.
This is the only known method of re
moving the spell.
CAPT. LEYHE HAS DANCE
Cape Couples Dance Till Boat Leaves
at 10 O'clock.
After the arrival of the Str. Cape
Girardeau in the Cape last night from
the trip to Commerce in the afternoon,
Captain Leyhe issued invitations to a
private dance in the ballroom on board
the boat which was enjoyed till about
10 o'clock last night by several Cape
couples.
As the bell struck 10, the members
of the dance party were forced to hunt
the stage plank and get ashore, and
the steamer departed on the St. Louis
trip.
The members of the party were:
Miss Ruth Glenn, Miss Marie Weber,
Miss Jane Weber, Miss Grace Black-
ledg, Mrs. Walter Albert, Dr. F. D.
Rhodes, Fred A. Groves, Norvel An
derson, Walter Albert and Captain
Leyhe.

JURY GIVES MAN
$62.50 FOR HIS
HORSE-WHIPPING
Howard Lcvan Gets Jury's
Verdict Against Two
Blodge it Citizens.
WILLIAM McBRIDE AND
HARRIS DEFENDANTS
Gang Accused Levan of Window
Peeping as Cause for
Whipping.
A horse-whipping, while tied hand
and foot, by men who wore masks and
invaded his home after nightfall, yes
terday was considered worth only
$G2.."0 by a jury In the Scott County
Circuit Court who tried the 20,000
damage suit Howard Levan brought
against William McBride and Morris
Harris, both of Blodgett.
The members of the jury deliberated
for several minutes before they ar
rived at a verdict in favor of Levan,
the nian who had been whipped, and
fixed his damages at $62.50. The costs
also were charged up to the defend
ants in the case.
The horse-whipping occurred in
Blodgett last fall when a gang of men,
some of whom were armed, appeared
at Levan's home, took him from his
wife's arms, carried him to the yard
in front of his house and heat him.
After the whipping, Levan sought
aid of an attorney after ho believed he
had established the identity cf two of
the men in the horse-whipping gang.
McBride, who is the head bookkeeper
for the B. F. Marshall Mercantile Co..
in Blodgett, entered the Levan home
ahead of the remainder of the gang.
According to Levan's testimony yes
terday, McBride was armed and he
told Levan that he had come to pro
tect him from a gang of men who were
on their way to his home to whip him.
A few moments later, the door was
thrust open. McBride put up a short
scrap with the men and then Levan
was carried out for the whipping. Mc
Bride was unmasked, so that Lcvan
identified him as one cf the men ion
nected with the affair.
Harrs, who is cashier in a bank at
Blodgett, Levan said he identified by
a tatoo mark of a star on Harris' arm.
The suit for $20,000 against the two
men was field for Levan by Attorney
O. A. Knehans, who was assisted in
the trial of the case by Senator T. F.
Lane. Attorney A. M. Spradling of
Jackson, and Attorney Albert DeRaign
of Benton, were lawyers for Harrs and
McBride.
Levan testified in his own behalf and
after he had told his story to the jury,
he was cross-examined. The attorneys
for the defendants then got into the
record testimony seeking to show that
the reason Levan was whipped was be
cause of charges of window peeping
that had been made against him.
He was asked the question, and he
made a denial of the charge. Sprad- j
ling and DeKaign put on five witness
es to show facts concerning the char
acter of Levan, but at no time did
either defendant take the stand to
make a denial that he had taken a
hand in the whipping. The denial was
made for the most by inference by the
attorneys for the defendants.
At the close of the case, Knehans
and Lane offered an instruction to the
jury that a verdict for $1000 be order
ed by the judge, on the grounds that
no denial of the charges of horse-whipping
had been made, but rather the
character of Levan had been attacked.
Levan's attorneys told the jury that
the damages they wanted would be
reasonable if placed at $1000.
Last night it was suggested that the
damages that finally were allowed by
the jury virtually amount to the
money that Levan could have earned
in the two weeks that he was laid up
from wounds received in the whipping,
plus the doctor's bill.

JIMMIE THOMPSON
IS IN CANADA NOW
Cape Cement Plant Engineer
Writes From Belleville,
Ontario.
J. G. Thompson, known around Maw
Cooper's as "Little Jimmie" is in
Bellevill , Ontario, Canada, on a va
cation with his wife -d child. He is
visiting with relatives in that part
of Canada while he is having his vaca
tion at the Cape cement plant where
he is employed.
Friends of the Thompsons in the
Cape yesterday received postal cards
from him. Mr. Thompson's Darents
reside in Canada and he was educated
in that country before he came to the
United States. Before his arrival in the
Cape to work as an engineer at the
cement plant, he had experience in ce
ment plants in various parts of the
Middle West.
Some of his friends in the Cape yes
terday raised the question as to
whether or not he ever became natur
aliz?d as an American citizen while in
this country and would not be subject
to the call of Great Britain for Cana
dian troops.
A short time before he left the Cape,
Mr. Thompson said that he had re
ceived word from his father, saying
that virtually all the young men with
whom he had grown up at his Cana
dian home, his old school and class
mates, have joined the colors of the
allic1 ar,1lies and haYc been shiPnc1
to the European continent.
He said that at the beginning of the
struggle, when the first Canadian con
tingent of troops was recruited for
European service, scores of young men
had no intention of joining the colors.
However, as the call became more in
sistent, more of the young men went
and eventually a public opinion grew
up, he said, that virtually forced the
young men into the ranks of the Cana
dian troops.
Mr. Thompson received letters from
his father telling of the fortunes of
some of his classmates who had gone
to war. One of Mr. Thompson's closest
friends obtained a commission in the
first contingent of 12,000 Canadian
troops. He left as a second lieuten
ant. He was among the first to be gassed
by the Germans, was hauled out of the
trenches and sent home to stay. He
recovered and rctuned to the front and
the last that was heard of him he had
been advanced to the rank of a major.
He was one out of six men who sur
vived the 12,000 men sent in the first
Canadian contingent.
Heart disease was the cause of Mr.
Obcrmiller's death. He fell in the yard
at his home -and was picked up by his
wife and a neighbor whom she sum
moned to aid her. When a doctor ar
rived he was dead.
He is survived by his wife, three
brothers and a sister.

BANK TO ARBITRATE
ELLEGOOD RUMPUS
Will Buy Strip of Land or Wreck
Part of The
Building.
The terms under which the First
National Bank will arbitrate the Elie
good spite fence war in the dwelling
at Themis and Spanish streets, yester
day became known and at the same
time ,it was revealed that unless Mrs.
Mosella Elregood arbitrates on the
bank's terms, a part of the house will
he torn down.
When Mrs. Ellegoou was forced to
move from the house on the southeast
corner of Themis and Spanish streets
next to the Elks Club, she left a spite
fence for the tenants of the bank's
property to face.
The Ellegoods formerly owned the
place, but when it was sold out under
a $7500 mortgage held by the bank,
they lost possession oi the place and
after a suit in Common Pleas Court,
were ejected b ythe sheriff. However,
the house, when built, was placed two
and a half feet on the lot adjoining the
place in the rear. This lot is owned
by Mrs. Ellegood.
In the rear of the place, two feet
and v. half of the bank's house rests
on Mrs. Ellegood's property. When
she moved, she placed a line across
the end of the house with a warning
sign, notifying anyone who encroach
ed over the line that he would be pros
ecuted for trespass.
The officers of the bank were con
fronted with the proposition of get
ting a tenant who could either side
step the spite fence or be prosecuted.
They now propose to have a build
ing and wrecking contractor view the
situation, calculate the cost of the al
teration that would be necessary in or
der to make the house conform in size
to the amount of land available and
offer a bill of costs.
With this bill of costs, the bank
then will approach Mrs. Ellegood to
arbitrate. They will offer her the cost
of the alteration for the strip of land
two feet and a half wide that is nec
essary to furnish a bottom for the
house.
If this ultimatum is not accepted,
the bank will tear down that part of
the house and make the alteration,
rather than pay a higher price for
the strip of land.
It is roughly estimated that the cost
of the alteration will be $600.

HEALTH BOARD
ISSUES WARNING
ON PARALYSIS
People Can Fight Harder to
Prevent Epidemic Than to
Cure Disease.
GROWN :UPS MAY TAKE
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
Wacth Nose and Throat as The
Most Vital Spot-Also
Swat The Fly.
In order to prepare the people or
the Cape against a possible spread of
the nation-wide infantile paralysis epi
demic into this city, Mayor Kage and
members of the Board of Health yes
terday inaugurated a publicity cam
paign seeking to te!I the people what
is best to do in order to avoid the dis
ease.
"The proposition that an ounce of
prevention is worth more than a pound
of cure never has been more applicable
than at this time," Dr. R F. Wiehter
ich, president of the Board of Health
said last night.
"The people of the city may do a
lot to keep the disease from ever get
ting a start in the Cape and it is
through the press that they best may
be informed.
"I believe that this epidemic that is
raging in the larger cities will spread
to all parts of the United States before
it is stamped out or runs its course
late in the fall. For that reason, we
should prepare in the Cape to fight it
as much as if we had the disease in
our midst.
"I believe that if the disease be
comes prevalent enough about us, it
may be necessary to place a quaran
tine cn all trains and vehicles coming
to the Cape. Several years ago, when
we had a smallpox epidemic, the trains
were met by physicians who examined
every person who got off here.
"That is one step that we could take
in an extreme situation to avoid in
fantile paralysis."
A concise set of rules for those who
wish to avoid tiie disease have been
laid down as follows by a member of
the Health Board:
1 Let these rule3 apply to every
one. This form of paralysis may at
tack grown-ups as well as children.
2 Disinfect the nose and throat
daily by spraying with an antiseptic.
You take the disease through the nose
and throat and it is important to dis
infect those parts thoroughly every
day.
3 Eat nothing but cooked foods.
Cook fruit as well as all other foods.
The germ may be introduced in un
cooked food.
4 Keep away from large gather
ings of people especially the chil
dren. 5 Swat the fly hard and ir.nke
everything around the home hygien
ically clean. The cleaner, the more
secure.
6 The first moment you have a sus
picion of the disease's presence call a
doctor."
Symptoms of the diseae are found
in a severe headache accompanied by
a stiffening of the legs or pains in the
legs. These symptoms will be accom
panied by fever.
The germ may be present from 3 to
10 days before it makes its presence
kno'n. and a child who has the dis
ease may go to bed feeling perfectly
well at night and wake up in the
morning with an advanced stage of
the disease.
Although older people may have the
disease, it is prevalent amory? children
and babies have the majority of the
cases. The degree of contageon is
slight, but it is transferred by infec
tion through the nose. Cases should
be isolated as soon as they are found.
It is more important to guard
against the disease's appearance than
attempt to help a patient after he gets
it for medical science as yet has been
unable to do much to combat the dis
ease. The infantile paralysis first was sep
arated from other forms of paralysis
in 1840, and in the last ten years in
the United States there have been
many epidemics. The disease is prev
alent in this country and in Sweden.
In 1907 and 1908 in New York City
there were 2000 cases showing a mor-
