Washington, July 13. War's in

THE WAR TODAY
The British have retrained pos
session of Mametz wood after des
perate lighting. North of the
Somme river the British made
some progress in the Trone wood
and repulsed two attacks by the
Germans who are reported to hare
lost heavily.
South of the Somme the French
and Germans apparently are. rest
ing. The bombardment of Verdun
has not been lessened. The Ger
mans, following rip their success
in the region of Uamloup battery
have undertaken a strong offensive
toward Fort Souville, a position of
strategic importance.
The Germans have gained
ground at the intersection of
Flenry and Vaux roads.
On the eastern front there Is a

of Kovel and in Bukowina and
Galicia.
The Russians have been success
ful in Armenia against the Turks,
having captured Mamakhatum. M
miles west of the Enenim, the
objective of the Itnssian drive in
this direction.
The Italians report gains in the
Adige valley and the recapture of
positions on Monte ( orno. The
Austrians claim the Italians were
repulsed on Monte iU&to.
Vast Outlay
of Russians
Puzzles All
London, July 13, (12:05 p. m.) Re
covery of the Russian armies since
their defeats of last year and the ap
parently inexhaustible supplies of guns
and ammunition with which they are
provided continues to be a source of
wonder to military writers. At least
six great armies are engaged, against
the Austrians and Germans on Rus
sia's western front. All of them are
using great quantities of ammunition.
The forces under Grand Duke Nich
olas in Armenia and Persia have been
fighting vigorously against the Turks
for months. Early this week the grand
duke recaptured Mamakhatom, 50 miles
west of Erzerum.
Meanwhile the armies directly sotrth
of the Pinsk marshes are fighting a
pitched battle with the Austro-Ger-man
forces of General von Linsingen
along the line of the Stokhod river.
The Teuton have brought up very
strong reinforcements in the hope of
retaining possession of Kovel.
North of the Pinsk marshes the
fighting at present is largely with ar
tillery. In Galicia the Russian armies
are reforming for continuation of the
offensive.
In the west the renewed efforts of
the German crown prince at Verdun
temporarily are taking precedence in
the public mind over the battle of the
Somme. The attack just delivered oe
fore Verdun is the seventh great on
slaught with dense masses of troops
since the operations begun some five
months ago. The Germans have made
a slight gain but apparently this has
not lessened the confidence of the
French in their ability to hold fast.
They still have three solid lines of de
fense. The British are still engaged in clear
ing the Germans from fortified posi
tions which must be taken before the
general offensive can be renewed.
BIG FOREST FIRE

Guerneville, Cal., July 13. Forest
fires raging today in a canyon and

Marian ha1 made threats of suicide to

"If Orpet had committed murder

"The state, alleged that she made no
preparations which would indicate in

the lawyer."
"Gentlemen, suicides keep their in

Naval Bill Is
Up to Senate
Until Voted
Washington, July 13. The naval ap
propriation bill was taken up by the
senate today to be kept before it until
final vote is taken. The measure, as
reported by the naval committee, sub
stitutes eight capital ships the coming
year for the house's five and specifies
completion of the navy general board's
five year building program within
three years.
As it passed the honse the bill pro
vides for five battle cruisers and no
battleships and contains no provision
for a building policy extending into
the future. A program of four battle
ships and four battle cruisers for the
coming year and completion of the five
year program of 16 capital ships two
years earlier than intended was de
cided on by the senate naval commit
tee after conferences with Secretary
Daniels.
The three year program calls for an
expenditure of $588,180,576, of which
$315,836,843 is appropriated for 1917.
New construction in 1917 would cost
$110,726,000. The house bill called for
a total expenditure of $269,900,000 in
1917.
The general board's program pro
vides for this construction:
Ten dreadnoughts, (four this year.)
Six battle cruisers, (four this year.)
Ten scout cruisers, (four this year.)
Five fleet submarines, (none this
year.)
Fifty destroyers, (10 this year.)
Fifty-eight coast submarines (20
this year.)
Three oil fuel ships, (one this year.)
One repair ship, one hospital ship,
one transport.
Two destroyer tenders, (one this
year.)
One fleet submarine tender.
Two gunboats, (one this year.)
The house bill would bring the total
enlisted strength of the navy up to
65,000 but the senate committee in
serted a provision to provide for a
peace strength of 74,700 and to give
the president power to recruit the
navy's full strength to 87,000 in an
emergency.
TAKE LAST BOX OF
DYES OFF TEUTON
UNDERSEA CRAFT
Baltimore, July 13. Unloading of
the cargo of the German supersubma
rine Deutschland was completed early
today and the ship's rise revealed that
the estimates of her size have been ex
aggerated. Instead of being more
than 300 feet long and 30 feet wide, her
length is not more than 250 feet and
her width is less than 25 feet. ' Her
over-all draft figured submerged,
shows that she needs at least 32 feet
for complete submergence.
During the last hours of the unload
ing, the Tug Thomas F. Timmons
played the strong beams of a powerful
searchlight all about, sweeping the
waters, the shore lines and the
Deutschland's deck. A smaller pow
ered searchlight, which had been set
up on the motor boat Efco, reached
corners that were beyond the Tim
mons light.
The crew of the Deutschland decided
to turn over to the Red Cross fund the
$10,000 gift for valor from a New
Yorker.
Believes Captain Is His Brother.
New York, July 13. In the belief
that Captain Paul Koenig of the
Deutschland is his brother, George
Koenig, a hotel proprietor of this
city announced today that he would
go to Baltimore and invite the sub
marine captain to visit him here, and
to be entertained by representatives
of numerous societies of German--Americans.
George Koenig said he had not seen
his brother since 20 years ago when
the New York man left Hamburg, Ger
many, to seek his fortune in the Unit
ed States. He had had no knowledge
that his brother was in command of
the submarine. Five thousand mem
bers of German societies are prepar
ing to welcome Captain Koenig if he
is induced to come here.
Who Gets the Pyes Is Puzzle.
Local importers of dyestuffs said to
day that they have received no mani
fests indicating that the Deutschland
brought consignments to them.
It was reported that much of the
cargo was consigned to New Jersey
woolen and silk manufacturers but j-
ficials of silk mills in Paterson denied
this and said they understood the submarine's-
dyestuffs are consigned to
Count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, and that he will allot the
dyes to different firms.
Confer on Reports.
Washington, July 13. Reports of
customs and navy officers on the char
acter of the German submarine
Deutschland were the subject of a
long conference at the state depart
ment today between Acting Secretary
Polk and members of the government's
neutrality board. The department's
final decision will be announcde after
tomorrow's cabinet meeting.
Captain Hughes of the navy and
Collector Ryan and Surveyor Steele
of the Baltimore custom house, all of
whom examined the vessels say she is
an unarmed freight carrier.
Government officials generally are
satisfied that no legitimate objection
can be raised against granting all the
privileges of a peaceful merchant craft
to the Deutschland.
Every precaution is being taken,
however, particularly in view of rep
resentations made by the British and
French embassies claiming that Lhe
submarine is a potential warehip.

started up the creek about noon. Fiftv
or more persons were bathing. Captain
Cottrell hurried up the creek in his
motorboat to warn bathers, most of
whom left the waters immediately. The
