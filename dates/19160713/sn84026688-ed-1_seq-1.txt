There will he about fifteen ‘controls' I

set of these penalizations regarding
motor changes, repairs and alterations
has already been tentatively drawn tip,
forming, as nearly as possible, a con
sensus of the suggestions of entrants
and aeroplane makers.
Many Landings.
Whatever the route chosen, the dis

Kansas City, will not he more than
85" miles, and iu desert and mountain
ous countries in the West the distance
between controls will he limited to be
tween 175 and 275 miles.
“The contest committee,” says the
Aero club statement, “proposes this
limitation for the following reasons;
To prevent excessive Hying, making it
possible to every aviator to 11 y In this
initial long distance contest with safe
ty. and to approximate ordinary condi
tions to he met in every-day practice,
in aerial training, carrying mail, pas
senger enrrjing, etc.
"To give a larger number of con
trols and enable the population of im
portant centers in different parts of
the country to see the competing aero
planes and become familiar with the
present possibilities of aerial transpor
tation.
“To hold the contestants together as
far as possible.
"Each competitor must expend a
minimum aggregate of hours while his
machine is on the ground in the con
trols. These periods of 12 hours will
be called ‘resting lime.’ No competi

much time as lie likes at the starling
control, hut after once having been of
ficially started front any control, the

By SAIDEE BALCOM
(Copyright, ISIG. by VV, O. Chapman.)
Robert Laidlaw faced life, serious
and practical, at the ago of eighteen
and took up its burdens like the sen
sible young man that he was. A sud
den call from homo had torn him away
from pleasant student life, to find his
father dying.
“It's the break-up, Robert," his fath
er had the strength only to say, "life,
fortune, future for me. 1 have lost
about all I had. The doctor says I
have only a few hours to live. 1 saw
what was coming and I wrote to my
two brothers, James and Henry. Hero
are their replies. Choose for yourself,
Robert, between the two.”
"As to what, father?' inquired Rob
ert.
"As to which you will live with.
Both want you. Both are bachelors.
Uotli will leave a fortune. It Is a vast
relief to me to know that you will
not bo without prospects."
It was a week later and after the
burial of his father and the settlement
Tvo Found Employmenti Uncle
Henry."
of his poor business affairs, that Rob
ert sat down to read over the two let
ters his father had given him.
One was from James Laidlaw and it
read: "1 shall bo willing to practically
adopt you, but I want to stale the situa
tion clearly at the start so there are no
afterclaps. I have acquired a fortune
and my high position in life by fol
lowing a system. If you come to me,
I shull expect you to accept and live up
to its conditions. You are old enough
to have done with the follies of youth,
and my disposition Is such that at the
evidence of any delinquency or short
comings on your part I would dismiss
you promptly.”
"Rich, but selfish, as father has often
told me," mused Robert over this cold
formal epistle, and then his face bright
ened as he perused the second letter.
| "1 am a lonely old bachelor," wrote
Uncle Henry, "but not so old or per
verted that 1 do not realize that if you
are a live, up-to-date young man we
shall have a famous time together. It
will do me good to have a general
shake-up through such companionship
as 1 am sure yours will be. I under
stand that Brother James is also bid
ding for you. Well, he has the rocks,
and if you come with me you will have
to work, but I'll be your good friend
if you stick to me.”
In one moment Robert Laidlaw made
his decision. He wrote a note to Un
cle James thanking him for his kind
ness, but declining to make his home
with him. He Indited a second to Un- I
cle Henry, also thanking him and an
nouncing his intention of accepting
his kind offer.
All that Robert fancied this latter
relative to be he found him—a jolly,
careless old man living in an antiquat
ed mansion, reputed wealthy, but per
sonally insisting that his means were
as a dime to a double eagle compared
with the massive riches of Brother
James. From the start Robert felt
that his life had fallen in pleasant
1 places. He started out on his own
i initiative to find work the third day
I after his arrival.
"I've found employment, Uncle Hen
ry.” he announced that evening,
j “Have, hoy?” remarked his relative
with a quizzical gleam in his kindly
old eyes—"what line, now?”
"Down at the steel plant.”
i "You don’t mean common labor
i ing?”
"About that. See here, uncle, my
bent at college was along mechanical
I engineering lines and I've made up my j
mind to learn all there is about metals
i and construction from the ground up.”
It was not all work and no play with
I Robert. Uncle Henry never talked of
his riches, but Robert learned that ho
I was regarded as a substantial man in
a capital way. Besides his possible i
wealth, however, his long honorable I
standing in the community had made 1
him respected, and the old man was
in fact listed with the aristocracy of
the town.
Ue introduced Robert among good
people. There was a calculating ex
pression in the wise eyes of Mr. Laid
law after he had spent an evening
with the Carringtons.
“Social leaders, my boy!” he ob
served. "And that queenly Helena!
How did she strike you?”
“Cold as Ice,” replied Robert with
a slight laugh, “none of the genial
warmth of soul of some modest yet
gentle-hearted girl like —”
"Eh!” started Uncle Henry, as Rob
ert paused and flushed.
“Oh! like those natural friendly
girls In the office of the plant,” con
cluded Robert, generalizing.
“Your lofty Miss Carrington cut me
dead today, uncle,” reported Robert,
later in the same week.
“Oh, you must be mistaken,” remon
strated Mr, Laidlaw.
“Not at all, it was palpable and
meant. You see, I had my working
clothes on and the grime of honest
labor shocked her sensitive spirit.”
“H'm!" muttered the old man
thoughtfully, aud then be went to bis
lawyer. "See here, Hunter," he began
to tlie attorney, “I’m doing that boy a
wrong.”
“In what way?” was tho pertinent
query.
Mr. Laidlaw narrated bis story of the
disadvantages of menial employment
in the eyes of “the higher social set.”
He further deplored the arduous labor
which was hardening the bauds of bis
protege, the slow promise of Anal ad
vancement. The lawyer chuckled.
"Tired of the program, eh, already
that I laid out to make a real man of
your nephew?” he challenged. "What
you want to do—rear him iu the lap
of luxury and spoil him?”
“Well —er —you see—”
“No, you see! Laidlaw," Interrupted
the lawyer briskly, “Fve been studying
young Robert and I'm glad to observe
his sense, courage and fidelity to an
ideal. He'll work out right aud make
you proud of him If you leave him
alone."
"Yes, but he may make friends*
among the—well, the lowly—that may
be a detriment to him."
“What!” rallied the lawyer, "after
your proud-tempered Miss Carring
ton?"
“But suppose he should fall in love
with some poor girl?”
“Suppose ho did? Do you want to
spoil ills happiness? No, you go right
ahead on the course we have marked
out. Robert Is no fortune hunter or
he wouldn't have chosen you instead
of your brother, he would never have
risked catching an heiress by under
taking menial employment. He's gen
uine," concluded tho attorney. "True
blue ail through and ail of tho time.
Ho'll land right. Mark my words.”
There came a test. An unexpected
event transpired. James laidlaw died
and in a will he had planned to change
when his nephew refused to live with
him, but which he had neglected to do,
his sole heir was Robert.
“Now he'll go off on his own hook,
1 suppose." grumbled Mr. Laidlaw
to his lawyer; "no further use for me.”
"Wait and see," advised the law
yer.
It was a week later when Robert
came into the library and addressed
his relative.
“Uncle Henry," he said blunlly, "I
want you to accept half of the fortune
Uncle James left me. You were closer
to him than I am, and should by right
Inherit it. You are not rich —”
“Who told you that?” exploded tho
old man. "If I've hidden my wealth
from you, it was for a purpose. All
the same,” he said in a lower tone,
‘T’m glad to see that you have a loyal,
grateful heart.”
"It's a division, no matter what you
say,” declared Robert, "you see, if wo
could all live together—”
“We—aren't we? What you up to
now?” demanded the old man suspi
ciously.
"Why—you see. there’s a Nellie."
“And who is she?”
“Let me bring her around and see,”
suggested Robert, which he did.
She was not of the born princess
type—only a modest, retiring girl—but
Inside of five minutes she had wound
herself about the old man’s Ingenuous
heart just as she had done with Robert
Laidlaw.
Carrying the Law.
Very few of our lawyers carry the
green bags which were once a badge
of that profession.
"I think the sight of such a bag
once kept Joseph H. Choate from
coming to Philadelphia to make a
speech,” Mr. Conlen said.
Mr. Conlen and another lawyer had
gone to Now York to Invite the ex
ambassador to England to deliver an
address in Philadelphia. Mr. Conlen’s
companion carried a green bag, which
he laid upon Mr. Choate’s table, evi
dently to the great lawyer’s annoy
ance.
“What do you carry In that thing?”
he asked.
“I have some law books," the young
Philadelphia attorney replied.
“When I was a young lawyer," Mr.
Choate said rather coldly, “I was
taught to carry my law In my head."
And the invitation was declined.—

GREAT BRITISH FORT
ADEN ONE OF EMPIRE’S MOST
PRIZED POSSESSIONS.
By No Means the Least of Strategic
Polnta on the Way to India and
the Far East—Can Defy
Mighty Fleets.
Aden Is the unhappy gateway Into
happy Araby, and, moreover, it is one
of the foremost strategic points on
England’s trade route through the Red
tea to India and the Far East, says a
war primer Issued by the National
Geographic society, which tells of the
first stronghold on the London-lndia
route to withstand a severe attack by
the Turks. Due Arabian author saya
of the country behind Aden, that coun
try known as Arabia Felix: “fts in
habitants are all hale and strong, sick
ness Is unknown, nor are there poison
ous plants or animals; nor fools, nor
blind people, and tho women are ever
young; the climate is like paradise
and one wears the same garment sum
mer and winter."
Aden, however, where the British
and Turkish forces are opposing one
another, enjoys none of these advan
tages catalogued as inherent In Arabia
Felix.
Spread over its ragged hills of sun
made ash and cinder, sweltering,
gloomy, and unrelieved by vegetation,
Aden Invites little attention in peace
times. “Aden Is a valley surrounded
by tho sea; its climate is so bud that
It turns wine into vinegar in the space
of ten days,” complained one disap
pointed Arab traveler of the Middle
Ages. And in the centuries since his
visit the climate has not improved. In
spite, nevertheless, of the terrible heat
that gathers over Aden’s valley and
clings to its low hills and Its lack of
a good water supply, the place main
tains a reputation as a healthy one.
The town is built on desolate vol
canic rocks that constitute a peninsula
near the entrance to the Red sea. The
strait of Bab-el-Mandeb lies 100 miles
away; and Aden is the British Gibral
tar toward the Indian ocean that keeps
an eternal vigilance over the safety of
the rich English commerce that goes
this way. The British captured and
annexed the place on January 16, 1839,
since which time they have made the
place a most emphatic fortress, one
of the strongest anywhere in southern
Asia. Money and labor without stint
have been expended there to make the
city absolutely impregnable from land
and sea. Massive lines of defense,
strengthened by a broad moat, guard
the neck of the isthmus, and these de
fenses conceal powerful batteries. Tur
rets, hidden forts, mined harbors,
great naval guns, obstruction piers,
barracks, redoubts in solid rock, all are
elements In the Bt itish plan to guard
this southern end of their Important
trade route beyond all possible chance
of failure against superior and sus

Fortune In Waste Paper Basket.
The days when poor men may pros
pect for gold are pretty well past, but
it seems as though a substitute, per
haps less picturesque and exciting,
offers Itself In the waste paper baskets
of business corporations.
Not very long ago the Heming'vay
Paper Stock company purchased Bom
the banking firm of Townsend. Whnlen
& Co., in Philadelphia, a batch of old
correspondence and papers, to be used
as paper pulp. The price paid was S7O.
An employee of the purchasing firm
began going over the documents and
letters and discovered a great number
of old, foreign stamps. He reported the
matter to his employers and they or
dered him to go through the whole lot
and pick out every stamp that seemed
unusual. A vast number were col
lected and when shown to A. F. lier
kels, president of the Philadelphia
Stamp club, he appraised their value
at over |75,000, thus giving the firm a
profit of more than a thousand dollars
on each dollar of their purchase.

METHODOFFINANCE
HOW BANKS“MAKE" MONEY FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Little Story Explains the Operation of
National Institutions —Whole Proc
ess Resolves Itself Into a Mat
ter of Credit.
It would seem that after the bank
takes your money, protects It, pays It
back on demand or as you order, lends
you money, discounts your neighbor's
note for you, It would have nothing
else to offer in your behalf. But it
has—it "makes’’ money for you, and
incidentally makes money for Itself,
according to a writer In the Brooklyn
Eagle.
When you see the president or the
cashier of a bank signing his name to
a row of four crisp new bills (they al
ways come in sheets of four) you won
der what ho is doing, and what is be
hind it all. Wo will show you by
a simple illustration. Let us suppose
you want to borrow $ 1,000 and otter
your note to your banker. He knows
you, knows that you will pay, and
wants to accommodate you. He looks
at his books and says; "I can’t spare
the money. The law says I must have
fifteen cents out of every dollar I owe
my depositors in cash, or where I can
get it on. demand; and 1 have just
what the law requires. It I give you
credit for the note and lot you check
against It, I Increase my debts and
make my condition worse, for if I do
not pay you in cash I must stand ready
to do so.”
But being a resourceful banker and
knowing how, ho asks you to wait a
minute while he goes to his strong
box. He finds a government bond
which he bought a year ago when he
hail plenty of spare money, for cash,
and comes back smiling and says;
"Very well, in three days you can have
your money. I will turn this bond into
bank notes for you." So he sends
the bond to Washington, and in re
turn the government sends him 200
crisp new $5 bills, to be signed by
two odlcers of the bank, cut and hand
ed out to you.
The government keeps the bond as
security that he will redeem the notes
in "lawful money" on demand—that is,
pay greenbacks or gold for them if de
manded (but this is seldom done),
pays him interest on the bond and you
pay him interest on your note for the
use of bis notes, and both are satis
fied.
You see ( by this proposition he has
turned your notes into bank notes,
with himself behind It and the gov
ernment behind him. Your promise
wouldn't go very far from home; these
promises will. Everybody knows them.
They ara "money” and circulate
us such.
Now what has the banker done by
this process? He has furnished the
community as well as you with circu
lating medium, handy to carry, cheap
and satisfactory to all. He has taken
your credit and turned It into bank
credit. He makes money and you
take the money he has made and make
some money for yourself. It is a very
simple proposition, understood by few,
but practiced by many. It you don’t
fully understand It, ask your banker
to tell you more about It. This fea
ture of banking, however, is performed
in this country only by banks under
control of the federal government,
namely, the national banks and fed
eral reserve banks, but is a common
banking practice the world over, dif
fering in form but not in substance,
it being a universal function of the
bank to turn credit which Is unknown
into that which is known and will
therefore bo freely taken, and bank
note credit is the most common and
useful form.
Dyed Furs Cause Skin Diseases,
Cases of skin disease caused by
dyed furs have become so common
that Dr. George Manghlll Olson of
Minneapolis urges, in the Journal of
the American Medical association,
that the use of the dye called par
aphenylendiamin and known to the
trade as paramine, ursol, etc., be pro
hibited by law. All the cases report
ed are traceable to furs dyed brown
or black with this dangerous dorlva
tive of aniliu.
The trouble comes generally on the
neck where the fur collar has been
in contact with the akin, and appears
often after the fur has been wet by
rain, snow or the breath of the wear
er, or after the wearer has had a close
shave. The bjack pony coats worn
by women are the worst offenders, as
all of them are dyed with parapheny
lendiamiu. Its presence can generally
be detected by examining the roots of
the hairs, which will show here and
there an unnatural brick-red color.
Battlefield Made Out of Old Money.
There is a stretch of plate-glass win
dows long enough to accommodate
Cully 100 persons at No. 411 Fifth ave
nue, where the American Red Cross
has its rooms, and usually there are
100 persons with noses flattened
against the windows, looking in at
the young women volunteers, busy
handling packets.
Nearly every young woman la point
ed out as this or that heiress a dozen
times a day.
Just inside there la a model of a
battlefield, made of macerated United
States currency, furnished by the
treasury department. The model
shows trenches and troops.
One man who inspected It said he’d
bet it took, more than ten million dol
lars tu macerated money t,> make the
model.
