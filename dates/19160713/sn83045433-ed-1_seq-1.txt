Jersey Coast.
(37 the Bus Newe Sewytee.)
Matawan. N. J.. July 12-A man-sat.
Ing shark swam through Raritan Bay
and up the Matawan Creek this after
noon. killed a boy swimmer, mangled a
man so badly that he died two hours
later in a hospital, and savagely at.
tacked a second boy bather. taking away
nearly all the back of a leg.
The dead boy is 12-year-old Lester
Stillwell. His body had not been re
covered at a late hour tonight, although
searching parties with dragging irons
and dynamite hunted long and thoroughly
for it.
The man. attacked as he was making
a heroic endeavor to rish up the body
of the boy after the shark had dragged
him down, was Stanle Fisher. a popular
young man of this place. His right leg
was torn, and he was so weak after his
removal to the Mrnmouth Memorial Hos
pital at Long Branch that the surgeons
did not dare to amoputate it. Death re
sulted from loss of blood.
The third and more fortunate victim
of the monster's afternoon's work was
10-year-old Joseph Dunn. a summer
visitor here. who is said to live In New
York. He is in St. Peter's Hospital. The
lower part of hit !- is missing. but the
doctors hope to save his life.
Young Lester went hathing with Albert
O'Hara. Frank Clowes and other boys
near his own age, at Wyckoffs dock,
about A0 yards from the mouth of
Matawan Creek, which is about fifty
feet wide. O'Hara got a glimpse of what
he supposed to be a log on the surface
of the water and was startled to see the
thing start towards him. He was near
the dock and reached it in a few strokes.
As he was pulling himself up a shark
attacked him Screaming he was pulled
under the surface.
The fact that several sticks of
dynamite, exploded under the water,
failed to bring his body to the surfate
leads to the belief that he was entirely
devoured by the man-eater.
An hour after the tragedies, not a
person was to he found in the water
from Raritan Bay to Matawan.
An effort will be made at once to
seeure State aid to hunt down and de
stroy the shark, or sharks, which have
caused so many deaths in water hitherto
Lonsidered absolutely safe.

Stubborn resistance was offered by the

Lnt1c Some officials even regard it as
athreat on the part of Gerinany to sik

The threat to resume submarine war
fare Is based on the apparent inactivity
of the United States government in deal

No official notice is being taken of the
threats. In fact it ha been publicly
stated by Secretary Ieong that 6r
