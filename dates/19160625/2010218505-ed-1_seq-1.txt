(By Associated Press.)
Sari Antonio, June 24.-The force of the tenth cavalry tinder
Captain Boyd succeeded in breaking through the Mexican lines at
Carrizal, according to a message tonight from Pershing to Funston,'
but whether any made their escape is yet unknown. Troop C, un
der captain Boyd, took the ditch in which the front line of the Mexi- j
cans was entrenched and charged into the towri of Carrizal. Troop
K, under Captain Morey, charging with troop C, was outflanked ahd
took refug?; in an adobe house where theyTought under cover. .
' This news came to Perching by a courier from! Major John M. Jen
kins commanding one of the relief squadrons sent out by Pershing.
Jenkins said he found four more troopers at San Luis ranch. They
however were horseholders and did not see,the^ fiiiish of the fight
Their stories, however, bore out previous reports that an att?ck was !
-^jftpitrvoked. - r Pershlhg saf? hr?^
irten still unaccounted for had been, captured. This is taken to m??ri
that h? betl?vfes1 Morey's men have been wiped out Pershing; re- j
ported that the troops showed the greatest courage. Jenkins' cbm-<
mand tonight is "hasteningtoward Carrizal and another relief squad
ron under Major Robert L. Howse is daily behind him., ' .
Captain Boyd was killed in the final rush, which captured the
Mexican entrenchments. According to men found at San Luis ranch,
wlten last seen troop C was: being led into Carrizal ' by Lieutenant
