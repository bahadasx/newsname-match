REPORT OF FIGHT AT CARRIZAL
SENT TO
MEXICAN GENERAL TREVINO AT CHIHUAHUA SAYS
AMERICANS ARE LEAVING BASE AND ISSUES ORDER'
TO ATTACK UNLESS THEY RETREAT.
'They'll Get the Same as at Carrizal," Said Trevino, Carran
Commander, Who Recently Issued Orders to Pershinr ot
to Move Troops South, East or West of Present Base- re
vino Says all of His Subordinates will Stick to Hi -All
Americans Said to Have Returned to Field Base., xcept
Forty Troopers and Three Officers Sixteen Men Picked
up Near Santa Maria, Who Were Horseholders During
Carrizal Engagement Tell Stories Almost Identical with
Others of Carrizal Fight and Indicate Almost Complete
Annihilation of Two Companies Engaged in Fight.
San Antonio, Tex., June 24. The
force of the Tenth Cavalry under
; Captain Boyd succeeded in breaking
through the lines of Mexicans under
Gomez, at Carrizal, according to a
message tonight from Pershing to
Funston, but whether any of them fi
nally were able to escape is un
known. Boyd's men of Troop C took
the ditch in the front line, where
the Mexicans were entrenched,
charging through the town of Carri
zal. Troop L, under fAorey, also
charged but were outflanked and
forced to take refuge in an adobe
house. They at least had a chance
to defend themselves from cover but
the ultimate fate is as unknown as
the remnant of Boyd's command.
This news came to Pershing by
courier from Major John M. Jenkins,
commanding the squadron relief ex
pedition sent from Cononia Dublan.
Jenkins said also that he had
found five members of Boyd's com
mand at San Luis ranch. They al
so were horse holders, as were the
other stragglers, who have been re
ported... They did not see the finish
!of the fight, but their stories con
firmed that of the others that the
attack was opened by the Mexicans
without provocation.
Pershing said he did not believe
that the thirty-eight men still un
accounted for had been captured.
This is taken to mean that e feared
that Mrey had been unable to hold
out against the overwhelming odds,
even from the adobe house, in which
they sought shelter, and had been
killed. He hoped however, that
they are holding out and Jenkins'
command is speeding to their relief.
Major Robert L. Howse with a sec
ond squadron of the relief expedi
tion is one day behind Jenkins and
pressing hard tq overtake and sup
port him.
J Pershing has sent provisions and
supplies for the wounded to meet
Jenkins and Howse on their return
march.
I Will Demand Release of Men.
San Antonio, Tex., June 24. Gen
eral Funston today urgently request
ed Washington to demand the release
Of the American soldiers taken as
prisoners at Carrizal and held at
;huahua. He. pointed out that
' Caminza has no basis to hold them
because war between the two coun
tries has not been declared. Hei
believes Carranza should be made
(o disavow the act of General Go
mez, who was killed in the fight.
No further news of the fate of
Captain Boyd has been received, but
Funston pointed out that the strag
glers' stories all coincided that the
Americans were treacherously at
tinted. Funston hopes that Cap
lain Lewis Morey, who was reported
ft- wounded, wifl be found in such
Condition that he will be able to give

ing, where the mobilization will be

tically all of the companies will have

ans in this city next month unless
the booze peddlers were put out of
commission and a strict watch kept
for any floating boot leggnr that

RELATIONS AT BREAKING POINT;

BELIEF IN WASHINGTON THAT AMERICAN CALVARY
WERE MASSACRED AT CARRIZAL CAUSES THE
OFFICIALS TO PLAN RETALIATION.
While Washington Officials Will Not Discuss the Mexican Sit
uation, it is Known that if Carranza Accepts Responsibil
ity for the Act It Seems Certain Wilson Will Order the
Occupation of Northern Mexico as Soon as the American
Troops can be Assembled Further Reports from Persh
injf will be Awaited Before Decision is Made News that
Central American Powers are Preparing to Offer to Me

to Mediate, as Far as United States' Policy is Concerned.
enough to violate the law were on

The result was instantaneous. The
locks and bars on all suspicious doors
were put in place, the shades drawn
and a noticabie absence of many who
heretofore slipped out a little of the
juice of the forbidden fruit.
A half million dollar payment is
pending contingent upon this
order and the officers are going
to se that the mony is put into
circulation here.
Autos Collide.
A Cadillac, driven by Porter Craig,
and a Saxon, driven by "Skeet" Mar
tin, came together at the corner of
Second aveDue and Vorth Washing
ton street yesterday afternoon and
both cars were considerably the worse
for the experience. The Saxon lost
a front wheel and the Cadillac was
"toting" a twisted bnmper when they
were pried apart.
This is another case where some
one was to blame for not being in
the right territory and observing the
traffic laws of the city.

others at Camp Whitman, Bocknian,
Washington, June 24. Relations be
tween the United States and the de
facto government In Mexico are close
to the breaking point as a result of
the apparently well founded belief that
the American cavalry was massacred
by theCarrancistas at Carrizal.
Secretaries Lansing and Baker held
conferences with Wilson this morn
ing and it is known that drastic re
taliation is considered. Neither Lan
sing nor Baker would discuss the de
velopments. If Carranza accepts responsibility
for the act, it is considered virtually
certain that Wilson will order the oc
cupation of northern Mexico, as soon
as the American forces can be assem
bled. However, further reports from
Pershing are being awaited before a
decision is made. s
Will Reject Mediation.
Washington, June 24. News that
some of the South and Central Ameri
can countries, including Ecuador and
San Salvador, are preparing to Initiate
offers of mediation between the United
States and Mexico, drew from high
officials today a strong intimation
that the United States is engaged only
in defensive protection, and considered
.there is nothing to mediate, so far as
tnejponcy ot tnis government is con
cerned. (CONTLXUH) ON PAGE KiaHTl
