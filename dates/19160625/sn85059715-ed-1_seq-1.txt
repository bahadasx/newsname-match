WASHINGTON, June 24. A per-'
emptory demand that General Currant*
repudiate the attack on American
troops at Carrieal nud immediately
release all captured American
j soldiers was understood tonight to be;
the next step in the Mexican crisis
now contemplated by the Washington
government.
Failure to comply with either demand
undoubtedly would result In'
the "grarest consequences" foretold
In Secretary Lansing's recent noto to
ihe defacto government.
Awaiting Finn! Report.
Formulation of a communication ,
nwaited a fln.il report from General
Pershing on the Carrixal incident.
Tending its receipt the war department
pressed urgently today it' offorts
to reinforce strongly the border
patrol and prepare for any eventual!ty
Full information from American
Bources as to what happened at Cnrriz&l
was still lacking, and the long
delay in finding additional survivors
of tho tight was regarded as an ominous
sign. No American officer may
survive. In that event action by the
' 1'nlted States probably would he
based on reports already received
from stragglers.
Trapped and Massacred.
Aside from the stragglers, the
American dead reported by Mexican
authorities, and the prisoners in Mexican
hands, more than a score of men
remained unaccounted for out of
Captain Boyd's little detachment of
negro troops. Without exception the
reports of the stragglers indicate that

Some hope persisted tonight that a
few of the communij loft a foot in !
the desert when their horses stam- i
peded under the Mexican Are, may
have dug themselves in somewhere
in the country west of Carrizal. and
be waiting for relief. General Pershing's
cavalry supports were Hearing
the scene of the tragedy and already
bad picked up n number of survivors,
according to lat? reports from the
border.
Concerned with Threat.
| OAlcials were plainly concerned ,
with news despatches from Chlhua-1
liua, saying that General Jacinto Tro- j
vino, the Mexican commander, had
threatened to attack American columns
reported advancing from the
field base toward San Antonio and
OJcallento if they did not Immediately
retreat. Another battle at this'
time might preclpitutc general hostil
mes.
Rumors that the Carmnza government
was seeking mediation through
other Latin-American nations came j
from inany quarters today. The ac-1
tivity of Eleseo Arredondo. the
Mexican ambassador designate, lent
weight to the reports. Private advices
from Mexico City also continued
to Indicate that General Carranza
still hoped to find a way to evade
the storm his policy has aroused.
Nothing to Mediate.
No offers of mediation reached the
j state department from any source.
, Administration officials held that
they have nothing t?> mediate,
j Under these circumstances it was
Intimated on high authority that efforts
toward preservation of peace
concerning the initiation of which
the minister of salvation was authorized
today to confer with his diplomatic
colleagues, could go no further
than an attempt t?? persuade
g- General Carranza to change his atti{^rttide
toward the determination of the
United States to protect its people
and territory. Ambassador Naon. of
Argentine, who was a leader in thtf
movement to recognize the Oarranza
de facto government during the
Pan-American conference?; .as to Mexico,
Is understood to have advised
his government last night, that the
circumstances did not lend them-.
Selves to a mediation proposal at this
time. He came here yesterday from
New York and saw diplomatic and
state department officials and- returned
to Washington again late tonight.
A report today that General Car
ranza and his cabinet had prepared
a reply to the laat American note rejecting
his demand that American
troops be withdrawn from Mexico.
The report said It would be published
In Mexico City, but It did not

Definite and important gains have
been scored by the Germans on the
