Virginia Hankers* Association to-ijnv
ratified a resolution looking to the
enactment of .1 State law permitting
a contract rate not exceeding S per

The recommendation was reported by

prevail, and only the raising of the

will correct this condition.
The resolution was adopted after a
short debate over scattering opposition.
Jt directs the president of the associa

members, two from each of the five
bank irroups. one to be an officer of a
national and the other an efneer of a

to take steps to secure the enactment

Shortly before final adjournment,
upon the motion of J. F. Jtison. of Dan
ville. the convention adopted a resolu
tion condemning that portion of the
n..\v check-clearing system proposed by.
the Federal Reserve Board affecting
country items. The resolution is In
this language.
"Resolved, That it is the sense of this,
association that the provisions of the
Federal reserve law which contemplate
the ultimate collection at par of coun-]
try items, form an unwise and unneces- ^
sar.v featuie of that law, atul that the
Senators and Representatives from this
State he requested to use their efforts j
to secure an amendment of the law in j
this particular, eliminating this feature!
therefrom, and that, in the meantime.!
the. Federal Reserve Board be requested i
not to take action looking to the en- ;
forcement of said provisions."

collection plan, the bankers listened |
with Interest to an able defense of the;

of the north, has ordered troops at

While information concerning these

of twenty-four hours, it is assumed

to the strength of the American col

to rescue the survivors of the Tenth

Army officers here also pointed out
that the column headed for Ojoealiente,
about thirty miles south of Carrizal,
probably is composed of the troops
