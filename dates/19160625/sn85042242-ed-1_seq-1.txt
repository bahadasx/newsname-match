Mexican Dead Are Buried Imme­
diately, but Americans
Remain Exposed.
CAiRRANZA LOSSES WERE
HEAVIER THAN REPORTED
Low Estimate Placed on Mexican
Dead for Political
Purposes,
El Paso, June 24—'Bodies of the
American soldiers killed in the Car
Tizal battle are still umburied on- the
battlefield, according to French and
Mexican refugees, who arrived in
Juarez today- They asserted the Mex­
ican dead were buried immediately
after the fight, but that the American
bodies had been left lying exposed to
the elements.
The arrivals also said that the Car­
ranza losses were much heavier than
the Mexican reports show, which
placc the casualties at fourteen.
Carranza leaders frankly admit, they
6ai$, that, the low estimates were
made public for the political purpose
of impressing upon the masses of the
Mexican people that the first clash be­
tween American and Mexican troops
had resulted in "a great Mexican vic­
tory."
,lt, is,. jtpjtaleA PMt. that '2:3. Mexicans
ivere buried near the battlefied after
the engagement, as many more ibodfes
including that of Felix Gomez, the
stein general, were taken to Chihua­
hua City, and two stock cars were
loaded with wounded, several of whom
h$ve ,died since in the Chihuahua City
hospital.
Carranzistas donned the uniforms
of the American soldiers slain in tho
battle.
Another story which is being spread
through northern Mexico for political
purposes, as the refugees said, is that
a number of negro soldiers of General
Pershing's command, "because of the
continued abuse to which they were
subjected, have been deserting to the
Carranza forces." These stories are
believed to have had their origin in
the fact that two negroes were cap­
tured about a week ago in Chihuahua
City.
Offers Complete Amnesty.
general Alvaro Obregon, Mexican
minister of war, has offered complete
amnesty to persons who have opposed
the government, providing they lay
down their arms and join in combat­
ting an American invasion, which he
says seems imminent, according to an
official dispatch to the consulate to­
day. Those who do not will be out­
lawed.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Aguilar
declares his country was not respon­
sible for the Carrizal incident and the
integrity of the nation will be defend­
ed, at whatever cost.
Break Through Mexican Lines.
The forces of the Tenth U. S. cav­
alry, under Captain Charles T. Boyd,
succeeded in breaking through the
lines of the Mexican force under Gen­
eral Felix Gomez at Carrizal, accord­
ing to a message from General Persh­
ing to General Funston tonight, but
whether any of them escaped is un­
known.
Captain Boyd's men of troop took
the ditch in which the front line of
Mexican troops were entrenched, and
charged through into the town of Car­
rizal. Troop L, under Captain Lewis
Morey, charged with the troop, but
were outflanked and were forced to
take refuge in an adobe house. They
had a chance to defend themselves
from cover but their ultimate fate is
unknown, ar. is tl at of remnants of
Captain Boyd's troops.
State of War Exists.

here has been construed as a declara­

To the nortli, German troops in in­

material progress.
Gains at Verdun.
Definite and substantial gains have
been made by the Germans at Ver­

the further claim that much of the

captured in subsequent counter at­

The Italians have made futher ad­

elsewhere they have withstood at­

Carrizal Incident Believed to Be
Merely Signal for Series
of Attacks.
GEN. PERSHING'S FORCE
TOO STRONG FOR ENEMY
Carranza Troops Tried Move to
Surround Punitive Expedi­
tion, but Were Too Slow.
El Paso, Texas, June 24.—Appre­
hension that battles may be in pro­
gress tonight between American and
Mexican troops in at least two places
in northern Chihuahua gripped the
border tonight.
American columns were moving in
the direction of San Antonio and Ojo
Calientes, while General Jacinto Tre
vino, commanding the army of the
north has ordered troops at adjacent,
points to attack Ihem if they do not
retreat immediately.
While information concerning the
movement readied here today from
Chihuahua City, additional advices in­
dicated that General Trevino'sscouts
reported the approach of the Ameri­
cans yesterday and his orders were
issued immediately. With a lack of
24 hours, it is assumed here that it
is probable that the opposing forces
may have met..
Army officers here also pointed out
that the columns headed for Ojo Cali­
entes, about 30 miles southwest of
Carrizal, .probably are composed of
the troops surviving the engagement
there and the two squadrons of the
Eleventh Cavalry sent, to reinforce
them. Mexican authorities content
themselves with asserting that the
strength of the commands dispatched
to meet them is adequate.
Pursuit of Bandits.
It is believed here that the Ameri­
can command advancing in the di­
rection of San Antonio, "0 miles
southeast, of Namiquipa, may be in
pursuit of bandits.
While the lack of definite infornfti
tion begets apprehension, military
men point out that General Pershing,
with General Trevino's threat and
the Carrizal fight before him. undoubt­
edly has taken steps to protect de­
tachments he sent out, and prepara­
tions have been made to reinforce
the American columns if necessary.
A suggestion that the Carrizal fight
i» but an incident of what is planned
as a general attack on the American
expeditionary command was received
today from General Pershing's head
quarterS. The report points out thai
the strength of the Americans deter­
red the Carranzistas.
Support is lent to this belief by
the redisposition early in the week of
all the Carranzista troops in western
Chihuahua. Military officers here, who
are inclined to placc some credit in
the report, point out that at that time
The semicircular line of the Mexicans
which had stretched around General
Pershing's command for some weeks
began to close in, evincing a distinct­
ly hostile attitude.
However, General Pershing redis
posed his troops, offsetting the Car­
ranza movement, presenting to them
a compact, prepared fighting unit.
The accepted belief is that Mexican
leaders realized they could not hope
under such circumstances to cope
with the Americans and abandoned
the general plan. General Felix Gom­
ez, at Carrizal, however, carried out
what is believed to have been one of
the pre-arranged details.

RELIGIOUS SERVICES AT
FARGO.
JFargo N.„ D., June 24—Relig­
ious services, held tonight in front
of the armory attended by mili­
tiamen and several thousand resi­
dents, marked the last night of
the Fargo company in this city.
Led by Dean Kloman of Gethse
mane cathedral, the service was
intensely impressive, conveying to
the boys and men who leave to­
morrow for their mobilization
camp, realization of the stern du­
ties that lie before them. The reg­
imental band of Lisbon and regi­
mental hospital corps of that city
arrived here tonight and will de­
part with Fargo early in the
morning.
Co. A, with iilks' band heading the
procession, will leave the armory at
10 o'clock this morning and march to
Fort Lincoln, the mobilization camp
of the First Regiment, North Dakota
National Guard.
This hour was set as the one at
which citizens of Bismarck could best
set the boys off. There will be 78
men in line, with Capt. A. 'B. Welch
commanding. The company will be
the lirst to reach the camp. The
others will arrive this afternoon slid
be taken direct to the fort.
Preparations were completed yes­
terday to receive the troops. A squad
"from Co. A marked off the company
reservations, pipes were laid for wa­
ter, and everything is ready for theHj
to pitch their tents as soon 2S they
arrive.
Major Tyler Here.
Major Tyler of the engineer corps
of the United States army, who has
been detailed as mustering officer at
Eisniarck, arrived yesterday, but. de­
clared that he could not tell when
the troops would be mustered in.
The board of control and the board
of regents, after a conference yester­
day with Governor Hanna. announced
that the places of all state employes
and teachers enlisting would be kept
open for them. It was also decided
to let the-troops while here use the
street car line without pay when in
uniform.
Will Vaccinate Men.
All of the men will probably be
vaccinated against typhoid fever be­
fore leaving North Dakota. The vac­
cine has already arrived.
All Bismarck has responded enthusi­
astically to the suggestion of special
decorations. The Commercial club
put up several streamers over Fourth
street, W. Wasley being in charge.
Practically every business house dis­

MEXICAN TREACHERY
Columbus, N. M., June 24.—Trapped
and fighting against heavy odds, the
troops of the Tenth cavalry, engaged
at Carrizal on Wednesday, charged
twice, directly into the jaws of the
ambush which the Mexicans had laid
for them. With bullet wounds in his
arms and shoulder, Captain Charles
T. Boyd, the commander, remained in
the saddle, leading his negro troopers
until they had captured the concealed
Mexican machine gun trench, when he
fell mortally wounded with a bullet
through the eye. This was the jist
of the first detailed account of the en­
gagements from American sources
which was brought to General Per­
shing today by Corporal Greene, of
Troop C, who was at Captain Boyd's
side until he fell.
Flankeu On Both Sides.
The Americans were flanked on
both sides by the Carranzistas who
had partly surrounded the little com­
mand during a conference between
General Felix Gomez, the Mexican
leader, and Captain Boyd. In front
was a concealed Mexican machine
field gun trench, from which a stream
of leaden death was unexpectedly
poured into the American ranks-
Corporal Greene said that Captain
Boyd, although wounded in the arm
and shoulder by the first fire, immed­
iately gave the order to charge and
the detachment rode at top speed
through a hail of ibullets, directly at
the trench, capturing it just as the
American leader fell. The Mexicans
retreated to cover in a nearby
shack. Lieutenant Henry Adair as­
sumed command and ordered a sec­
ond charge, which drove through the
shack, scattering the Mexican com­
mand. Greene said he did not see
Lieutenant Adair after this charge
and believed he lost his life in it.
Meanwhile, Captain Lewis S. Morey,
commanding troop, which also was
partly surrounded during the parley,
occupied another adobe house with
his men, from which he engaged a sec­
ond detachment of the Mexicans.
Thirteen Killed.
While it is assumed that Captain
Morey was wounded in the fight, neith­
er Corporal Green nor any of the oth­
er survivors reaching here knew any­
thing of the outcome of this part of
the battle.
It is believed here, however, that
he may have collected the shattered

Seeking Mediation.
Rumors that the Carranza govern­
ment was seeking mediation through
other Latin-American countries came
to the state department today. Ad­
ministration officials hold they have
nothing to mediate. A mediation plfcn
resting on a military status quo dur­
ing negotiations would prevent pur­
suit of raiders beyond the border to
break up bandit organizations before
they become dangerous. And it is
for this purpose General Pershing's

recognize the Carranza de facto gov­

conferences as to Mexico, is under

meent last night that the circum­
stances did not lend themselves to a
mediation proposal at this time.
A report reached here today that
General Carranza and his cabinet had
prepared a reply to the last American
note, rejecting his demand that Amer­
ican troops be withdrawn from Mex­
ico. The report said it would be pub­
lished in Mexico City tomorrow, but
it did not say when it would be sent
here, and officials were not inclined to
credit it. Special Agent 'Rogers, at
the Mexican capital has reported in
abilty as yet to give any ihUing as to
what may be expected from Carransa.
Hostile Answer Expected.
If a reply has been prepared in the
brief time the Carranza government
has had to study its position, officials
are inclined to believe it foreshadQfrs
a hostile answer.
Private advices today still pictured
the position of General Carranza'as
strongly inclined toward a peaceful
