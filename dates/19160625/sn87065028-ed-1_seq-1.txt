40 member of the Caledonia Rif tesi.
It was Impossible for this company
to secure C8 men, the number neces
sary to form an independent com
mand, and Adjutant-General Erie
Scales, of the Mississippi National
Guard, irsued an order providing
that the Caledonians be included in
the Columbus Riflemen. The order
also provided that G. B. Egger, enp
tain of the Caledonia Rifles, be com-
- missioned as first lieutenant of the
newly formed company, and this ac
tion reduced First Lieutenant John
Lawley, of the Columbus Riflemen
to the rank of second lieutenant and
deft Second Lieutenant Ed Miller
, without a commission. These two
gentlemen and their friends did not
much like the new arrangement, but
decided to abide by General Scales
action. - ' .

The ceremonies include i an ad

the flag was presented to Capt. Mul

ny, by Miss Jennie Sharp. Mi
Sharp was assisted in bearing the
' flag, which was supported on a

for these young ladies.
A committee of patriotic ladies
and gentlemen managed the affair
' ,for the Riflemen, and the success
which attended the occasion was
largely due to their eforts. The gen
eral committee on arrangements
consisted of Messrs. V. B. Imes,
Carroll Hackleman and S. B.
Street, Jr., while the ladies com
mittee was made up of Mesdames Z.
P. Landrum, Chas. Hays, Claude
Ayres, and Mr. Irvin Kaufman was
in charge of the decorations. Mr. J.
G. Weatherly, the efficient secretary
of the Chamber of Commerce, and
other patriotic ladies and gentlemen
also rendered valuable assistance,
At 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon
the company lined up in front of
the city hall, and each member
, was presented with a Bible. These
Bibles were presented to the sol
diers by citizens of . Columbus, and
were secured through the activities
of a committee headed by Rev. W
S. Slack, rector of St. Paul's Epis
copal church, and Mr. T. W. Harris,
a leading hardware dealer and mem
ber of the city council. Rev. Slack
presented the Bibles to the soldiers,
ana delivered an earnest and ap
propriate address.
The ladies on the committee to
raise funds for the purchasing of
flag for the Columbus Riflemen
failed to find a number of people
at their homes the past week, and
they have made a request that if
there are any ladies who desire to
contribute to this fund they will
please leae their money either at
the Chamber of Commerce or with
Mrs. Z. P. Landrum. ,

THI FATALITY II
FAMOUS LAWLER CASE
SHERIFF PHILLIPS, 'BELIEVING
HE IS UNDER SUSPICION,
KILLS SELF.
Huntsville, Ala., June 23. Sher
ff Robert Phillips, of Madison coun
ty, shot and killed himself at the
county jail here late today the
second suicide growing out of the
recent murder of Probate Judge
W. T. Lawler. The sheriff left a
note saying that he had been sus
pected of the murder, asserting his
innocence and declaring that he
had been "fooled" and "could not
"stand the strain."
Sheriff Williams had been known
as a political friend of D. D. Over
ton, for whom a warrant has been
issued in connection with the Law
ler murder, and it was said by the
sheriff's friends tonight that worry
over criticism because he had not
arrested Overton had caused the
suicide. That the sheriff should have
thought himself suspected of the
Lawler murder, however, was said
by his friends to be as great a sur
prise as that caused here Wednesday
when Shelby S. Pleasants, a local
attorney, was found shot to death in
his office, leaving a note saying that
he intended to kill himself because
he was suspected of murdering
Judge Lawler. Acting Solicitor Tate,
in charge of a special grand jury in
vestigation, declared no officials had
suspected Pleasants.
Sheriff Phillips recently issued a
statement replying to criticism be
cause Overton had not been, arrest
ed, and saying that he was doing
everything in his power to .appre-
nena mm. Later when a si.uuu re
ward was offered for Overton the
sheriff asserted that neither he nor
his deputies would share in it if
they made the arrest, which, he rfi
iterated, they were making every ef
fort to do.

po.xible moment. The entire army
of KM, (MM men summoned by I'ren
ident Wit-ton' rati was placed dirert
ly at General Funston's tii.tposwl.
Congress also took vlgoroin ac
tion. A resolution adopted in the
House by a vote of 332 to 2 declared
that an emergency calling for the
ue of troops in addition to the reg
ular army now exists and authorizes
the President to draft immediately
into the service of the I'nited States
all members of the national guard
who subscribe to the new oath for
that service. In effect, the measure
gives legislative approval of Pres
ident Wilson's call on state soldiers
and provides for their use in or out
of the United States.
The Senate probably will pass
the resolution today.
Diplomatic aspects of the crisis
virtually were unchanged. President
Wilson could reach no final decision
to the action resulting from the
attack by Mexican troops upon Am
erican cavalrymen at Carrizal or
upon American bluejackets at Ma
natlan. Only a preliminary report on the
Carrizal fight came from Gen. Per"
shing during the day. It was based
on the statement of stragglers and
no word had come of officers of the
shattered detachment. The last word
on the Mazatlan incident will follow
a full report by Admiral Winslow,
commanding the Pacific fleet, who
has been ordered to the scene to
make a report.
Only preliminary reports on each
ncident have been received from
war and naval officials, transmitted
as matters ot information. V hen
the record is complete formal ac
counts will be submitted to Secre
tary Lansing and the action of the
United States then will be determ
ined.
Evidence now in hand is believed
to be sufficient to show that Carran
za sympathizers or officials probably
will be held responsible in both
cases. Indications are that the Wash'
ington government will stand on
the reports of its own officers and
refute the assertions of the Mexican
government officials presented hero
that the Americans were the aggres
sors, or that irresponsible individuals
precipitated the clash. It was
thought probable tonight that the
President would demand that Car
ran:-a repudiate the acts and pun
ish those responsible.
Mr. Wilson and his cabinet dis
cussed the Mexican crisis fully to
day, but pending the reports of fin
al reports on the occurrences at

Will Chang Location This Weak.
The location of the Southern Ex
press Company, which has had head
quarters on Main Street for many
years past, will be changed the com
ing week, the company moving into
the corner building in the Stone Ar
cade, formerly occupied by John R.
Laws, druggist.
Mr. J. W. Joiner, the local ex
press agent, states that he will have
several hundred feet more floor
space in the new building, and that
by having a side entrance, that he
will be better able to look after the
business here.
Mr. R. M. Love, a local contrac
tor, has for the past ten days been
busily engaged in fixing up the new
quarters, and they already present
a very attractive appearance.

The litter received from Senator
Williams contained a carbon copy of
a communication which wan ad
dieted by him to Hon. W. 0. Me
Adoo, u-rretary of the treasury,
and in which he urged that official
to carefully consider tho claim of
Columbus when the time to take
up the locations of the farm loan
banks arrive. Senator Williams
stated in his letter that should an
other Mississippi municipality apply
for a bank he would necessarily be
compelled to remain neutral, but so
far he had received no other request
for assistance, and should none be
received would be glad to give his
support to Columbus.
Senator Vardaman atated in his
letter that he considered nothing to
good for Columbus, and that he was
always ready to do anything possi
ble for the city and he people. He
assured Mr-. Weatheri that the
movement to secure a farm loan
bank would have in him an earnest
and enthusiastic advocate, and he
would do everything in hia power
to further its success.

ABERDEEN GAMES
EVENLY DIVIDED
Columbus Will Be Here Five
Days this Week, Playing
Tupelo and Aberdeen.
Aiier naving played two games
a . i
in Aberdeen the Columbus baseball
team returned to the city yesterday,
and will be here all during the com
ing week, playing Tupelo Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday, and
Aberdeen Thursday, Friday and Sat
urday.
The Columbians played in Aber
deen Thursday and Friday, and
broke even on the series, having lost
the first game by the score of 3 to
1 and having won the second by a
score of 4 to 2. Sargent pitched for
Columbus in the second game, and
allowed only three hits.
JThe local directors hope for good
crowds at all of the games this
week. The largest crowd that as
sembled at Lake Park during the
series last week was on Monday af
ternon, and then nearly half
the spectators were West Poilt fans
who came over in automobiles to
witness the contest.
The expense of the team amounts
to a considerable sum each week,
and if Columbians are to continus to
have baseball they must patronize
the games more liberally.

San Antonio, Texas, June 24.
The two troops of the Tenth cavalry
under Capt. Charles T. Boyd prac
tically were wiped out by the attack
of Mexican forces under Gen. Felix
Gomez at Carrizal June 21, accord
ing to indications given in a frag
mentary report received by Gen.
Funston from Gen. Pershing last
night.
General Pershing stated that
seven survivors in all . including
those who arrived last niKht, have
reached the main column, all were
enlisted men, but the report did not
say whether there were noncom
missioned officers among them.
According to the stores of the
survivors, as outlined by General
Pershing's report, a mounted force
of Mexicans made a mounted charge
from the flank at the conclusion of
a parley between Capt. Boyd and
Gen. Gomez. At the same time a
machine gun opened fire from the
front as Gen. Gome, reached his
lines.
C'ipt. Boyd had ordered his men
to dismount as the machine gun
opened fire, and the combined effect
of the Mexican charge, the machine
i?un fire and the rifle fire from the
Mexican garrison at Carrizal, which
had almost surrounded the little
American force under cover of the
parley sought by Gen. Gomez to dis
cuss whether Capt. Boyd should be
allowed to pass through the town,
stampeded the horses.
With their mounts gone, caught
without means of escape, ringed
about bn three sides with the fire of
an overwhelming force, the fate of
the little detachment is believed by
officers here to have been sealed. It
is feared that only the most stupen
dous luck, backed by desperate valor
could have extricated Capt. Boyd's
men from the trap.
The reports from Mexican sources
have placed the number killed, in
cluding two officers, at from 1 to
40. It is reported 17 were taken cap
tive into Chihuahua. The accepted
percentage of wounded in modern
warfare would place the wounded at
from 35 to 40 at the lowest estimate.

to ' nt the regular army and the or
trnieij nnlitia in a general cam
paign and sources fur replenish
ment of the supply art open.
iHiring the three months Ameri
can troops have been in Mexico such
improvement bus been mad in the
army t reorganization and equip
ment that officers here admitted to
lay that it is far better prepared for
war at the present time than if tha
break with Mexico had come immed
iately after the Villa raid.
The greatest forward step has
been made in the transportation de
partment, the army expert declared.
When General Pershing started his
pursuit of Villa in the middle of
March the quartermaster's corps did
not have a single motor truck as a
part of the supply system; now there
are upward of 500 machines in the
service.
The trucks are of a heavy build,
capable of carrying loads varying
from one and a half tons to three
tens. Al! of them are in use along
the border and in Mexico at the
present, and arrangement have
been made with factories for an ad
ditional supply.
Not only have trueks been used
for the transportation of supplies
but they are being employed to rush
troops from place to place. Experi
ments have proven that entire regi
ments can be moved in trucks much
more rapidly than cavalry, the fast
arm of the service, can operate.
In addition to the supply train
system, motor transportation ha-4
been extended to other branches
within the la.st three months. Auto
uioln'.e ambulances have been adopt
d, big water tanks for the supply of
troops moving through barren coun
(ry have bpen mounted on trucks and
General Funston has even gone so
far as to secure armoured motor car
on which machine guns are mount?d.
All of this equipment is either al
iedy in use or available for instant
service.
A large increase has been made
in the number of motorcycles in use
by the army. These motorcycles are
o special construction with machine
attachments.
The beginning of the campaign in
Mexico showed the need of high
powered aeroplanes, and those of
the old type have been discarded for
powerful planes of the latent design.
These machines are now at Colum
bus and wll be sent into Mexico as
soon as new propellers have been
provided.
The long stretches of territory to
be covered in Mexico have lead to
marked betterments in the field
wireless equipments and "buzzer"
telegraph lines.
The latest acquisition is the con
signment of strong searchlights to
aid in locating the foe in night en
gagements. The thick brush in Mex
ico makes it easy for men to escape
in the night, but officers believe
that by the use of the searchlights
they can be detected.
Mr. Vernon Tolleson is spending
several weeks in Winona with rela
tives. Mr. Carroll Hackleman spent
Thursday afternoon in Aberdeen.
will be reflected by them.
Be it further resolved, that these
resolutions be printed in the city
papers, and a copy be given to the
company.
