FEW AMERICANS
ESCAPE CARRIE
Washington, June 24. Hope had
practically vanished early today that
more than a handful of Americana
escaped the Mexican machine gun
Are before Carrlzal. j ,
Army men aaid that perhaps a new
story would, arrive before tomorrow.
But they feared the supporting forces
will only bring proof that the whole
band, hemmed in, died fighting and
without a chance.
In the shifting feeling toward the
Mexican problem pessimism prevail
ed. Observers began to feel that the
administration may be forced to
abandon Its Inclination to give Car
ranxa a last trial.
At any rate, officials close In touch
with1 the general problem Insisted
that whatever Is the outcome of, the
Carrlzal situation, the evil day of war
with Mexico la not to be delayed.
Secretary Lansing and Secretary
Bnker conferred with the president at
10 o'clock by appointment made early
this morning. Baker carried a sheaf
of telegrams, the contents of which
were not made public. Asked If any
Information had been received to
throw light upon the question of who
was to blame for the Carrlzal fight,
Baker said :
"I can not comment on that now."
Carranta apparently la making a
final effort to stave of war by sup
pressing the last note, thus keeping
public opinion In Mexico in oheck.
The highest officials believed any re
habilitation at thla time is Impossible.
The first m 111 tla troops to move to
the border probably will go forward
Monday. Every effort Is being made
to muster the full strength.
All reports to Adjutant-General
McCain show sotlufactody efforts on
the part of all commanding officers.
Eighty-three refugees from Mazat
lan have gone aboard the Baltimore
and Annapolis, the navy department
waa advised today. Restrictions aa
to communication between 'ships off
Topolobampo and Americans In the

riorities have given assurances of
protection to Americans.

110 CITY
OF PEACE
Secretary Lansing's Statement
to Sonth American Diplo
mats Interpreted fin Opti
mistic. View by Mexicans
. .i t
Mexico City, June 24. Secretary
Lansing's statement to the Latin
American diplomats has caused an
excellent impression here. It is now
believed in official circlea that the
prospects for a peaceable solution of
the present difficulties between the
t'nlted States and Mexico are prom
ising. Officials received with satisfaction
Lansing's statement that In the event
of war with Mexico the United States
would content itself with resisting in-
,vlon n wul n intervene in
tne country's affairs. TOey said tnat
Ms similar to the attitude of the
Carranzlsta government, which would
no- but would content it-
W1 & resisting invasion.
At the same time, officials said
that they saw some difficulty in re
conciling Lansing's statement with
the actual presence of Invading forces
on Mexican sol.j v -: .
The Interpretation of Lansing's
statement apparently confuses hla
statement of a war against Mexico
with the manner in which the war
would be waged to secure that object.
Secretary Lansing Informed the
South American diplomats that "this
government (In the event of war)
would have for its object, not Inter
vention In Mexican affairs, with all
the regrettable consequences which
might result from such a policy, but
the defense of American territory
from Invasion of bands of armed Mex
icans." '

The forces under Captain Boyd j
were under explicit orders from Gen
eral Pershing to confine their opera
ttons exclusively .to scouting.
They were specifically commanded An ouvious aeierminauon is evi

confirmed by an officer, President
Wilson's threat of the "gravest con
sequences" will be at once made
good. Action will not be taken on
the words of the colored troops, as
the soldiers had no part In the parley
between Boyd and Gomes, and could
hardly have been familiar with the
details.
There is no minimizing of the sert
oiisnefes of the situation at either the
White house or the war department.

HELD mill
El Paao, June 24. Subjected to
Insults and Jeers, the 17 American
prisoners In Chihuahua City have
been robbed of their uniforms, ac
cording to passengers who arrived
here by rail from the Mexican city.
Carranzlsta privates were said to
be wearing the drab colored khaki of
the 10th U. 8. cavalry.
The U. S. soldiers, attired only In
their underclothing, are held In a
strongly-guarded detention camp, the
arrivals stated. The Mexican sol
diers have subjected the ' colored
troops to gross insults. Tbey were
Jeered aa they marched through the
streets on the way to their stockade
prison. , . "
Word also reached here this after
noon that General Trevino had re
iterated his intention to .attack. the
United States troops If they advanced
southward. This word came after
the report that forces of American
regulars bad been seen leaving the
headquarters and marching towards
San Antonio, Mex. and Calientea.
El Paso, June 24. The fate of
60 men, reported to have escaped
from the scene of the Carranzlsta am
bush' at Carrlzal, was atill unknown
here early today.
Whether tbey were pursued by
the Mexican cavalry and cut down on
the desert or perished from lack of
water, waa unascertalnable.
Army officers and atate department
agenta here, believing the two troops
of the ,Tenth, cavalry, were virtually
wiped out, declared today that war
probably could not be avoided. The
absence of word from the relief col
umn of the 11th cavalry, increased
fears that they also may have been
engaged by the Carranzistas, or are
combing the hilly barren country
around Carrlzal for survivors of Wed
nesday's battle.
An embargo on exports to Mexico,
particularly arms, . ammunition and
foodstuffs, ia in force along the bor
der. Information received by army
officers Indicates that the Carranzis
tas plan to evacuate practically all
border points in case of war. Oc
cupation of Juarez Is considered, cer
tain to follow open hostilities.
Captain Lew Morey and two lieu
tenants, names unknown, are report
ed to have been among the escaped
American troopers. If Morey was des
perately wounded and without prop
er medical attention, he must have
idled, It Is feared. Word from the
rescue column was anxiously awaited.
A report is expected that the dead

probably will decide the issue.
Captain Morey Is expected to prove
to be the man who will determine
If we are to have war. He is second
In command at Carrlzal. He is re
ported to have escaped wounded, it
is his report Pershing Is awaiting.
He ia expected to have the details
of Boyd's parley with Gomes.
According to administration of
ficials, a break will find this govern
ment prepared. There will be no
hasty dash to make a 'clean-up" of
the situation. The war will not be
a war of conquest, If It la conducted
by the present administration. Aa
introduced in congress,' the resolu
tion authorizing the president to de
clare war will specifically declare that
under no condition will the United
States seek to profit territorially or
