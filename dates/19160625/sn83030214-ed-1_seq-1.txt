Complete Story of Heroic Fitfht at
Carrizal Told by Corporal

MOREY MAY HAVE SAVED
REMNANTS OF COMMAND
Machine Gun Trench Captured by Americans
and Dash Made Into Mexican
Town.
San Antonio, Tex.. June 24.?Troopers of the 10th Cavalry
succeeded in breaking through the Mexican lines at ( arrizal.
Some took refuge in adobe huts; others eut their way through
the ambush and. under Captain Morey. may still be holding out
Rushing to their rescue. if they are still alive. are two
American columns. Little is known to-night of the sirength of
these forces, although it is assumed that one of them is com
pused of the troops of the 11th Cavalry, sent out earlier by
General Pershing.
Meanwhile a net similar to that at Carrizal has been sptvad
for these relief forces by General Trevino. On practically the
scene of Wednesday's battle he has massed fresh troops. pre
pared to carry out his threat that the Americans "would get
just the same treatment" as that given Captain Boyd'l troopers.
ATTACK UNPROVOKED, IS REPORT.
This news came to General Pershing by courier from Maior
John M. Jenkins. commanding a squadron of the relief expedi
tion sent out from Colonia Dublan. Major Jenkins also an
nounced that he had found five mombers of C Troop of tht
10th Cavalry, and one member of H Troop at San _4lil ranch.
They also were horse holders. as were the other stragglers who
have reported.
They did not see the finish of the fight. but their stori^
eonrtrmed those of the other stragglers th.it the attack had
been opened by tho Mexican troops without provocation.
Captain Boyd's men of C Troop took tho ditch in which
tho front line of Moxican troops were entrenched, and chargod
through into th*"4 town of Carrizal.
Troop K, under Captain Lewil Morey, charged with ('
Troop, but were outtlanked and forced to take refuge in an adobe
house. They at least had a ehance to defend themselves from
cover, but their ultimate fate is unknown, as is that of remirmts
of Captain Boyd's troops.
General Pershing said in hi* report that he did not believe
that the men still unaccounted for had been captured. This waa
taken here to nn-aii that he fearod Captain .Morey's men had not
been able to hold out against the odds against them, even from
the shelter of the house in which they had taken refuge. and
had been killed.
Maior Robert L Howze, with the MCOnd iqUaVlroil of the
relief expedition. is a day behind Jenkins, and is proiling hard
to o'.ertake and support him. Geiu-rai PenhiHf, according to
his report, has sent provisions and supplies for the uoundi-d to
meet Maiors Jenkins and Howze on their return march toward
Colonia Dublan.
TROOPS SHOWED GREAT COURAGE.
General Pershing reported that the troops under Captain
Boyd and Captain Morey showed the groatrst COUJaagC and ex
hibited the most sterling fighting qualities.
No mention of the Mexican cavalry charge mentioned by
'he Btrentieri last night was made in the Pershing rerx^rt. but
the fact that the Americans were able to advanc and hreak tV,(;
.Mexican lines after the first attack is believed to give some i?
dication that the charge was checked.
According to stories told by the five men found at San Luis
ranch. after the Mexicans had op?*n.*d fire with seveial machine
guns, Captain Boyd dismounted his men and fornied them in a
skirmi<li line. Captain Boyd, with Troop C, led the first line,
And Captain Morey. with Troop K. the right.
They advanced by rushes toward the irrigatmg ditch, 2M
jrardl distant, which sheltered the mam force of Mexican troopa
and from which the machine gun was spraying their ranks with
lead. Making every shot of their own count, they captured the
