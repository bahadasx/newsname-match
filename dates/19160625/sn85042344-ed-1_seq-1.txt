Mexicans Ordered to Attack
American Troops Now

OPPOSING ARMIES

Mexicans Tssuo Circulars
Saying That War lias
lecn Declared.
EL PASO, Juno 24. Appre
hension that bottles may be
in progress tonight between
American and Mexican troops in
at least two plaees in nortliern
Chihualiua gripped the border to
night. American columns were moving
in the direction of San Antonio
and Ojo Caliente while General
Jacinto Trevino, commanding the
Currana army of the north, lias
ordered troops at adjacent points
to attack them if they do not re
treat immediately.
While information concerning
these movements reached here to
day from Chihuahua City addi
tional advices indicated that Gen
eral Tre vino's scouts reported the
approach of the Americans yes
terday and that his orders were
issued immediately.
May Have Met.
With a lapse of 24 hours it is
assumed here that it is probable
that the opposing forces may
have met.
Little was known here tonight
as to the strength of the Amer
ican columns or their mission, but
it was assumed that one of them
might be a detachment sent by
General Pershing to rescue the
survivors of the troops of the
Tenth cavalry engaged at Cnr
rizal. Army officers here also pointed
out that the column headed for
Ojo Caliente, about thirty miles
southwest of Carrizal. probably is
composed of the troops surviving
the engagement there and the two
squadrons of the Eleventh cav
alry sent to reinforce them.
RTtnWNrtVIM.E. June U.Clrov.
lars were distributed In riiitamoros,
oppoKlte here, todny declaring that
the lntHsl) crossing Into Mexico of
American troops near here has been
construed as a declaration of war
against Mexico on the part of the
I'nlted States. The circulars ait
signed by Oeneral K. I', Nafarrate,
who signs himself as con mander of
Mexican forces In the state of Tamaii
llpas. The circulars, dated June li,
declares a state of war exists between
the two countries.
Apparently the circular was issued
at the time of the crossing of Ameri
cans lust west or Hrown.MVl e last
iturday In pursuit of hanults who
utacKea a. aetaenmont or ne rwentv-
stxth Infantry and raided twe ranches
near Ban Itenlto. These troops wei
withdrawn Sunday last upr n promises
of Mexican authorities to capture and
punish the bandits.
At least two bandits were killed and
sevral wounded hv the punitive ex
pedition. There were no American
casualties.
The circular declares ati Americans
found In Mexico with nniM will he
executed, but American purnutn
peaceful occupations south of the

They did not see the finish of the

Major Jenkins' courier, confirmed
the stories of the other stragglers
that the attack had been ened by
the Mexican troops without provoca
tion. General Pershing said in hlr report
that he did not believe that the 3
men still unaccounted for had been
captured. This was taken to mean
here that he feared Captain Morey's

against the overwhelming odds

It was with cheers that the men re

a tantalizing delay of three days,
filled with recruiting, drilling and
waiting, the orders had finally come
for them to move, to take up urms
and do their bit for the cause.
During the day tho men were as
sembled for several hours on the

work and afterwards were given a
medical inspection of Doctors Hrown

active service were eliminated from

which Illustrate the firmly set de

One lad. not yet of age, called at
the office and asked to bo given the
oath. He was robust, well above the
minimum height prescribed by tho
war department for a recruit, both
' eyes were perfect and he had the car
riage of a soldier, but he was not or
age.
"My guardian lives In Roanoke,'
he told the captain, when he admitted
that he was not yet 21 year" of ago.
"and I know I can't get his permission
so I could go with the boys." He bit
his Hp and tried to control the emo
tion which came with the fear that he
would not be a member of Company
C, Tulsa. Then a young fellow, who
had experienced the same difficulty,
but had secured the required permis
sion wrote a message to the guardian.
An answer came late last night and
this morning when Company C left
OF TULSA, RECRUITED IN 72
Tulsa there was not a happier private

WASHINOToN. June 24 A per
emptory demand that Ca-neral
Carranza repudiate the attack on
American troops at Cairi'.al and im
mediately release all captured Amer
ican soldiers was understood tonight
to be the next step 111 the Mexican
crisis now contemplated by tho Wash
ington government.
Failure to comply with either de
mand would result in the gravest con
sequences, foretold In Secretary Lans
ing's recent note to tho de facto gov
ernment. Formulation of a communication
awaited a final report from lenei.il
I'ershing on the Carrizal Incident.
Pending lt receipt the war depart
ment pressed urgently today Its ef
forts to reinforce strongly the border
patrol and prepare for any eventu
ality. Still ImiV. Information.
Full Inf.ii ination from American
sources as to what happened at Car
ri.al was still lacking and the long de
lay In finding additional survivors of
the fight was regarded as an ominous
sign. No American officer may sur
vive. In that event action by the
l'nited States probably would be baaed
on the reports already received from
tragglers
Aside from the stragglers, the Amer
ican deail reported by Mexican au
thorities and the prisoners in Mexican
hands, more than a score of men re
main unaccounted for out of Captain
Hoyd's little detachment of negro
troops. Without exception the reports
of the stragglers Indicate that the
force was trapped and massacred by
machine gun fire.
Some hope persisted tonight that n
few of thu command left afoot in the
desert when their horses stampeded
under the Mexican fire may have dug
themselves In somewhere In the coun
try west of Carrizal and be walling
for relief, (lencral l'ershlng's cavalry
