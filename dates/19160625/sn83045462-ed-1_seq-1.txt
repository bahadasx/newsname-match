LONDON". June 24.?The Russian
offensive still is in full swing
in Bukowina, where the advance
of Gen. BrussiloffV forces apparently
is being little impeded
by the Austrians. The town of
Kuty. across the Galician border
at the foot of the Carpathians,

To the north German troops in
increasing numbers are reported
to be coming to the aid of the
Austrians. and the Russians are
being forced to tight to hold the
ground they have already won.
Heavy fighting is in progress all
along the line from northern
Galicia well to the northwest of
Lutsk, but neither side is claiming
material progress. The German
army headquarters' statement
asserts that some ground
has been gained by Gen. von Linsingen's
forces, but Petrograd
does not admit that a permanent
advantage has been won by the
Austro-German armies at any
point. Berlin also says German

Dispute Ground Foot by Foot.
In Volhynia, according to official Austrian
advices. the Austro-German
forces are disputing the ground foot byfoot
north of the Lipa river, northeast
of Gorochow and west and northwest
of Torchyn. where all the Russian
counter attacks have been frustrated.
The only alternative apparently left
to the remnant of Gen. Pflanzer's
forces which still clings to Bukowina
is to follow their comrades into the
Carpathian foothills. The Russians, following
up their successes west of
("zernowitz, have considerably deepened
the breach made in the Austrian line
at that point, and from Kuty are
bringing pressure from a third directioti
upon Kolomea. which already is
threatened from Gorodenko and Sniatyn.
Thus, while the Austrians are still
maintaining their positions in the
Lutsk region and till now have successfully
defended the approaches to
Lemberg, the encircling movement in
eastern Calicia and Bukowina. military
observers point out. is daily assuming
greater dimensions. This, however.
cannot be developed indefinitely
without reference to the operations at
Lutsk. According to all reports the
Germans are bringing up at this point
a continuous stream of reinforcements
end the issue in the struggle in this
sector still is in doubt.

Shows High Regard for Troops.
The mustering of the troops in so
short a time indicates the opinion
which the regulars?men who demand
perfection in every detail?hold for the
organizations composing the National
Guard of the District. The rapid transformation
of the District troops from
civilians engaged in every line of endeavor
to khaki-clad soldiers, and then
; so quickly accepted as fit and well dis!
ciplined into the United States servI
ice shows the high point of prepared'
nes* which they have reached.
| All yesterday there was speculation
i among the officers and men as to when
( the first organization would go into
service. In the morning Capt. Oliver
<\ Terry, commanding the Signal Corps
Company, reported to the mustering
officer that he was ready. Muster papers
were immediately issued, and he
was instructed to prepare his command
and to have a preliminary inspection
this-. morning.- However, during the
night this was changed, and he was
told, it was learned, to have his troops
on the field with their equipment today
and they would be mustered in
First to Break Camp.
As the camp will be open to visitors
all of today, those who come out will
have an opportunity of seeing members
of the National Guard of the District
of Columbia become United States
Volunteers. The organization which
will go In today, as matters looked
last night, will be the first to break
camp and entrain for the border. Every
bit of the detail for the entrainment
is ready, ami all that remains is to
load wagons on the train, and to let
the tents down.
In view of the fact that the District
troops, as militia, are subject to the >
orders of the President, it has also ;
been decided that they do not have to
take another oath of enlistment. The !
oath to which they subscribed when
ir.cj eimnicu nil'; 'iic .xtuuuai 'juaru
of the District of Columbia now Ik considered
sufficient to require them to
go into the service of the United States.
The muster, then, becomes principally
a matter of physical fitness. The medical
examination of the troops will not
take place until after the men are mustered
in. Those unfit will be rejected.
However, these probably will be few
in vlevr of the fact that the medical
requirements for enlistment In the District
guard are those prescribed by tftte
War Department.

sary unless war is declared, as there ii
now $150,000,000 in the Treasury gen
eral fund, $75,000,000 is due from the
income tax next week, and authorization
already exists for $200,000,00<
worth of Panama canal bonds. Such ar
issue would give the government more
than $400,000,000?enough to carry on s
war with Mexico for several months, i;
necessary.
A spontaneous discussion of the* pos
nihility of Mexicans leaving the Unitec
States for their own country sprang
up, and there were many other indica
tions that the situation is tightening uj
and extending, even to an aroused anc
important interest in Europe as to wha

President Wilson would not agree t<

TELLS MEXICANS WAR
EXISTS WITH AMERICA
BROWNSVILLE, Tex, June 24.
?Circulars were distributed in
Matamoros, opposite here, today
declaring that the latest crossing
into Mexico of American troops
near here has been construed as a
declaration of war against Mexico
on the part of the United 8tates.
The circular* are signed by Gen.
E. P. Nafarrate. who signs himself
as commsnder of the Mexican
forces in the state of Tamaulipas.
The circulars, aatea jane 11, aeclare
a state of war exists between
the two countries.
Apparently the circular was issued
at the time of the crossing of
the Americans just west of
Brownsville last Saturday in pursuit
of bandits, who attacked a detachment
of the 26th Infantry and
raided two ranches nunr San Benito.
These troops were withdrawn
Sunday last upon promises
of Mexican authorities to capture
and punish the bandits.
The circular declares all Americans
found in Mexico with arms
will be executed, but Americans
pursuing peaceful occupations
south of the Rio Grande who are
not armed would be protected.

While information concerning
today from Chihuahua City, addit
Trevino's scouts reported the ap[
day and that his orders were issui
twenty-four hours, it is assumed
opposing forces may have met.
Little was known here tonight as to
the strength of the American columns
or their mission, but it was assumed
that one might be a detachment sent
by Gen. Pershing to rescue the survivors
of th'e 10th Cavalry, engaged at
Carrizal.
Army7 officers here also pointed out
that the column headed for Ojo Caliente,
about thirty miles southwest of
Carrizal, probably is composed of the
troops surviving the engagement there,
and the two squadrons of the llth
Cavalry sent to reinforce them. Mexican
authorities content themselves
with asserting that the strength of the
commands dispatched to meet them is
adequate. It is believed here that the
American command advancing in the
direction of San Antonio, fifty miles
i southeast of Namiquipa, may be In
I pursuit of bandits.
While the lack of definite information
begets apprehension, military men
| point out that Gen. Pershing, with
i Gen. Tfevino's threats and the Carrizal
fight before him. undoubtedly has taken
steps to protect detachments he has
sent out. and that preparations have
been made to reinforce the American
columns if necessary.
Carrizal Fight Merely an Incident.
A suggestion that the Carrizal fight
was but an incident of what was
planned to be a general attack on the
American expeditionary command was
received here late today from Gen.
Pershing's headquarters. The reports
pointed out that only the palpable
strength of the Americans deterred the
Carranza followers.
Support is lent to this belief by the
redisposition early in the week of all
j Carranza troops in western Chihuahua.
Military authorities here who are in|
clined to place some credence in the
reports pointed out that at that time
the semicircular line of the Mexicans,
which had stretched around Gen. Pershing's
command for some weeks, began
to close in, evincing a distinctly
hostile attitude.
However. Gen. Pershing redisposed
his troops, offsetting the Carranza
movement, presenting to them a compact,
prepared fighting unit. The accepted
belief is that Mexican leaders
thpv could not hope to cope
! with the Americans undpr such circumstances,
and abandoned the general
I plan. Gen. Felix Gomez at Carri.zal,
however, in command of one section of
the proposed advance, carried out what
he believed to have been one of the
prearranged details.
Mexicans to Defend Juarez.
News from Juarez has caused well
inform%d Americans here to give up
the belief that Juarez, in event of a
break, would be evacuated without a
fight. That Gen. Gonzales and his staff
are still in Juarez and the town garrison
is being maintained, reports of
Mexican troop movements in the outlying
districts and apparently increased
precautions on the American side, are
cited as confirmatory of the theory.
Further authentic information from
Juarez today indicated continued preparation,
especially the departure of a
contingent of volunteers for the south.
A train of eighteen cars, carrying 150
non-combatants, mostly women and children,
and some old men. arrived today
under an infantry guard of twenty-two
soldiers from Chihuahua City. The passengers
crossed to the American side,
apparently preferring to take their
chances here.
Two trains left Juarez. One of five
cars^ filled with provisions, and three
passenger coaches was bound for Casas
Grandes. The other consisted of thirtyseven
cars, and carried volunteers and
their baggage to Chihauhua City, to go
into military training. A train bearing
five American refugees from Parral is
said to have arrived in Juarez tonight. j
Continued rumors of the presence of
Villa in this region have reached
United States authorities, but have not
been generally credited. Villa, within
the last few days, has been reported to
be in Juarez. Guadalupe and Rio
Florida. (
Mexicans Recruiting Rapidly.
Reports of heavy concentration of
Carranzista troops in all of the north- }
em Mexican states have been received ,
at the border points, while recruiting
is said to be progressing rapidly. The 1
same reports indicate that a number of 1
former outlaw leaders and their com- 1
mands are joining Gen. Trevino's army 1
of the north as a result of a Mexican J
war department's offer of complete ,
amnesty to persons who have opposed \
the government, provided they join in i
combating a possible American invasion.

No perceptible exodus of Mexicans from ]
El Paso and vicinity followed the publica- \
tion today of Consul Garcia's advice to ^
his nationals to return to Mexico, inas- j
much as Americans continue to leave Mex- t
lean territory. On the other hand, during
the day a large number of Mexicans j
crossed into the United States, asserting '
they would feel more safe here in the f
event of hostilities. t

troops be sent to Juarez for transfer
to United States authorities.
Jt was pointed out that stories of
stragglers now have been told that they
in all general details, and that
even if other stragglers should be
found it is not expected, that they
could add much to what already is
known.
Gen. Pershing expressed hope that
Capt. Lewis Morey, reported wounded.
might be found in such condition as
to be abl#? to give complete detail?
of the affair when the relief expedition
of the 11th Cavalry returns to the
main column.
Gen. Bell at El Paso reported to Gen.
Funeton that he had been told by a
prominent Mexican who arrived today
from Chihuahua city that the latter
had seen the prisoners at Chihuahua,
and had counted twelve negroes and
three white men. Gen. Bell expressed
the hope that the white men might
prove to be some of the officers with
Capt. Boyd's expedition. It was pointed
out. however, that they probably were
civilian packers attached to the command.
Pershing Reports 27 Returned.
Gen. Pershing, in his report today, referred
to the number of those who
previously had returned to the American
lines as eleven, although in previous
dispatches he fixed the number
at seven. With those who were rescued
by Lieut. Meyer the total number
of those who had returned was twentyseven.
The total number of men in the two
troops was learned today to have been
eighty-four. Gen. Pershing offering a
summary of his information and explaining
that his conclusions were
based on such information as he had
obtained from the stragglers and from
press reports, called attention to the
indications that there were fifty-seven
missing, and that press reports indicated
fourteen of these were dead and
forty-three were prisoners.
Gen. Pershing does not account in his
report for the number wounded, but appeared
to assume that all those wounded
had been captured.
Geri. Pershing reported that he had re_
reived no report from the commander of
the two squadrons of the 11th Cavalry
that had been sent forward to rescue the
remnant of the 10th.
All those brought in by Lieut. Meyer
were not actually in the fight. They had
cnmcuuy, tney sain, in nanaung in?
horses when the furious machine gun
and rifie fire began, and they retreated
before the conclusion of the engagement.
They had cared for such horses as they
could round up after they got beyond
range of the fire, the full numbtr of
mounts in their possession, when encountered
by Lieut. Meyer, being twenty-five.
The troopers told their stories before
they had re-entered the camp and had
an opportunity to talk with the stragglers
who had preceded them. The accounts
were said to have borne out in all
essential details those previously told.
Opened Fire With Machine Gun.
They said they saw Gen. Felix Gomez
and his aid riding forward to parley with
Capt. Boyd, and later saw him move toward
the flank of the Mexican troops that
had begun closing in on the American
force. According to their story, the first
Intimation any one had that hostilities
were determined upon was the outburst
Df machine gun fire. They corroborated
the accounts that said it was not until
then that Capt. Boyd gave the command
for his men to dismount and return the
lire. The Mexicans during the parley had
crowded forward and had assumed such
positions that when they attacked th?^
were in position to sweep with a killing
ire the American line standing exposed in
:he open.
Officers at Gen. Funston's headquarters
seemed convinced after studying Gen.
Pershing's latest report that all of the two
xoops that would be found now would b?
wounded and that, therefore the battered
emnant could not have moved far from
he scene of the fight.
Admission of these facts increased their
LDDrehenslon as to the fate of the troopers.
rhe greatest hope of officers here today
was that nothing worse had befallen
hem, and that they would be there when
the relief force from the 11th finally got
o them. Altohugh no news had been revived
today that indicated the Aieaicaiu
