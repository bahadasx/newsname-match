sraticn officials jesterday expressed
the belief that they would not.

I do not think so." said one Imml

"The Americans are comins out as

ag-jinst them Is so high that their

"The Mexicans are not in similar

safe in this country as long as they
observe our laws Hegardless of this,
they are returning to Mexico volun
tarily and under no duress to enlist
in the army for the purpose of fight

have abandoned puperty here, but
I for one cannct see wh they should
be protected In their property rights

the same reason, even though they
have property here I can see no rea

DOUGLAS Arizona. June 24, 1S16
A large shipment of silt er gold
. bullion from the propertj of the El
I Tigre Mining coin pan, was allowed
to be brought to this side of the line
jeslcrdaj afternoon, while five car
loads of concentrates from Xacozari
also crossed here.
In exchange, a carload of proi
stons was allowed to be taken across
the border but not nl the car. The car
car was stopped a short distance north
of the American customs house and
the provisions unloaded there, being
hauled acres b wagon It Is under
stood that the car was not put across
the line on orders from General T. F.
Davis
As the cars were brought to the
border, the Mexcan engine crew
merel gave them speed enough to
come across, at the same time un
coupling the engine from the last car
The engine then dropped back south
ward a few feet Into Mexico.
An effort was made to get the en
gine crew to put the cars further
north, past line track, near the cus
toms house The conductor and engl-
' neer refused to do so, evidently think
t Ing that this was a plan fostered by
the El I'aso & Southwestern to secure
1 the return of the engine, which Is Its
property
A number of Mexicans hurried to
the line, apparently misunderstanding
the cause of the altercation and for a
time there was excitement, plenty.
However, both sides desisted after
n short time and retired An KI Paso
. Southwestern engine from the
Douglas ards later placed the cars
i for unloading.
I At Naco yesterday, communication
Tomb-(across the border had practically
ceased. The military guard at the
j customs house allowed 40 sacks of corn
to cross the border. All freight cars
and supplies other than food stuffs
j were held on the American side of
the border.

MYSTERY OF LIGHT
UNSOLVED
TUCSON, June 21 Efforts to ex- '
plain the mystery of the supposed l
signals sent from the top of Sentinel I
Peak Wednesday venlng were un-'
successful yesterday, although invest!-1
gations were made by the officers of
the Safety Committee and Sherl
Forbes and deputies.
The Idea that someone was sending
signals to another observer many
miles away is considered rather im
probable by most who worked on the
case.
Another explanation offered by dep
uties from the sheriffs office who In
vestigated the case, was that it was
the light from a lantern at the stone
. quarry which caused observers
to
j believe that men were signaling. Men
I were working at the stone quarry on

theory that the lanterns swinging in

TOMBSTONE DEMOCRATS
GO TO DOUGLAS FOR
BIG MEETING
Tombstone was almost devoid of
count officials and other democrats
this afternoon when all left for Doug
las, where the went to attend the
big Democratic rail and ratification
meeting, when the opening gun of the
nationai democratic campaign will be
fired
The meeting will begin at 8 o'clock
I way through the city.
ritoriat ooard of equalization an
Olney was active in preparing the
evidence which was submitted to the
board, in support of tho original as
sessments as made by Birdno. The
board reTersed the actIon ot tne coun.
. tj board of equalization and placed
the assessments back to the orlgiral
figures of the county assessor, ai.d
raised the assessments of all the otfc-
' t,r mining companies In the territory
so as to place them on an equal basis
ith that of Graham county. This
' action, taken In 1904, was tha hrst
1 move towards raising the assessments
of the mining companies of the terri-
i
trry.
The other two members of the board
of Graham county refused to obey the
order of the territorial board, and the
ciue was appealed to the courts and
the republican members of that trl
bur.al decided in favor of the nun'.rg
companies
The following year tho Graham
count assessor made the attempt to
again raise the assessments and with
the aid of Mr. Olney was successful
in securing the raise desired, and the
raise was made all over the territory.
In this matter Mr. Olney acted only
in the Interests of justice and fairness
to all Interests and can be depended
upon doing the same in case of his
election as governor of Arizona, his
motto being, "Justice to all and spe
cial privileges to none."
