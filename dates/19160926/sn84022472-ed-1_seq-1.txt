mittee representing members oif the
state legislature from Manhattan and
the Bronx to hear tneir request for
a special session of the legislature to
"deal with the situation" resulting
from the threat of a general suspen
sion of work Wednesday morning in
sympathy with the striking carmen.
No method of dealing with the pro
posed strike was v set forth . by the
committee in advance of the confer
ence but ittwas pointed out in resolu
tions which the committee adopted
that the power of the public service
commission was inadequate.
Hugh Frayne, an"-officer of the
American Federation of Labor, and
one of the directors of the strike
movement, claimed today that assur
ances had been received by the tabor
leaders that 260,000 organized work
ers will quit work tomorrow morn

pension of work until Thursday.

the early hours today. . Acording to
the police a dozen elevated ' trains
were bombarded with sticks and
stones through from roof - tops by
strikers and sympathizers. Three per
sons were injured by flying glass when
the windows of a Third avenue ele
vated train were shattered by mis
siles. Two arrests were made. One
of the men in custody is charged with

Key to Offensive
Combles, a town of some 2,000 popu- .
lation before the war, had been ren- ,
dered of small strategic importance to
the allied by their long-Jcontinued en
circling Aovement. It has been of
notable value to the Germans,' how
ever, because as long as they clung to .
it the Franco-British freedom of ac
tion .in pushing their Offensive move
ments toward Bapaume. and Peronne ,
on either side of it was hampered.
Turned into a strongly fortified po- U
sition by German defensive Ingenuity, ,
it has persistently held fast like a rock
in the course of a turbulent stream
that ha had td: oe blasted loose before (
the channel 'was fullj opened! This '
process has only been accomplished by
long-continuerf. severe and costly ef . ,
fort on the part of the allies.
Driving in from the south the French i
successively swept by Hardecourt,
Maurepas, LA, Forest and finally !
reached Fregicourt, a mile to the cast .
of Combles. More' slowly, but none '
the less surely, the British" have pushed
ineir advance on tht north of the Ger
man salient Their struggles to reach
and hold Glnchy and Guillemont were ,
expensive in time and men but finally
the ground north of Combles and soma
distance to"1he east was occupied, put
ting tne town in a pocket of which the
opening was constantly being nar-
rowed toy the drives of the allied en
tente armies.
Yesterday came the combined effort i
of the French and British to close the '.
opening, or at least render it so nar-!
row that what could be extracted'
through it by thevGermans would ndt
be worth while. Only two roads re- '
mairied over which the Germans could
withdraw their men and guns. The
single track railroad running through
the place had long since been render '
ed useless.'
Attacking from the north. General
Halg's force pushed to and occupied
Morval, cutting the riortherly road.
running to Le Transloy.
Striking from the south the French
pushed their line to the environ ofi
Fregicourt, severing communication
with Combles over the southerly road j
that stretching towards Sallly, The
gap between Morval and Tri gicourt, ,
a mile and a half in' width, anl reach-

from either direction by the combined'
Are of Frenchtsnd British guns.
It Is not thought probable that any
considerable force of Germans re
