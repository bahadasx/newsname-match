leaders continuing their efforts to
bring about a general suspension of
work as an aid to the striking car­

quitting their places Wednesday, ac­
cording to Hugh Frayne, organizer of

Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 25.—After hav«
ing covered miles upon miles of for
ests, fighting their way thru swamps,
and combing every spot which might
hide the unidentified assailant of Olga
Dahl, Round Lake school teacher, who
is Blowly recovering from gunshot
wounds received Wednesday night,
Sheriff Charles Gunderson, of Itaska
county, tonight said there is very lit­
tle hope that the fugitive will be cap*
tured.
Although Sheriff Gunderson has not
given up alf hope of locating the man,
he feels that only a lucky chance
will bring the fugitive, for whom he
and more than £00 woodsmen and dep­
uties have hunted since early Thurs­
day, into his hand. If the man is
still in the woods, he is, an exception­
ally skillful woodsman, and knows
how to cover every indication of his
whereabouts, according to Sheriff
Gunderson. However, the sheriff to­
night is inclined to believe that the
man for whom he is searching is dead
in some secluded part of the wood.
The search for the unidentified man,
claiming to be a minister, who was
driven out of Tenstrike, ten days ago,
because he tried to get several girls
to walk into the country with him, is
still being followed, but according to
the best information received here,
the man does not answer the descrip­
tion of Miss Dahl's assailant to any
marked degree.
"On the nights of September 23 and

Politics
TELLS IDEA8 OF NEW
TARIFF COMMISSION
Executive Expects Businessmen
to Open Up a New Era for
the Njition
Baltimore, Md., Sopt. 25.—President
Wilson delivered a speech almost de­
void of politics before the National
Grain Dealers' convention here today.
Discussing ways in which American
commerce can be Expended, he told
an audience of 3,8{K) people that
through the, new tariff commission,
the trade commission, the federal re-,
serve act, the. shipping bill and simi­
lar measures he exxpected business
men in this country to open up a new
era for the nation.
"The purpose of legislation in the
immediate future,"
Mr.
Once the ^resid'ent, speaking of
the nations of Latin-America, said his
"chief concern" had been to see that
"nothing was done that did not sihow
friendship and good faith on our
part." This statement was greeted
by the most prolonged applause of
the speech.
Co-operation between the govern­
ment and business men, between dif­
ferent business men, and between
business men and their employes was
urged as the only way in which the
United States can meet the competi­
tion of the world.
"My dream," he declared, "is that
she will take her place in the great
field in a new spirit which the world
has never seen before not the spirit
of those who would exclude others,
but the spirit of others who would
excel others."
The Tariff Commission.
After saying that until the new
banking and shipping laws were pass­
ed, the hands of American business
men were tied, the president discuss­
ed his ideals for the newmission.
"'We have admitted," he continued,
"tihat on one side and on the other
side we were talking theories and
managing politics without a sufficient
knowledge of the facts upon which
we were acting." He added that he
hoped he could find men for the com
mission who will, "see facts and state
them, no matter whose opinion those
facts contradict."

Wilson de­

perfectly clear what the liberties as
well as what the restrictions of trade
are in this country."
Every effort was made by the pres­
ident to keep the visit to Baltimore
non-partisan, but when he entered
the Lyric theatre for his speech, he
was greeted with a four-minute dem­

again and again.
Politics and Business.
Regret that politics might interfere
with the discussion of problems fac­
ing American business was expressed
by the president at the outset. H©

BRINGS UP NEW YORK
EIGHTY-CENT GAS CASE
Nominee Explains Old Act With
Provision for Arbitration of
Laboi*' Disputes'!
Dayton, O., Sept. 25.—Charles E.
Hughes, addressing an audience In
Memorial Hall here tonight replied to
statements in President Wilson's
speech of ^Saturday, In connection with
the passage of the eight hows law.
Mr. Hughes characterized a^ "most
regretable" the j^fctrencq made by
President Wilson to. the eighty-cent
gas case inr New York as'in'Instance
where the court had refused'-to de­
clare a rate fixing law unconstitu­
tional in advance of determining how
it would operate.
"It has been sought to draw an an­
alogy," Mr. Hughes said, "between
such a case and legislation in ad­
vance of inquiry. The court had noth­
ing to do with the question cf the
wisdom of policy of legislation. Ques­
tions of constitutionality come before
the court after the legislature has act­
ed, presumably with knowledge of the
facts and upon careful injuiry."
Comments on Wilson's Remarks
President Wilson's declaration that
he considered the eight-hour day as
a principle that was arbitral was com­
mented on as follows:
"It is said that the principle was
not arbitral. It is a very extraordi­
nary statement for eighteen years ago,
I believe, in the passage of the act
to promote conciliation and arbitra­
tion with respect to disputes between
interstate commerce employees and
carriers, there was provision made for
arbitration with respect to hours of
"Mboiy condition of $jnploymqpt„ aa
well as of wages."

Stickley Says North Bakotans
Want To Know What's
Coming
Members of the North Dakota regi

know what is going to be done with
them, says W. A. Stickley, who re
signed as sergeant-major and return­
ed from the border Sunday.
"The boys are getting restless," he
said. "They hear every kind of ru
mor each day. They want to know
something definite, whether they are
going to be sent home or whether
they are going to stay, and if they
are going to stay, whether they are
to remain in camp or cross the bor­
der and get a chance to fight.
"If they do cross the Rio Grande
there will be some fighting. The
Mexicans are well equipped. It is a
bad country that we would have to
penetrate.
"The First North Dakota is admit­
ted on all sides to be atop regiment.
The boys drill like professionals,
much better than they did at the
Fort.
"Some cases of malaria have devel­
oped, but in general the health of
the men is good.
"'Of much value to the boys have
been the experienced officers, many
of whom were in the Spanish-Ameri

"GOING HUE BUG"
III
OF N.DJDHIENT
North Dakota Boys Want To Get
Back From Mexican
Border
NEW YORK REGIMENT8
ARE RELIEVED
Mercedes, Texas, Sept. 25,—'The
"going home" bug is buzzing busily
in the camp of .the First North Da­
kota Regiment and though it is being
continually swatted, it refuseB to
leave camp. And the worst part of
it is that there is no known way of
making the North Dakotans immune
from attacks of the insect. Vaccina­
tion against small p£x and typhot^,
lias been sacessfui, but no serum ha?
yet been discovered which will
occulate .the boys and prevent their
contracting the "going home" fever.
The slightest, incident is often ex­
aggerated until it becomes a rumor
pertaining to the entraining •, Of the
troops for home and a dozen different
stories are heard every day all seem­
ingly being based on conclusive facts.
The other day the ice plant in Mer­
cedes was out of commission and bo
ice was furnished the camp. This
immediately set the Btory going the
rounds that orders had been received
to purchase no more supplies as the
regiment had been ordered home.
The departure of the College Bat­
teries of the Minnesota and Indiana
troops stationed at Llano Grande gave
the boys some more food for immag
ination and the rumor soon spread
over the camp that the North Dakota
regiment would be next to go.
Hope to Leave Soon
The arrivel in the lower Valley of
two regiments from Tennessee to re­
lieve New York regiments stationed
at Pharr and McAllen also gites the
boys of North Dakota some hope of
going home before snow flies. "It
would not be so bad," said a lieuten­
ant, of Company A, "if we only knew
that we were to remain here for the
winter, but the uncertainty of it and
the fact that, we may be called back
in the middle of the winter, rather
gets one's goat at times."
But the quail season will soon be on
and they are as thick here as black­
birds in the cornfield. And then, pro­
viding the soldiers don't have to take
out non-resident hunting licenses,
there will be quail for mess every
day, for the boys have become ex­
pert shots since their stay on the
border. And after they go their fillj
of quail, the deer season will be open­
ing, and they will have a chance to
use high-power Springfields on a liv­
ing, moving—very much the latter—•

London, Sept 25.—Attacking sim
ultaneously on an arc of IS miles,
running from Martinpulch to the
Somme, the French and British
forces have delivered another smash­
ing blow on the German lines, and
pushed forward their positions for
notable gains.
From Martinpuich to Comples, a
distance of six miles, the British have
driven in their wedge to a depth of
more than a mile, and captured in
the attack the important strategHo
towns of Les Boeufs and Morval, the
latter a scant mile north of Combles.
To the French fell the town of,
Rancourt, two miles east, end the
outskirts of Fregicourt, one

mile
northeast of Combles. In' addition,
trenches near Fregicourt, la the vic­
inity of Bouchavesnes, and to the
south from the vicinity of the Canal
Du Nord, to the Somme were taken.
Only One Way to Escape.
The capture of Moryal by the Brit*
ish and part of Fregicourt by the
French apparently seals the fete of
CombleB, which the Germans have de­
terminedly held for weeks, despite
the violent attacks thrown, agalhst it.

Western Union Building Destroy*
ed by Blaze of Unknown
Origin
Minneapolis, Minn., Sept 25.—Fir*,
of unknown origin, late yesterday
practically destroyed the three-etory
building occupied by the Western
Union Telegraph company, at Third
street and Hennepin avenue. 8ever*l
temporary offices were established in
various parts of the business district
and officials of the company
were-of
the opinion that operations wonld
not be seriously hampered. The mon­
etary loss has not been estimated.
The fire is reported to have started
in the basement of the building,
which is an old landmark in that die*
trict. In a short time the flrst floor
was ablaze and soon the flame* had
spread to the second floor. An adjar
cent building also was damaged.
James Taylor, a colored porter la
the building, is missing. He Is be­
lieved to have been sleeping la the
basement.
One thousand clocks, operated by
the company about the city, were pat
out of commission by the£re.
