Dayton. Ohio, Sept. 25.—The United
Stah.i, Charles
E.
Must Be Ready.
"I look to the United States of the
future as a nation with governmental
policies which will maintain general
prosperity as a nation prepared for
every emergency. We seek peace but
we are firm in the determination that
we will enforce American rights and
have peace with honor and security.
"We desire nothing but that to
which we are justly entitled. We
want the estem of all nations. W«
covet nothing but my friends, the
union which you fought to maintain
will not long be preserved unless we
maintain in this generation, firmly, the
dignity of American citizenship, the
honor jf the American flag.
"The republican party has been the
party of national honor. In our inter
national relations under republican ad
ministration the dignity and prestige
of the United States has been of the
highest."

BACK TO THE G. O. P.
Indianapolis, Ind., Sept. 25.—While
the election is several weeks away it
is possible to draw some conclusions
as to the situation in Indiana from re
ports received by the organizations of
both parties In the last week. Both
parties are now getting reports on the
sixty day poll.
One conclusion seems pretty safe
and that is that the amalgamation of
the republicans and progressives is a
thing completed. It Is admitted by
well informed democrats that practl-.
cally 100 per cent of the progressives
who came from the republican party
have gone back to it.
OKLAHOMA FOR HUGHES.
Tulsa, Okla., Sept. 25.—The Okla

The remarkable state convention in
Oklahoma City a few days ago, coup
led with big meetings in Tulsa, Musko

accentuated the belief that Oklahoma
can no longer be classed as part of the

all our men and our women, jtoo, fired
with the patriotic spirit of *61.
"You veterans have aided in pre
serving the union at a critical time,
but in a very true sense every generar
tlon must preserve the union. We are
still a very young country as com

be preserved alone by the valor of our
ancestors, but we can, Indeed, be pre

Patriotism Needed.
"As I look to the future and greatly
desire that we should find solution for
the economic problems of our coun
try, I am deeply Impressed with the
fact that we must have a driving
power of progress, of love for our
country. Whatever our race, what
ever our creed, wherever we spring
from, wherever our fathers.were born,
we must have ap intense devotion to
our country, the United States, if we
are going ahead in the troublous days
of the twentieth century and hold our
nation where it belongs in the front
rank of the nations of the world.
"Surely, my friends, you must look
into the future with some concern as
you think of the possibilities of agi
tation and disturbance In this land.
We, you and I, so far as I could, lab
ored in the past for the preservation
of the union, hut the union of states
must be typical of a union of spirit.
We must have a sense of comradeship

TO CUT SWEAR WORD
OUT OF PRAYER BOOK
New York, Sept. 25. —Elimination
of the word "damn" from the Episco
pal prayer book and the substitution
of the word "condemn" is recommend
ed by the commission on revision of
the prayer hook, in a report to be sub
mitted to the triennial convention of
the Protestant Episcopal church at St.
Louis next month.
The commission argues that "con
demn" is a more correct translation of
the Greek word. The commissioners
suggest that "damn" Is harsh, inter
feres with the beauty of the service
and that Its use in church |has a bad
influence on the young.

MAN HELD FOR
WIFE MURDER
SPECIAL GRAND JURY TO BE
SWORN IN TO HEAR EVIDENCE
AGAINST MISSOURIAN.
St. Joseph, Mo., Sept. 25.—A special
grand Jury will be appointed immedi
ately to hear the case of Oscar D. Mc
Daniel, prosecuting attorney of Bu
chanan county, arrested here last
night on a warrant charging him with
the murder of his wife, Harriet Moss
McDaniel, on the night of July 15, ac
cording to Bart M. Lockwood, special
prosecutor.
McDaniel's arrest brought to a head
investigations of many weeks' dura
tion. The murder with which he Is
charged greatly stirred the city, as
Mrs. McDaniel came from a well
known family and was prominent so
cially. She was 35 years old and the
mother of three children.
In outlining the state's case Mr.
Lockwood declared that strained do
mestic relations and an alleged quar
rel resulting from accusations by Mrs.
McDaniel would be the line of argu
ment of the state as contributory con
ditions for the murder.
The special prosecutor asserted his
ability to prove that the telephone call
which McDaniel said caused his ab
sence from home during the time the
murder was committed was an inven
tion and part of a plan to conceal the
crime. It will also be charged that the
shots McDaniel claims he exchanged
with the murderers on his arrival
home that night were in reality fired
by himself, according to Lockwood.
Following his arrest, the only state
ment McDaniel would make was a de
nial that he was guilty.
Wants Early Trial.
McDaniel, who is prosecuting attor
ney of this county, said today he would
ask for an early trial. McDaniel is a
candidate on the democratic ticket for
reelection in November.
"Thel people have a right to know
whetheit I am innocent or guilty," he
said, "and I have never denied any
body an early trial."
Mr. McDaniel characterized as false
the statement made by Bart Lock
wood, the special prosecuting attor
ney, that McDaniel was guilty of the
crime.
"Countless false and slanderous ru
mors have been circulated about me
and some have tried to blacken the
fair name of my wife," the accused
man said. "It seemed in their sight
not enough that my wife, whom
JL
\4 v\
I
have
known and loved since she was a 12
year-old girl, should be torn from me."
Judge Thomas F. Ryan today direct
ed the sheriff to summon a special
grand jury to report in the criminal
court next Wednesday to consider the
case.
ASSAILANT STILL FREE
Hundreds of Men Spend Sunday

In

hiding that have not been thoroughly

less than several thousand men. He
may be dead, Sheriff Charles Gunder
son is said to have stated.,
"The country in which he has taken
refuge abounds In wild game," he said.
"I doubt if the man we want is alive."
Dr. M. M. Hursh returned here late
last night after passing the day at
Miss Dahl's bedside. He said she is
improving hourly.
The little cabin where Miss Dahl
lies was thronged with visitors and
her pupils yesterday.
