ANOTHER VIADUCT
IK Cedar Falls Auto Crashes Into Kail'
ing on Bridge in Northwest
Jv Part of Town.
As Mr. and Mrs. O. J. Grau and
daughter, Miss Christine, were mo
toring into Webster City Fri.day
en route from Storm take and New
ell to their home in Cedar Falls, they
had an accident. Mr. Grau, who was
driving a big Buick, in going up the
short turn to the viaduct over the
Illinois Central in (,he northwest part
of town, crashed into the bridge rail
ing, damaging the car considerably,
The radiator, fenders and lights
were ibadly demolished. None of the
occupants of the auto were injured.
The car was left at a garage here for
repairs and as this will take some
time, the family went on home by
train, The railing on the viaduct has
been considerably strengthened
since a previous accident there npt
long ago, otherwise these parties
might have broken it loose and
plunged off the bridge.
There certainly ought to be some
thing done to improve conditions at
this point. There have been quite a
number of accidents there, enough to
establish the fact beyond peradven
ture that it Is the most dangerous
place for drivers in this vicinity. Of
course drivers who are familiar with
the situation are in little danger of
accident^ but strangers coming in
to the city from the west are threat
ened with serious injury and possi
ble death.

Junior Class Never Been Successful
in the Hunt in High School's
History.
One of the biggest annual affairs
of the school year was pulled off by
the Junior and Senior classes of the
Webster City high school Friday
when the class hunt took place. Nev
er in the history of the schools has
the Junior class found all of the hid
den Seniors and history repeated it
self Friday night. The class was di
vided into groups all of them hidden
between Division and Boone streets
and Willson avenue and Prospect
streets

Finally, after one group of the
Seniors had been traced to their hid
ing place, the hunt was declared off
and one hundred and three students,
forming the two upper classes,
marched in snake dance fashion from
the high school building down Des
Moines street to the Vienna restaur
ant where the losers banqueted the
other class. The high school faculty
was also an honored addition to the
feast.
The Vienna Cafe was elaborately
decorated for the occasion with the
high school colors of purple and gold.
Golden rod and wild sumac leaves
were used in profusion about the
cafe and two long tables were glist
ening in white and silver for the
student body, while the faculty oc
cupied the side "Pullmans" which
were also tastefully decorated. A
dainty two course oyster, supper was
served. At the close of 'the banquet
the senior class president Ben- Breit
enkamp was called upon for a
speech, but instead, directed the stu
dents in the singing of a number of
high school songs. After these and
the vociferous giving of many yells,
the classes dispersed having experi
enced one of the most delightful of
many such meetings.

MI ABOUT IIREW
SCHOOUHIIUIRG?
People of Webster City Ought to be
Giving Careful Attention toj
This Question.
It has been quite evident for a
year or two to people who have tak
en the trouble to inquire into the
school situation in Webeter City
that it is a matter of but a short
time until this district must erect a
new school building. The schools
are now overcrowded and many of
the teachers have more scholars than
they can successfully handle. This
is not economy and is very unsatis
factory from every right point of
view. When the high school build
ing was erected several year3 ago
the mistake was made of not look
ing far enough into the future. In
stead of expending $40,000 at that
time the district should have put up
a structure worth at least $150,000.
Had this been done the school build
ing problem in Webster City would
have been settled for at least fifteen
or twenty years. It can never be
settled permanently as long as the
town continues to grow and we all
want the town to keep right on in
creasing in ^ize and importance.
The Freeman-Tribune is heartily
in favor of a new school building,
but is just as heartily opposed to
any improvement worth less than at
least $100,000, and believes the
district would be Justified in erecting
one worth from $150,000 to $200,
000. Our schools are now costing
us approximately $35,000 a year, but
they are worth every cent of it, and
more. The Freeman-Tribune is not
disposed to seriously consider the
cost, so long as the money is needed
and is judiciously expanded. Not
penny should be wasted, It is the
wmste and -needless expense at which
taxpayers complain.
The way to build permanent im
provements of this character Is to
raise a large share of the funds by
bonds. The money can be secured at
approximately 4 per cent, thus inter
est on a school building worth $150,
000 would cost the district $6,000.
Then there should be a sinking fund
created to take care of the bonds
when the building is worn out. In this
way the taxpayers each year would
bear 'their proportionate share of the
burden and they should bear no
more, no less.
Let the people of the district talk
the matter over and be prepared to
vote upon the question of a bond is
stie at the next school election next
spring. The Freeman-Tribune hopes
the mistake of building a structure
not large enough will, not be repeat
ed. Nothing less than $100,000
should be considered, and an expen
diture, of 200,000, if that amount
seems necessary, need not frighten
anybody.
Good Auction Prices.
Lehigh Argus: The O. J. Wjodard
referee sale of the Douglas estate
homestead, yesterday at the old farm
home northwest of town, was well
attended, and the total sales aggre
gated $63,000. The James N. Doug

Searching for Bert.
Cedar Rapids Gazette: Newspap

ler occupation than the style of poli
tics prevailing in Iowa. Let's all
lay off and hunt for Bert.

He removed from Indiana to Illinois
in 1870 and wap married to Miss

this union were born ten children of
whom two have already passed on
The wife and eight children survive

an honest industrious citizen of the
town. The funeral services were
held on Monday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock at the Christian church, Rev,
C. V. Pence officiating.
Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Silvers, who

HI6H SCHOOL TiAl
DEFEATS ALUMNI
Football Team Makes Fair Showing
in Practice Game Against
the Stars.
Coach Slfert's football recruits in
itiated the 1916 season Friday af
ternoon on the Riverside Park grid
iron, defeating a hastily mustered
squad of "has-beens" of former
teams. The game was naturally rag
ged,* but a fair showing was made
for a first game of the season.
The players of the alumni squad
were handicapped by lack of condl
tion and practice, but aided by
weight and experience, they were
qble to give the high school lads
some stiff opposition. However, the
score resulted in a three-touchdown
victory for the high school, all three
touchdowns being tallied early in the
game. Coach Sifert made many sub
stitutions as the game advanced, be
ing anxious to get a line on the abil
ity of the younger and less experi
enced players who comprise most of
the material available for this year's
eleven.
The ranks of the "old-timers" in
cluded Simpson and Clark of last
year's team, Raymond France,
Adolph Boeye, Millard Tatham, and
other football luminaries of by-gone
days. Difficulty was experienced in
getting out a full quota of eleven
men, and DeFrance and Kleckner of
the present squad were shifted to the
"first-aid" division.
The opening game of the season at
Riverside Park will not occur until
October 28, when Storm Lake's fast
eleven will battle the local athletes
in this city. It is expected, however,
that many local fans will attend the
game next Saturday at Fort Dodge.
Friday's contest revealed many
weaknesses, especially on the line,
toward which the energies of the
roach will be directed during this
coming week.
The line-up was as follows:
Ends, McConnell and Richardson
tackles, Leopold and Thompson
guards, Robert Boeye and Staley
center, Mason quarter, Lane:
halves, Ward and Daniels full-back,
Froning (c).
Substitutions: Quarter, Williams
half, DeFrance guard, Christensen
ends, #lahne, Stafford and Ward.
H. B. McKee has purchased a fine
new seven passenger Chalmers from

WEBSTEB CITY, IOWA, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1916
IOWA GUARD RUr BE
inn
Gen. Guy E. Logan Recommends
That They be Returned to
Fort Des Moines.
Des Moines, Sept. 23.—Capt. C.
Robbins of Cedar Rapids,who was in
Des Moines Friday to consult Adjt
Gen. Guy E. Logan, while on his way
home from Brownsville on a thirty
day furlough, declared that in his
opinion none of the Iowa troops will
be sent home before Nov. 1.
Adjutant General Logan yesterday
made a recommendation to the war
department that the Iowa regiments
be sent back to Fort Des Moines in
stead of Camp Dodge, when the time
for mustering out arrives.
The use of Fort Des Moines Is fav
ored as the soldiers will be able to
use the steam heated barracks in
stead of being forced to camp in
tents at Camp Dodge. As the regi
ments will be moved from Texas
where the temperature is high, to
Iowa where the winter weather is
more severe, the military department
feels that a tent camp would result
in serious effects on the men. Many
soldiers might contract pneumonia
and some deaths might follow, the
officers say.
"We have been hoping that some
of the Iowa regiments would be sent
back home under the recent order of
the war department,'' said Captain
Robbins. "The nfcw rule is that for
every new regiment which reaches
the border, one 'of the regiments
there now, shall be sent home. We
have noticed that so far the regi
ments which arrived at the border
first, are being sent home first.
"The Iowa regiments were not
among the first to reach the border.
Urtbm th«. 4«Pftrtfoenfc 4ep»ttat from
the plan which apparently Is baing
followed the Iowa men may not get
back home under this order.
We had been hoping that the
government would begin gradually
withdrawing national guard regi
ments from Texas. However, there
have recently been some disturban
ces in Mexico and' t^ie military men
are wondering whether the border
guard will be lessened to any great
extent until it is quiet again beyond
*he border.
"We exchange shots quite often
with Mexicans across the Rio Gran
de. Every once in a while a Mexi
can will hide along the opposite
bank and open fire on a sentry. We
have instructions to fire back and we
do it. So far no one has been hurt
on our side. Park Findley of Des
Moines recently took several shots at
a Mexican who opened fire on him."
Dennis Kelly in Glee Club.
Dennis Kelly has been selected
among others to fill vacancies in the
Grinnell College Glee club, accord
ing to the following item:
Grinnell, Sept. 23.—Theodore
Budlong of Des Moines, Andrew Bun
ton of Pawnee City, Neb. Earl Gin
gles of Castana, Royal Duckworth of
Boone, F. T. Parker of Rock Rap

and Willard Osincup of Waverly,
were selected today to fill the va
cancies in the Grinnell College club
after a competitive tryout lasting a
week in which sixty men competed.
The complete club will begin at
once for Sunday vesper services. Two
trips are planned for the club this
year, one at Christmas and one dur

awarded Sunday at the Sunday
school hour:
First prize—silver napkin clasp—
Mrs. Alexander Groves.
Second prize—silver mounted pen

PROPERTY OWNERS IN
CENSEDJT FACTORY
Much Indignation Over Proi osed
Rendering Establishment by
John T. LaForge.
Nine or ten property owners in
this city whose land or homes adjoin
or are near that recently purchased
by Jo^hn T. LaForge of Boone for the
purpose of a rendering or soap fact
ory, are on the warpath with paint,
feathers and all the accoutrements.
The gentle breezes of spring have
been in the habit of wafting to
those residents upon the east side of
the city, at the extreme south end of
Bell avenue, all the perfume of wild
cijabapple blossoms, early spring vio
lets and sweet Williams.
The prospect of a different brand
of attar—not from roses—is not
pleasing in any sense to the residents
of that part of town and they pro
pose to see that something,is done
about it. They are not the only
ones wearing the war paint those
who reside upon the hill just south
west of the factory which is now in
the course of erection, are as highly
incensed and will join the others in
action against the establishment.
Actually weighing odor against odor,
there is little difference to the olfact
ory nerve between the offenslveness
of an odor from a slaughter house,
a tannery, a retarder factory and a
rendering or soap factory. A smell
from any of these concerns would
smell as vile, just as a rose by any
other name would smell as sweet,
Investigation reveals that there is
no ordinance now in existence in this
city against such a factory, although
the city council has full power to
enact such a one for the health and
comfort of the community. However,
after the thing is in actual opera
tion and going at full smelling tilt
the council may put a quietus upon
the thing as a nuisance. has
been done in this city in regard to
slaughter houses and will probably
be done again.
It remains to b^ seen whether or
not the property owners are going
to be content with waiting until a
nuisance has proven conclusively
that it is a nuisance, before they take
steps to oust it.
The Code of Iowa under section
5078 says some things which look
convincing to a layman, but which
under the microscope of a legal glass
seem to have no bearing c\i the sit
uation. The words are:
"The erecting, continuing, or us
ing any building or other place for
the exercise of any trade, employ
ment or manufacture, which, by oc
casioning noxious exhalations, of
fensive ^melis, or other annoyances,
becomes injurious and dangerous to
the health, comfort or property of
individuals or the public"—together
with other named offenses such as
the pollution of a stream, etc., "are
nuisances."

Jim Inman, Angered at the Law's
Demands, Takes Himself to
the Capital City,
One Jim Inman made a voyage on
Saturday to Fort Dodge wliere the
brand of whiskey is infinitely better
than any which might be obtained
in Waterloo, Des Moines, or else
where, for it makes a man entirely
forget all his cares and tribulations.
One thing it does not do, however,'
that is—it does not keep him out of
trouble, for as soon as he returned,
to Webster City, he was arrested for
being drunk, intoxicated and under
the direct influence of liquor.
This being the case, he was plac
ed in duress vile, there to suffer the
slings and arrows of an outrageous
fortune until evening, at which
time he besought Justice Tucker for
an interview. The justice, being of
an unusually obliging disposition to
all guests entertained at the city's
expense, made him a call. Upon fur
ther request, the trial was held at
once and the fine of $15 given. Up
on the payment of the fine, Mr. In
man spoke almost scathingly of
Webster City and vicinity, even
threatening to shake the dust of the
streets from his feet and leave for
more congenial surroundings—even
Des Moines.
Accordingly he left for Des Moines
on the night train and unless he suf
fers a like reception there, will un
doubtedly make that city his future
home. Mr. Inman had been employ
ed in the country near this city
working upon a ditch and everything
had gone smoothly until Saturday.

The Famous Bradley
Knit Wear
The Bradley, born an aristocrat and college bred, dominates in
Shakers as in all types of knit coats, whether in striped, Navajo
or plain styles, there is a snap and vigor that has made the
Bradley the choice of the people. In a Bradley you find "the
height of enjoyment." The high spots of comfort are in its soft,
rich tecture and the elasticity that allows care-free use without
detriment to its neat appearance. When set off with a Brad*
ley knit cap or scarf you have an ideal Bradley combination,
distinctly in vogue.
