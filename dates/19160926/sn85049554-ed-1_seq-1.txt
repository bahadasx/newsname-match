Paris, Sept. 26.—Fighting continued
all night north of the Somme, the Ger
mans making desperate effort* to
atem the tide which ia engulfing
Combles.
Early yesterday afternoon the Ger
mans are reported to have begun mov
ing out of Combles a number of guns.
This occurred before the British bad ta
ken Morval or the French had reached
Fregicourt. -The- village._qf Fregicourt
ia on the roifll from ComblesPto Sallli
Bel, the only road which, before yester
day's battle, the Germans could use to
evacuate Coinblee. The road is now
swept by fire from French machine
guns.
From the south of Morval, held by
the British, to the French positions
south of Fregicourt, a distance of only
about 1,800 yards, was the only part of
the loop around Combles which remain

accomplished and the situation of the
Germans in Combles is worse than pre

GREAT DAY FOR
ANGLO-FRENCH ARMY
Views Battle From Heights and in
Midst of Roaring Cannon—Germans
Driven From Last Strongholds in
Front of Combles and Compelled to
Fight in Open— Remnant of Defend
sra Facing Extermination or Capturs
British Front in France, Sept. 26.—
This has been another great day for
the Anglo-French, forces on the
Somme. As a spectacle for the ob
server it was the Inost splendid of all
the attacks made^ by the allied forces
since the commencement of the pres
ent offensive.
What either army was trying 4o do
or how they were doing it, in the play
of the blue front French legions and
the kahkl brigades of Britain, was
comprehensible to the eye in the glor
ious autumn sunlight.
The British have taken half of Mor
val, all of Lesboenuf, and have ad
vanced their line on a front of 8,000
yards for an average depth of 1,000
yards the French have stormed Ran
court and have pushed their line to the
outskirts of^the little village of Fregi
court, a mile east and a little north of
Combles. The German stronghold of
Combles is virtually isolated.
Wall of Big Guna.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press went forward yesterday over the
ridge in the Devil's wood and Ginchy
region, which the British had fought
for over two months to gain. He
walked for two miles thru an area
which reverberated to the blasts of the
great guns, picking his way between
the bursts of flame from the crashing
batteries and moving around the rows
of cannon as one who seeks a ford in
a stream. On the other side of the
ridge he saw guns where he had never
seen them before. They were close tip
to the British infantry, who listened
to their thunderous chorus as they
prepared for the charge in today's at
tack.
"The usual^ artillery preparation,"
said an artillery official.
The correspondent decided, in re
turning. he would not pass thru lhat
wilderness- of guns of all size and cal
iber while he had any hearing left.
•fcvTorv 4ndr waiT fMrlng atrtop-sfteed^ JHe
chose a' gaUerV which 'took mm past
many batteries, which for two miles'
were pouring out their thunderous gun
fire. •,
Infantry Attacks.
From the ruins of a German trenc*
where the battle panorama stretched
before him, the correspondent had a
near view of the French gunners who
were feeding the guns as grain is fed
to a threshing machine.
Shortly after noon was the time
chosen for the Infantry to rush for
ward. The ridges In front and on
either hftnd were flecked with racing
sparks of flame. Within an hour at
least 50,000 shells must have been fired
within sight of the correspondent. Far
to the south was Mont St. Quentin,
two miles from Peronne, and com
lmandng that town, which the allied
commanders say will fall like a ripe
plum when the time comes. The hill
lay hazy above the green foliage of
the valley, and vast bursts of black
smoke from shells of enormous cali
ber.
Like 8«oring a Game.
At the appointed time the waves of
Infantry surged forward to attack.
Then the tremendous Are of the Ger
nhan guns swelled to Its utmost vol
ume. The attacking infantry vanished
In that grim pall, while high overhead
scores of sausage balloons and hun
dreds of aeroplanes, their wings gleam
ing like sliver In the sunlight, strove
vainly to see what was passing be
neath them. Then across the dead
fields arose a signal from iMorval,
which told^ that the British Infantry
had reached another goal and Lhat an
other village was taken. A man at a
telephone In a near-by signal station
called out the cmpture of the different
strong points with the enthusiasm of
one who scored a hotly contested
game.
Must Fiaht in Open,
Presently the British wounded be
gan to straggle back, and their hearing
as they moved along beside their pri
soners was another criterion by which
the correspondent knew how the day
Had gone without making Inquiries of
the staff. The German machine ffuns
had stopped them for awhile at some
points, but every point was taken. The
British wounded said that of coursf
they got there as they usually did.
They said It was becoming an oven
fight as the Germans had no more pre
pared lines byt the fighting now was
in the opep. •,
LOWER COURT UPHELD.

BREMEN HELD CAPTIVE?
Returning American Says Submarine
Was Taken With $25,000,000 Cargo.
Philadelphia, Sept. 26.—The Bremen,
the second German merchant subma
rine, frequently reported on its way to
this country from Germany, has been
captured by the British, and now is
held a prisoner in Falmouth harbor,
according to Dr. R. Tait McKlnzle,
physical director of the University of
Pennsylvania, who returned to this city
yesterday after serving all summer as
a major in the medical corps of the
British army.
British ofllclals refuse to admit the
capture of the Bremen, Mr. McKensie
added, but the geqeraf public Is con
vinced of the truth' of the reports now
current In every part of England.
Dr. McKensie reached Now York
yesterday on the American Line
steamship New York and came direct
to this city this morning. The Eng
lish people first Iparned of the cap
ture of the Bremen, Dr. McKensie said,
by the dispatch to Falmouth of sev
,ersl diamond appraisers, whose mis
sion, ft" wa* learned later, wwrto a4
praise the f25,04)Q,000 worth of dia
monds which the submarine carried.
The consignment consisted of a great
variety of cut and uncut stones, it was
reported, destined for several of the
large diamond and Jewelry firms in
this country. Dr. McKenzie did not
see the Bremen, he says.
The system of capturing submarines
was described by Dr. McKenzie.
"Thousands upon thousands of traw
lers and other small boats surround
the British Isles and lay wire.nets to
trap the submarines," he said. "They
are fitted with an electric bell attach
ment. When a submarine becomes en
meshed a bell rings, an aeroplane rises
and 'spots' the submarine, and within
a couple of hours war vessels have
made the enemy captive."
