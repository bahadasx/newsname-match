A petition from S. H. McElmurry
to the board of equalization asking
that the assessment of the 28 miles
of the Valley & Siletz Railway com
pany, roadway and trackage, be rais
ed from $19,140 to $150,000, has been
disallowed by the board of equaliza
tion. The two members able to be
present, County Clerk Robinson and
County Assessor Meyers, disagreed.
In the petition comparative figures
of other valley railways were
given. The petition recited that 43.
95 miles of the Salem, Falls City &
Western is assessed at $300,941, road,
trackage and rolling stock; the Ore
gon & California railway, $509,650 oa
33.28 miles. Taking off 20 per cent
for rolling stock (the Valley & Siletz-
has no rolling stock), the as
sessment per mile of the Salera, Falls
City & Western is $5,600 a mile; the
Oregon & California railway (ain
hill division) is $12,000 a mile; the
Independence & Monmouth railway:
$3,000 a mile. The petition prayed for
an assessment of $5,400 a mile for
the Valley & Siletz and added that
this is a fair assessment inasmuch as
the roadway and trackage is entirely
new- and- modern,- "
MARRIES THREE IN AN HOUR.
Rev. Bennett Is Nearest Dallas Has
to "Marrying Parson."
Three in one hour Saturday after
noon is Rev. G. H. Bennett's end of
the week record. He finished strong.
The three knots tied were: Leo. J.
Clements and Miss Edna Holmes of
Dallas. E. D. Crook of Monmouth and
Eva Harris, and Adrian J. Dickin
son of Independence and Miss Verna
Linn. The first ceremony was per
formed in the new Clements home,
Mill and Levens streets, the wedding

emnized in the Methodist Episcopal
parsonage.
Prominent Goatmen Visit.
A. C. Gage, editor of The Angora
Journal, and Dr. Parker, of Portland
visited in Polk county over the week
end. Dr. Parker formerly lived near
Phoenix, Arizona and had between
4,000 and 5,000 in his herds. He is
now looking over the Oregon country
and has decided to engage in the goat
business here on as large a scale as he
did in Arizona. He says Polk county
looks uhe best of all to him. U. S.
Grant believes Polk has a good ohance
of getting Dr. Parker to come here.
Roscoe Ballantyne Leaves.
Roscoe Ballantyne, Southern Pa
eilio roundhouse employe, plans to
leave October 1 for Ashland, where
be has 'been transferred by the rail
road company. The reason for the;
transfer is Mr. Ballantyne 's health.
Mrs. Ballantyne will Dot leave im
mediately.
Another Good Oats Crop.
James Glover of near Whiteson
was in Amity Wednesday. When we
asked him about his crops he smiled
with a broad smile. His spring oats
weighed 103 bushels to the acre and
his other grains turned out equally
well. Amity Standard.

WiR Attend Convention.
TJ. S. Great, president of the Na
tional Mohair Growers' association
will attend the convention in Galves
ton, Texas, December 5. Mrs. Grant
may go with him.
Present indications point to care
lessness and poor workmanship on
the part of the contractors as the
cause of the collapse of the Inde
pendence bridge last week. Such is
the preliminary report of Prof. C. B.
McCullougli, expert bridge engineer
of the Oregon Agricultural college,
who examined the wrecked structure
in detail last Saturday. He 'lias not
yet made complete report of his find
ings, but it is expected this will be
forthcoming in a few days. The ac
tion of the county court in the mat
ter will be based largely on this re
port.
Tobin and Stevens, the contractors,
are said to blame the accident to a
poor quality of cement, and it is also
said that they have signified' their in
tention of "doing the right thing."
Just what they mean by this, 'howev-
01', leaves considerable doubt, as the
phrase would "cover a multitude of
sins. "
In the contract which was entered
into between the county court and
the contractors, Tobin & Stevens of
Portland, on the 31st of last May a
provision appears as follows:
"The contractor will be held re
sponsible for the faithful execution
of the work in accordance with the
specifications. Any defective work
that may be discovered by the en
gineer or his appointees before tlie fi
nal acceptance or before final pay
ment shall have been made, shall be
removed and replaced by work and
materials which shall confirm to the
spirit of the specifications; and- the
fact that the inspector or other per
son in charge may have overlooked
snch defective work shall not consti-

eounty.
Tlie bridge had not been accepted
by the county court at the time of
its collapse, although it had been paid
for in full ($6300). The contract be
tween the county court and the con
tractors provided that payments
could be made monthly as work on
the bridge progressed until 85 per
cent of it had been paid for, leaving
(he balance to be due after accep
tance of the bridge.
It was further stipulated in the
contract that "The contractor agrees
to assume all risks for accidents or
damage that may accrue to persons or
property during the prosecution of
the work under these specifications
by reason of negligence or careless
ness of himself, his agents or em
ployees."
The contract was drawn up in ac
cordance with Multnomah county
plans and specifications for concrete
bridges, and .the bridge itself was
almost an exact duplicate of the
Bertha bridge in the northern part of
that county.
MAY ELECTRIFY LINES
P. ROADMASTER HOPEFULLY
ADDRESSES COUNCIL.
City Fathers Consider Location of
Rock Crasher and Bunkers Sat
urday at Special Meeting.
That hope springs eternal in the
human breast was evidenced by the
eagerness with which. Dallas listened
to Roadmaster McCann of the south
ern Pacific Saturday night. Mr. Mc
Cann. was present to 'speak to the
council as to the request of the South
ern Pacific company in regard to the
improvement of Birch street
"We do not want to make a com
plete improvement at this time,"
said Mr. McCann, "as there is no
telling but that we might want to
tear up our lines here within year
or two to electrify." His words did
electrify the couneilmen. Mr. Mc
Cann went on to explain that electri
fication means a lot of expense and
requested permission of the council
for an incomplete improvement of
Birch street until such time as per
manent improvement could be made.
Tbe eotmcU granted the request
Under the temporary improvement
the Southern Paeifie will macadamize
Birch street 14 feet from each curb.
At a special meeting Saturday
night the city council authorized the
removal of the EUendale rock quarry
machinery to Dallas. Work started
yesterday.
Two sites have been considered 'by
the couneilmen, for the city's crush
er and bunkers to be placed to re
ceive rock from the Falls City quar
ry: one on the Spaulding Logging
company's land across the Levens
street bridge and the other in the
Southern Pacific yards. Definite ac
tion on the selection of a site will
be taken at a special meeting of the
council tomorrow night. Yesterday
morning the mayor and couneilmen
inspected the Southern Pacifio yard
site and this seems to have the pref
erence. The distance from tbe Le
vens street place to the city would be
a greater inconvenience than the un
avoidable delays in hauling which
will occur at the Southern Pacific
site.
It is pretty certain tihat electric
power will be used for the crusher.
Enlarged bunkers will be built 'and a
spur, 460 feet long, constructed. The
plant will be ready for spring street
work.
Graveling Road.
The graveling of the Dallas-Falls
City road, on its uncompleted part
near the Hugh Smith ranch, two miles
west of town, is rapidly progressing
and will be finished in a short time
Tflie half-mile stretch which is now
being graveled is the only portion of
the entire eight miles which has not
been surfaced and with its comple
tion the highway between these two
cities will be one of the best in the
, The Southern Pacific examination
car, which makes the rounds of the
system about once each two years',
arrived in Dallas Sunday and will re
main until tomorrow morning. Dur
ing its stop here it will examine all
employes of the company who are in
any way connected with the operating
department, Including lagents, telef
graph operators, engineers, conduct
ors, brakemen, firemen, hostlers, etc.
The car is in charge of W. F. Nich
ols, whose special car accompanies it
and who has been connected with this
work for the Southern Pacifio for
more than twelve years.
Hill Land Makes Big Yield.
Al Stow, farming the upper, hill
land of the Boise farm at EUendale
reports a yield of 500 sacks of oats
from 40 acres. The sacks weigh 100
pounds and contain three bushels.
Some agriculturists have said that
the Boise hill land would not pro
duce good crops but Mr. Stow offers
his yield in evidence.
COMPANY LHOMEAGAIN
TROOPS MUSTERED OUT YES
TERDAY AT CLACKAMAS.
Train Arrived at 8:45 Last Night.
Officers and Men Are Tanned
And Happy.
Company L, Oregon National
Guard, officers and men, returned to
Dallas last night after a three
months' absence. As a part of the
federal body of troops of the Third
Infantry, U. S. A., Company L has
been at Camp Withycombe and Cal
ifornia points since June 19.
The Southern Pacific train which
returned the soldiers to Dallas arriv
ed at 8:45 last night Though the
train was over an hour late a erowd
of about 500 people waited for its
arrival. The company fell in line at
the depot behind an escort of the G.
A R. and marched to Court, to Main,
to Mill, to Church for dismissal at
the armory. At twelve last night
they ceased to he members of the
Third Oregon Infantry, U. . and
became eitizen soldiers again, mem
bers of the new federalized national
guard. At nine this morning the
company reassembled for cheeking of
ordnance and equipment
One hundred per cent was Co in
to Captain Stafrin and the corns and
non-coms of Company L. It is said
that a number of the men had decided
not to re-enlist.
This would have eliminated Com
pany L as the government has ruled
that bodies of troops must take the
new oath en bloe. When the argument
was put to the men that to refuse to
re-enlist would be throwing down
their captain there was no hesitancy.
Tlhere, then, was no refusal.
Wednesday evening the women of
the Patriotic league will hold an in
formal reception in the armory for
the boys. Because of Mayor Kirk
Patrick's presence at a special meet
ing of the council ex-Mayor J. R,
Craven will preside. Judge H. H.
Belt will deliver the address of wel
come. The men of company L will
respond. There will be good music
and refreshments.
REGISTRATIONS VERY SLOW.
Books Will Be Open But Eleven
More Days.
The registration books in the coun
ty clerk's office will close in just 11
days.
Have you registered f
There has been but little registra-
lton of voters since the re-opening
of the books after the May primaries.
It is estimated that no more than
200 have registered, and of this num
ber practically two-thirds were Re
publicans.
The total number of registered
electors in Polk county April 18 was
5964. This is subdivided as follows:
Republicans, 3521, diivded among the
men and women as follows: men,
2102; women, 1419. Democrats, 1865:
men, 1084; women, 781. Prohibition,
196; Socialist, 156; Progressive, 30;
miscellaneous, 195.
The normal Republican majority is
approximately 600. According to the
registration figures the majority is
1656. This indicates many democrats
registered as Republicans. The total
mlale registration in Polk county is
3457; female, 2507. ! . s. : -
Aside from a few voters registered
as Republicans, but who are now and
always have been Democrats at heart,
the Republican vote in Polk county
will -go almost -solidly- for Hughes.
Hughes should carry the county by a
little better than the normal majori
ty. Defections to Wilson from the
Republican column are more than
made up by the additions to the
Hughes movement of Democrats,
many of them formerly Democratic
leaders here.
Among the Republican women of
tliis section there is an enthusiasm in
favor of Hughes that is most notice
able. They are proudly wearing
Hughes buttons, and are doing much
work for the ticket. Democratic hopes
that "Ihe kept us on of war" would
influence these women to vote for
Wilson has veen blasted.
The registration figures above also
indicate that practically all the Pro
gressives have returned to the Repub
lican fold.
The second annual sale of the Polk
County Jersey Breeders' club will be
held at Independence on Tuesday,
October 10th, when almost a hundred
head' of the highest class of register
ed Jersey cattle in Polk county will
be put upon the block. The sale will
be in charge of the president of the
association, W. 0. Morrow and Col. J.
W). Hughes, well-Jaiown auctioneer
of Forest Grove, will cry it.
The animals which are to be offer
ed are selections from the breeders'
herds of Polk county, which of course
insures they are the best in the west,
end are such cattle as were seen by .
thousands at the county fair here
last week. They are in no wise culls
from a consigner's herd, but are all
(surplus high class animals, among
which are registered cows of merit
(hat have made their records with
plain dairyman's care.
Manager .Morrow states that in
quiries have been coming in rapidly
of late regarding the sale and cata
logs are now being mailed out. The
buyers will find a fine lot of animals
offered and these who attend will re
ceive a hearty welcome.
It is the plan of the breeders to
hold a sale every year. The first
annual sale was held in 1915 and
was the greatest Jersey sale in re
cent years in tlie west. This year
eighty-five head of cattle have beet)
consigned and they are from some
of the best producing blood in the
northwest, and these breeders put
their good names behind their con
signments. The consignors to the
dale are well known to Polk county
and western Oregon people, and ac
counts of their herds have appeared
in these columns frequently.
