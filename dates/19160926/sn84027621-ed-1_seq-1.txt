CIRCUIT COURT
SUSTAINED BY
SUPREME COURT
All Votes of Alachua County Must be
Recounted in Order to Secure
Catts' Majority in the
Alachua Precinct
(Special to the Star)
Tallahassee, Sept. 26 The supreme
court this morning sustained the an
swer filed by th3 canvassing board of
Alachua county as complete and suffi
cient reason for the board's refusal to
allow the inspectors and clerk of pre
cinct No. 3 to sign the returns of the
primary.
The prior jurisdiction taken by the
circuit court was sustained. This re
quires that the votes of this precinct
be recounted along with the other pre
cincts of the county. The attorneys
for Mr. Catts hoped to defeat a re
count oi tne voted oi tnis precinct
through action by the supreme court.
If the inspectors will comply with
the writ issued, by the circuit court
and recount Mr. Catts can get the
benefit of the votes of this precinct at
once, but this docs not appear to be
the line of procedure that the case
will take. Mr. Flournoy, chief coun
sel for Mr. Catts, filed a joinder of
issuLand asked that testimony be
taken.
As a result of the recounting of all
but eight precincts in Alachua county
Mr. Knott has gained 21 votes. This
leaves Mr. Catts with an apparent 48
votes that he will goA if his attorneys
will allow the recount to b complet
eu. lmsiaKes are apparent in some
of the precincts not yet recounted and
the friends of Mr. Knott contend that
further gains will be made.

collided just east of the S. A. L.
crossg on Exposition street. The

ing, struck the front wheel of the big

of business, the front wheel knocked
off and rolled away, the tire and tube
bursted. the huere front axle twisted
and bent, the fender radiator and

speed, turned out to pass a wagon and
before he got the car straightened
out the Cadillac rushed by and struck
his rear hub with the above results.
