rLong Branch, Sept. 23?President

campaign for re-election in a speech
replying to republican criticism of the
settlement of the recently threatened

B tures before a large crowd assembled
w at Shadow Lawn he defended the
I eight hour day and declared also that
the nation must be freed from the
possibility of interference with its
commrce. Business men from various
parts of New Jersey often interrupted
the president with hand-clapping and
cheeTiag.
After thanking the business men
! for tiie generous message the chairman
had brought him, the president
begian his speech by discussing the
^ outlook for business in this country.
^ "There have been times," he said,
*? A T\'\Ck1*n
"when it looKea as 11 AlUCIlva .. v.* v,
1 interested only in herself but in these
[ recent years American business men
b liave lifted their eyes to more distant
| !iorizon? and have seen how the marI
kets of the world were waiting for
I their service; and they have sought
' And obtained entrance into these mar
fcets a^hew vision has come to them
o what the development of the re|
- sources of America means and what
f the organization of American efficiency
means.
' 4 .
At Beginning of Xeir Era.
"There never was a time when the
pulse of energy -and success beat so
strongly as it beats today. And yet I
* "hope that all business men in America
realize that we are only at the beginning
of a new era. |
"The problems mat are oefore
American business men are world
f problems rather than American do-1
I mestic problems. America must un)
derstand the world in order to be subject
to its peaceful service; and yet
when we look upon the fieid'of American
business there are some things
that disturb us. Some men seem to
think that the way to advance busi.
nes is to walk backwards and to atf
tempt again the provincial policies
wkch. have characterized aji age when
we shut our doors against the influ
ence of the world.
v "But the chief cloud that is upon
the domestic horizon is the unsatisfactory
relations of capital and labor.
Theer is only one way, gentlemen, in
which the relations of -capital and labor
can be rendered satisfactory.
That is by, in the first place,*regarding
labor as ?a; human relationship of men
with men; and, in the second place,
to regard labor as part of the general
partnership which is going to
11 - ?~~~~ Knoinass men
make lor tne suacsa V4 V UM.?
and business enterprise in this country.
So^-long as labor and capital
stand antagonistic, the interests ofj
both are injured and the prosperity of j
America is held back.
A Partner in Business.
"Labor is not a commodity. It is a
v form of co-cperation iand the laboring
man is a partner of his employer.
"I have recently been through an
experience which distressed) me^- 1
tried to settle a difference Detweeu
some of the employes of the American
railways; and the distressing thing
I discovered was that on one hand
'isVrclted suspicion and distrust,!
and on the other side, that I
suspicion and distrust was returned
fnii measure. i
l&l AUA*
The executives did not believe in
the sincerity of the men, and the men
did not believe in the sincerity and
fairness of the executives.
"The first thing I told both sides
hpfore I required their opinion v/as j
that I stood for the eiglit-hour day. I
I received no suggestion of any kind i
from either side as to what the basis
of settlement was to be except that the
railroad executives did suggest that
congress give them some sort of assurance
that if the eight-hour day
went into operation they would get
their freight. j
"We believed in the eight-hour day j
because the American does better j
work within eight "hours than he does
within a mc-re extended time, and the
whole theory for it, a theory which is
stistrrned now by abundant experience'
V- t his r^cioncy is increased, his <
spirit in iiis work is improved and '
the whole moral and physical vigor of
j the man is added to.
Demanded tight Hour Day.
i "And therefore, I said to these gen
tlemen on both sides at the very bej
ginning: 'The eight-hour day ought to
be conceded.'
! "But they said: 'It will cost us an
immense sum of money.' How do
you know how much it will cost you?
' I said to the railroad executives. You
; are asking that the results of; the
eight-hour day be predicted and the
nrpdiption he arbitrated. You are ask
ing for an arbitration of a conjecture,
of >jn opinion of a forecast of the figures
of experts based upon an entirely
different experience, and if you were
to ask me personally to arbitrate \
such a question I would say I am not
j competent to arbitrate it.
* * ^ ^ * r? f A j
1 "The reasonable unnj iu uu ia .
grant the eight-hour diy, not because
the men demand it, but because it is
1 right, and let me get authority from
j congress to appoint a^commission of
' as impartial a nature as I can choose
to observe the results and report
j upon the results in order tlv.vt justice J
j may be done the railroads in re- <
, spect to the cost of the experiment.

rejected and which congress put into i
a law, a proposal which 1 mad1* to
them before I conferred* with congress.
"I did not ask either side whether
, it suited them, and I requested my
friends in congress not to ask either
side whether it suited them. * defined
before the controversy begun, so
far as I was concerned in it that the
I whole temper of the legislative 5ody
| of the United States was in favor of
: the eight-hour day.
Republicans Voted for It.
j "In the house or representatives the
plan was passed, was sanctioned by
* 1 * ?
a vote which inciuaea, 1 <1111 IVIU, j
j about 70 republicans, as against 54
republicans, and in the senate. I am
informed five republican members of
the senate held a conference in which
they determined to put no obstacle in
the way cf the passage of the bill. |
Now, this was because the proposal
was reasonable and was based upon
right.
"But, ladies and gentlemen, that is
not the end of the story. This thing
I
(ought to "be done tat the time that it'
acus done, so as to bring about a reasonable
trial of the eight-hour day
and a careful examination of the results
of the eight-hour day. But tnat
does not finish the matter. Let me
call your attention to what I believe
Aiifrht all to be thinking about oO
TT v -? -- _
ias to set the stage for this and all
similar cases.
"There are some things in which society
is so profoundly interested that
its interests take precedence of tli?
interests of any group of men whatever.
One of these things is the supply
of the absolute necessaries of life,
it would be intolerable if at any time
any group of men by process should
be suffered to cut society off from
tho necessary supplies which sustain
life.
People's Welfare at iStake.
"But these supplies are of no use
unless they can be distributed and in
the matter of the distribution of
goods, particularly of the goods that
sustain life and industry, the interest
of society is paramount to every other
interest; and the difficulty about
all situations like that we have just
passed through is tins, inai me menii j
partner is left out of the recognition.
I These men were dealing with one an|
other as if the only thing to settle
was between themselves, whereas, the
j real thing to settle was what rights
j tiad the hundred million people of the
| United States.
| "The business of government is to
see that no other organization is as j
strong as itself; to see that no Doay {
or group of men, no matter what their
private interests is, may come* into
competition with the authority of society
and the problem which congress
because of the lateness of the season,

$5,000. with very little insurance.
,be fire is though to have been of incendiary
origin. Sheriff Blease is
working on the case.
_______ [
why congress thought it necessary to
postpone the decision for a few
months was that there were so many,
honest differences of opinion, not as
to the object, but <ts to.'the method."
"It is not a question of obliging individuals;
it is a question of enforcing
a partnership and seeing to ft
that no organization is stronger than
that organization to which we nil belong
and support and call and love
by th?v name of our own go\ rrnmcnt.
