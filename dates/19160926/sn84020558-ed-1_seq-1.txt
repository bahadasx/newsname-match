Over two thousand people, the larg- j

this campaign, heard members of the
lepuhucan state ticket discuss the

There are so many angles to the

Gallop's meeting had a picturesque

seveial Navajo Indians who are de

loud comment. Scattered In other
parts of the ring were Mexicans, ne

dressed in white and a small band of
suffragists. Flanking the rim of the
circle were several saloons. Many min

Hanly took occasion to criticize the
manner in which the Adamson eight

DAYTON, (.)., Sept. 25. Charles E.
Hughes, addressing an audience in
Memorial hall here tonight, replied to
statements in President Wilson's
speech of Saturday, in connection with
passage of the Adamson law.
Mr. Hughes characterized as "most
regrettable" the reference made by
'resident Wilson to the eighty cent gas
case in New York as an instance
where the courts had refused to de
clare a rate fixing law in advance of
determining how it would operate.
It has been sought to draw an an
alogy," Mr. Hughes said, "between such
a case and legislation in advance of in
quiry. The courts have nothing to do
with the question of the wisdom or pol
icy oi legislation. Questions of consti
tutionality come before the courts after!
the legislature has acted, presumably
with knowledge of the facts and upon
careful inquiry."
President Wilson's declaration that
he considered the eight-hour day as a
principle tnat was not arbitrable, was
commented on as follows:
It is said that the principle was not
arbitrable. It is a very extraordinary
statement for eighteen years ago, I be
lieve, in tne passage ol the act to pro
mote conciliation and arldtration with
respect to disputes between interstate
commerce employes and carriers, there
was provision made for arbitration
with respect to hour of labor, condi
tions of employment, as well as of
wages. And in a bill, which I believe
was signed during this administration
in July, 1913, the same provision in, I
believe, substantially the same lang
uage, was re-enacted in the law pro
viding for arbitration with respect to
wages, conditions of employment and
hours of labor.
"Of course, the question whether in a
particular case mat condition exists
which should provide for a certain
number of hours of labor is a question
requiring the most earnest considera
tion. But no one in this controversy
to which I am now referring, had any
idea of establishing an eight-hour
work day. The principle of the eight
hour work day is not in anv wav in
volved."
"I protest against any endeavor to
confuse the thought of America bv
talking about an eight-hour work dav
when nothing of the sort has been en
acted, nothing of the sort has been pro
posed, and the only thing that was
proposed or enacted was a change in
the schedule of wages.
"If there i.s anything more remark
able or regrettable than the effort to
have it appear that an eight-hour work
day is involved, it is an attempt to
draw an analogy between the case of
legislation of that description and the
action or our courts in dealing with
rate cases.
"It has been stated, for example, that
wnen a rate is fixed by law as a rail
road rate, or as a telephone rate, and it
is attacked as unconstitutional and
confiscatory, that the supreme court
has stated that it would not declare the
measure unconstitutional until the ef
tect of the operation of the rate had
been disclosed.
"It has been sought to draw an anal
ogy between such a certain legislation

have nothing to do with the question of
tne wisdom or policy of legislation
Questions of constitutionality come
before the courts after the legislature
has acted, presumably with knowledge

outstanding feature of the first meet
ing of the fourth week was the repe
tition of the failure of the Mexicans to
bring about an agreement on the
withdiawal of the American troops.
The Mexicans produced reports cal
culated to show that the attack on
Chihuahua by Villa forcts was of no
great importance. The reports dis
counted the likelihood tnat Villa
'would become a menace to peace
along the border.
The Americans were in receipt of
reports that placed the situation in a
less optimistic light. Until all doubt
is removed as to the ability of the
Mexican army to control the situa
tion along the border, and especially
along the Chihuahua frontier. itap
rears improbable that the Americans
will enter into an agreement for the
v ithdrawal of General Pershing's
army.
Mexican representatives today ad
mitted the existence of typhus and
other contagious diseases in many of
the more important cities in Mexico.
An official account by General Ja
cinto Trevino, of the attack on Chi
huahua City, was received tonight by
the Mexican commissioners. The re
port says:
"Sixteenth of September at dawn
this town was attacked by group
about fino bandits apparently orders
direct of Francisco Villa. At first
they were able to take the peniten
tiary and government and federal pal
ace. First promptly dislodged. Sec
ond besieged in palaces by infantry

Attacking simultaneously on an area
of fifteen miles, running from Martin
puich to the Somme, the British and
French forces have made another
smashing blow on the German lines
and pushed forward their positions for
notable gains.
From Martinpuich to Combles, a dis
tance of six miles, the British have
driven their wedge to a depth of more
than a mile, and captured in the attack
the important strategetic towns of Les
Beoufs and Morval, the latter a scant
mile north of Combles.
To the French fell the town of Ran
court, two miles east, and the outskirts
of Fregicourt, one mile northeast of
Combles. In addition trenches near
Fregicourt, in the vicinity of Boucha-
vesnes and to the south from the vil
lage of Canal Du Nord to the Sornme
were taken.
The capture of Morval by the British
and of part of Fregicourt by the French
apparently seals the fate of Combles,
which the Germans have determinedly
held for weeks despite the violent at
tacks thrown against it. The defend
ers of the virtually surrounded town
have left to them for escape only the
valley, a mile in width, running north
northeast and in the traversing of
which they must come under the guns
of the British and French respectively
from Morval and the vicinity of .Fregi
court. ,j
Another notable step in their ap
proach upon Peronne is marked in the
capture by the French of trenches in
the Canal Du Nord region.
Except in France, there have been
no important engagements of any of
the various fronts. Berlin reports the
repulse of Russian attacks in Vol
hynia, Galicia and the Carpathian
mountains. Petrograd is still silent as
to the operations on the eastern front,
but unofficial advices say the Russians
have begun a new ofensive on a large
scale in the hope of putting down the
counter attacks of the Teutons and
piercing their front before winter sets
in. The Rumanians are still struggling
for supremacy over the Teutonic allies
in the Szurduk and Vulcan passes of
the Transylvania Alps, but according
to Berlin, alt their attacks have been
repulsed.
The French northeast of Fiorina have
penetrated the outskirts of Peterak.
The British to the north of Lake Ta
hinos, on the eastern end of the battle
line also report an advance but Berlin
says that all their attacks were re
pulsed. Aside from the capture by the Ital
ians of an important mountain peak on
the Trentino front, only bombardments
have taken place in the Austro-Italian
theater.
Notwithstanding the loss of two Zep
pelins in an air raid on eastern England

NEW YORK, Sept. 25. The so-

ton, as a "white list," at a luncheon
ven in his honor here today by

that the term "blacklist" had created
a misunderstanding as to its real

Camp Is Named In Honor
Of Dead Enlisted Man
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, Te.x., Sept. 25. An unex
ampled complimented was paid to the
memory of an enlisted man today
when by order of Brigauier General
Bell, the camp occupied here by troops
of the Tenth provisional division was
named "Camp Owen Bierne" after a
sergeant of that name belonging to
the Twenty-third infantry who was
killed in a saloon last Thursday in
performance of his duty with the pro
vost guard. W. B. Sands, a Texas
ranger, is in jail charged with the
murder of the soldier.
Sergeant Bierne had completed
nearly thirty years in the army and
had served in the Cuban, Philippine
and Boxer wars with distinction.
After stating that the army 'feels
deeply the outrage of the dastardly
deed which did him to death," General
Bell commented:
"Both during his life and death this .
splendid soldier exemplified the best
traditions of the army. It was not
for him to question why, nor to reason ,
why. He simply obeyed orders and
died. No loftier virtue than this can
be attained by any man."
Camp Owen Bierne, in honor of the
enlisted man who died while extri
cating some sQldiers from a saloon
brawl, contains some 26,000 men.
Heretofore army camps have generally
