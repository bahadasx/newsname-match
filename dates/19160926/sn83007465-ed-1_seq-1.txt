ANNUAL REPORT OF
SUPU A.. LINGLE
SPLENDID SHOWING MADE
Rural Schools Show Gratifying
Progress?Average Attendance
Designated.
The school session for 1915-16 is
?truly gratifying as is shown by the
annual report sent the State Superintendent
of Education some time 1
* ago by our local county superintend- 1
ent, Prof. V. A. Lingle. We are going
to give somey^of the facts as 1
shown by this report which we are
Bure will be of much interest to J
those interested in education.
The average term for the county
was six and one fourth months for
whites and a little less than three 1
months for colored. This one-fourth
of one month Is more than the :
schools have ever run before. The
report shows an average of one and
one-fourth months increase in the
past three years or in other words 1
an increase of exactly 25 per cent of
the length of term three years aeo.
We 5|)pe to see the average for the
county in the next two years seven
months. This is not impossible, hut
very probable. Co-operation of parents
with trustees and teachers, and
trustees with superintendent is the
chief requisite to this end.
The enrollment for the county for
whites is 4,395, for negroes 4.036.
The whites gained over any previous
year 344 pupils while the negroes
lost 14. The fact that a decrease of
the negro enrollment is attributed
to the stringent war time of last fall,
and the fact that the trustees do not
allow their schools to be crowded by
children from another district, thereby
causing double enrollment. Average
attendance for whites 2,723,
or 62 per cent, for negroes 2.703, or
67 per cent; hence, it can be seen
that the regroes outdid the whites
in attendance by 5 per cent. The
average attendance for whites in the
town, was greater than in the country
while the negro attendance was
greater in country than in town.
Midway school enrolled 162 pu
me largest enrollment In the
country for a rural school. Flat
Creek was second with 14 6. Pleasant
Hill, with 1.10 enrolled, was the
largest rural school. Tank, n very
small white school, had 100 per cent
attendance, while the Dixie and Antioch
line negro had 100 per cent.
The average number of pupils to
school, whites 83 and negroes 70;
average attendance to school, whites
51, negroes 53; average number of
pupils to teacher, whites 4 0. negroes
73; average attendance of pupils to
teacher, whites 26, negroes 4 8.
There were 24 one teacher white
schools and 4 4 one teacher negro
schools; 19 two teacher white
schools and 3 two teacher negro
*f\9yols; 6 three teacher white]
schools and one three teacher negro j
schools. There were four schools
.with more than three teachers whites
and one negro school with more than
three teachers. Three white schools
have been discontinued on account'
of consolidation and one negro
school. One district has been eliminated
by the consolidations. The
educational board is now trying to
consolidate two other small districts
and thereby put in operation a six
months school instead of a three
mourns term.
Compulsory Education.
Seven districts have accepted the
\ compulsory educational law, viz.:
Belair, Osceola, Van Wyck. North
Lancaster, Gaston, Pleasant Plain1
and Midway. Of these, Belatr and;
1 North Lancaster began this session.
All the districts accepted the compulsion
law by petition.
Buildings.
Only two new buildings were
erected last year. Gamp Creek and
Fork Hill. We have one. Bufonl,
under construction. Gharlesboro
and Bell Town consolidated with
Lower Gamp Greek, and nn additional
room to both Bellar and Antloch
is now being planned within
the next 60 days.
Financial End.
Eight districts, Barberville, North
Lancaster, Dixie, Carnes, Union.
Bell Town, Jones Cross Roads and
Oakhurst voted additional tax for
fehool purposes to be collected this
11. Dixie, Carnes,^ Union and
Oakhurst voted the limit of 8 mills.
Lancaster received from State aid
the past session 98,929. This has

Young Carolinian, Aviator for <
French Army, Loses Life on
Western Front.
Winston-Salem, N. C., Sept. 23.? I
KifTeu Yates Rockwell, formerly ofjr
Asheville and Atlanta, who has been d
serving with the French aero corps j
on the Western battle front, was't
killed this morning in a tight with a'a
German aircraft. Announcement of| t
his death was contained in a cable-1 li
gram rrom Paris received here late e
today by his mother, Mrs. L. A. v
Rockwell, of this city. t
The message announcing the avla- i
tor's death came from a friend of the
family in Paris and read as fol- t
lows: t
"Kiffei killed this morning in ae- o
rial battle in Alsace." t
Young Rockwell served at Vardun l
during the long months of fighting f
there and succeded in bringing down ^
four German aeroplanes unassisted, i s
For this feat he recently received a v
war cross and military medal from s
the hands of Gen. .TofTre', who refer- t
red to him as "a bold and courag- I
eons pilot." He had been men- t
tioned frequently for bravery in offi-c
pial reports. f
Mrs. Rockwell received a letter t
|
from her son only a few hours be- ?
fore the cablegram came telling her
of his death. In the letter he said
that he had been granted a leave of t
absence of eight days and had spent v
it in Paiis with his brother, Paul ?
Rockwell, who had been severely ,<1
wduuded earlier in the wdr and dis-j ^
charged from the .French army. On I a
the day that the letter was mailed
in Paris, Rockwell leit for the front. 8
lie wrote that he had been trans-1
ferred from Verdun to a more active a
sector. : j
When the war began KifTen Rock-,1
well was connected with an advcr-j t
tising agency in Atlanta. With his; I
brother Paul, who was a reporteril
on the Atlanta Constitution, he|?
went to France. They enlisted in the s
foreign legion and began service on
September 30. 1914. Paul later was
wounded, but KifTen remained with 1
the legion until it was wiped out I
after seven months of fighting in the! i
trenches. He then asked for a trans-,8
fer to the earo corps and began P
training. In the meantime his brotn- I
er had decided to remain in Paris *
and he began as a special corres- *
pondent there for several American I *
newspapers, which he now is serv-jf
ing.

more than doubled during the past|i
three years. This is considerably <
more than the county ever received (
from this source before. Notwith-;
standing the fact that the schools it
have more money at their command, !
the expense per capita is very small., I
only $8.42 for white students. Thej

LEVER TELLS HOW
TO MARKET COTTON
SUPPLIED BY GOVERNMENT
Organization of Cotton Marketing
Association Result of
Congressman's Talk.
St. Matthews, Sept. 22.?At a
neoting held here yesterday adIressed
by Congressman Lever and
articipated in by a number of coton
producers, it was decided to form
, cotton marketing association at
his place. The association is to
lave an expert and could be dependd
upon to government and his ser
ices are to bear no burden upon the
matrons of the association save small
ncldentals.
Congressman Lever went fully intc
he matter of the marketing of coton
in an intelligent way. He preficed
his remarks by showing that
he cotton producer is almost helpess
when he goes to market and ofers
for sale the product of his labor,
"hat the producer is a heavy loser
imply because of ignorance of the
alue of his cotton was shown. He
tated that the average buyer of colon
was no expert and could be de>ended
upon to grade eggs with as
nuch precision as he graded the cotm
he sold, and that many buyers
:raded low upon their bids in ordei
0 protect themselves upon a resale
in the markets.
Farmers Would Save Mitch.
If an official expert grader were on
he spot, said Mr. Lever, the seller
vould notlose the difference between
LCtual value on the quotations of the
lay and the price paid presumably
in those quotations. That many men
ire lining their pockets in this way
vas a suggestion thrown out to the
ludience.
Mr. Lever explained the appropriition
of $50,000 by congress for the
?urpose of establishing a proper sys
em of standard grades in connecion
with the burden of marketing,
n addition to this, there is now
lending a bill which will establish
1 board of arbitration, which will
lettle differences by expert graders.
The Congressman stated that il
he people desired it, the governnent
would send to this place an ex?ert
cotton grader. He said that legslation
was pending which he felt
ure would be enacted at the coming
iession of Congress. wherehv n
proper method of co-operation beween
the State and federal warelouses
could be maintained, and also
hat cotton which has been properly
traded, but no housed, can be hanlled
for securities.
Pleased With Farm Legislation.
Mr. Lever appeared well satisfied
vith legislation which had been enacted
by the recent congresses In resard
to agricultural products and
vas especially proud of the bureau
>f marketing and distribution which
le is sure will prove a boon to prolucers.
He seemed satisfied that the
lays is not long oft when the prnlucer
can take his goods to town
?nd with the assistance of the infornation
furnished by the government
ogether with the advantages which
:hese bueraus will give him, denand
full value for that which hf
)ffers instead of going begging some
me to buy at humiliating prices.
At the conclusion of his address
in association was formed with .1
S. Wannamaker, president, and J. (\
Ftedmon, secretary and treasurer.
This was Mr. Lever's first trip tc
his place in many months. He was
iccompanied by D. S. Murph, sec etary
to the committee on agriculure
of the National House. Mr.
Vlurph presided today. Although hf
las just emerged from a long hard
ongress, Mr. Lever looks well and

L 8 C. RAILWAY
SERVICECANCEllEC
FORT LAWN TO CHESTER
Railway Passenger Service Lancaster
to Fort Lawn
Discontinued.
I
Effective Monday morning. Sept
,18. 1916, all railway traffic service
over the Lancaster & Chester Hailway
tracks Lancaster to Fort Lawn,
will be suspended until further notice.
This on account of the Cataw!
ba river conditions occasioned by the
I waters of the recent flood. Freight
jwlll be detoured over the Southern
tracks via Catawba Junction and
| from that point to Fort Lawn over
j the Seaboard line, thence over the
L. & C. to Chester and intermediate
points. Under this arrangement,
however, the L. & C. will not handle
passenger traffic between Lancaster
' nn/l > .. .. ?
>?i?i run miwu on us trains. Fasjsengers
will bo handled only between
Fort Lawn and Chester in the
usual way.
The above information was given
The News yesterday by Mr. A. P. MrLure.
general manager of the Lancaster
& Chester Railway. Mr. MrLure
was not in position to say just
how long this plan would be in operation;
howftvrr. he let it be understood
that the road would rebuild it?
property as soon as possible in ordei
to reinstate its regular service.
Directly after the flood water?
carried away the bridge over tht
river, the road management went tr
considerable expense in the construction
of a large barge system with
which to cross the river until the
j bridge could be replaced, however
of recent date the waters have fallen
so exceedingly low on account of the
continual dry weather and lack ol
rains until it has become practicall>
impossible to operate this system ol
river transportation without con
siderable dredging or else extra
trestle work, herce, the adoption ol
the schedule as above outlined
Plans and specifications, so we understand.
have been made and forwarded
to a large bridge construction
company with instructions to
build a suitable bridge for the road.
The discontinuation of this service
will be a severe blow to Lancaster
from a commercial and industrial
position, resulting as it will in
a considerable loss of business to our
local merchants and business men
as well as the road itself, therefore,
we trust conditions will so be adjusted
as to enable the road to resume
its regular schedule in the neai
future.

VAN TO NEWS ~~
I HUSTLING SECTION
FARMERS VERY BUSY
!
Fast Week One of Commercial
Activities?A Delightful
Social Event.
Van Wyck farmers are preparing
' to sow grain, clover, alfalfa and oth
er cover crops but the ground Is so
, dry they find it difficult to prepare
same as it should be. Some of the
flooded lands can be prepared in fine
' shape and most of these lands that
: can be cultivated will be put in
i grains and forage crops. There is a
big demand in this community for
Abruzzi rye seed. Where this rye
has been grown it has been very satisfactory
for forage, pasture, grain
, and cover crops. It was brought to
the United States about 1900 from
Naples from the province of Abruzzi,
where the Abruzzi rye is extensively
grown and where wonderful
> yields are made, sometimes from 50
to 60 bushels per acre. However,
11 general average yields are from 25 to
I 30 bushels per acre in the Southern
-1 States. Since 1906-07 the great
. I merits of this wonderful grain has
I become better known to the farmers
!of the South and it is now grown
. more or less extensively in the Oaroi
Unas, Virginia. Georgia and Ala
bama, but as vet hardly enough to
(supply the demand for seed. Conijsequently
the price of this rye is
. high, selling at $2.50 to $3.50 per
bushel. But when we consider its
.lvalue as a cover crop, grazing, fori
age or grain, when its yield is more
i than double the ordinary kinds of
J rye. the price is not unreasonable,
i As a hay crop it yields from four to
. five tons per acre, and if sowed
fjfrom the 15th of September to the
. ( 10th of October when the weather
f I conditions are favorable, it can he
. | grazed from the first of December
i until the last of March and still will
f l.e a good cover crop to be turfied unifier
adding much humus to the soil
for other crops.
A good plan is to drill rve in cot jton
lands after the first or second
?j picking with single or three hoe
<1 fills* in the middle of the cotton
rows. This will give good winter
l grazing and in the spring a good
cover crop for plowing in and not
jinterfere with other crops to be
(grown on the cotton fields. Where
'this rye is raised for the grain, it'is
a beautiful and inspiring scene to
see tall waving grain five to six
- feet high. Those who have not
(grown this crop should plant at least
a small lot for seed and they will he
well pleased with the trial.
