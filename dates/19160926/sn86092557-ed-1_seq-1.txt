County Court Lets Contract
For Structure to Cost
$12,450.
TWO PROM TABLED
Commissioners Consider a
Mowr Pao/T of Virtoflpov
Hill.
Cole Brothers Construction company,
of Morgantown, were awarded the
contract lor the Parker Run concrete
bridge by the county court today. The
bid of this company was the only one
submitted on the plans designed by
county engineer Wlllong and the contract
let Is for $12,450. The original
bid which was submitted last week
and carried over until today was for
$14,950. This however was reduced
atfer It had been found that the end
abutments would rest upon solid rock
and It would be unnecessary to build
these as deep as had been originally
specified.
But one other bid was considered
for this bridge and that was of the
Luten Bridge company. Their bid
was for approximately the same
amount but upon their own patented
plans.
The two other bridge projects which
had been carried over by the court
were rejected, these being at Mill
Fall and at Prlcketts Creek. While
the bridge at Prlcketts creek Is badly
needed it was the opinion of the court
that the bid submitted by the Meredith
construction company of $3,300
was too much for this job. A contract
for this bridge may be let privately
and not at an advertised session.
The court today allowed Sanford C.
Hibbs the sum of $144 for the sheep
killed last winter by the mad dog that
attacked Mr. Hlbbs and his daughter.
The jog had killed eight sheep and
injured twenty-five which later had to
be killed after they developed hydrophobia.
Mr. Hlbbs is a resident of
Mannlngton district.
This afternoon the commissioners
went out to Vinegar Hill to view a
' proposed new. road at that place wblch I
will considerably modify the steep
grade of the hill.
