Declares President's Refer
ence to 80 Cent G-as Bate
Case Is Unfortunate.
rayton. Ohio, Sept. 26. In reply to
assertions made by president Wilson In
his speech last Saturday, Charles E.
Hughes. Monday night, declared the
president s reference to the 80 cent gas
rate In New York as an Instance where
the courts had refused to declare a
law unconstitutional until determining
how it would operate, was regrettable.
The matter at issue at present between
the president and Mr. Hughes is the
Adamson law.
"It has been sought to draw an anal
ogy." Mr. Hushes said, "between such a
case and legislation in advance of in
quiry. The courts have nothing to do
with the wisdom of the question in
volved. Questions of constitutionality
come before the courts after the legis
lature has acted, presumably with
knowledge of the facts and upon care

Klcht Hoar Arbitrable t
President Wilson's declaration that
he considered the eight hour day as a
principle that was not arbitrable was
commented on as follows:
"It is said that the principle was not
arbitrable. It was a very extraordi
nary statement, for IS years ago. I be

"Of course the question whether In a i

number of hours of labor is a question ,
requiring the utmost consideration. Not :
one In this controversy to which I am '
referring had any Idea of establishing
an eighLhour work day. The principle
of the eight hour work is not in any
way involved.
Only AVngr Schedule Changed.
"I protest against any endeavor to
confuse the thought of America by talk
ing about an eight hour work day when
nothing of the sort has been enacted,
nothing of the sort has been proposed
and the only thing that was proposed
or enacted was a change in the sched
ule of wages.
"If there is anvthintr more remarka
ble or regretable than the effort to
have it appear that an eight hour work j
day is involved, it Is an attempt to
draw an analogy between the ease of ,
legislation of that description and the
action of our courts in dealing with j
rate cases.
"It has been stated, for example, that '
when a rate Is fixed by law as a rail-
road rate, or as a telephone rate, and i
it is attacked as unconstitational be
cause confiscatory, that the supreme
court of the United States has stated i
that It would not declare the measure
