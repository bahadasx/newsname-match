Margold, Essex county; They fell
victims of tho anti-aircraft defenses of
London and outlying districts.
One came down a flaming torch, as
did the Zeppelin L-21, destroyed
three weeks ago, while tho second,
disabled by gvn fire, affected a land
ing, which saved the lives ot tne
crew who are prisoners in England.
The crew of the first raider diod .in
the consuming flames of their own
ship, but they were not so terribly
charred as their predecessors.
The captain's body was found some
distance from the wrepk.
The death and burning of the first

thousands of London residents, but
the wounding and descent of the sec

lives before their destruction,twcnty
eight persons being killed and.ninety
nine wounded in the metropolian dis

killed, probably four, and seventeen
were wounded, in the provinces.
The.property damage while widely

shops, although one railway sidion
was damaged, some empty cars being
destroyed and part of the tracks torn
up.
