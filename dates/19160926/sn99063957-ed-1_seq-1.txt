POSITION AT COILES
Was One of Two Great Obstacles to Allies Holding Them
Back From Peronne British and French Drive Past
Place Getting It PocketedBritish Make Other Advances
Peronne Now In Danger-Germans Literally Blown
Out of Fortifications
' By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Sept. 26. Combles, key-point of the whole
. German line from Bapaume to Peronne, has been cap
tured by the British after 18 hours of most furious bat
tling north of the Somme.
General Haig this afternoon announced that British
troops entered Combles, overcoming German resistance.
The enemy's losses, the official report said, were severe.
The British victory, achieved after three weeks of
desperate driving against the German center, is the most
striking single achievement of the whole Somme of
fensive. '
. It removes one of the last two obstacles to an Anglo
.j French thrust to squeeze the Germans out of Peronne,
one of the two objectives of the great allied advance1.
The capture of Combles followed a day and night of
most brilliant allied successes, including the capture of
the village of Morval and Les Bouefs by the British, and
Rancourt and Fregicourt by the French. In summing up
the day's successful operations, General Haig reported
1,500 Germans were captured by the British and that
more prisoners are being brought in. The work of listing
large supplies of war materials also captured has not
been completed.
Combles fell after thrusts
in yesterday's fighting drw'a noose about the German I
samson which made their
For weeks, the Germans had used the town, with its
wonderful system of fortifications, as a pivot point from
which to swing attacks, north and south at the allies'
lines. In thejast month of fighting the British and
French lines pressed steadily forward on both sides until
the town was in a deep pocket. It was no longer avail
able for the Germans as a pivotal point but it still held
out, buttressing the German line and blocking a further
allied advance.
The British not only gained this important victory but
pressed forward in their drive toward Bapaume last
night and early today. A strong redoubt between Les
Bouefs and Guerdecourt fell before a British attack.
The French also swept forward again last night car
rying Fregicourt village and later repulsing German at
tacks against positions won yesterday.
The official statement from the German war office this
afternoon apparently admits
as the villages of Morval and Les Boueis, and pays,
tribute to the bravery of the German defenders. j

Sim Francisco, Sept. 20. Superior
Judge Dunne this morning grunted the
petition of Attorney Maxwell McNutt
to defer the sentencing of Warren K.
Billings until Sutmdny.
McNutt asked for the stay of sen

new evidence. He declared he will
produce in court the niynterious photog
rapher who went to the roof of the
building at 721 Market street shortly
before the explosion of the bomb which
killed 10 people on July 22.
This is the man, McNutt claims, who
was mistaken by somo of the state's
witnesses for Billings.

OF
State Claims Oscar McDan
iels Beat His Wife to
Death in Quarrel
St. Joseph, Mo., Sept. 25. When the
fall term of the criminal court opened
today, Special Prosecutor Bart Lock
wood asked the court to tell tho grand
jury to hear the charge of wife murder
against County Prosecutor Oscar Mo
Daniels, arrested at his home here last
night. Lockwood will ask an' indict
ment alleging Mrs. Daniels had threat
ened divorce und was slain after a quar
rel. Lockwood will charge that McDanielsl
was aot at lodge the night of July 14
as Mrs. McDaniels supposed; that Mc
Dauiels returned home about 10 o'clock,
wns reproached for his deceptions and
threatened Mrs. McDaniels to death.
The special prosecutor will also
charge that the "fake telephone call"
was McDaiiicl'a invention and part of
a phi u to divert suspicion to those who
had threatened him for his official
acts.
Lockwood will charge further that
McDaniels left the house after the mur
der and fired all five shots heard by
the neighbors. Lockwood decluYed the
case is conclusive and based largely on
testimony of witnesses who were not
heard at the inquest.
McDnnietls took his arrest lightly,
laughed, said "all right" and walked
two miles to prison.
Mrs. MeDnuiels was found dying by
her husband when he returned from ans
wering a telephone call to come to a
saloon aud get his brother, who was in
trouble. He said the murderer fired at
him as he returned home and that he
returned tho fire. In an adjoining room
the McDaniels children slept undisturb
ed by the killing of their mother.
The entire series or charges anil the
story told by McDaniels, read like a
page torn from a melodrama. McDan
iels declared that upon returning home
after answering the telephone call, he
was fired upon as he stepped from his
automobile. He crouched behind the car
and returned the fire. He was carrying
a revolver, he snid, because of threats
that had been muile ngaiust his life.
P.scupiug unwouiuled, he rnit into the
house where he found his wit'o dying.
