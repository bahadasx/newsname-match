MASS MEETING
ATCITY HALL
Tuesday Night Bond Issue
Discussed for Building
Dixie Beo Line
ANOTHER MEETING FRIDAY NIGHT
At a meeting of some 30 to 35 tax
payers and citizens of Earlington
held at the "city hall Tuesday night
for the purpose of devising ways
nd mean for building the Dixie Bee
Une and other permanent streets the
different ways in which the city might
build was taken up and fully discuss
ed.
The statement was made by Mayor
W. E. Rash showing that more than
S2000.0O a year had been spent on
the streets and bridges of the city for
the last five years, tins amouut nec
essarily in a large measure being
temoorarv work.
The question of a bond issue was
suggested and discussed, and tt was
the consensus of opinion that a bond
issue was the proper way in which to
build permanent streets and buildUhem
now. although it was shown that
by ordinance the city could require
the abutting property owners The
fact that appealed most strongly to
all Dresent was that under no circum
stances can the taxes be raised for the
purpose of a bond iisue and also the
method is only way in which "we can
obtain state aid on the Dixse Bee
Line. The amount now being ex
nended on the streets for temporary
repairs would more than offset the
amount of interest that would be
paid on the bonds and also take care
of a sinkine fund to pay them off.
After a full discussion, and on a
motion which carried unanimously,
the mayor was instructed to appoint
a committee to go fully into the
amount of bonds that we snouid is
sue, the number of years same should
run, to select a commission to handle
and disburse the funds, and to re
port back their findings and recom
mendations to a mass meeting, at
which every citizen should be pres
ent, to be held at the city hall Friday
nieht. Sett. 29. at 7:30 o'clock.
The committee appointed was as
follows: Harry Brown, Ernest New
ton, W L. Phillips, Dr. C. B. John
son and F. B. Arnold.
If we have an election on the bond
issue at the comine November elect
ion it will be necessary for the city
council at their meeting on next
Monday night to order this election
by ordinance. So we urge all citi
zens and taxpayers, both white and
colored, to be present at this mass
meeting on next Friday night at
which time a selection will be-made
bv the citizens assembled of a com-
-j
mission of three to disburse the
funds and to pass on the other
questions submitted by the com
mittee. EASTERN STAR

Bathers Paint Legs

The bathing gill ha3 found

limbs and fooling tile life
guards. Tlio decorated limb made
its appearance on the beach to
day. There hafe been an edict
quietly issued ordering stockings
over the shaptl nether extre
mities. Same of the girls didn't
like the idea and they quietly
slipped one over on tho husky
life-savers, tho official beach
censors.
For some weeks the bathing
damsels havo been bolder and

costumes, until some of them had
tho life-guards worried. Tho

stockings, put on their high

painted three narraw stripes

ner. KIND WORDS '
FOB THE BEE
Mrs. 0. L. Devault in a letter to
Earlington fiiends said among other
things: "I have failed fo get The
Bee for Sept. 12th and 15th. The
only objection I have fo The Bee it
is not a daily instead of a semi-week-1
ly. Please send the two missing
copies as I do not want to miss a
single issue." There are so many
knockers In the life of a newspaper
that a letter like this makes the
whole force feel good for a week.
Why Advertising Pays
Everybody reads the ads and eve
rybody remembers what they read.
Mrs. Jones remarks to Mrs. Smith
that she simply must go to the store
and get a new dress pattern, or a
winter coat, or possibly a new hat.
Mrs. Smith has read the latest crea
tions at some store and immediately
springs her knowledge on Mrs. Jones
who simply can't'resist the temptation
to go and see for herself. Once there
she generally buys.
-Farmer Hankinson needs a new
harness, or a plow, or some other
implement for progressive farming.
His neighbor has read the up to date
ad of the implement house in the lo
cal paper and incidentally mentions
that So and-So carries a good articles
which he is advertising quiet heavily.
i nis excites farmer liankinson s cu
riosity and he "just drops in to see
it." He, too, often ends with a buy.
The woman's club, or the sewing
jcircle, or the pink tea ladies get to
geincr ana spend tne atternoon or
evening in gathering up stray bits of
information. Anything that has at
tracted the eye of any member comes
in for discussion, and nothing is more
dear to their hearts than those delight
ful things that were advertised in the
last issue of the paper. Of course
they all want to know about them,
and tnen they must see them and in
the end they buy them.
Bill Doolittle wants a new over
coat, and the well written overcoat
ad never gets by him. He dropsm and
looks over the coats of which the
merchant has spoken so glowingly.
They are as represented, and he buys.
Yes, they all read the ads, and
they talk about the goods they read
aDout, ano tney ouy wnen tney are
sufficiently interested to talk about
them.
Of course advertising pays. Every.
body knows it pays.
FOREST NOTES
One ton of coniferous wood
waste will produce from 15 to 25
gallons of 100-probf alcohol.
The farm woodlots of the Uui-
ted States contain about 10 per
cent of the total standing timber
in the country.
Grazing experts of the Forest
Service estimate that the cost of
producing limbs in the North
western States is $1,82 per head.
Tile bark of black oak, or"yol-
low oak," as it is often called on
account of the color of the inner
bark, is now used for dye-making.
Tho stand of timber on the two
great National Forests in Alaska
is estimated by the Forest Ser
vice as over 70 billion board feet
while the annual growth will, it
is said, produce of pulpwood
alone enough for the, manufact
ure of three thousand tons of
wood pulp a day.
Oak is the most suitable wood
for carving, on account of its du
rability and toughness, without
being too hard. Ohestnut,
Americau walnut, mahogany and
teak aro also desirable, while for
fine work Italian walnut, Urn?,
sycamore, apple, pear, or plum
aro generally chosen.
