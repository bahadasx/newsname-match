DISCUSSES MEANS TO

Legislative Instruments, In

Will Expand Trade of the
U. S. Greatly, He Says.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BALTIMORE. Md., Sept. 25. Pres
ident Wilson delivered a' speech al
most devoid of politics before the
National Grain Dealers' convention
here today. Discussing ways in which
American commerce, could be expand
ed he told an audience of 3,000 people
that through the new tariff commission
the trade commission, the federal re
serve act, the shipping bill and similar
measures, he expected business men
In this country to open up a new era
for the nation.
"Legislation in the future in this
country," Mr. Wilson declared, "is go
ing to remove all restrictions and
make it perfectly clear what the lib
erty as well as what the restrictions
of trade are in this country."
Great Demonstration.'
Every effort was made by the Pres
ident to keep the visit to Baltimore
nonpartisan, but when he entered the
Lyric Theatre for his speech he "was
greeted with a four-minute demonstra
tion which kept him bowing again and
again. A band playing Dixie and
other popular tunes added to the din
of the cheering and handclapping. The
theatre was packed with grain deal
ers from all parts of the country and
their friends. Many visitors were
turned away.' American and Mary
land flags were used in the decora
tions. The President spoke emphatic
ally and several exclamation points,
usually missing in his address were
found In the official copy of his
speech.
Abhors Partisanry.
"Regret that politics might inter
fere with the discussion of problems
facing American businessmen was
expressed by the President at the out
set. He declared he had "'supreme
contempt for partisan action," al
though "believing in party action."
He urged that his audience divest lt-,j
self of the consciousness that we
are In the midst of a political cam
paign." Befriends Latin-America.
Once the President, speaking of the
nations of Latin-America, said his
"chief concern" had been to see that
"nothing was done that did not show
friendship and good faith on our
part."
This statement was greeted by the
most prolonged applause of the en
tire speech.
Meeting World Competition.
' Co-operation between the govern
ment and business men, between dif
ferent businessmen and between busi
nessmen and their employes was
urged as the only way in which the
United States can meet the competi
tion of the world.
U. S. To Excel World.
"My dream," he declared, "is that
she will take her place In the great
In a new spirit which the world has
never seen before; not the spirit of
those who would exclude others, but
In the spirit of those who would ex
cel others."
After saying that until the new
banking and shipping laws were pass
ed the hands of American business
men were tied, the President discuss
ed his ideaU for the new tariff com
mission. "We have admitted," he said, "that
on the one side and on the other side,
we were talking and managing poli
cies without a sufficient knowledge of
the facts upon which we were act
ing." He added that he hoped that he
could find men for the commission
who will "see the facts and state
them, no matter whose opinion those
facts contradict."

One Not So "Dry'
(By Review Leased Wire)
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M, Sept 25.
Wet New Mexico gave the prohibition
national campaigners friendly recep
tion today when they invaded the
state for two meetings after closing
the Arizona campaign with speeches
at Flagstaff and Yi:islow. An hour's
meeting was held at Callup this after
noon and thn the dry special came
here for a night meeting. Raton will
be visited tomorrow before Cofjrado
is entered.
Colorful Reception.
Gallup's meeting had a picturesque
setting. In the center of the ring of
spectators who circled about the rear
platform of the train was the town
sprinkling cart At one end of it were
several NavaJV) Indians, who are de
nied liquor by federal statute, garbed
in their gay robes. At the other end
was a spectator, who, having imbided
freely, indorsed the dry speeches with
loud comment Scattered in other
parts of t the ring were Mexicans,
negroes, pale faced school children
dressed in white and a small band of'
suffragists Flanking the rim of the
circle were several saloons.
Raps 8-Hour Method.
Many miners were in the audience
and J. Frank Hanley took occasion to
criticize the manner in which the
Adamson 8 hour day law was enacted.
"The Prohibition party is for the
8 hour day," he said, "but it is for an
8 hour day that shall be won by the !
fine sense of justice in the heart of the
American people and iAH by a blud
geon held over the administration at
Washington." He aroused applause
at every stop today by declaring that
universal suffrage was imminent
Women do not vote here.
A Compliment?
"I believe a woman has as much
sense as a bar room bum or as some
'of the colored persons who cannot
read nor write, whom you northerners
gave the ballot," he said, "and when
she gets the vote, good bye booze If
you want to have a drink five years
from now you'd better begin to lay
it in." -

WESTERLY, R. I., Sept. 25. The

WINTER TOGS MEAN ARMY
IS TO STAY ON BORDER
EL PASO, Sept. 25. Heavy winter
clothing was issued today at the army
quartermaster's depot to the Sixteenth
Pennsylvania Infantry. In view of
the fact that the weather here still
reaches close to 90 degrees n the day
time with mild nights, the guardsmen
took the issue as further proof of the
many reports that they are to remain
indefinitely on the border. The cloth
ing supplies were carted to the Penn
sylvania camp, which was vacated
temporarily this morning when the
entire division of 11.700 men left on
four days practice march. Only three
men from each unit and the band re
mained behind on guard.

Some time ago Germany claimed

disagreeable" a reference by .Mr. Wil
son to the 80 cent gas care in New
York as an instance where the courts
bad refused to declare a rats fixing
law unconstitutional in advance of de
termining how it would operate.
It has been sought to draw analo

facts and upon careful inquiry."
President Wilson's declaration that
he considered the 8-hour law principle
was not arbitrable was commented on.
Goes Back 18 Years
"It is said that the principle was not
arbitrable. It is a very extraordinary
statement, for eighteen years ago, I
believe, in the passage of the act to
promote conciliation and arbitration
with respect to disputes between in
terstate commerce employes and car
riers, there was provision made for
arbitration with respect to hours of
labor, conditions of employment as
well as of wages. And in a bill which
I believe was signed during July. 1913,
the same provision in, I believe, sub
stantially the same language was re
enacted in the law, provision for ar
bitration of wages, conditions of em
ployment and hours of labor.
"Of course, the question whether in
a particular case that condition exists
which should provide for a certain
number of hours of labor is a ques
tion requiripg the most earnest con
sideration. But no one In, this con
troversy to which I am now referring,
had any idea of establishing an eight
hour work day. The principle of the
eight hour work day is not in any
way involved."
"I protest against any endeavor to
confuse the thought of America by
talking about an eight hour work day
when nothing of the sort has been
enacted, nothing of the sort has been
proposed when anything that was
proposed and enacted was a change
in the schedule of wages.
Mr. Hughes spent a busy day in
Dayton. He addressed an audience of

LONDON, Sept. 25. Attacking sim

forces have delivered another smash
ing blow on the German lines and
pushed their position forward for not

the Eritish have driven in their wedg

WASHINGTON. Sept. 25 Officials
of both the department of Justice and
the federal trade comm'sslon r
watching advances of bread prices
with considerable interest, but so far
no general program has been deter
mined upon. Federal authorities, who
have full power to look into the situa
tion in their respective districts, were
disposed to watch for any evidences
of illegal practices. The department
of Justice has no power unless there:
is evidence of a combination or agree
ment to raise prices in articles that

one charge of this nature has been
developed.
