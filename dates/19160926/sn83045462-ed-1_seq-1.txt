EIGHT-HOUR LAW
. TOW ISSUE
Developments Indicate That
Action of Congress Will Feature
Political Campaign.
DEMOCRATS ON DEFENSIVE;
LINE UP RAILWAY WORKERS
'National Parties Are "Going to the
Mat" on Recent Legislation and
Both Sides Welcome Fight.
J BY N. O. MESSENGER.
. CHICAGO, September 26.?
'Developments continue to indicate
that the great issue of the
national political campaign for
the present at least, and until
eome turn in these days of swift
and country-wide changes shall
w ^possibly supplant it overnight, is
the action of Congress, under
pressure from President Wilson,
enforcing the eight-hour wage
day.
That the democrats are on the defensive
was shown by the President's
speech at Shadow Lawn and by what
has .since transpired. The democratic
national committee is already busying
itself lining up the railway men on the
administration's side of self-defense, and
the first of results were produced today
in a signed letter from W. G. Lee, supporting
President Wilson's course most
strenuously.
* The answer of the republicans to this
is that it is confirmatory of the charge
61' a political play by the administration
with the railway brotherhoods, to which
Seventy-odd republicans in the Houss
v. ore compelled to lend acquiescence by
the exigency of the situation, and that
the brotherhoods are now carrying out
their part of the bargain.
The purpose of this dispatch is to point
out, merely in the routine of the day's
work of describing the political situa- ,
lion as It unfolds, what part the course
k < : the President, proclaimed and de.
tided by him as humanitarian action, is
io become a burning political issue.
Both Sides Welcome Issue.
7'iere was another feature of the poluteal
end of the proposition In the
developments. The democratic na'
tional committee sent out excerpts
Iroin an editorial In Senator Lafollette's
weekly magasine, defending the
I'reatdoat. Senator Lafollette ia rnnl.lag
for re-election to the Senate on
the republican ticket in Wisconsin. He
was the only senator officially classified
as a republican who voted for the
1'residenfs bill. It is evident beyond
i dtllradiction, therefore, that the democratic
and republican national organisations
are "going to the mat" on the
?ight-bour wage legislation and both
jloes are welcoming the issue.
As stated in The Star's dispatches
Sunday, the next week or more will
witness tne democratic campaign cneerIftjr
up' and the republican campaign
taking Ha share of the knocks. Democrats
were heartened today by news
from North Dakota, where everything
* as thought to be all squegee for the
epubUcans. According to advices, the
on-Partisan Farmers' Alliance, about
hich much has been written in The
-tar's correspondence, and which will
control the state election, has been
iptured In its captaincy and bridge
a atch at least by some socialists. These
?.re favorable to President Wilson, and
if they can maintain discipline and pass
the word down to the rank and file. the
con-partisan organization may swing
to the democratic national ticket.
Puts Democrats in Quandary.
News from the state of Washington
came in today to the effect that former
Senator Turner, democratic candidate
for United States senator, has declared
for protection to Washington products,
seelcing to win the support of protectionist
republicans against Poindexter,
candidate for senator. That puts
the republicans in a quandary; they
are invited to vote for a democrat
standing for protection against a republican
who voted for the Underwood
bill. Likewise, the democrats have the
! choice of voting for a candidate who
'declares for a vital republican principle
or support a man who voted with
their party once, but is now nominated
as republican.
. ? Here is another fly in the republican
hmber. The Women's Hughes Alliance
its specially training through the west,
j Fhat's all right in spots, but it falls out
(that there are some German communities
where the Germans do not like
woman suffrage because in the end it
pells prohibition, and now the schedules
may have to be changed.
;' Now, there's a whole bunch of pollti-cal
anomalies and paradoxes. What's
.the answer? That we won't take any
jof them too seriously but regard them
11 a II til rt nf nam. an/<
that a lot of fun can be got out of
\ politics if you don't let politics obsess
you nor the politicians fool you all the
time.

Successes were achieved by

statement issued by the
German army headquarters
today. The conquest of the
villages on the line of

the statement adds, must be
recognized.
LONDON, September 26, 2
p.m.?The British have entered
Combles on the Somme front, the
war office announced today, and
are overcoming the resistance of
the Germans.
Many Prisoners Taken.
More than 1,500 prisoners, taken In
the fighting of the last twenty-four
hours, hare already been counted, and a
large amount of war material has boea
captured. The announcement follows:
"yesterday's operations were entirely
successful. The preparation and execution
of the attack by the artillery
and Infantry and the co-operation between
them were In all respects admirable.
More than 1,500 prisoners already
have passed through the collecting
stations and more are arriving.
Much war material has been captured,
but the amount cannot yet be esUmated.
"Further progress has been made during
the night and this morning. A
strong redoubt which had held out
between Lea Boeufs and Gueudecourt
now has been caDtured and the garrison
made prisoners.
"Our troops entered Combles from the
west and are overcoming the enemy's
resistance. There the enemy's loses
were very severe."
Important to Germans.
Combles, a town of some 2,000 population
before the war, had been rendered
of small strategic importance to
the allies by their long continued encircling
movement. It has been of
notable value to the Germans, however,
because as long as they clung to
it the Franco-British freedom of action
in pushing their offensive movements
toward Bapaume and Peronne, on either
j siae or 11, was xiaiupercu.
Turned into a strongly fortified position
by German defensive ingenuity, r
it has persistently held fast like a
rock in the course of a turbulent
stream that has had to be blasted loose
before the channel was fully opened up.
Long* and Costly Effort.
This process has only be accomplished
by long continued, severe and
costly effort on the part if the allies.
Driving in from the south the
French successively swept by Hardecourt,
Maurepas, Le Forest and finally
reached Fregicourt. a mile east of
Combles.
More slowly, bu* none the less ?surely,
the British have pushed their advance
on the north of the German salient.
Their struggles to reach and hold
Ginchy and Guillemont were expensive
in time and men, but finally the
ground north of Combles and some
distance to the east was occupied, put- 0
ting the town in a pocket, of which
the opening was constantly being
narrowed by the driv< ; of the entente
armies. Yesterday came the combined
effort of the French and British to
close the opening, or at least render
it so narrow that whr.t could be extracted
through it by the Germans
would not be worth while.
Only two roads remained over which
the Germans could move their men and
g;uns. The single-track railroad running
through the place had long since
t>een rendered useless.
British Occupied Korval.
Attacking from the north. Gen. Halg'a
forces rushed to and occupied Morval,

Striking from the south the French
pushed their line to Fregicourt, severng
communications with Comblea over
he southerly road?that stretching tovard
Sailly. The gap between Morval
Fregicourt, a mile and a half in
vidth and reaching back toward Com>les,
was swept from either direction

British guns.
It is not thought probable that any
sonsiderable force of Germans remained
n Combles. During the day yesterday,
rhen it was beconilng evident that the
killed forces were achieving their ob*
act of closing in east of the jtown, the
