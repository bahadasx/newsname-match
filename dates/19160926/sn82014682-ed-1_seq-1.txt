the placing of a cylinder on the wnarr
site. Gregor declared that the reason
was he had cast the letter into the
water without so much as looking to
see what it contained;
Considerable discussion hinged
about one cylinder which, it is said,

been placed in split ground and would
therefore have to be placed . deeper,
but so far no action In this Tegard has
been taken. '.-"'
Lord, with much "energy, talked so
