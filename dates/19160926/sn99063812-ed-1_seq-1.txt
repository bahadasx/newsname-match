DEMOCRATS HAVE
BROKEN PLEDGES
SPEAKER AT RALLY CRITICIZES
WILSON ADMINISTRATION
Points Out That Democrats Have
Killed to Keep Many of Their Sol
emn Obligations to People a Set
Forth in Platform Says Wilson
on Both Sides of Some Qaestions
and on Wrong Side of Others.
The failure of the democratic party
to keep its platform pledges, the weak
policy of Woodrow Wilson towards
Mexico and his lack of a positive and
determined stand on the big Issues
before the American nation were ably
set forth last evening by the Honor
able Wallace McCamant of Portland
at the republican rally that opened
the 1916 campaign In Klamath
county.
Mr. McCamant was heard by a good
sized audience that gave him close at
tention and greatly appreciated his
remarks- He Is a speaker of ability
and happily combines earnestness and
elegance with logic. His speech was
so effective that one nOtabToTCiamalh
county democrat- was heard to say
after the address:
"That man made some mighty good
points, if he Is a republican."
Mr. McCamant opened his address
by stating common ground on which
all true Americans can meet and
agree.- These were Americanism, love
of country,, desire for its prosperity,
jealousy for its honor, fulfillment of
party pledges.
On the last point the speaker laid
particular stress and showed con
clusively and clearly that the Wilson
administration had played false to the
American people by neglecting and
refusing to carry out these pledges In
the 1912 platferm:
Single term for the president.
Discontinuance of extravagance.
Lowering of the high cost of living.
Executive interference with legis
lation. Rehabilitation of the American
merchant marine.
Lowering of the tariff.
Making of ability, and not political
standing, the standard for appoint
ment to office.
Protection to citizens of America.
As to tho point made by Democratic
campaign speakers that Woodrow
Wilson has kept the United States out
of war, Mr. McCamant said in part:
"So far as the European war Is
concerned, I don't see how any presi
dent could have broken Into that war.
No power In Europe wants war with
the United States, and no power in
Europe has given us a cause for war.
But the president has not kept us out
of war. We have had war with Mex
ico; Inglorious, ignoble, Ineffective
war, but war beyond all peradventure.
Reflect on the Tamplco and the Car
dial incidents and consider it that is
not war."
The main trouble with Woodrow
Wilson's Mexican policy as set forth
by Mr. Camant Is not so much that it
has been vacillating or meddlesome,
but that the president has had the
wrong point of view.
"Instead of giving protection to
American lives and property in Mex
ico, be has tried to run the Mexican
government, to settle the agrarian
problem, with neither of which he bad
any business, nor any success," said
the speaker. "Mr. Hughes has the
proper point of view for American
leadorshtp. His slogan Is: America
first: America efficient."
Mr. McCamant was severe In his at
tack on the democratic argument that
the Wilson administration has passed
much benlflcent legislation. In turn
he showed that the rural credits law,
the antl-dumplng act, the child labor
law, the Adamson eight hour law and
the federal reserve act were wholly
ineffective measures, unworkable and
passed only to gain votes on Novem
ber 7th.
On the other hand, Mr. McCamant
pointed out the legislation passed by
republican congresses' such aa the
public land laws under which the
West had been settled and Joined with
the East, the establishment of the
credit of the American government,
the national Irrigation systems and
the building of the Panama canal. To
show Charles E. Hughes can follow In
the footsteps of his republican prede
cessors in law making, the speaker re
ferred to the insurance laws passed In
New York when Mr. Hughes was gov
ernor of that state.
Attacking the vacillating policy of
Woodrow Wilson on nearly all polit
ical Issues, Mr. McCamant said:
"President Wilson will stand out In
American history as the president
who has been on both sides of many
of the public questions of the day,
end on the wrong side of the re
mainder." He referred to Woodrow
Wilson's flop on the questions of pre
paredness, an impartial tariff com
mission, organized labor, initiative
and referendum, protective tariff, and
many others.
"Both tbe republican and demo-
eratte-partles-naTe-beem'ee-Tttt-r11!
side of all political questions at tome
time," said Mr. McCamant "The dif
ference between the two parties has
been that the republican party was on
the right side at the right time. The
democrats have been on the right side
after republican brains and repub
lican leaders have solved the great
questions. Was not the democrats
wrong on tbe question of slavery, on
Lincoln himself, on the green back
question, on the 16-to-l money pol
icy? No longer do they stand as they
did once. Apparently they have been
able to get on the right aide only
after the way had been cleared by the
party founded over half a century ago
and which has guided this nation al
most continually since the time of
Lincoln."
Mr. McCamant closed hidjjrass
by drawing a clear cut 'coapertpon
between the policy of the republican
party toward Cuba, and the Philip
pines and that of-the present admin
istration toward Mexico. "
"Early in the-administration of
President McKinley we were con
fronted with conditions of distress
and disorder on the Island of Cuba.
The aspirations of the people of Cuba
for freedom from the Spanish yoke
had borne fruit In a revolt as brave
and heroic as that of our forefathers
who had fought at Bunker Hill aud
Saratoga. In her effort to put down
this revolution the measures of Spain
wero as cruel and ruthless as In the
dayb of tbe Spanish Inquisition. Tho
republicans who wero in power at
that time wero big Americans; they
believed that tbe American people
had some responsibility for happen
ings Immediately beyond their fron
tier. They resented the destruction
of American property in Cuba, and
especially tho death of American sail
ors In Havana harbor.
"With strong arm and stout heart
they won deliverance for Cuba and
took up the white man's burden in
Porto Rice and the Philippines. In
all the history of political achieve
ment there Is no chapter more credit
able thau that which tolls the story of
American intervention in Cuba., and
the American government of Porto
Rice and tbe Philippines. It tells of
the restoration of law- and order; of
sanitary triumphs, unparalleled;: .of
yellow fever stamped, out ejtf .lerefy,
on tbe run; of schools in every settle
ment: of enlarged vision and .oeper-
tunity to peoples who had beenwUkr, Y.$
out hope." , - :&(
