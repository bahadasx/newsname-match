Marcus Kellerman, the great bari
tone artist, who pleased hiicIi a large
audience at the Maysville Chautauqua
during the Reason of Will give n
concert In this city on Tuesday, No
vember -Mat, tor the benefit of the Ma
un County lleulth league' automo
bile fund
It will be remembered that several
months ago It wns suggested that :i
fund be started for the purpose of pur
chaalng the Mason County Health
I.eaKue'a Visiting Nurse with an au
tomobile. There wbb a noat little. aum
contributed to this fund but the plan
aeemed to lag and nothing has been
ili no toward Increasing the fund for
some time.
Through the efforts of Hanker H. C.
Sharp, the local League had the op
portunity to secure Mr. Kellermannri
his company for the above date and
they thought this would be a splendid
opportunity to again revive the Auto
mobile Fund. Arrangements are now
under way to have Mr. Kellerman, to
gether with his violinist and pianist
hfre on November 21st for the purpose
ot Increasing this fund.
There needs be no argument in fa
vor of the proposition of purchasing
this machine for all know that with
the assistance of an automobile the
Visiting Nurse will be able to make
more visits in the city and county and
make them more promptly. Mr. Kel
lerman and his company of artists will
need no introduction of a Maysville
audience for all of those who heard
him at the Chautauqua a year ago are
advertisers of his company. He is
recognized as one of the best male
singers in the country and bis assist
ing artists are experts on their In
struments. Mr. Kellerman has submitted a very
attractive program to the local peo
ple and the matter will be gone into
more thoroughly this week. More
about the entertainment will be made
public in a very few days and all
should begin making plans now to at
tend this entertainment by three of
America's ereatest artists for the
benefit of a good cgusc.

Kev. Jones Is not a stranger to the
Maysville people, having held one of
the most successful meetings the
church has had in many a year; also
he was Evangelist for the Bracken As
sociation and pastor of the Iewlsburg
Church. He has almost a genius for
making friends, whether among thuJ
educated and refined of the commun

l education and social position, and
once you come under the charm of
his personality and the magic of his
conversation Is to acknowledge his
power and Influence. He is an Intense
Br.pt 1st and can tell why and never
loses a suitable opportunity to do so.
His fidelity to New Testament religion
and Baptist faith has been Impressed
upon the Baptists over a large area
of Northern Kentucky. Maysville !s
indeed proud to know that such a
fearless man ijlml will come Into her
midst and wishes him abundant suc
cess in hiB new field.
