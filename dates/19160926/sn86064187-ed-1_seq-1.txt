Local Council and Master Idea
Appeals to Prominent Men
Who Discuss Plan,
If the plans of prominent business
and professional men in Oklahoma City
go through and they never allow their
plans to fail -there will be SIX) boy
scouts registered in this citv before
camping time next year and all will be
under the general jurisdiction of a scout
commissioner and local council, com
posed of the biggest men in town.
A meeting of prominent men was held
last night and fifteen were tentatively
selected as the council. Thev will meet
next Tuesday night at the First Luther
an church to perfect organization and,
perhaps, elect a scout commissioner.
The gathering was exceedingly enthu
siastic. It is probable that a call will be is
sued for all boy scouts in Oklahoma
City to assemble Friday, school chil
dren's day, at the State Fair grounds
and hold a meeting there to create un
usual enthusiasm in the work. It is
also likelv that a mass meeting to pro
mote enthusiasm and membership will
tie held in the city shortly.
The tentative council's plan is said
to be establishment of districts, to be so
distributed that every hoy in the city
may become a member of the scouts
and alt receive, the same instruction
once a week.
