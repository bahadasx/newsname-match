SIX MURDERED BY
REAL CANNIBALS
Sydney, Australia, Sept. 26.—A
steamer arriving from the New Heb

northeastern coast of Australia, has
brought news of the murder of six
persons by cannibals. The victims
were a British trader named R. J.
Bridges, and at least five children,
whose bodies were found fearfully
mutilated with axes and knives, and
another child who is missing, is be
lieved to have been carried off by
the cannibals and feasted upon. The
murderers were thought to have come
from a village on Malekula island,
where there are tribes of cannibals
who are bound by native custom to
kill and eat a human being in order
to keep up their rank.
The failure of the French and Brit
ish punitive expeditions just before
the outbreak of the European war to
capture any of the perpetrators of
similar crimes, and their immunity
from punishment for two years past
on account of the war, is thought re
cently to have emboldened the canni
bals.<p></p>SIX

Combles Has Been of Great Importance to Allies in Drivfl
Toward Bapaume and Peronne—Monday
Was Exceptionally Great Day.
London, Sept. 26.—British and French troops toda^
reached the town of Combles, on the Somme front, after,
having virtually pocketed the place in a struggle of many}
weeks' duration, and are fighting to gain complete posses
sion of it. Attacking from the north, the British forced
their way into the place, London reports, and are over
coming the German resistance. On the south, the French'
reached the town's edge and penetrated the cemetery. In
addition, they have further closed the small opning left in
the Combles pocket by capturing all of the village of Fregi-*
court, a mile to the east.
The Combles salient, doggedly maintained by the Ger
mans. has long been a serious hindrance to the allies, ham-'
pering their offensive toward Bapaume and Peronne. Itsj
elimination, however, seemed imminent after yesterday's
combined thrust by the Franco-British forces, which car
ried them to Morval on one side, and Fregicourt on the
other, leaving a narrow stretch swept by machine guns as
the Germans' only avenufc. of retreat.
Combles, a town of 2,000 population before the war^
had been rendered of smatt^s,trategic importance to the al
lies by their long continued encircling movement. It had
been of notable value to the Germans, however, because
as long as they clung to it, the Franco-British freedom of
action in pushing their offensive movements towards Ba
paume and Peronne on either side of it was hampered.
Turned into a strongly fortified position by the German
defensive ingenuity, it persistently held fast like a rock in
the course of a turbulent stream that has had to be blasted'
loose before the channel fully was opened up.
TERRIFIC FIGHT MONDAY. I
British Front in France, (via London). Sept. 26.—Monday was-an
other great day for the Anglo-French forties on the Somme. As a
spectacle for the observer, it was the most splendid of all the attacks
made by the Allied forces since the commencement of the great offen
sive. What cither army is trying to do and how they are doing it,
what positions they held and they sought to conquer in the team play
of the blue French legions and the khaki-dad brigades of the Brit
ish, was comprehensible to the eye in the glorious autumn sunlight
for a sweep of ten miles.
The scene had an intoxication of war's grandeur.
Tonight, the British liave taken halt of Morval and all of lies,
boeuf, and adranced their line on a front of 8.000 yards for an average
depth of 1,000 yards. The French have stormed Ranoourt and
pushed their line to the outskirts to the little village of Fregicourt, a
mile to the east, and a little north of Combles.
The German stronghold of Combles Is virtually Isolated.
GERMAN'S ADMIT ENTENTE SUCCESSES. "1
Berlin. Sept. 26.—(Via wireless to Sayville.)—The successes

The Russians made six attacks with a strong force against the
Austro-Germans near Manajowa, iii Galicia. but failed, with the heart*
est losses for the Russians.
Rumanian troops again occupied the heights on both sides of Szur
