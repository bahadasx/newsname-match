Plea for New Hospital
For the Indigent Sick
Superintendent Calls Conditions
At Washington Asylum "De
plorable and Pitiful."
INSTITUTION TQ0 CROWDED
Present Buildings Also Laolring
in Modern Apparatus for
Treatment of Cases.
Characterizing as "deplorable and pit
iful" conditions at tho Washington
Asylum Hospital, recently described In
a series of articles In The Times, L.
F. Zlnkhan, superintendent of the In
stitution, In his annual report to the
Board of Charities for the year ended
June SO, sgaln urges that adoquato
provision be made for the Indigent sick
of the District.
The appropriation In the Commis
sioners' estimates for a new munici
pal hospital was not made at the last
session of Congress. This was due. In
part, It was understood, to protests
mado by residents of tho northwest
section against the location of 'the In
stitution on a site owned by tho Dis
trict at Fourteenth ond Upshur streets.
Superintendent Zlnkhan urges if
there are to ba further delavs In
acquiring a new hospital that Immedi
ate efforts be made for obtaining a
psychopathic ward In tho old Institu
tion.
Outlines Alcoholics' Treatment.
"In the same ward we treated 618 cases
of acute alcoholism and thirty-nine
cases of morphinism," he says In his
report. "It Is all wrong to treat this
variety of cases In the same ward. Al
coholics should be treated In an in
ebrlato asylum; most of them on an
Indefinite sentence In the workhouse,
where. In addition to adequate treat
ment, they could bo given plenty of
work, which Is so essential In bringing
about a physical restoration. A strict
enforcement of the pharmacy law will
gradually reduce the, number of vic
tims of the drug habit.
"if there are to be further delaj In
securing a new hospital our efforts
should be concentrated on getting an
Immediate appropriation for a psycho
patio ward."

Captured in Fortress
FRENCH CAPTURE
Germans Used Captured Fortress for Weeks
As Base of Their Defense of Somme
Line From Bapaume to
Peronne.
By ED. L; KEEN.
LONDON, Sept. 26. Gambles, keypoint of the whole
German battle line from Bapaume to Peronne, has been cap
tured by the British after eighteen hours of most furious
battling north of the Somme.
General Haig this afternoon announced that British
troops entered Combles, overcoming German resistance.
The enemy's losses, the official report said, were severe.
Fighting was still going on in some places in the streets
of Comble when General Haig's report was filed.
The British victory, achieved after three weeks of des
perate driving against the German center, is the most strik
ing single achievement of the whole Somme offensive. It
removes one of the last two" obstacles to an Anglo-French
thrust to squeeze the Germans out of Peronne, one of the
two objectives of the great allied advance.
CLIMAX OF DAY OF VICTORIES.
The capture of Combles followed a day and night of
most brilliant allied successes, including the capture of the
villages of Morval and Les Boeufs by the British, and Ran
court and Fregicourt by the French. In summing- up the
day's successful operations, General Haig reported that
l.Soo Germans were captured by the British and that more
prisoners are being brought in. The work of listing large
supplies of war material also captured' has not been com
pleted. Combles fell after thrusts by both British' and French
in yesterday's fighting drew a noose about the German gar
rison which made their escape almost impossible.
For weeks the Germ'ans had used the town, with its
wonderful system of fortifications, as a pivot point from
which to swing attacks north and south at the allies' lines.
In the last month of fighting, the British and French lines
pressed steadily forward on both sides, until the town was
in a deep pocket. It was no longer available for the Ger
mans as a pivotal point, but it still held out;- buttressing the
German line and'blocking a further allied advance.
DRIVE NEARER TO BAPAUME.
The British not only gained this important victory, but
pressed forward in their drive toward Bapaume last night
and early today. A strong redoubt between Les Boeufs and
Guerdecourt fell before a British attack.
The French also swept forward again last night, carry
ing Fregicourt village and later repulsing German attacks
against positions won yesterday.
Berlin Admits Losses

BERLIN (via wireless to Sayville), Sept. . 26. The
loss of villages to the allied forces under one of the most
terrific attacks of the whole Somme offensive, was officially

"The allied infantry, after a four-day artillery duel,
launched a uniform attack between the Ancre and the
