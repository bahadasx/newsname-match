SHOULD THE NUDE IN
ART BE SHOWN IN
MOTION PICTURES?
Should the nude in art be shown in motion picture*?
Ted Shawn, the husband and dancing partner of Ruth
St. Denis, said in The Star the other day that athletic dances
will be interpreted in the nude by dancers on the American
stage in 10 year*.
Now along come* Jame* Q. Clemmer, owner of the Clem
mer theatre, with an appeal to movie patrons to vote on
whether the mmie hnuw* ehall heat the dancer* by 10 y*>ar*
by showing art pose* in the nude.
Fact is. his theatre will show Audrey Munson, famous
artist's model, in the nude in a seven-reel picture entitled,
"Purity." beginning next Saturday.
That's putting it up to the patrons of the movies, who,
so film producers say. are the final judges of what shall ap
pear in reel life thrillers, to say their say on whichever side
of the question they please.
Shall the famous paintings of women and men in the
nude be displayed in art store windows, art galleries, puhhc
libraries, etc.. and faijious poses of nude women in motion
pictures be barred?
That'* just another angle of the question.
Thru The Star, I lcmmer will pay $.V) in ca*h prize* and
20 pair* of complimentary ticket* to the Clemmer to those
who write the 12 be*t letter* for or against showing the
nude in art in the movies.
