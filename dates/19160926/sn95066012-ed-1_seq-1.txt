Gov. Whitman Urged to Convene
Special Session
BIG TIE-UP DUE TOMORROW
Thirteen Persons Injured in First
Subway Accident Since
Strike Began.
New York, Sept. 88. With labor
leaders continuing their efforts to
bring about a general suspension of
work as an aid to the striking carmen
members ol the state Legislature
from the metropolis at a meeting late
yesterday decided to urge Gov. Whit
man to convene the Legislature in ex
traordinary session to deal With the
strike situation. The governor ar
rived in the city last night, and it was
expected a committee appointed by
the legislators would wait upon him
today. The labor leaders have set
tomorrow as the time for a general tie
up of the city's industries. Nearly
41) per cent of the 800,000 union work
ers in New York and neighborhood
have avowed their intention of quit
ting their places, according to Hugh
Frayne, organizer of the American fed
eration of labor.
The first accident on a subway line
since the transit strike began the fith
occurred yesterday. Thirteen per
sons were injured, two seriously, in a
rear-end collision at the Two Hundred
and Seventh-street station, on that
part of the subway system running on
an elevated structure above the street
It was said the motornian of the rear
train leaped from his post and allowed
the train to crash into the rear of a
train Btanding jit the station. He was
arrested later.
Sporadic attempts at Violence and
several arrests in connection with the
strike were reported by the police.
The garnd jury, which is investigating
charges of disorder and other unlaw
ful at. in connection with the strike,
was charged by the court yesterday
not to give any consideration to a
pamphlet dealing With alleged elisor
ders sent to the Jurors by Theodore P
Shonts, president of the Interborough
rapid transit company an dthe New
York railways company. The docu
ment did not constitute legal evidence
the court said.

RUSSIAN DRIVE LOSING SPEED
Counterattacks by Von Hindenburg's
Forces Checking Brusiloff's
Offensive.
Potrograd, Sept. 25. Although the
official communications have shed lit
tle light on recent developments in the
war situation, it. is learned from stall
officers that after a long lull the bat
tles at ail important points on General
llrusiloff's front are again assuming
the intensity which characterized the
first period of his advance.
The principal centres of action are
the districts near Vladiiuii -Volytiski
ind west of Lutsk, the Halicz region
and the Carpathians, and in each of
these territories there lias been a gen
eral resumption of the fighting. Whicti
has spread to adjacent sectors until
the whole southwestern war theatre
from the Prlpot Marshes to the Dan
ube may be said to be again in action
I'he nature ol this action, however,
is undergone a consplcous change
sine- the iirst smashing blows in
Brusiloff's campaign.
Although the Russians still claim
the initiative, it is evident that the
Herman counter attacks are becoming
constantly more trequent and more
vigorous, and in the large numbers ot
reintorceineiits sent to these regions
from other fronts, as well as the more
aggressive character of the German
fighting, there are signs that
field Marshal von lllndenburg. the
new cliler of start, is planning a new
campaign to recover the old positions
before winter sets in.
To meet this the Russian! have al
ready berOn n fresh ofrsensivp. the de
tails of which has been undertaken on
a large scale with the object of mak
ing a desperate effort to pierce the
Austro-German fronts before the fall
campaign is over.
Great reticence is observed by th
war office, which in an oliicial bulletin
today merely said that no events of
importance had occurred.

Prospective Strike in Sympathy By
Metal Workers in Schenectady
May Complicate Situation.
Pittsfield, Sept. 2C "Deadlocked"
accurately describes the condition of
the General electric strike. It is no
nearer settled now than it was four
weeks ago. Negotiations carried on
by the state board of conciliation and
arbitration members since a week ago
yesterday have brought about no
change whatever in the demands of
the strikers or in the terms of the
company. There are four points at is
sue hours, wages, shop committees
and lelnstatemeiit of discharged un
ion men. No adjustment has been
made .in any of them. No further
conferences are in sight according to
the company and the strikers.
Much depends on the action of the
Schenectady (N. Y.) metal trades
council Thursday night when it meets
to decide whether it will strike Fri
day morning in sympathy. Union
leaders said yesterday tha 400 less
people entered the Pittsfield plant
yesterday morning than Saturday. A
company representative; stated that
there was no gain In employes yester
day. The strikers' publicity com
mittee made it plain yesterday that
It has not receded. a single bit from
the counter-proposition of a week ago
yesterday.
General Manager C. C. Chesney of
the Pittsfield plant said yesterday
that statements from the state board
of conciliation and arbitration, and
other statements, do uot affect the
company, "! have not seen any of
them (state board members) since
Friday," he said. The company denies
making any concessions to the strik
