BATTALION DANCE
fl IT
i
The first battalion, Fourth In
fantry, gave a delightful entertain
ment and dance in Lihue Social
hall Saturday evening. Owing to
bad .weather the attendane was not
large,' but what , was- lacking in
numbers was made up, perhaps, -in
the excellence of the entertainment.
The decorations were the prettiest
seen at Lihue Social hall in a long
time, being the handiwork of a com
mittee of iirst battalion olliccrs and
' willing assistance. Music was sup-'
plied by an Hawaiian orchestra.
The dance was preceded by a pic
ture show in thti hall, put on by
Wm. Fernandez. A number of ex
cellent, special features wore dis
played. After the show the hall
was cleared and dancing began,
lasting to a late .h'omv
, The receipts of the evening were
not large but probably covered all
expenses and left a small balance
for'thc baseball fund, for the bene
which the affair was given.

ELI PRECIPICE
Sheriff Rice has received the pa
pers in -the case of a coroner's in
quiry into the death of one Domingo
Sallas, a PortolJican boy aged 12, on
the hills above Lawai. From the evi
dence brought out it appears that the
lad went out to gather firewood. He
did not return that afternoon nor
night and the next day a search
was instituted for him. This tuirrh
was kept up for two days, the body
being found finally at the base of a
thirty-foot precipice from which he
had evidently fallen The skull was
fractured and there were -otheY in
juries to head and shoulders.
A number of witnesses were ex
amined hut none seemed to know
anything further than that the boy
Jeft the houso for the hills and that
the body was found 'in the position
indicated. Dr. - Watcrhousc, who
examined the body shortly after it
was found, testified as to the injuries
discovered.
Tho jury returned a verdict to
the effect that the lad came to his
death as the result of a fall of 30
feet from a rocky precipice, striking
and crushing his skull on a rock,
dying instantenously, and due to
his own carelessness.

A luna named Christy, employed
by the Hawaiian Sugar Co., at Ma
kawcli, was struck with a Jioe by a
Filipino yesterday morning and so
badly injured that lie had to be tak
en to the Makawcli hospital for

ed late" for work and was reprimand
ed by the luna. The- attack ensued.
The Filipino has been arrested and
, will be given a hearing as soon as
the injured man isable to testify
against htm.

01 FOUND DEAD
MAIL AUTO 160
Annie Lee, aged S or 'J, a part
Hawaiian and Korean school girl,
was struck by the Haimlei maii
auto, driven by Joseph I, near thr
residence of Dr. Putmah, Lihue,
early yesterday afternoon and, now
lies in a somewhat uncertain condi
tion in the Lihue hospital.
Investigation by the police secured
to show the facts to lnve been as
ollows: The car was proceeding
toward Lihue and the child going
toward Hanamaulu from the Lihue
school.' When very close the little
girl appeared to become confused
and ran almost in front of the auto,
which at that time was on the right
side of the road. Mr. I hastily
veered tho car to the left, but
the child continued on across in tho
same. direction and was caught by a
wheel, and cithe.r by accident or a
return of mental faculties, managed
to get under the car, thereby es
caping being run over and crushed.
Mr. I stopped the machino as
quickly as' possible, (licked up the
child and rushed her to the hospital
where she was given immediate at
tention. It was at first thoiight the
injuries were very slight, but later
in the evening faint evidences of
internal injuries appeared. It will,
therefore, probably be a day or two
before the fate of the little mite
will be definitely known.
Upon leaving the hospital Mr. I
went straight to Sheriff Rice and
reported the accident. No arrest
was made, tho sheriff deciding to
await developments and the results
of more complete investigation.
Mr. I is tho mail driver on the
Ilanalei route and is at present a
candidate for nomination to the
Legislature.
LARRI50N DREAMS
OF PARK
Mr. Larrison, the head -water
man, had the following to say to
the Star-Bulletin upon liis return to
Honolulu last week :
Plans for the conversion of a
largo area of land in the upper poi
tions of the Waimea-Kekaha section
of Kauai into a territorial or even a
national park have been studied out
by George K. Larrison-, superinten
dent of hydrography, during a rc
eei)t trip to the Garden Island, and
will be presented to Governor Pink
ham. Larrison ,will present the matter
to the governor, however, only as a
private citizen might not through
any official chpacity as head of tho
territoriaUhydrographic work.
"1 shall boost this plan as you
or any other citizen might," he tells
the Star-Bulletin, "because I believe
it would be a wonderful thing for
tho islands."
Spending a few days and nights
camping in tho very heart of tno
proposed area, waking up in tho
morning to read the mercury at 30
degrees four ' above freezing and
.getting breakfast over a wood fire,
the smoke of which lifted straight
up into the crisp, cold air, Larrison
got his big idea.

Richard L. Hughes, assistant
manager of the Kauai Railway, has
been extremely ill for a week, al
though yesterday there was a turn
for the better and today his condi
tion seems much improved. He is
in the Elee'lo hospital where he is
being attended by Dr. Waterhouse.
Mr. Hughes went to the hospital
Saturday, last week, suffering from
an attack of appendicitis. He was
operated on Monday and on Tues
day appeared to beuloing very well.
On Wednesday, however, symptoms
of pneumonia appeared ami the fol
lpwing day the temperature of the
patient had risen to a point which
gave much alarm. Dr. Putman was
called in as consulting physician.
The situation remained critical
until Sunday when there was a
slight change for the better. Rest
ful sleep that night brought further
slight improvement yesterday, and
last night Dr. YVaterhoure reported
that the patient was doing well al
though, of course, still not entirely
out of danger, for such cases are un
certain for "several days. Much re
liance is placed iii the splendid phy
sical trim of Sir. Hughes, which
lias" already aided greatly in the
combat upon the ailment with which
he is suffering.
Mr. and Mrs. John A. Scott, of
Hilo, parents of Mrs. Hughes, weie
