BRAND PUTS "PEP" IN
REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN
Colonel Wllbnr H. Brand, of Fairmont, Who Is Called (lie "Pepperbox"
iU Republican State Headquarters.
In every organization there must be
"pep" in order to bring the desired
result. This is particularly true of
political organizations. The Republi
can party this year has all the ''pep"
in its campaign that could be desired,
and most of it emanates from Colonel
Wilbur H. Brand, of Fairmont, who ia
styled the "pepperbox" at Republican
state headquarters here. Colonel
llrand ia assistant secretary of the
state executive committee. Chairmen
from counties that aro overwhelmingly
Democratic may come to Btate head
quarters feeling a little discouraged,
hut aftor talking with Brand they go
away In a happier mood?determined
to reduce that Democratic majority.
Colonel Brand, who Is well known
and popular throughout tho northern
part of West Virginia, was born and
raised in Marlon county and now re
sides at Fairmont. Although compara
tively a young man he has had plenty
of experience in the political game
and is regarded by older heads as an
astute politician. In 1896, then only
a mere boy, he was secretary of tho
Marion county Republican executive
committee and the ability he showed
In that campaign caused tho older poli
ticians to sit up and take notice In
the following year he was vice presi
dent of the West Virginia league of
Republican Clubs. Ho was for several
years assistant postmaster at Fair
mont, discharging the duties of that
ofllec In a manner that pleased every
one.
Colonel Brand's latest political
achievement was in the primary cam
paign this year when he served as
campaign manager In Marlon county
for both Judge Robinson and William
F. Hlte. The result In Marion shows
better than anything else tho success
ful manner in which he conducted the
campaign. Robinson received a ma
jority of 1.417 In the county, and Hlte
a plurality of 351. This was consid
ered by politicians all over tho state
as the best showing made by any coun
ty in the state, and no ono doubts that
the credit should go to Colonol llrand,
for it was ills great executive ability
that organized tho county nnd made It
a stronghold for the two men ne repre
sented.

works using waht Is known aa the
"rapid sand" pystom of filtration. The
Clarksburg plant, completed In 1011,
