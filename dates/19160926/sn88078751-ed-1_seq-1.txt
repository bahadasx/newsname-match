Baltimore, Sept 25. President Wil
son arrived hero today to speak before
tho National Grain Dealers associa
tion. He expects to amplify his posi
tion on tho settlement of tho recently
threatened railroad strike outlined in
his speech at Shadow Lawn Saturday.
Ho will do this on tho theory that the
grain dealers are interested in tho
question us shippers. Ho was nuioi
encouraged by the iocelpt of several
hundred telegvamB praising Satur
day's address. ,
The rural credits law, tlio federal
rceorvo act, and other legislation of
bis administration of interest to farm
ers, also will be referred to by the

vote his attention chiefly to the eight
hour law for railroad employes.
This subject, which tho president
now considers one of the chief Issues
of the campaign, will bo featured by
Mr. Wilson in virtually every speech
he makes. He will reply to the charge
that tho eight hour law was forced
through congress by threats of 'a
strike, with the statement that he In
sisted on tho law bocauso ho believed
It right.

REVENTLOW IN A FURY
German Count Would End Neutral Re
lief For Belgians.
London, Sopt. 25. According to ad
vices received here from Berlin,'
Count Beventlow is conducting a furk
ous agitation to end relief for the Bel
gians. Tho idea that American assist
ance, now given to Belgians, should
be extended to Belgium stirs him to
fury. He says: "Get rid at one stroke
of American and othor rellof works.
Wo know those neutral oiuciais irom
our experience of tho situation cro
ntcd in the western occupied terri
tories by tho introduction of tho Amer
ican fund relief commission. We must
Insist upon the nonsensical character
of tho 'suggestion that in tho mid
dle of this great strugglo a neutral
power and such a neutral power as
tho United States of Amorlca, who
foavo always stood politically in the
camp of tho enemies who seek to do
atroy us should b9 permitted to ex
ercise oven a shadow of 'control' in
tho territories occupied by Germany
and. Jn consequence, in Germany it
self. Tho noxious character of such
a situation is evident."

TWO ZEPPELINS LOST
L
Took Heavy Toll of Lives Be-;
foro Their Destruction,
London, Sept 25. Of the, twelve big
Zeppelins which Invaded the British
Islos to deal death and destruction
from the skies two ' are now black
masses of steel and aluminum in the
little village' of Mangold, Essex coun
ty. They fell victims of the autl-air
craft defenses of London and outlying
districts.
Ono came down a flaming torch,
while tho second, disabled by gun Are,
effected n landing, which saved the
lives of the crew, who are prisoners
In England. The crew ot the ilrst
raider died in the consuming flames
of their own ship.
The death and burning of the first
Zeppelin was witnessed by tens ot
thousands of London's residents, but
tho wounding and descent of the sec-,
ond raider was a matter of doubt un
til the omcial statements wore given
out.
The raiders took a heavy toll of
lives before their destruction, 28 per-
sons being killed and 99 wounded in
the metropolitan district of London.
Two persons were killed, probably
four, and 17 were wounded, in the
provinces.
Tho property damage, while widely
distributed. Is confined for the most
part to smnll suburban dwellings and
shops, although one railway station
was dnmnged, some empty cars being
destroyed and part of the tracks
torn up.

long before tho Portuguese uniform
Is seen on the battle front. The first
contingent of the republic's expedi
tionary force is on the eve of dopar
turo, but its destination Is a secret
The special training of tho Portuguese
troops seem to qualify them for a
mountain campaign, as ln the Bal
kans; but popular feeling In France
as In Portugal, is in favor of theii
fighting on the western front. British
and French staff officers and military
instructors directed the training of
Portugal's reservists and now levies.
Should the war be prolonged, It is ex.
peeled the field army of tho republic
Will reach 225.000 men.

Cooper's Vote In Favor of General
Walkout Elevated Trains Attacked,,
but Traffic Is Normal.
New York, Sept 23. While several
unions representing various trades
met and discussed plans for the
threatened "suspension ot work" Wed
nesday, in aid of the car men who
quit their places Sept 6, active picket
ing of the transit lines which have
been declared "unfair" by organized
labor was begun by thousands of men
and women.
Sentinels were posted throughout
the city to watch ,for union men rid
ing on the cars. All cases of the kind
will be reported to the unions to
which the men belong and fines will
be assessed, it was said.
Eight hundred coopers affiliated
with the longshoremen's union, it was
announced, voted in favor of a gen

action, however, .until a definite deci
sion is reached by Hie" longshoremen,,
it was tud.
Except for sporadic attacks against
elevated railway trains by men lurk

continued normal, while surface car
travel showed improvement What
few attacks there were upon cars were
of a minor character, according to the
police. No one was injured.
Jitneys and various other vehicles
pressed Into service during the strlki
