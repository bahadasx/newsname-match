SUNDOWN TOOK
GAMBLER'S CHANCE
Indian, VIh Won Championship,
Itude Without Hulking Rolls and
Willi Plain Hallor Hope.
While the great crowd at Round-Up
Park was almust a unit Saturday In
approving of the decision of the
Judges in making Jackson Sundown
champion broncho buster, It is doiibl
Cul If there were a half dozen that
knew the points upon which the deci
sion wan made.
The Indian made by far the must
sensational ride and this was what
made him the favorite of the crowd.
Many, too. saw that he gpurrrd his
horsp to Its best efforts, which was a
fisctor given strong consideration by
the Judges A few saw the. Judges ex
amining the saddles of the three men
In the finalw before their rides and
this examination had something to do
with their decision.
Rollen. who won second money on
Long Tom, rode wth a saddle upon
which there were ;arge, square-cut
bucking rolls, under which he could'
lock his knees. He also used hi own.
halter rupe which was of cotton and
braided and platted at the end so
that it gave him a good grip and
made It almost Impossible for a horse
to pull the rope through his hand.
The Indian used-an old saddle with
a slick tree, that is there were no
bucking rolls on it for helping him
keep his seat. He also used the plain
halter furnished by the Round-Up.
The rules of the contest permit the
use of saddle. with bucking rolls and
also of the buckaroo's own halter rope
but they count against the rider pro
viding another contestant does no-
take the same advantages of his
mount.
The Indian used big wide, flapping
chaps and this made his ride appear
sensational to the crowd but real!
prevented those who know good rid
ing from feeing Just now good a ride
the Nez Perce was malting. The
Judges were close at hand and could.
Rollen, who Is undoubtedly a
champion rider, never took his spurs
out of the cinch during his ride ot
Iong Tom. Men who were In the
arena declare that cowboys familiar
with Long Tom's style of bucking, ad
vised Rollen, who had never been at
a Round-Up befcire, to ride the big
sorrel safe else he would be taking
big chances of losing out altogether.
Sundown took a gambler's chance. I

The Happy Canyon pavilion will be
completed nt once, the directors at a
meeting yesterday afternoon having
decided to finish the work which was
stopped when the show began. All
that is necessary for the completion
of the structure is the putting on ot
the roof of the grandstand.
Though the association has a
dei,
flcit of J500Q as a result of the heavy
expense of buying the lease, building
tho pavilion and staging the show, it
was decided that It was best to root
the grandstand in order to protect tht
seats from the weather.
The matter ot renting the dance
hall during the year was left to the
president, secretary, treasurer anil

TEACHERS FAVOR
PENDLETON BILL
News has reached the normal

wholly on the ability of teach

successes. Fifteen hundred prisoners were taken. The
French also advanced, seizing Fregcourt and captured a Ger
man company southwest of Combles. Forty seven air duels
were fought and nine German machines wrecked.
