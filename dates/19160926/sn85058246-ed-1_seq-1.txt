went direct to Weiilir, Idaho whero
they met Mr, Ilrockman and Mr.
Brown, real estato dealors: and Mr.
I West Cashier of tho First National
Bank of Weaser, who they found to
bo very gentlomenly, kind and courte
ous. They furnished automobiles and
took tho Cache Valley party pretty
woli ovor the adjacent country, In
cluding the farming district and show
ed pretty largely all the lands they
had listed.
Tho entire party was well Impress
ed with tho country and Roy Parker
purchased 40 acres of land near
Wcaser and Mr. Stewart and Mr.
Perkins are considering the purchaso
of two tracts of land. Whilo in
Wciser tho visitors wero royally
treated by the leading business men
of that thrifty city. A banquet was
given in honor of tho visiting guests,
which was thoroughly appreciated, by
I tho Cache Valley boys.
Tho crops aro reported to bo good
nt Weaser this year, especially tho
alfalfa, corn and potatoes. The land
Is very productive and tho farmers
havo an 'exceptionally good yield of
bay this season.
i After leaving Weaser tho party
,came back to Ontario. There they
attended farmer oxhlblt.whiolr'was
very interesting. At this exhibit a hog
was seen which weighed 980 pounds
and an eight year old steer which
weighed 3340 pounds. From Ontario
a visit was made at Caldwell wi

In width tho reservoir Is nbout CO

EDISON'S
FAVORITE
CREATION
Thomas A. Edison says that ho
has at last succeeded in recreating
tlio human volco so perfectly upon
tho now Edison phonograph, that tho
roKireatlon cannot bo distinguished
from tho original. Ho also states
that no ncodlo typo talking machine
daro placo tho singer in direct com
parison with their machines in Uko
manner. He further stutos that tho
now Edison is tho only machlno that
gets away from that whlnoy phono-'
graph ono. In ovidenco wo quote
the following from tho Boston Her
ald of Novembor 21, 1915: I
Anynno who yostorday hoard Miss '
MUIer'a volco swelling out through '
tho auditorium and then heard thats
volco superbly matched in all tho do
llcato variations of tono and color by
tho lnstiument cannot fall to bo im
pressed by tho almost human quali
ties of Edlsou's invention.
Perhaps tno artistic merit of Mr.
Edison's Invontlon can In no way bo
well bo attested as by tho fact that
COO members of the Handel and Hay
dyn Society of Boston woro yester
day Bcated In Symphony Hall.
