Helm Puts It On Owens
Local .Congressman Vigorously Up
holds Wilson in Joint Debate
Congressman Harvey Helm "put it
all over" former Congressman W. C.
Owens, of Louisville, in a joint de
bate between them as Springfield, in
Washington county Monday, accord
ing to the correspondent of the Courier-Journal
in today's paper. The
tall congressman from Lincoln is
proving a powerful advocate of Pres
ident Woodrow Wilson and his poli
cies on the stump in the present cam
paign and there is a big demand for
him outside of his own district. The
C-J. said of the Springfield speaking:
Springfield, Sept. 25 Both the
Democratic and Republican cam
paigns opened in this county today,
the occasion being marked by a joint
debate between Congressman Harvey
Helm, of the Eighth district, repre
senting the Democrats, and W. C.
Owens, of Louisville, Republican
nominee for congress. Congressman
Helm was introduced by John A. Po
lin and spoke an hour, after which
Mr. Owens was introduced by W. F.
Neikirk Mr. Owen? spoke for over
an hour, at th end of which, accord
ing to agreement, Mr Helm spoke 15
minates in reply. There was a large
crowd in town, Democrats being in
the majority, and the courthouse was
filled to capacity during the speaking.
The speech of Congressman Helm was
an able one. Mr. Owens was unable
to make a successful attack upon a
single act of the Administration. En
thusiasm reached its maximum when
Congressman Helm began his reply.
Turning to Mr. Owens he asked him
whether, if elected, he would intro
duce a resolution in congress looking
to a declaration of war on Mexico.
Evading the question, Mr. Owens
said: "You were in congress; why
didn't you do it?" The Republicans
had great confidence in their man as
a debater and went into the court
house with a great deal of enthusiasm
which was soon dispelled when the
tall Congressman from the Eighth
began his reply. Mr. Owens was
bested throughout and at the close
of the debate all the enthusiasm was
on the Democratic side.
HELM SPEAKS IN SOUTH END.
Congressman Harvey Helm spoke
to about 50 voters at Waynesburg
Saturday afternoon and to fully 150
people at Kings Mountain that night.
He was given splendid attention and
his talks were well received. He in
troduced himself at Waynesburg, but
at Kings Mountain Dr. C. M. Thomp
so did it and did it nicely. From
his visits to various sections of the
county Congressman Helm is satis
fied that democracy is in good fight
ing shape for the November eletcion
and that in the district and State
everything is alright.

Big Crowd Hears Thorne
Congressman Kincheloe Was Detain
ed Mule Buyers On Hand.
A good crowd attended court at
Lancaster Monday and mules were
there by the hundreds. Buyers and
sellers were far apart, however, and
many of the hybrids did not change
hands. Dick Gentry, of Boyle, pick
ed up three nice mare mules, three
to four years old, at $200 to $225
They were choice ones. War and
worK muies Drougnt all the way
from $110 to $157.50. Mule colts
were slow and there were few sales
compared with the number on mar
ket. Those sold brought from $60
to $110. James Hutchins, formerly
of Hubble, bought one of Ben Hud
son at the latter figure. The ruling
prices were $75 to $90. There were
probably 200 cattle at the pens, but
on account of dry weather and the
scarcity of grass trade was not brisk,
A bunch of good, 800-pound steers
brought 7c; some heifers, about the
same weight, sold at 6c; butcher stuff
was slow at 4c to 5c and canners
were hard to sell at any price.
As Congressman D. H. Kincheloe,
of the Second district, was unable to
come as scheduled, ex-Lieut. Gov. W.
P. Thorne addressed a large gather
ing of democrats at the court-house
in the afternoon after a handsome
introduction by Editor Joe E. Rob
inson, of the Central Record. Gov.
; Thorne made one of his character
istic old time, democratic speeches,
which should have good effect with
the sturdy democracy of Garrard.
The court-house was turned over to
the republicans at 3 o'clock and
Hon. King Swope, of Danville, was
presented 'to the audience which by
the way, had materially lessened
since Gov. Thome's effort by Hen
ley Bastin, who did the job nicely.
Mr. Swope made a speech along the
same lines. of the one delivered here
a few weeks ago and was given a
very respectful hearing. Democrats
say that Garrard county is in good
shape and, that her majority will be
on the right side of the big book in
November.
MRS. JOHN S. HUGHES DEAD.
Her many friends here, among
whom she lived the greater portion
of her life, learned with deep regret
of the death of Mrs. John S. Hughes
of West Point, this state. Her de
mise followed a protracted illness in
the Good Samaritan Hospital at Lex
ington Friday. Deceased was Miss
Emma Johnson, of this county, and
she is survived by her husband, so
well known here, and a, sister, Mrs.
F. J, Campbell, of Lexington. She
was 70 years old and was a most ex
cellent, christian woman. She moved
with her husband from Stanford
some 15 years ago and most of the
time since had been spent at West
Point. Her burial occurred in Cave
Hill Cemetery, Louisville, Sunday,
after services by H. L. Calhoun.

enthusiasts attended the sale held by
Mrs. J. S. Owsley here last week. It

ings. Among the out-of-town ladies
here for the sale were Mesdames Lo

BASTIN BROS. BUY FRANCHISE.
News from Lancaster is to the ef
fect that the Bastin Bros., of that
city bought the electric light fran
chise offered by the city of Lancas
ter Saturday. They are said to have
agreed to furnish light to the city
of Lancaster at $12.50 for each 100
candle power light. A new plant
will be installed and a 24-hour ser
vice furnished the patrons, some
thing badly needed in every town.
The Messrs. Bastin are among the
livest young business men in this
part of Kentucky, and with them at
the head of the electric light plant,
it is bound to be a big success.
BOUGHT HIGHLAND FARM.
Daley Hutchison, who moved from
Texas to Covington some months ago
came over last week and bought the
John Baugh place, near his old home
at Highland. The place contains 70
acres and Mr. Hutchison paid $2,000
for it, a team of horses and most of
the crops.
How to Give Good Advise.
The best way to give good advice
is to set a good example. When oth
ers see how quickly you get over
your cold by taking Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy they are likely to fol

been in use for many years and en
joys an excellent reputation. Ob
tainable everywhere.

Nolan Buys Out Carter
Former Eubanks Young Man Gets
Business In Danville.
Edward Nolan, formerly of Eu
bank, early this week purchased the
grocery, dry goods and general mer
chandise store of John J. Carter,
near the depot in Danville, and has
assumed charge. Mr. Nolan has
been making his home in Danville
for some time, and has many friends
there who predict he will enjoy a
very lucrative business. The loca.
tion is a splendid one and Mr. Carter
has done well there. Station A of the
Danville postoffice has been located
in the Carter store, and Mr. Nolan
will also take over the postmaster-
ship of that department of the Dan
ville office. Mr. Carter probably will
return to his farm in the Hall's Gap
section, which will be good news to
his many friends back in Lincoln
county, which he left a few years
ago when he bought the store in
Danville.
MULE BUYERS BUSY
M. B. Eubanks, who, with his part
ner R. L. Hubble, is feeding about

ty farm, was over here Monday and
purchased from Green Gooch, of the
Wavnesburg section, halt a dozen
head of mare mules for which he paid
$965. Thev ran in years from four
to six. Mr. Eubanks bought five
head at Somerset last week, which
cost him around the same figure.
Mule buyers were very busy at Som
erset the past few weeks. A total
of five car loads are said to have
been shipped out of the Pulaski cap
ital during the fair there, many of
them being bought in the lower
counties and brought into Somerset
for delivery and shipment.
