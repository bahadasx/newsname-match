SUPERVISOR OF
MAUI TESTIFIES
AT 1.-1. HEARING
R. A.-lrUmmOnd OT Hana rlieS
No Complaint- Against
Company's Rates
Ramos Augustin Drummond, mem
ber for six years of the board of su
pervisors of . Maul county, and a cat
tle shipper of Hana and Nlu," testified
this afternoon before the public utili
ties commission in its continuation
of the Inter-Island Steam Navigation
hearing. '
Drummond voiced no complaint
against the new rates of the steam
ship company which have beed the
subject of other witnesses in previ
ous meetings, nor has he ever filed a
formal complaint with the company's
office. His chief complaint today was
over the manner In which the com
pany's men handle the cattle in load
ing, v ..
"It Isn't- for . me to send men on
board the Claujine to see that cattle
are bundled as they should be," he
said, "but I always- have to do it for
the sailors think it a good joke if a
steer sets loose and swims back to
shore. Not long ago I had one break
his leg when he reached the rocks, a
loss of about $23. There are always a
lot of greenhorns among the sailors
and thy aren't careful about holding
the ropes. That's the reason I put on
a man of my own.
Drummond snys it would be diffi
cult to fix the blame on anyone for
bruised cattle. They may be bruised
In the sling when being lifted aboard
or they may be jammed in the cor
ral before loading. Bruised meat is
always cut down in price. He has
made verbal complaints to the purser
in regard to cattle loading, but in gen
eral he is satistled. Once, he said, an
800-pound cow fell from the sling
when high in the air, hitting a sailor
and breaking Ms collar bone. The
cow eventually got on to the range,
while the sailer went to Hana for
treatment
: The shipper will not be affected one
way or another by the change in
rates. He formerly paid $4 a head for
larger cattle, now he will pay one cent
a pound dressod weight which will
amount to about the same price. . He
would not commit himself as to wheth
er the rate is just or unjust If it were
cheaper it wotld be better for him,
he said. He has never had any diffi
culty in securing the Claudine when
he w ishes to ship "cattle, which aver
ages about once a mcnth. r - . '
