MILITARY TRAINING FOR '
HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
Through tho kindness of Col. 'W.
H. Strossman, who has had consid
erable experience in military af
fairs, a plnn has been set on foot,
having in view the training of the
boys of the High School and upper
grades in elementary military tac
tics. It is not the intention of the
school authorities to emphasize tho
military side of the training so
much a3 tho development of the
boys physically, and to that end
there will be "setting up'1 exercises,
or in common parlance, physical
culture classes, organized at once
and after some degree of proficien-,
cy shall hnvo been reached, regu
lar drill will be held, tho equipment
for samo to be furnished by the
War Department.
While at Plattsburg, Col. Stross
mnn had a conference with General
Wood, of tho War Department) who"
encouraged the idea of giving the
boj'3 of high school ago tho bene
fits of physical culture. He empha
sized the fact that a boy not only
could never become a good soldier,
but thnt ho could not become a
good citizen unless ho is "physical
ly fit" that strong men arc needed
in time of peace as well as in time
of war and that tho only way that
class of citizenship can bo obtain
ed is to train tho boys of high
school ago whilo they are still sus
ceptible of the highest develop
ment. Tho students are very grateful
to Col. Strossman for his willing
ness to snerifico his time for tho
benefit of tho boys nnd trust that
such good results can bo obtained
that he will feel fully repaid for his
services. nigh School News.

ASLEEP IN
HER LORD
i
"Gran" Jordan, One of the Oldest
and Best Beloved Women In
the City, Dead.
Mrs. Lula Jordan, better known
to nearly every one in our city nnd
county ns "Gran," died nt the
home of her grand-dnughtcr, Mm
Luln Barnes, on Main street, this
morning nt 12:20 o'clock. For
many months she had been an in
valid and her death while not n
surprise, causes universal sorrow
and regret. She was n wonderful
old lady and had she lived until
next Monday would have been 0G
years of nge. Alwnys of a bright
and sunny disposition, looking on
'he happy side of life, she ever had
a word of kindness nnd cheer for
nil with whom she came in contact
Not for her our tears, rather let us
crown her grave with garland.
Few of us will live ns long or ns
well, nnd fewer yet will the Angel
of Death greet with such loving
touch. It must be so these tender
human ties must be broken, yet in
death there is no cnuso for grief,
her life work was done nnd done
well; so wearied with suffering and
waiting she has lain down to rest
For many, many years she was a
member of tho Christian church
and was always happiest when
rendering some service in the caue
of her Lord nnd Master. Funeral
services will bo conducted nt the
Christian church Wednesday after
noon nt 2:30 o'clock by Rev. B. W.
Triinble, assisted by Rev. . Clyde
-Darsie, -with -burinl-in Machpelah
cemetery.
