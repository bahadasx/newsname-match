Charges Republicans With
Spending Money to Buy
Governorship.
POINTS OUT LEADERS
Shows Opponent Backed by
Interests Labor Planks
Hold Attention.
Springfield. 111., Sept. 26 The demo
cratic prate convention reconvened
here today at 1:15 o'clock after unit
ing more than an hour for the resolu
tions committee to complete its work
on the platform. The convention was
called to order hy Attorney General
Lucey, who invited all candidates for
state offices to the platform. One thou
sand delegates and visitors were pres
ent. Attorney General Lucey in opening
the convention said the democratic
party had nominated a candidate for
president with greater good feeling
than has existed since the days of
President Monroe, who was nominated
by both parties.
Governor Dunne was the last state
officer to enter the hall. He was given
a rousing ovation as the band played
"Illinois."
Chairman Lucey introduced the dem
ocratic candidates for state offices and
each address the convention.
Governor Dunne in part said:
"Can money buy the governorship
of Illinois?" asked the governor, de
claring this to he the most important
issue before the people. "Our oppon
ents are spending little time in analyz
ing the achievements of the democrat
ic administration but they are spend
ing enormous Eums of money in an
effort to win the election."
Pointing out that one of the duties
which will devolve upon Colonel
Frank O. Lowden if he is elected gov
ernor will be the appointment of the
Illinois public utilities commission.
Governor Dunne said that Lowden
would be guided by the advice of his
associates who he said, are "men who
derive their incomes from such pub
lic utilities."
'"Who are these associates?" he
asked. "Among them is J. Ogden Ar
mour. Mr. Armour is chairman of the
Lowden Business Men's committee.
Incidentally he is head of the ware
house combination in the state of Illi
nois and the head of the packing in
dustries of the United States. The
Lowden business men's committee also
includes railroad officials and stock
holders in the railroad companies and
gas and electric light companies.
"William McKinley, who is head of
the McKinley interurban lines, is the
fame gentleman who called the re
publican convention to order in Peoria
a few days ago.
"I would say that Colonel Lowden is
as intimately acquainted with the rail
road, traction, gas and electric light
magnates as any man in the state."
Quotes Hull Speech.
Governor Dunne then quoted the
words of Senator Morton D. Hull, de
feated candidate for the republican
nomination for governor,' who in a
speech at Taylorville, July 27. said:
"Do you want the public utilities of
Illinois to appoint the public utilities
commission ?"
After reviewing the record of the
public utilities commission, which he
said was a record "of which Illinois
should feel proud," he continued:
"Shall this record be maintained or
shall a different character of commis
sion be created, the record of which
cannot be foretold? Will the cor
porations control the state public
utilities commission or will the state
public utilities commission control the
corporations?"
This he t-aid was the most vital Is
sue ever presented to the voters of
Illinois.
Reviews Administration Record.
The governor reviewed the acts and
legislation of his own and the national
administration. He declared the is
sues presented in the national ad
ministration. He declared the issues
presented in the national platforms of
toth the democratic and republican
parties, can be condensed into a
eimple statement. It is this, he said:
"Whether the administration given
by the democratic party shall be en
dorsed by the American people or
not?"
He accused th republicans of as
sailing the policies which he said have
thus far have not only "preserved
Peace between the republic and all
other nations but have preserved in
dustrial peace within the United
States."

DRY CANDIDATE
TALKING IN WEST
Pr. Ira Landrith Brands Argument of
"Wets" Regarding Prohibition as
Only "Silly."
Raton, X. M., Sept. 26. The argu
ment that more liquor is sold in "dry"
states than in "wet" was declared
"silly" today by Dr. Ira Landrith, pro
hibition candidate for vice president at
the last meeting of the "dry" special
train campaigners in New Mexico.
"Do you think for a minute that if
the assertion were true the liquor in
terests would be fighting prohibition?"
he asked. "Wouldn't it he good busi
ness for them to make every endeavor
to increase in 'dry territory If their
sales increased proportionately? They
would be contributing to the expenses
of this special train if liquor consump
tion would be increased by our work
and I give you my word they have not
given us a cent."
From here the special train left for
Colorado. Meetings were to be held
today at Trinidad, La Junta, Rocky

LendsEar to
Strike Case
New York, Sept. 26 Governor Whit
man has promised to meet here this
afternoon a committee representing
members of the state legislature from
Manhattan and the Bronx to hear their
request for a special session of the leg
islature to "deal with the situation"
resulting from the threat of a general

OFFERS PLAN TO
PREVENT STRIKES
Jndson C. Clements Recommends His
Method in Address at Conven
tion of Grain Dealers.
Baltimore, Md., Sept. 26. What he
held to be a feasible and equitable
method of preventing strikes on rail
roads or other public service corpo
rations was recommended by Judson
... Clements of the interstate commerce
commission, in an address before the
annual meeting of the Grain Dealers
National association here today. Judge
Clements, who said he was expressing
his personal views and not speaking
officially, suggested writing Into the
law a "legally established obligation
and duty upon every employe who
seeks and accepts service with the
transportation companies, not to leave
the service or combine with others to
do so, on account of any controversyy
thereafter " arising concerning and
change in the conditions of service or
rates of compensation except upon due
and reasonable notice to be prescribed
by statute, permitting a sufficient
length of time for a fair and impartial
investigation and determination of the
matter in controversy, either by arbi
tration or by some duty constituted
public tribunal."
Judge Clements declared that those
who were engaged as employes in the
public service of the transportation
companies are just as much engaged
in interstate commerce as are the com
panies themselves, "and that such em
Ployes are affected in respect thereof,
i in the same way and to the same ex-
tent as are the companies themselves,
with a public Interest which they can
no more ignore than can the transpor
tation companies."

STATE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
Springfield, III, Sept. 26 After
reviewing the achievements of the
state and national administrations
the platform adopted by the demo
eratic state contention here today
deals with what it calls the in
visible government," in connection
with which the name of Frank O.
I.owden, republican candidate for
governor is mentioned.
The plank on "invisible government"
follows:
"We view with grave apprehension
the efforts of the large corporate in
terests to govern the affairs of the
people of Illinois at the state rapitol.
As evidence of this we would point to
the enormous expenditure of money in
behalf of Colonel Lowden, the success
ful republican candidate in the late
primary campaign. A sum prodigal
bevond all reason and in violation of
the spirit and purpose of the primary
law, which was designed to give the
people a free hand in choice of their
candidates. We ask from whence
conies this great fund, many times in
excess of the amount necessary to
place the candidates qualifications for
high office among the people?"
The party goes on record for "un
limited woman suffrage and the eight

The platform pledges the party the
initiative and referendum, the shorter
ballot and a larger measure of home
rule for municipalities and particu

has been another great day for the
Anglo-French forces on the Bomme.
As a spectacle it was the moBt splen

lied forces since the commencement of
the great offensive.
What either army was trying to do
and how they were doing it were com

Tonight the British have taken half
of Morval, all of Lesbeoufs and have
advanced their line on a front of 8,000

Earth Shaken By Gunfire,
The correspondent of The Asso
ciated Press went forward yesterday
over the ridge in the Devil's Wood and
Ginchy region which the British had
iougm ior over two months to gain.
He walked for two miles through an
area which reverberated to the blasts
of the great guns. On the other side
of the ridge he saw guns where he had
never seen them before. The guns
were close up to the British Infantry.
On his return the correspondent
chose a gallery which took him past
many batteries which for two milea
were pouring out their Bhare of the
raging tempest of gunfire.
Infantry Rushes Forward.
Shortly after noon was the time
chosen for the infantry to rush for
ward under the cover of a final in
tensive chorus of shell from the artil
lery. The ridges in front and on eith
er hand were flecked with racing
sparks of flame. Within an hour at
least 60.000 shells must have been
fired within sight of the correspond
ent. Far to the south was Mont St.
Quentln, two miles from Peronne and
commanding the town. Directly in
front was Combles, which differed
from all the villages in sight in that
the walls of many of its buildings were
still standing. Also it formed an oasis
in the midst of the storm of battle.
Neither artillery nor Infantry paid any
attention to it. The gauge of battle
was the high ground around it, the
possession of which means the com
mand of the town. Farther north lay
the ruins of Ginchy and Guillemont.
Face German Cannon.
At the appointed time the waves of
infantry surged forward to the attack.
Then the tremendous fire of the Ger
man guns swelled to its utmost volume
until the whole field was lost in vast
clouds of smoke. The attacking infan
try vanished In that grim pall while
high overhead scores of sausage bal
loons and hundreds of aeroplanes,
their wings gleaming like silver in the
brilliant sunlight, strove vainly to see
what was passing beneath them. Then
across the dead fields arose a signal
