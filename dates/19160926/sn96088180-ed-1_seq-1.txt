BRITISH CAPTURE CITYOF
GOflrlBLES FROM GERMANS
Fall of Keypoint of the Teuton Battle line From Bapaume
to ferae is Most Notable Achievement of the Cam
paign Along the Somme, Where lor Three Weeks the
Fight Has Raged With Unahating Intensity
London, Sept. 26. Combles, key-
point of the whole German battle line
from .Baipaume to Peronne, has been
captured by the British, after 18
hours of most furious battling north
of the Somme.
.General Halg this afternoon an
nounced that British troops entered
Combles, overcoming German resis
tance. The enemy's losses, the offi
cial report said, were severe.
The (British victory, achieved after
three weeks of desperate driving
against the German center, is the
most striking single achievement of
the Somme offensive. It removes one
of the last two obstacles to an Anglo
French thrust to squeeie the Ger
mans out of Peronne, one of the two
objectives of the great allied advance.
The capture of Combles followed a
day and night of most brilliant allied
successes, Including the capture of
the villages of Morval and Les Bouefs
by the British, and Rancourt and
Freglcourt by the French.
In summing up the day's success
ful operations, General Halg report
ed 1.500 Germans were captured by
the British and that more prisoners
are being brought In. The work of
listing large supplies of war mate
rials, also captured, has not been
completed.
Fighting was still going on In
some places In the streets of Combles
when General Halg's report was filed.
Comblea fell after thrusts by both
British and French In yesterday's
fighting drew a noose about the Ger
man garrison, which made their e-
cape Almost Impossible. For weeks
the Germans had used the town, with
Its wonderful system of fortifications,
as a pivot point from which to swing
attacks, north and south, at the al
lies' lines. In the last month of
fighting the British and French lines
pressed steadily forward on both
sides, until the town was In a deep
pocket. It was no longer available

loss of villages to the allied forces
under one of the most terrific attacks
of the whole Somme offensive was
officially admitted this afternoon.
"The allied Infantry, after a four-
day artillery duel, launched a uniform
attack between the Ancre and the
Somme," the war office atated. "The
Agisting commenced at noon and went
on last night with the same fury.
"between the Ancre and Eaucourt
L'Abbaye the hostile thrust was
stifled by our lire and broke down
with bloody losses before our lines.
The successes obtained by the enemy
east of Eaucourt L'Abbaye and the
conquest of villages on the line of
Geudecourt-Bouchavesnes must be
recognised, but before all we must
think of our heroic troops who face
the united Anglo-French principal
forces and massed employment of the
whole world's war Industries, pre
pared for many months. Near Bou
rns vesnes and further south to the
Somme repeated French charges fail
ed under the heaviest losses."

the allies have conquered villages on
the line of Guedecourt-Bouchavesnes
is seemingly admission that Combles
has been captured by the allies. The
