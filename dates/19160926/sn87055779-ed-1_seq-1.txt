Ir.tericitlonnl News Service:
WASHINGTON, ipt. 26. Crea
tion of a national hoard of media
tion and conciliation, with broadest
possible powers, but just short of the
iipht to enforce compulsory arbitra
tion may be the outcene of Pres't
Wilson inviting supKcstions of the
Pest -a-ay to reconcile capital and
lahorj
The president's appeal for sug
gestions is likely to meet with a
ready response. Iabor leaders here
and the few senators and represent
atives still in Washington are study
ing the situation very carefully.
They agree with the statement of tho
president that the "greatest menace
apparent" to the continued prosper
ity of the country is the increasing
unrest in the labor world.
Organized labor leaders, however,
are chary of endorsing any plan that
niieht tie their hands in enforcing
their demands through a strike. All
who would talk at all insisted todr.y
that the strike is labor a greatest
weapon, and that they are oppesed
to any action that would in any way
abridge it. Most of them believe
that a federal mediation board
board would be a tirst step toward
compulsory arbitration.
Nome Method Needed.
It is known, h.wever, that Pres't
Wilson and his tdvisers are con
vinced that some method of media
tion must he decided on by congress
in the immediate future. Just how
it is to be brought about will have
to be worked out through a modifi
cation of all plans that up to the
present time have been suggested.
It is known that the president had
hoped that the former federal com
mission on industrial relations would
have found the way out. but congress
ilatly .ignored its recommendations,
saying they were "too radical." How
ever, much of the data compiled
now is available for a new federal
body if one is named. The presi
dent, it is expected, will dwell at
length on this subject in his mes
sage to congress when it reconvenes
next December.
Prom the labor leoders now in
Washington the following expres
sions on the subject .verc obtained
today:
Samuel Rompers, president of th
American Federation of Labor:
"Pres't Wilson's plan to evolve a
general solution th it w ill effectually
prevent great labor disputes in the
future will ,of course, have the co
operation of organized labor. Iibor
leaders will take advantage of his
invitation to submit suggestions to
this end. This is : problem which
talis for deep study and at this
time I am unable to outline my
view on this question. I shrill give
the matter careful attention, how
ever, and shall comply with the
president's request where possible.
The president's idea is worthy of
commendation and cooperation."
James OVonnell. president of the
Metal Trades' department. American
Federation of Labor, and former
member of the federal commission
in industrial relations:
'Vertainly in this enlightened age
we should be able to fulfill Pres't
Wilun's plan to develop a general
scheme vhich will eliminate future
clashes letwveti labor and capital.
It is a big problem, but we should
be able to work out a real solution.
I am oppesed to any plan which
contemplates compelling the work
ing nun to submit his claims or
grievances to any tribunal. Hut I
lelieve that the situation can be met
by organization. If we can reach a
point where well organized laboring
men. Landed together for their own
advancement, can sit down with rep
resentatives of their employers on
terms nf equality, . I feel confident
that every possible difference be
tween tho two sides can be satis
factorily adjusted. I do not believe
mu h can be done by legal enact
ment." ciiiiw is svi:d.

Zeppelins Raid .
British Coast

lDtrrnatlon.il Nervs Service:
LONDON, Sept. 26. Undaunted
by the loss of two Zeppelins 4 S
hours earlier, the Hermans made an
other raid over Fngiand last night
and early today, killing 2'J persons.
(Jen. French, commander-in-chief
of the home forces, reported the
casualty list today.
A number of houses were wreck
ed, but the aerial invaders were un
able to get near industrial centers
because of the high-angle tire and
the attacks of British airmen.
Seven Zeppelins took part in the
raid, according to an ollicial .an
nouncement and two separate areas
were attacked, one in the north
eastern counties and the other in
the southern counties.
Many bombs were dropped, but
Zeppelins have begun to lose their
power to terrify since three have
been shot down.
SPECIAL SPSS!
Governor Lets It be Known
That He Does Not Believe
Action is Needed.
International News Service:
NEW YORK. Sept. 26. Gov.
Whitman let it be known shortly
before noon today that he would
not call a special session of the
New York legislature to deal with
the threatened general strike here,
called for tomorrow morning. He
stated that he would receive the
committee of legislators this after
noon, but made it clear by his at
titude that he did not believe thy
present situation called for such
drastic action.
A legislative committee of nine
will meet the governor this after
noon and urge him to take this step
at once. Indications were that the
strike leaders would not oppose
such action. General reluctance has
been shown among the labor organ
izations regarding the call for a gen
eral strike to aid the carmen's
"cause." In some quarters the be
lief prevails that merely the calling
of the legislature would have im
portant effects on the labor men.
Itenewed outbreaks of violence
marked the traction strike early to
day. Jtevolver shots were fired at a
Third av. elevated train and numer
out other trains were bombarded
from roofs with showers of missiles.
No one was injured, however. Two
arrests were made.

Lansing today flatly contradicted
the official reiort of Gn. George l-
Hell. jr.. that Villa was present at
the raid of Chihuahua City Sept.
16. that Carranza soldiers deserted
to him and that great iiiantities of

Sec'y Iansing announced
"Confidential advices f rom Chi

statement of Mr. Arredondo (Mex

Villa was not present in the recent
raid on Chihuahua City, that the
raiders took away no arms nor am

desertions from the Carranzista
forces."
Ambassador-Designate Arredondo
later made public an official report
"containing all the facts" about the

IH)STIM)i: ritOTI-XTOUATTl.
International News Service:
Ni:V LONDON, Conn., Sept. 26.
Satisfied of the inability of the
Mexican commission to induce
American bankers to float a loan of
$100.000.000. or more, the American
commissioners are prepared to sub
mit a proposal for the establishment
of a practical financial protector
torate over Mexico. This was learn
ed on high authority today.
The plan is this: To guarantee
the payment of the interest and
principle on a Mexican loan.
To establish an American com
mission to supervise the expenditures
of the rehabilitation of Mexico.
To establish, as a collateral issue,
a constabulary under the partial
control of this commission, for pa
trolling the northern section of
Mexico and for the protection of
the border. This border patrol
under the present plan, would be
otlicered for the most p.rt by Airier
iean military men and made up of
Mexicans tiualied for the positions.
Pending the arrival of a reply
from (irn. Carranza to the question
put up to him yesterday by th
Mexican representative. asking
whether the "first chief" insists that
the withdrawal of American troops
be disposed of before other ques
tions are considered bv the Mex
ican representatives, both commis
sions are practically at a standstill.
The meetings here will adjourn
Thursday, to meet Monday nl At
