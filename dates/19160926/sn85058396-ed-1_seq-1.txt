I French and British Advance Over I I
) Six Miles Along the Somme Front I
Allied Troops Enter Combles
-Many Prisoners and Much
L War Material Captured;
r Rumanians Forging Ahead
British and French troops today
reached the town of Combles on the
Somme front, after having virtually
pocketed the place in a struggle of
j. many -weeks' duration, and are fight-
; Ing to gain complete possession of it.
I Attacking from the north, British
troops have forced their way into the
place, London reports, and are over
coming the German resistance there.
On the south the French have
reached the town's edge and have pen
etrated the cemetery. In addition,
they have further closed the small
opening left in the Combles pocket by
capturing all of the village of Fregi
court, a mile to the east.
The Combles salient has long been
a serious hindrance to the allies, ham
pering them in their offensive toward
Bapaume and Peronne.
Bombs dropped in last night's Zep
pelin air raid on England carried out
by some half dozen of these German
aircraft, caused the death of 29 per-
, sons, it was officially announced in
' London today.
While the battle on the Somme front
was at its height, the Germans last
night attacked the French lines at
Verdun, driving in between the Thiau
mont work and Fleury, east of the
Meuse. Paris announces that the
French guns were effective in check
ing the German assaults.
Berlin today admits an entente ad
vance on the Somme front along the
Hen for Guedecourt to Bouchavesnes,
a distance of G 1-2 iriiles. This line
Includes the Combles sector.
On the eastern front in the Car
pathians Berlin concedes the suc
cesses of the Rumanians in forcing
their way again into the Szurduk and
Vulcan passes.
Rumanians Occupy Heights.
Berlin, Sept 26, by wireless to Say
vMe. Rumanian troops have again
occupied the heights on the both sides
of Szurduk and Vulcan passes in
Transvlvania, says the official state
ment today. German troops repulsed
all the Rumanian attacks against the
i passes, the announcement adds, but
Trere withdrawn according to army or
ders. . .
Western front: "Anglo-French in
fantry vesterday, which was prepared
bv an artillery bombardment, launched
a uniform attack between the Ancre
brook and the river Somme.
"Fighting which commenced at noon
lasted during the night.
"At the Ancre and Eucourt LAb
bayee tho hostile thrust was stifled by
, our fire or broke down before our
lines. .
"Successes were obtained by tne
enemy east of Eucourt L'Abbayee and
the conquest of the villages on tho line
of Guidecourt-Bouchavesnes must be

BritiBh Front in France, Sept 25.
;, Via London, Sept 26, 6:58 a, m.
This has been another great day for
t 'he Anglo-French forces on tho Som
; As a spectacle for tho observer,
Jt was the most splendid of all the
i attacks made by tho allied forces
sjneo the commencement of the doing
; ,L the positions they held and sought

' ar'a grandeur If war can bo Bald to
oavc any grandeur.
Tonight the British have taken half
Morval, all of Lesboeuf and have
advanced their lino on a front of
i n2 yards for an average depth of
MM yards; the French have stormed
ancourt and have pushed their lino
, J the outsklrt of the little village

Correspondent on Battlefield.
The correspondent of the Associate'1
Press went forward yesterday over
the ridge In the Devil's wood and
GInchy region, which tho British had
fought for over two months to gain.
He walked for two miles through an
area which reverberated to the blast?
of the great guns, picking his way br
tween the bursts of flame from th
crashing batteries and moving aroun
the rows of cannon as one who seek'
a ford in a stream. On tho other
side of the ridge he saw guns where
he never had seen before on the
promised land of the lower levels
which the British had won by persis
tent siege work. The guns wero close
up to the British Infantry who lis
tened to their thunderous chorus as
they prepared for the charge in to
day's attack. "The usual artillery
preparation," said an artillery offi
cer. On his return the correspondent de
cided that he would not pass through
that wilderness of British guns of all
sizes and caliber while he had any
hearing left Every one of them was
firing at top speed. He chose a gal
lery which took him past many bat
teries which for two miles were
nourlng out their share of the raging
tempest of gunfire. From the ruins
of some old German trenches, whence
tho battlo panorama stretched before
him, the correspondent had a near
view of the French gunners who were
feeding shells into the gun breeches
as grain Is fed into a threshing ma
chine and with the mechanical pre
cision of automatics.
Chorus of Hell.
Shortly after noon was tho time
chosen for the infantry to rush for
ward under the cover of a final in
tensive chorus of hell from the artil
lery. Tho ridges in front and on
either hand were flecked with raising
sparks of flame. Within an hour, at
lease, imy mousano. sneiis must nave
been fired within sight of the corre
spondent. Far to the south was Mont
St. Quentin, two miles from Peronne,
and commanding that town which the
allied commanders say, will fall like
a ripe plum when the time comes.
The hill lay hazy above tho green
fliogo of the river valley in the midst
of vast bursts of black smoke from
shells of enormous caliber. Directly
in front was Combles, another town
which has come to mean much to the
imagination of the public in England
and France, who seem to regard its
capture of vital significance. Com
bles differed from all the villages in
sight, in that the walls of many of its
buildings were still standing. It was
different, too, in the fact that it
formed an oasis In the midst of the
storm of battle. Neither artillery nor
infantry paid any attention to It
The gauge of battle was the high
ground around it, the possession of
which means the command of the
town. Farther north lay tho ruins of
GInchy and Gulllemont
Infantry Surges Forward.
At the appointed timo, tho waves
of Infantry surged forward to the
attack. Then the tremendous thunder
of tho German guns swelled to their
utmost volume until tho whole field
was lost in vast clouds of smoke.
The attacking infantry vanished in
that grim pall, while high overhead
scores of sausage balloons and hun
dreds of aeroplanes, their wings
gleaming liko silver In the brilliant
sunlight, strove vainly to see what
was passing beneath them.
Then, across the dead fields arose
a signal from Morval which told that
the British infantry had reached an
other goal and that another village
was taken. A man at a telephone In
a nearby signal station called out the
capture of the different strong points
with the enthusiasm of one who scores
a hotly contested game.
British Wounded Brought.
Presently the British wounded be
gan to straggle back and their bear
ingas they moved along beside their
prisoners, was another criterion by
which tho correspondent knew how
tho day had gono without making
inquiries of the staff. The German
machine guns had stopped them for a
while at some points, but generally,
reports told of every position being
taken on the minute set in the pro
gram. .The British wounded said that
of course they got there as they were
used to getting there.
Fighting In the Open.
Their great gratification was that
It was becoming an even fight since
the Germans had no more prepared
lines but both armies wore fighting in
the opem According to the British
officers, the Germans on the fighting
front have no longer any trenches
oxcept those which are dug under
fire.

fflKlLES
Resistance of Germans Being
Overcome and Strongly
Fortified Position Lost.
COSTLY ALLIED EFFORT
Combined Effort of French
and British Renders Enemy
Position Untenable.
London, Sept 26, 2 p. m The Brit
ish have entered Combles on the Som
me front, the war office announced
today, and are overcoming tho resist
ance of the Germans.
Combles, a town of some 2000 pop
ulation before the war, had been ren
dered of small strategic importance
to the allies by their long continued
encircling movement. It has been of
notable value to the Germans, how
ever, becauso as long as they clung
to it the Franco-British freedom of
action in pushing their offensive
movements toward Bapaume and Pe
ronne on either side of it was ham
pered. Turned into a strongly forti
fied position by German defensive in
genuity, it . has persistently held fast
like a rock in the course of a turbu
lent stream that has had to be blasted
loose before the channel was fully
opened up.
Allied Effort Costlv.
This process has only been accom
plished by long continued, severe and
costly effort on the part of the al
lies. Driving in from the south, the
French successively swept by Hardi
court, Maurepas, Leforest and finally
reached Fregicourt, a mile west of
Combles. More slowly but none the
less surely the British have pushed
their advance on the north of the Ger
man salient. Their struggles to reach
and hold GInchy and Gulllemont were
expensive in time and men, but final
ly tho ground north of Combles and
some distance to the east was occu
pied, putting the town in a pocket of
which the opening was constantly be
ing narrowed by the drives of tho en
tente armies.
.Combined Attack Made.
Yesterday came the combined ef
fort of the French and British to close
the opening or at least render it so
narrow that what could be extracted
through It by the Germans would not
be worth while. Only two roads re
mained over which the Germans could
withdraw their men and guns. The
single track railroad running through
tho place had long since been ren
dered useless.
Attacking from the north, General
Halg's forces pushed to, and occupied
Morval, cutting the northerly road
running to Le Transloy.
Striking from the south the French
pushed their line to Fregicourt, sever
ing towards Sailly. The gap between
Morval and Fregicourt a mile and a
half in width and reaching hack to
ward Combles, was swept from either
direction by the combined fire of
French and British guns.
It is not thought probable that any
considerable force of Germans remain
ed in Combles. During the day yes
terday when It was becoming evident
that the allied forces were achieving
their object of closing in eaBt of the
town, tho Germans are reported to
have begun withdrawing guns from It.
More than 1,500 prisoners, taken
In the fighting of the last 24 hours,
havo already been counted, and n
largo amount of wnr material has been
capturocL The announcement fol
lows: "Yesterday's operations wero entire
ly successful. Tho preparation of
an execution of the attack by tho In
fantry by tho infantry and the co-operation
betwen them wero in all re
spects admirable.
"More than 1,500 prisoners already
havo passed through the collecting
stations and more are arriving. Much
war material has been captured, but
tho amount cannot yot be estimated.
"Further progress has been mado
during tho night and this morning.
"A strong redoubt which had held
out betwen Les Boehufs and Guede
court has ben complete! and the garri
son made prisoners.
"Our troops entered Combles from
the west and are overcoming the one
my's resistanco. There tho enemy's
losses wero very severe."
Anglo-French Successes.
Berlin, Sept 2G, by wireless to Say
ville. Successes were achieved by the
Anglo-French forces on the Somme
last night to tho east of Eaucourt
L'Abbayee, north of Flours, says the
official statement Issued by the Ger
man army headquarters today. Tho
conquest of the villages on tho line
of Guedecourt-Bouchavesnes, tho
statement adds, must bo recognized.
French Enter Combles.
Paris, Sept. 26, 12:15 p. m. Con
tinuing their offensive north of the
Somme, the French last night cap
tured all of the village of Fregicourt
and penetrated tho Combles cemetery.
, A French reconnoitering party
reached the southern border of Com
bles, says today's official announce
ment. Eight hundred unwounded pris
oners were taken in the fighting of
yesterday on the Somme front.
Violent counter attacks were made
by the Germans last night on the Ver
dun front between Thiaumont work
and Fleury. These assaults were
checked by the French artillery and
rifle fire.

Kruttschnltt Reviews Year.
In his review of the year's opera
tions, Chairman Julius Kruttschnltt
says:
"The interruption of steamship ser
vice through the Panama canal since
September 18, I9lf., has minimized
sea competition and has restored to
your company's lines the freight
which had 'been diverted from them
by the frequent steamship service
through the Panama canal during tho
previous year and by the low rates
then prevailing Nearly all the steam
ers which had operated through the
canal found more profitable employ
ment In consequence of the increased
demand for steamship tonnage owing
to tho European wnr and they havo
not boon restored to regular service
between Atlantic and Pacific ports
since the re-opening of the canal.
"Uopn the return of normal condi
tions, however, It may safely be as
sumed that the intense competition of
the steamship imes wm bo encoun
tered again."

Trinidad, Colo.. Sept 26. President
Wilson and Charles E. Hughes again
became the target of the Prohibition
campaigners today when the first Col
orado meeting was held hero from the
rear of the special coast-to-coast train.
The crowd was large because Colorado
is dry.
"I read In the papers today," Ira
Landrith, the Prohibition vice-presidential
candidate said, "that Mr. Wil
son, in a speech at Baltimore yester
day, said that the only thing he ever
had been ashamed of in America was
in its timidity in the face of forolgn
competition.
"Thousands of persons today are
ashamed that the government is in
partnership with the liquor traffic,
and I am ashamed that tho govern
ment has free, easy partnership with
a business which destroys 100,000 per
sons every year, that sends 50,000
own politicians and newspapers and
that we are afraid to destroy because
we need the money.
"So this morning I could not vote
for a man who says ho is only
ashamed of the fact that we are -too
timid to compete for foreign com
merce. "And while I am saying that, I
might say the same thing for Hughes,
for, as far as I can see, he is ashamed
of nothing. He has just completed a
trip across the country and all that he
has accomplished is the crossing. We
now sing, as wo used to about the old
cow: 'Mr. Hughes has crossed the
road because he crossed the road.' "
