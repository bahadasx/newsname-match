county is suing for partial recovery
on allegations of irregular expendi
tures of more than $200,000 of its
funds as contained in a recent report
of the state public examiner which
resulted in suspensions of the audi
tor and five county commissioners by
the governor pending investigations,
according to N. B. Arnold, a Duluth
attorney, representing the county in
the new civil actions.
Mr Arnold arrived in St. Paul to
consult Governor Burnquist on the
proposed suspension of the remaining
board of Koochiching county commis
sioners on charges of malfeasance

plained ,are the basis of the civil ac

covery by Koochiching county
against former County Auditor J. H.
Slocum, former Commissioner S.
McDonald, George A Elder and A.

recites that prior to January 1, 1916,
Koochiching county authorized the
issuance of $765,000 of 5% per cent
county bonds in connection with pro
jects for eight judicial ditches. It
alleges that the defendants "con
spired together to defraud Koochi
ching county out of its money and
property, and as a part of such agree-
ment," and further that Slocum and
McDonald were to use their influence
to bring about the issues and sale of
the bonds to the advantage of the de
fendants. STATE HAS RECEIVED
