Fearing to Escape Thru Gap,
3,000 Surrender at Combles.
London, Sept. 26. Combles, key
point of the whole German battle line
from Baupaume to Peronne, has been
captured by the British after eighteen
hours of most furious battling north
of the Somme.
General Haig this afternoon an
nounced that British troops entered
Combles, overcoming German resist
ance. The enemy's losses, the official
report said, were severe.
The British victory, achieved after
three weeks of desperate driving
against the German center, is the most
striking single achievement of the
whole Somme offensive.
It removes one of the last two ob-
stacles to an Anglo-French thrust to i
squeeze the Germans out of Peronne, !
one of the two objectives of the great 1
allied advance. The capture of Com
bles followed a day and night of most
brilliant allied successes, including the
capture of Morval and Les Boeufs by
the British, and Rancourt and Fregi
court by the French. In summing up
the day's successful operations. Gen
eral Haig reported 3,000 Germans
were captured by the British and that
more prisoners are being brought in.
Combles, Germans Pivot.
The work of listing large supplies of
war materials also captured has not
been completed.
Combles fell after thrusts by both
British and French in yesterday's
fighting drew a noose about the Ger
man garrison which made their escape
almost impossible. For weeks the
Germans had used the town with its
wonderful system of fortifications as
a pivot point from which to swing
attacks', north and south at the allied
lines. In the last month of fighting
the British and French lines pressed
steadily forward on . both sides until
the town was in a deep pocket. It was
no longer available for the Germans
as a pivotal point but it still held out,
buttressing the German line and
blocking a further allied advance. The
British not only gained this important
victory but pressed forward in their
drive toward Baupaume last night and
early today. A strong redoubt be
tween Les Bouefs and Guerdecourt
fell before a British attjick. The
French also swept forward again last
night, carrying Fregicourt village and
later repulsing German attacks
against positions won yesterday.

it is expected that a free discussion
will ensue today.

TROOPSJRE BEST
Kansas Soldiers Equal to Any
in Nation C. ! 3Iartin.
Adjutant General Returns
After Review in South.
Kansas troops as a whole are the
equal of any in the nation, while the
First regiment is the best in tne serv
ice of Uncle Sam on the Mexican bor
der. That was the enthusiastic verdict
today of Charles I. Martin, adjutant
general, when he returned to Topeka
after a review of troops in Austin and
San Antonio, Texas. Highest praise is
given the state troops by the adjutant
general.
In a discussion of the showing of
Kansas guardsmen. General Martin
stated that no troops in the country
were able to make a better snowing.
Only two regiments on the border are
on a par with the Kansas men, he said.
As for the First regiment, it is- the
peer of the government troops, was the
word of praise for the Kansans.
With Major General Funston, Gen
eral Martin reviewed the troops in
Austin, Texas. That showing gave
Kansas top of column standing in
army circles.
"The Kansas troops are as good as
the best in the service on the border,"
said General Martin. "The First regi
ment is the best in the service and
made a wonderful showing. 'What is
more the boys are standing the serv
ice unusually well. The men are in
excellent health and discipline is the
best."
General Martin stated that an ef
fort would be made to enlist new men
for the service. Recent efforts to se
cure new guardsmen have not pro
duced desired results.
"We need twenty to thirty men in
each company to make the showing
perfect," said the adjutant general.
"but .even on its present footing, the
Kansas troops are at the top. Re
newed efforts will be made at once to
enlist new men for the service."

Superintendent Wilson, who recent
ly returned from Chickasha and other
educational centers in the state, be
lieves his plan is meeting with uni
versal favor and commendation.
"Just one visit to the Oklahoma Col
lege for Women at Chickasha," said
he, "during chapel exercises any
morning would convince me that sim
plicity in drees is not only in line with
economr and thrift, but also essential
to the comfort and progress of the
students. When I visited this school
Wednesday morning I could not help
but be impressed with the spectacle
of 320 studious and industrious young
women dressed for their school work

Wreck Houses, but Plants
Aimed At Not Damaged.
London. Sept. 26. Twenty-nine
persons were killed in last night's
Zeppelin raid on England, the second
within, forty-eight hours, General
French, commander of the home
forces, reported today. A number of
small houses were wrecked or dam
aged but the raiders were successfully
driven away from industrial centers.
No damage was dene to factories or
military establishments.
Seven Zeppelins took part in the
raid. The south, east and northeast
counties and north midlands were at
tacked, principally industrial centers
in the latter region.
Use Smaller Dirigibles.
Anti-aircraft guns played upon the
raiders with considerable effective
ness, despite the fact that none was
brought down. The loss of the two
Zeppelins in Saturday night's raid did
not deter the Germans from risking
more airships in bombing attacks, but
some British aeronautic experts be
lieve smaller dirigibles, instead of the
large super-Zeppelins, which offer
splendid targets, will visit England on
future raids.

Washington, Sept. 2. The 100,000

Ford's plea in the libel suit against the

The league declare." statements in

To Act as Own T-awycr.
St. Joseph, Mo., Sept. 26. Refused
bail when arraigned charged with
murderirg his wife. County Prosecutor
Oscar McDaniel today planned to con
duct his own case at his preliminary f
hearing tomorrow. Altho the charge
of first degree murder is not bailable.
McDaniel plans to bring such an array
of influential friends into court ready
to go his bond hat even tho he is
refused release such a showing will
have a good effect on public senti
ment. When McDaniel was refused hall
he was transferred from' the city jail
to the county jail, isolated from the
other prisoners, and confined in the
hospital ward, because many of the
prisoners in the county jail had been
prosecuted by him.
Are Stains on Rod, Blood?
Until the stains on the metal rod
found in the McDaniel home have
been analyzed the state will place
little dependence on the alleged death
weapon. Special Prosecutor Lockwood
considers the case against McDaniel
complete without it. With only a little
more than a month remaining before
the election the special prosecutor
doubted today that a verdict could bs
reached before the prisoner goes be
fore the county for re-election as
county prosecutor. But Lockwood
promised to expedite the case.
McDaniel went to his arraignment
with the air of a man going to try
a case, rather than that of a man about
to face a murder charge. Between
puffs of a black cigar he laughed and
Joked with the two deputy sheriffs,
wno accompanied him.
