TOLJ8DO, Ohio, Sept. 26.—Firm of
voice from nearly two days saving of
the throat muscles, Republican Nomi
nee Hughes started his second day's
Invasion of Ohio today In two early
morning speeches. The republican
Buckeye committee arranged a sched
ule which aroused the candidate be
fore eight o'clock and which fixed for
him five speeches during the day. Dr.
L. D. Alexander Jr., his throat special
ist, was on the job before eight
o'clock when Hughes made his first
speech at Findlay and was kept busy
during the most of the day with
sprays and throat pastilles.
Hughes' voice today did not show
any need for the hours whiclx his
physician spent getting him In shape.
But that is the thing which Dr. Alex
ander fears, that is, that Hughes,
feeling his voice fairly clear, will
overwork his vocal cords. Hughes it

most in his nortnward swing jbcross
Ohio today. In addition, he dwelt
forcibly on the Adamson bill, compro
mising the railway strike—being giv
en an enthusiastic reception every
where.
One thing which bothered Hughes'
managers on the tour today was the
persistent way in which Governor
Willis of Ohio contrived to project
himself into the limelight. In the
parade at Dayton yesterday they
pointed out that the republican gub
ernatorial nominee stood up In his.
carriage which followed Hughes in the
parade—and took advantage of any
cheers which Hughes' appearance
e.voked. Hughes remained seated
during this stunt. At the Dayton fair
grounds they also noted that Willis
spoke the longest of the speakers, de
spite the efforts to cut him short,
keeping Hughes waiting to speak. At
the early morning stops today, Willis
was full In the public glare.
Leaving D«yton early in the Burn

the republican national republicans
speakers' bureau at eight o'clock. It
was an added stop, put on the sched

other stop was added at Bowling
Green. The added speeches made
Hughes' burden for the day greater—
but he was feeling fine and lit and
took the burden up in the face of
pleadings by Mrs. Hughes and Dr. Al
exander.
After his appearance today, Hughes
was scheduled for three day speeches

LONDON, Sept. 26.—Twenty-nine
persons were killed in last night's
Zeppelin raid on England, the second

French, commander of the home

A number of small houses were

were successfully driven away from
industrial centers. No damage was
done to factories or military estab

Seven Zeppelins took part In the
raid. The south, east and northeast
counties and north midlands were at
tacked, principally industrial centers
in the latter region.
Anti-air craft guns played upon
the raiders with considerable effect

was brought down. The loss of the
two Zepipellns In Saturday night's
raid did not deter the Germans from
risking more airships in bombing
attacks, but some British aeronautic
experts believe s'maller dirigibles in

which offer splendid targets, will

GARRISON IS ATTACKED
Those Who Did Not Surrender and

Slaughtered by
Villistas.
[By Webb Miller, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
JUAREZ, Mexico, Sept. 26.—Roving
bands of bandits are reported operat
ing less than fifty miles south of the
international border today.
With the arrival of several wpund
ed soldiers here yesterday, news of
the battle of Samalyuca, forty-two
miles south of this city, spread
rapidly, causing apprehension among
the townspeople of Juarez. Accord
ing to reports current in the streets
and sent by mining men from the
vicinity of the reported battle, three
hundred bandits, believed to be Vil
listas, fell upon the sixty de facto sol
diers garrisoning Samalyuca. Part of
the garrison surrendered and joined
the bandits.* Those refusing to join
were slaughtered. The wounded were
left behind and were later brought
north to Juarez.
At military headquarters here, a
clash between Carranzistas and ban
dits was denied, but one officer ad
mitted there had been an action and
that tjiere was a reason for the hur
ried departure southward yesterday
of General Gonzales with 500 cavalry.
Warehouses, mills and the superin

mine, a Guggenheim property, at
Sierra Mojada, Coahuila, have been
looted and burned by bandits calling
themselves Villistas, it was learned
today.

In view of the high cost of ma
terials, it was understood yesterday,
prosecution would be difficult. Dis

construe the decision reached at a
