Man is Not Punished for His Sins But
By Them, Declares Max Wardal!
at City Hall
"Man is not punished for his sins,
but by them," declared Max Wardall
last night in his lec ture at the city hall.
"There is no God in the heavens that
punishes us when we do wrong and re
wards us when we do right," said the
lecturer, "There is only His will im
pressed upon all living things and His
will is expressed in natural law. Whez.
we deviate from the law scx-ncr or la
ter a reaction sets in and we suffer.
This is the law of compensation and
it works with infinite nicety and pre
cision. It even takes account of idle
and foolish words. As the Master
said, 'For every idle word that men
speak they shall account thereof at the
day of judgment." The day of judg
ment is not postponed until some far-
off time! reckoning, but each mdiuent
of time' we are being judged in na
ture's court of justice. We niuBt not
worry when some one does us an in
jury, for he who wrongs another can
not escape from the consequences of
his act any more than the unstable
bouse can escape from the law of grav-
)ur part in the little drama
should be to hold still and seek by for
giveness and good will to lessen his
suffering."
Tonight Mr. Wardall will lecture on
"The Real Supermen" at the same
time and place. The lectures are free
and all are given welcome.
The speaker was introduced by E.
Hamilton, United States commissioner.

ed out, 'Jes' look at them Oklahoma

Hard Surfaced Roads for Grady County
Would Cost Million Dollars But
Would Be Worth the Money
PERMANENT ROADS
ALONE GET AID
County Can Issue Bonds Only for Thai
Class But Townships May Build Any
Kind of Roads from Bond Issues
With representatives from Rush
Springs, Ninnukah, Amber, Pocasset,
Tabler, Middleburg, Mingo, Bradley
and Chickasha presont, at the meeting
held at the city hall here Monday eve
ning practically all phase of the good
roada problem In Grady county were
discussed, a wide diversity of opin
ions being expressed concerning tho
best method of solving it.
It was brought out early in tho
meeting that under the new law the
county is without authority to issue
bonds for road purposes unless the
roads are of the "permanent" kind,
defined by the statute to be hard-sur,
faced macadam or som similar ma
terial. Townships, however, are au
thorized to vote bonds for any kind of
roads. The final outcome of , Iho dis
cussions was the decision to" Roi' for
the submission of a bond issue tor
bridge purposes and then endeavor to
get the necessary roads built by town
ship action. ,

concerning the kind of roads desired
by the various communities.
Abandon Original Plan.
The orginal plan for a bond Issue
to improve the state highways, con
necting all the market places in the
county, was dropped when it was dis
covered that funds derived from a
bond Issue could be used only for
"permanent roada." In the county
the state roads as at present surveyed
cover about 223 miles and it was stat
ed by County Engineer CoV.y that tho
cost of hard-surfacing them, in addi
tion to the preliminary work required,
would be over one million dollars. It
was generally agreed that a bond issue
for anything like that amount would
be impracticable at this time though
om of those present argued strongly
tha the time had come for a step in
that direction.
Wm. Stacy, farmer near Lu lie.
said. "If we can get the county to
build bridges the township can take
care of the roads. At the present time
with only limited towns-hip funds our
money is exhausted toon as we
have built a bridge or two ana we can
do nothing for the roads. I believe
