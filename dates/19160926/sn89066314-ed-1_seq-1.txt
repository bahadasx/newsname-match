BRITISH IN COMBLES
AFTER lyOUR FIGHT
Allies Take Pivot Point of
Teuton Lines in Fur
ious Battle.
FRENCH ALSO GAIN
Greatest Feat of Somme Of
fensive Germans Lose
Many Positions.
Br United Tress.
LONDON', Sept. 2C Combles. pivot
point of the whole German battle lino
from Bapaume to Pcronne, has been
captured by the British after eigtheen
hours of most furious battling north
of the Sommc.
General Haig this afternoon an
nounced that British troops entered
Combles, overcoming German resist
ance. The enemy's losses, the official
report said, were severe.
The British ictory achieved after
three weeks of desperate driving
against the German "center Is the most
striking single achievement of the
whole Somme offensive.
It removes one of the last two ob
stacles to an .Anglo-French thrust
to sweep the Germans out of Peronne,
one of the two objectives of the great
Allied offensive.
The capture of Combles followed a
day and a night of most brilliant Al
lied successes, including the capture
of the Ullages of Morval and Boeufs
by the British and Rancourt and
Freglcourt by the French.
In summing up the day's success,
ful operations, General Haig reported
1,500 Germans were captured by the
British and that more prisoners were
being brought in.
Combles fell after thrusts by British
and French in yesterday's fighting
that threw a noose about tie Ger
man garrison and made its escape al
most impossible. For weeks the Ger
mans have used the town with Its
wonderful system of fortifications as a
pivot point from which to swing at
tacks north and south of the Allied
lines.
The British not only gained this im
portant victory but pressed forward
In their drive toward Bapaume last
night and early today. A strong re
doubt near Guerdecourt fell before a
British attack.
The French also swept forward
again last night, carrying Freglcourt
and later repulsing German attacks
against positions won yesterday.
While the British were entering
Combles French troops captured
Freglcourt, a little more than a mile
north to northeast of Combles, closing
still further the Anglo-French noose
about the German garrison In that
town.
The capture of the village was ac
complished with scarcely any lull In
the great battle that began yesterday
when Uie Anglo-French forces ad
vanced simultaneously on a 12-mlle
front.
French detachments had peached
the outskirts of Freglcourt while oth
er forces were occupying Rancourt
and driving the Germans from posi
tions further south-

TO INVITE BUYERS
Columbia Merchants Join
Missourian Fare-Fund
Trade Festival.
"Come to Columbia to Trade" is the
invitation that the merchants of Co
lumbia are extending to the people of
Boone County in the co-perative
Fare-Refund Trade Festival that is
being planned for the week of Octo
ber 9 to 14 Inclusive.
There are approximately 5,000 fam
ilies in Boone County outside of Co
lumbia. This includes the cities of
Centralia, Sturgeon, Rocheport, Ash
land, McBaln, Clark, Hallsvllle, Hint
on, Huntsdale, Harrlsburg, Hartsburg,
and about'two dozen other postoffices
and Ullages. In the plan, which the
merchants will follow an invitation
will be extended to every family In the
foregoing towns and also on the rural
routes to visit Columbia during the
second week of October.
To showxthe people of Boone County
a proper welcome, the merchants are
co-operating to repay railroad fares
of every family that visits Columbia
during the week indicated. In case
persons come by wagons or automo
biles, their mileage will be repaid the
same as though they came by train.
The mileage will be repaid through a
sj stem of schedules for every town in
the county. The schedule of towns
with the mileage will be printed and
presented to every visitor during the
week.
The system adopted proides for
purchases at different stores. The re
funds will be made in proportion to a
moderate system of purchases at va
rious stores in Columbia.
Several merchants have already sig
nified their intention of co-operating
in the Fare-Refund Festival. Among
them are the following:
Fredendall Department Store.
Victor Barth Clothing Co.
C .B. Miller-Shoe Co.
Will E. Smith Dry Goods Co.
Branham, Hlnkle Co. Ladies-to-Wear.
Sykes and Broadhead Clothing.Co.
E. H. Guitar Shoe Co.
Rcnie Hardware Co.
Parker Furniture Co.
The merchants have selected the
second week In October for the Trade
Festival because the stores all have
their fall and winter stocks on dis
play. Many of the merchants are
planning to decorate their stores for
the occasion.
The plan used by the merchants of
Columbia is similar to plans used in
Springfield, Sedalia, Nevada, Chilll
cothe, and other cities of the State.
John W. Jewell of Springfield -who is
visiting in Columbia, said yesterday
that when the Trade Festival Week
was held In Springfield last spring,
that thousands of people from the
Springfield trade territory visited the
city during the week, some even com
ing to the city from towns more than
a hundred miles away.
In connection with the Trade Fes
tival, the Missourian will publish a
special Boone County edition that will
be placed In the homes of every fam
ily in the county. In this edition the
merchants of Columbia will make
their special offerings and bids for
the trade of the people of Boone
County. The edition will be distribut
ed through the mails on the rural
routes and by special messengers in
the larger towns of the county.
This is the first time that the mer
chants of Columbia have ever at
tempted a co-operative Trade Festival
on so extensive a scale.
Centralia Banker to Wed In October.
Joe E. Denham. cashier of the First
National Bank of Centralia, will be
married October 11 to Miss Bessie
Settle of Centralia. Mr. Denham has
accepted the position of cashier of
the State Bank of Thenopolls, Wyo. -

COMPLAINT IS FILED
AGAINST MRS.MURRY
Business Men Charge Mer
cantile Operation Under
Wrong License.
SHE TAKES ORDERS
Columbia Woman Who Is
Sales Agent Says She Has
Paid Proper Fee.
Definite steps to eliminate the sale
of merchandise In Columbia by any
but established merchants were taken
today by the Retail Merchants' As
sociation when a formal complaint
was filed with City Attorney George
S. Starrett charging Mrs. John F.
Murry, S06 South Ninth street, with
violation of the city ordinance govern
ing the operations of mercantile
agents
It Is complained that Mrs. Murry is
taking orders for Stix-Baer-Fuller
XP Grand Leader) of St. Louis
without having taken out the proper
license. The ordinance covering the
taking of orders for an out-of-town
establishment imposes a license fee
of $25 a day, with no license issued
for less than six days. Mrs. Murry
's reported to be operating under a
regular merchant's license. She is
said to have been representing the
St. Louis concern for the past two
weeks.
"We have warned Mrs- Murry sev
eral times during the past two weeks
through the city authorities that she
is operating under the wrong license,"
said Secretary V. B. Jones of the Re
tall Merchants' Association this morn
ing. "Our understanding Is that Mrs.
Murry is taking orders, and the city
ordinances definitely classify the per
son taking orders as a mercantile
agent.
Monopoly 'ot Desired by Merchants.
"It is not the purpose of the Re
tall Merchants' Association to "create
a monopoly in Columbia. Nor do we
wish to keep anjjbody from coming
here and engaging in business, hut we
do not want an out-of-town concern
to come in and reap the benefits for
a few -days through an agent and then
leave.
"We would welcome Stix-Baer-Fuller
to come here and establish a busi
ness, but it is not fair for the local
merchants" with goods worth $25,000
or more on their shelves to be com
peted against In their limited field by
million-dollar concerns of the big
cities without these concerns paying
a license.
"If these largo concerns wish to
operate through an agent here, it
seems to me that they should pay
the license. But the agent here is the
only one we (can hold responsible
under the present circumstances."
The city statute governing the op
erations, of mercantile agents was
adopted by the City Council In 1915.
It is known as City Ordinance 299.
The ordinance reads as follows:
"Any persons who shall maintain
any place, stand, or booth where or
ders for future delivery of goods,
ares or merchandise are solicited'
or taken, or who shall travel about
from place to place soliciting or tak
ing orders for the sale of goods,
wares or merchandise for future de
livery, shall be deemed a mercantile
agent or canvasser; provided that
traveling salesman taking orders from
retail irerchants only shall not be
deemed to be included in this defini
tion, and provided that no such
license shall be issued for a period
of less than six days."
Believe Merchants Need Protection.
"If Mrs. Murry is taking orders for
an out-of-town firm without a mer
cantile license she is not within the
limits of the ordinance covering this
kind of salesmanship," said City At
torney George Starrett this afternoon.
"It will be necessary to prove this,
however. I do not think that St.
Louis merchants should be allowed
to send their goods Into Columbia
and take away the profits of the local
merchants."
The ordinance covering the matter
of mercantile agents was passed by
the city council for the express pur
pose of stopping the selling of goods
in Columbia by out-of-town firms,"
said Mayor J. M. Batterton. "The
license fee of $25 a day, with a mini
mum time limit of six days for a
license Is Intended to be prohibitive.
It is- necessary that our merchants be
protected if the city Is to get the bene
fit of Its own business."
Mrs. Murry holds that she became
