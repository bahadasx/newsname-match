The Monday Morning World
Beginning October 2, The World will publish a Monday
morning pnper, making Tulsa one of only a few cities of
equal population in the United States where a Monday issue
of a morning paper is published. The World has long had
this step in mind, but the constantly increasing cost in every
department of the publishing business, together with tho ex
periences of practically every other city in the country that
a Monday morning paper is almost always published at more
or less of a loss, has caused The World to delay taking this
step as long as possible. However, we believe that the per
manency of t he growth of Tulsa with its constantly widening
scope of trade nnd influence in its territory entitles it to the
best there is in every line of business, nnd in keeping with
tho high standing for enterprise ami metropolitanism which
Tho World already enjoys b n at home anil abroad, it will
begin the publication of a seven days a week paper, confident
that the public will appreciate its efforts nnd that the local
merchants as well as the reading publio will be greatly ben
efited. While the cost of paper and other expenses of pub
lication have been greatly increased, tho readers of The
World will get the Monday morning issue without additional
cost at this time.
There are only five Monday morning papers in tho state
of Missouri, one in the state of Kansas and Tho World makes
the second Monday morning paper in the state of Oklahoma.

City Says Oklahoma Is
Sure to Fall in Line.
Theodore K. Hurton, fi rtner
l ulled Stales senator from Ohio,
will make three more speeches
in Oklahoma In support of the
candidacy of Charles K. Hughes.
Ills Itinerary is as follows:

tember an, auspices Cniverslty
Young Men's Republican club;
(iatbr'e. .') 30 Tuesday afternoon,
September 2; Ponca City, i
o'clock Tuesday night, Septem
ber 21).
WIIFN' Th lore K Burton, Re
publican field marshal and for
1.1 years one of America's foremost
statesmen, had concluded stripping
the Democratic political pcrsoniiKe of
ts garments of dlllusion yesterday aft-
eraoon before an sudience which com
fortably filled the Majestic theater,
had removed its prosperity pads and
Its false war teeto, he left It shivering
and weak-kneed, void of Its vaunted
Mroiitflh, a thing for Jest and not fi r
adailration.
There was nothing of the rampant
demagogue in Senator Ilurton's dis
sertation. He did not stoop to mud
dinging-, but in a dispassionate an I
analytical manner held up for ridicule
tho of'pritig of the present power.
ICvery flaw, every vasclllatlng tend
ency, every dilatory tactic, and there,
were aplenty, he bared to the calm
cold light of publicity. ,
Then when he had finished to the
satisfaction of all those who mid ears
to he ir, he turned his hearers' atten
tion to tho broad ideals of the Re-
puMlcii. party, to Its humi.nit.ir! an
aspirations and its pure American
.tandards and pictured the steel
libbed prosperity and peace Willi .sat
isfaction which will come If the ei.
O. P. ts placed In ascendency In the
coming election. And he predicted
that it would.
"For the uplift of industry, for the
growth of clilcs and the enlargement
In a virile way of towns, for the up
lift of humanity, it Is our duty to
place the party of Lincoln where It
belongs at the head of the nation,"
Mr. Hurton urgid.
"And," he lidded. "Oklahoma must
he'p do it. This state Is counttd in
the doubtful column bv those not so
familiar as I am with the people
and conditions In this state. I do not
count It In the doubtful column, bu
band In hand with that great major
ity of sister states which will sweep
on ta victory."
Was Here Itefore.
Mr. Hurton began his address by
comparing his present visit with the
one made here previous to the ke
puhlii.an national convention at Chi
cago last summer. Then he came here
to talk from a nonpartisan standpoint,
thinking little of the party issues. This
time hr declared that ho came with
a great sense of responsibility, realiz
ing full well what burden lay upon
tit in nnd other Republicans In restor
ing the party and bilnglng order out
of the chaos and confusion which will
confront the I'nlted States Immedi
a'ely after the war.
Mr. Hurton arrived 1n Tulsa at 7
o'clocl; and departed fivr Muskogee
at 4 o'clock. Ills speech began at 2:30
and ho did not keep his audience over
an hour, lie Vas Introduced by II. II.
Kocerp. Republican candidate for
state senate.
The senator's stay In Tulsa was un
eventful, except for his address anl
a public reception at Hotel Tulsa dur
ing the forenoon. He breakfasted
few personal friends and his
was entirely private. It was
his wish thut
he should not attend
meals while here or
any elaborate
that he should now be showed any
special attention, a the wear mil
tear of tho campaign Would not
stand it.
A ib ligation of Muskogep leaders
arrived here and escorted Mr. Hurton
to their city
"I re-illze most fully." Mr. Hurton
declared as he plunged Into hii speech,
"thut the destiny of tins great nation
Is In the balance, that It Is up to the
voter--, the man at his business and
at the plow, wh-tber we shall con
tinue at the present destructive pace
or regain our footing and begin a
march to the upper heights."
He criitliiued, "I am proud of the
man who Is at the helm of our parly,
Ch.,rles ICvans Hughes. I know hill,
for bis worth, for his indomidable
courage, tor hi tenacity in the face
(f onstacles and for his firm st int
In the face of almost insurmountable
odds for what he believes Is rmht.
1 have followed his caret I sho e he
was governor and I I. i e never known
htm by act or statement to lower his
standards. He Is a man."
In speaking of the tariff Issue, he
said: "This is a mosi vital iiiicstioii
before the people today and the 111 -Kinnents
of tho Republican parly air

cause of the frightful war now raging
ill Kiiropo. At the close of this .strug
gle wa- may expect fiercer competition
than c or bt fore, partly from stocks
of goods which have acciiiiiulaleil but
which cannot now be sent here and
partly from the sale of articles vv hich
the poverty of the nations engaged
compels them to sell. More important
than this, however, will be the uni
versal effort of the combatants to
rehabilitate themselves by entering
our own markets and other markets in
which we compete with them for
lureir share of the trade.
"In order to gain a foothold anl
to regain as rapidly us possible their
foi mer positions every possible means
will be employid; wages may he low
ered. rue subject then of our own
industrial supremacy, Isith as regards
our domestic markets and foreign
markets, hius a new significance for
us. We do not seek to shut them out.
but wo do ask for fairness to our
selves for America first. The advo
cates, of the policy f freo trade, win
seem to prevail In the policies of this
administration, say that free trade Is
based upon rhe great principle o
division of labor, that Just as Individ
uals have superior capacity for the
making of certain articles or perform
lug special services, so It Is best to
lonvo to each nation tho production
and manufacture of that which It can
bring to the market most advantage
ously and cheaply; and thus there
should bo free Intercourse throughout
the world; If England and Oerinany
can make rlothlng more cheaply than
we, then these countries ought to
make clothing; If they can make any
tool or article cheaper than we, then
we ought to let them do It and look
to them for a supply.
It li maintained that the policy of
protection causes the misdirection of
the creative or productive energies of
1 pooplu; that their efforts should I
applied to the making or producing of
artli-les In which they have a sun
stentlal advantage, and that a pro
tective tariff diverts those efforts to
lefs profitable uses. This argument
entirely overlooks the all-important
d'fference between a nation and an
individual. That which every coun
try vhould seek is not merely individ
ual development but the sufficiency
ot national life, the very first essen
lil. We have in tho United States
between the two oceans, beyond any
nation on the globe.
"In ordvr to maintain that suffi
ciency, Indeed, our Independence In
th" true sense of the word, It is de
sirable thai the supplies that our
people rciiilre should in tho greatest
pos-oble degree be obtained at home;
this means not merely freedom from
tl'jpendenee- upon other countries
'n Hire of war: It also means in peace
the utilization of the great opportunities-
which belong to us because of
our great diversity of resources and
of the stimulus afforded by free In
litiliitlons and a population abounding
In Initiative and possessed of diverse
capacities..
The iiuestloii of foreign relations
he then discussed.
Wilson Kept I's Out of W'nr?
"There Is no more specious argil
runt used In this campaign than that
I'resittent Wilson has kept us out of
war. If we take a jurvey of :he whole
eoiintry, this claim on ills behalf Is
the cne which receives the widest ue
leptanee. Has he kept us out of war?
"First, let us take the case of
