That's the very first questoin that enters
your mind when you consider depositing
your money in a bank or making an in

It is a very reasonable pnd logical question. Money

right to DEMAND safety.

PUBLIC ROADS
We beg to submit, that during
our investigations, we examined a
large number of witnesses from all
sections of the Parish relative to the
condition and the need of public
roads.
We find that there is some com
plaint against the conditions o'" cer
tain of the dirt roads, notably the
road crourd the Irish Bend, and
the ro.-ul from Kamos to Amelia.
We understand however, that the
overseer is expecting to start on
these roads immediately.
We further beg leave to report,
that upon discussing the question of
surfacing the roads with gravel or
other suitable hard material, we
fing the sentiment from all sections
of the Parish practicable unanimous
that the Parish should at once, or as
soon as practicable, comrletc the
model surfacing now started, until
all roads in the Parish shall have
been surfaced, including the Irish
Bend, Cypremort, Bavou Sale.
Avoca Island, to the Chene, and
fvom Ramos to Catholic Church of
Boeuf. We find that this sentiment
orevails. even to the ext®"t of vot
ing and lewintr a special tax, neces
arv to this pnd.
We therefore recommend to th®
Police ,T urv , as th® Governin'* Bodv
havine- control over s^h m'^-rs
'hat cf.ns be taken looking to th®
'mmediate and final eemnmtion of
f his work as herein outlined.
RAILROAD CROSSINGS
We find that certain of the rail
-oad crossings in dû* Parish are
not in good condition, especially the
crossings over the Fri co and the S
n *ra"ks, just this side of Sorrel
'Ve advise that the road engineer
be instructed to take this matter un
wi*h the two rn-^ at once, and see
♦Vo* *hey are placed in proper con
didtion.

PUBLIC BUILDINGS
We have examined the Court
House and Jail Building, and find
both of these buildings, as well as
the grounds surrounding them, neat
ly and well kept, and in this connec- !
tion, wish to commend the jailer for (
the well kept and sanitary condi
tions of the jail, and the humane
treatment accord 'd the prisoners. 1
PUBLIC ACCOUNTS

the Parish and School Tree.surer,

the many courtises extended •>' d ■ •

THINGS LIGHTNING
DOES NOT DAMAGE
Lightning, that mysterious force
generated in the powerhouse of na
ture, which often sets fire to hay
stacks, frame houses and barns, has
never been known to seriouly dam
age:
Railroad trains or locomotives,
Buildings with metallic grounded
sides and roofs,
Buildings which have frameworks
composed wholly of metal,
Grounded steel windmill towers,
St' el battleships and cruisers.
Business blocks and apartment
honses in cities,
The explanation of this rbonomena
is simple, for most of these objects
••etidyci electricity so well that elec
tricity induced on earth is drawn up
through them and dispersed into the
atmosphere, thus dissipating the
charge of electricity before it be
comes strong enough to produce a
hash. If a lightning stroke to one of
these objects does occur, the mass
of metal entering into its composi
tion will usually conduct the cur
rent safely to the ground.
COTTAGE FOR RENT.

tions with water and sewerage. Ap
ply to Sol Loeb.
