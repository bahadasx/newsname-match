TWENTY-FOURTH YEAR.
CARLSBAD, NEW MEXICO. FRIDAY, JULY 7, 191
NUMBER M.
VERY HOT AT FRONT
WEEKS HEAVY BOMBARDMENT
NERVE-RACKING, i
Berlin, July 8, via London, July 4.
The correspondent of the Lokal An
Mirer, telegraphing Sunday from
'German headquarters in France, ds
eribei the opening of the Anglo
French alack aa follows:
"For aeven dayi and seven nights
rum of all ralibert from field guns to
long ii hip guns have itcadily hammer
ed Carman positions, camp an!
aheltera behind constantly renewed
wave of poison gas. The gas driftej
over, mingled with ithella, which a
they bunt, threw out corrosive benumbing-
fumes."
"Tho country between Ypres and
Roya win one vast hell during the
ling period of preparation which wj
double the length of thut which pru
coded the battla in Champagne la it
autumn. The only pauses came when
allien were mudo to determine
whether nn onnluught wai possible,
Gorman's first line trenches in many
pl.ice were completely under a hat'
of missels against which the beat pio
nr work wee helpless.
"It cerno a a relief to the German
troop from an almost unbearable
strain wliun the bombardment y ester
('ay ceased and trong columns ad
vanced. These did not attack thi
whole front, but brond sections on
either side of the Somms and Antra
livers from the British northern sec
tion to La Boiiuelle. Along the second
section from I .a BoUello the fifirst tine
trenche i also were demolished that
they offered no support for their hura
pressed occupants and retirement
was decided upon and executed. The
ruins of Fricourt, Mnmetx and Cur!u,
v.hlch Iry in line with the front trench
es had to be abandoned to the enemy
who found here relututly his greater
success of the first day.
"Tho section south of the Somme
ranches to Llhjns, just couth of t'.to
Roman road from Amiens to St. Quin
tín. "TK material left behind In thi
a.tandonmcnt of the front tranche
was destroyed before retirement. Thi
struggle continúen along the who'"
front with enormous violence and ttv
utmo.it uiie of artillery both in recur
lont and counter-attack.
"Thee are the results of the first
day of this monstrous combat in
which the united forces of England.
France and Belgium with an incon
ceivable supply of munitions and can
i.on from the whole world, attempted
f breach the German front. The
first duy's success may he regarded
nr comparatively small. The loss of .
limited territory was expected; but no
sensible person will over-estimate thi
modest result of the first day's offen
sive since the abandonment of a bit
of trench here and there, a ruined
village, or a coupplpep ppppppppp
village, or couple of kilometers of
territory signifies little in view of the
many lines of our position sometime
r?n rows deep."
ANOTHER MURDER.
A preliminary examination was held
yesterday in tho justice court which
resulted in Matías Snia being held
without bond to await the action of
the grand jury. Matial shot Leandro
Gomes, another Mexican on the road
at the south west corner of the Low
er Greene farm, with a 38 six shooter
lust Friday night about twelve o'clock,
the bullet entering the body under the
right arm and rangeing back, shatter
ing the sninal cord, killing him in
stantly. The attorneys for the da
f .use pluceJ no evidence on the stand
and Uitf defdndunt was held without
hull. I; was in evidence that Sais had
told his f i i-ndrt thut Gomes called him
a bud nnme and he then shot him. I:
seems the young men wur nlono in tho
r sJ at the time nnd mii'l have been
at nuts for it is not likely (ionic
would have shot unless there was bad
blood between them.
Cruse Hernandez was arrested for
breaking and entering the saloon at
Sun .lose, and committing robbery,
Hurnandes broke in to the saloon a
bout noon Sunday, Mr. Everett report

Lorenjo Ortega was arrested for lar
ceny of three six shooters stolen from

When Stewart and Duncan went o

big six shooter that had been pawned
there, and Mr. Duncan having the
r umber of the guns stolen from the
Roberts-Dearborne Co., found this to
be one of the pistols, and the Mexican

was nublished toduV. siirned bv S.
Cosme Zafra, in which an agreement
was cited which was said to have

fra'a letter, the signers swore by the

country or group of Latin-American
republics being threatened by the
United States
The church of the Virgin of the
Pillar is one of the famous shrines nf

the alleged agreement was the cele
bration of the rentennary of Spain's
release from tho domination of Na
olenn. .afra states that nineteen nags of
Spanish-American countries, led by
that of Mexico and ended by the na-
tional cmblam of Chile, were deposit
ed at the foot of the Virgin's Pillar ai
pledge to keep the pact.
Commenting on this story, Zafra
says the statea ef Central and South
America must unite as a single people
against the United Statea. following
the discipline and abnegation of glor
ious Germany to rosist successfully
the colosus of the north.
