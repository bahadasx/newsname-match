Concert VtaigM.
Another rehearsal was held this af
ternoon-in preparation for the second
grandooncert which is to take plaoe
this evening. An excellent program
has been arranged for this concert
with Dr. Edmund Kraus as special
soloist, and it is hoped that a large
crowd will turn out for the occasion.
The concert Thursday night was
one of the greatest musical events of
the year in Grand Forks. It was giv
en under the direction of Jens H.
Flaaten of Duluth. Miss Sophia Ham
mer and Otto Clausen were soloists
and Jacob Schutz accompanist.
Fine Singing Heard.
The work of soloists, chorus and
orchestra was of the highest rank, the
music being forceful, moving and in
spiring.
In all the numbers the work of the
chorus was of an unusually high
character. Besides the singing of the
grand chorus there were two selec
tions by the Norwegian Glee club of
Minneapolis and the Red River Valley
Singers association, respectively, which
proved to be highly popular.
The program was arranged in such
a manner as to bring out the abilities
of the singers to the fullest extent
possible.
Miss Hammer is a soloist of great
ability, and In her work Thursday
night she more than sustained her
high reputation. She has a pleasing
personality, a Voice of rich quality,
and excellent methods of interpreta
tion. She sings throughout with the
ease of a true artist.
Mr. Clausen has a powerful bari
•tone voice of unusual merit. His inter
pretation of Bizet's "Toreador Song"
from the opera of Carmen was one of
the most thoroughly' enjoyable num
bers of the program.
Flaaten Good Director.
Great credit is also due to Jens H.
Flaaten, and hlB ochestra for the
highly artistic work which signalized
the entire program. Jacob Schutz, the
accompanist, also did much to make
the work of the soloists a success.
Following the concert Thursday
night, the singers repaired to the as
sociation headquarters, where a real
Norwegian sexa- was held. The fun
continued until the early hours of the
morning.
Reception Thursday.
A reception for the visiting singers
was held at the auditorium Thursday
afternoon following the parade. May
or J. A. Dlnnie welcomed the Visitors
to Grand Forks, and addresses were
made by President Julius Jaeger of
the association and other members.
The trophies won .by the American
chorus at the Chrlstlania exposition
were formally presented to the asso
ciation. and were accepted by Judge
.It. K. Hasaell of this city, vice presi
dent at large.
Emll Borg, for three successive
terms director at large of the associa
tion led the crowd in singing the
"Star Spangled Banner."
ISie.Fande.
The parade of all the singers and
other musicians in attendance at the
big Sangerfest occurred shortly before
S o'clock yesterday afternoon. The
men all marched in neat uniforms
and each group of delegates was
designated by Its distinctive banner.
Grand Marshal I. A. Berg led the pro
cession, and was immediately follow
ed by the Duluth band.
Arriving at the auditorium the
singers and visitors gathered to hear
the speech of welcome delivered on
behalf of the city of Grand Forks by
Mayor Jas. A. Dinnle. The mayor did
himself proud in a humorous speech

in which he. offered the freedom of
the city to the visitors.
Julius Jaeger, president of the as
sociation, responded to the welcome
by thanking the mayor for his hearty
speech. He started a "Dinnle for Gov
ernor" boom in expressing a wish that
if the singers of this society should
ever cross the Atlantic, as did 200 of
them in 1914, that they might again
be aocoinpanied by the governor of
North Dakota and that that governor
might be the present mayor of Grand
Forks.
The various trophies presented to
the singers who crossed the water on
the occasion referred to, were then
exhibited and were accepted on be
half of the association by vice presi
dent L. K. Hassell of Grand Forks.
The trophies Included a large wreath
presented by the city of Bergen, a.
diploma given by the exposition com
mittee of Christiana, and a beautiful
flag presented by the women of Chris
tiana.
Much enthusiasm was evident dur
ing the speeches and presentations.
Both Mayor Dinnle and President
jaeger were frequently Interrupted by
applause, and the former was given
three lusty "rah rahs" in true college
style. After the singing of "Ja VI
Elsker," the afternoon session ..ended.
Tonight's Program.
The program for tonight's concert

Sangerfest Notes.
The general sentiment among the
members of the association appears
to favor the holding of the next bi
ennial festival at the head of the
lakes. Both Duluth and Superior are
being mentioned for the honor, with
the sentiment somewhat in favor of
the former city.
Great credit is due to Jacob Schutz
tor the excellent manner in which he
accompanied Miss. Hammer at the
first concert. The two had no oppor
tunity to rehearse together until the
afternoon of. the concert, and ja sud
den change of plan made It necessary
for Mr. Schuts to play some music
with which he was unfamiliar. His
work under these conditions is felt to
have been of a high order of merit.
The meeting of the state vice presi
dents of the. organization which was
held this. afternoon is' expected to
facilitate to a large extent the work
of the general business meeting
which will be held Saturday morning.
There has been but little campaign
ing for offices during the Sangerfest
thus far. The usual custom of the
association is to "elect the president
from the city at which the next meet
ing will be held. For that reason the
members are waiting to see where
this will be before starting any cam
paign. A large number of the offi
cers'are also expected to.be re-elect
ed.
Plans for the continuance of the
publication of the. magazine of the as
sociation wlll. be. among the Import
ant matters to come tip at the busi
ness meeting. This matter was
thoroughly discussed at the session of
the vice presidents, and will now be
presented to. the general membership-
Informal concerts are being held
by the singers during the day in:man£
of the hotels, restaurants, etc, of. the
city. Whenever a number of ., the
members gather together, harmony is
practically certain to be the reeult.-
The sexas which are being held sit
the conclusion of the concerts are
proving to be among the most de
lightful features of the festival from
the point of view of the singers. They
are being largely attended and serve
to carry the members back to former
days.
The singers will be guests at the
final concert of the series whioh will
be given by the orchestra, and
soloists. The committee In charge of

that this form of entertainment would
prove more popular with them than
any other.
Dr. Edmund Kraus of Minneapolis,
who is to be heard in the concert this
evening, should prove an immense
success with the people of Grand
Forks. Dr. Kraus has a tenor voice
of unusual beauty and has made a
great success in the Mill City. He is
one of the large numiber of European
singers who have been compelled to
come to this country as a result of
the war now In progress.
One of the most attractive displays
in the parade held Thursday after
noon was that of the Viking chorus
of Crookston, Minn., whose section
was led by a youngster, dressed as a
Viking, and a young woman costumed
as Columbia, attended by children
representing Norway, Denmark and
Sweden.
Gunhar Host, who was a member
of the Bjarne chorus of this city for
over SO years, is here taking part in
the great Sangerfest. He is the guest
of Judge L. K. Hassell, the-vlce presi
dent at large of the general organi
zation.
In spite of the fact that Moorhead.
Minn., is understood to have "gone
dry," the members of. the Norrona
society of that place all appeared
with umbrellas in the parade Thurs
day afternoon.
The Hatton and Northwood singers
were headed by "Uncle Sam" in the
parade Thursday, the figure being
flanked on either side by the banners
of the two societies.
SIX SALOONS AND ONE
RESIDENCE DESTROYED
IN MONDAK, MONT. EIRE
Mondak, Mont., July 7.—Six saloons
and one residenoe were destroyed by
the conflagration which swept, this
city, yesterday morning. The local
fire fighting facilities were inadequate
to combat the flames and a call for
help was sent to Williston, N. D.
As it is expeoted that Montana will
vote dry at the fall election, the pro
prietors of the saloons may not re
build this, summer, but will a^wa^t the
returns ttam the election, at whioir

LIGHTNING STRIKES ELEVATOR.
'Michigan, N. D., July'. 7.—During
the electric storm last night, the^aifca
vator of Lamb Bros, inthis city wis
struck by a bolt of lightning and
caught fire. Fortunately the flames
made no great headway before the
drenching rain which was falling, and
the efforts of the local fire depart
ment succeeded in extinguishing
them. The loss to the structure Is
not very great.

Stream Now 18 Feet Above
Low Water Mark at Grand
Forks—Crest not reached
As the result of the heavy rains of
the past week, the Red River of the
North threatens to go on another
rampage and at Grand Porks is now
18 feet above the low water mark.
A .rapid rise has been noticeable
since yesterday and as the rush of
waters bound to result from the
storm of last night, has not passed
this point yet, it is expected that a
further rise of several feet will be ex
perienced. Should the stream rise
but a few more feet, the water will
break from the banks at several
points within the city limits, but oan
do no damage, other than to park
property, trees and the grasses.
The hugh abutment protector, of
the Great Northern railway bridge,
which was carried down stream by
the current, crashed into the ice
breaker south of the DeMers avenue
bridge and is now securely held. It
probably will be necessary to dyna
mite in order to releive the breaker
from the pressure.
At Fargo, the river is reported to
be rapidly rising and is now only
eight feet under the high water mark
of this spring, when thousands of dol
lars in damages resulted from flood
waters. Many families have been
forced, to quit their homes and seek
higher ground.
The rainfall last night at Fargo was
measured at 1.72 Inches and resulted
in a rise of the river of 1.8 feet. It
is not .blieved that the crest has been
reached and the danger of further
damage is becoming more serious.

ARE SWEEPING AHEAD IN THE EAST
General Letchitzky's Army Advancing in Effort to Com
pletely Overcome the Austrian Forces—Muscovites
Moving Toward Bagdad Forced to Fall Back.
London, July 7 —The second phase of the great battl«
on the western front has now begun. The artillery was
brought up to new positions and again is battering the
German defenses.
The bombardment extends as far northward as La
basee and Armentieres, and, according to the latest official
advices, is particularly intense. The British long range
guns are shelling the German positions and roads in their
rear. Until the infantry again leaves the trenches, it will
be uncertain where the next attacks are to be launched.
Besides inflicting losses on the Germans in men, guns
and territory, the Anglo-French offensive is reported to
have compelled them to withdraw some of their forces
from the Verdun front. Consequently it is expected here
that the army which for nearly five months has withstood
German attacks in that region, will have some relief from
the continual fighting.
On the eastern front, the Russians, who now appar
ently have even a better supply of guns and ammunition*
than their adversaries, are passing from one phase to the
next without intermission.
General Letchitzky's army, which conquered Buko
wina and cut the railway between Delatyn and Koromezo,
is advancing in an effort to completely overcome the Aus
trian forces on that front.
Rumania, it is said here, is awaiting some move by the
^exjtetjte fotces at Salonika. The near east is interested, in'^
tile Sattles throughout- the Caucasus and Mesopotamia.
The Russians advaiking^toward Bagdad, have fallen
back some 80 miles under the pressure of great forces, but
elsewhere from the Black sea to the Persian frontier, the
Russians are more than holding their own.
GERMANS MOVE MEN FROM EAST.
London. July 7.—A wireless dispatch from Rome says that word
was received there from Petrograd that in consequence of their triple
defeat in the sectors of Riga, Kolki and Baranovichi, the Germans
have begun to move their whole front toward the west.
Petrograd recently announced successes in the regions mentioned
in the Rome advices. The last report from the vicinity of Kolki, in the
crucial Volhynia sector, recorded the capture by the Russians of over
7,500 prisoners, half a dozen cannon and 23 machine eruns.
RUSSIANS BEGIN OFFENSIVE.
London, July 7.—The Russians began a tremendous offensive on
the Riga front, "where their artillery is destroying German trenches,
says a dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph company from Vienna via
Copenhagen. The bombardment, the dispatch adds, lasted 34 hours,
and the Germans were helpless before the Russian artillery, which can
now fire fifty shells, as against one in 1914.
