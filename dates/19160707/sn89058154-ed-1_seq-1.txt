NUMBER I
County
The present expense to the
government in mobilizing our
militia is fully compensated in
the lesson learned wherein we
may be short in matters necessa
ry in a hurried millitary call.
The greater satisfaction is.shown
that patriotism is not dead or
sleeping in America. Some had
become to believe that loyal blood
was not in the veins of America's
sons The alacrity with which
the state militia responded to the
call of congress and the president
shows a militant spirit in its
Spartan glory, when the emblem
of our liberty is assailed, or our
sacred soil invaded by a foreign
enemy, If the continued annoy
ances of the half heathens of the
Mexican republic could fire the
American fighting blood, what
would be the result of a strong
foreign foe in invading our soil.
It is a lesson .to the world that
we are not "too proud to fight",
but on the contrary volunteers
by the millions would go to he
front on a call for service.
Whether we do ( have to fight
Mexico or not, it is one of the
noblest acts ofv patriotic senti
ment expressed by our people
' since the war. It shows to the
world that we are not only rich
in gold, but rich in red loyal blood
to shed for our country.
Reminiscent
Tuesday morning, July 4, 1916, our
mine runs back to an event in early
boyhood, when sixty-two years ago, a
big 4th of July waB staged at our
home town, Carlinville, 111.
The event was to commemorate not
only the patriotic day, but the com
pletion of the Alton & Chicago rail
road to that point This was the
pioneer road, making its way to a
little town on Lake Michigan. It was
then one vast prairie to what Is now
ha aannnA hiarrraat. pi fir in fho TTnitfi1
States. This road's southern term
inus, or rather its initial point, was
Alton then a more important city
than St. Louis.
Two things were indellibly im
pressed upon our childhood mind.
First, the effect ol tne shrillest Diast
'of a locomotive whistle, as we with
others stood close by the panting en
gine, as it cama to a stop to unload
its human freight aboard freight cars.
The second event was while at the
grove where a big free barbecue, was
prepared, and - speaking was held.
This was when one man struck an
other with a heavy gold headed cane,
and knocked out his eye. That was
the first time we ever saw blood gush
- from a human being, and it startled
as equal to the battles now of the old
world, where millions of men bleed
and die. ' '"i .'. '
- It is quite a span, those 62 years,
and the same railroad is at the same
spot, jam! the beautiful walnut grove
has changed but little. But what
changes have come to the wild waste
of level prairie along the line! 7 he
best farms, handsome , homes and
prosperous towns and cities adorn the
route of the old Alton and Chicago
railroad, the first great railroad from
.south to north through the state of
Illinois. , . ;
Singing at Pleasant Sight
Independent:
As it is getting time for picnic and
singing and ' candidates to come
around, I will say in regard to the
singing at Pleasant Sight which we
have been having every third Sunday
in July, will have it this year the
Fifth Sunday in July on account of
the Hardin County singing at Shiloh
the third Sunday in July. So don't
forget the date the Fifth Sunday.
Everybody invited to come and spend
the day and enjoy yourself and see
the candidates; also I have been in
formed that wo will have an Old Man's
Quartet with us, and we hope we will
also have Mr. John Swaim and Will
Wilson with us, with whom moat every
body is acquainted.and it is understood
that they are both nice men; and we
will also have many good singers with
' os, so we invite everybody to come.
Since beginning these few lines I
am informed that we have a death in
our community, Mr. U. T. Mathis'
littles year oia son. we are very
lorry for his parents and relatives.

CONVENTION
ADVOCATED
Shall There Be One In Tennessee?
People To Vote On This Impor
tant Measure August 3, Next '
, .
NOTE. A aeries of article will appear
In our columns with reference to the pro
posed conutltutlomtl convention for Ten
nessee.' These artlclou are from the friend
of the movement, their motto being "Non
partisan, Nou-Sectlonal, Non-t'autlotial-
Just for Tennessee." .
At the regular election tor cqfnty
officer to be lipid in each county on
August 3d, next, tne people of Ten
nessee will be called on to vote wheth
er or not they are in favor of calling
a Constitutional Convention.
If the people vote in favor of the
Convention,- then on November the
7tlu 1-J16, an election will be held in
each county to elect 99 delegates who
will compose the Convention, the num
ber being the Bame as the number of
the memben of the House of Repre
sentatives. :
The, Convention will not undertake
to write a new Constitution. In this
respect it will be different from any
other Convention of that' character
ever hold in Tennessee. Its duties
will, 'be confined to formulating such
amendments to the present Constitu
tion as the Convention may see proper.
After this,, then the various amend
ments are to be referred to the people
for their approval or dlsapprovad; not
as a whole, but each voter will be al
lowed to vote on . each proposed
amendment separately. Such amend
ments as he may approve, he will
vote "Yes"; as to such that he may
disapprove he will- vote "No."
Thin will be following what is called
the Ohio plan, for in that State in
1912, a Constitutional Convention pro
posed 42 separate amendments, -which
were submitted to a vote of the. peo
ple, so that each elector voted his will
on each separate amendment. Tha
result was that the people approved
33 of the proposed amendments, which
thereby became a part of the organic
law, and the remaining four proposed
amendments were disapproved by the
vote of the people, and consequently
fell to the ground and were of no ef
fect -
The proposed Convention is ft) be
held under Chapters 110 and 111 of the
Acts of 1915, which see for all the de
tails thereof.
Congressional Race
Should we send a man to Congress
simply because he wants the office?
Should we send a man to Congress
simply to enable him to . receive the
salary that goes with the office ?
Should we under any circumstances,
send a man to Congress simply as a
personal favor to him?
To each of these inquiries our em
phatic answer ia NO. . , ;
jn the first place no man should be
considered i for this high , office on
other grounds than his fitness and
qualifications for1 the efficient "dis
charge of his duties, which are not
like the official duties of nearly all
other i offices simply statutory, in
which the law plainly sets out spe
cifically what the officer is to do.
The duties of a legislator require the
exercise of a wise discretion, a soutd
judgment, and a clear discernment of
of the effect of legislation upon the
public welfare. These necessary and
all important qualifications of a Con
gressman are the growth and out
come of experience and cannot be ac
quired in any other way. 1 ;
Mr. Sims is now serving his twen
tieth consecutive year in Congress
aud no jinan, since our' Government
was established, has ever 'served that
long who was a failure id that body.
It Is impossible for a man of mediocre
ability to advance from the lowest to
the highest committee service in the
Congress of the United States. Mr.
Sims has done this very ( thing. , He
started in a republican house, with an
assignment to the Committee on Pen
aions and now in a Democratic house
he is the ranking member, and ex?
officio Chairman of the greatest com
mitteeInterstate & Foreign Com
merce in the House. Undoubtedly
the people of theighth District take
pride in the high rank and standing of
their Representative in the Jaw mak
ing body , of this great Republic
Then why retire Mr. Sims in the full
vigor and strength of body and mind
simply as a favor to a new, inexperi
enced and untried man, who, whatever
his merits may be, cannot for many
years reach the heights of legislative
service now occupied by our present
member. . - , ' "
At a time like the present, when
the very foundation - of Civilization
and social order are disturbed and
all but destroyed in more than half
the civilized world, is it the exercise
of wisdom and good judgement on the
part of the people to give up a tried
and experienced legislator to make
room for an untried and inexperienced
man? Paris Ppst Intelligencer.

LEADERS FOR STATE
WANTED, PUBLIC LEADERS IN
TENNESSEE, AND .THE
REASON WHY..
American Commonwealths Now Com
mand the Services of Few Men
of Public Rank.
By R. S. KEEBLER.
That government is bad whose of
fices are largely filled by underlings.
It ia the glory of England that her
greatest men seek public honors. It
is the shame of our American com
monwealths that they command tha
itrricM ot 9 Jew ejj. ot tint r&oS
: We have made a runaamentar error
here in America. We have thought
that by tying the hands of our minis
ters we were preserving our sacred
rights. We have failed to see that if
an officer Is powerless to do evil he
is likewise powerless to do good.
Only dead men are harmless,
j Note the condition in our own State
of ' Tennessee. Our Legislature is
hedged about witn the most .trifling
restrictions,' such .as a stickling
schoolmaster might lay down for a
stupid pupil. It must limit its session
to seventy-five days. The caption of
its bills must be written just so, they
must be styled just so, and passed
just so. - Certain matters are excluded
from legilatlva interference altogeth
er. Let a man be Samson himself,
yet if Xe Is mistrusted and shorn of
power, he tends to become a weak
ling. In like manner our Legislature,
has become a servile, not a master
ful body, spending most of its tlmii
at squandering the public funds and
.pandering to local interests. When a
law of any consequence is enacted, it
is immediately attacked upon a dozen
grounds, because, forsooth, the head
ing is not on straight or it was not
Intoned the proper number of times
before its passage. From one hun
dred to two hundred and fifty pager'
in every volume of our judicial reports
is taken up with the consideration ol?
constitutional quibbles, a thing un
heard of in Europe. Empty form
have usurped the throne of reason,
And log-rolling has assumed the garb
of statesmanship. Like Gulliver in
the story, our Legislature is bound to
the earth by a multitude of petty
thongs.
We "place our Governor in stocks
and berate him because he fails !:
wiggle.- Though nominally the chief
executive of our Statt he cannot so
much as command the services of his
subordinates. He has no . cabinet
which he can make or unmake at
will. He ' cannot . systematize and
unify the public business, r He can
not take care that the laws are faith
fully executed. He cannot even call
out the militia in times of rebellion.
He is a cog in a -complex machine. Hit
is a puppet ruler. , - .
How can we expect our public serv
ants to lead us in solving the intri
cate social problems that beset .us'1
Great 'statesmen demand a wide latin
tude of powers. We 'must remove
from our legislators the consideration
of petty, details and local measures
as unworthy of their attention, and.
we must allow them freedom to de
liberate upon the weightiest matters
which concern the State. The courts
must be our sponsors ot justice. The
Supreme Court, must be given the
power and charged with the duty of
adopting simple rules of procedure
and ot unifying and reorganizing our
whole judicial system upon the basis
of efficiency, pur, Governor should
te made, as his name implies, the
director of the State's policies and
the executor of its laws. '
The present backwardness of Ten
nessee is due to our lack of master
ful men in public affairs. Where are
our leaders? Napoleons and Bis
marcks care not to play with jack
straws. Give them real weapons and
a clear field. Great men will always
appear to claim great offices; but lit
tle offices are the resort of little men.
Some day we shall learn in govern
ment as in art and life that in
unity and directness there is power.

Declines the Presidency
I wouldnt give a copper cent . ,
To have the job of President;
Be pulled and hauled about; and then
To have a million hungry men
A-flatterin and a-slanderin me 4
I wouldnt have it, no, sir-reel
To-day a neighbor said: "Buck Snort,
Ye aint a-gittin what you oit;
Youve got a heap of common sense,
More than the most of Presidents;
I aint a-tellin you no lies;
We need a man about yore size;
"We'll send you up to Washington
Before you say Jack Robinson;
It's time that Tennessee once more
Was walkin throughthe White House door.
When in the sheriff race you spoke
, I thought of Jackson and of Polk."
I never let on that I knowed
How he'd abused me on the road
Behind my back; said he would swear
I couldn't tote guts to a bear,
, . And wouldn't roof a shuck-pen so
That it would keep out rain and snow.
I jest remarked: "The President "
Can't go where yesterday I went:
Out in the garden, where I knelt
' And with my fingers gently felt
- r Some taters; and to my surprise,
I found they was of grabblin size.
"Them new potatoes, by and by
V j !. Sallie will Cook with chicken pie, " '
- Along with dumplins rolled out thin
I fill up on em to my chin!
I know that Woodrow's grub is good,
But this here's satisfyin food."
And now I'll say I wouldn't swap
My home and farm for Woodrow's crop ,
"Of cares and troubles; twouldn't suit
With twice his salary to boot.

The Wise Saying of a
Great Business Man
When you get a good customer strive to keep him, but
when you cet a bad one strive to keep yourself. The Mc
Caskey System will help you to this end. The desirable cus
tomer will appreciate and is really entitled to an itemized
statement of his account with each purchase. The Mer
chant can furnish it to him with no extra cost or labor with
the McCaskey System. The undesirable customer don't
want to know, neither does he want his merchant to know
what he owes. The McCaskey System keeps both posted.
Take the wise saying of the great business man; keep
your good customer by furnishing him vcith an itemized state
ment of his account. Keep yourself from the clutches of
your bad customer by keeping yourself posted.
' , ' The McCaskey Register
will do this; why not buy one?
