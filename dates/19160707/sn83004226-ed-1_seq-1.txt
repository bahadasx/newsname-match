quality of oil at a depth of IS feet.
The well will be shot snd drilled deep

as can be found in the world and that
they are assured of a rich held. Mark

L0UI8A SCORES VICTORY.
The Louisa ball club filled their en
gagement with the team at Wayne
Court House, W. Va, on the 4th of July
before one of the largest crowds that
ever witnessed a ball game at that
place.' . . -.
Louisa went forth to battle with her
picked team, and Wayne contested u-r
way to victory with the best that co.iM
be had. The weather was hot but the
game a played was even hotter. The
score was -4 in favor of the Louisa,
boys. .
Charles W. Ferguson was on the
mound for the West Virginians, and he
was opposed by Marshall Meloy of
Louisa. Dismayed not a whit by the
might of his opponent, who with his
six foot four in height, and skill un-1
usual, had carved for himself at the
University of Michigan a niche In the
baseball world that brought him fame,
and the consideration of major league
managers, young Meloy took up the
gauntlet of battle and lead hi noted
opponent to the wire a winner. Meloy'
work waa most creditable, as be only
permitted the Wayne sluggers to garner
three hits In the entire route. His work
stands out a the feature of the game.
Ferguson was supported behind the bat
by "Boss" Brumfleld, a professional
catcher; while Meloy pitched to Harry
Burke. " . .
The wrecking crew of the local team
gave Joy to the rooter from Kentucky
the hit came when the nits were
needed. Louisa scored in the first, when
Vinson, first man up, hit safely to cen
ter; Henaley placed a nice sacrifice and
Pearl Copley timely singled to right.
The second run was due to the good
j base running of Bill Hale, the midget
I left fielder. Jim Cains clean single-to
! right, followed by a sizzling single by
Arlie Cain, was responsible for the third
run: number 4 and S of the runs made
by Louisa, came over the plate with
Harry Burke and Paul Copley, when
Vinson connected with a fast one for
two sacks; and the sixth run was due to
Hale's hit after Burke had registered
his second two-bagger. All told the bat
ting of the locals was pleasing.
Afield the star was Pearl Copley, who
covered the initial sack for the locals.
His work on this waa superb. Harry
Burke caught a beautiful game, and re
tired three would-be thieves at the
second station. Arlie Cain made a nice
catch In short right Held, and Hensley
accepted hia chances like the vet that
be is. '
Tha. locals are very proud of their
victory as Is their right. It was a bard
fought game, and victory under those
circumstance Is sweet. To beat Fer
guson on his home ground I deserving
of the highest praise, but to put up the
article of ball displayed in thia game
by our boys Is more praiseworthy.
There will probably be a return game
at an early date on the home grounds,
and the fan of thl vicinity will have
opportunity to witness tha skill of the
local club.

Gentlemen: It give me pleasure to
annnunce to you that effective Sunday,
July nth. train No. 38 will leave Ash
land at 4 p. m. daily Instead of 2 p. m.
This puts this train back on its old
schedule. I wish to say In connection
with recent newspaper comments upon
this schedule, that we hav considered
them carefully, and are now, as at all
times,' ready to yield to the majority
of public opinion. In changing this
schedule, we were of the opinion that
we were accommodating the majority
of our patrons, but it has developed
that the old schedule seems to be nura
favorable, and therefore we are revert
ing to the original schedule.
You will, np doubt, receive request
through the proper department to ad
vertise this change, but if you desir
to do so, you will be at liberty to an
nounce now that this change will prob
ably be made. Yours truly,
L. B. ALLEN, General Supt.
