RECORD OF WORK ON
BOISE PROJECT IN
MAY
The Réclamation Record for July
is at hand. The storage conditions
of the Deer Flat and Arrowrock re
servoirs for the month of May are
reported in the Record as follows:
DEER FLAT—Available capacity
in acre-feet 177,660; elevation of spill
way crest 2,518; elevation lowest gate
sill 2,487.6; storage in acre-feet, be
ginning of month 76,941, end of
month 69,940; maximum 76,491; out
flow in acre-feet 46,250; elevation of
water surface at beginning of month,
2,505.6; end of month 2,504.5; maxi
mum, 2,505.6.
ARROWROCK—Available capacity
in acre-feet 250,000; elevation of spill

of month 152,745; end of month 193,
745, maximum 214,000; outflow in
acre-feet 452,000; elevation of water
surface at beginning of month, 3,
158.3; end of month 3,176.7; maxi
mum 3,185.3.
Progress of Work
The progre ss of the work on tlie
Boise project during the month is
reported as follows:
Water was run in the main canal
without interruption throughout May
beginning with 1,600 second-feet and
ending with 1,910 second-feet. About
500 second-feet of this was run into
Deer Flat reservoir and the balance
used on the lands above the reservoir.
Irrigation demands were very
heavy during the fore part of
the month, and the entire lateral sys
tem carried a large head of water
without interruption during the month
Irrigation uses were rcduced consid
erably toward the end of the month,
due to the preparation for the cutting
of alfalfa and to a cold spell of
weather.
The only maintenance work of con
sequence done during the month was
in the nature of riprapping, a con
siderable amount of which was done
on the Mora canal; also some grout
ing of concrete-lined sections near the
maximum water surface was done on
the main canal.
There were no breaks of conse
quence during the month.
The month of May, like April, was
exceptionally cold and wi<ndy, and
the fore part of the month was un
usually dry. About the middle of the
month, however, a good rain fell,
amounting to about 1.5 inches, which
greatly helped out the spring seeding.
An exceptionally cold spell was ex
perienced near the middle of the
month, when five consecutive .nights
of heavy frost occurred, the temper
ature going as low as 25 degrees,
which is reported by the weather bu
reau to be the lowest on record for
this month. This frost did a very ma
terial damage to the crops in the
Boise Valley, even alfalfa and grain
being considerably damaged and the
major portion of the fruit crop being
killed.
Construction
Outside of the drainage work very
little construction was done during
May, mainly because of water being
in the entire system and also partly
due to the scarciety of labor.
The four electric drag lines con
tinued the drainage work throughout
the month with very good progress
The work in five-mile drain, however
was considerably retarded an account
of the large head of waste water to
be able to avoid during the irriga
tion season.
OUR MODERN INSTITUTIONS
All good Americans know that ours
is the most simple, direct, and mod
em of nations. Not for us the archaic
obsolete', and complicated "political
systems of effete Europe. The es
sence of our institutions is sound
practical common sense.
In token of which a band of earnest
gentlemen will shortly betake them
selves to the residence of Charl
Evans Hughes. There, expressing
their surprise and delight at finding
him home, they will solemnly and
with every outward symptom of plea
sure convey to hint the intelligence
that he has been nominated as the
candidate of the Republican party for
the office of President. . ...
A similar band of solemnized ctti
zcns will appear before the astonish«
eyes of Woodnow Wilson to electri
him with similar news. The latte
concealing his astonishment, will sur
prise the gentlemen with many pro
found facts concerning his unworthl
ness and so forth, and proceed to lin
prove the more or less shining hour
by making a campaign speech to con
vince them that they should all vote
for him. , ,
All of which calls to nnnd the Stew
ard of the Chiltern Hundreds, chiefly
because it is so different. As most per
pie know, an English member of pa
liameut cannot resign his seat, if
though you might suppose the IIou
would be tickled to death to get rid
of him, especially as it is too mite
crowded. In order to quit he has t
hold an office of profit under the
crown, and the stewardship of th
Chiltern Hundreds pays twenty shil
lings a year. So, to resicn in the
words of Gilbert Chesterton,
go to the prime minister, concealing
-■our air of fatigue, and s ay. It has
been the ambition of my life to he
steward of the Chiltern Hundreds.
The prime minister the.n replies, I
can imagine no man more fitted mor
ally and mentally for that high of
fice." He then gives it to you, and you
hurriedly leave, reflecting how the re
publics of the continent reçl anarchi
cally to and fro for lack of little solid
English directness and simplicity.
Chesterton thought it would be a
great joke on the British constitu
tion if he could get the prime minister
to give him the Chiltern Hundreds and
then startle and disturb him by show
ing the utmost interest in the work.
Just fancy what a lark it would be,
after the election, if our presidential
electors took it into their heads that
the constitution must no longer be
tampered with; that the fathers of
our country knew best, and conse
quently resolved not to be complimen
tary figureheads. Suppose they took
their job seriously, decided to be real
electors, convened in all solemnity
and elected Jim Mann president of
the United States. It would be im
mense fun to see it happen once,
only for the sake of discovering
what the New York Sun and other
panglossian bulwarks of the consti
tution would have to say about it.—

MINE OPERATIONS
ACTIVE IN IDAHO
Unusual conditions in Idaho make
impossible to estimate accurately
the lead output of the State, but ship
ments are being made at the rate of
about 360,000,000 pounds of lead a
year. There will be a corresponding
large output of silver and a great
increase in the total value of the
State's output of the many various
metals. This statement is based on
reports received by the United States
Geological Survey from its field office
Salt Lake City. Some of the large
ines in Idaho are greatly in
creasing their shipments, notably the
Hercules, Hecla, and Morning. The
amarack & Custer is temporarily
closed, the Marsh is not now produc
ing, and the output of the Stewart will
probably be much below that of 1915
"he mines of the Coeur d'Alene re
gion arc shipping lead ore and con
centrates at the rate of 30,000 tons
month, and zinc material at the rate
of over 8,000 tons a month. Blaine
County has added little to the lead
output, Lemhi County is far below the
record of former years, and the Wil
bert, in Fremont County, is also pro
ducing somewhat less.
Important changes are in progress
in the metallurgical industry. The
Hercules ore and concentrates are
treated at the plant at Northport,
Wash., where two lead furnaces are in
operation and two more are to be
built. Preparations are also being
made to build a lead plant at Kellogg
for treating the ore of the Bunker
Hill & Sullivan mine as well as cus
tom ore. New mills are being con
structed for the Ray Jefferson, Hypo
theek, and Idaho Continental, and one
is planned for the Tamarack & Cus
ter. As prices have become better
Wages and dividends have been great
ly increased.
Through the Snow Storm mine is
no longer a producer, the output of
copper in Idaho is progressing at
better rate than in 1915, largely on
account of increased shipments from
the Empire property at Mackay. Other
shipments came from the National
Caledonia,' and Richmond. A mill
was constructed on Little North Fork
for the Horst Powell property.
Shipments af crude zinc ore and
concentrates indicates a good increase
in the output over that of 1915. The
Consolidated Interstate and Callahan
shipped over 15,000 tons of zinc ma
terial during the first quarter of 1916,
a figure that indicates a rate of more
than 51,000,000 pounds of spelter
year for that mine alone. The Sue
cess, Frisco, Greenhill and Morning
contributed considerable amounts, and
the Terrible Edith, Constitution, Her
cults, Colonial ajul Highland Sur
prise were lesser shippers. A mill
was built for the Constitution mine on
Pine Creek.
Receipts for gold bullion for tii
half year jit Boise show an increase
over the same period of 1915.
BUNBALOW SECURES THE
TRIANGLE PHOTO SERVICE
Through the efforts of Mr. I. II
Waters the famous Triangle Phot
Plays arc soon to be shown at th
Bungalow theater. "The Patrons o
my house," declared Mr. Waters, d

BOTH SIDES OF SOCIAL
ISM PRESENTED TO
E
Editor Tribune:
If you had willfully set out to do
Socialism and the Socialists a favor
you could not have done better than
to denounce us in the terms you used
in an editorial in last week's Tribune.
Every epithet heaped upon our heads
was applied to Christ 2,000 years ago
and he and his party seemed to
thrive from it. What was Christ,
any way? Christ, the crucified was a
carpenter and soap-box orator—" 1 lie
leader of workingmen the agitator,
the disturber, Christ the Labor or
ganizer, Christ the Archetypal So
cialist Friend of the dwellers in the
pits of life, consoler of earth's ex
ploited, who once with the lash
scourged from the temple the unclean
graft brood of usurers."
The latter as today, being our "best"
people, influential citizens and occupy
ing front pews in our "best" churches.
If we are to believe the Bible it
appears He aroused the caloric of
bystanders and suffered far more than
a broken head and still his party
grew.
So keep up the good work, dear
Tribune, break us in pieces and throw
us out the window. Each piece will
take root and grow till the harvest
covers the earth.
Little did the rulers of Europe think
when they put the Socialists into the
front ranks to be rid -of them that to
carry on the war at all the govern
ments had to take over the indu
tries and now they can't go back.
That is the first step toward Indus
trial Democracy or Socialism.
But common justice demands
truthful account of news such as the
Bodle-Cupp affair. In not one old
party paper has there been an ac
count that would tally with the tes'i
mony of witnesses who were not even
Socialist sympathizers.
All admit an insult was offered our
comrade to which he replied face to
face—not from behind.
Now there are two kinds of dig
nity. History would blame us most
in a struggle with Mexico, being the
strongest. But among individuals
there are cases where a certain amount
of rashness, tempered by an intelli
gence sufficient to understand just
when insult and injury have been of
fered—is a twentieth century virtue.
As for the gold-headed cane and the
fifty dollars fine, symbolic of military
despotism and judicial tyranny as
they are, they have overreached
themselves as could he expected and
turned more sympathy than censure
to the offender. .
A BUMPTIOUS SOCIALIST
SOCIALISTS AND SOCIALISM
DEFINED BY SCHENCK
Estimates and Figures in Irrigation
Project
Editor Caldwell Tribune:
I am in full accord with what you
say in regard to Socialism and Social
ists. That is if I fully understand
what you mean. I take it that you re
fer to' to those that I referred to in
forrfier letter as blatent Socialist.
Thev talk without thought and say
things that are not mentioned in text
books upon Socialism, and their talk
while doubtless honest enough is a
drawback to au honest cause. No one
can say the principals of Socialism
are dishonest. Socialism in a nut
shell is placing the government of a
nation in direct control of the peo
ple. That is; place the people in
power. To make this fully under
stood, 1 will refer to the present
struggle that is now on in this coun
try, where a great battle of words is
being waged, and millions of dollars
will be expended in order that one
political party may be removed from
"power" and another placed there.
Mind you, power. This is the way it
is referred to and is correct. A bunch
of politicians with power to run the
affairs of the United States.
But you are in error when you re
fer to these as "average" Socialists,
or if "OU mean they are ignorant, they
have learned a few things is why they
are Socialists. The. average Socialist,
and the great thinkers of the party
(.not cultj believe in n world-wide
brotherhood. But at the same time
they believe in defending their own
country just as long as there are
country line. Even the Appeal to
Reason stands for defending our
border.
And while 1 am writing I will aim
to cast a little light towards the
Boise-Payette irrigation plan of plans,
for "A Reader."
The storage upon the head of the
Boise was surveyed and estimated
but not estimated in connection with
the plan of either of them. Three
reservoirs were surveyed, upon the
head waters of the Boise.
North Fork Site—Cost, $14.00 per
:re foot for 34,1X10 acre Teet.
Alexander Ranch Site—Cost $15.^5
per acre foot for 25,000 acre feet.
Bascom Ranch Site—Cost $15.4(1 per
acre foot for 45,000 acre feet.
These figures put the cost out of
reach and were not considered.
Those that were included in the
Boise river estimate were under the
Ridenbaugh, Paradox, Lake Geneva,
and Deer Flat. Under New York
Canal—Bond, Hubbard, Watkins, Lake
Hazel and Lake Katherine, at an
average cost of $6,00 per acre foot.
These were the ones considered for
the Boise division. Only Big Payette
lake was considered for the Payette
division, 200,00(1 acre feet at a cost of
$0.67 per acre feet, while for the Boise
SERVICE WILDER BRANCH
HELD UP PENDING
Except for one run in the vening
the motor car made no trips over the
Wilder brancli Wednesday. Officers
of the Caldwell Traction company
stated that regular trips will not be
made pending the adjustment of a
schedule and of arrangements with
the Oregon Short Line with reference
to freight and express shipments. As
yet neither freight nor express has
been accepted for carriage on this car
The difficulty over shipment of
commodities is due largely to the red
tape which the interstate commerce
laws throw about such changes. B
fore the traction company can take I
over this sort of business it is neces-1
sary for the Oregon Short line to
withdraw its tariffs and for the trac- 1
tion company to file tariffs. The mat
ter of approval of these tariffs must
be taken up with the interstate com
mission. For this reason it is antici
pated that several days will elapse be
fore the matter is finally adjusted.
Reserve Car at Hand
President Walter Sebree on We«I
nesday explained the arrangement un- I
der which a reserve car, to be storeiî
at Nampa, will be at the command of
his company in case the motor pur
chased by it should get out of com
mission. Under agreement with the
Oregon Short Line the extra car is to |
be housed at N'ampa, where is occa
sion demands, it may be used either
by the railroad company or on the
traction line. Heretofore the Short
Line has had but one motor at its
disposal for the runs out of Nampa.
While the new motor made the

GRASSHOPPER CONTROL
Four kinds of grasshoppers do such
damage to sugar beets and truck cnc
that the department has issued l'"ar
mers' Bulletin 691 by F. B. Miliken
giving practical measures for their
control. A number of measures rec

of
giving practical
control. A number of measures rec
ommended in this bulletin have to do!
with killing grasshopper eggs by
plowing, harrowing and disking, and
these methods to be effective must
be emploved either in connection with I
fall plowing or in breaking ground in
the spring. J
The bulletin states that grasshop-1
pers injure crops in many parts of the I
United States, but that areas having
an annu al ra infall of less than 25 I
inches are more subject to the at-1W.
tacks. This includes the country west
of the Mississippi with the exception I
of a strip 100 to 200 miles wide bor
dering that river and a portion of the I
northern Pacific states. In the eastern I
part of the semiarid region about I
equal damage is done to upland and I
lowland crops. Farther west the ab- 1
sence of upland vegetation formerly
confined the insects to the bottoms I
along streams where they destroyed a|
much larger proportion of the crops I
Four kinds of grasshoppers are es I
•pecially destructive and have been I
noted as the source as the greatest I
injury to Kansas truck crops during 1
the bad grasshopper years. Of these
the differential and the two-üned
grasshoppers are the two larger spe-1
cies, having yellow bodies from 1 inch
to 1 Yi inches long. The lesser mi-1
gratory grasshopper is from H to 1
inch in length and is yellowish-brown
with darker marking. The Bruner
grasshopper, which has no other pop
ular name, is about 1 inch in length
and is a greenish yellow, with three
bluish-green stripes extending from
the head backward across the neck.
The measures for control suggested
are based upon the fact that three of
the species have small wings in pro
portion to their bodies and can not
fly far and while the lesser migratory
grasshopper can fly long distances il
never does so except in search of food
or to escape unfavorable conditions
Young grasshoppers travel by jump
ing and crawling and arc most active
on clear, warm days, and at night or
on cool days seek shelter in vegeta
tion or under rubbish. As a general
proposition local control, especially
when an entire neighborhood joins
in active operations, Is frequently
effective in reducing the neighborhood
damage from these pests.
Two different measures of control
are suggested. One has to do with
preventing the eggs from hatching and
the other measure is concerned with
killing the young and adult grass
hoppers.
Destruction of Eggs
Measures to prevent the hatching of
eggs must he based upon the egg-lay
ing habits of the grasshoppers. Be
tween the time of coming to maturity
and freezing weather the females d
posit their eggs, one at a tim
curved, cylindrical masses or capsu
les in which the yellowish-brown c gR
are firmly cemented together and the
entire mass is covered with adhering
earth. The eggs arc laid preferably
in firm soil of a well-drained loca
tion. Abandoned fields, turn rows, the
undisturbed strips under fences, along
neglected roadsides, and on the banks
of irrigating ditches, and buffalo sod
along the edges of infested fields are
I favorable places for egg laying,
1 he eggs hatch about the time o
the last snring trosts, when wann wea
ther is assured. 1 lie young grassiiop^
pers push upward to the surface and
soon begin feeding on the nearest
| vejjetatton. At first they are almo. t
white, but exposure to light and a!r
soon devolons dark patches, which
make them difficult to detect. As they
grow larger the skins of the grass
honners stretch and are finally rup
tured and the young insects escape
This molting process occurs five times
before the grasshoppers are' fully
f>rown. ,
