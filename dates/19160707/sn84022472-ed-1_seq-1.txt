With the1 refuse now being" thrown
broadcast about yards and into streets
the board of7-health seems powerless
to remedy the situation. . Henry
Matthews, manager for John T. King'
at the Housatonic avenue yards of the.
company, asserts that he is 'doing
everything in his power to get, help,
declaring that he is paying wages to
the maximum of $4 per day.
: That there is dissatisfaction among
the drivers is evident, however, from
reports made to the board ..of health
that men are taking out the garbage
wagons in' the morning and abandon
ing them in the city streets. In some
cases the action of the drivers seems
to have been vindictive as the carts
were abandoned before noontime. .
Health Officer Edward A McLellan
asserted today that his investigation
of the situation seemed to show that
it is difficult to keep men in the ser
vice in view of the good business op
portunities in Bridgeport. The col
lection is delinquent though he would
not say today that the decaying gar
bage would become a serious menace
to local health. . .

of 845. feet on Bostwlck avenue, 740

TODAY
ACCUSE POLICEMEN OF
CHOKING AND BEATING
BOY WHO FIRED PISTOL
Charges were lodged today with
Commissioner John C. Stanley against
Policemen Martin Gottschalk and Ed
ward F. Bolger.' v
The charges were preferred by
James H. Kelly, cigar dealer of Fair
field avenue as guardian for his son,
James H. Jr., aged 17, who, it is al
leged was brutally beaten with both
the fists and night sticks of the two
policemen' and' also choked until semi
conscious. The acts alleged more specifically in
the complaint drawn under the di
rection of a local lawyer are said to
have occurred almost in the yard of
the Kelly home at TJi Sanford avenue
at about 2 o'clock on the morning of
July 4. At that time young Kelly
much more youthful than his actual
age denotes, was haled to police head
quarters accused of "discharging a
firearm containing blank cartridges.
In the city court he was fined S5 and
costs' with others similarly accused.
The account of the fracas as report
ed to Commissioner Stanley by the
Kelly boy is to the effect that the
youth came out of his house and be
gan celebrating. He was approached
by . the policemen and . without par
ley -or warning was grabbed by one
who choked him While 'the other with
full force of his clenched fists, struck

Suspicion that . Infantile paralysis.
the disease which "-as been ravaging
New; Tork city, is prevalent in Bridge
port took definite form today, when
Dr. Edward A. McLellan ordered the
transfer of Joseph Heigle, aged 1 year,
to Bridgeport hospital for clinical ob
servation by specialists.
Though the parents of the child as
sert vehemently that the paralysis
which has developed in the child's arm
accompanied by high fever since Sat
urday night is due to a fall, the at
tending physician decided that the
case warranted the closest attention
and this judgment was confirmed at
noontime today by Health Officer, Mc
Lellan.
The child is a son of Joseph Heigle,
an employe of the IT. M. C. company,
living at 78 Stillman street. Accord
ing to the parents the youngster was
being carried in the arms of another
child last ! Saturday when both fell
down a flight of stairs. x Swelling of
the arm followed with high fever and
digestive disturbances.
Dr. McLellan said today: "It is not
to be assumed yet that this child , is

Judge Webb Declares Board
? of i Appraisal's Action
i Invalid. .
The' ity administration received a
Jolt todlay when Judge Webb of the
superior court signed a judgment de
claring illegal and invalid the action of
the board of appraisal in assessing
Carnages on Beers street property
owned by Charles F. Grannis of Wat-erbury-
In March, 1915, the board found
Grannis' property was damaged to
the extent of. $1,000 by the extension
of Beers street from Cliff to Main
streets. Grannis took an appeal to
the superior court, claiming he had
not been legally notified of the hear
ing. H said the notice was not sent
to his proper address and had printed
signatures instead of written or type
written. ' A stipulation was drawn
up by City Attorney Comley and Wil
Ham B. Bonrdman, the la'.ler repre
senting Grannis. in which it wan
agreed that all issues should be found
for. Grannis with no costs for cither
party. -
Another decision hsnded down by
Judge Welib was In the suit brousht
by injunction proceedings brought by
F. L. Bradbury against the cily to re
strain the city from depositing sewage
In the Pequonnock river on the wes
bank from Berkshire mill to the Con

The city asked that the injunction
be modified because there have been
unavoidable delays in constructingtho

are accused of having beaten him with
clubs. He was then placedunder ar

, Though this side of the case Is pre
sented for public discussion, unf or
tunnately the gag rule "No. 113" of
the police manual, placed lb effect
under the order of the former presi
dent of the police board, George S.
Hill,, prevents either policeman from
vindicating himself in private or pub
lic until he appears before the com
missioners. .
Rule No. 113 reads: " apub
Ucations of a personal nature relating
to official transactions within the de
partment or otherwise are strictly pro
hibited." ' .
It Is the belief of department of
ficials today from assertions made at
the time of arrest that the defense of
both policemen will be "resisting ar
rest" though it is asserted that if the
actual beating and choking charges are
proved the officers will have difficulty
in explaining why two physically per
fect men had occasion to manhandle
a person of Kelly's size. '

the victim both myself and the attend
ing physician concurred that the de
velopment of the case should be
watched by other physicians. It is at
least suspicious and we have isolated
it. This is the only case as yet re
ported to us." ,
The only safeguards against a
spread of the infection here and the
care of children yet known to medical
men. was again reiterated by the health
department:
Keep the children clean. x
Keep them in good health. '
Be particular that flies, mosqui

no not come in contact with chil

Scientific research has made little
progress in study of the disease
for the past twenty years. Though
the Rockefeller institute has made re
search little has been added to known
symptoms and means for prevention.
New York to date has had 710 cases
reported v with 1S5 deaths. Comment
ing on this fact Dr. McLellan stated
today that deaths are unusual, most of
the cases remaining alive though their
limbs are practically crippled.

at 265 State street, made the successful
attempt to end his life while Maudi
Rogers, colored, 23 years old, of 839
Broad street, endeavored to asphyx

morning about 4 o'clock to go to work,
Passing Terwilliger'S room, she no
ticed the door open and two gas Jets
in the room burning. .Terwilliger was
lying on the bed. -
' Mrs. Olsen- returned tor the house
shortly after 8 o'clock and found
neighbors searching for escaping gas.
Opening her apartments, Mrs. Olsen
went to Terwilliger'S room and found
the door closed. The transon above
the door was also closed, the first time
Mrs. Olsen had ever saw it shut.
. .With the aid of neighbors, the door
was forced and the gas,, which was
escaping from two jet.?, was shut oft.
There are no windows m the room, so
the Lody was carried into, the kitchen.
Upon the arrival of the emergency

ALLJElJ ARTILLERY BCY.
London, July 7--The second -''phase
of the great battle on the westenst
front has now begun. The artillery .
has been brought up to new positions
and again is battering the German
defenses. The bombardment extends
as far north as La Bassee and Armea
tieres and, according to latest unoffl '
cial advices. Is - particularly - Intense.
British long range guns are shelling
the German positions and the roads in
their rear and until the Infantry again
leave the trenches it will be uncertain
wljere the next attacks are to be
launched. . ' ,
In addition to inflicting losses on
Germans in guns and territory, : the
Anglo-French offensive is reported to
have compelled them to wthdrkw
some of their forces from the Verdnu
front. Consequently, it is expected in
London ' that the army which fori
nearly five months withstood the G.er-:
man attacks in that region, will have
some relief from continual fighting.
On the eastern front the Russians,
who' now apparently have a better
supply of guns and ammunition than
their adversaries, seem to pass from
one phase to. the next without Inter
mission. General Letchltsky's army,
which (conquered Bukowina and cut
the railway between Delatyn and Kor

completely overcome ' the Austrian
forces on that front.
