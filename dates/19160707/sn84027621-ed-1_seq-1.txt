then walked back to Hurricane, Ala.,

the water went to Conception street
in Mobile and the top of the Louis
ville & Nashville station was blown

which has been marooned for two
days, also reached here last night.
The property damage there is large
but was confined to waterfront and
shipping facilities. The report said
that a maximum velocity of 104 miles
per hour was reached by the wind,
but that no lives were lost. Only one
point, Beloit, Ala., twelve miles from
Selma, reports a loss of life. Seven
teen negroes are said to have been
killed there and eight other persons
injured.

the safety of .thousand of visitors at
those places.

Direct Negotation to Settle Difficulties
MILITARY
AUTHORITIES
REPORT NO NEW MOVESVILLA AT
HEAD OF AN ARMY AGAIN
(Associated Press)
Washington, June 7. The formal
acceptance of Carranza's proposal to
settle difficulties by direct negotia
tions is ready to send to Mexico City.
Secretary, Lansing completed the
draft of the note and presented same
to the cabinet meeting today.
WILL MEET MEXICO HALF-WAY
The note was presented to Ambas
sador Arredondo after the cabinet
meeting. It contains two paragraphs.
The first expresses gratification at
the frankness of the last Mexican
note and the unreserved expression
of the Mexican desire to adjust the
boundary troubles on "a broad and
amicable basis." The . same spirit,
says the note, causes the United
States to equally desire an immediate
solution of difficulties.
"It is especially pleasing," says the
last paragraph, "to my government
that the de facto government of "Mex
ico is disposed to give quick as well
as practical consideration in a spirit
of concord to remedies which may be
applied to existing conditions: Re
ciprocating the same desire, the gov
ernment of the United States is pre
pared to immediately exchange views
as to some practical plan to remove
finally and prevent a recurrence of
the difficulties which; have been the
sources of difficulties." (

FIRST-HAND NEWS
FROM BLACK POINT
Frank Gates, quartermaster ser
geant of Company A, is back in the
city for a short leave, and for the pur
pose of taking to Black Point a num
ber of things left behind by the com
pany. He leaves for Black Point this
afternoon on the "Floridian," taking
with him numerous packages for the
boys.
Frank could not give a complete
list of members of the company who
failed to meet the physical tests. He
said that the Ocala boys who had fail
ed were George Davis, Rufus Raines,
Jack Galloway, Robert Curtis, Robert
Mock and Alphonzo Setzer. George
Davis will join the hospital corps, and
Robert Curtis will probably get in the
canteen, which keeps the soldiers
supplied with cigars, cigarettes, cold
drinks and such things, that are sold
by the government.
The company has all of its equip
ment, and is"anxious to be off for the
border.- -
The boys are permitted to go into

BITTER FEELING
II BUI
Resumption of Submarine Warfare is
, Among the Near Possibilities
(Associated Press)
Berlin, July 6, via London, July 7.
The campaign for resumption of a
full-fledged submarine war on com
merce goes energetically forward. It
was said that with the adjournment
of the Reichstag and the dispersal of
politicians this agitation by the navy
league,; publicists, conservatives and
part of the national liberals would
gradually lose its intensity.
On the contrary, reports from all
sections indicate that the agitation is
continuing undiminished this after
noon above and below the , surface.
Never a day passes without articles
in various newspapers to remind the
people that, according to the German
note the modification of German sub
marine methods merely was . tempor
ary and contingent upon a modifica
tion of the British blockade.
Advocate "Unrestricted Torpedo" '
Advocates of the "unrestricted tor
pedo" appear at every political gath
ering regarded as suitable soil for
their seed. The various newspapers
in sympathy with the movement have
almost daily a rubric for what they
call "British postal robberies" and
ever and again attention is called to
the fact that the blockade has not
undergone the slightest modification
since the dispatch of the latest Ger
man note.
The purpose of the agitation is two
fold. One branch is directed toward
the resumption of the submarine
campaign. The other is openly and
avowedly a movement against ' the
chancellor, Dr. von Bethman-Hollweg,
largely on the ground of internal pol
itics. Means Revival of the Submarine
Campaign
Some judges of the situation are in
clined to believe the movement will
lead, not later than September, to a
revival of the submarine campaign on
the old lines. Recent inquiries by the
Associated Press in authoritative
quarters indicate, however, that the
government for the present has no in
tention of resuming the "freedom of
action" mentioned in the May note
and of provoking conflict with the
United States.
One reason for this decision is the
desire to avoid any new measures
tending to prolong the war. Another
is based on the conviction that a re
versal of the submarine policy would
entail opposition from wide, influen
tial groups of political leaders and
powerful personages in the adminis
tration. Situation Changed Sharply
The situation in this respect has
changed sharply since the winter. It
then seemed as if the chancellor's
policy of moderation had scarcely a
friend in Germany outside of the so-
