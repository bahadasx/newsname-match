MAN KILLS WIFE AND SELF
James Johnson, Proprietor of the
White Help Restaurant in Hoi
brook, Murders His Wife a
Commits Suicide
A telephone message received
by the sheriff's office Wednesday
morning about 11 o'cloek stated
that a double tragedy had been
enacted that morning on the
Taylor and Pinedale road, about
one mile southwest of Taylor
Undershenff Clemons secured an
automobile and, accompanied by
Dr. J. W. Bazell, made a fast
drive to Taylor. Here he found
that James Johnson had killed
his wife by shooting her in the
left breast and had afterwards
shot himself in the head and then
taken an ounce of carbolic acid
Johnson and his wife left Hoi
brook Tuesday morning for Pine
dale, where they remained over
night. They were accompanied
by their ten year old daughter.
According to the story told by
the child at the coroner's inquest
held by E. T. Hatch, justice of
the peace, at Taylor, where the
bodies were taken as soon as the
child gave the alarm, her parents
had been quarrelling from the
time they left Pinedale until they
reached the crossroads near Tay
lor. At this point Johnson told
his wife, who was driving, to
stop the car and they would set
tle their trouble. When the car
was stopped Johnson drew a
small 38 caliber revolver and said
he would shoot himself. How
ever he changed his mind and
started shooting at his wife who
had jumped from the car. Two
shots went wild and then Johnson
leaped from the car, caught his
wife with his left hand and with
his right fired a bullet into her
left breast. Her death was
probably instantaneous as the
bullet evidently pierced the heart.
After shooting his wife John
son carried her body into the
shadow of the car, gave his
money and some letters to his
little daughter and told her to go
to Taylor to a relative's home.
He then attempted to kill himself
by firing the last shot in the gun
into the right side of his head
near the temple. The bullet
glanced and made onlv a slight
wound. Johnson then walked to
a cedar stump about 40 yards
from the car, hid the gun and
returned to his wife's body. He
then drank about an ounce of
carbolic acid and laid down to
die. Here he was found by
people who had been notified of
the tragedy by the little girl. He
was not dead when found but
died shortly after being taken to
Taylor.
The unfortunate victims of this
double tragedy came to Holbrook
about two weeks ago from Globe
and purchased the White Help
Restaurant from C. H. Wisdom,
who had purchased the establish
ment from them a year previous
ly. That Johnson had for some
time meditated upon the course
he took Wednesday morning is
evident from the fact that early
last week he purchased the re
volver and the carbolic acid. Also
the letters he had written to his
little daughter bore the date of
June 28, and told her partly of
his plans.
That the rnan had gone insane
from brooding over business and
family matters is the only chari
table construction that can be
placed upon his rash acts. Funeral
and burial Secured Thursday at
Pinedale.
Regular Meeting of Supervisors
The regular monthly meeting
of the board of county supervi
sors was held this week in the
board room in Holbrook.
Monday the supervisors sat as
a board of equalization, and lis
tened to the protests of taxpay
ers whose assessments had been
raised at the June meeting.
Many increases had been made
and many persons appeared and
asked that the increase be low
ered. In many cases this was
done by the board, while in
the increase was al
lowed to stand.
At this meeting a number-
of
bridge builders submitted
bids!
for the construction of the var
ious county bridges provided for
by the $63,000 bond issue.
These bids were opened and
were passed to the county en
gineer with instructions to re
port at the next regular meeting
of the board, which will be Aug
ust 7.
The board adjourned for the
Fourth and met again Wednes
day morning, when the routine
business of auditing and allow
ing demands against the county
was transacted.
Thursday the board considered
the two applications for a fran
chise for a water and sewerage
system in Holbrook, and finally
granted a franchise to the Hol
brook Light & Power Co. Jul
ius Wetzler, the other applicant
for a franchise for a water sys
tem, withdrew his application
and was granted permission by
the board to construct a private
sewer system to accomodate his
own property.
The board passed a resolution
increasing the annual salaries of
justice of the peace in Holbrook
and Winslow. The salary of the
justice in Holbrook was increas
ed from $360 per year to $1000
per year; that of the justice in
Winslow was increased from
$900 to $1000 per year. The in
crease will not become effective
until January 1. 1917.
The supervisors have held se
veral night sessions during the
week, and today they are finish
ing the work of auditing the
quarterly report of the treasurer,
and other county officials. The
session will end late today.
Independence Day in Holbrook
Independence day was a quiet
one in Holbrook. The town was
deserted by everybody who had
the price, or the inclination, to
leave. Some went to Prescott,
others to Flagstaff and a fair
size crowd went to Springerville,
at all of which places big cele
brations occurred. Snowflake
and St. Joseph, where small cele
brations were held, also drew a
number of people from this
vicinity, and in the afternoon,
practically all persons who had
not gone some place else went to
the tamarack grove, east of town,
and spent the afternoon and
evening in a picnic.
No serious accidents were re
ported from any of the celebra
tion, excepting from the picnic
in the tamarack grove. At this
place Judge D. J. Thomas suffer
ed a badly sprained ankle, the
result of an attempt to make a
home-run in a base ball game
which had been matched by him
self and Attorney C. H. Jordan.
It seems that in Judge Thomas'
club women players predomina
ted over those in Attorney Jor
dan's club, and in order to re
move the handicap of his club in
running bases, Judge Thomas
very gallantly volunteered to run
the bases for all the ladies who
hit the ball. It was in pursuance
of this laudable undertaking that
he sprained his left ankle and
since then has been walking
with the aid of a cane His ac
cident, according to Judge
Thomas' version, made the vic
tory of Jordan's club possible.
School District Boundary Fixed
At a special meeting of the
board last Saturday the super
visors affirmed the change made
by County Superintendent Pet
erson in the west boundary line
of the Holbrook school district.
For some years the location of
this line has been uncertain,
owing to incomplete records of cussed, aside from the transac
previous changes. In Order tó tion of routine business,
definitely fix the line Professor Mr. and Mrs. J. Frank Mat
Peterson decided to take the! thews. Mr. and Mrs. C. P.
necessary steps at this time, and
he accordingly established the j
west line two miles west of the
Holbrook townsite, which places j
it a little west of La Koux, wasn.
The action of the county super
intendent was ratified by the
board Saturday.
By the boundary lines now
regularly and legally established,
the Holbrook district has 22
miles of railroad within its boun
daries; St. Joseph has 10 miles
and Manila 4 miles.
Sheepherder Surrenders Himself
Last Saturday Max Cántaro,
a sheepherder who shot and ser
iously injured Antonio Martinez,
a companion herder, June 4 at
the camp of Frank Galsary &
Co., near Dry Lake in, this coun
ty, came into Holbrook and sur
rendered himself to. Undersheriff
Clemons.
The day after the shooting oc
curred Undersheriff Clemons
visited the scene; Cántaro had
disappeared and Mr. Clemons
decided that the best way to ef
fect his arrest was to create the
impression that the sheriff's
office would not make much ef
fort to find him, as he probably
shot Martinez in self defense
This the undersheriff did. and
the result of this diplomacy was
that Cántaro gave himself up to
the sheriff's office Saturday,
Cántaro will be given a pre
liminary examination before
Judge Boyer some time today.
Martinez has fully recovered
from his wounds and has left
the county. In the absence of
the prosecuting witness Contaro
may be discharged from custody.

In this issue of the News ap
pears for the first time the an
nouncement of the candidacy of
Fáy I. Gardner for reelection to
the office of county assessor of
Navajo county. Mr. Gardner is
now serving his first term as
assessor; during his first term he
has by diligent search succeeded
in adding nearly one-half million
dollars in property to the tax-
roll, thereby equalizing the bur-;
den of taxation upon every prop
erty owner in the county. For
with more property upon which
taxes are paid, the rate per hun
dred can be lowered. Mr. Gard
ner's idea is to give every one a
square deal; to see that every
taxpayer pays his just proportion
of taxes, and no more, and to see
that property is listed for taxa
tion in the proper school districts.
The friends of Mr. Gardner be
lieve that he Í3 entitled to re
nomination by the democrats in
the county, and to a reelection by
the voters in November.
