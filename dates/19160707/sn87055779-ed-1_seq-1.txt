International . Srrvi-e:
WASHINGTON. July 7. Renewal
of the reports from German sources
that the submarine campaign short

that Germany will stand by the
pledges already solemnly given no
matter what pressure is brought to
bear to have them violated.
'It is admitted, however, that a
very seriou disaster to the German
arms in connection with the "push

change in policy. Rut officials say
that such a contingency is at present
remote and cannot be considered.

EXPECT TO RAISE
Subscriptions to Guarantee
Great Celebration in Octob

The raising of a guarantee fund
for the St. Joseph county celebra
tion Oct. 4 and ." in this city of
Indiana's centennial of admission to
statehood and of South Bend's f.Oth
anniversary of incorporation as a
city will he undertaken next week.
How large a fund will be guaran
teed by the business interests of the
county is, of course, unknown hut
those upon whom the duty of creat
ing the fund rests hope business In
terests will respond with the greatest
liberality. The chairman of the fin
ance committee is I L. Dennis, who
is also a member of the directorate
of the association in charge of the
celebration.
"We ,vill besin next week to raise
a guarantee fund with which to fin
ance tho celebration." said .Mr. Den
nis to the News-Times tday." "Cn
der the plan we will present to the
business men we propose t create a
fund of not less than $20.ou0. If
the total of subscriptions does not
amount to L'O.CMob then all subscrip
tions will be void ami we will have
to start over to raise a fund of su h
amount as business interests ate
willing to give. . We are hoping,
however, that we will be able to
create the fund without difficulty,
and 1 ' elieve we will, judging fro-n
indications. One member of our
directorate is simply waiting to)
place several subscriptions on thet
list, prominent business men having'
authorised him to do so. One of-
these subscriptions is for f.'o'O. The
others ire for less, but not below
$100.
Ixixvts to liaise Fund Quickly.
"This appeals to me as a strong
indication of the spirit in which our
finance committee will be received,
especially as these several subscrip
tions are unsolicited. . At that rate
it is easily seen that we should raise
a fund of even more than '2KQ0
quickly. Forty business concerns
guaranteeing S ." 0 0 each would pro
vide the minimum, but we much
prefer t spread the guarantee fund
over the entire county, because we
want every business man to feel
that he is a part of the force hack
of the event, as he is, and to show
his interest in and loyalty to the
great state of Indiana. We do not
want anyone to subscribe a cent more
than he can afford, but we do desire
that ea:h person show the utmost
liberality.
"The guarantee fund is. I think.
