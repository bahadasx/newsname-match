H. A. Cole is now postmaster at l'nw
1'hvv. He assumed charge last WtdrifH
day moroiog, Pottmaatsr Wakeman's
four years of service expired on June 12,
and Mr. Cole should have had charge at
that tune as his appointment was con
tinued on the second day of June. The
important and critical allire of the na
tion at this time, however, have kept
Pratidaot Wilson's time fully occupied,
and postofTice commissions have lain on
his desk several weeks awaiting his sig
nature. M r. Cole's appoiutment is a popular
one. Hi has been a resident of Paw Paw
for upwards of 35 years. For over 80
years he was owner and publisher of the
Free Press Si Courier, which was the
only democratic paper in Van buren
county. He has always been active in
the councils of his party and is ai pres
ent secretary of the democratic county
committee. The postoffice comes as a
merited reward for services rendered his
party.
Tbe fact that Mr. Cole was the only
candidate or the appointment, and that
his petitions were universally signed b
both democrats and republicans is suf
flcent evidence of his standing in the
Community, and the popularity of his
selection as postmaster. He enters up
on his dutn s wiib the b- st w ishes of the
retiring postmaster and the public in
gaoaral.
K.x Postmaster Wakeman will now, as
soon as all his postollice reports are com
pleted, devote his entire time to The
Northerner. He wan the recipient of a
handsome thermos bottle, a gift from
the postal employees as a token of their
respect and esteem. To say that the
remembrance is appreciated by the re
cipient is putting it too mildly. He will
treasure it in the years to come, as a
memento of four pleasant jears spent in
association with the best postoffice force
in the United States.
GRAND OLD MAN HAS

William M. Thayer was born in Ql
wetfo County, New York, September 13,
V1. He died at his home in Paw Paw,
Michigan, .July 2, 1010; aged 83 years, 9
months and 19 dnys. In bis death Pw
Phw loses one of her oldest and most
honored citiz-ns. When about 8 year
of ajje, Mr. Thayer came with his par
ents from New York to Michigan and
settled at Grand Prairie, near Kalama
zoo. He lived in the vicinity of Paw
Paw the remainder of his life, except I
for about three years which he spent in
the West. In 18o2 he was seized with
that all pervasive gold fever, and he set !
out accordingly with a company of kin j
dred spirits across the plains and mount- j
ains for California. At Omaha their
conveyance gave out and they tramped
the remainder of the way on foot. He
remained in the gold fields of California
for about three years and was very euc
cesful in his quest after the glistening
treasure, but the loss of sight in one of
his ejea, through some nervous trouble,
caused him to return to his old Paw Paw
home. He lived here until his death.
Soon after bis return he was married
on November 7, 1855, to Miss Martha A.
Gilman, a young lady of one of the tine
old families in this part of the state. As
true pioneers, though not of the earliest
type of course, they set their faces for
ward and began the battle of life to
gether. After a few years their home
was blessed by the birth of a son, the
late E. G. Thaer. Mr. Thayer was al
ways a fearless and active man, possessed
of unusual energy and industry, and she
was a competent helpmate, a faithful
and industriotjs home maker. Earnest
ly and incessantly they labored side by
side, and it is given to but very few to
live together as long and to remain so
active to the end. In 1866 he took up i
the farm we.-t of town, then a tract of I
heavy timber land, and cleared away the i
virgio forests, transforming it into one
of the most fertile and productive farms j
in the country. For nearly 30 years he j
lived and labored on thi9 farm It was
his joy and reward to see it change under
the touch of his own hand from a prime- j
val wilderness into a garden spot, He !
left the farm in 1804 in charge of bis son
and wife, and he and Mrs. Thayer came
in to Paw Paw to spend their remaining
years. But his activity was unabatnL';
indeed the time of his inactivity inunt
be measured only in terms of months.
In 1900 the old folks came to this lovely I
home on the lake sho'e where they were J
joined thre? years later by his son and
wife.
Mr. Thayer was a man of the woods,
not merely as a farmer and clearer of j
the forests, but also as a hunter, trapper
and fisherman. He knew the life of the
woods and lakes and streams with an
intimacy known to but very few to dy
He lived in thiscountry when these now

year he followed the hunter's line as it
was gradually pushed back until it final

the Upper Peninsula. Yet even after he
was 81 he maN the trip and brought
back his portion of the game. Until the

We take pleasure in announcing the following
business change for the Tkue NORTHERNER The
plant is now owned by P. N. Wakeman and A. N.
Cole, equally. Mr. Cole is not a stranger here.
He was born here and learned the printing bus
iness in the Free Press and Courier plant owned
by his father, H. A. Cole, fur so many years. He
is thoroughly familiar with all branches of news
paper and job work, and will have the active
supervision of the mechanical end of the business.
Many improvements are planned, the first and
most important of which will be the installation of
a standard Linotype machine. The machine has
been ordered and will be installed at the earliest
possible date. This will add much to the efficiency
and capacity of the plant, and enable the new
owners to publish a tirst class newspaper. Our
job department will continue to be one of the im
portant features of the business. Our facilities
for all kinds of job printing will be second to no
office in Southwestern Michigan. There is no job
too large or none too small for us to handle
promptly and satisfactorily.
Both partners will devote their entire time to
the business The editorial policy of the paper
will be republican in politics, as in the years gone
by, and it is our intention to publish a newspaper
that will be a credit to Paw Paw and the county.
To this end we earnestly solicit the co-operation
and assistance of the public. We want the news
and all the news and want you to feel that you
have an interest in our business. Send in your
items or call us or the 'phone. If you have a job
for us and cannot come to the office, call us up and
we will come to you.
It will take some little time to make the con
templated changes and get everything in working
order, but our "stakes ate set" to make the True
NORTHERNER one of the best newspapers and most
valuable advertising mediums in southwestern
Michigan, and we shall work hard to merit the
assistance and co-operation necessary to accom
plish our purpose.
