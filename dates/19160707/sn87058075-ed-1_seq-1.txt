Crtm'i Celebration a Great Success.
The weather man favored Cresco with
an ideal day for its 50th anniversary
patriotic celebration and the town was
filled with one of therisrgest crowds
in its history, probably 10,000 people
having been entertained that day and
well entertained too, according to uni
versal comment. But best of all, in
spite of the large number present, not
an accident occurred to mar the pleas
ure of anyone and not an arrest was
made, and the- police had little to do
except to regulate traffic at the con
gested street corners in the business
section of the city.
The Calmar and Lime Springs bands
arrived early and at nine o'clock the
fast gathering crowds were entertained
with concerts by both bands.
Promptly at ten o'clock, the parade
moved from its assembling point on
Market Street, moving north and west
several blocks and returning to the
place of starting. Everywhere was
heard words of praise for the parade
which was one that would do credit to
a city of ten times the population of
Cresco, forty-seven societies and busi
ness enterprises being represented and
nearly everyone with a beautiful or
novel float. The order of parade was
as follows:
Head Marshal, M. J. McArthur, on
horseback.
Color bearer, John Coyle.

senting the states.

Bounding hayrack,
It was universally conceded that
among the many artistically decorated
floats, that the one representing the
Lomas Drug Store was the daintiest,
while the Peters ft Hardy float with its
miniature barn which was nearly com
pleted by its five or six workmen dur
ing the course of the parade, and the
revolving battle-ship constructed by L.
V. & R. A. Strayer chiefly out of the
various products of their tin shop were
the two most novel floats in the parade.
Of the societies, the Odd Fellows
were represented by three decorated
held together by the familiar three
links. The Modern Woodmen were
represented by a nice float and a line of
marching neighbors. The Woodmen of
the World presented their uniform drill
team, and a fine float emblematic of
their order, and with capital impersona
tions by A. R. Cornish and John F.
Murtha of George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln respectively, with
decorations to indicate the union of the
blue and the gray, alto a miniature log
cabin, indicative of the humble homes
of those great original "Woodmen"
and emblematic of the humble homes
of the great mass of W. O. W. mem
bers whose homes are protected by this
order. The auxiliaries of the above
orders were also represented.
Promptly at the scheduled hoar—and

PLUCK, PROGRESS, PERSEVERANCE AND PATRIOTISM IN POLITICS
by-the-way every part of the program
commenced exactly at the appointed
hour—Judge William Theophilas began
bis address which was listened to with
the closest attention by a large audi
ence who were anxious to see and hear
their former neighbor and friend. The
address was just what might be expect
ed from one of such attainments as are
possessed by the judge, and at the
earnest request of many who heard the
address and others who could not get
near enough to the platform to hear it,
the PLAIN DEALER will print practic
ally the whole address in our next issue.
Judge Theophilus, who was elected to
his first public office from this County,
is a candidate for Judge of the Supreme
Court and his many friends in this
County will doubtless see that he
receives a big, complimentary vote.
The free street attractions were fine.
The two people who put on the bound
ing hay rack act did a combination
horizontal bar and bounding net act
that was first class and the McGood
and Tate—two ladies and two gentle
men—gave an acrobatic act and the
feats of strength, that was decidedly
fine.
The base ball game attracted the big
gest crowd we ever saw in northeast
ern Iowa at a ball game, and every
one got his money's worth. Although
errors were numerous, they were so
well distributed that the game remain
ed close and exciting till the finish
when Waucoma won from Adams by
tieing the latter and then adding two
scores in a spectacular finish.
The fireworks display was good and
generous, it taking nearly an hour to
complete this part of' the program
which was given in the south side park
which proved an ideal spot for the dis
play. We doubt if our people had
realized till the 4th of the possibilities
and convenience of what is rapidly be
coming a beautiful little park with its
fountain, flower beds, trees and neat
little band stand.
Three dances and a merry-go-round
furnished plenty of amusement to com
plete the day's program.
Married.
July 1st, 1916, at the Methodist
parsonage, occurred themarriuge of A.
N. Wentworth, of Friona, Texas, and
Mrs. Laura Louise Miller, of Kansas
City, Rev. Kerwin officiating. Mr.
Wentworth is an old time resident of

but has lived for the past nine years in'
the Panhandle, Texas, coming here to
cclebrate the 50th anniversary of Cresco
as well as his own wedding. They will
visit with friends and relatives for two
months when they will return to their
home in Texas.

Demcntk County ConvestioB,
The democrats of Howard County
met in delegate convention last Satur
day morning and were called to order
by C. Foley,|who was selected as per
mant chairman of the convention, and
B. McAllister was selected as secretary.
A roll call of delegates showed a
majority of the townships represented
and an adjournment was taken until
1:30 p. m.
In the afternoon the convention met
persuant to adjournment and selected
the following delegates to the state
convention to be held at DesMoines on
July 12th.
C. T. McWilliams, of Chester.
L. E. Wentz, of Elma.
F. D. Mead, of Cresco.
Joseph Griffin, of Cresco.
James Kearns, of Riceville.
F. E. Howard, of Elma.
D. J. Ferrie, of Cresco.
Vacancies in the county ticket were
filled as follows:
Clerk of the Courts—James Cash
man, of Elma.
Recorder—Henry L. Herold, Cresco.
Coroner—Dr. C. D. Roome, of Cresco.
Attorney—John McCook, of Cresco.
Supervisor, Third District—John Nath
Sr., of Saratoga.
It is reported that McCook and per
haps others of the above will decline to
stand for election, in which case it is
optional to fill or leave vacancies at
the will of the county committee. It is
almost certain that the vacancy in the
First Supervisor district will be filled.
The precinct comitteemen met and
organized by the selection of C. Foley,
of Elma, as county chairman, and E.
D. McWilliams, of Chester, as secre
tary.

mitteemen, D. H. Thomas was re
elected county chairman.
Base Ball Next Sudsy.
Next Sunday, commencing at 2:30,
Cresco will play Lanesboro on the Matt
Flood grounds north of town. The
teams are evenly matched and a good
game may be expected.
The game last Sunday was somewhat
of a disappointment, the Elma team
being badly outclassed, being refeated
by Cresco by a score of 18 to 0.
Teat Program
The,tent meetings now in progress
one block east of the court house are
growing in interest, and if you have
not attended you are losing a valuable
opportunity to hear portions of the
Scripture lectured pn that are intensely
interesting.
Friends if you're out of the Christian
Life come and hear of the Way to
Heaven. If you know Him then we,
are together, regardless of church or(
belief, all working together for the
same place. Shall we not be friends?
You are invited to attend and enjoy
these meetings. As followers of Christ,
the question will not be what church
do we follow, but are we faithful to
the Master that the Judge will ask us
in the great day of judgment.
These meetings, though supported by
a denomination, will be conducted to
benefit all, as all converts are always
left to choose their church preference.
Moreover, no creed but the Bible will
be preached, nor will anything be said
derogatory to any other church or faith,
for we have the most profound respect
for all Christian people and faith, and
if you have heard otherwise let us say
you have heard wrongly. And further,
let us say that the program as follows
will be arranged so as to be continued

PAVLOWA
The incomparable, in "The Dumb
Girl of Portici."
Over 500 people, over 900 scenes.
The most lavish production ever filmed,
in nine parts.
The cast is practically a reproduction
of the dramatis personae of the oper*
"Masaniello" as it was given all over
the world a feneration ago, but then
all similarity ends. The wildest ima^i
nation of one who recalls the primitive
operatic production will not conceive
even the faintest idea of what genius
in filmcraft, a/id a woman at that, haa
accomplished within the confines of a
modern picture plant. "The Black
Crook" was the title ofjthe spectacle
presented in our theatres at the time
"Masaniello" was the rage. Neither
"TheJ Black Crook" nor Masaniello"
would do to-day. The only reason why
Pavlowa chose "Masaniello" as a
vehicle was because of the remarkable'
character of Fenella and because the
Russian celebrity is the only woman in
all the world who could portray the role
which has frightened more singers end
caused more of a furor in its day than
any mind of an author has ever con-,
ceived. It is as "Fenella" that Pav
Iowa will electrify the world.
