WAR IS UNLIKELY
Carranza Sends Note
ToU S.That May
Avoid Difficulty.
Washington, July 0.?Early re?
sumption of friendly diplomatic con?
versation with the do facto govern?
ment of Mexico to the end that peace
and order may be restored in' north?
ern Mexico and along the border is
expected here to be the next step of
the United States in its relations with
its southern neoighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M., and culmi?
nating in thee fight, at Carrizal, Mex?
ico, between American und Mexican
troops appeared tonig htto have been
dissipated by an amicable note from
General Carranza presented during
the day by Elisen Arredondo, ambas?
sador designate.
The note proposed that the differ?
ences between the governments he
tied by mediation or by direct ne?
gotiations It is remarkable for its
brevity, its restrained and friendly
tone and for the absolute lack of any ?
of the strong and even insolent lan- I
guage which characterized the last'
two notes from the de facto govern- .'
meat. It treats as n closed incident
the exchange of unfriendly communi?
cation which brought war almost
within sight.
No formal comment on the note was
obtainable from state department of
fk ials. A copy was forwarded to the
White House immediately upon its re?
ceipt and President Wilson will deter?
mine the course to be pursued. The
fact that Secretary Lansing completed
bis preparations today for a month's
vacation to begin Friday is leg;-tiled
as significant of a feeling on his part
that the crisis is over
As is matter of general principle the
Washington government always hns
favored mediation of any disput'J
sui'tihv for such procedure. There is
every indication, however, that in the
present instaiiceo it wil be deemed
desirable to conduct f? i thconiing ne?
gotiations idrectly with the Carranza
govei tnaent.
It is not known whether a formal
reply to General Carranza's note is
contemplated. Diplomatic usage does
not call for one and many officials
feel that more can be accomplished
through informal discussion between
Mr. Arredondo and Counselor Polk,
who will act as secretary in Mr.
Lansing's absence, than could be hop?
ed for in any other way.
State department officials appeared
entirely satisfied with the definition of
the matter to he settled outlined in
the new Mexican note. It is presented
in this language as translated at the
embassy:
"The American government believe
reasonably that the insecurity of its
frontier is a source of difficulty; and
the Mexican government on its part
Lciieves that the stay of American
troops on Mexican territory aside
from being a trespass on the sover?
eignty of Mexico is the immediate
cause of the conflicts. Therefore the
withdrawal of American troops on tho
one hand and the protection of the |
frontier on the other are the two es- |
sentinl problems, the solution of which
must be the directing object of the
efTorts of both governments."
Coupled with this definition is an
outline of a sort of military status quo
beyond the border which the de facto
government suggests as a substitute
for its previous demand for immed?
iate withdrawal of the American
troops. It is stated as follows:
"In the meantime," (pending me?
diation or direct negotiation) this
government proposes to employ all
efforts that may he at its disposal to
avoid recurrences of new incidents
which may complicate and aggravate
the situation. At the same time it
hopes the American government on
its part may make use of all efforts
to prevent also new acts of military
and civil authorities on the frontier
that might cause new complications."
While the object of the negotiations
is thus clearly outlined and appear
acceptable to the state department
the subjects lo be considered specifi
cally will have to be arranged later.
President Wilson has made it clear
that gradual withdrawal of the expe?
ditionary force wot'-l be ordered once
ii was tssurcd Carraiv-u forces would
be employed actively in breaking up
bnndil preparations for new raids.
Army officials believe there will be
complete withdrawal of the force us
rapidly ' as is possible without en?
dangering the border.
A plan for "border eontonements"
to which reference is made in the note
was proposed by General Obregon at
his conference in El Paso with Major
Genernl Scott, chief of staff of the
army. General Scott would not con?
sider it then because it was founded
on the stipulation that General Per
shing's column would be withdrawn
immediately. That stipulation in eff?
ect now is revoked and unquestion?
ably American officials now will give
the plan serious consideration.
Mobilization of the national guard
Clus
continued today at full speed. It is
certain there will be no immediate al?
teration in the war department plans.
Probably a reduction of the border
forces would be ordered only 'after
some co-operative plan of action had
been agreed upon.
Officials believe that the call for the
national guard and the actual dis?
patch of the troops to the border was
(the impelling influences which induc?
ed General Cnrranza to abandon the
hostile attitude taken in his previous
notes.
The Farewell Parade.
(Richard J. Beamish, in the Phila?
delphia Press.)
Brown as the dust from which they
sprang,
The boys of the guard marched yes
ter day.
The long parade swept through a lane
Of white-faced women and sad
eyed men.
"Hep!" said the captain?a groceer's
clerk,
And the banker's son kept step to the
word.
"By four!" and the long, lean khaki
legs,
Regrouped themselves, while the
boyish eyes ?
Shifted from side to side for a face
Sweetheart, mother, dud or chum,
The city paused awhile that its hoys
Might see how it cared. But the
khaki brain
Thought only of one or two or three,
Only these and a sun-baked plain,
Where cactus and sniper and Fate
may meet;
The khaki brain heard no rolling
drum,
As train of love song, a mother's
word,
And then perhaps a machine gun's
whir??
These were the only things it heard.
For death and life walked hand in
band
In the dust-brown ranks through the
white-faced lane,
And prayers were whispered in
hearty hearts,
"Dear God, send them safely hame
again."

PICTURE OF FIGHT
Vivid Account by the
Associated Press of
Battles in France.
The following statement fron? the
Associated Press correspondent on the
dring lines in France, gives a vivid
picture of the gigantic proportions of
the huge struggle recently begun be?
tween the massed armies of the Al?
lies and Germany:
Press Camp in France, July 3, via
London, July 4.? Facts and impres?
sions come in overwhelming numbers
lo the Associated Press correspondent
who is on the move morning and night
trying to grasp the details of the gi?
gantic struggle which is in progress
in northern France. At every turn he
realizes the immense forces of mater?
ial and men that are being employed
in this determined offensive.
Everywhere the eye can reach are 1
perspiring and dust-laden soldiers,
while on the side lines groups of peas?
ants call out to the passing soldiers
and the drivers of ammunition trains,
endlessly going and coming, for the
latest news. British and German
wounded are seen limping off the field
side by side, while processions of
Imch re-load shells and ambulances
deliver wounded at the dressing sta?
tions to he passed on lo waiting
(.rains.
Where the British and French linos
join there is another world of blue and
i haki uniforms and varied kinds of
ransporl vehicles. An automobile took
'.lie Associated Press correspondent to
lay In a point on the battlefield, which
week ago had been in sight and
range of the German machine gun?
nels. Reserves were sitting about
among the shell craters wrought by
the terrifllc lire of the British guns,
iormun rides were being gathered in
piles and German dead in rows for
burial. The correspondent was offered
captured German helmets on all hands
by the soldiers, German ollicers' re?
volvers, and even a pair of binocu?
lars.
CHANGE OF SCENES.
The change from the scenes pre?
sented by the monotonous trench war
e to those of an advancing army
was amazing. From the ruins of the
German positions between Montaubail
and Mametz the correspondent looked
over the whole field toward the second
great line of the German defenses,
.vhere the barbed wire entanglements
were plainly discernible; from the
lield won by the British with its but?
tle litter and silent shell holes the
spectator looked forward to where the
battle still raged and, west beyond
Fricourt, to where the british infan?
try were advancing to take another
position.
Men, whenever spoken to, talked of
"good luck" or "bad luck," which
meant that they had made the rush
across the zone between the old Bri?
tish and German lines against little
oppo-ition or that some machine guns
had been still in position and snipers
had survived the shell lire.
As an instance of the amazing rap?
idity with which the British troops
advanced, a British colonel took his
first real sleep since the light began
in a German dugout, where his pre?
decessors candle still burned on the
wall.

A RUBEE'S RAHDEN ERG.
Mr. .lohn P Cose told us some days
ago that he had found a certain kind
of egg in his hen-coop?a double
egg, two perfect eggs, one inside the
other. The editor refused to take any
notice of the story, and culled for
proof, following the regular estab?
lished order, and demanded that the
egg he produced, or a Statement from
Mrs. Rose. The egg was produced,
and true enough, there were two in
the same shell. The inside egg was
floating in the contents of the larger
egg. Further information on the egg
question was brought to the office
one day this week, by Miss Katrin.i
Cose, who stated that this same hen I
had laid two such eggs. Unfortunate?
ly, the said hen that laid these double
eggs could not be. identified, else
jtherc would be a great, demand, per
?haps, for Burke's Carden eggs from
the Rose poultry yard.
CORN GROWING SOME.
Here follows a statement by Mr.
.1. N. Harman: "At 7:15 o'clock, on
July 1st., 1 measured a stalk of corn
accurately, putting down a stake and
marking the height. Exactly 24 hours
later I measured the same stalk, and
it had grown 5 1-2 inches. This is -i
true statement."
Mr. Harman added, that he was wil?
ling to swear to the statement, know?
ing how reluctant one Taxcwcll man
is to believe any such statement mad"
by another Tazewell man, about his
garden, cow, or crop of any kind.
Some of these men say they wouldn't
believe many of them on oath. Mr.
Harman's corn is "growing some."
His name is likely to be presented
next Monday night as President of
the Ananias Club at its annual meet?
ing.
WON'T (JET IT BACK."
When this ofiice bought at one
whack about (20.00 worth of postage
stamps a few days ago, to be used
in mailing statements to subscribers
of this paper, some smart Aleck re?
marked: "Bet you don't get enough
back to pay for your stamps." So he
thought, but he didn't know quite as
much as he thought hi' did. Hj didn't
kno.v the character of she subscrib?
ers. V'os, we have gottn the postage
bill hack, all right, and then some.
The thanks of the Editors are hereby
extended to all those who responded,
and are still responding, and to those
who will, as the days go by. How?
ever, if our good friends had noticed
the date on the labels, we. could have
saved the postage bill and stationery
and several days work spent in send'
ing out the bills. We are not com?
plaining, and mention this only to
say, that the object of putting date of
expiration of subscription on the la?
bels was to save trouble and expense
lo both publisher and subscriber.
Again, we thank you. A number, not
large, ordered this paper stopped.
This they had a right to do. We regret
to lose a single subscriber, and hope
all of them will come back. Every
one of them will some day need just
such service or help as only their
county paper can give, and then they
will see their mistake in dropping
out. Again, with a broad smile, we
thank you. EDITORS.
