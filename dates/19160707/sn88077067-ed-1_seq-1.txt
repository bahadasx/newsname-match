LIVES
Of Two Boys Snuffed Out at
Ft. Recovery Sunday
Treacherous Curve on Cement
Roadway Scene of Collision
of Motor Cycles.
Clarence Unser, aged 23 years, son
of Mr. und Mrs. Julius Unser, of Dear
Tlllin and Puul Steinbrlck, aged 19
ye;us, sou of Mr. find Mrs. Albert
Stelnbi Ick, also of Tlllin were almoHt
Instantly killed IuhI Sunday evening
on the concrete road one mile went
of Ft. Recovery, when two motorcy
cles the boys were riding came to
gether in a head-on collision.
The two boys, together with two
other companions, Cletus Wangler
and Edward Wanzle, all of Tlflin bad
started out Sunday for a motor trip,
all on motorcycles. They had come
as far as Ft. Recovery without nits
hup. All the riders had started out
the concrete road above mentioned
and Steinbrlck bad a considerable
lead on the rest. A bend in the road
prevented the three riders to see
Steinbrlck, who bad turned the bend
quite a while before. After riding
a short distance, the Steinbrlck lad,
unking the others might have had
some trouble or turned back, turned
around and started back at a high
rate of speed. Near the sharp turn
in the road stands a large oak tree,
making It quite impossible for any
one to see an approaching machine.
Steinbrlck and the three other rid
ers arrived at the turn at the same
-. The former, being in a straight
line with Unser, the two machines
came together with teritllc force,
throwing both lads to the cement
road, both receiving crushed skulls.
Unser died five minutes after the ac
cident. Steinbrlck was still breath
ing when picked up and be was rush
ed to the ofllce of Dr. Lieser, at Ft.
Recovery. He never regained con-
scoiusness and died two hours after
being taken to Ft. Recovery.
The other members of the party es
caped serious injury. Wanzle was
thrown from his machine on a mud
bank and badly bruised while
Wangler jumped a ditch on the side
of the road and escaped injury.
The remains were taken to the
May undertaking establishment at
Ft. Recovery aha the parents of the
boys at once notified. The grief
stricken parents arrived early Mon
day morning to claim the remains
of the boys.
DOESN'T I'AYTO SPEED EVEN A
LITTLE
Leo Holer, of Lima, received a
fracture of the left collar bone and
was considerably bruised up last Sun
day afternoon when a motorcycle he
was riding hit some wet sand, throw
ing him from the machine.
The young man had brought at lit
tle cousin along on the machine to
this city for a fishing trip. An ep
proaching rain evidently made the
fellow speed up a bit. The little
cousin of the injured man luckily
escaped without a scratch.
AMI STILE ANOTHER ONE
Robert Stepjheusou, son of Mr. and
Mrs. Geo. Stephenson, of Hopewell
township, met with a peculiar yet
painful accident last Sunday after
noon. He was riding on the front
of a motorcycle and when the driver
turned at the union church the un
fortunate fellow in some manner had
his foot caught in the wire fence. His
ankle was dislocated

JOHN STILL AGITATING
MOTORIZATION
FOR
J. G. Romer, of Celina, made this
office a call Thursday, while here in
the interest of the project to run mo
tor cars on this branch of the C. H. &
D.. The plan Is to run three cars a
day t-ach way. The pilomotors of this
plan are very .presistent. We never
knew of the efforts of the many that
have been undertaken ti make u rail
road out of this said branch to con
tinue so long. This presistency may
accomplish something yet. it is an
injustice to our people It wil have to
bo admitted. We can not get out of
to.vn touth, and return the same day.
We submit that after all the people
did ir. the way of encouragement, fi
nancial and otherwise, such treat
ment would be the proper subject for
inquiry by the sttae authorities.
Yet, we are heartiny in favor of
this project. Mendon Herald.

MILLIONS FOR
GOOD ROADS
WASHINGTON, June 28. Under
the federal good roads bill, which
was finally agreed to in conference
form in the house today and there
fore is an accomplished piece of leg
islation, road buildinE should receive
a very decided impetus in the state
of Ohio.
There becomes available for road-
building purposes in Ohio during the
fiscal year beginning next Saturday
il93,70rt, which will be agumented
in each of the following fiscal years
in the following amounts:
1917-18, $387,401; 1918-19 $581,-
100; 1019-20, $77 1,800; 1920-21,
$968,500.
This makes a total of $2,905,500
to be paid out by the federal govern
ment for road building in Ohio dur
ing the five fiscal years beginning
July 1, next.
Must (iive Dollar for Hollar
As the state or local communities
must match the federal appropria
tions dollar for dollar, this means
that a total of $5,811,000 is made
available for the improvement of the
Ohio highways. Tho plans will all
be worked out under the state high
way department. The apportionment
is based on three factors- area, pop
ulation and number of rural delivery
and star routes. On a basis of all
three factors, Ohio will receive 3.874
per cent of the total appropriations
which are $5,000,000 for the first
year, $10,000,000 for the second
year, $15,000,000 for the third year,
$20,000,000 for the fourth year and
$25,000,000 for the fifth year.

As yet the mtor truck does not ap
pear to foreshadow the retirement of
the horse, declares a writer in the
Providence Journal. On the con
trary, the market prices in Boston in
dicate that the horse is more than
holding his own against the new com
petition The local demand for hor
ses is greater than it was a year ago
and higher prices are predicted.
The steam locomotive, the electric
motor, and the bicycle never drove
the horse off the roads. Automobiles
to the number of hundreds pf thous
ands are in daily use and there is no
lack of work for the horse. The ad
vantages of heavy motor trucks have
been proved, and yet more horses
than ever are in demand. The ex
planation is that as there is enough
hauling for all classes of vehicles and
that under certain conditions the

up the profits of your poultry flock
when a few cents worth of home
made lice powder will free all fowls,
says M. C. KipatricK, poultry expert
of the. Agricultural Colege Extension
Service, Ohio State University. An
effective home-made lice powder is

of plaster-paris in a pan. Then stir
in 3-4 pin of gavoline and 1-4 pint
of cresol or 95 per cent crude car
bolic acid until a crumbly powder is
formed. Dust the fowls by sifting
tjie powder in the feathers, between

W'e have heard much about the
poisonous nicotine in tobacco. Here
is a story told us by an acquaintance
who witnessed Ihe experiment a few
days ago In a distant city. An em
ployee? ill a factory found a garter
snake near the factory. He took the
snake into the presence of his fellow
employes and taking a broom with
drew therfroiii a splint. Next he got
a pipe used by one of his associates
and pushed the broom straw back
and forth through the much used
pipe r.em until there wus a good
coaling of nicotine on the straw. He
placed the straw within reach of the
snake's tongue and when It waggled
that member outward in a threaten
in,; manner it came in contact with it
W'i'hin two minutes after the reptile
hiul licked the nicotine on tho splint
his snakeslilp was dead. Cadiz Dem
