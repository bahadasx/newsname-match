STATE CAMPAIGN DREW |

Large Sized Crowd Also at Lexington.
Former Governor Blease the Fa- j
vorite at Both Meetings?What
They Are Discussing. I
I
Special to The Herald and News.
Columbia, July 6.?The State campaign
meeting in Columbia Tuesday
was in some measure representative
of the State at large, though a good
nrrmortion of the voters of this coun
ty were present. Tuesday being the j
Fourth of July, and the National
Guard "being encamped here, the political
speaking drew people from every
- section of the State. The theatre,
where the meeting was held, was taxed
to its capacity. The crowd was banked
back to the entrance doors, and all j
the aisles were filled. There was no !
question that former Governor Blease

though he was the first of the gubernatorial
candidates on the program, a
good many of the crowd left when hi3
address was concluded. Botii Governor
Wanning and Solicitor Cooper had j
? a good following in the audience also. |
(At -Lexington on Wednesday, a here j
there was another large crowd, former
Governor Blease was again the un- i
* doubted favorite. There was some j
applause for both Governor Manning i
x and Solicitor Cooper, but the real enthusiasm
was for the former governor.
At the Columbia meeting Governor
Blease was presented with a great
mass of flowers, and Governor Manning
received several bouquets. At
{Lexington Governor Manning and So
licitor Cooper both got flowers and
peaches, while Governor Blease received
flowers and a fine, large fish.
The campaign party will be in Saluda
today, Edgefield tomorrow and
will go to 'Aiken on Saturday. There
will then be an intermission of tea
days, after which the campaign will
open up again at Barnwell.
Is Factionalism Deid?

Governor Blease, in reply to the plea ,

of Governor Manning for an end of !
"factionalism." made at various meet- !

was a political friend of imne. The
letter to the Attorney General is as
follows:
"Columbia, Jan. 21, 1915.
"*Hon. Thomas H. Peeples, Atty. Gen.,
"Columbia, S. C.
"Dear Sir:
J
"As I have said to you heretofore,
1 was elected to the office of Governor
i^)on a platform in opposition to the 1
/ policies which have prevailed in this
State for the last four years, and it
is therefore desirable that your assistant
should be a man in sympathy
-with my policies. You have seen nt
' to appoint Mr. Fred. H. Dominick your
assistant, who was a supporter of the
policies of my predecessor in this
j office. y
"In these circumstances I do not
feel that 1 can rely upon your office
for legal advice. 1 shall need legal
advice in the administration of my
office, and therefore shall be com
x pelled to call this matter to the attention
of the legislature for such action
as they may see fit to take, if ydu
insist in making this appointment.
"Please let me have your reply.
' Richd. I. Manning Governor."
"Within the next few days, in keeping
(?) with his promise made on the
State House steps, lie committed the
following acts, and in the places mode
Ta/>ant hv the removal of friends of
mine, he not only selected his own
friends and supporters, but appointed
the very bitterest enemies of mine
H that he could possibly find. He could
ff not find enough work-days to effect
these removals, and the board of regents
of the State Hospital appointed
i
L
by me were removed in the early
hours of a Sabbath morning.

from his position with the
Sinking Fund Commission?an exConfederate
soldier, who had served j
the State faithfully all his life?and j
the appointment in his place of the j
son of Alan Johnstone of Newberry.
"These are only a few of the many
partisan acts which he has committed.
And in the appointments to fill the
newly created offices he chose not j
only his friends, but jaay bitter enemies,
as wil be shown by the men on
the?
1. Tax commission.
2. Board of charities and corrections.
"3. Board of conciliation.
"4. Beard of accountants.
"5. Assistant bank examiner.
'6. Board of review.
"And all others?not a Blease or
anti-Manning man appointed to any
}
place."
Governor Blease, in speaking of the
encampment at Sty*, said that if his
policy had been carried out South.
Carolina would today have had a brigade
which would have gone into the
service as a unit, instead of only, two
regiments winch would have to be
attached to brigades from other
States, and instead of going in under
some foreign brigadier general they
would have gone in under Brigadier
General Wilie Jones, who had been
. i
j retired by Governor Manning.
He said the administration of Gov- j
! ernor Wanning had been extravaagnt, j
and characterized the extra compen- I
sation paid by the governor to the!
superintendent of the asylum as a.
"conscience fund." saying he had the-:
record where Governor Manning reJ
turned 344 acres of improved farming j
lands in Clarendon county, with:
buildings thereon, and one lot, at two '
thousand and twenty dollars, and that |
if Governor Manning would pay tha J
State all the back taxes he owed he |
could pay several more notes.
The Columbia State thus reports
the speeches of Messrs. Cooper and
Manning:
Both Denounce Circular.
"The only feature of the meeting
was the statement by R. A. Cooper
relative to a circular issued in the J
up-country which he said characterized
him as a "thorn in the flesh for j
running tms year. Mr. -tooper saia
he was in the race because he wanted
to be governor and was running on
"his merits and authorized everybody j
who had talked with, him relative to!
his entering the race or had corresponded
with him about the matter to
make everything public. He will go
into the office untrammelled and without
any promises to any man, interest
or set of men, he said, should he be
elected governor.
"The circular referred to by Mr.
Cooper drew this statement from
Governor Manning, which he said
when beginning his speech:
"I have been informed that a circular
has been printed and circulated
in some of the counties presumably
in the interest of my candidacy. I
understand that this circular links up
two of my opponents as in a combina-!
tion to defeat me for reelection. This
circular is without authority from me I
or from my office. I did not know
that it had been printed, nor h^ve I
authorized same. I shall make this |
fight in a fair and square manner
with all my dealings open and above j
board. I shall not stoop to personalities
or underhand attacks, nor will
I allow such to be done with, my au-1
thority or knowledge.
"My official record is before you, j
anr! nr> that rernrri T stand T am a 1
candidate on my own merits and not j
on the demerits of my opponents."
"R. A. Cooper said he was standing j
on his own merits. >He outlined thi ;
things he thought should be accomplished.
He stood for an impartial
enforcement of law, for the adminis- j
tration of justice, for the warehouse '
system as a business institution, and j
for "an educational system without
any factions."
In further giving the address of!
i
Governor Manning, the State says:
<4The chief executive referred to his
first act in restoring the National
Guard after it had been disbanded as
a whole by a former governor. He
referred feelingly to his and his wife's ;
own gift of three of their sons to the j
South Carolina contingent of troops. !
"The governor referred to his cam- j
paign for law enforcement, particu- i
larly in Charleston, where liquor is i
no longer openly sold and a favorablo
sentoment for law enforcement has
been created. He spoke of reductions
in interest on money borrowed by the
State, of the cancellation of the Federal
debt on account of loss in propoftir
o n rl an lnnmont Krr tho VoHnnal
V/I Cjr HilU H ijk/JlliVli W Kf * tllV/ ? lUbtv/iiiAi
Guard before he same into office, the
laws in the interest of textile workers
passed during his administration and
educational and other progressive
legislation. Gov. Manning also reviewed
the asylum situation."
Blease at Lexington.
Over at Lexington former Governor
Blease characterized the administration
of Gov. iManning as the most lawless
since Reconstruction, referring
to seven riots, fourteen white men assaulted
by negroes, and eighteen
white women criminally assaulted by
negroes.
There were issues in the campaign,
he said, which were larger than men,
and the people should decide what
candidate represented the principles

six per cent, legal interest, the development
of the 'State Warehouse
system, rural credits with long-time
loans conducive to home owning. He
said the people were paying too much
taxes, and that too many entirely useless
offices had been created to give
people jobs. He said that now they
were spending $300,000 to make improvements
at the Asylum, and yet he j
had been condemned for demanding j
improved conditions there. He referred
to the $.",0,000 appropriated by
the last legislature, which would ha'-e
to be paid by the next, as a "campaign
fund for the present governor'
| to employ constables to do nothing
but go around in the campaign and
work for him.
Governor Manning said that so far
he had spent only $10,000 of the $50,000,
and $4,000 of this was spent before
the appropriation, but that he
would use ot all if he felt that conditions
demanded it. He said there had
been more convictions in the past
year tnan during tne year preceding,
and with fewer pardons there was a
better observance of law. He said
that he stood on his record. As in the
Columbia speech, he referred to low
interest at which the State had been
able to borrow money, and to the refunding
of the State debt at four per
cent, instead of four and one-half

NEWS OF POM ARIA. I
Large Crowd Expected at Jolly Street.
Anxious to Hear the Candidates.
Other News.
Pomaria, July .?The barbecue given
here Tuesday by the School Improvement
association was a most excellent
one. A large crowd was present, the
grounds were in full bloom with can
didates for the various offices. The
Hon. Henry C. Tillman of Greenwood,
candidate for Congress from the Third
district, was present and delivered a
most excellent address. The rain in
the afternoon interfered with the ball
game which had promised to be a
very interesting one. They were
forced to call the game off in the
fourth inning, the score then standing
three to one in favor of Pomaria.
It is expected that a k|:ge crowd
will attend the barbecue at Jolly
Street Friday of this week, the same
being the day of the opening of the
County Campaign. Everybody will
want to hear the candidates' platforms
at tlie beginning. Jolly Street
is the home box of Mr. W. B. Boinest,
candidate for the House. It was
through his efforts that the graded
school there, now known as Hunter- ,
DeWalt, was established. There will
be an interesting game of baseball in .
the afternoon between Swilton and,
Jolly Street teams.

A horse belonging to 'Mr. Adam L.
Aull and being plowed by one of his
darkies, became frightened a few
days ago, from a keen clap of thunder
which caused him to run away with
the plow stock, cutting one leg almost i
off. It was thought best at first to kill j
th worse. He later decided to treat
him for a while with the hope that
he might get him over it to a certain
extent. This was his fine driving
horse.
;Mrs. Francis 'Minick died at her
home near here Friday night and was
buried Saturday at St. John's church.
She was about 70 years of age and had

FIRST CHIEFS REPLY
SETTLES DIFFICULTY
Conciliatory Answer from Carranza
Closes Incident?To Continue
Negotiations.
Washington, July 5.?Early resumption
of friendly diplomatic conversations
with the de facto government
of Mexico to the end that peace and
order may be restored in Northern
Mexico and along the border is expected
here to be the next step of the
United States in its relations with its
Southern neighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M., and culminating
in the fight at Carrizal between
.American and Mexican troops, appeared
tonight to have been dissipated
by an amicable note from Gen.
Carranza presented today by his
ambassador designate here, Eliceo
Arredondo.
The note proposes that the differences
between the governments be
settled by mediation or by direct negotiation.
It is remarkable for its
brevity, its restrained and friendly
tone and for the absolute lack of any
of the strong, even insolent language
which characterized the last two communications
from the de facto government.
It treats as a closed incident
the exchange of unfriendly communi- -v
cations which brought war almost
within sight.
Up to Wilson Now. i
No formal comment on the noto
was obtainable from state department
officials. A capy was forwarded to the
White House immediately upon its receipt
and President 'Wilson will determine
the course to be pursued.
The fact that Secretary Lansing completed
preparations today for a
month's vacation to begin Friday is %
regarded as significant, however, of a
feeling on his part that the crisis i3 v;
over.
f . As
a matter of general DrinciDle
the Washington government alwaysfavored
mediation of any dispute
suitable for such, procedure.
There is every indication, however,
that in the present instance it will be
deemed desira'ble to conduct forthcoming
negotiations directlv with the
? \
Larranza government.

of the asylum and mentioned
the perquisites that the superintendent

saving in money. We do not say these
zro not necessary, but if they
are still there and an additional hign
salaried man why try to leave the impression
that there has been a saving
from these sources by increasing the
pay of the superintendent who lives
in his own home in the city.
