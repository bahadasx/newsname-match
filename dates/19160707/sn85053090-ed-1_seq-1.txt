Fallon County
Democratic Platform
BE IT RESOLVED, the that
democratic central committee
of Fallon County, Montana duly
assembled this 28th day of
June, 1916, hereby endorses the
last Democratic national and
state platforms, and especially
do we endorse the magnificent
record of Woodrow Wilson, Pres
ident of the United States, who,
together with the aid and sup
port of a Democratic congress,
has carried out, without fear or
t'avor, the pledges of the party,
has brought about great and last
ing reforms with as little busi
ness disturbance as possible, has
broken the power of Wall Street
and set a nation free from the
bondage, fostered under years of
Republican mis-rule, of capital
control, and has above all, safely
piloted his country through the
maestrom of the great European
conflict, where intervention
would have brought all the hor
ors of war, seated
— death at the
| American fireside and destroyed
I forever the era of prosperity with
I wl l ich H» 8 nation is now blessed,
President Wilson, standing up
on immutable foundations of
Democracy and true American
ism, has with consumate skill di
rected the force of civilization,
not with arms, but with reason
and moral pressure, against the
excesses of a war crazed world.
We earnestly solicit in Fallon
County a united endorsement of
our president and the support of
our national and state tickets.
In county affairs we advocate
a policy of economy and extreme
caution in the expenitures of
public funds and an administa
tion looking toward the conserv
ation and development of our
natural resources.
We would reccomend that in
all communities in the county
where possible that Wilson clubs
be organized and operate under
the direction of the democratic
county central committee,
We believe that the happiness,
icomfort and prosperity of the
rural districts, the up-building of
our towns, and the development
of the county as a whole, is largc
ly dependent upon a good system
of roads and we reccomend an
equitable and practical distribu
tion of road funds in all parts
of Fallon County.
We endorse the administration
of the present democratic officers
of talion County for their capa
ble service on behalf of the peo
pie and bespeak the support of
the voters for all democratic nom
inees in the county at the coming
general election, believing that
the sound, sane and efficient
i
I
j
:
principles as exemplified by the
four years of constrictive Demo
cratic legislation in national af
fairs, as applied to the manage
ment and direction of county
matters, will go far towards
developing natural resources and
hastening the coming era of pros
perity and plenty that is surely
in store for us. It is our further
belief and advice that a continu
ance of Democratic control of
matters political and financial
throughout the nation will hasten
and assure contemplated railroad
construction and investment of
outside capital in Fallon County.
Respectfully Submitted,

The registration books for the
primary election to be held on
August 29, 1916 will close July
29th, 1916. If you have not regis
tered do so today. If you have
changed your residence since the
last general election, that of 1914,
you must re-register for the pre
cinct in which you now live or
intend to vote on election day.
Many in Ekalaka, on account of
the precinct line dividing the
north and south part of town are
not registered at present in their
proper precincts. Look up your
name and then act so that your
vote will be accepted. If you
did not vote in the 1914 general
election your name has been
struck off.
Camp Crook people celebrated
last Thursday and Friday with a
program of ball games, broncho
riding and dancing. Elliott's or
chestra from here furnished the
music for the hop Thursday eve
ning. Those who attended had
a most enjoyable time and had
the pleasure ofjseeing the famous
"Tipperary" bronch rode which
was accomplished by Ruf us Rol
lin. Many of those who were
familiar with the fact that Camp
Crook was going to enter the dry
list on Friday evening expected
to witness, a general "souse"
i party,(but were sadly disapointed.
I The funeral of old John Barley
j corn in Camp Crook may or may
: not have been for the best but
time will teli.
And the wind she blew—this
being Wednesday evening. 11
tried to rain in town, but nothing
doing. South of us in the Box
Elder valley they had a nice rain.
At Baker the wind went into
high speed and the result was a
number of wrecked houses and
barns, a large number of win
dows blown out, a few people in
jured and the roof of the hospi
tal taken off, being in reality a
miniature cyclone. Other places
throughout the county suffered
slightly from the storm.
Good Show Coming
"THE UNWRITTEN LAW" which
is to be shown at the Play House
July 20th suggests the sensational
type of photodrama. It is sensa
tional but the same time free
from any taint of cheap sensa
tionalism.
There is a fight, a personal en
counter between the hero and the
villian, and this scene is plenti
fully provided with "punch"
There is a lurid fire endanger
ing the lives of a young mother
and her precious baby, while the
husband lying in the stuper of
alcohol is nearly devoured by the
flames.
A wedding and a murder, a
night in the "family room" of a
sordid resort, and brilliant cab
aret scenes.
Finally, there is the court-room
scene, flawlessly presented in
which the issues of the far-reach
ing plot are brought out a logi
cal and happy conclusion.
These are some of the features
that are presented in the most
realistic pictures in which the
talented emotional actress Bea
triz Michelena has yet appeared.

T. R. THEN AND NOW
Progressives Leaders Surrend
er to The Old Guard
Speaking at a dinner tendered
by National Progressive on the
eve of his departure for South
America, October 3, 1913, his
"farewell address" Col. Roose
velt declared:
"The party is solid, and it is
the firm determination of the
rank and file, no less than the
leaders, to preserve its political
entity, its solidity and integrity."
Men and women, I would
continue the fight even if I stood
entirely alone. I shall continue
it with a glad and proud heart
because it is made in your com
pany."
"Win or lose, whatever the
outcome, I am with you, and I
am for this cause to fight to the
end. We are dedicated in this
great war for righteousness, and
while life lasts we can not and
will not abandon it."
"The men who believe that we
will ever betray these ideals or
abandon the task to which we
have set ourselves'do not know
us and can not ever guess at the
faith that inspires us,"
This movement will never go
back, and whatever may betide
in the future, of one thing the
disciples of an easy opportunism
may rest assured—I will never
abandon the principles to which
we Progressives have pledged
ourselves, and I will never aban
don the men and women who
drew around me to battle for
those principles."
In his message declining the
Progressive nomination, Col T
Roosevelt in 1916 declared:
"Our loyalty is to the fact
not merely to the name, and
least of all to the party name."
"Yet it has become entirely
evident that the people under ex
isting conditions are not prepared
to accept a new partv. "
"The Progressive national or
ganization no longer offers the
means whereby we can make
these convictions effective in our
national life. Under such cir
cumstances our duty is to do the
best we can. and not to sulk be
cause our leadership is rejected."
"Under existing conditions the
nomination of a third ticket would
in my judgment, be merely a
move in the interest of the elec
tion of Mr. Wilson. - I shall there
for e strongly support Mr.
Hughes.—I can not accept the
nomination of a third ticket."
"Without ano regard to what
the personal feelings of any of
us may be as regards the action
of the Republican convention, I
wish very solemnly to ask the
representatives of the Progress
ive party to consider at this I time
only the welfare of the people of
the United States."
"I earnestly bespeak from my
fellow Progressives their u n
grudging support of M r.
Hughes."
