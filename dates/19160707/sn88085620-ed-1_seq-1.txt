Exploiters Blamed
for Mexico's Troubles
New York. —Carlos Lovelra and
| Baltasar Pages, representatives of
Yucatan (Mexico) organized workers,
have arrived in this city and have
made public an appeal to American
workers for peace between Mexico
and the United States signed by of
ficers of the following Yucatan
unions:
Electricians, carpenters, seamen,
bakers, masons, hotel and restaurant
clerks and cooks, commercial clerks,
smeltermen, hackmen, railroad men
and machinists, blacksmiths and boiler
makers.
Next week the Mexicans will visit
Washington and present a copy of the
proclamation to President Gompers —
who is now in the middle West —and
also discuss with the A. F. of L. ex
ecutive his proposal that a conference
be held at El Paso, Texas, between
representatives of the American Fed
eration of Labor and the Mexican
trade union movement.
The proclamation signed by the
Mexican unionists is a stirring appeal
for fraternity and peace between the
two countries.
"Until the day on which our social
revolution broke out," says this
I spirited document, "Mexico was, de

"In shops, mines and manufacturing

every corner of the same 'villas' and
palaces that gave the capital of the
republic universal renown.

Company struck to enforce better
working conditions and shorter hours.

was arranged and the company agreed
that a 4 per cent wage increase would

work now in the yard is completed.
All strikers will return to their
former positions and the company

torial policy, in this respect, to drive
the poor people to the great 'ha
ciendas,' great mine and factory re
gions, where they could be more easily
controlled by the 'rurales' and the
soldiers, instead of allowing them to
go to school and get an education to
become real citizens deserving of such
a title.
"Workingmen in Mexico were killed
if they attempted to unionize or to
strike; the peasants were slaughtered
in order to secure their property; the 1
Yaqui Indians were deported or sold
into slavery in Yucatan, so that the
great land owners of the State of So
nora could sell their lands to American
syndicates. Anybody who protested,
orally or in writing, was thrown into
jail, where imprisonment was worse
than death.
"We want to say, very frankly, to
Ihe American toilers that the Mexican
people do not hate the real American
people, the people who still have in
their heart the principles of Washing
ton and Franklin; we do not have
any hostile sentiment of any kind
against you, American laborers. In the
United States we only hate the mo
nopolists, the great oil and railroad
kings, all those who have utilized the
richness of our land for their personal
benefit; impudently stealing from us
the fruits of our labor; the same as
they do with you in your country,
those very same compatriots of yours,
whose only interests are their bank
accounts, having no love of country,
honor, or your ideas of life.
"Be on your guard, workers of the
United States. The Colrtmbus raid,
all of the anti-Mexican agitation of
the mercenary press of North Amer
ica, all the meetings, lectures and
publications of our foes in the great
American cities, are only for the pur
pose of drowning in blood the desires
of a brother people who have had the
courage and the strength; to rebel
against their oppressors, of giving
the workers of the world an example
of the only social revolution that
honestly deserves such a name.
"Be on watch, North American com
rades. Do not allow any one to fool
you with the lies of those who, as
long as they can make money, do not
care very much about the killing of
thousands of laborers. Help us to
secure that, once and forever, the
United States troops be recalled,
avoiding the great danger that there
is and must be while a khaki uniform
remains in Mexican territory."
PAINTERS REJECT OFFER
Johnstown, Pa. — The Painters'
Union has rejected their employers'
offer to return to work on a basis of
eight hours for eight hours' pay.
These workers are striking for eight
hours with no wage reduction. They
suspended work a month ago, and a
large number of non-unionists have
joined with them.
Brewery workers have organized all ;
plants in this city but one—the i
Geoner Brewing Company. The Bar
tenders' Union is cooperating with i
the brewery workers to make Johns- |
town 100 per cent organized in this i
industry.
EASTERN UNIONISTS UNITE
Boston.—At a meeting of delegates
of the various state branches and cen
tral labor bodies in this city, a New
England State Federation of Labor
was organized, permanent officers
elected and a constitution and by-laws
adopted. The eight-hour day was fa
vored and Edward S. Alden, of Hol

Shingle weavers
Have Rousing
Meeting i
Despite the inclement weather, the
| weavers turned out in full force to
mass meeting held at the Labor
Temple last Sunday.
Brother J. G. Brown, international
president of the union, made the
opening address and stated that indi
cations from all parts pointed to a
complete victory for the weavers all
Jdown the line.
It was announced that Bloedel
■ Donovan Co. at Bellingham, one of
the largest mill owners in the slate,
'was starting with a full union crew,
paying the scale. Several other mills
in different parts were also com
|mencing operations under union con
ditions.
Brother Swenson of the Typo's
(from Spokane was present and gave
la very interesting talk on the need
for solidarity of purpose and spirit
amongst union men. Among other
[things Brother Swenson, in referring
to Colonel Hartley's stand on union
; ism, said: "This is the man who in
[the last legislature fathered a bill to
I compel innocent children to salute
the flag in the public schools. No
wonder it requires force to make the
people patriotic with men like Hart
ley in our legislative bodies.'' Brother
Swenson has been on labor's firing
line for a good many years. He is a
consistent advocate of working class
solidarity and believes in the use of
the ballot as an effective weapon in
the industrial emancipation of the
working class, our class.
Brother Marsh also spoke a few
( words about the remarkable showing
of the weavers, stating that when the
strike was called things looked un
, certain, but to a man all the weavers
I went out and are organized 100 per
cent and today are more enthused and
.their ranks more solid than when the
strike was called. The workers are
realizing the power of solidarity.

Question —A declares that the de
termining factor in the price of a com
modity is the law of supply and de
mand. B claims otherwise. Who is
correct, and why?
Answer —A is right. The law of
supply and demand determines the
price, but not the value. In Vol. I,
Marx's "Capital/ this is fully dis
cussed.
NEWS AND VIEWS
STETSON STRIKE IS OVER
Philadelphia.—Although the strike
at the Stetson Hat Company is over,
this arrogant $8,000,000 corporation
I has been taught several lessons by its
workers who were forced on strike,
although unorganized. These work
ers, for the first time, have sensed the
power of solidity and the company's
promises indicate that it realizes the
old days have passed forever.
One of the gains secured is the
abolishment of gas complained of by i
strikers. The company manufactured
its own gas and used it in the process
of making hat s. Employes were often
forced to go to hospitals and lose
days of work because of this gas. The
percentage system will be adjusted,
and the company agrees*to hear the
grievances of its employes.
Many of the strikers have secured
other employment and declare they
will never be knoyvn as Stetson em
ployes until this concern accords its
workers the right to bargain col
lectively and until it is forced to
abandon, through the power of trade
unionism, working conditions that are
not indorsed by thinking men and
women.

LOW WAGES A BARRIER
TO PERFECT HEALTH
Detroit, Mich. —At the annual meet
ring of the American Medical Associa
|tion, Surgeon General Blue, United
States public health service, said that
the lower paid workmen were not re
ceiving sufficient wage to permit the
necessarily higher plane of living and
surroundings demanded for perfect
health and hygienic conditions. He
declared that he losses of the eco
nomic world through disease were be
ing recognized more and more, and
that the physician found poverty, ig
norance, intemperance and greed his
greatest enemies. Medical education
of the public is beginning to have its
effect, but a great struggle is still
ahead before the public generally
would accept all that was required, he
said.
Government establishment of model
counties and the upbuilding of sani
tary towns, In which hygiene should
rule supreme and form a model for
other communities when the good re
sults of public health became ap
parent, was advocated by Assistant
Surgeon General Rucker, of the public
health service.
Speaking on insanity, Dr. Richard
H. Hutchins, of Ogdensburg, superin
tendent of the New York state hos
pital, said the reports of the great
increase in insanity, due to the "high
tension" of American life of today,
was a myth. He said that 25 years
of observation had convinced him
that "if there is any increase in in
sanity among Americans it is very
small, and that the greater proportion
of insanity is found among foreign
born residents." The speaker declared
tw.it insanity is not hereditary in the
true sense of the word, as has long
been the belief, and that it is subject
to preventative measures, just as
tuberculosis is.
Dr. Helen Sumner of the children's
bureau, federal department of labor,
urged that physicians demand scien
tific data on child labor.
"We talk of preparedness," she said,
"but the greatest preparedness will be
to see to it that we raise healthy
normal citizens. generation after
generation, who will be able to pass
the army examination if needed by
their country."

WHY MACHINISTS STRUCK
Hamilton, Ohio. —Machinists em
ployed at the Black & Clawson shop
struck because their shop committee
man was discharged. With a loud
flourish the company announced that
the machinist was discharged because
he "shirked on the job." The ma
chinists replied that if the time sheets
of the company would sustain this
position the strike would be called
off immediately.
The machinists are still out.

MEYER LONDON TOLD CONGRESS
Meyer London, the New York so
cialist representative, lifted a lone
voice of protest in congress when a
resolution was presented granting the
president power to draft the entire
militia into the federal service. And!
Meyer London cast one vote of the
two votes against the proposition.
London told the congressmen some
plain, blunt truths, spoken in the
name of a party which cast almost
1,000,000 votes in the last election.
He said:
"Mr. Speaker, one cannot say very
much in three minutes, and there is a
great deal to be said here. I do not
like some of the arguments that have
been advanced upon the republican
side. It seems that they are playing
politics. There are men who would
play politics at the grave of a brother.

not for him to criticise. The real
question before congress at this mo
ment is, Shall the army of the United
States be sent to protect the border
of the United States or shall it be
permitted to invade the territory of!
Mexico?
"The right to use the national guard
must be restricted to the territory of
the United States. That's the only
way to save the country from war.
Protect your own border, and with
draw the army from Mexico.
"There is no dishonor in withdraw
ing from Mexico. You are a hundred
million strong. Mexico is distracted.
Writhing in the agony of revolution,
small, miserable, helpless.
"No one will doubt that you are
powerful enough to defeat Mexico: ■

Stronger army: you are not withdraw

not retreating because you are afraid;
but you do retire from Mexican soil j

PRIVATE OWNERSHIP
One group does the work and
starves, the other with properly has
the leisure. This is privilege, plu
tocracy. It exists in Milwaukee and
in every industrial center in the
United States. Those who work are
penalized because they work: those
who own are rewarded because they
control the resources and the means
of production.
Private ownership puts it in the
power of the owner to pay dying
wages and charge monopoly prices.

because you are afraid to commit a

mit that to be afraid to do a wrong,
to be afraid to commit an injustice, is
not cowardly, but a manly thing.
"There is no glory in licking a

capital.
"The American people are not
seeking either revenge or ac
quisition of Mexican territory.
The American investor has no

Mexican people themselves. He
has chosen to invest American

Europe. Shall all these hopes be
blasted?
"If you once enter Mexico, you
will never withdraw from it with
out appropriating a large slice of
Mexico. The same influences that
have forced the Villa outrage and
then the blundering Villa expedi
tion will force the retention of the
invaded Mexican territory, all, of
course, in the name of American
dignity, and as compensation for
i the blood which the American
people will pour cv%.

AWARD TO RUPTURED
WORKER
Ilarrisburg. Pa.—The stale work
men's compensation board, in an opin
ion filed by Commisisoner Leech,
rules that hernia const itutes an "in
jury by accident." A coal company
resisted payment on the ground that
while the worker sustained a rupture
his injury was simply an aggravation
of a condition that had previously ex
isted. In this connection Commis
sioner Leech said:
"The workmen's compensation law
does noi prescribe any standard of
health or physical condition to which
the workman must conform to qualify
lor compensation, nor does it imply
a warranty on the employe's part
that he is tree from latent disease or
physical defect which may develop
into serious injury.'
The commissioner points out that
it has been a settled law in England
since 1903 that nothing more is re
quired to constitute an "injury by ac
cident than that the harm which the
workman sustains is unexpected."
