staff conference, of the entente ulliosil.v
In London In May and June are be
coming continually more apparent in
the fo-ordinalion or the allien at -
tucks on the Teutonic forces and ln -
creasing evidence of the initiative
passing from the Teutons to the allies
at almost all points.
As the French and British armies
now are engaged in rHorEani.iiuj and
preparing f01' ,n0 second phase of the
battle of the Somme, there is a com
parative lull on the western front, and
Russia nualn takes the center of the
sta,;e. Today's news from Felrofjrid
is hiphly important in the light of the
future development of the Somme
battle. The news that the Russians
have uiptiired 5,(100 prisoners on the
Dnelster front appears to leave little
doubt of the collapse of the Austrian
forces between Hiuacz and Stanisluu.
which will ETcatlv affect the army oi
lieneral von Hothmer, compelling him
1o retire northward while the advance
on Delatyn and the seizure of the
railway i ut off von Bothnier f i om his
chief base of supplies.
(oiinler Offensive Not Kxpccted.
The prospect of Field Marshal von
Hiiirtenbunr being able to make an
effective diversion is believed here to
be dwindling. While the (ierilians
are desperately engaged in trying to
meet tlie Russian offensive ut Harau
evic'iii. tlie Russian General Kalediiu-s
in developing a. strong attack on both
sidiH of the Kiev-Kovel railway.
The ijUchlicii ari.-:es among uiiiitai,v
men here as to how C.ermsny can
eonie to tlie assistance of her Aus
trian allies without further depleting
her forces on the western front, atpl
it is considered Impossible for Aus
tria to risk withdrawing more of her
own troops from the Italian front. It
would be Interesting to watch the re
action of the western and eastern
floats on each other in the develop
ment of the battle of th? Somme. and
the continued (leinian offensive on
the bunks of the Meuse.
Unions Want More Details.
Dissatisfaction Is again being voiced
by the Hritish newspapers at the iti
ndeipiucy and vagueness of the Hritish
official reports. The reticence or si
lence of General Sir IXtuMii HaiK's
communications on important points
i" '-ompnred with the readiness with
Which the French and Russian com
manders give details of Ihe operations'
and with the greatly increased lati
tude permitted to special correspond
ents on the western front wince the be
ginning of the battle.
That the Hritish authorities fully
realize that their hard tusk is far from
ended y indicated by the steps which
are being taken by the ministry of
munitions for Ihe cessation of holi
days for munition workers during
July The expenditure of munitions j
In the Somme battle has 'been thej
theme and surprise of all correspond-j
cuts at the front and the nation is
aware that nothing must he allowed to
interfere with the maintenance of a
full supply.
The transfer -f David Uoyd-t leorge

officially announced. Lord Derby,
who did valuable work in recruitinR
