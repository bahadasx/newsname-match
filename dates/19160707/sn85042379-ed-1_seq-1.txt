JULY FOURTH
WAS BIG DAY
Many Towns Fittingly Celebrate
National Birthday.
BIG CROWDS EVERYWHERE
Glasgow People Attend Opheim,
Nashua and Tampico Celebrations.
Glad Hand Everywhere.
_ , „ , , .
Independence Day was observed in
real old fashioned patriotic displays I
at Nashua, Opheim Hinsdale
Tam p ico, as weH asj>y a large num;
ber of picnic parties at
places on the Milk River.
There was greater display of a
more enthusiastic regard for this
birthday of the great nation than has
been witnessed for many years, and
it can be attributed no doubt, to the
present stand of the United States in
the Mexican affair. Patriotism was
on tap and it flowed without reserve
from every group of picnicers and ev
ery gathering in all the towns of Val
ley County where formal speeches
■were made. The tone of all remarks
was of loyalty to the Red, White and
l
Blue, the Declaration of Independence
was emphatically supported,
and
Uncle Sam lauded to the skies.
Opheim pulled off a duplication of
the big events of two years ago, go
ing even botter this year than before;
and with speeches, races, base ball
games and other sports, intermingled
during the entire day, kept every one
on the jump without an idle moment.
Hon. Tom Coleman mounted on his
famous black charger, acted as Mar
shal of the day and his smiling coun
tenance w - as everywhere noticeable,
keeping the events of the day pro
gressing without a hitch. He is a
man peculiarly adapted for the posi
tion, and Opheim is lucky to have en
gaged his services.
The glad hand of welcome was evi
denced by the banner spread over
Main Street bearing the legend "Op
heim is Yours." To show it was a
true legend, every resident of that
hustling little city was out to see
that all visitors had the best time
ever.
E. W. Burke, acted as chairman to
introduce the speakers. Dr. Mark D. I
, 7 , ; VrTr w r nmm pr I
Hoyt spoke for the Glasgow Commer
cial Club and the Valley County Fair
Association. He extended to the !
hearty invitation toi
North Country, a
be in Glasgow when the big fair is on
in September. He was followed by
Judge F. N. Utter who made a very
patriotic address in which he spoke of
the wonderful faith in this nation dis
played by its citizens, lauded the
great men who helped create it and
inspired the present generation to up
hold this great nation of life and lib
erty as it has been supported in the
past.
Following the speeches, Baylor and
Kincaid, Can., played a game of base
ball which was won by the Canadians j
14 to 11. It was an exciting game
and was followed with interest by j
a large crowd. The big game of the
day was then played between Glas
gow and Opheim. This was car
ried off by the County Seat team in a
fast game, full of real inside base
ball. It was anybody's game up un
til the last man was out in the ninth,
and kept those in attendance on their
toes every minute. Spaulding pitch
ed a great game, Hurly caught in his
usual excellent manner and every"
player displayed excellent ability. It
was a game well worthy seeing.
About thirty cars f&m Glasgow
joined in the celebration at Opheim
and everyone came home, tired, dusty
and happy.
A big delegation from Glasgow
went to Nashua to help that town
make the Fourth a success and it
proved one of the very best. Speeches
and sports occupied the day and ev
ery one reported a real good time.
The Nashua people had planned fit
tingly to observe the nation's birth
day and the events were staged in
real lively fashion.
At Tampico, the famers had erected
a big pavilion where the day's pro
program was carried out with great
enthusiasm. Speeches followed by
sporting events occupied the day, fin-1
ishing off with a jolly dance in the
evening. There were many of Glas
gow's citizens here too and their,
praise of the good time offered
is
proof that it was all that could be
desired.
The day was clear and warm with
a coo l breeze blowing, just the kind
of a day for everyone to get out and
celebrate to their heart's desire. In
fact July Fourti.
remembered in
real National Birthda.

FARMERS HOLD
GOOD MEETING
Large Attendance at Institute Held
Here Saturday.
The Farmers' Institute held at the
Court House last Saturday proved a
bigger success '.ban ever before, and
demonstrated the growing interest
taken by th" farmers in this vicinity
j in this work. Dr. W. J. Hartman,
[veterinary at the Montana State Col
j lege made a very interesting talk
relative to the care of live-stock on
the farm. He outlined methods to
pursue in curing stock of various ail
ments, illustrating with pictures of
various remedies used and how to ap
ply them. Many interesting ques
tions were asked by famrers and a
good discussion of a general nature
was brought out.
Jas. Griffin of Chinook discussed
alfalfa, its feeding qualities and how
to properly grow it for seed. He has
made a wonderful success on his own
farm growing seed and his discussion
of planting, cultivating and harvest
ing the crop was followed with great
interest. The advocation by him of
planting alfalfa in rows brought out
a general discussion of the results ob
tained, every one present joining in
making the meeting lively and bring
! j n g 0 ut many vaulable points bene
I ficial to all. Corn came in for a
share of the discussion and it was
j found that a greater acreage is in
corn here this year than ever before,
| Mr. Griffin brought out the great
benefits to the farmers of having a
j County Agriculturist employed and
it was learned that the Valley Coun
ty Commissioners are in favor of em
ploying such a man as soon as the
county is financially able to do so.
j Both speakers complimented the
farmers in attendance for their lively
I interest displayed, stating that the
Institute held at Glasgow was the best
| one of all those held along the Great
Northern. The court room was well
filled a id all stayed until the very
last discussion which lasted until af
ter five o'clock.

MEETS DEATH IN
TERRIFIC STORM
Cyclone Kills Miss Norah Nereson
and Does Much Damage.
A cyclone which struck about for
ty-five miles north of Saco Wednes
day evening instantly killed Miss
Norah Nerason, a young lady holding
down a claim in that neighborhood.
Miss Nereson had just come to Mon
tana from Minnesota and had only
lived on her homestead about two
months. She was in the shack when
the cyclone struck it, completely de
molishing the building and killing her
instantly.
In addition to the Miss Nereson
shack numerous other farm buildings

done to crops and stock. The storm
was the most terrific ever experienced
in that section according to reports.

GLASGOW TRIMS
BIG LEAGUERS
Locals Take Game From Picked!
Team Of Sheridan County
League at Opheim.
The Glasgow ball team journeyed
to Opheim Tuesday morning for the
supposed purpose of crossing bats
with a crack organization from Kin
caid, Canada. Upon arriving at the
orth country town, however, it. was I
Uncovered that Kincaid, not under
derstanding the rules of American
base ball had only brought along
players enough to make up a basket
all team, and inasmuch as a basket
ball game had not been advertised
things had to be changed.
Opheim had made a deal for the
pick of the Sheridan county
league teams Tor the day and in or
d>'i not to fi'.sappoint the cr>w<i, of
fered to take on the Glasgow team
in place of Kincaid. Far be it from
us to believe that Opheim had planned
anything ahead that would be
'
de- !
rogatory to the interests of their cour- j
ty seat, but it must be confessed that j
they had lined up "some ball team" ;
and as soon as arrangements were
made to play, they proceeded to show
their confidence in the boys by offer
ing to bet everything in Opheim on
them, even the town pump. Glas
gow is naturally a peaceable burg
ind does not believe in such a vul
gar thing as betting on a ball game,
< fact, we would much rather not,
you know. But there was no gain
saying the Ophehn sports, and there
by hangs the tale.
The game was called at three o'c I ock
and it was evident from the first ir
iing that the crowda were due to got
heir money's worth of good fast base
ball
Opheim had the fastest team lined
up that the locals have played thi3
season, which we are quite willing to
admit, but Spaulding
form and the entire
practically errorless ball behind him,
especially in the pinches. The game
went for six innings with 0-0 on the
was in rare
team played
b^ard for both teams when the Glas-'gon;
fiw boys commenced to take a lik
ing to "Heap" Swanson's offerings
ri d drove about six of them out of
the city limits for safe bingles. When
f he smoke cleared away Glasgow hau
four scores and things looked black
li'oi Opheim. In the eighth, however,
Opheim team came back with
three safeties and managed to Jrivf:
in three runs, making the score \-'i
bet'ore they were retired.
In the ninth the first man up fir
Glasgow hit safely but .the next bat
ter hit into a double play and the
side was retired without scoring.
In Opheim's half of the ninth Spaul
ding was invincible, striking out two
men and the third one grounded to
Movold for an easy out and the game
was over.
In the excitement following the
game some one misplaced the score
book and we are unable to give the
box score and summary of the game, '
but suffice it to say that the entire j
team played a splendid game, and !
Glasgow can justly be proud of the
fastest ball team in northern Montana.
G. N. MUST POST TIME
The state railroad commission has
issued an order requiring the Great
Northern to bulletin the arrival of its
passenger trains at Montana points.
This is a supplement to an order is
sued a .week ago.
The commission believes that it is
to the interest of the traveling public
to be informed as to the arrival of
the trains, and calls attention to the
state law which compels railroads to
post the time of the arrival of their
trains at least four hours ahead, and
that any change of 30 minutes
more must be recorded on the bullet
in board in or near the depot.
The Great Northern has already
taken steps to comply with the order
of the commission.

Jennings Webb of Saco Drownetr*
in Milk River Saturday.
In Attempting to Recover Body of
Ike Murphy Boat Capsizes and
Saco Young Man is Drowned
Following the sad story of the
dr owning of I. M. Murphy at Malta a
short time ago comes a story just
sad from Saco. It will be re
membered that all attempts to locate
the body of Murphy were unavailing
and the search had practically been
abandoned. Saturday afternoon men
working near the Milk River at Saco
noticed a body lodged in the net
which had been stretched across the
river at that point.
Forrest Crutchfield and Jennings
Webb got into a boat and went out
into the river after the body. Jn
trying to get the body into the boat,
however, the boat capsized précipitât,
ing both Crutchfield and Webb into
the river. Both were good swim
mers and it was thought by all that
they would make shore easily. Webb
seemed to be making good headway
when he apparently gave out and
sank. All attempts to locate the
-ody at the time failed but it was
recovered last night about a half mile
below where it disappeared
This second drowning casts a gloom
over the entire county. Jennings
Webb was twenty-one years old and
was a son of Dennis Webb, a farmer
who resides north of Saco. The fun
eral will be held tomarrow. Inter
ment in the Saco cemetery.
ROMANCE ENDS HAPPILY
It will be remembered that about
two weeks ago: the daily papers of
the country contained reports of an'
unusual wedding which took place
over the telephone between Havre,
and Portland, Oregon. The con
tracting parties were Mr. Arthur
Hruegger, who is employed by tha
Glasgow Construction Company and
Miss Harriet Hudnutt of Portland
Many of the papers gave out the er
jpneous report that W. H. Hudnut,
father of the bride, was opposed to
the match, but Mr. Hudnutt, who was
a visitor in Glasgow Saturday, em
phatically denies this. He stated to
a Courier reporter that he was wholly
agreeable to the wedding but was not
in favor of long distance phone mar
riage, so he accompanied his daugh
ter from Portland here where tha
happy young couple were duly mar
ried again by the Rev. Britton it
the Baptist parsonage Saturday morn
ing. Mr. Hudnutt left again the
same evening for him home in Port
land where he has a position with
the city. Mr. and Mrs. Bruegger
will make their home in Glasgow for
th e present,
