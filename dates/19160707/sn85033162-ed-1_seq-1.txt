NEWPORT
The city was ay being decorated
with flags and bunting to celebrate the
One Huadred and Fortieth Anniver
sary of our National Independence.
The day was ushered In with bright
sunshine and clear skys, contrary to
expectations,. Usually In celebrating
the Fourth a grand stand Is erected
and seats provided for the people; but
In this case the celebration took place
on Front street in front of the "Abbey",
a jitney truck served as a grand stand
and the president and speakers of the
day took their places on this unique
platform. Hon. R. A. Beneell acted as
president of the day and he also read
in a clear strong voice the Immortal
Declaration of Independence. Rev.
George E. Pratt pronounced the invo
cation. The side-walks and streets
were covered with people who had
come to enjoy the exercises. The ho
tel lobby and verandas were also
covered with people who wished to
hear the splendid patriotic orations
delivered by Rev. Edmond T. Simpson,
orator of the day and Mark Weather
ford candidate for Congress. Mr,
Simpson is a forelgnor by birth but he
has been an American citizen for many
years. He bellves In preparedness and
tli Inks every citizen should be willing
to sprve his country In time of danger.
He does not believe In a hyphenated
citizen but everyone should be true to
his country in' time of need. Mr.
Weatherford's address was also bright,
eloquent and patriotic. He Is a very
bright lawyer and will no doubt make
his mark In the world. Afternoon was

SALADO
The glorious Fourth passed
off with a crack on Big Elk this
year.
I lay making will be the order
If this good weather will last, the
hay crop looks good considering
the backward spring.
Thanks for the tip, Harlan, if
hot air kept the frost out of your
garden it may work here O. K.
As this scribe could not attend
the celebration at Deer Creek,
we are pleased to send in an ar
ticle handed to us by a party who
was there.
Why can't there be a County
fair. We are told by Borne that
a fair is a detriment because the
people of the County try to boost
a real estate swindle through In

to show the products from dif
ferent communities to get the
people to strive with each other
and by so doing they raise better
crops and more pure blood stock
which Lincoln County needs by
all means. Hold local fairs so
people will take an Interest in
their communities which will In

fairs.

horses. No one got hurt but a
