Miss Helen Motts went to Ottumwa
one day last week and witnessed the
"Birth of a Nation."
tWe enjoyed the article in the By
stander this week written by one Mr.
Horace Spencer, a former resident of
this place, and only wish that more
of our people could have the oppor
tunity to read it The way for our
people to get hold of such things is
to subscribe for the colored papers.
There is not a family that does not
take some of the other papers, bat!
when it comes to get them to take one
of ours it is another thing, they
think, and do not want it. We should
get out of that narrow path and help
those who help us. Get one of our
papers in your home, those who
haven't, and know what Is going on
among us.

The action of the United States in
the case of the enlistment of Dr.
Booker for service would have a ten
dency to make "one" disloyal-and un
patriotic, sorry to Bay. They have
enough probably without us, but wait,
and see. We know what we have
done in the past, and only in the last
