THIRTIETH YEAR
ZUEBLIN TO
LECTURE AT
CHAUTAUQUA
Publicist and Author to

DEMOCRACY, TOPIC
Has Done Much Good
Work for Civic Im-
provement
Chautauqua's purpose is to project
dominant civic forces into communi
ties otherwise severed from immedi
ate contact with those forces by rea
son of size or location. This primary
phase of the Chautauqua is emphasized
this year in the entertainment for
Grays Harbor, July 15 to 21. By those
familiar with the directing powers of
the practical reforms which have se
cured a spiked foothold in America,
it is generally conceded that the im
pellant genius of the nation-wide
awakening of our civic conscience is
Charles Zueblin, the publicist, lectur
«r and author of Boston. Zueblin is
-a chief ornament to the splendid lec
ture staff of the western Chautauqua
for 1916.
The lecture which Zueblin will de
liver ut the chautauqua will be a sa
lient composite of the keys to his
three authoritative books: "Democra
cy and the Overman," "The Religion
*>f a Democrat," and "American Muni
cipal Progress"—a digest of which
may be summed up in a sentence:
"Democracy, national and municipal,
expressed in the fellowship of human
service."
In a series of campaigns for civic
Improvement, extending over a period
of nearly twenty-five years, Zueblin
has left an enduring impress on those
■of our American cities, which for effi
ciency In administration, beauty and
cleanliness of streets, parks and build
ings—the democratizing of human
wants, In terms of mutual service—
have become a by-word among travel
ers and authorities on municipal pro
gress.
Wood Waste Used
in Larger Quantities
Making Pulp Now
The use of a steadily increasing
amount of wood waste in the manufac
ture of pulp is indicated by figures
compiled by the forest service. Al
though the pulp industry showed a de
cline in the last year for which com
plete figures are available, 1914, on ac
count of the increasing cost of raw
material and general business condi
tions, more wood waste was used than
in any previous ye<>-
Approximate!-"- "" cords of waste
with a v." 1 "* $1,400,000 were util
ized by 35 of the 200 pulp and paper
mills of the United States. It is
thought that as the price of cord wood
goes up the amount of wood waste
used will become greater.
The Canadian pulp industry has, it
Is stated, had a vigorous growth during
the last few years and the greater
portion of its product is marketed in
the United States. An average cost
of about $6-50 per cord, as compared
with the $10 to $16 per cord which
many manufacturers in this country
are paying for pulpwood, is the reason
given for the growth.
BENN IS CANDIDATE
Ed Benn Is out for the Republican
nomination for county commissioner
from the Second district. He qualifies
his announcement by the declaration
that he will do no campaigning, so
licit no votes, spend no money on ad
vertising his candidacy. He says he
would rather see Phil Locke run again
but, In default of his candidacy, will
make the race himself.
JOBS HELD OPEN
Employes of the Northern Pacific
railroad who have enlisted for service
in the Mexican trouble may have their
jobs on their return from duty. In
structions to this effect have been
received at the local Northern Pacific
offices from J. M. Hannaford, presi
dent of the company. It Is ordered
that in all such cases leave of absence
be granted the men.

article in your issue of May 26th, An
alleged evangelist calling himself
"Three Fingered Jack" claims to have
won money from me at some game
called "pastime" in Philadelphia. His
story is false. He does not know me,
and never won a cent from me, and
I never before heard of such a game.
If he Is untrustworthy in this, he may
be dishonest in other ways, and you
may wish to warn your readers against
him, therefore I send you these facts."

Door Industry for
State Shows Gain
In Past 5 Years
Manufacture in Washington increases
80 Per Cent in Period
Figures compiled by the forest ser
vice show a gain of eighty per cent,
during the past five years, in the vol
ume of business developed by the sash
and door industry of the state of
Washington.
Accordingf to the service compila
tion, an unusual condition prevails in
Washington In regard to the manufac
ture of sasb nod doors. In the first
place, many large sawmill operators
make sash and doors In connection
with the manufacture of-lumber. They
purchase their raw material In the
form of logs, usually of high grade,
and thus get It much cheaper than the
manufacturer who does not run a saw
mill. Then, too, the Washington man
ufacturers have accomplished much in
the way of standardization of their
products.
Furthermore, veneered doors made
from such western woods as Douglas
fir, western yellow pine, western white
pine, Sitka spruce, and western red
cedar, present a choice of grain im
possible to obtain in solid lumber pan
els, and this variety of effect has
done much to make the Washington
doors popular even in competition with
, eastern made goods, The Washing
ton product is now shipped to Cali
fornia, Utah, the Mississippi valley,
and foreign markets.
The report suggests that the lim
ited use of hemlock offers an excel
lent opportunity to develop greater use
of this western wood, for its freedom
from pitch makes it superior to many
of the more popular species for door
manufacture.
A BIG EVENT.
There are certain outstanding events
in the business life of every city, oc
casions which the public learn to wait
for and in which they have perfect
confidence such an event is the July
Clearance Sale as conducted by Geo.
J. Wolff.
Many of the remarkable and timely
offerings are quoted on page eight of
this issue and one cannot do better
than carefully peruse the whole page.
It would be manifestly impossible to
quote or speak of all the special offer
ings, there is practically no end to
them. Ladies Skirts at half price is
surely attractive news; Golf Skirts for
women, worth $2.00, for 48c; Lingerie
Waists, also Silk Waists, worth up to
$5.00, for 48c; R. & G. Corsets at less
than half price. Prices on Redfern
Corsets nearly cut in two. Suits and
Coats from $5.00 and upward—these
lines at unheard of reductions. Chil
dren's white Lingerie Dresses at half
price, commencing at 75c and scores
and scores of lines of staple Dry Goods
on which reductions are made of 10%
to 33%%. Crepes, Galateas, Ginghams,
Silkolines, Tissues, Satines and scores
of all kinds of Novelty Wash Goods at
the most drastic cut In prices. Our
people do not have to be reminded
of the very superior stock carried by
this firm and the great popularity en
joyed by them. This high standing in
the community has been well earned.
This is the time to buy liberally.

DRY, BUT GINGERY"
| Three Days of Whole
some Enjoyment Are
Furnished
The fourth annual Grays Harbor
Splash has passed into history. Tha
local Moose lodge and the citizens
who cooperated with that organization
in its work are to be felicitated upon
the success of the Splash in Aberdeen.
It will bear comparison with the three
preceding celebrations. Another thing
has been demonstrated: that a whole
lot of fun may be enjoyed by huge
crowds even in a dry town.
Starting with Monday's features, the
children's parade and field sports, the
Rose Show and the smoker at tha
Grand theater, three days of whole
gome enjoyment were furnished a
crowd that, in the judgment of many
| by the night of the Fourth almost had
doubled Aberdeen's population.
Tuesday morning something like
20,000 persons lined up on the streets
to watch the big preparedness pa
rade, in which close to 2,000 men aftf
women of all walks of life, march##.
When the water sports opened Tues
day afternoon OH the Wlshkati river
the banks of that stream fttr blocks
were dense with the mass of humanity
that saw a wonderfully fine program. „
Wednesday saw no less an entertaiif
ment, with its automobile parade, fin
ish of the water sports and relay races.
All in all, it is Bftfe to say that tha
thousands of visitor's from t all part#
of the county were satisfied with t!;e
fourth annual Splash and that they
will come again next year, to Ho
quiam. In passing, the hearty cooper
ation shown by the sister city's offi
cials, lodges and citizens should be
noted.
SALVATIONISTS
APPEALING FOR
FINANCIAL AID
On account of the generally de
pressed business condition the last
two years, the Salvation Army has
gone behind with their expenses to
the amount of about $300. This may
not seem to be a very great deficiency
for the average church, but for an or
ganization like the Army, which works
chiefly among the poor, and is
ported largely by small contributions,
it 18 quite ftn Item, This does not
include the deficiency for officers' sat-'
aries. Our officers cheerfully made
great sacrifices to maintain our work.
Mrs. Roe and myself have received
an average of $5.52 per week durln*
our administration, out of which wo
must live and clothe ourselves and our
two small children.
Our creditors have made us Hberat
discounts and we can clear our corps
of debt for about $150 if we can rats*
that amount within the next few days.
The ladies' aid are arranging for *
bazaar, or sale of work within a short
time and hope to raise money In that
way.
Anyone desiring to contribute to th#
fund either in cash or something for
the sale of work, can call 307 and
someone will call for your contrlbo»
tion. Phone before 9 a. n.
During the laat four and one-halt
months, since we came to the city
we have conducted 101 open air meet
ings, 124 inside meetings and 21 junior
meetings. We have had 12 converts,
mostly people who would never go to
church. We have given away free lit
garments, 30 pairs of shoes, 20 meals,
two bedsteads, one mattress and cot
and other articles of furniture.
