Our County Judge we have always
liked. The others we are not per
sonally acquainted with, but we
know that they are gentlemen or
they could not have been elected
to the office they now hold. It we
have gone beyond our limit we are
willing to make atonement If the
gentleman thinks we have intended
to hand any one a lemon, he has a
wrong conception of the English
language. We have no criticism
to offer and no fault to lind with
Brodhead, should the road only
goto Brodhead. but the thing we
want and the thing this section is
looking for, is a road Irom our
town which will Irad us right into
the good town of Brodhead. Work
start d on this end of the line

ward to that good day when Liv
ingston, Mt. Vernon and Brod
head will be joined by a spleuuid
pike. With the following lines
dedicated to the Brodhead corres
pondent we clcse:.
Well, my friend, control your an
ger, Don't let it carry you away.
For the lives of great men before us
Have been vexed in their day
Dou't get mad at a fellow writer.
And get yourself in such a fix,
'ust because he happens to meet
you
On the subject of politics
So, my friend, go cool your anger,
And a lesson from this take,
And if ever we do meet you,
We will take a good hand shake.
Go right on and write your letters,
Give the Signal all the news,
But in the future do remember,
The Livingston writer not to
abuse.
