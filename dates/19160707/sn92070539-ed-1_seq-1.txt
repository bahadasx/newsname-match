"Your Uncle Sam
As a Road Builder"
Constructs Military Highways Into
Mexico to Feed the Punitive
Expedition
1IY J 1 ; A N CAllAl.l. O'NKIM.
Tho punitive expedition seems
to have reached tlu mechanical
stage, not in n spiritual sense,
for there is nothing mt'clmnienl
in the manner in which the
nllieors and men ure putting in
their days in harness, but be
cause the progress of events has
come to a point that mechanical
mds to the business of keeping
the men in lighting trim are tho
chief factors in ttio scheme of
things here- Koad building is
now in progress in a suientllle
manner over a great' extent of
Mexican territory, because the
millions of tons of weight that
have passed over the trail in the
past twelve weeks have cut so
deep into the ground that when
ram coiue.s the section where the
American Hoops are located will
lie cut otf from this base. Fur
Hns purpose there are now new
road building machines, costing
i great deal of money, lying here
watting until thu pi ogress of
the roadmakmg calls them into
play. The engineers of the
I'nhed Slates tinny aie in coin
inand or the work, but most ol
the workers seem to be peons,
vim are cheap, ll nothing else.
Some ol thu civilian ti tick driver.-
are helping on this hard service,
hut thuy nro quite cheerful in
their labors, lor they have had
vi tunny nwlul jolts from the
uadness of the going they wil

"An army moves on its belly,"
i- veteran-of .some of the nu
merous American wars tell us
i mil a sold'er i- of little value at
my time unle.-s he is properly
led the highest courage in
man's heart counting for little if
the man is weak from hunger.
The outer world has not tho
.-lightest conception of the al
most awe-inspiring job it is to
I ted the American urmy, which
is strung along in desert and
desolate lands, where lack of
a, iter, high aliunde und constant
wind ami sand make.- the labor
il supplying looil and water
i lie heaviest undertaking thu
wirld has ever known. Hut for
i he mechanical aids to action the
vpediiiou would have had to he
.vithdruwe within the llrst week
i the beginning of the Villa
Hunt.
It is computed that a soldier in
the In Id needs four pounds of
loud daily. Al the same time it
is believed that every annual
needs ten pounds ol gram and
ton i teen pounds of hay or forage.
:
Reliability Is What
For more than six years Sam Ravel has done business in
Columbus. His reputation for fair dealing has stood the
test of time. He has handled good goods and always sold
them at reasonable prices. His friends and customers have
stayed through all these years. Only standard goods are
carried. You cannot do better than trade with him.
SAM RAVEL
It is nut permitted to say how
many soldiers and horses ami
mules are now in active service
but tho men are eating four hun
dred thousand pounds of bacon,
hardtack, potatoes, benf and can
ned stuffs each week.
And none of that material is
found In Mexico, unless a little
fresh beef Is counted In; water
also is often carried, and oil, and
then the thousands of articles for
maintenaceof trucks ami ho-pital
and equipment of man and beast.
All this gigartic supply service
is under the quutcrmastcr's de
partment, and the chief oflieer In
this splendid work is Major J. F.
Madden. Heis"the boy wondur"
for what he can accomplish, and
better still forwhathe can inspire
others to accomplish.
Directly under Major Madden
and in charge of all construction
work is Capt. S. H. Pearson.
The latter lias had much ex
perience in big construction
work and is said to "think in
thousands."
The supply "f the food, fotage,
e'.c, needed for this expedition
would be a sorious problem if it
was shipped by raiiway alone,
but add to this the fact that
everything has to be brought to
Columbus, N. M., from some
where in the distant SUUes, lo
begin with; it has to llrst be or
dered, after careful calculation,
then to be checked and trans
shipped, mounted on motor
trucks and sent over tho line by
man driven cars from til'teen to
live hundred miles. The work I
almost beyond mental compre
hension, still it is accomplished
every day almost without a Inch.
Had not the country graduated
from tho army mule and pack and
wagon train this fuat of feeding
the army in Mexico would have
been impossible.
Hut by a wonderful streak ol
luck Uncle Sain was able togruh
a few hundred motor trucks ah
ready to be shipped to Europe.
There are "Whites" and Jeff
rey.s" and the ' "Four-Wheel
Drive," and Packuid-; al.-o the
man killer.-, of which we will try
to say little, theso having been
"wi-lied" on "the aviation squa
dron," Quads they are culled,
ami, the "Locomobile.-,' and won
derfully all tho.-e are standing
up under the .strain.
In ordinary tunes it would
have taken months to assemble
these truck train.-, but the auto
mobile companies offered them
to the government, who grabbed
the Iter "pretty pronto " To
get them here in any sort of time
"our Uncle" had to pay dreadful
expressago hills. Mo.-t of the.-e
cars come from far away, some
even from Connecticut. Some of

COLUMBUS,
New Mexico
July 3rd Enlivened
by Boxing Matches
Jack Arnold Won the Main Event
on a Foul, Though Many Think
Strouer Was the Better Man.
Columbus has had a lively week
between celobriitians of the In
dependence day, the arrival of
another tine body of National
Guards, this time from far away
Massachusetts nnd two sets of
boxing bouts. Neither of the
latter was quite up to the ex
pectutions ol the promoters for
the bouls were so soon over with
In every case, except the very
ciuvur sparring match of Wi (lie
Siebert, of the Hospital Corps;
and Hug Doyle, of the New Mux I

Doyle and Siebert wore surely
a charming pair of youngsters

cision of the referee was"a draw"
so evenly w o r e the lighters

The suprise of the evening was
the whirlwind performance o f

up against Jack Courtier of the
First Aero Squadron, and with
one hook to the jaw hung the
Squadron man in the ropes, where
Wilson proceeded to punch Cour

Society Los Gringos Punitivos
Among the celebrations that!
marked the 4th of July, one of
the most enjoyable roported. was
that of the Society Los Gringos
Punltlvos. This society is com
posed of employees ol the quar
termaster's corps of the army
and was organized at Columbus
on April III), 11)10, to commemor
ate the punitive expedition into
Mexico and has for its objects
the perpetuation of the assoui
ations formed during the exist
ence of the punitive expedition
and to foster tho spirit of Amer
ican patriotism nnd prido in
American institutions, as well us
to inculcate tho principles of
friendship.
The entire personnel of tho so
ciety In Columbus, accompanied
by six candidates for admission,
loft Columbus in three motor
trucks at about 1:00 p.m. and
arrived at the mining camp of
Ties Hormmas at about !l;00 p.
in. Here the trucks were un
loaded nnd under the blue can
opy of heaven the llrst initiation
ceremony of the society was car
ried out. The drill team, con
sisting of Messrs. Shields. Smith
nnd Stack, known as the ''Triple
S" administered the mystic rites
of the "Hurning Mesa" and the
"O.-culatory Hurro," the work
being directed by El Gringo Pe
quino Mitchell. After the ini
tiatory services were concluded
refreshments were served and
wore immensely enjoyed as the
long ride had served to sharpen
appetites. The lelre.-h in e n ts
stowed away, various games
were indulged in until the length
uning shadows gave warning pf
tho approach of night, when do
i suite the kind invitations of the
! citizens of Tres Hermanns tore
"niin and attend a "Untie," all
l',L'"' into 1,10 trucks and a record
run was made Icr Columbus.
The birth of this society wns
due to a suggestion of Mr. C P.
Daly, assistant to the quarter
master general of the nrmy, who
was recently in Columbus on nn
inspection trip from Washington,
D. C, and wiiat at that time was
organized only us a local affair
now gives promise of becoming
a national society, as many inqui
rles have been reached from ns
far nway as New York, f rom in
dividuals who have seen service
with tho expedition and are do
sirons of joining thu society.
Tho officers of the society are:
C. P. Daly, El Gringo Grande: D
K. Mitchell, El 'Gringo Peqnino;
G. W. Douglass, Ei E-cribente;
J. Vivldes, El Jele Handido: J L.
Whitmeyer, El Padre: Neil
Shields, El Sentinel Exterior; F.
A. Smith, El Sentinel Interior,
and T M. Stack, El Gula.
Most of the members have
seen service In Cuba, China, for
to Uico and the Philipinos and it
was the fast that so many re
unions of "'Old Timer.-" occurred
here that prompted the idea of a
society, which while having as
it- main idea the commemora
tion of the sojourn in Columbus,
would also serve to keep the
member.- in touch with one an
other after the expedition had i
passed into history.

July 4 Celebrations
At the Army Base
Many Keenly (.Contested Gaines,
Band Concerts, &c, Which Were
Thoroughly Enjoyed By AH.
The Independence Day cole
bration, under the auspices of
Young Men's Christian Associa
tion Held secretary and tho kind
co operation of the officers of the
U. S army and National Guards,
will long be remom'bered by all
so fortunate as to enjoy the
varied program.
At six a. in. the massed bands
welcomed the occusion with
beautiful music, nnd at the ei.d
of the day ngaln the massed
bands gave a concert, with the
assistance of vocal selections
from an army quartette, which
finished out a day of peace and
pleasure, even if it was passed
In the American war wine.
Two ball games were "pulled
oil" notwithstanding the heat,
with great enjoyment, especially
to the onlookers who had nothing
to do but "look pleasant." The
llrst game was between married
men und single men. It is said
the married men got licked, but
being not unused to this expon
enco It was taken in good part.
Regulars nnd National Guards
also measured strength in a
hotly-contested game.
There was a varied program
of athletic contest-, including
mounted wae.-tliiig, foot races,
potato races, three-legged races,
human wheelbarrow race, sack
race, high jump, bucking con
test and centipede race, with
prizes in gold fur those who
excelled.
Everyone tried his best nnd
the losers lost very gracefully
Tho entire spirit of the contest
ants wns line, and everyone had
a good tune, and those who e.
celled wore congratulated heart
ily by all, for they worked linrd
and fairly for their rewards
Of the many attractive events
probably the centipede race ol
three teams was the funniest
Tho men were at one lime piled
up in a squirming mass forma
lion like a football team on u
spree; lor arm-antl leg entangle
uient they had the "chariot raci
in 'Hen Hurr" beat to a frazzle,
but in short order the human
units of tho centipede were
straightened out and went re
joicing to the goal.
The bucking conte.-t was a
lively affair, and as the horses
bucked and .swayed about the
field in unrestrained ardor, the
spectator.- pushing forward or
falling back as the performers
dashed forward or retreated.
This gave as many thrills to the
innocent bystander, who was
surely due to be stepped on if he
dlil not step liveiy, as it could
have dono to tho men and horses
holding tho center of the Held.
There was somu beautiful work
on the part of the men, partlcu
larly good whun It is remembered
that they had to ride without
spurs, nnd someone must have
told the horses of this regulation,
for they suroly seemed "wised
up," and behaved in some cases
like demon animals.
The "Committee of Stunts,"
who were responsible for the nt
, tnictivo celebration of tho 4th of
July, nre heartily thanked by nil

who took part and all who looked
