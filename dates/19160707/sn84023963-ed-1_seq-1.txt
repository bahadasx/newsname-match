PEGGY HOPKINS , A FORMER SOCIETY BELLC OF WASHINGTON DC.,
WHO 16 MOW APPEARING I IM rOETRO PICTURED
Tego-y TJopkins, the beautiful young- woman who is seen in an im- j
portantrole in "The Turmoil," the big Metro feature production, grew 1
tired of society life in Washington, D. C, where she was a leader in the
younger set until recently, and entered the ranks of photoplay artists.
She turned to motion pictures because she believed them to be more in
teresting and fascinating than the butterfly life of a society bud. And
shn soon found that her observation was correct. After two or three
days' work before the camera, Miss Hopkins declared that there was
more excitement and downright enjoyment crowded into one hour of
motion pictures than one would find in society in a year.

'THE VOICE IN THE DARK.
A Memory of Pickett's Brigade and f
Night Attack.
Some years after the civil war &
gathering of veterans of both sides
was exchanging reminiscences ut a
banquet given by the board of trade
of New York, writes Mrs. La Salle
Corbell Pickett in Lippincots.
The presiding ofHcer was Colonel
J. J. Phillips of the NintkYirginia
Tegiment, Pickett's division. He
was speaking of night attacks and
recalled one in particular, not be
cause of its startling horrors, but
because of a peculiar circumstance,
almost resulting in the compulsory
disobedience of orders the obey
ing, as it were, of a higher com
mand than that of earth.
'The point of attack had been .
carefully selected" said Colonel
Phillips, "the awaited dark night
had arrived, and my command was
to firs when General Pickett should
ßigiißl the order.
"There was that dread, indescrib- !
able stillness, that weird, ominous
eience. that always settles oyer
everything before a fight. Yodrfelt
that nowhere in the universe was
there any voice or motion.
"Suddenly the awesome silence
was broken by the sound of a deep,
full voice rolling over?tihe black
void like the billows of ,a'great sea,
directly in line with öirguns. It
was. singing the old hymn, 'Jesus,
Lover of My Soul
"I have heard that grarid old
music many times in circumstances
which intensifiofl its impiipssive
ness, bu jieverhad it seemed so
solemn ashen it broke the still

"The guns were .shifted, the vol

ered' with the shadow of .his wing."
A Federal veteran who had been
listening looked up suddenly and
said:
"I remembervjtjiight, colonel,
and that mi'dniLt' attack which
curried off so manyo'f my comrades.
I was the singer."
There was a second of silence.
