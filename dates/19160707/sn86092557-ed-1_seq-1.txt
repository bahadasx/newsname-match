That New Theory of Death
of Monongah For
eigner.
Hi IS OH
County Authorities Expect
to Make An Arrest
I Today.
County Coronor Frank Lloyd and
Deputy Sherrlff Thomas Buckley left
here this afternoon for Monongah
where they will likely exhume the
body of Prank Audla which was burled
there this morning. Audia was found
unconscious Wednesday morning ly
ing alongside a Baltimore and Ohio
railroad coke track with his skull frac
tured. There were no other marks
on the body. He was brought here
and taken to the Fairmont Hospital
No. 3 where he died yesterday morn
ing.
At first the county officers were
of the opinion that Audia had come to
his death through being hit by a
train. Developments since the burial
today have shown that Audia was
struck over the head with a piece of
coke by an Italian known in the neigh
borhood. It Is reported here that the
man who struck Audia* is demented
or at least irrational. Immediately af
ter hitting his man it is said he sat
down and wept biterly and Beted
otherwise peculiarly. Since the ex
citment following the finding of the
unconscious form the man has not
been about the place where the body
Wtf-found...--5-??,
The county officials were not notified
that a man had been hurt or killed at
Monongah and the only county officer
knowing anything of the circumstance
is Constable Satterfield who was on
the same car with the injured man re
turning from Everson to this city.'He
did not investigate, figuring that the
man had been Injured, as reported, by
a train. It is claimed that the track
next-to which the body was found was
not used by a locomotive on the night
previous to the day which the body
was found and this serves to strength
en the opinion of the officers that the
man met with foul play.
The officers say arrests will be made
today.

In doubt.
The West Virginian has gone out
in the field to gather circulation, and
they have succeeded as never before
in securing a list of additional readers
right In the territory which means
trade for the local advertiser in Fair
mont For such sen-ice as this the
West Virginian gladly distributes the
magnificent and valuable awards, tho
liberality of which has made even oth
er newspapers admit that "they didn't
see how it could be wone." But as was
expected the attractiveness of the prir
es has brought forth special effort, and
the West Virginian has without a
doubt almost completed the warmest
circulation campaign of any sort ever
conducted In Fairmont, In It's Seven
Thousand club.
But there is still much work to be
done. Don't loso a tingle minute be

PARIS, July 7.?The work of sort
ing the booty taken by the French
troops in the fighting at the Somme
brings to light many curious facts.
In the Mereaucourt woods a
heavy German battery was found
completely dismounted. The bat
tery commander's ihelter along re
mained Intact. The luxury of the
arrangement in the German posi
tion on the Santerre plateau show
ed that they wore considered im
pregnable. In the positions occu
pied by the battery mentioned were
a piano, a brass bedstead and a
complete hot and cold water sup
ply.
The greatest booty fell to Gen
, eral Balfourier's famous "Iron
Corps" which distinguished itself
at Verdun. This corps took enough
material to set up a whole army.

today that tfTe present long drawn out
session of the court would be adjourn
ed this evening until the next regular
spsslon which la the third Tuesday In
August.
A number of matters will be passed
on this evening before adjournment,
but because of the delay of the attor
neys only one order had been entered
at press time this afternoon. This
was a decree of sale and an order con

I Sometimes Friends See
That Good Cheer is In
All of the second primary election
expense statements have been llletf
I with the county clerk and the totai
number of Democratic candidates
i reached 32 while the total Republl
! can list reached 38. Many of these
Iwero filed late yesterday evening
[which was the last day of the thirty
days of the primary, in which the can
didates are required to-file-statementa^
The total ofrthose who stated that
thoy had received contributions was |
j only two and both of these were Dem-!
ocrats. In a previous report it was I
mentioned that William W. Conaway,
candidate for Justice or the peace, I
had listed contributions received from
several theatres in the way of free
advertising. A. M. Glover, candidate
for sheriff, seems to have boen moro
sucessful in this lino, howover, and
received the total of $38 while Cona
way only recolved $9. Glover accord
ing to his statement received "Meals
at Roush's $8, car faro $10, cigars $10,
auto hire Jas. Barnet $5. room at
Roush's $5. This $38 together with
the $42 listed In his first statement
brings Glover's total sum spent up I
to $80. , |
\V. T. Smith who was defeated by I
Glover spent a total of $168.20 in his i
campaign. Of this $113.45 was listed In |
the last statement. He lists "To Fair. ]
mont Times $50, D. B. Garrett for post,
advertising $21.00* Miss Fleming sten
ographer $3.50, F. C. McCray adver
tising $10, Harold Debendarfer auto
iiire'io" . ... ?
This may be taken as another II
lustration of the contention that mon
ey is not the chief factor in a prim
ary election. Smith by his state
ment spent $186.20 of his own money
and was defeated, while Glover who
was his opponent, spent only $42 of
his money and received contributions
of meals, room rent, cigars and free
car fare with the services of an auto
mobile. I
None of the Republicans roceived
contributions acordlng to their state-1
ments and in pratlcally every instance
the Democratic candidates for the
same office spent more than did the,
j Republicans.

OVER WORD VALUE
J. M. Black Would Like To
Know Just What Tem
porarily Means.
J. M. Black of tho Fairmont Wall
Plaster company discussing the action
of tho Fairmont Board of Affairs In
regard to the privileges of unloading
sand at tho city wharf this morning
said "I would like to know just what
the word temporary means to the
Board. The present holstjng engine
and dorrlck is only supposed to bo
'temporarily' on the city wharf, yet
It has been there since the beginning
of the construction of UieMonongaho
la railroad and the present Indications
are that It will remain Indefinitely.
Although at their meeting yesterday
the Board admitted that the wharf Is
for the nse of any cltiten yet there
are discriminating in favor of persons
who do not even reside in the state.
"Jnst what motive actuates them in
allowing the McCIane Sand compan>
of Point Marion to take up the entire
wharf space in unloading sand for
Nuium and Deberry Is another point
that I do not understand. Perhaps the
fact that the present sand is being
used for the construction of the Pres
byterian church and that the major
ity of the board are PresbyterlanB may
have some bearing on the matter.
Another question that puailes me la;
why did Ira Smith go to Brownsville

told him all about the ownership of
the plant on the wharf!"
