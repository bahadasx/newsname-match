A VETERAN PICNIC.
Last Sunday the veteran class in
the Methodist Sunday school decided
to have an afternoon picnic at the
city park on the fourth. So, even on
that short notice, the ladies baked
cakes and all necessary plans were
made to make the outing a very
pleasant occasion for all. There
were two freezers of ice cream and
plenty of cake. Twenty-five were
present and they made a jolly bunch
on the band stand, just room enough.
This is indeed a young-hearted set
and though their ages range from 50
to 80 years, they are not wasting
any time looking on the shady side
of life. After all, this is the way
to keep young. In heaven we shall
be perpetually young and happy.
After a short talk by the pastor,
appropriate to the celebration of our
country's birthday, and prayer, we
all were bountifully served with the
choicest ice cream and cake, then the
company dispersed feeling grateful
for the outing of the afternoon. And
they did not get wet either.
Let all the members of Ohe class
try to be regularly present at the
sessions of the Sunday school.
BY ONE WHO WAS THERE.
Traveling Man's Experience.
"In the summer of 1888 I had a
very severe attack of cholera mor
bus. Two phyicians werked over me
from four a. m. to 6p. m. without
giving me any relief and then told
me they Aid not expect me to live;
that I had best telegraph for my
family. Instead of doing so, I gave
the hotel porter fifty cents and told
him to buy me a bottle of Chamber
lian's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy, and take no substitute. I
took a double dose according to the
directions and went to sleep after the
second dose. At five o'clock the next
morning I was balled by mey order
and took a train for my next stop.

PHIL, COVERDALE INJURED II
IN AUTO ACCIDENT
Sunday morning a very serious ac
cident which was nearly fatal to v
Phillip Coverdale happene on the fi
gravel road about three miles east of V
Lake Charles, as Mr. Coverdale with b
his wife and three children were re- ti
turning to their home in Beaumont n
Texas, after having spent a week tl
visiting at the home of Mr. and Mr. P
W. J. Unkel at Kinder. n
Mr. Coverdale had not been feel- a
ing well during the morning and a, 0
parently in a comotose state he was
driving the car in too close proxim- f
ity to the ditch. When Mrs. Cover- tl
dale called his attention to the ap- b
parent danger he, becoming startled, li
turned his car too abruptly, witl a
the result that it skidded and cap
sized, precipitating all of the occu- s
pants to the hard gravel road. p
Mrs. Coverdale and the children e
were all severely bruisesd and s5
scratched, but not seriously injured, I
while Mr. Coverdale suffered the l
fracture of his collar bone and sev- ft
eral ribs. He was taken at once to
the Rigmaiden hotel for medical at- o
tention and later removed to St. Pat- tl
rick's sanitarium, where he will be s
confined for some time, although he d
is considered at present to be out of
danger.
The Coverdales are well remem
bered here in Welsh, where they re
sided before removing to Beaumont, E
Mr. Coverdale having been identified 6
with the rice interests here for at
number of years. He was manager
of the local Southern Rice Growers' 1
office until a little more than a year r
ago, when he accepted the manage- a
ment of the Beaumont office of the C
association.
Many friends here regret the ac
cident which befell our former towns
man and his estimable family. t
LAKE ARTHUR WINS
TWO GAMES ON WELSH
The Lake Arthur baseball nine de
feated the Welsh nine at Sportsman
park last Sunday by a score of 8 to I
6. Both teams showed some excel- I
lent ball playing and likewise a few
errors, but on the whole the game
was very interesting to the large
crowd of fans from Lake Arthur,
Jennings and Welsh, who were pres
ent. An interesting feature of the
game was the work of Umpire Dove
of Jennings, who is apparently dean
of the umps.
In the return game played at
Lake Arthur July 4, Lake Arthur
again defeated Welsh by a score of
11 to 10. When a shower inter
rupted the game at the end of the
sixth inning the score stood 6 to 3
in favor of Welsh, but the Welsh
boys were unable to resuscitate dur
ing the remaining three innings af
ter the shower. Not anticipating
rain they had left their pulmotor at
home.

INDEPENDENCE DAY
IS QUIET IN WELSH
The Fourth of July passsed off
very quietly in Welsh this year, the
first time in a number of years that
Welsh has not held an elaborate cele
bration in commemoration of the na
tion's birth. Although there were a
number of stay-at-homes, the most of
the citizens celebrated at the other
patriotic neighboring towns, Jen
nings, Lake Arthur, Lake Charles
ahd Crowley, having numerous visit
ors from Welsh.
Probably the largest delegation
from here was attracted to Lake Ar
thur, lured by the promise of cool
breezes and bathing offered by that
little city on the lake. They all spent
a most enjoyable day.
The weather man was on the job
strictly this fourth of July just
passed, which was probably the cool
est, most pleasant fourth of July this
section has enjoyed in many a ye
It was just warm enough for red
lemonade but not in the least uncom
fortable.
No serious accidents from the use
of fireworks have been reported in
the parish, thanks to the safe an,
sane propaganda, and a very little
disorderly conduct.
CARD OF THANKS.

ing our sincere thanks to the mem
bers of the Odd Fellows' Lodge, and

kindly provided such nice lunches to
serve us on the way.
Our hearts go out in sincere grati
tude to you all for this expression
of your sympathy annd may you be
richly rewarded.

Dragged to Death by Horse.
Claude, the 7-year-old son of Dan
Jannice, a farmer living six miles
east of Lake Charles, was dragged to
death Tuesday morning by a horse he
was taking from his home to the
field for his father. The boy was
riding the horse, which had been har
nessed up ready for work. When the
animal took fright the boy was trown
off, becoming entangled in the lines,
and was dragged several hundred
yards. His limbs were broken and
he was badly mangled. He lived only
a few minutes.
