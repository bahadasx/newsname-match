CONGRESSIONAL
.ASPIRANTS BUSY
. Dudleys Porter of Paris, candi
date, for Copgress, is actively can-
vassipg. the district and in a report '
of . his ipeeclumade at Trezevaut,
as reported in th&Tennessean and
American, he dwells almost alto
gether on the 'fact that because'
Mr. Sims entered the Senatorial
race last year and later withdrew,
and that he (Porter) announced
his intention to run. for Congress ,
whileMr. Sims was a candidate for
the Senate, that Mr Sims is run
ning against Porter and not Porter
against Sims. '1, '
What difference does it make to
the; Democratic voter which candi
date is running against the other!? -They
are both running for votes
Land are both qualified candidates -
in the. primary for the nomination,
anduunless t Porter 'Can give some
good. reason why -ho oan better
serve the Eighth district in Con- :
gress than Mr. Sims he will meet
defea' just as he did six years ago.
In that race Mr. Sims received
substantial majority over both hie
opponents and a large plurality
oer Porter. . .
Carroll County Democrats have
been generous in their support .Of
Mr. Sims,. and he has measured up
to every- obUgation as .their repre
sentative) in ( Congress, and with '
conditions aatthey now are in our
country's foreign affairs relations
with "war imminent, -"safe and
sane", men are needed in Washing
ton, and in our opinion it will be ,
many a i day before the voters in
this district change a man like Mr. .
Sims fort Pudley Porter to repre
sent them'- in Congress.-rOarroll '
