Battery A Famous.
Battery A. of Rhode Island, a crack
light field artillery company, after 36
years of training, swung through El
Paso int? Fcrt Bliss late Thursday af
ternoon, finishing one of the longest
stretches of travel tnat militiamen,
coming to the border from all points of
the union, have experienced. The bat
tery detrained, pitched camp in Camp
John J. Pershing and. after & hearty
supper had been consumed, prepared to
spend a rrMful night on camp cots.
The organization of the battery A. of
Rhode Island, is renowned among- the
militia camps of the United States as
being one of the best groups of trained
artillerymen in the country. Battery A
was organized shortly after the Span
ish war. With its ups and downs of
militia existence it finall nassed to
f the command of Capt E. C Chaffee and
has since had a wholesome advance
ment with the result that it will prove
invaluable to the quota of artillery of
the regular United States army in the
event it is called upon
More Than War Strength.
When battery A received the call for
mobilization a week from Thursday
it was short 16 men of being up to war
strength. Now as the battery rests in
camp it has three more than needed to
bring it up to the war strength. A
large number of the members are ex
regulars. Many of the artillerymen are
graduates of Brown university at
Providence. The officers are profes
sional men. There are 174 enlisted men
and five officers in the battery.
The other officers of the battery are:
First Lieut. William Gamrael. jr.. IJeut
Gerald T. Hamley. Lieut. Donald S. Bab
cock. Lieut Harold R. Barker. Capt M
H. Merchant is in charge of the medi
cal corps.
Three Inch Ganx.
Excellent equipment accompanied the
Rhode Islanders besides the 86 first
class horses. There Is a fall comple
ment of 12 caissons and four three-inch
guns, one auto truck, three field service
wagons and a kitchenette, something
unique in the militia encampment Some
of the mounts that were brought along
with the battery are the choicest horse
flesh New England provides. Several
are valuable and have won race and
show honors. These were brought by
the officers.
The signal and field telephone and
telegraph corps are fully equipped and
Keyea up tor rirstciass service.
Another Battery forming.
Four troops of cavalry were left in
Rhode Island, it was announced, and
these besides the coast artillery forces
will remain until the call is issued for
them to come- to the border. Coincident
with the departure of battery A, veter
ans of the company started prepara
tions for organizing a battery B at
Providence. Rhode Island.
The usual shouts of militiamen who
greet all the girls, give cheers for El
Paso and otherwise make merry, re
gardless of whatever restraint an of
ficer attempts to make, was absent in
the Rhode Island train. Battery A was
easily the most orderly of all militia
men that have come to the city or
passed through en route to other points.
They happened to come on a track back
of other cars in the union depot and
missed the distribution of sandwiches,
oranges and other foods that the mem
bers of the Red Cross and Travelers'
