Of Small Incomes
Sentiment Grows in House for
Lowering the Standard of z
Exemptions.
Strong sentiment began to show Itself
In the House today for a change In the
Administration revenue bill whereby
men with smaller Incomes would be
taxed.
Congressman Hull, Tennessee, father
of the Income tax law, estimated that If
the exemption were reduced from H.oou
for married men, and 13,000 for slnglo
men, the $3,000 and $2,000, respectively,
M, 600,000 more could be collected. It
would atfTcct 300,000 more citizens,
Tho cry of "class legislation" has been
raised, but thus for the Admlnlstrntlon
leaders In charge of the bill have shown
no disposition to modify tho measure.
Congressman Longworth of Ohio, who
broko with the standpat Republicans
of the Ways and Means Committee and
voted to report the bill favorably, wants
smaller Incomes Included. He has gath
ered statistics to show England's ex
emption begins at IS0O and Germany's ex

STEPS TO PROTECT NATION
United States Authorities Move
to Check Spread of Malady
Throughout Country.
Fearing a possible nation-wide
epidemic of infantile paralysis, the
United States Public Health Serv
ice today took steps actively to aid
New York health officials in fight
ing the disease that already has
killed more than 165 New York
babies in less than a month.
The first step of Federal authori
ties in the battle against the dread
disease, it was announced today,
will be a visit of Assistant Surgeon
William Colby Rucker to New
York. Dr. Rucker will leave to
night to confer tomorrow with
Commissioner of Health Emerson,
of New York, and Surgeon C. H.
Lavinder, detailed at Ellis Island,
and who will have charge of the
health service staff in New York.
CALLS FOR REPORTS.
Dr. Rucker today telephoned to doc

their States.
Monkeys are needed Immediately for

telegraphed Dr. Rucker today Jthat 100
monkeys bolonglng to the Rockefeller In

Epidemic Expected to
Run Through Summer
NEW YORK. July 7. Overworked
board of health officials who have
been striving unsuccessfully tot kill
tho Infantile paralysis epidemic, ad
mitted today ther belief that the
scourage would prcbably continue
throughout the summer.
So virulent has been the outbreak of
the disease that none of the drastic
measures heretofore found effective
In dealing with it have served to stop
Its spread. The mortality continues
at about 24 per cent higher than
ever recorded in previous outbreaks
here.
"We have gone the limit In taking
every known precaution to prevent
the epidemic's spread," said Dr. Em
erson, health commissioner, "and yet
I have no confidence that we are
meeting with success. I look to see
tho outbreak continue throughout the

GO WHEN READY
Lessened Tension Doesn't Mean
District Militia Is to De
mobilize. Tho remaining District militiamen at
the mobilization camp near Fort Myer
will be sent to the Mexican border as
soon as they are ready, It was offi
cially stated at the war Department
today. This disposes of a rumor In
circulation at the mobilization camp
that, owing to the lessened tension in
the Mexican situation, the mllltla would
be demobilized without going to the
border.
Army officers said they hoped the na
tional guard officers and men would be
flven six months training on the border,
t will take six months of active service
with the regular troops to make the
guardsmen real soldiers, officers said
today.
Step Would Be Futile.
"It would bo the extreme of futility,"
an army officer said today, "to demobi
lize tho mllltla without sending it to
the txA-der. Tho Government has spent
"hundreds of thousands preparing the
guard for the Mexican campaign,
Whither the troops go Into Mexico or
not the training the guardsmen win
receive will bo of inestimable value to
the men as Individuals and to the na
tional guard as an organisation.
"Six months service on the border will
give the United States approximately
loo,f0 real soldiers who will be of In
estimable value In time of need."
Complete Training.
The only way the Government could
get Its money's worth out ot the mobi
lization, this officer said,. Is to tend the
men to the border and complete their
training.
The War Department had no means
of knowing today to what extent the
District national guard will be weakened
by the exemption of married soldiers.
No specific applications for exemptions
have been passed upon to this time,
officials said.
Adjutant General McCain sent out or
ders today calling out the regular army
reserve. The men forming the reserves
aro scattered In various parts of the
country. It will be some time before
the entire 4.000 or 6.000 available by this
order will be ready for duty on the

Gold Ring and Woman's Hatpin
and Torn Letter Only Clues
for Police.
Clarence Keefer, twenty-six
years old, was found dead in the
woods near Bunker Hill School
this morning, his body pierced by
two bullets.
Keefer some time ago received
an electric shock, which partially
paralyzed him and caused Kim to
be sent to the Government Hos
pital for the Insane for treatment.
Later he was paroled and was em
ployed as a watchman at Mt. Ver
non. The police believe that Keefer
was shot by a man who passed his
home, 1308 Michigan avenue
northeast, last evening about 9
o'clock with a girl.
FOLLOWED MAN AND GIRL.
Keefer was sitting on his porch when
the couple passed, headed for Lords'
woods. Keefer Jumped up and said he
was going to follow them. Ho was In
his stocking feet and hatless. His
mother. Mrs. B. E. Banflcld, remon
strated with him. but he kept on go
ing. This morning several persons in the
neighborhood told the police that they
heard two shots fired about 9:30 o'clock
last ovenlng. When Mrs. Banfteld
awoke this morning and found her son
had not returned she called up C. L.
Reiser, a fireman nt No. 6 Truck Com
pany in Park road. Reiser started, to
look for the body and found It In tho
woods about 100 yards from the road.
Kecfcr's body was lying face down
word In the bushes and each breast
was pierced by a bullet. It is believed
he died Instantly.

six rhlnestones. Around the woods
were ginger ale and beer botlea and
many old newspapers.
Coroner Novltt waa summoned, and
after his examination the body wm
taken to the morgue. The police say
Keefer was not armed whon he left the
house, and could hardly havo shot him
self anyway, because both hands had

nue. Keefer cut across a hill, and Is
believed to have met them as they
came Into the wood.
