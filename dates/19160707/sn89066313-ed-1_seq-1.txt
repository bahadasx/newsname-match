PARIS. Jul 7. The lull in the
fighting on the front on both sides
of the Somme. wheie the Allied offen
sive is under wav, continued through
out last night The war office to
da reported other points calm.
The night passed without an m
fantr fighting on the Verdun front al
so, though a violent bombardment
took place on the east side of the
Mouse in the region of Thiaumont.
In the Lc Petre wood, southeast of
Verdun, the Germans made an unsuc
cessful attack on French trenches
French grenadiers retaliated b clean
ing up a German front.
French militar critics this even
ing thought it probable that the lull
on the Somme front ma continue for
a few das, while the French organize
and prepare for a new attack b fresh
forces.
The open town of Lure, with about
six thousand inhabitants, near the
German lines in Upper Alsace, was
bombarder b a German air squadron
and eleven women and children were
killed and three wounded
