01110111 EASTWARD BOUND
Mr Huxsaw Writes Further of His
Impressions of the West
Marshall 111 Juno 27 1916
Editor Dispatch Arrived here Sun
day at 13 p m after a rather tire
some Journey of nonrlv srn miina nt
almost continuous travel and
iug as strong ns I wish I thought It
uuvisaoie to rest a few dajs before
continuing eastward On June 1G
I left San Francisco for Los Angeles
on board the largo ocean steamer
Congress that came wlthlA a few
hundred feet or striking the same rock
that destroyed the steamer Bear which
resulted In the loss of several lives
The fog not quite so dense the look
out or pilot on board the Congress
saw the rocks when thoy were a little
more man two hundred feet off ns
the boat was traveling slowly she suc
ceeded in backing away from the
danger and averting a disaster that
would probably have cost many lives
When we left San Francisco at 4 p
m the weather had cleared and the
sun shone brightly warming the at
mosphere which had been uncomfort
ably cool all day necessitating tho
wearing of overcoats and gloves which
I unfortunately did not have with me
for when I left Santa Clara alley at
S oclock In the morning the sun was
shining bright and the temperature
was quite warm There wero more
than six hundred passengers on bonrd
this massive vessel which Is more
than 500 feet long and I believe nearly
90 feet Wide and six decks deep
Among the passongers was a film
company that amused us considerably
with their work of film making In
Which they killed two persons not
dead and throw another overboard
He was later picked up b a passing
tUg that had been previously arranged
for We were also accompanied by
hundreds of sea gulls that followed us
all the way picking up any scraps of
food that were thrown to them Ev
eryone on board appeared to enjoy the
voyage hugely the water being quUe
smooth after leaving the Golden Gate
We traveled Within sight of land much
of tho time had all wo could eat
everything of superior quality good
beds and rocked in the cradle of the
deep we slept well Because of the
favorable condition of the weather we
nnived at our destination one hour
ahead of time in the beautiful harbor
of San Pedro passing several of our
Uncle Samuels war vessels at anchor
They had the appearance of being
ready for business when the proper
time arrives It was quite warm here
and wo left as soon as possible on tho
Pacific Electric Lines for Lo Angeles
where we arrived two hours leter and
found the city beautifully decotnted on
account of the Knights Tempers tri
ennial Conclave I witnessed several
pavades that wero grand especially
no Electric on Saturday evening
Whllo here I visited my brother Or
UIlos grnvw in Inglowood Park Cem
etery A Very beautiful spot of more
than three hundred acres located on
an elevation of nearly one hundred
feet ten miles northwest of Los An
geles While here I saw tho digging
of tho grave of Pat Crow near my
brothers resting place Crow of kid
naping fame requested that his re
mains be taken to California and laid
at rest in this beautiful spot Leav
ing ILos Angeles Monday evening on
tho Southern Pacific for San Jose I
traveled through some fine agricul
tural lands of Southern California
where I saw hundreds of acres of
fruit trees principally apple that
were propped roped and supported in
every conceivable manner because of
also passed many alfalfa and wheat
fields that promised big yields Ar
rived at San Jose at 745 where my
wife and daughter boarded tho traln
and we proceeded to Oakland where
wo arrived a few moments too late
to conenct with tho IMissourl Pacific
Overland for Eastern points necessi
tating a lay over until the morrow
the mountains and across small val
ley until it reaches tho plant where
with a drop of more than flvo hundred
feet it develops much power Con
tinuing on our Journey through this
canyon for more than one hundred
and fifty miles wo passed several gold
mining settleemnts and In ono of
them we saw two automobiles How
they got them no one could tell mc
since thl wa the first place that we
saw a road wider than a three foot
pack trail
Wo passed through more than fort
tunnels that were from 100 to BOO
feet in length and the last one being
nearly a mile long In this tunnel wo
were smoked like herrings The train
officials cnrelcssly leaving the venti
lators and many of the windows open
nearly suffocating Us At 10 p m wo
arrived in Partola elevation G000 feet
and quite cold and only 335 miles from
Frisco In this place last winter they
had six feet of snow and two feet of
ice Here I entered Into the land of
Nod and knew nothing more until
745 next morning when I awoke as
wo wcie passing throungh Elko Ne
vada
If I owned a farm of 40 or more
acres In Ohio 1 would not swap It for
tho whole of northern Nevada where
for three or four hundred miles I saw
only sand sage brush mountains
snow and at one place icicles hanging
from the side of a building where
some water had been spilled At one
small village we saw a number of
steaming hot springs and a great
many saloons surrounded with snow
covered mountains Traveling for
three or four hundred mile3 across
mountains and plains covered with
sage and brush occasionally seeing a
small settlement we finally came to
the Utah salt fields which we had
seen from a considerable distance
After a run of forty or fifty miles we
left the salt fields and crossed another
sand desert or more than ten miles
when wo camo to Great Salt Lake
traveling for several miles across one
end of it and experiencing the peculiar
sensation of a wheel ride on water
Wo arrived in Salt Lake City which
is built up close to the foot of a snow
capped mountain Hero I saw tho
first cgetation and timber that was
taller than a good sized bean pole
since leaving California The city and
Us people looked much ns they do In
any other large city of our land The
dwellings as a rule wero small onlj a
few of the older ones being largo
and having the appearance of being
enlarged from time to time as occas
ion might require After leaving Salt
Lake City wo journed through an ag
ricultural country for several miles
where wo saw wheat corn and veg
etation growlncj also some alfalfa and
other products We again found bur
solves In the mountains occasionally
traveing through small valley where
we frequently saw a log hut or several
of them their inhabitants in some
manner existing At 915 p in wo
reached tho top of the Wasatch Range
elovation 7490 feet Here sleep over
came me and I was pleased to see no
more of this uninviting desolate
country until next morning at 5 a m
when I awoke to nee a heavy frost
in the valleys and the mountains cov
ered with snow and the soil and con
ditions much as they were In Nevada
excepting that there were no saloons
Soon we came to tho Rio Grand river
which we followed for some distance
beyond Glen Wood -Springs passing
many fine farms on tho river banks
In a few hours we came to the Grand
Canyon passing the Belden Slfver
mine and mnnj otner mining inter
ests apparently in full operation It
was quite an interesting sight at tlmea
to see tho works and miners huts sit-
tho heavy load of ripening fmlt that lmted several housand feet above us
was bonding them to the ground I u Ulcsu perjwuuiuuiur JUouui
ain sides Emerging from tho can-
yonwo begun our climb toward Ten
nessee Pass or the Continental divide
elevation 10242 feet After several
hours travel through mountains and
elevated patches of small pine timber
drawn by two powerful engines doing
their very best we slowly pulled
tluougb the tunnel and found our-
This enabled us to see a few more of lves on tlle east or dow srade side
-Mm urffs in mni nrnnmi Rnn Fmn of Tennessee Pass To my right 1
Cisco The next morning at 945 wa beheld Mt Massive 14490 feet above
got away and arrived at Sacramento sea level Quite cool here snow all
at 2 p m Traveling through a low about us We also saw the source
level country of less than 40 feet ole of tho Arkansas river which was no
vation its Interests appeared larBr than the stream that flows
rally agricultural much wlieat being through Canfield following on the
grown Draylng and farming Is most- banks of tho Arkansas for possibly
ly done with mules I saw very few 0Il hundred and fifty miles we at
length entered tho Royal Gorge Here
horses Here my eyes or raUier a
new pair of glasses that I bought be
fore leaving San Joso played quite
a little joko on me Sitting In the
car reading a paper and glancing for
a moment out of the window my at
tention was directed to an old mule
and her colt that appeared grazing
nearby and a little farther off were
eight or ten more colts jumping about
This seemed so unusual that I took
off my glasses and Imagine my sur
prise when I saw that these colts were
all jack rabbits Do you wonder that
I was mistaken since their color was
tho same their ears nearly as long
and were the first Jack rabbits 1 ever
arT Wo learn by experience and I
will Know uetter next time
At 4 p m we arrived at Orville at
the mouth of the Feather Riyer cau
yon Here in times past considerable
gold has been mined the earth for
miles about having been turned and
left in heaps They still mine con
siderable wealth from tho pockets of
tourists by charging 10c for cones
50c the quart for coffee GOc a dozen
for dry buns and other things in pro
portion Passing into the mountains
wo saw the Feather river canyon iu
all is glory the wild rushing waters
of tho Feather river churned to foam
by tho huge rocks in the channel
which at times narrows to twenty
feet or less the perpendicular wall3
of tho canyon which at times slope
to a height of more than 3000 feet
fine timber covering them and snow
on their tops A mile or more up the
canyon we passed a large power plant
situated several hundred feet up on
tbe fountain side From here tho
power Is distributed over cables to
many parts of the state affording
cheap power for pumping water for
irrigating orchards and other products
Wo passed the intake for this plant
eleven miles up the diver frpra which
place tho water is carried through
tunnels and bug conduits through
everybody Is Invited to a seat on the
observation car attached to the rear
of tho train I did not Intend to avail
myself of this privilege realizing it
would be best for mo to remain on
the inside Ruth however was
anxious to go and requested my com
pany
The iRoyal Gorge In my estimation
Is not so much It Is very rocky
crooked and in places its sloping
walls are pretty high It is the way
they take you through it that makes
it terrible for some and to others fas
cinating After entering the gorge
they speed the train to thirty or more
miles per hour and Jn this way they
play crack the whip and the observa
tion car is the cracker and gives you
tho thrill of your life After passing
part way through tho gorgo they stop
examine the car and finding all o k
they proceed to give tho last and final
thrill Ituth and I did not stay for
more as one thrill of this kind was
enough for both of us I was about
as sick as I have ever been and lost
my appetite completely not regaining
It for several days My sickness saved
me conslderabe money as eats all
along the way wero mighty expensive
proving again tho old saying there Is
no loss but there Is also a gain At
Pueblo we changed to the Missouri
Pacific R R passing through an ag
ricultural country Alfalfa looks good
and tho second crop is now being har
vested wheat Is short and light with
grain oats six to 10 Inches high and
beading Saturday morning I awoke
in Central Kansas and looked upon
the beautiful sight of ripe fields of
wheat that had tbe appearance of be
ing at least 80 of a crop the 100
second crpp of alfalfa being harvested
the buridreds of acres of green corn
some ot It waist high and all of It
nearly knee high Oats while a bit
shorti were well headed the beautiful
and prosperous looking country end

substantial homes that met my view
in whatever direction I looked was
the most beautiful agricultural scene
1 believe I ever saw I also saw
many fine cattle and hogs Kansas a
indeed the picture of prosperity espec
ially tho central part At Hope wo
were detained three or four hours be
cause of a freight wreck lust ahead
of us when three box cars two tank
cars and a caboose were pretty badly
demolished and the track badly toca
up and several persons slightly in
jured A couple of days before a slm
liar accident occurred the same dis
tance the other sldo of Hope no one
being killed In eastern Knnaa nlanf
ing was delayed because of wet weath
er and crops did not look nearly so
well Some corn had just been plant
ed and much of It was only a couple of
Inches high was grassy and had a
poor color Especially at Ottawa was
this condition Here the river over
flowed destroying thousands of acres
of growing crops fields of wheat cov
ered with mud corn and grass being
also destroyed After traveling somo
distance we came to higher and moro
rolling ground passing many fino
herds of cattle also some fruit trees
Apples wero quite plentiful the first
I had observed since leavine Califor
nia In Colorado I saw a great many
fine looking trees but no apples and
I saw wholo orchards of fine young
trees that were being hewn down
therefore I Judged that these trees
were not good Colorado like Kansas
retains only that which is good tho
evil fruit and barren trees being dis
carded In eastern Kansas some clov
er and much timothy are grown but
very little alfalfa oak elm sycamore
and other timber of considerable size
Is also growing here We arrived In
Kansas City at 425 p m nearly
six hours late In Missouri corn looks
fine much of it nearly waist high
and present Indications point to a 100
per cent yield Wheat which Is nearly
all In shock GO to 70 Oats Is In
head and looks good Cattle hogs
and somo mules all In tho best of ord
er Missouri has been wonderfully
blessed this season with fine crops
also a warm climate In one small
town we passed through nearly tho
entire population was black It was
so hot hero and tho sun shone with
such an intense heat that I did not
wonder at tho dark complexion of Its
citizens
At Jefferson City I saw two men
pass the car window with fishing
tackle and a rope on which wero
strung all tho river fish they could
carry some of them moro than a foot
long This looked good to me and I
regretted I could not stop over and
try my luck Might again overtaking
us I took ono moro overland snoozo
until we reached St Louis at 130 a
m Just six hours -late mlsslne our
train and necessitating our going to a
hotel until next morning Here we
enjoyed a fine breakfast also saw
four deserters from the U S Army
in Mexico Jn custody of several dep
uty sheriffs They were chained to
geiher and to the wall of the room
A kind hearted elderly lady asked
them If they did not know -it was
wrong to shirk their duty to their
country In Its time of need One of
them replied ttladnin if you were In
Mexico and saw how careless them
greasers are with their guns and how
straight they can shoot you would de
sert too And I believe he was tell
ing more truth than poetry sinco
fighing is all tho Mexicans have been
doing for more than five yearn and wo
all know that practlco makes perfect
Many more of our fine young men
will realize that we have tackled a
nasty Job when hostilities havo actual
ly begUn Even tho politicians oppos
ing President Wilsons reelection may
be sorry they did not uphold him in
his policy of pcaco and prosperity
Why did they not howl and find fault
during Mr Tafts administration when
ho first American blood was shed on
account of the present difficulty with
Mexico The shoe was on the other
foot then and Mexico must work out
her own salvation Wlhilo now in tho
opinion of these greedy politicians it
Is wrong for a president to do all In
his power to keep his country in
peace which Mr Wilson is endeavor
ing by all honorable means at his
command to do Long may ho llvo
and prosper and If the worst comes
to pass may these calamity howling
war loving politicians all bo placed iu
the front ranks so they may serve
their country to their hearts content
by dying for it if need be to the ex
tent that many honorable peace loving
citizens might be spared for the good
ot their country
