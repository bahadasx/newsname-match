El Paso, Texas, July 7. Villa again looms up in the
Mexican situation, threatening Carranza's army in
northern Mexico. Unconfirmed reports to United States
officials here today declare the bandit leader himself is at
the head of over 2,000 men, in possession of Jiminez and
menacing Torreon, Gomez Palacio and other cities now
held by small Carranza garrisons.
Defeating several detachments of de facto troops
south of Parral, the rebels have been leaving a trail of
death and destruction in their wake, according to in
formation reaching state department agents.
As the Villista army advances northward hundreds
of recruits are said to be flocking to the bandit chief's
standards. If it be tine that Villa, once believed dead,
has recovered from his wounds and is leading the rebels,
officials fear that in a short time he may again have a
sufficient number of followers to challenge the large Car
ranzista army in Chihuahua state.
Government agents fear that Villa may soon approach
the American border. . " .
However, in circles friendly to Carranza it was
charged today that the reported reappearance of Villa is
a plot by interests who favor intervention and wish to
keep the American punitive expedition in Mexico.

May Job Carranza Forces In
Giving Battle to
Villa
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, July 7. General Persh
ing's punitive column will not only
remain within Mexico "for the time
being" but it may even be further
south to take a whack at the Villa band
reported to have practically annihilated
a Carranza garrison near Jiminez
Wednesday. This was learned on high
authority today following a formal no
tification of the Villista-success by
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo to the
state department.
Besides state department rumors of
Villa and Villistas moving northward
in considerable force, Secretary Baker
said this afternoon he had heard sim
ilar stories from border Bources. He had
not, however, received Arredondo's re
cital of the Corralito fight until he re
turned from the cabinet meeting.
The cabinet determined that the
border situation does not yet warrant
withholding any of the militia now in
state concentration camps or any pres
ent proposal for replaying militia by an
increase of the regular army.

London, . July 7. The new Russo

"Mutual consultation measures will
be taken with a view to support and
cooperation in the mutual safeguarding
and defense of those rights and inter
ests," the summary stated.
. The treaty further provides that
neither Japan nor Russia shall be a
party to any political arrangement or
combnintion against the other, The
purposes of the agreement, it is stat
ed, are to maintain lasting peace in the
Far East.

San Francisco, July 7. Tho price of

Would Remove Present

Causes of Border Trouble
By Bobert J. Bender.
(United Press staff co-respondent.)
Washington, Julv 7. Declaring "tho
government of the United States is pre
pared immediately to exchange views as
to a practical plan to remove finally
nnd prevent a recurrence of the diffi
culties which have been the cause of
controversy," Secretary of Htate Lans
ing dispatched to Mexican Ambassador
Arredondo today a reply to Ueneral
Carranza's note of July 4.
lhe American government comments
favorably in the note of the "frank
statement of the difficulties which
have unfortunately arisen," and ex
pressed gratification over the "unre
served expression of the desire of your
government to reach an adjustment."
Arredondo will immediately telegraph
the note to the Mexican foreign office,
and it is expected that he will at once
be instructed to begin the desired ne
gotiations with the state department.
Acting Secretary of State Polk will
conduct the negotiations for the depart- j
ment in the absence of Secretary Lans- j
ing, who leaves on bis vacation this aft-!
ernoon.
It is understood that a practical plan
already considered favorably by repre

is for a commission to study the whole

$100,000000 WOULD BE
NEEDED FOR THIS WORK
Nothing Can Be Done How
ever Until 'Government
Shows It Is Stable
. By Bobert J. Bender
(United Press staff correspondent)
Washington, July 7. President Wil
son proposes to allow General Carran-
7.1 himself to suggest the best means
by which this country can aid Mexico
to solve her difficulties. This, it was
stated today, is the most important
reature or . tne note Irom, . Secretary
Lansing to Mexican Foreign Secretary
Agunar, accepting tne latter s propos
al for direct . negafiations.
The note, in completed form, was
gone over ty tliftf president aud his
cabinet in a long session today. It
was expected, to be forwarded to Mex
ico City, by . Ambassador. Arredondo
before nigjt.
The session., was expected to mark
the second step by the president; in
working ont the Mexican question.
Primarily the cabinet had for con
sideration Secretary Lansing 'b formal
reply to Secretary Aguilur's pacific
note. This formally accepts the idea
of direct - negotiations and, it is. un
derstood, indicates the willingness of
this government to go a long way in
helping restore the. shattered republic.
Other problems of prime importance
before the cabinet were:
First, what is to be done about
guarding the border and permitting
Carranza to establish a parallel patrol
in cantonments on his side of the line.
' Second, what to do about sending
militiamen on the border to their
homes with the incidental increase, in
the regular army to fill their places. ,
' Third, and basically most import
ant, what to do ,to place Mexico on a
firm footing among the nations.
With respect to the latter, the ad
ministration feels that it cannot at
present encourage bankers to extend
aid in Mexico. lint it is hopeful Car
ranza can now take a strong guiding
hand which will ensure a stable gov
ernment ultimately and thus afford
the opportunity for American financial
aid.
One hundred million dollars, accord
ing to a high government official
would be the salvation of the stricken
nation, if it could be obtained upon
other than confiscatory terms. The
great fear is, however, that ' ' loan
sharks" may demand Mexico as their
collateral, a proposition which Carran-

scribe a note addressed to me by the
secretary of foreign relations of your
government, and to request that you
transmit to him the following reply:
" 'Mr. Secretary: I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your court
eous note transmitted to me by Seuor
Arredondo on the fourth instant, in
which you refer to my note of June 20
and June 25, and to assure you of the
sincere gratification of my government
that the frank statement of the diffi
culties which have unfortunately arisen
in our relations along the international
boundary and tho unreserved expression
of the desire of your government to
reach an adjustment o'f these difficul
ties on a broad and amicable basis. The
same spirit of friendship and of solici
tude for the continuance of cordial re
lations' between our two countries in
spired my government which equally
desires an immediate solution of the dif
ferences which have long vexed both
governments.
" 'It is especlclly pleasing to my
government that the de facto govern
ment of Mexico is disposed to give quick
as well as practical consideration" In a
spirit of concord to the remedies which
may be applied to the existing condi
tions. Reciprocating the same desire,
the government o the United States
is prepared immediately to exchange
views as to a practical plan to re
move finally and prevent a recurernre
of the difficulties which havo been the
source of controversy.'
" 'Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renew
ed assurance of my highest considera
tion. "I am. sir,
