Big Delegation From Vermont
Boards of Trade for the An
nual Meeting of The Greater
Vermont Association at
Montpelier
Reports received by The Greater
Vermont Association indicate that
the attendance at the annual meet
ing at Montpelier on July 12 and 13
will surpass the attendance at the
annual meetings in 1914 and 1915.
Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, and
Rutland expect to send parties of
fifty or more. Forty tickets to the
dinner have already been sold at
Bennington. The report from Lyn
donville several days ago was to the
effect that 18 tickets had already
been sold. The newly formed Board
of Trade at Brandon will send a party
of 25. Other boards are working on
plans to send from five to twenty-five
representatives.
The Association is urging every
community in the state to send dele
gates and thus to have a part in these
meetings and conferences which will
aim to speed up the "big drive" for
progress and development which is
on throughout the Green Mountain
state.
Vermont and the Chautauqua.
The Chautauqua idea is compara
tively new in Vermont. Many Ver
monters are from Missouri concern
ing the whole scheme. Some seem
to think it is a kind of cros? between
a campmeeting and a circus. My ob
servation has been that the good
Chautauqua towns have been the
towns where the community spirit
prevailed, and where the people
pulled together and loved each other
more or less.
The Chautauqua idea is still the
same idea originated by Bishop Vin
cent and expressed in the big insti
tution at Chautauqua Lake. All
Chautauquas are modeled after this
idea, although the business part is
worked out in different ways.
The Circuit Chautauquas, which
are the only ones Vermont has
known, come to the towns for six or
seven days instead of all summer,
and the business part originates with
the different Chautauqua Bureaus,
but they can be operated only with
the cooperation of the communities.
There is a purpose in the Chautau
qua idea other than mere money get
ting, borne of the organizations
have the purpose distinctly stated in
the charter.
The Lincoln Chautauquas were
started with the express purpose of
promoting National Prohibition of
the liquor traffic, and it was so
stated in the charter. The general
purpose of most of them is, I think,
to develop a healthy community
spirit, that makes for the growth of
the towns. One expressed this pur
pose: To enable the people of the
towns and cities to regulate the
leisure hours of the citizens.
In my work for the Redpath Chau
tauquas, I have found all connected
with the institution to be fine up
standing people to meet. The "crew
boys" that look after the big tent
and see to the comfort of the audi
ence are mostly college boys, spend
ing their vacations this way. The
platform managers are school princi
pals, also putting in the summer
time on the circuit. So the Chau
tauqua brings a nice, clean set of
people to the towns. In at least one
company, not even smoking is
allowed on the Chautauqua ground
and if any one connected with the
organization is seen entering a sa
loon, it is sufficient ground for dis
charge. The people who are inter
ested in the uplift and the welfare
of the communities usually are
Chautauqua boosters.
The Circuit Chautauquas have
flourished in the Middle West. Ver
monters are excellent people down
deep in their hearts, but their spirits
do not gush to the surface and over
flow in friendliness to each other in
quite the western way. The Chau
tauqua helps to cultivate the "Ev
erybody get together and pull to
gether" spirit, so I hope Vermont
will welcome the Chautauquas, and
not freeze them out.
Possibly a few words from Ed
ward Amherst Ott's speech in re
sponse to the address of welcome to
the Woodsville, N. H., Chautauqua
may not be amiss in closing.
"Chautauqua is a movement, not
an institution. You cannot see it
with the eyes. It is not a tent and
a canvas fence. Our battle line is
far Hung. In more than three thou
sand places the greater canvas tops
will be lifted, and in every state the
people will gather to hear and listen
and respond to the spirit of this free
pulpit. Growing out of our democ
racy this movement is the most dem
ocratic thing in America.
For over a century we have been
trying this experiment of a republic,
but most of our institutions are not
democratic. They do not express
the republic. We have schools and
colleges, but the management is not
democratic. Their p'ans are bor
rowed from the old world, and carry
the faults of world old errors. Fur-
tnermore, tney are provincial in a
sad way. Each one has its own tra
ditions, and is proud to maintain
them. To one who visits many col
leges each year, and talks with stu
dents and teachers, the local nature
is very apparent.
"Provincial leaders make provin
cial hearers. The man who address
es crowds in California one month,
and audiences in Maine the next and
visits all the states each year, cannot
well maintain local viewpoints, and
local idiosyncrasies become amusing
to him. He ceases to care for the
little things; he sees the unity of life
and becomes cosmopolitan in mind
and heart.
"This free pulpit has done much
good, but perhaps the greatest good
is that it has made a new set of
teachers. On this platform sectarian
preachers have ' become religious
leaders, and partisan politicians have
become statesmen."
