On account of lack of interest
among tre cattlemen of this county
there was not enougl nignatures se
cured to the petition asking that the
work be taken up for the county
commissioners to act upon the ques

have to be deferred until' another
year. Many of the cattlemen were
sorely disappointed over the turn of
affairs and they were heard to re
mark that they would install dipping
vats of their own before they would
take chances on loosing cattle by the
ticks. The petition should have been
presented to the board of county

INDIAN MAN
INS BIG SUIT
ON OIL LAND
RAYSON WESLEY LANDS THAT
WILL GIVE UP A QUARTER OF
A MILLION IN WEALTH SOLD
FOR $10,000.
This morning in district court Ihe
case of LoulHa 'Wesley vs.'TIunvsoii
et al., was up for final hearing and
resulted in a victory for the plaintiff.
This was one of the most Important
suits ever tried here as it invclwd
some of the richest deposits in the
Ifealdton field and is n di.-ninet vic
tory for Attorney J. I?. Moore, and
Geo. V. Short, counsel for the plain
tiff. The land involved is situated
in sections 3 and 10 and consisted of
130 acres. Leases had been secured
from the allottee prior to his death
by the Gates Oil company and othe
by the Gates Oil company and other
companies in which it was stipulated
that ose eightr of the oil secured
was to go as a royalty to the lessor.
At the time the contract was made
there were six producing wells on the
property producing 2100 barrels of
oil daily, the royalties from the six
original wells was bringing in ap
proximately three thousand dollars
per month. V. II. Thompson secur
ed from Louisa Wesley, alleged to
be old and incompetent Indian an as
signment of this royalty for the pay
ment, of ninety dollars per month
for ten years and a cash bonus of
three hundaed dollars.
The court found this morning
that the consideration was grossly
inadequate that iouisa Wesley yas
wholly incompetent; and that the
terms of the contract were never ex
plained to her by the interpreter or
any one In her behalf, that there was
not a meting of the minds as be
tween her and Thompson, that she
did not know what she was doing
when she executed the contract and
if she had any Idea at all she
thought she was making a lease, he
further found that the county court
did not comply with the mandates
of the law in that the order was
mado without taking any testimony
and the deferred payments were not
secured by mortgage as required by
the statutes.
In view of the fac) that there were
six producing wells and six others
in course of drilling and that 90
acres of the land was in proven ter
ritory the court held that the prop
erty at the time of the assignment
was worth at least fifty thousand dol
lars. The property today is considered
some of the most valuable in the
Ilealdton field.
The suit has attracted widespread
attention among the oil operators all
over the state on account of the value
of the property and the terms under
rfhich the assignment of the royal
ties were secured,.
Thomas Norman of this city was ap
pointed by the court last November
to take charge of the money obtained
from the sale of oil from the Wesley
lands and as a result he has about
I21.O00 in rash to be turned over to
the departmeut to her credit.
