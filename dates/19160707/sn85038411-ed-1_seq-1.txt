sive; Violent Artillery Actions Around Verdun
A German retreat all along the line of the front in Russia from
Riga to Volhynia is reported to-day.
The unofficial news to this effect comes from Petrograd through
Rome. It declares that a triple defeat for the Germans in the Riga,
Kolki and Baranovichi sectors caused them to begin a movement
of their whole front westward.
Petrograd has recently announced successes in the regions
mentioned in the Rome advices. The last report from the vicinity
of Kolki, in the crucial Volhynia sector, recorded the capture by the
Russians of more than 7500 prisoners, half a dozen cannon and 23
machine guns.
A great battle is raging along virtually the entire front of the
British offensive in Northern France.
British Launch New Drive
At daybreak the British launched a new drive east of Albert.
Important tactical successes were gained in several sectors, London
announces.
The Germans simultaneously attacked in force near the river
Ancre and north of Fricourt. They succeeded in temporarily oc
cupying two or three hundred yards of ground lost in the earlier
British drive.
Capture Long Trench
Advantages gained by the British were in the vicinity of
Ovilleres, Contalmaison and La Boisselle. Near the last named
place in an engagement last night a German trench more than a
half mile in length was captured.
Counter Attacks Futile
Meanwhile the French, both north and south of the Somme in
the field of the great allied offensive, are resting on the ground won
in their notable advances of the last week. Efforts of the Germans
to break the line now held by the French before Peronne. at one
point with 2j4 miles of that city, have been futile according to
Paris.
There is a comparative lull in the fighting about Verdun so far
as the infantry is concerned, but artillery actions on the right bank
of the Meuse, north of the citadel, are still violent.
Germans Admit Retreat
Berlin, July /. via London.—A salient of the German line in
Volhynia projecting towards Czartorysk has been abandoned under
