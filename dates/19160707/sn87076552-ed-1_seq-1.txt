ed its scrutiny of the returns of the

the citizens of the various townships
and villages are now available- .
For Amboy township the assessors
returns for 1915 was $317,670, and
for 1916, $293,710. These figures show
a decrease of $23,960 but a portion of
this amount is transferred to the
valuation of Incorporated companys
and is not a loss at all; in addition to
this the Board of Revision added to
th assessor's returns $11,430 bringing
the totat valuation lor 1916 up to!"""""" ."' ""-"
$305,140 which with the transf er 1
mentioned in the foregoing makes
mail gain instead, of a loss.
Royalton township returned in 1915
$184,450 in personal property and
this year the assessors, returned $193,
120 a gain of $8670, the board of re

turns. ,

700; the returns last year being. $180,
600 and this year $201,300.
Gotham shows a decrease of fsioo
The assessor last year returning a
valuation of $406,960 while the 1916
assessor found only $401,860; the de
crease was occasioned by removals
from the township.
Franklin assessor returned $410,260
against the return of $427,890 last
year. The board of revision added
$13760 making a total $424,020 leaving

vision have added the sum of $14,620

leaves a loss in this township of $13,
07' The only reason that can be as
signed for this decrease is that the
assessment in Fulton township last
year was too high. .

reduction. The valuation for this
township last year was $243,430 this

the Assessor's returns. In 1915 the
valuation was $491,000 and 1916
$463,610; with the addition by the
Board of Revision the total this year
is $464,610 a decrease of $26,390- This
decrease is explained in part at least
by the 1916 Assessor reporting that
he found parties whose personal val
uation in 1915 included mortgages
which were held against the property
returned for taxation and the amount
of which should be deducted from
their total valuation.
. Clinton increased its valuation this
year $45,190. In 1915 the valuation

ROAD LEVIES NECESSARY
In order to protect the good roads
interests of a county it is practically
necessary, says the Ohio Good Roads
Jusl en ls,8uea 10 county omciais,
for the board of county commissioners
to provide three distinct county road
levies. This is due to the rather
peculiar provisions of the Cass High
way Law, bounded upon the sugges
tion that construction and maintenance
be kept separate and apart.
If any of the three levies are neg
lected it may cause trouble in co
operating with the State Highway
Department in maintenance and re
pair or roads. This does not neces
sarily mean that the county's levies
must be large but that three distinct
funds must be created. There are
two levies which are strictly county
affairs but a third is that which fur
nishes the funds for the county to
co-operate with the state.
For the purpose of paying the1
county's share of the cost of con
structing, improving, maintaining,
dragging and repairing roads by the
county commissioners levies may be
made under Section 105 of the Cass
Law, which is known as Section 6926
of the General .Code. The commis
sioners may also levy under Section
238 of the Cass. Law, known as Sec
tion 6956-1 of the General Code.
While levies may be made under both
sections, it is mandatory to raise a
maintenance fund of at least $20 a
mile.
Under Section 215 of the Cass Law,
or Section 1222 of the General Code,
the levy is made to enable the county
to co-operate with the state. The
safest pUin for the counties is to avail
themselves of the power given by all
three sections, says the Good Roads
Federation in urging that the next
year's r6ad program be the greatest
in the history of the state.

Some months ago Mr. and Mrs.
Leroy Whittecar went to California
on account of Mr. Whittecar's health
and they have made their home at
Littlelands in that State.

fowls by sifting the powder in the
feathers, between the legs, under the

A SPECIALIST AT YOUR FARM
How can the farmer use the manure
and lime on his own farm temporarily
to offset the use of potash which is
almost prohibitive in price? This is
the problem which the College of Agri
culture, Ohio State University is
helping the farmers of the state to
solve. , Fertilizer meetings in which
a soil specialist from the University
visits farms and points out how the
farmer can successfully maintain his
yields without potash are now being
scheduled. Any reader of this paper
can arrange to have one of these meet
ings on his own farm by writing to
Clark S. Wheeler, Ohio State Uni
versity, Columbus.

possible. , Do not turn the hose on
him-
6. Saturday night, give a bran
mash, lukewarm; and add a table
spoonful of saltpetre.
7. Do not use a horse-hat, unless
it is a canopy-top hat. The ordinary
bell-shaped hat does more harm than
good.
A sponge on top of the head,
or even a cloth, is good if kept wet.
If dry it is worse than nothing- -
9. If the horse is overcome by
heat, get him into the shade, remove
harness and bridle, wash out his
mouth, sponge him all over, shower
his legs, and give him two ounces of
aromatic spirits of ammonia, or two
ounces of sweet spirits of nitre, in a
pint of water; or give him a pint of
coffee warm. Cool his head at once,
using cold water, or, if necessary,
chopped ice, wrapped in a cloth.
10. If the horse is off his feed, try
him with two quarts of oats mixed
with bran, and a little water; and add
a little salt or sugar. Or give him
oatmeal gruel or barley ; water to
-drink.
11. .Watch your horse- It he stops
sweating suddenly, or if he -breathes
short and quick, or if his ears droop,
or if he stands with his leg3 braced
sideways, he is in danger of a heat
or sun stroke and needs attention at
once. '
12. If it is so hot that the horse
sweats in the stable at night, tie him
outside, with bedding under him. Un
less he cools off during the night, he
cannot well stand the next day s heat.

Traveling Man's Experience. 1 -"In
the summer of 1888 I had a very
severe attack of cholera morbus. Two
physicians worked over me from four
a. m. to six p. m. without giving me
any relief and then told me they did
not expect me to live: that 1 had best
telegraph for my family. Instead of
doing so, I gave the hotel porter fifty
cents and told rum to buy me a bot
tle of Chamberlain's Colic. Cholera
and Diarrhoea Remedy, and take no
substitutes. 1 took a double dose ac
cording to the directions and went to
sleep after the second dose.' At five
o'clock the next morning I was called
by my order and took a train for my
next, stopping point, a well man but
feeling rather shaky from the sever
ity of the attack," writes H. W. Ire

FOURTH OF JULY TETANUS
Back in 1905 there were 104 deaths
in -the United States from Fourth of
July tetanus, this figure representing
about' the average annual mortality.
In 1914, as a result of the institution
of batter prohylactic treatment by
physicians and the widespread agita
tion for a safe and sane Fourth, the
number was reduced to 3. A year
ago the U. S. Public Health Service
expected and predicted that every
youngster in the United States would
be safe from this disease, basing its
estimate on what had already been
accomplished. When the returns came
in it "Was found that a boy down in
Maine had been injured, developed te
tanus and. died. That single fatality
was- only one among severs hundred
thousand occuring in the United States
during 1915 but it resulted from
Fourth of July tetanus or lockjaw, a
preventable disease, and was there
fore an unnecessary death. The loss
of this boy makes it necessary to
again disseminate information regard
ing this wholly avoidable infection.
The blank cartridge wound is the
great cause of Fourth of July tetanus,
but injuries from crackers and fire
arms are at times responsible. - When
driven into the tissues -the -wadding
carries with it innumerable bacilli. If
these be tetanus bacilli the poisonous
-products or toxins resulting from
their multiplication produce the dis
ease.' Tetanus bacilli thrive only in
the absence of oxygen.'' It is for this
reason that the physician enlarges the
wound of entrance and after removing
all foreign material dresses the in
jury in such a manner that develop
ment of the organisms is inhibited. In
order to accomplish this it is usually
necessary to administer an anaaethetic
Anti tetanic serum is of great value
as a prophylactic and it should in
variably be given in injuries of this
character. .
Parents should realize that Fourth
of July tetanus is easy to prevent but
extremely difficult to cure, the dis
ease being attended with a mortality
of more than 95 per cent. No blank
cartridge wound is too trivial to re
ceive careful medicial attention. How
ever slight the injury may appear
summon a competent physician who
will at once institute the necessary
propylatic measures.' Reliance iroon
home treatment may prove disastrous
and result in the needless, sacrifice of
life. . . .. ' -. . -
