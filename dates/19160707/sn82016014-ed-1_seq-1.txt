New Orleans, July 7. More than
eighty persons are Missing, according
to reports reaching here at 7 o'clock
this morning, from various sources.
The radio to Mobile and Pensacola
was working fairly well at this hour
and it is thought the loss from Thurs
day's hurricane will be known some
time this afternoon.
Pensacola reported only slight prop
erty damage. The loss at Biloxi,
mostly in the residential section, is
estimated at more than J.200,000.
Eleven fishing parties which departed
for various islands Wednesday and
Thursday were still unheard from and
it is feared they have perished.
Many ships are missing today. The
Frieda, Captain Wiick. with a crew
of twenty-one, New Orleans to Pro

it is feared she went down. A schoon

of six men each were missing. These
boats put out Wednesday evening.
First Word From Mobile.
Mobile, Ala., July 7. Gale-stricken
Mobile got its first word to the outside
world today since Wednesday. Heavy
damage was done by the gulf storm
to sailing craft and steam vessels in
the harbor.
Four persons, two of them white.
are known to have been drowned. It
is feared others may have perished.
The damage throughout the city
may not exceed $250,000. This damage
consisted largely of roofs whipped
from dwellings and office buildings
at the height of the blow. .Railroad
service into the city is still paralyzed.
Railroad officials admitted this morn
ing it may be twenty-four hours be
fore damage can be repaired and ser
vice resumed.

Montgomery. Ala., July 1. The gulf
storm hat has wreaked havoc in many
gulf coast cities in the past forty-eight
hours was apparently centering inland
in the vicinity of Vlcksburg, Miss.,
early toda.y. Reports began to come
in to Montgomery of the damage done
at Pensacola, Mobile and various
smaller cities-. No loss of life has been
reported but the property loss will
reach hundreds of thousands, the wa
ter front having been hit hardest in
each of the two cities. Mobile, alone,
it is said, has suffered $1,000,000 dam
age. An unverified report from Beloit,
Ala., told that seventeen negroes had
been killed and others Injured.
For a time it was evident that Mo

station at Mobile was put out of com
mission by the wind at the same time
telegraphic communication with the
rest of the state was cut off.

LANSING'S NOTE
TO PREVENT WAR
TO MEX. TODAY
Carranza's Proposal of Direct
Mediation Accepted.
Would Reach Settlement on an
Amicable Basis.
BORDER WAR UNFORTUNATE
Secretary of State Pleased With
Mexican Attitude.
Would Prevent a Recurrence of
the Difficulties.
Washington, July 7. A note for
mally accepting General Carranza's
proposal that differences between the
United States and the de facto gov
ernment of Mexico be settled by direct
negotiations was handed today to
Eliseo Arredondo. the Mexican ambassador-designate.
Secretary Lansing took a draft of
the note to today's cabinet meeting
and had it delivered promptly after
the cabinet adjourned. The course
to be pursued already has been agreed
upon by President Wilson and his ad
visers. The Note.
The text of the note, addressed to
Mr. Arredondo, follows:
"Sir: 1 have the honor to ac
knowledge the receipt of your com
munication of July 4, 1916, in which
you transcribe a note addressed to
me by the secretary of foreign rela
tions of your government and to re
quest that you will transmit to him
the following reply:
"Mr. Secretary: I have the honor
to acknowledge the receipt of your
courteous note transmitted to me by
Senor Arredondo on the 4th instant
in which you refer to my notes of
June 20 and June 25 and to assure
you of the sincere gratification of my
government at the frank statement of
the difficulties which have unfortu
nately arisen in our relation along
the international boundary, and the
unreserved expression of the desire of
your government to reach an adjust
ment of these difficulties on a broad
and amicable basis. The same spirit
of friendship and of solicitude for the
continuance of cordial relations be
tween our two countries inspires my
government which equally desires an
immediate solution of the matters of
difference which have long vexed
both governments.
Ready to Mediate.
"It is especially pleasing to my gov
ernment that the de facto government
of Mexico is disposed to give quick as
well as practical consideration in a
spirit of concord to the remedies
which may be applied to the existing
conditions. Reciprocating the same
desire, the government of the United
States is prepared immediately to ex
change views as to a practical plan to
J remove finally and prevent a recur
rence of the difficulties which have
been the source of the controversy.
"Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed
assurances of my highest considera
tion.. "I am sir, yours very sincerely,
(Signed) "ROBERT LANSING."
Polk Will Aft for C S.
The proposed change of views prob
ably will be carried on through in
formal conversations between Mr. Ar
redondo and Counceller Polk, who will
act as secretary of state during the
next month. Secretary Lansing leaves
today to spend his vacation at Water
town. N. T. He will, however, keep
in close touch with the department.

is not known when the murders took

El Paso, Tex., July 7. Villa again

OUR
United States officials here today de
clare the bandit leader himself is at
the head of oer 2,000 men, in pos

state department agents. As the Vil
lista army advances northward hun
dreds of recruits are said to be flock

Border May Be His Goal.
If true that Villa, once believed
dead, has recovered from his wounds
and is leading the rebels, officiate
fear that in a short time he may
again have a sufficient number of
followers to challenge the large Car
ranza army in Chihuahua state.
Government agents fear Villa may
soon approach the American border.
However, in circles friendly to Car
ranza. it was charged today that the
reported reappearance of Villa is a
plot by interests who favor interven
tion and wish to keep the American
punitive expedition m Mexico.

Mexican snipers secreted in a clump

were not returned.
The body of Capt. Charles Boyd

tified the state department that a
large Villa band attacked the Car
ranza garrison at Corelitos, near Jim

almost destroying it. Fearing the
bandits might take to the desert. Car
ranza has asked the state department
to have the American border watched
on the American side - between Bou

Carranza has promised to do his
utmost on the Mexican side to inter
cept such an attempt, if made. In
order to avoid delay, the embassy tele

Republican Nominee May Be in
Topeka Next Month.
Kansas Leaders Plan State
Wide Meeting Soon.
SCENE OF HARMONY SESSION
If Candidate Comes, Love Feast
May Be Held.
Progressives and Republicans
Could Bury Hatchet.
Charles Evans Hughes, Republican
nominee for president, may speak in
Topeka in August. That is a plan be
ing worked out by Republican leaders
in Kansas. Under the plan the former
supreme court Justice may stop In To
peka on his way from Denver to Kan
sas City when he invades the west
next month.
No definite details of Judge
Hughes's plans have been received by
Kansas Republicans. It Is known,
however, that the presidential nomi
nee will leave New York next month
for a five or six weeks' western tour.
IN E I G H B O R
fOUwrlsHt! IMS:
Plans so far announced include a
speech in Denver with a second speech
in Kansas City. It is believed that Re
publican campaign managers may be
Induced to provide for at least one
speech in Kansas. If this state is giv
en a speech, Topeka will most likely
land it, although Salina Republicans
have sought the date.
D. W. Mulvane, former Republican
national committeeman, stated today
that he believed there was a strong
chance to secure a Hughes meeting in
Topeka if the Kansas City date be held
on the presidential candidate's itin
erary. The question of a Topeka
meeting will be presented to national
leaders in charge of Judge HuBhes's
speaking engagements.
Still in the Air.
"The date of Judge Hughes's Kansas
City meeting is so indefinite, at this
time, that it is impossible to foresee
the success Kansas would have in an
effort to bring him to Topeka," said
Mulvane. "If the Kansas City speech
be assured, I am quite certain Kansas
will get at least one speech. The mat
ter will doubtless be presented to the
speaking committee at an early date.
But until some definite program is
outlined, it is hard to determine our
success."
One announcement sent from the
Hughes headquarters is to the effect
that Judge Hughes will travel only on
regular trains. This plan includes a
jump from Denver to Kansas City
over the Union Pacific. No rear plat
form speeches are to be included in
the trip and the presidential candidate
is said to have asked to be assigned
not more than two speeches a day.
With a Denver-Kansas City jump,
however, it is believed that Topeka
win lana a speecn. t
In event the presidential candidate
is brought to Topeka. members of the
Republican state committee and party
leaaers win seeK to make the meeting
the banner attraction of the campaign
in this state. With Hughes as an at
traction it is probable that Repub
licans and Progressives would stage a
big harmony meeting in Topeka. Mul
vane and other men prominent in the
affairs of the Republican party in
Kansas will work with Fred E. Stan
ley of Wichita, present national com
mitteeman, in an effort to land the
Hughes meeting. The matter will be
Dresented to the national inmmitf
heads in advance of the preparation of t

BY ROBERT J. BENDER.
Washington, July 7. The American-Mexican
situation today had
changed from one that contemplated
war to one contemplating rehabilita
tion of Carranza's country.. How to
bring peace and prosperity out of the
Mexican chaos was the problem before
T O THE SOUTH
Br Mm T. MoObtatx-oo.l
President Wilson and his cabinet.
The session was expected to mark
the second step by the president in
working out his Mexican policy.
Primarily, the cabinet had'for con
sideration Secretary Lansing's formal
reply to Secretary Aguilar's note. This
formally accepts the idja of direct ne
gotiations, and it was understood, in
dicates the willingness of this govern
ment to go a long way in helping re
store the shattered republic.
Problems Before Cabinet.
Other problems of prime importance
before the cabinet were:
First What is to be done about
guarding the border and permitting
Carranza to establish a partial patrol
In cantonments on his side of the line.
Second What to do about sending
militiamen on the border to their
homes with the incidental increase in
the regular army to fill their places.
Third And basically most import
ant, what to do to place Mexico on a
firm footing among the nations.
Can't Encourage Bankers.
With respect to the latter, the ad
ministration feels that it cannot at
present encourage bankers to extend
aid to Mexico. But it is hopeful Car
ranza can now take a strong guiding
hand which will ensure a stable government-
ultimately and thus afford
the opportunity for American financial
aid.
One hundred million dollars, accord
ing to a high government official, would
be the salvation of the stricken nation,
if it could be obtained upon other than
confiscatory terms. The great fear is,
however, that "loan sharks" may de
mand Mexico as their collateral a
proposition which Carranza would
heartily reject and which the admin
istration will not support.
To encourage Carranza in establish
ing his government and to work out a
scheme of financial assistance which
will not extort blood money from Mex
ico, was the big administration prob
lem. IDEAL SUMMER DAYS

Berlin, via London, July 7. The
military correspondent of the Zeitung
Am Mittag, commenting on the war
situation, writes:
"The fighting on all fronts is in
creasing in extent and violence. The
enemv everywhere is attempting to
throw fresh troops into the struggle,
which seems to be approaching nearer
and nearer its maximum Intensity.
The mightiest exertions are being
made on all sides to force a decision
and the tension can scarcely become
higher."
After summarizing numerous offi
cial reports the correspondent con
tinues: "It still is too early for a final ver
dict upon the situation as the strug
gles on the principal fronts still are
in progress. The Germans, however,
report to have been able to hold up
the enemy's advance on the west as
well as on the south and east. Neither
the British, French, Russians nor
Italians have attained large or decisive
successes, while in places where the
central powers have assumed the of
fensive, as in Volhynia, other opera
tions have been conducted with suc
cess. Teutons Have Assurance.
"This success enables us to look for
ward with certain amount of assur
ance and with calm confidence to fur
ther developments of the fighting.
We do not dare, however, to overlook
the fact that our opponents are mak
ing mighty efforts and are throwing
in all available forces to attain suc
cess. Our troops on all the fronts are
faced by numerically superior forces
and therefore are conrronted with the
prospect of further heavy fighting."
The correspondent devotes consid
erably more space to the combats on
the east than on the west, declaring
that the Russian attacks against Field
Marshal Von Hindenburg, Prince Leo
pold and Count Von Bothmer gave
every evidence from the masses of
troops employed that an offensive on
a larger scale is contemplated. He
adds that the fighting along Von Hin
denburg's front is still in progress but
asserts that the attack against Prince
Leopold's armies appears to have been
i finally and decisively repulsed with
I the heaviest losses.
j The fighting continues on the upper
Stripa, he says, and the Russians
were able to cross the river : nd gain
!a foothold in one place but the counter
attack already has begun. The Rus
sians were thrown back in Volhynia
and on the Stripa front, he concludes,
and the victory at Tlumach, south of
the Dneister, is increasing in extent.

HAD LONG JOY RIDE
Record Shows J. J. King's Stolen Car
Was Driven 500 Mites.
George Lauman, brought back from
Kansas City Thursday night by Sheriff
L. Kiene, admitted on the way
home, Kiene said today, that he stole
J. J. King's Ford last Sunday night.
He was caught in the car by Kansas
City police, because he and three com
panions insisted upon discharging
firearms while driving along the
peaceful boulevards.
Lauman was arraigned in the court
of Topeka today and after the state's
evidence had been taken waived the
remainder of the preliminary. He will
be tried, not on the charge of stealing
the King car, but upon a burglary
charge brought more than a month
ago. He was out on a $500 bond when
he disappeared with the car.
In his conversation with Kiene,
Lauman stated that there were three
other men with him when he took
the car: that they first drove to Wa
mego, then on to Manhattan. The
Fourth they drove back to Topeka.
He said he spent the night here and
drove to Kansas City July 5.
J. J. King, owner of the car, went
to Kansas City to drive it home. Mrs.
King went with him and they ex
pected to have a nice night ride home.
They found the car in bad shape.
Temporary repairs were made in Kan
sas City and they started home be
fore dark. They reached Topeka after
daylight today and stopped at every
repair shop along the road.
The speedometer showed the car
had been driven about 500 miles from
the time it was stolen until it was re
covered. MORE KANSANS GO

London, July 7. British troop
have captured 1,000 yards of German
trenches in severe fighting east of La
Boisselle, (east of Albert) General
Haig reported this afternoon. The
gain is one of the most important ad
vances scored by the British since the
first day of the allies great offensive.
Severe fighting is going on in the
La Boisselle sector, Haig reported.
The Germans have suffered heavy
losses.
"Southwest of Thiepval a de
termined enemy attack was complete
ly repulsed," reported the British
commander-in-chief.
Germans Counter Attack Vigorously.
The British gain east of La BoisselU
is of particular importance because It
links up with the eastward advance of
the French north of the Somme. The
Germans had massed large forces on
this sector and counter-attacked des
perately in efforts to fling back the
British line.
The statement follows:
"This morning in certain sectors of
the battlefield east of Albert, we re
sumed a vigorous offensive at dawn.
The Germans at the same time launch
ed heavy attacks on our new trenches
in the vicinity of Ancre and north of
Fricourt, with the result that violent
fighting is now In progress along the
whole front between the Ancre and
Montauaban.
Up to the present several impor
tant tactical successes have been gain
ed by our infantry in the vicinity of
Ovillers, La Boisselle and Contalmal
son, but northwest of Thiepval the
enemy succeeded temporarily in re
gaining two or three hundred yards
of lost ground." -"
French Wins Gallant Victories.
Paris, July 7. The solidity of the
French conquest In Picardy at last
has been put to the test and military
men here say it has come out of the
ordeal with flying colors.
The Germans who managed to gath
er considerable forces, partly, appar
ently from the British front where the
pressure was lessened during the day
and partly from depots, delivered a
series of violent attacks on two points.
The first of these was between Hem
and Maricourt on the Clery road. The
second was on the extreme right be
tween Estrees and Belloy, the object
being to drive a wedge between the
French center and right where the
French line crosses the Somme river
from Hem to Fueilleres and between
the extreme right and the rest of the
French front.
The success of these maneuvers
would have forced the eventual retire
ment of the whole French line. The
German reaction, however, came too
late.
The French had time thoroughly to
strengthen their line, to advance and
place in position heavy artillery and to
bring up plentiful stocks of munitions.
Consequently the attacking wave was
caught in a whirlwind of machine gun
fire from the trenches and was shot
to pieces by the "seventy-fives" while
the German supports following and
reserves far in the rear were shattered
by salvos from medium and heavy bat-,
teries.
Two and Half Miles From Peronne.
The German infantry plodded for
ward again and again but nowhere,
French reports say, made any Impres
sion upon the French lines.
Rarely even did they get to grips
with the occupants of the trenches.
This accounts for the small number of
prisoners taken. -
The Germans, says the report, had
striven the whole day. without effect
ing the slightest modification of the
situation.
The French remain two and a half
miles from Peronne on the south side
of the Somme and four miles from
that city on the north side of the river.
There are no formidable natural ob
stacles in the way of their occupation1
of the city when the French com-
mander judges that the time is ripe
to do so.
