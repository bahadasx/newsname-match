Would Exclude Whisky Ads. From
the U. S. Mails.
There is a law in this State
prohibiting whisky advertise
ments in the newspapers and, also
the sale of periodicals containing
such advertisements on the news
stands. While this is true, such
periodicals are delivered through
the U. S. mails. When the post
office appropriations bill was be
ing considered by the Senate,
June 28th, the following remarks,
made by Senator James K. Var-
daman, relative to admitting to
the mails circulars and periodi
cals carrying such advertise
ments, were very much in line
with the sentiment of the people
of Mississippi:
Mr. Vardaman. I am very much
in favor of striking at this nefarious
traflic in any way that would em
barrasH or hinder it. If we can not
hit it in the face, I would shoot it
in the hack; I wou Id sandbag it,
hamstring it. 1 want to do every
thing within my power to discourage,
to condemn, to outlaw and render
odious the liquor traflic, It is re
sponsible for more murders, the
perpetration of more outrages upon
innocent, virtuous women it has
made more widows, orphaned more
children, blighted more lives, frus
trated more ambitions, sent more
men to jail, has done more to fill
the hospitals with the sick and the
asylums with the insane in a word
it has wrought more unhappinoss
and horrible havoc among man
kind than all the other agencies for
evil combined. If I had my way,
Mr. President, I would close the
door of every saloon on earth. I
would restrict the manufacture and
sale of alcoholic stimulents to scien
tific and mechanical purposes. I
can not for the life of me under
stand how, with its record of wrongs,
a civilized Christian nation will per
mit this social cancer the open
saloon to continue to cut into the
very vitals of our civilization. To

Automobile to be Given For
Best Corn Club Work.
( MiasisfliDpi A. & M. College. E. U. Llejd
Director.)
While virtue is its own reward,"
an automobile in addition detracts
nothing from the virtue and mate-
terially increases the value of the
reward.
All superintendents of education
who assist in making good corn clubs
in their counties this year, will have
the gratification of having worked
in a worthy cause, but the one who
makes the best showing in corn club
work as determined by the county
corn club exhibit at the State fair
this fall, will be given an automo
bile to supplement this feeling of
satisfaction of work well done. This
is the announcement of C. A. Cobb,
State director of corn clubs, in, the
recently issued premium list of the
Fair Association. The rules gov
erning the award are as follows:
Each county represented must
have an enrollment of at least fifty
boys.
An exhibit of not less than ten
nor more than twenty, ten ear ex
hibits, representing a corresponding
number of the crops of the boy's
corn club members, must be shown.
JtCach exhibit must be supported by
a record of the crop represented. .
. The total possible score will be
400, half of which will be based on
exhibits and half on the highest
number of reports from a 'single
county. , y':
A second prize of $50 and a thhrd
prize of $25 will bet awarded on the
came basis as the automobile.

Much of the screening that is done
is ineffective.' An idea prevails
among many people that screening
of doors and windows of a residence
gives all necessary protection so far
as this particular measure is con
cerned, against flies and mosquitoes.
The door is screened often with a
crack at the bottom which admits
flies and mosquitoes freely, or in
time it becomes punctured with
holes, through which they gain ac
cess to the home. In a sense, this
kind of screening causes the inmates
of the home to live with a feeling of
false security. In other words, when
ever screening is done in a careless
manner, whether it be a home or a
restaurant or a hotel, it permits flies
and mosquitoes to enter, and when
these diseases carrying insects once
gain admittance, this kind of screen
mg prevents tnem irom escaping
from the house; in other words it
i. ... .
serves as a trap instead of a pro
tection. '
Screening to be effective should be
done with care; no cracks should be
left around the screen door or win
dow, even the smallest opening wiil
be found by a blood seeking mos
quito or a filth carrying, fly. The
wire gauze should have 16 to 18
meshes to the square inch. Even a
14 mesh wire gauze will allow small
mosquitoes to enter unless it is
painted; . the 12-inch wire gauze
should never be used. This serves
to protect against flies but not mos
quitoes.
During the summer months it is
desirable to have a portion or all of
he portal screened, as it is usually
the custom for all people to sit on
he porch in the evening during the
summer months. As malaria is
spread by a certain kind of mosquito
which usually bites only at night, it
is necssary to use special precautions
between dusk and sunrise. Every
home should be protected rc-
out such protection, it is shown that
they spend more money in doctor's
bills in one year because of this,
than screening costs. ''!
Likewise all restaurants, hotels!
and meat markets should be screen
ed carefully in order to protect food
against the disease spreading house
fly. W. T. Leathers,

Justic Hughes will be the first
member of the United States Su
preme Court who has ever made the
presidential race. Where the exper
iment has been tried by jutices of
state courts the results have not been
altogeather pleasing to them. Take
Judge Parker, for instance, taken
from the New York Court of Appeals
in 1904 to head the Democratic
ticket. - One of his predecessors,
Chief Justice Folger, left his high
office in 1881 to become secretary
of the treasury under president Ar
thur. In the year following he was
nominated for governor of New York
by the Republicans. Grover Cleve
land ran against him and performed
the remarkable feat of beating him
by nearly 200,000 plurality an un
precedented figure for those days.
This made Cleveland president in
1884 and sent Judce Folder to his
grave about the same time. Phila

Ccrrcnza's Answer.
The Carranza government puts it
back to the Wilson government in
strong and even bitter language, cal
culated to provoke hostilities on the
instant, and would undoubtedly do
so, if a less patient man than Wilson
had charge of our affairs.
After all of the Carranza bluster.
however, there is down in the last
paragraph but one suggestion of a
basis of future agreement and peace.
The significant line reads:
But short of a well defined agree
ment (the Constitutionalist govern
ment) will not permit a foreign na
tion to enter Mexican territory with
its armed forces.
Carranza's contention is that our
forces are in Mexico by assumption
of permission that has not been
giyen. We infer from the language
used that the issue is as to Mexican
national dignity, and that if we re
spect that we may proceed as now
to the actual putting down of ban
dits and safeguarding our frontier.
This, however, is only an inference.
There may be nothing in it.
If there is any honorable way to
avoid war with Mexico, we certainly
wish to see it employed. We trust
that Mr. Wilson will discover it
Mobile Register,
One View of It.
In our opinion, the only salvation
for Mexico is for Uncle Sam to take
it over and establish a protectorate
like we did in Cuba. We would
suggest that Teddy Roosevelt be ap
pointed provincial president of the
Province of Mexico with full author-
lty to quell the disturbance. The
whole cursed cactus covered greaser
country is not worth the life of one
good old Mississipp Democrat.

The New York Tribune, whose
republicanism has never been ques
tioned, as it has always been ultra
partisan, says: ' Mr. Wilson's ut
terances have been far more specific
and definite than Mr. Hughes' and
have earned him opposition and de
nunciation. Many, many months
ago this newspaper said: 'It would
be better for the Republican party
to endorse Woodrow Wilson in 1916
than to permit the principle to be
estabiished that to defend American
interest is to commit political sui
cide.'"' The tribune meant that
on July 16, 1915, and it means it
June 14, 1916. It believes now as
it believed then that if the German
American interests are identified
with any candidate, that candidate
will be defeated by Americans, with
out regard to party. . Only Mr.
Hughes can decide whether his can
didacy shall have this label and only
he can present it. Greenwood Com
