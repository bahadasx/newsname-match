dreds of men and women and many
children were on the beach this after
noon when a swimmer, far out beyond
the outer life lines, raised a cry for
help. George White and Chris Ander
son, life guai ds, who had been watch
ing the swimmer closely because of his
distance from shore, launched a life
boat and started for him while the
crowd on the beach watched in su
spense and fear.
As the life guards drew near him the
water about the man was suddenly
tinged with red nnd he shrieked loudly.
A woman on shore cried that the man
in the red canoe had upsei, but others
realised it was blood that colored the
water and women tainted at the sight.
As the life guards reached for the
swimmer he cried out that a shark had
bitten him and then fainted.
They dragged him into the boat and
discovered that his left leg had been
bitten off above the knee aud the right
leg just below the knee. The shark
also had knippod his side, for there
were marks ot teeth beneath the arm.
Women Bed when the man was placed
on the beach, but the life guards and
other men tried to bandage his wounds
While a doctor was called. Before one
arrived however the man was dead. He
was recognised as Charles Itruder, a
bell boy in a local hotel, who had the
reputation of being a strong swimmer
who often went out beyond the life
line.:
The news that the man had been
killed by a shartt spread rapidly
through the resort, and many persons
were so overcome by the horror of
Hruder's death that they had to be as

24 DEATHS REPORTED YESTERDAY
Medical Authorities Fear That Epi

mainder of Summer.
New York, July 7. Infantile pa
ralysis made greater headway in the
city yesterday than on any day since
the beginning of the outbreak. One
hundred and thiity-three new cases and
tw enty. four deaths Were reported. The
number of new cases was a record for
any twenty-lour hours since the begin
ning of the outbreak.
Coincident with the announcement of
the accelerated spread of the disease
Health Commissioner haven Emerson
said that William (1. McAdoo, secretary
of the treasury had offered to the city
the services of the United states Public
Health Service, and that the offer had
been accepted.
"We've gone the limit in our efforts
to prevent and control the disease," Dr.
Kmerson said, "and we shall continue
to go the limit, but I have no confidence
that it is under control. My experience
With other epidemics of Infantile paral

weather."
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
State Board of Health Takes Steps
Protect Vermont Children.
to
I'.urllngton. July 7. At the regular
monthly meeting of the State board of
health, held yesterday afternoon, steps
were taken by the members of the
board towards protecting Vermont chil
dren Cfom po&sible contact with infan
tile paralysis which they might catch
fioin children who are brought to thin
oily from Now York where an epidemic
is raging. The following statement
given out by the board explains itself
nfautile paralysis (epidemic polio
myelitis) is prevailing to an unusual
extent in the city of Greater New-
York.
Families in that city in which then-
are children will naturally take such
children as far as possible into the
country. The State of Vermont has
unusual reasons for taking extraor
dinary precautions against this dis
ease. Infantile paralysis is generally
recognised as a contagious disease and
one that may be spread innocently by
persons who have no clinical symp
toms, in other words, by "abortlv
uses'" or "healthv carriers." The
State board of health ol this Stale
deems it reasonable under the circum
stances to make the following rules
and regulations; therefore, under Hit
authority of the Vermont statutes, tin
following rules and regulations an
promulgated :

CARNIVAL IS COMING
Combination of Shows to Be Here a
Full Week.
Sons of Veterans have at different
times in the past held bazaars, picnics
and other events of a similar character
and the members of this organization
through their varied experiences came
to the conclusion that they wanted to
olfer their friends something entirely
new for this summer so they have ar
raigned with the La Orou's Exposition
shows to play Bennington the week
of July 17th under their auspices.
This organization is one of the oldest
established in the far west and the on-
lv 1 1 ason they have left their territory
t he unusual prosperity of this sec
tion of the country.
They offer all the usual attractions
of an organization of this character,
but their outfit is of a more solid char
acter than any similar show. Included
in their attractions is a massive spec
tacular carousel, a big ferris wheel, a
motordome where several daring men
ride motorcycles at a speed that would
prohibitive on an average race
track, an atheletie show where practi
cal and strenuous demonstrations of
the modes of defence of different na
tions is given and a musical show con
sisting of first class vaudeville.
All shows are given In comfortable
rain proor pavilions and at night wiin
the thousands of electric lights the
scene is very spectacular.
The Sons of Veterans have always
given the people the vest best in the
line of clean amusement and in this
attraction they guarantee they will
fully sustain their ;ast reputation.
REHEARSALS UNDER WAY
For Production of Julius Caesar Next
Month.
Rehearsals are well under way for
the big out-of-door production of
Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar," to be
given in Clark's woods on the evenings
of Thursday and Friday, August '.i and
4, and the afternoon of Saturday, Aug
ust 5. Wednesday's Iloston papers
contain articles and pictures of the
same play given en the steps of the
Boston public library.
It is regretted that Iloston is ahead
of Bennington in this one matter, but no
doubt the Hub felt It had to provide
some entertainment for its people on
the Fourth, since tho North Bennington
arade was too far away for many of
them to take in. .
It is said that Boston had some not
ed actors who took part in their pro
duction, but in that, certainly Ben
nington will not be far behind. Watch
for the cast, which will he printed
shortly, and Bee for yourself.
It was suggested to the cost commit
tee that it would be difficult to find a
man to take the part of Caesar, most
men having a prejudice against being
murdered. There was no trouble, how
ever, when the man offered the part
found that he had to go through with
the ordeal three times.
One can get used to anything. The
only thing that seems to faze Judge
llolden, our noble Caesar, is learning
to drive four horses harnessed to a
chariot. He fears an untimely end In
the first act, When by rights ho should
live until the third. The judge will be
glad to talk with any safe and sane ox-
pert chariot driver who can give him
points on the subject.

London, July 7 The British have

trenches east of Laltoiselle, Gen. llaig
reported to the war office today. The
success of the British is considered one
of the most important since the open
ing of the present offensive. Counter
attacks by the Germans in the La
Boiselle sector are reported to have
been repulsed with heavy losses.
Paris, July 7 The open town of

11 women and children and wounding
three others. Lure is near the German

London. Julv 6. The Anglo-French
offensive against the German lines
north and south of the river Somme
has come to a Standstill. London and
Paris report no siib'antial further

a resumption of the attacks witnln

military critics share this view, voic

Meanwhile the Teutons are leverish
ly engaged in bringing up heavy rein
forcements, allied aviators are doing
their best to disturb the foe In this
activity.
Throughout the day. the Germans
launched violent counter attacks, first
against the British and later, In the
afternoon, against the two extremities
of the new French line. All these on
slaughts wore repulsed, according to
the French and British night reports.
The Teutons did succeed, however, in
recapturing two small woods a little
north of the village of Hem, lost to
the French yesterday.
The French, on the otner hand, took
a small wood on tne northeastern out
skirts of Hem.
British In adquarters reports "further

The Germans admit tills but say the
success was balanced by a counter at

$1251 STATE TAX
FROM ESFSTE OF
HETTYjGREEH
:Will Bequeaths Vast Properties to
Son and Daughter
NEW YORK STATE INTERESTED
If Estate Is Subject to Inheritance Tax
It Will Amount to $4,000,000, the
Largest on Record. j
Bellows Falls, July A tax of $1250
is the extent of the fee which Vermont
may expect from the estate of millions
disposed of in the will of Mrs. Hetty
Green, long known as America's
wealthiest woman, in the opinion of
state and local officials who read
the provisions of her will today. The
document gave practically the entire
estate to her son, Col. K. H. R. Green,
and her daughter, Mrs. Matthew Astor
Wilkes. This fact made the bulk of
the inheritance exempt as there is no
tax In this state on property willed
from parents to children. Mrs. Green's
bequests totalling $25,000 to relatives,
however, are subject to a 5 per cent
tax and from this source the state will
realize $1250.
Although the will expressly stipu
lated that no inventory or appraisal of
the estate should be required it was
said today that the extent to which
Mrs. Green had developed her birth
right might be determined through an
order from the probate judge.
In this connection local officials
pointed out that Mrs. Green had claim
ed tliis village, which is in the town of
Rockingham, as her legal residence
during the last quarter century com-l
ing here annually for a tew weeks' stay.
Each year the tax listers of Rock
ingham placed a valuation of $20,0001
on the homestead and also assessed
a tax on $100,000 of personal property..
Her average tax payment has been!
about $2500 annually, minus a dial
count of 4 per cent for payment wlflH
in !'0 days. Mrs. Green always saved
th 0 allowance.
Albanv, N. Y.. July . Officials or
the state comptroller's office began ar
informal inquiry today to ascertair
whether New ork state is entitled to
an inheritance tax on the estate of MrsJ
Hetty Green. If such a tax is collecta-l
hie it will amount to more than $4,000,J
duo, it was estimated. The largest in-l
heritance tax. heretofore collected by
the comptroller's office was $;i,15O,000
