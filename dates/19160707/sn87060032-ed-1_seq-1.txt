SAMPSON PICKED AS
WINNERSAYS TIMES
Mr. Will S. Kaltenbacher Writing for the
Louisville Times, Tells Why Judge
Sampson's Friends Pick Him to Win.
While there will be no Con
gressional primaries in the Tenth
and Eleventh Districts these dis
tricts as well as a part of the
Ninth, comprising the Seventh
Appellate District will have a
heated Republican Primary for
Judge of the Court of Appeals.
As the matter now stands, the
friends and supporters of Judge
Flemming D. Sampson, of Bar
bourville, figure him to win with
hands down, the Republican
nomination for Appellate Judge
in the Seventh District eompris-
The above article states some
of the reasons and some good
reasons, for Judge Sampson's
wonderful strength in the Sev
enth Appellate District, but
there are other reasons well
known to the many friends of
Judge Sampson why he should
be and will be winner in this

solid. Men who work in the
mines, at the shops, and on
the farms are for Sampson.
Thev can trust him as a friend.
The poor man has always had
the same fair treatment in his
courts while he has been our Cir
cuit Judge, as the rich and pow
erful. It is well known by all
that the poor and needy and un
fortunate, when brought into
litigation in these tribunals pre
sided over by Judge Samp3on,
are accorded a square deal and
have guaranteed to them fair
consideration. When he is pro
moted to that high position of
Judge of the highest Court in the
state he will be the same and
have Jthe same noble ideals of
right and justice to humanity
under the law. Judge Sampson
always standing for the right
and the up-liftof his community,
is one of Knox County's best
citizens. He is a brilliant law
yer and it is claimed, the best
Circuit Judge this district has
ever had, and he will make a
great Judge on the Appellate
Bench.
Dixie Highway.
Editor Mountain Advocate:
Barbourville, Ky.
Dear Sir:
I understand that noth
ing definite has been done yet by
the Knox County Fiscal Court
towards letting the contract for
the Dixie Highway through Jto
Corbin. Would like to inquire
from you the situation as you
see it and prospects of this being
settled soon.
Owing to the fact that Whitley
County, Ky, is building from
Corbin to Jellico and that Camp
bell County, Tenn., is building
Jellico to LaFollette, making a
shorter route from Corbin to
Knoxville, and owing to the fact
that Knox County does not seem
to be getting anywhere vith
their woik on the Dixie High
way, it appears to me that there
is strong danger that the Dixie
Highway Association will be
forced to change the route by
way of Jellico leaving JKnox
County and Cumberland Gap out
entirely.
I believe the directors of the
Association prefer to stick to
their original designation where
possible, but it seems to me the
people of your county should
realize the importance the Dixie
Highway can be to them and
take Jsome action which would
insure the building of the road.
Believe your paper could
doubtless publish some effective
article along this line. Would
like to hear from you as to the
situation.
Thanking you in advance, I am
Very truly yours,
A. F. Sanford.
WHY WORRY?
We are now able to give out a
concrete and authentic state
ment as to what we may expect
at the close of the European War.
It is the promise in the sky, fol
lowing a previous deluge, and is
contained in the book of Genesis,
8:22 as follows:
"While the earth remaineth,
seedtime and harvest, and
cold and heat, and summer
and winter, and day and night
shall notecase."
MEXICO.
It had to be done eventually,
so the sooner, the better refer
ring to the cleaning out of a dis
orderly house next door. It is
foolish to minimize our task.
Th mre guarding of frontier
of l.Stohiles is an undertaking.
In January, 18-1(1, we went into
Mexico, and it took us until June,
1818. to conquer and get out.
There was room for argument
then as to the righteousness of
our cause. Now, the whole
world knows that we are taking
hold of an intolerable situation,
without the intention of securing
a foot of ground or a dollar of
revenue; nor are we simply satis
fying an indignant people
merely a case of the patienl
worm turning.
AREA.
Mexico 767,000 sq. miles.
United States, 300, 000, 000 sq. mi.
Kentucky 40,000 sq. mi.
New York 49,200 sq. mi.
England . . . 51,850 sq. mi.
Germany . 208.830 sq. mi.
France .. . 201,000 sq. mi.
TOI'ULATION.
The census of 1901 are the last
figures to be had, at which time
there was reported a population
of 13.(507,000; 1!)'J of which are
classed as white, i. e. of Spanish
descent; W,l. Indians, repre
senting a score of tribes; the
other 13'- are mixed blood
Japanese, Chinese, and Plain
Dog. The Constitution of 1824
abolished all race distinctions.
CLIMATE.
Tropical, sub-tropical; hot days
and nights on the coasts, hot
days and freezing nights in the
mountains. Rainy season, May
to October; dry season, balance
of the year. The costal plains
are unhealthful, yellow fever,
malaria and dysentary being pre
valent. The high altitudes,
while arid, are healthful under
proper hygienic conditions.
Mountain peaks rise to a height
of 1S.000 feet. Incidentally, the
aspirations of most of the people
do not reach such heights-rather
noint the other direction.
FOREIGN TRADE.
The last authentic figures ob
tainable are of 1907. The im
ports, valued in United States'
gold, amounted to $111,235,000;
exports, $123,515,000, one-half
of the latter being precious
metals. Both imports and ex
ports have dwindled greatly
since 190!) on account of distur
bed conditions.
The best available authority is
the statement of the President
of Mexico, who, in April, 1909,
stated that there were 14,857
miles of railroad in Mexico,
11,851 miles of which being con
trolled by the Government.
DEBT.
There is an exterior debt in
Mexico of about $190,000,000,
with the interest now in default.
There is an interor debt, payable
in silver currency, of about
$75,000,000 (our money) with
some accumulated interest. The
bulk of the exterior debt is held
by England and France. With
a stable government set up, this
would probably shift to us.
Sampson-Rowland
Mr. nnd Mrs. F. F. Rowland of
Hopper, Ky., announce the mar
riage of their daughter Margar
ete, to Mr. D. T. Sampson of
Hay Minnette, Ala., the cere
mony being performed by the
Rev. Cobb of Woolum. at the
home of Mrs. Walter Riley July
4th.
The wedding was a quiet one,
the bride being attended by her
sister Miss Lucy Rowland, the
groom by Mr. Amos Mayhew.
The groom will be remembered
by many as one of the party who
was on the location of the C. & M.
A charming repast was served
by Mrs. Riley, who is a cousin of
the bride.
The party consisted of: Mr.
and Mrs. Riley, Mr", and Mrs.
Samps hi, Misa Lucy Rowland,
Miss Gertrude Steele; Messrs.
Mayhew, Jolly, Hinkle and Mit
Conspiracy Charged
BY FRIENDS OF JUDGE SAMPSON CORPORA
TIONS LOOK UPON HIM AS DANGEROUS
CANDIDATE A SCHEME TO DEFEAT
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.
Very carefully laid plans, so it is charged are underway, and
have been discovered by friends of Judge F. D. Sampson, whereby
certain of his opponents in the race for the Appellate Judgeship
are entering into an arrangement with Railroad Companies
and Dig money interests of the district, through their agents and
attorneys, to bring about the defeat of Judge Sampson. His
friends openly charge that such an arrangement is already under
negotiation, that meetings have been held, and other meetings
are being planned. It amounts to no less, so it is claimed, than a
wicked conspiracy in a last desperate attempt to defeat Judge
Sampson at all hazard in the August Primary Election. The plan
is for the corporations to take one or more of the candidates off.
Cut and dried conventions are to be held, if the scheme is carried
out in which it will be arranged for some of the candidates now
runnir g to get out of the way, and a concentrated effort made
against Sampson with some one upon whom the cm' ined reposi
tion can unite.
Judge Sampson is the recognized friend of the common people;
the Railroads, Corporations, and big money interests, are un
friendly to his candidacy. They are fighting him and it is only
fair to the good people of the district that thev be apprised of
what is going on, and warned of the attempted infringement upon
their rights. Judge Sampson, although the friend of the people
that he is, is being denounced at these meetings as a dangerous
candidate for these interests referred to. The voters are, there
fore, warned by the Judge's friends to lookout for this and all
sorts of political trickery. But. let these infiuencies do their
worst, the people are not going to be driven to vote against Judge
Sampson. Such a vile conspiracy, if it becomes known to the peo
ple to exist, will only be resented by the voters, and will have an
effect of increasing Judge Sampson's vote most wonderfully all
over the district. The people cannot be fooled in such a manner,
nor by such tactics.

An Old Citizen Who
Knows Sampson Well
To The Editoh of Advocate:
I have known Flem D. Samp
son for more than thirty years,
and have known his father and
transacted business with him
years ago even before he moved
from Laurel to Knox County.
I want to say to you and the
voters of this district that Flem
D. Sampson is alright, and ho
comes from good stock. The
Sampsons are all good Republi
cans too. I am for Judge Samp
son because we have tried him,
and I know he is a friend to the
poor class of people. He does
justice to all men exactly alike
in his court.
All the boys in this part who
stays with the log cabin are the
same way all for Sampson.
