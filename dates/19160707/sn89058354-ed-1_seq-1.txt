Grove Dormitory Movement
Is Meeting Encouragement:
More Than $7,000 Raised
More than $7,000 of the $17,000
needed for the erection of the
proposed boys dormitory at
Grove school has already been
subscribed and the committee is
meeting with much encourage
ment. Considerable enthusiasm
is being shown by the citizens,
not only of Paris, but of the
whole county.
One month of vacation has al-
4 ready passed. Grove will open
for another term in September
and the boosters for the dormi
tory are anxious to get the work
started on the building.

P0RTERSAYSS1MS
HAS OUTLIVED DAY
OFHiSUSEFULNESS
Dudley Porter, candidate for
Congress, spoke at the Sulphur
Well Tuesday. He discussed
Good Roads, Preparedness and
other national questions, He al
so referred to the Senatorial
race of Congressman Sims, and
had the following to say regard
ing some of the campaign argu
ments now being made by Mr.
Sims: "Judge Sims, and his
subsidized newspapers are ad
vancing the argument that it
would be unwise, in view of the
Europern aud Mexican situations,
to retire from Congress an ex
perienced man like Mr. Sims at
this time. It will be recalled,
that in the campaign of 1910,
that the Congressman and these
same newspapers were singing
practically the same tune and
making practically the same ar
gument.. They then said that
the Democrats of the Eighth
District would commit a grievous
error if they failed to re-elect I
Mr. Sims, because the tariff
would probaaly be revised by the
(2nd Congress, and that under
such conditions a man of experi
ence would be needed in Con
gress. In view of the fact, that Judge
Sims is- net Chairman of the
committee on Foreign Affairs, or
any other committee that deals
with the grave problems present
ed by the European and Mexican
Wars, and is not regarded as a
Congressional leader in Wash
ington, it does not seem to me
that the logic of the Congress
man and his lieutenants can
hardly be considered sound. The
republic does not rest upon the
shoulders of Judge Sims, and he
is not a national necessity.
Other young Tennesseans, who
were elected to Congress years
later than Mr. Sims, have become
couspicuous members of the
House of Representatives and
are invited to the White House
to confer with the President
about the Foreign situation.
Why does not President Wilson
also seek the advice and councel
of the veteran Representative,
from the Eighth Tennessee Dis
trict? Mr. Sims, in his speeches
es and letters, dwells at length
upon the many advantages of
long Congressional service. Near
ly 20 years of Congressional ser

Held at McKenzie Friday

I,
By unanimous vote the Demo
cratic convention held at the
court house Monday afternoon
to select delegates to the McKen
zie convention of July 14 in
structed this county's delegates
to vote as a unit for the nomina
tion of T. H. Whitlock for Flo
terial Representative.
Dr. A. H. Miller, member of
the Floterial committee, called
the convention to order. On mo
tion of W. D. Cooper, S. P.
Fitzhugh was elected chairman,
and upon motion of Dr. Miller,
Natnan D. White was chosen
secretary.
Frank E. Bryant then intro
duced a resolution naming the
delegates and instructing them
to vote for Mr. Whitlock for
Floater. The resolution further
provided "that the delegates
herein named be instructed to
introduce and support a resolu
tion in the floterial convention
instructing the nominee of that
convention to vote in the Legis
lature for the Hon. J; B. Thoma
son for Comptroller, Hon. Porter
Dunlap for Treasurer and Hon.
W. D. Scruggs for Secretary of
State."
W. D. Cooper moved to amend
by striking out that part of the
resolution in regard to Messss.
Thomason, Dunlap and Scruggs.
He said that Messrs. Thomason
and Dunlap had been endorsed
by the Democrats of the county
in a previous convention and that
as there were two or more can
didates for Secretary of State
and might be others that he did
not think the convention should
instruct for any candidate for
thai position.
Mr. Bryant stated that he
thought the convention should
instruct for Messrs.. Thomason.
Dunlap and Scruggs, as the for
mer endorsement of Messrs.
Thomason and Dunlap was not
binding on the nominee. He
moved to table the amendment.
Upon aye and no vote the amend
ment was declared tabled.
Mr. Cooper moved to reconsider
in order that he might move to

Justices Postpone Matter of
Time Warrants Until Next
Year In Order To Substi
tute BondsJury Venire Is
Named at Session of Quart
erly Court Chautauqua
Must Pay License
Monday the county court, in
quarterly session, defeated a
proposition made by Justice W.
M. Huddleston that the court
proceed with the election cf the
three commissioners to have
charge of the funds to be derived
from the road bond issue, in case
the bond issue is ratified in
August.
Justice Huddleston urged that
the commissioners be selected in
advance and ratified by the next
term of the court in order that
the people mieht know before
voting for the bond issue who
would have charge of the expen
diture of the funds.
Opponents of Justice Huddles-
ton's proposition thought that
the court had no authority and
could not name the commissioners
until the bond issue was carried.
The matter of the $65,000 time
warrants, authorized to pay off
the county's indebtedness, was
taken up and, in accordance with
the suggestion made in Judge
Clendenin's message, was post
poned until next year in order
that the Legislature might enact
an enabling measure, allowing
the county to issue negotiable
bonds instead of time warrants.
The special tax levy of 25 cents
on the $100 was made for the
purpose of paying interest on the
$65,000 indebtedness and any re
mainder to be applied on this in
debtedness. Justice W. T. Snow tendered
his resignation as County Home
Commissioner. It was accepted
and W. D. McSwain was un
ammousiy elected as his suc
cessor.
C. E. Hastings appeared before
the court to request that the
Chautauqua be. released from the
county's part of the privilege
icense. His application was
disallowed by the court.

accompanied by Rev. B. B. Lav-'
ender, Dr. George McSwain and
Curtis Moody. Ira Haynes, color
ed, will do the cooking for the
party.
They have answered the "call
of the wild," as the tired busi

the others would like to do, have
cut themselves off from the out
side world and for nearly two
weeks will enjoy real camp life
on the banks of White Oak creek.
The party of scouts is made up
of the following boys: Charles
