Mystery Cleared
Up This Week
"King of the Range" Discovered
to be Horse Lost Eleven
Years-Found Through
Chronicle Columns.
An eleven-year-old mystery
"was cleared up this week. There
is nothing improbable about it if
dealed with purely from a fic
tional standpoint. But is is the
truth, and therefore seems im
probable, for truth is stranger
than fiction. It has to do with a
horse, and no ordinary horse at
thai., Vingie E. Roe please take
note.
When the last big western North
Dakota range disappeared in 1905,
because of the rapid influx of set
tlers from the east and the recla
mation of thousands of acres from
the range to purposes of agricul
ture, one of the last big outfits to
recognize the new order was that
of Wibaux. Horses and cattle
were gathered from a thousand
hills and shortly after shipped to
eastern markets. The big bunch
of horses were shipped to St.
Louis, then the horse market of
America.
S. D. Whitmer was one of the
early pioneers responsible for the
big change. When he first came
to the Golden Valley he slaked
out the claim on which he has
since resided His equipment
proved barely sufficient for his
modest farming operations. He
had but two horses, later aug
ment by the arrival of two long
legged sprawling, awkward colts.
Th6 mothers objected to being
separated from their offspring
"while Sam cut hay. Likewise the
colts. Peace, so essential to mak
ing hay while the sun shone, was
cnlv secured when Sam tied the
colts to the mothers' ham'es, a
step necessary to prevent the am
putation of their nether limbs by
Ihe rank'ly moving sickle. One
beautiful morn llie instinct of free
and untrammeled liberty proved
too strong for colt number one
and,he seceded from tile union, gal
loping over the hilts and far
away. He never came back. It
was supposed that he became
mixed up with the Wibaux hors
es on Elk Creek at the time of
the roundup, was branded as a
maverick and passed into other
hands.
During the years that followed
stories were told- of a strange
horise, the head of a large band,
which refused to be taken by the
blandishments of men into sur
rendering his person for domes
tic purposes. Somewhere in his
brain there lurked a memory, and
suspicion which refused to be
quieted. Attempts to capture
him proved in vain, and each
time he gathered his herd about
him and garnered them in the
sale seclusion of the hills. And
so the yeprs passed. Finally a
day came when the last' of his
herd was taken from him. Re
fusing to desert them, he suffered
himself to be coralled, and it was
discovered he was branded with
a strange device which no one
seemed to recognize. An accurate
description of him was placed in
the columns of the Chronicle
and convinced that the animal
was his, Mr. Whitmer journeyed
north for a first hand inspection.
It was then the former king of
the range was found to be none
other than the lost colt of eleven
years before, reared in gentility
#5
and relapsed to barbarism. Mr.
Whitmer cast a rope about his
neck, but the "king" was a regu
lar fighting devil and exhausted
Sam and all but foundered his
saddle horse getting him home.
Sam is not yet at all convinced
that he has not a white elephant
on his hands.
MRS. R. THOMPSON ..
SUDDENLY CALLED
Aged Lady Succumbs to Heart
Stroke Friday Morning
Last.—Funeral Held
Monday.
Mrs. R. Thompson, mother of
llie Thompson boys and long a
resident of thfc cily, suddenly
passed away at the, south side
home Friday morning. Death
was due to heart failure. Mrs.
Thompson was aroused from her
sleep by her condition, and doc
tors were summoned. Her con
dition, instead of growing belter,
rapidly grew worse and she pas
sed away at 7:00 o'clock. Prior
to her death, Mrs. Thompson was
seemingly hale and hearty. Her
death is not only a shock to the
family, but to the family's many
friends as well.
Mrs. Thompson was born in
Norway in 1846, coming with her
parents to Jackson county, Wis
consin, in 1857. In 1805 she was
married to Rier Thompson. In
1907 the family moved to Beach,
and have since bee(ii respected
residents here. She was a splend
id woman, and an earnest and
consistent Christian. A member
of the Lutheran church of this
cily she was an indefatiguable
workei in its affairs, where she
will he greatly missed. Early in
life she dedicated her works to
the Christ, sind her power of ex
ample was at all times an influ
ence for good wherever she was
known.
She is survived by her hus
band and the following children:
Henry B. Thompson, A. B.
Thompson and R. B. Thompson
of this city C. L. Thompson of
Grafton N. R. Thompson and
Mrs. .T. O. Knutson of Blair Wis.:
and Mrs. Anderson, of Golva, all
of whom were present at the last
sad rites Monday afternoon. In
commemoration of the high res
pects in which the deceased was
held all the business houses
of the city were closed during
the funeral services, which were
held at the Norwegian Lutheran
church, the remains being later
interred in the Beach cemetery.
The bereaved have the sym
pathy of the entire community
in their loss.
Glendive, Mont., July 0—Glen
dive's first frontier roundup is in
full swing. The opening day
started with a picturesque parade
foil owed by a patriotic address by
George J. Jones of Wibaux. A
capacity crowd witnessed the big
wild west show at the fair grounds
in charge of "Badland" Bill Mc
Carthy of Medora, N. D. Riders
and ropers, both cowboys and
cowgirls, put up a splendid exhi
bition. The wild horse race, re
lay race and bucking broncho rid
ing were especially good. A
movie operator was seriously in
jured as he came in contact with
a Mexican steer which objected to
his presence in the arena. The
crowd is the largest Glendive has
known. The festiviities lasted over
Thursday, when Governor S. V.
Stewart of Montana was the guest
of honor.
Barn Nearly
Consumed by Fire
Real Though Unexpected Fire
Exhibition. Culminated the
Fourth of July Celebra
tion in Beach.
With the band playing, a tug of
war in progress on Main street
and the concluding events of the
evening Wild West well under
way at the ball park, the sudden
peal of the fire bell, followed an
instant later by the weird rising
and falling cadences of the fire
sii en suddenly paralyzed the mer
riment of the Fourth of July
crowds and directed their atten
tion to one of the cleverest exhi
bitions of fire fighting ever wit
nessed in this part of the state.
The cause of the blaze is un
known. It is suspected, however,
that it was caused by a number
of convivials celebrating the na
tion's birth in the barn loft, the
ceiebrants being moved through
motives of privacy to withdraw
themselves from the madding
crowds to a haven where the
health of Washington and the
success of the Continental arms
could be drink in due solemnity,
without fear of intrusion. The
theory finds corroboration from
the fact that shortly after the
fiames 'started pouring from the
building, a number variously es
timated at from ten to fifteen
jumped to the ground from the
upper loft and made a spirited re
treat from the scene. That none of
I hem were overcome, or suffered
broken bones, is considered re
markable.
So sudden was the outbreak,
and so rapidly did the flam.es
spread throughout the structure
that the building was considered
doomed. The fire laddies were
scattered all over the city, but in
response to the alarm were soon
gathered at the fire hall, and in
record lime three lines of hose
were playing on the structure.
The heat and dense billows of
smoke put them at a big disad
vantage, but instead of discourag
ing them, stimulated their efforts.
With the entire rear a shell from
which the roof had fallen in, and
with the front almost charred
through before the water was
thrown on, fifteen minutes of
hard work in the face of desper
ate odds sufficed to put the blaze
under control.
The barn is the properly of J.
P. Reeve, who is building a
double store on the .adjoining
south lot. It was stored with con
struction materials, lime and ce
ment, and Contractor Chadder
den, who has the contract for the
construction work of the new
building, lost a fine, complete set
of carpenters tools. Little in
surance was carried on the struc
ture. The loss is estiniated at
S2.000.
A damage which cannot be
reckoned in money occurred to
the fine growth of trees on the
north side of the alley, which
were so badly scorched by the
heal and fames that it is not
thought they will survive. This
was among the finest growth in
the city, and their loss is deeply
regretted, not alone by the owner
but by the entire city as well
The Ladies' Aid of the Luth
eran church, which was to have
been held this week, has been
postponed until next Wednes
day, July 12.

Beach Wins
From Golva
Fourth of July Game Goes to
Beach by Score 8 to 2.
The Beach ball team won its
first game, from Golva on(_Inde
prudence day. The outfleld was
fenced off in a terrible fashion
and nearly caused the refusal of
the Golva hoys to play at all, but
they Anally consented to play the
game. The playing Held was not
much larger than the intleld
sliould have been, hut the baseball
management did not have any
thing to say about the fence
huiiding and want to assure the
Golva boys that the members of
the Beach ball team hated to
p!ay ball in the little place. There
v.as nothing else to do. Hereafter
the baseball hoys hope to have a
voice in matters so that this shall
not happen again.
Campbell was on the mound
for Golva while Phillips did the
twirling for the home bays. Beach
won the game in the first inning,
scoring 4 runs on hits and errors.
Campbell of Ihe visitors was hit
freely, while Phillips had a world
of speed and kept the hits well
scattered. Beach played a fast
game and batted well, Smith,
Palmer, Montague and Pippin
leading with the slick, while Os
good did the best balling for the
visitors. The game was called
about 11 A. M., and a large crowd
witnessed it. Beach will cross
hats with the fast Ollie team on
the laome grounds next Sunday,
f.oing to Ollie the following Sun
day. The Ollie team is one of the
fastest in this part of the country,
and as the teams each have won
or^ game, and each game was won
ty one run, Sunday's game should
be a thriller.
J. R. Waters today sold the
three-year-old trotting stallion,
Jolly Mac to (. W. Hooker, a

at
A crowd variously estimated at
between four and five thousand
people celebrated the Fourth in
Beach. Laden buggies and auto
mobiles arrived from all parts of
the county from early dawn
throughout the forenoon. Many
unable to get an early start aug
mented the crowd in the after
noon.
The usual salute fired at sun
rise aroused many Beach people
from their slumbers. Small boys,
awake at the earliest break of day
set up a din with whistle, horn
and fire cracker, and tried the
early morning patience of the
more staid of our citizens. The
day
was ideal, in spite of a high
thermometer, the slight rain of
the evening previous, aided by the
efforts of the Beach Fire depart
ment with hose, effectually set
tling the dust. No disagreeable
winds, the usual hot day ac
companiment, marred the occa
sion.
At nine o'clock the band boys,
in handsome uniforms, assembled
at the band stand square, where
under the direction of D. M.
Cooper they played several num
bers. At 10:30 the parade, with
J. R. Waters as marshall of the
day: assembled at the Callcnder
hole). Mr. Waters drove his trot
ter, Svanara- 2 :li) :15 hitched to
alight runabout, a large American
flag being draped across the
I horses back, under the back pad.
The way the game little trotter
two-stepped to the music of the
L:.nd occasioned much comment.
A large number of automobiles
the first being occupied by veter
ans of the Civil war, were in the
parade, a number of them be
ing handsomely decorated. A
diminutive Shetland, attached to
small phaeton, was dvi'en by
two children ol J. Still..

put at a big disadvantage for their

the events being for entertainment
only, but the boys did good work,
George himself proving to be the

good. Villa was introduced to
the crowd and was given much

gave the big crowd an effective
demonstration of the efficiency

Prizes were awarded as fol

For the farmer with the largest

The Equal Suffrage League will

I'. J. Hill, president of the
Racky Butte Farmers Co-opera
tive Elevator Co., and a moving
spirit in Golden Valley County co
operative movements, left Wed
nesday afternoon for Bingham,
Maine, where he will spend four
weeks at his boyhood home. Mr.
Hill's visit is remarkable from
the fact that this is his first visit
lo the old home in 22 years, and
the second since he left there 43
years ago. While the rapid flight
of years has produced many
changes in the old place, and old
friends have passed away, or like
Mr. Hill have joined the tide of
emigration westward, there are
sli'l a few friends of his boyhood
who have lived and labored and
grown old within the environs of
Bingham. With these Mr Hill
anticipates many pleasant rem
iniseenses as memory gives new
color to the faded vears.
