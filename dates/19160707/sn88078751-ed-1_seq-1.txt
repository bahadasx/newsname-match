Fighting at Verdun and On the
Eastern Front.
London, July 6. Tho French are
less than tiiree mllos from the fort
ress of Pcionne, the great stronghold
and strategic railway point half way
between Cambrai and Noyon.
This is the chief result of the re
sumption of the great drive against
tho Germans on the wost front. Gen
eral Foch's army captured the Sor
mont farm, south of the Somme,
across the river from the village of
Clery, and then pushed onward on a
front of nearly six miles south of
tho farm. Thus the French achieved
two Important objects: They straight
ened out their front south of the Som
mo and advanced closer to Peronne.
North of the river the French were
equally successful, driving eastward
from Curin toward the Combles-Pe-ronne
road, which serves the Ger
mans as a supply line.
The Germans on their part launch
ed a counter attack against the new
French positions at Bel'oy-en-San-tcrre.
They recaptured part of the
town, but were later rejected. A vio
lent battle rages In the village of Es
troes, where the Germans are holding
out with desperate resistance.
Ab for the day's activity by tho
British, the official renort falls to pirn
any specific facts, stating merely "we,
MrlA ..1 -A 1 , . '1
muuu junufi progress at certain rra
portant points." The statement re
fers to the intense activity of the Ger
man heavy artillery "In certain sec
tors," and renorts the repulse of two
strong German attacks around Thiep
val. No further captures of prisoners are
reported by British headquarters,
While the French war office nlnrp.n the
1 1 ... ,
iiuiuuej ul uiiuumiueu prisoners so
far as "far over 9.000."
In Verdun Sector.
Comparative 'quiet for the time be
ing has setttod over Verdun, although
the bombardments, of necessity, con
tinue. But while the vesplte is on at
Verdun th( Germans have opened a
new attack on the French lines near
the Lorraine frontier, some miles to
the east of Luncville. They delivered
! strong assaults against the French
trenches in this sector and entered
them at three roints, only to be driv
en out fchortly afterwards. Soldiers
havo been shipped from Verdun by
the French to resist the new allied
attack.
The German war office announces
the capture by General Von Linsin
gen's army of 1.140 Prisoners, Includ
ing 11 officers, north, west and south
west of tho VoMrynian fortress of
Lutsk, w'oerp, it is added, the Rus
sians suffered "heavy and bloody
losses-." Field Marshal Von Hinden
burg's headquarters renorts the con
tinuance of Russian concentration of
troops "in the vicinity of Minsk."
The views expressed in Berlin re
specting the Anglo-French offensive
reflect confidence on the part of the
Germans that the German line will
hold and that German control of the
territory now occupied in France and
Belgium will remain steadfast.- .The
fcuccesses, so far attained by the
French and British are looked upon
as of minor importance.
In view of the continuous progress
reported by the French war office
from day to day, with specific enu
meration of newly ?alnod territory,
the British ofilclal statement is arous'
ing no Httlo anx'etv in some quarters.
Some military critics hore voice the
fear that if the French advance south
of tho."Somme keeps up without a cor
responding British progress in the
north, the French will be exposed to
a serious menace in form of a possi
ble flanking attack by the Germans
and the drive toward the fortress of
Peronne, so valuable if supported by
an equal advance northward, will
jayail the French nothing.
