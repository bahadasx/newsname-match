TEXT OF
NOTE Gl\
Carranza Says Immediate Release
of Carrizal Prisoners
was Proof of Sincerity of Desire
to Reach Satisfactory Arrangement
of Difficulties.
Washington, July 5.?Carranza's
reply to the last two American notes
was handed to the state department
todav bv an attache of the Mexican
embassy. The text follow:
"Referring to the notes of June 20
and 25 last, I have the honor to report
to your excellency that the immediate
release of the Carri/.al prisoners was
further proof of the sincerity of the
desires of this government to eich a
pacific and satisfactory arrangement
of the present conflict and it would
be unjust if its attitude is misinterpreted.
It was also the Mexican government
that earnestly suggests a
plan for canton-ments along the boundary
during conferences of Cuidad
Juarez and El Paso. This government
is disposed now, as it has been, to
seek an immediate solution of the two
points which constitute the true
causes of conflict between two countries,
to wit: The American government
believes reasonably that in the
ecurity of its frontier is the source
of the difficulty and the Mexican govnn
its nurt believes that the
stay of American troops on Mexican
territory aside from being a trespass
on the sovereignty of Mexico is the
immediate cause of conflicts. Therefore
the withdrawal of American
troops on one hand and the protection
of the frontier on the other are the
vtwo essential problem!?, the solution
of which must be the directing object
of the efforts of both governments.
The Mexican government isr willing
to consiS^.in a- and practical
v way and prompted by aspirit of concord
remedies which*'shin Id be aj>*.
*! plied to the present'situation. Several
Latiri-Aipericap *(>untries have offered
their. frieiKily mediation to the Mexican
government- and the latter Has
' accepted, it ill principle. Therefore
'the'wfefca'rt gevdrhment oqjy'.awaiw*
in*isi MMimUpili iiiunii ua i>ira
XTnfled Stales would be disposed to
accept this mediation for the purpose
mentioned above or whether it, still
is of the belief that the same results
.may be attained by means of direct
negotiations between both governments.
"in tne meantime una government,
proposes to employ all efforts that
may be at its disposal to avoid a
recurrence of new incidents which
may complicate and aggravate the situation.
At the same time it hopes
the American government on its part
nay make use of all efforts to prevent
any new a?-?s of its military and civil
ithority of frontier that might cause
w complications."

ANZA'S
I/EN TO PUBLIC
enc day in border towns might give
rise to some incident capable of growing
into a clash with Mexicans but
reports from all quarters last night
indicated comparative quiet.
Some excitement was caused here
during the Fourth of July parade
when Jesus Alamanzo, a Mexican,
was overpowered by the crowd. Alamanzo
is alleged to have made an
insulting jesture when that section
of the parade headed by the acting
mayor passed. Some one cried that
a Mexican had insulted the flag and
only the arrival of police saved Alamanzo
from injury. He was taken
to police headquarters and later released.
The big movement of guardsmen
toward the border continued unabated
today. One of Maine's regiments
of infantry passed through here to
its station in the Laredo district and
more Missouri troops reached Laredo.
The heavy New York movement
to the Brownsville district was continued,
the First squadron of cavalry
and the Second battalion of artillery
from that state going through here
today. When all the troops are sta
tioned, New York will have a representation
on the border of about 22,???.

COMPANY OF ENGIN
To Serve in National Guards of S<
Branch of Service?Recruitin
The organization of the Company
of Engineers for service in the Na- b
tional Guards of South Carolina by g
Mr. J. M. "ohnson, C. E., of Marion,
S. C., is welif under way. ^
Mr. J. M. Johnson has been authorized
to recruit a company of engi- e
neers for the N. G. of S. C., and has e
his headquarters at the Jefferson hotel
in Columbia. C(
Mr. Johnson has sent Messrs. J. R.
Pennell and A. G. Kennedy of An- n
derson and Union to their respective jj
home towns to secure recruits for the p
company of which they will be officers.
A number of recruits have already ^
joined this company but more men are
wanted. The engineering corps is the ^
most sought after and desirable 11
branch of the service the officers are
anxious to have maximum number of n
men allowed in the company. The ei
non-commissioned officers and privates is
of engineers receive twenty per cent h
more pay than any other branch of a
the service. g
LETTER FROM STYX.
Camp Moore, Styx, S. C., 7-5-16.
Dear Mr. Rice: ir
The camp is unusuallv quiet this P
morning, owing to two things. One is b
because the boys are all "enjoying" 01
sore arms as a result of the second ^
inoculation which we received yest^tf*
day and the other is because we are
not leaving for the border today. It si
has been rumored considerably that d;
we are going to leave this week some P
time and we sincerely hope so for we *
are all tired of Styx.\ w
We have discovered in oyr company
a hero and a pugilist already. The '
hero MjJip E. Hill of Lockhart, who w
saved Dftn -Ponder of Buffalo from f<
drowning, last Saturday. ' The captain "
is making an effort to secure Hill a ei
stfitafffe reward in the way of a Carnegie
medal/ > E
i The Jfagiiist is Sergeant Walling ?
Price, who^provj^^e^nd all doub^-fl
I haver^^^dWm^^*^ the e<
blues he certainly looks that wAy. Vl
Our company had their examination
Friday and Saturday and itj surely ^
was rigid. There were 32 found phy- P1
sically unfit and five turned down on P
account of illiteracy. C
Several pf the boys have been home
and many more?have hopes of getting
a leave of absence before we start for
the border.
There were about 150 people from 8<
Union here Sunday and quite a few
here yesterday. Needless to say all
of us were glad to see them and were ^
sorry that instead of us being able to A
make a "spread" the majority of us lo'
were the receivers of "big eats" such
as only the home folks are capable of ai
fixing up. ol
I was sorry to hear so many rumors
when I got home of how badly we ^
boys were treated and can only say n<
that I didn't hear one that had any ^
truth in it. Of course we have r<
grouches but the majority of the boys '
are learning that we are serving a ^
common cause and as a natural result
a better feeling of fellowship predominates
throughout both regiments. Vi
We are ahead of many of the other ^
companies in the fact that we are cj
now fully equipped. Some of the
companies have nothing but straw to
sleep on and no covering but we have ^
cots and good heavy, blankets, so we N
have lots to be thankful for.
The boys who did not pass the ex- ,s
animation will be held here until their
discharge comes from Washington. It "
will probably take about ten days for
them to go through the regular chan- P
nel.
A (Un *
nuuui utiii ul tut; cumjjciny was ill
Columbia last niRht for the dance Riv- ^
en in honor of the National Guard of
South Carolina and every one reports o:
a frond time, There was an immense S
crowd there and everybody seemed T
bent on makinR us enjoy ourselves.
I will telepcraph you as soon as we
Ret the order to leave for Texas and
surely hope that I won't have to delay 01
lonR in doinR so. c'
