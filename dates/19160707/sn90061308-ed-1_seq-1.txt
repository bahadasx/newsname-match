MEXICO AND UNITED STATES
PREPARE TO "MAKE UP"
Washington Expects Resumption of
Friendly Negotiations as Result of
Carranza's Conciliatory Note.
Washington, July 6. Early resump
tion of friendly diplomatic conversa-
tions with the de facto government of
Mexico to the end that peace and order
may be restored in northern Mexico
and along the border, is expected here
to be the next step of the United
States in its relations with its southern
neighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M., and culmi
nating in the fight at Carrizal, Mex.,
between American and Mexican
troops, appeared last night to have
been dissipated by an amicable note
from General Carranza, presented by
his ambassador designate here, Eliseo
Arredondo. The note proposes that
the differences between the govern
ments be settled by mediation or by
direct negotiations.; It is remarkable
for its brevity, it restrained and
friendly tone and for the absolute lack
of any of the strong, even insolent,
language which characterized the last
two communications from the de facto
government. It treats as a- closed
incident the exchange of unfriendly
communications which brought war
almost within sight.
Charles Reign Scoville, the well
known evangelist, is expected here
this evening. He is arranging to go
fishing with Jared Woodfill and other
friends. Aurora World.

SHADE TREES SHOULD NOT
BE BUTCHERED IN PRUNING
The Missouri Agricultural Experiment
Station Gives Instruction in
Right Pruning Methods.
There is a right and a wrong way
to prune shade trees, just as there is a
right and wrong way to pruning fruit
trees. H. F. Major of the Missouri
College of Agriculture has prepared
a circular which illustrates the exact
ways in which the common shade trees
should" be pruned. The reasons for
pruning shade trees are to remove
dead wood, to take out crowding
branches, to increase the buds that
produce flowers, and to balance up the
tree.
Circular 81, "Pruning Shade Trees,"
is available for free distribution to
the citizens of Missouri who want to
prune their shade trees in such a way
as to make them more beautiful and
preserve them without destroying
their effectiveness for a year or two
after the pruning. Anyone can easily
follow the simple directions and illus
trations given and prune their own
trees according to the methods fol
lowed by the leading landscape arch
itects of the country.

GF.RMAN TRENCHES ON 6-MILE
FRONT TAKEN BY FRENCH
British Line Apparently Has Failed to
Advance, but Positions Captured
Are Being Reorganized.
London, July 6. The entire second
position of the Germans south of the
Somme over an extent of approximate
ly six miles has fallen into the hands
of the French, who have also captured
the village of Hem, near the northern
extremity of their line and have com
pleted their conquest of Estrees. The
British line apparently has failed to.
advance "except slightly in certain
sectors," as the British war office puts
it.
None of the ground gained by the
British has been lost, however, and.
the further statement of the British
that the fighting all along the battle
front was mostly in the nature of local
struggles for the possession of strong
-points would seem to indicate that
each side is devoting particular atten
tion to the organization of its position!
and the strengthening-of its hands for
further attack or defense.
The number of German prisoners
reported by the British and French hasi
reached about 16,000, while the Ger
man casualities have been unofficially
estimated at 60,000. On their part,
the Germans report the taking of a
considerable number of British sol
diers. BARRY COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT
