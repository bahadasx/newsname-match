vances Are Recorded by Either Germans or French in
the Verdun Region.
' Violent counter-attacks by the Ger
; mans on almost the entire line of the
French advance in the Somme region
i show a change in the situation from
the earlier days of the Anglo-French
j offensive. In the beginning the Ger
, mans concentrated their forces against
; the British apparently considering the
operations of the French to the south
! a sof small signirtcence. But the
j rapid movement of the French troops
together with the importance of the
I objective for which they are aiming,
i has had the effect of changing the
. German view and causing the Ger
! man commanders to strengthen their
j defences and forces along the line pro-
tecting Perrone and other important
' strategic points.
Both ends of the French line have
.been under heavy attacks, but the
French, according to the official ac
counts, have been able to put them
down, without the Germans making
any gains whatever. Meanwhile both
French and British are consolidating
their positions and are undoubtedly
making preparations for a repetition
of the great bombardment which pre
ceded the first impetuous rush.
While the situation in the Verdun
region remains comparatively quiet,
there are heavy bombardments on both
sides of the Mouse. Xo advances are
recorded by either French or German.
The British official statement gives
few details, merely remarking that "as
; result of violent bomb fighting we
made further progress at certain points
in the main battle area."
HALF MILLION TEUTONS
PUT OUT OF COMMISSION
Since the . Russians Began Their Ad
vance a Month Ago.
Petrograd, via London, July 6, 10.05
p. m. Nearly half a million Austrians
and Germans have been put out of
commission since General Brussilolt'
began his great advance a month ago
today. TIrj grand total of prisoners
to date is in round numbers 235,000,
of which 4,500 are officers.
Without the actual figures regard
ing the dead and wounded, careful es
timates by military experts, based on
the best information, place the latter
at 200.000 to 220,000. The Austrians
predominate overwhelmingly among
the prisoners, but among the dead and
wounded it is said that a fairly large
percentage are eGrmans. The Ger
man losses in stopping the Russian
advance at Kovel and in counter-attacks
made in solid ranks were en
ormous. The booty captured reach
es incalculable gflures. It is figured
that 250 guns of various sizes and up
wards of 700 machine guns Is a con
servative estimate. In addition vast
quantities of munitions, supplies and
transports have fallen into the hands
of the Russians.

INQUIRY ON INHERITANCE
TAX OF HETTY GREEN ESTATE.
If Collectible in New York It Will
Amount to More Than $4,000,000.
Tlmany, N. Y., July 6. Officials of
the state comptroller's office began an
informal inquiry today to ascertain
whether New York state is entitled to
an Inheritance tax on the estate of
Mrs. Hetty Green. If such a tax is
collectible it will amount to more than
1 4.000,000, it was estimated. The
largest inheritance tax heretofore col
lected by the comptroller's office was
$3,150,000 on the estate of John Jacob
Astor. The next largest was $2,350,000
on the estate of Anthony N. Brady.
The inquiry was begun with a view
to learnnig how long Mrs. Green had
resided with her son in New York city,
tit whoso home she died. The officials
pointed out that under a law passed
this year a person la deemed to be a
resident of this state, as as such amen
able to its tax law, if he lived or lodged
in the state, for tttie major cart of the

STRENGTHEN DEFENSES
The immensity of the Russian drive
against the Austrians and Germans
during the last month is indicated by
unofficial reports from Petrograd,
which say that the Austro-German
losses in the endeavor to stay the ad
vance of General Brussiloff's armies,
total nearly half a million men, about
half of whom are prisoners. Not less
than 250 guns of various sizes and
70 machine guns and an immense
quantity of other booty have been
taken.
The Austrians admit a serious defeat
west of Kolomea, where they were
driven back nearly five miles.
The latest official statement from the
Russian war office announces the cap
ure of approximately iO.OOO addition
al prisoners, 5,000 of whom are said
to be Germans, taken in a recent bat
tle on the Dniester. About 5,000 other
prisoners were captured on other sec
tions of the Russian front.
The Germans admit the withdrawal
of General Bothmer's army in the Tar
nopol sector before the powerful at
tacks of the Russians. They concede
also an advance by the British south
of Thiepval, in the western zone.
David Lloyd George, whose untiring
efforts have been responsible for the
immense quantities of shells the allies
are now hurling at their opponents,
has taken over the duties of secre
tary of war in the British cabinet.
Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary,
ha been made an earl, while Lord Der
by, director of recruiting, who helped
to create the British armies, is the

81 ADDITIONAL CASES OF
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
In New York Yesterday Federal
Health Officers Take Matter Up.
New York, July 6. After a confer
ence between William G. McAdoo, sec
retary of the treasury of the United
States, Mayor Mitchell, Health Com
missioner Emerson and others, it was
announced tonight that the United
States Public Health service would
cooperate with the New York authori
ties in their efforts to stamp out the
epidemic of infantile pnralvhsis which
already has cost the lives of more
than 150 children in Greater New
York.
The federal aid, it was said, would
at once be . directed to tracing the
origin of the disease. This will con
sist largely in field epidemiological and
laboratory studies, the latter being
chiefly experiments with animal in
oculations. In this connection it was
said a telegram had been sen to Washing-ton
asking that 100 monkevs pro
cured in the Philippines for the Rock
efeller Institute of Medical Research
here, be not subject to a recent em
bargo order which has delayed their
arrival into the country. According to
Commissioner Emerson, monkeys are
regarded as the best possible animal
mediums thus far discovered for prov
ing the transmission of the disease.
Commissioner Emerson asserted that
the health department is anxious to
find, if possible, the so-called carriers
of the disease, since this seems to be
the information necessary to enable
the authorities to control it.
Additional cases reported since 10
o'clock this morning were eighty-one.
Of these, fifty are in Brooklyn.

ADMINISTRATION REVENUE
BILL DEBATE IN HOUSE.
Kitchen Makes Plea for It as a Non
Partisan Preparedness Measure.
Washington. July 6. The house to
day begun a four days' debate on the
administration revenue bill, designed
to raise $197,000,000 next year by a sur
tax on incomes and by taxes on in
heritances and on war munitions
profits. Under a special rule a final
vote will be taken before adjournment
Monday.
Majority Leader .KItchin opened the
debate with a plea that the bill be
passed as a non-partisan preparedness
measure, since so large a part of the
revenue tio be derived from it would
go to pay for army and navy in
creases. Republican leaders replied by
charging the administration with gross
extravagance and by attacking as ill
advised the means now proposed to
meet the treasury situation.
(Mr. Kitchin outlined in detail the
federal government's financial condi
tion and the expenses that will have
to be met during the coming year. A
total of $280,000,000, he said, would be
needed to carry out the enormous ap
propriation programme congress had
drawn up and the $197,000,000 to be
raised by the revenue bill would leave
but $69,000,000 to be made up out of
the general fund.
"Wre propose," he continued, "to
take from the general balance fund,
which on June 30 was the largest by
many millions of any year for the last
eight years, the sum of $69,000,000 and
then leave in the disbursing offices, or
to their credit, $60,000,000 to operate
the government's current expenses.
After taking out that $39,000,000 to
make good the $266,000,000 we will
then have over $100,000,000 in the gen
eral balance fund.
"We propose to finance any possible
trouble with Mexico, or any other na
tion, as this nation and all other na
tions have always financed such emer
gencies, by the issuance of bonds."
He added, however, that congress
probably would not be called upon to
authorize the bond issue until just be
fore adjournment of the session.
Representative Hill of Connecticut,
republican, declared the bill "pro;bably
puts a heavier burden of taxation upon
the American people than any other
one measure in the history of the re
public." Representative Longworth of Ohio,
republican, announced that he would
support it, "in view of its temporary
character, necessity and high impor
tance of the appropriations it is de
signed to pay and the fact that it in
large measure is based on republican
principles."
VERMONT GETS SMALL
HETTY GREEN TAX,
No Inheritance Tax on Property Willed
from Parents to Children.
Bellows Falls, Yt., July 6. A tax of
$1,250 is the extent of the fee which
Vermont may expect from the estate
of millions disposed of in the will of
Mrs. Hetty Green, long known as
America's wealthiest woman, in the
opinion of state and local .officials who
read the provisions of her will today.
The document, which was filed for pro
bate here after her burial yesterday,
because the mistress of finance main
tained that the old family home in this
villa'ge constituted her legal domicile,
gave practically the entire estate to
her son. Col. E. H. R. Green, and her
daughter, Mrs. Matthew Astor Wilks.
This fact made the bulk of the in
heritance exempt, as there is no tax in
this state on property willed from
parents to children. Mrs. Green's be
quests totalling $25,000 to friends and
other relatives, however, are subject to
a 5 per cent, tax and from this source
the state will realize $1,250.
Although the will expressly stipu
lated that no inventory or appraisal of
the estate should be required, it was
said today that the extent to which
Mrs. Green had developed her birth
right might be determined through an
order from the probate judge.
TALK OF SUCCESSOR TO
HUGHES ON THE BENCH
Attorney General Gregory Thinks Lit
tle Likelihood of His Own Nomina
tion. Washington, July 6.After leaving
the White House after a conference
with the president today. Attorney
General Gregory said he thought there
was little likelihood that he would be
nominated to succeed Charles E.
Hughes on the supreme court.
"There are a number of cases now
pending for re-argument before the
supreme court that I would be dis
qualified from hearing on account of
my connection with them," he said,
"and Justice McReynolds also would
be disqualified in sitting in several
cases. Hence that one of several
good reasons why I think my appoint
ment would be a bad one."
Mr. Gregory declined to make any
comment on the report that Senator
Walsh might be appointed.

Guilt.
New York, July Carlos E. Moore,
who described himself as president of

and S. K Paul, formerly a clerk in

pany, admitted late today, according
to District Attorney Swann, that they

Seymour in the furtherance of their
plans. As the result of the disclosures
made to him today Mr. Swann stated,
he will drop the charges pending
against Detective William J. Burns
and Martin Egan, who is connected
with the Morgans. The charges were
based upon the tapping of the Sey
mours' telephone wire and a search
'ondurted in the offices of the firm
for information that might show who
was responsible for the "leak" in the
Morgan offices.

troops from the Italian front.
