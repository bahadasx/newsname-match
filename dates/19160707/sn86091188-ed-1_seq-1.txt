Whereas, The action of Fred L.
Huston, state auditor, in obtain
ing loans from the state of Idaho
on property in which he had an
actual personal interest and be
longing to himself transgressed
the moral, if not the legal law,
in that he deceived his fellow
land board membersin the trans
action therefore, be it
Resolved, That the evidence of
record in this transaction is con

on the part of the si id Fred I .
Huston, stale auditor, and war

terms: and be it further
Resolved, That this committee,
witli which is joined many lea.l
ing Republicans of Idaho, at lliis
meeting condemns such conduct
on the patt of Fred L. Huston,
state auditor, as we feel, as rep
resentatives of tlie Republican
party, that it is our duly to give
to the people of Idaho notice of
our disapproval and condemnation
of such an act: and, he it further
Resolved, Tnat the said Fred L.
Huston has by his conduct rend
ered himself unfit to hold the re
sponsible position lie now occu
pies, and we regret we have not
the power to enforce nis resigna
tion.
The act for which Huston is so se
The act for which Huston is so se

register of the board delivered Bus
ton an escrow Instruction to an
Idaho Falls hank to bold the war
rants until the title of Hie land had
been cleared, hut that Huston des
troyed toe instructions and presented
the warrants which were cashed, aid
that he changea a fourth warrant loj

well in hand. To tliis end lie will !
visit Boise at an early day. his pres
ent intention being to be in the state !
capital about July 10th when lie lias
business before the federal court. ;
If the Cherry measure as outlined i
shall meet no obstacle in the organic j
law to bar It from operation in this
state it is most certainly destined to
occupy a large place in tlie public
mind when everybody's thoughts are j
turned toward good roads and how to
get them. The automobile owuers
will to the last mother's son of them
see good roads ahead under the Cher
ry plan. They will get what they
want and pay né more than at pre
sent.
The father of the proposed law
thinks that between two hundred
and two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars annually would he the
amount of the revenue derived
from motor licenses. Perhaps the
sdnt would greatly overtop even the
large figure within a year or two in
this state, for popular as they are
now, the use of automobiles would
he greatly increased with systematic
improvement of the roads.
Other features contemplate
,i „
regulation of the width of wagon
tires according to grades of taxation,
making the burdens lightest upuu the
owners of wide tires and heaviest up
on the owners of narrow lires.
