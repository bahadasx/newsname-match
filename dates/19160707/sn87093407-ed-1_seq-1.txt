The Star does not agree with those officials who contend
that the supreme court decision pulls any teeth out of the
prohibition law. The decision. The Star believes, rather
tends to Americanize the law, thereby making it a measure
worthy of greater respect. Such being the case, the law it
STRONGER
A careful reading of the decision shows that it will in no
way interfere with the prosecution of the violators of the
law those who traffic in liquor.
The decision does interfere, and rightfully, with the
right of officers to invade a man's private home, where there
is not even the faintest suspicion that he is a bootlegger.
A man's home is his castle. It should be free from raids for
petty grounds. That is essentially American in spirit -and
in law.
The prohibition law, as it it now on the statutes, and as
it was voted upon, was meant to forbid the sale of liquor
in the state. To get the bootlegger is one thing. To permit
the possibility of any officials or private citizens wreaking
petty vengeance, persecution and spite work against a citizen,
who, without intent to sell liquor, has more than the speci
fied amount stored away, is altogether a different matter.
The prohibition law was not meant to give any one an op
portunity for grandstanding. It was meant to suppress the
saloon and the bootlegger and with that, the supreme court
has not interfered.
