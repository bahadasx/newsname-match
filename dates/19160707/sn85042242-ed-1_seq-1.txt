Violent counter attacks by the Ger­

fror:
the earlier days of the Angl i-French
offeftgive. Tr. ihe beginning, the 'ier
mans concentrated their forces
against the British, apparently con­
sidering the operations of tho French
to ^he south as of small significance.
But the rapid movements of the
French troops, together with the im­
portance of the objective for which
the£ are aiming, has had the eqect of
changing the German view and caus­
ing the German commanders to
strengthen their forces along the line
guarding Tyronne and other strategic
points.
Both ends of the French lines ha/e
been under heavy attack, bur the
trench, according to the official ac­
count, have been able to put them
down without the Germans making
any gains whatever.
Atftet^atfifc^Praparatlortt. -.-•
MeftiWhileV fioth French and Brit­
ish are .consolidating their' positions
and are undoubtedly maxing prepara­
tions- for a repetition of the great
bombardment which preceded the
first rush. While the Verdun region
remains quiet, there are heavy bom­
bardments on both sides of the
iMeuse.
No. advances are recorded by either
French or Germans.
The British official statement gives
few details, merely remarking that
"as a result of the violent bomb fight­
ing, we made further progress at cer­
tain points in the main battle area."
German Losses Heavy.
The intensity of the Russian drive
against the Austrians and Germans
during the last month is indicated in
the unofficial report from Petrograd,
which says that the Austro-Germnn
losses in an endeavor to stay the ad­
vance of General Buissillif's army to­
taled nearly a half million men, about
half.of whom are prisoners. Not l^ss
thaft. 260 guns of various sizes and
more tlian 700 machine guns and an
immense quantity of other booty have
been taken.
The Austrians admit a serious de­
feat west of Kolomea, where they
were driven back nearly five miles.
Russians Capture 10,000.
The latest official statement frrrfi
the Russian war office announces the
capture of approximately 10,000 addi­
tional prisoners, 5,000 of whom are
said to be Germans taken in a recent
battle on the Dniester.
About 5,W0 other prisoners were
captured on other sections of the
sian fronts. The Germans admit the
withdrawal of General Bothmer's ar­
my in the Tarnopole sector before the
powerful attack of the Russians. They
concede alsb an advance by the Brit­
ish south of Tiehieval, in the western
zone.
Russians Fall Back.
A Petrograd dispatch to the Lon­
don Daily Telegraph says the Rus­
sians have fallen back almost 80
miles in the Bagdad regio.i.
The dfspatch says the pressure of
the Turkish forces was one which
caused the retirement of the Rus­
sians. The Turks are said to have
Fathered a great army so check The
Russian advance. Among those troops
was the force originally destined for
the invasion of Egypt, troops which
had been in Bulgaria and an army of
130,000 men which was withdrawn
from the Salonlki front.
The principal reason, however, giv­
en tor the retreat of the Russians, is
that tfee intense heat in Mesoootamia
makes campaigning very difficult at
this time of the year. It is stated
that the Russians are planning to «s

atic conditions makes the resumption

Sister Boniface of St. Alexius hos­

dormitories will be provided for the

The registration of the school has
been growing. Students have been
coming from many of the neighbor­
ing states. The school has the repu­
tation of maintaining high standards
and of turning out competent office
experts.
A lease was signed for five years
with the option of purchase at the
end of that time.

The quartermaster department to­
day is going to work right, say mili­
tary experts.
The army might get along without
machine guns—it has to, at present—
but can't get along without food
shoes and clothes.
Here are some of the duties of the
quartermaster department:
To give the soldier food and clothes,
his tent and liis jjay, provide movie
shows when there is time for amuse­
ment, run steamships and railroad
trains, dig sew'ers to protect the sol­
diers health, supply water, light and
motor truoks.
The. quartermaster department in
normal times buys 600,000 pairs of
shoes, made according to government
specifications. It operates pla'nt3
here-shoes, clothing, tents and flags
are manufactured.
The supplies accumulated are stor­
ed in depots at Philadelphia, St. Louis
and other points.
To keep all this executive machin­
ery going there are 3,000 officers,
6,000 enlisted men and 9,000 civil em­
ployes. Fourteen officers and 296 ci­
vilians are at work in Washington.

HEAVY RAIN FALL
Fargo, July 6.—A severe wind and
rain storm swept over portions of
eastern 'North Dakota as a climax to
the hottest day in two years. With
all telephone communications cut off
north of Fargo, only indefinite reports
have been received as to the extent of
the storm. The indication is that
Nelson county was in the center of
the storm belt, and a tornado is re­
ported to have swept through a por­
tion of that county. A severe storm
broke over F'argo shortly before mid­
night. No damage was done so far
as reported. Grand Forks had an
electrical storm about 6 o'clock and
since that time no telephone service
has been open. lA heavy rain accom­
panied the storm in most sections.
While complaint is rather general,
there ate four types of merchants
who are not at all peeved by mer­
cury's antics. These are the soda
fountain dispensers, the men's cloth­
iers, the department store owners and
the dealers in electric specialties. One
dealer yesterday reported that he was
out of electric fans and that his ship­
ment on the way was all sold in ad­
vance. Men's clothing stores are
crowded with persons seeking some­
thing that will keep the hot air out
and let the cool air in, and the foun­
tains—they were as packed yesterday
as the hotels were on the Fourth.

storm which swept the east coast
Wednesday and turned inland today.
All the deaths reported up to late
tonight occurred near Beloit, Ala.,
where 17 negroes lost their lives. Sev­
eral resorts along the coast in the vi­
cinity of Mobile had not been heard
from.
There was no loss of life in either
Mobile or Pensacola, the largest cities
in the storm's path, according to mes­
sengers from those places, which still
were cut off from direct wire com­
munication.
The maximum wind velocity was re­
ported at 104 miles an hour.
Property damage at Mobile was re­
ported to be around a million dollars.
The business section of the city was

$200,00. Jackson and Meridian report­
ed considerable damage to crops and
farm ibuildings. Reports from gulf
ports, Pass Christian and Bay St.
Louis, Miss., told of little damage
there, with no loss of life.
Buildings and crops in and around
Veloix and Tallahassee in Alabama
were damaged and crops suffered
throughout the storm area.
Traffic Resumed.
Traffic between New Orleans and
Mobile and Penwacola, over the Louis­
ville & Nashville railroad, which had
been suspended for many hours, was
resumed tonight, trains being sent
out from New Orleans, but railroad
officials were not optimistic that they
would get through, because of wash­
outs and debris reported on the
tracks.
One Louisville & Nashville passen
ger train was reported marooned be
tween New Orleans and Mobile.
HI GUI RESERVES
10 THE COLORS
Washington, July 6.—The war de­

call to the colors, within a few days,
the regular army reserve, consisting
of between 4,000 and 5,000 men who
have served in the army, to hasten
units provided by the army reorgani­
zation act. Those nffected by the or­
der are enlisted men who have been
furloughed into the reserve since No­

active service for three years.
The reserves may be called into act­
ive service under the law in case of
"war or emergency."

FEDERAL PROBC
Washington, July 6.—'Representa­

try's big packing houses were given
a final hearing today by the house
committee considering Senator Bor­
land's resolution for a federal trade
commission investigation of the pack­
ing industry.
Spokesmen for the cattlemen said
an inquiry was necessary to insure
reasonable net prices to consumers.
An array of counsel for the ArmOur,
Swift, Cudahy, Sulzberger and Mor­
ris companies argued that such A pro­
ceeding was unnecessary and wou*fi
be certain to work incalculable haim
to the packing industry. They sub­
mitted masses of testimony and sta­
tistics denying existence or business
practices prohibited by the anti-trust
Jaws.
Action upon the resolution by the
full judiciary committee is expected
shortly. Its next meeting will be held
Tuesday, but the sub-committee's i*
port is not expected by that time.
The hearing, concluded today, began

Waukegan, 111., July 6.—Wm. H. Or
pet, the collegian charged with the
murder of Marian Lambert, left Judge
Donnelly's court room tonight encour­
aged by the unqualified statement of
chemists who went on the witness
stand today in an effort to demolish
the case of the prosecution.
The case for the defense was prac­
tically closed. James H. Wdlkerson,
of Orpet's counsel, said that he might
put on two minor witnesses for brief
testimony tomorrow. Argument of
counsel probably will begin not later
than next Monday, and the case may
go to the jury Wednesday night. Dr.
W. J. MicNally, as a defense witness
today, reversed the testimony which
he gave three weeks ago for the state.
The prosecution relied on his ^testi­
mony and that of Dr. Ralph Webster,
both chemists, to convince the jury
that Marian died of cyanide of potas­
sium in solution form. Both testified
to this as a fact, but today Dr. Mc
'Nally having, conducted further ex-
first testimony
that the powdered poison caused her
death. Dr. Webster was said to be
in Wisconsin on a fishing trip.

Other witnesses were: Dr. W. T.
Wessner, Dr. L. I. Shaw, Dr. Carl Mi­
nor and Dr. John H. Long, all expert
chemists and toxicologists, and Rob­
ert A. Hevenor, a wholesale drug­
gist.
It was brought out that the so-c til­
ed cyanide of potassium, which was
in the greenhouse over which Orpet's
father had charge, was in reality a
cyanide of sodium. All of the chem­
ists examined today agreed on this
and that it contained only a trace,
less than 1 per cent, of cyanide ot
potassium.

Another witness was Dr. O. H.
Krohn, an alienist, who testified that
Marian was of a hysterical type- and
that Orpet's "brain fog" upon sud­
denly finding Marian dead was to be
found in a young man of his kind.
The coffins were taken from the car
and as they were placed in waiting
ambulances, every sight-seer stood,
hat in hand, until they had been cov­
ered with flags and a military band
had sounded the last note of "Nearer
My God to Thee."
Headed by the Eighth Cavalry band
playing the Chopin funeral march, and
and an escort of a squadron of caval­
ry, the cortege moved slowly toward
the city.
General Bell, his staff, the 23 sur­
vivors of Carrizal recently released
at Chihuahua City and the other two
squadrons of the Eighth cavalry made
up the center of the procession.
General Bell announced tonight
that efforts to indentify any of the
bodies other than those of Captain
Charles T. Boyd, Lieut. (Henry Adair
and Private DeWitt Rucker had been
unsuccessful.
From one end of the border to the
other, the thousands of national
guardsmen today settled down to the
routine of camp life and drill. Report
from officers commanding border sta­
tions referred to the movements of
Mexican troops, but told of no raids
or hostile action by the de facto gov­
ernment troops and officers at head­
quarters here.
INSPECTING ROADS.
The county commissioners, who are
in session this week at the court
house, spent the greater part of yes­

parts of the county and the bridges.
Only matters of routine nature have
been taken up this week.

Exhumed from a single grave in an

While the immediate purpose of the
negotiations in which Secretary Lan­
sing's note is to be the rst step will
be the evolution of some plan for
tranquilizing the border region, the
discussion may take on a wider scope.
Carranza Needs Money.
There is little hope that Mr. Arre­
dondo received the impression from
Secretary Lansing today that, if ade­
quate guaranteed as to the security of
American and other foreign interests
in Mexico could be secured, the Wash­
ington government believes it possible
that the financial aid so greatly need­
ed by the de facto government could
be found.
Details of the form and extent of
the guarantees required, and of the
amount and nature of the financial
aid that American bankers might be
willing to furnish, can only be worked
out by a .protracted discussion.
Some time ago, it is understood,
suggestion that the Washington gov­
ernment would encourage American
bankers to go to the rescue of the de
facto government was made through
indirect channels. At that time Gen­
eral Carranza had not felt the pinch
of poverty which now threatens his
government with collapse.
He rejected the suggestion, as he
believed he could restore financial
stability without foreign aid.
Friendly Purpose.
Secretary Lansing would not die*
cuss the terms of the note he will for­
ward to the de facto government ap­
proving the suggestion for direct'di­
plomatic negotiations to find, a eola­
tion of the difficulties in which On
governments have become involved.
It is believed, however, that it wfll
lay great stress upon the friendly pur­
pose of the United States end Inti­
mates that any plan of action /that
may be suggested which will Insure

Washington, July 6.—The delicto
government of Mexico was informally*
notified tonight, throught HUsio Aire*
dondo, ambassador-designate, that
the United States welcomes General
Carranza's proposal to adjust all pend*
ing differences between the two gov­
ernments by direct negotiations.
Mr. Arredondo was informed of the
American government's attitude in a
conversation today with Secretary
Lansing, after the latter had confer
red with President Wilson.
Mr. Lansings virtually had complete
ed a draft of the communication to­
night, but it may be read to the ctbi
net tomorrow before it is delivered..
Immediately after the cabinet meet
ing, Secretary Lansing plans tb leave
for a month's vaeation.
Counsellor Polk will look after af­
fairs in -his absence and meet with.
Mr. Arredondo in. the formal discus-
sions through which a solution of the
Mexican problems will be sought.
Way Out of Qrieie-
It is evident at the vtat't depart­
ment today that officials believe an
opportunity now has been preseiktetf
out of which may come a means Of
giving the de facto government mar
terial aid in restoring order thonrgh
out Mexico. It is known that the pa
cic nature of the Mexican note, which
brought the crisis of the governments
to an end, is construed here-as indi­
cating that General Carranza, besides
being impressed by American military
preparations, has been deeply influ­
enced by the pressure and argument#
broughft to bear on him by friends
in the United States, by European di­
plomats in Mexico, and by the many1
Latin-American powers. The latier
have exerted themselves to the ut­
most to avert war and to foster iu
General Carranza's mind the idea of
Pan-American unity.
