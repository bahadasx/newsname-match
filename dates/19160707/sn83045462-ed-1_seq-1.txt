BERLIN, July 7, via Lon
don, 5:10 p.m.?A salient of
the German line in Volhynia
; projecting toward Czartorysk,
has been abandoned under superior
pressure by the Russians
and a new line of defense se1
lected, it was announced today
1 by the war office.
\ LONDON, July 7, 3 p.m.?A
\ wireless dispatch from Rome says!
I word has been received there
from Petrograd that in consequence
of their triple defeat in
the sectors of Riga. Kolki and
Baranovichi, the Germans have
begun to move their whole front!
toward the west.
Petrograd has recently an- j
nottnced successes in regions
mentioned in the Rome advices.
The last report from the vicinity
of Kolki, in the crucial Volhynia
sector, recorded the capture by
the Russians of more than 7.500
prisoners, half a dozen cannon
and twenty-three machine guns.
Another Offensive Begun.
The Russians have begun a tremendous
offensive on the Riga front, where
their artillery is destroying the German
trenches, says a dispatch to the
Exchange Telegraph Company from
Vienna, via Copenhagen.
The bombardment, the dispatch adds,
lasted twenty-four hours and the Germans
were* helpless before the Russian
artillery, which can now fire fifty shells
as against one in 1914.
Artillery Fire Perfect.
A dispatch to the Morning Post from
Budapest quoted a Hungarian correspondent
at'the eastern front as saying:
"The Russian strength .exceeds anything
seen in this war heretofore. In
some cases they stormed our positions
in rows seventeen lines deep and their
artillery was 60 absolutely perfect that
no troops could dream of standing up
to it.
"Much of their artillery- consists of
Ta..,nAc^. OT.n. rv.onnn/1 Kv -,r>A
French officers. They often employ the
so-called "pouring fire." using ammunition
of Japanese and American origin.
"In some places the Russian barrage
lire continued even after their infantry
reached our trenches and in at least one
spot both defenders and attackers were
totally annihilated. The Russians were
buried under the earthworks wrecked by
their own artillery.
Supplied. With Ammunition.
The Russians, who now apparently have
oven a better supply of guns and ammunition
than their adversaries, seem to
pass from one phase to the next without
intermission. Gen. Letchltzky's army,
which conquered Bukowina and cut the
railway between Delatyn and Korosmezo,
Is advancing in an effort completely to
overcome the Austrian forces on that
front. Gen. Kaledines Is continuing to
deliver heavy strokes against the Austria
ns and Germans who are endeavoring
to keep him from KoveL With these
operations in fhll swing the Russians to j
the north have inaugurated an offensive
from Riga to Garanovichi.
Along the northern end of the line !

has begun, while from a point

elsewhere from the Black sea to the
Persian frontier the Russians, according
to their own statements, are more

army in Mesopotamia,but it is believed
that inactivity was forced by the great
heat.

OKIAHOMA TODAY
' Guardsmen Have Covered
! Nearly Two-Thirds of Journey
to Bisbee.
ALL IN GOOD HEALTH
IN SPITE OF HARD TRIP
Soldiers Are Receiving Instructions
i Daily About Duty on Border, and
Discipline Is Strict.
.
I ? .
BY J. UHUbBY MCUAATni.
Staff Correspondent of The Star.
SHAWNEE, Okla., July 7 (on
board the District National Guard
special train).?Nearly two-thirds
of the distance from the mobilization
camp at Fort Myer, Va., to
the concentration camp at Bisbec.
Ariz., had been traversed by the
first contingent of the District
militia when it reached here at
9:07 o'clock this morning.
Revolvers and cartridges are being
distributed, with instructions to be j
ready for border duty. The officers are
emphatic in warnings not to load the
revolvers while on the train. They are
issuing strict instructions regarding
what the men are to do when they
reach Bisbee.
Men Are Being Instructed.
They are being advised that they
must be prepared to go on duty immediately,
that while they probably will
not be called upon to fight off any raids,
they must be vigilant. In other words,
they are having it impressed upon them
that they are to enter Bisbee ready for
serious work, and that the camp is not
to be the scene of an outing, but that
they are there to perform a specific and
serious duty for the government. The
camp discipline is to be very strict.
None of the more than 500 men comprising
the Field Hospital. Signal
Corps and l'st Separate Battalion (colored),
which are on this special train,
is suffering from any form of illness,
despite the hot. dirty trip and the close
atmosphere of the crowded train. They
are all in excellent spirits, which are
rising constantly as they come nearer
to the end of their train journey.
Weather Ideal, Everybody Happy.
So far the trip of the SlgmaJ Corp#
and the Field Hospital unit of the District
National Guard to Blsbee, Ariz.,
has been as enjoyable as could be expected'
under the circumstances The
weather Is ideal and everybody seems
to be happy.
The country through which the train
is passing is new to the majority of
the members of both units, and most
of the time is being spent by the
guardsmen looking out of the car windows.
A lot of letter writing Is being done,
and since the train pulled out of Rosslyh,
Va., hundreds of post cards have
been addressed and mailed. At every
point the train stops a bundle of mail
matter is thrown off to the station master
or some other person on the platform
with the request that it be placed
in a man dox.
The coaches in which the guardsmen
are riding are quite antiquated, and
they careen from one side to the other
like a ship at sea. This makes it very
hard for the cooks and those assigned
to help them. Cooking is dangerous
work under the circumstances, for one
has to be extremely careful to avoid
being thrown against the cooking
ranges by the lurching of the train.
Often the contents of the pots and pans
on the stove splash over, and the cooks
have to jump to keep from being
scalded.
Have Difficulty in Shaving.
Some of the wiser members of the
"bunch" wait until the train stops at
s^me station to take on ice and water
before attempting to shave. Some
have cut their faces in their attempt to
shave while the train is in motion.
P. E. Padgett of the Field Hospital
Company is an expert barber and he
has had plenty to do for the last few
hours. No matter how much the train
rocks he has no difficulty in shaving
his comrades. When the train stopped
at Knoxville he rigged up a chair on
one of the flat cars bearing the wire
reels and transport wagons and shaved
several militiamen. He had an audience
of a hundred or more persons who
were waiting to board a local train.
Members of the signal and field hospital
units are mighty sorry to have
been forced to leave the Fort Myer
camp without their pay. Just how long
it will be before their pay reaches Bisbee
no one on the train knows. Some
of the men are far from being "flush"
and they are getting a bit anxious
about the situation.
This afternoon surgeons of the field
hospital company are busy giving members
of their unit and of the Signal
Corps their second "shot" of the typhoid
prophylactic. Some of the surgeons
were in readiness to take their third
snoi * apt. w 11 nam 13. nuason, t;apt. I
C. M. Pollman and Capt. J. B. Bog an
handled the "needles."
Administering the anti-typhoid vaccine
was no easy task on the train.
One of the sections was temporarily
transformed into a miniature operat!
ing room. An alcohol stove was set
I up on a chest to heat water in which
i to sterilize the hypodermic syringes.
; The surgeons could not make the
I speed that characterized their work
! when they vaccinated the men at Camp
! Ordway.
Olad of Chance for Exercise.
j At several stations the men have filed
| out of the train to take a little exer'
cise. The "stretch your legs" order
has become a welcome command on the
train.
At every place the militiamen have
left the train they have been the re- (
clpients of many compliments on the
part of the townspeople.
"The neatest, cleanest cut and best
behaved soldiers that Zisre passed
through here since the mobilization
i began." has been the universal verdict
Everywhere. Prominent citizens
of a number of towns singled out the
officers commanding the units and
spoke in very complimentary terms of
the men. e
TOLL OF INFANTILE
PARALYSISGROWS
City, State and Federal Authorities
of New York Fighting
Disease Unavailingly.
TWENTY-TWO MORE DIE
IN IWtNl T-hUUH HUUttS
Epidemic Shows Little Signs of
Abatement, Eighty-Seven New
Cases Being B?pwted.
NEW YORK. July 7.?With city, state
and federal authorities fighting the disease,
the epidemic of infantile paralysis
showed little signs of abatement
today. During the twenty-four hours
ended at 10 o'clock this morning twenty-two
more children died. Nineteen of
this number succumbed in Brooklyn.
There were eighty-seven new cases reported.
Public Health Service to Aid.
After a conference participated in by
William G. McAdoo, Secretary of the
Treasury of the United States; Mayor
Mitchel, Health Commissioner Emerson
and others, it was announced last night
that the United States public health
service would co-operate with the New
York authorities in their efforts to
stamp out the epidemic of infantile paralysis
which already has cost the livejf
of more than 150 children.
The federal aid, it was said, would be
directed at once to tracing the origin
of the disease. This will consist largely
in field epidemiological and laboratory
studies, the latter being chiefly experiments
with animal inoculations. In
this connection, it was said, a telegram
had been sent to Washington asking
that 100 monkeys, procured in the
Philippines for the Rockefeller InstiI
tute of Medical Research here, be not
subjected to a recent embargo order
which has delayed their arrival into
er Emerson, monkeys are regarded as
the best possible animal mediums thus
far discovered for proving the transmission
of the disease.
Anxious to Find Disease Carriers.
Commissioner Emerson asserted that
the health department is anxious to
find, if possible, the so-called carriers i
of the disease, since this seems to be
the information necessary to enable
the authorities to control it. The federal
health officers, he said, are able to
handle this phase much more thoroughly
than could be done locally, because
of the fact that the government
workers are specially trained and frequently
deal with similar problems. |
All hospitals, it was said, will be asked
to send material from fatal cases
of infantile paralysis to the department
of health for examination and research.
Commissioner Emerson said:
"We are doing and have done absolutely
everything we can to prevent
the spread of infantile paralysis. If it
is not checked I do not know what else j
can be done, and I fear it will have '
to run its course. I am not confident
that the epidemic is being controlled.
From our experience with other epidemics
I look forward to it running
through the summer months."
Maryland Child Succumbs. 1
BALTIMORE, Md.. July 7.?A two
year-old child or Lithuanian parents j
living; near Annapolis Junction, Md.,
died of infantile paralysis at a hospital
*here today. So far as is'know this is
the only case of the disease in Baltimore.
1
New Cases Outside New York City.
ALBANY, N. Y., July 7.?Eight new
cases of infantile paralysis in sections '
of the state outside of Greater New
York were reported to the state health
department up to noon today. This
brings the total number of cases outside
of New York up to forty-five. The
new cases were reported today as follows:
Two at Yonkers, and one each at
Dutchess Junction, Warwick, Jasper,
Hornell. Copiague and Glen Cove.
The department today sent letters to
the presidents of all railroads in the
state requesting that especial care be
taken in disinfecting all cars that carry
children from New York. Local health
officers were instructed today to see
that glasses at soda fountains and
other public gathering places were
thoroughly cleansed and disinfected
after use. 1

Murdered In a dense woods last nigtit j
about 200 yards from his home, Michl- J
gran avenue and Sargent road north- j
east. Brookland, D. C., thet body of
Clarence Keefer, twenty-six years old.
was discovered this morning. He had
been shot twice in the breast. Tne police
are searching for a man and woman
who. they believe, can throw 'some
light on the tragedy.
The murder was discovered by C. L?.
Reiser, a member of No. 6 truck company
of the District fire department,
and a half-brother of the dead man,
during a search for Keefer. The body
was found in the woods about 100
yajrds from Michigan avenue and just
a short distance from the Bunker Hill
Public School.
Keefer was sitting on the porch of
his home about 9 o'clock last night
talking with his mother, Mrs. B. E.
Banfield. when a couple passed. The
man was wearing a Palm Beach suit
and the woman was attired in a shirt
waist and black skirt, the police were
told. ^After the couple had gone up
the road a short distance and entered
the woods, Keefer told his mother he
intended to follow them. He did so.
The motner saw him enter the woods
and that was the last seen of him alive.
Search Is Instituted.
"When Keefer had not returned home
this morning hjs mother became alarmed
and informed Reiser, who, with H.
A. Hodgson, who conducts a blacksmith
shop nearby, started out to search
for the missing man.
The men entered the woods and separated.
Reiser said he took a course ih
which he had seen couples on other
occasions follow. He had gone about
100 yards into the woods when in dense
underbrush he saw the body of Keefer.
He was lying on his face. Believing
Keefer had fallen down and was injured
or asleep, Reiser caught hold of
his hand. It was cold. He became
frightened and immediately sought
Hodgson, who made an examination
and discovered that Keefer had been
shot.
A telephone message was sent t* the
tenth precinct police station. Capt. Judge,
in command, informed Chief of Detectives
Grant, who dispatched Detectives
Weber, Armstrong. Boyle and Stringfellow
to the scene in an automobile. Capt.
Judge also sent a number of his officers
to the place.
A search was made by the police of
the woods in the vicinity of the crime.
Their search resulted in finding a cheap
hatpin, containing a number of brilliants,
a car ticket, collar button and a cheap
fraternity ring. All of the articles were
picked up within a few feet of the spot
where the body was found. Although the
twigs and underbrush showed some signs
of having been disturbed there was no
indication that a struggle had occurred.
Several Heard Shots Fired.
Following the search of the woods
the officers then made a house-to-house
[canvass in the vicinity to learn if any
one had heard the shots fired. Albert
I Hodister. residing: at 16 Michigan avenue,
told the officers that about 9:15
; o'clock last night he heard shots fired,
j He did not see any one in the vicinity
immediately before or after the shoot[ing.
Other residents in the neighborl
hood also heard two shots, but, believing
them to be some distance away,
'did not make an investigation.
The couple who Keefer had told his j
mother he intended to follow into the
wood? were not seen to emerge from
them.
Believing the couple Keefer had followed
possibly had gone to the place on
a Brookland line car which arrived at
Michigan avenue and 12th street northeast,
the terminus, about 9 o'clock last
night, the detectives are endeavoring to
locate the crew of the car to possibly get
a description of any couples who might
have boarded the car near there. They
also are endeavoring to learn if any couple
answering the description given by
the mother of the murdered man took a
car for the city later in the night.
The body of Keefer was removed to
the District morgue in the tenth precinct
patrol and an inquest will be held probably
tomorrow.

BRITISH CAPTURE
GERMAN TRENCH,
LONDONREPORTS
Front of 1,000 Yards East of
La Bolsselle Taken in Resuming
Offensive.
GAINS AT OTHER POINTS
ANNOUNCED OFFICIALLY
Second Phase of Great Battle on
Western Front Begins With
Heavy Bombardment.
RESULTS PLEASING TO FRENCH
Defensive Fighting Gives Satisfaotion,
as It Shows Allies Are Able
to Hold Positions When
They Are Won.
LONDON, July 7, 2:46 p.m.?
Capture by the British of a German
trench on a front of 1,000
yards east of La Boisselle, in the
Somme region, was announced
officially today.
The British resumed the offensive
on certain sectors east of
Albert at dawn today.
At the same time the German#
launched heavy attacks on the
British trenches near Ancre.
Violent fighting is now in
progress.
In the vicinity of Ovillers and
Contalmaison, as well as near
La Boisselle, the British made
progress. In the region of
Thiepval the Germans regained
a section of lost ground.
Second Phase of Battle Begnn.
The second phase of the great battle on
the western front has now begun. The
artillery has been brought up to new positions
and is again battering the German
defenses. The bombardment extends as
far northward as La Bassee and Armentieres,
and. according to the latest unof
ficial advices, is particularly intense.
British long-range guns are shelling the
German positions and the roads in their
rear, and, until the infantry again leaves
the trenches, it will be uncertain where
the next attacks are to be launched.
In addition to inflicting losses on the
Germans in men, guns and territory, the
Anglo-French offensive is reported to
have compelled them to withdraw some
of their forces from the Verdun front.
Consequently, it is expected in London
that the army army for nearly five month*
withstood the German attacks in that
region will have some relief from continual
fighting.
BrussilofF Method Put to Test.
PARIS, July 7, 12:10 a.m.?The solidity
of the French conquest in Picardy
at last has been put to the test, and
military men here say it has come out
of the ordeal with flying colors, thus
again demonstrating the soundness of
the Brussiloff method.
The Germans, who managed to gather
considerable forces, partly, apparently*
from the British front, where the pressure
was lessened during the day, and
partly from depots, delivered a series of
violent attacks on two points. Th#
I first of these was between Hem and
i Maricourt, on the Clery road. The sec|
ond was on the extreme right, between
Estrees and Belloy, their object being
to drive a wedge between the French
center and right, where the French line
crosses the Somme river, from Hem to
| Feuilleres, and between the extreme
| right and the rest of the French front,
i The success of these maneuvers
would have forced the eventual retire
ment or the whole * renoh line. The
(ierman reaction, however, came too
late.
Caught in Whirlwind of Fire.
The French had time thoroughly to
strengthen their line, to advance and
place in position heavy artillery and to
bring up plentiful stocks of munitions.
Consequently the attacking wave was
caught in a whirlwind of machine gun
Are from the trenches and was shot to
pieces by the "seventy-fives," while the
German supports following and reserves
far in the rear were shattered *
by salvos from medium and heavy
batteries.
The German infantry plodded forward
again and again, but nowhere,-French
reports say. made any impression upon
the French linos.
Flare ly even did they get to grips
with the occupants of the trenches,
which accounts for the small number
of prisoners taken. The Germans, say
the reports, had striven the whole day
without effecting the slightest modification
of the situation.
The French remain two and a half
miles from l'eror.ne on the south side
of the Somme and four miles from that
city on the north side of the river, and
there are no formidable natural obstacles
in the way of their occupation
of the city when the French commander
judges that the time is rine to do so.
Able to Hold Positions.

given almost as much satisfaction to
the French as the previous day's captures,
for, they say, it has clearlyshown
that the entenfe allies not onlyare
able to win positions from the Germans
wherever they like, but also are
able to hold those positions when won.
The first German counter attack was
launched in the night in the Hem section,
north of the canalized Somme
river. The Germans succeeded in carrying
two small woods situated south
of the Clery-Mericourt road, a few
hundred yards from the sugar works
bordering that road.
The French troops there, being more
or ess in the air, fell back on the village.
and, swinging their left wing
slightly, captured another small wood
