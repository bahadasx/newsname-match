RUSSIAN-JAP
TREATY ENDS
LONG STRIFE
New Agreement Formed by
Two Powers Regarded of
Great Importance.
U. S. NOT AFFECTED
Foreign Office Asserts Amer
ican Trade Is in No Way
Changed by Pact.
Tokio, July 7. The Japanese foreign
office today announcer) as the sub
stance of the Russo-Japanese conven
tion signed at Petrograd on July 3,
the following:
First Japan will take part in no
arrangements or political combination
directed against Russia. Russia will
take part in no arrangement or politi
cal combination directed against Japan.
Second In case tiie territorial rights
or special interests in the far east of.
one of the contracting parties, which!
are recognized by the other contract-!
ing parties are menaced. Japan and i
Ru.-sia will consult with each other
cm measures to adopt with a view to i
supporting or extending assistance for
the safeguarding and defense of these
rights and interests.
American Trade Unaffected.
To a question from The Associated
Tress representative as to what effect
the alliance would have upon the open
door and the integrity of China, the
foreign office replied:
"The convention is effectually an
emphasis upon and an extension of
the Anglo-Japanese alliance based up
on the territorial integrity of China,
whose open door and integrity are
jiow endangered. American trade and
Interests are in no wise affected."
The foreign office denied affirma
tions in Japanese newspapers" that the
convention contained secret clauses,
declaring that, while the summary
given out was the substance of the
convention it also was virtually the
text of that document.
The accord, which is virtually an
alliance, is regarded here as of historic
importance as concerns the future de
velopment of the far east and world
politics generally. It ends a long per
iixl of hostility between the two em
pires, which culminated in the Russo
Japanese war and strengthens the po
sition of Japan as a first class power.
EPIDEMIC GAINS;

Two More Children Fall Victims of
Infantile Paralysis Grows Alarm
ing in ew York.
Springfield. 111., July 7. Two more
cases of infantile paralysis were re
ported to the Illinois state board of
health today, bringing the total num
ber of cases in the state outside of
Chicago to nine. The cases reported
today are at Kankakee, and near Ore
gon, Ogle county.
A report from the board's investi
gator at Standard, where four cases
were discovered on July 4, today said
he had thus far been unable to locate
the origin of the infection. These
were the first cases reported in Illi
nois outside of Chicago.
New York, July 7. With city, state
and federal authorities fighting the
disease, the epidemic of infantile par
alysis showed little signs of abatement
today. During the 21 hours ending at

the Untied Stat, s public health service
were ordered to New York City today

health authorities in suppressing the
epidemic
DECLARES MUSIC
APPEALS TO NOSE
Chicago, July 7. Music appeals to
the nasa! rather than to the auditory
nerves, according to Robert W. Ste
vens, director of music of the Univers
ity of Chicago, who told students in an
address yesterday that "music hath
charms to sooth the sense of smell."
He says a series of experiments has
proved this fact to him.
The Sousa. march, according to Mr.
Stevens has a piercing sharp odor.
"Carmen" music is designated as "in
vigorating"; "Thais" is like the scent
''f perfume and "Sampson" smells to
llr. Stevens like onions.
To Pay Americans Decorated.
Paris, July 7. The Franco-American
flying corps has decided to pre
eent money prizes to members of the
corps upon whom war decorations
have been conferred. rive hundred
francs will be given for the cross of
war, 1,000 francs for the military medal
Rxid 1,000 francs for the legion of honor.
T exits Raise
Protest at
Fo odBureau
The Hague, July 7, (via London,
10:40 a. rn.) Information reaches The
Hague that for several weeks there
has been continuous friction between
the authorities of various large Ger
man cities and the central purchasing
bureau. The municipalities claim the
right to buy their own food and house
hold articles without asking permis
sion of the central bureau.
"There was an outburst last week In !
the Hanover city council, several mem- !
bers of which accused the central bu-
reau of boycotting the city, which was i
unable to procure butter, sausage and
hams, notwithstanding that some !
places in the vicinity were sufficiently
supplied. It was argued that it was
physically impossible for one bureau
to control all muncipalities.
Cologne, Dresden, Chemnitz and oth
er cities already are purchasing sup
plies independently, having represent
atives in Holland for that purpose.
As potatoes are scarce in Germany,
while the rye supply is sufficient
Adolph von Batocki, head of the food
regulation board has decided it will
not be necessary to mix potato meal in
war bread.
A census of rubber stocks has re
vealed large quantities in the frontier
districts, supposedly smuggled into the
country. The central bureau has
seized all this rubber, paying for it at
the rate of five marks a kilogram. .
The bureau for the protection of
German mercantile credits abroad has
issued lists of certified German claims
on foreign debtors and admitted for
eign claims on German firms for the
purpose of facilitating settlements of
balances. These lists are free to ap
proved neutral firms.
THE WAR TODAY
A German retreat all alone the
line of the front in Russia from
Riga to Volhjnia is reported to
day. I nofficial news to this effect
comes from I'etrogTad through
Rome. It declares that a triple de
feat for the Germans in the Riga,
Kolki and Baranovinchi sectors
cansed them to begin a movement
of their whole front westward.
. a'eUan-caattCS!??
nounceo successes in otivus men
tioned in the Rome advices. The
last report from the vicinity of
holki in the crucial Volhjnia sec
tor, recorded the capture by the
Russians of more than 7,500 pris
oners, half a dozen cannon and 2IJ
machine guns.
A great battle Is raging along
virtually the entire front of the
British offensive in northern
France.
At daybreak the British launch
ed a new drive east of Albert- Im
portant tactical successes were
gained in several sectors, London
an no unci s.
The Germans simultaneously at
tacked in force near the river An.
ere and north of Fricourt. They
succeeded in temporarily occupy
ing two or three hundred yards of
ground lost in the earlier British
drives.
The chief advantages gained by
the Rritish were in the vicinity of
O fillers, Contalmaison and La
Boisselle.. Aear the last named
place in an engagement last night
a German trench more than half a
mile in length was captured.
Meanwhile the French, both
north and south of the Somme in
the field of the great allied offens
ive, are resting on the ground
won in their notable advances of
the List week.
There is a complete lull in the
fighting about Verdun so far as
the infantry is concerned but artil
lery actions on the right bank of
the 3Ieuse, north of the cHadel are
still violent.
Both French and British are
consolidating their positions and
making preparations to renew the
great bombardment which preced
ed the first rush at the battle of
the Somme. In the beginning the
Germans concentrated their force
asrainst the British, apparently
considering operations of the
French to the south as of small
significance. But the rapid French
advance, together with the import
ance of the objective for which
they are aiming, has changed the
German view and has caused the
German commanders to strength
en their defenses and forces along
the line guarding I'eronne and
other important strategic points.
.Vo advances on either side are
reported around Verdun, although
heavy bombardment is kept np.
The tremendous proportions of
the Russian drive against the Ans
trians and Germans during the
last month are shown by an unoffi
cial statement from I'etroerad
which savs the losses of the Teu
tonic allies total nearly half a
million men, abont half of whom
are prisoners. About 250 guns and
700 machine guns, in addition to
immense quantities of war stores
have fallen into Kussian hands.
The Aostrians admit serious de
feat west of Kolomea, where they
were driven back five miles.
The Kussian war office announ
ce the capture of 10,00 prisoners
vesterday, W0 in a battle on the
Dniester and .1.000 on other sec
tions of the Kussian front-
The Germans admit the with
drawal of General von Bothmer's
army in the Tarnopol region he
fore the Kussian attacks. They
concede also an advance by the
British south of Thiepval in the
western zone.
FORMAL NOTE
GIVEN ENVOY
OF GARRAN2A
Official Acceptance of Mexi
can Proposal Set Forth
in Communication.
CABINET ACTS ON IT
Document Is Discussed by
President and Advisers
Before Delivery.
Washington. Jnly 7. A note for
mally accepting General Car
ranza's proposal that differences
between the Tinted States and the
de facto government of Mexico lie
settled by direct negotiations, was
handed today to Lliseo Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador desig
nate. Secretary Lansing took a draft of
the note to today's cabinet meeting and
had it delivered promptly after the
cabinet adjourned. The course to be
pursued already had been agreed upon
by President Wilson and his advisers.
To Give Financial AidI
The proposed exchange of views
probably will be carried on through
informal conversations between Mr.
Arredondo anil Counselor Polk, who
will act as secretary of state while Mr.
Lansing is away on a month's vacation
at Watertown, N. Y.
While high officials have admitted
that the Washington government in all
probability would do what it could to
encourage American bankers to go to
the aid of the de facto government if
General Carranza would furnish prop
er guarantees. Counselor Pook took oc
casion today to state that his confjjjT,
ence yesterday with Henry T. Fletcher.
iiTftbssatlor-desigTiate to Mexico and
-m. Warburg of the federal reserve
board had nothing to do with this as
pect of the situation.
Officials Reticent.
Department officials indicated it was
too early to forecast clearly what
might be evolved from the more favor
able aspects of the Mexican situation
presented by General Carranza's re
cent amicable note.
No detailed plan as to the form of
guarantees the United States may seek
for the safety of its own and other
foreign interests in Mexico has been
formulated so far as yet.
Text of 'otc
The text follows:
"Mr. Secretary: I have the honor
to acknowledge the receipt of your
courteous note transmitted to me by
Senor Arredondo on the 4th inst. in
which you refer to my notes of June
20 and June 25, and to assure you of
the sincere gratification of my gov
ernment at the frank statement of the
difficulties which have unfortunately
arisen in our relations along the inter
national boundary and the unreserved
expression of the desire of your gov
ernment to reach an adjustment of
these difficulties on a broad and ami
cable basis. The same spirit of friend
ship and of solicitude for the continu
ance of cordial relations between our
two countries inspires my government
which earnestly desires an immediate
solution of the matters of differences
which have long vexed both govern
ments. "It is especially pleasing to my gov
ernment that the de facto government
of Mexico is disposed to give quick as
well as practical consideration in a
spirit of concord to the remedies
which may be applied to the existing
conditions. Reciprocating the same de
sire, the government of the United
States is prepared immediately to ex
change views as to a practical plan to
remove finally and prevent a recur
rence of the difficulties which have
been the source of the controversy.
"Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed
assurrances of my highest considera
tion. "I am, sir,
"Yours very sincerely,
(Signed) "KOBERT LANSING."

During the past week the British on
thewestern front have shown that they
as well as the Germans have fighting
qualities. Important gains have been
made, and the end is apparently not
yet. The British armies are under the
command of Sir Douglas Haig, and one
of his ablest generals is General Sir
Wolf Murray, K. C. B., R. A. The open
ing of the war found the British with
inferior guns. This inferiority has
slowly been overcome, and the British
artillery isow reported to be equal
to that of their foes.
FRITZI SCHEFF IS
DIVORCE FACTOR
PopnlftTPm DonB' and Wine

ment td'Stefndel Troubles.
Chicago, July 7. Fritzi Scbeff and
champagne were contributing factors
to the discord in the musical family of
Steindel, according to the testimony of
Mrs. Charlotte Steindel yesterday be
fore Judge Kersten.
Until last August the Steindel house
hold comprised Mrs. Steindel, now di
rector of the orchestra at . the Fine
Arts theater; Ferdinand Bruno Stein
del, pianist, now in vaudeville; and
their baby daughter, Lucille.
Fritzi Scheff, the Viennese prima
donna, was only one of a number of
women of Bohemian temperaments
with whom her husband liked to dine
and drink, Mrs. Steindel said.
"We quarreled all the time because
he spent his money and failed to pay
the household bills," said Mrs. Stein
del. "When I reproached him for
spending his money on champagne for
other women he would strike me. It
got so bad that he beat me daily.
"Once he dragged me out of bed,
threw me into the parlor and refused
to let me back into the bedroom to
sleep that night. I left him twice be
fore we finally separated, but there
was a reconciliation each time and
he signed an agreement to be good."
Steindel is a nephew of Bruno Stein
del, cellist with the Chicago Symphony
orchestra, and has appeared as pianist
at a number of the orchestra's con
certs. Mrs. Steindel asked the court for
custody of her two-year-old daughter.
Judge Kersten indicated he would
grant a decree.
NO EVIDENCE TO
SHOW VILLA ALIVE
El Paso, Tex., July 7. The Villa
forces have evacuated Jiminez and
railway communication has been es
tablished with Mexico City, according
to a message received today by Gen
eral Gonzales at Juarez from General
Trevino at Chihuahua City. General
Trevino reported that Carranza cav
alry now is in pursuit of the bandits.
Andres Garcia, the Mexican consul
at El Paso, said today that from re
ports received at the army headquar
ters in Juarez, the Villa bandits oper
ating near Jiminez are under the. com
mand of Ealixto Contreras. No evi
dence whatever has been received, he
added, to show that Villa is with the
band or even that he is alive.

Berlin, July 7, (via London, 3:03
p. m.) Official announcement was
made today that the British steamship
Lestris was held up by German war
hsips near the English coast and
seized as a prize.
The statement says the Lestris was
held up "by a portion of the German
high sea forces."
The announcement follows:
"The British steamship) Lestris,
from Liverpool, has been held up by
a portion of the German high sea
forces not far from the English coast
and seized as a prize."
The wording of the German state
ment indicates that a part, at least,
of the German high sea fleet was near
the English coast at the time the
Lestris was seized.
The Lestris is a steamship of 1,384
tons gross, owned in Cork.
This is the second exploit of the
kind on the part of the Germans. On
Jane 16 the British steamship Brussels
was captured by German destroyers
and taken with her passengers into
Zeebrugge.

Troops Mobilized at Camp Dodge Will
Entrain for Border Unit by Unit
on Receipt of Order.
Camp Dodge, Iowa, July 7. The
Iowa national guard, mobilized here
and held pending receipt of orders
from the war department will move to
the Mexican border unit by unit, it was
learned today. Present plans call for
the transportation southward of the
cavalry and artillery first, then the in
fantry and hospital corps units, ac
cording to statements made by officers
in charge of the movement of troops.
Officers today refused to discuss pub
lished assertions that the entire Iowa
brigade would be held up pending the
recruiting of sufficient cavalry men to
bring the squadron up to minimum
peace strength. However, Brigadier
General H. A. Allen, commanding, an
nounced that he had sent appeals to
several cities in the state, asking that
the utmost efforts be made to obtain
enlistments in the cavalry units. They
have been virtually no cavalrymen en
listments for the past two days and
two score men still are needed to fill
the peace quota.
Officers in charge of the traffic ar
rangements expressed the opinion to
day that it may be a week or more be
fore the order comes to move. The
mobilization of guardsmen of other
states and their transfer to stations on
tho lKrder have, it was said, depleted
the supply of tourist sleepers so that
to transport the men at once would
mean a long tiresome ride in day
coaches.
General Allen said today he was un
willing to force this hardship on his
men unless there wa3 urgent need and
it is believed he has asked that orders
to move be delayed until suitable cars
are available in a sufficient number to
take care of the troops.
ARLINGTON TO BE

It is expected the bodies of the seven
