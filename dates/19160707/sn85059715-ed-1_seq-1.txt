LONDON", July 7.?Capture by the
British of a German trench on a front

FridayThe
British resumed the offensive1,
on certain sectors east of Albert at

Germans launched heavy attacks on
the British trenches near Ancre. Violent
lighting is now In progress.
British Make Progress.
In the vicinity of Ovillcrs and Contalmaison,
as well as near La Bolselle,'

of Thlepval the Germans regained
a section of lost ground.
The second phase of the great hattlo
on the western front has now be-1
gun. The artillery has beon brought j
up to new positions and is again bat-'
tering the German defenses. The bom-1
bardmont extends as far northward as
La Ilassee and Armcntleros and, according
to the latest unotficlal advices, \
Is particularly Intense. British long1
range guns arc shelling the German;
i positions and the roads in their rear
I and until the Infantry again leaves the
trench It will be uncertain where the
next attacks are to he launched.
Germans Withdraw.
In addition to inflicting losses on
the Germans in men, guns and territory,
the Anglo-French offensive is re
ported to have compelled them to |
withdraw some of their forces from I
the Verdun front. Consequently It is
Bxpected that the army which has for
Ave months withstood the German at-,
tacks In that region will have some;
relief.
On the eastern front the Russians,
who now apparently have an even better
supply of guns and ammunition
than their adversaries, seem to pass

troops in the fighting at the Somme
brings to light many curious facts,

The luxury of the arrangements

occupied by the battery mentioned
were a piano, a brass bedstead,
and a complete hot and cold water
supply.
The greatest boot fell to General
Balfourtor's famous "Iron corps,"

This corrs took enough material to
