Defense Is Staggered.
After all the talk about deadly pois
ons, it was the most inoffensive drug in
the world that proved the defense's
final sensation yesterday in the Orpet
trial at Waiukegan.
Sodium—the homely, stuff that you
swallow in quantities every time you
season your breakfast eggs with com
mon table salt—made a dramatic en
trance on the scene. Sodium has not
figured before in the inquiry into the
death of Marian Lambert. No one had
the slightest idea that it might turn up
to knock the underpinning from one of
the state's most cherished contentions.
But it did.
James H. Wilkerson. chief of counsel
for Orpet, put four men on the stand to
tell the jury something about the cya
nide which Edward Orpet, the ac
cused boy's father, kept in a green
house for use on the McCormlck estate.
Three of the four were expert chemists,
the fourth a drug salesman.
The state has laid emphasis repeat
edly on this "Orpet cyanide." Will Or
pet slept In the garage, near the green
house, the night before he met Marian
Lambert. He had free access to the
poison. Soon after Marian's death the
boy's father removed all of it and threw
it on an ash heap.
That Will made a solution of this
cyanide and used it to bring about Mar
ian's death has been implied repeatedly.
Not Potassium Cyanide.
But the three experts and the drug
salesman calmly testified to a surpris
ing thing. With the utmost unanimity
they declared that the substance in the
Orpet greenhouse was not potassium
cyanide at all, but sodium cyanide. It
Wa,s potassium cyanide that killed Mar
ian Lambert.
The unexpected testimony cut two
ways. It appeared to demolish, once
and for all, the possibility that Will Or
pet committed the murder with his
father's poison, for no sodium cyanide
was reported when the contents of the
dead girl's stomach were analyzed. And
it attacked the authority of Dr. Ralph
W V/cbstsr's crucial tcstlniony *or the
state, for he had declared under oath
that the substance ln the Orpet green
house was "49 per cent potassium cya
nide."
Weaker Than Potassium.
To be sure, sodium cyanide is a
poison, and Marian Lambert might
have swallowed it. Moreover, It us
ually contains an extremely small
amount of potassium. So, just to show
what would have happened ln that
case, Mr. Wilkerson asked Carl S. Min-»
er, proprietor of the Miner laboratories,
how much the girl would have had to
swallow ln solid form to produce the
3.99 grains of poison found ln her stom
ach.

Washington, July 7.—Forecasts of
final production of the country's prin
cipal farm crops this year were an-
nounced 1.1 \y by the department o"
agriculture's bureau of crop estimates,
basing Its calculation upon the condi
tion of the crops on July 1. Indications
are that the wheat crop this year will
be several million bushels less than It
was last year when for the first time in
the history of the nation the entire
year's wheat crop exceeded the billion
bushel mark. Some other crops also
will be smaller than they were last
year. That is due principally to a re
duction ln acreage. Winter wheat shows
a decrease of 18.6 per cent in acreage,
spring wheat, a reduction of 8.2 per
cent oats, less than 1 per cent de
crease barley, an Increase of 4.9 per
cent, and rye, a docrease of 4.4. per
cent.
The forecasts, ln millions of bushels,
