T7i Tyranny 0f ,fte Telephone
While one half of the world
rightfully exults over the useful-
i ness of the telephone, the other
half groans under its despotism.
The ingenuity of man has anni-
I hilated time and space. The
miracle of science has brought
tnings lar or lorgot so near
that there is no escaping them.
New York can converse with

an our mends and acquaintances
can converse with us whether
we want them to or not. The
postman comes two or three or
four times a day. His advent
can be reckoned with. Tele
grams are expensive things and
have always been kept within
limits. But the telephone, like
death, has all " seasons for its
own. Early risers call up their
sleeping friends, and people who
go to bed late rouse from their
dreams the sluggards who go to
bed early. Dinner time has be
come the prey of acute calculat
ors who want to make sure of
finding us at home; and if vv
dine with friends, the chances
are that we are tracked to our
lair and summoned by an im
perious mandate from the table.
The doctor whom we are consult
ing turns from our most cher
ished symptoms to answer the
telephone; the dentist leaves us
at a crucial moment, happy in
the knowledge that, whatever
we may teel, we are unable to
ntter our sentiments.
To economize time and effort
at the expense of our neighbor's
time and effort has become an
rt. To impose ourselves upon
jur neighbor in his unguarded
noments is to reap all the ad-
Vantages of a sortie. Our grand
parents thought the post a too

How to Make Good Corn Yields
It is hard for some to under
stand why it is so difficult to pro
duce 50 bushels of com per acre,
while many reported yields of 'JOG
bushels per acre are made. No
state makes an average yield of
50 bushels per acre, and the
average of the South is below '20
bushels the acre; yet, the extreme
ly large yields are generally re
ported from the South.
When more than 50 bushels per
acre are grown, or when as much
as 100 bushels the acre are pro
duced, all conditions must be
favorable. The larger the increase
above 50 bushels per acre the
more uniformly favorable must be
all the conditions which affect the
yield.
There are many factors which
influence the yield of corn: seed,
variety, cultivation, fertilizers,
soil, rainfall, etc.
Soil fertility and rainfall are
the two factoid which exert the
most influence in limiting the
yields of corn. Xitrogen and
water are the two special limit
ing L ) i.:a seem to hold the
a vera i below 50 bushels
per acre. Before corn will become
a profitable crop in the South, the
yield must be doubled. TJjis can
not be economically done by the
use of commercial lertilizer.
Xeither can it be done under our
present idea3 and methods of
feeding the soil. It is necessary
to plow under legume crops, not
one, but at least two or three dur
ing as many years, to quickly in
crease the yields. A crop of
crimson clover plowed under each
year and followed by corn will, in
three or four years, double the
yields. Uy this means alone can
the nitrogen be quickly and econ
omically supplied and conditions
made that will hold the required
moieture for a large yield. 4Sorn
is tne one crop tnac requires our
richest soils and for which soils
do not become too rich. Stable
manure would produce similar re
sults, but a ton of crimson clover
hay contains as much nitrogen as
four or five tons of stable manure.
The crimson clover can be had
with small trouble and expense
and is available to all. Twenty
five cents worth of seed sowed
this fall will produce enough seed
to sow several acres next fall, so
there is no excuse for failure to
sow crimson clover on account of
the cost.
It is often given as an excuse
by those who do not sow such
legumes as crimson clover, that
they cauuot afford the cost of the
seed.
This is purely an excuse, but in
no sense a reason. A small start
can be made, seed produced, and
the acreage increased without iu
any way reducing the acreage in
corn. The man who continues to
grow 20 bushels of corn per acre
year after year does so purely be
cause he docs not want to grow
more. In three or four years he
can increase the yield to 40
bushels per acre, and never miss
a crop of corn, if he will save and
sow crimson clover seed. There
is absolutely no excuse for contin
uing the low average yields of
corn made iu the South. Pro
gressive Farmer.
It is not the advocates of peace
only who object to "prepared
ness," says an exchange. The
word itself is in formed an& ille
gitimate, out of keeping with the
genius of English speech: a mon
grel, having the English setter's
bashy tail on the body of an
Italian greyhound. But it is a
mistake to try to use "prepara
tion" in its place, for that means
something different and more
definite. "Keadiness" is the
term.
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., is a
Republican, but says: "I think
President Wilson is doing the
best that any man can do in such
circumstances as have surrounded
his administration. It is the duty
of every American citizen to sup
port him." That is true, and it
is good sense, and not one of the
Republican leadeu ventures to
say what the President ought to
have done. Philadelphia Record

Why Roosevelt Faints Wilson
Black
In making his inevitable re
turn to the Republican party at
this time without loss of dignity,
it was necessary for Mr. Roose
velt to paint President Wilson in
black colors and to picture his re
election as a very terrible ca
lamity to the country. Perhapa
he does not paint Mr. Wilson's
administration blackly enough In
order to justify his abandonment
of the Progressive party. So
far as the attack goes it is con
fined to questions raised by the
war, yet the Progressive party
was seen by Mr. Roosevelt to
be hopeles? as a winning com
bination in the near future be
fore these war issues of his crea
tion had been heard of. In the
autumn of 1914. Mr. Roosevelt
campaigned for Mr. Davenport,
the Progressive candidate for
governor of New York, with the
result that Mr. Davenport was
severely beaten not only by Mr.
Whitman, but even by the im
peached and discredited Sulzer.
That incident proved to Mr.
Roosevelt that the Progressive
party, even under his personal
leadership, was doomed to die.
If the war had not lasted more
than three montns, or if it had
not come at all, Mr. Roosevelt
would still have been under the
necessity of finding his way back
to the Republican party.
What reasons, in that case,
would he have found for think
ing the present administration
the worst since the days of
democracy? Instead of Ameri
canism and preparedness and
the national honor being at
stake, we snould have been told
that something else equally
nerve-racking had happened to
make Mr. Wilfor the worst since
Buchanan. Mr.' v7ilsun was
fated, in Mr. Roosevelt's eyes,
to be the worst since Buchanan
if for no other reason than that
he had to be in order to make
Mr. Roosevelt's support of the
Republican candidate in 1916 a
pure act of the highest-minded
patriotism. Under the circum
stances, Mr. Wilson should be
thankful that he gets off so
lightly with punishment; he
might have been yoked up with
Benedict Arnold or Aaron Burr
instead of Buchanan. Spring

Giving France Her Due
Xo greater tribute has been paid
to Fsance than the recent desig
nation of that country by the
Berlin Tageblatt as "the dominat
ing power of the entente, the
head and soul of the resistance."
Germany began by despising
France. The battle of the Mai ne
shocked the invader into sudden
respect. That respect has been
steadily increasing ever since,
and has reached its culmination
as a result of the heroic four
months' defense of Verdun.
Through these weary, tragic two
years of struggle France has stood
like a rock, giving blow for blow,
and equaling the Prussians them
selves in the supposedly exclusive
Prussian qualities of steady en
durance and military industrial
efficiency.
As a spiritual force there can
be little question that France has
beeu the inspiration of the Allies
and the admiration of the world.
But for all that, it isn't necessary
to ignore the contributions of the
other big members of the entente.
Each of the three ha9 played its
part. If Frauce has provided the
inspiration for their resistance
against Germany and Austria,
Englaud has provided the money
and Russia the men. And it is
this matchless combination of
French courage, British credit
and Russian "cannon fodder"
that is making wreckage of Ger
many'sjhopes. Jackson News.
Kansas has a law that permits a
farmer to give a name to his farm,
register the name and enjoy the ex
clusive right to use it. The farmers
are availing themselves of the privi
lege, for they are beginning to see
that a name steadily associated with
good products is as much an asset es a
trade-mark is.

The Boll Weevil Problem
The thing that confronts us most is hovr to
grow cotton with the Boll Weevil.
The Robinson Chain Drag will do the work, to
brush to the ground the weevil and the punctured
squares, and its use in connection with rapid culti

No Trouble to Maintain
The device is durable and simple and can be
handled by any one able to plow. It creates no ef
