ALLIES MAKING GAINS
Paris, July 4.-The French offen
'sive south of the Comme, in conjunc
tion with the British drive, continued
with complete success, the war office
announced.
The French have occupied two lines
of trenches of the second German po
sition on a front of five kilometers
(three miles), and have captured the
village of Herbecourt.
East of the Meuse, on the Verdun
front, the Germans captured Damloup
redoubt, but the French soon after
ward regained possession of it.
The reserves, which the Germans
rushed up to the Sotume region to
check the Franco-British offensive, be
gan to make themselves felt. a-cord
ing to latest reports received here.
The fighting reached a. pitch of ex
ceptional desperation, but neverthe
less the German efforts to check the
allied advance failed.
The Franco-British allies, thise re
ports say, retain the initiative unim
paired and as the result of the day's
fighting have materially advanced
their line and strengthened their hold
on what they had previously won.
The capture of Curlu, especially in
view of the rapid program made south
of the Somme, represents a great step
forward, for the village bars the road
leading to the only points where the
river can be passed.
The French troops have now before
them on the road to Perrone, their
goal, a series of hummocks, each of
which is crowned by a village, ending
in a narrow plateau.
The British on their part have made
steady progress towards Bapaume,
which is an important center on ac
count of the intersec on there of the
main highways which apparently are
their objects.
LONDON PRESS SANE
IN VICTORY'S HOUR
London, July 4.-The London papers
in their editorials deal with the sit
uation on the British front in some
what reserved fashion, some of them
pointing out that it is not yet known
whether this is really the long await
ed "push" or only another feint in
greater force than any of the previous
movements.
The Graphic remarks: "Our bom
bardment still is being maintained
along the whole front and the enemy
does not know whether we may not
at any moment rush another stretch
of line."
The Express says: "The war has
entered a fresh and prol:ably the last
phase. Our hopes may well he high
but our patience must continue."
ORDERED TO HOLD
ALL THEIR TRENCHES
London, July 4.-A dispatch to the
Daily Mail from headquarters in
France, describing the fighting of the
last two days, says that a close, bit
ter and intensive struggle was engag
ed in over every furlong of the front,
which hal been fortified, continuously,
for seventeen months by every me
<hank al device known to modern war
fare.
'The highest tribute to the success
of the onrush," says this account,
'was the undoubted fact that the Ger
mans were in no degree taken by sur
prise.
"According to prisoners, the bulk of
the enemy's reserves were brought up
to the support and reserve trenches,
and the men in the trenches every
where were ordered to hold out to the
death."

ARRESTED FOR KILLING
A TWO YEAR OLD STEER
Deputy Sheriff Wm. Engle and W.
G. Brown, government farmer, ar
rested Antoine Finley and an Indian
named Fatty Eneas last Sunday even
ing, charged with killing a two year old
steer belonging to the Sisters at St.
Ignatius. They were taken before U.
S. Commissioner John N. Bailey Mon
day and both plead guilty to the com
plaint and waived examination. They
were taken to Missoula Monday and
are now in jail awaiting the action of
the federal grand jury.
The officers learned of the killing and
visited the scene of where it was re
ported to have taken place and some
good detective work was done by them
in uncovering the evidence. The hide,
head and feet had been thrown into a
pot hole and Deputy Sheriff Engle
waded around in the water at times up
to his chin before he recovered the
hide. After securing this evidence the
home of Finley was visited, where
much of the meat was found, and up
on being pressed for an explanation
the suspected men acknowledged their
guilt.
WORLD'S RICHEST
WOMAN IS DEAD
New York, Juyl 4.-Mrs. Hotty
Green, known as the world's wealthiest
wopan, who was eighty years old,
died here. She had suffered three
strokes of paralysis during the past
two months and for several weeks had
been practically helpless.
Her death occurred at the home of
her son, Colonel Edward H. R. Green,
at 5 West Ninetieth street, adjoining
the plain brick four-story house at No.
7 on the corner of Central Park west,
whie-e Mrs. Green had lived lately in
seclusion, except for her son and sev
eral Japanese servants and trained
nurses.
For several weeks past Mirs. Green
had been unable to walk and had
spent practically all of4her time in a
wheel chair. The nurses occasional
ly lifted her into her automobile,
where propped up by pillows and pro
tected by furs, the mistress of finance
enjoyed a few afternoons In the park.
Most of the time she sat in the
wheel chair at one of the front win
dows on the parlor floor of her house
and gazed out over the park, motion
less for hours at a time.
Hetty Green was the world's most
remarkable mistress of finance. The
fortune she has left Is close to $100,
000,000. The righest woman in Amer
iea, she lived almost as frugally as a
shop girl. 11er home was wherever
she chose for a time to hang her lit
tle black cape and bonnet, often in
the hall bedroom of some cheap board
ing house, or in some remote and
modest flat around New York.
Her eccentric extremes of economy
led to a popular misconception of her
as a "self-made woman." As a mat
ter of fact, she was lorn rich. In
1863 she inherited $10,000,000. She
also inherited family traditions which
had been a pride for three centuries,
and which she was anxious to perpet
uate in her children.
She was born at New Bedford,
Mass., in November. 1834, about the
20th, according to her testimony at
one time in court. She was a descend
ant on her mother's side of Henry
land, brother of i'.lgrim John How
land of the Mayflower.
RONAN LOSES
TO WOOD TICKS

defeat before the Stevensville. cham
pions on the University field on the
Fourth. The game was not even a
close one, Stevensville having a strong
team which has played together and
are all seasoned players. Ronan to the
contrary, being forced to play three
men who had never before played with
the others and they did not have the
team work that their opponents pos
sessed.
The game started with Ronan at bat
and McDonald up, who hit one out to
Engstrom who fielded him out at first
White out Dowling to Sanderson; Wood
out Engstrom to Sanderson.
For Stevensville, Ricketts fanned;
Byers walked, was forced at second

scoring Plummer; Oliva made a hit I
scoring Sanderson; Bean got a hit scor
ing Oliva and later scored on Stopher's
error; Dowling out Stopher to McDon
aid. Four runs.

very close to them for fear of tick
fever.) Buell out Ricketts to Sander
son; Jacobs out on a long fly to Watts.
Watts out on a long fly to B. Hull;
Engstrom out Hull to McDonald; Hull
having taken Woods place in the box,
the latter going on third in place of

to McDonald. No runs.
Stopher out on fly to Byers; Ber
gevin hit a safe one but was caught off
the base and was out Plummer to San

game.
White out on a fly to Watts; Wood
struck out; Turnquist out on fly to
Ricketts.
Final score Stevensville 10; Ronan 1.
While there is generally an alibi of
fered for every defeat, it can be said
that the boys got none of the breaks in
the game, everything going against
them. They were outplayed in most:
every position and except for the
strike-out record it would look like a
bad defeat. P. Hull struck out six.
Wood one; while Engstrom had only
two to his credit. The Ronan boys hit I
the ball but it did not go outside the
diamond except in a few instances,
but only one struck out.
They are anxious to try conclusions
with the same team again and they
hope to reverse the score.

RUSSIAN LINES ARE
RESISTING DRIVE
London, July 4.-As the result of
one week of most costly onslaughts on
the Russian lines between the Stok
hod and the Styr rivers the Austro
German forces have advanced their
battle front at the most five miles
eastward towards the Styr, and that
only in some sectors, says a Reuters
dispatch from Petrograd.
Military authorities, the corre
spondent adds, are confident the Rus
sians are firmly holding the enemy
on this front, pending the develop
ment of General Letchitzsky's sweep
through Bukowina, notwithstanding
that strong German reinforcements
are entering the field.
Meanwhile the Russians have pro
gressed fifteen miles southwestward
of Kolomen and the Austrians there
are hard pressed to cover their re
treat to the Carpathian mountains.
British Advance Continues.

July 4.-A further advance has ben
ilade by the iBritish forces east of the
Ancre river, North of the town oi
Ariconre, the British pushed forward
and gained ground at a higher eleva
tion.
FLATHEAD PEOPLE
ATTENDSTAMPEDE
Ronan and the surrounding country
celebrated in Missolua rather extens
ively this year. The town was about
deserted Tuesday, as most everyone
who went to Missoula had left the day
before or very early that morning.
Many more would have made the trip
but for the statements that the roads
were almost impassable and the indi
cations here seemed to bear out the
story. The rain all day Sunday and up
to noon Monday had made a sea of mud
around town and only a few braved the
elements to venture away in their autos
Monday afternoon. Each mile on the
road, however, proved better roads and
by the time Post creek was reached the
roads were fairly good., and from the
they were fine. From there on in ex
cept just above Arlee no better roads
could have been wished for. Had these
facts been known all those in Ronan
with machines would undoubtedly have
gone to the Stampede. Early Tuesday
morning the base ball boys and sev
eral more loads of people started and
arrived in good time to see the Wood
Ticks clean us up.
The Stampede attracted most every
body in the afternoon and the events'
on the program were very good. The
riding, roping, bull-dogging and races
were exciting and everybody seemed to
be getting their money's worth. All
the seats in the grand stand were sold
out before noon and the bleachers were
crowded full and many stood around
the fences enclosing the track. There
was the greatest assemblage of auto
mobiles in the space reserved for park
ing purposes than was ever seen in
Western Montana. Taken all in all,
everybody enjoyed the trip and aside
from it taking so much money out of
the community which should have been
retained at home, the Stampede was a
success.
It would be impossible to mention all
those who were seen in Missoula from
this section without omitting somebody,
so the effort will not le made.

RAIN SPOILS THE RONAN
ST. IGNATIUS BALL GAME
What promised to be the best game
of the season was spoiled by the rain
last Sunday. The Mission Reds came
up primed to get revenge for the beat
ing they received the Sunday before at
St. Ignatius and it looked like they
were in for a better trimming again
but the rain saved them and robbed
Ronan of a victory.
The game started out with Wood
and Turnquist as the battery for Ronan
and Peon and Thill for the Reds. Wood
is a new man secured during the past
week and from the manner in which
he practiced before the game and dur
ing the three innings he pitched Sun
day, he gives promise of being the
best the All Stars have had for some
time. He is a fast man and even if he
does hail from Poison, can play good
ball. Stopher is another promising
player secured at Poison and some of
us are thanking good fortune that Pol
son did not organize this year, With
such material along with what they
have always had their team would have
been hard to beat.
After the Reds had been to bat three
times and Ronan twice last Sunday it
began to rain and the game was off.
It was simply one, two, three and out
for St. Ignatius, while Ronan made
two scores each inning, the score
standing 4 to 0 when the game was
called.
The Reds connected with several of
Wood's delivery but the fielders were
on their toes and gathered in every
thing coming their way. In one inning
Wood pitched just four balls, retiring
the side.
The Reds had some new men in uni
form also and they might have struck
a different stride had the game pro
gressed.
WILL NOT CROWD
NATIONAL GUARD
n San Antonio, Tex., July 4.-Under
orders from department headquarters
commanding officers of national
guardsmen already at border stations
began whipping their men into shape
k for hard service.
Although eager to convert the
r guardsmen into seasoned troops as
quickly as possible regular army oft
cers, realizing the danger of over
working the men in the bazing heat,
will not insist on crowding them.
Almost all the men who have been
brought to the frontier are in excel
lent physical shape, but a great ma
- jority of them are unaccustomed to
s the climate.
Not all the citizen soldiers have been
j inoculated against typhoid. The medi
cal department has been instructed to
see that all are given he typhoir serum
without delay.
ARMY PLANS ARE CHANGED
- Three Departments Created in the
Border Zone.
Washington, July 4.-With more
than 150,000 troops assembling along
the Mexican border, the war depart
ment took steps to decentralize direct
administration of the 1,800-mile fron
tier in the interest of efficiency, and
probably to pave the way for the ap
p pointment of a supreme commander to
co-ordinate all military activities on
the international line.
The border, formerly in the South
- ern department from the Gulf of Mex
ico to California, now is divided into
three military departments, command
s ed by Major General Frederick Fun
ston, Brigade General John J. Per
shing, and Major General J. Franklin
Bell.
War department officials said the
new order, which automatically re
t lieves General Funston of supreme
y command on the border and the enor
mous responsibilities that have crowd
ed upon him, had no signiflcancek as
Indicating preparation for war.
f
READY FOR ACTIVE SERVICE
Thirty Thousand Militiamen Will Soon
Be on Border.
Washington, July 4.-At least 30,000
national guardsmen probably will be
on duty at the Mexican border within
the next two or three days.
No. official information of the num
- her either at border points or on the
Hay is available, but there is reason
to believe this figure is not too high.
Soon after arrival each regiment of
infantry or cavalry will be furnished
with automatic machine guns, 250 of a
new type ordered recently for imme
diate dMivery.
As an experiment the guns will be.
carried in automobiles instead of on
the backs of pack mules and five
cihauffeurrs will be required in each
regiment to operate the cars.
SHUN LIQUOR OR RESIGN
Missouri General So Requests His
Personal Staff.
Nevada, Mo., July 4.-Members of
the personal staff of Brigadier General
Harvey C. Clark, commanding officer
of the Missouri national guard, have
been requested by their superior to
abstain from the use of alcoholic llq1
uors while on present service.
This was disclosed by General Clark
in a speeclh thanking citizens of Ne
viia for the gift of a handsome horse.
The commander added that any memn
hir of his staff who felt he could not
conscientiously comply with the re
dulst had btoin asked to resign.
HAS NO NATIONAL GUARD
Volunteer Organizations Are Forming
in Arizona.
Oatman, Ariz., July 4.-Throughout
this district volunteers are being as.
sembled for military duty in the event
of war with Mexico. Arizona has no
regular national guard and the men
are being trained to take the places
of the militiamen.
Members of a cpmoany organised
here last week by Captain J. B. Deg.
man, have sworn to respond promptly
to a call for volunteers.
Guards Wander Aeross Line.
Nogales, Ariz., July 4.-A corporal
of the national guard who had unwit
tingly crossed the border into Mexico
and had gone more than a block into
Mexican Sonora was escorted back
to the border by a Mexican sentry.
Mailitary authorities have 'experienced
difficulty since the arrival of the
guards in making them understand
that only a street marks the border
line batween the two countries here
and keeping them from crossing the
border line.
