addition to the wanton waste of pub

The Tulsa county courthouse Is
Democratic campaign headquarters.
Stationery, stamps, clerical help and
everything is being thrown into the

in the building Is a candidate for
something or ether.

The ordinary citizen who gees there

The county attorney's offico is ab

the county attorney and his assist

Is Preparing Arraignment
With Care He Equipped
Self for Inquiry.
CONSIDERS HE IS
A LAWYER AGAIN
Preparedness Will he Im
portant Feature of
His Speech.
Spwjal to The World.
B UI I)GE HAMPTON, N. Y July 6.
Charles K. Hughes is preparing
his arraignment of the Wilson admin
istration with the same studious thor.
oughness anil zeal with which he
equipped himself in 1905 for the life
insurance investigation.
Here in the restful quiet of an an
cient lyong Island village he is study
ing national problems, sorting, clari
fying und assimilating In his analyti
cal mind vast stores of statistical data
and documentary evidence Injuring di
rectly upon those issues which he ex
pects to force to the front later as
the very crux of the coming cam
paign. Day by day here in his stud under
the Tremeddcn trees ho is practicing
political preiiredness.
Ho Is so hii limiting his mind with
every material fact hearing upon na
tional problems that it must needs be
an adroit Interlocutor who can catch
him napping when any pertinent
query may be hurled at him later as
he faces the country's voters.
To callers with whom Hughes
talked this afternoon he explained
that he is now devoting his time to
this fundamental task of preparing
rather than to tho mere formulating
of his sieech nf acceptance.
To clothe one's thoughts in clear
and convincing language h holds, is
a comparatively simple matter, once
the mind has grasped accurate con
clusions and fortified those conclu
sions with Incontrovertible facts.
The work upon which he is now
engaged will ha crystallized doubtless
not only in the speech of acceptance,
but also in a scoro of others which
he will deliver, once the active cam
paign Is launched.
Hughes Again the Tawyr.
Hughes considers himself again In
the role of a lawyer, who has been
retained in the most important case
which he has been called upon to
handle in his entire career. He rep
resents the Republican party In an
action In which Woodrow Wiison and
the Democratic party are codefend
ants. Tho American people constitute the
tury, which ultimately Is to pass
upon the merits of tho case.
P.ecnuse of the poor light there h
has abandoned a small room in the
front of his summer home, which
hitherto had been used as a den, aim
has formed a study by screening oft
one end of the music room, whhrh
extends the entire length, east to
west, of Tremeddcn.
His desk is piled high with hooks;
official reports and collections of data
which havo even the remotest bearing
on questions which he will bo called
upon to discuss when ho goes upon,
the stump.
Will He Thoroinihly IVi-parol.
It Is safe to say that no candidate
for the presidency ever went before
the electorate better prepared to pre
sent the questions at issue or better
fortified to resist any onslaught than
the Republican nominee will be by
the time the campaign opens.
It is certain that preparedness will
have an important Place in the speech
of acceptance. Friends of Hughes
know that he feels deeply about th
slate of unpreparcdncss In which th
most recent Mexican crisis found the
nation, and that he will make his po
sition clear in his reply to the address
of notification.
With the data and tho documents
on his desk are piles of notes Hughes
has penciled from time to time when
considering material for his campaign
speeches.
Unlike Tersident Wilson he does not
use a typewriter, and, though he
studied stenography In his law school
days, he used it so little subsequently
that he has forgotten most of the
shorthand characters. Consequent
the notes are all in longhand.
Hughes expects to pass a quiet day
tomorrow, but In the evening he will
drive with his family to the Uridge
hampton Golf club, which is only a
few hundred yards from Tremeddcn,
to watch the fireworks display. Ho
dues not expect to make a speech.

No direct messages had heen re

which reached hurricane proportions
at those points.
Shortly after noon a wireless mes

is the best that we have ever had,
tho food is good and substantial, and
every officer and every private Is
right up on his tiptoes working hard
to make the regiment better. We
have a wonderfully fine force of fiirht-

the morale and the personnel of the
regiment. We go Into the south to do
our duty, whatever that duty Is, and
I know that Oklahoma will not be
ashamed of her soldiers when we come
home. We are anxious to get away,

Wonderful l-ifc.
There is a wonderful system in mil
itary life. The profit that has come
to the soldiers from Simnlsh-Amer-ican
war experience has been wonder
ful. There can be no stricter sani
tary regulations than In an American
military camp. The latrines are at
the ends of the company streets, away
twicX In the rear. Thev are models
of cleanliness and Miuitatioii. 1 he
rules are the strictest. Then, adjoin
ing the latrines, are the company
shower baths. The men have not only
every opportunity, but every encour
agement to be clean. The officers
atnne and bath rooms ale In the
.Id fort building, over the hill from
amp. Every officer in camp marches
ver the lull with towels in hand anil
finds a lot of comfort in it. When
it cotues to violations of the latrine
rule everv officer Is a martinet. The
health of every soldier is regarded
as something to be sacredly guarded,
and the one who violates a I ule that
might menace in physical welfare of
an soldier Is brought to a quick and
positive accounting, fine former sol
dier told me of having once thought
lessly violated the rule, with another
soldier, and they were required to dij;
a new latrine. He thought the offi
cer was right in his punishment.
Manned for Duty.

CARRIZAL HEROES
El Paso Mourns as Nine
Victims of Mexican
Rullets Arrive.
CAPTAIN BOYD IS ONE

Time, Then Inter in
Cemetery There.
E
L PASO, Texas, July 6. El Paso
today paid a silent, solemn trib
ute to the nine American soldiers who
gave their lives for their country at
Currlzal.
Exhumed from a single gravo In an
irrigation ditch on the hultlu field
into which they had been thrown, the
bodies of the soldiers weree brought
to the border by a party of American
undertakers. Only a small crowd was
at the American station to meet the
train, which arrived earlier than ex
pected.
From the time the death train
crossed the Rio Grande the spirit of
mourning seemed to pervade the air.
Motorists muffled their engines as If
to respect the dead. Even the Mexi
can hawkers seemed to catch the air
of quiet respect and were less raucous
than usual as they made their way
through the crowds selling a blacked
draped national shield to be worn on
the coat lapel.
General Hell Along.
General Hell, his staff, the 23 sur
vivors of Carrlzal recently released at
Chihuahua City, and two squadrons of
the Eighth cavalry, wer eln the fu
neral cortege. A brief service was read
at the chapel of the undertaking
rooms by Chaplain W. W. Rrunder of
the Eighth cavulry.
General Hell announced tonight that
efforts to identify any of the bodies
other than those of I apt Charles T.
Royd, Iseut. Henry Adair and Private
Decwitt Rucker had been unsuccess
ful. He said, however, that he hoped
identification may yet be made. Oth
erwisc they will be burled in Arlington
national cemetery. The Identified
bodies are being held to await the dis-
poaiUon nf relatives.

TO ERECT STATION
Unofficial Reports Declare
Structure Will he Host
of Kind in Country.
A FOUR-STORY depot and ad
ministration building will be
erected by the Sand Sprinira Railway
company at the corner of Main
and Archer streets within the near
future, according to unofficial infor
mation which is considered authentic
here. Although no confiramtlon has
been made it Is said that the officials
of the road intend to erect the finest
interurban station in the southwest.
The building will be upon the pres
ent site of the downtown station. The
substantial structure which now serve3
the purpose of depot and office build
ing will be torn down to make way
for the edifice. The building to be
demolished is a two-story affair and
in good condition.
The proposed depot, however, will
be constructed especially to meet tho
demand of the Interurban business.
The entire lower floor will be appro
priated for waiting sooms. Entrance
will be made from both Main ana
Archer streetf.
The three upper floors will be usem
for the general offices of the rail
road. It Is possible that the Sand
Springs Electric company also will
occupy part of tho building. This
company furnishes electricity which
propels the interurban cars.
The depot will be of the best con
struction und will be an asset to
North Main street. The fact that a
substantial structure Is to be demol
ished to make way for the new one
is proof that an unusual depot is
planned.
