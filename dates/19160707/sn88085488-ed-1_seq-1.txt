/..antes S. Adams Killed in Automobile
V lecident West of Colfax Friday
Evening— Was Early Advo
cate of Better Farming
In the tragic death of .lames S.
Adams, who was killed Friday even-1
ing in an automobile accident near |
Lee Siding, west of Colfax, Whit
man county lost a respected pioneer
as well as one of its most scientific,
business-like farmers. In all prob
ability the true facts concerning ihe
death of Mr. Adams will never be
known, as there were no eye wit
nesses to the accident which cost him
his life, and all conclusions are has
entirely on circumstantial evidence. 1
His lifeless body was found about
8:30 Friday morning, under his Ford
automobile, which bad swerved from
the main road and turned turtle.
The discovery was made by Piatt and
Jess Huntley, who promptly sum
moned physicians, although there
was no trace of life. The physicians
pronounced the neck broken, and in
all probability death was instantan
eous. The head was also badly
crushed.
The tracks of the automobile indi
cated that the car had swerved
sharply, leaving the road, and a flat
front tire gave rise to the assumption I
that a blowout had caused the acci
dent. .Mr. Adams was returning
from Endicott, where he had gone !
that afternoon, to Colfax, and the
body was taken to Colfax Friday
night.
Funeral services were held Mon-
day afternoon at Colfax, from the
Plymouth Congregational church,
with Rev. 11. I. Williams of Spokane!
officiating. Burial was at the One- j
cho cemetery. The pallbearers were
John O'Neal, David Beaslew, ('has. L." j
Chamberlin. Chas. Losey, K. M.
W'oodin and II W. Goff, all old time j
friends of Mr. Adams. The funeral
was attended by hundreds of sorrow-!
ing friends of the family, many of
whom accompanied the body to the
burial grounds. Many beautiful floral
offerings covered the casket.
James S. Adams, who was 5.. years
of age at the time of his death, was
a son of William A. and Eliza Adams, I
who crossed the plains by ox team
from Missouri to Eldorado county,!
California, in 1854. In the latter
state the parents engaged in the
dairy business, and it was here that
the Pullman man was born. In 1869
he removed with the family to Doug
las county, Oregon, and came to
Whitman county as a young man in!
188°- locating a homestead of 160
acres just north of the Hose Creek I
school house, four miles north of j
Pullman, which he owned at the time j
of his death.
Mr. Adams farmed the homestead |

three proposed districts to weather
the storm of protest, includes eight
blocks, from the 0.-W. K. & N.

paving of this stretch will provide
Continuous) paving on State street!
from one end of town to the other, |
with the single exception of the hill

the Church street district, which was
defeated, and may be made a Sep
arate district later to complete the
State street paving.

of Wednesday evening was an ad
journed session from the evening
previous, it was impossible to con
sider an ordinance confirming the
preliminary resolution concerning
this district, but the ordinance will
be considered at the next regular
meeting, after which bids tor the
work will be called.
