WASHINGTON, July 6. The
war department announced to-
night that it soon would tall out
the regular army reserve to till
up the ranks of the new organ iza-
tions of regulars provided for by

Naturally Accounted For

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WAUKEGAX. III., July 6. William
H. Orpet. the college student charged
with the murder of Marion Lambert,
left Judge Donnelly's court room hap
py tonight. In the belief that the un
qualified statements of chemists on
the witness stand today had demol
ished the case of the prosecution. His
counsel, James H. Wi'.kerson, Ralph
F. Potter and Leslie H. Hanna, also
were jubilant.
Testimony Reverted.
The hardest blow to the prosecution
came from Dr. W. J. McNally, who
as a witness reversed the testimony
which he gave three weeks aso for
the ste.te. The state had relied upon
his testimony and that of Dr. Ralph
Webster, both chemists, to convince
the jury that Marion died of cyanide
of potassium in solution. Both testi
fied to this as a fact, but today Dr.
McNally having conducted further ex
periments, swore positively that his
first testimony was erroneous and that
powdered poison caused her death.
Girl Was Hysterical.
Another important witness was Dr.
W. O. Krohn. an alienist, who testi
fied that Marion was of a hysterical
type with a tendency toward suicide,
and that Orpet's "brain roB." upon
suddenly finding Marion dead, was to
be expected In a young man of his
temperament. Other witnesses were
Dr. J. A. Wesener. Dr. U I. Shaw, IV.
Carl Minor and Dr. John H. Iing. all
expert chemists and toxlcologists. and
Robert A. Henvener, a wholesale drug

welcomed General Carranza's pro

Financial Aid for Mexico.
While the immediate purpose of tlie
negotiation in which Secretary Lan
sing's note is to be the first step, will
be the evolutOn of some plan for
tranquilizing the border region, the
discussions may take on a wide scope.
There is little doubt that Mr.
Arredondo received the impres

' day that if adequate guarantees
as to the security of American
and other foreign interests in
Mexico could be secured, the
Washington government believe
it possible that financial aid. so
