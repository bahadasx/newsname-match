Friday isued a meniorndum in re
ply lo Secretary Ijinslng's recent
note In which the correctness of as

tain its armed forces oil Mexican
soil. The memorandum contains thir
ty five count. Although not in the
form of a direct reply to the Wash
ington note It is considered equiva
lent to an unswer to that document.
It expresses surprise that the Wash
ington government should have been
pained at the tone and the contents
of the Car ran .a document, since it
maintains that the I'nited States h
sent lo the constitutional government
not only one hut many disoourteou
and even overbearing notes.
The note sii: "The constitution
alist government can tolerate In no
manner the continued presence on
Mexican territory of American troops,
who have no excuse for being there."
Emphatically reiterating t'.ie Mexi-
an governments po-ition oer.ynm
the right of the I'nited states lo
eep armed Isidies in Mexico, tho
memorandum denies energetically
that the Mexican government has
roterted bandit who had committed
epredalions in the I'nited States and
efies Washington lo produce proof
of the assertion.
