THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THRONG
ED CITY THE FOURTH—FINE
PROGRAM CARRIED OUT
One of the biggest celebrations at
tempted in this part of the state was
pulled off in Little Falls the Fourth
of July, in commemoration of the Na
tional Independence Day. Thousands
of people from every neighboring'city,
town and village were here to take
part in the celebration and all were
highly pleased with the program ar
ranged for their entertainment. The
business men also stated that the cele
bration was of the worth while kind.
First, in the morning, a patriotic
program was held at the high school
auditorium, beginning at 10 o'clock.
The attendance was not what it should
have been. The program opened with
with a selection by the band, and a
song by a quartette composed of Ches
ter Tanner, Harry Dobbyn, Ovid Be
langer and Petrus Liljedahl. Miss
Genevieve Ragan read the declaration
of Independence and Miss Marie Gan
non gave a vocal solo.
Hon. C. M. Andrist, secretary to
Governor Burnquist, gave the Inde
pendence Day address. Mr. Andrist
is a very forceful speaker and his au
dience was attentive and appreciative.
He stated that in his opinion no chap
ter is more interesting, no story more
practical, than the story of the settle
ment of colonies which gave rise to
what is now the United States of Am
erica, therefore he chose to talk on
this subject.
For ages, the speaker said, this con
tinent of America, remained vacant,
containing only a small population of
aborigines, who were always at war
and killing off each other. He said
that he believed that it was the plan
of God that on this continent the last
spirit of popular government should
be tried out, that this continent was
preserved by God Almighty for this
purpose. He asked the people to stop
and consider how the various colonies
were formed by people of different
races and riligious sects. In 1807 the
first colony was founded. Out of 105
men in this colony most of them were
aristocrats, there being only four car
penters, six or eight masons, and a
dozen town laborers. This percentage
has continued alike ever since until
now we find that the people ia the
south are more aristocratic than those
in the north. The reason the south
erners are more aristrocratic is that
other colonies were formed farther
south by aristrocrats from this first
colony who could not tolerate living
with the democratic class. Later an
other colony was formed by people
who sought religious liberty and out
of this colony grew another, because of
the ideas of certain persOris^ecoming
intolerable. And so on, for years and
years, the colonization continued, un
til at the time of the Revolution, there
were thirteen independent colonies, all
of which joined together to maintain
their rights against the tyrant. They
prepared a document, the Declaration
of Independence, which was the great
est paper of its kind up to that time.
Mr.' Andrist stated that he liked the
way that the document started out,
namely: ''Wihen, in the course of
human events, it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume among the
powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station in which the Laws of
Nature and of Nature's God entitle
them, a decent respect to the opinions
of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them
to the separation." Another thing
that makes this document of interest
is the statement that "We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal." The speaker said
that some men do not believe that ill
men are created equal and he added
that he did not believe that they are
in the sense of that all are not favored
with the same endowments. But in
the sense of equal rights and that pur
suit of happiness all are created equal,
he believed.
Mr. Andrist mentioned the slavery
question, which was the dominant
question, in the middle of the nine
teenth century and which, he said,
cursed this nation for many a year
and nearly resulted in its destruction.
Splendid tributes were Tiaid to Min
nesota and its men bv the speaker
when he said that at the outbreak of
the Civil War a Minnesotan was the
first* man to answer Abraham! Lin
coln's call for volunteers and the
First Minnesota Regiment, in the bat
tle of Gettysburg, lost the greatest
number of men that were ever lost in
any charge from the beginning of
time. Now, with a population of a
hundred million, the country is threat
ened with war. Four thousand sol
diers are camped at Ft. Snelling and
if the worst comes, Minnesota need
have no fear as to the record those
boys will make at the front, he said.
Mr. Andrist told the interesting
fact that neutrality, which the Unit
ed States has striven to maintain dur
ing the present European war, was
unknown before Washington's time
It was brought in by the United States
and because of its policy of neutrality
in the present war the United States
has been made th^e {greatest nation in
the world. The established principle
of this country has become not to
•rush to- war and this' principle1 has per
mitted her to £row. develop and pros
per. She has published to the world
that she has no desire for conquest,
that she respects the rights of nations
great and small.

curring in the eighth inning, one of
them being responsible for the one
score made by the locals.
Gourd, on the mound for Little
Falls,* pitched splendid ball. He held
the visitors to seven hits, which, were
well, ^.scattered. He struck out nine
men and did not administer a single
pass. Victor did good work for Brain
erd, holding the locals to six hits nd
getting four strikeouts. The pitchers
were given excellent support.
The only run registered came in the
eighth inning. Dunphy sent a ground
er to Cook, who fumbled it, and he got
first-safely. Gourd grounded out, Vic
tor to Cook. Longley singled and
Meyers flew out to Pehle. Rossman
sent a grounder down the line along
the third sack, Templeton failing to
