Howcver, dovelopments in tho menn-
while hnd come to the effoct that the
bunch of keys had been found and
turned over to Mr. Lnvnlley, nnd that
the tleeds, photographs, etc, had been
destroyed by fire. It wns claimed by
the Stnte thnt on the morning nftor tho
robbery Garvey started for Vergennes
afoot nnd blew in tho proceeds of the
robbery before he got bnck to Iiridport
a week lnter.
There were a large number of wit-
nesses forjthe twosides and both Gnrvey
and his wife teatified for the defense.
For the respondent there was set up an
alibi, showing that he wna absolutely
somewhere else at the precise time that,
according to Mr. Petors, the robbery
had taken place, with a strong intima
tion that one of the chiof witnesses for
the State was himself, the guilty man.
Judge Miles gnve the cnao to the jury a
little after six o'elock, nppointing Mr,
Russell of Monkton their foreman.
The jury was out on the case all
night and cnme into court at the open
ing Saturday morning, nsking for fur
ther instructions. At 11 o'elock they
came back and the foreman nnnounced
that they had been unable to agree.
The court aent them back to their con-
sultation room and in half an hour they
came in once more, this time to an
nounce that they had found the respond
ent guilty of grand larceny, instead of
burglary in the daytime.
The court retired forcounsel and upon
returning, brief remarks were made for
the State by Mr. Sturtevant and in be
half of the respondent by Mr. LaFleur.
Garvey declined to say anything for
himself when given the chnnce, and
after ndministering to him a atrong
doseofgood advice, Judge Miles sen
tenced him to serve not more than two
yenrs and not leaa than one and one-
half years at hard labor in the State
prison at Windsor.
A criminal case somewhat outside of
thettsual procedure va3 taken up during
tho noon recess on Friday,- the court com
ingin at'l':15o'clockfor thepurpose. The
case was Stwte vs Minnie Boulia, an 18-
year-old Bridport girl who was charged
with having set' fire to a barn owned by
Michael St. Geor'ge in Bridport on Feb
ruary 9, 191G. The proceedings were
merely pro forma, a jury being hast
ily got together without a chnllenge
and Lewis C. Bain of Bristol being made
their foreman. It waa proven that the
respondent had beyond doubt set fire to
the barn, whioh together with its con
tents of $60 or $70 worth of hay, grain
and farming implements, had burned
to the ground. TheState's attomey
