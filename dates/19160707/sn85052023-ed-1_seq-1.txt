TOPPLED OVER
BRIDGE IN AUTO
Teddy Aldridge Badly Injured And
Has Narrow Escape From Be
ing Instantly Killed.
Teddy Aldridge, of this citv, was
the victim of an auto accident at a
ate hour Wednesday night, which al
most cost his life. While being tow
ed into town in his racer roadster by
H. L. Bailey, of the Bailey Garage
Company, the tow rope became en
tangled in steering gear of the dis
abled car coming down Cemetery
hill. Mr. Aldridge lost control of his
machine, which crashed over the
bridge head into the creek below,
completely reversing itself and pin
ning Mr. Aldrich under it. His right
leg was crushed just above the an
kle, both bones being broken, and he
sustained a severe injury to his head
above the left temple, which may
prove the more serious injury of the
two. A large contusion was made,
through which the physicians have
been unable yet to ascertain whether
the skull is fractured or not Mr.
Aldridge did not lose consciousness
at any time, however. He complains
of a feeling of bleeding inside the
skull on the right side and fears are
entertained that a blood vessel within
the head, has been ruptured.
The car which took the almost fa
tal plunge has been an unfortunate
one for its owner, who has had it in
the repair shop for some time. A
few weeks ago, while standing in
front of the garage on Depot street,
it started in some way, and tore
down the hill, barely missing running
over pedestrians as it ran across
Main street at a frightful rate of
speed, as it gained momentum. It is
a built over machine, on the racer
type, and Mr. Aldridge, who is local
agent for a Lebanon wholesale liquor
house, used it considerably in his
i ' business. He started out in it Wed
nesday evening, and was on the
western slope of Cemetery Hill, when
it stalled on him and 'he- telephoned
to Bailey's Garage for a tow in. Mr.
Bailey responded shortly afterward,
and started to town with the disabled
car towing behind, Mr. Aldridge
steering the "dead" car. Coming
down this side of the hill, which is
rather steep, Mr. Aldridge says that
the tow rope became entangled in
some way with his steering gear and
he was unable to control the car,
which took a sudden slant off the
bridge and over it went with its
driver. He was thrown somewhat
away from it in the fall, else he
might have been instantly killed.
The fall must have been 15 or 20
feet. The rope broke as the car
plunged over the bridgehead. Mr.
Bailey quickly stopped his machine
and went to the assistance of the in
jured man. He did not wait for as
sistance. He realized that Mr. Al
dridge was seriously injured, so man
aged to pull him loose from the
wreckage, carried him up the creek
bank, placed him in his car and has
tened to town taking him to his own
apartment in the garage building on
Depot street, and summoned medical
aid.
Col. Nick Wathen, of Lebanon,
who owns the distillery whose pro
duct Mr. Aldridge sells, came up
Thursday in his car to see Mr. Al
dridge, who has long been his per
sonal friend and stands high with his
house.
This morning Mr. Aldridge seems
to be resting as easy as possible un
der the circumstances. Everything
possible is being done to make him
rest easy, but his injuries are natur
ally very painful. It is impossible
so physicians say, yet to ascertain
just what the nature of the injury
to his head may prove to be.
RICHMOND AUTO ACCIDENT
While returning from the Rich
mond Chautauqua Wednesday night,
Robert Covington, son of R. C. H.
Covington, a prominent merchant of
that city, lost control of the auto
mobile he was driving, ran over an
embankment on the railroad bridge
on the new Lexington pike, and de
molished his car. He was accompa
nied by John Edwin Powell, who was
slightly injured.
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Griffith
were drowned in the Ohio River at
Ghent, when their automobile jumped
from a ferryboat after the accelera
tor had been applied instead of the
brake.
Thirty-five boys of the Reform
School at Lexington were paroled
so that they could enlist in the Lex

CARROLL SHANKS TO GET JOB
In State Banking Department Said
to Have Stanley's Promise.
The appointment of Senator Geo.
G. Speer, of Frankfort by Gov. Stan
ley, as State Banking Commissioner
this week, lent hopes to his many
friends here that the appointment of
W. Carroll Shanks, of this city, as
State Bank Examiner, would be an
nounced at the same time. It has been
understood for some time that Mr.
Shanks was 'to receive this plum from
Gov. Stanley, who is his close cousin,
and who is said to have promised
it to him some time ago. However,
Commissioner Speer at once appoint
ed Rankin Revill, Rodes Settle and
J. Stone Walker as Bank Examiners,
so that just what position Mr. Shanks
is to receve is not generally known,
as there have been but three regular
Bank Examiners in the office during
the past term of Banking Commis
sioner Thomas J. Smith, of Rich
mond, who has just retired. Mr.
Shanks, who is one of the most prom
inent and best known farmers of the
county, has been taking a special
course in banking at the Lincoln
County National Bank for several
months, in order to be prepared to
fill the position the governor is said
to have promised him.

GREAT "DRIVE"
STILL GOES ON
English and French Penetrate Second
Line Trenches of Germans
And Still Go Forward
The great offensive or "drive" of
the English and French armies in an
effort to force the Germans out of
France and Belgium, started July 1st
after an intense artillery bombard
ment. So far the allies claim to have
caused the Germans a loss of about
GO, 000 men. The allies have pene
trated at points a distance up to sev
en miles through the German first
and second lines of trenches. The
latest dispatch from London has this
to say of the offensive:
Having captured the whole Ger
man second line south of the Somme
river from the river to BeUoy. the
French have resumed operations to
the north of the river and have clear
ed the bank almost to Clerj. The
French who have established them
selves at Sormont farm also threat
en Clery. The British are still heav
ily engaged all along their front
from Hardecourt. Notwithstanding
heavy German counter-atacks, tl ty
have been able to maintain all che
ground gained and extended it at
some points.
As the German trenches are occu
pied, evidence accumulates of the
deadly execution of artillery. In
some cases 80 per cent of the defend
ers were killed by the terrific shelling
to which they were subjected Brit
ish losses vary. Certain formations
being called on to attack defenses
where machine guns remained un-
uamugi'u, uiieieu Heavily. (.'tncia
captured the positions which they
had been set as their objective with
very slight losses.
Instead of compelling the Germans
to lessen their efforts at Verdun, the
Anglo-French offensive seems to
have increased their determination,
possibly in the hope of preventing the
French from sending reinforcements
to the Somme.
-iBritish observers
tion with .the progress winch has been
made. With the heavy casualties
caused by the bombardment and the
taking of 16,000 prisoners and a
great quantity of war materials, to
gether with the subsequent losses in
flicted in counter-attacks, it is be
lieved that the German power of re
sistance must have been weakened.
The Russians continue to record
successes, some of which are import
ant, along thei,: whole front from
Riga to the Carpathians. The situa
tion in the Caucasus is somewhat
confusing. Turkish and Russian re
ports are more at variance than us
ual, both claiming victories in the
Schoruk region on the Russian right.

CHILD MEETS
HORRIBLE FATE
Asleep in Grass Near Home at Cedar
Creek When Heavily-Laden
' Wagon Runs Over Him.
On Tuesday the five-year-old son
of Mr. Sady Doane was run over and
killed at his home near Cedar Creek,
known as the George Abraham's
farm. It seems that the little fellow
was waiting on the bridge near his
home for the wagons hauling in hay,
and had been swinging on behind
and riding to the barn. He went as
far as the bridge and lay down and
went to sleep in a bunch of weeds
at the edge of the Dridge. His little
cousin, about twelve years of age,
drove up with a wagon load of hay,
and failed to see the little form ly
ing so peacefully asleep. The heavy
wagon passed over the middle of his
of his body and with the cry of
"Mamma," on his lips, his spirit
passed from earth. The stricken
parents have the deepest sympathy
of every one in this sad hour. The
little cousin is heart-broken and re
fuses to be comforted.
BURGLARS AT CRAB ORCHARD.
Several Citizens' Homes Visited By
a Midnight Marauder.
Several Crab Orchard people had
visits from a burglar Wednesday
night and at least two of them feel
the effects of the call. Dr. W. W.
Burgin's home was entered by a win
dow of the dining room and his pants,
which were lying close to the bed,
were relieved of two $5 bills and $3
or $4 in silver. The scamp was clev
er enough to leave his watch. J. H.
Collier, who also lives in the depot
end of the city, was visited and $20
in paper taken from his coat pocket.
Thinking everybody honest, Mr. Col
lier does not lock his doors and the
thief found easy sailing in his prem
ises. His watch, a fine gold one, was
also overlooked. Frank Brooks had a
;callrbutrit.W Victor mtide. .sa muchAmade to ascertain just who perpetrat
noise that he awoke the host, who
scared him away. The same night
footsteps were heard on George Par
rish's porch and when the door was
opened the imposter was heard to
jump from the side of the porch and
take to his heels. So far officers
have been, unable to ascertain who
the rascal is, but every effort will be
brought about in the effort to land
him.
NO MALT MEAD AT C. O.
Soft drink establishments at Crab
Orchard will in the future handle no
more malt mead, or other drinks,
made in imitation of beer, and which
contain a small per cent of alcohol.
This was decided a short time ago
when the licenses of the two soft
drinks stands at Crab Orchard ex
pired, and the owners failed to make
application for renewal of the malt
mead privilege. It is reported that
quite a lengthy petition had been
f igned h the best PeoPle of the caP
ital of the East End, requesting the
City Fathers to refuse to grant such
license, and the proprietors' decided
not to defy public sentiment and did
not ask for renewal of their malt
mead and other such drink licenses.
It is understood that a country store
near Preachersville, has just taken
out the malt mead license, however,
and will sell the stuff. Uncle Sam re
quires a license for the sale of such
drinks as this, also.
BURGLAR ON LOGAN AVENUE.
A burglar, who seemed more hun
gry than anything else, visited the
home of W. S. Embry on Logan ave
nue some time Tuesday night. He
effected entrance through a side win
dow, took a cold cooked chicken, and
other eatables, then rifled Mr. Em
bry's trousers, securing about 30
cents in money and several soda
water chips, but either overlooked or
was afraid to steal Mr. Embry's gold
watch which was in the small watch
pocket of the trousers. The intruder
flung the trousers on a chair and de
parted without waking either Mr.
Embry or his wife, and left no clew
to his identity.
FIRE ON MRS. HUNN'S ROOF.
Sparks from the kitchen chimney
set fire to the shingle roof of Mrs.
Am Hunn's home on Lancaster
street about nine o'clock this morn
ing. The volunteer fire department
responded quickly to the fire bell,
and had the incipient blaze out be
fore the hose was necessary. Full
insurance is carried on the building.

THOMAS H. EADS BUYS FARM.
The real estate firm of Hughes &
McCarty sold this week for Mrs. J.
C. Barker her farm of 500 acres,
situated about 3 1-2 miles from Hus
tonville. The price was private. The
I. J. is told this is a splendid invest
ment and it has no doubt but that Mr.
Eads has bought the right place and
will make good money on it. Mr.
Eads is an all around good farmer
and hustler. We are sorry to lose
him and his family. He says that
he expects to make a stock farm out
of the place.
WOODWARD TO BUILD ROAD.
Woodward Bros., who are building
such a splendid roadway out the
Crab Orchard pike In this county un
der the stateaid contracts, were suc
cessful in securing the contract to
build the Somerset-Eubank road at
the re-letting of the contracts by the
Pulaski fiscal court last week. The
contract the local contractors secured
will amount to about $30,000. Eu
gene Moynahan, also of Jessamine
county, secured a contract to build
about $70,000 worth of road for Pu
laski, in another direction.
TWO NEW SCHOOLHOUSES
The County Board of Education
held a short meeting here Monday,
routine business occupying chiefly the
attention of the members. Two new
schoolhouses have just been complet
ed and have been accepted by the
Board. One is located at Grneu
heim, and wil be taught this coming
term by Miss Mayme Singleton. The
other is on Moccasin, north of King's
Mountain and will be taught by Rus
sell Thompson. Each was erected
at a cost of about $400.
TACKS SCATTERED ON PIKE.
Autoists who went and returned
from Danville Thursday morning,
picked up a lot of tacks in their tires,
which seem to have been strewn by
some miscreant with malice in his
heart toward car drivers. Quite a
number came in with tires down, and
one picked a dozen small carpet tacks
out of one tire. An effort is being
ed such a' deed, and itissaid that a
clew has been obtained to his ident
ity. WAYNESBURG LADY DEAD
The aged mother of J. G. Warri
ner, proprietor of the Warriner Ho
tel, died at his home in the southern
section of the county Thursday. J.
A. Ball, of this city, went there and
embalmed the body which was taken
to her old home in Russell county for
interment. Mrs. Warriner was a
splendid old lady in every way. She
was a life-long Christian and beloved
by all who knew her. She was 82
years of age and is survived by sev
eral sons and daughters.
LIGHTNING STRIKES HOUSE.
During the severe thunder and
lightning storm Monday afternoon,
lightning struck the handsome home
of T. A. Rice on Danville avenue.
Only a small corner of the metal
shingled roof was struck, and the
damage to the building was only
slight. Miss Willie Hocker, of Pine
Bluff, Ark., who is visiting her niece,
Mrs. Rice, was slightly shocked by

CARRANZA BACKS DOWN.
Washington, July 7. Early re
sumption of friendly diplomatic con
versations with the de facto govern
ment of Mexico to the end that peace
and order may be restored in North
ern Mexico and along the border is
expected here to be the next step of
the United States in its deliberations
with its Southern neighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M., and culmi
nating in the fight at Carrizal, Mex.,
between American and Mexican
troops, appeared lhursday to have I
oeen aissipatea oy an amicauie note
from Gen. Carranza, presented dur
ing the day by his Ambassador Desig
nate here, Eliseo Arredondo.
Th note proposes that the differ
ences between the Governments be
setted by mediation or by direct ne
gotiations. It is remarkable for its
brevity, its restrained and friendly
tone and for the absolute lack of any
of the strong, even insolent language
which characterized the last two com
munications from the de facto gov
ernment. It treats as a closed inci
dent the exchange of unfriendly com
munications which brought war al
most within sight.
The de facto Government of Mex
ico was informally informed last
night through Eliseo Arrendondo',
Ambassador designate, that the
United States welcomed Gen. Carran
za's proposal to adjust all pending
differences between the two Govern
ments by direct diplomatic negotiation.
Tuesdays and Fridays
NEW STYLE OF
MULE COLT RING
Stanford Fair Offers $150 for Best
Young Hybrid, Winner to Become
Property of Fair Association
Public spirited business men all
over this and neighboring counties
are contributing liberally to the spe
cial premiums for the Knights of
Pythias Fair to be held in Stanford,
August 23, 24, and 25. A splendid
list has already been secured, which
assures one of the most attractive
premium lists of any fair in a coun
try town in Kentucky this season.
A new and very attractive feature
will be the Mule Colt Stake this sea
son, which will be one of the most
liberal and attractive offered on any
fair circuit this season. The stake
this year will be worth $150, which
will go to the winning colt, but a pro
vision of the stake will be that the
animal which wins the blue and the
money will become property of the
Fair Association. This will be in
effect offering the sum of $150 for
the best mule colt in this section,
which is an offer that no breeder
would probably refuse for the best
young hybrid in his lot. The ring h
an innovation which is bound to at
tract a lot of attention, and will un
doubtedly prove very popular. No
entrance fee will be charged to the
ring.
BUYS MORE LAND IN LINCOLN.
While back home in Kentucky last
week, Col. G. W. Durham of the Un
ion Pacific railroad with headquar
ters in New York, added to his Lin
coln county farm acreage by pur
chasing the farm of Hugh H. Logan.
containing 62 1-2 acres, situated a
mile from Crab Orchard on the Lancaster-Crab
Orchard pike near his
other farm. He gets possession of
the fields, which are fallow now and
of the house, garden, etc., on the
first of January, next. Col. Durham
will endeavor to find a trust-worthy
tenant for the place. That he has
confidence in the future of Lincoln
,c,ounty farm lands is evidenced, by
the fact that he in increasing rather
than decreasing his acreage, although
he has had recent opportunities to
"close out."
WOODS CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.
At a meeting of the Democratic
committee here last Saturday, which
was attended by four of the commit
teemen, James H. Woods, a well
known young democrat, was chosen
campaign chairman to lead the fight
to carry Lincoln county for Wilson
and Marshall in November. As Lin
con is very close under normal condi
tions, he should, and doubtless will,
have the support of every democrat
in seeing that this county stays in
the right column.
CLEMMONS LEFT $800,000.
Commissioners appointed a year
ago to settle the estate of Rankin
Clemmons, millionaire of Fayette
county, filed a report this week, dis
posing of property valued at over
$800,000, according to the settle
