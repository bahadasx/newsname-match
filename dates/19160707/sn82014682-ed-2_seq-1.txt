the big four that attended 'the St.

namely "Link" McCandless, J. H. Wil
son, M. C. Pacheco and Judge T. B
Stuart.
The governor's ears at this writing
should surely burn because there is
much being said about him at this
time. The truth about the matter is
that the governor Is being called
names and the conversation centering
around him is not at all complimen
tary, f
' The quartet Is chasing everyone in
high Democratic official life who will
lend a willing ear to hear the con
plaint against the governor of Hawaii
Senators and congressmen are button

are spreading very softly the infor

decide upon a change the person to
fill the post creditably and with much-
satisfaction to the poor Democrats of
the. territory would be "Link" Mc
Candless.
The last information brought to
headquarters from the firing line was
that the four visitors were hot on the
trail of Secretary of the Interior Lane
to tell hlntjtbeir troubles about Gov

The two big political conventions

who Journeyed here after St Louis,
the result of the Chicago conclave
was the. appearance of Kuhio, the del
egate: Bob Breckons, tne new Re
publican national committeeman, and
the expectation of Henry Lyman
taking a few weeks to look over af
fairs at Washington.
The prince will stay here until the
end" of July. His main concern at pre
sent is to have the house conferees
on the river and harbor ' appropria
tion bill retain the senate amendment
which inaugurates work on the Kahu
lul barbor project Maui. The house
conferees, are on record against any
new projects and for this reason It
means strenuous work to have the
house represen.tatives on the confer

ate amendment Kuhio has enlisted
the aid of his, friends in the house.
