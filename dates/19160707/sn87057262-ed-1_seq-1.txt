SAIN! ANTONIO, Texas, July 7.—
Fbe arrival of additional state troops
and the organization of four new regi
ments of regulars will make Fort
Sam Houston the largest military

000 and 17/000 soldiers here, includ
ing about 11,000 national guardsmen.
The combined strength of the militia

maneuver division of 1911.
The quota of militiamen destined
for this camp will be completed by
the arrival of 1,300 Illinois guardsmen,
expected tomorrow. They will include
a regiment of field artillery, two field
hospitals, a single oorps company and
company of engineers.
The Second Missouri infantry, with

HOW TO BRING
PEACEAND PLENTY
American-Mexican Situation
Today Has Changed
From One Contem
plating War.
MONEY IS NEEDED
Encouragement to Carranza and
Financial Altf Might End
All of the
Trouble.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, July 7.—The Amer
ican-Mexican situation today had
changed from one that contemplated
war to one contemplating rehabilita
tion of Carranza's country. How to
toring peace and prosperity orat of tihe
Mexican chaos iwaa the problem be
fore President Wilson and his cab
inet. The session was expected to
mark the second step by Hie presi
dent in working out his Mexican
•policy.
Primarily the cabinet had tor con
sideration Secretary Lansing^ for
mal reply to Secretary Aguilar's
pacific note. This formally accepts
the idea of direct negotiations, and, it
was understood, indicates the willing
ness of this government to go a long
way in helping restore the shattered
republic.
Other problems of prime import
ance 'before the o&binet were*
First—Wlhait is to toe done about
guarding the border and permitting
Carranza to establish a parallel patrol
in -cantonments on tit»«ide of the
line.
Second—.What to do about
militiamen on the border to their
homes with the Incidental Increase
in the regular army to fill their
places.
Third—And basically most import
ant, what to do to place Mexico on a
firm footing among the nations.
With respect to the latter, the ad
ministration feels that it cannot at
present encourage bankers to extend
aid to Mexico. But It is hopeful Car
ranza can now take a strong .guiding
hand which will ensure a stable gov
ernment ultimately and thus afford
the opportunity for American finan
cial aid.
The Americans remaining in Pled
is Negras feared an attack was pend
ing and crossed to this side of the
lio Grande. General Greene doubled
ae previously heavy night guard. The
ewly arrived Carranza troops were
eported to be unruly and the civil-1 tajnetj upon other than confiscatory
One hundred million dollars, ac
cording to a high government of
ficial, would be the salvation of the
stricken nation if it could be ob-
terms. The great fear is however
that "loan sharks" may demand Mex
ico as their collateral—a proposition
•which carranza would heartily re
Ject and which the administration
will not support.
To encourage Carranza in establish
ing his government and to work out
a scheme of financial assistance
which will not cfxtort Wood money
from Mexico, was the big adminis
tration problem.

CONFIDENCE IN BERLIN

Some
That French Have Made
Gains, But They
Are Not Deemed
tterloua.
[By Carl
w.
Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, July 7.—a Bevere check
haa been administered to the British
army In the combined Anglo-French
offensive, according to reports receiv
ed here today anj the British tyave
suffered unusually heavy losses.
Since tne opening day of the Brit
ish attack, General Haig*s army has
been unable to make any important
gainp against the German line. Forced
to abandon shell-wrecked first line
positions, the Germans retired to
their second line north of the Somme,
where they threw back time and
again, British Infantry assaults.
It is well understood liere that the
British will resume the offensive, per
•hfltpSfc"1frflh greater violence than mark
ed the first day of the forward move
ment, but the manner in which the
German wall withstood the first at
tack has inspired the greatest confi
dence in Berlin. A group of British
prisoners, captured at the village of
Sen*e, admitted their disappointment
at the stubborn nature of the German
defense.
"We thought it would be a romp
across Serre after our guns had fin
ished their work," a captured officer
was quoted as saying. "Instead Ger
mans popped out of all sorts of funny
places and got machine guns working
on us."
That the French have made some
substantial gains south of the Somme
is not denied here. But the French
gains, it is stated, constitute no ser
ious menace to the German line,
which is amply prepared to repel any
serious menace on the sector around
Peronne.
The British Report.
LONDON, July 7.—British troops
have captured a thousand yards of
German trenches in severe fighting
east of LaBotsselle, (east of Albert)
General Haig reported this afternoon.
The gain is one of the most impor
tant advances scored by the British
since the first day of the allies' great
offensive.
Severe fighting Is going on on the
LaBoisselle sector. Hai? reported.

Germans have suff°red heavy
losses.
.."Southwest of Thlepval a deter
mined enemy attack was completely
repulsed," reported the British com
mander in chief.
The British gain east of LaBoiselle
is of particular Importance because it
links up with the eastwarl advance of
the French north of the Somme. The
Germans had massed large forces on
this sector and counter attacked des
perately in efforts to fling back the
British line.
1,000 Yards of Trenches.
[By Ed L. Keen, United Press Staff

LONDON, July 7.—British troops
resumed their great offensive against
the Germans at dawn today, with sim
ultaneous smashes against the Ger
man lines on a wide front.
An official statement from General
Haig, given out at 2:45 this after
noon', announced a striking British
success east of LaBoiselle, where
1,000 yards of German trenches were
taken, and the capture of several im
portant tactical positions.
"This morning we resumed a vig
orous offensive at dawn."* reported
General Haig. "The Germans simul
taneously launched heavy attacks
against our new trenches near the
Ancre brocfc! and north of Fricourt,
resulting in violent fighting between

vicinity of Ovillers and LaBoiselle

PROGRESSIVIES ARE
POPULAR PEOPLE
Republicans and Democrats Speak
Honied Words to Former
Bull Moosera.
NEW YORK, July 7.—Members of
the late lamented progressive party
are finding themselves very much
sought after individuals these days.
It appeared fairly well established to
day that one reason why neither the
democratic nor republican campaign
managers had yet announced the full
membership of the campaign com
mittees, was because they both hoped
to corral a number of progressives
for this work.
It is known there will be at least
six progressives of the committee of
seventeen which will direct Hughes
campaign. Vance MoCormick, demo
cratic national chairman, reiterated
today his declaration that Wilson's
re-election
was assured, because the
progressives were "men of princi
ple." Most of whom could not bring
themselves to go back into the fold
under men they have dubbetKbosses.
One of the stunts which republican
leaders are anxious to put into force
is ocular demonstration of the entente
cordiale which has been restored be
tween the republicans and those who
bolted four years ago. With this idea
in view It is understood a big meet:
ing to wind up the campaign with
Roosevelt, Taft and Hughes on the
same platform is already being dis
cussed.

WASHINGTON, July 7.—United
States marines expected to enter

there will be no more fighting.
