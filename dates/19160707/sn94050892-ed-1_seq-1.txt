CLIFTON ARIZONA, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1916.
NUMBER 7
t
CLIFTON OBSERVES
FOURTH IN SANE
1ER
The Day is Spent a'. Home by Ma
jority of Residents in a Quist Man
ner. Following the precedent set by sev
eral other towns in the state, Clifton
enjoyed a safe and sane Fourth. In
fact, with the exception of an oc
casional firecracker, the significance
of the day was all out overlooked.
The principal places of business were
closed as well as part of the works of
the Arizona and Shannon conper com
panies and the employees enjoyed the
day according to their individual
tastes. The majority of the citizens
spent a quiet day at home endeavoring
to keep cool and consuming large
quantities of iced drinks. Several auto
parties journeyed to different parts of
the valley where they spent the day
beneath the giant cottonwoods and in
cidentally enjoyed a plunge in the pla
cid waters of the Gi'a and Frisco.
The carnival opened at 2 o'clock in
the afternoon and many took occasion
to visit the attractions oftreed by the
oompany. The ball game between
Morenci and Clifton drew a large
crowd in the afternoon and the game
seemed to be enjoyed by everyone.
The picture shows as -well as the car
nival did an excellent business in the
evening and the day was concluded
without accident to mar its pleasure.
The dance given at the Princess
theatre In the evening by the Wom
an's Democratic League was attend
ed by a large crowd and was one of
the most enjoyable dances from every
standpoint that has been given this
season. The League netted a good
sum from the dance and the members
are more than pleased with the suc
cess of the undertaking. Ninety
couples were present and tripped the
light fantastic until a late hour, and
the amount taken in by the League
was $114.00.
It is also understood that a num
ber of our most prominent Personal
Users journeyed to Lordsburg on the
morning train and returned in the
evening with bulging suit cases, their
supply of the cheering beverage hav
ing been exhausted. Taking the day
as a whole it was one of the iriost
quiet spent in the district for several
years. .
A celebration no doubt would have
been arranged for the Fourth but as
the union men are making elaborate
plans for a big Labor Day celebration
It was thought best to give up the one
on the birthday of the nation's inde
pendence. It is only a pleasure de
ferred and the district will witness the
biggest celebration in its history if
the plans of the committee in charge
of arrangements for the Labor Day
fiesta are carried out.
HUNT ADHERENTS
ARE DEALT A
HARD BLOW
PHOENIX, July 2. The first real
test of the strength of the supporters
of Governor Hunt in Phoenix came
on' Tuesday when an ordinance pass
ed by the city commission was sub
mitted to the voters at a referendum
election. The ordinance in question
provided for the consolidation of the
offices of city clerk and city magis
trate, and will effect a saving of
about $3,000 per year to the city, with
out affecting the efficiency of the ad
ministration of the business of the
city court.
The referendum was secured by
petitions circulated by friends of the
governor, who desired to keep the
present city magistrate in office re
gardless of what it might cost the
city, as he is one of the chief sup
porters of the chief executive.
In spite of the fact that all of his
henchmen in the city worked against
endorsing the ordinance, and the
further fact that the "big white auto
mobile" of the governor was used
during the day to carry voters to the
polling places, the actio-i of tiie city
commission was tipprovod, and the
ordinance endorsed by a vole of
over three to oie in its favor, the
v.V" standiu:, 345 in n-
tinuin; the sinecun! of of lice, to 1 164
in favor of consolida.iicii.anri the sav
in? which it will produce in the ex
penses of the city.
This result was made possible be
cause the merchants, and the taxpay
ers of the city generally became alive
to the importance of the issu and
took the trouble to vote in sufficient
r.umbers to bring about the over
whelming defeat of those who still
believe a public office to be a private
snap.
Here From Eagle
P. L. Bailey arrived in Clifton the
first of the week from his ranch on
Eagle and is spending the week here
with friends. He took in the three
day celebration at Lordsburg where
be reports that there was something
doing all the time. The Senator re
turned to Clifton Wednesday even
ing and expects to leave for his ranch
home the first of the week.

Mr. Letcher, who is thirty-four years
old, was a company commander in
Cuba during the Spanish-American
war, and has been in the consular
service In Mexico for more than five
years.
METGALF HAS
Fire Destroys Theatre Sunday Night
at Which Time Six Houses Were
Also Wiped Out.
Metcalf was visited by a disastrous
fire on Sunday night about 10 o'clock
in which the Metcalf theatre and six
houses were completely destroyed.
The origin of the fire is unknown as
it had its inception in the theatre
building some time after the show
and the place was closed for the
night. Several rumors are in effect
as to the cause but no definite con
clusion has been arrived at as yet.
The theatre building was owned by
Zerapio Murillo and was leased to
Martin and Mason who were running
the picture show. The structure to
gether with the contents was. com
pletely burned up. The building was
insured for $1500.
Six houses in close proximity also
caught fire and the flames made short
work of them, all being burned to the
ground with but little of their con
tents being saved. These were part
ly covered by insurance. An attempt
was made on the part of residents to
subdue the flames but they had gain
ed such headway and burned so
fiercely that effective work was im
possible and they were finally left to
burn themselves out.
A high wind was blowing at the
time but changed directions at ap
parently the crucial moment or it is
thought that the enire town would
have been destroyed, as on account
of the dry weather the buildings were
in avhighly inflamable condition and
would Tiave burned like tinder.
It is understood that the burned
section will be rebuilt in the near fu
ture with better and more substan
tial structures.
Carnival Manager Joins Union
After doing a successful week's
business in Clifton and entertaining
big crowds every night, the Great
Commercial Shows which have been
holding forth on Riverside left Wed
nesday for Metcalf where they will
show for a week. The attractions
were all good and received a liberal
patronage from the Clifton public.
The first three days of the show last
week the company was handicapped
by a boycott put upon the entire out
fit by one of the local unions. The
manager was at a loss to account for
the 'boycott on his shows until it was
brought to his attention that he had
forgotten to take out a union card,
and upon learning the cause he at
once proceeded to affiliate with the
local union and the boycott was lifted
on Saturday night, after which the
shows received a liberal patronage.
It is hoped that the carnival com
pany will now have clear sailing and
be able to do business in other copper
camps of the state upon presentation
of their credentials. To the casual
observer this looks like a rather high
handed proceeding and it is under
stood that the majority of American
union men look upon the act with dis
favor and it is to be hoped that other
show companies appearing in the
district in the future will not be com
pelled to join the miner's union before
they can do business.
Leaves for Humboldt
H. H. Halter, who has been In the
employ of the Arizona Copper com
pany for the past four years, left
this week for Humboldt where he has
secured a position. Mrs. Halter and
on expect to join him in his new
home soon.
CONFLAGRATON
RENCI APPEARS
UNABLE 1(1
Although Piaying Good Games and
Close io Victory in Each One, Mo-
renci is Defeated in Three Games
This Week.
The Morenci ball team seems to be
pursued by a hoodoo which, like
Banquo's ghost, will not down. Al
though the boys are putting up an
excellent game of ball and are work
ing inperfect unison luck is against
them and when the game is apparent
ly in their favor the Clifton boys have
a streak of phenomenal luck and
grasp victory from their hands.
Three good games were witnessed this
week in each of which Clifton won.
While the games can scarcely be
called one-sided, as excellent ball h'as
been played on both sides, yet it
seems as though Morenci is unable to
break the good luck of the opponents.
Large crowds have been in attend
ance at all the games and interest in
the sport is on the increase, every
one feeling that they have value re
ceived for their money. The Sunday
game at Morenci resulted in a score of
12 to 5 in favor of Clifton. The
grandstand and bleachers were filled
with fans who enjoyed the game to the
limit and in spite of good playing on
the part of their home team they let
Clifton walk off with the plum.
Summary for Sunday's Game
Clilton Hits, 11; Errors, 4; base
on balls, 3; Struck out by McKenzie,
2; Eaton, 7; Home run, Eaton; 3 base
hits, Waidron, Ainslow.
Morenci Hits, 6; 3 base hit, Rog
gie; base on balls, 2. Errors, 3;
Struck out by Davis, 3; Jordan, 1. Dm
piie, Wakefield.
Among those from Clifton who at
tended the Sunday game at Morenci
were Norman Carmichael, F. N.
Flynn, S. C. Swift and wife, Wm.
O'Brien, Ben Grawtord and H. E. Bru
baker.
On the morning of the Fourth an
other game was played at Morenci
when the score resulted in favor of
Clifton by the tune of 8 to 3. Anotn
er large crowd was present at this
game and when it comes to rooting
Morenci is in a class by herself, but
they had to lay down in the seventh
when the Clifton wrecking crew,
Waidron, Eaton, Jennings, Campbell
and Azarte, came up and made eight
runs in the seventh and eighth. The
hitting of Campbell and Waidron for
Clifton was one of the features of the
game, while Warshum of Morenci,
made a nice double on a line drive
in the second inning and throwing the
runner out at the home plate. Davis
of Morenci pitched air tight ball
throughout the game but poor support
in the field cost him several runs.
All that Morenci now lacks for a first
class team are a good pitcher and
catcher. Capt. Porri, of Morenci, is a
good fast short stop and a clean lit
tle ball player, and with help , from
the fans will have a fast bunch ot
players in the Hill City before the
season is over.

The- afternoon game on the Fourth
was played on the Clifton diamond
which was witnessed by a record gath
ering, Clifton again winning by a score
of 7-3. Clifton's infield now looks
like class A ball and with the addi
tion to the team of the old veteran,
Mcllveen, the local boys have noth
ing much left to be desired in the
way of crack innelders. Campbell, of
Clifton, got six hits and a three base
hit in two games, and the fielding of
Jennings and Azarte was above par.
Also during the game Campbell handl
ed several hard chances at first. Mc
llveen secured three clean hits.
(Pretty fast hitting, Mac, for the
first time out in two years. You sure
look good on second, old timer.)
. Captain Eaton pitched god ball and
had the situation well in hand at all
times being assisted by eight other
Cliff Dwellers. Jennings made sever
al nice one-handed stops, cutting off
hits.

INCREASE
Assessments Fixed by State Tax
Commission Show 47.39 New Mile-
age; Toial Valise of all Carriers
, $92,064,402.
PHOENIX, June 29. Railroa'd prop
erty in Arizona has not increased
greatly in value over 1915 according
to the valuations fixed by the state
tax commission, which has fixed the
1916 assessed value of all carriers
operating in the state at $92,061,402,
an increase of but $1,019,629 over
1915, Railroad mileage for the period
increased but 47.30 miles, valued ap
proximately $325,000, making the net
increase in valuation about three
quarters of a million dollars.
Most Important Increase
The most important increase in val
uation made by the commission is an
increase of $500 a mile in the valua
tion of the main line of the Santa Fe,
thus placing it on the same basis as
the main line of the Southern Pacific.
Both of these roads are now assessed
at $65,000 a mile, but the Southern
Pacific having slightly the longest
line, continues to be the heaviest rail
road taxpayer in the state, paying
taxes on a valuation of $25,734,950.
The Santa Fe is a close second, its
valuation being fixed for 1916 at $25,
291,515. The El Paso & Southwest
ern system pays taxes on a valuation
of $10,460,020 or $24,000 less than in
1915. . The Arizona Eastern, ' a sub
sidiary of the Southern Pacific, says
taxes on an assessed valuation of
$19,304,200.
Several Decreases Made.
Half a dozen lumber and logging
railroads located in the pine forests
of northern Arizona have had their
assessed valuation cut $50 a mile,
while numerous small mining rail
roads, which have been taxed to ca
pacity hauling ore to mills and smel
ters, have been increased on the as
sessment rolls. Among the latter are
the Arizona Southern, which "recently
resumed operations with the blowing
in of the Sasco smelter, the Magma
railroad company, which was in
creased from $2,000 to $7,300 a mile
and the Mascot and Western, which
was raised a like amount.
The Congress Consolidated Copper
Mining Company pays the least taxes
on' its little road three and one-half
miles, long of any road in the state,
the'road being valued at only $1,800
a mile.- It has been idle for many
years . ".

$20,000 FIRE OCCURS
ON THE UPPER GILA
The Gila Farm Company suffered
a loss of $20,000 in a destructive fire,
believed to have been of incendiary
origin, which occurred early last
Thursday morning at Nogales, a small
settlement on Duck Creek on the
Mogollon road.
A large corn crib, containing 500-,-000
pounds of corn, the entire crop
harvested last year on the upper Gila,
together with 100 tons of hay, was
destroyed. The loss was total.there be
ing no insurance.
The fire will work a sereve hard
ship on freighters on the Mogollon
road, who bought large quantities of
corn and hay while traversing this
road throughout the year. They now
will have to carry a large part of their
feed along with them.
Immediately following the fire,
Thomas Lyons, of the Gila Farms
company, telephoned the Sheriff's of
fice here, requesting that the county
bloodhounds be sent to the scene
with a view to tracking the supposed
incendaries, but the dogs had been
taken to the southern part of the
county the day previous by Sheriff
McGrath to be used in running down
the murderers of William Parks and
wife, slain by Mexican bandits last
Tuesday at their ranch home south
west of Hachita. Silver City Inde
pendent. Candidate's Directory
The "Fat Kid" is now at work on a
candidate's directory which will be
posted In conspicuous places all over
the county. The directory will con
tain the names and offices of the can
didates and will be printed on a large
card board, copies of which will be
scattered profusely around the county.
This is a new departure in the line of
campaigning and one which ought to
meet with a ready response from
every candidate, as it will keep the
names before the public and will be
a convenient reference for both can
didates and voters. The Fat Kid is
already meeting with good success
and it is thought that all candidates
will subscribe to the new directory be
fore the primaries.
Hit by pitcher, Jennings, Eaton.

ment wish to thank subscribers to

MEXICAN KILLED
AT NEWTOWN
Body Found This Morning With Bul
let Wound Through the Heart Offi
cers on Trail of Murderer.
The dead body of Roman Mesa was
found this morning at Newtown be
hind Blackey's restaurant where the
murder had evidently been committed.
Upon examination it was found that
he was shot through the heart and
as the body was found about 8 o'clock
it is thought that he met his death
shortly prior to that time .
No cause has been attributed for
the deed but it is understood that the
dead Mexican was an all around bad
man and he had evidently had trouble
at one time or another with one of
his countrymen which led up to the
killing. The murderer's identity is
not definitely established although tb
officers nave a pretty good idea of
who committed the crime and are
working toward the end of his speedy
apprehension, and it is thought that
within a short time he will be behind
the bars.
No one seems to have witnessed the
killing or heard the shot and the offi
cers have but little to go on in their ef
fort to round up the criminal.
OLD AGE PENSION
LAW IS HELD
PHOENIX, July 3. The Supreme
Court this morning handed down a de
cision holding that the so-called old
age and mothers' pension law initiat
ed in 1914 is contrary to constitu
tional provisions and can not become
an integral part of the fundamental
law of the state.
The decision which was written by
Chief Justice Ross discusses the in
tricate . legal questions involved suc
cinctly, and clearly lays down the
law and the court's reasons for fail
ing to approve the measure.
With the knocking out of the pen
sion law but little remains of the
vaunted country saving initiated
measures upon which Hunt made his
latest campaign. One after another
when placed beneath the acid test of
the law they have been found want
ing and have been thrown into the
discard.
Briefly four basic reasons are found
for the decision:
First, because that while the act
provides for the sale of the county
alms houses no one is given author
ity to make the sale, and no aid is
given by the general laws in carry
ing out the provisions relating there
to. Second: Because the law provides
that it cannot be enforced until after
the sale of the alms houses, and then
says that pensions should be given
in the absence of alms houses.
Third: The subject matter abolish
ing alms houses is - not contained in
the title, and In this respect fails to
comply with the constitution.
Fourth: The law undertakes to
pension not only widows but wives
whose husbands are in prison or
asylums and who have children to
support regardless of whether they
are already In receipt of a competen
cy or not.
NVALID
IMPROVEMENTS FOR
TOWN ARE
HELD OP
Proposed New Civic Projects are
Held in Abeyance Pending Decision
of Legal Technicalities.
The proposed Improvements to the
town otr Clifton in which are includ
ed two new bridges, sewerage sys
tem and city hall, have been halted for
the time being owing to difficulties
encountered from a legal standpoint
in the bond issue.
It is understood that when the law
pertaining to a bond issue of this na
ture was placed upon the statute
books the law makers had in mind
towns where the homes and real es
tate are owned by the individual resi
dents and the majority of which is
not the property of corporations. It
appears that the taxes for a bond
issue must be assessed against the re
estate and improvements thereon if
these are made by the parties who
own the real estate. In the present
instance the burden of the tax would
fall upon but a few while the major
ity of the people who would benefit
by the improvements would pay noth
ing. This would exempt from taxation,
nearly every business house and
a great many owners of homes who
are paying ground rent to the com
pany. Hence on account of this diffi
culty the matter of issuing bonds for
the improvements is being held in
abeyance awaiting a solution of the
problem from a legal standpoint. To
this end the town council and Town
Attorney Ling are now working.
The different phases of the question
were discussed at great length at a
meeting of the council on Monday
night and it was decided not to take
further steps in the matter until
their position was made clear and they
could proceed with the work in a
satisfactory manner. The estimated
cost of the improvements now being
held up is approximately $100,000.
This would be divided between two
bridges across the Frisco river, the
estimated cost of which would be
$75,000 and a city hall to cost in the
neighborhood of $25,000. It is hoped
by the residents of Clifton generally
that the tangle will be unraveled and
that the improvements may be started
as soon as possible.
At the meeting on Monday night
a petition signed by some 300 name
was presented to the council asking
for the appointment of 15 extra depu
ty marshals. One was appointed for
Shannon Hill and it was left to the
discretion of the mayor to appoint
others as needed.
