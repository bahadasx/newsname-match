P
War Averted By Carranza Reply
Pershing: Withdrawing
Peace Possible
While soldiers are still being
rushed to the border of Mexico
and Gen. Pershing is withdraw
insr his army from its position
far in the Republic, there
ply of Carranza to this govern
ment has so far placated the ad
ministration that the press an
nounces the prospect for immedi
ate hostilities past. Carranza
complain about many things but
givesassurnce which have been
demanded.
Thw is about as much as can
be said on the subject with any
degree of accuracy, for we con
fess to being unable to figure
out just what conditions really
are. We do know and say, that
President Wilson is determined
to avoid war and consequent
sacrifice of American men if
such is possible, so we are not
so particular about details.

Fourth Sanely Celebrated
Merchants Met Expectations of an Immense Throng.
Assembled From Every Part of the County. Near
ly $800 in Prizes Distributed. Rain Bluffed Many.
The citizens, more particular
ly the merchants, of this city,
planned to celebrate the fourth j
of July in an unusual way this
year, and to that end collected
a fund of nearly $800 which was
invested in prizes, thirty five in
number and consisting of useful
articles from a Ford touring car
down to an umbrella.
The usual cheap exhibitions
were not on the program, and
the only attraction other than
the drawing for the prizes was
to have been a balloon and para
chute performance, but the
owner of the baloon wired the
morning of the third naming a
figure which the committee in
charge rejected at once. Beit
said that the commercial club
had so managed that no contri
butions were solicited to cover
the expense of the occasion.
No fairer day ever dawned on
the anniversary or at any other
diurnal revolution of our sphere.
Decorations were put up early
in the morning and general pre
paration for the main event com-
pieiea Deiore tne arrival or a
sufficient number to interfere,
but by nine o'clock the city's
streets began to fill and when
the band marched out to open
the day at ten o'clock, there
was as large crowd on hand as
had attended on some former
occasions of the kind. By noun
the city was full of people and
as many more to come after
taking of the hospitality of our
sister city, Salisbury. The draw
ing for the prizes was set to
begin at 2 o'clock and by that
hour the Price Park was more
than filled and as many still on
the various streets.
The Mendon Cornet Band had
been engaged for the occasion,
an organization only about a
year old, distinguished itself and
drew compliments from every
quarter, gave a concert in the
park from one o'clock to the
time of the drawing and in the
evening until after eight. The
willingness of the band to make
music every minute of the time,
the quality of the music rendered
and most of all, the gentlemanly
conduct of every member of the
band, made it admiring friends,
of all the crowd from out and
in the city.
General John Barker made a
short speech just before the noon
hour to a large and appreciative
audience at the park and just
after noon, Lieut Gov. Painter
addressed a large audience in
the park. Hon Jno. M. Atkin
son was in town and but for the
r&in would have made an address
either at the court house or on
the street at the conclusion of
the drawing, but ; the condition
of the weather being still un
favorable, Mr. . Atkinson left
without having the opportunity
to be heard.
There were quite three thous
and people in town and on the
park grounds when the drawing
began at 2 p. m. The duplicate
tickets had been cut and exam
ined by J. A. Washam of near
Pee Dee, Wallace Applegate and
Aleck Taylor, assistant cashiers
of our banks and J. A. Byerly of
the general arrangement com
mittee. The duplicate tickets

were placed in a barrel after
having been thoroughly mixed
and thirty four prize tickets
placed in a large hat box. The
barrel top was covered with a
canvas and a small hjJe made in
the canvas and asmalll slit made
in the top of the hat box. Mr.
Uufus Emerson was placed in
charge of the barrel of tickets
ai.d Mr. Grant Hurt in charge of
the hat box. Miss Jack Moore
drew tickets from the barrel and
Miss Francis Wood premium
tickets from the hat box. . The
tickets as drawn j were handed
by the little girls, the numbered
tickets to Mr. Emerson and the
prize tickets to Mr. Hurt. The
numbers as drawn were called to
the great crowd by Mr. Warren
Elliott. President of the Com
mercial Club and three minutes
was allowed in each case for the
ticket called to be produced.
Chief Tisdale kept guard over
the box containing the prize
tickets which was kept in sight
of the crowd all the time. Every
precaution was taken to make
everything connected with the
drawing as fair as possible and
to avert the right for the slight
est suspicion or criticism.
The drawing had proceeded
but a little when an approach
ing storm frightened many away,
but it was a bluff and the major
ity remained until a down pour
with heavy thunder got in its
par-fbluff and scattered hundreds
who had no shelter.
The drawing went on and the
number of tickets called and not
produced shows that none were
injured to any extent by their
absence, if such had any of the
tickets drawn. The usual bom
bardment, danger and annoyance
of crackers, nigger chasers, dyn
amite canes and still worse nuis
ance on such occasions, confetti,
were cut out of any place in this
celebration. There were no fa
kirs, those who came having such
shady methods that they were
not allowed to get busy. There
were but two refreshment stands
outside, but those who usuall
profit by the presence of lare
i crowds here had a fine trade and
! everybody made happy. There
were a few overloaded with some
thing besides soft drinks, bui
the police arrangement was such
that not a single disturbance or
complaint was made. The heavy
rain made the streets too muddy
to promenade at night and there
being nothing more than the band
concert and the picture show on
the evening program, the town
was pretty well deserted by
11 o'clock.
John G. . Ward was the
holder of the number (57090)
which called for the automohile,
and we have yet to hear one who,
failing to get the principal prize
himself, regrets that it fell to
Mr. Ward. While the day was
celebrated in an unusual way
there was more money put into
the entertainment by the mr
chants than for any himi a" oca
sion and the great portion of the
money spent benefited someone
instead of going up in smoke or
into the pockets of itinerant.
We give below the winri.g
numbers, names of lucky ones,
and the prizes;

but according to program. The

3500 to 5000, happy, enthusiastic
and contented people and began
arriving before nine o'clock.
The morning was spent in hand
shaking and renewing old ties
until the dinner hour when all
were filled to satisfy. The ar
rangement was orderly and sys
tematic and reflected credit on
the committee. The first stunt
was a pie eating contest by a
class of boys and was both spirit
ed and amusing, Harvey Sanders
being the winner, getting all the
pie he could eat, in the time al
lowed and a dollar as a prize. A
cracker eating contest followed
and was the only dry affair on
the program, Harry Carter be
ing the winner. Hon. J. M.
Atkinson candidate for nomina
tion for Governor was then in
troduced and made a sensible
conservative speech telling
why he wished to be Gover
nor. He was followed by Hon.

broadly at times. A violent
shower of rain cut off further

THE E
Allies Have Gained 9 Miles
Slaughter Unprecedented
Both Confident
The great drive against the
Central Powers army in France
begun by the Allies the latter
part of last week has netted a
gain of two German trenches,
and many guns, and advance
ment is still being made tho the
the Germans have checked the
main force.
Along a 90 .mile line the two
great armies have fljng at each
other all their available forces for
five days and nights and are
making the supremest efforts to
annihilate each other. Germany
had to send men to Poland to as
sist in checking the advance of
Russia and this together with the
continuation of the effort to take
Verdun, prevented massing suf
ficient force along the main bat
tle front to prevent England and
France from making heavy gains.
Russia is still pushing Anstria
towards her own boundary line
and England and France recov
ing lost ground. German troops
have been withdrawn from Ver
dun to reinforce the lines which
are suffering such loss.
The navel engagement due has
not got underway yet but may
be expected at any moment. All
other reports of the progress of
the great war have been subor
dinated to the accounts of pro
ceedings in France.
Crippled Candidate
James M. Hershey who seeks
to be judge of the eastern dis
trict of the county, has a road
louse in which he makes such
time that the other candidates
for the same office can hardly be
said to keep in sight. James
hitched up his fliver Saturday
and applied himself to the crank.
Henry kicked and yet was made
to go. Arriving at Bynumville,
Jim thot, as his wrist was given
him greater pain, that something
n ust be the matter with it, and
to settle the question and the
hurting he had a surgeon make
an examination. A badly sprained
wrist was what had been distrac
ting this candidates mind from
the more important business of
meeting voters, Bandages and
other applications assuaged the
pain, greatly assisted, of course,
by the encourgement he met.
The rain here Tuesday was of
great benefit to crops and our
farmers are happy.
Word comes fron Kansas City
that Miss Clara Clarkson who is
at the C. C. Hospital, recovering
from an operation is getting
along fine.
The Chariton county boy who
thrust his hand into a hole and
drew forth a live mink, hopes to
resume farm work in about three
or four weeks, if he can keep
blood poison out of his bitten
hand. Moral Don't catch
minks by hand.
Ray Windsor has been called
to the colors and is with his
regiment somewhere in S. C.
