NEW POLICIES APPEAR
Married Guardsmen Released

STEPS IN LINE WITH PROJECT
Wilson Expected Soon to Order the
Formal Withdrawal of Troops
from the Republic.
Secretary of State Lansing informed
Ambassador-designate Arredondo yester
day that Carranza's note is acceptable to
the United States and that this govern
ment's reply will be delivered today. Its
form has already been agreed upon.
The administration announced two poll
cdes yesterday that indicate the President
:s determined to carry out his plan of
sett:.g the Mexican question without in
tervention. They were:
First, that the National Guardsmen
wth families dependent upon them will
he exempted from service on the Mexi
can border. All stepe to exempt members
of the militia were resisted when the
President, after calling out the troops,
was preparing to interven,
Second, that American, remaining in
Mexico will be denied tie protection of
the United States. If killcd this govern-;
ment will consider it their own fault for
not heeding the warning to come out.
Withdrawal fxpected Soon.
The next step is expected to be the
issuance of a formal order to Gen. Funs
ton to withdraw the Pershing expedition
from Mexico. Mexican Emt asy officials
are confident the final withdrawal move
ment will be ordered within a week.
Another step considered In futherance
of the President's desire to conciliate
Carransa is the full recognition of Mr.
Arredondo as Ambassador from Mexico
and the dispatch of Henry C. Fletcher
to Mexico City to assume his post as
Ambassador of Mexico.
President Wilson and Secretary Ianbing
are understood to have agreed at their
conference yesterday that the American
reply will be brief, approximating the
length of Carransa's short note.
The main points on the reply to Car
ranza were outlined as follows:
The United States agrees to discuss fu
ture relations with Mexico directly be
tween the State Department and Car
ranza
No Referenees to Charges.
The United States will admit that the
presence of American troops is not jus
tillable if, as alleged in the Carranza note,
the Mexican government can maintain
order on the international border.
In announcing its willingness to with
draw America troops as soon as Car
ranza demonstrates his ability to handle
tesituation, the note will point out
this has been the American govern
ment's position from the first
Inasmuch as Carranza's note made no
reference to the charges made in the pre
ceding American note against the Mex
ican de facto government of insincerity,
duplicity, deliberate hostility to the
Unted States, and connivance with Villa,
the American reply will not refer again
to these subjects.
In the forthcoming diplomatic ex
changes between the State Department
and Ambassador-designate Arredondo, it
ass made plain yesterday the United
States Will not press at this time for
Indemnities for American life and prop
erty destroyed since the recognition of
the Carranza government.
Secretary Lansing went farther when
he made his announcement that if
Americans are killed hereafter in Mexico
It will be their own fault.
Mr. Lansing was asked the direct ques
tion as to what measure of protection
American citizens in Mexico would have
f the troops are withdrawn.
"None,' the Secretary replied.
