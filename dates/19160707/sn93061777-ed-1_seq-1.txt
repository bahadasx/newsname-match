$1.00 PER YEAR
Crisis In Mexican Situation Has Apparently Passed.
TROUBLE WITH
General Carranza the de Facto President has Tamed
Down and There Will Be No Hostilities for the
Present Unless Another Clash Should Occur.
Washington, July 5. Early
resumption of friendly diplo
matic relations with the de facto
government of Mexico to the
end that peace and order may
be restored in northern Mexico
and along the border, is expect
ed here to be the next step of
the United States in its relati his
with its southern neighbor. The
crisis precipitated by Villa's raid
on Columbus, N. M , and culmi
nating in the fight at Carrizal,
Mexico, between American and
Mexican troops, appeared to
night to have been dissipated by
an amicable note from General
Carranza, presented during the
day by his ambassador designate
here, ElUeo Arredondo. The
note proposes that the differ
ences between the governments
be settled by mediation or by
direct negotiations. It is re
markable for its brevity, its re
strained and friendly tone, and
for the absolute lack of any of
the strong language; which
characterized the lust two com
munications from the de facto
government. It treats as a
closed incident ihe exchange
of unfriendly communications
which brought war almost with
in Mght.
Washington, July (. The
Mexican de facto government
was informally notified that the
United States welcomed Car
ranza's proposal to adjust all
differences between the two
governments by direct diplo
matic negotiations. Secretary
Lansing informed the Mexican
Ambassador Designate Arredon
do of the United States' attitude.
He later communicated the in
formation to Mexico City,
Lansing virtually completed
the draft of the communica.ion
officially notifying Carranza that
this government was desirous of
settling the controversy and aid
ing in establishing peace and
order in Mexico. With the im
mediate purpose of the negotia
tions will be the evolving of a
plan tranquilizing the border
regions, the discussions may as
sume a wider scope.
President E. P. Ripley, of the
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe railway system, announces
that the company has decided
upon a plan of death benefits or
the beneficiaries of all employes
in the service two or more years.
Beginning July 1, the company
will pay to the beneficiary of
every employe dying in its ser
vice a Bum equal to five per cent
of his last twelve month's salary
multiplied by the numoer of
years of continuous service,
with a minimum payment of
$250, and a maximun payment
of one year's salary, not exceed
ing $3,000. It is stated that the
plan will be tried for two years,
but the hope is expressed that
conditions may enable the com
pany to continue it.
Claud Miller, the automobile
dealer, is spending a few days
in Oklahoma City with his fam
ily. Sam Kimberlin is in charge
of the shop during bin absence.
MEXICO
NOW APPEARS SETTLED
Republicans and
Progressives Join Forces
Santa Fe, July l.-The Re
publican and Progressive organi
zations in New Mexico have ar
ranged to work in harmony in
support of the national Republi
can ticket, according to an an
nouncement today by Charles A.
Spiess and Miguel A. Otero,
Republican and Progressive
national committeemen, respect
ively. The committeemen held
a conference here today.
4th at Texico
Clovis was almost entirely de
populated on the 4th of July the
majority of our people going to
Texico-Far well where a big cele
bration was held. A few went
to Havener, but the majority to
Texico. Horse races, a barbecue
and Held sports were the chief
attractions there. Ihe crowd
estimated at three thousand was
more than they were able to ac
comodate 'and the barbecue sup
ply ran far short of the demand'
Toe eating houses wi re ail over
taxed and it was a difficult mat
ter to get meali. What they
acked on this score, however,
they more than made up in pro
viding wet goods and the "thirst
parlors" were especially well
patronized, ft is said that they
sold $:(50().00 worth of the stuff
that made Milwaukee famous.
Four fights were staged which
provided excitement at least for
the participants. The last big
4th of July celebration held in
Texico wa9 nine years ago.
Luikart Having Sale
W. I. Luikart and Company
are having a big sale winch
started Thursday of this week.
It is the custom of this big dry
goods and clothing house to put
on a mid-summer sale each year,
just before their buyers go to
market to purchese their stock
of fall and winter clothing. Of
course a big reduction in prices
is necessary to move the goods
and Luikart always allows the
prices to drop very materially.
For further particulars, we in
vite you to see their big solid
composition circulars which were
printed at the News office last
week or their page ad appearing
in this week's issue.
Married
Zora Lobban and Miss Mabel
Simpson both of this city, were
married Monday evening, July
3, at the home of Rev. C. H.
Brown. Both the bride and the
groom are well and favorably
known here and their many
friends join in wishing these
young people a long and happy
wedded life. Mr. and Mrs, Lob
ban will mike their home on
South Thornton St.
B. W. Kieran of Lubbock,
Texas, was in the city a few
days this week. He was favor
ably impressed with Clovis and
surrounding country and may
decide to invest in Curry county
farm land.
Trip to Hollene
In company with Mr. and Mrs.
Uell Houk and W. M. Ogg, the
News man made a trip to Mr.
Ogg's farm north of Hollene
Sunday. We also visited the
breaks and took a short jaunt
over on the Texas side of the
line. The section north of Hol
lene hqs been favored with more
rain than other parts of the
county and the crop prospects
are particularly good at this
writing. The wheat especially
which is now being cut and
thrashed is a large yield and
better quality than we had sup
posed. The people of that see
tion appear prosperous and are
developing their places in good
shape. One thing that interest
ed us more particularly was tne
class of stock which have been
bred up and much improved in
recent years. The school houses
are well furnished and the
premesis kept clean and invit
ing. Hollene is in the center of
one or tne Dest stocK rarming
sections of the county and the
land there has trebled in value
in the past two years. This fine
section of the country is in the
Clovis trade territory and but
few of the people trade else
where. Mr. Ogg has a fine tract
of 3.0 acres of which a consider
ate portion is planted in wheat.
The most of the wheat raised ir,
the Hollene country this year
will make from fifteen to twenty
live bushels to the acre. During ;
last year and the year previous
it made from twenty to forty
bushels. We do not believe l hat
there is a section of country in
the state of New Mexico where
the people are as prosperous and
contented as in the Hollene dis
trict.
Herby Will Leave
II. C. Herby will leave Friday
ot this week for Albuquerque,
where he will become connected
with the staff of the Morning
Journal. While the position may
' become a permanent one he does
not expect at this time that it
will last longer than until after
the election in November when,
according to his present plans,
he will return to Clovis.
Mr. Herby has been the local
correspondent of the Journal for
the past ten months and has un
doubtedly been the best news
gatherer the Journal has ever
had here. Frequent comments
have been made by citizens in
various parts of the state about
the live news sent to the Journal
from Clovis. Knowing what a
news item is and being able to
write it up in a style that ii
peculiarly his own attracted the
attention of the Journal manage
ment, resulting in his being
selected for a position on the
staff of that paper.
Car Went Through Window
We have heard of Texico stuff
that would make a rabbit spit in
a bull dogs face, but we do not
know that wa3 the brand that
would prompt a chauffer to mis
take a drug store for a garage.
Anyway a Texico car driver sent
Hamlinu ford car through the
front window of Hunton's drug
store last Monday breaking the
large plate glass front.
Big rains have fallen at Mel
rose, Grady and Tucumcari dur
ing the past week. Clovis still
goes on record as being "dry."
Judge Dissolves Injunction
The Melrose disincorporation
case came up for a hearing be
fore Judge G. A. Richardson
Wednesday and the temporary
injunction restraining the town
authorities from enforcing ordi
nances was dissolved. In this
action it was sought to declare
the incorporation illegal and an
effort was made by citizens to
disincorporate. Others were
contending equally strong to
maintain the present city gov
ernment. A large array of wit
nesses for both sides were here
Wednesday and after hearing all
the evidence, the court decided
that the incorporation was legal
and dii-salved the temporary in
junction which had been granted
restraining the city authorities
from enforcing certain ordi
nances. Cement Motor Road
Conductor James F. O'Rouke,
of Tucumcari. is promoting a
motor road from that place to
Clovis, ana I'om what we can
learn from the press reports
about his plans, this new enter
prise promises to be next to the
best proposition for the rich
farming districts between the'
two cities, and should have the
fullest support of the people of
the -country between the two
poi.r.s.
It is planned to build a line of
ivment tracks forautos and auto
t-ucKs, the corporation putting i
on a number of Urge trucks for
the handling of any and all kind?
of freight, passengers and mail,
thereby making this proposition
next to a railroad.
If the promotors build this
road, we are for it, and we hope
that every good citizen will lend
his influence and heartiest sup
port to have this road built and
in operation at the earliest
possible moment. House News.
J, E. Owens has sold his stock
ranch just west of Elida to
Henry Jones and was in Clovis
this week on his way to Italy,
Texas, his old home where he
will visit his parents. Mr.
Oens will be back :o Clovis
about July 25th and may engage
in business here. He thinks
Eastern New Mexico has a great
future before it and says he is
going to make it his luture
home.
H. L. Langford had his hands
and arms severly burned last
week when cleaning a car with
gasoline which ignited through
a circuit caused by a metal
handle brush coming in contact
with a charged metal part in the
engine. But. for prompt help he
would probably have been
burned to death.'
A. W. Lionel and Buryl John
son and Temple Odom were at
tending the eelebration in Vegas
this week and spent several days
hunting and fishing on the Pecos
before returning Wednesday.
They report that about 10,000
people attended the celebration.

ional Guard were ordered ruhed
to the Elephant Butte dam 135

Bond Issue Invalid
It has been decided that be
cause of legal technicalities that
the $35,000 bonds for city im
provements which were voted at
the last city election cannot be
sold. In the meantime while
deals were being made to sell
the bonds, the city expended
several thousand dollars in drill
ing a well and making other im
provements, the city fathers
thinking there would be no ob
stacle in the way of making a
snle. The bond broken, how
ever, discovered the irregulari
ties und blocked the sale. It is
said that the statutes provide
that a bond isue cannot: be voted
by special election and in this
event a vote cannot again be
taken until the next general
election.
District Court in Session
Judge Granville A. Richardson
catiTi up from Roswell Monday
for the purpose of holding a
short session of court and to try
suc'n casps in which jury trials
are not demanded. Court Sten
ographer Miss Estes is also in

The thousands of state militia
passing through Clovis en route
to the border this week have
been the subject of considerable
interest to many people who
rushed to the depot at the ap
proach of every train.
Ed Joiner and family have
gone to Wichita Falls, Texas,
where Mr. Joiner expects to lo
cate and engage in business.
He says the town has 18,000 in
habitants and is a "hummer."
He has leased his house here for
six months to L. M. Irwin.
A. C. Pace returned Thursday
from Willow Oklahoma, where
he has been visiting for several
weeks. He reports the Okla
homa heat as very oppressive
and is glad to get back home.
Russell Hardwick is training
to become a league ball pitcher.
His first lessons in throwing
curves were t&ken at Texico on
the fourth by using eggs as a
substitute for a ball.
There will be preaching at
Ideal school house next Sunday
at 11 a. m. and at night. Rev.
Howard will preach at the morn
ing hour and Evangelist J. H.
Shepard at the evening hour.
Ben Stanton received a painful
injury to the fore finger of his
right hand while working at the
Santa Fe shops a few days ago,
which will necessitate him being
absent from duty for some time.
The streets of Clovis during
the past week have rebounded to
the martial tread of soldier boys'
feet. Nearly every day several
train loads of national guards
men from the east have passed
through here enroute to the
Mexican border, and the trains
going through in daylight have
stopped here long enough for
the troops to detrain and exer
cise. They were marched
through the streets and in a few
instances, at least, up as far as
the vacant lots just south of the
court house, where they were
put through maneuvers calculat
ed to rest them fio.n the long
rides on the trains that they had
been subjected io.
On the Fourth of July, about
noon, a train bearing companies
A. Li. C. and D 1st infantry
Pennsylvania National Guard,
the hospital corps and regiment
al officers, arrived here and re
mained for about two hours.
The troops were marched to the
Harvey House lawn where
Fourth of Juiy exercises were
held under the direction of Col.
Charles 0. Aliuii. The declara
tion of independence wa9 read
and America anil the Star
Spangled iianner were sung.
After these txei cists were over
the soldiers were marched to
South Main Street, where a
number of lout races were pulled
ott
Clovis people have turned out
n large numbers to see the
soldier boys pass through, and
many members of the fair sex,
in particular, havejbeen the re
cipients of souvenirs in the
anupe of samples of hard tack
with the donor's name and ad
dress written thereon. Also, in
some instances, if appearances
count for anything, the soldier
boys have carried away from
Clovis souvenirs in the shape of
the hearts of some of our fair
daughters. We wonder what
romances in the way of love af
fairs history will record in con
nection with this troop move
ment, Yes, we wonder.
