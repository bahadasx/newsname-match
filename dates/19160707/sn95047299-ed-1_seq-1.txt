Petitions have been in circulation
during the past two weeks in this city
by at least two men who want to run
as independent candidates for coun

The law provides that .a man can
get his name on the county ticket
in the general election by action of
the board of county commissioner
when 25 voters petition for his name
in ru uii ia uu independent candidate.
1 1 There have not been many ins-
iuai.L-.-i oi. uiepenueut candidates in
this county. Indcpendentism has
heretofore been looked upon by dem
ocrats as worse, if anything, than out
and out republicanism. These inde-
j podents as a rule are generally men

cratic primary nominations and who
refuse to abide them.
One of the petitions is being cir
culated just now bv Mr. E. Loomis.
y who wants the position of justice of
fjtiie peace, the place for which Jus
fjtice J. E. Marshall was nominated in
I J the democratic primaries of last

THE CAMPBELLS FEEL
SAFE ill MEXICO CITY
And Have Declined to Leave
Their Interests and
Come Home
The family connections of Mr. and
Mrs. J. II. Campbell in this city have
been greatly worried during the past
several months for their safety in
the City of Mexico, where the Camp
bells have resided for a number of
years and where Mr. Campbell has
iaige property interests. During
the past month of war preparations
their anxiety has been intense.
Mrs. Campbell is the daughter of
Mrs. S. II. Bass of this city, and it
will be remembered that two years
ago they spent several months in Pa
latka. Mrs. Bass had intended to
go to her daughter and had planned
to sail from Havana to Vera Cruz on
the iilst of last month, but was pre
vented by her inability to secure pass
ports. She wrote urging her daugh
ter and husband to come home, but
so far they have declined to do so,
believing they were perfectly safe in
Mexico City,
On Tuesday Mrs. Bass had a let
ter from the Campbells. They stat
ed that everything was peaceful in
that city and business was going on
as usual; that they attended the mov
ing picture theaters in the evening
and all was as peaceful as in Palatka
or any other American city. That
there was never any demonstration
against tho "gringoes," or Americans,
and that they felt perfectly safe,
The only thing that worried them
was the fact that they had to take
Mexican money for their rentals, and
it was worth but little, though no
complaint was made concerning its
scarcity. "They told me," said Mrs.
Boyd when telling of the letter, "that
a pair or snoes could not Pe nur-

The best news in Palatka this week
is the daily arrival of about 00,000
brick for the new Palatka special tax
roads. This brick is being distribut
ed along the line of the road between
the east end of the St. Johns bridge
to Hastings and as soon as a sufficient
number have been so placed, tho
Georgia Engineering Company, con
tractors for the road, will begin with
a force of men to lay the road.
It will be remembered that this
road beside running to Hastings,
where it will connect with the St.
Johns county brick road to St. Au
gustine and the southern boundary
line of that county, will also bo laid
to San Mateo, Federal Point, Orange
Mills, and other points on the east
side, and to Peniel and Rice Creek
on this side of the river.
The work should all bo completed
by the beginning of winter.
A large force of men will be employ
ed and the weekly pay roll will
amount to a considerable.

the appearance of a large white owl
which had appeared in the Magolia

birds were greatly excited at this un

this chattering and scolding on their

tions shall be allowed to stand long
enough we have no doubt that most of
them will be swept away by similar
decisions. It is true that neither of
these decisions has been passed on
by the supreme court, but it is prob
able that the higher court would sus
tain the decisions of the lower. There
is a feeling w'hich even the courts of
ten respect that mere technicalities
.-.hould not defeat justice. That law
should be based upon common sense
is a rather well accepted theory; the
law which is not based upon common
sense and operr.tes to defeat justice
will not stand the test, and it is for
unate that this is so. Orlando Reporter-Star.
Diarrhoea Quickly Cured.
"About two years ago I had a
severe attack of diarrhoea which
lasted for over a week," writes W. C.
Jones, Buford, N. D. "I became so
weak that I could not stand upright.
A druggist recommended Chamber
lain's Colic. Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy. The first dose relieved me
and within two days I was well as
ever." Obtainable everywhere.
The board of county commissioners
on Wednesday made the levy for tha
present, year, and after much figur
ing decided on a total levy of 15 mills,
distributed as follows:
Scool Fund 5 1-2 mills.
Interest and Sinking Fund, 2 1-4.
General Fund, 3 .
Road Fund, 2 1-2.
Bridges, :5-4 mill.
Fine and Forfeiture, 1 mill.
This is a total of fifteen mills, as
ugainst 10 for last year. This levy
however does not take into consider
ation the special tax school district
levy, nor the special tax in the road
and drainage districts. The millago
for the Palatka special tax road dis
trict will be (! mills additional, and
that for the Bostwick special road and
drainage districts will be twelve mills
additional.
But in parts of the county where
the people are not buying anything
additional, the levy will be four mills
lighter, provided the state levy is
the same. This, however, is not
likely to be higher, but may be less.
The county school board which met
on Wednesday and which squared ac
counts for the fiscal year just closed,
reported a surplus of over $7,000, and
Superintendent Cottingham, as well
as the members of the school board
are delighted. The report of this
board and its doing will appear in a
later issue.
It it Now Doctor Lynn.
Rev. L. R. Lynn of the Springfield
Presbyterian church, Jacksonville, has
just been made a doctor of divinity
by the Suothwestern Presbyterian
University, Clarksville, Tennessee.
Palatka friends of Dr. Lynn will be
rejoiced at this recognition of his
learning and spirituality. In Jack
sonville, where he has served ths
Springfield church for the seven years
since leaving Palatka, he is as popu
lar as in this city, where he also
served about seven years and where
he is still honored and loved in many
households.
