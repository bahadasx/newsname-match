Creek. ! -
Tho City Council In special session
Monday night passed a resolution for
the paving of Sixth Avofaua from
Mnin Eitrcot north to tho Normal
school property. Not a member of
the council opposed tho resolution,
nnd all membors woro present save
E. C. Terrell, who has been away
from the cfty two weekft, owing to
the death oj his father. '
Tho resolution contemplates an aS-
phalt pavement thirty feet frOm curb
to curb" withlfteon-foot curb space
on either side of the paved centch
Tho engineer's estimate, which will
be gotten up at once, will include
cxcavutlon, paving, curbing and gut
tering. , The council went on record
as favoring tho city's defraying tho
cost of building the bridge across the
creek near tho normal. Tho reason
for this 1b that the cosfof the bridge
will be more than tho abutting prop
erty is worth, and taxing this addi
tional expense to- the almost value
less property would smack of confis
cation of property.
