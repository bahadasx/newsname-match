The wnr Bitimtlon has never looked
so durk for Germany as at present.
Tho effort to break tlip French lino
nt Verdun hits failed after thousands
of men have been sacrificed. Now tho
French and English havo launched a
tremendous drivo against tho Teutonic
linicsv with the result that they havo
gained ground, Inflicted terrible losses
and captured mniiy prisoners. The
Germans arc still strongly entrenchod
on French soil, but they nro no longer
on tho offensive. Tho Russians, handi
capped nt first by luck of equipment,
are now sweeping forward over tho
fields from which they were driven a
year ago. They arc back on tho slopes
of tho Carpathian mountains and arc
threatening to pusli forward to tho
ricli wheat fields of Hungary, whero
tho supplies hnvu comu from which
havo fed thousands of tho soldiers of
tho central powers on the various
fronts of battle. Tho Italians, on tho
otlicr side, arc also a grave menace to
tho Austrians. Tho war ig likely to
drag along for many weary months,
but tho entente allies on every sido
oxcept the Balkans arc pushing tho
fighting. That Germany and Austria
will bo beaten in tho end now seems
certain.
Safety on highways ought to receive
more attention. Speed (lends and drunken
drivers arc already attended to by laws,
but there nie many very teal dangers
which havo received no attention. One of
these is the road inteisection where thick
shrubbery or tiees make it impossible for
tho driver on one sticet to bee on op
proocliing vehicle on the other until the
two ate teady to collide. Slow diiving is
of little avail in such places; the only
lumody is lo clear away the obstructions
to bight, as is required by regulation in
boiue places. Another danger spot is the
nailow road with sharp curves where it is
impossible to see ahead on account of
blirubs and trees. Automobiles have con
sidorablc trouble at times when they meet
on such curves, but the danger to them is
by no means mi gicat as it is to the young
man who is holding his best girl in
buggy and neglecting his horse. Such an
obstruction in the center of a narrow
winding road is not quickly guided to the
side where it belongs. Underbrush ought
to bo cleared away on the inner side of
such curves, nt least so Hint a driver can
detect another vehicle on the road ahead
before it is nearer than 75 feet. This docs
not require the destruction of shrubbery
or trees, but merely enough thinning out
ot the growth to enable a carriage or
motor ear to bo seen. Still another danger
point is the junction of a road with an
other at right angles, concealed by an in
tervening riso or curvo so that the junc
tion point is not seen until just before the
moment when the driver on the joining
road must turn into the main read. Such
.places arc extremely dangerous and sign
posts should be erected to wain the trav
eler of their proximity.
WAE DANGER AVERTED.
Carranza's Noto Likely to Bring
Friendly Relations Botwcon U. S,
and Mexico.
Early resumption of friendly iliplo
matic conversations with the de facto
government of Mexico to the end that
peace and order may 'bo restored in
Northern Mexico and along tho border
is expected here to be tho next step of
the United States in its relations with
its Southern neighbor.
Tlio crisis precii)itat"d by Villa '3
raid on Columbus, rs. and culmin
ating in tho light at Carrizal, Mox.,
between American and .Mexican troop?,
appeared Wednesday to havo been dis
sipated by an amicablo note from Gen.
C'arrnnza presented during tho day
bv his ambassador desisnato in Wash
ington, Ehseo Arrcdondo.
C'lirruiiza proposes that the differ
enccs between the nations bo adjusted
bv mediation of other nations or by
direct negotiations between Mexico
and tho United States.
Ho simgosts in effect that pending
settlement, by negotiation or media
tion, no new military moves bo innu
unrated bv cither nation nlong tho
border, that a military status quo as
of thu date of the Columbus raid, bo
maintained.
Ono proposal is that camps of Mex
ican government troops and United
States soldiers be established on their
respective sides of tho border ot in
tervals nnd tlnff information of the
movements of bandit raiders bo inter
changed by oflicers of theso camps so
that operations against such raiders
may be curried on by either forco on
its owl side of the line.
The wording nf the noto shows nono
of the strong, oven insolent, character
of tho previous Oarranza communica
tions on this subject nnd displays an
apparent desire to conciliate the Unit
ed States.
Olllcials in Washington believo that
all danger of war with Moxieo has
been averted, for tho present, nt least.
