son is- also pleased with camp.
The Fourth was observed, after a
fashion, after all. 'At reveille, there
was a sputter of firecrackers all over
the brigade, and consequent yells of
"rookie!" from the older men. Dur
ing the forenoon General Kirk sent
out an order that there would be no
afternoon drill, and this helped a lit
tle, flowever, as there was rifle
practice, administering of typhoid
serum, smallpox vaccination, the
counting of property and ordnanceJ
stores, and various other little things
there was little Idling among the of
ficers. Many of the men were busy,
too. The day was warm and sunny,
and bathing in the lake was very en
joyable. Company II had a holiday Monday
if going through the physical ex
amination with its attendant strain,
can be called a holiday. The men
took the typhoid vaccination Monday
and as a result get twenty-four hours
rest in quarters.
All are jubilant at the good show
ing made on physical examination.
Thanks to the close physical exami
nation given recruits "by the sur
geon, Capt. Harold A. Hume prior to
the departure from the home sta
tion, Lieut. Arnold declares the per
centage of men lost is the smallest of
any infantry company in the brigade.
There is general satisfaction that
Capt. Parker and Lieuts. Lahmann
and Whiteherse passed. The lieuten
ants, except for the doubt and ner
vousness which possesses anyone fac
ing an ordeal on which so much de-
( pends, believed they were in good
, shape physically. Capt. Parker fear-
ed that ho would not pass, but it is
evident that his knowledge as a phy
sician caused him to overestimate his
defects. The three officers are work
ing harmoniously, are well liked by
the men, and are building an efficient
organization.

A TOWER OF BABEL.
The Carl Hagenbeck-Wallace Shows
is One of the Largest Cirous
Organizations in the World.
Circus life is not without its reward.
i The work is hard, bnt the life is in the
open. The fields and the trees are
J green. The skies distil health for all
nature. Husbands, wives, sons, daugh-
ters, uncles and aunts trayel together.
Like the snails, they take their homes
around with them. These Jhomes are
the sleeping cars. Necessarily, they
are modest in space, but they are made
to bloom cheerily by a genuine domes
tic pride.
' The most wonderful circus in the
world is the Carl Hagenbeck-Wallace
Shows. It is a tower of Babel. The
employees, numbering about 1,000,
speak a'niost every language under the
son. The social side of this big family
i? interesting. There are card clubs,
woman's club, clown society, cosmo
politan club and baseball team.
The feminine touch of refinement is
to be seen abouf the living parts of the
circus tents, as well as in the cars. The
dressing tents have no hardwood floors,
but soft carpets are spread over the
grass and on these each artist gathers
her little party. The cosmopolitan club
was started last Benson. Very few of
Its members speak English and they
stumbled hopelessly. It is a polyglot
crpwd, working far from home and
needing such fellowship. At present
they are learning to peak- English un
der the guidance of a little American
rider. There are fitty children with the
show. Many are the sons and dangh
ters of performers; in a sense born to
the business. Others are the children
of relatives. Some are apprenticed.
The boys and girls go to the circus
school and study with greater zest be
cause of eplenaid physical health and
six months' separation from pchool
routine. Their teachers are furnished
by the management.
When the big show comes to Owosso,
Wednesday, July 12, the first thing
that will be noted is its vast improve
ment. From its first day of existence
it has grown rapidly year by year, but
never before has it shown such progress
as in the recent, years. . In every large
city in the world the Carl Hagenbeck
Wallace Circus maintain i an offioe. In
everv 3an8le forest and everglade trap-
persare on the constant hunt. Thus
novelties are assured. It matters not
what the cast may be, anything that Is
curious and interesting, and any per
former whose methods are novel are
secured at once. .
