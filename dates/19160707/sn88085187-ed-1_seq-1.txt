The brightest, breeziest, most entertaining paper in Taooimi
—that's Tlie Times. We admit it, and, as Sergeant Trycc. of
Troop B, told the Commercial dub, "we can prove it.' Every

TO KNOW, That's why it sells like hot cakes.
Tomorrow, just for example, it i* going to contain the first
of a series of article by Herbert Quick on "The Assassination
of the Progressive Party, Age 4.''
Then there will be a story you will want to read about Mr*.
Woolsey. who has sold her children's home.
Mabel Abbott is visiting a golf links—for the first time as
a player—and she is going to have some interesting remarks
to make on that ancient game.
Another reporter has been inquiring into the spankings that
prominent Tacomans have suffered; his recital surely will
make fine summer reading.
Fire Chief Carlson tells what to do in case you are caught in
a burning building 1. •
These are just a few of tlie many features. Then there will
l>e ALL the news worth while, the always-funny Everett True
and Duff comics and the ever readable Cynthia Grey, "Con

It's the paper you simply gotta buy if you're going to be a

that, "tips" regarding police raids

Remann that they did not want
either Detective Shaw or Deputy

anything further to do with inves
