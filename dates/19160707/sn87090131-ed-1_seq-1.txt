THE SIGN AT THE GALLOWS.
This is a harrowing story, but it has
a large and valuable moral, which
should be pasted in the hats of all
men who serve on juries in criminal
cases.
Sunday, May 7, 1797, was a beau
tiful day. The skies were blue, and
the birds were singing, and the young
man's fancy lightly turned to thoughts
of love. Sydney Fryer, a wealthy
young citizen of London, called upon
his cousin, Anne Fryer, and asked her
if she wouldn't like to take a walk, and
she said she would. So they strolled
around the streets until they reached
the suburbs, where there were fields
and commons. Presently they heard
a cry for help, and Sydney said:
"Some woman is in distress! I must
go to her rescue."
Anne tried to persuade him to pay
no attention to the matter, but Syd
ney was too gallant a gentleman to
turn a deaf ear to a damsel in distress,
so he vaulted over a five-foot wall.
from beyond which the cry had come,
and, instead of finding himself in the

presence of a spffering female, he was
faced by three ruffians, who told him
to hand over his valuables. Sydney
drew his sword, intent upon giving
battle, whereupon one of the robbers
fired a'ptstol at him, and he fell dead.
Mear the report of the pistol,
Anne i ctIbled up the wall until she
could. s otvr it, aq beheld her
coua-s-*Sg sed and is assailants
fleeing fom the scene. She reported
the crime to the authorities, and dili
gel heartc was made for the murder
ers, with the result that three young
men soon were in custody. They were
Martin Glench, James Mackley and Jo
sephSmith. 'lley had a local reputa
tion for wildness, but had never been
suspected or accused of crime. bnne
Fryer identified Clench and Mackley
at once. She was absolutely josItve

tion of the two. Tov'whole asel rested
upon her testimoy,, and the jury evi
dently agreed with her that she
couldn't be mistaken, for Clench and
Mackley were convicted of murder,
and Smith was acquitted. The verdict
was somewhat surprising, because the
instructions of the court favored the
prisoners. The learned jurist pointed
out that too much reliance should not
be placed upon the testimony of a
young woman who must have been
wildly excited at the time of the crime.
Mackley accepted his death sentence
with sullen resignation, as though he
considered it a part of the day's work;
but, Martin Clench, who was a fine,
intelligent young man, protested bit
terly in open court, saying that he was
no more a murderer than the judge on
the bench.
Having been sent back to jail to
await the day of execution, Clench de
voted most of his time to religious
study, and the mantle of Elijah de
scended upon him. He began to make
prophecies. He said that heaven
would not permit two innocent men to
be executed without some sign that all
men might understand. .
"Mark my words," he was wont to
say, "there will be a sign at the gal
lows, proclaiming our innocence."
This idea became an obsession with
him, and he talked of little else during
his last hours.
On June 5 the gllows wag eeected
before NewgAte prison, and the usual
immense mobha; gathered toosee two
unfortunate men pay the price. It was
a trusty old gallows that had been
used on many.previous occasions, and
the indications were that it had a long
career of usefulness before it. The
fatal hour arrived, and the doomed
men appeared upon the scaffold, the
doleful chant o6 the bellman still ring
ing in their ears:
All ye that in the condemned hole do lie.
Prepare you, for tomorrow you shalldle.
Watch all and pray, the hour is drawing
near,
That you before he Almighty shall ap
pear.
Examine well yeelves, in time reDent.
That you may I to eternal flames be
sent.
And when St. Sepulcher's bell tomorrow
tolls,
The Lord above ba-e mercy on your
souls!
The usual ocials appeared upon the
gallows with Clench and Mackley.
when the sign predicted by Clench was
given. The whole gallows collapsed,
and prisoners, jailers, executioner and
priest went down in a heap.
Martin Clench sprang to his feet and
triumphantly cried that the sign had
been given. And it was even so, but
it didn't do Martin any good. Carpen
is ters went to work at once, and soon
h had the scaffold in shape again, and
11 the two wretched men were again
al escorted to the platform and turned
off. For a little while their curious
u- story, with its coincidence at the gal
id lows, furnished a topic for my Lord
ig Topnoddy and the other bloods who
ts never missed a hanging, but the gal
iy lows was making its own kind of his
in tory almost every day then, and no
er man's story could hold public atten
id tion long.
'd Clench and Mackley were almost
'd forgotten when a man named Burton
is Wood was tried and capitally convict
rd ed for some offense. Finding that he
was doomed, and wishing to make his
st conscience as easy as possible, he con
fessed that he was the slayer of Fryer,
ty and related that when the crime was
d- committed he was accompanied by a
to man named Timms. Then came the
is, further intelligence that Timms, also
11. under sentence of death, was in jail
ie, at Reading. Being questioned, he cor
le rohorated Wood's story in every de
tail. There was no possibility of a
doubt as to the innocence of Clench
and Mackley, but they no longer cared
anything about earthly justice or in
justice.
For several years thereafter an old
residence in Shepherd street was much
gazed at by the curious. Londoners
pointed it out to their visiting kin
from the country. One of the rear
windows was heavily barred with iron,
and sometimes a ghastly, phantomlike
face was seen at that window.
"That is Mistress Anne Fryer," the
Londoner would say to his wondering
cousin from the back districts. "She
sent two men to the gallows by giving
mistaken testimony, and when she
learned the truth she became a raving
madwoman. She is kept in that room
all the year round, and sometimes
w!hen she is violent they gag her and
bet to the floor."
,*.remarked in the beginning, this
has a moral, and it should
ed and hung up wherever mor
n is engaged in the administra
of justice.
Good Results With Alfalfa Flour.
Alfalfa flour is one of the new prod
ucts that are being prepared for the
market. It is blended with wheat
flour, as the alfalfa protein does not
supply the necessary elasticity.- The
unbleached flour gives to the food a
characteristic green color. The ad
vantages are to be found in the lower
cost and greater food value.
The food classes have been working
with the flour and have had very sat
isfactory results, substituting alfalfa
for wheat flour in muffins, biscuit,
bread and cake. There is a slight
characteristic flavor that is objection
able to some people, but in most cases
it is a very satisfactory substitute.
