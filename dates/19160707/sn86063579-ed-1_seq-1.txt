Then came the reul business of the
evening, the passage of an ordinance
regulating the saloons and providing
penalties. This is such an important
and far-renching document that our
readers are requested to rend it in
full in this issue.
One other ordinance, abolishing
punch bonrds nnd other forms of
gambling was passed.
The ordinance regarding the burn
ing of rubbish is likewise published
in this issue and should he carefully
read.
TUNIS AND RED MOUNTAIN
Fourth of July was spent in a quiet
manner by our community, who met
at Tunis school house bringing their
dinners along for a family picnic,
after which E. F. Hurt read the De
claration of Independence in a mild
and soothing manner, that put one
ladv to sleep. I have heard of minis
ten talking people to sleep, hut never
a farmer before. Maybe Mr. Hurt
missed his calling.
The balance of the day was sepnt
in singing songs, speaking by the lit
tle folks, reading and recitations and
then a social gathering and talk for
which the Red Mountain people are
noted for.
We are sorry that ft. B. Johnson,
who left for Montgomery, Texas, on
Monday July 3, is leaving our com
munity for good.

factory, he wits demanded to halt by
mounted deputies Hlnck and flruham,
whom he nustook for Mexicans and
in his confusion acted so strangely
