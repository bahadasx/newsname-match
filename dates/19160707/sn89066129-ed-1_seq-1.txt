ranks of automobile owners, having
Wednesday bought a Grant Six of
the Power Garage. F. R. Power
and Mr. Eymau went to Kansas
City Thursday and will drive the

Several auto loads from Laclede
were at Linneus Monday night to
see the youngsters of that town
enjoy the fireworks provided by
the citizens for their entertainment.
Harmless fireworks were furnished
free to all children and they cer
tainly had a good time. The band
furnished good music, there was &
large crowd out and i t was a real
safe and sane gathering.
Alva M. Reid, who left Laclede
when a boy thirty years ago, spent
the first of the week here with his
aged mother, Mrs. "Elizabeth Reid.
This was his second visit to the old
town since he left here and he was
a stranger to even his old school
mates. He is engaged in railroad
ing and lives in Kansas City.
Before returning nome he left a
dollar and will receive The Blade
a year.
While the rain of Tuesday after;
noon was a damper on celebration
crowds it was the finest thing that
could happen to growing crops and
was worth thousands of dollars to
the farmers. It came gently and
continued about two hours and did
the most good possible. Corn
where properly worked is making
a phenominal growth and pros
pects are very encouraging at this
time. The harvesting ot a beayy
oats crop will be on next week.
F. R. Power and Thornie Lainme
went to Kansas City luesday
morning ana drove nome tnat
afternoon in the new Grant bix
that Mr. Lamme purchased of the
Power Garage last week. It began
raining on them at Plattsburg and
with the exceptions. of a few miles
this side of Cameron where the
rain was not heavy they had mud
all the way home, but mud and
hills amount to nothing to a Grant
Six and they arrived home in good
shape and on good time.
Mrs. L. B. Standly expects soon
to go to Ohio to reside with near
relatives. In order to show re
spect to her and wish her Uod
speed a large number of her many
friends gathered at her home on
Wednesday evening to spend sever
al hours in social converse. Rev.
H. J. Dneker, her pastor, made
some appropriate remarks and pre
sented a box fit linens as a token of
ove and good will. Friends that
arranged the surprise served de-
eciouar refreshments. The whole
was a very pleasant affair. .
Our Oiled Streets
Laclede's oiled streets and roads
are. attracting so much favorable
attention that the Standard Oil
company refer to them in a bulletin
just issued on the subject of oiled
roads. Yesterday The Blade re
ceived a letter from II. P. Holmes,
secretary of the LaPlata commer
cial club, stating that some mem
bers of the club were in Laclede
last Sundav and they were so
favorably impressed with the
results we were getting that they
wanted to know what system we
used in spreading the oil, " equip
ment used and how the roadbed
was. prepared. The good results
obtained in Laclede is largely due
to the intelligent way in wnich the
nil was applied. But not every
town can obtain the services of so
i-ompetent a committee as Laclede
had to do the work. Cashier II .
W. Lomax of the Lomax & Standl.v
hank, and M. P.. Benson, cashier
of the Benson Banking company,
donned overalls and not only di
rected but did most of the work
and the results show that they per
formed the task in a very satis
factory way. In street and road
oiling Laclede has taken the lead
in this part of the state,

Saxon "Six" Wins at San Diego
The hill climb, which the Saxon
won was the most grueling ever
staged. Contestants in this event
were required to drive down the
55 per cent grade of Exposition
hill and up the 35 per cent pitch.
Then the drivers were obliged to
turn around and reverse the order
of descending and climbing. The
Saxon not only made the best time
but was one of the few cars able
to reach the top of the 55 per cent
grade.
The Saxon -defeated one 11
cylinder car and two 8 cylinder
cars in the quick getaway event.
A Saxon "Six" left Kansas City
this July the first and was driven
300 miles averaging nearly 27
miles to the gallon of gasoline. Do
you know of any other car that can
approach this record! When you
know what the Saxon contains it
will be easy for you to understand
whv the Saxon always wins. If
you want a Saxon this year it
would be well to get your order in
now. Brown Auto Co.
