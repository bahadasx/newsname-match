ial Situation, that I am asking
the jkindriess of the editor of the
Democrat to allow me to make.a
.statement through the columns
:of his paper.
First, without regard to my
personal preferences as to can
didates, I sIihII try to present a
fa(jr-.apd Impartial surrey of the
political fie'iTae it appears to me
at the present lime, and to note
the trend of uvents as Hie cam
paign of Hie several candidates
proceeds and1 as the battle, judg
ed from a stale-wide viewpoint,'
seems to be developing.
Of Hie seven candidates in the
field, three are conceded to pos
sess formidable strength, strong
personal following, Influential
supporters and each with a state
wide campaign organization,
which is being, conducted with
intelligence and vlr. These
three are Atkinson, Gardner and
RoacH.. Of the other four, Iwo
at least, ire difficult to place;
aware that answers will differ. I
refer to Attorney General Barker
and Lieut. Gov. Painter. -
A few months ago General
Barker appeared (o have consid
erable strength; but there seems
now io he a general impression
that ha has lost in recent months,
and his opponents think, or pre
tend, to think, that he Is not ser
iously in the running. But Bar
ker is a resnuroeful campaigner,
and no one knows what a whirl
wind campaign 'will aocomplibh
on ' a home-stretoh. However,
the 'chsnoeB seems big against
him, hence, I put him in the un
known quantity list.
Likewise, Gov. Painter. The
Governor's strength now seems
to be purely local, but he has
some influential friends who will
support him if he oan prove that
he has a chance to win. He has
not shown them yet. Can he
show them The chances are
against him at this time.
'This leaves Houohin and Lind
say. They are exoellent gentle
men, eaoh isj making a vigorous
oampalgn and will poll a consid
erable vote. . Hut they cannot
win, the wind and the tide are
gainst them, the nomination
will be won by one ot the first
three mentioned.
The oandidacy of Mr. Gardner
has tiad a great deal of publicity,
due to hia proposed Land Bank
Measure, and for awhile his
strength seemed to be formidable.
That be still Is strong there can
be no dcubt; hn; for several
weeks there has bean consider
able evidence that he is losing
ground, and, at present there can
be no doubt that his strength if
waning.
The raoe seems now to be
clearly between Atkinson and
Gardner, with Gardner, as I said
before, losing ground and Atkin
son gaining everywhere, in
many sections of the Slate he la
gaining rapidly. Mr. Atkinson's
increasing strength is due to s
number of things, whioh I will
try impartially to mention.
First, it is thought that Mr.
Atkinson will make the strong
est possible candidate that oan
be nominated to run on the tic
ket with President Wilson. It is
believed that his record,, both
private and publio, is absolutely
unassailable and that he can poll
the fall party vote throughout
the state and will draw consider
ably on the Independent vote.
Seoond, Atkinson is absolutely
trusted by every legitimate inter
est, faolion, class and seotlon of
the slats. He has the confidence
of the farmer, manufacturer, and
shipper, and is thoroughly trust
ed by both capital and labor, by
employer and employee. v-
If nominated, it is known that
he will enter the oampalgn with
out a single handicap, and with
every prospect of leading the
party to victory. Unfortunately,
considering the present criticism
and the fight being waged
against oertain of his opponents,
so rauoh cannot be said with re
ference to some of the other can
didates. Another very important factor
in Mr. Atkinson's favor is the
faot that he is the only candidate
that represents thst large and
growing section of the state
known as Southeast Missouri. It
U a fact that in almost a century
of the state's existenoe South
east Missouri has furnlahed but
one governor, and that so long
ago as to ba almost nnknown to
the present generation. South
east Missouri has long complain
ed about this treatment, and Just
ly so. She is now fortunate in
having a man to represent her
that is clean, able, popular and
worthy in every way of the earn
est and loyal aupport of hia
neighbors. For the seoond time
in almost a century she has the
opportunity to furnish to the sta'.a
a chief exsoutive. ; Will she let
the opportunity go by f
St. Louis, it in almoot eertalr, -will
give a surprisingly large
yote to Atkinson. Some of the
strongest and most influential
men of the city are supporting
him and a strong organization is
being effected in every ward in
the city. One by one the news
papers, both city and country,
are coming out strong for Atkin
son, showing a strong trend of
sentiment for him and forecast
ing his almost certain success.
From all over the etate it it
asked, "How is Sou Hi east Mis
souri" If she slioks to Mr. At
kinson and will Join hands with
the. other sections of the state,
Southeast Missouri will for the
second time In her history be able
to elevate one of her eons to the
chief maglxtracy of the state.
The deolsion rests largely with
the DemooratB of Southeast Mis
souri. If that section of the state
votes for her home man, as would'
naturally bs expeoted, John M.
Atkinson will be the Democratic
nominee for governor.
The gavel with whioh iheDem- '
ocratic convention was rspped to

1861, and wat only torn, down a
few months ago. The walnut
was raised in Phelps oounty. It
is easy to oompute the length of

Joe Mcintosh lost the cap off
the radiator of his Ford oar. He
thought some one had either
stolen it or played a joke on him
and he waa a little out of humor
about it. Monday he brought
hia mules to Arthur Prime to
have their hoofs trimmed. Among
the dirt on one of the mule's feet
the lost pieoe was found. The
mule looked around and smiled
and Joe said, "Well, I'll be gosh I"'

Without laying claim to spec
ial prowess with a rifle, a Btlee
oounty hunter has gained some
distinction as a marksman by
killing a rabbit and oalf at out
shot. One day recently, acoord
ing to the Butler Times, the bun
ter went out to drive soms cattle
from a field of growing grain and
took along a rifle, hoping to see
a rabbit. He got his hope and
saw a rabbit. When lie picked
up the rabbit he saw that he also'
had kill.d a valuable oalf in
patoh of weeds Just beyond the
rabbit.
