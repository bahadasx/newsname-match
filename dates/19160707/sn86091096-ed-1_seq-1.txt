W. Huyette Suggests an Idea
Worthy of Consideration
! * Ä Mr. William Huyette has a plan
Which he is taking up with Con
gressman Charles F. Booher of
Missouri, for mobilizing the inmates
of the penitentaries throughout the
United States for military duty in
case the Mexican situation developes
into war. The plan, he says, is ori
ginal with him but since he has
written to Congressman Booher he
learned that a warden in a neighbor
ing 3 feate had suggested the idea
and had even gone so far as to get
an expression from the convicts as
to their attitude in the matter. It
is somewhat surprising to learn
that almost without exception they
were ready to volunteer their ser
vices.
Of course it is not Mr. Huyette's
idea to take the convicts indiscrimi
nately but to have a careful report
made out from the prison records
as to the character of the individual
and if his past deportment would
justify giving him the opportunity,
he would be allowed to fight for his
country and be given an honorable
discharge at the end of his term of
enlistment, providing the service he
had rendered his country might
warrant the discharge.
There is no question but that
there are thousands of criminals
within the prison walls who, if put
under military training, could fight
as well as any other men. If they
had the additional incentive of
fighting for their liberty as well as
for their country, there would be
no good reason for deserting as they
would have everything to gain by
finishing their term of service.
Probably one hundred thousand men
would be a conservative estimate
as to the number of prison recruits
who could be put into fit condition
for service—rather a fair sized
army in itself.
The first question that naturally
arises in one's mind is that of de
sertion. Everyone knows that
death is the penalty for desertion
from the army in time of war.
But even with this severe penalty,
desertion from the regular army
has been known to occur. So
that even if a few of the prison
soldiers were to desert the great
majority if given a chance to choose
between being reinstated to full
citizenship after the war or becom
ing a fugitive from justice would
unquestionably choose the former
course.
There is a disagreeable side to
the question. It has always been
considered an honor for one to be
l^v'jven an opportunity to fight for
Jr y country. To allow criminals
j distinguished service would
'y jbably arouse some ill feeling
among the regularly enlisted men,
but after all, wouldn't convicts
make just as good targets as any
other class of men? In time of
war the best physical specimens of
manhood are sent to the front first
and in case of a prolonged fight
and a costly one in regard to the
number of lives lost, these good
men are taken away from the nation
and the physically unfit are left.
Modern warfare has developed
into such an efficient method of
slaughter that men when turned in
to soldiers are looked upon as so
much necessary material for the
Machine guns to consume. A con
vict is an expense to the state that
takes care of him. He is of no
good to anyone. Why not use him
and in that way save a good man
who would otherwise have to serve
in his place.
Webster—Pircel
Miss Bertha A. Webster of Le
land and Mr. J. W. Pircel of New
ton Grove, Mont, were united in
marriage June 17. The wedding
took place at Great Falls, Mont.
Mr. Pircel was a prosperous
farmer on Potlatch ridge for a
number of years. Miss Webster is
well known in this section of the
country. They will reside on a
homestead near Newton Grove.
Sheriff and Posse Run Down
Davis and Sinead
I
Lewiston, Idaho, July 2.—James
E. Davis and George Smead, con- 1
victs, who four weeks ago escaped j
fromthe honor camp of convicts !
employed on the state highway near
Whitebird, in Idaho county, were
captured just after noou today by
Sheriff Lydon and a posse in a small 1
canyon near Arrow Junction.
Information reached the sheriff
this forenoon that two persons sup
posed to be the convicts had been
seen along the Clearwater river op
posite Arrow Junction, and within !
a few minutes, with Deputies
George Welker and John Gertje and
Thomas Tabor, he was on the way
to Spalding, where he picked up
Constable Ben Davis and took up
the search.
Just after noon Smead was dis
covered in the brush and was cover
ed by the guns of the officers before
he was aware of their presence and
surrendered without offering any
resistance. The weapons were with
Smead and Davis who was a short dis
tance off picking berries was
soon located and captured without ;
resistance. The men were brought
to Lewiston and are now occupying
cells in the county jail.
Deary Postoffice Robbed
Deary, Ida., June 30.—A robber
broke into the postoffice last night
and after breaking the combination
from the safe got away with con
siderably more than $100 in cash
and stamps, and with 25 watches
which had been placed in the safe
by Dr. Frank, who runs a jewelry
store in connection with the general
store operated by Postmaster Fred
Miller.
Deputy Sheriff J. J. Campbell
answered the call for officers which
came at 7:30 this morning, and
went at once to the scene of the
robbery. Up to a late hour this
afternoon no clue had been found.
It is thought that the robbery
occurred some time after midnight.
An effort was made to get a
j brace of bloodhounds from the
Washington state penitentiary, but
the trainer being away on his va
cation no one was found who could
handle the dogs.
;
Indians no Right to Vote
Attorney George W. Tannahill of
Lewiston is in receipt of a copy of
a decision rendered by the United
States supreme court, which deci
sion is of especial interest to the
people of Nez Perce, Lewis and
Idaho counties, holding as it does
1 that because an Indian has been al
lotted land ar.d trust patent issued
to him he does not become a citi
zen of the United States. The de
cision was rendered in a liquor-sell
ing case from South Dakota, the
scope of the decision, however, gen
erally dealing with the status of the
Indian, and Mr. Tannahill states
that the Nez Perce Indian has no
i right to vote.
LARGE CROWD AT
ATWATER LAKE
_
Celebtation a Great Success
in Every Way
Owing to the cold, wet weather
on the third of July the celebration
at Atwater lake was held only on
the Fourth. A large crowd attend
ed and the ideal weather conditions
in connection with the beautiful
surroundings made the day a very
pleasant one for those who spent
their holiday there. It was a safe
and sane place to hold a celebration
and none of the accidents that
usually occur on the Fourth hap
pened during the day.
A ballyhoo band composed of
six of the Kendrick boys played a
number of selections during the
morn ' n £ program. N. E. Ware de
livered a very interesting address,
After dinner a boat race, a tub race
,anda swimming race took place,
Don McCrea and Henry Meyers won

No Liquor Limit
Olympia, Wash.—The state su
preme court decided that it is not
illegal for a person to have in his
possession for personal use any
amount of liquor providing it was
obtained in a legal manner. The
decision, which reversed the ruling
of Superior Judge J. C. Ronald of
the King county superior court, or
ders the dismissal of charges against
William E. Boeing and John C.
Eden, Seattle millionaires, accused
of having more tnan the legal
amount of liquor in their possession,
and orders the return to them of
several thousand dollars worth of
wines and liquors seized by the
sheriff in raids on Mr. Boeing's
home and the Rainier club last win
ter.
The court ruled that the provision
of the prohibition law limiting the
amount of liquor one could have in
his possession to two quarts of whis
key or twelve quarts of beer applied
only to cases where the liquor was
kept for the purpose of sale. The
court said that it was obvious that
the framers of the law, which was
initated by the people, did not in
tend the provision to apply to per
sons whose innocence of illegal
traffic in liquor was to be presumed.
Judge Fullerton dissented from
the majority of the court, holding
that the decision virtually annulled
the prohibition law and would
make it impossible to secure con
victions of persons keeping liquor
with illegal intent.
Mrs. Kohnenberger, pastor of the
American ridge church, left for
Pine Grove, Thursday, where she
will conduct revival meetings.
Miss Alta Randall, of Texas ridge,
went to Moscow Thursday, on a
short visit.
Hf OFFICERS
DDE WELL PHD
Good Salaries Are Provided
Under New Law
—
That good salaries go with good
commissions, and those holding com- !
missions in the Second Idaho regi
ment now at Camp Morrison will
be well paid while they are on the j
border, is made quite apparent when
the salary allowance provision of
the new law, effective a short time
ago, is consulted.
Colonel Edelblute of the Second
Idaho, under the new law and from
date of mobilization, started to re
ceive a salary on a basis of $4000
per annum. Lieutenant Colonel
Philip H. Crow, appointed to sue
ceed Lieutenant Colonel McCall, re- j
ceives a salary of $3000, while the
majors of the three battalions re-,
ceive $3000 per annum. Captains j
are paid $2400, first lieutenants, I
$2000 and second lieutenants, $1700.,
All other staff officers receive the
same salaries as above according to
their rank. Every mounted officer
below the rank of major is allowed
$150 per annum for his mount.
The bandmaster or leader of the
regimental band receives $75 per
month. The first sergeants are paid
$45 per month and other sergeants
are paid $40 per month. Corporals
receive $22 per month, first class
privates receive $18, and second
class privates, $15 per month. In
addition the enlisted men are allow
ed $140 per year for clothes, which
can be purchased at cost. Com
missioned officers must furnish their
own clothes.
Both commissioned officers and
enlisted men are supplied with the
necessary regulation equipment.
They are likewise furnished their
meals and lodging, which is an item
of some consideration.
In the event either commissioned
officers or enlisted men see foreign
service, such as crossing the Mexi
can border, immediately 20 per cent
is added to their pay. The salary
payroll of the Second Idaho regi
ment runs into the thousands of
dollars per month under the new
law.—Capital News.
Quake Is Felt At Stites
Stites, Idaho, July 1.—Two dis
tinct earthquake shocks were felt
here last night. They were quite
severe in force, but no particular
damage has yet been discovered.
The shocks were felt at 11:08 and
11:00 p. m. The shocks were felt at
Clearwater and at Elk City. In
the Clearwater country a herd of
cattle was stampeded caused by the
shock frightening them.
Walked Through Glass Door
Blinded by the glare of the sun
on the canvas awning in front,
George Cheaney, a rancher of Viola,
mistook a plate glass window in
Nelson's piano store in Moscow, for
a door opening onto the sidewalk
and walked through it, breaking the
entire window into fragments. He
had been in the store for several
minutes awaiting the return of Mr.
Nelson, and his eyes became so ac
customed to the even light in the
room that they were insensitive to
the bright glare that flooded the
front part of the store. Walking
around a piano in the show window,
which is on a level with the floor,
he went through the glass. A large
crowd gathered about the store a
mazed at the result of the unusual
accident. Mr. Cheaney was only
slightly injured by the falling glass

Mrs. Tom Daugherty and son of
Fairview will visit friends in Spo
kaDe for a few days.
Snake Makes Short Circuit
A snake lying across electric light
wires 30 feet in the air caused a
short circuit and put the entire
town of Weiser in darkness Satur
day night. Workmen who found
the snake are of the opinion that it
was dropped across the wires by a
hawk. It was a large bull snake

BURGLARS BUS)
Aijspnii
Entered Two Places And An
Attempt at a Third.
Grangeville, July 3.—Two burg
laries were committed and one at
tempt at burglary was made here
last evening, ln one case the rob
ber was successful in securing $2.50
in cash while at another place he
secured some stamps. The Gerry &
Gordon pool hall was entered after
the burglar had cut a hole in the
panel of the rear door which enabled
b > m to reach in and turn the lock,
secured $2.50 from the cash
register.
The F. L. Leonard feed store was
entered and a few stamps were tak
en and an attempt was made to ent
er tbe City Bakery conducted by L.
R- Proctor. Holes had been bored
>n the front door of the bakery pre
paratory to turning the lock but
the burglar was evidently scared a
! way before he had completed his
work.
j A fire was started at the Leonard
feed store but this is beleived to
have been accidental. The alarm
was turned in about 1 o'clock but
damage to hay to the amount of
$100 was sustained before the fire
could be controlled.
The officers believe the robbery
is the work of local parties familiar
with the stores and the habits of
the nightwatchman.
Olson-Candee Wedding
has brought such a charming wife
None of the particulars of the
Olson-Candee wedding could be ob
tained for last week's issue of the
Gazette. Following is a brief ac
count of their marriage: The cere
mony was performed at Frisco,
Idaho, at the home of the bride at
12:00 A. M., Wednesday. It was a
quiet home wedding and none but
relatives were present.
After dinner was served the
bride and groom left for Wallace
where they took the 2:00 o'clock
train for Spokane. They spent
two days there and returned to
KendricKjSaturday afternoon. A big
crowd met them at the train and
they were escorted in a Ford by the
Kendrick band to the Dunkle resid
ence.
While Frank has lived in Kend
rick less than a year he already has
a host of friends. The fact that he
to Kendrick will make him even
more popular here.
Sheriff's Office On Jump
The sheriff's office has been kept
on the jump this week by criminals
operating along the line of the W.
I. & M. in the northern part of the
county. So far no trace has been
found of the thief who stole a team
from the place of Fred Veowell
near Potlatch Thursday night nor
; of the one who took a buggy and a
set of harness from the barn of
Claude Bowers of the same place, |
Friday night. The robbery of the ;
postoffice at Deary is also another
.problem with which the sheriff's
office is busy.
Finis May of Bovill spent
first of the week in Kendrick.

Splendid Program Arranged
for the Entire Day
Probably one of the largest crowds
that ever assembled at Southwick
was present at the Fourth of July
celebration. An unusually good
program was arranged for the day,
and the details were well carried
out ty the management. The lunch
stands had to replenish their stock
to feed the crowd as there were so
many more people then anyone ex
pected.
The ball game between Leland
and Southwick was a one-sided con
test from the start. Carl Carlson,
for the visitors, was in excellent
form and let the locals down with
only two hits and struck out 19
men. Southwick scored all its runs
in the seventh when a pass ball
coupled with four successive errors
netted them three runs. After this
Carlson was invincible and retired
the locals in order by strike-outs,
while his team mates continued to
pile up a lead. The final score was
11 to three.
The feature athletic event of the
day was a wrestling match between
A. O. Hartung, former heavy-mid
dle-weight champion of western
Canada, and Carl Carlson, the local
all around athlete who spent the
past year in Montana.
Carlsop, after the strenuous ex
ertion of pitching the ball game
and winning the men's free for all
100-yard dash, was hardly in fit con
dition to undertake a wrestling
match. However he succeeded in
getting the first fall in 5 minutes
and 40 seconds, by a three-quarter
nelson. Hartinger's ring experience
coupled with a skillful execution
of a series of holds and excellent
bits of wrestling law, enabled him
to down Carlson in 7 minutes and
15 seconds for the first fall.
Excitement was at its height at
the beginning of the third fall. The
crowd cheered wildly for Carlson,
the local favorite, but his worn out
condition and the superior cunning
and cleverness of his opponent made
the outcome almost evident. Hart
inger, after being floored twice,
wriggled loose and with skillful
maneuvering again downed Carlson
by the use of the toe hold and body
scissors. Hartinger was warned
frequently in the third fall for us
ing rough tactics. Time, 10 min
utes and 43 seconds.
The match was refereed by ''Big
Bill" Green, formerly prominent in
wrestling circles in the Inland Em
pire. The rules used were the Pol
ice Gazette and Greene's work was
entirely satisfactory. Another match
has been sceduled to take place
sometime before Angust 15.
The horse race was an exciting
event and was won by a close mar
gin. Bill Greene's horse took first
place and Newt Heath's second.
Wade Candler, Tom Bills and
Lloyd Kirkendahi were the princi
pals in the bucking contest. Some
splendid riding was witnessed in
this event. The purse was divided
between the three.
Pete Stump and Vester W'hitinger
won the three-legged race.
The usual bowery dance was very
well attended.—Special Correspond
