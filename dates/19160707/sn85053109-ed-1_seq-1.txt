CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY. MONTANA, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Year
Montana Is Low
In Losses by Hail
A bulletin issued by the
Montana Banking corporation
in which fair crop prospects are
reviewed, says Montana is es
pecially favored by natural
conditions, agriculturally. The
state has never had a cyclone
or tornado, and the nature of
its topography is such that it
never will; it is not infested
with vermin like rats and mice;
no poisonous reptiles to speak
of, all because of its high, dry
altitude and atmosphere. It
has none of the hazards so
'frequently affecting the farm
ing conditions in other states,
except, perhaps, hail storms,
and in the latter feature, hail
storm statistics compiled by
the United States weather
bureau for the last five years
are as follows:
Per Year
Colorado 307
Kansas 254
Iowa 232
Nebraska 219
Washington 174
Idaho -172
Wisconsin 166
Minnesota 158
Wyoming _ 156
South Dakota 154
Montana 128
It is interesting to recall that
of eleven states. Montana, with
the smallest number of hail
storms, has by far the great
est area.
Not a Note Writer
Some individual imbued
with the philosophy that what
was others' was also "his'n,"
or in less common terms, be
lieved in "the leveling and
division of property" made
away with the starting motor
and a number of smaller ac
cessories belonging to Mayor
Potter's new Velie. He also
helped himself generously to a
new kitof auto tools beiorgirg
to R. L. Taft, stored in the
Potter boathouse. The Mayor
is doing a little pussyfooting
and has given it out that if he
runs down the tellow with
queer notions about other
people's property he will
certainly not write him a note,
rather, he will resort to a certain
ancient and unwritten cave
man code.
Republicans—
A meeting of Republicans of
Cut Bank and community will
be held at the commercial club
rooms next Tuesday evening
for the purpose of organizing a
Hughes Club. Republicans of
the Cut Bank precinct are in
vited to attend this meeting
Tuesday, July 11.
Sleepless Nights
and troubled days are the portion of the man
who "takes his own insurance risk."
Is the possible saving of a few dollars worth
the worry during the crop growing season?
If your crop is hit by hail a whole year's work
will be pounded back into the earth
And to bemoan your luck and rail at Fate will
little avail. The business man takes no chance.

Thousands Throng City for Fourth
and Enjoy a Long Program of Sports
The Fourth of July celebration in Cut Bank
was an unqualified success and the guests of
the town from all parts of northern Teton and
western Toole county were highly pleased
with the entertainment program. It is esti
mated that over two thousand people witness
ed the ball game and other field sports in the
afternoon. One citizen counted over a hun
dred autos on the field.
With the exception of one injury, that of
Floyd Sullivan, w: o was thrown from his
horse when it stumbkd, aid sustained a bad
shaking up, nothing unpleasant marred the
day's festivities. The good humor and fine
holiday spirit that pervaded the crowd was
most marked.
The forenoon's program consisted of band
selections, street sports and patriotic speeches.
County Attorney John J. Greene was unable
to be present and T. J. Larson was drafted to
deliver an address. The talks delivered by
Mr. Larson and Mr. Torrison were pointed
and most appropriate to the occasion. Martin
Jacobson presided over this part of the pro
gram.
The street sports furnished genuine amuse
ment for the participants and bystanders, es
pecially the fat men's race and tug of war be
tween Browning and Cut Bank. The ball
game was not an exceptionally interesting con
test. Both teams showed ragged fringes and
loose team work. Browning captured the
game in a couple of rallies, after the fans had
decided that it would go to Cut Bank. The
bucking contest and races following the game
were intensely interesting.
A big display of fireworks and dancing in
two halls brought the celebration to a happy
close. There was little disorder and only a
couple of arrests down town for minor of
fenses.
To the Celebration Committee, H. G. Putt,
A. H. Heiland and N. Macaulay, much credit
is due for the success of the celebration. They
assumed the lion's share of the work and had
the program so well planned that there were
no hitches or delays and the entire schedule of
sporting events was carried out to the letter.
The good feeling following this successful
celebration ought to be, and will be, an asset
to the town.
Following is a list of prizewinners in the
different sporting events:
Bovs' Race, First, Maynard Strohl; Second
Albert Wilkins.
Girls' Race, First, Olive Ritchie; Second
Miss Matson.
Potato Race, First, Albert Wilkins; Second,
Earl Robnett.
Sack Race, First, Otto Hall; Second, Tom
Baze.
Ladies' Race, First, Mrs. Ferron; Second,
Mrs. McCabe.
In the tùg of war Cut Bank defeated Brown
ing. Jens Bakke was captain for Cut Bank.

H. Ohlinger.
Free for All Race, First, Percy Bowman;
Second, Wm. Wilkins.

At Electric Theatre Satur
day and Sunday
The five musical Hewetts
who played at the Grand theatre
on Tuesday and Wednesday
nights of this week certainly
gave some excellent dramas,
music and comedy. They are
high class performers and de
serve loyal support. They will
play every night to and in
cluding Saturday and it will
be worth your while to attend
their performance. All who
attended pronounced it the
best performance they had
seen in Shelby fur many
months.—Shelby Promotor.

Col. Connolly for Hughes
Col. Jack Connoly, who for
many a long year carried his
incense to the shrine of the
democratic idols and who was a
most militant and orthodox
advocate of Jeffersonianism,
is such no longer and said so in
English that none could mis
construe, in a conversation
with the Pioneer Press editor
here last Saturday. Wilson is
too shifty and timid to suit Col.
Connoly, so he will vote for a
man whom he believes will
stand "four square to every
wind." Such a man he believes
to be Charles Evans Hughes.
(Montanan)
Wm. Humble, of Bynum. was
a passenger on Wednesday's
south bound train en route to
Sunnyside Hot Springs at A1-.
hambra, where he will take
treatment for rheumatism. He
has been seriously ill for
several weeks, it being nec
essary to carry him to the
train on a stretcher. It is to
be hoped that the baths at
Sunnyside will prove beneficial
to him and that his recovery
will be speedy and permanent.
The Fourth committee desire
to extend their sine re thanks
to George Berns for the splendid
help he gave them in preparing
the ball grounds and motorcycle
track. George devoted several
days to the work and refused
compensation; a rather rare
instance of unselfishness under
similar circumstances. The
committee also wishes to thank
L. N. Robnett for the use of his
engine in the performance of
the work above mentioned.
Federal Inquiry or
Railroad Strike?
Faced by demands from the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen
t hat would impose on the country an additional burden in transportation costs of
$100,000,000 a year, the railroads propose that this wage problem be settled by
reference to an impartial Federal tribunal.
With these employes, whose efficient service is acknowledged, the railroads
have no differences that could not be considered fairly and decided justly by auch
a public body.
Railroads Urge Public Inquiry and Arbitration
The formal proposal of the railroads to the employes for the settlement of
the controversy is as follows:
"Our conference» hive demonstrated that we cannot harmonize our difference« of opinion and that eventually th«
matters in controversy must be passed upon by other and disinterested agencies. Therefore, we propose that y «if
proposals and the proposition of the railway« be disposed of by one or the other of the following methods:
I. Preferably by submission to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the only tribunal which, by reaion of its
accumulated information bearing on railway conditions and it» control of the revenue of the railway is is a posi
tion to consider and protect the rights and equities of all the interests affected, and to provide additional revenu*
necessary to meet the added cost of' operation in case your proposals are found by the Commission to be Just aad
reasonable; or, in the event the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot, under existing laws, act in the prtmitf»,
that we jointly request Congre»» to take »uch action a» may be neceoary to enable the Commission to ceasidsr IM
promptly dispose of the queatiom involved; or
t. By arbitration ia accordance with the provisions of the Federal law" (The Newlaads Act).
Leaders Refuse Offer and Take Strike Vote
Leaders of the train service brotherhoods, at the joint conference held in New
York, June 1-15, refused the offer of the railroads to submit the issue to arbitration
or Federal review, and the employes are now voting on the question whether
authority shall be given these leaders to declare a nation-wide strike.
The Interstate Commerce Commission is proposed by the railroads at the
public body to which this issue ought to be referred for these reasons:
ployes at wages; and the money to pay increased wafts
can come from ao other source than the rates paid
by the public.
No other body with »uch an intimate knowledge
of railroad conditions has such an unquestioned posi
tion in the public confidence.
The rates the railroads may charge the public for
transportation are now largely fixed l>y this Govern
ment board.
Out of every dollar received by the railroads from
the public nearly one-half i» paid directly to the em
The Interstate Commerce Commission, with its cm
trol over rates, is ia a position to make a complété
investigation and render auch deciaion aa would pro
tect the intereata of the railroad employes, the owner*
of the railroads, and the public.
A Question For the Public to Decide
The railroads feel that they have no right to grant a wage preferment of
$100,000,000 a year to these employes, now highly paid and constituting only
one-fifth of all the employes, without a clear mandate from a public tribunal that
shall determine the merits of the case after a review of all the facts.
The single issue before the country is whether this controversy is t• bt stttlfd by M
impartial Government inquiry or by industrial warfare.

Making An American
Dr. Jas. D. Gold of Browning
conducted services at the Pres
byterian church here last Sun
day evening. The theme of Dr.
Gold's address was "The Making
of An American." Dr. Gold
traced the origin and develop
ment of the Anglo Saxon race,
from which the majority of
Americans are descended, and
drew the optimistic conclusion
that out of America's Melting
Pot would evolve a mighty race;
greatest in all the world. The
discourse was listened to by an
appreciative assembly.
Dr. W. A. Hulbush arrived
Thursday morning from Havre.
The doctor has spent several
months in Chicago where he
took a post graduate course. A
number of little cities in Wis
consin present good openings
but the doctor cannot quite
"live down" Montana and its
roseate prospects and may yet
decide to resume practice in
one of the more promising
towns out here. The other
members of the Hulbush family
are residing near Fon DuLac, in
a cottage near one of the state's
beautiful lakes.
Sunday, July 9th
The famous Hawaiian Trou
badores under the management
of Thos. J. Calligan have been
secured fori one night only,
Sunday July 9th. This is
without a doubt the best
Hawaiian show on the road as
it comes highly reccomended
from the Strand Theatre,
they played
Seattle, where
continuously for three months.
It is the big musical treat of the
season.
A Bit of Advice
on Hail Insurance
wllomviul „ u 4WV
, , . f
tiie a ci > tructlon
prospect.
The Pioneer Press would
advise its rancher ' readers to
invest a little money in insur
ance against hail; furthermore,
it would advise them to do it
at an early date. This advice
is not given at the behest of an
insurance company, local or
foreign. It is a word of honest
and what we consider timely
advise. Use your own diu
cretion about the company,
but by all means put on a little
insurance, is our word of coun
sel. The crop is growing with
remarkable rapidity and a hail
storm at any time from now
on would cause much damage.
Last year the "hail season"
opened early and we had a
number of teasers and a few
storms that did considerable
damage. This year, in many
characteristics, if such a term
may be applied to seasons, is
much like last year, many
thunder showers and sudden
hot spells, sure generators of
hail storms. The arguments
for insurance are legion (any of
the local agents can overwhelm
you with them) and they are
sound. Much worry during
the next month or two will be
averted by having your crop
insured. We hope none of
you will have occasion to
collect it, but if you do it will
be considerable recompense for
fine crop
