"HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY."
OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1916
MAY NAME C. B. KE6LEY
ON FARM LOAN BOARD
Master of Washington State Grange
Likely Candidate for New
Offlce.
Reports from Washington, D. C.,
are to the effect that C. B. Kegley,
master of the Washington State
Grange, has excellent chances of
being appointed a member at $lO,-
000 a year of the farm-loan board
created under the rural credits law
passed last week.
It is asserted that the state
granges of 25 states, in addition to
the Washington Grange, have en
dorsed him for the appointment.
| During the past fortnight the admin
istration has caused inquiry to be
made regarding his fitness for the
i position. He is now at the national
capital.
Mr. Kegley has been master of
the Washington State Grange for 10
years and has taken a leading part
in farm organization work. When
the agitation for rural credit legisla
tion was started he was appointed
chairman of the national conference
on rural credits and was also elected
president of the Rural Credit League
of America- He is a brother of T. J.
Kegley of this city.
Initiative Preambles illegal.
Preambles to the initiative bills
filed by the Joint legislative commit
tee, proposing a new fish code and a
first aid law, are illegal because they
contain arguments they should not,
the state supreme court said in a de
cision given Wednesday, reversing
one previously given by Judge Wright
of the local superior court. "There
is no need or place" for the declara
tions of purpose, the court says,
which it declares properly belong in
the initiative pamphlet, inasmuch as
tbey are purely arguments in sup
port of the bills. The court there
fore grants an injunction preventing
the circulation of the bills for signa
tures, but says the proponents of the
measures may expunge the objection
able features from the measures.

PRICE FIVE CENTS
WORK FOR TIRE FACTORY.
Local Men Anxious to Get New Half-
Million Dollar Industry for City.
An industry which will employ 200
men at an average payroll of approx
imately {I,OOO a day and will add, it
is estimated, some 1,000 persons to
the city's population, will be located
in Olympia this summer if the indus
trial bureau of the Chamber of Com
merce and the trustees of the organ
ization are successful in carrying out
the plans upon which they are now
working.
The firm in question is the Stan

president. Various conferences have
been had with W. W. Wiswell, repre
senting the company, and the local

MEXICAN SITUMION
NOW MORE SETTLED
CARRANZA SEND CONCILIATORY
NOTE TO WILSON, ASKING
NEGOTIATIONS.
With a satisfactory and concilia
tory answer received from President
Carranza and all immediate likeli
hood of war with his government re
moved, early resumption of friendly
diplomatic conversations with the de
facto government of Mexico to the
end that peace and order may be re
stored in Northern Mexico and along
the border Is expected to be the next
step of the United States in its rela
tions with Its southern neighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M., and culmi
nating in the light at Carrixal, Mex
ico, between American and Mexican
troops, now appears to have been dis
sipated by the note from General Car
ranza, presented Wednesday, which
proposes thq£, the differences between
tlpe governments be settled by media
tion or by direct negotiations.
Note Very Friendly.
It is remarkable for its brevity, Its
restrained and friendly tone and for
the absolute lack of any of the strong,
even Insolent, language which char
acterised the last two communica
tions from the de facto government.
It treats as a closed incident the ex
change of unfriendly communications
which brought war almost within
sight.
As a matter of general principle,
the Washington government always
has favored mediation of any dispute
suitable for such procedure. There
is every indication, however, that in
the present instance it will be deem
ed desirable to conduct negotiations
directly with the Carranza govern
ment
May Withdraw Troops.
President Wilson also has made it
clear time and again that gradual
withdrawal of the expeditionary force
would be ordered, once he was assur
ed that Carranza forces would be em
ployed actively in breaking up bandit
preparations for new raids.
The mobilization of the guard at
the border continues at full speed,
Washington's regiment leaving for
Texas Wednesday. It is certain there
will be no Immediate alterations In
the war department's plans. Proba
bly a reduction of the border forces
would be ordered only after some co
operative plan of action had been
agreed upon with the Mexican gov
ernment, and had been tried out suf
ficiently to leave no doubt as to Its
practicability.

WHOLE NUMBER 2915
KUSAH STARTS SUIT
AGAINST M'GORKLE
ONE OF THREE INJURED IN CUT
TING SCRAPE ASKS $3,U00
DAMAGES.
Charging gross carelessness and
official negligence and claiming that
his right arm and hand are paralyzed
so that he is permanently injured,.
Fred Kusah, one of the inmates of."
the county jail at the time that an
other prisoner, Ernest Reisch, "ran
amuck," has brought suit against
Sheriff Fred W. McCorkle, the Fidel
ity Bonding & Trust company, and.
Reisch, for $6,000 damages.
No papers in the case have been
filed at the county clerk's office and
Sheriff McCorkle is uncommunicatlvo,
though he did not deny that the pa
pers had been served on him. This
service was made Wednesday by
Wright & Wright, Seattle attorneys
retained by Kusah. The papers need
not be filed for 20 days.
The suit is the outcome of the cut
ting scrape in the county jail early
on the morning of May 11, when
Reisch, who had been picked up near
Shelton in a demented condition and
had been confined in the local jail
May 8, became crazed with the idea
that the other prisoners intended to
harm him and assaulted them with a
heavy knife he carried in his pocket.
That afternoon he was committed to
the Stellacoom asylum, where he to
still confined* He has a brother lir
ing near Kamilche, with whom be
had been making his home.
As the result of this cutting scrape,
prisoners by the names of William
Thompson, J. W. Miller and Fred
Kusah, had to be taken to St. Peter's
hospital for medical treatment, and
Thompson Is still at that lastttuttra.
He and Kusah were the worst Injured
of the three, though the latter was
able to leave the hospital In a few
days-
Aa the story vu told at the time;
Thompson was the first man attacked
by Relsch and Kusah the one who
grappled with the insane man and,
with Miller's help, downed him and
took the knife away from him. Ku
sah, In hi* suit, claims he was stab
bed a half a dosen time In the left
shoulder and in the hollow of his
right arm just above the elbow, that
the nerves and muscles in his am
were severed, and that his arm is
paralyzed below the elbow so that he
is unable to use it or his hands and
fingers.
Since the serving of the papers In
the Kusah case, it has been reliably
reported that Thompson, through his
attorney, E. N. Steele of this city,
would also bring suit against Sheriff
McCorkle and his bondsmen, and tt
is expected that this action will be In
stituted within the next few days.
Whether Miller Intends to bring any
such action is not known.
Kusah, shortly after his return
from the hospital, was tried on a
charge of stealing belting from a Te
nino mill,, but the jury disagreed
and he was released and went to Se
attle. The trial of Miller on the
charge of stealing logs from the Rob
inson tract at Hogum bay also ended
in a disagreement and the charge
against him was dismissed last week.
Thompson is held on a charge of
stealing brass from local concerns.
Reisch's mind had been affect
ed ever since he was a boy when,
while working as an apprentice to m
shoemaker in the "old country," hl»
employer hit him on the head with a
shoemaker's maul. Reisch had mada
his home with his brother for six or
eight years, and was found in Mason
county early in May, wandering
around. After being confined to the-
Mason county Jail over night, he was
brought to Olympia and turned over
to the city police, who turned him.
over to the county authorities ths>
next day.
Sheriff McCorkle wu absent from
the city that day and Retsch was tak
en In charge by Deputy Sheriff Jack
Glfford. who failed to search him.
He was confined In the bull pen occu
pied bv the other prisoners and Kara
no signs of dementia the three day*
he wad confined to the Jail prior to
Tuesday morning, May 11, when the
cutting scrape occurred.
He Is made a party to Kusah's
suit, as Is also the Fidelity Bonding
& Trust company, which furnished
MrCorkle's bond of $3,000 indemni
fying ttap county from any liability.
