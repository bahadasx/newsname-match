MISS ALICE NIELSEN
The Celebrated Hop rnno Old Sot Ap
pear Last Evening on Account of a
Sever Case of Laryngitis
Which She Ce.nl rafted at
Xcala, Ohio.
Mlaa Alice Nielsen, the celebrated so
prano, who was to appear last even
ing and give her recital was unable to
do so on account of a very severe case
of laryngitis which she contracted In
Xenla, Ohio. Miss Nielsen appeared
on the stage to tell the audience of
how sorry she was not to be able to
sing and she could scarcely speak
above a whisper. It seems as If she
waa seated under an electric fan in
the Ohio city, and the draft from It
gave her a cold which developed Into
laryngitis. She will be unable to sing
for the next week as her throat Is In I
serious condition.
The Redpath people do not do things
by halves. They have arranged for
Miss Nielsen to return at a later date
and give her recital, which will
be about the first of Septem
ber and all who were present last
evening were given tickets that will be
good on her return trip. Mr. McKwan,
the superintendent, said that if need he
the tent would bo brought back, and
everything made up to the people.
In a personal interview wltli UN
Editor of the Public Ledger last even
ing Miss Alice Nielsen said she n
very much chagrined over being tin
able to sing here last night and stated.
I will he hark In September to sing to
the Mil) It Hie people If I am alhe."
Miss Nielsen being one of the great
est sopranos in the wold, is a most
pleasant and charming woman and is
accompanied on all of her trips by her
private secretary, Mrs. W. E. Stickle,
who Is also a most entertaining wo
man.. It is to be regretted that Miss Nielsen
could not fill her engagement here, as
an elaborate program had been pre
pared, with all encores to have Ml SB
of old familiar songs, many of which
you hear her voice in the Columbia
Records for which company she sings
exclusively.
Maysvllle will be delighted to wel
come Miss Nielsen on her return in
September and she can rest assured
the people will give her a hearty re
ception. One of the best musical pro
grams ever held In this city was given
in the place of Miss Nielsen. Her ac
companying artists, Mr. Kirk-Smith
.-ind Mr. Reddick gave a phort recital
on the cello and the piano. Their
music was wonderful. Mr. Kirk-Smith
on rtie cello being a star performer on
that instrument.
The afternoon lecturer, Thomas
Brooks Fletcher, gave an excellent ad
dress. Mr. Brooks waa met by a small
audience. Dr. Fletcher Is not a
stranger to Maysvllle people as he
appeared several years ago on the ly
ceum platform. He is earnest, elo
queut, dignified and dramatic and is
acknowledged as one the leading lec
turers on the Lyceum platform.
The tent crew left this morning for
Athens, Ohio, where they will be for
the next few days. Mr. McEwan made
quite a number of friends during his
stay in this city and he will be wel
comed back next year If the Bureau
should see fit to send him.

"The Square Deal Man"
I
Washington, July 6 The de facto
government of eMxIco was Informally
notified tonight through Ellseo Arren
dondo, Ambassador Designate, that the
United Statea welcomed Oeneral Car
mnza'a proposal to adjust all pending
differences between the two govern
ments by direct diplomatic negotia
tion. Mr. Arrendondo was informed of the
American government's nttltude In a
conversation today with Secretary
Lansing after the latter had conferred
with President Wllsoa. Iater a for
mal note will confirm the Ambassa
dor's report. Mr. tanslng virtually
had completed a draft of the commun
ication tonight but it may be read to
the cabinet tomorrow before it Is de
livered. Immediately after the cabinet meet
ing Secretary Lansing plans to leave
for a month'a vacation. Counacllor
I oik will administer the affairs of the
State Department in his absence and
meet Mr. Arrendondo in the Informal
discussions at which a solution of the
Mexican problems will be sought.
It was evident at. the State Depart
ment today that officials believe an op
portunity now has been presented out
of which may come a means of giving
the de facto government material and
in restoring order throughout Mexico.
It is known that the pacific nature of
the Mexican note, which brought the
crisis between the governments to an
end, is construed here as indicating
that Oeneral Carranza, besides being
impressed by American military pre
parations, has been deeply Influenced
by the presure and argument brought
to bear on him by friends In the nit
ed States, hv European diplomats In
Mexico City and particularly by rep
resentatives of many of the aLlin
American powers. The latter have ex
erted themselves to the utmost to
avert war and to foster In tiMwral
Carrunza's mind the idea of I'an
American unity.

D. HECHINGER & CO.
The directors of the Ohio State
League met last night In Portsmouth
to discuss plans for the second half
of the season. They held an all-night
session and nothing could be learned
of the meeting at press time this
morning, further than the fact that the
season would be finished.
Talk is going the rounds that the
league is about to blow up. There
may be two of the clubs drop out of
the league but there are others wait
lug a chance to get in the league.
Frankfort and Charleston are picked
to drop but they do, Zanesville, Chill!
cothe and Irontou are anxious to se
cure a berth in the league and the
space will be tilled. Tho Lexington
club will stick and the Portsmouth
team is sure of staying. Maysvllle is
somewhat doubtful but Huntington is
assured for the rest of the season
Frankfort and Charleston are not in
as bad a tlx as they are figured by the
knockers.
SOME RECORD
During the four-game series here
with Huntington the Burley Cuba
made total of m hits and C5 runs or
an average of 164 hita and 13 3-4
runs u game. This la a record for the
league and will probably not be du
plicated In any other league this sea
aon. The twenty-three runs made in
the last game on July 4 was also the
leiigne's record for the season.
