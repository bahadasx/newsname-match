Washington, July 7.-Tlie note de

that received Tueaday from Foreign

"Sirs I have the honor to acknowl

III LiEIICI I
ance before the cabinet were:
First, what is to be . done about
guarding the border and permitting
Carranxa to establish a parallel patrol
In cantonments on his side of the
uns.
Second, what to do about aenatng
militiamen on the border to their
homes with the Incidental increase In
the regular army to fill their places.
Third, and basically most import
ant, what to do to place Mexico on
a firm footing among the nations.
; With respect to the latter, the ad
ministration feele that It cannot at
present encourage hankers to extend
aid in Mexico. But It is hopeful Car-
canza can now take a strong' gutd
ing band which will insurs a stable
government ultimately and thus af
ford the opportunity for American
financial aid.'
One hundred million dollars, ac
cording to a high government of
ficial," would be the salvation of the
stricken nation, If It could be ob
tained upon other than confiscatory
terms. The great tear is, however,
that "loan sharks' may demand Mex-
! Icq as their collateral a proposi
tion which Carransa would heartily
reject and which the Wilson admin
tstratlon will not support
To encourage Carransa In estab
lishing his government and to work
out a scheme ot financial assistance
which will not-extort blood money
from Mexico, was the big admlnlstra

The governor declined to give a
line on what he . will speak about,
though stating that the "main pur
pose ot the conference is to maintain :
progressive principles ot government '
in California and nationally."
It la considered probable that Johnr
son will during the course ot his ,
speech make known whether he will
run for United States senator. He
! also expected td speak on national
affairs. It Is said by persons close
to the governor that he will not ac
tively . campaign for Candidate .
Hughes, though he has selected
Hushes as his personal choice. ' '
It would not be surprising It the
governor should at the conference la-
dlcate his choice or lieutenant-
