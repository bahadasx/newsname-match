CALOMEL DYNAMITES
A SLUGGISH LIVER
Crashes into Sour Bile, mak
ing you sick and you
lose a day's
work
Calomel salivates I It's mercury
Calomel acts like dynanite on a
Bluggish liver. When calomel
comes into contact with sour bile
it crashes into it, causing cramp
ing and nausea.
If you feel bilious, headachy,
constipated and all knocked out
just go to your druggist and get
a 50ct., bottlo of Dodson's Liver
Tone, which is a harmless vege
table substitute for dangerous
calomel. Take a spoonful and if
it does'nt start your liver and
straighten you up quicker nnd
better than nasty calomel and
without making you sick, you
just go and get your money.
If yon take calomel today
you'll be sick and nauseated to
morrow; besides, it may salivate
you, while II you taKe avouson-s
Liv9r Tono you will wake up
feeling great, full of ambition,
and ready for work or play. It's
harmless, pleasant and safe to
givo to children; they like it,
