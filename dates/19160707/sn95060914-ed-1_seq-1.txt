HaydenSays New Plan Will Not
Interfere with Receipts from
National Forests
Washington D C July 7
Congress has passed a compre
hensive bill granting federal aid
to the states for the construction
of highways that means much
for the future development of
Arizona In his remarks on the
good roads bill Hon Carl Hay I i
den made a detailed explanation i
of the terms of the Act as it af 1
fects Arizona Mr Hayden said 1
Mr Speaker I desire to take J
this opportunity to briefly state
i
just what benefit the State of
Arizona will receive by reason of I I
the passage of the good roads
bill This measure first appro
priates 5 000 000 for the fiscal
year beginning July 1 191G i I
10000000 for 1917 15000000
for 1918 20000000 for 19191
and 25000000 for 1920 which
sums are to be expended by the
Secretary of Agriculuture co-
operating with the State high 1
way departments in the con
struction of rural roads over
which United States mails are or
may hereafter be transported
In order to obtain the benefits of
this act a state must by act of
the legislature assent to its terms
It is also required that a state
highway department be estab
lished with which the Federal
Government can deal and the
State must also contribute at
least art equal amount in money
materials or labor toward the
construction of any proposed
road Arizona is ready to meet
these conditions and will make
good use of her share of the ap
propriations
The money appropriated by
this actwill be apportioned among
the states according to three
factors One third in the ratio
which the area of the state bears
to the total area of all the states
one third according to population
and one third according to the
mileage of rural delivery and
star routes compared with the
total mileage of such routes
Arizona has of the total in the
Union 383 per cent of the area
0224 per cent of the population
and 0251 per cent of the postal
route mileage By consolidating
these three factors we find that
my State is entitled to 1435 per
cent of the appropriations made
under this act which means that
be apportioned for road
tion in Arizona at the beginning
of each of the next fiscal years
1916 71000
1917 143000
1918 215000
1919 287000

is therefore reasonable to assume
tho fnllnwinr sums nfmnnov will that my State will receive the
iU ouow Arizona or a total of 1000000
In other words 1074000 will within the next 10 years I
be contributed from the federal traveled by automobile through
treasury to assist in building most of the national forests in
highways in Arizona during the Arizona last summer and I can
ensuing five years j testify that this money is sorely
But this is not all the benefit needed
that Arizona will receive by the The friends of Federal aid for
enactment of this legislation for the construction of highways
section 8 of this bill appropriates have been willing to vote for al
1000000 each year for the next most any kind of good roads bill
10 years to be expended under because we knew that when a
the supervision of the Secretary system of congressional appro
of Agriculture upon the request priations for this worthy object
of the State or county authorities
in the construction and mainte
nance of roads within or partly
within the national forests The
States or the counties in which
the forest reserves are located
are required to enter into coopera
tive agreements with the Depart
ment of Agriculture to pay for
the roads that they want built
upon a basis equitable both to
them and to the United States
The Federal Government is to be
reimbursed for the money thus
advanced by depositing in the
Treasury 10 per cent of the rev
enues received from the timber
or forage resources of the forests
wherein the roads are located
until the loan is paid
I may add that this new plan
in no way interferes with the
present system whereby the
States and counties are now re
ceiving for road and school pur
poses 25 per cent of the gross re
ceipts of the national forests

forests in the United States is

withheld There is not a shadow
of doubt therefore but that
Congress will continue to appro
priate at least 25000000 an
nually after 1920 to aid the States
in the construction of roads This
makes it certain that under the
first apportionment provided for
in this bill Arizona will receive
not less than 2850000 during
the next 10 years With the in
creasing appreciation of the value
of good roads Congress is more
likely to augment rather than to
reduce this amount By adding
to this sum the 1000000 that
my State will receive during the
next decade from the special ap
propriation which this bill makes
for forest reserve roads it is safe
to say that Arizona will receive
Federal aid to the extent of at
least 3850000 during the next
10 years With this help from
Uncle Sam Arizona can build a
system of main highways and
branch roads that will be a credit

CAR HATCHS NOTE
VERY COURTEOUS
Proposes That Both Govern
ments Settle Differences
by Mediation
TROOPS HAY BE WITHDRAWN
From Mexico and Both Coun
tries Will Join to Protect
the Border
Early resumption of friendly
diplomatic relations with the de
facto government of Mexico to
the end that peace and order
may be restored in Northern
Mexico and along the border is
expected to be the next step of
the United States in its relations
with its southern neighbor
The crisis precipitated by Villas
raid on Columbus N M and
culminating in the fight at Car
rizal Mexico between American
and Mexican troops appeared to
have been dissipated by an amic
able note from General flairnnvo
presented Wednesday by his am-
oassuuor uesignate Hiiiseo
dondo
The note proposes that the dif
ferences between the two govern
ments be settled by mediation or
by direct negotiations It is re
markable for its brevity its re
strained and friendly tone and
for the absolute lack of any of
the strong even insolent lan
guage which characterized the
last two communications from
the de facto government It
treats as a closed incident the
exchange of unfriendly com
munications which brought war
almost within sight
No formal comment on the
note was given out by state de
partment officials A copy was
forwarded to the White House
immediately on its receipt and
Present Wilson will determine
on tne course to be pursued
The fact that Secretary Lansing
has completed preparations for a
nionths vacation to begin today
is regarded as significant how
ever of a feeling on his part
that the crisis is over
As a matter of general principle
the Washington government al
ways has favored mediation of
any dispute suitable for such pro
cedure There is every indica
tion however that in the present
instance it will be deemed desir
able to conduct forthcoming
negotiations directly with the
Carranza government
Probably the preliminary steps
necessary for the inauguration of
the informal discussion will be
taken then State department
officials appeared entirely satis
fied with the definition of the
matters to be settled outlined in
the new Mexican note It is
presented in this language as
translated at the embassy
The American government
believes reasonably that the in
surity of its frontier is a source
of difficulty and the Mexican
government on its part believes
that the stay of American troops
on Mexican territory aside from
being a trepass on the sover
eignity of Mexico is the immedi
ate cause of the conflicts There
fore the withdrawal of American
troops on the one hand and the
protection of the frontier on the
other are the two essential prob
lems the solution of which must
be the Qirecting object of the ef
forts of both governments
Coupled with this definition is
an outline of a sort of military
status quo beyond the border
which the de facto government
suggests as a substitute for its
previous demands for immediate
withdrawal of the American
troops
