BOARDNOT
CITED FOR
CONTEMPT
"The commissioners of Grady coun
ty never were cited for ontempt and
tliero isn't any danger of their going
to Jail whether they put in culverts out
at Taluer or not," was the comment
of Judge Will Linn of the district
court at noon today, in commenting
upon a story that appeared In a met
ropolitan paper this morning.
After an agreement had been reach
ed a year ago between commissioners
and people of Tabler, to put in cul
verts, following a petition for an in
junction . the commissioners did not
put thctil in. They were merely cited
to appear .before the court .and show
yvhy the culverts were not put. in.
They did it. The, reason given was
that they didn't have the funds.
"And that is all there was to it,"
Judge Linn said.
Commenting on the mutter one of
the commissioners said: . ,.
"The reason we did not build the
culverts was that we did not have the
funds to build them with. All road
work was a topped last October except
the grading of the Verden road, which
was done chiefly by subscription. The
county commissioners are working un
der the state highway laws and no one
else is attending to Grady county road
matters."

IVuuhiiicton, D. C, July 7.- How
many able bodied citizens of tuilir&ry
ii;c have we In the United States?
The bureau of census, while it in
unable to make any estimate of tho
proportion who aro able-bodied, esti
mates that the total number of male
citizens unil prospective citizens -that
is, foreign born persons who have de
cliired their intention to become citi
zens 18 to 43 years of age, incluarte,
is not far from 2 1 ,OuO,oni,
This estimate is based on the aa
sumption that there has been an in
crease of approximately 10 pes? cent in
the populat ion of the country since tlm
census of 1010. When that census wa i
taken tho total number o mala citi
zens and prospective citizens IS year,
of ago and over but under 4G was 1!.
18:1,000. Of this number, lUII.i'O-l
were native whites, 2,857.000 were foreign-born
whites who hud become nat
uralized or had declared their intcn.
tion of doing so. 2, 01. '..',000 were ne
groes, uud 'On, WM were Indiana. , The
number of foreimi-boni citizens is par
tially an cHtiuiale, -fiiuee the eeuuu J
enumerators were able to obtain-information
as to citizenship from on!.
about seven-eighths of the total num
ber of I'oreiguborn mules. Native
whites thus repieiieut about U per
cent of the total, foreign-born white
nearly 13 per- cent, negroes nearly lb
per cent, and Indians t bout ' three
tenths of I per cent.
During the Civil war, when the pop
ulation of the country, exclusive of Ui
seceding states, was less than ono
fottrtU as great as the present popula
tion of the. entire United States, tb'
lot 1 number of men servlnK in thu

The following table gives, by states.
