Mint ttmmvum" f tawe
r t r
Leader of Brooklyn Dodgers
There always has been an Impres
sion that Wllbert Robinson was an
easy boss and that as such his men
will play on him with the result that
the athletes shirk their duty to the
detriment of Brooklyn's pennant Inter
ests. Any number of fans can be
found who will declare In favor of a
taskmaster like McGraw and against a
suave manager like Robby. They hold
the opinion that ball players must be
driven slavelike If a club Is to be a
winner. Kid-gloving them gets noth
ing In the end but the horse laugh.
Becent events have proved, however,
Oat Robby Is less solicitous of the
feelings of his men than In other
years, writes Len Wooster In the
Brooklyn Times. While he still ap
plies the salve and Is ever ready to
bestow praise for a clever piece of
work ho is driving his team harder

SCORING IS BLAMED
Pittsburgh Writers Criticize St.
Louis Official.
Think Pitcher Babe Adams Should
Have Credit for No-Hit Game
Corps of League Scorers Would
8olve Problem.
Official scoring in the baseball world
Is again causing trouble. It started
right here in St. LouIb when Pitts
burgh writers criticized the work of
the local official at the Cardinal park
for not giving Babe Adams a no-hit
game. One dinky hit, that many
thought was an error by Schultz, was
the sole black mark against the Pirate
hurler, writes Ed Wray In St. Louis
Post-Dispatch.
The present system is truly faulty.
Scorers are appointed by home clubs.
They are invariably working newspa
per men. Sometimes, as in this city,
the same man Is not on duty in all
games, but the Job is "split," repre
sentatives of several papers taking
turns at the task.
Thus several individualities may en
ter into the scoring in the same town.
Pittsburgh writers suggest that the
league select a paper, without permit
ting anyone to know which one it is,
and take its box scores from that pub
lication. It is argued that the scorers
would then each give his own ver
sion, without waiting for the official
on it.
But this would only confuse fans
who want one ruling on plays and that
an official one. And they are entitled
to it
The obvious course, if the scoring Is
not satisfactory, is to take it out of the
scribes' hands and establish a corps of
league scorers, each to bo assigned to
certain series, Just as are the league
umpires.
There is absolutely no reason why
this should not be done now, even al
lowing for the expense.

"During the first few days only
dogs and cats were struck, and one
could hear their howls and cries a

human victim was a young Belgian
who had heard King Albert's call and
wanted to go through Holland to Join

"Clara Vermel was the young wom
an's name. She was an inhabitant of
Oostkerke. In the beginning of the
war her husband had been called to
the colors. She heard from him
three times, then his letters ceased,
and for months she had lived alone,
hoping that her husband was still
alive.
Face Death for Husband.
"One day Clara Vermel was brood
ing over her misfortunes when the
door opened and In walked 'Limping
victor,' a cripple who was employed
by the Germans to do errands, and
had often to go to Holland.
"'Clara,' he said, 'I have seen Rob
ert. He is at Sluis, Just over the bor
der. But don't ask any more. I risk
too much already.'
"She heard the door bang and was
again alone. Robert alive! Robert
at Sluis, only a few miles away? Then
she fell on her knees before the Holy
Virgin In the corner and prayed.
"Then a shadow crept over her
face. Sluis is in Holland! The elec
tric cables! They meant death for
those who came near them.
"But she would go. She would face
death for him. Her father tried to
dissuade her, but finally gave in.
" 'There Is only one man, Clara,' he
said, 'who can help you If you really
want to go to Sluis, and that man is
Plor, the poacher. He knows every
inch of soil for miles round and miles
into Holland. Let us go and see htm,
or rather you go alone; that would be
safer. You know where he lives.'
'"So you want to get to Sluis to
see your husband, who was a sol
dier?' said Flor, when Clara called at
his hut. 'But do you know what it
means, young woman? Do you know
how many have been killed by that
devilish wire?
Crawls Through Tunnel.
"It was about midnight when the
poacher and Clara left the hut.
'"This is the time that the guard
is changed, and those old landsturms
are always late,' he had said, caution
ing her not to make any noise.
"Near the little River Mendel run
ning half a mile distant the poacher
knew a kind of tunnel. This tunnel
had been made many years ago to de
liver water to a factory, standing Just
across the border, near Sluis.
" 'The cable Is only a few yards dis
tant from us,' whispered the poacher
to Clara. 'We must keep to the
right, as we will soon turn with the
path and leave the cable. A cat
rushed past. Clara was frightened.
A few seconds after the poacher
stopped her. 'Listen; that cat has
been killed,' and she heard the 'com
plaining cry' which always followed
contact with the wire by man or ani
mal. "The poacher had now found the
bridge he was looking for. 'Now
about a hundred yards further,' he
said. He searched the grass and the
rushes near the water until his foot
sunk deep into a hole. Soon he found
the opening. 'Come,' he said.
'The tunnel was not high enough
to stand in, so they had to crawl.
Clara thought it would never come to
an end. She had never been in such
darkness. She banged her head, hurt
her feet, but thought only of her hus
band. At last she beard the poacher
say: 'Here we are! This is Holland.
But be quiet tor another hour, for I
want to go back. You follow this lit
tle river about five minutes. You will
then come on a road which will bring
you Into Sluis after twenty minutes'
walk. And your soldier will be sleep
