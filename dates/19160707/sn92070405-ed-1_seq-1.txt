BATTLE GOES TO A DRAW
Kid George, the fighting demon
from Central, and Jack Thomas,
thfe battling ghost from San Fran
cisco, staged a ten round fight un
der the management of Doc Alston
Monday night at the Star theater,
before an enthusiastic but com
paratively small crowd of fight
fans. The battle was declared a
draw by referee Gammon.
The big smoke from Frisco was
one of the most powerful speci
mens of brawn and muscle ever en
tering a Ting in this city. He
gave George a hard run and only
in the last round did the white man
put over some genuine tell-tale
blows. Clinching was predomin
ant 'at all times for which the
fans sent up a howl. Kid George
did some good blocking, but his
blows did not phase Thomas in the
least, the big huskie smiling off
the jabs.
Thebout could easily have last
ed ten rounds more as both men
were on their feet, smiling and
ready to fight to a finish.
The preliminaries were very
good. Kid Pete of Lordsburg and
a stranger from Phoenix mixed it
hard for three good rounds. They
made use of every minute and
gave the fans some real excite
ment. The local Kid Tracy and a fight
er by the name of Tiacy from Sil
ver City worked out four rounds
of clever boxing in which the local
boy showed some speed. Tracy has
the makings of a good little fight
er. Two youngsters fought three
rounds while George and Thomas
werereparing'for their entrance.
Nat Gammon refereed the fight
to the satisfaction of all,

F. V. Bush of the Western
Liberal will leave Saturday for
Los Angeles and San Francisco,
California, for a two weeks'
business and medical trip to re
ceive treatment for an injured
Vertebra sustained several years
ago in a mine accident. During
his absence Clifford C. Blood of
Silver City will be in charge of
the Liberal. Jess Palmer will be
on deck in the mechanical de
partment as usual.
Mr. Blood has been a resident
of Grant county for several years
and is well known in this section.
He was until recently a member
of the faculty of the New Mexico
Normal school and has done con
siderable journalistic work for
newspapers and periodicals in
New Mexico. For several years
he has been editor of the "Nor
malite," the Silver City Normal
publication.
During Mr. Bush's absence the
people of Lordsburg will find Mr.

Engineer Struck By Crane
W. A. Linder, a well known
engineer on the Southern Pacific,
was struck by a mail crane at
Carne, N. M. below Deming,
Sunday evening while bringing
in a troop train. Mr. Linder's
skull was fractured and injuries
are such that little hope is held
for his recovery. On the troop
train at the time was a New
Haven and Hartford locomotive
engineer who brought the train
on in to Deming. Wild rumors
were published Wednesday that
Mr. Linder had been shot by
Mexican snipers.
WOMAN CAPTURED
IN PARKER MURDER
SherrifT Herbert J. McGrath
received a telegram this morning
from under-sheriff Schrimpser of
Hachita stating that the Mexican
woman, who with her husband
disappeared from the Parker
ranch after the murder of Willi
am farker and his wite. had
been caught by the southern
Grant county posse in, Mexico.
The woman refused-to talk or
give any information. Her hus
band is still at large. This is
one of the most important finds
since the dastardly murder anil
may result in the truth being
earned.
Late beliefs from southern
Grant county are that Mr. Parker
and wife were murdered by the
Mexican who was employed at
lis ranch. Onlv two horses and
saddles were missing from the
place and these the couple are
believed to have taken. The
man and woman were trailed by
the posse into Mexico and it's like-
y that their capture will cast a
ight on the murder.
Later: Mr. Schrimpser arrived
Here this atternoon with the
womau en route to the county
jail. It is alleged that the wom
an told the officers that the mur
der was committed by her hus
band "for meanness." She was
apprehended while riding one of
the Parker horses and saddles
across the border.
The woman will have a hearing
before Judge C.W.Marsalis here
July 15th.
Fourth of July Accidents
Boyd Wallace, the young son of
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Wallace was
badly burned Tuesday when a
package of fire crackers was ig
nited in his pockets and exploded
The boy was burned about the

was also burned about the hands
and arms while extinguishing the
blaze from the youngster.

TROOP TRAINS HERE
The early part of this week

militiamen from Massachusetts,
Connecticut. Rhode Island and
other states to the border passed
thru here stopping for water
and ice. The boys had a great
time here and proceeded to buy

startling thing the militiamen

the high cost of living in the

over it.

to the effect that the Foster-Day
Cattle Co. had been awarded $20,-
000 damages in their suit against
the Highland Cattle Company for
tho recovery of n forfeit sum for
the purchase of the Lazy R outfit

COUNCIL HAS
SEVERAL PROBLEMS
One of the most imnortant
questions confronting the new
city council has been the town
lighting problem. At the reciucst
of several members of the council
the Lordsburg Power Company
has submmited furures for their
approval and which may be taken
into consideration whenever the
council sees fit to take up the
question of street lighting. Fig
ures have been received from
Demincr and El Pasn nn thn
question which the towndads will
go over and compare with the
local proposal.
The Lordsburg Power Com
pany presented the council in
writing a nronosition of install
ing and maintaining a street
lighting system for a period of
not less than ten years on the
basis ot 50 lights at the following
rates: price per year for each
light, 32 candle power, $19.65
moonlight schedule or $23.80 for
all night service. 40 c. p, $21.80
moonlight schedule or $?7.00' for
all night. 60 c. p. $24.00 moon
light or $30.00 all night service.
The company also presented a
vernal proposal to furnish
electricity with no contract on'6
meter charge providing the city
installed their own lighting
system or to release the city from
any contracts on the rate sub
mitted in writing provided a
lower price should ever be given
by any parties, the said parties to
re-imburse the power company
for the actual cost of installation
of the lighting system. Council
man Olney has made inves
tigations of town lighting in El
Paso and other places and all
this data is to be placed before
the council whenever they take
up the proposition.
The Liberal is informed that,
despite rumors to the contrary,
the Lordsburg Power Company
has paid the tax imposed by the
council which went into effect the
first of the month. The matter of
taking the quarter section in
which the power plant is situated
into the corporate limits of this
city will doubtless soon come up
before the council.
MOVE INTO HACHITA
Paguo and Robertson, Tom and
George Winkler, and families, Tom
Upshow and several other families
from the Playas Valley have mov
ed into Hachita nwaiting a moro
stable Mexican situation. Sev
eral families fiom Walnut Wells
have also moved into town.
