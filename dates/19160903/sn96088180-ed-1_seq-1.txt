Jeotion was made to consideration of
th, house measure In place of the
longer .ml imore comprehensive bill
prepared by the senate Interstate com-
merco committee.
Senator 8hafroth opened the de
bate today by moving to change Sen
ator Underwood's Amendment so that
K would be specifically stated no em
ploy affected by the bill would be
compelled by It terms to work, that
stopping of work would not consti
tute "delaying or obstructing opera
tion of trains," for which the emend-
ment provides a fine of IS.000 or one
year's Imprisonment.
"Suppose," said Senator Ilardwick,
"the railroad presidents came to us
snd said 'legislate us Increased
freight and passenger rates, or we
will stop operating all trains in this
country!' What would we do? We
would not be permitted to be co
erced."
"Why don't you republicans stop
criticising and offer something ' to
avert this strike?" quered Hustlng,
Wisconsin, ,'x
"I think we all agree on the main
question, our chief Interest Is to avert
this Impending calamity. So we sltall
do It In the only possible way 'by leg
islation."
Senator Sherman, Illinois, bitterly
denounced "Rushing the bill Into leg
islation ,ln'a few hours, when there
should l days of deliberation."
"We re doing this under threat,"
Sherman Mild.
To prove his point, Sherman read
several telegrams from large labor!
unions of the middle west, pleading
with him to urge passage of the eight-
hour law bill and to oppose any form
of compulsory arbitration.
"I would rather he a dog and bay
at the moon," Sherman said, "than
be a senator enslaved by such dic
tations and threats. These messages
show the. way the wind blows by de
manding that I urge government own
ership of railroads."
"The poor bookkeeper In Chicago
gets tho true sense of this whole sit
uation, when he wants me to vote
against It. He says If congress
passes this bill. It will bare to keen
on, with other poor bookkeepers, pay-
Ing the price."

The democratic party, the presi

"We believe the energy and Initia

as we have set them free." and not

"Th,'day of little Americanism,

Outllnlng the legislative record of
his party, the president said the
democrats have virtually created
commercial credit for the farmer, had
"given a veritable emancipation" to
the working man, had released the
children of the country from "hurt
ful labor," and, in addition to many
other things, had put through na
tional defense legislation greater
than ever "seriously proposed tfpon

"I neither seek the favor nor fear

Hlgglns. 1
Railroad circles this afternoon ac
cepted as certain the calling off of
the strike. -.
"The railroads, however, will con
tinue their preparations against a
strike. It Is not np to ns whether

Activity, With FrdgHt SL
certs bcreasha Rapidly
About the buaiest place in tha
northwest these days is the station ot
Waters Creek, the present terminal
of the California 4b Oregon Coast rail
road. With the scores of teams and
auto trucks hauling ore, lumber, cord
wood and logs for shipment, there Is
almost a congestion of traffle about
the stat. n every day, and the scene
Is one of life and activity and the
whirl of Industry.
Ever since the road was" first put"
into regular operation by the firm of
Twohy Brothers company, who took
it over from the city of Grants' Pass
a' year ago, the business has been
continually increasing until during
August tne reora shows that 138
carload shipments were made from
the Waters Creek terminal, or, from
stations along the 15-mile line.
Of this total of 188 carloads, 33
were of ore that had been hauled by
team and truck from the mines at
Waldo and other Illinois x valley
points. Of lumber there were 34
carloads; of cord wood, 21, and rf '
logs an even 60. .
Copper and Iron Ores - v ' ;
The Queen of Bronxe and Waldo
copper mines supplied the ore for 14
carloads during the month, 19 car
loads of oftromlo Iron ore being also
included in the shipments. The cop
per ore was all Wiled to Tacoma,
where it is smelted. The ore cars
carry from 44 to E5 tons each. v
The shipment t the chromic irorf
ore is a new industry, made possible,
by the demand created for the nrod-
uct through the shutting off of Euro
pean supplies by the war. Two com
panies, the Manganese comnanv nt
California and the American Refrac
tories company of Danville, Illinois.
are the shippers.- The first named
company makes Its shipments to
Montreal. New York. Bessemer and
Duquesne, while the American Re
fractories company sends Its ore to
Danville. Both companies are hast- -ening
the production ot ore as rapid
ly as possible, as there is a most ac
tive demand among eastern manu
facturers at present. Much of the
chromic iron Is found in the Oregon
mountain district, and Is hauled SO
miles by team oefore It Is loaded up- "j
on the cars. The copper ore is mil '
mined at Takilma, which will be the
terminal ot the next unit of the new
railroad to be constructed. Only the
best of the ore is brought to Waters
Creek, and thousands of tons of the
lower grades are being placed upon
the dump at the mines tor shipment
as soon as the railroad Is constructed
that far. This alone will increase the
traffic of the line many fold with the
laying of the rails into the Illinois
valley, which Is expected to be before
another season. 1
Sawmills Are Busy
Three sawmills are now sending
their cut to Waters Creek for ship
ment by rail into Grants Pass, the
three being Schmltt Bros., Jpaulding
