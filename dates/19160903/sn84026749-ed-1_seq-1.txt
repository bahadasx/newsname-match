ZEPPELINS PUI
TO ROUT AFTER
LONDON RAID
British Capital Raked by
Bombs From Greatest Air
Fleet of War.
ONE DIRIGIBLE IS WRECKED
Falls in Mass of Flames in
Suburbs of London No De
tails tin Killed.
LONDON, Sept. 3. British anti
aircraft guns routed half a score
of Zeppelins after a thrilling night
duel in the greatest air raid ever
made.
While it is known that the heart
of London was raked by the bombs
dropped from the aerial raiders, no
details of the actual losses or the
number killed or wounded have yet
passed the censor.
For the first time in history, one
of the giant Zeppelins was' shot
down inside the limits of the capi
tal According to the official an
nouncement, a greater number of
airships participated in the raid
than in any hitherto perpetrated.
A Zeppelin was shot down in
the suburbs of London, bursting
into flames as it fell.
BEATEN OFF FROM LONDON.
The attack was beaten off In the vicin
ity of London, bu It Is thought serious
damage may havo been done in some of
tha eastern counties. Many bombs are
reported to have been dropped'ln widely
separated localities.
The Zeppelin brought down last night
Is the second to meet disaster In at
tempted attacks on London this year.
On March 31 last the L-15 was dnmaged
In a raid, and camo down in the Thames
estuary. Seventeen of the crew were
captured.
The total number of Zeppelins lost by
the Germans in the war Is uncertain, but
It probably aggregates thirty, according
to the war office.
Raid Announced by Germans.
Because of tho largo number of Zeppe
lins engaged, it is believed the attack
was the first of a scries of great raids
which the Germans announced several
weeks ago had been planned to strike
terror to London during the months of
September and October. Wether any of
the new 780-foot 8UDer-2epPoIlns took
part in the attack Is not known at this
hour.
The sky forces were favored by Ideal
weather In their lourney across the
Channel. Ihey were met with a lively
fire from anti-aircraft guns, howover,
and, were picked up by searchlights as
soon as they arrived above London. Tho
destruction of one of the raiding Zeppe
lins proved conclusively tho Improve
ment In the air defenses of London since
the .cppclin raids of a year ago.
The official statement said that the
raid on London was "beaten off." Gen
eral French characterized the attack on
London as "the biggest ever made."
The Zeppelin destroyed was brought
down from a great height aflame, plung
ing earthward like a great comet.
The Zeppelins appeared off the east
coast at about 11 p. m. It was their evi
dent purpose to Inflict great damage on
London and the eastern counties.
Anti-aircraft guns Immediately en
gaged the German air forces, but sev
eral Zeppelins succeeded In making their
way over London.
Last Great Raid on
London Made Year Ago
The last great Zeppelin raids on Lon
don were made about a year ago. On
the night of September T, 1915, Zeppelins
raided the Xstom counties of England
and the city of London, killing seven
teen persons and wounding thirty-nine.
The following night In a great raid that
carried one of the dirigibles over the
Bank of London, twenty persons were
klled and eighty-six wounded by explo
slves and Incendiary bombs. On Octo
ber 13, the Zeppelins again visited Lon
don and the eastern counties, killing
fifty-five persons and wounding 11 tho
most destructive raid on the London
territory.
On March 31, 1916, Zeppelins raided
London and the east and northeast
coasts of Kngland. killing forty-three
persons and wounding sixty-six. In this
raid the Zeppelin L-15 wns shot down off
the mouth of the Thames and Its crew
captured.
Since thla last raid Zeppelins havo
reached the outskirts of London soveral
times, but on no occasion did their visit
result In severo loss of life. For several
weeks dispatches from Berlin havo tore-t
cast great raids on London by fleets of
new super-Zeppelin monsters. Ameil
cans returning from Berlin reported
that the German air commanders plan
ned to lay London In asnes In a great
attack with Incendiary and explosive
bombs. Meanwhile London aviation au
thorities went ahead with 'jw plans for
the defense of the city from new at
tacks from tho air.
The 'Zeppelin brought down In last
night's raid Is the first actual shot
down on English soil, the L-15 having
fallen off the mouth of the Thames. It
Is the thirty-sixth Zeppelin destroyed
by the allies since the beginning of tho
war, according ,o British offcal statements.

"The situation speaks for Itself,"
said W. S. Stone, president of tho en

Were Sent Out in Code

t
"Fre. .Here h, Delayed" "Your House Is Burning

to Brotherhood Chairmen.
Code mesaages calling off the strike
were sent out by the four brotherhood
leaders at 8:45 last night.
No two of the more than 600 dis
patches were alike. One of them read:
"It Is reported that a big fire Is rag
ing In Toronto." Another said; "There
1,4 danger of your house burning
down tomorrow."
"Will meet you at eight." was a
third, and "Fire here. Delayed." a
fourth read. All meant the same
Lven the brotherhood heads did not
know what all the messages con
tained, the composition of them hav
ing been left to clerks.
It was not until these messages
were placed upon tho wire' that the
menace of a nation-wide striko was
removed. Until the hour, when the
messages went forth It was not de
cided whether the strike should he
called off by the brotherhood chiefs
'upon passage of the bill by both
houses or until It had become law by
the President's signature.
After some discussion the four
brotherhood chiefs, Qarretson, Stone,
Carter, and Lee, decided to act in ad
vance of actual signing of the bill.
They feared some of the railroad
men would be out on-runs and difficult
to reuch If they waited until today,
Jess than twenty-four hours In .ad-v
vance of the hour set for the general
strike.
Senate Accepted House Bill.
The eight-hour bill passed by the
Senate was the same bill that passed
the House Friday night. In order to
avoid delay and prevent sending tho
bill to conference the Senate substi
tuted the Adamson House bill for the
Newlands Senate bill.
The bill passed tha Senate shortly
after 8 o'clock laat night, aftier a day
of oratory, by the vote of 43 to 28.
The bill was- taken to the House Im
mediately and Speaker Clark signed
it at 0:08. It waa returned to the
Senate Where Ranator ninrkn nt At.
kanaas, president pro tern of the Pen-
nie, signed the bill In the absence of
Vice Prealdent Marshall.
All the four brotherhood lenders
were outside tho Senate chamber
when tho vote waa taken on the
eight-hour bill.
When advised of the signing of the
bill by presiding officers of both
Houses they returned to the National
Hotel to discuss the question of call
ing off tho strike.
Secretary of Labor Wilson went In
to conferenae with the brotherhood
leaders after the Senate had acted.
It waa presumed he brought pressure
to bear on them to send out the code
strike cancellation order last night,
rather than to wait until the bill was
signed by the President today.
It was first planned to send the bill
by special messenger to Shadow Lawn
for the President's slgnaturo last
night, but the Attorney General de
cided there was no legal prohibition
nguinst signing the bill on Sunday.
Bill in Plain Language.
Stripped of tta legal verbiage the
bill passed by the Senate and House
to avert the threatened railroad strike
Is as follows:
Beginning New Year day eight hours
shall constitute a working day for
all employes engaged in operation of
trains on Interstate railroads. Th
pay is to remain at the present dav
rate. All "necessary" overtime work
shall be paid for at the same rate per
hour. Klectric street and Interurban
roads and roads independently owned
as well as roads not exceeding 100
miles In length are exempted.
The President Is directed to ap
point a commission of three men, at
salaries he is to decide upon, to in
vestigate tha financial and economic
results of the operation of the law.
This Investigation is to be completed
within six to nlno months. Within
thirty da"a after completion of the
investigation report Is to be made to
Congress. Twenty-five thousand dol
lars Is appropriated for expenses of
the commission.
Any one violating the act Is sub
ject to a fine of not less than tlOO
nor more than 81,000, or not more
than one vfnr's imprisonment, or
both.
Satisfied With Bill.
The brotherhood leaders wore perfect
ly satisfied to have the bill signed on
Sunday.
"I have always considered the Sab
bath one of the best days of the week,"
A. B. Qarretson, spokesman for the
brothcrhod leaders, said, when asked
his opinion of tho Sunday signing. "1
can see no reason why Sunday should
make any difference."
"Are you asolutely satisfied with the
bill as passed?" ho waa asked.
"I have heard In my lifetime of only
one man who was asolutely satlslled,"
Oarretson replied, "and he's dead."
Oarretson refused to discuss the ques
tion of the constitutionality of tho
measure. It was suggested that the bill
might bo interpreted as constituting a
confiscation of property without due
process of law as provided by the Con
stitution. "It doesn't begin to be the confisca
tion that It is when a rallropd president
gets his pay raised," Garrotson coun
tered. Asked about the legality of legislation
by Congress regulating wages. Garret
son retorted:
"I don't know whether Congress can
pass a wage law, hut It has. It reminds
mo of the man who couldn't be put In
Jail, but was there."
Garrctson plans soon to begin a year's
vacation, which he was voted by his or
ganization recently on account of his
health. He will take a sea trip.'

STRIKE
MEASURE LAW AT
9:11 O'CLOCK
Four Gold Pens Used Will Hi
Given to the Railroad Broth
erhoods. PRESIDENT OFF FOR SOUTH
On Way to Kentucky to Accept
Lincoln's Birthplace Rail
roads to Attack Act.
Seated in the drawing-room of
his private car, the Federal, at
Union Station, President Wilson at
9:11 a. m. today, signed the rail
road eight-hour bill, which was
rushed through Congress in the
last forty-eight hours in a desper
ate and successful effort to avert
the threatened railroad strike.
At 7:10 the train bearing the
President, with Mrs. Wilson and
other members of his party, had
pulled into Union Station from
Shadow Lawn, N. J., where yes-,
terday Mr. Wilson formally had
(accepted the nomination of jlie
Democratic party for another four
years' service in the White House.
At 10:30 o'clock his train pulled
out again, this time for Hodgen
ville, Ky., where tomorrow he will
accept on behalf of the Govern
ment the humble birthplace home
of Abraham Lincoln.
FOUft PENS USED.
In the interval between his arrival
and departure, the President preferred
to sign the measure at the station.
rather than go to the White House.
Four pens one for each syllable of
his full name were used In afflxlnr the
signature, and one of these pens will
go to each of the heads of the four
great railroad brotherhoods.
The "no striko" order already kas
gone forth from the brotherhood lead
ers to each of the G40 district chairmen
of the unions. Under a promise fiom
tho President that he would not let the
fact of Sunday Intcrofere with hie sign
ing tho eight-hour bill today, tho heads
of the brotherhoods agreed not to
await the actual signing of the measure
beforo calling off what promised to b
ono of the most disastrous Industrial
upheavals in the history of the coun
try. The promise was conveyed to them by
Secretary of Labor Wilson, who con
ferred bver the long-distance telephone
last riht with President Wilson before
the l4ter left Shadow Lawn
Embargoes Also Lifted.
Along with the "no strike" ordr
havo gone forth telegrams from the
main offices of the railroad systems
cancelling the freight embargoes which
had been placed last week, when the
prospect of a strike appeard inevitable.
Automatically this served to lift the
gateways that had been shut down on
the flow of the country's commerce,
and business men nnd manufacturers
throughout the United States heaved a
mighty sigh of relief.
Automatically, too, the excuse was
lifted for the famine prices which the
markets of the country had begun to
establish In anticipation of a food short
age. With the main features of the strike
legislation out of the way the provision
decreasing the eight-hour day for ten
hours' pay, and the provision creating
u commission to report on Its opera
tion Congieestonal leaders have no
thought of enacting Into law the re
mainder of the President's program.
These two provisions made Into law
what the brotherhood leaders had ac
cepted out of President's Wilson pro
posals to them as mediator.
Tho remainder of the President's pro
gram called for legislation to enable the
railroads to meet the added burden
of cost. This part Is to wait until Con
gress reconvenes In December.
The first part was sufficient to In
duce the brotherhoods to call off the
strike; and Congress plans now to clean
up and adjourn by Wednesday or
Thursday.
Arrangement Merely Temporary.
But though dissipated for the present,
the striko clouds aro not altogether
removed from tho horizon.
The arrangement at present Is mere
ly temporary, though sufficient. In all
probability, to tide the situation over
election date. . ,
On the one hand the railroad com
panies are preparing to attack the
constitutionality of tho law In the
courts, On tho other there exists the
possibility that the commission to be
created under the new law may con
vince Congress that the eight-hour
day may not operate permanently In
practice without removing the stip
ulation requiring the ten-hour stan
dard of pay, or without an Increase
In freight rates.
Asked for Industrial Peace.
And yet, standing out as one ot the
principal features of the President'
speech of acceptance at Shadow Lawm
yesterday was his earnest plea for in
dustrial peace, and for co-ordination
