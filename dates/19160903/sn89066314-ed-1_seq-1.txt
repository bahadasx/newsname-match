LONG BEACH. N. J., Sept. 2.
President Wilson spoke for his re
nomination today. Before an immense
crowd that pressed over the beauti
ful grounds of Shadow Lawn, the
President accepted his re-nomination
at the hands of the Democratic party,
outlined the achievements of his ad
ministration and scored the Republi
cans as "a party of masterly inactivi
ty, standing pat to resist change."
The Democratic party, the Presi
dent said, holds to very definite
ideals.
"We believe that the energy and in
itiate of our people should be set
free as we have set them free and not
concentrated in the hands of a few
powerful guardians as our opponents
have again and again sought to con
centrate them," the President said.
"The day of little Americanlsmj
with its narrow horizon, wnen noi
beds of 'protection' and industrial
nursing were the chief studies or our
provincial statesmen, is past and
gone."
The people, the President said,
would not reject those who have mu
tually served them for those who are
making doubtful and conjectural
promises of service.
Outlining the legislative record of
his 'party, the President said that the
Democrats have virtually created com
mercial credit for the farmer, had
given a veritable emancipation to the
workingmen, had released the chil
dren of the country from "hurtful la
bor" and, in addition to many other
things, had put through national de
fense legislation greater than any
ever seriously proposed upon the re
sponsibility of an entire political
party.
"And," he concluded in his discus
sion, "we have come very near to
carrying out the platform of the Pro
gressive party as well as our own.
for we, also, are progressive."
"I neither seek the favor nor fear
the displeasure of that small alien
clement amongst us which puts loyal
ty to any foreign power before loyal
ty to the United States," he said.
The President advanced his Mexi
can policy as an issue upon which he
would stand in the face of any criti
cism. While admitting the possibill
ty of a mistake " in this perplexing
business," he flayed those who would
have recognized the "unspeakable
Huerta."

LONG BEACH, N. J., Sept 2. A

President Wilson's re-election in No
vember, Senator Ollie N. James of
Kentucky assured the President in
formally notifying him of his nomi
nation by the Democratic convention
this afternoon.
James enumerated some of the ac
complishments of the Wilson admin
istration. The federal reserve act, he
said, freed the country from the
money gang, destroying at the same
time the money trust and the panic
trust.
