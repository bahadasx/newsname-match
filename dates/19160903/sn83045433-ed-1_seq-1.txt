HUGHES ATTACKS
WILSON'S WAY OF
AVERTING STRIKE
"Never Surrender Principle to
Arbitrary Force," Says
G. 0. P. Leader.
(3y the Iateratlenal News Sersiee.)
St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 2.-"Never sur
render principle to force," said Charles
E. Hughes in a speech here this after
noon, which is interpreted generally to
night as being a criticism of the means
by which President Wilson averted the
threatened railroad strike.
Mr. Hughes has declined repeatedly to
discuss the strike situation, and he re
peated his declination today both before
and after his address was delivered.
There is particular significance, how
ever, in the fact that in his speech this
afternoon the Republican candidate used
language almost identical to that which
was used by friends of Mr. Hughes who
have discussed the strike situation with
him.
The speech was made before :.00 liai
ness men at the Missouri Athletic As
sociation. He had been talking of the
itticulties of the past-economic and in
dustrial.
"We have come to a time in this coun
try," Jhe declared. "where we need not
surgery. but hygiene. We have, as I say,
demonstrated our capacity to maintain
the public rights. Now we must demon
strate our capacity to inset the economic
difficulties which surely confront ts.
"Never Surrender Principle."
"Hlow shall these difficulties be met?
In the first place they will not be met
unless in every relation we maintain
the supremacy of reason and justice and
never surrender principle to force.
"I believe the American public is fair.
I think that we desire always to take
counsel together with respect to what is
lust. The day has gone by when any
thing arbitrary should be me'tained in
this land. 1 like the expression which I.
frequently used in the decision of the
courts, that under our institutions there
is to place upon the part of any ofilier
or on the part of any board or on the
part of the combination for the exercise
of arbitrary power.
"Our cormunity is organize'l with full
confidence that the judgment exprme.edl
through the machinery we have afforded)
for the expression of pubic opin!on is a
sound nod goo judgment In t ' rtain. on
which we tmay feel secure in relying.
"I believe slt we need in this country
in any difficulty is to focus the attention
of the American people on the facts, Let
as understand what the facts require.
Then let us do what these facts require,
and the American people from the Atlan
tic to the-Pacific are willing to accept the
decision.
"Do Nothing Arbitrary."
"Rut let us do nothing arbitrary and
never dethrone reason, which must rule
supreme in a democracy, or else democ
racy becomes a failure."
When attention was called to the fact
that these expressions might be Inter
preted as bearing up the settlement of
the railroad strike, it was said Mr.
Mughes had no statement to make.
Mr. Hughes tonight laid claim to prece
dence over President Wilson in fathering
child labnr legislation. He criticised the
recent Democratic measure as not going
far enough. t claimed that mist of the
liberal legislation recently enacted by
Congress he had adgtated as governor
of Near York.
"There is nothing 1 desire so much as
the betterment of humen life." he ue

Shadow Lawn, Long Branch. N. J., Sept

icnt Woodrow Wilson was officially noti
led this afternrx.. of bis renomination as

Enthusiasm ran riot during the cere
nonies at the summer White House.
Senator Jame., chairman of the notiflca

h. thousands who witnessed the cere
nonies, when he tendered the letter of
utloticatlon to the President.
President Wilson, in his address, made
is first attack on Charles E. Hughes.
harging that he was making "doubtful

Also he predicted a ncw place among
torld powers for the United States and
leclared this nation could never remain
eutral in the next big war. To prevent
ear, he advocated establishment of a
eague for enforcing peace.
The President said the Democratic

uhlicans had promised to enact but had
1eglected.
lie made a bid for support of the Pro
ressives by asserting that "we have in
our years come very near to carryine
ut the platform of the Progressive party
ts well as our own; for we also are pro-I
ressives."
Turning in his speech to the interna
ional standm of the United States, the
President upheld his Mexican Polley and
its policy toward European tations.
"I do not doubt that the people of
:he Uited States will wish the Demo
ratie party to contimue in control of
the government," he said. They are
not in the habit of rejeeting those
who have aetnai 7 served them for
those who are making doubtful and
'onjeetural promises of serviee. Least
,f all are they likely to subastitute
(hose who promised to render them
particular service and proved false
to that promise for those who have
actually rendered those very services.
"Boasting is always an empty bus,
less, which pleases nobody bur the
oaster, and I have no disposition to
