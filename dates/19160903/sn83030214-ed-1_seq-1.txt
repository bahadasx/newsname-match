To-day I heard the unending rattle and roar of the machine
guna that are defeating Germany; but there were no bullets ap
parent and no casualties. It was the sound of the pneumatic
riveting hammors. ringing upon a hundred ships in the torest
like yards of the Clyde. The scene from the deck of our launch
as we glided from dock to dock and from reaeh to gleaming
reach of the smoke-wreathed river was one of epie grandeur.
And here, too. I was strangely reminded of the boyhood of
Drake, when he was taken by his father to live on that disused
hulk rotting in Chatham Reach to dream hi.- dreams and grow
up in a grim nurscry. among ropes and masts and cannon.
And all around them, aa he heard
The elavg and elatter of thipwright hammefi rano.

new ships arising and saw my old instindive expenence there
before me, like a reeollection of a former existence. I could
not help wondering whether more thoughts were "in the air
