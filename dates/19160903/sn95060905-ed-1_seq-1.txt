night. Military men said that the organiza

department, but that the work could
quickly be resumed if tbe rforthward
movement ended.

plans for dispatching from the border

centrated so it can gain adequate
practice.

ARIZONAN SEEKS DAM
AGES FOR ALLEGED
E
PHOENIX. Sept. .2. For having
been battered and crushed in tbe
mine of tbe Arizona Hercules Copper j
company and for having been fed
poisoned coffee in the course of a
treatment for his injuries. Peter Zells,
yesterday filed suit for damages
against tbe copper company In the
sum of 150,000. But after his attorney j
had filed the suit Zells wag not sure
that he wanted to go about having his
wrongs righted that way and inquired
if it was not possible to have the
action withdrawn. '
The Injuries complained of were
sustained by the plaintiff in July of I
this year and for them alone $25,000
is demanded. Having made a pay
ment of $1 a month he secured rights i
In the hospital of tbe company and
he was taken there to recuperate after
his injury. It was then that the poison
ed coffee was administered to him
but it was not charged that the poison
was mixed with the coffee maliciously.
There is on inference that It was in
troduced Inadvertently. Still the ef
fect of it upon his system was the
same.

ARIZONAN GETS PATENT
ON NEW IRRIGATION
DITCH DEVICE
PHOENIX, Sept. 2. Letters patent
No. 1,194,951 have been Issued to D.
H. Burtis. of Phoenix, for a new Irri
gating device, a sectional ditch lining
of concrete, so devised and construct
ed as to be a perfect carrier of water
from a lateral across a field for de
livery to the various lands. For head
ditch purposes an open ditch has many
advantages over the pipe asll practi
cal Irrigators know. The Burtis pat
ent ditch is carefully constructed, may
be easily Installed and sells at a
reasonable figure, so no doubt will
find a good market In the southwest.
Especially for "burro" ditch purposes
this ditch will fill a great want and
will wherever Installed do away al
most completeyl with tbe useless
;sa and wastage of water that goes
1th tbe ordinary dirt ditch, as well
to make the work of ditch cleaning
Jmost a thing of the past, together
vith a minimum of weeds. Mr. Burtis
'ias a few sample sections of ditch
?et up in his shop window at 15 East
Washington, or it may be seen at
be factory of the Cement Pipe com
pany on East Jackson. The sides and
bottom of the ditch are made in short
sections, easily set together, and ad
ustable gates may be placed in the
sides, at no extra cost wherever they
are desired.
