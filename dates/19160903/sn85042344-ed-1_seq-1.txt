flpcl1 to The. World.
OKLAHOMA CITY. Sept. 2. -Increase
of 2 per cent In freight
and piiHHetiKer rates will be allowed
Immediately the bill providing for
the eight-hour law for railroad train
men passed In congress today If
nigned by President Wilson, by the
Oklahoma eorporation commission to
railroads doing business In the state.
This Information was authorized this
evening, though no formal statement
was made. This offer Is prepared
to meet any demand that might be
made by the railroads.
One of the members of the cor
poration commission has been In
vestigating what might be the prob
able added cost to the railroads In
the event they adopted the eight
hour law as embraced In the bill
passed by congress, and he estimated
that an Increase of 2 per cent would
cover such added cost. When It be
came apparent here today that the
bill would undoubtedly become a law
before many hours the commission
prepared to make the offer men
tioned. Wnl Not nrrak Itoads.
Figures prepared In the offices of
the commission here show that the
added Increase In cost of operating
tralns under the new eight-hour law
would not amount to more than
$45,000,000 over the entire country,
while the railroads contend It will
amount to $100,000,000. On the
basis worked out by the Oklahoma
commission It Is estimated that an
Increase of 2 per cent In Oklahoma
on freight and passenger rates would
cover this state's portion of the
added expense.
What effect this offer of the com
mission will have on the litigation
of the freight and passenger rates
In Oklahoma which has cost the
state thousands of dollars already,
and which Is now undergoing the
final process of securing a court de
cision, is not known. Just how much
the 2 per cent would Increase the
passenger rate has not been figured
out. I'nder the circumstances It Is
to be presumed that there will be no
difficulty In an agreement of what
the rate should be, either passenger
or freight.
Lmbargocsi Lifted.
Another feature of the strike sit
uation here this afternoon was thn
lifting of embargoes by all the roads
which had previously announced that
freight shipments would not be ac
cepted. The Fort Smith West
ern and the Rock Island were the
only two roads In the state that had
not placed embargoes on freight. All
roads anticipating - that the eontro
versy would bo settled by the passage
or ine diii announced they would
proceed with the acceptance of
freight shipments, and preparations
were mane to no so.
It ts believed the offer of the com
mission announced here today Is the
first of such action to be made by
any commission or tribunal In the
t'nited States. The action may have
the effect of preventing the railroads
making a demand for a larger In
crease In rates, which may Involve
anotner trim or the freight and pas
senger rate problem.

CHICAGO, Sept, 2. Accepting
passage of the Adamson bill by
the senate tonight as complete assur
ance that the threatened railway
strike peril had passed, heads of
western railroad announced they
would take no precipitate court ac
tlrn against the Adan.son law, but
would wait until tlio measuro had
been thoroughly investigated.
At the same time railway execu.
lives declared that the perltd of time

that the senate had passed the bill.
Hale Holdcn, president of the Chi

the railways would not discommode
the public by any precipitate action.
Will Walt Awhile,
"It Is niy belief," he Bald, "that we
will wait for I he government Investi
gation provided by the bill before tak.
ing any action against It.
"The cost to the railroads of the
threatened striae has already run
voty high. We have been under ex
traordinary expense. The lose to the
public can not bo estl nated at this
time, hut shippers and travelers have
suffered Inconvenience and monetary
lofs. I understand that the western
parks hove been practically deserted
ns a result of the strike threat and
that many resort hotels have closed
down."
Mr. Holden declared the present
legislation bv congress n direct result
of previous bills which had rr.ndo la
bor exempt from the Sherman anti
trust act.
The railroads, according to the offi
cers of the general managers' assocl
tlon here, are practicably unanimous
in taking the view that no court ac
tion will be taken against the Adam
non act without thorough Investiga
tion. Apparnt passages of the strike
peril came at a tune when railway
bunds were ready for a tert, they de
clared. Many railroad managers said
they had been assured that a large
percentage of their trainmen would
not go out In event a strike was called.
The brotherhood heads had denied
this.
Although passage of the bill by the

there would bo no strike, manv of the

Tho cessation of 'riffle is Indefin

Idea of tho Import of the action. Nrmo
of the other f ads has followed.
The order to stop trains Is thought
to have been made reveral days ago
by the railroad as a precaution against
loss from tho strike. The optimistic
aspect put -on the situation by passage
of the Adamson bill yesterday led
local officials to believe that the plan
would he abandoned nnd they waited
late Into the night for some advice
from headquarters.
The stopping of trains is In direct
contrast to other actions of tho Frisco
and other local roads yesterday. Dur
ing the course of the day all lines
leading Into Tulsa lifted their embar

Traffic resumed Its normal trend.
It also reached the ears of local of

On the other hand Sheriff Woolley
continued his arrangements yesterday
to guard the property of the railroads
In Tulsa with deputy sheriffs. Four

The stopping of trains Is regarded
as a final precaution taken tiy the
conservative Frisco railroad. In case
of a strike the railroad will thus save
damages for delays to passengers and
freight.
All freight houses of the city will be
closed Monday. Officials say that
this has no bearing upon the strike
situation as it Is a yearly custom to
close on Labor day. Carload freight
will le received. No advice has been
