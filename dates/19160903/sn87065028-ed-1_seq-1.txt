HIGH LIGHT OF PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
"So nation ran any longer remain neutral as againut any wil
ful disturbance of the world."
"The nation of the world must unite in joint guarantee that
whatever it dona to disturb the whole world' I if must be tested in
the rourt of the whole world's opinion before it is attempted.
"The immediate future, will bring us squarely fare to fare
with many great and exacting problem which will search us
through and through whether we be able and ready to play the part
in the world that we mean to play. It will not bring us into their
presence slowly, gently, with ceremorious introduction, but sud
denly and at once, the moment the war in Europe ia over."
"The nation that violates (America's) essential rights must
expert to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and
resistance."
"I neither seek the favor nor fear the displeasure of that small
alien element amongst us which puts loyalty to any foreign power
before loyalty to the United States."
"Some of the leaders of the (Mexican) revolution may often
have been mistaken and violent and selfish, but the revolution itself
was inevitable and is right."
"So long as the power of recognition rests with me the govern
ment of the United States will refuse to extend the hand of wel
come to anyone who obtains power in e. sister republic by treachery
and violence."
"The future is not a future to be afraid of. It is, rather, a fu
ture to stimulate and excite us to the display of the best powers
that are in us."
"The republican party is just the party that cannot meet the
new conditions of a new age. It does not know the way and it does
not wish new conditions."
"We have in four years come very near to carrying out the
platform of the progressive party as well as our own; for we are
progressives."
"Alike in the domestic field and in the wide field of the com
merce of the world, American business life and industry have been
set free to move as they never moved before."
"The republican party was put out of power because of failure,
practical failure and normal failure; because it had served special
interests and not the country at large."
"I do not doubt that Jhe people of the United States will wish
the de moratk party to continue in control of the government. They
are not in the habit of rejecing those who huve actually served them
for those who ate making doubtful und conjectural promises of
service."

SERIOUS SITUATION IS FACED
BY COTTON SEED OIL MILLS
SMALL CROP Y MAKE IT M
POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL PLANTS
TO OPERATE.
The shortness of the cotton crop
in this section is causing local cotton
seed oil mills to face a rather serious
situation, and a season of practical
idleness appears to be in store for
them. i
There were at one time three cotton
seed mills in Columbus, but the nor-j
mal crop of 30,000 bales, which was
the average for this county before the
boll weevil appeared, proved too small
to keep all them in seed, and one plant
has not been in operation for three
years. The two remaining pjants
have managed to keep in more or less ;
continous operation throughout the :
winter months, but with the prospec
tive yield cut to 5,000 bales for the
coming season they can hardly hope
to secure sufficient seed to pay them
to start their machinery In motion.
The manager of one plant said that
no conference hud been held and that
no plans for the approaching winter
had been made.
AWARD HIGHWAY CONTRACT
LINK COMPLETING JACKSON
HIGHWAY IN THAT COUNTY
IS PROVIDED FOR.
At a joint meeting of trje board of

sioners of Lamar county, Ala., which
was held at Vernon, Ala., Friday it
was decided to advertise at once for

which will complete the route of the
proposed Jackson Highway through
Lamar county. - j
Citizens of Lamar county were at,
variance regarding two proposed
routes, but at a meeting held at Ver
non several weeks ago their differ
ences were amicably adjudicated, and
the awarding of the contract followed
this adjudication.

the executive committee of the Jack

Total Yield Estimated at 11,

The crop reporting board of the
United States department of agricul
ture on Thursday issued a statement
showing the condition of the cotton
crop on August 25 to have been 61.2
and the market immediately respon
ded to the bullish nature of the esti
mate, having advanced from 57 to
62, which is tantamount to some
thing like J3.00 a bale. The esti
mate indicates a total yield of 11,
800,000, exclusive of linters.
Oa Friday a reaction followed.
Thursday's advance, and the market
weakened considerably, a net decline
of from 27 to 33 points having taken
place during the session. This de
cline, however is believed by many
well posted brokers to be only tempo
ary. When the market is high fluctu
ations are always frequent, and the
next few days may even carry prices
beyond the high levels of Thursday.
No quotations were sent out yes

A summary af the r-nort fol
lows: "Augit was unfavorable for cot
ton in almoHt alt sections of the cot
ton belt. In the western section, the
crops deteriorated severely in Okla
homa and Texas because of extreme
drouth over large areas, which caused
the plant to stop fruiting and shell.
Weevil damaged the crop consider
ably in Eastern and Southern Texas,
Southern Kansas, Western Florida
and Southwestern Georgia, and dis
astrously in Mississippi, Alabama
and portions of Louisiana.
"Much of the crop in Southern
Mississippi and Alnbama, because of
rain and weevil damage, will re
quire from 10 to 20 acres of land to
produce a bale of cotton. In the
Carolina and Georgia hot sunshine
following the July rain on the sappy
plant caused much shedding.
"Lack of fertilizer, which tas
leached from the soil by the July
rain or withdrawn by grass and
weeds, is shown by the appearance
of the plant, which seems to have
reached maturity with a small stalk
and lack of fruit. There are many
grassy fields in the eastern States.
Caterpillars are resorted in Texas,
Louisiana. Florida and Georgia, but
have done no material damage as yet.
"Pirkinr is general over the south
ern half of the belt, and even in Ok
lahoma, where there is much prema
ture opening. Virginia, Tennessee,
N'orthwest Mississippi, Eastern Ar
kansas and Missouri have good to
splendid crops of cotton."
