thai the democratic ticket named on

political observer! are acratchlng
thell heads and trying to reach 0
conclusion as to hOW it is firing to
figure out.
Ii is no secret that the nomination

well, they want
the commanding position that he had
; taken In national affairs, combined
with his pleasing personality and his
ability as a campaigner render his
election one of the beat beta of ihe
I campaign. They also believe that ihe
'splendid organizing ability of Mr.
j Walton ami his tremendous personal
popularity in every section of New
(Mexico and among ail classes of cltl
j z. us lends strength to the ticket that
;it would he hard lo get elsewhere.
Just what the progressives will
I bring to the ticket is a matter that
only a count of Ihe voles will reveal.
. Not i va n the most sanguine democrat
expects such a large republican drift
to the ticket as took place iii I ! I 1
and il is realised that the showing of
the progressives in 1914 was not flat
tering; inn ihey believe that the nom

poration commissioner and former
Governor Miguel A, Otero for auditor
