Wilson Gives Lengthy Address to
Enthusiastic Audience at
His Summer Home
GIVES VIEWS ON THE
MEXICAN QUESTION
Nation's Leader Admits Making
Mistakes But Says They
Were Not Intentional
Long Beach, N. J., Sept. 2.—Presi­
dent Wilson formally accepted his re
nomlnation here this afternoon with
an address recounting the legislative
record of the Democratic party, a vig­
orous defense of his Mexican policy,
his dealings with the European bel­
ligerents and an outline of his view
of America's obligations for the fu­
ture.
With the members of the notifica­
tion committee headed by Senator
James grouped about him at Shadow
Lawn, the Summer White House, the
President declared the Republican
party was "just the party that cannot
meet the new conditions of a new
age" and that the day of Little Amer­
icanism when "methods of 'protec­
tion* and industrial nursing were the
chief study of our provincial states­
men" was past ana gone.
"We can no longer indulge our
traditional provincialism" said the
President. "We are to play a leading"
part in. the world drama whether we
wish it,, or not. We shall lend, not
borrow act for ourselves, not imitate
or followed organize and initiate, not
peep about merely to see where we
may get in."
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia­
tions with the European belligerents
the President followed a declaration
that while property rights might be
vindicated by claims for damages, the
loss of life and the fundamental
rights of humanity never could be,
with this statement:
"The record is clear and consistent
throughout and stands distinct and
definite for anyone to judge who
wishes to know the truth about it."
Immediately afterwards he said:
"I am the candidate of a party,
but I am above all things else an
American citizen. I neither seek the
favor nor fear the displeasure of that
small alien element amongst us which
puts loyalty to any foreign power be­
fore loyalty to the United States."
Regarding his Mexican policy the
President "reiterated that trie people
of Mexico were struggling "blindly,
it may be—and as yet ineffectually"
to free themselves from alien in­
terests "some of them Americans
pressing for things they could never
have got in their own country" and
that he wbuld do everything in his
power to prevent anyone standing in
their way.
"It is hard doctrine," said he, "only
for those who wish to get something
for t^WkelVfek out' of Mexico." At
another point the president said:
"Mistakes I have no doubt made in
this perplexing business but not in
purpose or object." He declared at
another point:
"I am more interested in the for­
tunes of oppressed men and pitiful
women and children than in any
property rights whatever."
At the outset of his references to
the legislative achievements of his
party, the President enumerated the
laws placed on the statute books re­
lating to business, including tariff re­
vision, anti-trust, laws, revision of the
banking and currency system, rural
credits, rehabilitation of the merchant
marine and creation of the Federal
Trade Commission.
"What other party has understood
the task so well or executed it so
intellingently and energetically?" he
asked. "What other party has at­
tempted it at all? The Republican
leaders apparently know of no means
or assisting business but protection.
How to stimulate it and put it upon
a new footing of energy and enter­
prise they have not suggested."
"At the conclusion of his review
of the party record the President de­
clared:
"This extraordinary recital must
sound like a platform, a list of san­
guine promises but it is not. It is
a record of promises made four years
ago and now actually redeemed in
constructive legislation." Then, later
he said: "We have in four years
come very near to carrying out the
platform fthe Progressive Party as
well as our own for we are also
progressives."
The President's address was some
five thousand words long, one of the
most lengthy he has delivered on any
occasion since taking office.

cabin in which Abraham Lincoln was
born, a magnificent memorial hall
which shelters it and an endowment
fund of $50,000 for its maintenance
will be presented as a gift to the
nation next iMonday by the Lincoln
Farm Association. (Impressive cere­
monies at which will be present many
of the mtost important figures of the

first laid claim to its title.
In March 1806, Thomas Lincoln
with his bride, Nency Hanks Lincoln,
took possession of a farm on the
banks of Nolin creek, in Larue coun­
ty, then a part of Hardin county.
Here with his own hands, Thomas
Lincoln put up a rude log cabin con­
structed of unhewn logs, the chinks
daubed with clay, and in it Abraham
Lincoln was born, Feb. 12, 1909.

TO STRIKE ASPECT
Market Considerable Stronger
Result of Settlement of
Threatened Walk-out
Chicago, Sept. 2.—Confidence that
a settlemnt of the railway strike
would be effected lead to a decided
upturn today in the price of wheat.
The close was strong at the highest
level of the season, a net advance of
two and seven-eights to four and one
fourth cents. With December at
$1.47%' to $1.48 and May at $1.49% to
$1.49%. Other leading staples, too,
all showed gains—corn one-fourth
cent to seven-eights cent oats three
fourths cent to one and one-eighth
cent, and provisions fifteen cents to
fifty cents.
Disappearance of anxiety over the
chance that the eight-hour bill might
be defeated was evident from the out­
set in the wheat market All pres­
sure to sell was absent, and instead
signs developed that foreign demand
had again become urgent.
Corn, like wheat, showed a broad,
general demand. Oats displayed in­
dependent strength, owing to an­
nouncement that the British govern­
ment had taken 1,000,000 bushels here
for shipment.

ANOTHER ZEPPELIN
RAID OVER LONDON
Political Situation in Greece Ser­
ious No Anouncement of
the Outcome
London, Sept. 2.—In the first hard
battle between Roumanian and Aus­
trian troops the Austrians have been
forced to retire against the Cerna
river, north of Orsova, near the Iron
Gate on the Danube. Vienna an­
nounces that the Austrian troops
withdrew after five days of heavy
fighting.
In eastern Transylvania the Aus­
trian retirement continues.
London announces another Zeppe­
lin raid over the east coast of Eng­
land Saturday night. Few details
have been received, but bombs were
dropped at many places.
The Entente ministers at Athens,
says a belated dispatch from the
Greek capital, have drafted a note for
presentation to Premier Zaimis. The
note probably was bonded to the
Greek premier on Saturday. The
tenor of its contents is not known.
The arrival of, an allied fleet over
Piraeus, the port of Athens, has been
followed by the announcement that
the flag of France has been hoisted
on four German and three Austrian
merchant ships in the harbor. (Board­
ing parties from the Entente warships
seized the vessels.
Situation in Greece Serious.
Although reports are that the polit­
ical situation in Greece is growing
more serious, no announcement of
conditions has come either from the
Greek government or the Entente
capitals. The revolt reported in Mac­
edonia is now said to have spread
over the whole of northern Greece.
Dispatches S»om Athens say that
Premier Zaimis had a lengthy audi­
ence with King Constantine Thurs­
day and afterward announced Greece
maintained her policy of friendly neu­
trality toward the Ententes while
awaiting events. The Greek premier,
another dispatch says, told a com­
mittee appointed at a pro-Entente
mass meeting in Athens, that the
questions over which they were con­
cerned would be cleared up probably
before Saturday morning.
Russian Offensive Continues.
The new Russian offensive in Gali
cia and Bukowina continues success­
fully, Petrograd says, the Russians
having taken positions 40 miles east
of Lemberg. Xear the Hungarian
frontier, several heights have been
captured.
Attacks by the iRussians against
the Austro-German lines in Volhynia,
Galicia and the Carpathians were re­
pulsed, Berlin says. Some ground
was gained north of Thorow, Galicia
and nearly 1500 prisoners have been
taken by the armies of Prince Leo­
pold and Archduke Charles.
Announcement of operations on
other fronts in Europe show little
marked activity.

Mules That Haul Ancient Wagon
Can Only carry Enough
Water for Own Use
SAVE LIFE ON HIKE
By EWING LEWIS.
'Mercedes, Texas, Sept. 1.—"If we
were called on to cross into Mexico,
a motor ambulance would be of the
greatest value to us," said Captain
A. B. Welch of Co. A, First North Da­
kota, discussing today North Dakota's
campaign to raise funds for the pur­
chase of an auto ambulance. "The
mules drawing afield ambulance can
just about carry water enough for
their own use, which leaves the am
bulance crippled when it is needed
to carry the sick or wounded. I am
greatly desirous of seeing a motor
ambulance unloaded at the Mercedes
station some afternoon soon.
"It will be of great immediate ser­
vice. Our field hospital is a good
quarter of a mile from here, and a
swift trip may at any time save a
man's life. We have had a couple of
sun cases on hikes, not sunstroke,
but heat exhaustion. I think every
man in the regiment would feel safer
if lie knew an auto ambulance was
trailing with us on every long hike."
Long Hikes Planned.
Hikes of from 20 to 30 miles are
planned for North Dakota within the
next 30 days. They will be made in
heavy marching order and the sol­
diers will carry with them everything
they would need if they marched to
the City of Mexico. Some of the
camping places for the night may be
beside the Rio Grande, where already

ATTITUDE OF RELIEF
EXPRESSED BY OTHERS
Chicago, Sept. 2.—F'rom Chicago to­
night went telegrams to every divi­
sion point on western railroads in­
forming both railroad and trainmen
officials that the strike is off. A gen­
eral attitude of relief was expressed
by minor railroad officials. President
Ripley, of the A. T. & S. iF. Ry,, said,
however, that he was sorry the ques­
tion had not come to a critical test.
"I am sorry it has been called off,"
Mr. Ripley said. "The Adamson bill
does not become effective until Jan­
uary 1. Between now and then we
can decide what to do."
HUGHES SPEAKS AT
ST.
Monster Crowd Gives Republican
Nominee a 21-Minute
Ovation.
St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 2.—Charles E.
Hughes faced an audience in the Coli­
seum here tonight that cheered him
for 21 minutes and in his talks re­
ferred repeatedly to points made by
President Wilson in his acceptance
speech.
"I protest," Mr. Hughes said,
"against the extravagant Claims that
the anti-trust act was clarified by a
definition by our opponents. They
folded themselves up in a vague
phrase and presented that as a reg­
ular phrase." Mr. Hughes said that
"from the claims of our opponents,
with respect to child labor legislation,
you would suppose they had discover­
ed children.
"I am for the protection of chil­
dren," he said. "I was for it before
the present administration was heard
of."
Mr. Hughes referred to the child
labor legislation enacted during hi9
term as governor of New York.
"I think I know something of child
labor, and the importance of protect­
ing it," he said. "The recent bill
passed in congress affects a very
small number of children in this
country. There remains a vast amount
of necessary work to be done by our
states before child labor shall be
prohibited to a degree which will
safeguard this important asset. I
am for the protection of our chil­
dren."
The nominee declared that the bus­
iness men had a right to know what
he could and could not do.
Last Edition
LEADERS ACT IMMEDIATELY
Adamson Measure Goes Through With*
out Amendment and Men Will Not
Walk Out Tomorrow Morning.
PRES. WILSON WILL SIGN
THE DOCUMENT TODAY
Washington, Sept. 2.—The threat of a general railroad strike,
which has been hanging like a pall over the country for a month,
was lifted tonight.
Three hours after the senate had pa'J&ed, without amendment,
the Adamson eight-hour day, passed by i:hc house yesterday, the head*
of the four great railroad employes' brotherhoods telegraphed 600t
odd code messages to their general chairmen in all parts of the coun*
try, canceling the strike order issued a week ago, to take effect at
7 o'clock Monday morning.
The legislative expedient to avert the strike was pasted In the
senate by a vote of 43 to 28, almost a strict party vote, amid stirring
scenes, after many senators, Democrats and Republicans, had fought
desperately to amend the measure by provisions designed to prevent
industrial disasters in the future. Some senators, thoroughly arous
ed, declared congress was being coerced into enactment of legists
tion that it did not desire and that it knew would return to plague It
in the future.
In both houses the measure was signed within a few minutes af­
ter the final vote in the senate, and it was sent at once to the White
House, where President Wilson will sign it at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning. Officials of the brotherhoods, who witnessed the passage of
the bill, had announced early in the night that cancelation of ttie
strike would not be ordered until the bill had been signed, but lat|r
conferred and flashed the code messages signaling to the waiting
trainmen of the country that a satisfactory settlement had been se*
cured.
The Bill.
The bill that stopped the strike
provides that after Jan. 1, 1917, eight
hours shall be Tegarded as a basis
of. reckoning for a day's pay of men
engaged in the operation of railroad
trains in interstate commerce
cepting roads less than 100 mile*
long and electric lines) that they
shall receive pro rata pay for work
in excess of eight hours, and that
their rate of compensation shall not
be changed pending an investigation
for six to nine months of the effect
of the eight-hour day upon the rail*
roads by a commission to be appoint:
ed by the president.
Efforts to Amend It Futile!
Efforts to amend the bill in ths
senate were futile, the supreme effort
to avert it having been lead by Sen*
ator Underwood, who sought to pro*
vide that the interstate commerce
commission should have power to flx
wages and hours of service in the fu*
ture. This was defeated, 57 to 14.
Railroad officials have declared
that the action of congress will cost
them $&0,0'00,000 a year in increased
wages to the trainmen. Brotherhood
officials say the enactment will mean
not more than an annual increase of
$20,000,000. in congress and among
the railroad officials there has exist­
ed no doubt as to the constitutional*
ity of the law, but what steps, if any,
will be taken to test this has not been
indicated.
Leaders Act Quickly.
Quick action by the brotherhood
heads followed the action in the sen*
ate.
Issuance of the orders of cancella*
tion followed a meeting of the four
brotherhood heads and 13 remaining
members of their committe of MO.
Some opposition to acting before the
president actually had affixed his sig­
nature was evidenced in the meeUng
but in the end the 17 voted unanim*
ously to call off the strike immedi­
ately. All the code messages had
been prepared in advance and clerks
rushed to telegraph offices with arm­
loads of messages. Xo two of the
more than 600 messages were alike.
It was thought that if the order
was not sent out until tomorrow many
small nlt-Taph offices probably would
be HoseiS. and the 10,000 or more
local chairmen. all of whom In turn
are receive messages from the 40
general chairmen, might not be ad*
vised. The four brotherhood heads
were invited tonight to be present
tomorrow morning when President
Wilson signs the bill. The president
will use four pens in affixing his
signature and each of the labor lead*
ers will be given one as a souvenir.
Although members of congress
breathed easier when their taak was
done, the relief was not so much a
demonstration of satisfaction over th«
legislation enacted as over the im*
mediate results it accomplished. «...
