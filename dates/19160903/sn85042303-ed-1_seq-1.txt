OF 43 TO 28.
A revocation of the strike
order is expected within a few
hours.
With the time for a vote on
the ei;:ht-hour bill in the senate
tentatively fixed for six o'clock,
the general debate occupied
the attention of the senate
with indications that the com
pleted measure would pass the
senate and be in Wilson's
hands tonight. The president
kept in close touch with the sit
uation here, although he was
busily engaged in the notifica
tion ceremonies at Shadow
Lawn.
The first official statement
that the passage of the bill
would be wholly satisfactory to
the Brotherhoods came from A. I
II. Garretson, the spokesman
for the Brotherhoods, today.
He said: "Just as soon as the
house bill un-amended becomes
a law, the strike order will be
recalled."
Senator Sherman, republican
assailed the efforts of the Bro
therhoods and other labor or
ganizations to prevent the pass
age of a compulsory arbitra
tion law and charged Wilson
with making a "petty political
bargain" on the eve of election.
Every effort was used in the
senate to pass the bill in its
original form, fearing that any
amendment might throw the
negotiations into an indefinite
staere.
Anticipating the passage of
the eight-hour day bill in the
the federal government paid the men
HO cents per day In rations to work
