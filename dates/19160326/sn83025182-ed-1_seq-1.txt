Lives Lost When the Sussex
Disaster While Crossing the
English Channel.
CAUSE OF EXPLOSION NOT DETERMINED
Several of the Passengers Say They Saw Tor
pedo Fired at the Boat When Near
French Coast.
[By Chaa. P. Stewart, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
LONDON, March 25.—Four Ameri
cans have been.killed, two seriously
Injured and at least one other may
have lost his life in the sinking of
the steamers Sussex and Englishman
by torpedoes or mines in the last
twenty-four hours.
More than fifty other Americans
narrowly escaped death in the two
catastrophes.
About fifty persons were killed out
right by the explosion, or drowned
when the. Sussex met with disaster
while crossing the English channel to
Boulogne, with 380 passengers, most
of them women and children. Fifteen
or sixteen horse tenders and mem
bers of the crew,. including four Amer
icans, .of the .Englishman,. perished
when, ths vessel was annkvia British
waters-.
Prof. J, M. Baldwin, one of the
Americans aboard the- Sussex is miss
ing. Survivors landed at Dover and
reaching London tonight reported he
had been taken off by a- boat bound
for Boulogne. His name, however,
was not Included in the list of Ameri
cans arriving at Boulogne telegraphed
here. It 1b possible that other Ameri
cans have been lost.
Met
passengers agreed that they saW a
torpedo. A Paris dispatch quoted
Samuel Bemis of Medford, Mass., who
was enroute to France to join an am
bulance corps, as stating positively
that be saw the wake of a torpedo
just before the explosion.
The London agents of the line, the
admiralty and the American embassy
were conducting separate investiga
tions tonight. No statement was
given out from either source, but sev
eral of the company's offlc}*ls ex
pressed the private opinion tonight
that the steamer had struck a mine.
Important evidence was handed the
admiralty tonight by British naval
officers who were aboard the Sussex
and were landed at Dover. They
picked up fragments of steel after
the explosion: An .admiralty investi
gation, it-iw-^wtMr probably will "Shotf'
whether these fragments formed part
of a torpedo or a mine.
Additional interest was lent to the
Sussex disaster when it became
known that a very high English per
sonage was aboard the packet, bound
for France. This person, whose name
cannot be made public at this time,
took command of one of the-life boats
and went to the rescue of an Italian
woman, who went raving" mad when
the explosion occurred, and jumped
overboard.
[Premier Asquith, Lord Kitchener
and other members of the British
cabinet were expected to go to Paris
late this week or early next, to at
tend the allied war council. It is pos
sible the "very high English person
age" referred to, was one of these.]
Another party of Sussex survivors
reaching London late tonight quoted
the captain as saying that he saw
the wake of the torpedo fifty feet
from the ship. He signaled to the

embassy tonight that he last saw
Miss Baldwin lying in the midst of
wreckage aboard the Sussex, bleeding
from a wound in the head. A woman
was attempting to staunch the flow
of blood.
Ambassador Sharp obtained affida
vits from several American survivora
tonight. He told us upon our arrival
here that he is not yet convinced
that any Americans lost their lives,
in view of the contradictory reports.
The naval and military attaches of
the American embassy left Paris to
night for Boulogne to begin an in
vestigation for the purpose of ascer
taining whether the Sussex was tor
pedoed or struck a mine. They plan
to question the officers of the chan
nel steamer and to examine the hull
of the Sussex when she is dry-docked.
At least a dozen persons must have
been killed outright when the explo
sion wrecked the forward part of the
Sussex, as she was nearing the
French coaBt.
Others were mangled and hurled
wounded into the water. How many
of these perished before the boats
reached them could not be learned
accurately in the confusion existing
here tonight. Women survivors, sepa
rated from husbands or children, are
running about frantically seeking to
learn if their relatives are among
those reported landed at Dover.
I had walked forward a short while
before the explosion. Several dozen
passengers taking'advantage of clear
weather were on deck despite the
sharp atmosphere. It is inconceiv
able that many of these could have
escaped in the terrific blast that
broke and splintered the forepart of
the Sussex.
A man dived overboard a moment
after the explosion. That started a
panic. Several women Jumped carry-

President Must Decide Wheth

Are the 'Last
Straw."
SITUATION LOOKS DARK
Unarmed Liners Torpedoed Without
Warning, With Many Ameri­

QBy J. P. Toder, United Press Staff

"WASHINGTON, March 25.—With
full realization that a new crisis in
German-American affairs may be ap
proaching, this state department to
night anxiously awaited more com
plete details on the catastrophe that
befell the channel liner Sussex and
the sinking of the steamer English
man, with a reported loss of four
American lives.
Both' Ambassador Page at London,
and Ambassador Sharp, at Paris,
cabled that early reports indicated
the Sussex was torpedoed.
"The situation looks dark," was the
declaration of one administration offi
cial. The views of President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing were not ob
tainable, but this significant remark
was made by a high official:
"The president must decide whether
this is the last straw."
Publicly the state' department an
ounced it must have all the facts be
fore any opinion is formed. It must
be Irrefutably shown, it was said,
Jthat. todays'r^orts are true and to
that .-end diplomatic and Consular
agents in England and France were
urged by cable to hurry all details
obtainable concerning the disaster to
'both vessels.
"There will be a show-down, be
yond question," said an official, "if our
investigations prove the case as bad
as early adv^es have fndicated. It
is now or never with "the United
States unless we are to give in on
all points we have striven for since
the Lusltania was sunk."
Of the two cases, the Englishman
f»T early reports, was regarded as the
most flagrant. This was true, it was
pointed out not merely because four
Americans aboard the vessel were
there- in performance of their daily
duties. There is nothng to show the
Englishman was armed. It has been
against unarmed attacks on such ves
sels that the president has expressed
the strongest condemnation.
In the event of the reports now be
ing obtained leave any doubt as to
whether the vessels were torpedoed,
Germany and Austria will be asked
immediately for any knowledge they
may have.

declaration that propaganda along
the border is disseminating false re
ports on the Mexican situation to
"create intolerable friction between
the government of the UnKed StRtes
and the defacto government of Mex

The president charges that sensa

He adds "the people of the United

"As has already been announced,
the expedition into Mexico was or
dered under an agreement with tho
defacto government of Mexico for the
single purpose of taking the bandit
Villa whose forces had actually in
vaded the territory of the United

A Warning to the People
Regarding the Mexican Situation
people of Mexico who are very sus
ceptible indeed to impressions re
ceived from the American press, not
only, but also very ready to believe
that these Impressions proceed from
the views and object of our govern
ment itself. Such conclusion, it must
be said, are not unnatural because
the main, if not. the only source of
information, for the people on both
sides of the border, is the public
press of the United States. In order
to avoid the creation of erroneous
and dangerous lmprej.iions in thii
way, I have called upon the several
news agencies to use the utmost care
not to give news stories regarding
this expedition the color of war, to
withhold stories of troop movement
and military preparations which
might be given that interpretation,
and to remain from publishing unveri
fied rumors of unrest in Mexico. I
feel that it is most desirable to im
press upon both our own people and
the people of Mexico the faot that the
expedition is simply a necessary
punitive measure, aimed solely at the
elimination of the marauders who
raided Columbus and who infest the
unprotected district near the border,
which they use as a base in making
attack upon the lives and property of
our citisens within oar own territory.

Numerous detachments of UMted

the rocky defiles Of the Santa Clara

Brigadier General Pershing's men
were carrying out hia plans with all
