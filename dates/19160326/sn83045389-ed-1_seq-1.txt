President Wilson issued a warning; 1
to the people not to be influenced l?y !
alarm.st reports regarding the situa- |
tun. which he said were being dis
seminated l?y "sinister and tinscrtipu- I
Ions influences," and in the interest of
"certain American owners of Mexican |
properties." He reiterated that every ^
effort shotild he made to prevent the j
punitive operation? against Villa from ;

color of war,
As he wrote, the President had be
fore him the most reassuring advices :
received from the border since the

r>f Villa. They were sent by General
Funston. and satisfied army otlleials
that the Carranza government was do
ing all in its power to aid the pursuit.
At the Capitol, Senate Republicans
were called into conference by their
leader, Senator Galllnger. t" discuss
the border situation. They will meet
again on Monday, but it was admitted
h\ those present to-day that the sense
of the meeting was that steps should
be taken t?i compel the sending of ad
ditional troops to guard the border
States. That would probably mean
calling out the National Guard, as al
most all the mobile regulars now are'
on the border or in Mexico.
Hi:iM Hl.K A\S \VI*1I OM.V in

vi-ral Republican Senators asserted
that the minority members indorsed
the sending of the expeditionary force
after Villa, and wished only to co
operate with President Wilson in
p uarding the border Slates I hey
repudiated any suggestions that they
were playing politics. Senators from
border Slates have telegraphed in
quiries to towns along the interna
tional line as to the exaet situation,
and reasons for the alarming messages
they have received. The replies will
he considered at the conference on
Monday.
General Funston's message was a j
comprehensive review of the situation
on the border, and Secretary (taker an
nounced that it stated positively that*
t here bad been no strengthening of
t'arran/.a garrisons at Mexican border
towns since March H>. the day after
the Columbus raid. The secretary i
added that the department had not (
asked for the report. While its text
was not made public, i! was learned'
that the message also gave the location
and strength of Oarranza garrisons not j
onlv along Ihe border, but throughout .
all the territory involved in the ptir- '
suit of Villa. Officers. after reading
the dispatch, said the situation in
Mexico was most satisfactory.
General Obregon, Carranza War ?
Minister and military chief. tele
graphed the State Department to-day |
that there was no friction between the j
two governments; thai adequate Mexi
can forces were keeping with General j
Pershing, but that more would he sent
if necessary. With this statement and
General Funston's report, high army
odlcials were satisfied that Ihe end of
the pursuit was near. It Is known
that there are 35.000 Carranza troops
in the State of Sonora. shutting off all
escape for Villa to the west.
Reports to-day from Qncretaro said
a favorable decision on the proposed
protocol had l?een handed by General
Carran/.a to James I.. Jtogi.TB, Ameri
can special representative. It provides
for contingencies that may arise dur
irm the joint pursuit of Villa, including;
the use by American troops of Mexican
railroads.
Indications are thai General Funston
will be able to employ the Mexican
roads, perhaps to-morrow, thus reliev
ing an increasingly serious problem ol
supplies.
Authorii?i(ive. denials of me reported
raiii on Gibson's Ranch and the killing
of thiee Americans were received to
day. This Is in addition to General
Obregon's repudiation of the report
that l.uis Herrora had revolted, and
Secretary Lansing's assurances to Mr.
Arredondo that a munition shipment
to loyal Carranza troops would not bo
delayed may Induce _ Senate Republi
cans to delay further action to force

cress to-day. A joint resolution di
