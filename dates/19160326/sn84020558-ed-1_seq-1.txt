The British naval guard In the
North sea beaded off, on February 29,
a German raider which was trying to
run the blockade, it is announced of
ficially in London. In the resulting
engagement both the raider and the
auxiliary cruiser Grief and the Brit
ish armored Alcantara that stopped
her. were ' sunk, the fight being de
scribed as a hot one, recalling the
naval duels of the days before the
iron clads.
The German and British statements
are at variance regarding the en
gagement. Only one British vessel
is mentioned in the London admiralty
account, while Berlin declares that
three British cruisers and a destroyer
were in the action. The Grief was
struck by a torpedo from a 15,000 ton
cruiser and finally blew herself up,
the German admiralty asserts. Lon
don says a torpedo from the Grief
sent the Alcantara to the bottom.
The British captured some 120 Ger
mans from the raider.
There has been no renewal of the
German attacks on Verdun fortress,
but the artillery has been notably ac
tive, Paris reports. According to the
German war office, Verdun was set on
fire by German shells during' the
artillery exchanges.
On the Russian front ' the German
lines have been subjected to further
heavy attacks, both to the northwest
and to the south of ' vinsk. Berlin,
however, declares that all the Russian
attempts to advance were complete
failures. - "

to believe Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
accused' of poisoning his millionaire
father-in-law, John E. Peck, or Grand

Waite registered with her as "Dr. and

Mrs. Horton, who was subjected to
an all day examination, was said by
Mr. Dooling to have stated that she
believed Waite planned to kill her and
her husband.
"Mrs. Horton" continued Mr. Doo

of medicine."
Mr. Dooling added that Mrs. Hor

QUERETARO, March 25. The war
department officials denied today the
persistent rumors that General Luis
Herrera had one over to Villa. The
report of this and other alleged de
fections is said to he the work of
reactionaries for the purpose of com

The pursuit of Villa bandits is be
coming more rigorous. General Luis
Gutierrez today reported the capture
and execution of Paldomer Santana,
a general attached to Villa's forces
and said to have been oneof a party
of 1,500 who remained on the Mexican

STILL WAITING
RepuDlican A. P. Leased Wire
SAX ANTONIO, Tex., March 25.
Carranza's delay' in permitting the
movement into Mexico over the North
western railway of supplies for the
American troops, has created an im
patience at army headquarters that
today was hardly disguised. The
quartermaster's department has ex
pressed the assumption that finally
Carranza will authorize the use of
the railroad and has sent to El Paso
quantity of stores for immediate I
fhipmont. Officers here did not
credit the unofficial report that Gen-
eral Alvaro Obregon, Carranza's sec
retary of war, had said that no per
mission for us-e of the line would be
given.
The utilization of the flying corps
for transmission of reports from the
field was regarded at headquarters
with keen satisfaction. The wireless
has not been a success and in the
absence of telegraph ,wires. General
Pershing has not been able to render
detailed reports and for days at a
time no report of any character has
reached here of the front.
Uneasiness occasioned by the lack
f news from cavalry columns was
evident todav at General Funston's
headquarters, although he displayed
an optimistic continence in deneral
Pershing's campaign methods. His
longing for more news, however, was
unconcealed. Monday General Persh
ing reported the dispatch of three
cava'ry columns sodthward from
Casas Grandes. Friday he reported
that two of them were in the vicinity
of Namiquipa. That is the net amount
of official information that
reached headquarters.

EL PASO, Tex., March 25. Villa has
outwitted his pursuers by splitting his
forces, leaving one body to hold in
check the Carranza troops in the neigh
borhood of Namiquipa, while he him
self, at the head of a picked force," is
trying to break through the lines of B'.s
enemies south of Madera, according to
information brought here today by
Americans arriving from Pearson and
Casas Grandes.
This information redoubled the inter
est with which word is awaited from
General Pershing that the American
troops have clashed with the Villistas.
According to reports from usually re
liable sources, coupled with what is
known officially as to the progress of
the punitive columns, American caval
ry reached Madera yesterday and
should be close on the heels of the fu
gitive bandit today. 1
From Madera 30 miles south of Tu
tuaca, a mountain trail winds through
the Sierra Madres. At Tutuaca it
bends sharply to the southeast until It
is lost in the wild and barren country
south of Minaca. This trail was known
for years as "Pancho's road." It was
popularly believed to have been brok
en by the bandit and its intricacies are
known to few but him. Wagons can
not pierce the desolate mountain region
through which the trail runs. One of
the few Americans known to have pen
etrated the district is Ben Harris, a
veteran scout who is now living there.
He declared today that if Villa suc
ceeded in reaching Tutuaca the task of
finding him would be hopeless. ;
A Mexican cowboy arrived here to

himself with about two hundred men

President Issues Warning
That Alarmist Reports
Are Being Spread in In

Owners of Properties
SAYS NOT TO
CREDIT STORIES
Calls Attention Again to the
Government's Announce
ment Sole Object of Puni
tive Expedition is to Pun
ish Villa and Followers
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 25. Presi
dent Wilson issued a warning tonight
that "sinister and unscrupulous influ
ences" were spreading alarmist re
ports about the Mexican situation with
the object of forcing intervention by the
United States" in the interest of cer
tain American owners of Mexican prop
erties." In a formal statement, the president
told the people of the United States to
be on their guard and not to credit
such stories. He urged those who dis
seminate news to test the source and
authenticity of every report from the
border, and called attention again to
the government's announcement that
the sole object of the punitive expedi
tion now in Mexico was to punish Villa
and his followers.
The news services supplying news
papers had been asked, the president
said, to assist in keeping this view
constantly before the Mexican and the
American people, to the end that the
expedition should not be given the color
of war.
The purpose of the American com
manders was described as embracing
co-operation "in every possible way"
with the forces of General Carranza,
and withdrawal from Mexican territory
as soon as the object of the expedition
has been accomplished.
The president solemnly warned the
people "that there are persons all along
the border who are actively engaged
in originating and giving as wide
currency as they can to rumors of the
most sensational and disturbing sort
which are wholly unjustified by the
facts."
The president's statement follows:
"As has already lieen announced, the
expedition into Mexico was ordered un
der an agreement with the de facto
government of Mexico for the single
purpose of taking the bandit Villa,
whose forces had actually invaded the
territory of the United States; and is
in no sense intended as an invasion
of that republic or as an infringment
of its sovereignty. I have therefore ask
ed the several news services to be good
enough to assist the administration in
keeping this view of the expedition
constantly "before both the people of
this country and the distressed and sen
sitive people of Mexico, who are very
susceptible indeed to impressions re
ceived from the American press, not
only likely but also very ready, to be
lieve that these impressions proceed
from the views and objects of our gov
ernment itself. Such conclusions, it
must be said, are not unnatural because
the main, if not the only source of in
formation for the people on both sides
of the border is the public press of the
United States.
"In order to avoid the creation of
erroneous and dangerous impressions in
this way, I have called upon the sev
eral news agencies to use the utmost
care not to give news stories regarding
this expedition the color of war, to
withhold stories of troop movements
and military preparations which might
be given that interpretation, and to re
frain from publishing unverified rumors
of unrest in Mexico.
"I feel that it is most desirable to
impress upon both our own people and
the people of .Mexico the. fact that the
expedition is simply a necessary puni
tive measure, aimed solely at the elim
ination of the marauders who raided
Columbus and who infest an unprotect
ed district near the border which they
