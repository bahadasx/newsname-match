Villa was reported today to be fleeing

ing successfully eluded the encircling
ring drawn about him by the Ameri
can and Carranza troops.
The news of his retreat was brought
from El Valle, but could not be of
ficially confirmed.
Funston Without Any Report.
San Antonio, Tex., March 23. No
report was received today from Gen
eral Pershing, and Funston's onl .
information on t lie developments in
Mexico was border gossip.
I'ershing's intimation yesterday thai
a more adequate means for delivering
supplies for his troops was advisable
has increased the anxiety at army
headquarters here to get a decision
from Carranza on permission to use
the Mexican railroads.
If Carranza permits the transporta
tion of supplies over the northwestern
railroad to the American troops in
Mexico, permission to ship over the
National railway will probably be
asked by the United States, it was
stated at Funstons headquarters here
today. Since the request for tho
Northwestern has been made, the dis
position of the American troops has
been such that the National railway
could now bo used to better advan
tage. Colonel Foltz, commanding at
Douglas, Ariz., reported to Funston
today that there are only two hun
dred troops in the garrison at Agua
Prieta and that no others have been
brought up. Funston has ordered a
battalion of the fourth infantry, sta
tioned at Del Kio, to Marfa and Pre
sidio, Texas, answering the appeals of
the citizens of those two border
towns.

Unless otherwise instructed by th j j
