galleries, so close to the roof that a
tall man standing tip-toe could hare
touched the rafters with his finger
tips, were packed tight long before
the bare spots on the floor began to
disappear.
The faces In the galleries, bal
conies, boxes and theends of the big
' oval floor blurred Into indistinct
splotches of white In the glare of the
big mercury lamps above the- ring.
In frail-looking perches, swung
from the rail of the second balcony,
the moving picture men focused
their cameras on the ring.
The preliminaries began, but for all
, the crowd cared the boxers might as well
. have been pummelling each other in. their

' qUently looked across tha ring to Moran's

CENSOR AT FRONT
KEEPSLID TIGHT
Correspondents Allowed to Send
Only Twenty-Five Words
Daily by Wire.
ALL KEPT AT HEADQUARTERS
FIELD HEADQUARTERS,
UNITED STATES ARMY IN MEX
ICO, March 25. (By AeropUne to
Columbus, N. M.) Owing to lim
ited wire and wireless facilities the
total number of words which may
be sent from here by correspond
ents is 260 or 300 daily. This num
ber of words has been divided
equally among the correspondents
In the field, so that with the pres
ent wire limitations the number of
words which any newspaper may re
ceive by wire during a day Is about
twenty-five.
The censors in announcing this
limitation said that military neces
sities precluded any larger use for
the present or the army wires, which
are the only means of communication
from the field headquarters or the
front.
The correspondents with the army arc
bound by the same regulations as the sol
diers. None 6f them may visit Mexican
towns outside the lines and as at present
the army is occupying no such towns
all of them are outside the lines. Further
more; the censorship regulations do not
permit of correspondents filing over any
wires or by any other couriers than those
designated by tho censor. l'f to the
present no correspondents have been per
mitted beyond the field headquarters.
Fxcept tho brief dally dispatches by
wireless all news passing the censor Is
carried back by army malls.
' Brigadier General J. J.. Pershing. In a
talk to the newspaper men asked them
not to use the name of officers nor of
military units. He explained in a gen
eral way the movements now being made
against Villa. However, he cautioned the
correspondents specifically against using
any of thla Information. The newspaper
men have shared the hardships of the
soldiers on the marches. As the main
object was speed, all superfluous bag
gage had to be left behind, and as a re
sult most of the writing has been done
by daylight on account of tack of light
Sometimes the new has bean written by

Mexican Soldiers
Sensitive to Jeers
v . Of -Yankee Troopers
FIELD. HEADQUARTERS. March
(Via Aeroplane to Columbus, March 26.)
Americans who reside' In the portion of
Mexico through which 'the army chasln
Villa haa marched express tho belief that,
barring conflict with the Mexican army,
these American troops will have an op
portunity to establish business prosper
ity between the United States and north
west Mexico, There Is at present no in
dication at field headquarters that any
fighting is likely, except that sought
with the members ef Pancho Villa's
band. Therefore the Americans In touch
with the pursuing troops are watching
an unusual phase of . the troop move
ments, namely, the manner In which the
Americans treat tha Mexicans as Indl
Tlduals. These Americana declare that they look
lor the United States army, which pays
aa It goes, to create a good impression.
Bishop A, B. Call of the Mormon col
ony at Colonla Dublan said:
'Some of the Mexican soldiers are
small boys. I know of one from here
who was only 11 years old. Sometimes
these boys do not cut a very good military
figure on account of their youth and bare
feet. But they do not like to be laughed
at by American soldiers and their com
manders object to having fun poked at
their men. If the American troops going
through Mexico treat the Mexicans with
consideration In the small things the
first big step will have been made toward
establishing cordial relations between
Mexicans and Americana."

Telegram.) Admonishing all dry voters
that they should vote for none but pro

barger, U. McKelvla and one or two

Bryan had been admonished that no pol
1th s would be permitted, It could easily
be seen that the drift of his remarks
were along the line of voters always re
membering that Brother Charlie was a
candidate for governor.

mine or a torpedo, but officials believe

been crossing the channel daily on regu
lar schedule since the beginning of the

ture which haa befallen any of them.

on the Sussex.

Pancho Villa was reported today to
