WILSOA
President Fights Those Whom
He Declares Seek to
Provoke War.
President Wilson issued a statement
last night denying any possibility of in
tervention in Mexico.
The statement says that "so long as
sane and honorable men are in control
of this government," it will not occur.
Warning is given against rumors of
a disturbing sort emanating from sources
along the border, and the press of the
country is called upon to assist the ad
ministration.
Only Purpose to Take Villa.
Thie President's statement follows:
*'As has already been announced the
expedition into Mexico was ordered
under an agreement with the de facto
government of Mexico for the single pur
pose of taking the bandit Villa. whose
forces had actually invaded the territory
of the United States. and i In no sense
Intended as an invasion of that republic
or as an infringement of its sovereignty.
"I have therefore asked the several news
services to be good enough to assist the
administration in keeping this view of
the expedition constantly before the
ipeople of this country and the distressed
and sensitive people of Mexico. who are
%ery sue-eptible indeed to impressions
received from the American press and
also very ready to believe that those
impressions proceed from the views and
objects of our government Itself.
Merely a "Pnaitive Measure."
"Such conclusions, it must be said, are
not unratural. because the main. If not
tI onli source of information for the
oule on both sides of the border is the
i utiL press of the United States. In order
to av.)id the creation of erroneous and
(anterous impressions in this way, I
have called upon the several news
A genies to use the utmost care not to
give news stories regarding the expedi
tion the color of war. to withhold stories
of troop movements and military pre
varatene which msight Te Eve that be

co.
"I feel that it is most desirable to im
rjreAs upon both our own people and the
people of Mexico the fact that the expedi
tion is amply a necessary punitive
mesure, aimed solely at the elimination
of the marauders who raided Columbus
and who Infest an unprotected district
niear the border which they use as a
base in making attacks upon the lives
and property of our citizens within our
own territory.
is the purpose of our commanders
to co-operate in every possible way with
the forces of Gen. Carranza In removing
this cause of irritation to both govern
ments and to retire from Mexican terri
tory so soon as that object is accom
p!Ished.
Sees laterventie Plot.
"It is my duty to warn the people of
the United States that there are persons
all along the border who are actively en
gaged in originating and giving as wide
currency as they can to rumors of the
most sensational and disturbing sort.
which are wholly unjustified by the
fact s.
"The object of this traffic in falsehood
is obvious. It is to create intolerable
friction between the government of the
I ited States and the de facto govern
nient of Mexico, for the purpose of bring
ing about intervenon In the interest
ot certain American owners of Mexican
propertics. This object can not be at
tained so long as sane and honorable
men are In control of this government.
jut very serious conditions may be cre
ated, unn-cessary bloodshed may result,
and the relations between the two re
publics may be very much embarrassed.
"The people of the United States should
know the sinister and unscrupulous in
fluences that are afoot and should be
on their guard against crediting any
story coming from the border. and those
a ho disseminate the news saodd make
it a matter of patriotism and of con
science to test the source and authen
ticity of every report they receive from
thaf qarter.

El Paso, Tex., March 25.-Pancho
Villa. the elusive bandit chieftain, for
whom io,ooo American soldiers and
half as many more Carranzistas are
hunting, has again demonstrated that
he is a great strategist.
The Americans and the Mexicans
who are co-operating, came toegther
from the four points of the compass
at El Oso, fve miles east of Nami
quapa this morning. The trap was
empty.
The reports received at Juarez say
there was not even a Villista in sight.
The enveloping movement had failed

Villa Near Sabrieers.
Villa himself is placed by Gen. Gabriel
Gavira. the Carransa commander at
Juares, as being a short distance from
Babricora. The forces of his command,
located at El Oso, forty-eight hours ago.
are said to be passing through the
Santa Clara canyon in an easterly direc
tion.
This force is commanded by Col. Cervan
tea, and it is believed he Is making for
Laguna station on the Mexican Central
Railroad. There is much speculation as
to how the escape was made. In certain
,official circles, there is a strong suspicion
that friendly Carranzistas aided.
The wireless reports to GeM. Funston
indicate that the advance guards of the
expedition have temporarily ceased
activities. Instead of the expected re
port of a battle, the information has been
received that Gen. Pershing has started
on a two-days' inspection trip of all the
troops in the field. The report ends by
saying there have been no clashes Involv.

Will Crosby. the Ameolan scout, who
led the way for the Pershing column
across the desert, reached 31 Paso from
Casas Grandes today. He said the
troops at that point are now on half
rations of hard tack and bacon. This
makes it certain that the cavalry column
operating more than 125 miles still fur
ther south are in no better plight.
A carload of gasoline was shipped over
the Mexican Northwestern from Juarez
this morning. It was consigned to a
Mormon merchant at Colonla Dublan,
but is known to be for the use of the
motor trucks stranded south of the bor
der for the lack of fueL
The Mexican authorities did not know
of the shipment, it Is said, until the
train had left. They investigated and
found the gasoline had been forwarded
on a regular bill of lading, and were
helpless to do more than complain that
they had been tricked.
Campaign Seene Shifts.
The imperative need of making use
of all railway lines running into
Mexico from Juares is admitted by
all officials familiar with the plight
of the troops. It is thought here Villa
has become convincbd that Carransa
will consent under the protocol. to
the use of the Northwestern, and has
decided to transfer his field of opera
tions to the district through which
the Mexico Central travels.
This would, of course, bring about
a demand for the use of the seeond
line, and the embarrassing delays
which would necessarily ensue.
Mexicans here believe Cervantes
will work south from Laguna. This
would make it possible for Villa to
