WILSON CHARGES A PLOT
TO INTERVENE IN MEXICO;
WILL PUNISH OFFENDERS
PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ISSUED
TO GUIDE THE
WASHINGTON, March 153.
by President Wilson to truide the
operations in Mexico:
As has already been annoi'iicud. (lie
expedition Into Mexlio was ordered
under nn ngreement wit.t the do facto
(Jovernmunt of Mexkn for tin- single
purpose of liking the tutulii Villa,
whoie force had actually Invaded the
tertltorof the I'nitcd States, and Is In
r.o sctiee Intended an Invasion of
that renublle o- as su rrrlngtmer.' of
ls snveietgnt'
I have thetefo! asi;il '.ie eeieal
news serv.ces to be good enough t as
sist tho Administration in keeplns lliD
view' of the expedition constantly be
foro both the people of this country and
the distressed and sensitive people of
Mexico, who are ver.. sus. cptlble in
deed to Imprefcions rere.icd from tho
American pre- not only, but aDo veey
ready to bcllrve that those Itiipris'tons
proceed ftotn the views and ohjecm of
our Ciovernment Itself
Such conclusions. It mast be sa.d, are
not unnatural, because the main if
not tho only sajurce of information for
the people on both n!de.s of the border
is the public press of the I'nlted Stutes.
In order to avoid the creation of erro
neoj and dangerous Impressions In this
r.iv 1 ha.v ctlled upon the several news
ngemles to use the utnioct cave not to
give news stories regarding this expe
dition the color of war. to withhold
stories of troop movement and mili
tary preparations watch might be given
that interpietation, ana to refrain from
publishing unverified ruiuois of unrest
in Mexico.
1 feel that It Is most desirable to
Imprens upon both our own people a id
the people of Mexico the fact that the
expedition Is simply a necessary puni
tive measure, aimed solely nt the elim
ination of the marauders who talded

PUBLIC ON MEXICO
This btatcmcnt was issued to-night
public retrardini? American military
Columbus, nnd who infest n I unpro
tected dlttr.ct near the border which
they uso an a base In making attacks
upon thn lives and property of our
citizens within our own territory.
It Is the purpose of our comma .iers
to cooperate In every possible way with
the fnrres of (!eu. (,'arranza, In remov
ing this cause of Irritation to both Oov
rrnmejitH and to retire from .Mexican
terr.tory so s.09ti as that object Is ac
complished. It is mv ilut' t'j warn the people of
the United Slates that, tlicro ate per
sons along tho border who are actively
-ngaged In originating and giving as
wide currency an they can to rumori
of the most sensational nnd disturb
ing sort, wliU h sre wholly unjustlilcd
by tho facts.
Tim object of th.s liaflic In false
hood is obvious, H Is to crea;e Intol
erable friction between the Covernmcnt
of the United States ami the do facto
(rovernment of Mexico for the purpose
of bringing about Intervention In tlie
interest of certain American owners of
Mexican properties.
This object cannot he at'atned so
long as rune and honorablw men are In
rontrol of this Jovernmeir, but very
.cr!ous conditions may b created, un
necessary bloodshed may result and tho
relations betweui tho two repusllcs,
may be very much embarrassed.
Tho people of the United Statu,
should know the sinister and uiis.'t-jpu-lous
Influences that ate afoot and
hould bo on their guard atf-lust cred
iting any story coming from tho bor
der; and those who disseminate the
news should m.ske it a matter of patri
otism and of conscience to test the
source and authenticity of every re
pot t they receive from that quar'.er.
