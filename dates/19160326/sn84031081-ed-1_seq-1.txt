This Information redoubled the in
terest with which word is awaited
from General Pershing that the Amrr-
lean troops have clashed with the Vil
listay. According to reports from
usually reliable sources, coupled with
what is officially known as to thi
progress of the punitive columns, !
American cavalry reached Madera
yesterday and should be ( lose on tho
IippIs of the fugitive bandit today.
From Madera to the south as far
us Tutuaca, a distance of about thirty
milcK, a mountain trail winds through
the Sierra Madro. At Tutuaca it
hrnds sharply to the southeast until
it is lost in the wild and barren coun
try south of Minacu. This trail was;
known for years (,s "rancho's road." J
It. was popularly believed to have been
broken by the bandit and its intrlcn- ;
cies are known lo few but him, No;
wagons can possible pierce the dc'i-
'ate inoi.iniu.in region through which j
the trail runs. One of the fewAmer-;

rare air makes living almost unbear
able. I ciiuhl defy 10,0011 soldiers tu
catch me in that country and Villa
knows every nook and cranny in it."
Apart from the keen anticipation of
news that. 111'.- American soldiers were
within reach of their prey the border
was mostly interested today In the
report from Washington that an
agreement had been reached in sub
stance between tho first chief and
Washington which would permit Gen
eral Funston to usw the Mexican rail
i oads.
At Fort Bliss activity was redoubled
to perfect arrangements for the mov
ing of supplies and eiiulnmcnt to
Junrez where they will be sent south
m the Mexican Northwestern rail
road. Supplies In TtcuillnetM.
Officers in the quartermaster's de
partment declared tonight that they
could start a tide of supplies of all
sorts to O'neral Vershlng's base of
fnsn Grandos within twenty-four
hours after word was received th.pt
perinlsnion to use the railroad had
been granted.
The using of tho Mexican lines hy
tlio Americans Is expected to be the
supreme test as to whether friction
wiih the Mexican people is, to he
averted and real co-operation he
tween the Carranzistas and the Unit
ed State expedition established. If
this test is safely passed, it Is believed
much of the tnenuce In the present
situation will have been eliminated.
The alarmists on the border were
unusually quiet today. The threats
made hy the local authorities that
persons ' caught spreading fals and
alarming reports would he summarily

i nd there are less wild stories than
usual being circulated in tin; barrooms
