People on Board Report Seeing
the Torpedoes as They Rushed
Through the Water.
Washington, March 25.—The chan­
nel steamer, Sussex, damaged yester­
day in the English Channel, and the
English steamer, Englishman, de­
stroyed by an explosion, both carrying
American citizens, were torpedoed,
according to consular reports receiv­
ed by the state department today.
Flat statements that torpedoes were
responsible were made in both cases,
but the consuls did not give the
source ot' their information.
Americans on Sussex.
Twentyjfive Americans were on the
Sussex, but whether any of them
lost their lives or were injured was
not established by the official report,
though the dispatches indicated Am­
ericans might have been lost. Four
Americans employed as horse han­
dlers were aboard the Englishman.
Xone was among the rescued landed
at a British port.
Coming at a time when the state
department was awaiting the result of
an investigation of the sinking of
the Dutch liner, Tubantia, and con­
sidering affidavits regarding an alleg­
ed submarine attack upon the French
ship, Patria, the destruction of the
Englishman and the damaging of the
Sussex raised again the possibility of
complications between the United
Slates and the Central European Pow­
ers.
Sharp Sends Important Message.
The most important dispatch re­
garding the Sussex £am.e f,roin
.-'iRaii* fit pjfrliC life
reported thai, the American consular
agent at Dieppe, Walter S. Palmer-
Samborn, had informed him lliat the
Sussex was torpedoed about six miles
off the French coast, while carrying
^S'i» passenges and a crew of !j.r, and
that CO to 80 passengers had been
wounded or killed. Ambassador
Sharp quoted Samuel Bemis, an Am­
erican, as saying that lie had seen
several persons killed in tin* explo­
sion.
Ambassador Page at London reporl
ed that the British government had
informed him of the disaster and sup­
plied the names of the 25 passen­
gers.
Sussex Was Torpedoed.
Paris, March 25.—The ministry of
marine, in an official statement issued
tonight from Paris, declared that the
Sitssex was torpedoes and 'estimates
the number of victims at about 50.
Scarcely any doubt exists tonight
that some American lives have been
lost with the destruction of the
steamer, Sussex.
Ambassador William G. Sharp sent
Naval (Lieutenant Eernord L. Smith,
by automobile, to Boulogne this after­
noon to investigate the cause of the
disaster and assist any Americans
who may need help.
Depositions Being Taken.
The depositions of some of the
American survivors, who have ar­
rived at Paris, are being taken by the
embassy and they will be forwarded
to the state department at Washing­
ton.
From 30 to 50 persons, according
to the estimates here, out of 380 pas­
sengers and the crew of 56, were lost.
The weight of testimony is that the
Sussex was torpedoed by a 'subma­
rine without warning.
London Reports State:
There were six Americans among
the 70 survivors of the Sussex who
reached Dover today on a British de­
stroyer. The majority of the surviv­
ors agree with the opinion of the
French admiralty that the Sussex
was torpedoed 'by a submarine.
-Miss Elizabeth Baldwin was killed
by the explosion, according to those
arriving at Dover, who state also that
'Miss Edna .Hilton is missing.
Nothing has been heard of the oth­
er 12 Americans who were aboard the
Sussex. However, as a great major­
ity of the rescued passengers were
landed at Boulogne, it may be possi­
ble they are among them.
It is estimated officially- that the
loss of life will reach 50. These were
either killed by the explosion or
drowned when one of the lifeboats
capsized. Two passengers, a man
and a woman, died in a hospital at
Dover tonight.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 74 (MEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, SUNDAY MORNING}, MARCH 2G. 1910. (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS) FIVE CENTS
President Wilson Isssued State­
ment for People to Be on Guard
Against Canards.
CARRANZA GOVERNMENT
CO-OPERATING WITH U. S.
"Sinister and Unscrupulous In­
terests Disseminate False
Statements."
Washington, March 25.—While ad­
ministration offfcuils described the
military situation in Mexico as serene
tonight, the day's development in
Washington forecasts a polical strug­
gle here next, week, with the admin­
istration's Mexican policy as the
storm center.
President Wilson issued a warning
to the people not to be influenced by
alarmists' reports 'of the situation,
which he described as "sinister and
unscrupulous, and in the interest of
certain American owners of 'Mexican
properties."
"Be On Your Guard."
In a formal statement, the presi­
dent told the people of the United
States to be on their guard, and not
to credit such stories. He urged
those who disseminate news to test
the source and authenticity of every
report from the border, and called
attention again to tlie government's
announcement that the sole object of
the punitive expedition now in Mex­
ico was to punish Villa and 'his fol
lowers. He reiter.ir.cil thai, every ef­
fort should be made in make the pun­
itive expedition as a move against
war.
Had Good Reports.
The president "had before him ihe
most reassuring- advices received
since the America,' columns began
their pursuit of Villa. They were
sent, by General T«'- ston and satis-
government, was doing all in its- pow
or to aid the pursuit.
Senate Republicano Confer.
At. the capitol, senate republicans
were called into conference by their
leader, iSenator (iallinger, to "discuss
the border situation. They will meet
again Monday, hut it was admitted by
those present today that Ihe sense
of the meeting was thai, seps should
be taken to compel the sending of
additional troops lo guard the border
stales.
In effect. 1 ha I would nieaji Ihe call­
ing out of the National (luard, as
almost all the mobile regulars now
are on the border or in Mexico,
Not Playing Politics.
'Several republican senators assert­
ed that the minority members en­
dorsed the sending of expeditionary
forces after Villa, and wished to co
operate with President Wilson in
guarding the border states. They re­
pudiated any suggestions that they
were playing politics.
"If we cannol get. anything done
ourselves," one senator said, "we can
at least, by unanimous action, arouse
such public sentiment as to force ac­
tion 'by the majority."
Mexican# Co-operating With Pershing
Officials also were impressed by
General Obregon's statements, tele­
graphed to the state department to­
day. The Carranza war minister and
military chief said there was no fric­
tion between the two governments,
that adequate Mexican forces were co­
operating with General Pershing, but
that more would be sent if necessary.
With this statement and General
Funston's report, high army officials
were satisfied that the end of the
pursuit was near. It was known that
there are 8.r,000 Carranza troops in
the state of Sonora, shutting off all
escape of Villa to the west.
The warning was issued after care­
ful consideration by the president and
his advisers of many official reports
from throughout the United States
and Mexico, including consular dis­
patches, saying that alarmists' story
of the intentions of the Washington
government were having an undesir­
able effect upon the Mexican people
and Americans residents in the repub­
lic.
Issue Statement.
The president's statement follows:
"As has already been announced,
the expedition into Mexico was order­
ed under an agreement with the de
facto government of Mexico for the
single purpose of taking the bandit
Villa whose forces had actually in­
vaded the territory of the United
States, and is in no sense intended as
an invasion of that republic or an in­
fringement of its sovereignty. I have
therefore asked the several ness ser­
vices to be good enough to assist the
administration in keeping this view
of the expedition constantly befor.
the people of this country and the dis­
tressed people of Mexico who are very
susceptible indeed to impressions re­
ceived from the American press, not
only but also very ready to believe
that such impressions proceed from
the views and objects of our govern­
ment itself.
"Such conclusions, it must be said,
are not natural because the main, if
not the only source of information for

Interesting Arson Case Conies to
an End in Fargo Court Late
Saturday.
Fargo, March 2.1.—The jury in Ihe
case of John Wynian who svas charg­
ed with burnlg his house to collect in­
surance, brought in a verdict of "not
guilty" at late hour tonight. The
jury was out twelve hours.
Important Case.
This is one of the most important
case that has been tried for some
time, and is the only arson case that
has attracted interest outside of the
state. Over a year ago the bouse of
the defendant was found on fire and
suspicion for incendiarism immediate­
ly attached to Mr. Wynian. He was
indicted and the case was sent to Val­
ley City on affidavit of prejudice.
When time for its trial in that piace
came, it was moved to have it come
up in the Cass county district, court.
This was done and voluminous evi­
dence was taken.

VILLA ENTERS THE
SANTA CLARA CANYON
Ml Paso, Tex., March 25.—A Mexi­
can cowboy, who arrived here today,
insisted that lie had seen Villa him­
self"
wiflV about li'OO ni'eh entering the
Santa Clara canyon, southeast of
Namiquipa, yesterday morning. This
canyon runs lor IfiO miles northeast
to Eneinillas, is from 2,000 to 3,0..i
feet, deep, and if the report is true.
Villa has entered i. trap from which
he cannot, possibly escape, if Carran
zistas block either end with sufficient,
men.
Troops Want Food.
Will Crosby, who entered Mexico
as scout, for the llilli Cavalry, return­
ed here today with a story that, the
American troops at Casas itrandes
were suffering from lack of food and
that the transportation system had al­
most completely broken down. Cros­
by said that when he left Casas Gran
des yesterday, the .soldiers had practi­
cally nothing but "hard tack" and
"bacon" to eat. lie said 27 trucks
with supplies left Columbus this
morning but that the trail across the
desert is almost impassable.
Train Fired On By Bandits.
Americans arriving at Laredo to­
night from Torreon said their, train
was fired into by T.00 bandits, suppos­
edly Villa followers, near Viesca, be­
tween Torreon and Saltillo.
The passenger train was followed
and preceded by Carranza troop train.
When the rear military train drew up
the Carranza soldiers fought the ban­
dits off. There were no American
casualties.
Troops Sight Villa Bandits.
A straggling band of Villa bandits
was sighted about 50 miles south of
here today by American forces en­
gaged in the punitive expedition into
Mexico to capture Francisco Villa, the
outlawed Mexican bandit. It' was evi­
dent, however, that Francisco Villa,
himself, was not in the party, which
consisted only of a few men and no
engagements resulted.
Reports Battle Yesterday.
Reports of a battle between Carran­
za troops and Villistas at Namiquipa,
approximately 7." miles south of here,
were received here today. The re­
ports asserted that battle was fought
yesterday but there were no indica­
tions of the number of men engaged
nor of the result. Villa is believed to
have only a few men w'th him some
reports indicating that his total force
approximate only 200 men.
Melbourne, Australia, March 24.—
The auxiliary ship, Aurora, of the

to a wireless from the vessel received

day.
Four members of the Aurora's
party were left behind at the Ross
sea base of the expedition.
It is evident from the Aurora's
wireless dispatch that the fate of the
lieutenant. Sir Robert Shackleton,
and the rest is unknown. Nothing
probably will be heard from them un­
til next 'November, when the ice
breaks.

Army Headquarters Chafing Over

NECESSARY TO USE
MEXICAN LINES
El Paso, March 25.—Carranza's de­
lay to permit the entrance into Mex­
ico over the Mexican Northwestern
railway of-supplies for the American
troops, has caused an impatience 'at
army headquarters today that was
hardly disguised. The quartermas­
ter's department has expressed the
assumption that finally Carranza will
authorize the use of the railroad and
has sent to El Paso a quantity of
stores for immediate shipment. Offi­
cers here did not credit the unofficial
report that General Obregon, Carran­
za's secretary of war, had said that
no permission for use of tne line
would be given.
Would Impair Efficiency.
Failure to send supplies through
Juarez over the railroad info the
country where the troops are now op­
erating would not stop the campaign
but it was admitted that: it would ma­
terially retard General Pershing's
activity. Already there has been so
much change in the position of the
mobile forces dispatched fipm Casas
Grandes that the logical railroad to
use for getting supplies to a part of
them would bo the National, which
saw «ti wigbt:«frow '4ri3ktliua*'
hiia instead of making thfe wide swing
to the northwest thai the Mexican
Northwestern does.
Logical Line.
The Northwestern is the logical line
for supplying troops near Casas Gran­
des, but since many of tlieni now are
more than a hundred miles farther
south, General Funston believes time
could be saved by routing the stores
over the National, especially as many
repairs would have to be made on the
Northwestern south of Casas Grandes.
Whether General Funston will re­
quest the government to get permis­
sion to use the National will depend
on Ihe answer to Ihe request already
made. He admitted the desirability
of using the route mentioned.
PEACE TALK
CAUSES FICHT
The Reichstag Adjourns Hurriedly
When Socialists Begin
to Quarrel.
Amsterdam, March 25.—Advices
from Berlin indicate that today's sit­
ting of the Reichstag, although it was
only a brief session for consideration
of the emergency budget, pending dis­
cussion of the regular budget in com­
mittee, was the stormiest on record,
and had to be closed by the president
owing to disorder caused by the So­
cialist group.
It began with a heated discussion.
The speech which caused the trouble
was by Herr Haase, who declared
that Germany would never win the
war, which would be a drawn con­
flict. He declared that the German
socialists hated ar and desired peace.
Want Honest Peace.
"The best patriots in all the country
are those who speau for an honest
peace," he is quoted as explaining.
These remarks provoked a tremen­
dous uproar, many socialists rising
from their seats and angrily disput­
ing with each other. Dr. Davis, a So
cialist, shouted to Herr Haase:
"Your policy is causing a prolonga­
tion of the war."
Other Socialists showered such epi­
thets as "traitor" on Herr Haase, who
again tried to speak, but members
crowded around him and threatened
to strike him, and the president hur­
riedly closed the sitting.

known l'or years as "Pancho's road."
it. was popularly believed to have
been broken by the bandits and its
intricacies are known to few but him.
Almost Impassable Roads.
No wagons can possibly pierce the
desolate mountain region through
which the road runs. Pew Americans
are known to have penetrated the
district. Ben Harris, a veteran scout,
who is now living here, declared today
that if Villa succeeded in reaching
Tutuaca the task of finding him
would be a hopeless one.
"Only Mexican ponies can take that
road," he said, "and even they must
be very lightly loaded.
Villa Knows Every Nook.
"The trail runs on the edges of
canyons three to four thousand feet
deep, and winds over bleak mountain
tops, where the cold and rare air
makes living almost unbearable. I
could defy on thousand soldirs to
catch me in that country, and Villa
knows every nook and cranny in it."
