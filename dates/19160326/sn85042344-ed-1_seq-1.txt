While aclmiiilMt ration offlcluls

Mexico as serene tonight, the day's
developments in Washington forcasl
a political struggle here next week
with the administration's Mexican
policy hs the storm center.
president Wilson issued u warning
to the people not to be Influenced liy
aim-mint repot ts regarding the situa
tion which he fa id were being dis
seminated by "sinister and unscrupu
lous influences" and In the interest of
"certain Amcrlcin owners of Mexican
properties." He reiterated that
evory effort should be made to pre
vent the punitive operations against
Villa from assuming In discussion the
color of war. "

serted that the minority members en
dorsed the sending ot tne expcuiuo.,
ary force after Villa and wished only
to co-operate with President Vv ilson
in guarding the border states. They
repudiated any suggestions that they
were playing politics.
"If we cannot get anything done
ourselves," one senator said, "wo can
at least bv unanimous action arouse,
such public sentiment as to force
action by the majority."
Senators from border states tele
graphed Iniiulries to towns along the
international line as to the exact
situation and the rensons for the
alarm expressed In messages they
have received. The replies will be
considered at the conference Monday.

General Funston's message was a
comprehensive review of the situation
on the border ami in ine region nuno
(icneral I'ershing's columns arc be
llevfd to be closing In on the bandits.
Secretary linker announced that it
stated positively as a matter of mili
tary information that there, had been
no strengthening of the Currunza gar
risons at Mexican border towns since
March 10, the day after the Columbus
raid.
The secretary added that the depart
ment bad not asked for tho report. . ;
Officials were Impressed by Oeneral
Obregon's statement telegraphed to
the state department, today. The Car
ranza war minister and military chief
said there was no friction between
the two governments; that adequate
Mexican forces were co-operating
with General I'crshlng but that more
would be sent If necessary.
With this statement and General
Funston's report high army officials
were satisfied that the end of the
pursuit was near. It was known that
there are 3!,UO0 Carrania troops In
Honora shutting oft all escape for
Villa to tlw west.

Officials today welcomed the re
port from Queretaro, the present seat
of government In Mexico, that a fa
vorable decision on the proposed pro
tocal had been handed by General
.farranxu by James U Rodger,
American special representative.
Indications are that General Kun
Bton will be able to employ the Mexi
can roads, perhaps tomorrow, in sup
plying his far-strotchlng lines, thus
relieving an Increasingly serious
problem.

President Wilson tonight
issued a wurnlng that "slnstrr

the I'nlted States "in the inter

Playing the Baby Act
Jim Harris' refusal to allow Ills name to go before the Ili-publlcan
state convention and his threat to frame up a contest before the national
convention is a baby act and puts him in the class of bolters along with his
managers and adJvisers, I.. G. Disney, AIvh McDonald and John Claypool,
and ought to effectually eliminate him Irom the confidence, respect and
support of all decent Kepubllcans In the state In striking contrast to the
bellicose, but baby-like attitude of Mr, Harris Is tho position of John tlale,
chairnian of the Progressive state committee, Mr. Hale says tho election
of Jim McUraw means a reunited party in Oklahoma and if the same
methods are carried out in the nntlonal convention pursued by the sup
porters of Mr. MoOraw In the state convention It will result in a cm pinto
unification of all factions in the Hepubllcan party. Mr. Haio further states
that the strongest supporters Mr. MoOraw had wore Progressives, notwith
standing the declaration of Disney and McDonald that they controlled the
Progressive vote In the state and would deliver It to Mr. Harris.
Then, too, the absurdity of Mr, Harris basing his proposed contest on
the ground that his contesting delegation from Muskogee, county was only
given half ot the vote from that county in the permanent organization is
evident when one recalls that In every test vote, with Aluskogee county's
full vote for him, as well as half of Stephen county' vote, which man Test iy
was a cloar steal, he was squarely beaten.
Mr. Harris has been defeated in a clear-cut, fair an square coqtest,
and he ought to quit his racket and every decent and honest Republican
who show very plainly that their sole
convention or else forever quit him cold.
Party organizations are very frequently strengthened by good, stiff con
tests between its members but when
be ended. It is only small-bore politicians who can not take dofeut grace
fully, and apparently that Is where Mr. Harris is allowing himself to be
placed by his own actions and the actions of a little band of politicians
who show very plainly that their sole Interest In the Republican party Is
of a purely personal nature.
Americans
newspapers had been asked, the
president said, to assist in keep
ing Oils view constantly before
the Mexican people und Ameri
can people to the end that tho
expedition should not be given
the color of war.

The president's statement fol

Mexico was ordered under an
agreement with the do facto gov

purpose of taking the bandit,
Villa, whose forces had actually
invaded the territory of the

intended as an invasion of that

SAN N'TONIO, March 25. Cur
ranza's delay in permitting the
movement into Mexico over the
Northwestern railway of supplies for
the American troops, has created an
impatience ut army headiiiarters that
today was hardlv disguised. The inir
termaster department has proceeded
on the assumption that finally Car
ruuxa will authorize the list! of the
railroad and lias sent to Kl Paso a
iiuaiilily of stores for immediate
shipment, officers here did nut credit
the unofficial report that Oeneral Al
varo t iln-egnii, farranzn's secretary of
war, had said that no permission for
the use of the line would be given.
l-'ailiire to send supplies through
Juarez over the railroad into I he
country where the troops now are op
erating would not stop the campaign,
but it was admitted that it would ma
tt rially retard lleiieral Pershing's ac
tivities. Already there has been so
much change in the positions of the
moliile force dispatched from Casus
(ii ancles Unit the logical railroad to
use lor getting supplies to a purl of
them would be the National which
goes straight from Juarez to Chihua
hua, instead of making the wido
swing to the west that the North
western does. The Northwestern is
the logical line for supplying troops
near ''as.is lirandes but since many
of them now are more than a hun
dred miles further south, (Ieneral
Funstnn believes that time could be
saved bv routing the stores over tho
National, especially since many re
pairs would have to he made on the
Northwestern south of Casus Orandes.

Whether Oeneral Fiinston requests

already made, he said, lie admitted
thu desirability ol using the direct
route, but recognized also tliu iuad

The utilization of the flying corps

t'neasiness occasioned by the Inck

evident today nt Oeneral Funston's
headouurters, although he displayed
an optimistic confidence In Oeneral
I'ershing's campuign methods. His
longing for mor-i news, however, was
unconcealed. Monnay uenoral Per
