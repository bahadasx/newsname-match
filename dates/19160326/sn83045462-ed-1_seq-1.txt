It was the greatest gatherig

oni his fighting left kept Moran
t a distance. Moran's best

c was bleeding after the fifth

closed at the end.
Willard Bushed to Hopes.
Willard was rushed to the ropes in
le third and received blow after blow i
1 his face. The crowd sensed a*nockit,
but the finishing punch was lacksr.
Moran put up a j<ame flsrht. Most of

Promoter Tex Rickard announced that

f this amount, the state received 71^
er cent of the gross receipts, which
mounted to $1 1,344.05. Willard's share
as $ 17,500 and Alopan's $23,750.
Combined with the percentage taken 1

To this must be added other expenses.

100.000, so that Tex Rickard and his L

'American People Are Told '
That They Must Be on Guard
s Against Malicious Reports
} President Wilson last night issued
J warning that "sinister and unscrupue
j lous influences" are spreading alarmist
;a '
j reports about the Mexican situation
,1 j w ith ?h*v object of foil ing' intervention
k ; hy the I'nitod States "in the interest of
certain American owners of Mexican
11
- j properties."
^ In a formal statement the President
, lold the people of the United States to
is j iie on tlieir guard and not to credit
such stories. He urged those who diss
j scminate news to test the source and
,f I auihenticity of every report from the
>' i border, and called attention again to
the government's announcement that
the sole object of the punitive expedition
now in Mexico was to punish Villa
and his followers.
, The news serviees supplying newspapers
had been asked, the President
a i said, to assist in keeping this view cou.
ejstantly before the Mexican and Ameris
j?-an people, to the end that the expedii
lion shouui not he given the color of
j war. The purpose of the American
h ; oninianders was described as embrac(|.
ing co-operation "in every possible
way" witp tin forces ot Hen. 4'arranza
{ami withdrawal from Mexican territory
v las soon as 111 object of tip- expedition
e ! is accomplished.
K Reports Wholly Unjustified.
ji The President solemnly warned the
| people "that there are persons all
I along the border w ho are actively ertj
gaged in orginating and giving as wide
j currency as they can to rumors of the
* j most sensational and disturbing soft.
' j w hich are wholly unjustified by the
I facts."
1 The warning was issued after careful
jj consideration by the President and his
! advisers of many official reports from
j throughout the I'nited States and Alexico,
including consular dispatches say tag
* that alarmist stories of the intentions
? of the Washington government wera
y having an undesirable effect upon the
.Mexican people and Americans resident
in the southern republic.
'I The possibility that Hen. t'arransas
f j Jtaiid nuglit he w eakened to a perilous
e j extent should t lie Mexican public mla-|
understand the American expedition
e j has hen a prevailing factor in the eu
t ire operations against Villa. The qussnjtion
of alarmist reports was considered
h> tlie cabinet Friday and the PresiI
dent conferred at length w ith SecreI
iar> Lansing before he issued bis
; w arning last night
? Drastic steps tnay be taken if the
-I warning is not heeded. Various sugit
j gest ions have been advanced for legal
procedure to remedy the situation, one
^ I measure suggested being invocation of
j the law against circulation of reports
. j calculated to incite to arson and riot.
