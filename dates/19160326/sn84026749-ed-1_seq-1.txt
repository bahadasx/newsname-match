WASHINGTON,
Visit of Emperor Expeoted to
Mark Important Campaign
on Russian Front.
FIGHTING AT JAC0BSTADT
Muscovites Open Vigorous As
sault After Being Re-enforced
by Siberian Reserves,
LONDON. March 2S.-Emporor' Wll
Ham Is going to the Eastern front to
superintend personally the operations
against the Itusslans, according to Pet
rograd dispatches.
It Is believed by mllttsry observers
that the Kaiser's visit will mark an
Important step In the campaign on the
Russian front. It Is stated that he will
make Vllna his headquarters while in
the East
The Russians are continuing their at
tacks with great vigor, having Just
been reinforced oy Siberian reserves.
These Jiave been brought up near Jacob
stadt. where the fiercest fighting Is tak
ing place.
The Russians have opened a battle
on a large scale west of that town, but
the official German statement declares
all the Muscovite attacks have been
uroncit uown wun enormous losses lo
the Russian.
Other Assaults Repulsed.
Berlin dispatches also assert that Rus
sian assaults southwest of Dvinik and
bvtore the German position near Vlday
were repulsed.
The fighting on the eastern front
shows no sign of modification, despite
rain and snow, which have Interfered
seriously with effective operations. The
'itusslans are charging In close forma
tion, regardless of cost In men, and at
several points have made advances.
Berlin claims that the Muscovites have
bean emailed from tho N.rntrh 1..U
vicinity and have been driven back as
far as Bllsnikl, and that south of
Wllelty the Czar's troops were able to
maintain tneir advanced position only a
short time.
Iq the western theater there have
been little more than big gun engage
ments for the past forty-eight hours.
The artillery rlrlnfl haa been violent on
both aides, but It has not been followed
up by extended Infantry operations. The
French made a successful surprise at
tack In the Argonne, taking some pris
oners In-the Courtes Chausseea locality.
Verdun Front Unchanged.
The Berlin official statement declares
no important changes have taken place
on the Verdun front
On the British front there have been
spirited artillery duels, and at one point
the Germans succeeded by a surprise
assault in reaching a section of tho
British trenches, but they were forced to
retire by the effective use of bombs.
No change Is reported by either Rome
or Vienna on the Austro-Italo front.
From Macedonia come reports of re.
newed activities on the part of the
French. The republic's forces near
qlevghell shelled Austro-Get man troops
who were attempting to repair bridges.
The French also bombarded enemy po
sitions In the vicinity of Dotran. There
occasionally skirmishes between patrols
In this region.

A vote on the literacy test section of
the Burnett Immigration bill will be
taken In the House tomorrow, Jndlea
tions oeing tnai mat. oooy win over

the gates of Ellis Island and other ports
shall be set against any Immigrant who
cannot read.
Prospects that the House may over
ride the expected veto of the Burnett
section was Increased late yesterday
when Congressman James It. Mann, the
Republican floor leader, said he opposed
the literacy test, but would vote for the
bill even If this provision Is retained In
It
On two ocraslons the House, has al
most overridden vetoes pf similar immi
gration measures both Presidents Taft
and Wilson have refused to accept the
literacy test.
Mr. Monn. however, said the European
war had changed conditions, and al
though he has voted four times against
the Immigration measure, he Is now
ready to support It.
If many other members take the same
vlow the Hous? will have a chance of
overturning Presidential dlsappinval.
The fear that thousands of tax-burdened
Europeans may seek tefuge In this
country af.er the was has strengthened
the came of restricted ImmlBiatlon.

MRS. JUAN
Vanishes From Los Angeles After "Dead or Alive"
Order for Her "Hombre" Is Issued Her Life
Punctuated by Ease and Luxury; at Times
by Smoke of Battle.
LOS ANGELES, March 26. Juanita, wife of the bandit, Villa
The Woman Who Waits.
She is today somewhere between this city, in which her erstwhile
palatial residence stands deserted, and the wild reaches of her native
Mexico.
Where? "Quien sabe?"
Perhaps she is following the trail of her outlaw "hombre." Or
perhaps she is making toward her girlhood home, seeking sanctuary
in Torreon.
All that her friends here will admit is 'that she closed her home
and vanished forty-eight hours after the "Dead or Alive'' order was
issued with the capture of "her general'' as its objective.
Yet wherever the trail may lead her, through mesquite-dotted
desert or painted canyon, Juanita Torres Villa in the end will be
found waiting, waiting, waiting, until her man has need of her, or
until he can turn from flight and fight long enough to take her in his
arms.
To those who do not know her, Juanita is just a little Mexican
girl, whom Chance, or Fate, or whatever one chooses to call it, placed
in the brief reflected glory of the man whose name is now anathema
along the border.
But to the few familiar with her story, her life as the girl-wife
of Francisco Villa is an appealing one. It is the story of a woman's
great love. It is cast against the colorful backdrop of the painted
Mexican plains, and in the border towns of the Rio Grande. Through
it ride bandit horsemen. It is at times dimmed by the smoke of bat
tle. In and out of it is woven revolutionary intrigue, and the
machinations of secret agents. At intervals it has been punctuated
by ease and luxury.
And in that rapidly moving film of events, Juanita has played

The United States is brought to
the verge of a rupture with Ger
many by official reports to the
State Department today showing
that the French steamer Sussex,
with twenty-five Americans aboard,
was torepdoed without warning in
the English Channel.

CRISIS NOW GRAVE.
A number of Americans have not been
accounted for. There were gravest feara
today that some bf them were among
the number killed when one of the elx
life boats cooslzed
An extenaed report was received by
the State Department today from Am
bassador Page at London. The Page re
port 5aid ihe explosion occurred with
out warning. An earlier report from
Page said the veseel was "reported tor
pedoed." While there Is not sufficient proof to
establish that It was a German sub
marine that destroyed the Sussex, it Is
believed that Germany will be held ac
countable because her submarines have
been operating In the English war rone
All officials gravely admit today that
the crisis raised by this new submarine
case Is the gravest since the Lusitania
went own.
Story of Bemis.
Ambassador Sharp, at Paris, trans
mitted the report or the American con
sul at Dieppe, which said the vessel
vtas torpedoed. The ambassador said
that one of the Americans, Samuel Be
mis, a Harvard graduate, said he nad
seen several persons killed by the ex
plosion. Uemls gave out a statement In Pari
that he had seen the wake of a tor
pedo. The State Department would
make no reference to this. This testi
