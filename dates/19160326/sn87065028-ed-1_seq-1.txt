to vote on the question of issuing
bonds in the sum of $40,000 for
the Improvement of their highways,
and a public meeting was held at
Caledonia, the largest town in the
district, Friday for the purpose of
showing citizens the good to be tie
rived from public roud improvement
and urging them to vote for the is
suance of the bonds.
The meeting was presided over by
Dr. E. M. Jamison, a Caledonia den
tist, and several enthusiastic
speeches were delivered by good
roads boosters, among those who
spoke having been Hon. B. A. Wea
ver, president of the Columbus Na

public highway commission of dis

secretary of the same organization;

Lowndes county is concerned, com

bond issue will increase the taxes of
property owners in the district af

those present were eloquently urged
to vote for the issuance of the bonds,
as the increase in land values result

more than offset the increase in tax

he has consented to have his name

MISS ROOT DIES WHILE ON
SIT
YOUNG LADY FROM MEMPHIS
SUCCUMBS . TO ATTACK OF
ACUTE INDICESTION.
Succumbing to a sudden attack of
acute indigestion, Miss Willie Root,
a pretty and exceedingly popular
young lady from Memphis, died at
the McKinley Sanatorium about 3
o'clock Friday afternoon, her death
having proven a severe shock not
only to members of the family but
to a host of friends.
Miss Hoot had for several weeks
been the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Lind
ley Ervin at their country home near
Columbus, one purpose of her visit
having been to recuperate from an
attack of illness which she suffered
in Memphis. The change was at first
apparently beneficial, her health hav
ing steadily improved until Thursday
when the uttack of indigestion seiz
ed her. Her condition became so ser
ious that she was moved to the Mc
Kinley Sanatorium, where she grew
rapidly worse until the end came.
As soon as Miss Root's condition
(became grave Memphis relatives
were notified, and, her brother, Mr.
John II. Root, and a sister, Miss Sue
Root, arrived just before the final
dissolution took place. They, togeth

CANDIDACY FOR OFFICE.
,,,,,, , ,
Mr. A. H. I'egues has consented
to enter the race for membership on
the board of public school directors,
and Ins official announcement for
the office has been authorized.
Mr. I'egues is well known through
out the city, and needs no introduc
tion to its people. He is prominent
in business, financial and religious
circles, being vice-president of the
Columbus Hardware and Furniture
Company, a director of the National
Bank of Commerce and a steward of
the First Methodist church.
In integrity Mr. I'egues is unim
peachable, and no man in Columbus
i-tands higher or commands more uni
versal respect that he. There can be
no doubt of the fact that he is well
qualified to discharge the duties of
the office which he seeks, and that
hi", candidacy will receive careful
consideration at the hands of his
constituents is a foregone conclusion. '
The United States on Wednesday

Jjiik on. Mii., March '.- The
fir-t attempt in override a veto of a
lull by tiovernor Dilhti was made in
the Senate Friday afternoon and it
came so near accomplishing it fur
poxe that one additional affirmative
vote would have pas-ed the bill over
the executive disapproval. The par
ticular bill was that of the support
of the North Mississippi branch agri
cultural experiment station at Holly
Springs which provided for the up
keep of this station for the next two
years. The governor hail vetoed the
till in part; that is, he allowed the
approptiation for 1916 to stand, but
would cut out that for 1917, on the
l round as given that these stations
are useless and unnecessary, and do
not rive adequate return on the
money invested in their upkeep.
I The fight which was parcipitated
over the Senate bill which was intro
duced and discussed on Wednesday,
ami which wound up in a near per
sonal clash between members of the
body, the effect of which would be
, to legislate Land Commissioner M.
1 A. Brown out of office before his
term expires, was settled Friday by
the adoption ami passage of a com
promise measure. This is that while

easy sailing through the Senate.
