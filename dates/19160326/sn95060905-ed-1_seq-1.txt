PUNITIVE EXPIDITIQN HAS L0-
GATED VILLA AND A SMALL '
FORCE NEAR NAMIQUIPA.
i
Gen" Gavira Reports Him in Santa Clara Canyon With a
Bare Chance to Escape; American Aviator Plas
Miraculous Escape: Falls -1000 Feet 1
SOLDIERS SUFFER INTENSELY FROM SOLD, RAIN AND SAND
EL PASO, March 25. -Gen. Garvia stated today
that the American cavalry under Col. Dodd had located
Villa, and his main force in the Santa Clara canyon are
getting close to Villa's rear guard. This statement
revived hope of ending the man hunt. Garvia also said
that Villa had only 200 trooj with him in this place which
is a short distance east of Xamquipa. in a wild, roadless
desert. 'He declared Villi, was nearly surrounded and hic
only avenue of escape was in the easterly end of the can
yon which a force of Carrancistas. who are nearby might
hold, and thus cut off his escape. The Carrancistas and
Americans are co-operating. Besides Col. Dodd's cavalr.
there is a force of American woops north of Cruces near
the Cumbre tunnel and arother force southeast of Casas
Grandes. Gen. Pershing is in foremost command of the
forces near Casas -Grander. Gavira said that a band of
50 Villistas was south of San Lorenzo.
COLUMBUS, March. 25- Narrowly escaping death
after a 165 miles ni'u !' ut. Darque arrived here with
dispatches from correspondents with Gen. Pershing's co
lumn after a two and one-half hour flight. He dropped
4,000 feet when he sir.icK an air pocket in coming
over a pass in the mountains, but saved himslef when
within but 50 feet from earth and glided safely to the
ground. '
I
COLUMBUS, N. M.. March 25. After more than)
a week of marching over the desert south of Columbus, i
and suffering from intense heat and desert dust, more suf
fering was added to the American column when a wind,
storm coming from the Sierra Madres bringing sleet, rain ,
and sand, bore down upon them causing intense suffering,
from cold and depositing sand in the food and baggage. !
It was impossible to see ten feet ahead. A detachment
consisting of 80 American troo'ps are working southwest j
of this point, but no communication has been received
from them owing to the fact that the aeroplanes cannot!
operate in the stiff wind. The Mormons who live in Co-'
Ionia Dublin nearby are furnishing the soldiers with food !
and delicacies for which they are paid a good price.
