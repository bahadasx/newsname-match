held May 19 were completed today.
At tbe last minute Charles E. Lock-
wood, of Portland, designating him'

Other contenders on tbe republi
can side of the Oregon presidential
, preferential primary are Theodore E.
Burton and Albert B. Cummins.
Hughes' petition, bearing 1,300
.names, also waa tiled, but there Is
till some doubt whether his name
will appear on the ballot. Hughes
previously had telegraphed Secretary
of Btate Olcott not to permit the fil
ing of any petition bearing hie name.
Y'S supporters, however, Insisted and
' Olcott yesterday telegraphed Hughes
asking whether he would permit his
-name to go on the ballot. Should he
-still decline, It la probable that bis
supporters will seek a writ of man
Parous to compel Olcott to place his
name on the ballot.
A total of 423 office seekers had
filed for the primaries when the fil
ings closed at 5 o'clook yesterday.
These Included aspirants to state And

RICH ORE FOUND
III SM'ACE CREEK
L1IK PROPERTY
II. M, Parks, director of the state
bureau of mines, who waa In tbe olty
over Saturday, visited tbe mine be
ing developed by Messrs. Joe Shsska
and Wm. Swlnden in the 8avage
oreek district, and waa much Inter
ested In the excellent showing of the
ore body found In the property.
Shank and Swlnden tound tbe vein
upon which they are working nearly
a year ago, and have done consider
able development work. They first
sunk a shaft about 85 feet deep, fol
lowing the lead which had widened
to about four feet at that depth.
They are now driving a tunnel which
will cut the vein at a depth of about
1SS feet when they are In the moun
tain 190 feet. In the bottom of tbe
shaft the ore runs very rich, and Is
In a formation that waa Interesting
to Prof. Parks as being something
out of the ordinary. Tbe free gold
Is carried In a rock that looks and
feels like soft sospstone, which Mr.
Parks terms a green schist. It was
possible to sink the abaft through
this without tbe use of powder, It be
ing easily loosened with tho pick.
Gold' Is plainly visible in much of it,
and at the bottom of tbe abaft It as
says from $40 to f 100 In the precious
metal. The gold-bearing rock Is easi
ly milled, and small pieces picked
at random from the dump and mor
tared out gave high returns In gold.
The tunnel Is now In about 65 feet.
and when the ore body is struck It
Is expected to develop at once into a
real mine. In tracing the find, Messrs.'
8haska and Swlnden found some nug
gets that contained from $1 to $4 in
value, tind they believe that they are(ueen erected at a few points. Captain
on the lead that supplied the Oscar !Crant Boca Grande asked for re-
creek, placer mine with the coarse'
gold and great nuggets that have
made that producer famous. The,'
vein runs north snd south, in a direct
line with the Oscar creek placer on
the other stdo of the divide. Shaska
and Swlnden call the mine the "Blllle'
Blue." '

Report of Secpnd Attack by
Mexicans at ParralbCcs
inned, $500,000 Mining
Mill Being Destroyed
El Paso, April 15. Reported Mexi
can attacks on American property at
Parral were confirmed today by mes
sages received here. Besides news
of the destruction of tbe Alvarado
1500,000 mining mill In a suburb,
local owners of the Parral-Durango
railway received urgent calls for help
from their American manager at
Parral. He stated tbe road'a offices
had been entered and all records de
stroyed. ''
Other American properties are be
lieved to have been wrecked by mobs
enraged over the clash between the
Americana and Mexicans.
Officials of the Alvarado company
demanded protection for their Par
ral property from General Gavlra and
Consul Garcia. The latter Is report
ed to have communicated with Car-
ranta regarding tbe Parral situation
Messages failed to state the atti
tude of , the Cerranaa garrison at Par
ral toward the mob.. Mexicans took
all valuables from the American
warehouse and offices, it waa stated,
El Paso, April 15 Reports ot
fresh troubles at Parral were received
here today by A. J. McQuatters, pres
ident of the Alvarado Mining and
Milling company. The following tele
gram arrived from an employe at
tbe Parral office ot tbe company:
"In retaliation for recent troubles,
armed men yesterday (Thursday) at
noon assaulted the mill, breaking
doors and windows in office, ware
houses and the mill. They robbed
and destroyed. There was another
attack at midnight. They will prob
ably repeat the incident. The mil
ttary knows everything connected
with the affair." r
Consul Garcia, quoting General
Obregon, war minister, stated that
the Parral situation had become quiet
after the fight between American
troops and inhabitants. .
All reports, contradict the stories
of mining men yesterday that Ameri
can troops had taken possession of
Parral. Garcia today received a code
telegram from Chihuahua City, but
it was not made public. His pre
vious advices that one American was
killed and a few Inhabitants wound
ed, remained unchanged today.
SUSSEX WAS HOT
' LIKE MINELAYER
London, April 15. Germany's note
to the United States leaves no further
doubt that the British channel packet
Sussex was torpedoed, the British for
eign office declared today In an offl
clal statement.
A thorough investigation has re
voaled that no vessel In the channel
except the Sussex was damaged in the
manner described by the German sub
marine commander, Furthermore, the
Susaex was attaoked et the exact mo
ment the commander says he hurled
a torpedo at a, British minelayef In
the channel near where the Sussex
was at that time.
Tho ' German stement that the
submarine captain thought that the
ship was one of the new minelayers
ot the Arable type was not Justified,
said the foreign office, because the
Sussex bore no resemblance to vessels '
of the Arabic class.

TOflJWIIIGU
OREGON BALLOT
Salem, April IS. A telegram was
received by Secretary of State Olcott
this morning from Charles E.
Hughes, In which the New Tork
justice stated that he objected to his
name being placed npon the primary
ballot and requesting that action be
withheld until a letter which was on
the road explaining his objections had
been received. This action of Justice
Hughes will probably postpone the ill
lng of the writ of mandamus to com
pel Olcott to place Hughes' name on
the ballot as was proposed by the
Hughes faction in Portland.
Tbe text of Hughes' telegram fol
lows;
"I was Informed on April 11 that
a petition wae about to be filed and
at once mailed to you statement of
my objections and my request that
my name shall not be placed on
primary ballot
"(Signed) Charles E. Hughes."
SAYS THE MILITIA
FUIID WAS WASTED
Washington, April 15. "Federal
appropriations for tbe militia have
been shamefully and disgracefully
wasted sometimes ' embezzled,"
charged Senator Borah today, in at
tacking tbe, Heed . amendment to
Chamberlain's bill increasing militia
offlceYs pay. .
Borah cited the case of the quar
termaster general ot a Texas camp ot
Instruction who,' he alleged, em
bezzled $30,000 and stated that the
largest part of militia funds had
been paid to officers.
. "We may need the militia within
a month," replied Reed. "We should
maintain a national guard of the
highest efficiency. The officers are
the brains of the militia. It funds
have been misappropriated some one
in the war department who permitted
it Is responsible and should be prose
cuted." FROM THE CARDINAL
Brussels, April 15. General von
Biasing, German governor-general of
Belgium, was in receipt today ot a
stinging letter from Cardinal Mer-
cier, Roman Catholic primate of Bel
gium, in reply to the note which von
Biasing sent him warning the prelate
to stop alleged political activity.
"It was not, your excellency may be
sure, without deep reflection that we
denounced to the world the evils with
which our brothers and sisters are
overwhelmed frightful evils Indeed,
atrocious crimes, the tragic horror of
which no cold reason refuses to ad
mit." : ' : ?
In regard to Von Biasing's military
pomp and circumstances, the cardinal
says:
"Allow us then, even smitten as we
are by admiration before the warlike
pomp surrounding ns and the bril
liant staff which, like King Saul, you
have attached to your person, never
theless to retain our full liberty of
Judgment."
