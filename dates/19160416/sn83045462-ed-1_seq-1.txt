President to Consult Leaders of Both ;
Parties in Congress Before Taking
Action Contemplated.
While President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing were engaged
yesterday in marshaling an actunuilation
of evidence that < iernanv
in her submarine waf fare |
ha. violated solemn pledges given
to *he United States, official |
word of two more shipping (lis-1
asters due apparently to illegal j
acts by tierman submarine commanders
wis received at the
State Department.
Consular dispatches indicated
that the steamship Margant Abbey
was attacked without warning
April 8. and that the Aberdeen
bark Inverlyon was sunk by
shelllire after the crew had been
forced to the strull boats more!
than 100 miles from shore. Americans
were aboard both ships and
were endangered.

sion to Berlin early this week.
The President and Secretary Lansing
devoted a large part of the day to the
consideration of the submarine situation.
They had before them a number
of affidavits secured from American
survivors of the Sussex and other
vessels recently attacked, and a number
of documents containing information
forwarded by the British government.
These documents arrived on the
liner St. Paul Friday. They reached
here yesterday.
German Admissions Important.
ft was said the actual value of the
iffidavits had been materially lessened J
by the contents of the German note replying
to the American inquiries. The
affidavits probably would have played
an important part in the indictments if
the administration did not regard the i
German statements about the Sussex |
*s constituting a virtual admission of I
guilt. )
It became known here last night that
the contemplated action of the United
States, which is expected to bring the
submarine controversy to a clear cut
issue, is being watched closely by the
diplomatic representatives of other
neutral nations. The United States is
taking into consideration the case of
many neutral vessels, which, while not
carrying American citizens, have been
sunk by German submarines. An investigation
of these cases has been
proceeding on the ground that it was
only by chance that American citizens
were not aboard the ships when disaster
overcame them.
8ee No Need of Joint Action.
Furthermore, the interests of the j
United States and other neutrals are |
understood to be identical in some ?.f :
the cases. So far. however, the United
States has declined to act jointly w ith |
Other neutrals, not only jri regard to |
the submarine question, but on other
subjects as well. It was saiii las:
flight by a high official of the administration
that the American government
saw* no need for joint action in
the present situation.
It was reiterated last night that before
taking the action contemplated
the President would consult with congressional
leaders. It was indicated
that republicans as well as democrats ;
would be called into the conference. j
French Officials Charge
Premeditated Attack by
Commander of Submarine
PARIS. April 15. ll>:10 p.m. inquiries
of the ministry ?>f marine con( rninir
the ci rrunisf a n<-?? > .f il.i. .?
ta<-k on th?* steamship Sussex have developed
precise information which has;
been given to the Associated I'ress from
authentic sources, as follows:
"This information is not based upon 1
suppositions or probabilities, and in i
'hat it differs from the statement of
Herr von Jagow (Cermati foreign minister).
The facts have been established
by a great number of witnesses whose
names are known, including the cap- i
tain of the Sussex.
Claim Full Knowledge.
"They establish that the .commander '
of the submarine could not have been |
Ignorant that he was attacking a chan- j
nel steamer making regular service |
between France and England. The
route of these steamers differs from
that of other merchantmen and is perfectly
known to all sailors. Moreover,
the route between Dieppe and Folkestone
is essentially the route of ehannel
steamers, which make the journey
<*t a fixed time, and the Sussex was
passing bv the regular route at the
regular time. The commandant of the
submarine therefore knew he was dealing
with ? regular channel steamer.
h?uI it was rlearlv a premeditated attack
against an unarmed channel boat
without the least warning: to permit
passengers ?<? escape.
"It should he remarked that Herr
von'Jagow admits that a (lerman subj
marine sank a steamer at 3:45 o'clock.
and this hour is the Herman equivalent
of l*:5t>. when the Sussex was attacked.
Moreover, Herr von .lagow. by his description.
in fact describes the place
and hour when the Sussex was struck.
He gives even the detail that the forward
part of the how was blown up to
the bridge, which is exactly the condition
of the Sussex.
1
No Other Case Reported.
; "It is impossible to beli; ve in a ro
incidence whereby two ships exactly
jalike should be struck at the same
j hour and the same place. Further- j
! more, no report of any other steamer
being: struck at ihat time and place
lias even been received in France or
England. Herr von' Jagow's description
is therefore a ? ynical admission
of the torpedoing of the Sussex under j
a thin veil of denial.
"The torpedoing of the Sussex is con- !
firmed by sailors of a German sub- I
marine, which was destroyed a few
days after the Sussex attack. Four |
members of the crew of this subtna- I
rine, made prisoners April f?, have ,
been interrogated, and all have confirmed
what was already known, that
the Sussex was torpedoed; and they
have given the name of the command- '
ant and the number of the submarine ]
which attacked the Sussex. These wit- (
nesses seemed to think the entire affair
was known, so they had no hesi- 1
tation in confirming all details of the i
torpedoing of the Sussex by their sis- ,
ter submarine, which cruised in the ,
same locality.
Saw Track of Torpedo.
"Summarizing, the information oh- 1
tained by the ministry of marine
makes certain. that the captain
and other witnesses saw the track of
a torpedo and the captain maneuvered
his ship to avoir! the danger, which
establishes the moral conviction that
the Sussex was torpedoed; second,
fragments of a German torpedo found
on the Sussex add material proof to
the moral conviction; third, the testimony
of prisoners from the German
submarine corroborates completely
both the moral conviction and the materia!
proof, establishing the case, so
far as France is concerned, beyond '
an v doubt."

"I Could Have Blown White House

He Says.
Tilp thrills o?an air raid?thf* purring
[>f ;in aeroplane motor, the sharp reports
of bombs which were hurled
flown ott the city and the blinding
flashes of powerful searchlights that
swept the heavens in search of air

It was the first night "air raid" that
Washington lias ever seen, hut forunately
it was of the "denatured"
sort and the bombs that burst in air

Those who were in the downtown

sations that have fallen to the lot ?>f

cities of Europe since the outbreak of j

tagcd with a view of accelerating i
entinient for aerial preparedness
mong members of Congress and govrnment
officials. It was the first time
in extensive night flight was made by
;ii aeroplane in this locality.
Considerable Excitement.
The flight was made by Aviator
>elJoyd Thompson in a biplane, a Day
rartor powered with a Gyro motor, an
nvention of Emile Berliner of this
ity. Only a few persons knew that
he flight was to he made, and accordngly
there was considerable exciter.ent
in the downtown section of the
ity when the sharp, quick explosions
if an aeroplane was heard overhead
.nd the sharp reports o? bursting
'bombs'*, came at intervals*'" of every
minute or so.
Che machine went up from the polo
iCd in Potomac Park. Attached to it

Explodes First Bombs.
When Mr. Thompson was over the
Var College, at an altitude of about
1.000 feet, he set off the first of the
tombs, which exploded with a report
ls loud as a cannon. There was a
lash when the bombs exploded and iin- j
nediately the searchlights were direct - i
d a.t that point iti the heavens. Clouds
f smoke, resembling huge balls of cot- j
bn. which were made by the bombs, j
were plainly seen when rays from the
earchlights centered upon them. Apparently
the searchlights were unable j
o keep the machine in their rays.
From the War College Mr. Thompson j
urned northeastward and soon was
>ver the t'apitol. Another bunch of '
lombs were set oft. and then he headed j
ip town and theoretically destroyed the !
Vhite House and the government j
uilding adjacent to it. A magnesium j
lare was then lighted, and. with a tail
.f white fire like that of a comet !
treaming behind him. Mr. Thompson j
ooped the loop and performed other i
ierial gymnastics.
While this was going on his associates
had arranged a line of red lights
lown the center of the polo field to
juide him when he alighted. Mr.
Thompson cut off his motor when high
n the air and glided down. His landng
was done with such precision that
several hundred motorists and others
vho had been attracted to Potomac
ark loudly applauded the aviator and
ushed up to shake hands with him
,vhen he climbed out of his machine.
Great Destruction Possible.
"The bombs were of the kind used in
rework1:."' said Mr. Thompson. "They
exploded about ) .<?< ?? feel above the
rround and ".00<i feet lower than my
nachinc. Had I used real explosives
>f the deadly order 1 could have blown
he White House and ?'apitol off the
nap.
"I dropped a number of excelsiorilled
'warning bombs' over the resilential
and business sections, and
iiHiiv of them will Ire found tomorrow.
"Aerial attack is the only danger we
>penly invite by total uiipreparedness.
s.'ot a single anti-aircraft, gun is in the
tntire country. I am going to 'raid'
ibout twenty cities in the I'n ited States

get through I am sure the country
will be aroused to preparedness in

Uhargcs were brought early in 1914 |

LONDON. April 15.?On the eastern
front sharp fighting; is going on between
Austrian and Russian forces for
positions on the lower Stripa and the
Dniester river, in Oalicia, and for others
northeast of Czernowitz, iti Buko<vina.
During the fighting Wednesday night .
at Trzibouchovtze Austrians armed not |
only with rifles and bayonets, but with
daggers, approached Russian trenches.
They threw away their rifles and
raised their arms, crying out that they
surrendered. When they reached closet
quarters with the czar's troops they
used their daggers and fierce hand-tohand
fighting ensued.
Following is the official statement issued
today at Austro-Hungarian headquarters:
"Seven enemy aeroplanes, among
which were four battleplanes, appeared
over Czernowitz. Several Austro-Hungarian
fliers arose and gave battle and,
after a combat of two hours in the air,
shot down one battle plane at a distance
of thirty feet. The enemy squadron
then fled. A damaged aeroplane
landed near Boyan, between the Rus->
sian and our lines. It was destroyed J
by Austro-Hungarian artillery fire.

leaving their arms at. the camp outside
the town, entered to buy food. They
were fired upon and retreated in the
direction of the camp. Troops there
moved forward to meet the Mexicans,
who were pursuing the retreating!
troops, and began a sharp fire, killing J
forty Mexicans. Xo mention of wound- j
ed either of tlm Americans or the Mexicans
was made.
The \mericans were a detachment of j
the'loth Cavalry, and it was indicated '
that they were commanded by Col.
W. C. Hrown.
Willing to Negotiate Withdrawal, j
President Wilson has decided to inform |
Hen. Carranza. in response to his request!
for withdrawal of the American troops
'fhpm Mexico, that the United States will I
negotiate for an agreement along these j
lines:
The United States government is will-J
jug to agree to fix a limit on the distance 1
the American troops now in pursuit of
Villa shall proceed into Mexico ami to ! '
make that limit not much farther south j
than the troops already have proceded. j
The United States government is willing I 1
to give assurances that the American '
troops will he withdrawn within "a rea- J
sonable time.'' or as soon as it is defi- J j
nitelv established that Villa has reached I
a point where be can be dealt with better '
by the Carranza forces.
These points, it became known last
night. were discussed fully at Friday's !
cabinet meeting. The I 'resident's advisers j
are said to have agreed on such a course i
in the belief that it would make stronger I
the chances of catching Villa. A r. ply t<> ; r
Men. Carranza is said to t?e virtually
completed and is expected to go forward j '
in a very short time. j '
I t
Villa Pursuit Will Continue.
Meantime the pursuit ' of Villa by the!6
American troops will continue. Secretary J:l
Baker sharply outlined this yesterday ini;i
a formal statement. 1
"The status of the expedition into Alex- *
ieo is as it was|tt the beginning, in cor- '
dial co-operation with the de facto goveminent
of Mexico." he said. "That cooperation
continues and the expedition '
continues. There has been no change in t
the orders and none is in contemplation." d
Secretary Baker ami other officials
laid stress on the fa?t that co-opera- j
lion of the Carranza troops was re- j
trarded as an important element, and 0
the negotiations for an agreement with
the de facto government will be con- j
lueted with the idea that such an L
agreement would strengthen Carranza -i
it home, and at the same time make
in* task of catching Villa easier. j
The lines of communication of the I
America 11 troops following Villa, al- I
ready have been lengthened to the point j
where sending supplies has become I
difficult: is realized here that it |
would he extremely hazardous foe.
Lhem to go much further.
To Treat Parral Clash Separately.
Secretary Lansing has planned to
leal with the Parral incident as enirelv
a separate matter from the negoLiations
growing out of the request v
for withdrawal of the American troops.
Sen. Carranza's charge that the j ||
American commander violated his orlers
and sought to occupy the town is f
? serious one, and officials believe it
?rew out of imperfect knowledge of
a* hat had transpired. Inofficial re- T
>orts reaching the border seem to conirm
tl?at view, stating that not only h
,vas no attempt made to occupy the c
town, but that unarmed American sol- r
liers. seeking only to purchase sup- jj
dies. were the victims of the attack. c

Force of 1,000 Too Small.
Announcement by Carranza officials of
the close limil?^tQ.they wilt seek
to have future extfedlflonu across th*?
border confined serves to show the probable
course of the negotiations for the
withdrawal of the American forces. Officials
say it would have been manifestly
impossible for a thousand cavalrymen
to accomplish anythng whatever lu
checking border raids.
There are indications that the American
note will contend that the present
expedition is necessarily outside any
such proposal as that suggested by
(!en. Carranza. since it had for its purpose
the crushing of an organized and
numerous force of bandits, not the pursuit
and punishment ??f a marauding
band of cattle thieves.
It is possible, also, that the American
reply will lay stress on the fact
that (Jen. Carjanza himself has ascribed
to Villa no other purpose in his border
operations than to precipitate a
clash between the I'nited Stales and
the de facto government. 1'nder these
circumstances, it will be argued, tin
I'nited States was compelled to protect/^
itself from incursions umi.nntino i..
minor military invasion*.
The condition was recurrent and intolerable
to the I,'nited States, it will
be pointed out if this view is follower!
up. and made it neeessary lor the
Washington government to go to tinaid
of its neighbor state with an expedition
of su?-h size and scope as to
make certain that joint operations
would accomplish what the de facto
government forces had been unable t"
do alone.
