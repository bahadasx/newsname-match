COMMONWEALTH A FEW SOCIALISTS
EXTENSION
IE
CHANGES
President Hicks Will Assume
Entire Charge; Other
Transfers
Several important changes in the
management and operation of the
Commonwealth Extension mine have
' taken place in the last few days, and
it begins to look as if the extension
was rapidly approaching that point
whtre they will be milling and ship
ping ore.
President C W Hicks who has
, been developing the property ever
s.nce he left Tombstone, will now
assume entire charge of the business
and office end of the lompan), and in
addition to his other duties will assume
jlhe Secretar)ship ol the company.
I thus gixing bis entire time to that end
I of the compjti) alTairs
1
During Mr. Hicks' sta) at Pearce.
, he has made a very fine showing, aad
now that the affairs of the company
have reached that point where the
office and executive end of the affair
need a practical man Mr Hicks is
j the proper man to look after that end
'of it
I
f Another change that was necessarv
at this Mage of the companies welfare
was the selection of a capably practi
cat man to take charge of the surface
and underground workings and in
that selection, the company has been
most fortunate in securing of "Jack"
Metcalfe recently with the Cananea
mites and at one time in the employ
of the old Commonwealth at Pearie
for over five years. His selection is
particularl) gratifying to the stock
hvlders and directors, because of his
intimate knowledge of the localit)
Another drill of the most improved
pattern has been added to the cqnp
mrnt and work will be pushed to the
utmost. Another man, who has been
connected with the Extension, and
who is confident of the final outcome
of the property, is J N. Penberthy,
who for the last )ear or ttwo has been
the consulting engineer.
It is said that the old Common
wealth people have arranged to run a
drift into their property from the.
Rainbow shaft of the Extension and
are already at work on it This will
be of great benefit to both companies.
Several ore showings have been open
ed up in the rainbow shaft of the Ex
tension will be connected at once
which means a great advantage in the
way of air, shipping, getting nd of
waste and for the complete operation
and exploration of the property
The Extension has ten claims of what
may be termed practicall) undevelop
ed property with the mast encourag
ing surface showings and excellent
results in the Rainbow workings
NO MORE

: PHOENIX
A Union Alan Tells of the
Mpeting in Arizona Re
publican Columns
A few das ago the word was sent
out from Phoenix that tbre had been
a great rally of the union labor mem
bers in Phoenix for the purpose of or
ganizing a club for the support of Sir
Galahad Hunt. The following from a
Phoenix union man was published in
the Arizona Republican giving the facts
about the organization and results ot
this meeting
To the Editor of the Republican
Sir There have been reports of a
meeting railed by the wage earners of
Maricopa rounty to orgamre a Hunt
club epeciall) among union men. oth
ers invited It has been claimed that
it was a representative demand of the
working men
Who were the people that wen: re
sponsible for this meeting ' One has
b'en an active socialist, one or two
others Republican and some of the
others have been sliding from one par
ty to the other and never knew where
they belonged. One or two may have
been democrats but have never been
active.
The official organ of organized labor
was used to advertise this meeting and
two notices were printed on different
days in the Arizona Republican urging ,
the union men to attend this meeting
and bring their families and friends
and organize a Hunt club.
The meeting was held and a wonder
ful success (') it was. There are be
tween 50U and 1,000 union men in
Phoenix. )et this auspicious gathering
was composed of less than 40 people
and several of these were the most ac
tive soialists in the state and have
been on tbat ticket for vinous offices
at the different election in the past ten
years. How many of those present
were simply there for curiosity to see
how many would turn out and what
assimne course those so styled and ad
vertised representatives of the wage
workers would take of course we can
not say.
A report of the meeting designated it
as mass meeting. What is a mass meet
ing? It stated a recess was taken to
give those present an opportunity to
sign the membership roll but does not
say how many signed.
If all the mass meetings to form
Hunt clubs throughout the state are
as successful as this one Geo. W, P.
Hunt will be eliminated as a factor in
Arizona politics at the primary.
