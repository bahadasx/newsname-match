That the French troops defending.
the fortress of Verdun have launched1
a vigorous counter attack in the re
gion of Deadman's Hill, on. the west
hank of the Meuse, was disclosed by
the official , report issued Saturday
afternoon from the German army
headquarters.
The attack followed violent artillery
preparation and was directed against
the German positions south of Cor
heaux wood, in the Cumieres wood
and on Deadman's Hill.
Though line after line of French
troops were mowed down, the Ger
man statement says by the artillery
fire of ' the Germans, some F'rench
battalions succeeded in penetrating
the Teuton's position on Deadman's
Hill. On gaining a footing in the
trenches there, however, Berlin de
clares, they were slain in bayonet
fighting.
Paris officially is silent regarding
this battle, the afternoon statement
announcing that French batteries had
evidenced great activity on the west
bank of the .Meuse, particularly to
the west of Corbeaux wood and along
Forges Brook, and that no infantry
engagements had taken place.
The latest official statement issued
at Paris fails to mention any activity
y the French infantry- Both east
and west of the Meuse .there have
been artillery bombardments only.
On the eastern front sharp fight
ing is going on between Austrian
and Russian forces for positions on
the lower Stripa and the Dneister
river in Galicia, and for others north
east of Czernowitz, in Bukowina.
In the Italian theater, the Italian
and Austrian armies have respectively

WASHINGTON April 15. While
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing today were engaged in marshall
ing the accumulation of evidence that
Germans' In hei Submarine had violated
solemn pledges given to the United
Slates, official word of two more ship
ping disasters, apparently due to il
legal acis by German submarine com
manders, was received at the state
department. Consular dispatches in
dicated that the steamship Margam
Abbey was attacked without warning
on April 8 and that the Inverlyon was
sunk by shell fire after the crew had
been foicec" to the small boats more
than 100 miles from shore Americans
were aboard both ships and were en
dangered. These two cases ar being investi
gated and may be included in the Am
erican indictment of German methods
of conducting submarine warfare
which it was understood tonight prob-
tbly would be ready for transmission
to Berlin earlv nexi week.
The president and Secretary Lansing
devoted a large part of the day to the
consideration of the submarine situa
tion. They had before tnem a num
ber of affidavit- secured from Ameri
can Ri:r ivors of the Sussex and other
vessels lecently attacked and a num
ber of documents containing informa
tion lorwarded by the British govern-
mnni Tlioo .Linnmfints "irrive.1 nn the'
liner St. Paul yesterday. They reach
ed here this afternoon.
It was said the actual value of af
fidavits had been materially lessened
by the contents of the German note
reph ing to the American inquiries. The
affidavits probably v. ould have played
nr. important part in the indictment
if the administration did not regard
the German statements of the Sussex
as constituting a virtual admission ol
guilt.
It uecame known here tonight that
the contemplated action of the I'nited
Str.tes which is expected to bring the
submarine controversy to a clear cut
isf-ue is being watched closely by the
diplomatic representatives of other neu-
aal nations. The I'nited States is tak
ing into consideration the case of many
'neutral vessels which, while not carry
ing American citizens, have been sunk
by German submarines. An investi
gation of these cases has been pro
ceeding on the ground that it was only
by chance that American citizens were
not :iboa"'i1 the ships when the dis
aster overcame them.

Note on Santandreno

It is evident that the submarine
war carried on by Germany, in reply
to the war of extermination and
famine declared on her by England,
may injure the interests of neutrals,
but only in rases where the inter
ests are exercised in favor of Ger
many's enemies under the form of
the dispatch of contraband of war.
"There Is nothing to prove that it
was a German war vessel which tor
pedoed the Santandreno. The Ger

the case as soon as possible.

on Parral Affair in Which
Two American Soldiers
Were Killed
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAX ANTONIO, Tex.. April 15. It
was an "unprovoked attack" on un
armed soldiers, who had entered Par
ral merely to purchase supplies, that
precipitated an action between Mex
icans and Americans there Wednes
day, according to an official report
received today from General Pershing.
His report was the first official
news that has been received of the in
cident which drew from Carran.a the
urgent recommendation that the
American troops be withdrawn and,
though brief, it confirmed ihe report
sent bv Consul Letcher from Chihua
hua Thursday.
General Pershing sent his report in
duplicate from Satevo, 0 miles north
west of Parral. It appeared that he
did not receive a report from the
troops yet in the vicinity of Parral
until today and that upon its receipt
he forwarded hi report to General
Funston immediately.
He .said that a part of tile soldiers.
leaving their arms at the camp out-
ide the town, entered to buy food.
They were fired upon and retreated
the direction of the camp. The
troops there moved foiward to meet
the .Mexicans, who were pursuing the
retreating troops and began a sharp
fire, killing forty Mexicans.
He ieports the American dead as
two. No mention of wounded either
of the Americans or the Mexicans
was made.
The Americans were a detainment
of the 10th -avalry and it was in
lUc iled that they were commanded by
Colonel V. C. Brown.
General Pershing said he had dis
patched additional troops in the di
rection of Parral. but General Fun
ston withheld for military reasons
thai part of the information relating
to what units were being used and
the exact disposition although he inti
mated that he regarded as satisfac
tory the orders General Pershing had
issued.
General Funston did not regard
General Pershing's report wholly
satisfactory, however, because of its
treaty. He sunt him a message to
night asking liim to amplify it is
quickly as possible. Whether the at
tack on the men who went int Par
ral wits made by residents or by sol
diers or whether liy both, was not
staled, a.nd n", mention was made of
any assistance given bv the Mexican
troops in tin supressioM of rioters or
in the restoration of order.
One cop..- of the report was sent
through Consul Letcher at Chihua
hua to the state department in code.
This was sent from Chihuahua over
the wires in control of the Mexican
government. The duplicate was taKen
to Namiquinn by aeroplane and from
there passe. over the field wire that
General Pershing has set up from
there to his base at Columbus. Since
the report passed over that wire late
this afternoon it was cut.
General Pershing did not indicate in
his report that any fresh news as to
the whereabouts of Villa had been
received although it is understood he
told of the continued advances of cav
alry detachment who nr" yet forcing
their way along mountain trails in
the neighborhood of Parral.
A few additional troops have been
sent into Mexico from Columbus but

today and precautionary measures to

Two private messages received here
today from I'arral served to allay in
some degree the apprehension which
has grown steadily deeper with every
hour's coniiroied silence on the part of
general Funston and Washington.
One message was received by an
Englishman with large mining inter
ests in I'arral. It was from his wife
and merely said his family was well
and that there was no cause for worry.
The second message was received by
I he American head of another Parral
mining company and said conditions
were gradually becoming more tran
quil. At the same time unofficial re
ports from Mexican .sources were more
gloomy than at any time since the first
news of the fighting was made public
by General Obregon. One of these
reports was brought by a Mexican su
perintendent of a Parral mining plant.
He declared that fif. hud positive
knowledge that the fighting at Parral
had been on a very large scale. A re
port was made to his American em
ployer who said that the man had
worked for him for twenty years and
that he had usually the utmost confi

fered by American soldiers were co-incident

Republican A. P. Leasee? Wire
WASHINGTON, April 15.
President Wilson has decided to
inform General Carranza, in re
sponse to his request for with
drawal of the American troops
from Mexico, that the United
States will negotiate for an
agreement along these lines:
The United States government
is willing to fix a limit on the
distance of American troops now
in pursuit of Villa shall proceed
into Mexico, and to make that
limit not much further south
than the troops already have
proceeded.
The United States government
is willing to give assurance that
the American troops will be
withdrawn within "a reasonable
time," or as soon as it is defin
itely established that Villa has
reached a point where he can be
dealt with better by the Car
ranza forces.
These points, it became known to
night, were discussed fully at yes
terday's cabinet meeting. The presi
dent's advisers are said to huvo
'airreed on such a course in the e-
jef thut u wauU make stronger the-
cnfl
inces of catching Villa. A reply
to General Carranza is said to be vir
tually completed and is expected to
go forward in a very short time.
Meantime the pursuit of Villa by
the American troops will continue.
Secretary Baker sharply outlined this
today in n formal statement.
"The status of the expedition into
Mexico is as it was at the beginning,
in cordial co-operation with the do
facto government of Mexico," ho
said. "That co-operation continues
and the expedition continues. Ther
has been no change in the orders anil
none is in contemplation."
Secretary Baker and other offi
cials laid stress on the fact that the
co-operation oi i..n, i.wi
regarueu as an inipoiiaui eieineui.
and the negotiations for an agree
ment with the de facto government
will be conducted with the idea that
such an agreement would strengthen
Carranza at home, and at the same
time make the task of catching VilU
easier.
The lines of communication of the
American troops following Villa al
ready have been lengthened to the
point where sending supplies has be
come difficult, and it is realized here
that it would be extremely hazardous
for them to go much farther.

General Pershing's message, giving
virtually the same information regard
ing the fight as previously had come
from unofficial, sources, was regarded
j at the war department as disposing of
sensational border rumors magnifying
the incident. The reference to General
Herrera, Carranza's commander at Chi
huahua was accepted as further dem
onstrations the extent to which the
American and de facto forces were co
operating. Although the message did
not so specifically state, officiuls took
it for granted that the attack on th
Americans was made by civilians, since
any hostile move by Carranza troops
would have called for a definite state
ment by General Pershing to that effect.
