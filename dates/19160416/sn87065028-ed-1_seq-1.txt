PEBCEPTIE INCREASE
LOCAL POSTOFFICE RECEIPTS
THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH
31, SHOWS GAIN OVER SAME
PERIOD LAST YEAR.
The receipts of the local postof
fice for the quarter ending March
31, 1916, were $7,205.30 against
$1,479.25 for the same period in
1915, showing a gain of $726.05.
This revenue was derived from the
sale of stamps, newspaper postage
and box rents, and does not include
the money order business handled
by the office.
Postal receipts are regarded ev
erywhere as a good business barom
eter, and the increase shows that
conditions are improving. Postmas
ter Sharp is naturally very much
gratified with the splendid showing
and hopes that there will be a cor
resopnding increase during the suc
ceeding quarter.
