f the
No Change Contemplated
Washington, D. C, April 15. Sec
retary Lansing pronounced the Mex
ican situation as unchanged in any re
spect today, unless the official report
of. the Parral incident discloses a
more grave situation. There is noth-
me iu muicaie any inaiiKf mucin ue
pected in the near future. Because
lack of information from Par
ral, official's here are inclined to
doubt that the clash was as serious as
at first reported.
Secretary of War Baker late today
issued the following statement: "The
Unifed States expedition into Mexico
is as it was at the beginning, in cor
dial co-operation with the de facto
government. There has been no
change either in purpose or orders,
and- nore is contemplated.
Worried by Pershing's Silence
San Antonio, Texas, April 15. Gen

caused some uneasiness and impa

it was occasioned more by what may
(By Dr. J. W. Burns)
The big tabernacle at the corner
of Broadway and C streets, north
west, was dedicated with appropriate
ceremonies Friday evening, the ser
vice beginning at 7:30 o'clock. Al
though it -was raining, a good-sized
congregation was in attendance. Al
most one hundred voices were in the
chorus at the first service. Each
singer was given a number, corres
ponding to the number of his chair,
which is to be retained during the
entire meeting.
The tabernacle is dry and warm.
The roof is of rubberoid and did not
leak during the rain of Friday night
and Saturday morning. The seats
are constructed for comfort, and
there is no reason why anyone should
not be perfectly at ease in the con
gregation. The electric lights install
ed give much brilliancy to the in
terior of the structure. Beautiful
decorations have been provided and
will adorn the auditorium today. Also
mottoes will be used on the walls,
suggestive of the meaning of the
revival.
Rev. M. B. Williams, the evangelist,
will preach both morning and even
ing today'. He is in fine shape and
expects to deliver interesting and
instructive sermons from the very be
ginning. The churches and pastors
of the city are working with might
and main to make a big success of
the revival. Co-operation on the part
of all is very noticeable, and a sub
ject of comment on every hand.
At the dedicatorial services, Fri
day evening, each pastor of the city
participated, either in prayer or ad
dress. Optimism was manifested on
every hand, and a full consecration
to the Lord was offered. The big
choir begins as if it had practiced
for weeks. Prof. Bray says that it
acts as a well trained chorus, and
that he never began a meeting with
better prospects for good singing
and music. Prof.. Bray and wife
began the meeting at their best. Mrs.
Bray is great at the instrument, and

GOOD ATTENDANCE.
At the Southeastern Track and Ed
ucational meet held at Durant, the
schools of Carter county were well
represented, and carried otT their
share of the honors.
The Ardmore High School Orches
tra, under the direction of Sol Low
enstein, carried off first prize, over
strong competition, and brought the
silver cup to this city.
The spelling team, representing
this county, consisting of Edward,
Kati and Pearl Fisher, and James
Sullivan of Lone Grove, and Essie
Snow of Wilson, won first honors,
and the five gold medals for indi
vidual members. Rowland Kennedy
of Ardmore, a member of the Fresh
man class of the Ardmore High
school, won first prize in declamation.
Mrs. A. A. Rogers, one of the teach
ers in the New Wilson schools, and
whose husband is principal there, was
here yesterday en route home, from
Durant, and she was very much en

RAIN WAS GENERAL OVER THIS
SECTION AND IS SERIOUSLY IM
PEDING FARM WORK OIL
FIELD SOAKED.
The rainfall of Friday night and
yesterday morning added six Inches
of water in the city lake, and the
water Is now nearly to the top of
the (spillway. Engineer Carlock stated
yesterday morning that in his opinion
there is no immediate danger to the
dam, although the necessary repairs
would be made as rapidly as possible.
The opening In the cone at the top
of the spillway proper Is rapidly re
lieving the pressure, as well as the
escape valve at the loot of the dam,
and it is the opinion of the engineer
that the citizens may rest assure!
that the lake is secure, unless some
thing unforseen happens.
The rain of Friday night was gen
eral over this entire section, and re
ports from the oil fields state that
there was a veritable flood there
which seriously impedes work. Farm
ers throughout this section are com
plaining, and work is seriously ham
pered on the farm. It is estimated
that sixty per cent of the corn crop
will have to be- replanted in this
section and that the condition of
the ground will seriously impede
The finished plans tire being drawn
for the new Presbyterian church to
be erected In this city, and according
to the preliminary plans, will be the
handsomest church edifice in the
city. '
P. D. Maxwell, who is chairman of
the building committee, states that
he hopes to have work on the new
church begun within six months af
ter the beginning. The plans call
Heavy artillery exchanges
continue before Verdun, but
the German infantry has not
returned to the assault.
The chief point of the Ger
man trims is still Hill Number
301.
Increased activity on the Ga
lician front is indicated in the
Austrian war statement. Along
the lower Strina there have
been several brisk engagements
for advanced positions.
Varying successes for the
Austrians and Italians are re
ported from the intense fight
ing on the Isonzo front.
The French infantry assaults
against the German lines at
Deadman's Hill, launched yes
terday, after violent artillery
preparations, were repulsed
with heavy losses, a German
statement says today.
French Troops In Readiness.
London, April 15. Except for the
artillery wings of the contending ar
mies, there has been no fighting at
for a beautiful interior, as well as a any point on the long front In Franco
magnificent exterior, and will have a
seating capacity of five hundred. The
choir and pipe organ, ns in all mod
ern churches, will be behind the
pulpit.
Mr. Maxwell has been looking over
various plans that have been sub
mitted, and has finally decided upon
one adopted as being best suited to
the needs of the congregation in this
city. A detailed description of the
building would be hard to give by
other than a trained architect, but
the citizens of Ardmore can rest
issured that an edifice will be erected
that everyone, regardless of religious
belief, can be justly proud of.

and Belgium.
Several days now have elapsed since
the Germans launched a heavy attack
on the positions in dispute before Ver
dun, but their artillery has continued
vigorously to shell the Lo Mort Homme
sector northwest of Verdun and the
second-line position of the French east
of the Meuse.
The French in the former sectors are
still answering with their big guns the
German fire and constantly holding
themselves iu readiness for tne infan
try attack that usually succeeds pre
paratory bombardments.
In the Argonne the French continue
to operate with their guns against Ger
man points of vantage and in the re
gion of Pont a-Mouson they have shell
ed convoys of Germans.
