in the region of Dead Man's Hill, ac
cording to Berlin. The attack, fol
lowing violent artillery preparation,
wns directed against the German posi
tions south of Corbeaux and Cumiares

COLOR FAMINE LIKEKLY
TO CAUSE CAMPAIGN FOR
ONLY WHITE APPAREL j
' r - . *#1
Atlanta, April 15.-Dry goods mer
chants in Allunta und thioughout the
southern states may econ start a
campaign in. thc interest of white
wearing apparel. Milady will have
to forego dyed fabrics. The color fa
mine, uccordlng to reports received]
here, has reached alarming propor-1
Hons.
it nov; appears that despite thc
best efforts of tho American dyestuffs
Industry, persons generally will nao
to get along with less color in wear
ing apparel effects,' while au addi
tional deprivation to bo encountered
probably, within a few weeks will ibo
tho circumstance thuct retail stores
will no longer he in u position to
warrant many fabrics us dyed with
lasting colors.
In short, as pointed out yesterday]
by wholesale * and retail dry goods]
men, the embargo on German dye
stuffs ns a result or the European I
wnr has at last reached tito point
where the ultimate consumed will bo j
called upoo to oxerciBo patience, and I
an unusual degree with bis trades
man when it comes to purchasing nil
sorts of wearing apparel, house Citr
nishingB and all arttcleB of every dny|
HBO in into which color enters
. ILatB now being shown In Atlanta
for the coiuing season are refieciing
the color scarcity and are made In
light shades, particularly grays and
natural mixtures of furs requiring no
dyes. Soft hats which can bc made
In tho lighter and natural colorings
willi, say Atlanta dealers, supplant
very largely the derby hat, for which
dyes are necessary. '
The ramifications of tho dyestuffs |
shortage will probably be felt in the '?
laundries, as Atlanta laundrymen
havo received advices urging |
them to exert pressure on customers
to make as wide use as possible of|
white goods the next few month:?.
