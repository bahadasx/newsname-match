Doctor Ki.shop spoke on the cause,

the "great American sport," and
mentioned that in 1915 the record of
deaths by mob violence fell below the
average, there being G9 lynchings. 67
of which occurred in the south. "The
prevalence of mob violence,' he de
clared, "has dulled the public con

"Mob violence Is anarchy In Its re

The eradication of mob violence, he

A plea for co-operation by white

by Mishop liratton. "The prosperity
of the south." he declared, "Is de

OKLAHOMA CITY. April 15 For
the purpose of discussing plans
and arranging some definite system

II. Geissler, chairman of the slato
Republican committee, has called a
meeting of the committee to be held
at the Sklrvin hotel on Saturday,
April 22, at 1:30 o'clock. Ihe state
chairman especially urges that every
member of the committee bo present,
and In addition to the members of the
state committee, chairman of county
central committees and every Repub
lican who desires Is Invited to attend
the meeting. It is very probable that
at the meeting of the state committee
arrangements will be made for hold
ing meetings of. the county central
committees of each county during the
following week.
It is considered of the utmost Im
portance for committeemen and all
party workers to seo that every Re
publican eligible to vote should be
registered, and the only way to do
this is for the voter to present him
self to the registrar and see that his
name Is properly placed on the rolls.
According to the registration ' law,
anyone who voted at the election of
1914 la entitled to register, or would
be automatically registered, but the
Republicans are going to take no
chances this time and will leave
nothing to be taken for prranted, es
pecially from the opposing party and

The entire registration proposition
will be- discussed at the meeting of

Important matters to be considered,

GUARD OFFICERS TO
DRAW $500 YEARLY
Guardsmen Must Also Take
Oath to Obey President,
Senate Provides.
ARE ARMY MEASURES
Amendment Introduced to
Provide Schools to Train
Reserve Officers.
WASHINGTON. April 15. Two
more provisions designed to
strengthen the federal status of the
nationul guard were put Into the sen
ate army bill today. In the course of a
debate enlivened by charges that fed
eral funds provided the national
guard In past years had been thrown
away foolishly and in some cases em
bc.i:led, the senate adopted amend
ments providing that all officers of
the guard above the rank of captain
be paid $500 a year by the federal
government und that all guardsmen
on enlistment be required to take an
oath to obey orders from the presi
dent as well as the governor of their
respective states.
The attack on guard officers for
their use of federul funds was made
by Senator lioruh In a speech oppos
ing the Reed amendment for federal
protection. The Idaho senator de
clared the $S, 000, 000 available an
nually for use of the guard under the
Dick militia law had been "shamo
fully" utilized by officers to the ex
clusion of enlisted men and that
some of it had been "embezzled."
.Senutors Reed, Pomereno and others
defended the guardsmen and the fed
eral pay amendment was adopted.

his request tor withdrawal of tho

agreement along these lines:

Mexico and to make that limit not
much lurtlier south than tho troops

The Cuiied Slates government is
willing to give assurances that tho
American troops will be withdrawn
within "a reasonable time," or as soon
as it is established definitely that Villa
has reached a point where he can be
dealt with better by tho Carranza
lorces.

Secretary Hakcr sharply outlined
this today In a formal statement.
"The sta'us of the expedition Into
Mexico Is as it was at the beginning,

"Thut co-operation continues and the

the negotiations for an agreement

The lines of communication of the
American troops following Villa nl

point where sending supplies has be

that It would be extremely hazardous
for them to go much further.
No military dispatches were given
