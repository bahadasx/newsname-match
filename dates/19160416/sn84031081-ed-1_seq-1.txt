El Paeo, Tex., April in. A report I
on the Parral clash was sent through
lu re today to Washington by Consul I
1 tchcr, of Chihuahua, a copy being

eminent officials here who saw this,
u pon refused to discuss It. It was
Intimated, however, thnt the number i
of American dead was not over five, ,
while one hundred Mexicans were
cither dead or wounded.
Two private messages received here
today served to alluy In some degree
the apprehension which has grown,
steadily deeper with every hour's con
tin tied silence on the part of General (
Pun.ton and Washington. j
No Cause to Worry.
One message was received by an i
I'nslishmaii with large mining inter-j
tereata in Parral. it was from his.
wife and merely said his family was!
well and that there was no cause fori
worry. The second message was re-j
ceived by the American head of an-
ther Parral mining concern and said 1
condition, were gradually becoming
more tranquil. At the same time un
official reports from Mexican sources
were more gloomy than at any time
.since the first news of the fighting !
wus made public by General (tbregon. I
une of these reports was brought by !
a Mexican superintendent of a Patrol i
mining plant. He declared that he
had positive knowledge that the fight-j
ins ut Parral had been on a very large

American f.. - iia. '" n o Iped out.

given to
the United States, official w ord of two
more shipping disasters, apparently
due to Illegal acts by German subma

state department. C.nsular dispatches
indicated that the steamship Margam

the submarine controversy to a clear

Paris, April 10. Inquiries of the

I Olae Inlormalion which has been glv
en to the Associated Press from au

"Ttlll information is nut based upon

minister).

"The facts have been established
thnt the commander of the submarine
could not have been ignorant that he
was attacking a channel steamer. The
route of these steamers differs from
that of other merchantmen and is
perfectly known lo all sailors, More
over, the route from Dieppe and
Folkestone Is essentially ihe route of
channel steamers which make the
journey at a fixed lime, and llie Sus

The commander of th" submarine
therefore knew he was dealing with
a regular channel stemnei i.nd it was
clearly a premeditated act against an
unarmed channel boai without the

"It should be remarked that Herr
