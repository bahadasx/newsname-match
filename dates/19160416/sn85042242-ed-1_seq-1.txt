MEANWHILE, STATUS
Caii.net Considers Matter.
The points, it became known to­
night, were discussed fully at yes
lerday's cabinet meeting. The presi­
dent's advisers are said to have
agreed on such course in the bc
lie.l'i,that it would make stronger the
chnwes of capturing Villa. The re
pl.Ma Ueneral Carranza is said to be
virtually completed and is expected In
go forward in a. very j.liort lime.
.Meantime, the pursuit of Villa by
the American troops will continue.
Secretary linker sharply outlined this
today in a formal statement.
"The status of the expedition into
(Mexico is as it was at the beginning
in cordial co-operation with the de
facto government of Mexico," he
said. "That co-operation continue:!,
and the expedition continues. There
has been no chage in the orders and
lioe is contemplation."
Need Carranza Troops.
Secretary Raker and other officials
laid stress on the fact that co-opera­
tion of the Carranza troops was re­
garded as :pi important element'and
the negotiations for lin agreement
with the de facto government will be
conducted with the idea that such
an agreement would strengthen Car­
ranza at home, and at the siime lime
make the task of capturing Villa
easier. S
An unconfirmed report today of a
second attack on the Americans near
Parral caused uneasiness in some
quarters. Secretary Halter shares the
hope that, failure to receive an of­
ficial report thus far indicates that
the. A^neric^ji ppttljpander considered
the incident to be without any broad
significance.
iReports Exaggerated.
"I still hope," Secretary E'aker said,
"that reports of the Parral incident
are exaggerated that it will prove
to have been local and accidental
and that there will be no further con­
sequences of any kinds."
There are indications that the Am­
erican note will contend that the
present expedition is necessarily out­
side any such proposal as that sug­
gested by General Carranza, since it
had for its purpose the crushing of
an organized and numerous force of
bandits, not the pursuit and punish­
ment of a marauding band of cattle
thieves.
It is possible also that the Ameri­
can reply will lay stress on the fact
that General Carranza himself has
ascribed to Villa no other purpose in
his border operation than to precipi­
tate a clash between the United
States and the de facto government.

PRESIDENT WILSON READY
TO WITHDRAW TROOPS
FROM MEXICAN SOIL

No Official Reports Have Been
Received of the Parral
Fracas.
Washington, April 1f.—President
Wilson has decided to inform Gen­
eral Carranza in response to his re
rpiest for withdrawal of the American
troops from Mexico that the United
States will negotiate for an agree­
ment along these liner.:
"The United States government is
willing to agree to fix a limit on the
distance the American troops now in
pursuit of Villa shall proceed into
Mexico, and to make that limit not
much farther south than the troops
already have proceeded."
Within Reasonable Time.
The Utiited States government is
•willing to give assurances that the
American troops will be withdrawn
"within a reasonable time," or as
soon as it is definitely established
that Villa has reached'a point where
he can be dealt with better by the
Carranza forces.
SEAMEN READY
TO SME
Owners Forced to Grant Salary
Increases by the
Union,
TEMPORARY SCHEDULE
WAS FORMULATED
Now York, April 1.").—Action which
was believed to be the forerunner oL'
an effort to cause a general strike
among seamen of all classes on ocean
going steamships resulted hero today
in one vessel, the American liner,
Mongolia, being delayed several
hours in sailing, and another, the
New York and Porto Rico liner, Braz­
os, being forced to anchor down the
bay after leaving her pier.
•When the vessels finally sailed, ot
was explained that a "truce had been
offered," and that some of the de­
mands of the strikers had been grant­
ed.
The demands of t'ne seamen were
printed in four languages: English,
Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, and
posted by the strikers on the
u\ion-
golia and .Brazos. They were signed
by the Atlantic division ot' the Inter­
national Seamen's Union of America,
an organization at the bead of which
is said to be Andrew Furescth, who
collaborated with United States Sen­
ator LaFollette of (Wisconsin in draft­
ing the new seaman's act.
In addition to a 2i per cent in­
crease in wages, to be known as "a
war risk bonus," applicable to all
classes of seamen aboard vessels
passing thron'gn limtipeiiii' war'sfonfte,
demands of further increases in
monthly pay were made.
Boy Riding' Bicycle Co/Hdcd With
Child and Injured the Little
Girl.
Mandan, N. D., April 1.".—'Lewista,
2-year-old daughter of Judge ,1. M.
Hanley, was seriously injured late
Friday afternoon, when a boy speed­
ing on the sidewalk near the lHanley
home with his bicycle crashed into
the little girl.
The boy was thrown from his bi­
cycle and both boy and bike landed
on top of the child. She was carried
into the house and a physician call­
ed. No hones were broken, but the
girl was badly -bruised and a small
cut was indicted above the ear. She
was taken violently ill after the ac­
cident. This morning, however, siie
had apparently recovered.
The police department, of the city
as a result of the accident, this
morning issued an edict that, bicy
cyles must be kept off the sidewalks.
"There have been numerous com­
plaints of near accidents," said Po­
lice Commissioner M". S. Lang this
morning, "and many riders have been
warned personally. However, this
seems to have done but little good
and from now on the city ordinance
will be strictly enforced.
"The police officers have been in­
structed to arrest any bicycle riders
caught on the sidewalks.
"This law enforcement is also to
be extended to the automobile driv­
ers. In the past the city officials have
been comparatively lenient with the
motor car owners, but with the in­
creased number of cars, the increased
business and traffic occasioned by the
growth of the city and country, we
msut enforce the laws," Mr. Lang
continued: "Speeding on the streets
of the city must be stopped, all auto­
mobiles must bear the state license
number, and the use of the blinding
headlights must also be done away
with in the city. There is hardly a
car which is not equipped with both
glare headlights and dimmers, and to
avoid accidents dimmers must be
used in the city.

TWO AMERICANS
ARL KILLED
Soldiers Had Gone to Parral to
Purchase Badly Needed
Supplies.
ATTACK ON TROOPS
WAS UNPROVOKED
Washington Relieved as Details
of Fracas Become Avail­
able.
Washington, April 15.—'The first, of­
ficial reports on the clash Wednesday
at Parral reaching the war depart­
ment late tonight from General Funs
ton said two American troopers and
40 Mexicans were killed.
Secretary Baker made this an­
nouncement
"Telegrams from General Funston
quoted a telegram from General Per­
shing to the effect that he had just
received information of an unprovok­
ed attack on American soldiers, who
had entered Parral to buy supplies.
His information is that two American
soldiers and 40 Mexicans were killed,,
but no further details had been re­
ported at the time.
"General Pershing also reports
that he had given full information to
General Huerrero as to the position,
direction and general destination of
our troops pursuing Villa. He has
sent by aeroplane for full particu­
lars."
General Pershing's message, giving
virtually the same information re­
garding the fish! as previously had
come from unofficial circles was re­
garded at the war department as dis­
posing of sensational rumors magni­
fying the incident, the reference to
General 'Huerrero, commander at Chi­
huahua was accepted as further dem­
onstrating the extent to which the
American and the de facto forces
were co-operating. Although the
message did not say so specifically,
officials took it for granted that the
attack on the Americans was made by
civilians, since any- hostile move by
Carrafiza troops would have called
for a definite statement from General
Pershing to that effect.
ASHES OF R. H. DAVIS
BURIED BESIDE PARENTS
Philadelphia, April 13.—'The ashes
of Hirliani Harding Davis, who died
at his home in Mont* Kiscn, N. Y., last.

graves of liis parents. The services
were conducted by an Episcopalian
clergyman, Charles Davis, a brother
of the author, and his wife, and Dr.
William H. Funiess, of New York, ac­
companied the body to the grave. The
body of Mr. Davis was cremated yes­
terday.
BE
Mexico City, April 15.—A statement
is published here and is given credit
by the Mexican people that the United
States has announced its intention of
withdrawing the troops now pursuing
Villa. High officials of the govern­
ment today expressed great pleasure
at this, but neither General Carranza
nor any members of his cabinet would
discuss the matter officially. They de­
sired to await official advices, they
Ray, from the Mexican ambasador at
Washington, Eliaso Arredondo.

Would Punish
Nations Who
Break Laws
Philadelphia, April lf.—The punish­
ment. of international law breaking
nations by making tlieni outlaws and
breaking off trade relations with them
was suggested here today by Dr. Dav­
id Jayne Hill, former ambassador to
Germany, and a member of the Per­
manent Administration Council to the
Hague Tribunal.
Dr. Hill was one or'the two former
ambassadors to Germany who spoke
before the American Philosophical so­
ciety on international law. The other
was Charlemagne Tower of this city.
Mr. Tower said conviction of war's
utility and renewed confidence in the
precept, of international law were the
chief intellectual gains to be hoped
for as the result of the war.

REELS, JIGS AND
FIREMEN'S DANCES
Most Enjoyable Affair That Has
Been Staged Since Pioneer
Days.
The most thoroughly enjoyed of all
the many good times which the Com­
mercial club rooms have played the
stage for this season was the reunion
of Mismarck and Uurleigh county set­
tlers of the seventies and eighties,
which came to a most' successful close
at midnight, this morning.
Between three and four hundred
people responded to the call sent out
by the executive committee to the
sons and daughters of the seventies.
The attendance, while no larger than
that at the successful function held
under the same auspices last fall, was
more representative, in that there was
a much larger delegation from the
country.
Old Folks' Night.
It was "old folks'" night, and the
people of the seventies and eighties
and their sons and daughters joined
with glad abandon in firemen's danc­
es, Dan Tuckers, Turkeys in the
Stray, reels, jigs, quadrilles and dan­
cers of the good old days, which,
strangely enough were found just a
trifle more enjoyable than any of the
new steps of the present. Fred Car
sten's stentorian voice never appeared
to better advantage than in calling
the various figures, arid his
Permanent Pioneer Organization.
The organization of a permanent
Pioneer Association of Burleigh Coun­
ty, Dakota Territory, with 200 charier
members, was the first order of the
evening. The constitution and set of
by-laws presented by the committee
named at last November's meeting
were adopted unanimously, and there
was named for tlu first year, without
a dissenting voice, the following offi­
cers:
President —General 10. A. Williams.
First vice president--Mrs. l{. I!.
Marsh.
'Second vice president Mrs. Austin
Logan.
Third vice president—Mrs. .1. P.

Secretary Mrs. Mary McLean.
Assistant secretary .1. i. McDon­
ald
Treasurer—Austin Logan.
Historian-—M.rs. M. Jewell.
Closed With Song.
The formal exercises closed with
Ihe singing of Ihe following verses,
composed by one of Hismarek's first
white women, set to the tune of
'"Marching Through Georgia":
Here's to the 70's.
Here's to the good Old Timers, now
they've come to join the band,
Tried uul true for forty years lo this
their chosen land.
We are glad to get. together, and we'll

Two More Provisions to Federal­

Out.
SENATOR BORAH

very graceful and well-executed jig of

IN BITTER ATTACK
Washington, April in.—Two more
provisions designed to strengthen the
federal status of the National Guard
were written into the senate army bill
today. In the course of a debate, en­
livened by charges 'hat. federal funds
provided Ihe National Guard in past
years had been foolishly thrown away,
and in some cases embezzled, the sen­
ate adopted amendments providing
that all officers of the Guard above
the rank of captain, be paid $500 a
year by the federal government, and
that all guardsmen on enlistment be
required to take an oath to obey or­
ders from the president as well as the
governor of their respective states.
The attack on guard officers for
their use of federal funds was made
by Senator Borah in a speech oppos­
ing the Reed amendment for federal
pay. The Idaho senator declared the
$S,000,000 available annually for use
of the Guard under Dick Militia law
had been "shamefully" utilized by offi­
cers to the exclusion of enlisted men,
and that, some of it "had been embez­
zled." Senators Reed, Pomeran and
others defended the Guardsmen and
the federal pay amendment was adopt­
ed 41 to 14.
To support his charge, Senator Bor­
ah cited the annual report of the war
department on the expediture of the
militia. ftuucL-v"' -4
Senator Ree8 introduced an amend­
ment late today to provide schools to
train young men as reserve officers
for the army and navy.

Washing)on, April 15.—While 'Pres­
ident Wilson and Secretary Lansing
today were engaged in marshalling the
accumulation of evidence that Ctor
many, in her submarine warfare, had
violated solemn pledges given to the
United States, official word of two
more shipping disasters, apparently
due to illegal acts by Gertnan submar­
ine commanders, was received at the
state department, Consular dispatch­
es indicated that the steamship. Mar
gam Abbey, was attacked without
warning on April S, and that the Ab­
erdeen was sunk by shell Are after
the crew had been forced to the small
boats, more than 100 miles from shore.
Americans were aboard both ships
and were endangered.
Cases Investigated.
These two cases are being: Investi­
gated and may be included in the
American indictment of German meth­
ods of conducting submarine warfare,
which it was understood tonight prob­
ably would be ready for transmission
to Berlin early next week.
The president and Secreary iAn
sing devoted a large part of the day
to the consideration of the submarine
situation.
It became known here tonight that
the contemplated action of the United
Statep, which is expected to bring
the submarine controversy to a clear
cut issue, is being watched closely by
the diplomatic representatives of oth­
er neutral nations. The IJnited States
is taking into consideration the cases
of many neutral vessels, which, while
not carrying American cft&renB, have
been sunk by German submarines. An
investigation of these cases hats beeit
proceeding on the ground that' it was
only by chance American citizens
were aboard the ship when disaster
overcame them.
Furthermore, the interests of the
United States and other neutrals are
understood lo be identical in some of
the cases.
