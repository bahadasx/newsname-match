fcNo Chanee In Original Orders.''
By United l'ress.
WASHINGTON, April 15. That the
Villa hunt will continue for the pres
ent was made doubly certain by Sec
retary of War tonight
In a formal statement he declared
that no change in the original orders
to break up Villa's band had been
made, and that none is in contempla
tion. He left a loophole, however,
whereby in a week or in a month the
American forces can be withdrawn.
He said informally that there is no
"present" Intention of changing or
ders and left the impression that the
administration policy toward Mexico
is not fully developed.
Carranza's continued co-operation
with the Villa punitive expedition is
believed to play an important part in
the administration's plans, making the
status of the expedition into Mexico
as it was at the beginning In cordial
co-operation with the de facto gov
ernment. R. G. HARRIS, CENTRALIA, PIES

JOHN E. SWANGER IS CONFIDENT
Sedalia Editor Believes Hell Win
Nomination for Governor.
"I am confident that I will be nomi
nated Republican candidate for gov
ernor," John E. Swanger of Sedalia
said yesterday morning to a Mis-
sourian reporter. He had come to Co
lumbia the day before to be a judge
at the Missouri-Colorado debate.
"The assurances my friends have
given me make me feel that way," he
added. "Twenty-one counties of the
state voluntarily indorsed my candid
acy" Mr. Swanger announced himself In
favor of better and surer support for
the educational institutions of the
state. "My position on the subject
of education is In every way for ad
vancement in the rural districts, in
the towns and cities, and the higher
institutions of learning," he said. "I
am a friend of the University and es
pecially of the School of Journalism."
Mr. Swanger is editor and publisher
of the Sedalia Capital, and employs as
city editor a graduate of the School

"I believe in promoting agricul
tural interests," he continued, "and
in endeavoring to bring capital and
labor to Missouri. We want people
who can aid in developing the nat
ural resources. We need factories,
too."
Mr. Swanger was secretary of state
of Missouri from 1904 to 1908.

COLUMBIA, MISSOURI,
M.U. WINS AND LOSES
OVER PREPAREDNESS
Colorado Debate Here a Vic
tory Texas Takes Argu
ment at Austin.
BOTH BY A 2-1 VOTE
Mexican Situation Is Cited
by Speakers for and
Against Armament.
Missouri defeated Colorado and lost
to Texas, by a two-to-one decision in
each case, in the two debates held
Friday night on the question, "Re
solved, that the armament of the Unit
ed States should be materially in
creased over that obtaining and pro
vided for on August 1, 1913." The de
bate with Colorado was held here in
the University Auditorium; the
one with Texas was at Austin.
Morris E. Dry, of Mexico, Mo., a
sophomore in the College of Arts and
Science, and Bernard T. Hurwltz of
Kansas City, a junior in the same col
lege, upholding the affirmative, won
the decision here over Ralph W. Pel
ta and Walter E. Fisher of the Uni
versity of Colorado.
A. F. McClanahan of Liberal, a
junior in the College of Arts and Sci
ence, and P. C. Sprinkle of Belton, a
student in the School of Law, lost
when they argued the negative against
the University of Texas team at Aus
tin. Judges From Out of Town.
The judges in the debate here were
Ovid Bell of the Fulton Gazette. John
E. Swanger of the Sedalia Capital and
Prof. Charles Flow of Central College,
Fayette. Dr. J. W. Hudson of the de
partment of philosophy acted as chair
man. Mr. Dry, leading for the affirmative,
claimed that war is entirely possible
because: "The sources of war are
unpredictable; from any one of our
conflicting foreign policies offensive
interpretations may arise; the conser
vation of the humanitarian principles
of international law indisputably de
mands that a number of duties, as well
as of rights, be enforced by armed
force, and a neutral nation unwilling
or unable to maintain these duties
will naturally find itself shorn of its
rights."
The speaker futher showed the im
possibility of our armies effectively
and expeditiously to terminate the
situation with Mexico, the very weak
est enemy with whom we might go to
war.
Holds That AH Is Well Now .
The negative based its debate upon
the argument that even if war should
come the armament of this country is
wholly adequate; that war against the
United States is improbable, and that
a greater armament is an unsound
I,olic' for tllis public to follow, in-
""' us euummuuaiiy aim national
ly and leading to the very thing we
wish to avoid militarism and war
Mr. Pelta, speaking first for the ne
gative, said: "A de facto government
has been recognized and U being
ip.'iiiitained in Mexico. Wo pray that
the plea for over-preparedness be
changed into a realization that the
peace of the United State is to be
assured, not by huge armaments.
wasteful armies and costly navies, but
by the respect and confidence of the
world.'"
Sees Ihtnper of War With Japan.
Mr. Hurwitz, the second speaker
for Missouri, pointed out the danger
of a war with Japan. "Our margin of
superiority over Japan, the weakest
first class power, is not sufficient to
insure against the accidents of war,"
he held. "Japan is a leading nation;
she has her own navy yards; she
has the resources of China; above all,
she has the aggressive spirit of na
tionalism" He also directed atten
tion to the weakness of our nav?.
The second Colorado speaker Mr
Fisher, described the strength cf our
defense,-. "Our army." he said, "is
showing its strength and efficiency in
Mexico. In the light of the fact that
to navy can operate far from its base
'rf siinnlips. nnr navr is cnmnar:iive-
r ' "
Skater tnan excePl that of
rw coast defenses can
v -w . .
outrange any attacking fleet."
Each speaker had five minutes for
rebuttal. Mr. Hurtwiz, in the last
speech of the debate, summed tin the
pffilrmative's plea for preparedness In
the statement, "Ultimate peace will
come when the greatest miltary pow
er Is in the hands of the most paciPc
nations."

Columbia's new hotel, the Daniel

cost considerably more than $100.
000. The hotel will be five stories
high and fireproof, with two wings
and a lobby between them. The lobby
will be one story high.
These statements repressnt a new
plan announced yesterday by E. W.
Stephens, chairman of the new hotel
committee.
The size of the hotel, as planned
originally, was 73 by 90 feet. It has
now been decided that it will occupy
the whole block from Seventh to Gui
tar streets and will be 113 by 90 feet.
Two store rooms will occupy the ad
ditional ground on the first floor, next
to Guitar street.
The hotel will have 100 rooms and
on the fourth nd fifth floors, in
the northeast end of the building,
will be a large banquet hall and ball
room. The dining room will be on the
north and west sides, where there will
be a private entrance for women. In
the northwest corner, on the first
floor, will be a writing room. The
elevator will be on the north side of
the lobby.
'As soon as the $20,000 bonus is in
the bank, L. W. Dumas, Jr., will put
up a $30,000 bond and then the bonus
will be given him," said Mr. Stephens

By next Christmas Day we ought to
be ready for a good old Boone County
grand opening. Everything now de
pends on the quick response of those
who have not paid their subscrip
tions." Mr. Stephens said that competent
Iegal advice had been obtained to see
that there were no loopholes in the
contracts. I
The nanus of all the contributors
to the bonus fund will be written on
parchment and placed in a glass
frame in the lobby of the hotel. A
roll of parchment with the names of
the contributors will also be placed
in the corner-stone.

River near Huntsdale. The body
was brought to Columbia, .where
it has since been held by the Parker

According to a verdict by a coro
ner's jury, following an inquest held
by Coroner EC G. Davis, Steele's death
resulted from injuries received in a
fall at Jefferson City March 17. Steele
was night watchman o nthe boat. He
complained several times to his fel

by the fall. He was about o. years

L
HIT BY INJUNCTIONS
Orders Against Express and
Railroad Companies Grant
ed by Judge Harris.
GOOD UNTIL FRIDAV
Application to Make Them
Permanent Will Be
Heard Then.
Temporary restraining orders
against the Wabash, M. K. &. T. and
Chicago & Alton railroads and the
American and Wells-Fargo Express
Companies were granted yesterday by
Judge David II. Harris of the Circuit
Court.
The orders prohibit the railroads
and express companies from receiv
ing, transporting, delhering or stor
ing intoxicating liquor in Columbia
and Boone County until next Friday,
when a hearing on the application for
a permanent injunction will take
place.
The petitions for the injunctions
against the railroads were filed yes
terday in the circuit clerk's office by
Prosecuting Attorney W. M. Dinwid
die. Those against the express com
panies were filed Thursday by Mr.
Dinwiddle and .Mayor James M.
Batterton, representing the city. The
petitions asked for temporary injunc
tions until a hearing to make them
permanent could be held.
The restraining orders were served
by the sheriff's office late yesterday
afternoon. The orders, therefore, did
not affect shipments of liquor that
were received in the morning.
"This is a great victory for the dry
forces of Boone County," said Mrs.
John T. Esrey, president of the local
branch of the W. C. T. U. "The W. C.
T. U. and the people of Boone Coun
ty should rejoice over the granting
of the restraining orders. We are now
hoping that the court will make them
permanent."
It is not expected that the rail
roads will oppose the injunctions, ac
cording to railroad officials. C. E.
McGee, agent for the express com
panies, said that he did not know
whether the companies would oppose
the order.
ALL READY FOR CLEAN-UP WEEK
Wagons Will Begin Collecting' Tra.h
Early Tomorrow Morning-.
The Clean-Up Week campaign will
begin tomorrow, and will continue un
til the work is done. Citizens are re
quested to have all refuse at the front
of the house preferably on the park
ing, as the teams will not go into
alleys to collect it. The Columbia
Special Road District has lent four
teams, and several business firms
have also contributed teams. Major J.
M. Batterton gives the list as: Davis
& Watson. Whittle & Hockaday, H. R.
Jackson, Dalton Coal Company, Bowl
ing Lumber Company, Boone County
Lumber Company, Taylor-Estes Lum
ber Company and Hetzler Brothers.
It is the feeling of the City Coun
cil that since the city is doing so
much toward the campaign, every
citizen should do his best to have the
refuse from his premises at the proper
place at the proper time.
