JEFFERSON HIGHWAY
Annual Directors Meeting at Mus
kogee, Okla., Selects Two Offi
cers from Decatur County.
The first annual meeting of the
directors of the Jefferson Highway
•was held at Muskogee, Oklahoma, on
Tuesday and Wednesday of last
week and it was largely attended by
the enthusiasts who are going to
make the Jefferson Highway the
greatest auto highway in the United
States.
Decatur county, represented by di
rector W. A. Hopkins of Lamoni, and
Jas. F. Harvey, of Leon, was very
much on the map at the meeting, and
at the annual election of officers De
catur county was signally honored,
Mr, Hopkins being elected as vice
president of the International Asso
ciation and his position as director
was filled by the remaining member
of the Iowa directors by selecting
Jas. F. Harvey of Leon, as Iowa di
rector. This gives Decatur county,
two members of the permanent or
ganization, which is now fully or
ganized all the way from New Or
leans, La., to Winnipeg, Canada.
The meeting at Muskogee was an
enthusiastic one, and the Muskogee
Times-Democrat in a big write-up of
the meeting, commenced its article
as follows:
"Fur beclad good roads boosters
from the pines of Minnesota today
mingled with daintily gowned lady
enthusiasts from the palms of Louis
iana, while broad brimmed sombrer
oed gentlemen from tbe plains of
Texas cussed bad roads and discuss
ed good ones with the clean-cut,
bright-eyed, alert, better roads ad
vocates from Iowa, Missouri and Ok
lahoma who gathered in Muskogee
today to attend the first anuual di
rectors* meeting of the International
Jefferson Highway Association,
whose business is to construct an
automobile roadway from Winnipeg,
Canada, to New Orleans."
Des Moines and other papers re
cently had an article stating that the
Jefferson Highway had been perma
nently located through Allerton and
Chariton, whicn would eliminate
Leon from the Highway, but this so
called JefTerson Highway, is not the
real thing, but is composed of a
bunch down in Missouri and up
through Iowa who are trying to
make it appear they are the real
Jefferson Highway and have gone
ahead and organized a trail under
this same name, without authority
from the real Jefferson Highway. The
route of the Jefferson Highway has
been permanently located through
Leon and will remain here, and the
efforts of these other parties in try
ing to steal the name and recogni
tion -will not avail them anything.
The active affairs of the Jefferson
Highway are in the hands of Mr. J.
Clarkson as general manager and
the numerous boosters aiong nearly
two thousand miles of the route. The
'organization is completed and in ev
r" fy state there has been a great
amount of work done on the road
during the last vear with a promise
of a great deal more to be done in
the year to come.
Doing Lots of Road Work in Wood
land Township.
The good roads boosters of Wood
land township are doing a big lot of
splendid work on their roads. There
is a contest up over the selection of
the route for the new trail from
Llneville to Des Moines up through
Woodland and High Point townships,
and the nrst of this week gangs of
men and teams were at work on
both routes putting them in the best
of condition, and the work was all
being donated. One piece of donated
work is estimated to cost 11,000, but
the Woodland township farmers are
going to show all the lalanee of the
county something on making good
roads. When you want to take a
Sown
leasure ride.' just drive your auto
through Woodland township
and see what they are doing.
Will Rebuild Garden Grove Oi»ei-a
House.
Mrs Dilsaver, who has been in the
southwest the past few months, came
home last week to look after her In
terests here. We are told she ex
pects to rebuild the opera house at
once. The plan under consideration
will be somewhat different from the
building that was burned. The front
will be changed, having a recess
with doors on each side of the ticket
booth. It will be 20 feet ..longer
than the old buildine and will have
no gallery. It is certainly hoped that
it will be rebuilt as it will be a line
thing for the town.—Garden Grove
Express.

THE
I. O. O. F. Roll Call.
There was a big time at the an
nual roll call and election of officers
of the Odd Fellows lodge last Friday
night. Grand Master W. S. Kight, of
Des Moines, was present and made a
splendid talk of more than an hour,
which was a rare treat to the mem
bers, for he is one of the best talk
ers ever heard in this city. There
was work in the first degree, the
candidate being Ralph Ridgeway.

Enjoyed Musical Kecitul.
The M. E. churtfi was filled last
Wednesday evening at a private re
cital given with the compliments of
Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Alexander of
this city. It was expected when the
invitations were issued that Miss
Elizabeth Spencer soprano, and Mr.

illness of Miss Spencer, Mr. Reed
Miller, one of the highest paid tenor
soloists in the leading churches of

human voice and the re-creation,
and the same was true of the violin
playing by Mr. Polk. It was a rare
treat which was greatly enjoyed by
all nresent. and many compliments
were given Mr. and Mrs. Alexander
for providing such a splendid even
ing of music.
Another Husker Claims Honors.
Claiming that he is the champion
corn husker of Iowa, Oscar Olsen,
who lives on a farm ten miles north
west of Mason City, authorizes a
challenge to all claimants to the title
—the contest to be for a purse of
a sufficient size to make it an object.
This challenge is especially directed
to Cedar Rapids which appears to be
backing one James Wall of near
Iowa City. Olsen made a record in
1914 during the months of October
and November when he husked 3,
b36 bushels in twenty-eight days.
During the week just passed Mr. Ol
sen husked 946 bushels, being 157
z-'d uushels per day, six days, nine
hours and one half a day. On elec
tion day Mr. Olsen expected to set a
new world's record, but was pre
vented by rain. During the four and
a half hours "he" worked "he husked
ninety-three bushels.
Olarcnce Swanson Accidentally Shot.
Last Saturday morning Clarence
Swanson and Glenn Hutchinson, boys
14 and lx years of age, were out
hunting on the Gurley George farm
just east of Leon. When they were
ready to start home Glen Hutchinson
was in the act of loading his .22
calibre rifle when in some manner it
was acidentally discharged, the ball
striking Clarence Swanson, who was
standing five or six feet away, in the
calf of the right leg, inflicting a
painful but not serious wound. The
injured lad was brought to town and
an X-ray examination showed that
the ball was lodged against the
large bone in his leg and the attend
ing physician decided to allow it to
remain, as the bone was npt injured.
Clarence has suffered considerable
pain from the wound, but is getting
along nicely and will soon be out
again.
He'll Stop After This.
Clerk-elect Ralph Rumley will
sure stop and wait after this -when a
car comes up behind him and the
driver toots his horn. One night
last week Ralph and Charles Horn
vveVe driving the former's car home
from Des Moines, and up near. Indi
anola they noticed a car coming up
on them. Ralph is a fair driver and
not many cars pass him on the road
so he gently stepped on the button
and away they went. This continu
ed for about ten miles, and finally
a big mud hole stopped them and
the second car caught up with them.
Imagine their feelings when the two
young men in the Becond car inform
ed them they had lost their spare
casing and rim about ten miles back,
and they saw-it fall off, so stopped
and nicked it up and had been chas
ing them for ten miles to restore it
to them.

a big car coming from the south
with brilliant lights blinded him and
he ran up on the span of little bur
rows hitched to a light wagon, own

turned his car sharply to the left
side of the road and then whipped it
back when the left rear wheel smash

at the same time and quick as a
flash the car turned turtle. The top
was down, so there was no protec

Mrs. Coder were thrown out of the
car, but Mr. Bradfield, wife and lit
tle daughter were caught under the
car, but fortunately were not injur
ed aside from a few minor bruises
and scratches. Harry was held un
der the car until several parties who
were near rushed to his assistance.
Mrs. Coder's arm and knee were se
verely bruised when she struck the
ground. The little old Ford nevec.
stopped running, the engine chug
ging away until it was shut off after
the occupants were released from
under the car. The car was not
damaged much aside from the steer

windshield smashed, and everybody
is happy over the fortunate termina
tion of what might have been a very
serious accident.

The high school foot ball game at
Lamoni on Thanksgiving day result
ed in a victory for Leon. The game
was a much better one than the
score would indicate. Our boys had
to work hard for each inch of
ground gained.
Leon kicked off to Lamoni and
for ten minutes was outplayed. La
moni executed long forward passes
and punched the line for big gains.
At the end of the first quarter Leon
had worked the ball to the one yard
line, and on the first play of the sec
ond quarter Scott carried it over for
a touch down. In the third quarter
Gardner carried the ball over, and
in the fourth quarter Tom Grogan
made the final touch down for the
season. Grimes kicked goal success
fully after each touch down of the
game. Leon played a hard consist
ent game, not once did a man fail
in his duty. In the fourth quarter
Lamoni was within a yard of the
goal line with four downs to make
the distance. In tlie four trials not
an inch was gained and Leon kicked
out of danger.
Lamoni played a splendid game.
man on their team faltered once,

On Monday another fanciful Para
mount romance of the Orient comes,
presenting Marie Doro in "The White
Pearl. Marie Doro, the enchant
ing young star who through her first
appearance in motion pictures in
that great film creation, "The Morals
of Marcus," endowed the screen with
a new personality, again attains a
desisive triumph in tne Famous Play
ers Film Co.'s elaborate five-part
photo-production, "The White
Pearl,' by Edith Barnard Delano,
author of "Rags." "The White
Pearl is a fanciful romance of the
orient, with which drama and mys
tery are absorbingly interwoven. In
this unusual story, the strong at
tachment between two young Amer
ican lovers survives and triumphs
over the machinations of a band of
Jananese geisha traders, the influ
ence of a 'Hindu legend of death
which for a time threatens the life of
the girl and the caprices of destiny
itself. Throughout the entire pro
duction Miss Doro proves herself
thoroughly captivating and dramati
cally effective.

and Marie Doro in "The
White Pearl" Monday.
Every night is a feature night now
at the popular Idle Hour theatre, but
on Friday of this week there is an
®xtra Paramount feature play, when
uie Charles Frohman Co., presents
Pauline Frederick in a super-photo

century, "Zaza." The Famous Play
ers Film Co.'s magnificent picturiza
tion of the immortal drama, "Za
za," with Pauline Frederick, the su
preme emotional artist, in the cele
brated title role, is one of the great
est dramatic achievements yet con
tributed to the screen. The marvef
lous sympathy and mastery with
which Miss Frederick has interpret
ed the emotions and the complex
character of the Paris music hall
singer is a lasting monument to her
amazing histrionic powers. "Zaza" ia
one of the few greatest stage roles
ever created, and Miss Frederick's
rendition of the exacting characteri
zation, together with the sumptuous
