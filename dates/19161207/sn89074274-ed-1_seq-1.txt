Equity Convention Is
Breaking All Records
St. Paul, Dec. 5.—High powered au
tomobiles and luxurious Pullman cars
brought northwest farmers by the
thousands to St. Paul today, to attend
the second annual convention of th«
National Equity Grain and Livestock
Growers association.
Five thousand attendance at the
convention, which lasts from today
until Thursday, is anticipated*^ Al
though the majority of these came
from North Dakota, Minnesota and
South Dakota, every state in the west
and middle west was represented by
the terrific influx that started today.
Some registrations from the Pacific
coast states were made today.
One of the leading events of the con
vention is the dedication of a $500,000
grain elevator on the upper levee of
the Mississippi river tomorrow. This
elevator marks the culmination of
North Dakota's bitter fight, which
merged into a political battle at which
farmers won. Ugly charges against
the Minneapolis chamber of com
merce were hurled during the fight.
This elevator is designed to compete
with the Minneapolis concern.
Two resolutions were placed before
the convention immediately upon its
being called to order by President J.
M. Anderson at 10 a. m. today, at St.
Paul's municipal auditorium. The res
olutions called for an interstate com
merce commission investigation of al
leged excessive demurrage charges, to
be effective next spring, and of the
present.car shortage.
A member of President Wilson's
cabinet is expected to attend the dedi
cation of the Equity elevator tomor
row. Robert Bridges, president of the
Seattle port commission, and C. J.
Brandt, chief of the department of
agriculture, will conduct the dedica
tion service.
