Th» Farmer'» Wife.
In the Woman's Home Companion Is
an article by a farmer's wife, who
says:
"Given a good husband and good
health, there's no one In the world
who needs pity less than the farmer's
wife. She hns a rich and resourceful
life if she will make It so, and she
usually does. She's the most Inde
pendent woman on earth of panics and
money stringencies and things of that
sort. Her family simply can't go
hungry. There'll always be potatoes
and turnips down In the cellar and
meat In the smokehouse, to say the
least. She always has eggs and
chickens and milk. She can take a
bushel of wheat to the mill and get it
ground for 10 cents. She can draw
on her storeroom for fruit and sweets,
and her table Is supplied. When the
mechanic Is out of work his family
must stop eating or live on charity,
but it Isn't so in the farmer's family.
Capital and labor have got to do some
mighty hard grinding before they
grind the farmer."

Peering wildly round, the man
thought he saw his hat In a yard be

over, he started to chase it, but each
time lie thought he had caught it, it
got yet another move on.
Then a woman's angry voice broke
on his ears.
"What are you doing there?" she de
manded shrilly.
He explained mildly that he was

Channlng slunk into the city of
Shanghai like a criminal. He had
come down the Yangtze river on out*
of the big rolling passenger steamers,
and he had hardly closed his wearied
eyes during that period.
A great fear and dread pursued him
like a grim enemy. Every blapd Asi
atic face on the steamer from the cab
in boy to a wealthy mandarin travel
ing with his suit bore a hidden menace
to the American.
Now that he had disembarked from
the landing tug at Shanghai Channlng
breathed a little easier. If any one
was trailing him—if an assassin lurked
behind him—the task would be more
difficult in the brightly lighted city
and in the crowded hotel.
Once in his locked room at the hoteL
be drew a deep sigh of relief and flung
his bag aside.
"My God!" he muttered. "Will it he
tike this—always?"
lie stared at his haggard face In
the mirror and laughed mirthlessly.
Who would recognize Henry Chan
nlng, the well known clubman—rich,
successful, and especially noted for his
collection of oriental carvings? Chan
nlng shuddered and sank wonkly into
a chair.
The weakness for collecting had be
come a madness—a madness that
might end in his death. Yet who
would know—who would guess?
"Dumb gods cannot speak." he mut
tered harshly.
Later be went down to dinner, and
he bore himself a3 of old, erect, smil
ing, with a hearty greeting for one or
two old friends who had met in tills
far corner of the world.
They dined together and Cbannirig
announced his intention of going on
the first steamer.
"Then you will sail tomorrow," they
told him. "The Korea is due at 9
o'clock." , .
Channlng excused himself and has
tened out to telephone for a reserva
tion. rfe was fortunate in finding the
office open, and when he returned to
the dining room he felt lighter hearted
than lie had for days—before he had
made that ill omened visit to the rock
temple.
"Wliat's the matter, Channlng? Are
you seeing ghosts?" one of his com
panions laughed.
He shook himself out of the brief
abstraction that had set him to star
ing vaguely into space.
"Something like that," he muttered
apologetically. Then he resumed his
old charming manner and the incident
wa3 forgotten for the time. After
ward they recalled it and wondered.
The next morning he sailed for home
-and the voyage wns a hideous repe
tition of that trip down the Yangtze
river—when every strange face was an
enemy face to his distorted vision. He
thanked heaven that he coaid mingle
with white men once more and lie re
solved that this should ho Ills last trip
to the orient. But ho wns destined to
make another one.
lie was restless again when they
reached San Francisco. The long jour
ney across the continent was a bore,
and when lie reached New York, ami.1
old surroundings, lie felt a childish in
clination to cry.
Days passed and he lost the sense of
fear. Who knew his secret besides
himself?
"Dumb gods cannot speak." he ar
gued stubbornly.
For some time after arrival in New
York dimming did not take up his

old time ways, but remained In serin
s!ou. To the few friends whom he
met lie seemed low spirited and cast
down, ms though something weighed
heavily on his mind.
Soon he left the city for a sojourn
in a country hamlet on Long island,
s nd here he remained until he seemed
io have regained a semblance of his
own self. Finally he returned to the
city and began life ngnin where be
had mit off when he made his trip t»>

session of which seemed to be tin

Four men gathered in the club lounge
looked up and nodded greeting when
Dacre joined them. Lighting a ciga
rette, lie glanced qulszdcally around the
group.
"What's the matter?" ho asked,
"deadlock!" grunted Ötevens.
"It's Channlng again," complained
Wray. "He declares that the charm
and mysticism of the fjir east are all
tommy rot Says he'^ traveled the
whole oriental circuit and never en
countered a superstition, that wasn't a
bubble of hot air. Now, Dacre, you
know we Uko to believe' that 'some
where east of Suez' lies all the glamour
of the 'Arabian Nights,** Hang it all, a
man's got to have some delusions left
him!"
"Keep away from the east, then."
sneered Channlng. *
"Why?" asked Dacre. '
Channlng stared at his cigar. "Too
maHy ruined temples, ferocious stone
gods and imaginary dAfgons snorting
fire and fury. A tancf glutted with
superstition."
Dr. Wnkeman exploded wrathful
Iy. "Most of my traveling has been
from one sickroom to another, but 1
like to believe there's a bit of poetry
and charm in the terrestrial anatomy
that I needn't cut outi'%
They laughed, looking at Dacre, who
had just returned from,-China.
"What is your opinion. Dacro?" asked
Stevens.
"I've lived In the east for years,"
said Dacre slowly. 'T've seen strong
men quake before the Wrath of their
gods—aye, I mean gods of wood and
stone—and I know of a tiny image of
Buddha which would speak to a cer
tain mau—if the man could be found "
"Hear! near!" applauded Wray.
Dacre smiled reminiscently.
"Near the Yangtze river there is a
small Buddhist temple dedicated to the
'god of averted calamity.' Its altars
are always covered with votive offer
lings, for many pilgrims come there
Chinese pirates, laden with rich booty,
bring costly trinkets to placate the god.
Honest sailors pause to leafe a bit of
coral or amber. Mandarins go ashore
to pledge jewels for a safe voyage, and
occasionally foreign tqfirists stumble
upon the temple and try*to buy curios."
Channlng sat rigidly in his chair, lie
listened acutely.
"Of course," resumed Dacre. "the
priests swear that the treasures are
not for sale—this is the story of a man
with n mania for collecting jr.de and
ivory carvings, who wouldn't believe
In the wrath of the gods. He enmo to
the temple and saw its riches. He
tried to buy some earrings, hut the
aged priest refused to selL
Smith—the man's name might have
been Smith—laughed and went away.
He told himself that every man had
his price and that if ho could only find
out the priest's price why he could
have his choice of the ivory carvings.
So he schemed and schemed and at
last the only plan that he could con
ceive was a very ordinary one.
Ile went direct to the priest and of
fered to buy the most precious carving
of all. The priest was obdurate.
" *Tho wrath of the gods will bo upon
me,' he declared.
'The richest man in the world
wants to buy,' wheedled Smith.
The priest hesitated and hta onyx
eyes glittered covetously.
The honorable foreigner Is the rich
man?' he asked tentatively.
Smith nodded.
•And the price?'
Smith named it Enough to buy a
little house and garden on the slopes
of the Yangtze, where the priest's
aged sisters could end their days in
peaceful plenty.
"It was a hitter temptation. The
priest was very poor and he hesitated.
At last he spoke. Ts not the honorable
foreigner afraid of the wrath of the
gods T
"Smith langhed again. Til take n
chance on that,' ho said carelessly,
'now about it? Is it a bargain?" And
he held out eager hands for the ivory
carving he most coveted.
"Still the, priest hesitated. *The
wrath of the gods is not to be lightly
spoken of.' ho reproved. 'When dumb
gods speak, then shall the heart of the
guilty quake.'
"But Smith was not to bo frightened
out of his desire for the ivory Buddha.
Ho could see in his mind's eye the
very niche in his cabinet wbére the
caning would stand—next to the Jade
amulet, the flower of his collection. He
gritted hi3 teeth and said he would
not be disappointed. Then he smiled
on the priest, dropped a liberal contri
bution in the bronze box at the door
and went away to brood over the ivory
carving.
"ne wns not afraid of the wrath of a
dumb ivory god. He laughed at the
very Idea. But what did the man mean
by saying dumb gods could speak?
That was all tommyrot. Smith didn't
believe in the occult. He was a plain,
matter of fact sort of chap. He col
lected ivories. He had found one that
he wanted, and because he could not
have It ho wanted it the more. A few
days later he went back to the temple.
The priest mot him gravely.
" 'About that ivory carving.' Smith
paid, and the priest nodded and
brought the sandalwood chest that
held his treasures.
"Smith gloated over them once more.
Crystal, amber, coral. Ivory, sandal
wood. c-bony— all held his attention and
excited his greed, but his fancy still
clung to the most precious of them all.

had drained away, showing him hol

"Well?" demanded Channlng harshly.
Dacre shrugged und resumed, "As I
was saying, the foreigner escaped, and
I suppose he has the haunting memory

"Dacre!" Chanuing's countenance
was tense and suffering.
They all stared as Dacre placed a
small ivory imago on fhc table.
With a long, shuddering sigh Chan

A light broke over Dncre's face.
"This," he explained, "is a replica of
the god of averted calamity. He
speaks of (he priest who risked his life
to protect the temple treasures. He
tells of the priest's gratitude to another
American who happened along to dress
his wounds, and he speaks in a voice
of thunder to the man who believes
himself a murderer, but whose hands
are clean!"
Channlng lifted hopeful eyes to meet
friendly glances.
"Dacre, how did you find out?" he
groaned.
"I—why I—didn't dream it until a

Suddenly his glance cleared. He push

Ways Some Plant3 Have.
A study of botany reveals that there
are expert "bomb droppers" as well ns
trained artillerists in the plant world.
In the "flying fruits" of the Califor
nia pine is presented a curious antici
pation of bomb dropping from aero
planes.
The ecballium or "squirting cucum
ber" Is one of the best known of plant
artillerists. When its seed pod ripens
this bends over, breaks away from
the stem and "fires" its juice and seeds
to a distance of from three to six feet.
The common garden balsam Is an
other plant having warlike methods.
It scatters its seeds by a veritable ex
plosion of its pod, which bursts much
like a shrapnel shell, and hurls its con
tents in ail directions.
In the fruits of many thistles n sim
ilar plan is to he observed. The Huffy
parachutes float about in the air for
a considerable time and may travel a
considerable distance. The moment
one of those strikes against an obsta
cle or is hung up in any position the
fruit at once is severed from its sup
porting parachute and natural!» falls
to the earth.
Study the Poets.
The great poets have not become
part of the race experience as they
should. Ignored, forgotten, save by
the chosen few, they do not, to our im
measurable loss, enter into the daily
life of common folk. We are so proud
of our wheels that go fast; of our un
paralleled housekeeping arrangements:
so unabashed, amid the splendors of
asphalt, electricity and aluminum, by
our intellectual and spiritual poverty.
Would it not be well for us to pause,
if pause is possible for us, to consider
our inner lack? Can we not spare
some minutes from our adoration of
our national materialistic god to teach
the young that it is good to be in the
company of those who interpret life in
terms of spirit, not in terms of ma
terial prosperity; In terms of spirit,
j no t of flesh; in terms of beauty, whose
; appeal may quicken the will to

The j apan ese Rite For the Battle
r
Slain of the World,
IT EMBRACED ALL NATIONS.
On a Floating Temple In Sumida River
a Priest of Tokyo, With His Flock, Of.
fered Prayers For the Souls of Sol
diers Dead Because of Wars.
Unusual preparations were made one
morning in Shussanji, or the Going
Out of the Mountain temple, a quaint
little place of worship hidden away in
a labyrinth of crooked streets In a poor
quarter of Tokyo—preparations for a
celebration on the Sumida river to
pray for the repose of the souls of all
those slain in battle regardless of na
tionality and to scatter scraps of paper
bearing the image of JIzo Sama over
the waves, one for each departed spirit
The chief priest, an aged man, with
his assistant and the supporters of the
temple, had been busy for days in ad
vance, nml all was ready. The red and
gold altar of Shussanjl was heaped up
with offerings of rice and fruit, und a
plain wooden tablet had been placed
there bearing the words:
"To console all those souls who have
passed into the beyond because of
war."
The old priest, his bald head shining,
clad in his coarse cotton robe of gray
officiated before the altar, and when the
last prayers were uttered the people
formed a procession to the Sumida riv
er, a short distance away.
Near a bridge an unusual craft was
waiting, a deep cargo junk roofed over
with canvas bearing bold black Bud
dhist symbols, and at the bow fluttered
a white cotton banner on which was
written in large black characters:
"A service to console the spirits of
the whole world's departed ones."
Quickly the parishioners embarked
and squatted down upon the cushions
spread over the bottom of the boat, and
the priest, the central figure in the re
ligious ceremony, as gray and faded as
the robes he wore, took up his position
in front of the altar. A piece of soiled
embroidery did duty for an altar cloth,
and there was set up a tarnished statue
of Jizo Sama. Just below were three
wooden tablets. The central one read.
"Pray for the whole world's departed
ones' souls." The others bail inscrip
tions asking for prayers for the Jap
anese army and for prayers for the
allies of Japan. * ^ -y —,
The priest placed some sweet scented
squares of incense upon the coals in a
small brass brazier, and as the clouds
rose into the air the boatman with his
bamboo pole pushed off from the shore
and the holy man's voice was heard
chanting—all the worshipers, old wom
en and young, men and children, mur
muring In an undertone. "Name Amlda
Butsu!"
Out upon the Sumida river the cere
mony of scattering the papers was be
gun. Old and young with their hands
full leaffed over the sides of the Junk,
throwing away the sacred papers with
the effigy of Jizo Sama stamped there
on, each meant for the solace of the
soul of some soldier slain In battle.
Those who have mourned dear ones
slairf in war would have been touched
to the quick by this simple service of
humble Japanese people given for all
that great host of unknown who have
laid down their lives for their countries
And. wllile the priest intoned, the in
cense rose into the air, the metal and
the wooden drums were beaten, the
worshipers chanted unceasingly, and
the squares of paper fluttered out of
the boat cn all sides and were carried
away by the wind over the water to
make a long wake behind the vessel.
For three hours the temple Junk
floated down the river, the papers fall
ing noiselessly over the waves as the
banks of the Sumida were passed.
A halt was made at noon, when thin
white wooden boxes filled with rice
and vegetables were brought out. while
an old woman brewed the tea over a
little charcoal Are.
The spot at which the stop had been
made was a sacred one, for in that ex
act place a Jizo Sama stone had been
buried under the water. Here after
the simple meal a special service was
held before the boat returned up
stream, and a long, narrow piece of
wood was driven Into the sandy bot
tom of the bay. The inscription upon
It read literally as follows.
"Herewith the service is held for the
whole world its departed soldiers to

Dents In Wood Furnitur».
When wood Is badly dented or
scratched It is often a problem to
know how to get rid of the marks.
This Is quite easy If the following
plan, suggested by the Scientific Amer
ican. is adopted. First of all fold a
piece of blotting paper at least four
times, then saturate with water, final
ly allowing the superfluous moisture to
drip away. Now heat a flatiron until
It Is about the warmth required for
laundry work. Place the damp blot
ting paper over the dent and press
firmly.with the Iron. As soon as the
paper dries examine the mark. it
will then be found that the cavity has
filled up to a surprising extent Where
the dent Is very deep a second or even
a third application on the lines Indi
cated might be tried. Sooner or later
even serious depressions can be drawn
up, and most people who have not
tried this plan will he surprised at the
result of the treatment. Itepollshing
will clear away even the slight, mark»
that might finally remain.
A Chinese Hero.
At Loping Hsien Is a statue draped
In full dress of a mandarin (the pu
ting or police master) named Chin,
who gave his life for the people. An
exile who was In the camp at Jao
chow and who owed the hsien (district
magistrate) a grudge, rode a black
horse to Loping and. having killed the
hsien. got back for the Jaochow roll
call next morning. As the murderer
could not he found orders came from
the capital that a large number of the
people should be killed. To prevent
this slaughter of Innocent folk the pu
ting, a good old man. said he stabbed
the hsien after a few words over the
wine cups, and ho was consequently
beheaded. No resident of the district
would deal the fatal blow, but an itin
erant cobbler or bamboo worker did It
for a reward of 40 taels. Tradition
adds that he was struck dead by llght
uing after leaving the execution ground.
Tennyson'» Tactlessness.
Several stories are told of Tennyson's
thoughtless speeches. "What fish 1»
this?" he once nsked his hostess where
he was dining. "Whiting." she re
plied. "Tlie meanest fish there Is,"
he remarked, quite unconscious that
he could haie wounded any one's feel
ings.
Yet his kindness of heart was such
that when his partridge was after
ward given him almost raw he ate
steadily through it for fear bis hostess
might he vexed.
On one occasion Tennyson was very
rude to Mrs. Brotherton, a neighbor at
Freshwater. The next day he came to
fief house with a grtfat cabbage under
each arm.
"I heard you like these, so I brought
them," he said genially. It was his
idea of a peace offering.
Quick Hitting.
Dr. White was once a champion box
er in Philadelphia. One day he nsked
a big teamster to move his wagon for
ward about two yards, hut the team
ster, instead of doing that, called the
physician a wicked name.
Like a flash White knocked him flat
in the gutter, and of course the team
ster had him arrested. Magistrate
Devlin heard the case, and the In
jured man complained bitterly that
Dr. White had struck him so quickly
he had no time to defend himself.
"Well." said the hardheaded magis
trate. "what did you expect him to do
—send you a postal card to tell yon
