several developments today in the sit
ua'tion preceding the filling cf the
vacancy by the president.
Stainback is in a receptive mood,
as Is also Circuit Judge C. W. Ash
ford, mentioned in local court circles
as the logical man for th bench.
Democrats are reported to be boost
ing for Attorney Harry Irwin, former
ly of Hilo. Judge Arthur Wilder was
mentioned this morning as a ossible
candidate by, one of the higncr-ups of
the territorial government, as was
also i Judge .W. . Edinge of Mautr
' In ; the opinion of many attorneys
and court officials. Judge Ashford ia
the logical man to succeed Justice
Watson. With 30 years experlenc3 at
the bar and with more than two years
on the bench," Judge Ashford may re
ceive the indorsement of the bar asso
ciation, aay those who profess, to
know., His familiarity wiUi local con
ditions and with history that has b'een
made In the islands during the last
40 years is said to be one of the im
portant points In his favor.

I know it or not If the members of the
bar feel that I am qualified Tor the
position, they are at liberty to say
so If Jhey care to.T 4
Attorney General Stainback smiled
this morning when asked if he is a
candidate for the position of associate
justice. .
T guess I am as much a candidate
as any of the rest of them," he said.
l "haven't applied for the position,
but I should probably accept it If of
fered to me."
Stainback has . been In the Islands
since 1912, coming here just after fin
ishing his coarse of law at the- Uni
versity of Chicago.. He finished at
Princeton In 1907. If named for the
place he would be one of tht young
est attorneys ever named to a state

TODAY ABSOLUTE
Absolute quarantine was declared
by the U. S. public health service on
the T. K. K. intermediate liner Per
sia Maru when she docked at Pier 16
at 10 o'clock this morning because a
Japanese steerage r passenger died
from a disease the ship's surgeon
calls beri-beri, but the exact nature
of which is not known. Because of
this Dr. P. E. Trotter, chief quaran
tine officer, took no chances.
No passengers were allowed ashore
except the 169 Asiatic steerage for
Honolulu, who were loaded into auto
trucks and taken to the quarantine
station. : The two first-cabin passen
gers for Honolulu were also removed
to the quarantine station with the
steerage. Freight brought by the
steamer was 1169 tons.
The man who died was taken ill at
8 a, m. November 26, a day after de
parture. He died at 9 o'clock that
night No detailed history of the case
or clinical notes were kept by the
ship'a surgeon, according to Dr. Trot
ter, which would help to determine
positively what the passenger was suf
fering with. It might have been some
thing more contagious that beri-beri,
so that Dr. Trotter could only enforce
absolute quarantine measures in the
circumstances.
At 8 o'clock tonight the Persia will
leave for San Francisco. She is a
day late because of stormy weather.
The steamer arrived off port ' at 11
o'clock last night. '

Cook Who Struck Mrs. G.
W. R.King
John Huihul, blclycle officer of the
police department, dropped dead
shortly before 1 o'clock this afternoon,
just after he had arrested a Japanese
cook, alleged to have beaten Mrs.
George W. R. King, wife of the deputy
auditor of the territory, at the KJng
residence, 918 Twelfth avenue, Kai
muki. . ' ..."
The Japanese is now under arrest
at the police station, brought into the
city by Deputy Sheriff Asch and Dep
uty Auditor King, both of whom ac
companied Huihui to Kaimukl.
It was about noon when King sent
word to the police that the Japanese
rook, a strong man, had struck Mrs.
King twice. Huihul was detailed to
go out to Kaimukl and get the man
and Deputy Sheriff Asch took a police
car, and, with King and the bicycle
officer, rushed out to the residence.
Just before getting there, at the foot
of the Kaimukl hill the car broke
down, but Asch hailed a passing taxi
and continued the trip. ,
Arriving at the hous, they were In
formed that the Japanese had gone
to Eleventh avenue. They hurried
there and saw the Japanese walking
along. Then King and Huihul jumped
out and Huihul grabbed the man and
put him und r arrest. Just as he
started to put the man in the machine,
Huihul dropped dead; supposedly of
heart failure. - " -
Huihul had been in the department
since April 22, 1912, and leaves a
; wife, and, it Is understood, several
children. Capt. Baker . immediately
went to the officer's home in the Mc

Larrison stated today in. announcing

next legislature through which the
territorial and - federal governments
institute a complete topographic sur
vey of the island of Maul and of parts
of Mauna Loa, the latter to be used

General Comment
The members of the Hawaiian Sug

ecutive session this morning in their
rooms in the Bank of Hawaii build
ing for a disenxsion of various mat
ters which hive arisen during the
past year relative to the manage
ment of the plantations, labor and
bonus problems, the growing of cane
and the manufacture of . the sugar
and rneens of Improving conditions
were taken up and talked over. The
meeting was not open to the public.
Following the meeting Georg Ro
dlek, the newly elected president of
the association, said that the commit
tees for the ensuing year would not
be chosen until some time alter the
meeting. -' ' '
This afternoon at 1:C0 the members
again took up the discussion of the
reports, those remaining being, 'Ware
houses and Storage of Raw Sugar,
"Labor Savin? Devices," "Bagasse
Pulp and Paper" and "Forestry."
New Discovery Wakes Interest . '
The new process, discovered by. J.
N. S. Williams, of recovering sugar
from final molasses, which up to this
time was considered impossible, a
report cn which was read by Willi
ams Wednesday : afternoon at the
meetlh? of the association, is caus
ing much comment - today : by , local
business and sugar men as it is con
sidered onef - the -most imf;artaiit
finds of ' recent years. ? Its ' Value . td
the sugar growers on this year's aver
age figures Is over $2,500,000 and as
the cost of machinery necessary tor
its manufacture is small. It la ex
pected that many of the plantations
will try it out - as soon as possible.
The amount obtained is one and one
eighth per cent, which formerly .was
believed absolutely lost ? . ,
The new process worked out by Wil
liams is to boil the final molasses un
til It is practically free of water and
then remove the sucrose by a high
speed centrifugal. This sucrose, the
re.port says, can then be converted in
to commercial sugar. :

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. T.
Germany's contentions by which that
government justifies the submarining
of the P. & O. liner Arabia were made
public today by Secretary of State
Lansing. :
The sinking of the British liner
brings up a situation in which Ger-:
many has already asked the United
status of the vessel, while it is un
derstood that Washington has asked
Berlin for a statement of the circum
stances surrounding the sinking.
Germany's contentions in brief ire
that the Arabia was a "troop transport
in the service of the British, and con
sidered an auxiliary warshfp, accord
ing to international law." - t
' Secretary Lansing emphasizes, how-
AA .tilt.. J . M
ever, mat uermanj aimuug is uuo
of readiness to make amends in the
event that it is shown that the com
mander of the submarine violated
Germany's pledge . to the United
States . ' . :
It Is understood that - the United
States does ; not regard the clrcum-.
stances surrounding the sinking of the
liner to be such as the German note
recites aa showing justification for
slnklne the steamer without warning.
No action will be taken by the United
