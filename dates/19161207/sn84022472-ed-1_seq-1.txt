.to; the note . of 'the 21st -ultimo, that
the lnvestigaion conduced, by the Ger

led t6 the following results:-
"Onthe morning of November 6th,
a 'German submarine encountered a
.large steamer coming from the Corigo
Straits, 100 naval miles wept of the
Island , of Corigo. . The. steamer was
" painted , black and had a blaek, super
structure and not,jas'is otherwise the
case, with P. &0. line superstructures,
a light color. The steamer, which was
identical rwith., the Arabia, rwas not
travelling on the route regularly used
by ' the passenger ' steamers ' between
Port Said And .Malta, as Js made plain
byjthe J enclosed map, but" was taking

This course, on which the submarine
passed " three similar steamers at the

however,: to support any government
pledged vigirously to prosecute the

. The opinion is expressed that not
jless than three labor members will be
included in the negotiations. '
Few, if any Liberal members of Mr.

some of the Unionist members', like

Provincial Liberal newspapers like

Liberals to give the government a fair

that it is the embodiment of British

cording to one estimate, Mr. Lloyd
George can rely on the support oi
virtually the Union-ist members and of
the 70 Liberals, and hopes, to obtain
the backing of the Labor members,

"In the circumstances, the com
mander of the submarine was con
vinced that in the case of this steamer
he was concerned with a transport ship
for, troops in the .service of. the British
government which . is to be considered
as an auxiliary warship according to.
international law and can, therefore,.
be treated like a warship. .He . ac
cordingly considered himself Justified
in attacking the steamer without de
lay and sank it, r.
"Should the American government
give official data showing that the Ar
abia was at the time to be an ordinary
passenger steamer, the action of the
commander would not have been in
accordance, .with the instructions given
him, since these instructions are now
as before in agreement, with- the as
surances of the German note of May,

regrettable, mistake from which the
German government would promptly

EXONERATED BY
CORONER PHELAN
Miss Ruth Hall Not to
Blame For Fatal Auto
Accident.
Miss Ruth Hall, the Fairfield school
teacher, was not criminally responsi
ble for the death of Elizabeth O'Con
nell, according to a finding made to
day by Coroner John J. Phelan. He
finds that Miss Hall was not driving
her automobile recklessly at the time
it struck and fatally injured Mrs.
O'Connell on December 1.
Four witnesses summoned by the
coroner agreed that Mrs. O'Connell
looked toward the machine as she
tried to cross State street at the inter
section . of Hancock avenue. They
thought she must have heard the horn
and was trying to get across in front
of the automobile. There was a jit
ney near the corner at the time of
the . accident and this obscured Miss
Hall's view of the street somewhat.
The testimony indicated, however,
that she was not driving fast.

Strain on Young Financier
Great, He Will Receive
Skilled Help.
A' committee of the most able bank
ers to be found in New York has been
selected to assist Marcellus Hartley
Dodge, the young financier who con
ceived and executed the formation of
the Remington Arms & Ammunition
Co. and later the Remington Arms
Union Metallic Cartridge Co.,- in the
operation of the vast plants here and
its subsidiaries throughout the coun
try. '
As announced at the New York of
fices of the company the men who
form the new executive committee are
G. M. P. Murphy, treasurer of the
Guaranty Trust Co.; James H. Pl
kins, vice president of the Natial
City bank; W, E. S. Griswold and
Samuel F. Pryor, who have been asso
ciated with the management of the
company since its inception. . .
Though little is known today of the
plans of 'the committee it is a well es
tablished fact that financiers for some
months have watched the manage
metn of Mr. Dodge, and have won
dered how he was able to . stand the
nervous strain that . naturally would
attach to the conduct 'of such' a .vast
enterprise with its wide, ramifications,
of : finance, production and sale of out
put to various governments.
It is believed that the strain told so
heavily upon Mr. podge that he. was
finally compelled - to associate with
himself in the management brilliant
financiers who will be able to gve him
advice from their years- of experience.
That there will be little cnange in
the present conduct of the business in
thjs'City is thought likely by th,ose in
close touch with the Internal situation

' Through the' National City Bank,
Mr. Dodge sold last February $15,
000,000 of two year 5 per cent, notes.
Later the company placed $10,000,000
of notes through the . same source.
Both the Guaranty Trust and the Na
tional City Bank interests were 'close
ly associated r'in the formation of the
company, as well as-., the Midvale

Death of Massachusetts
Woman in This City.
Complaints to the police, health de

have been made following the death
Sunday of ; Mrs. Cestalva Melinozky
of Hatfield, Mass.
Allegations are made by Thomas
Melinoszky, her husband, and other
relatives that she was the victim of a
woman . quack's advice. . They are
wroth because, the incantations the
latter is said to have made at . Mrs.
Melinoszky's, bedside failed to have
any effect after they had paid. $35'
for the treatment. - , - ., .
According to the t.ory told the po
lice, who referred the case of the
health department, whicih did the
same to the county health officer, Mrs.
Melinoszky was seriously ill of. tub
erculosis in Hatfield. Her relatives
came to this city and sought out a
woman practitioner whose name, as
near- as the health authorities can
ascertain, is Mrs. M. A. Rudka.
They wanted her to go to Hatfield
and cure Mrs. Melinoszky. It was too
far, . she t. said, but sne promised to
treat the victim provided she were
brought here. The family transport
ed J Mrs.Melinoszky to the Roseville
section of Fairfield, and the treat
ment was. begun, with a promise that
$150 be paid, $35 down.
' The treatment, the complainants
said, "was mostly in the form of mys
terious prayers. It didn't help mat
ters any and late last week Dr. J. C.
Lynch was called into the case. He
found that the woman was in the last
stages of tuberculosis and would not
live more than 48 hours.
She was buried day before yester
day. On the suspicion that the wom
an doctor is not a legal practitioner,
in investigation will be made by the
health authorities. County Health

DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE:
PERPETRAT
Real Estate Operator Coolly Planned Murder of Partner,
Detective and Woman, Romero Tells Police Relates
Remarkable Tale of Wholesale Swindling of Banks
and Investors by Clever Culprit, Now in Hospital
Authorities Accumulate Facts Concerning Acts of
Halliday.
Driven to desperation by his knowledge of the fact that tho
police were slowly but surely weaving about him a web of evi-1
dence, relating to his fraudulent real estate dealings, sharp prac-1
tices by which unsuspecting women were mulcted of their sav
ings, William Halliday, of 103 Garfield avenue, real estate oper
ator, contractor and builder intended to kill three people who
had knowledge of his illegal acts, the police charged today.
The life and death struggle at his home yesterday, in which
he is charged with attempting to kill Francis Romero, his part
ner and pliant tool, but which ended in his being shot by the lat-r
ter three times, was part of the plan he had evolved, which he
thought would free him from the clutching tenacles of the law.
He had stated his intention of killing Romero, a woman and a
police officer. . 1
, The amazing career, of Halliday in this city, since he came
here two years ago, his frenzied financial schemes, which dim
in boldness of design the tales of "Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford,"
were about to culminate in his arrest for alleged arson, theft,
embezzlement and other charges which would send him to jail
for a long term of years, the authorities state.- . !
He was aware of these facts. Three
persons Knew of, and could prove his
guilt. They were his partner, a lo
cal detective and a woman. Although
he had often scoffed at the law and
bluntly stated, owing to his past:' acts,
"that he could get away with any
thing in Bridgeport," he knew he was
at' the end of his rope, and his ar
rest hung threateningly over his head
like the sword of Damocles.
Yesterday he appeared with" three
deeds for Romero to sign. The lat
ter refused, and admitted he had con
sulted the police and a lawyer. Halli
day followed him to police headquar
ters Tuesday ard knew Romero was
-.!,-.,. mitti ttifl -rvoHce. . Alone In
the liouBe 'yesterday he seized on this
opportunity 4 to ' carry, out part of his
plan, but Romero fighting as only a
man facing death, can" fight, foiled his
.plan.," - '." .'. ,' ', " .'
: By degrees the startling life led toy
Halliday is coming to. light, but his ex
treem' cleverness, his knowledge of
the law, have so complicated his acts
that even real estate experts, and
bank officials called in by the police
to straighten out the. evidence admit
that thus far Halliday has them com
pletely baffled.
He is under arrest at St. Vincent s
hospital, charged with attempt to
murder Romero, and when discharged
from the institution will be. also
charged "with causing . the incendiary
fire which destroyed the home of Mrs.
Minnie Gilbert, purchased by her and
burned to the ground on the same
day. Nov. 23. - She ad-; bought the
house from Halliday. who lives next
door. . -. k - .
The police have in their .possession
evidence of the culpability of Halli
day. In the deeds and papers con
nected with the sale, it is . stated that
Halliday agreed to have "the house
completely finished by the. first of
January. This he knew he could not
do. The police claim he had repre
sented the house as being almost fin
ished,' when as a matter of fact, it
was only the skeleton of a dwelling.
He obtained from her $1,000. If
he failed to have completed the con
struction of the dwelling by the new
year he was to forfeit , $65 monthly
of-the $6,500, purchase price until it
was in a habitable state. .
The . police say he figured he had
'a "thousand cold in his pocket."
Mrs. Gilbert had obtained the trans
fer of the insurance of $2,000. Hence
he would burn it down releasing him
from further responsibility and, con
trary to previous dealings, his client
would gain and not . lose $1,000,
through the insurance.
Romero has told the police all
about this affair. Inspector Holbrook
went to Mrs. Gilbert to look over her
papers. . He found the agreements
properly worded but Mrs. Gilbert
had "been duped. Halllday's signa
ture was nowhere , on the papers.
Then an attorney came to. the police
tp complain. A widow had given to
Halliday $700 to purchase a house,
taking a mortgage for the rest of the
cost price. She had legal papers ga
lore, but found later that Halliday
had in no place affixed his signature
and she had no receipt to show for
her $700. Halliday gave her, the
"cold shoulder" when she went to
see him. She then appealed to the
attorney, who for three ,weeks has
ho0n trvinsr to obtain the money.
Bank officials were buncoed in the
city by Halliday, notary "publics fooled
in a manner , which brings a laugh,
even from the police. Romero, posing
as one. of three fictitious persons, re
lates how they have often entered the
office of notary publics hv the city.
Halliday would tell Romero, ' Now,
vou make believe to sign this arter we
get the notary seal on the papers, but
dont put any name on it."
Thev would enter the office, get tne
notary to put his seal on the legal pa
cers, and while Romero pretented to
append his signature, Halliday would
engage the notary in conversation,
turn suddenly and say to Romero,
"All signed?" reach over, pick up the
papers, put them in hi pocket and
walk out. .
Just what action Halliday had for
this action is not clear. The ponce
state that to fathom his dealings with'
the banks and his clientele will take
experts. The trouble which led, to

home, and an investigation of that fire
by Detective Holbrook,4 Romero began
to fear for his life and ..liberty. He
went to the police and related to De
tective Holbrook his : relations with;
Halliday. He stated his . partner was.
a clever man. schooled in the law, on?
who would stop at nothing to gain hi
ends, while he was but an illiterate
Spaniard, a figurehead in the busi
ness.' - ,
Romero told the police he knew Hal--liday
was heavily in debt, and that
creditors were pressing ; him on -all
sides. They were involved in real es
tate deals involving about 50,000. Hal
liday unfolded a , plan to ; Romero
whereby they could beat the creditors
in a planner which ne-x,lained a
"perfectly within the iw. '
He had Romero pose as "John Mar
tinea," VJ. K. White," and "J J. CaJ
beral," on a hundred different occa
sions. Halliday would obtain deeds to
properties or acquire real estate. . He
would .then .transfer the property to a
flcti'tiois' person, under . one of- these
three names, Romero always appear
ing before the attorneys or whoever
transferred the deed as "White,
'CalberalV or "Martinez."
If the creditors attempted 'to - flnl
the person supposed to own the prop
erty .or to ascertain if . Halliday had
an equity that was being ' concealed,
they naturally hunted in vain!
, Tuesday Romero had an appoint
merit with DetecUve' Holbrook at po
lice headquarters. , He called Hol
brook on the 'phone and told him!
Halliday was following him, and he
did not dare metet the detective. Hol
brook stated he would wait all after
noon for him and Romero, thinking
he had evaded Halliday, arrived at
police headquarters about 4 o'clock.
