PAT QUINLAN
IS RELEASED
FROM PRISON
Served All Hut Eleven WecJtl of Sen
tence for Saying too Much
Tat Quinlun is a free man again,
and every one is glad, even the Pater
son "cops" who sent him away to the
New Jersey state's prison for nearly
two years.
There wasn't much of a demonstra
tion for him when Judge Abrain Klen
it him tVee in the Psterson couvt.
Yet when an old broken Irishman
came to him and shook hajsda, saying.
"We're all happy to see you agin," it
about summed it up.
Pat took it quietly. He blinked a
few titr.es at the judge, had a time to
keep the peace when he was advised
by Klenert to be more careful in the
future, and then the ordeal was over.
Mrs. Anna M. Sloan, of New York,
trotted up the clerk of court and
turned over $500 which was collected !
f om people in New York to pay his
fine. This took about two seconds, and
Qainlan walked out with a crowd at
his back.
Big Fund for Quintan
The court room was empty when
the Socialists left, and Judge Klenert
had a quiet grin of satisfaction about
his regal face as they filed out.
Later, a big handful of bills was
turned over to Quinlan, which was
collected from Socialists, as a slight
recompense for the two years of life
that had been spent behind prison
bars.
He served all but 11 weeks of his
two years' sentence, the minimum of
his term. The charge against him was
of high misdemeanor, resulting from
making an alleged inflammatory
speech at a meeting of silk weavers in
the Paterson silk strike of 1913.
He came down from Trenton with
Warden Patrick Hughes, who treated
him more like a friend than a prisoner
about to be set free. At Newark sta
tion he got the first welcome from
Milo C. Jones, secretary of the Social
ist Party of New Jersey; Fred Har
wood, an old friend.
Is Pretty Soft Yet
"I'm pretty 'soft' yet," he said. His
face was a bit sunken and pale from
the long imprisonment, otherwise he
appeared to be in good health. He
didn't like the idea of having to de
pend on judicial clemency to be liber
ated. I
The fact that he could spend the
holidays with friends appealed to him,
otherwise he would have been just as
glad to stay out the 11 weeks more \
and have served his sentence. That's
Pat's makeup.
He spoke about the many firends he
had among the convicts, and in partic
ular of one keeper, "as white a man
as you'll meet," he said. Quinlan car
ried a lot of messages to bring to
friends of the convicts. One was con
cealed in his shoe.
"The 'cons' expect me either to set
the jail on fire or do what Osborne
did to Sing Sing," he remarked, as
the party was walking to take the car
for Paterson. "But, of course, they
exaggerate. It comes from long con
finement. The long timers get simple,
first, and finally go crazy."
Has Contract Labor Facts
He had few complaints to make
about the prison. Under Warden
Hughes improvements were being
made. The cells are more spacious
than Sing Sing, but the food is very
poor. He had a lot of information,
however, about prison contract labor
that he intends to write about.
"There's a shirt manufacturer who
has shirts made by the convicts, work
ing under contracts, who puts the
union label on them," he said.

DAMAGE CLAIMS
FOR $150,001)
Widows* of Deputies Sue the City of
Seattle lor Death of Husbands
in Everett.
Damage claims amounting to |160,
--000 have been filed in Seattle against
that city by deputies and widows of
deputies as a result of the battle here,
November 5, on the City Dock be
tween 1. W. W.s and deputies.
Mrs. Charles O. Curtiss asks $50,
--000 for the death of her husband who
was Mcßae's second in command at
the time of the battle. He was shot
through the neck and instantly killed.
Mis. Jefferson Beard demands $50,
--000 for the death of her deputy hus
band. He received a bullet through
the. lung and died several days after
the battle.
H. B. Blackburn, another deputy, is
sueing the city for $25,000 for having
to spend a few weeks in the hospital.
Elmer Buehrer, who was a special
deputy, got a piece of lead in his chest
and is sueing for $25,000.
Seattle is held responsible because
: it allowed the boat load of I. W. W.s
to leave Seattle, with the object (?)
of creating trouble.
Seattle's mayor and several of her
officials and thousands of citizens
have expressed themselves very forci
bly about the actions of the author
ities of the city of Everett and this
move is for the purpose of having
Seattle hold its tongue. j
The truth hurts and the Everett ■
authorities thought they were going
to get away with the lies they peddled ,
about the battle and the causes lead- i
ing thereto. But the truth got out, in !
fact it had been out for some time, :
and it was an easy matter to tell who j
was to blame for the bloody battle.
Passenger Sues For ?.)0,000
Carlson, one of the passengers on
the Verona started the ball rolling by j
sueing several deputies, the City Dock ,
Co. and the owners of the Verona for j
a total of $50,000. Carlson was shot
nine times and still lives and he says ;
he was not an I. W. W. but a passeng
er on the Verona. |
The deputies arid their friends had
to retaliate somehow so they decided
to sue the city of Seattle as that was
the only place they could get money .
from. But we cannot see how they
have any thing coming. They were j
there for trouble, they started the
trouble and it so happened that some
|of them got a little more than they
I expected. They should now be behind j
the bars, but justice is blind . :
VAN LEAR ADVOCATES
PRACTICAL POLITICS
Socialist Mayor-Elect of .Minneapolis
in Talk Gives Advice to
Party Members
Thomas Van Lear, Socialist mayor
elect of Minneapolis, delivered a mes
sage of advice to the party in a speech
at the Rand School of Social Science.
The affair was a reception in honor of
Van Lear.
fie was introduced hy Algernon
Lee, Socialist candidate for governor
n the recent election.
"What the Socialist Party needs
now," said Van Leav, "is a school in
practical politics. A great many por
ous object to the phrase 'practical
politics.' However, if we don't find
some way to meet the old-time politi
cians on their own battle ground and
overcome them, the Socialist Party
will never amount to very much.
"Because of this lack of knowledge
of piactical politics the party lost the
last two mayoralty elections preceding
my election. One was stolen. The
other was taken from us hy a piece of
political trickery.
"We knew so little than that we
thought all we had to do was to con
vince the people that they ought to
vote for us, and then we could go
home and go to bed."
Van Lear bestowed high compli
ments upon the Rand School, mention
ing that he had seen many brilliant
products of the school throughout the
co ■i. 11 y.

Gov, l>. M. dough, after disposing
of the mallei of The Northwest
Worker, decided that he would quell
the rising i eholliousness of his strike
breakers by throwing them a few
more bones from his table. So he post
ed lip a notice outside his mill to the
effect that on December 1 upright
sawyers would get a raise of 1 cent
per thousand and packer.; '- a cent
pei- thousand. In doing tin-; the honor
| able gentleman (7) males the state
ment that he is doing it because of
the "kindly feeling that exists be
; tween our pie.-en! employes and our
' companies" and because they ought to
have a little more of that prosperity
that is talked of so much.
After this munificent gift the
shingle mill slaves were expected to
do some praising and lo! ami behold,
they did. The "boys" got together anil
drew up I?) the following letter
which was duly received by Gov. I).
M. Clough:
"To I). M. dough, Manager of
dough-Hartley Shingle Co.!
"Dear Sir We, the undersigned
'employes of the Clough-Hartley

i preciation for the voluntary advance
in wages o'i your part, unsolicited on
our part, and may our future rela
itions be as just.and prosperous as <mr
I past since we have been in your em-
I ploy.
"Wishing you and your associates a
imerry Christmas and a happy, pros
m ous new yi a-, we remain,
"Sincerely yours."
The letter is supposed to have been
j signed by <>(> of the strike breakers.
You will note how they almost fell
abut one another's necks in express
ing appreciation of such a kindly and
i enevolent act. We think that the
move in make is for the Everett
'". imercial Club to write to Car-
in an endeavor to get dough an
'h. ro" medal. Such noble acts should
not be overlooked by such a prominent
: body of citizens.
Eut listen! The governor can hand
out molasses as well as the other fel
lov, and so in reply to his first letter
to himself he writes a second, appar
ently to his slaves in the bull pen, but
: mostly for the benefit of the "deer
Ipcepul" at large. The "valuable" doc
ument follows: '
"Gentlemen—Your letter of appre
ciation for our voluntary increase of
wages, unsolicited by yourselves, was
just handed me by our superintend
ent, Mayor Jones.
"You cannot imagine how pleased
i I was to receive this. It is always a
great pleasure to give, but escpecially
to those who thoroughly appreciate
what has been given. Of course, this
j was not a donation on our part; I con
ide 'ed you justly earned it.
"There is no flattery in what I say,
but you <■><; gentlemen who have signed
this letter arc certainly as good work
men as ever were in our employ, and
you have certainly been good, honest,
true-blue gentlemen from first to
last.
"Again I want to thank yon for
your appreciation, and wishing you
i all and your families a merry Christ-
Imas and a happy new year, I am
"Sincerely your friend,
"D. M. CLOUGH."
i Now the "gentlefen" to whom this
letted was addressed must have felt
hij lily flattered. But again we know
that they were not. Some of the "gen

GERMANY DEPORTS
300,000 BELGIANS
Vandervelde Sends Protests to Inter
national Socialist Bureau
Members
II WRH. -Emile Vandervelde, min
ister of munitions in the Belgian cabi
net and president of the International
Socialist bureau, has written to the
members of the committee concerning
the deportations of Belgian working
men to Germany, as follows:
"We might have believed that after
submitting to invasion with its vio
lences and occupation with its mis
eries our people had suffered all that
a people could suffer, but worse was
still to come. Despairing of being able
to keep that which H had taken in dis
regard of its faith and its word, the
German government appears deter
mined to treat the Belgians as the
conquered were treated in the age of
Assyria and Babylon.
"We received every day at Havre
messages which make our hearts
bleed. The deportations in Flanders,
at Charleroi, at Mons and in the larg
est part of the country are more nu
merous and agonizing. The men are
of every age and condition but partic
ularly youths and workingmen.
"They are gathered up, herded and
numbered like cattle and taken as
•captives into other provinces, into
northern France and into Germany,
1 without their kindred knowing where
| they are taken. They are forced to
make fortifications, to construct stra
tegic railways, to make cement and
other materials used in building
trenches or to replace in other work
laborers who are being sent to the
front or into munition works."
Minister Vandervelde said that the
Belgian minister at The Hague tele
graphed November 17 that more than
300,000 Belgians had already been de
ported and that the German authori
ties had posted orders in Brussels an
nouncing that the deportation of men
from the capital would commence on
November 18. In his letter the Belgian
Socialist leader cites an article of The
Hague convention of 1907 prohibiting
belligerents from forcing enemy na
tionals to participate in operations of
war against their country.

SPOKESMAN FOR THE ONLY USEFUL CLASS IN SOCIETY—THE WOJIKINf; CLASS
PERSECUTION
OF FREE SPEECH
PRISONERS
Latest News of the Everett Fight and
Commercial Club Activities
As a final result of the weeding out
process among the men imprisoned
because of their activities in the at
tempt, to secure the rights of Free
Speech in Everett, Wash., there are
now 74 in juil in Kverett charged
with first degree murder and 35 in
the King county jail in Seattle charg
ed with unlawful assemblage. The 86
men are the passengers on the "Cal-
Ista" which never reached Everett,
but turned back half way when warn
ied by the returning "Verona."
Attorney Fred H. Moore, of Lo:>
Angeles, Cal., famous in many labor
cases, is on the job acting for the men
in Seattle and Kverett. Col. C. E. S.
Wood, of Portland, Ore., is also act
ing in the case in an advisory capac
ity.
The men in jail in Everett are be
ing constantly subjected to petty per
secution. They have all been photo
graphed and finger-printed by offi
cials of the State Hoard of Prisons,
although yet unconvicted! This was
made the excuse for not letting At
torney Moore into the jail on Friday,
the 24th. He was not allowed to see
his own clients! Prosecutor Webb
tried to get Moore into the jail, but
Sheriff McKae was implacable.
This same sheriff also refused to
allow any dainties to be sent into the
jail for the boys on Thanksgiving.
Friends of the men and local sympa
thizers had planned to send them a
Thanksgiving dinner. But, out of
sheer malice and gratuitous brutality,
the sheriff forbade the food being
given the men. This has but added to
the growing sentiment in Everett
against the sheriff and the prosecu
tion. The daily press of Everett is
completely under the sway of the lum
ber interests, it seems. For instance,
the Everett Herald of November 29
says that Attorney Fred Moore tasted
I the prison food and praised it highly.
This article actually states that Moore
said that the prisoners were "given
as good food anil as much of it as
they could wish." When Moore saw
this "interview" in the paper he was
astounded. The story was a deliberate
piece of misrepresentation. Disclaim
ers have been sent to the Everett pa
pers, but have not been printed.
Oscar Carlson, the passenger on
the "Verona" who was shot in nine
places when the Everett thugs poured
their volleys into the crowded decks
of the steamer, has had action for
damages brought against the steam
ship company, the Everett Dock com
pny, Sheriff Donald Mcßae and sev
eral other leaders of the Commercial
Club mob. He claims compensation to
the extent of $50,000 for the damages
done by the anti-free-speech thugs.
Seventy-four murder cases, 35 un
lawful assemblage cases and the case
of Kilith Frenette, a free-speech sym
pathizer charged with assault and in
tent to kill—such is the full tale of
the legal battles looming in the near
future. The providing of an adequate
defense for all these workingmen will
cost a great deal of money. There is
only one source to which we can ap
ply for aid: the working class. It was
for the rights of the working class
to express its views and to organize
I that five men met their death so nobly
on Bloody Sunday, November 5. It is
for the same cause that these men are
now in prison. The masters will try to
j railroad them. We must defend our
own! Shall these men be railroaded
to the penitentiary for life because
I they said that labor should not be
gagged ? Workers, it is for YOU to
say!
Send all contributions to the North
west Worker, Everett.
Protests and resolutions should be

RANGE STRIKE
CASES ON TRIAL
All Charges Against Miners Framed
Up by Tools of Steel Trust
Besides the murder charges against
eight strikers and organisers of the
lion Miners' strike, there remains a
numher of lesser cases which are be
ing heard at present. These were sift
ed out of the 000 arrests made by
deputize! gunmen the steel trust im
ported to break thf strike. The in
| dictments are for alleged rioting, as
sault and kindred charges growing
out of picketing. In themselves these
cases are not of great importance;
yet they indicate the relentless atti
I tude of the state when its forces ai <
j prostituted to the desires of organ
ized capital.
In the case of Joe Blago, on trial
for assaulting a deputy, Prosecuto
Funk called for the state a 14-year
old boy from whom, previous to trial
he had secured a statement—he writ
ing the statement and having the bo.
I .sign it while under his influence and
in his presence. Upon taking the
stand the lad was admonished by the
court as to the nature of an oath and
as a consequence absolutely corrobo
| rated the testimony of witnesses for
the defense. Funk then brought out
the statement and, failing in his en
! deavor to intimidate the lad with it,
I tried to have it admitted over the
, boy's sworn testimony. He was pre
vented by the court upon objection.
Funk then asked for conviction be
cause Blago was a foreigner. The
jury then brought in a compromise
verdict of simple assault instead of
assault in the second degree, as
charged.
Last week Eli Monovich, Rafael
Pette and Steve Dronjak were tried
for rioting. The state attempted to
lay base for further prosecution for
I assault to kill as, on the day of the
riot, Martin Teller, local chief of the
Oliver gunmen, was stabbed slightly
when attacking the picket line. Teller
told the doctor who dressed his wounds
that he did not see who cut him and
didn't know he was hurt till after
ward; yet he had a story to tell the
jury, identifying Dronjak as the one
who had stabbed him. All the trusty
henchmen of the operators had the
same general story. However a few
conflicting things they had over
looked caused the jury to discredit
their story entirely, its verdict exon
erating the prisoners from violence,
inciting to violence or carrying weap
ons. Regardless of this, possibly be
cause some juror, for reasons best
known to himself, hung out for con
viction, the jury judged Pette and
Dronjak guilty of rioting. Defendants
having been clubbed and having suf
fered some imprisonment, apparently
the jury decided a little more of the
same wouldn't make much difference
to them.
It was also shown that the depu
ties were so irresponsible that they
clubbed one another during the ex
citement and that the fight was pre
cipitated by a scab who had evidently
arranged with the deputies to "start
something" among the pickets.
One is reminded of the Industrial
Relations Commission's report,
wherein is stated that, "In some lo
calities the control by employers of
the entire machinery of government
is such that lawless acts on the part
of the agents of employers go un
punished, while vindictive action
against leadess of the strike is accom
plished by methods unparalleled in
civilized countries."
The United States Steel Corpora
tion has announced a general raise of
wages. Does any one imagine this
labor-hating crew has experienced a
change of heart ? Or does it fear that
all workers in the steel industry may
join with the miners now organized in
the next fight with their exploiter?
Does the Steel Trust wish to excul
pate itself before working its murder
ous will upon Sam Scarlett, Joe
Schmidt and Carlo Tresca?

EXPLOITERS OF
LABOPi GET SORE
'Governor (lough Orders Printer to
Stop Printing Northwest
Worker
Governor Clough, president of the
I Clough-Jfartiey Lumber and Shingle
I Co., along with other parasites in the
i manufacturing and lumber business,
•eem to have lost all respect for The
Northwest Worker.
This paper has been trying to tell
the truth about the recent troubles in
Everett, but it seems that the truth
is not to the liking of the honorable
gentlemen ( ?).
It seems that printers have stom
achs and that, like other human be
ings, must eat to live and work to eat.
Knowing this, Gov. Clough decided to
give Kane & Harcus, who printed our
paper, a chance to choose between do
ing work for The Northwest Worker
or for the Lumber and Shingle inter
ests, and the printers chose the lat
ter, and out we went.
Well, we are here, anyhow, and we
will continue to stay in the field as
long as we can get a printer nearby
to do our work. The lumber baron;;
may lock horns with us, but we can
assure them that they will have to do
a whole lot of tussling to get the bet
ter of us. The suppression of a news
paper does not suppress the news bo
cause our "message," the message of
a rebellious working claas, can travel
faster and further by word of mouth
than can the printed word. The lum
ber barons are playing a losing : a
hence we can expect them to use des
perate methods, but.those same meth
ods will only quicken their downfall.
The rebellious portion of the working
class do not expect to break the
chains of wage slavery by means of a
magic wand. They expect to have to
fight every inch of the way. They ex
pect such obstacles as the above. They
expect to be clubbed, jailed, shot and
hung, but that does not deter them,
for they know that "he who would be
free, himself must strike the blow,"
and so after the parasitic plutocrats
have done their damndest, ir will be
all the more humiliating to them to
I -cc labor come out of the sc-an tri
umphant. So in the words of the
Scotch poet we say, "lay on McDuff
and damned be he who first cries,
hold! enough."
MILLIONAIRES
FLOURISH IN U.S.
They and the Multis Increased 25 and
50 Per Cent During the Year
of 1915
WASHINGTON— million
aires are increasing in number under
present conditions at the rate of near
ly 25 per cent a year, according to
figures in the annual report of W. H.
Osborn, commissioner of internal rev
enue, issued recently.
The rate among multimillionaires
is even greater, amounting to nearly
50 per cent.
The report shows that for the cal
endar year 1915, 329 persons paid
taxes on net incomes of more than
$500,000 a year. In 1914, taxes were
collected on only 174 incomes of more
j than $500,000 a year.
Incomes of more than $1,000,000 a
year for 1915 were reported by 120
persons. Of these, 74 were in New
York, ten in Pennsylvania, seven in
New Jersey; six in Ohio and four
each in Illinois, Connecticut and Dela
ware. Most of the states noted are
locations of the most extensive pro
duction of war munitions.
In 1915 were reported 122 incomes
between $400,000 and $500,000, in
1914 only 69. A similar increase was
noted in the number of incomes rang
ing from $15,000 to $400,000 a year.
The total receipts of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1916, were $512,723,
--287.77, the greatest in the nation's
history. Of this $76,972,720,88 was
collected us income tax from corpora
tions, and $67,943,594.63 as individual
income tax.
