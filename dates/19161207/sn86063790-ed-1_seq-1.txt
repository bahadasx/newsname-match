Ehrhardt Etchings.
Ehrhardt, Dec. 5.?We had quite
a wet, sloppy day for Thanksgiving,
as it rained all day until about four
o'clock when the sun came out. Those
who, had expected to enjoy the holiday'
shooting birds got a good disappointment.
Everything passed off
quietly, most all of the stores were
closed, postoffice was open most of
the time, the banks were at rest, and
services were held at the Lutheran
church in the afternoon by the pastor,
Rev. E. F. K. Roof.
Last Wednesday night Mr. E. P.
Copeland obeyed a psychic impulse
and went down to his store about one
o'clock. When he opened the door
he was surprised to find it possessed
by a burglar. The thief ran out a
side window, where he made the en
trance, and as he had one of the
lights burning Mr. Copeland saw him
, before he could make his get-away.
Some time during the evening before
"the store closed, he slipped the key
out of the bolt that bars the window
and had no trouble in getting in. He
seemed not to want more than
enough to enjoy, but just one day
(Thanksgiving). He had fixed up
and had on the counter near the window
about 8 packs of cigarettes, one
dozen cigars, one pound of candy,
one pound of cheese, four pounds of
sausage. But the poor fellow had to
leave it and not offer any thanks for
his bountiful (lost) Thanksgiving
dinner. Mr. Copeland will not tell
the man's name, but says he is a
white married man - and resides in
town.
Messrs. John Hartz and A. B. Coggins

New York to Macon, Ga., for a New
York athletic club, on a $10,000
wager. He has 28 days more to get
to Macon, so he said. His contract

and walk to Macon in 14 months

must not ride, beg or steal.

Atlanta, Dec. 4.?An unidentified
man about twenty-five years old saturated
his clothing with oil and rushed
out of an alley into West Peachtree

a match as he ran. A moment later
he dashed headlong into a street car.
He was burned to death before passengers
on the car could extinguish

Notes From Carlisle School.
The first big reception of the year
on last Wednesday evening was a
very beautiful affair. The lobby of
Guilds hall was very beautifully decorated
by many various kinds of
flowers and Dot plants especially ar
ranged for the occasion. Over a hundred
young men and ladies were
present. At a late hour an ice course
was served. A big time was in store
for all and those present enjoyed it
thoroughly.
Thanksgiving day was a holiday.
All restrictions were waived and the
students were allowed to spend the
time as they pleased. Many of the
young men found the girls' hall a
very attractive resort on this day.
However, pleasure cannot last always
and Friday morning found the
students in class determined to do
better work than ever before.
Headmaster J. C. Guilds attended
the annual conference of the Methodist
church in Florence last week.

Discussion as to the possible ineligibility

of the requirement of residence

awkward and unnecessary "he or

of the inclusive "he." Virginia's
penal statutes, for example, prescribe
that if "any persons" do almost
any sort of thing, "he" shall be
punished in such and such a manner.
And no woman ever escaped punishment
because of that "he." So, a

DEAD BABY FOUND IN CREEK.
Body Covered in Lime and Wrapped
in Cloth.
Spartanburg, Dec. 1.?The body of
a baby was found today in Fair Forrest
creek, just outside the city, by
W. M. Williams, a white man, who
lives in the suburbs of the city. The
baby was wrapped in three black
cloths and the inside cloth was covered
with lime, which had caused the
body to be in such decomposed condition
it has been impossible to determine
whether the baby was white
or colored. Mr. Williams passed by
the place where he found the body
earlier in the day and he says it was
not there then, but when he passed

This is the second deed of this kind
that has occurred in this county, this

Appalachia mill pond, near Greer.
Police are working upon both these

PRESERVING COTTON SEED.
Cleaning Machinery and Community
Culture of Single Type Advisable.
?
* In order that the puyity of his
cotton seed may be preserved for
planting, the farmer patronizing the
ordinary custom gin should see to it
that all seed are carefully cleaned
from the machinery, transportation
channels and receptacles before operations
are begun on his seed cotton,
says at recent publication of the United
States department of agriculture,
Farmers' Bulletin 764, "Cotton Ginning
Information for Farmers." Under
ordinary practice a small amount
of seed from the bale last ginned is
left in the "seed roll," which fills a
portion of machinery, and this is
passed on with the seed of the next
bale, seed from the latter bale being
left in turn.
Often the ginner will be so busy
on an ordinary day that it will be
impossible for . him to spare the time
necessary to clean the gin properly.
It may be well, therefore, for the
farmer to save the cotton from which
he wishes to Reserve the seed until
near the close of the ginning season
when the pressure of business on the
gin is not so great. It must be kept
in mind by the farmer striving to
improve the type of his cotton
through seed selection that he can
not be assured of getting even relatively
pure seed from the gin without
the cooperation of the ginner.
Since there are so many opportunities
for seed passing through gins
in general use to become mixed with
seed of inferior quality, it is pointed
out that the most effective plan for
preserving the purity of seed is for
each community to determine by ex- *
periment the particular variety of
cotton which is best suited to its sec
tion and for the farmers to agree to
plant that variety only. x With the
present practices in ginning and the
custom of planting different varieties
indiscriminately in the same locality,
say the specialists, it is only a
question of time until all varieties no
matter how well selected, will descend
to one mongrel type.
Much the same mechanical conditions
which make the mixing of seed
from different bales a common, oe
currence in ginning bring about tne
"plating" of bales of fibre. The ginner,
in his anxiety to crowd the capacity
of his gin, frequently does not
allow a sufficient length of time for
each wagon load of seed cotton to be
ginned completely. His estimate may
be sufficiently correct, as far as the
actual amount of cotton concerned,
but there is a possibility that each
bale will get a few pounds of lint
from the preceding load, and in turn
will leave a like amount of cotton
for the next bale. Thus the bales
are not only plated, but as they often
are not of the same grade, the
better bale may be penalized down to
the value of the lower grade, as the
grade of a bale is usually determined
by the lower side.?Progressive Farmer.
A Reasonable Surmise.
"We have a congressman who inspires
respect everywhere he goes/'
"How does he contrive to do that?"
"As soon as it becomes known that
he has a private fortune of about
$15,000, people can't imagine any
other reason for his want!." " hold
down a job that pays only ,$7 jO a
year, so they concluded that he must
