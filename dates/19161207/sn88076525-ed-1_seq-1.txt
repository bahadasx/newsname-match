the revised version of the proverb or

Patronized Clipping" Bureau.
That Frederick subscribed to a clip
ping bureau to obtain tiie names and

whose relative he victimized is alleged
by Detective Bert Carr, who arrested
the man, after trailing him for maa

To these dead persons Frederick
it is charged, shipped (cheap books fo
which he charged top-notch prices.
Letters sent, with the consignment
stated that "in response to your order,
we ship the following goods." |i

ACT 1ST mi
Washington, Dec. 9.—Corrupt prac
tice legislation, the Owen bill, to limit
expenditures by any political party for
election: of president .and vice presi-
expendituro# for election of s&atArs
and representatives, wins made today
the unfinished business of the senate.
Senator Owen, who made the motion,
said he would press the bill at every
possible opportunity until its passage.
The Oklahoma senator referred to
promises of co-operation given by Re
publican senators just before adjruon
ment last September, when a futile
effort was made to pass the bill. He
calleed upon these senators to make
good their words, declaring that "no
Republican can permit a condition to
endure which permits the highest leg
islative and executive powers of the
people to be controlled by the sordid
use of money on a large scale."
Senator Penrose introduced .as an
amendment to the Owen bill the old
"Force bill" defeated in a notable figlit
26 years ago, which would give super
vision of elections to the federal gov
ernment and prevent disfranchisement
of negroes in the southern states.

SMUGGLED LETTER TO PRESI

TIAL BRITON HINTS AT DESIRE
TO BRING WAR TO AN END.
SAYS PROPOSOL AT FIRST
WILL PROVE UNPOPULAR
Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 7.—Within
a week or ten days President Wilson
is to give to the press a copy of a re
markable letter addressed to him by
a man high in the esteem of the Brit
ish public which advises the chief ex
ecutive that England would be willing
to consider peace if the same are pre
sented by the United States. The
foregoing information .''' was made
known here today «m unimpeachable
authority.
The letter, which is lengthy, was
recently brought into this country by
an unnamed man who carried it past
the British censors by keeping it in
his boot.
The communication says that if
peace is broached to England.it will
at first be received unfavorably, but
that after time is given the British
to think it over such proposals will be
received favorably.

LANES FROM ST. PAUL TO THE

railroads are planting trees all along
their right of ways, clear to the coast.
Big" machines are used for the pur
pose,and the tree gang plants 20,000
trees a day.
The primary purpose appears to be
utility. The trees acts as a wind

north side. But the railroads also
take just pride in the fact that the
long green line replacing the unsight

What a relief it would be on any
railroad to pass hour after hour, in
the summer time, through a leafy lane
of trees, with their suggestion of cool

out of the ugly sights tiiat are typical
of the railroads in the Vuited States.
There is a gratifying tendency on the

He urged the purchase of the oll

Captain McKean appeared to ex

an aviation field at the proposed base,
he went into-the plan in some detail,
altho the navy department has not yet

The owners ask $l,4Qp,000 for the
exposition land, which includes about
640 acres, the Captain said.
Chairman Plunket remarked that
such a figure would mean a wide mar

the facilities offered for sale were
worth the price. 'J
Captain McKean said the navy had
purchased 125 aircraft since the air
