Famine in Paper
Causing Suspensions
Eight weekly aewtpnpers have
been forced to suspend publica
tioo because of the high cast of
paper. Tlie Typographical Jour
ual says that U. Thornton Libby,
who for twenty five years has
published eight country papers
at Portland, Maine, has closed
up his business.
Many other small papers are
going out- of business beqause of
the boost in the cost of paper.
Some weekly papers, including
our neighbor, tho Irvine Sun,
have increased their rates to 82 a
ypar. Many dnily papers have
increased subcription rates from
0 to 12 cents a week, and adver
tis'ing rates are advancing all
over the country. The paper
makers say that after Jan. 1st
there will be another increase in
tho cost ot print paper, and they
only promise to iili orders for a
few months ahead. The reserve
supp'y at the mills is gradually
being consumed and the situa
tiou becomes more serious every
day.
Until Jan. 1st, the Olay City
Times will nccept subscriptions
at 75 cents per year. After thar
date the price will necessarily be
one dollar.

What is a Life Term?
In a public address a few weeks
ngo Gov. Stanley arraigned the
jurios of Kentucky for the geuer
al prevalence of lawlessness.
Now read, this Frankfort tele
gram":
''Governor Stanley pardoned Bart
Uelielier, of Pike county, who be
gan a life sentence at the reform
ntory for murder last October.
Sentenced in October to a lifo
term in the penitentiary, in No.
vomber a fortunate citizen of
Pike receives a pardon from a
Governor who sought a few
weeks ago to put on an indefinite
and constantly changing jury re
spnsibility for that lawlessness
which disgraces Kentucky
The record of the Governor in
this pardon policy nulifies tho
work of the jury, and makes the
criminal classes believe that
murder is no crime iu Kentucky.
Think of a life sentence,, im
posed by a jury, becoming lim
ited by the Governor to one
month sentenced "for life" in
October; released by a pardon
in November! Louisville Post.

gathered unto dust and to judge
ment together, let us forget that
hitherto we were Republicans or
Democrats and henceforth be
friends and neighbors and com
rades, forgetting rjiyjqc ' and
strife, and the bad temper or po
litical division, and moving in
one column forward to greater
prosperity, greuter happiness,
better citizenship aud universal
peace. Lexington Herald.
