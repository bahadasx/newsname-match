HOW SAM INSULL IS
ABOUT TOJDO CHICAGO
His Two Big Stunts to Prop Up His Multi-Million Utility
Trust To Fix Up the Gas Company, Get a Per
petual Street Railway Franchise and Kill
Municipal Ownership.
BY N. D. COCHRAN
Without going into the details of
that report of the subway commis
sion, in general it looks as if the
game is to have another Unification,
pump more water'into street railway
capitalization, get a perpetual fran
chise, make the people pay '2 cents
for a transfer, wipe out the traction
55per cent fund and' make municipal
ownership impossible by making it
Jmjpractljablf.
Making the proposed new grant
run until terminated by public own
ership is equivalent to a perpetual
franchise, because the price is to be
piled up so high that even Chicago
will never be able to get the money
to buy.
After voting three times for mu
nicipal ownership the people were
trapped into putting it off until 1927
by the unifying ordinances of 1907.
