BLACKFOOT FOOTBALL CHAMPS.
For a number of years past Blackfoot
has put out a football teani that has
attracted attention throughout the in
termountain country. This year the
team is stronger than usual. The com
petion has been keener than ever before
but the 1916 representatives have
made a clean record.
The early games were woli by small
scores but as Coach Dice Juolded his
material into smooth working machinery
the scores mounted to figured that show
the great strength of the iiliished pro
duct. American Falls, a team of prac
tically the same weight, was defeated
by the score of 1(11 Jo 0 and the strong
Idaho Tech second team went down to
defeat by the score of 41 to 10.
It is a keen disappointment to the
followers of the team that fione of the
western claimants for honors would ac
cept a Thanksgiving day game with
Blackfoot. Both Caldwell and Weiser
refused to play either in Blackfoot or
on their own gridiron on Thanksgiving
day. Jim Martin - , a local enthusiast,
went out and raised $400 in a couple
of hours to defray the expenses of a vis
iting team for turkey day.
The Blackfoot team is a well balan
ced machine. The weight is well dis
tributed aud the spepd is evidenced by
every move of the team. Captain Lois
Stephens is the only really large man on
the squad, and he carries his 225
pounds with a speed and precision that
has torn up opposing lines from end to
end.
The challenges issued to all teams
in southern Idaho in the high school
class having been passed op, Blackfoot
ends her season with a .just claim to
the state championship. T|ie faculty of
the high school and business men of the
town will fender the team a ban
quet and reception on Tuesday night
and a never defeated team will become
a matter of southern Idaho history.
IMPORTANT NOTICE

City Negotiating for
Municipal Water Plant
The city council held a meeting Tues
day night with all members present
but DeKav and Pelkey.
Mayor Peck was present and called
the meeting toorder when the minu
tes of the previous meeting were read
and approved.
The improvement committee, who were
requested to investigate the condition of
the Blnckfoot water works with a view
of fhe city taking over the same, re
ported that the price asked was $82,
000. The net receipts of the plant for
1915 was $13,469.15, which Mr. Hil
liard, the manager, said had increased
10 per cent this year. Mr. Hilliard
also stated that a Seattle firm had an
option on the property for the same
price that it is offered to the city, but
that Mr. Johnson would prefer selling
it to the city as the plant hand an an
nual revenue of $,'OOo.UO. Mayor Peck
and several coiiucilmen spoke very ap
provingly of the eitv securing the-pinnt
before any outside people got a hold
on it, as the city needed its own wat
er works and sooner or later would
have one, and that the city never again
would get such an enticing proposi
tion for a municipal plant. It is esti
mated that with the completion of the
present recent improvements and a few
thousand dollars, ithe city could have
a water plant that would not only be
adequate, but be a money-making in
vestment for the city. The matter
was referred to the same committee
and the city engineer for further in
vestigation.
The proposition of raising the prices
of lots in the ' ' city of the dead ' ' was
discussed, aud will probably be ad
vanced. The matter was referred to
the mayor for adjustment, who will
also determine what a lot and its perpet
ual maintenance is worth.
BANKER FARMER'S FIRST BORN.
Last Sunday afternoon Mark Farmer,
the popular banker, became the father
of a bouncing baby boy. It was the
first born and a husky, lively seven
pounder, who was the cause of his
father blowing himself for a box of
fragrant smokes, which were distributed
among the happy dad's many friends
and well-wishers.
The young Farmer and his mother
are doing well, and Mark is rejoicing
over his early Christmas present.
.Bingham Bourbons Endorsed.
The Democratic county central com
mittee held a meeting last night and
among other business transacted was

son of man 's inhumanity to man, one
that cannot fail but to convince one
that man is the most brutal of God 's
creations.

ANOTHER VICTIM
Last Saturday morning about 11
o'clock, Mrs. Emil Sundquist of Firth
was badly burned at her home in Firth.
The accident was caused by the un
fortunate woman throwing coil oil into
the stove, whose fire was not warm
enough for her, and caused the stove
to explode and the burning oil to en
velop hor face, neck and hands. The
skin on her lower limbs was also
badly scorched. When the flames
caught her she ran out of the house
screaming for help and threw herself
in tho snow, and when neighbors ar
rived they helped her smother the
flames of hor clothing and took her
into the house and sent for medical aid.
At last, accounts she was resting easy
as could be expected.

SIBYL SAMMIS MacDERMID
Dramatic Soprano
What may be accomplished by the
gfit and determination of the Ameri
can girl when she really sets herself
a goal to win, is strikingly illustrated
in the career of Sibyl Sammis-MaeDei
mid. Reared on a Dakota ranch with
limited opportunities for music or study
excepting those offered at Pierre, Miss
Santmis was sent to Chicago by a rela
tive who offert d to give her an edu
cation. She proved a keen and earnest
student and before she was out of her
teens, she accepted an engagement and
toured the country from const to const
ns soloist with the Chicago Marino band.
Her ambition and keen desire to fit
herself for a career took her to Paris
mul Mme. Lurig, a retired assistant of
Marchesi, becoming interested in the
possibilities of the young soprano, dl
roeted ! er studies, and to such brilliant
achievement did the young artist work
that upon her return to New ^tork, she
filled a triumphant engagement at Mud
e on Square Carden ns Wagnerian so
loist with the Metropolian Opera house
orchestra. Then followed a tour with
the itinerary covering practically tho
entire «-oiuitry.
Another year was spent, in London,
where she was coached with Kir Henry
Wood and appeared under his direc
tion with the Queen's Hall orchestra,
besides filling important engagements
in the provinces. Since her return to
America, Mme. Sainmis-MacDermid has
established herself as an artist of first
rank, filling her share of desirable
engagements, including appearances
with the New Yok, Chicago, Minne
apolis and St. Paul Symphony orches
tras ns well as with the important choral
bodies.
