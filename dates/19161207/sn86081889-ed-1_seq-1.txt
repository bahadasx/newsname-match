Walter Gress Lost Eye.
Two weeks ago, the News
told of a shell exploding and in
juring one of Walter Cress's eyes.
Walter is 15 years of age and a
son of Mrs. Rhoda Gress, of the
Cove. On the 20th of Novem
ber, Walter was in the act of
firing a gun at an old tin bucket
He noticed when he put the shell
into the gun, that the shell was
rather tight and so it was, for
when he pulled the trigger, a
piece of the rim of the shell flew
back and hit him in the right
eye. In the hope that the sight
might be saved, he was taken to
the hospital in Chambersburg,
but after careful consideration,
it was deemed best to remove
the eye. This was done last
Saturday afternoon. His mother
and his sister Bessie, (Mrs. Geo.
Richards), went to Chambers
burg Saturday and remained un
til Sunday. While in Chambers
burg, they were guests in the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey
Horst.
Walter is getting along first
rate now and will be home in a

work of the institute is going on
as smoothly as a new eight-day

Of course, it is out of the
question to print all the good
things the speakers say, but the
hints and suggestions given will
be taken back to the school room
next week, and the thousands of
Fulton County boys and girls in
our public schools will gradually
absorb the instruction given this
week at the institute and the
standard of popular education be
elevated to a higher plane.

Harrisburg, Dec. 2: Charles
M. Schwab's plans for the de
velopment of his Bethlehem Steel
propertied will not only mean
much to the development of this
city and Steelton, through the
building up of the Steelton plant
but may make Harrisburg the
central point between Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia on the old South
Penn railroad.
Railroad men who have been
following the negotiations . be
tween the Pennsylvania railroad,
which Is interested in getting the
home Bethlehem plant on its
system, and the Lehigh Coal and
Navigation company, which owns
the Lehigh and New England
railroad, see in the move one to
revive the South Penn.
As far as the negotiations have
progressed the contemplated
plan of the two transportation
companies is to run a line start
injr at Dauphin or Duneannnn,
which latter pl tn would necessit
ate the b'rilning of a new railroad
bridge across the Susquehanna
river, through the Lykens valley
to Schuylkill county and then to
a point near Tamaqua, where it
would join the Lehigh and New
England railroad. This plan
contemplates the purchase of a
half-interest or a bare majority
of the latter railroad's stock.
This line passes through Pough
keepsie and thence over the New
Haven system.
Letter From Harry Bocrner.
While Harry Boerner has been
away from McConnellsburg more
than a score and a half of years,
he is well remembered by many
McConnellsburg people who were
his schoolmates during his boy
hood days. Harry has been a
shut-in for a long time, suffering
greatly with rheumatism and
kindred ailments. Under date of
November 29th, Harry writes
from his home in Shannon, 111.,
as follows: "Enclosed I am send
ing a dollar for another year's
subscription to the News. We
would not want to think of trying
to get along without hearing reg
ularly from our old home. We
have had a fine fall out here
but very few days of cold weath
er. To-day is just like spring.
Mother's.health is just about as
usual. She is still able to do her
own work even to the family
washing besides taking care of
me. I had a very hard time of
it for eight weeks this summer,
during which time I was not able
to be out of bed, and I surely did
some suffering. But now I am
feeling better than for a long
time have a good color, and
mother says I am getting fat.
She says if I keep on, I will have
a double chin like she has. I am
still under the doctor's care. He
says he likes chronic cases, and
he is doing some experimenting
on me. Among other ailments
I have loco-motor ataxia. I am
willing for him to see what he
can do, for he is not likely to do
me any harm, even if he does me
no good. I think my legs are
beginning to get stronger, The
doctor injects the medicine into
my hips twice a day.
Living is high here: apples
$4.50 a barrel: potatoes, 55 cents
a peck, and very scarce at that
I would like to be back in Mc
Connellsburg when the railroad
is completed, and ride in on the
first train. I shall be pleased at
any time to get a letter from any
of my old schoolmates and my
friends.

Boss Left For Parts Unknown, Sheriff
Garland Temporarily Superin
tendent. On the quiet, the News wishes
to say to any of our distant Ful
ton County friends that may be
delaying a visit to McConnells
burg, "Don't wait to come in on
our new railroad, but come to
Chambersburg and inquire for
Sheets's or Murray's autobus."
Our raifroad ha3 just had a relapse
and its condition now is awaken
ing the gravest apprehension.
In the fall of 1914 two gentle
men by the name of Post and
Shearer came into this commun
ity and organized a company to
build an electric road between
McConnellsburgand Fort Loudon.
The contract was let to Bennett
and Smith, of Greenaburg, prac
tical railroad builders, who spent
the summer of 1915 working on
the Fort Loudon side of the
mountain. For lack of funds,
the work closed down at the
opening of winter one year ago.
Last spring, Clyde E. Coon, of
New York, appeared on the scene
organized a new company, chang
ing from an electric, to a steam
road. Contracts fcr the con
s:urction were let, work began,
and it was carried on vigorously
until about ten days ago, when
the men refused to work longer
without getting their ray. Coon
who had gone to New York to
get money did not return, and
legal proceedings were instituted
to attach his property and as far
as possible secure the laborers
and others who had claims.
But, there is another chapter.
Monday, the Lemaster Nation
al Bank, at Lemasters, Franklin
county closed its doors, and it
was found that Coon had suc
ceeded in buncoing the cashier,
Mr. Enos Myers, out of more
than $50,000.00. This Coon did
by placing in the hands of the
Cashier a supposed "draft" on a
New York institution and draw
ing funds from the Lemaster
bank on the credit of that draft.
Later Coon succeeded in getting
the "draft" from the cashier,
and now both Coon and the draft
are not in sight
Coon tried to work the banks
in this county, but our banks are
not "easy."
All Coon's effects consisting of
mules, machinery, etc, are in the
hands of the Sheriff.
Subcontractor McLean, who
used several thousand dollars of
his private funds to pay his men,
is a heavy loser.
It is unfortunate that after
having done so much work on
the construction of the road that
it should come to such an abrupt
termination. The News has
deen criticised for not giving
more railroad news, but we have
always felt that the best news
would be the announcement when
the road was completed.
FVom Clara Powt.ll Riggin.
Barr, Mont., Dec. 2, 1916.
Dear Editor: I was gratified
recently to see in your paper a
report of what was accomplished
by the women voters in Utah at
the late election.
As women are allowed to vote
in this state (Montana) the re
port was especially interesting te
me. We, of Montana, feel proud
of our Btate in this fall's election;
for our state has' gone "dry" by
a vote of nearly 2 to 1. We suc
ceeded in electing to nearly all
our offices men who stand for
prohibition, and we also, had a
direct vote on the sale and manu
facture of intoxicating liquors.
In but one town in the entire
state, did the "wets" get a ma
jority. Montana will 'go down in his
tory as being the first to send a
a woman to Congress. This we
did in the person of Miss Jean
nette Rankin.
I hope the good people of my
native state, dear old Pennsylva
nia, will put their shoulders to
the wheel and help to add the
Keystone state to the other nine
teen states of the Union that
have put John Barleycorn out of
business,
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene ly
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. P., .
Commissioner of Health.
Forty is an unlucky number
for men five feet eight or under
if it is the waist measure. Any
number above that is equally to
be avoided. Over weight is dan
gerous and is indicative of several
things. Either the appetite is
not controlled, insufficient ex
ercise is taken or the diet is made
up of improperly selected food
stuffs.
If any or all of these things
are to blame it is the part of
wisdom to seek expert advice and
begin the remedy forthwith. To
sink into the placid indifference
of the fat and forty stage is a
crime against your health. It
means in all probability that the
liver and kidneys are overwork
ed and the results of any such
strain prolonged is at times fatal.
There is another reason which
is worth almost equal considera
tion. To over-feed undermines
one's health. Physical fitnes3
has a distinct bearing on a man's
mental attitude and unfitness has
also. The man who, through ne
glect and lack of control over his
appetite, begins to eat himself
into an early grave, loses his
crispness of thought The self
respect which every man who
achieves things should have for
himself as a clean well groomed
animal, is lacking.
Don't weakly excuse yourself
if you have unconsciously slipped
into this class. Get busy and
work yourself out of it before it
3 too late.
Advantage of Fall Plowing.
"Fall plowing is a practice that
leads to the destruction of the
larva of the click beetle, known
as the wireworm, the white grub
the larva of the June bug and
the cutworm, the larva of a night
flying miller or moth well known
by its fluttering about lights dur
ing summer nights," says Frank
lin Menges, soil expert of the
Pennsylvania Department of Ag
riculture. "The reason why fall plowing
is usually so destructive of these
larvae is that they construct an
encisting among the roots of the
plants upon which they feed at
this season of the year, or per
haps a little earlier in the south
ern section of this State, and sev
eral weeks earlier in the north
ern areas, in which they pass the
winter.
"Any farmer who would pre
fer spring plowing but fears that
his land might be infected with
any or all of these larvae can find
out by spending a little t time in
examining the sod field which is
to be planted with corn the next
spring and if any or all of these
larvae, the six legged yellowish
or brown wireworm or the white
grub recognized by every one
and the greenish greasy lookirg
cutworm, are there it would be
advisable to fall plow such a sod.
and set it on edge so as to break
up and expose the encisting and
in this way destroy hundreds of
these enemies of the corn crop.
"During the soil investigations
this fall quite a number of sod
fields, the soil of which should
not be fall plowed, because they
are loams and gravels but be
cause of the presence' of these
larva, fall plowing of these fields
are suggested."
