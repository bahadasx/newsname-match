Citizens of County Use
SO Cents Liquor Each
Records at ihe couniy auditor's
office show that Whatcom county
13 spending; not more than 50 cents
per head per year for Intoxicating
liquors, including alcohol. Before
the state-wide prohibition law be
catna effective and when Balling-j
hem had forty-three saloons the an
nual per capita expenditure for li
quors of this nature in the county
exceeded $5 hy a big margin, It la
conservatively estimated that at
that time these saloons paid out
not less than $365,000 per year for
liquor stocks, rant, licenses, labor
■ed miscellaneous expenses, all Of
which, together with the profits
made on the liquor, the community
bad to pay.
Undeniably, according to the au
ditor's records, Whatcom county is
the lowest, of the state's principal
counties in point of expenditure :'or
intoxicating liquors, and Deputy S.
0. Barrett who has kept 1 is eye on
the matter, says that it is one of
he lowest counties In tho entire
date. If not the lowest, in this re
,pect. Compared with the number
>i permits issued IB some of tbe
Itber counties, Whatcom county's 11-
--pior purchases seem very small,
rung county, for example, l-sued
iboul 30,000 permits in Novembei
•nd the number issued In Snohomish
:ounty, with a population about the
same as Whatcom county, is three
imes greater at this time of Mm
year.

Physical Training of Children Necessary to
Their Mental Development
By WILLIAM G. WILLCOX. President of the Board of Education.
New York City
THERE can be no difference of opinion ns to the importance of more
thorough and systematic physical training for our schoolboys—
' training loss confined to a few star ntliletic .performers who are in
least need of it nnd promoting throughout the entire school system the
development of SOUND, VIOOBOUS BODIES, WITHOUT WHICH
INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENTS ARE OE LITTLE VALUE.
Such training as is given to the boy scouts promotes not only physical
developmei t, but mental development and character development, which
are imperatively needed not only ns a preliminary preparation for mili
tary service and natural defense if occasion should arise, but also and
especially a* preparation for efficient citizenship in time of pence.
EUROPI AN EXPERIENCE AND EXPERT MILITARY OPINION CLEAR
LV INDICATE THAT THE BIG PROBLEM IN PREPARATION FOR EFFEC
TIVE MILT'AftY SERVICE IS NOT TRAINING IN MILITARY TACTICS OR
DRILL, BIT GETTING MEN INTO FIT PHYSICAL CONDITION.
Here is a program upon which pacifist and militarist can co-operate.
The new mail schedule comraeuc
ing Dec. 16th, will be as follows:
Mail arrives at 8 a. m. and 4 p.
rr. dal'y except Sunday.

18. daily except. Sun.day.
T' c rural carriers will wait for
the morning mail, leaving the of
fice at 9 a. m.
T'e postoffiee under the new
3( hedule will be open on Sunday
morning from 8:30 to 9:30 on'y.
