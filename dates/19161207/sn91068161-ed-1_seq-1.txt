ntltuias(ic Meeting Board of Trade
Held Tuesday Sight Secretary
Talk MembersMp Rates
Changed.
A very
enthusiastic and well at
tended mooting of the Hendersonville
Board oi Trade was held at the city
hall Tae.ay nigm. v arious topics were
diseiisod
and some changes were
made in the rates to be paid by the
different classes of memoersnip.
The numbers listened to an address
t,v c. 1". Robertson, of Leaksville,
X (. who sopke with refer,
ence to establishing a fair asso
ciation in this city, the idea being to
hold a fair here next fall and to ues
tiie grounds for various kinds of
amusements. A committee was ap
pointed to meet and confer further
with Mr. Robertson with the hope that
something definite might be accom
plished.
Following a short address by Dr. L.
-B. Morse a committee was appointed
to co-operate with the Doctor in an ef
fort to have the magnificent Mt. He
i bron-Jump Off Scenic highway com
pleted in time for it to be used by the
summer tourists next summer.
Membership Rates.
The board voted in favor of slightly
changing the different classes of mem
bership." the new 'rates being $5, $10
and $l per annum to be collected
quarterly in advance.
A very strong talk was made by E.
W. Ewbank to the effect that in the
past 'a few good men have been wear
ins the harness and drawing the load,
and the majority seemed only anxious
to jump on and ride." Various sug
gestions were made and steps will be
taken to see if every merchant nni
every citizen rannot be made to re
alize his duties and responsibilities in
the upbuilding and welfare of Hender
sonville. Cotton Mills.
The necessity and possibility of In
ducing cotton mills to come to Heu
dersonville ..was discussed by C. P.
Bland and E. W. Ewbank. It was
brought out that statements have been
made by prominent men in this state
in recent interviews indicating their
desire to establish cotton mills in and
near Hendersonville.
Golf Course Discussed.
There was much dissussion regard
ing the feasibility and advantages of
opening a golf course in Henderson
ville. Attention was called to the fact
that investment in land for this pur
pose was not a. wild cat scheme and
in no way a subscription or donation.
Today in "town one man may buy five
acres of land purely as an investment
and hold for five years, another man
dos the 5ume with 50 acres, and still
another man with 100 acres. Perhaps
at the end of five years they have done
nothing towards improving or in
creasing the value of their holdings.
How much Letter would it for for
these three men to combine and buy
the property in one tract and open up
a golf course If they gave the use of
this land free of all charge, as a result
of the improvements that would have
to be made, this land would be bound
to have increased in value five times
as much as the individual holdings
that were not improved.
Statement by Secretary.
In an interview with A. S. Truex,
acting secretary and treasurer of the
Board of Trade. Mr. Truex said:
"The Board of Trade and the city
of Hendersonville are one and the
same. The Board of Trade was not
et.blished cand 'Will not be conducted
for the purpose of individual ain -or
profit to any one man or party. Hen
dersonville needs the support of every
citizen, especially the support of every
merchant and business man, but no
more so than the merchant or business
man needs the support of Henderson
ville. "We are determined to let the citi
zens know just who the men are who
come in this Board of Trade and work
for the good of the town. Those of us
who are not broad-minded enough or
are too selfish to come into our organ
ization will som be known. It should
te obvious that the Board of Trade
Properly conducted cannot be expect
ed to directly benefit anyone, but will
indirectly be a benefit to all. The belt
arid the widest publicity will be given
as to the names of th members of the
Board of Trade." - .

MRSI lllLtER AViLL KELP
LEFT WITH HER
Had Numerous Requests for Child
From People IVho Were Willing
- :fc'o Give It a Home.
Mrs. W. L. Miller has asked the
Hustler to" state for her that she has
decided to1 keep the bright baby boy
left with V her in Williams' store here
Saturday a week ago by a young wo
man supposed to be the child's mother.
" She hag-jbecome very much attached
to the youngster and has never en
tertained "any thought of giving him
up. She intends to keep- him and raisi
him up to; manhood in her own kind,
motherly way. Since the story haj
been published telling of Mrs.. Miller's
strange acquisition of the baby, whose
name according to a note left with
him. is "Alfred Lee Ray, she has been
flooded-.with inquiries and requestn
for the child. One lady in the eastern
part of this State requested 'that the
child he bundled up and sent to her
in care of the train conductor, whilo
another lady living In South Carolina,
being more considerate of the child,
stated that if Mrs. Miller was willing
to give the child up she would com
after him personally.
So it is that the baby has found a
home - and .' a ;good home at that. Tho
woman --."t supposed to be the child's
mother chose wisely and it is good for
all concerned that Mrs. Miller is to bc
the one.to raise him up to manhood."
Another chapter of life full of hu
man interest has been written and the
Hustler knows, that whatever may
have been the motive the mother had
for abandoning the child, she left it iu
good care, and hopes that if she has
done wron In the past, this episode in
her life may be the means of her doinr
good hereafter.
Congress opened for the short ses
sion Monday.

PROGRESSING
ON BAT CAVE BRIDGE
Completion of Structure Will be Wei.
corned by Hendersonville Mer
chants Wooden Construction.
Henderson county will be the first
county to finish a complete good road
into the Bat Cave Chimney Rock sec
tion since the flood When the new
bridge over Rocky Broad river is com-
men is busily engaged In building
' granite abutments and a wooden
! bridge which it Is said will be covered
, with a roof to protect the suspensions
from the weather. The high cost of
I steel is causing the county authorities
to Duiid wooden bridges over Green
river and French Broad river where
ever the flood washed away a steel
bridge. '
The completion of the Bat Cave
bridge will be welcomed by the local
merchants who are planning to fur
nish the trade of this section for
Christmas.
It is said that one automobile has
succeeded, in reaching Bat Cave from
Asheville over the state highway and
it is known that the Asheville business
men are urging the completion of that
route. Hendersonville was the only
outlet of this country for several
months after the. flood. The citizens
of that section have grown accustom
ed to trading In Hendersonville and
no doubt wil continue to make thia
their trading center.
THE COLORED RURAL SCHOOL.
One of .the most progressive com
munities in the State is Flat1 Rock.
It is three miles ""east, of Henderson
ville on. the Southern Railway oh the
very summit of the "Blue Ridge." -Our.
peoiile.MA'thts ;fcommunUy are
above the average in" intelligenceva,nd
moral worth. They are self-respecting,
r law abiding people. There ar-3
thirty-six families of color in Flat
Rock,: all own homes that would do
credit to any community. Many of
these homes are homes of culture and
refinement. As an evidence of the
progressive spirit of the colored ueo.
ple of Flat Rock I submit the follow
ing statistics : Last year these people
raised 5,000 pounds of meat, 662 bsh
els of corn, 300 bushels of potatoes,
6.000 cans of fruits and vegetables.
The. canning establishment is owned
; by H. S, Simmons. Our people in thfc
immediate section own 455 acres of
land. They are very much interested
in education, and are friendly towards
every good cause.
The public school has been in Ses
sion but a few weeks. In that time
we have raised enough money to pur
chase a library, shades and curtain?
for the rooms. We had 36 articles on
exhibition at the colored fair at Ashe
viTTe last week all of which were hand
made. None:pf the exhibits surpassed
those of our girls club of which Miss
Bettie Darity is president. The
j schools of Henderson County carried
off the honors.
The public school is in charge of the
writer, assisted by Miss Ophelia.

IFTEEN
Work of Draining Mud Creek Bot
toms Expected fo Begin at
an Early Date.
The work of draining Mud Creek
valley will within all probability be
gin shortly as the necessary $15,000
worth of bonds have been sold at par
and the money is expected any day.
It is generally understood that Z. Z.
Blythe has been awarded the contract
for the dredging work and he is ready
to give bond for the faithful perform
ance of his duty.
The preliminary steps for this drain
age were taken two years ago when a
bill was-passed by the legislature per- -mitting
bonds to be Issued by the pro-
perty owners along the valley of !Mud
Creek for this purpose. Out of the
fifty-four property owners in tiie dis
trict all but two of them signed the
petition for the extra tax. Major
Barker, who owns over one half of the
drainage and will necessarily have to
pay over one half of the costs Is en
thusiastic over the work. The lower
ing of the bed of the creek will greatly
enhance the valueN of his- lands, alone
with the others.
The uncertain condition of the creek
during flood times, or even after hard
rains has xfor many years been a
source of annoyance and also damage ,
to those living near same. This hast
kept Mud creek bottoms from produc
ing good crops every year and has.
caused a vast area of valuable agri
cultural land to, be practicaly worth
less. Hundreds 'of acres of this valley
are within the city limits of Hender
sonville. When the property is well drained. ,
the creek bed lowered to its proper
depth and dikes built as a further pre
yentitive of th creek ever flooding out-
pf its banks, it Is predicted that East
and South Hendersonville will be de
veloped into beautiful residential sec
tions. -
Over in the Barker lands, within" the
city limits, across the creek, are valuable-building
sites.; The Flat Rocs:
"drive is "now being greatly -Improved C
by-the city authorities. A water line
of a permanent kind, and a sewerage
system are being installed.
Of course the greatest benefit to be
derived from the drainage is the re
claiming of fifteen hundred acres" off
the most valuable farming land In the
county. This land Is composed of very
rich" soil and when free from floods'
will be made to jroduce enough corn?
to supply Hendersonville; it is said.
Arrangements have been made withv
the county commissioners and town
ship supervisors to use the mammoth
dredging machine owned by the . coun
ty. This machine was purchased sev
eral years ago at a cost of about $5,000
and has- been extensively used In se
curing sand for the newly graded
roads. The county will continue to
use the sand from the creek and will
simply loan the machine to the drain
age commission.
A great Tleal of the credit of securing
this reclaiming project should be
given W. C. Jordan, one of the land
owners, in the districtHe has given
much of his time and energy to pro
moting the scheme and his untiring
efforts have resulted in selling the
bonds at par., it took several months,
says Mr. Jordan, to land the sale of the
bonds. There were offers from a num
ber of bonding concerns for less than
par but Mr. Jordan was persistent in
his efforts and soon located the right ;
concern. 1 .
Mr. Jordan thinks that the "drainage
will be one of the greatest assets of
the county and In time will be felt by
the entire county as a great lift In the -resources
of the community.
