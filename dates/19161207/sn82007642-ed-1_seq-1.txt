of their splendid leader, Mrs. Em- ference, who sends to The Obsrv-
ma Moore, gave a most enjoya-
able entertainment in the Bap-
tist church at 7:30 Thaaksgiv-
ing evening, it being given for
the benefit of the Thomasville
Orphanage. The little band of
workers for the fatherless ones
certainly performed their respec-
tive parts in a manner most
pleasing, showing that the ef-
fortg of Moonj iu putting
them to bad not been,
bvanv means, in vain, as thev
came tully up to theexpectations
of the most exacting. Miss An-
ni TVinchertv. a member of the
raud," presided at the organ,
and the entire program was in-
terspersed with violin music dis
pensed by Master James Moore.
No admission was charged but
at the close of the exercises a col
lection was taken which amouu
ted to 39.99. All parties con-
cerned are to be congratulated
upon the splendid success of the
praise-worthy undertaking.

is no leader. This, remarks an ex

, The press agent of the South-
er an occasional letter from rsew
Orleans, sprinkles the diannnd
dust on her latest effusion in
which she lauds the western men
for their appreciation of the
rights and liberties of the women.
She finds that out of the sittings
of the stream of National elec
tional election results some gold
en flakes of wisdom glitter, "lbe
ra08t brilliant one is that the
Western women are on the politi
cal summit, she says. "ve all
know how Eastern and Southern
sections have elevated women to
imDractical oedestals. The ma
jority of women do not know
this bnt the majority of men are
dead sure of thisaltitudinouspo
3ition of womanhood. This emi
nence accounts for a number of
facts. Why pay envelopes do not
reach the elevated lady she is
perched too high for access! w by
she is working longer hours per
day than men it is too fatigu-
ing to step down from the height

going to make, some men laugh;
it may make others feel uncom
fortable, and it is sure to make
some of the legislators mad. The

Editor Democrat: I desire
through tbe columns of your pa
per to express to the Democrats,
and all others of Watauga coun
ty, my deep and profound thanks
for .the splendid vote of confi
dence given me in the recent elec
tion. My increased majority over
two years ago is sufficient an
swer by t he people of the district
to the vile, dirty campaign of
misrepresentation conducted a-
gainst, me. I am also deeply
thankful for the very valuable
services rendered by your paper
in this contest.
Yours very respectfully,
R. L. DOUGHTON.

Mr. A. E. Moretz, late of Wa
tauga, but now of Cavendish,
Idaho, in remitting for his paper
writes as if he was prospeing all
right, and we are taking one par
agraph from bis interesting let
ter: "We have been unusually busy
this fall, harvesting and market
ing our crops. We had 80 acres
in beans this year, and that
meant work and lots of it, but 1
am glad to Bay we made good
on the crop. We raised a little
more thau 74,000 pounds ot
beans. After paying our rent we
had nearrly 63,000 pounds left,
which we sold at from 5 to 8 cts.
wr pound. Then we raised a good
crop of oats.
We appreciate The Democrat

Editor Democrat: 1 notice in
ast week's issue of your paper
you say, "Unless you write us
the news, etc., we cannot publish
it." So will write you a check for
another year subscription, as
this might interest you more
than anything else I could write.
I live in Avery county and will
say that it is noted for roads and
toll-gate building. And, it seems,
they build more toll-gates than
thev do roads. Two or time
were torn away near Newland
and two have been blown away
with dynamite just a short time
back, three miles from Beech
Creek on the turnpike. There were
eleven window glass jarred out
of Dave Hees's house when the
ast one was blown up. I see Wa
