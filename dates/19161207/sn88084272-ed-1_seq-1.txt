EUNSMUGSLEHSi
Attorney General Would
Prevent False Labeling of
Packages Holding Anns.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 7. Attorney
general Gregory, in his annual report to
congress, made public Wednesday, says
that despite the government's victory
in the supreme court in the Lackawan
na Coal company case, the railroads
are still able to claim that the com
modities clause does not prohibit them
from engaging in production along
their lines, provided only that they sell
the articles produced before transport
ing them. He urges an amendment to
prohibit a railroad from transporting
articles manufactured or produced by
it or by any corporation it controls.
An amendment to the criminal code
to prohibit the false labeling of pack
ages which contain arms and ammuni
tion are among other recommenda
tions. The last is to meet evasions of
the embargo on arms to Mexico.
Prosecution of Mononolleiu
The present administration, the at
torney general says, has insisted upon
more effective dissolutions of monopo
lies and combinations in restraint of
trade and at the same time "has been
solicitous to avoid prosecutions for
which there Is no adequate ground."
During the year ten of these cases have
been finally determined, and of 36
cases now pending. 15, including the
Heading. Lehigh Valley, Harvester.
SteeL Kodak, and shoe machinery
cases, have reached the supreme court.
Of those disposed of. one was the case

War At A Glance
THE brief dispatches in which
the fall of Bucharest was an
nounced left in doubt the fate
of the armies which were resisting
the advance of the Teutonic in
vaders. It is assumed In most entente
quarters, however, that there was
no "last stand" by the Rumanians
before their capital and such news
as has tricked through from Ger
man sources indicates that Bucha
rest was virtually deserted when
the Teutonic forces entered it. The
city is said to have been found un
injured. Mere Rear Guard Action
Military commentators in entente
capitals point to the probability
that the actions just prior to the'
capture of Bucharest were fought
merely with a view to delaying the
advance of field marshal von Mac
kensen's forces and aiding in the
escape of the ma.n body of Ru
manians. The capture of Ploechti, the rail
way junction. 36 miles north of
Bucharest, however, may have
blocked the retreat of a part of the
Rumanian forces. This city, more
over is in the center of the great
Parahova valley oil district.
German opinion is expressed to
the effect that the Rumanians have
decided to abandon all of Walla
chia. the main portion of the Ru
manian kingdom, and retire to Mol
davia, their northeastern province,
where the front would be material
ly shortened and where they would
be in close touch with the Rus
sians. The total captures of Rumanians
by the forces of the central powers
since the beginning of the war are
reported to have been 100.000 men.

'No Military Significance.-
London. Eng.. Dec. 7. "The fall of
Bucharest is without military signifi
cance, but I have no desire to underrate
the fact that its surrender has a con
siderable moral and political effect."
said Gen. F. B. Maurice, chief director
of military operations, at the British
wi- office on disr-ussing with the As
sociated Press today the latest military
operations of the entente allies.
The comment of the anti-government
press on the capture of Bucharest is
extremely bitter. It is declared that
the fall of the Rumanian capital will j
cause a Keen sense ot gnex and sname
to every Englishman and that it is due
to the colossal blunders of lord Grey's
diplomacy.
It is conceded that the event will be
a blow to the prestige of the allies.
The view is expressed that it will prob
ably cause a prolongation of the war.
The Mr II assumes that the wheat the
Germans claim to have captured is that
which Great Britain bought for 10,000.

became of the money.
