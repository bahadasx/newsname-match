The Christian ehurch, f IJiek-

rom this c mi'lagration ignited
inl ciiiiM'il the ilfstru-tin of the

The ehureh sustaiujj a los of
something ilke -.OWi, and tar
ried no in.su ranee. O-idy the walls
of building remains to mark the
site of thin oiiee prettly little
ehureh. Fortunately, most of the
furniture was saved.
lust how the fire originated i
not positively known, but the
best explanation given is that the
building contained a "blind
flue." This old flue was re
placed by a new one, but the
"thimble" or opening for the pipt
to the former was not stopped,
and when the stove was sot up
this fall, the pipe was run into
the bad flue. This termined
just under the shingled roof
making a shingle cap for it
and the result can easily be fi&
ured out, as the church was be
ing cleaned up and a fire built
in the stove Friday morning. It
is said several fires had been in
the stove during the past few
weeks, and the wonder is the roof
did not catch fire before.
Hie church carried no insur
ance, we are told, owing to a
question of title to the property.
It seems this building was erect
ed some fifty yars ago by the
German Lutherans a lare and
flourishing denomination in Hick
man at that time. This church
finally dwindled in membership
until services were discontmued,
and the one or two remaining
members of the original church
seemed to be its only custodians,
who kindly offered its use to the
Christian congregation at differ
ent times. The building also has
a history as a school buildine.
But, to shorten the story, the
Christian congregation severa
years ago, were given possession
of the property and looked after
its up-keep, but the title wag stil
veiled in obscurity and uncer
tainty. Hence, it was not insura
ble.
While this structure wasalowjy
reduced to ashes and fire fight
ers were doing their untmst to
extinguish the flames and save
the residence of Mrs. S. M. Hub
bard, the residence of Mrs. Out
ten caught fire from falling' em
bers, and before it waa diacoyerci
flames were racing over the crin
gle roof. Volunteers rushed tD
the residence in an effort to
save it, but in a few minutes tla
whole roof was ablaze and the
lire beyond control. The vol
unteers then gave their attention
to tarrying out the household
goods and saved a goodly portion I
of them.
ihe regular firemen and fire
eivgine was a block or mere a-
wy fighting the church fire.
Cl fosey and bis men made a
IlgVumg change from fire No. 1
to fire No. 2. Considering the fact
hat the big engine was coupled to
a fire plyg and three lines of
hose laid,, the boys did some re
markably good work in moving.
The timely arrival of the fire en
gine is all that saved residence
of4Mrs. J. E. Fuqua and praba-
bly others as the Fuqua resi
dence waa only a few feet from
the Outten property.
The residence of Mrs. C. A.
IloJeombe was also threatened,
but did not catch.
Mrs. Outten carried $1,750 in-
-l i
surance on ner residence ana
$200 on furniture. Her loss is
probably in excess of $2500. One
other family, Mr. Toddy and fam
ily, of Jonesboro, Ark shared the
Outten residence, but saved their
household goods.
The Fuqua residence was some
what damaged, but is fully cover
ed by insurance.
This fire was the lirst real test
of the new fire engine, and she
gare a splendid account of her
self, responding to every demand
and never missed a lick. . Che
value of the engine was clearly
demonstrated. One hose was at

S. N. WHITE DIES.
LEFT HERE 30 YEARS AGO.
.Samuel N. White, a former cit
izen of Hickman and father of
Mrs. J. M. Hubbard, died at his
home in Brooksville, Fla., Friday,
after several years of ill health
and the infirmities of advanced
age. Mr. White was about 69
years old.
At one time he was a promi
nent merchant and miller of
Hickman, but he left here some
30 years ago. He is survived by
his wife and the following chil
dren: -Mrs. Lily Wall, of Tampa,
Fla., Mrs. J. M. Hubbard, of
Hickman, and Sam White, of
Jacksonville, Fla.
Many of our older readers will
remember Mr. White. He was a
splendid Christian gentleman; a
leader in social, religious and
business affairs. He was also a
prominent Mason, being the oldest
living member of Hickman Chap
ter No. 4y, lloyal Arch Masons.
When the chapter was re-organized
a few years ago, three of its
former members made the appli
cation for the charter Mr.
White, Gen. II. A. Tyler and Ex
mayor Gardner, of Union City.
These were the only living mem
bers at that time, surviving the
yellow fever epidemic in 1878,
which wiped out the local lodge.
He was also a life-long member of
the Methodist church, and oft
times filled the pulpit.
Peace to liis ashes.
Sheriff Huddleston is now tak
ing a breathing spell after the
rush of those who wanted to pay
their taxes before the penalty
went on.
Jailer Chas. Murchison says he
has only nine prisoners in the
jail at present.
