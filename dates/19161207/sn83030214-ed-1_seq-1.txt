IB? C?M? te The Tnb-n? I
London, Dec. 6. Bucharest has fall?
en. The capture of the Rumanian cap?
ital was announced officially by Berlin
to-night. The Germans now hold iOjNQ
square mile? of territorv in Rumania.
The retirement of the Rumanians
from the city and the surrounding re?
gion was forced y the advance of the
Germanic troops on three sides of the
capital. King Ferdinand's commanders
-lipped out of the enemy'-' trap early
in the day, with their forces apparently
almost intact. Evidently no effort was
made to defend the city.
The final dash of the troops of Fal
kenhayn and Mackensen on Bucharest,
was astonishingly swift, a fact partly
accounted for by the determination of
the Rumanians to give up the city as
soon a? their armies were threatened
with envelopment Vesterday the vic?
torious Danube artsy stood only ?p.i'n
miles from the outskirts of the capital.
Bv 'his morning the defenders had been
cleared from their positions and the
(ierman troops marched 'uto the ?_ii .
with little opposition.
Ploeecl Is Captured
While these operations were coing
on a movement was being carried out
by the 9th German Army in the re?
gion northwest of Bucharest that un
doubtedly brought about tiie Ruma?
nians' resolution to rttire with all
.speed.
Delminsingen's troops foBghl their
way forward fr*m the Tergovit.ia sec?
tor, reached the Ploesci-Bucharest rail?
road an?l then advanced on Ploesci.
This important town, from which radi?
ate five railroad lines, was captured to?
day.
With Ploesci in the enemy'? hands,
only one avenue of escape was left
open to the Rumanian troops in Bucha
:? ? that along the railroad to Car?
navoda. Presumably it is this route
that the retreating forces are now fol?
low ing.
Pur- of Sakharoff's' army i- in pos
ISSSion of the western end of the
bridge over which this road crosses the
Danube into the Dobrudja, so the re?
tirement of the Rumanian units in safe?
guarded at that point. From that
place another railroad runs northwest
into Moldavia.
Prahova Valley Evacuated
The fall of Ploesci had another im?
portant effect. By placing the in
vadern in the rear of the Rumanian
forces in the Prahova lector, ievth and
southeast of Kronstadt, it compelled
their speedy retirement Sinais, "the
summer capital," which lies on the
Kronstadt-Ploesci railroad, was occu?
pied by the Teutonic troops. This suc?
cessful operation will force the retire
meat of the Rumanians from the en?
tire regrlon south and east of Kron
?tadt, and will give the enemy a strong
grip on the region northwest of Uuzeu,
which now become.- their immediate
objective.
Meanwhile, the Rumanian salts
? rapped in Southwestern Waila.-hia are
rapidlv heir..; hedged in by the Teuton?.
Dwindling with each successive en?
gagement, they are forced to tight un?
der adverse conditions. In a forced
Cattle on the Alt yesterday this army
lost l,?i00 more men in prisoners, and
was compelled to retreat in confusion
toward other of the walls of men that
surround them.
In addition to this roll o? prisoner?,
the invaders took more than 4,400 more
Rumanian? in operations m other ? .
tata. Despite ti.e ?normous captures
ni^ii? t.\ the Teutaaa is the last few
days, it is apparent to militar) men
that Ferdinand has extricated the m_in
body of his troops.
Like Russian and Serb Driv?e
In this respect the world has seen a
lion of the tactics followed by
the Russians in the spring of Itli and
by trie Serbians in the fail o? the same
year, when the Teutons s".ept rapidly
through the hostile country, but failed
to destroy the opposing arnue?. Bat
the Russians and Serbs have since
proved the ?alue of men over territory.
Observen Ii'ik foi a similar sequel in
'.he case of ti e Rumania:-.-.
One of r!:e greatest benefits that has
accrued to the Teutons from the.r con?
quest of nearly one-half of all Rumania
lies in the rich stores of grain, si
other supplies seized in the conquered
lands. Berlin evinces a? much elation
over the capture yesterday of stores
of wheat, "bought by the British gov?
ernment and labelled as such by signs,"
as over the defeat of the enemy's
armies.
In the Carpathians and m Festem
Transylvania the Russians vainly at?
tempted to pince the enemy's ?inee
during the day. Ktcept in the Troitus
Valley, where Berlin admits the los? of
an advanced line of trenches, the Teu?

FRANCE TO FOLLOW BRITISH EXAMPLE
IN SPEEDING UP GOVERNMENT FOR WAR
By FRED B. PITNEY
Hy 'able to The Tribune.'
Paris, Dec. .">.?Following the example of F'.ngland, changes of mo?
ment can be foreseen also in France. In fact, the coming to a head of"
i the English situation has only hastened in France developments which
were practically certain.
The secret session of the Chamber of Deputies has now almost
reached its end. It probably would have luted several days longer, and
there is little reason to doubt that the result would have been the same,
but after the English action further discmsaiofl was practically im?
possible.
Demand for Immediate Action
Tiiere- im- beeil s funeral demand for immediate action here. The
Radical arid Radical-Soria'ist groups in Um Chamber of Deputies re?
cently adopted this resolution:
"In the interests of national defence it is urgent thst the secret
session of the Chamber end as soon aa possible, and that in a precise
resolution the people's representatives point out to the government the
demands of the country."
There is no doubt as to what ih\< mean's and that the action will
be in accord with the resolution.
Pierre Renaudel in to-day's "Humanit?" predicts the immediste
end of the secret session, ami say-: "I feel safe in saying that the meas?
ures demanded by the Chamber will ' e adopted." He adds
"I can see that we are on the road to a national assembly, which,
if not exactly the same thing as the Committee of Public Safety of the
Revolution, yet will In? very close to it."
Hani Precise Programme
The changes will look to greater action and to pushing the war.
The "Temps" say? to-night:
'We must have?as the resolution of the Radical-Socialists shows
plainly ?results from the secret session, and not orders of the day,
vague and diffusive, with sentences adroitly balanced and formulas
nicely calculated to mean nothing. We must have a programme laid
down w ith precision."
This is what will come at the end of the secret session, and there
will be a reorganisation which will mean getting on with the war,
although, as I said before, it is not likely that there will lie changes in
the government.

irisi?. He said that it became appar?
ent, especially in the matter of man
power, that no serious grip was being
maintained by the jrovernment on the
positios .vhich existed.
What was required, he said, wa? B
sm?x!l committee which could come to
B decision quickly on any question and
BSaJu the department concerned carry
out the decisions arrived at. Unless
that xverc done there would be great
danger that the plans of the General
Staff might fail in the coming year.
For this reason, Lord Derby said, he
associated himself with the proposals
of Lloyd George, which provided that
the War Committee ?hould consider all i
real questions in regard to the var. |
cii-.stituting, in fact, a vx-ar cabinet. It.-1
duties xyould be to consider carefully'
?very possible proposal, and, lobbing
forward, to anticipate what the policy ?
should be. Having adopted a policy,
lie said, the committee would stick to
it and se? it through.
It was proposed further -.hat the
Premier should be required to attend
all meetings and should have power to
veto proposals of the committee. The
difficulty arose over the composition
of this committee.
Declaring that ho knew of no in?
trigue, and would have nothing to do
with an intrigue if it existed. Lord
Derby made a strong appeal to the con?
flicting ministers to ?ink their differ?
ences.
"To go back to party administra?
tion," he said, "would spell ruin for
th.s country. Is it too much to ask for
reciprocal consideration?
"We want tho best men of all par?
ties, and 1 feel it will arouse an echo
here, and probably in the counrry. If
we nppea! ?o all men. even at thll
eleventh hc i;r, to sink their di!ferenc?s,
ami under, perhaps, nex/ leadership?
give us still the best men of both sides
for the proper currying or. of the xvar."

George is Britain'.- Premnr. In co

strive to organize a ministry.
Thus, after a week a. strata, t-M
atmosphere ha-, cleared. The ciim*

".here are indications that the prob

The new mini try wiil be forme i
from a coalition in al! probability,
Britain's chief sia'esmen having
fought each other to such a stand?
still that compromise i- the only
method of bringing order out of
chaos.
Little ( h.inze in I'olirv.
(There wiil be railtcal changes in
the government, but the new mem
ber3 will be fe?v in number. The
ganara! policy with regard to the
pro.?ctition of the war ?ill undergo
little transformation.
Lloyd George will asslUM Uta Pre?
miership only with .the understand
ing that if he fails to command s
working majority he will dissolve
the government immediately and call
a general election.
In the formation of a new ministry
Lloyd George faces on?- of the most

The Irish Nationalists will be en?

?ment only by an offer of unadul?

Flection Seem? in Sight
Still another fact utands out frim
the maze of speculation ??Mowing in
the wake of the kaleidoscopic ?iiar.ges
of the laut few days. More and BMM
keen political observers are hourly
joining the ranks of thooe who con?
tend that a general election is the
only true, solution of the present pre?
dicament, and that it will be only a
matter of a short time before the
country becomes convinced of the same
thing and demands a voice in the selec?
tion of Britain's governors.
With this in view, the prediction is
more than local that a few weeks will
see the return of Asquith to the head
of the government. Of all the possible
candidates he is the only one who can
command a strong majority, who can
count on the full support of the Labor
ites, who can be a.sured of confidence
because of h.s past record

tinuous shifts and changes. In the
morning Bonar I-ew had an audience
with the King, telling the latter that
he felt it was impossible for him to
undertake the formation of a new
ministry.
This afternoon, apparently in an
irffort to bring about an understanding,
octween the opposing factions, the
King called the party leaders to DM
palace, and was closeted with then,
for more than an hour. With tha
sovereign were Asquith, Lloyd George,
Law, Balfour and Henderson, the last

party. The presence of Balfour cre?
ated much attention, for he has been
