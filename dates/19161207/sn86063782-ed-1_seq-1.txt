Wilson In Message
Asks MoreContr
Declares That Their Operation
Should Not Be Stopped
or Interrupted by the Concerted
Action of Organized
Bodies of Men Until a Public
Investigation Shall Have
Been Instituted.
IN one of the shortest messages
ever sent to congress Tresident
Wilson urges that early action
De uiKen ro complete nis program
of "settlement and regulation"
recommended at the last session. The
message In full Is as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon me by the constitution of
communicating to you from time to
time Information of the state of the
Union and recommending to your con
slderatlon such legislative measures as
may be Judged necessary and expedl
ent I shall continue the practice, which ,
I hope has been acceptable to you. of ,
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments
the elaboration of the detailed needs
of the public service and confine my
self to those matters of more general
public policy with which It seems nee
essary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my suggestions
as few as possible. But there
were some .things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
to do at once.
The Railroad Problem.
In the first place, It seems to me lm ?
peratively necessary that the earliest 1
possible consideration and action lE
should be accorded the remaining h
measures of the program of settlement
?' and regulation Vhlch I had occasion to 10
recommend to you at the close of your
last session In view of the publlb dangers
disclosed by the unaccommodated m<
difficulties which then existed and
which still unhappily continue to ex
1st between the railroads of the coun *r
try and their locomotive engineers. vi
conductors and trainmen.
I then recommended: 'ts
First, Immediate provision for the e3
enlargement and administrative reor- at
ganlzatlon of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied 00
In the bill recently passed by the house t0
of representatives and now awaiting fo
action by the senate In order that the' tri
commission may be enabled to deal &r
with the many great and various du Al
ties now devolving upon It with n nc
promptness and thoroughness which ^
are, with its present constitution and ru
means of action, practically Impossible. ce
Second, the establishment of an eight D?
hour day as the legal basis alike of w
nf tvitcpq In the emnlovment '
of all railway employees who are actually
engaged lu the work of operat w
lug trains In Interstate transportation. at.
Third, the authorization of the ap- ltf
polntment by the president of a small of
body of men to observe the actual re- th
suits In experience of the adoption of re
the eight hour day in railway transpor- co
tatlon alike for the men and for the
railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con- I
gress of the consideration by the in- to
terstate commerce commission of an m,
Increase of freight rates to meet such tl<
additional expenditures by the rail- tli
roads as may have been rendered nec- sii
essary by the adoption of the eight 1
hour day and which have not been off- xe
set by administrative readjustments hi
and economies, should the facts dis- of
closed Justify the increase. a i
Fifth, an amendment of the exlsthi;; P1'
* federal statute which provides for the Wl
mediation, conciliation and arbitration ^
of such controversies as the present by ru
adding to it a provision that. In case st
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fall, a full publh- U1
Investigation of the merits of every l'
such dispute shall be Instituted au.l w
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted. is
Control by the Executive.
And, sixth, the lodgment in the '
hands of the executive of the powei '
in case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll tll
lng stock of the railways of the coun- nj
try as may be required for military of
use aud to operate them for military or
purposes, with authority to draft into ar
the military service of the United ar
States such train crews and admiuis ca
tratlve officials as the circumstances tl<
require for their safe and efficient use
The second and third of these ret- bi
ommendations the congress immediate el'
ly acted on: It established the eight Vc
hour day as the legal basis of work or
aud wages in train service and it au- at
thorized the appointment of a com mis- be
gion to observe and report upon the gj
practical results, deeming these the al
measures most Immediately needed, but m
It postponed action upon the other suggwtlona
until an opportunity should be a>
offered for a more deliberate consider- ; hi
atton of them. h<
The fourth recommendation I do not ei
deem it necessary to renew. The pow-1 C(

ELECTORAL CALLEGE
Federal Constitution Amendment tc
Have President Chosen by Popular
Vote Planned.
Carrying a proposed amendment t<
the Federal Constitution, abolishing
the electoral college, Senator Georg*
Chamberlain, Democrat, of Oregon, ii
en route to Washington.He believes th<
electoral college Is obsolete and thai
the President should be chosen by di
rect popular vota
In explaining that the electoral col
lege system might furstate the will ol
the majority, Chamberlain pointed out
that in the presidential election 5,00C
votes in California might have swung
that State to Hughes and elected him,
whereas Wilson had a popular lead ol
400,000 votes throughout the country
Chamberlain said his amendment
would be proposed so it could become
effective at the 1020 election.
RENEWS PROTEST ON
DEPORATION
Araerca Acts in Case of Belgians.
Washington, Dec. 1.?Acting on its
own behalf, the American government
has informed Germany anew ol
its deep concern over the deportation
of Belgians from thir own country
by the German military authorities,
This acion has been taken as a result
of niformatlon about the deportations
gahered from different sources and
after fruitless Inquiries as to the
Belgians made by American Charge
Grew at Berlin.
Germany has been informed {that
the treatmei|t of the {.Belgians has
made a very bad impression in this
country and that the United Sates
can not avoid taking notice of the
broad grounds of humanity.
The American government, it was
learned today, was led to moe not
only because of the xpressed feeling
that the deportations have been looked
upon with disfavor by he American
people and government but because of
fear that Belgian rllef work, which is
administered by Americans, may be
interfered with.
. -^MJl^ELBCmON LAWS_
Should Psdftti&lt lAutntlan Ballofc
Says Anderson Paper
(From the Anderson Intelligencer.)
Following the recent Democratic
primary In this State there were
charges of fraud made by one faction
against the other, though no protest
was filed and no contest made before
the State executive committee of the
party. The charges were regarded as
a thin and filmy way of easing out
of defeat, and were never taken seriously
by the public.
But out of the discussion of these
alleged frauds grew talk of making
the Australian ballot system the lawful
method of choosing public officers.
Prominent members of both factions
tiave given their endorsement to the
scheme, and now would certainly appear
a good time for the Legislature to
press the matter and make the system
the law of the State while the demand
for it Is fresh In the minds of the
people. It certanly could not at this
time be made a factional Issue, as it
tias the support of both factions.
The prima ry election law passed in
1011 woo n inntr sten foward in purg
"?* * " o ?- ----ing
the primary of flagrant abases,
and the adoption of the Australian
ballot would naturally fit In as a sort
:>f final chapter In the movement to
reform and purify the elections. There
ire always purchasable votes, whose
support can be won by an outright
?ash consideration or by promises
that are equivalent to a purchase. The
Australian ballot system would help
to reduce the danger from this element
>f voters, as the secrecy required In
iepositing their ballots would make
it increasngly difficult for polltc&l
mainpulators to depend upon them.
The tme is ripe for passing the
measures and we hope that it will be
pressed vigorously at the coming seadon
of the Legislature, and pushed
through while t has such an excellent
;hance of passage.
Savannah News.
There is a difference of opinion?
very wide difference?about the feel*
Lng of the National Guardsman as an
Individual toward 'the government as
a result of his tour of duty on the
border. The truth is, of course, that
[iifferent guardsmen entertain a variety
of feelings in this respect It
would be easy to quote a lot of them
who think they have not had a square
Jeal and that the government had no
reason for taking them away from
home and business and sending them
down where the mesquite flourishes
and the stand storm is in vigor. And
It would be just as easy to quote a
lot of them who are ready to "do it
all over again," who are glad they have
bad the experience that has come to
them on the border, who realize that
they have been made better men phyeilally
and better citizens.

WHY COTTON IS HIGH
The Wall Street Journal's Ftpl?lite
of Present Prices.
Spot cotton on the New Yotfc Exchange
averaged 19.88 cents a pound
in November of this year, or fftlltO a
bale. There were times in that Month
when it sold as high as 20.95 cents,
or |y01.75 a bale. Its course since
the 16th day of November, 1914* when
the Exchange reopened, is almost on*
belle veble.
Many of those who deal mn*t in
cotton feared that it would not Some
back?war would destroy the market
Accordingly, the average price fte the
November, 1914. period was 7.67 seats,
or $38.35 a bale for a product that
costs at least $50 to produce. The
following month was still more Moomy
and the average price went to 135.
From that time on it la an interesting
study to trace the upward course.
Step by step, sometimes losing a little
ground, but always regainteg k,
the advance was maintained until De
cemoer, 1U10, ciosea wiuj 1u smigv
of 12.33 cents a pound.
With some recessions the trance
was steadily maintained throsghont
the past months of 1910, but ft vu
not until July that cotton cm* off
the shackles of doubt and fear and
entered the lists as a real Marathon
runner.
Short crop is pointed to M the
cause of this advance It is tma the
crop is short and wo Id supply wna'I.
But there mus" he a use f??r It. el*
there would be no response to atotl!*
ness of suiply. And that is & rati
secret of c ?tt?n*s advance.
It Is hard to realize how i*?liflil
cotton has become to the In ill r lie
of the world, ootn in war ana pac?
It Is not so much In the numier of
consumers as In the discovery of new
uses. It Is as necessary to the auto
mobile monufacturer as It la to the
surgeons working behind the firing
lines In Europe. The great ocean
liners carry with them more canvas
than the old-time vessels that once
whitened the seas with their safla
In the manufacture of harvesting
machines It as necessary as la the
plant that manufactures electric lighting
wires. The eatlogue of lb industrial
uses la a long one?tee long
to enumeratei In the past cenflTy its
use has Increased twenty-threw times
faster than population, and the latter
half of the last decade shows its
Industrial value Is only now b?Wiling
malnlfest
So long as the wheels of edustry
go round they will cause a doaasad tot
