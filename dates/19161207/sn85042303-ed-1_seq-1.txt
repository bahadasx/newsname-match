Co-operation Labor to be Given
adequate Representation.
London,- Dee. 7. Lloyd George, the
new prime minister, opened negotia
tions today with the labor party with
a view to securing its support and co

Moyd (ieorge the backing of ail
unionist members, seventy liberal
and probably the labor members.

party two cabinet seats and one rep
resentative in the war council and
the offer was accepted.

different policy toward the people
with whom they are dealing, and In
tills connection, there could be no
greater boon to those who use the
Rlngling road than that a new sched
ule be adopted for their passenger
! service. A passenger schedule that
! would be pleasing to the citizens of
Ardmore and to those in every town
I served by the road, w ould be one that
called for a train leaving this city at
I six thirty in the morning, returning

the afternoon and returning from

This would give people from Rlnfc

'the railroad, an opportunity of com

'would also give oil men an opportunl

BEN MOBLEY WAS APPOINTED
TO SUCCEED RETIRING MAYOR.
WILSON IS AGITATING DIFFER
ENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
At a rousing meeting of the city
council at Wilson Wednesday night.
many matters of vital Importance to
that city were discussed which event
ually led to Mayor Primer tendering
his resignation to the city council,
which was by them accepted, and Hen
K. Moliley was unanimously chosen
to succeed him. Mr. Moliley was a
member of the city council before hj
was elevated to the ofllce of mayor.
The consensus of opinion of tho
council was that the retiring mayor
has had a hard row to hoe as Is usu
ally the case In all new towns. He
has b i censured for some of his
acts, but not more than many other
officials have been. Hut tho retiring
mayor did many things for the ad
vancement of the town.
There Is a strong sentiment In Wil
son at the present lime to abol.sh the
present system of government anil
adopt the city manager plan or
the commission form. This may be
done in the near future.
Mr. Moliley has resided In tills
county for many years and since the
town of Wilson was established. Ho
has taken an active part In all city
affairs and will make a good city of
ficial. Wil.-on is taking on new life and
with a live commercial club, live
newspaper and business administra
tion of municipal affairs that hustling
little city is bouna to grow-.
The question of paving Is now the
foremost iilfiat agitating the business
men of Wilson and there Is not the
slightest doubt but what work In this
dlrec'ion will begin very soon.
