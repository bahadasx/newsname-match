TRIED IN FISCAL COURT
Big Crowd Attended the
Meeting Tuesday and Many
Arguments Made.
The Fiscal Conrt met in monthly
session Tuesday find the most impor
tant matter to come up was the ques
tion of removing Dr. W. W. Durham
from his position as a member of the
County Road Commission from the
northwestern scdjon of the county.
At the last meeting DjDurfiam was
cited to appear and'show cause why
he should not be removed. . A peti
tion was filed with the court contain
ing about 250 names of persons in
tl.."1 part of the county asking tht hn
be removed because he had accepted
the position of second assistant physi
cian at the Western State Hospital and
had moved into another portion of
the county. The claim was set up
that he held two salaried offices con
trary to the constitution of the state.
Dr. Durham appeared in person and
was represented by Attorneys Jas.
Breathitt, Thos. P. Cook, Frank Rives
and Otho Anderson, all of whom
made speeches for him and Dr. Dur
ham made a statement himself and
his attorn6yj5 tiled a counter petition
with 600 names asking.tnat he be not
rqmoved. His attorneys took the po
sition that neither of the positions
held by Dr. Durham were "offices"
under the constitution and Judge
Breathitt read a decision from Lex
ington in the case of Wills vs. Scott,
in which the Court of Appeals had
decided that the superintendency of
the Lexington State Hospital was not
an "office."
J. D. Capps, representing the first
petitioners,saidthe people needed and
wanted a local representative and that
Dr. Durham held a state appointment
at $1200 and the other place that paid
$3 a day, not exceeding $100 in one
year. He" said his lime belonged tp
the state and he could not discharge
the duties of the road commission
ship. Replying to this, Dr. Durham said
his Hospital duties were performed in
the forenoon and he had more'time to
devote to the work than when he
practiced medicine. Besides the com
missioners were not engineers but
attended only to executive details.
County Attorney Ira D. Smith rec
ommended to the court that the place
be declared vacant, since it was evi
dent that Dr. Durham had .abandoned
the district from which he was ap
pointed and left a large number of
dissatisfied constituents without local
, rppresentation in the expenditure of
$100,000. One member wjio moved
out of his district promptly resigned
and since Dr. Durham had not fol-
I lowed this precedent the court, wlth
' out meaning any disrespect to him,
should declare his place vacant and
let the Christian County Good RoadB
1 Association meet as soon as possible
and recommend a resident member
of ttio same political party to repre
sent that road district.
A motion was made to go into ex
ecutive session to consider the matter
further. The motion resulted in a tie
nmi .Tiwtrrn KninM vnfrv) in thn affirm
' ative. In executive session the mat
ter came to a vote and by a vote qf 5
to 3 the position was declared vacant
and the Good Roads Association asked
to make a recommendation Dec. 12th.
The vote stood: Ayes Morris, Dade,
Rives, Reese and " Rogers. Nays

stormy years of domestic and foreign
history. The Unionist leader, An
drew Bonar Law, was summoned to
tho palace immediately after Mr. As
quitli had departed and the King
offered him the Prime Minister's
commission, which he had just ac
cepted from Mr. Asquith's hands.
Thus the Government crisis found
a solution, which up to the hour of its
announcement was considered the
least probable of practical alterna
tives. ' BONAR LAW UNDECIDED.
No announcement regarding Mr.
Bonar Law's decision has yet been
made, and there are some doubts
whether he will accept the heavy re
sponsibility. If he declines, it is con
sidered certain that the honor will
fall to . David Lloyd-George. The
continuation of the Coalition Cabinet
with some changes in its member
ship, and the speedingj up of the war
management will be the policy in
either event.

J.ftHYERS,
Huge Yellow Flag With Ques-
tion Dropped from Gallery
During Reading Message.
PRES. WILSON JUST SMILES
Page Snatches Banner Down
Women Gleeful Over
Success of Their Strategem.
Washington, Dec. 6. President
Wilson's address to congress was
marked by a woman suffrage coup
in the galleries the first real show of
organized militancy in the capitol
and bjjgrc.u demonstration of con
gratulation t" the president upon his
re-election in which many republicans
joined with the democrats.
After acknowleding the prolonged
cheersfand applause which greeted his
entry to the hall of the house, the
president launched into his address,
reviewing recommendations for rail
road legislation, a corrupt practice act
and had passed to his recommenda
tions for a border government for
Porto Rico. He had just about begun
a sentence: "The present laws gov
erning the island and regulating the
rights and privileges of its people are
not just" when over the rail of the
gallery where sat a party of woman
suffrage leaders there fluttercdown
above the heads of an amazed assem
blage of senators and representatives
a silk banner of suffrage yellow,
bearing in great black letters this in
scription: ..President Wilson, what will you
do for woman suffrage' '
JEALOUS OVER PORTO RICO.
The suffragists said afterward, it
was their protest against the presi
dent's plea with congress for broader
suffrage for the men of Porto Rico
while he didn't mention their own
cause in his address.
As the banner rippled down, the
suffragists sat smiling and unperturb
ed watching the effect. A small page,
raised on the arms of men directly
under the gallery, grasped the edge
of the banner and snatched it down.
President Wilson attracted by the stir,
looke 1 up from his reading and ap
parently taking in the situation al a
glance, smiled broadly and without
hesitation or interruption, turned his
eyes back to his manuscript, and con
tinued his address to its end without
further demonstrations.
Policemen and gallery guards scur
ried to where the womenwere seat
ed but contented themselves with
watching tho party, as if to prevent a
further outbreak.
When the joint session was over
the suffragists filed out unmolested
by the police who said they had no
orders other than to prevent any
further infringement of the rules of
the house. The banner remained a
trophy with the sergeant-at-arms.

WAITING NEW
DEVELOPMENTS
Public Unwilling To Let The
Katherine Denton Mat- .
ter Drop.
The burial of the woman known as
Katherine Denton has been postponed
until Friday and the conviction is
growing that the police are working
on a cluo that will throw more light
on the ease in the end. It is general
ly believed, at least by the people of
the vicinity where the school house
was burned, that there was a man in j
the qase. The school house was a I
dilapidated affair with an old stove '
fire in it that had no pipe to it and yet a 1

late in the night. The authorities are
getting very little assistance in clear-'
ing up the mystery from some who
might be reasonably expected to take
an interest in the matter. There is a
decided indisposition in some quar-'
ters to discuss the matter. The wo
man evidently came from some city, '
probably St. Louis. If she was miss-1
ing from a small community even
from a city as large as Evansville
the wide publicity that has been given
the case would have found some one
who knew her. 1 he matter ought
not to be allowed to rest as it is.
There should bs an inquest held and
some legal inquiry made into the
facts that led up to the trigedy. It is
possible to find some one who knows
more than has been told.

Highest Prices In Years Paid
For Tobacco Tuesday
at Cooper's.
ALL GRADES ARE STRONG
About 150,000 Pounds Sold
The First Day With
Many Buyers.
The opening of the Loose Floor
tobacco market Tuesday was very
satisfactory. Beginning at the Han
cock Warehouse Co., sales were1 held
at all of the six loose floors, closing at
the Cooper warehouse in the after
noon. The aggregate was about
150,000 pounds and prices went as
high as $15.25 for one lot sold on the
West Floor and $1G.00 for one sold
at Cooper's. A big crowd was pres
ent and practically all of the 25 or 30
regular buyers were present.
The following report nf the sale
is as it was seen by Secretary II. H
Abernathy, of the Tobacco Board of
Trade:
The Loose Floor held an opening
sale on Tuesday 5th. This sale showed
some ot the excitement that tne
market was expecting. The loose
floors claim that buyers making a
purchase in the country and picking
their crops should pay an average of
$1.50 to $2.00 more than a sale of a
similar amount of similar character
would bring, if sold on the loose
lloor. If they have been doing that
they must have paid some very high
prices that have not yet been reported.
The loose floor men claim that prices
are entirely too low now, if the con
ditions of the market are understood.
In the first place the European coun
tries now at war did not make any to
bacco this year, nor can they make it
next year even if the war should end.
Tiie women and children are tryintr
to make something to eat. Europe
ordinarily makes the greater part of
the tobacco that it uses. We only
furnish about one-fourth so if they
have to buy all, they use from us the
market should yet he elevated from
$3.00 to $5.00 and not only is this
the case but it is claimed that the
embargo shuts out Germany and
Austria Hungary, so if the war ceases
both of these countries will be on the
market and some very high prices
will be paid.
The European, as well as all other
countries, are forced to furnish their
armies with tobacco. Individuals do
season.
Trash $0.50 to $7.50
Lugs $7.50 to $8.50.
Low Leaf $8.50 to $10.00
Medium Leaf $10.00 to $11.04".
Fine Leaf $15.25 to $16.00.
Sales will be held daily hcrUt r
throughout the season.
PRIVATE SALES
Two Leading Farmers Sell
Tobacco Crops at $11. 5Q
and $12.00.
Some more big sales of tobacco
have been made privately this week.
The Kentucky Leaf & Transit Co.
bought J. T. Garnett's crop of 100,
00P pounds at $11,50 round, and also
bought tho crop of T. W. Garr.ctt,
about 20,000 pounds at $12 mh-'?.
This is the best price paid for u jdj
of that size so far as has been rejwrti
ed. Tho samo company has bought
a good many crops at $11.
