STOLE OUR THANKSGIVING
TURKEY?
In the refrigerator at tho White
House Hotel; lay a line young turkey,
ready for the Thanksgiving feast. The
family, from the baby to tho grand-
lather, had taken occasional peeps at
the turkey throuchout the day and had
gone to bed talking about the feast to
morrow; but, alas! a "thief in the
night" stole the turkey, and consterna
tion reigned at the White House.
"Dad" Mansfield came to the rescue
and presented a fine turkey, Not many
minutes were lost in preparing the
young gobbler for the oven, and in
spite of the fact of losing our first tur
key, we had a Thanksgiving dinner.
The turkey, doubly more precious to
us because of the loss, tasted much
better than any we had over eaten,
while the other dishes, spiced with
merrjment caused by the accident,
made this feast the greatest In our
remembrance.
The following partook of tho feast:
Mrs. Brown, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Tack,
Misses Shoemaker, of Wichita, Louise
Boyle, of Woodward, Dunkle, Wright,
Messrs. Folsom, Tack, Sohmidt, Hulse,
Munsell, Mansfield, Steele, Gardner,
Graham, and C, E. Tackett and wife.
