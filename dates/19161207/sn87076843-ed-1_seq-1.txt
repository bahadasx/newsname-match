Perrysburg closed their 1916
foot ball season at Fremont on
Thanksgiving with their first de
feat. With the aid of H. Munger
as coach, Perrysburg had the best
team in the town's history, equal
to any amateur team in the state.
During the season the Perrys
burg team has scored 140 points
while their opponents have se
cured only 19.
The Pcrrysburg-Gcnoa game
scheduled for last Sunday was
cancelled by Genoa Saturday
morning. This was too short a
notice for the locals to secure a
game.
MAPPING SCENERY OF OHIO.
A map showing the location of
points of scenic and historic inter
est in Ohio is being prepared at
the Ohio State University. In
order to .make it as complete as
possible, every resident of the
state is invited to send informa
tion. Replies should be addressed
at once to P. II. Elwood, Ilorti
cultural Building, Ohio State Uni
versity, Columbus, Ohio. The map
is expected not only to make avail
able much valuable information to
students and tourists but to de
velop interest in spots that have
been hitherto comparatively un
known to the country at large.
STOCKROLDERS MEETING
The stockholders of the Perrys
burg Grain and Seed company held
their annual meeting at the town
hall on Tuesday afternoon. There
was a large percentage of the stock
represented and the members ex
pressed themselves as well pleased
with the enterprise.
The board of Directors will re
main the same as during the past
year by the re-election of the mem
bers whose terms had expired.
The question of increasing the
capital stock to $40,000 met with
the unanimous approval of the
stockholders.
A general discussion of the com
pany's business and prospects was
had and a feeling of universal sat
isfaction was manifested. .
After the business session was
closed President Emmerich and
Director A. J. Witzler treated the
stockholders to a fine luncheon a
special feature being a 75 pound
venison roast which was a part of
one of the deer Mr.Witzler brought
home from his recent hunting.
That the company is a live one
with bright future prospects was
very apparent.
DEATH OF MRS. BULLMAN
Mrs. Clarinda C. Bullman for
merly of Perrysburg, Ohio, died at
the home of her youngest son Allen
Bullman of Northville, Mich., aged
85 years, 9 mo. and 2-1 days.
Mrs. Bullman was the daughter
of Robert and Martha Shaw who
were among the early settlers of
Perrysburg.
Deceased joined the M. E.church
of Perrypjburg when 15 years of
age and continued a faithful chris
tian till death.
NEGLECTED COLDS GROW WORSE
A dough that racks and irritates
the throat may lead to a serious
chronic cough, if neglected. The heal
ing' pine balsams in Dr. Bell's Pino
Tar Honey Nature's own remedy
will soothe and relieve the irritation,
breathing will be easier, and the anti
septic properties will kill tho germ
which retarded healing. Have it
handy for croup, sore throat and chron
ic bronchial attections. Uet a bottlo
to-day. Pleasant to take. At all

It is probable that boating on the
beautiful Maumee reached its max
imum in the few years between
1874 and 1890, for to the best of
my recollection there was a larger
number of pleasure boats owned
and used in Perrysburg in those
few years than at any time before
or since. There were all kinds of
boats, from the crude article of a
few boards nailed together to the
fine clinker-built boats, nicely
painted and varnished and with
upholstered seats. Rowing in those
days was considered fine exercise,
and in tho summer evenings the
surface of the river would be dot
ted with numerous boats, the oc
cupants of which were out for
fresh air and exercise.
Most of the boats on the river
were built in the 'burg, but a few
of them were made by J. "W. Hep
burn & Bro., the crack boat build
ers located for a number of years
in Toledo. The one man who per
haps built more boats in our town
than any other individual was
George Lafarree, while his brother,
Gus Lafarree, was a close second.
Nearly all of the boats built by
these two gentlemen were made of
white pine, w'ere built on graceful
lines, and were good and substan7
tial craft. There were mooring
places all along the river front
from the old bayou just above
Ilirth's tannery down to Thorn
ton's brickyard, and it was no un
common sight to see a dozen boats
moored in the little bayou between
the old mill dock and the big dock
at the foot of Louisiana avenue.
These boats were used for nu
merous purposes, but mostly for
pleasure riding and for fishing.
Also they were occasionally bor
rowed by crowds of small boys
(without the knowledge or consent
of the owners), when they were
possessed with an overwhelming
desire for a swimming fest over on
Big Island, where there was a nice
sandy bottom, "War Club Island, or
across the river at the locks of the
old "side cut," now abandoned,
where the water from the Miami
and Erie Canal, emptied into the
river. And the average boy of
that period knew just how to sep
ai'ate a padlock and chain from
any staple to which it was attached
in record-breaking time, and with
out either injury or damage to
either tho lock or staple. However,
the boats were generally returned
to their proper mobriiig places
within a reasonable time.
There were other times when
the hoys could indulge in their de?
sire for being on the water in boats
of which they could not claim the
ownership, and that was when
there would be a lake vessel at the
foot of Louisiana avenue for the
purpose ot taking on a cargo or
oak staves, of which there was
such an enormous quantity shipped
from Perrysburg in years gone by.
Sometimes there would be from
six to a dozen vessels loaded at this
dock in a single season. Usually
the captains were generous and
good natured, and were not averse
to loaning the yawl boat of their
good ship to the crowds of small
boys who were usually clamoring
for this privilege as soon as the
vessel was made fast to the wharf.
And they certainly were safe boats
for a crowd of boys to be in, for
the writer was on one occasion a
member of a party of about a
dozen boys on an excursion to.Big
Island in one of these big yawls
wheu we tried to capsize it, and
after working hard for over an
hour and being unable to make it
do moro than dip a little water, we

Tho fifth Annual Farmers' "Week
will be held in Columbus from Jan
uary 29 to February 2 at the Ohio
btate University. During that
week the institution throws its
doors wide open to the agricultural
interests of the state. Every ros-
siblo effort is made to offer in
struction, inspiration and educa
tional entertainment for the farm
ers and their families. Sixty lec
tures and demonstrations on agri
culture and home economics by the
leading authorities of Ohio and of
tho United States are scheduled
for the program.
If the ground is not too wet or
frozen, continue to spread nianuro
freely and turn it under. Fall
plowing will assist in making the
organic matter available. It will
also bring to the surface multi
tudes of the larvae of harmful in
sects, and will cover up others nor
mally nearer the surface so as to
prevent their emergence next
spring.
Mulch the strawberry bed after
the ground freezes with three or
four inches of coarse straw. This
will protect the plants from alter
nate freezing and thawing. "When
partially raked aside in the early
spring, the mulch will serve to re
tain the moisture and keep the
fruit clean.
The tops of the asparagus bed
should be cut, thrown into the fire
and burned by this time. After
the- ground freezes apply a heavy
coat of manure. Three or four
inches will not be too much to ap
ply. L. M. Montgomery, Depart
ment of Horticulture, Ohio State
University.

A dull and pimply skin is due to a
sluggish bowel movement. Correct
this condition and clear your complex

SLOAN'S LINIMENT EASES PAIN
Sloan's Liniment is first thought of
mothers for bumps, bruises and sprains
that are continually happening to chil
dren. It quickly penetrates and
soothes without rubbing.Cleaner and
more effective than mussy plasters or
ointments. For rheumatic aches, neu
ralgia pain and that grippy soreness
after colds, Sloan's Liniment gives
prompt relief. Have a bottle handy
for bruises, strains, sprains and all
external pain. For the thousands
whose work "calls them outdoors, the
pains and aches following exposure
are relieved by Sloan's Liniment. At
all Druggists, 25c.
