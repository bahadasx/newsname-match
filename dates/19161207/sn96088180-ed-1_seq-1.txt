tondon, Dee. 7.-Tbe labor party
has agreed to participate In the new
government now being formed by
David Lloyd-George, the Presa Aua
elation announced officially today.
fhe Cent ml New declared Lloyd
George had offered the Ubor party
two cabinet placee, on member or
the war council and three under-sec-rctsryshlps.
London, Dec. 7.The supreme
question of the hour In Kb aland to
day waa whether David IJoyd-George
would succeed la forming a new cab
inet. In hla way stood the bitterness dis
played by certain frlenda of the old
regime, end vyeaterday'a formal re
fusal of other liberal party ministers
to nerve under Andrew Bonar-Law,
which mease now also under Uoyd-
Oeorge, since Law Is on of Lloyd-
George'i most, whole-hearted sup
; porters. ... . .r,-,',,- -
But those familiar with the cour
age, determination, resourcefulness,
personal magnetism and good luck
of the late war minister, were not
entertaining reslons doubts today
over hla ability to surmount these
obstacle. It waa believed likely he
will make a forceful appeal to all
parties patriotically to sink their pol
itical differences In the single pur
pose of waging an energetic and suc-
ceaaful oonduot of the war.
Lloyd-George baa plenty of excel
lent material from which to draw his
cabinet. Among the names which
were most prominently mentioned to
day ai possible ministers were:
Bonar-Law, Unionist: Lord Cur
ion, -Unionist; the Earl of Derby,
Unionist; Lord 'Mllner, Unionist;
Winston Churchlll, Liberal; Lord
Robert Cecil, blockade minister In
the late cabinet, Unionist; Arthur
Henderson, minister of pensions in
the late cabinet liaborlte; Lord Dev
, on port, Unionist; 81 r Henry Dais I el,
Liberal; and Ixrd Reading, Liberal
The chief difficulty which Lloyd
George facet la In lining up sufficient
support la commons for his minis
try. The present political complex
ion of the house Is: - - - -
Unionist, W: Liberals, ISO; La

It is bettered tha new cabinet mak
er will erentually enlist tha support
of tha Labor party, in new of his
known purpose mora liberally to
recognise that party's claims In the
new ministry. Only one member-
Arthur Henderson minister of pen
aloni, waa on tha Asqulth cabinet
toll.
The Labor party has been very an
tagonistic heretofore to the war, hut
because of Lloyd-Oeorge'a friendship
toward social Justice measures before
tha war, it Is possible he may be able
to line up many of the labor party
members.
Arthur Henderson, Laborlte, came
to see Lloyd-George fresh from an
early morning meeting of members
of hi party. This conference of the
Laborltcs adopted resolutions regret'
ting the government's delay In pre'
venting the Increase In fond prlrefl
and urging the purchase by tne gov'
ernment of all food Imports', the

reigns everywhere and tha misery of
tha Inhabitants la terrible. Most of
It la dua to the Roumanian govern

It Is to bring order out of this
chaos that General von Tulff, mili

He Is now en route here with two
generals and an entire staff.

The Roumanians, ordered from

Washington, Dec. 7. Germany
sent up the contention that the Brit
Ish steamer Arabia was a troop trans
port, and admitted, she bad aunk It
under that belief, In her answer to
American Inquiries, made public by
the state department today.
. At the name time Germany agreed
to "promptly draw appropriate coa

showed the vessel was an ordinary
passenger liner, rather than a trans

The text of the message said the
following results were shown by the
German Investigation:
"On the morning of November (,
the German submarine encountered a
Urge steamer coming from tba Cergi
straits. 100 nautical miles west of the
Island of Cerigo.
"The steamer waa painted black
and had black superstructure and not

As wa rods through Rammlcu and
Walkta, tha wildest anarchy pre
vailed. The streets were littered
with household goods, papers, win

Meanwhile bands of Roumanian
gypsies went from house to house,
and shop to shop, smashing windows
and again plundering the homes al
ready half-destroyed. These plund
ering bands men, women and child
ren piled what they could not carry
on their own backs on stolen horses
or cows. It was the same sight we
encountered In scores of other Rou
manian villages. Meanwhile the flee

route back they are , stealing cattle,
liberated at the first word of the Ger

Because of deprivations and the
roaming of the muddy, cold Rouman

among these miserable refugees has
been very high.
In Alexandria the ' plundering
