"Kansans Think Too Much of
Themselves!"
Mien of Wichita, urged the
holding of a constitutional convention
in Kansas in an address delivered be
fore the Topeka Itotary club at Pel
letiers Tea Room this noon. His ad
dress tore to pieces the celebrated
complacency of Kansas people in
themselves and their method of liv
Ins He also pleaded for a revolution
in county and .-ity government, and
Expressed hope that Topeka would
adopt the city manager plan of gov-
"Allen's address before the Rotary
club was a repetition of .- similar ad
dress that will be delivered late this
afternoon before the efficiency meet
Ins called by Governor Oepper. As
usual the Wichita orator drew round
after round of ppnlause and at the
same time he drew one of the largest
audiences ever present 1 1 a noon
luncheon of the Rotary club. Other
distinguished visitors, some of whom
spoke were Mavor Green of Kansas
Pit v. Kan.: Senator Charles K Snyder
of Leavenworth: Tom Wagstaff of Independence-
Prof. F. W. Blackmar of
Lawrence, and Rotarian Holmes of
Wichita.
Kansans. Talk Too Much.
"We Kansans have too much of a
disposition to Bull Con ourselves,"
said Allen in opening his address.
We talk too much of our sunlight,
and our high ideals while we are as
far behind in our manifestation of
good government as any state in the
country. .
"We are awkward and stupid in our
method of government. I don't think
there is much graft in Kansas, except
ing that which arises from a stupid
and awkward government."
Then Allen pleaded for a constitu
tionai convention to rebuild the sys
tem of state government entirely and
not do a haphazard Job of patchwork.
He lauehed at fear expressed that the
prohibition section would be abolished
should a new constitution be written.
He spoke of the attempt to kill the
primary law.
"If you wish it to remain and desire
that it be no longer considered a joke,
quit asking the people to vote for ev
ery petty clerk in your court house.
We must quit leaving to an uninter.
ested people the selection of experts.
"For governor. Judicial positions
and such offices, the judgment of the
people as a rule is all right. Princi
pally because such offices are attract
ive to men of intelligence. But in the
selection of clerks and experts along
other lines by vote we lose the essence
of true Democracy and are swayed
more by pity for a one-armed or one
legged candidate than we are for an
efficient official."
Allen next launched into a discus
sion of the city manager form of gov
ernment which he investigated per
sonally at Dayton. He derided a city
government that will not permit the
appointing of a police, health expert,
r.ttorney or other officer living out of
the city. The selection of experts
such as these should be taken from
the people, he declared.
Other SiK'akcrs.
Tom Wagstaff followed Henry Al
len. The Wichita man's .rguments,
coupled with his oratory, had during
the noon hour made him a convert to
the constitutional convention scheme,
Wagstaff admitted.
Prof. F. W. Blackmar 1 ad a little
fun at Henry Allen's expense.
"There isn't much left to talk about
after Henry Allen gets thru but
there's a whole lot left to do," said
the Lawrence man. Yet, he agreed
that Allen had hit the nail on the
head. One of Blaekrnar's hobbies is
to extend the term of office of state
officers from two to four years.
Mayor Green and Rotarian Holmes
of Wichita also made short addresses.
ROTARY SPOKES.
Fred Voiland used every laudatory
adjective in the dictionary in describ
ing Henry Allen before introducing
him. "Gee, wouldn't Jay House like to
hear that," a Rotarian exclaimed.
Pasteboard identification cards were
placed on hooks and taken down by
the Rotarians before luncheon. This
will be a regular custom from now on.
George Hart usually consumes the
luncheon time by reading the minutes
of the last meet. This time they
wouldn't let him do it. Every time he
started they began clapping.
Henry Allen asked for Topeka's co
operation in getting i n enabling act
thru the legislature, making it possi
ble for all cities to adopt he manager
plan of government.
More visitors were , resent at to
day's luncheon than at any previous
occasion. It was on account of the
ef'.ciency meeting in progress at the
state house.

AMERICAN HANGED
, S. Mining Man Executed on Villa's
Order at Chihuahua.
El Paso, Dec. 7. Howard Gray, an
American mining man at Parral, Chi
huahua, was killed by Villa bandits
when they entered the town on No
vember 5, according to a telegram re
ceived today by the Alvardo Mining &
Milling company. The message says
all other Americans were safe and
American property was unharmed.
Gray has a sister, a Mrs. Bowman, re
siding in Kl Paso.
A messenger who arrived from Par
ral shortly after the telegram was
made public said Gray was hanged by
order of Villa.
Another version of Gray's death is
that he was shot to death in the door
way of his home near Parral and his
body then hanged by a band of Villa
bandits from Villa's main column. Two
foreign refugees, who reached here to
day from Parral, related this story.
Rob German Consul of $50,000.
These foreigners saw Edgar Koch,
German consul in Parral, before they
left that city. He told them he was
ordered executed by Villa bandits' at
Santa Rosalia, after being robbed of
$50,000 worth of silver bars belonging
to the Alvarado Mining & Milling com
pany. The refugees also saw Theodore
Hoemuller. a German, before they left
Parral. He was reported to have
been killed together with his wife and
family. They said all other foreigners
in the Parral district were safe except
a number of Chinamen who had been
killed.
Was Villa at Chihuahua?
Washington, Dec. 7. Doubts that
Villa himself was in Chihuahua City
when the city was taken from the Car
ranza forces as was reported have
been raised by the story of a deserter
from Villa's band who says the bandit
chief directed the fighting by tele
graph from Bustillos ranch near Chi
huahua. His story was forwarded to
the war department today by the
limitary autnontles at El
Paso.

like a warship."

however, like that in the Marina case

Fall of Bucharest Again Re
veals Allies' Lack of Unity. -
France Says, "We Are Partly to
Blame for Catastrophe."
Paris, Dec. 7.- The news of the fall
of Bucharest was received here with
sorrow and mortification, altho it had
been regarded as inevitable since the
batUe of the Argechu was lost.
W6- understand perfectly;" fcays the
Petit' Journal, "what the Rumanians
are suffering for we too have suffered
the sorrows of invasion. We associate
ourselves all the more with their grief,
since we realize with bitterness of spi
rit that we are partly responsible for
the catastrophe, which was not due
entirely to the military abilities of the
enemy."
The newspapers say that the event
must be a lesson to the allies which
ought to spur them on to more rapid
and energetic action and above all to
the organized and effective use of
their common resources. The com
mentators, while "generally gloomy,
make the point that the Rumanians
having abandoned Bucharest, have
now a much shorter line which their
armies having emerged intact from
the claws of the German enveloping
movement have a good chance of
holding until the allies come to their
fall of Ploechti there appears no pos
sibility of saving the oil fields, which
is considered the worst feature of the
situation.
Some consolation is derived from
Swiss dispatches which report that
notwithstanding the German victories
in Rumania the German hundred
mark bill fell to eighty francs the
lowest price since the war on the
Zurich bourse.

Co-Operative Marketing Facili
ties Advocated Today.
ASK FOR STATE LEGISLATION
Repeal Law Providing for Use
of Liquid Quart.
Nearly 200 in Topeka for State
wide Sessions.
Members of the state horticultural
society this afternoon elected A. L.
Brooke of Topeka, as president of
the state organization. Brooke was
promoted from the vice presidency,
to which he was elected in 19 IB.
His election as president is for a
term of one year."
Kansas horticulturists are work
ing out a program to eliminate the
middle man in the handling of fruits
and berries. Speakers before the state
organization today advocated co-operative
marketing facilities and an or
ganization of fruit growers to provide
markets for the Kansas crops.
Members of the organization have
also urged the horticulturists to ask
for state legislation. One of the laws
to be sought this winter will be the
repeal of the law providing for use of
the Leslie box, or liquid quart. Kan
sas horticulturists want the dry
measure substituted for the liquid
measure in this state. The law is in
operation in a. majority of the states.

and many of the veteran fruit growers
of the state are in Topeka for the
meetings. The sessions this week are
the fiftieth annual meeting of the
state organization. Co-operation was
today the spirit most pronounced
among members of the state society
and it is probable that a committee
will be named to work out a program
that will eliminate the middle man in
the handling of fruits in this state.
"The members are strongly in fa

the last year were discussed by Prof.
George A. Dean of Manhattan. Pre
ceding the meeting today trustees
from each of the eight congressional
districts urged members of the society
to .conduct a spraying and pruning
campaign in an effort to improve the
health and development of apple
trees. Following this conference
Prof. George O. Gr- ene of Manhattan
discussed "The Spraying Schedule."
Frank Pyle of Osawatomie concluded
the morning program in a discussion
of the by-products of fruit.
Election of Officers.
Election of officers concerned the
members during the early hours of the
afternoon session. The principal at
traction for the afternoon session was
the speech of Senator H. M. Dunlap
of Savoy. Illinois. . Senator Dunlay is
I one of the largest apple growers in
i Illinois and came to Kansas to tell

MANY REFORMS ADVOCATED
Henry J. Allen Seeks More Effi
ciency in Court Houses.
Judge Ruppenthal Urges Fewer
Courts and More Justice.
Efficiency and economy students,
advocates of the one-man form of lo
cal government, leaders of judicial re
forms and boosters for varied and
sundry brands of repairs in the sys
tem of government, came to Topeka
today to attend Governor Capper's ef
ficiency meeting. More than eighty
men representing more than twenty
five towns of the state are attending
the sessions in the state house. In
vitations sent to more than 600 promi
nent business and professional men of
the state brought together many men
with many ideas, who are this after
noon seeking to agree on a program
to go to the state legislature.
Reforms in existing methods of
handling public business were ad
vanced this afternoon by men who
came to the meeting from every sec
tion of the state. A number of mem
bers of the 1917 legislature are at
tending the meeting. State efficiency
and economy committee members are
also present. In the crowd are many
prominent business and professional
men and persons who have studied
methods of handling public business.
Allen Has Keonomy Plan.
Henry J. Allen of Wichita, candi
date for governor in 1914, came to
the meeting with the" declaration that
the state thru the individual counties,
might save a million dollars a year
thru a more economical plan in the
court houses. Allen was one of the
principal speakers at the afternoon
meeting.
John L. Powell, prominent Wichita
business man, and other persons in
the meeting, advocated a more thoro
and uniform system of caring for
county business. Powell -uie a
form system of county accounting, the
rewriting of a number of laws now on
the statute books and the probable
holding of a constitutional convention.
Judge J. C. Ruppenthal of Rmsell
urged judicial reforms in the state's
effort to cut down operating expenses.
He urged the division of the state into
five judicial districts with several
judges elected in each district. Any
district judge might then hold court
in any county in the district. The
plan, he said, would facilitate the
handling of court work and cut down
expenses.
Have Too Many Courts.
"We have too many courts and too
many judges," Judge Ruppenthal de
clared. "Our judiciary is not co-ordinate,
flexible and consistent. We need
a more definite and certain justice
ai-d a cheaper justice. We should
provide for an interchange of judges
that judges in districts where there
are light dockets might be sent to
help with the work in the counties
with heavy dockets."
Criticism was also directed against
the present county ' system. He

HER CR0SS T00 HEAVY
"God Help the Poor," Writes Dis
tracted Mother.
Chicago, Dec. 7. Death was more
enticing than trying to rear a fam;ly
on $12 a week, with prices at the pres
ent level and Mrs. Anna Oram turned
on the gas and lay down to die. Neigh
bors, however, discovered her and to
day she is recovering.
Before her attempt at suicide, Mrs.
Oram prepared a budget showing how
she tried to stretch her husband's
email wage over the expenses of the
household.
"This is what it takes a week
$4 rent. $2 lunch and carfare. That
leaves1 $6 a week for light, fuel,
food, clothes, medicine and inci
dental? for husband, children and
myself. I owe about $180 on a
number of bills. 1 can only spare
$1 a week towards effacing this in
debtedness. God help the poor!
"Poor Johnny. The world won't
give us a chance at all. I know you
will do your best by the children
and forgive me. My cross is too
heavy, I can not carry it any
longer. Your ANNA."

Prosecution of War.
London. Dec. 7. The supreme
question of the hour in England to
day was whether David Lloyd-George
would succeed in forming a new cab
inet. In his way stood the bitterness
displayed by certain friends of the old
regime and yesterday's formal refusal
of other liberal party ministers to
serve under Andrew Bonar Law.
which means now also under Lloyd
George, since Law Is one of Lloyd
George's most whole-hearted sup
porters. But those familiar with the cour
age, determination, resourcefulness,
personal magnetism and good luck of
the late war minister were not enter
taining serious doults today over hi
ability to surmount these obstacles.
It was believed likely he will make a
forceful appeal to all parties patriot
ically to sink their political differ
ences in a single purpose of waging
an energetic and successful conduct
of the war.
Plenty of Good Material.
Lloyd-George has plenty of excel
lent material from which to draw hia
cabinet. Among the names which
were most prominently mentioned to
day as possible ministers were Bo
nar Law (unionist). Lord Curzon
(ufiionist), the Earl of Derby (union
ist). Lord Milner (unionist), Winston
Churchill (liberal). Lord Robert Ce
cil, blockade minister In the late cab
inet (unionist). Arthur Henderson
minister of pensions in the late cabi
net (laborite). Loj Devonport
(unionist). Sir Henry Dalzier (liberal
and Lord Reading (liberal). '
The chief difficulty which Lloyd
George faces is in lining up sufficient
fupport in commons for his ministry.
The present political complexion of
the house is unionist 287; liberal 260;
labor 37; Irish nationalist 26; O'Brien
ite 9: independent 2. ,
It is believed the new cr.binet maker
will eventually be able to enlist np
port of the labor party. In view of his
known purpose more lib.ally to rec
ognize that party's claims In the new
ministry. Only one member, Arthur
Henderson, minister of pensions was
on the Asquith coalition cahine'. rlil
lr.bor party has heretofore b:en very
antagonistic to Lloyd-George.
It is believed that the Welsh states
man will carry out to an even greaier
extent than he originally proposed the
powers of the plenary war council,
probably limiting his actual workln?
cabinet for this purnose to fiv or
members, reducing the others to mero
j heads of departments, not members of
the actual cabinet.
He's Prime Minister Now.
The new prime minister has opened
negotiations with the labor party with
a view to securing its support and co
operation. A meeting of the party was
held this morning at which regret was
expressed at the resignation of Mr. As
I mi it h as premier. It was decided,
however, to support any government
pledged vigorously to prosecute tSa
I war and in which labor was adequate-
ly represented. The opinion !a ex
! pressed that not less than three .abor
! members will be included in the cahi
I net. The labor members have been
invited to meet Mr. Lloyd-George at
I the war office to discuss the matter
