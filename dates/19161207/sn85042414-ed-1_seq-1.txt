Russians have Evacuated
Rumanian Capital, Pet
rograd Says.
TEUTONS CHECKED
BY REAR GUARDS
Rumanians Retreating Un
der Hostile Pressure—
9,000 Captured.
Paris, Dec. 7.—News of the fall of
Bucharest was received here with
sorrow and mortification, although it
had been regarded 'as inevitable since
the battle of Argechu was lost.
All newspapers say the event must
be a lesson to the allies, which ought
to spur them on to more rapid and
energetic action. And above all to or
ganize and make effective use of their
common resources.
Commentators, while generally
gloomy, make the point that the Ru
manians, having abandoned Buchar
est, now have a much shorter line,
which their armies, which emerged
Intact from the claws of the German
enveloping movement, have a good
chance of holding until the allies
come to their relief.
But it is agreed that with the fall
of Ploechtl there appears no proba
bility of saving the oil fields, which
are considered the worst features of
the situation. Some consolation Is de
rived trom the Swiss dispatches re
porting that notwithstanding German
victories in Rumania, the German 100
mark bill fell to 80 francs, the low
.est price since the war, on the Zurich
bourse.
9,000 Prisoners Taken.

On the Verdun front yesterday, the
Germans entered French trenches on
Hill 304, capturing the summit of the
height it is officially announced.
Teutons entered Russian positions
west of Lubsk, in Volhynia, another
announcement on a report from the
Russo-Gallcian front says. Five Rus
sian attacks last night to regain cap
tured ground were repulsed.
Regarding the Macedonian front,
the announcement says the Bulgari
ans repulsed an attack by the British
in the Struma sector. Near Cerna riv
er positions taken on the previous day
by Serbians were recaptured.
Russians Quit Bucharest.
Petrograd, via London, Dec. 7.'

WEEKLY BUDGET MORE
THAN INCOME, WOMAN
TRIES TO END LIFE
Chicago, Dec. 7.—Mrs. Anna Oram
decided last night that it was cheaper
to die than to live and after leaving
a note containing a budget of her
weekly expenses as compared to her
husband's weekly income of $12,

"This is what it takes a week—$4
rent $2 lunch and carfare that
leaves $6 a week for light, fuel,
clothing, food, medicine and inciden
tals for husband, children and my
self. owe about $180 on a number

6, 7:50 p. m.—Winter, cold, gray

battle fronts in its toy grasp for
more than a week now and has
temporarily checked any attempt
of either side at operations on a
large scale. There has been the
usual dally exchange of artillery
fire but the shelling has been
largely done by what mariners
would call "dead reckoning,"
A battle in the fog Is a wierdly
mysterious and uncanny .affair.
A roar, a flash of red flame and
out into the leaden mist shrieks
a shell on its intended mission of
death and destruction.
"This is where It should tell,"
remarked the gunner, as be
points to a map with a pair of

(Herald Special Service.)
Moorhead, Minn., Dec. 7.—The offi
cial inquiry into the two- auto acci
dents near Georgetown, Minn., last
night, in one of which C- G. Anderson
of Borup, Minn., and his daughter
Eda Anderson, 30, were killed, and
four being injured in the other, may
be delayed until the injured victims
are able to leave the hospital. The
bodies of the dead are held here,
while officials went to the scene of
the double tragedy to make a further
investigation and uncover, if possible,
the causes of the accidents, not ascer
tainable in the darkness last night.
Officials found the Johnson car
underneath the Bolstad machine, the
latter crashing on top of the first car
that went through Buffalo bridge onto
the ice.
The two accidents took place with
a one-hour interval. Owing to the
lack of travel along the road at this
point, neither was discovered until an
hour afterward, and then only by a
farmer who happened to be passing
the spot. Telephone communication
was soon gained with officials of Clay
county, Minnesota, at Moorhead, and
the sheriff, coroner and two under
takers hurried to the scene.
Johnson's body was found pinned
beneath his car, while that of his
daughter was discovered a short dis
tance down the river, clogged In
broken ice. The members of the
party found alive were rushed to St.
Luke's hospital at Fargo.
Olie Bolstad, Hendrum, Minn., and
Gilbert Estenson, Hendruna, Minn.,
may die.
The other injured are son of C. F.
Johnson (name unknown), Joseph
Stennes, Hendrum, Minn., Ernest Es
tenson, JHendrttm,. Minn. •.
A Rao car, containing.Bolstad, the
two Estensens and Joseph Stennes,
skidded as it took the Buffalo bridge
approach, broke through the bridge
railing and plunged the car twenty
feet to the ice below. This took place
about 9 o'clock.
.. Second Accident.
One hour later, Johnson, his son
and daughter, driving a Willys Over
land car, skidded in the same spot,
slid off the railing and crashed into
the upturned Reo. Johnson was
killed by a gash in his forehead, while
his daughter was drowned in the
water, her body being shot through
the ice.

To one only casually acquaint
ed with the noises of a battle

ment at first as to which are the
"friendly shells" going over
toward the enemy and which are
the very unfriendly visitors
coming over, to burst In a wild
destroying fury.
Visitors to the British front are

Indifference of the English.
Canadian and Australian soldiers

EntfWi Burial Party.
A striking picture in the fog
was that of a little English burial
party at a newly made grave. A
chaplain In khaki, with black
scarf thrown about his neck was
reading the service for the dead
while six Tommies stood bare
headed beside the bodies of sev
eral of their oomrades who, being
burled where they felL found a
final resting place in the ground
more hallowed to the real sol
dier than Westminster Itself.
Sadly alone and detached, the
little psxty seemed, and all the
while they reverently tolled,
cross currents of shells were
swishing and whining through
the overhanging mist in tne
strangest of requiem chants.
Oddly enough, fosgy and misty
days are generally succeeded by
beautiful star lit frosty nights and
the elearest possible atmosphere
and the guns are always heard
grumbling and barking through
the crystal darkness. With the'
coming of dawn, however, the
mists sweep In again from the
ssa and limit the batteries once
more to "firing hy the map."

NOTE
Transport for Troops and,
Therefore, Classed as
Battleship.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Germany, in
a note made public by the state de
portment today, contends that the
sioamer Arabia, sunk in the Mediter
ranean on November 6, was in reality
a transport ship for troops in the
service of the BiitJeh government,
which la to be considered as an aux
iliary worship," according to interna
tional law, and can, therefore, be
treated like a waislilp.
Germany's attitude, however, like
in the Marina case, in expressed to
he one of readiness to make amends
if it is shown that the submarine
commander violated Germany's
pledge to the United States.
It may be said that the United
States does not regard the circum
stances which the German note re
cites as showing justification for sink
ing the Arabia, without warning or as
relieving the submarine commander.
The presence of Chinese aboard is
considered of little importance, but
will be investigated. It may be stated
authoritlvely that no immediate ac
tion will be taken.

LABOR PARTY COMES DT.
Ijondon, Dec. 1,—AooorcMinr to
the Central News, the labor party
has decided to accept the Invitation
to be represented In the new gov
ernment.
London, Dec. 7.—David Lloyd
George, the new prime minister, op
ened negotiations with the labor party
with a view to recruiting Its support
and co-operation.
The meeting of the party was held
today, at which regret was expressed
at the resignation of Premier Asquith.
It was decided, however, to support
any government pledged vigorously
to prosecute the war. and in whlcb
labor adequately is represented.
The opinion was expressed that not
less than three labor members will be
included in the cabinet. Labor mem
bers have been Invited to meet Lloyd
George at the war office to discuss the
matter.
It having been decided that Lloyd
George shall undertake the formation
of the ministry, political circles are
Interested chiefly In the personnel of
the new cabinet, and the prospects of
the new premier for getting together
a combination that will have the sup
port of the house of commons. Few if
any liberal members of Asquith's cab
inet are likely to accept office under
Lloyd-George, and some unionist
members, like J. Austin Chamberlain
and Lord Robert Cecil, are likely to
stand aside. It is assumed,' however.'/
that-at the conference at Buckingham
palace they assured the new premie?
of their benevolent neutrality, thus
making his task simpler.'
Provincial liberal newspapers, like
The Manchester Guardian and The
Liverpool Post, make a plea to liber
als to give the government a fair
chance, as it is generally assumed
that it is the embodiment of British
determination to win fair.
According to one estimate. Lloyd
George believes he will be able to of
fer concessions to the nationalists
which will bring them Into power.
As far as the cabinet la concerned,
the new premier has a nucleus in A.
Bonar Law, Lord Derby, Lord Cur
zon, Sir Frederick Smith, Sir Edward
Carson, while Viscount Reading, lord
chief justice, is likely to join the
ministry.
