PACKERS MAKING GREATER

Chicago, Dec. 6. Exhaustive charts
showing the comparative trend of
prices of livestock and dressed meats
displayed at today's session of the Na
tional Conference and of Marketing
and Farm Credits were used as the
base by some delegates for the decla
ration that although the charts cor
respond to some extent, packers are
making comparatively greater profits
than cattlemen.
Many speakers insisted that the
whole industry, as proposed in the
Borland bill, should be investigated,
not as an attack on the packing in
dustry, but to discover for the cattle
men where lies the waste which some
economists .assert accounts for the ab
sence of substantial profit.

other causes on his list included wo
man suffrage by federal amendment,

popular vote and changes to make the j
constitution more easily amendable.
In addition to his programme to be
advocated, Mr. Bryan gave a promin
ent place to two things he proposes to
fight the effort to give the federal
government exclusive control over
railroad regulation and "the menace
of militarism, presented by proposals
for universal military service. 1
Speeches lauding Mr. Bryan and
particularly his work for the party
during the campaign just won were
made by many of the diners and a
letter was read from President Wil
son, with whom the former secretary
?.nd Mrs. Bryan had lunched during
the day. The president wrote:
"Will you not be kind enough to
convey my very cordial greetings to
Mr. . Bryan and to those who are as
sembled to do him honor at- the din

recent campaign no one rendered more
unselfish service than Mr. Bryan and
I am happy to know that this dinner
expresses the genuine admiration of
afl democrats for him. May I not by
this means convey to him my warm
est congratulations and best wishes
for his continued health and happi
ness "
In reviewing at length the accom
plishments of the democratic adminis

been done in one short term 'under the
leadership of a great democratic pres

equally democratic."
CARRANZA'S REPLY ON
WAY TO WASHINGTON
Indications Are That He Has Ratified
the Protocol.
Washington, Dec. 6. Unofficial in
formation today that Albert J. Pani,
who carried to General Carranza th
border protection protocol agreed to at
Atlantic Jity. was on his way back to
the United States from Mexico, was
construed at the state department as
an indication that the First Chief had
ratitied the document. The joint com
mission that- drafted the protocol ad
journed November 23 to reassemble
December 8 if Carranza's action was
favorable.
It is believed here that Mr. Pan!
cross the border at Laredo perhaps to
morrow and make a telegraphic re
port from there. If he reports the
ratification of the protocol, the com
mission will convene here Friday and
adjourn until he can reach Washing
ton. Under instructions from the mem
bers of the commission, the attaches
of both groups have spent much of
the time since the adjournment at
Atlantic City in drafting tentative pro
grammes for furthar discussion. Luis
Cabrera, chairman of the Mexican
commission, in an Interview credited
to 'him recently In a Mexico City
newspaper, referred to the subjects to
be discussed after the ratification of
the protocol as of "minor importance,"
but the programme drafted by the
American commissioners includes a
list of subjects regarded by them as
of great Importance.

12 SPEECHES IN HOUSE
Recent Pinch in Coal Supply to Re
ceive Attention as Well as the Soar
ing Cost of Foodstuffs.
Washington, Dec. 6. The federal in
vestigation of the high cost of living
began toaay to taKe definite form with
indications that it owuid be one of the
most comprehensive ever undertaken
and would extend to every section of
the United States. Not only is a
sweeping inquiry into the causes of
the soaring cost of foodstuffs contem
plated, but the recent pinch in the
coal supply and its resultant price ad
vances also probably will be made the
subject of broad investigation.
From President Wilson down, offi
cials began to cope in earnest with
the problems presented by the situa
tion. The president took under con
sideration preliminary reports, which,
with others yet to come, will form
the basis for recommendations he
may make to congress.
Dozen Speeches in House.
A dozen speeches on the subject
were made in the house and several
resolutions proposing inquiries were
introduced. These were referred to
committees without discussion, most
of them going to the interstate and
foreign commerce committee, of which
Representative Adamson, who is op
posed to embargoes, is the chairman.
Department of justice officials held
today conferences with members of
the federal trade commission and Dis
trict Attorney Anderson of Boston, in
charge of the department's investiga
tion, who is here to formulate- a de
finite plan of conducting the nation
wide inquiry.
Fifty Picked Investigators.
About fifty picked investigators of
the department's bureau of investiga
tion were reported to be at work
throughout the country gathering data
which will determine the "attorney
general's course of action.
The interstate commerce commis
sion probably will be called upon to
aid by furnishing data relative to the
shipments of foodstuffs and Mr. An
derson will confer with commission
officials before his departure. Grand
jury investigation at New Tork or
Chicago or both, of the reasons for
rising prices are said to be still un
der consideration. . .
Forming Program.
With the programme still in pro
cess of formation,-there were increas-
indications
tbat omeiais were
considering tbja.situation from , .three
angles, namely: -.
-l Determination of the actual
causes of the rapid rise in foodstuffs
and coal, whether it was due to nat
ural economic laws, to the unwarrant
ed action of -individual leaders and
producers in ; advancing prices, or
whether there exists agreements
among groups of dealers or producers
to boost prices. ...
2 -Vigorous prosecution of persons
or firms, if any. who, by violation of
existing laws, in making agreements
to raise prices of otherwise, have con
tributed to the' upward trend of
prices.
3 Enactment of legislation to rem
edy the present situation and to pre
vent-its recurrence. " - , :
Effort to Corner Coal Market.
Complaints have reached the depart
ment that coal products were ad'
vanced recently because, in large
measure, of the activities of certain
independent dealers, not heretofore in
the business, who are reported to have
contracted with the chief coal com
panies for virtually their entire unsold
output for the winter. It was charsed
that these dealers, scenting fat prof
its, had tried to corner the available
supply and thus forced un nrices.
These and other complaints under
investigation will be considered with
a view to prosecution, if warranted
under federal laws, which reauire that
the supplies in question must have
been in or for interstate commerce.

" Road's Short Term Notes.
of
Boston, Dec. 6. Minority stockhold
ers of the Boston and Main raolriad
today lost a point in their effort to

permanent when Judge Morton rtred
In the federal district court that they
wou'd not be allowed to attack the
validity of the road's $13,300,000 short

creditor-vf the road to the extent of
Jol.ooo on notes that were part of the

Counsel for the minority interests
naa previously told the court that
their case was concerned larirelv with
the question of the validity of the
snort term notes, which they contend
ed were issued during the period that
me josion ano Maine railroad was
under the illegal control of the New
York, ew Haven and-Hartford rail
road, xney asserted that the notes
were therefore invalid. Exceptions
were taken by the minority to the

THE ASQUITH CABINET HAS BEEN
OVERTHROWN
SUSPENSE IN ENGLAND
Bonar Low Declined to Undertake the
Formation' of New Ministry King
Conferred With Party Leaders.
London," Dec 6, 11
p. m. - David
Lloyd George has overthrown the
quith . cabinet and will become prime
minister himself. The new govern
ment will be coalition, like the old one,
Dut proDawy without the same meas
ure of harmonious support which at
tended the formation- of the first coal
ition government, because its birth has
created additional factional differenc
es.
Day of Suspense.
This result has emerged from an-
otherday of active and hurried par
ty conterences ana a day of intense
suspense and interest through the
country. There was a .prospect this
afternoon that the personal offices of
the king might solve the situation and
many thought that the Asquith regime
might be continued. The king called
the party leaders to Buckingham Pal
ace and conferred with them for more
than an hour. Mr. Asquith and Mr.
Lloyd George of the liberals, Mr. Bon
ar Law and Mr. Balfour of the union
ists and Mr. Henderson of the labor
party, were with the sovereign. It is
many years since a British ruler as
sembled the representatives of the dif
ferent factions face to face when they
had shown themselves unable to set
tle their differences. But no such se
rious crisis has arisen before to re
quire such action by the king.
Statesmen Depart Separately.
Whatever passed in council is held
secret, but the inference that the king
tried to arrange a conciliation ap
pears most natural. The five states
men departed separately, four in their
motor cars and the workingmen s
spokesman afoot.
Afterwards the king gave an au
dience to Mr. Bonar Law, who declin
ed to undertake the formation of a
new ministry and then to Mr. Lloyd
George, who accepted the responsibil
ity( as every one anticipated he would
if the opportunity came to him.
Government Will Be Coalition.
The official announcement tonight
that Mr. David Lloyd George had un
dertaken the task, with the co-operation
of Mr. Bonar Law, was a notifica
tion' that -the new government would
be coalition.
Any party. , government would be
ituposfiibl because, neither the unions.
ists nor the liberals have a majority
In "the ho4.e of commons: either bne
ftfiBsf TMtaefiL the" Irish Nationalists or
the laborites -to itself to command a
majority. The nationalists have re
fused to participate in the government
until home rule becomes established.
The laborites are sworn enemies to
Mr. Lloyd George because they resent
his -accusations that the" workingmen
have put their personal interests
above" the national interests at times
during the war.
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF
DEFENSE IN SESSION
President Wilson Discussed Objects
and Work With Its Members.
Washington, Dec. 6. Speaking to
members of the new National Council
of Defense, after its first session here
today. President Wilson declared the
council represented the first practical
effort to co-ordinate the military, in
dustrial and economic resources of the
nation. He added that the council
should be able to unite the forces of
the country for the victories of peace
as well as those of war. The president
discussed the objects and work of the
council informally with the members!
The meeting of the council with its
c'vilian advisory commission, marked
the inauguration of the thrd great el
ement of the natonal defense pro
gramme worked out by congress.
Secretary Baker presided over the
preliminary oganization meeting which
was attended by Secetaries Daniels,
Houston, Wilson and Redfield, mem
bers of the council and the following
advisory commissioners: Daniel Will
ard, president of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad; Samuel Gompers, pres
ident of the American Federation of
Labor; Franklin H. Martin, of Chica
go; Howard B. Coffin, of Detroit;
Bernard Baruch. of New York: Dr.
Hollis Godfrey of Philadelphia and I
Julius Rosenwald, f Chicago.
After Secretary Baker had addressed
them on the object sought by congress
in creating the organization, the whole
party went to the White House at the
president'" 'r-r!tainn. Another session
will be held tomorrow.
INVESTIGATING DEATH OF
MRS. FRED L. SMALL
Whose Husband is Charged With Her
Murder at Ossipee, N. H.
Ossipee, N. H., Dec. 6. Twenty wit
nesses were examined today by the
grand jury investigating the death of
Mrs. Frederick L- Small, whose hus
band is held in the county jail charged
with her murder. Mrs. Small's body
was found on Sept. 29 in the ashes of
her home on the shore of Lake Ossi
pee. Although the body was almost
completely charred, an examination
disclosed a bullet in the skull and evi
dences that a cord had been - bound
tightly about the neck.
The prosecuting officers charge that
Small killed his wife in order tq
obtain life insurance and that he en
deavored to conceal the crime by set
ting fire to the house. The building
was burned some hours after Small
had leftor Boston and he was in that
city the following day when he was
ontKfied of the fire and the discovery
of his wife's body. He denies knowl
edge of her .death.
The witnesses before the grand jury
today were questioned by Attorney
General James P. Tuttle, who is in
charge of the prosecution. Many of
them were residents of the , village,
men and women who had known
Small and his wife during the three
years that the Smalls had lived in the
neighborhood. -

New York. rec. 5. Positive identi-
fication of Charles H. Wax as "Oliver I
Osborne, elusive swain of a score of
young woman in this city, was made
today by eight persons. He has yet,
however, to face Miss Rae Tanzer, the
factory worker whose S250.000 breach
of promise against James W. Os
borne, a prominent attorney whom she
accused of courting her as "Oliver,"
led to a succession of legal proceedings
and revelation of a long chapter of
sentimental adventures in which "Oliv
er" played the dual role of hero and
villain. Wax has admitted it was he
who made love to Miss Tanzer.
Will Not Invite Miss Tanzer to Call.
The federal authorities who broueht
Wax here from Chicago probably will
not invite Miss Tanzer to call upon
him. They maintain that James W.
Osborne already has been vindicated
of the charge of having wooed and
won Miss Tanzer under the alias of
"Oliver." As a result of a confession
said to have beep made by Wax to
day. Assistant United States District
Attorney Roger : B. Wood announced,
the charges of perjury and extortion
against Miss Tanzer and several of her
witnesses in the breach of promise
case will be re-opened and the cases
rushed to trial.
After Miss Taker's breach of prom
ise suit was filed she was arrested on
a charge of misuse of the United States
mails in writing letters to Mr. Os
borne. At her hearing her principal
witness, who identified James W. Os
borne as the man who accompanied
her to a hotel in Plain field, N. J., was
arrested as a perjurer. He was sub
sequently tried and convicted, but the
conviction was set aside by a higher
court. Charges of . perjury also were
made against Miss Tanzer and soon
afterward she' recanted- her testimony,
saying she had deceived her lawyers.
When tne,J" charge's ""?fe preferred
against her. attorneys, MiS3 Tanzer as
serted her recantation had been false.
The case finally was made - a subject
of inquiry by the congressional com
mittee appointed to investigate the im
peachment charges aganst Ijnited
States District" Attorney H. Snowden
Mashall, who conducted the case
against Miss Tanzer and who is a
warm personal friend oi James w.
Osborne.
Greeted as a- Returned Prodigal.
Wax's identification began as a legal
proceeding but developed into a re
ception. He was greeted with all the
warmth of a returned prodigal. Aomng

Newark, N. J., Dec. 5. The hysteria
and collapse of Mrs. Margaret Beu

here on the charge of murdering her
husband in their home at Caldwell,
N. J., last July, brought the proceed
ings to a sudden adjournment today
in the midst of the summing up by
her counsel, Robert H. Carter. He
was describing graphically the bru
tality, as brought out in testimony, of
the woman's husband toward her,
which she said led her to shoot him
in self-defense.
"December has been a fateful month
for this little v-,rr.an," he said. "Ten
years ago this month she married

The persons who established the
identity of Wax as the elusive "Oliver"
to the satisfaction of the federal an-
thorities, however, were James W.
Osborne, mistaken for Wax either wit
tingly or unwittingly by Miss Tanzer. -
according to the prosecution, and Mrs.
Osborne. t hty w ere corroborated by
Edwin Willcox, Mr. Osborne's assist
ant; Mr. and Mrs. Stewart Denham, at
whose home Wax roomed; and W. S.
Kitchen, manager of the Plainfield ho
tel where Miss Tanzer alleged she
spent an afetrnoon with "Oliver."' Wax
had admitted his identity to the Os- -bornes
many months ago and then dis
appeared. Almost Instantly Recognized.
In every instance Wax was almost in
stantly recognized although he stood in '
line with newspaper reporters, pho
tographers and federal officers. In
variably Wax smiled when greeted and
shook hands warmly. - -
Wax did not recognize Kitchen '.un
til the latter recounted a conversatiail
they bad before Wax engaged a room.
Then Wax related in detail "r circum- '
stances of his visit to the hostelry and
described to the minutest detail the
hotel's interior. He also identified
his signature on the register and
wrote duplicates of the signature for
purposes of comparison. The signa
ture was one of the chief points in the
many actions that have grown out of
the case.
After the federal officer in charge
had annoucned late in the afternoon
that there would be no other visitors.
Wax's only comment was that he was
"very hungry." " On being assured" that
dinner would be ordered--forthwith he
r reporters something of his adven
tures. ..
Served in Philippines. lV
Wax told in detail . of his. military
record in the Philippines, where he
said he served three years as interp
reter to Major General Leonard Wood
during the Mihdano campaign. He re
ceived a jagged "bolo" wound on tho
left forearm and proudly, showed the
scar. He was honorably . discharged
with the rank of sergeant, he said,
and this statement was borne out by
the government officers -who had him
in charge. He boasted . of . his - ability
to speak six languages and gave an
exhibition of his linguistic attain
ments. He refused to discuss his. ro
mantic entanglements other than . to
say that he had "loved many women."
