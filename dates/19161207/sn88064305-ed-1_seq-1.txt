Fedleral Attorney Namel To
Direct Food Cost Probe.
Boston, Dec. 1-Investigations
of the high cost of living being
mnade by officials throughout the
count y will be directed by Geo.
W. Anderson, the United States
attorney for this distriol, it was
announced here today. Attorney
General Gregory, according to a
statement issued by the United
States Attorney's office, has ask
edl Mr. Anderson to take charge
of the investigations, so "that
the work may be co-ordinated
and made as effective and rapid
as possible.
"While technically the jurisdic
tion of the Departmeni of Justice
is only to deal with illegal re
straints of interstate commerce,"
the statement continues, the in
vestigation will take a rather
wide range andi all pertinent
facts and information will be
used as effectively as possible to
bring about a co-ordination be
tween government and business
forces.
"Undoubtedly other depart
ments of the government, like
the Department of Commerce,
the Federal Trade Commission
and the Interstate Commerce
Commission will have data and
views which will be of the great
est assistance in the matter.
"Of course, the department is
under no delusive notion that it
cen make short crops long, or
manufacture or repair needed
freight cars. but it does propose
to use alt power within the gov.
ernment's control to see that.in
terestate commerce moves un
clogged and unchecked by any
illegal combination in reetraint of
trade."

t This study of increase in the 1
e values of farm lands in the t
aight countries reveals the e
e- rathtier interesting fa't that fol. t
Slowing the improvement of the E
main market roads the increase a
in the selling price of tillable c
e farm lands served by the roads
' has mi;ounted to from one to three 2
n times the total cost of the im- j
provements, The increasd in
values in those instances which r
were recorded ranged from 63 t
per cent to 80 per cent in
it Spotsylvania county, Virginia; t
it from 68 to 194 in Dinwiddie r
r county, Virginia; 70 to 80 in Lee
d county, Virginia; 25 to 100 in
e Wise county, Virginia; 9 to
S114 in Franklin county, New
York; 50 to 100 in Dallas coun.
ty, Alabama; 25 to 50 in Laud
s erdale, Mississippi, and from '
50 to 100 in Manatee county, I
Florida. The estimates of in I
crease were based for the most
part upon the territory within a I
distance of one mile on eacht
2. side of the roads improved.
in Why should any reasoning
ill mind doubt that such is the effect
in of road improvement? Does it
a. have to be argued that a farm sac.
Ly cessible in winter and summer is
id worth more than a farm which
d can be reached only after a epell
1e of good weather?
r' There was a time when the re.
m moteness of a farm from its nat.
at ural market was a marked disad.
17 vantage. Remoteness now has
ss only a small relative value when
IS. the vutomobile has come to an
** nihlate distance.
Dn During the war and after the
war there will be a demand for
" increased production of every
i kind of farm product. One of
5 the essentials to such an increase
is road improvement and one of
5 the inevitable efiects the sure in.
crease of the value of the lands

should use their utmost efforts tid
see that every whit' male citizen
of the City of I3ogalnsa and Par. C
ish of Washington over the age
of 21 years pays his poll tax.
Then they would not only be as
sisting the schoole of our city and
parish, into which fund all p ll cl
taxes are paid, but the citizens m
who pay their poll taxes would
be qualifying themselves to take Ir
part in all questions that have to m
be decided by vote at the polls. ti
The school directors of Boga tl;
lusa and throughout the parish tr
ought to make a personal can- ni
vass between now and December
31st to see that every effort is
made to get the poll taxes paid. B
The schools of the city and parish di
need all the assistance they can n<
get and by the united effort on
the part of the good msn inter. i1
ested in the school work a con
siderable improvement in this in
direction could be brought about. N
The honor and privilege of citi- ai
zenship. and the pleasure in the A
power and force of a voice in the
political affairs of one's govern- C
ment gives an American a pres- n
tige which to be effective must be
utilized. A non-paying of a poll
tax withholds an influence that
might otherwise be argumnenta. tl

Six New School Buildings L
Being Built In Bogalusa. a
p
Bslusa, Washington parish,
which, in the past few years, has
grown from a small village to a c
rank among the six or eight lead- r
ing cities in the state, is not lag- "
ging back in the matter of educa- P
tion.
Six four-room schools are now f
under constructioa in the city of t
Bogalusa and plans are being t:
made for the erection of two more.
Inspector C. J. Brown of the
state department of education,
who recentjy toured Washington a
parish in the interest of school'
work, says the buildings are now
being ereeted in Bogaluse are of
a bungalow type, very attractive,
and that their style of architec
ture allows light to enter the
rooms from two sides, which is
highly commendable. A six*
room building would not allow
this.
Another advantage the smaller
buildings have over one large one
is that they may be scattered in
various sections of the city, sav.
ing much time in walk by the stu
dents. The schools of Bogalusa
at present employ 23 teachers.
J. F, Leters is superintendent of
p the Bogalusa schools, and ac
cording to MV~r. Brown he has
been ever alert and active in the
progress of them.
Agriculture is stress.d in the
Bogalusa schools. Mr. Brown
says that in that city are to be
found some of the best sehool
gardens in the state.
With the aid of the Great
Southern Lumber Company, and
two large paper mills which are
to be operated there soon, Mr.
Brown predicts a brill:ant future
for Bogalusa.-The Baton Rouge
