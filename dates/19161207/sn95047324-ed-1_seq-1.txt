SEISMIC EXPLOS
ION UNDER GULF
KILLS MANY FISH BETWEEN
BOCA GRANDE AND
MARCO
Department of Commerce, Bu
reau of Fisheries, Has Special
Representative Down State In
vestigating Cause of Recent E
normous Loss of Fish on Gulf
Coast of State Chlorine Gas
Stated to Be Cause Fish As
phyxiated By Thousands.
A seismic eruption or explosion
somewhere near the shores of
Florida in the Gulf of Mexico is
now said to have been the cause of
' the death of the tons of fish that
have lined the coast between Bo
ca Grande and Marco, a distance
of more than seventy-five miles,
some three weeks ago.
Off Boca Grande thousands of
dead fish suddenly appeared on
the shore and a few days later
they began to die in Charlotte
Harbor. No reason could be
found for this fatality that was
sending up to the crest of the wav
es mighty tarpon, huge jewhsh
and thousands of mullet and other
small fish. The people began to
be alarmed over the spectacle and
as the warm sun began to affect
the fish on the shore the scent be
came unbearable. In Boca Gran
de there were for several days a
force of twenty men employed m
burying the dead fish washed a-
shore to save the city from the of
fensive odors.
Fishermen and boating parties
oming in brought news of great
bodies of fish floating on the sur
face and swarms of flies making
life miserable for those attempting
to plow through the mas of putre
fying fish.
The alarm over the death of the
' fish became such that help was call
ed for from the shellfish commis
sioner and from the department of
the federal government in Wash
ington. Both responded at once.
T. II. Ilodghes, shellfish commis
sioner, went immediately to Boca
Grande and investigated. On his
return to this city yesterday he
gave the story.
Special Agent II. F. Taylor, of
the bureau of fisheries at Wash
ington, 1). C, has been on the
ground several days now, said Mr.
Hodges, and he has made a thor
ough examination of conditions.
He finds that the waters over a
large area have been heavily
charged with a chlorine gas that
asphyxiates fish or any other an
imal life that comes under its in
fluence. This was proven by see
ing dogs and other animals and
fisheating birds overcome when at
tempting to take fish from the wa
ters during the prevalence of the
gas.
Whole fchonls f mullet were
rendered insensible and captured
by fishermen. Fish taken in this
condition but before death and
placed in fresh water immediately
became alive and well. It was
clearly not a poison to the fish and
those who caught them while in
a comatose condition ate them
without fear and with no ill re
sults. The result of the investigation,
says Mr. Hodges.is that it seems to
be conclusive that some submarine
explosion took place off the Flor
ida shore, some earthquake below
the waters caused a fissure from
which the deadly gas was thrown
into the waters and charged the
waves with the death carrying
product. 1
Half way to Key West, says
Mr. Hodges, the dead fish were
seen, and he stated that the Roam
or plowed through great schools
of dead fish. Nothing like this
fatality has ever been known be
fore off the Florida coasts and it
is almost unparalleled in the his
tory of American fishing. Flor

How Diseases Are "Caught"
Life is a continuous struggle to
live to keep what we have. But
the old ideas fancies, they
might be call"' as to bow dis
eases are transmitted, need con
siderable region.
People still labor upder the de
lssion that infection diseases are
spread by contact with things,
while the fact is, that, infected ?n-
dividuals, not things, are the real
menace. Some arc afraid to touch
a car strap or a book that has
been used by strangers, and some,
much as they like money, insist
on having new bills, and only un
der the stress of. unavoidable cir
cumstances will they break the
rule and take what they can get.
Dr. Alvin II. Doty, formerly
health officer of the Port of New
York, has quite recently discussed
the subject, showing the foolish
ness of the dear, deluded people in
their fear that infection lurks ev
erywhere in public conveyances,
in clothing, money, rags, and car
straps and that diseases are con
veyed through and by such means.
If infectious diseases were really
conveyed by such media, one of
the best carriers imaginable would
be old rags, and a test of this the
ory would be found in the
rag markets of Alexandria, Egypt,
where the rags are largely the cast
off clothing of the natives, much
of which is gathered from the in
terior where infectious diseases
are always prevalent. Yet the
British sanitary officers have nev
er discovered infection among the
men, women and children whose
sole occupation is to handle the
rather disgusting merchandise.
In the Bureau at Washington,
where old currency is received for
redemption, infectious disease has
never occurred among the clerks
who handle it.
There must be some good reason
for such immunity and probably
it is in the fact that the germs of
infectious diseases find their most
natural habitation in the warmth
of the human body and not in in
animate objects which do not
furnish conditions favoring their
existence and activity.
It is the custom to fumigate the
room that has been occupied by a
tuberculous patient. It is a wise
precfmt;0T -et its greatest actual
benefit is the moral satisfaction
that every possible precaution has
been taken against the spread of
the disease. A careful exposure
of the bedding and other articles
used by the patient to the bright
sun and fresh air would be much
more effective than the formalde
hyde or the bath of sulphur can
dle. The resaon is that the tubercu
lar bacillus, as well as those of
most infectious diseases, dies and
loses its capacity for aggressive
harm within a short time after it
has been expelled from the mouth,
throat or lungs of the patient. It
cannot be lodged in the bedding,
on the walls or furniture and re
main for long an active menace.
It cannot remain suspended in the
air and retain its power for activ
ity, but expelled by the cough or
sneeze into the face, the mouth or
lostrils of another person, it be
comes dangerous, for it immedi
ately finds lodgement in the new
host where every condition favors
continued activity. It is i:i such
manner that the diseases of the
throat and lungs are transmitted
tuberculosis, colds, influenza
and bronchitis. And it seems that
the infected individual is the real
menace to his fellows man is
man's worst enemy when it comes
to the transmission of infectious
diseases.
Another class of infection, such
as malaria, and yellow fever, is
carried by the mosquito and these
insect pests become dangerous.
But they can be themselves infect
ed only by and from the human
hdst, and again the infected man
is the enemy to his fellow man.
The milleninium is pictured in
imagination as a time when the
dangers that now threaten and
disturb the morals and happiness
ot mortals will be reduced to an
inappreciable minimum. In health
matters it will be the time when
diseases, especially infectious dis
eases, will be banished, and there-
tore cannot be spread, and the
fight for health will be a thing of
the past. It is no idle dream that
such diseases may be banished, for
already typhoid has been limited
and diminished so successfully
that the prospect that it may be
come a rare disease within the
next few decades is most promis
ing, and it is at least imaginable
that other human ailments may be
conquered to the same degree and
by similar methods. State Board

FLORIDA IS THE
OPPORTUNITY IN
(By James
Florida is the greatest field of
land opportunity in the United
States today for the man of indus
try and initiative. With 33,000,000
acres of land, about two per cent
of which is cultivated, and with a
population of about 900,000, it of
fers a great field of cheap land for
the farmer and the hme-seekef
The average man looks upon
Florida as a vast wilderness of low
lands and swamps, with no other
industries than lumber, turpen
tine and orange groves. Yet this
year it is estimated that the corn
crop of Florida will exceed by
more than a million dollars the
value of the orange and grapefruit
yield.
This is indicative of the trend
of development in Florida. , For
many years the land development
companies have ben selling their
land in ten acre plots and tens of
thousands all over the United Stat
es have purchased these small
tracts.
In our own development in Put
nam and Marion counties more
than three thousand such tracts
have been sold and most of these
buyers are anxiously waiting the
day when they can come to Flori
da and take up their residence
there. These people will not be
long in the state when they will
want to buy more land to extend
their farmiing operations along
the line of general farming and
stock raising.
In this connection I want to say
that in the next few years Flor
ida will be recognized as one of
the greatest live stock states in the
Union. Anyone who has kept up
with the trend of events knows
the tremendous demands that the
necessities of the' European war
have made upon the live stock in
dustry of the world, knows that
the production of pork and beef
offers a most inviting field for
profitable investment.
Florida, with its mild winters,
its natural pasturage all the year
round, its abundance of good wa
ter, and its growing season of
from 300 to 365 days a year, pos
sesses advantages for live stock
raising that no other state oan e
qual. The lumber and turpentine in
terests and other large land-owning
concerns recognize this fact
and are preparing to fcrfce their
land and raise live stock or lease
the pastures These interests that
for so long Vked upon land as
merely a by-product have been a
wakened to the fact that their
land is now a valuable asset or a
serious liability according to the
use to which they put it.
The progress of the state is so
rapid that they cannot let it lie
idle any longer. With $12,000,
000 worth of bonds floated in the
last year for good roads, principal
and interest on which must ' be
met, with many more millions of
dollars going into new school
houses, and other public build
ings, the man who .owns large
tracts of land must turn it into
profitable use or lose it.
Recognizing this fact, the lum
ber and turpentine interests have
combined under the name of the
Cattle Tick Eradication committee
of the Southern Settlement and
Development Organization, and
have assessed themselves on an
acreage basis to raise a fund of
$60,000 a year to carry on a cam
paign of education to arouse pub
lic opinion to the necessity of pas
sing laws to rid the state of the
cattle tick, an insect something
like the sheep tick, that sucks the
life blood of the cattle and keeps
it stunted. This campaign is be
ing so vigorously conducted that
already immense ranches are be
ing fenced in and improved stock
is being brought into the state.
Near Palatka, a local lumber
company combined with Western
capital have fenced in 60,000 acres
of land on which they have 5,000
head of cattle. They have 3,000
acres in corn and velvet beans
on which they will fatten the cat
tle for market. Aside from this
they depend entirely upon the na
tural pasture for about 9 months
of the year to keep the cattle. No
LAND OF GREATEST
THE UNITED STATES

shelter is needed, owing to the
mild winters.
The Armour Company of Chi
cago, recognize the trend of events
in Florida and have built at Jack
sonville a big packing plant with
capacity for about 15.000 hogs a
week and from 300 to 500 head of
cattle, and a like number of
sheep.
But it is not alone in agricultur
al lines that Florida is progress
ing. Her cities are wonderful
hives if industry and are among
the fastest growing cities in the
country.
Tampa, for instance, has recent
ly become the seventh port of im
portance in the United States. Mi
ami, that .eighteen years ago was a
sand, dune, is today a magic city
of 20,000 inhabitants. Aladdin
with his wonderful lamp never
dreamed of accomplishing such a
wonderful transformation m so
short a time as has taken place in
Miami. "Miami is the favorite
town of many Western million
aires, and they are building pal
aces upon the seashore of great
splendor and beauty.
It was published in the local pa
pers of Florida last spring that
Mr. Burrows, of rustless screen
fame, of Brooklyn, who purchased
a corner property in Miami for
$55,000 a few years ago, has re
fused $110,000 for it and stated
that it was not for sale.
Orlando, Daytona, St. Peters
burg, Key West, all the towns a
long the Atlantic Coast and the
Gulf, are growing wonderfully,
and behind them the back country
is developing in a substantial way
that insures their growth and
prosperity. "
The tourist season is a splendid
tonic in promoting the growth of
the state, but it is the army of
newcomers that settle on the farms
every year that supply the bono
and sinew for this growth.
This army of home-seekers is in
creasing every year and will show
a remarkblo increase in the next
few years because of the . wide
spread cooperative movement in
Honda to advertise the state's
advantages and to develop its re
Sources.
A notable movement along these
lines is the Florida First adver
tising campaign, in which many of
the cities and counties are partic
ipating through their boards of
trade and otlftr local organiza
tions. Funds are raised by asses
sing a levy of 10 cents per capita
of each' community contributing
and the little towns get the same
benefits from the advertising as
the large cities. . i
The Southern , Settlement )md
Development Organization under
the direction of Clement S. Ucker
and R. M. Pindell, vice-president,
is doing splendid work for Flor
ida and the South generally.
The great trunk lino railroads of
the South are also powerful fac
tors in building up Florida.
It is a noticeable fact that Flor
ida's great opportunities for the
profitable investment of capital
are more appreciated in the West
than in the East. The bond
houses of the West have purchas
ed most of the public improve
ment bonds of Florida though
the local banks are now becoming
active competitors for these se
curities, as the Florida banks
are beginning to pile up with cap
ital.
Florida mortgages paying 8 per
cent interest on fifty per cent val
uation are among the best invest
ments, and it'-, surprising that
Eastern capital has not yet enter
ed this field. These securities are
among the best investments in the
country, as the day of cheap land
m Florida is passing and volues
are increasing very rapidly.

City Bulletin and Building News.
Call It By the Indian Name
The Indian name of the roman
tic creek just south of town is Al
pattahatchee, which means Alliga
tor creek. It is so much more
euphonious than the English name
that it is suggested that it be a-
dopted and used instead of the
English. On the original govern
ment maps, the name appears as
Apattahatchec. The suggestion
that this Indian name be used is
a good one and we hope to see it
adopted, especially as there arc in
South Florida . several other
streams that are known by the
name of Alligator creek. One of
these is not far from here; it emp
ties into Lemon Bay.
Movie Picture Etiquette
Perhaps many of those who ha
bitually attend the movies think
that because there is no spoken
word coming from the screen, con
versation does not annoy others in
the audience, if that is what ' a
crowd at a picture show can be
called.
But, all the same, it is a gross
violation of the proprieties for at
tendants to carry on a lively con
versation during the course of the
entertainment. It distracts the at
tention of those who desire to fol
low the story in all its variations
and incidents and makes the hour
an unpleasant one instead of what
it ought to be, a real pleasure.
It is probable that th3 talkers
in a movie theater do not realize
just how much of an annoyance
they are, and if the management
could, in some way, possibly by a
simple request on the screen, call
attention to the desirability of si
lence, the nuisance could be very
much abated.
Then, again, there are those
who seem, in some way to have
t bsorbed the idea that those a
round them cannot read the run
ning text occasionally flashed up
on the screen to give the necessary
clues to the action. If such peo
ple would just think a moment
that it is not at all necessary to
inform those around them what
the inscription says, for as a mat
ter of fact, it is very probable that
every movie attendant over seven
years of age can read, and those
under that age can get along with-
out the information so freely giv
en by those who read audibly the
wording of the scenarios ,
There is a movie picture show
etiquette that ought to be follow
ed just as we follow the dictates
of good taste in other things. Mi
