POLITICAL BATTLE
Attempt Being Made To Over
throw Ministry Headed by
Terauchi
Tokio, N'ov. 20. (By mail) Charges
that Field Marshal Count Terauchi is
"an unconstitutional premier" are be
ing hurled by Viscount Kato and his
followers who are promoting a move
ment to overthrow the new head of the
Pnpanese government. The auti-gov-ernmcut
campaign is expected to reach
a climax when the imperial diet con
venes December 25 and a series of stor
my sessions is expected.
Kato, former foreign minister, was
rejected by the Oeiwo (elder statesmen)
for premier at tho time Terauchi -was
cnosen, lie is lender or the kensuikai,
strongest political group in the house
of representatives.
iiis campaign was launched in a re
cent speech at IScndui when he nttacked
the Genro ns old men whose ideas dm
not change to suit changed conditions.
He asserted that PrUice Vainaguta,
head of the Genro and "spiritual rath
er of the Toxnuchi ministry" had told
him:
"1 know you are a fit person to. bo
come premier and sooner or later you
will. But today is not the time, because
tho close of tho Kuiopenu war will
bring about unexpected chauges in the
world situation. Issues that may involve
the rise or fall of our empire uiny bo
the outgrowth of the conflict. Count
Terauchi has no party connections S'-il
therefore no political enemies. That is
why he was chosen to head the new
ministry."
.This throws an interesting sidelight
on the final selection of Terauchi, af
ter it was generally expected Kato
would bo chosen premier.

STEAMER ARABIA
IS CONSIDERED
-TROOP TRANSPORT
Germany Frankly Admits,
Sinking, and Gives the
Reasons
WAS NOT ON ROUTE USED
BY PASSENGER STEAMERS
At Same Time Will Make
Amends for a Regrettable
Mistake
By Carl D. Groat,
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 7. Germany set up
the contention that the steamer Arabia
was a troop transport and admitted she
had sunk it under that impression, in 1
her answer to American inquiries mnde
public by the state department today.
At the -same time Germany agreed to
"promptly draw appropriate conse-j
quences" if the United States showed!
the vessel was an ordinary passenger
liner rather than a transport.
The text of the message said the fol
lowing results were shown by the Ger
man investigation;
"On the morning of November 6, the
German submarine encountered a large
steamer coming from the Cergi straits,
100 nautical miles west of the Island of
Cerigo.
"The steamer was painted black and
had black superstructure and not, as
is otherwise tho case with the P. & O.
line superstructure in light color.
.. "The steamer which wns identical
with the Arabia was not traveling on
the route regulnrly used by the passen
ger steamers between Port Said and
Malta, as is made plain on the enclosed
map, but was taking a zig-zag course
toward the west 120 nautical miles
north of that course, this course in
which the submarine had passed three
similar steamers nt the same snot on the
same morning, lends from the Aegeun
to Malta, so that the Arabia was mov
ing on the Pnrigo-.Malta transport route
used solely for war purposes, according
to the experiences until now.
"The commander of the submarine
further' ascertained that there were
large numbers of Chinese and other col
ored persons in their national costume
on board tho steamer; he considered
them to be workmen soldiers such ns
are used in great numbers behind tho
front by the enemies of Germany. .In
spi.e of the clear weather a"ni careful
observation the commander did not per
ceive any women and children.
"In these circumstnnres, the com
mander of the submarine wns convinced
that in the ease of this steamer he was

Many Children Die.
Because of derivations and the roam
ing (if the muddy, cold Ituuinaian roads,
the mortality of children among these
miserable refugees has been very high.
In Alexandria the plundering henched
such a height that a few educated fam
ilies which remained behind formed a
civilian force to protect their property.
These are few of the conditions which
face the new governor-general, Von
Tulff. Not onlv will he seek to restore
order, but it is tilso his task to organize
the forwarding to Germany of the vast
surplus stores of grain, cuttle and petro-
ileum which nave tiil'en into tno invnd
ers' hands. Alexandria alone posseses
a million dollars worth of stores. Other
cities ure almost equally well stocked.

AGIST USE OF THUGS
IN LABORDISPUTES
Labor Commissioner Says
Their Use Is a Menace
to Nation
Washington, Doc. 7. Marshaling of
"armod thugs to quell labor disputes"
was denounced as a menace to the na
tion' industrial peace and prosperity,
in thoreport of the department of labor
submitted to congress today.
If local and state forces cannot cope
with strike outrages, call in the federal
government, advised the report.
Labor organization is indespensauic
to attainment of economie independence
the report said. Secretary Wilson ex
pressed satisfaction over the "general
disposition of employers to recognize
workmen's right to bargain collectively
for better wages." lie said investiga
tion proves that fair relations are main
tained under such circumstances and
thnt unionization of laborers hastened
to raise the standards of citizenship.
Tho report emphasized tho good ro
sults that havo been accomplished
through mediation in settlement of ln
bor disputes. The report cites 115 cases
out of 103 controversies being Bolved
by medintion during the past year.
Secretary Wilson panned out tne de
fects in our naturalization laws which
allows orientuls in the United States
to have the privileges of citizenship
despite tho fact that their fumilics and
interests are ubroad, while foreign Horn
mon who cherish Ainericnn principles
are barred from citizenship because of
accident of birth, lie scored state laws
which permit aliens to vote for major
ity of offices in some states at'fer only
two years of residence.
Tho secretary urges public homestead
lands bo denlt out to men out of work
and renews his recommendutinn that a

El Paso, Texas, Dec. 7 Howard Gray,
an American employe of the Alvsuado.
Mining company, was tortured nnd

when tho bandits entered - Parral a

While the two mining men were) tell

in the offices of the Alvarado company
here, a telegram from the native fore
man of the company's mines at Parral
reached the'officc. The message cud:
"Everything safe except Gray. He is
dead " .Mining company officials ac
cepted it as authentic and aa corrobor
ating tho refugees' story.
Oray was acting foreman of tho Am
erican owned Alvarado properties. Fonr
of the Alvarado employes escaped be
fore the attack npon Parral and escaped
across, tho Hierras. Gray, with about
six other Americans, vtayed behind. It
was inferred from the telegram that tho
other Americans wero safe.
The two mining men who Tracked
here today wero Hpanish refugees, from
Parral, who crossed the continental di

cnust of Mexico. Word of tho death of
Oray was the first information obtained
of him since Villa entered Parral in

Villistos were still in possession of
Parrnl a woek ago when the Hporish
refugees left there, a garrison ot sev
eral hundred bandits under Colonel Be

evacuated since, it was indicated by the
telegram received today from Psrrul,
dated yesterduy. . The message also
brought news of the safety of the two
Germans, Koch and Hoemuller.
"Gray wns at a ranch house a few
miles outside Parral," the refugee told
mining members. "He wns eating sup
per when a hand of Villistos sent to
get him approached and rapped on tho
door. As he opened the door a olley

was still life, so the bandits took tho
