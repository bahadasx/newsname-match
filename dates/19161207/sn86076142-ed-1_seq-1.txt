about 60,000 square miles of Ruma

the kingdom, running from the Tran

tal to the Danube south of it, and a
large part of Dobrudja.
Simultaneously with the announce

the news of the capture ot Pleetchi,

COURT APf IRrlS
RIGHTTO MOTET
At a meeting of miners ot the
Tonopah district held last night at
Musicians' hall It was decided to sub
mit the question of a strike to a
referendum vote to be taken tomor
row between 10 a. m. and 7 p. m.
The vote will be by socret ballot and
the only credentials required will be
the presentation of a hospital card
or identification as a mine worker.
The resolution was adopted after
reading a letter from the Mine Oper
ators' association, in which the oper
ators declined to concede an advance
of 60 cents a day flat without regard
to the Mice of silver. The letter of
the operators is contained in the fol
lowing communication, received this
morning by the Bonanza:
To the Editor of the Bonanza:
Owing to wrong impression made by
article published In this - morning's
paper In regard to wage question In
the Tonopah district, the reply of the
operators to the joint committee of
the unions is quoted In full herewith
"On November 25th the com
panies represented by the Tono
pah Mine Operators' association
posed notices on their respective
properties announcing that after
December 1st and until further
notice a bonus of 60 cents per
eight hour shift would be paid to
workers In the Tonopah district
so long as the monthly New
York market price of silver for
the previous month is above 70
cents per ounce.
"On the evening of November
29th, your joint committee called
upon this association and re
quested that this increase be
made without regard to price of
silver and that time and one
half be paid for overtime.
,"The operators as represented
by this association have con
sidered your request from every
angle, but find that they are
unable to change their decision
as contained In notice posted
November 25th and reading as '
follows:
"'Effective until further notice,
and beginning December 1st,
1916, and only so long thereafter
as the average monthly New
York market price of silver for
the previous month as shown by
the Engineering , and Mining
Journal shall be above 70 cents
per ounce, a bonus of 50 cents
per shift of eight hours over the
present wage scale will be paid
to workmen of this company.
"'As an Illustration, if the av
erage monthly price ot silver tor
November, 1916, Is above 70 cents
' per ounce, all work performed
during the month of December,
1916, will be paid for at the in
creased rate.
' "'Any work performed in the
month of January, 1917, will be
governed by the average price of
silver for December, 1916, etc.,
etc.'
"Your request for overtime will
be granted, with the following
modification:
"If the overtime worked
. amounts to more than four
hours, the total overtime will be
paid for at the rate of time and
one-half. If the overtime worked
is four hours or under, the over
time will be paid for at the same
rate as the regular time."
The clause In the morning paper,
stating the bonus of 50 cents where
silver is over 70 cents Is not payable
unless five shifts or more have been
I worked," Is in error and has never
been a part of the official notice as
agreed upon among the operators. In
one or two Instances this provision
was Included in notices posted, but
abandoned as soon as it was called
to the attention of, this association.

CHICAGO, Dec. 7. The right of
the members of the trl-city central
trades council of East St. Louis to
picket the plant of the American
Steel foundries was upheld by the
United States circuit court of apealsl
in a decision reversing the United
States district court. The lower court
was directed to modify its decree en
joining picketing and to enter in
accordance with the ruling of the
upper court.
"The right to strike for higher
wages and improved conditions of
labor Is too firmly established to
necessitate further elucidation," the
decision said.
"In the pursuit of a lawful purpose
to secure a raise in wages, picketing
may be employed, as this court has
held, to ascertain whom the late em
ployer has persuaded or attempted
to persuade to accept employment
and persuasion may be made to in
duce them to quit or refuse employ
ment. "Undoubtedly picketing or persua
sion would interfere with the plain
tiff's conduct of its business in mak
ing it more difficult for them to
retain old employes and hire new
ones. Indeed, the very act of strik
ing often seriously interferes with
that free and unrestrained control
ot the employers business. But the
lawfulness of the strike Is not to be
tested by such Incidental effect of it.
"The order in the present case
falls to recognize this difference be
tween the lawful . means ot Interfer
ing with another's business an
Incident to the party's own right and
unlawful means adopted by the same
party.
"Methods may be considered law
ful, even though the employers' busi
ness is interfered with because such
methods are incidental to the right
of the employe, which right should be
and is recognized ag equal to the
right of the employer."
The decision was handed down by
Justices Mack, Alschuler and Evans.
