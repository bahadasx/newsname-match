GOMPERS DEFIES RAILROADS
IN BEHALF OF FEDERATION
isallimorc.—In )I most radical
speech lie has ever made, Samuel
(lOiupcrs, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, at the
meeting of the presidents of the
lour railroad brotherhoods and.
federation leaders, threw down
the gauntlet or organized labor to
organized capital and cried, "Lay
on. Macduff, and dammed be he
who first cries hold enough."Tlien
the labor chief, overcome by tb?
frenzy into which he had worked
himself, collaspcd. For a mom
ent after Gompers had finished,
the convention was electrified and
absolutely silent. Then the 400
delegates were on their feet shorn
ing and cheering the socialises
leading the way.
Eight Billion Combine Defeated.
"We realize," said he, "that
within the last 12 months labor
has made more history than it
had made within tne last 12 years.
Whether the end is in sight no
one knows. An $8,000,000. com
bine has been organized to fight
us. However, what of it? Orga
nized labor is here to stay. It
is a power to be reckoned with.
We don't fear the opposition: that
is. we don't fear opposition from
the outside. Our only fear is
that we shall fall to pieces be
cause of disorganization within
our ranks. For this reason the
persecution that we must suffer
is a good thing. If makes us for
get our little differences and com
bine for our common good.
"T am not alarmed over whether
the eight hour law will so into ef
fect on Jan. 1st. I am not
alarmed over the injunction pro
ceedings.
Professes Confidence in Wilson
".We do no! ask the president
or coneress for the eight-liour
law. It would have been more
satisfactory for our organizations
if we had fought it out. We
have got the law and we are going
to abide by I he law. tho capital re
cognizes no law but itself. We
have confidence enough in the
man who sits in the White House
to believe that he knows what he
wants Tiow, and that he is going
to have what lie said he wanted
before election.
Carter Attacks Newspapers
Chief Carter of the firemen's
brotherhood, in his address, de
nounced the newspapers of the
country for what he called their
subordination to the master class
es. under which classes, he said,
they had been placed by the pen
ny paper, which, lie declared,
makes independence impossible.
"When we began our tight for
an eight-hour." lie said, "the rail
road- began one of the greatest
advertising campaigns the coun
try ever knew. They used M.Otin
dailies and i.000 weeklies spend
ing. I believe, many millions of
dollars. The re-ult of the puh
"licity win that the first poop!•
'converted' were the editors ot' 'he
.newspapers. I don't even in

agers gave the editors tips as to
which ide their bread was l«uIi•
ed on. inil I J'i say thai before the
advertising campaign litorial
opinion in America generally was
with the brotherhoods.
"After the campaign llr* edi
torial columns of To per ce.nf of
the press of the country were
tilled with criticism, abuse and
misrepresentation of the broih"r
fioods. The condition of llie press
in this country is -uch that -even
the jiresidi'.MI of our land is cruci
tieii |iy the socalli'd free press uti
les ii" iiows to tli' will of Wall
street."
Gompers Trembles With Emotion
livery eye turned to (iompers as
he arose to i"s-|..n:| to |ho chiefs
of the brotherhoods. ](,. w..s
laboring under intense emotion.
His voce and lii-: body trembled.
"Men of the railroad brother
hoods." he began turning io the
four presidents, "we of llv Amer
ican federal ion of Labor expect
that-on flic 1st day of January cv
erv man in the railroad brother
hoods will inaugurate the eigld
hour workday. Whatever may
arise, whatever betide, you will
have behind you the unqualified
support of every man and woman
in organized labor as represented
hv the American Federation of.
Labor.
"When the money power of the
United States bad failed, as it fail
ed in the last election, to corrupt
nnd mislead the electorate, when
its ends were frustrated by the
American citizenship at the ballot
box, the men of capital showed
their true colors.
"They met—quite a number of
them—and p«ve to the -public the
declaration thai they would ant
agonize everv effort put forth by
organized labor, that they would
