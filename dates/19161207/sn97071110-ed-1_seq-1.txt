FRUIT SESSION
NEXT WEEK
SERIOUS PROBLEMS SURE TO ARISE
Apple Men Have Been Too Busy to Form
a Set Program for Horticultural
Society Meeting
While it is likely that the annual
meeting of the Oregon Horticultural
Society, to be held here December 11,
12.and 13, will be more lacking in a set
program than any such meeting in the
history of the organization of fruit
men, the sessions, it is predicted, will
be characterted by a pervading serious
ness. Because of the conditions sur
rounding the harvest and shipment of
the northwestern apple crop this year,
the lack of labor, the abnormally early
cold weather and the shortage of re
frigerator cars, growers of all apple
districts have never been busier than
during the past several weeks. It hap
pens that the moving spirits of the
Oregon Horticultural Society are ac
tively engaged in growing apples. This
fact accounts for the lack of prepara
tion that bas been made lor the com
ing meeting. C. O. Minton, secretary
of the organization, has been so busy
harvesting and attending to the ship
ment or his own crop or apples that he
has found the task of arranging for the
program of the approaching sessions a
difficult one.
Heretolore a large portion of the
Horticultural Society's annual sessions
has been devoted to discussion of meth
ods of cultivation. The dominating
features of the meeting of 1916 will
arise out of the difficulties that fruit
men have been facing during the past
several weeks. The car shortage prob
lem will probably come first in import
ance, and apple growers and shippers
will endeavor to devise some plan of
cooperation with railway systems to
firevent such future contingencies of a
sck of rolling Btock. Another problem
that will receive the attention of the
fruit men will be that of a lack of
wrapping paper.
At the present tune, sales agencies
of fruit districts are finding it difficult
to secure the material lor the year s
crop. 1'aper mills, it;is said, are dis
continuing in a large measure the man
ufacture of lighter weight products in
demand for wrapping apples, declaring
that the profit in making this material,
even at an advanced price, is much
less than where the stock is put into
heavier weight papers. The price of
apple wrappers, it is declared, may be
come prohibitive, and next season
Northwestern extra fancy and fancy
apples may be shipped without the
usual covering.
Visitors here during Horticultural
week will be entertained by the Com
mercial club.

south.
Mr. Ravlin says that a number of ap
plications have already been received
from prospective Portland members.
The resident membership will be limit

COTTON GOODS PRICE
ADVANCES STEADILY
The price of cotton goods is showing
a steady increase, according to dry
goods merchants. The condition in this
leading item in the dry goods business
as well as the high cost of leather
goods, is producing stunning problems
for merchants, according to U U. Hue
1st, who below seta forth some of the
reasona for the increase.
Prices on all kinda of cotton goods
are advancing and will continue to
advance for some time. The best au
thorities say there cannot possibly be a
decline before a year from now and
there it nothing to indicate a drop
then. It seems but a short while" ago
that eotton'was very low, and every
ene was urged to "buy a bale." to
keep the price up to ten centa a pound.
Now the price of raw cotton ia over 20
cents a pound and the predictiona are
that it will go to 25 cents.
The Dry Goods Economist'says :
"This last year the world's supply
of cotton was two and a quarter mil
lion bales short of the amount con
sumed. Since the production of linen
has been curtailed to a large extent,
the uae of cotton has increased accord
ingly." The Textile World Journal says:;
"The week ending June 6, 1916, there
was exported from the port of New
York alone 10,382,442 yarda of cotton
goods, valued at $1,543,127. As this
was the amount shipped out of Ibis
country in one wees and fromlone
shipping port, some idea of the magni
tude of the export of cotton goods may
be surmised.
"The supply is not equal to the de
mand nor will it be for some time to
come. This is the reason for the high
cost of cotton. As to the reason for
the supply being short, there are
many. Not the least of these is the
war, which so many people seem in
clined to belittle, though it is the most
terrible and gigantic.calamity that the
world has ever known. The effects of
the wholesale destruction that is going
on in Europe are bound to be, felt
throughout the world for some time to
come.
"Wool and leather are in much the
same position as cotton. Prices can
not help but advance and we must face
this condition and prepare foe" it in
stead of trying to explain it away or
dodge it. The old law of supply and
demand cannot be sidestepped very
easily."
SHIPPERS ADVISED
TO LOAD HEAVIER
;o f
TUESDAY VOTL
, IS VERY LIGHT
ABOUT ONE SEVENTH OF VOTE CAST
Sinclair, Walters and Cuddeford Are New
Conncilmen Exclusion Amend
ment Carries
Heavier loading of equipment to re
lieve the freight car shortage is urged
as one of the mosi effective methods of
relief by General Agent J. W. McCly
monds, of the Pacific Fruit Express Co.
"It is now up to the shipper to help
us reduce the shortage," says Mr. Mc
Clymonds. "The curriers have done
everything they possibly could to re
lieve the situation. They have run
empties in special trains from Chicago
to California. They bave even placed
special agents at all large loading and
receiving stations in an endeavor to get
cars loaded and unloaded promptly.
But they have reached their limit in
this direction now.
"A great deal of this shortage can
be avoided if shippers will load their
commodities more heavily. In many
cases, of course, they are not to blame
for shipments being loaded to the mini
mum weight, as a large number of re
ceivers of perishable commodities in
ordering a car, simply request a mini
mum car. If eastern buyers in order
ing will request shippers to furnish
them with maximum instead of mm
mum cars, the benefit will be wide
spread.
'As an example, take the spud busi
ness, the minimum weight is 30,000
pounds. Spuds in refrigerator cars can
be loaded to 35,o00 or 40,000 pounds
without damage to the shipment. If
this extra loading were indulged in,
four cars could be made to do the work
of five, or in other words, the potatoes
could be handled in one-fifth less re
frigerators than are now furnished.
"The apple people also load 30,000
minimum. Apples, which are boxed,
could very easily be loaded to 40,000
pounds or better. 1 his in handling a
crop which would take 5000 cars at a
30,000 pound minimum would enable
the carrier to move it with about 1000
less cars. The same holds true of many
other commodities stich as casabas,
sweet potatoes, celery and other veget-
bles.

Circuit Court Docket Light
After disposing of a light docket
here, Circuit Judge Brsdshaw returned
to his home at The Dalles Tuesday.
Two of the most important eases con
fronting the court were settled without
going to issue.
In the rase of Genevieve B. Dudley
vs. Frank P. Friday, both owners of
East Side orchard tracts, the conten
tions of the plaintiff, who asked that
Mr. Friday be prohibited from using a
private road across her place, were
granted without trial, in Her com
Dlaint Mrs. 'Dudley alleged that Mr.
Friday used her road and kicked up
dustlin ber face when driving.
The case of Johnson vs. The Pacific
Land Co., involving the ownership of
alleged fixtures on a West Side orchard
tract, was the other ease settlod out of
court.
A new shipment of ladies' cloaks at
rrank A. Cram a.
The vote at Tuesday's municipal elec
tion was very light. Out of an approx
imate 700 electors but 102 votes were
cast. The charter amendment, provid
ing for the exclusion of territory east
of Hood river and including the East
bide grade and steel bridge across the
river, was adopted almost unanimously.
carrying by 95 votes, yes; and seven,
no.
Some question has been raised as to
the legality of this action on the part
of the city. The exclusion, however.
by charter amendment is clearly per
missable.as was decided by the supreme
court last August in a Clatsop county
case.
Dr. H. L. Dumble was reelected
mayor, receiving 89 votes. The rest of
the ticket, as nominated at the Novem
ber primary, was elected as follows:

velopment of twoj,tine West Side orch-
ard. tracts. Dr. Dumhle also owns
city property, but his country interests
are probably heavier than the invest
ments of the city.
in. Dumble bas also found time to
make an efficient official. While be is
full of fun, he has taken his duties
seriously, and this is one of the reasons
why the people of Hood River drafted
