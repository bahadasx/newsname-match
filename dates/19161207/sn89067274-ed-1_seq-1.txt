BURLINGTON GRANTED PER
MIT FOR 35-MILE RAILROAD
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Dec. 6.
Approval of the plans of the Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy Railroad Com
pany to build a line 35 miles long
from Monroe City to Moberly was an
nounced last night by Chairman Wil
liam G. Busby, of the Public Service
Commission. A certificate of conven
ience and public necessity will be is
sued at once.
II. J. Nelson, assistant general solic
itor of tho Burlington, who was here
yesterday, said the building of this
line is part of the general scheme of
tho Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe to
enter St. Louis.
Tho Burlington and Santa Fe, he
said, will use the Monroe City-Mober-
Iy line jointly for Kansas City-Chica
go traffic over the line the Santa Fe
will build from Carrollton Mo., to
Mexico, Audrain county. This line will
intersect tho line from Monroe City
at Moberly.
In return for entrance into St. Louis
over tho Burlington line from Mexi
co, the Santa Fe will allow the joint
use of its tracks from Moberly to Car
rollton and thence into Kansas City
over its main line.
This Mr. Nelson outlined as the gen
eral plan of the two companies. The
Santa Fe plan for the Carrollton-
Mexico line has not yet been filed
with the commission, but is expected
daily.
Both lines. Nelson said, will be con
structed at once. The Burlington will
benefit by getting a much more direct
line and easier grades between Kan
sas City and Chicago and the Santa
Fe will gain an entrance into St. Lou
is that it has desired for years over a
short line from Kansas City.
From Carrollton to Mexico the now
Santa Fe line will closely parallel the
Wabash Kansas City-St. Louis line.
