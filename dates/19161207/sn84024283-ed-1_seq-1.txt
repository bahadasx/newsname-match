Beware of Making Promises.

weaken the will.. It gives a false and
transient kind of strength which Is,
essentially, wenknessA The 'men that
promise eusily are certain to bo easy
breakers of promises. But how about
people who sign a pledge or, under cir
cumstances of dire extremity, promise
to reform in some other way? There
are many ' instances where by Buch
means characters hnve been reformed
for llfe.J True, indeed, but the very ex

stimulus here. The promise lifts them
out of themselves' and enables them
to reach another plune. To stay there
requires, of course,rpcrslstbnt effort of
will extending over a long period. One
victory of Hits klnd unquestionably
leads to other victories. But the proc

promise-making which through repeat

Women's Speeches.
' 1 have never heard a woman make
a really bad speech ; on the other hand,
when I think of the men I have heard
on platforms, at dinner tables in the
pulpit a dumb feeing of despair over
takes me, especially when I think of
the sermons that are listened to every
Sunday which, Indeed, the majority
of our population refuses nowadays to
listen to. Something like 100,000. men
preach every Sunday. Many of thein
ought never to speak in public at all.
There are not, in fact, enough men
to go around. We compel tens of thou
sands of men, devoid of the gift of elo
quence, to pour themselves out two or
three times a week -to the huge detri
ment of religion, because we will not
allow an equal number of women to
use their beautiful gifts and woman's
gift of speech lias av peculiar quality
and power, a special grace, and a point
of view different from a man's. It is

Bradley Files Contest.
(Dunklin Democrat.)
Hon. Jonn H. Bradley, on last Satur
day filed papers in an election con
test with the Missouri supreme court,
at Jefferson City, setting out his right
to the office of judge of the Spring
field oourt of appeals. ,
Through an error of the county
clerk of Maries county, who placed the
name of Judge Arch Johns oh, one ot
Mr. Bradley's opponents before the
August primary, on the ticket as the
regular Democratio nominee, Instead
of Mr. Bradley, tho latter was de
prived of the vote of that connty, and
oh the face of the returns Mr. Brad
ley's opponent, Judge Argus Cox, the
Republican nominee, received a plu
rality of the votes cast.
The secretary of state issued the
certificate of election to Judge Cox,
ou tbe lace of the returns; and Mr.
Bradley is asking the supreme court
tu decide if a regular nominee of a
political party shall be deprived of an
opportunity to receive the votes of
the members of that party on account
of an error of an official to place his
name upon the ticket as the law
directs. ,
The Democratio voters ot Maries
county thought they were voting for
their party nominee, and Mr. Bradley
was that nominee; consequently is en
titled to their votes, and if he is giv
en them, he ' has a majority of ' 268
votes over Judge Cox.
It Judge Cox is allowed to take the
bench, he will certainly be em
barrassed in his efforts to deal out
justice, having been plaoed in the
position by a palpable miscarriage of
the will of the voters of the district.
Two Former Bank Officers are Indicted.
V (St. Louis Globe-Democrat.)
The federal grand jury yesterday
made publlo indictments against J. E.
Franklin and Charles S. Marsh, officers
of the Bankers' Trust Company, which
collapsed two years ago, charging
them with nlng the malls to defraud.
The Indictments were returned No
vember 18, but were not made public
until Franklin, who was president,
and Marsh, who was secretary, were
apprehended, and bond furnished.
Each man is charged in one Indict
ment with serfdjng untrue reports of
the company's oonditton through the
malls with the intention of defraud
ing prospective stockholders and In
flating the value oi stocks. The stock

dropped from $190 a Bbare to $14 just
before a receiver was asked.
The second indictment contains two
counts 'aeainst each man. The first
gives the details of an alleged trans
action in which the State Bank of
Little Rock, Ark., is said to have been
defrauded of $30,626.80, which should
have been turned over to cover notes
the bank held against V. E. Talley of
Little Rock. The indictment charges
the funds obtained on collateral
amounting to this sum were paid to
companies in which the officers of the
trust company were stockholders,
partners or sole owners. .
The second count specifies an alleged
transaction in which the trust com
pany ur.dertook to assume securities
of the State Bank of Arkansas which
had been objected to by the bank ex
aminer. These securities totaling
$218,553.31, were to be turned into
cash and available securities, the
trust company to receive $6000 com
mission for the work.
Of this amount only $175,006.67 was
turned over to the bank, it is charged,
and the trust company asked for time
on the remaining $35,516.74 on the
plea they had taken upon themselves
a heavy burden to protect the State
Bank from failure.
The story of how the Bankers' Trust
Company, organized with a capital
stock of $500,000, was inflated to the
point where the capitalization was in
creased to $2,500,000, is told in one in
dictment. According to the informa
tion In the hands of the government,
money was borrowed to pay dividends
amounting to 20 per cent annually,
which bolstered the stock to $200 per
share.
The report upon the standing of the
company and its securities were mail
ed In letters, circulars and- advertise
nients, it is charged, and on this
point, the officers will be prosecuted
through the federal statutes. '
Bond for both men was furnished
at 5 o'clock yesterday, $5000 being
asked by the government for each
man, on each Indictment makine the
bond for each $10,000.
Louis Houck and John W. McFar
land signed the bond for Franklin
and E. S. I'llsbury, Charles E. Ren

bond for Marsh. Tbey are returnable

An Ironton Interview.
Mr. Hendley Tells His Experience,'
The following brief account of an
interview with an Ironton man over
nine years ago, and its sequel, will be
read with keen interest by every
citizen.
J. Hendley, photographer, Ironton,
says: "1 was feeling run down ana

across the small of ray back. My
kidneys often acted irregularly.
When 1 beard about uoan's juaney

and got a supply at the Arcadia Val

them, I have felt no signs of back
ache or otner kidney disorder."
Mr. Hendley gave the above state
ment in December, 1906, and on July
17, 1916, he added: "I have very little

Destructive Fire at Mill Spring.
(From the Greenville Sun.)
Almost an entire block was swept
by fire at Mill Spring last Sunday
afternoon when J. H. Lucy's store
and barn, Yates and McClure's barn,
a granary belonging to Sid Leeper, F.
S. Chilton & Company's barn, an oil
house, implement sheds and other
outbuildings were destroyed.
J. H. Lucy is the only one who
carried any insurance, we.ngerstand.
His loss above the insurai pUt toV"
mated at about $1,500. Tht .loss
will aggregate several thousand dol
lars. '
The fire originated in Yates & Mc
Clure's barn. Some boys who were
playing about the barn sounded the
alarm. It is thought that the boys
were smoking and tbat some of them
dropped a lighted match, which ignit
ed the hay. The barn contained about
1,500 bushels of corn and a quantity
of hay. Mr. Lucy's barn, and that of
F. S. Chilton & Co., also contained a
considerably quantity of corn and
hay.
Mr. Lucy's was located in the old
Evans & Russell building, which has
been a Jant maifi at Mill Spring for
many years.

A very sad affair happened in Bis
marck Sunday night in the death of
Herbert M. Crocker, whose home was
near Belleview.
Mr. Crocker and two companions
drove over from Flat River Sunday
afternoon, arriving here about four
o'clock. Mr. Crocker came to call
on his financee, Miss Mabel Raba

Mr. Crocker was employed at Flat
River. He complained of not feeling
well on Saturday, although he finished
his day's work. On the way coming
over here Sunday he had a chill
Shortly after reaching the Rabadenx
home he was seized with another chill,
aud was put to bed. About six o'olock
Dr. J. L. Eaton was summoned. The
patient grew worse and complained
of having severe pains in his head.
Dr. Eaton was again called and gave
a hypodermic injection to relieve his
sufferings, after which he apparently
was resting easy. About eleven
o'clock those at the Rabadeux home
heard him breath heavily and went
to his bedside. He-died a few minutes
later. Apoplexy waa given as the
cause of bis death.
Tho deceased was 18 years, 8 months
