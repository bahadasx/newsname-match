Makes Annual Report.
Has the Northern Minnesota De
velopment association accomplished
its mission or outgrown its useful
ness?
This is a question to be decided at
the seventh annual meeting of the
association which opened in Bemidji
today for a two-day session. Nearly
150 delegates from about 19 coun
ties in Northern Minnesota are at
tending the meeting.
C. R. Middleton of Baudette, presi
dent of the organization, in his ad
dress stated that in his own judg
ment that Northern Minnesota needs*
the Northern Minnesota Develop
ment association and will need it
years to come. He urged that
the association be continued.
.s "With all that has been accom
Vp phshed through the efforts of this
association the matter of develop
ment has only fairly begun," he said.
"There are now and will continue
to be new and pressing requirements
for united effort and co-operation
and in many matters peculiar to
Northern Minnesota, and in which
other parts of the state are not so
vitally interested
Association Successful.
President Middleton pointed out
that the association was primarily
1 for the purpose ot promulgating and
^demanding ot the legislature the en
actment of a law providing for re
apportionment ot the state in order
that Northern Minnesota might have
the same voice in the enactments of
the laws of the state This was ac
complished.
Piesident Middleton in his ad
dress, said in part:
"Did the Northern Minnesota De
velopment association disband when.
ijt had accomplished reapportion
ment? No It had in its member
ship a number of men of large af
ftjflrst, men of experience and fore
sight, men who had a vision of a
^reat future for the state of Min
^^esota by the settlement and devel
opment of the millions of acres of
rich agricultural lands in Northern
Minnesota which heretofore had been
designated 'a howling wilderness'
by our friends in the southern part
of the state These men who have
been the backbone of this associa
tion saw that there was other work
for us to do, other fields to conquer,
other matters
ofo
the greates im-
portance which accomplish,t would
require united effort. These men
who are live wires in all their un
dertakings, through their counsel,
advice and influence have kept this
association alive.
"We have not only met and re
solved but we have actually gone to
(work through our officers' Standing
-committees and the individual and
undivided support of the members
and so far as was possible we have
accomplished the things we resolved
to do. More than thiswe have op
ened the eyes of other communities

All-Minnesota Club.
"The late lamented Governor W.
S. Hammond who, less than a year
before his death, when he accompa
nied the senators and representatives
from Southern Minnesota, together
with other state officers, on a trip
through the northern part of the
state, at the invitation of honored
members of this association, when
they were being entertained by the
Board of Trade and ladies of Bau
dette, conceived the idea of an 'All
State Development Association.' And
soon after his return to the capitol
at St. Paul he, as governor, issued
call for the purpose of having rep
resentative men from all parts of the
state get together and consider the
advisability of such an association,
and if deemed wise to effect its or
ganization. The result was a splen
did meeting at the capitol at St.
Paul attended by representatives
from all of the other development as
sociations and other prominent men
who, prior thereto, had interested
themselves in the development of the
state and an all-state development as
sociation was formed, and today there
is good feeling, mutual interest and
^-operation along the lines of de
lopment in the whole state of Min
~e&iota, and a disposition to pull to
gether for the improvement of all
parts of the state.
Laws Defective.
"The drainage laws of the state
are seriously defective and require

Next Session of the State
Legislature.
OUTLINES MEASURES FOR
N. M. D. A. DELEGATES
Ideas Not ah Experiment Worked
Out Very Successfully in a
Number of States.
PRISON LABOR
ON HIGHWAYS
Bill for convict labor on
highways will be introduced
at next session of legislature.
Bill was submitted at last
session but defeated in house
Convict labor is not an ex
periment.
State prison has 996 in
mates of which a portion of
429 can be used on roads.
Reformatory at St. Cloud
has 551, of which a propor
tion could be used.
Good roads induce settlers.
A bill will be submitted at the
next session of the state legislature
to provide for convict labor on high
ways, according to Senator J. H.
Baldwin of Frazee, who addressed the
Northern Minnesota Development as
sociation meeting in Bemidji this af
ternoon. The bill will be the same
as submitted at the last session, which
passed the senate with only four
negative votes, but which was de
feated in the house by a large ma
jority.
The bill which Senator Baldwin
plany to introduce is framed after the
Washington law, or very nearly, to
suit the Minnesota system in hand
ling convicts.
Not an Experiment.
"To use convict labor for the con
struction and building of public high
ways under proper restrictions is not
an experiment as it has been tried
out in a large number of states," said
Senator Baldwin in his addreste. He
explained that convict labor was be
ing used in Ohio, New Jersey, Vir
ginia, New York, Kansas, Missouri,
Colorado, Illinois, Washington and
some others and that in Washing
ton remarkable results were at
tained.
"Washington seems to have been
the pioneer in the movement," said
Senator Baldwin. "Their first law
passed was found to be almost inop
erative at the next session of the
legislatures-it was amended and tried
again and still found wanting and
it was even, if I remember correctly,
amended the second time, when later,
1913, the entire law was rebuilt and
has proven very satisfactory.
Has Bill Ready.
"The bill that I framed and sub
mitted to the legislature at the last
session and which will be the same,
or similar to the one I will sub
mit at the next session, was framed
after the Washington law, or very
nearly, to suit our system of hand
ling convicts. It is as follows:
"For an act authorizing the
working of persons being held
under sentence in the state peni
tentiary at Stillwater, and the
state reformatory in Sherburne
county, upon the construction
and improvement of highways,

URGES PROGRAM TO
MAKE LAND ACCESSIBLE
Remedy Needed to Provide Funds
Some Counties Bear Heavy
Burden of Upkeep.
George D. McCarthy of Duluth,
secretary of the Northern Minnesota
Development association, in submit
ting his annual report to the seventh
annual convention of the association
which is being held in Bemidji today,
urged a program to bring more set
tlery to this section of the state.
He urged a program that will
make land accessible through roads,
partial clearing and ditches, and to
make it productive through the ap
plication of scientific methods of ag
riculture.
For Amendment No. 1.
His complete report is as follows:
Gentlemen:
Much of the time, thought and ef
fort of your secretary in the work
of the association this year has been
devoted to Amendment No. 1 in ac
cordance with the theory adopted last
year that the amendment was the
greatest need in the orderly progress
of the development movement in
Northern Minnesota. It is gratify
ing to know that the placing of that
measure at the head of its program
by this association has not been in
vain The amendment has been
adopted by a vote that indicates that
throughout the state of Minnesota
there is a greater appreciation of the
problems of Northern Minnesota and
of the unity ot interests of all party
of the state. The vote on the amend
ment is convincing evidence -thai^The
efforts of this association in all the
years of its existence to impress up
on the other parts of the state that
Northern Minnesota is really part of
the state of Minnesota, and its prob
lems the problems of the whole state,
have been effective.
The details of the campaign will
be reported on by the committee that
conducted it. Let me call your at
tention to something that the com
mittee very likely will not. The ser
vice given by that committee is some
thing that the citizens of Northern
Minnesota should not soon forget.
Every member of it entered heart and
soul into the campaign. A large
number of meetings were held, usual
ly at the state capitol as a central
point, and the membera of the com
mittee gave up their time and their
business and paid their own expenses
to attend those meetings. Let me im
press the names upon you: Hon. P.
H. McGarry of Walker Hon. L. H.
Nord of International Falls C. R.
Middleton of Baudette, the president
of this association L. B. Arnold of
Duluth J. W. Wheeler of St. Paul
A A. D. Rahn of Minneapolis, and
John Moonan of Waseca. Hon J. A
O. Preus, state auditor, and Hon. Fred
D. Sherman, commissioner of immi
gration, met with the committee at
every meeting and gave every assist
ance to the campaign. Northern
Minnesota owes all of these ir-en a
debt it can never repay. They have
their recompense in the consciousness
of a service well performed and ef
fective in its results.
Organization and Finances.
The report of the auditing commit
tee to be submitted will show the
condition of the finances of the as
sociation at the present time and the
financial transactions of the past
year. Again it will be shown that
an undue burden falls upon some
counties because others, whose in
terests are equally great, whose bene
fits from the work of the association
are the same, do not give the asso
ciation financial support. The ex
ecutive committee has had this sub
ject under consideration. Some rem
edy undoubtedly will be found. This
is an association for Northern Min
nesota. Everything it does is de
Signed to advance the development
of this part of the state and the bene
fits that flow from its efforts cannot
be confined to the counties which
pay the small amounts requested of
them. It is possible .therefore, for
counties to obtain benefits without
paying, if they choose to adopt that
course. It would seem to be due
the association and the people In the
counties that are supporting it, that
the men in counties which have not
been paying make some provision for
raising funds.
At some time during the year I
have had the pleasure of meeting
with all of the active county devel
opment associations in the territory.
It is notable that the least difficulty
in obtaining funds for the work of
the association iS experienced in those
counties having county associations.

Caminetti in Annual Report Says
Immigration Question is Not
Solved.
ADVOCATES PROVISION
TO THE BURNETT BILL
Only 298,826 Entered Country Last
Year as Against 1,218,840
in 1914.
(By United Press)
Washington, Dec. 7.The strong
probability of a vast movement of
immigration from Western Asia to
the United States within the next
few years should demand attention
in advance, according to the annual
report of Commissioner of Immigra
tion Caminetti, sent to congress to
day. This movement was just com
mencing and was temporarily stayed
with the breaking out of war, said
the report, but is* still a question of
time when it will begin anew when
doubtlessly the history of previous
large migrations will be repeated.
Immigration from Eastern Asia,
says the report, which hs been one
of our must serious problems for years
has not yet been solved. Modifica
tions and additions to the present im
migration laws, to cope with this
Oriental invasion are urged. A pro
vision to the Burnett bill which has
already passed the house and been
reported favorably by a senate com
mittee is suggested as an ideal solu
tion.
"The fact that no person of the
Mongolian race, no matter how long
his residence here or devotion to our
country or institutions, -can*-never-
become a citizen, while a Mongolian
by the accident or birth here may
become such inspite of adherence to
the customs nd ideals of the land of
his people is an inconsistency, while
it detracts from the flignity of Am
erican citizenship," is the opinion of
the commissioner.
During the fiscal year 1914 aliens
to the number of 1,218,849 migrated
to the United States. In 1915 the
total dropped to 326,700 and in the
past year only 298,820 entered the
country. ROSS RUNNELS BUYS
