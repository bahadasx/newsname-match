(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6. The
federal Investigation of the high
cost of living began today to take
definite form with Indications
that it would extend to every sec
tion of the United States. Not
only is a sweeping inquiry into
the soaring cost of foodstuffs con
templated, but the recent pinch in
the coal supply and its resultant
price advances also will be made,
in all probability, the subject of a
broad investigation. '
Officials began to cope In ear
nest with the problems presented
by the situation. The President
took under consideration prelimi
nary reports which, with others,
will form the basis for recommen
dations he may make to congress.
Worked Up About It
A dozen speeches on the t-ubject
were made In the house and several
resolutions proposing inquiries, were
introduced. They were referred to
committees w'thout discussion, most
of them" going to the interstate and
foreign coalmen committee of which
Representative Adamson, who propos
es to embargo, is chairman.
Big Officers Confer
Department of Justice officials held
conferences today with members of
the federal trade commission and Dis
trict Attorney Anderson of Boston, in
charge of the department's investiga
tion and were to formulate a definite
plan of conducting the nation-wide inquiry-
About fifty investigators of the
department's bureau of investigation
were reported to be gathering evi
dence which will determine the de
partment's course of action.
Commission To Aid .
The interstate commerce commis
sion probably will be called upon to
recommend action and Mr. Anderson
will confer with the commission.
Grand jury investigation at New York
of the reasons for rising prices are
still under consideration. With the
program still in process of formation,
there were increasing indications that
officials were considering the situa
tion from three angles, namely:
Three Angles Probed
1. Determination of the actual
cause of the rapid rise In foodstuffs
and coal, whether it was due to nat
ural economic laws; to the unwarrant
ed action of individual dealers and
producers in advancing prices or
whether there exist agreements
among groups of dealers or produc
ers to boost prices.
Will Prosecute
2. Vigorous prosecution of persons
or firms if any. who. by violation of
existing laws in making agreements
to raise prices or otherwise, have con
tributed to the upward trend of prices.
3. Enactment of legislation to rem
edy the present situation and to pre
vent Its recurrence.
The situation is in the first of these
stages, so far as the department of
justice is concerned. With its Inves
tigators already at work, department
officials called on the federal trade
commission to cooperate and were
promised all data that the commiss
ion may have bearing on the subject
and further aid in obtaining Informp
t'on which can be acquired without
adding materially to the burdens al
ready carried by the commission.

CHICAGO, Dec 6. Delegates to the
annual session of the National Confer
ence" on Marketing and Farm Credits
devoted their time today to considera
tion "Of the packing industry as it is
related to the stock market
Debate followed the presentation of
papers treating with the raising and
marketing of livestock.
Many speakers insisted that the
whole industry, as proposed in the Bor
land bill, should be investigated, not
as an attack on the packing industry,
but to discover where lies the waste
which s'ome economists assert ac
counts for the absence of substantial
profit.
Heard Makes Talk.
V. H. Parris, of the federal trade
commission, was an attentive listener.
It is this commission which the com
mission men assert should make the
investigation. D. B. Heard, of Phoe
nix, Arizona, president of the Ameri
can National Live Stock Association,
and A. E. De Ricqles, of Denver, secre
tary of the association's market com
mittee advocated inviting the aid of
the packers in solving the problem of
the cattle men.
Mr. De Ricalea sueiresteil that nn-
ct'Uedtoufd rrSJuSSSS i
that it even might be for the good of
all concerned if the packers, who are
also the biggest wholesalers, should
go into the retail meat business.
Speakers today Included M. L. Mc-
Vure. president of the American Na-1
tional Live Stock Exchange tf Kansas
City; Moses Tomlinson, secretary of
the American Live' Stock Association,
Denver; George Andrews, commission
er of agriculture of the Missouri Paci
fic Railroad. Louis E. Burk, a ranch
man of Omaha, and E. C. Lasater, tf
Texas, said to own the largest dairy
herd In the world. Another speaker
was Henry Krumerh, of Wisconsin.
who said that the packers last sum-1
mer purchased sixty per cent of the
cheese made in his state. He said
that the packers bought cheese at 11

LONDON. Dec. 6. David Lloyd
George has overthrown the As
quith cabinet and will become
prime minister himself. The new
government will be coalition, like 1
the old one, but probably without
the same meastye of harmonious
support which attended the for
mation of first coalition govern
ment because its birth has creat
ed additional factional differenc
es. This result has emergeJ from an-
l-other day of active and hurried party
conferences and a day of intense sus
pense and interest throughout the
1 country
King Takes a Hand
There was a prospect this after
noon that the personal offices of the
king might solve the situation and
that the Asquith regime might be con
tinued. The king called the party
leaders to Buckingham Palace and
conferred with them for more than an
hour. Mr. Asquith and Mrs. Lloyd
George of the Liberal; Mr. Bonar-Law
and Mr. Balfour of the Unionists, and
Mr. Henderson of the Labor Party
were with the sovereign. It is many
years since a British ruler assembled
the representatives of the different
factions face to face when they had
shown themselves unable to settle
I their differences. But no such crisis
has before arisen to require action by
the king.
Whatever passed in council is held
secret, but the inference that the king
tried to arrange a reconciliation ap
pears a most natural one. The five
statesmen departed separately, four
in their motor cars and the working
men's spokesman afoot.
Bonar-Law Lands Job
Afterwards the king gave an audi
ence to Mr. Bonar-Law. who declined
to undertake the formation of a new
ministry, and then to Mr. Lloyd
George, who accepted the responsibil
ity, as every one anticipated he would
if the opportunity came to him.
The official announcement tonight
that Mr. Lloyd-George has undertaken
the task with the cooperation of Mr.
Bonar-Law, was a notification that the
new government would be coalition.
