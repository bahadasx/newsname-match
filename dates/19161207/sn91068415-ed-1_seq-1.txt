BOOZE AND SPEED DID THE
WORK SUNDAY
FATAL AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
Ajd Ladv Meets Death Five
Others WoundedDrunken Driver
the Cause. A Deplorable Ac
cident. One dead and five injured tells1 the
story of an automobile accident
which occurred about four miles
from High Point on the Ihomas
viile road just before the uoon hour
Sunday.
In the machine were Mrs. M. J.
Weatherman, a well known citizen
of this city living on Flint street and
who died from her injuries three
hours later. G. R. Chaoey, the
driver; Mrs. Bettie Davis and two
small sons, and Geo Clonneger, 11-year-old
grandaughter of Mrs.
Weatherman. Mrs. Dais and
Frank son seemed to have suffered
the worse of those living. All how
ever received cuts and bruises.
Chaney, who is nn employe of
the Southern Car Company, was im
mediately placed under arrest and
locked up in the city jail, awaiting
a deputy sheriff of Davidson county
who carried the prisoner to Lexing
ton to stand trial for recklessly driv
ing an automobile while in an in
toxicated condition. No bond was
allowed at the time.
The automobile party was enroute
to Lexington to visit relatives and
had engaged Chaney to drive them.
It was noticed that he was under
the influence of whiskey and twice
while going at a lightning gait on
the Thomasville road, he was asked
to slow down, but he did not pay
any attention to the warning.
The road is perfectly straight at
the point where the unfortunate ac
cident occurred with a small fill
with a culvert, and a hole of water
at one end where . Mrs. Weather
man was found. Chaney says he
was making about 25 miles an hour
at the time but he tiust have been
going near 40 as Miss Geo Cloneger
says that she had to pull her hat
brim oyer her mouth so she could
breathe; It is miraculous that all
lives were not sacrified by the
drunken ' speed king, as the car
turned complete tver. : HowegrJ
all passengers -were thrown dear to
the wreckage. The wounded and
dying were brought to the city and
given immediate attention. Mrs.
Davis collapsed when she was told
that her son Frank was probably
internally injured. The dead wo
man was 65 years of age. The re
maius were carried to Statesville
Monday for interment.
Chaney who claims that some
thing was wrong with mV car, is
said to bear a fair reputation but
that whiskey is his failing.
This is the third accident to occur
on this road recently and close to
the very place where H. M. Short of
Greensboro met death and Sidney
Allen of Winston 'seriously injured
two months ago:

The N. C. Public Service Co. ap
peared before the board and wanted
the privilege of letting contract to
fix that part of the streets occupied
by its line but as the city had al
ready contracted for all of the work,
it was thought best not to grant the
request. ;

JUDGE SPARRING FOR TIME
Judge W. M. Bond did not render
his decision in the Britt case Tues
day as promised but continued it
until Dec. 419th by which time it is
hoped to obtain an opinion from the
State Supreme court. Judge Bond's
action is rather unusual in such a
matter which in reality amounts to
an injunction against the board
which it is claimed is impossible ac
cording to court proceed ure.

Letters to Santa Claus
What to Ask For, Etc.
The Review will be glad to print
"Letters to Santa Claus" from the
little folks from week to week. It
is none too early, children, to re
mind dear old Santa of your wants
and desires because this year the
editor hears that Santy is having a
very hard time to get the usual toys
on account ot the big fight across the
pond, and that many of the various
freaks offered for sale will not be in
hand, so don't ask for too many toys!
but rather conhne yourself more
largely to useful gifts, something
that you can use or keep to remem
ber the grand old Christmas man long
after the holiday season has passed.
Of course you will want some candy
and goodies but won't a pair of mits,
stockings, handkerchiefs, coat, shoes,
hat, umbrella, rain coat, tie, dress,
aprons, gloves, ring, bracelet, belt
collar pin3, locket, pin tray, bank
account, ribbons, rocking chair,
stools, piano, tooth brush and paste,
book case, school bag, etc., be more
appreciated in the long run than
flimsy toys that are easily broken
and soon forgotteo. ?
Of course the little girl will want
a doll, tricycle or the like and the
boy a wagon or pair of skates but
in thej main we believe they will
want old Santy to bring them some
thing useful such as enumerated
above.
Now what do you think about it
children? Tell us us in your letters.

SOUTH REJOICES THAT WEST
HAS SEEN LIGHT
Washington. Dec. 6. Today a
group of Southern and Western
Democrats in 'Congress were discuss
ing the recent election when a news
paper man appeared upon the scene
and remarked that "Presieent Wilson
had thanked the West for the part
that she bad played in his election,
but said nothing about the Souths
support," whereupon Representative
Heflin, of Alabama replied Why
should the President thank the
South, for being true ,' to her Demo
cratic ideals? The South Was true
to the Mtb &xid kept the fires of
Democracy buanaiijt4Jviie;tte.'Wet
moment "had
candered off into the Republican
wilderness of sin and unbelief add
when President Wilson expressed
joy at iuc uuujiuK u cue
the Democratic household where the
South has kept and guarded the
Ark of the Democratic covenant for
a hundred years and more, he ' was
merely carrmg out the- scriptural
idea, which says, 'There is more
rejoicing in Heaven over the return
of the sheep that was lost than over
the 99 that remained safe in the
fold
'There is joy and glory enough
for the South in the realization of
the fact a maiority of the electoral
votes and a majority of the popular
vote in the States north of the Masan
and Dixon line have joined with her
in the preservation of Democratic
principles and popular government.
The Sunny South is proud of the
Golden West and the patriots of
these two sections have taught the
money lords of the Est that the
office of President is not yet a mat
ter of barter to the highest bidder."

UNUSUAL SAD BEREAVE
MENT, THIS
DOUBLE FUNERAL FATHER
AND SON

ternoon at the home of his daugh
ter, Mrs. Geo. W. Payne on English
street from pleurisy, in his 79th
year. Surviving are two sons A.
M. and L. Peace; three daughters
Mrs. Geo. Payne, Mrs Rob: Hilton

CITY GARDENING PLAN.
One way to help reduce the high cost
of living is :'or the city people to util
ize the spare ground in their back
yards, where trash and other rubbish
is now found. A small tract of land
will grow many vegetables and the sav
ing to be made will surprise you. The
children of the household can generally
do this work. Then others can raise
chickens, and those on the outskirts
hogs, etc., enough to supply the whole '
family.' This city gardening plan espe
cially is well worth trying.
OUR THANKSGIVING.
The editor and family spent a most
delightful Thanksgiying at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. David Welborn, Route

good day of it hunting and by night

bagged. The editor actually killed one
of each, missing only one shut. The
night was spent at this home and a
daylight hunt for squirrels started, but
it was too Cold for the little animals '
to venture out and all that we expe
rienced 'was cold feet and hands, fol

CHRISTMAS CHECKS
to be sent out by Home Banking
Co. the middle of December will
make nearly 5,000 people happy,
for in each family where these
checks go the direct recipient will
not alone be benefited, but each
member of the family, averaging
five to the family, and in fact, the
entire community will share in the
joys of this money circulation.
The New Year Savings Club has
been a big success this year and
will double its membership in 1917.
Each member is an enthusiastic
booster and, after learning how easy
it is to set aside a few stray pennies
each week, has acquired the saving
habit and. will not only take out
membership cards for himself, but
will bring his family and friends in
to the happy throng for next year.
Then too many have learned the
wocderful possibilities and pleasures
of Thrift and will deposit the Christ
mas checks in the. savings depart
ment of our Home Bank at 4 percent
interest.
We invite you to join our club
and get ready for your Christmas
check next year. It looks like a
small thing in the beginning, but
that big Christmas check looks good
and always comes in handy. It's
just like money picked up from the
street, except it is yours.
In addition to affording you an op
portunity to have a bank account
with ouly deposits of stray pennies
and nickles, which you never miss,
our Home Bank pays you 4 per
cent interest, and in this way, you
have' before you a proposition you
can't afford to turn down.
Call and let them explain any
feature which may not be plain and
remember you are always welcome
at the banking house of Home "Bank
ing Co., the originators of the Christ
mas Savings Club system in High
Point. (adv.)
