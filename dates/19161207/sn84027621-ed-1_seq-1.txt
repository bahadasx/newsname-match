Striking Back at Pursuing Teutons
Stubborn Rearguard Actions
rtirniiii
THAT MORE
Russian and German statements
today left little doubt that the Ru
manian armies defending Bucharest
escaped before the city was taken by
the Germans. The German opinion
was the Rumanians would evacuate
all of Wallachia, retiring to Moldavia,
where they have a materially short
ened front and will be near the Rus
sians in. Volhynia.
Berlin said the Germans captured
positions near Lutsk, holding them
against five Russian counter attacks.
In Macedonia the Bulgarians were
declared to have repulsed a British
attack and recaptured from the Ser
bians positions lost the day before.
The Germans captured the summit
of a height in the Verdun region,
Berlin announced.
RUMANIANS IN FULL RETREAT
Berlin, Dec. 7. The defeated Ru
manians are ' retreating along the
thole front, said a war office state
ment. The Teutons captured s Camp
. ino on the railroad between Kron
stadt and Ploechti. Nine thousand
Rumanian prisoners were captured
yesterday. The report also recounts
the taking of Ploechti and Sinai.
STUBBORN REARGUARD SCRAPS
Petrograd, Dec. 7. Bucharest has
been - evacuated by the Rumanians,
eaid the war office. Rumanians south
of the capital also retired. In Walla
chia the Rumanians are retreating
' toward the east under hostile pres
sure, holding the Teutons by rear
guard actions.
TAKEN BY TEUTONS
London, Dec. 7. One hundred
. thousand Rumanian prisoners have
been received at German prison camps
since Rumania entered the war, ac
cording to a Copenhagen dispatch,
quoting the Berlin Lokal Anzeiger.
"NOBODY HOME"
The St. Augustine Record says of
"Nobody Home," which was produced
at the Jefferson theater in that city
Tuesday night:
"Nobody Home," a musical comedy,
was presented at the Jefferson theater
Tuesday night. Taken as a whole
the performance, from the standpoint
,of amusement, was very pleasing, es-
fpecially the clever acting of Charles
McNaughton as Freddy Popple f Ip-
pleton, (England; Lew Christy as Ro
land d'Amorini, the artful Italian hus-
band, and charming Cecilia Nevasio
as Tony Miller, prima donna at the
"Winter Garden. The dancing numbers
proved a great hit from an artistic
sense, because the work of Mr. Hess
and Miss Bennett was fully up to the
standard of the best professional per
formers. That their dancing met with
approval was more than evident from
the repeated encores.
The orchestra carried by the com
pany is composed entirely of profes
sionals and the accompaniments were
played in excellent taste and with
splendid effect. The chorus work was
disappointing but the shortcomings
were overbalanced by the clever play
ine of the musicians. The audience
seemed to thoroughly enjoy the per
formance from start to finish.

(Associated Iress) ' ,
Washington, Dec. 7. Efficient mil
itary organization of the nation de
mands abandonment of the present
system of selecting candidates for ad
mission to the Military Academy,
Secretary Baker declares in his an
nual report, made public yesterday.
Instead df having the president and
members of Congress designate stud
ents to take the entrance examina
tions, the secretary urges that prepar
atory schools be established by the
government and graduates of. these
institutions wlu show the greatest
fitness be further trained at .West
Point or Annapolis.
"It seems likely," Mr. Baker says,
"that schools of this sort would spread
the field of selection ideally -over the
country and make the cadets at West
Point and midshipmen at Annapolis
bodies of young men selected by a
demonstration of their special apti
tude for. the pursuit of military ser
vice." Amplifying his suggestion, he adds:
"The method of selection of cadets
for West Point has for years. consist
ed of designation by the president,
senators and representatives, with ex
amination as a prerequisite to accep
tance; but we are learning daily that
a nation efficiently organized from a
military point of view must of neces
sity be efficiently organized indus
trially. We are learning also that the
ideal military preparation of any
country is one which is readily ex
panded in an emergency so as to in
clude great numbers of men in the in
dustrial and commercial life of the
nation who have had enough prelim
inary training to make them convert
able by brief additional training into
officers. Should the United States
ever be called upon to meet a great
military emergency a large army
would have to be sustained and sup
ported by a highly coordinated indus
trial system. There 'should therefore
be in the country at all times a great
body of men trained a . mechanics,
whose places in such an emergency
would be not in the ranks of the fight
ing force but at the lathes and forges
from which the ammunition supply of
the army must be drawn.
"I venture to believe that if the
federal government were to establish
in a number of places throughout the
country school preparatory to the Mil
itary Academy at West Point and the
Naval Academy at Annapolis, in
which the rudiments of a sound edu
cation, the elements of mechanical
skill, the principles of business co
ordination, and the beginnings of mil
itary science were , taught, these
schools would develop the natural
aptitudes of the studnest in such a
way as to supply those fittest by tem-

Washington, Dec. . 7. The Demo

$1803,148 and disbursed $1,684,590,
according to the final report of the

Military Academy and the Naval
Academy the study of military
science; and incidentally these schools
would furnish a great body of men
returning to civil life fitted by train
ing either to respond in an emergency
to a call to the colors or to take their
places as civil soldiers in the service
of the government in those industries
and undertakings fundamental to the
successful conduct of military opera
tions. -
"The suggestion here madeN ought
not perhaps to be further elaborated
m this report, but I think it will be
apparent that no expenditure in con
templation of a military emergency
would be more apt or helpful than one
which gave to 25,000 or 30,000 young
men the inspiration of industrial edu
cation at the hands of the govern
ment, inaoctrined them with the spirit
of service to their country, and tabu
lated them so that they would be al
ways available for either the military
or industrial service which their aca
demic experience indicated most in ac
cordance with their aptitudes." . ?
Mr. Baker calls attention to the
fact that he did not take office until
March 9, 1916, succeeding General
Scott who was secretary ad interim
after the resignation of Secretary
Garrison. He reviews briefly the his
tory of affairs on the Mexican border
beginning with the raid oa Columbus,
New Mexico, and carrying it forward
to Nov. 20th, the date of the report.
On that day, he says, there are still
110,000 officers and men of the na
tional guard on the border in addition
to approximately 48,000. members of
the regular army.
Under the sub-heading, "The Pres
ent Situation," the report continues:
"The mere presence of this enlarg
ed force has served to preserve peace
and protect life and property. Dis
turbances by outlaws and bandits in
Northern Mexico have continued and
roving bands of various numbers
have moved through the territory,
harrassing Mexican forces and raid
ing Mexican communities, but they
have not ventured an attack upon the
people of the United States. In the
meantime the militia forces on the
border have been drilled,their organ-

HOWARD GRAY, AMERICA!! CITIZEN, AT
BY VILLA'S ORDERS, VMS HOIIG
( Associated Press)
El Paso, Dec. 7. Howard Gray, an
American mining man at Parral, was
killed by Villa bandits when they en
tered that town Nov. 5th, according
to a telegram received by a mining
company here. A messenger arriving

said Gray was hanged by Villa's

ization perfected, and their personnel
accustomed to life in camp in the per
formance of this defensive duty."
The report goes at some length into
the odd situation which was presented
when the national guard was sum
moned for border 4uty. Reorganiza
tion of the forces under the national
defense act was in progress but not
completed at the time, Mr. Baker says
and many complex problems had to
be solved.
"The confusion and difficulties at
tending the mobilization," he con
tinues, "will seem insignificant in
comparison with its . success and with
the splendid spirit with which men
and officers of the. national guard re
sponded." r The secretary points out that the
duty to which the state troops were
called was the most trying a soldier
could be required to perform, lacking
the movement and enthusiasm of ac
tive military operations yet present
ing all the privations of a soldier's
life.
"It is not strange that some rest
lessness and complaint have been
heard both from an occasional mem
ber of one of the guard forces and
from their friends at home," he said.
;These complaints, however, have
been minor and infrequent. The spirit
of the regiments has been high, their
service cheerful, and their apprecia
tion both of their opportunity for
public service and of the value of the
training received by them has been
evidenced from all quarters."

the war department and for the co

Some disappointment is expressed
over the situation as to recruiting for
the army. While the number of men
accepted every month for army ser
vice has increased since last year, "it
has not been as marked an increase
as desired," the secretary says. High
wages and scarcity of labor are cited
as responsible.

Says British Liner Was Really
a Troop Ship
WILL MAKE AMENDS FOR MARINA IF SUB COMMANDER VI
OLATED HIS GOVERNMENT'S PLEDGES x
s
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 7. Germany, in
a note made public today by the state
department, contended that the Brit
ish steamer Arabia, sunk in the Med
iterranean Nov. 6th, really was a
"transport ship for troops in service
of the British government, which is
to be considered as an auxiliary war
ship, according to international law,
and therefore to be treated like a
warship."
Germany, likewise in the Marina
case,, expressed a readiness to make
amends if it be shown the submarine
commander who sank the Arabia had
violated Germany's pledged to the
United States.
WILL PROBABLY TOLERATE
THIS ONE
Secretary Lansing was silent re
garding the Arabia note. Should it
be shown that the Arabia was a
transport, the United States t will
probably admit the sinking of the
steamer .was justified. If the sub
marine commander was mistaken the
state department would face a serious
situation. When the Sussex was sunk
Germany was told this country could
not tolerate "regrettable mistakes."
METHODIST CONFERENCE
The 73rd annual conference now in
ression is largely attended and re
ports are unusually good. From every
section come accounts of large . of
ferings and great "meetings. So far
as recent reports indicate that prob
ably 5000 additions have been re
ceived to the church membership, and
that aggregate contributions to all
purposes will exceed by thousands of
needed," the report continues. "How
ever, during June, July and August,
1916, the number of enlistments - in
creased practically 175 per cent over
the corresponding months in 1915."
The report shows that on June 30,
1916, the authorized total strength of
the regular army was 5,018 v officers
and 122,693 enlisted men, an increase
of 184 officers and 25,445 men over
the preceding year. The actual
strength on that date was 4,843 offi
cers and 97,013 enlisted men, or a net
gain during the year of 227 officers
and 1,248 men.
Analyzing the national defense act
the report finds that the maximum en
listed peace strength authorized is
223,580, while the war strength would
reach a total of 298,000. The strength
of the national guard contemplated
by the bill is fixed at 17,000 officers
and 440,000 men, but the report says
nothing as to the prospect of enlist
ing enough men to fill up either ser
vice. ' . . T

It's a far cry from 1845, when for

the local church now stands, and the
whole conference boasted eleven pas

and reporting on the site of that
original purchase plot of ground.
Yesterday, the conference wa3 con- .

Hon. R. McConathy, is his' usual

on behalf of the conference.
The proceedings of the morning

The afternoon was devoted to meet

Dr. E. B. Chappell, general Sunday

It is in these boards that all vital
questions are considered and acted
