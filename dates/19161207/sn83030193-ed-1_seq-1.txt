she placed her arms akimbo and re

attempt nt levity.
"You're right," nserted Mrs. O'Con

.LONDON, Dee. ".It was rcganlnl
this afternoon ns vlrtally certain Hint
David I.loyd George would succeed In
organizing .1 Ministry which w ill have
the support of n majority In tho
Houso of Commons, the Labor Tarty
having decided to participate In 1,10
making up of tho new Cnblntt.
It Is snld that George Nlcoll Ilarne...
Labor member of Parliament for tho
Klackfrlaui Division of Glasgow and
11 Privy Councillor, and Arthur Hen
derson, President of tho Hoanl of
Kduc.itlon In the Coalition Ministry,
will bo members of the Cabinet, nu 1
that one of them will sit In tho War
Council. In . Idttloii, It Is also said,
thrco I'ndcr Secretaryships will bo
nlloted to the Labor Part)
It was stated on good authority
late to-day that Arthur J. Halfour.
First Ixird of tho Admiralty under
the coalition tegline, would be n mem
ber of the Cabinet, because otherwise
tho Unionists would refuse support
to the new Ministry.
It is understood I.loyd Goorse Is
aiming at a Cabinet of twelve mem
bers, live of them Unionists, live Lib.
em Is and two 1-ibor representatives.
From this number a small War Coun.
ell Is to be appointed.
Tho neV Premier's iiltllcully ;il
present Is to obtnln adequate Libera)
representation, Inasmuch as nearly nil
tho Liberals in Mr. Asqulth's Cabinet
nre declining to servo under him.
However, It was decided at a meeting
of Llbernl War Committee, held un
der tho chairmanship of Sir Frederick
Cawlcy, and attended by thirty mem
bers, to support the new Premier ac
tively. The Labor Parliamentary Party
has passed a resolution expressing
the hope that "In this supreme crisis
an endeavor will be made by the new
Government to settle the Irish ques
tion and bilng about the widest
measure of co-oper.iHon of all forces
nnd energies of Hie nation and He
empire,"
It has been stated that Hie new
Premier believes he will be able to
offer concessions lo tho Nationalists
which will bring them Into line. Ac.
cording to one estimate hn can rely
on tho support of virtually all the
Unionist members and of seventy
Liberals.
The present political complexion of
the Houso Is: Unionist, 2h7; Liborul,
200! Labor, 37; Irish Nationalist, 75;
O'Hricnlto, 9; Indeis-ndent, 2.
Lloyd George wus busy almost nil
morning conferlng with llon.ir Iiw,
Sir IMwajd Carson, Henderson and
others.
A meeting of all Liberals of both
Houses 0 Parliament Is scheduled
for to-morrow. Mr. Akqulth will pro.
