HOW TO BEAT HIM
A New Idea Evolved Which Will
Spell Defeat for the Coal
Man.
Uudolph Bering, a New York
expert has been lecturing over the
west on garbage and waste con
servation. A St. Joseph man
heard him at Kansas City pro
pose to gather up the ashes and
garbage in the 'same wagons and
burn them together. Forty per
cent of the heating value of. coal
remains in. the ashes taken from
the' average residence furnace.
Tiering said.
That gave a local coal man an
idea. Now, when he puts coal in
his furnace, he puts two or three
shovels of ashes on top of it. I
This makes the cnaNjburu slower,
does away with the nessity of ,
adjusting the draft and tTV ashes '
are hi;nied too. He says heinds i
that tlnve shovels lull of coal and
two of ashes will eventually burn
down to about three shovels full
of ashes. He now sorts his ashes
and does not throw any away un
til after they have been re-burned.
lie also burns bis garbage.
Wet garbage, thrown on top the
coal, gives somewhat the. same ad-
vantagc as dampening coul does.

- Prices of Eggs Come Down.
Kansas City, Alo., Dec. ;". The
price of eggs dropped seven cents
per dozen. on the local markets to
day. The commission men say
that the .warm weather' is re
sponsible for the decline, as the
hens are laying better than in
cooler weather. But it is likely
that Hie threatened boycott of the
restaurant 'men had sonieH1'""' to
do with the price, as the cold
storage, plants are filled with
eggs which a boycott . would
cause the owner's to lose big mon
cv on.
