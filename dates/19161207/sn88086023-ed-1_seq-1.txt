dying are every hundred yurdi. An
archy and ohaoa reign. The inhabi
tant' misery la terrible. Th Rou
manian government ordered civilian
to abandon their homea before the
awlft German advance and refugees
crowded roada. The wlldeat anarchy
prevailed. Village street were lit
tered with hounehold good, a pern,
window curtaina. dead horses and
doga. Gypsies smashed windows,
plundered house and looted every
thing. The refugeea ure ateallng cat
tle everywhere they are found. De
privation and the long marches on
muddy roada caused many children
to die. The rioters fired numeruus
buildings and burned furniture by the
roadside. Starving dogs devour half
dead homes while crowa pick their
eves.
General Tulff la en route here In
an attempt to restore order. The
Alexandria plundering la so severe
that a few educated families organ
ized a civilian guard to protect their
property.

vast surplus stores of grain, cattle
and plroleum conquered here. Alex

were equally well slocked. Walla-c-liiu

A a result of the Roumanians de.
stroylng the railways the entire Ger
man army used old fashioned wagons
during the advance. They carried
ammunition, food, weapons and sup
plies. The Germans are rapidly re
building the railways.
The Germans' swift advance pre
vented the Teutons from organizing
a police system in all the cities cap
tured. While breakfasting with one
family a boy exhibited a gold neck
lace, ruber boots and stocking stolen
from looted stores.
The constant barking of deserted
dogs prevents sleep. On the walla of
many ruined homes "the Invaders
found maps showing "Greater Rou

WALLA WALLA SEEKS
TO SAVE BUILDINGS
Sine lair Association Has Offered
Equipment for Sale City Is Without
PVuti to Hold Celebration.
An effort is being made in Walla
Walla to save the fair grounds and
buildings. Since the directors have
advertised for bids for the lumber In
the fences and buildings and have
announced their intention of dispos
ing of the land In order to meet ln
ebtedness, the city and county faces
the prospects of being without a place
to hold any kind of a fair celebra
tion. According to a statement given out
yesterday by two of the directors, ao
tion might be stayed by businessmen
taking up $15,000 or $20,000 worth
of bonds now in the hands of John
Ankeny, trustee, who is ready to is
sue interest-bearing bonds secured by
a flrt mortgage on the property as
soon as the present mortgage held by
James Paeres Is paid.
James Dacres has a first mortgage
against the fair grounds property for
$20,000. on which no interest has
been paid for two years. The action
of his attorneys in warning against
foreclosure proceedings, caused the
recent action of the fair directors.
Mr. Dacres Is willing to accept
bonds in payment of about $5000 of
his mortgage, and other unsecured
creditors have expressed willingness
to do likewise. The other debts of
the association Include such Items as
a $6000 lumber bill; $2500 for erec
tion of bleachers and buildings $3000
owing George Drumheller for the
first Frontier Days exhibition; big
Insurance and interest bills and oth
er funds advanced for running ex
penses; nearly $1000 printing bill,
etc.

an Vik.
WASHINGTON, Dec, 7 The state
department has made public Ger
many's answer to American Inquiries
regarding the steamer Arabia sink
ing. It contended the vessel was a
troop transport but agreed to
"promptly draw the appropriate con
sequences" If the United States prov
ed the ship was an ordinary passen
ger liner.
Explanation Regarded As Weak.
The United Press learned from of
ficial sources the government regards
the explanation as weak. The Unit
ed States has no facts to disprove
the German claim. The government
said the situation U "not essentially
delicate." Officials refused to indi
cate wather a break in diplomatic re
lations would result if Germany's
case is proved too weak.
Text of Tcply.
Th German reply said: "On the
morning of November 6th a German
submarine encountered a large
steamer on the Corgo straits a hun
dred miles west of Corlgo island. It
was not traveling the route the reg
ular steamers used between Port Said
and Malta but took a zigzag course
westerly and followed the Parigo
Malta war transport route.
'The submarine's commander as
certained thait a large number of Chi
nese and other colored persons in
national costume were aboard. He
considered them the workmen sol
iers. used in great numbers behinl
the allies' lines. Despite clear
weather' and careful observation, the
commander did not perceive any
women or children.
Beteved Vessel Transports
"The submarine's commander was
convinced the steamer was a British
transport or auxniary warship under
international law, subject to a war
ship's treatment. Accordingly he
considered he was highly Justified in
attacking the steamer with no delay
and sinking It.
"Should the American government
give official data showing the Ara
bia was an ordinary passenger steam
er, this would be a case of a regret
table mistake and Germany would
promptly draw appropriate conse
quences." Lan--? Refills Comment.
Lansing refused to comment. The
state department said privately the
Arabia was the main case for the ar
rangement of further American-German
relations.
It pointed on' that Germany had
emphasized the fact hat her subma
rine commanders were still under or
ders to obey international law, as th
United States demanded In She Sussex
note.
