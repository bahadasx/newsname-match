LONDON, Dec. 7 D having been
decided definitely that David Lloy.dGeorge
will undertake the formation
i of a new ministry, politic: 1 circles
were Thursday int. rested in the personnel
of the new cabinet and the
prospects of the new premier potting
together a combination that win have
a majority of the House of Commons.
Few, if any, of the Liberal members
of Mr. Asquith's cabinet are likely to
accept office under Mr. Lloyd-Go'orgp..
and some of the Unionist members
like Sir Austen Chamberlain and
Lord Robert Cecil are likely to stand
aside. However, it is assumed that a,r
the conference at Buckingham palace
they assured the hew premier of their
benevolent neutrality, thus making
his task much simpler.
As far as the cabinet is concerned
the new premier has a nucleus in A.
Bonar Law, Lord Derby, Lord Curzon,
Sir Frederick E. Smith and Sir
Edward Carson, while Viscount Reading
the lord chief justice, is likely to
join the ministry.
Other Liberal members may be
drawn from men such as Sir Frederick
Caw1?/, member of the ITpuso of
Commons; from the Prestwick division
of Lancashire, and. Sir George Pol
lard, member from the Ecc!<?s division
of Lancashire, who, although the
public has heard little of them, have
done efficient worL in committees.
Dr. Christopher Addison. parliamentary
under secretary for munitions.
is almost, certain to have a
place in the cabinet, and Colonel Win
stbn Spencer Chmchill, former first
lord of the admiralty, is slated for a
high office.
The new government wPl meet, the
House of Commons to learn what
manner of reception will be accorded
it. A tost of strength may be made
on a vote of credit wlpcli may be
moved immediately.
Thursday's session of the .'House of
Commons was expected to be a formal
one, it being doubtful whether
whether any of the members would
put in an appearance.
.The House of Commons adjourned ,
until Tuesday. j
A meeting of the Liberal party,!
over which .\lr. Asquith will preside,
-will be held Friday.

Germany in a Note Made Public j
Contends the Arabia Was
in Real Fact.
iot .icociatid rncis)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7?Germany,
in a note made public by the slate de- j
partmcnt. Thursday, contends that the ,
British steamer Arabia, sunk In the
Mediterranean November 6. was in
reality "a transport ship for troops in
the service or the British government,
which is to be considered :is
ah auxiliary warship, according to international
law. and can therefore be
treated like a warship."
The German government's attitude.
however, like that in the Marina
case, is expressed to be one of
readiness to make amends if it be
shown that the submarine commander
vio'ated Germany's pledge to the
United Stales.
What action the state department
will take is proloniatical.
Should it be shown that the Arabia
was. as Germany contends, a transport.
this government probably would
admit the sinking was justified.
If, however, it is shown that the
submarine commander was mistaken
In holding it to be a transport a
most serious situation will confront
llie state department. At the time the
Susex was sunk Germany was told
that this government could not tolerate
"regrettable mistakes."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. ? Former
Senator Hoot, in a paper read here
Thursday at the opening session of
the anti-suffrage convention, outlined
his reasons for opposition to the pro!
posed constitutional amendment to
i enfranchise women.
"I am against having the constitu1
tion of the United States amended so
as to impose woman suffrage on the
states which do not wish for it, not
merely or chiefly because my judgment
does not approve of woman suffrage.
but for a much more vital reason."
said Mr. Root's paper.

OPPOSED
AMENDMENT
such states as South Dakota and West
Virginia and New York and Pennsylvania
and Ohio, the advocates of
woman suffrage now seek to compel
such states to accept it against their
will and to compel them to carry
on their local government and select
their representatives in the national
government In conformity to the opinion
of the people of other states who
are in favor of woman suffrage. I
think such an attempt is contrary to
the principles of liberty, upon which
the American union was established
and without which it cannot endure."
