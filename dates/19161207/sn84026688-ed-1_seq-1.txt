On Ouard Against Fires.
State Forest Fire Protective
Force at Height of Autumn
Fire Prevention Season.
This is the forest fire period. Oc
euring semi-annually in the fall and
spring, when the woods are dry, it is
at these two times that forest fires
occur. The fall season is now more
than half-way past but not until
snows come will the danger period
be over.
Though there have been many fires
in 1916, and there will likely lie
many more, the amount of damage
has been much less than in former
years. This is attributable, accord
ing to the State’s Board of Forestry,
to at least two causes: Owners of
woodland are more and more begin
ning to realize their productive val
ue, and when fires occur they are not
neglected; and a special appropria
tion hy the last Legislature has made
it possible to bring about a closer,
lietter organization af Maryland’s
Forest Protective System. The pres
ent system consists of the State For
ester at Baltimore, who keeps in
touch with all the Wardens and to
whom all reports are made; and the
field force of 148 State Forest War
dens, 18 of whom are on special duty
as Federal Patrolmen under a co-op
erative arrangement with the U. S
Forest Service, which pays their sal
aries on a per diem basis, and three
IxHikout Watclmran stationed at Fire
Observations towers.
The remaining Forest Wardens are
especially authorized and delegated
to investigate and extinguish any
fires in their respective localities and
to employ all necessary means at the
expense of the State and County to
bring fires speedily under control.
Such a force, however efficient, can
not always prevent fires, with the
carelessness still prevalent in many
sections, yet when a fire occurs the
most important thing is to extinguish
it immediately, with the least dam
age and expense. And that is what
the Fire Protection System aims to
do. It also exercises a strong influ
ence in prevention by closely follow
ing up and investigating fires and
holding those who start them respon
sible under the Forest Law, whenever
sullicient evidence of guilt can he
found.
Soon after the fire season began E.
R. Ford, Assistant Forester, has been
constantly in the field, for moat of
the time in Western Maryland, in
vestigating fires and conferring with
the Forest Wardens and helping them
to improve local conditions and there
by increase the efficiency of the sys
tem as a whole. New Wardens and
and Patrolmen have been commis
sioned wherever special fire hazard
warranted, and the entire system is
being extended and its efficiency in
creased. Mr. Ford, who has recent
ly taken up this branch of the work,
reports that he finds the Forest War
dens thoroughly interested in the
work, highly respected in their com
munities, and doing a public service
at a nominal cost, since they receive
no salary hut are paid for services
rendered. These services are being
more and more appreciated as the
good results of the work become ap
parent.
An acquaintance with the local
Forest Wardens will prove profitable
in the conservation and protection of
the woodlands of the State. They
constitute an asset worth the best
that we can give them.
Forest Wardens for Frederick coun
ty are: S. P. Bussard, Lantz; Jas.
Delauter, Garfield; F. W. Fraley,
Catoctin; S. Moss, Frederick; Gide
on O. Harue, Point of Rocks; Albert
L. Hauver, Foxville; Chas. E. Klein,
Braddock Heights; Win. McP. Mc-
Gill, Catoctin; E. E. Feaga, Yellow
Springs.
Will Receive Full Pay.
Baseball players in the American
and National leagues, if injured on
the field, will receive their salaries
in full until the expiration of their
contract adopted at a special meeting
of the National Baseball Commission
at Chigago.
Under the old contract club own
ers were obliged to pay injured play
ers for 15 days and at the end of the
time dismiss them.

Big Sum For Defense.
Near Billion and a Half Asked
For 1917 and 1918.
The total sum asked for miliary
preparedness in fulfillment of the na
tional defense plans adopted hy (’(in
gress last August is $752,126,457.03.
The amount appropriated for military
and naval preparedness for the cur
rent fiscal year of 1917 is $615,616,-
934.50. For the two fiscal years of
1917 and 1918 the total planned to lie
spent for national miliary and naval
establishments, including plans for
increasing both the Army and Navy,
amounts to $1,867,740,392.
The estimates submitted to Con
gress when it met Monday that there
has been no liackward stride hy the
Wilson administration in its desire
to strengthen the Army and Navy.
These estimates show that both the
War and Navy departments are going
right ahead with the fulfillment to
the letter of the plans for perfecting
their respective branches of the ser
vice in accordance with the It gisla
tion adopted during the past suiy
mer.
For the Army the plans call for
the enlargement of the regular Army
until it aggregates a total of 280,663
officers and men at war strength and
the federalization of the National
(iuard as well as the formation of a
trained reserve corps, and collection
of vast reserve stocks of war munit
ions. The Army is to he increased
hy the formation of new ealvery, in
fantry and artillery regiments in
equal annual increments of new regi
ments of these arms of the service.
For the Navy the plans call for
the expendituce of over $500,000,000
on new naval construction and a
grand total of 157 new war vessels of
various types. The army increase is
spread over five years: the naval in
crease, over three years.
The estimates submitted today
shows that these sums are asked for
the military establishments proper:
Total for military establishment,
including support of the regular Army
National Guard, civilian military
training, Reserve Corps, Military
Academy, fortifieatians, arsenals,
military posts and miscellaneous,
$372,971,755.96; total for naval es

for both, $752,123,457.63; total for
lioth in 1617, $615,616,934.50; total
for 1917 and 1918, $1,367,740,392.-

Wants Three-Cent Piece.
Representative Linthicum, of Mary
land, a member of the House Com
mittee on Coinage, has introduced a
bill providing for the coinage of a
three-cent piece of standard weight
of 60 troy grains. This coin would
compare favorably with the one-eent
piece, except that it would be larger.
Fish Has a Huge Appetite.
When the lighthouse tender Corregl
dor pulled Into Manila it brought foe
the bureau of science uquariuin a mon
ster manatee, the first live fish of this
kind to be placed on exhibition there,
and with It one disgusted keeper, who
Informed the bureau officials gathered
at the pier to greet the new arrival,
that, "This fish, seguro, eats more than
a horse," and that It had taken prac
tically all of the time of three men col
lecting food for It, the Manila (P. I.)
Bulletin says.
The manatee, which arrived there in
the best of health apparently, seems
to Le almost entirely a vegetarian and
is particularly fond of a certain kind
of sea grass that is said to grow along
the Cavite coast, as well as In the wa
ters In which the fish was caught. A
good-sized banco full of the succulent
stems and leaves Is needed to appease
the captive’s normal appetite during a

HenMt Efforts.
Moses was fated never to enter the
land of promise he so longingly viewed
afar; and Columbus never found—who
can now wish that he had?—that un
impeded sea route westward to India
that he sought so wisely and so dar
ingly. Tet still the world moves on,
and by mysterious and unexpected
ways the great, brave soul Is permit

of Qpt} contemplating the elevation
and blessing of man. And so, I can
not doubt, the unselfish efforts in our
day for the amelioration of social
hardships, though their methods may
be rejected as mistaken or defective,
will yet signally conduce to their con
templated ends. Fall not, then, humble

When King George was at the front
recently, Private Thomas Turnbull of
the Worcester regiment was called out
of the trenches to be spoken to by the
king. Writing home to bis mother he
said, subsequently: "I cannot tell
what passed. I trembled all over.” A
few days later In the middle of fierce
lighting he remained with bis wound
ed officer for three hours under con
tinuous fire from machine guns and
bombs, and, although at cno time com
pletely cut off, he held his ground and
finally carried the officer Into the Brit-
Ish lines. He was a painter and paper
hanger by trade, and an enthusiastic
cyclist.
A young Yorkshire man named Don

During an attack, lu a heavy enfilade
fire, he crept up a communication
trench, followed by two men, rushed
across the open under heavy fire, shot
the machine gunner, destroyed the
gun ami personnel with bombs, saving
many lives and insuring the success
of the attack. For this he got the V.
C. He lost his life live days later In
a similar act of bravery.

“Soon afterward I reached the Ger

which our artillery had cut for us. The

firing down the trench and knocking

through him.
There was another Boche there,
and when he saw me he commenced
to run toward a dugout, but seemed
to slip tack a step, so I promptly got
him through the head. Another was
resting on one knee, and started shout
ing for mercy, but he paid the same
penalty. I next went round another
traverse, and found three more Ger
mans, and they all met with the same
(ate, either with tire bayonet or title
bullet. Hurrying round the next tra
verse I saw about seven Huns throw

200 VICTORIA
CROSSES WON
DURING THE WAR
Greatest Honor That Can Come
to Soldier Fighting for
Great Britain.
SOME HEROES LOSE LIVES
Deeds of Valor In Battle for Which
Men Were Decorated Make Task
Mere Thrilling Than Fiction-
Majority From Ranks of
Worker*.
London.—ln the course of the great
war nearly 200 British and colonial
soldiers have won the Victoria Cross,
the greatest honor that can come to
a man who fights for Great Britain.
Most of the awards have gone to men
of humble station. Two of them be
gun life so doubtfully that they "com
pleted their education" under the en
forced discipline of reformatories and
Industrial schools. Others were qulot
llving working-class folk before the
war.
But It Is curious to note that nearly
all of them seem to have had a spice
of the English love of games In their
natures —the games in which they
learned to be fearless of physical dan
ger and careful only for the achieve
ment of what they had In view. Take
the case of Private Janies Sillier, V.
C., of the lloyul Lancashire regiment,
of whom It Is said:
"lie was a great believer In keeping
cool. They called him a plodder, and
when he played football he suffered
from ‘luck of devil.’ Once he gave u
good hiding to a bigger fellow who
hud fouled him four times very badly.
Ue was a silent man and there was
nothing In his life to suggest that ho
was anything more than u very re
spectable, hard-working paper-mill la
borer.”
But this Is what be did:
round nt him und hit him. 1 was
dazed for u second, und did not know
whether to rush him or not, so ]
shouted to my party to get round the
traverse. I then reloaded and kept
guard wiille the officer and men be
hind threw bombs'at the enemy. A
little later we got word to retire, so
I kept guard while nr party got
clear of the trenches, and then mount
ed the ladder und made my way back,
covering the enemy while the lads got
the wounded In. Of the 03 men In the
whole raid 31 were reported missing,
21 got back wounded and 21 answered
the roll cull. After the shelling hud
subsided I was able to get back to the
village, and the next day had an Inter
view with the major general In charge
of the division. An officer took my
name and number and said that ]
would soon have something to wear
on my breast.”
That “something" Is the Victoria
Cross—with Its Inscription—“ For
Valor,”
Lieutenant Baxter's Exploit,
Lieutenant Baxter, a Liverpool man
who has .been awarded the Victoria
Cross posthumously, closed his career
with an exploit which stands out
prominently. Here is the official
story:
“Baxter was the captain of a dare
devil trench-raiding party known to
their comrades ns ‘the Forty Thieves’
because of the fact that they were
never known to come back from a
raid without a pile of swag In the
shape of captured Germans. One
night Baxter took his men out under
cover of machine gun fire. At a criti
cal moment Baxter tripped and drop
ped a bomb he was carrying. It was
when they were nearly through and
could hear the movements of a Ger
man sentry a few feet away. Baxter
had previously removed the split-pin,
and obviously the lever Hew out and
the fuse-commenced to fizz. Within
five seconds It would have exploded,
scattered the wire party and given the
whole show away. Scarcely hesitat
ing to think of the risk, he picked It
up, whipped the case plug out of the
screw und threw away the detonator,
which went off unnoticed. It was o
fine example of merit, skillfulness and
resource. But more was to follow.
"The party cut all the wire that de
fended the German trench and leaped
Into the trench and turned In single
file alternately right and left, one sec
tion led by Sergeant McClelland and
the other by Baxter. This trench was
very deep, about twelve to fifteen feet,
ami It was obvious that there would
be trouble In hauling out any fat and
unwilling souvenir of the occasion in
the shape of a prisoner.
Tribute in Orders.
“The sentry they had heard was
promptly shot. Another was bayonet
ed und us he fell back a bomb was
thrown out of a dugout and exploded
at the entrance, fortunately doing the
raiders no damage. Six bombs were
sent In byway cf an exchange of com
pliments and mere sentries were met
und given the unhappy dispatch.
They screamed like a lot of old wom
en,’ said one man who was on the spot.
The bombers attended to three more
dugouts, and afterwards the whole
party withdrew, without noise and
confusion, on a prearranged signal be-
Ifig given. They returned to their
own trenches to the tune of rapid fire
all along the whole front from the
British field guns und ‘heavies.’
“It was a glorious little exploit, but
sad tidings awaited the party on re
assembling In their own line, for no
where was the gallant Baxter. Search
parties went out for him, but without
success. It was certain that he had
climbed out of the euemy’s trench,
for he helped to pull up the last man
of his party, aud the only assumption
was that he hud been either killed or
captured on returning there,
“Next day’s battalion orders con
tained this fitting tribute to Baxter:
‘lt was largely owing to this officer’s
pluck, determination, coolness und
resource that the raid was successful.
Dead or missing, he is a great loss to
the battalion.’ ”
Thut is the story of the “Forty
Thieves.”
Kid Kills Giants.
Private Albert Hill was a Lan
cashire lad engaged lu a hat works
whoa the war broke out—of small
stature, still in his teens. . He won
the V. C. at tire Somme aud his platoon
sergeant, just invalided home, tells
for the first time the full story of how
he did It:
"Ou the plght of July 10 we moved
up to the advanced line of attack. It
was three o’clock lu the morning when
wo got to the bottom, 15 yards away
from the German trenches. Hill and
myself were alone. Suddenly two Ger
mans, both about six feet tall, sur
prised us. They were making for us
when Hill, as coolly us if he had been
going to meet a boxing opponent,
sprang at them and us quick us light
ning bayoneted them both. It was one
of the finest pieces of pluck f have
ever seen or read about, this little fel
low, only five feet three, accounting
for two big, burly Huns. He returned
to me ns If nothing had happened; and
the next thing we found that we were
surrounded by some twenty to twenty
five Germans. Hill remarked: ‘Ser
geant, we look like being taken pris
oners.' I replied: ‘They will not take
us alive. We will fight for It. No
sooner said than done. We both got
our bombs and Hill flung two bombs
with surprising accuracy straight lu
the midst of them. He killed about
eighteen aud wounded aud scattered
the rest.
Proud of His “Bag.''
“Still he did.not think he had done
mythlng big, and when I suggested he
should go to the right and try to find
tome of our company he was ready la
stantly. He went and reported to the
sergeant, and heard while there that
Captain Scales and a scout were lying
jut dangerously wounded. Hill at once
volunteered to fetch them in. He suc
ceeded In bringing the captain to safe
ty, but the ofticer died soon after.
‘‘Hill then started to return to me,
sut on the way he found two Germans
n a shell hole. How he found them la
a puzzle, for It was dark. He leveled
tils rllle at them and the Huns put up
doth hands before this little man and,
us they always do, pleaded ‘Mercy,
kamerad.’ Hill then took his prisoners
down the line and that was the only
time he thought he hud done any
thing big. He was proud of his bag.’
He performed all these feats In less
than half an hour.”
One particular Incident stirred Eng
land deeply. It was the death of John
Truvors Cornwell in the battle of Jut
land. A boy of sixteen on U. M. S.
Chester, ho was mortally wounded
early In the light. Nevertheless lie re
mained standing alone at a most ex
posed post to the end of the action,
with the gun’s crew dead and wound
ed all around him. He said simply,
when asked why he had remained
there, he thought that he might be
wanted. The hoy’s body was brought
back to England and burled by his
parents in a London cemetery. The
British people had not then heard the
story of his death, but when Sir John
Jelllcoe's dispatch was published tell
ing about young Cornwell’s heroism a
wave of emotion swept over the coun
try.
Two months afterward the coflin
was disinterred and burled with hon
ors In a new grave.
Wins V, C. Twice.
One man has won the V. C. twice In
the present war. Ho was still alive
wlu'ii last heard from and may jVt win
the medal again. Lieut. John Jacka
of the Fourteenth battalion of Aus
tralian Infantry is the man. He won
the V. C. first In the fighting at Gal
lipoli. He was then a corporal. On
May 18, 11(15, the Turks made a fierce
attack on the position held by the Aus
tralians. The onslaught was one of
the most furious of the disastrous
series of battles that marked the Gal
lipoli campaign. It was necessary to
capture a certain part of a Turkish
trench and Jacka undertook to accom
plish that Job alone. He got in be
hind the trench. With his rllle Jacka
shot down five Turks, with his bayo
net he killed two more, and the three
who remained tc oppose him he cap
tured. Ills achievement saved a part
of the allied Hue.
On August 5 last Jacka won his V.
C. tlie second time at the battle of the
Si mine. Ile had been promoted to a
lieutenancy and was in command of a
platcoa sent to relieve a force of An
zacs in an advanced trench near
IVzleres. In the morning Jacka s lit
tle command was attacked by a force
of (300 Germans. Only seven of Jacka's
men, Including himself, remained alive
after that charge. These seven decid
ed tc die fighting, even against over
whelming odds. With bayonets they
charged at the Germans. They fought
like tigers and were able to keep the
Germans busy until the reserves came
up and the tide turned. It Is said that
nob a single German of that GOO got
away. Many were killed and some
were captured.
In any record of the Victoria Cross
one cannot emit the name of Lieuten
ant W’arneford, the first man to de
stroy a Zeppelin single-handed. A few
days after his exploit W’arneford was
killed while flying with an American
newspaper man.

SAFETY DEMANDS
FEDERAL CONTROL
OF THE RAILROADS
Only Way to Meet Emergencies
of Nation, Says A. P. Thom.
STATES’ RIGHTS PRESERVED
Principles Which Railways Hold Should
Govern Regulatory System In Inter
ests of Public and the Roads—Com
pulsory System of Federal Incorpo
ration Favored.
Washington, Dec. 4.-That the Inter
ests of nulloiiHl defense require that
control of railway lines should rest
with I lie federal government and not
with the states was the claim ad
vanced by Alfred P. Thom, counsel
to the Railway Executives’ Advisory
Committee, in concluding bis prelim
inary statement of the case for tlie
railways before Hie Newlands Joint
Committee on Interstate Commerce.
‘‘We must be efficient as a nation if
we are to deal successfully with our
national emergencies,” said Mr. Thom,
‘‘and we must appreciate that efficient
transportation is an essential condition
of national efficiency. If we are to
bait and weaken our transportation
systems by state lines, by the perma
nent Imposition of burdens by pawlse
regulation, we will make national effi
ciency Impossible.”
States’ Rights Would Not Suffer.
Mr. Thorn cited many Instances tu
which shippers In one state were in
juriously affected by selfish regula
tions Imposed on the railroads by
neighboring states, lie pointed out
that federal regulation would be no in
vasion of the rights of the states but
would be the means of preserving the
rights which they acquired when they
entered the Cnion, one of which was
the right to the free movement of their
products across state boundaries.
What the Railroads Advocate.
The principles which the railroad*
believe should be Incorporated in any
just system of regulation were sum
marized hy Mr. Thom as follows;
1. The entire power and duty of reg
illation should be in the hands of the
national government, except as to mat
ters so essentially local and Incidental
that they cannot be used to Interfere
with the efficiency of the service or the
just lights of the carriers.
2. As one of the means of accom
pushing this, a system of compulsory
federal Incorporation should be adopt
cd. into which should be brought all
railroad cor|Mirations engaged In inter
state or foreign commerce.
3. The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion under existing laws has too much
to do and is charged with conflicting
functions, including the investigation,
prosecution and decision of cases. The
latter duties should be placed In the
bands of a new body which might he
called the Federal Railroad Commis
sion. Regional Commissions should
be established In different parts of
the country to assist the Interstate
Commerce Commission by handling lo
cal eases.
4. The power of the Commission
should be extended to enable it to pre
scribe minimum rates and not merely
maximum rates as at present. This
would increase their power to prevent
unjust discriminations.
Justice to Public and Roads.
5. It should he made the duty of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, In
the exercise of Its powers to fix rea
sonable rates, to so adjust these rules
that they shall tie Just at once to the
public and to the curriers. To this etui
the Commission, in determining rates,
should consider the necessity of main
taining efficient transportation and ex
tensions of facilities, the relation of
expenses to rates and the rights of
shippers, stockholders and creditors of
the roads.
fi. The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion should bo invested with the [low
er to (lx the rates for carrying mails.
7. The federal government should
have exclusive [lower to supervise the
Issue of stocks and bonds by railroad
carriers engaged In interstate and for
eign commerce.
8. The law should recognize the es
sential difference between things which
restrain trade In the ease of ordinary
mercantile concerns ami those which
restrain trade in the case of common
carriers. The question of competition
Is not the only fair criterion.
1). The law should expressly provide
for the meeting and agreement of traf
fic or other officers of railroads In re
sjieet of rates or practices. This
should, however, be safeguarded by
requiring the agreements to ho filed
with the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and to he subject to be disapprov
ed by it.
‘‘My legal proposition,” Mr. Thom
said, ‘is that the Constitution ns It
now is gives full authority to Congress
to regulate the Instrumentalities of in
terstate commerce in all their parts.
If the power of regulation Is to reach
fhe public requirements, It must be co
extensive with the Instrumentalities of
commerce."
Mr Thom explained that the roads
are not asking either of the Committee
or of Congress any Increase in reve
nues, but that they are merely asking
the perfection of a system which will
be responsible to any need that mu)
arise.
