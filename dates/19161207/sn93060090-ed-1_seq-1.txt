Dear Sir and Brother;- To
set you light on your, false and
amising notion that "The old
Latin language" was used be
fore the building of the tower
of Bable, will say that the Latin
language wa tho language of
the ancient Romans, The
Romans were the people of
Rome a city foundpd some 600
or 700 years B. C. There never
was any Lfttain language before
the time of the Romans for the
simple reason that they founded
the language. Now the tower of
Babel was many centurif-s be
fore this Roman or Latain
tongue was in existence, Hence
the absurdity of your assertion,
I do not know what language
was spoken before the time of
big tower. So far as I know,
neither sacred or profane hist
ory tell us. But to say that It
was Latain ' Is a most absurd
assumption. You had Just as
well say it was German or Engl
ish or French or Cherokoe.
In your reply in the Cresset
of Nov. 23 you fail to offer a bit
of proof of your jocular Latin
deduction." Tell your readers
next wfeek where you ran across
that freaky notion. Bette r still
just admit that you are wrong
Now I am writing you In all
kindness, I wish you well. f
you prove me wrong. I shall
freely admit ic.
Yours,
G. W, Corporn,
Wo have received the aboye
letter; with many thanks to the
writer. For we must believe
from a legal stand point of law
as a lawyer, the brother, has a
great desire to lift up the fallen,
and to right all wrongs. And
we know that tho mission work
of a preacher should be . to help
the transgressor, out of the
miry clay, and horriable pit. and
to help place his feet upon the
solid . Rock, Christ Jesus the
Lord i
And now Dear Readers you
must not think bard of our Deir
Brother, for talking to plain to
us: in that which he thinks we
are wrong in. For at we said
above and wish to repeat, that it
a lawyers duty to right all
wrong, if it lay in his power,
and a great deal more so a
preacher, This last part I know
by myself,

Now Bro, you are a lawyer.
And I claim "..to t.fe a pi-eiinlier.
my respons.bility K if thf ro U
any diffsrenoo, treatr than
yours, For the gn titer respon
sibility of our mission is the
soul, and yours as a lawyer, is
the consequences of this life.
Yet as a personal waV.sr, bo'h

Brother if you prove me wrong,
we wish to say to you there is
no one, who will be more ready
o acknowledge their wrong,
than we will, But as ytt, my
Dear Bro., you have given us no
reason whaterer, that we should
say that we are wrong, or that
we should acknowledge that we
are wrong, in using the words,
The real old latin language."
inor.ler that wo might designate
the languaga that was used
when the whole earth was of
one language. ,Tbat is before
the building of, the Tower of
Babe!, And we wish to say to
jou my Brother, that we had no
reference to the latin language
which was used by tbe Romans
600 or 700 years before Christ,
or what is called the modern
language.
We must repeat tHat we had
direct reference to th8 language
used, when the people was all
of one language. And we wish
to say that the same language
will again be used by all people,
For "God has said,
"For then will I turn to the
people a pure language, that
they may all call upon the name
of the Lord, to serve him with
one consent." (Zeph. 39,1
Now then Dear Brother if it
will suit you any better for us
to call it a "pure language, we
will call it a pure language, in
the place of The Real Old
Latin Language" For there is
no mistake but what the lan
guage used before the building
of the Tower of ; Babel, was a
pure language. But you say
that you do not know what it
was called. So we repeat that
we shall call it "Tbe Pure Old
Latin Language" For God has
said there is nothing new under
tbe sun, Please read.
"The thing that hath been
it is that which shall be; and
that which is done, Is that which
shall be done: and there is no
new thing under tbe sun."
(Eccle. 1-9,)
Now then we find tbat there
must be restitution of all
things. For it is written.
"And be shall send Jesus
Christ which before was preach -el
unto you.
Whom the heavens must re
ceive until tbe times of restitu
tion xf all things which God hath
spoken by the mouth of all bis
holy prophets since tbe world
began.'' (Acts. 8-20-21)
Wherefore we must say, that
the time mast come, when that
pure real old Latten Language

and all mna then will worship
God with ono consent. Then
the pure gems ol the mind will
io'e over the p!ains of time. And
tbe richness of perfection will
e as in days befoie the build
iog of the tower of Bable, As
it is written.
"Thou wast perfect in thy ways
from tbe day tbat thou wast
created till iniquity was found in
thee." Ezek. 28-15)
Now dpar renders you will see,
from wbat we ljave given you
from the word of God, that there
was in the early days of our
time, a pure language.
Tbe Bro. says that he does not
know what it was, and we have
also read you, tbat there was not
only a pure language. But also
a pprfection. And it must be
again. For it is written again.
"For the earth shall bo filled
with the knowledge of the glory
of the Lord as the watrs cover
tbe sea." (Hab. 214)
When this knowledge comes
then all will know tho Lord from
the least to the greatest, Then
the people will be all of one lan
gnage. That is the pure old
latin language once more, the
same that was used when the
wlmle "earth were of ore lan
guage. Then the Bro, will know
why we called is the real old
latten language, if not before.
But we shall endavor to (show
him this truth now.
Now Bro- you have said that
you did not know of any history
sacred or profane, that spoke
anything about this language.
Whenever men do not know,
it then becomes necessary for

dear reader whenever you find
