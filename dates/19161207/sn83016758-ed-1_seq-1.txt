FAVORS SMALL FARM
Personal Experience of Richard Hamer
a Successful Town of Milo
Dairy Farmer.
The 40 Acre Farmer Often Draws
a Larger Creamery Check Than
His 160-Acre Neighbor-
Mr. Richard Hamer, one of Milo's
most progressive farmers, furnishes
the text of a front page article in the
current number of the Northwest
Farmstead, which is herewith repro
duced:
Is the 40-acre to 80-acre dairy farm
practicable, or are these examples of
successes made on places of such lim
ited acreages merely isolated cases?
People generally are inclined to be
lieve that to try to make money on
anything less than 160 acres is a waste
of time. They hear now and then of
of a farmer on a 40 or an 80 who is
getting along very well, but they con
clude that it must be because he is
exceptionally smart or works like a
slave. Of late years, though, so many
of these successful 40, 60 and 80-acre
fellows are getting their names in the
papers that it begins to look as though
there was something in it besides
just hard work and being smart.
Richard Hamer is the secretary of
the big creamery at Milaca, Minn.
Here is what he has to say about the
small dairy farmer: "It is my duty
twice a month to sign about 375
creamery checks and frequently I ob
serve that the man on a 40-acre farm
gets a larger check than another who
pays taxes on 160 acres. When a man
on 40 acres gets a cream check that
amounts to $1.50 to $1.75 per month
for every acre of his farm, in addi
tion to the other things that con
tribute to his income, he is not in
any immediate danger of starvation.
There are thousands of cases where
the 40-acre farm is large enough."
Mr. Hamer would go so far as to say
that a man should be slow about going
into the dairy business. on a large
farm unless he has help enough in his
own family to run the farm and care
for the cows. Measured by the success
jthat the dairyman on the small farm
has and the difficulty that others
sometimes experience in getting help,
he concludes that the 80-acre dairy
farm, is the most satisfactory.
But because a man has 160 acres or
200 acres or a section of land is no
sign that he cannot make as much
per acre out of dairying as the 40-acre
man. The hired help problem is one
of individual settling anyway. Every
man knows from his own experience
vhat "he can do with hired help. The
really important things in connection
wih dairying seem to be the selection
of the dairy cows and the care and
intelligence with which they are han
dled. TMr. Hamer is in a position to
make close and accurate observations
along those lines. He is a dairyman
himself. The Guernsey was his choice.
He says that the Guernsey is larger,
more hardy and of better disposition
than the Jersey. The Holstein is very
popular among the dairymen of the
Milaca country and Mr. Hamer rec
ognizes the good points of the famous
black and white breed, but he is strong
for a high test cow and so bought the
Guernsey. The Holstein, he says, is
the cow for the man who wants a big
flow of milk. In this section the Hol
stein fellows not only sell a great
amount of butterfat, but tney utilize
ilie skim milk to good advantage by
feeding it to pigs and calves. Veal
calves and hogs are sources of hun
dreds of big by-product incomes to'
the dairy farmers there and in hun
dreds of other places in the American
"Northwest.
BRAINS AND BLOOD COUNT.
In order to promote the introduction
of better dairy blood into the herds of
the Milaca community a breeders' as
sociation was organized four years
ago. Both Guernsey and Holstein
owners belong the association. The
aim of the association is to improve
the herds by using pure-bred .regis
tered sires, and to discourage cross
"breeding and inbreeding. The asso
ciation is meeting with constantly in
creasing success in accomplishing its
purpose. More farmers are buying
pure-bred sires each year, and gradu
ally the grade and dairy stock in the
community is improving.
A few farmers in that section have
the dual purpose cows. The attempt
there to raise this class of stock is
neither a success nor a failure. Cases
there are where a pretty good flow of
,^n41k is obtained and the owner re
ceives a pretty respectable sized cream
check and when he comes to put his
wo-year-olds or three-year olds on
the beef market he has critters that
are of good fair weight. But fre
quently the amount of milk or the
weight of the beef stuffone or the
othermust be sacrificed. And the
question arises as to whether it would
not be better to hit either the dairying
or the livestock raising hard and not
try to make a success of both. Com
menting^ on this subject, Mr. Hamer
cites a shipment of stock from Milaca
made recently. "There were six car
loads of livestock shipped out of here
that week," he said. "If these ani
mals were of beef type they would
have brought larger returns than they
did, but these would not, even then,
equal the regular cream checks from
good dairy cows."
In the line of feeding there is one
thing that Mr. Hamer strenuously ob
jects to and that is too close pastur
ing. Good pasture, rightly used, he
says, is equal in value, acre for acre,
to meadow land. The pasturage is
the cheapest and best feed they have
in the Milaca country. In part the
pastures there will be found on land
that has not yet been brought under
cultivation, some that is too rough oi
meadow land and the woods and un
cleared lands. However, the pasturage
should be such, says Mr. Hamer, that
the cows can fill up quickly and then
give up their energies to milk produc
tion. Close pasturing not only neces
sitates a misuse of the cows' energies,
he adds, but also checks the growth
of the grass on the principle that the
rootseven those of quack grass
may be killed by sufficiently close
cropping at the surface.
The right kind of a pasture, that is,
both in size and in grass, should be
such that in the summer the grass
grows twice as fast as the cows can
eat it. Mr. Hamer keeps his cows in
the same pasture all summer and up
to the first part of October. "I really
believe that such pastures produce
more per acre in the way of milk than
those that are peeled bare all sum
mer, and that the grass roots will not
be injured by the freezings and thaw
ing of the late winter and early sum
mer, as the roots on the closely
cropped pastures are bound to be," he
says. Ground corn, oats and barley
are the feeds grown on the farm that
are used mostly by the, dairymen of
the Milaca country. The necessary
protein is bought usually in the form
of oil meal and sometimes cotton meal.
Clover and clover and timothy are the
hays fed.
Town Team Wins.
The opening basket ball team of
1916-17 season was staged at the
Armory last Thursday afternoon,
when the town team opposed the high
school quint. A spirited contest was
the result, and the town team annex
ing the long end of a 35 to 24 count.
The high school lads inaugurated a
powerful offensive at the outset and
scored five points before the villagers
realized that play had started. Mil
brath, Jesmer and Raiche soon got
their sights adjusted, however, and the
first two each negotiated four field
goals, while the latter tossed a free
throw and two field goals. The high
school scored occasionally also, and
when time was sounded the count
stood 21 to 12.
In the second half the high school
quint again started with a rush, and
at one time the orange and black rep
resentatives were within three points
of their opponents. Again the town
team showed up strong toward the
end, and the count at the end of this
half was 14 to 12.
At the outset the two teams lined up
as follows:
Town Team Pos. High School
Jesmer _... R. Kaliher
Raiche L. r. Winsor
Milbraith Briggs
Umbehocker (R.
Both teams made a good showing
for the opening game, and some classy
contests can be looked forward to this
season by followers of the great in
door game.
Smith went in during the final ten
minutes and heaved the ball through
the net a couple of times.
Tom Olsen acted as referee and got
by without a kick. Of course he gave
the high school the edge but that was
to be expected. Tom kept the play go
ing all the time. Bob Berg officiated
as umpire and also did well.
The high school team is fast on the
floor, and clever in the passing de
partment. The boys will make things
decidedly interesting for any high
school quint in this section.
Hill went in for Kaliher in the first
half, and Oelschlager took Winsor's
place during the final period in the
high school line-up.
Grow and Winsor did the bulk of
the offensive work for the high school.

Thanksgiving Ball a Success.
One of the largest crowds of lovers
of the light fantastic ever congregated
at the Armory attended the Thanks
giving ball under the auspices of the
basket ball boys last Thursday even
ing, and it proved to be a most en
joyable affair. Anderson's orchestra
was at its best, and rendered the lat
est dance selections from 9 o'clock p.
m. until 3 a.m., when the "Home Sweet
Home" waltz was played. Supper
was served at the Riverside hotel, and
it was a most appetizing repast. The
total receipts from the sale of dance
tickets amounted to $106, and the
management is duly grateful for the
more than generous" patronage.
GREAT SCHOOL FOND
Minnesota's Wonderful School Fund
Equals That of a Dozen Other
Rich States Combined.
Auditor Doane Has Distributed Octo-
ber Apportionment to Schools
of Mille Lacs County.
County Auditor Doane has made the
October apportionment of the current
school fund of the state to the schools
of Mille Lacs county. The rate of ap
portionment was $3.6512 to each pupil
of school districts that had complied
with the law and were entitled to.
share in the distribution.
The sum of $11,884.88 was divided
between the school districts of the
county, representing 3,255 scholars.
The first apportionment of the state
school fund was made in 1863, and
Minnesota's school fund has grown
enormously since then. The amount
distributed in 1863 was $12,308.45,
while the amount distributed this year
will be nearly $3,000,000.
Minnesota's school fund in 1914
totaled $21,931,182.13. The school
fund of a dozen other rich states
would scarcely reach so large a figure
and it is constantly growing. Within
50 years it is expected that the fund
will reach the stupendous total of
$200,000,000 or more. This fund is
the fruit of the wise policy instituted
by the framers of the constitution, in
setting aside in perpetuity all the pro
ceeds of the lands with which the state
was dowered by congress. Mineral
deposits on state lands yield a large
revenue to the permanent school fund.
A one-mill tax levied on all the prop
erty of the state as well as certain
small fines are also credited to this
fund. Minnesota is now in the front
rank of educated communities, and a
few years hence it will be able to
make such provision for the education
of its children as has never been
equaled in history.
The apportionment is made twice
a year, in March and October, and the
October apportionment of the school
fund in Mille Lacs county is as fol
lows: One-half of penalty and interest

Mille Lacs County Growing.
A neat map has been issued by the
State Tax Commission giving the as
sessed value per acre of unplatted land
in the- state for the years 1914 and
1916. The assessed value of Mille
Lacs lands for 1914 was $8.28 per
acre, the county board fixed it at $8.10
this year, and the Tax Commission
raised it to $8.97. Mille Lacs county's
valuation will increase rapidly in the
next ten years. At present only the
six southern townships of the county
are fairly well settled and developed.
When the central and northern town
ships are equally as well developed
Mille Lacs county will be one of the
best little counties in northern Minne
sota.

Annual Fair Meeting.
The annual meeting of the Mille
Lacs County Agricultural society was
held at the office of McMillan & Stan
ley, Tuesday afternoon, with President
Andrew Bryson presiding. The min
utes of the previous meeting were
and approved, as were the reports of
the treasurer and secretary.
The treasurer's report showed that
there were 1,826 entries at the 1916
fair, and that $1,226.60 was paid out
in premiums.
The total receipts for the year
amounted to $5,885.90. The disburse
ments totalled $3,858.86, as follows:
Advertising .7. $181.84
Permanent improvements 432.44
Expense 466.59
Amusements 966.24
Premiums, interest, etc 1,811.75
There is a cash balance in the treas
ury of $27.04.
Lack of space prevents the publica
tion of the itemized report, but same is
on file in the office of the Register of
Deeds, and can be inspected by anyone
interested. Needless to state N every
dollar expended has been properly ac
counted for.
That the society is in a flourishing
condition is evidenced by-thefafct'tfaat
the resources are $9,816.60, while the
VOLUME XL. NO. 51
total indebtedness is $5,250. Thus it
will be seen that the resources exceed
the liabilities by $4,566.60. The in
debtedness of the society will be fur
ther reduced on or before Dec. 25,
next, when about $1,200 reimburse
ment from the state for premiums
paid will be received.
It is to be hoped that a suitable
buildings for school exhibits will be in
readiness for the 1917 fair. The sec
retary now has $202.03 credited to
this fund, received from various school
districts of the county. The money is
on deposit in a bank, drawing inter

Wahkon Harold Mudgett, Mudgett
J. A. Allen, Milaca M. C. Thorring,
Bogus Brook.
This concluded the business of the
annual meeting, but the directors met
at once and organized by re-electing
all the old officers, viz: Andrew Bry
son, president R. D. Byers, vice-pres
ident C. A. Jack, treasurer Ira G.
Stanley, secretary. Each one of them
has attended to his duties in a fault
less manner, and it is largely due to
their untiring efforts that the Mille
Lacs county fair is generally recog
nized as the leading exposition of
northeastern Minnesota. They should
have the co-operation of all good citi
zens.
