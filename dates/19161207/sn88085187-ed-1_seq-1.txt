TERROR REIGN!
Wild Disorder in Rumania
as German War Machine
Smashes on Way; Many
Children Are Dying.

QUARTERB IN RUMANIA,
Doc. 4.— (Via wireless to the
United Press.)— Every hun
dred yards there Ih something
dead or dying ln Rumania.
Tlie country Ih mad with ter
ror. Anarchy and chaos
reign everywhere, and tho
misery of the Inhabitants is
terrible.
It is to bring order out of this
chaos that Gen. yon Tulff, former
military administrator to Poland,
before Warsaw's fall, has been
named German governor-general
of Rumania.
The Rumanians, ordered from
their homes by their government,
clogged the roads, most of them
with a few belongings packed on
small ox cartß. The advancing
Uernianß overtook these refugees.
Wildest Anarchy.
Then they turned back toward
their homes, only to find ln
thousands of instances that every
thing they had left behind had
been plundered by other Ruma
nians.
As we rode through Rammlcu
and Walkla the wildest anarchy
prevailed. The streets were lit
tered with household good*, pa
pers, window curtains, dead horses
and dogs.
Meanwhile bands of Rumanian
gypsies went from house to house
and shop to shop, smashing win
dows and again plundering the
homes already half destroyed.
These plundering bands -men,
women and children- piled what
they could not carry on their own
backs on stolen horses or cows.
Many Children Die,
Because of deprivations and the
roaming on muddy, cold Rumanian
roads, the mortality of children
among these miserable refugees
has been very high.
One can hardly sleep at night
because of the constant barking of
deserted dogs. Along the roads
lay dead or dying horses. Starving
dogs gnaw the flesh of these bod
ies and crows pick at their eyes.
The terror that is apparent
ererywhere Is In striking contrast
to the maps which hung In every
Rumanian home and which had
been use.i as part of the propa
ganda to get the Rumanians to
favor war.
These mapc show a "greater Ru
mania," the boundaries of
which extend far into Austria-
Hungary.
Instead of Rumania's ambitions
being realized, Rumania herself
has fallen before the invader.
ADMIT FALL OF CITY

PARIS, Dec. 7.—The Ruma

Allen & Lamborn, printing firm, has informed
Mayor Fawcett that it will print the ballots for the
Jan. 6 bond election free of charge.
A considerable number of other enthusiastic citi

These people feel, they told the mayor, that they
want to do at least that much toward helping along
the common good.
A committee of public spirited business men had
subscribed $3500 to meet the costs of the election.
But the volunteer workers take the position they
do not want their neighbors' money as pay for ad
vancing an enterprise that is going to do them as
much good as it will the donors of the fund. In short,
they want to show their public spirit, too.
It is this sort of a feeling that makes communities
go forward.
A campaign that is waged between Thanksgiving

auspicious.
