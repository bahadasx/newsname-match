WOULD MAKE
SUMMER RESORT OE
CHAUTAUQUA PARK
Association Controls 80-acre
Tract Abjoining Chautau
qua Grounds .
PUN 10 PLOT THE
GROUNDS AND SAVE TREES
Chautauqua Park to be made
Playground of New
Mexico
A movement is under way, which if
carried out will mean much to Moiin
tainair and the Chautauqua. The Chau
tauqua Association has secured title to
the whole of the eighty-acre tract of
land adjoining the Chautauqua grounds.
In order to accomplish this, John W.
Corbett proposed to the association
that if that body would secure the in
terest of the other parties concerned,
he would turn his interest over to the
association on any terms they thought
just. The deal is now being consum
mated, and the association will control
the whole tract of land. It is the pur
pose of those in charge of the matter
to lay out the grounds, following the
topographical contour of the land, into
uitable building lots, for summer cot
tages. By following irregular rather
than straight lines, not only will the
lots lay better for building, but practi
cally all of the trees and shrubs de
tired, can be saved. When this shall
have been done, no more beautiful place
can be found in the state for the build
ing of summer cottages a place to get
away from the heat, flies and mosqui
toes of lesser altitudes, into the cedars
and health-laden mountain air.
No doubt when this project is once
really launched, residents of the cities
will take up the idea and make this
what it should be a real Bummer re
sort. Being within easy auto distance
of Albuquerque, this will appeal strong
ly to the residents of the Duke City,
who can thus get away from business
cares and the heat of the Rio Grande
Valley to spend the week-end among
the cedars. It is a wise move on the
part of the Chautauqua Association,
and should be pushed to an early con
summation. When this shall have been
done, Mountainair will become "The
Play Ground of New Mexico."

STEAL 40 SACKS Of BEANS
Mrs. A. Kubena was in town yester
dayt morning looking for officers te help
her trail a couple of thieves who got
away with forty sacks of beans from
her farm sometime during Tuesday
night. She says she is sure from the
tracks that there were two of the fel
lows, and that they carried the beans
to the fence and then loaded them in a
wagon.
A number of our people are righ
teously indignant that the thieves
should single out a widow, who had
worked hard all summer to grow her
crop and make a living, for their de
predation. If caught, there is a possi
bility of summary justice being meted
out

JUDGE RODEY TALKS
INTERESTINGLY TO
SCHOOLCHILDREN
Total Enrollment has Reached
One Hundred Thirty
Four
92 PER CENT. Of NUMERA
TION IN ATTENDANCE
New Song Books Ordered for
School Use
On Tuesday of this week Judge B. S.
Rodey, who spent two years in Alaska
and many years in Porto Rico as Fed
eral Judge, spent an hour in our Public
Schools and delivered a very interest
ing and instructive lecture on Alaska
and her products. He said tht from
his two years experience, he istatisfied
that Alaska will never be an agricul
tural territory, but said she is extreme
ly rich in gold, copper, coal, fish and
furs. Mr. Rodey described the differ
ent methods of mining gold and inter
ested the children in the Alaskan's
mode of travel . The students of all
ages listened attentively to his descrip
tion of the almost continuous day and
almost continuous night at opposite
seasons of the year. The Judge's story
of a baseball game that he attended
one night in June was very much en
joyed. The game was called at 10:30
p. m. and ended at 1:30 a. m. In all,
the lecture was very interesting and
the children showed their intelligence
by their attention and appreciation.
The total enrollment to date has
reached 134 with a per cent, of actual
attendance for the first three months
averaging 95.
When we consider the enumeration
for the entire district is 173 and Moun-
tainair's eniollment of 134, and that of
Pleasant View of 25 ora total of 159
out of a possible 173, we have ,92 per
cent, of the entire district enrolled in
our schools. If there is a district in
the state with a higher per centage of
their enumeration enrolled we would be
glad to hear from it.
The Bust of Riley and the painting
of the Ok?. Swimmin' Hole have arrived
and add to the beauty and attractive
ness of our auditorium.
One hundred new song books have
been ordered, and we look forward to
many pleasant mornings during the
year. The pupils ana lacuity win as
semble on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays of every week from 9:00 to
9:20. The exercises will consist of read
ings, recitations, debates, songs, vocal
and piano solos and general singing bv
the entire school. Mrs. McNeese will
have charge of the program and since
the pupils are all so willing to do their
part, our assembly periods are sure to
be enjoyable and beneficial. The gen
eral public is cordially invited to meet
with us and we trust many will avail
themselves of the opportunity.
Our Roll of Honor appears in this is
sue of the Independent. We trust every
pupil and patron of the school will be
interested.
Next week we hope to publish our
entire enrollment so that you can real
ize what a crowd of little folks we
have and at the same time prove to you
that Mountainair with a population of
less than a hundred has 134 of them in
school.
Pie Supper
A Pie Supper will be held at the
Means Schoolhouse on Tuesday even
ing, December 12, to which all are cor
dially invited. 'The ladies are asked to
bring pies, that there may be sufficient
for all. The proceeds will be used in
making repairs on the school building
and toward securing suitable seats. Its
a worthy aim, and all are urged to
help. "Dad" Sharpless will act al
auctioneer.
