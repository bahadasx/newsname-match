With Duty of Proving Otherwiee.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Germany In a
note made public by the state depart
ment today contends that the British
steamer Arabia, sunk in the Mediter
ranean on Nov. 6, was In reality "a
transport ship for troops in the ser
vice of the British government, which
is to be considered an auxiliary War
ship and can therefore be treated like
a warship."
The German government's attitude,
howewAgrWie that in the Marina case.
Is expressed to be one of readiness to
make amends if it be shown that the
submarine oommander violated Ger
many's pledges to the United States
Text of Note.
The note, addressed to Charge Grew,
in reply to his inquiry made on instruc
tions from Washington, follows:
"Foreign office, Berlin, Dec. 4, 1916.—
The undersigned has the honor to In
form Mr. Grew, charge d' affaires of
the United States of America, In reply
to the note of the 21st ult., that the
evidence of the German government
concerning the sinking of the steamer
Arahia has led to the following re
sults:
"On the morning of Nov. 6 the sub
marine Encountered a large steamer
coming from Corregio straits. 'The
steamer was painted black and. had a
black superstructure .and not, as is
otherwise the case with P. & O. line
superstructures, a light color.
"The steamef was not on the route
regularly used' by passenger steamers
between Port Said arid Malta, which Is
made plain on the enclosed map, but
was .taking, a siz-zag course to the
northwest. This course, on which the
subn*uri*^ passed three similar qtearn
ers at th? same spot on the same morn
ing, leads from tjie Aegb^^MMta,
so that -the Arabia'was moving on the
transport route, Correglo-Malta. used
solely for, war purposes, according to
experience, until now.
"The commander of the- submarine
further ascertained that' there were
-Chinese in national costumes on the
steamer. He considered them to be
workmen soldiers. In spite of the clear
weather aijd^ careful observation he did
not perceive? any women and children.
"In these circumstances the- com
mander of the submarine was con
vinced he was concerned with a trans
porluship for troops In the service of
the British government, which is to be
considered as an auxiliary warship, ac
cording to International law. He ac
cordingly considered himself justified
in attacking the steamer without de
lay, and sank It.
"Should the American government
give the official data showing the
Arabia at the time of the sinking to
have been an ordinary passenger
steamer, the action of ttte submarine
commander would not have been in ac
cordance with instructions given him.
This would then be a case of regret
table mistake from which the German
government would promptly draw the
appropriate consequences."
