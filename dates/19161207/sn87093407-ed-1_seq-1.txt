There has been enough TALK about consolidating the Chamber of Commerce and Commercial Club. Why has there been no ACTION? Ona
reason is Secretary C. B. Yandell of the Chamber of Commerce the man who so conspicuously failed to come thru for Seattle in the tourist rate
fight. If ever there was a reason for the merger of the two commercial bodies, now is the time. But it can't be successful unless it is based upon
healthy, up-to-date, progressive, forward-looking ideas. The old mossback regime must go. Give us a LIVE commercial body, with a LIVE ex*
ecutive secretary.

Editor Star: The Star's "Million Dollar
Idea" it indeed all that its name implies! It's
great, timely and practical and the sugges
tion is in line with the progressive spirit and
The Star's keen interest in civic affairs. This
is indeed the psychological time to act. No
better Christmas present could we give our
selves than to consolidate the commercial
bodies and kindred organizations. It is nec
essary to do this first, and immediately to
bring ourselves into closer commercial rela
tionship, if we are to secure the results from
the elimination of the differential rate which
means so much to the entire Northwest. No
greater public service can The Star render
than by following up its "Million Dollar
Idea" —it's too good to be lost. Every effort
alMiaUft be mad* io secure ajn adequate ap
propriation from the legislature for state
wide advertising purposes and provision
should also be made for a substantial appro
priation from the city for the advertising of
Seattle as the great central point for tourists
to the Northwest.
If The Star would undertake a "follow
up campaign" with its characteristic energy
and aggressiveness, as represented in its
splendid victory in the rate case, there is no
question about the results. This is the time
for a quick, decisive, energetic and concen
trated action!

Indications Thursday were that-the four

Foot tracks indicated they had separat

The bloodhounds failed to follow the
