PLANTERS SEEK
HAWAIIAN SUGAR
Morning Session is Executive
But Discussion Early in the ,
Afternoon Important ;
Because refir.era have Ejected to
tha grace of Hawaiian sugar the .mem
bers of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters'
Association diacussed . what kind -Of
Sugar is wanted, and the best means
of attaining the! desired .quality, .R.
S. Nwris led the discussion with' his
report on "Properties' o.'. Hawaiian
Raw Sugars Which. Affect 73elr Re
fining Value, at the afternoon ' aes
sion. '. . '. - " "..
The quality of sugar wanted, accord
ing to members who talked with re
finers,, is an even,, harder grain and
with lees ash. Norria said the best
method was to increase the polariza
tion. Cuban and Porto Riea"h sugars
of the quality wanted by the refiners
were on exhibit. A M. Nowell said
that he believes that tha question of
polarization should not be considered
so much as the size and hardness of
the grains. "it was. pointed out by
Norris that the aih content had not
Increased during the past 20 years.
The members of the-Hawaiian Sug
ar Planters' Association held an ex
ecutive session this morning in their
rooms in the Bank of Hawaii build
ing for a discussion of various mat
ters which hive arisen during the
past year relative to the manage
ment of - the plantations, labor and
bonus problems, the growing of cane
and the manufacture of the sugar
and morns of improing conditions
were taken up and talked over. The
meeting was not opea to the public I
diek, the newly elected president of
the association, said that the commit
tees for the ensuing year would not
be chosen until some time' after the!
meeting.
This afternoon at 1:20 the members
again took up the dit-tussion of the1
reports, those remaining being, "Ware
houses and Storage of Raw Sugar,"
"Labor Savin? Devices," "Bagasse
Pulp and Paper" and "Forestry.":
New Discovery Wakes Interest
The new process, discovered by J,
N. S. Williams, of recovering sugar i
from final molasses, which up to this'
time was consicerea Impossible, a
report on which was read by- Willi
ams Wednesday afternoon at the
meeting of the association, Is caus
ing much comment today by local
business and sugar men as it is con
sidered one of the most important
finds of recent years." Its value' to
the sugar growers on this year's aver-
ca firurea Is oxer f 2 500.000 and an
the cost of machinery necessary for
its manufacture . is small, it is ex-(
pec ted that many of the plantations
will try it out as soon as possible.
The amount obtained is one and one
eighth per cent, which formerly was
believed absolutely lost
; The new process worked out by Wil
liams is to boil the final molasses: un
til it is practically free of water and
then remove the sucrose by a high
speed .centrifugal. This sucrose, the
report says, can then be converted in
to commercial sugar. :

JUDGE VATSON IS
0P1 QUESTION
Judge Ashf ord ; and Attorney
General Stainback Promi
nently Mentioned
A reported active movement among
members of the bar association look
ing toward the indorsement-1 f Attor
ney General I. M. Stainback as suc
cessor to Associate Justice E. M. Wat
son of the supreme court, it one of the
several developments today in the sit
uation preceding the filling of the
vacancy by the president ; !
Stainback Is in a receptive mood,,
as is also Circuit Judge C. W. Ash
ford, mentioned in local court circles
as the logical man for th bench.
Democrats are reported to . be boost
ing for Attorney Harry Irwin, former
ly of Hilo. Judge Arthur Wilder was
mentioned this morning as a tossible
candidate by one of the higher-ups of
the territorial government, as was
also Judge W. S. Edings . of MauL
In the opinion of many attorneys
and court officials. Judge Ashford - is
the logical man to succeed Justice
Watson. With 30 years' experience at
the bar and with more than two years
on the bench. Judge Ashforit may re
ceive the indorsement of the bar asso
ciation, say those who profess to
know. .His familiarity with local coa
ditions and with history that has been
made in the islands during the last
40 years is said to be one of the im
portant points in hb favor. .
Judge Ashford will accept the ap
pointment if it is offered him, he
modestly admitted today. Although
in a receptive mood, he asserted he
has made no personal endeavor to
ward securing, a promotion to the su
preme bench.
"I will not ask a msn to even vote
for me at the bar association," ho'con
tinued. "The members of the bar
know far better than I if I am cuali
fied for the supreme bench. After
having" been at the bar for :;0 years
and on the bench for more than two
years, the members, of the bar will
know whether I am qualified, whet'avt
I know It or not If the members of the
bar feel that I am qualified for the
position, they are at liberty , to say
so if they care to."
Attorney General Stainback sm.led
his morning when asked if be is a
candidate for the position of associate
justice. . " '
"I guess I am as much a candidate
as any of the rest of them," he said.
"I haven't applied for the position,
but I should probably accept it if of
fered to me."
Stainback has been in the islands
since 1912, coming here ust after fin
ishing his course of law at the Uni
versity of Chicago. He finished at
Princeton in 1907. If named for. the
place he would be one of the young
est attorneys ever named to a state
or territorial supreme bench. - .

4- Some Union:sts, like J. Austen 4

WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 7.
Germany's contentions by which that
government justifies the submarining
of the P. & O. liner Arabia, were made
public today by Secretary of State
Lansing.
The sinking of- the British liner
brings up a situation In which Ger
many has already asked the United
States for any Information as to the
status of the vessel, while it Is un
derstood that Washington has asked
Berlin for a statement of the circum
stances surrounding the sinking. V
Germany's contentions in brief are
that t h Arabia was a "trooD transport
in the service of the British, and con
I sldered an auxiliary warship, accord
ing to International law."
Secretary Lansing emphaslies, how
ever, that Germany's attitude Is one
of readiness to make amends la the
event that it Is shown that the com
mander of the submarine ' violated
Germany's pledge to the United
States
It Is understood that the United
States does not regard the circum
stances surrounding the sinking of the
liner to be such as the German note
recites as showing Justification for
