BACK TO SLAY A II. MY
London, Dec. fi. The fall of Bu
charest and Ploechtl, announced in
the German official communication
tonight, has heen confirmed, but the
position revcalej by the previous Ger
man and Russian communiques left
little hope that the Rumanian capital
could be saved.
The rapidity of the advance of the
central powers seems to show that no
attempt was made to defend the capi
tal and the actions fought have prob
ably been only of a delaying nature.
The fall of Ploechti, perhaps, is of
even greater importance than that of
Bucharest. Ploechti Is a railway junc
tion and the center of the great on
district of the Prahova valley. Unless
the Rumanians have been able to de
stroy or disable the oil wells, machin
ery and stores of oil- the Germans
will get a much-needed prize. More
over, in the Prahova valley they are
on the line of retreat of a portion
of the Rumanian second army.
It is believed that the Rumanians
will be compelled to retire until they

Chicago, Dec. 6. The right of the
members of the Tri-Ci'ty Central
Trades Council of East St. Louis to
nickel the nlant of the American Sleel
j foundries was upheld today by the
I'mted States circuit court of appei a,
in a decision reversing the 1'nited
States district rourt. The lower cov,'t
was ordered to modify its decree en
joining picketing and to enter in n -cordance
with the ruling of the upper
cou rt,
"The right to striko for higher
wages and improved conditions of
labor is too firmly established to ne
cessitate further elucidation," the de
cision said. "In the pursuit of a law
ful purpose to secure a raise in
wages, picketing may be employed as
this court has held, to ascertain whom
the late employer has persuaded or
attempted to persuade to accept em
ployment, and persuasion may be
used to induce them to refuse or quit
employment.
'I'ndoubtedly picketing and per
suasion would interfere with the
plaintiff's conduct of its business in
making it more difficult for them to
retain old employes and hire new
ones. Indeed, the very act of strik
ing often seriously interferes with that
free and unrestrained control of the
employer's business. But the lawful
ness of the strike is not to be tested
by such Incidental effect of it.
"The crder in the present case fails
to recognize this difference between
the lawful means of interfering with
another's business as an incident to
the party's own light and unlawful
means adopted by. .the sujne party.
"Methods may be considered lawful
even though the employers' business
is interfered with because such meth
ods are inci.lental to the right of the
employe, which right should be and is
recognized as equal to the right of the
employer."
The decision was handed down by
Justices Muck, Alschuler and Evans-

With the British Army in France,
Dec. 3, via London, Dec. 6 (From a
staff correspondent of the Associated
Press.) Winter, cold, gray and
bleak, lias held the western battle
front 1n its icy grasp for more than
a week now, and hag temporarily
checked any attempt on either side at
operations on a large scale. There
has been the usual daily "strafing," or
exchange of artillery fire, but the
shelling has been largely done by what
mariners would call "dead reckon
ing." Ixiw hanging, damp, leaden skies
have shrouded the land in gloomy
darkness, and observation has been
almost wholly impossible. For the
past seven days there has been a thick
mist, while on two occasions the war
zone has been completely curtained In
a mantle of heavy fog. Rut through
this gray murk the guns kept ham
mering away firing at the unseen
enemy harrassing post roads and
rail heads or any other "registered"
place where he was likely to be busy
with the multitudinous affairs of war
behind the lines.

A battle in tho fog and nearly
every detached engagement in this
struggle on the Somnie could be class
ed as a battle by ordinary standards
is n wieldly mysterious and uncanny
affair. A roar, a fla.sh of red flamo,
and out Into the leaden mist shrieks j
a shell on its well-intended mission of j
death and destruction. j
"This Is where it should fall," re
marks the gunners, as he points to n
map with a pair of compasses. "Wo
will put another just over here," and
hang goes the gun. In the deepness
of the fog the battle seems to shoot
Into a little drub world all its own. j
The Germans, however, have been
bombarding one of their recently Inst!
posit ions. It is a favorite occupation
of the German gunners this shelling j
a position they know so well, after I
they had been driven from it. And!
such "strafing" culls for a reply, even;

Such fighting as this makes war

Georgo has overthrown the Asquith
cabinet and will become prime mirv

will he coalition, like (ho old one, hut
probably without the same measure of
harmonious support, which attended
Ihe formation of (ho first coalition

This result has emerged from an
other day of tictlvo unci hurried party
conferences and a day of Intense sus
pense and Interest throughout tho
count ry.
There was a prospect this afternoon
that the personal offices of tho klni?
might solve the situation, and many
thought that the Asquith regime might
lie continued. The king called the
party leaders to Buckingham palace
and conferred with them for more
than an hour. Mr. Asquith and Mr.
Lloyd-George of the liberals, Mr.
Bonar Law and Mr. Balfour of tha
unionists, and Mr. Henderson of the
labor party, were with the sovereign.

It is many years since a British,
ruler assembled tho representative"!
of the different factions face to fa en
when they had showed themselves un
able to settle their differences. But
no sin h serious crisis has before
arisen to require such action by tho
king.

Afterwards, the king gave an audi

to undertake the formation of a new
ministry, and then to Mr. Lloyd

would, if the opportunity came to him.
