German Submarines off Island
Capital of Funchal
INHABITANTS FLEE FROM CITY
French Gunboat Sunk with Loss of 35
and Six Portuguese Sailors
Were Killed.
London, Dec. 6. German subma
rines raided Funchal, capital of the
island of Madeira, on Sunday. The
population, frightened, fled, and only
returned when the submarines depart
ed under an intense fire from the for
tress. The French gunboat Surpise was
sunk by the submarines. Thirty-four
of tho crew perished.
Six Portuguese sailors were killed
aboard the steamers Kanguroo and
Decia, which were torpedoed and sunk
The submarines shelled the shore
for two hours, especially the English
cable station and other public build
ings, but only small damage was done.
London, Dec. 6. The Crown Prince
mado today his first attack at Verdun
since the great French victory in Oc
tober. His troops fought their way in
to some of the French advanced
trenches near Lo Mori Homme, on the
west bank of the Meuse.
At 3.30 this afternoon the Gentian
infantry attacked, after an itense ar
tillery fire, on a French salient.
French machine guns raked the ad
vancing lines of German infantry,
causing heavy losses. Struggle as
they would, the Germans could not get
past the first line trenches. They
held only "some advanced elements"
when the night statement was issued
in Paris.
On the rest of the front In France
and Belgium there was more of the
apparently restless but aimless fight
ing of the past fortnight. 'Bolgiana
and Germans threw trench bombs in a
duel near Dixmude and Belgian and
German artillery were active on the
Vser. On the Sonime there was a
heavy bombardment, and the British
made more trench raids.
Paris, Dec. C. A fluctuating strug
gle is proceeding in southern Serbia,
where Serbs and French are attack
ing Germans and Hulgars defending a
strong line of mountain works with
great stubborness.
The Sorbs and French announced to
day that they are still pushing the
Hulgars hard. Northeast of Budi
mirtsa, near Gradesnitza, which is
east of the Cerna, the Serbs carried a
strongly fortified series of heights
which were stubbornly held The as
sault was brilliantly made, the Ser
bian statement says. The French
also tell of progress by French and
Serbs north of Paralovo.
A despatch to the London Times
from Salonica under Monday's date
says that tho Serbs were then driv
ing the Bulgars in continued re'tieat,
had crossed the River Gradesnitza
and had taken two more guns. A
Bulgar Colonel was found dead on the
field.
Tho German and Bulgar statements
say, however, that the Bulgars rallied
near Gradesnitza and drove them out
of tho newly conquered Bulgar posi
tions. JACK LONDON'S DAUGHTERS

OYD GEORGE NEW
PRIME
IISIER
Of ENGLAND
Will Organize Coalition Cabinet for
Great Britain
WILL COMPRISE TWO PARTIES
Laborites, Although Personally Op
posed, Have Agreed to Praticl- -pate
in Re-organization.
London, Dec. 7. It Is conceded that
tho new British ministry will be a
coalition eabitiet, comprising in Its
membership at least two of the larger
parties. No ono party would be able
to organize the change of government
because of lack of strength In the
house of commons.-
It Is recognized that tho greatest
difficulty confronting the new pre
mier, David Lloyd George, will be in
the selection of the personel of his
cabinet.
The members of the labor party
have reached an agreement to partici
pate in the reorganization.
1ondon, Dee. 7. David Lloyd
George has over-thrown the Asquith
cabinet and will become prime minis
ter of Great Brltlan himself. The new
government will bo coalition, like the
old one, but probably without the
same measure of harmonious support
which attended the formation of the
first coalition government, because its
birth has created additional factional
differences.
This result has emerged front anoth
er day of active and hurried party
conferences at London and a day of
intense suspense and interests
throughout the eouiitry.
Tho official announcement that Mr.
Lloyd-George had undertaken tho
task, with the co-operation of Mr.
Bonar Law, was a notification that the
new government would bo coalition.
Any party government would be im
possible because norther the unionists
nor the liberals have a majority in
the House of Commons; either ono
must attach the Irish nationalists or
the laborites to itself to command a
majority. Tho nationalists have re
fused to participate in the government
until home rule becomes established.
The laliorites are sworn e nemies to
Mr. Lloyd -George, because they resent
his accusations that the workinginen
have put their personal Interest
above the national iutere-sts at times
during tho war.
BERLIN'S BIG CLAIM
Russia's Losses, 8,500,000, Are Largest
France Second with 3,700,000
Berlin, Dec. 5, by wireless to Say
ville. Tho total losses of the entente
In the present war have beon 15.100,
(100 men. according to figures given
out by the Association for Research
Into tho Social Consequences of the
War of Copenhagen, as quoted in an
Overseas News Agency statement to
day. "Of this number," says tho news
agency summary of tho report, "Great
Britain has lost 1,200,000 men, Russia
8.500,000. France 3,700.000, Italy 800.
000, Serbia 480,000, Belgium 220,000
and Roumnnia 200,000.
"These figures admit of curious con
clusions. Thus, tho losses of Serbia,
Belgium and Roumania are three
quarters those of the British and as in
tho Roumanian losses only those of
tho first two months are included,
these three small nations have in
fact made sacrifices as large as those
of the groat British empire. Italy
has suffered already losses equal to
two-thirds of those of tho British, al
though she entered the war ten
months later than Great Britain. The
French losses are three times as
great as tho British and form almost
one-quarter of the total for the whole
entente, while tho Russian losses are
soven times greater than the British,
which compriso emly eight percent, of
the total although In them the losses
of the Canadians, Australians, New
Zealunders, South Africans, East In

SHORT WEIGHT IN BUTTER
Commissioner of Measures Finds
Ma"y Instanceaof Error.
Montpelier, Dec. 2. The biennial
report of the department of weights
and measures, tho first report to make
its appearance, has been issued and
contains some interesting data and
recommendations. i
Commissioner George E. Carpenter,
who succeeded Hugh H. Henry June
3, 1915, had but two inspectors work
ing for the department and he gives
briefly the field work of tho adminis
tration. He says that even with one
less Inspector the department accom
plished more actual work than the
year previous and the state was cov
ered more completely.
Among all records, continues the re
lort, short weight in butter occurs too
frequently, the moulds in use in many
creameries are too small and If a uni
form method of using proper moulds
can be obtained such shortages will
occur less often. A condensation of
daily reports develops the fact that,
out of 1,075 purchases of butter v hkh
the public might make at various
stores In the state, 309 of these pur
chases would not be up to ' standard
In weight, and 364 of them would be
overweight; that out of 284 like pur
chases of grain, the public would re
ceive full weight in 87 instances, and
would receive over-wegiht in 15 in
stances. The conclusion reached lu
this instance is surprising; 45 per
cent of miscellaneous commodities,
grain, and butter, were inaccurate In
weight.
The report Includes a table which
shows the number of places visited,
tests made and expenses and while
the number of places visited has In
creased from 3,500 In 1914-1915 with
four inspectors, to 5,556 In 1915-1916
with three Inspectors, an increase of
59 per cent, the cost a visit has de
creased from $2.96 to $1.52, a de-crease
of 49 per cent.
The commission reports that addi
tional offico room In needed and states
the departme'nt is not receiving suffi
cient co-operation from the public
to make the results as far-reaching as
they should be.
Tho commissioner recommends a
change In No. 161 of the acts of 1910
as amended by acta of 1912 and 1915
so that the commissioner may ap
point inspectors who shall be paid not
to exceed $1,000 a year; and the sal
ary of each to be determined by the
commissioner.
The commissioner also urge-s the
passage of the following law; "An
act relating to net contents of certain
packages, Section 1. No person shall
sell, keep, or offer for sale, within the
state, any article of food in package
form unless the net quality of the
contents shall be plainly, conspicuous
ly and correctly marked on the out
sldo of the package in terms of weight
measure or numerical count."
A penalty of $500 is provided for
violation, but it is so worked that no
penalty shall bo conforced arising
frcm the sale of food prepared prior
to one year alter the passago of the
law.
Snake' Method of Attack,
No snake is iiMe t,i jump or spring
from a ro'.l in order t xtrlke, as often
represented in pictures. It ran only
strike when It resembles the letter S
and is lying flat on the ground. It can
then only verii'U the distance supplied
by stretching the body out straight
The two ct'ives in the letter S supply
this distance, which Is about half thft.
length of the body. No snake jumps
through the air to its victim or springs '
clour from the ground, rising upon its
;ail. Such stories and pictures ore all .
false. Neither do they coil liken rope
and strike front that position. They
may coil partially, but the part of the.
body that does the striking is ever and
only that part which makes the letter
S and lies flat on the ground; henco no
serpent can strike when stretoned out
its full length.

OEMOCRACY URGED
BY BRYAN TO HELP
II
Advises Party to Take Up Cause
of Prohibition
WILSON WON WPHQIir "WETS"
Received Vote of All Prohibition and
States Which Had Granted
Woman Suffrage.
Washington, Dec. 6. William J.
Bryan tonight struck the first blow in
his fight to make the country dry. At
a dinner given him by Democrats of
the District of Columbia, he warmly
advocated prohibition 83 a Democratic
party policy.
"The Democratic party won without
the aid of the west cities," Mr. Bryan
said, "and having received the support
of nearly all the prohibition states and
the states whero women vote, is re
leased from any obligation to the
liquor traffic. It is free to take the
moral side of this great moral issue,
and I have no doubt that It will live
up to its opportunities and obliga
tions." After reviewing the accomplish
ments of the administration during its
first term, Mr. Bryan suggested sever
al lines along whlcht o work to effect
still more reforms. He urged strongly
against heading the plea of the rail
roads to be freed of state control,
with entire control to be placed in the
hands of congress and sounded a
warning against militarism.
"The United States cannot afford to
lose Its moral prestige," he declared,
"for the privilege of terrorizing people
with a display of force."
Mr. Bryan pointed out these needs
of the nation:
"A national bulletin to acquaint all
voters with the questions and issues
under consideration at an election.
Abolition of the electoral college
and substitution therefor of direct j
voting for President.
A change in the Constitution, mak
ing it more easily amendable so that I
control of either the president, the
senate or the house would not insure
defeat of a proposed amendment. Un
der the present system thirteen of the
smaller states, containing less than
one-tenth of the population of the
country, would be sufficient to prevent
adoption of a proposed amendment. .
Adoption of a suffrage policy by the
Democratic party, promising the Influ
ence of the party toward nation-wide
enfranchisement of women.
Returning to his "dry argument,'
Mr. Bryan declared the statement that
national prohibition is an assault up
on the rights of states has little
weight in the states where prohibition
has been adopted, and that this weight
would diminish as the number of pro
hibition states increase.
"The Democratic party is the party
of the people," the former secretary
declared, "and tho home is the peo
ple's citadel. The fight against the sa-'
loon is a fight for the home and for
humanity. The Democratic party,
therefore; can not hesitate to choose
tho homo against the greatest enemy
that has arisen to menace it."
President Wilson was unable to at
tend the dinner, but sent a letter of
greeting to Mr. Bryon through Oliver
P. Newman, commissioner of the Dis
trict of Columbia. As toastmaster, Mr.
Newman read the communication to
the diners. It follows:
"My dear Mr. Commissioner: Will
you not be kind enough to convey
my very cordial greetings to Mr.
Bryan and to those who are assem
bled to do him honor at the dinner
on Wednesday evening? In the re
cent camiwign no one rendered more
unselfish service than Mr. Bryan and
I am happy to know that this dinner
expresses the genuine admiration of
all Democrats for him. May I not by
this means convey to him my warmest
congratulations and best wishes for
his continued health and happiness?
"Cordially and sincerely yours,
"Woodrow Wilson."
Earlier in the day the President had
received Mr. and Mrs. Bryan at lunch
eon at tho White House, the first time
the former secretary of state had vis
ited the. executive mansion since re
signing his portfolio.

BUCHAREST TAKEN
BOI RUMANIANS
SAVED ARfflY
Retreat from Capital Claimed to
Have Been Made in Good Order
.
BRAYE DEFENCE BY REARGUARD
Fall of Bucharest Give Germans
Control of 50,000 Square Mile In
Rumania.
Paris, Dec. 7. The Rumanians
evacuated Bucharest in good order,
according to the announcement of tho
war office today, saving their army.
This is the first admission from an
allied government of the official an
nouncement from Berlin that the city
had been captured by the entente
powers. The Rumanian rear guard
was compelled to make a vigorous de
fence to protect the retreating Ru
manians. Berlin, by wireless to Sayvllle, Dec.
7. Bucharest, capital of Rumania,
has been captured. Ploechtl, the im
portant railway Junction town, 36
miles northwest of Bucharest, also has
been taken.
The capture of Ploechtl, on the
main railway line running north from
Bucharest, cuts the main railway line
of retreat for the Rumanian armies
operating in the Bucharest region.
The official statment does not indicate
whether the entry of the Teutonic
forces Into Bucharest and Ploechtl
was simultaneous. The capture of
Ploechtt before that of the capital
would be far more serious for the Ru
manians. Many military observers looked for
the Rumanians not to attempt a de
fense of the capital to the last, expect
ing an evacuation in time to save tbe
forces defending It by a withdrawal
over the railway route remaining to
them. The taking of Bucharest vir
tually completes the conque3t by the
Teutonic forces of the southern sec
tion of the Rumanian kingdom, em
bracing territory of more than 50,000
square miles.
In entering Rumania the armies of
the central powers have taken their
fourth entente capital. Early in the
war King Albert and the Belgian
government were forced out of Brus
sels, and last year King Peter of
Servia and King Nicholas of Monte
negro were successfully compelled to
give up their capitals to the Teutonic
invaders. Now the process has been
repeated in the case of King Ferdi
nand of Rumania.
Bucharest before the present war
relegated old-fashioned fortifications
to the scrap heap, and was considered
extremely well defended by its outly
ing works, which comprised 18 fortifi
cations of the first class and many re
doubts and batteries. Aside from
Paris, it was accounted probably the
largest military camp in tho world, .
capable of accommodating 200,000
men. Tho city, a gay capital in peace
times, with a population of nearly
300,000, was frequently alluded to as
"the Paris of the East" i It covers
an area in excess of 20 square miles,
contains the royal residence, the gov
ernment buildings and other notable
structures, and is the center of a con
siderable trade.
JURY IS EXCUSED
No Cases as Yet Heard by December
Term of County Court.
Judge Miles, who is president at the
present December term of Bennington
county court, Wednesday afternoon
excused the members of the petit
Jury until Monday.
Thus far it has been impossible to
begin the trials of any of the Jury
cases for the reason that State's At
