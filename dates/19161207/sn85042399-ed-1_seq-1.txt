Chief of Police

In order that he may not be
obliged to hold over after January
1, when he expects to tane up other
work, Chlet of Police Porter handed
In his resignation to the city council
Tuesday evening, to take effect Janu
ary 1. Included In his resignation
was an expression of appreciation for Messrs. Banta and Krohbach were ap
the co-operation and gooci-will of the pointed a committee to have a char
council In the 'past and an appeal for ter amendment drawn which would
the same aid and recognizance for the clarify the power of the council to
new police department head, no mat
ter whom It may be.
Duriug the time that Mr. Porter
lias headed the Ashland police depart
ment, that branch of tlie city govern
ment has made a fine record and has
been raised to a much higher stand
ard than ever before. M: Porter has
Insisted upon a most exact system
and has allowed no laxity In appear-
ance or conformation to rules among
the police department. He has built
up a force which has gained the re
spect of the entire city and has kept
the city In such a way that there Is
not a cleaner municipality In Oregon
if anywhere. Mr. Porter Installed a
system of reports which makes it pos
sible for any of the patrolmen to ac
count for their presence at any par
ticular point at any time and which
has proven Invaluable in several
cases. .The police records of the city
for the pafct four years arj most com
plete and will be valued by Mr. Pot
ter's successor.
Will Establish
Billiard Parlors
Hum Pracht and Joe Alnutt are
preparing to open up billiard parlors
In the quarters in the Elks temple
vacated by McGee's Btore. Messrs.
Pracht and Alnutt recently returned
from San Francisco where they se
lected the very latest In tables and
equipment and the new establish
ment is to be fitted up In big city
style.
Both of these genetlemen have had
considerable experience along like
business lines and should make a suc
cess of the latest addition to Ash
land's places of amusement. Mr. Al
nutt's cigar factory which manufac
tures the Llthla, Tlsit, La Valencia
and other well known brands of cig
ars, will be established in the rear
f the billiard hall.

To Amendment
(Forum)
To the Voters of Ashland, Ore.:
I will rsk every citizen of Ashland
to stop and ponder well before exer
cising their right of franchise on the
lftth Ins.., and to also look well Into
the future, and at the same time re
fer to the past, before casting votes
for the proposed charter amendment,
whereby they will place the care and
control of our city parks In the hands
of the common council. This pro
posed change emanates from mem
bers of the present board, whereby
they propose to Increase their pow
ers, which are at present almost be
yond the will or wishes of the ma
jority of the voters.
If you ponder over the past, only
go back two years and see what re
spect the common council have for
the wishes of the people. The elec
tric light contract for one, which was
voted down by a large majority of
the voters, and then a time lease was
consummated In executive session
and brought forth and passed, there
by giving us' a lemon.
We all concede that our parks are
one of our principal assets and
should be maintained in proper man
ner in future, and the caretakers
should be composed of the best ma
terial In the city.
Do you stop to remember that no
surveyor or any other artisan will
follow out the plans of a predeces
sor? Then just Imagine what will
become of the present beautiful park,
have no appointive authority as the
present charter reads, but must ac
cede to his demands, and the new
man reconstructs the park to suit his
inclinations and you, Mr. Voter, will
be powerless to remedy that evil.
Why not let the park board con
tinue in charge, who have used their
best enedavors'ln the past and have
a future planned in harmony with
the present surroundings?
While amending the city charter,
why not so change it as to place the
appointive power in the hands of the
council as a body, with nominating
and elective power In a majority of
the council?
Before voting the authority to
grant franchise for the use of city
waters, why not have a requirement
that the grantees shall erect, main
tain and operate said sanitarium 365
days In the year and, if not so done,
franchise to terminate immediately?
The foregoing is only a few of the
futures as seen through the glasses
of a voter, if you vote yes to the pro
posed placing care of the parks in
the common council.

stated that he believed many people
In the city were in favo; of putting
an end to one of the commissions but
not both, and moved that the meas

Some argument as to tho legality of

He has planned many of the water

the head of the Blmlna baths at Los
Angeles. He left Tuesday night for
San Francisco, where he will meet
with investors interested In Ashland.
It was hoped to have a meeting of
citizens last night to be addressed by
Dr. Tape, but on account of the short
ness of time in which to publish It
and the number of other attractions
on for last night, It was thought best
not to attempt it. However, Dr. Tape
will probably be again In Ashland in
a month or so, at which time a meet-

given an opportunity to hear a good
talk upon a subject in which they are
much interested and one in which the
doctor is acknowledged to be the best

Fred Gets Another
Fine Wolfhound
Fred Ilerrin Tuesday received an
other fine Kussinn wolfhound from
Williani3, Cal. The great lank beast
stands about four feet tall and six
feet in length, while a mlllmeter rule
would be necessary to ascertain his
beam, which approaches zero at the
spot where dogs are usually the wid
est. The hound is a thoroughbred
and was secured for Fred by his
brother. The male of the original
pair which Fred purchased from the
owner at the San Francisco exposi
tion, where they captured all prizes,
died from some kind of malady soon
after arriving here. A fine lot of
puppies, themselves monster dogs,
are penned up over on the Hefrln
ranch. The original pair cost 300
and the puppies are nearly all sold at
$75 apiece.

V. A. Pinion, caretaker at Moun

Mr. Pinion asked permission to delve
, for precious metal upon the property
j which is owned by the city, and

handed in to the council. Mr. Ninln
ger either knew not, or pretended
that he knew not, regarding the ex

Pinion o::pects to chip gold off, and
anxious Inquiries from nil the coun
cilmen failed to locate the location.
Finally the council granted the per
mission with provisions that the pros

At Yining Theatre
The Thursday attraction at tho

duction with Enid Markey vying with
Warner for the starship honors.
"Shell 43" Is a unique narrative of
cunning In the Europeun war. It
concerns the adventures of a young
man of mystery who possesses papers
which prove him to be the corre
spondent of a big American newspa
per, others establishing him as a Ger
man secret service agent, and still
others vouching for his commission
as a lieutenant in the English' army.
The secret of his mission Is not di
