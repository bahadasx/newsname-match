"Show folks" conveyed an impression
of coarse loud talking hard drinking
specim&ns of humanity very amusing
behind the footlights but to be avoided
in private life. Unfortunasely in the
past some individuals merited such
opinion. Bnt conditions ideas method
and people change with the times and
among them all it would be hard to
find a more unobtrusive gentlemanly
appeared chap than this same Charlie
of the Fun Folks in any line of busi
ness, In fact manager Joe Coburn is
as proud of the genteel quality and
appearence of his company off the
stage as of their ability on, and quickly
eliminates any exception to this rule.
Mr. Gano has surpassed all his fojmer
efforts in this seasons Millionaire Hunt
Club in India, as well as the comedy
numbers and topical farce which closes
the big show "Darktowns Prepared
ness Recruits" which is a hit and a
scream. Don't miss them at the
