CHICAGO A systematic
test on efficiency of a -group
of men forty-five to sixty-five
working along side of young
men was begun today by a
committee of fifteen large em
ployers, headed by Benjamin
J. Rosenthal, who claimed he
tested young men and old, in
his wrapping department re
cently and found that the old
men equalled, sometimes ex
celled the young. Twenty ap
plicants are being selected
from hundreds to be started
in the correspondence divis
ion of a large firm. The same'
work: will oe given an equal
number of vouns men and
will be paid in exact propor
tion for the work done.
ON THE WAR FRONT
The Teutons are continuing a
roundup of Rumanians. A

men, 26 guns. Seemingly
the -Rumanians are sill re

a stand until they reach the
Bezeu river, where there is
a strong defensive line in
touch with Russian Rein

(BY THE CITY EDITOR.)
The work on the new county rock
road over the mesa sixteen miles south
is progressing past the store of the
Yuma Supply Company on Fourth
Avenue, Yuma Heights today. The
people of the mesa are greatly encour
aged by these improvements and the
feeling is that other improvements of
a public and private character will
result.
C. M. White of the Yuma Supply
Company is home from Beaumont, Cal.,
where he went last Saturday night to
confer with Mr. Halladay of the same
firm regarding the extensive improve
ments being made at the company
store. A. H. Kent, who last summer
purchased a heavy interest in the com
pany, from Mr. Halladay, the largest
stockholder, has sold out to Mr. White,
who has been identified with the Yu
ma Supply Company since its organiza
tion. The company is prosperous and in
the new Yuma, which is fast approach-
ing, will be in the swim. All of which
calls to mind the fact that the Yuma
of ancient days will soon be history on
ly, and a modern city wil have taken
its place.
The reorganized company will carry
a larger line of goods and expect to
command a larger trade with the Val
ley farmers.
John Gandolfo, who is grading tiie
big hill in front of his home at Sec
ond avenue and Court street, has
struck oil, at least the indications are
there; also the smell, and Mr. Gan
dolfo states to the Examiner that if
he finds oil there in sufficient quan
tities he will go into the oil business,
instead of erecting a business block, a
hotel or anything else.
Mr. Gandolfo, who is one of Yuma's
largest and most progressive caital
ists, seems very optimistic over the
prospects for oil.
It is proposed to pave Court street
from Main to the court house and
Second avenue, to connect with the
Warrenite road at Eighth, because the
county will join in the cost of paving
the streets rurrounding the court
house and greatly add to the improve
ments. Let the good work go on.
The Yuma Electric & Gas Company

manent pipes all over the down town
district, which will greatly help the
If we have understood the;margin would be wiPed out-
tt r; C T But would tne governor accept an
Hon. bUgene b. Ives, COUn-joffice by an interpretation by the
sel for Governor Hunt in the,courts which would thwart the win of
coming contest, aright, we do
not believe there is a ground
for' a contest. It has been,
and is, the theory of the Ex
aminer that when the margin
is so close in so large a vote
as was cast at the late election
o rnn tocf to urorrnntorl J li o'
wmwi io wumv,u
aparently defeated candidate,
has reason for believing that
some votes were counted that
ought not to have been count
ed and that some votes were
rejected which ought to have
been counted.
Mr: Ives, however, disclaims an
such grounds for a contest. No charges
of fraud anywhere are made and no
irregularities are being alleged. The
whole vote of the state, every ballot,,
is to be recounted. That is, without
assuming, without even suspecting,
but only blindly hoping that some er
rors will be found to have been, made
agaibst the governor in the officia.1
count, another count is to be asked
for. All the Democratic election
boards in tne gtate and almost aU of
them were Democratic, may have made
enough mistakes to have deprived the
governor, the so-called. Democratic can
didate, of the election. It was never
contemplated that an election contest
should be based on such grounds.
Mr. Ives, however, says further, that
he is confident that before the recount
of the Maricopa vote' is completed it
will be found that enough votes would
have been taken from Mr. Campbell
to insure the re-election of Governor
Hunt. Yet no fraud or irregularities
are charged. ' Then, where is it ex
pected that these changes will occur,
unless it be among those Daiiots on
which voters marked a cross at the
head of the Democratic ticket and a
cross after the name of Mr. Campbell?
If all such ballots should be rejected
or so interpreted that they could not
count fo Mr. Campbell, his narrow
city fathers to hasten the paving of
the city's streets, the first of which is
Main street.
The stupendo s building scheme re
cently undertaken by E. F. Sangui
netti, opposite hs present large store,
when completed will add greatly to the
beauty of the city and provide Yuma
with a modern merchandizing einpor
ing unequealed in the Southwest. Mr.
Sanguinetti never does anything by
halves.

the people whom he has so dearly
loved and' to whose judgment he has
always expressed so great a willing
ness to bow?
We think not, unless the events of
November 7 have been enlightening
to the governor and have taught him
that' the judgment of the people is not
a thing to be trusted; that after all the
sheet-anchor of the country and its
institutions is in the formerly despised
and distrusted courts,
CONSUMERS RISE

The great army of food
speculators and middlemen
which has advanced the price
of staple necessaries of life to
an unprecedented extent was
near its Waterloo when the
sun went down last Wednes
day night in several cities.
The men who intervene be
tween the producer and the
consumer of fod products
were endeavoring to extort
from both all that the traffic
would bear.
Even in products in which there
was not an actual shortage in pro
duction, the speculators, cold-storage
men and middlemen made the retail
prices practically prohibitory to the
average householder. In some in
stances producers mindful of the folly
of killing the goose that lays the gold
eng eggs, contracted, the fever of avar
ice, and nearly did if not quite double
the usual prices of commodities. Then
came the deluge. .
Almost like an army responding to
the orders of its qommanding officer,
the consumers all over the country
rose in wrath and exasperation and
struck at the Thanksgiving turkey as
the nearest and most convenient target
in sight. The boycott extended to eggs
and other concomitants of the Thanks
giving feast. It was not confined to
any parUcular locality, but was ap
plied simultaneously in most of the
large cities. As the result, producers,
middlemen and retail distributors were
confronted with a non-purchasing pub
lic. Hundreds of thousands of fami
lies voluntarily deprived Uiemselves
of certain holiday luxuries in the in
