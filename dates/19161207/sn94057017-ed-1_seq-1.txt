bile to travel in.
J. J. White of Mountainair
came over Monday and shipped
out three cars of beans which he
had bought of growers in this
vicinity. He has two more cars
on hand to ship from here.
John Block says he did pretty
well in bean raising this season.
His old ground that is, ground
that had been continuously
farmed for several years, yielded
1,100 pounds to the acre. The
ground that had been growing
to weeds several years yielded
only 500 to 700 pounds. In other
words, Mr. Block'got off of his
clean ground above $75 per acre,
and from the foul ground $35 to
$50.
The Milbourns were delivering
their beans the first of the week,
having sold at $7.30. They were
hauling with the tractor, bring
ing 8,000 pounds per trip. They
were in a dry streak this year
got a very light rainfall and so
their crop was not a good one for
this year. Their 85 acres made
a yield of 750 pounds to the acre
61,750 pounds in all. But
even at this, their bean crop
brought them $54.75 an acre,
which isn't so bad.
C. P. May brought in a jag of
white beans yesterday fifteen
sacks that brought him $135.00.
He got 9c a pound for them. His
bean crop was poor this year.
The cut worms, the flea beetles
and the ladybird beetles each
took a whack at it, and he had
but 13,000 pounds. The high
prices will compensate some
what, though, as he will get just
about $1,000 for his beans. He
had a fine corn crop.
W. T. Cosand of Haviland,
Kansas, who owns land in, the
Estancia Valley, in a letter to the
News-Herald, among other
things has the following to say:
"I do not know of a section of
the country now, where land is
producing the returns that some
of it is there, that can be bought
at the prices prevailing there. I
am aware that the past season
has been very favorable for crops
generally and that prices are the
best ever, but will say I believe
a good per cent of your land
there would, if scientifically
farmed, bring a better revenue
per acre than can possibly be ob
tained from land hera which is
rated at $40 to $60 per acre. I
am figuring and scheming to the
best of my ability to get loose
here so I can locate out there,
and am fully expectinz to make
it within another year, altho
may have to make some sacrifice
that I do not like to Wheat was
a fair crop here this year, but
corn almost a failure. I am
planning and hoping to be a val
ley farmer soon."
J. P. Dunlavy was here last
week on business. He is now
located at Trinidad, Colorado.
He took an active part in politics
during the recent campaign, and
after the first of the year will be
office deputy in the sheriff's of
fice at Trinidad.
Pinto beans went to $7.40 last
week in Estancia.
L. M. Clark was over from
Encino last Friday.
A. R. Cecil was over from
Palma last week attending court.
An item in last week's paper
stated that the room north of the
postoffice is being fitted up to re
ceive the Romero stock of dry
goods. It is the room south of
the postoffice.
Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Harper, a
young couple of Elk City, Okla
homa, came Thursday of last
week and will remain for a time
at least, to try the climate for
Mr. Harper's health.
Mrs. Gunter of Socorro, who
had been visiting her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Hays, re
turned to her home last Satur
day. She was accompanied by
her brother, Henry Hays, who
will attend the School of Mines.
A ball was given Monday
night at Goodin hall in honor of
District Attorney Hamilton and
family. A very pleasant time is
reported. The attendance was
larger than at any dance given
in Estancia for a long time, and
all present enjoyed themselves
to the utmost. Mr. and Mrs.
Hamilton and their sons Wayne
were guests during their stay of
Dr. and Mrs. Ewing, and were
entertained also by Mr. and Mrs.
Elgin, Mr. and Mrs. Allan Mac
Gillivray, lr. and Mrs. Berk
shire, Mrs. Rhoda Evans, and

The pile of money in the coun
ty continues to grow. Last week
we stated the probability that the
deposits in the two banks of the
county amounted to $400,000.
The official report of the Tor
rance County Savings Bank at
Willard shows the deposits in that
bank on November 17th in round
figures $189,000. This is un
doubtedly materially increased
by this time. The books
of the 'Estancia Savings
Bank yesterday showed deposits
in round figures of $212,000, with
drafts in course of collection for
seven cars of beans amounting to
$19,000. The real deposits at
this date must amount to at least
$425,000.
Fred H. McBride, who Tias
been an agent in various capaci
ties for the D. & R. G. railway
and the New Mexico Central for
the past 25 years, ha3 been pro
moted to the post of general
freight and passenger agent of
the New Mexico Central with of
fices in the Catron block, east
side of the plaza. For the past
few years he served as joint
agent for the New Mexico Cen
tral and D. & R. G. at Union de
pot. His successor in that office
is Frank B. McBride who has
been cashier and operator. H.
H. Adams, of Del Norte, Colo.,
will temporarily fill the post va
cated by Frank McBride. New
Mexican.

Meador & Co.
F. A. Davis, who lives north
west of Willard, recently de
livered a car of beans of his own
raising 41,000 pounds at that
station for shipment. He has
more beans to sell. Not many
beans are shipped from Willard,
and in our report three weeks
ago of the number of cars
shipped out of the county, no
shipments from Willard were in
cluded. Mr. Davis thinks six or
eight cars have been shipped from
there. When the beans are prac
tically cleaned up, we will try to
get the figures and include the
Willard shipments. Our report
three weeks ago of 118 cars
shipped out to that date was
short whatever had been shipped
from Willard. It is now certain
that our estimate on that date of
fifty cars yet to ship, was short.
A case of very general interest
decided by Judge Medler this
week was that of Vanderford vs.
Wagner. Corn and cane belong
ing to the plaintiff were de
stroyed by the stock of the de
fendant. The proof showed the
amount of crop destroyed, that
the plaintiff had two wires
around part of his place and one
wire around part; that the
plaintiff had served notice upon
defendant that his stock were
destroying crops of the plaintiff
and that he would sue for dam
age if the stock was not kept
away. The court held that after
such notice it was incumbent up
on the stock owner to keep same
off the crops, , and that having
failed to do so, the trespass was
willful and he was therefore li
able for the proven damages.
Judgment was given accordingly.
The case of Olgin vs. Lucas, the
same kind of a case, was decided
a few days later and the plaintiff
given judgment for the ascer
tained damage.

he still owns.
Here is a bean story which we
got from Walter Pace, who
threshed the beans: Holliday
and Maxey, about ten mires
southwest, had fifteen acres that
made 1,900 pounds to the acre.
They sold some time ago at $6.30,
which made $119.70 an acre.
Beans have sold as high as $7.40.
If these beans had been sold at
the high figure they would have
brought $140.60 an acre. This is
the highest yield so far reported.
The next highest is a yield of
1,700 pounds per acre on ten
acres near Mountainair.

Catarrhal deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, aa they cannot reach
the dtscastd portion of the ear. There la
only one way to cure catarrhal aeaincsa,
and that la by a constitutional remedy.
Catarrhal Deafness Is caused by an In
flamed condition of the muoous lining- of
the Eustachian Tube. When this tube is
Inflamed you have a rumbling sound or Im
perfect hearing, and when it Is entirely
closed, Deafness Is the result. Unless ths
Inflammation can be reduced and this tube
restored to Its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever, klany cases of
deafness are caused by catarrh. Which la
an Inflamed condition of the mucoua sur
faces Hall'a Catarrh Medicine acta thru
the blood on the mucoua surface of th
system.
We will give One Hundred Dollars for
any case of Catarrhal Deafness that cannot
be cured by Hall's Catarrh Medicina. Cir

anybody could sell bods, but it required a good
