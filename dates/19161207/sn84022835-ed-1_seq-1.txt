Will Change Locations
It is with much pleasure that we
note some of our ineienaut'.s business
has iuct eared to Mich an extent that,
they h-tvo been compelled to seek
largcM' qtuuters, as lids is positive
proof that meichaudise of the better
quality, sold at moderate prices and
handled by competent business men,
will be purchased by the public.
The tlrst business firm to make a
change will be R. P. Weesncr &, Co.,
who will move into the building that
for a number of yeuts had been oc
cupied by the Miner Dros. Co. Exten
sive improvements will be made on
this building, iuoludlng a new metro
politan front. The interior will be re
aranged in a mnuner-more suitable for,
the displuy of merchandise.
Mr. Geo W. Trine, our genial hutd.
ware deuler, will move his stock of
hardware into the building now oc
cupied by R. P. Weesner & Co. George
informs us that his prebeut quarters
do not permit him to carry as complete
a stock'as his busines warrants, but
after he has located himself in his new
quarters he will carry a line of hard
ware that will be becond to none In
this vicinity.
It is albO rumored that John Yost,
who caters to the people at the Fourth
Avenue Meat Market, is contemplating
a change In location, as at times he
lias felt the need of more room, in
order to properly attend to the wants
of his increasing trude. The location
he has in view is the building which
Mr. Trine will vacate.
All of these business lit ins have
"mada good" in Red Cloud, as may be
seen by their desire for larger quarters.
This is indeed very enoonragiug and it
speaks well for tho ability of the mer
chants and the loyalty, to the home
merchant, of the people of this city
and vicinity. Let us hope this loyalty
will continue, yes, even increase, for
if tho people stand by their merchants,
tho merchants will do all in their pow-
1 er to advance 'the towu, so that you
may, at all times, feel proud of the fact
that you contributed your blmre to
ward the cause, that of making Red
I Cloud the best town of its size in this
mnu 01 peace ami prosperity.
