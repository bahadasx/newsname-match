CENTRAL CONTROL
General Break Down of Pow
ers of Individual States
Would Result.
Ii.tern itiiii.il News Smiro:
WASHINGTON, Iec. 7. Whole
sale political corruption with a gen
eral breaking down of the powers of
the individual states were predicted
by William Jennings Bryan today as
the "inevitable result" of the plan
of the railroads to centralize al
railroad control in the federal gov
ernment. Testifying before the joint
congressional committee investigat
ing railroad conditions, the former
secretary of state declared that re
sults of the railroad proposal would
inclu de:
"The injection into national poli
tics of a greater corruptive force
than we have ever known before.
"The removal of regulation to the
national capital and the consequent
dilticulty the people would find in
controlling their representatives.
"The obliteration of the state
lines and the consequent evil cen
tralization of power."
Mr. Bryan said that the proposed
federal incorporation of the rail
roads would saddle an enormous
governmental machinery on the
country. The plan, he said, was
bound to be a failure and would
"make government ownership in
evitable." The witness said that he did not
desiie government ownership and
would prefer to try in every way to
make private ownership vi the rail
roads effective.
"This plan of exclusive federal
control," he said, "would build up
an enormous federal bureau, with a
great number f ollicials, and the
democrat believes that society i
built up from the bottom; the aris
tocrat that society is suspended
from the top. I am a democrat."
