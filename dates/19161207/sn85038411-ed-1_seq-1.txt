With Bucharest lost to them
the Rumanians are retiring all
along the line in the province of
Wallachia, fighting rear guard
actions as they retreat.
The main point of interest that
remains of this campaign is the
fate of the Rumanian armies and
apparently there has been no
wholesale bag of prisoners as yet,
at least, by Field Marshal Von
Mackensen's troops, although
Berlin records the capture of
more than 9,000 men yesterday.

DIFFICULTIES OF NEWSPAPER
PUBLISHERS INCREASING
William P. Goodspeed, business man
ager of the Buffalo Evening News and
president of the Buffalo Ad Club, was
the guest of honor and principal speak
er at a luncheon of the Hamilton (Ont.)
Ad Club a few days ago.
Mr. Goodspeed predicted that owing
to the increase in the cost of white pa
per the time was not far distant when
every newspaper published in America
would not be sold for less than five
cents a copy.
The South Carolina Press Associa
tion at a recent meeting to discuss the
paper situation, decided to increase ad
vertising and subscription rates. A
statement from the association was
printed in all the newspapers of the
State, informing readers and advertis
ers of the decision and calling upon
them for continued support.
"To say that the news print situa
tion has reached a crucial period, ob
serves the Editor and Publisher, Is to
sum up recent development dispassion
ately. Those news print manufacturers
who sell the bulk of their output on
annual contracts with publishers are
now considering the vital question of
what the price shall be under contract
renewals. These manufacturers have
come to the parting of the ways."

Harrisburg Railways May Take

Up to City
Jitneys must have state certificates

to-day by Chairman Ainey, of the Pub
lic Service Commission, in ruling on
a test case in the series of complaints
filed by the Wllkes-Barre Railway
Company against Jitneymen operating
in its district. The opinion is the
! fourth in the series of jitney decisions.
In the Seranton and Pittsburgh cases
the commission held that Jitneys are
common carriers and must obtain state
certificates before operating; in the
Allegheny Valley cases decided yester
i day the commission held that not only
must Jitneymen get certificates, but
that they must satisfy the commission
that they have adequate and safe
equipment to meet the public needs,
and in (he Wilkes-Barre case it is held
that the ordinance passed by cities
under the motor vehicle "regulator" of
last year do not conflict with or in any
way restrict the outhority of the state
under the public service law of 1913.
The opinion is a very strong asser
tion of the view that the commission
has the power to require jitney owners

Horse Palls One Way, Cow
Tied to Buggy Another;
Woman Is Near Death
A horse pulling in front, a cow pull
ing behind, and a gentle push from a
northbound freight on the Northern
Central at Fishing Creek crossing
proved an unlucky combination for
| Mrs. John Fisher yesterday afternoon.
Mrs. Fisher was on her way to Har
risburg with a sturdy farm gray
hitched to the family spring wagon.
A brindle cow was tied to the rear and
cows never did like to be pulled be
hind a wagon.
When they attempted to cross below
Heckton, the cow decided it was a
good time to remonstrate with the
chafing rope about her neck. The
horse, of course, attempted to settle
the argument by plodding along. All
| might have been amicaoly settled ex
cept for the inopportune arrival of the
freight.
Mrs. Fisher not caring to stay for
the decision Jumped from the wagon
in time to escape with slight injuries.
The horse was hit, hut will live to
"cuss" the cow.

PREMIER PICKING
CABINET THAT
WILL BE BACKED
Lloyd George Hopes to Choose
Body Supported by House i
of Commons
I
SEEK LABOR APPROVAL
Unionists and Liberals in Line;
Churchill Slated For ,
High Post
London, Dec. 7. lt having been
decided definitely that David Lloyd
George will undertake the formation
of a ministry, political circles to-day
were interested chiefly in the person
nel of the new cabinet and the pros
pects of the. new premier for getting
together a combination that will have
the support of a majority in the
House of Commons. Few if any of the
Liberal members of Mr. Asquith's
cabinet are likely to accept office un
der Lloyd George and some of the
Unionist members like J. Austen
Chamberlain and Lord Robert Cecil
are likely to stand aside. However,
it is assumed that at the conference at
Buckingham Palace they assured the
new premier of their benevolent
neutrality, thus making his task much
simpler.
Provincial Liberal newspapers like
the Manchester Guardian and the
Liverpool Post make a plea to the
Liberals to give the government a fair
chance, as it is generally assumed
that it is the embodiment of British
determination to win the war. Ac
cording to one estimate, Mr. Lloyd
George can rely on the support of
virtually all the Unionist members and
of 70 Liberals and hopes to obtain
the backing of the Labor members
who will come to a final decision at!
a meeting to-day. It is also represent
ed that Mr. Lloyd George believes he j
will be able to offer concessions to the
Nationalists which will bring them into
line.
Has Nucleus Already
As far as the cabinet is concerned
the new premier has a nucleus in A.
Bonar Law, Lord Derby, Lord Cur
zon, Sir Frederick E. Smith and Sir
Edward Carson, while Viscount Head
ing, the Lord Chief Justice, is likely
to join the ministry.
Other Liberal members may be
drawn front men such as Sir Frederick 1

is expressed to be one of readiness to
make amends if It be shown that the

GROSS SAYS HE
WILL ASK $5,000
FOR BATHHOUSE
Park Commissioner Incor
porated Item in Tentative
Budget For 1017
HARGEST'S ISLAND SITE ?
Navy's Move For Swimming
Beach Will Be Followed
Up; Other Plans
At least $5,000 for a municipal bath
house and bathing beach on Hargest's
Island will be incorporated in the ten
tative draft of the Park Department
budget for 1917, according to City
Commissioner E. Z. Gross.
The plan in brief is to erect a mod
ern bathhouse of a type which will
permit the addition of wings and ex
tensions year by year as the demand
for increased facilities and the city's
purse will allow.
Whether or not the structure will
be erected in the little grove along the
east bank of the island between the
Market and Walnut street bridges,
near the northern point above the fil
ter plant, south of the Market street
bridge or on the western shore of the
Island, is a phase of the problem that
is yet to be decided. It Is understood,
however, that at the point selected a
certain amount of dredging will be
necessary to provide proper swimming
depths.
Respond to Navy Demand
The $5,000 item is to be put Into
the budget in response to the general
demand for adequate bathing facill
j ties, a movement which was organized
i and brought to a head by the Greater
I Harrisburg Navy, the city's big body
1 of canoeists, motorboatmen, swimmers
; and others interested in the permanent
j development of the Susquehanna river
I basin.
If (he money is provided Thomas M.
! Kelker, the chairman of a committee
! selected by the Navy to prepare tenta
tive plans and estimates of cost for a
] bathhouse that can be built on the
unit plan, will likely be instructed to
j get busy so that bids can be asked for
j and the contract let early in the year.

Just how much will be asked for
1 the entire department is a matter of
conjecture as yet, although it is ex-
I pected that Mr. Gross will have his
