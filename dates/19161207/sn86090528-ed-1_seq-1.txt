I THE GRIDIRON I
1.
(To C. H. S. team of HUG, by Byron Hester.)
There'll be no "Interference" in the game you pluy in life.
For each fellow'll have HIS eye upui the goal.
Nor will he be a cat's-paw just that YOU may win the strife,
Hi t he'll . f f lit for self with might and main and soul.
There'll bo no "Interference" just between you and the goal
To dear the way for YOU to hit the grit;
For each fellow'll want the pig skin; he will want the bug o' dough,
And it YOU get it, you will have to GO for it.
No accommodatiii' center will pass to you tho ball,
No quarterback will signal when 'tis thrown;
Nor will they go behind and push just like a human wall,
But unaided you must play the game alone.
No brilliant play of team work will be seen upon the field,
But a team work of YOUR powers there must be,
An alertness of the intellect, a body always steeled,
A will to act as promptly as to see.
Life's game Is hard and snappy, and if a fellow has the grit.
He may run between the goal posts by and by;
But it takes a scrappin spirit, and It takes a little wit,
And an eagerness to fight it out or die.
You may meet a flying tackle that Just sprawls you In a pile.
And makes you see the solar system in a flash;
Have the pig-skin taken from you down the field about a mile;
So your stock may drop to thirty cents in cash.
But you're not playing for the pig-skin; you're playing for the game.
So do not let a scrub fill in your place.
If you're losin' or winnln' it matters just the samo.
So up, and show the demon In your face.
Yes, show the scrappin' spirit; it's neither here nor there,
If there's not a single touchdown to your name.
The Referee lias declared It that the man who fair and squaro
Puts up a struggle Is the man who wins the game.
When Father Time has blown the whistle we will have a spook brigade,
When at last the hard fought game of life Is done.
In the might of death that follows we will all go on parade
To celebrate the game that we have won.

BIG FIGHT WILL BE IN
HOUSE OF COMMONS
Belief that Welch Statesman Will Limit
War Council to Five Members
Despite Opposition
3y United Prci.
London, Dee. 7. The supreme
question In England today was wheth
er David Lloyd George would succeed
in forming a i-ublnet. In the way
stood tho bitterness displayed by
friends of tho old regime in yester
day's refusal to servo under Bonar
Law and the same obstacle Is now
faced by Lloyd-George.
Those familiar with the courage, de-.
termination and personal magnetism
of Lloyd-George believed him to be
able to sin-mount all difficulties. The
chief difficulty lies in lining up sup
port In tho house of commons. It is
believed that tho Welch statesman
will limit his war council to five mem
bers. Additional iiiterest is lent to the re
construction of th Kovernment by dis
patches from Paris, Indicating secret
sessions of the chamber of deputies of
Franco for greater efficiency, more
aggressiveness and a more compact
organization for the conduct of the
war.
The house of commons met today
and adjourned without: any announce
ment being made regarding a new min
istry headed by Lloyd-George.
