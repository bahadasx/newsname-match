THE NEW PREMIER

CHURCHILL TO COME BACK
'
\nd Sir Edward Carson is
Expected to be in New
I Government.
LONDON. Dec 7.?It having been
decided definitely that David-Lloyd
I Oeorgc will undertake the formation
Iof a ministry political circles today
were interested chiefly In the personnel
of tho new cabinet and the prospect
of the new premier for getting
together a combination that will have
the support of a majority in the House
of Commons.
Few if any of the Liberal members
of Mr. Asquith's cabinet arc likely to
accept office under l.loyd-George and
some of the Cnionist members like J
Austin Chamberlain and Lord Robert
Cecil are likely to stand aside. How.
ever it is assumed tliat at a conference
rit Jiucklngham palace they asMired
the new premier of their benevolent
neutrality thus making bis task
much simpler.
Am fur as the cabinet is concerned
L ilie new nremier has a nucleus in A.
I Donar Law, Lord Durby, Lord Curzon,
Sir Frederick I- Smith and Sir Edward
Carson, while Ciscount Reading,
the Lord Chief Justice, is likely to
join the ministry. Ollu r Liberal members
may be drawn from men sin,., as
Sir Frederick Cawley, member of the
House of Commons from the Perst\
wlch division of Lancashire and Sir
George Pollard, member from the Ecclos
division of Lancashire, who al
though the public have heard little 01
them have done efficient work in committees.
Dr. Cristopher Addison, parliamen!
tary under secretary for munitions, is
Vialmost certain to have a place in the
cabinet and Col. Winston Spenser
Churchill, former First Lord of the
Admiralty, is slated for high office.
Under the circumstances It is believed
the construction of a cabinet
will be put a matter of a day or so and
that bv Monday the new government
will meet.
The new government will meet the
House of Commons to lcHrn what
manner of reception will be accorded
... A test of its strength can be mado
on vote of credit which must bo moved
immediately.
Today's session of the House of
Commons was expected to lie a formal
one. it being doubtful whether any of
the ministers would put in an appearRncp.
The House of Commons adjourned
till Tuesday. A meeting of the Liberal
party over which Mr. Asquith will
preside' will lie held Friday.
II According lo the Central News
I, fioclation the labor party has decided
Kto accept an invitation to l)e represented

|Fale of Visiting Armies is
Not Learned From the
Dispatches.
i
Tlio brief dispatches in which the'
fall of Bucharest was announced left [
in doubt the fate of the armies which
were resisting the advance of the Teu- j
tonic invaders. It is assumed in most
entente quarters, however, that there j
i was no "last stand" by the Rumanians I
j before their capital ami such news as |
had trickled through from German
sources indicates that Hueliareat was!
virtually deserted when the Teutonic
forces entered. The city is said to have
been found uninjured.
Military commentators in the en-'
tente capitals point to the probabilityi
that the action just prior to the cap-'
j tare of Bucharest were fought merely!
I with a view to delaying the advance I
of held marshal Von Mackensens forc-l
es and aiding in the escape of the!
main body of the Rumanians. The j
capture of I'loeehti. the railway jtine-i
tion its miles north of Bucharest how-!
ever, may have blocked the retreat i
of a part of the Rumanian forces.
German opinion is expressed to the
effect that the Rumanians have decided
to abandon all of Wallaehia, the
main portion of Ire Rumanian kingdom
and retire to Moldavie their nortli
eastern province where their fronts
would he materially shortened
and where they would he in cfciso j
touch with the Russians.
Emperor William has sent following
telegrams to Field Marshal von Mackonsen
in command of Teutonic forces
on southern Rumanian front: "It Is

OIL FIELDS TOO GO
WITH BUCHAREST
Paris Newspapers Refer in
Gloomy Terms to Rumanian
Reverse.
(By Associated Press!
PARIS. Dec. 7?News of the fall of
Bucharest was received here with sorrow
and mortification although it had
been regarded as Inevitable since the j
battle of the Argechu was lost.
"We understand perfectly" stays thci
Petit Journal "what the Rumanians1
are suffering, for we too have suffer-,
ed the sorrows of invasion. We associate
ourselves sll Hie more with
their grief since we realize with bitterness
of spirit that we are partly responsible
for lite ratastroplie which
was not tine entirely to the military
ability of the enemy's lenders."
All newspapers say that events must j
ho a lesson to I he allies which ought
to spur them on to more rapid and energetic
action and nhovo all to the organized
and effective use of their common
resources.
The commentators while generally
gloomy make the point that the Rumanians
having abandoned Bucharest
have now a much shorter linp from
which their armies having emerged Intact
from the claws of Germans enveloping
movement have a good
rhance of holding until allies como to
relief. But It is agreed that with the
fall of Plooehti there appears no probability
of saving the oil fields which
is considered the worst feature of the
situation.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. ? Former
Senator Root in a paper reail here to-!
! day at the opening session of the Anti-,
Suffrage convention outlined his rea- j
son for opposition to the proposed con-1
stitutional amendment to enfranchise j
women.
"I atn against having the Constltu j
tion of the United States ameuded so !
! as to impose woman's suffrage on the
states which do not wish for it, not
(merely, hut chiefly because my judgment
does not approve of* woman's
suffrage but for a much more vital reason."
said Mr. Root's paper. "It is a j
destruction of the right of self govern- j
ment anil a subjection of the people ;
of New York to the government of others.
"Having failed to secure the assent i
to woman's suffrage of such states as
South Dakota and West Virginia aud
New York and Pennsylvania and Ohio,
tlie advocates of woman's suffrage
now seek to compel such states to accept
it against their will and to compel
litem to carry on their local government
and select their representatives
in national government In conformity
to the opinion of the people of
other states who are in favor of woman's
suffrage. I think such an attetnpt
is contrary to the principles of 1
) liberty upon which the American titi!

it can not endure."

part ment today contends that (\? Brit-;

terranean on November f?. was in real ,
t ity a transport ship lor troops in the1
service of the British government,,
which is to be considered as an auxiliary
war ship according to international
law and can therefore be treated
like a warship. The Herman government's
attitude, however, like that in
the .Marina case is expressed to lie one
of readiness to make amends if it he
shown that the submarine commander
violated Germany's pledges to the
1'nited States.
What action the State department
will take is problematical. Should it
I l?e shown that the Arabia was. us Germany
contends, a transport, this gov
I ernment probably would admit the
sinking was justified. If. however, it. is
shown that the submarine commander i
was mistaken in holding her to be a!

confront the State department.. At !
the time the Sussex was sunk Ger- J
many was told that this government
