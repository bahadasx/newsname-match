CHICAGO, Dec. 7.-—Death was
more enticing than trying to rear a
family on twelve dollars a week, with
prices at the present level and Mrs.
Anna Oram turned on the gas and
lay down to die. Neighbors, how
ever, discovered her and today she
is recovering.
Before fier attempt at suicide, Mrs.
Oram prepared a 'budget showing
how she tried to stretch her hus
band's small wage over the expenses
of the household.
"This is what it .takes a week—
$4 rent, $2 lunch and carfare. That
leaves $6 a week for light, fuel, food
and clothes, medicine and Incidentals
for husband, children and myself. I
owe about $180 on a number of bills.
I can only spare 1 a week towards
effacing this indebtedness. God help

State Wide Probe.
D[BJNVER, Colo., Dec. 7.—Plans are
under way here today to institute a
state wide legislative probe into the
prices of food stuffs and market facili
ties, when the Colorado legislature
convenes early in January.
To place the burden of the high cost
of living, is the primary object of the
probe which is to extend to every
class of food-stuffs. The activities of
the farmer, the middle man, the
wholesaler and retailer will ibe investi
gated thoroughly.
Congress is to be urged to place an
embargo upon the exportation of liv
ing commodities and a state trade
commission, on the lines of federal
trade commission is to be created per
manently to investigate any similar
conditions if present plans of legisla
tors are carried out.
A memorial to congress urging reg

stuffs will be offered as a joint resolu

Problem.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Classing
some railroads of the past with "high
way robbers," former Secretary of
State Bryan today declared. feHeral
control of railroads will bring Into na
tional politics "a corruptive force
greater than we have ever known."
Bryan "was testifying at his own re
quest before the NewUujds Joint con
gressional coohmittee investigating
public utilities.
"The fact that the railways ask for
it is conclusive proof that federal con
trol is not intended for greater regu
lation," Bryan declared, "and every
congressman would be subject to
it. The means to secure nominations
and elections would be given to him."
Bryan said federal control would
tempt congressmen, would make every
election a light (between the railways
and the people and would break down
state lines.
Bryan came out flatly for govern
ment regulation of railroad capitaliza
tion—including bond issue—but op
posed government ownership.
"I, personally, can't say I desire gov
ernment ownership," he said. "I lean
to the individual idea rather than the
collective. I believe in individual
ownership except where competition
is impossible."
Questioned by Senator Newlands,
Bryan said: "Some of the railroads
have been guilty of things that would
bring discredit on an ordinary high
way robber."
A railroad, said Bryan, should be
permitted just enough revenue to keep
its stock at par, "as stabl© as govern
ment bond." If its dividend raised
the value of the stock by ten per cent,
he said the revenues ought to be de
creased.
"Don't you think, Mr. Bryan, that
the people love and admire the rail
ways?" asked Representative Adam
son.
"You put it a little stronger than I
would," Bryan replied. "I think they
separate some offices from the rail
roads they love."
Control of Freight Cars.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.—With the
country suffering from shortage of
freight cars, the interstate commerce
commission, reporting to congress to
day, recommended federal control of
the problem

arrived," he continued. "The grain
was also removed.
"The Rumanians were short oil

with light artillery and depetuieit

Covered Left Flank.
PETROGRAD, Dec. 7.—Russian
troops covered the left flank of the
Rumanians in their retreat from
Bucharest.
The war office statement today an
nounced the evacuation of the Ru

at mid-day yesterday.
"Our troops covering the left fl.ink
of the Rumanian southwards, retired
also," the statement said.
In the Trotush fighting in Walla
chia, the Rumanians retired eastward,
the report said, under enemy pres
sure, their rear guard holding the
Teutons.
In the Transylvanian fighting,
around Shelvov, the enemy captured
a small portion of the Russian posi

forced part of some demolished
trenches. The Gunalovtze position
was later restored to Russian hands.

EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 7.—After
re^quipping his army with supplies
tak^n from Chihuahua City, Villa is
moving again, according, to rerorta
made to the United States authori
ties here today. In official circles
here it is believed the bandit chief
is making his own headqua-ters at
San Andres, from which point he is
scattering his forces In small bands
and directing their operations.
In the past three days a rear guard
action between Vlllistas and govern
ment troops took place south of
Arento, eight miles southwest of
Chihuahua City. The movements of
the government troops are hampered
by lack* of railway equipment, as
Villa took with him practically every
available piece of rolling stock. He
drove many automobiles away for the
use of his officers.
Unofficial ft ports ooming to mining
companies here state that the city of
Durango was evacuated December 2
by General Gayira before an attack
by bandits and discontented mem
bers of the Carranza garrison. A
confirmation of these reports cannot
be obtained through official channels.
A Mexican Central freight train was
held up and looted yesterday by ban
dits, presumably under Quevedo at
Gallgo, midway between the bortlor
and Chihuahua City. Three carloads
of food stuffs were captured by the
bandits.

Gray, an American, employe of the
Alvarado Mining company, was tor
tured and hanged until he was dead
by Vlllistas, when the bandits entered
Parral a month ago, according to word
brought here today by two mining
men.
While the two mining men were
telling their story of the dftath of
Gray in the offices of the Alvarado
company here, a telegram from the na
tive foreman of the company's mines at
Parral reached the office. The mes
sage read:
"Everything, safe except Gray. He
is dead."
Mihing company officials accepted it
as authentic and as corroborating the
refugees' story.
Gray was acting foreman of the

caped before the attack upon Parral
and escaped across the Sierras. Gray
