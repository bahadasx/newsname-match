DEAL IS DEING INVES
TIGATED BY OFFICIALS
While the Spanish Land Grant re
cently filed in Quay county is causing
much speculation among property own
ers the loan companies are paying lit
tle attention to it. It seems to be such
a farce that nothing detrimental will
come from it. but the l.l.ng was made
perhaps to keep some easier shark
from landing behind the bars for car-
lyii.K till i. KiKimi. nwmuiu. .v mm.-
her of smiall rales hnve been made in
audition to i..e large ucais consum-
mated recently ami sf.ll no record was
lo be found in i Quay county where the
land is located. However, if the grant
proves a farce as it now seems some
one should be made to pay for the
trouble it will cause in after ycais to
the property owners when they must
hnve the account of the tiling inserted
in their abstracts. Uncle Sam's au
thorities are now working on the jnal
ter and it is hoped they will bo able
to dispose of it without nny difficulty.
The following letter from S. Burk
imrl, U. S. Attorney for New Mexico,
is self-explanatory and throws some
new light on the recent Spanish grant
tiled in Quay county:

groin, having for its aim and object
thc giving rather than the receiving
"I Chnctma. presents. It lias long
iieen a custom of eliurches and Sun-
day schools to give presents to the

i rule in the past, the churches have
individually rendered Christmas pro-
'.'innis including Christmas tree--.
Santa Clans, Etc. After the confer
ence Tuesday niuht the joint commit-
ee, it was decided that this year, the
I'luirches would dispense with the gi-
ing of gifts to their children and would
ill join in staging a big Chriitmiis on-
''lUinment what is termed "Conimu-
oily Christmas" at the Opera House
ihe evening of Friday, December lii.'.
ecnrdingly a committee, composed
of the following named parties wai
appointed as a program committer,
nnd they have already announced n
Pantominc and a Cantata as a part of
the program.
Rev. Hoeriug, Mrs. Snvnge, Mrs.
Kerlin, Mrs. K. E. Clark, and Mrs. Roy

sical director, which will insure a most
splendid musical program. C. A. Pow

House, has very kindly donated the
use of the Opera House for the oc-1
ension.
Admission to this program will he
