Dr. Edwards Now
Recommends It
Prominent Georgia Physician
Now Gives Master Medicine
His Unqualified Endorsement
Dr. J.'T. Edwards, of Fayett
ville, Ga., one of the best-known
members of the medical profes-
: . . . .. . . i
sion in the state oi ueorgia,
makes a statement that will un
doubtedly produce a profound
impression throughout the South.
"In my thirty years of "active
practice as a licensed physician
in the state of Georgia," says
Dr Edwards, "I have never seen
anything to equal Tanlac as a
medicine to produce results." I
hear people on all sides telling
of the benefits they have derived
from its use.
"Tanlac is simply the talk of
my town. I have no hesitancy
in recommending the medicine;
and as a matter of fact, I am
prescribing it for my patients
almost every day.
"Only a few days ago a well
known woman of Fayettville
came to me and told me about
the remarkable relief her'daugh-
ter had earned from the use of
th.i Tnerlirme. She said her
daughter had . been confined to
her hed for three years with

what had been pronounced pelle
gra,j and that after using Tanlac
for a short time she was able to
be about,' and was qn the road to
recovery. .
But this is only one instance.
People in all walks of life in and
around our little city are givjng
similar indorsements to the med
icine. Seldom a day passes that
someone does not come to me
and say ' something about the
good results they are" getting
from the use of Tanlac.
Several unusual gams in
weight have . been reported by
some of our most prominent peo
ple, and I have treated some
stubborn cases of indigestion,
catarrhal conditions, and organic
disorders and secured splendid
results with Tan)?."
Commenting upon this state
ment, Mr. G. F. Willis, southern
distributor of Tanlac, said: (
'Coming from the high source
it does,' and especially from a
member t)f the medical profes
sion, this straightforward utter
ance of Dr. Edwards is more
than a recommendation. It is a
triumph! Tanlac, Nature's great
vegetable tonic, ' corrective and
system-builder, is truly one of
the greatest discoveries of the
decade, and the best evidence of
this is the confidence and high
esteem in which it is held, not
