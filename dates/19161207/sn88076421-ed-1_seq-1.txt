HSMARCH TO HAVE
REAL GRAND OHM
Three Productions by the Famous San
Carlos Grand Opera Co., With
100 Members and 20 Stars.
What will' undoubtedly prove the
most interesting and important mus
ical-theatrical event of the season at
Bismarck is the coming of the San
Carlo Grand Opera company, that
noted organization of songbirds made
famous a few years back by such
singers as Nordica, Constantino, Niel
•on and others. This aggregation has
been secured for three productions at
the Bismarck Auditorium on Friday
and Saturday evenings and Saturday
matinee, Dec. 15 and 16. The event is
under the local management of Mrs.
W. F. Cushing, who has been respon­
sible for the appearance at Bismarck
of so many superb musical affairs.
The entire San Carlo forces of one
hundred members are coming, with a
brilliant singing chorus of forty, a
complete grand opera orchestra and
the twenty leading artists. There are
four world-famous sopranos, an equal
number of eminent mezzo sopranos,
four distinguished tenors, including
Salazar, the famous Spanish artist
four celebrated baritones, including
Battistini, from Italy, and two of the
finest bassos now singing in opera.
The productions to be staged, with
dates for each, are as follows:
Friday evening, Dec. 15, Donizetti's
great 3-act opera, "Lucia Di Lammer
moor Saturday matinee, the ever
welcome double bill, "Cavalleria Rus
ticana" and "Pagliacci Saturday ev­
ening, Verdi's massive and spectacu­
lar opera, "Aida." Each opera will
be sung by a difleflrent cast of prin­
cipals, and staged upon the same high
plane of artistry and traditional beau
tar as when the company appears at
Boston, Montreal, St. Louis, Omaha,
Minneapolis and St. Paul. The operas
will be directed by the noted Italian
maestro, Signor Carlo Peroni.
The opera event will no doubt prove
interesting to local music-lovers,
whose opportunity to enjoy an affair
of this magnitude and importance does
not occur any too frequently. The
prices are to be of the popular char­
acter, the tickets ranging in price
from $1, $1.50 and $2. Mrs. Cushing
wishes to announce through these col­
umns that she will receive and care­
fully fill mail orders from this town,
it being her desire to make the opera
event fully as attractive to people in
outlying towns as to those in Bis­
marck. The regular sale of seats,
however, will open on Tuesday, Dec.
12, at Finney's drug store, Bismarck.
The San Carlo company maikes the
Bismarck visit enroute to Winnipeg,
where an extended engagement of two
weeks has been arranged for.
OLD SETTLERS WILL
MEET NEXT WEEK
Olaf A. Olson Will be Host to Mem­
bers of the Ward County Old Set­
tlers Association.
The Ward County Old Settlers As­
sociation will hold their semi-annual
midwinter meeting in this city dur­
ing the week beginning Monday, Dec.
13. The meetings and social sessions
will be held in the basement of the
Lexington hotel. The proprietor, Olaf
A. Olson, who is a member of the as­
sociation, will decorate the place in an
appropriate manner without a cent's
expense to the association, which will
be fully appreciated. The midwinter
meetings are always enjoyable social
functions, some red hot games of Nor­
wegian whist being played and enjoy­
able refreshments being served each
day. Ed Kelley has premised to make
one of his famous Mulligan stews. A
grapevine telegram from Donnybrook
says that Frank Kirkelie will be on
hand with a brand new deck of marked
cards.
CORRECTED PRAYER.
The 'Lexington Herald retells the
story first recounted by Bishop Dud­
ley, of sainted memory, of the prayer
of the river captain for a family
which had lost its all during one of
the floods of the Mississippi river. As
Bishop Dudley recounted the incident,
a meeting was held to take up a col­
lection for the destitute family. An
old-time captain of a Mississippi
steamer was called upon to pray. He
prayed:
"O, Lord, we beg you to care for
this destitute family. Lord, send
them clothes tcf cover them and pro­
visions to feed them send to them a
barrel of flour, and a barrel of meal,
and a barrel of potatoes, and a barrel
of onions, and a barrel of salt, and a
barrel of pepper. O, hell, Lord, that's
too much pepper."
STATE ASSETS HIGH.
As a growing business the state of
North Dakota ranks high. A state­
ment prepared by the tax commission
of the state shows that the common­
wealth of the state is worth $61,219,
698 over and above all liabilities.
Reports come from the western part
of the state that Tabbits have been
doing some damage to crops and trees
in that section.
If young trees are not protected
from the animals during the winter
they are likely to come out in the
spring minus a part of the bark. Any
covering that extends from the ground
up to tne first branches will serve as
a protection. Such material as corn
tmmwrw^
1
eW-r'
uJ'w
stalks, paper, rags, wire screen or
some manufactured covering may be
used. If a close-fitting material like
paper or wood-veneer is used, it is
best to remove it in the spring to pre­
vent insects and mice from collecting
about the trunk of the tree. Seeds
and grass should never be piled
around the tree.
Probably the best way to save grain
from injury is to kill the rabbits. A
great deal of good is done by "rab­
bit hunts," which are often held in the
form of contests, so that a great deal
of sport is connected with the killing.
In this particular part of the state
the number of rabbits will be greatly
lessened next year, as probably half
of the animals killed were females.
Manson Bros. Ready for Xmas.
Manson Brothers, who are among
the most prominent of Minot's busi­
ness concerns, are better prepared for
the holiday trade than ever before.
They own and operate their own can­
dy factory and here will be found a
large force of experts at work making
the most delicious of pure candies.
These will not only be sol^ in their
own l&finot stores, but the trade of
the northwest will be supplied as well.
A visit to the Manson stores at this
time of the year is a treat for old and
young.
Hunters Kill 1418 Rabbits in 24 Hours
A wonderful rabbit hunt was held
recently in the vicinity of New Eng­
land, in Hettinger county. Sides were
chosen and 122 hunters turned out. In
just 24 hours they had bagged 1,418
rabbits, the total weight being 11,000
pounds. One side turned in 735 rab­
bits and the other 683. All of the
rabbits were from the "John Rabbit"
family. This is thought to have been
the greatest slaughter of rabbits ever
recorded in the United States. Many
of them were killed in the moonlight.
HARRY COOPER WAS
SEVERELY SCALDED
G. N. Engineer Suffered Burns About
the Eyes When Steam Hose
Struck Him.
Harry Cooper, a well known Great
Northern engineer, was severely
scalded about the eyes Monday even­
ing at Aylmer, N. D. Mr. Cooper
runs between Minot and New Rock
ford and was on his way east when
the accident occurred. The injector
of the engine was not working prop­
erly and the steam hose flew up,
striking him across the face. His
eyes were horribly scalded but doc­
tors believe that the sight will not be
impaired. He was given attention im­
mediately and Tuesday afternoon was
brot home, where he is resting as com­
fortably as could be expected.

Atty. Francis J. Murphy to Re-open
Offices.
Atty. Francis J. Murphy and family
have returned from Bismarck and are
again occupying their home on the
south hill. Mr. Murphy, who has held
the position of assistant Attorney
General of North Dakota for the past
two years, will re-open law offices in
Minot after January 1, occupying the
offices now held by Grant S. Youmans.
Mr. Murphy is considered one of Mi­
not's ablest attorneys and many old
friends are glad that he and his esti­
mable family have returned.
HE GUESSED WRONG.
A small boy carrying a basket got
on the train the other morning bound
for Mapleton. He found the car full
and stood in the aisle as if uncertain
what to do. A gentleman who was
occupying a seat with his grip beside
him, put the grip on the floor and the
boy's basket on the rack above his
head and offered the lad part of his
seat. Presently the gentleman felt
something trickling down on his head
from the basket above.
"My boy," said he, "your pickles are
leaking."
"Them ain't pickles," replied the
boy. "Them's puppies."—Ida Grove

BOUGHT WHEAT FROM
SAME FARMER 26 YEARS
AGO FOR FORTY CENTS
P. L. Hodge, one of Minot's old
time residents, was back from
Bordulac, N. D., last week visit­
ing old friends. He is now in
charge of the Bordulac Farmers'
Elevator. Mr. Hodge Informs us
that he was engaged in buying
grain at Bordulac twenty-six
years ago and at that time he
bought No. 1 hard wheat from a
farmer living near there, G. T.
Lund, paying him 40 cents a
bushel. He bought No. 1 Nor­
thern wheat from this same
farmer this year, paying him
$1.90 per bushel. This is a rec­
ord which we doubt can be equal­
led in the United States.
N. D. FARMERS MADE
HI WISCfWSD
647 Farmers Visit University at Mad­
ison and Praise Wisconsin's Edu­
cational System.
The Madison, Wisconsin, State Jour­
nal of Wednesday, has the following
to say regarding the North Dakota
farmers' special:
NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS
HERE TO TAKE LESSONS
"Wisconsin's system of education is
as perfect as can be obtained under
an elective system and we wish to
copy its best features."—N. C. Mac
donald, supferintendent-elect of public
instruction.
"North Dakota is on the eve of
great development and will move
faster in the next five years than any
other state in twenty-five years."—
Lynn J. Frazier, governor-elect.
"North Dakota has wonderful possi­
bilities. but will show the nation that
it is able to do just as wonderful
things in the field of diversified farm­
ing as it has already done in wheat."
—Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the
North Dakota Agricultural college.
"These farmers have made them­
selves wealthy by their own efforts,
and have an average property holding
of $187,000."—John N. Hagan, com­
missioner-elect of agriculture.
"The woman can be as good or &
better farmer than her brother, hus­
band, or any other human man."—
Mrs. C. W. Kelly, America's greatest
woman farmer.
A rich group of farmers, 647 strong,
hailing from the fertile bottom lands
of North Dakota, arrived in Madison
this morning to study the most mod­
ern forms of diversified farming, as
exemplified by the university of Wis­
consin college of agriculture.
The-western farmers came to Mad­
ison as a part of a week's tour thru
their- own state, Minnesota and Wis­
consin, to culminate in three days
visit to the Chicago live stock show.
The entire day was spent at the col­
lege of agriculture hearing lectures
on modern handling of the farm prob­
lem.
That it is the greatest educational
tour ever made is shown by a few sta­
tistics given by Governor-elect Lynn
J. Frazier of North Dakota, in discus­
sing the future of his state.
All but Five Farmers.
The 647 men on the trip are, with
only five exceptions, farmers. These
five men are in charge of the trains
for the three railroads which are han­
dling the tour. Five others are bank­
ers, but they are also farm owners.
In the list of 647 persons are twen­
ty-seven women, wives and daughters
of the farmers, and one of these, Mrs.
C. W. Kelly, is said to be the greatest
woman farmer in the world. She has
national fame as an expert on seed
corn, and a corn grower. Her hus­
band is a farmer wh« specializes on
wheat, while a dairyman and stock
raiser also.
The total wealth represented by the
men in the party, and controlled by
them, is $120,900,000. Possibly a few
extra paltry dollars, but in round
numbers the average wealth of the
entire party is $187,000.
Additional Critic Teacher for Model
School.
Congestion in the model school of
the Minot normal is noticeably reliev­
ed this week thru an additional teach­
er, who began work on Monday. Miss
Johanna Soland comes splendidly
equipped to take charge of the work
of critic in the sixth and seventh
grades. Her educational qualifica­
tions include normal school and col­
lege courses, being a graduate of the
Oshkosh, Wis., normal school, and of
the University of Wisconsin, with the
degrees of B. A. and M. A. She has
also done post graduate work in the
University of Chicago. Her exper­
ience in teaching was most recently
that of supervisor of English in the
schools of Kalispell, Montana
The Christian Associations of the
normal school will arrange for the an­
nual pre-holiday party to be held Fri­
day night of this week. It is to be
strictly juvenile in garb and manner,
yet none too old to attend. Faculty
members and the entire student body
are urged to be present.
Mother of Mrs. T. Hegle Died in Min­
nesota.
The mother of Mrs. Thos. E. Hegle
passed away Saturday at her home,
Detroit, Minn., at the ripe old age of
85 years. She leaves an aged husband
and one daughter, Mrs. Hegle. The
daughter came into this city from her
farm home south of the city Tuesday,
intending to go to Detroit to attend
the funeral, but learned that she
could not reach the old home in time.
Mrs. Hegle has the sincere sympathy
of her many friends over her bereave­
ment.
BANK RESOURCES GAIN 42
PER CENT IN 3 MONTHS
According to reports coming from
Washington, North Dakota's banking
business has increased $47,000,000, 42
per cent in the three months ending
with October. Growth in the coun­
try's banking resources in the same
time is put at six and one-half million
dollars. The record is declared to be
without a parallel in the history of
this or any other country.
Great gains have been made in most
all states but the middle went shows
the best gain in the past three years

ORGANIZING FARMERS'
CO-OPERATIVE MARKET
Selling Stock in $30,000 Concern
Propose to Erect Building in
the Spring.
The Farmers' Co-operative Market
has been organized in this city with a
capitalization of $30,000, with the fol­
lowing officers:
N. J. Coddington, president.
Evald Kvam, secretary and treas­
urer.
A. C. Roan, manager of stock sales.
The first stock in the concern was
offered for sale Tuesday. The plans
for a building which it is proposed to
erect in the spring, calls for enclosed
stalls where farmers may drive with
their loads of produce, backing up to
a platform. On the opposite side,
booths will be provided where produce
will be offered for sale. The plan is to
rent the stall and booths at a reas­
onable figure and make this a central
place where the seller and the buyer
can get together to their mutual ad­
vantage. The building is to be heated
so that the place may be operated
thruout the year.
Markets such as this one have been
operated very successfully in many of
the cities of the east and in Canada.
The par value of each share of stock is
$25.00.
Plans have been prepared for a
building 50x100 feet, to be used for
the business of the market. These
plans provide for a full basement and
one story structure of cement block,

caring for all sorts of produce and
commodities. The basement will con­
tain a number of bins for the storage
of commodities of farmers who desire
to take advantage of carlot ship­
ments of produce of which one indi­
vidual farmer may not have a suffic­
ient amount to make a carload, but
which combined with the amounts of
other farmers would make buch car
lots. These products could be stored
until there were enough to nrake the
carload, when they could be sold on
track, or shipped to the larger mar­
kets. Commission horses in the lar­
ger cities will have their buyers at the
market when such commodities as po­
tatoes or cabbage or other products
of the farm are offered in sufficient
quantities to provide car loads. The
same facilities will be such that the
cost of handling after the products are
stored will be reduced to the lowest
possible point.
A site along one of the railways is
to be secured.
The gentlemen who are pushing the
new enterprise are all well known cit­
izens of this part of the state. Mr.
Coddington has spent considerable
time investigating markets in a num­
ber of eastern and middle west cties
where this plan of selling farm pro­
duce is in vogue. He has worked out
the details of the plan and is familiar
with the success which has followed
the development of the market plan in
a number of places. Those associated
with him are experienced co-operative
men, who have given much time and
study to the new methods of bringing
producer and buyer together.

'TED'' WALSH'S BROTHER
KILLED IN CANADA
John Walsh, Former Minot G.
Fireman, Killed at Moosejaw
Monday Night.
N.
"Ted" Walsh, the well known barber
employed at the Leland barber shop,
received a telegram Monday night
stating that Itis brother,~John, had
been killed but he received no partic
lars as to how the accident happened.
Mr. Walsh left that night for Moose
jaw.
John Walsh formerly lived in Minot,
where he was employed as a Great
Northern fireman. He moved from
here about five years ago but was
back on a visit last summer.. He was
35 years of age and leaves a wife and
family. He leaves many old friends
in Minot who will be pained to learn
of his death.
YOUMANS DEFEATED.
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 2.—The su­
preme court this afternoon upheld the
district court of Ward county in deny­
ing Grant S. Youmans, of Minot, dam­
ages of $250,000 against Governor
Hanna and other former members of
the state banking board for the al­
leged wrecking of Youmans' bank in
1913.
Ward County Issued 2501 Hunting
Licenses.
Ward county will again lead the
state in the number of resident li­
censes sold. This year has seen a
steadily increasing number of licenses
sold. This may in part be due to the
increasing interest in the sport allur­
ing, or it may be to the extremely ac­
tive system of game wardens in the
field, under the leadership of Chief
Game Warden E. B. McCutcheon.
These men have been in every part of
the county and have kept an active
list of hunters who have purchased
licenses, and this year have referred
to these lists rather than bother the
hunter a great deal, which annoyance
sometimes bothers the hunters unnec­
essarily, just at the time when a nice
shot is presenting itself. While this
procedure has been highly gratifying
to the hunter, nevertheless, if he did
not see the game warden, he felt the
watchful eye was somewhere near,
this contributing largely to the in­
creased sale of licenses. Three years
ago Chief McCutcheon stated that he
would put Ward county in the front in
the matter of license sales, and both
last year and this, it has easily led the
state. County Auditor Thompson's
report shows the sale at his office of
2496 resident hunting licenses. 5 non­
resident licenses and 316 trapping li­
censes, while Chief McCutcheon has
sold 14 non-resident and 17 resident
licenses, so while all this money was
not paid by Ward county, the amount
raised in Ward county would be nearly
$3,000. This year has seen little if
any "sooner" shooting, which seems to
have been largely eliminated, much to
the delight of the hunter. In three
years and a half Ward county has
jumped from seventh to first place, re­
taining the latter place both last year
and this.
Shot Large Prairie Wolf.
Dan Blocher, who resides on the
Evans ranch southwest of Drady, shot
a large prairie wolf with his trusty
.30-.30 last Friday. Mr. Blocher spied
the wolf sneaking across the prairie
and gave him chase with an auto.
When 130 steps from the wolf, the an­
imal stopped and Mr. Blocher got a
good bead on him. The hide sold for
$6 and he received the usual bounty
besides.

MINOT AUTO SPECIAL
LEAVES SATURDAY
Magnificent Train Leaves Minot
Bound for Willys-Overland Fac­
tory at Toledo.
Everything is in readiness for the
special train which the Minot Auto
Co. will start from Minot Saturday
afternoon, Dec. 9, bound for the Wil­
lys-Overland factory at Toledo, O.
This is the greatest proposition ever
undertaken by any single automobile
concern in the United States and it is
going to give Minot a wonderful lot
of good advertising. The cars will
bear suitable banners and as the mag­
nificent train speeds away across the
country, the word Minot will be read
by thousands.
The train will leave Minot Satur­
day afternoon promptly at 4:20 o'­
clock and will carry 180 dealers, their
bankers and representatives of the
press from Malta, Mont., to Rugby on
the Great Northern and from Portal
to Martin on the Soo, taking in the
branch lines. The train will oe one of
the finest ever run out of Minot and
will consist of baggage car, two din­
ing cars, a buffet, seven sleepers and
an observation car. The train will go
over the Great Northern, Northwest­
ern and Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern, arriving in Toledo at 7 o'­
clock Monday morning. The cars will
be parked in the Overland yards.
At Toledo a banquet will be given
Monday night and a beefsteak sujiper
Tuesday night. The Willys-Overland
Co. will arrange numeroi's entertain­
ments for the party. They will be
shown thru the mammoth factory and
will learn how every part that goes to
make up the well known Overland car
is made. The factory covers so much
ground that autos are used in convey­
ing one around.
The train will leave Toledo Tuesday
night and will arrive in St. Paul
Wednesday evening at 7 o'clock, where
the party will be entertained for two
hours by the St. Paul commercial
club. The party will arrive in Minot
Thursday at noon.
A sixteen piece band, made up of
Overland dealers and employes, will
accompany the train and give con­
certs enroate."—The band will be in
charge of W. E. Slaybaugh, the well
known Overland salesman. Among
the members of the band are W. A.
Cormany, Mr. Hovland, of Coteau, R.
H. Grumdson of Carpio. Geo. Ver
milya of Towner, O. D. LaGrange of
Deering, Mr. Lunde of Sherwood, Mr.
Drovedahl of Arnegard, G. C. Hum­
phreys of Minot, Ralph Oard of Saw­
yer, H. L. Rounce, of Mondak, Mont.,
H. Packard of Minot and a saxaphone
artist from Plentywood, Mont. The
members of the band will gather in
Minot Friday for two rehearsals. They
are all well known musicians and will
show the people of the elite east that
westerners know how to do something
beside chase coyotes and "punch" cat­
tle.
The Willys-Overland Co. are featur­
ing these special trains from various
sections of the United States. The
business of this great concern has
grown to immense proportions, five
hundred million dollars being the ag­
gregate of the business done during
the past year. It is estimated that
the various automobile concerns and
the Willys-Overland Co. will spend
in the neighborhood of a million dol­
lars entertaining the dealers on the
various special trains during the next
few weeks.
Small Blaze at Foxholm.
Fire, probably due to live ashes, set
fire to a wood and coal shed in the
rear of A. Nelson's residence at Fox
holm Thursday morning and before
the bucket brigade could assemble,
completely destroyed the building. The
property is owned by George Rue of
Burlington.
Mrs. Morse's Son Died at Aurora.
Mrs. A. K. Morse, who resides with
her daughter, Mrs. Wm. Dewar, 615
3rd St. N. W., received word Wednes­
day that her son, J. B. Morse, had
passed away at his home in Aurora,
111. He was a conductor on the C. B.
& Q. railway for many years and had
been in ill health for some time. He
was an uncle of Mrs. Chas. Davy of
this city.
Scandinavian-American Makes Nice
Gain.
I Acording to the last statement of
the Scandinavian-American bank, the
resources total $512,721.77, while the
