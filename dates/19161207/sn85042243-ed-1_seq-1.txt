rected'an. order to district court mem­
bers of the provisional court assem­
bled for 2 o'clock this afternoon to
determine the present controversy
between justices-elect and retiring
justices, advising them that the sub­
scribers, as the supreme court of
North Dakota, denied the jurisdiction
./ and refused to recognize the existence
ofe the provisional court.
Judges Pollock, Crawford and Leigh
ton were served' at noon, while Judge
XuesBle and Judge Hanley, who com­
plete the provisional panel, wereserv
ed upon their arrival from the, east
and respectively.
The Court's Order.
The order follows:
"Whereas, At the last general elec­
tion J. E. Robinson, L. E. Birdzell and
R. H. Grace were each duly elected
to the office of judge of the supreme
court, to hold said office for six years
from the first Monday of December,
1916, pursuant to the constitution, and
they have duly qualified and organ­
ized and entered upon the discharge
of their duties as the supreme court
of the state
"And whereas, The former judges,
the Honorable Charles J. Fisk, E. T.
Burke and & B. Goss, wrongfully
claim the right to hold over after the
lation
termination of, their office on the first
-'Monday off December
"And vrttereas, You are ihvited to
appear and assume to act as a court
for the special purpose of determining
in a summary manner their claim or
4
"The said invitation is made under
Section 100 ot the constitution, pro­
viding that^fn case .a judge of the
supreme court 'shall be in ariy Way
interested 1W% causte brought before
said court, the remaining judges of
said court shall call one of the dis­
trict judges to alt with them on the
hearing of satdcause. It shows that
you are not-halted to sit with any of
the judges of the supreme court on
the hearing of any cause and that
there is no cause or action pending in
said court against the parties named
as respondents and that in the al­
leges cause all the judges holding
office are interested and that they
have no right in any way to constitute
a new supreme court.
"Therefore, By the supreme court
of North Dakota and by the under­
signed, duly elected and qualified and
acting judges, you are advised that
you have no right ,or jurisdiction to
appear as a court and to assume to
hear and adjudicate said matter, or
to appear as court to consider the
same.
"Dated at the capitol in'Bismarck,
North Dakota, this 6th day of Decem­
ber, 191«.
"By the Supreme Court of the State
of North Dakota.
"J. E. ROBINSON,
"L. EL BIRDZELL,
"R. H. GRACE,
"Judges of the Supreme Court."
Two Courts Too Many.
For the day North Dakota has three
supreme courts, each of which may
regard itself as the. one and properly
constituted tribunal.'
They are:
First Court—Chief Justice C. J.
Fisk and Associate Justices E. T.
Burke, E. B. Goss, A. A: Bruce and A.
Christianson.
Second Court—Chief Justice And­
rew A. Bruce, Associate Justices A.
Christianson, Luther E. Birdzell, J. E.
Robinson and R. H. Grace.
Third Court—Chief Justice Charles
A. Pollock, Associate Justices W. L.
Nuessle, J. M. Hariley, W. C. Crawford
and K. E. Leighton.
(For the immediate present, the
third named would seem to have
slightly the better of the argument.
It is recognized, for the once, by the
first court, and it has constitutional
authority for sitting today at the re­
quest of theN first court.
The second court, or the majority
of it, composed of the three justices
elect named at the recent general elec­
tion, claims its rights from the consti­
tutional clause which provides that
newly elected members of the su­
preme bench shall serve from the first
Monday in December. The trio's elec­
tion certificates, which will be issued
some time today, if the state canvas­
sing board completes its work in
time, will read "from the first Mon­
day in December," and whether the
court is seated now or put off until the
first of January, when other justices
elect have been seated, it will con­
tinue to regard itself as the one and
only legally constituted supreme court
for North Dakota during the month of
December, 1916.
Provisional Court Sits.
The provisional court consisting of
the five district juges called in by the
old supreme court' -convened at 2
o'clock this afternoon, for which hour
it had summoned Chief Justice Fisk
and Associate Justices, Burke and

Yesterday by Carl Kositzky, state aud
itor-elect. Mr. Kositzky stated, how­
ever, that he hope? to retain Mr. Ed­

least.
Dan McPhee will remain in the
state auditor's office arf chief clerk.
Miss Keiton of Mercer will become
Auditor Kositzky's personal stenogra­
pher. No changes in the office staif
other than those named are contem­
plated for the present.
Greenwood Keeps Job.
Among present appointive officials
who are billed to keep their johs un­
der the new administration, is E. A.
Greenwood, dairy commissioner. An­
other deputy who does not stand
much chance losing out is J. O. Lyng
stad, John Steen's right bower in the
state treasurer's office. Lyngstad has
serveds deputy for Steen from the
time the kugby man took office, and
he has made good.
The Governor's Secretary.
The governor's secretaryship ha}
jeen nicely lined up when a little fra­
cas in th6 ranks over tnfe proposed ap­
pointee kicked the beans into the fire.
Now the secretaryship is somewhat
up in the air.
The deputyship just vacated by
John Andrews in the secretary of
state's office is yet to be filled. Sec
retary of State Hall says he has two
good men in view and that he has not
quite made up his mind between them.
Austin Will Stick.
For the present, at least, W. D. Aus­
tin will retain his place as deputy in­
surance commisioner. Austin is gen­
erally regarded as a first-rate insur­
ance man* and S. A. Olsness, the in­
coming commisioner, being little vers­
ed in the technical features of the bus­
iness, will find the experience of his
deputy a valuable aid in readjusting
the office along lines proposed in the
Non-Partisan planks adopted by the
two principal parties!
MacDonald Keeps Quiet.
Neil MacDonald, the incoming sup­
erintendent of'public instruction, has
said nothing to date on the subject of

Lloyd George Encounters Bitter
Opposition of Political
Cliques
QUESTION IS WHETHER
HE CAN FORM CABINET
GreeK Muddle and Rumanian Dis­
aster Lead To Downfall of
Asquith lUnistry
London, Dec. 7.-r-The supreme ques­
tion of the hour is Whether David
Lloyd-George will succeed in forming
a new cabinet. He has been asked by
King George to form a new ministry,
following the retitefaent of the As
quith regime.
Against him Is bitterness of the po­
litical. factions and refusal of some
members of these cliques to serve in
the new ministry^ The crisis may
reach such a point that an election
will be necessary to decide the issues
at stake.
Lacked Firmness.
An editorial in one of the leading
newspapers of Rome says that the As
quith cabinet lacked firmness, deci­
sion and initiative and was indirectly
responsible for the Greek muddle and
the Rumanian disaster. This journal
expresses the hope that the new minis­
try will be politically stronger and in
military affairs more successful.
NorthclifTe's Statement.
Lord Northcliffe, England's fore­
most publisher) one of the strongest
figures in British public life today and
the man who through constant itera­
tion in his grea£ London newspapers
of demand fop greater unity, aggres­
siveness, efficiency "and force in Eng­
land's conduct of the war, really was
responsible for the shake up in the
British cabinet in a Written state­
ment for the United Press today, de­
tailed his,own personal Relief of what
that sliakeup.jpea.ns ta^fcglapd. Hip
statement follows:
"Lloyd George has given the knock
out to the gang of aged or inept medio
crties, who. have prevented the Brit­
ish empire from exerting its full force
in the war. Whatever happens these
malevolents cannot get together again.
Whatever government arises .cannot
but be an immense improvement on
that which has disappeared.
"Lloyd Gedrge is one of the few
British statesmen who' understand
the United States and I look for good
relations between Great Britain and
the republic as a result of his force­
ful action of yesterday.
Bonar Law is a safe man and if he
becomes prime minister, he will be
the first Canadian to achieve an honor
equal in dignity and importance to
your president."
Serious Obstacles.
Those familiar with Lloyd George's
determination, resourcefulness, per­
sonal magnetism and good luck are
entertaining serious doubts whether
he can surmount the obstacles before
him. It is thought that he will make
a vigorous appeal to all parties to
sink their political differences with
the single purpose of energetically
continuing the war. If successful, it
is believed that Lloyd-George will
carry to even greater extent than pro­
posed, the powers of a plenary war
council, probably limiting the actual
working cabinet to five or six mem­
bers in complete accord with each oth­
er.
The house of commons met and ad­
journed without announcement of the
new njinistry. After a two-minutfe ses­
sion it adjourned until next Tuesday.
The labor party has agreed to parti­
cipate in Lloyd George's new govern­
ment.

Oakland, Cal., Dec. 7.—How to win
a husband is told in Rev. John H.
Pierce's "ten commandments" for
girls seeking the royal road to matri­
mony today. Rev. Pierce has mar­
ried 4,000 couples in 30 years. Here
are his commandments:
First—Plan your campaign with the
wisdom of the serpent, conceal it with
the silence of the ciam, execute it
with the strategy af Machiavelli.
Second—Avoid all witticism about
marriage.
Third—'Veil with alluring helpless­
ness the iron of self-sufficiency.
Fourth—When a man declares "1
shall never marry!" mark him for
easy prey.
Fifth—Be inwardly bold as a lion,
outwardly timid as a fawn.
Sixth—The loudest flattery is the
silence of attention. When he speaks
listen. It is incense to his pride.
Shun Rouge.
Seventh—Shun the rouge pot and
the powder puff, for many, a maid has
lost out by sailing under false colors.
'Eighth—Pick out a chemical affin­
ity. Remember, oil won't mix with
water, but it will with myrrh.
Ninth—Copy the cat, for it is
squeezable, and the dove, for it cooes
caressingly, and the whippporwjll, for
it seems elusive.
Tenth—Remember that the su­
preme test of a man is a kiss. If he
will not yield under its pressure,
scorn him he is either brute or idiot.
TWO KILLED AUTOS
SKID WT BRIDGE
VICTIMS RECOVERING.
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 7.—.All four
injured victims of the George­
town accident, in which two per­
sons were killed last night, when
two autos skidded off a bridge
over the Buffalo river, are report­
ed this afternoon to be recover­
ing satisfactorily.
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 7.—C. J. Johnson,
60 years, and his daughter, 1)0 years,
name unknown, are dead: Ole Bol
stad, 40, and. Gilbert Estensen, 26.
both of Hendrum, are not expected to
live, and Ernest Estensen, 15, and Jo­
seph Stenne's, 22, also of Hendrum,
suffered severe injuries when two au­
to^: skidded on the sleet through a
bridge railing and crashed 20 feet to
the river below, one mile east of
Georgetown, Minn., last night.
The two accidents took place with­
in an hour's interval and were not
discovered until fully an hour after­
wards, owing to the lack of travel at
the point. As near as Clay county
officials could learn last night, the sec­
ond accident must have happened at
10:30 o'clock, one hour and a-half
later than the first.
Johnson was instantly killed by a
blow over the left eye as the machine
fell to the ice below. His daughter
is believed to have attempted safety
by jumping from the car. She was
thrown onto the ice, her body break­
ing through the thin frozen crust and
death resulting from drowning. The
young son of .Johnson was pinned un
derneath the machine, his leg dislo
cated and body painfully bruised.

Farmers Celebrate Dedication
of EieVator
St. Paul*, 'Minn., Dec. 7.—-Resolu­
tions opposing the proposed federal
embargo on grain and food were
drafted by the Equity Exchange con­
vention and forwarded today.
Quite a sensation was caused on
the floor of the convention today,
when th« farmers of three states
the TCquity operates on the largest
spale, cheered wildly the recommend­
ation of the resolutions committee. It
is this organization and its associa­
tions that recently swept North Dako­
ta in the last election.
The convention ended today with
the passage of resolutions against
price discriminations in purchasing
grain, and a law giving the shipper of
grain a lien on any membership in a
speculative grain organization.
E'. C. White, Buffalo, 'Mont. J. M.
Anderson, president of the Equity so­
ciety J. C. Crites, general manager of
the Equity exchange C. J. Brandt,
personal representative of Woodrow
Wilson, and A. C. Schmidt, managing
editor of "The Organized Farmer,"
were on the program for today's con­
vention.
Attacks Big Business.
In the dedicatory addresses Wed­
nesday, Robert Bridges, of Seattle,
urged public ownership of all public
utilities and fiercely attacked big bus*
ines. He declared they were trying to
keep the common people in ignorance
so they will not assert themselves and
urge government ownership.
He charged the newspapers with be­
ing subservient to the same class and
said that they refused to disseminate
information relative to public owner­
ship. In the evening the delegates
gave themselves over to red fire par­
ades and jollification. The farmers
were guests of the St. Paul outdoors
winter sports carnival committee
which is advertising, the January car­
nival.
How the great co-operative buying
and selling movement is gaining in
the United States was shown by
charts and exhibits opened this morn­
ing at the convention headquarters.
C. J. Brand, chief of the market divi­
sion of the federal department of ag­
riculture. was scheduled to address
the meeting this evening, but will ar­
rive too late. A. C. Schmidt, editor
of The Organized Fanner, asked all
business men present to hold up their
hands. Two hands went up. Then
Schmidt scored the audience. He said
the farmers are the biggest business
men in America, and that they should
consider themselves as such.

London, Dec. 7.—Bucharest and Plosti have beep evacuated by
the Allied forces in order to shorten the lines in W&ltachia, of.

Berlin, Doc. 7—The Rumanians evacuated Bucharest, in good
order, according t.o Paris dispatches, saving the army. This is the
first, admission on the part of the Allies that the Rumanian capital
had fallen.
At every hundred yards there is something dead or dying in
Rumania. The entire nation is a bloody, reeking shambles.
MAD WITH TERROR
flMic country is mad with terror. Anarchy and chaos reign.
Misery of the inhabitants is terrible. Most of this is due to the
Rumanian government itself which ordered all citizens to leava
their homes as the Germans advanced with almost increditable swift­
ness.
The Rumanian rear guard continued to fight strenuously t»
save the capital from disaster, but their efforts were in vain.

Four Capitals.
With the fall of Bucharest, the cen*
tral powers are in possession of four
capitals of entente allied states, the
other being Brussel, Belgrade and
Cettinje.
In the northwest, in the Carpathian
region, near the Bukowina frontier
and along the Moldavia front, the Riis*
sian offensive begun as a diversion
against the Teutonic advance into Ru*.

tie success.
To one who for the past ten days'
has followed the advancing German
troops by automobile over *,20(1. miles
through Craiova, Alexandria, patina
an* Pitscn Bireharest i& not the sole
object of the berman offensive. To
such an observer, Germany's' object
is the destruction of as much of the
Rumanian army as possible, preparar
tory to a march toward Russia, per*
haps with Odessa as the final gpa|.
The German operations are moving
forward here on a gigantic scale. For
miles over Rumania's roads, thous­
ands of columns pass in a ceaseless
moving picture. Besides these ad­
vancing columns are wagon trains ot
desperate-looking refugees and in the
villages, packed with troops are the
^Rumanian army prisoners. Despera*
tion of the Rumanian army staff in
its efforts to mobilize all possible
forces against the German advance
was evidenced today, when a force of
landsturm troops, clad in. civilan
clothes and armed with hunting rl*
ties, was captured.
Their ammunition was lead gullets
fitting the sporting rifles.
Proceed to Black 8«a.
Campiani and Sinaci have been oc­
cupied in addition to Bucharest. The
Germans are continuing their prog*
ress toward the Slack Sea.
Russian troops have covered the
left flank of the Rumanians retreat*
iiig from Bucharest. Official reports
state that Bucharest was evacuated
at noon yesterday.
City Deserted.
Bucharest was almost deserted by
civilians and soldiers when the Ger­
mans occupied it. The city was not
demolished.
Central Powers' detallments captur­
ed a garrison of 40 Russians at the
Russian outposts west of Lucken Le
gar river. Along the same front Teu­
tons maintained positions despite Ave
night attacks.
On the west front the Fifteenth regi*
ment of infantry succeeded in eqter*
ing the French trenches and capturing
Hill No. 304 on the west bank of the
Meuse. This position is located south­
west of Malancourt, where there were
