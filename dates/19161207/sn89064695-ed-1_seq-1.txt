PRESIDENT WILSON
PLEASED.
While at Washington recently
the publisher of THE TOMAHAWK
received from B. L. Fairbanks a
copy of the report of the returns
of the election of the precinct of
White Earth which, it was sug
gested should be filed with the
Secretary of the Interior, with a
letter, as an indication of the
Chippewa endorsement of the
present federal ^^ministration at
Washington. This was done, and
another letter, it was suggested,
should be written to President
Wilson along the same lines, so
that the following was written to
him and handed personally to Mr.
Tumu' y:
Washington, D. C.
November 17, 1916.
Hon. Wo-idrow Wilson,
President of the United States,
SIR:
The opportunity is now afforded
^me, as a msmbfr of *&o Chippewa
Tribe of Indians in the State of
Minnesota, to offer you a small
token of the appreciation and
gratitude that our people feel to
wards you for the interest that
you have shown in our tribal
affairs when appealed to for re
lief and I hereby respectfully sub
mit the report of my home pre
^cinct on the White Earth lieser
v.ttion showing that out of a total
of one hundred and forty-six votes
cast for Presidential candidate?,
one hundred and five were in your
favor.
1 am sure that the Minnesota
Chippewa?, who are Algonquin
Stock, would want me to add that
their gratification over your re
election is greatly enhaoc by the
^knowledge on their part that your
distinguished wife is a descendant
of one of the great Algonquin
Chiefs, a fact in which they take
the utmost pride.
Very respectfully,
Gus U. Beaulieu.
P. S.The 41 votes cast for Mr.
Hughes consisted mainly of those
cast by government employes and
foreigners residing on the reser
vation.
To the foregoing letter Presi
dent Wilson replied as follows:

My dear Mr. Beaulieu:

A BIG COUNCIL MEET-
ING.
A big council meeting took place
at the White Earth Hall last Fri
day to elect delegates to go to
Washington this month.
The delegates elected were John
W. Carl, B. L. Fairbanks, Frank
Smith, Geo. Campbell, Rev, C.
Beaulieu, Wm. Potter, Sha
gos-e kung, Jos. Bigbear, George
Bigbear and Aun-da-be tung.
Gus H. Beaulieu was also elected
as delegate at large.
The council was very largely at
teded by representatives from
Callaway, Mahnomen. Waubun,
Twin Lakes and Pine Point.
The resolutions that were offered
were adopted almost unanimously,
only six persons, namely Eugene
Warren. Frank Beaulieu, Antoine
Charretto, George Berry and
Frank Smth having voted against
them. Their only objection be
ing, as stated by Mr. Warren, was
the proposed employment of at
torneys which the resolution pro
vided for, and which is in opposi
tion to the employment of Attor
ney Furst whom he and Frank
Beaulieu had retained contrary to
ihe wishes of some of the oth'-r
tubers of the defunct Chippewa
CI lims Commission.
Tire discussion-took an acrimo
ni JUS turn on the part of Gene
Warren which was entirely un
necessary since the authorities at
Washington and Congress will un
doubtedly pay not much, if any,
attention to resolutions passed b.i
any council until practically united
action is taken by all the Chippe
was cf Minnesota toward the em
ployment of attorneys, and this
action mu^t be acceptable to a
great extent to the party in power
at Washington.
The resolution designated the
names of no attorneys to represent
the Chippewas of this reservation
before the Court of Claims but
left the selection of these attorneys
to the delegation which was elect
ed by the council to go to Wash
ington.
There was considerable discus
sion relative to the manner in
which the recent payment of tribal
funds was made and much criticism
thereof.
Also a statement was made rela
tive to a recent conversation which
took place at Washington between
Acting Commissioner of Indian
Affairs Merritt and Gus H. Beaul
ieu relative to the payment, and
the latter informed the council that
Mr. Merritt had expressed himself
as being favorable to the segrega
tion of Chippewa tribal funds.
He also stated that the same in
structions had been given Supfc.
Flinton about making the payment
liberally as had been given Supt.
Dickens at Red Lake whose man
ner of paying the Red Lake In
duns had not been criticised by
any one at R^d ike.
The council upon the whole was
very harmonious except for the
slight clash regarding the employ
ment of attorneys, but as this is a
best interests of the tribe in gen
eral, the delegation will no doubt

Before they had any very ex
tensive dealings with the United
States, or any other nation, the
American Indians had communal would be thus,
forms of government, and this
still existed among them as recent
ly as fifty years ago.
Each Indian village had its own
council, its own chief, its own vil
lage criers, and had ordinances two gentlemen somewhat

Death Of Frank Morrison.
Chas. Morrison, of Callaway,
received a telegram from Pine
Ridge Reservation, S. D., last Fri
day informing him of the death of
his brother, Frank Morrison.
Mr. Ifrank Morrison had been
in poor health for several months
and had been operated upon twice.
This wea-kened his constitution and
when he had another attack of his
old ailment he was unable to with
stand it, and John G. Morrison,
Jr., another brother who resides
at Red Lake, received a telegram
that Frank was seriously ill, and
be immediately left for South Da

Frank Morrison was the son of

LES ROYS.
(By Rev. C. H. Beau'ieu^
In the olden days of France the
title heading this article would
mean "The Kings."
The modern way of spelling
Les Rois."
I am not however writing
etymological ly at length nor writ
ing royal history.
I wish here only to introduce to
the readers of THE TOMAHAWK
couspic
Min
uou in Chippewa history in
on the ordinances of even some of nesota and Wisconsin, Mr. Pierre
the cities of the present 'day, at Roy and his brother Francois, in
least they were more thoroughly cidentally I will mention Vincent
enforced.
Each day the village council met
and designated the persons who
should go out hunting and fishing
for food for the village, and these
hunters and fishermen when they
returned from their day's hunt and
fishing did not take the game they
had secured to their lespective
homes but to the village quarter
master who divided it according
to the number in each family' As
long as there was an abundance of
wild game this system of common
ov/nership was very successful,
but as the country became settled
by the whites and game had com
menced to disappear the Indians
gradually abandoned the system,
and with the advice and assistance
of the Indian traders and the gov
ernment they began to adopt the
system of individual ownership.
Probably this is one of the princi
ple reason* why they have not
learned to accumulate property
and are in fact generally spend
thrifts.
Everything that is taking place
throughout the country indicates
that the whites are diifting to
wards the common ownership cus
tom, and this has become more ap
parent on account of the high cost
o( living of the present time.
Many of the municipal govern
ments throughout the country
have commenced to establish
markets which will be subject to
their control, and thus give to the
consumers the benefit which would
otherwise go to the middle men or
retailers and even to some of the
wholesalers.
If the common or even govern
mental ownership custom is adopt
ed by the world progress will cease
to exist unless some means are
taken by nations to encourage
progress and the inventions which
are the parents of progress.
11, a man not connected with Min
nesota's history.
The father of these gentlemen
was Vincent 1, who was in his day
connected with the American Fur
Co. as a post trader.
As a child I can remember the
gentleman as of mixed French and
Chippewa blood, and already (Agency as interpreter and assist
somewhat advanced in years.
He was a man of rather distin
guished appearance physically and
must have been somewhat oted
mentally, even though unable to
read or write. His instincts in
trade brought him above the level
of the illiterate voyageurs and
couriers des bois for ho became
boss of an island trading post.
This position made him a dweller
for the greater pirt in time of
regions now within Minnesota but
at the time of his activities, within
the boundaries of the Territory of
W jsconsm.
This Mr Roy in due time passed
away from this world in Wiscon-
White Earth,
^.v- ^^^s^|^^|if #ig^
sin. His son Vincent 11, never
removed to Minnesota as did his
brothers Pierre and Francois. He
remained at La Pointe, Wis but
subsequently moved to Superior,
Wis., where he died not long
since, and is remembered there as
an old citizen and highly respect
ed.
This brings me to a consider
a* ion of the two gentlemen of the
Roy family of whom I started out
to be briefly their biographer.
Pierre, or Peter as I shall here
after call him since he is better
known by the English form, must
have betrayed while young some
yearning and aptitude for learning,
for he was the only one of the
family to my knowledge who ac
quired '"book larnin."
How, and where, I do not know,
but always within my ken he was
a reader and a "Titer. And with
in this ken is the fsct that while
yet at La Pointe he had become
associated with the United States
ant otherwise
This was due to his knowledge
of the English language and his
ability to rfcad and write. Prob
ably his brother incent in later
years from propinquity in Super
ior may have learned to speak
English well, but of this I know
nothing.
Peter however spoke it well and
fluently, in fact it became to him
aside from the Chippewa the read
ier language, for though he spoke
French it was with less fluency
than the English.
I have said that he became better
known as Peter, but this state
ment needs qualifications. In the

The B. L. Fairbanks
Company,
Indian country he was known both
as Piernsh and Pienioh. accord
ing as the tongue speaking the
name had the French or the Chip
pewa twis*.
The Chippewa tongue has no
capacity to sound the letter, R, in
words containing this sound the
irasal tone comes into play, hence
Pienish.
It will be observed here that the
Chippewa tried to follow the
French and that Pierish is only an
effort at Pienish.
To get back to Peter he came to
Minnesota about 1850, perhaps
earlier. When Chippewa annuity
payments began to be made in
Minnesota (and this was before the
treaty of 1854) Peter became a
local fixture at the Agency on the
Crow Wing river at a point west
of where Braincrd now stands.
He belonged to the agency staff
and with him were associated Tru
man Warren and later on Paul II.
Beaulieu as government farmer.
When the agency was establish
ed, of course a blacksmith was
necessary and Agent Watrous
brought with him from La Pointe
a Mr. Chonnaid who had been
government blacksmith there.
Mr. Chonnard was possessed of
an interesting family, there weie
several stalwart sons and two
charming daughters.
Peter looked upon the charms
of one and lost his heart to her
but gained hers, and in a short
time Peter Roy and Philomene
Chonnard agreed to summons the
priest and then ihey set up house-
keeping.^,^
