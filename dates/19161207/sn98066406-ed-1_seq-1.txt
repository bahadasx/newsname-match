In the passing away of llev. Lester
Clark, this community loses one of its
oldest citizens,, a pioneer come from
good old Vermont stock, a man who,
settling in the wilds of Utrlin township
iu 1850, had known and met, fought
and conquered all the, hardships inci
dent to early pioneer life.
These 6ame hardships tended towards
the making of a character of sterling
worth, a man full of strength and ac
tivity, ambition and earnest effort and
withal witn a sweetness of disposition
and a charity towards all, which en
deared him to the many people he met
throughout his ministerial record. He
was literally a Eelf-made man.
His life was one long and well-spent.
His earnest efforts in behalf of his fel
low men and their welfare brought
their own reward, and since age laid
restraining hands upon him and he was
forced to give up active work, his fa
miliar figure about our streets and his
pleasant smile and hearty hand shake
will be missed by many.
llev. Clark was in the Methodist
Protestant ministry for over 40 years
and preached at the following charges:
Brockway Centre, Greenwood, Grant
Center, Metamora, Union circuit, La
peer, Goodland, Kinde, Hichlield, Har

Thanksgiving Ball.
All the plans and expectations and
hopes of a good time which nearly the
whole of Yale's population were exper
iencing in regard to the big ball, were
brought to a complete fulfillment
on Thanksgiving evening when the
new auditorium was opened to the
public, and 500 persons gathered to par
ticipate in the long looked forward to
and much talked of party.
As we have given descriptions of the
new building in other issues, we simply
say that it appears to be all complete
and one thing this city, has needed for
a long time. Bright with numerous
electric lights the big hall showed to
good advantage on this night when,
with the music of Einzels orchestra
calling, the floor was filled with dancers
enjoying to the utmost its alluring
strains.
Many who have not danced for years,
and others who only occasionally par
ticipate, mixed with the throng of
young people whose feet are never
still. The many spectators really
thought they had the best of it in
watching the pretly scene. The beaut
iful dresses, the bright faces, moving
in and out, now here, now there, the
music, made a picture one loved to
watch and the watchers stayed ai long
as the dancers,
During the evening supper was serv
ed in the basement, many taking ad
vantage of the call to appease their
hunger.
The opening ball wan successfully
carried out, and we htar the young
people are clamoring for auother, so it
is altogether likely one will be given at
the holiday time.
