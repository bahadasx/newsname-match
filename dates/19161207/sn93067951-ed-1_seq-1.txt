tat the cheery and courteous town
as issuing bonds, they immediately
int their representative, Mr. Tindell,
i the town on the ridge. They not
lly offered par value for the bonds,
it were so anxious to obtain some
;al gilt edge security on the town

as accepted, was $16,160.00, net, in

i addition to accrued interest for
r $16,000.00 worth of bonds.
To sum up, having a purchaser on
hand for bonds of the description to
be issued Hillsman & Company
made a very advantageous offer
to Mayor and Council for our town.
After going into the matter in detail
the officers accepted the offer whereby
Hillsman & Co. pay all expenses
incident to the issue of bonds includ;
ing engraving of bonds, al llegal fees
as to validity, etc. in addition to paying
101 cents on the dollar and acI
crued interest. The only reason that
the matter could be handled in this
way was that money is at present easier
than at an ytime since 1907, and
no matter how much bonds may fluctuate
in the future, the town is protected
at the contract price,
