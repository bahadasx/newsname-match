London, Dec. 7. Lloyd-George, the I est peace."
new prime minister, has opened ne
gotiations with the Labor .party with
the view of securing its support and
co-operation. At a meeting of the
party this morning regret was ex
pressed at the resignation of Premier
Asqulth, but it was decided to support
any government pledged to prosecute
the war and In which labor was ade
quately represented.
The consensus of opinion among
political correspondents Is that the
principal statesmen will be willing to
help Lloyd-George, but that he cannot
expect assistance from his own Lib-
eral colleagues.
The Chronicle, referring to the dif
ficulties of the new premier, says
"only a man of lion hearted courage
would confront them. He has no or
ganized following In' the House of
Commons and no party machine to
help him. But the very boldness of
the enterprise may win the sympathy
of the British democracy."
It Is believed the formation of a
new cabinet will be a matter of only I
a day or so. Some estimates give
