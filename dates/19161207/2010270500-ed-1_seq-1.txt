Your reporter gave a rather hard
"slam" at our loaning habit, in say
ing Sunday morning we had loaned
Frank Boyles, brought back from
Chicago, $200 on a motorcycle. It
was $20, some difference. Some
time it does no good to stir up these
matters, but already, we have been
criticised on this tor loose loaning,
when the opposite is the case, as we
had in addition a strong salary note
with power of attorney, authorizing
us to collect his wages, and we had
known him since a child over at

lice in locating her husband 6f a
week was sought yesterday by Mrs.
Ed Young, who lives at the Daven
port hotel. The couple were married
a week ago in Dakota City, Neb.
Mr. Young had been employed in
Hirst & Fladebo barber shop, 1015
Fourth street. It was the conten
tion of Mrs. Young that her husband
had deserted her. She said he had
taken a suit case with him to the
barber shop Saturday morning and
had not reappeared Charles
Youncr. 61 years old. who worked on
Missouri river steamboats in the
early 80s, died yesterday at Hubbard,
Neb., of pneumonia. Young came
to Sioux City in 1884 and lived here
continuously up to last January.
For the last twenty-five years he was
employed by Charles R. Selzer,
wholesale liquor dealer. The body
was brought to Sioux City last night
and taken to the Westcott undertak
ing rooms. He is survived by his
widow and two brothers, Henry
Young, of Kansas City, Mo., and
Nicholas Young, who lives in Ger
many. Mr. Young was a member
of Sioux City aerie No. 77, Frater
nal Order of Eagles, and the lodge
will be in charge of the funeral ser
vices. Sioux City Journal, 1st: Former
Circuit Judge R. E. Evans has been
retained by the Commercial club of
Dakota City, Neb., to combat the
action of the Chicago. St. Paul, Min
neapolis and Omaha railroad in abol
ishing train stops at Dakota City, on
the Norfolk branch line. A protest
signed by residents or the town will
be filed with the Nebraska state rail
road commission at once and Judge
Evans will petition the commission
ers for an immediate hearing. It is
probable that Judge Evans will act
in concert with City Attorney Ward
Evans, of South Sioux City, who will
file a similar protest in behalf of the
city council of that place. The city
council will frame its protest at a
meeting to be held next Tuesday
evening.... Organization of a com
pany to take over the operation of
the Combination bridge probably
will take place soon after the first of
the year, according to W. L. Selby,
ROSS
Nebraska
of Omaha, who purchased the struc
ture at a forced sale several months
ago. At the present time the title
of the entire holdings of the old
Combination Bridge comyany is vest
ed in Mr. Selby. The taking over of
the property by a corporation will
indicate whether the bridge will con
tinue to be a private enterprise or
bo controlled by the Burlington,
Union Pacific or some other railroad.
According to the articles of incor
poration of the Combination Bridge
company the annual meeting of the
stockholders should have been held
in October, but owing to the com
plications arising from the sale was
passed. It was stated yesterday by
former attorneys of the bridge com
pany that the old corporation had
ceased to exist and that nothing will
be done until Mr. Selby has formed
a new one. The business of tht
company continues to be managed
by F. L. Eaton, who was president
of the old company.
Ponca Journal: Ponca hu
school's claim to thechampionvpof
northeast Nebraska were nracica.ly
assured when they defeated the fast
Homer team here Saturday. Out of
five games played they have won 4
and tied 1.
At 3 o'clock Homer wus on the
field and ready to play. Ponca won
the toss and Homer kicked to them,
defending the west goal. Ponca ad
vanced the ball to the middle of the
field where they lost it&io Homer on
the fourth down, fiomer could
make no appreciable gain and the
ball was Ponca's on the 35-yard line.
The playing in the first quarter was
the luke warm variety neither
team being able to make a good
gain. In the second quarter Ponca
played real ball and by oft" tackle
runs took ball to Homer's five yard
line. Hines scored a touch down on
a line plunge, Adams kicked goal.
In the next five minutes Homer at
tempted a pass but Bray intercepted
it carrying it across for a second
touch down. Adams missed goal.
Homer was penalized for slugging
and offside. Heydon was called
through the line on a shift play and.
a third touch down was counted tor
the Indians. Adams again kicked
goal. In the second half, Homer
came back and held the Indians to
only one touch down. It was this
.quarter that Homer threatened to
cross Ponca's goal for the first time
this year, but the player was tack
led 10 yards from the goal, loosing
the ball on fumble. Ponca carried it
to within 10 yards of Homer's goal
but a penalty for slugging took the
gain away and the game ended 27 to
0 with the "Indians" holding the
long end. The team as a whole did
excellent work and in spite of the
two weeks rest without practice
proved their worth and ability to
stage a come back. By reason of
no defeat and comparative scores
Ponca can rightly lay claim to the
championship of northeast Nebraska.
The time of quarters was 10-12-10-12.

Looking Backward.
Sioux City Journal, Dec, 4, 189G:
John Orr, of Dakota City, was in
this market yesterday, contracting
for the purchase of cattle to feed
during the winter Nick Maher,
who owns and personally conducts
one of the largest farms in Dakota
county, was in town yesterday. He
said that one-half of the damage
done across the xiver by the late
storm had not 'yet been told. In
Emerson township alone, Mr. Maher
says, the damage will amount to
thousands, of dollars. Not only were
large numbers of fruit trees ruined
by the sleet which clung to the limbs
and broke them off, but nearly every
cottonwood and willow of respecta
ble size in the township was split by
the weight of the ice.
CIGIESSIONAL
,CuMMTTEE BEGINS
RAILWAY INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bet
ter Condition of Carriers,
MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM
Official of Roadi Prepartd to Advocate
Federal incorporation, Supervision of
Securities and Extension of Authority
of Interstate Commerce Commission.
Washington, Nov. 20. Ten members
of Congress, five Senators and live
members of the House of Representa
tives, began here today an Inquiry Into
the subject of public contr "m BU"
pervlslon of railroads that nXy lead to
tho revolutionizing of the whole scheme
of governmental regulation of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee Is to loo'? Into the ques
tlon of government o nershlp of rail
ways, telephono and telegraph lines
and express companies.
Tho members of tho commttteo
which will conduct this Important In
vestigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman; Senators Itoblnson
of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iown and Brandegeo of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amsou of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee,
Cullop of Indiana, Each of "Wisconsin
and Hamilton of Michigan. The in
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to Congress In
December of last year. He described
ob its purpose to determine what could
bo done "for bettering the conditions
under which tho railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all
Interests affected by the operations of
tho transportation lines the committee
has invited prominent shippers, bank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The flr'it to be heard are railroad
commissioners of various elates who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony is directed chleily to oppos
ing nny enlargement of tho federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will bo followed
shortly by ofllclals of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to tho increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in tl6 hearings cen
ters in tho proposals that will bo put
forward by representatives of the rail
roads, for It is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federal au
thority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of Btate control of
theso matters. It is, understood also that
they will go on record In favor of fed
cral incorporation of all railroad lines.
Legislative Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative Bourco is ob
tained tho following outline of the leg
islative program which tho railroads
will ftsk the committee to consider in
Us Investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
ono of tho principal defects in the pres
ent system of railroad regulation Is
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous aud conlllctlng regu
lation by the federal government and
by tho 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed In the hands of a federal
body so that interstate traffic may bo
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the stato commissions
Jurisdiction only over local matters aud
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan, a compulsory system of federal
incorporation Is to bo recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issues.
A reorganization of tho Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked,
in order to enable tho commission prop
erly to cxerclso its increased powers.
It Is also proposed that tho preparation
aud prosecution of cases against the
railroads shall be delegated to some
other agency 4t tho government, possi
bly tho Department of Justice, so that
tho commission may devoto its ener
gies to Us administrative functions.
AVlth the commission thus relieved
of sorao of its present duties and equip
ped to handle its business more prompt
ly, tho railroads will urge that the pe
riod during which Uie commission may
now suspend proposed increases In
rates bo reduced from ten months to
00 days, with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers if the ad
runce shall be declared unreasonable.
They will also usk thut the commis
sion bo given tho power to prescrlbo
minimum as well as maximum rates
so that In meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
tho advanco of a rate which it consid
ers too low.
Oiiq. of the moHtJmportaut jecom-
itieiiilntlotis for which tlio rnllroniTs
will nsk favorulilo consideration Is
twit the commission bo specifically
authorized to tnku Into account In
rnto regulation tho effect of rates
upon total earnings In tho light of ex
penses. While tho Newlands Committee Is
required, under the resolution creat
ing It, to submit a report by Jnnuary
2 next, it Is not anticipated that tbo
Coimulttco will have como nnywlicra
near completing Its labors then.

Short Course Instead of Institute
But a few more names ane need
ed to assure the short course for
Dakota county. Instead of tho reg
ular one day institute, there will be
five days in which regular courses
in agriculture will be offered. Prof.
K. E. Warner, who was formerly en
gaged in the Minnesota, university
and now with the University of Ne
braska, will handle the work with
the live slock. Mr. Warner is n
masttr in the art of butchering, cut
ting and caring of meats as well as
a specialist in the feed and care of
live stock. His connection with tho
short course is sure to insure unusu
al quality.
Prof. I. D. Wood, of the Depart
ment of Agricultural Engineering,
will have charge of thh farm mo
ters division. With tho ndvent of
so many tractors in this section and
the use of kerosene and gasoline as
feeds for farm power instead of corn
and oats, this feature should be of
especial interest. Professor Wood
will demonstrate with models of
different farm motors. Ho also re
quests any one who has had trouble
in getting engines started to bring
them in and he will find the trouble
and put them in runnning order be
fore the class.
To many of the ladies Miss Scott
needs no introduction. The high
class of her work in connection with
the Womens Rural Short Course last
summer will be remembered. The
work offered the women will be
more distinct and advanced as the
program will show. Miss Itokahr,
who will have charge of the foods
preparation and service, comes espe
cially well qualified. Tho women's
side of this short course is just as
strong as the men's and we hope
that it will be a grand succesa in the
point of interest and attendance.
Let al get together and boost to
make this the biggest event of tne
year. Read the announcements
next week.

A new nature study chart has been
purchased by tho school .board for
which tho teachers are very thank
ful. It is a gold mine of experience
for pupils of all grades. Mr. Wag
ner, tho man selling the chart, gave
an interesting talk to all the school
except the primary department, ex
plaining the use of the chart and ar
rousing the interest of the pupils in
the study of nature as the first and
most important study,
The last scheduled foot ball game
of the season was begun at Walthill
Thursday. Several car loads went
down to witness what was expected
to be tho best game of tho season.
Tho weather was very favorable and
our boys had never been in so good
condition and Dakota City people
generally were in high spirits. Tho
lio3 in blue and orange did their
part and every thing was in their
favor until.tho end of the first half.
Unfortunately two of tho Walthill
players were injured and taken out
of tho game. Walthill feigned to
have no substitutes and slipped in
two mert who had played on the State .
Farm team and had won honors.
Of couise this was a violation of the
spirit and intent of the game and
could not be tolerated by the Dakota
City team. No satisfactory substi
tution of players was mado and the
game ended at that point. The
scoro stood 27 to 0 in Dakota City's
favor, and the officials agreed that
the game could not bo forfeited.
The D. H. S. boys are to bo com
mended upon their conduct during
tho whole affair. They wero play
ing the game as they had not done
before, but their play was as clean
as ever it can bo played. A very
earnest effort has been made to
make the athletics of the high school
of the highest possible type. Wo
are far from satisfied with the
results, but are very confident that
an appreciable progress has been
made. Foot ball Bhould make men
of the strongest character or be ban
ished from the high school. We be
lieve our boys are stronger in every
respect because of their experience
in the contest. It is a moral crisis
for every boy to sacrifice Belf for the
good of the team and control his
temper and emotions that he may
not bring reproach upon his fellows.
We have had several adverse situa
tions this year, but not discouraged
by theso, we shall endeavor to make
them impossible for next year.
