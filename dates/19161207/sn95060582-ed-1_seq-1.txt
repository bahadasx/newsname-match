Apache Ranger Flashes Message Frorrf
White Mountains to Clifton.
Albuquerque, N. M., Nov. 28.
A message received here this
morning from District Forester
Redington, who is inspecting the
Apache National Forest in Arizo
na, states that a wireless message
was transmitted yesterday from
,the Baseline Ranger Station to
Clifton. The distance is forty
miles. This is believed to be the
first time that the wireless has
been used in transacting National
Forest business. .
The outfit was installed by For

CAPITAL FUMSHMENT
ABOLISHED IN ARIZONA
Next to .the prohibition amend
ment there was a greater degree
of public interest in the initiated
measure to abolish capital punish
mont'than in any of the other
propositions. The closeness of
the.race for the head of the ticket
was responsible for the slow count
on the amendments, but it was
reported at the capitol Saturday
that enough returns had been
complied to indicate that the
measure had been adopted by
about 500 majority and that legal
executions in Arizona are a thing
of the past.
Under the terms of the amend
ment "no person convicted of the
crime of murder shall be recom-

The transmittal of the message
demonstrates the practicability of
overcoming the heavy "static"

Southwest, and Forest officers
