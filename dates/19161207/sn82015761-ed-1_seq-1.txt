A NEAR FIRE ON
THIRD STREET, DEC. 4
At about 11 A. M. Tuesday
the weird scream of the fire
whistle was heard and in an in
stant the people of Williams
were on the qui vive to learn
the location of the fire. The
fire department very soon
learned the origin of the alarm
and were "Jonny on the spot"
The spot was a telephone pole
on Third street near the cor
ner of Hancock and Third St.
Some school children had dis
covered fire at the top of the
pole and called the atention of
Mrs. Morehead to it. Mrs.
Morehead called up the Water
Company and then proceeded
to put out the fire. When the
hose Qart arrived it was all
over.
Thru a break in the insula
tion of a wire at the top of the
pole the covering of the wire
was set on fire. A line ran in
to asmall vacant house near by
and fire was following this
wire rapidly and had almost
reached the house when Mrs.
Morehead dashed a bucket of
water onto it and put it out.
Except for a somewhat unus
ual combination of circum
stances, Williams might have
had a serious conflagration.
The time of day; school child
ren on the spot and cool and
prompt action by a resourceful
woman defeated the fire fiend.
HE FELL FROM THE
BATTLE SHIP
Mr. Bob Frankel of the Hopi
House, Grand Canyon, was in
Williams, Monday, to have his
hand treated. Bob claims that
he was climbing around the
Battle-ship, missed his footing
and stuck some cactus thorns
in his hand, which proved to
be. very painful. Williams
friends are very sorry for Bob
and hope he wont have to fall
from the Battle-ship again to
see the point. What was guide
Dillon doing at the time of the
descension?

CIPAL TREE FOR
WILLIAMS TRIS YEAR
W. P. L. A. Meets to Plan Mu
nicipal Christmas Tree $50
Appropriated by Council
Encouragement from Every
One Bigger and Better and
for ALL
Parliamentary rules were
not much in evidence at the
meeting of the Williams Pub
lic Library Association called
to consider the matter of a mu
nicipal Christmas tree, Tues
day night , but they did not
seem to be needed. The busi
ness of the meeting was suc
cessfully carried thru in a ve
ry informal manner. The pres
ident, Mrs. E. J. Nordyke, per
mitted each to have his or her
say without restraint and the
outcome of the discussion was,
committees well organized to
arrange for a municipal Christ
mas tree to be presented to the
Williams public without dis
tinction of race, color, social
standing or religious or politi
cal creed?
The attendance at this meet
ing of the library association
was good and the most gener
ous and friendly spirit prevail
ed thruout. The enthusiasm
for a municipal Christmas tree
was unbounded. Each and ev
eryone consented willingly to
perform the part assigned to
him or her. After a general
discussion of last year's enter
tainment which was highly
praised by all, the meeting got
down to business and it was not
long in completing the work of
organization for this year's en
tertainment. So successful did
all seem to think the program
of last year, that the only hope
expressed was that this year's
program might be as successful
and it was the general wish
that the entertainment to come
should be conducted on the
same lines. The suggestion
that work be lessened by a
good picture show was finally
rejected, it being thot that the
children would furnish more
satisfactory entertainment and
delight in doing it.
The following committees
were selected to carry out ar
rangements for the Christmas
tree entertainment. Executive
committee : W. M. Hughes, E.
J. Nordyke and F. R. Ferguson
with power to call in all need
ed assistance; Committee on
program, Miss Bertha Peet
with power to call on others to
assist; Mr. Geo. L. Barnes was
selected to have charge of the
room. Mrs. R. C. Wente was
selected to succeed herself as
treasurer to act with the com
mittee on finance consisting of
Mrs. W. M. Hughes and Mrs.
James Kennedy, and with the
executive committee. A mo
tion was made at one time by
Mr. Ferguson that the teachers
of the public school have
charge of the program. The
motion was not seconded, but
it seemed to be assumed that
the teachers would act in that
capacity, and they, doubtless,
will.
While arrangements were
under discussion the executive
committee begged to be excus-j
ed to call on the Town Council
then in session and ask for an
appropriation for the Christ
mas tree. The committee was
very successful. It had hardly
been missed when it reappear-

ed and reported that the Coun
cil had granted$50 on behalf of
the Town.
Mrs. Wente the outgoing as
well as the in-going treasurer
read her financial statement.
There is on hand at present a
fund of nearly $60 left over
from last year which is avail
able for this year's Christmas
tree. $236 was collected last
year and $177.18 spent. The
feeling was general that the
amount necessary for a suc
cessful entertainment this year
would be easily raised.
An important motion made
by Miss Peet was adopted just
before adjournment. Miss
Peet moved that at the busi
ness meeting to be held soon
after the entertainment, com
mittees be appointed to ar
range for a municipal tree for
1917. The meeting was then
declared adjourned.
MISS BIGGER AND PUPILS
GIVE EXCELLENT RECITAL
Miss Bigger's class in music
furnished a pleasing program
last Saturday afternoon for her
patrons. These little folks are
being properly directed along
the study of the lives and com
positions of the great artists in
the music world. Thus, in time
they will develop a taste for
proper and not popular music.
The following program was
rendered, after which delicate
refreshments were served.

New Hampshire is indicated by
the' fact that Wilson got 43,-
779 and Mr. Hughes got 43,
723. Republican candidates
have petitioned for a recount.
Will Use Mock Inaugral Cer

Oath of Office
Williams democrates are
planning to have mock inaug
ral ceremonies March 5 and in
augurate Woodrow Wilson
President of the United States
for a second term. Committees
will be appointed to prepare
for the occasion. Mr.Davenport
will personate the president
and take the oath adminster
ed by Judge X. N. Steeves, who
will personate : Chief Justice
White most fittingly. The
members of the presidents cab
inet will participate in the in
augural ceremonies. Their per-
sonators will be selected by
committee.
Williams democrats are de
termined to make their mock
inaugral ceremonies ( complete
to the minutest detail and of
course the inaugral ball will be
a strong and unquestionably a
popular feature. Williams
lays down to no one when it
comes to tripping the lightfan
tastic and to stage the ball in
which American and foreign
notables and digitaries tread
the measures of this national
function will be the least of.
committee troubles. Williams
gentlemen and ladies will easi
ly meet all demands and ap
pear on the waxed floor with
becoming grace and ease.
The selection of personators
will be made in due time so
that they may become familiar
with their respective parts. Mr.
Davenport, president by per
sonation, has taken a few days
vacation from the duties of his
position with the Postal and it
has been hinted that while
gone he wil give consideration
to his inaugural address.
There is no lack of talent
among Williams democrats to
fill every office creditably and
the public may expect a rare
treat in the mock inaugural
ceremonies which they will
conduct. It is likely it is as
near the real thing as most of us
will ever witness or take part
in.
Blasting way to shaft
Mr. J. S. Amundsen, corner
of Third and Hancock, is doing
some pretty heavy work to
connect his house with a sewer
shaft. The toughest kind of
rock is being met with and the
workmen have had to resort to
blasting. The trench of the
small connecting sewer has
been put down to a depth of
something like six feet.
