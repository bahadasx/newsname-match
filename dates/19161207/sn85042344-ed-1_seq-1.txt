iiiiiiiIii, litis Is'i-n ruptured, It was of
ficially announced today.

The fall of the Rumanian strong
holil has lieen liourly rxpcctcil fir the
lust two (lays. News that the German
armies, within seien mill's of (he city,
hud eonimeiiceil a iKmiburdnu'iit of
Ihicliurcst made It seem certain thai
the capital was doomed.
Tlie capture of Ploetehtl, on the
nikln lino runniii;; north from Bucha
rest, uIh t ho mum railway lino of the
Rumanian armies operating In the
Buchercst region.
The official statement does not In
dicate whether tho entry of the Teu
tonic forces Into Bucharest and
1'loeehti was simultaneous. The cap-1
ture of 1'loerhtt before that of the
capital would Lo far more periods for
tho J!un;anlani!. Many military oh
servers looked for the Rumanians not
to attempt i defense of tho capital to
the Inst, expecting on evacuation In
time to nave tho forces defending It
liy r withdrawal of the railway route
remaining to them. '"' !
Conquest Is Complete.
The taking of Bucharest virtually
completes the conquest liy tho Teu
tonic forces of the southern section of
the Kumanlan kingdom, embracing
territory of more than 60,000 square
miles.
The rnpturo of liurharost marks
the culmination of an operation ac
counted by military commentators
one of the most soundly conceived
and brilliantly executed strategical
feats of the groat war.
From the hour when Field Marshal
von Mackonscn forced a crossing .of
tho Danube and on November 24 set
foot en Kumanlan soil, effecting a
Junction hhortly afterward with Gen
eral von Fiilkonhuyn's armies, driv
ing thru Wallachla from the west,
thirc F.eemed little doubt of the ulti
mate fate of the Rumanian capital.
Teuton Pressure Overwhelming.
The relentless pressure of the Teu
tonic Invading armies, with their pre
ponderance of heavy artillery, proved
too much for King Ferdinand's forces
once the Rumanian front was broken
In western Wallachl.i and the Danube
crossed behind the line 'of tho north
ern Teutonic Interruption. Obviously
outflanked on the south by Von Muo
kmsen's advanco nnd on thn north
by further AiiHtro-Oermnn interrup
tions, thru the mountain passes, the
Itumunlans had no choice but to fall
back noon the line of their capital and
now have been orced to yield even
that.
The beginning of the Teutonic cam
paign against Rumania dates back
the Rumanian entrance Into tli3
war on August 27. Perhaps taken y
surprise by tho rapidity with whPn
the Rumanians threw their troaps
across the Trunsylvunlun Alps into
Hungary and took possession of
Kronsladt, llerrnmnnstadt and a
wide sweep of Hungarian territory,
the Austro-Oerninn military authori
ties were awake to the opportunities
In Dobrudjn on the Rumanian south
east front.
Unitarians Stall Campaign.
Within a few days tho Bulgarians
were found to bo winning signal suc
cesses along the Danube, capturing
Turtiikul on September 7 nnd Silis
trla on the 10th. There remained
then the operation of clearing tho re
mainder of Dobrudju up to the Im
portant railway line running from tho
lllnclt sen port of Constiinzn Into In
terior Rumania over tho bridge at
Tchernavodu. This Von Maekensen
accomplished something more than
h month later, defeating the Russo
Rumanlan army and capturing the
lallwav. thus shutting olf Bucharest
fioni direct rail communication with
the mack pea and cutting tho most
convenient line for sending Russian
reinforcements nnd supplies Into llu
mania. The Nutcracker In I'luy.
This accomplished, there began the
process of crushing Rumania In the
nutcracker fashion, made famous hy
the Germans In this war. First, the
Rumanians were pushed back to their
frontier on tho north. This was
easily accomplished, as the Invaders
of Hungary were apparently III
equlppod to hold their ground. Gen
eral von Fiilkenhayn, In charge of this
operation, then began hammering at
tho passes thru tho Transylvanlan
Alps, which It was necessary to carry
to reach the Rumnnlan plain. The
Rumanians, assisted In some cases by
the Russians, tenaciously defended
these passes and their approaches,
hut all along the line the Teutonic at
tack progressed and finally on No
vember 18 came the vital break In
the Rumanian line. This occurred In
the upper Jlul valley when von Falk
enhayn won the great battle of Tlrgu
J ill and opened the way to the plains
of l.lltln Wallachla.

Tho Rumunlan retreat east wart,
wus in full swing by this time when
suddenly came tho news that vim
Maekensen, who had been marshal
ing a big army in Dobrudja, had ef
fected a crossing of the Danube at
several points, olio of them at Zim
nitza, turning the position the Ru
manians had taken up along the Alt
river after their retreat from the .1 ml.
From then on events moved raplly.
Von .Maekensen, capturing (iiuigiu
on the Danube, passed up to the rail
read line, thence toward llucharest.
and the urniics from the west and
ncrth, winning many engagements
that permitted tho infiux of additional
forces thru the passes, fought their
way to tho line of the Argechu.
Itrcak Mst Line.
Tliis line was broken In a great bat
tle on December 3 In which the first
Rumanian army was badly defeated,
and then begun falling back eastward
in disorder. Tho Auslm-dermim
urniics were nearing the capital on
three sides and at no point except on
the south meeting really effective re
sistance. Even to the south it was
announced on Tuesday that they had
worked within seven miles of the
capital, which had boon reported un
der bombardment for several days and
Its evacuation by tho Rumanians was
hourly looked for.
Fourth capital to Full.
In entering llucharest the armies of
tho central powers have taken their
fourth entente capital. F.arly in the
war Klnir Albert and the Uelgian gov
ernments were forced out of Brussels
nnd last year King I'eter of Serbia
nnd King Nicholas of Montenegro
were successively compelled to give
up their capitals to the Teutonic in
vaders Now tho process has been re
lated In the case of King rcrdinnnu
of Rumania. Huehirest hctore the
present war relegated old-fashioned
fortifications to the scrap heap was
considered extremely well defended by
Its outlying works, which comprised
eighteen fortifications of the first
di ss and many redoubts nnd batter

counted probably the largest military
camp In the world, capable of ucconi
mrdatlng two hundr.'d thousand men.
The city is a gay capital in peace

to as '"the I'.iris of the east.- It cov

Liberalist Leader Assumes
Charge When Asked to
Form New Cabinet.
BONAR LAW WILL AID HIM
New Government Will Re
Coalition; Believe Any
Party Rule Impossible.
LONDON, Dec. C (II p. in.) David
Lloyd-tleorgc has overthrown tho
Asquith cabinet and will become
prime minister himself.
Tlio new government will be coali
tion like the old one, but probably
without Hie samo measure of har
monious support which attended the
formation of the first coalition cabinet
beacuse its birth has created addi
tional factional differences.
This result has emerged from an
other day of uetive and hurried party
conferences and a day of intense sus
pense and interest thruout the
country.
At King's Conference.
There was a prospect this afternoon
that the personal offices of the king
might solve the situation any many
thnt that the Asquith regime might
be continued. The king called the
party leaders to Buckingham palace
and conferred with them for more
than an hour. Mr. Asquith and Mr.
I.lnyil-tieorge of the Liberals, Mr.
Bonar-I.aw nnd Mr. Balfour of the
Colonists and Mr. Hend q-son of the
labor party were with the sovereign.
It is meny years since a British
ruler asomblcd the representatives of
tlio different factions fane to face
when they had shown themselves un
able to settle their differences. But
no such serious crisis has arisen be
fore to require such action by tho
king.
.Secrecy Maintained.
Whatever passed in tho council Is
held secret, but the inference that the
king tried to arrange a reconciliation
appears a most natural one, I ho five
statesmen departed separately, four
In their motor curs anil the working
men's spokesman afoot. Afterwards
the king guvo un audience to Mr.
Bonar-Luw, who declined to under
take tho formation ef a new ministry,
nnd then to Mr. Lloyd-Oeorge, who
accepted tho responsibility as every
one anticipated he would if tho op
portunity came to him.
To lie Coalition.
The official announcement tonight
that Mr. Lloyd-Oeorge had under
take tlio tusk with the co-operation
of Mr. Donar-l-aw was u notification
Unit tho new government would be
cotilition. Any party government
would be impossible because neither
tho Colonists nor tho Liberals have a
majority In the house, of commons;
either one must attach the Irish Na
tionalists or the Iiborites to itself to
command n majority. The National
ists have refused to participate in the
government until home rule becomes
established. The Iiborltes are sworn
enemies to Mr. Lloyd-Oeorge because
they resent his accusations that the
workliigmen have put their personal
interests above the national interests
nt times during tho war.

today settled down to consideration
of tho Owen corrupt practice bill to

Senator Owen said informally he
would withhold for tho present at

JIM DAVENPORT
FILES CONTEST
Defeated Congressman
Charges Own Party Offi
cials With Fraud.
CHANDLER IS NOT SURPRISED
Republican Representative
Klect Says He Expected
Beaten Man to Kick.
Attempting to thwart the will of
thousands of members of his own
parly, and accusing Democratic rice,
lion officers of crimes that would
send them to the penitentiary. James
S. Davenport I, as filed with the bouso
of representatives a contest against
seating Hon. T. A. Chandler, Repub
lican, who was elected to congress
ftom tins district. It was learned hero
yesterday.
In ull there are somo twenty
charges, but not one of them contains
a specific allegation of wrong-doing
on thn part of Mr. Chandler. It is
tine he claims Hand among members
of the county election boards, but thn
majority of ull boards In this state are
Democratic, and a vigorous protest
went up iioni Democrats in Tiil.su
when the action of Davenport became
known. Thousands of them voted
against him in order to re, novo from
politics a maii of bis character, and
they recent not only his efforts to
thwart Hie will of tho better element
of the Democratic party, but they nro
outspoken In condemnation of Daven
port's accusation against members of
their parly who me sworn election
ameers, und who huvo always born
good reputations.
Charges in Contest.
In the first charge, Davenport's ac
cusation reads: 'But that contestes
(Cbandlerl Is not now and was not at
tho time of said election possessed of
all quallfactions by law for said of
flee." But what qualifications are
neccsury, Davenport falls to slate.
Secondly, he says "Because on
thousand or more votes alleged to
have been cast ami counted for said
conlestee were Illegal and unlawfully
counted." There is where ho takes a
rap at the Democratic members of tho
election board, In charges that. If
proven, would send them to tho peni
le Hilary.
Counted Wrong, Claim.
Tho third charge "because some of
thi! judges and clerks failed to count
live hundred or more votes legally
cast for contestant." He apparently
wants to have bis counted In any old
way. but not Chandler's at all.
Fourth, "Because In precincts 2 to
6 in the city of Tulsa, and 9, H, 15
ami 17 in the city of Tulsa ami pre
cincts 2 ami 3 In Linn Ijino and 1 In
Woliwa nnd 21 in the county of Tulsa
anil other precincts In said county
Ihren hundred or more fraudulent and
unlawful voles were cast nnd counted
for the eonteslee. (Another rap at
the Democratic officials.)
Fifth charge Is a repetition of tho
fourl h.
In the sixth be charges the Judges
and clerks conducting the election of
not being duly qualified ami sworn
to In twenty-one of the county and
ten of the city.
Intimidation Charged.
Charge seven claims that some of
the city police were stationed and the
precincts and "Interfered with, spoke
to, solicited and attempted to Intimi
date voters." (Get that, will you?)
Kighih, "Bec.niso the polls were
closed ut the precinct at the city hull
111 the city of Tulsa contrary to law
und before 7 o'clock, thereby 'prevent
ing voters who desired to east their
ballots from so doing." Good thing
for Davenport the polls did close, as
be says, or Chandler's majority would
have been double what It was In that
precinct.
Nino licenses men of voting who
were not legally entitled to' vote In
the cltv of Tulsa and wero unlawfully
permitted to register. Again he ac
cuses Democrats of violation of law
tlie registrars.
In i barge ten he accuses Chandler
of using money and promises of of
fice. Kb yen, same ns ton.
Ids-alls World Articles.
The twelfth charge Is the longest
nnd perhaps tho most interesting "In
less than 4H hours prior to election,"
It goes, "there was published by and
w il Ii your consent, anil ndvrco article
In The Tulsa Dally World, wi'lful, ma.
liebius and base falsehoods which
wire known to you to be false, will
ful and malicious, and were published
by your consent solely for the pur
iom' ef fraudulently and maliciously
misleading tlie voters and causing
them not to vote for contestant, sole
ly and only for the purpose of seeur
lug contcstoe's election, nil known to
you nt tlie time to be false."
Thirteen pertains to Rogers county
and ward 4, Cbiremore, und Is tho
same ns those made hguinst Tulsa
county election officials.
l otirteeii. the same as thirteen.
l lfteon claims there wete 2u0 Il
legal votes in Rogers count v which
should have been counted for con
testant, but wero counted tor eon
testi'i'. Sixteen appertains to frauds In tho
Vote and count in Nowata c imtv. In
which Hickory township is specific,
n 1 1 y mentioned, und the report con
tinues "and Hi1 same occurred In sev.
era I other precincts In said county."
Claims n Majority.
Seventeen claims Chandler did not
receive the hl'-'hest number of legal
votes In the election and that the con.
tistant did. and "because certain
Judges and clerks In the several pre
cincts In Tulsa city und the First con
gressional district were not legally
qualified, and especially is this true
In precincts 10 and '.'I In city of Tulsa
and otler precincts In the county
were not properly certified to nor
ware the Judges and clerks properly
qualified to act as such."
F.lghtcon makes the same claims
about Pawnee county nnd the town
I of Cleveland as charge 17.
Nineteen Is u reiteration of IS nml
pit tains to warj 4 of Cbiremore.
Recount Sought.
Davenport asks for a recount of all
ballots In all precincts thruout tho
district which have been mentioned In
itlie different charges "so tjwit tint
