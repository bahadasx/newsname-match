Cuthbert Delivered
Memorial Address
Annual Memorial Services Held By
Local Elks Sunday—Devils Lake
Attorney Eloquent
On the first Monday of each De
cember solne fourteen hundred Elks
lodges throughout the United States
hold their memorial services for
their departed brothers and this oc
casion was fittingly observed by Wil
liston lodge No. 1214 last Sunday af
ternoon at three o'clock. The pro
gram of exercises was well attended
by members of the lodge and other
citizens, of the city and surrounding
towns. The service is indeed beauti
ful and a fitting tribute to the mem
ory of the
dead.
The Williston lodge was very for
tunate in securing Hon. F. T. Cuth
bert of Devils Lake to deliver the
memorial address. Mr. Cuthbert is
recognized as one of the best extem
poraneous speakers in the Northwest
and his effort of Sunday more than
fully sustained his reputation.
Just after the Devils Lake attor
ney had accepted the invitation of
the local Elks he was invited to de
liver the memorial address before St.
Paul lodge No. 59. Williston Elks
are congratulating themselves on se
curing talent that was 'sought by a
lodge like No. 59.
The eloquent discourse heard at
"The Home'' Sunday will long be re
membered bv those so fortunate as to
be present.. The orator touched
forcefully on the patriotism that is
instilled into the heart of every Elk.
His presentation of the ideals of the
order was masterly. His beautiful
eulogy on the absent brothers of the
lodge gripped the heart strings of all
who heard it.
ENTERTAIN AT LIBRARY HALL
Library Hall was the scene of a
pleasant gathering Ttresday after
noon when Mrs. W. J. Kelly and Mrs.
N. B. Ludowese delightfully enter
tained about sixty of their friends at
a Bluebird party. Chrysanthemums
and bluebirds formed the decorations
and music was furnished by Profes
sor Onstad's orchestra. Thi after
noon was spent in playing cards and
sewing after which a dainty supper
was served.
Martin Loughland
Burled at Hofflund
Funeral" services for Martin
Laughland, who died- at his home in
Nesson Valley, Nov. 29, were held
December 1st. There was a large
attendance of the people of the com
munity. The pastor o£ the Hofflund
Lutheran church conducted the ser
vices and preached the funeral ser
mon. Interment was made in the
Hofflund cemetery.
Martin Laughland was born at
Quadring, Lincolnshire, England in
the year 1850. He came to this coun
try twelve years ago and has spent
most of the time in Nesson valley
developing his 320 acre farm. His
death at the comparatively early age
of €6 was a shoek and a source of
sorrow to his many friends and neigh
bors..
Gave Shower For
December Bride
A. surprise shower for Miss HeJen
Oveson, a bride of the month, was
given Tuesday evening by Miss Mar
garet Monroe, Miss Lena Crow, Miss
Clara Newton and Miss May Bell at
the home of Miss Crow. The occasion
proved a most happy one and was
a complete surprise for Miss Oveson,
who was enticed to the scene and as
she entered the darkened room, Miss
Monroe played a wedding march. The
lights were turned on suddenly re
vealing a jolly party of the court
house girls and others of her friends.
Many gifts of cut glass, hand painted
china and linen wore showered on the
bride-elect, who is one of the most
popular voung ladies of the city and
has long been a member of the court
house force. At the end of a pleas
ant evening a delicious lunch was
served.
MUNICIPAL BUSINESS
At the regular Monday evening
meeting of the city commission the
routine of bills was allowed, final
payment made to the contractors for
the White Way job, and a partial
payment made on the street gravel
ing.
The Commercial club and the city
commission are cooperating in plans
to have about a mile of the "lane
road" leading north from town, sur
faced with gravel. It was the inten
sion to have ^Foster & Hanna, who
are doing the street graveling, do
this work, but the snow may prevent
its being done before spring.
BRIDGE IS AGAIN
IN COMMISSION
The pontoon bridge after being
kept open several days as a precau
tion against floating ice is again in
place. The river is frozen over ex
cept for a few short stretches and it
is hoped that ice trouble is over for
this rail.

RE-usniurOF
S.
II.
A zone of rates for second class
matter is' being prominently urged
to take the place of the present flat
rate which was adopted nearly forty
years ago. The present rate has
for some time been regarded as a
discrimination against the newspa
pers in favor of the great national
magazines. Like the parcel post the
proposed zone rates would be based
on the length of the haul.
The postal committees have peen
besieged by petitions bearing mil
lions of names and several hundred
thousand letters from individuals
urging a readjustment of postal rates
with a view of making possible one
cent letter postage. A survey of the
situation indicates that sufficient
changes will be made in the various
rates to permit the granting of a 1
cent rate on local delivery ietters in
the next session of Congress.
Chairman Moon of the House Pos
tal Committee, said: "I think that
the Committee will take up this sec
ond-class mail matter at the next ses
sion and press it to a conclusion at
once. While I cannot speak for the
committee, this is my desire in the
matter. I do not know what kind of
a bill we will pass, whether it will
have a zone feature attached to it or
not. This view has been presented
frequently in years past, and some
times received favor and sometimes
not. ,, Ar to what ihape the legislation
will be in I am npt able to say, but 1
am sure the Committee will give it
the best possible shape in the publir
interest."
Senator Clapp, of Minnesota, said
"Legislation creating a postage rate
of one cent on local delivery letters
should be enacted by Congress with
out any further delay. In view of
the nervous condition of business
throughout the country I believe the
reduction of the local letter rate from
2 cents to one cent would serve a very
valuable purpose by stimulating the
commercial situation to a more satis
factory level."
Congressman Stafford, of Wiscon
sin, one of the leading postal experts
in the House, has given extensive
study to the question of postal rev
enues and he firmly believes that
there is even large profit to the Gov
ernment with the reduced rates as
provided by his bill for 1 cent local
delivery letters. He said that "with
the inauguration of a one cent local
delivery postage the merchants and
people generally, who use the mails
so frequently for local delivery, will
be induced to utilize the mails still
more by reason of the reduction of
the rate."
Congressman Royal C. Johnson, of
South Dakota, "The advocates of 1
cent letter postage have succeeded in
educating the patrons of our postal
service to the realization that the
existing rates are far from being
equitable and that the time is oppor
tune for a change. It seems almost
certain that the members of the
House will have an opportunity of
oting on a proposition to extend the
American people a cheaper rates on
lelivery leters in the next session of
Congress.''
RETURNS~FROM BUSINESS TRIP
W. A. Garrison, proprietor of the
Boston store returned from his
eastern business trip Sunday morn
ing. Mr. Garrison visited Chicago,
Detroit and Milwaukee, and laid in
large stock of ladies and children-,
furnishings. At Milwaukee, Mr.
Garrison visited J. D. Wolpert for
merly of this city who is engaged
in the 5 and 10 cent business and do
ing well, Mr, Garrison says the
prices of everything are tending up
ward. In many lines he found it
difficult to supply his needs at any
price. Sneaking of the H. C. L.
question lie says that potatoes in
Wisconsin, a potato state, are retail
ing at $2.00 a bushel.
GREAT MEXICAN PICTURE
"The Patriot" shown at the Or
pheum Monday and Tuesday was a
photoplay with a plot built around
the stirring scenes at the border.
Thrilling from the first scene to the
last and well designed to present the
condition of affairs in Mexico, "The
Patriot" was one of the most enter
taining and instructive pictures that
a local audience has seen. William
Hart in the role of the patriot was
well suited to the part and does some
clever acting.
MARRIED
December 5th, Paul Jeffrey Howell

Rev. N. E. Elsworth at the Episcopal

ZONE SYSTEM FOR MAGA
ZINES CONSIDERED
Washington, Dec. 4—The ways are
now being greased for the launching
of the movement for the readjust
ment of postal rates in the next ses
sion of Congress. This problem was
to have been taken up in the last ses
sion but had to be deferred on ac
count of the consideration required
by railway mail pay. Since this has
been disposed of the committees are
prepared to take up the matter of
placing the various postal rates on a
more equitable basis.
ASKS FOR MEASURE
10 PROTECT PUBLIC
LADD'S BULLETIN PROVES NEED
REGISTRATION OF PATENT
MEDICINES
Not all patent medicines are fakes,
but a large number of those adver
tised are fakes of the worst kind.
Secrecy makes it possible to mis
lead and deceive the public
Charlatans and quacks reap tre
mendous wealth through their ability
to persuade the public to buy their
fake potions.
Dr. Ladd asks the adoption by
North Dakota of a registration act
similar to that for the registration of
beverages.
Ho lists over 500 patents analyz
ed by the North Dakota puie food
department, and finds that many of
them are frauds of the worst kind
many are poisonous others are
harmless, ana still others are trade
of cheap products on which the man
ufacturers reap tremendous profits.
Seventy per cent of the so-called
patent medicines or nostrums found
on the shelves of the average drug
a tores are practically worthless or are
simply fakes and a means of draw
ing money from suffering humanity
without giving any real benefit.
That assertion is made by Dr. E.
I.add, pure food commissioner and
president of the North Dakota Agri
cultural college, in a bulletin just is
sued.
1'r. Ladd lists, in his bulletin, a
tot:il of over 600 preparations, from
cough medicines to face powder, and
in each instance, he reveals the actual
ingredients that go to make up the
so-called "medicine," with such ap
pended remarks as "fraud," "poison,''
''harmless," "has no real value," or
"'improperly labeled," and a group of
others equally indicative of the ac
tual contents of the nostrum.
Wonderous Faith
"Because some man advertises that
in far away Africa, South America,
Mexico, or some missionary in India,
some heathen tribe of cannibals in
nterior New Zealand, has a remedy
rjet is a 'sure ^ure," it in sufficient
basis for many people to believe that
these products are possessed of great
virtue and will ensure a 'cure' for the
ailments from which they are suffer
ers. Usually, the most of the nos
trums so advertised are worthless
preparations," says Dr. Ladd.
"Secrecy makes it possible to mis
lead and deceive the public. Because
preparation is secret unknown in
composition to the public, it must
oossess some virtues or there would
be no need to keep it a secret, seems
to be the thought of many. This
-nables those eharlatans who desire
»o do so, those quack physicians, those
failures in every walk of life, gifted
with ability to persuade the public
into purchasing their wares, to take
ome old preparation, some discredit
ed drug, or some common remedy and
xploit it under a fanciful name, or
to become the pliant tool, 'stool pig
eon' for some long-faced hypocrite
and perhaps accummulate greas
wealth, for there are scores who
have thus succeeded. The patent
medicine industry with all its fakes
ar.d quackery dies hard.
There is No "Cure-All"
"There is no 'cure-all or 'shot gun
remedy, and there are many diseases
that are recognized by our best phy
sicians as being, so far as any known
medicine is concerned, incurable, and
co
far as is known to the able.st phy
sicians of bur time. Then, why do
we expect that some ignorant, illiter
ate vendor of drugs, some unsuccessful
horse doctor, or a p'a.-k. should ir.ak-e
a discovery that is going to prove a
'cure-all' for suffering humanity"
'Until every rosvu-m and pate:
medicine carries a label that shows
the true composition of the same, v/c
shall have fraud and deceptive prac
tice we shall trade upon ill health
and the suffering of humanity that a
few may profit by the injury to those
who should have the best advices and
guidance that can come from medical
skill.
"I have no sympathy with that
bunch of patent medicine vendors,
quacks, and nostrum agents who
swarm our state, invade the halls of
legislation, influence the newspapers
through their advertising columns,
and tntis deliberately deceive and mis
lead the people but there can be no
elief until public sentiment demands
that there be honesty and decency In
the sale of this class of products or
in the practice of quacks who how
thrive, all too plentifully, not through
norance but through a lack of cour
se for what is known to be right.
"North Dakota is now tolerably
free from adulterated food products.
Injurious forms of adulteration have
been driven out. Our food law has
been efficient for the purpose. The
drugs dispensed in the drugstores
are vastly improved. Spurious whis
kies are no longer generally found
in the state. Our beverages, pops,
sodas, etc., while not always to be
commended for continuous drinking,
contain no harmful ingredients.
No State Has Protection
"Not a state in the union thus far
has a law that can cope with these
oreparations. Shall they continue to
be the master, or shall we have laws
tha will force the fraudulent prepara
tions off the market and afford proper
protection to those which might have

place in the home? Public senti
ment must determine what shall be
done. The food department of North
Dakota asks that there be enacted a

Live Stock Special
First of Its Kind
Williston Delegation Joins Train At
Grand Forks—400 Take Trip
Well Entertained
The Live Stock Special Excursion
train which left Grand Forks on Mon
day night for Chicago, and which is
now parked withtin a few rods of
the International Live Stock show in
Chicago, is the first train of its kind
in history. It carried to the big
show some 400 North Dakota men
who took the two thousand mile trip
for the sole purpose of visiting the
greatest live stock exhibition on the
continent, getting in touch with the
best varieties of stock and the best
methods of caring for animals, and
availing themselves of a number of
sources of information enroute, es
pecially at St. Paul and Madison,
where arrangements had been made
for stops of an entire day in each
place.
The assemblage was made at Grand.
Forks on Monday evening, Decem
ber 4. Early trains from all direc
tions brought excursionists from
Williston, Minot, Devils Lake, and
from practically all intervening
towns and from every branch line,
and the final arrangements for the
trip, sale of tickets, distribution of
buttons and badges and other datas,
were handled in the Grand^ Forks
Commercial Club offices, which had
been turned over for that, purpose.
The visitors were 'entertained by the
local Commercial Club and the Mer
chants' Association. Dinner was
served in the club rooms to early ar
rivals, and those on later trains wei'e
given dinner in the Elk's f!!u! rooms
upstairs. After the dinne:* about
two hours were spent in visiting.
There was no formal program, but
just a .jolly time, in which old friends
greeted each other, new acquaintances
were formed, and the excursionists
were sent on their way with the good
wishes of their temporary hos-ts.
This excursion, the first of its kind,
will undoubtedly be the forerunner of
others in succeeding years, for there
is a growing appreciation of the good
that may be derived from such a trip,
which will benefit both the individual
and the state.

rest and is anxious to make settle
ment with the banks holding mort
gages against his property, but de
sires to do so without returning to
North Dakota. The deputy sheri.f
wired the banks to find if such an
arrangement was possible. The sher

make a business settlement and Strom
is waiting to hear from the local
parties who are interested.
Roe. before leaving this country,
lived in the Buford vicinity instead of
near Ray as was stated last week.
