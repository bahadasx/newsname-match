New9 From the Lively Toivnup North
Ar.o you beginning to feel the holl
day spirit 'stealing Into your eon-1
sclousneaa? I pity the naturo that
la too materialized to feel, enjoy and
anticipate with the gladness the ap
proach of tha most sacred day.
Christmas. Have they no childhood
momorlea to cherish In with this
event? Very often we And parents
who aro too much absorbed In world
ly cares to give heed to holiday
occasions and you hear them gay
they have no time for celebrations,
no time to enjoy tho beauties of na
ture, no tlmo for social frivolities,
no tlmo io spend In making their
fellow men happy, in fact they have
no time (for anything but Just theTr
dally mechanical routine of ' duties.
Such people miss the sweetmeats of
llfo and worse, they deprive their
children of tho inspiration of the
power to enjoy tho most beautiful
side of life and they In Urn become
mechanical diudges. Now lot us live
and enjoy all we can and teach our
children to do llkowise, that Is tho
I Puller Life."

NATION IN MIDST
OF CELEBRATING
ELECTRICAL WK.
.
Having pressed tho button-Milcc-trlcally
speaking tho Nation has
summoned Its gonle to a special colo
bratlon In said gonle's honor. In
othor words, America's Electrical
Weok Is now In full swing and from
every nook and cornor of tho country
comes a reflection of tho radlanco
porpotuated by this modem Alad
din, who makes the old Arabian
Nights hero look like a tallow dip
beside a "100-watt oloctrlc globo."
There aro any numbor of things
about electricity that aro not gener
ally known and the Society for Elec
trical Development has sont out some
figures that speak for thomselvos as
to the progress of oloctrlclty and the
great promlso for tho future.
At present there la a sum of $7,
909.8C2.157 Invested In electrical In
dustry, including railways, telephone
and telegrnphs.
$80,000,000 Is oxpondod each year
to sell electric service.
Enough hydro-electric energy Is
going to waste to equal the dally la
bor of 1.800,000,000 men or 30 times
tho adult population of tho country,
according to Secretary of tho Inter
ior, Franklin J. Lane.
Ono electrical horsepower will do
tho work of ton men without tir
ing. That Is, ono olectrlcal horso
power continuously operated does as
much work as thirty men working In
olght hour shifts.
And yet these enormous figures
rnlyenialH,nmouut In compar
ison with what the futuro will bring
In tho development of tho electrical
Industry. Not even tho Edlsons and
othir electrical geniuses of the coun
try attempt to predict tho enormous
heights to which oloctrlclty will go
fts resoursces are boundless and its
powers marvelous.
Last year a weok was set asldo
for the special attention of tho peo
plo In regard to electricity it was
named "Electrical and .Prosperity
Weok" and was ono of tho most
successful occasions obsorved by tho
entire nation. This year It is known
as "America's Electrical Week" and
from coast (o coast gaily colorod
posters, stickers, pamphlets, booklets
and other literature Is calling tho at
tention of the peoplo In evory town,
village hamle't and community to
electricity and its progress.
Logan is right up to tho mlnuto
In observing America's Electrical
Week and, the town Is "full circuited"
for tho occasion with splendid elec
trical wndow displays and scores of
other, timely features.
