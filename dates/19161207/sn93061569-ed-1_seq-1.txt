GECRGE FALLIS YAKS
OVER JACK COLLINS
THE BOY FROM OKLA. TAKES
TWO STRAIGHT FALLS FROM
THE NEBRASKA LAD. A RE
TURN MATCH MAY BE MADE
On Monday nijiit, at the Dixie -theatre,
in one of the moit evenly matched
wrestling bouts ever staged in this
section of the country George Fallía,
of Cherokee Oklahoma won in two
straight falls from Jack Collins who
hails from Hastings Nebraska. The
first fall .was made in thirty-one min
utes and the second in fifteen minutes.
The wrestlers came upon the mat at
. , , ,L . .
10 o'clock and after a few preliminary ,
remarks yarding the wrestling game ,
by referee Dr. Chilton, he introduced
the boys to the audience. Fallís at
the start assumed the aggressive and
kept Colllins on the defensive almost!
all through the exhibition. Only twice
did Collins assume the agressive and
thai lasted only a few minutes. Fal
lis was the more clever, but Collins
strength and endurance enabled him
to break many holds and he came out
of many difficult situations when it
seemed as though it would be impossi
ble. After thirty-one minutes of hard,
fast work. Fallis secured a toe hold
and forced Collins to yield.
The second fall while accomplished
in less timo was very fant. At one
time it lool:cd as though the Nebraska
ad would get the fall, but the speed of
Fallis enabled him to again come to
the top, and in a few minutes he se
cured a saddle hold and pinned his
opponent to the mat for the second
fall.
The audience, although small was
very enthusiastic and was on its feet
most of the time, cheering and encour
aging favorites. The fact that the
matches that have been pulled oft here
in the past have been flukes may have
been the reason for the lack of interest
If such men as those who participated
in the match Monday night, can be
brought here and the decisions ren
dered in the square, unbiased manner
as those of Dr. Chilton were it will act
as a stimulant and good crowds will
attend and the interest will be revived.
Mr. Fallis and Mr. Collins are both
gentlemanly turned fellows in every
respect and their exhibition was fair
and clean and entirely free from the
"rough stuff" that is so disgusting to
the fans and they made many friends
while here. If a return match is made
as is now on foot we predict that the
attendance will more than double that
f last Monday night.
The hoys who were ndvertised to
box a six round preliminary failed to
make an appearance and two other
boys, Charles Neil and Barton Simerel
volunteered to go on instead. They
put up a very good exhibition and
were cnthusiasticlly received by the
audience. A collection was made up
amounting to over four dollars which
was given them.
The promoter of the match was El
bert Pnvis and he was assisted by Mr.
Schwcstka and the manner in which
the match was conducted reflects with
credit on them and we hope they may
give more such exhibitions here this
winter and thaj the fans will show
Un : i ;i ' Nation by attending. We
undeislund that preparations are un
der way for another match about New

AS 1 JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE
(By Napoleon Hill)
I wish to be of service to my fellow
men as I journey through life, and I
wish to carry with me wherever I go,
a disposition of sunshine and good fel
Uwship To do this I have adopted
a ruido which I shall endeavor to fol
low in dealing with my fellow beings
af this guide I adopted in my boy
hood days, and a part of it I picked up
from observation as I grew into more
mature age and as I learned from per
gonal contact, with men and women
Uiat life is pretty much what we make
it that we largely control our own
destines and our progress on this earth
For the Benefit! of those who may wish
to emulate me in adopting so much of
my daily guide as may conveniently be
put into use by them in their own deal-
ingswith their fellowmen, 1 submit
odt of it as follows:
To train myself so that never under
any circumstances whatever, shall I
find fault with a single person, no
matter how much I may disagree with
him or how inferior his work may seem
to be, so Ions; as I know b is sincerely
trying to do his best -
To respect my country, my profess
ion, and myself. To be honest and
fair with my fellowmen, ais I expect
them to be honest and fair with me.
To be a loyal citizen of the United
States of America. To speak of it with
praise, and act always as & trust
worthy custodian of ita good name. To
be a man whose name carries weight
where ever he goes.
To base my expectations of reward
on a solid foundation of services ren-
. u" u- " " W"TB v"c
'of sucess in honest effortti To look
ZZZZZ
and not as a painful drudgery to be
reluctantly endured.
To remember that success lies with
in myself in my own brair., my own
ambition, my own courage and deter
mination" To expect difficulties and
and force my way through them. To
turn hard experiences into capital for
future struggles.
To believe in my proposition heart
and soul. To carry an air of optim
um in the presence of those I meet
To dispel ill-temper with cheerful
ws, kill doubts with a strong con
viction, and reduce active friction with
an agreeable personality
To make a study of my business,
To know my profession in every de
tail. To mix brains with my efforts
and use system and method in my
work. To find time to do every need
ful thing by never letting time find
me doing nothing. To hoard days
as a miser hoards dollars. To make
every hour bring me dividends,, in
creased knowledge or healthful re.
creation.
To keep my future unmortgaged by
debts To save as well as to earn. To
cut out expensive amusements until I
can afford them. To steer clear of
dissipation and guard my health of
body and peace of mind as a most
precious stock in trade.
To avoid procrastination in all of
its various forms, and never, under
any circumstances, to put off until to
morrow any duty which I should per
form today.
To endeavor to give something to
the world in return for the food and
raiment which the world gives me,
and to so live in the pursuit of my
daily occupation that I will make
those with whom I come in contact
happy.
To reap a rich harvest of happi
ness from' the thought that my aim
in life shall be to give happiness, help
and encouragement to those around
me, and to expect reward in a gener
ous proportion to the seeds I sow
which generate them
Finally, to take a good grip on the
joys of life. To play the game like
a man. To fight against nothing so
hard as my own weaknesses.
So I may be courteous to men,
faithful to friends, true to God a
fragrance in the path I tread. The

ber 27th. Captains in various dis
tricts have been named and all pre

ment and be on hand. .
Owing to the fact that guns are not
essentialand dogs not invited, you are
requested to leave these at home. This
,is taken as a precaution against acci
dents.
The extermination of the rabbit is
most essential for the welfare of the
farmers, because they destroy acres
of products during a year and the
people- of the county should take an
active interest in these drives.
Now altogether get behind the move
and make it a success.

PIONEER GARAGE MOVES
INTO NEW BUILDING
7 0
The Wikoffs have moved into their
new garage and we must say, af'.cr
making a completo tour of inspec
tion, that this is one of the finest ga
rages this side of Denver. It is the
most complete building of its kind in
the city of Clayton. A larjre, well-
lighted room has been prepared for a
rest room for ladies traveling ihrouuh
A large leather couch will be built
across one end of it by the Clayton
Construction Company; The wood
work is to be Flemish Oak finish.
There are private offices for both
Mr. Wikoff and Allen." The work
shop is well lighted and will bo equip
ped with everything in the., line of
tools.' The vulcanizing ahd engine
room has a concrete floor, concrete
sides and fire-proof roofing so there
will be no danger from fire. The large
basement holds the f irr.ace for this
garage is steam heated throughout,
A whole car of con' can be stored at
v:c- time in its capacious depths. A
fi:e septic tanx solve! the sewerage
problem, and altogether, there has
been nothing left to be desired in this
handsome structure. The Pioneer is
Liable to supply the increasing de
mand for Fords as the railroad com
pany has been short on cars in which
to ship them out. However, they are
getting them in as fast as possible and
sent out six new ones this week,
The new garage is a great addition
to the main street and will be a. big
advertisement for Clayton in the sum-
mer when the tourists begin to come
through here.
FARMER'S EQUITY
MEET AT BURNETT
A LARGE AUDIENCE GREETS
NATIONAL ORGANIZER, MOR
RIS. TURFS THOUSAND DOL
LARS SUBSCRIBED.
One of the most enthusiastic meet
ings ever held in the county was at
Burnett last Wednesday evening. J. "
A. McCune, W. II. Lindsey and H. G.
Morris went! out from Clayton. It wag
a matter of a very few minutes until
$3000 was subscribed in stock toward
the Equity organization.
James Chapin, President of the Bur
nett local, introduced W. H. Lindsey,
the county president, who made a
short and interesting appeal to the
local to stand by the work which ia
being done. He then introduced H. G.
Morris, National organizer of the
Farmers Equity, who made one of the
most interesting addresses we havo
listened to for some time. He is a pi
oneer fanner of Idaho and has seen
the Equity organization do some won
derful things in the way of marketing
produce and buying it.
He made the assertion that the
farmers were the cream of the earth.
That there was no skim milk about it
He said some of them however, hadn't
their imaginations trained up to the
Equity idea and v. hat it would do for
them.
Some of the things accomplished in
Idaho were cited as follows: The
handling through the county clearing
house in one .county alone, of 600 cars
of coal, 300 cars of lumber, 97 cars of
implements and machinery, 41 cars of
sacks at 8c each and 4 cars of binding
twine. There are 30 clearing houses
in as many counties there.
He pointed out the advantage of
buying in large quantities and of co
operation in selling. He quoted from
the farmers' Bible as follows: "What
docs it profit a man if he raiseth an.
abundance of the finest crops on earth
and getteth not the price therefor."
Mr. Morris should be on the vaude
ville stage instead of organizing farm
ers societies. We have never heard a
more clever rendition. of popular songs.
He plays as well as he sings. He waa
encored again and again, and in spite
of the fact that he had had a sever
headache, he good-naturedly respond
ed. The meeting lasted until after 12
o'clock and even then the crowd was"
reluctant to go.
Burnett is one of the "livest" com
munities in the county and boasts a
fine school house well equipped. They
have an excellent school, an excellent
teacher, Mrs. Dodson by name, thirty
five pupils and they are fencing the
yard, planting trees and will put down
a well in the near future. A box sup
per was given there last week for the
benefit of tho school fund and $107.65 .
was raised. We believe this is the
nrgest proceeds ever derived yet for
any fund by means of a box supper.
The families of C. M. Sanchez, Ful
gencio Baca and Miguel Tix'er at
tended from town. On Sunday, Dec.
17th Rev. Clouse will hold a temper
ance meeting and there will be an all
:lay session with dinner on the ground.
These folks believe in progressive-
VCF3 and lot no grass grow under their
fro:. L. H. Morrison is a delegate
from Burnett to the National Equity
meeting in Kansas City.
COW GIVES BIRTH TO TRIPLETS
There are triplets at the Palmer
ranch. Three fine, healthy, strong,
white faced calves and "mother and
children are doing well." If Bob
could buy a whole herd of cows like V
this one, he would have the most
sought after cows on the market It
is not an unusual thing to see twin
calves ocasionally but triplets well.
R. Q., we expect that cow knew how
the election went.
