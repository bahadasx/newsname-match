I Fate of Troops Left in Doubt Brief News
I Despatches Tell Little of Actual Conditions
I Wallachia Probably Abandoned.
Petrograd, Dec. 7, via London, 3:07 p. m. Bucharest,
the Rumanian capital, has been evacuated by the Rumanian
'j, troops, says the Russian official statement issued today and
; the Rumanian forces to the south of the capital also have re
tired. In Wallachia the Rumanians are retreating towards the
east under hostile pressure and holding the Teuton forces by
I rear guard actions.
p
U The brief dispatches in which the
? fall of Bucharest was announced left
) in doubt the fate of the armies which
; were resisting the advance of the
!j Teutonic invaders.
; It is assumed in most entente quar
'f ters, however, that there was no "last
stand" by the Rumanians before their
j capilal and such news as has trickled
through from German .sources indi
j cates that Bucharest was virtually de-
sorted when the Teutonic forces en
tercd it. The city is said to have been
J found uninjured
;; Main Troops Escape.
I Military commentators in entente
j capitals point to the probability that
the actions just prior to the capture
i of Bucharest were fought merely with
; a -view--to -delaying- the advance of"
Field Marshal von Mackcnsea's forces
1 and aiding in the escape of the main
I; body of Rumanians,

; Rumanians Abandon Wallachia.
; Gorman opinion is expressed to the
; effect that the Rumanians have de
t cided to abandon all of Wallachia, the
main portion of the Rumanian king
dom, and retire lo Moldavia, their
northeastern province where the front
would bo materially shortened and
where they would be in close touch
with the Russians.
The total captures of Rumanians by
the forces of the central powers since
, the beginning of the war are reported
', to have been 100,000 men.

RUSSIAN SHIP SUNK.

Shipping Agency announces the sink
ing of the Russian sailing vesseLAns.
STEAMER ARABIA
TRANSPORT SHIP
- .
Germany Contends British
Vessel Sunk in Mediter
ranean Was Auxiliary
Warship.
Washington, Dec. 7. Germany, in
a TintR madp nilhlif hv Vi ctotn rlo.
partment today, contends that the
British steamer Arabia, sunk in the
Mediterranean on November 6 was in
reality "a transport ship for troops in
the service of the British government
which is to be considered as an aux
iliary warship accordingto interna
tional and can therefore be treated
like a warship."
The German government's attitude,
however, like that in the Marina case,
is expressed to be one of readiness to
make amends if it be shown, that the
submarine commander violated Ger
many's pledges to the United States.
Note to Official Charge.
The note, addressed by the Berlin
foreign office to Charge Grew, in re
ply to his inquiries, made on Instruc
tions from Washington, follows:
"Foreign office, Berlin, December
4, 1916.
"The undersigned has the honor to
inform Mr. Grew, charge d'affaires of
the United States of America, in re
ply to the note of the 21st ultimo
that the investigation conducted by
the German government concerning
the sinking of the British steamer
Arabia has led to the following dis
patch: On the morning of November
6th a German submarine encountered
a large steamer coming from the Cor
ingo straits, one hundred nautical
miles west of the island of Coringo.
The steamer was painted black and
had a black superstructure and not,
as is otherwise the case with P. and
O. line superstructures, a light color.
The steamer, which was identical with
the Arabia, was not traveling on the
route regularly used by the passenger
steamers between Port Said and Mal
ta, as is made plain on the enclosed
map, but was taking a zig-zag course
toward the west 120 nautical miles
north of that route. This course, on
which the submarine passed three
similar steamers at the same spot on
the same morning, leads from the Ae
gean to Malta, so that the Arabia
was moving on the transport route
Coringo-Malla, used solely for war
purposes, according to the experience,
until now. The commander of the
submarine further ascertained that
there were large batches of Chinese
and other colored persons in their na
tional costumes on board the steam
er. He considered them to bo work
men soldiers such as are used In
great numbers behind the front by the
I enemies of Germany. In spite of the
clear weather and careful observa
tion he did not perceive any women
and children.
Believed Ship to Be Transport.
"In these circumstances, the com
mander of the submarine was con
vinced that in tho case of this steam
er he was concerned with a transport
for troops in the service of the Brit
ish government which Is to be con
sidered as an auxiliary warship, ac
coi'ding to international law and can,
therefore, bo treated like a warship.
He accordingly considered himself
justified in attacking the steamer
wlttiout delay and Bank it.
"Should the American government
give the official data showing that the
Arabia was at the time of the tor-
pedoing an ordinary passenger steam
er, tho action of the commander would
not have been in accordance with the
instructions given him, since these in
structions are now, as. before, in agree
ment with the assurances of the
German note of May, 1916. This
would then be a case of a regrettable
mistake from which the German gov
ernment would promptly draw the ap
propriate consequences."
What action the state department
will take is problematical. Secretary
-uansing refused utterly to comment
on the case tooay and other officials
were reticent.
Contention Must Be Proved.
Should it be shown that the Arabia
was, as Germany contends, a trans
port, this government probably would
admit the sinking was justified.
If, however, it is shown that the
submarine commander was mistaken
in Holding her to be a transport, a
most serious situation will confront
the state department. At the time
the Sussex was sunk, Germany was
told that this country could not tol
erate "regrettable mistakes."
German Acts Not Justified.
It may be said that tne United
States do not regard the circumstan
ces which the German note recites
as showing justification for sinking
the Arabia without warning, or as re
lieving the submarine commander
from determining the status of the
liner. The presence of Chinese on
board is considered of little import
ance but will be investigated.
It may be stated authoritatively
that no immediate action will be tak
en, as another step is regardeu as too
serious to be taken without complete
laclSi. It hinges -entirely on whether
the pledges given in tho Sussex case
were broken. The note published to
day is not regarded in official quar
ters as making a strong case for Ger
many. The note signed by the min
ister of foreign affairs, Zimmermann,
is the first received by the United
States since he assumed the post suc
ceeding Gottlieb von Jagow.

BRYAN UPHOLDS
STATES' RIGHTS
Opposes Centralization of
Power in Federal Govern
ment in Transportation
- Matters.
Washington, Dec. 7. William J.
Bryan appeared today before the joint
congressional committee investigating
transportation problems. He opposed
centralization of power in the federal
government in connection with rail
road suggestions for federal incorpor
ation and the proposal to lessen the
power of stale railroad commissions
by lodging greater power of regula
tion in the Interstate Commerce com
mission. Talks on Militarism.
"We cannot afford to shut our eyes
to the menace of militarism as it is
now presented. A large increase in
the number of army and navy offi
cers drawing salaries for life and
trained in a profession which teaches
reliance upon tho steel blade rather
than upon the sword of truth tends to
substitute false standards of honor
for .ne more peaceful standards that
prevail among the producers of
wealth.
"It is not unnatural that the mag
nifying of the profession of arms
should give support to the proposal
for universal military service, a sys
tom which is not only unnecessary,
but the adoption of which could not
fail to breed that military spirit which
has contributed so largely to the en
couragement of war In other lands."
To inform the voters of questions
under consideration at an election
A-i. Bryan proposed the publication
of a government bulletin with space
divided among political parties accord
ing to voting strength. He also sug
gested that newspapers, in return for
their mailing privileges, should be re
quired to give certain space for mat
ter the government desires published.
Electoral College.
"The election has shown us the
clumsiness of our electoral college
and the dangers which attend this
method of election," he continued,
"While the party electors are all
pledged to the same candidate, the
vote which they recoivo sometimes
varies a little according to the popu
larity or unpopularity of the elector
himself. Some plan should be de
vised by which tho voters can vote
direct for the president,
"Another reform for which It seems
to mo we are now ready is a change
in the constitution, making it more
easily amendable. It Is now neces

ROMANIAN FORCES
NOT DESTROYED
Never in Danger of Great Loss
Slightly Less Than Di
vision in Wallachia.
LOSS INCLUDES CIVILIANS
Faulty Organization of Equip
ment Railroads and Lack of
Heavy Guns Brought
Defeat.
London, Dec. 7. "The Rumanian
army Is still intact, as It was. never in
danger of great loss until it made the
stand on the Argechu where it was de
feated. It must have lost a consider
able number of men when the enemy
broke through," says a London mili
tary critic, General Maurice.
"In our presB there has evidently
been much misconception in regard to
the so-called Orsova army, left in the
rear of the Germans. As a matter of
fact there never was a Rumanian army
at Orsova. The only army in Wal
lachia was the First Rumanian army,
while slightly less than a division was
left at Orsova only as a rear guard.
This detachment was cut off.
Loss Includes Civilians.
"Reports from Germany of from 50,
000 to 100,000 Rumanian prisoners
must include the civilian population of
the occupied districts. The material
gain of the Germans around Bucharest
are not as great as they expected as
the Rumanians succeeded in inflicting
great damage on the ojl fields, while
much corn was removed,
"Some reasons for'the Rumanian dif
ficulties may be summarized as fol
lows :
"Faulty organization of equipment,
railroads and lack of heavy guns."
Referring to news nearer home,
General Maurice said:
"It is interesting to note that the
Germans when raiding London by air
always assert that they bombarded the
fortress of London. Therefore it Is
significant that the orders we cap
tured from occupants of an airplane
which dropped bombs here were mere
ly to bomb London without reference
to localities."
thirds of both houses and .ure
i fourths of tho states to secure an
amendment. That Is an unfair burden
to place upon the progressive ele
ment of the country. I venture to
suggest that the rule of the people
would be made more secure by a con
stitutional amendment permitting a
change in our organic law when a
majority of both houses in two suc
cessive congresses submit an amend
ment and that amendment is ratified
by a majority of the states, provided
tne amendment also receives a ma
jority of all the votes cast on that
proposition in all the states.
"Equal suffrage was the one ques
tion upon which all parties were
agreed in the last campaign, their dif
ferences relating only to the method
of securing the reform. We might as
well recognize the fact that a nation
al amendment will come when the re
form is adopted in a sufficient num
ber of state to make its adoption by
the nation probable. The Democratic
party, which builds upon the doctrine
of brotherhood, has more reason for
welcoming the co-operation of wom
en in the work that lies before the
party and it has especial reason for
regarding woman suffrage with fa
vor at this time since the Influence of
the women in the close states was suf
ficient to determine the result."
Mr. Bryan declared his opposition
was based on the belief that to trans
fer regulatory power to Washington
would impose an impossible burden
on the authorities here, injegt a tre
mendous political force Into national
affairs which would enter Into elec
tions to congress and would be almost
decided stop in centralization of gov
ernment. As a counter proposal Mr. Bryan
suggested existing law be amended
to give the national government full
power to regulate railroads and still
permit the states to exercise their
regulatory powers.
Speaking of government ownership,
Mr. Bryan said he "had for a number
of years believed it inevitable and
"only because the railroads will never
consent to effective regulation."
He spoke for federal supervision of
security Issues and believed thero
should be legislation to insure divi
dends sufficient to keep stocks at
par and provide a surplus fund for
lean years. Before Buch a measure
was passed, however, he said, cap
italization should bo reduced "to an
honest basis where it represents the
actual physical property." In some
financial operations, Mr. Bryan said,
tho railroads had been guilty of things
"discreditable to an ordinary highway
robber."

CHIEF WITNESS
IN BOFF TRIAL
Louis J. Smith and Six Others
Center of Interest in Bomb
Plots Case.
San Francisco, Calif., Dec. 7. The
government opened its fourth day of
prosecution against Francjs Bopp,
German consul-general of San Francis
co, and titled attache of his office, on
unneutral dynamiting conspiracy
charges by placing seemingly unim
portant witnesses on the stand appar
ently in careful construction of the
ground work of its case.
The government's chief witness is
Louis J. Smith, himself indicted as a
co-defendant in the alleged German
plots to stop shipments of war muni
tions to the entente allies early in the
TVar by dynamiting ships, railroads
and munition plants in this country.
Smith Copies Inscriptions.
So far the testimony of each gov
ernment witness has concerned itself
with Smith and his movements.
Charles Griffin, an employe of the
Hercules Powder plant at Pinole,
Calif., testified today that while he
and Smith were loading cases of dy
namite at the works in 1915 Smith
copied Russian inscriptions from
them.
"I want to find out what they
mean," Smith said, according to the
witness. Smith afterward was em
ployed by tho German consulate.
Telegrams Are Introduced.
After introduction of several tele
grams sont by Smith from Tacbma
and Seattle, Wash., to C. C. Crowley,
an indicted detective in the case, ap
parently to establish raith's presence
in the northwest in connection wtih
his alleged confessed attempt to place
bombs on munition ships to Russia,
the government shifted to another
phase of its case. Mrs. Louise Eck
hard, a janitress In a San Francisco
apartment house, was called.
She said Mrs. Margaret Cornell, a
detective employed by Crowley, lived'
in the apartment house and noted her
movements.
San Francisco, Dec. 7. Tho activi
ties of Louis J. Smith, one time con
fidential agent of the German consul
ate here, and now chief witness for
the government in the trial or Franz
Bopp. German consul general, and six
other defendants, charged with violat
ing the neutrality of tho United States
by conspiring to destroy munitions of
war destined for tho entente allies,
continued to be the center of Interest
at the resumption of the trial today.
Theodore Roche, on of counsel for
the defense, yesterday caused a stir
by acknowledging Smith's employ
ment by the consulate, but he said the
nature of Smith's duties was some
thing entirely different from that
charged by the government. Smith and
C. C. Crowley, one of the defendants,
were employed by tho consulate,
Roche said, to gather data and Infor
mation about the shipment of muni
tions of war as ground for protest
with the state department on viola
tion of American neutrality.
Complaints to the state department,
based on information obtained by
Smith and Crowley actually were for
warded through the German embassy
at Washington, according to Rocho.
The government prosecutors placed
witnesses on the stand today in an
effort to show Smith's concern for
American neutrality did not conform
to statements made by the defense. It
was not expected that Smith himself
would testify until early next week.
By that time the government ex
pects to prove that its star witness,
who is alleged to have disclosed the
nature of the bomb plots in Pacific
Northwest ports and in Canada, re
ceived pay for actually planting dyna
mite on a large of war munitions in
Seattle harbor in May, 1915, and de

belonging to the Alvarado Mining ic
Milling company. The refugees also
saw Theodore Hoemuller, once a Ger
man consul before they left Parral,
who was reported to have been ex
ecuted with his family. They said all
other Germans in the Parral district
were safe, except a number of Chinese
who were killed.
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 7. -Government
agents nore .today sent a report

London, Dec. 7, 3:35 a. m. The
London morning papers refrain from
predicting or even speaking on the
composition of Lloyd-George's cabinet, 'H
and there is nothing to indicate that
the suggestions made by the minority -H
have any special weight That Lloyd

The Times, which hails Lloyd

ship as "the only practical and
straightforward way to end the crisis," .
says: "The outcome cannot be fore- i
told. This, however, can be said, that
Lloyd-George has a far better chance iM
of forming a government than Bonar
Law. Whether he will succeed will 'H
depend largely on himself and his
often-tried power of rallying men of .'H
talent and enthusiasm to his side." i
Courage Is Needed.
The Chronicle, referring to the dlf- 1
Acuities facing the new premier, says: -
"Only a man of lion-hearted courage )
would face them. He has no organized
following in the house of commons, iH
and no party machine to help him, ;
whilst the situation of affairs whether
at home or abroad Is not by any means
cheerful. But the very boldness of the I
enterprise may win the sympathy of i
the British democracy, in which case '

There Is consensus of opinion among '
political correspondents that the prin- ,
cipal Unionist statesmen will be will- ,
ing to help the new prime minister,
but that he cannot expect any assist- ,
ance from his old Liberal colleagues,
who, according to the Times, are re- '
solved to support Asquith through

is much canvassed and Lloyd-George's
friends in the press say that reports
of labor's hostility are exaggerated.
Some go so far as to say that the po

adopt toward the new premier is as
yet unknown outside their, own caucus
