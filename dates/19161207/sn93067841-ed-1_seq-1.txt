< __ l _ t 1 i J i _t_ _ I i
many rnenas naa nopea wnen sne
was taken to A9heville, still the reports
were encouraging. Miss Ask
in9 will be remembered by her many
friends throughout the State as having
graduated from Greenville Female
College with the class of'13.
She was 23 years of age.
Miss Askins was one of this town's
most charming young women, of
whom it can truly be said that to know (
her was to love her. She was a consistent
member of theLake City Baptist
Church and an active worker.
She is survived by her parents.

Miss Emily Askins, and the following

read "15c per pound paid for cow (

made the price offered 25c per .
pound, and as a consequence Mr ]
Miller had many proffers of hides 1
and many explanations to make in 1
order to save himself the extra 10c i
per pound, even then he didn't al- J
ways succeed, but he is satisfied that 1
it pays to advertise in The County i
