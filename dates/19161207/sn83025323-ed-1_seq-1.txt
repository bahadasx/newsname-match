rate is fixed at. t per cent. In fixing
the interest rate the board was guid
ed by the initiative farm loan law,
but in fixing the amount to be loaned
was more liberal than the original
law, which provided that not more
than two-fifths of the assessed value
should be loaned. The board, in
stead of taking the assessed value,
takes the appraised value.
The rules are as follows:
"Loans will be made only to actu
al residents of Montana, and only up

appraised-not assessed-value of
not less than $10 an acre. No loans
will be made on more than two

a verified application, upon a form
furnished by the state board of land
commissioners. Such application
must contain an agreement to pay
railroad fare and traveling expenses
of the state land agent appointed to
make an apprisal of the lands offered
as security. No application will be
considered unless such agreement is
filed. Applicants must furnish at
their own expense an abstract of ti
tle to lands offered as security upon
request from the register of state
lands.
"All loans shall be secured by a
first mortgage upon lands offered
for security upon a form furnished
by the state board of land commis
sioners, running to the state of Mon
tana as mortgagee.
"All loans shall bear interest at 6
per cent per annum, payable andally
to the register of state lands, who
shall receive all monies, both princi
pal and interest, arising from such
loans, and accounts thereof to the
state treasurer.
$500 Is Minimumn.
"No loan shall be made of a sum
less than $500; and not more than
$5,000 wil be loaned to any person,
lirm or corporation. No loan will be
made for less than three nor more
than ten years. Payments may be
made upon the principal of any loan
running for more than three years
in whole, or in part by payments of
$100 or multiples thereof, upon any
interest bearing date, after three
years from the date of said loan.
"Before any loan is made the lands
lands offered as security bherefor
shall be examined and appraised by
the state land agent, whose appraisal
shall be based upon the productive
value of the land, exclusive of build
ings. The state land agent shall re
port his findings to the state board
of land commissioners upon forms
furnished by said board.
"All applications for loans shall as
nearly as practicable be considered
and acted uuon in the order of their
filing.
Certifcates of I)ischarge.
"Upon the full payment of princi
pal and interest and all other sums
becoming due upon any farm loan
mortgage, the register of state lands
shall execute a necessary certificate
discharge and release as required
by law.
"Whenever any farm loan mort
gage has been executed, the register
of state lands shall forthwith have
the same recorded in the records of
the county in which the land hypoth
ecated thereby is situated; he shall
also have cvstcdy and safely keep
a!: promisrv ncier, or other obliga
tions given by persces to whom mon
ey is loaned.
"The reg'ster .f state lands is
hereby authorized to purchase, or
have printed, any and all books and
forms necessary properly to record
the transactions involved in loaning
state funds upon farm mortgages,
and blank forms of mortgages, notes
applications for farm loans and ex
aminer's reports.
"These rules are subject to change
by the state land board at any time
without notice."
Thirty applications for loans have
been received by the state board of
land commissioners, and the appli
cants next week will be supplied
with the necessary blanks upon
which to make formal application.
A circular letter has been prepar
ed by Sidney Miller, register of state
lands, which is being sent to appli
cants, explaining the terms on which
moneys will be loaned.
Most of the loans are for sums
averaging about $2,000, but one
applicant applied for a loan of $30,
000. This will be denied, $5,000
being the maximum.
Rev. Thomas Sheehy went to Re
gina early this week, where on Mon
day he conducted the funeral ser
vices for Mr. Julius Poncelet, who
died last Thursday. The deceased
leaves a widow and five children to
mourn his loss. The large numbers
of sympathizers and friends who fil
led the church testified to the pop
ularty and esteem in which Mr. Pon
celet was held in and about Regina.
HIS LIFE'S JOURNEY'S OVER.
Frank Whitmore died at the Rob
etoyre hospital in this city Tue.sday
afternoon and arrangements have
been made for the shipping of the
body to the state of Washington
where it will be buried beside the
remains of his wife who died in the
western state a few years ago. De
ceased leaves two sons to mourn his
loss, one residing in Malta and
another in Washington.
Frank Whitmore was prehaps one
of the best known of the old time
freighters between Zortman and
Malta and was still in the freighting
business when overcome with the
sickness that caused his death. He
was beloved by all who knew him
and was a friend of everyone and
one of the best horsemen that ever
handled a freight outfit on the Lit
tle Rockies trail.
Mr. Whitmore started on his last
trip with a number of other freight
outfits last Tuesday morning, he
having a load of machinery for the
Ruby Gulch Mining company. It
was their intention to make School
House Coulee for Thanksgiving din
ner as they had a turkey with them
which they intended to cook at this
stopping place. Frank was taken
with an attack of pluerisy before
the camp wan reached, however, and
was hurried to Malta where all pos
sible medical aid was rendered him
but he succumbed as above record
ed.
With the passing of Frank Whit
more another old timer has crossed
the Great Divide from which none
return, but the memory of his good
deeds will live forever in the hearts
of his friends, both here and in the
mountains where a greater' part of
his life was spent.

We Need a County Agent
Subject Being Agitated In Phillips County---State Law Pro
vides for Employing County Agent---Would Be
of Great Benefit To Farmers.
There is more or less agitation at.
the present time in this county for I
the hiring of the county agent or ag
riculturist. Possibly c'.ome of our
readers do not know what. the
county agent is and what he does.
IHe is first of all a man who, Is
a graduate from some agricultural
school. He must also have experi
ence in practical work in the field
and be familiar with the agricul- 1
tural studies and research in Mon
tana aed the publications put out
by the :iperiment station. He knows
where to go for needed information
and is officially connected with its
source.
The county agent is an agent for
the farmers of the county in any
movements they wish to start such j
as gathering information from all
the farmers of the county and mak-.
ing it available for the use of each';
and every farmer; operating with
farmers to make field studies and
observations; assisting in securing
data upon the cost of producing thei
staple crops; endeavoring to im- i
prove the quality of crops by locat
ing the best seed and assist in pro- I
moting the use of better seed; im
proving the live-stock by means of
breeders' associations; organizing
cow-testing associations for the im
provements of dairy herds; promot i
ing social, educational and business
co-operations among farmers.
These are only a few of the duties
of the county agent. In a new coun
try like this where there is ,o much I
development yet to take place and
experimenting to do in ord:.r to find
the most productive and profitabie
crops such a man is infinitelv more
necessary than in the older settled
communities. Nevertheleuc. you
find these county agents all through
the eastern states and thw have
been a great help in those sections
in assisting in finding blttor meth
ods of farming and in iimproving
live stock and in ai thousand other
ways.

CRUSHED UNDER
HIS OWN WAGON
I Adrian Pepin Falls From
Load of Lumber and is
Killed by Wheels
1 "1 think we are now safely over
s the worst of our road," remarked
F Adrian Pepin, aged 22, to his com
panions Sunday morning at the
Whitcomb place 30 miles south of
Malta, a few minutes before his life
was crushed out under the wheels
of his wagon.
He was driving a team and in
compainy with two other rigs were
on their way from Malta to Regina,!
30 miles south, when in decending
la steep hill, the barrel on which he
wis sitting rolled over throwing him
tinder the horses heels and causing
them to run away. The wheels pas- 1
sed over his chest crushing his life
out instantly. The body was brought
to Malta by coroner R. V. Tucker t
mod is held at the Tucker under
taking parlors awaiting instructions
from relatives at St. Ametie, Quebec i
Pepin came to Regina about three
years ago and located on a home- I
stead. During the fall he has been 3
hauling grain to the elevators at
Malta with a four hourse outfit and
returning with lumber and coal. In
many places the road is very rough
and dangerous. The barrel ot
which he was sitting had been brac
ed in position with a sack of oats,
but the steep hill and rough road
throw it out of position.
PROHIBITION AND EQUALIZED

Only two out of the five proposi
tions voted for at the last election

Farm practice and experiences in
one locality do not always apply to
olher sections. There are differ
ences in soils, altitudes, climatic
ability to crops and tillage methods.
Farrm practice must be observed
and studiedwith references to these
local conditions to make it valuable.
Farmers may have neither time,
equipment, nor inclination for such
study by themselves. Besides is ex
pensive and unsatisfactory if under
taken individually. The county
agent could be a great help to farm
ers in exchanging information on
different problems that come up.
Community plans for improving
the quality of products better seed,
better breeding stock, etc., are more
effective than efforts of individual
operators in the same direction. A
county agent will be able to organ
ize growers and breeders so that
they may act as a unit to get better
seed and thoroughbred stock.

Mr. Hanscom is one of the popu

and his friends in Montana are num
bered by his acquaintances. He was
with the reclamation service for a
number of years and for the past
two or three years has been city en

SHERIDAN COUNTY TO BE
NEW JUDI('IAL DISTRI'CT
Word has been received from
reliable authority that Sheridan
county will in a short time, be de
clared a Judicial district in itself,
Valley and Phillip, counties to be
cut off and Judge Hurly, who wash
recently elected Judge of the Seven
teenth Judicial District, will have
his duties lessened by over one-half.
The people of Sheridan County
have long felt the need of this
change and doubtless the other two
counties will too, as there always
has been too much work for one
judge, in this district and frequently
judicial assistance has be-en w'llel
in from other districts.
Statistics show that 62 /2 per cent!
of the official business of the district
has been done in Sheridan County,
whereas, if a judge had been in con
stant sitting at the court house
many civil cases could have been
disposed with with much less liti
ident of Valley county.-Antelope
As soon ase Governor Samn V.
Stewart qualities at the first of the
year the change will take place and
a judge appointed for this district,
as judge elect John Hurly is a resi
Independent.

secretary and treasurer.
The project is being promoted by
William C. Conway of Glasgow. He
expects to organize several like com

Harry C. Pulliam, aged 25 years
who recently squatted on a home
stead on Sun Prairie, was arrested
by Sheriff Shaw on complaint of
County Attorney H. L. Wolfe, Jr.,
on request of Gov. Williams of Okla
homa, on the charge of receiving
money under false pretenses and a
charge of secreting property from
an attaching officer. Sheriff Long
of King Fisher Co., Okla., arrived
on Friday a. m. with extradition
paper issued by Gov. Stewart and
took Pulliam, to Oklahoma on No.,

SHERIDAN A JUDICIAL DISTRICT
Considerable interest is being
taken by the people in the division
of the Seventeenth Judicial District,
comprising Valley, Phillips and
Sheridan. counties, and making Sher
idan county a separate judicial dis
trict. The Medicine Lake Wave
says that from official records it is
shown that the district court busi
ness done in Sheridan county is
nearly twice that of the other two
counties together.
Should the change. be made, a
new judge would be appointed by
Governor Stewart at the meeting of
the state legislature the first of the
year.
