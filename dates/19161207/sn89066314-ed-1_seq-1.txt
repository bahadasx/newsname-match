HAMILTON CMS
"17 MISSOURI ELEVEH
Harrfsonville, Mo., Tackle,
Chosen Today From Six
' Eligible Men.
ALL RECEIVED VOTES
Selection of-Leader Is .Made
on Second Ballot; Eight
M Men Graduate. s
Paul Hamilton ot Harrisontille,
Mo, a junior in the College of Arts
and Scienajf, was elected today by tie
eighteen' M men on this year'a foot
ball squad to lead the 1917 Tigers.
The election to the captaincy came
on the second ballot, after each of the
six men eligible to the place had re
ceived votes on the first Pre-elec
tion, speculation as to the probable
leader for next year's eleven had been
varied, owing to the number ot-,xnen
who were considered candidates for
the position. The election of Hamil
ton came, as a tribute to his ,pepu
larity and his splendid work at cea
inr And tarkle dnrlne the nast season.
Hamilton this year played his se$
ona season as a nger ret,umr. oo
was use&t
center in
the early
games and
more than
upheld the
positio n
1 against all
comers. In
juries to
lineme n
caused his
removal to
tackle in
the tatter
gametfcof
tie season
and he con
tinued h i s
good work
at this -po
sition. His ability to charge the
Kansas line was a potent factor in
the Missouri victory Thanksgiving
Day, and, along with Rider and Stan
kowski, he received a major part of
the credit for the defeat of the Jay
hawkers. Weighing 171 pounds and
standing six feet tall, he used his
physique to the best possible advan
tage and is in line for a position -on
the all-Valley eleven.
Hamilton had played little or no
football when he entered the Univer
sity three years ago. Since that time
he has put Harrlsonville on the ath
letic map. His popularity with the
townspeople bf Harrlsonville is. shown
by the fact that a large body of them
came to the Kansas game carrying a
large banner bearing the inscription
"Paul Hamilton's Home TownyJHar-
risonville, Missouri." These loyal
friends later became so Incensed over
a newspaper account of the game
which seemed unfair to them that
'sixty of them promptly discontinued
their subscriptions. Hamilton is a
member of the Delta Tan Delta fra
ternity,
Of the eighteen Tigers who were

TODAY'S Ml LATE
Last December Thunder
Shower in 1909 Autumn
Unusual, Says Reeder.
v,The trst thunder-storm in Decem
beaalaii Deoemhfcr 5 190St,eached
Columbia 'today.
"The prevailing storm is In prog
ress south of tts," said George Reeder,
in charge ot the local weather bureau,
this morning. "Tomo"rrow Texas will
have a lower temperature than the
central Btates, but we will not have
much of this weather. Tomorrow
will be colder and fair. There is
nothing unusual in the presence of
the thunder-storm, although it Is a
little unusual to the outsider.
"We have had constant calls at the
office from farmers in this county
who. are waiting for 'hog-killing' time.
To them we will say now' that the
time is coming, and we predict fair
and colder weather for the rest of
the week.
"This has been an unusual fall,"
continued Mr. Reeder." November was
colder than last year, but there has
been a great amount of sunshine, and
up to the present Ume we have had
typical fall weather. One of the
phenomenal things of the present
month is the fact that the first six
days of the present month have been
eighteen degrees warmer than the
average of previous early days of De
cember. Never in the history of this
state has the temperature for the
early part of the month been so far
from normal."

Mr. Winternltx believes that the
possibilities for this play are good.
"Our aim," he said, "Is to see if the
University -will support this kind of
undertaking. If It docs, a dramaUc
club, which can easily present one
play a month, will be organized with
membership open to the student body.
It Is planned to have a new cast for
