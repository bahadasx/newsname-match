Six More States Gone Dry
The battle between the forces of the saloon and pro
hibition moves forward.
Six of the nine states that voted on the issue Nov. 7
placed themselves as opposed to the continuance of the
saloon in politics, in the social, in the industrial, and in
the commercial life. They are the following: Oregon,
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Idaho and South Dakota,
making the total number of dry states in the Union fifteen.
We do not lose heart; but take new courage. We
do not forget that a campaign is never won by one battle.
We must meet the enemy again and again until his re
sistance is broken.
Let us bear these things in mind in our own Com
monwealth's struggle for freedom. .
The Railroad Problem and the
Eight-hour Law
The railway situation in its unsettled state is a diffi
cult problem.
A number of railways have brought injunction suits
against the constitutionality of the Adamson eight-hour
law. One was tried in the Federal Court at Kansas City,
in which Judge Hook decided the law unconstitutional;
the case was appealed to the Supreme Court
The representatives of the employes are lined up with
the government attorneys in fighting the suits. The lead
ers of the railway brotherhoods appeared before the joint
congressional commission of investigation in Washington
and attended the Convention of the Federation of Labor
in Baltimore.
President Wilson may press upon Congress the ad
ditional railway legislation that Congress neglected to
enact last summer; which will increase freight rates and
make investigation of industrial disputes compulsory and
ever put an end to strikes. This the labor leaders oppose.
With these lineups and vacillating affiliations of fac
tions it seems the time of a final solution of the problem
is in the distant future.

GOD'S WILL
By Mildred Howells
God meant me to be hungry,
80 I should seek to find
Wisdom, and truth, and beauty.
To satisfy my mind.
Ood meant me to be lonely,
Lest I should wish to auy
In some green earthly Eden
Too long from heaven away.
God meant me to be weary,
That I should learn to rest
This feeble, aching body
Deep in the earth's dark breast

Rumors of a change In the Eng

a conference of the Prime Minister
with King George. It is 'known
that discontent exists over the slow
ness with which decisions are reach

that the Cabinet consists of twenty
three members, too larire a bodv for

The Socialist members of the Ger
man Reichstag are opposing the
compulsory system of labor which
the government has brought to bear
on the Belgians. They object on
the grounds that the method will
prove injurious to labor and tend
to make it less free and honorable.
The Reichstag as whole has en
dorsed the measure by a large ma
jority. England has decided to take over
the coal fields of Wales in anlici-!
pation of shortage in that article I
so necessary at the present time.'
Strikes among the miners in tho !

Troublous times have fallen on

Several hundred were killed in
streets and on the hills around Ath
