"GENTLEMAN JACK"
10
Intended Victim Shows Too Much
Fight and Jack DeMonte is Foiled
In Attempt To Relive John
Key of Hit Hard Earn
ed Cash.
John Key, a Morrow county farm
hand, was not 'the easy victim that
he might have appeared to "Gentle
man Jack" Xte Monte, Chicago Pete,
or what other name he may be known
by. Last night John went to bed in
the Palace hotel and left the door
open lor .his roommate, Bob Allatott,
and had not yet fallen asleep, when
the door opened and in stepped Jack
with a big revolver In his hand.
: According to young Key, De Monte
walked toward him, with the gun
pointed straight at him. Key Jump
ed from the bed, and as he did bo,
De Monte struck him a glancing blow
on the head with the gun. Key says
he grabbed the gun with one band
and his assailant's throat with the
other hand. They rolled over on the
floor, the blood streaming from the
wound In Key's head. All this time
Key was yelling loudly and his out
cries brought several lodgers to the
room. The boys were separated, the
deputy sheriff, Willard Herren was
called and DeMonte was taken up to
the county jail. Key washed the
blood from his face, bound up his
head and went back to bed.
John Key is an Industrious young
fellow and bad been working all sum
mer at the Robert Allstott ranch on
Eight Mile. Yesterday Mr. Allstott
brought Key to town, paid him his
wages and Key had Intended to leave
this morning tor his old home in Mis
souri. However, he will be detained
here until DeMonte has been given
a preliminary hearing.
DeMonte is little known here, oth
er than that he has been staying at
the Palace hotel, hanging around
pool halls, promoting wrestling
matches" and singing in the choir at
one ot the local Churches on Sunday.
Key had cashed his check yester
day and all his summer earnings
of more than $200 were under the
pillow of his bed. DeMonte and Key
had become acquainted some time be
fore. DeMonte's excuse is that he got
Into the wrong room through mis
take. A young fellow by the name Bran
non from Hardman complained to the
night clerk yesterday morning that
he had been relieved of four dollars
Tuesday night but no serious thought
was given to the matter. Now there
is some inclination to connect Bran
don's story up with the procedure of
last night.
