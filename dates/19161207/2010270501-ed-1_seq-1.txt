It was all ended until tney convincea
Sheriff Dyson 'of that place that they
were both of marriageable age. It
seems that the parents of the pros
pective bride had forbldaen ner to
marry the man of her choice and the
young people took the matter into
their own hands and purchased tic
kets for this city, where they propos
ed to be married. The wrathful par
ents of the orlde learned of their
sudden departure on Wednesday of
last week and called tho sheriff at
Bridgeport by long distance tele
phone, and Instructed him to hold
the girl because she was only 17
years of age and still under parental

cincts will elect directors for- three
years as provided by Article IV of
the Box Butte Farmers' Association
constitution. Meetings are arrang
ed to be held In every precinct In the
county.
To Review Season's Work
County Agent F. M. Seidell will be
present at all meetings ana will give
a review of the season's work, which
consists largely of -farm manage
ment, crop and live stock demonstra
tions, boys' and girls' club work,
community development, disease con
trol," marketing, etc.
Discuss l arra Lioan Act
At these meetings considerable
time will be taken to explain the fed
eral farrri loan act as it applies to
Box Butte county farmers, with the
object of organising loan associa
tions the following week. The pros
pect of long-time loans at low rates
of Interest has aroused much Inter
est in the federal farm loan act and
a large number of Queries for infor
mation as well as applications- ior
loans are being received at the Ag
ricultural Extension Service offices
at the University Farm, Lincoln. The
county agent has also received many
requests for Information. These
meetings will afford all an opportun
ity to learn all there is to know about
the proposition.
Much Interest Shown
A rate of interest not to exceed
six per cent and probably much low
er Is the outstanding advantage to
be gained by the borrower who
makes use of the loan association.
Inasmuch as-the average Nebraska
farmer now pays "7.1 per ctnt for the
money be borrows, this low rate of
interent will do much to make the
man heavily in debt sleep . easier,
According: to figures furnished by
the United States department of ag
riculture, districts In weotern Nebr
aska pay
soon as ten farmers In one locality
desire loans amounting to $20,000,
a local association wry be formed,
The meeting to be held next week by
County Agent Seidell are in a meas
ure for the purpose of explaining the
act and organizing National Loan
Associations where desired.

BOYS BEAT FATHERS
RAISING POTATOES
Certified Tlekla of Hoys in Potato
Club Averajre SO Per Cent bet
ter than County Average
While as a rule fathers hat to
admit that th boy of th family Is -
capable ot and does put It over th
old man In any line of endeavor, yet
several dad ar going to have to ad
mit that their boys, who ar mem .
bers of th Box Butt Boys' Potato
Club, Jiave done better In the potat
businee this year, everything con-'
sldered, than have the fathers. . Th
ten member of the Boys' rotate, "
Club who have planted, cultivated
and dug more than one-eighth acr
of potatoes have, according to Coun
ty Agent Seidell, aon excellent
work:. -'
The average acreage planted by
the boys was 1.42 acres. The actual
yield averages 102 bushels to th
acre. The cost of production aver
ages 18.98 cents per bushel after al
lowing one-fourth for the rent or in
land. The average profiteer acr .
was $86.81 after allowing for th .
rent and other expenses. Certified
yields averaged 121 bushels or about .
sixty per cent more than tha average
yield In the county.
When boys' ny careiui ana am
gent work, can produce a yield that
averaged up Is sixty per cent better
tian the average yield In the coun
ty, they ar certainly to be congrat
ulated. Th work of the boys Is ev
idence that by careful attention to
every detail the yield can be greatly
Increased. Farmers are aiso oegin
nlng to find out that with more car
the same ground and the same seed
can be mad to produce greater prof
it. The total value ot these club
members' crops figured at $1.25 a
bushel Is $1,811.88.
The boys found pleasure In their
work. They reaped a good crop and
made some money. In addition to
this the ten boys with the highest
rating will be given free courses ia
the Boys' Potato School to be held In
Alliance next spring. Boys from all
over th potato growing sections of ,
western Nebraska will be In attend--ance
at the school held here and will
learn lessons in potato culture that
win not -only be of benent in me t
club work tor next year, but will al
so be ot great value to them tnrougn
their entire tarming career. -
