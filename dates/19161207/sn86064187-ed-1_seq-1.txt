Unionist Support Is Assured;
Liberal Party Will Hold
Meeting Friday.
LONDON, Dec. 7. According
to the Central News, the labor par
ty hat decided to accept the invita

government
The party had been offered two
eats in the cabinet, one representa

undersecretaryshipa.
The house of commons adjourned
until Tuesday. A meeting of the
liberal party will be held Friday
over which Mr. Asquith will pre

lecided definitely that David Lloyd-
George will undertake the formation
of a ministry, political circles todav
were interested rhiedv in the nersonnrl
of the new cabinet and the prospects
of the new premier for getting together
a combination that will have the sup

of Mr. Astiuith's ralnnet are likely to
accept oilice miller Mr. I.lovd-Georee

Austin Chamberlain and Lord Rob

STEAMER ARABIA
TRANSPORT SHIP
Noto Declares Sinking by Div
er Justified.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-Germany,
in a note made public by the state de
partment today, contends that the Brit
ish steamer Arabia sunk in the Medi
terranean on November 6, was in real
ity a transport ship for troops in the
service of the British government,
whirh is to be considered as an auxili
ary warship, according to international
law and therefore can be treated like a
warship.
The German government's attitude,
however, like that in the Marina case
Is expressed to be one of readiness to
make amends if it be shown that the
submarine commander violated Ger
