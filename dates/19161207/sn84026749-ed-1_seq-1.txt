egation of Federal Employes'
Union He Favors Raise.

House Leaders Hold Con
ference on Cost of Living.

Members Show Disposition
to Afford Relief. .
Additional Indication were seen at
xno uapitoi tonay mat congress win
turn tin attention to the subject of In
creasing the salaries of underpaid em
ployes of thn Federal Government.
A delegation repreientlnir the Fed
era! Employes' Union called uporr
Congressman Claude Kltohln, the ma
jority leader, and held an encouraging
conference. Mr. Kitchln told the dele'
Ration, which waa headed by II. M. Mc
I.arln, president of the union, that he
favored better salaried for the Gov
ernment clerks, but there was con
siderable opposition In tho House to
a olvll pension list, unless It were de
vised along- a contributory plan.
Held LIvInK Cost Conference,
While the Government clerks con
ferred with the Democratic floor
leader. Informal conferences on the
high cost of living; Issue, an related
to Government salaries, were held by
members of the Appropriations Com
mittee and House leaders. Roth on
the Democratic and Republican side
there Is a growing disposition to pro
vide salary boosts, but the seal is
yet to bn decided upon.
"I wntloyii the Government pay
Ito nrploye"fhouKH money that they
ran lay aside something for old age,"
Mr. Kitchln told the McLarln delega
tion. "I believe that we should aeo
U this."
Nevertheless, suggested Mr. Kitch
ln, the employes should not seek such
a radical Increase that opposition will
be engendered. Mr. Kitchln pointed'
out that In many sections of the coun
try there In an Impression that Gov
errment clerka have "sort Jobs" and
tills feeling may have Influence on
certain Congressmen.
Considerably Uneouraged.
Tho clerks' delegation, however;
was considerably encouraged after
their conference with Mr. Kitchln and
other House leaders will be seen.
Meanwhile, members of the Appro
priations Committee are at work on
the legislative, executive, and Judicial
appropriation bill, which Is practic
ally certain to carry provision for a
horizontal Increase of 110 per month
for all clerks of the lower grades.
There Is now an excellent prospect
that tho. employes of the District and
those covered in other appropriation
bills will be advanced.
The committee from the Federal
Employes' Union comprised II. M. Mc
Iarln, Jere Connolly, Own P. Kellar,
John H. Hcach, Joseph II. Hurley, IS. J.
Newmyer, Florence Etherldge. and
Lillian Keathlay. All were pleased
with the Intimation given by Lend or
Kitchln that some sort of favorable
action may bo expected at this sea
slon. .

pay of 33 cents a day above the rec
ommendation of the navy wage board,
if arguments made by a commlttea
of the International Association of

The committee, which was com
nosed of AV. W. Keeler. chairman: N.
P. Allfas, business representative; H.
J. Martin, 13. C McGregor, and II. I
Rlnehart. submitted a protest against
tlm recommendations of the waire
board. They asked an increase of 04
centsvper day this year, instead of
tho navy board's recommendations of
o.nt. n iv.
The committee urged Assistant Sec
retary Itoosevelt to consider that the
wugo board had not taken Into ac
count certain wage data In nearby
communities. They pointed to the
wages paid In the Mldvale, Ed iy
tone, Bethlehem, and Baldwin mu
nitions plants as showing that the
nrorosed 33 cents Increase was not
sufficient. The committee was confi

Classing some railroads of the post

Federal control of railroads would
bring Into national politics "a cor

Bryan opposed Federal control be

He came out flatty for Government

Re-equipped at Chihuahua City.
'EL PASO, Tex., Dec. 7. After re
equipping bla army with supplies
taken from Chihuahua City, Villa is
moving again, according to reporta
made to United States authorities here
today.
It Is believed the bandit chief Is
making his own headquarters at Ran
Andres, from which point he Is scat
tering his forces In small bands and
directing their operations.
In the past three days a rear guard
action between Vllllstas and govern
ment troops took place south of
Fresno, eight miles southwest of Chi
huahua City. The movements of gov
ernment troops are hampered by lack
of railway equipment, as Villa took
with him practically every available
piece of rolling stock. He also drovo
many automobiles away for the use of
ms oniccrs.
Unofficial reporta coming to mining
companies here state that the city -if
Durango was evacuated December 1!
by General Oavlra before an attack of
bandits and discontented members of
the Carranslsta garrison.
Confirmation of these reports could
not be obtained through official chan
nels. A Mexican Central freight train wus
held up and looted yesterday by ban
dits, presumably under Quevdo, at
Gallego. midway between the border
and Chihuahua City. Three carloads
of foodstuffs were captured.

Instructed further to confer with

According to one prominent labor

It is nelleved that the Welsh states
man will carry out to an even greater

six members, reducing the others to
mere heads of departments, not mem

ARABIA SUNK AS AN
ENEMY TRANSPORT
Germany So Explains Torpedo
ing of American Ship Willing
to "Draw Consequences."
Germany set up the contention that
the steamer Arabia was a troop trans
port, and admitted she. had sunk It
under that Impression In her answer
to American Inquiries made public to
day by the State Department. At
the same time Germany agreed to
"promptly draw the appropriate con
sequences," If the United States show
ed the vessel was an ordinary pas
senger liner rather than a transport.
Text of 3teaasge.
The text of the message said thn
following results were shown by tlm
German investigation:
"On the morning of November 0 the
aerman submarine encountered a
large steamer coming from the Cerlgo
straits, 100 nautical miles west of the
Island of Cerlgo.
,'The steamer was painted black
and had black superstructure and not,
aa Is otherwise the case with the
1. & O. line superstructure, In light
color.
"The steamer which was Identical
with tho Arabia was not traveling
on thn route regularly used by thn
passenger steamers between Port Said
and Malta, as Is made plain on tho
enclosed map, but was takln a ilg
sag course toward the west, IL'O nau
tical miles north of that route; this
course on which thn submurlne had
pavsrd three similar steamers, at tho
same spot on the same morning, leads
from the Aegean lo Malta, so that
the Arabia was moving on the Parlgo
Malta transport route used solely for
war purposes, according to the ex
periences until now.
Chinese On Board.
"The commander of the submarlno
further ascertained that there were
targe numbers of Chinese and other
colored persona In their national cos
tume on board the steamer; he con
sldered them to bo workmen soldiers,
such as are used In great numbers
behind the front by the enemies cf
Germany. In spite of the cleat
weather and careful observation, the
commander did not perceive any wom
en and children.
"In these circumstances the com
mander of the submarine was con
vinced that In the case of this steam
er he waa concerned wiui a transport
ship for troops In the service of the
Ilrltlsh government, which had to be
considered as an auxiliary war ship,
according to International taw, and
therefore being treated like a war-
"lie accordingly considered himself
Justified In attacking the steamer
without delay, and sank It.
AVould Htnnd Ileaponslble.
"Should the American Government
give the official data showing that
the Arabia was at the time of the tor
pedoing an ordinary passenger steam
i-r, the action of the commander
would not have been In accordance
with tho Instructions given him, since
these institutions are now, as before.
In agreement with the assurances of
the German note of May 101(1.
"This would then be a caso of a
roDTPltnhlH mistake from which thr
German government would promptly
draw the appropriate consequences.''

Abandon Homes In Flight.

GENERAL VON FALKENHAYN'H
HEADQUARTERS IN ROUMANIA,
Dec. -I (via wireless to the United
Press.) Every hundred yards thero
Is something dead or dying In Rou
mania. The country Is mad wltti ter
ror. Anarchy and chaos reign every
where, and the misery of the inhabi
tants Is terrible.
It Is to bring order out of this
chaos that General von Tulff, former
military administrator of Poland, be
fore Warsaw's fall, has been named
German governor general of Rou
mania. He Is now en route here with
two generals and an entire staff.

Roads Jummed by Itefugees,
The Roumanians, ordered from their
homes by their government, clogged
the roads, most of them with a few
belongings packed on small oxen
carts. The advancing Germans over
took these refugees. Then they turn
ed back toward their homes, only to
find In thdusandsof Instances that
everything they had left behind had
been plundered by other Roumanians.
As we rode through Ramintcu and
Walkla the wildest anaichy prevail
ed. The streets were Uttered wltb,
household goods, papers, window cur
tains, dead horses, und dogs. Mean
while bands of Roumanian gypsies
went from house to houso and shop
to shop, smashing windows and again
plundering the homes already half
destroyed. These plundering bunds
men, women nnd children piled what
they could not curry on their own
baclta on stolen horses or cows.
As I breakfusted with one family,
a bpy came In with a gold necklace
which he had picked from u Jewelry
store, new rubber boots and stock
ings, which he had stolen from an-(.-tin
r shop.
