- Thanksgiving 3 now among
the things of the past and many
- of us enjoyed a feast on the day,
but I opine very few in this com
munity regaled themselves on the
gobbler. For some reason very
- few raised turkeys during this
year, and the few, if any, climb
ed to such a perch as to be pro
hibitive as an article of food.

the call for an enlarged and beau

Life is the Cord of a
Rosary.
There was an old lady of Perth
Who was born on the day of her birth,
Who was married, they say,
On her own wedding day,
And died on her last day on earth."
And this lyrical limerick sums
up about all there is to may un
eventful and apparently placid
lives. To most of us, life is just
a succession of small affairs. We
are born we live we die. We
are children, adults, aged per
sons, and are no more. We wake
and sleep, joy and sorrow, work
and rest, play our little parts ;
and pass off the stage of action.
And soon the big, busy world for
gets all about us forgets that we
ever lived; and oblivion receives
us, and envelopes us forever.
Not one person out of a thou
sand ever is known beyond tbe
confines of his own state; not one
person out of a hundred thousand
is ever known beyond the borders
of his own country ; not one per
son out of a million is ever known
the world over.
Most of us lead obscure and un
eventful lives, as the world reck"
ons; and pass to our final rest and
reward almost unnoticed.
Life is the cord of a rosary.
Upon this cord are , strung the
passing days. We tell them over
as the devotee tells his beads
and utter a prayer or voice ,
hops, with each. And, at last,
we reach the last bead and the
crucifix: and the rosary drops
from our. nerveless fingers and
our task is done.
But placid lives, uneventful
lives may be useful lives. No
person, who really strives to do
good, lives in vain; he passes
something on to the future; he
adds something to the sum total
of human achievements.
So let's be comforted, encour
agedand live our little lives as
nobly as we can.
Breakfast and the beauties of a day

Man and Art.
Man is the last animal to ap
pear on earth, so, therefore, man
is the infant of the great scheme
of things. The war in Europe is
really the acts of infants and
they should be spanked and put
to bed.
The insect has it all over us be
cause it is a finished animal. It
inherits all of the knowledge of
the insects before it, The only
thing that man inherits is an ap
petite. The spider is a finished engin
eer without going to a technical
school, and man has to go to
school to learn all that the insect
has handed to it.
The time v, ill come when man
will be more progressive. The
first man appeared about 200,000
years ago and commenced to in
vent a language. That was the
birth of literature.
When the cave mother crooned
to her infant, that was the birth
of music, and when the first cave
man made a bowl and made it a
beautiful shape, that was the
birth of art. Art has a relation
to everything on earth. When a
piece of machinery runs smooth
ly and beautifully it is in reality
a work of art.
Art is a very necessary part of
our being. Art has been lost
from time to time in our history.
It is practically lost in this coun
try at the present time.
It isn't the high cost of living
that is causing all of the commo
tion. It is the high cost of stu
pidity. We are wasting money
every day in trying to make
things artistic, when if half the
money were used with more in-
telligence in the arts, money
would be saved.
Most Ameiican cities are spoil
ed hecause they were not laid out
in an artistic way. Art is a most
important part of city-planning
and eyery-day life. 3eorge W.

CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE BEGINS
RAILWAY INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bst
, tcr Cciiicri cl Carriers.
MAY CHANGE PP.ESENT SYSTEM
O'heialp of Prepared to Advocat
Kecicral rtorpora'ion, Supervision of
Socuritios and Extension of Authority
of Interstate Commerce Commission.
Washington. Nov. L'U Tvu members
f Congress, five Senators and five
incmin'i's of the House of Itepresenta
;lves, licxaii here to lay an inquiry into
tlie subject of public control and su
pervision of railroads that may lead to
the revolutionizing of the whole scheme
of poveninicvtal regulation of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee is to look Into the ques
tion of government ownership of rail
ways, telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies.
The members of the committee
which will conduct this Important In
vestigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman: Senators Robinson
of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Brandegee of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee,
Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin
and Hamilton of Michigan. The In
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson In his message to Congress In
December of last year. He described
as Its purpose to determine what could
be done "for bettering the conditions
under which the .railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all
interests affected .by the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
has Invited prominent shippers, bank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The first to be heard are railroad
commissioners of various states who
'begarfi their" evidence today. Their
testimony is directed ehjefly to oppos-Jeg-ary
. enlargement of the federal
authority ; over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the Increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the hearings cen
ters in the proposals that will be put
forward by representatives of the rail
roads, for it is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federal au
ihority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on record in favor of fed
eral ineororation of all railroad lines
Legislative Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative source Is ob
tained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider In
its investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects In the pres
ent system of railroad regulation is
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by the federal government and
by the 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed in the hands of a federal
body so that interstate tratlic may be
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan, a compulsory system of federal
incorporation is to lie recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issues.
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked,
in order to enable the commission prop
orly to exercise its increased powers.
!t Is also proposed that the preparation
md prosecution of cases against the
allroads shall be delegated to some
ther agency of the government, possl
')ly the Department of Justice, so that
he commission may devote its ener
rles to its administrative functions.
With the commission thus relieved
f some of its present duties and equip
ped to handle Its business more prompt
!y. the railroads will urge that 'the pe
rlod during which the commission may
now susind proposed Increases In
;ates be reduced from ten months to
10 days, with provision for reparation
o be paid to the shippers if the ad
.ance shall be declared unreasonable.
Thev will also ask that the commis
don be given the power to prescribe
minimum as well as maximum rates
so that in meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which It consW
ers too low.
One of the most important reeom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favorable consideration L;
that the commission be specifically
authorized to take into account In
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings in tbe light of ex
penses. While the Newlands Committee 4s
required, under the resolution creat
ing it. to submit a re'port by January
2 next. It is not anticipated that tbe
Committee will have come anywhere
near completing; its labors then;
NEW POLICY HEEDED
IN GOVERNMENT
RAILWAY CONTROL
Helpfulness and Encouraprasnt
Urged by Allied P. Thorn.
CREDIT KUST EE IMPROVED
Increase of Transportation Facilities
Nesotsar to Cocure Relief From
High Co.. of Living May Thus Be
Provided For by the Railroads.
Washington. Nov. US. A new policy
of government railroad regulation,
based on constructive principles of
helpfuliir .- unil encouragement instead
of upon . i'in . iplcs of regression and
punishment, was I'iged by Alfred I.
Thom, counsel for the Railway Execu
tives' Advis'-ry ( 'orrruKloe, the first
witness on behalf of il.e railroads be
fore the XewlanJs Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce, which has insti
tuted a genenil Inquiry into the prob
lems of ruiiroad regulation.
"It U proposed by the joint resolu
tion of Cciigiess," sr.id Mr. Thom, "to
gu into a comprehensive study of the
whole subject of transportation to
make a i:ew assessment, after years
of experiment, of its history, its pres
ent conditions and its future needs.
The railroads accept the view that reg
ulation is a permanent and enduring
part of government in America and
that the first duty of the carriers is to
the public. That duty Is to afford
reasonable facilities on reasonable
terms and ut reasonable rates, and this
must be done before any private Inter
ests can be considered."
Certainty, Safety and Sufficiency.
Mr. Thorn contended that the real In
terest of the public Is In being assured
of certainty, safety and sufficiency of
transportation facilities. Tather than in
rates. The first consideration of the
public is to obtain transportation facili
ties. What the cost is, is in reality a
second consideration, he said.
Mr. Thom proposed an Increase of
transportation facilities as a method
of securing relief from the high cost
of living. "There have been less than
1,000 miles of new railroad construct
ed in the Tnlted States during the past -year,"
he said.- "leas JUan In any year
since 1848, except the period of the
Civil War, and yet the cost of living is
dally advancing owing to a shortage of
supplies which might be remedied by
securing access to new areas of pro
duction. Credit Must Be Improved.
"This leads to the consideration as to
whether railroad credit is as good as
the public interest requires. It is im
possible for railroads to earn enough
to supply the necessary new facilities
from current revenue. They must be
provided from credit. Investors can
not be coerced, but must be attracted."
Among the conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter investors he
mentioned the following:
"First, Railroad revenues are not
controlled by Investors, but are fixed
am! limited by governmental authority
and not by one but by several govern
mental authorities, which do not recog
nize responsibility for assured results
to investors and are uncoordinated.
"Second, Railroads cannot control
and the government cannot und does
not limit the expense account.
"Third, The present system of regu
lation is based on a policy of regulation
and correction and not on a iolicy of
helpfulness and encouragement.
"Fourth. The outstanding obligations
of the railroads have already exceeded
the financial rule of safety and involve
a disproportionate amount of obliga
tions bearing fixed charges.
"Fifth. The investor must accept a
subordinate obligation or security with
no assurance of a surplus of earnings
to support it.
"Sixth, Other pompi titive lines of in
vestment present superior attractions.
"Seventh. The railroad business Is
largely controlled by jolitical Instead
of business considerations.
Look Forward, Not Back.
"We may debate about what has
caused the present conditions." said
Mr. Thom, "but we cannot debate about
what the people need. The President
has taken the view that we must look
forward in this matter and 'make a
fresh assessment of circumstances' in
order to deal helpfully and intelligent
ly with the problem. Abuses are
no more prevalent in the railroad busi
ness today than in any other business
humanely conducted. The great ques
tion now is whether the existing sys
tem of regulation gives the public re
liable assurance of sufficient present
and future railroad facilities.
"Those who oppose any change must
make their appeal on the ground that
the present systems assure the public
f the continued adequacy of trans
portation facilities. If they do not. no
argument based on the desirability of
the present dual system of regulation
will be accepted by public judgment
The question of 'states' rights' Is not
Involved. If the regulation of transpor
tation facilities privately owned should
fail government ownership must fol
low, and then all power of tbe states
over the railroads would disappear.
! "Let us debate this question, then,
uot upon any mere theory or jealousy
as to the distribution of governmental
power, but upon the large issue of
yhat tbe public interest requires in
respect of the assurance of ndequat
transportation service."
