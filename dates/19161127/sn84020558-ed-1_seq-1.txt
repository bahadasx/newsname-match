A coroner's Jury will probe Into the
past history of- Joe Gonzales in Justice
De Souza's court at 3 o'clock this af
ternoon In an effort to unearth some
ause. other than that given early Sun
day morning, for the killing of Treofilo
Flores.
According to the four Mexicans who
witnesse'd the shooting'. Gonzales acted
in self defense, as Flores had been the
aggressor throughout the argument
and the trouble that preceded his
death. 1 ifficers, who have delved into
the matter, believe that there Is a deep
seated mystery that prompted (5onzales
to resort to gun play.
From information gathered by. police
officials Sunday. Gonzales is a man
with a bad record. He is alleged to
have had two notches in his revolver
previous to the one he cut early Sun
day morning. His former murders. It
is stated, took place in old Mexico and
as a result, he escaped Kinishment.
Since coming to Phoenix, however,
Gonzales is said to have had a record
without a blemish before the shooting
affray Sunday morning. He has been
the proprietor of a billiard hall at fio3
South Seventh avenue, where the
shooting took place, for the past sev
eral months. He has never been in
trouble here, so far as police have bcrn
able to find.
(in the other hand, Flores is said to
have been in considerable trouble here,
although he was never implicated in
any very serious crime. His greatest
failing seems to have been his desire to
associate with John Parleycorn. In
fact, 11 was stated that he was under
the Influence of liquor when he en
tered Gonzales' place of business Sun
day morning.
According to information secured
Sunday, however. Gonzale-s and Flores
had spent the enrlv part of the even
ing together Only a short time before
the murder, the men are said to have
visited a restaurant in the Mexican
quarter, where they partook of a bowl
of noodles. At that lime, II Is stated,
they discussed the theft of several
electric light globes from Gonzales'
billiard hall. The men appeared friend
ly toward each other on leaving the
restaurant.
From the restaurant, they are said
to have walked to Flores' home on

IE BILLION
FROM INTERNAL'
REVENUE TUX
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26. More than
a half billion dollars was turned into
the federal treasury during the last
fiscal year by the internal revenue
bureau. Commissioner Osborn's an
nual report, made public tonight,
shows that receipts broke all records
with a total of $512,723,2SX, or t!f",00u,
000 more than last year.
Corporations paid $56,972,721 and in
dividuals $7,43,:95 on account of the
income tax, an increase of almost $1S,
000,000 for corporations and $37,000,000
for individuals. There was an enor
mous increase in collections from man
ufacturers of cigarettes. Production
of distilled liquors increased and al
though the output of fermented liq
uors fell off during the early part of the
year, a -steady increase followed.
"Hootlegging," or illegal sale of
liquor, the report says, continues un
abated and will continue until there is
a more hearty cooeration of local
officers in the various states. Evaded
taxes discovered approximate $."0.00o-
oao. Of this amount more than $62,000 -
000 was assessed as unpaid taxes, about
half being corporation taxes.
Commissioner Osborn recommends
that the personal income tax law lie
amended so as to require returns of
annual gross income of $3,000 or over
instead of annual incomes of like
amount and "information at the
source" be substituted for the present
system of withholding the normal tax
at the source of the income, except as
to non-resident aliens or corporations.
