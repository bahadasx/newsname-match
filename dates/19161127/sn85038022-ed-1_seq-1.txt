Let Us Be Thankful
For Peace, For Wonderful Crops, For Sunshiny Wea
ther, and For Our Good Friends.
UOUSEWIVES, the burden
of Thanksgiving fails on
your good shoulders, and
your work is greatly light
ened if your kitchen is prop
erly fortified with proper
kitchen utensils. We have
Butcher Knives, Carving Sets, Food Choppers, Ice
Cream Freezers, Double Boilers, Percolaters, and, in
fact, most anything that would help lighten your la
bors, and give you a cordial invitation to come in.
One lady said today, "I didn't know a hardware store
could be made to look so nice." IT IS NICE, and we
are proud of it, and want you to share our glory.
Wishing you a happy Thanksgiving,
MIKE BROWN
"The Square Deal Man"
Maygvl lie's flrat Tobacco Pair and
Corn Show has passed into history,
leaving hundreds of poople In the city
and county greatly pleased with the
three days festivities The total num
ber of paid admissions for the three
days will run considerably over 6,000
and then add those who had compli
mentary tickets the number will reach
the 7,500 attendance mark.
From the moment of the opening of
the fair, Thursday noon, until Its close
near midnight no one that had seen
the Liberty In all of its glory ever said
anything that would hinder others
from coming. They told each other
how good It was and what a great suc
cess It was. Undoubtedly it waa one
ot the greatest things ever pulled off
In this city.
A great deal of the credit for the
success of the fair is due to Superin
tendent T. P. Boone. Mr. Boone seem
ed to be everywhere at once and had
every detail completely mastered. His
assistants, Mr. A. M. January and Mr.
T. E. Foley also worked untiringly for
the success of the fair and their ef
forts were crowned with success.
Perhaps one of the things that mda
the fair such a splendid success wan
the way in which the merchants of the
city took hold of the booths and deco
rated them. Every booth In the build
ing, 46 in number, were taken and a'l
were decorated to the best possible ad
vantage. A stranger coming Inside
the building could tell as soon as h
had made the rounds of the booths Just
what the main business of the city
was, for there was a representation of
almost every industry in the corpora
tion. Every booth In the building was
worthy of a prize. A great deal of
time was spent by the Judges when
making the awards and the results
seemed to met the approval of all
persons present. The Maysvllle Cot
ton Mills and the State National Bank
won first and second prirs respective
ly for the best booth display and
Barkley'a Shoe Store and Oeisel and
Conrad won the first and st. ....1 prizes
respectively for the best decorated
booths.
The Germantown Band was present
the last two days of the fair and de
lighted the Utrgt crowds with ttu-ir
repertoire of selections. The playing
of the Maysvllle Bluegrass Concert
Band also received much attention.
The attractions, Lucaty and Costello
and Suvvoy's acrobatic Bulldogs,
greatly pleased the onlookers. The
latter show was the main attraction of
the fair and always a large crowd
watched the wonderful performance of
the animals.
That the fair is a permanent institu
tion in this city is now assured after
the way persons have requested its
continuance. The way the Mayaville
people have supported the fair this
year shows that they will be doubly
Interested next year and will give even
gt eater support. What knockers are
left are those that did not see the in
side of the Liberty Warehouse. Had
they done so, all knocking would have
forever beeu dispelled.
Although the prizes were awarded
on Friday in every department except
the tobacco the winners were not of
ficially announced until Saturday af
ternoon. The ribbons were placed as
soon as possible. The following Is the
list of prize winners:
