Auto Breakdown Causes
of Bride's Tears and
Not t'usband's Perfidy
Just because a pesky automobile
broke down and Because he was a wee
bit shy about telling an old-time friend
of his marriage, Edgar G. Cooper, aged
20, 116 Chestnut street, had no end
of trouble over the week-end.
Mr. Cooper, with Miss Mary Alice
Reese, a telephone operator from
Wilkes-Barre, slipped off to Hagers
town to be married on Thursday.
They were refused a license there, j
then went to Frederick, Md., obtained
a license and were happily wed. They
then returned to Hagerstown and the
excitement started. That is, the ex- -
cltement for the bridegroom.
Mr. Cooper decided that he needed
a shave, so Mrs. Cooper gave him the
family pocketbook—of course! At
noon "hubby" hadn't returned and
when late in the evening he didn't
show up "wifey" decided he had de
serted her, so she left for her home
in Wllkes-Barre.
"Hubby" really hadn't deserted her,
however—not that you could notice it.
Meeting an old friend in Hagerstown.
he accepted an invitation to take a
little trip to his friend's farm. He
was too bashful to say anything about
the wedding, so he went along. Then
the automobile broke down, and
"hubby" couldn't get back. When lie
finally returned to Hagerstown he
found that "wifey" had left for home,
so he started for Wllkes-Barre yester
day, where he explained and was for
given.

Washington, D. C.. Nov. 2 7.-—The
joint congressional committee investi
gating transportation problems re
sumed its sessions to-day with Albert
P. Thorn, counsel for the railway ex
ecutives advisory committee, again a

testimony and was readv to be cross
examined. This was the fourth day
of Mr. Thorn's appearance before the

detailed account of the difficulties of
the railroads in matters of finance and
in providing adequate facilities. His
examination was expected to occupy
most of the day.
GERARD SEES LANSING
Washington, D. G\. Nov. 2 7.—Am
bassador Gerard had a final confer
ence with Secretary Lansing to-day
preparatory to sailing for Germany
on December 3 byway of Copenhagen.
The ambassador and the secretary
were uniformly silent about what was
discussed at their conference, which
lasted an hour, but in official quarters
the impression prevailed that the deli
cate nature of the submarine situation
and the deportation of Belgians to
Germany were discussed. Mr. Gerard
probably will see President Wilson to
morrow.

CONFER ON FIRE
HOUSE QUESTION
WITH PARK BOARD
City Councilmen Invite Capitol
Extension Commission to
Discuss Problem
What arrangements the city will be
j expected to make relative to the vaca
j tion of the Mt. Vernon Hook and Lad
] der Truck and the Citizens' Fire Com
i pany houses incident to the taking
| over of these properties by the Capitol
{ Park extension commission will be
I discussed, it is understood, at the con
ference to-morrow between the Capi
| tol Park Commission and the City
| Councilmen.
| At last week's session of the city
| commission, a formal invitation was
j extended the State Board to meet
j with Council to-morrow to discuss the
I tax exoneration problem and it is be
lieved that the firehouse phase will be
I threshed out, too, at this time.
Both the Mt. Vernon and the Citi
! Zens' company houses are on Fourth
j street in the district that will neces
! sarily have to bo vacated to make way
! for the park extension. Harrisburg
I must meet the emergency that will
i confront the city before Spring at the
! latest.
| The tax exoneration question is an
| equally important question. At least
1 a dozen properties upon which the ex
tension commission have asked ex
| emption for 1914 city taxes were ac
; quired by the State prior to the levy
! ing of the assessment. The city com
missioners, however, contend that
| even though title has been taken by
j the State, there are several properties
whose owners still retain a leasehold.
This, city councilmen say, gives the
citizens the use of the houses without
subjecting them to taxation.
Amundsen Here to Buy
Hydroaeroplanes For Use
in Next Polar Expedition
New York. Nov. 27. Roalnd
! Amundsen, South Polar explorer, is
j here to buy two hydroaeroplanes for
use in his 1918 expedition into North
I Polar regions, he said on his arrival
at this port to-day on the Danish
'steamer Frederik VIII from Copen
hagen. The flying machines, he said,
! "would be constructed so as to travel
over smooth Ice as well as on water
and will be used for interior explora
j tions starting from the ship which
j will carry the party. The vessel will
be constructed, he said, so that the
planes can rise from and land on Its
decks. The explorer added that an
other purpose of his visit here was to
buy food supplies for his trip in this
country because prices in Europe were
: prohibitive.
; Amundsen said his ship would be
| ready for launching in March and
|that the work of equipping her would
begin in July 1917 but that no effort
l would be made to get away before
jthe following year so he might, have
| plenty , of time to complete his prep
| nrations. The start was originally
! planned for 1917 but was delayed on
i account of the war.

The Teutonic campaign against Ru

The immediate threat to the capital
seems to be greatest on the southwest,
where the invaders have approached
to within fifty miles, after Field Mar

Two Houses Destroyed in
Fire at Bonnymeads
Early Saturday afternoon fire de
stroyed two bouses and damaged three
other buildings on the Bonymeads
farms, east of Paxtang. A high wind
kept the flames away from a large
barn in which were 100 head of prize
T L' e , ,otiU ,oss iH estimated at
S-,000 and is partially covered by in
surance.
The houses destroyed were occupied
by Frank Baughmoyer and Arthur
Myer, who are employed on the farms.
Ihe houses damaged were those of
Harry Furlough, the barn on the Metz
farm, adjoining Bonnymeads, and the
home of George Shearer.
The tire started in the Baughmoyer
home in an upper story. It is believed
sparks from a tire used to smoke meat
started the blaze. The two houses
were built together and the flames
spread rapidly. Sparks were carried
to the Furlough and Shearer homes
There are water plugs throughout
the farms, but due to the high ele-
I vat ion of the houses the pressure was
not sufficient to reach the flames.
: Bucket brigades made up of the em-
I ployes and neighbors fought the
i flames.

General criticism was heard through

dissent.
For some time there has been a
growing protest, among the people
against the Increase of overhanging
signs and banners across the streets
in defiance of public sentiment and
contrary to police regulations. It was
inevitable that objection would come
to this sort of thing and the streamer

"Don't Make Me Laugh,"
Chuckles Chicago Egg King
Chicago, Nov. 27. "The public
laughed when I was stung last year.
Now I've made a million. Don't
make me laugh, my lip's cracked,"
chuckled James E. Wetz, the egg
king, to-day.
The alleged possessor of 72,000,000
priceless jewels of the poultry yard,
plump and ruddy, admits he's getting
a lot of fun out of the situation and
refuses to worry about a boycott or
even threats of city officials. Indeed,
he hints that he'll start a little more
fun by instituting legal proceedings
against city fathers who have talked
boycott.
"Seems to me I've heard boycotts
are illegal." he said, as be bit off the
end of a fresh Havana. "Just because
I the old hen has quit laying isn't any
reason why I shouldn't hang on to ail
I have. Still there's a limit. The
dinged eggs won't keep more than
ten months, hut by then—February 1
—they'll be worth 70 cents a dozen."

I "the other woman." On Friday, it is
i said. Miss Crosbie visited the Snyder
