Believed Large Foroe Is Massing
For Attack on American
Border
El Paso, Nov. 27—Mexican refu­
gees arriving here in a deplorable
condition declare that General Tre
•vino has evacuated Chihuahua City
and that 40,000 residents are at Villa's
mercy. Murder, pillage and rapine
and the torch followed the entry, of
the bandit chief. The report that
Villa controls the city is unconfirmed
from other sources.
General Gonzales, de facto cpm
mander, is hurrying all available sol­
diers north of Chihuahua to tba re­
lief of Trevino. A garrison of 150
Carranza soldiers was withdrawn
from San Juan and Buen Ventura.
Other small forts were emptied to
swell th numbers of the army nlarch
ing 16 the relief oj General Trevino.
General Mascotts, with 3,000 de
facto troops, is marching north of
Sahta Rosada' to aid the beleagured
garrison. Bridges south of Chihua­
hua City have been .burned and it will
take several days for the relief forces
tq reach Trevino.
General Gonfeales hits received' a
report that a band of-Villistas under
General MuCgula is beaded for the
border.
Rumbling oif eannon reported to the
telegraph operator at Sau*.station by
refugees and,:j*£tayed' to General (Fran­
cisco Gonzales:
"at military headquar­
ters here convinced the chril and mili­
tary officers that General Trevino,
Carranza commander, still held Chi­
huahua City at'tho'dose of the three
days' siege hy Villa' and his bandits
Aside from this information, the
commanding officers in Juarez knew
nothing late tonight as to the day's
developments in the state capital.
Telegraph Line Cut.
The federal telegraph line which
runs into the military headquarters
at Juarez has been silent since 10 a.
m., when communication with Chihua
vhua City was interrupted, soon after
General Trevino sent a personal mes­
sage to Mrs.' Trevino assuring her of
his safely.
The telegraph line is in operation
from Juarez tcf Sauz, the first station
north of the •capital, but Carranza of­
ficials said it had been cut between
that station and Chihuahua City..
Villa Attack Shifted.
The suspension of wire communi­
cation is considered by Carranza mil­
itary officers here to indicate that!
Villa has moved around to the north'
and northeast of Chihuahua City and
is attacking from that side in the
hope of avoiding the curtain or lire
which the Carranza artillery has been
pouring into the ranks of the bandits.
Americans familiar with the topog­
raphy of the city say Villa will be
able to make his way into the city
«proper from the north without en­
countering artillery fire.
Battle Before Dawn.
Before the telegraph line was cut,
brief reports of the third day's bat­
tle for possssion of Chihuahua City
received by the military here told of
the preliminary skirmishing just be­
fore daWn, which developed into a
general attack at 4:30 a. m. A mes­
sage was recevied' today announcing
the departure of General Fran*sco
Murguia's cavalry column from the
railroad line near Santa Rosalia for
a forced march overland to Chihua­
hua City to relieve General Trevino's
troops.
Denies Report of Fall.
When informed of a rumor in El
Paso that Chihuahua had fallen be­
fore Villa's attacks, Andres Garcia,
inspector general of consulates, said:
"There has been absolutely nothing
received here to indicater such' an
event, and we control the only avail­
able sources of information. From
our knowledge of the defenses of Chi­
huahua and of General Trevino's re­
sources in men and arms, we do not
feel any uneasiness."
Mr. Garcia, General. Gonzales and
other Carranza officials attended a
banquet here tonight.

Marion Letcher.
Marion Letcher, U. S. consul, has
fieen on the job in Chihuahua city,
the centcr of Villista activity, ever
tince President Wilson gave the
order to "tafce Villa, dead or alive."
He is in the interior at a point from
which egress would be difficult in
case of actual danger. Mr. Letcher
has been in Mexice as U. S. consul
five years. Although he is only 34
years old he was a company com­
mander in Cuba during theSpanish
American war.
The suicide was. identified here

MBUUKPB
Major Steedman, military adviser
to Governor -Hanna, has almost com­
pleted inquiries on array ambulances,
one of which is to be purchased for
the North Dakota boys by donations
made some months ago.
It has been hard to get delivery on
the style of the ambulance desired
and all" that is necessary to close the
deal is to ascertain the nearest point
to Mercedes at which delivery can be
made. It is expected that within a
short time Major Steedman, E. H.
Dummer and others in control of the
fund will have the definite data.
The Tribune has turned over $621,
its total collections, to Major Steed­
man. More is held by Mr. Dummer
and when all donations have been col­
lected, it is expected that the fund
will total more than $700.
It has been found that the Ford
army ambulance i# best suited to ser­
vice on the border. Many of them
are in use on the French front and
are giving excellent service. This Is
the type of an ambulance that will be
purchased for the North Dakota regi­
ment. The state of Ohio purchased
several for the use of the Ohio regi­
ments. deeming the type more suit­
able than some of the other ambu­
lances on the market.

$125,000 TO BE PUT

With a majority of almost 16,000 on
official returns from all but Eddy,
Mercer and Oliver counties, and* with
a certainty that the lead will be en­
hanced by the vote of the two miss­
ing counties from west of the river,
the Dickinson normal school is a cer­
tainty. The official count, with three
counties yet to be heard from, stood!
this morning 56,376 for and 40,802
against. The vote is abnormal, show­
ing an unusual degree of interest the
state ovf.
Appropriation Asked.
The fate of the Dickinson normal
definitely determined, the state board
of regents this morning presented to
the budget committee estimates of
the sums which will be required by
the institution for the ensuing two
years. The total Is $252,500, divided
as follows:
Maintenance, two years.. .$40,000
Grading and grounds 2,500
Water and sewers 3,500
Plumbing and wiring 9,000
New Buildings.
Main building 125.000
Girls' dormitory 5Q.000
Central heating plant..... 10,000

physiological laboratory, 2,500
$125,000 for First Unit.
The $125,000 askqd for is to. pro­
vide for the first unit of the main
building, wliich probably will supply
sufficient room for the first biennial
period, at the end of which time a
wing will be added. A dormitory for
girls is regarded imperative. In in­
come itepis, the board of regents anti­
cipates $500 in tuition fees for the
normal $3,500 for general mainten­
ance, a total of $252,500. The amount
is practically the same asked for the

New Life Insurant* Company
Makes Excelent Record
Since July 1
With its state agency'force well or­
ganized, and with $700,000.01) worth
of actual business on i,ts books, the
Provident Insurance Co. of Bismarck,
the youngest of North Dakota's "Old
Line" life companies, may he said to
have fallen into its stride
The Provident now has policy-hold­
ers in practically every fc^nfo in tbp
state. Ifehu»lHe*,'*hr'(jWI'frfeferwed
class, written moBtly through banker
agents, .who' are also stockholders,
and who comprise the greater part of
the sales force.
Chartered June 12, last, the Provi­
dent has written up to October 31,
when the last statement was issued,
$649,500 -in approved and accepted
risks. Since the first of November
more than $100,000 new business has
been.added, and each month's record
is surpassing the' former. When the
Provident received its charter it had
no sales organization. Its present
field force, one of the most efficient
boasted of by any life insurance com­
pany operating in North Dakota, has
been built up since July 1. As prac­
tically every agent is also a stock­
holder, there is a double incentive not
only to write insurance but to write
risks which will bear the closest ex­
amination. In many instances the ex­
aminer as well as th agent is a stock­
holder.
The funds, of the Provident Insur
ance Co are being invested in first
mortgage farm loans within the state.
The security is gilt edge and the in­
terest return altogether satisfactory
As generally as is practicable, the sur­
plus is being reinvested in the terri­
tory which originates the business,
and this is tending to popularize tho
company in territory where farm
loans are much in demand.
All of the company's policies are
selling well. Probably the one most
in demand is the "savings accumula
tion" policy, which offers the pur­
chaser the combined advantage of se­
curity and saving.
To date the Provident has confined
its operations to North Dakota. Now
well established here, it is planning
January 1 to enter the state of South
Dakota. Later the company will in­
vade other states.
While the company is new, its of­
ficers are old in the insurance busi­
ness. W. C. Taylor, the president, is
insurance commissioner of North Da­
kota. O. S. Basford, the vice presi­
dent, formerly was insurance com
missioiir for South Dakota F. L.
Conklin, the secretary, has grown up
in the geueral insurance business, and
is head of one of the largest agencies
in central North Dakota H. B. Beach,
actuary and assistant secretary, earn­
ed her insurance experience in Illin­
ois, where she was connected with
some of the largest companies N.
B. Fitch, state director of agents, has
spent more than a quarter of a cen­
tury in similar capacities with sub­
stantial eastern companies. Dr. W.
H. Bodenstab is medical examiner.
The directors of the Provident are
all men of established standing in
their several communities. J. L. Bell
is vice president of the First National
bank of Bismarck H. H. Dahl is vice
president of the State Bank of Norma
W. L. Richards, president of the Mer­
chants' National bank of Dickinson'
H. B. Allen is a prominent merchant
of Jamestown H. H. Steele is a mem­
ber of the North Dakota tax commis­
sion and president of the First Na­
tional bank of Mohall W. H. Mann of
New Salem, a merchant, banker and

mission Dr. L. S. Platou, a well
known physician and farmer, is may­

established attorney of Jamestown
John E. Reuter is vice president of
