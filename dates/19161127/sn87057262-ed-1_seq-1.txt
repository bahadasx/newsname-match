LONDON, Nov. 27.—News'from Ger
man sources caused a renewal of hope
here today that Rumania may, after
all, extricate herself irom the precar
ious position in which her Wallachian
forces have been placed by Von
Falkenhayn's strategic campaign.
Of prime basis for this hope, waB
the utter lack in all the German re
ports of any claims of any large cap
tures of prisoners or war munitions.
If the, Rumanian army had actually
beeri~"trapped by the encircling move
ment around Orsova and Turnu-Sever

ports would have chronicled big cap
tures of men and supplies. Further
more, ft Is known here that the Ru
manians succeeded in removing all of
their artillery from Craiova before
that city fell Into the hands of the en
emy.
One other source of hope was the re

As near as can be estimated here,
from official statements on .both sides,
the battle line in Rumania now runs
approximately from the Transylvanlan
Alps north to Campomng southeast
ward to a point a little north of Cur
tea De Arges and thence to the Alt
river, probatoly somewhere about
Komuca. Following southward down
the Alt, the Rumanians apparently
hold it to a point slightly east of Sla
ting. Eastward again this line runs
to a point a little north of Alexandria.
Here the Rumanians are at grips with
tiro forces which crossed the Danube
in an effort to turn their flank. Still
farther east along, this southern front
is Giurgia, where attempt has been
made to force a crossing of the Dan
ube by the Bulgarian-German forces.
This point is a bare forty miles due
south of Bucharest.

delayed because of the condition of.
the roads. Botfi of these ibits of news
led military experts here to recon
struct a story of an orderly retreat of
the Rumanian forces from the angle
on which two arms of the Teutonic
forces are now exerting exceeding
pressure. There was no disposition,
however, to disgpise the fact that Ru
mania Is still ^perilously Placed. If it
were summer weather and if the ter
rain were not rain-s6aked or muddy
from half frozen slush, the crossing of
the Danube by the Teutonic forces in
an effort to turn the flank of the Ru
manians, might prove successful. As
it is their presence on Rumanian Boil
constitutes an ever present menace.
Reports here say that a number of
allied aviators have reached Bucha
rest. It is believed
alBO
that Russia
has by this time poured heavy rein
forcements into Rumania, probably in
cluding a large number of cannon. The
greatest handicap which the Ruman
ians have had was their lack of aerial
scouts to seek out and report the sort
of encircling movements which have
formed the basis for Von Falkenhayn's
success. Their artillery also, has been
outranged by the Germans.

CHICAGO, Nov. 27.—Prop $85,000,000 worth of food stuffs are held in cold stor

After discovering spoiled eggs in storage in two big refrigerating houses here, Dr.
Robertson today turned his investigations into meat and poultry conditions. His efforts will
be confined to enforcing the ordinance limiting the time foods can be held in storage and to
confiscating spoiled or deleterious foodstuffs.
Following predictions that eggs may reach sixty cents a dozen soon, Mr. Robertson
held Qut some hope of relief by saying that eighty-five carloads of eggs belonging to James
IB. Wetz, "egg king," would be forced on the market January 1 by the ten months limit.
Other, storage houses would be affected in a similar way, he believed.
