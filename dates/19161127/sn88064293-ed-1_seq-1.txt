DONT FORGET YOUR
CONTRIBUTION TO
TOE REVIEW ROLL
AND TOT FUND
i Anticipating a visit from old
"Kris Kringle," there are many
yearning little hearts in Morgan City
' who have already planned to write a
I letter to Santa Claus, informing him
of just what each little "tot" desires
for Christmas. Altho the date is
some weeks off, yet the Review Doll
and Toy Fund, to be distributed by
the King's Daughters, has grown to
over a half hundred dollars. Many
have expressed their intention of as
sisting in making glad these little
hearts, and the Fund is expected to
reach proportions surpassing the rec
ord of 1915.
In matters where generosity is in
volved, eitzens of Morgan City are
known to be open handed and open
hearted, especially where charity is
involved.
We invite the good citizens of
Morgan City to assist us in helping
th" King's Daughters make 1916 a
year long to be remembered by the
poor and needy children of Morgan
City. We know in advance they will
do it.
Funds may be deposited at the
Peoples State and Saving Bank, or
the Bank of Morgan City and the
First National Bank will accept de
posits from customers for this fund
The banks are always generous in
matters of this kind.
The good ladies of the King's
Daughters have volunteered to de
vote sufficient time and attention to

It is reported that since Dayton
has been under the management of
a business man fewer babies have
died. We are told that the <jity mana
ger is invested with sufficient power;
political independence to serve with
j out the restraint of those considera
tions of political expediency which
I sometimes circumscribe the service
lof less independent executives. We
; are told moreover, that the Dayton
j manager is "much keener to have
I the poorer quarters of the town
j cleaned up and made attractive than
■to make the naturally beautiful parts
: of the city more beautiful." And
' in these two statements we find the
: reason that fewer babies die in Day
ton than died there before the
government was less adaptable to the
immediate and complete execution
of health laws, it is one thing to as
pire to reduce the mortality of in
fants by removing physical causes
that contribute to the death rate,
and it is wholly another thing to suc
ceed. The improvement of sanitary
conditions is a cause that enlists uni
versal support in the abstract. In
fhe concrete, it is more apt to be op
posed than aided by interests im
mediately affected by it. Especially
is this so when progress entails a
the distribution of this iuml to
reach every poor and needy child in
.this city. Won't you, our readers,
! lend your assistance to the good
! ladies in helping them find all
j children who should receive a Christ
mas present out of this fund'.'
j The list is already well started,
|and we urge these who desire to
' make some little strangers heart
glad this coming Christmas to send
j in your "gift" without delay, in
1 order to encourage those who might
I be a little indifferent,
j Letters written to Santa Claus
I from needy children, or those who
I will vouch for same, will be forward
I ed on to the cold regions where old
"Santa" has long made his head
: quarters.
i All funds contributed to The Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund but contributions will be
accepted by the hanks of Morgan
City and by a number of the busi
ness men. Be certain that your name
and the correct amount you contri
bute appear in the colums of this
paper.
