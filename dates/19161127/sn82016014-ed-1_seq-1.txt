Knapp was engaged in newspaper
work in Beloit. Appointment of Turn

than from political reasons, Knapp
stated.

Again Is Impending.

Rome, Nov. 27. Dispatches from
Athens today declare resignation of
the cabinet is imminent.
Dispatches from Greece during the
last few days have indicated impend
ing dissolution of the cabinet formed
on October 10, by M. Lambros. A re
port Saturday declared that the minis
ter of justice had resigned. With the
demands made by Admiral Fournet, of
the allies for disarmament of Greek
forces and the "provisional" or revolu
tionary government under former
Premier Venizelos at Crete, taking a
determined pro-ally stand, the neutral
ministry is evidently hard put to keep
its stand. The Lamros ministry is the
fourth formed in Greece in as many
months.

is the highest minimum since Novem

the forecast, which calls for generally
fair weather tonight and Tuesday;
somewhat colder tonight, warmer
Tuesday. Tomorrow the mercury will
reach a point about equal to today's
maximum, S. D. Flora, local weather
observer, stated this morning.

MURDER IS FOUND
Coroner's Jury Verdict on the
Death of Calvin Hayes.
Blows Inflicted on Head by a
Blunt Instrument.
LOOKING FOR A TALL MAN
Wore a Dark Overcoat and
Big Skating Cap.
Mrs. Patsy Mulligan Only Per
son Who Saw Him.
Calvin Hayes, the 76-year old To
pekan found mortally injured in a
stairway in North Topeka Friday eve
ning, was murdered.
That is the verdict of the coroner's
jury sitting in the case at the inquesc
held today in the court of Topeka.
The verdict goes no farther than that.
The Jury found that the aged uan
came to his death from blows on the
head inflicted by some blunt instru
ment in the hands of an unknown
person.
The murder, " it was murder, was
committed between 5:20 and 5:30
o'clock Friday evening and some
where on Kansas avenue between
Railroad street and Curtis street, a
distance of one block, and in daylight.
Mrs. Patsy Mulligan, in whose
rooming house at 600 North Kansas
avenue Hayes lived, testified that at
5: SO o'clock she left her room and
started down stairs to purchase some
groceries. She testified that when she
reached the head of the stairs some
strange man was helping Tlr. Hayes
in at the door at the foot of the stairs.
The person most sought after by
officers working on the case is the
stranger who helped Hayes in at the
door. Mrs. Mulligan could not give
a' complete description of him and
could not say whether he was white
or black.
"He was tall and wore a lorg, dark
colored overcoat," she said. "He had
the collar turned up about his cheeks
and he wore a 'skating' cap pulled
well down over his ears and forehead.
About all I could see of his face was
his nose and mouth. He did not
come entirely in the door. He had
Mr. Hayes by the arm and merely
helped him inside."
The Mysterious Stranger.
"If the stranger who helped Mr.
Hayes into the hall is on the square."
said Robert Garver, assistant county
attorney, "I fail to see why. he has not
made himself known. He could shod
considerable light on this case. Even
tho he may have had nothing to do
with the man's injuries he may know
how he was injured. We will continuo
the -search for- him."
Dr. C. M. Hensley was placed on the
stand to testify as to Hayes's Injuries.
He described them in detail to the
jury. There was one fracture at the
base of the brain running almost from
ear to ear. There was another fan
shaped fracture just over the forehead,
radiations of which ran for several
inches. There was also a depression
in the skull in front below the hair
line.
"Either of the fractures would have
been suflicient to have caused death,"
said Dr. Hensley. Dr. Hensley was
skeptical about the two fractures hav
ing been caused by a fall.
Dr. Marcotte, coroner, stated that
both fractures could not have been
caused by one blow. He also stated
that no man could have walked with
such fractures.
Before bringing in the verdict the
jury visited the Penwell undertaking
establishment and viewed the body.

"They seemed very congenial." He
said the accused man represented him
in the divorce proceedings; another. -t-torney
represented his wife, he said.
"Was there" anything toetween -you
and your wife in which McDaniel was
mixed up?"
"There was not," Krucker answered.
"Was there ever such a suspicion in
your mind or is there now?"
"No," he answered.
The state examined at length con
cerning the divorce and brought out
the fact that it had been obtained the
same day Mrs. Krucker filed her peti
tion. Mr. Krucker went to th.i McDaniel
home about 6 o'clock the night the
prosecutor's wife was murdered to ob
tain possession of his child which Mrs.
Krucker had sent there.
Advised Aeainst Divorce.
"Did not McDaniel advise your wife
against a divorce?" he was asked by
the defense.
"Yes," Krucker answered.
Mrs. Orestes Lltchell. wife of Mrs.
Krucker's attorney followed Mr.
Krucker on the stand.
Mrs. Krucker came to the McDaniel
home the afternoon following the
n.urder, Mrs. Mitchell said. Mrs.
Krucker was there when Mrs. Mitchell
left at 9 o'clock that night and also
the next morning when Mr. Mitchell
returned to the home, the witness de
clared. Mr. Mitchell who is president of the
board of education, followed his wife.
"McDaniel's grief seemed very real,"
he said, telling of having seen the ac
cused man at the hospital before Mrs.
McDaniel died. "He seemed to have
collapsed p.nd lay on a cot."
Mitchell said he and several others
cleaned the room in which Mrs. Mc
Daniel was murdered, after having:
heard she had died.
McDaniel Will Testify.
Twenty-four witnessea having been
examined, it seemed possible that
either McDaniel or some of his imme
diate relatives might take the stand
before the day is over.
Judge C. F. Strop head of the de
fense counsel has announced definitely
that ho Intends to place the accused
prosecutor and his aged father, D. L.
McDaniel, one of the wealthiest farm
ers of Buchanan county, on the stand
before the defense reets. It also is
considered prcbable that the accused
prosecutor's mother, who believes
firmly in the innocence of her son
will be called to testify concerning the
relations between McDaniel and his
wife.
Children Not Witnesses.
It was doubted, in view of declara
tions of defense attorneys, if any of
the three McDaniel children Helen,
Marion and Odell would be summon
ed as witnesses. Odell the ten-year-old
boy appeared in court for the first
time Saturday as did the prosecutor's
moiner ana sat besiae his father,
whose arm was around him most of
the day.
The defense placed twentv-four of
the fifty witnesses it has subpoenaed
upon the stand Saturday. It was con

RUSH CARS TO
GOAL FIELD, IS
STATEJPPEAL
Attorney General Brewster
Would Relieve Shortage.
As'ks Utilities Commission to
Meet th Situation.
SEE BIG PRICE COMBNII
Producing Companies Seek to
Control Prices.
Plenty at Mines, but No Cars to
Haul It.
In an effort to relieve the coal '
shortage in Kansas, S. M. Brewster,
attorney general, today appealed to
the public utilities commission for an
order permitting the use of all possi
ble cars for the carrying of coal. The
application asks that all ears now used
in the shipment of sand, brick and
gravel be directed to the coal fields to
relieve conditions in this state. A
similar order will be asked of the in
terstate commerce commission." Th
orders are asked for a period of two
to three weeks.
Recent investigations by the attor
ney general's office have revealed an
almost nation-wide coal shortage.
The shortage is claimed to be due both
to a light output as well as a car
shortage. Added to these conditions
is evidence showing an unusually
heavy demand for coal hv rniir,ari
With the shortage of coal, prices
have gone skyward. Evidence is now
being gathered by the attorney gen
eral's office to show that a combina
tion has existed among certain pro
ducing companies in an effort to con
trol prices. Quotations on all classei
of coal have advanced from 25 cent
to a dollar or more a ton.
Short 478 Cars.
Records secured from offices of
seven .large producing companies in
this state are 'presented to the state)
commission, in Brewster's application,
j These records show that in one week
the producing companies were short
47 8 cars in their demands for facilities
I for the shipment of fuel. Had thesa
cars been provided by the railroads,
the operators would have dumped
zd.suu tons oi coal on the market In
addition to the output which dealers
received. . ...... ,
Both Kansas Citys now have less
than three days' supply of coal on
hand, according to records from th
investigation. The probe has extend
ed to other sections of the state. In
formation gathered by Brewster's in
vestigators show that the state could
not successfully combat a week or ten
days' severe cold spell. Regardless of
the merits of the claim of a combina
tion by dealers, the attorney general's
office has gatheied evidence showing
that orders for coal can not be filled.
Prices Have Advanced.
As a probable natural result of the
shortage, prices have gone up. Now
it is not so much a question of prica
as a question of supply. In many sec
tions of the state orders for coal can
not be filled at any price.
"Because of conditions, I have asked
the utilities commission to declare an
emergency and direct the use of all
sand, gravel and brick cars for ths.
I carrying of coal," said Brewster.
"Adoption of this order for a period
I of two or three weeks will greatly re-
Ileve the situation."
I Kansas slack coal, at the mines, la
now selling at $3 and $3.25 a ton. I's
ually this coal slls at the mines for
I $1.50 a ton. Domestic coal is listed at
; $2.25 to $3.25 and sells for $4 to $4.25.
I Prices on Illinois coal and other out
jputs have increased accordingly, ac
i cording to the statement filed with,
the state commission.
"Unless something be done to re
lieve conditions," said Brewster,
I "many families, especially among the
! poorer classes, will suffer In event of
; extreme cold weather They have
I been unable to buy their coal in ad
ivance.' Now they are facing the ab
! normally high prices and in many ln-
i niaiitf a win oe unaoie to buy fuel,
i even tho they might be able to pay the
price."
! One Kansn3 railroad that usually re
jquisitions 1,700 tons of coal a week is
! now using 2,200 tons a week. In many
I instances, it is reported, the railroad's
have filed on shipments of coal in
transit, :n order to keep trains run
: nirg. And in view of general condi
! tions, dealers in all sections of tho
; stats ha ve taken advantage of th ou-
portunity to boost prices.
