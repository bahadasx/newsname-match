HOW TRIB AND NEWS
BLOCK A FREE PRESS
,They Stand in the Way of the Trust Press Breaking Free
From Advertising Control How the White Paper
Situation Affects All Newspaper Employes.
BY N. D. COCHRAN
On the face of things the Tribune
is the only Chicago daily that is in
dependent of the news print manu
facturers, as through stock holdings
it controls the Ontario Paper Com
pany, Ltd., whose mill is located In
Thorold, Welland Co., Ontario, Cana
da,, with a capacity of 120 tons, of
news print a day. I understand this
capacity is being increased by the ad
dition of another machine.
Jhe Jjjb j$ Jrtkjrtn4nt so Ibn as
the mill runs, but in case of flood, fire
or other accident that would put the
mill out of business it would probably
be unable to get any paper from the
manufacturers, because their cus
tomers need more than they can
ftrake.
This is true also of the New York
World, Boston Globe, :St. Paul Dis
patch, and Pioneer-Press and Cleve
land Leader and News, the last two
being owned by Dan Hanna. These
p&pew- are all right so long m thei?
