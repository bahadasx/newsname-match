LEAPS 8 STORIES TO DEATH
Illness and Depressing Effect
of William Harris's Sudden
Death Cause of Suicide.
WAS BEING WATCHED.
Tried to Cut His Throat Two
Months Ago Attended to
Business Though,
In a nt of temporary Infinity. In
duced by Illness and minor business
' troubles, Joseph Brook?, tor ujany
jeara one of ths lcadlnr theatrical
managers and producers of this
country. Jumped from a window of
lifa apartment on the eighth floor of
Ilia Brixton, at No. HO West Seventy
ninth Street, at 8 o'clock to-day and
waj instantly killed.
Mr. Brooke's successful attempt at
self-destruction was his second In two
months. Previously no tried to slash
his throat with n razor.
It appears from statements mndo
to-day by members of Ws family that
Mr. Brooks, who, was sixty-five years
old, had been a nervous wreck for
some time, but ha managed to con
ceal his condition from all but close 1
personal frionds and bin home circle
until quite recently, lie attended to.
Hie details of bis business and was In
,:ictlvo chorgo of' the production ofi
"His Majesty Bunker Uean," which,
greatly to his disappointment, did not.)
prove a blc New York success, but is
by no means a financial failure.
His friends hay he died wealthy, hav
ing been Identified for many years
with such continuous and certain suc
cesses as "Ben Hur" and "In Old Ken
tucky." He had business Interests out
side the theatrical profession, too,
w,h!cn appear to have been successful,
( Mr. Brooks attended the Frederick
Maxkay benefit performance last Fri
day afternoon and met there William
If. Crane. He astonished Mr. Crane
by aaylng:
"Will, I'm afraid I'm losing my
-mind."
Others beside Mr, Crane heard the
remark. They talked to Mr. Urooks
and finally laughed away his mood
of depression. But it was learned to
day that for several weeks a mem
ber of the family or a close personal
friend has been close to the manager
whenever bo left his home.
Mr. Brooks arose at 7.50 o'clock this
morning and told his wife ho wanted
to get away early as he Intended to
walk down to his office. Mrs. Brooke
left him In his room and wont to
prepare his bath. While so engaged
she heard a crash in the courtyard
sad the screams of .servants work
ing In thi laundry in the basement
She hastened to Mr. Brooks's room.
He was not there and looking out the
window she aaw hla body, In pajamas,
lying on the cqurtyard pavement.
Mr. Brooks lived In the Brixton with
his wifo and his daughter, Virginia
Fox Brooks, an actress, sow playing
In the "Getting Married" company.
Miss Brooks was asleep li) her room
and was awakoned by the commotion
cau!l by th iraglo death of ber
father.
The sudden death of William
Harris on Saturday had a deputising
effect on Mr, Brooks. They bad been
close friends for many , years and
were often associated in business
ventures.
Brooks began his career as a the
I ?U deal manager as a box ofllco roan
His tactful personality and his ability
to niafco strong friendships soon

Losces In tho four day assault were
extremely heavy on both sides, ac

"Cannot estimate losses." rend, one
message, "but tho streets of tho city
nre filled wltli dead. Impasxlble to

throughout tho city damaged by shell
fire."
During tho early attacks Satuiday
Vllllastos penetrated north of the city
proper and maintained a foothold for
a time In Zaro Avenue. Machine gun
fire hurled them back. At another
time the bandits gained the Church
of Santurio de Guadelupn, on th west

holding tho Alt lltver from llomlcu-Valca southward to Soltlua.
Ilolow that point vou Falkcnbnyn'u forces had crossed tho river
and Joined with vou Muckenscn's army, coming north from the
