'The Lady From Montana'

dark brown hair, blue eye*
and a aonny, attractive face.

SEATTLE SHOULD
HONOR THIS HERO
WHO SAVES MANY
He saw certain death approach, but H.
L. Brannan, motorman, stood at his post.
He faced the end bravely, heroically, doing
his duty to the last, tho he could have saved
himself by relaxing his grip on the brakes
and jumping inside the car.
Of such stuff are real heroes made.
Brannan remained in the vestibule while
East Madison street electric car No. 15
raced down the steep hill from 25th to 29th
ave., late Saturday afternoon, and crashed
into another car. The vestibule was shat
tered to fragments.
The motorman was killed instantly.
There never was any chance for him. He
knew it. But he tugged and tugged at the
brakes. He was not thinking of himself.
He saw a car full of people, men and women
and children. He did his best to save them.
He gave all he could his life.
In Enumclaw, Brannan's mother has just
learned of her boy's brave death. He was
only 28.
Her heart is breaking yet how proud she
must be of him.
Seattle, too, is proud of Brannan, a real
hero. And Seattle must honor him as he de
serves.
They put up monuments for war heroes
—for those who are successful in the art of
killing.
What kind of monument shall Seattle put
up for young Brannan, who sacrificed him
self that others might not be killed?

This is the answer of Anna Louise Strong, explaining why she is a candi
date for one of the two places on the school board to be filled next Saturday.
And it is her answer, despite the fact that she has had experience in handling
thousands of dollars, preparing large budgets and supervising expenditures, while
employed as an expert in Child Welfare work by the United States children's
bureau in the department of labor.
