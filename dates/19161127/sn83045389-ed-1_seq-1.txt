OTIIKIt DOM K.ST lt" (ONTCIl.VS
It is now generally realized that the
labor problem overreaches all other
domestic concerns at this time. not ex
? ?ptinir that arising out of the high
cost of living. This is particularly
true with regard to railroad labor. |
Later developments have shown that
the passr.ge of the Adainson law post- j
poned instead of settled the trouble, j
The resort of the railroads to the |
courts, with the imminent possibility
that an injunction will be granted
holding up the operation of the law. j
lia* renewed the tight between the car
riers and the brotherhoods.
The purpose of tli^ administration to I
press for pa.-saue bills which ill make
.1 strik?* unlawful, until an investign- j
lion can he had, has aroused the bos- j
tilitv of labor organizations. This hos- i
tillty will !??.? letlected in Congress. ami
,! will In easily possible for the op
position to legislation to prevent
.t- pa.-yaU' : t a session that expires by
rtinitation.
It now scents practically impossible
for the Newlands commission to com
plete it:* hearings and render its re
port by January 0. the date fixed in
the resolution creating the body. Mr.
N'ewlands and Mr. Adam.ion are ex
pected to iri) before the House tttfl
Senate at the proper time and ask fo ;
an extension of time. This is forecast j
ly the delay already experienced b> |
the commission.
The railroads began their testimony I
on Thursday, but they may draw this !
out iud< finitely. Then, too. more than j
j score of interests have enterc"' ap- \
pearances before the commission j
representing the railroads, the ein- |
ployecs. the shippers, the Interstate!
Co'Minerce Commission and the State

' If the N'ewlands commission finishes
its hearings and aubniits its report by
March i. it will make greater headway
than most people believe possible. In
any event it iloes not seem possible for
the legislation which the commission
will present to be considered and pass
ed before March 4.
All these circumstances have con
vinced many people in Washington ?
that fotiKtess will be reconvened prob- j
ably in \pril for the specific purpose
(?f considering the pressimr necessity !
of railroad ami labor legislation. 11 (
the l'resident regards the situation as
demanding it, he will not hesitate to
call Con Kress together, because of the
likelihood that the- Republicans will
be able to organize the House. The j
measures which he will propose will j
have no more partisan hearing than !
diii the Adainson act. for which more I
than seventy Republicans voted.
Should compromises be reached be
tween th' railroads and their men and
nil threats of a strike withdrawn, and
should there appear to be no imme
diate p.ecd for other regulatory lou'ls- ;
la Hon than may be passed at the short ,
session, ihe extra session idea will be i
abandoned. Hut it is too much lo ex

The wounded who fell outside of the
city could not be rescued from the
"no man's land" beyond the. first-line

the bandits and the government forces.
It is t xpectod to send rescue parties
out to-night to briiiu in the wounded '

fell within the city are being cared for

serving as volunteer nurses in this

The troops on both the bandit and
government sides appear very tired
after throe days of almost constant
fighting. The government forces, how- '

brated the victories which they claim
over the Villa bandits as they hud

Inez Milholland Boissevain had been
for many years widely known for "lier
activity as a woman suft'ragist, a so
cial welfare worker, an advocate of
socialism and as n practicing lawyer.
As a student in Vassal- College, IM>.">
1&0P. although known ;.s the college
beauty, and possessed of wealth ami
position, she shunned society as such,
and shocked the more conservative col
lege opinion by her radical soeinl
views. One of her acts during this
period was to hold a suffrage meeting
in -i graveyard at ni^ht. when permis
sion to hold the meeting in the colh-pe
chapel had been refused 1 i-r. She also
made a name fop herself as an athlete,
being captain of her clans hockey team,
which won the colic; championship,
and n member of the 1!*"0 tr'ck team,
nt which time she established a new
record for the college in the ei-_*ht- ;
I fund shot-put. at thirty-one feet,
eight : ml seven-eighths inches.
Aside from her college activities, she ]
worked among tlx- poor children in the
city of Poughkccpsic, and had herself j
appointed court probation otllcer. I Mir
ing her first college vacation she
visited 'London, and there -.ined tli?
Pankhurst suffragettes, making several
speeches and being once arrested.
Muring the presidential cam
paign she won new funic as "the uirl
who broke up the Taft parade." While I
the parade was being held in New Vork !
City, she stationed herself in a window '
and shouted: "Votes for women!" j
through a megaphone. Some of the j
marchers fell out of the parade and !
gathered around h- r to hour her make |
?l spefch for fh< suffrage cruise.
Following her graduation from Vas
sar College. attempted to enter
Harvard Law School, but this permls- '
sion was dcni-^l her <?n the ground that
it was not a coeducational institution. ,
The incident gave rise in a heated
newspaper controversy, in which Inez

Koumania. apparently is in peril.
Klold .Marshal von Mack'em'en's troops
have crossed tho I mihiIm' from Bulga-"
rian territory to Zimnitsa and are in
lout-h near Alexandria. forty-seven
miles southwest of Rukharo.st, with tho
forces of Ceneral von Kalkenhayn's
I a: my from i.'i'alova. All along the
front on '.lie Wailachian plains east of
' "he Alt ltiver the Roumanians are in
i flight, limning towns behind thetn, says
| Berlin.
; To the north, on th<- heights of Cur
; tea-Dcarges. in the reuion of Dragos
hivele. northeast of Cainpuluug, and
in western Moldavia the Roumanians
are offering strong resistance to the
southward advance of the Teutons.
On all these sectors attempts by the
Autro-tierman forces to advance have
been held bach by the Roumanians.
! As yet there has been no indication
I of the arrival of Russian rc-enforce
; incuts to aid the Roumanians on tho
? Wailachian l'lains. but the Russo-Rou
inanian trooiis in Dobrudja are active,
possibly in an endeavor to push back
the invaders to the Tchernavoda-Con
stanza railway line. Sotia reports
that this re-enforced army intended a
general attack alotit the entire front,
| but has been compelled to confine It
? self to partial attacks.

I wing of tho entente allied line, where
the Italians have made further prog
ress toward Tarnovo, near the Monas

I'arls. This statement, as regards tho
gain, is contradicted by the Sotia War
? .?llice, which says an Italian attack
in re was repulsed, and that the at
tackers lost a large quantity of war
materials. Sofia also denies a recent
French report that the French had cap
tured the town of I*>ol?rotnir. saying lite
Bulgarians are fully in control there.
The French front also is experienc
ing another spell of Inclement weather,
and. except fo^small attacks at vari
ous points, little activity has boon
displayed by either side.
There has been considerable artil
j lery righting along the eastern front
at various places from the Riga re
gion to the Carpathians with the Ger
mans the aggressors, and also on the
Austro-ltalian front, with the Aus
trians on the initiative.
