being true, why should tho farmer sell
at 20 cent what remalnds In bis

to S3 cents a pound and the mill buy

cents and make good money. Very
many people fall to realize that cotton
Is both a peace and war article and
the world cannot get on without.
Should peace be declared now cotton
would lump 4 or 5 cents, a all Eu
rope is practically bare of cotton and
would have to lay in a big supply In
order to reopen Its textile Industries
for purely commercial outlets. Should
America enter the great war cotton
would advance 10 cents rapidly, as our
newly made arm would have to be
equipped with uniforms, overcoats,

for this purpose cannot be bad), re

mills are running out of raw material
nnd the cotton mill men are growing
uneasy for fear the same will be their
fate as to raw cotton. I think prudent
and far-sighted mill men will see the
Importance of the situation sufficient
ly to protect themselves. Why should
not the farmer share in all this great
prosperity as well as other producer
of raw material, such as metals, grains
and meats. No one ran say what nex
year's crop will bo nor state the price
It will command. We do know there
will be a gap of nearly eleven month
between the present time and when
new crop cotton will bo In sufficient
supply to In any degree relieve the
present scarcity. There bas been an
exodus of negroes from the planta
tions to the munitions plant, mine,
railroads, manufacturing establish

to bo poor, mules will be scarce and
high; the cost of fod stuffs Is also sure
to be wsy up In tho air; so that next

will be one of tho most costly ever

confident as to the future of cotton
