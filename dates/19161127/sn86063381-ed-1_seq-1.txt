JUDICIAL DITCH
County Auditor George Lets Contract
for Ditch No. 25 to E. A. Dahl
& Company.
COST IS SEVEN PER
CENT ABOVE ESTIMATE
Protests Made But Ditch Had Boca
Properly Established and Bonds
Sold.
Contracts for the construction of
Judicial Ditch No. 25 were 1st at
two o'clock this afternoon to B. A,
Dahl & Company of Duluth, by J. L.
George, county auditor.
The ditch is to be constructed
north of the Red Lake and is to be
324 miles in length The estimated
cost was $404,565 29 E. A. Dahl
& Company ,in competition with a
dozen other ditch contractors, bid
$433,051 66, or seven per cent above
the engineer's estimate.
Former Bids Rejected.
Bids for the ditch were rejected at
the former lettings because the bids
were considered too high by County
Auditor George.
When the bids for the construction
of the di*ch were opened several
weeks ago a number of Bemidji, Ten
strike and Blackduck citizens pro
tested against the letting, stating that
the county was already bonded to too
great an extent and requested that
the ditch be held up until some rem
edly could be found for the "ditch
evil
Protest is Late.
No protest was made, however,
hen the ditch was established The
ditch had been advertised, bonds had
been authorized and sold but not de
livered and bids had been received
before the protest was made. In or
der that those who protested could
take any legal steps possible, County
Auditor George held up the letting
until today Several days ago citi
zens met with Judge W Stanton
to secure relief ,if possible Several
homesteaders who live near the pro
posed ditch pointed out the need of
a ditch in that territory and stated
that there were a large number of
homei-teaders in the district It was
shown that certain portions of the
ditch were necessary Judge Stan
ton was urged to divide the ditch, but
on account of the advanced stage of
the project was unable to do so
"The ditch has been properly es
tablished," said County Auditor
George today, "aud I cannot see why
it should not be let. The bids are
low, lower than at three previous let
tings The land will be sold at the
tax sale of 1919 and I am of the
opinion that every vacant acre of
government land will be sold and
filed on
