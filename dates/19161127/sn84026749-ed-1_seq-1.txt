grocery estaUllafimcnt of Mooreland
Brothers, 1113 Fifteenth street, and
escaping wjth. $400 In 'cheeks and 'cash
while scores of families slept In the
Sherman apartments, adjoining.
Not the slightest clue has boon oh
talned yet by the scores of policemen
and detectives who started work on
tha case shortly after the dlscovfary of
the crlmo about S o'clock this morn
lag.
Only One Heard Noise.
On)y one person, a colored woman,
living In the small frame house which
adjoins the grocery on the north, heard
the explosion which forced the Ursa
Iron doors of the safe.
This woman told the police that she
heard the noise but thought simply
that the proprietors of the .tor-) had
decided to move certain fixtures In
the establishment on Hunday night,
while no business was being done.
She says she heard the explosion
about 11 o'clock.
Accused of Other Crtmr.
There Is no doubt In tha minds of
the detectives assigned. to tha case
h.t ih r..v.m ,, i,i.w An.n
that the craukamen who blew open
tha safe are the same men who sev
eral months ago wrocked tho lock on
the safe In the establishment of F. K.
Chaconns & Ilro., the Ioulslana ave
nue produce dealers, and escaped with
several hundred dollars.
The police frankly admitted after
a careful study of the Mooreland safe
cracking that the yeggmen are pro
fessionals of a high order.
I.lttle Damage o Huff.
Tha cracking of the safe was ac
complished with only little damage
to the big Iron rccoptacle.
Only sufficient nitroglycerine was
used by the cracksmen to blow open
the small box containing the combina
tion. Only a rmalfhole; about a quarter
of an Inch In diameter, waa drilled
I ft tha safe door, and this hole, coupled
with tha wrecking of the little box, In
which the combination rested, was all
tha damfcgo done.
Small Fuse Found.
A small piece of fuse on the floor
was the only part of tha burglars'
working kit left behind.
'That not a pano of glass waa broken
or cracked In the little cashier's
"cage," In which the safe reposed, and
which Is constructed mostly of glass,
ia one tribute to the skill of tho
yeggmen who committed the crime.
The cracksmen gained entrance to
the store by climbing the fence In the
rear and deftly removing a panel
from a rear door.
Their Task I'nsy.
Their task from then on was an
easy one.
They wera sufficiently screened
from tha street by the counters of
the store and safe In front of which
thev worked, mora than fifty feet
from the front. of the .establishment.
Arthur Mooreland. one of the pro
prietors, said he waa In the place
shortly after ( o clock laat night. He
said that the loot obtained by the
cracKsmen invoiveq bdoui iu in
cash and the remainder In checks.
Most of the latter, he said, wera
listed by the bookkeeper, and tho
payment on them can be readily
topped at the banks.
FUNSTON DENIES REPORT
Calls Story of Pershing's Attack on
Chihuahua Absurd.
By StafT Correspondent.
BAN ANTONIO, Nov. 27. "Absolute
ly ridiculous and utterly absurd," said
Gen. Frederick Funston today when
told of tha El Paso report that Gen
eral Pershing was moving on Chihua
hua City.
"General Pershing gets his orders
trom me. and from nobody else, as
far as I know," General Kunston add
ed, "and I have not told him to make
a move In any direction. Ho far as
I know, the United Htates army has no
Interest whatever In tho battle for
Chihuahua City. So long as they kill
no Americans It Is none of my busi
ness, and even If they do-it Is up to
the State Department.
"General Pershing lb not moving on
Chihuahua City, and unless somebody
goes over my head he won't."
There Is considerable speculation
here, however, as to why General
Pershing's column has not attempted
to get Villa, the commanding officer
of the punltlvo expedition having
known of the bandit leader's where
abouts for more than a month.

, now X"rnow,ky
LONDON, Nov; 27. It was officially
announeed today that the British
government has refused a safe con
duct, for Count TarnoW Tarnowaky.
recently appointed Austro-Hungarlan
ambassador to the United States.
- ' i
In official and diplomatic circles
here today tho opinion was expressed
that Count Tarnowskl will have no
difficulty In passing through tha An
glcFrench sea patrol, despite re
peated reports from London and Paris
to the contrary. To hold jip tho now'
Austrian ambassador would bo an act
of discourtesy to the United Btates,
It la said, and responsible officials In
Washington do not believe Oreat
Britain or Franca would commit such
an act.
The State Department has not made
a formal request for a safe conduct
for Count Tarnowskl and his party.
It merely called attention to the fact
that tho new ambassador Is scheduled
to sail from Rotterdam In December.
It Is believed that no further step will
be required to Insure his safo pas
sage.

HEADQUARTF.RH OF GENERAL
VON FALKENHAYN IN THIS TltAN
SYLVANIA ALPS (via Berlin and Bay
villa wlrcleaa), Nov. 24. "Our taak la to
destroy the, Roumanian army and that
we aro doing as, heat wo can."
Ho snoko General von Falkenhayn to
day his brows, wrinkled, but hla eyes
sparkling m ho submitted to questions
concerning the victorious progress of his
troops against Itoumanln.
"Our flyers," he continued, "report the
Roumanian roads hlnck with people and
wagons bearing refugees fleeing from
Little Wallachla toward the Alt river.
Tills Is tho terrible part of war. That
soldiers should suffer Is wsr, but that
women and children should be put to
such misery that Is terrible.

la to destroy the Roumanian army, and
that we are doing al best we can."
"May I aak another question, excel

The general's eyebrows mnv. un

sharply as only von Falkenhayn'

"When will tha Itoumanlan army ba
destroyed?" I asked.
Uncertainty la Certain.
A few officers standing near by
smiled. But Falkenhayn looked
straight at his questioner aa he said:
"Italn or snow, a railroad accident,
or most anything can destroy the
best-made plans. I have been In thla
war two and a half yeara, and can
aay the only certain thing about It Is

From Craiova, an Important Indus

hayn's advanced forces are working
north, south, cast and weat. To the
north and weat one ring la forming
and a second la being made to thn
south and west.
Today the Germans are occupying
all of the Little Wallachla territory
which Is the western one-fourth of
all Roumania -although' It will take
several days to clear out the Rou
manians hidden in the forests and cit
ies. Between seven and ten battalions
arn believed to be bottled up there.
Officers declare It will be Interest
ing to aea what the Roumanlana-dled
to do whether they will fight or sur
render. Splendid Progress.
Reports reaching Von Falken
hayn'a headquarters today Indicated
that the German operation, are pro
gressing splendid. It Is believed the
Roumanians will be forced to choose
a new line, as far back aa the Alt
river, thereby giving up the entire
weatern part of their country, with
Ita valuable stores, moat of which
are owned by Kngland. England
originally purchaaed theae to keep
them out of Oerman hands.
This Important success achieved by
von Falkenhayn will open the Danube
for many miles, enabling Important
transportation facilities.
As far as comment at von Falken
hayn's headquarters Is concerned, the
situation of the central powers
against Roumania Is regarded as
excellent. All five passes are now
In German and Austrian hands.
