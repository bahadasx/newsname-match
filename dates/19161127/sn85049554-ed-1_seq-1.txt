Sensational Red Oak Trial
Enters On Its Third
:.
Stage.
BROTHER OF MOORE
CONSULTED' SEER
Plaintiff Given Opportunity to Ridicule
"\Mrs. Tompkins' Story as Originated
'in Mind of Fortune Taller Jones'
Attorneys Severely Grill Landers,
Who Told of Seing Albert Jones En
ter Moore House Night of Murder.
[By Staff Correspondent.]
Red Oak, Nov. 27.—Counsel for Sen
ator Jones in his damage suit against
J. N. Wilkerson this morning centered
their attack, both on cross examina
tion find in- rebuttal testimony, on the
evidence given by E. H. Landers, of
Shenandoah, that on the Sunday night
of the Moore murder about 8:15
o'clock he had .seen a man whom he
believed to be Albert Jones go into the"
home of Joe Moore.
Landers was first given a further
cross examination. during which
Jones' counsel introduced in evidence
a letter which he admitted having
written from Shenandoah t,o Marshal
Horton at Villisca on June 23, 1913. In
this he said he saw the man enter the
Moore home "either on Saturday or
Sunday night." In answer to his un
certainty at that time he said the
statement was "evasive." Landers
said he "evaded his real conscience" to
r.hield Jones.
Tojp Poston, husband of Mrs. Lan
ders' sister, was put on the stand by
the plaintiff in rebuttal and testified
that on the Sunday evening in ques
tion Landers' wife was at his restau
rant helping and that Mr. Landers had
come down shortly after supper and
that they "sat and talked in front of
the dafe until 10:30 o'clock. He said
he and his wife had walked part way
home with them. Poston also said
that he served W. B. McCaull with his
breakfast after 6:15 o'clock on the
Xtfonday morning after the murder.
On cross examination he a4mitted this
was the first time he had ever served
breakfast to McCaull that early in the
morning.
Wilbur Landers, 14-year-old son of
E. H. Landers, was also on the stand
this morning for thf defense, being
called upon to testify that his father
had not gaten supper at homes, on., t}}$.
Sunday evening of the Moore murder.
.•*- (By a Staff Correspondent.)
Red Oak, Nov. 27.—The third inning
of .the sensational slander suit of'Sen
ator F. F. Jones of' Villisca against J.
N. Wilkerson, arising from the detect
ive's investigation of the Villisca ax
murder of 1912, wa& begun in district
court here late Saturday afternoon.
The defense formally rested its case
after 3 o'clock and the plaintiff "Imme
diately took up the introduction of re
buttal testimony. The past two weeks
during which the trial has been in
progress have seen two innings of the
suit threshed oiit before Judge Rooka
feller, and the Jury of twelve. For the
plaintiff, there were first witnesses who
testified of occasions and meetings at
which It is claimed Wilkerson made
the alleged slanderous .statements im
puting that Senator Jones was con
nected with the Villisca murder. Then
the defense entered upon its inning
and for the past seven days testimony
has been Introduced on behalf of the de
tective seeking- to cstablish.justiflnatlon
and to connecjr Jones with the tragedy.
In this inning of the trial which was
begun late Saturday plaintiff will aeek
to tear down and impeach the t^eti
mony of the defense.
Seer Started Story7
The day was replete with tense mo
ments as the trial progressed and In
one of these what the attorneys for
Jones characterized as the genesis or
beginning of the weird tale., of Mrs.
Vina Tompkins that she overheard a
murder plot on the banks of the Noda
way was revealed. It came when Ross
Moore, brother of the murdered man,
was on the stand, and he recited how
he had made a visit to the scene of the
old slaughter house on the Nodaway
where the plot was alleged to have
been heard. Asked as to how he came
to make this visit, he said that he had
gone there on the suggestion of Mrs.
Hamilton, a Red Oak character who
has gained some reputation as having
the power of second sight, etc., and
that she told him he would find an ax
there. Attorney Beeson, for the plain
tiff, brought this out with evident sat
isfaction.
Edward Landers was again on the
stand and subjected to a ferriflc grill
ing by'Jones' attorneys. He reiterated
nis statement amid almost breathless
silertce that he saw whom he believed
to be Albert Jones enter the Moore
home on the night of the murder. As
before, however,
(his
*K.'»
Jf$'
$S'
:spmw»
statement was
Qualified by the statement that he "be
lieved" it and this was surrounded with
somewhat more positive statements on
further questioning from the WUkn
son attorneys.
Few Witnesses After Wilker«#n.
The offensive had practically com
pleted its case- in. chief with the testi
mony of the defendant Wilkerson him
self but several witnesses were called
to the stand. Charley Moore, a
brother of Joe Moqre, was put on the
stand to tell of his dead brother's ex
periences, declaring that his brother,
Joe, had been in the employ of Sena
ion Jones for about twelve years, prior
to the time he established a business
of his own six years before hlB death.
Mr .Moore' said that when his brother
went Into business for himself and quit
the employ of Mr. Jones he took with
him the John Dure line/of implements
formerly handled by the Jones store.
His brother's business was "pretty
good* 'and growing at the time of his
death, Mr. Moore testified.
•Another brother of the murdered
man, Ross Moore, «was oq the stand
again, being, recalled to testify that
he did not go to the home of his
brother on the Sunday evonlng of the
murder.
Mrs. St H. Landers and Mrs. Alice
Fisher also testified briefly before the
defense rested. Mrs. Lunders declared
she walkeg. home from down town with
her huitoand, Kdward Landers, on the
.Sundarf-night bf the murder, as he had
testified/ When be suid he saw a man
enter the Moore home whom he be
lieved tobe"Albert Jones.
.Before the defense had nested its
case Senator Jones' counsel called him
back tO the witness stand for the pur
pose otiC Introducing a letter which he
received' in answer to the one he sent
to Chief of Police AVilcke,. of Blue Is
land iH., and which was Introduced in
evidence this morning by the defend
ant. Attorney Mitchell objected to the
introduction of answer into evidence
and although counsel for Jones argued
at length for Its admission, Judge
Rockafeller sustained the objection and
the jury' will not be permitted to see
what Chief Wilcke wrote to Senator
Jones in his Inquiry.
Mrs. Wiilard Recalled.
Mrs. Alice Wizard was again called
to the stand for further cross-exam
ination. Mrs. Wiilard testified on be
half of Wilkerson that on the Saturday
night prior to the M^ore murder she
had overheard a conversation between
five -men on the nortfleast corner of the
Joe Moore lot. In this conversation she
had testified she had heard the words
"Get Joe first, the rest will be easy."
She had identified four of these men
as Senator Jones, W. B. McCaull,
Mansfield and Hairy Whipple.
On his cross-examination Attorney
Beeson attempted to go into more of
her alleged detective activities.
