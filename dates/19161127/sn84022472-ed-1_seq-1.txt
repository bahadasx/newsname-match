is felt in shipping circles here in view
of the large number of passenger and

Not since the U-5 3 entered New

chant ships has there been so much
uneasiness in marine . quarters. ' It is
believed that the rperchant vessels of

SIXTH DISTRICT
REPOBLICAN CLUB
Daniels Lieutenants De
' mand Resignations of
I- Prominent Members.
COMPLAINT MADE
OF THREE WORKERS
Charge is That They Joined
With Forces of Opposi
tion to Daniels.
Dissension is again rife in the
Sixth District Republican club. It
is reported on good .authority that
President A. J. Knapp has been re
quested to ask for the resignatons of
Alderman Thomas Tierney, Charles
Kingston, . member of the board of
appraisal and George C. Wills, three
members of the club who are charg
ed with having deserted the Republi
cans on election day.
. Friends of Fred W. Daniels, defeat
ed Republican candidate 'for, alder
man, charge that the three men nam
ed after ' pledging their support to
Daniels "went, out to work secretly for
John F.' Clancy, Democrat, who was
elected by 11 majority. Six votes
forJDaniels would have given him the
election and his friends- claim that
.Tierney, Kingston and Wilis influenced
enough votes to defeat Daniels and
elect 'Clancy.
It Is well known that Daniels'
friends have approached Mayor Wil
son and asked that Tierney be kept
from important committees in the
new common council and also that he
be ignored if he presents petitions for
improvements in his district. Alder
man Tierney at present is a member
of the committees on fire department,
claims and unfinished business. As a
holdover alderman he, would be slated
for more important committees in' the
incoming council. .
Tierney is the only Republican
eyer elected to the council from the
Sixth istrict but the Republicans were
banking on electing another in the
person of Daniels, who to clinch his
popularity gave a big free clam bake
this summer to all Republican work
ers. Thomas J. Cunningham, dep
uty sheriff and district chairman, is
known to have, said that he had some
traitors in his force at the last elec
tion and that Was why Fred Daniels
failed to land.
Alderman Tierney denies that he
worked f or. Clancy and against Dan
iels. 1 jPrir to , election he " appeared
at ' Republican headquarters, and as
sured To wn ' Chairman . J. . A. H. Rob
inson that" he was for the ticket and
that he intended to work for every
man on ' it,' Daniels included. Dan
iels and his friends say this was but
a blind on Tierney's part.
Tierney has Jbeen independent ever
since he' was elected to the council
and has used Ills own ' judgment in
many matters' rather than abide by
party caucus decisions. It will be re
membered that he was one of the Re
publican aldermen who desired to
grant the: request "of the Lake Torpedo
Boat Co' to .close- certain streets in
the East End when the common coun
cil held up the matter.
Even ince the Republican club has
been organized the Sixth has been a
hot bed' of Republican dissension. The
old feud which ' crops out at every
primary meeting seems about due to
break out again. :

placed a gun in the pit of his
stomach and discharged the
weapon, ; when his wife,
thrown, into a state of hysteria
by the scene, screamed. The
threemen escaped and efforts

to apprehend them thus far
havexproved futile.; . f

to their identity the. police possess is
a blue overcoat which one of them

the killing. ' . 1 '

men, whom all described as about 21- .
years of age, and"' 5 feet 5 inches to 5 "

a club, while the other two gripped i
revolvers,' '
The storekeeper's wife and daugh

were in their home a the time.'
"Don't you move," cautioned the
robber carrying the club, walking
over to Garon.' .
"If you make the slightest noise,
or attempt to escape I'll eat your
brains out," he warned the storekeep
