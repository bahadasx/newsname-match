the continued pressure on the southern

Rumanian abandonment of the Alt

Bucharest announces this today reporting
also a Rumanian retirement
a little to the east of the Topolog rlv

Sofia today gives some details of

crossing at Zinimitza was made by

I
Judge Rules That Cases)
Against B. & N. Are Obligations
of M. R. R.
A Slavish woman, who told the judge,
through her interpreter that she was
-1 years old, and that her name was j
Miss Gillepels. appeared before Judge j
Haymond today and plead not guilty!
to a bootlegging charge. She was sent I
out to hunt a 5500 bondsman after it I
was explained to her with some difficulty
that her bond for $150 for her appearance
before the Judge today would
not be sufficient for her appearance
at the January term of court.
When brought into court Prosecuting
Attorney Haggerty expected her to
plead guilty and be had the disappointment
of standing by and bear her plead
"not guilty."
After she had told Judge Haymond,
"thank you" and "Good-by, Judge,"
through her interpreter, she left to
hunt a bondsman while remarks were
made as to how a woman who looked
to be at least 50 or 56 could tell the
Judge she was 21.
A dismissal of the case of the State
vs. Moore, docketed for today, was
argued for by Attorney W. S. Meredith,
who called the attention of the
court to the fact mat the case had been
coninued through several terms of Circuit
court, and that last term had not
been tried nor was there any record of
its continuance. This fact was lncor- _
porated by .Mr. Meredith into a'moUciT
to dismiss the case, since he argued 1
that an automatic dismissal of the case
had been effected.
Since there was no other state case
to be tried today, the jury was dismissed
until tomorrow morning.
The Moore case was to have been
taken up today and tomorrow but
while its status is being argued there
will be a short case moved up for tomorrow,
which the prosecuting attorney
believes can be finished in time
for the jurors to be permitted to be
with their families on Thanksgiving
day.
A number of orders were handed
down by Judge Haymond this moiu.ug,
most important of which was an order
respecting the cases against the Buckhannon
and Northern railway company.
There are a number of cases
pending against this corporation, now
defunct, having been incorporated into
the Monongahela Railway Company,
it was rule 1 that the obligations of the
old Uuckhannon and Northern were
properly the obligations of the Monongahela
Railway Company.

Officer Dent Holdon was appointed
city sanitary officer Saturday to take
the place of Sed Pitzer who will spend
hiH hours of duty out doors. The office
of sanitary officer is a difficult
one in Fairmont inasmuch as the city
commissioners demand cleanliness
even to the point of 100 per cent, efficiency.
Of the five hundred auto license
plates ordered for the current fiscal
year but eight remain. These eight
will be gone within a few weeks. In
order to prevent a shortage City Clerk
Albert Kern today ordered BO more to
have on hand for the remaining six
months. The license plates show that
at present there are 492 cars in the
city of Fairmont. There are others
no doubt which have no city plate on
them.
There may he no hearts in the bosoms
of policemen in many places but
In Fairmont there is a tingo of sentiment
in several of the cops it one can
judge from the lntorost they take In
the flowers and dumb brutes about wie
city hall. Each morning a cop can
bo seen carefully watering the flowers
and picking off the withered ends of
ferns and almost as often can they be
seen caring for some stray dog that
happens to get ousted from police society
and is left to feeft off oxygen and
tin can*.
