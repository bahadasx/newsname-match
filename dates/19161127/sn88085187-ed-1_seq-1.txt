WHEELER COMES AWAY FROM
FIRST BAPTIST FILLED WITH
IDEAS OF GLOOM, DEATH, SIN
By Edgar C. Wheeler
If you ever want to know
how to die, the vario'is ways
of dying, and all about dying
In general, my advice Is to
go to the First llaptist
church.
If you're a lost soul and
are making; arrangements to
kick up your heels, ilon't no
there.
It'll either make you mad
enough to end it all h;lm on
the spot, or it'll make you so
nervous you won't enjoy
your Sunilay dinner.
Frankly, I'm not at all in
ii'ri'-tc.i ill dying.
I was far from being In
terested In dying yesterday
morning when the warm sun
siiiiiiiiiil Into my window
and woke me up and tho
Missus said:
"Remember this is tiie day
you have to go to church!"
It was a great morning in
onr family.
\\ lii n the ftdks escorted
me in the sunshine to tin
car, I felt all dressed up and
proud.
Hears of 'Unsaved*
I was thinking of what a
good world it was after all,
es|iecia!ly in Tacoma, nntl of
how 1 could tell the eilitor
Monday morning that it
wasn't half bud, after all, to
go to church.
And then they had to go
and s|M)il it all!
"Broad Is the way that
lea<ls to destruction —and
the way Is crowded," pleaded
the Hey. James S. West with
hand on head and tears in
Ills eyes.
While the doors of the
rhurch at tub and Market
were barred to the beautiful
day, the good people of tho
congregation and I were giv
en plettii'4's of the torments
of unsaveil souls, of the Ta
coma boys mid girls mid
mothers anil fathers lost in
sin, of the blood that is on
the hands of us Christians
who fail to bring thorn back
into the fold.
Also we were given a first
hand statement of the
church's finances—but I will
come to that later.
Paid 'Em a Dime
I had to ask the editor this
morning if he wouldn't please
give somelKMly else the job
of going to church. I couldn't
help It. It was awful.
I sorry It had to bo this
way the very first day. I
have enjoyed lots of church
services in my day.
Some of you First Raptists
are going to be sore, bat I
can't help it.
I gave you a big broail hint
Saturday and you ignored It.
I asked you to let .me
down easy on the lost sinner
business, and I asked you not
to break your necks hauling
the wanderer hack into the
fold.
Y Tou did both. I've paid
my dime into your collection
box, so yon have no rope on
me.
I'm steering rlear of yonr
place from now on as if it
were a haunted house.
Won't This Jar the Stevedores!
Without waiting for further
parley over the wage Increase de
mands that brought about their
walk-out, union lumber handlers
of the port of Tacoma are pre
pared this week to compete with
their former bosses, the steve
dores, and take contracts for
handling cargo for lumber vessels.
The Tacoma Lumber Handlers'
association, a branch of the Long
shoremen's union, has affiliated
itself with the new Pugct Sound
Stevedoring Co., lncorported last
week.
This company is a co-operative
organization through which ship
owners or lumber mills may hire
union lumber handlers direct.
Still on Strike.
The lumber handlers are still on (
strike, although the longshore
men lost their fight some weeks
ago and have returned to work on
the open shop basis.
Large stevedoring companies on
Puget Sound have refused to
grant the demands for a wage in
crease by the lumber handlers,
and are employing non-union men.
The lumber handlers, who
maintain that their employment
takes a rank among those of
skilled labor, because It requires
unusual expertness to load lum

BY THE EDITOR
The conventional newspaper reporter would
nearly have dropped dead to receive the assign
ment J banded Edgar G. Wheeler Saturday.
It was limply tins: "(lit to sonic t-linrcli each
Sunday for the coining weeks, and give on the
following Monday ¥OUR HONEST IMPRES
SION of the minister, the sermon tnd the congre
gation."
Jn the 20th century slang, it isn't done.
However, Mr. Wheeler is doing it; which goes
to prove that he is not a conventionalised reporter.
The assignment was given, not with any inten
tion of muckraking the churches, hut I'or two
good reasons; first, to inform the non-attendant
what the churches of today are doing; second, to
give church people the benefit of an outsider's un
prejudiced viewpoint.
At almost any meeting of the ministerial alli
ance yon can hear a discussion on "What Is the
Matter With the Church?"
Mr. Wheeler's articles probably will Indicate a
few things that are wrong with the Tacoma
churches.
He is amply able to analyze the situation. Tie
was brought up in the strictest sort of Presbyteri
an and Baptist atmosphere and was educated at
the Presbyterian university of Princeton. Yet
since leaving his old ties he frankly confesses
himself to he a member of that \vvy large class of
non-church-goers.
Consequently his articles might t<> be enlighten
ing. Read what he says today about the hirst
Baptists.
Hut If some day you get
ready to forget the graven
and the dying sinners and
start out to tell folks how to
live, I'll accept au invitation
with pleasure.
The orgon was playing as

presence at my hack.
A hand reached around
and grabbed mine and began
pumping It up and down and
wouldn't let go.
"You're a stranger, aren't
you."—still pumping.
"I guess I am," I replied.
"I'm mighty glad to see
you here, brother" — still
pumping. "We want you to
Join with us again, and I hope
you'll come often."
Gives Him a Tract
The presence told mc its
name and asked mine.
"My name's Wheeler,"' I said,
and two liad boys in front of
me got their beads together
and giggled and took a look
at me out of tho corners of
their eyes.
The presence gave me a
tract to read while halting
for services to start.
I was beginning to feel a

HEROES!]
And They Are Both Men
Like You and Me
two more men whom probably no one,
and themselves least of all, suspected of
being heroes, have proved their right to the
title.
In Seattle, H. L. Brannan, a motorman,
stuck to his brakes and controller in the ef
fort to save his runaway car full of passen
gers, until the crash came that he must have
known would mean death to him. He could
have jumped, but he didn't.
In Portland, Willard G. Dieting delib
erately went back into a burning hotel, res
cued a girl, went back again, rescued his
roommate, went back a third time—and
never came out.
He was only 24, and life must have looked J
pleasant to him. But there were more peo- ij
pie in the burning building, and he went for
them.
Let's stop calling poor old human nature
names.
The man who sits next, you in the street
car, the man who sells you your groceries,
the man who grumbles with you over the
high cost of living, the man who ran against
you for office—perhaps even you yourself—
are the stuff that heroes are made of.
