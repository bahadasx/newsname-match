RUSSIA AT ODDS
WUHBRUAm
Intimates Resignation of
Premier Followed Stormy
Sessions of Duma.
Speeches of the Opposition
Leaders Touching on Sit
uation cut out by Censors
Berlin, Nov. 27.—(By wireless to
8ayvlUe.)—"Interesting details have
been received from Petrograd in re
ports regarding the happenings pre
ceding the resignation of Premier
Bturmer," says the Overseas News
agency today.
"The Petrograd and Moscow news
papers of November 17 and 18 pre
sent virtually nothing but headlines
and blank spaces. According to the
headlines the newspapers carried re-
Suma
orts regarding the meetings of the
which reports had been sup
pressed by the oensor. The military
oensor It is declared, prohibited even
reports of remarks made In the lob
bies, while the official news agency
Cvered
fcve out extracts from speeches de
by members of the extreme
conservative right wing.
"Apparently the president of the
duma, M. Rodzianko, coerced by the
military authorities, withheld the of
ficial minutes from publication while
the military censor suppressed in par
ticular speeches by Paul M. Milukoff,
leader of the Constitutional Dem
ocrats, and by the Socialist member,
Tschidse. M. Rodzianko, however,
finally announced to the newspaper
i.
Bhugin, leader of the left wing of
the Nationalists is declared to have
Stated: 'I am by no means a profes
sional opponent of the government,
but it is impossible to stand any long
er what this government dares to do.
We must tell the truth. Parliament
Is only guilty insofar as it has per
mitted this government to drag Rus
sia to the verge of a catastrophe.'
War Minister Congratulates Milukoff.
"During the meeting of the duma
the ministers also met. Premier
Bturmer suggested that the duma be
dismissed but to this M. Chouvaieff,
the minister of war, and M. Grigoro
vltch objected. The same two minis
ters appeared In the duma during the
debate the next day while the others
remained away. As the two minis
ters entered the extreme Nationalist
member, M. MarkOff, had just assailed
Professor Milukoff. M. Markoft'f
speech, it appears, also was sup-
Scatlon
ressed by the censor because its pub
would have disclosed to the
publio the contents of Prof. MilukofTs
speech. Both the ministers after M.
Markoff had ended, are said to have
descended into the hall of parliament
and shaken hands with Professor
Milukoff. War Minister Grlgorovitch
when asked whether he spoke in the
name of the government, is quoted as
answering that he 'spoke because the
interests of the national defense made
It necessary to work togther with the
duma,' these words creating a sensa
tion the members of the duma inter
preting them as antagonistic to Pre
mier Sturmer.
"The members of the duma after
debate resolved to answer the declara
tions of the government only when
the political situation was cleared up.
Meanwhile Premier Sturmer's resig
nation explained the unexpected atti
tude of the two ministers."
It has been reported through Stock
holm, according to a Berlin dispatch
of November 25, that the Russian gov
ernment is preparing to bring pro
ceedings against Professor Milukoff
tor his speech at the opening of the
duma in which he is said to have
touohed upon delicate points In- An
glo-Russian relations.

Von Falkenhayn Claims city
will be Uncomfortable place
When Firing Stars.
Hsrmannstadt, Transylvania, Nov.
7.—(Via Berlin and Wireless to Say*
Vflls).—At a luncheon which General
von Falkenhayn, commander of the
forces on the northern Rumanian
&
neutral correspondents he ramerked
ront, gave today to a small group of
SeutralAssociated
correspondents he ramerked
the Press representative
that although "nothing in this world
is so certain that one dare predict
anything with safety" Bucharest will
be an unoomfortable place for any-
8belrto
ne be In when the Germans get
guns trained on It.
Although General von Falkenhayn
sllned absolutely to commit himself
any prediction as to when this
jrbt oocur and even questioned the
purely military advantage of posses
sion of Buoharest with Its thousands
io feed when the same result might
he accomplished by gradually
decimating the Rumanian army, he
left not the slightest doubt In the
minds of his hearers that he consid
ered It a possibility of the Immediate
future. General von Falkenhayn was
^.reticent as to thep robable length of
the Rumanian campaign on the
ground that the continued spring-like
weather might hasten the end while
oron one sharp cold spell might
lengthen it materially.
$ Although refusing to assume the
role of prophet he appeared supremely
confident of the ultimate result He
paid the Rumanian soldiers the high
est oompllments upon their desperate
bravery and discounted stories of
oowardice or Inefficiency on the part
Of the Rumanian officers.

GOMPUSH
RUMANIANS BACK
Retreating Forces Mark a
Path with Burning Villag
es and Devastations.
London, Nov. 27.—The situation In
Rumania as described In today's news
shows that General von Falkenhayn's
forces having gained the railway at
Craiova have rapidly pushed to the
southeast and are according to Ger
man official accounts already In touch
with Field Marshal von Mackensen's
forces, which crossed the. Danube at
Zlmnitsa and advanced with equal
rapidity and now are before Alexan
dria.
The German reports do not state
where, the two forces joined hands
but say the roads leading eastward
from the Alt river are encumbered
with fleeing Rumanian supply col
umns and marked by burning vil
lages.
The Rumanian official communica
tion to a large extent corroborates
this news by reporting an engagement
with an enemy column advancing to
wards Roshiorl de Vede, on the rail
way a little north of Alexandria. Thus
the central forces now are within
flfty miles of Bucharest which is
threatened from the west, north and
south
German communique also brings
the interesting news that Field Mar
shal von Mackensen is personally
commanding the movement across the
Danube. There Is no indication yet
however as to what strength he has
been able to put Into this sector but
his movement seems to confirm the
Impression previously formed that his
latest wtlhdrawal into Dobrudja was
voluntary in order to assemble, forces
for tKe Danube crossing. Neither Is
anything definitely known as to
whether General von Falkenhayn has
transferred any considerable portion
of the forces lately engaged in forc
ing the Red Tower or Transylvanian
passes to the operations through Vul
can Pass.
Should Rumania be driven to de
fend Jhe line running north and south
from the mountains between Red
Tower and Toersburg passes to the
Danube In order to protect Bucharest,
military critics here consider tlyit her
position would be extremely critical.
It Is hoped however that Russia has
been able to' send sufficient reinforce
ments to relieve Rumania of the ne
cessity of devoting large forces to the
defense of her northern and Dobrudja
frontiers and that she will have suf
ficiently atronr forces to carry on an
effective fight (n tha wallachia pi«i«

Juarez, Mexico, Nov. 27.—Although

capital of Chihuahua, had been de

WITH PERSHING
IN TI«IT PLACES
Thrilling Experiences Re
counted by Uncle Sam's
Daring Birdmen.
Field Headquarters American Puni
tive Expedition in Mexico (Corre
spondence of the Associated Press).—
"Get there and back," is the motto
of the punitive expedition's aero
squadron. Censorship restrictions
have placed an almost Impenetrable
hedge about the army aviators, but
it may be said the squadron has lived
up to its motto.
Flights are not begun at sea level,
where the propeller blades can grip
the air, but at a height of 5,200 to 7,
000 feet, where the atmosphere is
thin. The mountains, canons and
sun-baked plains plus the altitude,
combine to produce air currents and
pockets that are a constant sour
of peril.
In one case a pilot went through
that nightmare of all avlatoro, a
spiral nose dive. The machine was
flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet,
which is more than 10,000 above sea
level, when it struck an air pocket.
Clouds obscured the pilot's vision and
he had no idea where he was. When
he realized that manipulation of his
controls produced no effect, he
glanced at his compass. It was turned
sideways, indicating that his plane
was falling with its wings at right
angles to the earth. Carefully he re
versed his controls, fearing that too
quick a reverse would crumple the
planes. Several times he did that.
At last he felt them take hold.
Just then, the clouds thinned and
he saw the earth not more than 500
feet beneath him. He had fallen like
a plummet at least 4,000 feet
Another pilot at an altitude of sev
eral thousand feet early one morning
noticed a sheet of flame shoot from
the hood of his machine. Startled,
he began to volplane down, seeking a
place to land. He throttled down the
motor and the flame receded. When
he gave the engine gas a few mo
ments later to regain momentum, the
flame reappeared. Several times this
occurred. Finally, he glided to earth
and got out to Inspect the aeroplane.
Everything seemed in good, shape.
There were no signs of fire. The
flame he had seen had been the rays
of the early morning sun gleaming
on the highly polished, red blades of
his propeller.

BRITISH WARSHIP
FLASHES WARNING

Incoming Vessels Shrouded
in Darkness and Life
Boats Ready.
New York, Nov. 27.—Apprehension
is felt in shipping circles here in view
of the large number of passenger and
freight steamers nearing this port,
and the reported proximity of a Ger
man submarine.
Rumors that two German sub
marines had broken through the al
lied cordon and are enroute to the
Atlantic coast received official recog
nition in a general warning sent out
by the British cruiser Lancaster. A
warship, stationed 15 miles southeast
of Sandy Hook, cautioned all steam
ships flying the flag of the entente
allies to beware of hostile submarine
boats on this side of the Atlantic.
The British wireless read:
"German submarines may be met

unnecessary lights and avoid all trade
routes and converging points."
Not since the U-58 entered New
port harbor on October 7 and on the
following day sank several British
merchant vessels, has there been so
much uneasiness in marine quarters.
It is believed merchant vessels of the
allies now loading here will not ven
ture out until the British government
gives assurances that the seas are
clear and danger is remote.
Incoming vessels took such precau
tions as shrouding lights during dark
ness and having lifeboats swung out.

READY TO SIGN
Border Control Protocol not
to Liking of Constitu
tional Convention.
Carranza Intimates He will
Take His Time to Study
the Document.
Queretaro, Mexico, Nov. 27.—High
Mexican officials here to attend the
constitutional convention are still
awaiting the full text of the border
control protocol signed In Atlantic
City last week and the full text of
Secretary Lane's statement defining
in part the policy of the United States
government towards Mexico before
they will make any comment on
either.
General Carranza told the Associat
ed Press today it was "too early to
discuss Secretary Lane's statement. In
the statement Mr. Lane asserted his
belief that Carranza was a strong
man and should be given a "full
chance to settle Mexican difficulties."
General Carranza also stated he
would not comment on the Atlantic
City protocol until Mexican Commis
sioner Albert J. Pani arrived here
with a copy of the agreement and a
reply had been sent to the United
States.
There is evidence, however, that
the news of tl® protocol and of Sec
retary Lane's statement has been re
ceived by other officials with mixed
feelings. There is seemingly satisfac
tion that an arrangement has been
reached for the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops and control of the border
but this is tempered by the feeling
that Secretary Lane's statement will
require deep consideration. Tho
terms of the protocol mentioning a
delay of forty days before the with
drawal of the troops, if conditions
permit of such action, is adversely
commented on in some quarters
Many influential men had hoped for
the immediate recall of the American
troops.
Oppose Bandit Pursuit.
It is known that certain. leaders
have vigorously opposed any agree
ment that would permit the pursuit of
bandits into Mexico by American
troops. As outlined by Secretary Lane,
it being stated that such pursuit can
only be regarded in the light of an
Invasion. Other influential men, how
ever, have made the declaration that
the signing of the protocol is the be
ginning of an understanding that will
wipe out cause for disagreement be
tween the .two countries.
A credentials revising committee
composed of fifteen members includ
ing six congressmen under the

was appointed at the second session
of the constitutional assembly held

There was considerable debate kver
the political responsibilities of the
renovadores because they had con
