With about 330 members in r.ttead
ance, the Seventeenth Annual State
Conference for Social Welfare is in
session in Columbia. Of these mem
bers Columbia gave 129, just one less
than was given by Marshall to the
'conference last year. Sixty.have reg
istered at the doors, and 132 have
come from various parts of the State.
The visitors have filled the hotels
and many hae been taken into the
home3 cf friends in Columbia. Among
the social workers from over the state
vho have come to take part in the
conference arc large numbers of for
mer students and graduates of the
Unhersity, who received their first
organized ideas of social work from
the teachers of the department of so
ciology. So far, the program has been car
ried out according to schedule, with
one exception. Col. Frederick Gard
ner, governor-elect, did not arrive to
speak at this afternoon's meeting of
the officers of state institutions and
at tonight's session of the conference.
At the dinner hour this evening,
round table discussion will be con
ducted at the Virginia Grill, and at
the Athens Hotel.
The program started yesterday af
ternoon with invocation by the Rev.
Madison A. Hart. President A. Ross
Hill of the University delivered the
address of welcome.
Firt ('(inference In 1901.
President Hill spoke of the organ
ization of the conference in 1901, and
of its second session, held in Colum
bia. It was in the year 1901 that the
department of sociology of the Uni
versity was established, and the work
of this department in connection with
the couference was highly praised by
President Hill. This department in
the University Mr. Hill characterized
as one of the most widely known and
best in any state university in Ameri
ca. "The purpose of the state charity
and eleemosynary institutions," con
tinued President Hill, "is to make the
delinquent classes independent, and to
accomplish this end there is no or
ganization doing more constructive
work than the State Conference for
Social Welfare. He expressed a con
fident belief that this conference will
have a broad influence on the legis
lature." President Hill also mentioned the
work of the School of Social Economy
at St. Louis, as an integral part of the
Univcrsiy.
Wants Politics Disregarded.
The most emphatic part of Presi
dent Hill's address, however, was
probably his appeal for disregard of
all polical allegiance in the state's
social Institutions. He spoke of the
University appointments and the
appointing curators and University of
apolnting curators and University of
ficers with regard to their political
faith. President Hill closed his ad
dress with an exhortation to the use
t publicity, expressing his belief

large'.y a story of the results which
W. N. Wilson of Marshall, PresI-'
dent of the Conference.

Missouri and proposed a number of
laws for those afflicted ones.

TO ACT ONCTTY'S VOTE
St. Louis Circuit Attorney
Plans to Call for Books
of Last Election.
By United Press
ST. LOUIS, Nov. .Reports were
current at the Municipal Court Build
ing today that the circuit attorney is
preparing a petition to one of the crim
inal courts asking for an order to Jo
seph Wright, secretary of the elecUon
board, to produce the registration
books, poll books and tally sheets of
five precincts of the St. Louis election,
November 7.
The order is one of the steps in the
grand jury investigation into charges
and counter-charges concerning irreg
ularities at the polls in each of the
precincts in which negroes were ar
rested after challenge on November 7.
Commissioner Wright said he had not
heard of the contemplated order, but
would produce the records as soon as
the court directed. The reason for the
order comes under a law which pro
hibits, by inference, the production of
tally sheets, save in the case of a
court order in a contested or criminal
proceeding.

guard, was called to his home in Cam

VILLA ATM KEPT OP
Northern Carranzistas Sent
to Relieve Chihuahua City
Juarez Threatened.
By United Press
EL PASO, Nor. 27. That the at
tempted storming of Chihuahua City by
an army of 4,000 Villistas under per
sonal command of Villa was still in
progress early today was the declara
tion of United States department ag
ents here. They based their state
ments on the action of the Mexican de
facto government authorities In send
ing every Carranza soldier available
in Northern Mexico to the relief of the
besieged city. This is the fifth day of
the battle for possession of Chihuahua
City.
In spite of every effort of the de fac
to officers no word of the fate of Gen
eral Trevino and his garrison has
leaked out here since noon Saturday.
That Villa with his forces is still en
circling the" city is certain. In United
States official circles here it was be
lieved today that it was certain Chi
huahua .City was in a stage of siege or
messengers would have brought news.
At the same time it was said that Villa
had not yet captured the city.
United States secret service men
here declare the possibility of an at
tack on Juarez within a few weeks
is looming big. Two deserters from
Salazar's band told government agents
that Salazar announced to his men be
fore the attack on Chihuahua City that
he had been ordered by Villa to come
north after taking the capital and cap
ture Juarez. Fewer than 3,000 men are
garrisoning Juarez at present.
PROF. ANKENEY HAS EXHIBIT
St. Lonls Paper Says Pictures Show
Contract Over Symphony.
Prof. J. S. Ankeney of the art de
partment has a collection of about
one hundred pictures on display at the
Central Public Library in St. Louis
this week.
F. E. A. Curley of the Post-Dispatch
has this to say about Professor An
keney's exhibition: "There is in Pro
fessor Ankeney's pictures a charac
ter which makes them particularly in
teresting. They are fresh from na
ture and done in a spirit of apprecia
Uon and delight They are sincerely
studious, and for the most part are
painted with wide-open eyes, in the
clear, frank light of the sun. This is
to say that bold contrast prevails over
symphony in Ankeney's Interpreta
tions of Missouri landscape. A group
of canvasses painted at Cape Ann last
summer present more delicate tone
and reflect a softer atmosphere. A
crouD of water colors from the New
England coast again shows more of an
effort to formalize color."
COLUMBIA WILL HELP
STATE CELEBRATION
City Is Named by Committee
As One of Four to Aid in
Honoring Centennial.
MAY WRITE HISTORY
St. Louis, Jefferson City and
Kansas City Are Other
Places Named.
Columbia, along with St. Louis,
Kansas City and Jefferson City, has
been decided upon as the cities in
which state-wide celebration of Mis
souri's centennial as a state will be
observed. The decision was made at
the meeting of the Centennial Com
mittee of One Thousand, which was
held under the auspices of the State
Historical Society in Kansas City Sat
urday. Besides the state-wide cele
brations in these places there is to be
a day set aside during the State Fair
in 1929 for a centennial celebration.
The celebration in Columbia will be
in commemoration of the completion of
Missouri's admission, as a state on
August 10, 1821.
Jefferson City will commemorate
sary of the passing of the Missouri
assembly, September 18, 1820.
Kansas City will start the celebra
tions by commemorating the anniver
sary of the pasing of the Missouri
enabling act, March 6, 1820. This first
celebration will probably be held in
March 1920.
St. Louis will be the next in the se
ries, celebrating the centennial of
the adoption of Missouri's first con
stitution and entrance into statehood,
July 19, 1S20.
The report of the committee recom
mends that five volumes of history of
the state be written, these to be dis
tributed to every school, every libra
ry and the officials of the state. This
history Is to embrace the complete an
nals of Missouri, 1541 to 192L i
The celebrations are tobe held in
every county in the state during 1920.
A committee has been appointed in
each county to see that the time, man
ner and place of the county celebra
tions be arranged in advance and a
thorough celebration be held.
CONDITIO OF POOR TAKES UP

another there is no stove. The women
