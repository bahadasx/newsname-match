eiuted Press today it 'u.i 'too enrly"
to discuss the statement given out
Friday by jjocretury of the interior
Ijine nt Alhintir City concerning the
policy of the I'nited States toward

who is chairman of the American
commissioners, .inserted his belief Hint
Carrnuuz was a strong man rind should

Some Against II.
Time is evidence, however, that
news of the protocol and of Secretary
lime's statement has been received
with mixed feeling. There. seemingly
is satisfaction that an arrangement
I.hs been reached for the withdrawn
of the American troops from .l.-xico
and for the control of tho border, hut
thin In tempered by the feeling that
Secretary lime's stateiiient will re
quire deep consideration. The term.:
the protocol mentioning a delay of
forty davs for the withdrawal of the
troops, if oondllions permit of such
action. Is adversely commented on in
romc quarters, as many Influential
men had hoped for the immediate le
ctin of the troops to American t'rii
toi y.
It is known hat certain leaders
have vigornut-Ty opposed any ugrec
incnt 'hat would permit the pursuit
into Mexico of bandits by the Amoil-
can troops, as outlined by Seen turv
Lane, it heinr .dated that such pur
suit can only be regarded In t tie liitht
of an Invasion. ' itlier lnfluentl-.il men,
however have made the declaration
that the signing of the protocol is the
