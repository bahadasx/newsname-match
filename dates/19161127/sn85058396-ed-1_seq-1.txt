hood of Armistice in Europe
Causes General Un
loading. Chicago, Nov. 27. Wheat prices
came down today with a crash, break
ing in some cases aa much as 9 3-S
cents a bushel. Big sales by some of
the leading houses started a general
movement to unload holdings and gave
an opening for aggressive selling by
bears.
Talk of the likelihood of an armis
tice in Europe had considerable to do
with weakening tho market and so
also had warnings of tho presonce of a
fighting submarine In the Atlantic.
Continued reference to a possible em
bargo by tho United States was like
wise a factor.
July wheat, in which tho greatest
decline took place, fell to $1,45 as com
pared with ?1.54 1-8 to $1.54 3-S at tho
finish on Saturday.
In later dealings tho market scored
rallies. The greatest recovery was in
tho last hour and was due to an unex
pected falling off shown In tho United
States visible supply. Prices, how
over, closed at not losses of 3 1-4 to
4 l-4c net a bushel with December at
$1.73 to 1.73 6-8, May $1.80 to 1.S0 1-4,
and July $1.49 7-8 to 1.50.

Overrunning of Rumania

London, Nov. 27, 3: OS a. m. Al
though the commentators in the morn

to disguise tho fact that the position
of the Rumanians has become very
much worse and that they aro sorely
in need of succor, the weightest writ

that the Rumanian soldiers are fight

It Is contended that as long as-this
Is tho case tho Rumanians may yet
turn the tables, as did the allies on
tho Marno in 1914, the sltuatfon then
having many of the general features
of the present position of Rumania.
Confidence is also expressed that re
inforcements from the Rumanian
northern army and the Russians soon
must arrive for tha aid of tho threat
ened armies in the south. The sud
den rise in tho Danube in consequence
of the thaw also is rogarded as a fac
tor which may prove very awkward
for tho Germans.
Some of the comment even ap
proaches optimism, it being contended
that the Germans in their haste to
conquer Rumania have actually weak

sity of drawing men from other
fronts for thq Rumanian campaign.
Th Dally Mail accepts the details of
the Rumanian retreat as true.

sources that Villa had been complete-
ly driven away from Chihuahua City Pl
and was retreating toward the moun- 'fil
Another report in circulation both '1
here and in El Paso stated General
Trevino had sent a courier to Terrazas IH
station with a message announcing a i'll
complete rout of the Villa forces. ilH
This report could not bo confirmed at n
military headquarters. ll
. Judge Martinez added that Villa had
entered the city at different points '!H
during the day, according to a report liH
he received Sunday, but had been re- i
pulsed, the judge said.
Communication with Chihuahua City 1
is expected to be resumed late today, ill
according to General Francisco Gon- J
zales. A message was received irom
the station agent at Terrazas station.
23 miles north of Chihuahua, saying a I IH
repair train was expected to reach
there at noon from the direction of 1
the state capital. The smoke of the JH
work train locomotive could bo seen
near Corral, the Terrazas agent said IH
over the wire. General Gonzales or- 'IH
dered the agent to ascertain the condi- ''1
tions in Chihuahua City from the train '
crew as soon as it reached Terrazas ,
and to report to him here.
Tho Carranza staff officers believe
now that Villa has been driven from
the northern part of the state. They
base their belief upon the fact the
work train which had reported its
progress by telegraph, was able to IH
leave Chihuahua City. The railroad
enters tho capital from tho north and 'H
had there been any bandits in the zono
to thp north'dr -northeast of the city, !H

had "gone over," a big odds and mak- 'j
ing him a handsome return on his j
investment His friend persuaded
him to slip out the back way to
escape publicity. The two went to
Omaha, where he was deserted. ' jl
Another man asked a local bank for jH
a draft on his home bank, telling the 'lll
clerk he was going to "clean up" on a

informed him of the situation he was jH
in and on his advice the man took
a detective when he went to meet tho H
friend who had given him tho confi- iH

a Colorado farmer, was saved about rl
$5,000. 'H
