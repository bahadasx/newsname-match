His Scheme to Go Be

By STEVENSON H. EVANS
Wheeling, W. Va , Nov. 26. "If
thmgs go much further at ( harleston,
I. for one, am prepared to be part of
an armed force to go down there and
let the Governor ar.d his gang under

over the rights of the people of Wc^t
Virginia.
"I am not for lynch law or for an

There come? a tim* when physical
force is all that men can depend on. If
that time has come in this state, let us
BM force. and BM i*. quick."
These words are not the irresponsible
ramblings of a nobody. They were
spoken quietly to me thi' evening by
one of the most substantial lawyers in
the biggest city of West Virginia. He
sat in the lounge of the Fort Henry
Club here, discusslng without rxcite
ment the situation vhich has been de
veloping since Governor Hatfi?ld sum
moned the Legislature to curtail the
powers of the incoming Democratic
Governor.
Pynamlte ln Situation
There ia real dyntmite in the present
amaring political condition of West
Virginia. The people of the sUte.
among whom (Republican offieeholders
exceptedi there is little gratitude for
Goyernor Hatfield's eleventh hour at
tempt to curtail the Czar-lik* powers
of his office. will feei more. at *ase
when the special tesstor. of the fast
dying Legislature adjourns. hut they
will not feel secure untn the Governor
elert. John J. Cornweii. assumes office
on March 4.
It is rignificanv cf th* low plan* on
which West Virglnians talk. think and
play politics that among those most
deeply interested only two rnotives are
a?rribed to the Governor for his latest
attempt to make the Leglaletflra creato
a commission to investigate all charges
of corrupt practices at the . ecent elec
tion, the members of the commission to
be named by himselt. These rnotives
are:
To raid the state trvasury and make
fat jobs for outgoing offieeholders.
To prevent the iriauguration of Gov
ernor-elect Cornweii.
Would Go Behind Returns
The lntest paeaaagfl of tha Governor
reached the T.rgislattire when if was
nearly ready to adjoarn, *rcnrding to
the independent Republicans, who had
agreed to stand for the eemaarativalv
moderat* nrogramme of "reforfll" laid
rinvrn in '(if Governor's first message,
they were assured that the plan to take
from th* Governor all power of ap
pointment had been abatidoned and
that nothing further would ba at
tCBipted. Now comes the effort tr. clot he
n Governor's commission with sweeping
inquisitorial pnwers to go behind the
face af rotaraa which gave the state to
tne Democratic eandidaU for Governor
by more than .r.,000.
The present Legislature of West Vir?
ginia will cease to exist at midnight
Thanksgiving Pay. Whatever else it
does at the request of its mounlaineer
Governor. Henry D. Hatfield, mu?* he
done in four dsyf. The probabilities
ar* that the Fpeeial sesr.ion, which al
rei.dv haa sent to the dovernor sweep?
ing laws eurtailing the power of the
i ? ef Execfltive, will tcrminntc to-mor?
row night.
Nlne Republicans Boll
Hurried ad;ournment last night came
after two efforts to Baacaa the Repub
lican Senators in favor of the commis
Bion to inveatlgate election frauds. Of
the thirty Senators, nir.eteen are Re?
publicans. Nine declined to sUnd for
the resolution, declaring openly that it
was merely the first step Ifl a schem*

Obser.ers are at a loss to account
for the Governor's message of Friday
reciting various charges of gross elec
tmn frauds and demanding the iavooti
gating hody. They say that the Gov
ernor is too good a politician to at?
tempt aomething he cannot put over.
Therefore they are fearful lest the
Hatfield machine has a card or two left
to play.

Ships which arrived in New York
harbor yesterday reported picking up
the cry against the undersea foe, while
still at sea. At 9 last night thc cruiser
Lancaster, which patrols off New York
Harbor, added the voice of its wirele.-s
to the general alarm.
What stirred the warship into action
is not l-nown. It Ifl thought that while
watching over the interned lierman
liners. she had either seen a hostile
C-boat or had received definite news
of their prescnce.
Whatever the cause, her acrials

steamers flying the flags of the Fn?
tente to get out of the regular sea
lanes and stay out, to show no lights
exoept when necessarv and to keep a
shaip look-out for tiorman subniarines.
While the Kroonland was driving in
toward New Vork yesterday she re?
ceived a similar warning. laptain Bar
man immediately increased speed and
kept a vigilant look-out until his craft
entered New York Harbor.
The American liner Fhiladelphia
must also have been apprised of the
nearness of the German subniarines.

Report of U-Boats on Way
Here Stirs Washington
[ftOOt Iha Trihun* Btirean ]
Washington, Nov. 26. Renewed anxi
ety orer the submarine situation was
caused to-day bv the cirvumstantial
reports that two l'-boats were headed
for another raid on the American coast.
The reports tended to confirm the fear
among Administration officials that the
I'-'i.l enisode was only a prelude to
more extensive operations in these wa
ters.
Officials repeated to-day that the
Cnited Statea could not tolerate sub?
marine warfare in the lanea of Ameri?
can commerce. If there is to be any
attempt to blockade the American
coast, even if conducted according to
the strict law of visit and search, the
vital interevt of the I'nited Stat?>s will

Blow at World's Tonnage
If the (i"rman intention were only to
attack tranaports and other war craft
f'no Unitad States could not complain,
it i? declared. But officials believe the
main object of the submarine warfare
ia to reduce the world's tonnage, and
thus hamper the Allies in getting sup
plies. On no other understanding can
they explain the wholesale deatruction
of neutral ships and the refusal of sub?
marine commanders to be content with
jM'isoning contraband.
The lanes of commerce off the Ameri?
can coast, it ia admitted, offer aplendid
opportunities for raids of this sort.
Becauae of their wide cxtent and their
distance from British ba?es the sub?
marine destroying methods used ef
fectively in the Kuropean naval war
gone cannot be employed. It is un- ;

and Wircless to Sayv'lle.?
At a luncheon General von
Falkenhayn gave to-day to
neutral correspondents he re
marked that. although "noth?
ing in this worfd is so certain
that one dares predict any
thing with safety." Bucharest
will be uncomfortable to be
in when the Gennans get
their guns trained on it.
General von Falkenhayn
declmed to commit himself as
to when this might occur.
and even questioned the
purely military advantage of
possession of Bucharest, with
its thousands to feed. when
the same result might be ac
complished by gradually
decimating the Rumanian
army. But he left not the
slightest doubt in the minds
of his hearers that he consid
ered it a possibility of th; im
mediate future.

'.Bj Cab'a ?* Tha Trlbuna:
London, Nov. 26. ? Mackensen and
Falkenhayn havo joined forces and
are now driving together on Bu
charest. At one point only forty
scven miles separate the invader?
from their goal. The Rumani?n*
are hastily falling back toward the
capital. burning and laying wast?
the villages and plains in the path
of the enemy.
Mackensen's entire army of inva
sion has crossed tho Danube. despite
its flooded condition. and is moving
swiftly on Bucharest. Leaving hi?
Dcbrudjan units in charge of aub
ordinates, the German field marahal
porsonally supervised the transfer at
his forces to Rumar.ian soil and ta
now leading them in the march on
Ferdinand's seat of government.
Bucharest by Week Knd
Meanwhile, Falkenhayn's northern
army continues its swi?ep down the
Alt Valley. steadily approarhing the
point where it, too, will be able to
join hands with the units on the
Wallachian plain and jrreatly rein
force thc horde against which Bu?
charest will be compelled to fight.
Two towns?Ramnicu and Valcea?
thirty-five miles south of the fron
tier, fell before the Teutons to-day.
At the rate the Germanic troopa aro
moving it aoema probable that they
will be hammering at the pates of
Bucharest by the end of this week.
The junction of the forces of the two
German commanders was formed a*
some point between the Alt and V'edea
rivers, south of the Craiova-Slatina
railroad. Berlin is not explicit on this
point, but it appeara almost certam
that it was the co'.umn moving up tha
Alt from its conflucr.ee with the Dan?
ube that f.r?t came in touch with tha
troops of Faikenhayn advannng ea'i
ward from the left bank of the Alt
Bucharest atatea to-day that the Bu
manian troop- elashed with the eneinv
near Roshiori-de-Vedo. This indicates
that Falkenhayn's anny has reached a
point some twenty milca eaat of the
lower Alt. It indicates, also. that Ale\
andria, an important city on the \ 11
Kiver and the Z;mnicea railroad, i"
surrounded and doomed to capture any
hour.
