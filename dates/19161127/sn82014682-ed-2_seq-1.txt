vice in Honolulu, today include the fol
lowing: 1. At 3 o'clock this morning, under
orders .from . Sheriff Rose, Deputy
Sheriff Asch and Capt of Detectives
McDuffle led a big squad of detectives
and patrolmen to Iwilel and raided the
. resort,
2. Thirteen; men were arrested
charged by the police with attending
a place used for the purposes of com
mercial vice. In plainer language, the
police charge these . men with being
"pimps" and panderers.
3. They were arraigned in police
court at 10 o'clock, after a consul ta
tion between Police Judge Monsarrat,
Capt. McDuffle and Deputy City Attor
ney Chllllngworth " and . formally
charged. ! .Then- Chillingworth asked
the court -to continue the casts untlll
'Wednesday, setting ball meanwhile at
$250 each. ,The judge complied with
the request.
"V 4 The r. -t?rrltora grand '. jury,
which has been investigating condi
tions at Iwilel and commercial vice in
Honolulu for several weeks, was called

.6. Rev. C H. McVey, pastor of the
Kalihi Union' church, who succeeded
In getting a conviction of a woman

personally knows concerning vice out
side Iwilel.
7. A special meeting of the board
of directors of the chamber of com-
merce has been called for Wednesday
to consider the vice situation.
8. u. S. Marshal Smiddy appeared
at the police court hearing of the men
taken at Iwilel, to see if any evidence
is brought out warranting prosecution
(under the federal law. Such prosecu
tion would prohaby be under the Ed

early hours of this morning when
more than a dozen of its naDitues
men alleeed by the police to be those
tr. Vh Hv off the earaimrs of

vice were trapped in a sudden and
spectacular raid of Iwilel by the Hc
nolulu police.
The raid was made . between 3 and

the fact that the police had acted with
unlooked-for suddenness.
The' following Is a detailed list of

Delegate Kuhiov Conors With
Party Leaders on National
- - Legislation ' ' ;
Revision of the present laws regulat
ing homesteading in Hawaii is to be
taken up at Washington this winter
by Delegate Kuhio.
' Following out the pledge of the Re
publican party in its territorial plat
form, leaders of the G. O. P. are work
Ing out a plan to present In the form
of a congressional bill. A conference
and luncheon was held today between
the delegate, R. W. Breckons, national
committeeman, II. L. Holsteln, the
" war-horse" from Kohala, and A. D.
Castro, who wrote the homesteading
plank included in the platform adopt
ed last summer.
The plank includes the following
features, which will be observed in
j shaping proposed legislation:
We pledge our delegate In Congress
to endeavor to secure proper legisla
tion permitting the legislature to
enact laws similar to the acts of Con
gress under which Irrigation works to
be used In the reclamation of arid
land are constructed by the govern
ment. '. .
"We also pledge our delegate in Con
gress to endeavor to secure an exten
sion of the laws relating to pastoral
lands so that it will be possible to
subdivide pastoral lands into ' small
areas of not more than 200 acres for
I purpose of promoting ranches under
'citizen ownersnip unaer tne present
system wealthy corporations and in
dividuals are permitted to lease from
the government large tracts of land
and thus prevent the individual . citi
zen of moderate means from compet
ing in the leasing of such lands. By
this method the consistent monopoly
of the products of such land by a few
corporations is being permitted, con
trary to Republican principles of in
dustrial opport unities."

MAIL ORDER CO.
Offer of Petticoat for Five Let
ters and One Dime Barred
rom the Mails
V If any one has received from the
mainland a letter promising you a
$4.75 silk petticoat if you will Bend 10
cents to the National- Mall Order
Brokerage Company , of 520 Globe
building, Minneapolis, it Is best; not
to 8 end the dime.
At least one woman in Honolulu
has received such a letter and perhaps
more have had them. However, if any
answers are mailed, here to the con
cern they will be returned by the Ho
nolulu, poaXofflce -. to the 'senders of
w.iH,b. forwarded to. the dead letter
bureau. .' '
An official fraud order - from the
postofflce department telling of the
swindle has been received by Acting
Postmaster; William C. Petersen from
Acting . Postmaster General J. C.
Koons. The order directing all post
masters to bar from the malls all let
ters addressed to the swindlers is sup
plemented by a notice from the post
office department's solicitor, W. H.
Lamar, dated October 30, describing
the methods of operation.
"All postmasters are directed r to
withdraw from the mails all mall mat
ter of any kind addressed to this con
cern," says the order, "and return to
the sender where known, or send to
the dead letter office if unknown."
According to Solicitor Lamar's post
script, the scheme is worked as fot
lows: : ,v
"A silk petticoat worth $4.75 is prom
ised the addressee provided she will
remit 10 cents to the concern ' and
send five exact copies of the letter
received by her to five of her acquaint
ances." The postal authorities discov
ered the swindle and stopped it by is
suing a fraud order, acting on the
grounds that the concern obtained
money under false pretenses!
. A despatch from Washington to the
Herald-Republican of Salt Lake City,
dated November 11, says that as a re
sult of this action taken by the post
offlce department postmasters through
out the country have sent to the dead
letter office 70,000 letters, containing
a similar number of dimes, sent by
trusting women to the concern which
promised to deliver a $4.75 petticoat
"1917 model," for 10 cents. Of the
500,000 letters which continued to pour
into the Minneapolis postoffice some 60
per cent were returned to the senders.
The rest went to the dead letter office.

OF LABORERS IS
Alarming Hilo Report Appears
Not to Be Borne Out By
Facts Adduced
There Is no unprecedented exodus of
plantation laborers indicated by the
bookings of the steamship companies
here either to Japan or to the main
land following tne payment of bonuses
to the laborers of the various sugar
companies. Some increase in the num
ber of Filipinos booking for passage
to the mainland, is found but that in
crease s not alarming. ,
Advices from Hilo under date of
November 22 said that the bonus sys
tem was' not working as had been ex
pected and that with the final pay
ments ifborers were leaving in droves
and a shortag3 of labor wtos threat
ened. The report continued that it
was said nnbff Iclally a new method of
bonus payments "would be arranged by
the plantations s ; ' yt ';v V
Investigations here do not bear out
the alarming view of the labor-situation
sent here from Hilo. A. W. T.
Bottomley, president 'of the planters'
association, said this morning that he
considered any criticism of bonus pay
meuts at this time premature; that
time ahould be given to see how it
would work out. Then If changes be
necessary they can be made but
thus far there was nothing to Indicate
that the plan was the failure which
the Hilo despatches indicated. That
laborers would leave the plantations
and take a trip after receiving the
bonuses paid them he considered quite
natural. They would want to make
purchases and to enjoy ' themselves,
but he thought the majority would be
found back on : the plantations when
work demanded them there.

. (laaociatfi Prt Sr?tr by rdrU WlnlMa)
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 27. The British foreign office hat sent a note to
U. S. Ambassador Page refusing to grant the request from the United
States for safe conduct for Count Adam Tarnowski von Tarnow. the new
Austro-Hungarian ambassador to the United States. Count von Tarnow is

been made public for Britain's attitude.
In giving its reasons for. refusing safe conduct for von Tarnow, the
British government declares a policy of preventing diplomats of the Central
Powers from traveling to and from the United States. v
Summarized, Britain's stand is given as follows: "Even if international
law forbade the refusal of auch safe conducts, the actions of the Austrian
and German embassies and consulates abroad have been so much in excess
of their regular diplomatic functions that the British government feels jus
tified in withholding consent for such diplomats to travel to their posts.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Nov. 27- Six steamships which arrived here today
