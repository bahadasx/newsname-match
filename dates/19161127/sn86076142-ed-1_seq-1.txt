WAGES
50 CENTS SHiFi
The mine workers who responded
to the shrill shrieking ot the seven
o'clock whistles this morning did so
with greater alacrity. , There was a
quickness about their movements and
more cheerfulness than had been
manifested since the pressure of high
living cost began to make Inroads on
the savings of . the industriously in
clined. The fact that the Tonopah
Mine Operators' association had
agreed to advance wages fifty cents a
shift for all classes of employes was
the reason for the bettor spirit shown
as the men got ready to go down the
hole. For some time there has been
talk of asking the mine operators for
more money to offset the increases
demanded by grocers, bakers and
butchers, but this sentiment never
took the shape of a formal demand.
Last week two shifts employed on the
Victor shaft quit work because they
said they thought they were entitled
to more than $5.00 a shift. There
was no strike and there was no
trouble. The men simply left It to
the management. The carpenters
and machinists, however, made repre
sentations some time ago to the
effect that members of their crafts
were getting more money In other
places and action was left with the
operators. :
The mine operators have had the
matter under advisement for some
time and the events of last week
brought a decision . late Saturday
afternoon to the effect that after the
first of December, and while silver
remains at 70 cents an ounce or
better, wages would be advanced fifty
cents a shift for all classes of wage
earners employed by the mining com
panies. This makes the minimum of
the Tonopah district $4.50 for eight
hours and raises the machinists from
$5.50 to $6.00 a shift. The botice
posted at every Bhaft in the district
yesterday reads as follows: '
