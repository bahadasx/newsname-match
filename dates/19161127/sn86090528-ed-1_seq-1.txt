SUCCESSFUL
CONVENTION
"I have attended eleven Y. W. C. A.
conventions," declared Miss Gilbert
at the O. C. W. this morning, "but the
one which concluded its labors yester
day was the most successful one in
which I have ever participated."
The delegates have all departed
but the work which was accomplished
by the annual meeting of the south
west department at Chickasha will
long be remembered. Both officers
and delegates left with a feeling of
deep appreciation for their reception
both by Professor Austin and the fac
ulty and student body at tho college
and for the people of Chickasha who
made their stay a nfost pleasant one.
Among the. features of the conven
tion was the se.-fjs of lectures deliv
ered by Professor Frank Seay at the
college. On Sunday morning relig
ious services were held and the audi
torium was packed and the upper gal
lery filled, the congregation being
drawn from many of the city church
es as well as from the student body.
ROSIE CHANGES HER MIND
Rosie Williams, a negress who was
fined $5 for fighting by Judge Hayes
in police court this morning, changed
her mind in a hurry about preferring
to "lay her terra out in jail" when Ser
geant Looney enlightened her upon
what such a course meant.
Rosie, it 6,eems, had some funds
tucked safely away in the keeping of
a friend. On being taken back to her
cell after her trial Rosie sent word to
; friend to take her money and
take care of it. "I'se goin' tuh lay it
out in jail," she added confidently.
J. few minutes later Bob Looney
called her out and presented her with
a well filled bucket of water and a
new mop. Then he instructed her in
the uso of those inplements about a
city jail.
'What you bring me dem fur?" she
Inquired with a look of scorn.
"Ah ain't goin' to do no scrubbin'."
"All right," said the desk sargeant.
'You can lay it out in jail and you
don't have to work but while you are
here yon. get two slices of bread and
a tincup from the hydrant three times
a day."
A few moments later tho Attention
of the desk sergeant was attracted by
a loud pounding on the jail door.
"What's the matter in there," he in
quired on opening the little iron w in-
low and observing the face of Ro ,-:e
pressed through the bars.
"Ah wants to get to de telephonic
I wants to get to de telaphome
quick," she exclaimed.
"What do you want at the tele
phone," ssked the officer.
"Ah wants ter telaphome for money
to pay me out."
"But didn't you tell me you wanted
to lay it out?"
"Ah dun change mah mind," was the
mournful reply. "Ah wants ter get to
der telaphome."
But the sergeant, thinking that per
haps she may want to change her
mind again, left her in suspense as to
the final disposition of her call.
