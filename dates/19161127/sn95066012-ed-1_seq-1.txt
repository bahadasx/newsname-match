SUNDAY
CONVERTS
f SMHHM PETER
Nearly 4,000 "Hit fawdust Trail"
During Three Services
THOUSANDS FIND NO SEATS
Tabernacle Filled Two and One-Half
Hours Before Evening Service
Began.
Boston, Nov. 2G. Today was the
greatest day in the" history of Dilly
Sunday revivals. Just 3702 people
"hit the sawdust trail" at the three
meetings, eclipsing the number of con
verts In the biblical account of Peter
at Pentecost, when 3000 were convert
ed in a day. At both the afternoon
and evening services the baseball
evengelist preached his sermon on
"Chickens come home to roost," which
Is considered one of his greatest ser
mons. Hours before the time of service the
large auditorium was filled with thous
ands of eager people, and many thous
ands were unable to get In. This af
ternoon's meeting was for men only,
and Just 1235 men hit tho trail after
the sermon. "Get right with God,"
was was the subject of this morning's
sermon, in which Billy urged all to
lose no time In accepting the teach
ings of the Bible.
Every seat in the immense taber
nacle was taken tonight at 6 o'clock.
Just 2 1-2 hours before the time of the
service. The baseball evangelist was '
very active during his evening ser
mon. He told his audience that ho
was American to the core;. "My fore- j
iamers uiea m me war or ine ttevoiu
tion and my father died in the south
land during the civil war. I am an
American, don't you forget that.
When every man becomes a law to
ihlmself, every star will fall from the ,
not Tlia V,1 un.l .. 111 itiocnlvn !

into red and the red flag of anarchy
will fly In its stead. We will swim
in rivers of blood before we allow
that. If you wave a red flag, then to
hell with you. 1 say."
Mr. Sunday's tCTct was the 104th
Psalm, the 35th verse: "Let the sin
ner be consumed out of the earth and
let the wicked be no more."
This always seemed to me to bo a
queer verse of scripture. It is a verse
more often misunderstood than any
other and read by many to justify
their living In sin. It contains a
thought which I don't find so well ex
pressed in any other verso, not on
account of Its peculiarity but because
it is used by men to justify their liv
ing in sip.
I sometimes find people who talk
lightly of sin. If only the men who
sin were affected by thtir sins, it
would be hard enough.
When you come staggering home,
cussing right and left and spewing and
spitting, your wife suffers, your chll
dreu suffer. Don't think that you are
the only one that suffers. A man that
goes to the penlntentiary makes his
wife and children suffer Just as much
as he does. You're placing a stain
on your wife and your children. If
you're a dirty, low-down, filthy,
drunken, whisky-soaked bum, you'll
affect ell with whom yen come in
contact. If you're a God fearing man
you will influence all with whom you
come in contact. You can't live by
yourself.
You say you're not afraid of sin.
You ought to be for your children. It
doesn't take boys long to get on the
wrong track, and while you are
scratching gravt-1 to make one lap
your boy makes 10. We've got kids
who have not yet sprouted long
breeches who know more about sin
and vice than Methusolah.
Thero are little frizzled top aisles
not yet sprouting long dresses who
know more about vice than did their
grayjhaird grandmothers. Tho girl
who drinks will abandon her virtue.
What did Methuselah know about
smoking cigarets?
If anyone over tells you that you
can't be virtuous and enjoy good
health I brand him as a low, Infa
mous, black-hearted liar. Why they'll
bo telling you your daughter can't
bo healthy and be virtuous before
long and want you to let some one
keep her on the side just like you're
keoping that woman.
Ask any afflicted man you see on the
street. If you could only reveal tho
heart of every one of them! In most
you would find despair and disease.
How little he thinks when he is
nursing that lust that he is nursing a
demon which, like a vampire, will
suck his blood and wreck his life and
blacken and blight his existence. And
If any little children are born to him
they will be weak anemlcs without
the proper blood in their veins to sup
port them.
Young men, shrink from that vice
as you would a viper. Our young
men ought to be taught that no sum
they can leave to a charitable institu
tion can blot out the deed of an ig
nominious life.

HOME TALENT PROGRAM
Pleased the Ladles of the Fortnightly
Saturday Afternoon
"One of the most interesting meet
ings we ever had" seemed to be the
universal comment on the Fortnightly
meeting of Saturday. This was the
first home afternoon of the year end
the high quality of tho papers read
and the new points of view presented
revived the old tradition of the ex
ceptional talent always to be found
among the club membership.
Miss Maude Carpenter in her paper
which was ably read by Mrs. W. H.
Wills showed how changes in ways of
living had taken away from children
the old ways of practical learning and
how now training of the eye, hand and
ear was being made part of our school
system. She made a special plea for
interest on the part of the parents.
Her theme was admirably supplement
ed by the recitation of "A Stupid
Boy's Lament" by Miss Frances Hol
den. Miss Eleanor Sibley's paper was
most Interesting and practical in Its
suggestions. She spoke of the forma
tion of character through reading and
gave suggestions showing how it was
possible to guide children to the best.
Miss Vossler's paper on "Education
Through Play"- was snappy yet prac
tical and straightforward. She spoke
of the historical theories and then the
modern ones which has lead play to
become part of the modern school cur
riculutus, namely that through play
tho instincts find exercise and are
trained. She illustrated her theories
by a demonstration of actual work be
ing done in her school gymnasium
classes. The demonstration was
marked by a spontaneity and excel
lence quite unusual. Those taking
part were, Rhoda Southall, Marlon
Glisbee, Mildred Miller, Belle Ray
Olga Kelson, Victoria St Mary, Mary
Donnely, Valda Lyons, Marlon Wil
liams. Elisabet Cutler, Cecilc Jack
son. Frances Holdcn. Margaret Rock
wood and Miriam Shakshobtr.
The gymnasium drill was followed
by a Dutch dance done in costume by
a group of High school girls. This
envoked much applause and after ad
journment it was repeated by request.
Those taking part were Eleanor Hut
ton, Anastacia Fitzgerald, Alice
Brown, Barbara Robinson, Sue Hunt
ington. Frances Carver. Dorothy
Patchin and Helen Thomas.
The enjoyment of the afternoon was
greatly augmented by music by the
High School Glee Club and a duet by
Miss Elsa Wahlquist and Helen Car
penter under the able direction of Miss
KInne.
The afternoon was In charge of tho
Education committee.
THE PIERCES
Dramatic Artist Entertainment Tues
day Evening in North Bennington
Bank hall, North Bennington. Tues
day evening. Nov. 28th, The Pierces,
dramtic artists. This is the second
number of the entertainment course
under the auspices of the IVUage Im
provement socloty of North Benning
ton. The Pierces are artists of a high
order and this will, without doubt,
bo the best entertainment of this or
der that has been in North Benning
ton. Don't miss it, you will regret
it If you do. The ten o'clock trolley
both for Bennington and Hooslck
Falls, will be held until close of enter
tainment. Single admission, adults
35o children under high school age

Course tickets for tho four numbers
cau be purchased at tho door Tuesday
evening for 11.00. It is hoped that a
number will avail themselves of this
opportunity as tho sale of course tic
kets this season Is quito a little under
that for previous years.
These entertainments are held for
the benefit of the community, any sur
plus one year being put into next sea
son's course. In this way the Village
Improvement society has been able,
with the co-operation tf the communi
ty, to give a course of a higher order
each year. 4Ut2
but would be disgusted if his wife
or slBter would cuss and hit the booze
llko he does. If she would put 15 or
20 bears under her belt he'd go
whining around a divorce court for
a divorce right away and say ho
couldn't live with her. Why, you
dirty dog, she has to live with you.
God is still on the throne, gentlemen
and he has said:
"Tho sins of tho fathers shall bo
visited upon tho third and fourth gen
erations of them that are evil."
Down to tho third and fourth.
Thero Is no fifth, for the fourth will
be a lunatic and a lunatic born that
way, either male or female, is sterile.
If they could bear children tho off
spring would bo idiots, so you see how
God protects you.
I never used to know when I was
a kid what they meant when they
said"ChIcken come home to roose,"
but I know now. It means If you are
a drunkard your children will bo
drunkards; if you are a libertine, your
children will bo libertines.' In other
words, your children will -return to
disgrace or bless you.
O men, blood will tell. I'm plead
ing with you that you yield to Christ
so that your children's lives will not
be blighted.

MISS BESSIE L. BICKFORD
Former Chief Operator at Bennington
Exchange Dies Suddenly in Pittsfield
Miss Bessie L. Bickford, who was
for six years the chief operator at the
Bennington exchange of the New Eng
land Telephone company, died in
Pittsfield at 1.40 this morning. She
was about 40 years Of age and had
been in the employ of the company for
all of two decades.
Miss Bickford had not been in the
best of health for several years, but
there had recently been no apparent
change for the worse in her condition.
Sunday afternoon while walking on
a Pittsfield street with one of the
young women operators attached to
the exchange in that city, she sudden
ly complained of feeling numb and
fell to the ground unconscious. She
was hurried to the HUlcrest hospital
but did not rally and passed away
early this morning.
Ten years ago Miss Bickford, who
was a native of Brandon, came to Ben
nington from Keene, N. H., to take
the position of chief operator at the
local exchange. She possessed un
usual ability which added to her long
experience enabled her to perform the
duties to the satisfaction of the com
pany and with credit to herself. By
the operators who worked with her
she was held in high esteem and no
later ago than Saturday night she
iliad made arrangements for a week
end visit here In the near future.
Leaving Bennington four years ago.
Miss Bickford became assistant to the
traffic chief in Pittsfield. Her health
failed, however, and after an extended
vacation of which she passed a larger
portion in this village, she returned to
Pittsfield to become matron of the
rest room. The latter position she
held at the time of her death.
So far as la known hero, her only
surviving relatives are two married
sisters living at Brandon and In
Springfield, Mass. The funeral ar
rangements are not known here but
it Is probable that the remains will be
taken to Brondon.

Mark Twoin's Propnetio Wish,
Astronomy was one of Mark Twain's
favorite subjects. Neither of us had
any real knowledge cf the matter,
which made its great facts all the
more thrilling. The thought that tho
nearest fixed star vvns 2r,000,000.000,
Duo miles away one-fourth million
times the distance to our own remote
sun-gave him a sort ofplehtTTa thrill.
He would figure out those great meas
urements of space, covering sheets of
paper with liis sums, but te was not a
good mathematician, nnd the answers
were generally wroug. Comets In par
ticular Interested him, and one day ho
said:
"I carao in with Halley's comet in
IS'55. It Is coming again next year,
and I expect to go out with it. It will
bo the greatest disappointment of my
life if I don't go out with Halley's
comet."
He looked so stron? nnd, full of, color
and vitality one could not believe that
his words held a prophecy. "The Boys'
Life of Mark Twain," by Albert Blge
low raine, in St. Nicholas.
Ich Oien or Eich Dyn.
Which Is accurate as tho motto of
the Prince of Wales Ich Pien or Eich
Dyn? The one Is German and the oth
er Welsh. The one means "I serve,"
the other "Behold the man'' or "Be
hold your man."
"Ich Dlen" was the motto of John,
king of Bohemia, whom the Black
Prince slew at Crccy. "Elch Dyn" are
the words supposed to have beeu uaed
by Edward I. when presenting his in
funt son to the Welsh assembly at
Carnarvon.
Welsh tradition has adhered natural
ly to the Welsh form. The other lias
been more popularly accepted. Lon

Quinino Not a Preventive.
Dr. E. Hal.'ord Boss in a letter to the
London Lancet ridicules the attempt t
prevent malaria by administering qui
nine. This cures malaria, but dot?s not
prevent it, just ns diphtheria Is cured

cites the utter failure of five years of
quinine administration to prevent ma

duction in the disease that immediately
followed the enforcement of autl-moji-quito
measures.

you think a change to a wurmer cli
mate would do nie good?"
"Heavens, man," replied the doctor,

Fleeing Rumanians Burning Towns on
Wallachian Plain East of Alt
River.
Berlin, Nov. 27. Alexandria, 47
miles southwest of Bucharest, has
been captured by the forces of Gen.
Mackensen and Falkenhayne, the war
office announced today.
London, Nov. 27. Bucharest, the
capital of Rumania, with the armies of
the Teutonic allies advancing toward
It both from the west and southwest,
apparently is in peril. Field Marshal
van Mackensen's troops have crossed
tho Danube from Bulgarian territory
to Zlmnltza and are In touch near
Alexandria, 47 miles southwest of Bu
charest, with the forces of Gen von
Falkenhayn's army from Craiova. All
along the front on the Wallachian
plains, east of the Alt river, the Ru
manians are In flight, burning towns
behind them, says Berlin.
To the north, on the hlghts of Cur
tea Dearges, In the region of Dragos
lavele, northeast of Canipulung, and
in western Moldavia near Oiuz, the
Rumanians are offering strong resis
tance to the southward advance of the
Teutons. On all these sectors at
tempts by the Austro-Germans to ad
vance have been held back by the Ru
manians. As yet there has been no Indication
of the arrival of Russian reinforce
ments to aid tho Rumanians on the
Wallachian plains, but the Russo-Ru-imanians
in Dobrudja are active, pos
sibly in an endeavor to push back the
invaders to the Tchernavoda Constan
za railway liue. Sofia reports that this
reinforced army intended a general at
tack along the entire front, but has
been compelled to confine ; itself to
partial attacks.
In the Macedonian theater, bad
weather prevails and there has been
no artillery action except on the left
wing of the entente allied lines near
the Monastir-Prtsba lake road, where,
according to Paris, the French have
made some gains. Sofia denies a re
cent French report that the French
had captured the town of Dobromir,
Baying the Bulgarians are fully in con
trol there.
The French front also is experienc
ing another spell of quietness, and
except for small fights at various
points little activity is displayed by
elUur side.
There has been considerable artill
ery firing along the eastern front near
the Riga regions, with the Germans
the aggressors, and also on the Aus-tro-Italian
front, with the Austrlans
on the initiative.

PASTORATE OF 11
YEARSCLOSED BY
Resignation to Take Tffecilast
unday is December
HAS BEEN h POOR HEUTH
Will Continue to Live at Old Benning
ton but May Temporarily Re
side In Elmira.
Becouse of ill health. Rev. Isaac
Jennings, D. D., has submitted his
j resignation as pastor of the Old First
congregational; cnurcn ai uiu Ben
nington to take effect the last Sunday
In December. Dr. Jennings plans to
make bis home at Old Bennington In
the future, although he may tem
porarily reside in Elmira, N. Y., where
he passed the large portion of his
career in the ministry. For a number
of years he has been afflicted with
rheumatism and recently the malady
has reached a stage which, in the
opinion of his family and friends,
made it Imperative that he give up
the responsibility of the parish.
Dr. Jennings came to Bennington to
! assume the pastorate of the Old First
church 11 years ago. For a quarter of
a century he had been the pastor of
the Presbyterian church in Elmira
which had come Into considerable
prominence through the pastorate of
his predecessor, Rev, Dr. Knox. At
the time he severed his connection
with the Elmira parish, it was 'Dr.
Jennings' intention to retire perma
nently from the ministry. He was,
however, induced to locate at Old
Bennington, the home of his boy
hood, and to take the pulpit which his
father had continuously occupied for
34 years.
During the period that Dr. Jennings
has been pastor of the Old First
church he has been prominently Iden
tified with numerous - activities that
have had for their object the moral
uplift of the community. He has
been keenly interested In the work of
the Bennington Battle Monument and
Historical society and has been a
regular attendant at all of its meet
ings. '
Like his father he had delved deep
ly into the early history of the Old
First church and of the pioneer
period of Bennington and his store
of knowledge ha3 enabled him to pro
I duce for time to time articles which
have been doubly valunble because of
the accurate data contained and for
their literary merit.
It Is seldom the privilege of a
church in Vermont, or elsewhere for
that matter, to secure the services
of such a pastor as Dr. Jennings. Dur
ing his long service In the ministry he
has demonstrated that he Is not only
a preacher of exceptional ability, a
pastor and a student but that he Is
likewise a citizen in all that the word
Impl'es. The news of his resignation
will be received with sincere regret
' not only by the members of the par
ish but In the community at large In
which his personality has been a fac
tor for good during more than a de
cade. GLEE CLUB FOR BENNINGTON
