MAY YET BE SAVED
London, Nov. 27. News from Ger-
man sources caused a renewal of hope
nere loaay (hat Roumanla, after all,
may extnrate herself from the nr..
carious position In which her Walla
chlan forces have been placed iy
General von Kalkenhayn's concededly
brilliant strategic compalgn.
Of prime basis for this hoDalarii
the utter lack In all the German tun.
clal reports of any claims of Urge
captures of prisoners or war muni
tions. U the lloumanlan armv actu.
ally had been trapped bv the an.
circling movement around Orsova and
Tornn-Severtn. resetting overto Crai
ova. It was regarded as certain the
Henin official reports would hv.
chronicled big captures of men and
supplies.
One other source of hooe wa tha
report from German correspondents
at von Kalkenhayn's headquarters
mat runner progress beyond the Alt
was delayed because of the conditions
of the roads. Doth of these blta of
new led military experts here to re
construct a story of an orderly re-
ireat or the Roumanian forces from
the angle on which two arms of the
Teutonic forces are now exerting
pressure.
There was no disposition, however.
to disguise the fact that Roumanla
Is still perilously placed, if it were
summer weather, and If the terrain
were not rain-soaked or muddy from
half frosen slush, the crossing of the
Danube by the Teutonic forces, In an
effort to turn the flank of the Rou
manians, might prove successful. As
It Is their presence on Roumanian
soli constitutes an ever-nresent
mensce.
Reports here say that a number of
allied aviators have reached Buchar
est. It Is believed also that Russia
has by this time poured heavy rein
forcements Into Roumanla, probably
Including a large number of cannon.
The greatest handicap which the
Roumanians have had was their lack
of aerial scouts to seek out and re
port the sort of encircling movements
which have formed the basis for von
Kalkenhayn's energetlo ' movements.
Their artillery also has been out
ranged by the German.
As near as can be estimated here,
from official statements on both sides,
the battle line In Roumanla now runs
approximately Trom the Transylva
nlan Alps north of Cum polling, oiith
westward to a point a little north of
Cnrtea do Arges, nod thence to the
Alt river, probably somewhere about
Romlcu-Valcu. 1
1 Following southward down the Alt,
the Roumanians apparently hold It to
a point slightly oast of Slntlna. Bast
ward again, this Una runs to a point
a little north of Alexandria. Here
the Roumanians are at grips with the
forces which crossed the Danube In
an effort to turn their flank.' Still
farther east, along the southern front,
Is Gulrgca.nrher gttempb has been
msdo to fort's a Crossing of the Dan
ube by the Bulgarian-German forces.
This point Is a bare forty miles due
south of BneWMt',:"

Invited guests sat down to the Mon
day luncheon today, and after the
dinner, prepared by the ladles of the
Methodist church, had been disposed
ot enjoyed a half hour filled to the
last minute -with entertaining and In
structive addresaes.
Prof. F. C. Relroers, of the south
ern Oregon experiment station at
Talent, spoke ot the work that was
being done for the cause of the horti
culturist and the agriculturist by the
station. He first called attention to
the value of the experiments in the
fertilisation of lands for alfalfa,
pointing to the saving In the coat of
fertiliser through the discovery ot the
fact that the soils ot the Rogue valley
needed sulphur more than any other
fertilising agent. Yields of alfalfa,
said Mr. Relmers, had been Increased
from SO to 1,000 per cent through
the application of a sulphur fertiliser,
Hie fertiliser being applied at a coat
of only It per acre.
Mf. Relmers also told of the ex
tensive work done In combatting the
pear blight In the valley, and finally
the finding of a variety ot foreign
pear stork that was absolutely blight
resistant. With the use of resistant
roots and trunk upon which to graft
the Bartlett and other pears that
were susceptible ot blight, he said
that the disease could be controlled
and eliminated.
Prof. Relmers was especially force
ful In his remarks upon the need for
Irrigation In the Rogue valley, and
he advised his audience to put forth
every effort to bring through to sue-;

Raid on European Shipping
New York, Nov. 27. Wireless
flashes from British cruisers directed
to all entente ally shipping in Ameri
can waters, warning them to be on
the lookout for German submarines.
Intensified reports here today of Ger
man submarines nearlng the United
Slates, preparing for a wholesale raid
on shipping.'
The warning, which was first heard
from the cruiser Lancaster, advised
all ships to travel with fear lights and
to toe prepared for an Instant encoun

cluded the water between 8able la
land and north of Bermuda, west of

A rumor also reached New York
that two submarines are among the
mall .islands near the New Hamp
shire coast. ' One ot these la said to
be the U-6S, the submersible which
sank Ave ships near Nantucket In
October. "
Among ships or the allies due to
arrive this week are the Laconi and

Lapland, a White Star liner, from
Liverpool, and the Duca d'Acosta,
from Genoa, and the British ship Ber

The American liners Kroonland

Is as follows:
"A. B. M. V. (Call for all British

TO ANNIHILATE
ROUMANIAN ARf.lY
The general's eyebrows moved up
and down, and his eyes looked out
sharply, as only vbn Falkenbayn's
eyes can do. He nodded assent.
"When will the Roumanian army
be destroyed T" I asked.
A tew officers standing nearby
smiled. But Falkenhayn looked
straight at his questioner as he said:
"Rain or snow, a railroad accident,
or most anything can destroy the best
made plans. I have been in this war
two and a halt years, and can say
the only certain thing about It Is
uncertainty. 1 am only certain of
one thing and that Is, that we Will
win."

WALL ST. !'
OLD
EUROPEAN
WAR C0L1ET0END
h Washington, Nov. 27. That "Wall
street" .wants the European war to
end, is the opinion ot certain diplo
mats here today.
' "Just a touch of timidity" over se
curities for vast loans, plus a grow
ling decrease In munitions contracts,
is said to be responsible for this In
creasing financial desire for peace.
The financiers are said to fear not
measureably yet, but sufficiently to
stir them that their loans may be
affected If Europe tries to pile up
more credit while destroying more
lives and property.
, This spirit was called the "Inspira
tion" for recent peace talk, notably In
New York, by a high official today. .
According to this official, those
holding the view that "Wall street is
showing reatlvenesa," claimed to see
encouragement in the recent state
ment In an Interview -with the Earl of
Derby, British ' unden-secretary of
war, that England waa willing to
listen to Germany's peace terms.
The present peace agitation, which
diplomats emphasised has Its source
In financial circles solely, will in
clude, according to plans, for Presi
dent Wilson, possibly In co-operation
with European neutrals, to call it
conference, not primarily to discuss
peace, but merely to define objects
for which each side In the great war
Is lighting.
The .proposals do not Include, sug
gestions, for. an armistice.. but diplo?
mats here (believe that It the sug
gestion Is carried through to the
point ot a conference ot neutrals, an
armistice would be entirely within
possibility's bounds.
