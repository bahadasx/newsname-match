The Teutonic campaign against Ru- j
mania is drvplnninr rnrvrllv with '

converging drive on Bucharest from
three directions. The capital seems
most threatened now from the south
west where the invaders approached
within fifty miles after forcing a pas
sage of the Danube at two points and
effecting a junction with the armies
from the lower Alt. The rapid Teu
tonic advance southeast of Craiova
turned the flank of the Alt line as was
the case in the Danube crossings.
These with continued pressure on the
northern end resulted in the Ruman
ians" abandoning the Alt, line. Buch
arest announced this together with
a Rumanian retirement to the east of
the'Topolog river. ,
The Teutons Jiave been held to the
north and northwest passes east of
the Alt and entente writers assume
the Russians are sending additional
forces to assist the Rumanians further
south. Sofia said the Bulgarians

List of Exhibits and a
Good Attendance
Fine
A Star reporter 'looking over the
fair grounds this morning felt encour
aged at what he saw.'
The main object of interest was the
agricultural building into which ex
hibits were rapidly coming. Orange
Springs ahcbBurbank will each be
ther with a carload apiece. William
Gist, who was in the building, said
Mcintosh would be there with the bells
on and we all know what that means.
Jim Fennell the Kendrick farmer,
was putting his stuff in shape, and
there was a right mart from other
individuals.
There was lots of stuff in the house
hold department and the woman's
building was filling up with all sorts
cf pretty and useful things.
There were good beginnings for the
poultry show and live stock was be
ginning to come in. It is intimated
that this department will be unusually
good. We hear there will be at least
130 Hampshire hogs on exhibition.
There were beginnings in Machinery
Hall. Charlie Fox was fixing up
Gerig's drugstore, and said with calm
assurance that that very convenient
feature was going to be better than
ever.
Principal Barnwell of Fessenden
said the colored folks would hold their
end up. The horsemen were exercis
ing their animals, and the showmen
were putting their attractions into
place.
The Star thinks there is reason to
believe there will be a good fair.

Europe and the West Indies reported
catching a warning sent by wireless
from the British cruiser Lancaster off
this port last night. "None saw sub
marines. There have been rumors
for several days that two German
submarines broke through , the allies'
cordon and wer headed for the At
lantic coast.
The Lancaster , last night - warned
entente ships to avoid trade routes
and converging points and show no
unnecessary lights, saying that sub
marines were likely to be encountered
anywhere in the Atlantic, especially

TOUGH CROWD IN TOWN
Sheriff and City Marshal Have Made
Arrangements to Keep Them
Straight
An unusually tough looking crowd
came into town yesterday and seem
to be making preparations to stay
during the fair. Our authorities were
warned of this element by officers in
Gainesville.
This bunch doesn't belong, as some
folks think, to the carnival, but tags
around after it, and the carnival peo
ple get a good deal of blame for it.
It had better be good while it is
here, as the sheriff will have several
plain clothes men on the fair grounds,
while the police force has been largely
reinforced. Marshal Carter was hand
ing out a lot of beautiful new clubs at
the -city hall this morning, and the
"cracker" policemen will not be a bit
slow to use them if; necessary
It might be a good thing for the
tough bunch to move on, as both, thl
city streets and county roads netd
working.

Wrorth as Much in the Seed Today as
the Lint Was a Few
Years Ago
Just think of it! Cotton in the seed
is worth today as much as the lint
was worth several years ago, and
those in a position to watch the mar
ket say it;will go to sixty cents in a
very short time. Down at the gin of
George Giles & Co. there are 160 400-
pound bales of the beautiful 55-cent
staple, and it will not take, much
figuring to see that the cotton is
worth around $35,000.- If the plans
now under way are carried out, and
Giles never undertakes anything to
fail, this cotton another year will do
even better than 55 cents, for though
the market may drop below that
figure the cotton will be spun into
thread and yarn and will bring far
more money than if sold in the lint.
The. work of putting up the big brick
home for the Ocala Spinning Factory
is going right ahead, the first carload
of brick has arrived and the founda
tion excavations are about completed,
and most of the rock for the concrete
work is on the spot. '
Giles & Co. have just shipped a
carload of 18,000 -pounds of cotton
seed and have 1000 bushels more to go
out in a few days.
They will have ready for the farm
ers of Marion county before planting
time 1000 busTiels of Sea Island cot
ton seed, the best seed that can be had
for planting. This seed is all bought
and comes from sections never affect
ed with boll weevil.
Giles & Co. have over $5,000 worth
of velvet beans on hand, and this is
now moving out, and a good many in
quiries are. coming in for the seed.
The seed are very choice, and find a
ready demand, as the planters know
seed can be depended on if they come
rom this firm.
LOCAL BANK DISTRIBUTORS
FOR McKINLEY GOLD DOLLARS
The new McKinley Memorial gold
dollar, minted by the Philadelphia
mint is coming into nation-wide dis
tribution through duly appointed nat
ional banks, trust companies, savings
banks and savings and loan companies.
A shipment of these coins has arriv
ed at Ocala to The Commercial Bank.
The profile of the McKinley head ap
pears in relief on the face of the coin
and on the back is a facsimile of the
new McKinley birthplace memorial,
built in Niles, Ohio., on the site of the
old McKinley home. A coinage of
only 100,000 of these coins was author
ized by Act of Congress and the dies
have been destroyed. The coin, there'
fore, will be scarce in only a few years
and become rare in value. Because of
the limited supply those desiring coins
should make application at once to the
official distributing bank; The Com
mercial Bank, of Ocala.
