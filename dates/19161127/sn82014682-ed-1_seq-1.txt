P WHO EXPLOIT WOMEN
Alleged Panderers Arraigned
in Police Court and Held on
$250 Bail; Underworld is
Shaken By News of Arrests
Rapid developments In the Iwilei
situation, resulting from the movement
of the citizens against commercial
vice in Honolulu, today Include the fol
lowing: 1. At 3 o'clock this morning, under
orders from Sheriff Rose, Deputy
Sheriff Aech and Capt of Detectives
McDuffle led a big squad of detectives
and patrolmen to Iwilei and raided the
resort.
2." Thirteen ; men were arrested
-charged by the police with attending
a place used for the purposes cf com
mercial vice. In plainer language, the
police charge these men with being
"pimps" and panderers,
3. They were arraigned In police
court at 10 o'clock, after a consulta
tion between Police Judge Monsarrat,
"Capt. Mc Duff is and Deputy City Attor
ney Chilllngworth and formally
charjed. Then Chillingworth asked
the couriTte-continje" the cases until
. Wednesday, setting bail meanwhile at
p$0:each. The Judge complied with
the request. "
4. The territorial grand Jury,
which has been investigating condi
tions at Iwilei and commercial vice in
Honolulu for several weeks, was called
by City Attorney Brown and Foreman
W. H. McClellan to meet at 2 this
afternoon. The cases of the 13 men
in police court were put over, the city
attorney's office states, so that, the
firand Jury can take up this new phase
of the matter. , - ,.
Probability developed during the
-day that the grand . Jury may have a
report-on Its Iwilei Investigation to
KhJ oresent either late today or tomorrow.
6. Rev. C. H, McVey, pastor of the
Katihi Union church, who succeeded
in getting a conviction of a woman
bwnec of a disorderly house last week
, In police court, is one of the witness
es to oe called today. It is presumed
the grand Jurors wish to hear what he
personally knows concerning vice out
side Iwilei.
7. A special meeting of the board
of directors of the chamber of com-
merce has been called for Wednesday
f? to consider the vice situation.
8. U. S. Marshal Smlddy appeared
" at the police court hearing of the men
taken at Iwilei, to see if any evidence
- is brought out warranting prosecution
.. under the federal law. Such prosecu
' tion would probaby be under the Ed
munds act.
The underworld" of Honolulu was
shaken to its obscene depths in the
. early hours of this morning when
more than a dozen of its habitues
1 men alleged by the police to be those
creatures who live off the earnings of
fallen women and exploint shame and
vice were trapped in a . sudden and
spectacular raid of Iwilei by the Ho
nolulu police.
The raid was made between 3 and
4 o'clock. If reports are true, an hour
later the" alarm had been widespread
and the underworld was "wise" to
the fact that the police had acted with
' unlooked-for suddenness.

LE SCHEIE
Offer of Petticoat ior Five Let
ters and One Dime Barred
From the Mails i
If any one has received from the
mainland a letter promising you a
$4.75 silk petticoat if you will send 10
cents to the National Mall Order
Rrokeraee ComDany of 520 Globe
building, Minneapolis, It is best not
to send the dime. .
At least one woman , in Honolulu
has received such a letter and perhaps
more have had them. However, if any
answers are mailed here to the con
cern they will be returned by the Ho
nolulu postofflce to the senders or
will be forwarded to the dead letter
bureau.
An official fraud order from the
postofflce department telling of the
swindle has been received by Acting
PAstmaster William C Peterson from
Acting Postmaster General J. C.
Koons. The order directing all post
masters to bar from the mails all let
ters addressed to the swindlers is sup
plemented by a notice from the post
office department's solicitor, W. H.
Lamar, dated October 30, describing
the methods of operation. '
"All postmasters are directed to
withdraw from the malls all mail mat
ter of any kind addressed to this con
cern." says the order, "and return to
the sender where known, or send to
the dead letter office if unknown."
According to Solicitor Lamar's post
script, the scheme is worked as fol
lows: "A silk petticoat worth 14.75 is prom-
.used the addressee provided sne win
remit 10 cents to the concern and
send 'five exact copies of the letter
received by her to five of her acquaint
ances." The postal authorities discov
ered the swindle and stopped it by is
suing a. fraud , order, acting on the
grounds that the concern obtained
money under false pretenses. '
A despatch from Washington to the
Herald-Republican of Salt Lake City,
dated November 11, says that as a re
sult of this action taken by the post
office department postmasters through
cut the country have sent to the dead
letter office 70,000 letters, containing
a similar number of dimes, sent by
trusting women to the concern which
promised to deliver a $4.75 petticoat,
"1917 model," for 10 cents. Of the
500,000 letters which continued to pour
the Minneapolis postofflce some 60
cen wen "?t"raef senders.
The rest went to the dead letter office.

NO BIG EXODUS
OF LABORERS IS
Alarming Hilo Report Appears
Not to Be Borne Out By
Facts Adduced
SOME FILIPINOS WILL
PROCEED TO MAINLAND
Oriental Steamers to Take Few
More Than for Several
Months Just Past
There is no unprecedented exodus of
plantation laborers indicated by the
bookings of the steamship companies
here either to Japan or to the main
land following the payment of bonuses
to the laborers of the various sugar
companies. Some increase in the num
ber of Filipinos booking for passage
to the mainland is found but that in
crease :s not alarming.
Advices, from Hilo under date of
November 22 said that the bonus ss
tern was. not working as had been ex
pected and that with the final pay
ments u borers were leaving in droves
and a thortag3 of labor was threat
ened. The report continued that it
was said unofficially a new method of
bonus payments would be arranged by
the plantations . :
Investigations here do not bear out
the alarming view of the labor situa
tion sent here from Hilo. A.,W. T,
Bottornley, president of the planters
association, sa id this morning. that he
considered any criticism of bonus pay
meuts at this time premature; that
time ahoold be given to see how it
would work out. Then If changes be
necessary they can be made but
thus far there was nothing to indicate
that 'the plan was the failure which
the Hilo despatches indicated. That
aborers' would leave the plantations
and 'take -"a trip after receiving the
bonuses paid them he considered quite
natural. They would want to make
purchases and to. enjoy themselves,
but he thought the majority would be
found back on the plantations when
work demanded them there.
According to the shipping depart
ment of Castle & Cooke, the local Mat-
soii and Toyo Kisen Kalsha agency,
steerage' bookings of Filipinos on the
Wilhelmina, to leave at 10 a. m. Wed
nesday for San Francisco, are heavier
than usual. The total number of

There were 15 Filipinos who got on

Francijco out of 75 who are booked
in the steerage. The Wilhelmina,
leaving ' here November 1, took 29

The rame agency said today that
bookings to the Orient on the T. K. K.
liner Shinyo Maru, to leave here De
cember 14 for Yokohama, are no heav
ier than they have been right along.
There are 400 Japanese booked for
the Shinyo, but this is not an unusu
ally large number as the Asiatics pre
fer to travel oa the big boats. They
have booked in the last week or two.
C. Brewer & Company, Oceanic
