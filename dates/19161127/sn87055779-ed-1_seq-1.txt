CARRANZA OFFICIALS
AT JUAREZ WORRIED
Refugee Tells How Lives of
Americans at Parral Were
Saved Through Pleas
of Gen. Salazar.
Intern.itional News Service:
EL PASO, Texas, Nov. 2 7. The
result of the tattle for Chihuahua
City was in doubt early today.
On the fifth day of Villa's assault
the city remained completely iso
lated, telegraphic communication
having been interrupted since Sat
urday morning. Villa had captured
the penitentiary and was storming
Carranza barricades in the streety
when the last dispatches were tiled.
Humors persisted today that the
Villistas have captured the city and
that Gen. Trtvino is retreating
northward. These reports could not
be verified, but Mexicans in Juarez
grew more restless as hours passed
without definite news, and it was
feared here that the Juarez garrison
might revolt. Many Juarez families
have crossed to tlie American iide ot
the border in the last 2 4 houn. fear
ing an outbreak.
Carranza otticials at Juarez are
plainly worried over the fate of the
state capital. Neither they nor fed
eral agents here place any reliance
in dispatches sent via Mnrfa and
Ojinaga Saturday, claiming a Carran-
zista victory.
Americans Il-tupe.
A refugee reaching the border to
day told how Gen. Salazar. now with
Villa leading the assault on Chihua
hua City, saved the lives of Ameri
cans at Parral when Villistas enter
ed the town. The Americans and
many other foreigners were being
marched to the cemetery for execu
tion when Salazar intervened.
"Our families now in America ar
receiving protection." he told Villa.
"We should not kill them."
Villa reluctantly turned the Amer
icans loose.
Federal agents today began an
investigation of an ammunition
smuggling plot as the result of the
arrest of two train crews at Juarez,
charged with smupgliivg ammunition-
to Villa in coal cars. This ammuni
tion, it was learned. was first
smuggled across the border here for
Carranza. but was diverted by Villa's
friends. The smugglers offered to de
liver to Villa l.r.OibOOO rounds.
I P TO OAIIKAXZA.
Internntioriiil News service:
WASHINGTON. Nov. 27. The
determination of relations between
the Cnited Stales and Mexico is once
more siuarely up to Carranza. The
f.rst chief's attitude as expressed
fither in accepting or rejecting the
Atlantic City protocol, will point the
way to the future course of the
United State?, state department otli
cials said today.
There 1? grave apprehensin here
that Gen. Carranza wiil reject the
agreement on account of its provi
sion for the pursuit of Mexican raid
t rs back into Mexico if they cross
the American frontier, although no
such reciprocal right is given Mexi
can commanders.
It is true that this provision is
contained in a separate memoran
dum, bat it is intended so far as the
t'nited States is concerned to have
binding force. The continuance of
activity of Villa and his forces of
a larger scale around Chihuahua has
caused both state and war depart
ment officials to abandon all expec
ttion of an early withdrawal of Gen.
I etching's troops from Mexico or
the return of the national guards
iv.en from the border.
The necessary rehabilitation of
Carranza's national treasury by a
I.irge American loan, it is thought
1 ere. may forte the first chief to
..ecept the objectionable terms of
the border auri e::.ent against hi
VC ill

Intrn-iti- n ii News Sendee:
NEW YORK. Nov. 27. Ever-increasing
reports of German war sub
marines lurking off the New Eng
land coast waiting for allied ship
ping caused intense anxiety in mari
time circles here today. The most
tangible of the Mood of rumors and
reports was a general warning sent
out to all allied shipping by the
British cruiser Lancaster, patrolling
beyond the three-mile limit, to be
ware of the underwater menace. It
was reported that two war sub
marines had succeeded in creeping
through the allied cordon and were
somewhere off the New England
coast.
The anxiety in shipping circles
was increased by the fact that some
of the largest of trans-Atlantic
liners are due in New York this
week, each with heavy passenger
lists. Included in these are two
Cunard liners, Eaconia and Pan
nonia; the Anchor liner Tuscania,
and the White Star's Lapland all
from British ports and the Bnica
