TO COMBAT INTRODUCTION
OF COLORED LABOR
Trades Unionism of Great Britain
Passes Resolution- of Protest.
London, Nov. 6. Trade unionism,
which has been growling informally
at the prottect of the introduction of
colored labor in Great Britain- since
the proposition was first mooted has
now made a formal protest. The Na
tional Transport Workers Federation
one of the largest unions, has passed a
resolution condemning certain prapo-i
sals of the government affecting la
bor. The resolution says in part:
"The Federation's executive hopes
that the authorities will not be so ill
advised as to attempt the introduc
tion of any class of colored labor on
the docks r other water side places
of employment. In the existing crisis
to think of employing colored labor
would mean the recrudescence of all
the trouble and discontent experienced
by the increased employment of Chi
nese in the mercantile marine."

der control protocol signed in Atlan
tic City last week and the full report
of Secretary Lansing's statement de
fining In part the policy of the United
States government toward Mexico be
fore they will make any comment on
either. .
There Is evidence, however, that the
news of the protocol and of Secretary
Lane's statement has been . received
with mixed feelings. There is seem
ingly satisfaction that an arrangement
has been reached for the withdrawal
of the American troops from Mexico
and for the control of the border but
this is tempered by the feeling that
Secretary Lane's statement will re
quire deep consideration. The terms
of the protocol mentioning a delay of
forty days for the withdrawal of the
troops. if conditions permit of such
action, is adversely commented On in
some quarters as many influential men
had hoped for the immediate recall of
