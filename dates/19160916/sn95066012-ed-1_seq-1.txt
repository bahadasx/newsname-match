Take Enemy Positions with a Number

Fighting.
London, Sept. 15 Tinder Bin ashing
blows delivered by the Entente forces,
all the Allies on ibis front now being
represented with the entry of Russian
troops in the fighting, the Bulgar-Teu-ton
defense line is rapidly crumbling.
The Serbians, after several days of
brilliant lighting, have overwhelmed
the Bulger positions in front of them,
capturing twenty-live guns a1 a large
number of prisoners, causing 'he ene
my to retreat precipitately for more
than nine miles; the French have cap
tured positions half a mile deep over
a front of a mile to the east of Var
dar, while- the Uritlsh, west of that riv
er, near the center of the allied front,
took by assault the town of Makukovo
from a mixed Bulgar and German
force, as well as two points north of
this locality. These successes are an
nounced otllcially. Unofficial advices
say Russian troops have captured vil
lages north of Kastoria, which town
(southwest of Fiorina) has been evac
uated by the Bulgars, who, however,
have occupied and fortified the
heights of Coryba to the north of it.

PUBLIC WELFARE ASSOCIATION.
Annual Meeting at Library Hall Next
Tuesday Evening.
The annual meeting of the Cublic
Welfare association will be held in
Library hall Tuesday evening at 7.45.
Since the reorganization in January
community work has been carried out
through departments. .Many adjust
ments have been necessary and the
newness of the method has made the
work difficult but splendid results
have already been achieved. Eornier
activities have been continued and
new developments begun. The mem
bership lias been increased to 17a,
athletic work in direct connection
with the high school begun, the Camp
Fire girls have added two new groups
and coordinated all their work, the
dramatic department has allied itself
with the Dramatic League of America
and given the community a remark
able Shakesperian production, the,
social center department has started
Library Hall well on its way to being
a social center for all our young peo
ple, while nearly every lamlly In the
village has been touched in some
way.
While organization by departments
has made specialized and intensive
work possible it has also made every
member less familiar with the work
as a whole. The Public Welfare as
sociation is organized to promote such
influences and conduct such activities
as shall make for the health, happi
ness and prosperity of all the people.
Its membership and workers are
drawn Irrespective of sex, creed or
social position, aiming to secure unity
of action and devotion to the common
good by all the people of Bennington
for all the people. The past history of
community wink has been interesting,
but insignificant when compared with
the possibilities now Being before it.
Every parent, every friend of children
and everyone interested in the com
mon good should ally himself with
the Public Welfare association. All
such are cordially invited to attend
the annual meeting of the association
become familiar witli its work and
make suggestions for its future devel
opment NEED MORE PATROL MONEY
County Improvement Association Has
Run Out of Funds.
More money is needed to continue
the patrol In ;hls village and North
Bennington. Inasmuch as the state
board of health has seen fit to post
pone the opening of the town ami vil
lage schools it would seem necessary
that the patrol be t ontiued. New cases
of infantile paralysis are being report
ed in New York and Massachusetts
tow es and to safeguard the children
of Bennington against the dread di
sease the patrol should be continued.
The Bennington County Improv e-
ment association has undertaken to
raise funds for the purpose, as neither
tate or town money is available for
the purpose. There has been no gen
eral response to the appeal but some
of the generous ami public spirited
residents have provided enough
money to maintain the patrol up to
the present time. The association
Is now out of money and is again call
ing upon the IH'ople to help them
selves in the trying emergency. Con
tribution! will be received at the Ben
nington County National bank.
Rcviting the Ten Corr mandments.
The forthcoming general convention
of the Protestant Episcopal church
ill have before it e proposal emanat
ing from a commission of bi.-hops,
clergy ami laymen to alter the torni of
of the 10 commandments as they arc
now printed in the catechism and the
communion once, The commission
reports in favor of shortening the
commandments by the omission of
the time honored reasons for their ob
servance, me proiMiseu change win
affect the iirst Ave commandments so
that they will read as follows:
I, Thou Shalt have none oilier Uod
but me.
8, Thou shall net make to thyself
any graven Image, nor the likeness of
any thing that is in heaven above, or
in the earth beneath, or In the- water
under the earth; thou shall not bow
down to them, nor worship them.
:i. Thou slialt not take the name of
the land thy Cod in vain.
4. Remember that thou keep holy
the Sabbath tin).
5, Honor thy lather and thy moth
er. The commission has recommended
these change for the reason that the
argument! lor the observance 01
these dlvlhe laws are not parts of the
commandments themselves; they
were peculiar to the national life of
the Lsraelltiei ami changed conditions
have robbed the srgumoift! ol much
of their weight.
