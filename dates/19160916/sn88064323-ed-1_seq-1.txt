ROSE HILL SIDEWALK.
The sidewalk across the front of
Rose Hill Cemetery was built a
year ago and the first payment
was then made. The second pay
ment, tor this year, becoming due,
Mr. A. B Murray, the Pres of
the Hose Hill Cemetery Associa
non, took the matter np personal
ly with those who are interested
there ami collected an amount suf
tiieutly large to meet the next
payment and interest promptly.
The sidewalk cost was 1385 08.
The first payment, made last year,
was #110, This left a balance of
#275.08 This balance was dtvid
ed into five equal annual pay
ments of 55 01, pins the interest
at 6 per cent on the unpaid part,
or 416 50, making the payment,
for this year 471 51.
Mr. Murray's idea is to make
the payments small and have ev
ery family interested in the ceme
tery contribute their part, so that
the sidewalk may become an im
provement shared by all. As
soon as an annual payment and id
terest can be collected, it will be
no deposited as to be available on
dam and to meet the next payment.

In far seeiug political wisdom
the West has pnt it all over the
rest of the country, ft will have
exactly twice as much Infitience in
determining the election in No

other states Whjî Because men
only will vote in the East and

gether go to the polls in the west

double the protection for the
