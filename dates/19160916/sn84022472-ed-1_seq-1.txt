TOLL TO SOUTHERN
POINTS TOO GREAT
New York Shippers Have
Advantage, Claim of Man
ufacturers Here.
Washington, Sept. 1 6 Complaint
was made to the Interstate Commerce'
Commission . today by the . Boston
Chamber of Commerce, the Manu
facturers 1 Association of Bridgeport,
Conn., the Chamber of Commerce of
Providence, R. I., ' and other similar
organizations, that- class and com
modity freight rates of the New Haven
and other railroads from New Eng
land cities' through Boston and Provi
dence to points in Georgia, Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Ten
nessee and central and western Ken
tucky are discriminatory m that they
exceed rates through New York city,
i
This action fostered by the Boston
Chamber of Commerce is understood
to be taken by local organizations in"
an effort to maintain the manufacture
ing supremacy of New England. Rail
road freight rates have long been ad'
Justable under classifications that of
fered equal opportunities for various
remote manufacturing sections to
compete with larger, metropolitan dis
tricts. It Is now alleged that by reaT
son of the added New England freight
tolls on both class and commodity
freights, ,New, York shippers, though
smaller in bulk than the combined
manufacturing districts of New Eng
land, have i preference.
It Is said today by shippers in this
city that Bridgeport and New Haven
are seeking rather to come within the
New York classification than to break
down the general freight rates for
New England. It is expected at the
hearing which will be ordered many
local manufacturers will discuss both
phases of the situation as It relates to
this city. ,

Joint commission, whio his seeking
a solution of the international - prob

tion, in the absence of the Mexican
commissioners today studied the sub
jects to be discussed at the resump
tion of business next week. Major
General Tasker H. Bliss was " called
into the consultation. It is believed
unlikely, however, that the earlier
meetings of the commission will deall
with the question of border protec
tion. It is more probable that Internal
Mexican affairs, regarded by the
Americans as the more basic points at
issue, will be considered. .

Studying New British
1 Ruling.
Washington,. Sept. 16. While he
state department Is investigating the
latest British order restraining com
merce to Norway, Sweden, Denmark
and Holland, officials are in some
doubt as to whether It affects Ameri
can goods already covered by letters
of assurance through the operation of
The Netherlands Overseas Trust.
The British embassy officials say It
does net. They say no change so
fundamental as that reported in Lon
don ' despatches could possibly have
been made without notification to
them here. '
The only official Information before
the state department a cablegram
from Consul General Skinner, dated
September It seems to support the
view that the new order actually
works no change, for it says "it is
presumed that American goods al
ready covered by letters of assurance
will not be stopped."
Absolutely no change of policy has
been made by England in months, ac
cording to Officials of the British em
bassy.
The plan to allow only enough Im
ports into neutral states and calling
on Germany to provide them with such
a stock of goods as they consumed be
fore the war the Britih officials say,
has been in operation many months.
They point out that when th max
imum stock In any country is reached
no more "letters of assurance" are
given to Americans and no more 11-;
censes are given to British exporters.

Paper Growlers, ' '
Deceptive to Eye,
1 A New Institution
The time old custom of "rushing
the can," or "rushing the growler,"
as one may prefer to call It, Is fast
becoming obsolete in Bridgeport
and it will soon be but a memory
In the class wiui hobble skirts and
the Bull Meose. The up-to-date
citizen now takes home his beer in
a round paper contrivance which is
thoroughly sanitary. This holds
about two large glassfuls of the
beverage and is similar m appear
ance to those used by some dealers
,for carrying ice cream or oysters.
The system is being tried out by
saloonkeepers with much success,
as It has many advantages. Tne
tell tale glint of the pall is no
longer seen by the neighbors and
the receptacle Is easily carri'ed.
There is no danger of hitting an ob
truding gate post with a resonant
bang. It has al.o the virtue of en
couraging the sale of the beer as a
man, made happy by a- drink or
two while on his way home. Is now
reminded that "the folks" might
like some too, and the old obstacle
of "nothing to carry It in" has been
effectively removed.

CORSET WORKERS
IN HOT DISPUTE
OVER SUFFRAGE
Delegates to State Conven
tion Have Hard Time Ex
plaining Their Votes.'
COMRADES THOUGHT
THEY WERE "ANTIS"
Sentiment Nearly Equally
Divided, Many Join Im
promptu Debate.
Misunderstanding over the action of
the Bridgeport delegates to the State
Federation of Labor convention early
this month,, caused excitement last
night at the meeting of the Corset
Workers' union, held in Odd Fellows'
hall, and a spirited debate on the
woman suffrage question ensued.
Somebody started the rumor that
the local delegates, who formed one
of the three women's deputations to
the convention, had placed the Cor
set Workers' union on record against
equal franchise by voting against en
dorsement by the federation. The
delegates had voted merely to able
the suffrage question until next year,
but they had a hard time explaining
it.
The Corset Workers' union contains
many persons opposed to equal fran
chise, which fact was disclosed last
night. Expression of opinion by the
pro-suffrage group caused an argu
ment in which no decision was reach
ed. When everybody started talking
at once the chairman called a halt.
At one of the State Federation ses
sions, M. Toscan Bennett, a Fairfield
county leader for the suffragists, ob
tained permislon to speak and. she
asked the convention to go on record
for suffrage. . Because the session was
a tremendously busy one, and the
members had had no time to consider
the matter fully, they voted to table
It until next year.

den of proof rests with Knapp. He
must show that sentiment adverse to
him exists.
To combat the Idea of antl-Knapp
feeling the state police have been busy
gathering affidavits. - It is said that
about 300 have been collected already,
A large number have -been procured
from this city and also from Stam
ford, South , Norwalk, Danbury and
other parts of the county. In these
affidavits citizens say upon oath that
they know of no reason why Knapp

county.
The former banker Is accused of
appropriating about $100,000 from the
depositors .of the defunct firm of Burr

will make bis first court appearance
of the present term and will argue for
the state against the change of venue.
Exhume Man's Body
to See If He Had
Foot With 6 Toes
The fact that the body of the man
found floating in the water at the foot
of Seavlew avenue . Wednesday had
normal feet instead of six toes on one
of them prevented it from being iden
tified as that of a Mr. Stone of New
York city. A Mrs. Stone of that city
whose husband had been mlBstng since
May, came here today to view the
clothing found on the drowned 'man.
Some of the articles, particularly the
belt buckle with an old English "S"
on It were Identical and she was for a
moment sure, that it was the body of
her absent husband. She said, how
ever, that Mr. Stone had had six toes
on one foot and that would positively
identify him.
Dr. Edward M. Fitzgerald, assistant
medical examiner who had charge of
the case in the absence of Dr. S. M.
Garlick, agreed to exhume the body
from Potter's field where it had been
burled soon after it was found because
of Its advanced state of decomposi
tion. This was done and examination
proved that the dead man had never
had more than five toes on either foot.
The body was buried again, and Mrs.
Stone departed for her home relieved
that her fears were unfounded.
