DEMOCRATS NOT
SO JUBILANT
OVERJLECTION
Since tho Maine election, tho Wil
son stock has fallen considerable be
(low par In Logan and Cncho Valloy.
I With the entire Btnto nnd county ait-
ministrations in tho hands of tho
1 Domocrnts, and with a victory of 13,
COO for the Republican ticket, makes
tho Democrats locally fool that thoy
aro to havo a blggor light on their
hands than they ever dreamed of.
President Wilson asked for the sup
port of tho Maine voters, If they
could endorse his administration. Ev
idently his administration could not
bo endorsed, Judging from tho over
whelming victory for Republican can
didates from governor, senators, con
gressmen and oven down to tho coun
ty oiricerj throughout the entlro stato
of Maine.
In Cache county, however, the Dem
ocrats are still putting on n bold front.
They hold their nightly meetings in
their elaborate headquarters In tho
Eagle block. Tho candidates aro des
perate, and will win If It Is possible
Commissioner Facer, Representative
Cardon, Engineer Humphreys with
Chairman Romney, Secretary Evans,
and other old heads, aro directing tho
work of tho campaign.
The Young Mon'8 Democratic Club
which has been talked of so much,
has practlcully proved a fizzle. It has
now been settled in tho minds of tho
old lino Democrats If they wish to
win, on them devolves the work. It
has been a good many years slnco
these gentlemen have directed tho
affairs of the Democratic party.
At tho county convention, thoro
was but llttlo new blood Injected in
to the party. Either present Incum
bents wero nominated for ofilco, or
deputies" woro olovnted to tho prin
cipals chnlr. These things do not
set good In tho minds of the young
Democracy. They say If it Is up to
them to win the election they must
bo recognized. Their reasoning is
Kood. Why should they bo on tho
lino to continue- In ofilco tho same
men who havo hold ofilco for years 7
Richmond camo to tho county con
vention nnd asked for recognition.
No, said tho convention, your man
W. H. Lowis is n pretty good follow
to work In tho rnnks, help continually
to pllo up majorities for our candi
dates, but you must not nsk for nny
patronage. Richmond has been a good
Democratic strong hold. Is It any
wonder that tho peoplo of that town
aro switching to tho Republican party
where thoy can get recognition?
At tho Republican convention to
day, Richmond Is suro to get tho
recognition sho dosorves. Tho Repub
licans of Cacho county nro broad
enough to bco that tho third lurgcHt
city in tho county Is taken caro of.
There will bo a good strong dele
gation of Republicans down from
Richmond today. Thoy will know
what they want, nnd knowing what
they want, they nro sure to get the
propor consideration. This Is a mat
ter which will bo taken into consider
ation when tho poles aro opened on
tdectlon day, November 7.
