Fullv a quarter of a million people
have attended the Hig Free Fair since

today at the otr.ee of Phil Eastman,
secretary of the association. In mak
ing the estimate this morninc the

J'hil Fastman. secretary of the asso

statement relative to the financial suc
cess of the second free fair in the
world. However, he admitted that the
management broke more than even
for the tirst time in years. A meet
ing of the hoard of managers will be
held some time next week.
Cut Expense Corners.
The budget this year has been
smaller than in years. The manage
ment trimmed every available corner.

materials was purchased by any em
ploye unless the order was signed
either by L. M. Penwell, president, or
Phil Eastman, secretary.

Successful Horse Show.
The horse show Friday ended a se
ries of the most successful exhibitions
of the kind ever held in Topeka. ac
cording .o I'r. U. W. McCampbell, su
perintenner.t of the horse show.
"All exhibitors left pleased," said
Dr. McCampbell. "and everyone re
marked about the 'pep' of the audi
ences, all of which were large. The
price of 2 5 cents was popular and did
away with that old idea that a horse
show is merely a society affair."
The nig purses were won by John
Hook. $1,400; Miss I.oula Long,
$1,305; . J. Mooers, $"C5; Tom Bass,
$565; Bruce Eaton. $515; Hamilton
Bros., $475: R. I Davis. $385.
Miss Loula Long lost again to O. J.
Mooers Friday night in the harness
championship event. The blue ribbon
went to the Mooers horse, "Spring
maid." and the red ribbon to the Long
horse, "Reputation."
But the most spectacular event was
the tive-gaited saddle horse combina
tion, in which there were four entries.
It was a hard task for the judges and
Tom Bass's horse. ' Sultan." and
Bruce Eaton's horse, "Castile." were
obliged to go thru their paces twice
before the judges finally handed the
blue ribbon to the colored man, Bass,
from Mexico, Mo.

Stealing at Manhattan.
The mystery regarding the burglar
izing of the offices of half a dozen
Topeka physicians has been cleared
up. Wade Smith, a 19-year-old boy, a
drug fiend, did it. He confessed to it
while on his way to the Hutchinson
state reformatory from Manhattan,
where he was convicted of 'burglary.
Local officers did not take much
stock in his story but there was a way
to prove or disprove it. He stated that

Hugh Larimer wanted to know
whether Smith was guilty. If he was
there was no use to keep looking in
i Topeka for the burglar. He startea

hidden outfit. He searched in half a
dozen places and finally late in the

"Dope fiends have a hankering for

KANSAS LOOKING
FOR NEW RECORD
IN BANK SHOWING
Call Today for Both State and
National Institutions.
First Indication of Returns on
the 1916 Wheat Crop.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS GOOD
Believed That September 12
Call Will Show 260 Million.
Money From Corn Crop Will
Xot Be Shown Until Later.
Kansas banks botji state and na
tional were today directed to publish
statements as to their financial condi
tion at the close of business Tuesday,
September 1 2. The report will give
the first indication as to the return to
Kansas farmers from their 1916 wheat
crop. It is believed in banking circles
that the showing will break the former
record established June 30, this year,
when Kansas banks showed deposits
aggregating $252,538,397.15.
The joint call for state and national
bank reports at this time is of much
interest in banking and financial cir
cles. The report will definitely out
line the state's financial condition at
this time. Much of the money from
the movement of the 1916 wheat crop
is now in the hands of the Kansas
farmers. The threshing bills have been
paid and the farmers have deposited
their profits. In the cattle and hog
producing counties record prices have
been received during the last few
weeks. ,
Very Uttle Corn.
Very little corn is being gathered
in Kansas this year except In the ex
treme northern counties. The entire
output for the state may not total 50
million bushels. Money from the corn
crop, however, will not affect bank
reports until later in the fall.
Financial conditions in Kansas at
this time are generally regarded as ex
cellent. The bank report, though, will
show definitely the strong and weak
districts, with a grand total for the
state at large. Several shrewd bankers
anticipate another record in the show
ing of the banks both in the matter of
deposits and loans and discounts.
In their reports for June 30, the
state banks showed deposits of $145,
685,397.15 with loans and discounts
of $127.553,544.07. National banks

WAS THEIR "FOURTH OF JULY"
And Tonight Spanish Dances
Will Predominate.
Hundreds Are Here for Their
Annual Festivities!
In Metropolitan hall, 404 Kansas
avenue, in Topeka, hundreds of miles
north of the Rio Grande, the unusual
sight of the red, white and blue flag
of this country and the red, white and
green standard of Mexico, hanging
side by side, could be witnessed today.
The shade of Don Miguel Higaldo
Costilla, sower of the seed of Mexican
independence from European mon
archies, might have paused in its
flight and smiled in ghostly approval.
Hundreds of Mexican citizens in Kan
sas and Missouri were celebrating the
anniversary of independence day in
Mexico, their "Fourth of July."
Neither was it so much different
this afternoon from the American cel
ebration of its kind. The hall was
draped in flags and colors. Speakers
speeches began at 2 o'clock were
greeted with frantic shouts of "Viva
Mexico.
L.ittle was in evidence to suersrest
the war-torn condition of Mexico. Tha
old standard instigated by the Hidalgo
army that struck the first blow for
Mexican freedom the Mexican easle
with beak and talons scoring a snake
was the insignia they recognized
despite the fact that a score of stand
ards now fly over different parts of
aaexico.
1ozens of Speakers.
The program swung off this after
noon with the reading of the Mexican
ac: of independence by Senor Andres
Toledo, secretary of the Mexican or
ganization in charge of the affair.
Dozens of speakers followed.
The Pabellon tricolor the flag of
the historic campaign "de la Parro
quia del pueblo de Dolores" was the
subject of all the oratory. Don Miguel
Hidalgo was eulogized as the savior
of Mexico despite the fact that he was
executed two years before independ
ence was declared. He started his
revolution in 1810, stepping from the
robes of a priest into the uniform of
a soldier. Hei was executed a year
later but before he died he called the
independence assembly and instructed
them to declare independence as soon
as they could meet. They didn't get
a chance to meet until 1813 because
of Spanish activities that meant a fir
ing squad if they were caught at it.
The great celebration of the affair
here will be tonight a Mexican dance.
The old dances of Spain and Mexico
as. danced by the aristocracy and by
peons will be the order. Midnight
may see the dajice hall deserted but
it is doubtful if Sunday morning's
rising sun will do so.

GIRL HIT BY AUTO
Helen Roudebusli, 13 Years Old, Un
conscious in Hospital.
Helen Roudebush, 13 year olii
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. E. H.
Roudebush. 140 Hill street, was
knocked unconscious this mornins
when she was struck by an automo
bile at the fair grounds. The- child
vas removed to St. Francis hospital
and at 10:30 o'clock was still uncon
scious. Physicians attending the girl
at the hospital were unable to an
nounce the extent of her injuries. Her
parents knew nothing of the accident
until a State Journal reporter notified
them. The girl's father is a teacher
in a local business college.
The little girl accompanied by her
sister and brother-in-law, Wilson Don
aldson, with their three children, was
just about to enter the Fine Arts hall.
"Be careful, here comes an auto,"
shouted Mrs. Donaldson.
The girl sprang aside and jumped in
front of another machine. The second
machine struck her in the back and
knocked her down. The name of the
driver is not known.
The girl is expected to recover, ac
cording to Dr. W. D. Storns, who at
tended her. The exact extent of her
injuries cannot be determined at this
time, however, and there is
possi-
bility of internal injuries. One hip
was badly hurt and she was bruised
painfully. No bones are fractured.

Jefferson City, Mo., Sept. 15.
The fourth fire within two months

the prison walls. It was soon extin
guished with a loss of not more than
J1.000.
The fire today, like the other three
that have caused a loss of approxi
mately $250,000. is thought to have
been the work or convicts. I nus rar,
however, prison officials have been
unable to fix the blame upon any in

Prison officials said today that four
fire plants, in addition to the recent
fires, have been found recently which

In Ladder Contest 17 Seconds
and 4.20 Sec. Coupling.
GOOD CROWD AT GROUNDS
State Firemen's Tournament Is
. a Big Attraction.
Wind Too High for Rescue of
Pretty Stenographer.
Clay Center's team of firemen
smashed two world records in the first
event of the Kansas Firemen's Tour
nament at the State fair grounds this
afternoon. They hiive been walking
right down the line with first and sec
ond prizes since the program started.
They established a new 'record of 17
seconds in the ladder contest and one
of 4 1-5 seconds in the coupling con
test. There was a big crowd at (he fair
grounds this afternoon w.hen tho '
tournament started and people were
still crowding into the grandstand. To
night will be one of the big nights at
the grounds. It will be Carnival
night on the Sunflower Trail. All of
the concessions are still on the ground
and the Johnny J. Jones shows will be
on in full blast until the cars quit
running.
The firemen's tournament is taking
on the appearance of an athletic con
test. Most of the contests are athletio
in their nature a'though the fire
fighting machinery in use makes it
much more interesting than an or
dinary athletic contest.
Didn't Rescue Olrl.
The thrilling rescue of a real live
girl from a burning building was
called off this afternoon upon orders
from Phil Eastman, secretary of the
fair association. Mr. Eastman stated
that because of the high wind and the
great amount of lnfammable material
on the grounds following the five days
of crowds, he did not believe the burn
ing of the building would be safe.
In the first ipvent, the ladder-climbing
contest, fifteen men ran 100 yards
and one man climbed a twenty-foot
ladder. The world record for thla
event was 17 1-7 seconds. The Clay
Center team did it In 17 seconds. Be
loit was second in 18 2-5 seconds; Solo
mon was third in 18 3-5 seconds, and
Wamego was fourth in 20 seconds.
Coupling Contest.
In the coupling contest fifteen men
ran fifty feet, made a coupling and
put on a nozzle. The record was 4 3-5
