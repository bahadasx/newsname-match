A WONDERFUL. SERMON.
One of the most remarkable, inspir
ing and intellectual sermons delivered
in Allen Chapel in years was that de
livered by Dr. A. C. Williams, pastor
of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church,
Birmingham, Ala., a delegate to the
National Baptist Convention.
Allen's aristocratic and immense
congregation expected ono of the
ablest men of the convention would be
assigned to preach for them last Sun
day, but it was wholly unprepared for
the magnificent message and man
that was sent to them. To say that
Dr. Williams is a great preacher is
but a faint conception of his versatile
ability. He is an orator, scholar and
elocutionist, and a singer par excel
lent and his dramatic fire and Ches
terfleldian poses simply carried his
audience by storm. Ho was deluged
by congratulations at the close of the
service and it is safe to say that every
one of his auditors out of a congre
gation of more than 1,200 whoever
has the opportunity to go to Birming
ham will be found hunting for the
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to
again have the opportunity of listen
ing to his matchless eloquence.
EBENEZER CHAPEL.
Saturday night ended tho Week's
Choir Carnival at the park. To say
that it was a grand affair is making
a mild compliment. Rev. Williams'
plan of tho affair brought together un
questionably tho most brilliant and

tho country. The selections rendered
wero from the' best composers and
rendition showed iard study and
faithful application on the part of both

McKINLEY'S WAR COST LESS,
bloodshed than wilson's
peace:
By Theodore Itoosevolt.
Under President McKlnley we had
a war with Spain. Under President
Wilson wo aro assured that wo have
had "peace" with Mexico. Those are
the words. Now for the deeds. Dur-
i lng the war with Spain fewer Amer
icans were killed by the Spaniards
than have been killed by Mexicans
during the present "peace" with Mex
ico. Let me repeat this. A greater
number of Americans have been killed
by Mexicans during theso years, when
wo uro officially informed that we
have been at peace with them, than
were killed by the Spaniards during
our entire war with Spain. Moreover
when the war with Spajn was through,
it was through. But peace still con
tinues to rago as furiously as ever in
Mexico. Nor is this all. The Instant
effect of the outcome of the war with
Spain was to put a stop to the dread
ful butchery and starvation in Cuba
and the Philippines on a career of
eighteen years of peace and prosper
ity such as they had never known
before in all their checkered history.
But during these three years of Mr.
Wilson's "peace," the Mexicans them
selves have been butchered by their
own bandits" steadily and without in
termission; and Mexican women and
children have died by thousands
probably by scores of thousands of
starvation, and of the diseases inci
dent to starvation. In other words,
Mr. McKlnley's war cost less peace ;i
and it reflected high honor on the
American people; whereas Mr. Wil
son's peace has been one of shame
and dishonor for the American peo
ple, and one of ruin and bloodshed
for tho Mexicans.

REV. J. W. HURSE, D. D.,
Pastor of St. Stephen's Baptist Church, and easily the most popular and
forceful preacherin the West, a real leader of his people and possessing
a degree of scholarship that Is surprising to those who have witnessed
his gradual advancement from obscurity to the heights which he has at
tained. Dr. Hurse had conferred upon him two years ago the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy by Dr. Johnson's famous school of Washington, D.
C, and as a slight recognition of his sterling worth and the magnificent
manner In which he so successfully handled the recent National Baptist
Convention, ably assisted by Dr. Beckham of Independence and Dr. Wil
liams of Westport, is to have conferred upon him next Sunday night the
degree of Doctor of Divinity from the Board of Directors of Conroe Nor
mal and Industrial College, located at Conroe, Texas, of which Dr. David
Abner Is the distinguished president. Dr. Hurse Is the founder and only
pastor of St. Stephen's Baptist Church, and. began the organization with
something like six members, which has now grown to an average Sunday
attendance of 1,100. When others complain of a scant attendance, St.
Stephens Is crowded to the doors. Why? The Gospel power and brave
leadership of Its pastor Is the answer.

Dr. Rufus S. Stout Leading the Move

Ground Breaking Sermon.
Winston-Salem, N. C, Sept. 14.
Last Sunday was a great day In
WInston-Salcra, a new epoch was
marked In the Negro Church life of
tho city, a new impetus was given
the religious and philanthropic activ
ities of the people. Dr. Rufus S.
Stout, Corresponding Secretary of
Church Extension of the Colored
Methodist Episcopal Church, came
here from Pino Bluff, Ark., in tho In
terest of his denomination. He
spoke with such eloquence and power
that he reached the hearts of the two
wealthiest men in the city, Mr. R. J.
Reynolds, tobacco king, and Mr. P. II.
Hanes, another multi-millionaire. Col.
Reynolds, after listening to this great
race leader, gave him two lots worth
$1,500 upon which to erect a fine C.
M. E. Temple and then gave five
thousand dollars to assist in . the
building. Dr. Stout is being praised
far and wide for securing this magni
ficent gift from one of the wealthiest
men in tho South. Mr. Reynolds pays
to the colored people of Winston
Salem, thirty thousand dollars per
week for labor in his mammoth tobac
co factories.
The ground breaking services for
tho new C. M. E. Temple were held
Sunday when Rev. J. Arthur Hamlett
of Jackson, Tenn., editor of the Chris
tian Index, official organ of the C. M.
E. Church, delivered the ground
breaking sermon from the subject,
"Holy Ground." Others who spoke
during the day were His Honor, the
Mayor Eaton; Drs. Boyer, McLarty
and Courtney of the white Methodist
churches; Col. Hanes, a multl-mllllon-aire;
Prof. Thompson, Mrs. Sills and
Mr. Cash. It was a great day in Winston-Salem
and Dr. Stout has added
another achievement to his already
brilliant history as a great race
worker.
MAYOR ROLPH IS GOOD SAMARI
TAN TO AFRICAN METHO
DIST 2ION CHURCH.
His Honor Lifts Mortgage for Organi
zation That Prayed for Him When
III. His Messenger a Member.
If Lemuel Harris, Mayor Rolph's
colored messenger, did not happen to
be a member of the African Methodist
Zion Church, it is probable that the
Church property would be sold at a
sheriff's sale next Tuesday. Up to a
few weeks ago the flock was led by
Rev. E. D. W. Jones. He left sudden
ly, leaving behind him two mortgages,
Interest payments overdue and a de
ficit in the Church treasury. Rev.
E. M. Clark succeeded Rev. Jones
coming to San Francisco from the
South. Rev. Clark, together with W.
W. Matthews, presiding elder of the
Church, vainly fought for funds. In
their search they called on the
mayor's messenger. The trio was
gloomily discussing the depleted fi
nances of the Church when Mayor
Rolph appeared. "Jsn't that your
Church, Lem?" asked the mayor.
'Yes, sir, I am honored by a mem
bership and my wife Is a stewardess."
'Was that tho congregation that pray
ed for me while I was in the hospi
tal?" "Yes, sir, it was." "Come to
my office this afternoon and I will
see that your indebtedness bothers
you no more," said the mayor. San

DOES THIS REACH YOU?
By BenJ. V. Longdon.
Doubtless you have learned the
value and necessity of warnings. For I
those who can hear there is the gong i
signal that announces that the train I
is coming! For those who can seel
there is the red signal light set up
over dangerous places in tho street or I
road. For sailors there is the buoy
bell and also the great lighthouse sig-!
nal that revolves constantly Inltsi
place. For those who live in civilized I
countries there is the weather bureau, 1
a government organization for the ,
purpose of making systematic metero
logical observations, forecasting the 1
weather and giving Information of the '
approach of storms, floods and the
like. All these provisions have been
made by men to save others from dan
ger and possible death. The informa
tion relating to the weather leads us !
to write in behalf of the delinquent!
subscribers of The Sun. Just now I
the weather forecast of the dally
newspaper or the warning flags of
the prophetic almanac impresses one
with the fact that heavy rains begin
ning this month are due throughout
autumn. Since It is customary to use
stories to illustrate teachings, wheth
er they are based on actual fact or
not we raise our warning to Its high
est level as we recalle tho story of
the man who got caught in a thunder
storm and crawled into a hollow log.
It Is said that the log, under the in
fluence of the dampness, swelled up
so that the man couldn't get out.
Thinking his time had come the sins
of his past life came before him.
Among them was the sin of his in
debtedness to the editor of his paper.
When he thought about how mean
this was he shrank up until he be
came so small that he crawled out
through, a knot hole and hurried to
the editor's office.
