ACARD, Wa
The resilt of this election was:
,practically foreordained but the
- campaign has been one of educa
- "tion and enlightet.ient and -the
good people of Evangeline and St.
Landry will profit at some future
time by the Isaous raised and the
questions discussed..
As for myself, I can not feel any
thing but gratitude and, affection
for those good men who espoused
my candidacy and who stood boldly
out in the open against tremendous
odds. The only way you can de
stroy entrenched power and polii
tical rings is to create public senw
timent that neither money nor of
ficial coercion can terrify.
Here in St. Landry the " peol'e
'are encircled with an unbroken
: ring, and from my observation auia
experience there is a link conaect
ing Evangeline.
I wish my opponent much s'i:
cess for the next four'years. Hie
. has both the opportunity and abi-.
ity to make good, and I see no rea
son to deter him from a strict per:
formance of his duty. Surely the
people have been good to hin -
giving him one-quarter of a cent
ury of office-holding, and he should
Sfeel sufficiently zrateful to tlure
both parishes a full meaQ iut" of
peace and tranquility.

A FRIEND TO AtINUI l.TURE
Has: Made A Financial Success of
A, State Fair in t he
SOUTH
In the sudden demise of Louis
N. Brueggerboff, which occurred a
" fortnight ago after a brief illness,
Louisiana loses one of. its staunch
est friendts to agriculture. As sec
retary of the state Fair Associa
tion since its establishment, to him
goes the credit for wonderful ac
complishments in the face of great
obstacles. :He was the indefatiga
ble champion of parish fair devel
opment in Louisiana, and -his. con
duct of the State Fair brought him
into intimate contact with our,
leaders in agricultural development
with whom it was ever his pleas
ure to eo-operate to the fullest ex
tent.
SHavij to his' credit the unusual
record pi p akinga :financial sue,
Bess of a .State fair in the South,
r.Bueaerhoff had log bieen re
sgarded as the fremost secretary-"
manager 'in. Southern fairdom.
The. who ,had the privilege- .of
see i-gim gd3 in the ardiuous
due faciid d tnot the opening of a
fad'F session, w'th a. multiplicity 'fi
d-tails to handle~.could. not but be
impressed wi:th; the exceptional
ability and character of tWe man.
Regardless of .ost and personal
effort,- he ever strove to keep the
Louisiana State Fair to the highest
standard in every .respeft. And'
the State is clearly his- debtor. in
building up tbe reputation of tlhe
fair and giving it. the enviable posi
tion it now ' holds. Annually he
added materiaflly to the equiphient
of the Fair and tits displays. He
sawe to it that constanitly increased
premiums each year awarded to
agricultural exhibits an, to 4.live
stok; ani isuch prestige w. dgained
in the latter line that the foremost'
breeders -of live stock tite country
over freely availed themselves ,of
the priyiege ..f exhibiting it the
Shreveport Fair:.
Though pggerhoff is no more,
his achievements live,an as timef
goes on will po eve everfincreasing
ly valuable t he farminig indus
tries ofL iisi a. As: indicative of`
how his townsmen :iprciate what`
he has done for, the city where the
fair is located and ..for his State,
Shreveport btasinets imen shave.
started to raise a suitable fountain
in his memo for plaicenmeut ion^1
the fair grouinds. The amount they-;
aim to provido--fivesthousand dol
lars--should .be materially aug.i-,
mented by popular subscription
from all over Louisiana. Modern

gladly be party, and we hojD thet

G. O. P. to Have Iteeognition in
Louisiana Is Advice from

The mandamus suit, asking that
tVie name of the Republican eandi
dates be placed `on the official bal
lot in the general election,. to be
held in November, -was decided in
favor of the :G. O. P., according to
advice received from Batdn Rouge.
Judge Ellis, who heard the suit, diJ
not go to: Batn Rouge to render
his opinion, but reports 'are that
the Judge notified the Mlerk of,

by. mail.
The opinion has not aE yet been
received, but 1it is unofficially
known that it is .favo ale to~d

AURAL FOLK ARE -
VERY ENTHUSIASTIC
Fair to Open on 4th and "lose on
8th of October--Committee Now
Very Busy
Thursday, October 5, is the open
ing diay of the parish fair of St.
Landry, which 'promises to be one
of the best attended -in this state,
as the fact that St.; Landry' wilf
have a fai' this yeaf has been be
fore the attention of the people
oeiumanonsly.
* Never before have the rural folk
takent so much interest in a parish
fair. It is. said by those informed
that., tie agricultural displays at
the flair to be held in October will
'equal, .if 'not exceed, those of any
parish fair'in the 'state. Last year
-there was not' .engugh room to dis
play half of the 'exhibits, but this
gear the ,promoters are ready. to
take care of any amount of produce
-and the like. There was but a
few weeks in whiob to make prep
arationu for our last, annual fair,
but it is differenttthis ygear, and
ithose .in harge have had ample;
time to make, all 'rrangements
necessaiy for that purpose.
Much credit is due President Lit
1tell and the several , committees,
who have worked uniringly in' or
d';r,- at St. Landry; might stage the
ýest individual parish fair in the
state`. A number of. prominent
t speakers, < versed in agriculture,
stock raising, -truck-growing and
other subjects -pertaining to farm
life will address farmers of this
parish, and which should be of nma
terial advantage to them.
