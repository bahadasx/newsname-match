FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE LONG TO BE REMEMBERED PRIMARY CONTEST THE BROAD
AX LOYALLY AND STEADFASTLY SUPPORTED COL. LOWDEN MARCHING ON TO A GLORIOUS VICTORY
WITH HIM. ON THE OTHER HAND THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE ADVOCATED THE NOMINATION OF STATE
SENATOR HULL AND URGED ITS READERS TO VOTE FOR HIM AS HE WAS SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY
TO COL. LOWDEN AND IT WENT DOWN TO DEFEAT WITH HTM WHICH AMPLY PROVES THAT THE
BROAD AX IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE.
GOV. EDWARD F. DUNNE RE-NOMINATED OVER WILLIAM B. BRINTON, SULLIVAN CANDIDATE, THE
PLOWMAN OF DIXON, ILLINOIS. THE PRESENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE RECEIVING MORE THAN ONE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIVE THOUSAND VOTES AS AGAINST SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND FOR HIS LEAD

CONGRESSMEN MARTIN B. MADDEN, JAMES R. MANN, WILLIAM W. WILSON, THE THREE PROMINENT
SOUTH SIDE CONGRESSMEN WERE RE-NOMINATED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.
SINCE THE SMOKE OF THE GREAT PRIMARY BATTLE HAS CLEARED AWAY ALL SIGNS INDICATE THAT
EITHER HON. MARTIN B. MADDEN OR HON. MEDILL McCORMICK WILL SUCCEED THE HON. JAMES
HAMILTON LEWIS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN 1918, IN CASE CONGRESSMAN MADDEN IS
CHOSEN FOR THAT HONORED POSITION EITHER HON. OSCAR DE PRIEST OR MAJOR ROBERT R. JACK
SON WILL SUCCEED HIM IN THE LOWER HALLS OF CONGRESS.
THAT STATE SENATOR GEORGE F. HARDING WILL BECOME THE NEXT SHERIFF OF COOK COUNTY IN
1918.

TRICT OF ILLINOIS. FOR THE THIRD TIME, MAJOR ROBERT R. JACKSON, HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
THE HON. SHADRACK BAILEY TURNER WAS DEFEATED IN HIS RACE FOR RE-NOMINATION FOR MEM
BER OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE FIRST SENATORIAL DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. UNCLE JOHN
GRIFFIN, ALDERMAN JOHN J. COUGHLIN AND ALDERMAN MICHAEL KENNA COULD NOT SAVE HIM
WITH THE UNDESIRABLE ELEMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RESIDING IN THE FD2ST WARD.
THE HON. ROY O. WEST, WHO HXs NO USE FOR COLORED NEWSPAPER EDITORS NOR FOR COLORED
PEOPLE IN GENERAL, UNLESS THEY ARE WILLING TO SERVE HTM IN THE CAPACITY OF SERVANTS
AND ASSIST HIM IN REMOVING OR PUTTING ON HIS LONG SILK STOCKINGS, MAY BE ELECTED TO
THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN 1960.
The long drawn-out primary contest
to secure the nominations for tho many
big offices and the rich pickings which
belong to them, in this state, has at
this writing almost become a part of
tho history of Illinois, leaving in its
trail many bitter disappointments and
much hard feeling and a very bad
taste in the mouths of those who went
down to defeat in the midst of tho
double crossing and the double deal
ings on tho part of many of tho boss
politicians on both sides of the politic
al fence and many of them have sev
ered friendships of long standing on
account of this double dealing and
double crossing and right at this time
it is well to remember that everything
is fair in "love, war and in politics."
It will be recalled that it was stated
in tneso columns several wccks ago,
namolv. that if the Hon. Charles S.
Denecn, who is very anxious to land in
the United States Senate in 191S, and
his supporters would have cast their
political fortunes with those of Col.
Frank I. Smith, that a far different
story would or could be writ
ten the morning after the primaries in
relation to its outcome and time has
proven that we were not far from be
ing correct in that respect. The very
fact that Messrs. Dencen, West and
Co. would persist in thrusting their
man Friday, state senator Morton D.
null, into tho three-cornered fight,
made it possible for Col. Frank O.
Lowden, after a long and bitter contest
to win tho nomination as the Republic-
. c it.:.
an canaiaaio ior governor ui iu
state, at the same time receiving moro
than one hundred thousand majority
over his two rivals, Messrs. Hull and
Smith.
The thing that pleases us most and
struck us with more force than any
thing else, is this that from the begin
ning to the end of the very long to be
remembered contest that The Broad Ax
loyally and more than steadfastly
stood by and supported Col. Lowden and
in tho end it had the honor of march
ing onto a most glorious and grand vic
tory with him. On the other hand tho
Chicago Tribune, which claims to be
tho "Greatest newspaper in the
world," nsido from tho Defender,
which was also filled with dead can
didates last week, strongly advocated
tho nomination of state senator Hull,
urging its readers with articles on its
front page to vote solidly for him as he
was in every way superior to Col. Low
den and it went down to defeat with
him which simply proves that The Broad
Ax is far more powerful than The Chi
cago Tribune, and the only man that
its readers and followers supported and
assisted to re-nominate was tho Hon.
Edward F. Dunne who received well
onto one hundred and fifty-five thou
sand votes as against sixty-five
thousand votes for his leading oppo
nent. William B. Brinton. the plow-
maker of Dixon, HI., and tho Roger C.
Sullivan candidate for tho nomination
for governor of Hlinois.
Hon. Lewis E. Stevenson, after, a
very hard fought battle received the
nomination for secretary of stato on
the Democratic end of it.
When tho ballots are all in and
counted the votes for the various Re
publican and Democratic candidates
seeking tho nomination for governor
will read something like as follows:
In tho whole state Republican F.
0. Lowden, 220,000; M. D. Hull,
110,000; F. L. Smith, 77,000; in Cook
County F. O. Lowden 76,000; M. D.
Hull, 49,000; F. L. Smith, 14,600.
In the wholo state Democratic E. F.
Dunne, 1.13,000; W. B. Brinton, 6,000;
James Traynor 21,000; in Cook County
E. F. Dunne, SS.000; W. B. Brinton.
30,000; James Traynor, 6,000
Hon. Mcdill McCormick received the
full benefit of tho landslide voto for
Col. Lowdea and was nominated for
Congressman at large, B. M. Chiper
field being his Republican associate for
Congressman at large, William E. Will
iams, the present Democratic Congress
man at largo was re-nominated and Jo
seph O. Kostner of thi" city will bo hi
running mate.
Hon. Harry B. Miller, who was high
ly recommended to the voter through
out this city and county for state's at
torney by The Broad Ax and bitterly
fought and severely condemned by the
Chicago Tribune which endeavored in
its weak way to land the nomination of
John E. Xorthup, won out against the
combined opposition of that newspaper
and the Hull-Wcst-Denccn forces, so it
pays after all to have Tho Broad Ax on
your side, not for one day or year, but
all the time.

of tho Sanitary District; Col. August
