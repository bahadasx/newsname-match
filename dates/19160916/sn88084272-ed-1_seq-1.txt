King Says Country Is Ready
to Join Entente When An
Advantage Is Apparent.
Tatoi. Greece. Sept. 16 Greece Is
ready to join the entente allies when
ever It appears to be In the best in
terests of Greece to do so. said king
Constantine to a correspondent of The
Associated Press at the king's summer
palace here The king refused to be
quoted directly regarding the policies
of Greece, but spoke with the utmost
frankness. t
The king expressed indignation that i
I 't could be thought by anyone, much
less be published that he is bound by
any pledge to anyone not to make war
or that he has been moved in hia course
hitherto by any reasons save those he
conceived to be lor tne greatest goon
of his country.
He referred with particular feeling
to the fate almost certain to overtake
nearly l.eM.M Greeks living in Asia
Minor and Thrace on the event of
Greece finding herself engaged tn hos
tilities with Turkey and he pointed oat
that while those who Judged Greece
and himself harshly for what is re
garded as Inaction they gave no
thought to the prospect of condemning
to the lot of the Armenians. Greek
women and children caught in the toils
of the Turks.
Criticises IIU Critics.
The king said the world regarded
with callousness, due to ignorance, the
real situation concerning the attitude
of Greece, criticising the country and
government for bargaining when the
Greeks alone could know and estisaate
the frightful cost of a war to Greece.
He lata stress on the difference be
tween Greece's situation and Rumania's
nt this respect.
Situation Has Changed.
Quite frankly the Mng admitted that
the presence of Balgarhuis in Mace-
denia and Rumania s entrv into the-
war would greatly complicate the situ
ation, constituting a new element
which easily might alter the premises
upon which the policy of Greece
hitherto has been based The king de
clared that all these new elements had
to be duly considered and weighed be-
iDS ber position, but he added that
. thoueht over and
that the cause of Greece would depend
on the result of that consideration and
on nothing else.
