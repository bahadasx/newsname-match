NEW VEHICLE OF WAR.
British Use Powerful Armored Auto
fn. Somme Drive.
/British Front hi 'France, Sept. 16.—
Aside front their increased artillery
flra in the great new drive on the
Somme' the British brought intq -actjon
for tte .ffwtvtim'e todayl a new type
of armored motor_car, capable- be
cause of its po^erfur'ftactioh of cross
lfeg tenches and shell craters. For
some days the army had watched with
Interest and curiosity, and today as it
moved along in support of the infantry
in their charges they cheered it, even
in the midst of shell fire.
There has been nothing more won
derful, even in this war, than the spec
tacle of its advance toward the Ger
man line.
The Britsh have built under cover of
closest secrecy a fleet of armed and
armored land dreadnoughts that will
plow thru trenches, wade deep riv
ers and sweep death in broad and de
vastating circles of twenty-mile ra
dius.
Driven by engines of tremendous
power, plated with six-inch steel, these
automobiles of extermination are arm
ed with big guns on pivots and di
rected by men in steel turrets.
There is no obstruction less than a
mountain that can withstand their ap
proach. They could batter thru a
building of granite foundation and
metal frame like a giant walking thru
a wheat field.
LOAN "NULL AND VOID."
of
Germany Discourages Advance
Money to Belgians.
Washington, Sept. 16. Ambassador
von Bernstorff today'' Informed the
state department that the German gov.
ernment would consider "null and
void" any loan to Belgium by the
United States during German occupa
tion of that country.
State department officials declared
they had no knowledge that the Belgian
government was seeking a loan in this
country. It announced Germany's po
sition, however, to protect American
bankers who might become interested in
such a loan. The position was summed
up as follows:
"The imperial government, thru Its
ambassador, has infqrmed the state de
partment that' in, view of statements
that the Belgian government is trying
to contract a loan in the United States
and has for this purpose disposed of
the Belgian state railroad, any such
arrangements made during the German
occupation and without previous con
sent of the German government will
be considered null and void by Ger
many."

whether it covers American goods al

British embassy officials say it does

VOLUME FORTY-TWO MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1916J
British Ffont in France, Sept. 16.—
Army officers universally ar5 speak
ing of Friday fis the best day, for the
British arijps sinceythe offensive be
gan on th*^ Somme front. With the
exception pf J[®ly 1, the attack begun
yesterday morning was the most ex
tensive in the ten weeks of the baittle.
For the first time new armored motor
cars of ingenious pattern, suitable for
crossing trenches and shell holes, com
peted with the infantry as the British
swept down toward the Bapaume. At
this writing the British are beyond the
village of Flers, which they took early
in the morning and are established at
Martlnpulch and Courcelette.
Heaviest Shell Fire in History.
The slow, plodding work of recent
weeks, which included the taking of
Ginchy and Guillemont, has for Its
object control of all the high ground
from the region of Thiepval to the
junction with the French on the right.
The Germans fought hard for every
foot of It. Delville or Devil's wood,
Highwood and the rib of earth which
the windmill crowned beyond Pozleres,
have been steeped with 'blood of men
fallen there In their long stand under
the heaviest orgy of shell fire In the
history of warfare, as German
wrestled with Briton, not for a piece
of farm land, but for military and
human mastery.
Attack Surprises Germans.
The British push yesterday was
largely down hill. They put behind
them the high ground whose slopes
give them shelter for their guns and
whose crests give them observation for
their artillery fire. Evidently the Ger
mans did not expect the attaok, con
sidering the drive was over and that
the British would settle down for the
winter.
Never before, probably, have, more
guns played over a single front than
along the six miles where the British
made their first advance on July 1. and
have continued to- the present. The
Germans kept on bringing up guns un
til now they have 1,000 In thifc short
sector. The Associated Press corre
spondent, movim? over the region of
the devastated villages and shell-torn
earth, saw on Thursday how enor
mously the British had increased their
own artillery.
Sun-tanned and weather toeaten were
ports Into neutral states contiguous to
Germany to provide them with such
stock of goods as they consumed before
the war, the British officials say, has
been in operation many months. They
say that when the maximum stock in
any country is reached no more letters
of assurance are given to Americans.
STUDY MEXICAN QUESTION.
American Coirfnrssioners Review Sub
jects to Be Discussed.
New London, Conn., Sept. 16.—The
American members of the American
Mexican joint commission seeking a so
lution of the international problem aris
ing from the Mexican situation, in the
absence of the Mexican commissioners,
studied today the subjects to be dis
cussed at the resumption of sessions
xt week.
Gen. T. H. Bliss, who pointed out to
the commission the necessity for border
protection by Mexican troops, in the
event American troops are withdrawn,
was called into the consultation.
It is believed 'unlikely that' the earlier
meetings of the commission will d^g.1
with this phase of the situation.

were firing with something of the

The gunners were soing on with

guns, which were going on with their
night shifts of gunners, whose figures
were illuminated by flashes. Except
for jfihe guns which know no rest, the
army seemed silent and asleep for the

Everybody and everything was in
place and ready including those
grotesque new- armored cars, which
were to have their baptism of Are in

their ear-racktng noise from daylight
to darkness and* from darkness to
dawn. Now and then the keys of that
strident piano, were struck in a chord.
When dawn came all the keys began
tb bang at once.
Only an hour before the time set for
the British attack, the Germans, who
had no idea "the British were comlns
on in another big push, made a small
attack in the neighborhood of Mauquet
farm. They iook a section of trench
and were folding it at the moment
when that wave of British, six miles
long, began to move. The British re
serves in that area swept over the
Germans and their own men who were
struggling wltfr the Germans, upon the
objective set Jf6r three days work.

MACHINISTS lAID
TO FAVOR STRIKE
Result of Ballot by Longshoremen,
Teamsters, and Coal Btfrge V/orkers
to Be Known Monday—Street Car
Officials Consider Appeal to Courts,
Charging Interference by Labor
Leaders.
New York, S»pt. 16.—Several trade
unions voted today for the purpose of
determining their response to the call
for a sympathetic strike to back up
the striking street car employes. By
Monday labor unions expect to learn
the sentiment of longshoremen, team
sters, tide wat«r boatmen, coal barge
men, stationary engineers and Bremen.
They assert 70,000 men will be called
out. The union leaders declare that a
majority of the members of the ma
chinists' union/'have voted to strike.
iShould the longshoremen, boatmen
and coal barge workmen go out the
strike leaders say virtually all work
along the water front will be tied up.
May Appeal to Courts.
While leaders were perfecting a
sympathetic strike, officials of the
street car company, against which the
fight is directed, discussed again today
the institution of action charging in
terference by labor leaders.
Business men and merchants vho
have suffered l*i« iitL-iivii ii«i-up
are said to be co-operating in the
movement to restrain the labor lead
ers.
Munitions Labor May Quit.
A plan for the announced purpose of
embarrassing "the Morgan interests"
was made public late yestlrday by
union leaders In charge of the local
traction strike. They stated that 70
per cent of about 13,000 machinist",
nvos-t of whom are working In plants
furnishing war munitions for the en
tente allies, had voted In a referendum
for a sympathetic strike in the in
trusts of the street railway employes.

Like prehistoric monsters they must
have seemed to the Germans, who had
to seek dug-outs or surrender.
So far as reports indicate tonight
the British everywhere gained posses
'sion of the new German trenches ex
cept opposite Ginchy. There the Ger
mans clung with desperate courage
and dog-to-bone tenacity to remain on
that bit of high ground. There he
clings at last accounts.
The work of the new armored cars
in co-operating with the infantry in
their charges in yesterday's success
ful attack is one theme of talk thru
out the army today.
"The idea was so good when it was
offered," said a staff officer, "that we
had some built and the way they have
gone over the German trenches and
have enlflladed them with machine
gun Are is some return for the surprise
the Germans gave us with their gas
attacks in the first battle of Ypres."
Evidently the British were able to
keep the building of these cars en
tirely secret and the first the Germans
knew of their existence was when in
the misty dawn they came trembling
across shell craters and over tree
stumps, cutting down small trees on
their way.
Look Like Battleship Turrets.
"Tanks" Is the slang word the army
staff has applied to these strange crea
tions of machinery, but they look less
like tanks than anything else in the
world. It is hard to say what they
look like. They have been compared
to armadillos and measuring worms,
and to many other weird creeping and
crawling objects of natural history. A
man of war's turret crossing fields in
and out of gulleys and thru fences
would present a spectacle resembling
their progress.
According to reports trenches full of
dead were left in their wake when the
occupants of trenches tried to hold
their ground and did not surrender or
fly from its approach. Yet destructive
as the fire of the "tanks" was. many
German prisoners began laughing
when -recalling the first glimpse of
them, while the, British recalled that
these grotesque comrades \pre laughing
over the day's victories.
The "tanks" have added a humor
which put the army into a festive
mood.
are the holders of the largest blocks of
the bonds of the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company, which with the New
York Railways Company, owned by the
Interborough, are involved in the trac
tion strike.
fPolice Commissioner Woods said late
yesterday he had received information
that the longshoremen of the city
would strike today.
According to union leaders the long
shoremen's union has a membership of
8,000. It was reported the men were
taking a referendum vote on the strike
and that 75 per cent had voted. Nine
out of every tne members, it was said,
had voted to strike.
A decision on the question of a sym
pathetic strike of 70,000 workers in
trades closely affiliated with the op
eration of the traction lines is expected
today. A referendum has been 1c
progress among many of the crafts for
several days, and if the sympathetic
strike is authorized, union leaders pre
dict, it will be the most effective blow
that could be dealt' in the carmen's
strike that has been in progress since'

NEW SHELL GREAT SUCCESS.
Pierces Thick Armor Plate and Tears
Thru Occupied House.
Washington, Sept. 16.—A 2,100 pound
shell from one of the new sixteen inch
naval guns recently pierced a thick
piece of armor plate, pas.ied thru a sand
bank, ricocheted, and tore thru a
helper's home, on the government's
proving reservation at Indian Head,
Md. The helper's family narrowly es
caped death.
Tu naval officers the remarkable
part of the test Is the piercing quality
demonstrated for the new shell. It was
among the first charges fired from the
new caliber rifles. A minimum charge
was used. These guns are being dem
onstrated prior to being set up on
dreadnaughts now building.
N'aval officers were jubilant yester»
day over the showing made by the new
gun in the clean sweep it had bored
thru every object It came in contact
with.
"With a full charge behind it," said
one officer yesterday, "the shell would
have pierced from five to teri Inches of
armor plate."
The sixteen Inch gun when mounted
on such ships as the Tenneswee, now
under construction, will be the largest
i'Srir. £f!c&t! The Innh nnn of
the British Queen Elizabeth and simi
lar ships are at preaent the greatest
firearms oh the mb.
The recent accident at Indian Head
is not the first. With the use of the
sixteen inch guns, however, the navy
hus decided it will be necessary to
secure a new range.
