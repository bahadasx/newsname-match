Three Towns and Two Woods Fell Into the Possession of the
British The Germans Under Crown Prince Rupprecht
of Bavaria Fought Stubbornly to Hold Their Ground
Aiding the British in Encircling Combles, the French
Have Taken Additional Trenches North of Le Priez Farm
In Northern Macedonia the British, French and Serbian

Wing The Italians Have Becun s N Drive Toward
Triest.
Smashing: the German line on a
front of six miles north of the Somme,
in France, the British forces have
made probably the most notable ad
vance since the Anglo-French offen
sive began July 1.
Three towns, two woods and the
posession of nearly all the high ground
between Combles and the Pozieres
Bapaume road fell to the British. Not
snly did the Germans lose these points,
but the British drive imperils the
Combles and Thiepval positions, at
either end of the British front. The
gaining of the high ground north of
Combles gives the British command of
the approaches to Bapaume.
The advance on the northern end
of the front was for a distance of two
miles. Courcelette, east of Thiepval,
and north of the Pozieres-Bapaume
road and MartinpuicH, south of the
road, fell into the hands of General
Haig's men. Farther south they took
Fers and the High "Wood, making se
cure their possession of Ginchy. The
Bouleaux Wood, north of Combles, al
so was lost to the Germans.
The Germans under Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria fought stub
bornly to hold their ground,. London
says, 8nd the fighting was severe all
along the line. More than 2.300 pris
oners were taken by the British.
Aiding the British in the encircle
ment of Combles, the French have
taken additional trenches north of Le
Priez farm. South of the river three
German trenches near Berny-en-San-terre
were taken by the French, who
also rotured 200 prisoners."
Kerhn claims the repulse of British
attacks southeast of Thiepval and of
French efforts between Rancourt and
the Soirjse. The official statement
admits the loss of Le Priez farm, west
of Rantourt.
In northern Macedonia the British,
French and Serbian armies have
pained additional successes, breaking
down the Bulgarian defense in the )
center and on the left wing. French
troops took Bulgarian positions a half
mile deenl on a front of one mile. West
of Lake Ostrovo the Serbians captur
ed Malkanidze. The British attacked
west of the Vardar and also gained
ground.
Unofficially, it is reported the Bul
garians retreated twelve miles in
front of the entente rush and Athens
reports the abandonment of Kastoria
by the Bulgarians. Berlin says en
tente attacks in the Moglenica sector
and east of the Vardar were repulsed.

IMPERATIVE NEED OF
INLAND WATERWAYS
Pointed Out by Secretary Daniels and
Admiral Benson.
Philadelphia, Sept. 15. The impera
tive need of a great system of inland
waterways and coastal canals which, in
addition to providing commercial ad
vantages, would be of inestimable mil
itary value in time of war, was point
ed out by Secretary Daniels of the
navy department and Admiral Benson,
chief of naval operations, in addresses
before the members of the Atlantic
Deeper Waterways association at the
Philadelphia navy yard today. ' The
ability of submarines to traverse these
inland canals and of battleships to find
a haven there in case of invasion was
cited by both, speakers as one of the
greatest arguments in favor of the es
tablishment of the system.
Secretary Daniels promised the dele
gates the earnest and enthusiastic co
operation of the navy department in
any practical plan looking to the im
provement of the inland waterways
along the coast, while Admiral Benson
declared the value of such a system
from both an economic and military
point of view was sufficient to Justify
a bond issue to help pay the cost of
construction. While Mr. Daniels was
speaking a hydroaeroplane flew up the
river. Noticing It, he said:
"I can never be happy unless we
have at least ten aeroplanea to each
battleship."
The waterways association, which Is
advocating the completion of the in
land waterways from Massachusetts to
Florida, elected officers at the final
session tonight.

A CONSTABULARY FORCE
FOR BORDER DUTY
Discussed at Session of American
Mexican Joint Commission.
New London, Conn., Sept. 15. A
suggestion that the Mexican govern
ment create a constabulary force for
border duty similar to the rurales of
the Diaz regime was made today dur
ing the brief session of the American
Mexican Joint commission in conclud
ing the second week of its delibera
tions. Apparently the plan for a Joint
police force previously discussed was
abandoned "as unkorkable after the
commissioners had conferred at length
with Major General Tasker H. Bliss,
"assistant chief of staff of the United
States army.
The three Mexican commissioners
left for New York tonight to join in
the celebration of the Mexican Na
tional holiday there tomorrow which
has been arranged by consular offi
cials. Dr. John R. Mott of the Ameri
can commission is absent on personal
business, but his associates, Secretary
Lane and Judge Gray, are here de
voting much time to a study of tele
graphic reports from the border and
the interior of Mexico, transmitted
from the state and war departments.
General Bliss, it, was learned tonight,
made to the joint commission today a
dispassionate statement of the situa
tion which would result if General
Pershing's forces were withdrawn
from Mexico before a, properly consti
tuted constabulary had been created
to relieve them. He explained the
military situation along the border
and outlined the disposition of Mexi
can forces now in the border region
as it is known to the war department.
It is understood he pointed out the
problems that would arise if an effort
to create a border police under dvial
authority were undertaken.

A Never Ceasing Servant
"We know that advertising has produced quantity of production
and more raipid selling, making labor-saving machi.-.iy and other
economies possible," said a recent advocate in Chicago, "and that it
has reduced the cost of everything that has been judiciously adver
tised and otherwise properly handled. We know that advertising
has placed wide markets within the quick and easy grasp of those
who have meritorious things for the public and we know that many
an article which requires a wide market to make its manufacture
possible at all, would not exist were it not for advertising."
Such is the experience of those who have made consistent use
of printers' ink. What It has done for others it will do for you, and
in this part of Connecticut there is no medium which renders such
advertising service as The Bulletin. It is a tireless servant.

OF SMOKELESS POWDER
Nineteen Workmen Burned in Dupont
Powder Plant at Carney's Point, N. J.
Wilmington, Del., Sept. 15. Nine
teen powder workers were burned, at
least six of them seriously, by the ex
plosion of several thousand pounds of
smokeless powder at the plant of the
Dupont Powder company at Carney's
Point, N. J., tonight.
The flames originated in a blending
tower in what is called the finishing
area and while the company has not
established the ' cause, the .opinion is
advanced that a piece of metal may
have found its way into the powder
which was being worked through the
tower.
Following the first big flare which
lighted up the country for miles
around, there were several smaller
ones as fresh bins of powder in the
towef became ignited.
All the workmen were in the blend
ing tower, but when a small sheet of
flame shot up all made their escape
through the safety chutes. They
were burned while fleeing from the
building. The tower was destroyed
in a few minutes.

Trolley Cars Were in Collision in The Bronx and Four
Persons Were Injured Crowds Swarmed the Elevated
Railway Platforms and Several Women Fainted in the
Crush Transit Points on Surface Lines Were Scenes

sult of Vote on Sympathetic Strike Will be Made Known
Today.
New York, Sept. 15. Action on the
question of sympathetic strike of
70,000 workers in trades closely affil
iated with the operation of New York's
traction lines was expected to be tak
en within a few hours. A referendum
has been in progress among many of
the crafts' for several days and it was
said the complete vote would be an
nounced soon, possibly tonight. If the
strike is authorized, union leaders pre
dict, it' will be the most effective blow
that could be dealt in the strike which
has been in progress since Sept. 6
on the elevated, subway and surface
transportation lines of the city.
The only craft upon which figures
figures were available tonight was
the machinists and it was said that
the vote in that trade showed about
70 per cent, of the membership fav
oring a sympathetic strike.
Union leaders attach much import
ance to the action of the machinists,
most of whom are employed in plants
manufacturing munitions of war for
the entente allies.
The effect of the strike in that trade
they say, would be a direct blow at the
Morgan interests, the largest holders
of stock in the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company. J. P. Morgan and
Company are the fiscal agents of the
British government in this country.
Several persons were, injured, none
of them seriously, in two traction ac
cidents tonight. The most serious was
a rear end collision between two trains
on the Third Avenue Elevated line a
short distance from the Fifty-ninth
Street station."." Fassehgersr-were'hTirl-led
from their seats and many suf
fered severe injuries. Downtown
POLITICAL SITUATION IN
GREECE IS TURBULENT
Dimitracopulos Has Been Unable to
Form a New Cabinet.
Athens, Sept. 14, 6.30 p. m., via
London, Sept. 15, 9.35 p. m. The in
ability of Former Finance Minister
Dimitracapulos to form a cabinet as
requested by the king is believed by
the Venizelists and anti-Venizelists
alike to have been due to the belief
that he intended to build up a per
sonal political party. His assurances
that he would do his best to bring
Greece into the war do not seem to
justify the price demanded by the en
tente, who asked a free hand in Greek
internal politics and immediate elec
tions despite the evident difficulties
in the way of such a course.
The political situation is still very
much involved.

as a result of the accident.
Two trolley cars were in collision in
The Bronx and four persons, one a
patrolman on strike duty, were in
jured. It is said the cars were being
operated by strikebreakers.
Although surface car service was
much improved over that of previous
days, subway and elevated traains
were more crowded today than at any
time since the strike was called. This
was explained in part by rain during
the late afternoon, which sent ,many
pedestrians to the transportation lines.
Crowds swarmed the elevated rail
way platforms and one station was
closed for a time until the trains
bear away the people already inside
the gates. Several women fainted in
the crush and many persons suffer
ed minor bruises in the scramble to
get aboard trains. Additional police
were called to handle the crowds in
many instances. Transfer points on
surface lines were scenes of great
congestion during the evening rush
hours.

ed inquiry into the strike today. A
statement issued with regard to the
situation on the Third Avenue Rail
road lines said there was no evidence
of bad faith on the part of the cpart
of the company or any indication that
it was the company's Intention to vi
olate the agreement of August 7

strike. The commission added that it
did find evidence of suspicion on the
part of the men

once and the agreement of August 7
