Rerord Breaking Crowds and Best Exhib
its Makes This Year's Free Fair
Best in County's History
MANY INTERESTING
FEATURES NOTED
One of Most Creditable Affairs in History
of County Draws to Close With
Attractions Still Open
With a record attendance and a
plane of excellence seldom attained by
county events, the Grady County Free
Fair closed its second annual show to
night. Not since the opening day has
interest flagged nor has the attend
ance dropped off at any time, the
crowds lingering until long after sun
down in their inspection of the splen
did exhibits.
Excitement at "Bantie" Coops.
One of the liveliest parts of the
grounds this year was the poultry de
partment at the time of the distribu
tion of the premiums. W. W. Rossin.
ger, superintendent of. that depart
ment, believes that every boy m
Chickasha had bantams on exhibit but
as the records show that only 100 of
these game little birds were entered
his guess is a little bit wild. But be
that as it may it seemed that few boys
stayed at home about the time the
awards were handed out and the boys
went wild with excitement as the
judges approached with each succes
sive blue- or red ribbon. The most
youthful exhibitor was not the least
demonstrative. Ho was R. M. Sperry,
the three-year-old grandson of Super
intendent ' Rosainger, and ho, insisted
upon detaching the blue ribbon from
the coop in which his prize hen was
housed and placing it on his little
dress.
"The birds a this show were muc'i
better than those, which were exhibit
ed here a year ago. The Plymouth
Rocks, especially, were far superior
to those of last year and the magnifi
cent display of Leghorns was better
than was ever shown here before.
Plenty of interest was manifested
both by the exhibitors and the general
public."
y Some Beautiful uunts.
Naturally euough most of .he ladies
who visited the fair paid special at
tention to the display of quilts, better
than which it would be hard to find
in any collection. Especially merito
rious and which was awarded the blue
ribbon was that shown by Mrs. Van
Fosseu, residing at 1223 Colorado ave
nue, which created quite a sensation.
It was appllqued work with a wild
rose pattern of so superior workman
ship that it easily won first honor
among many handsome competitors.
Mrs. Van Fossen is over seventy years
old.
Another lovely speciment in this de.
partment was that of Mrs. E. C. Peary
consisting of a crocheted and embroi
dered luncheon cloth and several
pieces which took first prize in their
class.
An oddity which attracted the curi
ous was the silk crazy quilt entered by
Mrs. C. C. Farris of Tuttle which was
started in 1900 and has only recently
been completed. This contains the
names of many American notables
presidents and prominent persons of
Chickaslia.
In this section of the textile depart
ment the children's contributions were
odd and beautiful.
Though all chil- j
dren between the ages of ten and six
teen years are eligible ho exhibitor
was over fourteen. A doll set, by an
eight-year-old lass, handwork, and con
sisting of gown and cap cryheted,
yas one of the most admired pieces of
work in the building.
Rebecca Williams, aged ten, and
Gladys Heckel of Cbtrkas-ha, aged
ten, won recognition with their em
broidery work, while Leonard Good,
used six. gained fame by exhibiting a
cross-stitched sampler.
M.R w. E. Estes, who is over 80, j
exhibited a piece of beautiful work in j
knitting, being ? Pir of 0,(1 time ;

Federal Agricultural Experts Say Township

MAGNIFICENT IS
AGRICULTURAL SHOW
F. F. Ferguson Has Judged Eight County
Fairs in Oklahoma This Year but
None Approaches Grady
Highly, complimentary to President
YV. E. Smith of the Fair association
and to O. C. Cooper, manager of the
Farm Bureau, was the judgment of the
federal expert, F. F. Ferguson, dis
trict agent of the department of agri
culture, who judged the agricultural
sections of the fair.
"I have judged seven or eight agri
cultural exhibits at the county fairs
in Oklahoma this year," he said today,
"but I have not so far seen any agri
cultural display in the state that has
approached this one at the Grady
County Free Fair. In fact it is the
best by all odds.
"The township booths were positive
ly the best I have ever seen in the
Btate of Oklahoma. Being a resident
of Minco I was not .eligible to judge
the township displays but it was a
toas-up as to which was superior. The
Judging of these was a very difficult
proposition, they were so nearly equal.
I believe we have the best chance that
ve have ever had to pull down first
money at the state fair in Oklahoma
City with our township displays and
again I would congratulate the men
who were responsible for the magnifi
cent'' showing which has been made."
Tuttle township display was award
ed the first prize.,,,

the hotel one of the most modern and
up-to-date in the state. Ct-ment floors
will be put in the basement which will
be enlarged for more commodious
sample rooms. The first floor will be
concreted where it is not already so
constructed.
Every room in the building will be
provided with hot and cold water and
steam heat and the latter will call for
enlarging the heating system. The
contract also calls for nine new pri-

It was also stated upon good author

Important Raid Made by U. S. Deputies
Dillon and Worley on Restaurant
in Business Section
A bootlegging joint conducted in the
heart of the city was uncovered this
morning by Deputy U. S. Marshal Jim
Dillon and Dick Worley by the merest
chance. Deputy Dillon had gone to
the Rock Island station to meet his
fellow officer who was on the way t.
Duncan, ' Coming up from the station
they saw a man enter the small res
taurant and cider joint conducted by
A. C. French on the east side ot Sol's
building opposite to the Speake hotel
on Chickasha avenue. This aroused
the suspicion of the two men and Dil
lon suggested a raid and made a run
on it, surprising the inmates. Imme
diately on entering the building the
officers were assured by French that
he had no weapons ou the premises
and a search of 'his person revealei
nothing. A minute inspection of the
premises, however, revealed the pres
ence of two loaded six-shooters lying
near the bed which the raiders took
charge of. Uncovering a hole in the
floor twenty-two quarts of whiskey
were found. Both man and whiskey
were seized and French was lodged in
jail. Then Worley returned to his
train.
Returning to the place later in com
pany with Officer Jack Marshall, Dep
uty Dillon with a fcrowbar tore up the
floor and sixteen more quarts of
whiskey and a number of empty bot
tles furnished additional evidence
against French. About that time Coun
ty Attorney Venable and Deputy Sher
iff Bob Castleman happened along and
ordered the place closed. Two wo
men, claiming to be cousins of French,
were found and promised to leave
town to avoid arrest ;.
A raid was subsequently made on
the home of French on South Fourth
street but nothing was found on the
grounds.

President Smith Says Grady County Out
did Herself in Arrangement of Best
Fair on Record
lilllIIIU I Illi'
ARE INADEQUATE
Could Have Used 300 Instead of 140
Stalls and Permanent Stalls are
Necessary
Highly gratified with the unprece
dented success of the J10 Grady
County Free Fair and filled w ith plans
and ambitions for the future, Presi
dent W. E. Smith gave voice to his
views and sentiments today after the
fair had been unanimously pronounc
ed to be an unqualified success. Not
only praise due for the intelligent and
i diligent labors of his co-workers but n
timely criticism on the one weak spot
of the great event prompted his ob
servations. "This undoubtedly has in many re
spects been tho greatest and most suc
cessful fair ever held In Grady count.
Not having been in the presidency but
a few days I cannot take to myself any
credit for its excellence which is due
entirely to the efforts of the other
members of the board and to O. C.
Cooper, county demonstrator. As
president of the association I desire
to extend my thanks to all those who
labored for the success which it has
achieved and to the exhibitors who
have uncomplainingly put up with any
inconveniences which might have been
suffered by them due to inadequate
accommodations.
, "And in passing I wish to say that
if Chickasha and Grady county would
avail themselves of the golden oppor
tunity which is before them of making
Grady county fairs events which peo
ple will come miles to see, some im
provements must be made. In the
first place we must provide. for ade
quate , accommodations for live stock
exhibits. The entries this year were
the best ever seen in Chickasha and
some of the My? stock was as fine as
will bei shown at any fair In Oklaho
ma. We had only 110 stalls and could
have used 300. Exhibitors demand
quality when it comes to showing oft
their prize cattle and horses and other
good stock and are not content with
the big tops. They require perma
nent stalls and these will have to be
provided if Chickasha hopes to get the
best in the future. Under conditions
prevailing this year many of the stock
men had to sit up all night watching
their animals to prevent them from
tearing down barns and demolishing
petitions.. This would all be avoided
by the erection of permanent stalls.
Everybody was in the best of humor,
however, and beds were shared by
those who had provided them with
those who did not anticipate the ne
cessity for bridging them to the
grounds.
"The premium lists amounted to
S MOO this year and although the fig
ures on other expenditures are not
available I am quite sure that they
came within the appropriation and the
funds at hand."
