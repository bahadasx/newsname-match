affirms has "an effect con­
trary to neutrality, since the Swedish
naval forces would hesitate to attack
a German submarine in Swedish waters
under the pretext that it might be a
commeAsial submarine, whereas there
would be no similar hesitation in deal
ing with a submarine of the allies be
cause they have no commercial sub
marines.'*'
The note deals with a number of
questions relative to navigation and
concludes:
"The attitude adopted by the Swed
ish government Is at variance in ob
vious respects with an attitude which
is compatible with the duties of a
loyal and impartial neutral."
Great Britain and Sweden have been
at odds since the early period of the
war, and Sweden's unyielding attitude
evidently haq resulted In a decision
to exert the combined pressure of all
the entente allies on her. Difficulties
arose from the allied blockade of Ger
many, resulting in the holding up of
goods en route to Sweden which were
suspected to be destined for Germany.
Sweden retaliated by holding up large
quantities of parcel post matter in
transit between England and Russia.
This led to an exchange of notes
which accomplished nothing, and early
this month a deadlock was reached.
Great Britain insisted as a condition
to submitting the dispute to arbitra
tion that Sweden must promise not to
interfere again with English mail mat
ter. Sweden declined and the Swedish
minister at London went to the con
tinent, to be gone for several weeks.
Negotiations were transferred to
Stockholm but the latest advices from
London were that no solution of the
problem was in sight.
SWEDEN RETALIATES.
Berlin, Sept. 15.—A Stopkholm dis
patch to the Overseas News agency
says that Sweden has held 10,000 tons of
ooffee destined for Finland, presumably
on account of the fact that Great Brit
ain has detained shipments for coffee
for Sweden. As a result there is a
great sciu'city of coffee in Finland.

by the Philippine government upon

TURKS TO PERMIT

Washington, D. C., Sept. 15. —The

for consent to ship relief supplies for
the starving populations of Syria
through their blockade of Turkey. Yes*

reconsidered its former refusal to al

October '21 and 22 have been desig

YET UNSOLVED
Obstacles Have Arisen to
Spoil Tentative Plan
of the Mediators
New London, Conn., Sept. 15.—Prac
tical obstaoles have arisen in the con*
sideration by the American-Mexican
Joint commission here of numerous
suggestions for the .pacification of the
border, which makes' it seem improb
able at this time that any agreement
can be formulated without prolonged
discussion. MaJ. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss,
assistant chief ol staff of the army,
was before the commission today to
point out objections that can be raised
to many of the proposals, including
that of an international constabulary
to relieve the military forces of both
countries or the border patrol work
they are now doing.
The commission held only a brief
session, the Mexican party planning to
leave for New York today to attend
the celebration there tomorrow of
Mexico's national holiday commemor
ating the declaration of her independ
ence and the throwing off of Spanish
rule. They will return Monday when
the conferences will be resumed.
While the attitude of Gen. Bliss as
expressed to the commissioners here
has not been revealed, it is believed
he shares the views of many army of
fleers that no satisfactory solution of
the border situation can be found that
Is not based upon the establishment
and maintenance of a stable govern
ment In Mexico.
There is no doubt that one ol the
purposes of the Washington adminis
tration is to arouse Mexico to the mor
al obligation that it is felt'rests upon
her to protect American interests
eilong the international line from depre
dations of Mexican bandits. For this
reason it seems unlikely that any plan
for policing the border will prove ac
ceptable that seems to relieve her of
that responsibility.
Election in Mexico
Mexico City, Sept. 15.—Gen. Cais
ranza's purposes in issuing last
night a call for the election of dele
gates to an assembly to consider
changes in the constitution are tfet
forth in the preamble of the decree
now made public here. The preamble
refers to the platform of the consti
tutionalists as set forth in the Plan of
Guadalupe, adopted in 1913 before the
downfall of Gen. Huerta, and elaborat
ed at Vera Crus In 1914, and says It
sho^rs clearly that the program of the
constitutionalists provided that when
their cause was triumphant and muni
cipal elections had taken place the
first chief should call for the election
of a congress, gfrve an account of his
administration and have his actions
ratified or modified by the congress.
He was then to call a presidential elec
tion and turn over the executive power
to the legally elected president.
The fl*»t chief always intended to
carry out this program, and to that
end adopted various measures to pro
vide government of and for the people,
to improve the economic situation of
the working classe sand to Insure a
correct application of republican prin
ciples as embodied In the constitution.
Flays Hit Opponents.
"The enemies of the constitutional
ists," Gen. Carran?a asserts, "have
omitted nothing to prevent completion
of the program, even going so far as
to imperil the dlfrnity of the republic
and endanger its sovereignty by pro
voking conflict with a neighboring re
public, seeking to bring about inter
vention on the* pretext that there was
no protection for the lives and proper
tips of foreigners. They even pretend
ed to seek intervention for humanitar
ian considerations, appearing to la
ment the shedding of blood in a neces
sary war, although they did not
scruple to squander lives and permit
all manner of excesses against natives
and foreigners."
These enemies of the constitutional
ists oppose not only the reforms al
ready effected but those in prospect.
Therefore, the preamble says, the only
way in which to attain the desired
ends is to provide for a constitutional
assembly through which the whole
country will be aMe to express clearly
its sovereign will, putting the govern
ment on a firm basis beyond all ques
tion of legality.
Gen. Carransa says further that the
reforms projected are not intended to
lead to the establishment of a dictator
ship. The only purpose is to purge the
constitution of defects In the way of
obscurity and contradiction, or of
clauses inserted for the purpose of nul
lifying democratic rights.
The election of delegates to the con
stitutional assembly will be held Octo
ber 15. Business sessions will-begin
December 1 and will be limited to
two months. As soon as the constitu
tion is adopted, a presidential election
will be arranged and the assembly
will be dissolved.
ARMOR PLANT IS

Washington, D. C., Sept 16. The
navy department today faced the
task of choosing from among the 125
cities and rural districts offered as
sites for the new $11,000,000 govern
ment armor plant one which will best
serve
the navy's needs and be most
secure from attack in time of war.

SCOPE OF STREET CAR
STRIKE TO BE EXTENDED
Sympathetic Action By Other New
York Unions Seems Certain Set
tlement Hope* Dim.
New York, Sept. 15. —Although
union leaders have virtually abandon
ed hope of Mayor Mitchel and the pub
lic service commission bringing about
an amicable adjustment of the differ
ences between the striking street rail
way men and their employers, the be
lief was strong in official circles today
that some action would be taken with
in the next twenty-four hours to avert
the threatened sympathetic strike of
70.000 trade unionists.
The Central Federated uniop of Man
hattan will hold a special meeting to
consider the advisability of Joining in
a strike that "will astound New York."
The Brooklyn Central Labor union,
comprising ninety-five looal unions,

strike.

anew. From midnight until early to
day Sixth and Ninth avenue elevated
trains were bombarded with missiles.

of credits from as many American In
stitutions depositing to the account of
Knut Bagge amounts varying from
86 500 to 150,000 kronen.
