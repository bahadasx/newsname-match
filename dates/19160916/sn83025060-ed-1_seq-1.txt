M'KINLEY'S WAR COS? LESS
BLOODSHED THAN WILSON'S PEACE
By Thcodoie Roosevelt.
Under l'reldeht McKlnley we
had ii uiir with Spain. Under
President WlNiin we arc assured
Hint we h:ie had "peace", with
.Me.slco. These nro the words.
Now for the deeds. Iurln the
win with Spain fewer Aincilcnn
were, killed hy the HpiiulimN
than have heen killed hy Mel
cans during the present "peace"
with .lo.lco. Let me repeat
this. A ki eater ntimher of Anur
leans have heen Hilled hj
Meeans during these years
when we are otlleJull Informed
that wo have heen at peace with
them, than were killed hy the
Spaniards during our entire wai

war with Spain was through. It
" was thion h. I Ii 11 peace still con

all. The liiMuut effect of the
outcome of the war with Spain
was to put a stop to tlm-ilt-oiid-fill

GUARDSMEN PAY THE PRICE
OF WILSON'S ABASEMENT.
Having condoned the repeated
murders of Americans by the
Carranzl6tas, and having abased
hlmcelf before Carranza, and
having aided In placing Cnrrnn
za In power, what is Mr. Wil
son's reward? and who pays it?
The reward Is that fylr. Wilson
has to place 150,000 troops on
,the border to partially prevent
the raids and murders that his
friend Mr. Carranza will not or
cannot prevent; and the pay.
nicnt Is made by the aoldlcrs
'who are slain and by the fam-
lies of the guardemen who go
n want because thclrhu&bnnds
ind fathers have been called to
thc border to make good Mr.
Wllcon's refusal to let the rcgu.
lar army administer such punish
ment to the bRiUMts as to Inspire
In them a healthy fear. From
