GRABS $50 IN BANK
FOR ILL WIFE; RUN
Thief's Onlv Effects Pawn I
Tickets for Wedding Ring'
and a Bed Spread.
Fifty dollars seemed such a fot
tune to William llrennan, a penniless,
workless man whose solo possessions
of any tangible value were two pawn
tickets, one for his wife's wedding
ring and another for n bedspread lie
had pledged for tlilrty-seven cents,
that ho stole It this afternoon from n
depositor who was counting it in the
Battery Park National Bank, In tho
Produce Kxchaagc.
Brcnnan wan raptured, of eourse,
beeaupo u mob took after him us
soon n the cry was raided, and pur
sued him to the Battery. The money
was recovered, too, by u man who
ran abreast of him and demanded it
with n threatening hand at his hip
pocket.
But Brcnnun's theft and flight
yielded him something after all u
dollar bill which was given tn him
by Acting I'.ipt. leevy of the Dotoe
ttve Bureau when he told his slur)
and his reasons for the theft at l'o
llee Headquarters.
Brennan, who Is twenty-three years
old, and lives at No. 173 Do Kulu
Avenue, Brooklyn, has been out of
work for several weeks and also nut
of food. His wife. 111. about to be-
romn a mother, ban the more keenly
felt tho need of food, and it was for
her that tho wedding ring and the
bedspread, their last things of value,
were pawned.
With thejio things gone and work
unobtainable, Brennan wandered Into
the. bank Jhls afternoon, possessed
with some desperate Idea of benefit
ting thlnga for his wife. When he
saw Bertram tJumpert, tr usurer of
tho H. (lumporl Company, of the Bush
Terminal Stores, counting a pile of
money Just drawn at the paying
telllor'M window Ids only thought was
to grab some of It and run. Hn did
It, and. with "Stop thief!" ringing
after him, fled down Broadway ahead
of the growing crowd 'mil Into Bat
tery Park, where Policeman Mury of
Headquarters easily caught him,
Acting Captain Doevy sent l)e.
tectlve Franklin to Brcnnan's home
to verify his story and to bring Mrs,
Brennan to Headquarters, If the Jour
ney were possible for her.
Who the man was who took the
money from Bremian's hand and n
turned it to the police was never
learned.

LONGSHOREMEN EXPECTED

The right of the members of a union to go on a symapthetic strike,
although bound in a contract with their employers, signed by a union
oliicer, is to be tested as soon as the proposed general strike in aid j
the car men is declared. This course of ac.ion was decided upon to-day
by forces interested in heading off the industrial paralysis which, would
result from such a strike as the street ar union leaders plan. 1
The union leaders say they will not call strikes la trade hoMiac
contracts which provide that before a sympathetic strlko It declared tBcrt
must lie a conference between tho employers and the national oBcert t
tho union. These contracts, It would appear, prohibit the union frrt
