. The British brought Into action for
the first time in their big drive a new
type of armored motor car. capable, be
cause of Its powerful traction, of cross
ing trenches and shelling craters.
For some days the army had watched
it with interest and curiosity, and as It
moved along In support of the Infanttry
In their charges, they cheered It even
In ,tha midst ot shell fire. '
There has been nothing more wonder
ful, even In this war. than the spectacle
of Its advance toward the German line.
It seems to have played an Important
part In the sweep forward.
"We employed for the first time a
bw type ot heavy armored car which
nroved of considerable utility."
Behind this sentence from Hall's re
ports Is an Interesting story of the Initial
charge of war's modern cavalry. P'or
some time people have been waiting for
Just this news, but the present big thrust
furnished the first opportunity to test
the car traveling forh In a major opera
tion. The topography of the country over
which the action Is being waged per
mits these cars to dash down a gentle
slope, plow through hedges, and even
to hurdle narrow ditches and mounds.
They aer extremely mobile.
The Duke of "Westminster has used
armored cars with success In Egypt and
they are also not new on the East
front, but this Is believed to be the
first time they have been employed dur

When It Is remembered that a large
proportion of casualties are Inflicted by
machine guns during a charge the value
or the armored gun destroying mitrail

Whether they wll eventually sun
