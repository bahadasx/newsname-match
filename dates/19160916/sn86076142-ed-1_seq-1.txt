George, British secretary for war,
gave tbe Associated Press the follow

"The appears to be a deliberate
campaign, nt Jm foot In the United
States by German agents, to throw
doubt on tbe good faith of his majes
ty's government In regard to the use
of information obtained through the
censorship.
"These German agents appear now
to have resurrected my statement in
the House of Commons on August 8,
although that statement was fully
explained by Lord Robert Cecil, min
ister of war, on August 9, and most
explicit assurances on the same sub
ject were given by him In a later
Interview on August 15.
"In spite of all this, the propa

ing Lord Robert Cecil's assurances
which followed it. Let me now say
on behalf or the military authorities
that when information is passed on
by censorship to other departments
it Is for the sole purpose of guiding
the action or the government In the
conduct of the war.
For instance, when we get informa

we pass that information on to the
