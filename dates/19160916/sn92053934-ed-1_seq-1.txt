THE WAR TODAY
On a front of six mile north of
the Somme In t rance, the British
forces by smashing the German
line, have made probably the most
notable advance since the Anglo
French offensive began on Jnly 1.
Three towns, two woods and the
possession of nearly all the hhrh
ground between (ombles and the
Pozieres-Bapaume road fell to the
British, whose drives Imperil the
('ombles and Thlepval position.
The advance on the northern end
of the front was for a distance of
two miles. The Germans under
Crown Prince ISupprecht of Bava
ria fought stubbornly, London
says, and the lighting was severe
all along the line. .More than 2,300
prisoners were taken by the
British.
In northern Macedonia the Brit
ish, French and Serbian armies
have gained additional successes.
French troops took Bulgarian posi
tions a half mile deep on a front of
one mile. The Serbians captured
MaJkanidze. The British gained
ground wot of the Vardar. I'nof
liciallj, it is reported that the Bul
garians retreated 12 miles in front
of the entente rush, and Athens re
ports the abandonment of Kastorla
by the Bulgarians.
WILSON CAN
WIELD CLUB
IN BLOCKADE
Great Britain's Order About
Holland Shipments Sub
ject of Probe.
EMBASSY IN DENIAL
Consul General Skinner Says
List Was Modified for
Insurance Interests.
Washing-ton, Sept. 16 The
state department today sought to
learn through diplomatic channels
what commodities are Included in
Great Britain's last blockade
order restricting' shipments from
the United States to Holland and
the Scandinavian countries. If
the action is fonnd to shut out any
great quantity of American trade
with these neutral countries, it
doubtless will be regarded serious
ly by this government.
Interest in the effect of the order
was enhanced at the time by the fact
that President Wilson was granted au
thority by recent legislation to retali
ate against interference unduly with
American commerce.
The state department is interested
in ascertaining whether the reported
arrangements between . Great Britain
and France for exchange of commodi
ties whose importation from other
countries is forbidden does not violate
the British-American commercial
treaty of 1915.
The American embassy at London
was requested to confirm published
Trrpmts of the new order and explain
Its scope and effect upon American
I commerce.
j American Consul General Skinner
'cabled today that the "black list."
j order had been modified to permit
J British marine insurance companies
; to underwrite insurance of property
i instead of blacklisted United States
j concerns.
Officials here believe the real mo
tive of the modification is to enable
American underwriters to hold
American insurance business and not
lose it through operation of the
"blacklist."
, Britain Denies Effect.
While the state department is in
vestigating the latest British order
restraining commerce to Norway,
Sweden, Denmark and Holland, offi
cials are in some doubt as to wheth
er it affects American goods already
covered by letters of assurance
through the operation of the Nether-j
tanas overseas 1 run.
British embassy officials say it docs
not. They say that no change so
fundamental as that reported in Lon
don dispatches could possibly have
been made without notification to
made here.
The only official information before
the state departmcnt--a cablegram
from Consul General Skinner dated I
Sept. It seems to be supporting the
view that the new order actually
works no change, for it says "it is
presumed that American goods al
ready covered by letters of assurance
will not be stopped."
Absolutely no change of policy has
been made by England in months, ac
cording to British embassy officials.
The plan to allow only enough im
ports into neutral states contiguous
to Germany to provide them with such
a stock of goods as they consumed be
fore the war, British official say, has
been in operation many months.
They point out that when the maxi
mum stock in any country is reached
no more "letters ot assurance are
given to Americans and no more
licenses are given to British export
ers. ONE MAN KILLED,

New York, Sept. 16. Several trade
unions voted today for the purpose of
determining their response to the call
for a sympathetic strike to back up the
striking car employes.
By Monday labor leaders expect to
learn the sentiment of the longshore
men, teamsters, tidewater boatmen,
coal bargemen and stationary engi
neers and firemen to whom the car
men have particularly addressed their
appeal. By Monday, they assert, 70,000
men will be called out "to protect the
very life of union labor in New York."
Union leaders announce that the
majority of the members of machin
ists' unions having a membership of
25,000 have voted to strike.
One man was killed and 34 persons
were Injured In accidents on the ele
vated and surface car lines within the

MEX, 4TH O'JULY
IS BIG GALA DAY
Flairs Flutter at Capitol in Honor of
116 Years of National
Independence.
Mexico City, Sept. 16. Militarism
was opposed and universal military
training advocated in a Mexican inde
pendence day celebration speech here
today by Felix Palavicini, minister of
public instruction. Palavicini spoke as
the unofficial representative of Gen
eral Carranza.
Taespeaker declared that while It
was the Intention to establish a strong
government in Mexico, it was not in
tended that such a government should
be controlled by military power alone.
Universal military training, the pfin
ister said, would fulfill the plans' of
the de facto government, because
when each citizen had been made a
trained soldier, there would be no
chance for the army to control and
"run over those engaged in civil pur
suits." The one hundredth and sixth anni
versary of Mexican independence was
being generally celebrated today
throughout the republic.
In the capital, where nearly every
building is aflutter with flags and dec
orated with the national colors, mil
itary and civil organizations paraded
through flower-strewn streets. Bands
played in every park and a chorus of
a thousand voices, trained for weeks,
Bang patriotic songs.
In addition to the formal speeches
and meetings, a program of sports
modeled closely after the program of
the Olympic games drew athletes from
all over the country, although the
larger part of the tremendous list of
entries came from the schools and
colleges in or near the capital. A field
was laid out for track and field events,
baseball games, basketball and asso
ciation football matches. General
Carranza donated 80,000 pesos to pro
vide the equipment.
Baseball has secured a wide bold
throughout Mexico and an excellent
game was played here. A gala per
formance at the opera and a special
bull fight also drew large crowds.

HUNGARIAN DIET
OPPOSING TISZA
Parliamentary Foes Charge Anstria
With .Neglect of Political Duty
in Mar Time.
Vienna, Sept. 14 (via Berlin and Lon
don, Sept. 16, 9:48 a. m.) The opposi
tion still is waging an active parlia
mentary war against Count Tisza in
the Hungarian diet.
For the last 10 days the criticism
of Tisza has hinged on a matter which
only indirectly affects the Hungarian
diet the moving of Austrian and Hun
garian delegations in bodies which at
tend the state affairs that Austria and
Hungary have in common.
Tisza's opponents demand that the
delegations be convened for the pur
pose of attending certain military
and political affairs which, it is charg
ed, are being neglected by the Aus
trian government. They consist of
alleged incompetency in the adminis
tration of foreign affairs and efficicn- !
cy in the Austro-Hungarian army ad
ministration, both of these charges
being connected directly with Ruma-
'nia's entry into the war.
The opposition to Tisza continues to
assert that the department of Baron
von Burian, the foreign minister, and
the Tisza government have failed to 1
take the necessary military precau
tions in Transylvania and that they
are guilty of most flagrant failure in
not warning the population in Tran
sylvania to leave their homes before
the Rumanian advance took place,
with the result that the year's crops
and many cattle were lost.
Premier Tisza has pointed out that
the opposition was mistaken, the op
portunity therefor being given by an
Interview with Baron Burian which
was seized upon by the opposition to
Interpellate Tisza, who, in a masterly
1 1 ,.. 4 . . . . T T . . .'

government was runy acquainted with
the situation in Bucharest and expect
ed the declaration of war by Rumania,
but that the Rumanian government
was obliged by the entente to act pre
cipitately, Rumania being not quite
ready, as developments In Dobrudja
had shown.
Meanwhile the demands of the op
position are dwindling in number and
vehemence. At first the opportion
demanded the retirement from power;
of Tisza and his party. The next de
mand was for a coalition ministry, in
cluding Tlsa; and finally for such a
ministry to exclude him. Today the
hopes of the premier's opponents are
limited to adding from their own
ranks several ministers without port
folios. JOHN D. SHOOP IN
