CORN YIELD WILL BE SMALL
Estimates Place This Year's Average
at About 17 Bushels to the
Acre in f.isourl.
The following report, showing Mis
souri crop conditions on September 1,
has been issued by W. L. Nelson, as
sistant secretary of tho rtato board
of agriculture:
The long hot, dry spell which pro
vailed throughout most of Missouri
has been broken, except in a few
counties. However, where rains havo
fallen they havo generally been too
late to benefit, to any appreciablo ex
tent, growing crops. In a few coun
ties, whero no rain of consequence
has fallen in eight or ten weeks, con
ditions aro serious, according to tho
reports of correspondents.
Hoped-for August rains with raoro
favorable conditions for Missouri corn
wero realized in but n few favored
counties. Taking the stato as a
wholo, tho loss over tho possible yield
as indicated on August 1 has been
heavy. Conditions of corn Is now 53.4
as compared with G7.2 ono month ago,
73.1 ono year ago and 72.3 as tho
ten-year September 1 average. Pres
ent condition, however, is not as low
as for 1913, when corn lost 29 points
during August and stood at 41.8 on
'September 1. It might also be re
called that on September 1, 1901, tho
condition of Missouri corn was but
27. Based on tho estimated planting
of 7,218,500 acres, n total yield Is In
dicated of slightly more than 135,000,
000 bUBhels, or about seventeen bush
els perncre. With n seasonable Sep
tember and with u very lute frost tho
yield of lato-planted corn may result
In raising tho present forecast.

In an order recently Issued, E. D.

1
fiave You al!
Here's a fellow who has tasted at least
once every sort of outlandish, grub
he's heard of including snake and
butcherbird V V V V
V GRANDFATHER was n
devoted stamp collcotoi. I
had nn aunt who spent her
entire life and 1111 unuulty
acquiring china plates
which nobody was ever al
lowed to use. My father
had so much pewter In his home mat
the pluco almost tinkled as jou
cro-sod the threshold. My only sister
has n unique assortment of samplers
to show for it life of industry nnd
vigilance. Is It any wonder that I In
herited the collecting habit? nsks Percy
Waxninn In the New York Trib
une. Then ho goes on to tell his
story :
My acquisitive instinct, however,
has taken an entirely different I urn.
I am a collector of tastes. From
early childhood the gustatory novelty
bus possessed an Inordinate. charm for
me. I have n seemingly Inexhaustible
curiosity where unheard-of edibles
are concerned.
Needless to say, this rather unusual
form of tho collecting mania from
which I suiter has led me Into many
queer outing adventures, some of
which have proved most amusing us
well us highly Instructive.
As a boy I lived In Australia, nnd It
was there that I handled my ilrst gun.
It was presented to mo on my twelfth
birthday. I had to promise to shoot
only for oducntlouul purposes or to
obtain food.
Fifteen miles away from the city of
Melbourne Is a delightfully hilly dis
trict known ns Diamond creek. I de
cided that Diamond creek should be
the scene of my first attack on the
brute creation.
In and out of the gum tree cloisters
I scraped and snooped nnd dodged,
aping tho heroes of nil tho hunting
stories I had ever read. On and on I
punted till nt last I saw n strange
looking bird alight on top of a blue
gum. A joyful tremor went through
me.
I poised my gun. I took aim. I
pulled tho trigger. Bangl nnd oh,
Joy of joys I down fell my Ilrst "game."
To my hoy's eyes my bird seemed
the largest, wildest and most ferocious
thing in the- world. In reality It was
u little larger than n robin. I looked
it the bird. It wus quite strange to
1110. I had never seen Its like before.
Tho sun was straight overhead.
That meant lunch. The brilliant In
spiration came to me that In obedience
to my promise I ought to out my
prey. I cleaned him In the creek as a
hoy cleans things and patiently roasted
my quarry. And then I ute him. Tho
flavor seemed a little disappointing. It
did not taste anything like tho kind
of game I got ut home. It tasted al
most "queer."
Several days later I again went
"hooting, this time accompanied by a
much older boy, who knew lots and
lots about game and bush lore and
things. To my delight, shortly after
wo hud plunged Into tho bush I
brought down another of these gray
birds nnd proudly pume running to
whero my companion was, to show him
my prize. To my amazed horror he
burst out laughing.
"And Is that the kind of bird you
ato?" he roared. "Do you know what
that Is?"
"No."
"That is a butctor bird! It's ono
of tho buzzard family."
I don't suppose many of my renders
havo ever sipped the delectable thirst
destroyer known ns kava. I sincerely
hope not. Its native heath Is Samoa.
I had often read of the celestial In
spiration to be derived from hashish,
sake and other exotic liquids, nnd be
fore landing In Apia I used to wonder
If Robert Louis Stevenson's nfilutua
had over received any assistance from
kuvu.
It was almost under the shadow of
Stevenson's own Vallma that my own
brief, never-to-be-forgotten plunge In
to u bowl of kava splashed Its way
Indelibly Into my personal history.
I hud suenked off by myself to pay
a visit to a native hut. There In a
cone-shaped, thatched, beehlve-IIko
abode of smell I was invited to trv
tho famous Samoan drink, a whltey-
gruy liquid much betrothed, resem
bllng for all the world that which Is
found In the humble boiler on Mon
days after the linen has Just been
hung out to dry.
My ilrst sip tasted all right, and I
think 1 became perhaps n llttlo over
confident and Increased tho pressure
of my Intake too speedily. FIvo min
utes after my Ilrst sip I was whirling
HURT HIM TO "LOOSEN W"
College Tightwad In Dlstrr4 at Hav
ing to Pay, as He Put yp, "Two
Bits a Tv.tA."
Occasionally tho f.tovcrblal collego
spender finds his cmvv'.b In 'tho pud-
locked pockotbook variety. Ono of
1 those rnro examples wns thrown among
J ti group of "nlways broko" individuals
In tho close bonds of fraternal brother
hood nt Del'auw.
It wa? wU known that Irish hud
through Elyslan fields at ono thou
sand miles no hour.
When I came to I was lying In what
would hnvo been a corner of the hut
If It lind not been built quite round,
and a rather copiously built Samoan
lady was smiling tolerantly ut me
while she fanned me with u Tnpn
cloth.
I was presented with an Inventory
tabulating various articles of furniture
nnd expensive heirlooms which hnd
somehow or other been utterly de
stroyed during my kavngnrlcs.
And now a word or two about the
manner of making this Sntnonn nut
sundae. Large, copper-colored Indies,
whoso facilities for mastication are
considered perfect, chew the root of
tho kava plant until It Is time to er
cr er you know. Into the kava bowl.
Then water and coeounut milk aro
added. Tho concoction Is allowed to
ferment. Then It Is ready to shoot.
On a fishing and shooting expedition
In a remote corner of New South
Wales, meat became rather scarce. 1
Ono day we found ourselves almost
entirely out of supplies. With no Im
mediate opportunity of receiving any,
I made up my mind te try an experi
ment and add roast kangaroo to the
bill of faro for supper.
I make no pretense nt flattery when
I pay my honest tribute to the magnifi
cent upholstery possessed by the hind
quarters of a kangaroo, nllve or roast
ed. When I attempted to dlsposo of
my portion of the succulent dish It
seemed ns If an automobile lire
stricken with wanderlust had strayed
Into my dish. It possessed a Krupp
llke recoil that acted rellexly. And
the flavor! Well, the flavor of roast
kangaroo Is supplied entirely by the
Imagination.
Experienced bushwhackers had oft
en told 1110 that the Australian abo
riginals looked upon snakes ns more
or less of n table delicacy.
So ono dny In the bush, on n kan
garoo hunt, fute led mo to cross the
path of u huge diamond snake.
I Interrupted his slumbers rather
rudely by blowing his head off. When
tho tlmo arrived to prepare him Tor
dinner I had him colled up in a ball
of clay according to tho nutlve method
nnd baked.
In the search for knowledge there
must be martyrs, of course, but I will
gracefully step aside In future and
let who will wrest from me without a
struggle the right to Inform n waiting
world what It feels llko to Indulge In
diamond sunko baked.
Can you Imagine having a quart of
chewing gum suddenly thrust Into
your unwilling mouth In such a way
that you cannot get it out? Well,
that's how u mouthful of snako be
haves. Seated on tho bank of n creek one
day in New South Wales, I was busily
removing leeches from tho Insldn of
my loggings, when a flash of brown
fur whipped ncross my path. I
grabbed my gun and let drlvo at the
curlou creature, and when 1 hopped
on ov. leg to tho scene of its demlso I
pl'i'.ed up what looked llko n colossal
fiiinea pig masquerading us 11 rat. It
was n bandicoot.
11 plentiful supply of hard coin, but
with It nn ability to hold on to it
through thick nnd thin. This tenacity
wits carried to nn extreme that wor
ried tho empty-pocketed brothers and
any' shock that cost Irish a "bone"
was n source of amusement.
Unfortunately, tho Irlbhmiin played
class football nnd In tho melee
sprained n toe. With n long faco ho
wont t,o n prominent physician nnd had
tho Injured member bandaged. When
he como homo it was with u downcast
front to announce "Lost four bits,"
e foods JjjU
My native boy told me excitedly
that bandicoot was grand to cat "all
the same them plurry pfeller pig"
and so I had the ono I shot taken
home nnd roasted.
I have never seen anything on a dish
that hud such-a far-off, hopeless look
as that particular specimen when It1
appeared on tho tabic. Threo bites was
enough.
Although I havo never knowingly
tasted roasted house rat, I have a
well defined belief that is what tho
flavor of bandicoot really resembles.
Hero is n llttlo lnsde war news.
Now thnt Italy has taken a hand In
the struggle, let mo prophesy that
even If her entire navy be sunk all tho
blockades in the world will not sturve
her Into submission.
On a cruise in tho Mediterranean
somo years ago I put In nt the delight
ful island of lschla, In the Gulf of Nn
pies. In the chief hotel there I had
ono of my choicest gustatory adven
tures. I saw n nnmo on tho menu thnt
sounded musical to me, so I pointed at
It. An obliging waiter brought It.
It was Indeed n most curious look
ing dish. It appeared to bo n large,
horny tarantuln Unit had committed
sulcldo In a bowl of oil. At first I
thought it must bo a table 'decoration
or a souvenir of my visit. Uut, no; I
saw tho same dish handed to other
