GRAND OPENING OF MOUNT'
CARMEL CONVENT.
'—' I
The Boarding and Day Schools, J
conducted b v the Sisters, opened
with a Banner enrollment, a* it
leads in its number of boarders,
all other siieh institutions, that is. ;
"girls academies."
New Iberia is proud of this, the
Sisters more so, as it testifies to
the satisfaction of parents in re
gard to the Boarding Sehool and
the manner in which it is con
ducted. Nine Sisters are em
I
ployed as teachers. Two music,
teachers have lessons on the dif -j
ferent instruments, for all hours
of the day ; so many pupils for 1
music that outsiders, that is,
pupils of other schools must be re
jected. A Sewing Class has lieen
organized. The pupils are taught
organized. The pupils are taught
to make their own clothes—also
fancy work and needle work of,
all sorts. A Commercial Course;
of two vears' standard has its (
pupils graduates, working in dif-j
ferent firms, all giving satisfac-|
tion not only by their efficient,
work, but, by their becoming
manners as "ladies;" the lack of i
which is deplorable in this our;
enlurhtened, but, "Forgetful;
Age. All these advantages are i
ffiven to pupils boarders and dav|
pupils alike. A magnificent build
ing shelters them all ; yet to sa y,
were the New Iberia Convent, less
popular abroad, were the boarding
school children, of other states and
towns to be eliminated, we would
stand "a vprv poor, dilapidated
■how." Hence the building isbeing_

paid for, by the 'boarding sehool.
|The Convent is a resource to the
I city as the Sisters purchase every -
J thin«, from the kitchen nto the
wardrobe in New Iberia. With
out these boarders, but five Sisters
would be needed. In this case it
; is God's help. The Catholics of
New Iberia are very backwards
when it comes to the proper edu
cation lor their children and tha'
we love "New fberia" our
adopted home, and hear it praised.
I our hearts are downcast, yet nev
er a complaint, but "right here,"
home, to all we say. We are
growing, the Convent is patro
nized, we have friends from out
side and. "God helps them that
help themselves." The boarders
will pass the hnlf-hundred mark.

THE THIRD DISTRICT.
The result.of the primary Tues
day determines the personnel of
the Louisiana delegation in the
House, the Third district excepted.
Seven Democratic nominees have
been named and their selection as
; Democratic standard-bearers is
tantamount to election.
There is left, however, one fight
to be made ; and it will interest
the State from now until next
November. We hope it is not
too much to expect of the Third
district that its vote will show
decisively its appreciation of thc
anomalous situation which would
be presented if it sent Mr. Whit
Martin back to Washington as
the bearer of a Progressive com
com
mission.
The Progressive party is no
longer a national nartv. Tt has
no candidate for President ; un
less Mr. Whit Martin is elected
it will have no member in the
next Congress, and. whatever the
result in November, it will be in
capable of rendering anv service
to the sugar interests of Louisi
■Mr. Martin wag elected two
TOarg ago as a protest against
Mr. Wilson's decision to pnt su
iter on the free list, a decision
»at was inspired by no hostility
to Louiaiana or engar bot which

grew solely out of the J're.si

free sugar would tend to eheapen
the cost ot living to one liundreil
million American people.
We thought Mr. Wilson, in er
ror, both in departing from the
time-honored Democratic princ
iple 1 of making sugar the basic
stone of a revenue tîiritï and in
giving those interested iu the in
dustry and those dependent on
the industry—insufficient time to
which to -idjust themselves to new
industrial conditions.
But sugar is not on the free
list: there is no probability that
II ever go on the free list,
and the President and the Demo
cratic party have entirely re
paired what the sugar interests
delmed a wrong and which was a
ground for the protest embodied
in Mr. Martin's election two
years ago. j
