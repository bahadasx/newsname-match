PITTSBURG. Sept. 16.?Bits of bod

of flesh scattered through the ruins of
the wrecked building and the fact that
six men have been missing since an
explosion Friday night at the plant
of the Aetna Chemical Company in

a hurried investigation by the cor-i

not know the number of casualties but
expressed the belief that all working
in the building had been killed.

is given that suitable rooms have
been procured for the opening of the
school. These rooms will bp used un

REPUBLICANS AT
BIG LOVE FEAST
Perfect Harmony and Rampantj
Enthusiasm Mark a Fine
Meeting of Voters.
ATKINSON ENTHUSES
Officers Are Elected and Club is
Ready to Do Effective Work
in the Campaign.
With Harrison county Republicans.
! Progressives and independent voters
assembled in large numbers and a
rattling fine political talk which as
sumed the proportions of a regular
1 campaign speech by Judge George
? Wesley Atkinson, former governor of
j the state and recently retired from!
the United States court of claims at |
Washington, 1). C., the Harrison Coun
ty Hughes Club with a large charter
j membership was formed at a meeting
in the court house Friday night with
an enthusiasm that had Republican]
triumph in November unmistakably'
shining forth like the rays of the noon
day sun. There was manifest a get
together spirit such as none could mis
take and it showed a reunited party in
the county so complete that Democrats
need no longer try to tear it assunder.
Roy E? Parrish, county chairman,
called the big crowd to order and ex
plained the object of the meeting.
I. Wade Coffman made a motion that
Mr. Parrish act as chairman of the
meeting and that John C. Southern act
as secretary. The motion carried.
Charles C. Scott moved that a com
mittee of seven be appointed to recom
mend oiflcers for the club and the fol
lowing committee was named:
C. C. Scott. I. Wade Coffman. Dr. W.
; B. Conaway, Virgil L. Highland. C. H.
! Harding. Charles E. Lamberd and Guy -
II. Burnside.
Charles W. Moore moved that a com
> mittee of five be named to recommend
precinct vice presidents and the fol
lowing were appointed as such com
mittee:
Charles W. Moore. Ernest A. Rider.
W. G. Osborn, Dr. .1. J. Cranwcll and
A. I). Fitzhugh.
Virgil \*. Highland moved that a
committee of five be appointed to draft
a constitution and by-laws, and the
following were named on '.hat com
j mittee:
W. S. Stathers. L. C. Crile. C. D.
Floyd. Char|es G. Coffman and B.
Merendino.
S. C. Denham moved that a finac
committee of five be named and the
following were appointed as that
, committee:
S. C. Denham, G. H. Gordon. Harry
B. Curtin,, M. M. Pearlman and S. W. j
Bowman.
Judge Atkinson was then intro
duced by Chairman Parrish.
The committee on officers made its
report and as a result club oiflcers
: were elected as follows:
President?Harry C. Hoffman.
Secretary?W. S. Slathers.
Treasurer?W. G. Osborn.
Executive committee?Hoy E. Par
rish. Ernest A. Rider, R. B. Willison.
Howard M. Gore and Charles H.
Harding.
S. C. Denhani, Roy E. Parrish, L. j
C. Crile and V. L. Highland were ap-l
j pointed to secure headquarters for
the club.
: After reviewing the results of Dem
j ocratic tariff tinkering. Judge Atkin
I son declared that the paramount is
sue in this campaign is that of a
protectlce tariff and clearly explained
the Republican method of protecting
products that can be made in this
country and of importing free of
duty those articles which cannot be
produced in this country. As he
warmed up to his subject, the judge
hurled many a hot shot into the Dem
ocratic camp respecting that party's
stand op the tariff question and the
ludicrous manner in which it has had
to abandon Its free trade principles
In order to keep out of hot water.
If any Democrat were present he
would have had to blush with shame
over the miserable record of his par
ty on the tariff.
The position of disrespect Into
which the Wilson administration has*
placed the United States respecting;
the Mexican muddle and the relations
with European countries, resulting
in an orgy of diplomatic notes which
have virtually bartered away the self
respect of this country, were also dis
cussed by the speaker. He drove
home his points by showing that it
is not so much what Wilson has kept
us out of that counts as it is what
he has got us into, this being in reply
to the Democratic cty that the pres
ident has "kept us out of war." Judge
Atkinson said the reason Wilson has
| kept us out of war is because no na
tion has been able to go to war with
us.
Jndge Atkinson also pointed out
that the Democratic party could not
be trusted with Its promises, nearly
all of which havebeen broken. A
perusal of the Baltimore national
platform, he said, would show any In
telligent person whether the Demo
cratic party can keep its pledges. One
of its big promises, the one, perhaps,
on which they harped the most in the
last campaign, was to reduce the high
cost of living. Everybody knows that
the cost of living has not been re.
duced after four years of Democratic
guidance, hut that, on the contrary,
It has been raised.
Since the Democrat* have been In
power, they have placed political ex
pediency above party principles and
have prostituted the public service for
j the benefit of their own followers.
The Sixty-fourth Congress, the speak
er pointed out. created some 311.11111*
I odd Jobs for Democrats. Besides thls
Ihe Democrats have exceeded all
i bounds with a record of extravagance)
ut Washington that has startled tbe|
civilized world. A single Congress
has spent over two billions of dol-1
lars In the face of llie Democratic!
party's promise to be economical and
1 wipe out alleged Republican extrava
gance.
There Ifi one plank of the Demo
cratic platform of l'J12 which the
| people will force Mr. Wilson to keep
I this year, Judge Atkinson declared
with a twinkle. That Is the plank
binding the nominee of the Baltimore
convention to the principal of a single
presidential term. ,
Upon recommendation of the commit
tee on precinct vice presidents the
following such vice presidents were
chosen:
