There are cltliena who believe that
It la contrary to good public policy in
a free country to put too many of the
public offlcei In one community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by members of
the Corinery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
the Connerys have on public affairs.
The result is startling and of in
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some of this 'gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can use the United States Gov
ernment in their business.
They evidently have found the
State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to the family possessions.
Democrats in Chicago are wonder
' lng why all of the public Jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be due to the fact that thore
are not enough Connerys to go around.
Connerys First! '
What a noble family motto that Is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connerys and their well
known hankering for good things.

may have heard him referred to, a

Partner Blockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts In which the Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the public Interest In them
ever wholly died out
' There was a number of talented
'Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of these
worthies before as our flies will at
test.
But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
it about.
Democrats do, not forgot the dose
that some mombors of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunno In 1007 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many In
the light of the Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
it not to all, of the Jobs in Us gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great.

Is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
one of the princes ot the blood and
wore not over-enthusiastic for Swelt

This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph E. Bid

Sanitary District of Chicago.
State Street Blockl, the business
partner of John T. Connery, will not
have a chance to run again for his
present Job on the Board of Review,
until next year.
So William J. Connery, nephew of
John T., Joseph F., Francis D., and
Michael M. Connery will retain bis
nlce-salared Job as Blockl's Secretary.
But by next year a few, more of
flees may be created for a few more
Connerys as It would be too bad to
have Blockl, John T. Connery's part
nor in the coal business running on
a ticket where there was not another
member of the Connery family to keep
him from getting lonesome.
Connery first the rest nowhere.

Gang Attempt to Defeat Nomination
of Honest Governor Rebuked by
Democrats by a Great Tote.
Governor Edward F. Dunne was re
nominated at the Democratic primary
on Wednesday by a record breaking
voto.
Tho gang was defeated all along
the line In Its eleventh hour attempt
to defeat an honest official whom It
could not use.
In his address to tho people seeking
re-election Governor Dunne says:
"During the Forty-eighth general as
sembly, notwithstanding tho fact that
the Democratic members of both
houses were In a minority, I had tho
satisfaction of seeing twelve of the
eighteen measures recommended by
the Polls.
mo placed upon the statuto books,"
tho Govornor declared.
Following Is the list of twelve meas
ures which the Governor says were
placed on the statute books during his
administration:
Ratification of amendment to Fed
oral constitution providing for election
ot United . States Senators by direct
voto of the people.
The Public- Utilities Commission
law.
Tho law empowering all cities In the
State to own and operate public utili
ties. Tho law authorizing employment of
convicts on roads.
Tho law establishing an epileptic
colony.
The law providing for rotation ot
names of candidates for state offices
on ballots.

The law creating the legislative ref
erence bureau.
Tho law creating efficiency and econ

The law amending the 2-cent rail
way fare act so as to mako It apply to

The law creating a state highway
commission and providing for the
building of good roads.
The law compelling corporations to
pay wages semi-monthly.
The law consolidating the fish and
game commissions and reforming tho
abuses ot tho old separate commis
sions. "In addition to tho above," the state
ment adds, "I took plcasuro in further
ing tho passage of and signing tho bill
known as tho workmen's compensa
tion act, which revised the law of 1911,
and which provides, without litigation,
compensation to Injured employes for
Injuries sustained In tho course of
their employment.
"Llkewlso during my administration
tho Forty-eighth general assembly

greater safety In mining operations
and tho establishment of rescue sta
tions. It also passed tho electric head

Popular State's Attorney Wins
by a Practically Unanimous
Vote.
Stato'a Attornoy Hoyno, who was
renominated by a practically unan
imous vote, gave tho main points In
his platform to tho people before tho
primary when he decided to be a
candidate for re-election. He said:
"I regret that the existing' election

for State's Attoruoy and other muni
cipal offices to scok a partisan nomin
ation. National politics and policies,
and politics generally, should havo not
the slightest connection with tho of

havo conducted tho Stato's Attorney's

"My determination to bo a candidate-
Is and will remain,, unaffected by
tho action, desires or wishes of any in
dividual, or group of individuals, as
suming to glvo orders to tho mass of
tho party voters ot this county or to
myself.
"I feol'lt necessary to say this bo
cause ot silly newspaper artlcloa to
tho effect that certain Democratic
leaders wore organizing a local 'Tam
many,' and that candidates for party
nominations in this county would bo
compolled by a pledge to turn over tho
power of appointment and othor
patronage of tho offices they sought to

"I nover havo nor will I over sign,
give or mako such a pledge, or any
pledge whatever othor than that I

County. I disclaim any intention or
doslre, singly or Jointly, to Tammany

I know that I will permit no one to

hold or hope to hold."
"I recognize," ho said, "under the
existing election laws, tho legality and
propriety ot each political party choos
ing a county central committee, and
that committees havo certain powers
and duties to porform.
"Although tho nomination ot candi
dates for Stato's Attornoy and county
officers genorally Is not one ot tho
functions ot tho county central com
mittee, and although its indorsomont
or failure to Indorse binds neither tho

what has been said above, I shall seek
tho aid and Indorsement of my candi
dacy for nomination from the present
duly elected county central committee
of tho Democratic party, and hope,
upon my record In office, I may receive
it.
"I have referred to my record in of

this record Is not ono of drastic, harsh
and relentless prosecutions. No pub
Ho official or prlvato cttlzen, minister,
