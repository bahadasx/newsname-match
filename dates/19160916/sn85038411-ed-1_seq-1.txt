sen Reports Gains
The heavy offensive launched yes
terday by the British north of the
Somme, the most powerful In weeks,
was successful in gaining ground
along the entire line, except Imme
diately opposite Ginchy, where the
Germans clung on desperately, to
day's dispatches indicate.
The most important points gained
were the villages of Courcelette, east
of Thiepval; Martipuich, south of the
Pozieres-Bapaume road, and Flers,
two miles north of Ginchy. These
three villages are now completely in
possession of the British, London an

have begun counter attacking the
French at points where they recently
advanced, both north and south of the
Somme. Parris to-day reports the
repulse of German attacks east of
Clery, immediately north of the
stream, and near Berny, below the
river, southeast of Estrees.
Winning In Macedonia

the Bulgarians in'the center and on

renewed activity now is announced on
the right flank, where the British
have again thrown skirmishers across

won a decisive success against the
Rumanians and Russians, Field Mar

TO ASK CHARTER
AT ONCE FOR NEW
HOTEL COMPANY
Important Steps Preliminary to
Construction of Building
Taken
MANY NAMES SUGGESTED
Governor Commends Move;
Committee Invites Popular
Subscription
All Harrisburg is rejoicing in the
fact that the long-looked-for and
much-needed big hotel is no longer a
dream. Without a moment's loss of
time the active spirits of the hotel
company have undertaken the impor
tant steps preliminary to the construc
tion of the building. Application for a
charter will be made without delay
and meanwhile the organization of the
company will be completed and steps
taken to procure plans and develop the
other details connected with so impor
tant an enterprise.
Already in response to the Tele
graph's invitation many suggestions of
a name for the new hotel have been
received and it is hoped that many
others will be submitted. Governor
Brumbaugh was more than pleased
to hear that the new hotel had been
launched by Harrisburg citizens and in
an enthusiastic interview he adds his
commendation.
Tim Governor's Congratulations
Governor Brumbaugh, fresh from
the first of three tours of the agri
cultural districts of the State, said:
"The enterprising citizens of Harris
burg are to be congratulated and
thanked for their loyalty to the Capital
City in making possible a splendid
hotel for Harrisburg.
"I know of no city of equal promi
nence and size whose need is greater.
It will greatly add to the comfort of
those in official life, of the army of
professional and business men called
here, and of the social life of our city,
to have this magnificent institution
speedily in operation. I am particu
larly glad to note that, like many of
the best hotels in Atlantic City, it is to
be conducted without a bar. This will
give it added attraction as a home
hotel.
"It will in a special manner be of
great service as a headquarters hotel
for the thousands who in a few years
will be tcuring Pennsylvania over the
William Penn Highway and the radial
routes that will meet in this city.
"As an agency needed, as an added
attraction to the life of Harrisburg,
and, above all, as a practical demon
stration of the loyalty and enterprise
of the good people the city, it will
stand as a memorial of civic advance
and community co-operation."

the number of casualties, but ex
pressed the belief that all at work in
the building had been killed.
