bandits In their hill retreats Is based:
on this footlUK anil It is nencveu ine
riiKKCStioii that the Can inza govern
loenl undertake this task for Itself
as an International obligation came
from the Mexican commissioners.
The theory is that a force of care
folly selected mounted police could be
disposed In small posts In the hill
country. The chase would become an
Individual pursuit rather than a mili
tary movement which becomes Inef
fective If the bandits scatter and
inlimltt with peaceful residents. The
police would cheek up the comings and
Koitms of every man In a suspected
community. Moving swiftly and un

who form the eominijs.iry of a Mexi

believed, could do much toward init

of the conditions, with reference to
sanitation, in Chicago, Springfield
and other cities where this Important
matter was given Its duo considera
tion bv the city officials- As a re
sult of this tour they informed the
toinmlssloners yesterday morning
; they were of the opinion that one of
'the biggest problems now confronting
jthe executives of Tulsa was that of a
system of proper sanitary methods to
eliminate conditions wnn wnicn Doc

he assumed the duties of chief health
officer for Tulsa.

Aside from the report of their In

noted sanitary engineer, Frank Klarch.
and tho United Engineering company

To the Honorable Mayir ami ncara
of Commissioner's, ony ot io.a.
Gentlemen: We, as your committee,
desire to make report upon the In

matters, the handling and disposing-
of garbage, incineration ond reduction
plants etc. Our recommendations are
anivcd at from tho Information
leathered during our recent trip cast
to Chicago and other cities of the

Klist: Tho greatest menace to

toliots and wo suggest that every
bouse In the city where there arc
sewer and w.'or lines be compelled
to make con tion at once; thai the
sewer and wai.T lines b extended to

as fast a possible; thit ro building
permits be Issued In .llstrlrts where
sewers and water are In unless evi
dence Is furnished of sanitary con
nections when building a to bo com

sances not only that Ihe offensive

thev furnish breeding places for fdes

to the unacreenert food surplv. thus
causing disease. Nearly all our

While on tbls trip consultation was

who Is with the United States punllc
