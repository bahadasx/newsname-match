SIX MILE FRONT
Make Most Notable Gain Since
Anglo-French Offensive
Started July 1
COMBLES AND THIEPOAL
IN GREAT DANGER
Allies Have Kaiser's Forces Hem
med in, in Region of North
of Somme
London, Sept. 15.—Smashing the
German lines on a front of six miles
north of the Somme in France, the
British forces have made probably
the most notable advance since the
Anglo-French offensive began, July 1.
Three towns, two woods and the
possession of nearly all the high
ground between Combles and the Po
zieres-Bapaume road fell to the Brit­
ish. Not only did the Germans lose
these points, but the British drive
imperils the Combles and Thiepval
positions, at either end of the Brit­
ish front. The gaining of the high
ground north of Combles gives the
British command of the approaches
to Bapaume.
The advance on the northern end of
the front was for a distance of two
miles. Corcelette, east of Thiepval
and north of the Pozieres-Bapaume
road, and Martinpuich, south of the
road, fell into the hands of General
Haig's men. 'Further south of the
road they took Le Priez an dthe High
wood, making secure their possession
of Ginchy. Bouleaux wood, north of
Combles, also was lost to the Ger­
mans.
The Germans, under Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria, fought stub­
bornly to hold their ground, London
says, and the lighting was severe
along the lines. More than 2,300 pris­
oners were taken by the British.
Aiding the British in the encircle­
ment of Combles, the French have
taken additional trenches north of
Le Priez.
^...Sauthlof tire Fivctf ^three German
trenches near ftoiny-en-Santerre were
taken jy th French, who also captur­
ed 200. prisoners. Berlin claims the
repuls«jOf British attacks southeast
of Thiepval and of French efforts be­
tween Rancourt and the Somme. The
official stattement admits the loss of
Le Priez.
Break Bulgarian Defense.
In noi aern Macedonia the British,
French and Serbian armies have gain­
ed additional successes, breaking
down the Bulgarian defense in the
center and on the left wing.
Unofficially, it iy reported, the Bul­
garians retreated 12 miles in front of
the intense rush and Athens reports
the abandonment of Kastoria by the
/Bulgars. Berlin says Entente attacks
in the Moglenica sector and east of
the Varlar were repulsed.
The Italians have begun a new
drive toward Triest. Lines of Aus­
trian entrenchment east of the Val
lone have been taken, Rome reports,
together with more than 2,100 prison­
ers. Vienna, while admitting Italian
successes on the Jzonzo front, declares
the first assault is looked upon as a
failure.
In the Dobrudja region of Rouma
nia, Bucharest admits that the Rus­
sians and Roumanian troops are re­
tiring northward before the advance
of the forces of the Central Powers.
Violent lighting is in progress in
progress in this region. In Transyl­
vania, however, the Roumanian forces
are continuing their progress.

STILL DOUBTFUL
Pres. Wilson Will Not St ait Work
Until Sure of His Sister's
Condition
Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 15.—Pres­
ident Wilson's campaign plans were
further disturbed today by receipt of
word from New London, Conn., that
his sister, Mrs. Anna Howe, who is
critically ill, spent a restless night.
It appeared probable that Mr. Wilson
would cancel an engagement to go to
St. Louis September 20, to speak be­
fore an underwriters' convention.
Such disturbing news from Mrs.
Howe's bedside was received this
morning that the president planned
on going to New London immediately.
Later in the afternoon, however, word
was received that she was slightly
better and Mr. Wilson postponed the
trip.

Major General Bliss Appears Be

Gives His Views
TELLS DIFFICULTIES OF
THE PROPOSED PLAN
New London, Conn., Sept. 15.—A
suggestion that the Mexican govern­
ment create a constabulary for border
duty similar to that of the Diaz re­
gime was made today during a brief
session of the American-Mexican joint
commission, concluding the second
week of its deliberation. Apparently
the plan for a joint police force, pre­
viously discussed, was abandoned as
impractical, after the commission had
conferred with Major (!encritl Bliss,
assistant chief of staff of the United
States army.
General Bliss, it was learned, made
to the joint commission today, a dis­
passionate statement of the situation
he believed would follow General Per­
shing's withdrawal from Mexico be­
fore a properly constituted constabu­
lary is created to relieve his troops.
It is understood he pointed out
problems in the way of an effort to
create a border police under dual
authority.
There is reason to believe the Amer­
ican commisisoners have sought to
impress their Mexican conferees with
the view that Mexico must recognize
responsibility for the depredation on
the border if relations are to be un­
impaired.

FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND WOMEN'S CLUBS PETITION
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO HAVE WILLIE ZIMMER SENT
TO A REFORM SCHOOL INSTEAD OF DEATHv AND GIVEN
New Orleans, ka., Sept. 14.—Willie Zimmer, 12 years old, slayer of his
own mother, Mrs. Mary Zimmer, mother of three other children, will face,
within six weeks, the criminal district
court on trial for his life.

By FREDERICK E. HAMLIN.
The state of Louisiana will demand,
for the first time in its history ind
tUft fourth* timp, ill r.!^r .-f the
country, that a boy lie seni to the
gallows!
A boy in short, trousers—an urchin
of the streets, too young a'ld uned­
ucated to think for himself and de­
prived of proper parental training
from infancy—must pay for his crime
with his life on the gallows, unless—
the mothers and fathers of Louisiana
and every state in the country enter
a mighty protest or plea to Chandler
C. Luzenberg, district, attorney, to
drop the indictment charging murder
in the first degree, and allow Willie
Zimmer to be sent to a reform school,
preferably the national institution at
Washington, where he can get a
chance in life!
Women's clubs, school parents'
cluhs and individual mothers and
fathers of New Orleans already have
taken up the question of whether the
Zimmer child shall have a fresh start
in life and be .made into a man.
Three of the leading u'/j.-neys of
New Orleans have volunteered their
services to give him only a chance.
Convicted or acquitted, they want him
sent to a reform school. They be­
lieve lie is a victim of evil environ­
ment, citing the report of Coroner
.). A. O'Hara to the district attorney
that the boy is sane, a sliewd crimi­
nal, but that if properly trained he
can be made into a smart man.
A smart, man or a shrewd crook—
which?
The attorneys, B. 15. Howard, H. O.
Hollander and Ulic Burke, now are
preparing the legal defense. The boy
is held without bond.
Attorney Howard, who, by the way,
has no sons, but two grown daugh­
ters. says he does not believe any
court can And 12 men who will con­
vict the Zimmer boy.
Readers of the Tribune will recall
the story recently of the mental ex­
amination of Willie Zimmer, when it
was proposed that a surgical opera­
tion might reform the boy, who tried
to burn his baby sister and a cat
alive who spent half of his life, be­
ginning at 7 years of age, until the
present, in the juvenile court home of
New Orleans, and who climaxed his
career of crime by killing his moth-
Mrs. Zimmer and her husband had
separated, she taking their two daugh­

Thomas street, while Willie stayed
with his father. Court records show,
the father several times threatened to
kill Mrs. Zimmer that they quarrel­
ed nearly all the time because of his
drinking.

"grew up" in the streets, quarrels at
night their lullaby.

DETAILS OF BIC
SWIHDLIHC PLOT
Scheme To Get Large Amount
From 17 U. S. Banks Is Dis­
covered
TYPEWRITER LEADS TO
IDENTITY OF F0.4GER
German Known As Karl Von
Bardi Worked in Banks to
Get Official's Signatures
Chicago, Sept. 15.—Details of what
is said to have been an elaborate
plot to swindle 17 banks in the Unit­
ed States out of an ainount estimated
at between $300,000 ajid $500,000 were
made public here today. At the same
time it was announced that a detect­
ive would leave Chicago for Gothen­
burg, Sweden, armed with extradition
papers for Karl von Bardi, wanted in
connection with the alleged plot.
Von Bardi, according to the Swed­
ish consul here, has been languishing
in a Gothenburg jail since last May,
when he was captured through a wire­
less message on a charge of having
forged checks for $3,000 in the name
of a local varnish making company.
Although the Swedish authorities
have refused to. extradite him, they
have also refused to release im from
jail.
According to the police, von Bardi
assumed in Chicago the name of a
French count. Here and in other Am­
erican cities he worked for five years
in one bank after another, familiar­
izing himself, it is said, with the bank
officials' signatures and gathering a
supply of stationary and blank forms.
Soon after his arrival and arrest
in Sweden, banks in Chicago and oth­
er cities received inquiries from
Swedish banking institutions as to tue
whereabouts of one Knut 'Bagge. Let­
ters of credit in his favor, it was
said, had not been cashod.
American bankers found that no
letters of credit had been issued to
E'agge. It developed that 17 Swedish
banks were holding letters of credit
from as many American institutions,
dfjponvting to the account of Knut
Bagge, amounts varying from £6,500
to 150,000 kronen. The Swedish bank­
ers were ready to ash them, but Mr.
"Bagge" hadn't appeared.
One of the original letters sent
back to Chicago showed that certain
typewritten letters were badly worn.
Finally the typewriter upon which
the letter had (been written was lo­
cated in the possession of an employe
of a down town hotel. He had pur­
chased it, ho said, from Karl von Bar­
di.
The date of von Bardi's arrival in
Sweden, it was found, was virtually
the same as that of the arrival of
the fraudulent letters of credit.
BULLET CRASHES INTO HOME.
Moorhead, Minn., Sept. 15.—A bul­
let that crashed through a winoow in­
to the F. L. Getty home, this city,
narrowly missing a member of the
family and flattening out against a
wall, is believed to have been fired
by a property owner guarding his
apple orchard against a gang of
youths.
All towns or individuals who have
funds for the North Dakota ambu­
lance fund are requested to send
them at once to the Bismarck Daily
Tribune. With what is outstanding,
there is almost enough to purchase a
motor ambulance for the hospital
corps of the First North Dakota regi­
ment.
Napoleon increased the fund yester­
day by a donation of $61.00. F. Bry­

ALL GO TO JAIL
Scranton, Pa., Sept. 15.—Bail in the
aggregate sum of $935,000 was de­
manded of 187 Industrial Workers of
the World, who were given hearings
today for participation in the forbid­
den meeting raided in Old Forge, this
state, yesterday, and which resulted
in 267 arrests by Sheriff Phillis, a
dozen deputies and 20 state troopers.
Each defendant was also fined $10
for disorderly conduct. None gave
bail or paid the fine and all went back
to the county jail. The prisoners were
loaded into four trolley cars and taken
in batches of about fifty each to four
different ward magistrates.
Fourteen of the 50 defendants in
one magistrate's office raised their
hands when the attorney representing
the prosecution asked, "How many of
you are citizens."
Hundreds of friends of the prison­
ers, many of them women, canje from
Old Forge to this city today, many
bearing food andf clothing, which they
tried unavailingly to get into the jail.
Old Forge was quiet today and to­
night. The town of Jessup, 12 miles
to the north of Scranton, which is an­
other strong I. W. W. locality, was in
a state of excitement all day, but a
squad of state troopers prevented any
disturbance.

corps.
Ambulance Necessary.
Dr. T. H. MacLachlan, captain of
the hospital corps, who has returned
on a furlough, states that a motor am­
bulance would assist greately in car­
ing for the men.
Considerable interest has been
shown in the movement to purchase
an ambulance for the First regiment.
Outside of Bismarck, little money has
been subscribed by towns having a
company of the national guards, those
cities preferring to contribute to the
various company.mess funds.
It is hoped to close the fund within
the next week, so everyone who cares
to contribute is urged to do so within
the next week.

Issue and 70 Per Cent Favor
Carmen
New York, Sept. 15.—Eighty thous*
and workers in craft closely affiliat*
ed with the operation of New York
traction lines are expected to go on
strike Monday, it was announced at
the close of a meeting of the Central
Federated union here tonight. Rep*
resentatives of 400,000 unionized em*

and passed a resolution calling on
each trade to ascertain the sentiment
of members regarding a general
strike in sympathy with the carmen,
who quit their places September 6.
In a referendum of union machin*
ists, it was said, their vote showed
70 per cent favored a sympathetic
strike.
Leaders attached much Importance
to the action of the machinists, many
of whom are employed in plants man*
ufacturing munitions of war for the
Entente Allies. The effect of the
strike in that trade, they said, would
be a direct blow at the Morgan in*
terests, the largest holders of stoclc
in the Inter-borough company. J. P.
'Morgan & Co. are the official agents
of the British government in this
country.
Several Injured.
Several persons were injured, none
of them seriously, in two traction ao*
cidents tonight. The most serious
was a rear-end collision between two
cars on the elevated lines. Two trol­
ley cars were in collision in the
Bronx and four persons, one a pa­
trolman on strike duty, were injured.
It is said the cars were being oper­
ated by. strike -breakers.
The publi9 service cdriiintMlon
brought its inquiries intp the strike
to a close today. The commission de­
clared that "the strike should be call­
ed off at once and the agreement oC
August 1 should be lived up to in let*
ter and spirit," the statement con*
eluded.
