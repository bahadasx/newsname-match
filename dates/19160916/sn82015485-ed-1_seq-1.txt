THE BUDGET SYSTEM
Cappar Says It WiU Sound Death
Knell to Pork Barrel
Topeka, Kansas, September loth:
Among the forward looking-measures
which Governor .Capper will urge the
next legislature to consider will be
the budget system for handling state
appropriations.- President Wilson,
former President Taft and Governor
Hughes are staunch advocates of the
budget system.- In his recent speech
at Sparks, Kansas., the governor, laid
particular emphasis on this issue as a
means, of riding the' state and the
nation of pork barrel legislation.
"I fought against the log. rolling,
pork barrel politicians two years
ago,'- said Governor Capper. "If re
elected I sha.l be delighted to keep
up that fight with all the earnestness
I possess. The remedy is the budget
system. There is nothing .that will
deal the pork barrel a harder blow in
the slats. The budget is a complete
list of appropriations. The budget
system authorizes the governor to
present in advance to the legislature
a carefully itemized schedule of the
needs of the state, its departments,
its schools, its charitable institutions
and reformatories. The legislature
cannot add to' the budget, but may
reduce items. After the legislature
has adopted the budget, it may pass
other appropriations if i,t likes,
but these appropriations are subject
to two safeguards the "governor's
veto and trie adoption by the legisla
ture of a special tax levy to pay for
these additional appropriations.
And the legislature that does
Khat unjustifiably will most certain
ly and unmistakably hear from the
people. Its fate will be a warning, if
any warning is needed, to all other
legislature that come after.
"With a budget system for a guid
ance of the legislature, running ex
penses, maintainence charges" and
estimates of needed improvements
will vary no more than they do in
any well Conducted business, if the
same authority is given the governor
to disallow or approve them as is
given to the manager of every big
business. This kind of a system will
come just as soon as the people de
mand it, but it will never come until
they do demand it.
' So long as I am governor I shall
continually do all I can to make it
Impossible to spend a dollar of public
money other than honest and profit
ably. But a " governor should have
the power to compel this In the people's-interest."

Kansas country -towns are to hold

what they will have to face in the
years to come. If Kansas people are
to nave good communities, good stores,
good markets, good churches, pood
schools good roads, they must make
tnese nmgs themselves. The big
cities want all the men and monev
they can get from Kansas, but' they
win never send to Kansas the men

Mr. Marts while here arranged for
publication in this paper a seties of

widely read, and he is in great de
mand as a speaker before commercial
organisations. Mr. Goodwin bellevs
tnat ir the country town u to -hold
Its own, It will do so only through
tiie co-operation or the farmer and
the merchant, as the prosperity of
each depends on" the ' general" pros
perity or the community. "
Before taking the train. Mr. Marts
handed the editor a list of local men
ana arms who .. had promised him
their warmest support and co-odb ra
tion along -lines of community better
ment for this locality.
"You have a number of real live-
wire business and professional men

your people will just take as much
interest in your town as these men
are tafctng-ar they will co-operate
with these- men and -eJve- t,hm t.hn
support they should have the future
ot your; town is assured. But a few

You have here men who -are willing
and glad to give time and energy and
money to make your town 'a better
town, and a little encouragement and
help from other citizens will result'
in a great good to all."

JOHNSON WALZ
Supu Warner Johnson " and Miss
Kathryn Walz suprised their many
friends by being quietly, married at
Denver, Colo., August 22nd. While
it was quite generally understood
among their close friends that the
happy couple sometime contemplated
connubial bliss, yet it came as a com
plete surprise when they learned Sat
urday that the nuptial knot had al
ready been tied.
The bride is a teacher and an ac
complished young lady, possessing
many admirable qualities; she comes
of a highly respected and well-to-do
family and is especially fitted by re
finement and culture-to reign-at
queen of ' home.
The groom is a son of Mr. and Mrs.
E. Johnson, of the North Fork, and
is a fine young man. At present he
is serving as county superintendent
of schools and is a -candidate for re
election. He is a young man of model
habits and is in every way worthy of
the fair bride be has won.
The Sentinel joins with their host
of friends in extending congratul
ations and best wishesr
The happy couple were the recip
ients of many valuable presents, in
cluding a hundred piece dinner set
from the brides mother and a quarter
section of Sheridan county land and
a residence and three lots in Hoxie
by the brides father, J. F. Walz.
The last was a complete surprist to
the bride, she not knowing anything
of it until she read it in the county
paper.
Mr. and Mrs. Johnston will make
their future home in Hoxie Hoxie

BIG SHOW DAY
Tha J. H. Eschman World United
Show Coming ta Brighten
Horn dram Exivtanco
The sun peeps over the eastern
hills in a blase of glory. The world
awakens and starts another busy day.
Tiie small boy hies him from his bed
and hurries from home while .the
dew Is still on the grass. The coun
try folks arise before the dawn and
hurry through their chores, don their
Sunday clothes and start for town,
where all about is an air of waiting
expectancy and gathering crowds In
holiday attire. The anxiously await
ed event has come at last Show Day
is here.
With the coming of dawn the cir
cus train pulls into town and at once
commences a scene of hustle and
hurry. "--Orders sharply given and
quickly obeyed by a vast throng of
workers who help to l; unload ' the
trains. Even the elephants are call
ed into 'Service.- All is noise and ex
citement, while all about are specta
tors staring -mth.eagec.eyes aoxf gues
sing at' the many "marvels '"'and won
ders still covered with the" protecting
canvass. '
On. the' show grounds the same
hurry is going on. Acres of canvas
cover the ground, stakes are being
driven, the big tent pulled into place
and In the twinkling of an eye the
large pavilions are raised, while over
all many bright colored banners float
in the soft morning breeze.
Suddenly the bugle calls. Horses
in gay trappings appear from nowhere
apparently. Scores of people in
bright colored costumes, golden mir
rored chariots, zebras and other
strange animals form in line. The
bands in gay uniforms suddenly blare
forth and the parade has started
down the street, which is lined with
eager, happy smiling faces.
This is the daily experience of a
big circus, requiring the most care
ful generalship to accomplish the
seemingly impossible feat of getting
ready for the afternoon performance,
and such are the scenes to be wit
nessed at Wa-Keeney. The J. H.
Eschman world united shpws will
arrive for two performances on Sat
urday, September 23. Adv.
A BLOW TO ARBITRATION
On the insistence of the President,
almost without debate, Congress has
voted to increase the wages of a
group of railway employees.
Possibly wages should have been
Increased, Tha -Star doesn't know.
But neither doe Congress. The Star
does know that such legislation could'
not possibly have been obtained ex
cept in a campaign year. . It is a hu
miliating spectacle.
. By insisting on this law and not
insisting at the same time on an ar
bitration measure, Mr. Wilson is sim
ply inviting other groups to apply for
similar legislative help. He is en
couraging them to discard arbitra
tion and to bring sufficient pressure
on a yielding President to get results.
Arbitration of labor disputes is of
tremendous importance. In the long
run its only alternate is war. The
President's action is the most serious
setback the cause of arbitration has
received in years. Kansas City Star.
Coming on their own private train
of double length cars, the J. H. Esch
man World United Shows are well
prepared to give ns the best of every
thing and from all accounts they will
do so. One day only, afternoon . and

along.
Beef steers Washington county,
Kansas, steers sold at $10.75 today,
short fed steers $10.50, branded year
lings $10.75, among the best cattle
here today. Feeder buying competi
tion helped out on killers, best grass
steers selling up to $8.90, good steers
around $3.00, plain grass steers weigh
ing 1100 lbs $7.00, lighter Kansas and
Qklahoma steers $6.00 to $6.75, Colo-,
tado horned beef steers weighing
1000 lbs at $6.80, grass cows $5.40. to
$6 50, veal calves up to $11.00.
Stockers and Feeders The presence
or "Kansas-' as a strong- buyer this
week promises well for the general,
cattle market from this time on, al
though the yards are full of an
accumulation of two year old steers
and upwards for which not much can '
be done this week, and it is a good
time to buy medium to plain cattle.
A fev fleshy feeders were bought this
morning at $7.75 to $8.90. stock calves
up to $8.25, fancy White Face stock
heifers up to $8.00 but bulk of the
stock cattle and feeders sold at $6.25
to $6.75, inculding good horned Colo
rado twos weighing 850 to 900 lbs - at
$6.40 to $6.65. Stockers and feeders
are sell! g lower than a year ago
while fed cattle are higher than then.
Hogs Receits were 15000 head,
market steady at the opening, order
buyers paying up to $11.05, packers,
$10.95. The close was around 10 low-
er, bulk of sales $10.50 . to $10.95.
Packers are able to gain price con
sessions for the moment, but the
whole situation is remarkably strong,
and hogs are cutting up at an
enormous profit to . packers. Lard
ribs and barrel pork are nealy twice
as high as a year ago, and the margin
above live hogs- is three times as
great as it was a year ago. Of course,
packers have to figure on future
probabilities of the market, but an
advance of a dollar a hundred on live ',
hogs would not equalize prices.
Sheep and Laiabs.Recelpts were
12000 head, and prices were 10 higher,
Western lambs selling up to $11.00
plain Ariaonas $10.25, natives $10.35,
yearling up tip to W.25, .feeding,
lambs id. 75 to $10.35, breeding ewes
$7.00 to $9.40, including a 4 car lot of
young Wyoming breeders weighing',
82 lbs at $9.20. Packers got some
stock direct, bought enroute to the
market, and the whole situation ex
hibits a scramble on the part of kill- -ers
and feeder buyers for material,
that is to say, everything favors the
sellers at this time.
