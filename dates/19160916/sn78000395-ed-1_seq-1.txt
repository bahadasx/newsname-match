PRISON WORK RETARDS
EFFOTS OF LABOR
Organized Workers in that State
Will Co-operate to Close Ft.
Madison Plant.
DUBUQUE, Iowa, Sept. 14.——There
will be no more prison-made brooms
in Illinois. The plant has been
closed and the machinery stored. An
agreement was reached with the gov­
ernor to this effect. It is to be
hoped that «l like agreement can be
reached with tho governor of Iowa
and have this abnoxious business
removed from the walls of Fort
Madison once and for all.
The shipment of prison-made
"brooms into Cedar Rapids recently
seriously interfered with the em­
ployes of a home factory bettering
their condition. And here in Du­
buque the home plant has been se­
riously retarted by the prison-made
product.
The current number of The Broom
Maker has this to say regarding the
situation: "The progress made to­
ward the entire elimination of prison
competetion during the past two
years has been especially gratifying.
Close Broom Plant.
"As an agreement had been se­
cured- with the governor of Illinois
to close the prison broom plant at
Joliet so soon as the stock on hand
had been worked up, which was done
in June,, the machinery from the
factory and stored and no more
brooms are to be made "at the Joliet
prison. In the future all the brooms
u^ed fey the Illinois, State institutions
/Will
be bought of tho Industrial
Home for the Blind, which will still
farther aid the employing broom
maker by removing, in part, this
competition also.
"During the last year a broom
plant has been installed at the Fort
Madison, Iowa, prison. The matter
"was taken up with the manufacturers
of olwa, and it was proposed that the
broom makers of Iowa be organized
and seek the assistance of the Iowa
State Federation of Labor {ind all af­
filiated organizations. Several con­
ferences were had with officers of
the Mid-West Broom Manufacturers'
association, and for a time it seemed
as if something might be accomplish­
ed to have the manufacture of
brooms by the State of Iowa abol­
ished. However the manufacturers
finally decided to have nothing to do
with our organization, and the of­
ficials of the international union felt
that without the c-operation of the
men directly interested the Iowa
broommakers, it would be unfair to
the general membership to stand all
the expense attached to the work of
closing the prison plant.
Obstacle to Factories.
"The Lee Broom & Duster Co.. who
have employed prison labor at the
Linroln, Neb., prison for a number of
years, and are still employing prison
labor, appeared to be the opposing
force that blocked efforts to work
•with the manufacturers along the
lines followed in other states.
Iowa manufacturers thought that
they could bring influence enough
to close the prison shop without the
aid of organized labor. However,
their efforts proved a failure. With
the aid of the organized workers, of
Towa the desired result could be ac­
complished, and so »oon as the men
of Towa decide to do their share the
work will be taken up.
What has been accomplished by
by our organization has been of vast
benefit to the trade, and it is hoped
that the manufacturers will realize
just what has been accomblished for
them and will work with us in the
future to eliminate the manufacture

Dr. RAYMOND V. PHELAN.
In all the garish advertisements that
beckon American men into our army
or our navy, one looks in vain for the
announcements that would make mili­
tary training palatable to a self-re­
specting people. Nowhere does one
read "There is no snobbishness in our
army or our navy," or "The so-called
private is treated like a man, or "you
wiuu have to black no man's boots,"
or "You wiH not have to maintain a
servile attitude toward the supercilious
wife or daughter of any officer," or
"Our army is not maintained to give a
falsa sense of superiority to the of­
ficer class." A really American spirit
was expressed by the two New Jersey
militiamen who resigned because a
sergeant spoke harshly to them. From
the Navy Leagues' camp for women
in Wisconsin came the report some­
time ago that the recruits were mak­
ing good progress except that they
frequently forgot about saluting their
officers. The military salute is pictur­
esque, but if retained at all, why
should it not be modified to require a
simultaneous salutation between two
soldiers of different rank of salute by
him who sees the other first. The
one great objection in the opinion of
the vtriter, to compulsory universal
military training is that in the ab­
sence of compulsion our government

ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION
CANNOT BE TAXED
NEW YORK, Sept. 14.—The sur­
rogate court has ruled that Rocke­
feller's $100,000,000 foundation is a
charitable institution and cannot be
taxed. State Controller Travis will
appeal the decision. He insists that
under this ruling the Rockefellers,
father and stra, could turn over their
billion-dollar fortune to the founda­
tion and thus escape taxation. The
Rockefeller family controls the foun­
dation's board of trustees.
The foundation has been repeatedly
attacked as a colossal attempt to con­
trol many activities, Including educa­
tion and free thought, under the guise
of "charity" and that because of its
extended scope it should be controlled
by law.
MANY INCOMPETENT LAWYERS.
CHICAGb, Sept. 14.—While the

in addressing the annual conference,
acknowledged that this union, too, had

Now a word as to two of the effects of its adoption,
if it is carried. It seems to us they have not been
given due prominence by those' who are considering
only the technical financial management of the city.
The taxes that will be levied under this amend­
ment can be spent for public improvements only. That
means the employment of a large amount of labor,
and we all know that the labor outlay in all such im­
provements is almost wholly local. Generally, the
material is the smaller part of the total cost. If the
entire three mills are levied to pay the city's portion
of the cost of public improvements, the total cost of
such improvements will aggregate around $800,000
per year for the city's portion is about one-sixth of
the total cost. Most of that $800,000 will go to labor
account in some form. That means that it will be
just that much additional income to our workingmen
and, through them, to our grocers, butchers, clothiers
and other retailers. In other words, it is not a com­
munity loss, but a transfer from the pockets of those
who pay the taxes to those who do the work, furnish
the materials and feed and clothe the people of Du
luth.
Another consideration is this: This- money will

IN FEDERATION HOME
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.--C. W.
Bowerman, secretary parliamentary
committee British Trades Union con­
gress, has forwarded President Gomp
ers a photograph of the piece of
marble sculpture, entitled "The
Triumph of Labor," which •will be in­

expression by English trade unionists.
The work will be enclosed in a frame
of English oak, with a. g^lt

of the marble will be 6x3 feet.
Secretary Bowerman writes:
"The central figure is symbolic of
the triumph and is standing Upon an

jects achieved by labor. Behind this
figure is a great procession -without
beginning or end. On one side are

points direct to one purpose, viz., that
it can feel proud that its members can

Will it be by legislative action or will
it be its rapid development which will

of our best thinkers have an idea that
it will be a combination of both. Past

the New-aWrk, Hart­

ants in a liability and restitution suit
for more than $160,000,000 in the
federal court by Massachusetts stock­
holders of the road.
It is charged that the defendants
conspired unlawfully to acquire con­
trol of corporations, expending the
railroad's moneys, funds and credit to
the amount of $130,000,000 and caus­
ing the stockholders an actual loss
and damage exceeding $133,000,000.
It is declared that rate fixing and
the elimination of competition caused
the stockholders a loss of $2,000,000
that $1,500,000 was. expended in a
publicity campaign "to deceive and
mislead that a loss of $3,000,000 was
caused through operating steamships
secretly controlled, under charges act­
ually less than dost that $3,000,000
was "misapplied" in large payments to
legislators in New England. and
Canada and in contributing to political
campaign funds.
The suit has attracted the attention
of trade unionists because of the act­
ivity of C. L. Bardo, general manager
of the New York, New Haven & Hart­
ford railroad, in opposing the eight
hour demand of his train service em­
ployes. Mr. Bardo is a member of
tbe national conference committee of
the railways, and in signed statements,
published in newspapers during July,
declared that the eight-hour day was
really a demand for higher^ wages, and
that "the railroads feel that they have
no right to grant a wage preferment
without a clear mandate from a public
tribunal."
Trade unionists say Mr. Bardo was
not so solicitous about "the dear pub­
lic" when his colleagues were looting
and wrecking this railroad.

One other mportant question is be­

bor will take on tariff reform. It
seems that some change in this line
must and will take place in the new
readjustment of our Industrial work­
ers' system. The future points very
much to the blending together of the
French and British nations in such a
way that will be beneficial to the
workers of both these nations. I will
point out the fact of iron ore alone.

rot be spent for any public purpose which does not
?£sult in a permanent asset of the city. It is not like
tine money that goes for police and fire protection, or
for salaries of city officials. The pavements and
sewers, for which alone this 3-mill tax can be used,
will remain for years to come, for the use and protec­
tion of the people, and for the better apparance of the
city. It is not a waste. We are getting value re­
ceived these days for all money spent under the di­
rection of the Department of Public Works. One rea­
son the people generally seem to favor this amendment
is, that they believe commissioner Bert Farrell will
get value received for every dollar the city pays out
in his department.
Unless the people want the improvements, they
cannot be made. If they are made, the money will be
spent honestly and efficiently. If it is spent honestly,
the most of it will go for labor. If it is spent effi­
ciently, the city will really get the benefit of it, not
for one year, but for many years to come.
For these reasons it is the duty of every working
man in the city to vote for the proposed amendment to
.the city charter at the special election to be held Tues­
day, September 26. Don't be misled in your course
by any citizen who would spitefully embarass the
city. Vote for the amendment on its merits.

crowd of 8,1)00 persons attending the
Labor day celebration. She applauded

threatened railroad strike and its
passage of the federal child laibor law,

proof of the growing, power of the

Goods Should Be Exchanged.
Now we turn to Britain and her

(1914) and we find that out of 10,
000,000 ton9 of iron ore bought
abroad she only bought 300,000 tons
from France. Now, France lis a de­
pendant nation on her coal require­
ments and we observe France took
13,000,000 tons of coal from Britain.
So here are two important facts:
France buys coal and sells ore, Brit­
ain sells coal and buys ore, both in.al­
most identical proportions. It seems
that nature herself points out the fact
that these goods.should be exchanged
between those nations who are so near
to each other. Both iron and coal are
essential raw material for metallurgy

Solidity of Unions Shown
Great Advantage In Rail­

While our opponents "charge the
railroad brotherhoods with attempt­
ing to "intimidate" congress because
that body hastily passed an eight-hour
law under suspension of rules, the
people of this country will not sustain
this charge. Neither will the mem­
bers of congress, in my opinion, be­
lieve it.
Rather should the railroad man­
agers congratulate themselves that
congress was in session, for the na­
tional law makers made it possible for
the managers to "save their faces" by
making mandatory the identical pro­
posals of President Wilson1 that the
managers had formerly rejected.
Fail to Interpret Spirit.
It was another case of employers
failing correctly to interpret the spirit
of their employes, the determination
of these workers to secure a normal
workday. President Wilson was alert
to this spirit and to the fact that the
time for discussing the eight-hour day
is passed, when he said:
"It has been adjudged by tihe
thought and experience of recent
years a thing upon which society is
justified in insisting."
But the railroad managers, main­
taining the same attitude they have
assumed when laws intended to pro­
tect life and limb are favored, again
showed their blindness, and stood on
the edge of a precipice until congress
hastily devised methods to save them
from themselves by writing into the
statutes the proposal of President
Wilson.

strates the tremendous power of or­

STRIKE FOR INCREASE

Veterans Get Together and Fojj
Wage Schedule For All
Grades
A movement is under way in New
York, according to advices received
from that city, to organize extra
workers engaged in the manufacture
of moving pictures. These extras are
known in the theatrical world as
"supers' and already nearly 10,000
men and women have become identi­
fied with the new union.
Throughout the United States the^re
are probably several hundred thou­
sands of these "supers" who work at
irregular periods for the producers of
moving pictures. in all likelihood
the organization started in New York
City will in time extend to other ci­
ties where moving picture studios are
to be found.
In Gotham the "supers" have
threatened to strike unless they are
given an increase in wages. At pre­
sent they are being paid about $1.50
and they l.ave arranged a schedule of
prices which they a3k the producers
to meet. Ten thousand strong, th,ey
have sworn vengeance on the agents
who dole them out to the moving
picture directors and have sought the
aid of Hugh Frayne of the American
Federation of Labor.
Agents Held Responsible.
No longer will they .consent-to be

they say, for the i-ian must submit
to all the hard knocks a hero choose
to give him—for a man who can wear
a dress suit without looking like a
waiter, or even for a truly realistic
tramp or 1'iug.
Louis Stern, the "super" Garibaldi
who has united the freedom-seekers
and is leading them in their fight,
expressed himself in bitter terms yes­
terday.
"The 'super' business was pretty
good at one time," said he, "but it is
now all shot to pieces. These agents
have got no heart at all. Formerly
these 'supers' got as high as $10 a
day, and now the agents get the $10
and give the 'supers' $1.50."
After consultation with veterans
who bear the scars of years of
"supering," the following wage scale
has been decided upon:
Worth More "Dressed Up."
1. Any "super" called upon to do
duty in a dress suit is to get $5 a day.
2. Any "super" who is called upon
to do bumps is to get $7.50 a day
3. Any "super" who is called
upon to work in civilian dress, $3.50.
4. A mob of "supers" in numbers
from 1 to 15 are to get $5 a day per
"super" from 15 to 50, $4 a day
from 50 to 100, $3 a day, and over
that number, $2.50 a day.
5. In a scene, that calls for sum­
mer apparel the "super" is to get $5
a day. A tuxedo or walking suit calls
for the same amount.
6. Tramps or gangsters are to get
$2 a piece a day up to 50 in number
over that, $3.
7. Every studio is obliged to feed
the "supers."
8. Night work calls for $3.50 a
day, the hours to be from 6:30 p. m»
until 2 a. m. In the day time the
hours to be from 8:30 a. m. until
5:30 p. m. Overtime calls for dou­
ble pay.
of that, great far-seeing statesman,
James G. Blaine, was the bringing in
of what was, then, anew word, known
ai reciprocity, which the United
States adopttl as a legislative meas^
ure which brought to the people of
Cuba a pure and wholesome bread
which soon brought to tjhem a new
physical strength and energy and
which soon built them up into re*
newed activity, wihch was the result
of their national liberties. I was in
the Keystone state at that time and
there was no man that met with as
much ridicule as did James G. Blaine.
But years after the poor people of
Cuba, who bad only their poor un«
wholesome tilack bread to eat, rose up
to call that man blessed* because he
