JUAREZ, Mex., via El Paso, Sept.
1C.—Throughout Mexico, the national
Independence day is being observed
today with historical ceremonies.
Last night at 11 o'clock the celebra
tion began in this city with the ring
ing of bells in commemoration of the
ringing of the liberty bell by the
priest patriot Hidalgo in the village
of Dolores, Guanajuato in 1810. Close
watch was kept on all gatherings by
officials of the defacto government,
as independence day is a favorite
time for demonstrations against the
government.
Patriotic addresses were made by
the mayor and other officials in the
plaza after which fireworks were set
off and the people shouted "viva
Mexico," "viva Hidalgo."
Today there were more addresses,
singing of national airs by the school
children and parades. The city was
decorated in the national colors.
American-Mexican 'Negotiations.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 16.—
American-Mexican negotiations reach
ed a delicate point today. Whether
Carranza is willing and more import
antly, able to patrol the border, is a
vital question upon which negotiations
are now turning.
As far as surface indications go,
the first chief probably will take over
the duties which have developed upon
General Pershing's column. But the
fact that his representatives have not
committed ttiemselves to such a
scheme, make negotiations at this
dtage extremely important and deli
cate.
As matters now stand, the Ameri
can commissioners want Carranza to
do most of tho patrolling through a
sort of Mexican police. This varies
from the original proposition in that
what the Mexicans then proposed,
called for a joint international police.
Now the Americans want Carranza to
establisn a strong force. Today in
the absence of the Mexican commis
sioners, the American conferees indi
cated their belief that there is no
sign in sight.
The Mexicans have despaired of
getting a loan from Wall street and
havo decided to turn to the small
bankers for their loan.
Auto Thieves Trust.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
CHICAGO, Sept. 16.—State's Attor
ney Hoyne was confident today he
had taken the first step toward
breaking up the nation-wide trust of
automobile thieves as a result of in
dictments returned yesterday for Ira
Bond, said to be a Minneapolis mil
lionaire: Len Nutter and William
Ravenkamp, known as "Big Bill."
Charges against the .men were
grand larceny and receiving stolen
property. It was said the syndicate
has stolen 2,000 cars in Chicago this
year. Charges are based on alleged
confessions of Earl Harris and Ed
ward Ernhanj who said they were
hired to steal antos.

ITALIANS A£E, WINNING
Gains Made by Assailants of Teu
tons, With Bulgarian Forces
In Full Retreat
Today.
[B Ed L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, Sept. 16.—Allied soldiers
have swung forward on three great
battle fronts in the last twenty-four
hours, but have suffered reverses in
southeastern Rumania.
The British advanced their center
to within less than four miles of Ba
paume before slackening their great
ouensive north of the bomme to per
mit the moving up of heavy artillery.
General Haig announced this after
noon the villages of Courcelette, Mar
tinpulch and Flers are now firmly in
British hands and tnat 2,800 German
captives were taken in yesterday'3
fighting. The loss of these three vil
lages was officially admitted in Ber
lin.
In Macedonia the Bulgarian right
wing ig now in full retreat toward
the Serbo-Greek frontier, according to
official dispatches from Salonika to-'
day. The Russians and French, co
operating with the Serbians, are fol
lowing up Thursday's successes and
have already driven the Bulgars back
more than twelve miles. An official
report said that troops of the three
allied nations have recaptured th'e
Important Greek town of Florena. The
British have resumed the offensive on
the left wing, attaching villages held
by the Bulgars after crossing the
•Struma river under Are.
The Italians hnve resumed their
great drive toward Trieste and are
reported to have broken through the
Austrian line at several places. Ten
thousand Austrians have been killed,
captured or wounded said a Rome dis
patch today.
The extent of the Teutonic victory
over the Russians and Rumanians in
southeastern Rumania is in doubt.
Sofie dispatches today asserted that
the Russo-Pumanlans have abandoned
the whole district north of Dobric and
are falling back rapidly toward the
Danube to escape capture. The kais
er telegraphed the kaiserine from im
perial headquarters in the east that
Turks, Bulgars and Germans have
won a decisive victory over the
Russo-Rumanians. Official" dispatches
from Bucharest admitted a retirement,
but it did not confirm the claim made
at Sofia of a general rtereat on a
seventy mile front.
Italians on Offensive.
ROME, Sept. 16.—Italian troops are
now on the offensive on the whole
Isonzo front fipm Goritz to the sea

Individual Unions of New

Street Oar Men's
Trouble.
TO TIE UP ALL LINES
If This Plan Fails, Then General
Strike of 700,000 Men In
All Trades Is Con
templated
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Sept. 16.—Driving
against "the Morgan interests" which
they charge are opening a general
fight against unionism in the present
transit strike, the Central Federated
union of New York today submitted
to individual unions, recommendations
for a sympathetic strike and for a
boycott of subway, elevated and sur
face cars.
The resolution adopted recommends
"as a preliminary to the general
strike' that longshoremen, boatmen,
teamsters, engineers, firemen and
plumbers, whose labor is keeping the
traction cars running, stop work im
mediately.
"We guarantee to support tliem to
the end," the resolution said.
"If they call out trade unions, it
won't affect us. We have large sup
plies of coal in store and can get
more," was the reply of President
Shonts, of the Interborough, to the
strike threat.
Using the argument that "the
Morgan interests" are determined to
crush unionism, six trades unions are
already said to have authorized their
leaders to call strikes at their dis
cretion, according to one report to
day. The machinist's, union, with 20,
000 members, has ordered a referen
dum vote on the strike, it is said, and
longshoremen are scheduled to meet
tomorrow at 1 o'clock for a similar
vote.
Police reroorts today showed thirty
seven persons Injured and two men
killed on traction lines affected by the
strike in the last twenty^fcrur hours.
Thirty-two were injured in a rear end
collision on the Third avenue line at
53rd street when a train driven by a
strike breaker struck a train stand
ing at the station there.
Preliminary plans, on which the un
ions affected are voting today, provide
for strikes involving about 80,000 men.
These strikes are intended to tie up
the traction lines by cutting off their
power ttfrough shortage of fuel, walk
outs of engineers and bringing about
strikes among all workmen engaged
in labor contributing to operation of
the lines. If this does not have the
desired efTect, a general strike affect
ing 700,000 workers—both men and
women—In Greater New York is con
templated. To meet this threat, em
ployers are said to be laying plans to
bring charges of criminal conspiracy
against leaders who call or encourage
sympathetic strikes.
Police patrols have been established
along the roofs of buildings on Ninth
avenue, but despite this trains were
bombarded with bricks, bottles and
stones early today. One woman was
seriously Injured.
The bodies of two men were found
on the tracks of elevated lines early
today. A track walker found the body
of a laborer on the Third avenue ele
vated, but had no idea of how he came
to his death. The second body was
found badly mangled on the Eighth
avenue^ elevated. He was identified
by a health certificate on his body as
Anthony Ritt, a cook employed by a
firm of strike breakers.

Order. 1
[United Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.—The
British blockade has again become a
matter of first diplomatic importance
in the United States. New orders by
the British government, which so far
as considered here are viewed as en
croachments on the rights of neu
trals, threaten to fan into a live Is
sue the smoldering dissatisfaction
this country has felt over the whole
blockade question. One effect of the
new orders, it is agreed, will be a
more insistent demand that this gov

powers voted by the recent congress.
