U. S. TAKES UP
LATEST BRITISH
BLOCKADE ORDER
Seek to Learn What Commod
ities Are Included,
CONSIDER TREATY TERMS
Restriction May Violate Con
vention of 1815,
WASHINGTON, Sept. lo - The
state department sought today to learn
through diplomatic ilunnels precisely
what commodities are included in
reat Mrilam's latest blockade ord;r
restricting shipments from the I'nited
States to Holland and the Scandinavian
countries. If adion is found to shut
off any great quantity of American
trade with these neutral countries, it
doubtless will be regarded seriously by
this government.
Retaliation Possible.
Interest in the effect of the order is
enhanced at this time since President
Wilson was granted authority hy re
cent legislation to retaliate against
countries interfering unduly with
American romrnerre.
Msy Violate Treaty.
The stale department also is inter
ested in asiertaining whether the re
ported agreement between ( ireat Hritain
and I-ranee for the exchange of commo
dities whose importation from other
countries is forbidden, does not violate
the Hritish-Amcrican commercial trea
ty of IKI5.
The American embassy at London
was requested to confirm published re
port of the new order and explain Us
effect on American commerce.
Blacklist Modified.
American Consul General Skinner
cabled today thai the blacklist order
had been modified to permit Hritish
marine insurance companies to under
write insurance on property of black
listed United Stales concerns. It does
not apply to Philippine or I'orlo Rico
concerns on the blacklist. The mod
ification officials consider of benefit
pincipally to Briiuh insurance ccrni
psMiies, hut it will alto aid blacklisted
American conrrrns in moving their
merchandise by allowing them lo ob
tain Hritish tinderwrilings. Offirials
here believe the real motive is to en
able Hritish marine underwriters tn
bold American insurance business and
not lose it through operation of the
blacklist.
