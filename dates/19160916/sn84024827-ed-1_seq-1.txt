HOPE OF JOINT ARMY
BLASTED BY BLISS
Mexicans Must Replace Persh

draws Brigandage Is Far
From Ended.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW LONDON1. Conn.. Sept. 15.
A suggestion that the Mexican govern
ment create a constabulary for border
duty similar to the rurales of the Diaz
regime was made today during a brief
session of the American Mexican com
mission concluding the second week
of its conferences. Apparently the
plan for a joint police force previous
ly discussed was abandoned as im
practicable after the commissioners
had conferred with General Blis3, as
sistant chief of staff of the United
States army.
The three Mexican commissioners
left for New York tonight to Join in
the c?bration there tomorrow of the
Mexican national holiday, arranged
by consular officials. Jno. R. Mott. of
the American commission is absent
- on personal bus'fiess but his asso
ciates. Secretary Lane and Judge Gray j
are devoting their time to a'stndy of!
reports of the border and the interior1
transmitted by the state department.
Withdrawal Conditional
General Bliss, it was learned, made
the commission a dispassionate state
ment of the situation he believed
would follow General Pershing's with
drawal from Mexico before a properly
constituted constabulary is created to
relieve his troops. It is understood
he pointed out problems in the way
of an effort to create a dual police
force.
Mexico' Obligations
There is reason to believe that the
American commissioners have sought
to impress their Mexican conferees
with the view that Mexico must rec
ognize responsibility for the depreda
tions Her nationals 'may tommit on
the border if good relations are to be
unimpaired. The whole question of
creating a non-military police force to
hunt down bandits in their hill re
treats is based on this feeling, and it
is believed the suggestion that the
Carranza government undertake this
task for itself as an international ob
ligation, came from the Mexican com
missioners. The theory is that a
mounted police force could be dispos
ed in small detachments through the
bandit infected regions, thereby pre
venting any large gatherings of the
latter. Moving swiftly and unhamper
ed by women camp followers, it is be
lieved a military force could do much
toward putting a stop to brigandage.

NEW YORK, Sept 15. On Septem
ber 1 the staff correspondent 'of the
Associated Press obtained the inter
view with King Constantine of Greece
that follows:
(It is impossible to say which of the
censorships through which it passed
held up the dispatch. The interview
was given about the time the entente
allied fleet was taking position at Pi
raeus the port of Athens, and revolu
tionary 'outbreaks were reported tak
ing place in Macedonia.)
TATOIUJ, Greece, Sept 1, (via
Paris, Sept 1512:30 p. m.) King
Constantine received the correspon
dent of the Associated Press in his
summer palace here and spoke of the
present situation with the utmost
frankness although refusing to be di
rectly qUtoted.

Greece is ready to join the Entente
allies whenever she could see her way
the fate almost certain to overtake
more than a million Greeks living in
Asia Minor and Thrace in the event of
Greece finding herself engaged in hos

that while those' who judged Greece
and himself harshly for what is re
garded as inaction, they gave no
thought tj the prospect of condemning
to the lot of the Armenians, Greek
women and children caught in the
toils of the Turks.
The king said the world regarded
with callousness, due to ignorance the
real situation concerning the condition
confronting Greece for bargaining
when the Greeks aPone could know
and estimate the frightful' cost of a
war to Greece. He laid stress on the
difference between Greece's situation
and Rumania's in this respect
Quite frankly the king admitted the
presence of Bulgarians in Macedonia
and Rumania's entry to the war would
greatly complicate the situation, con
stituting a new element which easily
might alter the premises upon which
the policy of Greece hitherto has been
these new elements had to be duly
considered and weighed before Greece
would be justified in changing her po

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15. In the
absence of information detailing what
commodities are affected by the new
British restrictions on American trade
with Holland and the Scandinavian
countries officials here are uncertain
Just how heavily American exporters
will suffer. Steps to obtain this in
formation have been taken tonight
and it was stated should any illegal '
extension of restrictive measures be
revealed. It would be regarded as
serious development in the controver-
sy over the legality of allied block-

LONDON. Sept IV Smashing the
German line on a front of six nil!e9
of the Sorame in France, the British
forces have made probably the most
notable advance since the Anglo-
French offensive began July 1. Three
towns, two woods and the possession
of nearly all the high ground between
Combles and the Pozierres Bapaume
road fell to the British.
Not only did the Germans lose the
points but the British drive Imperils
the Combles and Thievpal positions,
at either end of the British front. Th
gaining of the high ground north of
Combles gives the British command
of the approaches to Bapaume.
Drive 2 Miles Deep
The advance on the northern end of
the front was for a distance of two
miles. Courcelette. east of Thievpal
and north of the Pozierres-Bapaume
road, and Martinpuich. south of the
road, fell Into the hands of General
Haig's men. Farther south they took
Fleurs and the High Wood, making
secure their possession of Ginrhy. The
Bouleaux wood, north of Combles. al
so was lost to the Germans.
Finest Teutons Routed
The Germans under Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria fought stubborn
ly to hold their ground. London says,
and the fighting was severe all along
the line.
More than 2300 prisoners were tak-
: i by the British.
Aiding the British in the encircle
ment of Combles. the French have
taken additional trenches north of Le
Priez farm.
South of the river three German
trenches near Bery-en-Santerre were
taken by the French who also cap
tured 200 prisoners. Berlin claims
the repulse of British attacks south
east of Thievpal and of French efforts
between Rancourt and the Somme.
The official statement admits the less
of Le Priez farm west of Rancourt.
Allies Rout Bulgars
In northern Macedonia, the British
French and Serbian armies have
gained additional successes breaking
down the Bulgarian defense on the
center and on the left wing. French
troops took Bulgarian positions a half
mile deep on a front of one mile. West
of Lake Ostrovo the Serbians captur
ed Malkanidoso. The British attacked
west of the Vardar and also gained
ground.
Retreat 12 Miles
Unofficially, it is reported the Bul
garians retreated twelve miles In
front of the entente rush and Athens
reports the abandonment of Kastoria
by the Bulgarians. Berlin says en
tente allies in the Moglentea sector
of the Vardar were repulsed.
Italians Capture 2100
The Italians have begun a new
drive toward Triest. Lines of Austri
an entrenchments east of the Vallone
have been taken. Rom? reports to
gether with more than 2100 prisoners.
Vienna admits Italian advances on
the Isonzo front but declares these
were looked upon as a minor fact.
Violent fighting Is In progress in
Turkish Armenia.
There has been no change in the
situation on the eastern front from
the Carpathians to Riga.
Constantinople reports the British
acain on the offensive In Mesopotamia
following long inactivity of the forces
along the Euphrates and on the Tigris
below Kut-el-Amara. The Turkish
war office claims to haTe repulsed th
attacks in one of which the British
