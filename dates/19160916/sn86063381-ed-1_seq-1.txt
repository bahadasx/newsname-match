BRAZIL'S CENSUS IS
PADDED OVER 14,000,000
(By United Press)
Rio re Janeiro, Brazil, Sept. 16.
The Brazilian government has just
issued an official estimate placing
the country's population at 26,542,
000 souls. Experts here agree that
this is all right up to about 12,000,-
000. Beyond that point they say the
estimate includes the Indian inhab
ntants of a vast interior region
which no white man has ever seen.
Consequently they declare that 14,
542,000 of the estimate is a mere
wildcat guess.

writer of verse. Mr. Brown has writ
ten several poems in regard to Bel

"Northern Beltrami County," is as
follows: Here is the clime of nature's calm,
A peaceful land of growing wealth,
The air is purea living balm
Giving to all both life and health.
Thru all the earth has nature roved,
Crowning her path with blissful
gems
Passing this way she sweetly posed,
And clothed our land with diadems*
She gave the restful gleaming green,
Clothed th pine-wood and the vale,
The waving grassa welcome scene,
Doth please the heart like fairy
tale.

PRESIDENT WILSON
Fargo, K. D.. Sept. 16.Congress-
man H. T. Helgesen, who has just re

night in an interview here that Presi
dent Wilson's failure to handle the
railroad strike situation when it first
came to his attention a full year ago,
and the failure also of Chairman
Adamson of the houseinterstate com
mittee was withqfit dfefenee.
"Theiaeue that goes before the
American public as the result of the
passage! of the Adamson bill lis that
of whether we shall have compulsory
arbitration of compulsory legislation.
"I believe they favor compulsory
arbitration.
"I voted for the Adamson bill be
cause it afforded a way out of the
strike and the strike would be of
tremendous seriousness in the con
gested districts of the east, far more
serious than we of the west can ap
preciate. Within a week people
would, have been dying of starvation
and probably when a few tens of
thousands had died we would have
had a civil war. And I do not speak
in the figurative sense either."
Mr. Helegesen is confident of
Hughes' election, declaring that the
candidate of the Republicans made a
great hit in Maine.
