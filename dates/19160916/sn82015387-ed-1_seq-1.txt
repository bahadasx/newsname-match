The election went of very quietly
throughout the parish and there was
a comparatively small vote cast in
most wards. While the figures ob
tained are not official, they may be
regarded as very nearly correct, be
ing obtained from the different poll
ing places after the vote was count

Sanders' majority is 295, Ponder 4
having carried but one precinct.
Simmons beat Grantham by 193,
having carried Grantham's home
ward by one vote.
Haints beat Brock by a plurality
of 257 votes and Moise by a plurality
of 72 votes, in St. Tammany parish.
In Washington parish, as far as ob
taliable, the vote was: IBrock 816,
Heintz 536, Moise 173. Heints and 4
Brock will be in the second primary. I
First reports placed Sanders' ma
lority in the district at something (

this majority until it decreased to <
300. At this time it is not certain
just what his majority is, but it is
quite certain that he has been elect- I

rant Drilling Well.
INDICATIONS SAID TO
I BE FAVORABLE TO OIL
I Well Is Now 2750 Feet and
Rock Is Being Drilled.
Oil May Be Beneath.
1 At the meeting of the Association
of Commerce last Monday it was de
cided to defer the printing of the
booster book until pictures could be
taken of exhibits .nd stock at the
fair grounds in October. It was con
sidered that these pietures would be
good advertising for the parish. t
Mr. W. H. .Martin, secretary of the
Meridian Oil & Gas Co., now drilling
the oil well at Sulphur Springs Ad
dition to Covtngton, appeared before
the Association and made th' follow
ing appeal with reference to the well
now being drilled:
Covingtonu La., Sept; 12, 1916.
I hereby take this method of ad
vising you of the condition of affairs
relative to the oil- proposition of
which we made every fftort, ilnanci
ally and physesally, to" make an. oil
field of in yout- parish, which, as you
know,, If succesful, every individual
will .reatly t eneft.; We had not an
ticiphted such costly operations, as it
was represented to us that the drill
or of the previous well had encoun
tered oil sand at 1700 feet. Wheth
er we missed the stratum, or the
-driller erred, or misrepresentp4 con
ditions, we cannot say. However, wt
found nothing of value at that depth,
but did get a fine showing of oil at
2525 feet, which is the best indica
tion of more at a lower depth. We
are now at the same depth of the-old
well and in the same rock in which
their pipe was twisted off. We have
already penetrated the rock 64 feet
and still drilling in :t. Our driller,
who has had,25 years experience in
the oil -fields, thinks very- favorably
of the formation and feels confident
when 'the rock is drtde4 -through we
will encounter the oi: sand. Ills
confidence is based on the fact of
having seen the flow of oil from the
old well in 1912.
We can drill only a few feet per
day and our expenses are apprexi
mately $35.00 pa" day. Oar people
have stood firm wath ud fos ive eia
secutive wells, but tqey are begin
ing to be lisca.,tented, especially
at that the Corl'gt,'lui peopve show
siiuh little interest an,. :a. efforts to
Sassist in the enterurise, which w'lj
mean so much ,,~ them If sUCeesftal.
We are very anxioa to dri!l ,WiS
feet if necessary ;o make a. roier3irh
test, but it wil be intpos:b:e to drill
much further, unless so'm inov.e b
made on your part to stir the coni
dence of our people. Hence we here
by appeal to you for your financial
assistance as well as your co-opera
tion towards awakening some inter
est in your community and thereby
reawake the 'enthuslatm which' our
people have allowed to become dor
mant. You' realize that should we
quit, you have lost your last oppor
tunity of ever having your territory
developed for oil and gas. So do not
allow this appeAl to go to the wiste
basket unheeded, but come. up and
subscribe for whatever yoe can pu
sibly aford and we will do our part
towards a suceseafut termination. -

deep drilling to get big wleEs in
Southern Louisiana and Texas, which
wans confilrmed last week by a te
