A resolution recommending the

building, say the resolution comes
as a surprise to the in.

Other resolutions recommended
an amendment to the state con
stitution providing for n commis
sion form of government for
counties; that all suits to test
the validity of tax assessments be
begun before Oct. 1 of each year;
that commissioners consider the
question whether tuberculosis hos
pitals should be under county or
state control, and recommending
that if the present law is kept in
force the state pay a larger pro
portion of their support; legisla

the affairs of tlie common
schools; that the present arrange

With election of officers, re
ports of committees, and final
addresses, tbe commissioners and
engineers will bring their meeting
to a close Saturday afternoon, and
turn their attention to pleasure.
Both bodies will banquet at

and leave the Tacoma hotel at 8
o'clock Sunday morning for an
all-day trip to the mountain.
Spokane has extended an mvi
tation to the joint convention for
next year; and it was regarded
Saturday morning as certain that
the invitation would be accepted.
Predictions in advance of the i
commissioners' election were that
W. H. McVay of Spokane, present
vice president, will be president!
for the coming year, and W. Scott j
Coe of Klickitat county, secretary'
and treasurer. The vice president,'
It was said, would probably be a 1

explained to the engineers hy
George Milton Savage, president
of the Washington Paving Co.
"The present method of award
ing contracts puts a premium on
fraud and dishonesty," he said,
"as the only thing required to
secure a contract is a low bid and
the ability to furnish the bonds,
and many contracts are taken on
which the only profit possible is
by heating the specifications.

A REAL PROGRESSIVE
What with a democrat such as Jl'oodroiv Wilson in the
White House and a few more republicans like Hiram
Johnson and Miles Poindexter in the capital building,
the . 'nited States should hare a real progressive adminis
tration during the next few years.
This paradox is strikingly suggested by the current is
sue of Collier's Weekly, in which appears an article con
taining an authoritative statement of President Wilson's
plans, in the event of his re-election, with regard to the
hig, vital problems of the day.
Commenting editorially on Wilson's attitude toward
such questions as the tariff and tbe modification of the
Sherman Anti-Trust law. Collier's has this to say:
"The truth is tbat in this, as in most parts of this state
ment of President Wilson's views, he is closer to the pro
gressive than to any other party. Indeed, this is true of
President Wilton's whole position.
"J lis program ami policies, both (luring tbe recent past
md as now announced for the future, are such as to com
mend him much more to the progressive party than to
either of the other two.

Twenty thousand longshoremen

the first workers to respond to
the strike call.
Labor leaders declare that
these men will be followed by
26,000 machinists, who will strike
before night.

small.
Maybe you never thought
nlxiiit it before, hut you will
find few police officers who
do not wear oversized shoos.
He 11us been a member of
the department for eight
years, hut he is almost a
"civilian chief," at that.
For during his service he
has never "walked a heat" or
worked as a detective.
It is this active leg-work
hy polin-iiii-n that swells
their pedal extremities.
Smith's first employment was
that of clerk for the police de
partment.
While employed as clerk he
took interest in the new identifi
cation system invented by 11. Ber
ti I ion of Paris, and studied the
plan.
When Tacoma began to con
sider the installation of a Bertil
lon outfit at police headquarters.
Officer Smith was on hand with a
complete knowledge of the work.
He went to Portland to study
tinder the Identification man
there, and surprised that Individ
ual by demonstrating that he
knew even more than Portland
about M. Bertlllon's finger print
research.
Smith developed one of the
most complete catalogue systems
of criminals' finger prints to be
found in the west.

"I believe in the merit system

"A police department should
