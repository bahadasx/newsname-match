CENTRAL FLORIDA
CIIAMBl
R OF COMMERCE
Proposed at the' IV
feting of the Board
of Trade
.ast Night V
.A Central Florida chamber of com
merce was proposed at the meeting of
the Marion countyboard of trade last
night. Mr, H. W.Weathers, who re
cently attended the! meeting of the re-
ail division of tpe South Florida
Chamber of Commerce in Tampa, be-
ieves that Qcala and Marion county
and the towns, citfes and counties ad
jacent should have?an organiaztion for
the purpose of pfomoting the inter
ests of this section of the state. Mr.
Weathers thinks that the interests of
Central Florida ae in many ways
different from other sections of the
state. ,'.!,;
Mr. Weathers' proposal was unani
mously approved, $nd L. R. Trammell,
secretary of the board, will get in
touch with the various , towns and
cities, asking for their co-operation.
Mr. Weathers pointed out that Cen
al Florida has a different form of
agriculture, and that even the climate
is "different. He spoke very enthus-
iastically of the sp
rit of co-operation
animating the menlbers of the South
Florida Chamber of Commerce.

MAXWELL FACTORIES BREAK
RECORD FOR PRODUCTION
Turns Out 532 Car$ for"Shipment on
Banner Day Production 100 Per
Cent Greater than Last Year
The Maxwell Motor company, Inc.,
broke all its records for production,
when 532 cars were turned out of -its
big Detroit plant hn Saturday, Aug.
26th. While this Is the biggest day
the company ever experienced in the
volume of its output of outomobiles,
it exceeded the day previous by only
a. slight margin. On Friday, August
25th, 501 automobiles were turned out
of the Detroit factory.
This is only an indication of the
great volume of business that k be
ing done by the tlaxwell company.
There has been an?increase of 100 per
cent in the daily output of the com
pany. The average production at the
Oakland avenue plant in Detroit is
now 400 cars a day and hasbeen for
the last month. Ayear ago the aver
age was only 200 cars a day.
A great increa'selin the demand for
Maxwell cars followed the generous
reduction in priceson the touring car
and roadster thatt became effective
July 1st last andithat the factories
are able to meet he demand is due
to the fact that increased manufac
turing facilities have recently been
installed. 0
All Maxwell cars are assembled in
the plant at Detroit while most of the
parts are manufactured in the com
pany's factories atsDayton, Ohio, and
Newcastle, Indiana; The factories at
Dayton and Newcastle are now sup
plying the Detroit; plant with 400
complete units, every day.
The recent addition of a new pro-j
gressive assembly Jtrack and a new
body assembly track has enabled the
Detroit factory to turn out cars at an
increased speed. Tiiere are now two
progressive assembly tracks and two
body tracks, where before there was
only one of each.
About 120,000 cars wil be turned
out of the Maxwell factories this year.
Approximately 60,000 cars were man
ufactured last year and the increased
production is ample evidence of the
growing popularity of the Maxwell
product.
Most of the cars turned out in the
two banner production days were
touring cars and roadsters, although
a number of the enclosed types put
cut by the Maxwell was included in
the allotment. s

Inland Waterways, Said Admiral Ben
son, to the Atlantic Association,
are of First Importance
(Associated Press)
Philadelphia, Sept. 16. Construc
tion of a great system of inland wa
terways and coastal canals for com
mercial use in time of peace and to
meet an imperative need in war was
advocated by Admiral Benson, chief
oi naval operations, in a" speech here
last night before the Atlantic Deeper
Waterways Association. The value to
the United States of such a system,
the admiral declared was sufficient
from both an economic and military
point of view to' justify a bond issue
to help pay the cost of construction.
Admiral Benson reminded the con
vention .of the . recently threatened
railroad strike, pointing out how it
would have effected progress and pre
paredness of the nation's first line de
cense.
The industrial advantages of the
plentiful, and continuous inland water
transportation," he said, "have been
given much attention, but, in my opin
ion, the military value of such a sys
tem of waterways is not realized by
the public. The threatened railroad
strike, however, emphasized to the
navy department how grealy an ade
quate system of ; transportation by in
and waterways would add to national
preparedness, t
'The threat to stop rail transporta
tion in a way simulated war cbndi
tions. Realizing this, the navy depart
ment set about, : when the possibility
of a strike arose, to devise ways of
getting supplies and materials other
than by railroad.
"The vital points from which trans
portation must be secured were found
to be the Great Lakes, Schenectady,
Pittsburg and vicinity, New Haven
and vicinity, Bethlehem and vicinity,
Easton and vicinity and the coal fields
of West Virginia.
"The Massachusetts district was
found to be, with on or two minor ex
ceptions, easily reached by water. The
Erie canal solved the problem of all
the great manufacturers on the Great
Lakes, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland,
Buffalo and Milwaukee. The Lehigh
canal, although not kept up ' as it
should be, gave us relief from Easton.
The Delaware river provided an out
let from Philadelphia, Wilmington and
that section. The Hudson extended the
Erie canal's facilities to New York
and also provided an outlet for the
electrical material from Schnectady
and vicinity. ,
"When it came to Pittsburg, how
ever, trouble arose. It was first
thought that satisfactory deliveries
could be made from the Ohio river to
Portsmouth, thence by the Ohio and
Erie canal to Cleveland, or via the
Ohio to the Muskingum and thence via
the Ohio and Erie canal to Dresden.
These canals were represented as be
ing in active operation and prepara
tions were made to use these routes
if necessary. Both these routes had
been allowed to become useless be
cause of the failure of the state of
ovide annrgTiatiohs for
their upkeep. Similar conditions have
rendered useless the other waterways.
"Had these canals been kept up,
they would have enabled the depart
ment to ship heavy plates and the
necessary material for construction
and repair workf on battleships from
Pittsburg via canal directly to New
York. The failure to keep them up
necessitated the working out oi an
elaborate trolleyi route to. Buffalo,
which, at its best, would have pro
vided for only a small fraction of the
2,500 tons which were needed within
six weeks at the I New York yard
alone, and this in time of peace with
no war demands to be considered.
"The canal from Easton to Bristol
was found to be too small. The Le
high canal, being under the control of
railroads, was also in poor shape for
transportation, and, the Morris canal,
so far as information could be secur
ed, was practically out of business.
With these routes open and kept effi
cient, the all-important armor plate
district of Bethlehem would be free of
the necessity of using railroad trans
portation. ?
"In considering: the coal districts,
upon which a large portion of our
merchant vessels depend, the situa
tion was found tobe hopeless. With
out railroads, coal would lie idle at
the mines and ships would lie idle at
their moorings after a very brief ces
sation of railroad traffic. A water
system for these inines would appear
to be a most imperative military ne
cessity.
"Some of the tanals which we
would like to use in time of emergen
cy are leased to railroads by long-time
contracts and the '"railroads have not
kept them up or encouraged their use.
It would seem a wise military precau
tion, also, that t railroads leasing
canals should be -required to keep
them in operating condition under
penalty of forfeiture of lease. '

tion. He spoke as Carranza's official
representative. I.
-. t
shipbuilding plants, arms and muni-"
tion factories; powjder magazines, etc.,
are located along r near the Atlantic
coast. A system f adequate internal
waterways connecting all these ac
tivities would be of value beyond, es
timate. I
"As a concrete example of what it
would mean to the safety of the na
tion, I will indicate briefly the value
of a sufficiently jleep and wide canal
between the Delaware and Chesa
peake bays. Should our navy, in time
of war, meet a superior hostile fleet
along our middle or southern Atlantic
coast, Chesapeake Bay would natural
ly be the refuge' of any injured ships.
At such a timet the combined use of
the docks at Norfolk and Philadel
phia might be f vital. An adequate
canal between the two bays would ac
complish this big step toward pre
paredness.
'The same applies with equal force
to a canal between deep water in the
Delaware river land New York harbor
and Long Island Sound. This would
add twe more f exits to guard by a
blockader, thus pausing a still further
division of his orce, and divisions of
force, as you will readily understand,
are contrary toja principle of combat
cn which succes very largely depends
concentration.1
A system of canals connecting the
various ports . along our Atlantic
coast would facilitate and safeguard
the passage of submarines, destroy--ers,
torpedo boats, fast motor boats,
etc., up and dowp our coast, wherever
and whenever they might be needed.
"Information from abroad clearly
shows the immense economic and mil
itary importance of the canal sys
tems, particularly of Germany, in
time of war. Quick transportation of
war materials apd men, and the en
ormous and undreamed of demand for
supplies have been two outstanding
features of the present war.:
The military; needs alone have al
most exhausted - every transportation
