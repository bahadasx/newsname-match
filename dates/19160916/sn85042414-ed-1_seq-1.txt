Delville and Tributary Section Drenched in Blood of
Thousands Who Have Fallen Since Friday Morning
—Unusually Large Number of Guns at Work.
British Front in France, Sept. 16.—(Via London')—
Army officers universally are speaking of Friday as the
best day for British arms since the offensive began on the
Somme front. With the exception of Juyl 1, the attack
begun yesterday morning is the most extensive of any of
the ten weeks of battle. For the first time new armored
motor cars, of an ingenious pattern, suitable for crossing
trenches and shell holes, competed with the infantry as the
Britsh swept down from the ridges to the lower ground
toward Bapaum. .,,r
The British now are beyond the village of Flers.
which they took early in the morning and are established
in Martinpuich and Courcellett. The slow work of the re
cent weeks, which included the taking of Ginchv and Guil
lemont. had for its object the control of all the high ground
from the region of Thiepval to the junction with the
French on the right. The Germans fought hard for every
foot of it.
Delville, or Devils Wood, the highwood and a rib of
earth which windmills crowned beyond Pozieres, have been«t^$
steeped with the blood of men fallen there under the heav
iest shell fire in the history of the war.
The British push was largely down hill. Evidently
the Germans did not expect the attack, considering that the
offensive was over and the British would settle down for
the winter in their new positions.
Never before have more guns been playing over the
same length of front than along the six miles where the
British made the advance on July 1 and where they con
tinued the offensive. The Germans kept on bringing up
guns until now they have 1,000 in this short sector. The
British greatly increased their own artillery.
